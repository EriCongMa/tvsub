you were right about dan and rachel .
you have proof. give it to me .
if they find out that i let an outsider in
i &apos;ll protect you .
your own father was one of them
and you didn &apos;t even know it .
don &apos;t contact me again .
i &apos;m sorry for the interruption ,
but i have something
i think almost everyone here would want to see .
i &apos;m back at constance , got into yale .
everything &apos;s perfect again .
i thought you lied to me .
then why were you so ready to believe the worst ?
i think part of me wanted to .
it &apos;s over , isn &apos;t it ? - what are you doing here ?
i came to apologize . i don &apos;t know what came over me .
on the upper east side ,
all the world &apos;s a stage
and all the men and women merely players .
but once a year , constance / st .
jude &apos;s students shed their usual roles and
take on new ones for the senior class play .
this year &apos;s pick-- &quot; the age of innocence . &quot;
i just can &apos;t believe this is a senior requirement or that
chuck got a doctor to actually diagnose him with acute stage fright .
should have gone with mercury poisoning .
before &quot; gossip girl , &quot; there was edith wharton ,
and how little has changed .
the same society snobs still reigned ,
only in corsets and horse @-@ drawn carriages .
when i saw &quot; the age of innocence &quot; with daddy ,
i always pictured myself as winona ,
but playing the stronger ,
more emotionally complex female lead
just feels so right .
dorota , hairpin .
besides , you &apos;re so much more suited to play may , who &apos;s so ... pretty .
uh , thanks .
at last , my life is perfect .
my only problem-- how to relate to my character .
countess olenska is a ruined woman
with no prospects ,
and let &apos;s face it , i have the world on a string .
of course , there is the odious task of playing opposite dan humphrey .
dorota , enough. how are you two doing , b.t.w ?
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m just trying not to think of him , distracting myself with other ...
distractions .
you mean your crush on our director ?
julian is kind of amazing , isn &apos;t he ?
do you know that he directed
bogosian off @-@ broadway
in his last year of juilliard , blah , blah , blah ?
you can always depend on constance to snare some wunderkind .
but really , s . , aren &apos;t you sick of brooding artists ?
well , he broods in the sexiest way , that is ,
when he &apos;s not looking right through me .
oh , my life is so bountiful .
i don &apos;t need a boyfriend to feel fulfilled .
aah ! oh , my god ! come look at this !
but i do need silence to emotionally prepare for the stage .
what are you clucking about ?
nelly just got in early to yale .
uh , that &apos;s impossible .
yale only accepts one constance student early a year , and that &apos;s me .
she just got an e @-@ mail directly from dean berube .
i have to find headmistress queller .
julian , i added the fur collar to olenska &apos;s act two dress .
add fur to the cuffs. humphrey !
this is an invited dress. backstage now .
i can &apos;t believe i volunteered to do costumes .
oh , for the days of eleanor &apos;s atelier .
wait. did i really just say that ?
how did she even show her face after everthing she &apos;s done .
dan , remember , in scene three , you enter from stage right , not stage left .
stage left , right .
no. no , stage right.- yeah , i got it .
i just don &apos;t get why you want to do a documentary on all this .
are you kidding ?
a high school forks out a small fortune to stage a play ... okay .
hires broadway &apos;s hottest up @-@ and @-@ coming director--
that means you &apos;ve got wealth , privilege , atrocious acting .
and the fact that you &apos;re doing &quot; the age of innocence , &quot;
well , that &apos;s just the icing on the cake.- okay .
but don &apos;t worry . i won &apos;t make you look bad.- stop .
and whatever else ,
&quot; the age of innocence &quot; is one of the most beautiful books ever. ugh .
it &apos;s , like , the most boring book ever .
nothing happens .
guy and girl want to be together , but can &apos;t , end of story .
nate , the story &apos;s in the details .
the simple act of unbuttoning a glove expresses the character &apos;s
inner passion . i can think of a lot more interesting ways to express my passion .
oh , really ?
towards you .
chuck bass. it &apos;s good to see you , son .
mr. campbell , hello .
i , uh , i &apos;m sorry for your loss .
i was in prague for the funeral .
i would have paid my respects in person .
thank you . i &apos;ll come by the office .
i hear you &apos;re learning the ropes .
trying to .
enjoy. thanks .
is this okay ? - perfect .
my lucky day. carter baizen back in town .
a delight to see you , bass .
elle ? you &apos;re all right .
you have the wrong person. my name is hayley .
what are you doing with this loser ?
back off , bass. the , uh , lady says she doesn &apos;t know you .
she knows me . i know you &apos;re in some kind of trouble .
whatever kind of help you need ,
you &apos;re not going to find it with him .
carter , i have to use the ladies &apos; room .
get me a drink ? just--just wait a sec .
come on , bass. don &apos;t cause a scene .
heard you were in thailand recently .
of course i had to leave in a hurry .
you should have come to see me in singapore .
how was singapore ?
i &apos;m surprised you made it out in one piece .
i &apos;m hooked up on every continent .
i landed last night , rrolled into apothe and met ...
well , who really cares what her name is , right ?
god bless america .
mr. baizen ?
your date just exited through the kitchen .
welcome home .
hey. jacket over vest and button to top .
hello ? what &apos;s wrong with you ?
oh , um , no , it &apos;s--it &apos;s nothing .
did you see how those teachers treated rachel ?
yeah. they were like grown @-@ up mean girls .
if i wrote a note , could you deliver it ?
dan , headmistress queller told her to stay away from you .
i saw how they were treating her .
it &apos;s--it &apos;s--it &apos;s my fault .
i just want to know that she &apos;s okay .
hi , miss carr .
i love your necklace. is it new ?
uh , no. it &apos;s quite old , actually .
well , it &apos;s very nice .
丹
hi . i am gonna sit in front until the first costume change .
jenny , i @-@ i really don &apos;t think that ...
thanks .
this is just a dress rehearsal .
there are people out there. don &apos;t let the--
headmistress ! there you are .
nelly yuki claimed she got into yale early .
there must be some mistake .
i &apos;m sorry , blair. there &apos;s no mistake .
i was on my way to tell you
i received a call from dean berube .
they &apos;ve rescinded your acceptance
and given the spot to nelly .
is today april fool &apos;s ?
though i had previously informed yale of your detention ,
i did not tell them what the punishment was for .
but apparently , an anonymous caller did .
the dean called for me to confirm the story .
i had no choice .
but i did penance for that .
i explained that you made amends ,
but yale considers hazing a faculty member a very serious offense .
i &apos;m sorry .
there must be something we can do .
blair , it &apos;s over .
you will not be attending yale .
every actress eventually finds the hook into her character ,
even if sometimes life has to give her a little push .
waldorf , you &apos;re holding up the curtain .
come. now .
upon my soul , it &apos;s countess olenska ,
parading herself at the opera .
it &apos;s a pity. her life is finished .
but don &apos;t worry , b .
when god closes a door , he opens a play .
elle .
i need your help .
oh , did you tell my cousin ellen of our engagement ?
i hadn &apos;t had the chance .
oh , well , you mustn &apos;t. she &apos;s been away so long .
did i miss much ?
oh , no , just the first scene .
hey , jenny , you dropped your ...
oh. wait. can i ...
may knows as well as i do the real reason of her cousin staying away .
but i shall never let her see the least sign that i &apos;m
conscious of there being a shadow on poor ellen olenska &apos;s reputation .
雷切尔
get me out of this. out of my way .
i need to make the fat lady sing .
pull !
it &apos;s stuck .
no , leave it. she &apos;ll need as much padding as possible .
what is your problem ?
my problem is a two @-@ faced ,
four @-@ eyed devious little snipe in a fat suit .
did you really think you could
rat me out to yale and get away with it ?
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
everyone &apos;s jealous of me because my life is perfect ,
and you &apos;ve always been the most jealous of all .
people aren &apos;t jealous of you , blair. they hate you .
i didn &apos;t call yale ,
and good luck figuring out who did .
there are about a thousand people
who would relish taking you down .
wanna hear the sickest scandal ever ?
remember b . &apos; s lord ?
it turns out he was giving the royal treatment to his own queen mother ,
and the worst part ?
b. knew and ignored it .
how desperate can you be , b . ?
no wonder yale dumped you. who wants inbred legacies ?
someone &apos;s out to get you , blair. it &apos;s just not me .
vanessa .
julian. hey , i made the adjustment
you suggested in the garden scene .
uh , yeah , yeah. um , good show , sabrina .
so how does it feel to play may welland ?
well , it feels like my character &apos;s rubbing off on me .
may &apos;s fiance pays no attention to her , and as for me ...
are you talking about julian ?
well , the play opens tomorrow. he &apos;s just distracted .
julian , hey .
i was just thinking ,
it would be really helpful for my friend vanessa &apos;s
documentary to hear more about your vision for the show .
why don &apos;t we all grab a bite to eat ?
i suppose it couldn &apos;t hurt to , uh ,
give my actors a little more insight into my intentions .
let me just grab my stuff . i &apos;ll meet you in front .
airing my dirty laundry to yale
and sending the lord marcus &quot; gossip girl &quot; blast
makes you officially my enemy number one .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about , blair .
honestly.- what are you doing with her ? we hate her .
i don &apos;t hate her. she &apos;s my friend , actually .
and you just need to calm down .
calm down , serena ? she got me axed from yale .
you &apos;re seriously taking her side ?
fine .
but a word of advice-- she will be destroyed ,
and you don &apos;t want to become collateral damage .
thank you .
i &apos;ve been bathing like the french
in restaurant bathrooms all week .
so you &apos;ve been on the run .
you know , i wanted to contact you .
i felt like we had a connection .
but i was scared .
and carter ?
i just met him .
he told me he was rich , so i thought he could help .
please .
look , no one is going to hurt you .
are you kidding ?
you know the kind of people who are members .
they &apos;re powerful men ,
and the things i know about them could destroy their lives .
nobody ever told me that once you &apos;re in , you &apos;re in for good .
if only i could just leave the country ,
start over with a clean slate .
so that &apos;s what you &apos;ll do .
money &apos;s not a problem .
we &apos;ll get you a new identity , a new passport .
how ?
i know a guy .
thank you .
just one question .
how do you feel about brazil ?
scorsese said that he considers &quot; age of innocence &quot;
more violent than his films with guns and blood .
marty &apos;s inspiration was &quot; the heiress . &quot;
william wyler .
so you &apos;re a wyler fan ? have you ever seen &quot; little foxes &quot; ?
are you kidding ?
serena made me see it , like , what , three times ?
she &apos;s obsessed with bette davis .
yeah , bette davis .
i , um ...
i love her eyes . her hair is harlow gold .
hey , listen . i &apos;m gonna take off , okay ?
i &apos;ll come with .
oh , i was just gonna tell you my take on the play .
yes , that &apos;s a great idea .
don &apos;t go , please .
nate , do you mind ?
no , no . it &apos;s , uh , it &apos;s cool . listen i have ...
lines to practice anyway , so i &apos;ll go now .
so ...
you know , uh , nate &apos;s got the right idea .
i didn &apos;t realize how late it was .
let me just grab the check .
thank god .
serena , i know you like him , but as your friend ,
julian is the most self @-@ absorbed ,
pompous person i &apos;ve ever met .
all he does is go on and on about classic movies ,
and it &apos;s totally annoying .
you were keeping up with him pretty good there .
yeah , and i &apos;m totally annoying .
thanks , ladies . don &apos;t worry . it &apos;s taken care of .
and , uh , it &apos;s been a lot of fun .
it has .
uh , you know ,
all this talk about bette davis has--has
really got me thinking about my character .
you know , i think i could use some
more coaching before the show .
what do you say ?
sure . say 4 : 00 ? text me your address .
great .
so what are you up to ?
you mean , what are we up to ?
i may not be a huge classic film buff ,
but i have read &quot; cyrano . &quot;
hey . sorry . when i finally came out , you were gone . so ...
you were great in the play . i just--
no , i @-@ i meant with rachel .
do you , like--did she respond ?
uh , yeah . she wrote a note .
all right , w @-@ well , great . where is it ?
um , dad has it .
mr. humphrey--
i believe this belongs to you .
poor miss iowa-- caught playing mrs. robinson .
looks like the teacher just got schooled .
dan , we need to talk .
well , i &apos;ve got nothing to say .
i went to see miss carr last night .
this thing between the two of you--it &apos;s over .
well , we &apos;ll see .
you cannot be this short @-@ sighted .
if word gets out about this , you &apos;ll be expelled .
miss carr will be fired for good .
well , miss carr is the one who sent me the key .
so presumably , she understands that risk
and she &apos;s making her own decision .
however grown @-@ up you think you are ,
you &apos;re still in high school .
i care about rachel , all right ? and i &apos;m 18 .
so with all due respect , i think i &apos;ll decide who i see .
oh , do go on , newland .
i do love your descriptions .
well , why shouldn &apos;t we make them real ?
we shall , my dearest , of course , next year .
see , may is all about what &apos;s proper .
you &apos;ve read other wharton novels , right ?
&quot; the house of mirth &quot; ?
yes. yes , i @-@ i have .
good , because &quot; house of mirth &quot;
was a huge influence on clayton .
jack clayton . he directed &quot; the great gatsby . &quot;
jack clayton , &quot; gatsby . &quot;
most critics consider it a failed adaptation .
no offense , mr. film fanatic ,
but i @-@ i don &apos;t think the movie was nearly as good as the book .
i don &apos;t disagree .
why do you say so ?
some blame clayton &apos;s direction ,
others point the finger at coppola &apos;s screenplay .
in &quot; the times , &quot; vincent canby said--
whoa . slow down .
excuse me ?
no excuse me .
it &apos;s just that sometimes my thoughts come so fast that i , uh ,
i get confused .
sorry .
from now on , i &apos;ll say a line ,
and all you have to do is repeat it exactly .
you &apos;re quite right .
the film is ... impotent .
it totally misses what the book is even about--
the eternal conflict between the repression of
society and the passion of the individual .
you are so insightful , julian .
i completely agree about the power of unexpressed passion .
you know , you are so insightful , julian .
i completely agree about the power of unexpressed passion .
i have to confess , i underestimated you .
you &apos;re quite extraordinary .
shall we get back to the scene ?
what was that ?
i &apos;m sorry . just one second .
it &apos;s a text .
yale &apos;s hallowed halls have gone to hell .
s. got accepted , but not for her s.a.t. scores .
allowing a press release was her only prerequisite .
i have to go .
i @-@ i lost track of time again .
we &apos;re late for the theater . are you ready to go ?
yeah . yeah .
good to see you , hayley .
or should i call you elle ?
sorry i ran off like that .
i just didn &apos;t know if i could trust you or not .
baizen , you know i &apos;m not your biggest fan ,
but you are an expert at crossing borders .
i &apos;m happy to oblige .
especially if it means having chuck bass owe me a favor .
but my passport guy-- he &apos;s a bit of a paranoid freak .
he won &apos;t like an entourage .
i understand .
look , you take elle , and i &apos;ll meet you at teterboro .
it &apos;s okay .
thank you . i &apos;m so grateful .
don &apos;t worry , bass .
we &apos;ll take care of her .
i &apos;ve lost everything .
i &apos;m humiliated and shunned .
they &apos;ve made me a flesh @-@ and @-@ blood countess olenska .
you are an actress .
pour it into the role. use pain onstage .
you &apos;re right .
i &apos;m an actress .
no ...
i &apos;m a seagull .
no , you &apos;re a shameless bitch .
now what ?
everything you &apos;ve done
spreading rumors about who i &apos;ve had sex with ,
what alley i puked in
or telling dean berube that i killed pete fairman
i forgave everything all because i thought one
day you &apos;d grow up , but putting out a &quot; gossip girl &quot; blast
about yale and the press release
serena , i didn &apos;t put out the blast .
at least have the dignity not to lie to my face .
wait. but i &apos;m not lying .
only two people knew about it--you and dan
and dan would never do something like that .
i always want to believe the best in you , blair .
the bottom line is , betrayal &apos;s in your nature .
i didn &apos;t do it , dorota .
i believe you , miss blair .
and if i didn &apos;t , that means dan humphrey did .
vanessa told him about marcus , and he could &apos;ve put that out , too ,
all to get back at me for teacher @-@ gate .
do you know how hard it is to get revenge
when your enemy is changing every five minutes ?
you need to calm nerves and warm vocal chord. you want tea ?
no , i want dan humphrey &apos;s head on a platter .
rachel , hey , hey . i &apos;ve been looking for you everywhere .
we have to talk .
no , no , dan. we need to stay away from each other .
my dad showed up at your house .
we need to at least discuss this .
people are coming .
it was reckless of me to respond to your note .
rachel ...
what are we doing ?
i @-@ i can &apos;t help myself .
am i supposed to pretend i &apos;m not feeling what i &apos;m feeling ?
you know this can &apos;t last .
what can &apos;t ?
our staying away from each other .
oh , mother &apos;s carriage has arrived .
do excuse me , dear .
of course .
so what happened with julian ?
we were in the middle of it , and then you just hung up .
oh , sorry . i had to get off the phone .
but i shall never let her see the least signs that i am
conscious of there being a shadow on poor ellen olenska &apos;s reputation .
i &apos;ll explain later .
the next day ,
mrs . manson mingott received the young couple at a large
house in an inaccessible wilderness in the central park .
girl , bring me my fan .
yes. right away , ma &apos;am .
mr. archer and miss welland .
at last .
i was beginning to think you were so besotted
with love you &apos;d forgotten about your old grandmother .
and when is the wedding to be ?
thank you for meeting me , mr. campbell .
oh , it &apos;s my pleasure , chuck .
your father was one of my closest friends .
which is why i was hoping you could help me with something .
my father was a member of a club .
oh , i can get you off the waiting list at any place in town. just name it .
i &apos;m not talking racket sports. this is a gentlemen &apos;s club .
as it happens , carter baizen is a member , too .
i &apos;m not acquainted with mr. baizen .
yesterday , park avenue winter ?
you left right when he did .
i don &apos;t remember when i left .
and i don &apos;t know anything about a gentlemen &apos;s club .
the club moves every month .
there are girls there .
my. my , my .
well , chuck ...
i have no idea what you &apos;re talking about .
someone i care about is in trouble ,
and this club has something to do with it .
now knowing my father was a member ,
it only stands to reason that his closest friends were , too .
when i go to the authorities ,
i &apos;ll have to suggest they investigate everyone .
i &apos;m sorry about your friend , but i don &apos;t know anything that could help .
have a good evening .
mr. campbell , please .
i care about her .
i can &apos;t say anything .
eastview hotel 10 : 30p.m.
the great uta hagen used to tell actors ,
&quot; give birth to the new person you are to become . &quot;
well , with act one behind you and act two looming , my friends ,
you are still in labor .
i feel like i &apos;m in labor .
remember , being onstage ...
is like standing on the edge of a cliff .
what saves you is the love and trust you have in each other .
also , my friend , the renowned &quot; new york times &quot; theater critic ,
charles isherwood , is in the audience , and if you embarrass me ,
i will kill you. now go .
mr. isherwood , thank you so much for coming .
thank you .
are you enjoying the show ?
yes. yes .
what happened to you ? you were supposed to come by and get me .
i &apos;m sorry .
you stood me up and your only explanation is &quot; sorry &quot; ?
nate , what is going on ?
nate , i told you .
your character went bankrupt , suffered total public humiliation .
not that you would understand that .
the characters in this play are smoldering tempests of emotion .
you &apos;re ... as empty as ...
the federal reserve .
nate , wait .
no . i gotta go work on my smoldering tempest of emotion .
don &apos;t you think that was a little harsh ?
directors push buttons to get performances .
put your camera on a tripod. come watch the show .
what a pretty carriage .
every time i see you , you happen to me all over again .
ellen , you might be the most honest woman i &apos;ve ever met .
what the hell are you doing ?
oh , no , but one of the least fussy .
you &apos;re trying to ruin my life. you &apos;re insane .
you must know that this can &apos;t last .
what can &apos;t ?
our being together ...
and not being together .
don &apos;t try to gaslight me , humphrey .
i know you &apos;re just seeking revenge
because i ruined your chances with the simpy iowa
teacher .
and incredible as it may seem ,
not everyone spends their lives trying to plot revenge .
you ought not to have come today .
i look forward to seeing you .
every thought is burnt up in a great flame .
someone is out to get me , and all signs point to you .
you &apos;re the only one who knew it all. it has to be you .
six or seven days passed ,
and archer heard nothing from madam olenska .
then one day , the newland archers received an invitation
to dine at mrs.mingott &apos;s .
may , what a pretty gown .
oh , thank you. how are you feeling , granny ?
people tell me i &apos;m old and ill , but i feel perfectly fine .
hey. here .
that charm will prove useful when &quot; beu @-@ fort &quot; arrives .
i want him to feel welcomed. uh , beau @-@ beaufort .
oh. right. beaufort .
granny ?
my child , your beauty never wanes .
ellen , it &apos;s been too long .
much too long , cousin .
it was--it was really great of julian to let vanessa film it .
i guess she says he &apos;s an amazing director. is that right ?
nate , that &apos;s your cue. go , go ! okay. sorry .
beaufort , so , so good of you to come .
uh , they say you &apos;ve been abroad .
well , yes . i &apos;ve--i &apos;ve been , um ...
i &apos;ve been , um , you ...
uh , they--they say you &apos;ve been abroad , right ?
yes . i &apos;ve , um ... he &apos;s always had trouble with this line .
i ...
you know what ? whatever. y @-@ y @-@ you want feelings ?
well , i @-@ i @-@ i hate these clothes ,
i hate this play and i hate pretentious
asshats who try and steal other people &apos;s girlfriends .
in fact ,
i might just spontaneously punch one next time you get in my face .
i know just how mr .
beaufort feels-- working so hard for something
and losing it because people are out to destroy you .
well , countess ,
at least you don &apos;t have to go through your whole life
worried your best friend will humiliate and betray you .
i hate this fat suit. oh , and there &apos;s one other thing .
my whole family lost all of our money
before my father went to jail for embezzlement .
so i think i know more about humiliation andbankruptcy ...
all right , all right. than some lame dilettante director. okay ?
oh , what amusing companions. no , stop .
oh ... my ... god .
why don &apos;t we retire to the parlor , uh , for some port ?
no . i &apos;m damned with van der luyden .
all right .
shakespeare says , &quot; all &apos;s well that ends well , &quot;
and then sometimes it just ends .
nate had already ruined everything .
you high school idiots turned my play into a travesty ,
embarrassed me professionally .
julian , it &apos;s charles isherwood .
charles. please , i @-@ i can explain. explain what ? i loved it .
the classic interpretation of the first act juxtaposed with the radical
deconstruction of the second act--genius .
really ? you--you thought it was genius ?
yeah , i did .
the repressed characters melding with the actual kids
aggressively expressing their feelings-- how did you come up with it ?
well , as soon as i saw all that raw , adolescent emotion ,
i @-@ i @-@ i knew i had to use it , harness it , spin it into gold .
well , congratulations .
i look forward to seeing what you do next .
g--that &apos;s great. thank you for coming. thanks .
wow. that was a whole new level of fake .
i &apos;m going to look for my boyfriend. good job .
you know , i don &apos;t know why i ever had a crush on you .
serena ...
i &apos;m gay .
nate , wh-- what happened up there ?
i know you &apos;re into him , and i get it .
i mean , he &apos;s older , he &apos;s smarter , and you guys like the same stuff .
i can &apos;t compete. you what ?
i came to the gallery today and heard you on the phone .
oh , my god. are you talking about julian ?
i was talking to serena. she was with him .
she &apos;s the one who likes him , not me .
this is a total misunderstanding .
well , you know , that doesn &apos;t change the facts .
all right ? i mean , we have nothing in common .
i like espn , okay , and you like ...
books and movies .
the way you say that ...
you didn &apos;t even bother to read &quot; age of innocence . &quot;
you didn &apos;t watch the dvd i gave you .
you &apos;re like a kid who swears he hates
tomatoes and has never even tried one .
maybe you should be with a guy like julian who already likes tomatoes .
maybe if you would put in some effort , you wouldn &apos;t be so insecure .

chuck. how did you-- escape ? turns out they didn &apos;t want to hurt me .
they just wanted me to sign an agreement .
they gave me some cash and told me to get out of town .
that &apos;s great .
sao paolo awaits .
sao paolo ? brazil .
i can still help you get settled ,
and we can make a plan together .
chuck , i am really grateful that you were willing to help me ,
but all i needed was someone to give me money .
now i have more than enough ,
and i &apos;ve already made a plan ...
by myself .
so you were just using me ?
you &apos;ve got a good heart .
you should give it to somebody who cares .
hi. that was some performance .
it was nothing compared to yours. what do you mean ?
you called yale , sent the blast in to &quot; gossip girl &quot;
to get revenge on blair .
i believed in you .
all your talk about integrity and ideals .
my ideals ?
blair spread false rumors , blackmailed the school ,
turned my job into a sham with no repercussions .
you &apos;re just as bad as she is .
no , you &apos;re--you &apos;re worse .
blair is a high schooler. you &apos;re an adult .
you need to fix things with blair .
absolutely not .
you know how you felt when your ideals were crushed ?
well , congratulations. you &apos;ve crushed mine .
hey , blair .
it &apos;s--it &apos;s rachel who &apos;s been messing with you ,
and we had sex in the costume closet ,
so you can do whatever you want with that .
student sex in the costume closet-- is
that what they mean by heartland values ?
i at least expected a denial .
no . i don &apos;t deny it .
well , the headmistress told me my fate at yale is sealed .
so the question is , how do i make your fate as bleak as mine ?
i don &apos;t know what &apos;s happened to me .
i ... don &apos;t know what i &apos;ve become .
i &apos;m ...
so sorry .
well , your punishment is ...
just ...
live with it .
i should know .
it &apos;s not easy .
serena .
so just so you know ,
blair isn &apos;t responsible for--for sending out that blast about yale .
i am .
you ?
yeah , well , i told rachel about yale wanting to put out the press release ,
and she sent it in to &quot; gossip girl . &quot;
but w @-@ why would you do that ?
i was trying to explain to her that you aren &apos;t like the other
girls here and-- i @-@ i gotta go find blair .
thank you for telling me .
i &apos;m ... so sorry .
and i get it if you don &apos;t want to talk to me right now ,
but the fact is ,
i come bearing snacks ,
hoping that we can cuddle on the couch and watch espn .
come here .
you &apos;re watching &quot; the age of innocence &quot; ?
it &apos;s heartbreaking .
so are you .
i am a way better beaufort .
i &apos;m--i &apos;m sorry .
i @-@ i know you were just looking out for me .
and rachel--well , she , uh ,
she turned out to be not who i thought she was
or at least not anymore .
i &apos;m sorry , too , son .
dad , you were right about this , but i think you ...
need to give me space to make my own mistakes .
well ...
lucky for you , you &apos;ll be at yale soon .
you can make all the mistakes you want , with , god @-@ willing ,
girls your own age .
b . , i &apos;ve been looking everywhere for you .
i know that was rachel that sent the &quot; gossip girl &quot; blast .
i &apos;m sorry i didn &apos;t believe you .
why would you ?
what do you mean ?
believe me .
nine times out of ten , i would have sent the blast .
like you said , betrayal &apos;s in my nature .
i didn &apos;t mean that .
spare me , serena .
i don &apos;t need a stirring speech telling me what a good person i am .
i know i &apos;m not .
yale kicking me out is the karma i &apos;ve earned .
blair .
could you please leave ?
i want to be alone .
you &apos;re still my best friend .
in life , as in art , some endings are bittersweet ,
especially when it comes to love .
so i know i sucked at the role of messenger ,
but i found this by the door ,
so i thought i &apos;d try again .
thanks .
dan , i am going back to iowa , as you must have known .
i am sorry for everything .
as edith wharton wrote , &quot; there is no one as kind as you ,
&quot; no one who gave me reasons i
understood for doing what at first seemed so hard . &quot;
thank you. r .
sometimes fate throws two lovers together ,
only to rip them apart .
miss blair is out , mr. chuck .
i &apos;ll wait .
sometimes the hero finally makes the
right choice but the timing is all wrong .
and as they say , timing is everything .
hello , beautiful .
carter .
what are you doing here ?
buying you a drink .
looks like this story might just have a second act .
let &apos;s hope it &apos;s not a tragedy .
