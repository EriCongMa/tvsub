i come bearing gifts --
pimento cheese sandwiches ,
toasted with the crusts cut off .
eartha kitk &apos;s recipe .
it &apos;s a fantastic story .
what do you know about tom ?
lizzy , i &apos;m not sure if i can shed any --
no ! we &apos;re not doing that .
not today .
you have been threatening
to tell me the truth about my husband since the day we met ,
and i &apos;m ready to listen .
what do you know ?
little more than you .
several years ago , it came to my attention
that somebody was meddling in my business .
to protect myself and my interests ,
i inventoried my vulnerabilities .
me .
among others .
lizzy , i &apos;ve been monitoring tom
since he entered your life .
about a year ago ,
i discovered that he had purchased three passports
from a trusted forger i use in warsaw .
that &apos;s it ?
he bought passports ?
my husband chose me .
he inserted himself into my life because of you .
i can only assume that &apos;s the case .
why ?
how are we connected ?
that is just a distraction .
no , that is all that matters !
this is my life !
tell me !
right now , the only thing that matters
is the immediate threat -- your husband --
finding out who he is and who he works for .
the rest will come .
i promise you .
what &apos;s this ?
surveillance footage ,
taken by the people who were hired to watch you and tom .
&quot; the apple man . &quot;
you watched them ?
some .
enough .
perhaps you &apos;ll see something that i could not .
he wants to renew our vows .
things are unraveling for him .
he &apos;s desperate to keep you close .
i think you &apos;ve been presented
with a unique opportunity .
the people tom works for are obviously very cautious .
they operate slowly from the shadows .
i &apos;ve spent years tracking them , to no avail .
we now have a chance to draw them out .
things will have to appear normal to tom ,
to cooper , and the others .
which is why you &apos;ll need a case .
yesterday in brooklyn ,
a taxi drove into the back of a truck
under the 86th street &quot; l &quot; train ,
killing the driver and his female passenger .
it &apos;s being reported as an accident ,
but i suspect , in fact , it may be murder ,
the work of the undertaker .
he &apos;s a broker of death ,
a man who somehow convinces ordinary people
to kill on his behalf .
murder / suicide is his signature .
how he recruits , nobody knows ,
but if this accident is his work ,
it gives you a rare glimpse into the way he operates
and a chance to find him .
i &apos;ll be back in d.c. on thursday .
have senator chapman &apos;s office set a lunch .
we can talk about it then .
have the committee chairman join us , as well .
tell him it &apos;s mandatory .
yes .
yes . you have my word .
nothing will happen before then .
okay .
y @-@ you bennett cochran ?
i am .
hey , hey . what the hell ?
please forgive me . i have a brother .
bennett cochran was killed
by a woman who was mentally unstable ,
dee torres .
local police consider both cases accidental --
a runaway cab and a woman suffering from a mental break .
but according to reddington ,
these are assassination by suicide .
they call him the undertaker ,
a man who somehow turns ordinary people
into contract killers .
reddington believes that , in all of these cases ,
the killer died along with the victim .
complete strangers in different cities ,
assassins who can &apos;t talk because they &apos;re dead .
that &apos;s what he &apos;s selling to his clients --
the perfect murder .
who are his clients ?
who hires this guy , and who does he work for ?
according to reddington ,
he contracts with clients around the world --
anyone interested in hiring a killer
致两人死亡
without the slightest possibility
of it ever tracing back to them .
start with the killers &apos; families .
see what they know .
hey , milt . one for the morgue , bro .
wahid worked seven days a week .
i begged him , slow down , scale back .
he wouldn &apos;t have any of it .
i &apos;m sure you have bills , like everyone else .
he probably felt -- - no .
wahid didn &apos;t have to work ,
not since haroon passed .
haroon ?
wahid &apos;s uncle in pakistan .
i didn &apos;t even know he had an uncle .
he left you money ?
yes . we only received the inheritance a few months ago .
he was beginning to forget things .
maybe it was worse than i thought .
i blame myself .
he shouldn &apos;t have been behind that wheel .
we found a connection .
the killers both had terminal illnesses .
they were gonna die .
this is wahid davi &apos;s brain scan .
he had a rapidly accelerating brain tumor .
and dee torres -- her autopsy showed
she had late @-@ stage cervical cancer ,
less than a month to live .
the undertaker recruits the terminally ill as assassins ?
yes . and both killers had additional problems --
dementia , mental instability --
conditions that made it possible
for the police to explain away the events .
well , they also had motives .
their families are now suddenly free from financial hardship .
the cabbie received an unexpected inheritance ,
and dee torres ,
her brother is now getting around @-@ the @-@ clock care ,
thanks to ghost payments
from an anonymous foundation in oregon .
these killings are being financed .
i don &apos;t give a damn where the money &apos;s going .
i want to know where it &apos;s coming from .
get into this guy &apos;s financial life .
cigarette ?
not supposed to smoke in here .
what are they gonna do ?
kill you ?
i paid 21 years .
when i reapplied ,
they said my rates had doubled
because i had a heart condition .
couldn &apos;t afford it .
well , what i want to offer you
is something better than life insurance , danny --
the promise that everyone you love
will be taken care of --
your mortgage ,
so claire won &apos;t lose the house on crestview ,
tuition , so carolyn can afford college .
who are you ?
total value of what i &apos;m offering
paid out over the lifetimes of your wife and daughter
would be ...
keep talking .
craig ?
come here , brother !
what the hell are you doing here ? what is all this ?
you said you wanted to renew our vows .
yeah .
there &apos;s no time like the present .
i can &apos;t believe you guys are getting married twice
before i get married once .
yeah . hi .
we just talked about it yesterday .
so , craig , when did you get in ?
liz called me this morning . i got the first flight out .
work has been insane ,
and we &apos;ve had to put so many things off ,
and i &apos;m not doing it anymore .
i want to marry this man !
cheers !
now , go get dressed .
and , oh , just make sure he shaves .
i &apos;m not marrying george michael .
you shouldn &apos;t be here .
yeah ? you think i didn &apos;t try ?
you know what ? you should thank me .
i called you the minute i knew .
yeah . lot of good that did .
she was asking about our parents .
the accident ?
yeah . the accident , tucson .
i think she knows .
no . she doesn &apos;t know anything .
you honestly don &apos;t see it , do you ?
how far in over your head you are .
she knows exactly what she &apos;s doing .
this chick is smart .
look , man . relax .
i know what i am doing . i know to read this woman .
why do you think i asked her to renew our vows ?
to get her in bed ?
come on . give me a break .
yeah ? well , i hope your b.s. is exceptional today .
because in less than five minutes ,
you &apos;re gonna fall in love all over again .
thanks , brother .
when i &apos;m with you , liz ,
i feel like i don &apos;t need to pretend .
i know that you accept me
for who i really am ,
and that &apos;s a gift
that i thank god for every day .
and that &apos;s all i got .
tom ...
everyone ...
thing is , when you asked me to renew our vows ,
i thought it was ... odd .
and then i realized ,
how much we &apos;ve been through in such a short time .
so much has changed .
but the more i thought about it ,
i realized this is the beginning of something amazing .
a new chapter , a new us .
and i wanted to take this opportunity
to stand in front of you ,
and all of our friends ,
everyone we love ,
and tell you how excited i am about what &apos;s coming next .
because i have a feeling this is going to be ...
one hell of a ride .
okay . by the power vested in me ,
by the online universal life church ...
... i once again pronounce you husband and wife .
this is the kissing part .
yeah , yes .
you kiss .
yes .
kiss .

raymond said you needed something .
could you have him run these prints ,
get me a name ?
what ?
this paint-- what color is it ?
it &apos;s called &quot; chicago skyline . &quot;
nice .
i looked into the accounts of the two suicide killers ,
and i found a common thread .
both accounts are receiving funds
from a bank in the caymans notorious for laundering money .
the undertaker &apos;s bank account .
better .
i think i uncovered his payment network . look at this .
dozens of accounts from all around the world ,
all receiving some form of payment .
he &apos;s been doing this for years .
it &apos;s in boston , tokyo ,
seattle , mexico city .
got to payouts in the tens of millions .
a network of dead assassins .
not all of them .
danny moss , 54,
resident of dorchester , mass .
21 hours ago , mr. moss sent wire transfer instructions
to the same cayman bank that funds the other accounts .
let me guess-- danny is dying .
congestive heart failure .
get a unit to his house , now .
moss isn &apos;t home .
wife said he left the house 20 minutes ago .
where did she say he was going ?
you have my commitment to rolling up my sleeves every day
and working for you and for this great city .
thank you . thank you , everybody .
thank you .
appreciate it .
we &apos;re with you !
make sure i get the photo op ,
so that they can know me , okay ?
yeah , you &apos;re right .
mr. wright ?
do i know you ?
i &apos;m sorry .
i am really sorry .
danny , stop ! danny ! stop !
back up ! fbi ! fbi !
back up ! fbi !
danny , stop !
back up !
please .
this isn &apos;t how your wife or daughter want to remember you .
please .
this is for my family .
i don &apos;t even know you .
put the gun down .
whatever he &apos;s paying you , it isn &apos;t worth it . we can help .
don &apos;t do this .
are you gonna take care of my family ?
is this really how you want to die ?
professor , someone to see you .
cvetko , you rascal .
you wouldn &apos;t believe how hard it is
to find a bosnian in san salvador .
wish it was harder .
oh , this looks rather ghoulish .
vlad , i need your help identifying somebody .
can &apos;t help .
of course you can .
i have a fingerprint .
benson ran it , got a name .
benson -- there &apos;s your problem .
she says the print belongs to a craig keen .
well , craig keen is an alias --
a very good one at that ,
complete with a credit rating ,
school and medical records , passports with a long history --
all the trimmings .
no .
what do you know about touch dna ?
i said no .
i know very little , but as i understand it ,
it &apos;s possible to actually lift tissue cells
from a fingerprint and run the dna ?
is that right ?
you slept with my wife .
how is fadila ?
vlad , it was a mistake .
i can easily blame it on the hashish and the grappa ,
but the truth is --
may i speak freely ?
you &apos;re better off without her .
she &apos;s fickle .
i &apos;m sorry ,
but this business with the fingerprint --
it &apos;s important .
do you still have that little villa in dubrovnik ?
i do .
a weekend there with fadila .
she would love it .
i can &apos;t understand why you insist on chasing that woman .
all right . the villa is yours .
and if it doesn &apos;t work out with fadila ,
i know a ravishing dane
who would adore you .
she &apos;s slightly cross @-@ eyed
and there &apos;s something very hypnotic about her gaze .
keen .
how &apos;s your case developing , lizzy ?
we have one of the assassins in custody .
we &apos;re taking him in for questioning now .
have you figured out how he selects them ,
the common denominator ?
they &apos;re all sick .
we know from their autopsies they &apos;re terminally ill .
well , there you have it .
you only know these assassins were ill
because of their autopsies and police reports .
you know after they &apos;re already dead .
but somehow , the undertaker knows before .
find out how he knows that , and you &apos;ll find your man .
where are we with craig ?
is he still in town ?
a @-@ as far as i know .
good . find him .
watch him .
did you find his name ?
yes .
i think it &apos;s time for the three of us to have a little chat .
hey , craig . can we talk ?
who do you work for ?
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
who do you work for ? !
please , look . this has got to be some -- aah !
i know who you are .
i know about the time you did at wasco .
i know about the warrants .
i know about you , christopher maly .
i don &apos;t know who the hell ...
somebody provided you with an identity , a history ,
embedded you into my life .
i want to know who , and i want to know why .
this is a mistake .
you have no idea who you &apos;re dealing with .
i never did like you .
ressler , hey , what &apos;s up ?
yeah . of course . no .
i &apos;ll be right there .
you didn &apos;t exactly think this through , did you ?
actually ...
i did .
looks like we &apos;re a little late to the party .
you must be the brother @-@ in @-@ law .
ressler called .
i have to step out .
he isn &apos;t cooperating .
oh , hell . dembe , get the hacksaw .
we &apos;re gonna have to take him out of here in pieces .
i &apos;m just kidding .
we &apos;ll get old christopher to talk .
who &apos;s up for a field trip ?
i interviewed danny moss .
he can &apos;t i.d. the guy who put him up to the shooting .
but get this --
he offered danny a cigarette .
so ?
reddington said this guy knows his assassins are sick
before he recruits them .
this guy knew danny had heart failure .
this guy knew he smoked .
how did he know that ?
he somehow had access to his medical files .
how ? his doctors ?
that &apos;s what i thought .
but dee torres , danny moss --
the assassins all had different doctors .
insurance companies have access .
they all had different health plans .
what about life insurance ?
hold on .
wahid davi , dee torres , and danny moss
all had life @-@ insurance applications or policies
canceled by the same insurance agency , green glades .
hey . can i ask for a favor ?
about today , i got to be somewhere .
tom ?
yeah .
is that what this is about -- why you were , uh , absent ?
take all the time you need .
terrifying .
you know , this artist got his start with puppets .
what is it about puppets ? it &apos;s the same with clowns .
i &apos;ll never forget a puppet show i saw
when i was 5 , maybe 6 .
&quot; hansel and gretel . &quot;
why are we here ?
scared me to death .
but it wasn &apos;t the witch . it was the oven .
imagine an oven puppet .
i don &apos;t think i set foot in our kitchen for a month .
i don &apos;t know what you think you &apos;re gonna gain from all this ,
but i &apos;m not gonna talk .
i will die before i give you anything .
if you so much as touch my mother ...
god , i miss bob ross .
that television painter
with the little squirrel on his shoulder
and the happy little trees .
few strokes with a palette knife
and an entire mountain range
would emerge through the clouds --
absolutely mesmerizing .
well , let &apos;s go back to the hotel .
i think i saw some yogurt pretzels in your mini bar .
so , we &apos;re specifically looking for the policy files
for a wahid davi , a dee torres , and a danny moss .
i looked up those names after you called .
and the thing is ,
we don &apos;t have any active files on any of those names .
when you say these people don &apos;t have active files with you ,
what does that mean ?
i mean , these people have
life @-@ insurance policies with you .
well , i mean , if they were dropped ,
then they would have been purged from the system .
dropped and purged why ?
good god . any number of reasons .
uh , medical conditions , change of lifestyle --
it &apos;s -- it &apos;s like a whole formula .
i mean , if you guys want to talk actuarial tables ,
then milton &apos;s your man .
milton ...
bobbit .
he &apos;s where all policies go to die .
what do you mean &quot; go to die &quot; ?
no , it &apos;s nothing .
it &apos;s just we -- we like to joke about milton .
he &apos;s -- he &apos;s kind of obsessed with death .
he actually volunteers to deliver flowers
to the westport cemetery .
hey , milton !
fredrick osborn . who &apos;s he ?
our next victim .
help if i could . don &apos;t have any change .
you don &apos;t remember me , do you ?
i &apos;m sorry . uh ...
patient 4 @-@ 2 @-@ 1,
male , presenting with diabetes .
take off your hat .
raise your right hand .
wait . now put your left hand here .
take off your hat !
what are you doing ?
shh , shh , shh . watch -- the hat .
raise your right hand .
will you get rid of that hat ?
raise your right hand .
unlike someone who shall remain nameless , we waited for you .
shall we get started ?
i get a phone call . they tell me where to go , and i go .
who tells you ?
different people . it &apos;s never the same person twice .
jolene parker ?
i &apos;m telling you that i don &apos;t know any names .
my husband hides a key in the house .
what &apos;s it for -- a safe deposit box ?
a storage unit ?
it &apos;s your husband .
tell me about tom .
i don &apos;t know his real name .
he &apos;s got a brother in chicago .
i &apos;ve heard him talk about a woman , niki .
niki ? is that some woman he sees ?
do you think we sit around and we chat about it ?
there &apos;s a reason that his cover is that we &apos;re estranged
and our parents are dead .
there &apos;s a reason that there are no people in his life --
because none of it is real .
we were supposed to meet . he wants to talk about you .
he knows where i &apos;m staying .
it &apos;s only a matter of time before he &apos;s here .
we got to get out of here .
where the hell is keen ?
ressler said she had some personal business .
where are we on this next target -- osborn ?
have we located him ?
uh , units are at osborn &apos;s house .
wife and co @-@ workers can &apos;t reach him .
we found his car at a parking structure
near the hospital where he works .
i &apos;ve been questioning ian wright .
i think i found something .
bobbit &apos;s m.o. has shifted .
none of his other victims were connected ,
all murders for hire .
but the last three --
they &apos;re different , personal .
look at this . excuse me .
15 years ago , dr. fredrick osborn chaired
the department of endocrinology at city memorial .
he supervised a clinical trial seeking approval
for a dd4 classification drug to treat type 2 diabetes .
the early safety trials were funded
by a vermont venture capitalist named ian wright
and fast @-@ tracked through the fda approval process
by a lobbyist for the pharmaceutical industry
named bennett cochran .
and mitchell ?
15 years ago ,
she was osborn &apos;s research assistant .
she reviewed applicants for the clinical trial ,
personally identified participants .
including milton bobbit .
bobbit was patient zero .
everything &apos;s fine .
yeah ? then why didn &apos;t you pick up ?
there &apos;s a situation . i &apos;m handling it .
i just need time .
time for what ?
what are you -- my wife , tom ?
listen up . i just need ...
two hours .
i &apos;ll explain everything then .
just sit tight . don &apos;t panic .
easy for you to say .
i &apos;m the one who is accountable to berlin .
i &apos;m coming to your hotel now .
tell me about berlin .
berlin .
i can &apos;t .
what &apos;s in berlin ?
is the bank in berlin ?
christopher ...
who &apos;s in berlin ?
dembe , we &apos;re moving the conversation elsewhere .
wipe down the room .
tell me about the building .
the south elevator has no cameras .
empties into the basement .
two doors past the mechanical room lead to the alleyway .
okay , then .
what now ?
what are you doing ?
putting on my coat .
a man just jumped through the window .
there &apos;s a body on the sidewalk .
yes . and your husband , the police ,
and all the king &apos;s men will be here soon .
if you care to stick around and explain , feel free .
but i , for one , will not be in attendance .
dembe , i &apos;ll get her downstairs .
after you &apos;re finished , grab the pretzels .
every morning , when i wake up , i read the obituaries .
every aspect of death
fascinates me .
i don &apos;t want to die .
i &apos;ve done everything in my power not to --
western medicine , alternative therapies ,
pills ...
herbs .
but i have come to accept ...
that i ... will ... die .
oh , god . please , no .
no . no , no , no , no .
hey , doctor , i am not angry .
not anymore .
i was , but i &apos;m not now .
if anything , i want to thank you
for this ...
incredible journey you &apos;ve sent me on .
who would have ever thought that anything good
would come of what you did to me ?
metro still has no sign of osborn .
uh , no activity on the cayman account .
the man didn &apos;t just quit .
someone is paying him to do this .
or maybe they &apos;re not .
maybe there &apos;s no activity on the cayman account
because he wants to do the last one himself .
what if bobbit is terminally ill ?
his last murder / suicide .
what else do we know about this guy ,
about -- about his life ?
who is he ?
nobody . single .
he has no family or friends to speak of .
he cares about something .
westport --
it &apos;s the cemetery where he volunteers .
well , maybe that &apos;s where he wants to go and die .
before you made me sick , i had no purpose in life --
helped no one ...
left no mark .
thanks to you , i was transformed .
i no longer see death as a burden ,
but an opportunity ...
to take the rejects that nobody cares about
and give them tremendous power .
and as a result ,
hundreds of widows , orphans , broken families --
they &apos;re being taken care of .
their houses are being paid for ,
their education .
i put food on their table .
if i have helped you ...
why are you doing this to me ?
because the good things i have done
don &apos;t justify the terrible things you &apos;ve done .
negotiator &apos;s en route .
we have snipers in place .
no .
he &apos;s not gonna let us take him , and the man has a death wish .
how do you plan on recovering the hostage ?
what -- what are you doing ?
ressler .
hold your fire . hold your fire . hold your fire .
stop !
not -- not one more step further .
don &apos;t come any closer !
i swear to god --
you take one more step !
stay calm , mr. bobbit .
fredrick osborn ...
you &apos;re under arrest .
what ?
you have the right to remain silent .
anything you say can and will be used against you .
what is happening ? !
you &apos;re under arrest for evidence tampering ,
for murder in the furtherance
of a corrupt criminal enterprise .
you can &apos;t arrest me .
we know about the clinical trials ,
the people who died .
what about him ? you should arrest him .
i &apos;m not leaving .
i don &apos;t think milton has any intention
of being arrested today .
