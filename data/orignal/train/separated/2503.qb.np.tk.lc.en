第二十三季 第十集
你懂得
为我们从未举办过的奥运会而建
next .
finally . the only thing i wait in lines this long for
are slightly better cell phones .
why do we even have to go to this stupid wedding ?
cousin kathy invited us
so our feelings wouldn &apos;t be hurt .
and we &apos;re going so her feelings won &apos;t be hurt .
i just don &apos;t understand the world of grown @-@ ups .
sorry , sir , your bag is two pounds over the limit .
are you sure everything inside is essential ?
absolutely .
let me just redistribute our thingies
amongst our various bags .
high school yearbooks ...
i told you not to pack them !
don &apos;t argue in front of the airport line .
strangers are judging our marriage !
lisa , do you really need all these
kurt vonnegut novels ?
they self @-@ reference each other .
marge , do we really need all these feminine products ?
that &apos;s toothpaste !
yes , but i never use that kind of toothpaste !
why don &apos;t you put one of those weights in that bag
and put the other one in that bag ?
try to catch one on your tongue .
we &apos;re not with him .
《 猫的摇篮 》
we &apos;ll need to have a special agent check this out .
you &apos;re clear .
now i have to change the nipple .
true patriots breastfeed .
sir , you &apos;ve been selected for a pat @-@ down .
can you focus on my shoulders ?
that &apos;s where i carry my stress .
now , if i fart , that &apos;s &apos; cause i &apos;m so relaxed .
sir , there isn &apos;t enough room .
yes , there is !
welcome to flight 55
to bozeman , montana by way of miami .
due to an unforeseen jailbreak in new south wales ,
our takeoff is going to be just a little bit delayed .
so , we &apos;re going to be turning off the air ,
but ethnic people are permitted to open
and eat their home @-@ cooked food .
what the ... ?
crazy food indeed , my friend .
good news , folks .
we &apos;ve been cleared to taxi back to the terminal .
you still can &apos;t get off ,
but you will be able to look through the window
and see other people walking around and making fun of us .
no word on takeoff .
sir , return to your seat .
but i have to go to the bathroom .
you should have thought of that
before you drank the fluids you need to live .
那你所搭乘的航空公司不是本集所说的
don &apos;t tread on pee !
we probably have rights !
yeah !
airlines don &apos;t treat people like people anymore .
you make us beg for a filthy pillow
that a barnyard rat
wouldn &apos;t curl up and die in .
and watch pre @-@ taped messages
that make crashing look like fun !
never putting me next to a pretty girl .
we &apos;re going to need the air marshal .
now you &apos;ve done it !
i need backup !
come on , ladies .
you &apos;re all deputies now .
look , all i want is what everybody wants ,
preferential treatment .
you can check my carry @-@ on ,
but you can &apos;t check my spirit .
and why is there moisture between the windows ?
and don &apos;t wake me up to land .
just land !
i regret nothing !
except this part .
this is the last airline that would take us .
looks like we &apos;re back to traveling on tramp steamers and produce trucks .
i call shotgun !
it &apos;s too early to call shotgun .
it &apos;s never too early to call shotgun .
no one &apos;s shotgun !
now , be quiet .
i &apos;m still going to make my flight , right ?
&apos;cause , if not ,
you have to put me up in a first @-@ class hotel .
that &apos;s how it works . i ...
&quot; fatso goes nutso . &quot;
and post to youtube with the following key words :
&quot; fat , &quot; &quot; stupid , &quot; &quot; classic simpsons , &quot;
and just to be safe ,
&quot; baby rides kitten rides penguin . &quot;
perfect .
you can check my carry @-@ on ,
but you can &apos;t check my spirit .
and why is there moisture between the windows ?
and don &apos;t wake me up to land .
just land !
a six @-@ pack of duff , please .
oh , yes , mr. homer .
what gave me away ?
well , the hot dogs spin counterclockwise in fear ,
whenever you are near , sir .
uh , why are you in disguise ?
because of that dumb viral video with 150 million hits ,
i can &apos;t go out in public .
hey , it &apos;s the guy from the plane .
hey , way to go !
what ?
you said what we all think ,
but don &apos;t have the bones to say .
when i heard homer speak ,
i no longer felt small .
they love me .
the quiet homer simpson that kept it all bottled up inside
is dead .
this is the birth of homer simpson , blowhard .
i &apos;m on the roll of my life .
give me a scratcher .
give me another one .
almost a winner .
head butt with nash castor .
i &apos;m nash castor .
coming up , we butt heads with ron paul , rand paul ,
兰德 · 保罗 美国茶党人士
paul ryan and mitt &quot; the wonder &quot; romney .
米特 · 罗姆尼 美国共和党人 马萨诸塞州州长
but first , we &apos;re here with this guy
my kid said was a thing : homer simpson .
whoo @-@ hoo ! i &apos;m famous again !
yes , your video has been mashed @-@ up ,
auto @-@ tuned , jimmy falloned ,
philippine prisonered ,
and occasionally even watched .
but can you save america from its last savior ?
adriatica veljohnson .
nash ,
in this kicked @-@ in @-@ the @-@ teeth world ,
what we don &apos;t need is another blustering bloat bag ,
who claims to speak for bubba and britney spray @-@ cheese .
that &apos;s really smart .
that &apos;s like something i would say .
precisely , nash .
that &apos;s a great point , adriatica .
well , if i could explain myself ...
head butt !
we &apos;ll be right back after this .
come here , you .
homie , you can win this argument .
just rant and rave like you do to the tv during sports .
yes . yes . got it !
uh , five seconds to air .
and we &apos;re back with homer simpson ,
who &apos;s about to become a soggy pamper
flung to the side of history &apos;s freeway in three , two ...
not so fast !
now , i may not be some mani @-@ pedied tv blowhard ,
but i do speak for the common man ,
who does his lousy job ,
goes to church twice a year
and watches women &apos;s tennis
&apos;cause he likes to hear them grunt .
i bet chuck the cameraman and steve the sound guy
know where i &apos;m coming from .
yeah , that &apos;s what i &apos;m talking about .
those real people out there
who buy their coffee from the mini @-@ mart
and grab enough sugar packs for a week .
honest , hardworking , sugar @-@ stealing americans !
cut .
nash , i &apos;m scared .
find me a rich husband-- quick !
dad , you out @-@ talked the talking heads .
from now on , when someone asks me ,
i &apos;m going to say you are my father .
aw , son .
now i regret bad @-@ mouthing you to that girl you liked .
homer , the way you just demolished
our number @-@ one on @-@ air personality was ...
fantastic !
you are the kind of ill @-@ informed gasbag
this network cannot get enough of .
we only have 11 now .
not to mention our liberal straw man .
* oh , the plain and simple facts is *
* i &apos;d love to raise your taxes *
* and make your children gay ... *
but what we don &apos;t have is someone
who speaks to the average american .
your flyover franks , your dirt @-@ bike daryls .
how can you refer to your audience that way ?
well , what you do is take a derogatory term
and think of other words that start with the same letter .
homer , you &apos;re getting your own show .
finally .
but i want to do it my way :
classy and sophisticated .
welcome to gut check with homer simpson !
where the truth is served with a side of ... in your face .
i am homer simpson .
america &apos;s latest teller of truth with a book deal on the side .
audio book read by lenny .
i &apos;m not just another loudmouth .
i &apos;m a loudmouth who says things you &apos;re afraid to say ,
but not racist things !
let &apos;s go to the map .
zoomy , zoomy , zoomy .
dateline : nebraska .
a high school principal has decided
that football is too dangerous ,
so he &apos;s replacing it with ... soccer .
are you ready for irish announcers
with lyrical accents ?
&quot; oh , that &apos;s a lovely touch .
oh , such a beautiful form . &quot;
if we lose football ,
we lose the blitz , cheerleaders ,
rudys , ochocincos ,
something for fat kids to play .
ochocincos .
oh , yeah , that &apos;s right .
it &apos;s already happening , people .
hoard your toilet paper .
shoot the mailman !
shoot the mailman .
is it a little weird how much he cries ?
no way . when a guy who loves america cries ,
it makes him super straight .
this is going so great .
i &apos;m already a halloween mask !
that &apos;s not you .
they just painted shrek yellow .
it &apos;s still a great honor .
dad , i &apos;m glad your show is successful ,
but i have to ask you : what &apos;s with the crying ?
great question .
i know you children have never seen your father cry before .
marge , do we have any more gravy ?
no , we &apos;re out .
why ?
oh , why ? !
homie , i &apos;m glad you &apos;re passionate ,
i just hope you &apos;re not riling people up with your show .
oh , marge , don &apos;t worry .
people know i &apos;m doing a character ,
like stephen colbert or newt gingrich .
纽特 · 金瑞契 美国前白宫发言人
welcome back to gut check .
i have something very , very pro @-@ american to share with you .
come with me .
death to america !
i mean , over here .
you all know i &apos;m a big fan of american meat .
although , sometimes you got to cut off some of the gristle .
take that , centers of art and commerce !
and this country has something extra that makes our meat
the juiciest , most melt @-@ in @-@ your @-@ mouth ,
stay @-@ in @-@ your @-@ heart meat in the world .
that &apos;s right , i &apos;m talking about the gravy of freedom .
when march madness spills into april ,
that &apos;s the gravy .
when someone messes with you ,
and you invade the country that did it plus another one ,
that &apos;s the gravy .
when you stick your flag in the moon
and say &quot; now we &apos;re done trying , &quot;
that &apos;s the gravy !
so get on the boat .
the gravy boat !
good night and good gravy .
great show , people .
great show .
not a big deal , but next time ,
can we use real gravy instead of brown paint ?
not a big deal .
so , what &apos;s this with the gravy boat ?
just an innocuous little symbol ,
like a smiley face or like an i.o.u.
you know , symbols can often rile people up .
the swastika , the new york yankees logo .
don &apos;t worry , sweetie .
i think i know how to whip up an audience
just short of a frenzy .
why did i make this a loss leader ?
the gravy boat movement is spreading across the nation
like a rumor about some kid and someone &apos;s mom
hooking up at a high school .
with the presidential primaries coming up
and an entrenched incumbent in office ,
republican leaders have no choice but to court
this movement &apos;s inglorious baster , homer simpson .
marge , i &apos;m going to meet with the republican establishment
and pick their nominee .
if there &apos;s sandwiches there , you want me to bring some back ?
speaking for lisa and me ,
we &apos;re not really 110 % behind you anymore .
then what percent above 100 are you behind me ?
um , none .
only 100 % ? !
homie , i love you ,
and i &apos;m glad we &apos;re finally using our wedding china ,
but when you &apos;re helping to pick
the next leader of the free world ...
dad , you shouldn &apos;t do this .
it &apos;s not fair how much influence you have .
now , lisa , i &apos;m an entertainer .
and you can &apos;t entertain and inform at the same time .
and if you &apos;re access hollywood , you do neither .
要么把你们的钱都赢光
now , they &apos;re all excellent choices ,
so simply pick the white male candidate you prefer
and we &apos;ll elect him .
i don &apos;t know .
can &apos;t we get chris christie to run ?
i don &apos;t think so .
save me , obamacare !
yeah , maybe i &apos;ll vote democrat .
the great thing is , when they get in ,
they act like republicans .
no one &apos;s voting democrat while i can still draw a bow .
ted nugent .
i made love on my honeymoon to your sweet music .
you &apos;re my man !
you &apos;re endorsing ted nugent for president ?
he &apos;s a right @-@ wing rock star who likes everything i hate !
could there be anyone awesomer ?
who &apos;s hungry for elk ?
my daughter &apos;s a vegetarian .
that &apos;s all right , she can munch on an antler .
antlers ain &apos;t meat .
i thought i smelled death @-@ a @-@ diddly .
what is that , an eight @-@ pointer ?
from the looks of that moustache ,
i &apos;m guessing you &apos;re a tenured professor
at the people &apos;s republic of berkeley .
hey , the only left @-@ wing thing about me is the way i write .
oh , that &apos;s just fine ,
as long as you &apos;re not a mormon .
dad , you cannot endorse ted nugent .
i mean , sure , we all love his music ...
oh , yeah . no question about it .
i love that guy . we listen to it .
but he &apos;s out of his mind !
he can &apos;t run for president !
i bagged me a fat little badger .
please , kind sir , have pity .
all i hear is &quot; chitter @-@ chitter . &quot;
arise , homer simpson !
huh ? who &apos;s there ?
mozart !
i am james madison , sir .
fourth president of these united states .
now , come , and i shall teach you of democracy .
can we get some pizza on the way ?
everything &apos;s closed .
they sell some at the gas station .
i don &apos;t want gas station pizza .
so , how come your picture &apos;s not on money ?
actually , i &apos;m on the $ 5,000 bill .
do you give them out for fans ?
&apos;cause i &apos;m a fan .
i want to show you something .
what &apos;s this ?
some kind of bicentennial lemon party ?
these are the framers of the constitution , homer .
this great nation is built upon the hard work of ,
well , as you would say , nerds .
nerds !
you want i should mess them up ?
i want you should not mess !
you are an embarrassment to the aristocratic slaveholders
who forged this mighty nation .
but gravy is the freedom where ...
silence !
founding fathers , to me !
&quot; congress shall have the power to lay and collect taxes &quot; ? !
&quot; no new states shall be formed
&quot; or erected within the jurisdiction
of any other state &quot; ? !
no , no , john hancock .
i don &apos;t need insurance .
sam adams , i &apos;m sorry i made fun of your winter ale .
homie , wake up .
it was all a dream .
oh , marge , oscar madison came to me
and told me that politics are serious and important !
lisa , you were right !
i &apos;m not going to endorse anybody for anything .
oh , dad !
i &apos;m so glad you &apos;ve heard the voice of reason .
yes , the will of the people should not be subverted
by demagogues who-- hey , what &apos;s this ?
&quot; springfield colonial village &quot; ?
用于生日宴会 校外考察旅行 造假梦
what the ... ?
you faked it !
lisa , how could you ?
it wasn &apos;t just her , homie .
it was all of us .
i did it just to mess with your mind .
that &apos;s what a play within a play is for !
no strangling on school days !
well , if there &apos;s one thing i don &apos;t like being taught ,
it &apos;s a lesson !
i &apos;m so mad .
not only will i endorse ted nugent ,
but i will call for an end to the direct election of senators !
dad , no !
really ? that made sense ?
then i &apos;m definitely doing it .
选举特辑
folks , because i love democracy so much ,
i command you to vote for this man
whom i alone have selected as your next president .
now to baptize his candidacy with my tears .
the words &quot; strutting stadium rocker &quot; are overused these days ,
but when i first met ted nugent ...
my emotions were so powerful .
come on , hurry up and cry so i can get elected
and open up the san diego zoo for big game hunting .
it &apos;s not working . but why ?
maybe because , deep down ,
you know you don &apos;t believe in what you &apos;re doing .
oh , my god , she &apos;s right .
my lips will say anything ,
but my eyes know the truth !
my ears are keeping their mouth shut .
my fellow americans , i am full of crap .
i knew you were , dad .
i always knew !
well , for one brief , glorious moment ,
i was almost president ,
sort of , not really .
now , let me just play a sweet song that i &apos;ll never hear .
* hail to me *
* i &apos;m the presidential gonzo *
* hunt with a bow &apos; cause it &apos;s silent like the night *
* eat mooses raw so their souls go into my soul *
* i &apos;ll move the white house to kalamazoo . *
* there is a new national anthem that is sweeping the land *
* and it was written by me *
* and it popped into my head *
* while i was washing my dog *
* suck on that , francis scott key *
* oh , i got a good song fever *
* something , something fever *
sing it , homer !
* i got this song fever *
* we got america fever *
* we got america fever *
* u.s. of a ! *
* u.s. of a. *
great song , ted !
when &apos;s our next gig ?
are we going to new york or ... ?
