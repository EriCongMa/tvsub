hey .
hi .
why are you wearing my apron ?
i &apos;m making cookies for erica .

it &apos;s unbelievable . she was supposed to meet me a half @-@ hour ago with emma .
hey !
hey !
these are for erica !
she &apos;s gonna eat all those cookies ?
well , i want the baby to come out all cute and fat !
so why is erica coming to visit ?
we wanna get to know her better .
she &apos;s never been to new york , so she wants to see the tourist spots :
statue of liberty , empire state building .
there &apos;s always so many people , and they &apos;re being corralled like cattle .
and , you know , there &apos;s always some idiot who goes , &quot; moo . &quot;
well , if it annoys you so much , then why do you do it ?
you should take her to a museum .
oh , please .
so i can hear chandler say over and over again :
&quot; you call this art ? i could make that . &quot;
it was a tower of sponges .
oh , hi . hi . thanks for showing up 30 minutes late .
no , i &apos;m sure you have a great excuse . what was it , a hair appointment ?
a mani @-@ pedi ? was there a sale at barneys ?
my father had a heart attack .
while i was at barneys .
oh , my god , rach .
honey ?
i &apos;m so sorry .
is he okay ?
yeah , he &apos;s gonna be fine , but he &apos;s heavily sedated .
okay , i &apos;m gonna go to long island with you .
i mean , you can &apos;t be alone right now .
no , come on , i &apos;m totally okay .
i don &apos;t need you to come .
i can totally handle this on my own .
still , still , let me come for me .
okay . if you really need to .
i bet someone could use one of monica &apos;s freshly baked cookies .
oh , i really could .
all right , it seems pretty simple .
your first line is , &quot; my name is claude . &quot;
so just repeat after me .
well , let &apos;s try it again .
okay .
it &apos;s not ..
quite what i &apos;m saying .
really ? sounds exactly the same to me .
it does , really ?
yeah .
let &apos;s just try it again .
okay .
really listen .
got it .
hey , you guys !
hi .
i want you to meet someone really special .
phoebe , this is erica . and this is the baby !
joey , erica , baby .
hi .
everyone , erica ! baby !
monica . calm . self .
hey , sit down .
thank you .
it &apos;s really nice to meet you guys . i can &apos;t believe i &apos;m here .
well , welcome to new york city , or should i say :
why would you say that ?
okay . what are you gonna be doing today ?
well , i wanna see everything ! times square , coney island , rockefeller center .
you should walk to the top of the statue of liberty .
oh , yeah , let &apos;s do that .
great .
this baby better be really good .
hi . excuse me , i &apos;m here to see my father . my name is rachel green .
and i &apos;m dr. ross geller .
ross , please , this is a hospital .
that actually means something here .
so can we please go in ?
absolutely .
rach , i think i &apos;m gonna wait out here ..
because my throat is feeling a little scratchy . i don &apos;t wanna infect him .
ross , please . don &apos;t be so scared of him .
i am not scared of him . i &apos;m really sick .
he &apos;s under sedation , so he &apos;s out .
i &apos;m feeling better .
oh , my god .
that ear and nose hair trimmer i got him was just money down the drain , huh ?
ms. green ? your father &apos;s doctor &apos;s on the phone if you &apos;d like to speak to him .
oh , great . are you gonna be okay ?
he &apos;s unconscious . we &apos;ll be just fine .
okay .
did the tv wake you ?
no .
when you put your feet up on my bed , you tugged on my catheter .
what are you doing here , geller ?
well , i came with rachel , who should be back any second .
so , what &apos;s new ?
oh , i had a little heart attack .
right . is it painful ?
what , the heart attack or sitting here talking to you ?
let &apos;s see if we can get that rachel back in here .
so , what &apos;s new with you ? knocked up any more of my daughters lately ?
nope . just the one . rach !
daddy , hi . you &apos;re awake .
how are you ?
i &apos;m okay .
by the way , ross has been of great comfort .
they want to keep you here for a couple more nights .
i know .
but i &apos;m gonna go home and get a bunch of your stuff ..
so that you &apos;re really comfortable .
oh , thank you , sweetheart .
it &apos;s pretty ironic , huh ?
you being a heart surgeon , and you had a heart attack .
it &apos;d be like if i was eaten by an allosaurus .
i &apos;m gonna wait outside .
&quot; he &apos;s pretty much out . &quot;
no !
okay , maybe if we just break it down .
okay , let &apos;s try it one syllable at a time . okay , so repeat after me .
great ! okay , faster .
okay , it &apos;s too hard . i can &apos;t teach you .
what are you doing ?
i have to go before i put your head through a wall .
don &apos;t go , i need you ! my audition is tomorrow !
hey . i was gonna make us some dinner ..
but all i found in your dad &apos;s fridge was bacon and heavy cream .
i think we solved the mystery of the heart attack .
did you call your parents ?
oh , yeah . emma &apos;s doing great .
oh , good .
what ?
i just can &apos;t believe ..
i &apos;m in rachel green &apos;s room .
you &apos;ve been in my room before .
yeah , sure , right .
like i &apos;d ever be in rachel green &apos;s room .
okay , i gotta tell you , it &apos;s really weird when you use my whole name .
sorry .
you okay ?
yeah .
yeah , you had a rough day .
yeah .
it &apos;s just so weird seeing him like that , you know ? i mean , he &apos;s a doctor .
you don &apos;t expect doctors to get sick .
but we do .
he &apos;s gonna be okay , rach .
i don &apos;t want him to wake up alone . i should go to the hospital .
what ? no , no . hey , hey , look .
what ?
they gave him a lot of medication .
he wouldn &apos;t even know if you were there .
we &apos;ll go see him first thing in the morning .
really ? i shouldn &apos;t feel guilty ?
no .. god , hey .
rach , you &apos;ve been an amazing daughter , okay ?
right now you need to get some rest .
okay , maybe you &apos;re right .
good night .
wait , wait , wait .
would you stay here with me for a little while ?
sure .
okay .
thank you for coming with me today .
oh , of course .
rachel green is very happy you &apos;re in her room .
me too . come here .
i just don &apos;t wanna be alone tonight .
okay , well , i can maybe grab a sleeping bag or ..
no , rach !
i &apos;m sorry , i just don &apos;t think this is a good idea .
well , we won &apos;t know that until we do it , will we ?
look ..
you are upset about your father , and you &apos;re feeling vulnerable ..
and i just don &apos;t feel it would be right .
i feel like i &apos;d be , you know , taking advantage of you .
what .. ? taking advantage ? i am giving you the advantage . enjoy !
look , i &apos;m sure it would be great ..
but i think one of us has to be thinking clearly .
so i &apos;m gonna go .
okay .
i &apos;ll see you in the morning .
i haven &apos;t had sex in four months . i should get a medal for that !
thanks so much for taking me to all those places . i had a great time .
i &apos;m glad . listen , i wanna apologize about chandler , though .
i just did not see this coming .
new york is awesome !
what is with you ?
i &apos;ve been to these places before ..
but i &apos;ve never really seen them .
yeah , you miss a lot when you &apos;re mooing .
let &apos;s go to a broadway show . cats !
i think we &apos;ve done enough .
honey , these are actors dressed like cats who sing like people .
i mean , come on !
thank you for showing me around .
oh , it was our pleasure .
we &apos;re so much enjoying getting to know you .
well , if there &apos;s anything else you wanna know ..
okay .
can we ask you some questions about the father ?
oh , sure . yeah .
well , he was my high @-@ school boyfriend , captain of the football team , really cute .
got a scholarship and went to college .
that &apos;s great .
yeah , it &apos;s almost definitely him .
how &apos;s that , now ?
well , there &apos;s a chance it &apos;s another guy .
i mean , i &apos;ve only ever been with two guys ..
but they sort of overlapped .
so , what does the other guy do ?
does he go to college too ?
no , he &apos;s in prison .
was he falsely accused of something ?
no .
he killed his father with a shovel .
other than that , he &apos;s a great guy .
i &apos;ll bet his dad doesn &apos;t think so .
are you awake ?
of course i &apos;m awake .
assume from now on that i &apos;m always awake .
all right , we don &apos;t know that it &apos;s him . i mean , it could be the football guy .
honey , it &apos;s us . of course it &apos;s the shovel killer .
well , all right , let &apos;s say that it is him .
would we not want the baby ? no .
would we treat him any differently ?
i &apos;d keep an eye on him .
we have to find out who the father is .
how ?
i don &apos;t know .
they have tests for these things , right ?
yes , but maybe we &apos;re just overreacting .
easy for you to say . he &apos;s a father killer .
he probably loves his mommy .
he &apos;s probably got a tattoo that says &quot; mom &quot; on his shovel @-@ wielding arm .
we &apos;ll now count from one to five .
good job .
thank you .
hey .
hey , joey .
listen , i feel really badly about yesterday , and i thought about it a lot .
no , i was too impatient . so let &apos;s try it again .
that &apos;s okay . i don &apos;t need your help .
i worked on it myself , and i gotta say i am pretty good .
really , can i hear some of it ?
sure , sure .
okay .
see ?
you , you &apos;re not ..
you &apos;re not .. you &apos;re ..
again , you &apos;re not speaking french !
oh , well , i think i am . yeah , and i think i &apos;m definitely gonna get the part .
how could you possibly think that ?
the guy on the tape said i was doing a good job !
hey , rach , can you grab me a cup of coffee ?
sure .
you &apos;ve been quiet all morning . is everything okay ?
you sure you &apos;re all right ?
yep .
okay .
well , i &apos;m gonna go grab us some breakfast .
fyi .
there it is .
in the future ..
when a girl asks for some ill @-@ advised sympathy sex , just do it .
wait , wait , you &apos;re mad at me about last night ?
i was just trying to do the right thing .
really ?
if you had done the right thing ..
i wouldn &apos;t have woken up feeling stupid and embarrassed .
i would &apos;ve woken up feeling comforted and satisfied .
well ..
oh , stop that !
i can &apos;t believe this . i was just being a good guy .
i treated you with respect and understanding .
oh , that is so hot .
hey , i was looking out for you .
oh , really ? well , you know what ? i am a big girl .
i don &apos;t need someone telling me what is best for me .
i gotta say , i &apos;ve not had sex a lot of times before . this is the worst ever !
oh , really ? really ? well , it wasn &apos;t very good for me either .
okay , you know .. ? hey , hey , you know what ?
to avoid this little thing in the future ..
let &apos;s just say you and me ? never having sex again .
what ?
that &apos;s right ! sex is off the table !
i am never having sex with you again !
dr. green , are you feeling better ?
hey . how was lunch ?
we had a good time .
by the way , i wanted to ask you something .
it would really mean a lot to me if the baby was a boy ..
that you name him after my father ..
jiminy billy bob .
oh , really ?
no !
you were right . that was fun .
i &apos;m gonna go finish packing .
so is she gonna take the test ?
no , she doesn &apos;t have to .
i found out who the father is .
oh , god .
it &apos;s shovely joe , isn &apos;t it ?
no , it &apos;s not .
how do you know ?
erica didn &apos;t pay attention in sex ed class ..
because the things she did with that prison guy ?
it &apos;d be pretty hard to make a baby that way .
oh , god , what was it ? the thing we hardly ever do , or the thing we never do ?
the thing we never do .
shovely joe .
whenever you &apos;re ready , joey .
right .
i &apos;m sorry , what &apos;s going on ?
dude , come on , french it up .
joey , do you speak french ?
that &apos;s not french .
neither is that .
you know what ? i think this audition is over .
excuse me ?
i am regine phalange .
i was passing by when i heard this man speaking ..
the regional dialect of my french town of estee lauder .
you really think this man is speaking french ?
okey
i &apos;lltell you the truth
he &apos;s my little brother
he &apos;s a little retarded
would you please just humor him ?
good job , little buddy .
that was some really good french .
but i think we &apos;re gonna go with someone else for the part .
all right , but my french was good ?
it was great .
see ?
thanks , goodbye
emma &apos;s down for the night .
oh , good .
so i guess i &apos;m gonna take off .
okay .
hey , listen , just before you go ..
i just wanna say thank you for coming with me .
oh , no problem .
and also , you know , i ..
i was thinking about what you said , you know , about the whole sex thing ..
probably not a great idea to go down that road again .
thank you . i &apos;m glad you agree .
it &apos;s a shame , though . when we did it , it was pretty good .
yeah .
yeah , that &apos;s true .
hey , do you remember that one really great time ?
oh , yeah !
you know ?
it was valentine &apos;s day .
it was your birthday .
oh , yeah .
oh , yeah .
well , i guess that &apos;s all in the past now .
not even one more time .
not even once .
no matter how much we want it .
even if we want it ..
really bad .
that &apos;s what we decided .
right .
it &apos;s kind of hard , though . you know ?
yeah .
when two people have a connection , you know , that &apos;s ..
just seems like ..
such a ..
waste .
i hate waste .
ross ?
yes ?
just so you know ..
with us ..
it &apos;s never off the table .
damn it , it &apos;s never off the table .
okay , can you really tap @-@ dance ?
no .
it &apos;s off the resume .
archery ?
no .
horseback riding ?
would fall off a lot .
you can drink a gallon of milk in 10 seconds ?
that i can do .
come on , you can drink a gallon of milk in 10 seconds ?
all right , watch me .
okay , you time me , ready ?
ready , go !
