oh , these people are real desert @-@ y .
i don &apos;t think this is the kind of place
where you &apos;re gonna want to s ...
somebody watch that .
i must say , this is not my favorite
sort of white people in here .
me neither . my favorite kind
of white people are redheads with high socks .
male or female .
um , remember earlier , when you took my phone
and it went &quot; ding &quot; ?
wait a minute .
there &apos;s a desert flower over there
who needs a little watering .
what &apos;s schmidt doing ?
oh , he &apos;s not even looking at the buttons .
hey , what &apos;s going on ?
unplug it . unplug the whole thing .
good thing that &apos;s over .
we can come back from this . buy everybody in here a drink .
that &apos;s a cool move . that &apos;s a rat pack move .

um , uh , a beer ? a bock , maybe ?
you &apos;ve got some amber in @-@ in your necklace .
uh , maybe an amber bock .
nick ?
nick ?
i got to tell you , i love that vest .
desert fashion has a certain
functional sensuality that i really respond to .
i made it out of my dead rottweiler .
you dirty little rattlesnake .
you know , i &apos;ve got a picnic blanket
in my minivan , we could go ...
you know what ? if you &apos;re gonna be traveling in my minivan ,
you &apos;re gonna live by my rules .
now go over there and sit down .
you know , i &apos;m willing to bet ,
you got a big spider in your hair .
when i come back ,
i intend to find it .
i &apos;m not mad .
i &apos;m just incredibly disappointed in you .
five whiskeys , please .
coming up .
you &apos;re doing them all .
that &apos;s too much whiskey for my frame .
no , no , i know it seems like a lot ,
but binge drinking can be a fun
and safe way to engage with life .
this is one of your dear friend &apos;s
bachelor parties , you know ?
if you miss out on it now ,
you miss out on the memories forever , wally .
my name &apos;s winston , but you &apos;re absolutely correct , man .
i should not be sitting here , thinking about aly .
she &apos;s never going to go for a guy like me .
clearly living in a fantasy world .
i should be getting drunk with you guys
in this disgusting bar .
hear , hear . cheers to that .
oh , that is low quality whiskey .
yeah .
hey , barkeep .
let me get a whiskey on ice .
what ? what &apos;d i say ?
did he say something about ice ?
where are you boys from ?
i &apos;m from los angeles .
east side .
the ... more ... uh ... east ... east downtown .
big city boys trying to come to our desert
and freeze the little water we got left .
&apos;cause you &apos;re too soft for a hot whiskey .
no @-@ no one &apos;s bad mouthing hot whiskey .
hot whiskey was my first chat room name .
who wants a drink ?
i &apos;ll take a nice warm glass
of how about you stop coming over here and using our water
to hydrate your daisies over in l.a. ? !
okay , first of all , let me just say ,
i think we &apos;re all concerned
about the drought in california .
i haven &apos;t showered in six days .
oh , so you &apos;re saying you want to fight .
that &apos;s a huge leap in logic .
you want to fight ?
yeah .
i &apos;ll fight you and then i &apos;ll take a hot shower ,
you s @-@ sandy lizard man .
let &apos;s do this .
totally , totally , totally , totally , totally .
yeah , let &apos;s fight these guys , nick .
yeah , totally .
we &apos;re gonna fight these guys .
uh , but not indoors .
because real men fight outside .
yeah , just like real chili doesn &apos;t have beans .
what the hell you just say about beans ?
beans are nothing but soggy nuts .
what the hell are you saying about nuts ? !
nothing , it &apos;s a totally weird digression .
it &apos;s not what we &apos;re about .
we &apos;ll see you outside .
but first we got to go to the little boys &apos; room together .
yeah , we &apos;re gonna urinate and then we &apos;re gonna do this .
yeah .
uh , is there a key ? do i need a key to the restroom ?
ooh , god , i hope i get to kick somebody in the head .
what are you doing with that window ?
you letting a bee out ? that &apos;s dope , man .
n @-@ n @-@ n @-@ n @-@ n @-@ no . we &apos;re escaping .
we &apos;re not fighting those guys .
what ?
i thought you s @-@ said that
we &apos;re going to meet them outside ?
uh , yeah .
and they believed it . it &apos;s a great trick .
it &apos;s how the millers have never had to pay for a ham .
we &apos;re escaping ? how @-@ how is that butch , nick ?
enough with the butch stuff , schmidt .
you got to let this toby thing go .
if i freaked out every time somebody yelled at me , i ...
it &apos;s not because i got yelled at .
it &apos;s because i got yelled at in front of cece .
you know , i know she can handle herself ,
but i need to prove to myself that i can defend her
from the lunatic pagans of the world .
because if i can &apos;t ,
what kind of husband am i going to be ?
i understand if you don &apos;t want any part of this ,
but this is something i have to do .
for me .
okay . i &apos;m in .
if you got to do it , then i got your back .
there &apos;s two of them , there &apos;s two of us .
we can do this .
they got a lot of rings , schmidty .
we are so outnumbered . so outnumbered .
we &apos;re not going to win this fight .
that &apos;s a little boy over there .
where &apos;d that little boy come from ?
he just does that sometimes .
all right , i &apos;ll take the little boy .
i &apos;m gonna take the little boy .
i got the little boy .
you take everybody else .
i got the boy .
i &apos;m gonna go for the little boy .
you &apos;re not touching dirt boy .
don &apos;t touch dirt boy .
dirt boy touches you .
why did you not more forcefully talk me out of this ?
why is that little boy not in a day care ?
are we fighting or not ?
what are we gonna do ?
we gotta do something , schmidt .
schmidt ! schmidt ! schmidt !
what are you doing ?
i &apos;m being a man .
i &apos;m schmidt !
schmidt !
yeah , i &apos;m schmidt ! schmidt !
why does he keep saying his name ?
i &apos;m schmidt .
in case you &apos;re wondering what my n ...
... what my name is , it &apos;s schmidt .
schmidt !
this is nick ! nick ! schmidt !
you know what would be a good plan ?
you get a job at a raisin bran factory , right ?
you start stealing
all of the raisins , okay ? you follow ?
then you hydrate those raisins
to make them turn back into grapes ,
and you sell the grapes .
there &apos;s no overhead , and you make you a very rich man .
that &apos;s right , wilson .
you have surrendered to the night .
i &apos;m wilson .
schmidt ! yeah , i &apos;m schmidt !
my babies .
ain &apos;t nobody gonna touch my babies .
knuckle up !
yeah , i &apos;m feeling dangerous !

i don &apos;t deserve trucks .
i &apos;ll be the judge of that .
you deserve trucks .

i got hit with a geode .
some dude stuck his fingers in my mouth .
what is that ? is that like a desert power thing ?
when things started escalating , i just rolled up
into a little ball like an armadillo .
fellas , can i get real for a second ?
i was thinking about aly the entire time .
this is one of her barrettes .
you know , women use barrettes
to keep their hairs in different styles .
yeah .
but aly uses this to pin her hair up when she &apos;s on duty .
and i kept it .
that &apos;s how pathetic i am .
that &apos;s not pathetic .
it &apos;s lovely .
it reminds me of all my old lost loves .
yeah . cece .
or my ex .
she was a pill ,
but when she used to go to second base on me ,
she was like joe morgan .
you know , a lot of people don &apos;t know this ,
but , uh , aly &apos;s full name is alison .
i like to imagine that she was named after the song .
alison .
i know this world is killing you
alison .
my aim is true .
sorry i got us into this , nick .
i was useless out there .
i didn &apos;t even get one punch in .
that &apos;s not true . you hit me a little bit .
i got my ass whomped out there .
got whomped up and down the road .
what &apos;s whomp ?
like a whomp @-@ down .
oh , whooped ?
whomped .
are you talking about getting beat up ?
yes .
whooped .
i got this calendar bod ,
but it doesn &apos;t hold up in battle .
look , it &apos;s 2016 .
she &apos;s not looking for a strong husband .
that ... no , tha @-@ that &apos;s not what i was gonna ...
that &apos;s not where i was going with this .
i &apos;m getting married , nick .
how am i going to defend cece ?
she deserves the best husband in the world ,
and what if i don &apos;t have what it takes ?
of course you have what it takes to be a modern husband .
do you have what it takes to be a husband of the old world ?
god , no .
they would use you as a pelt .
today , you fought , kinda .
you &apos;re gonna make a great husband to cece .
how do you know ?
because i know .
because why ?
because .
look what happened here today . because why ?
beca ... ever since i &apos;ve known you , you &apos;ve been there .
okay , you &apos;re always there .
even when i don &apos;t want you there , you &apos;re there .
that &apos;s what a husband does .
you fight for me . that &apos;s what a husband does .
you care about what i eat .
that &apos;s what a husband does .
you &apos;ve cooked for me , even when i don &apos;t ask .
that &apos;s what a husband does .
when i pass out , you comb my hair so there &apos;s no knots in it .
that &apos;s what a husband does .
so , guess what .
you &apos;re gonna be a great husband to cece because
you &apos;re a great husband to me .
so that &apos;s how i know .
you &apos;re , you &apos;re like my husband .
you &apos;re like my wife , but ...
