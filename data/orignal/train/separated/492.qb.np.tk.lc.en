you ok ?
yeah , i &apos;m just really tired .
he had his meds an hour ago .
yeah , post @-@ op antibiotics .
carbenicillin ? no , that &apos;s not right .
i have a severe reaction to beta lactams .
that &apos;s not in your chart .
what are you doing ?
what are you doing ?
garcia ! he has a gun !
you saved my life .
hey , you &apos;re ok .
you &apos;re ok .
our father , who art in heaven ,
hallowed by thy name ,
thy kingdom come , the will be done ,
on earth as it is in heaven ,
give us this day our daily bread ,
and forgive us our trespasses
as we forgive those who trespass against us .
and lead us not into temptation ,
but deliver us from evil ,
for thine is the kingdom
and the power and the glory
forever and ever .
amen .
this is not fair .
you should just kill him !
she &apos;s right . why all the fanfare ? let him burn in hell .
just do it . kill him !
kill him ! kill him !
kill him ! kill him ! kill him !
kill him ! kill him ! kill him !
kill him ! kill him ! kill him ! kill him !
kill him ! kill him ! kill him ! kill him ...
no ! no , please ! no !
i &apos;ve been having nightmares all night , every night
about this , and i know you guys
deal with it , and i &apos;m not trying--
it &apos;s just that i can &apos;t just let it happen .
i--i can &apos;t-- i have to go . i have--
then you should .
you don &apos;t think i &apos;m certifiable ? you &apos;re not mad at me ?
no . i &apos;ll have kevin lynch cover ,
and you have a lot of vacation time .
thank you . thank you .
you are a terrific boss .
you &apos;re a terrific boss .
you &apos;re just terrific .
thank you . thank you . thank you . thank you .
so , what &apos;d he say ?
he said i should go to texas .
hotch would never say that .
ok . he said i have a lot of vacation days ,
which is kind of the same thing .
he said you were crazy , garcia , didn &apos;t he ?
he didn &apos;t , because i am not crazy .
going to see the man who almost killed you and reid
is way beyond crazy .
he needs to know that i never meant
for him to end up on death row .
greg baylor is a murderer .
he &apos;s there for a reason .
then lock him up for life , but killing him
doesn &apos;t bring any of the people that he killed back again ,
and it &apos;s bad karma for everyone .
i &apos;ve done everything i can think of .
i wrote to the governor on fbi stationery .
i called him 3 times . you said you had a
hook @-@ up with the prosecutor &apos;s office .
baby girl , he pled guilty ,
forfeiting a trial . he waived all appeals
and admitted to numerous other killings .
the governor is setting an example .
and greg baylor needs to know
that i never meant for this to happen .
so send him a letter .
i already did that . i can &apos;t totally explain it ,
but i have to go and see him .
please , i can &apos;t talk to sam about this . you have to have my back .
no . i don &apos;t have your back .
he is a murderer . he &apos;s scum .
he tried to kill you . wake up .
let me know when you &apos;re done washing his feet .
so where &apos;s garcia and morgan ?
are they finally having that love child ?
heard that .
busted .
uh , garcia &apos;s taking some personal time .
is everything ok ?
i hope it wasn &apos;t those burritos we had yesterday .
she &apos;s fine . kevin lynch will be presenting the case .
hiya . hi .
sorry .
where we going ?
seattle , washington .
over the past few weeks ,
two gentlemen between the ages of 35 and 40
have been killed , with with radically different m.o.s.
first victim , dan chen ,
was strangled and dropped off on the side of a road .
the second victim , joe hazley , was run over by a car .
the intimacy of strangulation suggests a personal attack ,
literally and figuratively ,
the need to kill in a hands @-@ on manner .
while crushing someone with a car
presents as distance and removal from the kill .
what makes you think they &apos;re connected ?
the victims &apos; cars were found about two miles from each other ,
and they have similar mutilation around their mouths .
and he crosses racial lines .
well , if you consider that and a similar geo @-@ profile ,
maybe we have two different killers .
we could be looking at a team .
a disorganized one .
or the unsub &apos;s just experimenting ,
trying to figure out how he or she likes to kill .
similar to herzog and shermantine .
二人共犯谋杀案四起 疑似谋杀案72起
so we need to get to seattle quickly .
if he &apos;s evolving , he could strike again soon .
abandon all hope , ye who enter here .
abandon all hope , ye who enter here .
where am i ?
what is this place ?
pl--
please .
please , i &apos;ll do--
i &apos;ll do whatever you want .
please !
abandon all hope , ye who enter here .
abandon all hope , ye who enter here .
abandon all hope ye who enter here .
abandon all hope ye who enter here .
abandon all hope ye who enter here !
&quot; the farther backward you can look ,
the farther forward you can see . &quot;
winston churchill .
all right , victimology . dan chen had two children ,
joe hazley was single .
the first guy was a doctor and the other was a contractor .
socially they wouldn &apos;t overlap .
well , they may have professionally .
one could have been a patient ,
and the doctor could have hired the contractor .
no , i already checked into that . they didn &apos;t know each other .
so they were victims of opportunity .
but why change from strangulation
to running over victims in a car ?
well , it seems impulsive ,
which implies he &apos;s young and inexperienced .
but he had to have the strength to pull this off ,
so that probably means he was older .
um , excuse me , agent hotchner .
what is it ?
a third victim , michael richmond ,
was just found about 4 miles
from where they found the last victim .
how was he killed ?
he drowned . they found his discarded body on a rural highway ,
and he had oral mutilation .
that &apos;s near the last victim &apos;s abduction site .
just as we thought , the unsub &apos;s moving quickly .
this could be a spree .
all right , when we land , dave , you and kate
go to the last abduction site .
morgan and reid to the m.e. ,
and jj and i will talk to the families .
hey , what &apos;s going on with penelope ?
reid , i &apos;ll talk to you more about
that when we &apos;re alone , all right ?
is she ok ? i mean , she isn &apos;t sick , is she ?
that really depends on your definition of sick .
goin &apos; to see your boo ?
no , not--
no boo .
girl , i know why you &apos;re goin &apos; up there
wearing some flower hose and not trying to get some .
it &apos;s complicated .
trust me .
you want to hear complicated , honey ?
my boo is my baby dad &apos;s ex .
ex @-@ girlfriend ?
no .
ex @-@ boyfriend .
damn . what &apos;s he in for ?
armed robbery . but he ain &apos;t killed nobody .
he just drove the car .
oh . ok .
but , you know , it &apos;s a good thing we &apos;re going up there today .
&apos;cause tomorrow they fryin &apos; somebody .
but don &apos;t trip .
the day after you can come back and see that boo .
who i know you &apos;re denying is really your boo .
no , he &apos;s--
you know , i &apos;m not one to ask the fbi for assistance ,
but this was strange .
we &apos;re here to help in any way we can .
the first two victims &apos; families should be here shortly .
have you interviewed the drowning victim &apos;s family ?
we have officers doing that now .
he was the father of two . poor kids .
we &apos;ll need to talk to his family .
of course . we &apos;ll set you guys up in here .
you have a suspect ?
we &apos;re putting together a profile .
shouldn &apos;t we hold a press conference ?
we don &apos;t want to tip our hand .
we also don &apos;t want this madman to go crazy .
unfortunately , we &apos;re a little past that .
we &apos;ll come up with a media strategy
once we have more information .
we &apos;ll see what we get from the family interviews .
all of the victims had different c.o.d.s.
strangulation ,
severe crush injuries ,
and finally , drowning .
the last victim &apos;s hands and legs were bound
before the unsub forcibly submerged him .
they all have contusions on their heads .
and it looks like he blitz attacks them or hits them
when they try to fight back .
there was no dna or trace evidence found .
you get the tox screen back ?
nothing out of the ordinary in their systems .
however , i did find some slash marks
on the roofs of their mouths .
slash marks ? we thought it was random mutilation .
what is it ?
it &apos;s not slashes . it look--
it looks like roman numerals .
what ?
look .
it &apos;s the number 3 .
joe hazley &apos;s body &apos;s downstairs .
we &apos;ll need to see it .
reid , what about this guy ?
it looks like roman numeral 5 .
so then we may not be looking at victims 1 , 2 , and 3 .
we &apos;re probably looking at 3 , 4 , and 5 .
which means there are two more bodies out there .
i &apos;ll have kevin look into past homicides in the area ,
see if any match the m.o.
1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 .
9 !
they ran him over in a car ?
a car ? who would do that ? why joe ?
does your brother have any enemies ?
not at all .
ok , um , has he had any run @-@ ins with colleagues or exes ?
joe wasn &apos;t like that .
he was a mediator , you know ?
the guy at the party who makes sure everyone &apos;s having fun .
if you needed $ 10 , he &apos;d give you 20 .
even with his little brother from that program ,
he treated him like blood .
so he volunteered as a big brother ?
yes .
he could be tough on jose .
but that kid went from getting cs to as thanks to joe .
how old is jose ?
14 .
when he finds out what happened ,
it &apos;s gonna kill him .
you get anything ?
no enemies . seemed loved .
yeah , same with dan chen .
his wife said he was a good father to the twin 13 @-@ year @-@ olds .
the boys said he was tough but fair .
that could be our connection .
joe hazley was mentoring a kid the same age
who he was also tough on .
mike richmond had a son about the same age , too .
they had an argument about an hour before he went missing .
maybe our unsub has something against strict paternal figures
with boys in that age group .
name .
penelope garcia .
i &apos;m here to see greg baylor .
you &apos;re not on the list . next .
wait , no . i &apos;m from the fbi .
i left a message .
oh , yeah . that garcia .
he said he didn &apos;t want to see you .
next .
no ! uh , i came here all the way from quantico .
he can &apos;t just not want to see me .
i have something i have to tell him .
he &apos;s on death row .
i understand where he is ,
and i also understand the constitution .
and mr. baylor still has rights ,
which he has decided to exercise .
next .
ok , ok .
uh ... can i leave him a note ?
you can try .
can i borrow your pen ?
over there .
yes , sir . yes , sir .
next !
so , this is where mike richmond was abducted .
this road is highly trafficked ,
but this stretch seems pretty empty .
our unsub probably followed him .
yes , so how did he lure them out of their vehicles ,
&apos;cause they &apos;d be on alert out here .
he bumps them as they cross the intersection ,
then they pull over , thinking they were in an accident .
like a bump and rob .
but this turned into a bump and abduct .
you know , i had a rapist once
who liked to bump and rape right there on the side of the road .
and no one saw ?
no , if they did , they kept going .
i &apos;m convinced most people don &apos;t pay attention these days .
if it doesn &apos;t happen on the phone , it doesn &apos;t exist .
i planned that for effect .
why don &apos;t you answer that ?
it &apos;s garcia . i don &apos;t know what to tell her , reid .
she &apos;s gone to see greg baylor before he gets executed .
go figure .
it &apos;s ptsd .
her nightmares are ptsd , reid .
she &apos;s taken this to a whole nother level .
you know garcia .
she carries a laptop , not a gun .
she can &apos;t even look at crime scene photos
without needing pictures of panda bears to counterbalance them .
i tried to walk her back from the ledge ,
but i think she &apos;s already jumped .
i was like that after i shot the ldsk .
phillip dowd .
yeah . at first i felt nothing .
and then-- gideon was right . it just hit me .
i started to obsess .
looked up photos of him when he was in the rangers .
i studied cases he worked when he was a cop .
i--even patients he treated while he was a nurse .
why ?
i just wanted to get inside of him .
and i wanted to try to understand why our paths crossed
and see if there was some way that he could have been stopped
before i came along .
what made you finally move on ?
all the people he killed .
i put their photos on my wall .
they had lives , too .
if this guy followed our victims
and used a ruse , then he &apos;s not just acting on impulse .
no , it &apos;s organized victimology .
the father figures are likely surrogates for his own .
there were roman numerals
carved into the roofs of their mouths ,
which is highly symbolic .
or ritualistic .
with numbers 3 , 4 , and 5 already found ,
it suggests we &apos;re missing two earlier victims .
kevin &apos;s looking into it .
considering the ruse ,
the unsub is extremely controlled ,
but his m.o. doesn &apos;t make any sense .
then we need to figure out its meaning ,
because he &apos;s not gonna stop until we do .
abandon all hope , ye who enter here .
abandon all hope , ye who enter here .
come on , man .
hey , please . look , i didn &apos;t mean to hit him .
i was just trying to teach him a lesson of right and wrong .
you can understand that , can &apos;t you ?
hey . what &apos;s wrong with you ?
come on , let me out of here .
what are you doing ?
you serious ?
come on , let me out of here .
please .
listen .
hey , come on .
no , no ! come on , no !
come on , listen !
listen , listen , listen , come on !
i love my family . please . please , please , please !
what are you doing ? come on .
oh , my god . oh , jeez .
hey , come on , stop !
oh , god ! no !
abandon all hope , ye who enter here .
1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 .
abandon all hope , ye who enter here .
1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 .
oh , come on ! no , no !
let me out of here !
no ! oh !
abandon all hope , ye who enter here .
abandon all hope , ye who enter here .
abandon all hope , ye who enter here .
hi , this is derek morgan . please leave a message .
chocolate mousse ?
it &apos;s -- it &apos;s baby girl .
clearly we &apos;re both into s &amp; m ,
because you &apos;ve been dodging my calls for the last 24 hours ,
and i keep calling you although you keep dodging my calls .
look , i know we parted mad ,
and you think i &apos;m nutterbutter for coming here , and ...
you &apos;re right ,
because now i &apos;m here and he doesn &apos;t want to see me .
he doesn &apos;t want to see me , derek .
how can i make things better if he doesn &apos;t want to see me ?
so now i &apos;m here at this motel ,
i &apos;m trying not to look at the stains on the bedspread ,
and i &apos;m wrestling with the fact that i have egg on my face ,
and i &apos;m sorry .
no , you know what ? he &apos;s sorry .
he &apos;s gonna be sorry &apos; cause he &apos;s not hanging out with me .
that &apos;s what ...
i don &apos;t even know what i &apos;m saying .
see , i need to talk to you . call me back .
please ?
derek ?
you have a collect call
from baldridge state correctional facility .
if you &apos;d like to accept the charges , please press one .
this is greg baylor .
oh , my gosh . it &apos;s you .
hi . how are you ?
i mean-- that &apos;s a dumb question .
today at 2 : 00 .
ok . ok . today at 2 : 00 .
this unsub &apos;s truly evolving , switching to fire .
this guy &apos;s the king of the changing m.o.
he might just be getting more forensically sophisticated .
fire destroys most trace evidence .
kevin just found two homicides in the city
from the last 8 weeks which might fit our unsub &apos;s m.o.
were they in the comfort zone ?
40 miles out . but they did have
roman numerals 1 and 2 in their mouths .
the first one was asphyxiated by gas
and the other electrocuted .
that probably makes him number 6,
but why burn him in a box ?
you know , it &apos;s shaped more like a casket .
what &apos;s the symbolism ?
maybe this is how he wanted to see the man
who &apos;s at the center of his rage .
because he &apos;s probably in the sixth circle .
circle of what ?
dan chen was found in the mud .
the other guy was crushed to death .
i don &apos;t think these are random m.o.s.
the unsub is recreating the circles of hell .
abandon all hope , ye who enter here .
苏格拉底和柏拉图在他身前 其余人站立 ...
abandon all hope , ye who enter here .
abandon all hope , ye who enter here .
abandon all hope , ye who enter here .
abandon all hope .
we believe the unsub we &apos;re looking for is a male
between the ages of 35 and 40
who is killing parental figures
based on his need for revenge and punishment .
he &apos;s designed his m.o. to recreate dante &apos;s 9 circles of hell .
&quot; the inferno &quot; is the first part of dante &apos;s &quot; divine comedy , &quot;
within it , he describes the sinners he &apos;d encounter
in each circle of hell
and the punishments they &apos;d endured .
the first circle was for those who didn &apos;t accept god ,
therefore lived in limbo , punished by a blinding fog .
the first victim was found gassed in his apartment .
the second circle was for those guilty of lust ,
who &apos;d be blown around in a violent storm .
oh , no ! please ...
therefore , our second victim was tied to a fence
and electrocuted .
the third circle was gluttony ,
where sinners would be rained on and wallow in mud .
our next victim was found strangled on the side of the road
covered with dirt .
our fourth victim was crushed like the punishment
in the next circle reserved for greed .
the fifth circle is wrath ,
where sinners were drowned in swampy water ,
which is exactly what happened to the next victim .
in the sixth , heretics were trapped in a burning tomb ,
like our most recent victim ,
and the next 3 circles are just as vicious .
our unsub killed all the way through the sixth circle
and marked his victims accordingly .
but his victims hadn &apos;t committed the sins
associated with each ring ,
which suggests that the killings
are symbolic of the father figure who hurt him in the past .
in the poem , dante traveled with the poet virgil
who assured him he would enter paradise
if he completed his journey .
consequently , we believe our unsub
is metaphorically taking this journey with someone else .
i will help you .
i will help you . i will help you .
his virgil is most likely a sibling
that suffered the same fate
at the hand of an abusive father .
this man &apos;s patient . we also think he &apos;s an academic .
he stalks his victims ,
and after watching them discipline a child ,
he waits until what he considers
the appropriate moment to kill them .
we believe he will continue with the final 3 circles
until he feels completely avenged .
4 cavities . do you know how much that cost me ?
i &apos;ve been brushing my teeth .
bull !
all you do is eat candy and play video games .
you &apos;re grounded for two weeks
and you &apos;re not going to the ballgame on saturday .
where are we ?
the victims &apos; automobiles were found right here .
and that is where all the victims were last seen
prior to the abductions .
so he &apos;s able to move around freely .
all right , we need to get back to the poem .
an unsub this committed to a body of work
isn &apos;t killing out of the blue .
maybe he &apos;d obsess over the poem ,
maybe even write about it before acting it out .
create a manifesto ?
yeah . at least be literary enough to post his thoughts .
kevin , what did you come up with
on people posting online rants about dante &apos;s &quot; inferno &quot; ?
there are over 80 people in the past week .
subtract high school kids .
we &apos;re not looking for screeds about homework .
you got 5 in the state , my friend .
any in the comfort zone ?
one .
what &apos;s his name ?
nathan chow . he &apos;s a student at puget college .
he posted a blog about killing people at his school
using dante &apos;s 9 circles of hell .
when did he do it ?
a week before the first murder .
he &apos;s a little younger than our profile .
what if he &apos;s our virgil ?
we catch him , we catch our unsub .
send us the address .
nathan chow , fbi !
1 , 2 .
clear .
explosives ?
that &apos;s not circle 7 .
no , but suicide is one of the inner circles of 7 .
this could be the endgame .
nathan ?
you &apos;re under arrest .
you have the right to remain silent .
anything you say can and will be used
against you in a court of law .
you have the right to an attorney ...
and have him present while you &apos;re being questioned .
thank you for agreeing to see me .
how are you ? that &apos;s a dumb question .
you look good . i mean , you look good
especially considering--
is this place as bad as it seems ?
it could use some paint .
i &apos;m nervous . i can &apos;t stop talking . i &apos;m sorry .
look , i know you got my letter .
and i know you tried to hurt me and my friend ,
but i need you to know i never meant for this to happen ,
for you to end up on death row .
i tried to stop this .
you tried to stop this ?
yes . i called the governor .
i wrote him a letter .
you had a horrible upbringing . this isn &apos;t you .
why are you really here ?
i need you to know i &apos;m in your corner .
oh . you &apos;re not here for me .
you &apos;re here for yourself .
that &apos;s not entirely true .
of course it is . you don &apos;t know me .
oh , i know you .
trust me .
oh , so you want me to forgive you .
no .
you want me to say i &apos;m a bad man ,
i love killing , i deserve this ?
no .
then what the hell is it ?
beause i &apos;m done talking .
i &apos;m done feeling guilty .
i got 10 hours left to breathe ,
and the last thing i need is some freaky woman coming up here
with her liberal guilt trying to change things .
i &apos;m a killer .
you can &apos;t change that .
i did it .
i killed them .
all 6 of them ?
yes . abandon all hope , ye who enter here .
dante had that much of an effect on you , huh ?
you figured by taking your victims through hell ,
you &apos;d relieve some kind of pain .
abandon all hope , ye who enter here .
how did you choose the 6 victims ?
were they random , or did they have meaning to you ?
evil isn &apos;t random .
it &apos;s quite precise .
you made a list and started killing .
no .
they chose their fates .
we &apos;re all evil .
men and women .
evil doesn &apos;t discriminate .
so let &apos;s enter through the gates of hell
and talk about the first killing .
you replicated the first circle ?
i put her in a fog and i strangled her .
actually , you chained him in his apartment
and left the oven on .
all the victims were male , nathan .
abandon all hope , ye who enter here .
nathan , we know you &apos;re working with someone .
who are you protecting ?
ye who enter here .
abandon all hope , ye who enter here .
nathan , stop stonewalling us .
you &apos;re his virgil , aren &apos;t you ?
no . i &apos;m dante .
i &apos;m dante .
abandon all hope , ye who enter here .
ok , why is he taking credit for killings he clearly didn &apos;t do ?
ego , maybe .
in the poem , dante and virgil had roles
from which they didn &apos;t stray .
this unsub and his virgil would do the same thing .
so who &apos;s this kid ?
i don &apos;t know . he &apos;s got some relationship with the unsub .
guys , with circles 7 , 8 , and 9 left , we &apos;re running out of time .
we need to dig more deeply into nathan &apos;s life .
i think we &apos;re getting off to an icky start .
i &apos;m done . you should go .
but--
there &apos;s nothing that you can say .
then why did you agree to see me ?
i &apos;m not a friend . i &apos;m not family .
oh , is that it ?
they didn &apos;t come ?
i &apos;m the only one who showed up ?
shut up .
if i was wrong , you would have called the guard over here by now .
you &apos;re afraid .
as tough as you &apos;re acting right now ,
this is the scariest .
and you don &apos;t want to die .
i deserve this .
why the heck did you call me ?
because i don &apos;t want to die alone .
i can &apos;t .
why ?
for a lot of reasons .
i--i--i--i hate--
i hate--i don &apos;t like blood .
it &apos;s an injection .
there &apos;s gotta be someone out there--
no , you were right . i got nobody .
nobody came to visit me . nobody called .
you &apos;re the only human that reached out to me ,
in the letter .
well , maybe the governor will still grant you a stay .
but if he doesn &apos;t ...
then i want somebody there .
i &apos;m scared .
i don &apos;t know .
then i was right .
you &apos;re not here for me .
you &apos;re here for yourself .
no . no . no , wait .
let me out .
take me back .
wait , greg .
i &apos;m done .
greg .
no--greg--
no , greg , wait .
greg .
i didn &apos;t mean ...
could we ...
greg .
greg .
no one in nathan &apos;s life fits the profile .
did you check people in his high school classes ?
yeah . still coming up empty .
all right , i &apos;ve got nathan &apos;s copy of &quot; the inferno &quot;
with detailed notes , but the edition is from 1986 .
and if nathan was in high school two years ago ,
he would have had a more recent edition .
is they a j. leu anywhere in nathan &apos;s life ?
uh , yeah . there &apos;s a justin leu .
he was nathan &apos;s high school ap english teacher .
if you give a kid an early edition of a book ,
it &apos;s because you had a bond .
oh , in nathan &apos;s digital yearbook ,
he says that mr. leu was the only reason
he got through high school .
he took his class twice .
is mr. leu still in the school system ?
yeah , he &apos;s been there for years .
from the looks of it , he &apos;s a very tough teacher .
oh , and please remember your &quot; paradise lost &quot; papers
are due next friday .
don &apos;t forget . thank you .
mr. leu ...
you can &apos;t give me a &quot; b. &quot;
well , that &apos;s what you got .
if i come home with a &quot; b , &quot; my dad &apos;s gonna kill me .
abandon all hope , ye who enter here .

how many hours did you study ?
dad ...
you don &apos;t deserve to eat or sleep .
but , dad--
shut up !
stopped going to church , started drinking .
he was very abusive .
social services said he often locked the kids in a shed .
was the father violent with both boys ?
yes , but according to child protective services ,
mr. leu &apos;s older brother todd got the worst of it .
justin , you shouldn &apos;t be here .
it &apos;s going to be ok . it &apos;s going to be ok .
remember , abandon all hope , ye who enter here .
abandon all hope ...
ye who enter here .
abandon all hope , ye who enter here .
and where &apos;s the brother now ?
todd ?
todd .
todd !
todd !
todd !
he committed suicide .
dad !
so that &apos;s who his virgil is , his brother .
he &apos;s metaphorically going on this journey with him .
maybe the father committed the sins
found within the 9 circles .
an &quot; a &quot; ?
are you serious ?
thanks .
is the father still alive ?
no , he passed away a couple months ago .
justin inherited his house .
that &apos;s what triggered the killing .

and his father &apos;s address .

please , please . please , what are you doing ?
just paying you back .
you idiot .
shut up , dad .
i &apos;m not your dad .
what are you doing ?
are you stupid ?
abandon all hope , ye who enter here .
say it again .
you &apos;re weak , just like your brother .
no !
please ...
don &apos;t hurt me !
you think this is painful ?
wait till you get to hell .
ok , thanks .
hotch and rossi just left the school . justin &apos;s not there .
what about at his apartment ?
it &apos;s empty , too . he has to be headed to his father &apos;s house .
please , i &apos;ll do whatever you want .
i just want you to be nice .
we &apos;re not perfect .
we &apos;re not perfect !
no . you &apos;re dumb !
be quiet !
a &quot; b &quot; in math ?
a b @-@ minus in english ?
shut up .
you and your brother are lazy .
no , be quiet .
you should have both died back then .
fbi !
fbi . don &apos;t do it .
get away !
drop that gun .
you &apos;ve killed enough .
i &apos;m not finished .
please , help me !
killing him &apos;s not gonna help you .
i need to finish this journey .
but you skipped number 7
and went right to 8 , justin .
part of 7 was suicide .
you were gonna try to complete the circles
and save that for yourself .
you don &apos;t know me .
you thought that by killing yourself it would even the score .
but your brother didn &apos;t commit suicide
because he couldn &apos;t live up to your grades , justin .
he was depressed .
no . it &apos;s my fault .
it &apos;s my fault !
it was your father &apos;s .
if he &apos;d have gotten your brother the help he needed ,
none of this would have happened .
listen to her , justin . think about it .
come on , now , it &apos;s over .
put that gun down .
don &apos;t let your father destroy you more than he already has .
i &apos;m sorry , father .
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m sorry .
hi , this is derek morgan . please leave a message .
derek , pick up the phone . i need to talk to you .
i went to go see him .
this whole thing is a mess .
i made things worse by coming here .
i thought i would come and , you know , be an uplifter .
i &apos;m an uplifter .
even on death row i want to be an uplifter .
i wanted to change things . but i can &apos;t change it ,
i can &apos;t fix it ,
because it &apos;s already in motion .
and now i &apos;m here alone , and i know i made my choices to get here ,
but i need you right now .
i don &apos;t even know what i need .
i need you to see me . i need you to witness me
as i go through this . i need to know you &apos;re out there
while i &apos;m going through this . that &apos;s what i need .
open the gate .
amen .
is there anything you want to say ?
thank you .
&quot; it doesn &apos;t take a lot of strength to hang on ,
it takes a lot of strength to let go . &quot;
