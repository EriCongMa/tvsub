long way from jersey , officers .

so ...
we got a policy around here .
you walk in with a badge ...
leave in a bag .
so i &apos;m gonna ask you one time :

the man asked you a question , didn &apos;t he ?
no , no , no , danny , you can &apos;t stop there .
hey , you can &apos;t leave me hanging . come on .

steve , don &apos;t move .
monkey , how we doing in there ?
you almost ready to go ?
almost .
you know , you can always wait next door with a boba .
a boba ? uh , i don &apos;t know what a boba is ,
but i &apos;m pretty sure i don &apos;t want one . thank you .
do you like it ?
i don &apos;t like it .
i do not like it . i ... i love it .
it is perfect .
it is beautiful . that is definitely the one .
that &apos;s fantastic .
let me take a picture . you ready ? bing .
all right , i got it .
what was that for ?
thanks for being my date tonight .
i know how much you hate dancing .
i don &apos;t hate dancing .
i like dancing . i &apos;m a dancing fool .
come on . let &apos;s get out of here .
what &apos;s the special occasion ?
uh , there &apos;s a father @-@ daughter dance .
like there &apos;s not enough opportunities in life
for me to embarrass myself .
you &apos;ll have a great time . she &apos;ll remember it forever .
kids grow up so fast .
oh , and you being all of 18 years old , you know this how ?
next thing you know , you &apos;ll be buying her a wedding gown .
yeah , yeah , right after i take out
a second mortgage on my house ,
if i actually owned a house .
have a super day .
thank you .
hold on one second .
don &apos;t give me that look .
we are going to the dance .
i promise 100 % , okay ?
danny .
thanks . come on .
so i take it
this is not a kid dropping mentos into his soda pop .
and not a gas leak , either .
a surfer on his way to chun &apos;s reef
saw an explosion from the road and called 911 .
look at this guy . he &apos;s like a kid in a candy store .
he thinks there &apos;s only one vic ,
but he &apos;s got to put humpty dumpty back together again
before he can confirm it .
this is , uh , quite a puzzle you &apos;ve got there , max .
with very broken pieces .
the body sustained exceptional impact ,
so i &apos;m unable to confirm a cause of death or give you an i.d.
until i complete the , uh ... assembly .
understandable .
oh , i trust your shopping expedition went well ?
oh , yeah , it was good .
uh , we found something nice . thanks for the suggestion .
wonderful . i &apos;ll tell my niece it was a success .
oh , please do .
now , if you &apos;ll excuse me , i am short one right arm .
right behind you .
oh . mahalo .
uh , what else do we know ?
well , the house is a rental .
i &apos;m trying to track down the owners ,
but they &apos;re in japan on business .
also found a cell phone ,
and i sent it over to the crime lab for processing .
hey . what &apos;s up ?
heard you went dress shopping .
that &apos;s right .
there something i should know ?
something ? yeah , i like to wear dresses .
what , you always go for the cheap shot ?
subtlety doesn &apos;t work with you .
a hammer is always best .
i &apos;m just hoping you got something
with a nice , plunging neckline
so you can show off that chewbacca chest .
oh , that &apos;s ... that &apos;s funny .
for your information ,
i had to buy a dress for grace .
uh , there &apos;s a father @-@ daughter dance tonight .
oh ... but you can &apos;t dance .
sure , i can dance . i just choose not to .
that &apos;s a smart move .
excuse me ?
you forget i saw you dance at my wedding , brah .
yeah , the overbite shuffle .
i remember .
oh , is everybody done with their cute critiques ?
okay , what are you looking at ?
a fragment from the housing
of the explosive device .
okay , does that device have a name ?
okay , danny , you can &apos;t just walk into a bomb scene ,
poke a few things around , stick a finger in the air
and say with any degree of certainty .
this is a high @-@ velocity , peroxide @-@ based explosive
moving at 17,500 feet per second .
okay , that @-@ that sounds pretty certain to me .
yeah , i &apos;ve had some experience in this area .
you see this white crystalline residue ?
take a whiff of that .
okay , it smells like bleach .
yeah , that &apos;s the hallmark of tatp , triacetone triperoxide .
it &apos;s highly explosive
and it &apos;s highly unstable .
i never heard of it .
i saw this a lot in the ieds on the road to kabul .
i mean , it &apos;s all over the middle east .
okay , if it &apos;s so big in the middle east ,
what is it doing here in hawaii ?
that &apos;s a good question .
max ?
hey , want a hand with that ?
i &apos;m good , thank you .
by the way , commander ,
your olfactory receptors are quite exceptional .
what you smelled was indeed
tatp , triacetone triperoxide .
as far as explosives go ,
it &apos;s , uh , quite a simple recipe .
you can practically get everything
from your local drugstore .
as you can see from my reconstruction ,
the blast distribution pattern indicates
that the victim was hunched over the device
when it was inadvertently triggered .
hunched over ? so this idiot blows himself up
accidentally while trying to build a bomb ?
correct .
what about an i.d. , max ?
i did get a hit on a dna sample .
&quot; qaseem ramzi &quot;
there wasn &apos;t much on him that i could find .
apparently , he was a radical student
expelled from saudi arabia
for engaging in antigovernment activities .
okay , so qaseem ramzi , he comes over to the island ,
he rents a place in the middle of nowhere ,
he tries to build a bomb .
the question is : does he work alone ?
no . terrorists don &apos;t work alone .
they ... they work in cells .
that way , if one guy goes down ,
his buddy comes in and finishes the job .
okay , you just said the &quot; t &quot; word .
okay , does this look like the end of something to you ?
because to me , this is just the beginning .
lieutenant catherine rollins ,
assistant to steve mcgarrett .
how can i help you ?
did you ever think that maybe ,
just maybe , i can &apos;t live without you ?
no , no , she &apos;s way too smart to fall for that .
you really think i &apos;m gonna fall for that ?
see ?
where are you ?
the hilton .
nice . keeping busy ?
uh , no ,
but that &apos;s the point of r &amp; r , isn &apos;t it ?
you &apos;ve already tipped your hand by calling me ,
so why don &apos;t you just show me your cards ?
all right , here &apos;s a name to run down :
qaseem ramzi . r @-@ a @-@ m @-@ z @-@ i .
guy came online after he was expelled from saudi
for radical activities .
what &apos;s your interest ?
he &apos;s here .
here ?
well , i mean , he was here .
he blew himself up making a bomb in liliha .
what , you think this is part of a larger plot ?
i don &apos;t know yet ,
but i got the governor on standby .
now , listen , catherine , this is really important .
i need you to get me all the intel
on ramzi you can , okay ?
even rumors .
all right , i &apos;m on it .
you gonna tell me ?
am i gonna tell you what ?
what &apos;s going on in that head .
okay , uh ...
i am thinking about the fact that
this is a very dangerous world that we live in .
we got nut jobs like ramzi running around ,
and at the same time , i am thinking about the fact
that i have a very beautiful daughter ...
yes , you do , and you &apos;re her father
and you love her , and ...
and you try real hard to protect her .
that &apos;s my point .
too little , too late , maybe .
what are you talking about , danny ?
i am talking about the fact
that grace and every other kid her age
is growing up in fortress america , right ?
whether grace knows it or not ,
she will have lived her entire life
under the threat of another attack .
don &apos;t you think you &apos;re being a tad dramatic , danny ?
absolutely not . i am not being dramatic at all , steve .
i am simply stating a fact .
because of one day ,
because of one day ,
my daughter will never know what it &apos;s like to board a plane
without being groped or harassed for 45 minutes .
did you grow up like that ? i didn &apos;t grow up like that .
no , i did not .
no , you did not ,
and i ... i never wanted that for my daughter .
i never wanted it for any kid .
that is not the way it is supposed to be . that &apos;s all .
we got a better fix on the bomb
that killed ramzi while he was arming it .
the device was built to be controlled by a radio link ,
so the actual bomber could be sitting
in a parked car a block away .
that &apos;s the same technology used against
coalition forces in afghanistan and iraq .
yeah , and whoever designed the thing
really knew what they were doing .
any luck pulling any data off the cell phone
we found at the crime scene ?
yeah .
the lab pulled one readable bit
from the call history
made approximately 24 hours ago to a landline in waipahu .
address is 680 malakeke street .
movement , movement .
hey , hey ! do not move ! don &apos;t move !
drop the weapon now . hey .
drop the weapon right now .
don &apos;t move !
go easy .
put down the weapon now .
drop the gun ...
drop it !
are you guys okay ?
yeah .
this gun &apos;s not loaded .
not loaded ? so , what , he wanted us to kill him ?
no . he didn &apos;t want to be taken alive .
where &apos;s chin ?
come with me .
what the hell is this , santa &apos;s workshop ?
check this out .
schools ,
the heco power plant at kahe point ,
the airport .
targets .
okay , so we got bad guys on the island
with multiple choice of targets .
what do we think ?
the power plant and the airport both have
a @-@ plus security , right ?
and they follow every dhs guideline
and they employ every physical enhancement .
but the softer targets like the schools ,
they &apos;re going to be harder to defend against an attack .
yeah , these guys want to make a statement .
they &apos;re gonna want the maximum amount of economic loss
with as many casualties as possible .
that &apos;s right . we need to alert these targets .
chin , contact hpd .
have them secure the locations .
hey , cath .
what do you got ?
i pulled that intel you asked me for .
check this out .
recognize this guy ?
that &apos;s qaseem ramzi .
and this guy .
ayham al safi .
you know him ?
uh , kind of , yeah .
short relationship .
when was this video taken ?
uh , 16 months ago in london .
it was part of an mi @-@ 5 surveillance op .
mi @-@ 5 ? what &apos;s their interest ?
this guy right here .
hasan farooq .
pakistani , educated in england .
trained as an electrical engineer .
ah . that comes in handy for building bombs .
farooq is believed to have recruited his friends
al safi and ramzi .
and now they &apos;re here .
yeah .
if al safi and ramzi are here on o &apos;ahu ,
you can be pretty sure that farooq can &apos;t be far away .
okay , if farooq knows that his friends are dead ,
maybe he will back off .
or he &apos;ll become more determined .
whatever the case , we need to find farooq right away .
guys .
they got something .
okay , pull him back . get him out of here .
easy , easy , easy ...
that &apos;s c @-@ 4 .
that &apos;s enough c @-@ 4 to blow up an entire city block .
what &apos;s that red stuff ?
that &apos;s flexible rubberized explosive .
there are serrated marks on the edge .
i &apos;m guessing that &apos;s bad .
this is only half a roll .
so where &apos;s the other half ?
no , mom , listen .
mom , i can &apos;t disclose that information to you .
you know that . you &apos;re a civilian now .
no , rachel , i do not know when or where .
don &apos;t you think that if i had that information ,
i would share it with you ?
okay , well , fine .
use that skill set to indentify a secure location
and stay there if necessary .
no , nothing .
nothing . please , do not tell her anything .
as far as she knows , i &apos;m picking her up ,
we &apos;re going to the dance just like we planned .
mom , i have to go .
i have to go . bye .
all right , just take care of yourselves ,
and i &apos;ll call you as soon as i can .
bye .
rachel and grace , they all right ?
yeah .
that was actually the first civil conversation
rachel and i have had in several months .
who knew that it would take the fear of imminent death
to make us cordial to one another ?
that &apos;s nice .
kono , what &apos;s up ?
more intel on ayham al safi .
turns out he was using the alias &quot; randy ramirez &quot;
to rent the cottage he was living in .
he got a bogus i.d. and a credit card .
&quot; randy ramirez &quot; then used that card
to rent a town car from premium rentals .
hey , listen , can you get a location on the car ?
farooq could be driving it right now to a target location .
i just talked to the rental company manager .
all their vehicles have an antitheft tracking device .
they gave me the log @-@ in info .
i &apos;m activating it now .
we got a hit .
you got an address ?
t @-@ 100 palm circle drive .
that &apos;s fort shafter .
that &apos;s the u.s. army &apos;s pacific headquarters .
guys , there &apos;s a retirement ceremony
for a three @-@ star general on palm circle today .
the secretary of defense is attending the ceremony .
that &apos;s the target .
the entire pacific military leadership in one spot .
chin , notify hpd and the army bomb squad .
tell them we &apos;re looking at a major terrorist event .
you got that ?
copy .
command , attention !
present , arms !
order , arms !
parade , rest !
aloha .
thank you all for coming .
it &apos;s good to be with you here
on this beautiful morning ,
and it &apos;s great to see
such an incredible turnout
here on historic palm circle
to help me honor my friend ,
my old friend , general krakower .
now , before we bring out the rocking chair ...
... first , i would like to acknowledge
the distinguished leaders of the united states army ,
civilian and military ,
and the u.s. state department , who are with us here today ...
... as well as the leadership of our other services .
listen to what i &apos;m telling you .
you need to evacuate the area right now .

commander mcgarrett , this gps what you wanted ?
yes , sir . thanks , master sergeant .
all right , farooq drove the car here from an address in waikiki .
we start there .
farooq &apos;s gone .
hey , steve .
found this upstairs .
guys .
farooq &apos;s fake documents .
without them , he can &apos;t leave the country .
looks like farooq is planning to run .
chin , notify hpd .
kono , run facial recognition
through every security camera on the island .
focus on commercial and noncommercial ports
and airfields , okay ?
if you need more eyes , call homeland security .
all right , you got it .
all right .
you and me ... we &apos;re gonna sit on this house .
farooq &apos;s not going anywhere without this .
monkey , what are you talking about ? what do you think ?
i bought you that dress for no reason ?
we are going , okay ?
you have danno &apos;s 100 % guarantee that we are going tonight .
okay ?
all right . i &apos;ll see you very soon , and i love you .
okay , bye .
&quot; danno &apos;s 100 % guarantee . &quot; sounds serious .
uh , father @-@ daughter dance tonight .
oh , right . right , right , right .
i cannot miss it .
you &apos;re not gonna miss it .
okay , well , don &apos;t jinx it .
how ... i &apos;m not ... i &apos;m not gonna jinx it .
okay , well , don &apos;t say anything else about it .
you gonna wear a suit ?
what &apos;d i just say ?
what did i just say ?
you told me not to talk about the dance .
i &apos;m talking about your wardrobe .
what i choose to wear
and tonight &apos;s dance are directly related .
okay .
you know what i &apos;d like ?
i &apos;d like one moment , one moment with my daughter
that is not affected by this job .
borrowed time .
&quot; borrowed time &quot; ?
borrowed time .
i got to keep reminding myself this is borrowed time .
what are you talking about ?
this . here . me . last ten years
of my life with my daughter-- it is borrowed time .
i was not supposed to have any of this .
yes , yes , i am scared , all right ?
i am also anxious and nervous .
i am discombobulated-- yes , i use that word .
but , most of all , i am happy .
okay ? let me break it down-- i am 60 % happy ,
i am 30 % completely terrified ,
and i am 10 % discombobulated .
yes , it is a real word .
see ? this is why you suck at scrabble .
okay , listen , i love you very much , rachel ,
and i will see you when i get home , okay ? bye .
you are having a bad day , my friend . okay .
so , you get , uh ...
get pulled over on the turnpike-- busted taillight .
got no i.d. , no car insurance , so ...
uniform runs your plates , finds out that the car is stolen .
now ... that is a big , dumb , ignorant rookie mistake , papi .
always , and i mean always ,
check the lights before you steal a car .
okay , but ... the plot thickens , okay ?
the subsequent search of that car turns up
an unregistered firearm and $ 50,000 cash .
now , i am positive , absolutely positive ,
there is a reasonable explanation for all this ,
so i am going to ask you , where did you get the money ?
i just won the pick @-@ 6 , man .
and the gun ?
never seen it before .
cops dropped it under my front seat
when they pulled me over .
of course . you were , uh ...
you were set up . i apologize .
okay , so i &apos;m gonna make this very simple for you--
you answer my questions , you cooperate ,
then there &apos;s a small chance that you get out of prison
before you are middle @-@ aged , all right ?
so i &apos;m gonna ask you again , where did you get the money ?
your mom gave it to me last night .
that &apos;s , uh ... that &apos;s the wrong answer .
but it was good .
uh , you know , normally ,
i would bounce your head off of the steel table ,
but you caught me on a good day . i &apos;m in a good mood .
so , uh ... you have a shot .
excuse me .
fingerprint results just came back .
tell me this guy &apos;s got a sheet .
oh , he &apos;s got a sheet .
name &apos;s nicky bova .
priors include aggravated assault , arson , burglary .
this guy &apos;s a three @-@ strikes candidate .
what is he still doing on the street ?
he &apos;s mobbed up .
bova &apos;s uncle lou is a capo for the deangelis family .
right . jersey &apos;s finest .
cash was probably for a drug buy .
i dumped his phone-- found a voice mail
setting up a meet in the city
two hours from now , uptown by the bridge .
good . want to go crash a party ?
i &apos;ll drive . i called it .
can i drive my car once ?
is that so much to ask , huh ?
no . no , no , no .
danny , you can &apos;t stop there .
come on , what happens next ?
that &apos;s him . that &apos;s farooq .
five @-@ o ! farooq ! stay where you are !
get down !
danny ...
stop , stop , stop .
what is it ?
steve .
don &apos;t come any closer , all right ? stay right there .
don &apos;t move . don &apos;t move , don &apos;t move , don &apos;t move . stop .
what ?
what the hell is that ?
it &apos;s a proximity sensor .
it &apos;s an infrared radiation beam that detects movement .
you have to stay completely still .
okay , wh ...
what if i can &apos;t stay completely still ?
then this bomb &apos;s gonna detonate .
you and me are both gonna die .
what &apos;s it doing ?
it &apos;s okay , man . it &apos;s gonna identify the wires in the box
so they know what tools to send in with the guy .
okay ?
yeah .
okay , so just breathe easy , pal . you &apos;re doing great .
steve , i need you to do me a favor , okay ?
what do you need ?
i need you to call grace .
tell her i &apos;m sorry , okay ?
what are you sorry for ?
sorry for missing the dance .
but you &apos;re gonna make the dance , danny .
says you i &apos;m gonna make the dance .
no , how about danno &apos;s 100 % guarantee ? remember that ?
yeah .
you gave that to her , okay ?
yeah .
all right .
all right .
just don &apos;t move .
don &apos;t move . all right .
want to hear something crazy right now ?
sure .
i &apos;d kill for a hank &apos;s haute dog .
don &apos;t laugh .
yeah , i bet you would , buddy .
all right , so you &apos;re in the warehouse , right ?
the story-- it was just getting good . let &apos;s go .
you were in the warehouse . what happened next ?
you think , uh , that &apos;s supposed to take my mind off of things ?
you got a better idea ?
no , i don &apos;t got a better idea .
now , i &apos;m gonna ask you again , copper .
how &apos;d you find out about this place ?
well , why are you here ?
uh , i &apos;m here because i wanted ...
to get a box of t @-@ bones .
does that hurt ?
all right .
forget the t @-@ bones .
let &apos;s have some baby back ribs .
mighty tough .
this a tough guy .
he got a mouth on him , can take a hit .
yeah , yeah , i can take a beating all day long , buddy .
all right , tough guy ,
let &apos;s see how tough your partner is .
now , look , pretty ,
you tell me what i &apos;m asking
and i don &apos;t have to mess up your pretty little face .
you feel like a tough guy , hitting a woman ?
no . i just like hitting cops .
little ray , he &apos;s all yours .
i like ... hitting cops , too .
now , now , it doesn &apos;t have to be this way ,
you know that , right ?
it does have to be this way .
there &apos;s no other way .
come on , who told you about this place ?
a little bird .
well , what &apos;s the birdie &apos;s name ?
uh , i can &apos;t tell you that ,
because if i do ,
you &apos;re gonna find him
and you &apos;re gonna kill him ,
and there goes my star witness ,
because when i &apos;m done flipping him ,
he &apos;s going to send you and these two clowns that work for you
and everybody you &apos;ve ever done business with your entire life
to prison for a long time , you understand ?
now , that &apos;s insulting .
yeah ,
&apos;cause this clown right here is my brother ,
and apparently , you &apos;re sleepwalking ,
so , ray , will you please wake his ass up ?
with pleasure .
hmm , maybe the little birdie &apos;s name is on this paper .
oh . looks like somebody &apos;s about to be a daddy .
is it a boy or a girl ?
i don &apos;t know ,
but he &apos;ll never find out .
you shouldn &apos;t have done that .
now i promise i &apos;m gonna hurt you .
oh , you &apos;re gonna what ? you &apos;re gonna hurt me ?
yeah , i &apos;ll be starting with ray , but eventually ,
you and i are gonna tangle , and when we do ,
it &apos;s not going to be good for you ,
you understand me ?
all right .
now , we know you don &apos;t want to die
&apos;cause you &apos;re about to become a daddy ,
so i &apos;m gonna give you one last chance
to get rid of that smart ass ,
and tell me what i want to know :
how &apos;d you find out about this place ?
ray .
hey , ray ?
do me a favor . will you work the back a little bit ?
feel a little tense .
why can &apos;t we shoot him ?
&apos;cause he &apos;s a knight .
a what ?
this is a knight right here .
this ain &apos;t no damn knight .
no , no , you gotta ...
you gotta take away all of that armor ,
and take away the mask .
they look like old slick here .
but i think it &apos;s all an act to impress the ladies .
you know , a chivalry thing .
right , tough guy ?
but what &apos;s funny ,
once you remove that from the equation ,
they &apos;re nothing .
grace !
danny ...
grace , grace ...
oh , you son of a bitch . i &apos;m gonna kill you .
you hear me ? i &apos;m ... i &apos;m gonna kill you .
grace ?
grace ? i &apos;m gonna kill you .
now , we both know that that &apos;s not going to happen .
now , i was nice to your partner .
by the time i &apos;m done with you ,
you &apos;re going to be begging me to put you down .
so , i want you to think about your answer .
because this one is for keeps , jersey .
who else knows we &apos;re here ?
uh , besides me and my partner ?
the entire newark police department .
okay , you idiots don &apos;t know this ,
but you are surrounded right now , okay ?
yeah , well , now you bleed .
go check it out .
billy !
you guys mind if i join you ?
i &apos;ve got a date with your friend here .
good to see you , man .
hello , darling .
what &apos;ve we got ?
c @-@ 4 , ball bearings , nails ...
this thing was built to make a big mess .
okay , can we not talk about that now , please ?
don &apos;t worry , you &apos;re in good hands .
i guess i don &apos;t have to tell you to keep still .
no .
my buddy was just wrapping up a story here , right , danny ?
don &apos;t let me stop you .
this shouldn &apos;t take too long .
so , danny ?
so , you and your partner ,
i bet you didn &apos;t tell anybody where you were going , right ?
no , of course not .
grace ?
grace .
grace , come on , grace .
grace . grace .
grace .
hello , officer down here !
