you and your stupid makeup .
we missed halloween !
i &apos;d like to welcome all of the principals
from the springfield school district ,
including skin @-@ ner !
wein @-@ berg !
sack @-@ ett !
and gwendolyn hertz @-@ feld @-@ mastroantonio !
we are here for the annual dance of the lemons ,
where each of you gets to trade
your worst teacher to another school .
the union &apos;s happy , the parents are placated ,
and only the children suffer .
chalmskinn .
behold your lemons !
sociopathic child haters who are only teachers
because they got tenure after two short years .
that &apos;s mean !
you know what you are .
first lemon :
from springfield elementary , going to west springfield ,
third grade teacher , sticky @-@ fingers stella .
now , going to springfield elementary ...
god have mercy .
seymour , your new teacher is ...
everybody pray !
this is a public school .
i said pray !
mr. lassen is here .
no smoking .
so , mr. lassen ,
you began your career at shelbyville prep .
it seems that certain wealthy parents didn &apos;t like
seeing their precious darlings duct @-@ taped to the wall .
mm @-@ hmm . and then you entered the public system .
that &apos;s where i got this scar .
what scar ?
oh , i see you &apos;re left @-@ handed .
so , that concludes my evaluation .
enjoy fourth grade .
so , any dirt on the new teacher ?
is he stingy with the pumpkin stickers ?
does he have ocd ? ocd ? ocd ?
i don &apos;t know .
but in ten minutes , i &apos;m gonna have him kneeling before zod .
in this example , i &apos;m zod .
when he opens the door ...
that &apos;s kind of scary ,
but it doesn &apos;t make me pee my pants .
hello .
i &apos;m mr. lassen .
you mean mr. less @-@ than ?
so , a comedian , are you ?
i got a pretty solid ten minutes .
well , i could do five minutes on your pathetic vest
and five minutes on your ugly buck teeth .
and i &apos;ve got a whole hbo special &apos;s worth on your fat mama !
my mom can &apos;t afford to be fat-- she &apos;s an exotic dancer .
and in what exotic location does she dance ?
a touch of class .
but the &quot; c @-@ l &quot; fell off .
son , there was never a &quot; c @-@ l. &quot;
i @-@ i think i always knew that !
bart , this guy served two tours in middle school .
abort prank !
i will not .
anything to delay a spelling test .
looks like i &apos;ve got a prankster on my hands .
you know , son ,
school code says a student &apos;s hair
should be of uniform length .
what are you gonna do to him ?
quiet ... smellson .
smellson ? i prayed no one would ever think of that !
how was your first day at school , bart ?
terrible .
you want to talk about it ?
no .
oh , thank you .
why are you wearing your hat at dinner ?
this new teacher i got gave me a haircut .
a haircut ? let me see .
no .
come on . please ?
no , you &apos;ll laugh at me .
i won &apos;t laugh at you . let &apos;s see .
look at me . i &apos;m bart.
we &apos;re sorry .
stop that , all of you .
it &apos;s not bart &apos;s fault that his haircut looks so stupid .
i didn &apos;t know that a teacher could cut kids &apos; hair .
teachers &apos; union won the right in their last strike .
i &apos;m going to go to that school and talk to that teacher .
marge , please don &apos;t say anything .
it never makes a difference ,
and then the teachers give us stink @-@ eye
during the school fairs .
well , if he &apos;s gonna get a haircut ,
bart should at least have gotten a balloon with it .
well , anyway , bart ,
you &apos;ll cheer up on our camping trip this weekend .
what camping trip ?
the one you booked for us at owl haven .
the one you have to reserve a year in advance .
you told me not to do it a year ago . remember ?
i don &apos;t remember that .
you &apos;re right . no one can be expected
to remember something from a year ago .
certainly not me . pass the gravy .
don &apos;t tell me you didn &apos;t reserve a campsite .
labor day is next weekend . there &apos;ll be nothing left .
hey , there &apos;s always room at buzzard &apos;s roost .
excuse me , but buzzard &apos;s roost is a converted parking lot .
excuse me , but grass is poking through .
why do i ever put you in charge of the littlest thing ?
parking lot !
poking through !
parking lot !
poking through !
my biggest sin is that i dare to hope .
oh , marge , i can &apos;t stand it when you cry at dinner .
the pork chops look traumatized .
the mashed potatoes can &apos;t stand to watch .
even the children seem upset .
so trust me , i will come through for you , baby .
not you .
so what do you say , marge ?
i want so much to believe you .
and i want you to believe me , too .
isn &apos;t it great how much we agree ?
巴图 · 辛普森写
looks like our blackboard has been defaced .
lucky for you , i can take a joke .
hello ? hello ? is everything okay ?
here &apos;s ... millie !
excuse me , you ruined my report .
fine . you got an &quot; a. &quot;
oh ! yippee ! fourth @-@ grade &quot; a &quot; !
you might fool some people , el barto , but not me .
now we &apos;re gonna learn about electricity .
hey , live wire . come up here .
touch the generator .
even i think this is too far .
quiet , smellson .
it &apos;s sticking .
i just need to get to 60 % .
milhouse , i &apos;m gonna get back at lassen .
now , the hobbit taught us
that every dragon has a chink in its armor .
it also taught us
that new zealand &apos;s beautiful landscapes
and attractive tax credits
add up to a filmmaker &apos;s paradise .
to find out lassen &apos;s weakness ,
i hid a camera in the teachers &apos; lounge .
史金纳的午餐
wrong order !
you seem lonely and kind of weird .
you left out &quot; single . &quot;
mind if i heat up some goulash ?
let &apos;s continue this online .
i &apos;ve created a fake ms. hoover profile .
when lassen friends her ,
we &apos;ll know everything about him .
i don &apos;t know , bart.
you &apos;re lying about your identity ?
that &apos;s against the terms and conditions .
we &apos;ve all read the terms and conditions , milhouse .
look , i really need a campsite .
my wife is making sandwiches .
sorry , reservations are a year in advance .
what about mosquito cove ?
booked .
skunk canyon ?
booked every year since 2003 .
ooh , how about the campsite where the guy in the hockey mask
kills all the campers ?
sir , that &apos;s a movie .
hello ? hello ? this is homer simpson .
742 evergreen terrace .
looking for a place for my kids and me .
and my pretty , pretty wife .
you know , alarm code 3679 .
3679 !
so i hear you &apos;re getting back at lassen .
maybe i am . so ?
you got to do it , man . he preys on the weak .
now , give me your lunch money .
i &apos;ll take that .
here &apos;s lassen &apos;s profile .
杰克 · 拉森
what the ... ?
tagged as lassen ?
it says these were taken at blazing guy .
what &apos;s blazing guy ?
oh , that &apos;s convenient .
helloha .
do you want to make your home in a self @-@ sustaining city
that only exists a few days a year ?
one that combines nudity , dust storms ,
children and all @-@ consuming fires ?
then you , my bro or brah ,
are dreaming of blazing guy .
on the last day ,
the chosen one , or ignis ,
sets fire to the giant wooden guy
in a ritual dating back to 1986 .
the blazing guy council of elders ,
in conjunction with duraflame , is very pleased to announce
that this year &apos;s ignis is jack lassen .
so if we go there with a camera
to film lassen humiliating himself ,
i &apos;ll get revenge for him making me into this .
i was trying to even it out .
you &apos;re starting to look like your dad .
no .
i &apos;m lucky . i look just like my mom .
gosh , that was a hard sleeping bag to roll up .
those were your father &apos;s sweatpants .
marge ,
i have a confession to make about this trip .
dad , don &apos;t worry .
i got you a place .
once again , i &apos;ve been saved from any consequences .
it &apos;ll keep happening till one day
i create a mess so enormous it can &apos;t be cleaned up .
thanks , boy .
* a @-@ camping we will go *
* but where ? i still don &apos;t know *
* a place that &apos;s filled with sun and sand *
* a desert steampunk disneyland *
* keep expectations low *
* swing low , sweet chariot *
让我们觉得自己很像乡巴佬
homer simpson , i love you .
a world of anarchic free expression .
cars shaped like cupcakes !
i &apos;m home .
i &apos;m home .
no , no , no , don &apos;t blow me out , wise guy .
not in the mood .
i &apos;m not sure this campground is family @-@ friendly .
all camping is pointless .
you drive hundreds of miles to shower and sleep
in a place with no bathroom or beds .
i guess what i &apos;m trying to say is : where &apos;s maggie ?
we brought cheerios for you .
now , you know the wind does kick up here .
hope you went three feet down with your tent stakes .
uh , listen here , desert arnaz .
homer simpson knows how to pitch a tent .
hey man , can i bum a tent ?
you seem stressed .
have some calming tea .
finally . a normal person .
thank you , miss , um ...
calypso self @-@ knowledge .
is that tea ... adulterated ?
does that look like something i &apos;d do ?
hey , marge .
we got a new tent from a guy
who just o.d. &apos; d .
aw , let me get a picture of that .
i think smitty &apos;s still inside .
oh , too bad he &apos;s missing this .
so many musical choices .
a brass band .
barbershop quintet ?
the human kazoo .
oh , a drum circle .
can i help you , freak ?
no .
there he is .
his nipples are asymmetrical .
this could ruin him .
milhouse , everyone here is a total freak .
we have to find a way to completely humiliate lassen .
get a picture of a restaurant check with no tip ,
put it online , say it was him .
kaboom , he &apos;s finished .
suddenly this place doesn &apos;t seem so bad .
this place is great .
just have to avoid these inseam @-@ high cactuses .
oh . are you mr. clean ?
compared to the rest of these people , yeah .
so give the tooth fairy my forwarding address ,
&apos;cause it &apos;s pretty loose .
about time . it &apos;s the only phone .
you don &apos;t count .
maybe we should just give up on lassen .
no . this ignis thing is the biggest deal of his life .
and i &apos;m gonna wreck it .
because he scarred me forever .
hey , it grew back .
a little better , even .
so full and lush .
enough .
it &apos;s like someone ironed out
all the wrinkles in my brain .
get in the tent .
oh , you always save me , trombone elephant .
fire retardant ?
if lassen can &apos;t light that thing , he &apos;ll be humiliated .
what good is an ignis who can &apos;t blaze the guy ?
i &apos;m scared , bart.
and i am never scared .
hideous .
these kids are gonna ruin the ceremony .
it &apos;s too bad i &apos;m just an illusion .
homie , you promised me an incredible camping trip ,
and i got one .
just like i planned .
you got very lucky this time .
don &apos;t push it .
i understand .
i already signed up for this place next year .
i gave my form and $ 200 cash to that dude .
ignis , approach the burning man .
i mean blazing guy .
get the job done .
you &apos;re not helping .
strip him of his nudity .
you .
maybe we won &apos;t have blazing guy ,
but we can still have ...
blazing boy .
what , uh ...
help me , desert weirdos .
i &apos;ll take those .
beware the butterfly &apos;s sting .
what the ... ?
form a human prison
and hold him for five days .
no .
wait , how many days ?
hey , listen , we should probably get home .
my dad forgot to bring water .
when will this tea get out of my system ?
what the ... ?
according to this file from blazing guy secret security ,
your behavior was so egregious
we can do something that we &apos;ve never done before :
fire a teacher .
hand in your red pen .
oh . not gonna pass fingernail inspection tonight .
so where do you go from here ?
a place where my talents will be appreciated .
all right , lights out .
you , too , freak .
you hate him , too ?
with every fiber of what &apos;s left of my wretched soul .
we should team up . i can get you out of here .
a partner ? intriguing . who gets to gut him
like a little pot @-@ bellied salmon ?
i assumed we &apos;d take turns .
no deal .
