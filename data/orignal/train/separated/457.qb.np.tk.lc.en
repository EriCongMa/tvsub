magnum opus
do you think he knows about us ?
as far as i can tell he doesn &apos;t .
well , guess i &apos;ll talk to you next sunday .
bye . love you .
i need to tell you something .
maeve is missing . i think her stalker has her .
please help me .
help me find her .
see , it &apos;s not about the message .
it &apos;s about the medium . what he used to draw on her face .
it &apos;s black eyeliner .
the stalker &apos;s a woman .
excuse me , doctor .
i think i know who the unsub is .
where did you get maeve &apos;s clothes ?
from her closet .
right after i bashed her head in .
get on the ledge .
if you &apos;re gonna kill me , you kill me ,
but i am not jumping .
spencer has a different idea .
take your gun and vest off and come in alone .
let me take her place .
you would kill yourself for her ?
yes .
wait !
danielle , it &apos;s kelly--again .
where are you ? when i said let &apos;s go out dancing tonight ,
i didn &apos;t expect it to involve you leaving me alone
while you scam on some frat guy .
call me . you &apos;ve got 10 minutes , then i &apos;m out of here .
hello ?
hey , baby .
how was work ?
it sucked . tips were horrible .
thought i &apos;d check on spence on my way into work .
yeah . me , too .
are these all from you ?
maybe .
what &apos;s in that one ?
mixed nuts and seeds .
i &apos;m trying to think of something that will help him feel better .
so i went reid @-@ like and i did a bunch of research
and it turns out that nuts and seeds
have naturally occurring magnesium ,
and magnesium influences the production of serotonin ,
which is a happy happy joy joy chemical in the brain .
i don &apos;t know .
spence , listen , if you &apos;re in there ,
we just want to know that you &apos;re all right .
knock twice if you &apos;re conscious .
is he ever gonna be ok ?
eventually .
and he knows we &apos;re all here for him ,
no matter what .
yeah . what she said .
come on .
ok .
hello . this is spencer reid . please leave a message .
hey , reid , it &apos;s me . again .
hey , we &apos;re gathering .
all right , i &apos;m coming .
now , listen , kid , uh , give me a call when you can .
was that him ?
voicemail .
it &apos;s been two weeks .
you ok ?
yeah .
well , no .
sometimes i wonder if i hadn &apos;t
pushed him so hard to meet maeve ...
blake , you can &apos;t blame yourself for encouraging him .
i know . i know .
it was bound to happen no matter what .
i miss reid .
did he tell you how long ?
no . i told him to take as much time as he needed .
at least i got a chance to say good @-@ bye to carolyn .
i can &apos;t imagine--
ladies and gents , the golden state awaits .
meet who was formerly gary porter .
he was found dead outside a san francisco night club last night .
and pamela hurd--
she was found near a cable car stop
in san francisco &apos;s mission district .
they were both found wrapped in clear plastic .
it says here they were dead only a few hours before they were found .
that &apos;s not long enough for the elements
to have made them that pale .
&apos;cause that &apos;s where we enter
the town of weirdville on the corner of eew and icky @-@ icky .
both victims were almost completely drained of their blood .
less than a pint left .
he &apos;s exsanguinating them .
while they were still alive .
it might be utilitarian .
he needs them alive so they can pump out the blood themselves .
draining a body like that is extremely hard to do .
once the heart stops pumping ,
it &apos;s difficult to continue to extract the blood .
so the question is , how is he doing it ?
oh , i wish you wouldn &apos;t have asked that
&apos;cause now i gotta show this picture .
there are large bore holes in the femoral artery of each victim .
our unsub could have medical knowledge .
it &apos;s possible .
we &apos;ll know more when we get there .
wheels up in 30 .
&quot; my blood alone remains . take it .
but do not make me suffer long . &quot;
marie antoinette .
why these two victims ?
he &apos;s crossed socioeconomic , race , and gender lines .
one white males in his 40s ,
a wealthy hedge fund manager .
and an african american female ,
just started college at san francisco state ,
worked several jobs just to get by .
yeah , but why drain the blood ?
is he doing it to torture the victims ?
or is it about the blood ?
might be a form of psychological torture .
while not necessarily painful ,
exsanguination does take time .
it could be a fetish for the blood and the bloodletting .
what about ...
drinking it ?
fritz haarmann , the vampire of hanover ,
killed many of his victims by biting through their throats .
this unsub used some sort of tubing device
to drain the blood from the femoral arteries .
there isn &apos;t any saliva on the wound .
just because there &apos;s no bite marks
doesn &apos;t mean we should rule out vampirism .
bad news , crime @-@ fighters .
police just found another body wrapped in plastic
on a park bench , drained of blood .
i &apos;m gonna assume there &apos;s not two creeps
in the area doing the same thing ?
garcia , will you tell san francisco p.d.
we &apos;ll meet them at the crime scene ?
consider them told .
dave , you and blake meet the detectives at the crime scene .
morgan , go see the medical examiner ,
and jj and i will set up at the police station .
we &apos;ll talk to the families ,
see if we can find a connection .
detective .
ssa rossi .
this is ssa blake .
detective lenny miles .
it &apos;s great to have you guys here .
so the victim &apos;s name is lynn stevens .
she &apos;s drained , just like the last two ,
but there &apos;s something new .
new ?
he &apos;s removed her eyelids .
i don &apos;t even want to take a guess
as to why someone would do that .
there &apos;s excessive blood around the eyes .
he did this antemortem .
his sadism is evolving .
and his torture is definitely
more than psychological at this point .
i just don &apos;t understand why someone would do this .
it &apos;s all still so hard to believe .
i just need to ask you a few questions about your husband .
pammy was a great girl . you know ?
really friendly .
she loved everyone , and everyone loved her .
and you two had worked together
the night that she was abducted ?
he called me .
he said he was on his way home from work .
he just needed to stop off and close up a deal .
he didn &apos;t have anything in his schedule for that night .
do you have any idea what that deal was ?
after work , she said she always liked to go on long walks .
she was always going on about the architecture ,
how it &apos;s nothing like oregon .
she had just moved to san francisco ?
are there any other friends of hers that you know
who we should talk to ?
she was paying her way through school .
when she wasn &apos;t there , she was always at another job .
just trying to stay afloat . you know ?
if you think of anything else ,
please , don &apos;t hesitate to call .
if these victims are connected , i can &apos;t see it .
it &apos;s got to be about the blood .
yeah , but even that &apos;s different .
gary was a @-@ positive , pam was o @-@ neg .
we just got the lab report
back on the latest victim , lynn stevens .
she was ab @-@ negative .
maybe these are just victims of opportunity .
well , it &apos;s possible the unsub
abducted pamela on one of her routine walks .
he could have lured gary
with the promise of a lucrative money deal .
hi . i &apos;m aimee .
nice place .
ok , so it &apos;s going to be 75 for the hour .
anything more than that we can discuss .
all right ?
someplace where i can get changed ?
there .
i don &apos;t know which positions you want me in ,
but i &apos;m very flexible .
what &apos;s up , baby girl ?
i &apos;m worried about reid .
i am , too .
what do you think he &apos;s doing ?
i think he &apos;s taking the time that hotch gave him .
i get it . he &apos;s sad . he should be sad .
but i &apos;m so worried .
and when someone i love is hurting ,
it &apos;s like i hurt , too , which i know is super codependent ,
but it &apos;s just how i roll ,
and i feel like i should be doing something ,
and i don &apos;t know what it is , but--
all right , slow down , all right ? just slow down .
could you call him ?
i have . he &apos;s just not ready to talk to anybody right now .
i need to hear his voice . it &apos;s impairing my ability to work .
let me try something , all right ?
thanks .
hello . this is spencer reid . please leave a message .
hey , reid , it &apos;s derek . listen , i got a work question for you .
the unsub &apos;s exsanguinating victims
and removing their eyelids antemortem .
does that mean anything to you ? hit me back .
here &apos;s the information you called about .
thank you .
excuse me for a second .
what &apos;s up , reid ?
have the cornea or pupils been harmed in any way ?
no , no . blake said it looked like
a very sharp instrument was used .
if he &apos;s taking care not to damage the eyes ,
then line of sight is probably what &apos;s important to him .
so this guy wants them to see what he &apos;s doing .
hey , reid . how are you ?
i gotta go .
sorry about that .
not a problem .
cause of death would definitely be exsanguination .
but the tox screen showed high levels of--
say this 5 times fast-- ethylene diamine tetra acetic .
edta . it &apos;s an anti @-@ coagulant .
used mostly to treat heart conditions .
so the unsub probably used it to thin the blood .
the ketamine we found may have helped as well .
in humans , it tends to elevate blood pressure .
which is how he &apos;s sedating them .
if he knew that he was giving these drugs to these victims
and he ingested the blood ?
he &apos;d be dosing himself as well .
well , that rules out vampirism .
is there any chance this guy works in the medical field ?
i doubt it . there are a few hesitation marks near the wound ,
and the hole in the artery shows a lot of bruising around it .
i &apos;d say it &apos;s amateur at best .
all right , so we got an unsub
who &apos;s picking his victims at random ,
sedates them , then bleeds them dry .
if he &apos;s not drinking the blood ,
what the hell is he doing with it ?
wait ...
wait ...
shh , shh , shh . be still .
what &apos;s--what-- what are you doing ?
wait--wait--aah !
well , we got a hit off the prints .
the victim &apos;s name is aimee fortner .
it &apos;s only been a day since his last kill .
well , this guy doesn &apos;t have a cool @-@ down period .
rigor hasn &apos;t set in yet .
i &apos;d say she was put here maybe an hour ago ,
just after sunrise .
he &apos;s getting brazen .
it &apos;s his first daytime disposal .
well , this part of the park &apos;s not very well traveled .
the city &apos;s been trying to renovate every couple of years ,
but you know--politics .
so the unsub is familiar enough with the area
to know nobody would disturb him .
office of omnipotence . how may i dazzle you ?
garcia , i need information on the latest victim , aimee fortner .
information is my favorite way to dazzle , sir .
so sparkly .
here we go aimee crystal fortner .
originally from santa clara .
she was super pretty .
when she wasn &apos;t bartending ,
she supplemented her income by modeling .
a model ?
yes . and she &apos;s got a website
full of very artistic pictures of herself .
girl was not afraid to flaunt what god gave her at all .
uh @-@ huh . thanks , garcia .
what are you thinking ?
reid told morgan line of sight
was important to the unsub .
we should take a look at the other crime scenes .
i might know what he &apos;s doing with the blood .
we believe that this unsub is a white male
in his 20s or 30s ,
and he thinks of himself as a painter or an artist .
the placement of the victims tells us a lot about who he is .
pamela hurd was found near a painting done by
little known san francisco artist henry floyd .
gary porter was posed near a piece of graffiti art
by a street artist named cypher ,
who is currently wanted by the police .
and the third victim , lynn stevens , was found near a mural
painted by inner city youths .
finally , aimee fortner was placed near the statue of saint luke ,
patron saint of the artist .
this is a compulsion . it &apos;s not accidental .
he is obsessed with art .
all of the works of art are neglected , ignored , cast aside .
it &apos;s how he feels about himself .
we believe it &apos;s also the reason that he &apos;s evolved in
removing the victims &apos; eyelids .
he &apos;s forcing them to see what he sees .
there &apos;s no sexual component with these murders ,
but that &apos;s because the blood and the use of the blood
is his sexual release .
so , wait .
what--what is he doing with the blood ?
because he &apos;s so obsessed with art ,
we believe he &apos;s painting with it .
he has a quick kill pace .
more blood means more paint .
the more paintings he does ,
the greater the chance someone will recognize his work .
we think that because of his need for acceptance ,
he may be trying to sell the paintings .
so focus your canvassing on places
that might sell this kind of fringe art .
what &apos;s up , kid ?
if it is about the art ,
then it &apos;s clear the disposal sites are scattered
around the mission district area .
wait a minute . how did you know--
i had anderson bring over some of the files .
all right . all right , hold on a second . let me patch in garcia .
what have you heard ? is he ok ?
slow down . slow down .
reid .
garcia , you should pull a list
of all the art galleries in san francisco .
reid , i was just--
how are you ?
better .
thanks for asking .
and thanks for the baskets .
you know , nuts have magnesium , which helps produce--
serotonin . yeah . i know .
ok , galleries . i got a lot .
focus on the mission district .
i guess that &apos;s better than nothing .
it is . i will take it .
ok , there &apos;s still a few galleries , but it &apos;s more manageable .
i am sending the addresses to your mobile .
i got it . thanks , garcia .
yeah .
it &apos;s an original hellman .
he painted it while literally on his deathbed .
10,000 .
madison .
yeah ?
he &apos;s back .
the museum is ready to make me an offer .
perfect .
if you want , i can tell him to leave .
no , it &apos;s ok .
mrs. riley .
i think you &apos;ll be much more pleased with my piece this time .
yeah , um , like i told you the last time ,
i &apos;m not interested .
why not ?
well , because this type of art
is just not what we &apos;re looking for .
well , what is it you are looking for ?
look , i can see that you &apos;re getting better .
all i can tell you is it &apos;s a little simplistic .
look , every good artist leaves
a piece of himself on the canvas .
you have to find that one thing
that &apos;s going to set you apart from the rest of the crowd .
i used blood .
an unusual medium is not what i &apos;m talking about .
the world today doesn &apos;t make sense .
why should i paint pictures that do ?
picasso .
i &apos;m impressed .
if i find my signature ,
you &apos;ll consider me for the gallery ?
anything &apos;s possible .
yeah .
thank you .
can i help you ?
we &apos;re from the fbi .
you the owner ?
yeah . name &apos;s tre .
do you have any art on display where blood is used as a medium ?
no .
no , but there was a guy in here a couple days ago
who tried to sell me a piece like that .
it wasn &apos;t exactly my taste ,
but a customer of mine happened to be in here ,
saw it , fell in love with it , bought it on sight .
you think that could that be your guy ?
you wouldn &apos;t happen to have any security cameras in here , would you ?
no .
we need the customer &apos;s name if you &apos;ve got it .
yeah .
i never quite understood these things .
it all looks like the guy had a seizure while painting it .
it &apos;s emile hartford .
it &apos;s early 20th century .
his daughter died when she was 8 .
he said every time he painted , he &apos;d be able to see her .
don &apos;t know how you see anything in there .
i guess that &apos;s why they say art is in the eye of the beholder .
yeah .
you know what else is in the eye of the beholder ?
&apos;57 chevy i told you about last week ?
this morning , bam , it won &apos;t start .
now it &apos;s in the eye of my mechanic .
come on , man , are you gonna make me ask
or are you gonna be a friend and offer me a ride home ?
we &apos;re friends .
worked together for two years now . i &apos;d hope so .
you need a ride , paul ?
thought you &apos;d never ask .
the unsub sold his painting to this place ?
it reminds me of the eighties .
what ?
do i even want to know ?
probably .
welcome . my name is andre .
before we start , i &apos;ll need you to fill out a small waiver .
no , no , no . we &apos;re not a couple .
that &apos;s ok . we cater to all kinds of relationships .
well , uh , our relationship is with the fbi .
oh .
i run a clean establishment here .
clean , legal , adult fun .
calm down . we &apos;re just looking for a painting you bought recently .
you &apos;re gonna have to be a bit more specific .
i &apos;m a connoisseur of the dark and depraved arts .
i purchase a lot of paintings .
well , you bought this one a couple of days ago .
it &apos;s made with blood .
human blood .
like i said , i buy a lot of paintings .
i don &apos;t remember them all .
oh , really ? because last i checked ,
withholding evidence would make you an accomplice .
we just want to see the painting .
just want to see if it &apos;s from the guy we &apos;re looking for .
remembering now ?
possibly .
for that piece , you &apos;ll have to follow me to the spanking room .
i may have bought it , but i didn &apos;t realize
it was evidence of any sort .
is that that you &apos;re looking for ?
the tortured look in her eyes is what first drew me to it .
the guy was asking 1,500 for it .
i got him to take 250 , cash .
that &apos;s our first victim , pamela hurd .
it &apos;s definitely from our guy .
yeah , we &apos;re gonna need to take this .
what are you doing ?
what ...
what ...
what &apos;s going on ?
what--
no , please don &apos;t .
why ?
it &apos;s the only way .
sorry .
you &apos;re insane .
i guess every artist is a little crazy .
no , come on man , we &apos;re friends .
exactly .
it &apos;s what i &apos;ve been missing .
something personal .
i need you to hold still .
hold still .
hold still ...
hold still !
help !
no ! aah !
no !
no ... no !
well , we now have a piece of his art ,
but we still don &apos;t have anything to identify the unsub .
the lab &apos;s got a sample ,
but it &apos;s probably pamela hurd &apos;s blood .
master andre said he was an average white guy
in his late 20s to early 30s .
same thing the gallery owner said . he signed it .
yeah , it looks like a &quot; b &quot; something or something &quot; b. &quot;
i &apos;m going to have garcia compile a list of artists
with the letter &quot; b &quot; somewhere in their name .
it &apos;s not much , but it &apos;s something .
we got the report back from the lab .
they couldn &apos;t extract any dna from the painting .
they said something about there only being red blood cells .
hmm . he removed the white blood cells .
plasma .
why would he take the plasma ?
it would make it thicker . easier to use as a paint .
what type of equipment would it take to do that ?
you can easily buy a centrifuge online these days
for a couple hundred bucks .
what other reasons would he
have for separating the plasma from the blood ?
it &apos;s a habit .
reid .
spence .
i didn &apos;t expect you back this soon .
you sure you &apos;re ready ?
no , but i think i figured something out .
where &apos;s mrs. riley ?
you need to leave .
it &apos;s ok , alan , i &apos;ll handle it .
i did what you said .
this is my friend , paul .
i even used some of my own blood .
that &apos;s not what i meant .
but you said if i made it more personal ,
you &apos;d use me in your gallery .
look , i &apos;ve been trying to be nice and give you some encouragement ,
but i can see now that that &apos;s really not gonna help you .
so i think i just have to be blunt .
it &apos;s not good .
but ...
this is--
this is abstract .
i understand the concept ,
but splashing something onto a canvas ,
that doesn &apos;t make it art .
some people have it , some people don &apos;t .
you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
maybe not , but that still doesn &apos;t mean that i &apos;m gonna buy this .
but you said--
look , i don &apos;t know how to explain this to you any better .
there is a difference between a dream and a talent .
look , i &apos;m sorry .
if there &apos;s someone that you--
he &apos;s a hemophiliac .
that would explain his obsession with blood .
he can &apos;t bleed without a fear of dying .
it &apos;s also why he would separate the plasma from the blood
before painting with it .
it &apos;s an antiquated treatment ,
but some hemophiliacs can inject plasma into their wounds ,
kick @-@ starting the clotting
process that &apos;s ineffective in their own systems .
talk about it .
hey , girlie , i need a list of hemophiliacs in san francisco .
vague . so vague . ok .
garcia , for his obsession to be this profound ,
he most likely has the more severe version of the disease .
it &apos;s type b christmas disease .
reid , i &apos;m happy to hear you made it safe and sound .
thank you , garcia .
ok , christmas disease . it does not sound very jolly .
it was named after the first known case ,
stephen christmas .
all right , i got 15 people who have trouble clotting .
he wouldn &apos;t stray too far from the art world .
most likely works in and
around the art community , but not as an artist .
and he &apos;s a loner . so look for people with jobs
where they don &apos;t interact with the public .
yeah . yeah . i got 3 .
stock boy at a local supermarket , an art blogger ,
and a custodian .
the victims have different blood types .
if he &apos;s taking the plasma out of the blood ,
he must be a universal recipient .
any of them with ab @-@ positive blood ?
specificity . i dig it .
ok , if i factor in those &quot; b &quot; names i was working on ...
and bingo is his name @-@ o .
actually , his name is bryan hughes .
he is an ab @-@ positive hemophiliac
who works as a janitor at the bay area museum of art ,
and before you ask , yes ,
his address has been sent to your phones .
you &apos;re the best , baby girl .
dave , you and blake take the museum .
the rest of us will take the residence .
i &apos;m ok .
yeah . but it &apos;s good to see you .
you really don &apos;t need to be here if you &apos;re not ready .
this is going to take time .
how much time ?
it &apos;s hard to say .
but we &apos;re all here for you .
thank you .
hey , what you got , mama ?
a compelling piece of information about this bryan hughes .
3 weeks before the first murder ,
he was involved in a car accident .
was he injured ?
uh , no . and if you were looking at the pictures i am
you would say that is a miracle .
it may have given him the impression he couldn &apos;t be hurt .
the other driver was hurt . she bled to death .
hughes called 911,
failed to mention there was another driver involved .
by the time emergency crews got there , she had already died .
thanks , garcia .
watching the other woman bleed to death
must have been the trigger .
hey , what you got , pretty boy ?
i think hughes may have his next victim .
an alan archer just came in and reported his boss missing .
madison riley owns an art gallery in the mission district .
said there was blood , signs of a struggle .
hughes even left a painting of his on the wall this time .
it &apos;s the same signature and it &apos;s definitely made of blood ,
which got me thinking about maeve &apos;s stalker .
if this guy &apos;s a tortured artist searching for approval ,
in his mind there may be only one way to get it .
suicide .
thanks , reid .
i put my heart and my soul into those paintings .
you &apos;re going to get a first @-@ hand look at what i &apos;m capable of creating .
bryan hughes , fbi .
no ! i have to make her see .
put down the knife .
bryan , i understand .
no , you don &apos;t .
how could you possibly understand ?
because i &apos;ve seen your work .
and i know you may not be appreciated now ,
but i promise you , if you put down the knife ,
i will make sure that people see your art ,
and no one will be able to ignore it .
it &apos;s all i want . i deserve that .
then put down the knife , and let &apos;s figure this out .
you know how many paintings van gogh sold before he died ?
bryan , don &apos;t do it .
two .
he sold two .
don &apos;t make us do this .
i gotta make you see me .
get the emts upstairs .
we &apos;ve got another body over here .
well , i counted 5 baskets .
7 , but i think ms. cavanaugh next door
may have taken a couple .
i &apos;m really sorry if i &apos;ve been kind of ...
spence . you don &apos;t ...
kid .
i didn &apos;t mean for you to come all the way out there .
i know .
listen , if you need anything at all ,
you just have to ask .
actually , if you guys don &apos;t mind ,
i could use some help with something .
name it .
&quot; sometimes the hardest part isn &apos;t letting go ,
but rather , learning to start over . &quot;
