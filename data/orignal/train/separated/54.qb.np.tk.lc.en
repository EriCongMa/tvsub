i &apos;m sorry i &apos;m late ; traffic was crazy .
peter wanted me to check out this house
on my way in to work , so , please ?
no , wait . i just wanted to warn you :
the press might call .
wendy scott @-@ carr &apos;s husband is doing
his spousal interview with kids .
we discussed this , eli ; i &apos;m not gonna do an interview .
i know . i @-@ i didn &apos;t say anything .
i &apos;m just saying , you might get a call .
i &apos;m going now .
no , wait .
you and the kids are coming
to the hyra tomorrow night for the returns , right ?
i am .
not the kids ?
good @-@ bye , eli .
it &apos;s a four @-@ bedroom , five @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half @-@ bath
1933 colonial revival .
stanley myers interior .
beautiful , isn &apos;t it ?
it is .
you have to see the formal dining room .
original hardwood floors .
2.4 million , but i &apos;m pretty sure i can get them down to 2.1 .
it &apos;s a quiet neighborhood , close to very good schools ,
public and private .
it &apos;s a divorce , so they &apos;re very motivated .
so the vote &apos;s tomorrow , huh ?
mrs. state &apos;s attorney .
sorry , is that jinxing it ?
excuse me a moment .
alicia florrick .
mrs. florrick , hello .
this is andrew wiley .
i &apos;m an investigator with the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s office .
i &apos;m a little busy , mr ...
wiley .
i won &apos;t keep you .
i just need to ask you
a few questions about my investigation .
i was told that investigation was concluded , mr. wiley .
yeah , well , the kalinda sharma investigation was concluded .
this is a new one .
uh , when can we talk ?
well , i &apos;m ...
that &apos;s my call @-@ waiting .
why don &apos;t you-- i &apos;ll have my assistant call .
okay . when ?
soon .
alicia florrick .
hello , mrs. florrick .
uh , it &apos;s natalie flores .
um , i &apos;m the intern you hired for the month .
the one with the immigration trouble who worked
as a nanny for wendy scott @-@ carr and @-@ and was fired after ...
i know , natalie . what &apos;s up ?
your husband wanted you to look at the study .
through there .
maybe nothing . uh , or something .
i @-@ i don &apos;t know the protocol here .
look , natalie , i &apos;m a little busy .
i &apos;m sorry .
uh , th @-@ this contract you asked me
to translate for the deposition today--
i was looking at the 2007 extension ...
it &apos;s not the extension .
we already had that translated .
i wanted the side letter translated .
never mind . um , i &apos;ll just wait till you get here .
it &apos;s probably nothing .
no , i &apos;m sorry , natalie .
it &apos;s been a crazy morning . what is it ?
well , i @-@ i know i &apos;m just an intern here ,
and i really don &apos;t want to get anyone in trouble ,
but i think your translator mistranslated it .
that &apos;s my call @-@ waiting .
i &apos;ll be right in .
alicia florrick .
alicia , sorry to bother you at home ,
but can you come in early ? we have a problem .
sure .
the deposition ?
no , the client . he had a heart attack .
what ? !
his daughter &apos;s here--
aida .
oh , my god .
when ?
last night .
she says he &apos;s conscious ; he &apos;s out of the icu ,
but he wants us to continue with the depositions .
he want ... ? how ?
that &apos;s what we &apos;re trying to figure out now .
so can you come in ?
sure . her father always said this was a cursed suit .
eh , there &apos;s no such thing .
but don &apos;t say it ,
because it &apos;s unlucky .
i &apos;ll see you in 20 minutes .
i thought of you .
it &apos;s like your old house .
you ever miss it ?
my old house ?
sometimes .
well , this one is better .
i have to go .
you haven &apos;t even seen upstairs .
i &apos;ll come back .
it is tempting .
what &apos;s wrong with being tempted ?
it was hard .
i won &apos;t lie .
these flyers tried to make our love ugly .
and then our daughters were the ones to bring them home .
did it make you cry , elisa ?
yeah , i guess ,
but mom and dad explained it to me .
oh , my god , we &apos;re screwed .
you &apos;ve had a strong marriage for over decade now , spencer .
what do you think of the troubles in the florrick marriage ?
oh , dear god almighty .
i think any marriage that stays together
is to be respected , admired .
every marriage needs some space .
we got to do some polling .
no .
we got to get florrick &apos;s wife to do the interview .
she won &apos;t .
i don &apos;t think you get it , eli .
or she doesn &apos;t .
you &apos;re in a race that &apos;s tied with one day to go ,
and he just hit a home run for his wife .
alicia florrick doesn &apos;t have the luxury to say no ,
and you don &apos;t have the luxury to protect her .
i &apos;m not protecting her .
i promised her i would not ask her to do this .
oh , my god , you promised her .
well , why didn &apos;t you just say that ?
i &apos;ll be ready in a minute , andre .
i have to get this to my boss .
we have better health care , too .
canada has the best health care in the world .
i like it here , andre .
i like the u.s. i &apos;ll be right back .
just come look at montreal .
america is dying !
show me as we walk .
they do bilingual contracts--
one in english , one in spanish .
they &apos;re supposed to be identical .
but they &apos;re not . look .
alicia .
then , on page five ...
aida .
he &apos;s all right .
what happened ?
he was looking through their stock reports ,
trying to find things to refute them .
and then i told him that he should stop ,
that he should rest for today .
and then he just blacked out .
i drove him to the hospital .
well , you should be there with him , aida .
no .
he insisted i be here in his place .
he wants me to phone him every hour , with updates .
this isn &apos;t just about the money anymore , alicia .
oh , i @-@ i &apos;m sorry .
natalie flores . this is aida rios .
oh , hello .
excuse me .
hello ?
can you stay for the rest of the day ?
me ?
yes .
you know what , just show this to a paralegal .
um , no , no , no , i @-@ i can stay .
i just , i just have to tell my boyfriend .
great .
aida , i &apos;m so sorry .
your dad is a tough old cuss .
he &apos;ll be up and around in no time .
thank you .
and thank you , mr. francis ,
for agreeing to be deposed .
after a year , i thought we &apos;d never see you .
then perhaps you should use your time more fruitfully .
thank you , isabel .
so your company , platacostillman ,
made how much in profits last year , mr. francis ?
domestic and worldwide : 6.7 billion .
the oil business is proving to be quite
lucrative these days , huh ?
and how much did you pay luis rios and his company ,
latin star drilling ?
i think you can read the documents , mr. gardner .
you &apos;re right , isabel , i can .
zero .
and how much did the contract
specify you owed my client ?
if latin star drilling
fulfilled its contractual duties-- 86 million .
and what were the contractual duties of aida &apos;s father ?
the contractual duties of latin star drilling
were to set up and operate oil rigs in venezuela .
which he did .
not in the time specified .
his company promised to deliver in may 2008,
they delivered in september .
four months late ?
that &apos;s correct .
now , your brazilian facility manager
finished his rig eight months late .
nigerian contractor finished a year late .
and yet ... you paid both .
yes .
we had agreements allowing for a late delivery .
agreements ? good .
where are they ?
handshake agreements .
oh , i @-@ i thought you were joking .
didn &apos;t the reason you refused to pay aida &apos;s father ...
no , stay for this .
... have nothing to do with the contract
and everything to do with
the changing political climate in venezuela ?
no .
but you closed your offices in caracas in 2008 , claiming
&quot; the socialist policies of the current president ,
hugo chavez , have proven
unfriendly to american businesses . &quot;
and one week later ,
you refused to pay my client &apos;s
venezuelan subsidiary .
now , it looks to me
like you wanted to get out of venezuela ,
and you decided to skip on the bill .
&quot; looks to me &quot; ?
is that one of those new @-@ fangled legal terms ?
mr. francis , the contracts with our client
were executed in both spanish and english ; is that correct ?
it is .
you speak spanish , don &apos;t you , sir ?
i do , fluently .
um , what does the word &quot; exito &quot; mean ?
it means &quot; success . &quot;
and yet it is often mistranslated as &quot; exit , &quot; isn &apos;t it ?
and &quot; exit &quot; is sometimes mistranslated as &quot; exito &quot;
probably because both words sound so alike .
thank you , rosetta stone .
what do you have ?
here , in the u.s. copy , it reads &quot; exit strategy . &quot;
and here , in the supposedly identical spanish copy ,
&quot; exit strateg &quot; &quot; is translated as &quot; estrategia de exito &quot;
&quot; success strategy &quot; &quot;
that is such utter b ... !
the delivery side @-@ letter is now void because our client
never agreed to the terms of your &quot; exit &quot; delivery date .
that is a technicality !
he knew what he was signing !
give us an hour .
dad laughed .
he was sitting up in bed .
he knows we still have a long haul ?
he does .
it &apos;s just the first time i &apos;ve heard him laugh
in a long time .
good job , alicia .
actually , it was ...
what &apos;s going on ?
you know , politics is just as challenging as acting .
也是美剧 《 法律与秩序 》 的主演
always has been .
what &apos;s really hard is fly @-@ fishing .
well , hello there .
you must be , uh ...
will gardner .
right , right .
glad to meet you .
gardner / lockhart .
actually , it &apos;s lockhart / gardner .
are you here to see diane ?
uh , no . here to see you .
me ? really ?
well ...
i &apos;m here .
why are you here to see me ?
well , i hate to say it , will , but , uh , i &apos;m replacing you .
the platacostillman suit .
i &apos;m the new plaintiff &apos;s attorney .
aida , what &apos;s going on ?
your dad &apos;s firing me ?
what ?
he &apos;s hired an actor ?
i &apos;m not just an actor , will .
i practiced law for 42 years .
just like that , he &apos;s firing me ?
he &apos;s not firing you , will .
he &apos;s no longer the plaintiff .
over here , boys .
this is the consul general of venezuela .
and this is , uh , somebody else-- can &apos;t remember his name .
but , uh , they &apos;re representative
of the venezuelan oil industry .
and your client &apos;s oil facility has just been nationalized .
oh , no .
sorry to have to do this ,
but , you know , venezuela is a socialist country ,
and they &apos;ve just nationalized latin star &apos;s drilling subsidiary .
so that means you &apos;re no longer the plaintiff , ma &apos;am ,
and you &apos;re no longer the plaintiff &apos;s counsel .
they are ,
and i am .
so thank you very much .
we &apos;ll take over from here .
not to sound too melodramatic ...
but over my dead body .
well , not to sound equally melodramatic ,
but , uh , let &apos;s dance .
you don &apos;t understand . they pulled within a point ,
and that &apos;s within the margin of error .
no , you don &apos;t understand .
we just went from a case we were winning
to a case that isn &apos;t even ours .
i know , and i told you i would never ask you
to do an on @-@ screen interview .
and for nine months , i haven &apos;t ,
but we need you .
peter needs you .
to ask once is still to ask .
i know , but i promise i &apos;ll never ask again and ...
because the election is tomorrow ,
and so even if i wanted to , there isn &apos;t time .
wendy scott @-@ carr &apos;s husband did the spousal interview ,
and now they have the momentum .
and it &apos;s not just about him giving the interview .
it &apos;s about you not .
don &apos;t put this on my shoulders , eli .
it is on your shoulders .
peter &apos;s indiscretions are out front because you won &apos;t speak .
i agreed to leave you out of the politics
because you didn &apos;t want to comment ,
but now your absence is the comment .
that &apos;s not fair .
of course , it &apos;s not fair . politics is not fair .
is that ... ?
yes .
why .... ?
do you really want to know ?
alicia , you ... you don &apos;t want to think three days from now
that you cost peter the election .
wow . you are really laying it on .
i believe in peter .
peter will be better than wendy scott @-@ carr .
why ?
because she is more idealistic than practical ,
and the world chews up idealistic people .
peter will not be chewed up .
all i need is two hours this afternoon . that &apos;s all .
eli , even if i wanted to , i work .
this case has been bubbling along for a year .
it &apos;s here . i can &apos;t abandon it--
especially when the client is in the hospital
and venezuela is trying to steal it .
i &apos;m sorry .
how are you doing here ?
good . i love alicia .
thank you for making this work .
oh , no .
they &apos;re the ones who needed you .
how &apos;s your father doing ?
he &apos;s working on his citizenship .
uh , we &apos;re testing each other .
did you know there are 27 amendments to the constitution ?
i did hear something about it .
uh , i have to go .
oh . come tomorrow night .
we &apos;re having a party for the candidate--
if we win , i mean .
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s a good idea , but thank you .
i have to work .
i &apos;ll see you tonight ?
so you are mr. gold ?
do i know you ?
i am andre .
i &apos;m natalie &apos;s boyfriend .
she said she met a mr. gold . that is you ?
yes . it is me .
we &apos;re in love .
okay .
you &apos;re older than she is .
am i missing something here ?
i &apos;m just talking .
that &apos;s all .
and i &apos;m going .
this is absurd .
venezuela just nationalized our case ?
they nationalized latin star &apos;s venezuelan subsidiary ,
so they claim they have the case .
should i tell my dad ?
i &apos;m just worried how he &apos;ll react .
i wouldn &apos;t yet . it &apos;s not certain they can do this .
and our options ?
we fight it-- federal court .
or we delay it .
how ?
natalie ?
go ahead .
uh , i ... well , the thing is , um ,
hugo chavez tried to nationalize cemex ,
a venezuelan cement company ,
but they sued successfully
for a delay to have a fair market value assessed .
okay , and how do we know this ?
well , when i shorted cemex
on the caracas exchange , i took a bath .
won &apos;t be doing that again .
i &apos;m sorry . who are you again ?
natalie flores .
you hired me as a temp , but i was a day trader before that ,
so if you ever want me to manage your money ...
that was a joke .
not the part about the day @-@ trading-- that was real .
we hired natalie for a few weeks to help her with her citizenship .
tell them about cemex-- what the assessment did .
right . well , it bought cemex time .
time to bargain for a better deal .
so we delay
and try to make a deal with platacostillman ?
makes sense .
they &apos;d rather make a deal with us
than hugo chavez anyway .
good job .
uh , mrs. florrick , andrew wiley .
oh , yes .
my assistant was going to give you a call .
yeah , i decided to save her the trouble .
well , i &apos;m a little busy .
um , just quickly , ma &apos;am .
i @-@ i @-@ i &apos;m not here for childs .
i @-@ i &apos;m ... i &apos;m following up on an interview
given to one of our asas
by an investigator here , a blake calamar .
oh , yes . blake no longer works here .
yeah , i @-@ i @-@ i know .
but , um , you see , some of the pages from his interview are ... are gone ,
and , uh , i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m trying to hunt down what he said .
don &apos;t you think you should be talking to blake ? if you &apos;ll excuse me ...
unfortunately , i can &apos;t .
i @-@ i hit a dead end , and i don &apos;t like dead ends ,
and i was hoping that you could help me understand
why blake was talking about you .
me ?
yeah .
you see , i found a small portion of the preliminary notes ,
and the subject line for the interview is listed as &quot; alicia florrick . &quot;
so i was wondering if you knew what he might be discussing .
no , i don &apos;t .
you &apos;re sure ?
i have to go .
so we &apos;re not going to handle this like gentlemen ?
actually , i think this is how gentlemen handle it .
we just filed a suit
contesting the venezuelan nationalizing of latin star
until the world bank &apos;s icsid
assesses a value for the company .
no , no , no . strike three , birdie . you struck out .
i &apos;m sorry , mr. president . did you have something to add ?
my spanish may be a little rusty ,
but i think president chavez disagrees .
tell them , da . you &apos;re the da . you tell them .
no , no . i told you , now . i &apos;m not an actual da .
i , uh , did impersonate one on tv .
在 《 情枭的黎明 》 里出演律师
phone sean penn . phone him .
the president would like for you to understand that , uh ,
he is now the ... sole owner of latin star ,
and has rechristened it ...
the , uh , love drilling and oil company .
uh , &quot; the americans again want my oil .
they thirst for it . all americans . &quot;
金球奖提名女演员
&quot; except courtney love . not her . &quot;
&quot; even now , she is not appreciated in her country .
where is her academy award ? where ? &quot;
uh , thank you , mr. president .
president chavez has thanked you for your service ,
and he &apos;s just asking that you step back , uh , from the case .
yes , the only problem is , the law of his own country
requires a three @-@ month period
to assess the value of our client &apos;s company .
he &apos;s changing the law .
what ?
the enabling law of 2008 .
the venezuelan national assembly voted
to give the president the power to change law
if it protected the interests of venezuela .
oh , my god .
it &apos;s like being in a woody allen movie .
have it ready by 1 : 00 for court .
you , too .
good job .
thank you .
oh , alicia , do you have a moment ?
so who am i negotiating with here-- you or venezuela ?
we &apos;re going to court right now to find out .
unfortunately , you lost your window , mr. gardner .
platacostillman is a very busy company , so ...
why don &apos;t we pencil in a time for depositions in ,
uh , 2012 ?
you mean after you &apos;ve bankrupted my client ?
no , we &apos;re going to continue these depositions this afternoon .
you &apos;re not going to be ready this afternoon .
we &apos;re going to be ready this afternoon .
you know , we have other ways to attack this .
contractual law is just so bloodless , don &apos;t you think ?
see you this afternoon .
take the afternoon off .
excuse me ?
go ahead . take the afternoon off .
you deserve it .
i ... uh , thank you ,
but this is my case-- i &apos;m committed .
i know , and you can continue with it tomorrow .
we &apos;ll be fine in court .
this isn &apos;t a punishment .
we just ... we have too many voices right now ,
so take a break for a few hours .
this afternoon ?
yes .
who talked to you ?
who talked to me ?
yes .
did eli call ?
alicia , take the afternoon off .
come back tomorrow for the depositions .
hey , alicia . how are you ? you sound a little ...
this is my life , eli .
you don &apos;t meddle with my life .
okay , alicia . what &apos;s wrong ?
i &apos;ve been working on this case for over a year now ,
and you do this ?
well , you can forget it . i &apos;m not doing the interview .
and i don &apos;t care if peter blames me for the rest of his life .
and as i understand it , you &apos;re asking for an emergency injunction .
yes , your honor .
we were in the midst of a settlement negotiation with platacostillman ,
and in our opinion ,
venezuela has no standing in this suit .
no , we would agree that the president of venezuela
has the power to change laws in his country ,
but in our opinion , those powers should not
impact a lawsuit in this country .
the president hasn &apos;t changed the laws
of the united states , your honor .
he &apos;s changed the laws of venezuela ,
and they just happen to impact a lawsuit here .
was that in your opinion ?
excuse me ?
your opinion .
you were expressing your opinion , right ?
i don &apos;t know , uh , what you &apos;re getting at .
your honor ?
it is just such an honor to have you in my court , sir .
oh , it &apos;s my honor , your honor .
you don &apos;t know how many young people
you encourage with your show .
oh , thank you , but , uh ,
it would probably be a mistake to call it my show .
and so humble .
i must say , you ... you look taller in person .
well , now , you &apos;re embarrassing me , ma &apos;am .
just one woman &apos;s opinion .
your honor , just quickly--
this case is not about the opposing counsel .
it &apos;s about his client , president hugo chavez .
i would disagree .
it &apos;s about the rule of law in venezuela .
you mean the new rule of law .
this law was changed a half hour ago , your honor--
in my opinion-- and as such , it is a ex post facto law .
unfortunately , mr. gardner ,
ms. lockhart , i am a judge in chicago .
i have no jurisdiction over venezuelan law .
i do understand your argument for emergency relief ,
so i will freeze latin star &apos;s assets until ...
your honor , it has taken us a year
to get platacostillman to the negotiations table .
our @-@ our client has had a heart attack
due to the drawn @-@ out nature of this fight .
a freeze would not be in the interests of latin star
or the venezuelan people , your honor .
then i would suggest that you align your interests
against platacostillman .
you both have reason to want a fair settlement .
in my opinion , the best result would be for you ,
mr. gardner , ms. lockhart ,
to represent president chavez in this lawsuit , too .
and thank you , sir ,
for doing all you &apos;ve done to inspire the youth of america .
great .
we have a dictator for a client .
well , here we are .
i &apos;m glad your client finds this funny .
what is he saying ?
he likes your dress .
oh , how nice .
you know , this doesn &apos;t have to be bad .
there are certain advantages to being on the same side .
such as ?
well , it appears everyone has kissed and made up .
can we continue ?
yes . and we &apos;d like to add a name to the witness list .
a juan perez .
and who might this be ?
well , he &apos;s the director of the venezuelan interior .
ah , a present from president chavez . how nice .
and what might mr. perez swear to ?
he &apos;ll swear that your client , the ceo of platacostillman ,
admitted cheating latin star out of its fee .
really ?
my goodness , what a revelation .
mr. gardner , i guess dictatorship has its privileges .
you can always make a deal .
well , we have four names
that we would like to add to the witness list .
remember when i told you we had other ways to attack this ?
how could i forget ?
well , platacostillman doesn &apos;t owe latin star a cent--
i &apos;m sorry , a red cent .
because our boilerplate
charges prevent us from compensating companies
that commit human rights violations .
oh , come on .
these four men will testify to life @-@ threatening conditions
that they personally witnessed
on the latin star rigs in venezuela .
my father says his rigs have a perfect safety record .
not a single violation or infraction .
i need you to look into these four witnesses .
any direction ?
we reached a stalemate with platacostillman .
they &apos;re lying about human rights violations .
find out why .
hey , why weren &apos;t you in there ?
i thought you were on platacostillman .
i &apos;m on leave .
leave ?
just for the afternoon .
do you know an andrew wiley ?
at the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s office ?
the investigator . yeah , he works with cary .
he was asking about a last interview blake did ;
a last interview where he talked about me .
did cary mention this ?
no .
probably the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s last gasp .
yes , an attempt to intimidate me .
alicia .
yeah ?
i need to ...
can we talk sometime ?
whenever you want .
i &apos;m on leave .
alicia , there you are .
is everything okay ?
oh , yeah . i just--
i &apos;m on something else this afternoon .
how &apos;s your dad ?
good .
i had to tell him about hugo chavez &apos;s involvement .
he was confused .
yeah , i am , too .
would you excuse me a moment ?
sure .
thank you , diane .
ah , mrs. florrick .
i don &apos;t think we &apos;ve ever met .
frank landau .
hello .
we &apos;re all rooting for your husband , ma &apos;am .
take care . nice to meet you .
diane , sorry , just quickly ...
yes , i thought you were taking the afternoon off .
i am . i just ...
was that the chairman of the democratic committee ?
uh , yes .
frank . an old friend .
he was worried we were representing
hugo chavez these days .
he was the one who asked you to give me the afternoon off ?
i wish you wouldn &apos;t worry about it , alicia .
it &apos;s not a punishment .
i know , but frank landau asked you , didn &apos;t he ?
thank you .
this is mr. carlos santos ,
a worker on the latin star oil rig ,
and recent immigrator to america .
mr. santos , nice to meet you ?
it &apos;s a worker , mr. president .
a man named carlos santos .
so you say you witnessed
human rights abuses
on the oil rigs in venezuela , mr. santos ?
mr. santos ?
i have been awarded the al @-@ gaddafi international prize
for human rights by colonel gaddafi .
i would never stand for human rights
violations in my country . never .
so tell this santos he is lying .
do you refute that , mr. santos ?
do you have family still in venezuela , mr. santos ?
si .
a wife and two kids .
so you would like to change your testimony too ,
mr. pulito ?
i guess you have family in venezuela , too ?
no , no , wait , kalinda .
you don &apos;t need to look into three of the workers .
they recanted .
just one of them is testifying .
he doesn &apos;t have family in venezuela .
which one ?
okay , got it .
hey .
i need help with just one of the names .
esteban gonzales .
walk with me . share your troubles .
cary , what &apos;s going on with your investigator wiley ?
my investigator ? i don &apos;t know . why ?
he approached alicia .
he doesn &apos;t know .
i know , but he approached alicia .
i can &apos;t stop him .
the more i try to stop him , the harder he digs .
i have to talk to her .
yeah , that &apos;s a hard one .
by the way , i slept with your husband .
oh , sorry , is that too blunt ?
it was before we met .
okay , well , then maybe she &apos;ll understand .
you know what ? it &apos;s my turn .
before you talk to alicia about your ... issue ,
ask her to smooth things over for me with peter .
what ? you &apos;re always asking me for favors .
this is mine .
if peter is elected , i don &apos;t want to be summarily fired
because there &apos;s bad blood between us .
so you &apos;re going to stay at the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s office ?
i like it there .
but don &apos;t tell her you slept with peter
before you put in a good word for me , okay ?
uh , i gotta go .
mrs. florrick , hello .
peter isn &apos;t here .
i &apos;m sorry . i thought it was you .
what was me ?
i was excused from work for the afternoon by diane ,
and i thought you were the one who arranged it .
no , never .
i know .
it was frank landau .
sorry .
he &apos;s a little ... worried .
i know .
i &apos;ll do it .
it ?
the interview .
if it &apos;s not too late .
sorry .
it &apos;s my decision .
then thank you .
the witness , esteban gonzales ,
was indeed injured in a oil rig accident .
there are hospital records in both venezuela and chicago .
it &apos;s untrue . my dad said ...
it &apos;s not from your dad &apos;s oil rig .
now the hospital records show
that he had salt water in his lungs when he was admitted .
which is odd ... because all the latin star rigs are land @-@ based .
it was offshore drilling .
yep . and you know who has offshore rigs ?
platacostillman .
well , looks like we have something
to discuss with our adversaries .
it &apos;s a performance , a show , and you &apos;re the wife .
i know , i know .
but people don &apos;t listen , they watch .
and they want to see you at ease , calm , loving .
so ...
do you forgive peter ?
i think peter is my husband ; he &apos;s the father of my children ;
and i watch him every day ,
trying to make amends for his past mistakes .
so that &apos;s a no ?
no , it &apos;s a yes .
good .
thank you .
is it true ?
did it sound true ?
do you know peter slept with amber madison
on 18 separate occasions ?
she &apos;s gunning for you on that .
i do know that .
does that bother you ?
does it bother me ? it horrifies me .
okay , okay , a little less .
but peter and i discussed it .
it was a difficult time in our marriage .
peter was at work so much , and i was at home .
a marriage needs constant attention ,
and we allowed our attention to flag .
good .
so why will it be different this time if peter is elected ?
because peter has seen the inside of a prison cell .
he &apos;s found an enduring faith .
and he &apos;s seen the hurt he &apos;s done to his children .
good . tell me about your children .
how have they handled it ?
they &apos;re ...
they &apos;re the best people i know .
i love them more ...
i would do anything to see them not hurt .
they love their father ,
and they have stood by him throughout .
good .
emotional , but not too ...
so , tell me about your work .
do you worry your work takes you away from your children ?
i do .
but i needed to work to support my family .
so will you stop working when he &apos;s elected ?
no .
i care about my work ,
i care about my clients ,
and i think that
my children support what i do .
you think ?
yes .
you have to be more definitive .
any anecdotes with the kids that you can relate ?
no , that is definitive enough .
okay .
good .
let her come off as the bully .
the viewers want her to ask the tough questions ,
then they feel guilty and start blaming her .
so just stay ... cool . and real .
we &apos;re ready for you now .
we &apos;ll be right there .
thank you , alicia .
i ... i just wish this were all so much easier .
well , if it were easier , everybody would be doing it .
alicia florrick .
mrs. florrick , andrew wiley .
about my investigation-- do you have a moment ?
no , mr. wiley , i do not .
and if you contact me one more time without some real evidence ,
i will sue your office for harassment ,
do you understand me ?
this means nothing .
it means everything .
it means luis rios never had a human rights problem on his rigs ,
but you did , mr. francis .
i think that &apos;s a stretch .
let &apos;s see how stretchy it is
to the press and your shareholders .
first i beat george w. bush--
now i beat you , mr. danger !
$ 50 million .
with a gag order .
but we have to close right now .
no .
uh , i think we need a minute .
no we don &apos;t .
you &apos;ll have to do better .
this is not the time to play good cop , bad cop .
i &apos;m not .
$ 50 million is not acceptable .
oh , come on , president !
this is ridiculous .
he &apos;s saying , &quot; i know what you want ,
and you &apos;re never gonna get it . &quot;
wait , who ?
the ceo is telling chavez that he &apos;s never gonna get it .
and the president is saying ,
&quot; it was mine anyway . you stole it . &quot;
what ? what did they steal ?
a geophysical surveying map of the untapped oil reserves
in the orinoco belt .
president chavez wants this map to know where to drill for oil .
and platacostillman commissioned the survey
and considers it proprietary work product .
and what does this have to do with your lawsuit ?
nothing , your honor , in our opinion .
that &apos;s why we ask you to sever the two cases .
president chavez has a conflict of interest here .
what he &apos;s asking for won &apos;t benefit my client in the least .
there is no conflict of interest , your honor .
the president is trying to negotiate
a greater settlement , that &apos;s all .
we all benefit from a greater settlement .
don &apos;t we , your honor ?
y @-@ your honor ?
was that in your opinion ?
well , yes , in my opinion .
so we &apos;re back to square one ?
okay , here &apos;s the deal .
you want the surveys , we want the money .
we &apos;ll drop out of the case , and you settle with
platacostillman for the survey maps .
okay .
and what do you get ?
transfer of $ 86 million to this latin star account
by end of business day today .
you were willing to take $ 50 million from platacostillman .
just consider that the standard surcharge for dictators .
let me take it to the president .
you know , he &apos;s really a nice person ,
once you get to know him .
sings like an angel .
good job , natalie .
you can manage my money anytime .
and thank you .
for everything , really .
this has been cool .
dad , really , you can stop worrying .
i &apos;m not just saying that .
i &apos;m not saying that to make you feel better .
i think he &apos;s a good man .
i think he would be the first to admit he has flaws ,
but i wouldn &apos;t be here if i thought otherwise .
so you think there &apos;s no connection then between the--
a person &apos;s public persona and their private one ?
no , i definitely think there is .
i just think it &apos;s easy for people to judge ,
and i think it &apos;s harder for them to forgive .
so you have forgiven him ?
i have .
what is in the past is in the past .
and your children--
have they forgiven him ?
my children love their father .
they would do anything for him .
and i think the hardest thing for peter
has been seeing how much he &apos;s hurt them .
believe me , he will do anything not to hurt them again .
and what about you , alicia ?
do you have any designs on a political career ?
is it really such a strange question ?
you &apos;re smart , you &apos;re eloquent ,
well @-@ known , well @-@ liked--
my guess is , better liked than your husband .
i doubt that .
i &apos;m not built for it .
i don &apos;t like getting up in front of people .
you could &apos;ve fooled me .
well , thank you .
but i &apos;m enjoying my job too much , and being a mother .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m good at .
and don &apos;t you think we need more women in politics ?
wouldn &apos;t women make a bigger difference in politics ?
i think men and women would ...
what do you think ?
... make just about the same difference in politics .
people do good and bad things based on who they are ...
i think she &apos;s fantastic .
i think she just won him the election .
probably .
you should tell her how fantastic she is .
she knows .
you should tell her .
people like to be told .
you &apos;re in a weird mood .
i am .
after an election year filled with scandals ,
the race for cook county state &apos;s attorney is one we plan to follow ,
as precincts continue to report results .
while peter florrick has kept a slight but consistent lead ...
hey , it &apos;s the candidate &apos;s wife , everybody !
mom , they love you .
it &apos;s election night .
wait till tomorrow .
nice one .
oh . thank you .
alicia florrick had been out of the public eye
for much of this campaign--
so local pundits believed this actually hurt peter ,
not to have his wife--
i &apos;m sorry to interrupt , kate ,
but we have one more township reporting in .
orland township goes to peter florrick .
you need to get him to start thinking about the next .
let him win this one first .
come on , eli .
you rest tonight , we start tomorrow .
on ?
the u.s. senate .
don &apos;t act surprised .
it was the goal all along .
and the democratic committee will stand behind him ?
that &apos;s a good boy you got there , eli .
people like him .
they like his story .
they especially like his wife .
the comeback is one thing ,
but one year after being convicted ,
to get this-- whew !
and that &apos;s a testament to you , by the way .
so you &apos;ll support him officially ?
let him get his feet wet first .
you start lining up donors , and sure , we &apos;ll be there .
alicia !
there you are .
what an interview .
i &apos;ve never seen erica
eat out of someone &apos;s hand like that before .
mr. landau . where &apos;s peter ?
oh , like the bride before the wedding , indisposed .
good job , alicia .
thank you .
grandma &apos;s drunk .
i think that &apos;s just her .
alicia , isn &apos;t it wonderful ?
the kids .
you &apos;re so special .
grace , look at you .
growing up .
you made me proud .
your interview made me cry .
now , i want you to have fun tonight .
i &apos;ll take care of the kids .
we &apos;ve got rooms down the hall .
... closely throughout the evening ,
as precincts continue to report results .
while peter florrick has kept a slight but consistent lead ...
as we continue to await results , we look back ...
you came .
just for a minute .
would you like a drink ?
andre told me he talked to you .
i &apos;m sorry .
he can be pretty insensitive .
come on in .
the opposing lawyer in the case yesterday , mr. thomas--
he hired me to be a full @-@ time translator .
that &apos;s great .
yeah .
it means being in d.c ..
oh , wow . that @-@ that really is great .
yeah .
now when you &apos;re in trouble , you can come to me for help .
if this were another time ...
yeah .
that the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s office
is merely just a stepping stone for his higher office ...
wait a minute , wait a minute .
i want to confirm this before we can report it .
okay . wbbm can now project
that peter florrick is the next state &apos;s attorney ...
i couldn &apos;t get ahold of you .
i &apos;ve been trying your cell .
yes .
i &apos;ve been ignoring your calls .
it &apos;s not bad news .
i &apos;m a bit busy here , mr. wiley .
yeah , it looks like .
i @-@ i was feeling bad .
i found out blake &apos;s interviews were bogus--
just something he made up .
and you came here to tell me that ?
yeah .
why not ?
okay .
thanks .
it was a rumor your husband slept with ,
one of his coworkers two years ago .
the rumor didn &apos;t pan out .
why are you telling me this ?
i wanted you to know .
i mean , it &apos;s always best to know the truth ,
no matter how much it hurts or helps .
do you believe that ?
yes .
i checked out the woman &apos;s name--
the coworker he supposedly slept with .
there was no one in the department with that name .
leela .
but she doesn &apos;t exist .
unless you &apos;ve heard of her .
have you heard of her ? leela ?
you all right ?
let me introduce you to cook county &apos;s
