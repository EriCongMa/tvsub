Hey, Buzzby, how are you today?
Not so great, Bumbleton.
I have a ton of pollen to collect,
but I'm really tired.
Flying a little low? Maybe you should get high.
Who's this?
This is drugs.
Aren't drugs bad?
No way.
Drugs are like special honey. They give you a buzzzzz.
Don't call me honey, honey.
Pierce!
Drugs doesn't say that.
I don't say anything, by the way.
I mean, I thought this show was about drug awareness.
Who's gonna be aware of a character that has no lines?
And also I noticed on page 15 I get flushed down the toilet.
Consider yourself lucky.
Annie, question. Is Pierce marijuana?
And does marijuana help people work faster?
I thought it made them just custom-paint their vans
and solve mysteries.
Also, are you sure that my costume is on backwards?
Somehow I felt more confident before.
I have a question. I don't think my character
would say "Tripping balls."
That's not a question.
I don't think my character would say tripping balls, okay?
Guys, let's remember why we're doing this.
If our work helps even one kid make better choices,
then it will all be worth it.
I wish I had seen a show like this when I was younger.
It might have helped me avoid my mistakes.
Well, we're happy to do this for you, Annie,
But I have to say, my school had plenty of shows like this,
and I think sitting through them drove me to drugs.
You don't count, Britta.
You don't respond to anything appropriately.
Thank you!
Dean-dong!
I'm just checking in to see
how the Greendale antidrug players are doing.
Now, I talked to the guidance counselor at the San Ramone middle school,
And there's gonna be at least 50
little at-risk rug rats coming here tomorrow for your big world premiere.
That is terrific.
So with any luck, we can get rid of all those Charleston Chews
in the vending machines.
Um, Dean Pelton, were you hoping to participate
in the show?
oh, I would love to, Annie.
But as you can see from my outfit,
I already have plans, so off to the Airport Ramada!
How come he gets a front stinger?
第二季 第十三集
Do you think bees eat their own honey?
I'm sure they've at least tasted it.
This guy keeps texting me.
You don't like him?
I don't like flirting in text.
That's like saying you don't work by electric light.
If you want to have an active sex life,
part of it is texting.
Hmm. I don't remember asking your opinion.
Can't talk now.
Shirley, since I might be the father of your unborn child,
I made you a mix tape.
I hope you like Johnny Gill.
And since you probably don't have a cassette player,
here's a list of used ones on Craigslist.
Britta, are you walking out of this room?
Uh--yeah.
Hey... you know that you're gonna
have to acknowledge him eventually.
I don't know who you're talking about.
Chang.
I know who you're talking about--he doesn't exist!
Um, Annie?
I'm sorry. A word?
Mm-hmm!
I don't know if you know this,
but I did tv commercials for Hawthorne Wipes--
family business-- in the fifties.
I was kind of the gerber baby of moist towelettes.
That's great, Pierce.
Yeah, yeah.
Oh, I've done a lot of acting. Workshops.
I do physical comedy. Funny dances.
Foreign accents.
Accents?
Name any country.
Russia.
Point being, there are many tools I can bring to the table
that I think the script may be wasting.
Pierce, you know what I think
is really great about this show?
The only real star of it is the message.
Right. Uh... is the message Jeff Winger?
Because he's on every page of this thing.
I'll see you tomorrow.
You bet.
Oh, Britta left her phone.
She's getting a text message.
Let me see.
Oh. It's from Marcus.
"I'll be at the show tomorrow night.
"Can't wait to see you.
Are you really wearing a cat costume?"
Well, Marcus...
You are in luck.
What are you doing?
Dragging Britta kicking and screaming into 1997.
What did you say?
"There's not much to the cat costume,
but can't wait to show you what's underneath."
How could you think that was a good idea?
I got a better question.
How could it not be a great idea?
What--
Pierce... what are you doing here?
Never mind that.
There's a rapist in the hallway.
That's my landlord.
And if he wanted to rape you, you'd be raped.
Did you follow me?
Let me answer your question with two of my own.
What are you doing in an apartment above Dildopolis?
And when did they open a second location?
This is where I live, Pierce.
It just happens to be above a marital aid store.
I don't get it. Aren't everyone's parents rich?
Well, I'm not speaking to my parents.
After my nervous breakdown,
my mom wanted to put the problem behind us,
and I wanted to deal with it, so I went to rehab,
and she cut me off.
What are you living on?
I saved. Every penny from babysitting,
Every birthday check,
Every dollar from the period fairy when I was a kid.
I guess I thought it would last longer.
Excuse me. What's a period fairy?
The fairy that gives you a dollar
every time you get your period.
Does she still come?
Pierce!
You know,
you and I are very much alike, Annie.
We're both realists. We're both cute.
And we'd both rather die than let someone else control us.
I see the point of this place now.
This crap hole is a monument to self-reliance.
I found the drapes in a dumpster.
Can you believe it?
Yes.
You know, I wanna help, Annie.
Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no, Pierce.
Come on, now.
I'm not taking money from you.
It's not mine. It's yours.
You've earned it for being strong.
It's going to drop into your hands from out of nowhere.
Because I was never here.
Okay. I'm only taking this
because I'm a little worried about making rent,
and they told me the procedure for selling eggs
takes three weeks.
You save your eggs for a rainy day.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Pierce?
Hey, why did you follow me here today?
Oh! It was nothing, it...
seems sort of pointless now.
I guess just to talk about the play
and...who cares if I don't have any lines?
Well, you know what, Pierce?
You should do that line you improvised.
"Don't call me honey, honey"?
Yeah, that's it.
You should do that.
You were the gerber baby of moist towelettes, right?
Yes. Yes, I was.
Action!
Hello. I'm Cornelius Hawthorne.
One rainy day, my son Pierce and I
were taking a stroll when I discovered
the cleansing power of moist cotton, fresh from the field.
Isn't that right, son?
It sure is.
It sure is, dad!
Pierce, knock it off.
I wanna be in the commercial too, father.
Well, then you should have done better in your damn audition.
What's your name, son?
Nigel.
You're a good boy, Nigel.
Your father is a lucky man.
Okay, guys, remember,
the most important thing is to have fun!
And the second most important thing
is to know all your lines and all your blocking
and not mess up a single thing.
Actually--flip those.
Here we go, guys. I took the liberty
of juicing up some of our bits.
Um...but--
Pierce, you can't just revise Annie's script.
And who uses wite-out anymore?
Why don't we look over Pierce's changes
and see if they improve things?
"Hey, Crayon, do you know
where I can get some drugs?
I need them."
"Unfortunately, you can get them anywhere."
"Anywhere?"
I'm here!
Zabba-da-zooey!
Good one.
Well, doesn't seem to hurt anything,
So let's get into costume and break a stinger!
For the bees.
Annie, uh...
I-I don't feel comfortable with the zabba-da-zooey line.
The one you wrote?
I got it!
Let's give Jeff the zabba-da-zooey line,
and then I'll come in with a good one.
Yeah...
It's more my voice.
Pretty sure Jeff is gonna reject that idea.
Yeah, you're probably right.
You're the producer.
By the way, is this your pen?
I...think I put it back in my pocket
after I wrote you that check yesterday.
I'll give it to you later.
I'll talk to Jeff.
Also, I think it'd be better for my character
if I wear his leather jacket.
Okay!
Welcome to Greendale's Drug Awareness Show!
Okay. Our volunteers are handing out
drug-free baseballs, huh?
Next time you think about drugs,
think about baseball instead.
Can't ignore me forever.
Okay, you probably can...
I don't know why you want to.
I don't know if I told you my nephew Marcus
actually goes to San Ramone Middle School,
and he's coming to see the show.
Marcus? Your nephew?
Yeah, he's 14.
I actually thought he didn't even like me,
but then he texted me out of nowhere and he said,
"Can't wait to see you.
"I've been looking forward to this for so long.
You are the coolest Aunt in the world."
I hope that I don't let him down.
You'll be great.
What does this symbol mean?
It's a number eight, an equal sign,
and then a greater than symbol.
Let me see.
You'd better get changed.
I'll hang onto your stuff for you.
Great.
Abed, we screwed up.
You know that text we sent?
It was to Britta's nephew.
He sent her an emoti-penis.
What are we gonna do?
Fine. Screw you, Abed.
I can fix this.
"Marcus, I made a mistake.
I texted the wrong person last night."
"You called me by name. It wasn't a mistake.
Don't be afraid."
Screw you, Abed.
"I was drunk. We can't do this."
"I'm drunk too. On lust."
There's a picture.
Oh! That's disappointing.
Wow, who does that? That's...
Bees, you're up. Cool cats, your on deck.
Aren't drugs bad?
No way.
Drugs are like special honey.
They give you a buzzzzzzz.
Don't call me "Honey," honey.
Are you ignoring me because I'm Korean?
You're Chinese.
Oh, there's a difference?
Shh!
It's because you're crazy, all right?
There's something wrong with you.
And the idea that I was with you
means there's something wrong with me,
and if this baby--
If you have any humanity at all,
You will not make me think about it.
Shirley, funeral.
Well, that answers my question.
Jeff winger is sexy even in a coffin.
I'm here.
Pierce, you're supposed to be onstage.
I was looking for a lighter.
What are you wearing? This is a funeral.
I got this, Annie.
I can't believe fluffy's dead.
I know I'm green, but I feel blue.
Look, it's drugs with a crazy wig and sparklers.
Pokemon
I don't think that's right, drugs.
Nobody asked you, Crayon.
Well, I hope you're proud of yourself, drugs.
Look what you've done.
Oh, yeah? Well, look what I'm doing now.
Smells like something died in here.
What do you want us to do?
Should we get the dean?
Should we call in a bomb threat?
Should we set off the sprinklers?
It's not that big a deal.
I think the kids are into it.
Yeah, but I don't think that they're getting the message.
Yeah, but do kids ever really seem
like they're getting the message?
I think it's sinking in.
Well, I guess it's your call.
And anyway, he's about to get flushed down the toilet
in the next scene, and he'll be done.
I wish I had never even met drugs.
Who invited the nerd from the beehive?
Drugs made you.
How about you leave, drugs?
They want more.
I gotta go back out there.
But Pierce, you were flushed.
That was the story.
That's what's supposed to happen to drugs.
Being flushed doesn't necessarily mean you're dead.
I mean, I could be a floater.
You know, a floater is when you have a number two--
I know what a floater is, Pierce.
It just--it wouldn't make any sense in the flow of the show,
and it sends a mixed message.
You know what I think is a mixed message?
Yesterday you couldn't pay your rent, and today you can.
Come on, Annie. You and I are alike.
We're independent. We need each other.
Bzzz! Getting rid of drugs is a great I-bee-a.
I'm flying higher than I ever have,
Thanks to not drugs.
I'm back!
Ain't no party without drugs!
I love you, drugs!
We want drugs! We want drugs!
Listen to that! They're high on me!
I'm a god!
Where is that Nigel now?
And I haven't even used my penis material yet.
Pierce, enough!
After intermission, I'm going back to the original script
And doing some damage control.
Damage?
The only damage is me
blowing the roof off the universe.
I am not letting you go back on that stage!
Well, maybe I won't be visiting you
late at night anymore with a generous spirit.
You sick, sick, sad old man.
This is why I didn't want to take money from my parents.
I don't want anybody pulling my strings.
Wait, wait. Is he giving you money?
Not anymore.
That's why the script got changed.
Pierce bought his way in. Annie sold out her message.
You've been indulging this maniac?
Yes. I've been indulging this maniac.
You're fired.
Fired?
Next time I'm at Dildopolis,
I will not be coming upstairs to say hi.
We want drugs! we want drugs!
The only reason we did this was for you
and your stupid ideals,
and it turns out you don't even have any.
We supported you, Annie.
Yeah, Annie, you're fired.
I'm sorry!
Here's the situation.
We've got 50 at-risk preteens,
armed with baseballs, chanting for drugs,
Who just spent intermission
eating nothing but Charleston chews, thank god.
Hope you can top act one, is all I'm saying.
Oh! Whoops.
We want drugs!
Should we bail?
Works for me.
Wait!
We want drugs!
Listen to those kids.
We just created 50 potential meth heads,
and the least we can do is hit the reset button
and get that number down to the national average.
That's a suicide mission.
Did someone say crazy person?
No.
Well, I heard it.
We want drugs! We want drugs!
Greetings, you little snots!
You're not drugs.
Oh, but I am!
Disappointed?
Did you expect me to stay the same forever?
'Cause that's not what drug does, baby.
I'm gonna deep-fry your dog and eat your mama's face
and I'm gonna wear your little brother's skin like pajamas.
I control your lives
and there is nothing you can do!
Let's kill him!
Oh, bring it on, bow-wow.
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh, my!
Aah! Aah!
Is that all you've got?
I gotta tell you, Annie,
This is the greatest chemical dependency program
I have ever watched.
I mean, the way you got the kids
to think that they needed drugs,
and then having them realize
That dependence was the enemy,
that the price was just too high.
Oh, genius.
So now that the show is over,
What is the plan for these bee costumes?
Aah! Aah! Uncle!
Hi, Marcus. I'm Jeff.
I'm like, uh, Britta's boyfriend.
Look, dude, she started it, okay?
She's just as into me.
No, listen, listen.
I'm not mad.
I was just fooling around,
and I sent those texts.
gross.
Yeah.
Well, it was pretty disgusting,
sending those pictures to your aunt.
More disgusting than what you texted
to an underage boy?
Yeah, well, I didn't know you were you.
And I didn't know you weren't my aunt.
Okay, all right,
Let's just call this a draw.
Britta doesn't need to ever know about this.
Okay, I'd be happy to, for a price.
That was brave of you.
I owe you an apology.
It was rude to call you crazy.
Maybe I haven't been giving you enough credit.
Oh, that's really sweet. Tell you what.
Why don't I go get Chang? You can tell him that yourself.
Oh, no.
My god, that was amazing!
Wow!
Good job!
Thanks!
Amazing!
Way to go, man, go! That was awesome.
They beat the crap out of you.
It's okay. I did a lot of ad-libbing.
Guys, I'm so sorry.
Thank you so much. That was amazing.
Even I learned something.
Oh, Annie.
We did it.
Group hug, group hug.
Hug, hug.
Way to save the day.
Nice work.
Did you get hit in the face with a baseball?
Yep.
Annie, before you say anything,
I just want you to know,
Even though I did nothing wrong,
I'm still gonna give you money.
No. I can't take your money, Pierce.
I can't go from depending on my parents
to depending on you,
which is why I'm gonna get a job.
So you're cutting me off?
No.
Pierce, I know you don't depend on anyone,
but you do depend on people depending on you,
so I'm not gonna take your money.
We're still friends?
Give me a day.
By the way,
Your mom was the period fairy, right?
Hey, guys, I found my phone,
but has anyone seen my bra?
It's 2:00 a.m.
Time for dildopolis's night-owl deals.
Please be advised,
We will be closed for president's day.
