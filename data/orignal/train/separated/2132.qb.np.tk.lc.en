yeah .
it &apos;s the best , man .
actually , my dad said you just moved here a couple months ago .
is that right ?
yeah , yeah .
what brought you to oahu ?
i don &apos;t know . what didn &apos;t bring me to oahu ?
i mean , we got beautiful beaches ,
you got sunshine all the time .
got ono eats .
place is fantastic .
it &apos;s like heaven compared to new jersey , you know ?
can you please help me find someone ?
no one will tell me anything .
his name is josh .
the police said that he was in a bicycle accident .
if you could just tell me what room he &apos;s in .
are you family ?
he &apos;s my fiane .
if you &apos;re like me ,
you spend a lot of time in the sand and surf ,
and that can dry out your lips .
so whether it &apos;s the north shore or city breaks ,
i never hit the waves without my surf kiss lip gloss .
it gives my lips that surf @-@ kissed ,
want @-@ to @-@ be @-@ kissed look .
take it from four @-@ time world champion , kono kalakaua .
don &apos;t forget your surf kiss .
i was enjoying that .
i &apos;m glad that you were enjoying it ,
&apos;cause that &apos;s probably the closest you will ever be
to a pretty woman for the rest of your life .
you underestimate my resources , detective .
you &apos;d be surprised what a man can do
with the right friends in the right places .
well , that &apos;s ... that &apos;s why we &apos;re here ,
to talk about one of those friends .
specifically the man who ordered you to kill my father .
maybe i came up with that on my own .
maybe i wanted to bury your father
just because i could .
right . yeah , you see , i know you loved your brother ,
but i also know that you didn &apos;t come up with that all by yourself .
you got entry into this country .
you got our comm links ,
you got my extraction route .
now , that came with a price ,
and that was my father &apos;s murder . right ?
gentlemen , i &apos;m afraid i won &apos;t answer any questions
until i &apos;ve retained counsel .
you won &apos;t answer the questions .
look . i @-@ i personally love it
when a guy with a foreign accent tells me to beat it .
it just sounds so much nicer , you know ?
let &apos;s go , let &apos;s go .
no , no , no . whoa . whoa , whoa .
what does this do ?
you can &apos;t do that .
you can &apos;t do that .
he &apos;s right . you can &apos;t do that .
no , no ,
no , you see , i can do that , huh ? right ?
because bono here is not a u.s. citizen .
that means he is not subject
to our constitutional protections .
listen , you &apos;re ... you &apos;re incorrect . okay ?
he @-@ he &apos;s been arrested on u.s. soil .
he &apos;s allowed those rights . you @-@ you know that , right ?
he doesn &apos;t know that . lock the door .
lock the door ?
never mind .
what ?
what the hell is going on in here ?
hey , don &apos;t be rude .
we &apos;re obviously having a conversation here . leave .
hold this pillow , would you ?
do me a favor . also , while you &apos;re out there ,
call the coroner and tell him to get a table ready .
okay ,
no , stop , stop .
what ? what kind of cop are you ?
the kind of cop that gets things done .
excuse me .
hey , look at me . right here . look at me , right here .
right here ...
that &apos;s enough . enough , enough .
enough ?
enough , yeah .
no . no . it &apos;s not enough , okay ?
you told me this man is a terrorist .
9 / 11 , i was there .
i was in new york city , okay ?
so this guy gets no mercy from me , okay ?
i &apos;m sorry , i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m sorry . i didn &apos;t ask you the question .
my bad .
hey .
what ?
don &apos;t unlock the door .
do not unlock that door .
hey ! open up !
what &apos;s going on in there ?
if you don &apos;t like what i &apos;m doing ,
you can wait in the toilet , okay ?
open up !
this man , he tried to execute your father yesterday .
all right ? and i don &apos;t think he &apos;s going to talk
without a little friendly persuasion .
open up !
hey ! give us a minute , please !
do whatever you gotta do .
thank you .
wait . wait .
what ?
i &apos;ll tell you what you want to know .

you &apos;re going to wish i hadn &apos;t .
yeah ?
i &apos;ll take that chance .
who told you about my op ?
good .
you &apos;re up .
let &apos;s begin .
you &apos;re never gonna break me .
behavioral engineering works , steve .
you know that .
it just takes time .
now , tell me ...
where &apos;s my father ?
i don &apos;t know .
you expect me to believe that ?
no .
but it &apos;s the truth .
well , where &apos;s my office gonna be ?
say something stupid again and i &apos;ll shoot you .
ooh , spicy ...
sorry .
oh , we meet again so soon , huh ?
why &apos;s he up there ?
we believe that wo fat
abducted mcgarrett this morning .
oh , and you think i know where he is ?
no , you &apos;re too low on the food chain
to be on his radar .
kick a man when he &apos;s down , huh ?
all right , cut it out .
think . think hard .
associates .
anyone with the resources who would be able to
help wo fat pull this off .
what &apos;s going on ?
do you know anthony shu ?
no .
are you sure ?
he &apos;s supposedly an investor in one of your father &apos;s companies .
kono , i don &apos;t know the name of every one of our investors .
what does this have to do with anything ?
we think wo fat abducted mcgarrett this morning .
sang min says he uses the alias anthony shu
to do business in the united states .
okay , um ...
i &apos;ll go to the office , get everything i can .
okay . thanks .
this can end
if you just tell me what i want to know .
if you &apos;re gonna kill me ,
just do it .
steve , if i wanted to kill you ,
i would have done it long ago .
think about it .
okay .
you want to know where your father is , yeah ?
ask doris .
i know about her trips to colorado to come see you .
you should have asked her when you had the chance .
i asked our mother .
she said she didn &apos;t know .
what did you say ?
you just said &quot; our mother . &quot;
what do you mean by &quot; our mother &quot; ?
she &apos;s not your mother .
i ran the dna , okay ?
i ran the dna .
she &apos;s not your mother , all right ?
what are you giving me ?
what ...
what are you giving me ?
something to help you tell the truth .
authorities have identified the victim as doris mcgarrett ,
a local schoolteacher
and also the wife to honolulu police sergeant john mcgarrett .
now mrs. mcgarrett leaves behind two young children .
hpd officials say they will be investigating this tragic incident ,
which has left one aina haina family in mourning .
no , no , no , no , no .
no .
yeah , copy that . thank you .
okay , so my sources never heard of a wo fat .
okay , all right , i mean , i just ...
you know , who would make up a name like wo fat ?
well , i mean , you @-@ you put two holes in the man--
he would &apos;ve said anything to get you to stop , right ?
look , um , i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m pretty sure that your navy buddies ,
uh , they &apos;re up to speed on everything ,
but if it happens here on this island ,
there &apos;s one man to talk to .
this better be good .
you &apos;re interrupting my lunch .
i &apos;m sure all the other inmates are happy about that .
what are you intimating ?
by missing a meal , everyone in this place will eat ?
and if i don &apos;t , they starve ?
sure ... uh , lighten up , would you ?
why don &apos;t you shut up ?
and who are you ?
strippergram ?
lieutenant commander steve mcgarrett .
and what do you want , commander ?
well , detective williams here told me
you might know where we can find a man named wo fat .
try hell .

fresh shrimp . twice a week .
i &apos;m tired of the spam .

now tell us where to find him .
my father .
where is he ?
i already told you . i don &apos;t know .
very well .
no , no , no , no .
i can &apos;t tell you what ...
what i don &apos;t know ...
what i don &apos;t know .
why try to kill my father ?
what did he ever do to you ? !
what &apos;d he ever do to you ?
commander ?
look , i know you know that this is hawaii ,
but , uh , we usually don &apos;t wear uniforms
unless we &apos;re going to a ceremony .
see ?
i &apos;m , uh , heading out .
well , that &apos;s , uh , that &apos;s too bad , you know ?
&apos;cause i was thinking about what we did .
i thought maybe , uh , you &apos;d be interested
in a career in law enforcement .
what do you say ? &quot; a career in law enforcement &quot; ?
that &apos;s right , yeah .
um , i don &apos;t know . maybe , maybe someday .
all right , well , you think about it .
you ever get homesick , uh , i &apos;ll put in
a word with captain kelly and maybe , uh ,
put you to work . what do you think ?
tell you what . i could , uh ,
i could get used to be being chauffeured
around all day , that &apos;s for sure .
that &apos;s right .
see you around , danny .
hey ! danno .
call me danno . all my friends do , all right ?
all right , danno .
safe flight , buddy . okay ?
all right .
all right , take care .
navy &apos;s taught you well .
you son of ...
i &apos;m gonna kill you .
and then i &apos;m gonna find your father .
i &apos;m gonna kill him just for having you .
then you &apos;re going to have to kill your mother , too .
what are you talking about ? !
your mother is more responsible
for who i am today .
stop talking in circles !
you know nothing about the real doris mcgarrett .
do you ?
i know ...
... that she was assigned to kill your father .
but instead your mother died in that op .
yes .
and she never forgave herself for murdering
an innocent woman
who had just become a new mother .
that pain and anguish
caused her to do something quite ... remarkable .
she took in that child and raised it as her own
for several years .
until her superiors discovered this ...
and forced her ...
they forced her to abandon
that child .
that was you .
you see ?
doris mcgarrett ...
was my mother , too .
if doris knew where my father was ,
she would &apos;ve told me .
but with your persistence ,
i can &apos;t help but believe
you know where your government is holding him .
i don &apos;t .
that may be true .
but i need to be convinced .
i &apos;m telling you the truth .
i don &apos;t know where your father is .
hey , guys .
i think i may know where wo fat is .
where ?
