excuse me . sorry .
you telegraph your marks .
four years in prison , and you &apos;re still the best .
show @-@ off .
miss me , alex ?
never thought about it .
you have something that belongs to me .
actually , it , uh ...
belongs to a guy named joe nelson .
come on . you still running that trick ?
small amusements to keep the day interesting .
now , what do you want , caffrey ?
i need your expertise .
on this .
the music box .
you &apos;re finally admitting you never had it ?
you got closer than anyone else .
we got closer ,
but that didn &apos;t work out .
maybe it will this time .
sorry . i can &apos;t help you .
i gave up on that a long time ago .
oh , yeah ? then why do you still carry this in your purse ?
it &apos;s a piece from the box , right ?
know your mark .
remember ?
don &apos;t fault me for nostalgia .
i couldn &apos;t bring myself to part with it .
i don &apos;t know anything more about the music box .
my number &apos;s in here ... in case .
good to see you , alex .
shift change , boys and girls . what &apos;s happening ?
nothing unusual .
a couple of housekeepers and staff coming in and out .
our insider trader do any insider trading ?
oh , he &apos;s been a little too preoccupied to make any calls .
rewind the tape , jones .
that doesn &apos;t look like mrs. gray .
bought himself a nooner with a younger version .
hey , how do you know he &apos;s paying for it ?
maybe it &apos;s true love .
seriously ? a guy that old with a girl that young ?
he &apos;s buying her with something .
when was this ?
oh , 40 minutes ago .
was that on tape ?
that was a gunshot .
shots fired . lauren , call up the ops center .
request immediate backup .
move in , move in !
this is lauren cruz with squad c @-@ 12,
cred number 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 0 .
fbi !
clear !
clear !
i &apos;ve got a body . it &apos;s gray .
let me see your hands .
he r-- he ran out that door ...
right over there .
got footprints going out the door .
keep your hands where i can see them .
backup on the way ?
yeah . nypd should be here in a second .
jones , check the upstairs .
tell nypd we &apos;re pursuing a male suspect ,
armed and dangerous .
here .
all right . have a seat .
it &apos;s clear upstairs .
tell me your name .
pierce .
pierce , can you tell me what happened ?
he was hiding in the room when we came inside .
then the gun fired .
it happened s @-@ so quickly .
then the man went out the door ?
all right , all right .
i want you to escort her to the hospital with nypd
for review .
try to get a description of this guy .
okay , people . let &apos;s round up the staff .
i want to talk to every single person
who &apos;s been in this house today .
jones ...
... find me caffrey .
go ahead .
that &apos;s a dead body .
yep .
this doesn &apos;t really fall into my area of expertise , peter .
murder isn &apos;t an intellectual pursuit ,
and i &apos;m not really a dead @-@ guy kind of guy ,
so ... i &apos;m gonna go .
you have a lot of rules for a guy who doesn &apos;t play by them .
yeah .
aldys christopher gray .
heard of him ?
yeah . stock trader .
made a killing in derivatives
right before the crash .
he has quite the art collection .
maybe this is my area of expertise .
we &apos;ve been sitting on him for three weeks .
today , he comes home with a woman ,
possibly an escort .
somebody takes a shot at him .
by the time we get here ,
he &apos;s dead , the killer &apos;s gone .
so , what am i doing here ?
something &apos;s off .
what &apos;s wrong with this picture ?
where &apos;s the witness ?
she &apos;s in shock -- had bruises all over her .
lauren traveled with her to the hospital with nypd .
walk me through it , sherlock .
yeah , all right .
the witness says that the shooter was already inside .
is this the girl &apos;s purse ?
she and gray came in .
there was a struggle . shots were fired .
gray ends up here .
now , i -- are you paying attention ?
yeah , yeah . i can multitask .
all right .
so , the witness was doubled up over here in this corner .
she said that they struggled ,
and then the guy went out the door .
i entered , and then i --
i &apos;m sorry . am i boring you ?
this is a fake .
what ?
the ink hasn &apos;t had time to fully dry .
but this is high @-@ end work , peter .
you can &apos;t just get this on the street .
no , you can &apos;t .
jones .
yeah ?
run indices on pierce spelman .
and call lauren .
i want to see if we can get a real name off of pierce .
her id is a fake .
copy that .
she used his shoe to make an impression in the dirt .
she &apos;s not a witness . she &apos;s the shooter .
agent burke !
no one else was in the room .
nurses at the hospital took pierce in for a private exam ,
left her alone to undress .
she slipped out the back . she &apos;s gone .
you &apos;re late .
you &apos;re never late .
rough morning .
had to take the subway in .
you know how hard it is to rush
when you &apos;re carrying this many bags ?
did elizabeth kick you out ?
no .
then why the bags ?
you ask too many questions .
lauren , you looking up that stuff ?
on it .
jones , we any closer to finding our missing girl ?
we don &apos;t have much to go on --
fake name , no match for the prints found in the room .
all we &apos;ve got is a purse .
we &apos;ll get that from ert . this afternoon .
all right , stay on it .
i want a briefing as soon as it gets here .
here we go .
your options .
hotel rooms ? peter , what did you do ?
we &apos;re upgrading our wiring system ,
getting the whole hd surround sound put in .
el took the dog and the car to her sister &apos;s upstate .
the good news is once this is all in place ,
i can watch the game ... once the power &apos;s back on .
how long will it be out ?
couple days -- hence the hotel .
the thompson hotel .
you said you wanted a big tv .
they have the biggest .
how much is this ?
$ 825 a night ... with our government discount .
next .
peter , it &apos;s ridiculous for you to stay in a hotel
when there &apos;s more than enough room at june &apos;s .
no , thanks . i @-@ i &apos;ll be fine .
this one has a pool . i &apos;ve never had a pool .
$ 425 a night .
let &apos;s go to the bottom of the pile .
ah , here we go . that one ?
59 bucks .
book it .
already did .
isn &apos;t that the place where you put neal
when he was first released ?
they have an interesting no @-@ heat policy .
i don &apos;t need amenities .
just give me a wall , a tv , and a bed , and i &apos;m happy .
are you serious ?
yeah .
peter , mi casa es su casa .
su casa is not even su casa .
jones , what do we have ?
okay , these are the items from the woman &apos;s purse .
name on the i.d. is pierce spelman .
the card &apos;s a fake . no record of her prints .
we found the gun stuffed inside the fireplace --
wiped of prints , serial number filed off .
whoever she is , she &apos;s good .
that looks like a to @-@ do list .
&quot; verify pie , &quot; &quot; spike rn . &quot;
that &apos;s an odd list of activities .
it &apos;s a code .
get this to the cryptanalyst and then back to me .
i &apos;ve got to go check into my hotel .
uh , no , no , no -- motel .
motel with an &quot; m . &quot;
yep . i &apos;m coming .
you &apos;re a bastard .
good evening , alex .
i looked into you , caffrey .
know your mark , right ?
yeah .
you &apos;ve turned fed ?
i was forced fed .
that &apos;s funny , neal .
i know it &apos;s been a while ,
but it &apos;s , uh , still my job
to dig up confidential information .
occupational hazard ?
did you really think i wouldn &apos;t find out ?
it was a small hope .
okay .
okay , every now and again ,
they go after some madoff @-@ type guy
and ask me how he did it .
other than that , i barely communicate with them .
then why the anklet ?
they don &apos;t like me much .
they use the anklet to track me remotely
so they don &apos;t have to deal with me in person .
are you trying to set me up ?
i &apos;m trying to get something we both want .
what did you find , alex ?
motel with an &quot; m . &quot;
no tv .
somebody lose a dog ?
what are you doing ?
why the sudden curiosity about the music box ?
i couldn &apos;t look for it in prison , but i &apos;m out now .
and i was starting to miss you .
nice try .
i tracked down the fence who gave me this .
he says there &apos;s been a sudden interest in the box .
does he know who has it ?
he still won &apos;t tell me how he got this .
we have to find it before someone else does .
what &apos;s going on ?
this isn &apos;t just about the box .
you get a lot of late @-@ night visitors .
yeah , that &apos;s probably just my landlady .
who is it ?
it &apos;s peter .
who &apos;s peter ?
oh , he &apos;s -- he &apos;s just a friend .
but he cannot know you &apos;re here about the music box .
we need a cover .
what are you doing ?
why else would i be here ?
just like old times .
neal ?
coming .
you good ?
good .
what &apos;s up , buddy ? what are you doing here ?
oh , man , i am so sorry for barging in , but i --
oh . i &apos;m really sorry .
no , no , it &apos;s fine . she was just leaving .
no , no , no . i &apos;ll go .
are you a friend of neal &apos;s ?
you can say that , yes .
peter burke .
how do you two know each other ?
i &apos;m an fbi agent .
how &apos;s it going ?
fbi .
interesting .
lovely to see you , as always , neal .
hey , don &apos;t leave on account of me .
oh , no , no , no .
we &apos;re done .
nice girl .
yeah .
she &apos;s an old friend .
you &apos;ve got better @-@ looking friends than i do .
what about , uh , kate ?
well , you told me to forget her .
and you listened to me ?
there &apos;s a first time for everything .
ah . who you playing ?
please don &apos;t touch that . what are you doing here ?
what happened to the hotel ?
motel .
and it was occupied .
oh . dog staying there ?
yeah , what &apos;s with the dog ?
now you understand
why i was forced to seek other accommodations .
mm . lucky for us .
&quot; us &quot; ?
yeah . su casa es mi casa , right ?
right ?
yes .
right . oh , i just got hungry .
where &apos;s the remote ?
this is gonna be really fun .
&quot; when asked , he quoted that he and the cow
had been friends for years . &quot;
no .
the cow ?
yes .
neal never does with me .
no , i know .
morning .
morning .
you sleep okay ?
oh , i could get used to this .
you &apos;re in my chair .
oh , i didn &apos;t see your name on it .
you guys playing scrabble ?
sort of .
trying to figure out what this means .
really ?
i &apos;ve seen a code once or twice in my life .
we were playing with shift ciphers .
yeah .
glad you &apos;re having fun .
we should get him a banana or something .
i think so , yes .
this is the actual list , isn &apos;t it ?
you stole from evidence .
borrowed , okay ? i made a copy for you guys .
doesn &apos;t matter -- i tried keywords , anagrams ,
charlemagne &apos;s cipher , rohan &apos;s -- everything .
&quot; aldis gray . &quot;
you spelled his name wrong .
&quot; aldys &quot; is spelled with a &quot; y . &quot;
what ?
it &apos;s a shift code hidden in an anagram .
all right , there are five items on the list .
shift the alphabet forward by five letters .
&quot; a &quot; becomes &quot; e , &quot; &quot; b &quot; becomes &quot; f . &quot;
reassemble ...
&quot; check pew v &quot; becomes &quot; aldys gray . &quot;
it &apos;s a list of names .
a hit list ?
the dead guy &apos;s fourth down .
let &apos;s find out who &apos;s next .
morning . cryptanalyst called .
shift code hidden in an anagram ?
she called you , too ?
no , but i need you to pull these names a.s.a.p.
nice .
hey , peter . how was the hotel last night ?
fine . loud .
bed &apos;s a bed . you know . don &apos;t say anything .
peter stayed at my place . he couldn &apos;t handle the motel .
i can handle the motel .
i just prefer tormenting you .
mmhumm .
jones , do me a favor .
i want you to run prints on this ,
see if we can find out who they belong to .
keep it quiet ?
yeah .
so , the first two guys on the cracked @-@ code list
are earl bauen , an oil guy from texas ,
and jon elga from l.a. --
both shut up real quick
when i sent over pierce &apos;s picture ,
swore they had never laid eyes on her .
they &apos;re married ?
yep .
third guy is ben thalen .
he &apos;s a real @-@ estate titan from new jersey .
two months ago ,
he claims he was shot during a hunting accident .
with a seecamp .32 acp ?
that &apos;s a good hunting weapon .
i &apos;m guessing he never met pierce , either .
right .
speaking of pierce ,
we found a set of fingerprints that we think are hers .
we highlighted the areas where she touched .
she &apos;s searching for something .
her prints are all over the drawers
and around the paintings -- maybe looking for a safe .
you think she &apos;s robbing them ?
then why didn &apos;t she take his wallet
or any of the valuables in plain sight ?
this list is precise .
she &apos;s looking for something specific .
yeah , she &apos;s smart --
appeals to their greatest weakness to get in the door ,
then takes what she needs .
but why shoot thalen and kill gray ?
pierce had bruises on her back , right ?
she couldn &apos;t have done that to herself .
what ? you think gray walked in mid @-@ theft ?
yeah .
preliminary tox screens on gray
reveal a mild barbiturate in his system .
she probably drugged him
and then went looking for what she &apos;s after .
and he woke up . they struggled . she pulled a gun .
she &apos;s not afraid to kill if she has to .
who &apos;s next on the list ?
last one &apos;s a local .
fifth and last and single .
daniel picah .
he &apos;s a trust @-@ fund baby .
family left him a mess of money .
wonder what he has that &apos;s so appealing ?
whatever it is could get him killed .
is he talking ?
yeah , you could say that .
we should talk to june about getting an elevator .
didn &apos;t think you were staying that long .
hey . fbi guys .
how &apos;s it going ?
i &apos;m agent peter burke . this is neal caffrey .
not &quot; agent neal caffrey &quot; ?
consultant .
oh , what do you consult on ?
frauds , forgeries , cons .
awesome hat trick . can you teach me that ?
you like that statue ? don &apos;t worry . it &apos;s real .
he uses a boaz vaadia
bust as a hat rack .
you know how much this bust is worth ?
i paid $ 450,000 for that .
i can &apos;t be here .
mr. picah .
hey , we &apos;re friends . call me dan .
okay , dan .
have you , uh ...
been in contact with any beautiful women recently ?
sure . it &apos;s new york .
i &apos;m dating all the time .
why ? what &apos;s going on ?
well , have you been in touch with her ?
no , but she &apos;s pretty .
should i be in touch with her ?
we think she might be after something you own ,
something ... rare .
awesome . i got tons of stuff .
what do you think she wants ?
we were hoping you could tell us .
maybe it &apos;s my sword .
it &apos;s a go yoshihiro .
japanese , 13th century .
cost me $ 220,000 , if you can believe that .
but i love history . do you like history ?
silent type . i get it .
you ever pull your weapon ?
you ...
shoot anybody ? shoot ?
i &apos;ve come close a few times .
hey . we got to move this along .
are you not standing in the same space i am ?
peter , it could be anything .
all of this is valuable and
completely incoherent .
you guys want to see the rest of the place ?
no , i really don &apos;t .
we have to .
let &apos;s go , moriarty .
yeah , that &apos;d be great .
awesome .
i got four floors . let &apos;s start at the top .
hey .
hey .
want a beer ?
oh , we don &apos;t have any beer .
oh , i got some . i got us a whole case .
you &apos;re sweating .
yeah .
yeah , this is a nice couch , so ...
yeah . it &apos;s comfy .
look , i &apos;m reading . i &apos;m doing some research .
yeah , so am i --
i &apos;m reading and researching and listening .
i &apos;m multitasking .
what are you -- what are you doing ?
i -- no. no .
when -- when i &apos;m in my home ,
i listen to the game , and i look at my case files .
too bad we &apos;re not in your home .
well , yeah .
the power &apos;s still off , so we &apos;ll have to hear it .
all right , i &apos;m going downstairs .
why ?
i &apos;m going downstairs .
i can &apos;t think . it &apos;s too loud .
it &apos;s like ...
all right .
the music box .
peter !
go back to the house .
i told you -- the power &apos;s out . i can &apos;t go --
no , no , christopher gray &apos;s house .
the fbi interrupted pierce &apos;s search .
she wasn &apos;t expecting that .
so whatever she was looking for is still there .
maybe we can figure out what gray and dan have in common
if we go back .
with dan .
it &apos;s the fbi guys . hey , welcome back .
uh , dan , we need your help with something .
mind coming with us ?
awesome . of course . let me get my hat .
let &apos;s go .
yeah . looks good .
thank you .
so , this is a crime scene ?
yeah .
that was where the body was .
don &apos;t touch anything , right ?
i won &apos;t .
just , uh ... survey the scene .
dan , look in every room .
it could be anything you have .
yeah , i &apos;ll let you know , pete .
hey , neal ,
maybe you can teach me that hat trick sometime ?
yeah . yeah , maybe .
he wants to learn your hat trick .
that &apos;s adorable .
don &apos;t , peter .
well , it &apos;s adorable . it &apos;s adorable .
go keep an eye on him .
so , what happens if i don &apos;t find it ?
where are we going next ?
he &apos;s stalling &apos; cause he wants to hang out with you .
no . he &apos;s stalling &apos; cause he wants to hang out with you .
no , he -- is that fingerprint dust ?
neal , did you see this ?
yeah .
okay . yeah , let &apos;s go check another room .
okay , you &apos;re hanging out with him .
no , you &apos;re hanging out with him .
this is your job , peter . - i &apos;m not -- it &apos;s not --
rock @-@ paper @-@ scissors . - i &apos;m not gonna rock --
rock @-@ paper @-@ scissors .
this is it .
did i do good ?
you did great .
peter , you know what this is ?
it &apos;s one of the emperor &apos;s five elephants .
there &apos;s five ?
in 1421 , ambassadors from all over the world
came to china to celebrate the inauguration of the forbidden city .
upon leaving , the chinese emperor , zhu di ,
gifted them each with a treasure .
they were subsequently stolen
and reappeared in the united states in 1901 .
they were broken up and sold individually .
this is imperial jade ,
so each statue on its own is relatively valuable .
how much did you pay for yours , dan ?
$ 800,000 , if you can believe it .
combine one with the other ,
you just doubled your price .
link them all together ,
and they &apos;re worth between $ 150 and $ 200 million
fenced on the black market .
or to us , a priceless piece of our history .
agents -- and neal --
this is daichi yoshida of the japanese embassy .
konnichiwa . youkoso .
ah , arigato gozaimasu .
you are the ambassador of awesome .
don &apos;t encourage him .
we are not interested in the monetary value of the statues .
we &apos;d like to bring them home .
the japanese government has filed a claim
stating the statues were stolen from them
and illegally imported to the u.s.
we &apos;re cooperating in the efforts
to restitute them to their proper ownership .
and we thank you , mr. picah , for turning over your piece .
see ? i did good ?
you did good , dan .
we can finish this discussion in my office .
it &apos;s very important
we recover the missing pieces of the set , peter .
we don &apos;t want an international incident on our hands .
we can &apos;t recover any of these pieces
until we find out where pierce is .
what if we know who her next target is ?
hey , peter , you got a sec ?
yeah . just going through dan &apos;s phone logs ... again .
no contact with pierce .
lauren still going through his computer ?
yeah .
listen , i got that other info you asked for .
her name &apos;s alexandra hunter .
she &apos;s a high @-@ end fence ,
deals mostly in eastern european antiquities .
only been arrested once , in france ,
but all charges were mysteriously dropped .
checked with a former law @-@ school buddy of mine in the d.a. &apos; s office
you know , just to see if he &apos;d ever heard of her .
all he &apos;d say is she has powerful friends .
anything else ?
no , thanks .
all right .
i got something .
i &apos;ve been going through all of dan &apos;s online dating profiles .
come on . this guy did not play college football .
yeah , he &apos;s not a doctor , either .
he changed his profile picture to include the hat .
it just gets more adorable .
well , pierce must have thought so , too .
she &apos;s desperate enough for the jade elephant
she winked at him last night .
left her phone number -- belongs to a prepaid .
so , what --
should we arrange a meet , move in for an arrest ?
no , our evidence is too circumstantial .
hughes is concerned we don &apos;t have enough to hold her ,
and she &apos;ll disappear with the jade for good ,
which will not make the japanese happy .
which will not make hughes happy .
i say we send dan in for one hell of a date .
daniel ?
you look a little different in your profile picture .
pleasantly surprised ?
no .
stay . stay just for one drink .
i promise you -- it &apos;s worth it .
another ketel one on the rocks , please . thanks .
who are you ?
i &apos;m the guy who set you up .
the fbi was sitting on christopher gray &apos;s house
&apos;cause i tipped them off .
and why would you do a stupid thing like that ?
so i could get to these first .
you got daniel picah &apos;s ?
how did you get to it so quickly ?
dan just needed a friend .
i take it you don &apos;t approve of my methods ?
i think there are smarter ways of getting what you want .
well , it &apos;s different for a man .
you should be grateful for that luxury .
i , uh , have to work with what i &apos;ve got .
that &apos;s a slightly jaded perspective .
excuse the pun .
i don &apos;t think so .
i have a lot to work with .
you do have something i want .
and how do you propose we solve that ?
team up .
i got two . you got three .
separate , we &apos;re worth about $ 2 million .
that &apos;s not bad .
but together , we &apos;re worth $ 200 million ,
which , if you &apos;re bad at math , is significantly higher .
i prefer to work alone .
then enjoy your $ 2 million .
so you are good at math .
you underestimate me .
he &apos;s got her . okay , neal , close the deal .
miss me , caffrey ?
who &apos;s that ?
what are you doing here , alex ?
that &apos;s caffrey &apos;s fence . she &apos;s gonna blow the deal .
i don &apos;t see you for five years .
and within minutes of waltzing back into my life ,
i &apos;ve got the fbi checking up on me ?
this is another setup .
no , it &apos;s not .
it stings when someone messes with your job , doesn &apos;t it ?
fbi ran my prints . that &apos;s bad for my business .
it &apos;s not what you think , alex .
jones , you run interference with alex .
lauren , take the back exit . i &apos;ll take the side .
we can &apos;t lose track of pierce !
not much of an escape route .
i &apos;m good on my feet .
i want the jade .
you &apos;re not going anywhere without me .
it &apos;s just like a man to think he knows everything .
help ! please ! he &apos;s attacking me !
help ! he &apos;s attacking me !
get your hands off her !
aren &apos;t you clever ?
i work with what i &apos;ve got .
hey !
i think there &apos;s been a misunderstanding here , guys !
she &apos;s crazy !
whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa ! fbi ! fbi !
let him go . let him go .
he was attacking a woman .
all right , all right .
i &apos;ll take it from here .
thank you so much for that . thank you .
all right .
thanks .
lauren , i &apos;ve got neal .
pierce disappeared into the crowd .
you see where she went ?
no , i was a little preoccupied
with the guys closing in to kill me .
cutting it a little close there , huh ?
yeah , we weren &apos;t expecting your girlfriend to show up .
i know about alex .
she disappeared again .
what the hell happened back there , neal ?
what was your fence doing
walking right through the middle of our operation ?
what were you doing pulling her prints ?
what , i welcome you into my home ,
and -- and you run a file on my friend ?
you can &apos;t trust me ? after everything ?
you tell me .
i know you &apos;re looking for the music box .
maybe you &apos;re looking to pawn the jade , too .
you let pierce walk because you &apos;re playing your own angle ?
there were three of them , peter !
you shouldn &apos;t have let her go !
okay , you know what ? you think what you want to think .
i &apos;ll walk from here .
where are you going ?
home -- something you don &apos;t have right now .
if you don &apos;t trust me , you can check my anklet .
i will !
do it .
you found another gun .
good .
hello , mr. caffrey .
how did you find me ?
your friend let your last name slip at the bar .
i did a little research .
come in. sit .
shut the door behind you .
you always break into places dressed like that ?
where are the pieces ?
i gave them to a friend for safekeeping .
take me to them .
okay .
wait .
we won &apos;t be taking your tracking anklet with us , neal .
as soon as i cut this , an alarm is triggered .
the response time is five minutes .
so let &apos;s be quick .
neal ?
neal ?
okay .
speak a word , and she &apos;s dead .
hi . can i help you ?
oh , i &apos;m sorry to interrupt .
i know you told me
you were just going to wait here for neal to arrive ,
but i heard the door slam .

sorry. long day .
neal &apos;s actually just getting out of the shower ,
but i will tell him you stopped by .
that &apos;s fine .
night .

ticktock .
let &apos;s go .
neal cut his anklet .
oh , that &apos;s her .
all right , pull every alias caffrey has ,
hit the airports and the waterways .
we can &apos;t let him escape with the jade ,
or the japanese are gonna be very , very upset .
i don &apos;t think they ran together .
neal knows better by now .
peter , he set alex up as a fence for the jade ,
and he let pierce escape tonight .
caffrey put every damn thing in place .
peter ...
we both know he didn &apos;t run .
pull neal &apos;s tracking information .
i want to see everywhere he went this week .
okay .
that &apos;s neal at the bar tonight .
just let it play .
all right , that &apos;s us walking to the car .
that &apos;s him deciding to walk instead .
can you fast @-@ forward it ?
that &apos;s him at june &apos;s house .
okay , so caffrey cuts it here .
why don &apos;t we go back to yesterday ?
wait , wait , wait .
what &apos;s that flickering at the end ?
a short circuit when he cut it ?
play it again .
that &apos;s not a short circuit. that &apos;s morse code .
&quot; power . &quot;
i know where he is .
yeah , my buddy &apos;s upstate .
cuts the power when he goes .
it &apos;s the perfect hiding place for the jade .
where are the pieces ?
he told me he put them in a drawer .
hey !
you think i &apos;m stupid ?
stay back where i can see you .
we can &apos;t get eyes inside .
it &apos;s too dangerous to go in blind .
what if i give us a flash @-@ bang ?
on three , we turn on the power and we storm the entrances .
what &apos;s gonna happen when the power comes on ?
i don &apos;t know , but i &apos;m trusting neal .
okay. let &apos;s get the battering rams ready .
are you insane ? that &apos;s my house .
i &apos;ve got keys .
where the hell are they ?
he swore to me that they are here , okay ?
don &apos;t play with me , caffrey .
hey , hey , i want this thing over just as much as you do .
all right ?
ready ?
anyone knocks anything over , they deal directly with my wife .
copy that . ready .
wipe your feet .
ready at the back door .
they &apos;re not in here , caffrey .
if he said they &apos;re here , they &apos;re here .
we just got to keep looking .
on three , the power &apos;s going on. ready ?
here we go. one ...
please .
... two ...
... three .
fbi !
welcome home .
thank you
you have done a great service for our country .
it &apos;s our pleasure .
indeed .
good job , burke .
couldn &apos;t have done it without caffrey .
excuse us .
she negotiated the jade for a 4 @-@ year sentence ?
i got four years , and i never killed anyone .
guess what she had to work with is better than what you had .
why are they looking at me ?
ah , it &apos;s nothing. it &apos;s nothing. hey , check this out .
the saito hotel .
look at that tv .
thanks to our goodwill with the japanese ambassador ,
i &apos;ve arranged for you to stay there .
you kicking me out ?
no. no , no .
i just thought you could watch the game on that tv tonight .
it &apos;s yours for the rest of the week .
i just have to go back to your place and grab my bags .
what kind of friend would i be
if i made you get your own bags ?
all set .
is this because i ran alex &apos;s prints ?
it &apos;s for so many reasons , peter .
thanks .
anytime .
not this time , neal .
those have lost their charm for me .
what are you doing here ?
i thought we could start fresh ,
go back to the beginning .
you and i have too much of a history to start fresh , neal .
i &apos;m sorry .
i should have been honest with you .
i know better than to trust you .
likewise .
but i &apos;m willing to take a leap of faith .
how willing ?
i know where the music box is .
where ?
well , as long as you &apos;re working for the fbi ,
you &apos;ll never know .
come on .
