okay , if no one else will say it , i will .
we really suck at paintball .
that was absolutely humiliating .
oh , come on . some battles you win , some battles you lose .
yes , but you don &apos;t have to lose to kyle bernstein &apos;s bar mitzvah party .
i think we have to acknowledge ,
those were some fairly savage preadolescent jews .
no , we were annihilated by our own incompetence
and the inability of some people to follow the chain of command .
sheldon , let it go !
no , i want to talk about the fact that wolowitz shot me in the back .
i shot you for good reason .
you were leading us into disaster .
i was giving clear , concise orders .
you hid behind a tree yelling , &quot; get the kid in the yarmulke !
get the kid in the yarmulke ! &quot;
oh , hey , guys .
oh , hey , penny . hello .
morning , ma &apos;am .
so , how was paintball ? did you have fun ?
sure , if you consider being fragged by your own troops fun .
you clear space on your calendar--there will be an inquiry .
okay .
um , hey , i &apos;m having a party on saturday ,
so if you guys are around , you should come on by .
a party ?
yeah .
a ... &quot; boy @-@ girl &quot; party ?
well , there will be boys and there will be girls and it is a party , so ...
it &apos;ll just be a bunch of my friends .
we &apos;ll have some beer , do a little dancing .
dancing ?
yeah , i don &apos;t know , penny ...
the thing is , we &apos;re not ...
no , we &apos;re really more of a ...
no .
but thanks.thanks for thinking of us .
are you sure ? come on , it &apos;s halloween .
a halloween party ?
as in ... costumes ?
well , yeah .
is there a theme ?
um , yeah , halloween .
yes , but are the costumes random , or genre @-@ specific ?
as usual , i &apos;m not following .
he &apos;s asking if we can come as anyone from science fiction , fantasy ...
sure .
what about comic books ?
fine .
anime ?
of course .
tv , film ,
d- and @-@ d , manga , greek gods , roman gods , norse gods--
anything you want ! okay ?
any costume you want .
bye .
gentlemen , to the sewing machines .
&lt; font color = # 38b0de &gt; the big bang theory season 1 episode 06 &lt; / font &gt;
i &apos;ll get it .
oh , no .
oh , no .
make way for the fastest man alive !
oh , no .
see , this is why i wanted to have a costume meeting .
we all have other costumes : we can change .
or we could walk right behind each other all night
and look like one person going really fast .
no , no , no .
it &apos;s a boy @-@ girl party , this flash runs solo .
okay , how about this ?
nobody gets to be the flash .
we all change . agreed ?
agreed .
i call frodo !
damn !
hey .
sorry i &apos;m late , but my hammer got stuck in the door on the bus .
you went with thor ?
what , just because i &apos;m indian i can &apos;t be a norse god ?
&quot; no , no , raj has to be an indian god . &quot;
that &apos;s racism .
i mean look at wolowitz.he &apos;s not english ,
but he &apos;s dressed like peter pan .
sheldon is neither sound nor light ,
but he &apos;s obviously the doppler effect .
i &apos;m not peter pan .
i &apos;m robin hood .
really ?
because i sawpeter pan , and you &apos;re dressed exactly like cathy rigby .
she was a little bigger than you , but it &apos;s basically the same look , man .
hey , sheldon
there &apos;s something i want to talk to you about before we go to the party .
i don &apos;t care if anybody gets it .
i &apos;m going as the doppler effect .
no , it &apos;s not that .
if i have to , i can demonstrate .
terrific .
this party is my first chance for penny
to see me in the context of her social group ,
and i need you not to embarrass me tonight .
well , what exactly do you mean by embarrass you ?
well , for example , tonight ,
no one needs to know that my middle name is leakey .
but there &apos;s nothing embarrassing about that .
your father worked with louis leakey , a great anthropologist .
it had nothing to do with your bed @-@ wetting .
all m saying is that this party is the perfect opportunity for penny
to see me as a member of her peer group ,
a potential close friend , and perhaps more ,
and i don &apos;t want to look like a dork .
just a heads up , fellas .
if anyone gets lucky , i &apos;ve got a dozen condoms in my quiver .
oh , hey , guys .
hey . sorry we &apos;re late .
late ?
it &apos;s 7 : 05 .
and you said the party starts at 7 : 00 .
well , yeah , i mean , when you start a party at 7 : 00,
no one shows up at , you know , 7 : 00 .
it &apos;s 7 : 05 .
yes . yes , it is .
okay . well , um , come on in .
so , what , are all the girls in the bathroom ?
probably , but in their own homes .
so , what time does the costume parade start ?
the parade ?
yeah , so the judges can give out the prizes for best costume .
you know , most frightening , most authentic ,
most accurate visualization of a scientific principal .
oh , sheldon , i &apos;m sorry ,
but there aren &apos;t going to be any parades
or judges or prizes .
this party is just going to suck .
no ! come on , it &apos;s going to be fun ,
and you all look great .
i mean , look at you , thor ,
and , oh , peter pan . that &apos;s so cute .
actually , penny , he &apos;s robin hood .
i &apos;m peter pan .
and i got a handful of pixie dust with your name on it .
no , you don &apos;t .
uh , hey , what &apos;s sheldon supposed to be ?
oh , he &apos;s the doppler effect .
yes . it &apos;s the apparent change in the frequency of a wave
caused by relative motion between the source of the wave and the observer .
oh , sure , i see it now .
the doppler effect .
all right , i got to shower .
you guys , um , make yourselves comfortable .
okay .
see ? people get it .
by odin &apos;s beard , this is good chex mix .
no , thanks . peanuts .
i can &apos;t afford to swell up in these tights .
i &apos;m confused .
if there &apos;s no costume parade , what are we doing here ?
we &apos;re socializing , meeting new people .
telepathically ?
oh , hey , when did you get here ?
hi .
penny is wearing the worst catwoman costume i &apos;ve ever seen .
and that includes halle berry &apos;s .
she &apos;s not catwoman . she &apos;s just a generic cat .
and that &apos;s the kind of sloppy costuming
which results from a lack of rules and competion .
hey , guys , check out the sexy nurse .
i believe it &apos;s time for me to turn my head and cough .
what is your move ?
i &apos;m going to use the mirror technique .
she brushes her hair back , i brush my hair back ...
she shrugs , i shrug .
subconsciously she &apos;s thinking , &quot; we &apos;re in sync . we belong together . &quot;
where do you get this stuff ?
you know , psychology journals , internet research ,
and there &apos;s this great show on vh @-@ 1 about how to pick up girls .
oh , if only i had his confidence .
i have such difficulty speaking to women , or around women ...
or at times even effeminate men .
if that &apos;s a working stethoscope ,
maybe you &apos;d like to hear my heart skip a beat ?
no , thanks .
no , seriously , you can.i have transient idiopathic arrhythmia .
i want to get to know penny &apos;s friends ,
i just ... i don &apos;t know how to talk to these people .
well , i actually might be able to help .
how so ?
like jane goodall observing the apes ,
i initially saw their interactions as confusing and unstructured .
but patterns emerge .
they have their own language , if you will .
go on .
well , it seems that the newcomer approaches the existing group with the greeting ,
&quot; how wasted am i ? &quot;
which is met with an approving chorus of &quot; dude . &quot;
then what happens ?
that &apos;s as far as i &apos;ve gotten .
this is ridiculous .
i &apos;m jumping in .
good luck .
no , you &apos;re coming with me .
oh , i hardly think so .
oh , come on .
aren &apos;t you afraid i &apos;ll embarrass you ?
yes ; but i need a wing man .
all right , but if we &apos;re going to use flight metaphors ,
i &apos;m much more suited to being the guy from the faa analyzing wreckage .
hi .
hi . hello .
so what are you supposed to be ?
me ? i &apos;ll give you a hint .
a choo @-@ choo train ?
close !
a brain damaged choo @-@ choo train ?
how wasted am i ?
i still don &apos;t get it .
i &apos;m the doppler effect .
okay , if that &apos;s some sort of learning disability ,
i think it &apos;s very insensitive .
why don &apos;t you just tell people you &apos;re a zebra ?
well , why don &apos;t you just tell people you &apos;re one of the seven dwarves ?
because i &apos;m frodo .
yes , well , i &apos;m the doppler effect .
oh , no .
what ?
that &apos;s penny &apos;s ex @-@ boyfriend .
what do you suppose he &apos;s doing here ?
besides disrupting the local gravity field .
if he were any bigger , he &apos;d have moons orbiting him .
oh , snap .
so , i guess we &apos;ll be leaving now .
why should we leave ?
for all we know he crashed the party and penny doesn &apos;t even want him here .
you have a backup hypothesis ?
maybe they want to be friends .
or maybe she wants to be friends and he wants something more .
then he and i are on equal ground .
yes , but you &apos;re much closer to it than he is .
look , if this was 1,500 years ago ,
by virtue of his size and strength ,
kurt would be entitled to his choice of female partners .
and male partners , animal partners , large primordial eggplants--
pretty much whatever tickled his fancy .
yes , but our society has undergone a paradigm shift .
in the information age , sheldon ,
you and i are the alpha males .
we shouldn &apos;t have to back down .
true .
why don &apos;t you text him that and see if he backs down ?
no .
i &apos;m going to assert my dominance face @-@ to @-@ face .
face @-@ to @-@ face ? are you going to wait for him to sit down ,
or are you going to stand on the coffee table ?
hello , penny .
hello , kurt .
oh , hey , guys , are you having a good time ?
given the reaction to my costume ,
this party is a scathing indictment of the american education system .
what , you &apos;re a zebra , right ?
yet another child left behind .
and what are you supposed to be , an elf ?
no , i &apos;m a hobbit .
what &apos;s the difference ?
a hobbit is a mortal halfling inhabitant of middle earth ,
whereas an elf is an immortal , tall warrior .
so why the hell would you want to be a hobbit ?
because he &apos;s neither tall nor immortal
and none of us could be the flash .
well , whatever .
why don &apos;t you go hop off on a quest ?
i &apos;m talking to penny here .
i think we &apos;re all talking to penny here .
i &apos;m not . no offense .
okay , maybe you didn &apos;t hear me .
go away .
all right , kurt , be nice .
oh , i am being nice .
right , little buddy ?
kurt .
okay .
i understand your impulse to try to physically intimidate me .
i mean , you can &apos;t compete with me on an intellectual level
so you &apos;re driven to animalistic puffery .
you calling me a puffy animal ?
of course not . no , he &apos;s not .
you &apos;re not , right , leonard ?
no , i said &quot; animalistic . &quot;
of course we &apos;re all animals ,
but some of us have climbed a little higher on the evolutionary tree .
if he understands that , you &apos;re in trouble .
so , what , i &apos;m unevolved ?
you &apos;re in trouble .
you know , you use a lot of big words for such a little dwarf .
okay , kurt , please .
penny , it &apos;s okay . i can handle this .
i am not a dwarf ,
i &apos;m a hobbit .
a hobbit .
are misfiring neurons in your hippocampus preventing the conversion
from short @-@ term to long @-@ term memory ?
okay , now you &apos;re starting to make me mad .
a homo habilis discovering his opposable thumbs says what ?
what ?
i think i &apos;ve made my point .
yeah ? how about i make a point out of your pointy little head ?
let me remind you , while my moral support is absolute ,
in a physical confrontation , i will be less than useless .
there &apos;s not going to be a confrontation .
in fact , i doubt if he can even spell &quot; confrontation . &quot;
c @-@ o @-@ n ...
frontation !
kurt , put him down this instant !
he started it !
i don &apos;t care . i &apos;m finishing it.put him down !
fine .
you &apos;re one lucky little leprechaun .
he &apos;s a hobbit !
i got your back .
leonard , are you okay ?
yeah , i &apos;m fine .
it &apos;s good , it &apos;s a good party , thanks for having us .
it &apos;s just getting a little late , so ...
oh , okay .
all right , well , thank you for coming .
happy halloween .
if it &apos;s any consolation ,
i thought that homo habilis line really put him in his place .
what &apos;s that ?
tea .
when people are upset ,
the cultural convention is to bring them hot beverages .
there , there .
you want to talk about it ?
no .
good .
&quot; there , there &quot; was really all i had .
good night , sheldon .
good night , leonard .
hey , leonard ?
hi , penny .
hey , i just wanted to make sure you were okay .
i &apos;m fine .
i am so sorry about what happened .
it &apos;s not your fault .
yes , it is .
that &apos;s why i broke up with him .
he always does stuff like that .
so why was he at your party ?
well , i ran into him last week and he was just all apologetic about how he &apos;s changed .
and he was just going on and on and ...
i believed him and i &apos;m an idiot
because i always believe guys like that .
and i can &apos;t go back to my party because he &apos;s there .
and know you don &apos;t want to hear this and i &apos;m upset
and i &apos;m really drunk and i just want to ...
there , there .
god , what is wrong with me ?
nothing , you &apos;re perfect .
i &apos;m not perfect .
yes , you are .
you really think so , don &apos;t you ?
penny ?
yeah ?
how much have you had to drink tonight ?
just ... a lot .
are you sure that your being drunk and your being angry with kurt
doesn &apos;t have something to do with what &apos;s going on here ?
it might .
boy , you &apos;re really smart .
yeah , i &apos;m a frickin &apos; genius .
leonard , you are so great .
why can &apos;t all guys be like you ?
because if all guys were like me ,
the human race couldn &apos;t survive .
i should probably go .
probably .
thank you .
that &apos;s right , you saw what you saw .
that &apos;s how we roll in the shire .
coming .
hey , have you seen koothrappali ?
he &apos;s not here .
maybe the avengers summoned him .
he &apos;s not the marvel comics thor , he &apos;s the original norse god .
thank you for the clarification .
i &apos;m supposed to give him a ride home .
well , i &apos;m sure he &apos;ll be fine .
he has his hammer .
i have to say , you are an amazing man .
you &apos;re gentle , and passionate .
