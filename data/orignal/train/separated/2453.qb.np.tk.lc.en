if stefan wants to save sarah &apos;s life ,
all he has to do is shut his humanity off .
stefan without his humanity is one artery away
from stefan the ripper .
your mother is alive ?
in a prison world of 1903 .
and you believe that i can reconnect
stefan with his humanity ?
pack your bags .
i &apos;ll alert the others .
she has a vampire dollhouse .
they &apos;re not coming .
they are my family .
i will leave you here to rot .
we &apos;ll come back for them .
we &apos;re never going back there , right ?
no , we &apos;re not .
you &apos;ve been a pawn in a game
that i &apos;ve now lost interest in playing .
you &apos;re no ordinary girl , sarah salvatore .
why would you call me that ?
i have something for you .
the cure to vampirism .
i knew you wanted it for elena .
what if i don &apos;t want it for her now ?
ok .
oh , come on .
ok . who &apos;s messing with me ?
chris , are you up there ?
dick .
oh , god .
chris ? chris ?
are you booing me ?
i scared him .
i scared you , right ,
with the whole chair flippy
and the bottle thing ?
who are you people ?
i &apos;m caroline , this is stefan ,
and that--mmm-- was delicious .
taste .
what &apos;s going on ?
well , caroline and i had a little bet
that she would scare you to death .
like , literally scare you to death .
but you have to understand
this is her first time messing with somebody ,
so she didn &apos;t realize the whole dead body shock @-@ drop thing
is a complete cliche .
cliche ? this guy was my friend .
well , then why aren &apos;t you freaking out ,
a panic attack , heart attack ?
come on . give me something .
i don &apos;t think you heard me .
you &apos;re having a heart attack .
what are you--
my--my chest . what &apos;s happening ?
she &apos;s cheating .
that &apos;s what &apos;s happening .
please help me .
all right . just relax . it &apos;s mental .
you only think you &apos;re having a heart attack .
now your throat &apos;s tightening .
you can &apos;t breathe .
oh , my god !
are those spiders all over your body ?
look at that .
i won .
poor guy was so scared
that he died of a heart attack .
no . that &apos;s not fair .
technically , he died of a loophole .
a win is a win .
so you know what we do now .
yes , unfortunately , i do .
karaoke .
so you drag me out of a hospital bed ,
waste a tank of gas driving around all night
just to bring me to a house
in the middle of nowhere ?
as soon as this door opens ,
you are not my problem anymore .
when have i ever been your problem ?
since your great @-@ great @-@ great uncle stefan
nearly got you killed .
what ?
it &apos;s time for you to meet your real family .
hello ?
are you looking for my son ?
my mistake .
i &apos;m sorry . have--have we--
i &apos;ve got the wrong house .
terribly sorry to disturb you .
what the hell was that ?
i &apos;ve met that woman before in 1903 .
what ? !
she &apos;s the one who turned me into a vampire .
do you smell something ?
mom &apos;s cooking .
is that bacon ?
yeah , or some baby she abducted from a nearby village .
she can hear us .
you have to give her a chance
just like i gave you one .
she &apos;s your mother .
no . she is a tool to get stefan &apos;s humanity back
because there is no doubt that he and caroline are
fangs deep in bodies right now ,
so the sooner we get our supernatural born killers
out of circulation , the better .
have you seen my t @-@ shirt ?
i prefer you without one .
i &apos;m not so sure your mom would feel the same way .
take mine .
this was always damon &apos;s favorite--
&quot; eggie in baskie . &quot;
doesn &apos;t taste like i remember .
well , you were human the last time you tasted it .
our tastes change over time .
but , elena , you &apos;re fairly new at this , aren &apos;t you ?
i turned a few years ago .
you ever miss it , being human ?
sometimes .
so if i understood correctly ,
um , in order to free my companions
from that place where i was trapped ,
we &apos;ll need the magical device .
the ascendant .
yes . the ascendant . where is that ?
safe . very safe .
and we &apos;ll also need a celestial event .
we &apos;ll have to do some digging , yeah .
be patient . they take time .
they &apos;re very rare .
there &apos;s a full moon coming up . will that work ?
if not , the lyrids meteor shower is in two weeks .
well , look at you .
if you &apos;re not a one @-@ woman &quot; farmer &apos;s almanac . &quot;
actually , i took your advice ,
and i &apos;ve been dabbling on stefan &apos;s computer .
what a wondrous invention-- all that knowledge .
and videos of cats riding robot vacuum cleaners .
everything ok ?
it &apos;s jo . someone &apos;s been attacking people at whitmore .
let me guess-- one of them &apos;s blond ,
and the other one liked turning people
into human pez dispensers .
that &apos;s exactly what i &apos;m gonna go find out .
thank you so much for breakfast .
who is that woman ,
and how do you even know who my family is ?
how do i not know this ?
because your uncle stefan compelled you to forget ,
to keep you a secret from your other uncle-- damon--
after he killed your parents ,
and you would have shared their fate
had it not been for your other uncle .
that &apos;s who you were taking me to ?
well , actually , no .
the good brother recently went bad ,
and i was hoping to leave you in the care of the bad brother ,
who actually is less bad now than the good brother .
i don &apos;t understand any of this .
yeah . look . i can try repeating it , luv ,
but it won &apos;t be any clearer the second time .
look . you wanted to know who that woman is ?
she &apos;s the most dreadful person i &apos;ve ever met .
no sick passengers !
i have a ticket .
i &apos;ve paid .
oh , yeah ? well , we &apos;re not running a sick ward .
there &apos;s a doctor on that ship .
he can help me .
get lost , mate ,
before you infect us all with your consumption .
who are you ?
someone who sees you need a doctor .
well , i--i appreciate that ,
but even if i could get past quarantine ,
i seem to have lost my ticket .
i can be of some help with that .
come . we don &apos;t have much time .
i thought i was on my way to a new life ,
aided by the classiest woman i &apos;d ever met .
by the time the ship docked in new york harbor ,
every soul on board was dead ,
including me .
you &apos;re going to forget everything you know about your real family .
you &apos;re going to wake up safe in your dorm ,
having forgotten you ever heard the name salvatore .
or you &apos;re finally gonna tell me the whole story .
you &apos;re on vervain .
yeah .
your friend matt stopped by the hospital ,
gave me some .
* well , you &apos;re a real tough cookie . *
* with a long history , *
* of breaking little hearts like the one in me . *
* that &apos;s ok , let &apos;s see how you do it . *
* put up your dukes , and let &apos;s get down to it . *
* hit me with your best shot . *
* why don &apos;t you hit me with your best shot ? *
* hit me with your best shot . *
hey , taylor swift .
we &apos;re trying to study here .
where &apos;s the manager in this place ?
someone ask for a manager ?
i didn &apos;t break his ribs .
he got the wind knocked out of him .
guy was out for 20 seconds .
maybe he &apos;s not cut out for a tactical training program .
we &apos;re not there to bust up keggers .
you want some food ?
&quot; you want some food , officer lockwood ? &quot;
dork .
* hit me with your best shot . *
* why don &apos;t you hit me with your best shot ? *
* come on , hit me with your best shot . *
* fire away @-@ ay . *
what did we just walk into ?
oh , look . it &apos;s the police officers in training .
are you guys here to arrest us ?
you can go away now .
what the hell are you doing ?
i &apos;m just enjoying the music .
you guys want next song ?
we should get out of here .
no . stay .
caroline &apos;s taking requests .
here . text elena .
tell her we &apos;re headed to campus to check it out .
see those letters ?
think of it as a tiny typewriter .
you &apos;re right .
&quot; my dearest elena , i hope this finds you well . &quot;
no , no . short and sweet .
just &quot; headed to campus . &quot;
yeah . then when we find them ,
i &apos;ll take care of caroline ,
you look stefan right in the eyes .
and i will return him to the man he used to be .
exactly .
and once we &apos;ve done that ,
then we will go rescue my friends ?
sure .
i know how terribly concerned you are about that .
how shall i end it , with an &quot; i love you &quot; ?
knock yourself out .
you do love her , don &apos;t you ?
not that it &apos;s any of your business ,
but , yes , i do , and she loves me .
we &apos;re in the love .
and you &apos;re afraid you &apos;ll ruin all that
if you give her the cure .
last night when your friend bonnie was over ...
you spied on me ?
well , i didn &apos;t mean to eavesdrop .
i &apos;m just not used to hearing other voices . i ...
really ?
couldn &apos;t help but listen ,
and it &apos;s not every day that one hears
something so rare as the cure for vampirism .
well , let &apos;s not bring this up to anyone else , ok ?
you mean , don &apos;t bring it up with elena .
i don &apos;t even know if she wants the cure .
yet you fear she might
and that if you give it to her you &apos;ll lose her .
we &apos;re more alike than you care to admit , damon .
neither of us can bear the thought of being alone .
he &apos;s unconscious ,
but i gave him some of my blood ,
and his vitals have stabilized .
the more these victims pile up ,
the harder it is to hide the reason they &apos;re here .
yeah , i know . that &apos;s why i &apos;m hoping
that damon and his mom find them soon .
i &apos;m sorry . did you just say damon &apos;s mom ?
isn &apos;t she dead ?
no . she was trapped in a 1903 prison world ,
where kai is currently trapped .
kai is in a 1903 prison world ?
i &apos;m sorry . has nobody told you this ?
i &apos;m on hour 13 of a 12 @-@ hour shift .
maybe someone could have shot me a text .
i--sorry .
so kai &apos;s gone ?
as in for good .
oh , that &apos;s amazing news .
like , really amazing news .
you &apos;re pregnant .
i was wondering why you switched to decaf ,
especially while working a 13 @-@ hour shift .
the last thing this baby needs is an uncle psychopath .
you and alaric having a baby .
i ...
jo , this is-- this is amazing .
i &apos;m so happy for you .
little old you did all this ?
you &apos;ve made a mistake .
i know , starting with trusting my vampire stalker ,
who arranged for me to befriend some blue @-@ eyed bartender ,
also i could witness him getting run over ,
and you playing the part of the hero .
while you were sleeping , i went through your phone ,
saw your texts to matt .
well , that saves me an awkward conversation .
i &apos;m an idiot for ever trusting you .
don &apos;t beat yourself up .
i remember what it was like to be so naive .
the bacilli have spread to most of your lungs ,
carving out cavities in the tissue .
the bleeding will continue .
you can stop it ?
i believe so , but the dosage required
at this late stage is expensive .
payment isn &apos;t an issue ,
provided your curative is effective .
i assure you it is .
how many people have you saved with this ?
be truthful .
none . i promise them health
and sell them lavender mixed with castor oil .
what ?
why are you saying that ?
i thought you could help me .
he lied .
what is this man &apos;s true prognosis ?
he &apos;ll die within the week .
chances are , he &apos;ll never see land again .
leave us .
you should go , as well .
i do not wish to repay your acts of kindness by affecting you .
you can &apos;t .
i &apos;ve already had consumption .
how did you survive ?
i didn &apos;t .
what are you , an angel ?
look . we listened to you sing ,
we clapped our hands .
can we go now ?
let &apos;s play caroline trivia .
i don &apos;t even know what that is .
oh , sure you do !
you both dated me ,
which means you should know everything about me ,
so i &apos;m gonna ask you some questions about myself ,
and whoever answers them right lives .
you &apos;re sick .
when is my birthday ?
tyler !
october 10 .
very good .
all right , matt . your turn .
what is my favorite color ?
that &apos;s a trick question .
you don &apos;t have a favorite color .
correct !
ok . now a tie breaker .
whoever answers first wins .
what was my mom &apos;s final memory before she died ?
how would we even begin to know that ?
oh , i &apos;m sure i mentioned it at some point .
no , you didn &apos;t .
come on . ticktock , ticktock .
judges are waiting for a final answer .
what was my mom &apos;s final memory
before she kicked the bucket ?
well , looks like ,
whitmore &apos;s gonna need a new philosophy t.a.
your mom was teaching you how to ride a bike .
bingo ! and stefan wins ,
which means you two lose ,
which isn &apos;t that bad actually
because now it just means we get to kill the both of you .
judging from the victims ,
they started at the library ,
they took out a couple security guards near the football field ,
and then they wandered over to the movie theater .
you know what the most shocking part of all this is ?
that i &apos;m not shocked .
doctor 101--
becoming desensitized goes with the territory .
actually , the reason why i &apos;m not shocked is because
i &apos;ve been in their shoes ,
and i was just as bad ,
and this is all just one big horrible reminder
that there &apos;s always gonna be a part of me
that &apos;s capable of doing what they &apos;re doing .
but you &apos;re not gonna let that happen .
you &apos;re gonna be too busy running your small @-@ town family practice
and curing little stevie from the chicken pox .
for a while maybe
until little stevie becomes teenage steven
and i haven &apos;t aged a day .
have you told damon about this ?
what do you mean ?
i saw how you reacted when you found out i was pregnant .
well , i--
and the next eternity of your life flashed before your eyes ,
and it scared the hell out of you .
i--i &apos;m just happy for you and alaric .
alaric , who used to be a vampire ,
now is a human having a kid .
have you discussed this with your boyfriend ?
he knows how i feel ,
but he also knows that there &apos;s nothing we can do to change that ,
so there &apos;s no point in dwelling .
ok .
so how do i know you &apos;re not the one who &apos;s been mind @-@ controlling me ,
making me believe this messed up family history .
you were ripped from the womb of a dead woman .
stefan compelled away the truth ,
but the emotional scars still linger .
how else do you explain your morbid fascinations , hmm ?
the--the hanging of mary surratt--heh--
is hardly a motivational poster , now is it ?
yeah . well , there &apos;s something about death that i find--
i don &apos;t know--
alluring ?
well , let me tell you ,
you can &apos;t truly appreciate death
until you &apos;ve stood at its precipice .
i haven &apos;t heard that song since i was a boy .
i know .
why are you doing this ?
is it so hard to believe someone could do you a kindness ?
i was abandoned at a workhouse at the age of 4 .
it &apos;s not a place known for its kindness .
i , too , know what it is to be tossed aside like rubbish .
i was sent to a sanatorium to rot , left to die ,
abandoned by my own husband ,
who prayed the end would come quickly not
so that i would be spared pain and misery
but so that he would be unburdened by me ,
but i was given a reprieve ,
and it was only once i was unshackled from a life that didn &apos;t want me
that i found my true family .
is that where you &apos;re heading , to meet them ?
no . i could never bear to be apart from them .
they &apos;re here , traveling with me .
like you and i , they &apos;re outcasts .
you could join us .
you &apos;d never be alone again .
it would appear the end is coming .
or the beginning .
drink this , lorenzo .
if your brother &apos;s on the hunt ,
he won &apos;t be staying in one place .
yeah ? well , we have to start somewhere .
elena said she treated some kid
who was attacked coming out of modern european history .
well , well .
mother knows best .
elena said they &apos;re at scull bar .
come on .
we have yet to discuss what we &apos;ll do if stefan fails to remember me .
what , are you kidding ? you &apos;re his mother .
of course , he &apos;s gonna remember you .
tell me you can do this .
what if i say the wrong thing ?
a century and a half is a long time to be away .
you &apos;ll be fine .
just channel whatever you were feeling when you came back to get us .
when i came back to get you ?
yeah . 1903 .
you found out we were vampires ,
you landed in new york harbor after a 40 @-@ year romp in europe ,
and you ...
you weren &apos;t coming to get us .
no . i wasn &apos;t .
i &apos;m sorry .
you can do this .
all we have to do is just try .
i have been trying , damon .
since i laid my eyes on you yesterday ,
i have been trying with all of my heart
to reconnect with the woman who was your mother ,
to remember what it felt like to mourn
you and your brother after i was banished by your father .
after i was turned ,
the only thing more powerful
than the longing i felt for you
was the fear of what i would do
if i ever saw you again .
so i stayed away .
i had to find others
who could help me find my way back to myself ,
and ... by the time my new family
helped me to do that ,
everything i felt for my old family ,
for you and your brother
was gone .
i hate that i can &apos;t make myself feel more .
i &apos;m so sorry .
heads i kill tyler , and tails i kill matt .
deal ?
sounds good to me .
looks like somebody &apos;s angry .
he &apos;s a wolf . it &apos;s his resting face .
you wonder why everyone hates vampires ?
look at you , messing with people for no reason .
that &apos;s really brave .
ty , what are you doing ?
are you serious ?
what &apos;s wrong , stefan ?
not used to people fighting back ?
no . actually , i &apos;m just not used to people being this stupid .
all right , ty , stop .
stefan , he &apos;s sorry .
ty , stop . he will kill you .
see that little vein in his forehead ?
i used to think it was so sexy ,
but now i &apos;m pretty sure
it &apos;s just all the blood leaving his brain .
screw you , caroline .
come on .
either of you , come at me .
ty , stop !
hey , caroline . i will gladly kill him for you ,
but i know what a jerk he was during your relationship ,
so if you want--
i want .
come on , tyler .
i dare you .
ty , stop . she will kill you .
get out of here , matt .
nice going , tyler .
she flat out told you that she didn &apos;t love you ?
well , she was her overly proper self ,
but , yeah , that was the gist of it ,
but , hey , you know ,
i &apos;m not planning on honoring my end of the plan
by jail @-@ breaking her friends ,
so ... figure we &apos;re even .
damon .
nah . it &apos;s fine .
150 years is a long time to care .
says the guy who pined for katherine pierce
for over a century and a half .
it &apos;s ok to feel hurt , damon .
lily was the second woman to abandon you .
says the woman who never has .
look . you can sit here and flirt with me ,
or you can help me come up with a plan &quot; b &quot;
because lily &apos;s a no @-@ go .
stefan doesn &apos;t know how she feels .
stefan &apos;s also not a moron .
any chance your mom &apos;s a good liar ?
where the hell are you going ?
anywhere . i don &apos;t know .
just let me be .
no . now you listen .
i have one solution to this , and it &apos;s you ,
so you &apos;re gonna walk over to that bar ,
and you &apos;re gonna give the performance of your lifetime ,
or you can kiss your desiccated vampire family good @-@ bye .
understood ?
and what if i fail to bring him back ?
you won &apos;t fail .
i need to be assured that regardless
of the outcome with your brother today
i can trust you to help me get my people back .
i told you a hundred times we &apos;ll get them back .
and is that the truth ?
why would i lie ?
damon .
you have the power to give your greatest love
the human life she desires ,
and you are yet to be truthful with her .
showtime .
so some good samaritan vampire saves you from dying ,
gives you superstrength , mind control ,
and you never grow old .
sounds like a pretty good deal to me .
yeah . that &apos;s because you don &apos;t know about the hunger .
i was awakened by the deafening sound of waves
lapping against the ship ,
blinded by the faint glow of the northern lights .
every one of my senses intensified to the point of pain
but none more than the insatiable craving for blood .
what happened here ?
the woman who helped you ,
she killed them all .
everyone &apos;s dead .
where is she ?
i don &apos;t know .
she told me to come find you .
she wants you to feed on me
to complete your transition .
after feeding on the charlatan ,
i searched all over that ship for that woman ,
but she was gone .
her promises of a new life and a new family were lies .
she made me a monster
and then abandoned me .
for what reason ?
who knows ? probably some sick game .
like the one you were playing with me .
exactly .
the goal was the same .
i wanted to do to you what had been done to me .
to make you a monster .
i &apos;m sorry , matt . come on .
you can &apos;t die on me , man .
so for those of us keeping score ,
if matt dies ,
are you gonna start peeing on fire hydrants again ?
that &apos;s a very good question .
i mean , if all that rage made you think
that you could take us both ,
maybe this is nature &apos;s way of reconnecting you
with your true self .
shut up !
who &apos;s that ?
it &apos;s my mother .
get him out of here .
here . take my car .
come here , man .
so ... you have a mother ?
i had a mom .
she died , so whoever this is
is damon &apos;s lame attempt to get my humanity back on .
let me guess . then you get my humanity back on .
i don &apos;t think so .
sorry , stefan , but thanks for the head start .
elena ! we need help !
oh , my god ! matt !
it &apos;s ok . you &apos;ll be fine .
no .
matt , take the damn blood .
i said i don &apos;t want it . i want a doctor .
but--
where &apos;s jo ?
matt !
help !
what just happened ?
here . let me help you .
i &apos;m sure you have many questions .
well , the fact that you haven &apos;t aged a day
answers the big one .
i &apos;m a ripper .
all of the guilt you &apos;ve carried for your lack of control ,
it &apos;s my fault , not yours .
you get it from me .
that &apos;s why i had to leave .
i was so new to the bloodlust ,
i was afraid i would hurt you and your brother .
the last time i saw you
was the day of my funeral .
you weren &apos;t imagining it .
i was your angel .
then tell him
that you wish you could have seen him grow up .
if only i &apos;d been there
to see you grow into a young man ,
to protect you from your father &apos;s temper ,
but i was so ashamed of the things that i &apos;d done ,
of what i &apos;d become ,
and by the time i got my appetite under control
and was coming back for you and your brother ,
i was hunted down and banished to a prison world by the gemini .
the one thing that helped you get through
being trapped in that awful place ...
was the hope of seeing my sons again .
i know there are no words
that make up for me abandoning you ,
but we have all of eternity for me to try .
&quot; your angel has returned to you . &quot;
your angel has returned to you ,
and i will never leave you again .
mother .
my sweet , sweet boy .
how &apos;d you find her ?
on the list of things to be worrying about ,
she &apos;s not one of them .
you get a night , stefan ,
a night to beat yourself up ,
do your shame spiral ,
and then you have to go after caroline .
i don &apos;t need a night .
i &apos;ll find her .
you refusing the pain meds , too ?
no .
then why are you refusing my blood ?
do you know how many times i &apos;ve died
or nearly died ?
most of those times were at the hands
of people i thought were my friends .
i &apos;m sorry ,
not people -- vampires .
matt
don &apos;t give me the
&quot; we &apos;re not all like that &quot; speech , elena ,
because you are .
just one flip of a switch away .
that &apos;s not what i was gonna say .
i actually think you have every right to be mad ...
but why won &apos;t you let me make it better ?
i can &apos;t say that i hate vampires
and then use them when it &apos;s to my advantage .
i can &apos;t have it both ways , elena .
that &apos;s just how it is to me .
good . now that the vervain &apos;s out of your system ,
how does southampton sound ?
well , i may as well compel you a nice place to disappear to .
or you could give me the choice you never had .
look . you said it yourself .
you do this , you &apos;re only making it worse .
ah , but you &apos;ll be safe .
what if i swore never to seek out the salvatores ?
from what you &apos;ve told me ,
i don &apos;t want any part of my real family .
have a nice life , sarah nelson .
well , matt lives to hate vampires another day ,
stefan &apos;s on caroline duty ,
and i just introduced mom to uber .
taking bets on which one goes south first .
i want to throw jo a baby shower .
forgot to hit your turn signal for that segue .
jo &apos;s pregnancy &apos;s
the best news that we &apos;ve had in a little while ,
and i feel like i didn &apos;t react in the way that i should have .
why not ?
because i think i was -- i don &apos;t know .
jealous ?
yeah . a little .
i mean , i &apos;ve always wanted a family
before , you know .
so it &apos;s kind of a bummer of a reminder
that that &apos;s never gonna happen for me .
but i get to have a life with you ,
which is also what i &apos;ve always wanted ,
so it &apos;ll be good , ok ?
i just had to let myself be sad for a minute .
what if things could be different ?
what if you could change everything .
they &apos;re not , and i can &apos;t .
nothing &apos;s changed .
i love you .
i love you , too .
this better be important .
so i called my dad to let him know that kai &apos;s gone ,
but all he wants to know
is where the ascendant is .
we have to destroy it .
why ?
before you answer that ,
i should probably skip to the part
where i already gave it to lily .
what ? ! you promised bonnie that--
it doesn &apos;t matter .
you need to get it back now .
tell me .
before the 1900s ,
your mother fell in with a group of witches
that were cast out of the gemini coven .
they were known as heretics , siphoners like kai ,
but not just that .
lily turned them ,
resulting in creatures that are both witch and vampire .
but that &apos;s not possible .
vampires can &apos;t be witches .
these are witches that have magic
only when they siphon power from another source .
as vampires ...
they have a constant source .
they can siphon off of themselves .
they were on their way to destroy the gemini ,
but the coven got to them first ,
put them into exile .
heretics are ruthless--
vampires with witch power ,
an aberration of nature .
they can never be allowed to escape .
imagine kai with the bloodlust of a vampire .
now imagine 6 of them .
