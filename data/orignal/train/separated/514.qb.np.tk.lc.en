the job
let &apos;s go , let &apos;s go . come on , keep up , bro .
yes , sir .
pop quiz . what are the 3 smells
that give away methamphetamine production ?
uh , ammonia , ether , and ...
poop . usually human , not always .
and don &apos;t spill your coffee unless you want the roaches
to come out and ask if it &apos;s french roast .
he had these fangs . i saw him--i saw-- i see demons ...
what about her ?
never take statements from people speaking in tongues .
oh , yeah . only a strung @-@ out street level crank slinger would do this .
would he also do that ?
well , that &apos;s new .
but given the range of ocd behaviors
of your average meth addict / manufacturer ,
it &apos;s not completely crazy either .
there &apos;s no visible wounds .
this junkie od &apos;d on his own supply , case closed .
no , detective . this man was murdered .
who the hell are you ?
ssa david rossi with the behavioral analysis unit .
i think your captain told you we &apos;d be coming by .
he might have . isn &apos;t there supposed to be a whole team of you ?
yeah . we &apos;re a little short @-@ handed right now .
what &apos;s that ?
that &apos;s our unknown subject &apos;s first kill from two days ago .
same face paint .
i don &apos;t think so . if that was in my city , i &apos;d&apos;ve heard about it .
it didn &apos;t happen here . it happened in albany , new york .
albany ? so this guy traveled all the way
from albany to here ? why ?
we &apos;ll have to answer that question with our profile .
profile . wonderful .
look , agent , your telling me this perp has mommy issues
isn &apos;t gonna help me close this thing .
couldn &apos;t agree with you more , because this guy
doesn &apos;t have mommy issues , and if he did ,
he &apos;d probably be killing women .
what else can you tell about him ?
what else can we tell about him ?
this is his .
you two together , i take it ?
ssa derek morgan .
how do you know ? there &apos;s needles everywhere .
miss , would you use this ?
no . that would blow out my delicate varicose veins .
thank you , sweetheart .
this syringe is far too big to shoot up with .
the unsub definitely left it behind .
now , if we &apos;re lucky , we might be able to get some dna off of it ,
but this guy &apos;s so good , i doubt we &apos;re gonna get that lucky .
detective , unless you have any objection ,
we &apos;ve asked your captain to transport the corpse
back to the fbi crime lab in quantico .
be my guest , but you haven &apos;t told us
how we &apos;re we &apos;re gonna catch this guy .
you don &apos;t . he most likely has already left the state .
then who does ?
is it the same unsub ?
yeah .
two kills on two coasts in two days .
this guy &apos;s on a mission .
he &apos;s not gonna rest until he completes it .
then neither will we .
but we &apos;re down two profilers .
our 5 brains against his one . my money &apos;s still on us .
let &apos;s get to work .
hello ?
hello ?
it &apos;s just me .
i was told to give this to you .
can i go now ?
please ...
jesus help me .
pleasure in the job
puts perfection in the work . &quot;
aristotle .
we know for a fact that victim number one was bound and gagged ,
but it doesn &apos;t look like number two was .
windows in both residences were tampered with ,
so he knows how to get in and out undetected .
ok , that &apos;s impressive because aluminum foil is super crinkly .
i &apos;m sorry , i &apos;m not a profiler , i &apos;m doing my best .
no , it &apos;s a fair point . he snuck up on a tweaker
who probably hadn &apos;t slept in a couple of days .
m.o. said this guy &apos;s good at hunting .
cause of death ?
cardiac arrest , but dr. mertz
in the crime lab can &apos;t pin down how .
he might hide it under the face paint .
what we &apos;re assuming is ritual
could be a forensic countermeasure .
what do we know about the face paint ?
traditional greasepaint used by clowns ,
but applied to resemble a pulcinella .
oh , i totally know what that is ,
but i &apos;m gonna google it in case someone else doesn &apos;t .
sorry . the clown archetype that we recognize today
actually leads back to a 16th century
stage tradition called commedia dell &apos; arte ,
where actors wore masks to resemble their characters .
the pulcinella was the trickster character ,
usually without a voice .
he used a horn to make funny noises .
maybe the victims tricked him
and he &apos;s remaking them in death
how he saw them in life .
so this is a vendetta by the unsub and not a compulsion .
it &apos;s gonna make this guy really hard to profile .
all right , dave , keep working victimology .
morgan , stay on the m.o. and , reid , dig deeper into the ritual .
i &apos;ll be right back .
hey . how you feeling ?
good . good .
he just fell asleep , and will &apos;s with henry ,
so , i just wanted to reach out .
well , if i remember correctly , mom ,
you &apos;re supposed to sleep when the baby does .
right .
look , it &apos;s hard knowing that cases
are still coming in and i &apos;m not there .
do you want me to come back ?
do you want to come back ?
yes . just ...
not right now .
honestly , the jump from one kid to two is ... whew .
jj , take your time .
we &apos;re all doing jobs we don &apos;t normally do ,
but we &apos;ll manage .
you sure you don &apos;t need me ?
we do need you , it &apos;s just your family needs you more .
your job will be here when you &apos;re ready .
thank you .
sure . and keep sending the baby pictures , ok ?
well , as penelope says , already sent .
bye .
yes ?
sir , shall i send in the first--
uh , no , anderson , i want to talk to the whole group .
can i have everyone &apos;s attention , please .
the bau is working an active case ,
so this interview process may take some time .
does anyone need to return to their field office ?
no , sir .
good . dr. lewis , we &apos;ll start with you .
absolutely .
this way .
have a seat , dr. lewis .
thank you . and you can call me tara .
the only person that calls me dr. lewis is my father ,
and that &apos;s only when he &apos;s bragging and / or drunk .
so your a.d. in the san francisco field office
says that you &apos;re the best field agent he &apos;s ever worked with .
i think forensic psychologists tend to stand out at the bureau .
other agents like it when i make sure
the bad guys they &apos;ve arrested
are actually found competent to stand trial .
how did you do that with herzog ?
he was a tough nut to crack in our prison interviews .
but then i thought , why not take on the affect of his wife ?
facial expressions , voice patterns , cadence .
once i did that , he told me everything i needed to know ,
specifically , that he was not crazy .
well , you &apos;re the only applicant
with this much clinical evaluative experience ,
but it &apos;s not really relevant to what we do here .
look , i get it . interviewing a serial killer
from the safety of a prison cell
isn &apos;t the same as hunting them , right ?
it &apos;s just a different skill set .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m here .
for 12 years i &apos;ve studied these men after they were caught .
now i want to catch them .
just tell me what you need in a profiler , agent hotchner .
i need you to wait a few minutes .
i &apos;ll be right back .
i can wait .
it took me two victims to make sure
i was seeing what i was seeing and not going crazy .
you found trace elements of a drug in their blood ?
not a drug , and not trace elements .
a lot of it .
corn syrup solids , soy fiber ,
medium @-@ chain triglycerides .
is that a nutritional supplement ?
the kind you drink . only he injects them with it .
under the face paint , as you thought .
the syringe you found was his murder weapon .
so once he injects it , it causes a massive embolism , right ?
an agonizing one .
it &apos;s like injecting cement .
it could take up to an hour before they die .
all right , so play this out for me . who would drink this stuff ?
senior citizens . anyone having trouble nutritionally .
somebody who can &apos;t eat solid foods .
absolutely .
well , this doesn &apos;t clear up much .
vic number one was a divorced dad
who got custody of his kids .
and number two was the local drug supplier .
so if the question is , what connects these two guys ,
the answer is , nothing .
and we never would have made the connection
if it weren &apos;t for the face paint .
which begs the question , why do it at all ?
to taunt us , feel superior .
it &apos;s obviously a message ,
and my assumption is that it has something to do with the mouth ,
&apos;cause look at this .
the colors of the pulcinella are oddly inverted .
traditionally the character has a black face but a white jaw .
he &apos;s painting it the other way around .
you said that this character
was the precursor to today &apos;s clown
because he couldn &apos;t speak , right ?
yeah , that &apos;s right .
so , he was also the first mime , too .
very much so .
which means ...
he has a feeding port in his stomach ?
the nutritional supplement that dr. mertz found in both victims
would be ideal for someone who couldn &apos;t eat normally .
so if the unsub sustained an injury to the jaw ,
it would also suggest that he &apos;s unable to speak .
hence the pulcinella mask .
it &apos;s his way of communicating .
ok , so what is he trying to say ?
well , let &apos;s work our way back to that based on what we know .
we know this guy travels thousands of miles in two days .
so , he probably doesn &apos;t sleep .
he &apos;s able to sneak into a suburban house
or a drug den undetected .
he overwhelms his victims silently and then injects them .
and then as they lay there dying over the course of an hour ,
he simply sits over them
and leaves them a highly symbolic message ,
but it &apos;s a precise message .
his victims are seizing up right in front of him ,
but this guy does not miss a brush stroke .
this is a man who &apos;s been around death before .
it doesn &apos;t faze him .
who else would leave this type of message ?
drug cartels .
cutting the tongues out of snitches
and the hands off of thieves .
the mafia , sleeping with the fishes and all that .
he &apos;s a contract killer .
only a hit man would be this good ,
but his message-- it &apos;s not for us .
it &apos;s for his customers .
please , please don &apos;t do this .
干的
i don &apos;t know--i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
why are you doing this to me ?
that--that wasn &apos;t me .
i would never-- i wouldn &apos;t do that .
we had a deal . i respected that deal .
you have to believe me .
no .
what have you got , garcia ?
sir , i am in the middle
of my trademark top to tail background check
on our dearly departed brian taylor .
thus far he is spectacularly normal .
no suspicious behavior , no unsavory vices .
what about financials ? contract killings
usually involve some sort of unpaid debt .
oh , yeah , i checked that , too .
uh , he put $ 40,000 in an escrow .
maybe he got killed
trying to be upwardly mobile ?
when was the escrow set up ?
uh ... two months ago .
someone in taylor &apos;s life
died exactly two months ago . who was that ?
that would be his father .
and there was some animosity between them .
uh , let me check on that .
he was emancipated from his dad .
he claimed sexual abuse . it was never proven .
sir , how did you know that ?
because 40,000 wouldn &apos;t get
taylor a down payment in this neighborhood ,
but it is a competitive rate for a hit man .
hold up . are you saying our brian taylor &apos;s not so normal
because he hired a hit man ?
i think all of our victims did .
we need to deliver the profile .
right . sir , uh , to who are we gonna deliver it to ?
to the agents who want to join the bau .
we &apos;ll use our shorthandedness to our advantage .
c @-@ cool .
the unsub that we &apos;re looking for is a contract killer
who is doubling back to kill his former customers .
this man is highly skilled and well @-@ trained .
under no circumstances should he be engaged without back @-@ up .
so is this a case of organized crime tying up loose ends ?
organized crime &apos;s got nothing to do with this ,
at least not in the traditional sense .
in 2013 , the bureau took down the silk road network .
our initial assumption was that it was an encrypted
online market for illegal drugs , which it was ,
but upon further inspection , we were stunned
at the breadth of goods and services being traded online .
weapons , child porn , even hit men .
and the payment scheme was escrow based ,
in which the buyer would put down half as a deposit
and the other half when the seller delivered .
we &apos;ve now confirmed that all 3 victims
hired the unsub over the past year
through a similar escrow system .
so why is he killing his old clients ?
hit men don &apos;t leave a message unless you pay them to .
the exception is to leave a warning for customers or competitors .
this unsub suffered some sort of injury
to his jaw or voice , most likely as a result
of something these customers did .
the pulcinella mask is his statement on revenge and justice--
betray the oath between customer and contractor
and you pay the price .
now , normally a man with
this kind of defect would attract attention .
the fact that he hasn &apos;t indicates that he has deep pockets
and a network of resources at his disposal .
share this profile with
your local divisions and with law enforcement .
search for escrow payments to match the unsub to his clients .
one of those clients will be his next target .
thank you .
hey , al .
i &apos;m heading out .
did you finish that engine transfer on that jeep ?
i will tomorrow .
come on , don &apos;t dilly @-@ dally .
that guy calls , it &apos;s your ass i gotta kick .
wasn &apos;t it bob &apos;s ass last week ?
al &apos;s garage . i decide whose ass to kick .
hey , be sure to lock up !
don &apos;t be a smart @-@ ass . you lock up .
who is it ?
hello ?
hey , hey , speedy , slow your roll .
i am slow . that is the problem .
ok , you definitely don &apos;t have to beat me up .
just use your words and talk to me .
ok , do you remember 2001 ? not the movie , the year .
everyone was illegally downloading free music off of napster ?
i have no idea where this is going , but sure .
the government shuts it down ,
but that doesn &apos;t stop the online sharing world .
it just goes deeper underground .
and you have the same
headache on your hands trying to find this guy .
you understand me . come here .
i &apos;m following the digital breadcrumbs ,
but because the problem is this silk road bust
made online hit men and drug dealers
that much better at hiding .
ok , take this , for instance . it &apos;s the dummy corporation
the unsub uses for his escrow ,
and he never goes to the same place twice .
&apos;cause we would track it to him .
right . and this is where
i go into the very bad spinning out place .
what if there &apos;s a whole
network of professional killers out there ?
then we &apos;ll get &apos; em .
how ? how are you gonna profile a bunch of ones and zeroes .
we &apos;ll try . we all have to do jobs
that we don &apos;t normally do , right ?
come on , now , garcia , what if we look at the paper trail
from the opposite direction ?
walk me through it . speak up .
ok . cast a wide net over the past 6 months .
look for anyone who &apos;s ever set up an escrow .
well , i already did that . the numbers are astronomical .
39223条
ok , but did you eliminate the reputable corporations ?
the whole point is it &apos;s fly by night , right ?
mm @-@ hmm , and because of the housing market crash ,
6372条
there &apos;s still a ton out there .
we also have insider trader information .
the unsub charges 40k a hit .
oh . ho , that brings the numbers way down .
16条
i got 16 across the country .
ok . the way this operates
is the customer puts half down when he places the order
and the other half when the job is done .
ok . so two payments of 20,000 each .
1条
i don &apos;t believe it . we found our next victim .
see ? who says we can &apos;t profile the ones and zeroes ?
and he &apos;s in baltimore . that &apos;s right next door .
and we &apos;re gonna get there first .
nobody does it like you and me , baby girl . thank you .
that never gets old .
gentlemen , captain wilson , baltimore swat .
how do you want to do this , captain ?
we &apos;ll breach and clear .
when it &apos;s locked down , the site is yours .
sound good ?
all right .
police !
don &apos;t shoot ! do not shoot !
come out with your hands up .
that &apos;s gonna be real hard , real hard . look !
what &apos;s that you got in your hands ?
grenade !
grenade !
drop it !
drop it ! drop it !
i can &apos;t drop it !
i can &apos;t !
put your weapons down !
put your weapons down .
you mean that literally , don &apos;t you ?
you can &apos;t drop it .
yeah !
what did he use ? what did he use ? !
over there .
it &apos;s dried and set and he glued over the pin .
do you have any acetone ?
it &apos;s not gonna work . it &apos;s not gonna work .
reid , he &apos;s right . this is industrial acrylic .
it holds car parts together .
bomb squad &apos;s 10 minutes out .
i &apos;m gonna take out my men and set up a perimeter .
maybe we can still box this guy in .
we &apos;re staying .
all right , we &apos;re going block to block , gentlemen .
you gotta do something , ok ?
we will , we will , but you need to stay still .
stay still .
he--he pulled the pin . i &apos;m holding down this clamp here ,
but my hand is cramping ,
so you--just do something , all right ? !
morgan , 4 cars .
what about them ?
each car has a battery , right ?
each battery has an electrolyte solution
of 62 % water , 38 % sulfuric acid .
but , reid , that &apos;s not gonna work .
why not ?
because the acrylic will still stay bonded to the metal .
absolutely true ,
but it will also create a saponification effect on his flesh .
the grenade will literally slide out of his hand .
like a wet bar of soap .
of course there will be an intense burning sensation on the skin ,
and the smell will be horrendous .
you can &apos;t--you &apos;re not burning my hands !
you &apos;re not gonna do it !
stay still !
hey , listen , pal .
you got yourself into this mess ,
so unless you got a better idea , just shut up .
i don &apos;t understand . i just need to get through .
what &apos;s the situation here ?
i &apos;m trying to get home . i &apos;ve had a long day .
you check the trunk ?
all right , well , let the lady go home .
all right , let her through .
someone &apos;s gotta hold the grenade while this thing is
right ?
that &apos;s my job .
this is gonna hurt , but you &apos;ll survive .
is everybody ready ?
yeah . just watch your end , kid .
all right , my hand &apos;s on the lever .
all right , i need you to help me pull .
i &apos;ve got it .
here . we safe , rossi ?
yeah , we &apos;re good .
the lever &apos;s st--
run !
you guys ok ? anyone hurt ?
you ok ?
yeah , he &apos;s fine .
so here &apos;s what i figured out .
you tell me what i got wrong .
one ,
you set up an escrow and two days later your fiancee died .
two ,
the man who killed her just tried to blow us all up tonight .
how am i doing so far ?
i don &apos;t take kindly to being blown up .
it actually pisses me off .
if you help me with number two ,
i might help you with number one .
what do you want to know ?
who is he ?
i don &apos;t know .
where is he ?
i don &apos;t know .
who else is he going after ?
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;ll see you at sentencing .
anonymity was the whole point .
online names , encrypted emails .
but for some reason he kept tabs on me .
i didn &apos;t say quit talking .
the whole thing started about a month after ... you know .
i noticed the camera on my computer would turn itself on .
then i &apos;d get these weird facetime calls with no caller i.d.
that &apos;s called nerves .
that &apos;s what happens when you kill somebody .
i couldn &apos;t take that chance .
so i reached out to another guy ,
a friend of mine , to take care of it .
not quite the same level of professionalism ,
but ... good enough .
at least i thought .
let me get this straight .
you put a hit on a hit man .
but you went cheap .
i didn &apos;t have a lot of money left over .
you know what i &apos;m saying ?
so i pretended to be a new customer ,
telling our internet friend i needed a job done .
only it was a setup .
he was never supposed to see it coming ,
much less know who it was .
this setup , where did it happen ?
atlantic city .
ok , so , a week ago ,
this guy stumbles in to the atlantic city e.r. ,
having been shot in the jaw .
can &apos;t give them his name
&apos;cause of the whole shot in the mouth thing .
but his fingerprints lit up
the rome police database like a christmas tree .
italian . that explains the pulcinella influence .
yeah . they were able to get a name-- giuseppe montolo ,
but by the time jersey p.d. got there ,
montolo had been patched up and made his escape .
and now he &apos;s on some type of payback gig .
he has no idea who double @-@ crossed him ,
so now he &apos;s killing every customer
that he suspects might have done it .
i tried to use al &apos;s username
and password to flush out other clients ,
but they don &apos;t call it the darknet for nothing .
then we let it go . we &apos;re not going to catch him that way .
what other way is there ?
montolo changed his m.o. drastically with the last victim .
he went from up close and personal to collateral damage .
al blows himself up or we kill him .
either way it &apos;s a win @-@ win .
if he made that dramatic a shift , it was a mistake .
that &apos;s how we catch him .
you &apos;re--you &apos;re leaving ?
all right , then let &apos;s do this old school .
morgan , you took al &apos;s confession .
walk us through it like you &apos;re the unsub .
i got my victim on the ground ,
and i have the syringe in my hand .
i have total control over him . this is my moment .
i &apos;m gonna make him pay for what he did .
but al said he got a text .
i don &apos;t like what i see .
now i have to change my plan .
what was on that text ?
someone tipped him off .
he wouldn &apos;t deviate that much otherwise .
but that would mean that--
we have a mole .
there &apos;s a lot of new faces around here want to join the bau .
i don &apos;t think it &apos;s a federal agent .
i think it &apos;s someone in local law enforcement .
based on what ?
the clock .
according to al , the unsub left
5 minutes before we showed up .
that &apos;s a narrow window .
too narrow for him to wait around for an embolism ,
but he had to figure out a way to deal with his last victim .
montolo changed his m.o. at the last moment
because he learned about us at the last moment .
so the last one to hear the cavalry was coming in the judas .
that means a local cop .
or swat . you said wilson pulled his men off the scene ?
he said he wanted to box the unsub in .
but maybe he really wanted to ensure he got out .
we profiled that the unsub would have support and resources .
an ally in swat would give him both .
we go after a captain , we need more than a profile ,
we need proof .
the security perimeter they set up ,
they would have recorded every license plate . garcia .
yes , sir .
ok .
cross @-@ referencing last name wilson .
uh , ok . i got a ford taurus .
it is registered to betty wilson ,
wife of captain phil wilson .
quite a plan these 3 have .
all right , let her through .
he waved his own wife through the checkpoint .
and she secured the hit man &apos;s escape .
montolo has them both working under duress .
wilson has to be a customer .
which means he &apos;s also a target .
you ok ?
i think it &apos;s gonna be ok . i think he &apos;s gone .
what ?
where are we going ?
all right , let &apos;s get the job done .
jesus ...
fbi !
no ...
where &apos;s your husband ?
betty , where &apos;s phil ?
i don &apos;t know !
he left with ...
with the hit man he hired . we know everything .
no , you don &apos;t .
phil didn &apos;t hire him .
i did .
you ready ?
almost . setting up caller i.d. spoofing and ...
dialing .
ok , all you have to say is , &quot; it &apos;s me . can you talk ? &quot;
and i &apos;ll take it from there .
it &apos;s betty .
hey , babe .
it &apos;s me . can you talk ?
yeah .
not on speaker .
captain , this is aaron hotchner with the fbi .
we &apos;re going to get you out of this .
just drive normally and follow my prompts .
can you talk ? yes , it &apos;s fine , or not right now .
yeah , it &apos;s fine .
did you enter the address in the map apps on your phone ?
yeah , i took care of it .
we &apos;re getting the address from your phone , sir .
my team is going to beat you there .
you &apos;re gonna drive him straight to us .
no , i -- just let me run this errand
and then i can come home .
sir , you are the last errand .
he &apos;s going to kill you .
i gotta go , baby .
3 years ago , i had two miscarriages ,
back to back , just like that .
my o.b. prescribed painkillers ,
and after a while ...
you were taking them just to feel normal .
my ...
dealer wanted me to do things .
he wouldn &apos;t leave me alone .
that &apos;s when i read about silk road .
i could buy the drugs anonymously , and ...
and more than that .
so you hired montolo to kill the dealer .
did phil know about any of that ?
i kept it all a secret ,
until he showed up at our door .
then i didn &apos;t have a choice .
when i told phil ...
he said he still loved me .
god , i &apos;m so sorry .
you get all that ?
yeah . relay that to morgan and reid .
as soon as montolo lands , he &apos;s gonna kill wilson .
there &apos;ll be no time to intercept or talk him down .
it &apos;s a perfect place for a hit .
almost there .
hey , hey , calm down .
oh , dear . uh , captain wilson is calling us .
he &apos;s calling home , but -- i can try to fake it . i don &apos;t know ...
all right , everyone quiet .
stay off your phones . no one make a sound .
lewis , you &apos;re up .
h @-@ hello ?
hey , babe .
what is it ? is everything ok ?
yeah , i just --
sorry for snapping at you earlier .
hotch .
he just landed .
phil ?
just do what you need to do and get home , ok ?
i will .
sweetie , i can hear it in your voice . what is it ?
morgan , do you have a shot ?
do you have a visual ?
hotch , this is negative . wilson &apos;s in the way .
honey , talk to me , baby .
tell me where your head is at .
this whole thing , i never meant for any of this to happen .
i know . i &apos;m so , so sorry about all of it ,
but just keep your head down and we &apos;ll get through this .
ok ?
do you hear me , baby ?
just keep your head down .
go ! go !
drop the gun , captain .
no .
you &apos;re under arrest .
it was all me . betty had nothing to do with this .
we already know it was both of you , phil .
but you did what you did out of love .
and betty &apos;s only hope for leniency
is if you testify on her behalf .
