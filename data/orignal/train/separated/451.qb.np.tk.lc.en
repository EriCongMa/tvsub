dave rossi .
dave , i just finished the manuscript .
you are a crime novel artiste .
the butcher returns . the piano man sings .
the queen of diamonds is lady x. wow .
the new book is absolutely fantabulous , my friend .
it &apos;s compelling , captivating ...
but ...
it &apos;s incomplete . where is the dedication page ?
i didn &apos;t think you &apos;d notice .
i &apos;m paid to notice .
well , i haven &apos;t decided .
well , hurry , would you ? we &apos;re ready to go to print .
uh ... i &apos;ll get right on it .
today .
by the end of the week , amanda .
i &apos;ve still got my day job .
ah , yes . lives to save , adventures to live .
i get it !
you really don &apos;t .
someone is heating things up in santa monica
and they are not sharing the sunblock .
3 charred bodies have shown up at the pier in the last week .
m.e. cannot identify the victims .
she can tell us that two are male
and the latest victim is a female .
well , if he &apos;s crossing gender lines ,
we can probably rule out sexual assault .
was the coroner able to determine the exact cause of death ?
no . the results were inconclusive ,
but my money is on the obvious .
it might not be that simple .
if the unsub &apos;s connected to the victims ,
burning the bodies might be an attempt to mask their identity .
or he &apos;s sophisticated enough to know the fire will
eliminate the evidence of his murder rituals .
this takes time .
if he &apos;s burning his victims while they &apos;re alive ,
it &apos;s not just sadistic . he &apos;s patient .
and organized .
he &apos;d need access to materials necessary for burning a human body
and a space to do so undetected .
has anyone been reported missing ?
nobody that &apos;s a match .
i &apos;m running dental records in there right now , though .
then the problem is we &apos;re not even sure the victims are local .
that pier is a popular photo op .
he could be hunting tourists .
or warning them away .
he &apos;s dropping the bodies where they can be found quickly .
he &apos;s also accelerating his attacks .
he &apos;s gone from a 4 @-@ day cooling off period
to only two days between kills .
it &apos;s all part of his plan .
we need to stop him before he makes it one .
&quot; you never find yourself until you face the truth . &quot;
pearl bailey .
this guy &apos;s putting bodies on display
and staging their discovery to make an impact .
oh , he wants to be noticed ,
either for his handiwork
or because he lacks recognition in his everyday life .
he shows no signs of remorse for his crimes .
his message is more important than human life .
he might not even see these people as being human .
is it just me or does this feel territorial ?
i think you &apos;re right . for some reason ,
the pier is very important to him .
forget flossing those pearlies , my b.a.us ,
&apos;cause thanks to two fillings ,
an underage drinking charge ,
and a very effective m.a.d.d. organization ,
i have been able to identify the latest victim
of this person barbecuer as lindsay leeman ,
from edina , minnesota . she was only 19 years of age .
her file &apos;s on your tablets .
it says here she &apos;s only been in santa monica a couple months .
yeah , it doesn &apos;t look like she had a job ,
&apos;cause according to bank records ,
her mom &apos;s been sending her $ 250 a month .
ok , so how does she afford
an ocean avenue address on such little income ?
was she making money under the table ?
not that she was depositing , anyway .
cell phone records show her texting up until 7 : 00 last night .
this unsub &apos;s incredibly efficient .
he was able to abduct , murder , and dispose of lindsay &apos;s body
in under 12 hours .
wait , there &apos;s something else .
all her communications are to minnesota numbers .
there &apos;s not one from california .
so she lived somewhere two months
and didn &apos;t make any friends ?
i thought that only happened to me .
garcia , any luck identifying the other victims ?
no . apparently fire &apos;s my kryptonite .
but i &apos;ll keep searching .
so what &apos;s he trying to say ?
get out or this could be you ?
maybe .
it &apos;s a pretty public area . he &apos;s gotta be dumping late at night .
well , he blends in when he does .
santa monica police increased patrol
after the second body ,
yet he still manages to dump lindsay here .
this guy &apos;s getting smarter or he &apos;s got insider knowledge .
we should take a look at first responders .
you know , his rage might not be directed at tourists .
if the bodies are found and removed prior to morning rush hour ,
then most of them might not even have a chance to see his work .
then who would ?
hotchner .
sir , i noticed something odd .
there aren &apos;t any utilities listed in lindsay leeman &apos;s name ,
so i ran the address , and it turns out it is not a residence ,
it &apos;s a private mail center .
did her family know where she was staying ?
no , the apartment number lindsay gave her family
corresponds to the mailbox at the center .
her mom had no idea it wasn &apos;t a home .
all right , her mother &apos;s on the way to los angeles to claim the body .
yeah , she just got to lax .
i rerouted her to you .
ok . thanks .
there isn &apos;t much left .
were you able to determine if the victims died of immolation ?
an examination of the lungs indicates lindsay didn &apos;t breathe in smoke .
so she was dead before being set on fire .
same as the others .
so how is he killing them ?
i was able to isolate penetrating lacerations to the abdomen .
they were stabbed .
they most likely died of exsanguination as a result .
so the burning is nothing more than a forensic countermeasure .
an effective one . not only does it destroy trace evidence ,
but it makes it difficult to identify the bodies
and determine a common victimology .
hopefully lindsay &apos;s mother can fill in the gaps .
why did she lie about where she was living ?
that &apos;s what we &apos;re trying to figure out .
did lindsay know anyone in los angeles
before she moved here ?
no , she was on her own .
alone .
that &apos;s very brave .
she was fearless .
her dad died when she was young ,
so she learned to be independent earlier than most .
why did she leave home ?
she was chasing her dream .
so she was performing locally ?
all the time .
anywhere she could draw a crowd .
usually the pier .
did she mention meeting someone new ?
anyone who was offering her work ?
i was sending her money until she got settled .
if she needed more ...
where was my daughter living , agent hotchner ?
so lindsay &apos;s mother took out a second mortgage
so she could send cash to her here , but the problem is--
money doesn &apos;t go quite as far in california as it does in minnesota .
exactly . and lindsay must have known
that her mother would be worried about her ,
so she told her that she found an apartment
or order to relieve the financial stress .
you think she was living here ?
well , they don &apos;t charge any rent .
excuse me . we &apos;re looking for sarah mapes .
who &apos;s asking ?
i &apos;m aaron hotchner . this is dave rossi .
we &apos;re with the fbi .
what do you need , aaron ?
we &apos;re investigating homicides that have taken place
in the area in the last week .
they called the fbi in over a couple of burnt bodies ?
what happened ?
one of them a doctor ?
one of them was a 19 @-@ year @-@ old girl .
lindsay .
what can you tell us about her ?
she comes here now and then .
always singing for everybody .
made me promise to vote for her if she ever made it on tv .
you telling me she &apos;s dead ?
i &apos;m afraid so .
that &apos;s a damn shame .
i &apos;ll be right back .
always the young ones .
excuse me . sir ?
sergeant scott ?
lock it up , marines !
you got a death wish , marine ?
no , sergeant !
in that case , private rossi ,
you might want to put your helmet on
before the viet cong decide to paint your face red .
there &apos;s a war going on here , marines .
the sooner you start acting like it ,
the sooner you start making it to tomorrow .
and you , what &apos;s your name , marine ?
private first class hernandez !
well , private first class hernandez ,
seems like you landed in some sunny resort .
that &apos;s the only reason i can think
why you wouldn &apos;t be wearing your flak jacket !
sorry , sergeant !
sorry don &apos;t cut it out here , marines .
sorry get you dead .
and if you &apos;re dead ,
i have to carry your ass back here
so we can mail y &apos;all to your mama in a big wooden box .
now , do you think i want scoliosis ?
no , sergeant !
eyes front , marine .
sergeant .
take a good look , marines .
this is what war is .
you follow my orders , you just make it out of here alive .
there &apos;s no second chances out here .
we either win or we die .
understand ? !
yes , sergeant !
now fall out !
dave rossi .
it &apos;s been a while .
too long .
how did you know it was me ?
recognized you from your book cover .
you read my books ?
i thumbed through one or two .
i didn &apos;t know you were out here .
yeah , i figured i &apos;d get me some of those california girls .
and did you ?
once or twice .
but after my last divorce , i figured , uh ,
marriage just wasn &apos;t my thing .
yeah , tell me about it .
it &apos;s good seeing you .
i got to go .
no , no . let me give you my card .
i can &apos;t believe i ran into you like this .
look , we gotta get together . you could--
hey , man-- hey , whoa .
easy , buddy .
just want to see if you &apos;d like a portrait .
already got it started .
see ?
it looks just like you .
no .
if lindsay was a transient ,
it makes sense that the other victims could be , too .
this area of santa monica has a heavy homeless population .
that explains why garcia had trouble matching dental records .
regular office visits aren &apos;t a priority
for people who live on the streets .
he &apos;s been shaven clean and left exposed .
this is a complete change in m.o.
yeah , and look at his skin .
it looks like chemical burns .
it smells like bleach .
that &apos;s an evolution , but why ?
was the fire drawing too much attention ,
or does the chemical burn fulfill another purpose ?
he &apos;s got ligature marks on his wrists .
he couldn &apos;t fight back while the unsub burned him .
changed his dumping ground , too .
in sight of a homeless shelter ?
if he wasn &apos;t clear before , he certainly is now .
his face and prints are intact .
we should be able to i.d. him faster than the others .
maybe that &apos;s intentional .
his name &apos;s jeremy .
give me a second .
excuse me .
please .
you recognize him ?
he worked the boardwalk .
he was a artist .
you sure ?
thank you .
this helps .
look--
you don &apos;t have to say it .
it depends on what i was gonna say .
you were going to apologize for walking away yesterday . don &apos;t .
last time i saw you , you were unconscious ,
on your way home with a concussion
and a shrapnel wound in your arm .
i &apos;ve still got the scar .
what happened ?
you remember danny james ,
pfc from iowa , was 19 years old ?
you remember what they did to him over there ?
he was captured outside hue , i think .
they held him for 3 nights .
no eyes . no ears .
no arms .
but he was still alive .
you remember why they did that to him ?
hell , you were the first one to figure it out .
fear . they were trying to scare us .
same thing &apos;s happening here .
now , these people are here to help us .
they got work to do , so everybody listen up .
the guy we &apos;re looking for is hunting the homeless .
he seems to be most active at night .
we believe that this unknown subject , or unsub ,
is trying to make a social or a political statement
by targeting the homeless community .
he &apos;s evolved from obliterating his victims with fire
to wanting them to be identified
while still depersonalizing them .
listen , this guy &apos;s burning people with bleach .
he &apos;s trying to scare you .
and the shaving of the heads is most likely
another way he can humiliate his victims .
this unsub has a method of transportation
and the facilities to bleach and burn his victims .
he dumps the bodies prior to the morning commute ,
so he could have a day job .
you need to be hypervigilant to look after one another .
sleep in groups and in shifts .
how will we know it &apos;s him ?
you might not .
this guy blends in .
he &apos;s probably a local ,
someone who feels wronged by members of your community .
he does not draw attention to himself ,
and he &apos;s meticulous in his planning .
the fact that he &apos;s now dumping the bodies away from the pier
means he &apos;s probably aware of our investigation
and that this is far from over .
we need to increase the police presence on the street .
this guy is smart . we have to be smarter .
thanks for your help today .
we couldn &apos;t have reached out like this on our own .
these people trust you .
your training paid off .
thanks to you .
i did my job .
no , you did a lot more than that .
i was a screw @-@ up and you knew it .
well , maybe at first , but you showed potential .
fall back !
fall back !
fall back ! fall back now !
fall back , marines ! fall back !
take cover ! that &apos;s an order ! fall back !
fall back !
hernandez !
take cover , rossi ! pull back ! that &apos;s an order !
but what about hernandez ?
leave no man behind , sergeant !
pull back ! that &apos;s an order !
rossi , you cover this position and cover hernandez !
i don &apos;t know if i can , sergeant !
you can and you will .
where are you going ? ! wait !
sergeant ! sergeant !
look , we &apos;re staying just a few blocks from here .
why don &apos;t you come back with me ?
i can get you a room .
this is my home , david .
this is no way for a war hero to live .
you know how many veterans are on the street ?
too many .
more every day .
it &apos;s not glamorous , but ... it &apos;s me .
no , it &apos;s not .
you think after 40 years ,
you know a damn thing about me ?
how long have you lived like this ?
i worked construction for a while ,
but no one wants an old man on the job
when they can get somebody younger and cheaper .
how long ?
a year .
maybe 5 .
it &apos;s hard to keep track without a watch .
then let me help you .
if i had wanted your help ,
i would have asked for it .
could the fire have destroyed evidence of
bleach on the previous victims ?
chemical residue would have turned up in the autopsies .
so we were right .
he changed m.o. to perfect his message .
he changed something else , too .
i found bleach in jeremy &apos;s lungs .
the unsub drowned him .
the first victims were incinerated postmortem .
why torture now ?
he &apos;s starting to enjoy the kills .
so as he fine @-@ tunes his methodology ,
he &apos;s also fine @-@ tuning what gets him off .
well , he managed to bleach jeremy inside and out .
this could be about cleanliness .
or cleansing .
the socioeconomic kind .
he &apos;s trying to eradicate the homeless .
need a blanket ?
thanks , i &apos;ve got one that &apos;s all right .
if you want to ,
check with some of the younger kids first .
already taken care of . why don &apos;t you come with me ?
i can give you a shower and a warm bed .
i &apos;m not a prostitute .
i didn &apos;t say you were .
i just thought i could help you with your problem .
and what is my problem ?
your disease .
don &apos;t have a disease .
no , i don &apos;t !
yes , you do .
i &apos;m going to rid you of it once and for all .
leave her alone !
no ! let me go ! help !
did you find her ?
not yet .
i had that son of a bitch right in my hands ,
i let him get away !
a few less drinks might have helped .
what the hell are you talking about ?
i think saying age put you on the streets is a copout .
don &apos;t you lecture me , rossi .
what did booze cost you first ?
your home ? your job ? or maybe one of your wives .
this wasn &apos;t my fault !
i &apos;m not saying that it was .
i tried to save sarah ! i couldn &apos;t !
so now you &apos;re giving up .
there &apos;s nothing else i can do .
yes , there is .
help me to help her .
now , i want you to relax
and focus .
what &apos;s the point of this ?
i told you .
it &apos;s a cognitive interview .
many times our subconscious picks up on details
our conscious mind &apos;s not aware of .
a marine more so .
it &apos;s been a long time since i was active , dave .
the instinct never goes away .
now , close your eyes .
oh , yes , sir .
take yourself back to that night .
put yourself in the alley .
it &apos;s dark .
you &apos;re getting ready for bed .
something caught your attention .
what is it ?
and what is my problem ?
sarah &apos;s voice .
all right . but you must have heard her voice a hundred times .
what made it stick out ?
don &apos;t have a disease .
she &apos;s afraid .
can you see why ?
all right , what else stuck out ?
any distinctive odors ?
i &apos;m not sure .
it smells like a hospital .
whatever it is , it &apos;s out of place .
focus on that smell .
let it draw you into the conversation .
... blanket ?
thanks , i &apos;ve got one that &apos;s all right .
if you want to , check with some of the younger kids .
i see him .
describe him to me .
why don &apos;t you come with me ?
i--i can &apos;t make him out .
he &apos;s standing in the shadows .
blue collar ? clean @-@ cut ?
jeans and a button @-@ down shirt .
can you see his face ?
it &apos;s too dark .
ok , let &apos;s go back to the clothes .
we follow them down to his hands .
is he wearing a wedding ring ?
he &apos;s wearing gloves .
medical gloves ? work gloves ?
driving gloves .
are there any other distinctive smells ?
did he leave his car running ?
gasoline .
older model ford .
yeah , the engine is still running .
it &apos;s a mustang , i think .
can you see the license plate ?
i &apos;m lying on the ground .
he &apos;s--he &apos;s taking her to the car !
he &apos;s coming right at me !
the plate is right in front of you ! tell me what it says .
i can &apos;t see it .
yes , you can . you can do this .
&quot; j &quot; !
yeah , go ahead .
&quot; w &quot; !
go on ! go on !
&quot; d &quot; !
that &apos;s all i got .
rossi ...
you gotta find her .
i can &apos;t lose another one .
another one ?
try and get some rest .
factoring in a 2 @-@ mile comfort zone
mixed with mustang registries and a jwd partial ,
i come up with squat .
he probably stole the plates , garcia .
run mustang registries from that area
and focus on the ones manufactured prior to the 1980s .
uh , i &apos;ve got 10 possibilities .
well , i doubt this guy could maintain a steady relationship .
eliminate any vehicles registered to women .
only knocks off 2 . we got 8 more to go , folks .
all right , what are their occupations ?
uh , ad exec ,
a teacher , a waiter ...
whoa , i got a firefighter .
well , that would definitely
explain this guy &apos;s proficiency at burning .
and he would know the layout
of the street cameras to avoid detection .
garcia , does this firefighter
have any relationship to the homeless community ?
let &apos;s see ...
chad mills--third generation firefighter .
he saved 6 homeless people from an electrical fire
that destroyed the warehouse they were squatting in .
9 others died in the blaze .
that &apos;s not a coincidence .
why didn &apos;t he come up in the search of first responders .
because he isn &apos;t one anymore .
he left the department two months ago .
just before the murders started .
garcia--
sending you his address now .
clear !
he was just here .
i need medical .
i &apos;m going around back .
he couldn &apos;t have gotten far .
let &apos;s go .
try not to talk , sarah .
help &apos;s on the way .
this will coat your throat and help dilute the bleach .
get in !
what &apos;s the status on mills ?
mills is missing . we don &apos;t have him .
i repeat , mills is gone .
you ruined everything .
come on .
i should have seen this coming .
rossi , you couldn &apos;t have known he &apos;d circle back for scott .
what you need ?
garcia , give us everything
you have on chad mills .
no dust .
nothing out of sorts .
his clothes are organized by color .
you know , this speaks to clear signs of ocd behavior .
sarah had some sort of gel in her hair .
i want to try to find the source .
what is it ?
quell , a medical @-@ grade disinfectant .
his ocd may manifest in extreme germaphobia .
that must be why he shaved jeremy &apos;s head .
there wasn &apos;t any sign of disinfectant until today , though .
but it might have been eliminated by the bleach and the fire .
guys , fire , bleach , quell--
these are all forms of sterilization .
so you think the burning might be incidental ?
if he &apos;s socioeconomically cleansing the streets ,
he could be treating the homeless population like an infection .
to him they &apos;re a virus .
and he &apos;s the cure .
i figured out why mills left the fire department .
he was forced out because he contracted
a drug @-@ resistant strain of tuberculosis .
how did he get it , you ask ?
two of the squatters he saved
from that burning warehouse were infected .
theory is he caught it through close , unprotected contact .
that &apos;s a hell of a trigger .
he blames the homeless community for getting him sick .
combine that trauma with an ocd germaphobe
and what do you get ?
a serial killer
who thinks he can stop the spread of tb
by killing an entire population .
the same way the victims of the plague were burned .
well , now he &apos;s on the run and he can &apos;t go back home ,
so where would he take scott ?
back to where his trauma originated .
garcia , give us the address of the warehouse fire .
careful . you gonna get me wet .
i &apos;m gonna burn you alive .
that &apos;s a first for me .
don &apos;t go out of your way on my account .
you ruined my mission .
your mission ?
you fighting the wrong war , son .
i am not your son !
that the best you got ?
what &apos;s the matter ? you sick ?
you should recognize the signs .
it was your kind who did this to me .
my kind ?
yeah .
i was going to matter .
you still can , chad .
come any closer and i burn him .
you don &apos;t want to do that .
and you don &apos;t want to shoot .
otherwise we &apos;ll both go up .
that &apos;s pretty brave what you did ,
running into that fire on your own .
yeah ? look how that turned out .
i don &apos;t know , if you ask me ,
i say it was pretty stupid .
stupid ?
yeah , that &apos;s right .
you went in without protective gear .
looks like maybe you were trying to prove something .
third @-@ generation fireman . what &apos;s there to prove ?
it &apos;s in his genes .
quite a legacy to try to live up to .
but you just wanted to be the best , didn &apos;t you ?
i am the best !
guess we &apos;ll never know for sure .
my whole life ,
i knew i was gonna be a fireman .
that i would matter !
you do matter , chad . everyone matters .
not him ! he doesn &apos;t .
that man is a marine .
he risked his life to protect us .
you telling me that doesn &apos;t matter ?
he &apos;s right , dave .
what ?
he drops that lighter ,
this whole place goes up in flames .
i don &apos;t want you all caught in the crossfire because of me .
it &apos;s time to fall back .
i &apos;m not leaving you behind .
that &apos;s an order , marine !
ok , we &apos;re falling back .
what you gonna do now ?
guess it &apos;s time to finish this .
you &apos;re not getting out of this place alive .
i didn &apos;t say i was .
do i get any last words ?
no one wants to hear them
&apos;cause no one cares if you die .
that &apos;s where you &apos;re wrong .
what are you doing ? i &apos;m gonna burn this place down !
don &apos;t do it !
thank you .
so , that was quite a stunt you pulled in there .
i knew you &apos;d get the message .
figured that was my best chance not to go down with him .
so you bet your life on the bau .
i bet my life on you .
do you know why i joined the fbi ?
if you say--
because of you .
you could say the corps changed me ,
or the war .
but it was you who made me honest .
so , please , be honest with me now .
what are you running from ?
you remember how you got that scar in the first place ?
of course i do .
perez , cover our right flank .
hernandez , our left .
mattheson , i need you on point .
damn .
everyone , stand back !
how bad , sergeant ?
hernandez ,
i need you to take the troops back to our last position .
sergeant ?
any movement and this whole field lights up .
now move the men back .
yes , sergeant .
you better go , too , sergeant .
can &apos;t do that , son .
leave no one behind .
don &apos;t die &apos; cause if screwed up .
who said anything about dying ?
we &apos;re at the end of the chain .
we can use that ditch for cover .
we &apos;ll never make it .
on my count .
3 ...
2 ...
1 !
that blast gave you a concussion .
when you regained consciousness ,
you were already on your way home .
next thing i knew , i was in the hospital
getting ready to rotate home .
and i was receiving a commendation for heroic bravery .
and you deserved it .
not a lot of people would have done that .
no .
but someone did more .
hernandez ,
i need you to take the troops back to our last position .
sergeant ?
any movement and this whole field lights up .
now move the men back .
yes , sergeant .
hernandez , what are you doing ?
push &apos; em through . i got work to do .
we &apos;ll never make it .
on my count .
3 ...
2 ...
1 !
hernandez ?
but why ?
why did he do it ?
or why did i take credit ?
both .
the short answer is ...
i was ordered to .
we were fighting that p.r. war back home .
the government needed a face ,
a living face , to parade around ,
to solicit support for a unpopular war .
i was chosen .
and hernandez ?
he was paying a debt .
he was being a marine .
he died so that we could live .
and you couldn &apos;t tell anyone .
come with me .
where ?
to honor our dead .
&quot; i am not concerned that you have fallen .
i am concerned that you will rise . &quot;
