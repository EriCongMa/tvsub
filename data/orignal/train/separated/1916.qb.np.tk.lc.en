&quot; get up , stand up &quot;
failure is an inevitability .
dr. cristina yang .
thank you , dr. hunt .
the , uh ...
the procedure i-- is so relatively untried
that
the associated risks are un @-@ unusually high .
still , that shouldn &apos;t be a reason not to try .
every scientist was told &quot; no , &quot;
over and over .
you okay ?
yeah .
fortunately , the patient is responding very well for now .
his vitals remain stable , and it is our hope
that this will continue . and if it does ,
i am cautiously optimistic
that we can call this procedure a success--
uh ... &quot; home run &quot; is a better word .
dr. yang hit a home run .
thanks to her , baby nathan is thriving this morning .
the ones we remember .
the ones who changed our lives .
the curies , the salks ...
the barnards ...
we &apos;ll print another portal vein .
we &apos;ll perform tests on that ,
and look for material that will hold up better .
so we go back to the drawing board ?
they &apos;re the ones who wouldn &apos;t take &quot; no &quot; for an answer .
yes , ma &apos;am .
morning .
is that your name i see on the o.r. board this afternoon ?
well , it &apos;s just a cholie . getting my feet wet .
you &apos;re gonna miss kepner &apos;s wedding ?
well , i scheduled my first surgery
when everyone will be gone .
i @-@ i didn &apos;t want to make a big fuss .
you got a tumor debulking .
you gonna be done in time ?
i will be done on time .
all right .
you &apos;re operating , too , huh ?
the medication &apos;s helping ?
mm .
i &apos;m proud of you , bailey .
i don &apos;t want to make a big fuss .
i thought that went pretty well .
you &apos;re off my service .
and you &apos;ve got to be over your hours .
you should go home and take a day off .
what ? !
what for ?
you don &apos;t know when to keep your mouth shut .
they needed to hear it was an extraordinary--
i am not comfortable with you speaking for me ,
especially about this case .
ross actually said what needed to be said .
and you were not comfortable at all .
you were tanking in there .
i &apos;m only at 68 hours for the week . see ?
&quot; j.a.m.a. &quot; wants a interview . it should be short .
conference room &quot; c. &quot;
i &apos;m worried about you .
you &apos;ve been going too fast lately .
and i &apos;m not the only one who noticed .
who ?
it doesn &apos;t matter who .
have i screwed up ?
is my work not up to--
no .
your work is--is great .
it &apos;s just , you &apos;re becoming ...
you &apos;re going to burn yourself out .
i think i know what this is .
you just need to work off some tension .
we &apos;re not doing that anymore .
if you &apos;re worried i think it &apos;s more than it is , i don &apos;t .
it &apos;s just to relax you .
it &apos;s you who needs to relax .
i &apos;m fine .
i &apos;m sorry .
don &apos;t shut me out .
i &apos;m fine .
ross , go home .
okay , so first we determine the receptive field
of all the sensors , right ? okay .
yeah .
derek , the guys from kleiss neuroscience will be here in 20 .
oh , i can &apos;t . i-- once i &apos;m done here ,
i have to get bailey to a music class .
um , what &apos;s this ?
they want to talk to me about a research thing .
it &apos;s not just a &quot; thing . &quot;
it is the presidential initiative on brain mapping .
it is the thing .
okay . no .
we &apos;re starting phase two .
okay ? he &apos;s my brain now .
meredith can have the rest . i get his brain .
i &apos;ll get rid of them .
no , you won &apos;t .
you will say &quot; yes &quot; to them .
and you &apos;re both gonna be at kepner &apos;s wedding , yes ?
mm @-@ hmm .
uh @-@ huh .
i &apos;m not going .
bailey &apos;s doing surgery , finally .
and i &apos;d rather do that than watch arizona
stand up there looking gorgeous
while i &apos;m some pathetic , shriveled , leftover ,
discarded thing she scraped off her shoe .
ew ! no , don &apos;t do that .
no ! i know you think this is just what i do .
oh , hey , hey ! you &apos;re all going to the wedding , right ?
yes .
is it mandatory ?
this is exactly--
exactly what you do .
i know what i do , and this is not that .
she was important .
we were something .
maybe they was something .
nah .
no .
how &apos;s your dad ?
he &apos;s told all the nurses you &apos;re his kid .
he &apos;s proud . how is he ?
don &apos;t know . don &apos;t really care .
help ! you gotta help my boy ! he &apos;s been run over !
sir , do not move ! don &apos;t move him !
no , no , no , no .
stop ! stop ! the gurney !
keep him still .
backboard and c @-@ spine !
he was driving the tractor .
he hit a bump and fell off .
he went under the wheel and the chaser bin , too .
has he moved at all since ?
yeah , yeah , he was trying to get up .
okay , let &apos;s get him straight to the lodox .
all right , let &apos;s go !
what &apos;s his name ?
cody . his name &apos;s cody .
cody , i &apos;m dr. robbins . can you hear me ?
you didn &apos;t call an ambulance ?
i called 9 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 . but then he passed out ,
and i was so scared , i couldn &apos;t wait .
so i @-@ i brought him here myself .
you say he was moving before ?
yeah . that &apos;s good , right ?
sir , i &apos;m gonna need you to step back .
we &apos;re going to do everything we can .
uh , excuse me , grey ?
uh , the press would like some photos of the printer .
is this a good time ?
oh , sure . where do you want us ?
oh , well , it &apos;s actually--
it &apos;s for the nathan glazier case . so ..
but it &apos;s printing my work .
yeah , that &apos;s fine . i mean , no one would know .
we can come back .
okay , right by the printer .
oh , dr. yang , that &apos;s perfect .
it &apos;s a burst fracture at c @-@ 6
page torres . his belly &apos;s full of blood .
he &apos;s going to the o.r. now .
he should &apos;ve waited for the ambulance .
i think this guy paralyzed his own kid
by bringing him here himself .
we don &apos;t know that yet , alex .
i got this . why don &apos;t you go be with your dad ?
that &apos;s all right .
what ? you must have questions .
long @-@ lost father ? i mean , i &apos;d have a billion .
help me get him to the o.r. ,
and then i &apos;ll call you if i need you , okay ? let &apos;s go .
is he gonna be okay ?
he has a lot of internal bleeding ,
so we need to operate right away .
also , his neck is broken .
oh , my god .
he can move , right ?
he was moving .
that was before he was mov--
we &apos;ll know more in a bit .
we &apos;re doing everything that we can .
so sit tight .
wow , you look ...
nope ! no .
don &apos;t say i look nice .
like a train wreck .
but i can see where it &apos;s going .
um , what are you doing here ?
i &apos;m hunting bridesmaids .
now is that a farm tradition ?
are you gonna be there ?
all right . i totally understand if you &apos;re not .
i just--
do you want me to be there ?
yes ! of course .
then i &apos;ll be there .
thank you .
all right .
okay . oh , wait . you know what ?
oh , watch it .
the hair is ...
yeah .
elliot hooks , 20,
here for repeat debulking of bronchial tumors .
this will be his ...
wait , that can &apos;t be right .
it &apos;s right .
312 surgeries .
i started treatments when i was 4 .
his growths recur ,
build up and threaten his larynx and lungs .
we have to laser them out .
every seven to ten days .
312 ?
that &apos;s ... rough .
i &apos;m used to it .
my folks bought a house a few blocks away .
kinda the way you move close to the good school .
no , we &apos;re not doing this .
sorry .
elliot ...
what if i can culture your tumor cells in a lab
and custom design a drug that can stop the growth ,
find exactly the medicine to stop them ?
and ... no surgery ?
no surgeries , ever again .
oh , my god .
right ?
oh , my god .
you don &apos;t think this young man &apos;s had enough surgery ?
yes , ma &apos;am . i &apos;m sorry .
damn right , you &apos;re sorry . now let &apos;s go open up my lab .
no !
i haven &apos;t had enough surgery .
i have waited and waited for you to get back in the o.r. ,
and damn it , enough is enough .
i &apos;m here to study surgery , and i &apos;m being left behind .
and i deserve better than this .
so i ...
i &apos;m just tired .
let &apos;s go .
we need to do elliot &apos;s procedure once more ,
to get the samples i need .
and you will perform it , beginning to end .
prep the man .
thank you .
eh , watch yourself in there .
his breath in incredibly nasty .
it &apos;s fine .
it &apos;s not .
it &apos;s--it &apos;s rank .
i can smell what he ate last tuesday .
that is zenker &apos;s diverticulum .
now these muscles here should be working together
to push food down the esophagus .
but unfortunately , dalton &apos;s are working against each other .
so the wall forms a sack ,
and that &apos;s where the food &apos;s getting caught .
i always feel like i have something caught in my throat .
he got pneumonia once from getting food in his lungs .
he &apos;s a mess .
i &apos;m a mess .
well , i &apos;ll be cutting into the lower muscle ,
so that &apos;ll allow the food to pass right through .
and the walls will tighten up on their own .
anything we should worry about ?
well , of course , with all surgeries ...
there are certain risks --
worst case being stroke or even death .
but these are all very minimal in this case .
there is a small risk of damage ...
to the vocal chord nerves , though .
what , like ...
i won &apos;t be able to talk ?
that &apos;s the worst case .
it &apos;s very unlikely .
you have a cute butt .
dalton !
you heard the man . i might not speak again .
and i don &apos;t want to leave anything unsaid .
you have a sweet caboose .
also , i never liked your brother .
what ? !
i also could have kept that one to myself .
but it felt good to say it .
you &apos;re an idiot . how soon can you put him under ?
yeah , there you are .
yeah , she is the magical healer of children .
but you &apos;re done now , right ? you &apos;re done ? can we go ?
can we get one more ?
please come with me .
why are you here ?
are you bailing on the wedding ?
what ?
no ! i &apos;m not bail -- why would you say that ?
no , i need you . come with me .
gentlemen , as you know , the president himself
has issued a mandate for our community ...
to devise a full and complete map of the human brain .
kleiss neuroscience wants to lead
the pack towards that goal .
we &apos;ve got a huge n.i.h. grant to do it with .
the first steps will be developing the technology .
the sensors you develop for your b.c.i. work
are the most responsive we &apos;ve seen .
i &apos;m flattered . thank you .
wait till you see what we &apos;re doing .
i &apos;m afraid that dr. torres and my b.c.i. work
is all @-@ consuming . i @-@ i don &apos;t have the time .
this will be the , uh , compensation that you &apos;ll receive
just for consulting long @-@ distance .
okay , see , i &apos;m not even gonna turn that over .
it &apos;s not about the compensation .
turn over the paper .
i don &apos;t want to .
just ... turn it over .
it &apos;s not about the money .
it &apos;s a lot of money .
i don &apos;t care how much money it is .
it &apos;s not about that .
will you at least watch our movie ?
yes . yes , he will .
just listen to what they have to say .
absolutely .
kleiss neuroscience ...
mapping the way to tomorrow .
okay , okay .
you just -- - you wanna watch the movie ? here we go .
once more . up .
ugh ! i &apos;m too tired .
sorry , darlin &apos; .
could you , uh , give us a sec ?
i got a question .
i recognized you the first time i saw you .
how do you forget a wife and three kids ?
how -- how do you do that ?
i made such a mess of everything .
the more time went by , the more drugs i did ,
the more i let myself forget
&apos;cause i couldn &apos;t stand myself . you know ?
i remember you , though .
i remember you used to laugh in your sleep .
well , that &apos;s when i was , like , 4 , right ?
you were just a happy kid .
i guess i fixed that , huh ?
yeah , i remember you took me to the fair once .
it &apos;s , uh , one of those travelling ones
where all the rides are crappy and you might die .
but , uh , we rode every ride twice .
it was a good night .
i remember that .
your mom was having a meltdown .
she was tearing the wallpaper of the walls ,
saying someone was hiding in there .
that woman was such a damn mess --
what about this other family ?
i mean , how &apos;d you leave it with them ?
better .
i could maybe try and go back .
naomi &apos;s tough , but she &apos;s not your mother .
she &apos;s not bug @-@ eyed crazy .
all right , this has got to stop now .
mom was not the problem .
i &apos;m not trying to bad @-@ talk your mother ,
but you can &apos;t know what a strain it is
being with someone like that .
who do you think took care of her ?
kept track of her ?
got her committed so she wouldn &apos;t hurt herself ?
who do you think took care of your kids ? !
i did the best i could .
oh , well , if that &apos;s your best than you should just hang it up !
your best is worthless !
i was the dad !
i was a kid , but i was the dad !
you were nothing !
you ... were gone !
you &apos;re worthless !
okay ! okay , okay .
walk away .
okay , i can fuse c @-@ 5 and 6 , but i have to work fast
if we even want a shot at avoiding paralysis .
oh , thank you . you &apos;re a genius . 10 blade .
i am , actually , well , sort of a genius .
derek and i start phase two today --
tactile pressure feedback .
awesome ! good for you .
well , it &apos;s good for you , too .
the goal is a prosthetic leg , uh ,
as sensitive and as responsive as the one that you lost .
get you back to where you were .
okay , um , prep the neck . i &apos;m gonna scrub .
hey , i told you i &apos;d call you if i need you .
how &apos;s your dad ?
where do you want me ?
grab a clamp .
help me find the bleeders .
meredith !
april , what are you doing ?
oh , god . are you making a break for it ?
don &apos;t worry . i know what to do .
really ?
why does everybody think i &apos;m running ?
i &apos;m not running . come with me .
but i ...
no .
you bailed on every single one of your fittings
for your bridesmaid &apos;s dress , so ...
i brought the seamstress to you .
you will look pretty for my wedding .
hello . no clothes , please .
you guys are supposed to be doing this stuff for me .
i saw your , uh , press conference .
what happened to you up there ?
i was supposed to tell them what i did ,
but i &apos;m not totally sure .
what do you mean ?
i &apos;m not sure why the kid is still alive .
the conduit ? you thought it would fail ?
it did fail . we adjusted ,
but i don &apos;t know what i did , mer .
it &apos;s like slapping the side of a tv .
i fixed it , but i &apos;m not sure how .
i feel like a complete fraud .
so you just went ahead anyway ?
i mean , you didn &apos;t mention that to anyone ?
well ... to who , mer ? you weren &apos;t talking to me ,
alex was against me .
i had no one . i had no choice .
it was his best shot .
wow . you were right .
we are in two completely different places .
mer , please .
no , i mean , i ... i may overreach ,
and i may have something to prove , but ...
i will never be as arrogant as you are .
you know what , meredith ?
go to hell .
i have listened to your crap for weeks now ,
and i &apos;m not gonna stand here and take it anymore .
you stand here .
and that &apos;s why at kleiss neuroscience
tomorrow is today .
well ?
very impressive .
like i said , i &apos;m overextended .
derek , they &apos;re just asking for a consult .
this is not a relocation , right ?
no , no , no .
just , it &apos;d be a couple of visits every couple of months .
once again , i &apos;m flattered , but i @-@ i--
i just don &apos;t have the time .
just guide us in what we &apos;re doing .
no .
not if this is what you &apos;re doing .
wait , you think that there &apos;s something wrong
with--with our approach .
our method is the bleeding edge of--
your method couldn &apos;t map the human sphincter .
derek .
i &apos;m sorry , but they ... they ...
they made me .
you &apos;re looking at a planet .
i &apos;m saying step back ...
and look at the universe .
you don &apos;t kiss someone by puckering your lips .
you see someone and you remember why you desire them .
your sympathetic nervous system quickens your pulse ,
your frontal lobe lowers your inhibitions ,
and you need to kiss them .
it happens all at once .
we &apos;re impulsive and compulsive .
that &apos;s how the brain works .
stop looking at what we do .
look at why we do it .
is he saying change the sensor placement ?
no , you don &apos;t get it , tim .
i want to .
he &apos;s saying change everything .
he is saying ...
where are you ...
this diffuser / tensor imaging is old news .
shh . shh .
he &apos;s saying that cortical firing will give us ...
they &apos;re starting to get it .
deeper cuts and faster pictures of the whole brain .
oh , you know that dress ...
the purple one with the stripes ?
yeah .
it does make you look fat .
what ? !
you said it was pretty .
i lied .
but i want my last words to be honest ones .
you are gorgeous . but in that dress ...
bastard .
you look like a parade float .
i wore that dress to three weddings .
* it had to be you *
it &apos;s our song . last chance , hon .
* it had to be you *
guys , the risk of damage to your vocal chords is so minimal .
cut them . cut the chords , please .
uh , this is your last stop , karen .
hey . come here .
i &apos;ll see you after .
move it more laterally .
there .
got it .
i owe you an apology .
i shouldn &apos;t have spoken to you that way .
why ? you got what you wanted .
and you were right .
part of my job is to teach you .
i haven &apos;t been doing that .
i wasn &apos;t sure if i was being rewarded or punished .
part of my mystique .
oh , get that one .
never be afraid to stand up for yourself .
just be sure you &apos;re right when you do .
that &apos;s so true .
i have to stand up for what i deserve .
that is so incredibly true .
i know , i said it . eh , you missed that one .
you tell me how you can give
100 % to your family and 100 % to your job .
uh , it ... it &apos;s categorically impossible ...
because you keep screwing with my research .
oh , god , mer .
my borrowing your printer had nothing
to do with your dead sheep .
did you ever think maybe your research
is failing all on it &apos;s own ?
right , because i &apos;m a terrible doctor .
we &apos;ve established that .
no , i never said that .
you said that--
i never said that !
but you said i was a terrible person ...
over and over ...
because i don &apos;t agree with you .
because i &apos;m committed to my work .
because i don &apos;t want a baby ?
when did i become such a monster to you ?
can i talk to you ?
ugh . shane , go away .
i thought they should hear what you did , and you downplayed it .
shane , i said get out ! go home !
and i was right .
what ?
an e @-@ mail from the harper avery foundation
requesting a case study and patient status .
what ?
you &apos;re in consideration for this year &apos;s award .
now you take off , and you take off .
are you gonna wear your high @-@ heel leg ?
&apos;cause it looks amazing . but you always get so sore
after a while . oh , also , it &apos;s on a farm ,
so it might be muddy . you--
i &apos;ll be fine .
okay .
were you able to decompress the cord ?
is he paralyzed ?
uh , it &apos;s too soon to tell .
you gonna tell the dad ?
tell the dad what ?
the spinal injury was likely caused
by the father transporting him .
oh , god . you wait for an ambulance .
well , he didn &apos;t know .
yeah , well , and now maybe his kid might not walk ?
i mean , he would have been better off if he had just
kept his hands off .
callie , stop it .
his kid was hurt , and he was trying to fix it .
sometimes we try to make things better
and we have no idea that we &apos;re actually causing more pain .
of course we don &apos;t tell him .
no .
i cant get in there to staple .
there &apos;s too many strictures .
all right . i &apos;m gonna go in through his neck .
okay .
there you go .
what do you think he said to her ?
no idea .
though , i don &apos;t think there &apos;s much
they wouldn &apos;t say to each other .
right ? how do you get to that point ?
there &apos;s nothing i wouldn &apos;t say to you .
oh , i doubt that .
we are nowhere near that point .
you shed .
you shed hair . you shed bras .
that is untrue and unkind .
you stay over my place for the weekend ,
and there &apos;s hair all over every pillow ,
and a bra on every door knob .
you got a bra in my silverware drawer .
oh , which one ? was it blue ?
how do you have so many bras ?
well , you have angry face .
i have angry face ?
yeah , when you are thinking or solving a problem
or just counting change ,
people think you &apos;re pissed off .
well , i &apos;m not pissed off .
well , i know . it &apos;s just your face .
i &apos;m getting pissed off .
then you should smile more .
you have a beautiful smile .
i think he said he loved her .
maybe .
say it loud and go from there .
what ?
no , it &apos;s something mark sloan said to me once .
he &apos;s ready , doctors .
he said , uh , &quot; if you love somebody ,
you tell &apos; em , even if you &apos;re scared
it &apos;ll cause problems
or burn your life to the ground .
say it loud and go from there . &quot; that &apos;s nice .
aah ! oh , my god !
what are you doing here ? !
i &apos;m working .
on our wedding day ?
i have to earn enough to take time off after our wedding day .
you saw me .
barely .
i @-@ i didn &apos;t see your dress . i didn &apos;t see your hair .
do you have a really big hat on ?
this is such bad luck !
such bad luck !
no , no , no , no , no .
it &apos;s good . it &apos;s good , &apos; cause ...
if the first time i saw you today
was in the dress with the hair , looking that beautiful ,
i would just be reminded of how much i don &apos;t deserve you ,
and i &apos;d probably pass out .
and we &apos;d wind up back here .
we wouldn &apos;t be married .
they &apos;d have to cut off my suit ,
and i &apos;m still paying for it .
i &apos;m glad i saw you like this ,
&apos;cause i &apos;m gonna see you like this a lot more
than i &apos;ll see you like that for the rest of our lives .
and i love you like this .
i love you , too .
i can &apos;t wait .
oh ! hey , don &apos;t forget black socks .
matthew ?
matthew ?
it &apos;s possible the lack of nerve response is due
to , uh , trauma and swelling to the spinal cord .
it could recede with time .
an @-@ and if it doesn &apos;t ?
we &apos;re looking at paralysis ,
likely quadriplegia .
we &apos;ll have to wait and see .
it &apos;s my fault , isn &apos;t it ?
he was moving when it happened .
then i brought him here .
i did this .
i did this to him .
you were trying to help him .
whatever happens , it &apos;s not your fault .
look , you were just trying to do your best for your kid .
okay ?
well , unfortunately , i wasn &apos;t able to access the diverticulum
with the scope , so we went in surgically .
but it went seamlessly ...
and he is gonna have very fresh breath .
thank you .
he &apos;s waking up .
all right .
hi , honey .
w @-@ what &apos;s wrong with him ?
page shepherd right away . dalton ?
excuse me .
dalton ?
i can compete as a mother and as a surgeon .
you just don &apos;t think i can compete against you .
you can &apos;t , because , mer , this is all i do .
this is all i want to do .
so don &apos;t whine to me because you made a decision you regret now .
you think i regret my family ? !
i think you feel left behind . and that sucks for you ,
but no one forced you out of the game .
i am not out of the game !
i just won &apos;t sabotage my friends to win it !
oh . oh , is that what i did ?
that &apos;s what sharks do .
you called it our first day .
well , as i recall , i was talking about you .
how long have you been sleeping with shane ?
you blashes at an exposed ankle .
he saw you in your underwear at and didn &apos;t bat an eye .
that is none of your business !
you don &apos;t have to justify it to me .
he &apos;s just hooking up with the best teacher
to make sure he can everything he can .
it &apos;s what you did all through med school
and all through intern year .
congratulations .
you &apos;ve become the thing you worship .
and you became the thing we laughed at .
hey .
i &apos;m sorry . i--
you don &apos;t have to be sorry .
i mean , it &apos;s like you said .
you did your best , and ...
i turned out all right , so ...
thanks .
i just want my family again .
we &apos;re not family .
all right , i turned out all right because you left .
aaron and amber and mom--
they &apos;re okay now because you left .
if you &apos;d stayed , i &apos;d probably be selling beer or something .
or maybe i would &apos;ve followed in your footsteps
and o.d. by now .
but you left us , thank god .
so you can stop beating yourself up .
maybe you can fix it with your kid in florida .
good luck with that .
bye , jimmy .
he had a massive stroke .
it could &apos;ve dislodged a blood clot in the carotid
during the surgery .
it &apos;s a rare outcome for any surgery , but it does happen .
we will pursue every avenue for rehabilitation ,
but i &apos;m afraid that--
you can &apos;t fix it ?

and i deserve her .
i am not gonna be thrown aside .
i am going to that wedding ,
and i am going to stand up in front of everyone ,
and i &apos;m gonna tell arizona how i feel ,
and she &apos;s gonna be forced to deal with it .
and i sound crazy .
and this is the thing-- the thing that i do !
yeah , it is !
thank you ! thank you for not letting me do that .

the--the kleiss guys ?
it wasn &apos;t enough just to turn them down ?
you had to tear down everything that they &apos;re doing ?
do you think i don &apos;t want to help them ? it &apos;s bad timing .
and you need me to keep my focus here ...
i know . i do , but--
to turn this place into an innovation hub .
it is a call to serve , derek .
it is a presidential initiative .
the president asks you to serve ? you serve .
you do what is asked of you .
well , your service was a calling and--and a sacrifice .
but this is about guys just trying to score some government money
and stacking the deck with my name .
i appreciate how you feel . i do .
but this ?
this isn &apos;t that .
so pretty .
ah . hey , um , after this is over ,
i wanna have a toast to celebrate .
oh . there &apos;ll be plenty of toasts .
oh , no , no , no . for phase two .

so i spent all day in the lab .
it--it &apos;ll take a few weeks ,
but i think i can cure this kid .
medically . you know , once and for all .
what &apos;s going on with you , miranda ?
you &apos;re handing surgeries over to residents .
you &apos;re back in your lab , you know , where you hid
when you first got that infection .
hey , what are you saying ?
well , i &apos;m--i &apos;m worried you &apos;re quitting surgery .
i see .
okay .
while we &apos;re on the subject of quitting surgery ,
maybe it &apos;s time we talked about , uh ,
why the hell you up and quit surgery .
look , i told you , i want my family . i need to be here .
hell , look at you .
do you think we &apos;d have gotten this under control
if i hadn &apos;t been here ?
did it ever occur to you that my symptoms got worse
when you showed up , having quit your job ?
okay .
so , uh , that &apos;s what we &apos;re saying , it ?
thing &apos;s about to start .
mr. evans ?
mr. evans ?
he &apos;s having an m.i ..
get an e.k.g. and a crash cart .
you look so beautiful .
aw ! that &apos;s really sweet .
but , uh ...
you &apos;re gonna be all puffy if you keep that up .
are you gonna get it together ?
yeah .
no , i &apos;m fine .
callie &apos;s trying so hard to forgive me
and to take care of me ,
and it &apos;s driving me crazy .
i thought you wanted--
i do ! i do .
i love her and i want her back .
and i @-@ i broke us . and i--and i wanna fix it .
but she wants to fix me .
the reason that i cheated that night ...
someone was attracted to me .
and she never knew me &quot; before . &quot;
she only knew me &quot; after . &quot;
and i was enough for her .
and callie--you know , she knew me before
and she loved me before .
and now sometimes i @-@ i feel like ...
i &apos;m not ...
i &apos;m not ...
you &apos;re not ?
it &apos;s not fair .
it &apos;s not fair . it &apos;s not her fault .
it &apos;s not her fault that i hate feeling this way .
and callie &apos;s just--she &apos;s trying to--to fix everything .
and i &apos;m finally feeling okay the way that i am now !
and i &apos;m--i &apos;m not sure
that callie will ever make me feel that way .
i &apos;m so sorry that you &apos;re going through all this .
today .
i &apos;m here .
oh , thank god !
acute m.r. he might have a chordal rupture .
we won &apos;t know until we open him up .
i paged you to get yang . yang is his doctor .
yang &apos;s at the wedding . i &apos;m here .
besides , i treated him .
i did a pericardial window by myself .
i know what i &apos;m doing .
then find russell or page the on call doctor .
ruth , clear an o.r. right now and prep him for a sternotomy .
dr. ross . i don &apos;t think so .
we should wait for an attending .
you wanna wait ? we &apos;ll wait .
then you can explain to the attending
how this man died because you wouldn &apos;t let me help him .
is that what you wanna do ?
yang forgot .
i knew one of you would forget .
no .
aah ! thank you !
i knew you &apos;d make it .
okay , so when we get out there , arizona &apos;s gonna take my bouquet .
so if you and meredith can be on either side of my train ...
how dare you say i haven &apos;t changed .
i don &apos;t have to justify my choices to you , not one .
how dare you say i am the same person i was when i got here ,
before i knew burke and owen and you .
your life looks different
because it &apos;s filled with houses and husbands and kids .
and my mine looks the same , but i &apos;m not .
i &apos;ve changed . i &apos;m doing this alone .
and that &apos;s ...
that &apos;s just as hard as what you &apos;re doing .
but i thought i would at least have you .
i &apos;m so jealous of you , i wanna set things on fire .
you did what i tried to do , and i couldn &apos;t .
and you don &apos;t even know how you did it .
you have nothing but time and focus .
you &apos;re not who we were when we got here .
you are who we both set out to be .
and you &apos;ve become something ...
we never saw coming .
you are as good a mother
as you are a surgeon .
and i &apos;m happy for you .
but we are growing apart .
i know .
and i don &apos;t wanna compete with you , but i do ,
because we &apos;re supposed to push each other
and make each other better forever
since the day we met , right ?
right .
okay . so then--
god , i know . i &apos;m so glad because--
oh ! shut up !
today is not the day .
you two--super neat that you &apos;re working your crap out ,
but not today .
and you ! you know what ?
stop talking about adultery on my wedding day ,
because it is my wedding day !
i should be feeling very special right now .
i should be flounced and fluffed up and checked over
and handed tissues and told not to cry with joy .
so just--you know what ?
stop thinking about you , and you make me feel special .
would you like a tissue ?
i &apos;m gonna ...
you looked good .
you know what ? the veil turned out to be so pretty . and you--
the pericardium &apos;s open !
i cannot believe we &apos;re doing this .
all this blood . where is it ? where is it ?
ah . there . ventricular perf .
got it . i got my finger on it .
okay . we put him on bypass , right ? and put a patch on .
no . the perf &apos;s widening already .
i &apos;ll throw a stitch in . i &apos;ve seen yang do it .
2 @-@ 0 silk .
doctor ? bypass--
i have it ! 2 @-@ 0 silk !
oh , god . no , no , no .
it &apos;s tearing . it &apos;s all tearing .
shane , wait .
i can fix this .
i can fix it !
call for help .
who ?
anyone .
shane , his heart wall is disintegrating .
we can just hold pressure and call for help .
i got it . i got it . i &apos;ll do it .
just shut up ! shut up !
shane , get back .
get your hand out of his chest
and get away from the table .
don &apos;t touch her !
i got her !
i got her .
okay , we ready ?
okay .
you made it !
i made it .
oh , great !
come here .
chief !
you came !
of course . the whole hospital &apos;s practically here .
really ?
you &apos;re very well liked .
okay , well , now you have to go ,
&apos;cause i &apos;m gonna start crying .
because if it weren &apos;t for you ,
none of this would be happening to me .
you deserve it , all of it .
and you look beautiful .
thank you .
congratulations .
and how are the kids ?
zola cried &apos; cause she couldn &apos;t come with me ,
but they &apos;re fine now .
oh , she &apos;s spoiled from having you around so much now .
you look spectacular .
thank you .
what ?
listen , i just wanna thank you
because this research is gonna take so much more time
than i expected .
and i couldn &apos;t do it without the time you &apos;re giving me .
and i know you &apos;re turning down a lot of stuff , so thank you .
it &apos;s my pleasure .
you made it .
hi .
we &apos;re the only family we need , right ?
and we &apos;ll be together forever , right ? you and me .
and if we have kids , we &apos;ll be great .
i &apos;ll be a great dad , and you &apos;ll be great ,
and it &apos;ll be just us .
we won &apos;t need anybody else , okay ?
yes . absolutely .
dr.webber , help ! you have to come !
go get re @-@ scrubbed .
ross ?
what do we got here , son ?
i did this .
well , let &apos;s just see , okay ?
so i hear there &apos;s a tear in the right ventricle .
it &apos;s my fault . all i know is , they need webber here
and shepherd wants you to get him .
apparently , he went to deal with the generator .
well , you-- you did well , son .
we &apos;re okay here .
i did this .
you didn &apos;t do anything . this is not your fault .
this just happened .
i think we need some bypass , though .
well , what do you think , ross ?
you did good . we &apos;re all done here .
why--why don &apos;t you go get some rest ?
no !
when i come back , she &apos;ll be dead .
it &apos;s my fault .
i sent her to the basement .
ross , look at me .
look at me .
i got her .
she &apos;s gonna be fine .
go get some rest .
failure is inevitable .
unavoidable .
laps ! more laps !
suction .
murphy , get in here !
let &apos;s get him on bypass .
and let &apos;s take someone from cardio now !
on it .
but failure should never get the last word .

of god &apos;s power
