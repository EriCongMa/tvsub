第十六集
Once upon a time, an evil queen
banished every storybook character you've ever known
to our world.
Who knows the truth
and who can break the spell?
You don't play with the curse.
There is no place for us together.
If I drink that, I'll no longer love him?
You won't even remember who he is.
I told him they should be together.
Bring me his head!
Come on!
It's been 24 hours since Kathryn went missing.
There's a human heart inside it.
We found fingerprints. They were Mary Margaret's.
Red, look out!
We need to move. They found us.
Go. I'll take care of them.
Red, I'm not leaving you.
Find Snow. That's all that matters. Find her!
What are you gonna do?
I'm giving you a head start.
Please turn to the right.
Emma, this is a mistake. I didn't kill Kathryn.
Of course you didn't.
But while I am your friend, I am also the sheriff,
and I have to go where the evidence leads.
Which points to me?
Emma, yesterday it was David.
There's something not right here.
I know, but your fingerprints were on that box,
and his are not...
So now we have to deal with...this.
Evidence that says I cut out Kathryn's heart
and buried it in the woods? This is insane.
If I don't book you, with all this evidence,
it's gonna look like favoritism.
And then Regina will have cause and she will fire me,
and then you know what she'll do?
She'll bring in someone who will railroad you.
So please, just try to be patient and trust me.
We can't even move forward till we verify
the heart belonged to Kathryn,
and I am still waiting for the DNA test results.
But in the meantime, you need to bear with me.
I have to ask you a few questions.
This is crazy.
I would never hurt anyone.
Snow? What are you--
What are you doing?
Getting rid of the vermin in this house.
What do you want?
It's dinnertime.
I'm not hungry.
Come on.
We made something extra special tonight.
She's out of control.
Somebody died?
Snow, why don't you have a seat?
Oh! Why is there a dirty cricket in here?
Uh, my name is Jiminy,
and your friends have asked me to be here tonight.
They're concerned about you
and they have something they'd like to say.
Grumpy, why don't you start?
"Snow White,
"you've changed.
You've become angry, irritable, and downright mean."
Changed?
And who are you to tell me I've changed?
Snow, please, these are your friends,
and we're all here because we--we care about you.
Who wants to go next?
"You brought bales of straw into the house last night.
Even though you know that I'm a...
Allergic."
You are allergic to everything.
You broke my mug!
You're lucky it wasn't that mug you call a face!
You are the worst, most nasty, horrible--
Enough! Look what you're doing to Happy.
That potion you took--
the one that erased the prince from your mind--
you haven't been the same since you drank it.
That helped me forget whatever or whomever I needed to forget,
and I am clearly better off for it.
That potion was the solution, not the problem.
The problem is that I'm living here,
in a house full of dwarves instead of in my palace,
with my father, as a princess,
but I can't do that anymore, can I?
Because he was murdered,
murdered by the same woman
who sent a huntsman to kill me!
Snow, your anger towards the Queen is understandable.
It's just not fair to take it out on your friends.
You're right.
I should be taking it out on her.
Oh, wait. Revenge is not the answer.
No, it's gonna change you.
It'll turn you into something darker than you can imagine.
You don't want to go there.
Oh, no, no.
Good news, fellas
You can quit your complaining, because I'm leaving.
I have more important things to do.
Wait. Don't go!
Snow.
Don't do this!
Wait.
No!
Where are you going?
To kill the Queen.
Hello, Ms. Blanchard.
What is she doing here?
She asked to be here as a third party
to make sure that I stay impartial.
It can only help you.
I have nothing to hide.
Ask me anything.
The heart was found buried near the old toll bridge.
It had been cut out by what appears to be a hunting knife.
Have you ever been to that bridge before?
Yes. Many times.
It's where David and I liked to meet.
Mr. Nolan.
Yes.
And you met there...
for what purpose?
We were having an affair.
I'm not proud of what happened.
And I'm sorry, but that doesn't change the fact
that I did not kill Kathryn.
Ever seen this before?
Yes. It's my jewelry box.
That's what we found the heart in.
Don't you see what's happening here?
Someone stole that box and put the heart in it.
I didn't have anything to do with it. I'm innocent!
Ms. Blanchard,
it's okay.
I know what you're going through.
I know what it's like to lose someone you love,
to be publicly humiliated.
It put me in a very dark place,
changed me.
I can only imagine what losing David Nolan did to you.
But I haven't changed.
I'm still the same person I've always been,
a good person.
I did not do this.
Can I speak to you in the hallway, please?
I told you to leave the questioning to me.
How do you know she didn't do it?
If that box was stolen from her as she claims,
don't you think there'd be signs of a break-in?
You're her roommate. Tell me.
Has there been a break-in?
She is a woman who's had her heart broken,
and that...
that can make you do unspeakable things.
It'll heal...
eventually.
What do you want?
Information. Where's the Queen?
And why would I tell you?
Do you know what a diamond is?
It's the strongest substance known to man or beast--
beautiful, precious,
nearly impervious to destruction.
Nearly.
This...
this is an ax from the dwarf mines.
It's a special blade.
It can, believe it or not,
actually cut a diamond.
Imagine what it can do to human flesh...
soft, pliable,
tender flesh.
She's at her castle,
but only for the night.
In the morning, she leaves for the Summer Palace.
Please! That's all I know.
That Summer Palace was built for my mother.
What do you think you're doing?
I already told you.
I'm going to kill the Queen.
By stealing the armor off a knight?
Whatever I have to do to get into the castle.
So get out of my way.
I have to get there before she departs.
Have you lost your mind?
You really think this disguise is gonna fool anybody?
I'm getting in there.
Listen to yourself!
All you care about is revenge.
You can't even see reality anymore.
What I don't need is
to be lectured by a dwarf with a bad attitude.
I didn't come here to lecture you.
I came here to help you.
Help me?
How?
By taking you back to Rumplestiltskin.
He's the one who gave you the potion in the first place,
the one that took away all your memories of your prince.
If anyone can give 'em back to you, it's him.
I don't want my memories back. That's why I took the potion.
And it changed you.
Maybe he can at least bring you back
to the person you used to be.
He's the most powerful man in the world.
He can do anything.
Anything?
Henry. What are you doing here?
Why aren't you in school?
We have to help Ms. Blanchard.
I am helping her. That's why I'm searching the apartment.
But you gotta go home.
Not gonna happen.
Just stay out of the way.
So what are we looking for?
I'm trying to see if maybe someone broke in.
Looking for busted doorjambs, broken glass,
muddy boot prints-- that kind of thing.
So you think someone's setting her up.
It's the only thing that makes sense.
The only problem is nobody's got a motive.
My mom does.
Regina?
She hates Snow White.
Hey, you wanted a motive.
Well, I don't think "She hates Snow White"
will hold up in a court, Henry.
Did you find something?
I don't think that hot chocolate's gonna drink itself.
You're upset about your teacher, aren't you?
She didn't do it.
Why can't anyone see it?
Cause most people just see what's right in front of them.
And I don't think you're gonna find the answers you want
at the bottom of that mug.
Then where?
That book in your bag?
You know I'm a writer.
So I'm partialo finding my answers in the literary form.
It's just a book.
Is it?
Yeah.
I think we both know that's not the case.
Can I get a water please?
What do you know about it?
I know it's a book of stories.
Aren't all books?
Stories... that really happened.
You think my book is real?
As real as I am.
How do you know?
Let's just say that, uh...I'm a believer,
And I want to help others see the light.
That, my friend, that's why I'm here.
But I already believe.
Oh, I'm not here for you, buddy.
I'm here for Emma.
So you want to get her to believe?
Why don't you just tell her?
Well, there are some people-- like you and me--
We can go on faith,
but others, like Emma, they need proof.
Last time I tried to find proof,
I got trapped in a sinkhole.
There are less dangerous places to look.
Put your hands where I can see 'em.
Second thought, don't.
Who did this?
She's crazy. She had a pickax.
She threatened to skin me.
The Evil Queen?
No. Snow White.
What?
She said she wanted to kill the Queen.
I've never seen someone so bloodthirsty.
No. Snow is not bloodthirsty.
She is not a killer. I know her.
Maybe you don't.
Hey. Can I talk to you?
Of course.
These accusations against Mary Margaret--
They've been gnawing away at me.
She didn't do this.
I understand what you're going through.
It's painful when someone we care about betrays us.
She's a good person. I know her.
Maybe you don't.
Maybe you just want to.
Everyone has a dark side, David.
Yeah, sure, but having a dark side
and doing something so evil--
That's a different thing. That's not what she is.
Perhaps.
I always believe that evil isn't born.
It's made.
All due respect, Regina,
I don't think you know much about evil.
Well, if she didn't do it, then who did?
I don't know. That's what I've been trying to figure out.
But those blackouts I've been having--
they made everything so hazy.
Please tell me you're not accusing yourself.
You know, maybe if I could clear up my missing time,
I could prove Mary Margaret's innocence.
You're very sweet, David.
But you're also wrong.
Evil doesn't always look evil.
Sometimes it's staring right at us,
and we don't even realize it.
The heating vent?
Emma, I don't even know
where the heating vent in my bedroom is.
Well, someone did, and they put a hunting knife in there.
I checked for signs of a break-in,
but there weren't any.
You don't believe me.
Of course I do.
But what I think doesn't matter.
The evidence is piling up by the hour.
Okay, what are you saying?
I'm saying you should think about hiring a lawyer.
An excellent idea.
Mr. Gold.
What are you doing here?
Offering my legal services.
You're a lawyer?
Ever wondered why I was so adept at contracts?
I've been following the details of your case, Ms. Blanchard.
And I think you'd be well-advised
to bring me on as your counsel.
And why is that?
Well, because the sheriff had me arrested
for nearly beating a man to death,
and I managed to persuade the judge to drop the charges.
Asserting your influence isn't what's needed here.
We need to find the truth.
Exerting influence may be exactly what's needed here.
What's needed here is for me to do my job.
Well, no one's stopping you. I'm only here to help.
Enough.
Please go.
You heard her.
No, I was talking to you.
Oh, Emma, he's right. I need help.
And you need to do your job, or else I'm screwed.
So just please,
do your job the best you can,
and you'll prove me innocent.
Until you do, I need some practical help.
Trust me.
This is in Ms. Blanchard's best interests.
Good luck, Mary Margaret.
I hope your best interests
are what he's looking out for.
I can't pay you.
I didn't ask for money.
Then why are you doing this?
Let's just say...
I'm invested in your future.
The potion you gave Snow--
It changed her. She's not the same.
Well, of course it changed her.
It took away her love,
left a big hole in her heart.
There is no cure for what she's got.
The person she was...
there's no way to bring her back.
No potion can bring back true love.
Love...
Is the most powerful magic of all,
The only magic I haven't been able to bottle.
If you can bottle love,
you can do anything.
But you don't care about that, do ya?
Now what is it you really want?
I want your help...
To kill the Queen.
Now we're talking, dearie.
Snow, don't.
Now what is this?
This... is how you kill the Queen.
How will that help me get into the castle?
No, no, no. That's impossible.
You have to kill her when she's on the move,
when she's on her way...
to the Summer Palace.
Fire the arrow from this spot here,
and you'll be hidden from sight.
An arrow fired from this bow
will give you exactly what you need.
It always finds its target.
I can't stand by.
If you take that weapon, you do it alone.
That was always my plan.
So what do I have to do in return?
Do?
You don't have to do anything, dearie.
Everything comes with a price with you.
Last time you took a strand of my hair.
What's in it for you this time?
Let's just say...
I'm invested in your future.
David. What can I do for you?
Dr. Hopper, I need your help.
Okay. What--what is it?
I've been having these blackouts,
and I need to remember what happened during them.
Why?
I think I might know something that can help Mary Margaret.
Rumplestiltskin!
Show yourself.
Still dressing like a prince, I see,
Even though you ran away from the life I gave you.
How's that for gratitude?
You gave me a prison sentence.
Yeah, one that you've now skirted.
Careful, dearie.
King George is a vengeful man,
I'm here about Snow.
Rumor has it she's after the Queen
and she came to you for help.
Yes, indeed.
What did you do to her?
What did I do to her?
You mean what did you do to her.
You caused her pain.
Without that pain,
she would never have drank my potion to forget about you.
That's what changed her.
Undo the potion. All magic can be broken.
Oh, yes, with two wuv.
So that's it then? True love's kiss will awaken her.
Most certainly.
But it's gonna be hard to kiss her
when you don't know where she is.
Name your price.
How about...
your cloak?
My cloak? Why would you want my cloak?
It's drafty in here.
Where is she?
On her way to the Queen's highway.
This is the route she's taking.
But you better be quick,
because if she kills the Queen,
she becomes as evil
as the woman whose life she takes.
She could never become that evil
Evil isn't born, dearie.
It's made.
If Snow starts down that road
you'll get her back!
Get your hands off me!
Snow.
Who are you? What are you doing?!
I'm helping you remember.
I told you, I will always find you.
I have proof.
This is how my mom got into your apartment.
This is how she framed Ms. Blanchard.
Did you steal these from her office?
Yeah.
The book said they could open any door.
There's no way they'll even fit in the lock.
We have to try.
See? What did I tell you?
Come on, Henry. I know you want to think
the answer to everything is in Operation Cobra.
It is!
But sometimes the real world needs to come first.
Just try one more.
Please.
Okay, one more, but then we're done.
You do it.
This one.
Okay.
Do you believe now?
I assume you're the man
Rumplestiltskin helped me forget.
What's your name again?
It's me, Charming.
Charming?
Beginning to see why I drank that potion.
This doesn't make any sense.
True love's kiss should've restored your memories.
It's not true love...
Because I don't love you.
Yes, you do. You just don't remember.
You love me, and I love you.
Words. Words. Words.
That's all that love is.
And unfortunately for you,
words don't mean anything to me.
You know what does mean somemething to me?
Taking action, and that's exactly
what I'm going to go do.
Snow.
Snow, listen to me!
You can't do this.
It's not who you want to be. You can't kill her.
Really?
Watch me.
Don't do it!
Snow!
Snow!
David, listen very closely. Can you hear me?
Yes.
Good.
Okay, I want you to go back in your memory,
back to the last time you and Kathryn spoke,
the last thing you remember.
Tell me--where are you?
In my bedroom.
When?
The night she left.
And what were you doing?
I called her on her cell.
And what did you talk about?
She said she realized she needed to start a new life,
without me.
She thought Mary Margaret and I should be together.
And how did that conversation end?
She said she was hurt...
But she wanted me to be happy.
And do you remember anything after that?
Yes.
I saw Mary Margaret in the woods.
And what was she doing there?
You can't kill her.
Really?
Watch me.
Don't do it.
David.
David!
What happened?
I had to wake you up. You went too deep into hypnosis.
Something was disturbing you. What did you see?
It was...
What?
Tell me, David. I can help you.
David.
David, tell me. What did you see? I can help you.
No, you can't.
David!
Come on. Get out of here.
You must be James.
You can talk?
Yeah, and you can listen. Name's Jiminy.
When Snow began acting differently,
her friends the Dwarves asked me to intervene,
But I'm--I'm--I'm afraid I-I wasn't much help.
I didn't do any better.
Can you get me out of here? I have to stop her.
Well, I'll try.
What's your plan?
I don't know.
I tried everything to make her remember who I am,
but nothing worked.
Give that a try.
It sounds like you're approaching this the wrong way,
how can she remember who you are
when she's lost sight of who she is?
Clear the road!
Bow your heads before the Queen!
What do you think you're doing?!
Why would you do this?!
Well, because...
You said you appreciate... action more than words.
So now...
You're gonna get both.
I love you, Snow.
But I don't love you.
I don't even remember you.
Well, I don't care.
The only thing I care about
is that you don't forget who you really are.
I would rather die than let you fill your heart with darkness.
You would really die for me?
Does it look like I'm making this up?
No one's ever done anything like this for me before.
No one's ever been willing to die for me.
No one you can remember.
Charming.
Yes.
It's me.
King George's army.
Halt!
No! Oh!
Prince James.
Leave the girl.
We have who we came for.
No!
James!
No!
Enough!
Snow.
Snow!
James!
Snow!
I will find you!
I will always find you.
Mary Margaret.
David.
Emma said we could have a few minutes alone.
I wanted to tell you that Dr. Hopper helped me
remember what happened during my blackouts.
And?
I only, um...
Got pieces of the memory, but...
We were in the woods,
and I kept saying, "Don't do it."
Don't do what?
"Don't kill her."
That's what I kept saying.
Kathryn?
You think you remember me wanting to kill Kathryn?
Can you explain why I have that memory?
David...
Are you asking me if I had something to do
with Kathryn's murder?
The sheriff found a heart in our spot.
It was in your jewelry box.
The weapon was found in your apartment.
I have have these... these memories.
So, yes, I'm asking.
When your phone records came back,
when I found you wandering in the woods,
when everyone thought you killed Kathryn,
I stood by you.
I never once doubted you.
And now that everything is pointing to me...
You actually think that I am capable of that kind of evil?
Get... out.
What's this?
An apology.
We don't care about mugs.
It's the only thing I broke that I could replace.
I'm sorry.
All I can say is...
I'm sorry.
It's you.
It's me.
Oh, welcome back.
Thank you.
You can have your old room if you like.
Oh. Thank you.
I can't stay.
Where are you going?
King George took James.
I have to get him back.
No, Snow, you can't do it.
I can't let the king just kill him.
He came back for me. It doesn't matter what happens to me now.
I have to try.
That's not what I meant.
What I meant was
you can't do it alone.
But luckily, you won't have to.
Let's show that king
what Snow White and Seven Dwarves can really do!
Hey. Breakfast.
Thanks.
I know Mr. Gold doesn't want us to talk,
but I thought you should hear this from me.
The test results came back on the heart,
and the D.N.A. was a match for Kathryn.
She's dead.
I'm sorry...
for a lot of things.
But now that we have proof of the death,
we have enough evidence
to move forward with a case against you.
It's gonna happen.
You know I do believe you, right?
Yeah.
All this evidence tells me one thing for certain--
that you are being framed,
and I think Regina's behind it.
Then why am I still in here? Why don't you confront her?
Because belief is not proof.
But you just said.
If I don't do this right,
things will end up worse for you.
Every time I've gone up against Regina,
she's seen it coming, and I've lost.
So what makes this time any different?
Because she doesn't know I suspect anything.
Why would she do this to me?
I don't know, but I'm gonna find out,
and I promise, I won't stop until I expose what she's up to.
And how are you going to do that? This is her town.
I'm working on it.
I have faith in you.
And now I need you
to have faith in me.
Can you do that?
Of course.
Mr. Gold.
Just taking inventory.
What can I do for you, Ms. Swan?
Any developments in the case I should be aware of?
Yes. Regina set her up.
And this surprises you?
Show me your evidence, and we'll get this over with immediately.
Yeah. That's the thing. There isn't any--
Anything that's court-worthy.
But I know it now.
Look who's suddenly become a woman of faith.
Why are you here, Ms. Swan? To spin conspiracy theories?
I need help.
From me?
Every time I've gone up against Regina, I've lost,
except for once, when I became sheriff,
when you helped.
As I recall, you don't exactly approve of my methods.
I approve of your results.
And this time, I have something more important than a job.
I need to save my friend.
And you're willing to go as far as it takes?
Farther.
Now we're talking.
Fear not, Ms swan.
Regina may be powerful,
but something tells me
