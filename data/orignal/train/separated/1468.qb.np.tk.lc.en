jay ?
have you seen the grapes ?
yeah , i ate them .
why would you eat the grapes ?
they were in a bowl , they were washed ,
i paid for them .
they were for the new year &apos;s .
oh , right . what &apos;s that goofy thing again ?
it &apos;s not goofy . it &apos;s a tradition .
at midnight , you eat 12 grapes ,
you make 12 wishes , 1 for each month of the year .
and you really think that works ?
five years ago ,
i was a single mother living in a slum .
today , i &apos;m driving to palm springs
in my new car with my rich husband .
you do what you want . i &apos;m eating the grapes .
for new year &apos;s eve , we &apos;re taking phil and claire
and mitch and cam to this amazing hotel
i used to go to in palm springs .
they got a whole package--
dinner , dancing , toast at midnight .
i mean , what more do you need ?
grapes .
i said we &apos;d stop on the way .
haley , it &apos;s new year &apos;s eve .
are you sure you don &apos;t wanna go to a party or something ?
and listen to all my friends talk about
how awesome college is ?
i know how awesome college is .
that &apos;s what got me kicked out .
well , i &apos;m sure uncle mitchell
will feel much better leaving lily here
knowing that you &apos;re in charge .
you know you &apos;re really in charge , right ?
how do you know i don &apos;t have a party ?
okay , fine .
lily , are you ready for your big sleepover with your cousins ?
who &apos;s watching me ?
haley .
i &apos;m serious .
alex .
okay , let &apos;s go .
every new year &apos;s eve , it &apos;s like ,
&quot; what are we gonna do ? what are we gonna do ? &quot;
so we were happy that jay planned this whole thing .
it really , you know , takes the pressure off
of having to outdo ourselves .
yeah , and how are we gonna possibly top last year ?
oh . did we miss it ?
it &apos;s only 10 : 00 .
what ?
it &apos;s only 10 : 00 .
what ?
it &apos;s only 10 : 00 .
place is smaller than i remember .
smaller &apos;s your issue ?
when was the last time that you were here , jay ?
not that long ago . 1974 , &apos; 75 .
so when i was 2 ?
i don &apos;t like when you do that .
i checked the web site . the pictures looked beautiful .
oh ! lizard . huh ?
never trust pictures on the internet .
shoot it from the right angle ,
you can make anything look bigger and better .
houses , you pervs . he &apos;s a realtor .
i thought i heard voices .
robby ! i told you ! it &apos;s people .
oh , my god . that &apos;s me in 20 years !
okay , you be her , and i &apos;ll be whoever left her .
uh , we &apos;re checking in . it &apos;s under pritchett .
jay pritchett . three rooms .
you &apos;ve been with us before .
how old is that book ?
oh , there is something sticky over here .
robby !
it came back .
it &apos;s not possible .
okay , so the place is not what it used to be .
but we &apos;re gonna have fun .
dining in the starlight room ,
little dancing with the shelley stroman trio .
oh , there &apos;s just two left . here are your keys .
check out &apos;s at 11 : 00 , but if you wanna stay longer--
11 : 00 is good .
here we go .
is there anything wrong ?
no , no . no , we were just hoping for something
a little more romantic .
come on , now .
it &apos;s not that bad .
what &apos;s in there ?
nothing .
if you &apos;re looking for romance ,
there &apos;s a secluded hot spring nearby .
kind of a hidden gem .
huh ?
just follow the path
right by the 12th hole of the golf course .
that sounds kinda nice .
secluded . natural .
sexy .
sexy .
what do you think , phil ?
does it smell like eggs ?
some of them smell like eggs .
it &apos;s been a while since phil and i ...
the whole month of december ?
not even a ...
or a quick ... you know ?
it &apos;s embarrassing , and it &apos;s not like us .
that &apos;s making me anxious ,
which is why i really need to get ...
thanks again .
yeah , that &apos;s yours to keep .
okay .
bye now .
i say we bag dinner with my dad ,
and go find that hot spring .
honey , we can &apos;t just ditch your father .
he wanted us all to be together .
we are always together .
oh , my god , what are we gonna hear
that we &apos;ve never heard before ?
mitch and cam &apos;s inspiring story
of how lily saved that kid with the heimlich ?
please . she hugged him ,
and he spit his gum out .
i say we get a bottle of champagne ,
look up at the stars ,
forget our bathing suits .
that does sound hot .
but i &apos;d just be thinking about your dad the whole time .
i &apos;m gonna hop in the shower .
what &apos;s in there ?
nothing .
oh , perfect . no , great .
if we need any socks ,
someone left one in the bed .
oh , my gosh . there is no way crispin stays here
when he comes to the beacon .
what &apos;s the beacon ?
the club that he &apos;s always raving about .
it &apos;s right down the street .
that &apos;s where we should go .
somewhere fun for new year &apos;s ,
while we &apos;re still young ... ish .
l @-@ let &apos;s get out of dinner and go there .
how ?
i don &apos;t know .

you know , fake a cough , stomachache ,
dealer &apos;s choice . i don &apos;t care .
just sell it and get us out of there .
but what about your dad ?
he wants the family to be together .
we are always together .
i mean , how many times do we have to hear claire tell us
luke &apos;s hilarious comeback to the pediatrician ?
oh , gosh . we should start calling her &quot; ranch house ... &quot;
because she doesn &apos;t have a second story .
so good .
i know ! thank you .
hey . you sure you don &apos;t wanna play
&quot; the hunger games &quot; with all of us ?
my whole life is a hunger game .

yeah , let me tell it .
okay .
jay , you should go back and spend time with your family .
i can &apos;t leave you alone on new year &apos;s eve ,

billy dee &apos;s an alderman
trying to keep diana ross in chicago ,
rather than become
an international model and designer .
my son made me watch it with him .
he &apos;s gay .
oh , good . i didn &apos;t want to be the one to tell you .
excuse me ! sir , excuse me !
he &apos;s doing this on purpose !
he probably just doesn &apos;t notice us .
how can he not notice us ?
we &apos;re the only people in here in sleeves !
hey there . what can i get for ya ?
excuse me , young man . i was here first .
young man ? why don &apos;t you just call him whipper @-@ snapper ?
this is ridiculous . we can &apos;t even get a drink .

you really think they &apos;re doing something in there ? he &apos;s 12 .
he &apos;s 14 , but it &apos;s touching how close you are .
fine .
what do you want ?
you have to keep your door open .
why ?
uh , well , why do you need it closed ?
because we &apos;re gonna make out .
well , you ...
you can &apos;t have your door closed .
why ? do you wanna to watch or something ?
that &apos;s weird .
of course we don &apos;t wanna watch .
perfect .
but you can &apos;t ...
what are you d ...
what just happened ?
can i offer you a pinja delgado ?
it &apos;s my own concoction .
what &apos;s in it ?
let &apos;s just say it &apos;s cool , it &apos;s sweet ,
and it &apos;s not afraid to embrace its own whimsy .
i &apos;m not saying that .
i &apos;m not drinking it , either .
so ... you making any resolutions ?
yeah . no more blind dates .
you &apos;re mean .
you know , she &apos;s right , joyce . you are mean .
i &apos;ve been a gracious host
while you &apos;ve been rude , sullen , and dull .
you &apos;ll forgive me if i choose not to start the new year
on such a negative note .
oh , and if you &apos;re hungry for broccoli later ,
you &apos;ll find a piece in your teeth .
where is this stupid path ?
we &apos;ve been walking forever .
we &apos;ll find it .
did that bellman seem a little off to you ?
oh , totally . maybe there is no hot spring .
maybe this is all part of an elaborate plan to kill us .
why would you even say that ?
i &apos;m just trying to lighten the mood .
you seem so tense .
come on . this is an adventure . this is fun .
i don &apos;t wanna have an adventure .
i don &apos;t wanna have fun . i wanna have sex with you .
wha--what ?
don &apos;t make me say it again .
no , i want you to say it again .
maybe throw my name in there this time .
claire , what &apos;s going on ?
do you know that it &apos;s been a month ?
no , it hasn &apos;t .
yes , it has .
day after thanksgiving .
i remember because i came in under budget
on all of my christmas gifts ,
and you know how that gets me going .
oh , yeah .
yeah .
i made that joke about your clothes being half @-@ off .
and yet we still did it ,
&apos;cause that &apos;s the kind of people we used to be .
what happened ?
nothing happened . we &apos;re busy .
it was the holidays . dede was here .
you know , she has a way of ...
shutting that whole thing down .
but is this who we are now ?
i mean , first it &apos;s a month , then it &apos;s a year ,
then we &apos;re sleeping in twin beds
and you &apos;re calling me &quot; mother . &quot;
and i can &apos;t even bear it ,
&apos;cause we &apos;re just like my grandp--
let &apos;s go find that hot spring
and start this new year off with ...
sex in a hot spring .
all right , all right .
where--where should we try next ?
am i yelling ? i &apos;m yelling .
yes .
yeah . maybe we should just go get some frozen yogurt
and call it a night .
no , cam , come on .
we can &apos;t have another new year &apos;s eve
where we don &apos;t even make it to midnight .
i ... this entire holiday
is just a giant reminder of how the clock is ticking .
you know , each passing second
is just bringing us that much closer to death .
all this because i suggested some fro @-@ yo ?
i &apos;m ... i &apos;m sick of feeling old .
i @-@ i really need this .
okay .
let &apos;s get you to midnight .
&apos;kay .
oh , look , he &apos;s our age .
wherever he &apos;s going , i &apos;m sure he &apos;ll fit right in .
okay .
okay , no judgment .
perfectly acceptable lifestyle .
just not for us .
no !
okay , but we are not giving up , all right ?
we &apos;re like goldilocks .
the first bar was too young ,
the second was ... whatever that was ,
and the third will be just right .
mitchell ...
three bears .
i mean ... right ?
here . this one .
you wanted to feel young .
and i do .
i &apos;m sorry . i push people away .
i feel myself do it , but i can &apos;t stop .
it &apos;s hard to like someone when you don &apos;t like yourself .
you &apos;re right .
you have so many good qualities .
you &apos;re attractive , you &apos;re witty , you &apos;re bright .
i just wish you could see yourself through my eyes .
aw , you &apos;re such a good friend .
friend ? that &apos;s where this is headed ?
well ... friendships last longer .
not this one . i &apos;ve got enough friends .
happy new year , joyce .
so what &apos;s the plan , haley ?
i &apos;m going in . that &apos;s our baby brother up there .
i &apos;m not ready for all of this .
the girls , the hormones-- it &apos;s gross .
well , we can &apos;t just barge in .
i &apos;m still trying to get the image of mom and dad
out of my ... oh , god , it &apos;s back .
i &apos;m coming in !
what are you doing ?
just putting away some laundry .
that &apos;s a bra .
and a tablecloth .
can &apos;t you do this later ?
excuse me . does your mother know you &apos;re here ?
yes .
does she know our parents aren &apos;t ?
yeah .
big pause , no eye contact .
i was so much better at this than you .
you &apos;re out .
no , she &apos;s not .
yes , she is . it &apos;s late , you &apos;re 13 ...
14 .
14,
and unless nicole bitchie here
wants me to call her parents and tell them she lied ...
i better go . bye , luke .
wait . why does she have to go ?
because i said so .
you &apos;re not the boss .
don &apos;t talk back to your sister .
ugh ! i hate you !
you hate me now , but someday you &apos;ll thank me !
i think i owe mom a huge apology .
is anyone watching me ?
aces and eights .
lady sings the blues . three jacks .
sorry , billy dee ,
but where do you go to tattle on prince harry
when he &apos;s naked in vegas ?
straight to the queen .
well , that &apos;s it . i &apos;m out .
me , too .
oh , hell , it &apos;s almost 11 : 00 .
i gotta do my set in the starlight room ,
and i &apos;m missing a pasty .
oh , what &apos;s the matter with everybody ? it &apos;s early yet .
yeah , i &apos;m having fun
for the first time since i got here .
jay ?
how long has she been there ?
what are you doing here ?
gloria ...
everybody ditched me ,
these guys invited me to play poker ,
and look who i &apos;m sitting next to .
oh , she has no idea .
hello , i &apos;m billy dee williams .
hello . i &apos;m gloria dee wife .
jay , it &apos;s almost midnight , and we forgot to buy my grapes .
did you try room service ? they probably have grapes .
oh , nothing fresh .
but you can always fish some out of a can of fruit cocktail .
jay , you know that i need real grapes for my wishes .
it &apos;s a colombian tradition . it &apos;s only moderately insane .
well , i have grapes at my house .
no , i don &apos;t want you to blow new year &apos;s .
oh , please . every night is new year &apos;s for billy dee .
i like you , billy dee .
so at midnight , you eat them and then you make your wishes .
well , that sounds vaguely familiar .
i might have heard about that
when i did that &quot; love boat &quot; with charo .
you know charo ?
he &apos;s so obsessed with charo .
no kidding .
oh , my god .
a classic rolls corniche .
i have been in love with this car my whole life .
in my village , if you didn &apos;t drive one of these ,
you couldn &apos;t call yourself a drug lord .
would you like to drive it ?
does the bear sit in the woods ?
classic charo .
so ...
was it worth my meltdown ?
it always is .
just you and me , under the desert sky .
i &apos;m lawrence of arabia ,
you &apos;re mrs ...
of arabia .
hey there .

new year &apos;s is so weird ,

people put so much pressure on themselves to have fun .
seven ... six ... five ...
i mean , i guess i sorta get it .
four ... three ... two ... one !

oh , my god , what is in this ?
oh . sorry . that one &apos;s mine .
