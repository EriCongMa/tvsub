oh , honey , more overtime ?
i was hoping you &apos;d be home .
no , it &apos;s okay .
i understand .
yeah , i got all the way there with the baby ,
and he was out on an emergency .
that &apos;s weird . the heat &apos;s off .
i love you , too , honey .
you look a little ... naked .
excuse me ?
i can see your knees .
you want me to write him up for harassment ?
yes .
you do look nice , though .
i always like you in your court outfits .
you can write yourself up , too .
did you hear about cal ?
cal ghetts died ?
how &apos;s miss ghetts doing ?
nice lady .
i always see her in church .
how &apos;d he die ?
he was mugged last night in atlantic city .
didn &apos;t he just retire ?
a month ago .
30 years in the arson unit , and he gets shot on vacation .
nervous about testifying ?
i &apos;ve only done it once .
all cavanaugh and i have to do
is establish chain of custody
to get paddy &apos;s ledger admitted into evidence .
i &apos;ll be glad when you get rid of that copy of his damn book .
can i see it ?
no .
and you don &apos;t want to .
yes , i do .
wait , you guys didn &apos;t read it ?
i &apos;m from southie , frost .
for all i know , i got cousins in that book .
i see you downloaded a copy of the federal indictment .
it &apos;s interesting .
you ever tried a rico case before ?
no .
me either .
look at all these counts -- loan @-@ sharking , bookmaking ,
trafficking in narcotics -- oh , and 15 counts of murder .
how did the feds establish that paddy ordered the hits ?
rico case is all about proving
that paddy was the head of a crime syndicate ,
and he didn &apos;t have to pull the trigger himself .
with donovan &apos;s testimony ,
the government can prove paddy was behind 15 murders .
so , why &apos;s the book so important ?
it corroborates his story .
this is the only guy still alive
that can tie paddy to all those murders .
rizzoli , gonna need you in my office .
a.u.s.a. &apos; s here .
good luck .
you don &apos;t have to say a word
if you just show the judge those knees .
the judge is a woman .
hope .
i was going to leave these at your door , but i saw your car .
come in .
we always said we were going to have coffee .
thank you .
is angela here ?
no .
she is out of town , visiting her sister .
i am playing hooky .
i was just about to make some espresso .
ah , la pavoni .
oh , i had one once .
la pavoni was founded in milan in 1905 --
by desiderio pavoni ,
uh , in a little workshop on via parini .
uh , el salvador miravalle and
i also smell brazil , fazenda cachoeria .
hmm ?
that &apos;s amazing .
where you think you came from ?
cailin puts goopy syrup in hers .
no idea where she came from .
she &apos;s 19 .
you know , i hate to admit it ,
but i was addicted to corn syrup at that age .
i wish i &apos;d known you then .
and i wish that you had known him .
this is not the man that i fell in love with ,
not the man who fathered you .
how did you meet ?
i was studying ,
and i saw him drawing me , so we started talking .
is it hard for you to look at that ?
it &apos;s his drawing of you at 19,
mourning my death .
my mother -- constance --
she -- she hung it in a hallway .
i don &apos;t know why i -- i always liked it .
and now that i know my own story ,
i just stare at it and think about what might have been .
i think about what might have been , too .
he was thoughtful and smart and unbelievably kind .
and that sounds crazy now .
i &apos;ve never said this to anyone .
it could be easily misinterpreted .
but i &apos;ve caught him looking at me ,
and i see that man .
oh , that hurt .
let me see .
oh , it &apos;s fine .
the steam wand is 240 degrees . you &apos;re not fine .
go . run this under cold water .
i have some extra bandages in that drawer .
actually , i prefer hemostatic trauma gauze .
what , you carry it with you ?
since 1988 .
i took care of saddam &apos;s burn victims in northern iraq .
that &apos;s not too bad .
no .
are you going to the trial ?
no , i can &apos;t watch them put him away .
do you think you &apos;ll have to testify --
i mean , about m.e.n.d. ?
no .
it seems that the fbi has more pressing things to do
than to shut down an international aid organization .
so , you &apos;re not worried that someday they &apos;ll just come in
and seize the $ 2.5 million that paddy gave you to start m.e.n.d. ?
i will talk with you about anything but that .
the less you know , the safer you are .
i know you don &apos;t approve of what i &apos;ve done .
paddy terrorized an entire community .
that &apos;s how he got that money .
but that money ultimately saved
the lives of a lot of innocent people .
yeah , but you can &apos;t forget that it also cost
the lives of a lot of innocent people .
what paddy did is indefensible ...
and maybe what i &apos;ve done is , too .
there .
all better .
so , after we get through establishing your credentials ,
i will hold up the book , walk you through my questions .
and once the book is admitted , jackie donovan becomes key .
yes .
i don &apos;t envy you guys .
jackie &apos;s wife , roberta , is a handful .
god . no kidding .
we &apos;ve been moving them
every 24 hours for a year because of her .
you knew her ?
yeah . i grow up in southie .
that &apos;s right .
paddy was your c.i.
paddy doyle was your informant ?
yeah , we asked the lieutenant to keep that quiet
until we knew we didn &apos;t need him for our rico case .
it &apos;s gonna sound strange , but when i was growing up ,
we all looked up to paddy doyle .
when the colombians started moving cocaine through southie ,
he reached out to me .
he wanted the drugs out of the neighborhood , same as me .
you &apos;re not getting sentimental on me , are you , lieutenant ?
he did one good thing . he &apos;s still a bad guy .
i can &apos;t wait for this to be over .
yeah , me , too .
i &apos;ve been practicing this opening argument for 20 years .
wish me luck .
you &apos;re not gonna need luck .
we &apos;ll get him .
that stuff is so bad for you .
we got the non @-@ fat creamer in the break room .
i need something with fat in it today .
did you know that paddy was cavanaugh &apos;s c.i. ?
yeah .
in 93 , we worked the d.c.u. together .
i was doing the new york crack boys .
he was working the colombians .
what ? what is it ?
oh , nothing , i ...
every time i think about working drugs with him ,
i think about linda and his son .
doesn &apos;t he have a daughter , too ?
they &apos;re not close .
he wasn &apos;t married to the mother .
that &apos;s linda and christopher .
they died in a fire .
defective gas valve filled the cellar with gas ,
ignited when linda turned on the heat .
cavanaugh was working overtime when we got the news .
i thought we &apos;d never get
him back from the bottom of a shot glass .
that had to be hard to watch a tough guy like cavanaugh
go through something like that .
i don &apos;t ever want to see anything like it again .
are you heading to court ?
uh , no , it &apos;s maura . i &apos;m gonna go check on her .
she sick ?
sick of being in the news .
maura !
in here .
what are you doing ?
child &apos;s pose . it &apos;s good for indigestion .
only you would have a yoga room .
no shoes .
sorry .
do you want me to chant something
to ward off the evil shoe spirits ?
couldn &apos;t hurt .
oh , that feels great . i could do this all day .
the judge would issue a bench warrant for you if you did .
i got your text .
so , you and hope geeked out over coffee ?
that sounds nice .
it wasn &apos;t .
i gave her a hard time .
you know , she &apos;s saved thousands of innocent people
who were caught in wars and natural disasters , but ...
but you just can &apos;t get over the fact
that her humanitarian organization only exists
because she took paddy &apos;s dirty money ?
exactly .
show me a yoga pose that ends all problems .
mm , we &apos;d have to move to the yoga colony
in shivajinagar , pune .
poo @-@ na ?
i &apos;m not moving to poo @-@ na .
do you miss your father ?
yeah , i do .
you think if i tracked him down in florida
and forced myself to watch him
snuggle with his slutty blond girlfriend
that i wouldn &apos;t miss him so much ?
no .
what makes you think she &apos;s blond ?
they &apos;re always blond .
okay , i got to go to court .
i &apos;m coming with you .
you sure ?
you don &apos;t have to do that .
yes , i do .
that man is my father ,
and i have to see this through .
and could you describe the location , detective ?
oh , the boston cemetery .
and can you tell us what you found there ?
a plastic bag with a blue ledger in it .
detective , is this the ledger that you found ?
yes .
thank you . no further questions .
okay , we &apos;re off to a good start .
thank you , both .
okay .
what ? what is it ?
your phones were off . jackie donovan is dead .
what ? !
u.s. marshals &apos; car he was in was t @-@ boned by a semi
on congress and atlantic avenue about 10 minutes ago .
that &apos;s just around the corner .
jackie donovan &apos;s dead .
paddy got to him .
it looks like it .
two u.s. marshals are dead , too .
so , what does this mean for the trial ?
it means paddy won the first round .
it is obvious that this is no accident , your honor .
five minutes before our key witness is supposed to testify
and half a block away from your courtroom ,
he is killed by teamsters driving a truck ?
i think we all know who &apos;s behind this .
your honor , there &apos;s no evidence
that this is anything more than a tragic accident .
&quot; tragic accident . &quot;
the government asks for two days to regroup .
two @-@ day delay ? does counsel think he can resurrect a dead man ?
as tragic as this is ,
let me remind you this trial has already started .
call your next witness .
your honor , the prosecution had anticipated ...
why can &apos;t he call his next witness ?
he doesn &apos;t have another witness ready ,
and he certainly doesn &apos;t have another jackie donovan .
your honor , my client has been in jail for over a year .
the entirety of the government &apos;s case
seems to rest on a now dead witness .
we just need a continuance , your honor .
we &apos;ll be ready in 48 hours .
at the very least , my client should be considered for bail .
bail ?
they &apos;ll never do that .
and in a twist
legal pundits will be talking about for years ,
the judge granted bail
for the alleged head of the southie crime family ,
paddy doyle .
the federal government
has been skating on thin ice for a long time ,
and today , they fell in .
thank you .
clearly , the judge was stuck
between a rock and a hard place .
the prosecution wasn &apos;t ready to proceed ...
i don &apos;t believe this .
why are they shaking his hand ?
they &apos;re from southie -- if paddy &apos;s out ,
you want to be on his good side .
the judge had no choice
but to reconsider the issue of bail .
he can &apos;t get away with this .
i would &apos;ve said that yesterday . i don &apos;t know about today .
did you get him to talk ?
oh , yeah . can &apos;t get him to stop .
he said my father hired a couple of teamsters
to run their truck into the marshals &apos; van .
said it was pretty quick ,
except for the one who bled out before the ambulance arrived .
poor guys -- just doing their jobs .
and how are we supposed to do ours ?
i mean , he &apos;s out , jane . how did this happen ?
how ? we &apos;ll , he &apos;s always eight chess moves ahead .
where do you think you got your i.q. points ?
don &apos;t remind me .
he &apos;ll only be out for a couple of days ,
and they got him wearing the ankle bracelet .
i &apos;m sure the feds are watching his every move .
we may have something .
well , that &apos;s good news .
shouldn &apos;t we go up to the squad room ?
we can &apos;t , jane .
why not ?
cavanaugh can &apos;t know about this .
calvin ghetts investigated the fire that killed his family .
what does cal have to do with paddy doyle ?
we were about to make a deal with ghetts
to testify against him .
cal was dirty ?
oh , my god .
wait a minute . did paddy send someone
to atlantic city to take him out before he could talk ?
we think so .
the fbi thinks paddy paid ghetts
to burn down buildings in the &apos; 90s ,
falsify arson reports
so paddy could buy condemned property for a song .
but you could never prove that .
no , not until calvin ghetts told me in a phone call
before he died that he had saved evidence
that could prove that paddy was behind that fire .
cal set the fire ...
and you were granting him immunity
in exchange for the evidence in his testimony .
right .
you were gonna make a deal with a man
who killed a police officer &apos;s wife and baby ?
maura , sometimes you got to dance with the devil
to get a conviction --
especially for two capital murders .
so you &apos;re gonna seek the death penalty .
if you &apos;re conflicted , doctor ,
i won &apos;t ask you to help investigate this .
i &apos;m a physician , mr. king . i don &apos;t wish death on anyone .
that doesn &apos;t mean i won &apos;t help you .
wait a minute . help you with what ?
you don &apos;t have a case without cal ghetts .
i don &apos;t have any more time .
i need you to find that evidence .
what are we looking for ?
i don &apos;t know .
all right ? all we have are cal &apos;s arson files .
maybe there &apos;s something there .
yeah , but what ?
you had 20 years and your own task force
to make an arson connection
between cal ghetts and paddy doyle .
now you want us to find something in 36 hours ?
i &apos;m not gonna lie to you -- it &apos;s a hail mary pass .
well , you better hope we can catch .
these are the last two .
i don &apos;t think they &apos;ll be any help .
they &apos;re from 2004 .
we &apos;ve been through everything from 1993 .
his file on cavanaugh &apos;s apartment fire isn &apos;t in here .
i keep telling &apos; em it &apos;s time to scan everything .
did anyone talk to cal &apos;s wife yet ?
no .
oh , man , i really should go over there
and give her my condolences .
hey , frost , go now .
well , it &apos;s late .
no , but we &apos;re running out of time ,
and cal might have kept the file at home .
well , you better come with me .
it &apos;d be good to have a woman there --
make her feel more comfortable .
well , i want to go through &apos; 92 and &apos; 94 .
the case might be misfiled .
i can go .
but you &apos;re not a detective .
well , i &apos;m a woman who makes people feel comfortable ,
and you &apos;re busy , jane .
we &apos;ll say we &apos;re there to bring her the collection money .
we &apos;ve got a lot to do here , jane .
okay . okay , yeah , yeah , do it .
do you know what time it is ?
miss ghetts ?
barold ?
i &apos;m sorry to bother you .
i just wanted to come by and say ...
i &apos;m very sorry for you loss .
detective ghetts was a good man .
this is from everyone at the station .
thank you . that &apos;s very kind .
this is my colleague , dr . isles .
we &apos;re all very sorry for your loss .
we know how difficult it must be .
miss ghetts , we were closing
some of cal &apos;s open arson cases ,
and we haven &apos;t been able to find some of his files .
we were wondering if perhaps he brought his work home .
he kept his files in the garage , yes ,
but it got broken into when we were ...
when we were in atlantic city .
i know this is an imposition ,
but would it be possible for you to show us the garage ?
it &apos;s just cal &apos;s junk and old files .
they really tore the place apart .
too bad they didn &apos;t take that hunk of junk .
calvin said this was our big retirement nest egg .
&quot; shirley , no matter what happens ,
don &apos;t you ever sell the granada . &quot;
you wouldn &apos;t get more than $ 500 for it .
oh , you might get more than that .
no , she &apos;s right . i looked it up on &quot; car buyers . &quot;
but your husband said it was your nest egg ?
every time we had a cash @-@ flow issue
he &apos;d tell me ... not to worry .
&quot; it &apos;s all right here , honey . &quot;
i &apos;m sorry .
this is just too hard right now .
excuse me .
paddy &apos;s guys tore this place apart .
but they left the car .
can you check in the glove compartment ?
sure .
nothing in the trunk .
yeah , nothing in the glove compartment or inside the car .
if old cal hid something in the car ,
paddy &apos;s guys would have found it .
yeah , but this car hasn &apos;t been moved in years .
and there &apos;s plenty of places to hide things ,
especially if the car doesn &apos;t need to be driven .
i &apos;m thinking like a drug dealer .
well , don &apos;t you think paddy &apos;s guys think like drug dealers ?
it &apos;s worth a try .
uh , i &apos;ll get a search warrant going .
we &apos;ll take all this and we &apos;ll do what paddy &apos;s guys couldn &apos;t do --
pull this car apart .
it &apos;s jane . she wants to know if we have anything .
not until we have the search warrant .
go get some food . i &apos;ll stay here .
you sure ?
yeah , yeah , i already ate .
i am craving a tempeh bacon burger .
make sure jane eats something , too .
you know she forgets sometimes .
i feel guilty .
you have to eat .
we &apos;ll get it to go .
to paddy !
look at him -- he thinks he &apos;s already gotten away with it .
he &apos;s killed four people in the last two days .
let &apos;s go , maura .
you know , they &apos;ve even changed the menu for him .
they &apos;re serving him beef with french fries .
maybe it &apos;s locally sourced .
let &apos;s go . this is not helping anything .
maura .
three more men are lying on my autopsy tables because of you .
maura , i had nothing to do with that crash .
i wish jane had killed you .
hi . how is she ?
not good .
does she know i &apos;m here ?
she asked me to call you .
hey , maura ?
hope &apos;s here .
just in the middle of getting the pills out of my cashmere blends .
maura ...
i told him i wished he was dead .
no , i -- i don &apos;t really like to be hugged when i &apos;m very upset .
got to get these sheath dresses off the floor before they wrinkle .
yes , it is strange getting to know her as an adult .
i can &apos;t even imagine .
every year on her birthday , i would come to boston ,
and i &apos;d visit her grave .
and i would add up the years , and i would think about ...
how old she &apos;d be and wonder what she &apos;d turn out to be .
well , is she anything like you imagined ?
she &apos;s better .
she &apos;s so much better than i imagined ,
and i have a good imagination .
i &apos;m so sorry .
i should have offered you some tea .
and girl scout cookies .
i ate them all .
even the thin mints ?
i ate those first .
damn .
i know this is your house , but could i make you some tea ?
i would like that .
sometimes ... the only way for me to turn off
the panicky thoughts in my head at night
is the thought of espresso in the morning .
me too .
would you like some ?
oh , no , that &apos;ll keep me up all night .
thank you .
what can i do ?
go back 37 years and sleep with a different man ?
well , can we give you a hug now ?
it won &apos;t help .
can we try ?
thank you .
how &apos;s she doing ?
she &apos;s okay .
she &apos;d be a lot better
if we could find something in cal &apos;s granada .
any news on the car ?
csru took apart the doors ,
the engine , the dashboard .
nothing so far .
where else would cal hide that file ?
maybe we don &apos;t have to find the file .
if cal set the fire , paddy would &apos;ve paid him to do it .
which means paddy would
have kept a record of it in his little book .
yeah . here .
here , everybody take a section .
paddy wrote everything in code .
&quot; big head rent lo broad &quot; ?
&quot; big head &quot; meant michael wynne .
&quot; rent &quot; meant shaking down store owners on &quot; lo broad , &quot;
which is the lower end of west broadway .
how do i explain my presence if lieutenant cavanaugh comes in ?
tell him you have menstrual cramps .
that does make any sense .
oh , yes , it does .
he won &apos;t ask any questions once he hears those words .
shirley ghetts just called .
someone want to tell me
why we have cal &apos;s car in the evidence garage ?
oh , boy .
see you in my office , vince ?
he &apos;s been in there a long time .
just try not to think about it .
we got to find a connection between paddy and cal .
what &apos;d he say ?
he said it &apos;s too bad cal &apos;s dead .
he &apos;d like to wrap his hands around his throat .
frost , what are you doing ?
trying to break paddy &apos;s codes .
he &apos;s got these charts starting in 1992 .
show me where that is .
it &apos;s right here in paddy &apos;s book .
oh , my god .
whoa , what &apos;s wrong ?
how could we not know ? paddy and oso -- that &apos;s it .
who &apos;s oso ? - oso garcia --
he was a colombian drug dealer that cavanaugh shut down in &apos; 92 .
when paddy was cavanaugh &apos;s c.i. ?
yeah .
&apos;92 ? that doesn &apos;t make any sense .
yeah , why would paddy buy cocaine from oso ,
then turn around and help cavanaugh bust him ?
oh , my god .
what is it ?
it was a setup from the beginning to the end .
all paddy wanted was cheaper cocaine ,
and he fed cavanaugh information
knowing that it would chase the colombians out of southie .
paddy ran southie .
eventually , the colombians would have to go to him for help .
they didn &apos;t know paddy was the informant .
i &apos;m not following this .
paddy helped the drug unit bring heat onto oso
from august of &apos; 92 to march of &apos; 93 .
oh , so all these zeroes mean paddy couldn &apos;t buy cocaine .
because cavanaugh was putting pressure on the colombians .
right , but in april of &apos; 93,
paddy started buying cocaine again but for half the price .
so what changed in march of &apos; 93 ?
his family died .
linda and christopher cavanaugh
died in the fire at the end of march .
my guess is , paddy &apos;s plan was to kill cavanaugh ,
but it worked out the same when cal set that fire ,
only his wife and son died instead .
&apos;cause cavanaugh fell apart ...
he never ran another drug case .
does cavanaugh still have a copy of paddy &apos;s book ?
i just saw him leave .
oh , my god . we got to find him .
he &apos;s gonna kill paddy .
can i buy you a drink , sean ?
yeah .
whoa ! hey ! boston police ! knock it off !
hey , stop it !
no , no ! come on !
back off ! back off .
back off .
i &apos;m gonna kill him .
try not to move , lieutenant .
how could you ? !
he came at me . i was minding my own business .
oh , shut up ! come on , let &apos;s get him up .
i &apos;ll get him out of here . let me take him .
come on , sean .
let me -- let me take you .
he killed my family .
he killed my family .
i still think we need to get him to a hospital .
he needs stitches and his nose reset .
no hospital .
i agree . let &apos;s not make this worse with a paper trail .
you reset my nose . you can do that .
can you stitch him up , too ?
okay , get me some towels and my medical bag .
okay ..
let &apos;s put him on the couch .
i don &apos;t want to get any blood on it .
no , no , it &apos;s okay .
as soon as we can move him , i &apos;ll take him to my place .
no , i &apos;m fine .
no , you &apos;re not .
and if you think i &apos;m gonna
let you try and kill paddy again , think again .
he &apos;s a dead man !
lieutenant , if anyone deserves to kill him , it &apos;s you .
but you can &apos;t .
think about what you had to go through
to survive linda and christopher &apos;s death .
every day that you force yourself to go on living
is a tribute to those two people that loved you .
i blamed myself .
all this time , i thought that fire was an accident .
i was right to blame myself . it &apos;s my fault that they died .
don &apos;t say that .
linda and the baby weren &apos;t supposed to be there , vince .
he wanted me , but i was working ! i was always working !
so , instead , he killed them .
get out of my way !
no .
he &apos;s not spending another day on earth !
lieutenant , there &apos;s another way .
we keep digging ,
we prove that paddy paid ghetts to set the fire ,
paddy gets charged with arson , and he gets the death penalty .
you gonna move ?
no !
well , what are you gonna do , vince ?
you gonna shoot me ? &apos; cause that &apos;s what it &apos;s gonna take .
oh , what the hell ?
i heard you say there was another way .
it &apos;s all i could think of .
all she needs to do is check his vitals
and administer the sedative every four hours .
well , what &apos;d you tell her ?
that he &apos;s a police officer who lost his family ,
and we &apos;re looking for the suspect .
that &apos;s all she needs to know .
thank you .
thank you so much for coming .
what do you need me to do ?
he &apos;s stable .
i gave him 4 milligrams of lorazepam 15 minutes ago ,
and there &apos;s more in my kit .
all right . i &apos;ll administer another dose in a few hours .
he &apos;ll be fine . go .
thank you .
we can &apos;t keep him on lorazepam for too long .
well , i &apos;d rather keep him drugged up
than visit him in walpole .
yes , but i &apos;m concerned about the addiction properties .
now you &apos;re concerned ?
korsak , what &apos;s that look like in cal &apos;s garage ?
looks like a welding setup .
let me see .
mm , maybe csru missed something .
do you see any signs of welding ?
no .
i do .
it has an o.e.m. muffler ,
but there &apos;s a non @-@ factory weld on it .
do you want tin snips ?
uh , no , give me the sawzall .
thanks .
yeah , i &apos;ve found something .
give me that monkey wrench .
thanks .
and ?
and ...
well , shirley ghetts said it was their nest egg .
she sure did . this looks promising .
clever .
it looks like two pieces of pipe and a union joint .
that &apos;s a gas valve .
it looks like we found cal &apos;s evidence .
it &apos;s a lot better than a missing file .
and these might be pieces from the furnace
that exploded in cavanaugh &apos;s apartment .
he put the arson photos in here .
1245 silver street .
that was cavanaugh &apos;s apartment .
frost isn &apos;t back yet ?
give him a break .
his father &apos;s an admiral , not a plumber .
well , did he say that he found anything else in the car ?
he said he thought that the exhaust system had been welded shut .
this is the gas valve from the exploded furnace .
if it had malfunctioned , there would be evidence of charring ,
there isn &apos;t any .
so the gas valve wasn &apos;t the cause of the fire ,
like cal originally claimed .
no .
and it wasn &apos;t the union joint .
no , there &apos;s no damage on the threads .
which means it was loosened on purpose ,
which supports the theory that cal set the fire .
he probably went into cavanaugh &apos;s apartment ,
turned off the heat , then went down into the basement
and loosened the union joint .
natural gas from these pipes
would have filled the basement in minutes .
linda came home to a freezing house , turned the heat on .
you know , a fire investigator once told me ,
if you smell gas , don &apos;t even touch the doorbell .
the electrical spark from that doorbell
is enough to blow the entire place up .
and we still haven &apos;t connected the fire to paddy doyle .
got something .
this was stuffed way up in the exhaust pipe .
it &apos;s cal &apos;s investigative notes from march 22 , 1993 --
that &apos;s the day of the fire .
what do they say ?
&quot; there was a witness -- a neighbor , mrs. longstead &quot; ?
she saw cal ?
i don &apos;t think it was cal .
&quot; francine longstead of 1299 winston street reports
she saw a white male enter the basement right before the fire . &quot;
a white male ? cal was black .
&quot; white male &quot; rules out the colombians , too .
&quot; mrs. longstead says she heard the explosion
&quot; and looked out her window in time to see the same man
running from the basement with his shirt on fire . &quot;
if his shirt was on fire and he was running ,
it &apos;s highly likely that
he suffered second- and third @-@ degree burns .
so we just need mrs. longstead to make a description .
francine longstead died in 2005 .
paddy had nine trusted lieutenants .
one of those guys torched that apartment .
i &apos;m calling up surveillance photos
of paddy and his top guys from march 1993 .
they always met behind the chauncy street tavern .
that &apos;s jackie donovan . we can rule him out .
i didn &apos;t see any burn scars when i did his autopsy .
frost , see if there &apos;s a photo of them all together
march 23 , 1993 .
the day after the fire ?
you think they took surveillance photos of him every day ?
there &apos;s thousands of megs of high @-@ res photos here .
you know , every time paddy wanted something done ,
one of these guys did it , but this time was different .
what do you mean ?
rico -- paddy &apos;s not gonna send
one of his guys to kill a cop &apos;s family .
i got it -- march 23 , 1993 .
he &apos;s gonna do it himself .
of course .
penalty &apos;s the same for capital murder .
do it yourself , no one can turn on you .
detective frost , can you blow up the area around his collar ?
maura , we knew paddy was behind linda and christopher &apos;s murders .
that fact that he set the fire himself
isn &apos;t any worse than ordering someone else to do it .
what is it ?
hemostatic trauma gauze .
i think she helped him .
maura , he &apos;s fine .
his vitals are stable .
what &apos;s wrong ?
that &apos;s your work , isn &apos;t it ?
did paddy tell you how he got those burns ?
no .
you see the man on the couch ?
20 years ago ,
paddy killed his 25 @-@ year @-@ old wife and their 2 @-@ year @-@ old son .
they burned to death after he blew up their apartment ,
and you -- you treated his burns , didn &apos;t you ?
i didn &apos;t know .
i swear to you i did not know how he got those burns .
but you must have heard .
you must have heard that a cop &apos;s family died in a fire ,
and then paddy shows up with third @-@ degree burns and --
come on ! what lie did you tell yourself that day ? !
he swore that he would never hurt women and children ,
so that -- it must have been an accident .
no , it wasn &apos;t an accident .
there are no more accidents , hope .
you made a bargain with the devil , and it has come due .
what do you mean ?
you &apos;re going to testify against him .
i am beyond impressed that you caught
the wildest hail mary pass that i ever had to throw .
thank you both .
well , it &apos;s not over yet .
hope martin still has to testify .
what if she doesn &apos;t ?
well , that &apos;s why i sent two cops to escort her .
she &apos;ll be here .
i &apos;ll talk to the judge .
we &apos;ll get in front of the grand jury ,
and we &apos;ll have two murder indictments by lunch .
i think you better wish me luck this time .
don &apos;t screw it up , counselor .
you okay ?
you know when i said she should &apos;ve picked
someone else to sleep with 37 years ago ?
yeah .
maybe paddy should &apos;ve picked somebody else .
well , she said she &apos;d testify against him , right ?
yes .
well , maybe , you know , in her own way ,
she &apos;s trying to make amends .
here we go .
now go get &apos; em .
how you doing , jenkins ? you got a lot of evidence today .
got a gun case on the third floor .
good luck with that , okay ?
thanks .
cavanaugh should be here .
lieutenant cavanaugh ? he &apos;s already upstairs .
he &apos;s what ?
jane , he &apos;s not gonna strangle paddy in the court house .
he can &apos;t get his weapon through security .
yes , he can .
look at me , you son of a bitch .
blowin &apos; your head off would be too good .
i &apos;m gonna kill you slowly .
it wasn &apos;t personal , sean . it was just business .
business ?
you killed my wife and my baby son
so you could get your cocaine cheaper ? !
how do you stand there and think you deserve another breath ?
sean , don &apos;t !
lieutenant , please don &apos;t do this .
don &apos;t . i want to talk to my father .
don &apos;t come any closer , dr. isles . he &apos;s a dead man .
all right , but before you kill him ,
i just want him to know something .
she &apos;s here , paddy -- hope .
hope is here ?
she was about to testify to the grand jury .
that &apos;ll never happen .
now it won &apos;t because the lieutenant is gonna save us all
a lot of anguish ,
but it must feel terrible
to hear that the love of your life
was about to help us put you on death row .
she wouldn &apos;t .
oh , but she would .
all these years , you &apos;ve stayed alive for two things --
power and hope .
seems fitting you &apos;d go out like this .
you &apos;re lying .
hope would never do that .
i &apos;ve got a better way for you to experience hell .
you &apos;re gonna stay alive ,
but without her .
come on , sean .
give me minute , vince .
you know , i never thought i &apos;d say this ,
but these sweet @-@ potato fries are growing on me .
try them with a fresh mint .
don &apos;t push your luck .
speaking of luck @-@ pushing ,
he totally could have pulled that trigger .
no , he wasn &apos;t going to .
you don &apos;t know that .
yes , i do .
oh , really ? oh , okay , show me that study .
cite statistics with your double @-@ blind control group .
what are you doing ?
looking up the peer @-@ reviewed studies
on violence in men &apos;s rooms .
you &apos;re so full of crap .
you &apos;re shoe shopping , m-- stop eating my fries .
give me my tablet .
no .
order dessert , and i &apos;ll think about it .
mmm , these are really good with the fresh mint .
enough with the plants already .
