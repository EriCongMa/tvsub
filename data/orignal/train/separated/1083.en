Pink Panthers-- most dangerous gang of thieves in the world.
Neal plans to infiltrate the gang.
I want a contract.
Pink Panthers for my freedom.
It has to be ironclad.
You deserve to.
So Woodford wants us to break into this company
called Atlas Tech.
Inside that vault is a digital file named "Exodus."
What's in the file?
Looks more like a complex algorithm to me.
It draws lines between variables,
connecting them in a seemingly arbitrary manner.
International airports, international airlines.
So whatever they're transporting
is going in and out of the country.
It's almost an impossible heist.
Unless you have the algorithm.
It looks like the Pink Panthers have disappeared.
There's been no word for days.
I've heard nothing from Luc.
What about Keller?
Nothing.
It's too quiet.
Any chance the Panthers are onto you?
Maybe Keller said something.
If they were onto me,
I'd be getting a lot worse than the silent treatment.
Where were you this morning?
Home.
Came from a different direction.
Okay, I see what's going on here.
Oh, really? Enlighten me.
You're having separation anxiety.
It's totally natural.
No, we're never separated enough for me to be anxious about it.
But without my anklet,
you can't track my every movement,
and it's driving you crazy.
I'll admit, I sleep better
when that dot tells me
exactly where you are.
I hear lavender's good for sleep.
I'll adjust.
Maybe a sound machine.
Let the crash of waves wash away your anxiety.
How about you worry more about the Panthers
and less about my REM cycles.
If we don't take these guys down--
What are you not telling me?
I pushed for the Panthers' case.
I turned down F.B.I resources
and guaranteed that we could take them down on our own.
I have to deliver.
What happens if you don't?
Mm, something along the lines of an early-retirement package
and a box for my mugs.
Where are we?
We fed the algorithm from the Exodus file into the computer
and accessed the randomizer.
What did you get?
We don't know yet.
We're working on decoding the data, but it takes time.
Well, we know the Panthers are targeting something
that's arriving at an airport.
That could be anything.
On a daily basis, you got everything
from jewels to currency
to valuable documents going in and out of airports.
So we don't know what it is, when it's happening,
or at which airport.
We do know the Panthers have gone underground.
I could try to draw them out.
Nah, it's too risky.
Keep working on the algorithm.
It's our best shot at figuring out what they're up to.
I got them the stamp and the Exodus file.
It doesn't make sense for the Panthers to be shutting me out.
Well, I've been told separation anxiety's completely natural.
Panthers?
No, it's just Mozzie.
十万火急
You're late.
Late for what?
What are you wearing?
I received an anonymous message
at one of my drop sites this morning--
Just a time, 10:23 a.m.,
and a place,Brooklyn Promenade.
You think the message is from the Pink Panthers?
They're preparing for the big score.
Naturally they want the best of the best.
I think they're wooing me.
I don't think they know who you are.
Can you blame them?
You take every precaution to stay unknown.
But you've told them about my extensive contributions,
haven't you?
You haven't.
It's complicated.
The stamp, the Exodus file,
none of that would have happened without my expertise.
I know, and you know how much I appreciate it.
Uh, not enough to mention me to your new friends.
The Panthers aren't my friends,
and they're not the gentlemen thieves they used to be.
They're dangerous.
I have a lot riding on this mission.
I'm not even sure about my own position in the group.
I haven't been contacted in days.
It's not the time to be suggesting new recruits.
Moz.
You're right.
Thank you for understanding.
No, no, not about that.
You should have told the Panthers about me.
But you're right.
The message wasn't from them.
Who's it from?
It occurs to me now there's something
I may have failed to mention.
Who am I looking for?
Aubergine frock, reading a book.
Who is that?
Moz, who is she?
She's my wife.
Wait, you have a wife?
Yes, technically I am United in matrimony.
In the traditional sense?
Yes.
We were married by a justice of the peace--
a real one.
Haven't seen her in five years, since the honeymoon.
You never even mentioned her.
I never found quite the right time.
Wait. You said five years?
Yes, I was at a low point.
Me too, as I recall. I was in prison.
And I was out a best friend and a partner in crime.
Did you know that 20% of people
meet their spouse at work?
So you met your wife on a con?
I was posing as a Finnish baron.
Opening night of Il Trovatore at the Met.
My suit was tailored,
my cover was impeccable,
but my heart wasn't in it...
Until I saw her.
Her name was Eva Perkins,
a young widow, the inheritor of a sizable fortune--
Lonely, wealthy,
a perfect mark for my sweetheart con.
We had a whirlwind romance.
After only a few days together, we rushed to the altar.
The con was going perfectly,
and then the real truth came out.
We discovered we were both pulling a sweetheart con
on each other.
But we had both successfully conned
an expert con artist,
and that could be worth a fortune.
So we pooled our resources
and went on a honeymoon con to Morocco.
I know this doesn't end with
"and they lived happily ever after."
No, our fairy-tale ending
was more in the traditional German oeuvre.
Tragedy, betrayal,
diminutive men led astray by a cunning vixen.
Precisely.
She stole my half of the score
and abandoned me in a Marrakech train station.
That was the last you saw of her?
Yeah. I always knew that she would return...
Groveling, wanting me back.
Five years is a long time to wait to grovel.
Yeah, I should go it alone from here.
If I'm gonna break her heart,
I'm gentleman enough to do it privately.
Of course.
Let her down easy, Moz.
I should have known by the appointed time--
10:23.
October 23rd--
The anniversary of our very first con together.
Dr. and Mrs. Coleridge.
It's very good to see you again...
Dr. Coleridge.
I always did like this necklace.
You're out of practice.
But you're not.
I'm surprised you still have it.
I wanted something to remember you by.
My half of the Moroccan silver wasn't enough?
Something sentimental.
You are not the sentimental type.
I'm not here to rehash the past.
I want to talk about the future.
I'd be lying if I said I was surprised.
You were expecting this?
Of course.
You have to remember, Eva, people like you and me--
We're solitary hunters.
We're like the African civet.
Our musk is alluring, but we're meant to prowl alone.
Mozzie, I want a divorce.
She's getting remarried. Can you believe it?
That's not what I'm having a hard time wrapping my mind around.
Did you know he was married?
I was in jail when this happened.
I was told to come home so I could have lunch with my wife.
I'm here.
Yeah, and here's lunch.
Honey, will you get the plates?
She was talking to me.
Oh, but I know where the plates are.
Since when?
He moved them before you got here.
He creates chaos to cope with change.
Oh, and your spices are now next to the sink.
You all know I'm not a meddler,
but Eva has left me no choice.
Moz, I know this isn't easy,
but if she's in love with somebody else,
You got to let her go.
Oh, is that your consensus, that she's really in love?
Maybe I'm old-fashioned,
but I do believe that's why people get married.
Has my very existence not opened your eyes
to a more complex world?
You really think she's conning this guy?
Of course.
It's what she does-- quite excellently--
And what you do with...
some skill is stop that from happening.
You want me to investigate your wife?
I want you to stop Eva from hurting another innocent victim.
Are you sure this isn't about her last innocent victim?
I swear my motives are pure.
I-I've been doing some research.
Her mark is named Jack Conroy,
President of a charity for at-risk youth.
Well, it is a bit hard to believe that a con artist
marrying the head of a charity is just a coincidence.
Exactly.
The target is so obvious, it's beneath her.
Honey, do it for the kids.
All right.
I will look into it,
but you have to promise me that you'll stay out of it,
and you won't do anything stupid.
Absolutely.
Oh, good. You're here.
Why am I standing in the lobby of Jack Conroy's charity?
I promised Peter we'd stay out of it.
Technically, you didn't promise.
I did, and the suit and I
have our own understanding about truth.
I'm leaving.
No, no, you can't.
A man of Henry Statton's stature requires a boy Friday.
Who's Henry Statton?
Mr. Statton, Mr. Conroy can see you now.
I hear you're interested in making a donation to our worthy cause.
Considering it, but I don't want to rush into anything.
Yes, Mr. Statton is well aware of how risky it can be
to let emotions cloud his better judgment.
Of course, we want all our donors to be well-informed.
It's important to be aware of what
or, uh, whom I'm committing to.
Sometimes an outsider's expertise is needed.
Like good friends,
to let us know when we're doing something stupid.
I used to be a lot like you, Mr. Statton--
Fancy cars I never had time to drive,
wondering if all my hard work would ever make a difference.
And then one day everything changed.
I was the, uh, victim of an armed robbery,
and being the coward that I am, I ran.
The shooter got me in the leg.
And I realized the fear I felt in that moment
is what so many kids face every day.
I mean, they--they live in war zones.
And after this, I...
I felt a call to fight with them.
There is still one, uh, serious concern...
Your fiancee.
We haven't announced our engagement.
Oh, Henry's very thorough.
Her name is Eva Perkins...
size seven shoe, Libra, allergic to peanuts.
Okay.
And one other thing...
She's a con woman.
That's what you were gonna say, isn't it?
Yes, we're concerned that Eva might be using you
to get to the charity's money.
Yes, I know about her past, and you're wrong.
Eva is different now.
Well, in my experience, once a con, always a con.
Well, if I didn't think people could change,
I couldn't do this work.
And it's that belief that makes you a good mark.
I'm not naive, gentlemen.
I know that charities are a ripe target.
That's why our accounts are protected.
Not even I have access to them.
Eva would find a way.
She has bested some of the best.
It's part of her magnetism.
It sounds like you've had the pleasure of meeting her.
No, no.
That's just conjecture based on extensive research.
Well, then we should fix that.
We're hosting a gala tomorrow night.
Come and see what we're about,
and once you meet Eva, I'm sure you'll love her.
She's even better than I remember.
Of course, if you're gonna con a guy with a savior complex,
convince him that you need to be saved.
It's genius.
I don't believe it.
She's got you fooled too?
Oh, I'm not fooled. I'm concerned.
As am I. Jack is clearly in too deep.
For you.
You're thinking with your heart instead of your head.
I'm not. I know Eva.
No, you knew her, Moz.
That was five years ago.
Oh, people don't change.
Look at you. You went to prison.
You got out and went right back to the same game.
We are who we are.
And even we can be blinded by love.
You know I've learned that one the hard way.
And who had your back all those times?
You did, and I have yours now.
If this is about saving a charity, I'm in.
But if it's just about Eva, you should walk away.
Trust me.
I require wisdom from the nectar of the gods.
You got it. First pour's on me.
Some journeys need to be walked alone.
You are not what I pictured when Eva told me about her ex.
Got to say, Mozzie,
her new partner's definitely an upgrade.
I knew it. Eva hasn't changed.
She's not in love. She's still a con artist.
Eva has moved on.
I strongly suggest you do the same.
People can get really hurt if they refuse to let go.
You can't threaten me.
Blather all you want. Who's gonna believe you?
You're a conspiracy nut and a criminal.
Look, face it-- in a game of you against me,
guys like me win every time.
Guys like you, no one even pays attention.
I was right-- mostly.
I never should have let you drink alone.
What happened?
I was attacked by Jack Conroy.
He and Eva are in on it together.
No, no, no, no,
I think you've had enough nectar of the gods for one night.
I've never been of clearer mind.
I should have seen it from the beginning.
He was just too perfect,
with that fake limp and that real hair.
If Jack and Eva are working together,
why would he come clean to you?
I don't know.
Must I have all the answers?
Isn't my bloodshed enough?
You shed blood?
I can see that you've suffered.
He hit me exactly where he knew you couldn't see it,
like he does it for a living.
Then maybe you should leave this alone.
No cost is too high for justice.
You said you had my back.
All right, I'll talk to Peter tomorrow.
In the meantime, no more altercations,
really this time.
My wound needs a salve.
I'm getting you a band-aid.
What's going on?
We got the airport data off the randomizer.
It gave us the initials SFO.
San Francisco International.
They stole the algorithm, now they've gone quiet.
This could be the big score.
Except it's going down this afternoon.
The randomizer gave us the airline and the flight number.
The plane arrives today at 2:30 p.m. Pacific time.
There's another number, but we can't figure out what it is.
It could be some kind of code to the shipment.
Woodford cut me out.
You think Keller told him?
You're the new guy.
Maybe they don't quite trust you yet.
All that matters now is stopping them.
Well, unless we can get our hands on a G6,
there's no way to get there in time.
All right, I'm putting the San Francisco Bureau on it.
Get me their ASAC now.
This whole mission depends on catching these guys in the act.
I'm gonna make sure that happens.
ASAC Rollins. Agent Burke.
What?
No, I need to speak with ASAC Rollins.
While you're on hold,
there's another matter that could use our help.
Let me guess.
Mozzie had a run-in with Eva's fiance.
Of course he did. I told you two to stay out of it.
He attacked Mozzie after they met.
He attacked him?
Mozzie claims he was beaten.
Mozzie also claims the government
uses fluoride to control my mind.
You said you would look into the situation.
Transferred to Seattle? Why--
I need to speak to whoever is in charge right now.
So you looked into Jack and Eva?
They're clean, as far as I can tell.
And the charity?
Seems legit.
And the accounts are secure.
So, even if they were pulling a con,
there's no way to access the funds.
From my experience, whenever someone says,
"there's no way this is a con..."
It's usually a con.
This is Special Agent Burke.
I'm the ASAC of the New York White Collar Division.
My team and I are chasing the Pink Panthers.
We have intel that they're targeting a plane
coming into San Francisco at 2:30.
Yes, today.
Make sure he knows the Panthers
can sniff out feds from a mile away.
I don't have to tell you the Panthers
are the best in the world.
You'll need your top team on this.
Great. My office will fill you in on the rest.
You'll know everything we know.
Get everything we have on the Panthers
and coordinate with San Francisco.
We're compiling it now.
Should have it in the next couple of minutes.
I want updates on this every half hour until it's over.
Got it.
We'll go crazy if we sit here and watch the clock.
We're back to Mozzie again?
Well, he did help you find me and bring down Boothe.
That earns him a few minutes of government service.
What do you have in mind?
This is not what I had in mind when you said "stakeout."
We can turn on the game if you want.
There's no game.
No. It's my car.
They're here.
The image of that is just extraordinary.
Here, you have to capture the moment of truth.
I'm pretty sure the only thing I'm gonna capture
are two people splitting an order of calamari.
I've been thinking...
Shh. They're talking.
Oh, if he shushes me one more time in my car--
I want to announce our engagement tonight at the gala.
I want the whole world to know how lucky I am to have you.
Oh, I would love that.
And I love you.
Oh, they're good.
Well, looks pretty convincing to me.
Oh, but, you know, it's complicated.
Because of Mozzie?
I should have mentioned this earlier.
I ran into him yesterday.
How did you run into Mozzie?
Oh, here it is. He's gonna come clean.
Here you go.
He came to me with some wild theories about you and me.
Oh, I should have known when I asked him for a divorce
he would do something crazy.
He's probably intimidated by you.
Poor thing.
Poor thing?
I'm the victim.
I just feel bad for him.
Don't you dare feel bad for me.
Okay, I'm calling it off.
Wait. Hold on. Hold on.
If this were my con, I'd be doing the same thing.
You never drop the act in public in case someone's listening.
He's right.
They're never gonna drop the act until I make them.
Mozzie, do not leave this car.
Where are you going?
Get back in here.
I would not recommend that.
Mozzie, what are you doing here?
I've decided to sign the divorce papers.
As you know, I am a reasonable man.
You didn't have to attack me so viciously.
What's he talking about?
I have no idea.
I thought we had a nice conversation.
Well, it was honest.
I'll give you that.
I just know you two are planning something.
Mozzie, I know that you like to create stories
to deal with things that you don't understand,
but you can't just make wild accusations.
What Jack and I have is real.
Uh, what you have is as real as his limp,
and you leave me no choice but to prove it.
Mozzie!
I have had enough.
Okay, should we go get him?
No, I think he needs to see this through.
Satisfied?
Well, that doesn't prove anything.
Anyone can fake a scar.
Mozzie, stop it!
Mozzie, stop, please.
Haven't you embarrassed yourself enough?
Let's go.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I'm okay.
I will be vindicated.
I don't think this is what Mozzie meant
when he said "moment of truth."
I think it is.
I think Mozzie could be right.
El's keeping an eye on Mozzie
until we figure out what's going on.
What is going on?
I'm not sure yet, but I got a hunch.
I've uploaded the photos.
Based on the angle of the entry,
it looks like the bullet hit only muscle,
no tendons, no ligaments.
No permanent damage.
Which means no limp.
A shot like that, it's pretty lucky.
Yeah, especially if Jack was running away,
which is what he claims.
If he was running and the shooter was standing up,
the bullet would have entered at a down angle.
Yeah, and this shot looks straight across.
A clean shot, no permanent damage.
I think he did it himself.
He's creating a story.
Rich guy gets shot.
His life flashes before his eyes.
He dedicates that life to others.
Yeah, nothing like a come-to-Jesus moment
to get people to trust you with their money.
Except it isn't about the money.
The charity's accounts are secure.
So what's their angle?
I just got off the phone with San Francisco.
All teams are ready and waiting at the airport.
Flight should be arriving in a little more over an hour.
Just stay on the phone with these guys
and keep me updated.
This could all be over in a few hours.
Yep, here we are, just twiddling our thumbs.
If it would get you to San Francisco,
would you shoot yourself in the leg?
What are you talking about?
What if Jack's con is about location?
He could be using the charity to gain access.
Look, they're hosting a gala
this afternoon at a private gallery.
Filled with artwork worth millions of dollars.
So they're not trying to rip off the charity.
They're trying to get close to something they want to steal.
If this is really their angle,
then Eva is as good as Mozzie says.
I get what he saw in her.
Get me an inventory of the artwork at this gallery.
Let's go tell Mozzie he was right.
No.
You can do it. Come on.
I should have known.
Love is the ultimate con.
Just because it ended doesn't mean it wasn't real.
No. John Lennon was right.
Reality leaves a lot to the imagination.
His mythos had clearly been affected by Paul's death.
Look, I know you cared about her a lot,
but you said it yourself.
I mean, she stole your half of the score in Morocco
and then took off on your honeymoon.
What could be better than that?
It was a brilliant play.
Don't you want to be with somebody you can trust?
Trust is an illusory crutch
required by those who take comfort in false certainty.
People like Eva and I-- we live for the game.
So you thought she'd just come back and pick up the game
where it was left off?
Only this time
I would be the one who took off with her half of the score.
Look, she's made her choice.
There's no accounting for taste.
Moz, there's gonna be other Evas out there.
I find my truest self in solitude.
I'm a loner by nature.
And I have my bees.
You have us.
Eva's free to do whatever she wants.
I'm done for good.
The last chapter of our epic tale
has been penned and sealed with vermillion wax.
Hello.
It's, uh, Neal.
What do you want?
I'm in trouble.
I-I'm tempted to say something about dogs and fleas,
but you may have heard it before.
I know I made a mistake.
I should have never partnered with Jack.
I didn't realize how good I had it before.
You've miscalculated if you think flattery
is my weakness anymore.
You know how dangerous Jack can be.
I need your help.
I wouldn't have called you if I had any other option.
Meet me at the gala...
Please.
Hey. Where's Mozzie?
We've been calling him on his phone,
but he's not answering.
He was just here.
He said you were calling, and he stepped outside.
Mozzie?
Moz.
Who do you think called him?
Eva.
Mysterious phone call, he disappears.
She lured him somewhere.
Well, it has to be the gala.
It's about to start.
Jack and Eva went through a lot of hard work
to set up the perfect plan.
It seems like Mozzie would be getting in the way.
No, you're right.
They have a perfect plan,
perfect covers they've developed for years.
Yeah, they're not gonna want to burn those covers just yet.
So they need a fall guy.
Mozzie walked right into a trap.
I'm here to rescue my wife. You can't stop me.
You were right.
That's absurd. I'm not the fall guy.
Eva knows I'm not foolish enough to walk into a trap.
Everyone has a weakness, and Eva knows yours.
We know she called you.
She probably told you she was in trouble.
Yeah, maybe she even claimed she's in danger,
that she's scared of Jack,
and you believed her because you know Jack is dangerous.
Because Jack himself showed you.
So you came to her rescue exactly like they wanted you to.
They've been setting you up from the start.
You two have concocted a fascinating story,
yet there are holes in your plot,
namely I can't be the fall guy for a crime
I'm not going to commit.
Yeah, that's why they're going to make you commit it.
First you'll walk up to her.
She'll be thrilled to see you.
Thank you for coming.
You're my hero.
You know I'd do anything for you.
Such bourgeois sentiment would never fall past my lips.
I'm giving you the gist.
She'll tell you
that she's made a horrible mistake with Jack.
You're the one I want to be with.
Let's run away together.
I hear that Prague is expected to endure the melting
of the ice caps exceptionally well.
But first there's something she needs you to do.
We need start-up money. Prague isn't cheap.
Jack and I had a plan to steal...
Something. We're not sure what it is yet.
But you should steal it instead.
Why me?
Good question.
Jack is paranoid. He knows I'm having doubts.
He's been watching me very closely.
If he catches me...
We all know what will happen.
Don't worry. I would never let that happen.
Come on.
When you're with Eva,
Jack will disable the security system and steal the item.
It has to be something small enough to carry on himself
without being noticed.
Jack will give Eva the all-clear sign once he has the item,
then she'll know it's safe to send you in.
Then he'll rig the security just in time
for you to walk into the exhibit and get caught red-handed.
Hold it right there. I don't have anything.
Jack already stole the item. The charge will never stick.
Fair point.
Jack and Eva will replace the real item with a fake.
And you'll steal it, pocket it,
and now you'll be caught red-handed.
Got it.
It's a decent plan, except for one thing.
Eva would never do this to me.
You're the one who's been trying to persuade us
that she's a con artist not to be trusted.
Yeah, and she's a really good con with a code.
She would never send me to prison.
That is the ultimate betrayal.
Give me the eagle pen.
What? What are you doing?
I am proving you both wrong.
Excuse me.
I'm glad you're here.
I wasn't sure that you'd show up.
You would never ask a question you didn't know the answer to.
You knew I'd come.
So why am I here?
Jack's furious and paranoid.
He knows there's something going on between us.
Only simple minds would fail to see our connection.
He feels threatened by you.
Understandably.
And you know how dangerous he can be when he's threatened.
No sign of the security box Jack tampered with.
It must be on another floor.
No sign of Jack here either.
Well, my guess is, he's going after the target right now.
Let's search those other floors.
You've seen the inventory. Any idea what he's after?
Victorian jewels, Faberge Eggs,
some sketches by Matisse--
I'd go for the jewels.
No, it's the Egg.
Come with me.
Let's leave together,
pick up where we left off in Morocco.
Need I remind you, we never left off in Morocco.
I was left alone and broke.
So we'll rewrite the ending,
but no more conning our way onto cruise ships.
We'll go in style.
I do have a taxi,
but the ferry ride would be long.
But we would find a way to pass the time.
Flight's about to land in San Francisco.
Any word from Diana?
Not yet. Should hear something soon.
Hey, the security box.
Or we could set off on our adventure
with millions in our pockets.
I won't get that much for my cab.
Jack and I were gonna steal something from this gallery,
but you should do it instead,
Steal it right out from under him.
That is a cruel and brilliant plan.
I-I never should have expected less.
The wires have been rerouted.
Jack disabled the alarm so he can pull off the theft.
Then he'll switch the wires back before Mozzie walks in.
Think you can beat him to the punch?
I need to know what I'm stealing.
The uncertainty is aggravating my dermatitis.
An Easter present from Alexander III
to his lovely wife, Maria.
Ah, Faberge Egg.
They're going for the Egg.
See? This is why you need me.
Russian exhibit's on the fourth floor.
That's where Jack has to be.
All right, go. I got this.
F.B.I.
"Man is the only kind of varmint sets his own trap,
baits it, then steps in it."
Steinbeck.
Didn't he also say you have the right to remain silent?
I think that was Sergeant Friday.
Yeah. I get those two mixed up.
I want my lawyer.
Haven't gotten to that part yet.
Since you clearly don't need this,
let me take it off your hands.
Now to find his better half.
We have to go.
I'm guessing this wasn't part of your plan.
What? It's part of yours, though, isn't it?
It's safe to assume that by now the F.B.I has Jack
and the egg.
How much-- how much time do I have?
Not enough.
Oh.
Well played.
You were a worthy opponent.
You found my weak spot.
You knew I would come if you called.
Somewhere along the line, I misjudged.
This plan would have worked five years ago.
Five years ago there would be no Neal,
no suit for that matter.
By myself, I would have walked right into your trap.
You're not working alone.
I didn't see that coming.
Five years ago, I wouldn't either.
I'm sorry, Mozzie.
No, no.
You're not, Eva.
You're conning me to help you escape.
It doesn't mean I'm not sorry.
I would have done it anyway.
My plan includes a very generous escape hatch.
Unlike you, I live by a code.
The alarms have heightened security.
There are guards at every door.
What do you say about one last con?
After all, they are playing our song.
We lost the eagle. What the hell is Mozzie up to?
Are you sure this is what you want after all we've shared?
You know what we have shared?
Nothing but lies and deception.
We're securing this area. You two can't do this here.
You know what? You're right.
You are absolutely right. We can't do this anymore.
We're always trying to one up and outsmart each other.
And you're willing to throw that all away?
You can't find what we have with someone else.
I know.
That's why we have to say good-bye.
You can't hold me here like a criminal.
I have rights.
What's going on?
I have to use the bathroom.
I'm not authorized to let anyone through.
I feel like a caged animal.
That is still such a rush.
I'd ask you to come with me, but--
But-
you won't ask a question you don't know the answer to.
Where is she? Where's Eva?
I don't know. She got away.
The good ones always do.
We have a suspect on the run.
All units be on the lookout for Eva Perkins.
He'll never find her.
Well, we got Jack and the egg.
He'll be okay.
How about you?
I'm fine. I have my bees.
Well, it looks like you're a bachelor again.
You ready to find a new sweetheart to con?
Uh, nope.
I can't.
I'm taken.
Okay.
Let me guess. No sign of Eva?
Forget Eva.
I just got off the phone with the ASAC in San Francisco.
The panthers never showed up.
What? What happened?
No idea. Damn it, we almost had them.
Do we know what they were after?
We ran a list of the passengers--
Nothing suspicious.
Diplomats, bank CEOs,
people with access to valuable targets?
Nothing.
What about cargo?
We're being stonewalled.
The airline won't confirm or deny the presence
of anything valuable on the plane.
Which means there was something.
Exactly.
Well, I just mobilized half the agents
in San Francisco for nothing,
and now I got a dozen people above me demanding answers.
There's something more going on with the Panthers,
something we're missing.
Well, we better find out what that is and soon,
or else this whole thing is gonna blow up on both of us.
All right, what's up?
We have good news.
You know where the Panthers are?
Would you settle for knowing what they're going after?
Based on Neal's missions with the Panthers,
we know the big score has something to do
with Braxnet Security.
Because Neal stole the stamp
to clock their security response times.
Right, and Atlastech,
where he took the Exodus file from.
So, whatever the Panthers are targeting,
it's something these two companies have in common.
Turns out both companies have a long list
of government contracts.
When we cross-referenced their client lists,
only one remained.
The Panthers are going after the Fed.
And the Fed only handles one thing.
Cash. They're going after cash.
And not just any cash.
We know the flight today was coming from Europe, right?
When Americans travel to Europe,
they exchange american currency for Euros.
That money's collected by the central bank
then shipped back to the U.S.
Where, according to the randomizer,
it could be delivered to any one of 12 airports,
any city with a Federal Reserve.
I've heard of this. It's completely classified.
Not even the F.B.I's kept in the loop.
That's why they use the randomizer.
It ensures no one knows when or where the money
will be delivered until the day of the shipment.
So where does Braxnet fit into all of this?
They provide security for the shipment.
The money's held at airport warehouses
until the Fed picks it up and redistributes it.
How much cash are we talking?
Each shipment contains as much as $500 million.
And the icing on the cake--
the cash is clean, completely untraceable.
The Panthers are going after half a billion dollars
in unmarked cash.
Woodford...
Nice of you to drop by.
Figured I'd return the favor.
Not here to exchange pleasantries, I see.
There's a small problem.
It seems there's some mole in the operation.
