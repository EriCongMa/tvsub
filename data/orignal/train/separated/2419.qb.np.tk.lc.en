i can &apos;t . i can &apos;t . i can &apos;t .
turn it off .
she &apos;s ruthless without her humanity , damon .
when silas was buried by the witch qetsiyah ,
she left him with the cure .
she knew that he wanted to die ,
be reunited with his one true love .
bonnie is the one that can drop the veil
between this side and the other side .
you will open the floodgates
for every supernatural being that has ever died .
silas , show me your real face .
now , why would i do that
when i can look like whomever i want you to see .
so what are we gonna do ?
lock her up , make her life a living hell .
you boys want to play games ?
let &apos;s see who breaks first .
elena , you &apos;re here .
hey , i got valedictorian .
you can help me write my speech .
pass .
oh , come on .
we &apos;re graduating this year . this is it .
we &apos;re gonna have to soak up every second before--
wait . something is not right .
i don &apos;t want to be here .
what is wrong with you ?
don &apos;t you want to be with your friends ,
graduation parties , caps , gowns ?
you know the drill .
what is this ?
we &apos;re not really here , are we ?
we &apos;re in my head .
relax .
i just want to show you all the things
you &apos;ve been missing out on since you took
the giant leap over the cuckoo &apos;s nest .
last thing i remember--
let me guess . prom-- beautiful dress ,
gorgeous hair ,
you trying to murder bonnie .
it &apos;s a good thing i was there to take care of you .
you starved me , you and stefan .
yeah . well , we had to keep you weak
so i could bring you here .
see , the way i figure it is , if i can make you nostalgic ,
then you &apos;re already halfway to getting your humanity back .
it &apos;s not gonna work , damon .
well , there are other ways to provoke an emotional response .
you still have her locked in the safe ?
you &apos;ve been in her head for an hour .
what , still nothing ?
how you doing in there ?
come on .
is the old you ready to come out and play ?
go to hell .
ok .
back you go .
we can do this the nice way ,
or we can do it the other way ,
but either way , we &apos;re not stopping
until you turn your humanity switch back on .
so i &apos;m gonna let you think about that ,
and i &apos;m gonna come back for you in a couple hours
or a couple years
because all we have is time .
where is she ? i want to see her .
we &apos;re not letting anyone see her .
that &apos;s the whole point .
isolation leads to misery , leads to emotion .
she &apos;s been here for days . she hasn &apos;t improved at all ?
look . she doesn &apos;t want to , caroline ,
not yet , all right ?
she &apos;s devastated . she lost her brother .
she attacked her friends .
she killed an innocent woman .
you said that you knew how to help her .
i did say that . we are .
how , by torturing her ?
it &apos;s not torture . it &apos;s an intervention .
the only chance we have with her
is to provoke her , to trigger something--
fear , anger , self @-@ pity , anything .
let me talk to her
before any more interventioning .
if she &apos;s weak , she can &apos;t hurt me .
please just let me try .
good luck .
i brought you something .
it doesn &apos;t have any vervain in it , i swear .
i just figured a little blood
might help you think straight .
for the record , i don &apos;t agree with what they &apos;re doing .
i mean , i agree that you need to turn your humanity back on ,
but i don &apos;t think that making you suffer is the way to do it .
that &apos;s not who you are .
what makes you such an expert on who i am ?
because we &apos;ve been friends forever .
i tried to kill you , caroline .
i &apos;m not exactly bff material anymore .
you should move on .
i am not going to give up on you .
this annoying , clingy thing that you &apos;re doing ,
did it ever occur to you
maybe that &apos;s why both your boyfriends skipped town ?
i mean , i know that tyler said
he was running for his life .
maybe he was running from you .
and klaus ... i mean ,
let &apos;s just say it .
nobody likes a tease .
hey , i &apos;m not judging .
might be nice to have a bad boy ruffle those perfect feathers .
you &apos;re in pain . you &apos;re lashing out .
i get it , but you can &apos;t stay this way forever .
we &apos;re about to graduate and start new lives ,
and you deserve--
are you seriously talking about high @-@ school graduation ?
caroline , do you realize
how pathetic you &apos;re gonna look
in that cap and gown pretending to be human
while your mom fake @-@ smiles
and just counts down the minutes until you leave town
so that you can stop being a reminder
that her daughter is a repulsive ,
blood @-@ sucking , control freak monster ?
it &apos;s really too bad
stefan stopped me before i put you out of your misery ,
but , hey , here &apos;s to second chances .
elena ?
do whatever you have to do .
i &apos;m gonna be upstairs .
i was wondering if you were gonna say hello or keep ignoring me .
i was working .
i see you compelled the bartenders again .
i &apos;m celebrating .
my brothers and i have parted company .
elijah and nik have run off to new orleans
chasing god knows what , and i am finally free .
yeah . i heard about that .
did you hear that i lost the cure to silas ?
i was this close
to the life that i always wanted ,
and then , poof , gone in a heartbeat .
i &apos;m sorry . i know how much you wanted it .
please . i know you were planning on stealing it for elena .
i never had a chance , did i ?
i meant what i said ,
but if you want to feel sorry for yourself , go ahead .
why don &apos;t you stay and have a drink ?
i can &apos;t .
i &apos;ve got to go meet caroline .
are they still keeping elena trapped in the salvatore mansion ?
i happen to like her just the way she is .
it &apos;s tragic that they &apos;re trying so desperately
to fix something that isn &apos;t broken .
elena was my friend
long before she was your mean @-@ girl sidekick .
so if you &apos;re upset that you lost the cure
and your brothers ditched you ,
why are you still in mystic falls ?
some of us don &apos;t have the option of leaving .
some of us are broke
and failing all of our classes and stuck here .
so why don &apos;t you take your freedom and get the hell out of town ?
i would .
bonnie , where have you been ?
i left you , like , 90 million messages .
studying french .
we still have final exams , remember ?
oh , don &apos;t remind me . look .
this whole thing with elena ,
it &apos;s about to get brutal ,
and i know that she &apos;s not your favorite person right now ,
but i could really use you over here .
for what , moral support or so you can check up on me ?
moral support and maybe just a tiny check @-@ in
to make sure that silas isn &apos;t playing
any more pesky little mind games with you .
i &apos;m fine , ok ?
silas doesn &apos;t control me anymore .
and i think i &apos;ll pass on the invite .
elena tried to kill me .
i &apos;m not quite ready to forgive and forget .
i &apos;m gonna call you later , ok ?
i got to go .
lying , scheming ,
and a secret rendezvous with moi ?
not very bonnie bennett @-@ y ,
especially when elena needs her favorite witch .
this has nothing to do with them .
this is between you and me .
all right . well , luckily for you ,
i &apos;ve got some spare time on my hands .
you said you have an offer that i can &apos;t refuse .
well , by all means .
what do you have in mind ?
good . you &apos;re awake .
we thought you could use a little sunshine .
looking for this ?
aw . you know the rules .
bad girls don &apos;t get nice jewelry .
you took my ring .
i &apos;m devastated .
and bored .
can i go back to solitary now ?
no . i kind of like you in the hot seat .
whenever you &apos;re ready , brother .
am i supposed to be scared ?
you will be .
and when you are , focus on that fear .
it &apos;s the key to getting your humanity back .
you &apos;re not gonna burn me .
you don &apos;t think so ?
no .
and even if you do manage to get my emotions back ,
i &apos;ll remember all this .
and i &apos;ll hate both of you for it .
worth the risk .
that feels better , huh ?
how about a little gratitude
or any human emotion whatsoever ?
and we can stop this .
i didn &apos;t quite catch that .
i said , i &apos;m gonna kill you .
bingo . see ? there &apos;s a little rage .
i should have figured that &apos;d be the first emotion that came out of you .
i tend to pull that out of people .
elena , look at me .
we don &apos;t want to do this , ok ?
you can stop this right now .
it &apos;s your choice .
kind of funny , actually ,
you being the one to pull back the curtain .
i bet part of you enjoys it
since , you know , i dumped you and all .
that was downright vindictive .
see ? i think now we &apos;re breaking through
that tough candy shell
and getting into the ooey @-@ gooey
rich center of your humanity .
this is good . i think we should shine some light on the subject .
let me guess ...
this is gonna hurt you a lot more than it hurts me .
look , i know what you &apos;re going through .
after all you &apos;ve done ,
you &apos;re afraid to face the guilt you &apos;ll feel
if you turned your emotions back on .
the only way we can help you
is to make the alternative hurt even worse .
oh , we have to keep talking .
if we don &apos;t keep talking ,
then i won &apos;t be able to stop myself from listening in .
and i can &apos;t stand to hear elena in pain .
what do you want to talk about ?
i don &apos;t know . anything .
i ordered you a cap and gown .
you did ?
i just figured that you &apos;d forget ,
so i ordered yours when i ordered mine .
and i got one for elena , too .
it &apos;s gonna work .
we &apos;re gonna get elena back .
what the hell is she doing here ?
i don &apos;t mean to interfere .
it &apos;s just i happen to know all they keep in this house
is blood and booze .
so i brought a peace offering .
burgers ?
thanks .
yeah , we can &apos;t really entertain right now ,
but thanks for stopping by .
i think i might stay .
matt mentioned that he was failing classes
and needed a study buddy .
you &apos;re failing ?
well , why didn &apos;t you ask me to help you study ?
well , i didn &apos;t exactly ask her .
well , what classes are you failing ?
i &apos;m not failing .
i &apos;m just really , really behind .
history and italian and math .
matt !
this year &apos;s been a little distracting .
we could both help .
&quot; all hands on deck . &quot;
that &apos;s the motto around here , right ?
we don &apos;t have a motto .
look , if you need to study ,
we &apos;re gonna study .
i &apos;m gonna go home ,
and i &apos;m gonna get my flash cards and my study guides
and some energy bars .
this is gonna be good .
you dated that ?
she likes projects .
who &apos;s there ?
oh , my god .
hello , caroline .
let me get this straight .
you want me to hand over silas &apos; tombstone ?
what makes you think i even have it ?
i know you took it from the island .
you &apos;re a scavenger . you &apos;d never leave it behind .
so you &apos;re working for silas now , huh ?
running errands for the big , bad immortal .
i didn &apos;t switch sides .
in two days , there &apos;ll be a full moon .
silas wants me to harness its power to drop the veil
between our side and the other side .
he wants to take the cure , and then he wants to die .
i said i &apos;d help him , and i &apos;ve been hiding from him ever since ,
buying time .
time for what ?
you don &apos;t need to worry about it .
you just need to bring me the tombstone .
it &apos;s a hunk of rock .
what do you even want with it ?
the less you know , the better .
silas is psychic .
he can get into people &apos;s heads , read their minds ,
make them see things that aren &apos;t really there .
i &apos;m taking a big enough risk just talking to you .
ok . then how do i know that you &apos;re not him ?
you don &apos;t . but i &apos;m not .
and what makes you so sure that i &apos;m not him ?
because he can &apos;t get into my head anymore .
because i am the only one who can see his true face .
what &apos;s in it for me ?
bring me the tombstone .
help me stop silas from unleashing hell on earth .
believe me , i &apos;ll make it worth your while .
you &apos;re gonna thank me for this .
after you turn it back on ,
you &apos;ll realize life with no emotions blew .
you know what else blew ?
being sired to you .
going every day believing that i was in love with you .
i remember every horrible moment of it .
and you ...
so scared that it wasn &apos;t real .
guess what . it wasn &apos;t .
you were right .
so go ahead . keep trying to get the old me back .
who knows ? maybe stefan and i will give it another go .
i am the girl that you love .
you wouldn &apos;t do anything to actually hurt me .
you just proved that .
so what do i really have to be afraid of ?
so that went well .
every other vampire turns it on , no problem .
you kill . you feed .
you do all the awful things that a vampire does .
and then when you &apos;re done , you turn it back on .
why is she being so stubborn ?
because she has nothing to come back to .
her home &apos;s gone . her family &apos;s gone .
she alienated her friends .
she destroyed her relationships .
no . she wants to come back .
scaring the hell out of her should have worked .
she &apos;s smart . she knows we &apos;re not gonna hurt her .
all right . so we get somebody else ,
somebody who really will hurt her .
who ?
katherine ?
think about it .
she &apos;s the reason jeremy &apos;s dead , right ?
so if anybody &apos;s gonna provoke an emotion , it &apos;s her .
so we call her and then what ?
beg her to help us out of the kindness of her own heart ?
you kidding me ?
katherine was just abandoned by elijah .
she has nothing . she has no one .
we invite her into our house
to come torture elena .
there &apos;s no way she &apos;s gonna turn that down .
everyone said that you were gone for good .
that &apos;s true .
but i never meant to go without saying good @-@ bye .
you don &apos;t owe me an explanation .
you &apos;re moving on . by all means , go .
that &apos;s just it , isn &apos;t it ?
i never had any intention of moving on .
the truth is , i &apos;ve tried to stop thinking about you .
and i can &apos;t .
come to new orleans .
what are you afraid of ?
you !
i &apos;m afraid of you .
wouldn &apos;t it be more accurate to say
you &apos;re afraid of yourself ,
your darkest desires ?
elena was right , wasn &apos;t she ?
deep down , you long to have your perfect feathers ruffled .
how do you know what elena said to me in that cell ?
then again ... there &apos;s so much to be afraid of , isn &apos;t there ,
like what i &apos;ll do to you if your friend bonnie
doesn &apos;t come out of hiding .
where is she ?
silas .
where is she ? !
she &apos;s not at home . she &apos;s not anywhere .
bonnie is playing games with me .
and i don &apos;t like it .
tell her i &apos;m looking for her .
tell her to come out of the shadows .
tell her that this ...
is only the beginning .
what time will caroline return from the train station ?
that &apos;s handy .
sort of a cheat , though , isn &apos;t it ?
not everyone &apos;s had a thousand years
to learn everything about everything .
i &apos;m not sure how good i am at learning italian .
i was fluent in the 12th century ,
but languages have a way of evolving .
so can you help or not ?
of course i can .
don &apos;t be cranky . i was just teasing .
i &apos;m sorry . i just don &apos;t want to get left behind
when all my friends go to college
and i &apos;m the only repeat senior .
the only reason that you are failing is
because you &apos;re preoccupied with training doomed hunters
and dealing with elena &apos;s drama .
you need better friends ,
like me .
i could compel you good grades ,
get a scholarship .
i don &apos;t want to do that .
why not ? everyone needs an advantage in life .
i could be yours .
when you convinced me to save april young &apos;s life at the prom ,
i realized that i could be a better person .
and i &apos;m grateful for that .
so let me give you some advice .
take advantage of what i &apos;m offering you .
make something of yourself .
for the record ,
anyone who leaves you behind is a fool .
i wouldn &apos;t .
what a beautiful sentiment .
seriously ?
you can &apos;t knock ?
sorry . i didn &apos;t realize we were standing on formalities .
what the hell are you doing here ?
you didn &apos;t get the memo ?
i &apos;m here to talk some sense into poor emotionless elena .
are you out of your mind ?
you got a better idea , prom king ?
unless you want me to lock you up in there with her ,
i suggest you shut up and let the adults handle this .
well , it looks like the lunatics have taken over the asylum .
where are you going ?
i &apos;m calling caroline .
there &apos;s no way we &apos;re letting that psycho in there with elena .
caroline !
where have you been ?
matt !
we have to get out of here .
no , caroline . caroline , wait . it &apos;s ok .
no , it &apos;s not ok .
silas is out there .
and he made me think that he was klaus ...
what are you talking about ? what &apos;s silas want with you ?
he &apos;s trying to get to bonnie .
do you know where bonnie is ?
if i knew where she was , i wouldn &apos;t bother with you .
now , get me bonnie , or i &apos;m going to kill someone .
maybe i &apos;ll start with your mother .
no one in the house can help you .
find bonnie or i &apos;ll kill the person you love the most .
i know . i promised i wouldn &apos;t work too late .
mom , i need you to get home
and lock all the doors right now .
don &apos;t let anyone inside ,
not even me because i have a key , so i can let myself in .
do you understand ?
what &apos;s going on ?
just do it , ok ? i &apos;m on my way .
oh , honey , you look awful .
what the hell are you doing here ?
your boyfriends invited me .
they want to know if you still have a heart .
there it is .
your bodyguards won &apos;t let me kill you ,
but i can rip your throat out .
so i don &apos;t have to listen to you whine .
but first , satisfy my curiosity .
what did you tell elijah back in willoughby ?
that &apos;s why you &apos;re here .
he dumped you , didn &apos;t he ?
now you &apos;re just looking for a scapegoat .
tell me what you said to turn him against me
or i will feed you your own eyeballs .
i didn &apos;t have to say anything .
look at you .
a self @-@ obsessed egomaniac
on the run for 5 centuries .
what good would you be to anyone ?
you &apos;re the definition of damaged goods .
no wonder elijah left you .
yeah , i &apos;ve done some pretty horrible things to survive .
but unlike you , poor , delicate elena ,
i don &apos;t turn it off .
i deal with it .
you wouldn &apos;t last a week as a vampire
without everyone fawning over you .
but i &apos;d love to see you try .
all that pain and torture of her took quite a thirst .
it couldn &apos;t have anything to do
with the fact that elena called you out on your
recent boy trouble , could it ?
sorry . i couldn &apos;t help but overhear .
did you ever think elena would have been better off
if she &apos;d never met you ?
you &apos;re trying to get a rise out of me ?
because my emotions are fine .
i love elena . i despise you .
mm , so romantic .
so doomed to fail .
you know , as soon as she goes back to her old self ,
she &apos;ll go straight to stefan .
that &apos;s the tragedy of you .
you never get the girl .
she &apos;s gone .
what ?
elena &apos;s not in her cell . i &apos;m gonna check the grounds .
find out what she did .
did i forget to lock her in ?
let &apos;s just say i &apos;ve lost interest in elena &apos;s recovery .
i &apos;d rather watch her tear through an orphanage .
imagine trying to come back from a spiral like that .
elena &apos;s gone ? what happened ?
donovan , you &apos;re coming with me .
why should he ?
because elena &apos;s hungry and missing .
for once , his life might actually have a purpose .
bonnie , why aren &apos;t you answering ?
silas isn &apos;t going to just give up .
you &apos;re the only one that can stop him . call me .
caroline , what &apos;s going on ?
mom , don &apos;t come any closer . stop .
what &apos;s wrong ?
i don &apos;t know how to tell if it &apos;s really you .
what if this is another trick ?
well , he can get in my head .
and he would have known that i called you .
ok , caroline . it &apos;s me .
it &apos;s your mother .
i don &apos;t know what &apos;s happening ,
but everything &apos;s going to be ok .
all right ?
you just need to talk to me .
hi . how &apos;s it going ?
oh , good .
please help me .
matt .
thank god you found me .
elena , stop . i know you don &apos;t want to do this .
i know you don &apos;t want to hurt me .
i &apos;m a vampire , matt .
the thing about vampires is that we need to feed .
no , but you &apos;re more than that .
you &apos;re my friend . you &apos;re my oldest friend .
you &apos;re the girl that i &apos;ve loved longer than i can remember .
whatever wall you want to put up ,
i know that still means something to you .
deep down ...
it probably does mean something ...
but i am really hungry .
bonnie hasn &apos;t called back yet .
i just don &apos;t understand why she hasn &apos;t called .
caroline ?
there you are .
what &apos;s going on ?
are you all right ?
i &apos;ve been calling you for hours .
sorry . i came as soon as i got the message .
caroline , let me in .
let me help .
how do i know it &apos;s you ?
silas keeps getting in my head , attacking me .
he says he wants to know where you are .
he threatened my mother .
caroline ?
mom , just stay there .
caroline , that is not your mother .
what &apos;s going on ?
oh , my god .
did you really think you could hide from me ,
bonnie ?
i &apos;m here now . what did you do to her mother ?
she &apos;s right where you left her .
mom ?
mom !
i thought you and i were on the same side .
the full moon isn &apos;t for two more days .
i &apos;ve been gathering my strength ,
preparing myself .
you &apos;re the only one who can do this spell .
so i can &apos;t hurt you .
but i can hurt the people you love .
you do understand that , right ?
i understand . i will do your spell .
i will drop the veil . and i will help you die .
i promise .
just don &apos;t hurt my friends .
come on . please . please , please , please .
mom ...
your promise is binding , bonnie .
if you break it , you have to answer to me .
i won &apos;t break it .
then you should leave this house right now .
and the next time i come looking for you ,
i expect you to be waiting .
come on !
open--open your eyes , mom .
you need my blood in your system . come on .
mom .
please , mom . please ...
mom ...
mom ?
oh , come on . i barely drained an artery .
come on . get up . i &apos;m hungry .
and my head &apos;s fuzzy . i can &apos;t think straight .
i need more .
elena , stop .
but you &apos;re so good .
you &apos;re cut off .
let go of me .
stop it .
enough .
you are acting like a little spoiled brat .
you know that ?
you think that we can &apos;t punish you .
maybe not .
but i can sure punish him .
elena .
seriously ? you think this is ...
shut up .
i &apos;m done playing nice .
turn your emotions back on right now , elena ,
or so help me , god ,
i will give you something to be sad about .
i will kill him right here in front of you .
damon .
don &apos;t &quot; damon &quot; me .
if she doesn &apos;t love anyone , fine .
prove it .
and if i &apos;m wrong , what difference does it make ?
one less bus boy .
elena ...
you &apos;re bluffing .
how about now ?
you feel anything now ?
you angry i just turned your buddy into road kill ?
or are you sad
that the guy that everybody loves is just a bag of bones ?
remember when he was a little kid , huh ?
warm heart , big , goofy smile ,
his whole life ahead of him .
i guess it was a good idea that he was wearing this .
oh , god , matt .
you feeling that weight lifting off your chest ?
that &apos;s joy .
because your friend isn &apos;t dead .
that &apos;s emotion , elena .
that &apos;s humanity .
you &apos;re gonna be ok .
no .
look at me .
no . no . no . it &apos;s not ok .
elena .
whate i done ?
no , no .
what did i do ? i almost killed him .
matt . i almost-- and then bonnie
and caroline . i just--no , no .
i mean , the woman , the waitress . i actually killed that waitress .
no ! i killed ...
that waitress .
elena .
look at me . look at me .
i know this stage , ok ?
the emotions are overwhelming you .
you just have to focus on one thing , ok ?
no , i can &apos;t . i can &apos;t .
you just find that one thing inside of you that makes you strong .
it &apos;s in there .
just latch on to it .
channel everything you &apos;re feeling
into that one emotion .
find the thing inside of you that makes you want to live .
elena , let it in .
let it in .
that &apos;s good .
that &apos;s it .
that &apos;s it .
just breathe it in . blow everything else out .
that &apos;s good .
that &apos;s good .
you ok ?
no .
i &apos;m not ok .
but i &apos;ll get better .
come on .
ok , this will work .
mom ?
open your eyes . come on .
wake up . you have to wake up .
you have to see me graduate .
i swear i &apos;ll get ...
i swear i &apos;ll get you out of this town
and find you a nice man .
mom !
i &apos;ve never actually seen that ring in action before .
does it hurt ?
you mean getting my neck snapped
or coming back from the dead ?
because they both hurt like hell .
did it work ?
well , it looks like elena &apos;s emotional floodgates
have been burst wide open .
so she &apos;ll be back to her dull ,
sympathetic self in no time .
here .
that was a brave thing to do .
she saved me from drowning at the bottom of that river .
i &apos;m just doing what i can to pay her back .
there aren &apos;t enough apologies in the world
for the part that i played in this .
running you off the bridge ,
elena becoming a vampire to save you .
if you don &apos;t want me to cheat you into college , fine .
we &apos;ll do it the hard way .
but , matt ...
i will spend every day until graduation
trying to find a way to pay you back .
i &apos;m perfectly aware
that tombstone isn &apos;t just a hunk of rock .
no kidding .
and it got me thinking ,
all big spells require a source of power ,
a recurring element like a full moon , a comet .
but that tombstone is filled with the blood of your ancient relative
katsooyay or whatever .
qetsiyah .
she was powerful enough to create the other side .
so maybe if you have her blood ,
you don &apos;t need a full moon to drop the veil .
maybe you can do it whenever you want .
the thing i can &apos;t figure out is
why do you want to drop the veil at all ?
i have my reasons .
and again , i ask ,
what &apos;s in it for me ?
you &apos;ll get the one thing you want most in this world--
freedom , survival .
never having to run from anyone again .
once i &apos;ve dropped the veil ,
i can speak to qetsiyah .
she created the spell
that made silas truly immortal ,
invulnerable to any weapon .
you &apos;d like that for yourself ,
wouldn &apos;t you ?
i can give it to you .
bonnie bennett , we have a deal .
there you go .
how you feeling ?
the pain &apos;s still there .
the grief ... and shame .
i get it now .
shutting it off , it &apos;s a cheat .
i mean , you put up this wall
and shut out everything that makes you who you are .
nothing affects you , nothing matters .
but things do matter--
things that have happened cannot be undone .
and now i know there &apos;s something i need to do about that .
elena , what you need to do is rest ,
take it easy for a couple of days .
maybe even a couple of years . here .
i--i &apos;m done resting . i have to get ready .
there &apos;s so much that i have to do .
what are you talking about ?
think about it . it &apos;s so obvious .
go back far enough , there &apos;s one person who brought us to this ...
who ruined our lives ...
and look at you two .
everything that &apos;s happened to you , she did that .
she brought klaus to mystic falls ,
she turned caroline into a vampire .
she killed my brother .
it all comes down to her--katherine .
ok , stefan said to focus on one thing , so i did .
i focused on hate .
and i hate her so much .
well , i don &apos;t think that &apos;s what he meant .
elena , katherine &apos;s not worth your time .
even if you spend 10 minutes of your life hating her , she wins .
