are you watching me ?
do i look dashing ?
nobody says dashing .
james bond says dashing .
you think you &apos;re james bond ?
i could be james bond .
i &apos;ve got connery &apos;s swagger ...
definitely daniel craig &apos;s physique ...
lazenby &apos;s ...
i have no idea what he &apos;s known for .
you okay ?
i had an interesting conversation with louis last night .
he said i should be careful of you and rachel .
do i have anything to worry about ?
no .
he hates me , and he &apos;s just trying to get to me through you .
so you never--
no .
you got nothing to worry about .
she &apos;s just a friend .
okay .
and i &apos;m late .
i &apos;ll call .
okay .
okay .
we should go out .
uh , this is going out .
no , i mean you and me and rachel
should go on a double date .
does she have a @-@ a boyfriend ?
i , uh , don &apos;t know .
no .
going on a double date with somebody from work
might be kind of weird .
if i get to know her , then i won &apos;t worry .
it &apos;ll be fun .
just a couple friends going out . right ?
awesome .
cab ? someone steal your bike ?
i have a lot on my mind . it &apos;s a safety issue .
what are you talking about ?
louis told jenny about rachel and me .
it was one kiss , and she kissed me .
okay , soap opera , just give me my documents .
harvey .
cameron .
how the hell are you ?
good to see you .
too damn long .
cameron dennis , district attorney ,
meet mike ross , my associate .
hi .
i guess that makes you his harvey .
sorry ?
harvey was my associate .
i taught him everything he knows .
best a.d.a. to come up since me .
you taught him ?
&quot; never go to court . &quot;
that &apos;s me .
&quot; it &apos;s not about caring . it &apos;s about winning . &quot;
me .
no way . harvey &apos;s harvey .
yeah , exactly .
we should , uh , catch up , have lunch .
hey , you know what ? this is crazy .
i &apos;m free for dinner tonight .
just cancel whatever you have ,
and tell jessica i demanded that you clear your schedule .
dinner it is . it &apos;d be nice .
that &apos;s my boy .
all right , you know where to find me , 8 : 00 .
glad i ran into you , harvey .
ross , you still work here ?
funny .
yeah , &apos; cause i thought after i beat you--
yeah , i got it .
thanks for expediting .
yeah .
do you need something ?
did you know that harvey , uh , was a prosecutor ?
no , he wasn &apos;t .
yeah , he was .
i &apos;ve read every bio at the firm .
people work for the d.a. &apos; s office , it &apos;s on their bio .
well , we ran into cameron dennis this morning .
the d.a. ?
yeah .
he says that harvey &apos;s the best a.d.a. he &apos;s ever had .
no . come here .
see ? nothing about being a prosecutor .
yeah .
i need you to go on a double date with me and jenny .
yeah , not gonna happen .
you have to . listen to me .
louis warned her about you and me .
wha--
how did he even get--
you know how .
&apos;cause he walked in right after you kissed me .
if you say no ,
she &apos;s gonna think something &apos;s going on between us .
okay . i &apos;ll go .
thank you .
freakin &apos; louis .
oh , is this harvey ?
okay , you are definitely sending me that photo .
westlaw lists him as prosecutor of record
on pages and pages of cases .
i told you .
i don &apos;t get it .
why wouldn &apos;t he have this on his bio ?
because .
harvey &apos;s got something to hide .
it touches some idealistic core of your being ,
where even the greatest cynic has not given up hope .
that &apos;s why we listen to music .
oh , that &apos;s beautiful , louis .
really ?
and i think your decision to leave law
to become a music critic
is in everyone &apos;s best interests .
okay , i was quoting peter sellars .
i just got $ 1,000 @-@ a @-@ head tickets to nixon in china .
are you two dating now ? should i come back ?
sit down , harvey .
love it when you talk to me like my third grade teacher , mrs. coe .
gentlemen .
malcolm price died last week .
truly great loss for humanity .
you want to mock the dead ? fine .
but his tabloid ,
nothing but the truth , has made us a fortune .
price has left his estate , ten companies ,
including the tabloid , to his two daughters ,
madison and kelsey .
we have been asked to divide the assets up fairly .
and i &apos;m here why ?
because they hate each other .
malcolm structured the will to bring them back together .
you have a knack for bringing parties together
who don &apos;t see eye to eye .
so why is he here ?
because madison price requested him .
you sure she &apos;s not mixing him up with me ?
hardman had me do some contract work
for her a couple years back ,
so i guess i made an impression .
right .
so you each get a sister .
you think pitting us against each other
is fair to louis &apos; client ?
please . dividing financial assets ?
you couldn &apos;t shine my shoes .
someone should .
well , actually , i personally shine my own shoes ,
so there you go .
oh , lucky them .
how come you always ask donna ,
&quot; donna , by the way ,
those are really nice shoes that louis has on &quot; ?
gentlemen .
we &apos;re on the same side .
and although i would not choose to have you both on this ,
that is how it fell .
so i expect you to put your differences aside
and work together on this
so that everyone can be happy .
can you manage that this time ?
she &apos;s always hated me .
maybe this is a chance to put all that behind you .
i &apos;d like that . really , i would .
but maddie ? i don &apos;t think so .
maybe she &apos;ll surprise you .
kelsey &apos;s a bitch .
she doesn &apos;t deserve any of it .
well , i &apos;m afraid your father didn &apos;t share that point of view .
according to his will , we were meant ...
to find a division of these companies
that makes both of you happy .
but i want to make sure ...
that you &apos;re happy .
you want to know what will make me happy ?
whatever makes her miserable .
it &apos;s simple .
i want nothing but the truth .
my father and i worked together on it for years , and ...
it made me crazy .
the two of them pretending that tabloid was literature .
it means everything to me .
all i want ...
is to sell off that piece of garbage
and for her to get as little as possible .
what made her so mad at you ?
she blames me for our dad leaving her mother
and marrying mine .
how can she think that &apos;s your fault ?
because her mother got pregnant
and used it to rope in my dad .
and then little kelsey became the center of his universe .
do you know what it &apos;s like to have someone hate you
out of pure jealousy ?
we &apos;ll get you the paper .
do you know what it &apos;s like
to watch someone else get all the attention
when you know that you &apos;re twice the person they are ?
she &apos;s not getting that paper .
maddie .
kelsey .
louis .
harvey .
doctor , doctor .
chevy .
nice .
good meeting ?
yeah , we connected . you ?
we &apos;re on the same page .
what was kelsey looking for ?
i don &apos;t know . why don &apos;t you ask jenny ?
you seem to like talking to her .
no , mike , that &apos;s not distracting .
i was just waiting .
for what ?
to not be distracting .
how come harvey doesn &apos;t talk about
working for the d.a. &apos; s office ?
who told you that ?
cameron dennis .
we ran into him this morning .
they &apos;re having dinner .
so that &apos;s why he wouldn &apos;t tell me where he was going .
what &apos;s going on , donna ?
let it go .
don &apos;t ask harvey about this .
what &apos;s the big secret ?
it &apos;s no secret . just ...
don &apos;t .
and what are we talking about ?
the price sisters .
those girls .
do we really have to play nice with louis ?
i wanna crush him .
you wanna crush him ?
get over to the paper , kick the tires ,
and figure out what it &apos;s worth .
i thought we were supposed to use the independent valuations .
what , you think he &apos;s gonna play by the rules ?
i know he won &apos;t .
that &apos;s why you better be three steps ahead of him ,
because i can guarantee you
louis &apos;ll be two steps ahead of you .
speak of the devil ,
her majesty &apos;s here to see you .
i heard that .
you were meant to .
gentlemen .
your highness .
okay , you know what ?
that &apos;s exactly why i &apos;m here .
to be mocked ?
no , to set clear ground rules ,
to keep the negotiation above board .
absolutely .
no kicking , no biting , and no rabbit punches .
and now you &apos;re mocking the ground rules .
no , i &apos;m just mocking you .
point one .
we both agree to use the independent valuations .
absolutely . good point .
point two .
you do not call jessica in to mediate .
this is you and me .
you afraid mom &apos;s gonna take my side ?
no , i know mom &apos;s gonna take your side .
because i &apos;d be right .
point three .
chinese wall .
you can &apos;t access any internal documents that i create .
let &apos;s make jessica proud .
we do this right , everyone walks away happy .
wonderful .
don &apos;t worry . we &apos;ll still crush him .
i heard that .
you were meant to .
care to make a wager ?
our job is to make both sisters happy .
how do we know who wins ?
we &apos;ll know .
usual amount ?
no .
i think we should change it up this time .
i win , i get mike .
you can &apos;t bet me like i &apos;m chattel , louis .
it &apos;s not like he &apos;s gonna win .
one month .
ten days .
harvey .
two weeks .
nine days .
harvey !
all right , you know what ? fine . ten days .
and in return ?
well , that &apos;s tough because anything you have
i wouldn &apos;t want .
what ? you &apos;re gonna bet me for nothing ?
harvey ?
harvey specter .
alexandra leeds .
i hear you &apos;re working for the attorney general &apos;s office .
and you &apos;re fighting for the oppressive capitalists .
winning for the oppressive capitalists .
good for you . we should have lunch .
catch up .
who told you i was coming here tonight ?
no one .
i haven &apos;t seen you in five years .
you wanna catch up ?
you want something from me , and it isn &apos;t lunch .
i want to talk about cameron dennis .
six feet , pisces , wavy hair .
i &apos;m serious .
i haven &apos;t worked for cameron in over a decade .
what &apos;s there to talk about ?
the attorney general is investigating allegations
that he systematically buried evidence to get convictions .
so talk to people who actually work with the guy .
no , that &apos;s the problem . he &apos;s still their boss .
nobody &apos;s talking .
neither am i.
over lunch or anywhere else . so best of luck .
harvey .
i was hoping for some lunch .
i &apos;m having you subpoenaed
to testify before a grand jury .
enjoy your dinner .
give cameron my best .
harvey .
glad you could make it . how are you ?
tell me about the bullshit run @-@ in that you staged this morning .
how long did you have to wait
so that you could pretend to be surprised to see me ?
ten minutes .
you &apos;re never early , but i didn &apos;t want to cut it too close .
i also just had another little run @-@ in with alexandra leeds .
you really want to drag me into this ?
calm down , harvey .
i &apos;m not dragging you into anything .
they &apos;re dragging me into this .
it &apos;s election year nonsense , and i wanted to warn you .
so you asked me here to warn me ?
yeah , and to reassure myself that you &apos;ve got my back .
how bad is it ?
it &apos;s nothing i can &apos;t handle , but i &apos;m glad you &apos;re here .
look , harvey .
whatever differences we had ,
we were a good team .
the truth is that ...
if anything taints the work that we did ,
it &apos;ll be bad for both of us .
is that a threat ?
not at all . it &apos;s just reality .
we put away bad people , harvey .
we fought tough battles , and we won .
i taught you how to win .
that &apos;s not exactly what you taught me .
i know that you didn &apos;t always approve of the means ,
but we both know that the end result was always right .
you &apos;re still the best smooth @-@ talker i know .
use it now . talk your way out of this .
settle . &apos; cause if this goes to court ,
there are skeletons to be found .
they won &apos;t find them .
you wanna bank on that ?
i have your back .
i am not volunteering anything .
but if push comes to shove ,
i won &apos;t perjure myself .
not even for you .
how was dinner with the antichrist ?
subpoena came for you .
what are you gonna do ?
what would you do ?
i &apos;m sorry . are you feeling okay ?
you just asked my advice .
all these years--
yeah , i think that &apos;s a first .
you were there . what would you do ?
i &apos;d tell them everything .
i &apos;d watch cameron go down .
i &apos;d throw a party . i &apos;d drink champagne .
i &apos;d go to bed , and i &apos;d sleep like a baby after i did it .
really ? don &apos;t equivocate .
he &apos;s poison , harvey .
leaving there was huge .
you could &apos;ve gone down a dark road .
and i &apos;m telling you , i would not have followed .
i just got back from the paper .
nice place . it &apos;s a growing asset .
there &apos;s opportunity for expansion .
if we get this thing for kelsey ,
i think she &apos;s set .
i saw elvis there .
great .
exciting .
am i interrupting something , or ... ?
dinner didn &apos;t go well ?
it was okay . old times .
if that &apos;s how you want to play it .
let &apos;s talk about this proposal for louis .
you know what ? why don &apos;t you take a run at it ?
get the best deal you can .
you bet me , and now you &apos;re hanging me out to dry ?
that &apos;s fine . i &apos;ll do it .
and i &apos;ll win .
did you decide what you want him to pay you when i win ?
his tickets to nixon in china .
you want to go to the opera .
no , but louis does ,
and making him miss it would be amusing .
so you get nothing .
you are betting me for nothing .
are you still talking ?
so did you find a date for tonight ?
yep .
and ?
and we &apos;ll see you there .
what ?
i thought that &apos;s what you said you wanted .
to sit with you and jenny
and have her seeing into my brain the whole time ?
seeing what ?
you do remember that we kissed , right ?
i remember .
it &apos;ll be okay .
hi . uh , is this a good time to talk about division of assets ?
no .
is there a better time ?
yes . when harvey &apos;s available .
harvey asked me to handle it .
he thinks you can beat me ?
prove him wrong .
what &apos;s there to lose ?
ex--except for nixon in china , of course .
what do you have for me ?
okay , so there are ten companies .
we propose that kelsey takes
companies one , three , seven , and nine .
so that gives us ...
52.3 % of the assets .
hm , generous , but no .
uh , alternatively ,
we propose that kelsey takes
companies one , two , four , and eight .
that gives you--
54.6 % .
no .
do you have a counterproposal , or--
no .
okay , uh , kelsey takes companies one , seven ,
eight , and nine .
no .
louis , that gives you 60 % of the assets .
yes . but no .
what is it your client wants ?
well , your offer makes it infinitely clear
what your client wants .
the tabloid .
and what my client wants is for your client
to not get what she wants ,
so you can &apos;t have the tabloid , period .
you &apos;re legally required to take these offers to your client .
so bring me up on ethics charges .
or report me to your supervisor .
oh , wait , shit . i am your supervisor .
hold on one second .
go ahead .
what are your complaints ?
have any ? no ? really ?
we &apos;re supposed to find a fair and equitable settlement , louis .
okay , you go run and tell jessica .
oh , wait , that would be breaking the rules ,
and then you &apos;ve have to come work for me .
so why don &apos;t you run along now and get harvey
and tell him to get off his ass and join the negotiations .
because you just failed .
when you left the d.a. &apos; s office ,
you said you were done , you had learned enough ,
and that you were ready to move on .
was that just bullshit ?
you were the one who wanted me to have trial experience .
you said that cameron was the only one that i should learn from .
and what exactly did he teach you ?
harvey , why did you leave ?
he had a case .
i caught him burying a key piece of evidence
he was obligated to turn over .
the guy was guilty .
the defense would &apos;ve used it to let him walk .
all right , what kind of exposure do you have ?
i told him no , but he didn &apos;t listen .
then you were obligated to report him .
which is why i left .
why didn &apos;t you tell me this at the time ?
because you put me there , jessica , to be mentored .
okay ? and it occurred to me ,
that might &apos;ve been exactly what you wanted me to learn .
for the record , it wasn &apos;t .
i &apos;m gonna represent you at this deposition .
i &apos;m gonna try to keep you from talking .
but i think you should .
he was my mentor .
he is a public servant .
he was my mentor .
the standards are higher .
he was my mentor .
and i am not gonna be the one to expose him ,
any more than i &apos;d ever turn on you .
worst dating story-- identical twins .
i was a lab rat for their social experiment .
they were trying to prove that women were shallow
and can &apos;t see beyond the surface .
and they wanted to get laid .
yes , that too .
good times .
so you slept with them both .
almost .
turns out they weren &apos;t identical after all .
excuse me , i am just going to run to the ladies &apos; room .
oh , i &apos;ll go with you .
okay .
what &apos;s wrong , mikey ?
tough day at the office ?
didn &apos;t see you . it could &apos;ve been worse .
that &apos;s good .
so you and rachel .
how long have you guys been dating ?
you know how lawyers and clients work close
over the course of a trial .
when we kicked your ass in the mock trial ,
we , uh , bonded .
you know in the real world
dating clients is a violation of ethics , right ?
good thing it &apos;s not the real world .
&apos;cause i intend to violate those ethics all night .
you know the funny thing ?
i always thought you &apos;d get there first .
i &apos;ll tell you how she is .
shut up , kyle .
someone might think you &apos;re jealous .
someone might think you &apos;re a dick .
oh , wait . somebody already does .
that &apos;s good . you should write that one down .
do you keep a journal of these things ?
finish your tofu .
so how did you two meet ?
i dated his best friend .
i know , it &apos;s awful .
but he was a bad guy , and i didn &apos;t see it .
mike showed me .
the truth is , i--
i think there was always something there with us .
but nothing happened until trevor and i
were totally done .
never ?
well , we did kiss once .
hey , having fun ?
loads . right , mike ?
i think we &apos;re gonna go .
what ? no . we &apos;re having fun .
come on , you don &apos;t want to ruin this .
yeah .
kyle , really , just--
okay , kyle , just--
what ? what &apos;s the problem ?
stop it . she doesn &apos;t like it .
god , that guy is such a tool .
so what ? he &apos;s not your date .
yeah , well , i have to work with him .
that &apos;s not why it bothers you .
it &apos;s because he &apos;s with rachel , and you know it .
oh , my god , jenny . we have been over this .
i &apos;ve seen the way you look at her .
i &apos;ve seen it before .
it &apos;s the way you used to look at me when i was with trevor .
jenny--
i &apos;m going home , mike .
decide what you want . in or out .
i like you .
a lot .
but you can &apos;t have both .
i worked as an assistant district attorney
for the county of new york for two years .
tell me about your relationship with cameron dennis .
vague .
did you and district attorney cameron dennis
work closely together ?
he was my boss . he supervised all my cases .
and were you personally close ?
subjective .
a judge would allow it .
and yet there &apos;s not one here .
do you really think by deposing him on the stand
you &apos;re going to intimidate him ?
i think deposing him here will let him know
what it will be like if this evidence
is brought forward at trial .
you &apos;re not getting to trial .
if your client doesn &apos;t perjure himself right now ,
i won &apos;t have to .
were you and cameron dennis close personally ?
he was my mentor .
it &apos;s a hard relationship to define .
moving on , counselor .
all right .
we don &apos;t have to talk about mr. dennis .
let &apos;s talk about you , mr. specter .
in two years , you handled 18,362 cases .
36 cases a day .
that &apos;s beyond impressive .
thank you .
you took 147 to trial , winning them all .
don &apos;t go to trial if you &apos;re not gonna win .
why &apos;d you leave ?
an attorney by the name of jessica pearson
helped me get through law school ,
and she felt that i could use trial experience .
but i always planned on ending up at her firm
and paying her back by earning that firm
outrageous settlements .
how am i doing ?
you could do better .
you two think that this is a joke .
argumentative .
you &apos;re damn right it &apos;s argumentative .
because he knows that laws have been broken ,
and he has an obligation to report it .
ms. leeds
but if this is the way you want to play it ,
the attorney general has given me
a broad mandate to uncover what went on .
and it need not be limited to mr. dennis .
were you part of the problem , mr. specter ?
vague .
i &apos;ll rephrase .
in your capacity as assistant district attorney
in the county of new york ,
did you knowingly suppress evidence
in violation of the a.v.a. rules of conduct ,
the n.d.a.a. standards ,
and the new york state bar rule 8.4 , section c ?
my client would like to exercise
his fifth @-@ amendment rights at this time .
i hear you botched a settlement
by negotiating against yourself .
i didn &apos;t--
you let louis know the one thing
that was most important to our client .
okay , yes , i made a mistake .
but louis made one too .
well , he didn &apos;t mention that .
yes , he knows what our client wants ,
but now we know the one thing his client wants .
she doesn &apos;t care about winning , harvey .
she just wants our client to lose .
okay , well , that &apos;s good . so what &apos;s next ?
we lose .
we give her the tabloid .
well , how does that make our client happy ?
we let madison have the paper ,
and then we take everyone who works there ,
and we start a new one .
they all love kelsey .
nothing but the truth is just a name .
we let madison have it .
i have taught you a thing or two .
well , i see that you &apos;re up to speed .
well , as am i.
um , i noticed that there were some employee issues at the tabloid .
you know , contracts about to expire .
so i just want to let you guys know
that i went ahead and locked up all the key employees ,
just to protect us ,
since we &apos;re all working on this together , right ?
good .
he knows .
he can &apos;t .
he does .
i was careful .
i deleted every file from the server .
the only time any paper trail left my locked desk
is when i faxed it to kelsey .
you faxed it .
from the large machine that stores all the information you put in it
to be printed back later by anyone who has your code ?
he can &apos;t do that .
we have a chinese wall thing .
oh , god , he &apos;s gonna beat us , isn &apos;t he ?
look , he knows what we &apos;re up to ,
but he couldn &apos;t keep his tactics to himself .
so we can use that against him .
and that &apos;s how we &apos;ll crush louis .
refresher course , harvey .
you and louis aren &apos;t opponents on this one .
you &apos;re working together .
like captain &amp; tennille ?
well , if so , he &apos;s tennille .
who ?
you need to come with me .
what , am i in trouble ?
yeah , harvey . you are .
gonna buy me a drink before you screw me ?
sit down , harvey .
listen to what she has to say .
you got me trembling in my boots .
you &apos;re a small fish ,
and you don &apos;t even swim in the pond anymore .
but if i have to eat you alive to get to cameron dennis ,
i will .
this is my case against him .
falsifying dna tests ,
coerced confessions ,
testimony buried .
you have all this . why do you need me ?
because this is circumstantial .
you have the crimes ,
but you can &apos;t physically tie them to cameron .
he &apos;s a dirty public servant ,
and i think it &apos;s why you left .
your record was too good to just walk away .
maybe i got greedy .
harvey .
i &apos;m not testifying .
you &apos;re being stubborn .
and this isn &apos;t one where you get to make the call .
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;ve done all i can .
it wasn &apos;t just his cases he cheated on .
hector avila .
take a look .
you think you were really that great ?
you think your great track record
was because of your skill ?
i got two theories here , harvey .
either you &apos;re wasting your time protecting a man
who screwed you from the beginning ,
or you didn &apos;t just know he did this ,
you participated ,
in which case i &apos;ll have you disbarred .
come on . come on .
damn it .
what are you doing ?
uh , nothing .
i &apos;m just sending some faxes .
stand down .
they &apos;re stuck , donna . what are you gonna do ?
i &apos;m the fax whisperer .
okay , that &apos;s ridiculous , all right ?
i &apos;ve tried everything .
i &apos;ve hit-- i &apos;ve already done that .
and it didn &apos;t--
whatever .
united international wants to buy the tabloid ?
uh , whatever you do , don &apos;t say anything to louis .
kelsey price does not want to sell .
not a word .
thanks .
whoa . something explode in here ?
just doing some research .
yeah , &apos; cause you always do your own research .
okay , closed @-@ door meeting with donna , with jessica ,
dinner with some d.a. you &apos;ve never even mentioned before .
is this all something cameron dennis taught you ?
keep secrets from everyone because you &apos;re so good ,
you don &apos;t need anyone &apos;s help ?
there &apos;s an investigation into evidence tampering .
i &apos;ve been asked to testify against my old boss ...
or face charges myself .
you could be disbarred .
if i &apos;m found guilty .
are you guilty ?
not of evidence tampering .
i would never do that .
of anything else ?
anything i ever did ,
you put me in front of an unbiased judge ,
i walk away clean .
you put me in a courtroom with a grand jury ,
anything can happen .
so are you gonna testify ?
i &apos;m not sure what choice i have .
well , some dickhead once told me
that when they put a gun to your head ,
it &apos;s not just give in or be killed .
there are 146 other options .
you &apos;ll figure something out .
i &apos;ll have a proposal for you in the morning ,
and i think we &apos;ll all be happy .
all right ?
night .
he took the bait ?
like shooting a fish in a barrel .
good work .
where you going ?
i just might take your advice .
the tides are turning .
you turning with them , harvey ?
they turn you ?
hector avila .
you don &apos;t even know , do you ?
is this some old case ?
it &apos;s my old case , and you buried evidence .
you wearing a wire , harvey ?
no , you &apos;re not .
i can tell .
i &apos;m not that easy to read anymore , cameron .
you are to me .
hector avila .
was he guilty , whoever he was ?
he was my case .
guilty is guilty .
that &apos;s not the way the system works .
the system is broken , and you know it .
it &apos;s not reasonable doubt .
juries want to be sure without a shadow of a doubt .
it was my case .
you worked for me .
they were all my cases .
you &apos;re a disappointment .
no .
you &apos;re the disappointment .
you could &apos;ve been d.a. yourself .
you are twice the lawyer than any of the pricks lined up
to run against me . but you sold out .
you help rich people keep their money . that &apos;s all you do .
i stack my value to society against yours , and i win by a mile .
so you &apos;re selling me out ?
we both know they don &apos;t want to put you in jail .
that &apos;s not what this is about .
walk away , cameron . make a deal .
let someone else be d.a. , and all of this , it goes away .
otherwise ?
you know what happens if you talk .
they start reopening cases .
maybe hector avila walks away .
he murdered once . he &apos;ll murder again .
you do remember him , don &apos;t you ?
oh , i remember &apos; em all .
maxwell rankin ?
what was it , uh , 34 or 35 women that he raped ?
alberto plank ? you remember him ?
he burned his children alive .
you &apos;ll open the floodgates , harvey .
do you want that on your conscience ?
then make a deal .
it &apos;s on you to keep them in jail .
okay .
okay , harvey .
you win .
this isn &apos;t winning .
good to see you , harvey .
let &apos;s do it again soon .
so your client &apos;s really willing to give madison
nothing but the truth ?
you made it clear it was non @-@ negotiable .
i convinced my client to settle .
she wants to move on .
you &apos;re sure there isn &apos;t anything that you want to , uh , disclose ?
nope .
i think we &apos;re good .
then we &apos;re good .
everybody &apos;s happy as clams .
thank you , louis .
you , um ... happy with the deal ?
yeah , as a matter of fact , i am .
you ?
you don &apos;t even know the half of it .
don &apos;t i ?
are you happy that your client got the paper
or that you turned around and sold it ?
oh , you didn &apos;t think i knew about that , did you ?
want to know why i &apos;m happy , louis ?
i &apos;m happy because when you read over that offer
from united international ,
i wanted you to read that .
i wanted you to sell to them .
because the thing you didn &apos;t know
is that yesterday kelsey price bought united international .
you shouldn &apos;t go behind people &apos;s backs , louis .
you shouldn &apos;t try and access information that &apos;s none of your business .
it could backfire .
i think we need to talk to harvey .
i &apos;m sorry , harvey .
you set me up .
no , louis . you set yourself up .
the sales offer was meaningless until you read it .
this is cheating .
you cheated , louis .
you broke the rules , and you have to pay the price .
people may think that lawyers will do anything ,
that they can do anything .
now , i &apos;m not willing to accept that , okay ?
you can &apos;t go skirting the rules and justify it
because you think someone else broke the rules , okay ?
you cheated ! and you lost !
end of story .
harvey , i won .
his playacting by the fax machine was so obvious .
i found out kelsey owned united international ,
and i thought if they wanted the paper so badly ,
how much would they overpay for it ?
50 % .
harvey , you overpaid 50 % for a business
so buried in expenses from the employee deals that i made ,
it can barely stay afloat .
and then all i had to do was convince madison to sit back ,
have fun , watch her sister fail miserably .
i won .
your client got what she wanted .
so did ours .
jessica asked to make everyone happy .
everyone &apos;s happy . it &apos;s a draw .
just hold on a second . you tell me the truth right now .
is this a win to you ?
fine , louis . you win .
you were a step ahead . you got mike . ten days .
you think i &apos;d want him now ?
i just wiped the floor with him .
how can i help you ?
i &apos;m not gonna let him take the fall for that asshole .
have a seat .
harvey didn &apos;t see it for a long time .
i mean , cameron &apos;s good when he wants to be .
you know how i judge a man &apos;s character ?
not by how he treats his equals ,
but by how he treats the underlings .
lowest rungs on the ladder .
you always impressed me in that regard .
thank you .
harvey would never use this ,
and he &apos;d kill me if he knew i had it .
but can you help him ?
can you use this to help him ?
is harvey punishing you for something ?
louis .
no ! you lost ?
you have to work for him ?
i lost , and then he said he didn &apos;t want me .
he farmed me out .
oh , i &apos;m so sorry .
is there anything i can do to help ?
what ?
that .
what are you talking about ?
i wanted you for months . rachel , i flirted .
i @-@ i @-@ i made up some scheme where we were married .
and you made it clear you don &apos;t date anyone from the office .
until i start seeing someone else .
okay , you &apos;re delusional .
why did you bring kyle on that date ?
because it was last @-@ minute
and because you needed me to help convince your girlfriend that you don &apos;t like me .
you did it to get to me .
this is crazy . it &apos;s just stupid .
you don &apos;t even like the guy , rachel .
jenny comes to drop off a suit at the office , and what do you do ?
you kiss me .
you know , i seem to recall you kissing me too .
yeah , that &apos;s the problem .
i did . and it was great .
but it &apos;s too late . you were too late .
and i can &apos;t do any of this .
do what ?
this , this .
this you joking about your first time or--
or rubbing my shoulders or--or touching my arm .
you &apos;re playing with me , and you know it .
what i know is you &apos;re playing with me too .
you kept flirting with me long after you started dating her .
yeah , well , that &apos;s gonna stop .
good .
you know , and while you &apos;re at it ,
no more running to me for favors or asking me for help .
how &apos; bout you find yourself some other paralegal ?
because as far as i &apos;m concerned , we &apos;re done .
uh , can you give us a minute ?
well , jessica .
i &apos;ve spoken to alexandra leeds .
she told me about the deal you cut .
what do you want me to say ?
this is a copy .
i &apos;m driving over to the attorney general &apos;s office right now
if she doesn &apos;t tell me
you &apos;ve cut a new deal by the time i get there ,
she gets the original . and then i give her the proof .
you don &apos;t have the proof .
don &apos;t i ?
cut a new deal .
and if you ever mess with one of mine again ,
alexandra gets that anyway .
you don &apos;t have to testify . they don &apos;t need you anymore .
cameron made a deal ?
he made a deal to sell you out .
but i made my own deal .
he &apos;ll be stepping down , spending some quality time with his family .
how exactly did you manage that ?
not your concern . but you &apos;re in the clear , harvey .
some people would be happy with that news .
that son of a bitch .
clifford danner was 18 .
i put him in jail 12 years ago .
kid &apos;s been rotting in prison his whole adult life .
and ?
he &apos;s innocent .
cameron buried the evidence .
if i &apos;d had it ...
do you have enough to overturn ?
i don &apos;t know .
so what are you going to do ?
