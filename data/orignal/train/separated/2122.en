Male reports that there's a domestic argument
in front of South Seas Sportswear.
Be advised we're receiving
numerous calls on this domestic.
Back at it again, I see.
Three years in a row.
Yeah.
You are such a good dad.
Aw, that's very sweet. Thank you.
You're welcome.
What?
You know that's code for she thinks you're cute.
Yeah, I know that that is, but Tamara's mom
thinks everybody's cute-- that's why she's been
married and divorced three times.
Well, you know what they say:
fourth time's the charm.
What's up, Lou?
What do you say, Danny?
What, uh, what are you doing here?
Well, we're doing a little community service
as penance for someone's recent transgression.
Daddy, I said I was sorry.
Yeah, I remember.
Do yourself a favor. Don't let yours grow up.
No, I don't want her to grow up at all.
Where is your daughter, by the way?
She's, uh...
Oh-oh! Hey, hey! Where are your gloves?
Grace, what did we just talk about?
Put it down.
What are you doing?
Put it in the bag.
Go use a whole bottle of sanitizer, okay?
What do you think's in here?
What do I think's in it? Uh, trash, okay? More trash.
You know, there's some medical waste
over there you can go play with if you're interested.
It's not trash, Danno. I think it's a puzzle.
Can you open it, please?
Of course I can open it.
This doesn't open.
All right, I got an idea.
I'll make a call later tonight.
I'm gonna call Santa Claus and ask him
to bring us one of these with instructions.
I want to see what's inside that one.
Come on. It could be, like,
a gold coin, a treasure map, a letter from someone
stranded on a desert island.
Come on. Don't you want to know?
Don't touch it again, please.
Yeah.
Oh, let me guess. I come pick you up, right?
Thanks.
Thanks.
Guess it's casual Friday.
Must have missed the memo.
Oh, that'd be funny if it wasn't Tuesday.
Annual beach cleanup at Gracie's school.
Right. Which I'd much rather
be spending my Christmas Eve over there
than with a dead guy, all right?
So if we could speed this up, that'd be nice.
Well, in that case. Male vic,
GSW to the head, most likely a nine-millimeter.
Shooter did a pretty good job of covering his tracks.
There's no clothes, obviously. No wallet, no I.D.
Nothing on the vic except the gift wrapping.
Who found this guy?
Fritz over there-- caught a whiff
of our DB in the trunk and alerted the owner.
Well, I, uh, I don't speak dog.
Maybe you want to question him.
Hey, come here, buddy.
Come on. Right here.
Come here. All right, good dog. Look at this.
You know something? You're actually a lot
funnier in short pants, you know that?
Is that right?
Yeah. What about this car?
Owner said it came in three days ago,
but there wasn't body in it when it was inventoried.
Which means that someone must've snuck in and
dumped our vic inside.
Okay, and how'd the shooter get into this place?
A lock was cut on the gate around back. I got CSU
checking it for prints and tool marks right now.
What happens to these cars once they're crushed?
Apparently, they get sent over to China
where they're sold as scrap.
Whoever did this was smart.
I mean, if it wasn't for Fritz here,
this thing would've gone according to plan,
and we would never be investigating this murder.
There goes our holiday.
Hey, Fritz.
Thanks a lot.
Any luck locating Adam in Seattle?
No, but I got a hit off his mother's maiden name
on some recent ATM transactions in Canada.
So I'm going up there to run it down.
You really think Adam could be there?
I don't know, but I gotta check it out.
Be careful, Kono.
Love you guys.
Mele Kalikimaka.
Hey, Max.
Oh, gentlemen, come on in.
You are just in time.
Time for what? A game of Operation?
I would prefer if you would refrain
from making your mildly entertaining witticisms
as this takes complete concentration.
Yeah, no, I know you don't want to make
the buzzer go off, right?
I don't envy you, Commander.
Uh, we get an I.D. on the vic, Max?
Well, I pulled prints and DNA,
and sent them over to the lab.
We are currently waiting for the results.
However, I do have an early Christmas gift for both of you.
I found something intriguing
underneath one of the victim's fingernails.
It's latex, most likely from a glove.
We didn't find any gloves at the scene, Max.
It's possibly a professional requirement.
Maybe he was a surgeon or a dentist.
Or the noblest profession: medical examiner.
Maybe he was using the gloves
'cause he was gonna kill a medical examiner.
Ah, witticism.
There you are, my little friend.
No wonder you were such a challenge to extract.
See the way it's mushroomed like that?
It's a jacketed hollow cavity.
They're designed for rapid expansion
and maximizing tissue damage and blood loss.
Not to mention massive disruption of ballistic evidence,
which means it's unloadable into IBIS.
Okay, our victim's been shot execution style,
a well-planned body dump, and now we got this
highly lethal ammunition that cannot be traced.
I am saying that this is not this guy's first barbecue.
He's done this before.
Fingerprints on our John Doe came back.
He's not in the system.
No, but we did have some luck with his DNA.
Hit came back to 12 unsolved break-ins here on Oahu.
So, this guy's a burglar.
That would explain the latex
that Max found under his fingernails.
I mean, our victim could have been wearing gloves
because he was involved in the commission of a crime.
Police reports indicated that all the burglarized homes
had a security system and hidden safes.
So the guy did his homework.
Definitely a pro. Take a look at this.
He used low-tech items
like a glass cutter, tin foil and silicone
to bypass some very complex alarm systems.
In fact, he was so good at covering his tracks,
that some of the victims didn't even realize they'd been robbed
until days or weeks after they'd been hit.
Maybe could be the burglar surprised a homeowner,
paid for it with his life.
If that was the case, why wouldn't he call the cops
after he shot the guy and claim self-defense?
Why would he dump the body?
I agree with him.
We know our shooter's a pro, right?
So, uh, maybe these guys are in it together.
They, uh... they get into a dispute over some money.
One guy kills the other guy, uh, dumps him in the junkyard.
What are friends for, right?
Wow, someone's cynical.
Yeah, well, that's what happens when you take my
day off away from me. Let's I.D. this guy,
put him in jail
so I can get back to my daughter, please.
Recognize this guy?
No. Who is he?
He is a local burglar who's been hitting
high-end homes all over the island
for the last six months.
Looks dead.
He does look dead. That's very observant.
Um, do you know his name?
Sorry.
Despite of what you may think,
I don't know every undesirable on the island.
But don't you have a computer that does?
Yes, we do.
Uh, we're just doing this for redundancy.
You just snarked yourself out of a favor.
No, please, listen, okay? Just ignore this man
and do this for me, would you, please,
Kamekona? Come on.
Well, there is this Brutha down in North Shore,
owns a pawnshop.
Specializes in hot merch.
Okay, nice.
Talk to him. See what he knows.
Okay? Please.
Shoots.
What are you doing?
Knitting a sweater.
What does it look like I'm doing?
Where'd you get that thing, anyway?
Grace found it on the beach.
You know, you've been playing with it ever
since you got in the car.
It can't be that hard.
Whoa, whoa, what are you doing?
Don't cheat. Why you... why you gotta cheat?
Cheat?
Yeah, cheat.
Show me the rules. Show me where it says I can't do this.
You know what?
This is just pathetic.
Give it to me.
What are you going to do with it?
I'm gonna open it.
Oh, you think? Okay.
Go ahead, "Houdini." You need this?
No, I don't need that.
Very nice.
You know, uh... you know what you are?
Yeah, smarter than you.
Nope, that's...
Smarter than you.
that's not what I was gonna say.
You're welcome, by the way.
What is that?
Where'd you say that beach cleanup was again?
Ki'i Dunes.
You know there's been, uh,
tsunami debris washing up in that area recently, right?
From the Japanese tsunami?
That was, what, three years ago now?
Little box.
Big ocean.
I'd say it could've taken that long to get here.
*Tiny bubbles*
*In the wine*
*Makes me happy*
*Makes me feel fine*
*Tiny bubbles*
*Make me warm all over*
What are you, uh... what are you doing?
"Tiny Bubbles."
Written by Leon Pober.
Released by Don Ho in 1966.
Ah, and butchered by you here in 2013.
I liked it.
"Butchered..." This is for you, brah.
What is it?
Cost of doing business.
No. This is... this-this is $300.
What do you.... $300 for a ukulele?
That's koa wood, brah.
And good information does not come cheap.
Especially during the holiday season.
Wow. You actually have a wallet.
I got $80, all right?
That's all I got.
Figures.
Here, you thief.
$220 more.
North Shore Brutha hooked us up
with the name of your dead thief.
Victor Dobbs.
Word is, worked strictly big scores.
Mostly diamonds and jewelry.
Victor Dobbs.
Currently unemployed.
Last job...
He was a manager at the Wailana Electronics Supply Company.
Well, with his background,
that's how he could've learned how to bypass a security system.
It didn't teach him how to dodge a bullet, though, did it?
Looks like he lived alone.
How ironic.
Sorry. Wrong house.
Hey! Show me your hands. Behind your head.
Interlock your fingers.
Easy, man.
Aren't you a little early, Santa?
We checked out that laptop
that Danny found in our vic's place.
These right here were taken inside the homes
that our burglar already hit, and these over here,
these were part of his wish list.
What, these are places, uh, Dobbs cased
and was intending to rob?
That's right and wrong.
These were places he was going to hit,
but he didn't do the casing.
That was all done by our guest, Tim Sapoli.
We got a hit off his prints.
He's got multiple priors.
Did some time in Halawa.
He's currently employed as a cable TV installer.
And it looks like he's our victim's partner.
How do we know that?
Because he's the one who e-mailed
those photos to Victor Dobbs.
Let's cut to the chase and talk about
what happened with Dobbs, okay?
I'm thinking it was about money.
Maybe he wasn't paying you enough.
Maybe you wanted to renegotiate the terms of your deal
with him and it went south.
Uh, I'm guessing that's why you killed him.
What?
What are you talking about?
Dobbs is dead?
What? You think I killed him?
We think you put a bullet in him,
dumped the body,
then broke into his house
and tried to steal the computer
so that you wouldn't be linked to the photos.
Listen, okay?
The burglaries?
Fine.
I helped pull those off.
But murder? No way.
I didn't kill Dobbs.
You're going to have to do better than that.
I haven't seen him for days.
We were supposed to meet up after the last score,
split the take... - What score?
I don't know.
My job was to feed him the leads,
but he never told me
which house he was gonna hit.
So, what? He just didn't show up for the split?
Nope.
Never showed.
I kept calling him, but he wasn't answering.
I figured something must've happened.
I don't know, maybe he pulled the plug...
Maybe he got arrested.
I never figured he'd get himself killed.
You really expect us to believe that?
Why would I want my partner dead?
Dobbs was my meal ticket.
So, what... you believe him?
Well, first of all, Sapoli's got no alibi.
Second of all, we caught him breaking into
the victim's house to destroy evidence.
So do I believe him? No, I don't believe him.
But until we get something solid on this guy,
all we got is a burglary charge.
My guys finished searching your suspect Sapoli's place.
They found a weapon...
Glock nine-mil.
That's the same caliber used to kill Dobbs.
Yeah. I'm running it against the slug
that Max found, but it's so degraded,
it's a long shot.
But even if we get a match,
we still have to put him at the crime scene.
If we could find it.
Okay, well, given the latex found
under Dobbs' fingernail, he might have been killed
right after his last burglary.
So if we can figure out where that was,
we can canvass the neighborhood,
maybe turn up a witness or a security cam
that puts Sapoli in the area around the time of death.
The problem is, there were no burglaries
reported last night.
All right, well, maybe, uh... homeowners were out of town.
Well, considering the skill of your burglar,
these people might not even know they're victims yet.
Catherine, pull up Dobbs's wish list...
all the houses he was targeting.
I can take it one step further and create a map.
Okay.
Chin, Cath,
split up these addresses, go door-to-door,
see if any of these places were hit last night.
You got my guys, too, if you need 'em.
Thank you.
Charlie, what do you got?
I managed to reconstruct the bullet Max removed from your victim.
There was enough land and groove impressions for me to determine
that the round was fired by a Browning.
No, no. The, uh, gun HPD recovered from Sapoli's house
was a Glock... - Was a Glock.
Which could mean your suspect
shot the victim using a different gun.
Or he wasn't the killer.
I also processed the tarp
that your victim's body was found wrapped in.
Contacted the manufacturer.
Production was discontinued six years ago,
so I'm trying to narrow down what retailers sold them.
As soon as I can put together a list of transaction records,
I'll call you.
All right, mahalo.
Give me one minute, alright?
Go.
Hey, Charlie.
I know you got plenty to do,
but, um, my daughter found this, uh, on the beach.
Thought maybe you'd take a look at it.
It's a puzzle box.
Got significant water damage.
Yeah.
I... looks like it's been in the water for a couple years.
I was thinking that maybe it, uh,
it washed up here from the tsunami in Japan.
It's quite possible.
If you get any time, please, uh, look at it.
It means a lot to Grace.
And you.
Yes. Uh, and me. Look.
A lot of people died in that tsunami, Charlie,
and, uh... this little girl here, uh,... I can only assume
she meant a lot to somebody, so I'd like
to find out what happened to her, that's all.
I'll do my best.
Just checked the sixth house off my list.
Nothing yet. How are you making out?
I've hit four. Got nothing.
Four?
To my six?
Aren't you the one driving around in a muscle car?
Hey, you saw my list.
My houses cover a wider area than yours.
Okay, then.
What do you say the last person
who gets to the bottom of their list
picks up the next tab at Side Street?
You're on.
Hi. Can I help you?
Aloha.
I'm Lieutenant Kelly. I'm with Five-O.
Gary Nathan. What can I do for you?
Well, Mr. Nathan, we're investigating
a rash of break-ins in the area.
We have reason to believe
that your home has been targeted.
Are you serious?
Did you have any cable or Internet work done here recently?
Yeah.
Uh, a few weeks ago,
I had a new Wi-Fi system installed.
But what does that have to do with being robbed?
Our suspects are using service calls
to access people's homes.
A lot of our victims don't even know
that they've been burglarized until days
or weeks after the fact.
Mind if I take a look around?
It'll only take a couple of minutes.
Oh, of course, yeah. Whatever you need.
Thanks.
Nice place.
How long you been here?
Couple years.
Before that?
Denver.
We used to vacation in Hawaii when I was a kid,
so when the opportunity came up, I moved here.
Denver, huh? You a skier?
Used to be.
If you ever get the urge, you ought to try Mauna Kea.
It's on Hawai'i Island.
Actually snows there a couple times a year.
Locals call it, uh... pineapple powder.
I'll have to check that out.
Mind if I take a look at your wall safe?
How did you know I have a wall safe?
As part of the investigation, we confiscated photos
of the homes that were cased.
And as I mentioned earlier, yours was targeted.
Yes, you did say that.
It's over here.
Here we go.
Did the safe come with the house?
No, I had it installed.
I'm gonna need you to open it up.
Excuse me?
I just need you to verify that everything's accounted for.
Oh. I don't need to see what's inside.
All right.
Of course.
All good.
Okay, you can close it back up.
What is it?
It's tinfoil.
Ah, probably a gum wrapper.
Burglars use tinfoil to bypass security systems.
Well, at least your prowler has uptown taste.
All his targets are in affluent areas.
We can forget about pawnshops.
This merch is being moved through a local fence.
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Commander McGarrett? Detective Williams?
That's right. This is Captain Grover.
How can we help you? Ma'am.
Special Agent Rebecca Conway, FBI.
How do you do?
HPD Crime Lab ran a search
that flagged a case I'm working.
Specifically, the tarp and firearm information
that was entered linked to a series of murders that I'm covering.
Our suspect's killed 14 people that we know of.
12 on the mainland, two in Hawaii.
You're saying we have a serial killer on the Island?
Why are we hearing about this now?
We've been after this guy for long time.
Didn't want to scare him into the wind.
And you think we're chasing the same guy?
I'm not totally convinced,
but that's why I'm here: to compare notes.
What do you got?
In every case, our suspect holds the victims
for less than 24 hours.
All are bound and tortured.
The C.O.D. is always the same:
a single gunshot wound to the head
using nine-millimeter jacketed hollow cavity bullets.
We think this is a mercy killing
after the horrific abuse that he inflicts.
So you're sure that the killer's male?
The kind of atrocities
associated with this killer seem to be
a function of masculine traits.
Particularly the way he disposes of the bodies;
he's very practical.
He strips the victims of their clothing,
wraps them in a plastic tarp
and dumps them in random locations.
The killer also likes to cut a single finger
from each victim's hand, which he keeps as a souvenir.
So he can relive
the fantasy at a later date, right?
Right. Now, what I can't figure out
is that up until this point,
all the victims have been females in their 20s,
most likely targeted for those specific traits.
Your victim is male.
And he's not missing a finger.
Right.
But other than that, the M.O. fits.
I'm just not sure why my guy picked Mr. Dobbs.
Maybe your guy didn't pick Mr. Dobbs.
Maybe Mr. Dobbs picked him.
What do you mean?
We know Dobbs was a burglar.
We also know that he pulled a job the night he was killed, okay?
Now, what if he was in the middle of that job
when this went down?
You're saying he broke into the killer's house.
So that means
that he didn't choose to change his M.O.,
but your victim forced him to.
What I'm saying is it's possible.
Do you have an address?
We have people out in the field working on that right now.
Pull them back. Do it now.
If this guy knows he's cornered,
he's going to run or do what he does best,
which is take another life.
Hey, Steve.
Leilani, you alright?
Yeah. I'm sorry. Um, I've been trying to reach Chin.
We were supposed to meet a couple hours ago.
Have you heard from him?
He's not answering.
If there's something wrong, please tell me.
Hold on.
Cath, Catherine, where are you?
Pearl City. Why? What's going on?
Have you heard from Chin?
No, not recently.
Why?
Okay, okay, listen to me very carefully.
I need you to stand down.
HPD's gonna hit the rest of the houses on that list.
Do me a favor. Call your people, okay?
Tell them we've lost contact with one of ours.
We're gonna need all the help we can get.
You know, there are cops all over this neighborhood.
They're gonna find me.
You know, I don't know what it is you think you're doing, Gary...
but as far as I'm concerned,
all you did was kill somebody who broke into your house.
You know, a jury might look at that as self-defense,
but if you kill me, you're gonna die in prison.
You understand that, right?
Are you hearing me?
Think about it.
You know nothing.
You see now?
You know nothing.
Do you see me?
Yes.
I see you, Gary.
I see you for who you really are.
You're above us all.
You're a living deity.
You control who lives and who dies.
You're lying!
You think I'm a monster.
You're right.
I think you're a sick, pathetic little worm
who preys on innocent women for your degenerate needs!
My only question for you...
Why women?
What did they do to you, Gary? Huh?
What do they represent?
Or maybe it's one in particular,
and you just take it out on total strangers.
What, your mommy hurt you?
Maybe she locked you up in a closet when you were a little kid.
Maybe you had a thing for her, huh?
Maybe, but she was always Daddy's, right?
You're mine.
I control you.
Just like all the others.
People like you, you think you're so smart
that you know what's inside me,
but you don't know and you never will.
You can't possibly imagine
what a great pleasure it is to have you as my guest.
Gary?
Don't go anywhere.
Gary?
I heard someone here needs soup.
Emily, hi. Didn't you get my message?
I ignored it,
like any good girlfriend would when her man says he's sick.
Oxtail soup from Pho Bistro.
Your favorite.
Oh, wow, you feel a little feverish to me.
Yeah, you know, I think you're right,
and the last thing you need is to get sick,
so maybe you should just leave the soup and go.
Don't worry, if I get sick, then you'll just take care of me.
Look what you made me do.
Yeah. Grover. What do you got?
Really?
All right, thanks. Wait, hang on, hang on.
That was the impound yard--
they got a car there that's registered
to your murder victim, Victor Dobbs.
It was towed there from
a "No overnight parking" spot in Kahala Park.
Okay, wait, there's a house on Dobbs' list
two blocks from there, uh, Moa Street.
All right, forget this place.
Catherine, do me a favor. Call Agent Conway.
Have her meet us on site.
Gary, what are you doing?
It's not you. It's me.
No, no!
Chin!
Chin!
Chin!
You all right?
Huh? Yeah.
Thanks.
I wanted to be the one to pull the trigger.
Be glad you didn't.
It's over.
You should let those families know.
You ever finish your sweep?
Almost. You?
I got a little distracted.
Okay, you know what?
Let's call it a tie.
A tie?
No, I say a tie goes to the guy who got stabbed in the shoulder.
Don't you think?
Sympathy play. Okay.
I'm sold. Dinner's on me. Ooh, all right.
Oh, you buying?
Yeah.
Who invited you?
This Grinch act of yours, just-just stop it.
You know you like me.
You just have difficulty expressing your feelings.
I don't know how he feels about you,
but he definitely likes a free meal. That I know.
What's that supposed to mean?
Well, I don't want to put a fine point on it, but you are cheap.
Look, in three years, when was
the last time you picked up a check?
Everything's about money with you. You're obsessed with money.
This specifically, yes, it's about money.
See, when the bill comes, what you have to do
is you have to reach in your pocket,
take the lock off your wallet, take out the green paper--
it's called money -- and
you pay for the bill. That's how it works.
The meal after next, I'll pay for everybody.
What do you mean, meal after... Why meal after next?
How 'bout that?
Catherine just clearly said she's paying for this meal.
Right?
Catherine.
Where'd she go?
Putz.
She just said it, Danny.
Catherine!
Mele Kalikimaka.
Ho ho ho.
Ho ho ho!
Huh?
Yeah!
Weight down. Weight down. Whack it in.
Come on. Let's go.
Everybody goes completely nuts.
The entire East Coast loses their mind. Huh?
Hey. Practice.
Please be careful, all right?
What's up, buddy?
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas, Danny.
What are you doing here?
I couldn't sleep.
Oh. What, uh... what'd you find out?
I recovered a hair from inside the locket.
Extracted DNA and ran the profile
against a database the Japanese police
set up to help identify victims of the tsunami.
What'd you find?
The little girl in the photo was six-year-old Akiko Tanaka.
She lived with her family in Ishinomaki,
one of the towns hardest hit by the tsunami.
I contacted the girl's father,
the family's only survivor.
He was away on business when the quake hit.
Tried to get back in time,
but was forced back by the wave.
When the water receded,
it was all gone:
his wife, daughter, house.
His whole life was wiped out in a matter of minutes.
You, uh... you said you spoke to this guy.
Where-where is he now?
Excuse me. Hi.
Do you know where I can find a Mr. Tanaka?
あそこ。
Okay. Thanks.
Come on.
何か。
Come on.
Excuse me.
You, uh, Mr. Tanaka?
はい。 何か。
I, uh... I think this belongs to you.
ありがとうございます。
You're welcome.
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas to you, too.
