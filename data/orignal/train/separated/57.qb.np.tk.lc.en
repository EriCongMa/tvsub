baby did a bad , bad thing ?
baby did a bad , bad thing
it was e @-@ mailed to campus inboxes .
do you know who sent it ?
my guess is tau kappa theta , the jewish fraternity .
i &apos;m not saying anything bad .
no , of course not .
i just think it was this video
that provoked the fight at the interfaith rally .
and you want us to defend ... ?
jimal mifsud .
scholarship student in science .
his family is in jiddah , and he can &apos;t afford a lawyer .
do you know his family ?
no ,
i am purely an interested bystander here
who wants to see justice done .
purely ?
there &apos;s a campus fistfight between a dozen palestinian and jewish youths ,
and the state &apos;s attorney only charges one palestinian ?
well , he doesn &apos;t have a record ,
so it should be a simple misdemeanor battery .
court supervision , at most .
no , the new state &apos;s attorney wants to appear tough on his first day .
it was deemed a hate crime .
seven years .
alicia ,
meet wasim al @-@ said , an old friend
who until recently retained our competitor young , bachman and meyers
for his legal interest .
to my eternal regret .
very nice to meet you , mrs. florrick .
alicia &apos;s fine .
your husband was very good
to the muslim community in his first term .
my fear is , that &apos;s changed .
of course , alicia can &apos;t influence her husband in any way ,
but she is still one of our best lawyers .
well , that &apos;s all jimal needs .
this is a good kid they &apos;re painting as a suicide bomber .
bond hearing &apos;s today . i &apos;ll be there .
good , that &apos;s one piece of business .
what else might we handle that young , bachman and meyers can &apos;t ?
i know that eli gold is working with you these days ?
i &apos;m in need of some crisis management .
what &apos;s the crisis ?
where &apos;s the management ?
will you get , uh , eli for us ?
and ask will to step in .
will ? sure .
he &apos;s late . overslept .
must be from celebrating yesterday &apos;s victory .
must be .
hey , mom , pick up the phone . hey , mom , pick up ...
hello , dearest daughter .
you sound happy .
i am happy .
i have my daughter on the phone . what more could i desire ?
look , i don &apos;t think i need a tutor .
grace , we discussed this . it &apos;s just a month .
yeah , but it was one report card .
and it &apos;s one month .
dad just thinks i need to apply myself .
oh , i agree , and a tutor will help you do that .
eli ? the meeting .
mom , nisa &apos;s parents want you to come over for dinner .
you and dad . both of you .
why ?
just to be nice . i didn &apos;t tell them anything .
it was like you said ;
i haven &apos;t let anyone know you guys are separated .
okay , i &apos;ll talk to your father about it . i @-@ i &apos;ve got to go .
so , who is this guy again ?
wasim al @-@ said .
he &apos;s a commodities trader .
wasim ?
diane &apos;s been trying to sign him for two years .
he has ten million in charitable assets to spend .
on what ?
a campaign against anti @-@ muslim bigotry .
mr. al @-@ said , you do know that i &apos;m not a pr specialist .
i handle lobbying and crisis management .
do you watch the evening news , eli ?
religiously .
then you know there was a murder
of a jewish poli sci major at chicago polytech last night .
unsolved , but the police are questioning muslim students .
ten minutes later , a riot broke out at the other end of campus
at a rally intended to encourage interfaith dialogue ,
and only one muslim was arrested .
now i &apos;m used to reading the tea leaves in this country ,
and the best way to manage a crisis is before it becomes one .
isn &apos;t that true ?
it is .
so , are you hiring me because i &apos;m good or because i &apos;m jewish ?
because i imagine it might look quite good
having a jew campaign for muslims .
can &apos;t it be both ?
i don &apos;t like being used .
really ? since when ?
he knows jewish money is going to peter for his next campaign
and he wants to buy influence .
and ... ?
don &apos;t you get so knowing on me .
what &apos;s up with you , anyway ?
you seem different .
where you going ?
court .
why ?
i &apos;m a lawyer .
okay , glad we cleared that up .
this is a hate crime , your honor ,
and we ask that bail be set at $ 100,000 .
have you ever been in a fistfight , counselor ?
have i , your honor ? no .
well , let me educate you .
it &apos;s chaos , chaos in there . no one can tell who hits who .
fists are flying , you get hit in the head .
the next thing you know ,
you &apos;re on the ground and somebody &apos;s jumping on top .
jimal , i &apos;m sorry to be late .
i was ...
jimal assaulted someone because he was jewish .
that is not chaos , your honor .
and jimal was hit because he &apos;s palestinian , your honor .
alicia florrick , your honor .
20 students were fighting .
only one was charged . one muslim .
his religion had nothing to ...
it had everything to do with it .
all right , okay , your passion is preserved for the record .
bond is set at $ 5,000 .
and i do suggest that the state reconsider its charge .
thank you , your honor .
jimal , i was just put in on this .
you have a benefactor who asked me to step in .
are you all right ?
yeah , but i didn &apos;t do anything .
i know , a lot of this is posturing by the prosecution
to get you to accept a higher plea .
the good news is , the judge is on your side .
now , do you want me to call your parents or anything ?
no , no they wouldn &apos;t ... look , i &apos;m ashamed .
i understand . hopefully , we can handle this by admitting simple battery .
but i didn &apos;t ... i wasn &apos;t even there .
he wasn &apos;t at the rally , cary . he was at the library .
oh , my god , really ? that &apos;s terrible .
this isn &apos;t about jimal ,
and this isn &apos;t about some stupid fistfight .
this is about that jewish kid stabbed to death ,
and you can &apos;t find the killer so jimal is the scapegoat .
we have an eyewitness who saw jimal throw the first punch .
that &apos;s what this is about .
is the eyewitness caucasian ?
oh , wow , how quickly we slip the bonds of political correctness .
why not ask if he &apos;s jewish ?
cross @-@ racial identification .
caucasians have difficulty discerning unique characteristics .
six months in county , one year probation .
no .
then i &apos;ll see you in court .
tell peter there has to be a better way
to firm up his campaign contributions .
using everything we can , are we ?
it &apos;s a new day .
we &apos;re running a clean office .
let me say that again , because
we &apos;re all prone to the same cynicism .
we ... are running a clean office .
clean , ethical , honest , but not weak .
i know our budgets have been slashed .
i know we &apos;re the underdog here .
but our strategy will be this :
no plea bargains .
that &apos;s right .
defense attorneys will be expecting the opposite .
so for the next two months ,
i want you to hold the line on every single plea .
after that , you won &apos;t have to work as hard .
you get your enemy flinching ,
you &apos;ll never have to hit him hard again .
your first complaint will be about investigator hours .
that &apos;s why i &apos;ve hired an outside contractor
until we can budget full time .
i want you to meet sophia russo .
she &apos;s good , and she &apos;s cheap .
thanks !
relatively .
mr. florrick , i offered the defense six months
on the college hate crime . should i walk it back ?
what &apos;s the law say ?
three to seven years .
there &apos;s your answer .
the lawyer &apos;s alicia ,
and she might come after your campaign contributions .
really ?
yeah . what do you want ?
follow the law .
you can &apos;t go wrong if you follow the law .
all right .
geez , what a pit .
thank you .
you &apos;re working on the , uh ,
the jewish @-@ muslim thing , right ?
yeah , the hate crime . why ? what do you need ?
oh , it &apos;s not what i need .
what is this ?
you used to work with kalinda sharma , didn &apos;t you ?
yeah .
if i were you , i &apos;d slip it to her .
so , kind of odd not seeing you around much .
yeah , i &apos;ve been busy .
yeah .
and here i thought you didn &apos;t need me anymore .
what &apos;s that ?
it &apos;s a peace offering .
peter florrick wants to run a clean office , so ...
this is me being clean .
you &apos;re welcome .
you can &apos;t make chicagoans feel good about islam with pathos .
you need to go positive .
link the arab spring to the american revolution .
who is the islamic george washington ?
who is the islamic paul revere ?
morning in the middle east ...
do you need something ?
it &apos;s on your desk . it &apos;s self @-@ explanatory .
that &apos;s your car ?
good . now , i know you said you were at the library .
but the time code on that traffic light
shows that the driver of your car was running
a red light just outside the campus gates
at the exact moment of the interfaith rally .
that means that the driver of your car , if that is you ,
couldn &apos;t have been involved in the rally fight .
do you understand ?
i do .
so , i want you to take your time before you answer .
is that you driving your car ?
it is .
are you certain , young man ?
it &apos;s a very roundabout way to come from the library .
i &apos;m sure .
we ask that mr. mifsud state under oath
that he was the driver in this photo
which we will mark as people &apos;s exhibit # 1 .
your honor , is that really necessary ?
it &apos;s the only way we &apos;ll drop the hate charge .
very well . mr. mifsud , you are under oath .
do you swear that that &apos;s you in the photo ?
yes .
good . well , i think that just about , uh , wraps it up ,
doesn &apos;t it , mr. agos ? i &apos;m late for the gym .
it does , your honor , and the state has made a terrible
mistake in charging mr. mifsud with this battery .
but this car with this license plate
was seen racing away from the scene of the frat murder of simon greenberg
objection , your honor !
that is why he ran the red light .
oh , this is outrageous .
he had just killed simon greenberg .
this is prosecutorial misconduct .
he swore to it .
his alibi means he committed this murder .
because you overcharged him with a hate crime
so he would grab at any alibi .
so you &apos;re saying your client perjured himself ?
no , i am saying he took my advice , that &apos;s all .
well , then congratulations , alicia .
you just advised your client to admit to murder .
your honor ,
the people charge jimal mifsud with first @-@ degree murder .
alicia dropped by for you .
why ?
i don &apos;t know . you want me to get her ?
no . later .
so this isn &apos;t you ?
it &apos;s your car , but you &apos;re not driving it ?
i &apos;m sorry , i , uh , i thought it was the easiest way out .
so who is it ? who &apos;s driving it ?
i don &apos;t know .
jimal , they have a witness who swears that that car--
your car-- was driven away by simon greenberg &apos;s killer .
so don &apos;t cover for anyone .
i &apos;m not covering .
my @-@ my two roommates don &apos;t have a car ,
i let amir and tariq use mine .
i just leave my keys in the room .
so which is driving it , amir or tariq ?
i don &apos;t know .
but he swore that was him driving away from the murder ?
he didn &apos;t know it would implicate him in a murder .
it &apos;s my fault .
i encouraged him to place himself in the car
to give him an alibi from the hate crime .
yes . and now i have a multimillion @-@ dollar client
thinking that we &apos;re amateurs .
i got the pictures from the asa &apos;s office .
i should &apos;ve checked .
great . it &apos;s everybody &apos;s fault .
now let &apos;s make it right .
i &apos;m questioning jimal &apos;s roommates .
one of them is the real driver .
and i &apos;m filing a motion to dismiss
jimal &apos;s alibi statement during preliminary .
i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on with you two ,
but make it better .
whatever you have to do .
make it better .
so are we supposed to do something ?
sure .
what subject ?
i don &apos;t know .
you &apos;re the tutor .
what does your mom want ?
she wants me to get better grades ,
so that i &apos;ll get into briarcrest .
you don &apos;t like public school ?
no , i do .
it &apos;s just that there was a mugging on the field ,
and all the parents got really scared .
is this your first job tutoring ?
yeah .
how am i doing ?
not so good .
darn .
can we go outside ?
yeah , i think it &apos;s up to you .
cary the man !
throwing down that opposition .
nicely played .
thanks .
so this is the new cary ?
no , just a new day .
so can i see the crime scene photos , cary ?
well , come on .
you &apos;re in the big leagues now . what can it hurt ?
i &apos;ll think about it .
well , look who &apos;s here .
sophia ?
in the flesh .
strange bedfellows , huh ?
the strangest .
well ...
you two have a nice time .
what &apos;d she want ?
crime scene photos .
damn it .
okay , uh , simon greenberg , 22,
found in his dorm room gagged ,
hands bound , stabbed 45 times .
little overkill ?
yep .
police think it was an execution .
no sign of a struggle .
any witnesses ?
neighbor heard a scream ,
looked out his window and saw a dark ,
possibly black middle eastern man running to his car .
they got a number plate-- et27 .
damn .
that &apos;s not a partial plate .
yeah , i know .
jimal &apos;s plate .
um , one other thing .
something that wasn &apos;t released to the press .
what ?
killer drew a swastika
with the victim &apos;s blood .
yep . i know this is not looking good , is it ?
okay , um ,
let me know what you get from the roommates .
got it .
oh , by the way , the swastika
- the police don &apos;t know why , but it was drawn backwards .
okay .
am i interrupting ?
nope .
how are you ?
good .
do you have a moment to talk ?
about last night ?
yeah .
don &apos;t act like this is nothing , eli .
you &apos;re running a pro @-@ palestinian campaign .
it &apos;s an anti- muslim @-@ bigotry campaign ,
and i am a crisis man ...
you are a jew .
we are both ...
oh , come on , michael !
what is this ?
ultimate frisbee ?
we only win by making them lose ?
yes .
you act like you &apos;re not paying attention ,
but i know you &apos;re paying attention .
this is a pr war .
and i &apos;m a traitor ?
in february , israeli soldiers
helped a palestinian woman give birth .
you didn &apos;t read about it unless you subscribed
to the israel national news .
two days later , an israeli woman
gave birth in a palestinian hospital .
where did you read it ? ap , cbs news , every major paper .
google it . go ahead .
this is a pr war and they are winning .
michael .
i do not go to your house
and tell you what novels to write .
i do not go to your committee
and tell you what lobbyists to hire .
that &apos;s it .
now i get it .
i didn &apos;t hire you .
there it is .
i hired tarkovsky &amp; associates .
with a $ 20 million jewish league fund to fight intolerance .
yes , you did .
so this isn &apos;t israel / palestine to you .
it &apos;s gold versus tarkovsky .
you &apos;re paying a competitor , michael .
and as moved as i am by your plea for jewish brotherhood ,
i &apos;m not that moved .
4,000 years and we are always our own worst enemy .
so you were driving jimal &apos;s car that night , right ?
this is just like the cops .
racist .
they think an arab had to do it .
yeah , but this is you , isn &apos;t it , amir ?
you were driving your roommate &apos;s car that night , right ?
no .
and you know why it &apos;s not me ?
look at your time code , lady .
i was in my living room for salah .
evening prayers .
anybody else see you there ?
yes .
who ?
the prophet muhammad .
peace be upon him .
yeah , amir &apos;s in the living room five times a day praying .
okay , tariq .
did you see him praying on the night of the murder ?
no .
so you were home ?
you were home to be able to not see him there ?
no , i was out .
in jimal &apos;s car ?
no , i wanted to take it , but the keys were gone already .
so where were you ?
i was here .
in the quad at the interfaith rally .
sophia .
kalinda .
hi .
i didn &apos;t see you over there .
this is how you investigate these days ?
by just following me ?
yep .
makes things a lot easier .
so you and cary , huh ?
that &apos;s why you &apos;ve been ignoring me , right ?
it &apos;s not because i &apos;m married .
yep . you got me .
listen , i &apos;m gonna go and question eyewitnesses at the jewish frat .
do you want the address ?
where &apos;s the fun in that ?
your honor , this is ...
this is prosecutorial misconduct .
okay , okay , okay .
this is absolutely unethical .
all right , all right .
each to your corners .
mrs. florrick , your client
already swore that that was him in the car .
is he now trying to say that he lied ?
he &apos;s saying that he was misled by the prosecution .
how did i mislead ?
jimal was given an opportunity
to avoid a hate crime prosecution and he took it ,
that &apos;s all .
this murder charge is based on nothing else .
there &apos;s no evidence that jimal and the victim even knew each other .
where &apos;s the motive ?
mr. greenberg was jewish and jimal was muslim ,
and as you can see here , your honor ,
a swastika was drawn on the victim &apos;s ...
oh , come on .
anti @-@ semitism
isn &apos;t some cookie cutter motive you can apply to any dark @-@ skinned ...
all right , counselors , listen .
nobody likes a street fight better than me ,
but that &apos;s for in the street , not here .
mr. agos , do you have any further probable cause ?
because if it &apos;s just that statement ,
i am prone to overturn .
we do , your honor .
professor noah fineman .
i teach political science .
and did the accused show a particular interest in one of your lectures ?
he did .
it &apos;s a lecture that i give on the anniversary of 9 / 11
about chickens who come home to roost
for the united states and zionist regime in israel ...
objection .
your honor , is mr. agos really trying
to find a motive in jimal &apos;s classes ?
why not home ec ?
maybe that &apos;s where the knife came from .
overruled . i think we can stand a bit
of rough and tumble here , counselor .
so , professor ,
you would argue that israel &apos;s a criminal regime .
oh , i @-@ i don &apos;t argue it .
i think that &apos;s fairly self @-@ evident .
given this , what do you think of suicide bombings
and the death of jewish citizens ?
if you &apos;re asking me if i approve of such a thing , no , never .
but i do understand them .
these are understandable movements
against a zionist oppression .
and how did your student jimal
take an added interest in this lecture ?
well , he was , uh , very engaged in class , yes .
and afterwards , he approached me
to ask me questions about my newest book ,
zionist occupation : the need for realignment and new thinking .
bordinay press .
thank you , professor .
no further questions , your honor .
actually , professor ,
i have a few questions .
my client was very engaged in your lecture , you said ?
how did you witness this ?
well , if you teach students long enough , you get a sense .
and for how long did you teach jimal ?
well , it &apos;s been four weeks since the beginning of the semester .
so four weeks , that &apos;s , uh , 20 sessions .
and for how many of those sessions were you actually present ?
i don &apos;t understand .
how many of those 20 sessions were you actually there teaching
and not having one of your ta &apos;s do it ?
uh ... didn &apos;t you only lecture the class twice , professor ?
well , i would question your use of the word &quot; only , &quot;
but , uh ...
yes .
and yet you really focused with your laser @-@ like perception
on jimal and his engagement .
you &apos;re being a bit rude .
yes , and i &apos;m just getting started .
so , after one of your lectures ,
jimal came to you to ask you about your book .
how do you know this ?
because i keep a record next to my attendance . see ?
that asterisk tells me that i must send them
an e @-@ mail about my book .
and , of course , you recognize jimal , over there ?
oh , yes .
this record attendance ,
the students sign themselves in , yes ?
yes , it &apos;s a very efficient way to work .
i &apos;m sure .
do you see jimal &apos;s name there ?
it &apos;s him there .
that &apos;s not his handwriting .
objection .
that &apos;s the handwriting of his roommate ,
tariq , also a student in your class who signed him in
so that jimal could cut class .
well , i &apos;d say things have been pretty easy for you up until now .
really ?
how &apos;s that ?
in court , these people don &apos;t really know how you think .
but you do ?
hate to tell you this but we &apos;re going to beat you .
good luck with that .
battle m.e. gaza strip
it &apos;s one of my best mmogs .
and what is an mmog ?
massive multiplayer online game .
meaning people log onto their computers
and battle each other .
yep .
what are we looking at now ?
uh , well , that &apos;s the recorded actions of sampson5 .
that &apos;s the avatar of the accused , jimal ...
objection .
your honor ,
what does this have to do with the death of simon greenberg ?
goes to motive , your honor .
what is that assault weapon over there , is that an uzi ?
no , it &apos;s a galil 5.56 .
what &apos;s the range of fire ?
450 meters .
cool .
proceed .
well , that &apos;s jimal &apos;s avatar there .
the guy running .
and what is he wearing ?
oh , that ? that &apos;s a suicide vest .
he &apos;s wearing a suicide vest ?
and what is he entering ?
that &apos;s a civilian israeli building .
that &apos;s a school , in fact ...
your honor , this is a game .
mr. al @-@ said was just here .
he wants us to pull out of jimal &apos;s defense .
he is afraid defending a youth who makes light of a suicide bombing
will undercut eli &apos;s pro @-@ muslim campaign .
he wasn &apos;t making light of it .
he was playing a video game .
in which he killed a schoolhouse full of kids .
yes , but in a video game .
have you seen video games lately ?
we can &apos;t abandon jimal .
he was looking at misdemeanor battery .
we helped him into a murder charge .
&quot; we &quot; ?
i ... helped him into a murder charge ,
which i did as a representative of this firm .
we made a commitment to him .
what do you think ?
i think your friend will pull out of eli &apos;s campaign
and go right back to his old firm with his $ 10 million .
yeah .
still , retail rules .
we broke it , we own it ?
okay , we &apos;ll stick with jimal .
win this one .
no .
no , what ?
no , mr. al @-@ said .
i &apos;m coming here as a courtesy .
i don &apos;t need your campaign anymore .
i &apos;m taking my business back to my old firm .
oh , that &apos;s too bad because i already cashed your check .
you did not .
i did .
you know us jews .
you &apos;d do anything to piss me off .
you &apos;re right .
but i have still got a great pro @-@ muslim campaign for you .
good doing business with you .
did you hear the one about the arab and the jew ?
no .
but i &apos;m sure it &apos;s very funny .
an arab and a jew walk into a bar .
and then they kill each other .
energy is radiated and absorbed in quanta , matched to ... ?
patterns of black body radiation .
you know that &apos;s bad for you ?
it &apos;s like the equivalent of three buckets of popcorn .
but i don &apos;t want three buckets of popcorn .
oh , my god .
what ?
okay , i need your help .
don &apos;t shake the camera .
just keep it steady .
what are you doing ?
look at the color .
it &apos;s bollywood .
you can &apos;t pass up bollywood .
do you know them ?
no . it &apos;s chance .
i do this all the time .
grace , camera up .
what are you doing ?
good to have you back , mr. sartori .
so tell me , what is a power @-@ up ?
sorry , this is the only place in the world
where i have to explain a power @-@ up .
um , in a video game ,
it &apos;s something that you collect to give you extra power .
like a gun , or , you know , ammunition .
so , would anyone ever pass up a power @-@ up ?
huh ? no .
not unless you &apos;re crazy .
you never know when you &apos;ll run out of ammunition .
so this suicide vest that jimal &apos;s avatar is wearing , what is that ?
it &apos;s a power @-@ up .
and everybody who plays your game grabs one ?
at one point or another .
in fact , according to your own logs ,
many asas in mr. agos &apos;s office ...
objection .
overruled .
... many asas in mr. agos &apos;s office
have collected such suicide packs ?
yeah , it &apos;s a part of the game .
it &apos;s not a thing .
but doesn &apos;t that mean these asas
are more likely to have murdered simon greenberg ?
your honor .
mrs. florrick ?
mrs. florrick , any further questions ?
yes , your honor .
mr. sartori ,
jimal &apos;s roommate , amir al @-@ fulan ,
he played your online game , too ?
i have no idea .
this is a record of your subpoenaed logs .
can you read that there ?
oh , yeah .
and you had to reduce his privileges
because he fought with another player , didn &apos;t he ?
yeah , he , uh , he got in a fight online . on the battle m.e. board .
and who did he fight with ? can you read that there ?
you had to reduced both their privileges .
simon greenberg .
thank you .
jimal &apos;s roommate , amir , is the most @-@ likely suspect .
but he has an alibi-- praying .
yes , but he was alone .
what about the other roommate-- tariq ?
we can &apos;t find any contact between tariq and the victim .
and he doesn &apos;t have the political motive .
amir is the palestinian hard @-@ liner .
tariq could care less .
okay . thank you , alicia .
keep us in touch .
what do you think ?
i think ...
you &apos;re holding something against her .
i &apos;m what ?
alicia .
maybe it &apos;s unconscious , maybe it &apos;s not ,
but you &apos;re being hard on her .
no .
she &apos;s a third @-@ year associate on a partner track
and she &apos;s treating us like peers .
that &apos;s all you &apos;re seeing .
my god , am i the only adult left here ?
could everybody just put their emotions away ?
i &apos;ve got to get to a meeting ,
unless you have some other stray observations for me .
are we overdoing it ?
diane thinks i &apos;m going too hard on you .
am i ?
going too hard ?
all those late nights ...
no time off .
buried ... in work .
up to my knees .
he &apos;s doing it again , mom !
he &apos;s doing it again !
it &apos;s just my neighbors .
come on , let &apos;s go to the bedroom .
no , no , no , no , no . don &apos;t move .
leg is done , the chops are ready to go .
i &apos;m just warming up the leg of lamb piece
after it &apos;s been reposing for ten or 15 minutes ...
we need to eat better .
i like what we eat .
no , i need to cook .
you &apos;re happier without dad .
no , i &apos;m happier with you .
okay , that was such a mom thing to say .
no , it &apos;s about dad .
does that upset you ?
no .
i don &apos;t know .
you know i love dad .
i know .
i &apos;m sorry .
i found you a new tutor . dana .
i think you &apos;ll like her , she &apos;s social .
actually , i think i like this one now .
you ... i thought you said she was too different .
she is .
but sometimes different isn &apos;t always bad .
she &apos;s coming over to help me set up my computer tomorrow .
what ?
mm , she &apos;s setting up your computer ?
i asked her to .
please tell me you &apos;re learning something ,
and that this isn &apos;t all pointless .
i &apos;m learning something .
so how do you explain that , amir ?
i don &apos;t explain it .
you said you didn &apos;t know the victim , simon greenberg ,
and here you are on a video game fighting with him .
i don &apos;t need to talk to you .
you got no authority here .
hey , you want to make yourself useful in here ?
i just got the authority .
he claims it wasn &apos;t him .
it wasn &apos;t him , what , fighting against greenberg ?
on the video game .
amir says it was tariq .
he let him use his screen name .
these roommates-- they share everything .
so i &apos;m checking tariq , but we &apos;re back to square one .
amir had a motive-- politics , fanaticism .
tariq isn &apos;t political or religious .
i wonder if we &apos;re making a mistake
thinking it &apos;s about middle eastern politics .
these kids-- they &apos;re just ... college kids .
all rise .
okay , i &apos;ll keep checking , but i &apos;ll need some time .
judge karpman presiding .
thank you .
please be seated .
so , this is where we stand .
there is sufficient evidence for a finding of probable cause .
further , we set this case on my trial ...
your honor , we ask that you recuse yourself .
excuse me ?
we believe you have shown bias against our client .
believe ? really ?
in what way ?
your religion .
this is ...
outrageous .
i &apos;m ...
my jewish background
is completely irrelevant in this case .
your honor , you have given money to the outlook for israel ,
an organization that supports the settlements in israel .
we believe you have shown bias against our client ,
and we ask that a new judge hear further proceedings .
i &apos;ll give you my answer in an hour .
he &apos;s not going to recuse himself .
he will .
karpman always backs down when he &apos;s pushed .
he &apos;s afraid he &apos;ll be overturned on appeal .
so we start over with a new judge .
no . i know what alicia &apos;s doing .
hi , michael . how are you ?
i was just sitting here going over this campaign .
arab spring .
sort of like irish spring ,
but with arabs .
do you want some coffee ?
how much ?
for the coffee ?
how much for six months
if i brought the jewish league fund here ?
how much are you paying tarkovsky &amp; associates ?
you know how much i &apos;m paying .
well , of course ,
we would have to tell mr. al @-@ said
that we can &apos;t handle his account anymore ,
so if you &apos;d help us defer those costs ...
you &apos;re really a son of a bitch .
i am .
but now i &apos;m your son of a bitch .
all rise .
judge karpman presiding .
please be seated .
i &apos;ve taken great deal of time with this motion because
i believe that part of being a tough judge
is also being a fair judge .
your honor , may i quickly interrupt ?
can &apos;t imagine why , counselor . i &apos;m ready to rule .
yes , but ... i believe
mrs. florrick is attempting to manipulate this court .
excuse me !
if you recuse yourself , your honor ,
the court will be forced to choose a new judge tomorrow ?
is that correct ?
yes , it is .
you were about to make your ruling , your honor ?
that &apos;s what she &apos;s counting on .
do you know what tomorrow is , your honor ?
what tomorrow is ?
the holiday .
that has nothing to do with my motion .
it &apos;s rosh hashanah .
there will be no jewish judges in court ,
the case will be assigned to a non @-@ jewish judge .
that is why she &apos;s asking you to recuse yourself .
your honor , this is offensive !
mrs. florrick ,
i am ...
disappointed in you .
the motion is denied .
case remains on my trial call !
hi , tariq . how are you ?
so , what , are you following me ?
no .
i &apos;m following her .
hey , tariq .
you know , if you &apos;re looking for a more discreet gay bar ,
i &apos;d try scarlet &apos;s on halsted .
no , no , no , no .
i &apos;d try sidetrack .
it &apos;s too leathery .
what do you need ?
you used amir &apos;s avatar on battle m.e. , the online video game .
so ?
so , that &apos;s where you met simon greenberg .
no .
yeah .
actually ... yeah .
checked your alibi .
didn &apos;t hold up , tariq .
you weren &apos;t at the interfaith rally .
why would i kill greenberg ?
it @-@ it makes no sense .
we spoke to the bartender .
he said you met greenberg here quite a few times .
my guess is , you two fell in love .
you argued . he met someone else .
you got jealous . you stabbed him .
made it look like a hate crime .
i didn &apos;t mean to hurt him . i didn &apos;t !
why the reversed swastika ?
what ?
when you set it up as a hate crime ,
why did you draw the swastika backward ?
what do you mean ? isn &apos;t that how you draw it ?
is it good for the jewish league fund ?
i don &apos;t know .
the muslim was the killer , but he was also gay ,
and sleeping with our guy , so , uh ,
i would call that a classic mixed message .
crisis management .
if it helps our cause , i could find out if he &apos;s a top .
that was a joke .
yeah . okay , i @-@ i @-@ i got to go .
important work ?
fate of the world .
what do you think ?
it &apos;s very flattering , eli .
but i can &apos;t be thinking about the governorship
when i &apos;m doing this job .
so do this job .
let me think about the governorship .
just an observation from work .
if you &apos;re worried about alicia and will gardner ...
i &apos;m not ... worried .
i know , i know , but , um ,
if you were ,
i think that whatever was there is no more .
they barely look at each other .
eli .
you don &apos;t want a divorced candidate , do you ?
no , i ...
forget it .
you need a friend , k.
why do i need a friend ?
or a dog .
maybe you need a dog .
kalinda and pooch .
out investigating .
i &apos;m fine , will . really .
what &apos;s wrong with me ?
we &apos;re not like normal people , are we ?
what are normal people like ?
emotional .
you &apos;re emotional .
no .
sometimes i &apos;m in the middle of an emotion ,
and i just look at myself and realize ...
i &apos;m not feeling anything .
i just like acting like someone who feels something .
you want to stop acting and actually feel ?
yeah .
yeah .
that &apos;s what it feels like .
thanks .
i got to go .
i got to be somewhere at 8 : 45 .
really ?
that &apos;s specific .
yup .
be good .
i &apos;ll get them to school on monday .
you sure ?
yeah .
do we take our homework ?
yes !
yes !
so , you &apos;ve hired a tutor for grace ?
yes , i did . she &apos;s good , i think ,
and grace likes her or ... she likes her now .
i &apos;ll keep an eye on that .
oh , um , also ,
zach &apos;s girlfriend , nisa--
her parents wanted us to come for dinner .
i &apos;ll tell her you &apos;re busy .
yeah , yeah , tell her i &apos;m ... i &apos;m busy .
love you .
love you .
i love you . you call if you need anything .
