&quot; lexi for prexi &quot; ? really ?
your senior projects , have you guys given any thought
to what you &apos;re gonna do ?
a rock opera .
well , shakespeare &apos;s pretty intense .
we have to break up .
i &apos;m so sorry , talya .
what is that kid doing here ?
i invited him .
i &apos;m so happy you &apos;re here .
my beautiful granddaughters are getting to know each other .
we don &apos;t know that she &apos;s having a mastectomy .
she has breast cancer .
she has a pre @-@ cancerous condition .
&quot; super callie &quot; ? you &apos;re such a dork .
i got into this accident .
those people you almost killed , it was the fosters .
what about a.j. ?
can we at least wait till after the funeral ?
where are they , mike ?
look at all the comments you &apos;ve already gotten .
these mushrooms are all rotten , will .
they &apos;re not all rotten .
you just have to cut around the bad part .
that &apos;s what i keep telling you .
why risk us all getting sick ?
just get rid of &apos; em .
nice , mom . and subtle for once .
well , i &apos;m just saying , you know , mold ...
grows and spreads .
it &apos;s kinda like cancer , but that &apos;s your decision .
yes , yes , it is .
they &apos;re gonna take the cancer out
with a lumpectomy , sharon .
okay , can we not ... just not ...
what if they miss some and it comes back ?
recurrence in the same breast is fairly low .
oh , fairly low .
well , what about the other breast ?
do you want your daughter to have a double mastectomy
when she really doesn &apos;t need one ?
okay ...
i can &apos;t really say that having my only child
have a double mastectomy is at the top of my wish list .
i &apos;m just saying it &apos;s better to be safe than sorry .
get rid of &apos; em .
stop . please .
i ...
we &apos;re not debating this anymore .
i ... i &apos;mma do some tai chi outside .
no , will . please stay . stay , stay , stay , okay ?

mom ... please , mom .
mom , please . mom , come on .

mom , really ?
your mushrooms are fine .
um , the real ones .
they &apos;re ... they &apos;re absolutely perfect to eat .
good to know .
so what &apos;s going on ?
nothing .
okay .
this a bad time ?
no , no , no . we gotta get this done .
so have you told the kids about ty ?
no , i just ...
i wanna wait till we find them ,
and the longer they &apos;re out there , the harder that &apos;s gonna be ,
so let &apos;s get this affidavit filed
and we can get this arrest warrant .
and what about callie ?
what if a.j. reaches out to her ?
she promised me that she would let me know if he does .
* this love could be great *
* but they say it would be wrong *
* i don &apos;t care *
* &apos; cause i &apos;d be lost without you *
* we live because we love *
* we love &apos; cause we belong *
* yes , i swear *
* oh , you heal the scars *
* i &apos;ve never felt a wound *
* and we &apos;ll never need their rules *
* to guide the way *
* love will light the day *
well , that just made our lives a whole lot easier .
we found our romeo .
whoa , whoa . i &apos;m not an actor .
no , come on . we &apos;re all acting all the time .
then you do it .
no , i &apos;m composing .
so am i.
well , i &apos;m also directing .
y ... you have to do it .
okay ? that was amazing .
really ?
trust me .
okay .
okay .
so , now all we need to do is find our juliet .
what about talya ?
talya ? uh , no . no , no , no , no , no .
yeah ! she &apos;s a good actress
and she &apos;s got the best voice in drama club .
yeah , she &apos;s my ex .
what &apos;s the big deal ?
it &apos;s not like you &apos;re hung up on her or anything .
l ... let &apos;s just say it didn &apos;t end ...
all that well , okay ?
okay , so what ?
we &apos;re seriously gonna hold auditions ?
you really want to suffer through every pitchy
american idol wanna be in school who thinks they can sing ?
okay , that &apos;s why we should ask talya .
mat , even if i didn &apos;t think that was a terrible idea ,
which i do , there &apos;s no way she &apos;d do it , okay ?
she hates my guts .
no , no , we &apos;re gonna have to find someone else .
i want it to say &quot; i &apos;m confident .
you can trust me with your vote . &quot;
so , what do you think ?
first one or second one ?
uh , second one .
you &apos;re not even looking .
sexy junior class president or confident junior ...
yeah , the ... the sporty ... whatever that one ...
but that wasn &apos;t even an option .
hey , what the ... excuse me !
whoa , nice rack .
get out !
both of you , get out !
and put the toys away !
ana &apos;s coming over with the baby !
can you believe them ?
why are you looking at me like that ?
can you track the location
of someone who &apos;s messaging me on fost and found ?
probably .
so who &apos;s &quot; ana with the baby , &quot; huh ?
some chick you knocked up ?
no , it &apos;s our birth mom .
so all of you are adopted ?
yeah , except brandon .
one of my moms had him .
and none of you have a dad ?
well , no , we all have dads somewhere ,
but me and mariana don &apos;t really know
anything about ours .
i mean , aren &apos;t you curious who he is ?
i mean , what if he &apos;s , like ,
i don &apos;t know , pitbull ?
i doubt my dad &apos;s pitbull .
or maybe he &apos;s mario lopez .
all right , but seriously ,
don &apos;t you wanna know who he is ?
案犯有 泰龙 · 克里斯多夫 · 汉斯代尔 安东尼 ...
hold ... hold on , why are you naming a.j. ?
the warrant &apos;s for ty .
i think we have to .
he &apos;s just a runaway , stef .
he &apos;s aiding and abetting a fugitive , mike , okay ?
and that &apos;s a crime .
we don &apos;t ... we don &apos;t know if a.j. even knows what ty did .
he could have just taken off with his brother .
do you honestly think that they would skip town
24 hours before their grandmother &apos;s funeral
if a.j. didn &apos;t know ?
he knew , mike ... and they took off
because they knew that we were getting close .
come on . he &apos;s 17 , stef ,
and with his prior , they could try him as an adult .
you want a.j. to go to prison ?
i feel badly , mike . i do .
okay ? but he is 17,
and he is old enough to know the consequences of his actions .
all i could track was that the ip address is local .
what do you mean ?
somewhere in san diego ,
but i can &apos;t pinpoint exactly where .
wait , a.j. &apos; s here ?
looks like it .
are you gonna tell moms ?
i think ... i think i &apos;m gonna try and get him to come home .
you know lexi , my former best friend ?
she &apos;s running against me for class president .
well , i thought you guys made up after that debacle ...
i mean , debate .
do you even know what &quot; debacle &quot; means ?
uh , yeah .
okay , maybe that was nick &apos;s joke .
well , if you &apos;re gonna steal jokes ,
you should probably steal them
from someone who isn &apos;t a total ass .
just saying .
i thought that lexi and her family had to move back to honduras .
they did , but they got their visas , so they &apos;re back .
that &apos;s nice .
wait , wasn &apos;t lexi also your ex @-@ girlfriend ?
oh , uh yeah .
are you guys gonna get back together ?
probably not .
probably not ?
okay , not .
good answer .
i have to get this away from me .
is everyone else done ?
yeah .
uh , so , i was , um ...
i was telling my buddy , nick , about you ,
and he asked me if i knew anything
about my birth father .
uh , which i don &apos;t really ...
and i was wondering
if there was anything you could tell me .
um , like what ?
uh , like ...
what &apos;s his name ?
what was he like ?
uh , his name was gabriel .
i don &apos;t really know much about him .
we met at a party .
it ... it was a one @-@ time thing .
i don &apos;t even know where he is
or whatever happened to him .
sorry .
it &apos;s okay .
you don &apos;t have to be sorry .
it &apos;s not a big deal .
grandma &apos;s leaving !
i just want to ...
thank most of you for being so gracious
and welcoming .
my family .
my treasures .
my treasures .
my only living relatives .
the only people in the world who actually matter to me .
well , you matter to me , will .
stefanie ?
yeah ?
i don &apos;t know when we &apos;ll see each other again .
do you have to be so melodramatic , mother ?
just stating facts .
safe trip !
see you later .
oh , my ...
he ran away ? why ?
i guess to be with his brother .
i know you really cared about him . i &apos;m sorry .
well , at least now i can go back
to creating my online dating profile .
why don &apos;t you date ana ?
you guys would be so cute together .
yeah , we &apos;re just ...
we &apos;re just friends .
i think someone needs changing .
i &apos;ll change her .
so you two &quot; friends &quot; can talk .
so ...
listen , there &apos;s a little more to this a.j. story .
stef and i think that his brother , ty ,
was the driver who hit you and the twins .
sorry , i was just gonna go say bye to grandma .
hey , mom , what &apos;d you do to the rv ?
as difficult as it is to believe , stefanie ,
i didn &apos;t do anything .
do you think i would really do something
and keep myself someplace where i &apos;m so unwelcome ?
you &apos;re always welcome here , mom ,
but your opinions , however ...
i &apos;ll just keep my opinions to myself and we &apos;ll ...
push the old rv out of your driveway
and into the streets someplace .
actually , we &apos;re gonna have to borrow their electricity ,
if you ladies don &apos;t mind .
of course we don &apos;t mind .
i &apos;ll pay for the utility bill this month .
not necessary , mother .
oh , i insist .
of course you do .
by the way , um ...
a.j. agreed to meet me tomorrow after school .
fingers crossed .
who else knows ?
about ty ? nobody .
let &apos;s keep it that way .
your mom doesn &apos;t want the other kids to know until we find them .
i &apos;m sorry , dad .
maybe you were right about a.j.
i guess i should &apos;ve never trusted him .
i mean , i ... i don &apos;t know , dad .
he was ...
in a tough position . ty is his family .
he made a mistake .
committed a crime , brandon .
well , yeah , but i committed a crime .
when i made those fake ids . remember ?
and the only reason why i didn &apos;t get arrested
is because my parents are cops .
look ...
i have made some bad choices .
you never gave up on me , dad .
you don &apos;t give up on family .
i don &apos;t know .
all i &apos;m saying is maybe cut him some slack .
hey , i &apos;m heading out .
okay . see ya .
what &apos;s up ?
well , i &apos;m not sure if i should even be saying anything ...
about what ?
about your dad .
your birth dad .
what about him ?
well you know how my dad &apos;s a contractor , right ?
right .
anyway , i heard him talking to my mom the other day ,
and he was saying how he just hired gabriel on one of his jobs .
does ana know ?
i don &apos;t think so ,
but from what i heard , it doesn &apos;t sound like
your dad was just some random guy .
i think he was her boyfriend .
i can find out where he &apos;s working
if you wanna know .
vote mariana for junior class president
you want a button ?
talya .
so , mat told me what you &apos;re doing
for your senior project , and i &apos;d love to be your juliet .
i mean , not your juliet ,
but i mean ...
right . yeah , no , that ... that &apos;d be ... that &apos;d be great .
here &apos;s the thing , we &apos;re actually having ,
open auditions .
my mom &apos;s vice principal , as you know ,
so , she &apos;s kinda making us , so ...
but you should totally come to audition ,
you know , if you want to .
no problem .
prepare to be blown away .
hey , callie .
how have you been ?
good . yeah .
good .
yeah .
you know , a bunch of the kids
at the center are talking about &quot; fost and found . &quot;
such a great idea .
hey , congratulations ! you got adopted !
i &apos;m so glad things are going so well , callie .
yeah , yeah . thanks .
you know i was actually gonna reach out to you ,
see about doing an event , a fost and found event
at the drop @-@ in center , if you &apos;re interested .
you know that sounds great , but i actually have to go
because i have to meet someone , but ...
let &apos;s talk soon , yeah ? for sure .
okay .
yeah cool , we &apos;ll talk later .
bye .
open auditions ?
we said we weren &apos;t gonna do that .
yeah , yeah , i know , i know , i know . okay .
i may have panicked a little bit
when talya said she wanted to be my juliet .
but that &apos;s good , right ?
that means she doesn &apos;t hate you after all .
oh , no , no , i &apos;m pretty sure she still hates me .
but you know talya .
she &apos;s ambitious and she loves drama .
okay , okay , i get it . it &apos;s awkward .
but do you wanna do all this work
and then cast a juliet who can &apos;t sing ?
we have to be professional here .
well , now we have to have the auditions
or else she &apos;s gonna know i lied to her .
fine .
but when talya auditions and she is the best juliet ,
you &apos;re just gonna have to suck it up , deal ?
okay , deal .
now look me in the eyes when you say that .
deal .
thank you .
my eyes hurt .
do you wanna maybe do something else ?
no , it &apos;s okay . i wanna keep playing .
you can do whatever you want .
do you want a snack ?
i &apos;m gonna go in the kitchen .
where &apos;s jude ?
don &apos;t know .
so is jack , like , your new best friend now ?
he &apos;s friends with our xbox ,
but that &apos;s about it .
how &apos;s connor ?
who knows ?
are you guys still ...
yeah , we &apos;re ... still .
when &apos;s he gonna come see you then ?
i don &apos;t know .
he &apos;s all into his new school and now he &apos;s doing football ,
so he &apos;s practically got games every weekend .
yeah , but la &apos;s only a few hours away .
might as well be another planet .
so what else did she say ?
nothing .
just that his name &apos;s gabriel and he was some random dude .
that &apos;s it ?
yeah , and then my cousin said that
he was more like her boyfriend or something .
dude ...
one of those guys could be him .
you ever see his picture ?
no .
i told you , i have no idea what he looks like .
hey , what about him ?
which one ?
that guy with the nail gun . right there .
he looks just like you .
that &apos;s gotta be your dad .
dude , go talk to him .
i can &apos;t just go up to him
and be like , &quot; hey , i &apos;m your son . &quot;
why not ?
because !
what if i yell out his name ?
see if he even turns around ...
no , don &apos;t !
then what are we even doing here ?
look , i don &apos;t know , man , okay ?
all right , let &apos;s just ... let &apos;s just go .
come on ! drive ! i mean it ! let &apos;s go !
jesus !
hey , toss me that socket wrench , would ya ?
uh ... which one ?
the long one .
that &apos;s it .
muchas gracias .
that &apos;s cool you know how to fix cars .
well , my dad was a mechanic , so ...
my dad works in construction ...
i think .
you think ?
he &apos;s my birth dad . i don &apos;t actually know .
well , do you want to ?
i don &apos;t know .
i happen to believe
that man &apos;s connection to his father shapes his life ,
and he has to choose how that relationship or ...
you know , lack of one is gonna define him .
so ...
do you think i should get to know him ?
doesn &apos;t matter what i think .
matters if you think you have to know who your dad is ...
to know who you are .
where &apos;s your friend ?
i guess he went home .
he didn &apos;t say goodbye .
oh , that &apos;s odd .
he &apos;s odd .
i think i found him .
hey , what the hell are you doing in my moms &apos; bed ?
jude !
what is going on ?
i ... i just came up to use the bathroom .
but so you decided to climb in their bed ?
who does that ?
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m just ... i was ...
i was tired and it looked really comfortable .
what are you ? goldilocks ?
jude , stop it !
i &apos;m ... i &apos;m gonna go .
wha ... good . and don &apos;t come back .
can i give you a ride home ?
no , thanks .
look , i know you &apos;re upset about connor ,
but don &apos;t take it out on him .
he &apos;s just so weird .
a lot of people used to think that we were weird too .
remember that ?
so ?
he didn &apos;t show .
rafael came in ...
you know , the guy from the drop @-@ in center ...
and ...
i &apos;m thinking maybe a.j. saw me with him
and then ran or maybe he just blew me off .
i don &apos;t know .
answer it .
hi , callie .
a.j. ?
are ... are you okay ?
i &apos;m all right .
i ... i just wanted to call and tell you i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m sorry i left without saying goodbye .
you doing okay ?
yeah , i &apos;m just worried about you .
is ... is mike really pissed at me ?
no , he &apos;s just sad , i think .
he misses you . we all do .
where are you staying ?
you &apos;re not on the streets , are you ?
no , no .
we &apos;re crashing with some dudes that ty knew , but ...
it &apos;s kinda sketchy .
please come home , a.j.
i can &apos;t .
i can &apos;t do that to ty .
look , i gotta go .
they don &apos;t know that i &apos;m using their phone
for a long @-@ distance call .
wait , long distance ?
aren &apos;t you in san diego ?
no .
no , but the email address you &apos;ve been using
on fost and found is from here .
i haven &apos;t been on fost and found .
but we &apos;ve been iming .
no , i don &apos;t know
who you &apos;ve been talking to , but it &apos;s not me .
look , callie , i gotta go . take care .
what did he say ?
that wasn &apos;t a.j. on fost and found .
you got catfished ?
i guess .
where is he ? did he say ?
no .
what are you gonna do ?
it &apos;s an arizona area code
and i think it &apos;s a landline .
he sounds like he really wants to come home .
i &apos;m just afraid that if he stays with his brother ,
he &apos;s gonna get in some real trouble .
well , you did the right thing , callie . you really did .
okay ?
so what next ?
well , hopefully we &apos;ll trace this back to an address
and , um ... and then we go get him .
i &apos;m leaving tonight
to assist the phoenix pd with the arrest .
stef , please . let me go in first ,
talk to a.j. into coming back on his own ,
before the arrest .
he doesn &apos;t deserve to go to prison
for just standing by his brother .
i &apos;m not risking ty running again .
i made that mistake last time .
come on ! what about brandon ?
how many times has he messed up and we let him off the hook ?
do not equate brandon &apos;s mistakes
with a.j. protecting the driver that almost killed my children !
honey , maybe mike has a point .
think about what this could do to a.j. &apos; s future .
lena , you know that
i always take your opinion seriously .
i do , especially lately ,
but this is not open for a discussion .
mike , you don &apos;t have to be a part of this .
it won &apos;t fall on you .
i can take care of this .
mariana , jude , get down here . you &apos;ll be late .
so you &apos;re having auditions for r &amp; j ?
yeah , but mat &apos;s playing romeo ,
so don &apos;t even think about it .
don &apos;t worry , i don &apos;t want to be in your stupid musical .
i &apos;m not gonna have time when i &apos;m class president .
cocky .
not cocky , confident .
and why shouldn &apos;t she be ?
thank you , mama .
do you know what time you &apos;ll have the results ?
well , everyone votes at lunch , and we should have
the results tallied by the end of today .
hey , where &apos;s mom ?
she went to go get a.j.
he called me . he &apos;s in arizona .
with his brother ?
yeah , i think so .
♪ just one more step ♪
♪ just one more breath ♪

that was awesome , talya .
thank you .
yeah , it was ... it was ... it was great .
we &apos;ll let you know really soon .
okay .
well , it looks like we found our juliet .
come on , dude .
sometimes you just gotta suck it up
and do the right thing .
uh , what ... what are you doing here ?
i &apos;m auditioning .
it &apos;s open auditions , right ?
right ,
but aren &apos;t you gonna be , like , too busy
with junior class president and all that ?
i lost .
the results haven &apos;t been announced yet , but ...
mama gave me a heads @-@ up .
lexi won .
so , now that i have plenty of time ,
i &apos;d really like a chance ...
just a shot at being in your show .
okay .
yeah . let &apos;s ... let &apos;s start with the chorus .
okay .
♪ i will be brave ♪
♪ i will be strong ♪
♪ nothing can tear us apart ♪
♪ just one more step ♪
♪ just one more breath ♪
♪ for you , i will ♪
♪ i will be brave ♪
uh , that ... that was really good .
so we will , uh ...
we will ...
we &apos;ll get back to you .
no .
no way .
come on , dude .
sometimes you just gotta suck it up
and do the right thing .
hey , mariana , wait !
look ...
if you don &apos;t want me to be in your musical ...
that &apos;s okay .
you can say it .
i don &apos;t want you in my musical .
okay .
i don &apos;t want you in my musical , but ...
you were hands down the best juliet .
so ... would you ...
... be in my musical ?
look , i ...
i wanted to apologize for what i said .
it &apos;s okay if you don &apos;t want to hang out with me anymore .
that &apos;s not it .
it feels like you don &apos;t want to hang out with me .
i mean , whenever you come over ,
all you want to do is play video games .
that &apos;s not true .
i really like you .
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;ve ...
never really had friends before .
and i like being here .
you &apos;re so lucky . i wish ...
i wish i could have a family like this .
it &apos;ll happen .
no , it won &apos;t .
not for me .
i know i &apos;m weird .
that &apos;s why no one &apos;s ever adopted me
and why they never will .
look , i used to think the same thing ,
but look at me now .
just don &apos;t give up .
come on . let &apos;s go play clash of clans .
can we play the racing game ?
ready ?
yeah .
listen , um ...
does a.j. know that mom &apos;s coming to get him ?
no .
i can tell he wants to come home .
he just doesn &apos;t have the heart to leave his brother , you know ?
so you ... you made the decision for him .
um , except th @-@ there &apos;s something you don &apos;t know .
mom and my dad think that ty
was the one driving the car that hit ana and the twins ...
which means ...
a.j. is helping a criminal .
so , if they find him with ty ...
he could get in a lot more trouble
than for just running away .
um , i &apos;ll be right back .
yeah .
hello ?
a.j. ? it &apos;s callie .
ty , is that you ?
what &apos;d you tell callie ?
nothing , i swear .
get your stuff . we &apos;re leaving . now !
come on ! move !
i &apos;m not goin &apos; .
what ?
i can &apos;t . i can &apos;t run anymore .
i &apos;m sorry , ty .
you go .
it &apos;s okay .
police ! open up !
tyrone hensdale ?
that &apos;s me .
we have a warrant for your arrest .
both hands on your head , please , and turn around .
sir , hands behind your back .
a.j. , we &apos;re arresting your brother
because he was involved in the hit and run
that injured mariana and jesus .
now , i know you knew nothing about that ,
but we &apos;re gonna have to take you
in for running away , all right ?
let &apos;s go .
connect these nails here and here ...
when you get done with that nail , that sure will ...
thanks , man .
excuse me .
excuse me .
hey , are you gabriel ?
no . that &apos;s gabriel over there .
who wants to know ?
uh , somebody told me to
talk to him about getting a job here .
how old are you ?
18 .
okay .
we could use the help today .
it pays 10 bucks an hour in cash , under the table .
go help gabriel .
uh , that guy said i was supposed to help you .
all right . grab the other side .
why didn &apos;t you tell me
that ty was the driver from the accident ?
i couldn &apos;t , callie .
so is a.j. gonna be charged with , like , a crime now ?
i don &apos;t think so . no .
so what &apos;s gonna happen ?
they &apos;re gonna bring him back to san diego and he &apos;s ...
and he &apos;ll go to juvie .
i should have never said anything .
i think that he &apos;ll see
you &apos;re just trying to be a good friend , cal .
i warned a.j. to , uh , to play dumb about ty ,
so i think that if he keeps quiet ,
he &apos;ll be fine .
i &apos;m , uh , sorry for snapping before i left .
what did you mean when you said you &apos;d been taking my ,
my opinions to heart lately ?
does this have to do with the mastectomy ?
because i thought you agreed
you weren &apos;t going to do something so radical
if you didn &apos;t have to .
look .
does this mean ...
it probably means ...
it &apos;s not a question of if i get cancer ...
it &apos;s a question of when .
having the brca 1 gene increases my chances
of getting breast cancer , invasive breast cancer ,
at some point .
so , since i have dcis ,
i think
i don &apos;t want to take any chances .
i think i do want to get a double mastectomy .
my baby ...
what can i do ?
stay .
i think i &apos;m gonna need you .
i &apos;ll be right here .
i &apos;m not going anywhere .
thanks , mom .
uh , listen , i ...
i think as soon as the rv is fixed ...
i think you should go on the trip .
i &apos;ll stay here .
stef needs me .
yeah . okay .
i &apos;ll head out first thing in the morning .
it &apos;s fixed ?
it was never broken .
listen , i didn &apos;t want you to leave your daughter
in the middle of a fight , you know ?
oh , you !
what do you see in me ?
a woman 10 years older than you ...
i see a beautiful woman
with a spirit 10 years younger than me .
are you saying i &apos;m immature ?
i &apos;m saying this isn &apos;t a fling .
at least not for me .
and i &apos;ll go on my trip ...
but i &apos;ll be back to get you .
whenever you &apos;re ready .
done ?
uh , yeah . thanks .
you wanna play another game ?
