every surgeon is trained to look for problems .
to look at a person and say , &quot; what &apos;s wrong with you ? &quot;
where am i supposed to be now ?
you can come with me .
cross .
drunk or deranged .
find out which .
sir . hi .
can i help you ?
i @-@ i @-@ i don &apos;t know .
you guys called me .
we &apos;re trained to foresee
the ugliest possible outcome .
she actually said --
steph said i &apos;m not as good a surgeon as she is .
is that true ?
of course not .
yeah , but is that the perception ?
do attendings just automatically go to anyone but me ?
i think you &apos;re amazing .
oh , my god .
oh , my god ! mr. jaffee !
when your job is to make people better ,
you &apos;re automatically inclined to look for the worst in them .
wilson , i have three kids .
three .
do you have any idea how little sleep i get ?
mr. jaffee ?
are you sure - you don &apos;t want to just sleep ?
you cannot keep this up .
grey is killing you .
i know , but i can &apos;t think of that right now .
&apos;cause right now , i &apos;m in a bed .
a comfy , comfy bed ...
with you .
did you just fall asleep ?
来电
got it !
wha--
hello ?
of course it is .
yeah .
of course it is .
this is ridiculous .
no , absolutely . absolutely i can .
no , of course .
who &apos;s mr. jaffee ?
simon jaffee . end @-@ stage renal disease .
he &apos;s been on dialysis for the last 18 months
waiting for a transplant donor .
why so long ?
antibodies .
he needs a six @-@ antigen match --
an impossible match until tonight .
it &apos;s -- we &apos;ve been looking forever .
it &apos;s like finding the holy grail .
blake , when was mr. jaffee &apos;s last round of dialysis ?
oh , looking ...
he was at the dialysis center two days ago .
electrolytes and renal labs were within expected limits , so ...
i &apos;ve been on his case since i was an intern .
i &apos;m so sorry , dr. grey . i will catch up .
it &apos;s okay , blake .
do the best you can ,
and ask wilson if you have any questions .
oh , there are my girls .
mr. jaffee , it &apos;s so good to see you .
where are the grandkids ?
i haven &apos;t even called them yet .
i @-@ i @-@ i wanted to wait until i knew it was a sure thing .
so ...
is it true ?
it &apos;s true .
we found you a kidney .
thanks again for breakfast .
my pleasure .
this was his last night in my house .
you just made the man pancakes .
because i am a benevolent leader and good host .
and i &apos;ve been waiting for this thing to resolve itself .
it has not .
this job is stressful .
i need to go home at night and be alone with my husband .
well , i @-@ i agree with that ,
but -- but --
miranda , he &apos; s my friend , all right ?
and he &apos;s my boss .
i &apos;m your boss , too . and his boss .
i &apos;m all your bosses .
if you want your wife back , take care of your business ...
today .
so , i &apos;m just wondering if maybe we should rethink
the resident @-@ rotation system .
i mean , - make sure that our residents
get an equal opportunity on every specialty .
isn &apos;t that happening ?
well , there &apos;s a danger that our residents
are being monopolized by a single attending .
she &apos;s talking about blake .
you know what ?
this is not your busi--
isn &apos;t blake with grey ?
yes , and she has been since she got here .
i worry she &apos;s not getting a full education .
and grey is --
she &apos;s -- she &apos;s running her ragged .
residency runs you ragged .
we &apos;ve all been there , torres .
you know this as well as anyone .
no , but this is different . this is different .
i think it &apos;s personal .
is it that you want to spend
more time with your girlfriend ?
amelia , could you please --
i mean , you are saying that it &apos;s personal .
hey , hey -- all right . all right .
has blake expressed this concern or just you ?
okay . - she &apos;s --
blake stays with grey .
we don &apos;t have a policy
to move around residents
to accommodate your personal lives .
no , that &apos;s not what i was saying .
if blake has a problem , she comes to me .
all right . he has already been seen .
i know the doctor is ...
hey , all .
i was just wondering
if someone could tell me where i can get some scrubs .
third floor by the dispensary .
cheers .
you &apos;re , dr. pierce , right ?
yeah , i @-@ i just wanted to say
i &apos;m super excited ,
and i can &apos;t wait to get started .
great .
go get &apos;em .
okeydokey .
yep .
who was that ?
i don &apos;t know .
i found you .
pulled a night shift .
this is a nice way to wake up .
i could get used to this .
how &apos;s your day ?
i had to listen to torres go on and on about her girlfriend ,
who meredith &apos;s got basically chained to her service .
i don &apos;t know how she even looks at her .
i &apos;m sorry . you were saying ?
was i ?
gary , this is dr. karev .
gary walton , 14 .
complaining of abdominal pain .
how &apos;s it going , gary ?
this ball looks like a cherry .
do you like cherries ?
gary was born with some intellectual disabilities .
well , i &apos;m more of an apple guy myself .
but , uh , do you like cherries ?
i love cherries .
loves these stupid things .
and that &apos;s probably why he ate one .
joel !
he did , actually . he swallowed the other one .
is he gonna be okay ?
here it is on the x @-@ ray .
i can show you where it is .
gary , you want to show dr. karev what you showed me ?
gary . what &apos;d you do that for ?
it looked like a cherry .
well , i bet it didn &apos;t taste like one .
it &apos;s in my tummy now .
this doctor says he needs surgery .
endoscopic surgery just to remove the ball , right ?
i think dr. spencer jumped the gun a little .
gary &apos;s body has its own exit strategy .
gary , you &apos;re gonna poop it .
oh , ho , ho , that is going to hurt .
joel !
well , maybe it &apos;ll keep him from doing crap like this .
well , so don &apos;t worry . no surgery .
oh , good . thank you .
we &apos;ll just keep him here overnight ,
and , we &apos;ll make sure everything comes out okay .
gary , want to sleep over ?
yeah !
okay .
can i stay with him ?
absolutely .
you &apos;re not gonna eat this , are you ?
no .
all right .
spencer , i need you to do hourly checks .
yes , sir .
oh , uh , just steer clear of the mom .
she &apos;s a doc knocker .
a what ?
a mom who &apos;s up for more than your bedside manner .
know what i mean ?
really ? she just seems like a concerned mom to me .
her kid &apos;s --
just trust me .
keep a buffer between you and her --
a stool , portable x @-@ ray -- anything .
i hate guys like that .
just &apos; cause he has a hot girlfriend ,
he thinks everyone wants to bone him .
mr. jaffee , we &apos;ve almost got the all @-@ clear .
we just need to take you upstairs
for a pre @-@ op chest x @-@ ray and an ekg ,
and then we &apos;re good to go .
so , you &apos;re gonna need to lose the hat .
he , uh , won &apos;t take it off . i tried .
look , my late wife gave me this hat .
you know , i caught 22 prize @-@ winning bluegills in it !
it goes everywhere i go . it &apos;s good luck .
and we found you a kidney , so the hat &apos;s done its job .
yeah .
well , can &apos;t i just keep it ?
hand it over .
okay . but ...
oh , my god .
yeah , that showed up a few months ago .
charge to 100 . press sync .
clear !
what do we have ?
here you go .
what are you doing ?
cardioverting . 150 . clear !
who are you ? get away from my patient !
found the scrubs , by the way . thanks for that .
your patient ?
charge to 200 .
i &apos;m in the middle of doing something here !
she &apos;s hypotensive !
i can see that ! clear !
riggs ?
hunt ! do you know this person ?
what the hell are you doing here ?
i &apos;m trying to do my job !
everyone stop !
who gave you privileges here ?
well , you did .
when you hired me , right ?
you hired someone for my department without telling me ?
shoot . riggs .
no , i was going to tell you .
you &apos;ll like him . i promise .
i &apos;d like to have decided that for myself .
oh , but he &apos;s great .
he was in line to be chief of cardio at duke .
he &apos;s done incredible amounts of relief work --
and you hired him here without any discussion ,
without asking a single --
hunt , it &apos;s not your department . what &apos;s your problem ?
look , pierce , i &apos;m sorry , but he was available ,
we had an opening , and i made a call .
and i &apos;m the chief .
now , kindly go away . i &apos;m operating .
thanks for having my back .
oh , right . no problem .
so , how long have you had this lump , sir ?
oh , not long .
seven , eight months now .
and you never had it treated ?
well , it was just a little bump at first , you know ?
i thought it was a bug bite .
and then i thought maybe it was a cyst .
and then i was afraid .
that they would kick you off the transplant list .
i already called the grandkids .
maybe i should &apos;ve waited ?
this is not a plastics case . i think it &apos;s a tumor .
that &apos;s what i was afraid of .
i mean , if this is cancer ,
there &apos;s no way he &apos;s getting that kidney .
yeah , it &apos;s likely - invaded locally , the tumor .
it &apos;s possibly metastasized .
sorry .
did we get the pet scans ?
i thought we were waiting on neuro and ortho consults .
okay , we need to run oncology staging
on this mass right now .
pet scans asap with renal precautions .
and why are these consults taking so long ?
i &apos;m sorry . i pushed .
they were busy .
that &apos;s fine .
just , let me know when we get them , okay ?
okay .
why is she going easy on you ?
what &apos;d you do ?
i have no idea .
okay .
any interest in trivia night at a lesbian bar ?
i &apos;m not sure i know that much about lesbians .
funny . you &apos;re -- you &apos;re funny .
listen , i &apos;m just trying to dip my toes in the pool .
you know , the dating pool .
it &apos;s been a while ,
and i need , like , a wingman . or wingwoman . whatever .
because women don &apos;t buy drinks for sad loners --
i have a date with jackson tonight .
oh , that &apos;s great !
i know !
he , asked me to dinner to talk ,
and i &apos;m trying really hard not to get too excited about it .
oh , but that &apos;s a start , so ...
yes , yes , it &apos;s a light
at the end of a long , dark tunnel .
i &apos;m so glad , april . i &apos;m so -- - sorry , i --
yeah . no .
got a sec ?
hey . what &apos;s up ?
listen .
you know , - miranda and i were talking ,
and she -- well , both of us ,
we were wondering - if tonight you might , uh --
ah , i can &apos;t do anything tonight .
i &apos;m going to dinner with april .
april ? really ?
yeah . i asked her .
you know , i figure we &apos;re in a pretty good place ,
and now we can actually talk ...
that &apos;s fantastic .
... about divorce .
so ...
well , that &apos;s--
damn .
i &apos;m sorry , man . i wish there was --
yeah , i do , too . thanks , man .
another night , though ?
another night .
all right . good luck .
yeah . see you at home , buddy .
yes , you will .
i finally pinned down dr. torres and dr. shepherd ,
and they &apos;re looking at mr. jaffee &apos;s scans .
okay , great . tell them i &apos;ll be right there .
how do you do that ?
how do i do what ?
work with blake after ...
i mean , how are you doing that ?
well , i thought
that i could treat her like any other resident .
but that was really hard ,
because i wanted to punch her in the face .
like , a lot .
so now i &apos;m trying something different .
i am keeping her - on a short leash at a distance
so at least she can &apos;t hurt anyone else .
i just don &apos;t think i could do that .
well , she &apos;s here . she &apos;s not going anywhere , so ...
mrs. brown ? i &apos;m dr. pierce .
i &apos;m the chief of cardiothoracic surgery .
and this is doctor -- - dr. riggs .
hi . well , i &apos;m glad to see you awake , loretta .
you gave us a bit of a scare , there .
when can i go home ?
uh , i &apos;d like to run some more tests
to determine whether you &apos;ll need surgery .
we &apos;ve called your family . they &apos;re on their way .
dr. riggs , do you think i need surgery ?
well , your echo shows a reduction in blood flow
through one of the valves in your heart ,
so we just want to make sure that --
i &apos;d like to keep you overnight to run some more tests .
and i &apos;ll take it from there , okay ?
dr. riggs ?
you &apos;re gonna be well taken care of .
it &apos;s your first day .
might want to get your feet wet before you dive in .
my feet were pretty wet when i got here .
then you can get me a cardiac @-@ gated ct
and do a risk stratification .
page me with the results .
yes , ma &apos;am .
thank you .
well ?
osteosarcoma .
it involves the frontal and the occipital bone .
it &apos;s locally very aggressive .
it &apos;s a lovely tumor .
it &apos;s almost cute . just plopped there . &quot; hello . &quot;
he &apos;s waited 18 months for this kidney .
we finally have one , and now he has cancer ?
what if he didn &apos;t ?
didn &apos;t what ?
have cancer .
his tumor has gorgeous margins .
it &apos;s like a ripe , juicy piece of fruit
that &apos;s hung low on the branch .
i could reach in and pluck it .
no cancer , no problem .
you can do that ?
no .
even if you can remove it --
oh , i can .
well , he &apos;s left with a gaping hole in his head .
no skull , no skin to cover it .
i fix brains .
i give you your soft , gooey center .
the hard candy shell is your department .
no , there &apos;s no way to close it .
not even a rotational flap .
there &apos;s nothing to work with here .
and a wound that size ,
when his immune system is already compromised ,
that could kick him off the transplant list .
we have less than 24 hours before we lose the kidney .
so , wilson and edwards , i need ideas .
crazy ideas , smart ideas .
give me anything that will close mr. jaffee &apos;s head
so he can survive this surgery .
go . hit the books . find me something .
on it .
absolutely .
dr. grey ?
should i look too , or ... ?
blake . no , you should , um ...
go monitor the donor . do that .
make sure the brain @-@ dead guy is still brain @-@ dead .
got it .
what are you doing ?
excuse me ?
&quot; monitor the donor &quot; ?
you &apos;ve got blake doing scut that an intern could do .
she is here to learn . and , well , i --
listen , callie .
when i teach her , you say i am beating her down .
when i &apos;m nice to her , you say i &apos;m neglecting her .
no , no , no .
you &apos;re neglecting your responsibility .
and if she were any other resident --
if she were any other resident ,
you wouldn &apos;t be talking to me right now , callie .
i &apos;m done talking about your girlfriend .
this is your problem .
it &apos;s not blake &apos;s , and it &apos;s not mine .
that &apos;s ...
oh , i didn &apos;t mean to startle you .
is he okay ?
ye-- listen , you have nothing to worry about .
gary &apos;s gonna be fine .
i imagine it &apos;s not the first time
he &apos;s done something like this .
you &apos;re right . you get it .
you know , it can just be so hard sometimes .
you know , he &apos;s a great kid ,
but he can be a lot .
well , you &apos;re doing a great job .
he &apos;s a great kid .
thank you .
thank you so much .
you know , you &apos;re -- - you &apos;re so nice , and so helpful .
thank you .
oh , uh , that &apos;s --
it &apos;s not a problem at all .
um , ma &apos;am ...
ma &apos;am !
it &apos;s elaine .
oh , uh , elaine , ma &apos;am , i ...
i @-@ i -- &apos; cause i have the other patients .
but i &apos;ll -- i &apos;ll -- uh , bye .
yeah , bye .
i &apos;ll see you in an hour ? !
finally . god , what took so long ?
whoa , relax . this was nice of me , remember ?
i didn &apos;t know you were gonna make the food .
she &apos;s cranky .
bailey hired a new cardio guy without telling her .
that &apos;s jacked . who is this guy ?
it just means i &apos;m gonna have to train another alpha male
not to pee all over the place .
i hate it when they pee .
derek peed a lot .
oh , come on . we &apos;re not like that .
when you got here , you peed everywhere .
it was disgusting .
you had to be trained .
nobody trained me .
we trained you . it was subtle . you didn &apos;t notice .
is that why you made me get the food ?
not even that .
it &apos;s the patients .
it &apos;s the way that they always look
to the man in the room first
no matter who is talking to them .
yes .
that &apos;s a thing ?
not for you .
and then there &apos;s the whole other thing .
you know , i just -- i thought i was done with that here .
this guy just comes in .
he &apos;s taking consults without even talking to me about it --
what whole other thing ?
that ?
come on , is that a thing ?
of course it is .
here ?
yeah , here . anywhere .
ask edwards . ask bailey .
i can &apos;t believe that .
that &apos;s &apos; cause it &apos;s not your thing .
okay , tell me what you said to him .
how did you fight for our love ?
well , um ...
what ?
i , uh ...
what did you say ?
well , i started to , and --
look , i would have , but he -- he -- he told me
he &apos;s talking to april about divorce ,
and so -- - he &apos;s coming back here ?
do you get how serious this is ?
oh , i am off my game .
i hired a new cardio surgeon and forgot to tell pierce .
that &apos;s all the more reason for us to use this time
right now while we have it .
when -- when he &apos;s out
at what is bound to be a very , very long dinner .
oh , no , no . he could come back here any minute
in the middle of stuff !
okay , this is our window , miranda .
he &apos;s asking for a divorce .
there &apos;s no telling when we &apos;re getting our sofa back !
oh , yes , there is .
it &apos;s when you tell him to get the hell out !
when you get him to say , uh , &quot; thank you for your hospitality .
it is time for me to leave your sofa . &quot;
miranda , come -- - no !
you don &apos;t get it until you get it .
oh , that was delicious .
yeah , their pumpkin ravioli never disappoints .
this has been really nice .
yeah .
we somehow managed to finish our meal
without actually ...
ralking . right .
... talking .
do we need to , though ?
i @-@ i want to .
if you do .
but it ...
it &apos;s been so nice just having a meal with you .
we really should , though .
we should talk .
yes . yes . we should .
damn it .
i &apos;m -- - it &apos;s all right .
duty calls . it &apos;s fine .
i want to keep talking , though .
i do .
tomorrow night ?
tomorrow night .
okay .
someone , please .
do something .
dr. hunt ?
i can &apos;t find her .
i @-@ i -- - find who ?
dr. hunt .
no , do something !
dr. hunt . dr. hunt , dr. hunt .
are you okay ?
i &apos;m sorry . sorry .
i was just sleeping . sorry . you can go .
are you sure that -- - get out .
here ?
dr. grey said monitor . i am monitoring .
any luck ?
with the hole in mr. jaffee &apos;s head ?
nope .
3 @-@ d printing will take too long .
a custom @-@ based cranioplasty won &apos;t work , so i &apos;m ...
how &apos;s the holy grail ?
can we not call him that ?
sorry . just ...
he was someone &apos;s family member , you know ?
someone &apos;s husband , someone &apos;s dad .
to someone , he was everything .
and now he &apos;s everything to mr. jaffee .
but after all this time and waiting ,
we probably won &apos;t even get to use him .
he &apos;s everything , and it doesn &apos;t even matter .
it means nothing .
i know .
it doesn &apos;t seem fair .
he &apos;s everything .
pardon ?
he &apos;s everything . oh , my god , he &apos;s everything !
a skull transplant ?
skull and scalp , actually .
our kidney donor is a perfect match for mr. jaffee ,
which means that he &apos;s also a match for the skull and scalp .
lower risk of rejection .
he &apos;s everything .
we &apos;ll have all the vascularized bone
and skin that we need from the donor .
have you done this before ?
i haven &apos;t .
it &apos;s been done once .
it &apos;s a complex surgery , but i think it &apos;ll work .
same donor , same surgery .
well , i &apos;ll start on the tumor
while you two start organ recovery .
let &apos;s go get our kidney .
hey . um , come out for a drink with me tonight ?
it &apos;ll be fun . it &apos;s trivia night .
it can either be fun or it can be trivia night .
come on . broaden your horizons .
plus , i don &apos;t really want to go alone ...
uh , robbins .
did you know that henri giffard
built the first powered airship in 1852 ?
uh , no .
i did .
and i &apos;m free tonight .
i &apos;m always free for trivia night .
riggs , what happened ?
her heart &apos;s failing .
i &apos;ve asked for a balloon pump to buy us some time .
what she needs is a valve replacement , stat .
even better .
call up for an o.r. let &apos;s prep her for a sternotomy .
not a sternotomy .
keep prepping for a cath procedure .
no .
no ?
no . i need to open her up .
she won &apos;t survive being open that long .
i &apos;ll never get a catheter all the way up into the heart .
riggs , i am doing this procedure .
and you will be doing the wrong procedure .
prep for a tavr .
right away , doctor .
my name is on her chart .
i want to be in that room so that if something goes wrong --
don &apos;t worry , riggs .
if she dies , it &apos;ll be my fault .
my wife &apos;s dying ?
uh , mr. brown .
hello .
we &apos;re taking loretta up to surgery right now .
okay .
we &apos;re going to do everything we can .
hang in there , gary .
how long ago did the light stop blinking ?
it stopped ? i @-@ i @-@ i &apos;m not sure .
i might &apos;ve missed the last couple checks .
tell me what &apos;s wrong here .
the ball came apart ?
the ball came apart .
and the ball had little blinking lights .
so what is missing ?
i @-@ i don &apos;t , uh ...
a battery .
right .
now the battery is all the way over here .
now , if the acid from the battery
eats through his intestine ...
it &apos;ll perf his bowel .
well , could we get it with an endoscope ?
well , we could have . but now ,
thanks to you , i have to open him up .
so notify karev that i &apos;m taking gary to surgery ,
then you get a front @-@ row seat to how bad you screwed this up .
all right . see you in there .
you won &apos;t , actually .
i &apos;ll be in the donor &apos;s o.r.
making sure that the kidney doesn &apos;t grow legs and walk away .
what ?
grey has me babysitting the kidney until she needs it .
oh , come on !
callie .
that is --
grey .
yeah ?
blake is a third @-@ year resident .
she should be in our surgery . the skull transplant .
that is the learning opportunity here .
she deserves a chance to see it .
callie ...
callie , we talked about this .
blake needs to be where i need her to be .
you don &apos;t need her with the donor .
you just want her there . what for ? why ?
why are you doing this ? what --
what , do you just want her to sit there
and think about what happened to derek ?
callie , stop .
no , i am sorry , but i can &apos;t just stand here and --
you &apos;re embarrassing me !
nobody asked you to say anything ,
so just shut up and stay out of it .
all right .
now , i need you to -- - hold on .
i don &apos;t need her to fight for me ,
but -- but callie is right .
i &apos;m here to learn .
i want to learn , but you have to teach me .
don &apos;t go easy on me . don &apos;t expect less .
treat me like any other resident .
treat me worse . i don &apos;t care .
hate me , yell at me , i can handle it .
i will handle it .
you told me not to quit , and i didn &apos;t .
but you are right now .
and if you can &apos;t do what you are here to do ,
then please let me go .
are you gonna do something ?
i &apos;m thinking .
let &apos;s prep for a sternotomy . let &apos;s open her up .
good choice .
i know .
oh , come on . you can say i was right .
you weren &apos;t . she won &apos;t survive a six @-@ hour procedure .
it &apos;s her best shot . listen , i get it , okay ?
i &apos;d hate me , too , the way i was hired .
bailey should &apos;ve told you .
10 blade .
bailey is the chief .
yeah , but it was pretty messed up .
i mean , you and i should &apos;ve had a proper sit @-@ down .
i agree . saw , please .
you &apos;d have seen me in my suit .
it &apos;s nice .
i mean , it &apos;s probably wrinkled , but it &apos;s clean .
no , it &apos;s definitely , definitely clean .
you would &apos;ve asked me where i &apos;m from .
australia . retract .
and you &apos;d guess wrong . new zealand .
a common mistake .
seattle when i was 7,
then med school , fellowship .
the middle east for a long time .
prepare to make a large aortic purse string .
why ?
just do it .
why the middle east ?
oh , relief work .
i like the pace ,
the people , improvisation .
i once re @-@ inflated a collapsed pulmonary artery
on a dirt road with a straw and a set of car keys .
oh , you &apos;d like that story .
ooh , yeah , you &apos;d be asking me all about it .
you &apos;d be so impressed .
you &apos;d be thinking , &quot; wow ! he &apos;s so innovative .
and he &apos;s quick . i should hire him . &quot;
would i ?
mm @-@ hmm .
oh , yes . at this point , the interview &apos;s going very well .
take this .
3 @-@ 0 prolene .
but the kicker is when i ask about you .
how you landed a fellowship at the age of 25 .
how you made chief of cardio at an age
when most of us are still starting out
in our specialities .
i &apos;d ask about some of your 20 @-@ odd published papers
that i &apos;ve read .
mostly , i &apos;d like to know what the hell you &apos;re doing right now .
trans @-@ aortic valve replacement .
by not putting her on bypass ,
i turn your six @-@ hour procedure into --
into a one @-@ hour procedure.- brilliant .
bloody brilliant .
look , it may seem like bailey hired me on a whim ,
but i don &apos;t do anything on a whim .
i like to choose the people that i work for .
when --
when wilson told me that you lied ...
about , uh , being sick ...
... i believed her .
you didn &apos;t think that that --
that that was what ?
that i ... sided with her because ...
no .
good . good .
i mean , it crossed my mind , but no .
it crossed your mind ?
yeah , of course it did .
i mean , it &apos;s always a possibility .
it &apos;s always there .
but it wasn &apos;t .
wha-- with me -- you have to know --
hey , dr. shepherd ...
we are good .
blake .
okay .
where are you going ?
you want to stand in the corner
while i attach the holy grail of kidneys , be my guest .
no , no .
okay .
so let &apos;s give wilson a break , and step on in here .
i &apos;ve prepared the vessels for anastomosis ,
and i like an end @-@ to @-@ end with the internal iliac .
give me some room here . get back .
so , want to tell me why you missed the checks ?
dr. karev warned me
to steer clear of the kid &apos;s mom , and i didn &apos;t ,
and she sort of jumped me .
she &apos;s a doc knocker .
that &apos;s a thing ?
it is very much a thing .
h @-@ how did he see that ?
i swear i just saw a nice , scared mom .
let me tell you what karev saw .
a concerned mom
with a kid who takes a lot of energy
and a husband who only looks up from his phone
to contradict everything that she says .
a mom who was presented with a doctor
who was only interested in her son &apos;s well @-@ being .
made her feel good , taken care of .
suction .
i didn &apos;t see that .
of course not .
you &apos;ve only been a doctor for five minutes .
but you &apos;ll learn .
people aren &apos;t always who you think they are .
you learn to see through it . you learn fast .
oh , there it is .
right there .
you want to get it ?
chief .
looks like both of mr. jaffee &apos;s transplants were successful .
oh , great news !
oh , dr. riggs . how you settling in ?
well , you &apos;d have to ask dr. pierce that , i think .
well , have you met everybody ?
um , dr. nathan riggs ,
this is grey , shepherd , this is hunt .
nice to meet you . riggs .
hunt !
yeah , we , um ...
dr. hunt and i go back a bit .
oh ! oh , i didn &apos;t realize .
no . no you didn &apos;t .
maybe you should &apos;ve asked around
before you decided to bring
a complete stranger into the hospital .
all right , owen , why don &apos;t you and i just --
did you think this was how it was done ?
didn &apos;t you think for one second
that , as chief of this hospital ,
it is your responsibility to vet your people ?
&apos;cause this -- - this is a bad call , bailey .
this is a really bad call .
and it was thoughtless , and it was reckless -- - hunt .
why don &apos;t we go to my office and talk about this ?
what &apos;s done is done , right ?
what did he say ?
nothing .
whatever this is ...
he &apos;s not talking .
meredith ...
i made a promise to cristina
that i wouldn &apos;t let you go dark and twisty ,
that i &apos;d be your person if you needed one .
i don &apos;t want to talk .
okay .
you don &apos;t have to .
but just tell me -- do we hate him ?
we hate him .
okay , then . we hate him .
so , um , how &apos;d it go last night ?
ugh . it didn &apos;t .
i mean , dinner was great . it was fun , actually .
but when it was finally time to have the real talk ,
april got paged .
honestly , i think we were both trying to avoid the subject ,
but ...
yeah , i need to have sex with my wife .
and that can &apos;t happen with you in my house .
now , you &apos;re in a bad place .
i get that .
and i will do anything i can to -- i @-@ i will .
but i need you off my sofa .
i mean , it &apos;s for the good of the hospital --
totally get it . okay ?
i &apos;ll see you .
all right .
i mean , how did he seem to you ?
riggs ?
yeah .
i don &apos;t know . smart , capable , charming .
i think bailey was right .
owen wouldn &apos;t tell you anything ?
he just shut me out . i don &apos;t know why .
and then ... i &apos;m afraid i might &apos;ve been racist .
god , i hate this day .
okay . okay , back it up .
oh , good ! - i can talk to you about this .
i am worried i offended edwards .
i need you to tell me .
why me ? &apos; cause i &apos;m your sister ?
yes .
or because i &apos;m your &quot; sistah &quot; ?
no .
this is exactly what i was worried about .
okay .
what do you think you did ?
i don &apos;t think i did anything , but i think she thinks i did .
amelia , use your words .
did what ?
sided with wilson over her because she &apos;s black .
which i didn &apos;t do . i think .
i -- god , i @-@ i hate that this is even an issue all of a sudden .
well , it &apos;s not an issue for you .
and it &apos;s not all of a sudden .
i mean , okay ,
it &apos;s not &quot; mississippi burning &quot; or anything ,
but it is all over .
it &apos;s when people assume i &apos;m a nurse .
or when i go to get on an airplane
with my first @-@ class ticket ,
and they tell me that they &apos;re not boarding coach yet .
it &apos;s like a low buzz in the background .
and sometimes you don &apos;t even notice it ,
and sometimes it &apos;s loud and annoying .
and sometimes it can get dangerous .
and sometimes it is ridiculous , like right now .
but it &apos;s not funny .
i mean , if i &apos;m doing it and i don &apos;t even notice it --
then notice it .
look , did edwards tell you that she &apos;s okay ?
yes .
okay .
then don &apos;t give her the extra work
of having to make you feel good about it .
right .
okay , but how do i know that she &apos;s really --
because she knows you , okay ?
so listen to the words that are coming out of her mouth
and believe them .
this is not a small thing .
and i &apos;m glad that you feel like you can talk to me about it ,
but ...
i @-@ i don &apos;t speak for all black people .
i am not the spokeswoman . no one is .
and it is kind of annoying to be
asked questions like i am .
but , um , one piece of advice that i can give you
that i think we would all agree with
is that if you feel - uncomfortable having done it ,
check your white privilege , and don &apos;t do it again .
but i don &apos;t think you &apos;re racist .
you don &apos;t think ?
girl , get in the car .
okay .
he had so many grandkids i lost count .
i &apos;m not exaggerating .
seven .
he had seven grandchildren from six kids ,
who he raised on his own after his wife died .
are you okay ?
i treated mr . jaffee for years ,
and i finally get him what he needs ,
and you just come and take it and run with it .
and i helped you all day .
he was my patient .
that &apos;s all .
jo .
so , you want to grab a drink ?
yeah .
i would love that , actually .
okay .
so , um , we &apos;ve got science covered .
i &apos;m strong on history and geography .
uh , how &apos;s your popular culture ?
i just want to get a sense of our strengths here --
richard , i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m here to --
i wanted to have -- i &apos;m trying to ...
i &apos;m here to meet girls .
i don &apos;t care about trivia .
i don &apos;t even like trivia .
i see .
that &apos;s ...
and then you offered to come , and i didn &apos;t know how to say no .
and i just -- i didn &apos;t want to go it alone , honestly .
it &apos;s just it &apos;s been a long time , and i &apos;m rusty and nervous .
and i feel like i lived an entire lifetime
since the last time i dated ,
and i don &apos;t even know where to start .
you need a wingman .
what do you like ?
glasses ?
cardigan . she has a nice laugh .
you into tattoos ?
not that many tattoos .
well , you know , i @-@ i &apos;m just trying
to get a sense of what we &apos;re after here .
glasses is cute .
i &apos;ll be right back .
uh , sit up straight .
hello , ladies .
it &apos;s hard to fight against certain biases .
it &apos;s important to keep an open mind .
it &apos;s how we learn .
it &apos;s how we grow .
it &apos;s how we move forward .
dr. grey , right ?
yep .
yours is easy to remember .
it &apos;s on all the hospital stationery .
what &apos;s the story there ?
that &apos;s too long a story to tell .
i was actually headed across the street .
i was gonna grab a drink or something .
are you headed that way , or ... ?
i &apos;m a friend of owen hunt &apos;s .
until we don &apos;t .
i see .
so , no .
until we let our bias take over .
until we succumb
to what feels right or good
or satisfying in that moment .
because even then , deep down inside ,
we usually know we &apos;re going to regret it .
