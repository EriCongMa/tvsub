what was the deal with you and stefan ?
i was the first love of stefan &apos;s life .
stefan , meet julian .
julian was the man you were not supposed to fall for .
does stefan salvatore know that
you are pregnant with his child ?
what do you want , enzo ?
i want you to tell me how we &apos;re going
to prevent julian from walking back into lily &apos;s life .
so have you found julian yet ?
i found him months ago .
julian is the devil .
i can &apos;t let lily bring him back .
we got to bring this guy back to life now .
the phoenix stone brings people back from the dead .
you sure you want to do this to jo ?
if there &apos;s even a 1 % chance that this could work ,
i need to take it , no matter how dangerous or insane it may be .
bonnie ...
is there something you wanted to talk about ?
i guess , um ,
i &apos;ve been thinking a lot about ...
the past lately ,
how one stupid decision can--
can turn your life into something
that you don &apos;t recognize ,
like it belongs to someone else .
i made a mistake ...
and i lost someone i loved ...
and i &apos;d do anything to take it back ,
but i can &apos;t .
all i can do is ...
try and find a way to live with it .
thank you , bonnie .
alex , is there something
you &apos;d like to share with the group ?
what are you doing here ?
things are bad out there , luv .
you can &apos;t hide in here forever .
how &apos;s she doing ?
i don &apos;t know .
she &apos;s been sleeping for 12 hours .
that &apos;s normal , right ?
yesterday she was dead . today she &apos;s alive .
i &apos;m not sure normal applies .
please tell me that &apos;s food .
term papers . they were jamming up your in @-@ box .
you are still employed as a professor here .
hey , do you want a job as my new t.a. ?
all you have to do is write , &quot; interesting point , &quot;
in a few margins and then give everyone a b + .
tempting , but i need to figure out
exactly how i brought your wife
back to the land of the living .
look . she &apos;s here . she &apos;s ok .
what does it matter now ?
because in less than 24 hours ,
i raised two people from the dead
with a sketchy spell and something
called a phoenix stone--
no research , no rehearsal time ,
and no contingency plan--
and now that i have a little breathing room ,
i want to figure out what kind of magic i was dealing with
just in case i opened up pandora &apos;s rock ,
so can i have it back , please ?
hey , sweetheart , how you feeling ?
i &apos;m starving .
this is torture for you , isn &apos;t it ?
no .
no . i &apos;m so happy just lying here
and doing nothing ,
just listening to you breathe .
just making a mental checklist of all the things
you need to do today ,
debating whether you should accidentally
kick me awake ?
uh , did you say kick , or did you say kiss ?
good morning , lovebirds .
are you kidding me ?
i brought you some free @-@ range , overpriced coffee--
one cream , two sugars , just like you like it .
actually , i hate sugar in my coffee .
is there any particular reason as to why you are
barging into my girlfriend &apos;s dorm room
at the crack of mid morning ?
why such a grumpy gus ?
i thought you &apos;d want to celebrate today .
i finally got elena tucked away safely .
you &apos;re snuggled with caroline
in this tragically tiny bed , and ric--
ric saved his lady from the great beyond .
everything is coming up salvatore ,
so much so that i have decided
to turn over a new leaf .
oh , good .
yeah .
i am gonna be the man that does right by elena
all on my own by keeping her in my heart
instead of keeping her under foot .
that &apos;s interesting .
i &apos;m gonna need a little help with the dirty work ,
so rise and shine , brother .
we are going to interrogate a tall , beautiful heretic
with a terrible attitude .
valerie ?
rings a bell .
i am missing something here .
oh , stefan and valerie are old flames from way back ,
and they haven &apos;t had a face @-@ to @-@ face
since she came tumbling out of that prison world .
hang on .
valerie as in v @-@ card valerie ,
&quot; wham , bam , thank you , ma &apos;am , &quot;
broke your heart and , uh--
you know what ? i think this would be the perfect opportunity
for you two to catch up ,
unless there &apos;s a reason it would be uncomfortable for you .
no .
great .
have fun .
enjoy it , mate . it &apos;s the last of it .
good morning , oscar .
it was kind of you to sit with him all night .
oh , i &apos;ve had a few bad nights myself over the years .
right here , please , lucy .
thank you .
oh , what &apos;s the occasion ?
my mother always used to keep fresh flowers
when expecting guests .
i suppose i picked it up from her .
ah , julian , i presume .
yes . yes .
he &apos;ll arrive home today if all goes as planned .
this is a good thing , lorenzo .
i hope you can be happy for me .
there &apos;s no reason the two of you shouldn &apos;t get along .
yeah , thick as thieves , i reckon .
i want to drive , but beau won &apos;t give me the keys .
why , that &apos;s because you keep hitting cats
and utility poles .
he &apos;s still sitting there .
oscar , darling , it &apos;s nora .
do you-- do you remember me ?
i don &apos;t like this .
oscar &apos;s meant to be laughing and making jokes .
guess what , oscar . julian &apos;s coming back .
life &apos;s about to get fun again .
so fun . right .
well , he &apos;s clearly unwell .
we can &apos;t just leave him here .
lorenzo , you wouldn &apos;t mind
keeping an eye on him , would you ?
we won &apos;t be long .
happy to help .
thank you ,
and if you hear from valerie ,
please tell her to come home immediately .
i know i was stern yesterday , but that &apos;s no reason to sulk .
come on , girls .
where are you ?
headed out to find julian and trying to find
the directions on oscar &apos;s stupid phone .
why doesn &apos;t anyone use real maps anymore ?
what &apos;s wrong with paper ?
well , i suggest you get a move on
because lily and company are right behind you .
what ? that &apos;s impossible .
you promised to keep oscar quiet .
oh , oscar , he doesn &apos;t remember squat .
they must have tracked julian down
on their own with a locator spell
or some other heretic malarkey .
never underestimate lily &apos;s relentless
devotion to getting what she wants .
wait . what does it mean when the little
bar thing goes all red ?
i--
hello ?
no seat belt ?
that &apos;s a hefty fine , young lady .
how did you--
little bird brain said you stole his car
and sped out of mystic falls .
you did realize that by taking a deputy &apos;s suv
that every move you made would be tracked , right ?
would you kindly move your car ?
that car ?
you bet i &apos;ll move that car ,
but first , i need to ask you why you killed
your faux brother oscar and framed me for the murder .
i have no idea what you &apos;re talking about .
you &apos;re right .
i might not be 100 % on my detective work .
it &apos;s possible that another heretic
turned him into a desiccated corpse .
i &apos;m not sure .
i &apos;m gonna go to my car , get my phone .
i &apos;m gonna call lily , see if she knows .
fine . you &apos;re a genius .
what on earth made you think
i wouldn &apos;t do the same to you ?
hey , we &apos;re just talking here .
valerie .
stefan .
quit torturing my brother .
tell me exactly what &apos;s going on here .
is it safe to enter , or is your boyfriend
still half @-@ naked under the sheets ?
god , i &apos;m a roommate horror story .
please . at least your bed has seen
a half @-@ naked male all semester .
i think ms. cuddles is starting to feel sorry for me .
i mean , look at her .
do you see how she &apos;s judging me ?
i need man help .
well , don &apos;t look at me for advice .
i just sent my boyfriend to spend the day
with his first love .
valerie , the heretic who turned your skin
to vervain so you and stefan couldn &apos;t touch ?
yeah . that would be the one .
you &apos;re either completely insane
or the most secure woman in the world .
i want him to work things out with her .
he has this habit of bottling up all of his hurt feelings ,
and i think it would be really good for them
if they could just clear away all the 19th @-@ century drama
so they can get on with their lives ,
clean slate .
most secure woman it is . i &apos;m officially inspired .
so you going out to meet a guy ?
no . i &apos;m going to mystic falls to discuss
magic with a heretic i just brought back to life ,
and then maybe i &apos;ll go meet a guy .
ok . i think i got it .
you killed oscar because he knew how to get to julian ,
but you hate julian because he &apos;s a sadistic , depraved ,
no @-@ good monster that lily desperately wants to bring home .
did you ever hear of the black sea massacre of 1897 ?
julian annihilated an entire coastline on christmas day ,
and yet lily is still hopelessly in love with him .
so ? stefan took out an entire village in monterrey ,
and caroline still wants him .
to each , his own .
speaking of which , how did you two , um , meet ?
at the town fair .
oh , right . that &apos;s right , mm @-@ hmm .
and then you were supposed to meet after that , right ,
like , under a bridge or a tree
or romantic park bench .
will you please just shut up ?
you know , when you didn &apos;t show ,
this guy wrote 10 pages in his journal
about how the sun would never shine as bright
and the food would never taste as sweet .
yes . i read them .
your hiding places were always crap .
you really crushed the guy .
well , she was just spying for lily .
i mean , it was all just a game ,
wasn &apos;t it ?
but , yeah , no . hey , hey , keep going , man .
this bit is , uh , absolutely hilarious .
no . please stop .
the only thing that matters now
is that we find julian
and make sure he can &apos;t come home , so if you &apos;re not in ,
spare me the car ride and let me out .
no . stefan &apos;s in . he &apos;s in . i &apos;ll watch .
he &apos;s turning over a new leaf .
is that art or something ?
no . actually , that &apos;s a tv .
that &apos;s a tv . i &apos;m jo .
you &apos;re alaric , but you go by ric
because it &apos;s an odd name ,
and we &apos;re married .
let &apos;s not worry about the details right now .
it &apos;s gonna take a little time for your memories to come back .
this is amazing . did you make it ?
no . it &apos;s , uh-- it &apos;s delivery ,
made somewhere else
and then someone drives it over .
it &apos;s thai food , your favorite ,
well , except for that .
that &apos;s meat . you don &apos;t eat meat .
why would i not eat meat ?
i have no idea .
hey , look . let &apos;s open this bottle of wine , huh ?
it &apos;s got to be 5 : 00 in the afternoon somewhere , right ?
it &apos;s not serious . do you have bandages ?
i &apos;ll wrap it for you .
medicine cabinet above the sink .
be right back .
one makeup exam down , two more to go .
remind me never to be taken hostage
at the beginning of a semester ever again .
where are you ?
some gas station in the middle of nowhere .
don &apos;t worry care bear .
i have issued a no @-@ hanky @-@ panky zone .
no former flames will reignite on my watch .
nohow .
sorry about that .
the fumes are , uh , getting to his brain .
hey , listen .
uh , i want to take you to dinner tonight .
like a date ? wait .
is this because you &apos;re feeling guilty
for spending the day with your ex ?
no . it &apos;s because i realize
that i haven &apos;t actually taken you out yet .
well , i &apos;d love that .
to be honest , i &apos;m feeling a little bit guilty
for pushing you into a car with your brother and your ex
whom you clearly want nothing to do with .
ah , no . don &apos;t feel guilty .
i--i needed a push .
why ? what , did she make a move on you ?
nothing happened .
i just needed to hear that our time together was a lie .
she admitted that ?
she didn &apos;t deny it .
are you ok or whatever ?
i will be once you tell me
what time i &apos;m picking you up tonight .
8 : 00 , and i like daisies ,
by the way , just in case you wanted to give me flowers .
i &apos;ll see you tonight .
fill this up .
there &apos;s more gas in the tank , sassy pants .
i need an accelerant to burn julian &apos;s body .
don &apos;t want to take any chances .
aren &apos;t you getting a little ahead of yourself ?
we haven &apos;t even killed the guy yet .
are you really that daft ? we don &apos;t need to kill him .
what are you gonna do , charm him to death ?
julian &apos;s dead .
he &apos;s been dead since 1903 .
i &apos;m afraid this house no longer has an open @-@ door policy
to the local riffraff .
you &apos;re living here , aren &apos;t you ?
shall we spend a few moments catching up
before i throw you out ?
how was your summer holiday ?
meet any charming eurohunks ?
girl , please tell me you didn &apos;t just follow damon
around with spare bottles of bourbon .
i didn &apos;t , but it &apos;s sweet of you
to be concerned about my love life .
well , i do admire your nerve sticking around .
now , myself , i &apos;d be flat hunting
the other side of the planet if i were the only thing
standing between damon salvatore
and his everlasting happiness with elena .
maybe the danger gives you a thrill .
it could be a case of puppy love .
see , now i think you &apos;re projecting .
you &apos;re the one sleeping at lily salvatore &apos;s feet
hoping for some of her good table scraps .
good talk . nice of you to stop by .
um , i need to talk to oscar .
what about ?
witch business , super boring .
well , i &apos;m afraid oscar is not feeling
quite like himself today , so maybe another time .
bollocks .
not supposed to eat the help , mate .
a little blood , please ?
clean yourself up and take a spa day .
forget all about mr. chompers
and his very bad manners .
hello , oscar . hey , do you remember me ?
we met in myrtle beach .
i &apos;ve never been to myrtle beach ,
but i do remember you
from that dark room in the basement .
you the one that got me out ?
out of where ?
i think i &apos;m still hungry .
um , ok . just get a grip on yourself
for 5 minutes , and we &apos;ll get you more blood .
i came to ask you about the phoenix stone .
what stone ?
why do people keep asking me questions
i don &apos;t know the answers to ?
this stone . know it ?
there . you got me out of there .
why would oscar stash julian &apos;s body
out here in the middle of nowhere
when he could just hand it over to lily ?
because he knew the moment lily gets julian back ,
the fun &apos;s over .
everything changes .
hmm , so you killed him .
that makes a lot of sense .
i told you , i have my reasons .
you know , i was thinking , it &apos;s probably
a good thing that you and i cut things short .
i mean , what if i &apos;d accidentally insulted your driving
and you had no choice but to run a butcher knife through me ?
yeah . it &apos;s doesn &apos;t exactly sound like
you &apos;ve lived the life of a saint , either .
surprise . the world changes people .
you must have figured that out by now .
hey , lovebirds , quit your bickering .
let &apos;s get this campfire started .
casket emporium . clever .
oscar and his stupid pranks .
so lily &apos;s still carrying a torch for some moldy , old corpse , hmm ?
lily is determined to reunite julian &apos;s body
with his lost soul , but in order to do that ,
she needs the phoenix stone .
phoenix stone , huh ?
never heard of it .
really ? that &apos;s funny ,
since you clearly used it on oscar .
who said we used it on oscar ?
oscar was dead , and you needed something
to trade for your girlfriend in the box ,
so you tinkered around with it
and found a temporary solution ,
but , hey , good on you .
whoever you brought back
seemed to pull the wool over lily &apos;s eyes .
wait . what do you mean , whoever we brought back ?
the phoenix stone is stuffed full of very old vampire souls .
you didn &apos;t raise oscar from the dead , you clods .
you jammed one of those souls into his body .
how &apos;s everything with professor frankenstein
and his rebooted bride ?
good , i think .
she was still asleep when i left .
oh , good . glad to hear it .
so quick favor .
i &apos;m gonna need you to tell ric
that we made a tiny mistake
and that that &apos;s not his wife .
what ?
yeah .
it turns out that the stone doesn &apos;t actually
have any magic juice to bring back any old corpse .
it &apos;s more like a supernatural holding cell
for a bunch of lost vampire souls ,
one of which you accidentally shoved into jo &apos;s body .
oh , my god , that means oscar &apos;s--
oscar &apos;s just some random vampire in a
heretic candy shell .
damon , i came to your house to talk to him about the stone .
bad idea . cut the conversation short .
call ric from the car on the way home .
oh , no . don &apos;t put this on me .
well , i &apos;m sorry , and i &apos;m trying to do
this thing where i do right by elena ,
and i just--i--i just don &apos;t think
that she &apos;d want me to crush his spirit like that .
let him down gently .
is this you doing right by elena
or you not wanting to break your best friend &apos;s heart ?
fine , but you owe me .
thanks , bonbon .
found oscar a few blood bags stashed in the study .
probably expired , but he does not seem picky .
i have to head back to whitmore .
i meant to ask you about this pretty stone .
where &apos;d you find it ?
rocks r us . it was on sale .
that &apos;s funny .
lily &apos;s been looking for one just like it .
oh , bargain bin was full of them .
i &apos;m sure they have more .
or i could just take this one .
don &apos;t think so .
i &apos;m not going back in there .
i &apos;m not going back .
what the hell is he talking about ?
let &apos;s just say you were right .
oscar &apos;s not himself today .
why does everyone keep calling me oscar ?
my name &apos;s not oscar !
did i do that ?
run .
you want to get some fresh air ?
thought maybe a walk through campus will stir something .
what are you doing ?
what happened to me ?
this was mine , wasn &apos;t it ?
that &apos;s your wedding dress .
the hospital asked me if i wanted to save it .
what happened to me ?
your brother
had a lifelong vendetta against you .
he stabbed you .
i couldn &apos;t get you to the hospital in time .
so what happened ?
i &apos;m gonna explain everything when you &apos;re feeling better .
it &apos;s gonna make a lot more sense then .
why wouldn &apos;t it make sense now ?
because it is crazy , jo .
it is the craziest thing either of us have ever been through ,
and that is saying something .
i remember . i was stabbed .
i was stabbed in the heart .
no . no , not in the heart .
he came at you from behind , and i--
i didn &apos;t see him until it was too late .
no . i was stabbed in the heart .
jo , calm down .
i--
everything &apos;s gonna be--
no .
don &apos;t touch me . stay away from me .
you know , we got nora to siphon
that repulsion spell you put on caroline ,
just in case you were wondering .
forgotten all about that .
why &apos;d you do it ?
i mean , you couldn &apos;t have been worried about caroline &apos;s safety .
what do you want me to say ,
because i &apos;m pure evil ,
because i like seeing people suffer ?
well , if that &apos;s the truth , then yeah .
i &apos;m not a horrible person .
really ? well , then who are you ?
i mean , you turned my life upside down .
you leave , you show no remorse ,
and then you go after my girlfriend .
you know nothing about me .
this one won &apos;t open .
must be spelled shut .
doesn &apos;t look dead to me .
his body &apos;s been preserved with magic .
lot better @-@ looking than our old man .
i &apos;ll give mom that .
move ,
unless you want to burn to a crisp alongside of him .
incendia .
incendia .
shouldn &apos;t we , uh , get a match ?
i don &apos;t understand .
well , of course .
guess it ain &apos;t a party until the mean girls show up .
look who &apos;s in a heap of trouble .
what &apos;s lily going to say ?
let &apos;s ask her . lily , we found valerie .
she &apos;s over here trying to kill to love of your life .
girls , i &apos;ll meet you in the car .
i need a minute with valerie .
you may have stolen oscar &apos;s phone ,
but you left something behind in his pocket .
oscar always did covet julian &apos;s ring .
beau found him easily with a locator spell .
why would you do this ?
lily , he &apos;s a monster .
bringing him back will only make things worse .
so you go behind my back
with my own sons to destroy him .
it &apos;s not like you listen to me .
you were so blinded by your love for him ,
it &apos;s like no one else exists .
hey , we get it . you &apos;re angry .
whatever lies valerie &apos;s told you ,
that &apos;s all they are .
technically , she &apos;s been a bit vague on the details--
i mean , mass murderer , homicidal maniac ,
and typical , run @-@ of @-@ the @-@ mill bad guy stuff--
but before we just hand him over ,
you mind telling us what we &apos;re missing here ?
who is this really ?
this man is the love of my life ,
the man i didn &apos;t think i deserved ,
the one i fought for ,
waited for ,
the one i told myself i could change for .
he makes me better , damon .
you know anything about that ?
a thing or two .
then we are through here . beau .
no . please don &apos;t . he &apos;ll ruin us . he--
she &apos;s playing you . he didn &apos;t make her better .
if anything , he made her vindictive and cruel .
what &apos;s that supposed to mean ?
who do you think gave kai the idea
to put elena in that sleeping beauty coma ?
who ?
lily .
is that true ?
she wanted to make you pay for refusing
to help rescue us from the prison world .
screw julian . i &apos;ll kill you .
vis porta .
spelling the door ?
thought you were leading us to a secret passage .
you watch too much &quot; scooby @-@ doo . &quot;
maybe he &apos;ll tire himself out
and we just go out the front door .
or i could just jump out this window
while you fend for yourself .
first , give me that stone back .
first , tell me why it &apos;s so special .
it &apos;s some kind of trap for a bunch of souls .
if lily wants it , someone she cares about must be inside .
julian .
great , because we need another heretic
running loose around here .
he &apos;s not a heretic .
he &apos;s a long @-@ lost vampire boyfriend .
then you definitely don &apos;t need it .
do you really want to hand her the means
to bring the dead boyfriend back into the picture ?
have some dignity .
what makes you think i want romantic advice
from a lovelorn witch ?
i &apos;m just saying , maybe you deserve better .
bad news .
i think oscar just learned how to siphon .
where is it ?
where is the stone ?
he has it .
valerie .
valerie !
uh ... hey , you ok ?
i &apos;m fine .
whatever you &apos;re thinking , we &apos;re not gonna do that .
thinking i should rip out her heart
and bronze it like a trophy .
she &apos;s still our mother .
exactly .
our mother , stefan , is the reason elena &apos;s
in that box while the world passes her by .
i know . i get it .
just remember , you &apos;re turning a new leaf .
screw the new leaf .
she stole elena from me and every ounce
of happiness i &apos;ve ever known .
i &apos;m not gonna let her just walk away from that .
we &apos;re not gonna let her walk away from that ,
i promise , but right now , i need to find valerie ,
so just tell me that you &apos;re fine
and you &apos;re not gonna do anything stupid .
i &apos;m fine . i &apos;m ok .
good .
give me the stone !
here , boy .
fetch .
finders keepers .
valerie .
don &apos;t move . i &apos;m gonna get these out .
it &apos;s pointless .
if lily doesn &apos;t kill me , julian will .
well , maybe it &apos;s pointless ,
but i &apos;m not the type to leave someone hanging .
couldn &apos;t help yourself , could you ?
if i &apos;d have known how deeply you &apos;d hate me ,
i would have acted differently .
i don &apos;t hate you .
i just wanted to know the truth ,
and now i do .
it &apos;s not the truth , stefan .
the truth is ...
i was coming back for you .
what happened , miss your train ?
julian caught me trying to leave .
he was desperate to get lily to europe ,
and , well , he knew i &apos;d be a distraction .
why would you be a distraction ?
i was pregnant .
what ?
i wanted to tell you in person , though ,
and i felt ridiculous .
we--we spent so little time together
for me to end up pregnant , i just--
i wasn &apos;t sure if--
but julian had already found out .
he made sure there was nothing to tell .
what did he do to you ?
he , um ...
made sure it wasn &apos;t a problem anymore .
he knew i wouldn &apos;t be able to look you
in the eye and tell you , so i left with them .
i kept our secret all these years ,
and i &apos;m so sorry .
oscar died two nights ago when valerie killed him .
i &apos;m pretty sure that damon and bonnie
brought him back with this .
i suspect they didn &apos;t get it quite right , though .
he went mad and tried to kill me .
it wasn &apos;t him .
the soul in the stone has to be reunited with the proper body .
where did you get it ?
why would valerie throw away everything--
her family , your respect , her livelihood--
just to keep julian away from you ?
according to her , i &apos;m too blinded
by his charms to see his flaws .
give me the stone , please .
i won &apos;t stand idly by while you reawaken some bloke
who may or may not have complete control over you .
call it what you will-- devotion , control .
i call it love , so if you &apos;re asking me
to choose between you and julian--
that &apos;s exactly what i &apos;m asking .
please understand .
you with jo ?
no . she freaked out a little .
i , you know , i could really use your help looking for her , actually .
it &apos;s not her , ric . it &apos;s not jo .
what are you talking about ?
we made a mistake .
the stone doesn &apos;t bring people back from the dead .
it is just an old relic full of souls .
bonnie , that is my wife .
i know who i &apos;m looking at , ok ?
she just--she needs a little time to adjust .
no . it &apos;s not her .
jo was never in that stone , ric .
i put someone else in her body .
i &apos;m so sorry . where are you ?
i &apos;m meeting up with damon .
we can come by and figure this out together .
i got to go .
hey , i-- i just want to talk .
here .
i realized i have no idea how to use that thing .
nothing about this world is familiar to me--
not you , not any of this ...
not even my own reflection .
you &apos;re not my wife .
no .
i don &apos;t think i am .
if i &apos;m not jo , who am i ?
i don &apos;t know , but you &apos;re not alone .
i &apos;ll help you , and we &apos;ll figure this out together , ok ?
hey , uh , not to be a pessimist ,
but how late do you think you &apos;re actually gonna be ?
should i move the reservation to 9 : 00 or--
i &apos;m actually still in mystic falls .
or to tomorrow or next week ?
i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s ok .
things got complicated .
i know .
bonnie told me how the stone actually works .
alaric must be devastated .
i &apos;m sure he is .
hey , listen . i promise i &apos;ll-- i &apos;ll make tonight up to you , ok ?
is--is there anything else monumental
that i should know about ?
no . no , nothing . i &apos;ll see you tomorrow ?
ok . um , i &apos;ll see you tomorrow .
bye .
you didn &apos;t say a word the whole way back .
i didn &apos;t really know what to say .
uh , can you give me an overview of the options ?
i &apos;m angry that i didn &apos;t know .
i &apos;m sad that something i could have had was taken away from me .
i want to kill julian for what he did to you ,
and i &apos;m sorry that you had to go through this alone .
after it happened , i wanted to die .
i did die .
i took my own life .
i obviously didn &apos;t realize i had vampire blood in my system .
that &apos;s how you became a vampire ,
you killed yourself ?
far cry from that girl you met at the fair , isn &apos;t it ?
it &apos;s funny how one event can change the outcome of your entire life .
please don &apos;t tell anyone .
i couldn &apos;t bear for lily to know .
i won &apos;t , i promise .
ok . i don &apos;t presume to know you now
or even what you wanted back then ,
but--
yes .
would i have wanted a child ?
yes .
look . we have , um , 5 guest rooms .
you should probably stay the night .
no . i should run
as far and fast as i can .
damon won &apos;t let lily get her hands on that stone ,
and if she does , i will kill julian myself .

so lily is the reason i &apos;ll never see elena again .
apparently , she has a thing for emotional torture .
guess the apple doesn &apos;t fall far from the tree .
hey , i do not go behind people &apos;s back and torture them .
i like my enemies to look me in the eye
and see the depth of my rage .
sure you want to do this ?
burning that bastard &apos;s body
would &apos;ve been too good for lily .

i want to give her that man that she &apos;s cherished
and loved and missed for a hundred years .
julisan melunaweh washaset .
ababbas dagoineh mateesah elunatan .
i want her to run into julian &apos;s arms ,
and i want her to remember what
it feels like to have that love returned .
i want her to taste true happiness ...

julian , is it you ?
lily ? darling .
and then i want to rip his head off right in front of her .
i want to break her heart .
i want to break her spirit .
i want to destroy her .
so much for the new leaf , huh ?
tell me i &apos;m being stupid and reckless and cruel .
tell me i &apos;m not doing right by elena .
you &apos;re doing right by elena .
well , glad to see you boarding this train
to crazytown , bonnie bennett .
i was getting lonely all by myself .
