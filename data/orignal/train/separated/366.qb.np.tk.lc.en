restoration
yeah , sounds good , sounds good .
don &apos;t put too much cheese on it .
yeah , i &apos;ll be home in an hour .
oh . mr. rango . we got here as fast as we could .
sorry , kids , i &apos;m leaving .
oh , but billy &apos;s gonna die if we don &apos;t get some candy .
you don &apos;t say ?
right here on the ground .
i think i might pass out .
he &apos;s turning red .
i think he needs a sugar rush .
ok , all right , kid . you got 30 seconds .
thank you . good man !
make it quick .
12 seconds ! let &apos;s go !
come on .
you saved a life today , mr . rango .
they should give you a medal of honor .
it &apos;s called dinner .
let &apos;s go .
let &apos;s go .
no ! no ...
hey . i thought i &apos;d lend you a hand .
ah , rossi . brought a little something to drink .
i like that .
well , you can &apos;t do renovation
without a little bevvy .
wait a minute , now . you know i don &apos;t renovate .
i restore . there &apos;s a big difference .
i actually think there used to be some shutters here
once upon a time .
i &apos;m hoping they &apos;re upstairs in the attic .
i want to see what i can do with them .
well , why don &apos;t we start with a couple glasses ?
that i can definitely do .
flag on the play .
yeah ?
ok , baby girl , we &apos;ll be right there .
e la vita .
so ...
two men have been killed on the southside of chicago
in the last 10 days .
the first is michael crowley .
he was a repairman who was out jogging pretty late at night .
second , anthony rango
he was a convenience store owner .
no known connection between them .
both men were beaten to death with fists of fury .
rango suffered a crushed larynx
and something called a le fort fracture ?
it &apos;s a bilateral horizontal facial injury .
looks like there was also
a blunt force trauma to the back of the head .
so they were blitz attacked to gain control ,
then it was essentially fisticuffs .
and they were both literally caught with their pants down .
like their jeans and their boxers
both down to their ankles .
but there &apos;s no sign of sexual assault or robbery .
so it was a message .
either they led secret lives
or someone wanted to symbolically demean or embarrass them .
you can &apos;t really tell if it was done pre- or postmortem .
aren &apos;t these your old stomping grounds ?
we should go say hey to your family .
yeah , i &apos;m not gonna let anybody know i &apos;m in town .
at least not until we &apos;re done with this .
i don &apos;t need any distractions .
with this level of hands @-@ on violence ,
this unsub is filled with rage .
and he &apos;s probably just getting started .
wheels up in 30 .
i am dead ,
only vengeance can restore me .
terry goodkind .
all right , let &apos;s go over victimology .
both of these men were medium @-@ risk victims .
they were average joes making a living
in a below average area .
the first victim , crowley , was a telephone repairman
who &apos;d living in the neighborhood for years .
victim two , rango ,
owned a convenience store for about twice as long ,
and he had pretty much the same routine every single day .
so each had a pattern .
it looks that way . they both had regular work hours .
crowley &apos;s wife said he varied his workout route .
this was the first time that he ran this way .
he seems more like a victim of opportunity ,
while the store owner &apos;s death seems planned .
the pants pulled down means the unsub &apos;s message is personal .
you know , 98 % of the area is black ,
but the two victims he attacked were white men
who &apos;d lived in the neighborhood for years .
maybe he wanted to shame them in some way .
this doesn &apos;t look like a hate crime .
removing the pants is sexual , it &apos;s not racial .
garcia , did you get any information
about the sexuality of the victims ?
as far as i can tell , rango was straight .
he was married 30 years , two grown kids .
no internet or credit card history suggests otherwise .
and what about the jogger ?
if he was living on the dl ,
i can &apos;t find the d or the l.
somehow the unsub linked the two .
morgan , you know the neighborhood .
you and blake go to the minimart .
the rest of us will go to the p.d.
how far away from here did you grow up ?
5 blocks . the park we just passed
is where i used to play football .
the bus stop on that corner--
that &apos;s where i played kissy @-@ face
with my first girlfriend .
how old were you ?
10 .
yeah . our unsub blitz attacked the owner .
he must have regained consciousness
and put up a hell of a fight .
yeah , it looks that way .
baby girl , see if the owner of the convenience store
had any military defensive training .
oh , i will , as long as you promise to bring me
some of my future mother @-@ in @-@ law &apos;s peach cobbler .
as soon as we &apos;re done here , i promise .
all right .
wow , mr. esp ,
rango was an amateur mma fighter
in the local &quot; over 50 &quot; division in his spare time .
he had a 10 and 1 record ,
he was training for a big fight in june .
tough old man . thank you .
so we were right ?
but to intentionally pick a fight with a martial artist ?
maybe our unsub didn &apos;t know ?
rango could have been the victim of opportunity ,
like the jogger .
well , it looks like our guy needed a drink after the beatdown .
he must have worn gloves ,
otherwise csi would have taken them in for the prints .
so he could have been an addict .
maybe that explains the intensive nature .
you ever known an addict to leave a full register ?
and this guy was mission oriented .
he even stole the disc before he left .
candy and soda were the last things bought .
there were probably kids in here .
they &apos;re lucky they didn &apos;t get hurt .
detective gordinski .
captain , actually .
i was promoted two years ago .
you remember dr. reid .
ah , what &apos;s it been , 6 , 7 years ?
the number of pathogens passed during a handshake is staggering .
it &apos;s actually safer to kiss .
ah , yeah , i do remember you .
any developments in the investigation ?
while you were in the air , another body dropped outside
a local diner on halstead .
guy &apos;s pants were pulled down , he was beaten to a pulp .
we had some team members headed to the morgue .
we &apos;ll redirect them to the diner instead .
thank you .
guy over there found him .
at first he thought he was homeless ,
but then something didn &apos;t seem right .
beaten to death wouldn &apos;t seem right whether he had a home or not .
yeah , that &apos;s true .
surveillance camera caught him eating with his son at the diner .
then he passed the kid off to his mom and they took off .
this is odd . it &apos;s a high @-@ traffic area .
the first two kills took place in seclusion .
the unsub is a highly motivated risk @-@ taker .
what race was the victim ?
african @-@ american .
a change in m.o. , too . he crossed the color line .
he &apos;s an equal opportunity killer .
empty bottle of wine .
that &apos;s new .
what do you see ?
hey , what &apos;s up ? you find anything in the alley ?
yeah , there &apos;s some writing on the dumpster .
what &apos;s it say ?
hold on a second .
they got something ?
do you see something ?
morgan .
&quot; look up to the sky &quot; ?
i gotta go .
linguistically , it may mean
god judges the victim for his sins ...
that &apos;s not it .
and taken in context , with the pants pulled--
blake , that &apos;s not it .
let &apos;s go .
knock on every door .
everyone gets overtime tonight . ok ?
derek morgan .
where &apos;s hotch ?
he &apos;s in the conference room .
the m.e. found glass shards from a helgeson vineyards
wine bottle in the back of victim number 3 &apos;s skull .
i know what this is about .
this is about carl buford .
what do you mean ? buford &apos;s in prison for life .
the words &quot; look up to the sky &quot;
were found in both the minimart and the alley .
it &apos;s what buford used to say to me .
look up to the sky !
look up to the sky !
look up to the sky !
carl buford was an expert .
at spotting and exploiting vulnerabilities
in adolescent boys that he coached at the community center .
he had the entire community thinking he was a hero .
parents , teachers ... cops .
i mean everyone .
after my dad died , he locked onto me .
and he manipulated me into compliant victimization .
now , you remember how i told you that i got into it
with that local gangbanger when i was younger .
well , somehow buford got it all expunged .
now , i didn &apos;t understand
why a guy who barely knew me would do that .
buford gave me his time .
he taught me how to play football .
and then he took me to his cabin on the lake .
i was a kid .
i was a kid from the southside .
i &apos;d never been to a cabin , much less a lake .
morgan , you don &apos;t have to do this .
they need to know , hotch .
they need to know this guy &apos;s m.o ..
buford built up my trust .
and then he would lower my inhibition with helgeson wine .
he called it his jesus juice .
then he would molest me .
and every time he would see that dead look in my eyes
that said i wanted him to stop ...
he would just say , &quot; you better man up , boy . &quot;
&quot; look up to the sky . &quot;
did you ever tell anyone about that phrase ?
no .
we &apos;re probably looking at someone who buford abused .
the victim could harbor a great deal of anger
if he didn &apos;t deal with his own abuse .
and with the right trigger ,
it could develop into this kind of rage .
where &apos;s buford now ?
we got him locked up for homicide in 2006,
but because of the statute of limitations ,
we never got him for molestation .
buford ran the community center for years .
an offender like him could have hundreds of victims .
all right , let &apos;s talk about victimology .
each of these men had had interactions with kids
right before they were killed .
the killer switched from white victims to african @-@ americans .
you &apos;d think that if they were surrogates for buford ,
he &apos;d kill only black men .
hello ? garcia , i need you to compile a list
of all of the boys who played football at the community center
20 @-@ 30 years ago .
ok .
i knew about buford molesting morgan ,
but there were more kids ?
preferential offenders typically have dozens of victims .
and each reacts differently .
morgan became an fbi agent and this one went the other way .
you know , had i known back in the day
that morgan was going through all this ,
i wouldn &apos;t have arrested him 6 years ago .
and i sure wouldn &apos;t have been so hard on him as a kid .
i know .
let us go deliver the profile
and stop this guy from killing anybody else .
the man that we &apos;re looking for is an africanamerican male
in his late 30s to early 40s , and he &apos;s from this area .
he most likely attended
the local community center as a youth .
he &apos;s athletic and he &apos;s powerful ,
which explains his ability
to overcome his victims with aggression .
his perfect timing and selection
say his intelligence level is high ,
and his victim selection shows us his murders
are not planned in advance .
he may have a drinking problem ,
which makes him more unpredictable
and exacerbates his anger .
come on , now , i &apos;m his father !
the fact that he doesn &apos;t steal from his victims
shows us that he &apos;s mission oriented .
this says that the substance abuse is a coping mechanism ,
from the fact that he never
adequately dealt with his own victimization .
by exposing his victims and scrawling the phrase
buford used during his sexual assaults
at the crime scenes ,
he &apos;s telling the world that he sees the victims
as child molesters ,
which is his justification for killing them .
this is an example of projection and polarization ,
a black @-@ and @-@ white thinking
which when coupled with impulsivity , anger ,
and outbursts of violence indicates
that this unsub &apos;s most likely suffering from an extreme case
of borderline personality disorder .
bpd is one of the most common
mental disorders suffered by adults
who were victimized as children .
this represents the borderline between anxiety and psychosis .
we believe this unsub &apos;s perspective has become so warped
that he &apos;s likely experiencing stress @-@ related paranoid ideation ,
most likely brought on by a recent traumatic event
that triggered that rage .
no !
he &apos;s killing men just after
they innocently interact with children .
so step up patrols in parks ,
schools , ball fields , even family events .
but do not try to confront this man alone .
we believe that he is armed and extremely dangerous .
thank you .
go ahead , garcia .
i &apos;m gonna start with the good news first &apos; cause i wanna .
the renamed damien walters community center is thriving
under its new director ,
ms. walters , damien &apos;s mom .
the bad news is , although they now computerize their records ,
back when buford ran the joint
it was all paper files , so i &apos;m out of luck there .
all right , thanks , garcia .
jj , why don &apos;t you get reid
and go over to the center , dive into those files ,
see if you can come up with a comprehensive list
of buford &apos;s potential victims .
i actually know one of them personally .
his name is james barfield .
he &apos;s a senior at northwestern .
i might be able to get something out of him .
ok . you and blake go over there ,
see what you can find out .
derek morgan just called to give me a heads @-@ up .
the records are in the back .
thanks .
you know , community centers
are supposed to bring people together ,
but this one has torn enough people apart .
i &apos;ll be up front , if you need anything .
thank you .
i hear they &apos;re talking first round , huh ?
oh , snap .
derek morgan .
that &apos;s right .
what are you doing here , derek ?
mr. fbi ain &apos;t come to wish me luck .
carl buford .
hey , man , you need to leave that alone .
someone &apos;s killing men in our old neighborhood .
what else is new ?
well , because of certain evidence found at the crime scenes ,
we believe it &apos;s one of buford &apos;s former victims .
you told her ?
james , we just need to figure out who &apos;s doing this .
you should be hitting the pavement figuring it out ,
not wasting time talking to me .
james , you &apos;re not a suspect .
we just need to identify the other men .
look , did buford ever mention any special guys ,
guys closer to my age ?
i can &apos;t help you .
if we don &apos;t get a list of names ,
someone else could lose their life .
is that really what you want ?
let me break this down for you , j. crew .
i ain &apos;t no snitch . i &apos;m not telling you
what another man &apos;s gone through .
james , just give us some names and nobody has to know about this .
i &apos;m not starting my football career
carrying that mess around .
i &apos;m about to get out of these streets .
i &apos;m not doing it , derek .
all right , dr. genius , do you notice anything i &apos;m not seeing ?
between travel receipts , letters of recommendation , and expense reports ,
i &apos;ve compiled a list of several names ,
but it &apos;s obvious there are gaps in the records .
do you think buford
destroyed some files before he went to prison ?
given the opportunity , most people in his situation would have .
we should probably call the team with this .
hotch , james couldn &apos;t give us any names .
reid and jj were only able to come up with a partial list
from the files at the community center ,
so we &apos;ll talk to those guys ,
we &apos;ll see if anybody stands out
or if they can fill in the gaps .
it could take days or weeks to track them down .
i need to go see buford .
i want you to try something with jj first .
all right , derek ,
i just need you to relax .
just try to remember .
jj , come on ,
i taught you the &quot; you &apos;re in a safe place now &quot; speech .
well , i should be pretty damn good at it .
all right .
so i need you to think back
to the sights and sounds and smells of playing football .
we were some sweaty , dirty , smelly kids back then .
all we ever wanted to do was to get out there and play the game .
was buford there ?
yeah .
did you notice any unusual glances
or behavior between him and any of the other boys ?
no .
buford never took his eyes off of me .
come on , derek , focus , focus .
did you notice if any of the boys avoided him subtly ?
good job , d. that &apos;s my boy .
nothing .
i had always thought i was the only one .
jj , this isn &apos;t working . i &apos;m done .
i don &apos;t want you going to see buford .
hotch , i can handle it .
another man was found beaten to death .
same m.o. 10 blocks from the last murder .
that &apos;s 4 in two weeks .
and take blake with you .
hotch , come on . we gotta do this now .
i finished my counseling two years ago .
i can do this .
all right , but i &apos;m coming with you .
all these years
i kept my mouth shut .
carl buford , my mentor .
look at you . you &apos;d probably be dead by now .
yeah , well , it wasn &apos;t for free , was it ?
i pulled you out of the gutter .
i pulled myself out of the gutter ,
all the way to the fbi . i did that !
you saying i had nothing to do with making you who you are ?
no , carl .
actually , i &apos;m saying you have everything to do with making me who i am .
open gate .
close gate .
derek morgan .
got yourself a new look , huh ?
i &apos;m mohammed alam now .
of all my boys , you &apos;re the last one
that i thought would come back to me .
4 men have been killed in the old neighborhood , carl .
allah view murder as a sin and an abomination .
at each crime scene the words &quot; look up to the sky &quot; were found .
you remember those words .
they escape me .
i &apos;ve been very busy filling my brain with knowledge .
i &apos;m a malcolm x islamic scholar now .
i know you remember that cabin .
and me and every other boy
that you took up there remembers it , too .
the man you harbor so much rage for is no longer here .
yes , he is .
he &apos;s sitting right in front of me .
you &apos;re just hiding behind a religion that hasn &apos;t figured you out yet .
still got that mouth on you , don &apos;t you ?
always liked that mouth .
you were always direct .
whenever i see you on tv ,
i tell everyone that &apos;s my boy .
i &apos;m proud of you .
i don &apos;t give a damn how you feel .
you see , what i need
is a list of everyone you &apos;ve victimized .
you still like mint chocolate @-@ chip ice cream ?
the u.s. attorney has offered immunity .
they won &apos;t charge you with molesting any of the boys on this list
as long as this list is complete .
or was it butter pecan ?
you leave even one name off that list , this deal is dead .
are you threatening me , d. ?
with my hand on the qu &apos;ran .
see , right now , you &apos;re in here for serial murder .
and i bet that gives you a whole lot of credit out there in the yard . am i right ?
but what do you think would happen if the brothers in here
learned what you were really guilty of ?
so let me be direct ,
mohammed .
start writing .
some people are easy to remember ,
but others sort of fade to the background .
that doesn &apos;t mean they weren &apos;t special .
they just weren &apos;t like you , derek .
i &apos;ll give you the list on one condition .
all i want is a handshake . that &apos;s it .
a gentleman &apos;s agreement .
what do you say ?
you were always special , derek .
you may have me in here ,
but there &apos;s a whole lot more of me out there , boy .
you didn &apos;t have to shake his hand .
it &apos;s a long list , hotch .
this unsub &apos;s devolving .
he &apos;ll stand out . he won &apos;t be hard to find .
i &apos;m gonna use the head before we leave .
i have arrested every one of these kids .
i never once thought they were getting molested .
some victims of sexual abuse
tell their parents and others act out .
i cross @-@ referenced the list of special kids from the center
with the list of victims morgan got from buford .
i &apos;ve come up with a half a dozen names
of people who fit the profile and the physicality to be suspects .
did you get that list to garcia ?
she &apos;s pulling their histories right now .
yeah , baby girl , how &apos;s that list coming along ?
ok . of the 5 that fit the profile ,
one sticks out like a tiger in a room of kittens .
what name &apos;s that ?
keron bender .
he &apos;s a former linebacker .
he was on buford &apos;s community center team .
he &apos;s a few years older than derek . he &apos;s come upon hard times .
by that i mean he has 3 arrests for domestic violence ,
two for meth possession and aggravated assault ,
and he lives smack in the middle of the kill zone .
send that address right now . let &apos;s go .
sent .
police !
i got him !
weed , it &apos;s just weed . it &apos;s just weed .
i told you , i don &apos;t know nobody .
i just want you to look at this list .
all right ? just look at it .
are there any other guys around our age who aren &apos;t on here who
buford treated as special ?
well , how am i supposed to know ?
you tryin &apos; to kick a brother when he down .
buford used to tell you to look up to the sky , right ?
i need your help .
just look at the list .
i recognize a few of those guys .
but there was older ones , though ,
before that .
at the center .
no .
cabrini green .
buford used to live there before--
he was tight with the king cobras .
he used to tell their moms
that he would keep them off the streets .
yeah . i used to bump heads with a few of them .
you got any names ?
yeah .
there was one .
he was buford &apos;s favorite .
who ?
pretty sure his name was rodney .
rodney harris ?
yeah .
he got it the worst .
rodney &apos;s not on this list .
buford played us .
he was one of the biggest drug dealers
in the neighborhood 6 years ago .
yeah , but he fell out . he &apos;s not running that anymore .
rodney &apos;s the one you had all the trouble with , right ?
yeah . yeah , that &apos;s right .
this is all starting to make sense now .
buford probably let him deal drugs close to the center
just to keep him quiet about what buford had done .
and rodney looked at you and saw everything he could have been .
yeah , but what made him snap now ?
yeah , garcia , see if there &apos;s a connection between rodney harris
and any of our victims .
i already did that , babe , and i &apos;m coming up empty .
what about rodney &apos;s extended family ?
there &apos;s a connection .
ok , uh , michael crowley-- he &apos;s the first victim--
he was a swim coach to tyler harris .
that &apos;s rodney &apos;s estranged son .
so sheila , rodney &apos;s ex @-@ wife ,
pulled tyler from the swim team .
turns out she made quite a scene , rightfully so ,
because ...
crowley had molested him after a swim meet .
so crowley was killed out of revenge .
rango and the others , who had simple interaction with children ,
were just surrogates for carl buford .
you got an address for rodney ?
i traced rodney &apos;s cell phone
and it &apos;s pinging at the current address of sheila goode .
that &apos;s rodney &apos;s ex @-@ wife .
yeah , but why would you spend that kind of money
on something like that ?
it &apos;s your money .
i love it .
don &apos;t you move .
oh , my god .
rodney ...
shut up !
shut up !
what are you doing ?
shut up !
why ? !
move back .
come here , tyler .
rodney , what &apos;s wrong with you ?
you gonna go and be with him ?
with him ? you--
oh ! rodney , what &apos;s the hell &apos;s wrong with you ? !
dad , please !
i just saved you , boy .
what did you do , rodney ? !
shut up !
what did you do ? !
you sure ?
yeah .
he &apos;s agitated .
rossi , you guys take the back .
rodney , please don &apos;t do this .
rodney , i &apos;m coming in !
rodney ?
get out of here , derek .
i can &apos;t do that .
i will kill him .
you kill him , you die .
he &apos;s innocent .
he took my family .
he didn &apos;t protect my son .
that &apos;s not true .
it is !
rodney , this has nothing to do with him .
this is about what happened to you .
what ?
carl buford .
i know what he did to you back in the day .
son of a bitch .
son of-- you don &apos;t know me .
you don &apos;t know what i &apos;ve been through .
you better back up or i will kill him .
oh , rodney , please .
you shut up .
rodney !
this is all your fault , anyway .
you took my son away from me .
you can &apos;t keep killing people , man .
what happened to your son was wrong .
but it brought you back to what buford did to you , didn &apos;t it ?
look , i know exactly what you &apos;re feeling ,
because i &apos;ve been there .
how i &apos;m feeling ?
you have no idea how i &apos;m feeling .
you &apos;re just a bitch @-@ ass narc .
i &apos;m in these streets .
hell , i &apos;m already dead .
no !
no , that &apos;s what carl buford always wanted you to believe .
don &apos;t you see that ? that &apos;s how he controlled you .
and if you pull that trigger , he wins .
no , buford ain &apos;t got nothin &apos; on me .
i know he molested you .
nah .
man , stop talking .
why didn &apos;t you tell me , rodney ?
just stop talkin &apos; .
why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
shut up ! shut your mouth .
rodney , look at me .
he did the same thing to me .
i confronted him .
i got him locked away for life .
he &apos;s done .
done ?
done ain &apos;t good enough .
look at your son .
look at him .
don &apos;t go out like this in front of him .
you don &apos;t want to destroy his life , too , do you ?
rodney , he loves you .
i do , dad .
he still needs you .
he still needs you , rodney .
rodney ...
put that gun down .
you know , the only reason i became a cop
was so i could tell right from wrong .
get bad off the streets , only the good was standing .
but i got it wrong .
not just with you but with all these kids .
i ... made assumptions about who they were ,
why they did what they did .
people like buford i let slide .
i &apos;m sorry .
what drove you to kill those men ?
clear the way , please .
is it true that this is all about carl buford ?
why did you do it ?
comment , please !
you don &apos;t have to do this . i got it .
derek , i got it .
i used to think that , uh , carl buford was a hero .
6 years ago i found out i was very wrong .
derek .
it &apos;s over .
you did it .
you &apos;re saying that &apos;s why rodney harris killed those men ?
yes , that &apos;s what i said .
so being abused made him a killer ?
no .
no , it did not .
the vast majority of child sex victims
don &apos;t grow up to be sex offenders or criminals .
i know this because ...
and let me be direct ...
i was also one of carl buford &apos;s victims .
yo , mohammed , wasn &apos;t &quot; carl buford &quot; your government name ?
victimization does not cause offending .
yeah . i don &apos;t know what he &apos;s talking about .
i loved that kid .
it can cause a lot of isolation ...
and there can be anger and rage .
it can cause pain and suffering ...
but you can get through it .
