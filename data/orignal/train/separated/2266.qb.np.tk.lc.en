everyone take a ribbon . as long as we hold these ribbons ,
we will be there for each other .
it was an accident . please , gerda .
you killed our sister . you &apos;re a monster .
who is that ? another friend ?
i don &apos;t remember any of this .
bloody hell . is that ...
yeah .
this spell of yours ...
it &apos;ll bring out the darkness in everyone in this town .
it &apos;ll do more than that .
they will tear themselves apart until everyone is dead .
you have traveled a great distance ,
but i can help you .
madame faustina is here .
sorceress ,
can you use your powers of crystal gazing
to show me a girl not yet born ?
this girl is special to you ?
very much so .
at the age of 28,
she will arrive in a town called storybrooke .
madame faustina knows all . come .
the crystal ball awaits .
how will you express your gratitude ?
thank you .
payment . how -- how will you pay me ?
will this do ?
spirits of the ball ,
hear me and obey .
i see ... a child .
yes .
a girl ...
who is ... special .
yes . she has many gifts . tell me more .
the child &apos;s name is ...
susan .
liar !
her name will be emma swan !
the apprentice &apos;s scroll promises this !
i don &apos;t know nothin &apos; about a scroll .
now get outta here or you &apos;re gonna get a wicked beating .
where i &apos;m from ,
charlatans such as yourself are severely punished .
last warning , fruitcake . hit the bricks .
your trickery changes nothing .
i will find emma .
she is coming , and i will find her .
and i will wait for her as long as i must .
and then i will have what i deserve .
he &apos;s coming ! he &apos;s coming !
and i ain &apos;t happy !
prince charming .
finally i &apos;ve seen you clearly .
and what do you see ?
a fraud .
a shepherd who has no business being royalty .
well , i see a spoiled little princess
who ran away from her troubles ,
who always runs away !
i can &apos;t believe i had a child with you .
oh , who knows ? maybe you didn &apos;t .
could be whale .
you know , if this is what marriage is like ,
i &apos;m glad you keep postponing ours .
you don &apos;t mean that , kristoff . it &apos;s the spell .
no . i &apos;m seeing clearly now , too .
i &apos;m beginning to think that this haircut wasn &apos;t my only bad idea .
i know this isn &apos;t really you . i know it .
but it &apos;s still upsetting , so i &apos;m just ...
i &apos;m gonna go see my sister .
and you just stay here handcuffed
where you can &apos;t hurt anybody ... but me ... with your words .
my parents -- that &apos;s not who they are .
they &apos;re their worst selves .
it &apos;s like when anna put me in that urn .
she didn &apos;t mean what she said either ... i hope .
i didn &apos;t . that doesn &apos;t make any of this less horrible .
it &apos;s okay . you &apos;re immune . we all are . and we &apos;re together .
it &apos;s gonna be all right . remember , i &apos;m the savior .
that &apos;s , like , a real job here ?
apparently , it is .
i promised all these people i &apos;d get them their happy endings .
and i will . i &apos;m just not sure how at this moment .
i think i might have an idea .
do you know how the snow queen got the idea for the curse ?
it &apos;s from a legend called the trolden glass .
never heard of it .
its origin isn &apos;t important .
what matters is how they broke the curse .
what was done ?
to break the spell ...
they had to kill the king .
so in this case , that would mean ingrid .
i don &apos;t believe killing is ever the answer .
are you sure we can &apos;t reason with her ?
she &apos;s beyond that .
we all want another way ,
but if it comes down to her or the town ,
i &apos;m gonna do what has to be done .
but ...
we &apos;re out of options .
anna , how are you with kids ?
i love kids .
wait .
elsa , we should get going .
wait . i &apos;m the babysitter ?
the snow queen is my aunt , too .
if this is what has to happen , i wanna be by your side .
anna , sorry , but someone has to stay here with everyone else .
emma &apos;s right . stay with kristoff .
but this was my plan .
i know it was .
you &apos;re the smartest person i know ,
and you &apos;re my sister , which means you need to stay safe .
ingrid is a problem that emma and i have to solve .
do you trust emma ?
i do . she &apos;s my friend .
then go .
god !
sealed in my own vault ? !
this is ...
this is ...
this is the savior &apos;s doing .
i should &apos;ve incinerated her years ago .
this is what i get for being subtle !
what the hell am i wearing ?
i &apos;ve missed you .
where &apos;s the missus ?
she turned homicidal on you yet ?
none of your business . what kept you ?
well , it &apos;s like swimming with sharks out there .
the minute one of them tastes blood ,
they &apos;ll tear each other apart .
well , count your blessings you &apos;re not one of them .
why was i spared the cloud &apos;s curse ?
because your heart wasn &apos;t in your chest , dearie .
it was here in my shop with me .
in protective custody , so to speak .
what is it you need , crocodile ?
once i finish packing ,
i &apos;m gonna take belle to the town line .
i need you to find henry and do the same thing .
so you still think you &apos;re leaving ?
oh , ye of little faith .
tomorrow night , when the stars in the sky
align with the stars in the hat ,
i shall finally cleave myself from this dagger
and be on the other side of that ice wall before dawn .
are you saying there &apos;s a bloody way out of here ?
dark one always finds a way .
well , if the dark one is so powerful ,
why doesn &apos;t he magic his grandson to his side ?
because that would require me knowing
where his mothers have locked him away for safekeeping .
now unless you really , really have no need for that tongue ,
i suggest you slither back outside into the hostile current
and find henry .
you &apos;ll be needing this .
you won &apos;t win .
villains never do .
don &apos;t be ridiculous , dearie .
when belle and henry wake up tomorrow morning in new york city ,
they won &apos;t remember a thing about tonight .
i &apos;ll tell them the snow queen destroyed storybrooke ,
whilst i saved everyone i could .
i won &apos;t be a villain .
i &apos;ll be a hero .
stop .
this must end , ingrid .
our magic is a part of us now .
we control it , and we control it really well .
i &apos;m so proud of you both .
you &apos;ve finally embraced who you truly are .
emma .
again .
the love that flows through our ribbons
is without equal .
its strength protects the life @-@ force
that we all now share .
she &apos;s made it impossible for us to hurt her .
we gotta get these things off .
there &apos;s no need .
soon ,
you won &apos;t want to hurt me .
soon ,
you will love me .
for real .
hey , look what the new girl brought with her .
give it to me !
give it back , kevin .
the camera is emma &apos;s , not yours .
we respect property in this household , don &apos;t we , kevin ?
yes , ma &apos;am .
here you go , emma .
it &apos;s okay , sweetie .
i know you &apos;re new here , but you &apos;re gonna be just fine .
okay , lights out in 15 !
don &apos;t forget to brush your teeth !
it &apos;s your choice , sweetie .
you can either give me that camera tomorrow
or i can make your life a living hell .
i made us some cocoa .
wanna join me ?
no .
suit yourself .
you know , by my account ,
there are 15 separate subconscious signs or tells
that a new foster child displays when they &apos;re going to run away
on his or her first night .
in the brief time we were together ,
you showed seven .
not that i blame you .
when i was younger , i did the same thing .
you ran away ?
i tried to .
people in my life , they , uh , they intervened .
do you wanna know why ?
does it matter ?
it did to me .
they stopped me because they cared about me .
lucky you .
no . lucky you .
because now that you &apos;re living under my roof ,
i &apos;m gonna care for you the way they cared for me .
yeah , well , don &apos;t waste your time .
i &apos;m not interested .
suit yourself .
go . i won &apos;t stop you .
you won &apos;t ?
no . go on . more cocoa for me .
i understand how difficult it must be
to live under the same roof as someone like kevin ,
who &apos;s deathly afraid of spiders .
any spiders , really .
small spiders . big spiders .
even the rubber ones i keep in my desk .
in the drawer on the right .
behind the box of staples .
poor kevin .
it &apos;s a shame you can &apos;t stay , emma .
maybe ...
maybe i could hang around for one more day .
works for me .
gold ?
belle ?
you in here ?
they &apos;re gone .
then what do we do ?
we do it ourselves .
say something !
dopey , say something !
open your mouth ! speak , speak , speak !
move it !
that &apos;s ridiculous .
at least i know how to swaddle our child correctly .
i swaddle him perfectly .
he &apos;s a baby , not a breakfast burrito .
stop it . i mean , i have to say
i expected more from the two of you .
use your heads .
think back to what it was like before the spell changed you .
sure , you had issues with each other , but they were minor .
minor ? minor ?
when i first met her , she hit me in the face .
if that wasn &apos;t a sign , i don &apos;t know what is .
yes , you responded by hanging me in net from a tree .
you &apos;re a real prince charming .
yes , he is prince charming , and you &apos;re snow white .
and those things sound terrible but they also sound romantic .
can &apos;t you see that ?
&apos;cause if you can see that ,
then maybe you can defeat this dark spell .
someone slip me a poison apple and put me out of my misery .
oh ! me ! pick me !
oh , shut it , ice man .
ice man ? who you calling ice man , stable boy ?
i &apos;m calling you ice man . and you &apos;re from arendelle .
what are you doing selling ice ?
the whole place is frozen !
ice is a very important commodity .
you know what , swiss miss ? you do know me .
i pick flowers . i talk to birds .
i do all kinds of warm , fuzzy things .
and you know what else ?
i kill .
yeah , that &apos;s right .
snow white &apos;s a murderer .
i killed the evil queen &apos;s mommy .
and i said i was sorry ...
and it didn &apos;t mean it .
that &apos;s horrible .
still wanna hold hands , sing &quot; zip @-@ a @-@ dee @-@ doo @-@ dah &quot; ?
i give up . it &apos;s useless .
the magic protecting this ribbon is just too powerful .
i guess the snow queen meant what she said about her love .
i &apos;m sorry . i was too busy thinking of ways to punch her
to retain that .
she &apos;s said the love flowing through our ribbons
was without equal .
maybe without equal ,
but not without an opposite that &apos;s equally strong .
what ?
if her amplified love put these ribbons on our wrists ,
then maybe what we need
is someone &apos;s equally amplified hatred to get them off .
emma , you &apos;re a bit prickly ,
but you &apos;re certainly not hateable .
tell that to regina .
i &apos;m prickly ?
if you let regina out
while she &apos;s under the influence of the snow queen &apos;s curse ,
she &apos;ll kill you .
she &apos;ll try . but right now , it &apos;s ...
a theory .
the best chance we have .
if storybrooke wants to survive ,
regina needs to hate me like she &apos;s never hated me before .
what do i do ? help !
don &apos;t look at me ! you &apos;re driving !
i can &apos;t do it .
concentrate .
okay . okay .
okay .
trust your instincts
and let it rip .
don &apos;t let go .
win .
yes !
let &apos;s see what you won .
i love it .
this is a great lesson , emma .
if you push yourself and you ignore the flickering lights
and the distractions of this world ,
you can accomplish anything .
ingrid , it &apos;s a plastic ring , not a scholarship to yale .
i know , but you &apos;re a special girl , emma .
and someday , you &apos;re gonna surprise everybody
with your extraordinary gifts .
okay , now you &apos;re going overboard .
i &apos;m serious .
i &apos;m glad i got to know you .
ingrid , are -- are you crying ?
no , just ...
a little emotional .
i &apos;m being sent away again .
what ?
that &apos;s why we spent the day together .
no .
it &apos;s why you &apos;re crying .
no . you couldn &apos;t be more wrong .
then what is it ?
i &apos;m ...
i &apos;m filling out the paperwork to adopt you .
we &apos;re gonna be a family .
are you serious ?
i know that it &apos;s a big leap .
and you may not look at me as a mother .
i know how hard that is . but ...
i @-@ i promise
i will be the best big sister
that you could ever hope for .
i love you .
i love you , too .
okay , stand back .
containment spell . okay .
here goes .
you can do it .
okay .
well , i &apos;m still getting the hang
of the controlling the magic thing .
but lucky for us , the next part should be easy for me .
what &apos;s that ?
be prickly .
whoa . little late for halloween .
you .
how do you walk in that thing ?
with the poise and composure of a queen .
perfect timing , miss swan .
i was just reading up on how to turn you into a garden topiary .
what &apos;s she doing here ?
i wanted to see your face when you learned the truth .
the truth about what ?
i lied to you , regina , about marian .
i knew all along . i brought her here on purpose .
tell me something i don &apos;t know .
what you don &apos;t know is why .
not only did i wanna break your heart ,
i wanted to see me and hook together ,
see the happiness you could never have ,
and ruin it again , just like my mother did .
i &apos;ve been waiting a long time for this .
let &apos;s go .
swan !
henry .
i know you &apos;re in there , mate .
i need you to come with me now .
there &apos;s no way i &apos;m going anywhere with a dirty pirate .
dirty ?
i bathe quite frequently , thank you very much .
i never liked you , and i like you even less
now that you and my mom are together .
emma used that word ? &quot; together &quot; ?
go !
okay .
henry , i need to bring you somewhere safe .
all right .
i &apos;m coming in !
henry !
i &apos;m just trying to do what &apos;s best for you !
i &apos;ve been looking for you , pirate .
come to pay you back for that shiner you gave me .
now &apos;s not the time , mate .
oh , it bloody well is the time !
now let &apos;s see how hard you are
without your girlfriend &apos; round to protect ya .
henry !
it &apos;s nights like this
i wish i just had the power to poof home like harry potter .
if i was like him ,
i could be standing here in the cold one minute ,
and home soaking in the tub in the next .
that would be something , wouldn &apos;t it ?
emma ...
emma , do you remember
how much fun we had in the arcade last week ?
of course . best day i &apos;ve had in a long time .
how could i forget ?
and do you remember
how the lights in the game flickered
right before you won ?
yeah . weird .
what if it was more than just weird ?
what if it meant that you were on the cusp
of a great self @-@ revelation ?
i think it &apos;s time .
what are you doing ? !
stop the car .
what ? !
trust your instincts .
do it ! stop the car !
let go of me !
emma !
i &apos;m sorry .
are you crazy ? ! you almost killed me !
i made a mistake .
when i was younger , i @-@ i had a traumatic experience
that unleashed a power that i @-@ i didn &apos;t even know that i had .
what are you talking about ?
i thought the arcade was a sign
that you were coming into your own .
you think i have powers ? like harry potter ?
no , emma . that &apos;s fiction .
what you have is more real and more powerful
than you can possibly imagine .
great .
i should &apos;ve known the only person willing to adopt me
would turn out to be a nut job .
no . emma -- - don &apos;t touch me !
i thought ...
emma , wait .
emma !
emma !
emma !
isn &apos;t this my lucky day ?
i had come here to kill emma ,
but now i get to kill
the two idiots who started it all .
hey , i wasn &apos;t the one
that told cora about your secret boyfriend .
are you selling me out ?
shut up !
you both deserve to die .
not just for what you did , but for your whining .
but your punishments should fit your crimes .
mary margaret , you took my first true love from me .
now i &apos;m going to return the favor
by taking your baby .
no !
regina !
please , your majesty , let &apos;s be reasonable .
you &apos;re under the snow queen &apos;s spell .
you don &apos;t actually hate mary margaret and david .
it does sound like she has her reasons .
kristoff !
i don &apos;t know who you are ,
but why don &apos;t you go back to where you came from ?
where was i ?
gonna use your magic , regina ?
you afraid to get your hands dirty ?
i don &apos;t need magic to kill you .
magic is too good for you .
i want to watch you bleed .
take this .
when the time comes ...
it will lead you to your third sister .
hello , storybrooke .
you two have no idea how long i &apos;ve waited for this moment .
your ribbons -- what have you done ?
i &apos;m not much for accessories .
those ribbons joined us together .
get it through your head , lady .
we &apos;re not your sisters and we &apos;re never gonna love you .
oh , emma .
i know that you actually believe that .
and ... it makes me sad .
but i know that sadness won &apos;t last
because soon , you &apos;ll see you &apos;re wrong .
don &apos;t do it !
the hell are those ?
they &apos;re memories i took from the two of you .
and now it &apos;s time to give them back .
why ? so we can remember just how badly you treated us ?
the funny thing about time is we romanticize the good
and forget the bad .
that &apos;s exactly what &apos;s in these crystals .
these are the good memories and nothing else .
lovely moments the two of you shared with me ,
which i &apos;ll cherish forever
and now so will you .
i hate to break it to you ,
but magic can &apos;t make someone love you .
you &apos;re right , emma . magic can &apos;t create love .
but if someone loved you in the past ,
it can make them love you again .
and i know you &apos;ve forgotten , emma ,
but you did love me .
you both did .
that &apos;s why ...
right now ,
you &apos;re not doing anything .
we all know the only way to stop me
is to kill me ,
and you &apos;re both ...
hesitating .
you don &apos;t have it in you .
still open ?
i need a couple of pints for my son . he loves this place .
ingrid .
emma .
what the hell are you doing here ?
e @-@ ever since you came to storybrooke ,
i &apos;ve been waiting for you to come into my shop .
i wanted to give you your space , let you come to me .
my space ? are you out of your mind ?
are you following me ?
there &apos;s so many things that i wanted to tell you ,
so many things that i wanted to say .
and look at you . you &apos;re all grown up .
don &apos;t touch me !
this makes no sense .
you don &apos;t look a day older . that was over 10 years ago .
after you ran away , i came to storybrooke to wait for you .
and people don &apos;t age here the way they do
in a world without magic .
the apprentice was right .
he said that you would be here on your 28th birthday ,
and here you are .
the apprentice ? magic ?
you &apos;re even loonier than when i ran away .
i &apos;m not , emma . you know that this place is special .
you know that you &apos;re special .
everything that henry is telling you is true .
no . i know you screwed up my life . you &apos;re crazy .
crazy then , crazy now ! you tried to kill me !
get out of my way . i &apos;m gonna call sheriff graham .
no , you &apos;re not calling anyone .
what &apos;s that , your pet rock ?
no , emma . no , it isn &apos;t .
it &apos;s magic from my world .
oh . you okay ?
what happened ?
you slipped . you almost fell .
do -- do you still want that ice cream ?
yeah . two pints of cherry vanilla .
how about some rocky road ?
uh , on the house . you look like you could use it .
have a taste .
now that is rocky road .
it &apos;s delicious .
wanna know my secret ?
lot of patience . lot of love .
careful ! the stroller &apos;s not under warranty anymore !
you said you bought it new !
it was gently used !
let me know when you &apos;re tired of missing , mary margaret .
i only have to hit you once .
my , my .
aren &apos;t you a good a sleeper ?
you think this spell has made me angry ?
do not wake my baby !
you said no magic .
and you said you could keep a secret !
i ... was ... 10 !
where did she send us ?
she tried to send us back to where we came from ,
and this was the closest spot .
where are you going ?
i &apos;m going back to arendelle , even if i have to swim there .
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s how portals work .
i mean , sure , i &apos;ve only ever been through one ,
but they seem pretty one @-@ way .
i &apos;m tired of this !
my life used to be simple --
just me and sven .
no sister @-@ in @-@ law who sets off eternal winters .
no crazy aunt who wants to kill everyone i know .
no fiancee who delays my wedding for 30 years !
that wasn &apos;t my fault .
okay , the first few weeks were ,
but we were frozen for the rest of it !
you know what ? i &apos;m tired of listening to you ,
and i &apos;m tired of listening to reason .
i &apos;m going back , and nothing you do will stop me !
sorry , kristoff , but you &apos;ll thank me later .
i &apos;ll make it up to you , i promise .
close your eyes .
kristoff .
kristoff , do you have any idea what this is ? !
oh . right . i knocked you out .
wake up ! we have to take this to elsa !
mwah ! i love you ! you &apos;re amazing !
you &apos;re unconscious .
i &apos;ll be right back . stay here .
i mean , i know you &apos;ll stay here ,
but i &apos;ll be be right back anyway !
it &apos;s okay .
come .
be my sisters .
i can &apos;t do it , emma . i can &apos;t hurt her .
yeah , well , i can .
wait !
stop !
anna !
no , she &apos;s too dangerous .
you should listen to my sister and go .
your sister ? she &apos;s mine .
and whatever you &apos;re gonna do ? well ...
don &apos;t .
elsa , i found this on the beach .
it &apos;s from our mother .
she must &apos;ve thrown it into the ocean
before their ship sank .
it came over in the portal with us .
oh , just be careful .
no , i &apos;m not gonna be careful . she needs to hear this .
you all do .
&quot; elsa , anna , i don &apos;t know
if your father and i will ever get back to you ,
but i need you to know
we were wrong to tell elsa to conceal her powers . &quot;
how fitting that you , who are so much like your mother ,
should share her last words .
&quot; i feel terrible that it happened before
and i can &apos;t let it happen again . &quot;
what ?
&quot; my sister ingrid , like you , also had ice powers .
i never told you about her or my other sister helga ,
but i should have .
they were beautiful and kind and wonderful ,
and i was fearful .
and i let that fear guide me .
i let ingrid hide
when i should have celebrated her for the person she was .
i loved her so much . &quot;
you &apos;re lying !
my sister hated me ! she called me a monster !
she put me in that urn , like you did elsa !
&quot; in this crystal are the memories of my sisters ,
which i stole from the people of arendelle .
please return them .
my sisters deserve to be known .
in a cave in the north valley ,
you &apos;ll find an urn that contains ingrid .
please do what i should have done long ago and release her .
when you see her , please tell her
i love her and i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;d give anything to take back what i did ,
to hold her hands one more time . &quot;
ingrid ! let her go !
i understand , aunt ingrid .
i understand now why you cast this curse .
but you can come back from it .
understand me ?
how could you ?
you &apos;re nothing like me !
you understand nothing !
you &apos;re right .
i &apos;m not like you . my mother wasn &apos;t like you .
but if she was able to love you for who you are , so can i.
you &apos;re a part of our family no matter what .
and family never gives up on each other .
you lie !
oh , gerda .
what have i done ?
i need to reverse this .
you can &apos;t .
the only way is if you ...
i know .
i have to destroy myself .
no , ingrid . wait !
there &apos;s no other way .
i am a monster ,
not because of my powers ,
but because of what i let them turn me into .
i have to undo this .
no , ingrid . you &apos;ll die .
i know .
it &apos;s okay .
elsa , anna ,
you found each other .
and , emma , you found your family ,
even if it wasn &apos;t with me .
you ...
you deserve your memories .
you three are so special .
never forget that .
there has to be another way .
you deserve your happy ending , too .
long ago ,
a prophecy told me
that you would lead me to just that , emma .
and this is it .
all i wanted
was to have my sister &apos;s love , and ...
now i have it .
now ...
i get to join them .
she sacrificed herself for us , for all of us .
anna .
elsa .
we must follow through on our mother &apos;s last wish .
we must bring back the memory of ingrid and helga
to the people of arendelle .
we will .
get off me !
don &apos;t you sneeze on me , you son of a gun !
what am i wearing ?
sorry i tried to kill you .
with a crossbow .
yeah . you tried to kill me with a crossbow .
emma !
mom !
henry .
and mom .
and he &apos;s finally waking .
look , i know that we were under the snow queen &apos;s curse , but --
we were under a curse .
it &apos;s okay .
henry got away .
so you failed .
at kidnapping a child .
well , perhaps you could say my heart wasn &apos;t in it .
the snow queen &apos;s plan also failed .
but mine won &apos;t .
enjoy this snowfall , dearie .
it &apos;ll be your last .
then grant me one dying wish .
i &apos;m not in the business of making deals with you anymore .
leave emma and the rest of storybrooke be .
there &apos;s no need to harm them .
when i step over that town line with my magic intact ,
emma and storybrooke have nothing to fear from me ...
as long as they don &apos;t get in my way .
but i can &apos;t make that same promise
for the rest of the world .
