sorry to startle you .
you didn &apos;t startle us .
yeah .
you stumbled for the locker for like 30 seconds .
i got a new job !
babe , that &apos;s great .
oh , that &apos;s awesome .
well , not really &quot; new . &quot;
i &apos;m starting on a trial basis tomorrow .
so where is it ?
is it at that super crunchy school ?
it &apos;s the most progressive school in los angeles .
it &apos;s basically heaven
if heaven were populated
with kids that look like tiny members of arcade fire .
sounds like your dream job .
i &apos;d give you a hug ,
but my shirt smells pretty weird today .
thank you . i was actually worried .
it was getting rough out there .
god , i miss paris .
stop it !
wha ... ? i was drinking that .
it &apos;s jess &apos;s .
every time she gets a job at a new school ,
she brings back kid germs
that infect your filthy body .
don &apos;t get me sick .
don &apos;t get me sick either , man .
i got a date coming up ,
and i might get to mouth @-@ base .
i &apos;m not gonna get sick .
no germ can live in a body that is 65 % beer .
nick , are you eating raisins from my purse ?
i confiscated those from a kid .
that explains why they &apos;re so sticky .
sticky nicky eats anything
and i don &apos;t get sick .
nick , you have , like , 7,500 raisins all over your room .
why would you eat the ... ?
i knew it . i knew it .
that was so immediate .
第五季 第十三集
and this is our nondenominational eden .
i know .
did the kids build the chicken coup ?
yep . only hens , though , obviously .
banyon canyon has a strict &quot; zero cocks &quot; policy .
i like how it ... it encourages the chickens to stay inside
but doesn &apos;t force them .
in line with our philosophy .
who are we to tell the children what to learn and when ?
their teachers ?
williamsburg ate my seaweed , genevieve .
no , i didn &apos;t .
don , williamsburg , do i have your permission
to move this conflict to the feelings farm ?
w @-@ wait , jess , we sit on the floor .
chairs are reserved for the children &apos;s feelings .
this is much better than solving problems the coolidge way .
there &apos;s a fight in the gym !
oh , my god !
i got this , jess .
fight ! fight ! fight ! fight !
i &apos;ve been thinking about starting to wear a watch again .
let me open the barn door and welcome honesty .
hi , honesty .
williamsburg , now , honesty is here
and has no agenda but to listen .
honesty , i ate the seaweed .
and i &apos;m sorry .
and , don , do you have anything to say to honesty ?
honesty , sorry for being so macho .
i &apos;m sorry i picked you last for touch basket .
i &apos;m sorry i insulted you for having a mommy and daddy .
beautiful , jess .
well done .
thank you .
into quarantine , you .
huge presentation at ass @-@ strat tomorrow ,
and i cannot be sick for it .
women i work with hate weakness .
you show up sick , you @-@ you might as well be dead .
uh , i &apos;m ... i &apos;m so sorry .
no , uh , it wasn &apos;t really ...
get out .
guys , i &apos;m on the mend .
sorry , nick .
winston here has got that hot coffee date tomorrow , so ...
but , to be clear , the date &apos;s hot , not the coffee .
uh , thinking about going iced .
don &apos;t look at my hands .
thanks for backing me up , boo .
oh , you know how boo do .
you know who &apos;s my boo ? i got a clue it &apos;s you .
so ...
this is the most time we &apos;ve ever spent alone .
pretty interesting observation on your part .
yeah .
what are we ... what are we watching ?
we are having a ...
i just started streaming it , and now it won &apos;t stop playing .
boy , ham sandwiches .
what is it ?
it &apos;s hard to say .
it &apos;s either a puppet show for kids ,
or it &apos;s north korean propaganda .
pretty weird .
i feel like we have a real connection .
me , too .
i know it &apos;s only the first day of your trial period ,
but my gut is telling me ...
you &apos;re a perfect fit .
i just-- like , i &apos;m so happy here , i could cry ,
but the gray water bucket &apos;s too far away ,
and i want to save my tears to water these plants .
that &apos;s considerate . ooh !
my partner &apos;s here to pick me up .
i think you &apos;re gonna really like him .
sorry i &apos;m late .
the string came out of my prayer beads ,
and they just bounced all over the office .
so frustrating .
sam , i want you to meet jess .
this is the candidate we were discussing in the shower .
yeah . jess , this is sam , my partner .
hey , jess .
you &apos;re a doctor for children .
uh , it &apos;s , you know , mostly paperwork .
how do you always look so beautiful in the morning ?
oh , my god .
you could have killed him .
i &apos;m gonna kick your ass , man .
hi , sam .
hi .
have you met before ?
we ... yeah , we &apos;ve met .
we did . yes , that &apos;s right , we met , we met .
how funny .
um , a bunch of times .
a lot of times . very many . a lot of times .
we met a lot ... yeah .
sometimes in the day , sometimes ...
in the , uh , nighttime .
it was , you know ...
yeah , we , i mean ...
bye , jess .
nice to see you .
the fly shirts and the even more fly shirts .
okay , let &apos;s make this quick .
i need to work on my presentation .
it &apos;s for a chair company , and it &apos;s tentatively titled ,
&quot; i hope you &apos;re sitting down for this . &quot;
&apos;cause it &apos;s chairs .
yeah .
at which point you would laugh
if you weren &apos;t so preoccupied with your date .
okay , winston , what are you wearing ?
well , you know , i don &apos;t want to overthink it .
it &apos;s just coffee , so ...
so you &apos;re going to just dress like you did today ,
which apparently happened during a solar eclipse
in a land of no mirrors .
good note . strong note .
winston , listen to me .
this is the first date
since the ... since the aly heartbreak .
this date is going to define
the next chapter of your dating story .
wear these magnificent sunglasses .
put &apos; em on .
oh , man .
you look like brad pitt on a tank .
in that movie furry .
you ever see furry ?
furry ? nah .
it &apos;s a bunch of dudes on a tank .
they &apos;re , uh ... and they &apos;re outnumbered .
and they shoot a bunch of people .
are they dressed in ... ?
you should check it out . just look it up , furry .
google &quot; furry , &quot; nice , yeah .
hey , don &apos;t screw up this date , it &apos;s important .
how is genevieve dating sam ?
is los angeles that small ?
you guys even listening to me ?
yeah , we &apos;re listening .
what @-@ what did queen ta ta say ?
well , the ball &apos;s tonight ,
and queen ta ta &apos;s got nothing to wear ,
so she &apos;s got to find a dress .
what the hell is this show ?
poppycock palace . it &apos;s amazing .
winston , when did you get sick ?
you were fine this morning .
oh , yeah , i &apos;m super sick .
genevieve just said , &quot; oh . &quot;
oh &apos;s , like , the worst .
what should i do ?
don &apos;t do anything .
just do nothing .
you &apos;re just gonna make it worse .
leave it alone , jess .
oh , i know .
i could go talk to sam .
i could ask him to put in a good word for me .
how long does it take to get over a breakup ?
two years ? two years is enough , right ?
i swear to god , just leave it alone .
let it lie .
do nothing , jess .
four votes for leaving it alone .
that &apos;s what i &apos;ll do .
i &apos;ll just do nothing .
i couldn &apos;t do nothing .
we must find this tee @-@ tee wah wah ...
humina humina humina humina ...
all these puppets do is sing about how they &apos;re friends .
i &apos;m starting to not believe them .
this is the best part .
the tee @-@ tee wah wah was in ...
it &apos;s in the damn pee @-@ paw playhouse !
shh .
spoiler alert , man .
the pee @-@ paw playhouse !
every time .
i &apos;ve been saying that for the past hour
&apos;cause i saw you put it in there !
you know what ? i can &apos;t .
i can not .
i &apos;m not sick .
i &apos;ve been faking it .
there you go , poppycock palace .
you &apos;ve outed me !
you &apos;re choosing to be in here ? why ?
&apos;cause i &apos;m freaking out about the date . okay ?
why don &apos;t you want to go on this date ?
because i &apos;m not over aly .
and i know i should be moving on
and this girl is okay , but she &apos;s not aly .
no one is aly .
what &apos;d she say ?
wait .
just hold .
oh , please don &apos;t blow your nose .
you do it so disgustingly .
not done .
i don &apos;t need to know that bad what you said .
i &apos;m beggin &apos; you to stop . just stop .
no one is aly .
okay ? you have to give other people a chance .
you deserve to be happy , winston .
just go on the date .
or i could fire up another episode
and we could see where they hide the tee @-@ tee wah wah this time .
i wonder where it would be .
no , i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m gonna go on the date .
yeah , i think i &apos;ll do that . you guys are right .
could you tell your future husband
to let me out of this room , please ?
i love that man , but he is not letting anyone out of this room .
just being in here makes you fully contaminated .
uh , hey , i was hoping you could put in a good word for me .
i know you &apos;re mad ...
no , i &apos;m not mad , jess .
i &apos;m just , you know , bummed that you &apos;re at my house .
obviously , i know i messed up our relationship
and you probably think i &apos;m a bad person ,
but if you could ...
jess !
what are you doing here ?
at my lover &apos;s house ?
um , were you ...
making love ?
just finished .
he defused me like a bomb .
that sounds nice .
um ... did you bake ...
sam brownies ?
no . chocolate &apos;s way too sexual .
this is just good , old @-@ fashioned kansas cornbread .
jess ...
my gut is telling me
this isn &apos;t going to work out .
please give me a chance to make this right .
five minutes .
okay , good morning .
yes , help yourself to a bagel .
they &apos;re all the same , jan.
no need to put your hands on every one of them .
okay , ladies and gentlemen ,
as you know ,
on the seventh day , god ... he rested .
yes , that &apos;s right .
god rested on the seventh day .
but the question remains :
what did he rest on ?
that &apos;s right .
he rested ... on a chair .
look underneath your butts .
you will find mankind &apos;s greatest invention .
without chairs , do you know what we have ?
squat , both position and diddly kind .
sam , you got rid of your sofa .
boy , that thing really gave me a rash .
five minutes , jess .
okay , look .
i know it &apos;s weird to hire your boyfriend &apos;s ex @-@ girlfriend ,
but i think it &apos;s another way
in which we are linked .
you are the best candidate we &apos;ve had in a long time .
thank you .
as we all know ,
healing is talking .
samuel , what do you think ?
i would love to explore all of this with you ,
but i have a circumcision to perform .
hopefully not your own .
just kidding . i know you &apos;re circumcised .
ha , ha . yeah .
well , not that i think about it , it just ...
i mean , i &apos;m definitely not picturing it right now .
i am picturing it .
only &apos; cause we talked about it .
how long did you two share your journeys ?
couple months .
but at first it was just sex .
i used sex as a wall around my heart .
mmm . uh , jess climbed that wall many , many times .
mmm . uh , couldn &apos;t stop climbing it .
i think i was not the only climber to climb that wall .
until we decided to become a one @-@ wall ,
one @-@ climber mountain .
and then you invited another climber
to lick your toehold .
my roommate , nick , kissed me .
i &apos;m so sorry , sam .
i exist only in the present .
all of that &apos;s behind me .
what ... what about this nick ?
is he sorry ?
i think nick &apos;s kind of still upset
that sam punched him in the throat .
what ?
sam ...
so tender and delicate ...
you haven &apos;t met nick .
he &apos;s just the most throat @-@ punchable boy
in all the world .
i don &apos;t care . i don &apos;t even ...
nick is a whatever , i don &apos;t even have to ...
sam , do you need this nick to apologize for wounding you ?
i do .
so , nick ...
i &apos;m wondering if you could
come in the other room with me
and just , like , real quick ,
apologize to sam for kissing me ?
no .
jess , i told you to leave it alone .
i didn &apos;t , though .
i made it worse .
now the only way i &apos;m gonna get that job
is if nick apologizes to sam .
jess , he hit me . he &apos;s gonna hit me again .
he &apos;s not gonna hit you .
please , it &apos;s my dream job .
i &apos;d like to apologize , nick ,
for punching you in the throat .
i know it hurt a whole lot .
not that much , but you did it , so ...
okay .
and i feel like you should apologize to me
for kissing my girlfriend .
yes , uh , right .
cool .
well , that went so well .
i @-@ i don &apos;t really feel like that was a genuine apology ,
and @-@ and i &apos;d really like one .
yeah , i mean ... did you feel like it was genuine ?
no . actually , he didn &apos;t even apologize .
cool beard , sam .
what &apos;d you just say about my beard , bro ?
bro ?
yeah , i just said &quot; cool beard . &quot;
i think your beard looks really cool .
talk about my beard one more time , bro .
sam , &quot; bro &quot; is a beach term .
the beard is very fun .
say &quot; beard . &quot;
you want me to say the word
that starts with a &quot; b , &quot;
ends with a &quot; d &quot; ?
yeah .
say &quot; beard &quot; one more time , bro .
say the word &quot; beard , &quot; bro !
beard .
nick , are you dying ?
&apos;cause it looks like you &apos;re dying !
not dying .
who are you ?
i don &apos;t know what it is .
i just can &apos;t help it with this guy .
why didn &apos;t you just hit me in the nads like a normal person , sam ?
well , i &apos;m leaving .
wait , wait , wait , wait , wait ! don &apos;t , don &apos;t go !
nobody goes .
jim morrison .
that &apos;s who you look like .
we are solving this conflict
in the mother @-@ loving feelings farm .
those sunglasses are amazing .
well , they &apos;re made even more amazing
by your reflection in them .
wait , how are you seeing my reflection in them ?
you got me . i &apos;m not .
i &apos;m just running game .
are you this smooth @-@ talking in regular glasses ?
no , i &apos;m not that smooth @-@ talking , no .
i &apos;m not . i &apos;m not gonna lie to you .
honesty ,
i stole coffee from a bagel restaurant .
um , i didn &apos;t know how the line worked .
okay , now i &apos;ve talked .
uh , who wants to go next-- sam ?
sure , uh , honesty ,
i honestly want nick to apologize for kissing jess .
i did apologize , sam .
real , real quick-- you have to address honesty directly .
you want me to talk to a chair ?
i don &apos;t want to .
hey , you like soup ?
right ? you like soup , right ?
of course i like soup .
all right , well , address the chair
and i &apos;ll make you some soup .
no strings attached .
well , except for the string of the chair .
all right .
honesty ,
i &apos;m , uh , sorry i ki ...
you know what ? i &apos;m not .
i &apos;m not sorry that i kissed your girlfriend .
&apos;cause , first of all ,
she wanted me to !
and it was fun .
it felt great .
and then we dated for a long time
and that was fun .
you were out of the picture , not even in her thoughts .
it was a whole new thing . we just , we fell in love
with each other , like crazy love-- like ,
a lot of good memories , a lot of passion .
a lot of good sex .
nick .
we once tried to sneak into the kids &apos; choice awards ,
and we got in and watched a bunch of kids get awards .
so , yeah .
nick . topped ...
okay . i have a fever of 103
and i &apos;m talking to a chair and i &apos;m not a great talk ...
o @-@ okay .
cool , cool . well , i think everything &apos;s good then .
sam , i can feel you holding back .
if you can &apos;t be honest now
in this strange place to that hideous chair ,
how can i trust you with my mind ,
my breasts
and my precious yoni .
sounds like it &apos;s full of yarn .
okay , fine . honesty , all right ,
i ... had a really hard time
opening up to someone and then i met jess and ...
and i thought we were ...
we were great together .
and then nick kissed her ,
and i @-@ i went down kind of a weird path .
i gained 85 pounds .
and then i lost , like , 100 .
i had no idea .
poured almost all my money into silkworms .
they froze to death .
now i &apos;m doing yoga , meditation ,
and ... i &apos;m a vegan
and i don &apos;t know .
what the hell have i become ?
look at these shoes , huh ?
look at these ridiculous shoes !
i like those shoes .
they &apos;re made from recycled shoes .
they are so dumb !
i don &apos;t know who i am !
i want to go back to who i was !
there he is .
the real sam .
what a breakthrough ! sam .
it is an honor to meet you .
i &apos;m genevieve .
and i am also dumping you .
okay , that &apos;s great .
that &apos;s perfect , yeah .
as usual , i have had a terrible time
in your horrible loft
with all of you idiot people .
sam , wait !
if you take your bike , will you relock mine ?
thank you .
oh , genevieve , i am so sorry .
don &apos;t be , don &apos;t be .
i wanted a resolution
and i got one .
now , if you &apos;ll excuse me ,
i &apos;m going to call my childhood phone number
and scream at whoever picks up .
i &apos;ll see you monday .
wait , i got the job ?
of course you did .
this was one of the most profound
feelings farm i have ever been a part of .
radical , jess , radical .
uh , yeah , i have questions about where to park and stuff ,
but you know , i &apos;ll just , uh , i &apos;ll text you !
what if the big letter comes back ?
i can &apos;t believe it just took a high fever
for me to like this show .
not if it &apos;s silent !
well , i hate it .
why is the crispy castle
bigger than mount tummy tum ?
it &apos;s dang gibberish .
how was your presentation ?
well , thank you for asking .
it was a disaster .
we can expect robust grow ...
are you holding in a sneeze ?
god , where did it even go ?
son of a bitch .
how did i get sick ?
i was so careful .
you did the best you could .
i have no idea , man .
we &apos;re missing poppycock .
you guys , i hate that sam &apos;s out there mad at me .
because he &apos;s mad at you
or because you still have feelings for him ?
because he &apos;s mad at me . if i could just--
leave it alone . leave it alone , jess .
right . you &apos;re right .
wow , you shaved .
i mean , not &quot; wow &quot; like i like it .
i mean ... i don &apos;t not like it .
what are you doing here ? i , i don &apos;t want your cornbread .
it &apos;s not cornbread . it &apos;s , uh ,
it &apos;s brownies .
hey , i &apos;m sorry we broke up .
and i think for me it was just ...
weird timing .
but i agree with you .
we were ...
great together .
really great .
get out of my life .
big shift in tone there .
eh , nick &apos;ll eat &apos; em .
