good morning , leonard .
yeah. we &apos;re gonna
have to stop by pottery barn on the way to work .
i bought these star wars sheets ,
but they turned out to be much too stimulating
to be compatible with a good night &apos;s sleep .
i don &apos;t like the way darth vader stares at me .
i &apos;m not going to work .
oh , just because your career &apos;s been stagnant
for a few years , that &apos;s no reason to give up .
sheldon , i was up all night
using the new free @-@ electron laser
for x @-@ ray diffraction experiment .
did the laser accidentally burn out your retinas ?
no .
then you can drive. let &apos;s go .
didn &apos;t i tell you i &apos;d be working nights
and that you &apos;d have to make other arrangements ?
you did .
and ?
i didn &apos;t .
let &apos;s go .
good night , sheldon .
but how am i going to get to work ?
take the bus .
i can &apos;t take the bus anymore .
they don &apos;t have seat belts , and they won &apos;t let you
latch yourself to the seat with bungee cords .
you tried to latch yourself to the seat with bungee cords ?
i didn &apos;t try . i succeeded .
but for some reason , it alarmed the other passengers
and i was asked to de @-@ bus .
oh , you &apos;re a big boy .
you &apos;ll figure it out .
don &apos;t talk to me like i &apos;m a child .
now , take me to return my star wars sheets !
penny ?
penny ? penny ?
sheldon. what is it ?
leonard &apos;s asleep .
thanks for the update .
no. wait .
you have to drive me to work .
yeah , i really don &apos;t think i do .
but i don &apos;t drive , and i can &apos;t take the bus .
honey , you &apos;ll be fe as long as you don &apos;t do
that bungee cord thing , okay ?
penny .
didn &apos;t you recently stated that you and i are friends ?
yes , sheldon. we are friends .
then i hereby invoke what i &apos;m given to understand
is an integral part of the implied covenant of friendship .
the favor .
oh , dear god .
i &apos;m sorry , i didn &apos;t realize
i was interrupting your morning prayers .
when you &apos;re done , we &apos;ll go .
thank you for driving me to work .
you know this is my day off , sheldon .
oh , good . i &apos;m not keeping you from anything .
your &quot; check engine &quot; light is on .
typically that &apos;s an indicator
to , you know , check your engine .
it &apos;s fine. it &apos;s been on for , like , a month .
well , actually , that would be all the more reason to ...
you know , check your engine .
sheldon , it &apos;s fine .
if it were fine ,
the light wouldn &apos;t be on .
that &apos;s why the manufacturer installed that light ,
to let you know it &apos;s not fine .
maybe the light &apos;s broken .
is there a &quot; check the &apos; check engine light &apos; light &quot; ?
what ?
studies have shown that performing tasks
such as eating , talking on a cell phone
or drinking coffee while driving
reduces one &apos;s reaction time
by the same factor as an ounce of alcohol .
do you have any alcohol ?
of course not .
too bad .
you &apos;re going up euclid avenue ?
leonard takes los robles avenu
well , good for leonard .
euclid avenue is shorter as the crow flies ,
but it has speed bumps , which appreciably increase
point @-@ to @-@ point drive time ,
making it the less efficient choice .
but you have the conn .
of course , if you &apos;re not going to slow down
for the speed bumps ,
i withdraw my previous objection .
here &apos;s a fun question .
do you know what the most common street name is ?
no .
the answer &apos;s tricky .
it &apos;s second street .
you see , you &apos;d think it would be first street ,
but in most towns , first street eventually
gets renamed to something else .
you know , like main street ,
broad street .
michigan avenue .
see , leonard and i often use our commute time
to exercise our minds with brain @-@ teasers like that .
we also play games .
would you like to play one ?
no .
oh , come on. it &apos;s fun .
ooh ! another bump .
okay . i &apos;ll say an element , and , and you say an element
whose name starts with the last letter
of the one i said , okay ?
i &apos;ll start .
helium .
now , you could say &quot; mercury . &quot;
that would give me a &quot; y . &quot;
ooh. very clever. that &apos;s a tough one .
so i go with &quot; ytterbium , &quot; which gets you back to &quot; m . &quot;
so you go &quot; molybdenum , &quot; and i say &quot; magnesium . &quot;
you say &quot; manganese . &quot; i say &quot; europium , &quot;
and , then , you &apos;re left with &quot; mendelevium , &quot;
and ... there are no more m &apos;s
because i believe that meitnerium
should still be called ekairidium .
so , congratulations. you win .
do you wanna go again ?
why don &apos;t we just have a little quiet time now ?
all right .
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m finding your reckless nonchalance
regarding the check @-@ engine light to be very troubling .
get out .
well , i ve to tell you
that while i do have a theoretical understanding
of the workings of an internal combustion engine ,
i &apos;m not sure i &apos;m capable of performing diagnostics .
i said , &quot; get out . &quot;
okay . i &apos;ll give it a shot .
oh , leonard. there you are .
i &apos;m ready to go home .
t1 i just got here .
good. perfect timing .
sheldon ,
told you , i only have access
to the free @-@ electron laser at night .
i can &apos;t drive you for the next few weeks .
no , you said you couldn &apos;t drive me to work .
this is from work .
howard , help me out here .
no , just for the fun of it , i &apos;m gonna take his side .
now ,
how do you propose i get home ?
how did you get here in the first place ?
penny .
but i sense that &apos;s no longer an option .
look , i need to get edto the laser lab .
you &apos;re just gonna have
to find someone else to take you home .
ah , damn , i picked the wrong side .
oh , god , not euclid avenue !
why did howard leave you
in the middle of the road anyway ?
we had a difference of opinion .
over what ?
whether or not he was trying to kill me .
for the record , i maintain he was .
where are you going ?
i &apos;m taking you home .
oh , but i &apos;m not going home .
it &apos;s wednesday .
wednesday &apos;s new comic book day .
we have to go to the comic book store .
and then , we have to stop
at soup plantation ; it &apos;s creamy tomato soup day .
and radio shack .
there &apos;s a sale on triple @-@ a batteries .
plus , we have to go to pottery barn
and return my star wars sheets .
i have a better idea .
you want to go to pottery barn first ?
can you drive me to pottery barn ?
maybe if i turn off the night @-@ light ,
i can keep the sheets .
good morning .
good morning .
sheldon , sit down .
she &apos;s in my spot .
don &apos;t look at me like that .
everybody knows that my spot .
sheldon , you know that we care about you .
and it &apos;s because we care about you
that we &apos;ve decided we have to speak up .
you &apos;re hurting the people around you , sweetie .
so we made you an appointment ,
and we want you to keep it .
department of motor vehicles new driver handbook ?
but i don &apos;t have a problem .
sheldon , you need to learn how to drive .
this madness has to stop .
penny &apos;s taking you to the dmv .
i &apos;m going to bed .
why penny ?
because rock breaks scissors .
good night .
all right , come on , sheldon .
hold on .
i have one condition .
what ?
we have to stop at pottery barn .
okay .
and radio shack .
fine .
and the comic book store .
all right !
ooh , i want to go to the comic book store .
i like comic books .
i just don &apos;t see why i need a driver &apos;s license .
albert einstein never had a driver &apos;s license .
yeah , but albert einstein didn &apos;t make me wet myself
at 40 miles an hour .
yeah , and i never wanted to kick albert einstein in the nuts .
you know , i gotta ask , why didn &apos;t you just
get a license at 16 like everybody else ?
i was otherwise engaged .
doing what ?
examining perturbative amplitudes
in n = 4 supersymmetric theories
leading to a re @-@ examination of the ultraviolet properties
of multi @-@ loop n = 8 supergravity using modern twistor theory .
well , how &apos; bout when you were 17 ?
take this to the testing area ,
put your name at the top , sign the bottom ,
answer the questions , bring it back. next
application ?
i &apos;m actually more of a theorist .
the application in your hand .
give it to her .
take this to the testing area ,
put your name at the top , sign the bottom ,
answer the questions , bring it back. next !
excuse me , but i have some concerns about these questions .
look at that sign up there .
yes ?
does it say &quot; i give a damn &quot; ?
no .
that &apos;s because i don &apos;t .
just look .
see , this first question makes no sense .
&quot; how many car lengths
should you leave in front of you when driving ? &quot;
there &apos;s no possible way to answer that .
a &quot; car length &quot; is not a standardized unit of measure .
look at the sign .
sheldon , it &apos;s &quot; c . &quot; just put down &quot; c . &quot;
i don &apos;t need yourelp , penny .
listen to that little girl , honey .
put &quot; c . &quot; next !
no , wait ! no , hang on .
look at this next question .
sheldon , why are you arguing with the dmv ?
how else are they going to learn ?
look ...
&quot; when are roadways most slippery ? &quot;
now , okay , there are three answers ,
none of which are correct .
the correct answer is &quot; when covered by
&quot; a film of liquid sufficient to reduce
&quot; the coefficient of static friction
&quot; between the tire and the road to essentially zero ,
but not so deep as to introduce a new source of friction . &quot;
here &apos;s your learner &apos;s permit. go away .
but i &apos;m not done .
i have many additial concerns
about these questions .
don &apos;t make me climb over this counter .
come on. let &apos;s go. come on .
next !
aced it .
okay , that &apos;s it .
let &apos;s boot it up .
booting .
this is a state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art simulator .
i adapted it from something
a friend of mine designed for the army .
is that why i appear to be in downtown fallujah
behind the wheel of an up @-@ armored humvee ?
i haven &apos;t configured it yet .
let &apos;s see ...
bradley tank ...
transport truck ... batmobile ...
ooh ! no .
here we go. red 2006 ford taurus
on the streets of pasadena .
what ?
statistically , red cars are stopped by police
far more often than any other color .
i don &apos;t want any hassles with the fuzz .
fine , what color do you want ?
you know the pale blue of luke skywalker &apos;s lightsaber ?
before it was digitally remastered ?
black , it is .
okay , now , what you want to do first
is turn on the ignition
and shift into drive .
i haven &apos;t fastened my seat belt yet .
okay , fasten your seat belt .
click
now , are there air bags ?
you don &apos;t need air bags .
what if a simulated van rear @-@ ends me ?
i &apos;ll hit you in the face with a pillow .
okay , now shift into drive .
pull out slowly into traffic .
watch out , watch , watch out for the pedestrians !
oh , god .
wait-- slow--
hit the brakes ! the brakes !
thank you .
sorry .
excuse me .
my bad .
student driver .
how did you manage
to get on the second floor of the glendale galleria ?
i don &apos;t know .
i was on the pasadena freeway . i missed my exit ,
flew off the overpass , and one thing led to another .
maybe you want to give it a rest and try again tomorrow .
no . i quit .
aw , the pet store .
remind me to compliment wolowitz on the software .
it &apos;s amazingly detailed .
th so wait , you &apos;re just gonna give up ?
no , i &apos;m not giving up .
i never give up .
so , what is it you &apos;re doing ?
i &apos;m ...
transcending the situation .
i &apos;m clearly too evolved for driving .
what does that mean ?
leonard , have you ever wondered why my little toes
and lateral incisors are significantly smaller
than the average for someone of my size ?
i wonder a lot of things about you , sheldon .
but not @-@ not that .
well , those are indicators
that i &apos;m farther along the evolutionary scale
than the average human .
no kidding .
well , no , no .
i &apos;m not gonna go so far as to say
that i represent a distinct new stage in humankind--
you know , a homo novus , if you will .
no , that &apos;s for anthropologists to decide .
but i am convinced
that the rson i cannot master the plebeian task of driving
is because i &apos;m not meant to .
yes , you are .
you &apos;re meant to learn how to drive .
please learn how to drive !
no , no .
leonard , i &apos;m meant for greater things ,
like unraveling the mysteries of the universe ,
not determining when it &apos;s safe
to pass a stopped school bus on a country road .
it &apos;s never safe .
yeah , well , i know that now .
fine .
assuming that everything you say is true ,
how does the biologically superior homo novus
get to work tomorrow morning ?
homo novus doesn &apos;t know .
well , hang in there .
maybe you &apos;ll evolve into something with wings .
good morning , gentlemen .
hey. good morning .
is there some new kind of casual friday
i don &apos;t know about ?
no , he lives here now .
really ? why ?
since he won &apos;t take the bus and he &apos;s too evolved to drive ,
he decided it would be easier to just sleep in his office
and shower in the radiation lab
until i &apos;m finished with my experiment .
but you finished your experiment a week ago .
yep
ay , dios mio .
tra vez ?
deben ser rata
las ratas no hacen pan tostado
y le cortan las orillas .
ay , dios mio !
