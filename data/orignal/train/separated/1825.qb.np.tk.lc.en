we begin life with few obligations .
good morning , seattle .
welcome to this fine morning full of sunshine--
we pledge allegiance to the flag .
we swear to return our library books .
but as we get older , we take vows ,
we make promises ,
we get burdened by commitments
to do no harm , to tell the truth and nothing but ,
to love and cherish till death do us part .
so we just keep running up a tab
until we owe everything to everybody ,
and suddenly think , what the ...
are you sure it was a bear and not a deer ?
there are a lot of deer in those woods ,
and the bucks can get pretty big .
i think i know the difference between a bear and a deer
rest , ice and elevate , okay ?
you know how--you know how i get the car ?
i had to throw a raw steak and run for my life .
that was a 10 @-@ ounce filet .
i &apos;ve been marinating it for three days .
we have to move !
where ?
we barely make 30 grand a year .
and who knows if we &apos;re even gonna have a job after the merger ?
we could move back to meredith &apos;s .
you did not just say that ?
why not ? !
because we &apos;re married now . this is how it &apos;s supposed to be--
you and me out in the world , making a life for ourselves .
besides , don &apos;t you just enjoy waking up to the fresh air
and the sounds of birds chirping ?
you know what i enjoy ?
i enjoy plumbing . i enjoy plumbing so much !
it &apos;s not that i don &apos;t love it at mer &apos;s . i do .
it &apos;s just ... i just-- i can &apos;t move backwards , alex .
not after everything that &apos;s ...
i just need to keep moving forward .
okay ?
thank you .
i know it hasn &apos;t exactly been easy around here the past few weeks .
and i know you want answers .
but i &apos;m afraid i don &apos;t have them ,
not just yet ...
he brought us down
here to make himself feel good .
well , at least he sprung for good danish .
you know how many nurses got fired for the danish ?
the mercy west staff will be arriving in three days ,
and when they do ,
there will be more cutbacks and more layoffs .
and i need each and every one of you
to step up and be leaders .
and when i can answer your questions , i will .
if you would like to make an appointment
to talk about your concerns , we can do that
what about my burn center ?
you were right . excellent danish .
anything ?
nope .
there was a papillary muscle rupture in the ccu ,
but the guy died before they could get him into the or
crap . i need surgeries , and i need them now .
i mean , i barely had a hundred hours in the or this month .
and you know they &apos;re gonna keep the residents
with the most hours .
what do you got ?
um , diabetic ulcer .
down to the bone ?
i &apos;m done .
finished . expired meat .
you &apos;re freaking out a little bit .
well , you haven &apos;t been kicked off of two services in one month .
i couldn &apos;t get into an or
if i was bleeding half to death .
you got anything good ?
i &apos;m scrubbing in on an optic glioma later on with derek .
i &apos;ve never seen one .
what are you doing ?
just making sure everything is running smoothly here .
and ... it is .
kudos .
oh , no , no , no . unh . no . i am on hunt &apos;s service .
anything that turns surgical down here is mine .
you don &apos;t need the hour .
you just spent the last six months in the or
unconscious on a table does not count .
meredith .
hey , his neighbor said that he wasn &apos;t getting his mail .
mer- meredith , oh , i heard you got ...
you got married on a sticker .
that &apos;s great .
you know , we should go
so you can have family time .
no , no , no .
i don &apos;t know what &apos;s wrong with him .
did you pick him up off the floor of a bar , lexie ?
that might be a clue .
meredith , no , i &apos;m not ...
i haven &apos;t been drinking . i swear .
now that could be surgical .
okay , make sure his fluids are running wide open .
let &apos;s get that blood hung .
got ffp here .
what-- what about factor vii ?
did you check his inr ?
okay , hang 50 mics of octreotide .
got it .
dr. bailey ,
shouldn &apos;t we check for renal failure ?
move . i need to lavage him .
no , i need to put this up .
okay , hey , pause . there &apos;s way too many people here .
karev , get the orogastric tube in. the rest of you , out .
no , wait a minute . i &apos;m in emergency !
but i was here first .
this is emergent .
he made amends . he &apos;s not drunk .
all right , irving , i &apos;m taking off the growth .
let me know if you feel any pain .
he gets so many of these .
we should have the nursing home
examine him when they bathe him .
i bathe myself .
of course you do , irving . he could fall in the tub .
why don &apos;t you two go get me a cup of coffee ?
you already had a cup , dad .
too much isn &apos;t good for your ticker .
well , he can have decaf , tommy .
we &apos;ll go get you a nice cup of decaf .
thank you , sweetie .
you know , i &apos;m not demented . i &apos;m just old .
all right , uh , mr. waller . all done .
all done .
there might be a little redness ,
but it should heal up nicely .
got it ?
i &apos;ve had these skin things for 30 years . i &apos;m not worried .
what i &apos;m really here for is an a @-@ m @-@ s 700 .
the , uh , penile implant ?
yeah .
well , usually the first step
in treating erectile dysfunction &apos;s drug therapy .
i can , uh ,
if you &apos;re having symptoms , write you a prescription .
no , no , no , no , no , no , no. i took those pills years ago .
they never even gave me a liftoff .
and then my wife died , and i gave up .
but ... i &apos;m seeing this new gal from the east wing .
uh , she &apos;s a younger woman , and ...
i don &apos;t want to disappoint .
i understand .
but it is a surgical procedure ,
so ... there is a question of safety , given your age .
my age .
it &apos;s always my age .
ah . the golden years .
let me tell you about the golden years , doc .
there &apos;s just gotta be more to life than eating pudding and watching &quot; csi . &quot;
now come on .
can you give an old man a working johnson ?
did i tell you how great your hair looks ?
it &apos;s all just short and , um , edgy .
wow , you are really tweaking out .
how long has it been since you &apos;ve cut ?
over a week
stevens ,
i have something for you if you &apos;re interested .
well , i &apos;m interested .
uh , an m.v.c. came in a while back .
during his workup , i found an abdominal sarcoma .
since then , i &apos;ve been following his recurrences ,
and , uh , he came back today with his third one .
wondered if you could scrub in if you feel ready .
i &apos;m ready .
i &apos;m ready .
he is in pr @-@ op .
you know i need a surgery .
and you know i don &apos;t play favorites .
people have been afraid to work with stevens .
it &apos;s like she &apos;s gonna break or something . it &apos;s not right .
she is a good surgeon and she has a way with patients .
and a light touch .
you want nice ?
i can be nice to a dying husk .
yeah . n @-@ not a light touch .
my dad &apos;s dead . at first i thought he was drunk ,
then he started puking blood .
and puking blood and disorientation . usually means ...
end stage liver failure .
which means he &apos;s probably dead by now
or he needs a transplant , and i hope he &apos;s not a candidate ,
because that means he &apos;d be in the hospital for months .
uh , mer .
he needs a transplant , doesn &apos;t he ?
yeah .
you &apos; got end @-@ stage cirrhosis .
we can treat the symptoms , but the only thing
that can save your life is a transplant .
how did it happened so fast
he bathed it in gin .
alex. no , your friend &apos;s right .
except for the gin. i was a scotch man .
what &apos;s-- what &apos;s the next step here ?
do i get on a list ?
um , thatcher , the transplant board has a rule here .
an alcoholic has to be sober at least a year
before he qualifies for a donor liver .
i &apos;m only 90 days .
i &apos;ll do it .
i &apos;ll do it today. i &apos;ll-- i &apos;ll go get tested right now .
lexie-- no , they just take a piece .
my liver willmajor surger
i can &apos;t ask you to do something like that .
it &apos;s ... it &apos;s major surgery .
you &apos;re not asking .
you &apos;re my dad .
you want a kidney ? i &apos;ll throw in one of those , too .
one more time. you be the chief .
you &apos;re all cranky and , uh , in a bad mood .
and i &apos;ll be callie asking for her job back .
you are callie .
right. so it works. you said that yesterday ,
and the day before that
and the day before and before that . so are you gonna do this ?
hey , it is not easy to ask for your job back
after you told your boss to go screw himself
in front of his entire hospital .
it &apos;s humiliating .
so you &apos;re not gonna do it .
what--what is the point ? he already fired me once .
he &apos;s not gonna hire me back now just because of the merger .
whatever. maybe being a surgeon &apos;s overrated .
i &apos;d be happy doing lots of things .
i could open a daycare. babies are cute .
ew. that one just spit .
i don &apos;t want you move to cleveland to be a surgeon
okay , i &apos;m gonna do it .
later ? but i @-@ i will come back later .
my girlfriend &apos;s moving to cleveland .
look at you. coming in on your day off .
trying to get in to the o.r. ?
yeah. i &apos;m gonna give my dad a piece of my liver .
end @-@ stage liver disease. he needs my liver .
i &apos;m giving him some .
go ahead ,
whoa , wait a mins
what is your problem ?
my problem is , you don &apos;t need to jumping
to something like this without thinking about it .
take a couple days. we &apos;ll--we &apos;ll talk .
what is there t on something
it &apos;s major , life @-@ threatening surgery .
okay , my dad needs the transplant
i get that , but what you need to understand--
no , i don &apos;t think u get it at all
you know what i don &apos;t get ?
we &apos;re together. we live together .
we need to decide these things together .
you can &apos;t just go under the knife and leave me a note .
i would i &apos;ll page you
i &apos;m your boyfriend , grey .
he &apos;s my dad .
okay. a little pinch .
oh. i cannot get this stupid thing to work .
try knocking it on something .
insider trick .
what other tricks you know ?
well , stay away from the lime jell @-@ o .
and if you want the good meds , tell &apos; em you have a headache ,
not a stomachache .
oh , and if your arm starts to hurt from all ths nail put
tell &apos; em you want that anesthetic cream. it numbs it .
you &apos;ve done this before .
stage iv melanoma .
um , mrs . helsby ,
i &apos;m gonna have to give him a rectal exam .
so you may want to leave the room for this
oh , no. i &apos;m not his wife
what &apos;s that saying-- uh , they won &apos;t buy the cow
if you give them the milk for free ?
yeah , we &apos;re working on eight years of free milk .
hey , i was gonna propose last year , but i got distracted
by this little thing called cancer .
you got the best excuse in the book
nice .
the ring &apos;s at home in the mouth guard container ,
all right ?
i &apos;m just waiting for the right moment .
what we &apos;d do is we &apos;d surgically place
the silicone implant into the penis ,
and when the pump is squeezed before intercourse--
where does the pump go ? in the scrotum .
so to pump it up , i just squeeze the jewels ?
dad. dad. it &apos;s--it &apos;s--it &apos;s ridiculous .
you &apos;re 82 years old .
so ? i shouldn &apos;t have a sex life ?
go on , doc. you &apos;re just getting to the good part .
no , no , listen to me. this is major surgery .
they have to cut your ...
they cut you open , dad. you could bleed or ...
you want to die , huh , over an erection ?
wars have been fought over an erection , son .
irving , i &apos;m--i &apos;m sure that a @-@ a thing like this
isn &apos;t covered by medicare .
and i know you don &apos;t want to use your savings ,
&apos;cause you &apos;re gonna want to help janey pay for college .
sweetheart , i love janey .
but let &apos;s stop pretending she &apos;s going to college .
she &apos;s pretty ,
but she &apos;s not too sharp .
dad .
tom , this is my money .
this is the way i want to spend it .
your mother and i saved our entire lives
for what she called &quot; a rainy day . &quot;
and then she died before we could spend one cent .
i think your mother would be proud
that i &apos;m finally doing something nice for myself .
you think mom would be proud of geting a penis pump
we &apos;re gonna have to run some tests .
we might not even know if the surgery is an option .
so why don &apos;t we all just calm down ,
start from there ?
hey , what you lookin &apos; for ?
excuse me ?
oh , i @-@ i couldn &apos;t help but notice , uh ,
you have no resident on your decompressive laminectomy .
well , today &apos;s your lucky day , &apos; cause i &apos;m available .
yang , right ? mm @-@ hmm .
i @-@ i heard you were hard @-@ core into cardio .
i can be hard @-@ core into anything you want .
are you whoring yourself out for surgeries ?
oh , shut up. you forced me into it .
biology--it &apos;s crap , utter crap .
d.n.a. , r.n.a.--doesn &apos;t make someone your family .
it does , actually .
he needs a liver transplant .
lexie volunteered like she just got asked for a $ 1 bill .
i left the room. he &apos;s not my father .
wait , your dad need transplant ?
ooh. maybe not. maybe he &apos;s dead this time .
ah , damn it .
it &apos;s worse than i thought .
the scarring &apos;s completely fused his organs together .
god , it looks like
somebody poured a bottle of glue down there .
how do we fix it ?
we don &apos;t .
if we could just to the cancer ,
i think we could get clean margins .
with this many adhesions ,
the risk of tumor rupture-- it &apos;s too high .
we cut into him again , we &apos;re doing more harm than good .
but maybe if we just--
we have to know when to say when , stevens .
and i &apos;m saying when .
is he dead ?
no .
we rushed dr. grey &apos;s labs. she wasn &apos;t a match .
oh. okay .
um ... what about holly ?
you , uh , you-- molly , our sister ?
yeah .
she lives on an army base with her husband in bahrain .
um , plus , she has a history of d.v.t. ,
so she can &apos;t be a donor. oh .
meredith , we didn &apos;t call you here to ...
w @-@ we thought you should know
before we go in and tell him , just in case .
right. right. no , thank you for keeping me in the loop .
thank you. i , um , have to go prep for my surgery now .
okay .
why are we eating lunch
in a room full of diseased organs ?
we are hiding from lexie
and her big , sad &quot; i love my daddy &quot; eyes ,
because i can &apos;t take it anymore .
wait , is little grey not a match ?
oh , damn. there goes my transplant .
nice try. it was my transplant .
are you gonna get tested , mer ? .
no. i barely know the guy .
you might as well just get tested .
you could regret it if you don &apos;t do it .
he might be a drunk dad .
but he gave you the ultimate gift .
yeah , the gift of life .
you guys are sick. you really are. you &apos;re sick .
don &apos;t listen to them , mer .
they just want a surgery .
mama needs a cut
babe , you got some dirt on your neck. right there .
that &apos;s not dirt. that &apos;s a tick. ew .
get it--get it off me .
is that a tick ?
it is a tick .
it &apos;s a tick .
look at it. it &apos;s all swollen .
get it off me now , please .
it &apos;s having lunch , too .
get it off me !
get it off
get it ! get it ! somebody , take it off !
you know , the kids think this is all vanity .
but i really need this surgery , doc .
well , if she loves you ,
she &apos;ll understand if you can &apos;t ... perform .
cuddling &apos;s nice , too .
you know , you &apos;re just a kid , doc .
you won &apos;t understand .
but one day , you &apos;re gonna wake up
and all the big stuff ,
all the milestones you &apos;ve been looking forward to--
graduation , wedding , having kids , your grandkids--
it &apos;s all behind you .
it &apos;s all over .
all you got is a bunch of yesterdays
and very few tomorrows .
i haven &apos;t wanted to make love with a woman
since sylvie died over 20 years ago .
and then one night ...
one night ...
they sat me down at the bingo table with marion .
and you just knew .
she &apos;s my tomorrow .
he &apos;s still sleeping .
good. he needs his rest .
dr. bailey , i , um , i @-@ i was wondering if--
if you could lie ,
if--if you could lie to the transplant board
and--and tell them that he &apos;s been sober for a year .
um , they trust you. they &apos;ll listen to you .
and--and maybe then he could-- he could get on the list .
dr. grey , i have 15 other patients
all waiting for liver transplants--
15 people in an untenable situation ,
none of whom drank themselves into it .
so , no , i will not lie ,
not for you , not for anyone .
do you have any other questions i can answer ?
how would you like it
things crawling all over you ,
stupid squirrels having a party all night on your roof ?
i mean , what the hell are they doing up there anyway ?
applying betadine to the area .
i don &apos;t know how to deal with this . i don &apos;t camp
my parents were lounge lizards .
i was raised in a bar .
extracting the arachnid .
and then there &apos;s no plumbing. i mean , the--the toilet ?
it empties into a bucket underneath the trailer .
a crap bucket !
and izzie &apos;s all , &quot; marriage is an adventure ,
just the two of us , exploring the wild . &quot;
i married freakin &apos; lewis and clark .
well , i guess i &apos;m done .
that &apos;s it . i mean , i &apos;m--i &apos;m telling her ,
we &apos;re moving back to meredith &apos;s
i &apos;m done .
you can &apos;t do that .
why not ?
because that &apos;s not how it works .
i mean , she &apos;s just been through hell .
she &apos;s not okay yet .
just give her one , alex .
since when did you become a marriage counselor ?
i guess when you save someone &apos;s life ,
you kinda want it not to suck .
you know , i hate when people who don &apos;t live here
say that seattle weather sucks. those people suck .
ooh. i wanted to show you something. i made a list .
hmm. you made a list ?
yeah , to read to the chief .
50 reasons why you should hire me as an attending .
okay , number one ,
i built a man &apos;s bones out of titanium rods .
two , what i lack in experience , i make up for in raw talent .
three , i can go seven hours in the o.r.
without even taking a pee break .
four ... what are you doing ?
i &apos;m going back to the hospital .
uh , this is important .
i lost my favorite scrub nurse yesterday .
anne-- she &apos;s a single mother .
she &apos;s supporting three kids , and now she &apos;s out of a job .
and this morning , a 10 month old hemorrhaged
while i was deep in her chest ,
and i didn &apos;t have my favorite scrub nurse .
i had to actually look up and ask for a mesh wrap
because the new nurse didn &apos;t know me .
anne knew all my moves before i even made &apos; em .
and it felt terrible to be in the o.r. without her .
i was really looking forward
to spending 30 minutes in the park with my girlfriend .
&apos;cause this merger thing ? it &apos;s important to all of us .
sorry. i &apos;ve been ... just ...
sorry .
he &apos;ll say yes or he &apos;ll say no .
and then we &apos;ll know .
okay .
this our optic glioma guy ?
mm @-@ hmm. are you sure you &apos;re up for this ?
there &apos;ll be others. i promise .
yeah , you know ,
everyone is looking at me like i owe him something ,
but he &apos;s still the bad guy here .
you don &apos;t owe him anything .
i ...
so i &apos;m gonna be fired .
i &apos;ve done a lot of really dumb things today ,
including pulling your medical files .
lexie--
just listen. i didn &apos;t want to do this .
i didn &apos;t want to have to come to you
for anything , ever .
so i thought if i looked up your blood type
and it was the wrong one , then that would be it ,
then i could just stop thinking about it .
but i can &apos;t ,
because you have his blood .
and i know that he &apos;s not your dad .
i know that he was never there for you .
and i &apos;m--i would never ask you to give him anything .
he doesn &apos;t deserve a thing from you. he doesn &apos;t .
but he &apos;s ...
he &apos;s gonna die , meredith .
and so i &apos;m asking you
to give something to me .
i &apos;m asking ...
i am asking you to give me my dad .
because as crappy as he was to you ,
oh , he was wonderful to me .
he never missed a single dance recital .
he was there at my fifth grade graduation ,
and what is that ? that &apos;s not even real .
i know he &apos;s not your dad .
i @-@ i know that .
but somehow ...
you have his blood , and i don &apos;t .
so i &apos;m asking you ...
give me my dad .
hi , meredith .
we found a match .
what ?
we found a match , a donor liver .
so we &apos;re gonna schedule the surgery for tonight .
uh , that &apos;s terrific .
i ... but i thought i-- i wasn &apos;t eligible for the ...
the transplant list .
it &apos;s not from the list. it &apos;s me .
i got tested ,
and my crossmatch was negative ,
which means we &apos;re an ideal match .
so i &apos;m gonna go get admitted , and we &apos;ll do this .
mer .
i &apos;m a drunk , meredith .
i did this .
i put myself in this bed .
i broke me .
i can &apos;t .
i won &apos;t let you put me back together .
i &apos;ve put you through enough .
it &apos;s a generous offer .
i can &apos;t .
i can &apos;t accept it .
i &apos;m sorry ,
but there &apos;s gotta be something else you can do .
he &apos;s 31. we just bought a condo together .
we just rescued a puppy .
ange , ange , it &apos;s gonna be okay .
no , it &apos;s not .
there just sending you home to ...
what kind of doctors are you ?
you &apos;re supposed to do something .
they &apos;re doing everything they can .
all right , look ,
dr. hunt &apos;s given us extra time ,
time that we never would &apos;ve had--
dr. hunt , can i s--
excuse me .
we could try cytoreductive surgery .
it won &apos;t work . we have to be able to remove the entire tumor .
with these kind of adhesions , you can &apos;t do that .
okay , then what about ball @-@ tipped electrosurgery ?
it could help us get around the adhesions .
his cancer is incurable
that man through another excruciatingly painful surgery
when he &apos;s got a survival rate of 13 % .
i had 5 % .
stevens
i had a 5 % chance of survival .
i have incurable cancer , but i am living with it .
and the only reason i am , the only reason
i &apos;m standing here right now is
because no one ever said to me
&quot; we &apos;ve done everything we can do . &quot;
i &apos;m alive right now because people fought for me .
cristina fought for me .
he deserves the chance to fight .
if he doesn &apos;t want it , fine . i will shut up .
but he deserves a chance .
you know what ? i &apos;m good . i &apos;m off the hook .
i did what i was supposed to do .
i offered . mother teresa would be proud .
you gotta go back in there .
and do what , cry and call him &quot; daddy &quot; ?
he &apos;s the sick one , okay ?
he &apos;s sick and you &apos;re not. you gotta go back in there .
just say what you gotta say and
make him take it .
i tried .
try again .
his b.p. is normal .
his blood work is pristine .
he , uh , appears to have the heart of a 50 year old .
so what does that mean ?
that means he &apos;s clear for surgery .
and you &apos;re really gonna go through with this , dad ?
you bet i am , champ .
well , it &apos;s your money . we can &apos;t stop you .
but irving and i have talked it over .
we &apos;ve decided if you do this ,
we &apos;re taking you out of the home ,
moving you back in with us .
i don &apos;t want to move in with you .
i &apos;m happy where i am .
no , that place
is causing you to make irrational decisions .
you &apos;re going after a younger woman ,
sneaking into her room at night .
it &apos;s not appropriate for a man your age .
there &apos;s an extra twin in janey &apos;s room ,
and she &apos;ll be thrilled
to spend more time with her grandpa .
come on . it &apos;s just an erection .
excuse me ?
all the guy wants is a woody .
god forbid you get to be his age ,
and your kids won &apos;t let you have one .
he &apos;s your father .
he &apos;s taken care of you your entire lives ,
given you everything .
and now he needs something ,
and you want to throw that in his face ?
you know how many people would jump at the chance
to give back to their parents ,
who would sacrifice everything without blinking ...
and there &apos;s nothing wrong with dating a younger woman .
it keeps you young .
and that &apos;s my professional opinion .
does the chief always ...
pay such attention to his patients ,
or just the ones ...
whose wives he had an affair with ?
sorry .
how &apos;d i do this to myself ?
how did i end up here ?
you woke up every morning ...
and you promised yourself
that last night would be your last drink .
and you made it ...
till 9 : 00 a.m.
or noon ...
some days till cocktail hour .
and you were so pleased with yourself
that you rewarded yourself
with a drink .
you convinced yourself again
that it would be the only one .
you have a disease , thatcher .
when you &apos;re in it ,
you can &apos;t stop .
you can &apos;t undo what you did .
but meredith ...
is offering you a second chance , man .
you need that liver .
you need it now ...
if you want to live .
i took her childhood .
i can &apos;t take any more from her .
you ...
you better take care of my girls .
you owe me at least that .
hey . my stromal cancer patient ?
we &apos;re going for the surgery .
we &apos;re gonna do it . hunt actually listened to me .
that &apos;s great .
right ? i &apos;m gonna go scrub in .
oh , hey , are you okay ?
i &apos;m sorry about the whole tick thing .
i &apos;m fine .
ah , it &apos;s--it &apos;s a small price to pay for fresh air .
okay. mm .
you &apos;re welcome .
you &apos;re the guy who used to pour my cereal in the morning .
that &apos;s it . that &apos;s all i remember about you .
you &apos;re not my father .
you &apos;re just the guy who used to pour my cereal .
and if you die ,
it probably won &apos;t change my life that much .
but it will change hers .
if you die , it will break her .
and i &apos;m not gonna let you do that .
i don &apos;t know what it &apos;s like to have a father ,
but i do know what it &apos;s like to have a sister ,
and it &apos;s good .
and if we can get through this ,
the door will be opened for us to ge to know each other
the door is open .
so before intercourse ,
he squeezes the pump in his scrotum .
and his age doesn &apos;t make it higher risk ?
oh , well , i mean this ,
there &apos;s always risk involved , but this is the most
technologically advanced solution to his problem .
what &apos;s high risk ?
does someone have a risky ,
high @-@ tech surgery ?
uh , cristina , i don &apos;t think you want it .
i think this would be a real challenge for dr. yang .
do you think she can handle it ?
oh , i can handle it .
i don &apos;t think she can handle it .
i can handle it .
pre @-@ op &apos;s in 20 @-@ 83 .
thank you , dr. sloan .
i &apos;m gonna pay for that later ,
but it was kinda worth it .
beat it . sloan wants me on this .
okay , mr. waller .
i &apos;m dr. yang .
i &apos;ll be taking over
your pre @-@ operative care this evening
for your penile implant surgery .
you &apos;re getting a penile implant ?
yes , ma &apos;am .
that fella , he was just gonna shave me .
terrific .
but you wanted a surgery .
yeah , putting a bicycle pump in some old man &apos;s junk ...
is not surgery . it &apos;s--it &apos;s-- it &apos;s punishment .
well , at least you don &apos;t have to be laid up in bed
for the next month .
you better tell me all the gossip
about the mercy west people .
i want all the gory details .
yeah , yeah .
am i stupid for doing this ?
no .
really ?
you get to save your dad &apos;s life tonight .
hey . what are you doing here ?
you didn &apos;t think
i was gonna let you do this by yourself , did you ?
unh @-@ unh . this is not how this is going to work .
do i need to find you something to do ?
no . i have a penis .
i &apos;m gonna sit by her head . i won &apos;t say a word .
shepherd , this is my o.r.
i respect that , dr. bailey .
but this is my wife that you &apos;re cutting into .
i ... i haven &apos;t just been waiting
for the right moment to propose .
you &apos;ve been waiting for remission .
yeah . i just didn &apos;t want to saddle her down with a sick husband .
but now it looks like that just might be part of the package .
so ... what the hell ?
i &apos;m not gonna waste another moment .
you shouldn &apos;t .
ready when you are .
you ready ?
i had five interns. four of you have been on this table .
one of you has cancer , one of you died .
you better not pull anything funny on me , grey .
all right , let &apos;s see what we got here .
dr. yang , the , uh , senior resident ,
should test the apparatus .
i &apos;ll understand if you wanna pass .
no , i don &apos;t pass , dr. sloan .
this might be a joke to all of you ,
but i do my job .
squeezing the scrotum .
nice .
awesome .
liver &apos;s here .
make sure you keep the bowel covered .
ah . oh , he &apos;s got some collateral bleeding .
i &apos;m gonna need the argon beamer . hang more f.f.p.
b.p. &apos; s dropping out .
sir , you really can &apos;t kill this guy
i &apos;m aware karev
if it &apos;s bad news , i don &apos;t want to wake her .
wake her .
he had a couple months , and we just took that away .
i &apos;m sorry . it &apos;s my fault .
it &apos;s my fault . it &apos;s my call
i was wrong , and i should &apos;ve known better . i should &apos;ve ...
i should &apos;ve taught better .
but , you know , you see a one in a million ,
and you want to believe . i was wrong to do the surgery .
i was wrong to put you on this case .
you weren &apos;t ready . you weren &apos;t ready to be here .
you beat the odds , stevens . you were that one in a million .
but you cannot be a doctor and a patient in here .
you have to choose .
how &apos;d it go , doc ?
i don &apos;t think you &apos;ll be disappointed .
well , well , well .
dr. sloan ,
i &apos;d ... i &apos;d like you to meet my marion .
hello , sweetheart .
sir .
now is not the time , yang .
i have good hands . they &apos;re fast . they &apos;re dexterous .
they were made to throw ties and do complex procedures .
these hands were made for surgery .
today , they should &apos;ve been deep inside a heart saving a life .
instead they removed a tick and pumped a penis .
what &apos;s your point ?
my point ?
you know what ? you should cut me .
what ?
from the program .
you have to make more cuts , and i should go .
&apos;cause if you can &apos;t give me
a brilliant cardiothoracic attending
who is willing to teach me ,
then i can &apos;t get what i need from this hospital .
everyone is scared of losing their job , and so am i.
but if i can &apos;t learn , if i can &apos;t use my gift ,
then i ...
i @-@ i guess that scares me more .
that &apos;s my point , sir .
the thing about being a surgeon ...
everybody wants a piece of you .
we take one little oath ...
the case where he kept his mouth guard ...
you should open it .
i &apos;m very sorry for your loss .
and suddenly , we &apos;re drowning in obligations ...
to our patients , to our colleagues ,
to medicine itself .
chief .
are ... are you okay ?
i have responsibilities ...
to make this hospital
the best medical facility it could be ...
to repair what i have broken ,
even if it was 20 years ago .
if i am now the bad guy ,
if i am now the villain here ,
well ...
well , so be it .
this must be so hard for you .
thanks , torres .
i w ... i was gonna ...
i was ...
but i &apos;m gonna ... i &apos;m gonna go .
so ... you take care , okay ?
torres .
sir ?
go see h.r. tomorrow .
tell &apos; em you &apos;re an attending surgeon
at seattle grace hospital , and you want a new badge .
and ... take some of these danish home .
they &apos;ll just go to waste .
so we do what any sane person would do .
we run like hell from our promises ,
hoping they &apos;ll be forgotten .
oh , god .
a deer ?
we have to move .
but sooner or later ,
they always catch up .
hey . you &apos;re awake .
h @-@ how--how &apos;s your pain ? is your ... is your mouth dry ?
there &apos;s water . are you thirsty ?
have you been sleeping on me all night ?
yeah . i was ... moving between you and dad ,
who ... who &apos;s doing good .
good . good . that &apos;s good .
and sometimes you find
the obligation you dread the most ...
lexie .
yeah .
you &apos;re on my i.v.
oh , sorry . okay .
