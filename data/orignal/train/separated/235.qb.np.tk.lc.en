you can &apos;t base the rest of your life on one desperate moment .

i have to keep my priorities in order .
we were your priority . what happened , blair ?

together we can make sure it doesn &apos;t .

wakey , wakey , upper east siders , gossip girl here
your one and only source ,
into the scandalous lives of manhattan &apos;s elite .
it seems like today is a big day for everyone ,
but none so much as me .
miss serena , it &apos;s finally here ,
can you believe ? so exciting .
i smile and cry at same time all morning ,
and not even wedding yet .
where &apos;s blair ?
she went to final fitting .
everyone else is coming here , including mr. lonely boy ,
for breakfast buffet .
get dressed and eat something .
you need strength today .
once upon a time , princess b. was a virgin queen ,
and her king was named archibald .
who would &apos;ve thought in just five short years ,
she could turn that headband into a tiara for real ?
i myself have come a long way , too .
but if you think i &apos;ve spent all my recent downtime
reflecting on who i am and what i &apos;ve done in those same five years ,
let me assure you , that couldn &apos;t be further
from the truth .
i was just planning my comeback .
so if i were you ,
i &apos;d watch this space ,
because the new gossip girl is coming .
and what will my first post be ?
all i can say is
you should probably pray i won &apos;t be writing about you .
you &apos;d think i wouldn &apos;t still have to do this sort of thing ,
but labels don &apos;t even have interns anymore .
i &apos;m heading down to the east village
before the wedding to put some of these up .
oh , those are , uh , good luck , by the way .
i wore them at my wedding .
i &apos;m not sure what i &apos;d need luck for ,
as i &apos;m not the one getting married , but thank you .
well , you &apos;re in the wedding party .
that &apos;s close enough . what--
why are you in the wedding party again ?
i did a favor for louis last week , so he asked me .
i figured it &apos;s better than sitting alone in a pew , right ?
oh , so no date tonight , or does the charade continue ?
once blair and louis say &quot; i do , &quot;
then serena and i can say &quot; we don &apos;t &quot; anymore
and go back to being just friends .
no , but at the very least ,
this whole thing is probably a distraction
from every &quot; graduate &quot; thoughts you might have .
well , with blair ? no , any--any thoughts of her
running off with me are-- are long gone .
if anyone &apos;s in danger of pulling a braddock ,
it &apos;s not me . it &apos;s ...
oh , i &apos;m sorry , father .
i don &apos;t play those sort of games anymore .
you &apos;ll need this
to get past security today at the church .
shall we go over the plan again ?
please .
father smythe &apos;s afternoon tea will be supplemented
with sleeping pills instead of his usual sweetener .
when he is unable to perform the ceremony ,
her serene highness will have no choice
but to ask me to step in .
during the service when
i ask if anyone has any objections ,
that &apos;s where you come in .
and tell the world that only last week ,
i &apos;d overheard her tell you she &apos;s still in love with me .
voila . in one fell swoop ,
you &apos;ll have saved blair
from a loveless future ,
and i will have saved monaco
from a thankless princess .
it is , as you people say , a ... win / win .
are you prepared ?
more than you know .
water ?
yes .
oh , serena .
i am so nervous .
can you believe it ? she &apos;s marrying me .
i &apos;m the luckiest man in the world .
don &apos;t worry , miss serena .
you &apos;ll find someone who loves you that way , too .
thank you for indulging on this one more time .
i just wanna make sure i know all the steps .
is everything okay ?
you look ...
surprised that we made it to this day ?
i am .
that your bride @-@ to @-@ be would humiliate our family
in some way .
well ...
you don &apos;t have to worry anymore ,
because the brand @-@ new positive image
of the monegasque royal family is intact .
and blair is transformed into the most advantageous partner .
the press took to her
in the wake of the unfortunate incident .
i couldn &apos;t have hoped for a more perfect arrangement .
i can &apos;t believe you &apos;re talking this way
on the day of my wedding .
my relationship with blair is not a business deal .
but all relationships are business .
sometimes you are lucky ,
you have love as a bonus .
let us hope that you stay lucky .
i can &apos;t stop the feeing that i &apos;ve forgotten something .
i &apos;ve been over everything--
the photographer , the caterer ,
the programs , all fine .
i just cannot put my finger on it .
well , i &apos;m sure it &apos;s all right .
i mean , you never forget anything .
it &apos;s one of your best , uh , and ... worst qualities .
as you know , the mother and father of the bride
will share a dance this evening .
oh , well , the father of the bride is right over there .
oh . well , we &apos;re set then ?
it &apos;s been a long time since we &apos;ve danced .
i &apos;m game if you are ,
as long as you don &apos;t show me up like you did the last time .
serena , uh , louis &apos; best man &apos;s flight
has been delayed from rome .
would you like to just choose another partner
from the present groomsmen just in case ,
or shall i just appoint one for you ?
i &apos;ve got this one covered .
dan humphrey , my hero .
wonderful . thank you .
wow , the dan i knew five years ago
could barely box step ,
and now you &apos;re volunteering to dance ?
well , i &apos;ve gotten much better .
i had to , after i met you .
you wouldn &apos;t have kept a partner with two left feet
around for very long .
well , i liked your left feet .
well , don &apos;t worry . once i put my dress shoes on ,
i &apos;m sure i &apos;ll still step all over you .
hey , she &apos;s here-- the princess bride .
oh , you &apos;re back early .
well , there are several matters to attend to .
uh , first off , cnn is asking if you privately wish
to be called &quot; princess &quot; or &quot; mrs. grimaldi . &quot;
i &apos;m sorry . i just ,
uh , need my best friend for a moment .
go right ahead , mrs. grimaldi .
&quot; mrs. grimaldi &quot; ? what is going on ?
is this happening ?
well , it better be . otherwise ,
all those commemorative plates are for nothing .
oh , god .
i &apos;m gonna be married .
it &apos;s gonna be okay . it &apos;s gonna be more than okay .
it &apos;s gonna be the best day of your life .
are you sure nothing &apos;s gonna ruin it ?
of course not . what could ?
&quot; a true american princess &quot; ? &quot; the next diana &quot; ?
don &apos;t these people do the research anymore ?
maybe they just don &apos;t know her like you do .
or they &apos;ve conveniently forgotten ,
well , i haven &apos;t . that bitch got me remanded to rehab ,
banished from bible camp ,
and abandoned in belarus ,
all for her own enjoyment .
if this is supposed to be her happiest day ,
then i can &apos;t wait to rain all over her parade .
i know you &apos;re capable of many things ,
but how do you expect to get into the wedding of the century ?
by joining forces
with the century &apos;s biggest wedding crasher .
i thought you were getting changed .
i did .
but the surplice ?
oh , no .
i &apos;m sorry . i feel sick .
may i use your restroom ?
no , you may not , but you better find one you can
and stay close to it for the rest of the day .
you may have a touch of food poisoning .
what did you do ?
well , i &apos;m just guessing ...
but it &apos;s possible the water i &apos;ve been continuously pouring
for you all morning came from the tap
at a bass resort bathroom in mexico .
you see , i can &apos;t allow you to destroy blair &apos;s wedding .
you think because i love her ,
i want her all to myself ,
but i &apos;m not that man anymore .
i just want her to be happy .
and if marrying louis will do that for her ,
then that &apos;s what &apos;s going to happen .
i hope you can find a public restroom soon--
one where the line isn &apos;t too long .
bless us , father .
i have a feeling we &apos;re about to sin .
these black market babies got me through my morning sickness .
just don &apos;t take them with vodka .
learned the hard way .
thank you .
now who are you again ?
the answer to your prayers .
from what i overheard , we both wanna take out the same wedding ,
which makes us kindred spirits ,
and now that you &apos;re down for the count ,
i &apos;m more than happy to pick up where you left off .
and why should i trust you ?
because clearly you need an expert .
you were trying to go after blair .
she &apos;s not the weak link .
it &apos;s always the man .
and if you hand me that costume you &apos;re holding ,
i &apos;ll prove it to you .
how can you be so sure you can pull this off ?
jesus owes me one .
isn &apos;t the , uh , reception at the st. regis ?
yeah , i &apos;m clearing the rehearsal breakfast .
isn &apos;t the wedding hours away ?
yeah . i &apos;m waiting on a friend .
he &apos;s inside . he &apos;s a groomsman .
i &apos;m , uh--
nate archibald . yeah .
i worked your office christmas party , remember ?
ow . wow , we must have just missed each other .
the place was so crowded in there , you know ?
you signed my invoice at the end of the night .
well , i was really drunk by the end of the night .
and the day before ,
when we met to create the inventory list .
oh . i &apos;m ... sorry . i meet a lot of people--
it &apos;s okay . you know , i can &apos;t really expect
someone like you to remember someone like me , right ?
if you &apos;ll excuse me ...
who was that ?
someone i should have remembered .
maybe that &apos;s my issue--
paying too much attention to the wrong girls
and not enough to the right ones .
well , if we &apos;re listing your issues ,
i &apos;m not sure i &apos;d start with that one .
i mean , here i am , solo at the wedding
of the girl i spent half my life assuming i &apos;d marry , and why ?
because yet another one of my relationships
turned out to be based on lies .
well , they haven &apos;t all been like that .
yeah , maybe i should just admit that there &apos;s no such thing
as an honest relationship and stop looking .
now that &apos;s crazy . of course there is .
hey , you know the world is really a mess
when the most honest person we know is chuck bass .
how &apos;d that happen ?
well , however it happened ,
that &apos;s what i wanted to talk to you about .
we have to make sure that today is the one day
he &apos;s not planning on honesty .
hey , i was thinking the same thing .
in just three hours , everything is going to change .
well , not that much .
i mean , you were already royalty ,
even if you titled yourself ,
and your kingdom was the steps to a museum ,
but now you have an entire country to rule
because you &apos;re gonna be a real life princess .
how does it feel to have everything you ever wanted ?
you tell me . i saw you with humphrey this morning .
so that fake connection sparked a real one ?
not exactly .
serena van der woodsen ,
you didn &apos;t tell him i said you could stop pretending ?
i just thought , what &apos;s the harm in waiting till the wedding ?
the harm is that you are falling further
while he has little to no clue .
no one is falling anywhere .
i saw how you were looking at him this morning .
back in high school , he always had the same look in his eyes
whenever you would walk by ,
like he was starving , and you were a tasting menu .
oh , please .
just tell him already , before you mess everything up
like you did last year
when you pretended there was a choice to be made .
when even gossip girl knew there wasn &apos;t .
don &apos;t let the fear of how he &apos;s going to respond hold you back .
at the very least , say it out loud and be done with it .
may we come in ?
yes .
i know i said once
that you would never be as pretty as when you &apos;re young ...
but you get prettier every day .
oh , sweetie .
what is it ? what &apos;s-- what &apos;s wrong ?
i don &apos;t know why i &apos;m being like this .
it is just nerves .
yeah .
no , i @-@ i @-@ i ... i can &apos;t breathe .
this dress is cutting off my circulation .
maybe i should just take it off for a minute .
yes , i &apos;ll take it off for a minute .
everything will be okay . get it off !
no , no , sweetie . you just need to breathe .
you just need to breathe .
and--and have a drink of water and get some air .
i &apos;ll get the water .
i &apos;ll open the window .
it &apos;s going to be fine .
come here .
you look so beautiful .
she is a nervous wreck .
well , come on . what bride isn &apos;t on her wedding day ?
i wasn &apos;t .
yes , you were .
the quartet had to stall for 20 minutes
until her xanax kicked in .
i have to run a last minute errand .
could you keep blair comfortable and calm until i get back ?
of course .
sure .
thanks , sweetie .
are you coming ?
no , you &apos;re her father . you should go .
milo ?
with the nanny like you asked .
good . then let &apos;s get cracking .
nathaniel .
didn &apos;t see you this morning .
i slept in .
right . well , uh ... you have any plans today ?
why don &apos;t we do you a favor and skip your ellipses ?
monkey and i have a lovely day planned
far from the upper east side .
the only person you have to worry
about stopping blair &apos;s wedding
is most likely standing right next to you .
hello , humphrey .
chuck .
hey , man , i &apos;m sorry . i just thought i &apos;d , uh , you know ...
i know what you thought , and you don &apos;t need to anymore .
if i &apos;d been meant to stop the wedding ,
there would have been some sort of sign .
i have to go .
mrs. waldorf , what are you--
am i doing here ?
i &apos;ve been asking myself the same question
the whole ride over .
can i have something to drink ?
of course . sparkling or still ?
scotch .
it &apos;s my daughter &apos;s wedding day .
everything should be perfect .
hell , everything is , but that doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s right .
when i married harold , i was so nervous .
i knew something was wrong , but i didn &apos;t know ... what .
but when i married cyrus , i was very calm .
it was like everything was falling into place .
i don &apos;t want my daughter
to have to wait for a second chance to be happy .
she should be happy the first time around .
wh @-@ what are you saying ?
all day long , i &apos;ve had this feeling that i had forgotten something ,
and then i realized what it was .
you .
so ... are you coming to stop this thing or at ?
oh , look at that hat .
look at all of it-- the flowers , the press ,
the people , the sheer enormity of it .
we must not really be married
if this is what a wedding is supposed to be like .
of course we &apos;re married . remember the park ?
darling scott , sonic youth ?
georgina ?
oh , yes , and that . i &apos;m trying to forget that part .
oh , let &apos;s find our seats .
why &apos;d you need this ?
what &apos;s the point of doing something scandalous
if you don &apos;t record it ?
there &apos;s gonna be a scandal ?
after i seduce prince louis and blair catches us ,
there will be .
even if she knows i set this all up just to mess with her ,
once we upload that video to &quot; gossip girl , &quot;
she &apos;ll have to postpone the wedding just to save face ...
and that weird priest will take over from there .
th @-@ there he is . get behind that screen and hit &quot; record . &quot;
come in .
oh . hello .
uh , would you please tell the groom that , um ...
his sister beatrice is waiting in his chambers to see him .
oh , and in ten minutes , tell the bride the same thing .
make that five .
i had it changed so you and serena
can walk down the aisle together .
much more romantic .
oh , right . yeah , sure . thanks .
you don &apos;t have to keep pretending .
blair told me everything .
wh-- what , she did ?
yes , and i &apos;m delighted your feelings have become real .
okay , anyway , uh , thank you both from the bottom of my heart
for covering for blair &apos;s conversion lessons .
you really are her best friends ,
which makes you mine , too .
excuse me.um , apparently ,
my sister made a surprise reappearance .
sure .
prince louis , i had to see you .
oh , i bet you did .
when rufus said he thought he saw you ,
i knew it must be true .
crashing one wedding wasn &apos;t enough for you ?
i didn &apos;t crash . i was invited .
my invitation just got lost in the mail .
i do live in brooklyn now , after all .
i mean , it &apos;s practically the falklands .
well , it &apos;s time for you to go . we &apos;ve already alerted security ,
and i am glad i &apos;m the one to throw you out myself .
now get your clothes on .
we &apos;ll be waiting just outside .
i &apos;m sorry , babe .
oh , we are so not done .
i &apos;ll think of something .
how ? they &apos;re on the other side of that door .
that one , yes , but not that one .
you should , like , totally donate that dress to the smithsonian .
out . out , everybody , out , out .
mother , where have you been ? everyone &apos;s been looking for you .
don &apos;t be angry with me .
angry with you ?
i &apos;ll just leave the two of you alone .
what are you doing here ?
trust me , the last thing i wanted to do
was show up today , but even your own mother
seems to think we need to talk .
well , what i need is for you to--
don &apos;t marry him .
chuck .
don &apos;t marry him .
all those people out there are waiting for me .
yes , they are ,
but they also want you to be happy ,
which you &apos;re not going to be if you go through with this .
tell me i &apos;m wrong , and i &apos;ll leave .
you can &apos;t ,
because it should be us up there , and you know it .
it isn &apos;t that simple .
it &apos;s only that simple . you told me you loved me .
i know it was true .
it is .
of course i love you , chuck . i &apos;ve always loved you .
i love you more and more every day ,
if it &apos;s even possible to love someone that much .
then get out of here with me right now .
we can go anywhere , just as long as we &apos;re together .
i know you can &apos;t understand ,
and i don &apos;t expect you to .
but even if i weren &apos;t with louis ...
i couldn &apos;t be with you .
just know that not living with you
is the hardest thing i ever done .
but at least i have someone who loves me by my side .
you should find someone who loves you too .
i have .
she &apos;s standing right in front of me .
i know it sounds crazy ,
but i really am doing this for you .
hey , b , the photographer &apos;s ready .
it &apos;s okay , s.
chuck was just coming to give me his blessing .
right ?
that was so touching , really .
if i ever cried , i &apos;d be moved to tears .
the best part is , i got it all for posterity .
now i can &apos;t help but wonder what would louis think
if he heard how blair felt about you ?
oh , good . we found you .
don &apos;t worry . i was just leaving .
i just needed to leave my gift first .
bye .
what is going on ? it &apos;s time .
b. , are you sure you feel right about all this ?
because i am totally prepared to make a run for it with you
if that &apos;s what you want .
i &apos;ve made peace with my decision ,
and so should everyone else .
okay , if that &apos;s how you really feel .
it is .
i know you think you can &apos;t be with chuck
because of the pact you made with god ,
but maybe the pact is just an excuse you &apos;re using
to protect yourself from-- from the messiness
and uncertainty of a life with the man you really love .
i &apos;ll grow into loving louis .
i &apos;m sure of it . and he &apos;ll never hurt me .
he won &apos;t have to .
you &apos;re hurting yourself enough by marrying him .
b , no matter what &apos;s happen between you and chuck
the two of you have always been connected .
everything that you &apos;ve gone through
keeps leading you back to each other ,
just like it does dan and me ,
and i know that it scares you and i know that it &apos;s a risk ,
but don &apos;t enter into a false life
just because you &apos;re afraid to face your real one .
i am--i &apos;m so sorry .
i don &apos;t know what i was thinking .
no , it &apos;s okay .
i understand why you brought chuck .
but despite everyone &apos;s protestations ,
i &apos;m going through with this .
serena ...
will you please tell everyone i &apos;m ready to begin ?
chuck , wait .
don &apos;t worry . i &apos;m leaving .
no , that &apos;s not what i was gonna say .
you need to know something--
something that if blair knew i was telling you ,
she &apos;d probably never speak to me again .
listen , i don &apos;t want to alarm anyone ,
but there &apos;s been an emergency .
what ?
yeah . blair needs you right away .
of course . i &apos;m all hers .
come this way , please .
oh , sure .
right this way .
excuse me .
blair , my little turtle dove ,
what &apos;s the emergency ?
i need another escort .
what ? did something happen ? are you hurt ?
no , no . in fact , i feel perfect .
well , what &apos;s going on ?
you have an escort , blair-- your father .
oh , cyrus .
one father is not enough .
i need both of you to
walk me down the aisle .
all right .
all right .
beautiful .
since we have a moment alone ,
would you mind telling me why everyone seems to think
we aren &apos;t fake dating except me ?
i think i may have just done something really bad .
what did you do ?
she &apos;s beautiful .
dearly beloved ,
we are gathered in the sight of god
and in the face of this congregation
to join together this man and this woman
in holy matrimony ,
which is commended in holy writ to be honorable among all men .
if any man can show any just cause
why these two may not lawfully be joined together ,
let him now speak ,
or else hereafter forever hold his peace .
if no one else is going to say it ,
i guess i have to .
the person who should be objecting
isn &apos;t chuck bass but the bride herself .
don &apos;t believe me ? watch this .
of course i love you , chuck . i &apos;ve always loved you .
i love you more and more every day ,
if it &apos;s even possible to love someone that much .
told you my first post was worth waiting for .
now what will my next one be ?
i can &apos;t believe you did this .
good , because i didn &apos;t do it .
you really expect me to buy that ?
it doesn &apos;t matter anymore .
gossip girl just showed everyone the truth .
it &apos;s all out .
the only part she didn &apos;t tell is this crazy idea
that if you and i got together ,
something terrible would happen to me .
that &apos;s right . serena told me about the pact .
she , like me , cares about you and your future .
it &apos;s not my future i &apos;m worried about .
blair , you can &apos;t honestly believe--
what ? ! can &apos;t honestly believe that you were dead ?
because you were , and you weren &apos;t coming back .
the only thing i knew i could do in that moment
was to find a way to try and save your life ,
whatever it took .
even though i knew that once i did ,
you would never stop trying to ruin mine .
so ...
the truth is out .
but that doesn &apos;t mean i &apos;m going anywhere with you .
louis ...
what happened out there is awful .
but the part you didn &apos;t hear was that i chose you .
and i know this is humiliating ,
but if you wanna stay with me and go through with this ,
then i promise i will never humiliate you again .
excuse me , your highness .
your mother &apos;s requesting a word .
georgina .
you caught me . i &apos;m so scared .
what &apos;d you do ?
i didn &apos;t do anything .
oh , you expect us to believe
you &apos;re just an innocent bystander ?
i never said i was innocent . i just like to watch .
and while i love our annual showdowns as much as anybody ,
if you &apos;re looking for someone to blame for what just happened ,
you &apos;ve got the wrong girl .
come on , georgina .
sure , i made the video gossip girl played ,
but i didn &apos;t send it in .
i left my camera with chuck , thinking he &apos;d show the prince ,
and they &apos;d have a duel at dawn
for what &apos;s left of blair &apos;s virtue ,
or maybe it &apos;s royal fisticuffs ,
whatever those are .
chuck was in the back of the church .
if he wanted to say something , he had his chance .
it &apos;s not like him to hide behind gossip girl .
no , it isn &apos;t , is it ?
maybe you should ask yourselves
which one of you had the most to gain from sending that video in .
i know from experience it &apos;s never who you &apos;d think ,
so that rules out chuck .
maybe it was you ,
wanting to help his best friend get his girl back .
or maybe it was you ,
wanting to make sure your best friend didn &apos;t make a huge mistake .
or better still , how about you ?
sending in that video would ruin both the wedding
and chuck in blair &apos;s eyes ,
which is exactly what you want ,
since anybody with a pulse
can see you &apos;re madly in love with her .
oh , except for you .
anyway , whoever it was , the wedding &apos;s over now .
see you at the next shindig . ta @-@ ta .
serena , dan , we need you right away .
i am sorry for the outburst .
it won &apos;t happen again .
now if we can continue ...
this time , after where you left off .
where you been all night , huh ?
oh , royal groomsmen duties are vast . who knew ?
did you talk to chuck ?
no , i haven &apos;t even called .
i can &apos;t believe he did that .
i mean , after everything that happened last year ,
you would have thought he changed ,
but i guess he hasn &apos;t .
yeah .
hey . what are you guys talking about ?
oh , you know ,
just how love makes people do crazy things .
however poorly timed and inappropriate ,
what chuck did was a grand gesture .
maybe if i &apos;d done one of those
for the people i &apos;ve cared about in my life ,
i wouldn &apos;t be at this wedding alone .
excuse me for a second .
about before ...
oh , you mean what georgina said ? no , forget that .
she &apos;s--she &apos;s crazy .
no , no , i owe you an explanation .
oh . all right , go ahead .
i &apos;m sorry i lied and-- and made you carry on our ...
whatever it was longer than we had to .
you &apos;re sorry ?
is that it ? i mean , how about why you did it ?
was it for publicity for your column ,
or did you just want , like , a date
to your best friend &apos;s wedding ?
i can &apos;t figure it out .
that &apos;s because i haven &apos;t been honest with you .
and nate was right about grand gestures .
we all need to make them in our lives ,
so here &apos;s mine .
i love you , dan humphrey .
always have , always will .
serena ...
no , you don &apos;t have to respond right now .
i have some ... maid of honor things to do
before blair and louis leave .
but i really hope we can talk later .
lola .
you &apos;re an actress in your
second year at juilliard .
you &apos;re from miami . you work these jobs
to pay for school because your mother doesn &apos;t support you ,
and everyone talked about how great the office party was
for weeks after , so thank you .
you &apos;re welcome .
and , uh ... i &apos;m impressed .
well , maybe i &apos;m not the kind of person
you thought i was after all .
oh , no , you probably still are ,
but for the first time , i &apos;m actually a little interested
in finding out .
ladies and gentlemen ,
please direct your attention to where
prince louis frederic grimaldi
and princess blair cornelia waldorf grimaldi
will be sharing their last dance
before departing on their honeymoon .
oh my god .
princess blair . that &apos;s the first time i &apos;ve heard it .
and ?
thank you for giving me another chance .
oh , louis ,
the champagne hasn &apos;t gone to my head .
i &apos;m too high for it to reach me .
we &apos;ve made it , finally .
so we did .
what is it , mon cher ?
did i miss a step ?
i promised my mother i &apos;d wait
until we were on the plane , but i can &apos;t any longer .
wait for what ?
today with the eyes of the world on us ,
i had no choice but to stand by your side
after your public apology .
but that was it .
from this moment forward ,
there is nothing between us but a contract .
our marriage is all for show .
and you &apos;re going to put on the best damn show
anyone ever has .
oh , my god .
you &apos;ll smile for cameras , stand by my side ,
and wave like--like you don &apos;t have a care in the world .
but when we are alone ,
we &apos;ll be like strangers to one another ,
and it will stay that way until i say it &apos;s over .
but what about everything we &apos;ve been through ?
all those beautiful vows
you said in front of god and everyone ?
those can &apos;t just have stopped being true .
i didn &apos;t write them . dan did .
and now they mean nothing to me .
but why ? why would you wanna be married
to someone you don &apos;t love ?
my mother told me love had nothing to do with marriage .
now i know she was right .
smile .
smile for the photographers .
weddings mark one of the largest transitions
you can make in your life .
they are a new beginning ,
the next step in a person &apos;s evolution .
but evolving is a tricky thing .
you can &apos;t change without changing the world around you .
it &apos;s me .
i made a horrible mistake .
i don &apos;t know what to do .
help me . please .
and not everyone might see your transformation
the same way you do .
arthur , bring the car around .
we need to get to the st. regis fast .
but if you can make it through and truly be reborn ,
then maybe so can i.
hey , have you seen dan ?
the coordinator wants photos of us dancing .
yeah , i just saw him a few minutes ago .
hey , maybe check the other rooms .
okay .
so beginning today , the past is just a prologue .
it all starts from here .
chuck , what are you doing here ?
if anyone sees you ...
i need to apologize to blair .
where is she ?
this was the only car with the keys in it .
that &apos;s fine . just go .
oh , and if you &apos;re wondering who caught the bouquet ...
i &apos;ll never tell .
you know you love me .
