it &apos;s not woodall coming after us , it &apos;s--
sean cahill .
welcome to the new s.e.c.
we target law firms .
mr. forstman .
no .
you &apos;ll miss the opportunity to get back at harvey specter .
you &apos;ve got my 230 mil .
once the deal closes ,
you cut sidwell out .
what happened to , &quot; you think i &apos;m staying if you leave &quot; ?
yeah , that was before i knew
you were gonna screw over sidwell .
forstman doesn &apos;t throw money around
without getting something in return .
i have no other choice !
so we &apos;re just gonna go back and forth , trading favors ?
are you my lawyer or not ?
seriously , rachel ,
i couldn &apos;t have done it without you .
logan , i should go .
mike ?
right here .
did you turn off my alarm ?
i did .
it &apos;s after 9 : 00 .
i have been sleeping for--
almost six hours . i know .
and the truth is , you need more .
why would you do that ?
rachel , you &apos;ve been running back and forth
between school and the firm like a maniac .
i don &apos;t even remember the last time you got a good night &apos;s sleep .
it doesn &apos;t give you the right to do that .
plus , harvey &apos;s gonna kill me .
he &apos;ll get over it .
and i &apos;ve got three briefs to write ,
plus a paper for torts and a contracts exam tomorrow .
i don &apos;t have the luxury to sleep in .
then you need to ask harvey for a day off this week .
did he ever give you time off because you were overworked ?
no , he didn &apos;t .
exactly .
i don &apos;t want to be any different .
mr. jamieson , you are hereby remanded
to the federal penitentiary in danbury , connecticut .
you might want to call me about an appeal .
the prosecutor has a reputation for bending the rules .
you must be the infamous harvey specter .
and you must be the chump eric woodall
ordered to come after me .
chump &apos;s my name on my mother &apos;s side .
i do prefer cahill .
and i prefer you stop manufacturing bullshit
to get my clients to turn on me .
i &apos;m sorry , i &apos;m not in the manufacturing business .
i &apos;m just a humble civil servant .
and if you &apos;re as clean as you say you are ,
your clients won &apos;t have anything to give us .
unless you bully them into making things up .
oh , see , now i think you &apos;ve got us confused ,
because that sounds like something that you might do .
the point is , sean , you had a secret little plan ,
and i &apos;ve taken away your element of surprise .
have you ?
you may know i &apos;m coming ,
but do you know where or when ?
see , while you &apos;re battening down the hatches at b @-@ 4,
i might be at d @-@ 12 or h @-@ 3,
and before you know it , i have sunk your battleship .
that &apos;s a cute game .
i was more of a rock &apos; em sock &apos; em robots guy .
so you think you can knock my block off , harvey ?
i know i can , because i had eric woodall fired .
so stay the hell away from my clients ,
or i &apos;ll pave the same career path for you .
okay , your hands weren &apos;t full with eric .
they will be full with me .
harv .
you want to talk about it ?
talk about what ?
that 10,000 @-@ pound weight on your shoulders .
mike , if you feel this way now ,
what are you gonna feel like when you cut sidwell out ?
if i cut him out .
what are you talking about ?
i &apos;ve been thinking about it .
i haven &apos;t actually taken forstman &apos;s money yet .
if i can get harvey to back off before i do ,
then i might not even need it .
you want to use the idea of forstman &apos;s money to cut a deal .
but , mike , they have money too .
yeah , which they can &apos;t spend until their t.r.o. expires .
yeah , but that &apos;s next week , and it &apos;s not like
there &apos;s some huge block of shares available now .
wexler &apos;s merging two of their funds .
so what ?
so their investment parameters don &apos;t allow
for more than 4 % of their holdings in any one industry .
they have to sell a block of something .
but how do you know it &apos;s gonna be gillis industries ?
because i did the math . that &apos;s what i would do .
you think harvey will go for it ?
there &apos;s only one way to find out .
hey , i don &apos;t have any cash on me ,
but if you want to bring my luggage up ,
i &apos;ll get you on the way back .
nah , you know what ? that &apos;s okay .
i don &apos;t need a tip now that i have enough money
to buy your whole building .
yeah , what are you doing here , mike ?
well , you came to give me some friendly advice .
i thought i would return the favor .
i don &apos;t remember asking .
mm , yeah , neither did i.
walk away , harvey .
excuse me ?
you &apos;re gonna lose .
if you think you getting a little loan is gonna stop me ,
i didn &apos;t teach you much .
it &apos;s not a little loan .
i &apos;ve got one of the most powerful players in the world behind me .
which is exactly where he needs to be
to stab you in the back .
well , wherever he &apos;s standing ,
this is what i &apos;m prepared to offer logan sanders to go away .
i know i don &apos;t need to remind you
that you &apos;re legally required to run that by your client .
i just ran it by him .
no deal .
harvey . what are you ...
you haven &apos;t taken forstman &apos;s money yet .
he &apos;s got some kind of gun to your head ,
and you &apos;re just trying to use his promise of cash
as leverage against me .
this isn &apos;t a bluff , harvey .
i came here to give you a way out .
bullshit .
you came here to give yourself a way out .
but i wasn &apos;t born yesterday , and i &apos;m not giving it to you .
did you go to see sean cahill in court this morning ?
i &apos;m not in the mood for a lecture .
i &apos;m not lecturing . i &apos;m asking you a question .
yes , i did , and before you tell me
this is what we brought malone in for--
i &apos;m not going to tell you that .
good , because--
now cahill &apos;s coming directly after you .
exactly .
and you &apos;re on your way
to tell malone to concoct some bullshit
to legally get us that wexler block .
look who &apos;s been reading the papers .
i &apos;m not the only one who can read the papers , harvey .
so can you . so can mike ross .
he &apos;s gonna go after those shares .
he is now .
what are you talking about ?
he tried to buy us off .
and you turned him down .
yes , which is why i &apos;m going to see malone .
no , you &apos;re not .
jessica , we have to--
i &apos;m not saying we don &apos;t .
i &apos;m saying i &apos;m going to be the one to do it .
you know he &apos;s not gonna like it .
he doesn &apos;t have to like it .
he has to do it .
therefore , prepare thee to cut off the flesh .
shed thou no blood , nor cut thou less nor more .
but just a pound of flesh if--
louis ,
how long have you been standing there ?
long enough to become part of you .
okay , you know what ?
i don &apos;t have time for you to be creepy .
so does this mean you &apos;re doing theater again ?
yes , i am playing portia merchant of venice .
now , can you please just let me get back to--
holy shit , donna , that is a meaty part .
yeah , it &apos;s 588 lines , which i have yet to memorize .
wait .
so you &apos;re not off book ?
louis , if i were off book ,
would i be pacing around the copy room
with a script in my hand ?
all right , just calm down .
no need to panic .
when do you open ?
tonight .
tonight , and you &apos;re not off book ?
what the hell &apos;s wrong with you , donna ?
okay , this isn &apos;t helping .
i &apos;m sorry .
i didn &apos;t mean to be-
i knew it .
i bit off more than i could chew .
no , no , no , no , no , no , just relax , okay ?
i don &apos;t care if it takes all day .
we are gonna memorize these lines together .
thank you , louis .
no need .
for one canst choke on the joy of life without thy mouth full .
is that the bard ?
nope , it &apos;s the litt ,
and roughly translated , it means ,
when we &apos;re done ,
you &apos;re gonna kick shakespeare &apos;s ass .
milady .
i take it it didn &apos;t go well .
what gave it away ?
because i know you , and you don &apos;t have your usual
&quot; i &apos;m super cool mike ross &quot; face .
if you knew me that well ,
you &apos;d know i &apos;m not in the mood .
mike , i &apos;m not your enemy ,
and i don &apos;t appreciate being treated like i am .
i know .
i &apos;m sorry .
so what did harvey say ?
it &apos;s not what he said . it &apos;s what he did .
he knew what i was trying to do ,
and he called my bluff right there .
he didn &apos;t even share the offer with logan ?
no , he didn &apos;t .
but you said he had to .
you want me to sue him for that ?
so what are you gonna do ?
you know what i &apos;m gonna do .
mike .
i don &apos;t want to hear it .
i wasn &apos;t disapproving .
i just want to make sure you &apos;ve exhausted all your options .
i have .
then maybe you can--
amy , the second i bid on that block of shares ,
i &apos;ve already taken forstman &apos;s money .
mike ross &apos; office .
i &apos;ll tell him .
sidwell ?
he wants to see you .
you look good .
this isn &apos;t a social call .
all right , i take it back .
wexler is divesting a huge block of gillis industries ,
and i need you to find a creative way
to buy them for logan sanders .
if i &apos;m not mistaken , logan sanders has a t.r.o.
that actually prohibits him from buying any additional shares .
which is why you &apos;re going to set up a trust
for us to buy it for him .
that &apos;s called parking , jessica .
i know what it &apos;s called .
then maybe you also know it &apos;s illegal .
i know it can be illegal ,
and i need you to figure out a way to make it questionable .
and here i thought you came in here
to tell me how much fun last night was .
oh , speaking of last night ,
you said you blamed yourself
for helping cahill drop those cases .
so here &apos;s your chance to make up for it .
remind me never to have a moment of self @-@ reflection around you .
i &apos;m not using this as ammunition .
i am using it as motivation .
so figure out a way to set up the trust ,
and do it quickly ,
because we &apos;re running out of time .
you wanted to see me ?
come here .
i want to show you something .
lionsdale electronics ,
3 million shares ,
bought out by management .
my first lbo .
i was right out of school .
all i wanted was that first tombstone because it meant--
your first deal .
broke my cherry .
must have been nice .
it was .
but you know what the difference between you and me is ?
i was just an analyst .
i mean , sure , i did all the work ,
but i didn &apos;t do any of the work .
know what i mean ?
jonathan .
don &apos;t be modest .
i know i &apos;ve been on your case ,
but the truth is , you made this all happen .
i haven &apos;t made anything happen yet .
no , you haven &apos;t .
and there &apos;s a rule against giving out tombstones too early .
you &apos;re not supposed to jinx it .
but there &apos;s no rule against this .
we &apos;ll fill it in later .
thank you , jonathan .
you &apos;re welcome .
now go bring this bad boy home .
洛根 · 桑德斯
rachel , they loved it .
we are gonna go after piedmont in a week .
we &apos;re gonna have a lot of work to do .
give me a call when you get in .
harvey , can i help you with something ?
yes , you can help by telling me
how much longer it &apos;s gonna take
for you to find me a way to bid on that stock .
it &apos;s going to take as long as it takes .
well , it better not be more than a day ,
or i won &apos;t need it at all .
it &apos;s so good to hear this from the horse &apos;s mouth .
what &apos;s that supposed to mean ?
it means the next time you want me to break the law ,
at least have the balls to ask me yourself .
the balls ?
first off , jessica insisted on asking you herself ,
and i agreed with her , because we &apos;re on the same page .
and nobody &apos;s asking you to break the law .
we &apos;re telling you to sidestep it .
that &apos;s not the job i signed on for .
the job you signed on for
is the job we tell you you signed on for .
well , that &apos;s a bullshit justification ,
and you know it .
what i know is ,
there &apos;s a reason we make the kind of money we do .
it &apos;s because we figure out a way to get things like this done .
so stop questioning my integrity
and start doing your job .
harvey , do you have a second ?
that &apos;s about all i have .
all right , i was wondering if--
if maybe i could possibly just--
time &apos;s up .
could i get a day or two off ?
a day or two ?
a day .
i just need one day away .
are you sure that &apos;s all you need ?
i &apos;m sure .
would you also like me to make your bed ?
what ?
maybe i can triple your salary
while we &apos;re at it .
no , that &apos;s not--
no , really , what can i do
to make your life easier ?
that is not fair .
i have been juggling work and school for months now ,
and i @-@ i haven &apos;t asked for any special treatment .
you &apos;re asking now .
i &apos;m not asking for time off to go to the hamptons .
this is law school i &apos;m talking about .
you said a day away .
you didn &apos;t say anything about law school .
well , it &apos;s for law school .
well , this is your law school .
this , right here .
and by the way , we &apos;re paying you for it .
i know , and i &apos;m grateful .
if you &apos;re grateful ,
then you &apos;ll stop complaining about how much work you have to do ,
and you &apos;ll figure out how to best manage your time ,
but as far as getting time off , that &apos;s not gonna happen
if you still plan on working for me .
now , you still need a day or two off ?
no , i can manage .
thou shalt have nothing but the forfeiture
to be so taken at thy peril , jew .
why , then , let the devil give him good of it .
i &apos;ll stay no longer question .
come on , let &apos;s go . this be @-@ eth awesome .
where &apos;s your script ?
i don &apos;t need a script . i &apos;m off book .
how can you be off book ? you &apos;re not even in the play .
because i know all of willy &apos;s work by heart .
all 37 plays ?
mm @-@ hmm .
troilus and cressida .
for to be wise and love exceeds man &apos;s might .
titus andronicus .
vengeance is in my heart , death in my hand .
blood and revenge are hammering in my head .
what--what &apos;s the matter ?
are you kidding me ?
you have every word this man &apos;s ever written memorized ,
and i &apos;m on in an hour and a half ,
and i &apos;m gonna make a fool of myself .
donna , forget about my extraordinary gift
and focus on yourself .
we have done this whole play .
you know your part . it will be fine .
it &apos;s not gonna be fine .
donna .
i haven &apos;t been on the stage in years .
so you &apos;re nervous .
all great performers get nervous .
it brings out the genius .
what if i &apos;m not genius ?
what if i &apos;m not even good ?
i was pretty damn good , louis .
i was .
but i knew the odds of somebody making it were close to zero
no matter how good they were .
my father lost our money when i was 13,
and i--
i found out what it was like to struggle ,
so ...
instead of pursuing my dream ,
i chose this ...
and that let me pretend
that maybe i was good enough to make it .
but what if i wasn &apos;t ?
all right , look ,
i &apos;m gonna tell you something about myself
that i never told anyone .
i have stage fright .
got it when i was in third grade .
let it get the best of me .
i never got over it .
and i cannot let you make the same mistake .
but--
look at me .
donna victoria paulsen ,
you have never been more beautiful
and talented
and perfect than you are at this very moment .
your time is now .
and you &apos;re gonna kill it .
thank you , louis .
no .
thank you .
my middle name is roberta .
i &apos;m so sorry for that .
were you working late ?
you really have to ask ?
thought maybe it would be nice for us to lie down a little bit .
together .
i would love that ,
but if i lie down , i probably won &apos;t get back up .
i know you don &apos;t want to hear this ,
but i was thinking about it ,
and harvey did kind of give me special treatment .
mike .
he let me skip law school .
yeah .
maybe if you just find the right time to ask him , you know .
i did , and he bit my head off .
so please just let it go .
okay ?
okay .
just wish all this harvey and logan bullshit
would be over .
yeah , me too .
maybe when it is ,
we can get out of town for a weekend .
i would love that .
i &apos;m worried about cahill , harvey .
i &apos;ve checked with everyone i know .
he hasn &apos;t done a thing .
me too , which is exactly why i &apos;m worried .
jessica , i don &apos;t know what to say .
if i have to look over my shoulder every 15 seconds ,
i might as well give up right now .
okay , but it doesn &apos;t mean you stop looking altogether .
hey , do you have a minute ?
did you set up that trust ?
no .
in that case , we don &apos;t .
i did something better .
we &apos;re listening .
one of the biggest red flags at the s.e.c.
is a stock purchase with money kept in trust for clients .
we &apos;ve gone over this .
let him finish .
on the other hand ,
there &apos;s nothing unusual about a retainer .
a retainer ?
from what i gather ,
this takeover is a massive undertaking , right ?
now , i don &apos;t know how you &apos;ve structured logan &apos;s payments ,
but i think it &apos;s time he pay this firm a hefty fee up front
and something on the order of $ 20 million .
and we use $ 20 million of our own money to buy that stock .
there &apos;s nothing that prohibits us
from investing as a firm .
and when the bulk of our legal work is done ,
turns out he has money coming back .
we may just end up giving him the shares
instead of his unused retainer .
which we cannot plan
or even discuss with logan sanders in advance .
and that makes it legal ?
no .
it makes it questionable ,
because they still might figure out what we did
and make a case .
we ?
you tell me , harvey .
am i on the team now ?
sounds like you &apos;re being
a little bit of a dickhead about this whole thing ,
so i &apos;d say yes .
louis ?
do you have a minute ?
oh , no .
it could not have been that bad .
oh , it wasn &apos;t .
it was amazing .
i mean , it was like riding a bike .
i got two standing os ,
and i got you to thank for it .
well , that &apos;s great .
what &apos;s wrong ?
shylock got drunk at the after @-@ party ,
fell down a flight of stairs , and broke his ankle ,
which means the show won &apos;t go on .
no , no , no , the show must go on .
well , the show can go on .
no .
louis .
come on , you &apos;re the only one who can do it .
no , i can &apos;t .
i wanted to be a molar .
but that teacher &apos;s pet ,
dorothy mchale , got the part ,
so i was forced to be plaque .
had to wear this ridiculous flesh @-@ colored unitard
and drape myself over my classmates ,
and every parent in the audience laughed at me .
louis .
and then the next year , i got a bigger part .
walked right out onstage .
tommy gallup screams out , &quot; plaque man ! &quot;
once again , everyone laughs at me .
so right then and there , middle of the stage , i--
i peed my pants .
so i ran right off the stage ,
never went back ,
and i am not going back again .
louis .
a part like this doesn &apos;t come around very often .
you gave me a gift , and i killed it because of you .
donna , please .
i &apos;m not a lawyer , louis .
this is my chance to shine .
but i &apos;m about to lose two more glorious nights .
i &apos;ve never asked anyone for anything like this ,
but there &apos;s no other choice .
please do this for me .
please .
you want me to sell directly to you ?
i don &apos;t want you to .
you &apos;re going to .
why would i do that ?
because i &apos;m the only one who &apos;s gonna buy your block at a premium ,
instead of you flooding the market with shares
and ending up getting a discount .
that &apos;s funny .
that &apos;s exactly what someone else just told me an hour ago .
what ?
and now i &apos;ll tell you what i told him .
i &apos;ll shut everyone else out ,
but you two are gonna have to go head @-@ to @-@ head .
you &apos;re talking about a dark pool bidding war .
that &apos;s no different than what you were talking about .
you just wanted to be the only one bidding .
thanks for the scampi , mr. ross .
it was delicious .
i &apos;ll be in touch with the details .
who &apos;s the other entity ?
if you can &apos;t figure that out for yourself ,
i don &apos;t think you &apos;re likely to come out on top of this whole thing .
what the hell do you think you &apos;re doing ?
i think i &apos;m washing my hands ,
which i &apos;d like to do without you bothering me
about whatever bullshit you &apos;re here for .
bullshit ?
we &apos;ll see if the s.e.c. thinks it &apos;s bullshit
that you &apos;re buying stock illegally .
you &apos;re throwing some pretty big accusations
around for such a little guy .
you think i didn &apos;t do my homework ?
the registered bidder traces back
to a shell corporation we used six times last year .
we &apos;re allowed to play the stock market
as much as the next fellow .
you think because you &apos;re using firm money , that makes it legal ?
damn right i do ,
because we have no plan to do anything
other than keep those shares ourselves .
now who &apos;s talking bullshit ?
what are you gonna do , mike ?
you gonna run to the s.e.c. ?
you think i won &apos;t ?
these aren &apos;t your daddy &apos;s tapes , harvey .
these are the rules of the game .
then let me dial their number for you ,
because if you report us ,
they &apos;ll put a freeze on this sale ,
and by the time we get it all straightened out ,
my t.r.o. will be expired ,
and we &apos;ll be right back to where we &apos;re headed this afternoon .
you &apos;re a sore goddamn loser .
i would be if i ever lost .
see you at 6 : 00 .
guess what piece of shit lawyer
just got himself a seat in the wexler pool .
mike , what are you doing here ?
what do you mean ? the sale &apos;s not until 6 : 00 .
didn &apos;t you check your messages ?
no . why ?
columbia university called .
rachel was taken to the hospital .
rachel zane .
sorry ?
you have a patient here , rachel zane .
what room is she in ?
miss zane is resting and can--
what room is she in ?
as i was saying , she can &apos;t have any visitors .
look at me . i &apos;m gonna ask you one more time .
mike . she &apos;s in 1024 .
you &apos;ve seen her ?
it &apos;s locked .
i don &apos;t care .
what are you gonna do ?
you gonna break the door down ?
yeah , if i have to .
i spoke to her doctors .
they said she fainted at school . she &apos;s fine .
if she fainted , she &apos;s not fine .
they said she &apos;s run down and a little dehydrated
but that she &apos;s okay .
okay , so then--then why won &apos;t they let us see her ?
because she &apos;s sleeping , and she needs it .
mike , she &apos;s fine .
she &apos;s gonna be fine .
what are you even doing here ?
i &apos;m one of her emergency contacts .
they called me .
yeah , i know , but--
what &apos;s a heartless shithead like me
doing in a place like this ?
yeah , something like that .
i would have come for you if you ever
worked hard enough to pass out ,
but you never did .
look , there &apos;s a steakhouse across the street .
why don &apos;t you and i go get something to eat ?
what , you gonna break the door down and wake her up ?
no , i &apos;m gonna wait outside of it
and be there when she does .
yeah , which won &apos;t happen
for another eight hours ,
because they sedated her to make sure she got some sleep .
come on , let &apos;s go get some food .
don &apos;t you need to be at an auction ?
right now , i don &apos;t want to be at that sale
any more than you do .
you &apos;re saying you &apos;re willing to postpone it ?
i &apos;m saying i already did . come on .
no , i &apos;m telling you , dr. lipschitz ,
this is like the whole plaque incident all over again .
yes , i have told you about the plaque incident ,
at least twice . i &apos;ve--
no , that-- you know , it doesn &apos;t--
you know what , forget it . that &apos;s not the point .
the point is , is that i &apos;m supposed to be
leaving for the theater in ten minutes ,
and i am a complete wreck .
i have the worst case of cotton mouth
in the history of--
what ? no , you can talk with cotton mouth .
that &apos;s frickin &apos; lockjaw .
you know something , doc ?
sometimes i just think that i &apos;ve wasted
every single monday , wednesday , and friday
for the last 14 years .
you know , this is the first time we &apos;ve
ever had a steak dinner .
i didn &apos;t know you were keeping a tally .
it &apos;s pretty easy to do when the grand total is zero .
i know .
i said i wanted to take you out
the night you told me you were leaving .
we never got around to it .
i never got around to it .
what &apos;s the real reason you were at the hospital tonight ?
the truth ?
rachel asked me for some time off ,
and i all but spit in her face .
so you felt guilty ?
pretty much .
plus , i knew you needed something
to take your mind off her ,
but i can see this dinner with me isn &apos;t working , so ...
here .
holy shit .
what is this ?
louis is in a play .
you wanted to cheer me up ,
and you didn &apos;t start the night with this ? come on .
i wanted to save something for dessert .
oh , my god , that &apos;s got to be a codpiece , right ?
what are you asking me for ?
i don &apos;t want to know if louis is packing that kind of heat .
you think i do ?
you &apos;re the one who went mudding with him .
it was covered in mud .
how much mud ?
stop .
why would i ask that ?
oh , man .
i shouldn &apos;t be laughing at him .
he still hasn &apos;t forgiven me for using sheila against him .
mike , you did what you had to do .
you don &apos;t think that was crossing a line ?
it was way over the line .
but i got to tell you , it was brilliant .
it was harsh , but it was brilliant .
you know , harvey , i @-@ i never told you .
what you did with gillis ...
i know you had to do it .
like i said before ,
we do what we need to do .
louis , you &apos;re almost up .
oh , christ , you &apos;re sweating more than nixon .
i &apos;ve gone through four elizabethan collars and a codpiece .
okay , just breathe . you &apos;re gonna be fine .
no , i can &apos;t do it .
louis , we are in the middle of the play .
you &apos;ll have to ad @-@ lib .
make something up . say shylock went away .
say that he went to israel .
oh , my god .
i don &apos;t even know what-- you know what ?
i never thought you &apos;d be so weak .
okay , why do you got to say something hurtful right now ?
oh , screw hurt !
turn that into rage .
why would i do--
you always turn hurt into rage , you idiotic piece of shit .
it is what you do .
okay , now i &apos;m mad at you .
good !
now , imagine you &apos;re in court .
court , how ?
it &apos;s too hard with the curtain .
just do it , dipshit .
okay , fine , i &apos;m in court , god damn it .
you happy now ?
no , i &apos;m not happy , you idiot .
now , you &apos;re in court ,
and you &apos;re enraged , and you are fit to kill .
now , do you see that audience out there ?
that &apos;s your jury .
they &apos;re a bunch of morons .
yeah , they &apos;re beneath you , aren &apos;t they ?
they &apos;re beneath everybody .
what else ?
they &apos;re a bunch of civil servants
who can &apos;t keep up with what i &apos;m saying .
you have absolute and total contempt for them , don &apos;t you ?
i want to rip out their stupid brains from their stupid heads .
exactly .
now , get out there and make your case .
unless of course you &apos;re a pussy
and you were meant to play plaque your whole life .
3,000 ducats .
i &apos;m gonna head back .
hey , tell rachel she should take the day off tomorrow .
thanks for this , harvey .
excuse me .
which one of you is franklin ,
and which one of you is bash ?
did you boys have a nice date ?
couldn &apos;t be better . he even paid .
oh , i guess he &apos;s flush with cash .
ever since he left you in order to do investment banking .
i &apos;m sorry . do i know you ?
no , but i know you . mike ross .
sean here is with the s.e.c. ,
and he &apos;s using his position to harass my clients
on behalf of eric woodall .
actually , not anymore , harvey .
i decided to take your advice and focus on you .
are you following me ?
oh , i &apos;ve got guys who do that .
then you also better have authorization
from the justice department .
getting authorization was easy ,
because i told them you two
are on opposite sides of a takeover battle .
and that your girlfriend is your associate .
are you trying to say that we &apos;re colluding ?
oh , you went right there , didn &apos;t you ?
because you led him there .
well , in the six hours that i &apos;ve been there ,
this is what i &apos;ve learned .
your girlfriend , who i just mentioned works for you ,
faints at law school for five minutes .
you guys meet at the hospital .
then you have dinner for two hours
where you cancel a private stock sale
that you both arranged ,
and one hour ago ,
that stock mysteriously gets bought
by some shell corporation set up last year .
wait , what ?
bullshit .
here &apos;s my favorite part ,
where you feign outrage and you feign ignorance
to help sell the whole story .
anyway , i just wanted to give you a little heads @-@ up .
smile for the cameras . harvey .
you gave me your word .
and i kept it .
oh , yeah , then what about this stock ?
jessica must have done it .
bullshit .
no , it &apos;s not bullshit .
yeah , and when were you planning on telling me
this guy was up your ass for collusion ?
i didn &apos;t know about this until five seconds ago .
there are only so many things i can buy , harvey .
listen to me ,
we can deal with this guy &apos;s bullshit later .
right now , let me deal with the stock situation .
i &apos;ll make it right .
you can &apos;t make it right .
mike , you used to trust me .
i need you to trust me right now .
rachel , wake up .
hey . where were you so late ?
i was out , thinking .
thinking what ?
i don &apos;t want to be a fraud .
what ?
i love you .
i &apos;m married to her ,
but i don &apos;t want to do that anymore .
i want to be married to you .
logan .
rachel ...
will you marry me ?
i can &apos;t .
why not ?
because you &apos;ll always be a fraud .
how can you say that to me ?
you okay ?
come on , go back to sleep .
i &apos;ll be here when you wake up .
who told you to buy that stock ?
excuse me ?
let me start again .
hello , jessica .
i just found out we bought the wexler block .
would you by any chance know how that came to happen ?
it came to happen when i found out
the dark pool had been canceled and i couldn &apos;t reach you .
so you took it upon yourself to make a preemptive bid .
of course i did .
if i hadn &apos;t , forstman would have .
so why are you here ?
i gave mike my word we &apos;d postpone the sale .
well , i didn &apos;t give mike anything .
do you even want to know why ?
not particularly .
it was because rachel passed out at school
and was in the hospital .
is she all right ?
do you care ?
don &apos;t you make me out to be the villain in this , harvey .
i am sorry rachel fainted ,
but our obligation is to our client ,
and i &apos;m not undoing that sale .
we can &apos;t tonight anyway .
why not ?
because cahill came out of nowhere .
he &apos;s been having me followed .
he thinks mike and i are colluding on gillis ,
and if we undo that sale , it &apos;ll just fuel the fire .
i told you i was still worried about him .
what did you want me to do ?
have myself tailed to pick up a possible tail ?
what did you come in here to tell me , harvey ?
now that sean cahill is involved ,
we also can &apos;t ever transfer those shares to logan .
which conveniently helps fix your deal with mike ross .
jessica--
you know what ?
doesn &apos;t matter . we don &apos;t need to transfer them .
we &apos;ll just vote logan &apos;s way when the time comes .
jessica , i gave mike my word .
harvey , i don &apos;t care if you took a blood oath .
our duty is to our client ,
not a handshake with mike ross .
and this discussion is over .
checked you out .
you &apos;re free to go on your own recognizance .
how much was bail ?
oh , it &apos;s okay , i took care of it .
how are you feeling ?
you know , i &apos;m actually feeling--
i &apos;m feeling pretty good .
in fact , i think that i &apos;m going--
rachel , no , you can &apos;t do any work today .
i &apos;m just gonna stop by the office
and put away just three files , send four emails .
that &apos;s it .
i have to do this just for my own peace of mind .
no more .
no more .
i won &apos;t even tell anybody that i &apos;m there .
i won &apos;t .
louis , can i talk to you for a minute ?
of course .
first of all , you were remarkable last night .
who said ?
everyone in the cast .
the flushing chronicle ?
um , you know , i don &apos;t actually read the local--
you should , because they said i was a shock to the senses .
i bought six copies this morning .
i &apos;m gonna send five to esther ,
because she thinks she &apos;s such a great singer .
okay .
louis , what i came in here to say--
donna , i &apos;m retiring .
you &apos;re what ?
you helped me get over a fear
that i never thought i &apos;d get over .
but i don &apos;t want to see the audience as the jury .
i don &apos;t want to have disdain for them .
i am the audience ,
and i want to love them .
louis .
donna , i &apos;m sorry .
because i know i &apos;m taking away
your last glorious night from you ,
but i can &apos;t go on again .
i , um ...
i can &apos;t do it .
it &apos;s okay , louis .
it &apos;s okay .
it turns out that the other shylock
only sprained his ankle .
looks like he &apos;s gonna be able to go on tonight after all .
wait a minute .
he never hurt his ankle at all , did he ?
you know , i just knew that you had
a lot of things going on lately with harvey and malone ,
and sometimes the best way to deal with
disappointment in one arena
is to accomplish something else .
thank you .
you &apos;re welcome , louis .
hey , remember when you said that you &apos;re not a lawyer ?
you could be .
got donna &apos;s message . what &apos;s going on ?
how &apos;s rachel ?
she &apos;s good . resting .
mike .
god damn it , i knew it .
i knew you wouldn &apos;t fix it .
i tried .
you tried ?
you &apos;re a name partner .
and she &apos;s the managing partner , and you know it .
that wouldn &apos;t have made a difference
if you were fighting for you .
i fought jessica for you and won more than once ,
but this isn &apos;t one of those times , mike .
believe me , this isn &apos;t what i wanted .
my mistake was believing you when you gave me your word .
no .
i made the mistake by not believing in you
the second you brought me your takeover plan .
look , i don &apos;t have a lot of regrets .
it &apos;s just not who i am .
but this is one of them .
if i could go back and change it , i would ,
but i can &apos;t .
is that supposed to stop me ?
no , i just wanted you to know it .
do what you have to do .
mr. ross , what can i help you with ?
actually , nothing .
nothing ?
what do you mean nothing ?
i mean i made a mistake .
i &apos;m gonna find another way to win this thing .
i &apos;m grateful , but i &apos;m not gonna need your money anymore .
you may not need my money ,
but you &apos;ve got it .
what are you talking about ?
you think i didn &apos;t know what you were up to ?
you tried not to fund the money ,
so you could leverage specter out of the deal
and get out of our deal .
how ...
did i know ?
i &apos;ve done the same thing a hundred times .
i &apos;m actually glad you did it ,
because now i know
the kind of person i &apos;m in bed with .
a sneaky little shit like me .
yeah , do you know the difference between you and me ?
i &apos;m not taking the money
because i don &apos;t want to screw over my partner .
and if i were you ,
i wouldn &apos;t want to screw him over either .
that man has nothing but wonderful things
to say about you .
you had him take the money , didn &apos;t you ?
he couldn &apos;t believe it hadn &apos;t happened already .
he told me he &apos;s having a little tombstone made up for you .
mike , we are partners on this ,
whether you like it or not .
what are you doing here ?
i &apos;m here to deliver these .
who are those for ?
who do you think they &apos;re for ?
for you , for your dressing room .
thank you .
let &apos;s go .
you &apos;re coming ?
you think i &apos;m gonna miss your closing night ?
i didn &apos;t know you were a shakespeare fan .
i &apos;m a donna fan .
you know , harvey , you don &apos;t have to do this .
i know you got a lot going on with mike .
the only thing i got going on tonight is you .
