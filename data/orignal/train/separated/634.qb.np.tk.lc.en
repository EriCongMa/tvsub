my father was an innocent man ,
destroyed by powerful people .
the graysons are behind this , and they &apos;re gonna pay .
i &apos;ve dedicated my life to avenging his death .
eventually , someone &apos;s gonna find you out .
and i won &apos;t stop until they &apos;ve all paid the price .
maybe your new financial advisor can help you
find your way out of the red .
surely , aiden , you of all people should know
the graysons are completely bankrupt !
together we &apos;re going to destroy that little bitch .
victoria took the bait .
thank you for coming back .
well , i knew that if you reached out to me ,
i must be the only one you could turn to .
my mother warned me not to trust you .
yet here you are .
well , i like to draw my own conclusions .
amanda clarke was my friend .
she knew what conrad did to her father .
i want you to persuade him to confess .
i &apos;m turning myself in to the authorities .
if you get in that car ,
i swear it &apos;ll be the last thing you do !
father paul !
emily .
conrad grayson involved in m.v.a. ,
blood pressure--170 / 100 , pulse--120,
possible head trauma . c.t. scan recommended .
paul whitley b.p.-- 40 over palp ,
possible spinal injury ,
significant blood lost at scene .
please hold on .
you need to wait here .
victoria , you &apos;re crying .
&quot; adam and eve banished from eden . &quot;
it &apos;s my first randolph .
it &apos;s prophetic ,
as conrad was the serpent all along ,
dragging me to hell with him .
now he &apos;s going to do something
to destroy me and this entire family .
losing our fortune proved insufficient .
now he &apos;s going to die and leave me
with the shame of his sins .
god ... have mercy on my soul .
you act like you &apos;re-- you &apos;re bound to conrad
with no way out .
you are vicky harper--
the woman who made an enviable life from nothing .
that &apos;s who i was once .
that &apos;s who you are now .
and i know that ...
because you and i are the same .
now you have everything you need
to change your life right here in this room .
sell this collection .
and we &apos;ll leave the hamptons .
i have tried to leave him so many times .
but i can &apos;t abandon charlotte and daniel
to deal with conrad &apos;s mess .
my children need me now more than ever .
mrs. grayson ?
there &apos;s been an accident .
you get a chance to look over my remodel ideas , j.p. ?
success is all about branding .
well , branding can keep calling me &quot; jack . &quot;
but i did check &apos; em out , and i &apos;m down for a few changes .
what &apos;s all this ?
invitations to the wedding of the century .
maid of honor reporting for duty .
i thought you were into it .
emily and i have hit a few bumps lately .
i &apos;m trying the bygones thing
because she &apos;s marrying my brother in eight weeks .
but sometimes , i swear , i don &apos;t know the real emily .
so are you thinking of asking margaux to the wedding ?
i &apos;m not going to the wedding .
not going ?
i need a little break from emily thorne .
we &apos;re losing him .
still in v @-@ tach .
charge again . clear !
come on , come on .
he &apos;s still in v @-@ tach . nothing .
damn it .
time of death--23 : 36 .
emily .
any news ? i ...
i haven &apos;t heard much of anything out here .
father paul &apos;s gone .
he went into cardiac arrest ...
and they couldn &apos;t save him .
i &apos;m sorry to hear that .
yeah , he was a good man .
he was taken too soon .
you know , victoria didn &apos;t say much about him
on the drive over here ...
or about conrad , for what it &apos;s worth .
have you seen him ?
no .
daniel made it clear i wasn &apos;t needed in the room .
he ... said it was family only .
i know when i &apos;m not welcome .
the graysons tend to close ranks in moments like these .
just tell my mother i &apos;ll be at the manor
if she needs me .
just please , try charlotte again .
she must not have got my messages ,
as i &apos;m sure she would be here .
still , i &apos;d rather she not learn about my accident on ...
twitter .
oh , and yet you were so eager to air your confession
for all the world to hear on the evening news .
it seems that your father &apos;s dying wish
is to put a final nail in the family coffin
by publicly admitting to framing david clarke .
that &apos;s where he was headed .
why on earth would you confess ?
because my time with paul inspired a spiritual conversion .
though this near death experience
may have put an end to that rationally conceived notion .
you better hope he survives ,
because the doctors ordered you not to drive with huntington &apos;s .
father paul &apos;s dead .
i knew it was a bad choice .
he &apos;s very persuasive .
look , i bought that ferrari new in &apos; 86 .
it was a gift to myself for cracking the forbes 100 .
anyway , paul and i test drove it together ,
and he really showed me what that car could do .
are you rehearsing the sob story you &apos;re planning on telling
at your manslaughttrial ?
no , my dear , i merely want you to understand
how father paul came to be behind the wheel
at the time of the accident .
what ?
he wanted to relive a memory .
it breaks my heart that i let him .
i will not be complicit
in your ridiculously obvious lie .
and good luck getting the authorities
to swallow this tripe .
em ... em , you-- you were first on the scene .
what did you see ?
the car was on fire .
father paul &apos;s body was thrown about 15 feet in front of it .
and where was i ?
you came up from behind me .
i was nowhere near the driver &apos;s side of the vehicle , correct ?
yes .
nowhere near .
you are my guardian angel , emily .
lord knows where i &apos;d be without you .
well , the man &apos;s s a survivor .
that &apos;s because conrad caused the accident .
i don &apos;t think he ever intended to confess ,
and he made damn sure that father paul didn &apos;t either .
yeah , i don &apos;t know , ems .
i mean , murder by auto accident ?
conrad is pretty psychotic ,
but why would he risk his own life ?
well , he &apos;s not afraid to die .
that &apos;s a side effect of convincing somebody
that they &apos;ve got a terminal disease .
can we just talk about the elephant in the mansion ?
that maybe the crash was due to another
fake huntington &apos;s em @-@ isode ?
i lowered his dosage yesterday
so he &apos;d be healthy enough to turn himself in .
god , if conrad would have been too ill to drive ...
don &apos;t blame yourself .
i need to find the car , prove that conrad was driving .
can you get me into the police database ?
um , with , uh , my library card ?
ems , tech time @-@ out , remember ?
plus i , uh ,
have my own grayson revenge @-@ agenda this week .
aiden , since you &apos;re living at the manor ,
keep your ears peeled around conrad .
and in the meantime ...
replace his medication with these .
maybe there &apos;s a chance he &apos;ll still confess
if he thinks he &apos;s at death &apos;s door .
thank goodness conrad survived .
with nary a lasting injury .
in fact , he &apos;s being released from the hospital this morning .
how much more can the poor man endure ?
trust me , sheila , that man will always rise above .
oh , look at what you &apos;ve accomplished .
turning this into the hamptons &apos; premiere gallery .
having victoria grayson as a loyal customer
helped cement this gallery &apos;s reputation .
i &apos;m honored to have helped you build your collection .
and i trust we &apos;ve built a friendship over the years as well .
of course we have .
well , i can only hope that you &apos;ll help in turn .
i used to be an art consultant many years ago .
and now that i &apos;m an empty nester
with a husband incapable of working ,
i was looking to reignite my passion .
darling , i heard all about your money troubles .
so are you offering up your services or ...
asking me for a job ?
it &apos;s the latter .
well , then the job is yours .
and , of course , we &apos;ll have a welcome reception
to fete your renaissance .
oh , this announcement will bring tons of traffic into the gallery .
i trust you &apos;ll call and invite all your friends
to come and see the new ... improved victoria grayson .
i will .
and thank you , sheila .
i don &apos;t know how to repay such a kindness .
sorry to interrupt your meeting ,
but i needed to see you .
um , can we talk about the accident for a second ?
oh , perfect timing then . this is detective march .
he &apos;ll be handling the investigation .
emily thorne .
that &apos;s funny , because i was the first on the scene ,
and no one &apos;s taken my statement .
i already gave it to him .
yeah , they &apos;re pretty clear about what happened .
yeah , seems there was driver error
on father paul &apos;s part .
he just took the curve too fast .
lost control .
and for his quick response ...
the graysons are proud to support the local authorities .
well , then i guess that &apos;s settled .
yeah , it will be . i &apos;ll see you later , okay ?
yeah .
um , miss thorne ? miss thorne ?
did mr. grayson look almost finished ?
because the magazine launches next week ,
and his publisher &apos;s bio is due to the printer in minutes .
the profile introducing daniel to the readers of &quot; voulez &quot; ?
exactly . and ms. lemarchal will have me fired ,
unless i get at least one personal detail about him .
i &apos;d be happy to give you a statement .
nolan .
patrick .
you know , for a guy with an amazing pool ,
you sure do spend a lot of time at this beach club .
i &apos;m just ... trying to justify the king &apos;s ransom
i spend in membership dues .
so ... what brings you to our pristine shores ?
the inevitability of the tide .
what comes in must go out , right ?
thinking maybe it &apos;s time for me to move on .
leaving the hamptons so soon ?
you ever feel like you don &apos;t belong ?
story of my life .
enjoy the beach .
i &apos;m gonna go for a swim .
charlotte , dear ...
uh , could you ... please call me back ?
all i &apos;m asking for is a minute of your time ...
what is it , detective ?
oh , i had it moved off site . daniel didn &apos;t tell you ?
piedmont salvage yard .
yeah , have it taken care of quickly .
and , uh , don &apos;t call again .
welcome home .
what the hell are you doing here ?
i just moved into your pool house .
oh , well , i just got off the phone with the police .
i &apos;m happy to call them back .
why ?
so you can have me arrested on another trumped up charge ?
or are you scared ?
of being killed in my sleep by a coward like you ?
damn straight .
bianca , could you please inform the staff that mr. mathis here
is to be denied access to the manor ?
and , uh , have the doors to my suite and study
locked at all times during his inevitably short stay .
yes , mr. grayson .
so why don &apos;t you go back to your cabana ?
and then prepare to keep going back over the ocean .
well , if you still ran this house ,
i ... might actually be scared .
conrad &apos;s car is at piedmont salvage yard ,
and you should know that
daniel &apos;s in the thick of it , too .
i know . i just caught him giving my statement
to the officer handling the case .
i don &apos;t know why i &apos;m surprised , but i am .
that &apos;s because no one can be trusted .
emily , look , i &apos;m .. i &apos;m sorry . i know this is
the closest you &apos;ve come to clearing your father &apos;s name .
i &apos;m not giving up .
well , at least .. at least take a minute .
okay , i @-@ i know you well enough to know
that you &apos;re not okay . just ...
talk to me .
i &apos;m fine .
i gotta go .
look , i just wanted you to know that
i don &apos;t think conrad &apos;s gonna confess .
i &apos;m sorry if i got your hopes up .
is this another one of your plans gone sideways ?
no , jack . this is conrad getting away with murder .
you know what ? i shouldn &apos;t have come .
hang on . let me help you .
no . no way .
emily ...
this man has killed my wife . he &apos;s killed my brother .
all i ever wanted is to find a way to make him pay
for something .
anything ...
look , jack , i need you to stay out of this .
hey , it &apos;s jack .
i need some info .
&quot; and daniel grayson has always risen above adversity
&quot; to embrace new challenges .
&quot; following a drunk driving accident ,
&quot; which nearly killed his passenger ,
&quot; he saw it as a wake @-@ up call ,
&quot; joining then rising through the ranks
of his father &apos;s company , eventually running it . &quot;
now this has gone to print ,
and will be in every copy of the first issue .
they wanted details making you
more relatable to the readers .
so you told them about my d.u.i. ?
what the hell were you thinking ? !
i think it shows how far you &apos;ve come .
oh , no , no , no . you &apos;re a smart woman , emily thorne .
this was passive @-@ aggressive .
hell , this was aggressive . you were ...
you were trying to hurt me .
that &apos;s ridiculous .
is it because i &apos;ve been too busy with work ?
is that why ? come on . give me a reason .
and i want the truth .
how dare you demand the truth .
you &apos;re right , daniel . i &apos;m not an idiot .
i know exactly what was happening this morning .
oh , and this was in retaliation ?
did you stop for a second to think about
why i helped my father ?
does it matter ? it &apos;s disgusting .
i thought you were better than conrad ,
but you &apos;re just as wrapped up in his lies .
yeah , right ,
&apos;cause you &apos;re such an open book . where are you going ?
i &apos;m not doing this .
you walk out that door ,
and i &apos;m not gonna be here when you get back .
then don &apos;t forget to turn on the alarm .
yes , at the sheila lurie gallery .
oh , jordan , thank you for your support .
i &apos;ll see you then . bye , now .
still making phone calls , i see .
well , the more clients i secure ,
the faster i &apos;ll be fiscally independent from this marriage .
and i want that gallery swarming .
although i &apos;m loathe to endure the stares of friends
who relish my predicament .
well , let &apos; em stare .
then when you &apos;re back on top , they &apos;ll kiss your ass .
why don &apos;t you take a walk with me on the beach ?
it &apos;s where i go to clear the cobwebs .
oh , i would love to , but i have invites to extend ,
and i need to reach out to daniel and charlotte .
i really need their support .
patrick .
how to dig up your skeletons .
no .
nolan .
no technology .
it &apos;ll only get you into trouble .
oh . just ... once ...
then i can stop .
i can stop anytime .
and if i can &apos;t stop , then i can write a program ...
that will make me stop .
sweet chord of connectivity .
come to papa .
it &apos;s beautiful .
it is .
and it &apos;s also victoria grayson &apos;s .
so might i ask how it came to be in your hands ?
oh , um ... i &apos;m her son .
i had heard through the grapevine
that victoria &apos;s first born had ... resurfaced .
and now he stands here intending ...
if i catch your drift ...
to fence one of her more valuable pieces ?
well , i &apos;m leaving the hamptons ,
and i could use a little traveling money .
what can i tell you ?
i &apos;m a bastard in more ways than one .
as much as i love it , i simply can &apos;t risk
purchasing a piece of this caliber
without the proper paperwork .
it &apos;s illegal .
hey , how &apos;s the sultan enjoying his pollock , by the way ?
i heard about your hobby of , uh ...
somehow acquiring certain rare and valuable pieces
and then privately reselling them
to high @-@ end international buyers .
unless , of course , the grapevine was wrong .
you said it yourself . this is a valuable piece .
how should we handle this ?
you know , the more i know you , the less i know you .
jack , what are you doing here ?
you can &apos;t be here !
and you can ?
i &apos;m not just gonna sit around
and let conrad get away with murder .
let me deal with him .
we can fight , or we can get to work .
but i &apos;m not going anywhere .
i think i found something .
i just took a video of the entire car .
look at the steering wheel .
that &apos;s housing for an air bag that conrad had installed .
though it must have deployed when the car hit the pole .
that &apos;s why conrad has burns on his face
and father paul doesn &apos;t .
this could really prove that conrad was driving ,
which means that he had the air bag
removed and destroyed before they towed the car .
jack , look , just give me your phone .
i &apos;ll download the video and take care of it .
no .
jack--
i &apos;ve been waiting for my moment
to make this bastard pay , and it &apos;s finally here .
you can &apos;t do this .
there could be consequences .
you didn &apos;t think about that when you lied to me for two years .
so either i get to tell this truth ...
or the other one .
your call .
so ... what &apos;s the 4 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 , hon ?
i found proof .
conrad should be arrested sometime today .
wait , wait , wait . so isn &apos;t that good news ?
no . because jack came to the salvage yard last night
and demanded he do the honors .
i thought you promised never to pull him into this .
i didn &apos;t . he wouldn &apos;t listen .
well , i &apos;m not waiting around for the fallout .
where are you headed to ?
oh , just a ... quick sojourn to the sunshine state .
what are you all dolled up for ?
a reception at the sheila lurie gallery .
it seems victoria &apos;s gotten herself a job .
so what , you &apos;re going to , uh ,
support the working classless ?
i did something rash .
daniel didn &apos;t come home last night .
i figure a public forum
is the easiest place to make amends .
are you sure you want to be around victoria
after what just happened at my party ?
it &apos;ll be fun to watch her try not to lose it .
lucinda , you know victoria .
yes , we &apos;ve served on several boards together over the years .
yes .
well , i assume you &apos;ll have no time for that
now that you &apos;re working . how unexpected .
it &apos;s a coup for me . victoria knows her stuff .
she was my biggest customer till just a few months ago . mm .
browse , lucinda .
excuse me , ladies .
when you said you &apos;d taken a job ,
i had to see it to believe it .
well , i &apos;m asserting a little independence
from your father .
and i can see it had its desired effect ,
as i hope you &apos;ve come to support me .
yeah , mom , i have .
i &apos;m actually proud of you .
oh , sweetie .
it &apos;s a beautiful gallery , victoria .
what are you doing here ?
well , i wanted to show my support .
i feel terrible after what happened at nolan &apos;s party .
i &apos;ll never forget what you did to my reputation ,
nor forgive .
maybe in time .
after all , i will be a grayson in a few weeks .
well , if you &apos;re looking for daniel , he &apos;s not here .
maybe he &apos;s still at the family suite at the southfork inn .
must be trouble in paradise .
nothing we can &apos;t work out .
well , thank you for coming , emily .
feel free to leave anytime .
well , since i &apos;m here , i thought i &apos;d have a look around .
i &apos;d love to give you your first commission .
so ... that &apos;s what &apos;s been up with you .
you &apos;re having problems with my brother .
we &apos;ll be fine .
excuse me .
你去过警局了吗
yeah , all right . okay , well , thank you .
thank you , thank you .
detective march says you &apos;re in the clear .
oh ?
the car has been demolished .
father paul &apos;s body has been claimed by the monastery , and ...
the case is officially closed .
well , let &apos;s toast to that .
i gotta head over to mom &apos;s reception .
i don &apos;t want to miss emily .
we had a pretty bad fight last night .
over what ?
believe it or not ,
she gave &quot; voulez &quot; my d.u.i. story for my bio .
you do realize that &apos;s a power play , son .
what do you mean by that ?
well , i presume you don &apos;t consider my marriage
a paragon of excellence ,
but the thing that &apos;s kept the fire lit all these years
is that we know how to fight , but not surrender .
now you go to emily now ,
and you are admitting defeat .
i see your point .
good , because ... i won &apos;t be around
to dole out these nuggets forever .
then tell me the truth .
what really caused the crash ?
oh , i took the turn too fast .
i might have hit the clutch instead of the brake
and made poor father paul the first victim
of my huntington &apos;s .
but you had the good sense to help me cover it up .
i didn &apos;t do it for you .
i can &apos;t have the family dragged through the mud
one week before my magazine launch .
i &apos;m finally making a name for myself ,
building it with hard work , not legacy .
i have something to lose now .
this is conrad .
the humidity here is awful .
you must be from l.a.
new york .
damn it . i &apos;m usually right .
you know what i love about the south ?
people are so friendly .
it &apos;s a product of bible belt fear .
but trust me , there are some ...
less than desirable folks around here .
like your , uh ... ex @-@ husband ?
patrick osbourne , right ?
who the hell are you ?
i @-@ i @-@ if he sent you here--
no , he ... he didn &apos;t .
i &apos;m just ... looking into him for a friend .
patrick is a user and a liar .
and that &apos;s all i have to say .
whoa , whoa , whoa , wait , wait , wait .
i need details .
would , uh ...
$ 20,000 change your mind ?
i apologize in advance .
all hundreds .
what do you want to know ?
this would be beautiful in your home .
and an acquisition at this price point
would be a major asset to your portfolio .
victoria , there you are .
while i applaud your go @-@ getter attitude ,
one of the track lights has been out for ten minutes .
i &apos;ll finish up with this sale .
sheila , can we have a word for a moment ?
excuse us .
yes . thank you .
i was going to do this later ,
but i received a curious phone call this morning
from a friend of mine-- jordan sawyer .
does that name ring a bell ?
why ?
well , you brokered the deal for him
to add a randolph to his collection--
one he knew i possessed .
well , i can undo that deal .
but we still have a problem .
you sold a piece of art that i own .
now you are seasoned enough to know that
buying and selling art without the proper ownership paperwork
is larceny .
you should know that your son patrick brought it to me .
so if i go down , then so does he .
and your family does not need another scandal .
oh , well , everyone knows about our financial situation .
so i have nothing more to lose ,
but you have everything to lose .
what do you want , victoria ?
you always have an end game .
but i didn &apos;t have an end game before this .
and not even when i came to an old friend
to ask for a little grace , a little mercy .
and i helped you . i hired you .
no .
you took pleasure in my family &apos;s hardships .
and you tried to humiliate me with that little reception .
so when i found out that you sold my art behind my back ,
that &apos;s when i developed an end game , as you call it .
you disappoint me .
i &apos;m calling the police .
please . please , please , please , no , i ...
okay ... while this started as my welcoming party ,
it &apos;s now your farewell to the hamptons .
so go out there and tell everyone
that this is my gallery now ...
right after you change this bulb .
jordan got the randolph back to me in mint condition .
and our plan worked perfectly .
the gallery &apos;s mine .
see ? i knew you still had a little harper in you .
you took a huge risk just to make me happy .
neither daniel nor charlotte
have ever made me feel so special .
sorry i haven &apos;t returned your messages .
i just got back .
from handing over the evidence ?
i &apos;ve been burned too many times
by accepting what &apos;s in front of me as true .
so before i turn this in , i wanted to run it by vince .
he &apos;s a mechanic .
we were right about the air bag .
but there &apos;s something else .
this is the brake fluid reservoir
in the trunk of conrad &apos;s car .
and that is a puncture that vince says
could not have been made by the impact .
someone tampered with the brakes .
that &apos;s what caused the accident .
it doesn &apos;t matter who was driving .
i thought i had him . i thought i had him .
i have to go .
conrad has news .
oh . keep me in the loop .
if i &apos;m in danger again , i &apos;d like to know .
what are you doing here ? this is reckless .
someone tampered with conrad &apos;s brakes .
that &apos;s what caused the crash and killed father paul .
aiden , i need to know it wasn &apos;t you .
after everything i &apos;ve done , you still don &apos;t trust me ?
you &apos;ve gone rogue before .
just tell me .
i didn &apos;t do it .
i came back here to help you finish this your way .
okay .
so how did you know
that conrad &apos;s brakes were tampered with ?
there &apos;s proof . but i don &apos;t have it .
jack does .
wh--porter . you--you-- you went to him , but how ?
does jack know who you really are ?
how long ?
since the night of the election .
he was going to kill conrad . i had to protect him .
i &apos;ll explain later . i &apos;m sorry .
well , i think mark &apos;s father
had a huge influence on him .
really ?
what &apos;s the news ?
i don &apos;t know .
my father insisted we all be here , so ...
unseasonably chilly tonight , isn &apos;t it , emily ?
while i adore performance art ,
why don &apos;t you just get on with it ?
i received a call from the hospital today ,
asking me to come back for an mri ,
which confirmed ... a shocking discovery .
i &apos;ve been misdiagnosed .
and i do not , nor have i ever
suffered from huntington &apos;s disease .
what ?
how did they explain the symptoms ?
seems they were brought on by stress
and the huntington &apos;s medication itself .
i realize now what father paul meant when he said
that he &apos;d been brought back into my life
through divine intervention .
i mean , he was god &apos;s vessel to show me
that i &apos;m meant to live a long and meaningful existence here on earth .
and father paul is now doubtless in heaven ,
having earned his wings .
well , maybe he &apos;s laughing at you
because you had to step down as governor for naught .
i know i certainly am .
well , being governor
merely distracted me from my true destiny--
leading this family . and so the first step
is reclaiming my rightful position
as master of this house .
you must be happy .
your father &apos;s misdiagnosis means you &apos;re in the clear , too .
we &apos;re gonna have one of those in a few weeks .
you sure you want it ?
you questioned the type of man i am
in print ... and to my face .
sorry i questioned you .
if i had a family ,
i &apos;d do anything to protect them .
daniel , i want nothing more than to marry you .
why ?
i don &apos;t think you ever told me why .
because i love you .
now come on . let &apos;s go home .
i &apos;m gonna stay at the southfork again , okay ?
daniel .
see you tomorrow .
where &apos;d you say you found my wallet again ?
well , i went back to the beach club
after i saw you there in hopes that
i &apos;d bump into you again .
no bump , but , uh , your wallet was there .
lucky you , that i found it .
why were you looking for me ?
maybe ... because you intrigue me .
victoria &apos;s mysterious son .
what on earth is he up to in the hamptons ?
and ... why is he always in such a rush to leave ?
what did you find out ?
something that made me happy you stayed .
that was a bit presumptuous .
look , i &apos;m , uh ... i @-@ i &apos;m sorry .
i just thought , you know , you showed up at my party ,
and we saw each other at the beach club ,
that maybe we , uh ...
we did .
have mercy .
how about just a glass of wine ?
yeah ... that , too .
so ?
well , you &apos;re not in any danger .
conrad realized that he &apos;s not sick ,
and now he thinks he beat god .
i guess there &apos;s no beating him .
emily ? what are you doing here ?
i wanted to make sure you got the news
about your father .
he mentioned that you haven &apos;t called him back .
yeah , daniel already told me . he didn &apos;t let you know ?
uh , he &apos;s still staying at the southfork , so ...
i finished with your wedding invitations .
though you &apos;ll probably want to save postage on one .
here you go , jack .
so much for your break from emily thorne .
good night .
night .
i can &apos;t believe you &apos;re still going through with this .
jack .
what are you ...
you &apos;re planning on taking them down at your wedding .
i don &apos;t want you to be there .
i deserve to be there .
i want to be there when they get what &apos;s coming to them .
no , you don &apos;t .
go back to your life , jack ... to carl .
you don &apos;t belong in this .
you know , i don &apos;t believe i &apos;ve properly
congratulated you on your new amusement .
well , it &apos;s more than you &apos;re doing ,
and it &apos;s my ticket to freedom from you .
so get out . i &apos;ve got a lot of work to do .
there &apos;s that spunk i fell in love with .
and i will leave just as soon as you
describe to me mr. mathis &apos; exit plan .
so you have until breakfast to remove him ,
or ... i &apos;ll do it my way .
now that would be unwise .
aiden may be the only hope we have
of stopping daniel from marrying emily .
it seems that she has some inexplicable weakness for him .
god , are you still chewing that same bone , woman ?
use that tenacity to get him out of my pool house .
you may want to rethink that idea .
i looked into your accident .
and why was it your concern ?
because i don &apos;t like you . and i thought maybe
you &apos;d intentionally harmed that priest ,
but i discovered something far more surprising .
somebody tried to kill you by tampering with your brakes .
and i have good reason to believe
it &apos;s someone you know well .
and i imagine i &apos;m looking straight at him .
no , conrad .
jack porter wants you dead .
