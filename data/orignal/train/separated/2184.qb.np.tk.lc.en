the american dream .
everybody &apos;s chasing it .
some find it .
most don &apos;t .
and then there &apos;s the unlucky few who die trying .
this girl was one of those .
but she wasn &apos;t just anyone .
she had people who loved her ,
who cared for her , people who would want answers .
please ,
don &apos;t .
i won &apos;t tell anyone , i promise .

why ? just to be force @-@ fed more misinformation ?
it can wait .
ani and i have more important things to worry about .
this new gig i applied for requires programming skills ,
and i know nothing about programming .
well , maybe that means you &apos;re not the right man for the job .
that &apos;s the problem .
i &apos;m not the right man for any job .
and since my mom took off to maui ,
i figure i need at least 50k a year to move out of this place
and get my own .
oh , and i need a small loan .
just 20 bucks to pay said i.t. consultant .
the financials that we discussed are non @-@ negotiable , jerry .
don &apos;t worry .
chin &apos;s good for it .
or maybe i just call your parents
and let them know you &apos;re ditching school .
shrewd negotiator .
good luck , jerry .
well , i got to jet anyways .
oh , listen . if inotech calls ,
i was a coder at your company for seven years .
what company ?
your global import @-@ export business .
by the way , you &apos;re incredibly successful .
come on , big guy .
that the best you got ?
better ?
it &apos;s good ,
but your hips are telegraphing your jab .
is that right ?
told you .
nice hook .
did you learn that in law school ?
actually , i was club boxing champ
my junior year of college .
that right hook came in handy with the boys .
oh , yeah ?
lucky me , saved by the bell .
let &apos;s say we get some water , mayweather ?
so you ever gonna give me an answer ?
about your friend ?
yeah .
not gonna let that go , are you ?
no . no , i &apos;m not . no ?
i &apos;m telling you , you and jess are perfect for each other .
there &apos;s no such thing , ellie .
come on , her favorite movie is guns of navarone ,
she supports the second amendment ,
and she spends her weekends surfing .
not to mention that she &apos;s drop @-@ dead gorgeous .
drop @-@ dead gorgeous ?
yeah .
i never saw the guns of navarone .
come on , steve , say yes . it &apos;ll be good for you .
look , i really appreciate what you &apos;re trying to do , okay ?
but right now , i @-@ i &apos;m just taking my time .
excuse me .
yeah ?
oh , no , no , no , no .
i cannot let you be set up , okay ?
i got two words for you : patty fitzgerald .
who &apos;s patty fitzgerald ?
patty fitzgerald is someone that my aunt set me up with
when i was 19 years old , okay ?
i was single , i was young .
i figured why not ?
big mistake ?
it was a colossal mistake .
what happened ?
trust me , you do not want to know .
hey , dr. shaw .
gentlemen .
you okay ?
uh , yeah , i &apos;m fine .
dr. bergman &apos;s waiting for you guys inside .
i &apos;ll be there in just a minute .
please , i &apos;ll join you guys in a moment .
okay .
what &apos;s wrong with dr. shaw ?
i don &apos;t know . she appeared to be upset
after we concluded the autopsy on our victim .
did she say why ?
i chose not to pry , but she is still a trainee ,
and in our profession ,
seeing the worst of humanity every day
can take a toll on you .
all right , what do we know about her ?
our victim is brooke waiakea .
22 years old ,
and she was found in a marinepod earlier this morning .
what &apos;s a marinepod ?
it &apos;s a unique containment system for marine aquaculture ,
designed for rough ocean conditions
and a diversity of species .
i can take it from here , dr. bergman .
are you sure ?
yes , thanks .
it &apos;s likely our victim was in the water for roughly six hours .
i put her time of death around midnight .
c.o.d. was a single gunshot wound to the head .
okay .
looks like some powder burn around the entry point there .
close @-@ contact wound .
that &apos;s right .
you find any other trauma ?
nothing , and no defensive wounds .
so she was executed .
yeah , duke , what &apos;s up ?
all right , thank you . thanks .
looks like pier 54 recovered brooke &apos;s car .
csu sent it over to hpd impound for processing .
thank you .
all right , let us know if you find anything else .
will do .
that &apos;s the one right there .
danny , here .
hey , five @-@ o !
show me your hands . hands .
turn around slow , keep your hands up .
morning , fellas .
stay right there .
gps tracker .
i can explain that .
got a piece .
smith &amp; wesson 36 .
well , i can explain that , too .
i &apos;m all ears .
you find yourself in a room
with four walls and no windows .
you &apos;ve either committed a crime or know something about one .
if you &apos;re guilty , you might as well come clean ,
because the man will sweat it out of you .
but if you &apos;re innocent
and you know something they don &apos;t ,
well , that &apos;s a different story .
there you are .
i was starting to get lonely .
we ran your prints .
your name &apos;s harry brown .
30 years with the hpd , huh ?
you had a hell of a career , too ; highly decorated officer .
and if i might add , poker buddies with your old man .
why didn &apos;t you just tell us who you were ?
i figured , under the circumstance ,
we &apos;d end up here anyway .
besides , i missed the place .
we also know you &apos;re a p.i. licensed to carry .
told you i could explain the heater .
it also explains why
you were trespassing in hpd impound .
you were illegally tracking brooke , weren &apos;t you ?
also , you knew the gps would lead back to you .
i couldn &apos;t just leave it there .
who , uh ...
who hired you to follow brooke ?
no one . i was doing it as a favor for her father .
an old coast guard buddy of mine from way back when .
he lives on lana &apos;i .
about six moths ago ,
his only daughter packed her bags and moved to oahu ,
pursue big city dreams .
at first , it was copacetic .
they talked every day .
well , as soon as the calls started to dwindle
and the father asked why ,
you know , she got cagey .
all right , so you figured you &apos;d do your coast guard buddy
a favor and come out here and check it out ?
well , i woke up this morning ,
i saw that the gps signal was coming from the police impound .
i knew something was wrong .
and you thought you &apos;d get the information off the gps ,
locate brooke &apos;s killer and deal with it yourself .
more or less .
but i would &apos;ve left them breathing .
okay , why did brooke stop calling home ?
my guess is she was ashamed .
of what ?
she got herself a job as a dancer at a local hula company .
sounds innocent enough ,
except for the part that it &apos;s a front for an escort service .
call vice . see if they got anything on that .
they do . they &apos;re running a joint investigation
right now with the p.a. &apos; s office .
so far , they haven &apos;t been able to build a case .
all right , explain something to me , harry .
if you knew all this was going on ,
why didn &apos;t you pull brooke out ?
who said i didn &apos;t try ?
she was a tough kid , just like her old man .
she told me she could take care of herself .
and like a jackass , i believed her .
i should &apos;ve never let her out of my sight ,
because now i got to call her father
and tell him that his baby girl
was murdered on my watch .
aloha .
i &apos;m brooke waiakea .
i &apos;m 22 years old ,
and i grew up on the beautiful island of lanai ,
dreaming of becoming a hula dancer .
and now i get to share that dream with you .
so come check us out .
so what do we know about the manoa hula company ?
well , on the surface , everything appears to be kosher .
they hire these dancers for private events ,
corporate outings , graduation parties , etcetera .
but according to the p.a. &apos; s office ,
the clients who are in the know go to the web site ,
where all the dancers have a profile page
just like the one we saw .
it &apos;s like a menu .
you pick the dancer you want ,
you call up the hula manager ,
she sets the whole thing up for you .
so i ran the gps that your man harry planted on our vic &apos;s car .
it shows that she left her place around 2 : 00 a.m.
and went to pier 54 .
which would be impossible ,
since dr. shaw puts t.o.d. right around midnight .
so the killer was driving her car .
that &apos;s what i thought , too , so i had csu
do one last sweep of her car ,
looking for any fingerprint or dna evidence .
they came up empty .
so i &apos;m having them canvass all the boats in the marina
and check video surveillance .
yeah , but why dump brooke in the marinepod
when you got the whole pacific ocean out there ?
marinepod guarantees that she &apos;ll be found .
that &apos;s what our killer wanted .
have you gotten in touch with brooke &apos;s father ?
they &apos;re extremely close . he &apos;s going to be devastated .
yeah , we &apos;re , reaching out to him now .
ms. thompson ,
when was the last time you saw brooke ?
it was last night .
we had a corporate event at the modern .
okay , we &apos;re going to need a list of everybody who was there .
of course .
do you know if brooke
took any work home with her last night ?
excuse me ?
ms. thompson , we know
your company &apos;s under investigation .
that is nothing more
than jealous competitors trying to slander my name .
so you &apos;re saying that your dancers ,
they never have relationships with clients outside of work ?
i did not say that .
my dancers are beautiful women .
if a client calls asking to meet one of them ,
i am not above making an introduction .
yeah , of course not .
matchmaking has been around for thousands of years , gentlemen .
it &apos;s an ancient tradition
that kings and queens used to set up their children .
there &apos;s no money exchanged .
nothing illegal about it .
but you do charge four times more
than your competitors , right ?
quality comes with a price .
yeah , well , so does being an accessory to murder , okay ?
so you &apos;re either gonna tell us
who brooke went home with last night ,
or we &apos;re gonna book you right now
for withholding evidence .
david waring .
he &apos;s been a client for about a year .
after the event ... brooke went out with him .
okay .
has he ever been rough with any of your girls ?
no . never .
okay , well , last night ,
it looks like he made an exception to that .
okay , so the neighbors didn &apos;t hear or see anything .
what about in here ?
take a look .
looks like brooke was going somewhere .
okay , so maybe she knew she was in danger
and decided to leave town .
hey ! this is my apartment .
i want to know what &apos;s going on .
why are the police here ? what happened ?
excuse me .
why won &apos;t you tell me anything ?
who are you ?
i &apos;m annie , brooke &apos;s roommate .
what &apos;s going on ? where is she ?
i left the party before brooke .
stayed out all night .
when i got up this morning ,
i saw some missed calls from her , but ...
i didn &apos;t think anything was wrong .
we know that brooke left the party
with a man named david waring .
do you know him ?
no .
we know all about the company you work for .
it &apos;s important for you to cooperate with us .
you need to tell us what you know .
it &apos;s not what people think .
we don &apos;t have to do anything we don &apos;t want to .
rich men just like to buy us gifts ,
trips , dinners ...
rich men like david waring ?
and in return , you sleep with them .
it &apos;s not just about sex .
some are just lonely and they want company .
and brooke never slept with any of them .
i know how it sounds ,
but brooke wasn &apos;t like that .
she just went out with the clients to keep her job .
if things started moving too fast ,
she &apos;d just ... back off .
well , maybe waring didn &apos;t think he was getting his money &apos;s worth .
i &apos;ve been out with david .
he &apos;s not the aggressive type .
but i know who is .
a man named cory kaniaupio .
he and brooke dated for a few years .
he even asked her to marry him , but she said no .
she didn &apos;t want to settle before
she had a chance to live out her dreams .
that &apos;s why she moved to oahu to be a dancer .
i suppose cory didn &apos;t take that well .
he showed up a few days ago from lanai .
he just kept calling brooke
and leaving messages and texts , and ...
he came over the other night and he was really pissed .
he kept telling brooke that she had to leave with him and ...
brooke said she was gonna call the police , so he left .
that &apos;s the last time i saw him .
do you think he heard her and backed off ?
i think he wasn &apos;t gonna take no for an answer .
chin , what &apos;s up ?
you talk to waring yet ?
no , we &apos;re , uh ...
we &apos;re just about to pull up to his house now . why ?
&apos;cause he might not be our guy .
brooke &apos;s ex @-@ boyfriend cory
showed up from lanai a few days ago .
yeah , we think he was following her last night .
he tried to get her to leave town with him ,
but when she refused , he killed her .
hey , this ex @-@ boyfriend--
he about six feet tall , brown hair , surfer @-@ type ?
yeah , how &apos;d you know ?
uh , &apos; cause he just walked out of waring &apos;s house .
hey , cory !
show us your hands .
show me your hands right now !
hands . hands .
what did you do , cory ? huh ?
what did you do ? where &apos;s david ?
danny , stay with him .
all right , get on your knees .
david waring !
david waring ?
david .
steve , you find him ?
is he in there ?
sorta .
do this job long enough ,
you come to understand that there are a lot of reasons
someone gets zipped up in one of those nifty black bags .
and at the top of that list is good old @-@ fashioned love .
when cupid gets it wrong ,
good @-@ byes tend to be messy .
how could you think i &apos;d hurt brooke ?
i loved her .
yeah , you loved her enough
to make sure nobody else could have her .
no .
no , you &apos;re wrong .
who are you anyway ?
you &apos;re not wearing a badge .
yeah , well , not having one
just means i don &apos;t have to worry about losing it .
trust me , all right ?
you don &apos;t want to piss this guy off .
just tell us what happened .
look , i &apos;m not trying to lie to you .
i was following brooke .
i saw her leave the party with some guy
and go back to his house .
i got so angry , i didn &apos;t know what i was gonna do .
figured i &apos;d lost her forever .
so i got as far away from that place as i could .
ducked into a bar in chinatown--
o &apos;toole &apos;s on nu &apos;uanu .
drank until the place closed .
passed out in my car .
yeah , well , that &apos;s a nice story , kid .
only , you left out the part where my new friend here
found you with waring &apos;s blood on your hands .
we know david waring &apos;s family owns the marinepod ,
which is why you dumped brooke &apos;s body there .
to humiliate david , right ? the way he humiliated you .
but that wasn &apos;t enough for you , was it ? you had to kill him .
i swear , i didn &apos;t touch any of them .
i was at the guy &apos;s house this morning
just to tell him to stay away from brooke .
but when he didn &apos;t answer ...
i went inside .
found him on the floor .
he was already dead .
you know what ?
i believe you , kid .
look into a man &apos;s eyes , and they &apos;ll tell you the truth ,
even if he doesn &apos;t want them to .
cory was no murderer .
he was just a lovelorn kid with a busted heart .
csu still hasn &apos;t recovered brooke &apos;s cell phone .
we &apos;re pulling her records right now .
but we did find cory &apos;s .
now , the battery was dead ,
and when we recharged it ,
there was a voice mail from brooke that he hadn &apos;t heard yet .
cory , it &apos;s me .
call me back as soon as you get this .
i need you .
she sounds scared , but not of cory .
what time she leave that message ?
10 : 05 .
and we know she was killed around midnight , right ?
what are you thinking ?
cory just told us he was drinking at o &apos;toole &apos;s ,
in chinatown .
now , if we can place him there in that two @-@ hour window ,
that means he &apos;s telling the truth
and our killer is still out there .
mr. waring was murdered between 9 : 00 and 10 : 00 p.m.
c.o.d. appears to be blunt force trauma .
i didn &apos;t find any defensive wounds ,
which suggests the poor guy never saw it coming .
okay . between 9 : 00 and 10 : 00 ? are you sure about that ?
yeah . why ?
well , uh , &apos; cause that &apos;s two hours
before brooke was killed .
so maybe this guy was the target
and , uh , she was just collateral .
csu find a murder weapon ?
not yet . i &apos;m still analyzing the skull fracture .
but once i &apos;m finished ,
i may be able to determine what it was .
okay . well , let me know .
will do .
all right , nice work .
thank you .
uh , it &apos;s , uh , nice to see that you &apos;re feeling better .
yeah , thanks .
bit of a &quot; my bad &quot; situation this morning .
no , look , uh ... it &apos;s understandable .
i mean , working that close with max
would bring anybody to tears .
see ? look at that . that &apos;s a very nice smile . that &apos;s much better .
bit of an odd one , isn &apos;t he ?
yeah , he is , but that &apos;s , uh ... that &apos;s why we love him .
or at least like him a lot , you know ?
okay , uh , do you mind , uh ,
if i ask you who brooke reminded you of ?
how did you know that ?
well , i , uh ... i &apos;ve had this job
for , uh , way too long , i think .
susan landon .
met on the first day of freshman year .
you know , one of those people you just ...
you just click with right away ?
that was us .
a few days before graduation ,
we were out celebrating and ...
i left this club early because , you know ,
that &apos;s me , but ...
susan never came home .
next morning , they found her in a river
near campus .
police said she drowned ,
but the coroner never found any water in her lungs .
they ever , uh ... they ever find out who did it ?
no .
most days , i @-@ i ...
i don &apos;t let it bother me .
but today i did .
look , uh ...
you know , that &apos;s the tough part about this job .
you know , somebody dies , that &apos;s when we go to work , hmm ?
so how do you deal with it ?
well , i , um ... i got a ... i got a daughter .
you know , a little girl .
and when i , uh ... when i hang out with her ,
i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m able to just put everything off to the side .
everything else , you know ?
surfing . they say surfing is good .
you should try that maybe .
i mean , i don &apos;t understand it personally .
uh , it &apos;s not for me . some sort of an escape .
that &apos;s what you need , i think .
yeah . thank you , detective williams .
yeah , sure .
this guy waring &apos;s got
no criminal record to speak of .
but he wasn &apos;t exactly gonna win
any popularity contests , either .
he was a defendant in multiple lawsuits
involving bad real estate deals .
the guy &apos;s been engaged i don &apos;t know how many times
over the last three years .
the latest prize winner is
the lovely ms. erica young .
okay , we need to find her .
maybe she can tell us something about last night .
well , cory &apos;s alibi checks out .
he was at o &apos;toole &apos;s all night .
i also went through brooke &apos;s cell phone records .
the last call she made was to a cab company ,
who told me that they picked her up
from waring &apos;s house at 10 : 15
and drove her home .
that means she was there when waring was murdered .
so , either the killer didn &apos;t know she was in the house ...
you know , brooke could be the killer .
no , i don &apos;t think so .
when she left that voice mail for cory ,
she was whispering ; she sounded like she was
afraid somebody would hear her .
that could &apos;ve been waring &apos;s killer .
cory , it &apos;s me .
call me back as soon as you get this .
i need you .
wait a minute . you hear that ?
there &apos;s something in the background .
cory , it &apos;s me .
call me back as soon as you get this .
you hear that ?
i need you .
yeah , chin , can you isolate that ?
cory , it &apos;s me .
call me back as soon as you get this .
i need you .
right there . you got it .
call me back as soon as you get this .
call me back as soon as you get this .
it sounds like water dripping .
call me back as soon as you get this .
this is where brooke made the call .
and i &apos;ll tell your wife and daughter
how you &apos;re an even bigger scumbag than i am .
get the hell out of here !
she witnessed the murder .
yeah , and she was killed to cover it up .
wow . that &apos;s , uh ...
that &apos;s nice , gallagher .
oh , i don &apos;t think she , uh ... i don &apos;t think
she knows who gallagher is .
did he work here ?
no , no . he was a comedian in the &apos; 80s ; he used to , uh ,
smash watermelons with a sledgehammer .
and people thought that was funny ?
it was the &apos; 80s .
what &apos;s with him ?
he is a little experiment i conducted .
now , david waring was struck three times
in the parietal bone with a rounded object .
unfortunately , no fragments were found in the wound
to tell us what the murder weapon was .
but i was able to determine one thing about our killer .
their height .
the ladder give it away , i think .
nice detective work , detective .
now , our killer is under six feet .
first blow to waring was fatal ,
which means his attacker would &apos;ve had to come down
with a significant amount of force and from a high angle .
like this .
what is it-- 100 mile @-@ an @-@ hour serve ?
she &apos;s killing that ball .
yeah .
imagine what that could do to your head .
what ?
i just can &apos;t believe this .
we just had lunch with him yesterday afternoon .
he can &apos;t be dead .
okay , uh , do you know anybody
who would want to do something like this to him ?
no .
no , of course not .
okay .
you ever seen this woman before ?
you recognize her ?
who is she ?
her name is brooke waiakea .
she was killed yesterday .
and we have reason to believe that her
and david &apos;s murders are linked .
i don &apos;t understand .
okay , look , there &apos;s no easy way to put this .
um ... we believe that brooke might &apos;ve been an escort
and that david was one of her clients .
i know that he had been with escorts in the past .
erica , what were you thinking ?
he told me that he had stopped , dad . i ...
i knew what kind of man he was .
i thought he had changed .
okay , um ...
i &apos;m sorry to have to ask you this , but , uh ,
where were you last night between 9 : 00 and 2 : 00 a.m. ?
she was having dinner with my wife and i.
she stayed at our house last night .
dad , don &apos;t .
i was home all night .
okay , was anybody with you ?
no .
david had a business dinner .
when he didn &apos;t show up to my place after that ,
i assumed that it ran late and he slept at his place .
listen , i had nothing to do with this .
david wasn &apos;t perfect , but i loved him .
i guess i made myself believe he loved me , too .
can i help you ?
yeah , i hope so .
i was just passing by and i saw your boat .
i think i &apos;ve seen it before over by pier 54 .
she &apos;s not for sale , partner .
i didn &apos;t say i was here to buy .
then what do you want ?
i was down by the harbor last night .
i could swear i saw you launch her ,
what was it , about 2 : 00 a.m. ?
i think you got me confused with somebody else .
now , why don &apos;t you get the hell out of here ?
no .
i think i got the right guy .
give me your arm , scumbag .
thanks for that .
it &apos;s been a long time .
son of a bitch .
guy &apos;s name is richard sheridan .
he &apos;s a stock broker that works out of his home .
we &apos;re still running him through the system .
how the hell did you find him ?
there were tread marks at the entry slip at pier 54,
so i took an imprint .
matched a dodge 1500 .
turns out there are only five dodges
with a permit to launch at the pier .
the wear patterns on the treads
matched the one that belongs to sheridan .
wow , we should give this guy a job .
yeah , no thanks .
after this is over with , i &apos;m going back to retirement .
well , you &apos;ll finish one for one .
csu found traces of blood on the blanket onboard that boat .
dna matches brooke &apos;s .
i want to file a complaint .
this crazy bastard assaulted me .
i &apos;ve been called worse .
listen to me .
we found brooke waiakea &apos;s blood
on your boat , richard .
you &apos;re going away for murder , you understand ?
i didn &apos;t kill anybody . i was home all night .
somebody must &apos;ve jacked my rig , used my boat .
jacked your ... ? you &apos;re saying someone stole your boat ?
that &apos;s what you &apos;re going with ?
that &apos;s the truth , pal .
all right .
i suppose you got somebody to verify that alibi , too ?
i do . my wife .
she was home with me all night .
he &apos;s lying .
give me five minutes with this son of a bitch .
i &apos;m done talking .
i want my lawyer .
all right , tell me we got something on this guy .
no connection to our victims ,
no criminal record .
he had some recent money troubles , bad investments ,
but he seems to have recovered from it .
there &apos;s got to be something connecting this guy
to our victims that we &apos;re not seeing .
you know what ?
david waring was a client of the manoa hula company .
all right ? maybe sheridan was , too .
so , maybe he had a thing for brooke .
wasn &apos;t willing to share her .
we got to get ahold of kiana thompson &apos;s client list .
look , steve .
there &apos;s nothing i would love
more than to see kiana thompson indicted , but she &apos;s got
the best defense attorneys in town covering her ass .
i understand that . all i need is her client list .
well , if it was that easy ,
don &apos;t you think i &apos;d have it already ?
i have a feeling there are some pretty powerful people on it
that don &apos;t want their names getting out .
okay , listen ,
sheridan is a prime suspect in two homicides , right ?
brooke waiakea was a dancer at the manoa hula company ,
and david waring was a client .
that &apos;s got to be enough for a judge to sign off on a warrant .
do you have proof waring was a client ?
yeah , kiana thompson gave us his name .
and brooke &apos;s roommate , she verified their relationship .
well , i &apos;m gonna need cooperation from the roommate .
you &apos;ll get it .
okay , wait here . i &apos;ll call the judge .
mahalo .
chin .
steve , csu found a hair follicle on the blanket
that was used to transport brooke &apos;s body .
now , crime lab analyzed it , and based on its degradation ,
they think it was transferred within the last 24 hours .
it &apos;s a male , and it doesn &apos;t belong to sheridan .
all right , we get any hits in codis ?
no , but i &apos;m guessing
that sheridan wasn &apos;t alone on that boat last night .
that &apos;s why he &apos;s not talking .
he &apos;s protecting somebody .
whoever else was on that boat is our killer .
gentlemen , you can &apos;t go in there .
trust me , your boss knows we &apos;re coming .
i always loved this part--
dropping the hammer on someone
who thinks they got away with murder .
as we move into the first quarter ,
my projections show a 20 percent growth in the industry overall ...
i &apos;m so sorry , mr. young .
i told them you were in a meeting .
it &apos;s okay , stacy .
let &apos;s take half an hour .
gentlemen .
robert .
that was a pretty impressive little act
at the tennis club earlier .
i &apos;m not sure i follow .
you murdered brooke waiakea and david waring .
what is he talking about ?
i &apos;ll tell you what he &apos;s talking about .
the manoa hula company &apos;s client list-- your name was on it .
i hired them for a corporate event .
tell me something , when did you find out
that david waring &apos;s name was also on the same client list ?
&apos;cause i &apos;m thinking it must have been pretty recently .
because there &apos;s no way you would have
let your daughter marry him
once you knew what he was up to , right ?
is that why you went to his place last night ? to confront him ?
there &apos;s nothing worse than a hypocrite .
sure , it &apos;s all right for you to cheat .
but not the man who &apos;s gonna marry your precious little girl .
it is over , you scumbag .
you are gonna call erica ,
and you are gonna break it off or i will !
go ahead .
and i &apos;ll tell your wife and daughter
how you &apos;re an even bigger scumbag than i am .
get the hell out of here !
good luck proving any of this .
luck &apos;s got nothing to do with it .
yeah , he &apos;s right . we got some dna off the blanket
that was used to wrap up brooke .
my guess is it &apos;s gonna be a match to you .
not that we needed it .
the moment we told sheridan
that we knew you were involved , he spilled .
told us that you guys were friends since elementary school .
he told us about you bailing him out
of the recent financial problems he had .
he also told us that when you called him to borrow his boat ,
he felt obligated .
you almost got away with murder .
but you didn &apos;t know brooke was still there , did you ?
eh , it &apos;s all right , i mean , we got a pretty good idea
who tipped you off about her .
if you still have any humanity left in you ,
do yourself a favor and tell us .
that &apos;s what we used to call &quot; incentive . &quot;
i would give him a name if i was you .
hi . you , uh , headed out ?
yeah , i &apos;m headed to a venue .
oh , i don &apos;t think you &apos;re gonna make it .
kiana thompson , you &apos;re under arrest .
for what ?
what , your office couldn &apos;t make a case against me ,
so you bring your bulldogs down here to try and scare me ?
actually , it &apos;s got nothing to do with our case .
yeah , you &apos;re under arrest for conspiracy to commit murder .
i just wanted to be here to see you get taken away .
now , you see , when brooke witnessed david waring &apos;s murder ,
she went home , and she called you .
you told her you were gonna protect her , take care of everything .
but then you called robert young instead .
i mean , i get it , you know .
brooke wasn &apos;t worth losing two clients in one night .
she didn &apos;t have the heart for this work .
she was never gonna last .
come on .
thank you .
jer . what are you doing ?
hey , chin , i got the job .
well , not the job , i got a job .
i &apos;m in advertising now .
seems like you got a real knack for it .
i know . it &apos;s kind of like i was born
with this preternatural ability i never knew i had .
so i guess the programming gig didn &apos;t work out , huh ?
apparently , they never heard of your import / export business .
and since you were my only reference , they decided to pass .
what ? !
and my company was so successful , too .
the upshot is kamekona &apos;s paying me off the books ,
which is good because , you know ,
me and the old irs don &apos;t exactly see eye @-@ to @-@ eye .
plus the hours aren &apos;t bad , and i get 20 % off .
employee perk .
jer , you realize you just admitted to tax evasion , right ?
well , i guess i could quit .
but then i &apos;d probably have to be
moving into your place permanently .
you know what , why don &apos;t you , uh ,
just bring us home a couple plates of coconut shrimp , huh ?
you got it .
oh , and it &apos;s on me .
no , no , no , no .
save your money . i got this one .
how &apos;s brooke &apos;s father doing ?
he lost his little girl .
he &apos;s a mess .
i &apos;m gonna to head with him back to lana &apos;i .
bring brooke back home where she belongs .
listen , harry , this is , uh ...
you can &apos;t blame yourself for this one .
sure , i can .
men like us , we were born to protect and serve .
when somebody dies that we could &apos;ve saved ,
i mean , that doesn &apos;t go away .
listen , i can &apos;t thank you enough for your help on this .
i mean it , harry , i mean , if it wasn &apos;t for you ,
there &apos;s , uh ... there &apos;s no way we would &apos;ve solved it .
i appreciate you saying so .
you know , all this modern technology--
it &apos;s really not my thing .
hey , you could take all the modern technology you want ,
it &apos;s never gonna replace a gut instinct
and good old @-@ fashioned police work .
well , it &apos;s good to know that &apos;s not gonna go out of style .
you &apos;re a good cop , kid .
you remind me a lot of myself .
aloha , steve .
aloha , harry .
no matter what they tell you ,
time doesn &apos;t heal all wounds .
when someone you love is ripped from your life ,
that scar stays with you forever .
but the one bright light in all the darkness
is knowing that men like steve mcgarrett are out there ,
making sure the good guys always come out on top .
