*It's harder than they say*
*To try and settle down
*You see it in her line*
*You look it up and down*
*Somehow you're always there*
*Somehow it's always wrong*
*As far as I can see*
*That much'll never change*
*It's what you always know, just like your name*
*And when it rains, when it rains*
*Oh, the sun comes out again*
*Crown of age, crown of age*
*Just like it's always been*
*Crown of age, crown of age*
*Yes, it's all up to you*
*And when it rains, when it rains*
*Oh, the sun comes out again*
*Crown of age, crown of age*
*Just like it's always been*
*And you know, and you know*
*Oh, what you've gotta do*
*Crown of age, crown of age*
*Yes, it's all up to you*
*Crown of age, crown of age*
*Yes, it's all up to you*
I don't understand.
You're suing the gun manufacturer?
No, we're suing the designer of the 3-D gun
that malfunctioned and crippled our client.
So why would that make you a better State's Attorney?
Actions speak louder than words.
I've been actively pursuing
cases like this on gun control for... years.
You've also defended some pretty bad people, too--
for example, Lemond Bishop.
He's no longer a client.
To your knowledge, has Lemond Bishop contributed
to your campaign or your PAC?
No.
She's lying.
How do you know?
Because she used to represent Bishop.
And you're giving her a free ride this saint crap.
Uh, M-Martin, I benefit just as much as she does from...
Frank, she got the endorsement.
She lied, and she got the newspaper's endorsement.
That's a three-point bump three days before the election.
So set up more events.
I'm here; I'm ready.
Is this another "Come to Jesus" Moment?
'Cause I don't know how many more of these i can take, Martin.
Look, I like you, Frank.
You're a good man, possibly even a great one,
and I will do everything I can to help you win...
but you are too nice.
She's a liar. She told them...
exactly what they wanted to hear,
and I'll bet you every dollar I have
they knew she was lying, they wanted her to lie--
because people respect someone who's willing
to lie for what they believe in.
It shows strength.
They don't respect the truth.
Every time you said something self-deprecatingly true
to that editorial board, they all patted you on the back
and then snickered behind their hands.
I won't smear her.
That's always what this comes down to.
I won't go against my principles.
You disagree with her?
Yes, on policy.
You disagree with her husband?
Yes.
There.
Don't go after her; go after him.
I'm not running against her husband.
Exactly, so there's no problem going after him.
He was corrupt.
What will going after her husband do?
It will show what you're against.
Campaigns aren't just about what you're for.
They're about what you're against.
So go after the husband.
For the, uh, uh...
I'm not leaving you in a lurch;
will you stop saying that?
Blah, blah, or whatever.
Please? Oh, so the whole...
What's going on?
Nothing. We're...
We've got a problem.
We can see that.
Tell her the problem, Jon.
Okay.
Uh, the first thing I'll do is clean house
and take a look at hiring
going back to Peter Florrick's administra--
So our tracker just picked this up outside the hotel.
What's wrong with it?
Peter Florrick brought a new level of cronyism to the office,
and that's what I'll need to root out.
Uh, the office needs an upheaval,
not the partial measures of Mr. Florrick.
Okay, so he mentions Peter eight times
in the space of whatever, a short time.
He's coming after you through your husband.
That's his way of getting around your,
you know, little thing.
Your agreement to not go negative.
So, what do I do, defend Peter?
No, that's exactly what they want.
I think the time has come
for you to separate yourself.
You need your Sister Soulja moment.
指大胆抨击同阵营的极端人物的时间
So I should criticize Peter?
Yes, his issues.
What issues?
Doesn't matter, pick one.
God, this is like high school.
The key is to create a little space
between you and Peter.
That way, Prady can say whatever he wants,
and none of it will land on you.
And what's the con?
The con?
Why wouldn't I do this?
The two of you were arguing before.
Who's against it?
No.
No, that's not what we were arguing about.
Tell her, big man.
I've been asked to join a campaign
in Sacramento on the 7th.
The 7th of...?
This month,
Election Day, but don't worry.
You are in great shape.
There's not really anything to be done
on the campaign at that point.
And this being Chicago, you know,
there's never any fraud at the polls.
Come on, Josh. That's not fair.
We've got lawyers for exactly that kind of thing.
Alicia...
How's he doing on the stand?
What?
McVeigh, how's he doing on the stand?
Oh, I don't know, I haven't checked in.
That's not why I'm calling.
Louis Canning called you.
What? Why?
Uh, he wants to see you.
He's in ICU, but we think it's a good idea.
We? What do you mean?
We think it's a good idea
for you to go and see him and get him to sign off
on his lawsuit against us.
While he's in the ICU?
Yes.
You want me to pull an Ashcroft.
Get him to sign something when he's weak in the hospital?
No, but you're going to the hospital anyway,
so it would be good for the firm
if he accepted our reasonable offer.
Look, just call me when you find out
how McVeigh's doing on the stand, okay?
The firearm was devised through additive manufacturing,
or as it's more popularly known, 3-D printing.
And it works from software?
Yes, open source file.
So if I type in the words,
uh, "3-D printer gun" right now,
it would come up with a file just like that?
Yes, uh, Mr. Fife's design
is still currently on his Web site.
So, once you've downloaded
all the schematics for the gun,
how difficult is it to print one?
Load a spool of plastic into a 3-D printer,
push "Print."
That's it?
Yes, that's it.
Well, dear God, that's appalling.
I mean, how long does it take to print?
A gun, Your Honor?
Approximately four hours.
So, on January the 17...
And this gun, it fires actual bullets?
Yes, Your Honor.
And it's plastic,
so you could get it through a, uh, metal detector.
Yes, Your Honor.
Well, thank God for the Second Amendment.
Well, Your Honor, this technology has more
to do with the First Amendment than the Second.
No, no. Not if the software can kill.
Yes, but it's not the software that's killing.
Your Honor, if we could show you what happened next?
Yeah, yeah, of course. My apologies.
Um, and I promise I won't let my bias impact my decision.
Thank you, Your Honor.
You've always been very fair,
so we're counting on that.
So, Mr. McVeigh, this is the gun that was taken
to the Cantata Vega Shooting Range?
Is that correct?
Yes.
And what happened at that range?
The gun misfired
and sent shrapnel through an alley partition
and injured the spine of Mr. Summerfeldt.
So the misfire that paralyzed my client was foreseeable?
Yes, by someone with experience in printing
and testing 3-D printed guns.
And the shooter, Carsten Pope, did he have that experience?
No, he had never printed
nor fired a gun like that before.
So who should've known?
The gun designer, Mr. Fife.
He is the expert here, he made the gun
readily available to the public. The responsibility is his.
Thank you, Mr. McVeigh. Nothing further, Your Honor.
He's a good witness.
Mr. McVeigh, how are you?
I'm good, thank you.
Good. Thank you very much
for taking us all through this technology.
It just seems to get more and more complicated,
doesn't it?
Oh, yeah, it does.
And culpability, then, gets more and more complicated,
because it goes through so many different hands.
Objection, Your Honor.
Ms. Crozier seems to be confused
as to who is on the witness stand.
No.
I'm just plain confused.
It's not like there's one manufacturer and one...
Your Honor?
Yeah, um...
Sustained. Is anybody else
really disturbed by all this?
Okay, okay, thank you.
That was rhetorical.
Um, no more editorial content from me.
Ms. Crozier?
Thank you, Your Honor.
So, Mr. McVeigh,
The shooter, Mr. Pope,
sitting right there, you're not suing him, Right?
Actually, I'm not suing anyone, Ms. Crozier.
You're just an expert witness
who happens to be married
to one of the plaintiff's attorneys.
Sorry, let me rephrase that.
The shooter, Mr. Pope,
the one that your wife is not suing,
he built the gun
that injured Eddie Summerfeldt.
No.
No. No?
He didn't?
He didn't build it.
He printed it.
But you said that he didn't have any training in 3-D printing.
That's correct.
Do you know where he made...
or printed, the gun?
In his garage.
And he spent $25?
God help us.
$22.50
in materials,
and $1,795 for the printer.
Well, I mean, i don't know much about guns.
You're the expert there,
but I'm still just trying to figure out why it is
you're suing my client,
who's merely responsible for the design of the thing,
and not the shooter, who actually printed
and fired the gun.
Again, ma'am, I'm not suing anyone.
Well, maybe you could just convince your wife...
Objection, Your Honor.
I'll sustain that.
I just, I-I, I just can't believe it.
Twenty-five dollars.
How is it that you make me feel like I'm 22?
How are you, Mr. Canning?
I'm alive.
But you got a new kidney.
Yes.
Sit, sit there.
So, were you elected?
No.
Oh, you lost.
No, it's just three days away.
I voted absentee.
Thank you.
No, against you.
So, Mr. Canning, if you don't mind...
This girl, this 13-year-old girl,
went to head a soccer ball at her junior league game,
and, uh, her head
hit another girl's head,
and she died.
She just...
dropped to the field, dead.
And I don't even know her name.
But she gave me a kidney.
Can you believe that?
I can.
So, I swore to myself before I went into surgery
that I'd do something for her.
If it worked out, if-if it went well,
and I lived that I would do something good.
For her family?
Yes.
I want to liquidate my stocks.
$18 million.
Give them to her family.
Will you do that for me?
Have you called your estate lawyer?
Yes, he's not returning my calls.
Think he wants to wait till I'm dead, and then...
keep all the money in-house.
Who is your estate attorney?
David Lee.
I didn't put the file up to hurt people.
I put it up to protect them.
That you'll have to explain, Mr. Fife.
You wanted to protect my client
by providing schematics for guns
that are undetectable, untraceable and unregulated?
Yeah, and uncensorable.
So, this is all about the First Amendment to you?
Yes. Yes, Your Honor.
I-I have the First Amendment right
to put out whatever information I want,
no matter how many laws are passed
to limit my rights under the Second.
Did you consider posting a warning?
And you don't worry
about what crazy person might use your design?
Sure, I do, but I worry more
about what crazy person will become the next dictator.
And-and what do dictators confiscate
even before the printing presses? The guns.
All right, let's move on to...
Um, Your Honor,
may Mr. Fife finish the answer?
Yes, he may.
3-D technology has made it impossible
for dictators to control firearms.
I can e-mail a gun to any person
in the world in seconds.
A rebel fighter in Syria,
a dissident in China,
a freedom fighter in Pakistan.
This machine has made democracy possible worldwide.
It is the modern version
of the printing press.
Look, I was watching him, okay, Diane.
He's still on our side.
I don't know.
Judge Abernathy ends up feeling so guilty about his bias,
he sometimes rules against it.
Well, that's harder to do when the defendant is crazy.
We didn't make him crazy enough?
Yeah. Let me.
You're not returning Canning's calls.
Actually, I am.
David, I just came from him.
He gave me power of attorney
to liquidate all his stocks
and give all $18 million to the family of the donor.
Okay.
David...
he wants it done now.
Do you know the donor's family?
No, but I'm sure you can get it from the hospital.
I did get it from the hospital.
The Farsouns-- Izzat and Helga.
Their daughter's name was Leila.
Okay.
Did you contact them?
I did.
David, if you're waiting for Mr. Canning to die,
I will bring you up on charges...
They don't want the money for themselves.
They want to send it to a charity.
"The Strong Arm of Liberty."
Strong Arm of Liberty support
the oppressed peoples of Palestine.
You can't let your political bias impact your representation.
It's Canning's choice.
And I'll facilitate his choice
after I get full indemnification,
including a letter from the State Department
saying this group is kosher.
Appropriate.
It's not illegal to give to pro-Palestinian causes.
It is if they support Hamas.
Do they support Hamas?
It's too new for the State Department to make a determination.
And I'm not spending ten years
in a federal prison for aiding and abetting terrorists.
Okay.
Let me talk to Canning,
see if he wants to do other good works.
Yes.
Maybe he can find other ways of facilitating the killing of Jews.
Hello again, Mr. Fife.
Hello back at you.
Now, you made your firearm software open source
for a very good reason, isn't that right, Mr. Fife?
You wanted to make it available to... well, everyone.
Yeah, everyone with a 3-D printer.
Even felons?
Yes, if they could...
Objection, Your Honor. Relevance.
The defense opened the door.
They argued their Constitutional rights shielded them from culpability.
We merely want to explore that right.
Yes, seems fair to me.
Overruled.
You were saying, Mr. Fife?
I just saw Ms. Crozier
making a signal to you, Mr. Fife.
Would you care to explain?
Oh, no, I didn't.
Well, I saw you making what I would interpret
to be a "Go-easy" gesture.
No, Your Honor, I simp...
I was feeling heat coming from somewhere under...
I don't know if there's a vent.
Okay, okay.
Okay, then, let's-let's all stop gesturing.
Mr. Fife seems perfectly capable of taking care of himself.
Mr. Fife.
Yeah, yes.
If a felon could afford a 3-D printer,
uh, he would have access to my software.
And children?
Would you make it available to children?
It is available to children,
as is porn, and-and Kim Kardashian's ass,
unless parents put parental control on their computers.
In fact, weren't you quoted as saying,
"I can't wait for the first school shooting
with a 3-D gun.
Objection, Your Honor. Argumentative.
I'm just using his own words, Your Honor.
Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait, wait, wait wait, wait, wait, wait.
Mr. Fife, are these your own words?
Uh, if it was taken from an interview on Noisy, yes.
But they're always taken out of context.
Well, I'm sorry. Please.
Supply the context.
It...
I said, "I can't wait for the first shooting
with a 3-D gun,
"'cause then we'll see how the government tries
to suppress the printing press."
It was an intellectual argument.
Yeah, except you said, "School shooting."
Yes. I wa... I was... I was just being provocative.
I-I was, I was trying to draw attention to the issues.
I would phrase it differently now, Your Honor.
Good to know.
$200,000.
Oh, come on, Nancy.
Let me take it to my client.
If he's the good cop, but she's the bad one,
what does that make you two?
Give us time to talk to our client.
Come on. Be honest. The only reason that you're not
going after the shooter is because he's broke.
And it wasn't his fault.
We'll present the offer
and get back to you.
Okay.
Okay.
Well, I'm advising Eddie to take it.
That would be a mistake. Crozier is on the run.
She has a jackass for a client
and Abernathy on the bench.
Yes, and $200,000 is double what my client expected.
Our client.
The client that I brought to you.
For our judgment.
Yeah, for your judgment, yeah,
but not for you politics.
What does that mean?
This case is about a young father
confined to a wheelchair for the rest of his life.
It's not about gun control.
It's also not about the quick fees you can make from $200,000.
Still got some hard feelings there, Cary?
You mean from you trying to put me in jail for 15 years?
No, no. That's ancient history.
Okay, okay, let's just take a breath.
Let's ask the client what he wants.
When did the 2:30 tomorrow get moved
to the Black Business Leaders Lunch?
She was supposed to be doing the Rotary, but wha...?
Why did they get moved?
I don't know.
When did it get moved?
An hour ago?
What happened an hour ago?
I don't know.
Why the Black Business Leaders?
Prady's doing a speech there, too, so...
It's about Peter.
It's about Prady criticizing Peter.
I'm thinking of getting a tramp stamp.
What do you think?
She's not defending him, is she?
She's throwing Peter under the bus.
It's about his black hiring practices.
I have to go, Dad. Take care.
Marissa, get back in here!
Rebecca Smercornish. I'm a ballistics
and modern trajectory expert with the SAA.
So, you're sure you want to keep going?
...I had a joint Justice Department ATF working group
looking into regulating 3D firearms.
Did you happen to study under Mr. McVeigh,
the plaintiff's ballistics expert?
I did.
And do you have an opinion
about the testimony that he's given this afternoon?
I do.
Mr. McVeigh is an excellent ballistics expert,
but I'm afraid he's a bit...
old school.
He specializes in trajectory analysis
and gunshot residue on any weapon
produced in the last 100 years.
But not wiki weapons.
And when you examined the gun at issue in this case,
did you notice anything unusual?
I did.
Uh... may I?
I must admit, I worry about turning this trial into a clinic
on gun-making, but... yeah, please.
The CAD specs provided by Mr. Fife
are for his preferred version of the firearm.
But given that the file is open source,
it's easy for a user to tweak the design
to his or her taste.
Can you give us an example?
Sure.
Imagine you have small hands, like I do.
You just make an adjustment to the program,
and voil- custom grip.
And you can do that to any part of the gun, easily.
Did Mr. Pope make any adjustments?
Yes, he shortened the barrel.
Not a lot.
By less than a 16th of an inch, to 3.43.
I'm certain that's why Mr. McVeigh didn't catch it.
And could such a tweak
have contributed to the gun misfiring?
Yes.
But could the designer of the gun-- Mr. Fife--
have done anything about this?
Could he have prevented Mr. Pope from making such a tweak?
No.
The gun Mr. Pope brought to the firing range
was the one he made, with his own tweaks,
for which he is responsible.
Mr. Pope is really the person who should be sued here.
But you can also change the way a printer prints, is that right?
Yeah, it is.
The quality of plastic you use makes a big difference, too.
As does your infill setting...
Right.
We're finding, on the new... - Hello.
May I have our Mr. McVeigh for a moment?
Yes.
Definitely.
Congratulations, by the way.
I heard you tied the knot.
We did. Thanks.
This is not an intellectual exercise.
We're here to win, dear.
Actually, you're here to win.
I'm here to testify.
For us.
If they know you have doubts,
they'll put you back on the stand to exploit them.
Where are you going?
To assuage my doubts.
So, the Black Business Leaders.
It's a good venue.
It's a very good venue to trash Peter.
Do I need to be here for this?
Yes. You're supposed to be the adult here.
When he goes off on one of his crusades, you steer.
I am steering.
It's the smart move, and if you were here,
instead of off doing, uh, uh...
Peter is finally making traction with black voters
and you're gonna screw it up.
That's not our problem.
Yes, it is your problem.
You need Peter.
You need the Governor.
There are three days left in the campaign, Eli.
We needed the governor.
We don't now.
We're up by three.
You may not want Peter as a friend,
but you certainly don't want him as an enemy.
Oh-oh, what's that mean?
It doesn't mean anything.
The governor's not going to come out against his own wife.
Josh, why don't you give us a minute?
Sure.
Always a pleasure, Eli.
I got you that job in California.
You did not get me the job in California.
You made a phone call.
And I can withdraw that call.
It's the kind of job that could make someone's reputation.
So you're gonna bad-mouth me
unless I pull back on the Black Business Leaders?
Oh, yes.
It's your choice, Jon.
You want that job,
you tell Alicia it's a bad idea to trash Peter,
because it is a bad idea to trash Peter.
You don't need it, this late in the campaign.
You know you don't.
This is an exact replica of the 3-D gun that Carsten Pope fired.
Including the tweak.
So this gun should match the gun that injured my client?
Yes. It was also printed on Pope's printer.
You want to do the honors?
Mm.
Just enough to pull the trigger.
Ready?
Kurt, is that good?
Maybe. I believe that we're getting catastrophic failure
from these guns because the 3-D printer was false feeding.
False feeding?
Yeah. I noticed that the printer was stuttering sometimes,
when it was pulling the plastic filament off the spool.
Now, it resulted in some layers being skipped,
making the barrel too weak in some places
to contain the explosion when a bullet's fired.
But... is that the designer's fault?
No.
I'll need to get a different printer
and test Fife's design with and without the tweak.
But it'll take some time.
Uh, but as of now?
My expert opinion is... the printer's to blame.
So you think I have the wrong defendant?
Yes.
My husband was a good State's Attorney.
But he made some mistakes.
Some were front page news.
Others weren't.
There's this saying...
There's this saying...
You're early. I thought we said 1:00.
We did.
But I was thinking about the Black Business Leaders speech.
Oh, yes. I was just working on it now.
Well, I... I'm having second thoughts.
I think it's a mistake to throw Peter under the bus.
You do?
I do. I'm worried about you losing more votes
than you'd gain... old-time supporters of his, Christians.
We've hitched our wagon to Peter from the beginning.
I'm worried that we might end up looking like opportunists.
But what about countering Prady's attack?
I looked at the overnights--
the attack doesn't seem to leave much of a mark.
I'm thinking we play to our base.
You sure?
Yes.
For better or for worse, you guys are a brand.
You're the Florricks. A package deal.
This is the first speech.
It'll be on the teleprompters.
Okay.
Okay. I'll see you at 1:00.
Why are you leaving Election Day?
This job in Sacramento. It's a special election.
They... they're in trouble.
So it's not because of me. Of us.
No.
Okay.
Okay.
What's this?
I don't know. It's too far away.
What is it?
You amended the suit.
Oh, yes, we did. Based on your test.
We're suing the maker of the printer.
But you're still suing Chris Fife,
even though his design isn't the problem.
Fife's web site links to the faulty printer.
He specifically advocates its use,
so we're able to backdoor him.
You don't believe that he is legally negligent.
You just think he's politically offensive.
I think he's both.
He's making it possible for anyone to make
an untraceable, untrackable gun.
Who do you think will use it?
That's not a question for lawyers.
That's for politicians. You want to run? Run.
We need you to testify, Kurt.
I need you to testify.
No.
Not for a crusade.
You can talk to him.
Oh, that's all right.
It helps.
Squeeze his hand and talk to him.
So...
I'm here because I need to know
what you want me to do with your money, Mr. Canning.
This family, they want to give it to a Palestinian charity,
but it might have illegal ties...
She probably means talk about something personal.
My daughter's praying for you, so that's good.
I'm not. Because that would be hypocritical.
I don't want you to die, Mr. Canning, okay?
I know you're a bad man, but...
I sort of miss you.
I know. That's weird.
I don't know why.
I seem to have some...
bad boy issues.
Get well, Mr. Canning.
Okay.
I am gonna get your money to that charity.
Bye.
You're a real dirtbag,
you know that?
No, I didn't know that.
You're letting my dad bully you.
Marissa, you don't know what you're talking about.
He threatened to yank your next job
unless you advised Alicia to back down.
Alicia and Peter are better off standing together.
They're a package deal.
Package deal.
Yeah, I heard my dad say it already, dirtbag.
Well, then Marissa, why don't you leave me alone, okay?
Your job is to give her ChapStick and breath mints,
not bust my balls.
God, handsome men are so weak.
Kurt McVeigh?
Yeah?
You've been served.
Who's it from?
Diane Lockhart.
So you used the same BlockStock 3-D printer to make your gun
as Carsten Pope did?
Yes.
And would you characterize it
as a smooth process?
I have nothing to compare it to.
I think your, uh,
witness would appreciate some specificity.
Let me rephrase.
Did you find that when you were making the gun...
the printer stuttered?
Yes.
Were you able to determine why?
There was too much friction in the feed tube.
And what effect did this have on the resulting print?
It prevented the layers of plastic from being applied evenly.
So when you test-fired the gun, what happened?
It misfired.
So would you say
that the fault for this lies
with BlockStock, the designer of the 3-D printer?
Yes.
Your Honor, no offense to my codefendants,
but I fail to see how Mr. McVeigh's
testimony is relevant to my client.
Uh, Ms. Lockhart, would you care to enlighten us?
Mr. Fife's web site links to the
BlockStock 3-D printer site.
Your Honor, that connection is ridiculously tenuous.
It's joint and several liability, Your Honor.
Mr. Fife and BlockStock were both negligent here.
Therefore we can and should be able to recover damages
from both.
Makes sense to me.
Mr. Fife should make himself comfortable.
So don't you want Diane here and not me?
No.
This is the feed tube from Carsten Pope's printer.
Look through it.
Sure.
I can't.
It's clogged.
After Carsten Pope printed his gun,
he made several coffee mugs.
Okay, well, that's oddly innocuous.
You think that's what caused the misfire, mixing the plastics?
I don't know. That's why we test.
Well, it's intact.
So... that's bad?
Maybe.
Well, the printer worked fine,
which means that the company's not at fault.
Yeah, it also means that the gun Pope fired
wasn't based on a bad design either.
Right. Good. Except, you know... We have no idea
why the gun failed.
Yeah.
But the first order of business is dropping BlockStock
from the suit. They did nothing wrong.
BBL has always been about...
Do you want anything for your hair?
No. I'm good. Thank you.
Okay.
You think our campaign managers know we're alone in here?
I think our campaign managers think we're running off together.
We could do worse.
Go ahead. I don't mind.
No.
I'm sick of phones. It's always bad news.
Not for you these days.
Not that I'm following the polls.
Oh, I think it's too close to call.
Oh, I don't think it is.
Whenever I think I'm certain about something,
I'm always surprised.
It's a bad process, isn't it?
Horrible.
Anything you'd do differently?
I'd be more honest.
How 'bout you?
The debate.
Oh, right.
And the closeted charge. I would answer it.
You still can.
No one thinks it's wrong to be gay.
Can I tell you a secret?
Who else but your opponent?
I'm not gay. I'm a Jesuit.
I never remarried
because you only get married once.
To remarry is to commit adultery.
It's the God's honest truth.
Wh... why didn't you say that?
Well, we didn't want to lose the gay vote
and-and... besides, it makes you look weird.
What person in this day and age takes Jesus Christ seriously
when he says, "You can't divorce"?
Not someone you want to get a beer with.
You are...
better than I am.
No.
Oh, yeah.
Unfortunately.
It's been good fighting you.
Good luck on your speech.
Think I should put something in my hair?
No.
You're perfect.
Hello, Eli, how are you?
Well, that depends. Are you sending money to the Palestinians?
I hate these silences, Alicia.
Where are you hearing this, Eli?
I just got a call from a friend in the Justice Department.
He asked me to check if you're funding some...
pro-Palestinian charity based in Detroit.
It's Dearborn.
And no, I'm not.
Alicia, what the hell?
You're sending money to Hamas?
No, it's not me,
it's Louis Canning. He's sick,
and he wanted to do something nice...
What, send money to Hamas?
for the donor of his kidney.
They wanted to give money to this charity, and...
there's a possibility that this charity...
might be connected to Hamas.
So I was checking on it for him, that's all.
Why were you checking?
Because he asked me to and David Lee wouldn't.
So I did.
Oh, Alicia, you're being set up.
What? What are you...
This Canning guy is suing you, right?
And David Lee is no friend, and they both found a way
for you to check on giving money to Hamas.
He's on his deathbed, Eli.
Canning's not gonna prank me on his deathbed.
Why not?
Because...
I don't know. I'm giving up.
Good-bye.
What's wrong?
Nothing. What do you mean?
You look like something's wrong.
No, but there's been a change. You look great.
Thanks. What changed?
Go after Peter.
Go after him?
Yes, for racial disparities when he was SA.
I gave the new speech to the teleprompter.
What changed?
Nothing. I was wrong. This is the smart thing to do.
Oh, that's Prady. He's doing well.
Yeah. You're next.
Go after Peter. Kill him.
No mercy.
Okay.
Welcome to the Freedom Factory.
Just-just signed the lease and got a copy of the keys right here.
We finally have all this, this elbow room.
And-and the... the heater works.
I, I think about all the time and money,
uh, we wasted trying to print in my parents' garage.
Yeah, we're not gonna miss that damn icebox.
McVeigh.
I'm sorry... what?
Have you tried printing the gun in a cold-temperature environment?
Have I...?
Who is this?
Kalinda.
See, low or fluctuating temperatures can impede
the layers of plastic from adhering correctly.
Every politician struggles with the 11th Commandment.
Speak no ill
of your fellow party member.
Because sometimes you just disagree.
But when that disagreement is with someone
who is not just a fellow traveler, but...
in my case, a spouse,
it gets even more complicated.
Because the most insidious form of racism
is unconscious and exists in our legal system.
My husband was a good State's Attorney.
But he made some mistakes.
Eli?
Consider yourself out of a job,
you son of a bitch.
Well, you do what you have to do, Eli.
I'm running a campaign.
It's already done.
Enjoy the speech.
There's the saying "Racism without racist."
I think this perfectly describes Cook County
and the SA's Office.
I think about all the time and money,
uh, we wasted trying to print in my parents' garage.
We're not gonna miss that damn icebox.
You knew that printing in cold temperatures warps the plastic
and weakens the structure of the gun, didn't you?
This... is a new field with a lot of variables...
A simple yes or no, please.
Yes.
And did you offer any warning
as to the effect of cold temperatures on the printing process?
No, no, but buyer needs to beware.
Five million.
Excuse me?
You have to drop the suit
and sign this nondisclosure agreement.
Fife doesn't have that kind of insurance.
Where is the money coming from?
An interested party has been following the case.
The NRA?
No, private individuals who understand
the importance of this evolving issue,
and would be willing to underwrite Fife's defense.
We have a right to know.
No, actually, you don't.
But you have the right to take it, Mr. Summerfeldt,
and drop this suit. Or you don't...
and then my mysterious benefactor
uses his bounty of treasure to destroy you.
So, what do you say, Mr. Summerfeldt?
Alicia?
How are you today?
Good.
Looks like you might be, too.
Yeah.
Getting stronger.
Good.
So, are you setting me up?
Am I, am I, am I setting you up?
The 18 million you wanted donated--
is that a scheme with David Lee?
I really have...
no idea what you're talking about.
You wanted your stocks liquidated
and given to a Palestinian charity?
I-I what...?
The donor's family.
You wanted 18 million given to them.
You wanted to do good.
No, I didn't! What do you mean, what do you mean I want to do good?
You don't remember the conversation we had yesterday?
You gave me power of attorney.
Alicia, what the hell?! Where's my money?!
Well, there were some complications.
That's why I'm here.
Anesthesia plus tremor meds.
I was in a, in a, in a, in a fugue state!
I can't... Where, where, where's my money?!
Right where it belongs. With David Lee.
Oh, thank God!
Okay.
I'm going now.
This was... great.
Always fun talking to you.
Alicia, wait!
Can you, can you hand me my phone?
You mean... this phone here?
Yeah, you know, don't-don't kid around.
Just hand me the phone.
No.
I think it looks good
right...
there.
Alicia...
Good seeing you, Mr. Canning.
Oh, now it's ringing!
Can you get...? What...?
Nurse!
Just came to see how you were doing.
I'll be fine.
But I think I owe you an apology.
I let my political passions drive a wedge between us.
And that's never been how we do things.
True.
Oh, he of few words.
I think we need to go away together.
Good.
What do you think about a week in Italy this May?
The Amalfi Coast.
Actually, I was, uh, thinking more like tomorrow.
I can't get away for a week.
Yeah, I know.
Three days of deer hunting in Wyoming
with the richest men in the country.
Sure, let's go.
Hi. I thought you were out.
I was out.
Just getting back.
Uh, listen, I didn't get to congratulate you.
The speech went very well.
It did. Thanks.
So, another 48 hours.
Yeah, yeah. There's a story out that you're supporting Hamas?
I don't need to worry about that, do I?
No.
Good.
Um... listen, I'm not very...
not very good at expressing my feelings, uh...
so I don't really like to...
Do you want to come inside?
No, no, no. I just... I don't know.
I-I don't know. You know what? Oh, whatever.
