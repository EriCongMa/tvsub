you hungry ?
mrs. van horn , are you trying to seduce me ?
well , whatever gave you that idea , honey ?
dinner first .
then dessert .
come here .
okay .
okay .
have it your way .
you &apos;re the boss .
you &apos;re in big trouble now .
oh , yeah ? yeah ?
you coming in ?
kaylea !
morning .
good morning .
you nervous about today ?
i just can &apos;t believe after so many years ,
today &apos;s the last day that i &apos;m going to be putting on a uniform .
look , i &apos;m not gonna lie to you
and tell you it &apos;s an easy transition ,
because it &apos;s not , okay ?
but you &apos;re gonna be fine .
i mean , you should be excited . this is , uh ...
it &apos;s like a new chapter in your life .
it &apos;s @-@ it &apos;s the beginning of an adventure .
are you sure it doesn &apos;t bother you ?
what ?
billy being my new boss ?
why , because he &apos;s your ex ?
no , it doesn &apos;t bother me . i &apos;m fine .
you &apos;re lying . totally lying .
well , of course i &apos;m lying .
look , i trust you , okay ?
that &apos;s all i need .
okay ?
good .
come here .
i got to get that .
yeah , i know .
i &apos;ll call you later .
okay .
bye .
so , around about 2 : 00 a.m. ,
neighborhood security noticed the property &apos;s front gate open .
they investigated , found two vics ,
kaylea and dr. phillip van horn .
they &apos;re old hawaiian money .
big philanthropists here on the island .
this place looks fortified .
any idea how the perps got in ?
no , there &apos;s no signs of forced entry ,
so whoever did this knew how to bypass the security system .
what about those cameras ?
disabled .
all right , we got fancy art on the walls .
look at this .
very expensive watch still on the table .
clearly this wasn &apos;t a simple robbery .
all right , well , the killer tossed the place looking for something .
we need to work out what that was .
oh . do you hear that ?
detective , you can &apos;t go in there .
what &apos;s going on ?
we &apos;re not supposed to touch her till family services arrives .
come on , man .
she &apos;s scared . come here .
come here . come here .
it &apos;s okay . i know . it &apos;s okay .
i know .
you all right ?
come here .
she all right ?
yeah .
whatever they were looking for
cost this little girl her family .
come here . come on .
wow , max .
i didn &apos;t know you spoke german . i &apos;m impressed .
in the words of optimus prime , i am more than meets the eye .
was that who i think it was ?
oh , yes . and i &apos;m happy to report
that after very difficult negotiations ,
i am very close to procuring the requested item .
yes .
what is that ? what are you talking about ?
max is , uh ... he &apos;s helping me , uh ... he &apos;s helping me
get together a gift for catherine for her ceremony tonight .
oh , that &apos;s nice . you got a personal shopper now .
why you got to be like ... what , are you jealous now ?
the request was more akin
to a favor solicited by one bff to another .
oh , you guys are bff . i didn &apos;t know .
what do you mean , bff .
boom . like that . bff .
i think that &apos;s adorable . it &apos;s cute .
max , ignore him . what do you got ?
yes , well , based on entry wounds and powder burns ,
i believe your suspects shot the victims
at close range using suppressors .
suspects ? as in more than one ?
that is correct .
striations on the bullets suggest that three weapons were fired .
i had ballistics run them through ibis ,
but unfortunately no matches were found .
three shooters all with suppressors .
that &apos;s a professional hit .
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m alani .
they said i &apos;d find my sister down here .
i was just at my sister &apos;s house the other day .
it was my niece &apos;s first time in the pool .
everyone was so happy .
ma &apos;am , we think the people who did this
were looking for something inside that house .
do you have any idea what that could have been ?
they have so many nice things .
i couldn &apos;t even begin to guess .
um , you know , we were thinking that
it might &apos;ve been something that was hidden .
so did your sister ever talk about , uh ,
something like that ?
no .
family services said , uh ,
you &apos;re going to take custody of your niece . how is she ?
thank god she &apos;s @-@ she &apos;s too young
to understand what &apos;s going on .
but one day she &apos;s gonna want
to know who did this to her parents .
i want to be able to give her an answer .
man .
what &apos;s up ?
nothing . i just got off the phone with kono .
she okay ?
she and adam made it to hong kong .
so they &apos;re safe . for now .
listen , uh ,
hpd &apos;s rounding up all of
michael noshimuri &apos;s known yakuza associates .
any of them are thinking about getting cute ,
couple days in the hole ,
they &apos;ll have second thoughts , right ?
i should be on a plane to hong kong .
look , if that would get kono back ,
we &apos;d all be on a plane .
best thing we can do right now is get our head in the game .
yeah .
all right , so , uh , van horn &apos;s insurance company
sent over photos of all the valuables in their home .
csu &apos;s cross @-@ checking it
against everything at the scene .
all right , so if something was stolen ,
we &apos;ll know soon enough .
yeah , but get this .
most of the valuables were insured
under the van horn family trust .
which means that there &apos;s one person
who &apos;s about to cash in in a major way .
hewitt van horn .
phillip &apos;s only sibling .
what do we know about him ?
for starters , he &apos;s been in and out of trouble his whole life ,
drug charges , multiple arrests .
okay , so he &apos;s the black sheep of the family .
mm @-@ hmm . and according to the family lawyer ,
he blew through the last of his trust fund six months ago ,
which means he &apos;s now completely broke .
and get this .
according to the security company ,
anyone entering the van horn home
was assigned a personal access code .
it was a way of keeping track of who was coming and going .
guess whose code was used at the time of the murders .
room service !
yeah , break out the bibs . it &apos;s lobster time .
whoa , where &apos;s the fire , brah ?
what &apos;s up ?
ladies , let &apos;s go .
out , out , out , out , out .
hewitt ,
this is how you celebrate your newfound wealth , huh ?
hookers and blow ?
yeah , so ?
what &apos;s it to you guys ?
what &apos;s it to us ? listen to me .
listen to me , you lowlife .
explain something to me .
how long did you wait
till after your brother and his wife were dead
to buy your first eight ball ?
15 minutes ? 20 minutes ?
i gotta tell you , man ,
i &apos;ve heard of stupid before ,
but orchestrating a murder
and then supplying the hired guns
with your own personalized security code ...
come on . wh @-@ what is that ?
you @-@ you must be the einstein of stupidity .
hold up . are you ...
are you saying phillip and kaylea are dead ?
oh , god .
oh , it &apos;s all my fault .
what is all your fault ?
some guy approached me at a club .
said he ... said he wanted to steal something from phillip &apos;s .
i @-@ i didn &apos;t even ask what .
he offered 15 grand for my security code .
15 grand !
i needed that money .
but he promised no one would get hurt .
oh , they did ?
why don &apos;t you go tell that to your niece ?
is she okay ?
no , she &apos;s not okay , stupid .
she &apos;s gonna grow up without parents .
who &apos;d you sell the code to ?
i don &apos;t know his name .
who &apos;d you sell the code to ? !
i swear , i don &apos;t .
but i know what he looks like .
okay , good .
good . then you are gonna give
a full description to the police department .
and then you are gonna spend a very long time in jail .
you understand ?
so , the killers knew that hewitt was weak , right ?
figured he &apos;d sell out quick .
plus , they threw in the promise that nobody &apos;d get hurt .
yeah , one dead brother ,
and the other one going to prison for a very long time .
tell you what . tell you , the key to figuring this out
is working out what was stolen from that house .
if ... if something was stolen .
we still don &apos;t know if these guys got what they were looking for .
what time is , uh , catherine &apos;s ceremony ?
6 : 30 .
what , &quot; aha &quot; ? what is that ?
what is that face ?
you know , uh , when this is all over ,
you &apos;re only gonna have yourself to blame .
oh , my ... you &apos;re gonna do this again ?
again , really ?
well , i &apos;m gonna keep doing it until i beat it
into that dopey head of yours , until you understand .
you know what ? i &apos;ve known you long enough , danny , to know
that the only way to get you to shut up is to let you speak .
so , you know what ? go ahead , enlighten me , dr. phil .
oh ... i &apos;m op ... i &apos;m ready . i &apos;m ready to change .
law of nature says that if you take a boy rabbit ,
and you take a girl rabbit , and you put &apos; em into a cage together
over a long period of time ,
what do you think is going to happen ?
are you real ... are you really doing it ?
are you really gonna compare billy and catherine to rabbits ?
we &apos;re all animals .
we &apos;re not rabbits .
but we are animals , and this is my point .
it is a fact , after these long nights ,
long , hardworking nights , bad chinese food ,
law of nature says ,
these two people are going to have a moment .
a moment ?
a moment .
a moment .
a moment where they look at each other in the eye ,
and bing , just like that , everything comes back .
all those old feelings .
and you &apos;re gonna have nobody else to blame but yourself ,
because you let her take a job with her ex @-@ boyfriend .
this pause right now-- does this mean you &apos;re done ,
or are you just taking a breath in between stupid assumptions ?
stupid assumptions .
you can live in denial all you want ,
but this is a fact of life , okay ?
when things are going good ,
nobody thinks they &apos;re gonna go bad .
and that &apos;s when you get hit with it-- when you least expect it .
okay ? that &apos;s all . i &apos;m not gonna say anything else .
for now . today .
this photo was taken six months ago
in phillip van horn &apos;s home office .
it &apos;s filled with hawaiian artifacts .
after csu finished processing the scene ,
every item in this picture was accounted for , except one .
it looks like a piece of whale bone .
it &apos;s a scrimshaw .
and according to his insurance company ,
that particular piece is almost 150 years old .
and what makes it even more interesting ,
is that is the least valuable item
on the list that they sent over .
not according to the people who executed the van horns .
besides , if it &apos;s out in the open like that ,
why &apos;d they tear up the house ?
well , maybe the van horns moved it ,
or maybe they hid it .
this family seems to have a past shrouded in mystery .
see this ?
that &apos;s the crest of the royal league .
it &apos;s an old hawaiian secret society that no longer exists .
now , our victim phillip van horn &apos;s great @-@ great @-@ grandfather ,
jonas van horn , was believed to be a member .
what do we know about them ?
other than the fact that it was disbanded 70 years ago , not much .
there is somebody
who could tell us more about them ,
but , uh ...
but what ?
chin who is it ?
okay , don &apos;t say i didn &apos;t warn you .
all right , a couple of ground rules .
don &apos;t mention that we &apos;re law enforcement .
in fact , we should hide our badges .
what about my gun ?
uh , that should be fine as long as it stays holstered .
handshakes are also fine .
just let him initiate contact .
and unless you guys have written
some dissertations i don &apos;t know about ,
do not mention jfk , area 51,
and definitely , no matter what ,
do not mention the apollo moon landing .
okay . uh , can we feed him after midnight ?
chin ho kelly .
look at you , all grown up .
get your bony behind in here and give me a big hug .
nice to see you , auntie .
oh , nice to see you .
uh , my friends and i are here to see jerry .
uh , we need his help .
you need jerry &apos;s help ?
you sure ?
jfk , apollo 12,
area 51 .
the denver international airport .
our government wants us to believe
there &apos;s nothing going on .
like police turning you away from a crime scene .
&quot; move along , mr. john q public . there &apos;s nothing to see here . &quot;
but there is much to witness .
and i &apos;ve ducked under the yellow tape .
i &apos;ve read beneath the redacted lines .
the proof is out there .
hey , who &apos;s out there ?
jerry , it &apos;s , uh , chin ho kelly .
chin ho !
hey , buddy .
how are you ?
i &apos;m good , i &apos;m good .
see you ran into moneypenny .
the living @-@ with @-@ your @-@ mom cover has its pros and cons .
pro ? she makes a hell of a peach cobbler .
jerry , these are my friends steve and danny .
hey , man .
so , uh , how do you guys know each other ?
high school .
oh , let me guess .
uh , starting quarterback ,
starting center .
more like starting
trumpet player , starting french horn .
manoa valley band camp , 1985 .
band camp ?
remember how tiny those tents were ?
dude , how could i forget .
it &apos;s like we were stuck on a deserted island all summer .
good times .
tiny tents .
you got any pictures ?
oh , you know it .
no , no , no , he was just joking about the pictures .
no , i &apos;d actually like to see &apos; em .
look , jerry , we were hoping
you could give us some information on the royal league .
royal league .
those guys were the hawaiian illuminati .
yeah . did you ever see this before ?
yeah , that &apos;s the crest of the royal league .
where &apos;d you get this ?
it was stolen from a man named phillip van horn .
somebody murdered him and his wife for it .
van horn ?
holy fox mulder .
do you guys realize what this could be ?
no .
this could be the key !
you mean , like a metaphorical key ?
no . a very literal key
that opens up a 700 @-@ year @-@ old priceless treasure .
you ever hear of the medici &apos;s ?
italy &apos;s most powerful and
influential family of all time .
they produced , like , four popes .
no ?
all right , well , whatever .
these were the medici rings .
crafted in the 1400s ,
stolen in the late @-@ 1800s .
now , around the time of the theft ,
a few members of the royal league were in italy .
jonas van horn among them .
he &apos;s the family patriarch .
there were rumors about their involvement ,
but no one has ever been able to connect them to the rings .
but legend has it ,
the league smuggled them out somehow .
is there any chance they could have been smuggled onto oahu ?
that &apos;s what i always believed .
but , to this day , the rings have never been found .
but i bet this is the key to finding them .
so this is all about getting their hands on these rings ,
and the van horns were just in the way .
right . okay , uh , let &apos;s say i &apos;m buying all of this ,
which i am not .
um , if that scrimshaw is a key ,
what does it open ?
answer that , gentlemen ,
and you &apos;ll solve one of the world &apos;s great mysteries .
i &apos;d settle for solving our murder .
here &apos;s a list of all known royal league members .
okay , well , if what you &apos;re saying is true ,
the people on this list
would have known about the rings and where they were hidden .
right ?
good . all dead .
i &apos;ll just head over to the cemetery
and start asking them questions .
i &apos;ll look up the descendents ,
cross @-@ check them for any criminal activity .
thank you , chin . it &apos;s a good start .
you got a better idea ?
no , i don &apos;t , but just because some whack job says
that jimmy hoffa &apos;s buried under giants stadium
does not mean you go digging up the turf .
no offense , jerry .
none taken .
hoffa &apos;s not buried under giants stadium .
he &apos;s under the runway at laguardia .
there you go .
ah . well , explain to me this , then .
uh , just six months ago , there was a photograph
of the scrimshaw published in a magazine .
why &apos;d the killers wait till now to go after it ?
why didn &apos;t van horn go after the treasure himself ?
you &apos;re totally my scully .
your what ?
it &apos;s possible phillip didn &apos;t know
what he had or what the key opened .
hold on . it &apos;s duke .
duke ?
oh . sorry . scrambler .
duke ? yeah , i &apos;m here .
all right , hewitt van horn &apos;s sit @-@ down
with the hpd sketch artist got us a hit .
the guy who paid for the security code--
his name is griffin moore . he &apos;s got priors .
counterfeiting ,
art fraud and felony assault .
okay , thank you , duke . got it .
he could have been the guy to set up a crew to hit the van horn &apos;s .
yeah . let &apos;s go check it out .
yeah , you guys do your thing ,
and i &apos;ll stay here ,
keep digging into the legend of the missing rings .
good . say hello to the hobbits for me .
five @-@ o !
clear .
got modeling clay and plaster here .
looks like moore was building something .
yeah , it looks , uh , looks like he was doing a lot more than that .
what do you got ?
got a gsw to the back of the skull .
okay , i &apos;m thinking maybe moore got a little greedy
and turned on one of his crew .
maybe his crew turned on him .
surprise !
billy .
what , you think i was gonna miss this ?
and i &apos;d be lying if i didn &apos;t say i was a little worried
you might have second thoughts .
are you kidding me ?
i cannot wait to start .
that &apos;s what i wanted to hear .
all right , let &apos;s eat some cake .
yeah .
yeah , okay , thanks .
had lukela put an alert out on griffin moore .
homeland security has been notified .
oy vay .
nice outfit , jerry .
no jerry here , just a simple tourist .
i don &apos;t leave the house much .
surveillance issues .
looks like a good cover , jerry .
what are you doing here ?
you &apos;re not gonna believe what i found .
a few weeks ago
an auction house in florence was robbed .
the thieves made off with a bunch of letters
from jonas van horn to an american
living in florence in 1880 named daniel frost .
i contacted one of my associates ,
who prefers to remain nameless ,
and he sent me scans of the letters .
what do they say ?
nothing .
nothing about the scrimshaw key or the rings .
just some boring stuff about living in florence .
oh , good , so this is all just
an incredibly gigantic waste of time .
you know , you &apos;re the reason i don &apos;t go outside much .
is that the only reason ?
that boring stuff in the letters--
i think it &apos;s probably coded in some kind of cipher .
pretty awesome , right ?
that &apos;s , that &apos;s awesome .
and here &apos;s the kicker .
daniel frost was an apprentice to thomas gould ,
and guess what statue thomas gould is famous for .
king kamehameha .
built in 1880
around the same time the rings went missing .
i think daniel frost helped jonas van horn smuggle the rings
out of italy inside the statue ,
which means that &apos;s what the scrimshaw key opens .
what ?
what , uh , what are you thinking ?
all that modeling clay , plaster ,
and paint that we found at moore &apos;s place ...
i think he was building a fake king kamehameha statue .
why would he do that ?
i mean , if he had the key ,
why wouldn &apos;t he just come here and open it ?
yeah , but check it out .
i @-@ i @-@ i &apos;ve looked at this statue 5,000 times in my life , okay ?
i &apos;ve never seen a keyhole .
have you ?
no .
if the treasure is inside the statue ,
there &apos;s no way moore could get to it without being seen .
swapping this statue with a fake is the only way
that he could get to whatever is inside the statue .
nice theory .
only one problem .
moore &apos;s not going after this king kamehameha statue .
what , what , what do you mean ?
there &apos;s two of these ?
the ship with the original king kamehameha statue sunk
on its way to oahu , so they built a second one--
this one here .
years later the original was recovered and returned to hawaii .
that &apos;s the one with the rings inside it .
that &apos;s the statue that moore &apos;s after .
oh , good , okay , where &apos;s that one ?
there she is , boys ,
the beautiful island of hawaii .
oh , oh , oh , eyes forward , please .
thank you .
you okay , bruddah ?
you fly a lot ?
all the time .
you ever see any black helicopters ?
catherine .
hey . hey , thanks for calling me back .
listen , i need a favor , okay ?
i &apos;m gonna send you some letters .
uh , there may be a message embedded in them .
i need cryptology to look them over .
steve , i was just about to hand in my paperwork .
okay , this will only take a couple of minutes .
all my stuff is packed .
they even got me a cake .
catherine , two good people have been murdered ,
and what &apos;s in these letters
could help us catch their killers .
all right , you got it .
夏威夷岛
it &apos;s plaster .
original is cast in brass .
wow , you were right . it is a fake .
moore already switched the statues .
then , where &apos;s the real one ?
okay , well , here &apos;s what i know .
city maintenance truck was reported stolen two nights ago--
the same night that this footage was taken .
which means that moore switched the statue
before the van horns were murdered .
okay , so these three guys-- they could be our shooters , right ?
we know one of them is griffin moore .
who are the other two ?
wait a minute , chin .
moore &apos;s not even here .
that &apos;s because he &apos;s dead .
the skull you found in the kiln--
the dental records matched griffin moore .
it appears he died from a gunshot wound to the head .
ballistics did confirm that it matches the same caliber
that was used to kill the van horns .
hi , i &apos;m dr. max bergman .
jerry ... just jerry .
he &apos;s not big on last names .
all right , chin ,
let &apos;s run facial recognition on these guys .
commander , shall we , uh , step into your office ?
oh , that &apos;s it ?
yes , uh , let me know the second you get a hit .
yeah .
you found it , huh ?
my ebay auction handle isn &apos;t therealjedimaxter for nothing .
buddy , what do i owe you ?
$ 1,326.41 .
$ 1,300 ?
i thought you were a jedi .
commander , i @-@ i don &apos;t think you truly understand the value
of what you have in your possession .
this is a hot stamper , a limited pressing .
a classic .
catherine is going to be extremely grateful
when you give it to her .
i &apos;m sure she will ,
max , but $ 1,300 is a lot of money , okay , for me .
well , do you want it or not ?
i ...
yes ... yes .
all right .
78-- i have $ 78 , okay ?
that &apos;s everything i have today , all right ?
i &apos;ll pay you the rest as soon as i get it .
layaway ?
layaway ? no , it &apos;s-- you &apos;re doing me a favor .
thank you , by the way .
fine , when you have all the money , then it will be yours .
you &apos;re aware i carry a gun , right , max ?
got &apos; em .
one on the left is ellis gregory .
he &apos;s ex @-@ british military .
interpol &apos;s got a lot of paper on him--
theft , fraud , assault .
he and his two partners are wanted
for murder in connection with a high @-@ end museum heist in prague .
they were last seen in italy three weeks ago .
around the same time that the letters
were stolen from the auction house in florence .
so these are our guys .
moore was just a pawn .
he built the fake statue
and got the van horns &apos; security code .
yeah , and as soon as services were rendered ,
they shot him and they dumped him in the oven .
these guys had to have come in on fake passports .
i &apos;ll cross @-@ check their faces with tsa security cameras .
all right .
catherine .
you don &apos;t say .
no , we &apos;re on the way .
you were right , jerry .
there was a hidden code inside those letters .
let &apos;s go .
stevie wonder , what are you doing ?
if you see something you shouldn &apos;t ,
they won &apos;t ever let you leave .
i think you should get a girlfriend , buddy .
hey , cath .
hey .
jerry , you can open your eyes .
this is jerry-- he is our special consultant .
yeah , roswell division .
it &apos;s nice to meet you , jerry , i &apos;m catherine .
uh , why don &apos;t you guys come this way ?
she &apos;ll do .
oh , no , no , no , listen ,
her , uh , boyfriend is a complete animal .
you want to stay away from that one , trust me .
okay , so the correspondences between frost and van horn
were intentionally innocuous .
i called that .
when we analyzed the text using a frequency count ,
certain words kept appearing in a sequence .
did you apply a transposition cipher ?
yes , we did .
i &apos;m impressed--you know your stuff .
thanks .
so , using that cipher , we isolated every second letter
of the remaining words .
i don &apos;t get it .
looks like one of those word search puzzles .
no , no , no , it &apos;s not a puzzle .
it &apos;s a scytale .
uh , imagine a 19th century rubik &apos;s cube ,
only instead of a square , it &apos;s a horizontal cylinder ,
and instead of matching colors , you &apos;re creating words .
exactly ,
and once you rotate the letters around the cylinder ...
... it reveals a hidden message .
without a computer , something like this would take months to decode .
look at that .
&quot; beneath the king &apos;s ...
&quot; heavy right foot ...
&quot; a leaf reveals ...
&quot; with a turn ...
the truth within . &quot;
i was right .
woof . i think i need to sit down .
wait a minute , the rings ...
are under the king &apos;s foot .
that &apos;s why they had to switch the statue out , right ?
they had to get beneath it .
chin , what do you got ?
our suspects did enter the country using aliases ,
and when they arrived in honolulu , they rented a van .
i pinged it , and i &apos;m sending you the location now .
get up . get up .
get up . get up .
get up .
get up . get up .
what ... ? i &apos;m bleeding .
yeah , i can see that .
watch my shoes .
danny , we got the big boy here .
you haven &apos;t opened the statue yet , have you ?
hey , you haven &apos;t opened the statue yet , right ?
where are your partners ?
you don &apos;t want to talk .
you &apos;re a lot smarter than you look , mate .
okay .
here &apos;s the thing , uh , you like orphaning little kids ,
i like shooting bad guys .
everybody goes home happy , right ?
you okay with this ? huh ?
100 % .
you two are crazy .
yeah .
you can &apos;t do that .
why haven &apos;t you opened the statue yet ?
