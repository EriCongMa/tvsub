Gossip gril here,
you're one of the resources
into the scandalous lives of manhattan's elite.
Dad, I am so sorry. I wanted to tell you.
Tell me what?
This is milo humphrey, your grandson.
A body washed up in paris--shot.
The identification they found says it's charles bass.
What's your name?
Henry.
Welcome to paris, henry.
Let's go home.
I think I need to be alone for a while.
Oh, so I didn't realize you and Serena were actually over.
I'm not gonna spend the entire summer
waiting for her to figure things out.
Could I at least get your number?
What, it's not in your friend's little black book?
When you're ready to talk about
what really got you into this place, give me a call.
You know what? You were right. I... I was hurt.
Do you wanna meet up to grab a cup of coffee?
That sounds great, yeah.
I thought that someone who loved what I love
could one day love me, too, but I guess not.
No, no, no.
I've been acting like I'm okay, but I'm not.
What if I never get over chuck?
Summer is coming to a close, and as everyone knows,
Paris, like the upper east side,
empties out in August,
leaving behind only the tourists and the dreamers,
lamenting the imminent return to real life.
I can't believe it's almost time to go back to New York already.
I know, and you still
haven't made your Sophie's choice
between Brooklyn and the upper east side.
What? If you go back with an uncertain heart,
there will be drama and disaster for all.
It's like choosing between eclairs and napoleons.
They're both delicious.
Except Humphrey's a doughnut.
Well, I would love to stay and talk patisserie,
but I have to get ready for my perfect parisian date.
Wait, what? You got Louis to give you a second chance?
B., that's great.
And to prove that I care about more than his title,
I've planned a day
of polite interaction with the proletariat.
Think Diana, princess of the people.
Obviously, I'll wear gloves.
Obviously.
Well, I'm off to buy gently worn items in the 12th.
And don't worry.
not even you choosing a Humphrey will ruin my date.
Nothing will.
Au revoir.
Hi, mom.
I'm sorry to bother you
on your last day, Serena.
I got a very upsetting phone call from the Paris police.
Oh, if it's about Blair pushing me in the fountain,
I'm not pressing charges.
They pulled a body out of the river
and found Charles' wallet.
Oh, my god. You don't think it's him, do you?
Well, it would be a lot easier not to panic
if someone had heard from him
or he had been paying the Empire bills.
Listen, um, sweetheart,
they need a family member to identify the body.
If it's too much for you, I will be on the next flight.
No, no, I'm--I'm here. I can do it.
Thank you.
Listen, let's just keep this between us.
I don't want to worry anyone
until we know for sure what's really going on.
Yean, I agree.
I'm sorry for the 7-hour-long story.
Are you kidding?
Serena took her best friend's boyfriend's virginity,
ran away to boarding school,
bounced from guy to guy
until dating your married congressman cousin,
fell in love with you,
and then cheated on you with your friend,
who's also her ex?
Yep.
The only thing that would make it better
is if one of those boyfriends turned out to be her brother.
Well, does stepbrother count?
The life of Serena Van Der Woodsen
is like the most complicated Jane Austen novel ever.
Aren't you glad you finally reached the last chapter?
I haven't even responded yet.
Things between us-- they never really ended.
They just... Stopped, and...
Instead of dealing with them, I-I just...
You little-black-booked the pain away?
Exactly.
Well, do you wanna get back together with her?
I don't know.
You know, it would be nice if I were the one deciding, not her.
In that case, the first thing you need to do
is eliminate the competition. What was his name again?
Dan's not the competition, all right. He's my friend.
Besides, for all I know,
He's not even interested in her anymore.
And what happens if it's too late by the time you find out?
Look...
I can help.
Let me... Be your life coach
For the next 24 hours,
And I promise you, you will be in a place
where you're the one making the choice.
Brooklyn, you say?
Why don't we just both go home, shower, get dressed,
And I'll meet you there?
Sounds good.
Good.
The body
was in no condition for fingerprints,
but...
we found this.
That's his.
We're testing the blood on the wallet.
Do you need a moment
to gather yourself?
No amount of time will ever make this okay.
Five more minutes.
As pleasurable as those 300 seconds sound,
your uncle was already generous enough
to help the strange American
you brought home from Prague.
I don't want to be late for my first day on the job.
One thing I'll miss about taking care of you after the shooting
will be spending all day in bed together.
I couldn't have enjoyed being saved more.
I'm just happy to be taking care of you now.
I know a way you could take care of me right now.
I wouldn't be able to tear myself away.
Then what would your uncle think?
You're a good man, Henry Prince.
Too good.
This loft is your loft
This loft is my loft
Where's your Aunt Jenny
She moved to Hudson
She wears... Leggings
Wow. I did not need to see or hear that.
No. Well, I'm--I'm doing the best I can.
Who's this?
This is Juliet Sharp. She's a new friend.
Pleasure to meet you, Dan.
I hope you don't mind me tagging along.
No, no. Vanessa's supposed to be here already,
and Georgina's at the SPA,
And Milo has not been taking his bottle all morning.
Oh, buddy. I think he's kind of mad at me.
You all right?
Yeah, you wanna hold him, Nate?
You don't expect me to sing, do you?
No. Just make sure you prop his neck up.
Oh, he smells funny.
Oh, maybe he just needs a woman's voice.
Okay.
Whatever you were singing was definitely not that. Hmm?
Ask him, like we agreed.
Come here. Yeah. You're so cute.
She's definitely not out of Chuck's little black book.
No. No, she, uh, sure isn't.
So... Have you heard from Serena lately?
Uh, no. No, I haven't.
I would assume she's still in Paris or at Brown already.
Actually, gossip girl said she's going to Columbia.
She's--she's coming back to the city for school now?
That's what the blast said. You not okay with that?
No. No, I'm fine with it... I guess.
I-I'm just surprised she didn't say anything to me about it.
But if she didn't say anything to you...
Hey, Dan, can you grab a diaper?
Yeah. Yeah, I'll do it.
What is it?
Well, he said he hadn't heard from her.
Looks like Dan's playing a game with you.
Now do you want to win,
or do you want to lose?
I suppose it's worth missing you
if it means staying in a place
where you don't have nightmares.
And you look very handsome in your work clothes.
Well, I look forward to you removing them
after an honest day's work.
Bye.
Bye.
They say it's easy to forget your troubles
when the weather's warm.
But all it takes is one fall breeze
to blow reality right back in your face.
What are you doing?
Suddenly we're stopping for pedestrians? Vite!
Watch out, Blair.
He who sows the wind reaps the storm.
Next time, I promise we'll do shoes and vintage,
and not just health food stores.
Aw. Let me see that beautiful boy.
Well, you guys seem to have bonded.
We had a nice talk.
Aw, Vanessa, you're amazing with him.
Yeah, she's a serious baby whisperer.
Living on a commune, you clock a lot of babysitting hours.
Right?
Okay, I get what you're doing,
and it's not exactly subtle.
The goal is to take him out of the equation.
Not by using Vanessa.
She's still totally in love with him.
She's just hurt by what happened last spring,
and she's looking for a sign
to see how he really feels about her.
She told you that?
She didn't have to.
I'm not trying to ruin people's lives.
Vanessa and Dan are great people.
And from what I hear, they made a great couple, too.
Yeah. Okay, I will.
I love you, too. Bye.
"I love you, Nate" or "I love you, Dan"?
"I love you, mom."
Oh. Well, it's all right. Now that I'm an egalitarian,
I'll accept it even if you choose Dan,
and not just because he's ahead in the "Gossip Girl" poll.
Gossip Girl has a poll?
Honestly, I haven't even thought about it.
B., I went to the morgue today.
What is that? A sex club?
A place where they keep dead bodies.
I had to identify one because he had chuck's I.D.
Don't worry. It wasn't him.
I'm not worried.
But, Blair, I just hung up with my mom,
and Chuck is missing.
Well, consider him found.
He was on the rue de charenton an hour ago.
What, you saw him? Here?
Gossip Girl said I was in paris. Where else would he be?
My mom and the police are looking everywhere.
He hasn't paid an empire bill all summer.
His assets are about to be frozen.
I could care less about his bassets.
And besides, he's probably filtering his finances
through some foreign government
so that I won't know he's stalking me.
Well, what did he say when you saw him?
Nothing.
He limped away, and I kept driving.
That doesn't sound very stalker-ish.
It's Chuck. It's probably part of some elaborate scheme.
Well, he did have blood on his wallet,
And you said you saw him limping.
Don't you think we should at least make sure he's okay?
I'm sorry he pissed off the wrong pickpocket.
But I've been waiting for this date all summer.
I'm not gonna let him ruin it.
I'm sure Louis would understand
if you're a little late.
I can't talk to him, S.
You don't know what it was like,
seeing him, even through the car window.
Trust me, the only thing wrong with Chuck
is that I'm gonna be happy without him.
Your oysters, Henry. Here.
I thought you might be ready for a break.
I have to ask.
Your first day made me believe not all american are lazy.
I see you tomorrow. Enjoy Paris.
Merci.
Merci. Voil? Monsieur.
What is wrong? Are you mad at me?
No, you're perfect.
I was just thinking maybe
This isn't the right place for us after all.
Why? Was working with oncle alphonse so horrible?
It's not the job. It's paris.
But you loved it this morning.
And you slept through the night for the first time in weeks.
True, but I credit you with all of that.
I mean, we could live anywhere and be happy.
I hear India is amazing.
For Francais and salma, maybe.
But we can barely afford the bus to Lorraine.
I may have a way to figure out the finances.
well, that was an interesting call.
Was that Paris? News about Chuck?
That was Dr. Feiner from lenox hill.
Unfortunately, he cannot discuss Milo's medical records
with anyone other than his parents.
I was just hoping to get some more information,
Make sure this guy's even a real doctor,
Not some sex phone operator
that crazy girl paid off to lie to us.
Oh, now who's crazy?
Georgina went for a Spa weekend
right after Dan signed the birth certificate.
We need to get our own paternity test done while she's gone.
Well, she said we could.
It's not like we have to sneak around behind her back.
Now whatever you might believe,
Your son is in Brooklyn,
struggling to take care of a baby.
So you can sit here and brood all by yourself,
or you can come with me
and help me turn Jenny's room into a nursery
so that child has a proper place to sleep.
You know where I'll be if you change your mind.
Have you ever seen anyone sleep so deeply?
I know you said things were complicated,
but you and Dan really seem to click.
We do...
Or did,
before the thing with Serena.
You have to tell her.
Dan made Nate promise not to tell you, so...
You can't say anything, but he does have feelings for you.
He told us himself.
Really?
You should go for it, yeah.
My friend saw him around here this morning.
He has an intimate relationship with alcohol,
so I figured I'd check all the bars first.
He doesn't drink here,
but he looks very much like my new waiter.
Is he American, from New York?
All I know is he came to Paris from,
uh, Prague with my niece.
Well, if he's who I think he is, he could be in a lot of trouble.
I-I need to talk to him.
He doesn't do much talking, especially about himself.
Please, sir,
I've been to every bar in the neighborhood.
And he's my stepbrother, and I'm very worried about him.
If you have any idea where he is, please...
Tell me you didn't rob a bank.
My grandfather left me a small inheritance.
I've just been waiting for the right thing to spend it on.
But it doesn't look small to me.
It's enough to get us to London, then Kerala.
Are you sure you wanna do this?
I've never been more sure of anything.
Is it hot or cold in Kerala?
Do we need shots?
And what do I pack?
Chuck, it's you.
Who's here?
Oh, hi. I'm Serena van der Woodsen.
I'm--I'm really sorry to show up like this.
I've just been looking for Chuck everywhere.
Henry, what is she talking about?
I don't know. The man you're looking for is not here.
Holy Bruce Wayne, batman.
It's one thing to hide who you really are.
It's another to pretend you don't exist.
I had no idea
you had such deep appreciation for street food.
I'm quite surprised
that your favorite restaurant is on rue de la huchette.
Yes, well, the masterpieces of The Louvre don't compare
to the simple pleasures of the kebab.
Paris is complicated
and beautiful...
much like you.
But you know what's even better than street food?
Street artists.
I heard there's an amazing bucket drummer
at the pont neuf metro station. Should we investigate?
Well, I was thinking
more of a chauffeured drive in the country,
to the ball my parents are throwing for the givenchy exhibition.
Oh! Givenchy was Audrey's favorite.
Does that mean you-- you'll allow me to escort you
to cheau de harou?
Nothing would make me happier,
except maybe saving this for later.
Where's Milo?
I gave him a bottle and
put him down in your bedroom.
You know, he should really have a nursery.
Yeah, I know. I've been meaning to get to that.
You hungry?
Always. I can't remember the last time that
I ate something that didn't come out of a... A box.
Did you do all this?
I thought you deserved a bottle, too.
You've been under so much pressure, I can't even imagine.
I really missed you.
I missed you, too.
I know that I-I-I haven't gotten a full night's sleep in a while.
I don't really know what I'm saying half the time.
But I'm so grateful that you've been here helping me.
And after everything that--that, you know, I put your through,
which I haven't even apologized for,
I haven't explained it.
Stop talking.
You know I'm not good at that.
I think I can help.
I had a feeling you'd linger.
I'm not gonna leave.
Chuck, today I had to identify a body
that the police thought was you.
Did you do something to that man?
If--if it was self-defense,
I'm sure that they would understand.
I never touched that thief.
So is Blair right? Is this another one of your games?
Do I look like I'm playing?
I know more than anyone
what it's like to want to reinvent yourself.
But just because people are mad at you
doesn't mean you should disappear.
My mom is really worried about you.
I'm sure she'll come to celebrate my absence,
as will all the people
who've wished me dead since the day I was born.
I know things were bad in New York.
But if you don't come home, you'll lose the Empire.
You'll lose everything you ever cared about.
I already lost the only thing I cared about.
They can have everything else.
I don't know what you told that girl,
but you can't turn your back on who you really are.
I'm going to see an old associate,
picking up a passport with my new name on it.
After today, there is no Chuck Bass.
I'm staying at Eleanor and Cyrus'
when you realize that's not true.
Wow. That was, uh...
Yeah.
I'll have to thank Nate the next time I see him.
Nate? I'm sorry, but, I mean,
I don't mean to be a credit hog, but that was all me.
No, I mean, I'm just-- I'm glad that he told me.
Told you what?
The truth.
Wh--about what?
Okay, after I told Nate that I was nervous
about you still being in love with Serena,
he said that it wasn't true
and that you told him you still had feelings for me.
And there it is.
I-I'll go.
Okay.
Perhaps it should be tilted more.
Oh, wow. A coronation already? The date must've gone well.
Oh, S., we walked, we talked, we laughed.
I'd forgotten what it was like to just have fun with a guy.
And now I'm off to meet his parents at a ball.
Just look at all the gowns he sent!
The fairy tale is back on
as long as the evil queen doesn't ruin it.
Well, if you're talking about Chuck, don't worry.
The only person he wants to poison is himself.
You talked to Chuck? No. I don't care.
I don't even wanna know what he said.
I've been waiting all summer to feel sparkly again,
and I won't be pulled back into the darkness.
You're right.
Go live your fairy tale. Don't worry about Chuck.
If that is Didier Ludot,
tell them they should've been more prompt!
Now, you... This is all wrong.
I can't believe your people invented the coiffure.
Yes. That's more like it.
I can't even see myself!
Claire Von Rohr.
Gorgeous blonde.
Princeton.
Oh, and look. Her family has a house by ours in Trancoso.
Okay, yeah, she sounds great, but I-I don't get it.
What are you saying?
You're gonna go on a date with her.
Well, I thought the whole point was to be available.
The point was for Dan not to be.
You have to have somebody fabulous on your arm
So Serena doesn't think
that you spent the whole summer pining for her.
Here, let me call--
Okay, listen, I appreciate the gesture,
but you don't know Serena van der Woodsen.
Not just any hot girl is gonna spark her jealousy.
So what are you saying? You have a better option?
Louis, merci pour tout...
No.
I can't do any more of these prince and pauper games.
I'm sorry, madame.
Monsieur simply asked me to escort you
for one final touch before the gala.
Would you like to come with me to Harry Winston?
Would I?
Is there some business you need to attend to before we go?
Nothing I have any interest in.
Escort away.
Blair, call me back.
Remember when I told you not to worry about Chuck?
Well, I was wrong.
Spotted--one American leaving Paris.
Au revoir, l'enfant terrible.
B., you know I wouldn't bother you if it wasn't serious.
I need your help.
Finally.
Inspector Chevalier, of course.
Okay, I'll be right there.
It's beautiful.
I mean, of course, they all are.
Monsieur Grimaldi would want me to be sure it was perfect.
Like that.
Carats, clarity, charisma.
Not that I expect Louis to get me a ring so soon, but...
this is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.
I am sorry. This ring has already been sold.
Shouldn't you be out dealing with your own issues
Instead of hunting me down?
I didn't even know you were here. Why are you here?
Why are you?
I see that you have found monsieur Bass' stolen property.
Mr. Bass' property?
The ring is his?
That's why I'm here.
Inspector chevalier asked me to claim it.
The thieves couldn't pawn such a valuable piece
at their usual haunts in Prague,
so they came to Paris
to try to return it for the cash.
Harry Winston knew monsieur Bass was the original purchaser.
That's when they called us.
And the body you saw was one of the thieves.
So why was Chuck's blood on the wallet?
Monsieur Bass would not let go of the ring.
He fought them hard, so they shot him.
Chuck was shot?
Let me explain...
what the hell, man?
You told Vanessa I had feelings for her?
I just thought you two were connecting.
Why are we whispering? Is she still here?
Yeah, she's--yeah, just-- just keep whispering.
Okay. Look, you guys spent all day together,
Just the two of you.
So? Just because things were great
Doesn't give you the right to lie to her about me.
Was it a lie?
This is about Serena. It is, isn't it?
Okay, I wouldn't have said anything to Vanessa
If you hadn't lied about getting that text.
What text?
When's the last time you checked your phone?
Obviously not as recently as you did.
Oh, man.
Yeah, I'm sorry. It's from Serena.
I thought you saw it.
I got the same one.
Same one what?
Uh, it--it's a text from Serena.
Yeah.
So she's interested in both of you?
Yeah, that's kind of what it seems like.
Yeah, or she's interested in one of us,
and just wants to, like, let the other one down easy maybe.
Oh. Is that why you told me Dan had feelings?
Yeah. I'm--I'm sorry, Vanessa.
Oh, my god.
How stupid can I be
to think you'd actually put Serena behind you?
Vanessa, I'm...
Surprise!
It's time for an extreme nursery makeover.
You know that ring was meant for you.
He was gonna propose to you
on top of the empire state building.
I can't care about that.
It doesn't change what he did instead--Jenny Humphrey.
B., I know how much he hurt you.
He knows how much he hurt you.
That's why he signed over the empire
and everything he owns to my mom.
Well, hopefully she can run it
without entering the human flesh trade.
Blair, he's changing his name.
His landlady said he's on his way to the train station.
This is Chuck we're talking about.
He really could just disappear.
If you're so torn up about it, stop him.
You and I both know you're the only one that can do that.
If you'll excuse me, I have a ball to attend.
Blair.
Blair, he almost died
holding onto that ring
and to the hope of you.
I forgave him for something
that no one else in the world would ever get over.
Then he turned around
and did the one thing he knew I could never let go.
But you don't need to forgive him.
You don't even need to talk to him again after today.
But I know you, and you will always regret it
if you do nothing and just let him disappear.
I'm sorry.
I know.
The truth is, I don't even know how I feel about Serena.
I just... I want a clear shot at finding out without--
I--you don't have to say it.
Yeah.
How do you feel about her?
I was in the middle of trying to figure that out
when I was interrupted by the arrival of Georgina's swollen belly.
It was kinda--kinda hard to focus after that.
I'll take your word for it.
You know, and being with Vanessa--
even if it is thanks to your meddling--felt good.
And all of our problems from last year--Tisch, whatever--
they just feel really, really small now.
Too bad she hates you.
Yeah, maybe.
Or maybe it's for the best. I don't know.
Anyway, Serena gets back tomorrow.
What are we gonna do?
I knew it was too good to be true.
Who is she?
Just because you're dressed poorly
doesn't mean you're not Chuck Bass.
Why would I want to be him?
You should've told me you got shot.
I'm surprised you didn't shoot me yourself.
I have, many times, in my dreams.
The good ones.
But if you were really hurt, I would want to know.
When I woke up, my I.D. was gone.
Nobody knew who I was.
Nobody was coming to look for me.
I realized I might be alive,
but Chuck Bass didn't have to be.
Changing your name doesn't change who you are.
It's a good start,
A chance to live simply, earn people's respect,
maybe become a person someone could love.
Someone did love you.
And...
you owe it to her
and everyone else you're leaving behind
not to run away, which is what you're doing.
And I don't think that great man
you're talking about wanting to be
is a coward.
I think he would face up to what he did.
I destroyed the only thing I ever loved.
I don't love you anymore.
But it takes more than even you
to destroy Blair Waldorf.
Your world would be easier if I didn't come back.
That's true.
But it wouldn't be my world without you in it.
It doesn't feel right to be in New York without you.
Did the plane ride back to reality
land you on either Nate or Dan?
Not exactly.
How could you spend seven hours on a plane
with a library of romantic comedies and not find clarity?
Trust me, I tried.
I even made a list of pros and cons.
Dan--good shoulder to cry on.
Nate--good shoulders.
Well, as long as you promise
that gossip girl won't find out before I do.
I have a poll to win.
I promise. How are you?
Well, I ate too many meringues at lunch,
But talking to chuck made me realize what I want, too.
Good. Well, I hope you get it then.
Merci, mon amie.
Thank you for calling me. And you're right. I'm sorry.
It was wrong for me to interfere.
Well, what was wrong was for me
to hand over control of my life
to a beautiful girl I just met in a restaurant.
Seriously, what was up with that?
I'm kidding.
Blame all here. No more life coach.
Friends?
Friends.
I'd like to apologize to Dan as well.
I know this might actually sound weird,
But I'm--I'm glad that yesterday happened.
Why?
Because after your publicly broadcast pajama party
with serena, you thought I needed more humiliation?
No. No. Because last night when I read on "Gossip girl"
that Serena had boarded a plane home,
I didn't care.
All I could think about was making things right with you.
Now whatever's happened in the past.
Right here, right now.
I wanna be with you.
I hope your calling me means your business is complete.
It is.
I'm sorry I distracted you from your parents' ball.
In paris, there's always another ball.
The Sarkozys are saluting jerry lewis tomorrow night,
If you're not otherwise engaged.
There's nothing I'd rather do than salute Jerry Lewis.
But...
I can't live in this fairy tale.
I promise this is not a story for little girls.
But...
I've been using it
to run away from my real life on the upper east side.
Someone there did something for me that I have to honor.
Will I ever see you again?
You can always come find me.
It's Vivier.
It's worth a hell of a lot more than a glass slipper.
Look, Milo, you have a nursery. Isn't it beautiful?
It is. He's a lucky boy.
Rufus!
Is this the David netto crib that I ordered?
Oh, it's Dan and Jenny's.
I got it out of storage.
I wouldn't want my grandson sleeping in anything else.
I couldn't agree with you more. What changed your mind?
You.
I'll never be sure
if Georgina's telling me the whole truth,
But Dan is my son, and I'm not gonna bail on him.
And if I'm wrong,
how much time have I lost with this little guy
'cause I let my suspicions get the better of me?
Aw. Here. I'm gonna go cancel the other crib.
Would you take him?
Okay. Sure. Hello, buddy.
Thank you.
Milo, I think you have the Humphrey jaw.
Mom! Hey!
Serena. Hi!
Oh! Darling, what are you doing here?
Laryssa told me where you were.
I came straight from the airport.
Well, we have a surprise for you.
Great, but first, I wanna find Dan and Nate.
Okay.
Find me? I'm right here.
Dan! And Vanessa.
Hey, Serena.
Nate.
Juliet.
Hi.
Hi. Nice to meet you.
Hey, Serena.
Rufus and... Baby?
This is Milo. He's my son.
Son?
You saw me four months ago.
If you thought I was pregnant,
then I'm offended.
Okay, is someone gonna help fill me in?
Not it.
Yeah, I-I-I will explain everything.
Just, uh, just sit down. I gotta get him a bottle.
Uh, I'll get it.
With Dan spotted kissing Vanessa
and Nate's early morning coffees with a new blonde,
It looks like the oddsmakers have taken a beating.
Serena van der woodsen
will be walking onto Columbia's campus single.
This poll is now closed,
and nobody won.
DID YOU CHOOSE?
THEY CHOOSE FIRST.
So when I grabbed your hand back there, you seemed to like it.
Was that just a part of the act,
or do I actually have a shot at a date?
You've been over Serena for, like, seven minutes.
You're not ready for me yet.
And when I am?
You know how to find me.
Just as every summer ends,
all tourists come home, all dreamers wake up,
and new problems are born.
What's all this?
Oh, it was laying around the nursery.
I thought I'd put it into a baby book for Dan.
That's a good idea. Oh, is this Milo's hospital bracelet?
Yeah. Look how tiny his wrist was.
Huh. Either this is a mistake or...
Or what?
Milo's bracelet says his blood type is o-negative.
That's a universal donor. That's not common.
Rufus, enough conspiracy theories.
Look, the closest you've been to medical school
is having a lincoln hawk song licensed for "Chicago hope."
When Dan got his appendix out as a kid,
I banked some blood just in case something went wrong.
He's a.B.-Positive, same as me.
Okay, so Georgina is type o.
I'm sure she is. Likely, so is Milo's real father.
And just like that,
A pretty girl's ugly secret is revealed.
I had to improvise, but it's done.
I'll see you soon, and we'll talk about what's next.
Take care. Hang in there.
I miss you.
When you didn't come home last night,
I assumed you'd left with that girl.
I owe you an apology.
I don't expect you to understand, but where I'm from,
people lie and cheat and destroy whoever gets in their way.
I did it better than any of them.
When you dragged me in from the alley,
You didn't just save my life.
You gave me the hope of a new one.
Well, the you I've been living with
never did anything to be ashamed of.
I hope...
I hope you'll bring some of him with you back to your world.
I fully intend to...
if you'll come with me.
To New York?
You got me a ticket?
We don't need tickets.
I'm Chuck Bass.
But no matter what the new season brings,
We'll always have Paris.
