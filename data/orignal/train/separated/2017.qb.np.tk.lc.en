i lost ava her company .
i assume my deal with edward is dead .
as long as you win her murder trial ,
you &apos;ll be the next managing partner .
i &apos;m sleeping with stephen .
i can see that .
so you &apos;re not upset ?
no .
i got an interview .
look , i &apos;m sorry , i just didn &apos;t know how to tell you , mike .
i don &apos;t know , how about ,
&quot; hey , mike , i might go to law school 3,000 miles away &quot; ?
this isn &apos;t about me getting personal with gianopolous .
this is about me getting personal with donna .
chain of custody is something i know a little bit about ,
thanks to you .
save yourself the embarrassment
and cancel this trial .
we &apos;re in the ring , i &apos;m still standing ,
and this isn &apos;t done .
it &apos;s going up on the wall tomorrow .
and this is your way of getting me on your side ?
i don &apos;t want you on my side .
i want us to be on the same side .
you look happy .
do i ?
why ?
um , i don &apos;t know , donna , it &apos;s hard to explain .
all right , i &apos;ll tell you .
mikado finally slept in my bed last night ,
and when i woke up this morning ,
it felt like the whole world was hugging me .
i lost 9 ounces .
my teeth whiteners are working .
i found five new hairs on the top of my head .
and to top it all off , i just found out
that esther broke her foot in three places .
your sister ?
yeah , crutches for seven months .
serves her right . dad &apos;s favorite .
i need a day .
dom perignon &apos;s on ice
and bloomberg &apos;s closing broadway
for the ticker @-@ tape parade .
you saw the sign ?
yeah , dream come true for any lawyer .
i don &apos;t have dreams . i have goals .
now it &apos;s on to the next one .
when did you find out ?
last night .
why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
i shouldn &apos;t have to .
meaning ?
meaning your focus hasn &apos;t been where it usually is .
okay , meaning that my focus has been on stephen .
if that &apos;s what you mean , then just say it .
just admit that it bothers you about me and him .
i &apos;m not admitting anything
because there &apos;s nothing to admit .
and stephen or not , you know as well as i do
i &apos;ve never had to tell you a thing .
you &apos;ve always just known .
you &apos;ve had too much coffee .
what are you talking about ?
after two cups , your signature slants .
after three , it scrawls .
and after four , it &apos;s chicken scratch .
they &apos;re not gonna accept these .
you &apos;re crazy .
how many cups have you had today ?
five .
how &apos;d you do that ?
it &apos;s what i do .
i read , i analyze , i fix .
bullshit .
you &apos;re wearing a blue shirt ,
which means you won big in poker last night .
you missed a spot shaving ,
which means you had less than five hours of sleep .
and your left wrist ,
which you claim you sprained playing basketball ,
still hasn &apos;t healed because your loud tie is hanging
ever so slightly to the left .
loud , by the way , because you won big in poker last night .
for your information ,
i didn &apos;t lose sleep just because of poker .
yeah , you did .
melanie &apos;s not in the picture anymore .
you knew about melanie ?
and charlotte .
and nadia .
okay , i don &apos;t want you working for me anymore .
harvey , stop playing footsie with your secretary .
mackenzie brothers are here .
we need to get these assholes to cave .
i had an idea . nite owl murders .
we &apos;re not using an idea you got from l.a. confidential .
how is that different from you shooting a dead guy
just because sean connery did it the untouchables ?
what are you prepared to do ?
is that supposed to be sean connery ?
don &apos;t even think that you can do connery better than me .
junior .
he &apos;s a lying member
of a no @-@ good race .
ease up , james bond .
so you gonna come out and say it ?
say what ?
all those observations .
you &apos;re into me .
i &apos;m not into you . i &apos;m donna .
what &apos;s that supposed to mean ?
it means i could do the same thing with bertha
that i did with you .
all that means is that you &apos;re into bertha too .
ooh , what if i am ?
we can have a threesome .
trust me , if you were ever lucky enough to have me ,
you wouldn &apos;t want to share .
dude , you gonna share that shit with me or what ?
negatory .
all right , you can have some , but take it easy .
it &apos;s gotta last until tomorrow .
i thought you had 3 ounces .
i sold it . daddy &apos;s gotta eat .
wait a minute , you &apos;re dealing now ?
friends and family , asshole .
what are you , at &amp; t ?
what are you , the fcc ?
you don &apos;t even know what that is .
yes , i do .
really ?
tell me what they do . i &apos;ll give you $ 500 .
you &apos;re a dick .
a dick who just got a hundred on his calc midterm .
you got the results back already ?
no , but trust me , hundred .
you know who else thinks you &apos;re a dick ?
that math test .
well , that &apos;s fine , because i just made it my bitch .
up top , mother flecker !
whoa , you &apos;re gonna leave me hanging ?
like you &apos;re gonna leave me hanging ?
you got into harvard , dickhead .
they accepted my transfer ?
yeah , they did .
holy goddamn shit .
wait a minute , you read my mail ?
what &apos;s the point of going through it
if i &apos;m not gonna read it ?
i hate you .
yeah , mother flecker !
holy shit , dude .
we gotta celebrate .
those douche bags over at a.e. pi are having a party .
it &apos;s on .
it &apos;s still on .
there &apos;s a reason cameron hasn &apos;t raised the white flag
with ava yet .
what is it ?
i was filing our motion to dismiss
when i noticed his office faxed the court
from the waldorf astoria .
he &apos;s been booking rooms all over manhattan .
and turns out two days ago ,
he also called in the u.s. marshals .
protective custody .
20 men strong .
shit .
this case isn &apos;t over .
he &apos;s got another goddamn witness .
rachel , come on . let &apos;s just sit dowm
for ten minutes , please . this is ridiculous .
i can &apos;t . i don &apos;t wanna miss my flight .
you &apos;re not gonna miss your flight .
it doesn &apos;t leave for another three hours .
and you &apos;re supposed to be there two hours before ,
and the airport &apos;s an hour away .
and you know what , instead of giving me a hard time
about my travel habits ,
it &apos;d be nice if you &apos;d just come with me to the airport .
rachel , you know the case i &apos;m working on ,
you know the deadline , and you know the stakes .
what i know is you don &apos;t want me to visit stanford
because you don &apos;t want me to go to stanford .
i never said that .
i just said i wish you had told me that you had applied .
well , i did , and now you &apos;re being shity
because you don &apos;t want me to go ,
and you won &apos;t even just admit it .
look , do you really want this to be easy for me ?
all i wanted is for you to tell me
to have a good trip and to mean it .
have a good trip .
okay , you &apos;re telling me that if i can guess
your exact birthday , you will kiss me right here .
if you can guess my birthday ,
i &apos;ll kiss you ...
that is very detailed .
all right , i &apos;m ready to get started .
uh , i need 360--
i &apos;m sorry , i gotta borrow my friend here .
i need to borrow my friend just for a second .
no , no , trevor , &apos; cause we &apos;re right in the middle of a thing .
i &apos;m doing the birthday thing . what are you doing ?
i just found out behind that door over there
is a poker game filled with drunk a.e. pi brothers .
no way ! yeah , that &apos;s a great idea .
i should totally not pursue this hot girl .
dude , whatever , you &apos;re always telling me
you &apos;re mr. rounders .
let &apos;s go take their money .
come on , we &apos;re here to drink booze
and hit on chicks ,
not sit in the dark and play with a bunch of dudes .
come on , now where was--
what ?
totally not cool , man .
of her or of you ?
whatever .
whoa , hey , excuse me .
our house , our rules , asshole .
douche bag .
man , forget him .
nah , i can &apos;t .
first week freshman year , i was playing basketball .
he showed up with three of his buddies .
i go up for a lay @-@ up ,
he comes in , lays me out .
stands over me and says ,
&quot; what are you gonna do about it ? &quot;
i let it go .
i &apos;m not letting it go this time .
let &apos;s roll .
you wanted to see me ?
mackenzie brothers .
i got &apos; em 25 years apiece .
you ?
you wouldn &apos;t have gotten shit without me .
nite owl murders , baby .
oh , don &apos;t do that .
what kind of person doesn &apos;t high @-@ five another person ?
a person who &apos;s not ten years old .
oh , so you mean like a dick .
no , i mean , like the guy that can fire you on the spot .
nite owl murders , baby .
all right , okay , okay .
all kidding aside , great job .
thank you .
that &apos;s not why i called you down here .
look , harvey ,
you &apos;re killing it , and you &apos;ve been killing it ,
and i think it &apos;s time that you got rewarded for it .
head litigator .
look , i know you got a deal with jessica to come back ,
but i &apos;m telling you , in ten years , you could be me .
you think about it .
in the meantime , celebrate the win .
just stay away from my scotch .
well , i guess i win again .
you guys are really behind the times .
you ought to be playing hold &apos;em .
don &apos;t give a shit about moneymaker
and his bullshit game .
we &apos;re old school . we play stud .
you lose at stud .
not to you , asshole .
no , no , no , no , you lose to me .
come on , hurry up , old school . deal the cards .
compliments of cameron dennis .
harvey , this isn &apos;t just winning a case .
this is head litigator .
scotch isn &apos;t good enough .
we need , like , a ritual or something .
what did you have in mind ?
i don &apos;t know .
i have an idea .
i &apos;m listening .
it &apos;s not something a gentleman should say out loud .
oh , well , then i &apos;m willing to pretend
that you &apos;re a gentleman .
okay , you are definitely not a gentleman .
what would we even do it with ?
whipped cream .
enough about this conversation .
i want to revisit our earlier one .
this is our earlier one .
come on , you know you &apos;ve thought about it .
yeah , i think about a lot of things .
and you would .
but i won &apos;t .
you &apos;re afraid you &apos;d fall for me .
oh , please , if anybody &apos;s falling for anybody ,
it would be you for me .
sounds like a challenge .
one you are never gonna get to take .
why not ?
&apos;cause i don &apos;t get involved with men that i work with .
okay , then you &apos;re fired .
&apos;bout time .
what did i ever do to you ?
nothing . i get your chair .
bertha , what are you doing here so late ?
don &apos;t get all up in my business
just because i interrupted you hitting on red .
how do you know i &apos;m hitting on her ?
two glasses of scotch and you .
i found a mackenzie file in the macallister box .
you &apos;re welcome .
and you better get dennis his scotch back .
he won &apos;t like that .
shit .
what &apos;s wrong ?
we left out a piece of discovery .
will it screw us ?
it just did .
well , i raise .
500 .
call and raise another 500 .
i don &apos;t have another 500 , so ...
wait a second . he might .
i have another thousand on me .
how do you have another thousand ?
from the weed .
i told you , i got rid of it .
now do you have this guy or not ?
i got kings full of 2s .
he &apos;s got no aces showing ,
and jesus christ superstar folded one on first street .
the only way he beats me
is with trip 3s or trip 4s under there ,
and limp bizkit folded two 3s ,
and dickcheese over here had a 4 .
so he &apos;s got a ...
a traight .
straight .
or he &apos;s bluffing ,
but either way , i got him .
hey , do you always get your girlfriend &apos;s advice on everything ?
oh , this guy .
well , let &apos;s raise another 500 .
don &apos;t ask for more unless you wanna lose it .
call .
full house .
four 4s , asshole .
whoa , wait , wait , that &apos;s not possible .
he had--
he &apos;s cheating .
and what are you gonna do about it ?
you &apos;re not gonna get away with this .
well , i guess your only option
would be to call the police .
of course , i haven &apos;t been drinking ,
&apos;cause , you know , i &apos;m underage , like you boys .
you set us up .
yeah .
see , i remember you .
first week , you come into class ,
mr. &quot; oh , i got the whole textbook memorized . &quot;
made the rest of us look like chumps .
no , you did that all by yourself .
yeah , well , i don &apos;t need a super brain
to remember some guy who thinks his shit don &apos;t stink .
whoa , whoa , whoa , dude .
hey , back up .
now get the hell outta here
before we put you out of here .
congradulations , harvey
i &apos;d no idea jessica was planning this .
what do you want , stephen ?
i hear cameron got a witness .
he did . what do you want ?
i &apos;m just checking to see if there &apos;s anything i can do to help .
there isn &apos;t .
cheers .
what do you got ?
i couldn &apos;t find out where cameron &apos;s got his witness hidden ,
but i figured out who it is .
what ?
so now i know why you wanted to meet me at the elevator .
pretty awesome .
yeah , it is .
what are you gonna do about jessica ?
i don &apos;t know .
nothing ever changes around here .
it &apos;s good to see you too , harvey .
now what was so important that you just had to see me ?
i wanna talk to you about extending my time at the d.a. &apos; s office .
come with me .
now what &apos;s cameron dennis offering you ?
why does he have to be offering me something ?
because he knows , if you wanna keep someone in your house ,
offer them a better room .
head litigator .
do you wanna stay there because it &apos;s a step up
or because you can see yourself there in ten years ?
why do you wanna know ?
because i have a promotion ready for you right here .
what are you talking about ?
daniel hardman and i
are taking gordon , schmidt , and van dyke down .
that &apos;s why we &apos;re up here .
did you think we were gonna make out ?
man can hope .
what ?
are you sure you wanna take control in the night ?
nighttime &apos;s when they &apos;re sleeping .
telling them you &apos;re coming shows them respect .
not telling them shows them more .
what about honor ?
harvey , we &apos;re lawyers .
we &apos;re not in the honor business .
what did i always tell you when you were here ?
don &apos;t judge a man till you &apos;ve walked a mile in his shoes .
well , if you &apos;re ever in these babies ,
we &apos;ll see if you feel the same way .
it &apos;s a little early for batting cages , don &apos;t you think ?
i &apos;m not going to the batting cages , and you know it .
trevor , let it go .
i can &apos;t . i need that money back .
what did you do ?
i haven &apos;t paid for the weed yet .
you took a loan from a drug dealer ?
it &apos;s called consignment .
did you ever learn about free enterprise in econ 1a ?
no , but i read about not betting money i don &apos;t have
in econ 1a .
you told me you had him , smart guy .
i did have him , and you know i did .
well , i need a thousand dollars by monday ,
or omar &apos;s gonna beat the living shit outta me .
trevor , him kicking your ass doesn &apos;t get him his money any faster .
he &apos;s not gonna see it that way .
okay , then we will think of something else .
i &apos;ve been thinking ,
and the only thing i came up with you &apos;re not gonna like .
why do i have to like it ?
because i can &apos;t do it .
i told you before , i &apos;m not selling any test answers .
it &apos;s not any test . it &apos;s the test you just aced .
it &apos;s not out there yet . nobody has it .
i can make us 1,000 bucks in one shot .
tell me you haven &apos;t memorized
every question and every answer , harvard boy .
that &apos;s what this is about , isn &apos;t it ?
so what if it is ?
look , you &apos;re bolting ,
and you &apos;re using your brain to do it .
i &apos;m just asking ,
before you go , use it to help me .
please .
what the hell is this ?
it &apos;s the paperwork for the mackenzie deal .
type it up and get it out .
no , that report was supposed to be disclosed
during discovery .
if you type up what i gave you ,
you &apos;d know i &apos;m disclosing it now .
no , you &apos;re sticking it in there now
as if it &apos;s always been there .
it &apos;s called bluffing , okay ,
it &apos;s what i do .
that &apos;s how i got the confession in the first place .
it &apos;s called bullshit ,
it &apos;s what bullshitters do ,
and it &apos;s how innocent people
sometimes end up in prison .
watch yourself .
excuse me ?
that toxicology report
doesn &apos;t change the fact that those two assholes killed that woman .
and you being an asshole to me
doesn &apos;t change the fact that you are breaking the law .
i &apos;m not breaking the law .
i put the goddamn thing in there .
they can find it
if they can think to look .
harvey , you are making a huge--
that &apos;s enough !
i &apos;m here .
you &apos;re here .
do your job .
we know you have a witness .
surprised it took you that long .
and we know who it is .
the man from the video , colonel mariga .
i don &apos;t have any prizes ,
so you &apos;ll just have to accept a pat on the back .
that &apos;s okay , tom selleck ,
i don &apos;t need a pat on the back .
i just need to know what bullshit story he &apos;s gonna tell in court .
it &apos;s not bullshit .
he &apos;s gonna say that ava hessington
paid him to kill those people .
we &apos;re getting access to him .
no , you &apos;re not , because i &apos;m gonna say
if she finds out where he is ,
what &apos;s to stop her from killing him too ?
you &apos;re not gonna bribe him , you &apos;re not gonna threaten him ,
and you &apos;re not gonna talk him out of it ,
because you &apos;re not gonna see him until he gets on the stand .
but what i will do
is allow you to take an offer to your client .
15 years , no parole .
you &apos;re bluffing .
he &apos;s not gonna say she knew about the murders ,
because she didn &apos;t .
i &apos;ll tell you what .
ten years with parole .
ah , make it nine .
after all , we used to work together .
how &apos;d it go ?
no
was she hot ?
i sold her a math test for $ 1,000 .
i wasn &apos;t thinking of whether she was hot or not .
okay , i get it , so , like , an eight ?
no , a ten wouldn &apos;t even do her justice .
so six .
mm , she &apos;s a four .
but she paid me $ 1,000,
so i bumped her up to a ten .
got it .
thank you , michael . came through .
not yet .
i &apos;m coming with you to omar &apos;s .
no , no , no , no , you can &apos;t .
yes , i can .
what &apos;s going on ?
i owed him the money yesterday .
how could you not tell me that ?
because i couldn &apos;t make the test thing happen until today .
i didn &apos;t want you freaking out .
well , i &apos;m definitely coming with you now ,
and the only way you can stop me is with that bat .
you wanted to see me ?
what the hell is this ?
it &apos;s the mackenzie file--
i know what it is .
what the hell did you put in the fine print ?
you too ?
you &apos;re gonna give me shit about not disclosing this report ?
not disclosing it ?
you gave it to &apos; em on a silver platter .
i don &apos;t understand . you want me to take it out ?
i don &apos;t want you to do shit .
i &apos;ve already taken it out .
and if i &apos;d wanted it disclosed ,
i wouldn &apos;t have misfiled it in the first place .
you buried it ?
damn right i did .
cameron ,
look , i &apos;m all for skirting the law ,
but this is breaking the law .
so was killing that woman ,
and i &apos;m not gonna let those two assholes walk
because our eyewitness
had a few beers at the ball game .
they won &apos;t walk .
that &apos;s why i put it in the fine print .
you think you &apos;re the first guy to have this idea ?
nobody does it because it doesn &apos;t work .
well , that &apos;s exactly why it can work .
they won &apos;t think to look at it
because nobody has the balls to do it .
and what if they do ?
and these guys get out
and they murder your brother
or your father or your cousin ?
&apos;cause i &apos;ll tell you right now ,
they &apos;re gonna murder someone &apos;s .
i don &apos;t feel comfortable with this .
i don &apos;t give a shit whether you feel comfortable or not .
this is my case .
we &apos;re not disclosing it . it &apos;s done .
cameron--
i told you this before . don &apos;t make me tell you again .
i &apos;m here .
you &apos;re here .
do your job .
keep the change .
i need to speak with you .
okay , let &apos;s talk on the way up .
no , i prefer to speak out here .
i know that cameron &apos;s offered harvey a deal .
all right , i &apos;m not going behind harvey &apos;s back .
i don &apos;t want you to go behind his back .
i want you to go to his face .
and do what ?
it wasn &apos;t a deal . it was an insult .
it was an opening .
now he wouldn &apos;t have offered anything
if he wasn &apos;t willing to negotiate .
maybe we can get him down to five years .
that &apos;s exactly what he wants ,
to put ava in a position
where she has to choose between five years and life .
that &apos;s a better position than she &apos;s in now .
he wouldn &apos;t have offered anything at all
if he wasn &apos;t bluffing .
we &apos;re not gonna fall for that bluff .
well , then harvey &apos;s making a mistake .
then take it up with harvey .
you know as well as i do
harvey is not interested in anything i &apos;ve got to say at the moment .
you think harvey &apos;s making this call
because of what &apos;s going on between you and donna ?
it &apos;s clouding his judgment .
not about this .
right now harvey cannot see reason with respect to cameron .
he can &apos;t hear reason with respect to me .
now you have a chance to convince him to make a deal , mike .
put yourself in ava hessington &apos;s shoes .
would you want that choice or not ?
okay , whatever happens ,
just be quiet and be cool .
okay .
who this ?
my friend .
hi .
inside .
don &apos;t move .
where &apos;s omar ?
that &apos;s omar .
how is that omar ?
he &apos;s obsessed with the wire .
are you kidding me ? come on .
i &apos;m telling you , he &apos;s no joke .
yeah , well , i know i &apos;m supposed to be scared ,
but i &apos;m really not .
don &apos;t touch anything .
now unless my calendar is messed up ,
today be monday .
omar ...
shut up !
okay , i &apos;m trying to decide why i shouldn &apos;t call
a couple of hard , pipe @-@ hitting negroes
to come and work on you
with a pair of pliers and a blowtorch .
i &apos;m--i &apos;m sorry , omar .
i don &apos;t have a reason ,
but i think the word you be looking for
isn &apos;t &quot; negro . &quot;
if you &apos;re gonna quote pulp fiction ,
at least have the balls to quote pulp fiction .
omar ...
you know what they call a quarter pounder with cheese in france ?
a royale with cheese , mother flecker .
i love this negro !
trevor , you &apos;re off the hook .
never again .
this be for you .
not white boy .
go in peace .
oh , uh , okay .
thanks .
hey , thank you .
who touched my alien ?
what the hell is wrong with you ?
come on , it &apos;s nothing that some of this
and a royale with cheese can &apos;t fix .
you do not know what we just avoided .
just call me the wolf . i &apos;ll be over there directly .
oh , you sending the wolf ?
oh , shit , negro , that &apos;s all you had to say .
yo , put that away .
what ? put what away ?
if they find it , it &apos;s mine .
trevor evans ?
yes , officers .
come with us .
hey , what &apos;s going on ?
your friend here seems to be involved
in selling the answers to a stolen test .
the mackenzie deal came back .
two murderers down .
don &apos;t you wanna ask me if they saw the fine print ?
oh , no , of course you don &apos;t .
because you know they didn &apos;t
because that report wasn &apos;t in the fine print anymore .
donna--
cameron made you take it out , didn &apos;t he ?
how &apos;d you know ?
when i do my donna shit with you ,
it &apos;s not just for fun . it &apos;s my job .
now why don &apos;t you tell me why you didn &apos;t tell me ?
because you hated me when i was working in the gray .
this is the black .
i didn &apos;t hate you .
i was trying to stop you .
and the truth is what you were doing
was right on the line .
what he is making you do , that &apos;s illegal .
it &apos;s one time , and it &apos;s not my case .
it might not be your case ,
but it &apos;s definitely not just one time .
i was here all night going through his past cases .
how many ?
too many . and i &apos;ll tell you another thing .
i bet his first time he thought would be his last time .
donna .
if you want somebody to just sit at her desk ,
answer your phones , and pick up your dry cleaning ,
then put out a want ad , because that &apos;s not me .
i &apos;m gonna tell you what i think .
and what i think is , if you do this ,
you &apos;re gonna keep doing it .
donna , i need you to--
where the hell &apos;s donna ?
i don &apos;t know . i was waiting for her myself .
wait somewhere else .
harvey , listen ...
no , don &apos;t &quot; harvey &quot; me .
you went to my guy about my case behind my back .
so what you need to do now is stay out of my face .
they told me this is where i &apos;d find women &apos;s softball .
it is now .
all right , old man ,
stand back while i knock the cover off a few balls .
easy , reggie jackson .
i think you &apos;re maybe forgetting i hit 385 .
who doesn &apos;t hit at least 350 in high school ?
marcus didn &apos;t .
don &apos;t give your brother shit .
he &apos;s not here to defend himself .
pussy .
hey , if he &apos;s not here to defend himself ...
yeah , he &apos;s not here to hear it .
cheers .
so what &apos;s going on ?
i don &apos;t know what to do .
well , breaking the law isn &apos;t worth it
no matter what the guy did .
how &apos;d you know ?
you &apos;re a prosecutor . you told me you had a problem .
well , it &apos;s not that simple , dad .
it &apos;s not just me , and if i don &apos;t let it go ,
i &apos;ll get fired .
if you do ?
i tell him i &apos;m only doing this once ,
and i &apos;m only doing it because it &apos;s his case ,
and i &apos;ll never do it on one of mine .
and then i keep knocking the covers off the bad guys ,
which is what i do ,
and i don &apos;t bat 385 , i bat a thousand .
all right .
you know , i &apos;m gonna tell you something
i never told you before .
you might not wanna hear it now ,
but you know what your grandmother said to me
when i told her i was gonna ask your mother to marry me ?
what ?
don &apos;t , because if she &apos;ll cheat on someone else with you ,
she &apos;ll cheat on you with someone else .
we had a huge blowout .
i told her to shove it up her ass .
lily wouldn &apos;t do that .
she &apos;d be different with me because lily loved me .
dad ...
no , no , let me finish .
then , years later ,
i found out the other guy thought the same thing .
what i &apos;m trying to say is ,
even if cameron believes
that he &apos;ll never make you do it again ,
he will .
okay , out with it . drop the hammer .
they know trevor isn &apos;t in the class ,
so they know he couldn &apos;t have been the one to steal the test .
and they won &apos;t expel him if he gives you up .
how do you know that ?
i watch law &amp; order . i &apos;m not an idiot .
he &apos;ll never turn me in .
but you feel guilty .
i am guilty .
so you wanna turn yourself in ?
they &apos;ll fail me .
but i still have a 3.8 .
you know , there &apos;s no way harvard rescinds my acceptance .
that goddamn kid .
i guess i know where you come down on this .
oh , he &apos;s an asshole in the making ,
no question about it .
but ?
after you lost your mom and dad ,
the evans &apos; offered to take you in .
they offered because that little boy
cried all night for a month .
he begged them .
i &apos;m not saying he &apos;s the same kid anymore ,
but that kid is in there .
harvey , just the man i wanted to see .
why is that ?
&apos;cause i wanted you to be the first to know .
i &apos;m looking at my new head litigator .
i &apos;m afraid you &apos;re not .
and why is that ?
because after i show you this , you &apos;re gonna demand this .
you disclosed that report .
that affidavit says i made a mistake ,
an honest mistake .
and this one says , as my penance ,
i &apos;m resigning .
so you &apos;re just gonna put two killers back on the street .
if you &apos;re half the prosecutor you say you are ,
you can still put them away .
and i don &apos;t give a shit
whether you feel comfortable with that or not ,
because you said it was your case ,
but you made it my case .
i made it our case ,
because i thought you were about putting bad guys behind bars .
cameron , you asked what if they got out
and killed my father ?
well , i think the question is :
what if my father found out what i did to put them in ?
you goddamn pussy .
the only thing that makes me a pussy
is that i didn &apos;t send that affidavit in
the second i found out .
sir , i know you offered trevor evans
a way to avoid expulsion .
well , the reason he didn &apos;t take it is he was trying ...
he was trying to protect me .
he &apos;s the one who sold the test ,
but i &apos;m the one who took it .
so please ,
do not punish him for his loyalty to me .
truth is , with the way his grades are ,
i don &apos;t think it &apos;ll matter anyway .
so i &apos;ll tell you what ,
i &apos;m not going to expel your friend .
oh , thank you , sir .
there &apos;s just one thing .
you &apos;re his roommate .
and you scored perfectly on that test .
i knew it was you .
i also know you &apos;re only sitting here in front of my face
because you think whatever i do to you won &apos;t matter .
no , sir , that &apos;s not true .
well , let me tell you what is true ,
you little piece of shit .
the young woman you sold the test to was my daughter .
they &apos;re demanding my resignation .
and as my last official act ,
i &apos;m expelling you from this school .
and then i &apos;m gonna call harvard .
believe me when i tell you ,
you &apos;re never going there .
i decided what kind of attorney i want to be .
i heard . you quit .
did you hear i also turned over the toxicology report ?
you didn &apos;t .
thought you were supposed to know everything .
how &apos;d you not know this ?
well , i knew that you were either gonna take that promotion
or you were gonna quit .
and either way , i wasn &apos;t sticking around to find out .
you quit ?
damn straight .
i &apos;m not working at a place headed by a viper .
donna , i can &apos;t get you another job .
oh , well , that &apos;s gonna make my decision easier .
what does that mean ?
i &apos;m choosing between bratton gould ,
skadden arps , and o &apos;melveny &amp; myers .
if i had another one , i don &apos;t know what i &apos;d do .
you know , it just occurred to me
that you and i don &apos;t work together anymore .
yeah , that didn &apos;t just occur to you .
no , it didn &apos;t .
do you know how i know that ?
&apos;cause you knew i &apos;d show up here
the second you heard i quit ?
why do you think i have this in my hand ?
what are we waiting for ?
for you to figure out that it &apos;s time to come inside .
so let me get this straight .
you turned me down before ,
and now you &apos;re saying you want to come back ?
yes .
and it has nothing to do with our coup ?
i didn &apos;t even know you did it
until i saw your name on the wall .
you got it up there fast .
don &apos;t tell them you &apos;re coming , and slam the door behind them .
now why should i take someone who waited for me to win ?
because i &apos;m someone you trusted with the news in the first place .
i also trusted all the people who voted for me .
come clean , harvey . what changed your mind ?
instead of thinking about what i wanna be doing in ten years ,
i started thinking about who i want to be doing it with .
me over him .
terms are nonnegotiable .
you get what i give you .
fine by me , but i &apos;m getting my own secretary .
associates don &apos;t get their own secretaries .
this isn &apos;t about the associate .
it &apos;s about the secretary .
and i &apos;m not coming here without her .
she must be very special .
she is .
difference comes out of your pocket .
as long as she never knows .
welcome back , harvey .
you start monday .
give it up .
oh , no .
so what was so important
that you just had to see me ?
i don &apos;t know how to say it ,
so i &apos;m just gonna come out and say it .
but ... i don &apos;t want to lose you .
come work for me .
what ?
don &apos;t go to skadden .
i took a job at my old firm .
i was hoping you &apos;d be happy .
we--i am .
if this is about your rule--
no , it &apos;s not about that .
because if i had known that this was gonna happen ,
i never would have come over .
why didn &apos;t you know that it was gonna happen ?
because i hadn &apos;t thought about taking another job before .
and when i did ...
i thought about who i wanted to take it with .
look , i don &apos;t wanna find out what kind of lawyer
i &apos;d be without you .
okay , i will come work with you on two conditions .
first , we put it out of our minds ,
and we never mention it again .
second ?
you &apos;re giving me a huge goddamn signing bonus .
how do you know that &apos;s enough ?
because you &apos;re the one who &apos;s gonna fill in the amount .
oh , my god , you really do need me ...
to stop you from doing shit like this .
oh , well ...
in the future .
what ?
we &apos;re gonna need a new ritual .
well , maybe we can think of something to do with a can opener .
harvey , that &apos;s the dumbest thing i &apos;ve ever heard .
jeez .
actually ...
what are you doing here , harvey ?
it &apos;s 7 : 00 a.m.
i didn &apos;t know you were gonna be here .
i love this place .
really ?
you &apos;ve only ever been here once before .
how &apos;d you know that ?
i know .
you and stephen , it bothers me .
i know it &apos;s not fair , but it does .
good .
what do you mean , good ?
i mean , we both knew it .
it &apos;s good that you finally were able to say it .
you realize just because it bothers me ,
it doesn &apos;t mean that i want us to be--
i know .
jeez .
you know this is exactly why i had that policy .
well , then why did you change it ?
because i have to live my life , harvey .
i &apos;ve never apologized for who i am ,
and i &apos;m not gonna start now .
you don &apos;t need to apologize for anything .
i know .
but you do .
for taking so long to say that it bothered you .
jesus .
and let &apos;s just put an order in
for the valet to hold my suit jackets ,
and then we can--
harvey .
louis .
what are you doing here ?
you &apos;re not due back
for another two years , three months , and five days ,
not that i &apos;m keeping track .
change of plans . i &apos;m back today .
who &apos;s your girlfriend ?
oh , i &apos;m not his girlfriend .
i &apos;m his girl friday .
associates don &apos;t get secretaries .
i &apos;m not like other associates ,
and she &apos;s not like other secretaries .
bullshit .
donna ?
okay , listen , rain man , you wear lifts in your shoes ,
you want braces , but you don &apos;t have the balls ,
and you have a cat
that you love more than it loves you .
good to see you , louis .
i need a day .
you going down ?
all the way up , asshole .
i &apos;ll take the ride .
what &apos;s that ?
this is my way of showing you
that no matter what you choose ,
i support you .
and if your dream is to go to stanford ,
then that &apos;s my dream for you too .
how does it look ?
i have to admit , it looks pretty good .
so what changed your mind ?
you got into harvard ?
it &apos;s a-- it &apos;s a long story ,
but i have to go right now .
i wanted to be here when you got home .
but if you let me ,
i &apos;d like to come straight back here
and tell you the whole thing .
okay .
okay .
any progress getting to mariga ?
cameron &apos;s not just bluffing
about what mariga &apos;s gonna say .
he doesn &apos;t even have him .
that means we--
we win . it &apos;s over .
ah , it &apos;s gonna be fun telling cameron that .
it &apos;s gonna be fun for mike .
i &apos;ve got something else to do ,
and it &apos;s not gonna be fun .
is that why we &apos;re up here ?
you remember when you told me you decided
to take gordon , schmidt , and van dyke down ?
i guess that is why we &apos;re up here .
you said , take them in the night
because nighttime &apos;s when they &apos;re sleeping .
and you thought i was wrong .
and then you said if i were ever in your shoes ,
i might think differently .
what &apos;d you do , harvey ?
i made a move in the night .
i get ava hessington acquitted ...
darby backs me for managing partner .
i guess congratulations are in order .
i &apos;m here to tell you i don &apos;t want it anymore .
get out of my sight .
you look ready to attack .
does harvey know his puppy &apos;s off his leash ?
harvey said he didn &apos;t need to waste a trip down here
just for me to tell you i have my eye on the ball .
i &apos;m afraid i don &apos;t follow you .
mariga .
you weren &apos;t lying about what he would say .
you were lying about having him in the first place .
this whole thing was designed just to get us
to sign your bullshit deal .
you &apos;re right .
we didn &apos;t have him , but we do now ,
and he &apos;s on a flight as we speak .
so you do me a favor , and you tell harvey
he can take that bullshit deal and shove it up his ass ,
&apos;cause we &apos;re going to trial .
no way .
you didn &apos;t have mariga yesterday , you don &apos;t have him today .
why don &apos;t you ask your friend stephen huntley ?
he &apos;s the one that led me right to him .
&quot; the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the one . &quot;
what philosopher said that ?
spock .
you didn &apos;t fix this , you broke it wide open .
you acted on you own , and we know it .
are you going after him bacause he sold ava out
or because harvey sold you out ?
he &apos;s your guy , you &apos;re allying with him .
i trusted you .
you lied to me .
from stephen huntley &apos;s london office , one phone call .
i &apos;m so sorry , harvey .
suits , an all new episode next tuesday at 10 .
only on usa .
