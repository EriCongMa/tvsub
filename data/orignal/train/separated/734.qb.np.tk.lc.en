we march at nightfall , and by dawn &apos;s light ,
see an end to spartacus .
the signal .
glaber ?
again !
fall back into the tunnel .
move , move !
the mountain path , hurry !
we &apos;ll be trapped .
there &apos;s no choice . we must move !
you will let them go free ?
no , we shall kill them all .
第十集
the wood for fire is almost gone .
our food quickly follows .
we have stripped the mountain of what little it had
ever since glaber forced us upon it .
a thing that should not have happened .
you will find a way to see us from this .
you always do .
as you always find words ,
to pull me from darkest thoughts .
a talent i pray your next woman holds .
spartacus !
nemetes and a clutch of fools have taken a foot .
towards what purpose ?
they attempt to breach the romans at the foot of the path .
give word next time .
be mistaken as enemy .
glaber summons you .
we only just finished dining on the most succulent lamb .
there may yet be few scraps left .
you overstep , ...
slave .
i but place foot where our praetor commands .
if you do not care for where it falls , ...
you are free to take issue .
i do not know your tongue .
nor have cause to learn it .
pull back !
go ! move !
spartacus !
mira !
we must go !
mira !
we must seal her wound !
nasir ! heat your sword in the fire !
quickly !
spartacus ...
was it worth it ?
was it worth ... her life ,
to make attempt to save your own ? !
stay your fucking ground .
she is gone from this world cause of you !
you are the mad fuck that led us to our deaths !
at least she claimed hers as a warrior .
not starving and robbed of strength ,
as the rest of us are doomed .
you are right .
we will all perish .
if we do not stand together .
it will make no fucking difference .
seize tongue , and open fucking ears .
the cliffs of vesuvius are impassable .
the southern path holds the only promise of making purchase .
we hold the higher ground ,
and with it advantage over superior numbers .
only if glaber is foolish enough to attack .
before we are too weak from hunger to fight .
a man is never too weak ...
or too wounded to fight .
if the cause is greater than his own life .
glaber and his army will come .
and when they do ,
vesuvius will be forever stained ...
with the blood of vengeance .
he is all that was captured ?
several more lay dead .
a fortunate thing you are not among them .
had that egyptian and i not been present ,
i fear position would have been overrun .
the gods favor us then .
and turn from those who would do us harm .
tell me of spartacus , ...
and his thoughts toward coming storm .
can he form proper words ?
he has yet to break them .
a most unpleasant tongue .
conditions must be dire ,
to abandon the higher ground and attempt at such foolish act .
one that did not appear commanded by spartacus .
you laid eyes upon the man ?
briefly , as he and his ... shits gave opportunities for others to retreat .
how did he appear ?
deadly .
yet there was a look about eye .
one found reflected in wild beast ,
when pressed to corner .
such an animal ...
never greets the afterlife absent desperate blood .
vesuvius is not cere &apos;s horn ,
offering endless bounty .
there cannot be much in way of nourishment left upon barren peak .
we shall stay our hand yet a while longer .
and when hunger and despair
are the only tastes upon his lips ,
spartacus shall kneel before rome ...
for e final time .
we should not be upon road .
let us turn back .
no .
i will not sit idle in capua as weeks threaten unwelcome months .
all will soon come to an end .
i would see the day hastened .
and my child born in a city
befitting the heir of a praetor .
the glorious occasion is almost upon us .
to risk the journey to rome ...
there was yet time .
if my husband is moved to bring siege against spartacus
to early conclusion .
the reason we are for vesuvius .
a fraction of it .
the whole of the truth encompassing greater need .
has heart returned so fiercely in such regard ?
gaius and i share but one now .
his absence leaving chest but half filled .
to find yourself in the arms of a husband thought lost .
that &apos;s a blessing beyond measure .
a happiness i would share with a treasured friend .
you will come with me to rome .
i will entreat gaius towards dowry in honor of your service ,
and you shall again find comfort in title of wife .
your husband would not have me follow with you .
you have been invaluable to his cause .
he believes another more so .
i have been promised to ashur .
ashur ?
my hand and house , in payment
for blood spilled in your husband &apos;s name .
why have you not told me this ?
i would not have such thoughts weigh mind and body ,
with your day so close at hand .
i will seize opportunity at vesuvius ,
and attempt to rid myself of burden .
reveal intentions .
and see them embraced .
we sit here waiting to die , and he tends to fucking weeds .
he tends to his heart .
as any man should .
there is not enough wood to build a pyre .
the ground is too hard to lay her beneath it .
he can only grieve , and bind her in his cloak .
a blessing then .
that we shall all be dead before she turns overly ripe .
nemetes and his kind grow ever more restless .
i fear they &apos;re not alone .
i cannot lay blame .
yet our only chance of survival is to hold fast to sound tactic .
like attacking the arena with a handful of men ?
i once thought you reckless fool .
now i see bold strategy is the only reason
you &apos;re not already dead .
i have been but fortunate , to have--
seized opportunity the romans would consider mad .
there stand none left to us now ,
absent wings to fly from cliff .
the day comes when we must face glaber and his army
in open battle .
if i am to die ,
at least i shall die among brothers .
we share a bond .
forged not upon the sands ,
but upon grander stage of battle .
and when it ends ,
i will gain batiatus &apos;s ludus and villa as reward for loyal service .
it will become the noble house of ashur ,
where i shall train the mightiest gladiators
in all the republic .
i would count you among my first recruits .
i ask but for your oath , pledging --
open the gate !
wait here .
and see weighted heart lifted .
there has been no further movement ?
we have taught spartacus the futility of attempting breach .
you cannot school rabid dog not to bare teeth .
ilithyia !
you should not have come .
yes , i know , the rules .
women are forbidden in the encampment .
my concern is only for you , and the life you carry .
i would not have you travel in such condition .
i have never felt stronger .
and would ... travel a greater distance still .
you wish to return to rome .
with my husband beside me .
the rebels become desperate .
a few more weeks from starvation --
a few more weeks and your heir will be born
in a house tainted with blood and shit .
end spartacus &apos;s life .
and let us return home to ours .
he holds the higher ground .
it cannot be taken yet without severe loss of men .
yet ,
it can be taken ?
await me in capua .
and prepare to celebrate the birth of our child ...
in the arms of mother rome .
you truly stand a titan , threatening the very heavens .
go .
and know that you are in my thoughts .
i would linger but a moment longer .
what is this ?
a warning .
from the gods .
how did this come to you ?
i uncovered it while cleansing trace of seppia .
secreted among her things .
my slave amana recalls seeing it pressed into seppia &apos;s hands .
by the syrian toad .
that is how she knew her brother &apos;s true fate .
and why she moved against you .
but it holds no sense .
ashur &apos;s fortunes are tethered to my own .
he is a serpent ,
forever seeking the heat of power and position .
when yours was threatened by varinius ,
is it a wonder he sought to slither towards warmer clime ?
a venomous creature to the last .
one no longer holding worth .
he is not alone , in such regard .
serpents and oracle have both served purpose .
you speak of lucretia ?
i speak of a woman who knows secrets i would not have revealed .
you would ask me to do such a thing ?
i would put unfortunate past behind us ,
and seize glorious future .
i have missed your delicate scent ...
among other offerings of more personal nature .
it lifts spirits , to find you close again .
i stay but a moment .
a thing of low importance ,
when set against the promise of a lifetime
held in loving embrace .
will not shed tear when we part .
know that campaign soon draws to inevitable close .
and ashur to deserving reward .
i long to greet the day .
syrian .
do you think me the fool ?
praetor ?
i do not understand .
do you deny taking it ?
i take many things from the fallen .
i thought i had your blessing to do so .
and did you also seek seppia &apos;s blessing ,
before she made attempt on my life ?
seppia ?
i &apos;ve never broken words with the girl .
i have had my fill of serpent &apos;s tongue .
wait !
wait !
i do not know what you have been told ,
but i fear you have made a grave error .
now i fear you have made the error .
in attempting to maneuver beyond your station .
unfortunate end to profitable association .
perhaps it best my men and i quietly take leave ,
absent further disagreement .
oh i would make better offer .
land and a thousand denarii to each of you ,
in return for faithful service .
you fucking cunts .
hold .
you once swore to me .
&quot; your will , my hands .. &quot;
an oath that has not wavered !
i swear it to you , praetor !
i would test such vaunted words .
and the depths of your loyalty .
spartacus !
there &apos;s movement upon the path .
take position !
ashur !
i come bearing message from glaber !
speak it .
he has grown weary of this conflict .
and would return home to see his child born in rome .
a thing of no interest .
perhaps the lives of your people hold more .
he offers terms of surrender .
lay down your arms , you &apos;ll be allowed to live .
as slaves ?
beneath the heel of the republic ?
yes , as slaves .
yet you will have your lives !
refuse , and glaber has sworn torturous death
upon the cross for all
that survives the taking of the mountain !
and what of spartacus &apos;s life ?
the cost of the bargain .
i for one do not wish to die this day .
yet if it is to be fucking so ,
i shall do it as a free man !
fuck the romans !
no surrender !
syrian cunt !
you have your answer .
very well ...
i shall deliver it to waiting ears .
i would not have us part so quickly .
glaber awaits , i must return
with a reply .
your head would serve equal purpose .
spartacus ...
i find no fault with his reasoning .
the mighty crixus , forever intoning
of the honor of a gladiator .
where stands such now ,
in the cutting down of a defenseless man ?
give him a sword .
you once dreamt of honor upon the sand .
make this your final arena .
you stand a champion , and i gravely wounded .
there is yet no honor in such contest .
to shit with honor .
no .
i will not have you soil name ,
to gain vengeance in mine .
naevia ...
i shall take it myself .
no one has been more wronged by ashur .
and no one has greater claim on his fucking life .
i will see him fall .
and with him memories that haunt darkest nights .
see it done .
are you certain of this ?
i am far removed .
very well .
if ashur must die today ,
at least he will see crixus &apos;s bitch to the afterlife before him .
take his fucking head off !
delicate flower has grown thorns .
you can take him , naevia !
kill the cunt !
sharpened by the undefeated gaul .
i fear it will not help .
she fades .
as all beautiful things do .
naevia !
no !
he is mine .
stay back !
i will have his life for what he did to me .
or die in attempt !
go ! come on !
do you recall this ?
my body pressed against yours ?
you trembling helpless , as you tremble now --
i am far from helpless .
you think this makes difference ?
my death will not heal the scars you bear .
nor erase memory of my cock inside of her ,
or all those that followed .
no .
it will not .
but it is a fucking start .
you were right .
it is no easy task .
to cleave a man &apos;s head from his shoulders in a single blow .
then i will teach you .
donar ! lydon !
see ashur &apos;s head upon the path ,
as reply to glaber .
you send a clear one .
it will be nail and cross for those who live .
glaber would have seen us all to such fate ,
regardless of answer carried .
so we are dead either way .
pity there are not enough vines for all our corpses .
close fucking mouth .
no . nemetes is right .
there are not enough vines for us all .
and perhaps there &apos;s enough for a few .
your words carry no meaning .
glaber expects us to defend the higher ground ,
as any reasonable leader would .
yet perhaps there is another course .
a bold one , that the romans will never see coming .
praetor .
they have given reply .
spartacus makes expected choice .
tell the men to eat well and gather sleep .
dawn &apos;s first light we take vesuvius
and the lives of all those who stand in defiance of rome .
soon we shall leave this place .
never to return .
what your friendship brings me ...
there are no words to express gratitude .
you have returned the favor many times over .
the debt i owe far exceeds modest repayment .
you drew me from the depth of madness .
you gave me strength and purpose
to live beyond the tragedy which betided this house .
such things are of the past .
let them give you no further pain .
i have tried to put it from me .
the memory of all i have lost ,
it fills the very air ,
choking each breath with the sting of loss .
and binding my heart in chains .
you stand upon precipice of release .
because of you .
you &apos;re my savior , ilithyia .
and you mine .
you have given me hope of a life
i thought denied me when my husband fell .
know that such a gift shall be eternally treasured .
the child .
it comes too soon .
this is a sign from the gods !
it must be born within these walls .
come .
let us see their will be done .
we have used every vine we could gather .
enough for four men .
agron . crixus . gannicus .
i would have you by my side .
crixus ...
we will be reunited soon .
in this life , or the next .
i know fear wells within your breast .
and it does so with great cause .
the romans hold numbers far outweighing our own .
yet they have revealed time and again fatal flaw .
that they believe the roman way is the only one .
just as they believe that there is only one way
to leave this mountain .
we shall teach them
that we forge our own paths .
and nothing in this world is impossible ,
when heart and mind are put towards it .
brace rope ,
let us begin a lesson forever remembered .
the sound will mask descent .
the gods bless us with good fortune .
free men create their own .
we are all gods this night .
and the romans shall feel our wrath .
fuck !
prepare yourselves .
when signal comes ...
death shall quickly follow .
we must move quickly .
before deed is discovered .
the hour is late .
sleep will not come .
all i see when eyes close
is the end of spartacus .
and with him reason for being so long absent from rome ,
and more important matters .
you will be victorious , where varinius failed .
a great advantage within the senate .
to be used towards elevation .
one day i shall rise above all others .
the light of accomplishment giving warmth
to loving wife and cherished heir ...
raise alarm !
praetor !
gather the men to formation !
awake the men !
fire !
the signal !
where the fuck is the medicus ? !
he had gone to town ,
the child not expected for weeks .
i have sent the guards to fetch him .
something is wrong .
it claws at me ,
not wanting to leave womb to be born in this place .
i will find something to ease the pain .
do not leave me .
know that i will return .
and together we will see this blessing into the world .
again !
i need help over here !
relocate ammunition .
advance on rear position !
kill anyone in who stands in your path !
halt !
a glorious death .
kill them !
i thought i heard a cry --
what have you done ?
what was always intended ,
to see curse upon this house lifted .
no one left to come between us .
fall back !
fall back !
fall back !
press advantage ! and see victory ours !
stop .
please .
we are friends , are we not ?
the very best .
then why would you do this ?
why would you take my life and that of my child ?
your child ?
you are but a vessel .
carrying a gift from the gods to the house of batiatus .
now then .
let us see it unwrapped ...
i owe you pain .
oenomaus !
oenomaus ...
i go to my wife &apos;s arms .
we shall greet you in the afterlife , my brother .
secure the perimeter !
signal all men to defend this position .
mark your stations !
romans ready !
lucretiaaaaaaa !
hush now little one .
you are safe now .
you are loved ,
and shall be forever .
please .
quintus always wanted a son .
because of you ,
we shall have one .
no .
i will not die
at the hands of a fucking slave !
i am a free man .
the roman finally learns his place before us !
on his knees !
you &apos;ve won nothing .
rome will send legions in my wake .
and one day soon you shall fall to deserved end .
perhaps .
yet it is not this day .
let rome send their legions !
we will face them !
and see all follow glaber in death !
yeah !
now we will become an army .
yeah !
spartacus ! spartacus ! spartacus ! spartacus !
