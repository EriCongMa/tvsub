I don't think I've ever seen you this nervous before.
He's your brother.
Welcome home.
Come here.
And the entire time michael was in prison,
he never let me visit.
I just never thought I'd see the day
I'm having breakfast with his cop girlfriend.
I'm sorry to just drop in on you like this.
I'm glad you did.
She says she's gonna text when she lands.
All right, this is her.
要在摩洛哥待久一点
Change of plans -- she's not coming.
Kono!
Adam!
The guys who work for your brother are gonna want payback.
You need to leave.
I'm going with you.
You can't be serious.
Steve, don't stop her.
Follow your heart.
I'll take good care of her.
I know you will.
I don't know what I was thinking.
Hey, that's funny.
You're the second McGarrett we've had here in 48 hours.
What do you mean "Second McGarrett"?
Doris McGarrett.
You two related?
You went to see Wo Fat.
Now, why don't you tell me right now
why you would do something like that?
Why don't you tell me right now who he is to you?
You want to know why your mother paid me a visit.
I can answer that.
But first, you're going to do something for me.
And what's that?
You're going to get me out of here.
Is that so?
You set me up?
Yes, but not in the way you think.
They're not here to break me out.
They're here to kill me.
And you're the only one who can protect me from them.
From who?
Who are "They"?
Steve?
Steve, you okay?
Get Wo Fat to a secure location,
then meet me at the Palace.
This one's still breathing.
I'm taking him in for questioning.
中国福州东部960海里
I spoke to Chin.
Told him we'll be in Zhejiang Province by the end of the week.
How'd he sound?
Like a man who misses his best friend.
I'd say we can turn around if you're having second thoughts,
but... somehow I don't think that's an option.
I'm happy right here.
Your whole life's in Hawaii.
And I don't know if we can ever go back.
Then we start a new one.
You and me.
Us.
This is not what I wanted for you.
Adam.
What happened with Michael...
you could have never seen it coming.
No matter how much distance we put between us, what happened...
the memory's always going to be there.
I killed my brother.
I love you, cuz.
Aloha.
Malama Pono.
Time to go.
Okay.
What's your name?
We already got your prints.
You might as well tell us.
Who are you? Who sent you?
You've got a bullet in your shoulder.
All right, you help me, I'll get you to a doctor.
Thanks.
So, uh...
I just handed Wo Fat off to the feds.
They're prepping him, getting him ready
for his transfer to a supermax in Colorado.
Did he say who was behind the attack?
No, oddly enough, he wasn't, uh, feeling very chatty.
However, he did want me to commend you on your combat prowess.
He said that?
No, it was more of a look.
So, what were you doing there in the first place?
Before she left, my mother went to see him.
I want to know why.
I'm just taking a wild guess that he didn't tell you anything.
And Doris is conveniently unavailable to give you an answer.
I have my theories.
I just hope they're not right.
Chin, what do you got?
Steve, we got a hit.
The man you're interrogating is Ricardo Cosi.
He's known to be involved in drug trafficking,
kidnapping for ransom, and murder.
He's linked to over 30
National Liberation Movement actions over the past decade.
This guy's NLM?
I thought we were done with these guys.
Apparently not.
Ricardo Cosi is terrorist royalty.
He is the nephew of an NLM leader Stefan Luna.
Aka "El Condor."
So, that's why the NLM went after Wo Fat.
Because he helped us get Salgado.
And prevent the attack in San Francisco.
Now they're looking for payback.
This guy's got a blood tie to the NLM leader,
it means he's gonna have some
serious intelligence value.
Empty your pockets and step on through.
One at a time, please.
Mahalo. Next.
Excuse me, sir. Over here.
I'm going to need you to empty your pockets.
Everybody down!
Everybody...
on the floor!
Face down!
Face down!
Don't make me ask twice.
Let's go-- face down, face down!
Get down.
Hey, you...
face down!
Get down!
You two, come on, move, move, move!
Don't do anything stupid!
Come in, get on the floor.
Shoulder to shoulder, don't be shy.
Take out your cell phones.
Cell phones!
Hold them in the air.
Heads down.
Chin, hey, what's up?
Steve, we got a situation here.
What kind of situation?
Steve?
Chin?
No service.
Vamos, vamos, vamos, vamos, vamos.
Gunshots were reported. Get that barricade up now.
Lock the place off. Make sure everything's locked down.
Captain Grover,
hell of a week to start a new job.
Wouldn't have it any other way.
Welcome to Hawaii.
What are our entry points?
We got eight entrances and exits,
all on the ground floor, and a fire escape in the back.
Sergeant Lukela, I'm so sorry.
Is anyone hurt?
Gunshots were reported,
so there could be casualties among the hostages.
What about Five-O?
Far as we know, they're still inside.
You can't reach them?
Got no communications.
The phone lines have been cut
and they're jamming cell phone signals.
Well, whoever they are, they know what they're doing.
We also confirmed that all the entrances
have been wired with explosives,
so there's no easy way in or out.
Like I said,
not your typical hostage-takers.
If these guys have locked themselves in,
they won't get tired, hungry or give up.
They came to play.
Hefei.
We are controlling every exit.
He's got to be with Five-O.
Find them.
This goes down the same day we bring this guy in.
It can't be a coincidence.
It's got to be a rescue op, right?
El Condor wants his nephew back?
Oh, I'm very touched.
This guy's leaking. He's not gonna make it.
Sir?
Lieutenant, there's a situation at the Palace.
I think you're gonna want to go down there.
They got every cop on the island out there.
Good.
You told me you cleared all the offices.
We did.
It seems you weren't as careful as you thought.
I'm trapped on the second floor in the offices of Five-O.
They cut all the phone lines.
They're jamming our cell signals.
I think there's more hiding in the basement.
Please, they'll kill everyone unless you do something.
You got to help.
We got men here with guns, wounded hostages.
Please, you got to help us.
I'm trapped on the second floor in the offices of Five-O.
They cut all the phone lines.
They're jamming our cell signals. I think there...
Excuse me, brah. Excuse me. Excuse me.
Whoa, whoa, that's as far as you go.
You got to let me through.
I got ohana in there.
And we're doing everything we can to get them out.
But right now, I need you to wait here.
I'm sorry.
Don't be sorry. Let me through, brah.
Sir, I'm not gonna ask you again.
Back off.
You even a cop, brah?
I'm in the academy, brah.
So move along before I arrest you.
You mean before you call somebody over to arrest me.
In three months, you better look out.
90 days.
I'll be waiting.
What are you gonna do? You gonna shoot me?
I considered it.
Oh, you did? Well, do me a favor, then. Put me out of my misery.
Did you check the emergency exit?
No, I went to get donuts.
Yeah, I checked the emergency exit. It's not an option.
They got something rigged to the door.
It is not... cop friendly.
Steve?
Yeah, thank you. I see.
Come on. Come on.
Buddy, we lose this guy, we got no leverage.
You're not helping, all right?
Okay. All right.
Okay. Come on. Come on.
Don't move. I'll be right back.
What'd you say?
Now's not really the time. Um...
Gabby, she's, uh... she's in town.
All right? And, um, for a minute there, I thought I was...
I was actually happy. Which is a weird thing for me
because I don't really know what that means, but...
you know, I had forgotten about Kono leaving.
I forgot about Salgado and his son.
I forgot about getting shot at.
Again. And then the phone rang.
I had to tell Gabby I'm going somewhere,
so I turn to her, and I sit her down and I say,
"Don't move. I'll be right back."
Instead of what?
I don't know. I figure I could've said
something better than that.
Okay, let's hear it for the Boy Scouts of America.
Nice work, buddy.
What were you gonna... what were you gonna tell her?
You love her or something?
I don't know. I mean, maybe.
Okay. Well, you know what?
Maybe you should be sure-- how about that?--
before you say something like that to a woman, okay?
Because once you say it, you can't unsay it,
you understand me? It's a serious thing.
I understand.
Are you speaking from experience?
Because I personally don't think it counts
when you say it to a pistol.
We got to move.
Get up. You, get up. Up, up, up.
The drama continues to unfold at Iolani Palace
with dozens of law enforcement officers on the scene
of an apparent shooting and hostage situation.
There has been no official confirmation,
but sources tell us, earlier today,
gunfire erupted inside the Palace
as several armed intruders forced their way in.
Ah, great.
Looks like you could use some help.
This has gone on long enough.
Sergeant.
Grover, what are you doing?
My job.
Seriously, what are you doing?
Where in the hell are you going?
Hold up! Hold up!
What's he doing?
We're going in.
What's up?
What do you want?
You fellas hungry
or anything in there? We're, uh...
thinking about ordering Chinese.
Leave. Now.
No problem. Listen, if you...
change your mind, though, let me know.
All right, gentlemen, we have three hostiles on the floor.
Steyr Tactical Machine Pistols and extra mags.
Approximately 27 hostages on the horizontal.
Let's get hot, guys. We're going in.
Ricardo.
Okay, fine. You were right.
It worked.
We got about 60 seconds
before they send somebody else down here.
Come help me with this guy, will you?
Five-O.
Five-O?
Listen to me.
You're holding our brother
Ricardo Cosi.
I'll give you one minute
to return him to me
or I start shooting hostages.
Please.
Just so you know...
I mean what I say...
You.
Up.
Up!
20 seconds.
Ten seconds.
Five seconds.
No. No.
On your knees.
I know...
...there's more than two of you.
That's a really bad idea.
Are you offering to go first?
Chin.
It's all over. Get down here.
Tomas?
Ricardo.
Est Bien
Gracias.
You're free to arrest us now.
Okay, gentlemen. Weapons hot.
We're in position, Captain.
We got movement.
Steady.
Take them to federal lockup, separate cells.
Duke, call the FBI, DHS.
Have them stand by for debrief.
Commander, how did you get them to surrender?
I didn't.
Then how is this over?
I don't think it is.
There's more wounded inside.
It's a through-and-through.
Let's get two large bore lines in her, stat.
I need her heart rate and blood pressure.
Gentlemen,
so good to see you.
Oh, we had you worried, Max?
Not for a moment.
Oh, you're a very good liar.
We appreciate it, though.
That's one scenario I hadn't figured on--
executing Cosi like that.
That guy's El Condor's nephew.
Why go through all this trouble if
you're just gonna kill him once you get him back?
Cosi's blood tie to El Condor makes him a liability.
He probably knew everything there was to know about this operation.
They needed to make sure he wasn't gonna talk.
All right, maybe I buy that,
but then why surrender and risk becoming liabilities yourselves?
Where are they gonna go?
Place is completely surrounded, they got nowhere to escape to.
And let's keep in mind, these guys,
they are well-trained fanatics--
they have no problem risking their lives for their, uh... mission.
I think this mission was more than just about Cosi.
Why? What do you mean?
When I was holed up in HQ, there were two NLM soldiers
who came and grabbed data off our drives
before they destroyed the hardware.
What the hell were they looking for?
All right, look, we got to move.
Chin, listen, Danny and I are gonna interview these suspects.
While we do, see what you can do about reconstructing the drives.
If we can find out what they were looking for,
maybe we can work out what their next move is.
You got it.
Catherine, we're fine.
Oh, I am so glad to hear that.
Who is this?
I think you already know.
Where's Lieutenant Rollins?
She will be all right, Commander,
as long as you do exactly what I say.
Take a deep breath and listen very carefully to me.
What I ask of you is very simple.
I get my people back,
or your girlfriend will never be seen again.
Don't do it, Steve.
Don't you dare do it!
Catherine! Catherine!
Don't do it, don't give them any --
What happens to her now is up to you.
You listen to me. This only ends one way,
and that's with you dead, you understand that?
I will call you back in ten minutes.
If my people are not free by that time.
Well... do I have to state the obvious?
We got to move.
What the hell's going on?
No time to explain; I'll explain on the way.
On the way where?
SWAT Commander. Go.
We're heading eastbound on King Street.
All right, SWAT van just made a left on King Street.
We're gonna lose 'em. Come on, let's go.
Hold on, hold on.
Could we have a little talk now, please?
A talk about what?
Uh, I don't know, the weather? I want to talk about what we're doing.
This isn't the best time, Danny.
See, that's where I disagree. I think now is the perfect time,
because I would like to be prepared.
I need to know what's going on.
I need to know if I need to put on some extra Kevlar,
need to know if I need to call my daughter
and say good-bye for the last time.
We're gonna do what they asked.
We're gonna release the prisoners.
That's what we're gonna do, all right? We talked.
Please understand that I want to get
Catherine back just as bad as you do,
but how do we know they're gonna let her go
if we do what they ask?
We can't.
That's my point! It's stupid!
We can't do this.
It's not even stupid-- it's beyond stupid.
It's off the goof meter completely.
It's career-ending, certifiably...
Okay, okay, will you stop? Listen to me.
I lost my dad dealing with people like this;
I'm not gonna lose Catherine, too.
I-I have your back.
Always, okay?
Thank you.
There it is.
Hold on.
Grover!
Out, out.
What's going on, McGarrett?
Hands in the air. On your knees.
Get on your knees!
Don't move, don't move.
Everybody out of the van!
Out of the van right now!
Out of the van!
Show me your weapons. Put 'em on the ground.
Weapons in front of you on the ground right now.
Weapons in front of you on the ground.
Sidearms, too. Let's go, let's go!
You, over here!
On your stomachs. Hands behind your backs.
McGarrett, what the hell are you doing, man?
No time. I can't explain.
All right, get out.
Out, out.
Out.
Go. Get out.
So nice to see you again.
If anything happens to Lieutenant Rollins,
you're the one I kill first.
Can I ask you something?
What?
Are the keys in the Camaro?
You know, you just lost your badge, McGarrett.
You're all done.
You might be right about that.
All right, it's done.
You're a smart man, Commander.
Where is she?
History doesn't have to repeat itself.
I had a feeling you'd listen to reason.
I just did what you asked.
Now, you tell me where she is.
Let's go.
Catherine.
Catherine?
Catherine?
Catherine!
Hey, Catherine!
Catherine! This is it.
He said she'd be right here. We'll find her. Come on.
Catherine?
Catherine, where are you? Catherine.
Catherine!
Steve.
Catherine!
Catherine!
Steve.
Catherine.
You okay?
Yeah.
You all right?
I'm good. I'm good.
All right, I'm gonna go, uh...
I'll go wait by the van.
If anybody needs me, I'll be over by the, uh...
Ow, wow, look at that-- that's a Giant Amakihi.
I thought these were extinct, no?
You okay?
Yeah.
You all right?
You shouldn't have let them go.
Come on, I'm not gonna lose you.
You sure you're okay?
Yeah,
yeah, I'm good, but you let them get away.
That's what they think.
Vámonos. Let's go, let's go!
I always figured your driving is
what would kill my car.
Chin, you okay?
Yeah. They must have been expecting a tail.
This is terrible.
All right, did you see the other car the guys were driving?
Late model SUV, black, no plates.
Call Lukela, have him put out an alert.
Oh, you don't got to do that. You just... tell him yourself.
All right, geez.
On your knees! Guns on the ground!
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Hey!
Down! Down!
Hands where we can see them!
I had no choice. They had Catherine.
And in exchange, you released four terrorists.
Yeah, well, I had a plan.
Oh, you had a plan.
Well, where the hell are they?
Because all I see around here is an epic fail the size of Texas.
Easy, Captain, before this gets out of hand.
Look around you.
This has already gotten way past out of hand.
McGarrett and his merry band
of do-whatever the-hell-you-want
should have considered the repercussions
before jumping me and my men.
Look the only thing that got hurt was your pride.
Immunity and means, my ass.
I want you and all your people
to put their weapons on the ground right now.
Not gonna happen, all right? This isn't the mainland.
It's Hawaii.
We do things a little differently around here.
So, the more time we waste,
the more time the NLM has to escape.
So, what do you want to do?
Those guys escape, that is on you.
Um, you're invading his personal space,
which is a bad idea.
You know, see this right here?
We can do this later.
Count on it.
Yeah, good. I'll be there.
Sure thing.
Duke, we're gonna need air support and roadblocks now.
Let's also call the Coast Guard, all right?
Anything up in the air
or in the water could be our guys.
Duke, what's the matter?
News chopper was reported stolen this morning.
Didn't even register
with everything that's going on until now.
It's got to be connected.
H1 onramp's two blocks from here, right?
Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's where they were headed.
If the NLM is planning
on using this stolen chopper as a getaway,
there's only one place I can think of
around here where they could land and take off again
without drawing too much attention to themselves.
All units be advised.
Suspect vehicle is a black SUV,
possibly heading towards Aloha Stadium.
Suspects should be considered armed and dangerous.
Hold on.
Both hands up!
Hands where we can see them!
Cease fire!
Cease fire!
They're all dead.
We're missing one.
Where's Steve?
Vámonos! Vámonos!
Vámonos! Vámonos!
You okay?
Yeah.
Come on.
Come on, Superman. Okay, you see,
this is the reason I don't like to fly, because of you.
No, you don't like to fly 'cause you have a fear of fun.
This is fun to you? This is you having fun?
Did you break anything?
Will you shut up already?
Someday I'm gonna miss this.
All right, boys, listen.
We've had a long day.
Why don't we, uh, let HPD do the paperwork,
and let's go grab a beer on me?
Yeah.
What about Captain Grover?
We did our job.
He's got to get over it.
If he doesn't?
Then we got a problem.
What else is new?
Hold on. Stop for a second.
Did you say free beer?
I did.
What are we doing sitting here?
Would you give me a hand up?
Oh, you want a hand now? Here, there's your hand.
Give me your hand. Come on.
Come here.
You want to tell me
how you caught up with that helicopter?
I was chasing El Condor across the field
while his guy fired at me.
And then, just as they were getting away,
they were taking off, I jumped up and I grabbed
one of the helicopter struts with my arm.
You know what? Forget about it.
Commander, you're going to have to make this fast.
We're wheels-up in five minutes.
I only need two.
Coach is even worse than I imagined.
Why don't you cut the crap?
I just saved your life.
Now, tell me, why did my mother come and visit you in prison?
She came to apologize.
Apologize for what?
For killing my father.
You killed her husband-- my father--
and then you hunted her for 20 years.
Why would my mother ever apologize to you?
That is a question only she can answer.
I was afraid you were going to say that.
What are you doing, Steve?
What do you think you're going to find?
The truth?
You don't want to know the truth!
Run this right away.
Against what?
My blood.
I want to know if Wo Fat's my brother.
Whoa. This is some heavy stuff.
Should I sign a confidentiality agreement or something?
No, it's fine. You tell anybody
what you saw, I'm gonna shoot you.
Yeah. Okay, that's funny.
I don't think he was kidding.
Toast, focus.
Oh, here we go.
These are the last commands
that came in just before the NLM
bad boys destroyed your baby.
Looks like a search request for satellite data.
Data which was then transmitted
to an unknown third... party.
What is it?
What were they looking for?
Hello?
Kono, it's Chin.
Listen to me very carefully. There's been a security breach.
Your location has been compromised.
By who?
The NLM.
We believe they sold your location to the Yakuza.
You and Adam need to get out of there right now.
Chin?
Just do it, Kono! Go!
Who was that?
We need to leave now.
What?
Don't pack.
Don't take anything. Let's just go.
