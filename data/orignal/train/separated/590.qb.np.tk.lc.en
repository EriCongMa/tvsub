pierce , you made us all drive to
a warehouse in the middle of nowhere .
you could at least tell us why .
hey , i know as much as you .
i got a letter from
the executor of my father &apos;s estate .
it said to come out here with my seven closest friends .
you brought six .
well , who else was he gonna bring ?
levar burton was a maybe .
mr. hawthorne .
i apologize .
gilbert .
even from the grave , my father &apos;s got you
by the short and curly salt and pepperies .
my name is gilbert lawson .
i was cornelius hawthorne &apos;s assistant for over 30 years ,
and before that , i was just the teenager
who read the bible to him in the bath .
all right , all right .
it &apos;s inheritance time .
how &apos; bout that check , soul brother ?
your father did leave you something ,
but it &apos;s more of an activity .
thank you for keeping it as creepy as possible .
this looks like a multi @-@ player gaming interface .
i &apos;ve heard enough .
oh , that diabolical old fossil face .
i asked him for money to invest in video games back in 1979 .
cornelius spent over 30 years
developing a video game for you .
it was his dying wish
that you and seven of your closest friends would play it .
lavar burton was a maybe .
so , please , choose a seat .
cool .
so a 100 @-@ year @-@ old man designed
a 30 @-@ year @-@ old video game ?
this i &apos;ve got to see .
once you &apos;re seated behind your computers ,
a photograph of you will be taken
and an avatar will be made from your likeness .
i didn &apos;t bring my likeness .
don &apos;t smile .
all right , everyone , let &apos;s begin .

第三季第二十集
nice !
cool .
old school .
cool , cool , cool .
which one is me ?
i assume nothing because i &apos;m not racist .
we &apos;re adorable !
why did this thing take photos
if it was going to completely fabricate random body shapes ?
that &apos;s what i &apos;m saying ! my hair looks good , though .
orange button is jump .
which guy am i ?
there &apos;s a door here .
peace . love .
what &apos;s that ?
i think it &apos;s a hippie .
peace . love .
annie , stop &quot; awing &quot; everything .
don &apos;t be jaded . he &apos;s saying &quot; peace . &quot;
hello .
sex .
did he say &quot; sex &quot; ?
drugs . sex .
oh , my god .
hold on , i &apos;m coming .
darn ! shoot !
dang it . um-
jeff , you just murdered annie .
well , better than doing nothing !
i &apos;m not sure that &apos;s the case .
that &apos;s debatable .
you guys , help me .
the way you helped annie ?
sex .
before we engage , we should hang back and study their tactics .
what ?
group sex .
oh , my god !
oh , cool , i &apos;m alive .
pierce ?
this game makes no sense .
what happened to you ?
i don &apos;t want to talk about it .
pierce , point the joystick right .
so i &apos;m supposed to just guess that ?
where are the instructions ?
take that ! take that ! yeah , we rule !
oh , you guys are alive .
you re @-@ spawn in the study room when you die .
here , i &apos;ll show you .
jeffrey ! shame on you !
&quot; hang back and study their tactics &quot; ?
let him get it out of his system .
ah , forget it . let &apos;s just keep moving .
now what ?
welcome to hawkthorne .
that &apos;s dad &apos;s voice . dad ?
piercinald , in 1980,
you said that video games , not moist towelettes ,
were the business of the future .
today , moist towelettes are stocked in every supermarket ,
while arcade after arcade closes .
he &apos;s got a point .
nevertheless , i designed this game to be played upon my death
by you and whatever cabal of fruits ,
junkies , and sluts you call your friends .
her name is britta .
only one player can win-
the first to reach my throne inside castle hawkthorne .
their reward , pierce , will be your inheritance .
what ?
his inheritance ? what ?
so you see , pierce , turns out you were right .
video games are important .
worst son ever !
well , great . how do i fight you guys ?
which button fights ?
pierce , stop .
pierce , relax .
pierce , stay in the game , stay in the game .
pierce , calm down .
nobody &apos;s gonna fight you .
why not ?
because when you &apos;re friends with someone for three years ,
it &apos;s weird to steal their family &apos;s money .
and there wouldn &apos;t be a lot of sport in beating you .
look at yourself .
yeah , he &apos;s right .
you &apos;re playing the game wrong .
why is harry belafonte in here ?
it &apos;s gilbert .
you &apos;re not supposed to cooperate ,
you &apos;re supposed to compete .
thanks for the advice ,
but i think we can choose how we want to play .
i suppose we can .
is he being ominous ?
why are you being ominous ?
whoa . we can pick stuff up ?
this game is more complex than you can imagine .
and aside from its programmers ,
who have all been deported back to china ,
i &apos;m the one who knows how it works .
run , run ! he &apos;s gonna throw a knife !
he &apos;s gonna throw a knife ! go !
jump ! jump !
wait ! what are you- ?
he &apos;s a psychopath ! he &apos;s suffo-
hey , look , buddy , i know it must have sucked
being colonel sanders &apos; manservant and all ,
but pierce is technically our friend ,
and we &apos;re not gonna watch you screw him over .
perhaps you should be asking yourselves
how you intend to stop me .
how about if we come over there and kick your ass ?
go get him , troy .
be my guest .
but 30 seconds after you leave your chairs ,
the weight sensors will recognize it as an automatic forfeit .
weight sensors ?
that &apos;s it . let &apos;s get that jag !
yeah !
get him !
kick that hippie &apos;s ass !
let &apos;s go ! move , move , move !
i think he left a note .
what ?
&quot; after you &apos;ve squandered the last of your savings ,
i &apos;ll watch you writhe , penniless , in the gutter ,
through a telescope in the penthouse office of hawthorne tower . &quot;
you can leave notes . this game is incredible .
pierce ?
no , pierce !
please , no !
we need you !
just let me die .
pierce , so gilbert knows a couple tricks .
big deal . we outnumber him .
and most importantly , while he &apos;s fighting for greed ,
we &apos;re fighting for friendship ,
which means we can &apos;t lose , okay ?
okay .
okay !
i guess there &apos;s no hug button .
everybody keep pierce protected .
we have to get him to the throne
of hawkthorne before gilbert .
and don &apos;t forget , when you die ,
you go all the way back to the study room .
so ... don &apos;t die .
good pep talk , jeff .
yeah , i used to love dying ,
but that speech really turned me around .
whatever .
what &apos;s that ? kill it !
it &apos;s a girl milking a cow , pierce .
i &apos;ll check it out . i owe jeff that .
i wasn &apos;t gonna say it .
i am hilda . i live in the village .
lesbian .
选择 : 小姐 我有问题
i can help with that .
i have information on many topics .
cool .
the throne is in castle hawkthorne , north of here .
you unlock the castle with the white crystal of discipline ,
which you must free from the black caverns .
i &apos;m picking up on some hidden symbolism .
right , &quot; white crystal . &quot;
you think dad was into meth ?
you can usually get supplies in a town like this .
man , why can &apos;t my mom be here ?
she always said my video game knowledge would come in handy .
i never believed her .
everybody split up and take a hut .
our only chance of beating gilbert is to cover more ground .
i have information on the following topics .
holy crap .
where have you been my whole life ?
i buy and sell weapons and armor .
武器 盔甲 药剂
cool . we need weapons .
ooh . well , what &apos;s free ?
can we have a torch ?
thief ! thief !
annie , put it back .
sorry . sorry .
sorry , sorry , sorry .
oh , my god .
what are you doing ?
it was an accident !
he &apos;s dying !
all right , hold on , hold on !
now what are you doing ?
he was suffering !
yeah , from axe wounds !
well , if this isn &apos;t worth any points , what is ?
you &apos;re asking me ? i &apos;m still looking for a pong paddle .
let &apos;s play poker .
oh , now we &apos;re talking .
check the desk . i &apos;ll check the dresser .
how do i straighten that painting ?
you can &apos;t . stop playing like a girl .
stop playing like a girl ?
here &apos;s the thing about women , jeff .
we don &apos;t hack and slash our way through life
because we &apos;re one with life .
help me hide the body .
oh , my lord . oh , my lord .
shirley , these things happen in video games .
they do ?
yes .
we can &apos;t get hung up on real world morality .
we need to survive and win .
hello , i &apos;m the blacksmith &apos;s wife-
aah ! help !
oh , crap !
guard the door .
what ?
shirley !
no witnesses !
grab everything you can carry .
i &apos;ll check upstairs for any more family .
don &apos;t give me that look . these are your loose ends .
i &apos;m just tying &apos; em up .
this is so cool .
where are your clothes ?
pierce taught me poker .
i &apos;m not good at it .
you still talking to this girl ?
yeah , she only has three moves
that you activate with basic patterns of stimulus .
i &apos;ve never felt this way before .
abed , don &apos;t get weird .
oh , i won &apos;t .
she &apos;s not ready for anything serious ,
but she wants me to meet her family .
my father is the blacksmith .
her father &apos;s a blacksmith .
hello !
everybody go shopping ?
that &apos;s all we did .
is that hut on fire ?
oh , my . what an unexplained tragedy .
don &apos;t we look comfy at a cauldron .
check it out .
ooh , see , i &apos;ll put all of this in here ,
and then that , and then i &apos;ll hit this .
what is it ?
i assume , like , a strength potion .
then i assume it &apos;s poison .
you &apos;re just jealous because we found a world
where i know what i &apos;m doing .
this place is 20 cat turds and a pixies poster
from being your apartment .
what &apos;s with the st . pauli girl ?
hilda &apos;s parents lived there .
now she has no family .
she &apos;ll be forced to marry a male villager
or take her chances in the wilderness .
what kind of game is this ?
oh , crap , it &apos;s gilbert .
well , well , well .
looks like someone &apos;s one step behind .
yeah , if you &apos;re looking for equipment , tough luck .
the store was lost in a freak accident .
i hardly need equipment , young lady .
while you were shopping , i gained enough levels to do this .
he &apos;s shooting lightning and i &apos;m naked !
get behind us ! we have armor !
oh , great ! gilbert !
oh , great ! evil jedi lightning gilbert !
britta , drink that super strength potion you made .
oh , right , right , right , right .
hurry up , britta !
i &apos;m trying , i &apos;m trying ! aah !
damn it , i thought we could count on britta
to not screw up drinking .
this &apos;ll be fun .
what the hell ?
here &apos;s hoping we can count on her
to screw up making potions .
unbelievable .
jeff bet all our lives on britta and won ,
and i lost my pants to a pair of nines .
very well .
let &apos;s play .
abed , are you sure about these ?
yeah . it just feels like the right thing to do .
hey , i made it back .
you guys never died . how did you beat gilbert ?
oh , you know . teamwork .
we were headed for the black caves
to find the white crystal .
we were just saying good @-@ bye to abed .
i &apos;m gonna stay here in the village with hilda
and help her rebuild her life .
abed , she &apos;s a program .
people have said similar things about me .
uh @-@ oh . he &apos;s playing the rain man card .
let &apos;s bounce .
i &apos;ve got an inheritance to win .
offensive . called it .
shut up , britta .
you did great in there , jeff .
shut up , pierce .
okay , duck . stay ducked .
okay , unduck .
okay , now jump .
i think we &apos;re almost there .
thank god . this cave is the worst .
i know , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s more offensive-
the actual racism or the insulting notion
that it might somehow rub off on us .
look out ! jive turkeys !
kill them before they start multiplying !
yeah , suck on this !
take that , jive turkey !
all right ! the white crystal !
get it !
i &apos;ll take it .
i &apos;ve earned it by having friends .
this is it .
it certainly is .
no , man !
you again ?
now i &apos;ll have that crystal .
i think you &apos;ll have this .
whoops .
arrows !
what ? come on !
where &apos;d you get all that stuff ?
you &apos;ve only been alive for an hour .
well , that was not fair .
what the hell , gilbert ?
you &apos;re cheating , which i have no problem with ,
but you &apos;re getting caught , and that &apos;s not cool !
yeah , don &apos;t be a knob .
that inheritance is rightfully mine !
rightfully ?
i &apos;m his son .
so am i.
what ? that can &apos;t be true .
you &apos;re half ... white .
nice save .
do you remember your childhood nanny , etta ?
well , etta had a hot cousin .
my mother .
so you see , pierce ,
i am your half @-@ brother ,
and i am more your father &apos;s son than you ever were ,
so shut up and play the game .
let &apos;s go , pierce .
okay , look , i know things seem hopeless
because he &apos;s all the way to the castle with the crystal
and we &apos;re starting over ,
but here &apos;s the thing-
we &apos;re better at this game now .
we &apos;ve died and been reborn , and that makes us heroes .
let &apos;s get him !
i guess the fact that we &apos;re still playing
means he hasn &apos;t won yet .
yeah , but what &apos;s the point ?
he &apos;ll just keep cheating until he wins .
why are all the trees cut down ?
isn &apos;t this where abed &apos;s village was ?
hello , old friends .
abed !
you remember hilda .
i live in the village . i love abed .
did she just say your name ?
yeah , if you max out a character &apos;s trust
and affection levels , you can gain access
to a front @-@ end scripting language .
watch .
cool cool cool !
she can make babies for me .
oh , and i can &apos;t ?
i can &apos;t .
come on inside .
i built this from scratch .
check out my castle .
oh , it &apos;s nice .
i hope this isn &apos;t blood gold .
this is my family .
baby abed has my eyes and her bonnet .
each baby is capable of executing custom code ,
which means you can write a code
that makes one baby tell another baby what to do ,
much like real children on a playground .
oh , abed , but-
annie , let &apos;s find the tin man &apos;s heart later .
abed , how much stuff do you have here
and what can we make with it ?
that depends .
on ?
on what you can imagine .
welcome .
you are the first to make it to the throne of hawkthorne .
let me take a look at you .
according to your complexion ,
i think you might be gilbert lawson .
is this true ?
just a moment .
hello , gilbert .
due to the nature of our relationship ,
i &apos;ll need your electronic signature
on this legally @-@ binding agreement .
it dictates that you will never , ever besmirch the hawthorne name
with any outlandish notions regarding you genealogical origins .
you are the bastard offspring of a colored seductress
and an unknown , weak @-@ willed miscegenist ...
and any assertion on your part to the contrary
will be grounds for the seizure of this inheritance .
do you agreed ?
it &apos;s a simple question , gilbert .
do you agree ?
thank you for being honest , gilbert .
good bye .
no !
i &apos;m your son !
i &apos;m sorry , gilbert .
i always knew you &apos;d disappoint me .
cool cool cool ! cool cool cool !
ah , i see you &apos;ve chosen teamwork .
a coward &apos;s strategy .
i will upgrade your challenge accordingly .
i bequeath my fortune to no inferiors .
yeah !
attack !
what &apos;s this now ?
here we go !
get him ! aim for the joints !
get him !
die , racism !
troy and abed shooting lava .
take that !
hey ! look at me now , dad !
i suppose you &apos;re wondering , player ,
why record myself breathing weird
and letting you destroy me .
because i am a man of honor .
so you &apos;ve earned the pleasure of my death .
but i didn &apos;t .
i &apos;m not the one that beat you .
yes , you are .
we &apos;re forfeiting .
warning , player forfeit in 30 ...
gilbert , you &apos;re right .
you were more his son than me .
you took all his crap
and you didn &apos;t even get to take his name .
he once sat on me in church just so he could see better .
we &apos;ve only been playing this game a couple of hours .
you &apos;ve been playing it your whole life ,
and now it &apos;s time for your reward , brother .
so get in there and kill our dad .
thank you , pierce .
wait a second . here , take this .
you may need it .
oh , pierce .
you really don &apos;t know how this works , do you ?
are you always carrying that ?
not in the shower .
i &apos;d like to thank you again for today
and offer my apologies for my conduct .
i wasn &apos;t myself .
family can make a person do a lot of crazy things .
i understand . i have an uncle who makes his own pizza .
don &apos;t worry about it .
if it would make it up to any of you in any way ,
there &apos;s a bar in town called skeepers ,
and i hear they make a specialty drink-
a margarita , in fact , and it &apos;s served in a glass
an entire yard long .
my treat .
score .
this is the greatest day of my life .
i &apos;ve always wanted to have a brother .
hey , hey , settle a bet .
the word &quot; mulatto , &quot; is it okay or just borderline ?
we apologize for him .
oh , that &apos;s okay . he &apos;s family .
hilda , my love ,
i said i &apos;d come back for you .
i don &apos;t know . i just think that in a parallel universe ,
blorgons are-
hold on .
a baby . i wasn &apos;t expecting this .
guess we &apos;ll have to support it .
i guess i could get some kind of job ,
maybe at beans and more .
i &apos;ll probably have to work double shifts , but-
oh , i see .
while you &apos;re off , climbing the ladder at beans and more ,
i &apos;ll just stay home and raise him alone .
that &apos;s fine . i &apos;ll just give up on my dreams .
here we go .
what ?
he needs to learn a strong man can cry .
cool cool cool .
so , what were you saying about blorgons ?
blorgons- in this other universe ,
they &apos;re actually called glorbons .
