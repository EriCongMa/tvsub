stop dumping . stop dumping .
what is matter ?
lower your bed .
you can &apos;t dump here no more . talk to your boss .
always we are dumping here .
put the shit back in your truck .
what ? that is huge job !
where i am supposed to dump this ?
i just now find out it &apos;s asbestos you &apos;ve been dumping over there .
what did you think it was ?
i never asked .
tampax . what the fuck do i know ?
well , now you know .
you and stefano
have been pocketing how much on this cowboys @-@ and @-@ lndians asbestos removal ?
checkout to municipal government
billing the townships like you &apos;re following all the epa regulations .
you got the same scam , so cut through the bullshit .
how much you figure you &apos;re owed ?
25 % .
don &apos;t be an asshole .
there &apos;s close monitoring at every landfill .
if somebody had been upfront ...
nobody &apos;s been hiding nothing .
i &apos;ve had the same dumping deal with the operations manager
since i &apos;ve been at barone sanitation .
you &apos;re not there no more . i am . you &apos;re enjoying your severance package .
25 % . that &apos;s not gonna happen .
you &apos;ve got a backyard , a pool . dump it there .
that &apos;s my only other suggestion .
he &apos;s got us by the cazz &apos; .
unless that guy at the landfill decides to play ball .
he &apos;s shitting his pants he &apos;ll get pinched by the epa .
frankly , tone ,
i &apos;m thinking maybe we should meet phil &apos;s number .
why ? i think that would set a terrible precedent right now .
just bend over
when he just became boss of the family over there ?
yeah , well , that &apos;s the fly in the ointment .
even still , i say let him have it .
life &apos;s too short .
it &apos;s also too short to live it as a fucking lackey .
true too .
is this &quot; make @-@ believe ballroom &quot; ?
how many times you gonna change the stations ?
the departed soundtrack &apos;s killer .
you got it ?
yeah , it &apos;s good .
regarding phil , i gotta ask ,
whatever happened to &quot; stop and smell the roses &quot; ?
you &apos;re right . you &apos;re right .
you can &apos;t fight every fucking battle , right ?
asbestos .
each day &apos;s a gift .
every time i look at my kid , that &apos;s what i realise .
and that shit with junior , please .
just that people like phil ,
they &apos;re not on that page .
take those roses and stick &apos; em up your ass , thorns first .
this system &apos;s got no balls .
so how was your party that day at the house ?
slow the fuck down , will you ?
maybe you should go back , heidi .
i &apos;m on my learner &apos;s permit after dark .
you gotta help me .
i &apos;m coming .
i &apos;ll never pass the drug test .
what ?
you gotta get me out .
i &apos;ll lose my licence .
never pass a drug test .
call me a taxi .
we &apos;ve been in an accident .
old pumping station road ,
past the reservoir .

sweetheart , there &apos;s been an accident .
we were coming back from the city ...
christopher &apos;s dead .
oh , my god !
all right .
carm .
what happened ?
he drove off the road and the car flipped over .
i &apos;ll tell you in detail .
are you ok ?
i banged my knee , the one from high school .
i &apos;m fine , but
he wasn &apos;t wearing a belt .
where are you , st clare &apos;s ?

if they haven &apos;t already .

yeah .
all right . let me get dressed .
thank you .
mr tony , mr sil is here .
ok .
mrs carmela say you should stay in bed .
have him come up .
we &apos;re right here , tone .
we came as soon as we heard .
patsy went to chrissy &apos;s mom &apos;s house .
that &apos;s where carmela is .
carlo &apos;s coming up .
yeah .
how you doing , tone ?
my knee got banged up .
they said it &apos;ll probably be ok .
last thing i remember was
pulling away from phil .
skid marks all over the place , the cops told carm .
he had a heavy foot , that kid , always .
almost put me through a billboard once .
hey , tone .
come on in .
i &apos;m so sorry , tone .
i still can &apos;t believe it .
thanks . i know you two were close .
i was making my collections and
anthony maffei called me . jesus .
it &apos;s carlo , i bet .
fucking idiot didn &apos;t even have his seat belt on .
his chest filled up .
suffocated on his own blood .
oh , jesus . -poor kid .
seems like that &apos;s the cause of death .
it &apos;s not carlo . i heard aj .
carlo &apos;s coming up ?
what &apos;s with you and carlo &apos;s arrival ?
i &apos;m just saying .
they &apos;re gonna do a full blood test on him .
see , you know ,
if alcohol ,
drugs or ...
it did occur to me .
he didn &apos;t seem high , did he ?
are you kidding ?
i would have been furious .
i would have strangled him .
he &apos;d been working the programme
since he threw little paulie out that window .
let &apos;s not go there .
even before that he was battling that shit .
he gave it his all .
well , anyway , he &apos;s gone now , our chrissy .
crazy fucking maniac .
the thing to take to heart ,
t , you &apos;re here .
you &apos;re all right .
you could have been killed .
what are you gonna do ?
thanks .
what are you doing ?
i gotta try and get up .
i gotta go and meet carm over at chrissy &apos;s .
kelli and all that .
i &apos;ll make you a plate .
get me a scotch .
are you serious ?
yeah , and have one yourself .
they were close , the two cousins .
you all right ?
i know i had my differences with that kid ,
but maybe i didn &apos;t do right by him , neither .
if you were his dad , i was his dutch uncle ,
and what the fuck did i do but get pissed off ,
fight with him over cocksucking fucking money ?
i &apos;d break his balls when he tried not to have a drink
or a little taste of snow .
it &apos;s over , paulie .
did anybody ever hear from the hospital ?
i was waiting till kelli woke up .
they found cocaine in his blood .
cause of death was a haemothorax .
airbags can crush the ribs when there &apos;s no other restraint .
they said he might have made it ,
but he didn &apos;t .
couldn &apos;t have worn his seat belt ?
no wonder . he was whack @-@ a @-@ doo .
al , stop it .
baloney . he leaves our granddaughter fatherless .
my only child !
drinking won &apos;t help , honey .
look at this . syracuse is losing .
i don &apos;t know what to say .
what ?
i just got a call from little paulie .
nucci gualtieri died .
stroke on the bus back to the home .
they had gone to see jersey boys .
this is difficult .
this is pain like i &apos;m not used to .
we &apos;ve said before he was like a son in some ways .
to see him
die like that ,
practically in my arms .
he was just starting his life .
yeah .
you know what ?
this is bullshit .
what ?
i haven &apos;t been able to tell anybody this ,
but ... i &apos;m fucking relieved .
really ?
he was a tremendous drag on my emotions ,
on my thoughts about the future .
every morning i wake up thinking ,
ls today the day that one of my best friends is gonna
dime me to the fbl ?
and a weak ,
fucking snivelling , lying drug addict ?
that &apos;s the worst kind of bet .
the biggest blunder of my career is now gone .
and i don &apos;t have to be confronted by that fact no more .
and as a relative , a friend ,
someone you can count on ...
i see .
let me tell you something .
i &apos;ve murdered friends before , even relatives ,
my cousin tony ,
my best friend , puss .
but this ...
was i talking in my sleep ?
snoring .
i &apos;m gonna put on the tv if you don &apos;t mind .
i can &apos;t stay asleep . i &apos;m all ...
can you make me a cappuccino ?
that machine from paulie , you need a pilot &apos;s licence .
it &apos;s so hard not to think of christopher as a child , isn &apos;t it ?
caity kind of looks like him , which makes it doubly hard .
when she hits puberty , that schnoz .
a lot of women found him very attractive .
i think to myself ,
how could i have ever said those things about him ,
about him and adriana , what her mother said he did to her ?
obviously he was violent as an adult , his upbringing ,
but he adored ade .
he could never let himself take her life .
why are we so quick to blame ?
what is the attraction in that ?
it &apos;s good .
thank you .
when i called you ,
that night after the accident ,
and you asked me ,
&quot; oh , my god , tony , he &apos;s dead ? &quot;
yeah .
and i thought ,
well , i thought i picked up a twinge of relief .
i picked up a twinge of relief .
what ?
it just seemed like ... i don &apos;t know ...
you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
ok , good , i &apos;m wrong .
if you did pick up something like that ,
maybe it &apos;s
because i was relieved that it was him and not you .
well , don &apos;t feel bad about that . that makes sense .
to be going down to the hospital again at two in the morning ?
and you know what ? when you were shot ,
it was christopher who held me .
you know the baby &apos;s car seat ?
a giant tree branch came through the window
and demolished it .
she would have been dead , caitlin ,
mangled beyond recognition .
i told her about the baby seat
so she wouldn &apos;t feel so rotten .
he was high as a fucking kite . i didn &apos;t tell her that .
in retrospect , maybe not the best approach .
right . i &apos;m the asshole again .
what ?
no , go ahead .
it &apos;s amazing how things work .
his mother , my cousin joanne ,
a lush .
totally abandoned him as a parent ,
but now she &apos;s reaping all the sympathy
and the tears .
how are you doing , anthony ?
there have been some hard moments .
but a weak ,
lying drug addict who fantasised about my downfall ,
who even showed people his filthy thoughts
on a movie screen ?
let me tell you something . i &apos;ve seen friends die before .
accidents ,
even murder .
my cousin tony , they shot his face away .
and i was fucking prostate with grief .
but this ?
i see .
it occurs to me ,
i hand @-@ carried this kid through the worst crisis he ever had .
i can &apos;t go into particulars ,
but wives , girlfriends ,
they can complicate life in a major way .
i don &apos;t have to tell you that .
anyway , huge problem of his own making .
and he cried . he couldn &apos;t deal with it .
so
i took up the slack . i handled it .
i felt sorry for him .
now he talked gratitude ,
but guess what pity produces in the recipient .
they shit on your pity .
that &apos;s what broke the camel &apos;s back .
how are you handling all this ?
the worst part , truthfully ,
is i gotta sit there
with people who are hurting bad .
and i gotta have the long face
and the sighing and the platitudes .
but i don &apos;t feel it .
then that makes me feel like a hypocrite .
and that makes me mad at them .
hi .
how are you ?
julianna skiffle ,
this is my wife carmela soprano .
skiff .
yeah , right .
julianna &apos;s a real estate agent in the old neighbourhood .
and you knew christopher ?
i used to buy my meat at satriale &apos;s .
i &apos;m a recovering addict .
i owe him a lot .
that &apos;s nice to hear .
well , what are you gonna do ?
nothing you can do .
that &apos;s my point . - he was too young .
he was too young .
good @-@ looking woman .
they did a beautiful job on him .
i &apos;m gonna go up .
i &apos;ll go up later .
give my seat to someone in the meantime .
how are you doing ?
it &apos;s tough .
yeah .
he loved you so much .
yeah ?
well , you know he did .
i &apos;ll go up later .
there she is . three to five , seven to nine .
hy do they call her that ?
she never misses a wake .
oh , lord ! fucking james brown now .
i &apos;m serious . i can &apos;t take it .
it &apos;s all right . we &apos;re here for you .
my god . look at this .
like a movie star .
jackie kennedy .
i &apos;m sorry for the loss of your cousin .
thanks .
me too , bro , me too .
he was a good guy .
don &apos;t let this linger on your head .
you know what i &apos;m talking about .
you know that night ,
a tree limb came in through the car window ,
completely destroyed the baby seat .
tony .
you guys are gonna hang in a while , right ?
we should make an appearance at the other wake .
are we that late ?
good you came .
he &apos;ll appreciate it . - please .
i gotta get out of here .
保罗 . - tone .
thanks for coming .
we are so sorry for your loss , paulie .
how you hanging in , paolucc &apos; ?
as well as can be expected .
must be very hard for you .
i know how close you had become again .
yeah .
not much of a sendoff here .
the room is beautiful , paulie .
nobody &apos;s in it .
what kind of testament is this
to the spirit and generosity of the woman ?
we &apos;re here for you , paulie .
you know that .
it &apos;s a fundamental lack of respect
and i &apos;m never gonna fucking forget it .
people your mother &apos;s age , their friends die off .
she outlived sil ? carlo ?
they &apos;re all over there at your nephew &apos;s .
councilman sirillo was here
three minutes .
people are coming and if they don &apos;t , fuck &apos; em .
i got 500 prayer cards .
carm and i are here .
hat the fuck is that ? nothing ?
no , tone , of course not .
means the world .
ok .
she suffered too , you know .
this isn &apos;t the time or the place .
you &apos;re right .
how have you been dealing with it ?
it &apos;s really sad but it &apos;s kinda the same as with blanca .
i don &apos;t really just keep thinking about things the way i did ,
over and over , you know ?
well , for one thing , perhaps the meds are working .
did you finally enrol ?
i &apos;m in a few classes unofficially ,
until my transcript clears from ramapo .
beginning english .
and i went to a class on
the history of the lsraeli @-@ palestinian conflict .
it &apos;s hard to pick up in the middle . i might take it next semester .
i mean ,
it &apos;s so dicked up over there
and no one knows who started it .
are you sleeping ?
what ? in class ?
no . you were having trouble , remember ?
wellbutrin xl kicks ass .
i &apos;m hearing good things about lexapro .
check it , paisan . long john shithead .
that kid &apos;s in my south american lit class .
he had his toes amputated .
said it was an accident with his car battery .
acid burned through his shoe .
you little shfooyadell .
she should nurse .
at least somebody feels like eating .
she doesn &apos;t know .
isn &apos;t god wonderful that way ?
hello ? alan , it &apos;s tony . you busy ?
usual shit . some japanese guy
got his suit ruined at cirque du soleil .
listen , i need a suite . all the guys coming out ?
no . i &apos;m solo .
we &apos;ll see what we can do about that .
look , i just want to be alone .
peace and quiet . chill out .
you set for transpo ? i &apos;ll be happy to send a plane .
no more bets .
33 black odd .
no more bets .
five red odd .
it &apos;s hard to imagine for a poet ,
but wordsworth was as rich and popular
as , say , someone like
john grisham nowadays .
but wordsworth writes ,
&quot; the world is too much with us . &quot;
later he invokes nature again .
why such strong words against the material world ?
that was fast .
the gatehouse usually
gives shitty directions to the east tower . come in .
so ...
you &apos;re a friend of chris .
yeah . tony , by the way .
no , i know .
he &apos;s mentioned you , actually .
except you &apos;re more beautiful than he let on .
really ? talked about you a few times .
told me more than once to look you up .
did he ?
well , well , well .
you want a drink or something ?
i got some pinot grigio in the fridge .
i got
some serious news .
it &apos;s about christopher .
he &apos;s dead .
what ?
it was a car accident ,
happened a couple of days ago .
oh , my god .
that &apos;s fucking awful .
sorry .
what happened ? bad wreck ,
high speed ...
he was killed instantly .
somehow i walked away .
jesus , that must have been scary .
the fucking sound alone ...
did he ever
marry that one girl , the one who left him ?
no .
found a real sweetheart , though , kelli .
they
just had a baby girl .
i mean ,
bad that he left her ,
but good that he left something .
i thought you should know .
well ...
extremely cool , you coming over here . i appreciate that .
how long you here for ?
i don &apos;t know .
just play it as i go .
what &apos;s up ?
it &apos;s stefano .
i &apos;m sorry to bother you but i &apos;m here at the school .
the asbestos , it &apos;s backing up .
i gotta dump this shit .
it &apos;s not wrapped to code and all the other violations .
yeah ? i could get nailed big time .
we &apos;re working on it , john .
i &apos;m trying to negotiate it out
but the asshole &apos;s taking a hard line .
just hang in there , let me do my thing .
all right .
jeff &apos;ll clean it up .
make him clean it in his bare feet .
i got the venison steaks !
what the fuck ?
you blind ?
me ? you open the door , you don &apos;t look at all .
shit , you wrecked my fucking door .
you did that to your own door .
what the fuck did you say ?
i said he opened the door , he don &apos;t look at all .
look at my fucking bike .
do you hear this guy ? you saw it .
fuck you , nigger .
i am not a nigger .
i am from somalia . i go to school and i work .
do not call me a nigger .
you &apos;re some terrorist piece of shit .
either way , you &apos;re in the wrong neighbourhood .
get the fuck away !
you a tough nigger now ?
you got something to say ?
cocksucker !
do you mind ?
no , knock yourself out .
this is ...
this is the new shit .
medical @-@ grade , mellow ,
paranoia @-@ free .
well , that &apos;s good .
chris loved to party .
what &apos;s your point ?
nothing .
you just remind me of him , obviously .
what &apos;s that mean ? i fuck like him ?
so much for paranoia @-@ free .
no , you were his friend , that &apos;s all .
why would you bring him up ?
all i &apos;m saying is that
there &apos;s a certain kind of guy
that i don &apos;t run into on campus .
but where i dance ,
that accent , the clothes .
i &apos;m a type ?
this coming from the girl who &apos;s stripping her way through college ?
actually , you &apos;re a surprise .
chris sometimes talked about some sad shit ,
but you seem ,
i don &apos;t know , actually sad .
not right now i &apos;m not .
jesus , this is some pretty fucking amazing dope .
chris said you two
took peyote together .
yeah .
i mean , i haven &apos;t done buttons in a while , though .
i &apos;ve been thinking why the fuck i &apos;m here .
you can get to that place .
no , i mean vegas .
truth is i always wanted to try that shit ,
but i always
had all the responsibilities .
you &apos;re a hard man to reach .
nobody &apos;s seen hide nor hair .
i &apos;m away . what do you want ?
what do i want ? i &apos;m returning your call .
this got nothing to do with asbestos .
let go of the old shit and be a businessman .
you got everything you want .
not everything .
but listen ,
allow me to express my condolences regarding your nephew .
this is me hanging up .
i can tell you &apos;re upset .
big fucking deal .
what exactly happened this week ?
nothing .
people walk around like this is all something .
they &apos;re fucking laughing
and nobody takes even one second to think about what &apos;s really going on .
what &apos;s really going on .
you sound depressed again .
how can anybody not be ?
you &apos;d have to be fucking nuts not to be .
you &apos;d have to have your head
wedged so far up your ass
that all you could see is your own stupid face .
what specifically are you talking about ?
i mean , everything is so fucked up .
why can &apos;t we all just get along ?
you don &apos;t have to chew it .
you just wash it down like a pill .
it &apos;s the same principle as the solar system .
no more bets .
24 . yes .
nice .
press it all .
no more bets .
20 .
holy fucking shit .
here
much appreciated .
no more bets .
he &apos;s dead .
what ?
