第十八集
Once upon a time, an evil queen
banished every storybook character you've ever known
to our world.
Who knows the truth
and who can break the spell?
You don't play with the curse.
The evidence is piling up by the hour.
You want me to run?
It's your choice.
Everyone thinks I killed Kathryn.
You have to trust me. I can get you out of this.
I think you'd be well-advised to bring me on as your counsel.
What is she doing here? I made a deal with you, Gold.
Fear not, Your Majesty. You may yet get what you want.
Remembrance of things past?
What do you want?
I need a favor.
You need a favor from me?
Well, as you know,
there are battery charges against me pending.
I really don't relish the thought of spending
any more time locked up in a cage.
Now someone with your influence
can make the D.A. suddenly realize
what a flimsy case they have.
Isn't that right...
Your Majesty?
What do I get out of it?
Help with your Mary Margaret problem.
You see, I've noticed
that no matter how hard you seem to try to stop them,
she and her charming friend
just keep finding ways to be together.
What are you suggesting?
If you want to inflict pain...
then you must inflict pain.
If something tragic...
were to happen to David's wife,
and if Mary Margaret should take the blame--
She'd be ruined.
And you'd have your victory,
at last.
A trial could be very messy.
A trial? Who said anything about a trial?
Now once Ms. Blanchard has been incarcerated,
you can plant one of your lovely skeleton keys in her cell.
And once she tries to leave Storybrooke, well...
we all know what happens
to people that attempt to leave town.
Give me one good reason why I should trust you.
Because I always honor my agreements.
Do we have a deal?
Yes!
That's beautiful, sweetheart.
Oh, thank you, daddy.
Beautiful?
I'd hardly call that beautiful.
You didn't like it, mother?
You ride like a man.
A lady should be graceful.
You should use a saddle.
I was just having fun.
You're getting a little old for fun.
Who's going to want to marry you when you behave like a commoner?
Honey, please leave her alone.
Stop coddling her.
She's becoming an old maid.
All the other girls her age are married.
I had such high hopes.
Milady, perhaps this saddle--
I'm done riding for the day.
And don't ever interrupt me and my mother again.
Why do you always have to criticize me?
I'm not criticizing you.
I'm helping you.
Don't you walk away from me.
Mother!
You know I don't like it when you use magic.
And I don't like insolence.
I'll stop using magic
when you start being an obedient daughter.
Why can't I just be myself?
Oh, because you can be so much more
if you'd just let me help you.
I don't care about status.
I just want to be--oh!
Cora, please.
Please.
I'll be good.
Excellent.
That's all I wanted to hear.
Daniel...
I'm sorry I snapped at you.
That's all right.
You'll just have to find some way to make it up to me.
Emma.
David, I don't have time.
No, I-I understand.
It's Mary Margaret. How's she doing?
How do you think she's doing?
Well, I think the last time we spoke,
she didn't quite get what I meant.
Oh, you mean that you basically told her
you thought she might be guilty?
Look, it's this situation.
It's been confusing and horrible for everyone.
But, Emma, I don't think she's guilty.
I need her to know that.
Can I see her?
She doesn't want visitors.
You mean me. She doesn't want to see me.
Honestly, David, I'm sure your heart is in the right place,
but the last thing she needs right now is
words of encouragement from you.
What does she need?
A miracle.
They say only the guilty sleep in prison.
What are you doing here?
Where's Emma?
She hasn't arrived yet.
I just wanted to stop by to offer you a chance--
A chance to spare yourself and this town the messiness of a trial,
the chance to confess.
But I didn't kill Kathryn.
Why won't anyone believe me?
The murder weapon was found in your apartment.
Your fingerprint was on the box containing Kathryn's heart.
Shall I go on?
Why not, for once,
make it easier on everyone?
Because confession or not,
you're leaving Storybrooke.
And you like that.
Why?
Why do you take such pleasure in this?
What did I ever do to you to make you hate me so much?
I thought we could take a ride to firefly hill.
We can make it by sundown, have a picnic.
I can't. I have to be back in an hour.
Tea time.
A lady never misses her tea time.
This is absurd.
Stealing kisses between lunch and tea?
When are you gonna tell your parents about us?
It's not my parents.
It's her.
I don't understand.
So I work in the stables.
She started out as the daughter of a miller.
Wouldn't she, of all people, understand?
She does.
But she thinks one's trajectory needs to keep moving up and--
And I'm down.
She believes that. Daniel...
I know better.
Regina, tell her.
She'll get over it. What can she do?
Have you not seen her magic?
The real question is what can't she do?
Who cares about magic?
True love is the most powerful magic of all.
It can overcome anything.
Help!
Someone's here.
Somebody, help me!
Come on, please, stop! Help me!
Help! Help me! Please help me!
Give me your hand!
It's okay, dear. You're safe.
You saved my life.
Are you all right?
Yes.
But I'll never ride again.
Nonsense.
The only way to overcome fear is to face it,
to get back on that horse as soon as possible.
Thank you.
Regina.
I'm Snow.
Snow White.
A pretrial interview with the prosecution?
Explain to me how that is a good idea.
The D.A. merely wishes to ask Ms. Blanchard a few questions.
She's done answering questions.
And why are we kissing up to the D.A.?
Why aren't we going after Regina?
She's the one who's setting up Mary Margaret.
And what proof do we have of that, sheriff?
Just because you found the mayor's skeleton key
in the cell doesn't mean we can prove she put it there.
So what's your plan?
I believe our best chance of winning this case
is to employ our most valuable asset.
What's that?
Well, that's you, dear.
A sweet, kind elementary schoolteacher.
Doesn't exactly fit the prototype of a killer, now does it?
That's how you're gonna get her acquitted?
By using her personality?
Perception is everything, Ms. Swan--
not just in the courtroom, but in life.
As such, I'm sure you can imagine
how the jury would perceive Ms. Blanchard
if she agreed to cooperate with the district attorney.
These things engender trust.
It shows the jury she's at least trying--
Emma?
Oh, I'm sorry to interrupt.
I just, uh, came by to drop these off.
I thought they might brighten the place up.
What did you find?
Nothing.
I- I'm sorry, Emma. I tried. I really did.
I looked into her phone records.
I talked to the people at the toll bridge.
But look, what can I say?
Regina knows how to cover her tracks.
What about the murder weapon?
You find anything tying her to that?
From what I can tell, she never bought or owned a hunting knife.
That's all you were able to uncover?
Don't worry. I'm gonna keep digging,
and I won't stop until I do find something.
I'm gonna do it.
I'm going to talk to the D.A.
Are you sure?
Mr. Gold's right.
I know I have nothing to hide, but no one else does.
I need to let people see me for who I am.
Excellent decision, Ms. Blanchard.
My name is Spencer. I'm the district attorney.
Shall we begin?
Yeah.
After she learned about your affair, Mrs. Nolan, the deceased,
came to your school to confront you. Is that correct?
She was hurt, and she felt betrayed.
She struck you--
in the face, was it?
Yes, but--
That must've made you angry.
You-- you don't have to answer that.
No, it's okay.
I was not angry.
I was sorry for all the pain I had caused her.
Ms. Blanchard,
this is not a courtroom. I'm not here to judge you.
You can be honest with me.
Shall we end this?
I am being honest with you.
The wife of the man you loved
humiliated you in a public forum.
Surely you must have felt some anger towards Kathryn.
Yes, I was angry--
And did you ever think about acting upon that anger?
Of course not.
I have a hard time believing that.
Wh-why?
Because you wanted Kathryn Nolan gone.
I never said that.
All right.
My client is answering no more questions for the day.
Your client agreed to this interview
because she claimed she had nothing to hide.
I don't have anything to hide.
Then what is your answer?
You wanted Kathryn gone, didn't you?
No.
Even after she tried to keep you and David apart?
After she slapped you in public?
After she made you a pariah in your own town?
Yes, of course I wanted her gone.
She was the only thing keeping us apart,
so yeah, I wanted her gone. Is that what you wanna hear?
No, this won't do.
What are you doing?
We have a guest. He'll be here any moment.
I can't. I have a riding lesson with Daniel.
Well, that's been canceled.
Now smile. We don't want to disappoint him.
Disappoint who?
The king.
The king?
Why is the king coming?
Because you've finally done something right.
That little girl you saved is the king's daughter.
Is that her?
Yes.
Regina, honey,
This is Snow White's father.
No.
It is I who should bow to you.
You saved my daughter's life.
There is no way to repay that debt.
It is an honor to meet you.
Regina, dear, the king's honored to meet you.
Say something.
The honor is mine.
You're quite lucky to have a mother who looks out for you.
My dear Snow has many things,
but a mother is not one of them.
We lost her years ago.
I'm so sorry.
Since then I have scoured the land looking for a wife.
I've yet to find a woman with an interest in my daughter...
until now.
Will you marry me, Regina?
Yes.
Yes.
Daniel?
Daniel!
What is it?
Marry me.
Regina, what are you doing?
What's happened? Did you tell your mother?
No. Now I can never tell her.
She won't understand.
That girl I saved
was the king's daughter.
And now he's proposed to me.
What?
My mother accepted!
The only way out is to run.
For us to leave this place,
for us to be married, for us to never come back.
Regina...
Do you understand what that would mean?
Life with a stable boy
is a far cry from a life as queen.
Being queen means nothing.
Daniel...
All I care about is you.
Then if I am to marry you,
we must do this properly.
Here.
Snow!
Dear, what are you doing?
You said to get back on the horse and...
What are you doing with him?
Snow, I can explain.
No.
No. Snow! Snow!
Snow!
Snow! Wait!
Snow!
Snow!
Are you okay?
No.
No.
Why were you kissing that man in the stable?
You're to marry my father.
You're to be my mother.
Oh, Snow, please, listen to me.
Your father,
King Leopold-- he's a kind and fair man...
But I don't love him.
I don't understand.
Why not?
Love doesn't work that way.
Love...
true love...
is magic.
And not just any magic--
the most powerful magic of all.
It creates happiness.
And that man in the stables...
You love him?
With all my heart.
Then you must marry him.
I will go tell father right away.
N-no. No. No. No. You can't.
Why not?
Surely he'll understand.
Perhaps, but not everyone will.
My mother, for one-- she'll stand in the way.
That's why you're running.
It's the only way our love can survive.
Snow, do you know what a secret is?
If you really, truly want to help me...
I do.
Then what you saw, what I told you,
you must keep it a secret.
Can you do that?
I think so.
I need you to be certain.
You can never speak of this.
And above all, you mustn't tell my mother.
Will you do that for me?
Yes.
I promise.
What you doing?
Grasping at straws.
Still trying to find a way
to prove your friend's been framed?
Every time I go down a path I think leads somewhere,
it ends up being a dead end.
I used to think I had these great instincts...
superpower. Now I don't know.
It sounds like you got a case of writer's block,
only without the whole writing part.
Maybe.
You know, when I get struck by a block,
I usually reread what I've done
rather than plow ahead blindly.
Sometimes I find there'll be
a little nugget of inspiration left behind.
You mean start over?
I mean, when I start writing, I usually have one idea,
and then in the middle, I may get another idea,
and things are different.
So your perspective changes.
Exactly.
When you started this investigation,
what was it about?
A missing person.
Then it became a murder
and then a cover-up.
If you knew that then,
maybe you would have approached things differently.
Where you going?
Scene of the crime.
I'll drive.
No, I'm fine.
No, you're not. You haven't slept in days.
And let's be honest,
it was my idea.
Ruby found the box with the heart right over here,
just by the shore.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
It doesn't seem like nothing.
Here. Let me look.
No, it's okay.
It's just a shin splint. Just let me walk it off.
Sorry.
I know this must be hard on you.
Yeah, that's an understatement.
I don't know you that well,
but it seems to me, that aside from Henry,
Mary Margaret's the closest thing to family you've got.
It's okay to admit it.
August, look.
What is it?
It's a shard.
From a shovel.
Must've broken off when it hit a rock.
If we can find the shovel that it broke off of,
we can prove that Mary Margaret didn't bury the heart.
We can prove that she's innocent.
And I'm gonna guess you know exactly whose shovel it is.
The eagle is in the nest,
and the package is secure.
Henry.
I left the code book at home.
She's getting in the shower
and the keys are under the mat.
Don't touch a thing.
We got her.
Careful, sweetheart.
A flower is a delicate thing.
Be gentle.
You want it to grow
and not pluck it before its time.
Sorry.
It's all right.
You needn't fear me. I'm only trying to help.
Perhaps you could be the flower girl at the wedding.
I can already see how close you and Regina have become.
She's going to make a fine mother for you.
She is kind to me.
Indeed.
It warms my heart how you two share everything...
Already.
Perhaps you could share something with me.
Why has she pulled away from me?
What do you mean?
A mother knows her daughter.
Regina's pulled away.
I love her so much, but she's not letting me help her,
and I... I know she's unhappy.
Has she said something?
I'd do anything to make her happy.
You'd do anything?
Of course, dear.
You know, I've talked to the king about your mother.
He told me how much she loved you.
Losing her must've been so hard.
It was.
Hearing him, I realized he might as well have been talking
about me and regina.
I don't want us to lose each other.
If only I could show her how I feel,
that no matter what, all I want is her happiness.
Then don't make her get married.
I'm sorry?
She doesn't love my father.
She loves someone else.
She made me promise not to tell.
But she'll lose you.
She can't lose her mother.
No one should.
Oh, sweet Snow, it's all right.
She won't lose me.
You can tell me.
You must tell me.
Can I help you, sheriff Swan?
Yes. I need you to unlock the garage for me.
And why would I do that?
Because I have a search warrant that says that you have to.
On what grounds?
I found this near where the heart was buried,
figured whoever buried it might have left something behind.
Then I got an anonymous call from someone
who said they saw you digging near the toll bridge
the day the heart was found.
An "anonymous call"?
Yeah. Well, I can't control the fact he didn't leave a name.
I suppose he didn't want to risk pissing you off.
Now open the garage or I'll find a way to do it myself.
Where is it?
Where is what, sheriff?
You knew I was coming.
How on earth would I know that?
Mary Margaret is a good person. She doesn't deserve this.
Ms. Blanchard is a liar and a murderer.
No matter what accusations you throw my way,
that won't change.
She's going to pay for what she's done.
That woman has destroyed
the last life she is ever going to destroy.
How could you do this?
How could you do this to me? To Mary Margaret?
Slow down. Do what?
The shovel was gone when I got there.
Regina knew I was coming for it.
You--you think that I told her?
You were the only other person who knew about it.
I would hope that you would have enough faith
to know that I would never betray you.
Why should I? How do I know you're not lying about this?
About everything?
I'm not a liar.
That is exactly what a liar would say.
Having a bad day?
What are you doing here?
I wanted to see you while I can.
What does that mean?
Simply that the trial starts tomorrow,
and it won't be a long one,
and you'll be sent out of Storybrooke for good,
and I will never have to see you again.
Oh, I want to enjoy this while I still can.
Enjoy what?
Justice.
Justice?
Watching an innocent suffer?
You've always seen yourself that way, haven't you?
Innocent.
I am innocent!
I don't know what this is about!
I don't know what I ever did to you,
but whatever it was, Regina...
I'm sorry.
I truly am.
Apology not accepted.
Please. Don't do this to me.
I don't deserve this. I did not kill Kathryn.
Oh, I know.
But you do deserve this.
Are you ready?
Let's go.
You could've at least left a note.
Mother, I--
Don't.
You sneak out of my house in the dead of night
and think I won't notice? How dare you.
You're impossible to talk to.
Stop with the magic and listen to me.
I want to be with Daniel.
Oh, you don't know what you want,
but I do.
I didn't make the sacrifices I did in life
to get you to the cusp of greatness
so that you could end up the wife of a stable boy.
But it's my life.
You foolish girl.
It's mine.
After what I had to do--
the deals I had to make to get us out of poverty,
to get us this life,
and you just want to toss it away?
Stay strong, Regina.
Your magic can't keep us apart.
I love him.
And I love her.
And I love her, too.
If you loved me, you wouldn't try to keep us apart.
And if you loved me, you wouldn't try to run away.
I'm sorry, but this is my happiness.
We're going.
No.
You're not.
So what's your plan?
You're going to keep us here forever?
Because that's what you'll have to do.
So this is...
your decision?
This will make you happy?
It already has.
Then who am I to stop you?
Thank you, mother.
Daniel.
If you want to have a life together, a family...
then there's one important lesson I can impart on you.
It's what it means to be a parent.
You always have to do what's best for your children.
Thank you.
I understand.
Because that's what you're doing now.
Yes. It is.
Mother!
No!
No! No. No. No. No. No.
Mother, why have you done this?
Because this is your happy ending.
What?
Oh, you have to trust me, Regina.
I know best.
Love is weakness, Regina.
It feels real now. At the start, it always does.
But it's an illusion.
It fades,
and then you're left with nothing.
But power...
True power endures.
And then you don't have to rely on anyone to get what you want.
I've saved you, my love.
You've ruined everything.
I loved him.
I loved him!
Enough!
I've endured this long enough.
Now clean yourself up,
wipe away your tears,
because now...
you're going to be queen.
You are most certainly the fairest of them all!
Thank you, dear.
I hope for my wedding day I will be as beautiful.
I'm sure you will be.
I know you and Daniel will be so happy together.
What?
Well, I just knew your mother would let you marry him,
once she knew how happy it'd make you,
once she knew how much you love him.
You have such a wonderful mother.
She would do anything for your happiness.
Snow...
Did...
Did you... tell her
about me and daniel?
Yes.
But I told you...
very specifically not to.
I'm sorry.
I just didn't want you to lose your mother,
like I've lost mine.
Are you mad?
No.
I'm not mad at all.
You were just trying to help me.
However, I'm not marrying Daniel.
This dress is for your father.
But... I thought...
you were in love.
So did I.
But I was wrong.
Daniel has run away.
What I had with Daniel wasn't real.
It was an infatuation.
You see, that's the thing about love.
It can come in the most unexpected places.
Your father and I have something even more special
because it's not just about the two of us.
It's about all of us.
We're going to be a family.
We are?
That's right.
I'm going to be your stepmother, and I couldn't be happier.
Me, too.
Snow, you need to go to your room and help with the packing.
Your father wants you ready for the journey,
and we're heading to your castle first thing in the morning.
You're both going to love it there.
I know we will.
Well-played, dear.
You're learning.
I should change.
I wouldn't want to ruin the dress before my big day.
I am so proud of you.
You knew the king was traveling through our land, didn't you?
That steed with Snow on it--
It didn't go wild on its own.
Did it?
I have no idea what you're saying.
I should've let her die on that horse.
We got her, Daniel.
We got her.
Mary Margaret.
You told me you could fix this.
That's why I came to you.
So that you could make sure Regina didn't win.
She hasn't yet.
Well, she's going to,
and now my friend is gonna pay for me trusting you.
Look, sheriff, I know this is emotional,
but it's also not over.
You must have faith. There's still time.
Time for what?
For me to work a little magic.
I'm sorry.
For what?
For doubting you.
I made a mistake.
What's that?
Evidence.
Evidence that proves
that I've been trusting all the wrong people.
I should have listened to you.
This bug was from Sidney.
The newspaper guy?
I should've seen it.
Well, don't beat yourself up about it, Emma.
Sometimes it's hard to see what's right in front of us,
but I knew you would.
I'm trying.
Ruby!
What's going on?
She--she--she's in the alley.
Who, Ruby? What happened?
Hey, you all right?
