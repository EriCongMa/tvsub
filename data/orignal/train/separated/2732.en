How much blood will you shed to stay alive Michael?
Live or die make your choice.
Who the fuck are you?
What the fuck you doing in there?
We're gonna miss the previews.
What?
Tell me your earring went in the fucking drain again.
I'm pregnant.
I know it's my fault. I know I shouldn't have let you take off the rubber.
I thought we were okay. I was due for my period.
My cycle's like clockwork.
Stop.
I'll call the clinic tomorrow.
Stop talking.
Let's get married.
What?
We'll drive to A. C. make a day out of it.
Are you serious?
Christopher. I love you.
My baby.
Yeah.
My ex she couldn't have kids and I wanted 'em so bad.
The one who ran out on you?
You can bet she's having some other asshole's kid though.
That fucking tramp.
Elzear patron saint of zeppoles.
Could use a shot of lacquer.
Fix that halo too.
Shh!
Hello.
Mr. Gaultieri I'm Father Jose.
I'm Mr. Gaultieri. Where's Father Felix?
Unfortunately he's ill.
He's having bypass surgery. He asked me to fill in.
You know Mr. Russamano from the Neighborhood Association.
Sure Paulie Chuck how you feeling?
He was an altar boy.
Ahh.
So the Feast of St. Elzear.
Father Felix brought me up to speed.
I'd like to hear your ideas for this year.
Well there ain't much to talk about.
It's all done through our nonprofit corporation.
We close the streets for five days
hire the food vendors rides et cetera.
Day two we start the procession
push the statue up and down the block.
You say a couple of prayers and that's that.
All's said and done you get your end.
About that as I was telling Mr. Russamano
frankly $10000 struck me as quite low.
It is what it is.
Look I'm new here. I certainly don't wanna rock the boat.
I realize there are certain neighborhood traditions.
It's just that given the current costs we feel an increase
is long overdue.
What kind of increase?
We feel $50000 would be a more equitable donation.
50?
Just this year we started a soup kitchen for the homeless
a reading program for bilingual children.
There's less help than ever from the federal government.
You think this feast pays for itself?
Security electric sanitation.
Not to mention fuel costs.
Yeah.
The way it seems to break down is you spend $18
for a city permit to close down the street
charge fees to the vendors
in the thousands of dollars to lease out land
that you don't even own.
Yeah? Well it seems to me the church has plenty in its coffers
for all those pedophilia lawsuits.
The parish's deal was negotiated since
this was Johnny Soprano's feast.
These are different times Mr. Gaultieri.
Well some things don't change.
Couple of days
Joe Vella from the Honor Guard will be by with the float.
Transfer the statue from his niche
pick up the hat and other stuff.
You say things don't change.
This feast was started over 100 years ago
in a spirit of giving.
Italian immigrants the working poor
gave what little money they had to honor St. Elzear.
He's the patron saint from my grandparent's town
Ariano di Puglia.
Many of those folks gave their gold wedding bands which were melted
down to make the saint's hat.
Yeah?
The Holy Society of St. Elzear
of which you are recording secretary
has for the past 100 years entrusted us
with the care of that habiliment.
Frankly...
I don't feel safe giving it over this year.
We use it every year. It's part of the tradition.
I understand but I'm sorry.
Given the tenor of this conversation I sense there's a possible
criminal element in this neighborhood
that could endanger this precious piece of local history.
But for 50 grand you wouldn't have that sense.
It would demonstrate to me that you take this feast as seriously
as the people who began it.
Okay Father nice meeting you.
Fuck the hat!
It's fucking bullshit.
I got a fax from Eddie Lind Allegheny Carting.
They wanna raise the tipping fee again on solid waste.
Just the man I wanted to see.
I gotta go down to Pennsylvania and I'm gonna need backup.
I'm busy managing the feast.
Vice president in charge of calzones.
Where the fuck you been anyway?
ls that what I think it is?
You are now looking at a newly married man.
Ho ho holy shit!
Kelli?
What the fuck brought this on?
Visit from the stork coming up.
You never heard of pulling out?
Sweetheart little Cristal over here.
You know what you're having?
Boy I hope.
I tell ya T with the example you set
plus the wisdom I learned from AA
it's an inspiration--building blocks
home family.
Yeah that's what it's all about kid.
Just water for me.
My son will be my strength.
Yeah.
I did?
What are you new in the office?
Talk to Dr. Cipolla.
I don't pay for missed appointments.
To the baby.
To the baby.
Salut.
Salut.
Make a note to call Freddie at DiSorbo's.
He wants to sponsor the cannoli-eating contest
I better see an envelope by tomorrow.
Anyway my guy at the weigh station's on board.
You know how to get back right?
I MapBlasted it.
All right see you guys.
Look Pittsburgh.
What the fuck? We're supposed to be headed east.
Are we. 7 miles past Route 62 yet?
I gotta take a piss.
You seeing this?
Looks like bikers.
Wooden crates.
It's good wine.
What the fuck?
Who the fuck are you guys?
That's who I am you mangy cocksucker.
Take it easy.
On the ground or I'll blow your greasy fucking heads off.
You guys cops?
How's your incision Lieutenant?

Shut up fucking douchebag.
Let's go.
Get him!
Ow!
I hit him! I fucking hit him!
Fuck you!
Yee-ha!
That was fucking awesome. Fucking old-school shit.
Opportunity knocked.
Knocked? Kicked the fucking door in.
Oh fuck!
You okay T?
Fucking ankle I guess I sprained it.
You smell that? It's fucking autumn.
It's like the first fall night
when you're a kid and the air's all crisp
and you start smelling people's fireplaces.
Smells like Halloween.
Ha ha!
Oh...
Chateau Pichon-Longueville 1986.
'86--ooh baby.
Show me the money.
What's your corkage fee?
How about that prick's face when he saw the gat?
The Grizzly Adams motherfucker?
"Whoa take it easy."
"We're with the Vipers."
How's that wine good?
It really is I gotta say.
I tell ya though
when he pulled that trigger
I almost shit myself.
Yeah.
I miss it sometimes. I'll be honest.
The wine.
You should toast to your wedding at least.
Your kid.
Discipline that's all.
Set limits for myself.
On the other side they consider wine food.
Oh yeah?
Salut.
Salut.
I'm gonna have to sleep on my back.
What are you doing?
Nightcap.
There's a Swiss Army in the console.
When you think of the shit we've been through huh?
Shit we've done.
Fucking Three Musketeers.
We got a bond.
It's very special.
You saved my life in a lot of ways.
You've been there for me too you know?
Don't think I don't know that.
There were times
it was hard with me and you.
I didn't understand.
You were young.
Stubborn.
You always had my back though.
Like that day when I came to the house.
I gotta talk to you.
What's wrong?
What's the matter?
You know I've always been loyal to you T.
What are you trying to tell me Christopher?
I can't even say it.
Oh fuck.
Adriana.
What about her?
The feds.
Jesus-fucking-Christ.
How long?
How fucking long?
A year I don't know.
When did you find out?
She just told me last night.
What do they know huh?
What did she give 'em?
I don't know.
Might take a lot.
Ralphie?
I don't know.
Oh Tony how could you even think that?
Where is she?
Where the fuck is she? Where is she?
Please Ton'.
Where is she?
She's home.
I can't. I can't do it Ton'.
No please don't make me do it.
I can't do it. I can't do it.
All right.
I can't.
All right.
I can't do it.
I'm gonna take care of it.
All right.
Come on come on.
Now listen to me.
You go upstairs.
You go out the back door.
Don't talk to Carmela.
You go someplace have a cup of coffee.
You wait till I call you.
Huh?
It's okay. We're gonna take care of it.
Go ahead.
I love you man.
I love you too.
I like it.
Welcome.
Joan Gillespie Pagano Realty.
Kelli Moltisanti.
We spoke on the phone. My husband Christopher.
How do you do?
This is what I'm talking about.
"Stately Wayne Manor."
Four bedrooms marble baths with Kohler fixtures.
Sub-Zero in the stainless steel kitchen. We'll take it.
He's what we call an impulse buyer.
Shouldn't we see the inside first sweetie?
If it has an inside we're buying it.
Where's the rest? Five days rent in advance I said.
What if it rains? Ohio State Fair gives you a rebate for bad weather.
Yet another reason I don't live in Ohio.
Easy on the sugar hon'. They tell me I'm sweet enough.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Jesus Christ what did he do now?
It's an old polo injury.
Huh?
Let me talk to you a minute.
Couple of guys we know
Lebanese or some shit
they diverted a truck whole semi-trailer full of Centrum Multivitamins.
That's a fucking score.
Yeah the thing is it's gotta be unloaded out of state
'cause the troopers are on it. You interested?
Could be distributed in Long Island.
What's my end?
50-50 but it's gotta be done now tonight.
Tonight?
All right but in this case
I'm thinking we spare John the stress of having to hear about this.
The situation he's in he's got enough to deal with.
Get me Frankie Cosme on the cell.
Yeah somebody wants to talk to you. Hold on.
Did you pray?
Said a "thank you" for Daddy's recovery.
You had arthroscopic surgery you can't bend a knee?
Dad said he's gonna meet us on the corner.
Isn't that Ade's mom?
Oh my God. She looks terrible.
Who?
Chris' ex her mom.
She saw us. I should say hello.
Liz hi.
I saw you're on the committee. That's so great.
Carmela Soprano.
How's your daughter?
Fine.
Well mine is dead.
Oh my God when? What happened?
When? That piece of shit your nephew.
They broke up Liz. She ran off.
She doesn't call me for almost two years.
My birthday Christmas.
You two always did have a very difficult relationship.
The FBI came to my home.
You'd be amazed at the questions they asked me.
Liz They admitted they think that he killed her.
Come on Liz you're drunk.
Drunk? It's called depression.
I haven't had a drink in years.
There were times I was a kid
my friend Ronnie we'd play on the floor of my kitchen...
linoleum Matchbox cars or whatever.
He'd go home his fucking knees would be filthy.
His elbows... she never cleaned my mother.
Fucking house was a pigsty.
Ronnie's mother made him stop coming over it was so dirty.
That's fucked up.
Embarrassing.
My kid it'll be different.
He'll be proud of his house.
Wait till you see this place.
So that thing Rusty Milio
I heard that happened.
Good job.
It's a little less cash than we talked about.
But there's a bonus in there for you.
It's okay if I fix?
Just take me to my car.
Rock out with your cock out.
Fireplace parquet floors
bumper pool table in the basement.
Huh?
The house I'm getting.
You'll come over.
Christmas Christmas Eve maybe.
I'm gonna start a tradition.
You know you really gotta get yourself some help with this shit.
I will. I'm gonna.
Those fucking works though.
Whets my whistle that spike. Why is that?
I don't know.
You want some?
Me? Nah.
Okay it's just you know if you want.
Guess I could toot some.
I remember...
when I did a lot of blow
I used to get diarrhea
just from the smell of paper money...
in a store any fucking place
on account of all the baby laxative in the coke
when you actually snort it.
I meant what I said though
you need to get your ass to rehab.
Fucking Narcotics Anonymous or some shit.
How do you like this car?
It's nice the leather.
See ya.
Here he comes.
God bless you St. Elzear.
Where's his gold hat?
Pray for my mother St. Elzear.
Hey they forgot his hat.
This is my nephew George just back from Iraq.
Two tours he done.
I'm proud of you my friend.
What do you need?
I don't know.
There's prosciutto in there some leftover sesame noodles.
Tofu would make your doctor happy.
How's the ankle?
It's better.
Cold packs helped.
Did you have the riser fixed?
Yeah yeah Brian Spatafore was over the Pork Store.
Had him tighten up the banister everything.
You all right?
I have been debating all night whether
to even say anything about this.
I ran into Liz La Cerva at the feast.
Yeah...
She's got it in her head
that Christopher killed Adriana.
What? That's insane.
I know.
Then again he does have a history of being free with his hands.
That makes him O.J.?
She was probably drunk.
I really don't think she was.
Let me school you on domestic violence okay?
First and foremost there's always a body.
And 99 out of 100
and this comes straight from my cop buddies...
it happens either in the bedroom or in the kitchen.
He killed her
believe me with the forensics they got nowadays
the fibers we'd know about it.
The FBI came to her house Liz.
That's exactly my point. If they really thought he did it
how fast do you think they'd haul his ass in?
Sour grapes Carm.
He dumps her daughter all of a sudden he's Scott fucking Peterson.
I thought Ade dumped him.
You know what I mean.
She was a sweet girl Ade but the two of them together was a toxic relationship.
Yeah they did have a rough time of it.
And he's doing great Christopher.
He's a different person.
He's married. He's got a kid on the way.
He's focused.
Let's not sabotage his progress.
Hmm?
Have a dozen extra large brought over to Satriale's.
Hello.
Paul Dr. Cipolla.
I'm on my way out. I received the results of your PSA test.
And?
Not to worry.
But the numbers are a little higher than I prefer.
What does that mean?
Probably nothing.
Likelihood is prostatitis simple inflammation.
You have a history of prostate cancer in your family?
Father maybe?
I don't know.
Well I'd like to go ahead and schedule you for a biopsy.
This is lame. I wanna go on the Octopus.
Can you stop for one minute breaking my balls?
When your father gets back from the bathroom with Sophia
you can go on whatever.
It's a kiddie ride.
Yeah but she wants to go on the ride with her big brother.
Here we go! You ready baby?
Go for a ride with Mama?
This is too small. I'll be all squished.
Yeah so you go sit in that one and wave to her.
Oh there's my girl.
There's my girl!
Yeah are you ready to go on the ride with Mama?
Are you ready? Get ready.
Yeah we're gonna go soon.
Oh here we go!
All around the floor.
Wipe that puss off your face.
My baby!
Oh my God call an ambulance!
Excuse me!
It's okay. It's okay.
This is a temperature gun.
217 degrees.
Look at that.
Yeah.
Paulie it's me.
We had a problem down here. The ride
the Teacups or whatever
a bolt busted. Thing jammed up.
Some people got hurt.
Where's the guy who owns it?
He's talking to the cops.
Fine fuck it. What do you want from me?
It's pretty bad Paulie. Lady broke her wrist.
Some Puerto Rican kid lost some teeth.
What am I a fucking dentist?
I don't know. I thought you'd want to know.
Maybe come down or something.
I gotta be up in the morning. I got my fucking biopsy.
All right I'll take care of it.
Now's your last chance to take advantage...
One second you're sitting there
enjoying a ride with your family
the next your entire world comes crashing down.
I close my eyes. I can still hear the screams.
We should all be thankful it's okay.
My baby could have been killed Tony.
God forbid.
You can bet the locals will be parading in with their lawsuits.
Just leave it alone Janice.
They are entitled to damages.
Obviously there was negligence.
Good so then they'll have excuses why they can't go to work.
When I think
what could have happened to my baby...
Oh yes you Nica.
I'm talking about you angel.
Oh God I wanna bite those cheeks.
Scumbag hillbilly I should have kicked his ass.
Yeah and what did you do? Nothing.
I was taking Sophia to the bathroom.
Mmm this wine Tony you're right.
Delicious.
I was just thinking it lost some of its...
I don't know--pop.
Manager. You gotta move your car.
I said I'm coming.
You redneck fuck. My baby was on that ride with my wife.
She woke up this morning she could barely move her neck.
I told the cops mister. I'm sorry
Insurance will pay your hospital bill.
$25000 cash.
What?
New Jersey has stringent liability laws.
I told the guy who hired me I'd have to put on
a whole repair crew work 'em all night. He wouldn't spring for it.
Who Paulie? What are you talking about?
First off he wouldn't pay for my "A" fleet.
I leased that to the Sorghum Festival down in Atlanta.
Okay the results of the steroid test are in.
The contestants they're all clean.
I want a fair contest here.
No biting each other.
Ready set mangia.
Man we got some race going on over here ladies and gents.
Look at 'em go.
Hey cocksucker!
You hire some fly-by-night piece of shit
and you don't tell nobody?
Whoa Bobby.
What the fuck you talking about?
You know what I'm talking about you cheap fuck! Bobby come on!
Everybody wants to get rich but you don't scrimp on safety.
Mind your business Bobby
My baby girl was in that car!
You owe me money Paulie.
I owe you shit.
My wife's got nerve damage!
Fuck her too!
Get the fuck off me!
Easy easy.
Calm down. Keep moving.
Go ahead it's over. Crown the winner.
I was at the feast St. Elzear's.
The thing for us kids was to blow powdered sugar
on each other from the zeppoles.
Thousands of people either praying or eating.
Anyway my sister was on this ride
with my niece when it lurched forward
pretty bad.
God.
He wasn't there just Elzear.
But he was so busy getting money pinned to his ass
that he got distracted and a bolt snapped.
Were they hurt?
You look around all these people are lined up for this shit.
The kids adults families.
Rides.
Yeah they pay money so they can almost puke.
They scream they yell.
Why do you think that is?
They're bored.
Are you bored?
Am I bored?
I got shot in the pancreas and I recovered.
No brain damage from the septic shock
like everybody figured I'd have.
You know my feelings. Every day is a gift.
It's just...
does it have to be a pair of socks?
I'm joking.
I'm joking.
Well what are you gonna do?
It's the human condition.
What is?
I don't know.
Yeah this is Peter Gaultieri.
I'm calling for the result of my biopsy again.
I'm sorry sir. They're still not in.
This is cancer we're talking about.
I understand sir. You'll have to call back tomorrow.
Gimme an espresso...
and don't touch the lemon rind with your fingers.
Hello Paulie.
What are you doing here?
The home. It's one of our outings.
So you're still over there huh?
They've been very nice
and your brother's trying to work out an arrangement.
ls it true what they're saying?
Who? About what?
The ride the one that broke.
You need to make a novena Paulie.
Those poor children.
What are you talking about?
You let St. Elzear go without his hat.
Will you listen to this? Fuck that voodoo huh?
You cursed your mother a blessed nun.
She had it coming. You both did.
I didn't bring you up like that.
You're a fake. That's how you brung me up.
Fuck the two of you.
Sir your espresso.
So in keeping with this longstanding tradition
of doing everything ass-fucking-backwards
we are gathered here tonight for the bachelor party
Christopher Moltisanti
And like I always say
a man is not complete till he's married.
Then he's finished.
Chrissy.
Congratulations. T.
Thanks.
Should we order?
Yeah what the fuck are the specials?
Artie.
I gotta go Ton'. The kids.
Have fun tonight huh?
All right.
Specials gentlemen.
Pray tell my good man.
I got lamb tonight grilled garlic little rosemary.
Rosemary I'll eat her.
Hey T.
You're doing a heck of a job there Brownie.
Huh?
This thing with the ride the shit with Bobby
you settle it and you settle it now.
And not just 'cause she's my sister either.
Ton' I---You put little kids in jeopardy
in the hands of some fucking redneck?
Not to mention you leave Little Paulie alone to deal with the cops.
I thought he had it under control.
Let me ask you a question about the feast.
Do we need negative press?
With all the competition out there
for the entertainment dollar DVDs
the Internet?
You're right Ton'.
What happened to the regular ride guy
the guy we used last year?
For what he wanted to charge I'm getting killed here Ton'.
When your dad had St. Elzear's it was a cash cow
and it was easy. Nowadays between paying the church
these Puerto Ricans now
ha my profit's shrunk to nothing.
If it don't work as a business get rid of it.
Not for nothing but a lot of that feast goes in your pocket.
I got a lot on my mind T.
I'm sorry.
Like what?
I had a biopsy.
I might have prostate cancer.
Well it's a biopsy right?
Nine times out of 10 these things come back clean.
I don't know.
What don't you know?
Don't work yourself up into a state like you do hmm?
I've been having headaches.
I'm afraid maybe the thing metastasized.
Jesus will you listen to yourself huh?
With all your weird fucking shit about your body and the germophobias.
You don't know shit yet.
It's true.
I'd rather face 10 guys with shivs
than something I can't see.
Exactly. You're too susceptible to the psychics
and the dream messages and dirty fucking toilet seats.
It's a biopsy.
Get a grip.
You're right T.
You know and negative thinking can help bring this shit on.
Work something out with Bobby huh?
And Eddie Lind's coming down from Pennsylvania with an envelope.
Meet him at the Bing.
You call him you set up a time.
There he is the bad lieutenant.
Hey.
I sold mine.
$300 for the five cases.
Oh I had a heater put in the Bloomfield wire room.
Guys were complaining.
Well good.
Yeah yeah that's good.
What's new with you?
Copacetic.
"We're with the Vipers."
Fun night.
Fuckin' A.
"Take it easy. Take it easy."
10-4.
You remember the look on the other guy's face?
Oh the fucking Grizzly Adams douchebag.
Yeah.
Dr. Cipolla's service.
I need to talk to the doctor.
ls this an emergency?
Of course.
Dr. Cipolla's out of town. Dr. Paglieri's on call.
Do you wanna be connected?
Nah.
Hey buddy boy how you doing?
Any of the girls working yet?
Last day already. God it goes fast.
Yeah.
St. Anthony's the week after next.
What's the matter baby?
Can you believe this? After all this she wants to go back on that ride.
She cried for three nights after.
The ride's closed baby.
Hey show everybody how you can walk.
Come on they wanna see.
Okay show 'em.
Show everybody how you can walk.
Show 'em.
Baby come here baby. Come on.
Have some candy. Look Cracker Jack.
Here you go.
Come on.
Whoo!
Whoa!
Where's our belly?
As you can tell by this outfit folks
I've picked out something with a little Norwegian flavor.
I'd like to play for you the "Johnny Oslo Shadish."
It's a typical Norwegian dance and who could do it better
than Bobby and Cissy?
Paulie? I don't wanna argue.
What are you watching?
The "Lawrence Welk" program channel 55.
