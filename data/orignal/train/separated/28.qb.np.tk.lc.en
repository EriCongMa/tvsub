security guard says it &apos;s the babysitter .

come on , it &apos;s making me nostalgic .
i got a police scanner at home to keep me company .
hey , k , what &apos;s up ?
hi , tony .
just wanted to see the professionals at work .
civilians aren &apos;t welcome .
what ?
come on , lou , she &apos;s a friendly .
she scratches our back , we scratch hers .
all right , i &apos;ve got the security guard in here .
the kids were fine ; she took them to their grandparents .
i said that she should wait for you guys here ,
that you &apos;d want to talk to her and mr. rucker .
mr. rucker was with her ?
no , it was just her .
i don &apos;t see the babysitter &apos;s car .
who picks her up and drops her off ?
mr. rucker .
husband ?
yeah .
he &apos;s like a stay @-@ at @-@ home dad , right ?
yeah ... yes , sir .
he just lost his job . he &apos;s out of work .
do you know where mr. rucker is now ?
at the movies .
we get a babysitter on thursday evenings
so my husband can take the night off .
otherwise he &apos;s home all day .
have you been in touch with jason yet ?
no , no . i @-@ i mean , i &apos;ve been trying his cell .
okay .
could you write down his number ?
you don &apos;t think they &apos;ll think jason ... ?
we have to prepare for everything .
hi , you &apos;ve reached jason rucker .
please leave a message .
mr. rucker , this is will gardner .
i &apos;m a partner at the law firm that represents your wife &apos;s company .
when you get this message , would you give me a call ?
it &apos;s extremely important .
struggle here ...
here .
blood spray . crenellated .
more struggle , more defensive spray .
handprint on the wall .
what &apos;s this ?
looks like the rubber nub from under a computer .
just a guess .
oh , boy .
is that the babysitter ?
yes .
lisa pruitt .
i @-@ i found ...
she was in my bathroom .
i &apos;m sorry to ask this , sonya ,
but our investigator on the scene is saying
there was marijuana .
did jason smoke pot ?
no .
in college .
why ?
sorry , you &apos;re ... ?
you get that a lot ?
less so .
sorry , i &apos;m a news junkie .
your husband ... i heard he &apos;s getting out .
oh , i don &apos;t know .
it changes day to day .
i hope he does .
thank you .
which floor ?
oh , you just pressed it .
oh , you work at stern , lockhart .
maybe you know what this is all about .
something about my wife &apos;s company ?
sorry . junior associate ... i &apos;m the last to know .
if there &apos;s anything , you just ...
jason .
what &apos;s wrong ?
what happened ?
mr. rucker , do you have a second ?
it &apos;s not a knife .
those aren &apos;t deep enough for knife wounds .
looks like a blunt instrument .
maybe it &apos;s something from the bedroom .
check the fireplace poker downstairs .
it &apos;s missing .
but i just saw her .
you just saw her ... the babysitter ...
when you picked her up ?
yes .
i picked her up at her dorm ,
and i drove her to ...
i &apos;m in trouble ?
i &apos;m the last one that saw her .
they &apos;ll suspect me ?
yes .
oh , my god .
then why ... ?
i need to go to the police , don &apos;t i ?
i just spoke to them .
i agreed to surrender you in the morning .
but these first few hours of an investigation
are always the most important .
anything can be misinterpreted .
won &apos;t my coming here be misinterpreted ?
unfortunately , it &apos;s a risk we &apos;re going to have to take .
this early in an investigation ,
it &apos;s all about leverage ,
and you have the right to remain silent ,
so our leverage is
how much access we allow the police .
they want more , we want less ,
so we &apos;re the gatekeepers to you .
yep .
we &apos;re going to have you take a polygraph , mr. rucker .
it &apos;s not about truth or innocence .
i &apos;m sorry , a lie detector test ?
yes , i need information
so i know how much to let you talk versus how much to keep you silent .
yeah ?
they &apos;re on their way to you now .
they &apos;re not going to wait till tomorrow .
how long ?
20 minutes , ten if they send someone from central .
you have 15 minutes .
i &apos;m going to start hooking you up .
here you go .
thank you .
in about five minutes
the police are going to burst through those doors .
i need you to be on for the next 48 hours .
that &apos;s how long they have to charge him with murder or release him .
it &apos;s now going to be the most crucial 48 hours of his life .
if they charge him , bail &apos;s a long shot
and he could spend a year in prison before he comes to trial .
even if he &apos;s found innocent ,
that &apos;s a year of his life gone ,
so these 48 hours are gonna be like a mini @-@ trial .
we &apos;re gonna get the cops to look somewhere else
and get him released , okay ?
i rode up in the elevator with him .
either he &apos;s the best actor in the world
or he had no idea this happened .
okay , good , it &apos;d be nice if he was innocent .
it &apos;s a better hand .
come on , i thought we had an agreement .
jason rucker .
yes ?
mr. rucker , you are under arrest for the murder of lisa pruitt .
you have the right to remain silent .
anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law .
easy , easy .
you have the right to an attorney .
if you can &apos;t afford an attorney , jason ! jason !
one will be appointed ...
sonya !
ma &apos;am , no , you need to step back .
okay , here we go ... 48 hours .
the panic alarm was triggered from inside ?
yeah ... yes , ma &apos;am .
so the alarm wasn &apos;t triggered from someone breaking in .
it was triggered from someone already in ?
yeah , that &apos;s why they &apos;re thinking the husband did it ...
because he could disarm the system .
and who else can disarm the system ?
who else ,
uh , besides mr. rucker ?
yes , mr. horner .
well , uh , housekeeper and lisa , the babysitter .
miss pruitt ?
yeah .
what ?
you said &quot; lisa . &quot;
yeah , lisa pruitt . why ?
what &apos;s the housekeeper &apos;s name ?
i don &apos;t know .
but you know lisa &apos;s .
i try to be observant .
hmm , selectively observant .
you can also disarm the alarm system .
it &apos;s not just the housekeeper and lisa the babysitter , is it ?
i don &apos;t think i want to answer any more of your questions .
you don &apos;t need to answer any more of her questions .
so ... did you find the murder weapon ?
the poker ?
yeah , it &apos;s right outside the door ,
right where the husband dropped it .
the husband ?
yeah .
really ? and how does that play , tony ?
he lets himself in ,
tries to rape her , she resists , he kills her .
steals the missing red purse ,
triggers the alarm on the way out ,
make it look like a burglary .
see , i &apos;m liking the security guard .
oh , you &apos;re such an unbiased observer .
guard sees the babysitter ,
wants her , lets himself in , disarms the code ,
tries to rape her , she resists ,
then steals her pretty red purse ,
triggers the alarm on the way out
to make it look like a burglary .
husband lost his job as a cartoonist two months ago .
now he &apos;s sitting at home playing mr. mom
while wife &apos;s out making an internet fortune .
that hubby needs to reassert his manhood .
hey , listen , i &apos;m all for dime store psychoanalysis
if it helps me close a case .
just keep an open mind for the security guard .
my mind is as open as a field of poppies .
you look , um ... content .
you know , sometimes the fog dissipates ,
the rain disappears , and everything makes sense .
uh @-@ huh . you &apos;ve made a decision ?
i have .
alicia around ?
uh , no .
peter .
glenn .
so , you know the offer you made ?
what offer would that be ?
freedom today if i don &apos;t fight the conviction ,
stay disbarred , can &apos;t run again .
yes , that offer . smart move would be to take it .
so i have to imagine you &apos;re going to tell me to go to hell .
you want the longer version ?
can &apos;t wait .
i wouldn &apos;t get too comfortable in that office of yours .
i &apos;m gonna testify .
would it help if i told you that that &apos;s a mistake ?
look , if i end up in a 12 by 12 cell
for the next nine years ,
i just want to know that i did everything i could .
will you call alicia for me ?
i liked her .
i wouldn &apos;t hurt her .
so , you were at the movies ?
yes .
legend of condor hero . it &apos;s a wuxia movie .
a ... ?
wuxia ?
wire fu .
chinese flying .
oh , like crouching tiger ?
sorry .
they play them every thursday night
at armour square , chinatown .
and you have the ticket stub ?
no , i threw it away .
you ... ?
okay , so we &apos;re gonna have to find someone who saw you there .
wuxia , wuxia .
cary , can i talk to you for a second ?
are you on something ?
no .
i like you , alicia .
i like you , too , cary .
i need you to pull it together now .
okay .
okay , here we go . pulling .
what i don &apos;t understand is why are we hearing about this now ?
i showed you his lie detector test .
a partial test you conducted .
by a top fbi polygraphist ,
and he was passing with flying colors .
then let me question him .
with conditions .
i could charge him right now .
then do it .
what &apos;s stopping you ?
you don &apos;t have enough .
i want two of my lawyers to stay with him at all times .
they have the freedom to consult him with the camera off .
and i want 15 @-@ minute breaks every hour .
no food ?
pizza .
in one hour .
he is a little creepy .
walks around like he &apos;s saving the neighborhood .
you know what ?
we had a break @-@ in right after he started six months ago .
really ? what did they take ?
that &apos;s the thing .
just some money from our bureau ,
some clothes from my closet and popsicles .
popsicles ?
yeah .
i think he did it ,
just so he could come and take a report , you know ?
same thing with three other houses in the neighborhood .
it &apos;s just creepy .
then what did you do ?
well , i dropped her at the house .
i made sure she had my cell number ,
then i went to the movies .
did you see the security guard anywhere near the house ?
the guard ? sure . he &apos;s always around .
you seen him around much when you dropped off lisa pruitt ?
i guess .
yes , thank you , mr. gardner .
we &apos;re following all leads .
really ?
yes .
because i know you have an unoccupied interrogation room .
so , very simply ,
you &apos;re in jail now because you dp &apos;d cases , is that right ?
it is .
could you explain ?
well , dp means declining to prosecute .
and what cases did you decline to prosecute ?
uh , investigations into allegedly corrupt real estate practices .
what was happening is
that speculators were buying depressed properties
on the land near where olympic stadiums were to be built .
why did you stop these investigations ?
they sound promising .
for a very simple reason-- lashkar @-@ etaiba ,
which is a jihadist extremist group
believed to be active in chicago ,
allegedly involved in last year &apos;s attacks in mumbai .
and the fact of the matter is ,
is i pulled these investigators from these other cases
because i believed that the pursuit of these extremists was more important .
in fact , there was an arrest in october ?
that &apos;s correct .
that would be david coleman headley ,
allegedly a key member of let .
so ...
why didn &apos;t you testify to all of this at your trial ?
i should have .
but there was a larger consideration .
a failing in my personal life was being used against me .
i wanted to protect my family against further hurt .
i knew that i couldn &apos;t testify about these false corruption charges
unless i was then willing to testify about ...
my life .
thank you , mr. florrick .
mr. landry , your witness .
actually , my witness , your honor .
um , your honor ? objection .
on what grounds ?
mr. childs , you &apos;re not the judge here .
apologies , your honor .
uh , mr. childs is instrumental in the matters
directly under consideration here , your honor .
those are the grounds .
but mr. florrick is such a great american hero ...
your honor .
... and has been instrumental in the defense of our great nation .
your honor !
surely he wouldn &apos;t mind a few softball questions .
my goodness ,
the sarcasm is as thick as butter here today .
i don &apos;t mind being questioned by mr. childs , your honor .
in fact , i welcome it .
well , then , let &apos;s take a short break for lunch ,
and pick up right where we left off .
she was selling drugs .
i bet it was a drug deal gone bad .
come on , you don &apos;t know that .
i knew her better than you did .
look , i think it was that guy from the neighborhood where she babysat .
she always said he was a nuisance .
excuse me , but do you guys have a minute ?
yeah .
sorry . i have to go to class .
all right . hey , i &apos;ll see you after comp , okay ?
so , are you a cop ?
nope . homicide .
would you mind , please ?
what you were saying about lisa pruitt &apos;s babysitting--
she ever mention anything to you about a guard ?
no . no . a secure ... ?
no .
it was the dad that she was working for .
um , what &apos;s his name ?
burkle , or , uh , rucker .
she said that he was getting too close .
making her uncomfortable .
they were working on something together , some project ,
and she said she was gonna quit .
so ,
um , do you want me to make a statement or something ?
... we &apos;ll call you , okay ?
all right .
yeah .
look , um , not right now ,
but maybe you and i could meet up later ,
and i could take it down then .
so , you threw away your ticket stub . is that it ?
yes .
okay .
and this chinese movie-- what was it about ?
legend of the condor heroes ?
it &apos;s about two sons learning martial arts in mongolia .
sounds exciting .
you know chinese ?
chinese ? no .
then how did you understand it ?
the subtitles .
that &apos;s odd .
we checked ,
and there were no subtitles on the print last night .
usually there are subtitles , but ...
not on that one .
let &apos;s take a break for a second .
yes .
let &apos;s do that , mr. gardner .
detective ?
the camera .
what &apos;s going on ?
it has nothing to do with this .
mr. rucker , you don &apos;t understand . the decisions you make right now
you &apos;ll regret for decades if you don &apos;t make them right .
yeah .
look , i just ...
you don &apos;t know what it &apos;s like to be out of work , to be stuck at home .
i do . so tell me .
i have a place to work , to do ...
i do graphic novels .
but ... but just on spec . i &apos;m not being paid .
and you do this work at an office ?
that &apos;s where you were ?
you weren &apos;t at the movies ?
it &apos;s just a studio to draw .
it &apos;s nothing . it &apos;s the size of a closet .
and lisa pruitt was working with you ?
our investigator is talking to a friend of pruitt &apos;s .
she did some writing for your graphic novel ?
yes .
were you sleeping with her ?
no .
so , what &apos;s in the studio ?
what &apos;s in there that the police might misunderstand ?
i don &apos;t know .
has she been there ?
has lisa been there ?
yes . once .
look , i didn &apos;t say anything
&apos;cause i knew how it would look .
so , where is this ?
where is this studio ?
what do you have ?
looks like your client had a little love nest .
just found out about it on the victim &apos;s computer .
you know the security guard had priors for selling dope ?
dope ?
yeah . and a hero complex .
that &apos;s fascinating . keep on that .
there are three unexplained burglaries in the last six months .
all on the same nights the security guard worked .
damn . i just sent alicia off to check it out .
she &apos;s got about ten minutes .
okay . calling .
alicia , where are you ?
i &apos;m , uh ... looking for the key .
didn &apos;t he say it was on a pipe ?
yes , and , not to put too much pressure on you ,
but the police are on their way .
on their way here ?
yes . they &apos;re about ten minutes behind you .
now , it &apos;s not a crime scene , so you &apos;re fine to inspect
and take anything you want .
anything i want ? what are we saying ?
i have the key .
look ...
look , i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re going to find in there ,
but until the police declare it a crime scene ,
you can preserve for our uses anything you find .
has jason said anything ?
no , but the police could misunderstand something they find .
and kalinda thinks the security guard is heating up .
here &apos;s something she wrote .
a short story .
okay , i think we could use that .
there &apos;s a blonde hair in a brush .
what do i do ?
is it a long hair ?
yes .
take it .
no hair in the drain .
thanks . good .
there &apos;s a bra on the towel rack .
one second .
they &apos;re here .
thanks .
you all right ?
i think so .
you were well within the law .
&quot; well &quot; ?
you were within the law .
i know it feels like we &apos;re playing a game sometimes ,
but we &apos;re not here to pursue the truth .
we &apos;re here to defend a client .
and if he &apos;s guilty ?
then , he &apos;s guilty .
truth is above our pay grade .
who &apos;s with jason now ?
cary .
take a few hours off .
get some lunch or something .
are you going to go back to help cary ?
yes .
go .
get this off your mind .
she telling her ?
yep .
that can &apos;t be a fun conversation .
why do you not look surprised ?
you knew he had a studio ?
no , but ...
every marriage runs on a few secrets , diane .
men need their caves .
did you know he was working with her on writing a graphic novel ?
no .
i knew something .
it &apos;s been hard for him since he &apos;s been out of work--
for me to be the one earning the money .
so , did you ever think that he and lisa ... ?
why do i suddenly feel as though i &apos;m under suspicion ?
sonya , the question is going to be asked .
if there &apos;s something that you want to tell me ,
now is a good time .
no .
well , then ...
is he innocent ?
of ?
hurting her ?
yes . yes , he &apos;s innocent of that .
but sleeping with her--
he &apos;s not innocent of sleeping with her ?
i don &apos;t know .
is there-- sonya , i @-@ i hate to do this ,
but jason isn &apos;t being up @-@ front with us--
is there anything that would lead the police
to believe that he is guilty ?
there might be .
let &apos;s start with the easier questions , shall we ?
how many times did you sleep with this prostitute ,
amber madison ?
objection , your honor .
sex is not relevant to my client &apos;s guilt .
mr. florrick was sentenced
for dp &apos;ing cases in trade for sexual favors ,
so sex is entirely relevant to his guilt , your honor .
the fact of the sex is relevant , your honor , but not the minutia .
then i will endeavor to discern the minutia .
you may continue , mr. childs , but , oh , so carefully .
how many times did you sleep with amber madison ?
well , just to be precise , mr. childs ,
by &quot; sleeping with , &quot; you mean &quot; having sex &quot; ?
yes . thank you .
and just to be even more precise ,
by &quot; having sex , &quot; i will also include oral @-@ genital contact .
18 times .
18 times .
and would you classify any of these as oral @-@ genital contact ?
objection .
minutia , mr. childs .
thank you , your honor .
now , were these assignations with amber madison ...
were they in hotel rooms ?
yes .
all 18 of them , you were in a hotel room ?
to the best of my memory .
well , let &apos;s see if we can refresh your memory .
did you ever sleep with amber madison
at your home while your wife was away ?
objection .
your honor , the defendant has made it very clear
he believed he paid for these various hotel sessions with amber madison .
we just want to be clear
that these were the only sessions .
overruled .
so , mr. florrick ,
did you ever sleep with amber madison at your home ,
in your bed , while your wife was away ?
no .
and you know you &apos;re under oath ?
cammy , let it be stated that i know i &apos;m under oath ,
and i know that mr. childs is trying to catch me in a perjury trap ,
and yes , my answer is still no .
thank you , mr. florrick .
no problem .
she set up a nanny cam in the living room
to see if her husband was sleeping with the babysitter .
well , would &apos;ve been helpful to know .
yes . more secrets than an o &apos;neill play here .
it &apos;s in a digital clock on the end table .
i &apos;m not sure i &apos;m going to be able to get in .
do you want me to tell the police ?
no . i don &apos;t know what &apos;s on it .
sonya says there &apos;s a key under the mat by the front door .
right . let me see what i can do .
oh . does she have a laptop case with her ?
yes . why ?
when you get a chance , check and see if one of the rubber nubs
on the bottom is missing .
any particular reason ?
the police think it was used to knock out the babysitter .
miss sharma ?
process server .
you &apos;ve just been subpoenaed .
which case ?
florrick &apos;s appeal .
have fun .
i &apos;m not testifying .
then you &apos;re going to jail .
look , i &apos;ve got nothing to offer .
you have everything to offer .
you know you do .
peter florrick lied on the witness stand .
tell the truth , he spends the next nine years in prison .
glenn .
what ?
don &apos;t do this .
come on , kalinda . what do you care ?
you &apos;re out for yourself .
you &apos;ve always been out for yourself .
and either way , you &apos;re going to tell the truth .
you don &apos;t know that .
i know that the sun is coming up tomorrow ,
and that you are going to tell the truth on the stand
and florrick is going back to prison .
end of story .
you okay ?
yeah .
what time is it ?
midnight .
how long have i been here ?
day and a half .
i was freaking out .
yes , i know .
did you tell will ?
what , that you were freaking out ?
no . why ?
it was a friend of mine from the peace corps .
i thought i had the day off .
cary , i didn &apos;t tell him .
why didn &apos;t you ?
with the contest , you know , why @-@ why didn &apos;t you tell him ?
i ...
there are so many people lined up against us ,
i just don &apos;t want one more .
i don &apos;t want you to lose .
i know .
i don &apos;t want you to lose , either .
i kind of like you .
i &apos;m surprised , but i kind of like you , too .
ah , i can &apos;t help it , you know . being competitive-- it &apos;s just me .
oh , no , no , no , no , no .
not the scorpion and the frog story , please .
the scorpion on the frog &apos;s back .
yeah , i hate that story , too .
why do people tell it so much ?
because it excuses people &apos;s behavior .
how &apos;s he doing ?
you don &apos;t want to know .
try me .
what ?
so , you were at the office all night
until you got a call from security about the silent alarm ?
yes . why ?
you didn &apos;t go home before that ?
no. why would i ?
our investigator checked the nanny cam .
it hadn &apos;t been turned on .
oh , well , i must have forgotten that day .
yes .
we thought only four people
could disarm the security alarm--
jason , your housekeeper ,
the babysitter and the security guard--
but we forgot , you could , too .
yes .
why ? what &apos;s wrong ?
we found a notice of a failure to deliver a package to your house .
our investigator checked with the company .
you signed for a delivery .
at 7 : 30 p.m. ,
when you said you were at work .
i @-@ i didn &apos;t do it .
okay , so what were you doing at home ?
i was jealous .
i thought jason was sleeping with her .
i came home to surprise them .
and ?
he wasn &apos;t there .
she was there ,
reading to the girls .
i left embarrassed , intent on never being jealous again .
and that was it ?
that was it .
can i check your laptop ?
why ?
please .
tired ?
tired doesn &apos;t even begin to describe it .
okay , so here &apos;s what we need to do .
build a chinese wall .
yep , and you can &apos;t tell me what she said .
complete separation .
you represent jason .
i represent her .
each has a strong motive , and in about 12 hours ,
one of them is going to be charged .
so , we can &apos;t talk to each other anymore .
understood .
good luck .
you , too .
one of us is going to come out the winner tonight .
i &apos;ve been subpoenaed .
to what ?
your husband &apos;s trial .
why would they subpoena you ?
i know certain things .
well , that doesn &apos;t sound good .
are you going to tell me ?
do you want to know ?
i don &apos;t know .
oh , god , i don &apos;t know anymore .
the truth seemed so simple--
lying , not lying .
do you want him out ?
i just want things to stop spinning .
you &apos;re right , i don &apos;t want to know .
stay away from court tomorrow .
alicia florrick .
oh , yes , thank you for getting back to me .
so , lisa pruitt would ...
i see .
right .
well , thank you .
what ?
that was this lawyer .
i found it near the belongings of the victim in rucker &apos;s studio .
lot of lawyers running around this one .
i don &apos;t even know who we &apos;re defending anymore .
it &apos;s gotten very confusing .
yeah .
the lawyer wouldn &apos;t tell me if lisa pruitt had been in to see her .
of course not . that would be too easy .
but she did tell me what kind of work they do .
matching pregnant women with families who want to adopt .
detective , i need you to stop interrogating my client and step out .
i was just asking a question .
you can finish later .
please .
what &apos;s wrong ?
you got her pregnant .
she was at your little studio ...
no . what ? no .
she went to a law firm for adoption .
tell me now because they &apos;re going to find this out
during an autopsy .
you got her pregnant .
no , i couldn &apos;t have .
she was at your studio .
yes , i know , but i didn &apos;t get her pregnant .
tell me the truth .
i couldn &apos;t have gotten her pregnant .
i had a vasectomy .
i was wondering when you were coming back for that statement .
yeah , i &apos;m sorry i &apos;m so late .
a couple more questions came up about lisa pruitt .
she ever mention anything to you about being pregnant ?
who said that ?
oh , her lawyer .
she was contacting a law firm
about putting a baby up for adoption .
yeah , she told me .
she say who the father is ?
who she babysits for-- rucker .
really ?
yeah .
that &apos;s why i think he did it .
killed her .
he wanted her to have an abortion , she said no .
did she tell you that ?
yeah .
he , uh , he didn &apos;t want to be pinned down .
you know , this is ... this is all very helpful .
you want me to say the same thing to the cops ?
yeah .
can you come with me now ?
yeah .
just @-@ just give me a minute .
sure .
what &apos;s wrong ?
nothing .
miss sharma ,
the defendant fired you from the state &apos;s attorney office , didn &apos;t he ?
yes , he did .
now , in your own words ,
could you explain why he did that ?
he said i was working two jobs .
and were you ?
yes .
so you were working for him , and you were working for ... ?
you .
and what kind of work were you doing for me ?
i was running down bimbo eruptions .
would you please explain that colloquialism ?
your honor , again , we object to this line of questioning .
your honor , this is our last witness .
we ask for some leniency .
granted .
overruled , mr. golden .
what were bimbo eruptions ?
you were worried that lawyers and judges were being co @-@ opted
by powerful forces who used prostitutes to blackmail .
and when you started this task force ,
you discovered that mr. florrick was involved with amber madison .
would you please explain
how she was used to co @-@ opt mr. florrick ?
a procurer assigned specific prostitutes
to flatter and pursue certain clients .
and the clients were referred to by number .
for example , one of the clients was referred to as client 12 .
and what did these ... these women do ?
these @-@ these prostitutes ?
they would discover the marital status
and sexual predilections of these clients .
to use the example of client 12,
um , he was found to be a judge ,
a married judge , with three daughters ,
and he was deemed to be interested in african @-@ american prostitutes ,
and the imagery of southern plantation life .
okay .
once mr. florrick was involved with amber madison ,
no money exchanged hands , isn &apos;t that correct ?
yes , that is correct .
and if a client tried to pay ,
a procurer would refund the client &apos;s money .
like when client 12 tried to pay
for an evening out with two african @-@ american women ,
that money was refunded .
miss sharma , you don &apos;t need to refer to a particular client .
just answer my question .
but i &apos;ve been asked to answer in my own words .
these are my own words .
right , your words could be a bit more on point .
now , did mr. florrick have sexual relations
with amber madison at his home ?
to answer that question , i need to talk about my job ,
and how important it was for me
to know the names of all the clients ,
including client 12 .
kalinda .
i &apos;m here under subpoena , mr. childs .
if i &apos;m asked to name the names of the clients , i must .
right ?
um , your honor ,
uh , again , we object to this , uh , sexual line of questioning .
it &apos;s @-@ it &apos;s irrelevant ,
just like the names of these clients is irrelevant .
we respectfully submit
that this is beneath the dignity of this court .
i would tend to agree , mr. golden .
surely , your honor , there is a way to elicit this testimony ,
possibly in chambers ?
not without these clients &apos; names
becoming part of , uh , public record .
isn &apos;t that right , miss sharma ?
yes , i &apos;m afraid so .
i &apos;ve given too much leeway to this sexual testimony ,
mr. state &apos;s attorney . now i must call it to a halt .
your honor ...
no , sir .
it is 4 : 00 p.m.
and i find myself unpersuaded by your arguments
of mr. florrick &apos;s guilt .
i believe this was nothing more than a sexual witch hunt .
but that &apos;s not for me to decide .
my job is merely to determine if there is enough for a new trial ,
and i believe , mr. florrick , there is .
i &apos;m sorry , mr. florrick .
i &apos;m sorry this has happened to you .
and i &apos;m sorry i don &apos;t have the power to do more than order a new trial .
but that is exactly what i &apos;m going to do .
you , mr. florrick , have been granted a retrial .
yes !
the kid from the dorm was right about the motive .
it was just his motive ,
not jason &apos;s .
she wouldn &apos;t get an abortion ?
they argued , and he killed her .
how did lisa &apos;s bra get in jason &apos;s studio ?
jason gave her the keys ,
and her and max would go there when he wasn &apos;t around .
at least that &apos;s what jason said .
they don &apos;t look so happy , do they ?
i don &apos;t understand marriage .
it &apos;s a mysterious institution .
you never wanted it ?
is that a proposal ?
yes .
i &apos;ve been watching you from afar .
this is weird .
maybe you should watch tv .
there &apos;s nothing on .
we could play 20 questions .
does he have a key ?
he &apos;ll knock .
so , it &apos;ll be electronic monitoring ?
he &apos;ll have to stay here in the apartment ?
yes .
and we will all have to adapt .
okay , maybe we should just get on with ...
here we go .
i love you both .
