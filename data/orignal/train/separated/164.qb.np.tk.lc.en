第一季 第十七集
here--your one and only source into the scandalous
lives of manhattan &apos;s elite. you &apos;re one of my oldest friends .
that &apos;s certainly not how it felt when you kissed me at eleanor &apos;s .
he proposed before we left , and i &apos;m going to say yes .
i &apos;m sure you &apos;ll make a beautiful bride .
last night was strange but very fun .
didn &apos;t we just say good @-@ bye ?
somehow , you screwing blair for sport is my fault !
all right , i know how long you and i have been best friends , okay ?
no , it &apos;s not okay. from now on , you stay away from me .
georgina. what are you doing here ? i told you i was coming .
dan of all people cannot know georgie .
how about , um , dinner tonight with sarah instead ? oh , sarah again .
what is she , your new girlfriend or something ?
she &apos;s new in town , and she does want to meet you .
i &apos;m sarah .
what do you want from me ?
i want things to go back to how they were before that night ,
before things got so screwed up. what &apos;s georgina got on you ?
what &apos;s so bad you can &apos;t even tell me ?
if you put the camera over there , she &apos;ll never know .
you can tell me anything . i killed someone .
trouble in paradise ?
and who am i ?
that &apos;s a secret i &apos;ll never tell .
you know you love me .
x.o.x.o. , gossip girl .
in our modern age , when you can call someone and can &apos;t find them ,
you can pretty much be sure they &apos;ll get the message .
hey , s . , it &apos;s georgie .
listen , i know it &apos;s early , but i thought i &apos;d ...
so this is my third call. where are you ?
it &apos;s me again .
i &apos;ve left you a couple messages , and you haven &apos;t called me back .
i think we should hang out today. friends hang out .
maybe you &apos;ve lost your cell phone .
can &apos;t wait to see you .
but if they don &apos;t call you back ,
it usually means they don &apos;t want to be found .
hey , do you think &quot; track me down &quot;
should come before or after &quot; everytime &quot; ?
is the &quot; rolling stone &quot; thing tonight ?
i guess i really am in one of the top ten forgotten bands of the &apos; 90s .
it &apos;s true . i forgot .
yeah , but a lot of people remember .
there &apos;s a reason that issue was one of the highest selling of the year .
and i &apos;m proud , dad . i really am .
you got your follow @-@ up article and a concert ,
surely followed by an overpriced cd sold at corporate coffeehouses
for gen xers without taste buds ... or taste. hey , it &apos; s gonna be cool .
i mean , they &apos;re even filming it for vh1. vh1 classics .
the &quot; classic &quot; is kind of important .
i &apos;m classic. uh @-@ oh , no retort .
signs of a sleepless night .
disinterest in making your father feel old and irrelevant ...
that can only mean one thing-- girl trouble .
yeah , serena and i ,
we had a fight last night-- this new
kind we keep having where she says something ,
and i know it &apos;s not the whole truth .
well , have you asked her what &apos;s really on her mind ?
only about 10,000 times , yeah. yeah , but did you really mean it ?
most times , when people don &apos;t offer the truth ,
it &apos;s because they &apos;re afraid of what someone might think .
and i don &apos;t know if you know this , but you can be a pretty judgmental guy .
so you &apos;re saying that i should learn to be someone else around her
so she can be herself around me ? i couldn &apos;t have said it better myself .
thank you , dad .
i &apos;m gonna go find her right now .
see you tonight ... both of you .
and here i thought i had your schedule memorized .
i switched shifts and just got off .
i &apos;m dan &apos;s dad &apos;s roadie for the day , so i gotta bail in , like , five .
um , although i don &apos;t mind the stalking ...
when are you gonna ask me on a real date ?
hold that thought. sorry .
hello ?
yeah. yeah , okay , i &apos;ll be right there .
look , i &apos;m sorry. i @-@ i gotta go. so i heard .
no , no , no. it &apos;s not what you think. it &apos;s just ...
what are you doing tonight ?
uh , me , lincoln hawk , a dirty van and a lot of cables ?
can i meet you at the concert ? can you be there at 7 : 30 ?
it &apos;s a date. finally .
text me the address .
the guests will be checked into their suites as soon as they arrive .
the walk @-@ through is at 2 : 00,
and the rehearsal dinner starts promptly at 7 : 00 p.m. the in reid salon .
oh , and don &apos;t forget .
you have your interview with &quot; rolling stone &quot; in one hour. the interview .
how could we forget ?
mm @-@ hmm. hey , uh , excuse me , mr . bass , ms . van der woodsen .
not for long , thank you very much .
morning , daniel. morning .
good morning. have either of you seen serena ? she &apos;s not upstairs .
uh , ticktock , ticktock , ticktock , ticktock , ticktock .
no. sorry , daniel .
okay .
and her bed hasn &apos;t been slept in .
well , i knew housekeeping was hiring ,
but i had no idea their standards were so low .
i hate that i have to ask you this , but have you seen serena ?
oh , i &apos;ve seen lots of serena .
are you drunk dialing again ?
no , serena didn &apos;t come home last night .
i thought she was with you .
hey .
maybe this is blair &apos;s idea of a perverse double date .
miss blair asks that you should wait there .
she &apos;s on her way now. she &apos;s not even here ?
well , this oughta be good .
you &apos;re not calling me back , and you &apos;re not picking up .
i thought you understood me ,
but maybe i should make myself a little more clear and come to you .
we can talk about it over coffee .
i brought it just the way you like it ...
dark but sweet .
oh , no .
hey , sarah !
dan ! hey !
oh , my gosh ! what a coincidence. yeah. w @-@ what are you doing here ?
oh , um , i actually have an old friend from portland staying here .
oh , okay .
what are you doing here ?
oh , i just--i came looking for serena , but she , uh ,
apparently didn &apos;t come home last night , so i @-@ i &apos;m just ...
i don &apos;t know . i &apos;m trying to figure out what to think .
she &apos;s been--well , let &apos;s just say she &apos;s not been herself lately .
so i @-@ i don &apos;t know . i don &apos;t know . i don &apos;t know what to do exactly .
why don &apos;t you try giving her a call again ?
and when she sees it &apos;s you calling ,
she &apos;ll immediately pick up and tell you all about it .
hey , i &apos;ve been lookin &apos; all over for ya .
hey , is--is this dan ?
who &apos;s this ? my name &apos;s drew .
i &apos;m the bartender at one oak .
some girl left this phone here last night .
it &apos;s been ringing off the hook all morning .
you were the first number on the speed dial , so-- some girl ?
what--what girl ?
tall , blonde. left here around 2 : 00 with 3 guys .
skipped out on her tab , which was pretty substan-- hey. what is it ?
spotted--lonely boy on the upper east side
learning the lesson that nothing stays missing for long .
it &apos;s nothing. nothing .
things always turn up , for better ...
well , is something actually wrong ,
or is this just some ploy to get us both here ?
i meant what i said on the phone . i need your help .
we need your help .
or for worse .
you okay ?
what &apos;s wrong with her ?
take her upstairs. get her upstairs .
dorota ! coffee , fast .
come on , serena. we have to get her in the shower .
no , i just want to sleep .
here. no. come on , come on. why won &apos;t you let me sleep ?
we have to keep her talking and awake. come on , come on .
dorota , will you please get her a fresh change of clothes and a bathrobe ?
let &apos;s go. let &apos;s go .
of course , miss blair .
so we have every hangover cure known to man , plus bagels .
they should help soak up the alcohol and whatever else she took .
thank you . i &apos;ll take it from here. come on .
come on. come on , serena. help me out .
b. , it &apos;s cold ! it &apos;s cold ! just like old times .
you know , why do i get the feeling you &apos;re actually enjoying this ?
call me sentimental .
ugh . i may not need those bagels after all. what &apos;s going on with her ?
she was here last night , scared .
she ...
she told me something totally crazy ,
but was too freaked out to find the words to explain it .
i went upstairs to find my mom &apos;s valium to calm her down ,
but when i got back , she was gone .
it took me all night to find her .
what exactly did she say to you ?
that &apos;s beside the point .
we &apos;re here to help serena , no matter what the problem is .
beauty bags bass
hey , could you maybe read that somewhere else ?
i don &apos;t like the &quot; post . &quot; is that why you subscribe ?
another thing i don &apos;t like--my son depressed .
i don &apos;t know if you &apos;ve talked to him recently ... we &apos;ve talked .
he and serena-- should i be worried ?
it &apos;s been a little bumpy lately , sure .
i think the most recent bump is our friend sarah .
serena &apos;s a little jealous , but sarah &apos;s cool ,
so as soon as serena gets to know her , everything will be fine .
i love that picture of you !
yeah , me , too .
tell me where you took this photograph ,
what undoubtedly could be called the band &apos;s most well @-@ known image ?
uh , well , i wouldn &apos;t go that far .
well , i would. it &apos;s positively iconic .
were you and rufus humphrey already involved when you took it ? excuse me ?
rufus humphrey , lead singer of lincoln hawk .
was this before or after-- oh , well ,
i simply don &apos;t feel comfortable discussing anything other than my work .
i was talking about your work .
why &apos;d you give up photography ?
was it too hard to continue shooting after you had broken his heart ?
um , just--just a moment , please .
oh. you know , i see i &apos;m interrupting , so i &apos;ll ...
no , i have to say i have never been happier to see you , dan .
well , i &apos;ve been waiting downstairs for serena .
i @-@ i figured she has to come home ... sometime soon .
so have you heard from her ? have you tried calling ?
pretty sure she lost her phone .
charles said he was going over to blair &apos;s to pick
her up right after you left earlier. maybe try there .
ah , yes . &quot; charles . &quot; charles. of course. thank you so much .
i really appreciate your coming all the way to the palace
to conduct this interview ,
but i &apos;m simply gonna have to ask you to leave
because i have a wedding to attend--my own .
do you think you were able to take such incredible photos of
rufus humphrey because of how much you were in love with him ?
well , i wasn &apos;t in-- in love with him ...
um ... that much .
thank you for your time .
dorota , can you bring the towels upstairs ?
what &apos;s taking so long ?
huh. guess i missed a chapter .
or ... four. don &apos;t , uh ...
don &apos;t all of you hate each other ?
yes. absolutely .
no .
that &apos;s fascinating and ripe for a psychiatrist &apos;s case study somewhere ,
but , um , i am looking for serena .
she &apos;s not here .
i think she is .
no , she just left. you must &apos;ve crossed paths .
i @-@ i @-@ i don &apos;t believe you .
fine .
i @-@ i didn &apos;t want to have to tell you this , but ...
she doesn &apos;t want to see you .
come on. really ?
yes .
really .
serena ! she &apos;s telling the truth .
are you really gonna stop me from seeing my girlfriend ?
what are you doing ?
s. ?
it &apos;s okay .
what &apos;s happening ?
dan ... something is going on , and i just want to be let in on what it is .
it &apos;s hard to explain .
why don &apos;t i make it easy for you ?
i know you &apos;re keeping something from me ,
and i &apos;m sick of being the only one you don &apos;t talk to about it .
i &apos;m not talking to anyone .
then what are they doing here ,
while--while i get a call from a bartender who says
you left a bar at 2 : 00 in morning with a bunch of guys ?
what guys , serena ?
who--who were they ?
i don &apos;t know .
did something happen last night ?
please don &apos;t .
is that--is that what you &apos;re so afraid to tell me , that you cheated on me ?
did you cheat on me last night ?
all i need is a yes or a no. did you sleep with someone else ?
yes .
yeah .
i &apos;m done .
i &apos;m done .
hey ! did you find serena ?
yeah , but i @-@ i , uh , i kinda wish i hadn &apos;t .
that doesn &apos;t sound so good .
i &apos;m just in the park .
wanna meet me , maybe talk about it ?
i &apos;m a pretty good listener .
dan ?
yeah. yeah , i &apos;d , uh , i &apos;d like that .
well , i wanted cymbidiums , not hyacinth .
and why did we choose fish ? it &apos;s unseasonably warm .
you know , i knew we should &apos;ve gone with the limoges instead of the lenox .
what &apos;s the matter ? you were fine this morning .
now you &apos;re finding fault with everything .
nothing. nothing at all . i &apos;m just ...
i &apos;ve had three perfect weddings ,
and i want this one to be more perfect than perfect , that &apos;s all .
oh , finally .
so why are you still at blair &apos;s ?
you &apos;re supposed to be here .
ms. van der woodsen , it is dorota , ms .
waldorf &apos;s-- i know who you are , dorota , but this is not a very good time .
oh , the wedding . i know. miss serena is here .
oh , yes , i know . i &apos;ve heard several times today .
i know it &apos;s not my place , but ...
miss serena is ...
like the old days .
what are you trying to say ?
i think you should have worry about your daughter ,
worry like before she went away .
well , um ... thank you , dorota . i &apos;ll take care of it .
i am so sorry , but i &apos;m gonna have to go .
where do you have to go ?
to do something i &apos;ve done too many times before .
can i help you ? no. thank you . i &apos;ll have to do it alone. mwah .
i can &apos;t believe i just did that .
then why did you ? i mean , did you cheat on dan ?
no . i remember last night . i didn &apos;t do anything .
then why would you say that to him ?
because i would rather dan think i
cheated on him than know what i really did .
what you really did ?
dan puts me on a pedestal .
if he knew the truth , he would never look at me again .
you &apos;re starting to scare even me. what did you do ?
come on. you can tell us .
we &apos;ve seen you with vomit in your hair ,
making out with investment bankers in the men &apos;s room at p.j. clarke &apos;s .
you don &apos;t have to hide anything from us. she &apos;s right , serena .
i mean , none of us are saints .
yeah , i had sex with him in the back of a limo. several times .
i had sex with you at a wedding while i was her date .
once .
i &apos;m chuck bass .
you can tell us anything. we don &apos;t judge .
we &apos;re the non @-@ judging breakfast club .
we &apos;re your best friends .
anything you do is something we did , too .
if i tell you , it can never leave this room .
you all know gorgina sparks. some of us better than others .
it &apos;s not like you didn &apos;t lose your virginity to her in seventh grade .
sixth , actually , and i &apos;ve been avoiding her ever since .
the bitch is a psycho. what about her ?
well , something happened the night of the shepherd wedding .
i think we &apos;re all aware of what happened that night .
no , something else , something i &apos;ve tried to escape ,
but georgina won &apos;t let me .
and now she &apos;s blackmailing me .
blackmailing you ? with what exactly ?
it started when blair thought you and i had too much to drink .
she told us to go outside , get some air , sober up .
if the happy couple didn &apos;t want to put up the cash for the premium bar ,
they should &apos;ve made their wedding b.y.o.b.
instead , we went into the empty bar , i opened the bottle of champagne ,
we can skip that part , okay ?
go ahead . i &apos;ll fill her in later .
i left in a hurry .
i felt so terrible , so guilty for what i had just done .
i just--i had to get out of there .
eastview hotel , please .
georgina and i had plans to meet up after , so i headed straight to her .
little did i know she had a surprise waiting for me .
she &apos;s gonna lose her mind .
a genuine serena van der woodsen sex tape ...
how are we gonna do this , exactly ?
well , if you put the camera over there , she &apos;ll never know .
are you sure she &apos;s gonna be down for this ?
it &apos;s serena. she goes down for anything .
hey , baby. how are the new mr. and mrs . shepherd ?
i didn &apos;t know it at the time , but she was taping me .
lucky for me ,
i was--i was too stuck on what had
just happened to be much fun for anyone .
i can &apos;t believe i just did that . blair &apos;s my best friend .
what--what sort of person does that to her best friend ?
all right , this is a therapy session , g .
you promised a party .
so break out the favors .
thank you .
oh . i don &apos;t-- i don &apos;t feel so good .
she always gets frisky after she hurls .
no , pete .
i &apos;m not in the mood , okay ? come on .
i &apos;m hot , okay ?
i &apos;m--i &apos;m too hot. oh , you are too hot .
no , it &apos;s--it &apos;s hot. why is it so hot in here ?
what is it ?
i can &apos;t .
yes. yes , you can .
i &apos;m scared .
we &apos;re right here .
no. you know , i can &apos;t . i can &apos;t . i can &apos;t do this , pete. okay ?
i can &apos;t. um ...
yeah , how about , um ...
how about we do a couple lines first , okay ?
whatever , baby .
here. go ahead. okay .
pete ?
pete , are you okay ?
pete , what &apos;s happening ? are you okay ? georgie .
georgie ! georgina !
what ? why are you screaming ?
what are you doing ? i &apos;m calling 9 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 .
you--you can &apos;t !
there &apos;s drugs everywhere. we could get in so much trouble .
we can get arrested. we have to go. no ! we can &apos;t leave him !
we have to. get everything out that has you on it. go. oh , my god .
where &apos;s his phone ? where &apos;s his phone ?
what are you doing ? i &apos;m calling .
hello . 9 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 emergency. hi , uh , we have an emergency .
uh , can you send someone right away to the eastview hotel ?
room , uh , 1411 , please. there &apos;s a guy. he &apos;s having seizures .
i don &apos;t know what &apos;s wrong. get off the phone ! we have to go !
ma &apos;am , i &apos;m gonna need your name and , uh ...
hello ? hello , ma &apos;am ? are you there ?
so georgina told me we had to split up .
then she said that people might be looking for us .
but i @-@ i couldn &apos;t go . i just couldn &apos;t .
so i @-@ i waited near the hotel , across the street .
all i wanted was to see the paramedics helping pete .
but that &apos;s not what i saw .
i didn &apos;t know what to do .
i @-@ i just knew i had to leave right away .
i @-@ i took a train heading north ,
and i got a room and convinced my mom
that boarding school was a good idea , and ...
never said good @-@ bye .
it makes sense now .
but what does she even want from you ?
well , when she came back ,
i @-@ i told her that i moved on from the lifestyle that she was still in ,
but she didn &apos;t like that .
so somehow ,
she became friends with dan and--and
vanessa and--and called herself &quot; sarah . &quot;
why don &apos;t you just tell dan about her ?
because she has that tape of me , and she &apos;ll use it .
it &apos;s practically a snuff film .
we need to find her. no. please .
promise me , please .
promise me you won &apos;t do anything .
because if you do , then she &apos;ll show dan ...
if he even ever speaks to me again .
watch out , s .
just because you finally tell the truth
doesn &apos;t mean there won &apos;t be consequences .
god. what have i done ?
thanks for coming with me , b .
i &apos;m really not feeling up to being social. of course .
oh. excuse me .
you were supposed to be home hours ago. come with me .
i @-@ i &apos;m--i &apos;m sorry , mom. and you look beautiful .
i hope you don &apos;t mind . i asked blair to come tonight .
what happened to you last night ? why didn &apos;t you come home ?
why was dan looking for you all morning ?
and why did i get a call informing me that you were on drugs ?
i wasn &apos;t on drugs .
don &apos;t lie to me .
i saw that little home movie that you and your friends made .
you--you watched that ? well , only part of it .
i stopped when that guy had his tongue down your throat .
but i can pretty much guess how it ends .
no , it--it--it was just a joke. we were kidding .
it &apos;s not what it looked like. you know what ? you are out of control .
i always knew you had a wild side .
but how can you look at yourself ?
what have you become ?
i thought we were past all of this , serena .
i thought you were doing so well .
i have nothing left but to send you to reformatory school .
what do you think about that ?
what &apos;s wrong ? what happened ?
hey , guys. sorry to interrupt. tuned to f @-@ sharp minor .
and , lisa , sheckman told me to tell you you &apos;re almost up .
okay. thanks. thanks , vanessa .
hey. this is incredible , dad .
i hope you &apos;re sufficiently nervous , &apos; cause there &apos;s , like ,
a hundred people out there ,
which is 80 more than the last time you played , i think ?
lisa , this is my sarcastic son dan and his friend sarah. hey .
nice to meet ya .
pleasure .
hi. hi i &apos;ll see y &apos;all later. okay .
yeah. ah , no serena ?
i &apos;ll take good care of him , mr . humphrey. promise .
jenny &apos;s already called me about 15 times from mom &apos;s
to make sure that i call her during &quot; something like that &quot;
so she can hear you mess up the bridge. so break a leg .
i &apos;ll be in the front row. okay. okay .
hey , georgina !
georgina .
uh , i think she thinks she knows you .
i &apos;ve never seen her before in my life .
um , let &apos;s go get a drink .
don &apos;t send her away .
blair , it &apos;s--it &apos;s , uh , not polite to interrupt . i don &apos;t care who hears .
just don &apos;t send her away. excuse me .
thank you , blair ,
but it &apos;s not exactly your business what i do with my daughter .
if anything ,
you &apos;re one of the reasons i &apos;m having to take such strong actions .
i say this with all due respect , lily ,
but you have no idea what your daughter &apos;s been going through .
she &apos;s in a lot of pain ,
and i don &apos;t think the pain &apos;s gonna go away if she goes away .
i don &apos;t understand what you &apos;re trying to tell me .
serena has a secret , and she &apos;s been holding on to it for a long ,
long time .
and now it &apos;s finally catching up with her .
i @-@ i &apos;m out of my league here .
i can &apos;t do any more than i &apos;ve done , and it &apos;s not enough .
she needs you . i saw the video .
she doesn &apos;t need me. she needs boundaries .
what you saw isn &apos;t the whole story .
hey , v. , it &apos;s me .
you &apos;re not calling to cancel , are you ?
because waiting 20 minutes before the
concert maybe isn &apos;t the best way to let a girl down .
no ,
i &apos;m calling to let you know i may be ten minutes late because--drumroll ,
please-- i &apos;m actually gonna take the subway to the show .
subway , huh ? nate archibald , man of the people .
oh. well , thank you .
uh , and your name &apos;s on the list , but if you don &apos;t see me ,
just look for dan and our friend sarah .
they &apos;ll know where i am. wait , sarah &apos;s there ? with dan ?
as strange as it may seem , dan is here .
it is his dad &apos;s gig. no , no , no . i &apos;m not talking about dan .
i &apos;m talking about sarah .
okay , now you &apos;re totally weirding me out .
sarah is not her real name. it &apos;s georgina .
serena just told us this really messed up story about her .
just do not trust anything she says , please .
wh @-@ what are you talking about ?
listen , i &apos;ll tell you what i can when i get there , okay ?
okay .
okay . i &apos;ll see you soon .
excuse me .
here &apos;s the address you asked for .
thank you , charles. um , excuse us .
hello ? hey , i only have a second .
i &apos;m on my way to queens. ugh. gross. why ?
to meet vanessa at a concert. it got grosser .
we &apos;ve been hanging out .
not that i owe you any explanation ,
but i do feel like i should tell you apparently ,
georgina &apos;s with her and dan. she--she &apos;s there ?
yeah .
and you know serena doesn &apos;t want us to do anything ,
but i just thought you might want to know .
where are you right now ?
uh , 74th and lex .
don &apos;t move. pick you up in ten .
i have to go handle this thing with serena .
now ? yes , now .
it &apos;s our rehearsal dinner , and you &apos;re the bride .
i know , but i &apos;m also a mother , and ...
that &apos;s more important .
so your problems are my problems .
let me come and help .
i can &apos;t. i , uh ... i wish i could explain .
there seems to be a lot lately that you can &apos;t explain .
i &apos;m sorry. but this is between me and my daughter .
what &apos;s gotten into you ?
what if i told you i knew where georgina sparks was right now ?
i &apos;d say , let &apos;s get the bitch .
spotted--blair and chuck reunited to defend serena &apos;s honor .
with friends like thes who needs armies ?
so where are we ?
it &apos;s the fairman &apos;s house .
this is where the boy who died grew up , and his parents are expecting you .
mom , i can &apos;t go in there .
sweetie ...
if i &apos;ve learned anything in life ,
it is that sometimes things get in your path ,
and you have a choice--
you can either smash right into them , or you can adjust and move around ,
but you have to do one or the other in order to move forward .
how can i do this ?
i &apos;m gonna be right by your side .
ladies and gentlemen , how about a round of applause for lisa loeb ?
hey , everyone. how you doing ?
i &apos;m lisa loeb , and i &apos;m your host for tonight ,
and i am so happy you &apos;re all here .
thanks so much for coming .
we &apos;ve got a lot of great acts lined up. hey , v.
i didn &apos;t realize you &apos;d be able to hang during the concert .
do you have something you want to say to me ? not that i know of .
you sure about that ... georgina ?
my friend says serena told him some story about you ,
and he &apos;s on his way to fill me in , unless you want to do that first ?
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
i &apos;m not a big fan of liars , and neither is dan .
i &apos;m giving you a chance to explain yourself here .
where &apos;s sarah going ?
i don &apos;t know who she is .
nate just called me and said her name is georgina .
that &apos;s what that girl-- that &apos;s what that girl back there called her .
why would she lie about her name ? i think there &apos;s some other stuff , too .
vanessa , rufus can &apos;t find the set list .
do you know where it is ? i taped it into the top of his gibson case .
uh , i &apos;ll get it .
this will just take two minutes .
just don &apos;t go anywhere. stay right here .
i &apos;ll be right back .
you okay ?
no .
no , i feel terrible , mom .
oh , you heard what they said .
look , peter was an addict for ten years .
his own parents couldn &apos;t get him to stop using .
there &apos;s no way that a 16 @-@ year @-@ old girl could have .
they don &apos;t hold you responsible .
you don &apos;t need to blame yourself .
but i am responsible , mom .
i &apos;m the one that gave him the line that killed him .
look , serena , those were his drugs , okay ?
if you hadn &apos;t given them to him , he would have taken them himself .
then why do i still feel like this ?
because contrary to what i might have said earlier ,
you are a good person who , since that night ,
has been living your life with care and
compassion and respect for yourself and for others .
i &apos;m sorry i doubted you .
thank you .
there &apos;s something else i have to do .
will you help me ?
absolutely .
take me to see dan .
okay , so your name is really georgina .
well , i don &apos;t understand why you felt like you had to lie to us .
because ...
my boyfriend-- well , my ex @-@ boyfriend-- when we broke up ,
he wasn &apos;t too happy about it , and things got out of control .
okay , well , what happened ?
i came home one day , and ...
my car was broken into , and then a week later , my room was trashed ,
and i got really scared .
i changed all my numbers , i moved in with a friend ,
and yet he still tracked me down .
it was my mom &apos;s idea to change my name and move out of town .
i hate being away from my family , but ...
it &apos;s better than getting hurt , right ?
yeah , right .
i &apos;m sorry i didn &apos;t tell you .
i just--i wasn &apos;t supposed to tell anybody .
no , no , no. no. no. i @-@ i get that . i get it .
and i also didn &apos;t want you to think less of me ,
because i haven &apos;t wanted to admit it , but , um ...
from the moment that i met you , i &apos;ve been falling for you .
oh , my god . i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m sorry . i don &apos;t-- i don &apos;t know what i &apos;m saying .
you know , um , you know , it &apos;s really loud here .
well , do you wanna go somewhere else , someplace quiet we can talk ?
but your dad &apos;s about to go on .
he &apos;ll understand .
it &apos;s not like we won &apos;t be watching
this on youtube for the next five years .
hmm.some date we &apos;ve got here .
you even brought your friends , the ones i can &apos;t stand .
where &apos;s georgina ? what are you gonna do ?
you heard what serena said. yeah , like we care .
georgina left. left for where ?
i don &apos;t know. she just took off .
if i could only find dan-- he &apos;s around here somewhere .
