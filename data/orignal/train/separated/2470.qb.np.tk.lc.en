what the hell did you do ?
i can &apos;t protect mystic falls on my own ,
so i made some friends who could help .
who are these friends ?
alaric &apos;s babies are the future of the coven .
they &apos;re inside of you .
oh , my god ...
this is josie ,
in honor of their mother .
this is elizabeth ,
in honor of your mother .
meet rayna cruz .
once you &apos;ve been marked by her sword ,
she never stops hunting you .
you don &apos;t stand a chance against her , none of us do !
we &apos;ll keep moving , just like we did before .
no !
stefan ...
i &apos;ll see you , brother .
i have to keep moving , if i want to stay ahead of her .
why did you hand over that sword , damon ?
i will fix this .
i promise you .
i &apos;m gonna hold you to that .
wish i could be there .
i just wish it didn &apos;t always have to be you .
i love you .
all right , girls .
you know what this is ?
it &apos;s a bar .
and this is the last time you &apos;re gonna be in one of these
until you are 21 .
sorry , we &apos;re closed and ...
i don &apos;t think so .
we &apos;re not staying .
we just got here , and ...
then i realized i didn &apos;t actually know
where the person i &apos;m looking for lived .
klaus mikaelson ?
honey , hate to say this , but you &apos;ve wasted a trip .
look ... i know that he comes here .
okay ? my name &apos;s caroline forbes .
he &apos;ll know me .
i don &apos;t care who you are .
klaus mikaelson is gone .
gone ?
gone where ?
i mean nobody &apos;s seen or heard from that man in three years .
south georgia , i think .
i just ditched my car and passed grantville off the i @-@ 85 .
okay . you &apos;re about to come upon highway 27 . take it north .
eventually , you &apos;ll connect with the i @-@ 20
and want to take that west .
and where is this leading me , exactly ?
a safe house that &apos;s been imbued with a magical disruption spell .
even the strongest magic can &apos;t penetrate its walls ,
which means rayna cruz &apos;s sword cannot track you there .
did you find 27 yet ?
no , i just pulled over at a quik @-@ stop
in the middle of nowhere .
tell me you &apos;re joking .
my cell phone &apos;s almost dead .
i need a charger .
stefan , that &apos;s a mistake . get back in your car .
stefan , you can &apos;t stop moving , ever .
stefan ?
are you there ?
hello ?
hello ?
i need to buy a charger for my phone .
okay , we &apos;ve got the brick charger ...
the adapter for your car ...
this one &apos;s solar power-- pretty neat .
that &apos;s fine . how much ?
that &apos;ll be $ 22.50 .
valerie said she just lost cell reception with stefan .
as if ruining his life wasn &apos;t enough for me to worry about ,
now we get to wonder when you and valerie exchanged numbers .
you told stefan you would find a way
to get him off the hook with rayna
and i told caroline i &apos;d make sure you didn &apos;t screw it up .
so we both have a lot riding on this .
good .
you made it .
where the hell are we ?
this is the armory ,
home to a society of supernatural artifact collectors .
we keep them under lock and key
so they don &apos;t fall into the wrong hands .
the armory ...
never heard of it .
you ?
no .
yeah , that &apos;s kind of the point .
they &apos;ve taken great care
to keep themselves out of history as we know it .
and for three easy payments of $ 19.99,
we , too , can be members .
how about we just cut to the part
where they can save my brother ?
where &apos;s the cavalry , man ?
they &apos;re out on their own supernatural treasure hunt .
but , lucky you , they &apos;ve recruited me to nab rayna cruz .
ever since that annoying phoenix stone turned up in mystic falls ,
she &apos;s been the top priority .
they actually consider her one of the ...
supernatural wonders of the world .
and why do you care what they want ?
they have something i want .
good morning .
when the armory kidnapped me four months ago ,
it wasn &apos;t to torture me .
a woman named alex made me an offer .
who the hell are you ?
someone who needs your help .
and in return can provide you with information you desperately want .
if it &apos;s all the same ,
i &apos;d rather just be cut loose and be on my way .
be my guest .
just ... figured you &apos;d want to know who your family was ,
orphan and all .
how do you know about my family ?
because as obnoxious as it sounds ,
we like to think we know everything .
needless to say , i &apos;ve been working for the armory ever since .
look , all that we need to do is get stefan here ,
and rayna will have no choice but to follow .
a rat to the cheese . we spring the trap ,
and the armory keeps her under lock and key forever after .
everyone gets on with their lives .
what do you say ?
i &apos;ll have to discuss this with my counsel .
okay .
we &apos;re in .
mmm , must be time for another checkup .
actually , there &apos;s something i need to talk to you about .
what &apos;s going on ?
i &apos;m moving to dallas .
i &apos;m leaving today .
what ?
no , ric , you still need a house
and a nanny
and the right school district .
i don &apos;t care .
after i saw their little faces yesterday , everything changed .
is this about that psycho huntress ?
because you can rest assured
she is very far away from here ,
pursuing my equally far away from here boyfriend .
no . it is not about her .
okay ?
it &apos;s about jo .
and the promise i made to her
to leave town after we got married .
and we know how that turned out , okay ?
so i &apos;m not making that mistake twice .
and certainly not with my kids .
do you know how hard it is to travel with one newborn ,
let alone two ?
two car seats ,
two feeding schedules ,
crying in surround sound ,
not to mention the actual driving part .
i know . and stopping every 90 minutes . i get it .
which is why i &apos;ve hired a nurse to come with me .
a nurse ? who ?
frankie with the heart murmur ?
or jarica , the perpetual boyfriend texter ?
jarica .
come on .
do you have a better idea ?
me .
i &apos;m the better idea .
uh , but you just ... got through major surgery .
you just had a c @-@ section .
and i &apos;m all healed up .
that is the one and only perk of a vampire pregnancy .
i can either sit here , alone ,
freaking out that my boyfriend is somewhere
in this country trying to outrun a huntress
who will stop at nothing to kill him ,
or i can be useful .
it &apos;s up to you .
welcome to new orleans ,
old friend .
klaus .
as i live and breathe .
stefan salvatore
in the crescent city .
this ought to be very good
or entertainingly bad .
i &apos;m just in town for a little r &amp; r.
hate to disappoint .
so ...
how are elijah and , uh ,
whoever else you &apos;ve brought back from the dead ?
oh , you know the mikaelsons .
never a dull moment .
so , of all the gin joints , you pick ours--
four walls invulnerable to the magic of those pesky locator spells .
bit of a coincidence , isn &apos;t it ?
damon &apos;s looking for me ,
and i don &apos;t want to be found .
i figure you , of all people , can relate to family drama .
sylvia ,
this is an old friend . please keep his cup brimming .
cute old friend .
where have you been hiding him ?
quaint little place called mystic falls .
home of the mining fires that prompted a town @-@ wide evacuation .
it was very noble of you
to stand up for the human faction as you did ,
in such uncharacteristically sweeping , dramatic fashion .
i did have some help .
how is caroline ?
sylvia , i think we &apos;re gonna need another round .
what do you mean you don &apos;t know where rayna is ?
she &apos;s wherever stefan is .
no one knows where he is either .
he &apos;s not taking anyone &apos;s calls ,
and i can &apos;t triangulate his cell phone without at least knowing ...
what ? sorry , i &apos;m in a literal bell jar of baby noises .
i think they need to eat . are you hungry ?
no . yes , uh , we should stop .
caroline .
hello ?
i &apos;m here .
what &apos;s the plan ?
if i can narrow the search , we have a chance ,
but until i know the general vicinity of either of them ,
i have nothing to track .
i may be able to help you with that .
let me guess .
valerie &apos;s here to save the day .
let me call you back .
this is the highway system
between grantville and new orleans .
stefan &apos;s on his way there now ,
and rayna is no doubt breathing down his neck .
tell me you at least appreciate the irony .
i need your help because there &apos;s no sheriff &apos;s department left .
the reason there &apos;s no sheriff &apos;s department
is because you killed all the sheriffs .
then , yes , i do appreciate the irony .
just as i hope you appreciate
that i helped caroline deliver her babies
and that i am here because i am desperate to keep stefan alive .
i suppose if she stole a car or something ,
i could get a bead on her .
thank you .
i thought you hated rubbish food .
i do .
maybe it &apos;ll kill me .
beau , lily , oscar , malcolm--
our family couldn &apos;t survive in this new world .
and now , once again , the two of us have to worry
about a psychotic huntress ,
who will kill any vampire in her sight .
maybe this will be a quick sodium @-@ laden means to my end .
is this really who i &apos;m stuck traveling cross @-@ country with ?
we are running for our lives .
what could i possibly have to be happy about ?
us , mary lou .
starting over . together .
away from all this .
new horizons , new everything .
here .
am i supposed to know what that is ?
it &apos;s a ring , made from candy .
it &apos;s not even a diamond .
but what it is , is good enough .
we &apos;re all we have left .
let &apos;s see what else is out there together .
i suppose there &apos;s no one
i &apos;d rather explore this dreadful world with .
poor thing .
so desperate to embrace the modern world ,
but so unable to grasp the concept of cell phone tracking .
bag &apos; em up and let &apos;s go home .
where &apos;s stefan ?
safe . though i suppose that could mean
anywhere outside of your vicinity .
you know he has a girlfriend , right ?
blonde , sweet , cute as a button .
you &apos;re not actually her .
i &apos;m hanging up now .
you don &apos;t want to do that .
i have a way to take down rayna ,
but it requires him to come to me .
well , that might take a while .
he &apos;s in new orleans .
doubtful .
we only go to new orleans for crappy booze and klaus blood .
there &apos;s a bar there .
the st. james infirmary .
it &apos;s considered a safe house for supernatural travelers .
oscar came upon it when he was looking for the phoenix stone .
fine . just tell him to pack it up , huff it back to virginia
to a pile of bricks called the armory .
did you just say the armory ?
yes , i did .
as a matter of fact , i &apos;ve said that word more times today
than i have in my entire life .
get out of there , damon .
now .
why ?
the armory is a black hole of lies .
they once tricked us into using beau as bait
in exactly the same fashion they &apos;ll use stefan .
and they were more than happy to let rayna bury her sword in
his heart as long as they could put her in one of their cages .
i promise you , they will do the same to stefan .
well , i don &apos;t have another option at the moment , valerie .
yeah , well , whose fault is that ?
look , the best way you can help stefan
is to keep your mouth shut and stop making things worse .
so this faceless so @-@ called armory
claims to know where you come from ?
i find rayna cruz , they fill in the blanks .
and if you have to lie or hurt your friends
or screw anyone over in the process ,
so be it , right ?
i was sent to a workhouse at the age of four ,
with a concept of family so limited
that i actually convinced myself
that an italian line cook was my father .
by 14 , i was out in the streets .
by 27 , i was dead .
that is it , that is the sum total of my life as a human .
i know how to comfort myself , live off scraps ,
and catch disease .
the rest-- you know , love , relationships , family--
these are things i know nothing about .
this is what the armory can provide me .
so will i do whatever it takes for answers ?
in a heartbeat .
flag on the play .
like an idiot , stefan didn &apos;t renew the minutes on his cell phone .
we &apos;ll call you when we connect .
come on , bon . i want to beat traffic .
you know where he is .
yeah , i do , enzo .
i also know that you allowed me to believe elena was dead
so i &apos;d help you kill rayna ,
who &apos;s already escaped your custody once .
then you tricked me into saving your ass ,
which resulted in rayna getting this stupid sword ,
and now i have stefan &apos;s 1863 siphon crush
telling me that you all are shady people .
so bon @-@ bon here and i are gonna go cook up a plan b.
but thanks anyway ...
what are you doing ?
lockwood ?
found him where you left him , in a pool of his own blood .
poor bloke &apos;s been in a coma ever since .
why the hell is he here ?
he &apos;s an associate of ours , actually .
we take care of our own .
that &apos;s why you have elena .
cookie for you .
no , it turns out tyler
made contact with the armory during his hunter sojourns .
so when matt donovan needed help
with the vampire problem in mystic falls ,
he called tyler , who then called the armory ,
thinking they &apos;d put me away for good .
little did he know ...
they wanted me to work for them instead .
so here we all are .
in a cell .
that &apos;s how you take care of people ?
oh , don &apos;t worry about tyler .
we &apos;re simply keeping him alive
until his werewolf transformation stirs him awake
and heals him up .
shouldn &apos;t be long now .
i &apos;m sorry ... what ?
oh , did i forget to mention that tonight &apos;s a full moon ?
well , look , you &apos;re welcome to watch the show with me ,
on this side of the glass ,
just give me stefan &apos;s location .
thanks ...
but you know i &apos;m a sucker for the front row .
suit yourself .
we &apos;ll see how long that lasts .
damon put tyler in a coma .
bit of a hallucination mix @-@ up
that resulted in damon introducing tyler &apos;s skull
to the pavement several times .
if the armory hadn &apos;t found him , he &apos;d be a vegetable .
or dead .
ice ?
you knock me out , then offer me ice--
what &apos;s wrong with you ?
where &apos;s damon ?
i locked him in a room with tyler , on a full moon .
yes , you heard that right .
your bestie . your sidekick .
your humanity project .
the man who spins your moral compass in a tizzy .
if he doesn &apos;t give over stefan &apos;s location by the wolfing hour ,
he &apos;s a dead man .
phesmatos ossox .
what did you do to me ?
why won &apos;t my magic work ?
i injected you with one of the armory &apos;s toys .
you &apos;re in magical time out .
feel free to dispense with the menacing posture .
damon ?
hope i didn &apos;t wake you .
oh , what the hell is going on ?
good news , tween wolf .
you &apos;re about to get your sweet revenge on me .
what kind of a diner runs out of ketchup ?
i just got them to stop crying .
ooh , good .
now we can talk about nannies .
okay ,
obviously i thought we &apos;d have more time ,
so none of them are perfect ,
but i rated them out of 100 , based on their age ,
gpa and experience .
you know , i figured you &apos;d want someone intelligent
but not overly ambitious .
no , no , no , no , no .
okay , look , i @-@ i &apos;m gonna take elizabeth for a little walk .
do you mind watching josie ?
sorry .
ooh , why are you crying ?
you have a fresh diaper and a full belly .
and you have no idea how bad things can actually get .
those aren &apos;t gonna stop me , damon .
the second i turn , you &apos;re as good as dead .
you don &apos;t think i know that , copernicus ?
once bitten , twice shy .
it &apos;s taking me every ounce of willpower i have
not to send you to doggie heaven right now .
but you &apos;re not .
why ?
because up until yesterday , i thought elena was dead .
turns out , she &apos;s not .
and if she were ?
then what ?
you &apos;d kill me
because you have no one else to be accountable to ?
that should knock your ass out till the sun comes up .
good boy .
off to dream of squirrels and milk bones .
oh , that &apos;s not good .
open it !
sorry . members only , luv .
what happened to you ?
when did you become this person ?
&quot; this person &quot; ?
what , as opposed to the other person you were so fond of ?
at least that person knew what he wanted ,
and fought for it without steamrolling over everybody else .
where did that get me ?
lily &apos;s dead , i have nowhere to live , no town to call home .
the enzo you knew
didn &apos;t get what he wanted ; this one will .
and you want your family .
a family who dropped you at a work house ,
never came looking for you ,
who wiped all trace of their existence from your life .
you &apos;re willing to make an enemy
out of everyone ... for them ? !
when i told you damon was in trouble ,
you leapt to your feet ,
tried to stop me .
didn &apos;t matter what he &apos;d done , how he hurt tyler .
your first instinct was to help him .
that &apos;s what i want .
good .
i hope you find it .
easy , pal .
breathe . good boy .
these sedatives ... are messing with me .
they &apos;re slowing your transition . pick up , stefan .
really not a good time .
feeling &apos;s mutual , brother .
listen , you wouldn &apos;t happen to be at that place
valerie sent you to , would you ?
why ?
there &apos;s a chance i &apos;m gonna have to tango with a werewolf tonight ,
and it &apos;d suck a lot less if i knew there was an antidote en route .
what are you talking about ?
just answer the question , stefan !
i &apos;ll see what i can do .
so , where were we ?
siphon babies ,
vampire witch heretics ...
sounds like you &apos;ve been having quite a lot of fun
since last our paths crossed .
well , to be clear , caroline practically died in childbirth .
and she &apos;s not actually their mother .
it just sort of happened .
so she carried two lives in her womb ,
she gave birth to them ,
and now she plans to turn those cooing little faces over to alaric
without so much as a hiccup of hesitation .
yeah , you are probably right .
that does sound like the caroline i remember .
if you care for her as you say you do ,
why aren &apos;t you with her now ?
like i said , family drama .
speaking of , um ...
damon &apos;s found himself in a bit of a werewolf predicament .
i know i said he was a pain in the ass ,
but is there any chance you &apos;d be willing to spare some blood ?
just in case things go south .
that ...
is the mark of the phoenix sword .
you &apos;ve seen this before ?
tell me you have not been careless enough
to make an enemy of rayna cruz .
why do you think i &apos;m here , klaus ?
so you came here to hide ,
to seek refuge in my town ,
to enjoy the perks of my hospitality
in the city where my family sleeps ,
and all the while ,
you lure in a vicious hound with your scent .
she can &apos;t find me in this bar .
well , maybe not under this roof ,
but you are aware that she was born in new orleans ,
terrorized the quarter for years ,
thrust her blade through the heart of some of my best men ,
on the steps of st. anne &apos;s church .
she will pursue you until your paranoia and despair
far outweigh your desire to live .
here , elsewhere , or in hell , she will find you .
if you know how to outrun her , tell me what to do , klaus !
i &apos;ll tell you what you don &apos;t do .
you do not draw a huntress to a town full of vampires .
you do not drink my bourbon
whilst lying to my face ,
and you do not dare ask me favors ever again .
is that clear , old friend ?
get out .
if i leave , she &apos;ll kill me .
and if you stay , i will .
get ... out .
get out !
hello , luv .
who is this ?
ouch .
has it really been that long ?
klaus .
i know that sound all too well .
you might try picking her up .
hold on .
how am i talking to you right now ?
where is stefan ?
by the way , what &apos;s your stance on hand @-@ me @-@ downs ?
we have a chest that was once owned by louis xv .
it &apos;s being wasted on my daughter &apos;s outgrown onesies .
any interest ?
one--
these babies aren &apos;t mine . they &apos;re ric &apos;s ...
yes . that &apos;s been made abundantly clear to me by your boyfriend .
two-- i didn &apos;t call you .
i called stefan-- yes ,
my boyfriend-- who &apos;s currently running for his life
while i sit here playing worst @-@ case scenario .
except these babies , that aren &apos;t mine ,
won &apos;t stop crying , and now , this entire diner hates me .
so if you could refrain from gloating in the face of my misery ,
that would be very much appreciated .
stefan will be fine .
how do you know ?
because
i will ensure it .
so , here you are ,
in college , building a life for yourself .
plans , a future , things you want .
klaus , i &apos;m not doing this with you .
i take it , children were not involved in those plans .
no , they weren &apos;t .
luckily , these aren &apos;t mine .
so you &apos;ve mentioned .
you know ,
my family challenges the bounds of my sanity .
they drive me to do unspeakable things .
all the while , finding fresh
and inventive ways to torture me .
but , as it turns out ,
my family is what makes me truly happy .
it &apos;s not a crime to love what you cannot explain .
i was sorry
to hear about your mother , caroline .
i &apos;m sure she would have loved to see you with the little ones .
oh , my god , she &apos;s finally sleeping .
well , then , we mustn &apos;t wake her .
good @-@ bye , caroline .
why don &apos;t you just save your ass
and tell these people where stefan is .
&apos;cause stefan has a bad habit of taking bullets aimed at me .
and i thought i &apos;d give him the day off .
then maybe this is for the best ,
&apos;cause i &apos;m gonna turn and tear your throat out .
that way , nobody will ever have
to take a bullet for you again .
oh , my god . damon !
bonnie , open the door .
get out of here , bonnie !
it won &apos;t open !
you &apos;re a witch .
blink really hard .
i can &apos;t .
enzo gave me something that disabled my magic .
enzo opened it up with the palm of his hand .
you gotta get him down here right now .
it &apos;s not gonna happen .
why the hell not ?
tyler is one loose vertebrae away from making me his dinner ,
so figure this out ,
please .
no pressure .
bonnie .
this is what happens when you make enemies , enzo .
for the record , i would have made a better friend .
hello ?
hey , i lost my phone .
i had to pick up a burner .
stefan , thank god .
have you made it to new orleans ?
let &apos;s just say i wore out my welcome .
i &apos;m back on the road , and in a shocking turn of events ,
damon needs my help .
what are you talking about ?
worry about yourself . you need to go back .
dispatch just put an apb out
on a speeding motorcyclist traveling east on highway 90 .
woman , meets rayna &apos;s description ,
driving like a maniac .
did you hear that ? avoid 90 .
yeah , a little late for that .
where are you ?
traveling east on 90 .
i &apos;ll call you later .
what are you doing here ?
the right thing , i hope .
she &apos;s dead for now .
we need to go .
we need to grab her before she comes back to life .
stefan .
you are trespassing on dangerous ground .
trust me .
this is werewolf territory .
let &apos;s go .
easy , boy .
i do not want to kill you .
why , &apos; cause elena will dump your ass ?
and it would be a waste of a perfectly good i.v. stand .
if it &apos;s not me , it &apos;s going to be somebody else , damon .
there &apos;s no way in hell you &apos;re lasting 60 years
without royally screwing up .
bonnie should be here any second .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m talking about .
you open that door and i &apos;ll kill her , too .
there &apos;s always going to be something else .
your friends ...
my friends ...
they &apos;ll keeping risking their lives trying to save you
until they &apos;re all dead .
looks like you could use a hand .
bonnie , wait , don &apos;t .
i need to get you out of there .
bonnie , listen .
if you open that door , tyler will kill you , too .
i &apos;m not going to let you die in there .
this is my mess .
go .
go !
tyler !
tyler , stop !
bonnie ...
get the hell out of here .
no .
get out of here ...
or i will kill you .
okay . you &apos;re okay .
okay . there you go .
you &apos;re not healing .
why aren &apos;t you healing ?
bonnie !
bon !
found that laying around and thought you might need it .
guess that &apos;s the last time we let you watch the house .
actually , it &apos;s the last @-@ last time for anything .
i &apos;m through working for free .
catch the huntress yourself .
you said you wanted to know where you came from .
we just needed you to prove it .
for four months ?
four months of helping you .
four months of learning your mission statements ,
helping you track this woman with fake postcards and lies ,
scouring the globe .
four months that brought me nothing !
no answers .
no family .
consider our deal terminated .
your family is here , lorenzo .
your father founded the armory .
my father ?
this estate is where he lived and died .
what he left behind is your birthright .
what he left behind was me .
believe me , i know the feeling .
until tyler lockwood called us ,
i didn &apos;t know i had any family left either .
what are you talking about ?
my name is alexandria st. john .
i &apos;m your family , lorenzo .
the girls are asleep .
furniture is en route ,
electricity will be on by tomorrow morning ,
and i am starving .
mm , did you get a chance to look over the list of nannies ?
i did . i , um , i set up an interview
with the one that you rated at , uh , 89.75 % .
tracy . good , she was my first choice , too .
and i can compel her to lower her fee , if you want .
no , i @-@ i don &apos;t think that will be necessary .
i mean , really between scoring this house
and actually having the babies ,
you &apos;ve gone above and beyond .
well , then i guess my work here is done .
i think i &apos;ll stay the night ,
if that &apos;s okay with you .
just to make sure that the electrician
doesn &apos;t burn down the house tomorrow morning .
yeah , sure .
you can stay as long as you want .
bon .
fine . be that way .
ignore me .
by the way , once whatever crap enzo gave you
is out of your system and magic works on you again ,
i &apos;m going to give you my blood and heal you .
okay ?
but in the meantime , there &apos;s something i want you to know .
you are a terrible friend .
you know that ?
do you have any idea what i &apos;d have to go through
if you &apos;d have died today , huh ?
years of guilt .
crippling , self @-@ loathing guilt .
not to mention the resentment i &apos;d feel
if i was forced to break in a new drinking buddy .
you &apos;re not supposed to die for me , bon .
neither is my brother .
but no matter what i say
or how hard i try and drill it into your skulls ,
you &apos;re not going to stop trying .
which is why i have to take myself out of the equation .
it all ends tomorrow .
you &apos;ll never have to worry about me again .
there &apos;s a train station about a mile away .
you can just drop me off there .
do you love her ?
caroline ?
why ?
do you still have feelings for her ?
i have far too many complicated women in my life already .
caroline is the reason the tip of rayna &apos;s blade
ended up in your flesh , isn &apos;t she ?
you were protecting her .
no .
i was protecting damon .
then let her go , stefan .
let her go .
or spend an eternity
sacrificing everything good you have with her for your brother .
believe me , i &apos;ve spent an eternity
watching elijah do the same for me .
you missed the exit .
you &apos;re not going to the train station .
what ?
i have to get out of here .
we &apos;re going to see a witch .
i may have something that can help you
with your rayna cruz problem .
