For most peolple, hospital is a scary place,
a hustle place.
Ow!
Oh. Sorry.
It's mine.
A place where bad things happen.
Oh. You can't pay with that.
Oh. It's, uh... It's my A. Chip.
Six months sober.
Good for you.
Most people would prefer church or school...or home
Damn it. Will you stop crying?
You stop crying.
But I... grew up here.
While my mom was on rounds,
I learned to read in the O.R. gallery,
I played in the morgue,
I colored with crayons on old E.R. charts.
The hospital was my church...
my school...
my home.
The hospital was my safe place...
my sanctuary.
I love it here.
Correction--
loved it here.
圣殿
No way.
Yeah.
No freakin' way.
Right?
Oh, my god. O-okay. Um...
Were you trying to g--
No. Total accident. I used the thing.
Oh, so are we happy, uh, about this?
Or are we exercising our legal right to choose?
Okay. All right.
Congratulations. Let's hug it out.
Okay.
Oh, my god. Are you--are you-- are you gonna tell him?
Have you told him?
No, I just found out.
Oh, Teddy.
Derek.
Well, are you gonna tell him now?
Yeah.
Okay.
How is the Teddy and Owen thing going?
Oh. Oh, fantastic. It's going great.
I'm completely over it.
This is very adult.
I'm really proud of you, Meredith Grey.
I'm proud of me, too?
Yes, yes.
Okay.
Hey, I hope it has his hair.
Me, too.
Do you know where I could find the chief of surgery?
Excuse me.
Chief of surgery?
No idea. Sorry.
Go ask a nurse if you can find 'em.
You paged?
She's in a lot of pain.
Okay. Uh, Ruby Kendall, age 9.
Fever, tenderness over mcburney's point.
All right, appendix. Let me check your belly.
Oh, yeah. You have a very angry appendix.
That's surgery?
She needs surgery?
Yes, she does, but the good news is,
it's the easiest surgery in the world.
I mean, she's a baby surgeon and she could do it.
What, you're gonna let me do it?
You're going to let her do the surgery?
Oh, no, no, no, no. No, of course not.
I'm gonna do it. I'm kinda fabulous at it.
And, Ruby, you are gonna be outta here by tomorrow
with a teeny, tiny little scar
and a very good excuse
to have your parents feed you ice cream
every night of the week.
Dr. Grey, admit her to peds and make sure she's comfortable
while we get an O.R.
What?
Jason Perkins, 6 year old with a comminuted tibia fracture.
And you could be nicer to me, 'cause he peed his pants,
And I cleaned it up before you got here.
Sorry. Good man, Alex. Thanks.
Hi.
You got paged, too?
Come on, Teddy.
Cristina's not talking to me. You're not talking to me.
Come on.
I don't want to talk about it.
I don't want to go over again
how you told Derek to give my job away.
I don't want to discuss it or hear you apologize
or forgive you or anything.
You know what I want? A little bit of peace.
Start another I.V. Get an 18-guage.
What do we got?
Get ready to move him.
Shut up.
I'm sorry. I'm truly sorry.
Honey, are you hearing this?
I told you. You know, I told her, Dr. Bailey?
That doesn't mean I like it.
I really can't have my second surgery today?
Dr. Percy?
Your hemoglobin and hematocrit are extremely low.
Your bank is empty. You need a blood transfusion
before we can operate.
Shut up.
Yes, ma'am.
Do you know how long
I've been living with a colostomy bag?
A bag of my poop is attached to me.
Do you know what that's like? It's gross.
It's truly the grossest thing I've ever had to deal with.
And I'm starving
Because I can't eat solid food for 24 hours before surgery.
Starving. I would eat you if I could.
Yeah, on the plus side, that means no poop in the bag.
Bill.
Okay, we're gonna get some blood and urine.
Dr, Percy is gonna monitor your blood levels.
And tomorrow, we'll see if we can help lose the poop bag.
And let's get you some food so you don't eat Dr. Percy.
I don't like him, but he's useful.
Can I have real food? Like pizza...
From that one place near that one spot
With, um, pepperoni and sausage and ham?
If you get the pizza, you also get
The bowel prep and enema that comes with it.
Totally worth the pizza! Bring it on.
Back in 15 minutes.
Oh, how hot is my husband's ass?
It's... Very hot, ma'am.
He's dead, isn't he? Is he dead?
He's not dead, ma'am. Okay?
You can't go in there. The doctors are working.
He has a serious gunshot wound.
They need to be able to concentrate
on-- they said that he was in a car accident.
He--he was shot? Someone shot him? Oh! Oh! I-I--
Pete. Oh, my god. Pete! Please.
Wait. Please. Pete. Pete?
Extend your incision.
This guy hit me.
Good. Okay, get in there with the hemostats.
I stopped the car to give him my insurance card.
ATS are still dropping.
I-I get out And he shoots me.
apply some more pressure.
systolic in the 70s.
I'm in. Chest tube.
How could... Wait. Pete? Pete?!
Bag him.
There's blood in his chest.
Clamp that. Got the port-a-vac.
Clamp here.
Call the O.R. Tell them we're on our way.
Let's get him ready to transport.
They're taking him to surgery. Please, he's my husband!
Let me say good-bye. Please.
Let--let her--let her say good-bye.
Owen, there's no time.
Good-bye, baby.
I love you. I love you, okay? Don't die, 'cause I love you.
Oh, god. What's happening?!
Out of here now. Chest tube secure.
You wasted time there wasn't time to waste.
There was time.
That might be the last time she sees the man she loves.
There was time.
You paged? Oh, are you heading to the o.R.?
Yeah, but I need you to covermy my post-ops. I'm sorry
I'm--I'm not going into surgeith you?
Cristina
I'm talking to Dr. Altman.
I need you to cover my post-ops.
Okay. Fine. No problem. I'll do it.
Let's go.
Okay, we're running.
Watch out. Coming through.
Clear that hall.
Excuse me. I was asking if someone could tell me
Where I could find the chief
I'm sorry, sir.
If you could just give me a minute, okay?
coming through.
yeah, it is. The lead was loose.
Okay, I'll let him know. Hold on.
Excuse me, ma'am.
It's doctor. What? I was wondering if you could tell me
Where I could find dr. Derek shepherd?
Um, you know, I don't know.
Can you tell me where his office is?
I'm kinda turned around here.
Sir, you know, I have a patient having seizures in there.
Go find a nurse and ask them.
Ma'am.
Look, you're not even supposed to be back here.
I'm not a tour guide. I'm a surgeon. Okay?
Dude, what the--
Hey. You paged?
Yeah, I like to say hello to my wife every 48 hours.
You didn't come home last night.
I told you, every Tuesday night, I'm trolling for cases.
Last night, a guy crashed his motorcycle,
Had rebar jammed in the base of his skull,
And shadow shepherd let me do the extraction.
You know what I've been doing?
Paperwork. You know what I have to look forward to today?
More paperwork. This job is just--
I would love to have something jammed I brain.
That way, I'd see the inside of an O.R.
Okay.
Well, uh, are you gonna come home early tonight?
Because we can order in, and I have some stuff to tell you.
Yeah. I'll be there.
I have to go. I'm on Sloan's post-ops.
I hate that you're so happy.
Derek, there's gonna be a lot of dirty sex for you tonight.
Look forward to that.
I'm looking at injuries to the pulmonary artery and vein.
Hold pressure in there. More lap bands.
Let's try a temporary satinsky clamp.
Dr. Altman, Mr. Linehan has hemolytic anemia
and elevated L.D.H.
I suspect post-operative T.T.P.
Shall I start exchange plasmapheresis?
Yes. Good catch, Cristina.
Hold on, Dr. Yang. We need to open up the pericardium
to gain proximal control.
Dr. Yang should scrub in.
And Mr. Linehan can wait for an hour.
Uh, no, thank you. I'd rather not scrub in.
Keep this stable.
Dr. Altman, I will be right back.
Cristina--
You know what? You pursued me. I didn't--
I gave you an out, and you pursued me.
You said--you said-- and I still--
Do you love her? Or do you love me?
I'm done. We're done.
Cristina--
I'm done.
Are they came there?
April, what is it?
Did you know I-- I grew up on a farm?
What happened?
I, uh, I grew up on a farm, so, you know, blood--
Blood doesn't-- doesn't bother me.
I...
I slaughtered a pig once. That was a lot of blood.
Bleeding like a stuck pig--
You know, that's a--that's a saying.
To bleed like a pig, you know, it means something.
But you don't-- you don't think of people as having that m-much blood.
You learn in med school how many pints we all have in us,
But you don't realize it until you see it.
You don't get how m--how much blood-- and a skinny person.
I mean, my god, Reed, she's--she's--
She's like, almost anorexic. She's like 5 pounds.
You--you wouldn't think she'd have that much blood in her,
But she--she did. She did. I mean,
She-- She--
April. April. April. April.
April. April. Shh. You're in shock.
It's all right. Tell me what happened.
Reed's dead.
Someone shot her.
Excuse me. Could you tell me where to find the chief?
Dr. Shepherd? He's, uh, probably in his office.
Yeah, I've been to his office before.
I can't seem to rember how to get there.
I keep going in circles.
It's--it's in the east wing.
That's over by labs, across the catwalk.
Sorry? That's--
You just gotta cross through the patient floor on three,
and then follow the signs to the main lobby,
and then you should find it no problem.
Thank you.
Have a nice day.
You, too.
The police are on their way.
What's the procedure?
You're the head of hospital security.
How do you not know? I know it's never happened before.
Oh, I found it. Lockdown. Nobody moves in or out.
Yeah. Nobody moves, nobody breathes
until we know what's going on.
Here.
The police are almost here.
I'm gonna leave you here. You gonna be okay by yourself?
You're leaving? You--you just said that--that nobody leaves,
nobody moves, nobody breathes.
Nobody but me.
I'm the chief. This is my hospital.
But what if you get shot or--or--
I'll be right back. I'm the chief.
Uh, Jason Perkins?
Uh, I got the chart here somewhere.
Peds.
Can you page the younger Dr. Grey for me
and tell her to get my appy moving?
We're on lockdown.
What? Why?
Oh, come on.
Well, it's a joke, right? It's a drill or something?
Okay. It's no joke.
Everyone. Everyone.
We're sealing the floor.
I don't know why, and it doesn't matter why,
but nobody goes in or out past the double doors.
You check on your own patients, and then you come back
And check and see if there's any others in the queue.
We don't have a lot of hands on deck.
And, people, do not alarm the makers of the tiny humans.
They will eat you alive. Let's go.
I really thought that was a joke.
A sick joke.
Excuse me?
Uh, nothing.
What?
What, you can't be stuck on the same floor as me?
That's a hardship for you?
Uh, yeah. Frankly, it is.
Hey. How are we?
Bill hasn't come back with my pizza yet,
so still starving.
But full of fresh blood,
Which is disgusting, like I'm a vampire.
Mary, you complain too much.
But I do it with a smile.
Face it. I'm an awesome patient.
I make your day.
Hmm. Let's see.
What's wrong?
Nothing. J-just a... Page.
I can't get control of this artery. He's crashing.
All right, I need more light and another clamp.
How's it gong in here?
Touch and go.
Avery, you got a second?
Has anybody checked their pager?
No, we've been too busy.
There's a shooter in the hospital.
I don't want you to say a word. When the patient is stable...
I want you to tell Hunt and Altman
that nobody goes out of here until they are told.
Can you handle this?
Yes, sir.
All right.
Okay. Okay, B.P. is dropping.
I've almost got the pulmonary artery under control.
Just give me one more second.
What did Shepherd want?
Dr. Avery?
Nothing. Um, just wanted to know how long we'd be.
He needs the O.R. Next.
Okay, get in here
And suction around where Dr. Altman's working.
Shaky hands, Dr. Avery?
Won't make it as a surgeon
if you can't keep your hands steady.
Yes, sir.
Did you get that page? Lockdown?
Yeah. I mean, whatever. It means we can't leave.
I never leave here anyway so what do I care?
You know what? It's probably just a drill.
Or, like, a psych patient got out
Or a baby went missing from the nursery...
Or there's a--there's an ax murderer on the loose.
Ax murderer would be fun.
Mm-hmm. So? How did he react?
I mean, was his world made whole
bcecause your womb is not empty and dry?
Did he weep like a bitch baby?
I didn't tell him because he was in a mood.
So I'll tell him later tonight or something.
I mean, it should be special, right? -
Well, I mean, you found out
in the ladies room squatting over a stick.
I mean, that wasn't very special.
Why does he get special?
I don't know.
I feel like my head's gonna pop off
Because I haven't told him and I want to and I hate that.
It's good news. He should know, right?
You know what? I'm telling him now.
Okay.
What--
Well, I'm coming.
Well, I want to see the bitch baby tears.
Cristina-- I'll just stand in the hallway.
He'll never know I'm there.
I, um...
I-I broke up with Owen. Okay?
Okay.
Come on.
They want attending approval
to do the auditory evoked potentials.
Can you sign for it?
Lockdown. Kinda crazy, right?
You think it's, uh, serious?
Can you just sign the order?
This Karev thing serious?
Mark.
I miss you.
Can you just sign the order?
Sir, you can't leave this area. The hospital is in--
Get down! Get down!
Get down! What just happened?!
he shot the nurse! Get down!
No, no, no, no, no. No, no. Vivian.
Come on.
Come on.
She's dead. She's--
I'm getting you out of here. Come on. Move, move, move!
Out of my way. Get out of my way.
Come on! Come on!
Excuse me.
...Couple guys and go around.
Have you talked to the administrator?
No, sir.
Officer, what's the situation?
Sir, you gotta stand back.
Look, I'm Richard Webber. I'm--I'm the chief--
I'm the former--
Look, this is my hospital. What's going on?
A shooter took down one of the doctors.
and we're not sure whether or not he's still inside.
No, sir, sir, sir. No one in, no one out.
The--the S.W.A.T. Team is on the way, sir.
No one in, no one out.
Are you evacuating people?
Are you getting them out of there?
Because-- department policy is a lockdown.
until we know who the shooter is,
where the shooter is, everyone stays in the same place.
It's safer that way.
Those are my people in there.
If someone is shooting, I'd--
My guys have this. We do. We're gonna take care of it.
Okay?
okay.
What--what--what happened?
I grabbed everything I could think of.
I am... So... Incredibly pissed off right now.
Alex,you've been shot.
We have to get him out of here.
He could come back, Mark.
We have to get him out of here.
There's no exit wound.
No exit wound. We're gonna have to flip him.
Lexie,grab him under the shoulders.
We have to get him outta here.
Lexie,he'losing blood. We can't move him.
now shut up and help.
nothing.
Oh,damn. The bullet's still in there somewhere.
we're just gonna have to wing it. Start an I.V.
I'll set up a chest tube.
You're gonna be okay,alex. All right?
I'm gonna kick that guy's ass when I see him.
Has anybody seen olivia kagan's chart?
Uh,I need albuterol nebs for the asthma kid.
It's time for 18's dose of ceftriaxone.
34 needs his mommy.
And the kid in 35 won't stop crying.
We have,what,42 kids,
four doctors and nine nurses? It's not enough. All right.
Why don't you just put all the kids in the room?
I mean,we don't have enough staff for a whole floor.
So at least they'll all be in one place,one big room.
We can keep an eye on all the kids at once.
You can't put a bunch of sick kids in the playroom
With their beds and everything--
n-sure--sure we can. Stable ones can walk,
And we have wheelchairs,so let's do it. Move.
Thanks.
Whatever.
Well,do you want to talk about it?
No.
Owen,I mean...
I know what you mean. I don't want to--
I,um,I-I can't. It's just...
Okay,he doesn't know,you know,who he loves,
And if it's not me,then...
I don't want to talk about it.
Let's talk about something else.
Okay.
You realize,you're about to be a godmother?
I'm godmother?
Okay,what do I have to do?
Like,talk god to the fetus?
'cause I'm not gonna do that.
It means,you take care of the kid if I die.
Derek takes care of the kid if you die.
If we die,if we die.
Okay,so...
If you and derek are in a plane crash and you die,
The kid is mine?
Yes.
I have to admit,I kindhope,
Uh,you and derek die,just a little bit,
So I can raise the kid with decent priorities.
I have priorities.
Oh?
Surgery.
Oh,okay,then.
You can raise a good little surgeon.
I take it back.
Hey. What are you doing here?
Uh,walkin
We're in lockdown.
Yeah,we're not walking outside.
That's not what lockdown means.
It means stay where you are.
Did you know that's what it--
no,I thought it meant--
Stay here. Get in here.
What? Why are we--
There's a shooter loose in the hospital.
What?
Stay here. Don't move. I'll come back and get you
When it's clear.
Just stay here. Don't move.
Okay,your pulse is coming down.
We have to check your blood counts,
But I think you'll be good to go
For surgery tomorrow.
That's the fifth time you've checked your pager.
Uh,just--it's habit.
Dr. B... My husband's late.
He's never late,and you're hanging out with me.
You don't really strike me as the hanging-out type.
What's going on?
Okay,th-there is a-a situation.
I'm not exactly sure what it is.
But,um,hospital procedure dictates that when we're on a--
he's on the floor.
Who?
The shooter.
A shoot--there's a shooter in the hospital?
Oh,my god.
sir,it's all right,all right?
Put the gun down. Come on,man. Don't do anything.
No,please! I have a family!
sir!
Uh,dr. Percy,hide.
What?
Just hide. Mary,okay,play dead.
Wait. Wait. What's happening?
Shh. Just do not move.
Do not breathe. Dr. Percy,go hide,now.
Oh. This is too much.
Okay. Okay.
Okay, okay.
Okay.
Okay, okay.
Please. I--
Are you a surgeon?
Please.
Are you a surgeon?
Yes, sir.
Yes, s-sir. I am.
Oh, no, no. No.
Oh, no, please.
No! No! No! No! No!
Are you-- are you a surgeon?
Answer me!
N-no.
N-no. No.
I'm a...
a-a nurse.
I'm--I'm a--I'm a nurse.
I'm--I'm--I'm a nur-nurse.
I'm sorry...
for the trouble...
for the mess.
I'm sorry.
Oh, g--oh, g--
Oh, g--
You're doing great, Alex. Really great.
Now I need to put in a chest tube. You with me? Okay?
No, no chest tube.
I'm okay.
Don't cut me.
Lexie, you get the betadine ready,
and I'll do the rest, okay?
Okay.
Okay.
Oh, god.
Oh, my god.
Shut him up. Shut him up.
Oh, my god.
Oh, god.
Alex.
Okay, okay.
Shut him up, Lexie. If that guy with the gun
hears the screaming, he's gonna head this way.
Now do something to shut him up.
Okay, okay. Alex.
I know that it hurts, but you have to be quiet.
Okay?
Lexie!
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
The bad news is, less privacy.
But the good news is, is that your bunny can make friends
with a very attractive bear from down the hall.
Cool.
Hey, watch it.
Oh, sorry, sorry.
I thought we were gonna be friends.
You want to talk about this now? We're on lockdown,
moving kids, god knows what's happening,
and you want to talk about this?
Well, we're stuck here and we have to be together,
so, yeah, I want to talk about this.
Okay, fine. I tried being friends.
Rising above--I tried that, and now I'm over it.
I'm gonna go the more traditional route
of totally hating your guts.
Okay, Christopher, Tyler.
Tyler, Christopher. You both hate chicken.
Discuss.
Yes, I'm a vegan, too.
I don't deserve this, okay?
I have treated you with nothing but respect and love--
Oh, no. See, that's the thing.
You think you have, but you haven't.
I'm sure that it feels great to act like I'm the bad guy,
but that's the biggest load of you know what I've ever heard.
I have spent the last month trying to convince myself
that I don't need kids to be happy--
Really trying-- giving lectures to myself,
saying it out loud to you to Mark
and turning myself inside out to want what you wanted.
And then I stopped for a second, and I thought,
Did you ever try to imagine what it would
be like to change for me? Because I don't think you did.
What you did was you dismissed my dream--my dream--
Which says to me that you don't give a rat's ass if I'm happy.
I never understood squat about who you are.
And now I do, and I don't like it.
Oh, really, really, really?
I'm supposed to change for you? Why,
because we're in love?
I mean, because you fall in love all the time--men, women--
Excuse me. Dr. Robbins. I don't feel good.
oh, my--oh, my--
He shot me. I'm shot.
You are going to be okay.
Mary, over there is s-some gauze and some surgical pads.
Can you get them for me?
Nope. I-I gotta go. I gotta go home. I--
We shouldn't be here. My husband--
I have to find my husband.
And that man, he could come back in here--
Mary. Mary.
You're not going anywhere. Okay?
That man is t coming back.
I need you to pull yourself together,
bring me those supplies. Okay?
I was doing charts,and now I'm shot?
Okay, okay. You're just fine. You're just fine. Ah.
Thank you. Okay. Good. Very good.
All right, mary...
uh, go over to the window, all right?
And look and see if there's anybody out there
that can help us.
Mary, come on, come on, come on. Go to the window now. Ah!
And just see if somebody can help us. Go on. Go on.
Okay.
Um,there's...
There's a... Aah!
A dead security guard.
He's dead.
And there's no one else to help us.
There's no one else.
It's all right. It's all right.
That's fine. That's...
Where--where is that water coming from?
Dr. Bailey, you're crying.
You're crying.
Then, uh, m-mary...
You need to c-come over here and wipe my face
so that I can keep working.
oh, okay, okay.
We're all gonna be fine.
Okay, he's ready for transport.
Okay, Jackson, get him up to ICU.
Start warming him up and draw an ABG.
I can't, sir.
Excuse me?
We can't leave here.
That's what Shepherd told me. There's a shooter in the hospital.
We're supposed to stay here--
There's a what?
Shepherd said that we're--
this patient is hypothermic.
I need to get him to an ICU,
Start warming him up before
he starts to circle the drain.
Well,shepherd said--
You didn't bother to mention this until now?
Shepherd said--
You didn't bother to tell me this until n-
Well, Shepherd said--
You already told me what Shepherd said.
Okay.
I'll take him up myself.
Everyone else,stay here.
I'm coming.
No, no, you stay put.
I'm a cardiothoracic surgeon.
He has a penetrating injury to his chest.
You don't get a vote this time. I'm coming. Let's go.
Her blood pressure's 90 over 60 and dropping.
Let's hang some more fluids.
I have the portable ultrasound.
All right, check her appendix. I will be right back.
When are you gonna forgive me
for not being a good enough lesbian for you?
When you do something to convince me that
you're falling in love with me and not with being in love.
When you do something to convince me that
I'm different than George O'malley,
Erica Hahn, Mark Sloan
Or the girl at the coffee cart.
I mean, you have a huge heart, and I love that about you.
But I don't trust you. Why would I?
Dr. Robbins... her appendix...
Mm. You okay?
I've been hurling every day this week around--
Yep, right on schedule.
Okay, we gotta get outta here,
'cause... Uh, I'm not staying in here
after you stink up this place with your vomit.
Oh, my god. Oh, my god.
Oh, my god. Meredith, get down.
What? What?
I don't--
That's the guy from the elevator.
What do you mean? What
It's the guy from the elevator.
He asked me for directions,
how to get to the chief's office.
I-I don't--I don't--
Meredith, the guy with the gun is looking for Derek
Dr. Shepherd.
Sir, you shouldn't be here. It's not safe.
I know it's not safe here.
That's the point.
This hospital isn't safe.
You don't recognize me, do you?
Mr. Clark. Sorry. I was--
There's a lot going on here. I have a situation.
You should go someplace safe so you don't get hurt.
I'm already hurt.
You hurt me when you decided to kill my wife.
BP's 60 palp. He's losing a lot of blood. Damn it.
He needs a transfusion.
I don't know what we're gonna do.
I'll go.
I'll go get it.
That's insane. I'll go.
No. I don't-- I don't know what to do.
You know what to do. I-I don't--I...
I can't do nothing.
Alex...
Don't die.
Please don't die.
Okay? It's me. It's Lexie.
I will be right back.
I will be right back.
Hey,Sloan.
Try not to kill me.
I'm doing my best.
Oh,my god. Oh,god.
Mr. Clark.
Shut up. No talking.
You're not the man here. I'm the man.
I'm the man.
I told my wife I would be.
I'm the man...
And a man looks after his wife.
But I didn't.
I let you decide that she should die.
I wasn't a man then. But I'm man now.
no. No,no,no,no,no.
Okay, Mary...
Mary,see the st-sticky circles there?
Can you give me three of those?
And--Mary! Give me three of those,please,
And the other thing.
Okay,yeah.
Um,this--this thing?
No,not that thing.
The other thing,with the--with the wires.
I'm dying.
Shh. Shh.
No,you're not dying.
Really? Don't lie to me.
Don't tell me that lie we tell everybody--
"You're fine. You're doing great."
Don't lie to me.
Please. You gotta promise to tell me the truth. Okay?
Okay,you are not dying.
If you were,I would tell you,okay?
Okay.
Okay,that's there.
you are not dying.
Okay,Mary,hold Dr. Percy's hand,please.
Good.
stay here.
What kind of hospital is this?
Is it safe here?
Somebody has to protect people...
From you...
Handing down judgments like you're god...
Mr. Clark,please--
You don't get to be god. Pl--
No talking!
Just...
Mr. Clark,listen to me.
I know your loss.
I lost my father...
When I was a kid.
Two guys killed my father for his watch
Right in front of me...
Right in front of me.
I didn't become a doctor because I wanted to be god.
I became a doctor because I wanted to save lives.
Look at me.
Please.
Look at me in the eye.
I'm a human being.
I make mistakes.
I'm flawed.
We all are.
Today I think...
For you,is just a mistake.
You want justice.
You want somebody to pay.
You're a good man.
I can see that in your eyes.
Can you see it in mine?
Can you?
Oh, Shepherd. Thank god you're back.
I learned to read in the O.R. Gallery.
I played in the morgue.
I colored with crayons on old E.R. Charts.
The hospital was my church,my school,
My home...
My safe place,
My sanctuary.
I love it here.
Correction--
Loved it here.
