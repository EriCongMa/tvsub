renee confronted lynette .
look , you and tom tried to make it work , and you couldn &apos;t .
now he &apos;s moved on .
carlos agreed to go into rehab .
i know a great place .
i can call tomorrow .
susan &apos;s secret work of art ...
no one can see these !
fueled the detective &apos;s suspicions ...
all i see is four women that killed a guy
with a candlestick
and dumped his body in the woods .
and drove a wedge between friends .
more secrets ?
what did you think you were doing ?
i was protecting you !
yeah , well , great job .
whenever bree van de kamp was feeling low ...
she found solace in the act of baking .
when her first husband passed away ,
she made coffee cake .
when her second husband went to jail ,
she made sugar cookies .
and when her teenage daughter got pregnant ,
she made creme brulee .
so when bree &apos;s best friends stopped speaking to her ,
she hoped that her warm cherry scones
might thaw their chilly relationship .
susan .
hey , sweetie . is your mom home ?
uh , no . she &apos;s at ... church .
on a thursday ?
she told you to say that , didn &apos;t she ?
only if it was you .
if it was the priest ,
i &apos;m supposed to say she &apos;s reading to the blind .
will you stop pounding ?
i just put paige down .
i &apos;m sorry , but no one will talk to me .
really ? i wonder why that is .
look , i have made a mess of things ,
but i want to make it up to you all .
you really think you can bake your way out of this one ?
of course not . it &apos;s just a peace offering ,
a way to begin the conversation .
i have nothing to discuss with you ,
not after the way you and gaby lied to me .
lynette , please understand .
i was only trying to protect you , all of you .
no ! you were trying to control us
the way you try and control everything .
that &apos;s not fair .
you told us that as long as we trusted each other
and stuck together , everything would be fine .
it will be . as long as we have our friendship ,
they can &apos;t do anything to us .
don &apos;t you get it ? there is no us .
there is no friendship . not anymore .
you &apos;re on your own .
we all are .
yes , bree had always taken comfort in baking .
but when baking failed her ,
she took comfort in something else .
in a place as peaceful as wisteria lane ,
the smallest crime can prompt a call to the police ...
when a neighborhood kid makes a reckless mistake ...
when children need to be taught a lesson ...
when the teenagers next door start a band .
yes , the women of wisteria lane
were used to calling the police .
what they weren &apos;t used to was having the police ... call them .
so ... what &apos;s going on ?
not sure .
no one &apos;s talked to us yet .
do you think we need a lawyer ?
i don &apos;t know . maybe susan can paint one for us .
lawyers won &apos;t be necessary , ladies .
this is not an official investigation .
it &apos;s just a--it &apos;s just a casual conversation among friends .
but if you want to bring lawyers into it ,
i can open a case file , take your fingerprints .
no . no . we like the friend thing .
great . so the first friend i &apos;d like to talk to is ...
susan .
try my coffee .
the guys are always complimenting me on it .
thanks . i &apos;m trying to cut down on caffeine .
gets you all jittery and nervous ?
yeah . i hate that .
so you feeling jittery and nervous right now ?
what ?
n @-@ no . absolutely not .
uh , yum .
my compliments .
why &apos;d you paint this ?
uh , why ?
it &apos;s ... hard to say
why artists ... paint what they do .
gosh , that probably sounded so ... artsy .
no , not really .
i would imagine it &apos;s even possible
that the artist herself doesn &apos;t really know why she did it .
sometimes you say to yourself ...
&quot; where the heck did that come from ?
&quot; maybe i shouldn &apos;t have eaten
that pepperoni pizza before bed . &quot;
or maybe you say to yourself ,
&quot; i feel so guilty about what i did . &quot;
i @-@ i @-@ i don &apos;t ...
i mean , who ... who is that ?
the guy in your painting .
the one in the grave .
no .
uh , uh , no .
that came from my imagination .
bull . it &apos;s him .
ramon sanchez .
a missing person from oklahoma .
i don &apos;t know anything about that .
that isn &apos;t a painting , susan .
it &apos;s a guilty conscience trying to find peace ,
but it never will , ever ...
until you tell the truth .
so you &apos;ve never seen this guy before ?
you already asked me that ,
and i told you . no .
you know something , lynette ? you &apos;d have made a good cop .
you know how to stay cool , keep your emotions in check .
listen to me .
you women are good people . i know that .
but you &apos;re obviously covering something up .
now forget about me being a cop , okay ?
let me tell you something as a friend .
a jury will forgive a lot when they understand
why something happened .
but first , you have to stop lying .
i &apos;m not lying .
how much more of a toll
are you gonna let this thing take on you ?
what does that mean ?
it means that whatever it is you &apos;ve done ,
it &apos;s clearly the reason your husband walked out on you .
sorry .
but you said to forget you were a cop .
huh . look at that .
what happened to keeping your cool ?
recognize him ?
sorry .
you wanna look at it for two seconds before you answer ?
i got nothing .
can i go ?
he &apos;s a person , gaby .
he has two kids ,
not much older than yours .
two girls , who may never see their daddy again .
i don &apos;t know him .
now may i leave ? i have a lot of things to do .
oh , yeah ? like what ?
visiting your husbsbd in rehab ?
i heard about his drinking .
i &apos;m sorry .
yeah . well , the good news is
it looks like we nipped it in the bud .
oh , it &apos;s a new problem ?
yeah . why ?
usually there &apos;s a trigger
when somebody starts abusing alcohol out of the blue .
anything come to mind ? anything stressful ?
he ...
he had an affair .
carlos ?
that &apos;s hard to believe .
i know , right ? i mean , who would cheat on this ?
i meant because he seems like such a good man .
well , he &apos;s not . he &apos;s a cad , a philandering s.o.b. ,
but i love him .
so if i go there tomorrow
and ask carlos that same question ...
he &apos;d give me the same answer ?
you bet .
great .
i might just do that .
i &apos;ll have another , please .
okay .
you got a friend who can drive you home ?
no .
turns out i &apos;m friendless at the moment .
but don &apos;t worry . i &apos;ll take a taxi .
you ladies sound like you &apos;re having fun !
what &apos;s the occasion ?
just , you know , girls &apos; night out .
left the kids and husbands at home .
whoo @-@ hoo ! i &apos;ll drink to that .
yeah .
amen to that , sister .
i mean , who needs families when we &apos;ve got girlfriends ?
am i right ?
i &apos;m sorry . who are you ?
oh , where are my manners ?
bree van de kamp .
i heard you all carrying on , and , well ,
really , i &apos;ve been feeling a little disconnected lately ,
and i thought , &quot; bree , a little human contact is
just what you need . &quot;
uh , yeah , kelly just had a baby ,
and we haven &apos;t seen each other for a while , so we were hoping--
a baby ! oh , that &apos;s wonderful . well , we need to celebrate .
bottle of champagne !
it &apos;s on me .
so how do we all know each other ?
well , these two i know from college ,
and you i know from randomly sitting down at our table .
god , i miss this .
and then one day ,
you wake up and you realize you &apos;ve got nothing .
nothing .
your children abandon you .
even the gay one .
i mean ,
aren &apos;t gay men supposed to be obsessed with their mothers ?
as far as relationships go , forget it .
two of them left me .
three of them are dead .
and all of this i could bear as long as i had my girlfriends .
but now they &apos;ve abandoned me , too .
everything i touch ...
everything i love ...
well , on that note , i think i &apos;ll call it a night .
same here .
wait . it &apos;s barely midnight--
awfully early for four single gals like us .
we &apos;re all married .
you don &apos;t have to rub it in , lynette .
stop calling me lynette . it &apos;s really creeping me out .
wait . i &apos;ve got an idea .
why don &apos;t you all come back to my place
and we can have a sleepover ?
good night .
no . no , please-- please come home with me .
i @-@ i have a really big house with lots of empty rooms and--
okay , lady . you want me to call you your cab yet ?
no .
i &apos;m just gonna finish lynette &apos;s champagne .
ben .
hello .
how you feeling ?
fine . why do you ask ?
you don &apos;t remember last night , do you ?
of course i do .
really ? what do you remember ?
i went out to dinner with a few girlfriends ,
came home , and went to bed .
uh , close .
you knocked on my door at 2 : 00 in the morning to borrow money ,
&apos;cause the cab driver wouldn &apos;t take
the fried zucchini you had in your purse .
then you cursed at me for not making you pancakes
before you stumbled back to your house .
how long you been off the wagon ?
a few days .
i &apos;d appreciate it if you wouldn &apos;t tell anyone .
it &apos;s just a temporary relapse .
i &apos;ll get it under control .
isolating yourself is only gonna make matters worse .
you got a great group of friends .
reach out to them .
i can &apos;t .
we &apos;re not on speaking terms right now .
well , i &apos;m sure you can fix that .
i tried .
but they all seem to hate me .
well , my recommendation ?
start with the one who hates you the least .
oh . not ready for that .
it &apos;s a beautiful day .
i &apos;d hate for you to waste another one with a hangover .
thank you , ben .
see ya .
i know chuck could tell i was lying .
i always do that thing when i lie .
wh @-@ what thing ?
oh , like i &apos;m gonna tell you .
you have no idea how terrifying it was .
look , have a drink .
it &apos;ll calm you down .
i don &apos;t want a drink .
really ?
of course i want a drink .
see ? i &apos;m a terrible liar .
look , if chuck had something concrete ,
we &apos;d know .
i &apos;m sure he &apos;s just fishing .
he is not gonna let up .
he is just waiting till i crack .
honey , you &apos;re panicking over nothing .
the body &apos;s gone .
chuck doesn &apos;t have a case without it .
no , the only way this thing blows up is if somebody talks .
are you not listening to me ?
i talk . me .
i &apos;m the one who &apos;s gonna send us away .
we need to get out of town ,
just for a few weeks ,
until chuck finds someone else to focus on .
not only would that look incredibly suspicious ,
we don &apos;t have the kind of money to do something like that .
okay . money .
we need money .
we can have a garage sale .
grab some chairs . i &apos;ll put up some flyers .
trust me .
we &apos;re gonna stay here ,
and everything is gonna be fine .
you &apos;re an even worse liar than i am .
hello .
someone is never gonna finish &quot; the help . &quot;
what can i do for you ?
i need to speak with my husband , carlos solis .
is it an emergency ?
no . i just need to tell him something .
then i can &apos;t allow you .
mr. solis is still on restricted access .
what does that mean ?
uh , first week after admission , no visitors ,
cell phones , or e @-@ mails .
no distractions .
we only want our patients to focus on getting better .
okay , but i really need to talk to him .
i &apos;m sorry .
those are the rules .
well , rules are made to be broken .
i &apos;m sure there &apos;s a &quot; no boobs on the counter &quot; rule , too .
seriously ?
male nurse .
right .
you can come back on tuesday .
it &apos;s all my fault !
it wasn &apos;t your fault .
i should &apos;ve seen the signs . it was mine .
i was never around .
kid didn &apos;t have a role model .
we &apos;re getting you help , jimmy .
they &apos;re gonna take care of you here .
i don &apos;t need this place .
i told you . i don &apos;t have a problem .
manzani . we called .
admissions is right through that door .
thank you . come on . it &apos;s gonna be all right .
we should &apos;ve seen this coming .
jimmy , we &apos;re only doing this because we love you .
such a tragedy . so much potential .
all right , gotta go .
excuse me .
where are you supposed to be ?
oh , uh , i &apos;m with them-- the manzinis .
if you &apos;re with the family ,
you need to stay for group counseling .
oh , i don &apos;t think i have much to contribute .
it &apos;s vital .
this way .
come on , tom .
i know you &apos;re there .
fine . i &apos;ll get in another way and pound on your door until you open up .
yes ?
hola .
my name is maria .
i forgot the keys to mr. tom &apos;s casa .
could you let me in , por favor ?
there &apos;s no mr. tom here . you have the wrong apartment .
no .
i am doing the cleaning for mr. tom .
wow . impersonating a maid stereotype .
pathetic much ?
oh , chloe , look ,
i know your mother and my husband are leaving for paris .
i just need to talk to tom for five minutes
before they head to the airport .
they left an hour ago .
who &apos;s there ?
i got it , ms. schoenfield .
this is ms. schoenfield .
do you know what flight they &apos;re taking ?
it &apos;s really important i talk with tom .
he &apos;s not picking up his phone .
jeez , stalk much ?
come on . come on . i &apos;m not a stalker .
seriously ? my mom told me you were hiding under his bed
while they were in it .
so i &apos;m certainly not going to help you
sabotage her trip to paris .
listen to me . something happened yesterday .
and i can &apos;t go into it , but tom needs to be here--
not for me , for the kids .
please . please .
fine .
i &apos;ve got their flight information upstairs .
thank you .
it &apos;s clear jimmy feels conflicted
about whether or not he belongs in rehab ,
but his loved ones--
all of you in this room--
are here because you care deeply about helping him .
so let &apos;s start by sharing with jimmy
the ways his drinking has impacted your lives .
mrs. manzani , go ahead .
well , actually , can i go first ?
i have somewhere i need to be .
who are you ?
i thought you worked here .
no . no . no . i am ...
his girlfriend .
ex @-@ girlfriend , you know , since all the problems started .
girlfriend ?
another thing you didn &apos;t tell us about .
she &apos;s not my girlfriend .
i never seen her before .
yeah . that &apos;s the problem right there .
you know , how can you have a relationship
when your boyfriend drinks and doesn &apos;t even remember you ?
why are you wearing a wedding ring ?
&apos;cause i moved on .
that &apos;s right , jimmy . you had to hear it .
i seriously had you for a girlfriend ?
you are smoking hot .
yeah , i am .
oh , my god . i do have a problem .
i was with someone like you . i don &apos;t even remember it .
mom , pop ,
i want to get better .
oh , jimmy !
that &apos;s the spirit , jimmy !
now there &apos;s a lot of people in here just like you
who can help you ,
like , uh , like jason hurwitz
and peter morton and carlos solis , room 247 .
okay . good luck .
gaby , what are you doing here ?
are the kids okay ?
yeah , the kids are fine . i just needed to talk to you .
what &apos;s this ? you don &apos;t lift a finger at home ,
but here you vacuum ?
this is my group task .
recovery here is based on two core principles--
responsibility and total honesty .
okay . great .
come in here . i need to talk to you about a lie .
so when chuck asks what made you start drinking--
and i &apos;m guessing he will--
say you cheated on me .
with who ?
it doesn &apos;t matter .
someone ugly . don &apos;t go overboard .
chuck saw susan &apos;s paintings ,
he &apos;s questioned each of you ,
and you think this one lie is going to throw him off ?
he &apos;s got nothing else .
gaby , let me tell you something about cops .
what you think he knows
is about one @-@ tenth of what he does know .
we have got to stop this guy .
god , this is a hell of a time for me to be stuck in here .
no , honey . hey , hey , it &apos;s gonna be fine , okay ?
you just focus on getting better .
i &apos;ll try .
okay , well , i should get out of here before they find me .
tell the girls i miss &apos; em ?
they miss you , too .
mr. bergman , hi . uh , remember me ?
remember you ?
susan delfino , you sold five paintings
20 minutes into your first art show .
you are my prodigy .
are you here to revel in your glory ?
actually , no , uh , see ,
i &apos;m ... uh , kind of in a rough spot right now .
oh , dear . you seem a bit agitated .
you &apos;re not considering jumping off a bridge , are you ?
but if you are , could you please leave behind
a large body of work for me to sell ?
no . uh , it &apos;s just , um ...
i need the money from my paintings , please .
oh . i just started on the paperwork .
you should receive a check in uh , four to six weeks .
oh , no , no , no . i @-@ i need it now .
i , um ...
have to get out of town for a while .
my housewife just got even more interesting .
are you a junkie ?
gambler ?
are you on the run from the mob ?
i can &apos;t tell you what it is .
i just really need that money .
well , , here &apos;s the thing--
um , i am having a teensy bit of a cash @-@ flow problem .
but i assure you ,
eight to ten weeks--
i thought you said four to six .
okay , not so teensy .
mr. bergman , i wouldn &apos;t ask
if it wasn &apos;t really important .
no , i will see what i can do ,
but no promises ...
my mysterious little housewife .
that &apos;s nice .
what &apos;s that for ?
oh , you were right . a hug should be for something ,
like the one i saw you giving bree this morning .
what was that for ?
oh , renee .
that was nothing .
oh , so you &apos;re just going door @-@ to @-@ door giving hugs ?
what , is that an australian thing ?
look , there is nothing between me and bree .
she &apos;s just going through something right now .
i was a shoulder to cry on .
oh , as long as that shoulder isn &apos;t a gateway body part .
oh , i &apos;m sorry to interrupt . i only need a minute .
i just have to ask you
a couple questions about your girlfriend .
so ask me .
i &apos;m standing right here .
not you . bree .
funny .
we were just talking about your girlfriend bree .
good @-@ bye .
renee ...
why the hell would you do that for ?
i don &apos;t know .
just trying to make your life miserable .
oh , and i got more .
i &apos;m tracking down a missing person .
it turns out his last phone signal
came from somewhere on your construction site .
i don &apos;t know anything about that .
doesn &apos;t matter . still a great reason to shut you down .
how long ?
two weeks . maybe a month . i don &apos;t know .
oh , let me guess--
as long as it takes for me to lose my investment , yeah ?
that sounds about right .
you &apos;re not getting on that property without a warrant .
oh , jeez .
where would a detective get one of those ?
see you monday .
oh , my god . this tastes so good .
i know . it reminds me of the first time
lynette and i ever flew first class .
we had been so used to traveling coach--
tom ?
yeah ?
please don &apos;t take this the wrong way , but ...
you &apos;re on a romantic trip with your girlfriend .
do you think it could just stay the two of us ?
i &apos;m sorry .
old habits .
that is the last time you &apos;ll hear of lynette .
to paris ...
ma cheri .
good . stay close with that mop .
flight 502 to paris will
be boarding in five minutes .
i &apos;m gonna run to the men &apos;s room . it &apos;s a long flight ,
and airplane bathrooms freak me out .
well , there goes one fantasy .
hey , lynette .
what the hell are you doing here ?
i need to talk to you .
i can &apos;t believe you .
you think i want to chase you down in an airport men &apos;s room ?
now listen to me .
i can only breathe through my mouth for a few minutes .
well , you can save your breath ,
&apos;cause i am going--
i am going to paris with jane ,
and i &apos;m sorry if you &apos;re having a hard time with it .
this isn &apos;t about you and jane . look . see ? good with it . okay ?
okay , good . then--then why are you here ?
because you can &apos;t go to paris , not now .
okay , i &apos;m confused .
you don &apos;t care if i go to paris with jane ,
but you &apos;re telling me i can &apos;t go to paris with jane .
i &apos;m sorry . i have to tell you something ,
but it &apos;s just really hard to say--
i &apos;m sorry , but my plane is boarding .
i have to go .
i &apos;m an accessory to murder .
here . let me help you with this .
i think you &apos;ve helped enough .
gaby , please . i can &apos;t stand this anymore .
can &apos;t we talk for a minute ?
to be honest ,
after what chuck put me through ,
i &apos;m kind of talked out .
wait . what do you mean ?
he interrogated us-- me , lynette , and susan .
he called us down to the station and grilled us one by one .
why didn &apos;t he call me down there ?
good question , given this whole thing is about you .
what are you talking about ?
bree , he wants revenge . he wants to bring you down ,
and we &apos;re all gonna go down with you .
gaby , please .
i will figure out a way to make things better .
no , you won &apos;t .
this isn &apos;t gonna stop until chuck is stopped .
say something .
why didn &apos;t you tell me this ?
i wanted to , a hundred times , but we weren &apos;t together anymore ,
and it seemed wrong to drag you into it .
tom ?
plane &apos;s boarding .
you &apos;ve got to be kidding me .
jane , i &apos;m sorry . i know what this must look like .
really ?
you know what it looks like to walk into a men &apos;s room
and find your boyfriend &apos;s ex chatting him up
before your flight to paris ?
it &apos;s not like that .
of course not . i &apos;m the crazy one .
you two rendezvousing in an airport toilet ?
i &apos;m the nut job . she &apos;s hiding under your bed .
jane &apos;s the one who needs to be sedated .
tom , i really can &apos;t deal with this right now . can we just go ?
you are not doing this to me right now .
we will go at the end of this month .
i promise .
jane . jane , it &apos;s really not tom &apos;s fault .
tom ...
honey ...
you know what she &apos;s doing , right ?
you give in here , now ,
it &apos;ll never stop .
i am so sorry .
it--but ...
there are extenuating circumstances .
okay .
then tell me .
tell me what they are .
i think i at least deserve that .
okay .
i &apos;m going to paris ,
and if you want , you can meet me there .
i &apos;m so sorry .
lynette , don &apos;t .
just ...
don &apos;t talk .
oh , my god ! you brought it .
now before i give it to you ...
oh , well , that never works .
what i was going to say ...
i have a little proposition for you .
oh , calm down . it &apos;s not sex .
dang it .
i believe you have that certain something
that makes a great artist .
maybe it &apos;s talent .
maybe it &apos;s mental illness .
all i heard was &quot; great artist . &quot; keep going .
fairview is not the fertile ground required for you to grow .
i think we need to move your skinny little tush to new york city .
move ? uh , no .
i just need to get away for a few weeks .
i &apos;ll set you up in an apartment .
you paint .
i &apos;ll take 50 % of whatever i sell ,
but let &apos;s not get bogged down in how the sausage gets made .
what about my family ?
my son is in the middle of third grade .
new york has the best private schools in the world .
he can wear a little blazer to school .
heck , if he can fit into a child &apos;s medium ,
i can loan him one of mine .
i never really thought about moving before .
well , what is keeping you here ?
yeah , not much .
okay . think it over .
but if you turn me down , then i &apos;ll know ...
it &apos;s mental illness .
i want to offer you a deal .
a deal ?
really ?
terms ?
whatever i &apos;ve done--
or whatever it is you think i &apos;ve done--
you ... write it up , and i &apos;ll sign a confession .
in exchange for ...
you leave my friends out of it .
oh , darn .
i was actually interested there for a minute .
what do you hope to gain by harassing my friends ?
what do you want ?
this .
you in pain .
you see ,
i could never figure out a way to hurt you the way you hurt me .
if you had any idea how much i &apos;m hurting already--
it &apos;s not enough . you know why ?
because you &apos;re too resilient .
husbands die , kids leave , businesses collapse ,
and bree always bounces back .
but threaten her friends ?
please .
you &apos;re talking about the people i love .
they &apos;re my whole world . i have nothing else .
you have nothing else ?
that &apos;s a bad position to make a deal from .
sorry .
hey , you remember that deal i wanted to make with you ?
you marry me and i take care of you the rest of your life ?
maybe you should &apos;ve taken it .
hey . you &apos;re old and pretty much housebound .
have you noticed if ben &apos;s been &quot; entertaining &quot; a lot lately ?
this is what i get for not having a pit bull .
i think he &apos;s cheating on me .
ben ? no , he--he seems like a great guy .
my ex was a great guy , too .
ask any stripper in new york city .
oh , my god ! i cannot go through that again .
i @-@ i just can &apos;t .
renee , i may not be your biggest fan or ...
even like you ,
but there &apos;s one thing no one can argue with--
you are hot .
pardon ?
look at you .
you &apos;re a knockout--
those gams , those curves , that killer smile .
basically you &apos;re me 35 years ago .
so this is my future ?
the point is ,
whoever this woman is , she can &apos;t hold a candle to you .
oh , thank you , karen .
now go out there and fight for your man .
you &apos;re right . tonight i will throw on a little nothing
and make a house call .
thattagirl .
you know what ?
i wish i had known you 35 years ago .
we would &apos;ve made a hell of a team .
hey , we still can
if the aussie &apos;s into it .
stop packing . we &apos;re not moving .
don &apos;t you see how great this is ?
living in new york , getting paid to paint--
it &apos;s an amazing opportunity .
to uproot our family
and move somewhere we &apos;ve never lived before ?
so we &apos;ll go for a few weeks and see how we like it .
susan , you do know that if chuck wants to take you down ,
moving to new york &apos;s not gonna stop him .
i know that .
well , then why would you want to give up the life we have here ,
after all this time ?
because it &apos;s different .
before , all i had to do was look out that window
and i &apos;d see a true friend--
someone who would do anything for me or my family ,
but now ...
it &apos;s all gone .
you think you &apos;re gonna find that somewhere else ?
you &apos;re just running .
okay . so i &apos;m running .
mike , if i get caught , i could go away for a lot of years .
so in the meantime ,
why not try to live the life i &apos;ve dreamed of ?
it &apos;s not my dream .
and if this is something that you need to do ,
you &apos;re on your own .
hello , gaby .
celia , get back here !
is this a bad time ?
give me that now ! celia !
i have 2 daughters under 13 .
it &apos;s always a bad time .
yeah , why don &apos;t you just step outside here for a second ?
so did you talk to carlos ?
he &apos;s obviously ashamed of his affair . the whoremonger .
but at least he &apos;s honest about it .
no . i wound up taking a different angle on the investigation .
actually , you were the reason for that .
me ? what do you mean ?
do you remember when we were talking about this guy ?
vaguely .
i remember it vividly ,
&apos;cause it was the oddest thing--
you see , when susan saw this picture , she nearly passed out .
and when lynette saw it ,
she willed herself into not reacting .
but you ...
you smirked .
that &apos;s crazy . why would i do that ?
same question i asked myself .
so i started doing some digging into your background .
turns out ,
ramon sanchez , formerly of oklahoma ,
is actually ...
alejandro perez ...
your stepfather .
and you never mentioned that .
oh , come on , chuck . you can &apos;t even see who--
at this point , i don &apos;t think you should say anything
without a lawyer present .
wait . am i under arrest ?
not yet .
but based on this ,
i have to start an official case file .
i &apos;m gonna need you to come down to headquarters
for an interview . be there tomorrow at 10 : 00 .
and , gaby , if you don &apos;t ...
i &apos;ll send a squad car to get you .
hi . i need to speak with carlos solis immediately .
i &apos;m sorry , but mr. solis ...
yeah , i know .
i know you have that annoying no @-@ contact policy ,
but this is an emergency .
mr. solis isn &apos;t here .
he checked himself out two hours ago .
what ? why didn &apos;t you stop him ?
he was not in a mood to be stopped .
ben , are you in there ?
i &apos;m wearing leather and i &apos;m getting cold .
ben ?
bree , no need to call me back .
just wanted to let you know that
my unofficial investigation &apos;s about to go official .
be at the station tomorrow morning at 10 : 00 .
bring a lawyer .
just when my friends needed each other most ,
they found themselves utterly alone--
one with the frantic need to find her husband ...
one with the consequences of revealing a painful secret ...
and one with the feeling that she simply no longer belonged .
but for one of my friends ,
the sense of isolation was so complete ...
here you go .
there might be no escaping it .
continental breakfast runs till 10 : 30,
but the good stuff &apos;s gone by 8 : 00 .
oh , i don &apos;t think i &apos;ll be having breakfast . thank you .
suit yourself .
do you remember how wonderful things used to be on the lane ?
i had the perfect life .
doctor husband ...
two beautiful children ...
oh , and such dear friends .
what happened ?
how did i lose it all ?
things change , bree .
i &apos;m so unhappy .
are you happy now ?
