diane called .
she wants to meet tomorrow for breakfast to talk over terms .
great . what time ?
no , i didn &apos;t say that we would meet .
she wants to bring us $ 38 million in business .
i don &apos;t see the downside .
losing our culture ,
co @-@ opting ourselves
by becoming lockhart , florrick &amp; agos .
so , we &apos;ll have the breakfast ,
and then we &apos;ll decide if we want to be co @-@ opted , okay ?
i &apos;ll call her , set it up .

i am finishing up a case .
i feel like celebrating .

no , thank you .
kalinda .
i &apos;m meeting somebody .

somebody .
a guy .
okay .
i can take you both on . where are you ?
good night , sophia .
come on ! i &apos;m lonely .
and horny .
yeah . good luck with that .
i was supposed to meet someone , can i just ...

oh , sure . i &apos;ll pull right over .
yeah , you want some ice cream ?
still want to meet up ?
i think i &apos;m gonna be sick .
hello ?
detective ?
i haven &apos;t been given my call , yet .
i know my rights . i &apos;ve been here six hours ,
and i haven &apos;t gotten my call .
thank you .
seriously ?
look , i have a sixth amendment right
to be informed of the charges against me .
i have the right to an attorney .
you know who has the hardest time getting arrested ?
lawyers . you know why ?
because we know our rights .
no .
you think you &apos;re at the four seasons .
you asked for your sixth amendment rights , it &apos;ll come ,
just not right away . the kitchen &apos;s a little busy .
might take a little while .
in the meantime , be patient .
we &apos;ll get to you .
this is harassment .
no , it &apos;s worse .
it &apos;s inefficiency .
should we do this another time ?
no , let &apos;s start .
i &apos;ll fill cary in when he gets here .
i have 45 clients i intend to bring to florrick @-@ agos .
i lose 12 to lockhart / gardner .
won &apos;t canning and david lee come after the rest ?
not if i don &apos;t tell them i &apos;m leaving .
that sounds familiar .
but i have demands first .
kalinda .
she needs to come with me .
we have robyn .
kalinda &apos;s better .
it &apos;s a deal @-@ breaker .
i have to talk to cary .
they have a certain ...
relationship that might prove difficult .
if the answer is no , then i need to know right away .
i &apos;ll let you know by the end of the day .
good .
here &apos;s the big one .
i expect an equal vote with cary and you .
you can still out @-@ vote me two @-@ to @-@ one ,
but i bring with me prestige .
and 38 million .
i expect an equal vote .
i can &apos;t decide that on my own . it &apos;ll matter to cary .
like this meeting mattered to him ?
alicia ,
we have a chance to make this the largest firm
in the country run by women .
think about it .
cary , look , if you &apos;re not interested in our future ,
just let me know , okay ?
and i &apos;ll start making decisions on my own .
call me by 3 : 00,
or i am gathering the partners together for a vote .
i was awake .
okay ?
you were asleep ,
and i heard what the charge was against you .
you did ? what ?
drugs .
okay , on your feet . let &apos;s go .
let &apos;s see here .
did you guys get any breakfast ?
what the hell did he just say ?
what ?
what the hell did he just say about where to walk ?
i have no idea ...
you stay to the right , jackass !
that side is for the people ,
this side is for the scum . do you understand me ?
just do what i do .
let me see your hands .
it &apos;s kind of dark in there .
inside .
hands .
walk .
where &apos;s cary ?
breakfast with you , i thought .
he didn &apos;t make it .
i &apos;ll try him at home .
i know you .
i didn &apos;t do anything .
this is my space .
no , no , no , no . wait , wait , wait .
you &apos;re a lockhart / gardner client now .
what ? no . what ?
look , do you want to make $ 100 ?
$ 150 cash bond , payable on release .
let &apos;s go , let &apos;s boogie .
i hate this . why am i doing this ?
look , he &apos;s the son of a top client .
canning couldn &apos;t make it .
here he comes .
david howell .
mail fraud , third offense .
dear god . i can understand the second time .
but the third time , you &apos;d think he &apos;d catch on .
david !
how are you ? i &apos;m david lee ,
i represent your family law business , but ...
i &apos;m supposed to give you a message .
i &apos;ve been asked to handle your bond hearing .
there @-@ there &apos;s a lawyer in lockup that
it really should be a simple matter .
wants me to give you a message .
look , only one of us can talk at a time , david !
what lawyer ?
well , wait .
uh , it starts with a c
uh , craig ?
lanz .
lanz .
uh , no .
no . vargas .
uh , no . it &apos;s something .
uh , he &apos;s a lawyer , and he &apos;s in lockup .
but he-- but he works for another firm .
cary .
agos ?
is that the name of the lawyer ?
no , lanz .
cary lanz .
is cary there , alicia ?
no , he &apos;s not . why ?
is there any chance he was arrested ?
asa polmar ?
finn , it &apos;s alicia . i need your help .
why ? what &apos;s wrong ?
there &apos;s a chance my partner is in central holding .
all right , let &apos;s go . who &apos;s next ?
thanks for doing this , finn .
alicia , no problem .
but , ah , i don &apos;t think you &apos;re gonna want to thank me .
why ?
i just found out i &apos;m the asa .
on cary &apos;s case ?
yeah .
across from me ?
yeah .
well , this should prove interesting .
yeah .
oh , thank god .
how did you know ?
kalinda .
good . okay .
it &apos;s a drug arrest .
that &apos;s all i know .
but the last time i used drugs
was the mushrooms four years ago .
do you have enough for bail ?
i pooled the partners .
i have $ 500 cash . first offense , no flight risk .
it shouldn &apos;t be a problem .
cary agos .
no matter what , i talk .
well , i see we &apos;re enjoying a visit from a special asa .
is this some sort of a vip engagement ?
this is not just another routine arrest , your honor .
mr. cary agos is accused of a super x felony .
and is ...
what ?
it is a non @-@ probationable offense
with a minimum sentence of 15 years .
my goodness . smack or crack ?
heroin , your honor .
how many grams ?
900 grams .
are-- you &apos;re kidding .
and we ask that court assign bail
in excess of $ 1.3 million .
... assign bail in excess of $ 1.3 million dollars .
i imagine you &apos;d like bail set
at an amount lower than the asa requested .
yes , your honor .
clearly , the state &apos;s attorney is overreaching .
how i wish i were , your honor ,
but , in illinois ,
bail is tied with the street value of the controlled substance .
now , on or about may 25 of this year ,
mr. cary agos conspired to transport
and sell $ 1.3 million in ...
your honor , mr. agos has a clean record .
he has major ties in the community ,
and he is as far from a flight risk as it &apos;s possible to be .
and he was an asa .
therefore , he &apos;s subject to retribution in jail .
and yet his incentive to flee
is directly tied to the harshness of the sentencing guidelines .
i , therefore , will match bail to street value .
your honor , i will be filing a motion to reconsider .
when you file , i will do just that .
bail is set at $ 1.3 million ,
to be posted at a hundred percent .
we will reconvene for a preliminary hearing in two weeks &apos; time .
i &apos;ll gather the partners for bail .
this has to be about bishop .
were you with him on may 25 ?
i never heard about any drug transport .
they &apos;re going after your legal advice ,
trying to suggest that you told him how to break the law .
you need to get to bishop before he hears about my arrest .
he might think i &apos;ll flip .
i &apos;m on it !
i &apos;m on my way to see you now , mr. bishop .
if you could just give me ten minutes .
regarding ?
i &apos;d rather not say on the phone .
you know it &apos;s important , if i &apos;m calling you like this .
i &apos;m picking up dylan from school .
i @-@ i &apos;ll meet you there !
see you in ten minutes .
hello , florrick @-@ agos .
robyn , i need you to get the partners together .
i &apos;ll be in in an hour .
okay , is this about the diane vote ?
no .
and could you find out how much the firm can borrow ?
what do you mean ? like , for maintenance ?
we have a $ 600,000 line of credit .
no , cary was arrested last night .
it &apos;s for his bail .
oh , my god .
how much is bail ?
i need you to keep this between us , robyn ...
we need to raise $ 1.3 million .
that &apos;s my call @-@ waiting .
$ 1.3 mill ...
yes , and there are no bail bondsmen in illinois ,
so , we have to do this on our own . i &apos;ve got to go .
this is alicia .
okay , i &apos;ve slept on it ,
and i &apos;d like your permission to poll on your campaign .
eli .
no , there is no campaign .
i know . that &apos;s why we have to poll .
eli , this is not the best time . i have to go and meet ...
look , you &apos;re not obligated to act on ...
eli , i &apos;m hanging up . no polling .
it won &apos;t cost you anyth ...
i liked your old office better .
this is more like a dentist office .
we &apos;re saving money .
i thought chicago was corrupt .
can &apos;t you just steal more ?
don &apos;t you have something else to do today ?
i told you i was fired .
from the agency ?
the juice bar .
what are you doing now ?
i &apos;m looking out the door .
why ?
i &apos;m surveying the troops .
is it about the intern not wearing panties ?
what ?
the intern not wearing panties .
is that why you &apos;re worried ?
which intern is not wearing panties ?
her .
bertha ? she &apos;s a grandmother .
no , behind her .
oh , dear god . how do you know she &apos;s not wearing any panties ?
i heard the guys talking .
maybe he &apos;s telling her she has to put on panties .
really ? i have to wear panties
in the governor &apos;s office ? are you sure ?
for decorum &apos;s sake , yes . if it were up to me ,
you could wear what you wanted .
don &apos;t say anything . this is not the time to be funny .
eli , i need to talk to you .
hello .
hi .
this is my daughter , marissa .
marissa , what a pleasure .
peter .
nice to meet you .
i voted for you .
absentee ballot in israel .
she spent two years with the idf .
that &apos;s impressive .
i &apos;m gonna steal your dad for just a second .
you asked alicia to run ?
what ?
my wife , alicia florrick .
you asked her to run for state &apos;s attorney .
jackie overheard you .
okay , peter . here &apos;s the thing .
i ...
no .
she &apos;s my wife .
yeah .
and she can win .
it &apos;s not your job to be doing ...
it is my job , peter .
why do you think i &apos;m fighting so hard
to get a friendly face in the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s office ?
because you have problems there .
because someone could ...
dig up old skeletons .
all right .
find another friendly face .
it &apos;s not going to be my wife .
end of story .
thank you for seeing me , mr. bishop .
i &apos;ll make this fast .
cary agos was arrested .
who &apos;s he ?
my partner , your other lawyer .
oh , the kid . right .
we wanted you to hear it from us first .
they &apos;re saying that he helped transport $ 1.3 million
in heroin on may 25 .
we want you to know that we are handling this .
what &apos;s that mean ?
we &apos;re putting together his bail ,
and i &apos;m representing him .
what &apos;s his bail ?
$ 1.3 million .
again , i want you to know
that attorney @-@ client privilege covers
all his dealings with you .
not illegal dealings .
it &apos;s my considered opinion
there were no illegal dealings .
also , cary would never make a deal with the state &apos;s attorney .
ever .
they &apos;re using him to get to me .
that &apos;s why the bail amount .
yes .
and we &apos;re handling this .
cary will not turn on you , mr. bishop .
believe me .
okay .
keep me posted .
dylan !
over here !
if anyone has any drugs ,
or anything , in any orifice ,
now &apos;s the time to tell me .
shoes held by the toes , pull out your insoles . now !
let &apos;s go , let &apos;s go !
now , bang those shoes together .
drop your shoes ,
hold your arms out .
put your palms facing the ceiling .
do not--
i repeat , do not smudge this ,
or you will have my full attention .
cary agos .
let &apos;s go .
this is your new home .
this is where you will live .
i am your landlord .
don &apos;t make me angry .
number five .
hey . five minutes .
you stood me up .
yes .
between having a drink with you or spending a night in jail .
so , the charge said , on or about may 25th ?
what happened on may 25 ?
you working this ?
you want me working this ?
thank you .
we don &apos;t have time to gush . okay ?
what happened ?
we were worried about losing clients ...
cary , lean in .
we were worried about losing clients ,
so i met with bishop to see if he was happy .
that was on may 25 .
bishop alone ?
no . in his kitchen ,
while i was waiting before , there were three crew members .
you remember any of their names ?
no , i don &apos;t @-@ i don &apos;t think they said their names .
they just ...
one had silver teeth . top row .
okay .
what did you tell them ?
nothing illegal .
you know the charge says that
you told them how to elude arrest
in the next drug shipment .
i didn &apos;t .
okay , but is there any way that
whatever you said could have been misconstrued ?
not reasonably .
show me your arm .
c @-@ block . 8 @-@ 6 @-@ 9 ... ?
that &apos;s five .
any advice ?
yeah .
find a friend .
thank you .
you &apos;re kidding , right ?
you &apos;re retiring ?
yes , at the end of the month .
i want to keep the general managership until then .
after that , you can have it .
diane ...
is retiring .
what ? why ?
you &apos;re kidding .
you &apos;re forcing me out .
i &apos;m sick of fighting .
yes , but not so you &apos;d retire .
where are you going ?
nowhere .
she is retiring .
oh . well , i &apos;m sorry to hear it .
well , it &apos;s time .
i want to have a life with my new husband .
you will put in a good word for us with your clients .
yes , as long as you don &apos;t chase them till i &apos;m retired .
i want this to be a dignified exit .
oh , uh ... absolutely .
you believe her ?
that she &apos;s retiring ?
i don &apos;t know .
where would she go ?
i thought diane was retiring .
she is retiring-- from lockhart / gardner ,
and coming here to us .
wh @-@ why didn &apos;t she tell us ? she &apos;s our lawyer .
yes , and due to her fiduciary responsibility to lockhart / gardner ,
she can &apos;t tell you a thing ...
... including the fact that
she wants you to follow her here ,
to her new home .
would you excuse me a second ?
we can &apos;t let cary rot in prison .
well , what about his family ? i thought his parents were rich .
i called them . they &apos;re seeing what they can pull together .
i mean , it &apos;s $ 1.3 million .
that &apos;s a lot of money ...
robyn ...
i checked with the bank , and it &apos;ll require borrowing
$ 200,000 against the firm ,
and each partner needs to put aside their yearly draw .
okay , that &apos;s ... oh ...
hey , guys ,
this is what we do . when one of us gets in trouble ,
we ... we pull together .
yeah . and cary &apos;s not a flight risk .
the money , it comes back to us .
yes , in two years , after the case has been settled .
and in the meantime , we go bankrupt .
and i need that draw to pay my rent .
i mean , i &apos;m sorry , but ...
i think you &apos;re being selfish .
okay . hey .
let &apos;s vote .
are you a lawyer ?
yeah .
do you need one ?
depends on how much you charge .
i &apos;m pretty reasonable .
what do you need ?
yeah , i was there .
you were with cary agos ?
bishop &apos;s lawyer ?
yeah .
this was on the 25th of may ?
around then .
that &apos;s when i was at bishop &apos;s house .
and this lawyer , he didn &apos;t tell you anything
about how to break the law .
is that correct ?
yeah . pretty much .
will you testify to that ?
it &apos;s for bishop , right ?
yeah .
could you make a list
of the people that were there ?
in bishop &apos;s kitchen ?
sure .
excuse me .
kalinda .
you can &apos;t do that .
do what , sir ?
talk to my guys .
not without my permission .
may i have your permission ?
no .
this is to help cary agos .
i understand that .
no .
if it helps cary , it helps you .
because cary threatens me .
no .
because cary had a private meeting
with three members of your crew ,
and suddenly he &apos;s under arrest .
someone is collaborating with the police .
if that &apos;s true ...
i &apos;ll handle it .
i &apos;m going to say this very carefully ,
so you understand .
i don &apos;t want you to pursue
this line of investigation .
do you understand ?
yeah .
good .
good talking to you .
these represent our most recent numbers
on the state &apos;s attorney race .
we focused on the top three candidates .
卡斯特罗
in a hypothetical race between the current state &apos;s attorney ,
james castro , and the governor &apos;s wife ,
alicia florrick ,
mrs. florrick would win by eight points .
margin of error ?
three points .
how many people were sampled ?
oh , just ignore her . it &apos;s my daughter .
just ignore me .
4,000 likely voters .
landlines and cell phones .
mrs. florrick is well @-@ liked among female voters ,
liberal and conservative .
that &apos;s very unusual .
older female voters liked that she stood by her husband ;
younger , that she started her own business .
you needed me , mr. gold ?
actually , nora needed to talk to you .
no , i don &apos;t .
yes , you do .
you @-@ you said you needed to ask lauren a question .
could you give us a second ?
i can &apos;t ask her . it &apos;s sexual harassment .
but asking me to ask her isn &apos;t sexual harassment ?
oh , dear god .
come on , nora .
you can bring up panties isn &apos;t in a much more efficient
and less offensive way than i can .
oh , really ?
why do you want to know what she &apos;s got going on under there ?
are you wearing panties ?
what ?
are you wearing panties ?
some of the office workers
are saying you &apos;re not wearing panties .
does that answer your question ?
bonita , i need you to do another poll
this one about the governor .
personal or professional ?
personal .
your son could stay in prison for a year , sir .
a full year , awaiting trial ...
okay .
yes .
thank you .
he can go as high as $ 8,000 .
you &apos;re kidding . i thought his dad was a lobbyist .
he said it &apos;s a bad time of year .
okay .
we have 100 from the firm .
eight from the family .
cary has 200 saved .
we &apos;re $ 975,000 away .
we &apos;re a million away .
no .
i have $ 15,000 in savings ,
and my parents loaned me $ 10,000 .
robyn ...
you can &apos;t .
well , of course i can .
cary would do the same for me .
we &apos;re still $ 975,000 short .
who are you calling , bishop ?
no .
hi , moira . it &apos;s alicia .
i was wondering if you had any time today .
i wanted to talk about my condo .
possibly taking out a second mortgage .
hey , it &apos;s only money .
alicia ?
judge karpman &apos;s office is calling .
you &apos;re needed in court .
that &apos;s bond court .
the judge is hearing my motion to reconsider on bail .
moira ?
i &apos;m gonna have to call you back , okay ?
thanks .
here we go again .
maybe you can raise the bail to $ 3 million this time .
why didn &apos;t i think of that ?
ah , counselors .
i understand that you wish to review
the cary agos situation .
is that right , asa polmar ?
uh , actually , your honor ,
i made a motion to reduce the bail amount ...
yes .
and your motion was denied . mr. polmar ?
yes , your honor .
mrs. florrick works as cary agos &apos;s partner ,
but she also represents lemond bishop ,
a drug dealer complicit in this matter .
so you wish to disqualify her as his representative ?
yes , your honor .
your honor ,
cary agos chose me as his lawyer
and has waived all concerns about conflict of interests ...
yes , but the court has not .
the prosecution &apos;s motion is granted .
wow , i didn &apos;t see that coming .
well , you should be honored .
i didn &apos;t want to go up against you .
is this about your sister ?
is what about my sister ?
this drug case .
is it about your sister &apos;s overdose ?
yeah , &apos; cause that &apos;s what i need is a motive
to bring down the top drug dealer in town .
cary agos isn &apos;t the top drug dealer in town .
no , but he &apos;s enabled the top drug dealer in town .
as have i.
is this gonna get in the way of a friendship , alicia ?
i hope not .
good .
i don &apos;t want it to .
neither do i.
my apologies .
okay .
i need you to represent cary .
he was arrested .
one of bishop &apos;s crew is claiming
that he told them how to avoid detection on a drug shipment .
how large was the shipment ?
$ 1.3 million in heroin .
that &apos;s not good .
uh ... wait , it &apos;s not good for cary ,
or it &apos;s not good for us ?
both .
my clients won &apos;t like to see
my new name partner under arrest .
he was arrested
because he was fighting for his client .
he puts his life on the line for them .
okay .
she &apos;s going with florrick @-@ agos .
no , too small potatoes .
ah , it fits diane &apos;s romantic soul .
then there &apos;s an opportunity .
what would that be ?
cary agos was arrested a few days ago .
a drug charge .
i , uh , i need your help , kalinda .
cary &apos;s been arrested .
i know .
it has to do with bishop .
you knew that , too .
i did .
okay , so you need to
talk to the other people in bishop &apos;s crew ,
find out who was in this meeting with cary ?
look , bishop doesn &apos;t want us to talk to any of his crew .
he wants us to defend cary in another way .
look , i have an idea ,
but i &apos;ll get back to you when i have more , okay ?
kalinda .
what ?
oh , come on , i &apos;m just giving the boys
something to fantasize about .
what &apos;s up ? what do you need me for ?
why did you call me thursday night ?
why did i call you ?
i think i made that pretty clear .
the first time in three years ,
you just decide to call me ?
yeah .
at the exact moment cary agos was being arrested ?
you &apos;re working with the police .
you knew about the arrest ,
and you knew i &apos;d get picked up , too , so you kept me occupied .
look , i didn &apos;t want you to get swept up in all that crap .
what evidence have they got against cary ?
what evidence ? why ?
is there someone undercover in bishop &apos;s crew ?
and what makes you think even if i knew i &apos;d tell you ?
because you could get into trouble with your p.i. firm
for warning me about the arrest .
really ?
mm @-@ hmm .
after i help you , keep you safe ,
out of the goodness of my heart ,
you &apos;re gonna use that against me ?
who &apos;s the c.i. in bishop &apos;s crew ?
hello .
eli .
i &apos;m surprised . how are you ?
good . good , mr. state &apos;s attorney .
i have some great news for you .
the governor has reconsidered .
he wants to endorse you .
well , that is music to my ears .
when did that happen ?
there &apos;s just one thing i need you to do for me , james .
peter &apos;s a proud man .
you &apos;ll need to ask him again .
why ?
he can &apos;t be seen reversing himself without you making some effort .
i &apos;m not going to kiss the ring again , eli .
i know , you don &apos;t have to .
i &apos;ll arrange for a meeting tomorrow afternoon .
trust me , it &apos;s just a formality .
i &apos;ll see you then .
okay . huh ?
your father &apos;s a smart man .
how &apos;d your preliminary go ?
well , i told the public defender what you said .
he said he &apos;d try it . thanks .
sometimes the law is nothing more than calling another man &apos;s bluff .
well , you could help me with something else , cary .
what ?
bishop . he wants me to cut your finger off .
i told him you were okay , i didn &apos;t need to .
you knew who your friends were .
i do .
yeah , so that &apos;s why i &apos;m here . to remind you .
i mean , you talk to the sa ,
you ask about any kind of deal ,
you &apos;re dead .
you understand ?
i do , i do . i do .
good . now @-@ now , i have to do this , all right ?
you fell down against the bars and you cut yourself .
what ?
even to your lawyer ,
that &apos;s what you say . you fell down against the bars ,
you cut yourself . you &apos;re not sure how .
just yell at guard .
what ?
it &apos;s a test , all right ? bishop wants to help you ,
but he needs to know you understand .
so , count to four ,
and yell at guard .
i @-@ i @-@ i ...
guard ...
guard !
i just fell down . it &apos;s nothing serious .
you cut yourself falling down ?
a ... against the bars . yeah .
cary , are you being intimidated ?
because we can get you transferred .
no , everything is good .
what else do you have ?
well , we want to win this in preliminary hearing ,
but we don &apos;t know what the state &apos;s attorney has .
and bail ?
we &apos;re working on it .
how much does florrick @-@ agos have ?
a portion .
ask my dad .
i hate asking him , but he might come up with the rest .
you already tried him ?
no , no .
i &apos;ll give him a call .
okay .
did the dad offer anything ?
$ 8,000 .
i &apos;ll see what i can come up with .
... a thousand registered cook county voters all considered
likely voters , castro polled better
than your three alternates-- jenlowe ,
hart and barnwright .
how much better ?
12 to 14 points .
did you try any other names ?
what ?
your wife , mr. governor .
eli , i said no .
the poll was already in the works .
i don &apos;t care . she &apos;s not running .
you don &apos;t want to hear the results ?
i can guess . she did well .
she &apos;s a brand . so what ?
she polled eight points higher than castro .
she beat him in every demographic .
we polled every political name against castro .
and she &apos;s the only one who won .
handedly .
and her favorables , bonita ?
they &apos;re at 80 % . she &apos;s the most popular name in chicago .
well , because she &apos;s not in politics .
put her in politics ,
and she becomes a politician .
people hate politicians .
bonita , would you step out for a second ?
peter , i am your chief of staff .
it is my job is to keep you from being hit
by the knowns and the unknowns .
what are the unknowns ?
your intern not wearing any panties .
you &apos;re kidding , right ?
your intern comes to work sans panties .
and lifts her dress up in the middle of work .
well , hell , eli , tell her not to .
it &apos;s lauren , peter . your intern .
the one you won &apos;t let me fire .
i told you not to fire her .
i didn &apos;t tell you to let her run around like a cat in heat .
i have no control over someone i can &apos;t fire ! someone you &apos;re ...
look , what does this he to do with alicia running ?
i did scandal polling .
dear god !
using all fictitious names .
the possibility of you surviving another sexual scandal
if alicia doesn &apos;t stand beside you .
you know what ? this is sick .
what &apos;s sick is that i &apos;m the one trying to keep alicia on board .
yes . because you &apos;re not married to her .
exactly !
castro wants to meet .
what ?
castro wants to make another case for your endorsement .
he pleaded with me for a meeting .
if we &apos;re not having alicia run ,
you should listen to him .
alicia , you have a few clients here ...
diane said that she &apos;d kick in some money for cary &apos;s bail .
we need to call her and get her ...
alicia , wait .
bishop is here .
what ? why ?
mr. bishop , hello .
uh , you should &apos;ve called .
is everything all right ?
yes . thank you .
i &apos;m here to have a general conversation about my business holdings .
okay . i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m not ...
how can i help you with that ?
actually ...
why don &apos;t i wait here while you deal
with the gentleman at your desk ?
okay .
mr. roja , hello .
how can i help you ?
yes . uh , we &apos;ve met before , mrs. florrick .
i own a string of businesses ,
which includes dry cleaners and health clubs .
yes . i know .
i ... have decided to pay your partner &apos;s bail .
you decided ?
1.5 mill .
that should cover the bail .
the bail is 1.3 .
okay , uh ...
okay ...
1.3 million .
i would suggest that you take that
to the bank and get a cashier &apos;s check .
excuse me .
just so you know .
i was here to talk over my business holdings .
i had nothing to do with mr. roja &apos;s business .
do we understand each other ?
yes .
well , why don &apos;t i let you two talk ?
so ...
you want my endorsement ?
actually i was told
that you had had a change of heart .
so , what does this do ?
peter thinks castro wants the meeting .
castro thinks peter wants the meeting .
they &apos;re both prideful and ...
i want to learn your job .
no , you don &apos;t .
i think i &apos;d be good at it .
absolutely ridiculous !
thanks a lot , eli .
everything all right , mr. governor ?
find out if alicia wants to run .
look , all i know is diane is retiring .
we just think you should know something about florrick @-@ agos .
cary agos was arrested on a drug charge .
what ?
florrick @-@ agos is an outlaw firm .
we advise you to stay with a family law firm like ...
lockhart / gardner / canning .
nice offices , kalinda .
it &apos;s very impressive .
can i have some bottled water ?
how about some ice ?
how about you tell me who the c.i. is .
i can &apos;t .
okay .
who is that ?
your boss .
i &apos;m telling him you warned me off so i wouldn &apos;t be arrested .
that &apos;d be a bitchy thing to do .
hi . can i speak to mr. redmond , please ?
if you want me to help you , hang up the phone .
i can &apos;t tell you who the c.i. is .
kalinda , you would tell bishop .
bishop would have him killed .
but there is a c.i. ?
your friend , cary ?
he &apos;s guilty .
he &apos;s going away for 20 years .
guilty of what ?
he told bishop &apos;s crew
how to avoid getting arrested for the latest shipment .
that &apos;s conspiracy .
that &apos;s according to a c.i.
a c.i. who has reason to lie .
no , it &apos;s not . it &apos;s according to this .
there &apos;s a recording .
1.3 million in bail . i should frame this .
yeah . i know . i felt the same way .
as you can see , your honor ,
as angering as the defense has found this extortionist bail ,
we have met it .
cary agos should be released .
yes . that seems clear .
unless there &apos;s anything further , asa ?
asa polmar ?
what &apos;s he doing ?
i don &apos;t know .
your honor , we object to these funds and we ...
what ? you object ?
yeah , and we ask for a source of funds hearing .
your honor , this is a delaying tactic .
we believe these funds are derived from drug sales ,
your honor , the very charge against the defendant .
you believe ? an innocent man is being held in holding .
the defendant has been charged with conspiracy to transport drugs .
we would argue that this bail money is a pay off for that action .
it is money derived from a drug dealer protecting his own .
there are so many suppositions in that argument , your honor ,
i don &apos;t even know where to begin .
well , why don &apos;t we begin with a source of funds hearing ?
excuse me ! no , no !
no , no , no ! both of you ,
step back behind the bar .
behind the bar .
given the size of this bail posting ,
i will schedule a source of funds hearing one week from today .
in the meantime , we ask that mr. agos be released , your honor .
mr. agos will remain as our guest
until we can establish that these funds did not come
from the sale of drugs .
is it from bishop ?
not specifically .
cary , we &apos;ll get you out soon !
stay safe !
stay to the right !
keep your eyes down !
eight bodies moving !
hey !
kalinda ?
hey !
what did i just tell you ?
i told you to keep your eyes down !
you understand me ? do you understand me ? !
i understand .
