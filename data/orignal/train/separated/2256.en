Daniel's grave. He died because of you.
I was very young, and your mother--
she ripped his heart out.
Henry, you're gonna go home with David.
I want you to be here because you want to be here,
not because of magic.
I want to redeem myself.
Magic can set you free. Let me guide you.
And I won't become like her?
That, dearie, is entirely up to you.
It's not safe here. Cora's still out there.
We found a safe haven. We must go there now.
Hello, Hook.
I don't know if I can do this.
I'm not a very good liar.
Oh, it's not really a lie, Aurora.
Lancelot did die an honorable death
and Cora did escape. All true.
Just leave the particulars to us.
There's no reason to cause unnecessary panic amongst your people.
I'm not so sure it's unnecessary--
Wait.
The tower. We always have sentries guarding the entrance.
Stay close.
Oh, my god.
This can't be.
Our land--we were protected here, hidden.
How did the ogres find us?
Ogres didn't do this.
What?
Cora did. Their hearts--
They were ripped out. This was her magic--twisted and evil.
We have to stop her.
Too late.
She killed them. She killed them all.
No, we have to stop her before she hurts anyone else.
Hey. Look.
There's someone under there.
He's alive.
Please.
It's okay.
Please help me.
It's okay.
You're safe now. We won't hurt you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
第五集
Thank you very much for trying. See you.
You.
We need to talk.
What the hell was that for?
Sleeping with my wife.
Kathryn?
Snow.
Look, I didn't know. All right? I was cursed.
Yeah, I got it. What do you want?
So... is it true?
People are saying that you're trying to find a way
to build a portal back to your land
because that's where you think Emma and Mary Margaret are,
that they're alive.
Well, the whispers can stop.
I have no secrets from this town.
That's exactly what I'm doing.
But the land--it's--it's gone, destroyed by the curse.
Apparently not.
Well, you're having any luck?
Not yet.
We're working on it.
Does that mean that all the lands still exist?
Possibly.
So the queen lied to us.
Again.
Are you sure?
Remember who we're talking about.
Regina.
Are you here to see me?
I've been trying to keep my promise to Henry,
but it's been difficult.
To not use magic.
It's been two days.
That's an excellent start.
Come on in.
It's just that
magic is the way I've always gotten everything.
Sounds like it's also the way you've lost everything.
Regina, this is your chance to start over,
to earn Henry.
Dr. Whale, this is highly inappropriate.
Send me back.
Excuse me?
To my land. Send me back to my brother.
Why don't you check the "Missing" board like everyone else?
Your curse only brought the living.
Well, then I'm sorry for your loss.
But I'm afraid I can't send anyone anywhere.
Can't or won't?
Dr. Whale, I have to insist. Please.
Go.
Sorry.
What you said isn't entirely true, is it?
I'm sorry?
About the curse only taking the living.
The grave of your father's here, right?
I don't care about Whale or his brother.
I brought who I wanted.
Anyone else?
If you want help, you have to try and trust me.
Stopping magic is a lot harder than starting.
Now show me what you've learned.
Immobilize it.
There. I did it.
Excellent work, my apprentice.
Now there's just one last, tiny, tiny, teeny, little detail.
Take its heart.
Like what my mother did to--
Oh, to your true love. Indeed.
Then you already know how it's done.
Gentle.
If you do it right,
no harm will befall it,
unless of course, you will it.
I can't.
It's innocent.
Nothing is innocent.
Now it belongs to me.
You see, when you take a heart,
it becomes enchanted.
Stronger than a normal heart.
You're not hurting the beast.
You're controlling it.
Now show me you know what to do with that power.
Kill it.
What?
You've seen it done. Now do it yourself.
Show me you can take the next step in your training.
Crush it.
Dearie, dearie, dearie.
And I had such high hopes.
And I didn't sign up to kill unicorns.
Magic is power.
Until you can take power,
you're not learning anything.
Do you want me to teach you or not?
Yes.
Then there's one simple question for you to ponder.
I'll tell you anything.
I don't need the answer. You do.
What's holding you back?
His name was Daniel.
I preserved his body with an enchantment spell.
He's dead, but frozen,
and I've kept him in my family mausoleum.
Because you couldn't let go of him.
If you can't let go of the past, Regina,
it's doomed to haunt you.
You know what?
I think this has been quite enough.
Regina, wait. I-I can help you.
I doubt it.
Daniel?
All right.
Come on.
What's with the yawn?
This isn't school. It should be fun.
I couldn't sleep.
I know.
I miss 'em, too.
Now just think how happy Emma and Snow will be
when they come home to find that you've become a proper knight.
Say hello to your steed.
Is he mine?
This one's yours.
Really?
So... How do I get on him?
Oh, you're not riding today.
I'm not?
No. There's much to learn before you hop in the saddle.
Like what?
Well, every morning,
you'll have to muck out his stall.
Then you'll brush him and feed him.
After school, you'll do it again.
Every day, twice a day.
That's not riding. That's babysitting.
Ah. Horsesitting.
It builds an essential bond--
the trust between knight and steed.
Okay. But when will I ride him?
When the horse tells you.
I'm gonna go check in on the dwarves, see how the mining's coming.
I'll pick you up later.
So...
Anything you wanna tell me?
Are you ready to begin?
Oh, I've been ready.
The question is, are you?
Yes, I am.
Tell me why you're really here.
For power--
Stop wasting my time!
What is it you want? Come on.
You've done all your soul-searching.
Now tell me.
Can you teach me
how to use magic to bring back the dead?
That's what this is about? The stable boy?
I want true happiness.
Then find it elsewhere, dearie.
Magic can do much, but not that.
Dead is dead.
Then I am lost.
And I've had my time wasted.
I'm sorry, but, uh,
transcending death is beyond even my reach.
I thought nothing was beyond your reach.
Busy. Should I--
No. No.
Nothing important going on here.
Rumplestiltskin--
Ignore her.
I got what you wanted.
What about the slippers?
Oh. Couldn't find 'em.
Heard talk they've already been moved to another land.
That's what I needed to get to that other land.
Well, come with me in my hat.
I'm sure we can work something out.
No, no. Your hat only transports between magical realms.
I need to get to a land without magic.
Why would anyone want that?
My business.
You want the ball or not?
Yes.
Help yourself to as much gold as you deem appropriate.
Oh, and, you.
You can let yourself out. Our work is done.
Wait. So that's it?
You're not going to teach me anymore?
So long as you harbor foolish notions
of bringing back the dead,
so long as you live in the past,
you'll never find your future.
Teaching you is a waste of time.
Pardon me... for eavesdropping,
but I think you need to look elsewhere for assistance.
What do you know about it?
I hear things.
Jefferson's the name,
and I'm a man who travels and sees much,
and I know the man who can do what you want--
bring back the dead.
He's, um, you might say...
a wizard.
I can bring him to you.
At what price?
Always a price indeed. So here's mine.
Like I said, I'm a man of travels,
and I've made many enemies along the way,
and I'd like a royal passport
so I can have free reign to traverse your kingdom.
How would I do that?
Well, you're the queen... aren't you?
That's right. I am.
And this wizard...
Can he really bring someone back from the dead?
Well, if he can't, no one can.
Have you seen him before?
Yes, I've seen him around. He's a blacksmith.
Came to our camp a couple months ago.
Said he lost his hand in an ogre attack.
Why would Cora leave a survivor?
It's messy. Doesn't make sense.
You think he's lying?
I think Cora's tricked us before.
I don't want that to happen again.
Here you go.
I can't thank you enough for your kindness.
Fortune, it seems, has seen fit to show me favor.
An island full of corpses. You're the only one to escape.
How exactly did that happen?
She attacked at night,
slaughtered everyone in one fell swoop.
When she started ripping out people's hearts,
I hid under the bodies of those who had already been killed.
Pretended to be dead myself.
Mercifully, the ruse worked.
So much for fortune favoring the brave.
It was all I could do to survive.
I'm gonna let you in on a little secret.
I'm pretty good at knowing when someone is lying to me.
I'm telling you the truth.
We should leave here
in case Cora decides to come back.
We should start searching for a new portal back to Storybrooke.
I only got about five minutes with my husband.
Not to mention, my grandson.
You have a grandson?
Long story.
Well, I know this land well. I can guide you.
You're not gonna guide us anywhere
until you tell us who you really are.
Dr. Whale?
Where are you?
Where is he--this wizard?
You promised to bring him to me.
Indeed, and off we shall go to see him,
but I warn you, be cautious.
Why?
Is he dangerous?
Not to us.
But bear in mind,
he's never been to a world like this before.
He's unfamiliar with our ways,
with our magic.
All I care about are his ways,
and if they will do what I require.
Well, there's only one way to find out.
May I present to you...
your salvation?
You're the wizard?
I prefer "Doctor,"
but you're welcome to call me whatever makes you comfortable.
Very well...
Doctor.
You understand why you've been brought here?
Of course.
Now...
show me the patient.
It's remarkable.
It's as if his last breath was drawn just moments ago.
A preservation spell.
Can you bring him back?
Perhaps.
Let's take a look.
It's wonderful.
His condition is ideal--
apart from being dead, that is.
Just how many times have you done this, doctor?
You didn't tell her?
Tell--
Tell me? Tell me what?
The procedure is experimental.
Success is yet to occur.
But if certain conditions are met, I'm optimistic.
Optimistic?
Just hear him out.
What kind of charlatan are you?
I am no such thing.
I was told the last crucial piece of the puzzle exists in this land.
What else do you need?
A heart.
It's a fragile organ,
and I need a strong one.
I've searched the far reaches of my realm
for one with the fortitude to stand the shock of my procedure.
None have survived.
But they say in your land,
there are hearts transformed by magic.
Hearts made so powerful, they glow.
That's why you've come here?
I need this for my work.
So tell me--how do you change these hearts?
How do you enchant them?
Those who practice the dark arts do it by ripping the organ
out of the living while it still beats.
And you can do this?
No.
You assured me that
this queen was some powerful sorceress.
I will not use magic for evil.
Well, if you want your fiance back,
then you're gonna have to find someone who will.
Have I wasted my time here?
No.
I know exactly who can help us.
I know where to get a heart.
Dr. Whale?
Whale.
Whale.
I know you took Daniel's body,
and you took one of my hearts.
Why?
Why?!
Did you bring him back?
I did it.
He's alive.
Yes.
I brought him back, but...
He's not Daniel.
What?
He's... He's a monster.
This...
Was my mother's.
How sweet,
but I'm not interested in heirlooms.
Oh, I believe you will be.
Listen.
To a fireplace?
Just listen.
Where is that coming from?
Her vault.
Take your pick.
These are all... hearts?
My mother was a collector.
Whose hearts are these?
I have no idea.
She took so many,
caused so much pain.
It was impossible to keep track.
She was a monster.
Finally. After all this time.
It's perfect.
What's going on?
I just got a call that Dr. Whale was attacked.
You'll have to ask his doctors.
No. I am asking you.
I came here to speak with him and discovered he was hurt.
It's the truth.
What else?
What did you come here to speak with him about?
Someone from my past.
I believe he's come back.
Daniel.
His name is Daniel.
The man you were supposed to marry.
Snow told me what happened, and...
How it was her fault that he died.
Yes.
He did.
Well, then how could he be back?
Whale.
He believed he could bring him back from the grave,
and... I don't know how...
But he has.
You don't know how?
Guess.
He practices something more powerful than magic...
Or so I was told.
All he needed was a heart, and he took one of mine.
You have hearts here?
In my vault.
From our land.
Whose heart did he take?
I have no idea.
I took so many. It was impossible to keep track.
I need to go.
I have to help him.
No. Where is he?
Look what he did. He's dangerous.
Not to me.
He won't hurt anyone else, David, I promise.
You know I can't take that chance.
You have two choices, Regina.
Tell me where he is, or jail.
I think it's like when...you awoke from your coma.
He's following his final toughts
to where he last met me--
the stables.
No.
Henry.
Henry's at the stables.
Gramps says that you'll tell me when I'm ready to ride you.
So... Anytime.
Like, soon?
I already told you. I'm just a blacksmith.
Sure you are.
You don't want to talk to us?
Maybe you'll talk to the ogres while they rip you limb from limb.
Come on.
What?
You--you can't just leave me here like this!
What if he's telling the truth?
He's not.
Good for you!
You bested me.
I can count the amount of people who've done that on one hand.
That supposed to be funny?
Who are you?
Killian Jones.
But most people have taken to call me
by my more colorful moniker--
Hook.
Hook.
Check my satchel.
As in Captain Hook?
Ah, so you've heard of me.
You better hurry up. They're getting closer.
So unless you wanna be dinner, you better start talking.
Cora wanted me to gain your trust.
So I could learn everything there is to know about your Storybrooke.
She didn't want any surprises when she finally got over there.
She can't get there. We destroyed the wardrobe.
Ah, but the enchantment remains.
Cora gathered the ashes.
She's gonna use them to open up a portal.
Now if you'll kindly cut me loose.
No. We should leave him here to die
to pay for all the lives that he took.
That was Cora, not me.
Let's go.
Wait. Wait!
You need me alive.
Why?
Because we both want the same thing--
to get back to your land.
You would say anything to save yourself.
Why are we supposed to believe you now?
I arranged for transport with Cora,
but seeing how resourceful you are,
I'll offer you the same deal.
I'll help you.
If you promise to take me along.
How are you going to help us get home?
The ashes will open a portal,
but to find your land, she needs more.
There's an enchanted compass. Cora seeks it.
I'll help you obtain it before she does.
So Cora won't make it to Storybrooke,
and we'll be one step closer to getting home.
Sounds too good to be true.
There's only one way to find out.
You tell me one thing--
and whatever you say, I better believe it--
Why does Captain Hook want to go to Storybrooke?
To exact revenge on the man who took my hand--
Rumplestiltskin.
You--you gotta stop. You're-- you're scaring the horses.
Are--are--are you hurt?
Can I help you?
Let me help you.
Daniel!
Let him go!
Are you okay?
Yeah.
Go. Go!
It's true.
You're really here.
It won't hold for long.
Can you cast a spell to subdue him?
No. I won't use magic on him.
What do you think you're doing?
He's a monster, Regina!
If you won't put him down, I will!
David, please!
Just let me talk to him.
It's too big of a risk. There's no telling what he'll do.
You have to at least give me a chance!
Out of the way, Regina! Now!
No! I won't let you hurt him!
He'll listen to me!
Please!
Let me talk to my fiance.
The heart, your majesty.
Thank you.
Now please, wait here.
The procedure is one I must perform alone.
What's he doing back there? Magic?
He says he wields power greater than magic.
Really?
Why won't he let us see?
In his land, there's much we don't understand,
or can't.
If he can't achieve what you seek,
Rumplestiltskin was right. It can't be done.
Well?
I'm sorry.
I failed.
The heart wasn't strong enough.
It couldn't withstand the procedure.
Daniel.
Stop.
It's me.
I love you.
Regina.
Daniel.
I can't believe it's really you.
Daniel?
Stop.
Just stop the pain.
How?
Just...
let me go.
No.
No, I won't lose you again.
Without you, I'm lost.
Daniel.
Daniel, come back to me.
Can't. Can't.
But I love you.
Then love again.
Good-bye, Daniel.
Up ahead.
We'll find the compass just over the ridge.
Do you get the feeling he's leading us exactly where Cora wants us,
that this whole thing's a trap?
It's definitely a trap.
As long as we know they're trying to play us, we can--
Stay one step ahead of them.
Exactly.
Let me guess.
The compass is up there?
Oh, yeah.
So how do we...
Get to it?
It's not the climb you need to worry about.
It's the giant at the top.
Who's this?
Ah, your replacement, of course.
I needed someone more dedicated.
Dedicated?
Now.
Where were we?
You're back.
I used magic.
Why don't you come in and tell me what happened?
Enough.
I need to be taken home.
Now I have work to do, and I believe our deal is done.
The deal isn't done until he says it's done.
Now, now.
Patience, please. Our transaction is, uh,
nearly complete.
And are you satisfied with the results?
She did seem rather... heartbroken.
She is.
She bought my failure.
You should've seen her tears.
I've seen the aftermath.
Impressive.
Now... My property.
Yeah, here it is.
You'll excuse me if I check.
It's been a pleasure doing business with you.
Oh, the pleasure was mine.
Thanks to your efforts, I've made my monster.
Now I do hope
you'll be able to make yours.
I'm not making a monster.
Sure you're not. Good luck.
If these hearts are as strong as you say, I won't need luck.
Oh, just magic.
No. What I'm going to accomplish goes far beyond magic.
And yet you need a magical heart to do it.
So small-minded.
I need my powers to transcend the limitations of your magic.
This must be quite a land you hail from
if you think your abilities are more powerful.
They are.
Care to wager?
I suspect someday you'll see it my way.
I doubt it.
Now may we go?
Careful, dearie.
Just remember,
whatever it is you traffic in, it comes with a price.
We'll see.
When they say I charge an arm and a leg,
that's meant as a figure of speech.
Put it back.
You want me to reattach your arm?
Can you do it?
Of course.
But first,
tell me why.
Because I want to use it again.
Obviously.
I meant why bring that stable boy back from the dead?
Why now?
I thought...
I thought that if I helped her,
she would return me to my world.
I want to see my brother,
to try to bring him back again.
Again?
The first time ended badly.
I need to return and try it once more.
Well, it seems that's rather beyond her abilities.
My condolences.
Now my arm.
You said you can do it.
Oh, yes.
But there's a difference between "Can" and "Will."
Name your price.
Say it.
Say what?
You know what.
You came here, not the hospital.
So say it.
I need magic.
That's all I needed to hear.
Always a pleasure doing business with you, uh, Victor.
Doctor.
You've returned.
Did you find what you were looking for?
Yes.
Look at it.
It's remarkable, isn't it?
The final piece to the puzzle.
I believe so.
Let's begin.
It's alive.
You did it.
Victor, you did it.
Yes.
I believe I have.
Welcome back, brother.
It's magic, Dr. Frankenstein.
No.
Not magic.
