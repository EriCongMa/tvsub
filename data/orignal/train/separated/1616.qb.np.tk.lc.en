we &apos;ve swept the entire school .
no sign of the stratos kid .
i burned down the warehouse ,
so they &apos;re gonna send me to jail anyway .
you just have to put the gun down .
i want to get bars on the windows ,
whatever it takes to make us safe .
today &apos;s been kind of intense , you know .
i don &apos;t want you to think
that we &apos;re like starting up something again .
maybe there &apos;s something going on with jude and taylor ?
he &apos;s just doing this &apos; cause he wants attention .
你在吗
he &apos;s not straight .
why you being such a douche ?
moms know .
how ?
i told them .
callie , they &apos;re not gonna unadopt you .
you had sex with your foster sister ?
but i &apos;m not coming home .
what are you gonna do , b ?
i &apos;m gonna live here , with cortney .
if we had told you , what would you have done ?
callie , your ... lena and i have talked a lot about everything .
and , uh , this is a really hard thing to say .
we &apos;ve made a decision .
what happened between you and brandon ,
it was an incredibly selfish thing to do .
but i ... we ...
and the lying ...
i mean , how are we supposed to get past all of that ?
i &apos;m really sorry , and ...
honey .
i know what we did was wrong ...
the point is ,
you betrayed our trust ,
and that &apos;s not something that can be repaired .
so ...
we &apos;ve decided to reverse your adoption .
we , uh ... we asked your social worker to come and get you .
she &apos;s ready . come on in .
mom ?
hello , callie .
let &apos;s get going . get your stuff . we gotta go .
you want some fruit , mariana ?
no , it &apos;s fine . i &apos;ll get some at lunch .
um , callie , we would like it
if you &apos;d stay for a second , please .
listen , uh , you know , if there are any rumors
or gossip at school ,
just to ignore it , right ?
the best way to handle stuff like this
is just to let it go , you know , rise above .
try to respond to that kind of thing
and often it &apos;ll just add fuel to the fire .
yeah , okay .
is that it ?
yeah .
how about you ?
you doing okay ?
yeah .
okay , i will be there all day if you need me .
okay , thank you .
okay ?
did you , uh ...
were you able to get any of those quotes back
from the alarm companies ?
i &apos;m still waiting to hear .
okay . just let me know , okay ? i &apos;ve got to get going .
love you .
okay .
can you just get it up and do it ?
like that ? can you do that ?
watch it . watch it .
oh , it was a close one .
sorry , this ... i ... i started this .
what &apos;s up ?
uh , eddie can &apos;t take mason this afternoon ,
so i have to call in sick , again .
i can watch him .
wait . don &apos;t you have to practice after school ?
yeah , no . but i got my keyboard there .
i can just practice after i put him down .
really ? are you sure ?
yeah .
hey , mommy , you eat it !
thank you .
look !
okay .
i &apos;ll , uh ... i &apos;ll be back home by ...
uh , back here by 5 : 00 .
it &apos;s cool . i &apos;ll just get the rest of these .
i &apos;m sorry about the mess .
bye , mason .
bye .
it &apos;s like juvie .
from now on , make sure you all give yourselves extra time
to get through security .
we don &apos;t want you to be late for first period .
don &apos;t worry . i got your back .
hey . so ... i &apos;m sorry .
i shouldn &apos;t have said that thing during the lockdown .
i was just freaked out .
it &apos;s okay .
i guess , i just didn &apos;t want to see taylor get hurt like i did ,
so , i ...
anyway , i &apos;m sorry .
thanks .
well , that was cool .
do you want to go to church with me after school ?
okay , come on up .
nice , mom . you couldn &apos;t have just told me you took the car ?
you didn &apos;t tell me you were leaving the house ,
without my permission , taking a car that doesn &apos;t belong to you .
well , now i &apos;m late ! and how am i supposed to get around ?
you &apos;re an adult . figure it out .
so what &apos;s the end game here ?
are you trying to get brandon to come back home ,
or are you trying to push him further away ?
why are you doing this ?
doing what ?
moving out , fighting with mom .
why do you think , callie ?
just come home .
why ? so mom can berate me again , treat me like a bad kid ?
no ! no , so we can deal with it .
seriously ? you &apos;re one to talk .
you &apos;re like the queen of running away .
well , i &apos;m not running away , am i ?
callie , come on .
it &apos;s ... it &apos;s ... better this way . okay ?
moms won &apos;t say it , but it &apos;s just easier on everyone .
and how are we supposed to live under the same roof , anyway ?
we lived under the same roof for a long time , brandon .
that was different .
we didn &apos;t have everyone staring at us and watching our every move .
whatever . do what you want , brandon .
i just hope you know how much you &apos;re hurting moms .
no . i &apos;m not the one who told them .
so do you only bang your brother , or , like , do i have a shot ?
callie , we understand that this is not easy .
but i have no choice here .
we have a zero tolerance policy for physical violence ,
you know that .
you &apos;re suspended . go home .
hey , you know what ? while you &apos;re there ,
why don &apos;t you try to use the time
to figure out a new senior project ,
since the last two , you know , blew up . okay ?
you know , i , uh ... i probably would &apos;ve punched him too .
sorry .
today of all days , this is the last thing i needed .
are you at all worried with her being home alone ?
well , you know , i wouldn &apos;t be if we had an alarm .
for me , the worst part was when it got quiet .
you know ? i was , like , so scared .
that &apos;s understandable . i would &apos;ve been scared too .
anyone else want to talk ?
is it true ?
nick showed up at your house with a gun ?
yeah .
&apos;cause you were cheating on him .
well , no . he ... he was gonna hurt himself .
i ... you know , i had to talk him out of it .
um , you &apos;re the reason he flipped out ,
so don &apos;t go acting like you &apos;re some kind of hero .
whoa . you weren &apos;t even there , so you don &apos;t know what happened .
okay ? so why don &apos;t you shut the hell up .
you can &apos;t just sit there and point fingers at my sister
for something she didn &apos;t do .
this is not productive . okay ? let &apos;s all calm down .
we &apos;re not here to assign blame .
that was really cool of you ,
standing up for your sister like that .
so what are you doing after school ?
whoa . i &apos;m ... i &apos;m confused .
when i said i didn &apos;t want to date ,
i didn &apos;t mean that i didn &apos;t want to be friends .
well , i don &apos;t usually make out with my friends .
how about friends with benefits ?
would you be interested in that ?
let me ask my friend ?
yeah . yeah , we &apos;re fine with that .
hey .
don &apos;t .
what &apos;s up ?
just ... don &apos;t .
i &apos;ll talk to you later .
oh , sorry .
no , worries .
thank you .
yeah , of course .
法律理论与实践
law school ?
yeah . why do you sound so surprised ?
oh , nothing . i just , um ...
you seem kind of young to be in law school .
i am . i &apos;m only 19 .
it &apos;s a five @-@ year law program .
you get your bachelor &apos;s and your j.d. all at once .
cool .
what about you ? you in school ?
yeah , um ...
i ... go to nyu . i &apos;m studying photography .
oh , yeah ? what are you doing here ?
i &apos;m just in town , visiting some friends .
nice .
i &apos;m aaron ... by the way .
cameron .
nice to meet you , cameron .
i think we need to make this fencing permanent ,
and i think we &apos;re gonna need to add another metal detector ,
or getting on and off campus is gonna take forever .
whoa . how are we supposed to pay for that ?
we &apos;ve got the kilfer grant .
that &apos;s supposed to be for music , art , science ...
programs you &apos;ve been really passionate about .
i &apos;m actually more passionate about keeping kids safe .
and for the record , i &apos;ve already had multiple calls from families
who want to pull their kids out of school .
a few . sure , that &apos;s to be expected ,
but is how we want to spend what little money we have ?
excuse me .
going somewhere ?
don &apos;t worry . i &apos;m just stepping out for some air .
it &apos;s my free period .
stay there .
brandon , i &apos;m sorry that mom took the car
without talking to you about it first ,
but , you know , it does belong to the family .
yeah . i know , i know . i was gonna bring it back .
you know , she could &apos;ve just asked me .
so how are things , uh , at cout &apos;s ?
good .
yeah , it &apos;s fine . it &apos;s okay .
you &apos;re eating enough ? you &apos;re getting your homework done ?
you &apos;re practicing for juilliard ?
uh , well ... yeah ,
but ... um ...
dad had to get rid of the piano at his place
&apos;cause i wasn &apos;t using it ,
and the keyboards aren &apos;t exactly the same , so ...
i &apos;ve been playing the piano here at school .
brandon , you know you can always play the piano at home .
you think mom will be okay with that ?
she will be .
so why law school ?
um , well ...
i don &apos;t really think i wanna practice ,
but i wanna work at a non @-@ profit ...
you know , social justice , that kind of thing ...
and a law degree is super helpful .
that &apos;s cool .
yeah . i &apos;ve been interning at the juvenile justice project .
have you heard of it ?
oh , thanks .
they help minors who can &apos;t afford proper legal representation
or who were given unfair trials .
it &apos;s pretty incredible .
what about you ? i mean ,
i know you said you &apos;re studying photography ,
but is that what you ...
yeah , yeah .
that &apos;s cool .
very brave .
i &apos;m not sure i could pursue a career that was that risky .
well , it was great talking to you , cameron .
yeah , you too .
do you have an extra helmet ?
where are you taking me ?
you &apos;ll see .
wait . this is your church ?
uh , no . this is youth group .
we just , like , talk and hang out ,
and there &apos;s usually some songs or something .
it &apos;s really chill .
hey , taylor . what &apos;s up ?
hi . i &apos;m noah .
sorry . this is jude .
noah &apos;s the pastor &apos;s son .
oh , your dad &apos;s the ...
my mom , actually .
oh , cool .
jude goes to anchor beach with me .
were you guys there for the whole lockdown thing ?
i saw it on the news .
yeah , it was pretty intense .
taylor was like a total rock , though .
okay , everyone , let &apos;s do this !
oh , before i forget ,
we still need volunteers to help organize the supplies
for the rummage sale tomorrow after school . who &apos;s in ?
i &apos;m in .
sweet . thank you .
also , i &apos;m seeing a new face .
somebody want to make an introduction ?
um , this is jude . he &apos;s my friend from school .
just a friend ?
well , welcome , jude .
so , jude , what we do at these meetings is , we have a theme ,
and today &apos;s theme is trust .
we start off with a song , we read a little from the bible ,
and then we just talk about it . cool ?
uh , yeah .
all right . well , let &apos;s get started .
shawn , you want to sing us in ?
sure .
* don &apos;t forget about love around us *
* the song inside us *
* the earth below us *
* the friend beside us *
* the life between us *
* the hope close by us *
* show me how to truly see *
i , uh ... i , um ... i don &apos;t have a condom .
well , just so you know , i &apos;m on the , uh , pill .
yeah ?
yeah , so ...
so , i guess we don &apos;t need a condom .
you were with hayley , right ?
yeah .
anyone else ?
yeah , some others .
what about you ?
well , bobby ...
yeah , and ?
some others .
well , i guess , we probably should get a condom , then .
actually , that &apos;s not what i was thinking .
in the psalm of david ,
he tells us that his trust in god is why he prevailed
when he was pursued by saul and all of his armies .
so what do you think your trust in god does for you ?
well , for me , um ,
most of you guys know i got dumped this summer ,
and it hit me hard .
but what i &apos;ve realized is that
there &apos;s nothing wrong with me ,
that i didn &apos;t do anything ...
that i &apos;m not bad , you know ?
and that god &apos;s gonna send me the boyfriend i want
when the time is right .
yeah , i have no doubt about that , noah .
because trusting god means trusting yourself .
trusting that you &apos;re loved ,
lovable and perfect , just the way you are .
so , is this the kind of photography you do ?
you take a lot of selfies ?
who &apos;s taking selfies ? i &apos;m shooting you .
wait . what ?
yeah , it &apos;s like a good trick .
it &apos;s kind of the only way to catch people being themselves .
you know what i mean ?
um , i got the idea from helen levitt .
you ever heard of her ?
no .
she took these really awesome pictures of street kids ,
but they never knew that she was shooting them .
how &apos;d she do that ?
well , she had this attachment on her leica ,
which made it look like she was pointing her camera one way ,
but , actually , she was taking the photos over here .
it &apos;s cool , right ? here look .
what ?
these are ... great .
uh ... i usually hate having my picture taken .
and , well , i &apos;ve just ... never seen myself like that .
you look really handsome .
all right . so keeping with our topic .
i thought we would do a little trust exercise .
okay , everyone stand up for me .
i want you to pick a partner ,
but don &apos;t pick someone that you already know well .
hey , why don &apos;t you go with jude ?
sure .
all right , everyone get a partner ?
let &apos;s partner up . thank you .
okay . have a seat on the floor for me .
everyone have a seat . sit face @-@ to @-@ face . okay ?
legs crossed , knees touching .
might feel a little uncomfortable , but that &apos;s okay .
don &apos;t worry .
now i want you to look into each other &apos;s eyes .
and relax your hands over your partner &apos;s ,
palm @-@ to @-@ palm .
sorry .
it &apos;s okay . mine are sweaty too .
shh . no talking please .
i want you to begin to let your guard down .
trust that the person across from you ,
accepts you just as you are .
let your partner see the real you .
let that be okay .
let that be enough .
sorry , i ...
i gotta go .
jude !
why did you bring me here ?
i thought you &apos;d like it .
really ?
it didn &apos;t have anything to do with the fact that noah &apos;s gay ?
well , i saw you texting connor at the lockdown .
so ? you don &apos;t know me . okay ?
i knew you liked connor before you did .
i just thought you might like noah .
or at least you could make another friend .
i don &apos;t need any more friends .
hey , can you take a ride up there ?
will you stop up here ?
cameron , you okay ?
what is this ?
it &apos;s the house i grew up in .
oh . i didn &apos;t realize you were from here .
i guess i just thought you grew up back east .
no .
how long did you live here ?
until my mom died .
i &apos;m sorry .
how old were you ?
ten .
what about your dad ?
he ... went to jail .
he was driving the car . he was drunk .
we should go .
that &apos;s the piece you won states with .
do you remember that trip ?
when the car broke down on the five on the way up to bakersfield .
and then that guy that picked us up .
oh , my gosh !
he smelled so bad . the smell !
so bad !
that is the only time you will ever
ride in the back of a pick @-@ up truck , young man .
thank you .
for doing that .
and ...
for the millions of miles that you drove
to take me to lessons and contests and ...
everything else .
i don &apos;t say that enough .
and thank you for letting me practice here .
mama didn &apos;t tell you .
that &apos;s fine . it &apos;s fine .
you know , you can come here and
practice any time you want to , you know that , b.
stay for dinner if you like .
i can &apos;t .
sorry .
it &apos;s okay .
here is good .
so , how long you in town for ?
you want to hang out again ?
i sort of have a boyfriend .
but thank you for the day , the ride .
any time , cameron .
nice motorcycle !
who &apos;s the organ donor ?
you were riding on a motorcycle with a complete stranger .
what the hell is wrong with you , callie ?
you &apos;re supposed to be earning back our trust .
is this how you &apos;re going to accomplish that ?
do you have anything to say , young lady ?
you &apos;re hitting kids at school .
you &apos;re deliberately disobeying us .
what is going on with you ? what are you thinking ?
i don &apos;t know . what are you thinking ?
excuse me ?
no . what &apos;s going on ?
are you gonna undo my adoption ? &apos; cause if you are , just do it .
undo your ... i don &apos;t ... what are you talking about ?
i looked into it , you totally can .
callie , we would never undo your adoption .
why would you even think something like that ?
we never said anything like that .
&apos;cause you never said anything at all .
and when i asked you if you would &apos;ve gone ahead and adopted me
if you knew about me and brandon , you didn &apos;t answer and ...
oh my love .
honey , i am so sorry .
i think ...
i think we didn &apos;t know what to say ,
so we didn &apos;t say anything .
that must &apos;ve been really awful for you . i &apos;m so sorry .
callie , we &apos;re family .
we &apos;re a family forever .
look , i get it .
you know you &apos;ve been in and out of so many homes .
and i have no idea how that must &apos;ve felt .
but somehow , somehow , you &apos;ve gotta trust us ,
or trust this , that no matter how tough things get ,
that we &apos;re never going anywhere .
never .
i promise you that .
hey , where you been , love ?
church .
church ? did you know about this ?
he thinks god doesn &apos;t want him to be gay .
okay . i got this .
it was just a youth group at taylor &apos;s church .
okay .
was that her idea ?
don &apos;t worry . i &apos;m not going back .
something happen ?
nope . it &apos;s just not for me .
yeah ? you want to talk about it ?
nope .
you sure ?
yep .
dinner is ready soon .
okay .
so ...
and how was the rest of school ?
well , that &apos;s messed up .
but why do you care ?
it &apos;s not true .
yeah , it &apos;s easy for you to say .
it &apos;s never the boy that gets called a slut .
okay , maybe .
but so what ?
what , some idiot takes a cheap shot ?
like if i worried about everything people said about me ,
i &apos;d be ...
you .
did you ever get tested for ... ?
do you have something ?
what ? no .
emma wants me to .
so are you and emma back together ?
no . no , not really . i mean , we &apos;re friends .
friends don &apos;t ask friends to get tested .
i mean , we &apos;re friends with benefits .
she doesn &apos;t really want anything serious , so ...
we &apos;re kind of just , you know ...
having sex ?
yeah .
i mean , that &apos;s cool .
well , play on , player .
so , brandon was here when i got home .
oh , i forgot to tell you .
fine , fine .
i managed to be quite sweet to him .
you were ? good for you .
just wish he would come home .
i know , honey . he will when he &apos;s ready .
he &apos;s just being stubborn . i wonder where he got that from .
i don &apos;t know if it &apos;s just being stubborn .
he &apos;s got a white knight complex , has to save everyone ,
and i know he got that from me , so zip it .
his father too . poor kid , never had chance .
sometimes i think we &apos;re just
failing miserably at this whole parenting thing .
no , no , no . we are not . we are not .
we just have to find a balance , you know ,
between allowing them to make their own mistakes
and being there for them when they do .
just must be a constant source of annoyance for them .
remember how we felt about our parents when we were that age .
yeah , but my parents were monsters .
we &apos;re not like them . we &apos;re cool .
are we ? i hope so .
i &apos;m gonna go check on callie .
sweetheart , she &apos;s ...
i &apos;m gonna go check on her .
i just wanted to say good night .
my senior project , i think i know what i want to do .
oh , really ?
yeah , it &apos;s like a photo essay ,
with all the houses that jude and i were in .
so , i &apos;ll take pictures and then ,
like , write about my experiences in each house ,
so , what happened to me , what happened to jude ,
and ... how we found our way to our family .
i think that sounds great .
um , i was thinking about what you guys said ...
and i realized that ...
i think i got a lot of walls .
i think i just thought that it would stop me from getting hurt .
sorry , i , uh ... i just put him down .
you &apos;re so bad .
did you get to practice at all ?
uh , yeah , actually , i did .
i went home to my moms &apos; house , after school .
oh . good .
how &apos;d it go ?
uh , good . fine .
not my best , actually , but it just felt good to be back in it .
so , listen , i ... i ...
it &apos;s eddie .
i wanna see mason .
he &apos;s asleep . if you wanted to see him ,
you shouldn &apos;t have bailed on taking him tonight .
i &apos;ll take him now .
no , you won &apos;t .
shouldn &apos;t you be at home ? don &apos;t you have a curfew or something ?
i live here .
now get out before i call the police .
sit with me in assembly ?
sure .
hey , look . it &apos;s mariana fost @-@ whore .
it &apos;s adams fost @-@ whore .
my daughter said something really wise last night .
she said walls don &apos;t keep you safe .
she wasn &apos;t talking about anchor beach , but it got me thinking .
what kind of school do we want ?
do we want an armored fortress ?
a monument to fear ?
or do we want an open , inclusive space
where our kids can come and learn and explore and create ?
dead kids can &apos;t paint .
that &apos;s true .
but let &apos;s be honest ,
no fence is going to keep all dangers out .
me and my friends , we don &apos;t mind the fences .
&apos;cause when we come here , we just want to feel safe .
really ?
you want to feel safe ?
well , i do too .
but i can &apos;t when you and your friends are calling me names ,
saying i &apos;m a bitch and a whore .
saying that it &apos;s my fault that nick brought a gun to school ,
like i drove him to it or something .
these fences might keep us safe from what goes on on the outside .
but who &apos;s going to protect us from what &apos;s going on inside ?
the only way we &apos;re gonna keep our kids safe ...
is by being aware ...
and present , and proactive ...
by being better parents ,
we tell you kids ,
&quot; see something , say something . &quot;
and you did .
it worked .
thank you .
but how is it that school shootings have become
something to expect and prepare for ?
as a country , as a community ,
we &apos;ve accepted this as normal .
why ?
this isn &apos;t normal !
this shouldn &apos;t be normal .
we &apos;re all in this together ,
and that &apos;s the only way we &apos;re gonna get through it .
can i ask you something ?
somebody at that church say something to you
to make you feel badly about yourself ?
they didn &apos;t have to .
hey , listen to me .
you know that i &apos;m not a church person .
i believe that there is a god .
i &apos;d be willing to bet a great deal of money
that she thinks you &apos;re just as amazing
and wonderful and delicious
and squishy and adorable as i do . okay ?
i love you , boo .
okay . all right . we &apos;re at school .
sorry .
chill .
i didn &apos;t even know that
there were this many ... what do they call them ?
stis ?
i know , right ?
chlamydia is not a flower .
yeah , no kidding .
and look , hpv , hiv ,
gonorrhea , super gonorrhea , syphilis ,
and what the hell is trichomoniasis ?
hell if i know .
but at least we &apos;re all good .
yeah , but what &apos;s the point ?
i mean , if we &apos;re having sex ,
and we &apos;re having sex with other people ...
so , maybe we &apos;re exclusive friends with benefits ?
yeah . yeah , that works .
but we &apos;re not , you know , dating .
no , no . we &apos;re just ...
friends with benefits who don &apos;t have other friends with benefits .
deal .
good .
i came to help .
sweet .
so , clothes go there ,
and dishes and kitchen stuff goes over there .
sounds good .
okay .
that was really cool , what you said .
i couldn &apos;t believe the look on renee &apos;s face .
and if any of those girls
ever say anything about nick to you again ,
you just have to ...
can we not talk about it anymore ?
i just want to be done with it , you know ,
once and for all .
i just want us to start over and pretend it never happened .
you got it .
thank you .
let me just grab my stuff , and i &apos;ll walk you home ?
hello ?
mariana .
it &apos;s me , nick .
hey .
i miss you so much .
when are you ... when are you going to see me ?
