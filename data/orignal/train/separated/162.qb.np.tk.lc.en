here--your one and only source
into the scandalous lives of manhattan &apos;s elite .
i got three cases of champagne for serena van der woodsen .
for me ? who &apos;s it from ?
porn and handcuffs ? this is low , chuck , even for you .
what &apos;s this ? chuck said it came for you this morning. whoa. is that coke ?
how do you like a brother who uses you as a drug mule ?
i can &apos;t believe you think chuck is doing these things. what &apos;s he done now ?
i &apos;ll tell you what he &apos;s done. if we &apos;re gonna exist under the same roof ,
i am laying down some house rules. no need , princess .
bart already kicked me out .
i &apos;m moving back to my suite . i love you , nate archibald .
always have , always will .
i want nothing else to do with you , blair. it &apos;s over .
jenny , if you walk away from me now , i will ruin you .
how are you gonna do that ? my mother &apos;s valentino was stolen .
oh , my god. that &apos;s my mother &apos;s dress .
do you think that you can just send me off to school
with a plaid skirt and a metrocard ,
and everything will be okay ? i &apos;m really sorry , chuck .
i know it wasn &apos;t you who sent me that stuff .
and who am i ?
that &apos;s a secret i &apos;ll never tell .
you know you love me .
x.o.x.o. , gossip girl .
there are three things we do alone--
we are born , we die ,
and if we &apos;re a high school junior headed for college ,
we take the s.a.t.
and while the test is said to measure our best traits ,
preparing for it
inevitably brings out the worst--
humility becomes self @-@ doubt ...
striving becomes obsession .
some are driven to self @-@ medication ...
while others cling to the security
of being part of a group .
and anyone who &apos;s used to bending the rules
will find themselves breaking them .
ugh ! dad , don &apos;t ever do that again .
just doing what i was told. time &apos;s up .
i was instructed that whenever time was up ,
i should share that information. yes ,
but the manner in which you went about it--it was like
you were deliberately trying to humiliate me. how bad ?
uh ... half . i finished exactly half in the allotted time .
well , you &apos;re a smart kid . i &apos;m a choker . i choke .
mm , just in your head. t @-@ ball. first grade. remember this ?
bases loaded , and i struck out. you were 6 .
the ball was on a tee , not moving. you &apos;ll come through .
you &apos;re basing that on what , exactly ?
blind faith ?
bye. wait .
dad , i &apos;m gonna be late . i &apos;m coming with you .
what ? you &apos;re walking me to school ? i need the exercise .
i made one mistake. it doesn &apos;t mean i need
a human ankle monitor. you used to beg me to walk you to school .
you &apos;d cry if i didn &apos;t walk you to class. that wasn &apos;t me. that was dan .
it &apos;s true , but i was 6,
and it an emotional time for me. it was post @-@ t @-@ ball . jenny ,
what you did was wrong
and really out of character .
grounding you is not just about punishment .
we need to spend some time together , reconnect. yeah , i want that , too .
just ... not in public and in front of my friends .
all right. tonight. dinner .
okay. and i have group rehearsal .
i &apos;m the alto. and i &apos;m really proud ,
but we are connecting this evening over lasagna .
hey , jen , you wanna wait up for a second ? we could take the--
well , a @-@ all right , i &apos;ll see ya at school .
2200. fair .
it &apos;s 90th percentile .
which means nelly yuki probably got 2300 .
and you don &apos;t even talk to her. why do you care how she does ?
nelly yuki has her sights set on yale , too .
what are the odds
of them accepting two girls from constance ?
and have you seen nelly yuki &apos;s extracurriculars ?
i need to kick her well @-@ rounded ass .
and they say you &apos;ve lost your edge . nelly yuki must be destroyed .
why do you keep saying her name ? because it &apos;s nelly yuki .
ew , gross. incoming--chuck. you ready ?
no , i gotta wait for dan. he &apos;s pretty stressed .
he doesn &apos;t do well with tests , so ... performance anxiety ?
bye , blair .
she really needs to tone down on the social niceties .
it &apos;s embarrassing. eventually , the two of you
are gonna have to work out your issues. what issues ? i &apos;m issue @-@ free .
and , uh , based on my exhaustive research ,
so are you .
georgina ?
according to my very reliable sources ,
georgina sparks is nowhere near our fair isle .
she &apos;s in switzerland , dating the prince of belfort .
there &apos;s a prince of belfort ? uh @-@ huh .
and she &apos;s dating him ? oh , thank god .
now you can enjoy the gifts she mailed you
with peace of mind ... and maybe chuck in the room .
oh , shoot. except we &apos;re siblings .
georgie always brought out the devil in you .
part of me is a little disappointed she &apos;s not here .
mm , i wonder which part. it &apos;s been a while since i saw the old serena .
well , thanks to her ,
the new one has to break 2000 on her s.a.t.s.
so if you could just go smarm elsewhere ...
the offer still stands . i know a , uh , lovely little redhead
that &apos;s just dying to be you for the day. oh ,
i &apos;ll leave the cheating to you , chuck .
i plan on taking the s.a.t.s myself .
you have no idea how lucky you are .
seriously , jenny .
i would do anything to be a freshman again. junior year sucks .
nate doesn &apos;t call . i &apos;m not ready for the s.a.t.s.
maybe i should join kati on the kibbutz in israel ,
quit now. you guys , it &apos;s just a test .
look , cram session tonight. my dad &apos;s making lasagna .
my brother &apos;s got tons of flash cards ,
and i &apos;m totally available to help .
that won &apos;t be necessary , little j .
you girls are all taken care of ,
courtesy of blair waldorf s.a.t. prep and spa .
are you serious ? if you &apos;re gonna sweat the test ,
it better not clog your pores .
this evening at my penthouse , you &apos;ll find personal tutors ,
hot stone massages , mani @-@ pedis and an amazing acupuncturist
who specializes in mental acuity .
guess that beats my dad &apos;s lasagna . i &apos;ll flickr over some photos for you .
oh , it &apos;s upperclassmen only . i &apos;m sure you understand .
totally .
wait up , b .
i &apos;m so glad i didn &apos;t book that flight to tel aviv .
spotted in the halls of constance--little j. realizing
that age really does come before beauty .
s.a.t.s ?
yeah. yeah , and , uh , soccer ?
why not give the old ball a kick ?
season &apos;s just around the corner ... in october .
no , no , you know what ? i have to stop doing that .
i &apos;ll just focus on myself and my--my test and my prep .
what other people do or don &apos;t do is about them , absolutely .
not a good tester , huh ?
oh , chuck , i had no idea you felt that way about me .
good to know you &apos;re at least still kind of funny .
hey , i &apos;m so sorry .
i &apos;ve been completely off the radar the past few days .
new home , new family. it &apos;s okay .
yeah , it &apos;s , um , pretty overwhelming .
yeah , i @-@ i &apos;ve been a little overwhelmed myself lately .
well , you wanna hang out ... study ?
mmm. ooh . i wanna take whatever s.a.t. prep course
you &apos;re signed up for .
well , it &apos;s not too late .
okay . i &apos;m in , then .
i &apos;ll see you .
you always did know how to leave &apos; em wanting more .
oh , my god , georgina .
what are you doing here ? well , i told you i was coming .
didn &apos;t you get my gifts ? uh ,
you &apos;re supposed to be in switzerland dating a prince .
luckily daddy didn &apos;t need the g5 .
haven &apos;t you missed me ?
how could i not ?
okay. you don &apos;t want to throw me a homecoming party .
i get it , but let &apos;s have a cocktail ,
catch up .
s. , you &apos;re really gonna hurt my feelings ,
and you know how i get when my feelings are hurt .
great . i &apos;ll see you tonight .
it &apos;s so weird seeing you. it &apos;s almost like i never left .
spotted in the courtyard--
serena looking like she &apos;s seen a ghost--
the ghost of parties past .
jenny , why did you want to meet here ? well , i &apos;ve been thinking--
what &apos;s the one thing that no one in our group has ,
i mean , not even blair ? compassion ?
no , a boyfriend. you know , if i &apos;m gonna make it to queen ,
i need a king. queen elizabeth never had a boyfriend .
but she only had the spanish to conquer ,
and i have blair waldorf. let &apos;s talk qualifications .
he has to be cute , but not full of himself .
he has to be from the right kind of family ...
ugh , but not disgusting .
come on .
i &apos;m so sorry. are you okay ?
yeah , uh , my lunch isn &apos;t , though .
oh , linus .
let me give you ... my last dollar .
oh , i couldn &apos;t .
you shouldn &apos;t be walking the streets with no money .
let &apos;s just settle for an i.o.u. then .
it &apos;s just a hot dog .
that was just my excuse to give this to you .
here &apos;s my number .
thank you .
i mean , it &apos;s fine .
i mean , i &apos;m really not even that hungry .
well , if you change your mind ...
what are you doing ? he &apos;s gorgeous .
he &apos;s a dog walker .
i need a king , not a jester .
come on. let &apos;s go lurk outside dalton .
hey . vanessa .
you &apos;re nate , right ? you play a very small but crucial role
in my video project. oh , that &apos;s right .
i remember you following dan around with your video camera. hey , nate .
what are you doing here ? i mean , i know the coffee &apos;s good ...
since i &apos;ve taken every s.a.t. prep and review class
in the five boroughs , i figured why not pay it forward ?
so--so you don &apos;t need these ?
you know , i &apos;ve actually already taken it .
my parents don &apos;t want me going to u.s.c. ,
so i had to make sure my scores were good enough
to get in without their help , which , thanks to these books ,
they were , so i &apos;m done .
while we all love hearing about the struggles of the idle rich ,
dan &apos;s got a fine tutor right here .
i ace every practice test i take ,
so we don &apos;t need your hand @-@ me @-@ downs. um , you know what ?
th @-@ this is actually pretty good .
this looks good. thank you. is there a reason you insist
on looking so desperate and needy ?
she &apos;s been like that since we were kids--
venomous without provocation. it &apos;s better than being a charity case .
she &apos;s rude , too . i see that .
yeah. well , i gotta get going ,
but i hope these are useful .
oh , yeah , yeah , very. thank you .
what ?
they &apos;re--hey , every little bit helps .
is this really the best place for us to talk ?
you of all people know
nothing gets me talking like a cosmo .
a lot has changed since we used to hang out , georgie .
i know . i get it. no , you don &apos;t get it , or you wouldn &apos;t have sent me
all those so @-@ called gifts in the first place .
oh , come on , sweetie. those were funny .
get over yourself . i was just trying to make you laugh .
how about this-- how about for one night ,
we hang out like old times , but unlike old times ,
i won &apos;t get out of control , unless you want me to .
i mean , i can totally get out--
no , okay. i @-@ i won &apos;t get out of control ,
and i totally respect that .
please stop me any time you feel like answering .
any ... time. come on .
one drink , but only one .
cheers .
where are all the tutors ?
and the masseuses ? and the smoothies ?
all that i have promised you is waiting .
and while it gives me great pleasure
to think of us crossing that s.a.t. finish line together ,
before the race can begin ,
you need to be made aware of one little thing .
nelly yuki , top in our class ,
summer schooled at the sorbonne .
lots of people do summer at sorbonne , including me .
true . penelope , you may be a national merit scholar ,
but nelly yuki is a merit scholar ...
a peabody scholar
and an intel science talent search finalist .
isabel , you &apos;re a concert pianist ,
but itzhak perlman himself gave nelly her very first violin .
hazel ...
you &apos;re just along for the ride , &apos; kay ?
but if any of us wants to live out our college dreams ,
we have to find nelly yuki &apos;s weakness
and exploit it .
so what &apos;s it gonna be-- aromatherapy or annihilation ?
what &apos;s the plan ?
it was , like , the worst thing ever ,
and then--and then , do you remember ?
do you remember when we ran out of money ?
and then i had to flash the bartender
cause we ran out of money. wait , wait. oh , my god .
remember when we were savannah and svetlana ? oh , savannah .
savannah !
i totally forgot about savannah and svetlana. svetlana .
wait , no , i think we were tiffany and angel that night .
oh , you could talk me into anything .
hey , ladies , can i , uh , get you guys another round ?
ooh. no , thank you .
my american girlfriend ,
so uptight .
they think the drink lead to the sex .
no , no , no , i wasn &apos;t being rude .
i just didn &apos;t want to take anything
if i couldn &apos;t offer anything in return .
we &apos;d be happy with just one dance .
aw. aw . i &apos;m afraid i have two left feet .
aw , this is what is the practice for. come on , lady .
who is that ?
um , no one. uh , thank you for calling back .
ahh ! nadine the beauty queen. how can i help you ?
i don &apos;t have time for this .
do you want 1 or 2 g &apos;s ?
can you just give it-- some dealer you know ?
i didn &apos;t realize i brought my grandmother .
i have to go .
hey , come here .
i &apos;m so stupid , so , so , so , so stupid .
you don &apos;t sound stupid. you sound drunk .
what have you been into ?
georgina .
good news is , she doesn &apos;t want anything except to party .
bad news is , i partied .
care to paint a picture ? does this party require clothes ?
i &apos;m supposed to be at dan &apos;s studying .
i called to tell him i &apos;d be late ,
but not this late. i @-@ i just have to call him and say--
that instead of studying with him ,
you &apos;re out with your old pal georgina .
no . i don &apos;t want him to know she exists .
my mom , blair , even you can &apos;t stand her .
dan of all people cannot know georgie .
can you help me ?
say you need me .
chuck !
hearing you scream my name is more than enough .
i &apos;ll take care of it and pick you up in ten .
hey , i &apos;ve been wondering where you were. you mean all of your life ?
uh , don &apos;t take this the wrong way , serena ,
but you sound just like this jackass we know . serena has food poisoning .
she &apos;s too sick to come to your playdate. put her on the phone .
the bathroom doesn &apos;t get reception .
somehow i don &apos;t believe you .
and i &apos;d like to say i &apos;m a little glad about that ,
but my poor , sick sister has asked for my assistance
in the matter , so i &apos;ll leave it at this--
she &apos;s not coming. don &apos;t try calling .
humphrey , always a pleasure .
i &apos;m gonna have to call you back. hey .
beautiful day you &apos;re ruining , isn &apos;t it ? do me a favor , please ,
and leave serena alone .
it was serena i was doing a favor for .
all i know is before spring break ,
everything was great. it was good .
now break &apos;s over , she &apos;s not quite herself ,
and i &apos;m--i &apos;m trying to think , what has changed in her life ?
oh , the bass family moved into it .
dan , hi .
hey. hey , how you feeling ?
good. my migraine &apos;s gone .
migraine ? i thought you had food poisoning .
yeah , that came after .
what exactly happened last night ?
i already told him .
i &apos;m asking you .
well , i got food poisoning , and then chuck helped me out .
okay , where exactly did you eat
that you got this killer food poisoning migraine ?
can we drop the interrogation ?
as soon as you tell me where my girlfriend is . i &apos;m right here with you .
look , i @-@ i gotta go to class .
i can &apos;t-- i can &apos;t do this .
this is exactly why i didn &apos;t want her to come back .
she &apos;s been back a day already and look what &apos;s happening .
if it &apos;s really that bad ,
why don &apos;t you just tell him about her ?
i can &apos;t . i &apos;ll see you later .
look , i &apos;m not stupid .
i know you &apos;re not really interested
in how my family owns half of tribeca. of course we &apos;re interested .
you &apos;re the newest member of our little club .
which is only for the smartest girls of the junior class .
our junior class only has 30 girls .
we &apos;re already an elite club. can i go now ?
you what would be hot ? you , us at g spa . i don &apos;t drink .
saks fifth ? hate shopping .
yogurt on the steps ? lactose @-@ intolerant. look ,
i really don &apos;t want any friends .
all i want is to be alone
and to never listen to flo rida ever again. what happened ?
a little backstage hit it and quit it ?
what ? no , my boyfriend broke up with me at a flo rida concert .
one minute we were waving our hands in the air
like we just didn &apos;t care , and the next ...
since the dalton guys were a bust ,
how about collegiate ?
the boys &apos; lacrosse team is working out just around ...
jenny , look .
what did i tell you about that dog walker ?
there are no kings on craigslist .
but i don &apos;t think he &apos;s the walker .
i think he &apos;s the owner .
i spy my king .
hi .
hi. how have you been ?
oh , god. not that song .
nelly yuki , what &apos;s wrong ? it &apos;s like it &apos;s happening all over again .
that song just reminds me of my boyfriend ...
my ex @-@ boyfriend , i should say .
oh , no. did he dump you ? that &apos;s horrible .
w @-@ w @-@ what was his name ? brad ? bill ?
todd ... jansen .
there &apos;s nothing like the fresh , sharp pain of a breakup .
believe me , i &apos;ve had my fair share of heartache ,
but this is about you .
tonight you &apos;re gonna come over to my house ,
and just cry till you get it all out of your system . i can &apos;t .
i have to be focused tomorrow .
you can &apos;t focus when something &apos;s on your mind ,
now can you ? come , come , come. tell me all about it .
i guess i &apos;ll just take the check , please. okay .
hey , hold that , will ya ?
daylight savings moved to march. maybe no one told you . i know i &apos;m late .
coffee , nate ?
yeah , thanks , cora .
you two know each other ? i &apos;ve been here before .
are you telling me you come all the way to brookn
for greek food ? well , when i &apos;m in brooklyn , i like to come here , yes .
cause you &apos;re in brooklyn all the time .
well , my--my father &apos;s in rehab a couple blocks away ,
and , uh , which , by the way , is why i &apos;m late . i was ...
visiting hours ... i &apos;m sorry . i didn &apos;t mean to--
no . i mean , it &apos;s not like it &apos;s some big secret .
it was on the front page of every newspaper in the city .
i guess it was , yeah .
sometimes after i &apos;m done seeing him ,
i &apos;m not ready to go back and see my mom just yet ,
so i come here and i sit and just , uh ...
think about how hard it is
to know whose side you &apos;re supposed to be on ,
mom versus dad , kid in the middle ?
confession ... i read one of your practice essays .
you left it in a book that you gave dan ,
and that &apos;s why i called you-- to apologize .
why ?
because ... i judged the cover ,
but now that i &apos;ve read the book ,
i figured you were owed some apologetic souvlaki ,
at the very least .
hey , georgie. it was good to see you last night .
when did you say you were going back to belgium ?
uh , switzerland , actually ,
and i &apos;m supposed to leave tomorrow ,
but i &apos;m not going until i get a chance
to make it up to you first. oh , nothing to make up . i had fun .
no , you didn &apos;t . i mean , until after you left ,
i don &apos;t think i really heard what you were saying .
i @-@ i didn &apos;t get it. you &apos;ve really changed .
yeah , i have .
i don &apos;t mean to sound corny ,
but ... it &apos;s a real inspiration to me .
really ?
i mean , look , i &apos;ve always thought
that i am who i &apos;m going to be for the rest of my life ,
and even those times when i maybe don &apos;t like myself ,
well ... you can &apos;t decide to be somebody else .
no , you can. yeah , listen , let &apos;s have dinner .
i @-@ i mean , i want to hear about your life ,
and if you can change , maybe there &apos;s hope for me , too .
no , i @-@ i have to study . i have s.a.t.s in the morning .
it &apos;ll just be an hour. we can time it . i promise .
the hardest drug on the table will be ... perrier .
spotted-- serena van der woodsen
being given a real life multiple choice question--
&quot; a &quot; --go home and study ,
&quot; b &quot; --get a good night &apos;s sleep ,
&quot; c &quot; --call your boyfriend
or &quot; d ... &quot;
an hour .
none of the above .
good .
hope that wasn &apos;t the wrong answer , s .
this test doesn &apos;t grade on a curve .
all right , &quot; capacious &quot; --
looks like &quot; spacious . &quot; what does it mean ? roomy .
oh , yeah .
&quot; captious . &quot;
looks like ...
that looks like &quot; capacious . &quot;
oh . i can &apos;t concentrate .
sound of your own voice distracting you ?
no. it &apos;s , uh , serena , actually .
we had an argument .
i &apos;m home !
look it. trig identities are memorized ,
my latin is resurrected , and my lit paper &apos;s finished .
impressive. mm @-@ hmm .
huh. seeing as you &apos;ve returned the valentino ,
and you &apos;ve logged ten hours of volunteer work
with betty at the shop ...
i &apos;m not grounded anymore ? i have something for you .
no way !
oh ! it &apos;s not exactly the same as the one you pawned ,
but ...
thank you , dad !
you know , jen , no one &apos;s happier than me to see this .
do you know how much it costs to get a zipper repaired ?
yeah , i figured since you &apos;d be spending so much time at home ... wait .
what ?
so i guess you &apos;re still grounded . dan .
dad , wait . i met this really nice guy ,
and i &apos;m supposed to meet him in the park for lunch tomorrow. well ,
grounded or not grounded ,
you &apos;re not old enough to date. it &apos;s not a date. he &apos;s just a friend .
who is this guy ? you don &apos;t know him. he goes to unity .
wait , upper east side unity ? technically , that &apos;s upper west side , dad .
how are you helping ?
i thought you wanted to take a break from that whole crowd .
what &quot; whole crowd &quot; ?
the one that made you feel like compromising your character
was a prerequisite to hanging out with them .
so it &apos;s okay for dan to date someone rich , though ?
well , it &apos;s not without its complications. believe me .
i thought you said it wasn &apos;t a date .
it was nice there for a minute. it was .
hey , s .
i &apos;m just sipping a gingko biloba blended
and wondering how your stomach migraine is .
call me so i don &apos;t worry .
how you doing , nelly yuki ?
my upper trapezius seems to hold a lot of sadness .
something tells me you &apos;ll be feeling better very soon ...
any minute .
no . i think i should just go home and study .
uh , mr . jansen is here to see miss yuki .
todd &apos;s here ?
do i have cushion face ?
a little .
hello , todd .
hi , nelly . blair said it was all right if i came .
for a siberian ginseng pedi ?
no .
i really feel bad about how things ended , nell .
so do i .
can we talk about it ? in private ? okay .
thank you , b .
lucky for us ,
mental acuity and common sense rarely come in the same package .
oxygen facials , anyone ?
next time your sister &apos;s band is in town ,
i want front row seats .
you don &apos;t strike me as a lesbian punk fan .
you know , i am almost offended by how much
you underestimate me , ms. abrams .
you like punk ? oh , i didn &apos;t hear you s-- you said &quot; punk &quot; ?
cause you had me at &quot; lesbian . &quot;
oh , right. didn &apos;t see that one coming .
hey , tell me something. yes ?
why do you do s.a.t. practice tests
if you &apos;re not planning on taking the exam ?
to help dan study .
i &apos;m a filmmaker. best education for me is making films .
i can &apos;t never met anyone
who thought college was optional .
my parents are artists. my sister &apos;s a musician .
just like going to an ivy is your family &apos;s way ,
not going to college is mine .
think your parents want to adopt a 17 year old ?
maybe ?
so ...
i guess this is good night , then ?
i don &apos;t live here , you know .
no , i know .
i &apos;m just grabbing my laptop .
do you want to come inside ?
god. it does feel like that doorstep moment .
and what moment would that be ?
yeah. that &apos;s the moment .
can i get you two a cocktail ?
oh . i &apos;m fine with my diet coke. thank you .
um , yeah , me , too. thanks .
so ... tell me about dan .
i did. oh , come on .
his last name and his zip code ? scintillating details .
come on. he &apos;s part of serena second edition .
well ...
i @-@ i like the way i feel when he looks at me .
how ?
like ...
like i wanna believe in myself .
i @-@ i know .
you think it &apos;s a clich ?
uh , no. no , sweetie. i @-@ i @-@ i think it &apos;s ...
it &apos;s incredible .
yeah .
look ... i know i may not be
your most trusted friend right now ,
but i think i know the old you pretty well .
yeah , better than , um , anyone , actually .
well , from where i sit , it would take ...
a lot to bring that person back .
um ... i &apos;m gonna call him , actually .
he &apos;s pretty nervous about tomorrow ,
so i wanna wish him luck. so i &apos;ll be back .
that was quick. yeah , he didn &apos;t pick up .
oh , you can try him again later. yeah .
okay , i &apos;d like to propose a toast. okay .
to the new you .
to the new me .
cheers .
ooh. you don &apos;t look so good .
you okay , s . ?
no , i &apos;m not okay .
wait , how did we get here ? what are we doing here ?
oh , my god . i &apos;m supposed to be at hunter college .
if memory serves , and it usually does ,
they don &apos;t let you in if you &apos;re late. oh , my god .
i &apos;m thinking eggs .
do you want ... florentine or benedict ?
wait . i was drinking soda , georgie .
yeah , until you switched to patron .
look , don &apos;t worry . i called lily and covered your ass .
so ... you &apos;re welcome .
no , you--you knew i had s.a.t.s this morning .
which is why i brought you here
instead of letting you go home with one of your many suitors .
you know the guy with the ironic mustache ?
you two took over the deejay booth. wait , a mustache ?
what are you talking about ?
i guess you haven &apos;t changed as much as you thought .
chuck ? chuck , hey . i &apos;m in trouble .
look , i think i can still make it ,
but please go to hunter ,
try to keep the doors open until i get there .
hey !
last night was strange , but very fun .
like ... five hours ago ?
i &apos;m taking you somewhere . i &apos;m going somewhere--to work .
get someone to cover for you . i can &apos;t just jump in the car with you
because you decide to show up. well , i &apos;m not asking you to .
this is a onetime offer , and there &apos;s a clock ticking .
but ...
fine . i am intrigued .
you wish your brother good luck today ?
yeah .
may i be excused ?
no , you may not .
and we are not gonna walk around this house all day
and not talk to each other .
fine. you want me to speak ? i &apos;ll speak .
you &apos;ve completely and entirely prejudged the upper east side .
maybe you shouldn &apos;t speak. dad , i learned my lesson on my birthday .
asher &apos;s not like those girls. he &apos;s different .
i mean , he &apos;s nice and polite and he likes animals .
please let me go today ?
so you didn &apos;t cancel ?
i thought you &apos;d change your mind .
i haven &apos;t .
nate , i don &apos;t know about this .
i can &apos;t . i didn &apos;t even study .
yeah , and you still made great scores
on your practice tests .
that was for fun .
listen , there &apos;s nothing wrong with keeping your options open .
i don &apos;t think your parents are gonna be mad at you
for choosing your own path ...
unless they &apos;re related to my parents .
okay. right now i &apos;m going inside ,
and i &apos;m not looking back , or i might change my mind .
... do really well. what ?
rough night ?
yeah , and not in a good way .
todd doesn &apos;t wanna get back together. no ?
but he said ...
we stayed up all night having the same conversation
about why we broke up over and over again. unbelievable .
i can &apos;t believe it. crazy .
i got no sleep , spent the whole night crying .
okay. well , good luck .
do you really think this is gonna work ?
yes , but i also believe in insurance .
from her calculator .
you never did tell us how you got todd to play along .
isabel , what are you doing later tonight ?
uh , not todd. okay , well ,
i guess i &apos;m gonna have to come up with something else .
dan ... where &apos;s serena ?
uh , i don &apos;t know , but i bet chuck does .
ugh. well , i &apos;ll try to save a seat for her. yeah , i &apos;ll--i &apos;ll keep calling .
hey , serena , it &apos;s me-- a @-@ a very worried me
concerned about a very missing you .
hi . i &apos;m serena van der woodsen .
how &apos;d you do ?
uh , not my finest hour .
i finished , but ... i kinda had a lot on my mind .
i &apos;ll keep calling .
yeah . i think i know where to find her .
hey , s. it &apos;s b .
now i &apos;m really worried .
i &apos;m gonna go home and change ,
and then ...

what &apos;s going on ?
um ... nothing . i &apos;m fine .
no , you &apos;re not , and you need to stop saying that .
hey. come here .
where were you ?
she was with me .
what he means is , we were both at home .
um , my stomach started acting up again. oh , okay .
a food poisoning relapse ?
look , if--if--if you didn &apos;t study enough
and you &apos;re freaked out , i can-- i told you . i was sick .
you paid someone else to take the s.a.t. for you ,
and that &apos;s the best you can do ? what are you talking about ?
i &apos;m talking about the 5 @-@ foot @-@ nothing redhead
claiming to be serena van der woodsen .
i &apos;m--i &apos;m pretty sure that wasn &apos;t you . chuck , what did you do ?
i told you to keep the doors open .
when i got there , they were closed. yeah , they don &apos;t keep the doors open .
i was thinking on my feet , just trying to help .
i &apos;m not mad. okay , i &apos;m just worried .
i &apos;ve been so worried about you .
please , help me understand what &apos;s going on here .
can we talk tomorrow ?
i &apos;ll call you .
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m sorry , too .
chuck , you went too far .
and so did you , sis .
look , i feel foolish for admitting it ,
but obviously , i &apos;ve come late to this party .
english , please .
what &apos;s georgina got on you ? chuck ...
dan i understand , but what &apos;s so bad you can &apos;t even tell me ?
oh , hi , sweetie .
let me just , uh , call some room service--
i don &apos;t want you to ever contact me again .
just because of a few nights of harmless fun ?
it wasn &apos;t fun waking up and not knowing where i was ,
it wasn &apos;t fun missing the s.a.t.s ,
and it definitely wasn &apos;t fun lying to dan .
and this is all my fault because ...
it &apos;s my fault ,
because i make huge mistakes when i &apos;m with you .
so you want to distance yourself from your &quot; mistakes &quot;
by staying away from me ?
you were there , too , serena .
it was just as much you , if not more-- this is not about last year .
it &apos;s about last night .
like you were just some innocent bystander
who walked in on-- i &apos;m not talking about it , georgina ! okay ?
and neither are you .
if i go down ,
you go down with me .
in the meantime ,
stay out of my life .
i don &apos;t need anybody in my life who doesn &apos;t want to be there .
then we &apos;re agreed .
you must be the unity boy .
uh , hopefully , there &apos;s not another one on his way .
name &apos;s asher , and i do go to unity .
hi .
asher ?
what are you doing here ?
i was just gonna ask the same thing .
uh , since you couldn &apos;t come to the hot dogs ,
i &apos;m bringing them to you .
sorry to s @-@ surprise you , sir .
that &apos;s so sweet , especially since
my unreasonable father has grounded me for life .
i &apos;m standing right here .
i wish more of my friends &apos; parents
cared enough to ground them when they messed up .
looks like our queen wannabe found her perfect king .
well , since you &apos;re here ...
with a year &apos;s supply of hot dogs ,
maybe you &apos;d like to come in .
we hear he &apos;s a unity man .
guess big brother &apos;s been teaching little sis
how to snag the ones with a trust fund .
hey , buddy , there you go .
aw ! georgie , hey !
bad boy .
sorry he disturbed you .
uh , it &apos;s fine . i love dogs .
really ? do you have any ? no. uh , we used to have a cat ,
but , you know ... sister ... allergies .
now the cat--iggy--lives in florida with my grandma .
i ... he doesn &apos;t write. he never calls .
i &apos;m sorry to hear that .
it &apos;s just a cat .
um . i &apos;m sarah , by the way .
