There's a baby in the bed.
I know there's a baby in the bed.
There's no baby in the shower.
There is no baby in the shower.
All right.
There's a baby in the shower, too.
Oh, come on. Just look the other way.
I can't do it in front of the duckies.
Yes, you can. Do it in front of the duckies.
Oh, no. Come on.
Where are we gonna go now?
Okay, stop saying that.
Good morning.
Oh, my God.
Yeah, I'm watching a pyeloplasty.
I can rewind it back to the beginning if you'd like.
No, let's go.
Hey, listen for the baby.
What?
20 minutes.
Okay.
Don't! Don't! Don't!
Stop, Derek.
Ow. Ow. That--
What?
Let's just try to move the seat back.
Okay.
Okay, okay, okay.
Is that better?
Yeah.
Oh, good. Come here.
Okay.
I'm sorry, but she woke up,
and she seemed like she wanted you guys.
But don't worry. She didn't see anything.
We're never gonna have sex again, are we?
Happy Valentine's day.
Okay, baby. There we go.
Well, listen, I can babysit tonight
if you guys need some time to... yourselves.
'cause I have, uh, no plans 'cause my life is empty.
I'm alone with no plans whatsoever, at all.
That's great.
So did you, um, did you make a reservation
somewhere beautiful with lots of flickery candles?
I made a plan. I think you'll like it.
You should pack a bag.
Oh, wow.
Overnight? Oh, gosh. Well, what about Sofia?
Mark got a sitter.
He'll be home at 11:00, and then he's got her.
All right. Well, what should I bring?
Um, a bathing suit?
Or I don't know, what are we talking here?
Uh, no bathing suit. Boots wouldn't hurt.
All right. So...cold.
Could be.
Wouldn't hurt to bring long underwear,
extra fleece.
Yeah. Hey, don't make that face.
No.
It will be fun.
Yeah. Romantic.
There are times in our lives
when love really does conquer all--
Exhaustion...
Sleep deprivation...
Anything.
And then there are those times
when it seems like love brings us nothing...
But pain.
Uh, tonight is still gonna work out, right?
Of course it is. We have a plan.
I'm just saying...
Here you go.
You cancel a lot,
because of the scalpels and cutting people open.
Look, I was promised an elegant dinner.
I rearranged my whole schedule.
I've got high heels in the back of my car.
I'm gonna spend all day thinking about 'em.
Is it camping?
I mean, does she think I'm going camping
on Valentine's day?
I don't know.
Well, she's trying to surprise me. I'm telling you,
the surprise is gonna be,
I'm gonna leave her on the side of a mountain.
I mean, do you think camping is sexy?
It's not sexy.
You can't take a baby camping.
Sofia's gonna hate it.
What d--y-you're getting a sitter.
Callie said you're getting a sitter.
Yeah, Callie also said you were going camping.
Callie's lost her mind.
Thank you.
Really, it's camping?
I don't know, but it's your night with Sofia.
Ugh. Well, I need to have sex with my wife,
apparently in the woods on cold, hard ground.
And you promised callie a sitter, so get a sitter.
Come on. This thing with Julia is young and fragile.
There's a lot of pressure.
I got us a table at Campo's.
Well, then you better find a sitter.
I have plans.
Yep. I got a hot date.
Our--our thing is-- is young and fragile, too.
We're gonna get a zillion Valen-traumas.
I bet a few of them will be good surgeries for our boards.
Well, it's not St. Patrick's Day.
Those are good traumas--
car crashes, bar brawls.
Yeah.
Yeah, Valentine's day is all swallowed engagement rings
and guys who threw out their backs getting laid.
You're just bitter 'cause you don't have a date.
First of all, Valentine's Day isn't for
having a date with some chick.
No, it's for macking the chicks who don't have dates.
Besides, I have to study for my boards.
You studying already?
Of course. You're not?
No, I am.
Who put up all this?
I did.
Well, research shows that a cheerful environment
reduces stress and helps patients to feel more...
Okay.
I have to get that baby out of my bed.
She's ruining my sex life.
Yeah, well, mine's already dead.
He's gonna leave me.
He won't.
Yeah, he will. He is.
I mean, I know it. And you know what?
I don't care.
You know, if he wants to leave,
if he wants to hate me,
then fine. I can't make someone stay.
Well, you could kinda beg him to stay.
Oh, I'm busy.
I'm focused. I'm a surgeon.
Well, everyone's a surgeon. That doesn't mean--
It does. For me, it does.
I'm brilliant. I'm gifted.
I-I don't beg.
You know, if he wants to go, then fine. I'm good.
Hey, have you guys started studying for your boards?
Yeah.
Yeah. Why?
Yeah. Cool. Me--me, too.
I need labs in bed six.
About time, Grey. Bed three.
Okay.
Well, anything for me?
Six weeks of headaches, like blinding.
We were in here last week.
They did a brain scan,
but they didn't find anything.
Said it was probably a migraine,
but the pills don't help at all.
Janell, can you rate your pain for me
on a scale of 1 to 10?
Uh, this morning, it was, like, an 11.
But now it's more like a...
Janell?
Honey?
Janell? Can you hear me?
Does this happen a lot?
Yeah. She just shuts down
'cause the pain's too much or something.
Uh, we need an E.E.G. over here.
And let's page Shepherd. Quickly, please.
Right away.
This isn't a migraine, right?
No, it's not a migraine.
She's having a seizure.
I have been off of
Dr. Altman's service now for two weeks.
I stepped over a line. You reprimanded me.
Continuing to punish me is--
Fine.
You're on her service.
Get down!
Watch out!
What was that?!
Is everybody okay?!
Are you okay?
Yes.
You sure?
Yes.
I don't know what happened! I just walked in here!
Airway seems fine, but he's got some J.V.D.
He's tachycardic with muffled heart sounds.
What happened?
Sir, you're at Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital.
Your van crashed.
No one was hurt, but we need to get you examined.
Come on.
I must have fallen asleep at the wheel for a second.
I've been working like a dog all week.
Oh, God. No, no, no. I-I gotta go. I--
Sir, relax, relax. Just lie down.
No, I have to go. I'm a florist.
These roses won't last in the open air. They're gonna wilt.
Sir, you need to calm down.
We're gonna get you out of here.
Maintain in-line stabilization.
We need to get trauma labs, films, and ultrasound.
Make sure that C.T. is available,
and page Altman.
Right away, doctor.
She's not responding to the seizure medication, Randy.
She is in serious danger of suffering severe brain damage,
which is why I'd like to place her
in a medically induced coma.
A-a coma? What do you mean?
Basically, a deep sleep to prevent
the seizures from damaging her brain.
It will also buy us some time
so we can figure out what's causing them.
She just turned 32.
We've never talked about medical decision-type stuff.
Well, every seizure Janell has
hurts her brain a little bit more.
We need to do this now.
Oh, god. Yeah. Please do it.
Okay.
Do it, please.
Push 150 milligrams of propofol.
Call respiratory while I prep for intubation.
Kepner, forget the flowers.
Throw them out and get back to work.
We've got more people coming in.
Kepner.
You're not throwing those flowers away?
But--but he--
He doesn't need to know.
Throwing away perfectly good flowers.
Everyone's a cynic these days...
Talking about not believing in Valentine's Day.
I mean, what's wrong with a day
devoted to the person you love?
I take this day very seriously.
I know you do. Happy anniversary, sir.
Mm. Thank you, Dr. Grey.
I'm heading home early,
try and spend most of the day with my wife.
W-what about you? You hitting the town?
I'm not hitting much of anything these days.
Oh, God. I'm sorry.
That was crass.
I'm h--uh, uh, have no Valentine's plans.
What the hell was I thinking?
I should've listened to my mom.
I used to be young! I used to be pretty!
I have wasted my entire youth on you!
Charlie Bilson, 32, hit by a car
when he ran head-on into traffic.
Complains of chest and back pain.
I thought it would happen! How stupid could I be?
Has abdominal tenderness on palpation.
How stupid?!
And it looks like a broken nose.
I cannot believe you did this!
Okay, if you hadn't made me chase you down--
You should not have chased me.
You shouldn't have bothered,
because it's over.
This is over.
What happened?
We're having breakfast in bed.
One second, you're so happy--
I thought you were going to propose!
Well, what do you think?
Well, she's wheezing, but we'll treat that.
You're gonna be just fine, uh...
Clementine. Uh, I think the kids call her Clem.
You're not the mom?
She's on her way. She was at the gym.
I'm just the moron that bought the box of peanut clusters
for the kid who's allergic to nuts.
My son wanted to give her a Valentine.
She took a bite, and this happened.
I'm--I'm gonna start you on a breathing treatment.
And then I'm gonna give you an I.V. with medicine
to treat the rash, okay?
Okay. All right.
Here.
If it hurts, you can squeeze my hand,
hard as you want.
Okay, Clem, here we go.
Ready?
One, two...
Three. Okay.
Good.
Honestly, those little boxes?
They taunt me, Charlie.
I would rather a nice coffee table book
or maybe even a mug,
because then at least I wouldn't get my hopes up
every freakin' Valentine's Day
when you pull out the little velvet box.
You didn't even look at the necklace.
I didn't have to. It wasn't a ring.
Oh, that's a...
pretty nasty cut there.
Dr. Grey.
You want to take a look?
Sure.
Come with me.
A man should get to bleed in peace.
Thanks.
What?
Mm. I was trying to figure out
why this patient's having seizures
when I noticed she has a hemolytic anemia.
Uh, which means she's having an autoimmune response.
Right. If antibodies are attacking her red blood cells,
who's to say that antibodies couldn't be attacking her brain,
causing the encephalitis?
Oh, and it's not a brain tumor.
That's why you paged me.
Well, yeah, and I thought we could spend
Valentine's Day together.
Uh, you may not have Valentine's Day plans,
but I do, Grey,
plans that I am not willing to forfeit.
So here's how this is going to go--
In a timely and efficient manner,
you and I will rule out everything that could be
causing this woman's body to attack itself,
virus by virus, tumor by tumor,
until we land on the one thing--
It's a teratoma.
What?
I sent off Janell's CSF from her spinal tap
for anti-NMDA receptor antibodies,
and it just came back positive.
Show off.
Let's get a scan.
Is this our flower guy?
Yeah. He has aintrapericardial diaphragmatic hernia.
Whoa. How did his abdominal organs
get into the sac around his heart?
Uh, his chest hit the wheel when he crashed.
Well, I'm gonna have to reduce the hernia.
Book an OR.
Bump any nonemergent patients,
and find someone to scrub in with me.
Dr. Hunt has agreed to let me back on your service,
so I can scrub in with you.
Really?
We need to get in there and do the repair
before he tamponades,
so we should move as quickly as possible.
Like I'm ever anything but.
You must think I'm such a bitch.
No.
It's been eight years.
And it's--it's-- every Valentine's Day,
the buildup gets worse.
This morning he wakes me up, and breakfast in bed,
and then he tells me, he booked dinner
and a nice hotel at the pier,
and then he pulls out another cheap ass necklace.
Eight years.
We're not exactly teenagers.
Maybe he doesn't know how much you want it.
We go to 20 weddings a year,
and I sob like a lunatic at every one.
I'm not that sentimental.
He knows.
He knows.
C.T. shows extensive internal bleeding.
He's also hypotensive.
We have to get him up to the O.R. now.
What--what's going on? What's happening?
We're taking your fiance to surgery.
He is not her fiance.
Suction.
Watch the...
Oh, sorry. Sorry.
So anybody got any good Valentine's plans?
My husband died
in this O.R. a month ago.
Dr. Yang performed the surgery.
I was in a 7-hour surgery
and didn't know that he had died.
Dr. Hunt kept that a secret.
So I don't speak to him.
He wants a baby.
Dr. Yang doesn't.
So they don't speak to each other
even though they're married.
So...
No.
How about you?
My girlfriend and I are gonna...
Nothing.
Nothing.
We think this thing on Janell's lung
is something called a teratoma.
It's creating antibodies that are attacking her brain.
Well, I don't get it.
Basically, her body sees the tumor as an invader
and is attacking it,
and her brain is getting hurt in the crossfire.
So this thing on her lung is causing her seizures?
I think so.
We'll have to remove it and test it to make sure.
O-okay, so you take it out, her headaches stop,
and she wakes up from the coma,
and we get to go on to live our lives?
That's the plan.
Okay.
We've known each other since high school.
She's my better half.
I mean, I know people always say that...
But she really is.
You paged me for this?
Why would I do this?
Because it's fair.
Because the three of us are equal parents to Sofia
and this is the fair way to decide who stays in with her.
Unless you'd rather raise her
with no sense of fairness or decency...
in anarchy and chaos.
Your call.
Okay. Fine.
Best two out of three?
Best two out of three.
You ready?
Rock, paper, scissors.
Rock, paper, scissors.
My rock!
Crushes your scissors.
Rock--hold on, hold on. Time-out.
Time-out? I'm sorry, time-o--time-out?
Jackson, team huddle.
Oh, my gosh. Are you guys kidding me?
I mean, some of us have surgeries.
Can you just give us a second?
What do you think?
I think she's going paper.
She's going with rocks.
I'm thinking she's a rock thrower.
Yeah, that's what she wants you to think. All right?
That's why she did it two times in a row.
This time, trust me... go scissors.
Okay, you guys, it's not a chess game.
Can we just-- can we do this?
Get out there.
All right.
Here we go.
Rock, paper, scissors.
No!
Oh, yes!
Damn it!
I'm getting lucky tonight. Happy babysitting.
See you later.
All right.
Avery, I said rocks.
My gut told me rocks.
You messed with my head.
You asked my opinion.
Julia's gonna kill me.
She's having a severe reaction. Sorry, Clem.
It looks like we're gonna have to give you a shot.
Hand?
Yes, please.
Excuse me.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Oh, Clem.
Oh, honey.
You poor thing.
Hi, mom.
She's gonna be fine.
The doctor's gonna give her a shot.
He's on top of it.
Well, I'm glad someone is.
I didn't know.
The school sends home notes all the time.
It's in every newsletter.
She can't even be near peanut butter.
I have a job, Terri, okay? Three kids.
Excuse me if I don't read every note the school sends home.
I gave her a shot of epinephrine.
It should do the trick.
He's hypothermic.
Yeah. There's too much bleeding.
He's not gonna make it if we keep going.
Let's pack him and get him up to I.C.U.
to stabilize him.
I am not babysitting.
I have made your career,
and I can break it.
I need to check for a septal hematoma.
I'll be quick. I got a date tonight.
What makes you think I could babysit?
Well, you know C.P.R., you can think on your feet,
you're fit,
you can run out of a burning building in no time.
Septum looks fine.
And I'm not gonna cancel a date on Valentine's Day.
Women claim that they don't care, but they all do,
a lot.
Okay, uh, let's prep him for I.C.U.
and I'll -- I'll stay and monitor him.
No, it's your anniversary. I'll stay.
I thought you had a hot date.
Really? With who?
Uh, Dr. Sloan, I mean,
if you're finished here, we'd like to --
Oh, I'll tell you who's finished.
You're finished.
Thank you.
I already pressed it.
Whatever.
I'm moving out.
So if you need me, I'll be at my mom's
till I, uh...
figure something out.
Okay?
Okay.
Hey, I got your message your lung resection went long.
I pushed our reservations to 8:00.
Really? Just like that on Valentine's Day?
I got connections.
I could even push 'em to 9:00 if you like.
No. Absolutely not. No.
As soon as path confirms
that the mass we took out was the teratoma,
I will go out to my car,
grab those heels...
Benign granuloma.
All right, fine.
Push the reservation to 9:00.
Why are you still here? You can go.
I'd love to. I'd love nothing more.
But Nico won't leave until he knows Clem's gonna be okay.
He's 10. Who's the parent here?
You let that kid run wild.
At least I don't hover over him,
afraid to let him out of my sight.
Well, maybe I need to hover
because you and your son won't leave us alone.
What were you thinking, dropping him
at my house today when I wasn't home?
He wasn't gonna stay.
He just wanted to give your spoiled daughter
a box of freakin' chocolates.
Well, stop giving us things.
We barely survived the head lice he gave her.
You have no way of knowing who gave who the head lice.
Okay, that's enough.
They're 10. They're in love. They're cute.
Let them be cute, for crying out loud.
Excuse me, doctor, something's wrong with Clem.
She's breathing funny.
Get me a size 6 E.T. tube.
What's happening?
Her airway is shutting down.
I'm gonna have to intubate.
Oh, my God.
Here you go.
Give me some crike pressure.
All right.
I'm in.
All right.
There's good color change.
SAT's are coming up.
What happened?
Anaphylactic shock.
We're gonna have to keep her overnight
and see how she responds.
But -- but she's gonna be okay?
Yeah, yeah, I think so.
Now will you go?
Please.
It doesn't make any sense.
Janell's labs show she has a teratoma.
Then the lucky woman has two tumors --
the benign one that we just took out of her lung
and another one --
Where?
Her scans and her ultrasound are clean.
What if it's microscopic?
Okay, um...
what do we know about N.M.D.A?
receptor teratomas?
We know they're most commonly found
On the ovaries.
You want to take out her ovaries?
She's 32 years old.
They're always 32 and nice and undeserving.
These kind of things don't happen to nasty people.
His vitals are holding.
That's good.
Mm. His pupils are a little sluggish.
Sharon, are you okay?
Can I get you anything?
I had a ring picked out.
I sent a picture of it
to all of my sisters.
So, uh, they could help Charlie surprise me
when the time came,
'cause that ring was important.
It was so freaking important.
Look at him.
He looks--he's... he looks...
I don't care about that crap anymore.
And I don't need a stupid ring.
I just...
I just need him.
That's it. I just want him to be okay.
Please. Just let him be okay.
Your incision looks good.
You should be back on your feet in a few weeks,
but I wouldn't recommend pulling any more all-nighters,
even on holidays like today.
Oh, trust me, brother. I'm done.
I mean, what a stupid business.
People call you up. You know,
they ask you to make something beautiful.
Yeah, so some sorry schlep can forget that
they've been treated like crap every other day of the year.
Yeah, like my flowers are magic or something.
But I bought it.
Nearly killed myself trying to make sure
everybody got their little miracle.
What a joke.
People oughta just stop being so awful to each other,
you know?
Leave me out of it.
Dr. Yang will check on you later.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Can I just talk to you for a minute?
I know you've been through hell,
and I know I was part of it.
And I know you're grieving,
and there's no magic solution to that, but...
We used to be friends.
And I really...
really need a friend today.
So how about we just go across the street to Joe's,
and I'll buy you a drink, you know?
Or I will buy you many, many drinks.
Are you done?
Are you finished?
Yes.
I hate you.
From the moment you decided to put the needs of your hospital
over my dead husband, I have hated you.
I lie in bed at night alone,
and I look at the spot where my husband used to sleep,
and I actively,
with every cell in my body, hate you.
I wish you were dead instead of him.
I think about all the soldiers, good men,
who died over there in Iraq,
and I don't understand what kind of god
would allow you to survive.
We are not friends.
This is not grief. It will not pass.
I hate you!
Please... don't speak to me again
unless it's work related.
L-l-let me-- let me get this straight.
All right, you--you take this thing out of her lungs,
and it's not what you thought it was.
Now you want to take out her ovaries.
The kind of antibodies that she had
are most commonly associated with teratomas of the ovaries.
But they can sometimes be found in other places,
which is why we thought the mass on her lung was it.
Chances are high that it's on her ovaries.
Chances are?
That's the best you can do?
She's young.
She still wants kids. We...
No.
You're doctors.
You're gonna have to do a hell of a lot better
than "Chances are."
If we do nothing,
She will continue to have the seizures.
And eventually, her body will just completely shut down.
And by that time, she will have suffered
so much brain damage.
That Janell, the woman that you love, she'll be gone.
The nougats are gone. Sorry.
Did you get these from a patient?
No.
I bought these for Julia, but...
She's standing me up
for an emergency ocular transplant surgery, so...
Mm. I'm gorging myself on Valentine's chocolate.
Mm. I'd mock you right now
if my mouth wasn't so full.
Try the square ones.
They're caramel with sea salt.
I didn't want to disappoint her.
You know, I bought candy and flowers.
I got rose petals, Lex.
Bags of 'em.
I was looking forward to sharing it.
But now I'm alone on Valentine's Day...
Eating chocolate.
I can do you one better.
My hot date tonight?
Zola.
I am babysitting.
Let's move! He's coding! He's crashing.
What is that? What's happening?
What are you... what are you doing?
Can someone please tell me what is happening?
Sharon...
He was just fine one second ago.
No, you need to go. Now!
What's happening?
Somebody page Dr. Webber. Taking over compressions.
He's in v-fib.
Push an amp of epi and charge the paddles to 360.
Is it loaded?
Okay. Yep, we're doing it.
Clear.
He's hemorrhaging. Probably in D.I.C.
Okay, charge again. Go.
Hang some F.F.P. and factor VII.
Clear.
Oh, God. No.
I'm so sorry.
His heart stopped. We tried to revive him,
but despite our best efforts, he didn't make it.
He died at 7:53 p.m.
No indication of a tumor.
It could be microscopic.
There's a lot of adhesions on this one,
that could mean inflammation.
Which could mean a teratoma.
So let's take out the right ovary,
send it to path, and try to save the left one.
Dr. Grey, I'm the G.Y.N.
I really should be the one...
Okay, but you're a third year,
and I can't trust third-year hands.
Boki, clamp.
I'm goin' with her.
Ever thought you'd be wishing so hard
to find a tumor?
No! No! No!
Honey, we're leaving now.
No, I'm not! I promised Clem I'd stay with her!
Nico, don't make me pick you up.
You're too big for this.
Come on. She's...she's right, dude.
This is embarrassing, you know?
I'm a little embarrassed for you.
I don't care.
What's Clem gonna think if she wakes up and I'm gone?
She'll think that I don't love her.
Uh... look, uh...
What if I'm there when she wakes up?
I'll tell her whatever you want.
It's like the next best thing to being there.
Promise?
Yeah.
You're gonna need a pen and a pad of paper.
Oh, good. Uh, all right. Here we go.
Pathology's back.
The ovary specimen you sent is normal.
No pathology seen.
Damn. We picked the wrong ovary.
There's a chance the other one's clean, too.
You don't have a very good personality, you know that?
The teratoma is there. It has to be.
Well, if not, we'll have just sterilized a woman
for no reason.
I'm done. I'm...I'm...
I am done with him.
Owen?
Yeah.
He actually thinks that we can just forget
everything that happened.
I don't even know how to...
How can he think that we would ever,
ever be friends again?
Standing over me
is not gonna make me read it any faster.
This part of the specimen is a little abnormal,
but until I look at a couple more slides...
Move over.
No.
Move... over.
Oh, fine.
Dr. Bailey, see what I see?
I haven't confirmed it yet.
A mix of different cell types,
which is compatible with teratomas.
Is that what you see?
Dr. Russell?
Okay, yes.
I'd say, it's very likely a teratoma.
Yes!
Teratoma!
Hey.
How you feeling?
Okay.
Yeah?
W-where's Nico?
Well, he wanted to stay, but, you know,
His mom made him go.
Figures.
Yeah.
Oh, but he, uh, he told me a few things he wanted to say.
But, uh, well, here we go.
"Dear Clementine,
I'm really sorry you're sick.
But I'm not sorry you're my girlfriend.
It's the worst, being alone on Valentine's Day...
but I'm thinking about you right now.
I'm thinking about holding hands with you
and jumping on the trampoline together.
I love you."
"And P.S....
I don't care who gave who lice,
I'm just glad we both had it together.
Love, Nico."
I'd say you picked a good one.
What should we do?
You want to see if the game's on?
I got steak and I bought a really good red,
and a salad, and I'm gonna cook for you.
Avery...
I have a girlfriend.
And she's operating tonight,
so as soon as you put Sofia down,
you can help me study for my boards,
'cause I am behind.
Way behind.
What'd you pay for that bottle of wine?
50 bucks.
I'm not great at surprises.
I-I-I wish I was,
but I know we're camping.
Mm-hmm. You know, I'm pretty sure that
we're smack-dab in the center
of one of Washington's fine national parks,
And I'm trying--I'm trying to have a good attitude,
but this whole blind thing is just not helping matters.
Wow. This is you with a good attitude.
Oh, fine. I'll shut up.
Okay. Are you--hey, are you peeking?
No. I'm not-- no, I'm not peeking.
All right.
Okay.
Okay. Are you ready?
Are you ready? Are you ready?
Derek's trailer?
I figured, he wasn't using it,
so I asked for the key.
We really are camping.
Fun. Fun. Yes, fun.
Yeah!
We're not really camping.
No. You hate camping.
I do.
I really do.
I mean, it's almost camping, only...
there is a bed...
Oh.
and lingerie.
No one's around for miles.
Our patient's seizures stopped,
and you know why?
No.
Because I found this teratoma on her ovary.
Well, you know, you could've told me this at dinner.
You didn't have to show me a chopped up ovary.
Little sucker thought it could hide from me, but it couldn't.
It took a while,
but I finally figured out where it was,
and I went in and nailed it.
You are so sexy when you're looking at a teratoma.
Yeah?
Grade five?
Uh, ruptured?
Yeah, send him over.
Blunt trauma to the kidney.
Guy crashed into a pole,
not only shattering his kidney and his renal artery,
but ruining my Valentine's Day.
Let me do it.
Oh, no.
Sir, uh, I-I don't want to ruin your night, too.
Just go. Get home. Oh, and it's your anniversary.
Oh, for god sake. A-Adele's probably so angry at you--
I just went home.
She didn't recognize me.
She thought I looked like a nice guy
and invited me to join her for dinner,
uh, flirted with me over steaks,
thought I had a nice smile.
So, no, Dr. Bailey,
my wife's not mad right now.
In fact, I think she's falling in love with me.
Sir...
I'm so sorry.
Yeah, go. Go.
I'd like to be alone right now
with a kidney and a scalpel.
Go.
I'm just gonna go.
I'm gonna go and I'm gonna tell him,
and if there is a, uh, ch--
No, I'm not gonna tell him.
No, I'm gonna-- of course...
Ugh! Okay, of course. No, I'm gonna tell him
because if you don't say anything,
then you--you bleed out and die
and then read about it in a plastic locket.
I mean, what--what do-- what do you think?
What should I do?
Zola?
Tell me.
Oh, look. Oh, hey, hi.
Hey.
Oh, look, no, she's up, she's eaten.
Yeah. Good.
She's ready to roll. I'm gonna take-
Okay,
so we just need we just need an hour.
No, I'm gonna take off.
Yeah,
take her with you. Drive her around.
She loves that.
No, what? What?
Zola, we'll be back.
Okay, I-I'm still in my scrubs. I-I know.
I'm sorry. I had a surgery and then another one came in,
and I know it seems like I blew you off,
but I didn't. We can still go to dinner.
Dinner is over.
It's--it's 11:23 p.m..
You blew me off for dinner hours ago.
I ruined our Valentine's Day?
Miranda, I--
I'm a terrible person.
I-I know. I don't make time like I should.
Uh, I'm not good at, you know, romance-y... things,
But, look, I am working,
and you can't fault me for that.
You can't fault me for saving lives.
And if--if you're going to break up with me
for missing a dinner because I was saving a life,
then, you know, I don't even want
to have romance-y things with you--
Okay, Miran-Miranda.
Wait. Why are you in a suit?
Because it's 11:23 p.m..
Valentine's Day isn't over yet.
You threw this together today?
Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no.
I've been planning this for weeks.
See, I knew there was no chance in hell
that we'd make a scheduled reservation.
So, uh, I booked Marco here.
I mean, I'm dating Dr. Bailey.
I know the drill.
I know you.
You know me.
Oh, and, uh, I even had Marco
put extra crumb topping on your mac and cheese.
I know you.
Okay.
Thank you, sir.
Miranda.
I happen to be very good
at romance-y things.
You are.
We're always looking for ways to ease the pain.
I thought maybe the, uh, the girls
could have a play date.
And, um, we could, uh, uh, to talk,
you know, about stuff,
'cause there's some stuff
that I've been wanting to say.
Is that Julia?
I'll--I'll go.
Avery's cooking me dinner.
Is that Julia? 'cause I can go.
Oh. That's...
But he can go...
if you want to talk.
Should he go?
Nope.
It's nothing. I--you-- I'm ju--
I'm gonna--it's-- you know what?
You two have a very pleasant evening.
Don't be stupid. You love steak.
Sofia, your friend's here.
Sometimes we ease the pain
by making the best of what we have.
Sometimes it's by losing ourselves in the moment.
Please.
Don't hate me.
I'm begging you.
And sometimes all we need to do to ease the pain...
is call a simple truce.
