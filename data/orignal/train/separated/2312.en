For over a century, I have lived in secret until now.
I know the risk, but I have to know her.
Elena, she's a dead ringer for Katherine.
Hello, brother.
Damon.
He killed Zach.
He killed Tanner. He turned Vicki.
I have to kill him.
No, you can't do that.
You were right to stay away from me.
What is that?
Very important crystal.
That belonged to one of the most powerful
Witches of our family, Emily Bennett.
I want my crystal back.
Bonnie has it.
Get it from her.
Don't be giving that back to anybody.
Today we're going to talk about shadow reckoning.
This is a method of measuring heights
By the sun's shadow.
Let's say, for example, that we're going
To measure the distance of the shadow.
We're gonna take this measurement here,
Measure the length,
And we're going to multiply that the height of the source.
Building height can also be measured using a kilometer.
Which we are going to make it in class tomorrow.
I'm going to give you a hand-out about...
Hello?
Please help me.
Who are you?
I'm Emily.
You know that.
We are family.
Where am I?
This is where it started.
And this is where it has to end.
No. This isn't real.
Help me.
What are you looking at?
Turn around.
Have you even talked to Bonnie?
No. I'm mad at her. She needs to make the first move.
Be the bigger person.
Impossible in her presence.
Why are you so pissed at her, anyway?
She's a thief. That's why.
I gave her my necklace, and she refuses to give it back.
It's a matter of principle.
All right. Well, I tried.
I'm officially out of it.
Good. Your turn.
Where's Stefan? Have you talked to him?
He's avoiding me.
Why?
It's complicated.
I'll see you later.
Bye.
Good morning, everyone.
Alrighty.
Let's see.
...A-R-I-C
S-a-l-t-z-m-a-n.
Alaric Saltzman.
It's a mouthful. I know.
Doesn't exactly roll off the tongue.
Saltzman is of German origins.
My family emigrated here in 1755 to Texas.
I, however, was born and raised in Boston.
Now, the name Alaric
Belongs to a very dead great-grandfather
I will never be able to thank enough.
You'll probably want to pronounce it "Ala-ric,"
But it's "A-lar-ic," ok?
So you can call me Rick.
I'm your new history teacher.
Rise and shine.
You'll be late for school.
What are you... what are you doin'?
Peace offering.
Come on. You need it for blood circulation.
Does dead flesh good.
All right, I'm sorry.
Step aside, please.
I got the town off our back.
It was for the greater good, but I'm sorry.
And to prove it, I'm not gonna feed on a human
For at least a week.
I'll adopt the Stefan diet,
Only nothin' with feathers.
'Cause I realize that killing your closest
And oldest friend is beyond evil,
And yet somehow, It's worthy of humor.
Are you mimicking me?
Yes, Stefan. Now that the secret society
Of vampire haters is off our back,
I can go back to my routine
Of how can I destroy Stefan's life this week.
And I can go back to sulking and Elena-longing
And forehead brooding. This is fun. I like this.
And I will finally reveal the ulterior motive
Behind my evil and diabolical return to Mystic falls.
Yeah. I'm done.
That's just like you, Damon.
Always have to have the last word.
And then I ended up at the remains
Of old fell's church before I woke up back in the woods.
And you always see your ancestor Emily?
Huh.
Do you believe in ghosts?
2 weeks ago, I'd say no, but now...
I think I'm being haunted.
I don't get it. Why Emily?
Grams said she was a powerful
Witch back in the civil war day.
And that this medallion was hers,
A witch's talisman.
And it all started when you got the necklace?
I think she's using it to communicate with me.
Ok, what does grams say about it?
I can't call her. She's gonna tell me to embrace it.
I don't want to embrace it. I want it to stop.
Hey, Mr. Saltzman, I'm, uh...I'm Jeremy Gilbert.
You wanted to see me?
You know that your old teacher
Had a jackass file?
No joke. It's, uh, typed on a label.
It has all the, uh, troublemakers in it,
But really it's just an opus to you.
Don't worry about it.
I'm not him.
Clean slate.
Now...
Let's talk about grades.
I know it's been a rough couple of months,
But I've been... I've been trying to turn them around.
Yeah, I saw that,
But the problem is
We're halfway through a semester,
And half a fail is still pretty bleak.
This is the part where you say to me,
"What can I do to? I wanna change that."
Well, I'm glad you asked.
How do you feel about extra credit?
Yeah. Yeah, totally. Whatever.
Good. Write me a paper then.
Ok. About what?
History.
Pick a topic. Keep it local.
No Wikipedia Regurgita.
These old towns have a lot of rich history,
So just get your hands dirty,
Make it sing, and you're back on track.
Deal?
Uh, yeah. Deal.
That's a, uh... that's a cool ring.
Oh, thanks. It was my father's.
Heh. Llittle garish, but family.
You know.
You've got a week.
Hey.
Hey. What is that?
What is what?
The "hey."
It was twice. That is 2 heys. That...
Do you have any other words in your vocabulary?
What's wrong with "hey"?
It reeks of awkward subtext.
You spent the night in my bed,
There was cuddling, and then you snuck out before dawn
So you wouldn't have to face me,
Which I must say is a total lame guy
Move that I did not appreciate
And now with the heys?
Seriously? I mean,
I may have been some pathetic,
Insecure mess at the party
But do not mistake that for me being a pushover,
Because I do not let guys mess with my head anymore.
I heard your mom in the morning,
And I didn't want to get you in trouble,
So I went out the window.
You went out the window? Well, another lame guy move.
Your mom's the sheriff.
And as for the heys, I'm pretty sure
It's what I've said to you every day since the first grade.
Oh.
Tryin' to read somethin' into it...
Lame girl move.
You weren't in class. I was worried.
Yeah, I got your messages, and sorry
I didn't get back to you
What I wanna say shouldn't be said over the phone.
A simple "I didn't kill my
Brother" text would have sufficed.
I didn't kill my brother,
As much as he deserved it.
He has you to thank for that.
So what did you wanna tell me?
I won't be coming to school anymore.
I'm gonna back off and keep my distance.
It's the right thing to do.
Back off from school or...
From me?
Thank you for telling me.
It's better this way.
Yep. I got it.
You're angry.
That's good.
Be easier if you hate me.
Ok, it's your last chance.
I'm gonna scream.
Oh, no, don't do that.
Let's stay on point.
Listen, I want my necklace.
You can't have it.
Well, I can't take it, but you can give it to me.
I'm trying to help you here.
I don't want your help.
You do want my help, and you don't even know it.
You know why, you little witch?
'Cause you have stumbled into something
You need to stumble out of.
Just leave me alone, or I swear I'll...
Ooh. Don't. No threats.
Look-A...You hurt me last time.
B...I wish you no harm.
Believe it or not, Bonnie, I wanna protect you.
Let me help you get Emily off your back.
How do you know about her?
I know a lot of things
And I know more about that crystal than you do
And I know that she's using it
To creep inside of you.
See how scared you are?
And you should be, because I will get that crystal,
Even if I have to wait for Emily to give it to me herself.
So next time she comes out to play
You tell her...
That deal's a deal.
He's bad news, Elena.
He really scared me.
You need to stay as far away from Damon as possible.
I'm trying. he just keeps showing up.
I don't want you to be alone.
You're sleeping at my place tonight.
We can make a whole night out of it.
Where are you going?
Are you ok?
Now I am.
All my problems were because of that thing.
Can't believe I didn't do that sooner.
What's your grams gonna say?
Grams isn't the one being haunted
By a 150-year-old ghost, is she?
Ok, then.
I like a man who can dine alone.
A quiet strength.
I thought you were still
In that whole Logan depression thing.
Oh, I've sworn off men forever
But it doesn't mean I can't observe
Them from a safe distance.
Well, I can introduce you.
Thanks for coming.
I wouldn't have called if it wasn't important.
I know that.
He threatened her, Stefan.
What would Damon want with Bonnie?
She has this necklace. caroline got it from Damon
And she gave it Bonnie
And now Damon wants it back.
He's tormenting her.
Over a necklace.
It's not just any necklace.
It has to do with Bonnie's heritage.
It belonged to one of her ancestors
Who lived here during the civil war.
When you and Damon lived here.
Her name was Emily.
She was Katherine's handmaid
And a witch.
You know?
About Bonnie?
The first night that you invited me over
For dinner, I made the connection.
And now Damon knows
And for some reason, he wants that necklace.
What does it look like?
It's, um, an antique iron setting with a...
With an amber crystal.
I know it. It belonged to Katherine.
Emily gave it to her, which means that...
What?
I don't know
But I'm gonna find out.
Let me talk to Damon.
Will he tell you?
I'll...I'll get it out of him.
Have you picked a topic?
No, not yet. It's gotta be local
And non-internet research, so...
Well, that's easy. You got all your dad's stuff.
What stuff?
How the Gilberts came over
On the "Mayflower" stuff
All that family lineage from way back.
Your dad really loved all that family history stuff.
It's all boxed up in the closet.
Mr. Saltzman.
Hey. What's up, man?
This is my aunt Jenna.
Alaric saltzman. it's nice to meet you.
Jeremy was just telling me about his paper.
Thanks for giving him another chance.
Oh, you know, it was my first day.
I wanted to make a good impression.
So, Stefan...
You know, I been thinking...
I think we should start over
Give this brother thing another chance.
We used to do it oh, so well once upon a time.
I don't, Damon.
I can't trust you to be a nice guy.
You...you kill everybody, and you're so mean.
You're so mean, and...
You're really hard to imitate,
And then I have to go to that lesser place.
Can I get a coffee, please?
So what's with the bottle?
I'm on edge. Crash diet,
And I'm trying to keep a low profile.
Mm. You could always just leave,
Find a new town to turn into your own personal gas 'n' sip.
I'll manage.
You know, you don't have to keep an eye on me.
I'm not here to keep an eye on you.
So why are you here?
Why not?
I'm sorry.
There. I said it.
If you want the ugly-ass necklace,
Keep it.
It's yours.
Will you hate me if I tell you I threw it away?
You threw it away?
I know it sounds crazy,
But the necklace was giving me nightmares.
I had to get rid of it.
You could have just given it back to me.
Why? so you could give it back to Damon?
Screw Damon.
Are we doing manicures or what?
who has their kit?
Mine's in my bag.
So, Elena... hmm?
How long do you think this fight with Stefan's gonna last?
Is it like a permanent thing?
I don't know, Caroline.
Heh. Why are you such a little liar, Bonnie?
What?
Caroline!
I'm not lying to you, Caroline. I swear.
It's true. I watched her throw it into a field.
Well, then explain it.
Emily.
Who's Emily?
The ghost.
Oh, the ghost has a name now?
Caroline, please.
I wonder why she won't leave me alone.
Ok, what is going on?
Why am I not a part of this conversation?
You guys do this to me all the time.
That's not true.
Yes, it is.
I can't talk to you. You don't listen.
That's not true.
I'm a witch.
And don't we all know it?
See? That's what I'm talking about.
I'm trying to tell you something. You don't even hear it.
I listen.
When do I not listen?
Jeremy totally ditched me.
Where'd he go?
Home. It's not far. He can walk it.
So are you... are you from here?
Are you a townie?
I'm a returnee.
Left town for a while. Now I'm back.
Why'd you leave?
school.
And then there's the real reason.
I was wronged.
Guy named Logan.
What'd he do?
Basics...
Lied, cheated,
Lured me back in, left me again.
Your turn. Any sad relationship stories?
The basics...
Fell in love, married young,
My wife died.
Yeah. that's always a good conversation stopper.
What happened?
Well, you, me, and the, uh,
North carolina police department
Are all wondering the same thing.
It's, uh...it's what's known as a cold case.
So why'd you move here?
Oh, a change of pace,
New scenery.
I like it here. It's...
Got a rich history.
Lucky shot.
More like a carefully honed skill over many decades.
You're beating me.
Well, yeah.
It's because I'm better than you.
I'm onto you. Reverse psychology?
I mean, it's a little transparent,
But I admire the effort.
You prefer the brooding forehead?
Seriously, what game do you think you're playing?
That's a funny question considering the fact
That I have been asking you that for months.
It's frustrating, isn't it?
Touche.
Bonnie.
Look, it's just not me, ok?
I don't believe in the...
Whoo whoo.
But if you do, then ok. I'm in.
That's all it takes for me to jump on board,
Because I consider you to be my best friend.
And I'm saying this knowing that Elena's
In the kitchen listening to my every word.
Look, I didn't know how real this was for you,
But I'm listening now.
Ok?
Elena, you can come in now. We're done.
Well, there is just way too much drama in this room.
So what do you guys wanna do?
I have an idea.
Why don't we have a seance
I don't think that's a good idea.
Come on. Let's summon some spirits.
This Emily chick has some serious explaining to do.
What are we doing?
I don't know.
Be quiet and concentrate.
Ok, close your eyes.
Ok, now take a deep breath.
Bonnie, call to her.
Emily...
You there?
Really? "Emily, you there?"
That's all you got?
Come on.
Fine. Jeez.
Emily...
I call on you.
I know you have a message.
I'm here to listen.
Did that just...
Yeah. That just happened.
It's just the air conditioning.
Ask her to show you a sign. Ask her.
Emily, if you're among us,
Show us another sign.
See? It's not working.
I can't. I'm done.
Get the light.
Please get the light.
Hold on. Hold on. I got it.
You guys,
The necklace, it's gone.
What are we doing in here?
Bonding. Catch.
Go on.
Give it a try.
Don't forget who taught you how to play this game.
Ow. That hurts.
Downside of my diet.
Getting hit actually hurts.
I'm impressed, Stefan.
Fun with booze and darts,
Sentimental with football,
And now starry night.
What do you want, Stefan?
Wasn't real, Damon.
Our love for Katherine.
Oh, god.
She compelled us. We didn't have a choice.
Took me years to sort that out,
To truly understand what she did to us.
Oh, no, Stefan.
We are not take in that on tonight.
What do you want with Katherine's crystal?
How do you know about that?
Come on. You knew Elena would tell me.
How did you know it was Katherine's?
Emily gave it to her on her last night.
I was with her. You weren't.
I was the last one to see her, Damon.
Now, what do you want with Katherine's crystal?
She didn't tell you?
We had other things on our mind.
I could rip your heart out and not think twice about it.
Yeah. I've heard that before.
I have a bigger surprise, Stefan.
I'm gonna bring her back.
Ok, fun's over, Caroline.
You made a point, and I get it.
Now give it back.
What?
Well, I didn't take it.
What? What happened?
I don't know. Nothing.
Jeremy, are you home?
Guys...
Oh, my god!
Open the door!
Bonnie!
Help me!
What's going on?
Bonnie! Bonnie!
Bonnie, try the other door.
I'll check the hallway.
Bonnie! Bonnie! Unlock the door!
Get me out!
Help me!
Bonnie!
Help!
Help me!
Bonnie! Open the...
Open the door!
What happened? Are you ok?
I'm fine.
Unbelievable.
You were totally faking it.
Caroline, come on.
No, you scared the hell out of me.
Bonnie?
I'm fine.
Everything's fine.
How can you bring Katherine back?
Before Katherine and the others were killed in the church,
You remember what it was like in this town?
Yeah, I remember the fear and the hysteria.
The townspeople were killing vampires one by one.
When they came for Katherine, I went straight to Emily,
Said, "I'll do anything. name your price."
"Just protect her."
She did.
How?
She did some kind of spell with the crystal.
And while the church was burning,
We thought Katherine was burning in it.
She wasn't.
But I...I saw her go inside.
There's a tomb underneath the church.
The spell sealed Katherine in that tomb, protecting her.
Are you telling me that Katherine's alive?
Well, if that's what you wanna call it.
She's been trapped in a mystical holding cell
For the last century and a half.
But you're an expert on a starving vampire,
So how do you think she's doin', stef?
Did you know that witches can use celestial events
To draw energy into their magic?
Pfft. Me either.
But in order to give the crystal its power,
Emily used the comet that was passing overhead,
And in order for that crystal to work again...
The comet had to return.
Downside...long time in between comets
And a couple of hiccups along the way with the crystal,
But the comet passed, and I got the crystal.
And then Caroline got the crystal,
And now Bonnie has the crystal,
And here we are.
Why would Emily...
Why would she do this for you?
Because she kwew they were gonna come for her, too,
And she made me promise that her lineage would survive.
I remember. You... you saved her children.
Yeah. It's the only thing keeping me
From ripping that little Bonnie girl's
Throat out to get my crystal back.
Oh, well. Deal's a deal.
So...
You wanna go throw some more?
I can't believe I fell for it.
Are you ok?
I must go.
She's leaving, I'm leaving.
You guys can't leave.
Oh, I can.
I've had enough
Freaky fake witch stuff for one night.
Thank you for having me.
I'll take it from here.
Where are you going?
Back to where it all began.
Bonnie.
Bonnie.
Oh, my god.
Emily!
I won't let him have it.
It must be destroyed.
Wait!
What's happening?
I don't know. The door, it's not...
What the hell?
I'm outta here.
What's wrong?
It's Bonnie.
What happened?
Emily is possessing her.
She said something.
What did she say?
She said, "I won't let him have it."
"It must be destroyed,"
And then she just left.
Ok. Where do you think she went?
I don't know.
Fell's church,
That's where she took Bonnie in her dreams.
We have to help her, Stefan.
All right. All right. Just stay there.
I'm gonna go and find her.
Hello, Emily.
You look different.
I won't let you do it.
We had a deal.
Things are different now.
I need to protect my family.
I protected your family.
You owe me.
I know.
I'm sorry.
You're about to be a lot more than that.
You're so wrong. I'm much more pathetic.
Oh, no, no, no. I've got you beat.
I have pathetic down to a science.
Uh, no. We haven't even covered high school.
Braces,
"A" cup.
Ah, glasses, skin condition.
You can, uh...
You know what? I'm not gonna invite you in.
Jeremy.
Well, some other time then.
Have a good night, Jenna.
So, uh, you found the boxes.
Yeah, I found this, too.
Me and Logan.
That's just cruel.
No, cruel is dating my history teacher.
I'm not dating him.
Yet.
This is why I feed on people.
Stefan.
Hello, Emily.
These people don't deserve this.
They should never have to know such evil.
What do you mean evil?
Emily, I swear to god I'll make you regret this.
I won't let you unleash them into this world.
Them?
What part of the story did you lelee out, Damon?
What does it matter?
Emily, tell me what you did.
To save her,
I had to save them.
You saved everyone in the church?
With one comes all.
I don't care about that. I just want Katherine.
I knew I shouldn't have believed a single
Word that comes out of your mouth.
This isn't about love, is it?
This is about revenge.
The two aren't mutually exclusive.
Damon, you can't do this.
Why not? They killed 27 people,
And they called it a war battle.
They deserve whatever they get.
27 vampires, Damon.
They were vampires.
You can't just bring them back.
This town deserves this.
You're blaming innocent people for something
That happened 145 years ago.
There is nothing innocent about these people,
And don't think for a second it won't happen again.
They already know too much,
And they'll burn your little grandwitch
Right next to us when they find out. Trust me.
Things are different now.
Don't do this.
I can't free them.
I won't.
Incendia!
No!
No. no.
No, please.
Bonnie!
No!
She's alive, but barely. I can save her.
Her neck,
It's healing.
God.
What are you doing here?
Uh, your window was open. I thought you should know.
Not funny.
Look, earlier today, I lied.
About?
About being in bed with you.
We cuddled, and it creeped me out.
It creeped you out?
I mean, did you just come over here to insult me or what?
Because it's been a really long night.
No, it's just that I... I don't like you.
I never have, but...
It was nice.
What?
Being in bed with you, it felt nice.
And so, I was thinking about it,
And I thought that I should tell you
I stayed the night because you were all sad and alone
And I felt bad for you.
Well, thank you,
'Cause I love being a charity case.
You can leave now.
No, because I know...
With Vicki gone and my mom off with Pete whoever,
It's just me, so...
I know.
Katherine never compelled me.
I knew everything every step of the way.
It was real for me.
I'll leave now.
I don't understand, Elena, what happened to me.
He attacked me, and...
His face was like...
How do you feel? Are you ok?
I'm fine.
It's... it's just this blood. I don't...
I'm not gonna hurt you.
What's going on, Elena?
I'll explain everything, Bonnie, ok?
Let's just get out of here.
Bonnie. Bonnie, look at me.
Trust me.
He's not going to hurt you.
Come on.
Come on.
Shh. Get in.
Is she in danger of becoming...
No. No, she has to die with my blood in her system,
So keep an eye on her tight
And make sure that nothing happens,
And once it leaves her system, she'll be fine.
I'm gonna tell her the truth.
You sure?
I can trust her.
I need someone to know, someone to talk to.
I can't live in secret.
I know.
Shouldn't have to.
You saved her life.
I'm sorry, Stefan. I thought that...
I couldn't be with you, but I can.
You don't have to push me away.
I can do this.
I can't.
I, uh... I have to leave, Elena.
Too many people have died.
Too much has happened.
What? No.
I know you think you're protecting me, but
I have to.
Coming home was...
It was a mistake.
I can't be a part of your life anymore.
Don't go, Stefan.
Please...
You don't have to. This is your home.
You...just please don't go.
Good-bye, Elena.
You're just gonna walk away?
Don't walk away, Stefan!
Stefan!
Hello, Jenna.
Logan.
