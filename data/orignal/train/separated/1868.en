The human body
is designed to compensate for loss.
It adapts,
so it no longer needs the thing it can't have.
Guess we should take the crib down.
Oh, no.
I'm just sorting through the clothes that Zola's grown out of
so I can give them away.
I mean, she's so big now,
when she comes back, she'll never fit into these.
We haven't heard anything in weeks.
Janet said it was gonna take a while,
and it's taking a while.
Just be patient.
Just fold these. It helps.
I don't know why, but it helps.
She's coming back.
But sometimes a loss is too great,
and the body can't compensate on its own.
That's when surgeons get involved.
Stop it.
I am making breakfast.
You don't cook.
I do...
sometimes.
Here.
Try these.
Eggs cooked
almost entirely with my left hand.
Teddy said, the best cardio surgeons
have two dominant hands.
It's like a superpower.
So I am in training.
Want some more?
You know, I think...
I think I want something else.
Oh, no.
That's my superpower. I only use one hand, too.
Hey. Where are you going?
Um, to visit Molly for two days.
Oh, that's great.
Jackson arranged it. It was a surprise.
Oh.
What do you mean by that?
Nothing.
Just oh.
'Cause it sounded like you meant,
"Really, he arranged for you to go visit your sister
at the exact time his mother's coming into town?
Guess he's not really that into you,
otherwise, he'd want you to meet his mother
like a normal person."
No. You had a mother.
Jackson and I had surgeons who procreated.
It's just a little complicated.
I-I-I shouldn't go, right?
No, I think it's sweet that he wants you
to get out of the line of fire.
That's my cab.
Yeah, I-I should stay.
I think you should probably get out while you have the chance.
Morning.
I'm in your O.R. today.
I can see that.
It's not gonna be a problem, is it?
No.
Good, good, 'cause, uh,
I was avoiding you,
and now I'm not.
See, I'm told you're dating a nurse
and kudos to you, 'cause who doesn't love a nurse, but...
I've been bringing lattes
to some dude in scheduling named Pierre
so he'd keep me out of your surgeries.
You know, I wanted to make it easier for you,
since you told me
you were being held together by tape and glue.
But now that you're being held together by a male nurse,
I'm gonna let Pierre go ahead and get his own lattes.
See you in surgery.
Hey, Miranda. You coming to dinner tonight?
Y-yeah.
And is it just you and Eli
or will Ben's butt be joining us, too?
Joking.
That was-- that's just a-a-
a joke.
I'll assume that it's just two for dinner,
and you can, uh--bye.
Hey, I saw the board.
Three islet device surgeries and a follow-up on Henry--
spreading it a little thin.
You concerned about me or your trial?
No, your trial.
Well, the way you're trying to micromanage me,
it seems like you still think it's yours.
Yeah, but Meredith Grey's stepping away from neuro.
I mean, she needs a new focus,
and you could use the help.
She's got a gift.
It's a gift, all right.
She could be a real asset.
The answer is no.
I can't believe Altman postponed our surgery
for grand rounds.
It's just a boring lecture.
Your husband said it was mandatory.
One more hour of sleep, that's what it is.
Oh, no. It's not gonna be boring.
This is Jackson's mother, Catherine Avery.
She's a urologist, right?
Yeah. I met her when I was an intern at Mercy West.
She's amazing.
She is...
a lunatic.
No, she's not. She's brilliant.
She says these things that shock you,
but then when you think about them later,
they change your whole life.
Or they ruin your whole life.
She's toxic. She's a meddler.
My mom has no boundaries. Be warned.
Hey, is that why you shipped Lexie out of state?
What? Oh. You shipped Lexie...
Wow.
Who hides his girlfriend under a rock
while his mom comes into town?
Someone who's got a hypercritical surgeon for a mom.
I get it.
Is your mom ambidextrous?
I bet you she is. All the best surgeons are.
Wait a second. How often do you talk to my mom?
We're facebook friends.
You're-- you and my mother?
She's a brilliant surgeon and woman.
She's a trailblazer.
And she's got a stalker.
Hey, you know what?
Just meet her. You'll see.
So do you want us to bring anything tonight?
Nope. I got it covered. Thanks.
What's tonight?
A dinner party.
Teddy and Henry's new place.
You're, um... you're not invited.
Why?
You're the babysitter.
Wake up, everybody.
I know, I know, it's grand rounds,
where we have to sit and listen to somebody
Talk about how somebody did something
and here's how they did it,
and there's not enough coffee in Brazil for this.
Well, not today.
Today we are going to do.
Today I'm going to change a life
and maybe make medical history, too.
And I can't do it alone,
so who wants to step into the future with me?
Whoo!
Okay. That's--that's all right. That's a start.
Let's see if I can get a few more.
Ryan, honey, would you come out here, please?
Everybody, this is Ryan.
Hi.
Ryan, could you show everybody
what we're here to do today?
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'd like to invite a few very lucky residents
to scrub in on this country's first...
Penis transplant.
Thanks to a case of penile cancer,
Ryan underwent a full penectomy 11 months ago.
Good margins left him basically cured
and cancer free
so that's gone.
And today we'll be replacing the other thing Ryan lost.
A suitable donor's become available
here at Seattle Grace Mercy West.
And Ryan generously agreed to fly out
and make this day a teaching opportunity.
Who wants in on it?
Hello! That's more like it.
Uh, Mark Sloan, plastics.
Isn't penile reconstruction
the standard approach in cases like these?
Why a-a transplant?
Well, I can answer your question with a question.
Do you like your penis?
Yes.
It does the job.
If one day, it wasn't there, wouldn't you want it back?
Or would you be satisfied with a reconstructed organ
that has very little function?
Satisfied? No. But that's not the--
Neither would Ryan here.
Yes, this is new ground.
But here's a young man with his whole life ahead of him,
with the will to live it as a whole man,
With a bravery and selflessness to
help advance medical science along the way.
So let's give Ryan a hand.
Come on!
And now let's give Ryan a penis!
Yes!
Yeah! Go ahead!
So nice to see you again, too, really.
Thank you. Thank you.
Gotta make a big show out of everything.
There's my baby boy.
Hi, Mom.
Come here.
You look skinny.
You're not sleeping.
Okay, I'm fine, Mom.
Which one is she?
She's a brunette, right?
We're not doing this today, okay?
Oh, maybe the real question is,
what kind of name is Lexie?
I never told you her name.
I have my ways.
Where is she?
She's not here. She's out of town.
I come into town, and you smuggle her across state lines?
Are you ashamed of her?
Dr. Avery, sorry to interrupt.
Oh, interrupt, please.
Oh, Mark Sloan, plastics. The man who doubts.
Listen, I'm all for standing up for the Johnson,
but this is a transplant,
and transplant patients reject organs.
Now I see a 28-year-old guy
who could have a pretty good life
with a reconstructed organ
that my boy here and I could make tomorrow.
Excuse me.
You're working with Jackson?
I'm mentoring him. He didn't mention it?
No, he didn't.
Got a great set of hands, this kid. You should be proud.
Why don't you scrub in with me?
And you can tell me all the reasons why.
I'll be there.
All right.
Can't you just stay out of it?
He's your mentor. Why not get to know the man?
At least he didn't skip town.
All right.
No, I said I'm not competing.
Come on. It's gonna be the
microsurgery olympics in there.
You're gonna kill it.
Exactly, and then I'm stuck in the O.R.
with my mom for 12 hours?
Forget it.
Man up.
This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
This kind of thing will look good on your boards.
Now get in there and make me proud.
Who has worked with the tissue of the penis before?
Kepner, keep your hand down.
Shh.
Its delicate vascularity
demands a grace and elegance
that not many surgeons of your station
have mastered.
The two surgeons to do the best end-to-end anastomosis
of their chicken's femoral vessels
will scrub in with me,
So be cautious,
be careful,
be brilliant.
Begin!
Yes! You-- you have no idea how--
No.
Sorry, sweetie. You're too tense.
You're all wound up.
This isn't woodshop.
Step to the back.
You need to lay off the lattes, dear.
Your left hand is shaking like a motel bedspring.
It's--it's just tired.
I hear you, honey. Aren't we all?
Step to the back.
It's very simple, people.
All it has to be is perfect.
Okay, last stitch.
Can I have the dressing, please?
Pretty snappy, huh?
It goes fast,
like magic.
Magic.
Okay, can I have the chart?
Uh, is there a problem?
Not that I'm aware of.
Because I'm doing my best to be pleasant,
but I don't owe you an explanation for the fact
that I happen to be...
sleeping with a nurse,
I believe, is what you're looking for.
You and I broke up.
You basically told me to wait for you.
What? I-I did no such thing.
No, but you did.
You said it was too much.
Something horrible had just happened,
you were traumatized,
you couldn't handle a relationship.
It wasn't me. It was you.
Okay, now that is not fair and--
And, look, I still can't handle a relationship--
The kind of thing that you and I were considering--
Becau--
The--what I'm doing right now is--is nothing like that.
Then what is it?
If you have a problem working with me,
take it up with Pierre.
Excellent.
Very fine work, doctor...
Grey.
As in Lexie Grey?
Oh, she's my sister.
Oh.
Come on. Not now.
I gotta...
I'm out.
Hey, he forfeits, right?
He... he walked out.
Congratulations. We have our winners.
Uh, he's your son, and you're the judge.
Isn't there some rule against that?
I don't play favorites, dear.
Nepotism is for the weak.
That's what my birthday cards always said.
What the hell happened?
I don't know.
Does anybody else know about this?
I don't think so.
She had a seizure.
Now it's gonna be big, right?
Chad.
What? I'm just sayin',
maybe you could be trading up, you know?
Have you seen it?
The donor organ? Yes.
How's it measure up? It's nothing to be embarrassed about?
Chad, shut up.
I'm just sayin',
my little brother's a good-lookin' kid.
He's gonna need--
He's gonna be happy with it.
And it's gonna work?
Not just the plumbing,
it'll stand up and report for duty?
Chad, I swear to God.
That's the point of doing a transplant--
To hopefully restore full urinary and sexual function.
If you're worried,
there's always penile reconstruction.
It's less risky.
I saw the signs for months before I saw a doctor.
By the time I finally saw someone,
they tell me it's cancer,
it's too far gone, and I have to lose it.
I'm tired of, every time I look down,
being reminded of what a coward I am.
This feels like a second chance,
And like she says,
if you can learn something from me
that might help out the next guy,
then I can feel pretty good about that, too.
Okay.
See you in surgery.
Temp's 103.
Abdomen's tender and distended.
Her foster mother said Zola was running a fever.
She's been crying all day. They couldn't get her to stop.
High-pitched bowel sounds. Call C.T.
Yeah, and I'm gonna page, uh, Grey and Shepherd.
You can't do that.
What? The kid's sick.
Their custody was suspended.
I know they're your friends, but at this moment,
they're nothing more than a third party.
It's a breach of confidentiality.
They're right here.
Their custody is under investigation.
The last thing any of us needs is a breach of protocol.
It could jeopardize the adoption.
Okay, okay, little Miss munchkin.
You're gonna feel a little bit of a sting,
and then I'm gonna be all done.
Very impressive in the skills lab, Meredith.
What are you specializing in?
Oh, um,
I was thinking about neuro,
but I'm making a change.
Jackson had a chance to be on neuro,
but he turned it down to follow me into plastics.
You had an opportunity to work with Derek Shepherd
and you turned it down...
For plastics?
Jackson Avery, who raised
you when I wasn't looking?
Mom, let's not--
I'm standing right here.
I know, honey,
but this isn't about you.
This is about this boy and, oh...
And here he is, the man of the hour.
Chad, honey,
this is as far as you can go.
Buddy, as soon as this is over,
I'm gonna take you to test drive that thing
in every strip club on Long Island.
Okay, Chad, stop.
For the past year, all we've talked about is this.
I miss talking about the Knicks.
Tell me this is gonna work
so I can have my brother back.
It's gonna work.
I'm gonna go harvest the organ right now.
I'll see you in the O.R.
When this is over,
you can never mention my penis again.
Promise.
All right.
All right, buddy.
Freakin' hell.
That's a pretty nasty bowel obstruction.
Are you on your own with that?
No. Uh, Robbins.
Good.
Thank you so much for letting me help you with this.
I mean, how often do you get to harvest a penis?
Well, I thought it would give us a chance to catch up.
Take this, dear.
Okay, here we go...
like millions of angry wives have dreamed of.
Except we'll start with an artistic,
elliptical incision.
So how's it going, honey?
Oh, you know, it's fifth year,
and chief resident is like 20 jobs in one,
and on top of that, I've got boards coming up
and surgeries to log--
So much to get done.
So when are you going to have sex with a man?
When are you gonna get that done?
I'm s--
I'm s--I'm sorry. What?
Look, I don't know or care why you're waiting, dear.
But unless you have a good reason, I say do it.
You're all wound up.
It'll get you unwound.
It'll make you a better surgeon.
Oh, that's a nice dorsal vein.
Yeah. Easy to graft.
Is it really that obvious?
You keep looking at this thing like it's gonna bite you.
I...
Catherine Avery.
Richard Webber.
Shame on you.
I send you my son to educate,
and you let him wander off into plastics.
Well, he seems happy.
Happiness is for ordinary people.
He's my son. Greatness is his legacy.
At a certain point, you have to realize
that you've done everything you can.
You can't force people to do things they don't want to do.
Don't I know it.
When was it that we met at that convention in Miami,
and I just flirted with you shamelessly,
and you had to tell me you were married?
I remember.
Are you still married?
'Cause after this surgery tonight,
I'm gonna need some dinner.
I'm still married.
Damn it.
Well, there's always next time.
Yeah.
You know I don't give up.
Have a good surgery.
Thanks, Richard.
You're welcome.
What?
I was about to do an art line with my left hand.
Zola's got a bowel obstruction.
We have to operate.
W-what? Where's Mer?
She can't know. Neither can Derek.
I mean, they get involved, and social services flips out,
the adoption's shot.
Well, is she stable?
For the moment.
And that's the right call, right? We don't tell 'em.
You just told me it was.
But I'm right. Right?
It'll blow the adoption? Yeah, we can't tell them.
Okay. All right. That's your decision.
Hey, you just called me down here
so I could take responsibility for your decision?
How small are your balls?
Meredith didn't talk to me for weeks
because I screwed up her life.
The balls are pretty small right now.
Dr. Karev.
The baby's seizing again.
Page--page Robbins!
We're tellin' Mer!
You bet your ass, we are.
All right, my dears.
What do you say we get to anastomosing
these deep dorsal vessels?
Suction.
Dr. Grey, easy on the suction, hon.
Lighter touch.
Like that?
That's perfect.
Hmm. Dr. Grey,
seems you've inherited the hands of your mother.
Thank you.
Did your sister Lexie inherit the same skills?
Dr. Avery.
I'm my mother's only child.
Lexie and I are half sisters.
Sounds like someone picked the wrong Grey.
Ma--
Lexie is very talented. She's brilliant.
Lexie's great. Great surgeon. Great girl.
Sorry. Excuse me.
Sorry. Sorry.
What is all the bustling, please?
I'm sorry to interrupt. I need to speak with Dr. Grey.
Dr. Grey is busy making history right now.
Suction, please.
Meredith.
Meredith.
I a--I'm-- I'm sorry, Dr. Avery.
I'm sorry.
For the love of God.
Ellis grey is rolling in her grave right now.
Who wants to take Dr. Grey's place?
Dr. Kepner.
Yes!
Excuse me. Excuse me! I have to scrub.
We're just doing a standard workup today,
and if your blood's clean, you're a free man.
Do I have to wait for the labs or can you call me?
Oh, we'll call you.
Good, because I'm marinating the fish for tonight,
and if it stays in that thing for too long,
it just turns into mush.
What? You don't like fish?
I do.
You don't like fish?
I like fish.
Good. Okay, wow.
I probably should've checked earlier,
but I'm new to this whole dinner party thing, so...
What's happening right now?
Henry and Teddy are having a dinner party tonight.
So I gather.
Yeah, and we're invited.
Yeah, I got that, too.
Is there a problem?
I forgot to tell him.
It's a good thing Henry came by and brought up the marinade.
That's not a very masculine topic--marinade.
I should've cooked beef.
Are you free?
I am.
I mean, 'cause, you know, you don't have to come.
Wow. Best invite ever.
I'm s--
Okay.
This is my, um, bad.
It could be my bad. I mean--
Yeah. You both suck.
See you at dinner.
Dr. Avery, thank you so much for bringing me in.
This is so exciting.
Uh-huh. Relax, honey, relax.
Suction, please.
Lightly. Lightly.
And that, ladies and gentlemen,
completes the work on this dorsal artery.
Everybody, stretch, shake out your hands,
take a breather.
Your technique has improved, baby.
Thanks.
It's easy to teach when there's natural ability to work with.
Your boy's born for plastics.
That might be so, but, you know,
you gotta be careful with that easy road.
A person can get used to taking the easy road,
and next thing they know, they find themselves...
the bo-job king of Seattle,
a tummy-tuck tycoon.
I don't think that's fair.
More irrigation and suction.
Are you saying there isn't easy money in plastics, Dr. Sloan?
Are you saying there's no valuable work to be done there?
She's saying I don't have the discipline to resist the easy money.
I'm just saying, there's a temptation.
Gently, April.
Yeah, well,
maybe if you knew a little more about me,
you'd know that I'm incredibly disciplined.
And I'm not a tummy-tuck tycoon.
I'm sorry about that, Dr. Sloan.
She's obviously tr--
Don't apologize for me.
Yeah, well, somebody needs to...
Suction, April....
'cause you're way out of line.
Right near the dorsal vein.
I chose plastics.
Right here?
I pursued Dr. Sloan. These are my choices.
I'm not gonna sit here and let you trash them
because they're not the same choices you would've made.
Back off.
You back off.
Not you, the suction. April.
Oh, god. The vein is stuck.
Oh, what--what--what do I do?
All right, shut off the suction now!
Don't move. It's shredding.
She's mangling it.
Oh, my God. It's not stopping.
Oh, oh... oh, no.
Oh, god.
What did I do?
You destroyed my dorsal vein.
Is it her shunt? Is it hydrocephalus?
What the hell were you thinking?
That was her C.T. before, wasn't it?
I'm sorry. I couldn't tell you.
You still can't.
The hell he can't. She's my patient.
Oh, thank God. Owen, I--
Look, look, Robbins told me what is going on,
and she is right. You can't see Zola.
Owen, stay out of it.
She's probably terrified,
and someone should be with her.
She's sedated.
She's not alone.
I have a herd of nurses on a rotating schedule,
holding her, singing her.
We've got this.
Did you try an N.G. tube?
The bowels are compressing the V.P. shunt,
and she's hypotensive, so we're taking her to the O.R.
Well, then I'm in there.
Shepherd, you can't.
I inserted the shunt. It's part of the problem.
I should fix it!
Are you out of your mind?
The adoption lady's watching her like a hawk.
They're looking for a reason to ding you.
Where is she?
I will page you the minute that we're done.
I'll have Karev give you ours...
Karev,
look at me.
Where is she?
Pre-op. 16-08.
Thank you. I'm going there.
Shepherd, don't.
Derek.
Back off, Hunt.
Derek, don't do this.
You know how long the shunt...
Derek, Shepherd...
had to have been malfunctioning
You are making--
for her bowels to have gotten this bad?!
You are making a mistake!
They didn'know what to look for.
Exactly, because she should've been with us.
And she's not, and that's my fault.
And I may never sleep another night again because of that,
but if there's a prayer of us getting her back,
we have to just dot our I's and cross our T's,
not mess with the rules.
Arizona is a great surgeon.
Please don't make it worse.
What is your plan on fixing this?
It's just kinked.
Once I get in there, and I remove the adhesions
and I fix the obstruction, the shunt will be fine.
If it's not?
What if it's disconnected or broken?
Then I convert to a V.A. shunt.
Derek, I can do this.
Let me do this.
I just left O.R. Two.
They've started.
Thanks.
I know I should be with Meredith.
I see her pain, but I can't.
I can barely look at her.
This is all her fault.
Every time I think I've moved on,
I've started to forgive her,
something else comes up, and I'm right back where I was.
You know, Cristina and I, we just...
we just went through something,
and I know how you feel.
It's not easy.
You know, they don't make it easy.
No.
Did you hear that Zola came to the hospital,
had a bowel obstruction?
Yep.
Can't be easy on Meredith.
Can't be easy at all.
You are not
really using Meredith's sick baby
to guilt me into putting her on my trial.
Well, if you think she lacks judgment, then help her.
You're the moral compass of this hospital.
Mor...
You don't e...
I'm the moral compass of nothing.
I am using one man like a plaything
and had another one bribing a scheduler.
Yeah, I really don't want to know about...
Like a plaything...
often...
and enthusiastically.
M-may-maybe you should stop.
Did I mention that I promised Ellis Grey...
on her death bed that
I would take care of Meredith?
I am still not putting that girl on my trial.
I am so sorry, Dr. Avery.
You gave me one job-- suction.
I mean, what kind of a person ruins an entire sur...
Dr. Kepner, stop talking, now.
Okay, new game plan.
We harvest the saphenous vein from his leg
and use it as extension tubing.
If we used a deep inferior epigastric perforator flap,
we wouldn't need to cut into his leg.
I'm not familiar with that technique.
It's been used recently in genital reconstruction surgeries.
I've seen him do it. The results have been amazing.
More natural looking, ages better,
there'd be no visible scaring,
less post-op pain, fewer post-op complications.
You want me to go on?
I'm not gonna risk Ryan's penile function
because I bruised your ego.
I'm not trying impress you.
Let me do this, and that'll come naturally.
Come on, Dr. Avery.
Step into the future with me.
Well, if you feel comfortable doing it--
Hell, I feel comfortable letting your kid do it.
Avery, prep the abdomen.
I'm on it.
So Alex was supposed to call by now.
Yeah. In, like, ten minutes.
Do you think it's bad if we call him?
Yep.
What if she--
She's not gonna die.
Do you hear me?
All right.
Do you know how to do single-handed left-handed ties?
No.
Try it.
Like that?
Did you just do that on your first try?
Yeah.
Well, you are holding your string too tight--
Oh, oh, shut up.
Got a message from Karev.
They had to resect a small part of the bowel,
but everything else looks good so far.
Oh, thank God.
Did you ju--
Oh, I hate you people.
Don't touch it.
You know, I really don't get you.
You should understand better than anyone.
What if it was Sofia?
Do you have any parental rights?
If something happens to her,
Sloan and Torres aren't around,
you got some peds doc
saying you don't have a right to see her.
Mind your own business, Karev.
I'm sorry. I'm just sayin', it sucks.
No, here's what sucks--
Zola's gonna be fine because we're awesome surgeons,
and if Meredith and Derek didn't know that she was here,
Zola would still be fine,
the adoption wouldn't be in jeopardy,
and they wouldn't be in a room somewhere
going out their minds imagining the worst.
All right. Good anastomosis, Dr. Avery.
Perfect flap.
Thank you.
And Mrs. Dr. Avery,
here is your brand-new dorsal vein.
Impressive, no?
If it actually works.
I mean, right now all we've got is a sad
old gray penis with a piece of belly in it.
Dr. Kepner, release the clamp.
Uh, maybe you should do it--
Shh. Girl, get in there.
Yep. Pinker.
Oh, that is pinker.
Well, I don't know about you.
But I'd say that's just about
the pinkest penis I've ever seen.
We were able to remove all of the adhesions
and get the shunt working again.
We'll monitor her while she's here.
She's gonna be fine.
I'll stay with Zola tonight.
Okay.
I will call if there's anything to worry about.
So don't call every five minutes.
You guys go home.
Okay.
Do I have to set a place for Eli?
Because I hear that you forgot to invite him.
Why do people forget to invite people to dinner parties?
Is that a trick question?
I need to break up with him.
Oh, oh, please don't do it at my party.
See, the last time I broke up with a man,
he thought I was asking him to wait for me.
And then he did, apparently,
and he bought lattes for a man named Pierre.
Is that slang for something that I don't know about?
See, I try to preserve the dignity of others,
and that's the problem.
And I'm poetic, which, you know,
I like to think provides clarity,
but in fact may simply cloud the message.
All right. Here's what I do.
Use short, declarative sentences.
I'm ending this. All the best to you.
Got it?
Oh, and--and do it before the party.
D--no. Not before.
No, uh... tomorrow.
Before is rude.
Before is depriving the man of a meal,
which he's now excited about
because your husband couldn't shut up about the sauce.
I have to serve dinner to a dead man walking?
Oh, buck up. You can handle it.
I...
I just need a second.
Take all the time you need.
It's like Christmas friggin' morning, dude.
I will shut up.
Okay. I'm ready.
There's quite a bit of swelling,
but that will go down.
And it'll do everything it's supposed to.
It's great.
Thank you.
You want to see? I'll give you one last look.
I'm good, bro.
I'm happy if you're happy.
That is great.
Clean wound.
You'll have a scar, but who cares?
It'll make you look fierce.
Hey, you know, you should, uh, you should go to the party.
Oh, I have to finish this.
Plus, I thought I'd keep you company.
You know, I've been practicing this all day.
And your parents,
they can do single-handed left-handed ties with their eyes closed,
never mind closing a tube of cream.
Your dad...
is a rock star.
He is a household name.
And your mom? She's a natural.
People say that she got it from her mom.
So you're gonna get it, too.
You'll watch her resect tumors all the time,
and when you slice open your first abdomen,
people will say...
"Oh, my goodness. How did she learn that so fast? Huh?
How did she learn that so fast?"
And you'll say,
"Oh, I come from a long, long line of surgeons."
You know, you're right.
I'm... I'm gonna head to that party.
Oh, okay.
Okay, bye.
Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.
Hey.
Hey.
Okay, I'm sorry.
Uh... I can't do this.
Uh, I-I need to say something to you,
and I want to make sure that I'm clear,
because I...
A-apparently have been unclear in the past.
You're ending this.
Whatever this is, it's ending.
Yes.
You're perfectly clear.
You're the clearest person I've ever known.
You do not have a clarity problem.
I-I don't?
No. No.
You've been telling me
you don't want a relationship every day for weeks now.
And I've been ignoring you because you're...
different than any woman I've ever known.
So that's my fault.
I should've walked away a long time ago.
I can blame you for many things,
but a lack of clarity... is not one of them.
I'm...
I'm sorry.
Enjoy the party.
My son tells me that I have trouble admitting when I'm wrong.
So this would be the place where I should say
that was an impressive save.
Of course it was.
He's a good kid.
Probably 'cause you've given him such a complex,
but for whatever the reason,
let him find his own way.
He'll do good.
Thank you.
Oh, and...
don't count out Lexie Grey till you meet her.
She's smart, she's beautiful...
She's perfect.
A guy couldn't do any better.
Dr. Bailey.
Dr. Warren.
Um... look,
Y-you're gonna hear about something
because everyone around here hears about everything.
Eli and I have ended things...
The nurse.
You're gonna think that it has something to do with you,
and for the sake of clarity,
I would like to be extremely clear
when I say it doesn't have anything to do with you...
At all.
Are we clear?
It doesn't have anything to do with you.
Ben Warren...
I am being...
very clear with you.
Are you listening to me?
Night, Miranda bailey.
I'll see you tomorrow.
No. That is not what I said.
Benjamin Warren!
I am so sorry for suctioning that vein.
I-I don't know...
April...
what happened.
Stop apologizing.
Would you let it go? It's all worked out.
Yeah. Honey, you gotta learn how to relax.
You're making a good day feel bad.
Hey.
I just wanted to thank you for the drink.
It was really nice.
I don't... um, I'm...
I-I think that you may have...
I think he has the drink that you sent him.
And this is the part where you get up
and go and play darts with him.
Why are you such a meddler?
I'm using my powers for good.
Cheers.
Oh, did you try one of these spinach things?
Oh, they're fantastic.
Is Cristina coming?
Oh, excuse me. She can't. Sends her apologies.
Well, this many doctors,
and only three of you got stood up?
That's not bad.
Hey.
Mine's here.
How's Zola doing?
Great. She's amazing.
So is Eli just gonna be late or...
Nope.
Stuck at the hospital.
That dress looks great on you.
I picked it out. Hot, right?
Can we talk?
Um, listen, I want a piece of paper
that says that Sofia's mine.
We always say that we're gonna do it,
but we never actually do it.
Then let's do it.
Because she's mine. She's my baby.
I mean, she's yours and she's Mark's,
but sh-she's mine, too.
I mean, I'm the only one that can get her to go back to sleep
in the middle of the night.
I know.
And she calls me Mama.
And I know that it sounds like it's babbling,
but she's-- she's saying it to me
because I'm-I'm her mama.
I know you are.
We'll get you that piece of paper, okay? I promise.
Okay.
Okay. Come here.
It's okay.
Tell me about plastics.
Mom, come on. I'm tired.
And I don't want to spend all night
trying to convince you it's a legitimate specialty.
I'm asking you to share your interests.
Or you can tell me about this girl
you shipped off to another time zone
in honor of my arrival.
Can you blame me? Honestly?
I mean, look how you were all over Sloan. I mean...
Sloan can take it.
You're saying this Lexie can't?
I like her.
A lot. I don't want to start this.
I'm gonna meddle one more time.
Yeah. See, if only I could believe that,
maybe we could talk...
Sloan...
be careful of him,
if you really like her.
Why?
Because he talks about her
the way you should, that's why.
Yeah. They were a thing.
That's over now.
Are you in love with her?
We're not gonna talk about this.
Ayiee!
We're so hopeful at the beginning of things.
It seems like there's only a world to be gained...
Not lost.
That's her.
Hello.
Hey. You ready?
Yeah.
Okay, go.
Hi, baby girl.
Is aunt Cristina getting ready to put you to bed?
We love you.
Hey, Zo.
Ready to close your eyes?
Yeah?
The itsy bitsy spider
Went up the water spout
Down came the rain
And washed the spider out
Out came the sun
And dried up all the rain
And the itsy bitsy spider
Went up the spout again
They say the inability to accept loss
is a form of insanity.
We love you.
Good night.
It's probably true.
But sometimes...
