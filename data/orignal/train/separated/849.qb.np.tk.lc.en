that schmidt &apos;s ... on a plane .

mom ?
schmidt &apos;s on a plane ?
mom , what are you doing here ?
if you &apos;ve come to object to this wedding ,
you are too late ,
and in another sense ,
because it &apos;s delayed ,
you &apos;re ... too early .
that &apos;s not at all why i &apos;m here .
mama p. schmidt with the latest ,
&quot; why i love cece . &quot; today &apos;s episode :
honesty with a capital ouch .
he called you ?
every monday for the past year .
your daughter is the best thing ...
i just lost a fight in the desert , but ...
and i want her to be the last thing i see
when she pulls the plug .
but it &apos;s not an a @-@ plus
unless we both finish .
she &apos;s so beautiful .
the odds are really stacked against our children .
they &apos;re not all winners .
i just know that if you miss your daughter &apos;s wedding ,
you &apos;re going to regret it for the rest of your life .
i am delighted
for you to marry this man .
for those keeping score with row five ,
cece &apos;s mom is at the wedding !
just get here when you can , okay ?
we &apos;ll wait until you do .
you know what ? have the party without me .
babe . no . okay , no .
have the party . we &apos;ll ...
we &apos;ll get married at city hall with all the immigrants
and liberals and first cousins .
your whole life has been about this party .
my whole life is you .
plus , my cousin nathan is just dying for something to go wrong .
i &apos;m so happy .
i have an idea .
conga !
whoa , whoa , running out of room here .
let &apos;s back it up .
shut up .
winston , you don &apos;t have to prank the wedding anymore .
okay , cool , cool , cool .
you know , fyi , i was gonna go with a simple , classic streak .
cece &apos;s mom showed up . come out to the party .
oh ! no ! oh ! oh !
oh ! oh , no !
no ! no !
sounds like you &apos;re under water .
as we all know , marriage is about sex and property .
everybody say that with me once .
marriage is about s ...
i imagined that differently .
you &apos;re okay . you &apos;re okay . pull it together .
just let the index cards go .
speak from the heart .
you know who i &apos;m talking to when i say
you were rude to me earlier at the bar .
and now who &apos;s in control ? i could point to you
and call you out , but i won &apos;t .
when i first met this guy ,
schmidt , i thought , &quot; i &apos;m not gonna be friends with him .
i don &apos;t like his personality . &quot;
magic &apos;s fake .
believe what you want ,
but i want you guys to think about something ,
and now this is off the jack .
in a couple generations ,
we &apos;re all gonna be dead ,
and no one &apos;s gonna remember any of us .
i mean , think about it . do you remember
your great @-@ great grandparents or ...
or their parents , or what they did day to day ?
the point is , it doesn &apos;t matter .
everyone you know will be dead .
that &apos;s right .
congratulations , man . i love you .
best friends .
that &apos;s my time , everybody . thank you .
look , if it made sense , it wouldn &apos;t be my wedding .
your speech wasn &apos;t that bad .
my speech was fantastic .
it &apos;s the best 17 minutes of my life .
i really opened up my heart .
i was gonna say .
nah , i &apos;m just feeling bad about reagan .
i think i came on too strong , or @-@ or ...
i don &apos;t know . she told me she &apos;s leaving tonight on a train .
on a train ? where &apos;s she going , hogwarts ?
no , san diego .
i don &apos;t know if &quot; hog @-@ warts &quot; is near san diego .
i &apos;ve never heard of it .
never mind .
but , i mean , it &apos;s okay . i just , i feel like i , you know ...
i just got excited for a second .
nick , she came here to see you .
i bet you &apos;re reading into it . what if i go talk to her ?
talk me up a little bit ?
woman to woman ?
that &apos;s implied .
winston .
no hay weenstons . it &apos;s ocupados .
winston , i know you &apos;re in there
&apos;cause i &apos;m looking at a picture of your butt cheeks right now .
oh , that &apos;s a working class butt .
nothing wrong with that !
give me ...
give me those .
that &apos;s a fatty . you got a fatty .
this is not winnie &apos;s day .
ernie , give him your jacket .
what ?
give me the damn jacket .
all right , here , dude .
i jabbed my giblets in the breast pocket .
tie it around your waist .
then that leaves the front porch open or the back .
i don &apos;t think this is gonna work .
i &apos;ll just sit here cold and naked
while my best friend gets married .
look , you were right , coach .
i &apos;m not a serious man . i &apos;m a nude ,
apple bottom , long @-@ fronted dumb @-@ ass .
ooh , look . at least you can change the background . look .
now i &apos;m in the oval office . that &apos;s crazy .
winston , you &apos;re a groomsman and a bridesman .
it doesn &apos;t get more serious than that .
you can &apos;t miss this wedding .
but what am i supposed to wear ?
i am looking for the groom .
schmidt . what &apos;s up , man ?
i know i &apos;m wearing a photo booth curtain right now .
that does not take away from how incredibly happy i am
for the both of you .
thank you .
winston , i &apos;m going to get off this plane soon .
oh , dear lord ! winston !
pick it up !
don &apos;t squat !
so , i mean ,
i feel like i really put myself out there , right ?
i got on a plane , and i flew across the country to see him .
i couldn &apos;t get him out of my head , you know ?
yeah . yeah .
and then he says the word &quot; relationship , &quot;
and i freaked out , because ...
you know what , i don &apos;t know .
am i crazy to want a relationship with nick ?
i mean , you guys were together . what happened ?
we were kind of a mess .
i wanted him to have a plan for his life
and not keep his money in a box in his closet .
and ... he wanted me
to not care about those things .
that &apos;s not so bad . i mean ,
who really has a plan for their life ?
who does that ?
me .
me . i d ... i did it .
i do it .
i &apos;m sure there are plenty of guys
out there who keep a very traditional banking account .
yeah .
there are . and i just dated one of &apos; em .
and i ...
i don &apos;t think any of that stuff matters .
thank you .
you are awesome .
thanks .
i &apos;m gonna go do this .
* yesterday my life *
* my life was bright and sunny *
* today i feel just like a bee *
* that lost all its honey *
* girl , it &apos;s written all over your face *
* someone else has taken my place *
* girl if this is true ... *
i ...
yeah , i know .
you don &apos;t have to say it .
cece ,
schmidt wants to talk to you .
babe , the plane &apos;s moving .
maybe they &apos;re going back to the gate . maybe i can get there
before they release the monarch butterflies .
oh , my god , that is so great , babe !
ladies and gentlemen , we are finally bound for portland .
aah ! no !
what are you guys doing here ?
it &apos;s the middle of the night .
ow ! winston !
the hell is wrong with you ?
we use that stuff to revive passed @-@ out derelicts .
come on , buddy . we got to get you ready .
what ?
you already sprayed that .
yes ...
you don &apos;t have to spray it again .
honestly , dude , you &apos;re ruining it .
relax .
you want to get married ?
i don &apos;t think that i can wait another second .
* i &apos;ve been thinking &apos; bout tomorrow *
* instead of drowning in the past *
* we had good times even back when *
* dreams were all we had to last *
* so as i wake up ... *
may this couple be blessed
and be helpful to one another in all ways .
just when i thought you couldn &apos;t make me any happier ,
look what you did today .
you &apos;re amazing .
i hope for as long as we stay together ,
that i always remain someone that
you want to hollah at .
i look forward to a lifetime of joy , growth
and constant mispronunciation
of common words .
for the first time ,
i see what the rest of my life looks like .
i now pronounce you
husband and ...
oh , wait , uh , we need the glass .

i don &apos;t know what you said to reagan ,
but i want to say thank you ,
because she wants to go for it with me .
she wants to do this .
well , that &apos;s awesome . congratulations .
yeah , i &apos;m freaking out . i can &apos;t believe it .
i mean , why does she want to be with me ?
it doesn &apos;t make any sense .
you of all people
know that i &apos;m just the weird detour you take
before you find the guy you want to be with .
i basically just help women realize
that they could do a lot better ...
stop it , nick !
i &apos;m tired of you
being the only person
who doesn &apos;t see how incredible you are .
okay .
i &apos;m , uh , i &apos;m incredible .
yes , you &apos;re incredible .
all right , thanks .
all right , i &apos;m booking a ticket .

for work for three months
and she asked me to go with her ,
and ... i &apos;m gonna do it .
don &apos;t make this about you !
get in line and hora !
all right , let &apos;s do it .
so nice of your mom to get us this trip .
