looking for this .
i &apos;ll scream .
don &apos;t . listen to me . reddington knows where i am .
he found me , and he is coming here ,
but you need to know that you can &apos;t trust him .
he is using you .
and when berlin is dead , he will kill you .
if you &apos;re trying to help me , why don &apos;t you put the gun down ?
has he told you ?
has he told you anything about that night , about the fire ?
you need to ask him , liz , for the truth
about why he turned himself in to the fbi .
no .
it &apos;s not what you think .
you should have killed him when you had the chance .
go ahead and ask him , liz .
you should have finished it .
make him answer . you deserve to know the truth .
your father , naomi hyland --
red doesn &apos;t want you to know that that night ,
the night of the fire --
what do you want , agent keen ?
what do you really want ?
who are you ? !
i &apos;ve seen you following me .
you &apos;ve seen me at the millbrook . i &apos;m staying there , too .
i was just -- i was just going to the gym .
open up your bag .
open up your bag . open it up .
what the hell are you doing ?
who are you ?
i &apos;m sorry .
the indonesian government has finally agreed
to turn over all day @-@ to @-@ day operations at the port
to a private company .
i &apos;d like that company to be operated by the syndicate .
that &apos;s unlikely .
our logistics company in the region is too small .
i agree . so i &apos;ve taken steps to change that .
i &apos;m tripling our investment .
and what if we don &apos;t get the contract ?
you &apos;re fighting a war with berlin
that drags all of us into the trenches with you .
this is a time for caution , not risk .
the fruit is ripe .
niko , i &apos;ve made my decision .
the men behind you will take you to your car .
where &apos;s naomi hyland ?
you know , it &apos;s hard to say .
i &apos;ve never been great at reading that woman &apos;s emotions .
i need to talk to her .
you want to talk to her --
perhaps some lingering personal questions
you think my ex @-@ wife can answer .
you &apos;re hiding her from me .
what do you know about paul wyatt ?
same as everyone else , i guess .
he ran an investment firm
but was being investigated by the s.e.c. for fraud .
he was stealing life savings and pensions .
only to turn up with his heart ripped from his chest .
probably by one of his clients .
police say that whoever did it was trying to make a point .
oh , well , as much as i admire the police
for their wonderful sense of irony ,
i &apos;m afraid they &apos;ve got this one wrong .
the man who killed paul wyatt wasn &apos;t trying to make a point .
he was trying to make a sale .
his name is dr. james covington .
a few years ago , he was considered
one of the top cardiothoracic surgeons in the country .
now he runs an illegal organ @-@ transplant ring .
his operation , if you &apos;ll indulge the term ,
is one @-@ stop shopping for anyone
who needs a life @-@ saving organ transplant
but who can &apos;t or doesn &apos;t want
to go through conventional channels ...
my name is oliver fleck .
i represent dr. james covington .
that includes criminals and wealthy clients
who don &apos;t happen to be first in line on the recipient list .
so , where do the organs come from ?
oh , that &apos;s not your concern .
what matters is that we do our very best
to ensure their quality .
if there are complications within the first 10 years ,
we make every effort to rectify them .
he &apos;s harvesting organs --
killing innocent people to sell off their parts ?
lizzy , some of the worst of the worst are still alive
because dr. covington is saving them .
and you know how to find him ?
no . slushie ?
pass .
oh , my gosh . you have no idea what you &apos;re missing .
try a grapefruit gusher .
it &apos;s just like you today -- a little sour .
two grapefruit .
mr. reddington was right .
covington was once a respected surgeon --
got his m.d. at yale ,
fellowship in cardiothoracic surgery at vanderbilt .
so what went wrong ?
he had some kind of meltdown .
according to this , he falsified a document
and stole a set of lungs from the donor pool .
did some kind of experimental operation on a 10 @-@ year @-@ old child .
a few weeks later ,
the guy who was supposed to receive the transplant died .
the d.a. considered charging covington ,
but he was already off the grid .
i want to introduce you to samar navabi .
you &apos;re tall .
agent ressler . keen .
i believe you two have already met .
in warsaw . glad to see you made it out .
agent navabi is on loan to our task force indefinitely .
you &apos;re the one who found reddington .
i &apos;m sorry . are those real @-@ time nsa feeds ?
i hunted the guy for five years . how long did it take you ?
well , it was ... uh , 74 days .
we were lucky .
they would kill to see these in tehran .
how does an iranian end up working for mossad ?
how did the fbi end up working for raymond reddington ?
how did you find us in warsaw ?
who told you we were there ?
medical examiner just called . he needs to see you , stat .
how do we know we can trust her ?
we don &apos;t . but ... she did save our lives .
that buys her some good will , don &apos;t you think ?
you know reddington sent her to warsaw .
there has to be something going on there .
sounds like someone &apos;s a little jealous
uncle red &apos;s got a new crush .
dr. ryerson , what did you find ?
well ...
i , uh , just completed my autopsy on mr. wyatt here .
i was told that
that your theory was that the
the -- the heart was harvested .
it is .
yeah , well , buy a hat and hang onto it ,
because , um , that theory may have a little wrinkle .
the incision in his chest was made over
a prior midline incision .
tox screen was positive for immunosuppressive drugs ,
and , um , i am seeing scarring of the aorta .
all of which means what ?
well , t @-@ there &apos;s -- there &apos;s residual foreign tissue
left behind from when the heart was removed .
this guy had a @-@ a @-@ a previous heart transplant .
the heart that was taken from his chest
wasn &apos;t his to begin with .
look , i wish i could help ,
but my life -- it &apos;s in disarray .
we file for bankruptcy , and now this ?
mrs. wyatt , we really need you to look at the reports .
we &apos;ve been over your husband &apos;s medical files .
there &apos;s no reference to a heart transplant .
i don &apos;t know what to say .
we checked .
there &apos;s no record of your husband
ever receiving a donor organ .
they &apos;ll kill me if i talk .
unless you talk , there &apos;s nothing we can do to protect you .
dr. james covington .
your husband was one of his clients ?
paul suffered from congestive heart failure .
he needed a transplant .
h @-@ he could have waited , put his name on the donor list
like everyone else , but not paul .
we had the money ,
so he found a way to get the transplant immediately .
he bought a heart from covington .
yes and no .
the organs that dr. covington provides --
they &apos;re not available for purchase .
you rent them --
$ 500,000 for every year you use the product .
when paul &apos;s business was thriving , that wasn &apos;t a problem .
but after the s.e.c. investigation ,
we couldn &apos;t afford to pay .
and if you can &apos;t pay , you have to return the product .
excuse me ?
my husband &apos;s heart wasn &apos;t harvested .
it was repossessed .
he &apos;ll never convince them to put us in charge of the port .
i don &apos;t care what reddington says . it &apos;s reckless .
agreed . the directorate general may be an ally .
but we all know who makes the decision --
garong sundri , the deputy minister of transportation .
he &apos;s against us .
and reddington &apos;s investing a fortune in new equipment
to change his mind .
this could bankrupt us .
it &apos;s a desperate move .
gentlemen .
i &apos;m afraid you &apos;ve made a mistake , friend .
do you know where you are ?
yes , niko , i know exactly where i am .
and i know who you work with .
and unfortunately for you ,
i work with the one man in the world who doesn &apos;t care .
you work for berlin ? what do you want ?
berlin sent me with an offer .
if i were you , i would think of it
as a once @-@ in @-@ a @-@ lifetime opportunity .
repossessed for nonpayment -- like a house or a car .
exactly -- he killed paul wyatt because he didn &apos;t get
his 500 grand in the annual rental fee .
how does that work , anyway ?
once a heart &apos;s been transplanted , can it be reused ?
covington didn &apos;t kill him to reuse the heart .
he did it to send a message .
where i come from , fear is the only deterrent .
i &apos;m from delaware .
no , i @-@ i &apos;m just saying -- i &apos;m actually half @-@ jewish .
well , a quarter , really .
half @-@ muslim , too , so ... but , um ...
who &apos;s counting ?
i &apos;ve been tracking the info we got from mrs. wyatt .
according to her , they paid the annual rental fee
by making donations to a charity called the wellbright fund .
it &apos;s a registered 501 nonprofit .
did you pull a tax return , get a list of company expenses ?
yeah , and get this -- the fund paid over 200 grand
to a dr. gordon albee for consulting services .
consulting on what ?
dr. albee .
fbi .
sorry . no crime to fight .
poor norman committed suicide .
you &apos;re the medical examiner ?
the licensing board has you listed as a general surgeon .
yeah , well , i wear several hats .
one of those involve consulting
for a charity called the wellbright fund ?
what exactly do you do for the fund ?
listen , i &apos;d be happy to help ,
but , uh , i have an autopsy waiting .
you know , um , if you &apos;d call my office --
they paid you over $ 200,000 last year .
call my office .
we &apos;ve got nothing to charge him with .
and until we do ,
he &apos;s never gonna tell us what we need to know .
mr. vargas .
sounds like some shady character in a humphrey bogart film .
i like him already .
he said he worked for berlin .
and his offer ?
he said berlin &apos;s opening up a short window .
if we break with you ,
he &apos;ll let us operate under his name .
and you think some of the others were receptive .
the others are supporting you at great risk .
if the port deal goes south , it could bankrupt us .
it &apos;s a very fragile proposition .
thank you , niko .
i appreciate you coming to me with your opinion .
but i &apos;m feeling ... bullish .
keep an eye on the others .
if someone intends to defect ,
i want to be standing right in front of them .
hello ?
i need to talk to him .
i &apos;d like to borrow mr. kaplan .
oh , my god . he wouldn &apos;t stop talking .
but i was able to buy us another hour .
we need to wrap this up quickly , though .
he has bowling league at 6 : 00 .
maybe this was a mistake .
it &apos;s not .
you said yourself
it would take weeks to secure the necessary court orders ,
and how many more victims will there be by then ?
it &apos;s the same as the other three --
heart and lungs are missing .
this one still has a liver , but i see signs of cirrhosis --
probably wasn &apos;t healthy enough to be sold .
remember the time we made barley stew
with that coroner from des moines ?
it was reuben soup .
how can i forgot ? i was sleeping with his sister .
that &apos;s right .
your dr. albee &apos;s in a lot of trouble , sweetie .
this should be all you need .
four bodies , dr. albee .
you performed an autopsy on all four in the last year .
none of the four were registered organ donors ,
but all four were missing vital organs .
how do you explain that ?
fine . i &apos;ll answer for you .
you &apos;re a supplier for dr. james covington .
you provide him with vital organs for him to sell ,
and he pays you through the wellbright fund .
i don &apos;t know covington .
i was approached by an associate -- i don &apos;t know his name
about providing him with viable material .
you deal with bodies .
i thought donor organs had to be fresh .
they do .
it only works in very specific circumstances
once i get control of the body as m.e.
how much time do you have ?
depends on the organ i need .
anywhere between 30 to 90 minutes .
you transport them . how ?
i call a number . they send a courier to pick it up .
look , i &apos;ll cooperate . i &apos;ll do whatever you need .
but you have to protect me .
fine .
but first , you need to make a phone call .
what are the odds that covington &apos;s courier
will inspect the organ ?
count on it .
he &apos;s gonna have to make sure the size and weight
are a match for their patient .
you don &apos;t think that he &apos;s gonna notice
that he &apos;s staring at the heart of a 300 @-@ pound hog ?
human and porcine hearts are nearly identical .
unless he &apos;s got some expertise ,
he won &apos;t be able to tell the difference .
aram just finished the mockup
for the medical file on our fictitious donor .
old porko &apos;s got a name .
gustavo mosquera , 35,
no history of heart disease .
killed in a hit @-@ and @-@ run .
time of death -- - 30 minutes ago .
aram even generated a social and w @-@ 2
in case they run a background check .
what &apos;s our e.t.a. for delivery ?
within the hour .
my men captured this two hours ago .
titillating .
but what laskin and russo do with or to one another
in their spare time is none of my concern .
right , except a minute later ...
a threesome ? interesting .
based on his sartorial splendor , i gather this is mr. vargas .
does that even look like real hair ?
we have to assume they accepted his offer
and cut the deal with berlin .
why assume , niko ,
when i can ask them myself ?
i just sent you an image of a man
who matches our suspect &apos;s description .
got it . i am processing him through the database now .
how much time do we have ?
two hours viability max . here &apos;s his file .
ronald cassell . check fraud , theft , battery .
but he does have some medical training --
former army combat medic out of fort drum .
everything checks out here . it &apos;s a match for our client .
excellent . i &apos;ll see you in 20 minutes .
good news , mr. babbitt . we &apos;re ready to begin .
heads up , everybody . target &apos;s on the move .
ressler , he &apos;s headed towards the front door .
of course it &apos;s a motorcycle .
he made me .
i &apos;m gonna head him off . hang on .
doctor , we have a problem .
go , go , go .
go , go , go , go .
gentlemen , thank you for meeting me on such short notice .
i know you two have had a very busy day .
nothing out of the ordinary .
i hear you boys engaged in a little tryst
downtown this morning .
we had a meeting at the corgate .
this an interrogation ?
yes .
i understand an offer was made by berlin &apos;s representative .
red , look --
what i don &apos;t understand is why only one of my associates
thought to bring that to my attention .
we didn &apos;t tell because there &apos;s nothing to tell .
j.p. , i &apos;m delighted you were able to hold dear teddy &apos;s hand
and help him overcome all his anxieties
about me bankrupting our operation .
i &apos;d be lying if i told you
i wasn &apos;t concerned about this deal .
if i were you , teddy , i &apos;d be more concerned
about the plans these gentlemen have for your immediate future .
what ? what ? what are you doing ?
wait a minute .
stop ! red , red !
what &apos;s going on ?
ow ! come on !
what the hell ? don &apos;t do this . don &apos;t --
let me go !
we just lost our only lead to covington .
maybe there &apos;s another way .
i just found this on cassell .
it &apos;s a medical file of covington &apos;s next client .
the one who &apos;s getting the pig &apos;s heart ?
who is it ?
his name is bernard babbitt .
bernard babbitt , known as &quot; b.b. , &quot;
runs the desobry syndicate out of new orleans
moving drugs and weapons through the fourchon .
bureau &apos;s been trying to indict him
on racketeering and murder charges for years .
so , you know him ?
know him ? oh , my gosh .
i once shared a ride with the man
on a twin @-@ engine prop from port @-@ au @-@ prince to baracoa .
we had to counterweight the plane
with three containers of russian r.p.g.s
just to accommodate his girth .
i would have thought he &apos;d be more cautious about where he chooses to hang out .
well , b.b. &apos; s an indulgent man .
he loves to be surrounded with what he loves the most .
b.b.
just like a bear at a campsite .
you poor thing .
honestly , i don &apos;t know how you do it .
it boggles the imagination .
red .
i suppose it isn &apos;t any wonder you can justify cramming
all this grease @-@ drenched gristle into your face
given that you &apos;ve already paid
to replace that rotted nub you call a heart .
how &apos;s that going , by the way ?
i heard you had a setback --
a problem with the donor not coming through ?
give us a moment , moucher miel .
what do you want , reddington ?
the good dr. covington --
he and i need to have a conversation .
and since you happen to be in touch ,
i thought you could connect us .
b.b ...
surely you have some way to get ahold of the man .
you &apos;re in his care .
i have a number .
but strictly for emergencies .
so i sure as hell ain &apos;t giving it to you .
last thing i need to do is piss this guy off
before he cuts my chest open .
talk to me after my surgery .
b.b. , you don &apos;t look well . are you all right ?
let me guess --
irregular heartbeat , shortness of breath ,
perhaps a little tingling in your nether regions ?
what the hell are you doing ?
those drinks you &apos;ve been enjoying on the house ?
they weren &apos;t from the house . they were from me .
i hope you don &apos;t mind .
i took the liberty of adding a special surprise ingredient --
something to treat any localized dysfunction you may be suffering .
has the little man been falling down on the job ?
it &apos;s a miracle drug ,
not so much for a glutton with a bum heart , however .
but look on the bright side --
you &apos;ll die with a marvelous erection .
i can &apos;t -- i can &apos;t breathe .
well , the two gentlemen behind me happen to be paramedics .
put me in touch with covington ,
they &apos;ll be happy to assist you .
what do you think , b.b. ?
does this feel like an emergency ?
you wanted to see me ?
close the door .
i got the psych evals back from dr. friedman .
she has some concerns .
ressler . yeah .
she wanted to suspend him because he was --
she has no problem with ressler .
it &apos;s you she &apos;s concerned about .
well , that &apos;s ridiculous . i &apos;m fine .
that &apos;s what she &apos;s concerned about .
and frankly , i am , too .
you &apos;re concerned that i &apos;m fine .
that you didn &apos;t mourn
or take time off to grieve --
not for your marriage ,
but for yourself , for what keen put you through .
i will mourn when we get berlin .
dr. friedman recommended a one @-@ month paid leave .
fine . it will give me more time to hunt berlin .
i &apos;m not taking the doctor &apos;s recommendation .
but i am concerned .
the investigation &apos;s ongoing ,
and you and i both know
there &apos;s a good chance tom keen is alive .
what that &apos;s done to you , how you &apos;ve coped ,
the hotel rooms --
your paranoia is understandable ,
but i &apos;m worried it could become a problem .
well , i appreciate your concern ,
but i am doing the best i can to handle this .
elizabeth ...
i &apos;m not criticizing you .
if i were in your shoes ...
i only want you to know
that if you feel like you &apos;re under water ,
if you need to talk ,
my door is open .
thank you .
it &apos;s reddington .
hey . did you get a lead on covington ?
what are we looking at ?
we &apos;ve got a number on covington .
aram &apos;s working a trace .
it &apos;s a digital voip line .
uh , man , this thing is getting bounced all over the globe
to mask its origin .
the line just went active .
covington &apos;s making a call .
what the hell happened to cassell ?
he called in , said he ... - okay , hold on .
if he stays on the line ,
just a few more seconds , i &apos;ll have his address .
i need you here . we have a removal at 5 : 00 .
all right . i &apos;m on my way in now .
oh , no , no , no , no .
damn it .
i was only able to narrow his location down
to this five @-@ block area .
he said he had a removal .
he &apos;s gonna repossess another organ .
well , we got to move .
if we don &apos;t find covington in 43 minutes ,
we &apos;re gonna find another body .
is that the 5 @-@ 7 you &apos;ve been raving about ?
indeed . see for yourself .
polymer over steel , ambidextrous controls .
be right with you .
we &apos;ve been through this -- berlin prefers firearms
manufactured in russia or eastern europe .
just give me the same shipment as last time .
my apologies .
i expected to have that all wrapped up before you arrived .
where are we ?
it &apos;s done .
reddington bought the photo op ?
i didn &apos;t even need to present real evidence
his men had betrayed him .
he has become reckless , unstable .
it seems our arrangement is off to a promising start .
regarding that arrangement ,
i think we need to revisit the terms .
i betrayed raymond reddington .
he is not gonna just absorb that blow and move on .
i need him taken care of .
if berlin wanted reddington dead ,
he would have done that already .
yeah , well , things have changed .
you &apos;re doing business with me now .
i know everything about reddington &apos;s operation ,
and i &apos;m willing to hand over all of that to your employer ,
but i need reddington gone .
i can &apos;t be an effective partner to berlin
if i &apos;m always looking over my shoulder .
set a meeting with reddington .
my people will take care of the rest .
landlord &apos;s still not answering .
this has to be the place .
we &apos;ve been to every retail store ,
office park , and restaurant in the area .
we got 20 minutes till covington kills his next victim .
what are you doing ?
i like to keep a spare key in the trunk .
hey . anything ?
a whole lot of nothing .
hey , keen . look at this .
we got a stairway to the lower level .
lower level ?
yeah . there &apos;s some kind of access stairway .
the building plans filed with the city
don &apos;t say anything about a lower level .
hands . hands . let me see your hands .
you can &apos;t be in here .
i got this .
wait , sir . look , don &apos;t go in there .
sit down .
please . i &apos;m begging you .
i said , &quot; sit . &quot;
back away from the table .
i don &apos;t know who the hell you are --
hands in the air ! step away from the table now !
you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re doing .
it &apos;s over , dr. covington .
we know about your business .
you lost your license
for performing an experimental operation on a child .
well , not this one . not today .
i &apos;m not trying to hurt the boy .
i &apos;m trying to save him .
his name is daniel .
if he doesn &apos;t get these lungs in the next 24 hours ,
he won &apos;t survive .
he needs to be in a hospital .
it &apos;s too late for that .
i &apos;m performing this operation .
if you want to stop me , you &apos;ll have to shoot me .
won &apos;t be a problem .
there are strict rules
controlling who gets access to donor organs and when .
in the present system ,
they offer adult donor lungs to adults ,
even if there are children with a more urgent need .
i &apos;m not discussing this with you .
i took adult lungs
and transplanted them into a little girl .
that &apos;s why i lost my license -- for saving her life .
so you know better ?
okay , putting adult lungs into children is a risk .
but i believe , in many cases , we have an obligation to try .
and i &apos;m not the only one .
times are changing .
there &apos;s even an official appeals process for these cases now .
then his parents can request an exception to the rule .
and risk being turned down .
at least here , i guarantee him a chance .
you killed paul wyatt .
you ripped the heart out of his chest .
look , you can think whatever you want about me ,
but every dime i &apos;ve made on criminals like paul wyatt
has been spent to build and operate this place .
all that matters today
is that there will be no tomorrow
for this boy if i don &apos;t do this transplant .
the donor material is already here .
if we don &apos;t use it , it will die ,
just like he will .
if we take him in now , that kid won &apos;t make it .
can you live with that ?
covington &apos;s not just a surgeon , keen .
he &apos;s a killer .
yeah , and right now , he &apos;s that boy &apos;s only chance .
look at his parents .
what if that were your kid ?
and what if something goes wrong ?
what if he dies on the table ? how do we explain that ?
can you cover with cooper and aram ?
just buy us some time .
liz , this is way over the line .
we have to let him do this .
niko , you &apos;re all in a sweat .
what &apos;s so important that it couldn &apos;t wait ?
we &apos;ve been partners a long time ,
and we &apos;ve had more than our share of success ,
so i wanted to pay you the courtesy
of looking you in the eye when i tell you you &apos;re out .
i see .
and you &apos;re speaking for ... ?
everybody .
we &apos;re united .
you &apos;ve become a liability .
don &apos;t forget who you &apos;re talking to .
how could i ?
especially since it &apos;s our last conversation .
raymond reddington , mr. vargas .
i may have misled you .
someone did take berlin up on his offer ,
but it wasn &apos;t laskin and russo .
it was me .
well played , niko .
i didn &apos;t think you had it in you .
kill him .
i find chrome to be a bit ostentatious .
i &apos;m sorry , mr. demakis .
the truth is i &apos;m the one who misled you .
you know , when i was 15,
i had a summer job
installing carpets for albert kodagolian
on lake charlevoix .
horrible job -- hot , indoors ,
forced to listen to &quot; the gambler &quot; on 8 @-@ track
while the rest of the world was at the beach .
three days into the job , i knew i had to quit .
i asked my father for advice .
all he wanted to know was whether i &apos;d given my word
to mr. kodagolian that i &apos;d work the summer .
i told him i had .
my father suggested i stick it out .
i &apos;d given my word .
worst eight weeks of my life .
until the last day .
mr. kodagolian shows up at the jobsite ,
pulls me aside , and tells me that in 27 years ,
no kid has ever made it through the summer ,
gives me a bonus -- $ 40 .
the most valuable money i &apos;ve ever made .
a priceless lesson about life .
value loyalty above all else .
oh ! i buried the lede .
turns out the indonesian government has chosen
to contract our company to run the port of tankulu .
the deputy minister of transportation was not a fan .
fortunately , he was also gravely ill
and in desperate need of a heart transplant .
he died this morning .
apparently , the arrangements he &apos;d made
to secure a donor heart didn &apos;t pan out .
the new deputy minister sees things our way .
lucky , i guess .
i don &apos;t believe luck had anything to do with it .
you &apos;re right . luck rarely has anything to do with it .
honestly , how many times have we
discussed this ?
what ?
you -- you know i don &apos;t like being around the bloody st --
i need to be allowed to leave the room before the blood .
you know i don &apos;t have a strong constitution .
give him his seat . he &apos;s gonna faint .
oh , my .
thank you .
hey , you think reddington knew that covington was trying to save kids ?
for every child covington saved , there were three killers
like b.b. he kept alive to victimize innocent people .
it &apos;s a trade @-@ off i &apos;d make .
the fact that you &apos;re even thinking about
what trade @-@ offs you &apos;d make , what rules you &apos;d ignore --
the agent keen i met a year ago would have never done that .
you caught covington , and the child is in recovery .
it sounds like a victory .
yeah .
you guys don &apos;t celebrate when you close a big case ?
come on . let me buy you a drink .
thanks , but i think i &apos;m just gonna head out .
♬ come a long way ♬
all you know about me is that i found reddington
and whatever you might have read in a slim dossier .
♬ come a long way ♬
and now we &apos;re working together with all that that implies .
♬ come a long way ♬
i &apos;m sure you don &apos;t know what to think .
♬ not to work it out ♬
you &apos;re wrong .
i &apos;m not wrong . you &apos;re right not to trust me .
♬ as cold comfort ♬
oh , you &apos;re right about that .
♬ wraps around you in the dark ♬
you &apos;re wrong if you think you found reddington .
if he was found , it &apos;s because he wanted to be
♬ come a long way ♬
and he wanted you to find him .
or maybe i &apos;m just good at what i do .
is that so difficult to believe ?
if he wanted you here , he has a reason .
♬ come a long way ♬
that &apos;s why i don &apos;t trust you --
because i don &apos;t know what the reason is
♬ come a long way ♬
and i &apos;m guessing neither do you .
♬ not to ask the question ♬
♬ that &apos;s been on your lips all the way ♬
♬ spit it out ♬
♬ the words come out ♬
♬ yeah ♬
hey , sir ?
look , i &apos;m sorry about that incident with the , um , frisking .
♬ from small beginnings ♬
don &apos;t worry about it .
so , is that your thing -- unprovoked frisking ?
♬ come a long way ♬
that &apos;s my thing .
i &apos;m a federal agent .
figured it would be something like that .
better safe than sorry , right ?
have a good night .
you , too .
♬ from small beginnings ♬
♬ come big endings ♬
♬ from small beginnings ♬
♬ come big endings ♬
♬ from small beginnings ♬
♬ come big endings ♬
♬ from small beginnings ♬
♬ come big endings ♬
you look so different .
not as different as you .
