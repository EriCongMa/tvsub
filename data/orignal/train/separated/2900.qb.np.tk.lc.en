yeah , i guess we don &apos;t have a choice .
help us ! please help us !
we &apos;re stuck up on the roof , and we can &apos;t get down !
ross .
i was thinking we &apos;d just go down the fire escape .
i know . i wasn &apos;t finished .
but don &apos;t worry !
we &apos;re gonna go down the fire escape !
i &apos;m sorry , i thought i &apos;d make some warm milk and it would help me sleep .
with a wok ?
thought you were gonna read my book to put you to sleep ?
it got interesting .
damn you , oprah !
here , let me make the milk . i &apos;m up anyway .
you know what we could do now that we &apos;re up ?
we could just talk to each other all night long .
like we did when we were first going out . it &apos;d be fun .
okay , that does sound fun .
yeah .
so how bummed were you when the second sister died , huh ?
the second sister dies ? !
no .
no , i was talking about the book i was reading .
the second sister dies in archie and jughead double digest ?
that &apos;s correct .
want to go in the bedroom ? it &apos;s a little more comfortable .
sure .
okay .
oh , wait , did you send those contracts to milan ?
if this is your idea of sexy talk ...
did you overnight the contracts i gave you ?
what contracts ?
please tell me this is just one of your jokes that i don &apos;t get .
like what ?
like the thing when you put the phone in your pants ?
tag , i &apos;m serious . this isn &apos;t funny .
those contracts had to go out today .
you didn &apos;t give me any contracts .
yes , i did . i put a little post @-@ it on it that said :
&quot; must go out today , &quot; and i underlined &quot; today &quot; three times .
then i put a little heart in the corner because i didn &apos;t wanna seem too bossy .
you never gave them to me .
if we went to the office , you would see those contracts sitting on your desk .
no , i &apos;d see you looking embarrassed because they are not on my desk .
maybe i &apos;d look embarrassed because you &apos;re talking on the phone with your crotch .
you want to go to the office now ?
come on , it &apos;s late . we &apos;re not going down to the office .
yeah , i understand . i wouldn &apos;t want to be proved wrong either .
all right , get your coat !
oh ! when did you unook this ? nice work !
it won &apos;t go down any further . it &apos;s stuck .
we &apos;re just gonna have to jump .
now , we &apos;re gonna have to make sure to land ...
... to the right of that patch of ice , okay ?
not hit the dumpster on the other side .
and try to avoid that weird brownish @-@ red stuff in the middle .
so when you get down there ...
... you go up to the roof and you let me in .
wait a minute . i have to do it ?
you &apos;ll be fine .
it &apos;ll be just like bungee jumping , you know ?
but instead of bouncing back up , you won &apos;t .
well , what if i smack my head on the concrete ?
well , i &apos;m not gonna lie to you , joey . it &apos;s a possibility .
i don &apos;t know . tell you what , let &apos;s flip to see who does it .
you call it in the air , all right ?
oh , all right .
can you see what it is ?
no .
okay . well , you be careful .
no , ross , stop it .
i &apos;m not jumping .
look , i have an audition tomorrow , and i can &apos;t go if i break my leg .
well , i &apos;m not jumping . i have a son . he won &apos;t have a father if i die .
so it looks like we &apos;re even .
okay , so this wire ...
... is connected to this wire , which plugs into here .
okay , so to get the beeping to stop , all i have to do ...
well done , pheebs .
what do you want from me ? !
here &apos;s your milk . what do you wanna talk about ?
what ? what ? what ?
oh , were you sleeping , sweetie ? i &apos;m sorry . here .
oh , that &apos;s so much better . okay .
at least i can hear myself think .
god , stop singing .
stop singing !
okay . feel free to look ...
... but i &apos;m telling you , those contracts are not on this desk .
how could you possibly know ? look at this mess , tag .
this is what i &apos;m talking about . you have to be more organized .
you &apos;ve got newspapers , you &apos;ve got magazines , you ... oh !
and who &apos;s this chippy ?
a little young for you , but whatever .
that &apos;s my sister .
really ? very cute braces .
anyway , you know what ? the point is , tag , start looking ...
... because you &apos;re gonna find those contracts on your desk .
so when do you imagine you gave them to me ? morning or afternoon ?
in the afternoon . mr. zelner came into my office after lunch ...
... he put them on my desk , and then i put a post @-@ it on it ...
... that said :
&quot; must go out today . &quot;
so you just keep looking in there , all right ?
they &apos;re not here .
puzzler .
bit of a puzzle .
why don &apos;t you check the copy room . maybe you left the contracts in there .
how could i have left them there ?
i don &apos;t know .
how can your genitals make phone calls ?
okay ? it &apos;s not a perfect world . just go , please ?
fine .
thank you .
hello ?
i still don &apos;t get it .
you still awake ?
yeah . you ?
you do know that was me that just said that , right ?
hey .

yeah ?
i hope you &apos;re not thinking about cleaning the living room .
man , i &apos;m starving . what the hell was i thinking at dinner ?
&quot; do you want soup or salad ? &quot; both , always order both .
you know , i &apos;m looking , and i don &apos;t think anyone &apos;s home here .
i say we just break the window ...
... crawl through ...
... and you know , explain later .
no one &apos;s home ?
i don &apos;t think so .
hello ?
so when you get in there ...
okay . this is where you and i part ways .
noisy bitch !
oh , what ? what are you doing ?
do you know what just happened ?
yeah . we had sex , and then we fell asleep .
no . we were in the middle of sex ...
... and you fell asleep .
no . no , that &apos;s not true .
no , best time ever .
yeah . you rock my world .
monica ?

okay , i &apos;m up . i &apos;m up .
hi . i got you some coffee to ...
so you got anything for me ?
still no luck .
oh , my god .

i wish you would .
well , no , it &apos;s not in there .

i don &apos;t know .
i mean , let me check .

i &apos;m not even gonna gloat .
i &apos;m just really relieved that this whole ...

i did not .
oh , really ?
they slid out of your bottom drawer ...
... crawled across the floor , then jumped onto my desk ?
how did you know they were in my bottom drawer ?
i am so hot for you right now .
oh , my god ! how did you get back here ?
phoebe buffay ?
fire alarm ?
oh , hi , officer fireman . can i help you ?
we found your fire alarm in the trash .
that &apos;s not mine .
yes , it is .
how do you know ?
next time you dump a fire alarm ...
... don &apos;t use a blanket that says , &quot; property of phoebe buffay , not monica . &quot;
do you have a search warrant ?
because the last time i checked , this was still america .
please reattach it . it &apos;s illegal to disconnect them .
fine . but please , god , tell me how to stop it from going off ?
press the reset button .
there &apos;s a reset button ? oh , thank you . thank you .
oh . there &apos;s a reset button ?

... or should i climb down your back so we &apos;re ...
... butt to face ?
face to face .
i like face to face .
okay , here i come .
all right .
oh , my ... how much do you weigh , ross ?
i prefer not to answer . i &apos;m still carrying a little holiday weight .
when we talked about face to face ...
... i don &apos;t think we thought it all the way through .
what do you want me to do ?
just shimmy down me and drop .
hi .
hi .
you know , maybe i should hang , and you should climb down me .
yeah ? maybe we should talk about that for a little while !
it still looks pretty far .
it &apos;s not that far . just drop .
do not rush me !
my pants are starting to come down , and i &apos;m not wearing any underwear .
my ankle ! i really hurt my ankle !
i think i twisted it when ... a quarter !
that really was some of your best work .
i told you .
i can &apos;t believe it .
i &apos;ve only got two hours until i call in sick for work .
i have to be up in seven minutes .
well , you &apos;re not gonna believe this , but if you have seven minutes ...
