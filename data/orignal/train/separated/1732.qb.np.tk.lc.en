第七季 第十集
sheldon , did you just figure out a method
for synthesizing a new stable super @-@ heavy element ?
did i ?
well , that can &apos;t be right .
no one &apos;s ever done that before .
except me , because i just did it !
sheldon and his brain-- yeah !
sheldon and his brain-- yeah !
i &apos;ve made a horrible mistake .
what are you talking about ?
this table-- it &apos;s in square centimeters .
i read it as square meters .
you know what that means ?
that americans can &apos;t handle the metric system ?
amy , i was off by a factor of 10,000 .
but the chinese team found the element .
yeah , well , they shouldn &apos;t have .
my calculations were wrong .
the greatest scientific achievement of my life
is based on a blunder .
i &apos;m not a genius ,
i &apos;m a fraud .
you know , sheldon , in neuroscience ,
we &apos;re forever finding something in one part of the brain
that we thought was someplace else .
oh , great , now i &apos;m worse than a fraud .
i &apos;m practically a biologist .
this is science friday . i &apos;m ira flatow .
my guest today is responsible for the discovery
of the first stable super @-@ heavy element .
welcome , dr. sheldon cooper .
thank you .
uh , the university made me come here .
i didn &apos;t want to .
uh , big fan of the show .
so , i understand that you actually discovered
this element by mistake .
yes .
and some people in the science community are calling it
&quot; the wonder blunder . &quot;
who ?
give me their names .
i bet it &apos;s wolowitz .
it &apos;s just such a fascinating story .
your calculations are way off ,
but they find the element anyway .
it &apos;s like misreading a treasure map
and still finding the treasure .
can we talk about something else ?
do you know that i yodel ?
that &apos;s interesting , but this could be taking you
down the path toward a nobel prize .
and in chemistry , no less .
and wouldn &apos;t that be unusual ?
because you &apos;re a physicist .
yes , yes , i &apos;d be a physicist with a nobel in chemistry .
everyone laugh at the circus freak .
you know , i don &apos;t need to sit here and take this , flatow .
it is because of bullies like you ,
every day more and more americans
are making the switch to television .
president seibert , i don &apos;t know why you &apos;re yelling .
you &apos;re the one who made me go on the radio .
i was expecting a professional science interview ,
not an attack by some morning zoo shock jock .
well , if the university needs money so badly ,
perhaps you should start a swear jar .
that one &apos;s worth a dollar .
i know you don &apos;t like it ,
but every time you do an interview ,
it raises the profile of the university .
that translates to funding .
yeah , well , i &apos;m not just some trained monkey
dancing for coins .
of course you &apos;re not .
people love trained monkeys .
how can you not be happy ?
you &apos;re tall , thin and famous .
oh , my god , i &apos;m jealous of sheldon .
look , you &apos;re gonna be doing this stuff for a while .
you &apos;re just gonna have to find a way to get used to it .
but none of you know what this is like .
being celebrated for something you wish you never did .
mmm ... you clearly haven &apos;t been with me at mardi gras .
want to pause the video game and help me clean up ?
i am cleaning up .
look at the mess the joker made of gotham city .
come on , it &apos;s your friend who &apos;s coming to stay here .
raj grew up in india .
trust me , he &apos;s seen worse .
howie .
i promise i &apos;ll help out the rest of the week .
the rest of the week ?
you said it was just gonna be a night or two .
yeah , but if i told you a week ,
would you have said yes ?
no !
then you left me no choice .
i love raj , but that &apos;s a long time for a house guest .
i know , but they &apos;re tenting his building .
he can &apos;t find a hotel he likes that allows dogs .
he &apos;s bringing cinnamon ?
for a whole week !
the nerve of some people .
here comes the embarrassment express .
with stops at fraudville ...
wonderblunderberg ...
and kansas city .
because it &apos;s a hub .
sheldon , can i come in ?
do you have cookies ?
no .
good . i don &apos;t deserve cookies . come in .
wil ... ?
hey , sheldon .
it &apos;s been a while .
why are you here ?
amy said you were having a rough time ,
and i thought maybe we could talk .
is that okay ?
certainly .
although ...
right now , i &apos;m having a rough time
because there &apos;s three people in my room ,
and it &apos;s starting to feel like a discotheque .
sheldon , you said you were unhappy getting attention
for something you wished you never did .
yeah , i know a little something about that .
oh , nonsense , wil .
your endless tweets are not that bad .
i remember why it &apos;s been a while .
sheldon , i was actually talking
about when i was a kid on star trek .
how could you not like getting attention
for playing wesley crusher ?
you were wonderful .
a know @-@ it @-@ all boy genius with an eidetic memory .
who couldn &apos;t relate to that ?
well , not everybody felt that way .
a lot of people really hated the character ,
and some of them hated me because of it .
i would do interviews ,
and people would be mean to me .
that just happened to me .
next time you &apos;re stuck for a tweet ,
feel free to say what a jerk ira flatow is .
sheldon , the point is wil learned to embrace that part of his life
and moved on to bigger and better things .
yeah , i &apos;m an author now ,
i do public speaking ,
and i have my own web series about board games .
we &apos;re trying to cheer him up , so ...
i &apos;m just saying that there was a time when i thought
i would never get out of wesley crusher &apos;s shadow .
but now ,
it &apos;s just one small part of a pretty great life ,
and it &apos;s a part that i &apos;m happy is there .
i do see what you &apos;re saying .
that helps .
good .
would you two like to stay and play trains with me ?
sure .
okay .
oh , great !
now ...
i work the controls .
i say &quot; all aboard , &quot;
you sit quietly and watch .
can i blow the whistle ?
you should probably go .
you &apos;re gonna brush your teeth on my couch ?
no , i &apos;m gonna brush cinnamon &apos;s teeth .
why bother ?
she spends half the time licking her butt .
and the other half licking my face .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m brushing her teeth .
hey , guys . sorry i &apos;m so late .
did you already have dinner ?
no , we were waiting for you .
aw , that &apos;s so sweet .
yeah . so what do you feel like making ?
howard , the poor thing just got home from work .
let me get you a glass of wine .
i &apos;ll cook dinner .
oh , raj , you &apos;re our guest .
don &apos;t be silly .
sit . you look like you &apos;ve had a long day .
no , she always looks like that .
because she married an idiot .
thank you , raj .
please , this is my way of thanking you
for letting me stay here .
now , tell us all about your day .
okay , um , well , first , i was late to a meeting
&apos;cause i was stuck in traffic .
well , i keep telling you to put that traffic app on your phone .
hey , when you got home today complaining that you felt sick
from eating too many jelly beans ,
did i tell you how to fix it ?
no .
i said , &quot; aw , that must hurt , &quot;
and i rubbed your belly .
i thought of you the whole time .
all i &apos;m saying is there &apos;s a time to just listen .
thank you .
there &apos;s also a time to stop eating too many jelly beans .
and it &apos;s when you &apos;re ten .
hello , president siebert .
thank you for taking my call .
i just wanted you to know that you can now expect
enthusiastic participation from me regarding my discovery .
oh , no , no , no , no .
no need to thank me .
thank my friend , wil wheaton .
for your information , i have nine friends , hmm ?
ten if we include you .
nine it is .
ah , it &apos;s ten . i &apos;ll count wolowitz .
hello , friend leonard .
hey , you &apos;re in a good mood .
i &apos;m in a great mood .
well , you &apos;re about to be in an even better one .
i didn &apos;t want to say anything until i knew for sure ,
but ...
i &apos;ve been re @-@ running the tests on your element in my lab
and i disproved it .
your element does not exist !
yeah , but what about the chinese research team ?
they found it .
yeah , it turns out someone added
simulated signals to the data files .
they faked the results .
really ?
yes !
do you know what that means ?
that means all of this attention that you hate goes away .
so no more interviews ?
no , it &apos;s all over .
i can &apos;t believe it .
well , you &apos;re welcome .
you robbed me of my greatest achievement !
what ? !
i &apos;m back down to nine friends !
make it eight-- i &apos;m sick of wolowitz , too !
i @-@ i don &apos;t understand .
all you &apos;ve done since you discovered
this stupid element was complain .
i was trying to make you happy !
by taking away my only claim to fame ?
well , if you wanted to make me happy ,
you could have told me a joke .
or shown me a cute video
of a koala and an otter
becoming unlikely friends .
oh , there is no winning with you .
and koalas and otters don &apos;t even live near each other !
that &apos;s what makes their friendship unlikely !
what &apos;s with all the yelling ?
leonard disproved my element .
now all the attention is going to go away .
oh , that &apos;s great . you must be thrilled !
that &apos;s it ! i &apos;m down to seven friends .
he &apos;s counting hobbits and superheroes , right ?
when i thought the element was real , i didn &apos;t want it .
but now that leonard made it not exist ,
i want it more than anything in the world .
the @-@ the element never existed .
i didn &apos;t take it away , science took it away .
be mad at science .
don &apos;t you dare use science against me .
science is my best friend !
oh , good , i &apos;m back up to eight .
will you tell him he &apos;s out of his mind .
actually , i get what he &apos;s saying .
oh , yes ! nine !
welcome back , buddy .
it &apos;s like if you &apos;re dating someone you &apos;re not that into ,
and then they break up with you
and then you want them more than ever .
i have no idea what she &apos;s talking about .
but we &apos;re ganged up on you so i agree .
okay , sheldon , what do you want me to do ,
hide the information ?
if i don &apos;t publish it ,
it &apos;s just a matter of time before someone else does .
no , no , of course you have to publish .
that &apos;s your responsibility as a scientist .
doing otherwise would be unethical .
you have no choice .
fine , i &apos;ll publish .
can you believe this guy ?
aw ! raj did the dishes .
how do you know i didn &apos;t do them ?
because once , when all the knives were dirty ,
you cut a bagel with your keys .
good morning , everybody .
i picked up coffee while i was out .
bernadette , here &apos;s your soy peppermint mocha .
aw , you didn &apos;t have to do that .
oh , my pleasure ,
and don &apos;t worry about your presentation today .
you &apos;re gonna be great .
yeah , you &apos;re gonna knock it out of the park .
what presentation do i have today ?
just go .
he loves you .
what are you doing ?
are you trying to make me look bad ?
i &apos;m just being a good house guest .
no , you &apos;re being a better husband than i am .
doing the dishes , getting coffee ,
knowing about her life--
who does that ?
oh , come on , i brought you one , too .
i don &apos;t want coffee .
that &apos;s why i got you hot chocolate .
give me that .
just stop showing me up .
howard , listen to me .
you &apos;re a great husband .
yes , your listening skills could use some work .
but it &apos;s amazing how far you &apos;ve come
given that you &apos;re an only child
raised by an over @-@ protective mom .
um , is this getting weird ?
hang on .
so , yes .
i just wanted to let you know that i @-@ i posted my findings .
i saw .
and i just posted a retraction of my paper .
now the whole scientific community knows i was wrong .
these things happen all the time , sheldon .
not to me .
the only other retraction i ever had to issue
was when i was seven and i conceded that my brother
was the greatest ninja in east texas .
but that was just a ploy
to get my face out of his armpit .
there he is !
it &apos;s my favorite superhero--
the retractor !
come on , don &apos;t give him a hard time .
i &apos;m sorry , cooper .
i retract it .
by the way , hofstadter ,
nice job disproving the chinese team .
it &apos;s not a big deal .
it &apos;s a huge deal .
cooper , maybe physics just isn &apos;t your thing .
have you ever considered a career in retail ?
that way you could take things back for a living .
okay , barry , that &apos;s enough .
oh , no , that &apos;s okay .
i can fight my own battles .
isn &apos;t that right , &quot; bawwy . &quot;
is ... ?
is that a reference to my speech impediment ?
that &apos;s pretty hurtful .
i ...
i can &apos;t control it .
you &apos;re right ,
that was uncalled for .
i take it back .
of course you do .
because you &apos;re the retractor !
raj , this dinner was amazing .
if you &apos;re here much longer ,
i &apos;m gonna have to buy bigger clothes .
nonsense .
you need a little fattening up .
you &apos;ve been looking too skinny lately .
howie , how come you never say anything sweet like that ?
what are you talking about ?
remember last week , when i asked you
if you were wearing spanx and you weren &apos;t ?
how &apos;s that different ?
maybe you could try being more thoughtful ,
like your friend raj .
yeah , well , maybe you could try being more like raj .
oh , really ?
yeah , yeah .
he packed me a lunch this morning .
and there was a note inside that said , &quot; go get &apos; em &quot;
like i don &apos;t do enough around here .
now i need to pack your lunch ?
and by the way , why do you need a note telling you
to &quot; go get &apos; em &quot; ? you &apos;re a grown man !
you should know to &quot; go get &apos; em &quot; !
i do know to &quot; go get &apos; em &quot;
but sometimes it &apos;s nice to have emotional support
when i &apos;m going and getting them !
hey , hey , do you hear yourselves ?
let &apos;s just , you know , all calm down and take a step back .
this is stupid . why are we fighting ?
i don &apos;t know .
i guess i was just feeling like i &apos;m a lousy husband .
you &apos;re not a lousy husband .
you &apos;re a great husband .
i was the one feeling like a lousy wife .
are you kidding ? you &apos;re the best .
i know what the problem is .
it &apos;s him !
oh , what did i do ?
you made us feel like we &apos;re not trying hard enough .
yeah , we were totally fine half @-@ assing our marriage
till you showed up .
look , i &apos;m sorry you &apos;re upset with me ,
but i just have to say it &apos;s nice to see
the two of you on the same page .
oh , it does feel good to have you
backing me up for once .
i back you up all the time !
that is not ...
he &apos;s doing it again !
what is wrong with you ? !
i can &apos;t believe they kicked you out .
i can &apos;t believe they &apos;re still married .
oh , no , i forgot cinnamon &apos;s toothbrush at howard &apos;s .
i guess you &apos;re sharing with daddy again .
bark once if you need me to call peta .
what &apos;s that animal doing in our apartment ?
oh , relax , she &apos;s in her crate . she can &apos;t get out .
i have two words for you :
jurassic park .
this day just keeps getting worse and worse .
you know , if it makes you feel any better ...
it probably won &apos;t .
you &apos;re probably right .
sheldon , it &apos;s a beautiful night .
why don &apos;t you and i go for a nice walk together ?
oh , everything is just sex with you isn &apos;t it ?
sheldon , i think you might find the support
you &apos;re looking for , if you realize that
relationships are a give and take .
she can only be there for you
as much as you are for her .
thank you , rajesh .
and , amy , you need to be patient with sheldon ,
instead of pressuring him
to accept intimacy on your terms .
you should probably go .
i &apos;m ira flatow , and this is science friday .
i &apos;d like to welcome back dr. sheldon cooper ,
who thought he had discovered a new super @-@ heavy element
only to have it disproved by my next guest ,
dr. leonard hofstadter .
welcome to science friday , gentlemen .
thanks .
thank you .
ira , if i may , i &apos;d like to apologize
for my behavior last week .
it &apos;s all right .
now , isn &apos;t there something you &apos;d like to say to me ?
no .
now , dr. hofstadter .
can you walk us through the process
you used to disprove his theory ?
well ...
i believe i can answer that .
he asked me .
fine .
as i was saying ...
you &apos;re telling it wrong . ira ...
to really understand the story here ,
you have to start at the very beginning :
a small town in east texas , where a young genius named ...
sheldon ...
that &apos;s right , sheldon cooper .
he was bitten by his neighbor &apos;s dog ,
leading to his first scientific breakthrough--
the doggie death @-@ ray .
which , sadly , he couldn &apos;t build
because santa wouldn &apos;t bring him enriched uranium .
i mean , i &apos;d really like to hear it from dr. hofstadter ,
if it &apos;s okay with you .
what a surprise .
did @-@ did you invite me back just so you could ignore me ?
actually , i didn &apos;t invite you .
you came in , you took a seat ,
and i &apos;m not comfortable with confrontation .
sheldon , this interview is supposed to be about me .
well , that seems like a snooze .
even for public radio .
you know , if we did a shot every time
they said something embarrassing ,
this would be one hell of a drinking game .
a little early for alcohol , isn &apos;t it ?
you know , i don &apos;t just say smart things about science .
i also yodel .
i &apos;ll get the vodka .
