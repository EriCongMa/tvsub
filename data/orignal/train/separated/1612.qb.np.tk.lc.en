we found our romeo .
all we need to do is find our juliet .
i don &apos;t want you in my musical ,
but you were hands down the best .
privatization is incredibly effective .
we can get so much more done .
this is callie , my sister .
she &apos;s the girl you loved and couldn &apos;t be with .
she &apos;s trying to help gabe get off the sex offender registry .
he &apos;s on that list because of me .
talked to a lawyer and she said it was almost impossible .
i had cancer and i had to have both of my breasts removed .
since i met daphne ,
all she &apos;s talked about is getting her daughter back .
she was a role model at girls united
and she really worked the program
and got her high school diploma .
she &apos;s a good friend and a good person .
she &apos;s made some mistakes ,
but she &apos;s taken responsibility for them
and she &apos;s worked really hard to turn her life around
for her daughter .
i &apos;m ... i &apos;m sure
both of you have done a great job taking care of tasha ,
and ... and i think it &apos;s wonderful that you want to adopt her .
i was a foster kid and i got adopted ,
and i have an amazing family now .
but if my mother were alive and ...
she wanted to raise me ...
i &apos;d want to be with her .
i think if a foster kid has a biological parent
who loves them and can take care of them ,
they deserve a chance .
and at what cost to the child ?
if she can &apos;t take care of her .
i understand that this is very emotional
for both parties , but let &apos;s ...
not speak out of turn .
thank you , callie .
daphne obviously has a good friend in you as well .
your honor , can i ask callie a few questions ?
go ahead .
callie , didn &apos;t your good friend daphne
beat you up in juvenile detention ?
well , that was before we really knew each other .
so , you were a total stranger when she assaulted you ?
she &apos;s not that person anymore .
did you do anything to provoke her ?
no .
so , daphne &apos;s capable of striking out randomly for no reason ?
no , i wouldn &apos;t say that , and daphne has changed .
yes , yes , she &apos;s graduated from assault to kidnapping .
so i &apos;ll meet you at the doctor &apos;s office ?
you don &apos;t have to come .
they &apos;re just gonna pump me up full of saline .
well , i know , but it &apos;s not nothing .
it &apos;s emotional .
i &apos;m just not looking forward
to being filled up like a balloon every week .
should &apos;ve done the implants when they did the mastectomy .
well , it seemed like a lot to go through all at once .
definitely not looking forward to going under again .
well , you know , you don &apos;t have to .
i don &apos;t want to be awake for it .
no , i mean have the surgery period .
well , then what would i do ?
you would just take the expanders out and be done with it .
oh , yeah , that would be ... that &apos;d be great for our sex life .
why do you say that ?
i &apos;m self @-@ conscious enough as it is , lena .
you know , about the way i ... i look
and not being touched , and ...
i certainly don &apos;t feel sexy .
well , you haven &apos;t fully recovered yet either .
it &apos;s ...
it would just take time
to get used to seeing yourself differently .
yeah ? what about you ?
you think you &apos;d get used to it ?
still be attracted to me without breasts ?
i &apos;d have sex with you right now if you wanted .
why ? you wanna buy me dinner first ?
i &apos;m just saying ,
it &apos;s not an issue for me .
so then what would i do ?
go get a prosthetic bra or something ?
if you wanted .
but you wouldn &apos;t even have to do that .
yeah , right .
a cop with a flat chest . i can hear the comments now .
people already think i &apos;m butch .
who cares what they think ?
yeah , well ...
yeah ?
hey ...
certainly hope you don &apos;t think
you &apos;re going anywhere in those shorts .
what &apos;s wrong with them ?
well , the only cheeks i want the world to see are on your face .
oh , but it &apos;s okay for jesus &apos; pants to be around his thighs ?
uh , no . you need to put a belt on or change those pants .
what &apos;s that ?
letters of support for gabe to get off
the sex offenders list from victor , elena , and ana .
victor and elena ?
they wrote a letter ...
even after ana showed up to your party like she did ?
it wasn &apos;t gabe &apos;s fault .
besides , ana &apos;s going to , like , two meetings a day .
she wants to make it right and so do we , so ...
we wrote letters too .
you wrote a letter too ?
even if he doesn &apos;t want anything to do with us ,
it &apos;s unfair he &apos;s gotta live like this .
but since we can &apos;t give them to gabe ourselves ,
we were wondering if you could .
clearly , both parties love this little girl
and want to be a parent to her .
the court is inclined to reunify children
with their birth parents when appropriate .
but in this case , i &apos;m not certain that it is .
i would like to stay my custody ruling
for another 30 days , in which time ms. keene
must prove she can find gainful employment
and provide financially for tasha
without any government aid .
hey , this is good .
she &apos;s giving you a chance .
she ain &apos;t giving me no chance .
she knows i can &apos;t get a job that &apos;s gonna pay me enough
to take care of me and tasha without food stamps .
she &apos;s just covering her ass .
i &apos;m never gonna get my baby back .
get a room .
um , brother right here .
so , how &apos;s it going with the sets ?
well . good . fine .
you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re doing , do you ?
mariana .
we need to rehearse . come on .
no , what we need is someone
who actually knows how to build a set .
look , it &apos;s fine , and i got it under control .
see ? he has it under control . let &apos;s go .
ah , okay .
uh , it &apos;s cool . we &apos;re all good .
see ? that &apos;s going to be me falling to my death opening night .
are you not worried ?
no , what i &apos;m worried about is the rest of the cast
is off @-@ book and killing it except for my leads .
i &apos;m off @-@ book .
well , you &apos;re not killing it .
well , if mat detached himself from zoey &apos;s face ,
maybe we could actually get something done .
seriously , it &apos;s not too late to make a no cast and crew dating rule .
sure , and you can &apos;t date james dean over there .
whatever .
at least i &apos;m not macking on amy winehouse .
okay , guys , you &apos;re supposed to be in love .
it &apos;s called acting .
i don &apos;t know if the song &apos;s working .
maybe we might have to tweak the lyrics of something .
is it my words or shakespeare &apos;s that you &apos;re not feeling ?
well , it could be the fact that juliet is supposed to be a virgin ,
and our actress is singing like she &apos;s ariana grande .
i need a bathroom break .
are you okay ?
i &apos;m fine .
what ? i was just giving her some constructive criticism .
look , i know that you and mariana have a history ,
but you broke up with her .
how is this your business ?
well , she &apos;s my girlfriend and this is my warehouse .
your daddy &apos;s warehouse .
which nick is letting us use ,
so mat , walk away .
mat , walk away .
fyi , mat had a good reason to break up with mariana .
she cheated on him .
come in .
thanks .
so is everything okay ?
yeah , fine . i just ...
your address was all i had , so ...
what &apos;s this ?
those are letters of support from ana and her parents
as well as jesus and mariana .
jesus and mariana ?
yes . they would like to help you get off the list .
so ...
do you ... do you have any interest
in getting to know the twins ?
it &apos;s fine if you don &apos;t .
it &apos;s just i know that jesus ,
for one , would like to get to know you better .
i don &apos;t know how to be a parent .
well , he &apos;s not looking for a parent .
he has parents .
i would like to get to know him .
and her .
but , uh , i don &apos;t ...
really know what i have to offer .
thank you so much for doing this .
you &apos;re really , really saving my life .
i &apos;m so behind on my senior project .
it &apos;s my pleasure .
great .
do you mind if i record this ?
uh , no , no . of course not .
all right , so ...
tell me where you &apos;re from and how you grew up , i guess .
well , i was raised in evanston , illinois .
um , i &apos;m an only child .
um , i grew up in a middle class suburban home
with two loving parents .
so what got you interested in foster care ?
well , when i was about seven years old ,
a girl my age moved in with our neighbors .
her name was elizabeth , lizzie ,
and she became my ... my first bff .
i loved her so much that i gave her my mrs. beasley doll .
what &apos;s that ?
well , it &apos;s from this tv show when i was a kid .
it &apos;s called family affair .
and anyway , the youngest girl had this doll
that she &apos;d call mrs. beasley ,
and , like , every girl in america had to have one .
so what happened to lizzie ?
did they adopt her ?
no .
they wanted to .
but one day social services came and took her away .
why ?
well , they placed her back with her birth mom .
well , maybe she was better off .
not in this case .
lizzie &apos;s birth mom lost custody again , and ...
she went back into the system .
then we lost track of her .
that &apos;s awful .
yeah . you know what &apos;s really awful ? they ...
they wouldn &apos;t even let her take mrs. beasley .
i mean , they took her from a house
where she was happy and safe and loved ...
and they wouldn &apos;t even let her take her doll .
so , to answer your question ,
that is why i have dedicated my life
to reform the system .
for lizzie and for kids like her .
you are an amazing person .
so are you .
you &apos;re helping so many people
by telling your story and supporting this bill .
i actually , um ...
i have a friend who needs help .
she &apos;s got a daughter in foster care
and she &apos;s trying to get her back ,
but the judge won &apos;t give her custody
unless she gets a good @-@ paying job .
so , i ... i was wondering maybe ...
is there anything for her at your office ?
oh , i wish i could help , callie ,
but we &apos;re ... i mean , we &apos;re a really small operation
and there are just ... there &apos;s nothing available right now .
but , um ...
i mean , i &apos;ll keep that in mind .
yeah , thanks . i just thought i &apos;d ask .
thought i &apos;d surprise you and come check out the sets before work .
oh . well , the sets aren &apos;t much to check out right now .
i can hear you .
oh , i &apos;m aware .
hey , guys ! how &apos;s it goin &apos; ?
what are ... what are you doing here ?
uh , your mom said that you might need some help .
yeah , we do actually .
brandon , this is gabe .
this is jesus and mariana &apos;s birth father .
nice to meet you .
uh , you work in construction , right ?
uh , yeah . yeah , happy to help ...
if that &apos;s cool with you ?
uh , yeah . yeah , totally .
yeah . show me what needs to be done .
is it okay for him to be here ?
yeah ,
absolutely , as long as ...
as long as i &apos;m here to supervise .
hi , i &apos;m ...
i &apos;m stef . brandon &apos;s mom .
sorry , this is cort ... ney .
cortney . um , we work together at the smokehouse .
oh , that &apos;s right . you &apos;re one of the bartenders .
i thought i recognized you .
yeah .
i &apos;m just stopping in on my way to work
to check out the space .
so , i &apos;m thinking depending on how many people are coming ,
we could have two bar areas ?
i ... i think that &apos;d be ... good .
okay . i &apos;ll see if i can work out a deal with one of our vendors .
well , thank you so much for helping out .
yeah . um , nice to meet you .
nice to meet you !
uh ... okay .
well , thank you for coming by , and ...
you know , i &apos;ll ... i &apos;ll walk you out .
so thanks for ...
oh , it &apos;s fine .
i have a kid .
i &apos;m not exactly san diego &apos;s most eligible bachelorette .
that &apos;s not gonna be an issue .
seriously , my moms are cool .
i just haven &apos;t told them that i &apos;m seeing , like , anyone , so ...
but ... but i want them to meet you ,
like , really meet you .
okay . slow your roll .
i &apos;m not exactly ready to really meet the parents yet either .
why are you so perfect ?
you can say it . i suck .
no , you don &apos;t .
and it &apos;s not so bad .
i &apos;m gonna need a ...
a few cross pieces every 16 inches
unless you want your sister to fall through
in the middle of the play .
hey , don &apos;t tempt me .
you guys don &apos;t get along ?
we get along ... ish . you know how it is .
i mean , you said you had a sister , right ?
yeah .
yeah , we ... we fought i guess .
do you guys get along now ?
no , we don &apos;t talk .
after i went to prison , the family pretty much wrote me off .
and she &apos;s got kids , so ...
it &apos;s not like i can exactly go to birthday parties and stuff .
is ... is that ...
is that why you ... you never tried to see us ?
i mean , &apos; cause you couldn &apos;t ?
no .
look , i was 18 when ana told me she was pregnant .
wait , you knew ?
yeah .
yeah , but i was in prison and , you know , she was 15
and i told her to ...
you know , not to do it .
she was too young to have a kid ,
and i wasn &apos;t in any position to take care of one ,
and i didn &apos;t think that she could do it on her own .
and i was right .
being with her ,
choices i made to be with her ...
ruined my life .
nothing good came out of anything i did back then .
hey , jesus , it &apos;s time to go home , love .
wait , no , i still got a ton of stuff i gotta do .
well , i ... i can stay .
keep working .
really ?
yeah .
don &apos;t got anything better to do .
well , thank you , gabe . that &apos;s very nice .
appreciate it .
yeah , thanks .
oh . uh , the alarm arms itself on at 6 : 00 .
code &apos;s seven , eight , seven , nine .
okay . got it .
hey , babe ? can we have a word ?
uh , yeah .
what &apos;s up ?
we , uh , we wanted to talk to you about cortney , is it ?
uh , yeah . what ... what ... what about her ?
uh , well , i saw you guys kissing in the parking lot .
what , were you spying on us ?
no .
are you guys dating ?
yeah . yeah , we are .
i mean , i guess . you know , it &apos;s new .
and she &apos;s a bartender , so she &apos;s at least 21 , yeah ?
so ?
so you &apos;re 17 .
well , yeah , i &apos;m almost 18 , though ,
and she &apos;s just 21 .
okay , but that &apos;s still a three @-@ year difference .
well ... well , you &apos;re three years older than mama .
mama was 26 when we met .
okay , well , i &apos;m not ... i &apos;m not gonna stop seeing her .
no one is asking you to do that .
b , are you guys having sex ?
no .
okay , good ,
and since cort is older , we &apos;re asking you not to
until you are 18 , at least .
this is ridiculous .
hey , is it ?
gabe and ana were three years apart .
and he was arrested for statutory rape .
wait , so you &apos;re gonna arrest cortney
if we have sex ?
no ...
what about heavy petting ?
i mean , how far can we go before you throw her in a jail ?
okay , calm down . nobody is arresting cortney .
we just want you to be careful , brandon .
we want you to focus on school and on julliard .
i am focused .
i am . i ... i &apos;ve written music to an entire play
and ... and i &apos;m probably the only senior who &apos;s
almost done with his thesis project .
so i &apos;ve got it handled , okay ?
so , are we , like , done here ?
for now , yes .
i really don &apos;t see why he &apos;s being so mean .
i mean , he moved on with rockabilly barbie .
you know , zoey , junior ...
never met a cherry print she didn &apos;t like .
are you even listening ?
sorry , um ...
i &apos;m trying to track down
this girl justina was friends with
when she was little .
she got lost in the system and ...
i was thinking i could , like , reunite them .
well , what else did justina tell you about her ?
sometimes a specific detail can help .
&quot; mrs. beasley doll &quot; ?
yeah , it &apos;s a long story .
is that her ?
my mother was a drug addict .
the first time i was taken from her ,
i was two @-@ years @-@ old
and i was placed in several foster homes
until i was around seven when i was finally placed
with a loving couple
whom weren &apos;t able to have children of their own ,
and i made my first best friend there .
she gave me her mrs. beasley doll .
but one night ,
social workers came and took me away .
they didn &apos;t even let me take my doll .
wait , so ...
justina &apos;s a foster kid ?
justina is lizzie .
the friend that she told me about was her .
♪ because what i feel ♪
♪ there is no controlling this ♪
thanks a lot for telling zoey that i cheated on you .
i didn &apos;t .
then how did she know about wyatt ?
wyatt ?
well , maybe he &apos;s talking , but i &apos;m not .
well , zoey told nick
and now he &apos;s probably gonna break up with me .
so , you can thank your girlfriend for slut @-@ shaming me .
i swear , i didn &apos;t ...
i didn &apos;t say anything .
then tell zoey to keep her mouth shut .
do you remember karen , art teach from anchor beach ?
uh , vaguely .
yeah , she had breast cancer .
had a double mastectomy a few years ago .
oh , yeah ?
yeah , i ran into her in the hall today ...
and it occurred to me that
she might be someone you &apos;d like to talk to ,
you know , about reconstruction and your concerns .
how do you know she &apos;d like to talk to me ?
well , i also remembered that she was in a support group
and that she actually had a friend who ...
who opted to go flat .
&quot; go flat &quot; ?
yeah , that &apos;s the expression they use apparently .
and all this just occurred to you in the hall ?
okay .
love , i &apos;m really not into talking with total strangers
about this , you know ?
i know you &apos;re a private person
and you don &apos;t actually know these women , but ...
they &apos;ve been through what you have .
i don &apos;t ...
i don &apos;t know what to say or how to advise you ...
and i think you need to talk to someone who does .
if you &apos;re here to pile on , i already feel like crap .
no , i &apos;m not .
we all make mistakes .
i lost my virginity ...
to some guy i didn &apos;t even care about .
that &apos;s bigger than a mistake .
do you think i &apos;m a horrible person ?
no .
and ...
i have no right to judge .
why ?
have you ever cheated on someone ?
no , but ...
i &apos;ve done things that ...
i had sex with someone ...
and it was wrong ...
and i regret it .
but you just have to live with it and ...
carry on .
i knew right away that i wanted reconstruction .
i thought my husband would be happier ,
though he was totally supportive
of whatever decision i wanted to make .
thank you .
thank you .
i &apos;ve lived my whole life with breasts ,
so without them , i mean , personally , i just ...
i felt like i wouldn &apos;t feel whole .
and see , i personally didn &apos;t feel i needed breasts to feel whole .
i just didn &apos;t want more surgeries
with more possible complications , and ...
i didn &apos;t want anything artificial inside my body .
and see , i love my new boobs .
they are perkier than ever
and i haven &apos;t had any issues ,
and for the first time in my life ,
i can go bra @-@ less , so ...
so can i.
sometimes you just gotta laugh about it .
did you , um , i mean , did you ...
i mean , were you ever worried about people staring at you ?
well , i was , but , you know , people don &apos;t really notice .
yeah .
what &apos;d you , um , what did you do
about the ... about the ... about the nipples ?
i had them tattooed .
i didn &apos;t do nipples , but ...
oh , she has the most gorgeous tattoo
across her chest .
it &apos;s ... you should show them .
would you like to see ?
and i &apos;m happy to show you my implants .
i think that would be very helpful .
that is so beautiful .
what made you to decide to do a peacock ?
peacocks symbolize self @-@ expression
and confidence and immortality .
and i guess i like being reminded
that no matter what happens , life is eternal .
those look great .
yeah , they do . they look ... they look good .
nice .
and the nipples are ... are very dimensional .
yeah , i &apos;ll give you my guy &apos;s info .
he is a true artist .
do you wanna feel them ?
oh , i ...
oh , no , go ahead .
you can give them a squeeze .
yeah , sure .
let &apos;s ...
wow , those ... yeah , those ...
right ?
they ... they do feel really natural .
it &apos;s pretty amazing .
that &apos;s ... yeah .
lena ?
do you want to feel ?
i mean , you &apos;ll be touching them too .
sure .
they do feel really , really real .
jesus , it &apos;s not ... it &apos;s because ...
it ... it ...
it &apos;s a medical thing for mom .
i &apos;m so sorry .
this is ellen and , uh ,
you know karen from school .
so sorry .
it &apos;s okay .
so i went online last night .
i was trying to surprise you .
i was trying to find lizzie .
i think it &apos;s gonna be pretty hard to track her down .
because you &apos;re lizzie .
i , um , i founds this video
and in it , you were telling the same story .
her story .
why wouldn &apos;t you want me to know that you were a foster kid too ?
callie , i didn &apos;t tell you i was a foster kid because i wasn &apos;t .
i don &apos;t get it .
i used to go to these fund @-@ raisers all the time
and i would tell lizzie &apos;s story
and people would listen politely ...
but they were never moved by it ...
until one day , i told it as my own .
so , you lied .
the story is not a lie .
it happened .
and when i made lizzie &apos;s story my own ,
it not only opened people &apos;s hearts ,
but it opened their wallets .
so , that &apos;s why you need me .
you &apos;re using me and my story to get money from people ?
well , callie , money is what get things done .
without money , there &apos;d be no reform .
i mean , you can say that i &apos;m using you ...
but for good .
and you &apos;re using me too .
how am i using you ?
fost and found .
you need me to help you expand it ,
get it out there , right ?
and you need me to get your friend daphne a job .
i mean , if it &apos;s that important to you ...
i can do it .
nick ?
look ...
cheating on mat was just about the worst thing i &apos;ve ever done .
it was a mistake ,
one that i &apos;ll never make again .
i understand if you don &apos;t want to see me anymore .
look , i was just really surprised
at what zoey told me , and i ...
i don &apos;t like surprises .
hey , look , if you &apos;re ever not feeling ...
this anymore , then just be honest with me .
okay ? &apos; cause i &apos;d rather be hurt than surprised .
deal .
but i don &apos;t think you have anything to worry about .
come on .
there you go .
see ? fill mine up too .
do both of them . ready ?
what happened ?
what happened ? what happened ?
can you take one of the two of us ?
yeah .
okay . ready , tasha ?
that &apos;s it . big smile .
all right .
got it .
listen , tashi @-@ bear , i &apos;ll see you soon .
okay , baby ?
every time feels like it &apos;s gonna be the last .
thanks for the pictures . you know , in case ...
hey , no . you can &apos;t think like that .
i have to .
if the judge lets tasha &apos;s foster parents adopt her ,
it &apos;s not like they &apos;re gonna give me visitation .
okay , well , that &apos;s not gonna happen
&apos;cause i got you a job .
what ? where ?
with justina .
it &apos;s full @-@ time , 800 bucks a week
and , like , health insurance .
oh , my god .
oh , my god , oh , my god , thank you , thank you .
thank you .
yean , i &apos;m just gonna take pictures .
oh , right .
he asked .
you &apos;re really good at that .
we just , um , ran into each other outside .
yeah , i can ... i can see that .
hello .
how &apos;s it going ? uh ...
so the whole cast isn &apos;t here yet , but ...
it &apos;s no problem .
so you &apos;re looking for , like , a ...
yeah , i &apos;m kind of going for , like , a post ...
modern steam ...
modern steampunk thing . exactly .
so what can i do ?
paint . follow me .
listen . i wanted to thank you and your sister
for writing those letters for me .
i was , uh ...
it meant a lot .
don &apos;t worry about it .
you okay ?
you &apos;re usually a lot more chatty .
yeah , well , you don &apos;t like chatty .
in fact , i &apos;m pretty sure you don &apos;t even like me .
so why are you doing this ?
why would you think i don &apos;t like you ?
because you don &apos;t think anything good came from you and ana .
i mean , that &apos;s what you said yesterday , right ?
no , that &apos;s not ... look , i ...
i ... i didn &apos;t mean it like that .
look , i &apos;m not good at this .
i &apos;m here ... because i can &apos;t be your dad ,
but i want to get to know you .
and i want to ... i want to give you something .
and i &apos;m probably gonna say and do the wrong thing a lot .
you just got to tell me .
it can &apos;t get all pent up inside .
okay ?
all right , jesus , it &apos;s time to go home .
yeah . i &apos;ll go grab a bite
and come back later when nobody &apos;s here .
we &apos;ll get it done . don &apos;t worry .
okay .
is everything going all right ?
yeah . yeah .
okay .
thank you .
for what ?
for doing this .
oh , baby .
so i talked to zoey ,
and , um , i guess wyatt told talya
and talya told her , and , um ...
anyway , i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s not your fault , but ... thanks .
okay . you guys ready to do this ?
yeah .

let &apos;s do it again . yeah ?
hey , ma !

uh ... no , not really . how &apos;s the set building going ?
uh , you know , there &apos;s still a lot to do and time is short .

i , uh ...
i decided to get the implants .
do you hate it ?
oh , my god . i love it .
it &apos;s so sexy .
oh ! what inspired this change ?
look at you !
i think it &apos;s my own version of ... of ... of ellen &apos;s tatoo .
the peacock . i think it &apos;s , you know , my ...
my symbol of confidence .
i &apos;ve always wanted to cut my hair really short .
well , why haven &apos;t you done it until now ?
&apos;cause i was afraid i was going to look like a dyke .
i hate that i have my own internalized homophobia .
but , um ... just really been struggling ,
really been struggling with ,
with ... the way people are going to look at me without breasts .
as if i , uh ... as if i &apos;m somehow less of a woman ,
less feminine .
but you know what ?
breasts and long hair do not make me a woman .
and what the hell do i care if people think that i &apos;m butch
because they have an idea
of what a woman is supposed to look like .
i just ... i just ...
i just want to look the way i want to look .
and letting go ... letting go of that fear ,
i guess , just ...
i &apos;ve never felt more feminine .
so ... and i &apos;m gonna need implants &apos; cause i like having boobs ,
not because i &apos;m not me without them .
i love you so much .
i love you too .
and fyi , um , this hair is getting me a little ...

about how you wish you could take it back .
i wasn &apos;t talking about you .
yeah , right .
i was talking about dani .
dani ?
yeah , my dad &apos;s girlfriend .
my dad had already broken up with her ,
but she came by the apartment and ...
i was there , um ...
i &apos;d had a few beers ...
and i had sex with her .
brandon , that wasn &apos;t sex .
she took advantage of you . it &apos;s like liam , it &apos;s rape .
statutory rape , it &apos;s not the same , okay ? i never said no .
it was still wrong .
she was older and you had been drinking .
does anyone know ?
moms and ... and my dad .
dani was arrested .

i thought what happened with liam was my fault too .
i felt ...
like ashamed and ugly .

you okay ?
it wasn &apos;t until you ...
that i could be with someone ...
the way you &apos;re supposed to , without the shame and the guilt ,
at least in the moment .
i don &apos;t want to regret that .
