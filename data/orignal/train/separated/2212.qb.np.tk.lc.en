chin , what &apos;s the matter ? you know this guy ?
yeah , his name is gabriel waincroft .
he &apos;s my brother @-@ in @-@ law .
what i should do is throw you off this damn roof !
i should do the same to you
for not protecting my sister .
you murdered my father , you son of a bitch .
tell me why !
delivery .
you see , this is a chess game to him .
he just sent us a very clear message
that he is moves ahead .
i &apos;d like to , uh , introduce you to inspector abby dunn .
san francisco pd &apos;s putting together
a task force based on what we do .
aloha .
hi .
i like you , chin , i ...
i really like you .
i like you , too , abby .
but i &apos;d much rather have this conversation in person .
except i &apos;m in san francisco right now .
work stuff .
okay , it &apos;s @-@ it &apos;s all there .
let me see my brother now .
deal &apos;s a deal .
matty .
matty , it &apos;s me .
want to take him with you ?
or would you prefer that we ship him ?
there &apos;s my boy !
come here .
mama !
hey , ma .
hello , handsome .
mm , so good to see you .
we all deserve nice things .
an escape from the bland , the mundane , the vanilla .
what you &apos;ve seen here today can be your escape .
the mau loa vacation club is offering
an exclusive opportunity for timeshare ownership .
and if you sign up with us today ,
you , too , can live the dream .
shall we ?
he &apos;s very good .
yeah , yeah , he &apos;s great .
you know , &quot; timeshare ownership &quot; is kind of like an oxymoron .
‭ you know , you basically get a fancy hotel room
with a mortgage payment-- that &apos;s all it is .
does someone have a question ?
no , no , my husband was just remarking
on how beautiful the place is .
mr. williams .
let me paint this picture for you .
okay .
the sun &apos;s melting into the pacific .
you &apos;ve got a bottle of domaine chandon etoile rosé on ice ,
and this beautiful wife of yours in your arms .
can you imagine anything more romantic than that ?
no , no .
you @-@ you can put the paintbrush down for a second .
honey , i need to speak to you alone if that &apos;s ...
no , no , don &apos;t be rude , sweetheart . it &apos;s okay .
just @-@ just carry on . we &apos;re re ... we &apos;re good .
clara , now . i need to speak ,
i got to speak to her right now , you understand , right ?
see ? come on .
excuse us .
we &apos;ll be right back .
sorry .
promise .
ma ?
yeah ?
make it stop . it &apos;s over .
please , i don &apos;t want to do it anymore .
you promised .
yeah , i did . i promised .
i promised that i would pretend i was dad
so you could get tickets to a cruise .
to where , i have no idea .
okay , but you @-@ you promised me
that it would only take one hour .
we &apos;ve been here for four hours .
four hours is nothing .
do you know how long i was in labor with you ?
36 hours !
not to mention , every saturday ,
all those little league tournaments .
remember those ?
driving all over the tri @-@ state area ?
i sacrificed for you .
so man up and pretend that we &apos;re married ,
because i am not leaving here without that cruise-- got it ?
i got it .
you &apos;re gonna be on a cruise ,
i &apos;m gonna be in therapy , ma .
about time .
ma ... ?
fix him .
please ?
hey , what do we got ?
so , our victim &apos;s a john doe .
he was brought in doa ,
multiple gunshot wounds to the chest .
what about the guy who brought him in ?
his name is neil palea .
csu swabbed his hands .
no trace of gsr .
doesn &apos;t look like he &apos;s our shooter .
well , what &apos;s his connection to the vic ?
mm , he wouldn &apos;t tell me .
what , he &apos;s refusing to cooperate ?
not exactly .
hey , neil ...
this is commander steve mcgarrett .
remember i told you about him ?
he needs to ask you a few questions , okay ?
my uniform is stained !
i can &apos;t show up for work like this .
i need to go home and change !
okay .
no problem .
&quot; neil &quot; like neil armstrong ?
first man on the moon .
commander armstrong &apos;s left boot hit the lunar surface
at precisely 2 : 56 coordinated universal time .
yes , sir .
&quot; one small step for man , one giant leap for mankind . &quot;
&quot; one small step for a man . &quot;
acoustic analysis confirmed the missing syllable .
really ?
did you know that ?
no .
i didn &apos;t know that , either .
you know , neil , i really just wanted to , uh ,
ask you about the guy you brought into the hospital today .
was he a friend of yours ?
what was his name ?
mark .
mark .
thank you .
you know what his last name was ?
i already told you his name .
we &apos;re late for work .
oh , you and mark worked together ?
ah , where was that ?
hey , neil , mark was , mark was hurt .
real bad . he died .
and i want to find the person who did it ,
so i need you to tell me what you saw .
do you know who hurt mark ?
okay , neil , that &apos;s okay .
neil came to us about five years ago
after his mother passed away .
he &apos;s highly functioning and capable of a lot ,
but like anyone on the spectrum ,
he &apos;s had his difficulties .
social interaction , for example .
neil doesn &apos;t really have friends .
that &apos;s why mark was so important to him .
you know , i &apos;m wondering if , uh ,
the reality of mark &apos;s death has actually sunk in yet .
well , neil processes trauma differently than you and i.
his routine is very important to him .
and mark was part of that routine .
every day , neil would take the bus to mark &apos;s house
and they would drive to work together .
and on saturdays , they &apos;d play konane .
a disruption of that routine
may be more difficult for him than mark &apos;s death .
hey , neil .
you know , janet was just telling me that , uh ,
you go by mark &apos;s house every morning before work .
did you go there today ?
yes .
he was hurt .
yeah .
yeah .
can you take me to mark &apos;s house ?
no .
i &apos;m one hour and 47 minutes late for work .
i &apos;m gonna be in trouble .
neil ...
remember what we talked about .
sometimes schedules can change .
now , commander mcgarrett needs your help .
no .
no ! i have to leave !
i have to close p @-@ 2 at 9 : 00 p.m.
very important !
how about this , neil ? what if we make a deal ?
what if you show me where mark &apos;s house is ,
and i promise you i will get you to work before 9 : 00 p.m.
number six bus .
okay .
at the coffee shop , make a right .
it &apos;s the house with the blue mailbox .
blue mailbox .
all right , buddy .
hey , kono , uh , stay with neil for a minute ?
yeah , copy that .
five @-@ 0 !
clear !
clear .
valuables are untouched .
this wasn &apos;t a robbery .
it was an execution .
vic &apos;s name is mark walker .
looks like he was heading to los angeles .
and he was planning on taking neil with him .
one way tickets purchased this morning .
these guys were in a hurry to get out of town .
yeah , but who were they running from ?
neil , how you doing ? you okay ?
you promised you would take me to work .
you can &apos;t break a promise !
nope . no , you &apos;re right .
i &apos;m not gonna break a promise , neil .
we &apos;re gonna go to work , okay ?
we &apos;re going to work .
i just , i gotta ask you one question .
did mark say anything about you guys going to los angeles today ?
no , no more questions .
you told me you would take me to work .
okay , all right .
okay , let &apos;s go to work , neil .
come on .
let &apos;s get you to work , buddy .
okay .
all right ?
neil , i gotta just say good @-@ bye to my friends over here .
is that okay ?
okay ?
all right , we get anything else on the vic ?
yeah , we found out that mark has an ex @-@ wife
and a daughter on the island .
we &apos;ll reach out , see if they know anything .
yeah , but until we find out
who murdered mark or what he was into ,
we &apos;re gonna have to assume that neil &apos;s in danger .
all right . look , i promised i &apos;d take him to work , okay ?
so i &apos;m gonna ... i &apos;m gonna hang with him for a while tonight ,
see if i can maybe build up some trust .
maybe he &apos;ll tell me a few things
and fill in the blanks , you know ?
yeah .
why does the crime scene clean @-@ up guy
look like gerard hirsch ?
because it is gerard hirsch .
hirsch , what are you doing ?
what @-@ what is this ?
well , since you took away my livelihood , i &apos;ve had to adapt .
after seeing how busy you all were ,
i figured i should , uh , feed off the teat , as they say .
thanks for that image .
charming .
i see you &apos;ve been in business since &apos; 82 , huh ?
1982年起开始从事犯罪现场清理
there &apos;s nothing wrong with a little white lie .
my customers like to feel that they &apos;re in experienced hands .
ah , instead of the hands of an ex @-@ art @-@ forger-
turned @-@ waikiki @-@ caricature @-@ artist .
i don &apos;t see your better half .
where is the lovely inspector abigail dunn ?
don &apos;t tell me you two have broken up already .
she &apos;s in san francisco on business .
and don &apos;t change the subject .
how did you know that we were here ?
i got a police scanner .
the early bird gets the blood splatter .
it &apos;s &quot; spatter . &quot;
whatever . point me to the carnage .
yeah , uh , early bird .
you &apos;re too early , okay ?
csu hasn &apos;t even finished processing the scene .
when they finish , we &apos;ll call you , okay ?
who &apos;s the new guy ?
i got to go , all right ?
yeah , me too .
well , uh , give me a call
when the place is ready to be cleaned .
or for any other , uh ... needs you may have .
are you implying sexual needs , gerard ?
um , sure .
i &apos;ll pass .
for now .
i don &apos;t know how many ways i can say no .
he @-@ he just doesn &apos;t listen .
i know , they &apos;re all the same , they &apos;re all the same .
they lure you in with a prize ,
and then they hit you with the hard sell .
mr. and mrs. williams , it &apos;s your lucky day .
i bet .
i just got off the phone with my manager .
and he &apos;s agreed to release that primo third @-@ floor unit
at a special discounted rate .
but we need to lock this deal up tonight .
okay , look , um , uh , we really appreciate the effort .
uh , you &apos;re doing a fantastic job .
the pocket square &apos;s phenomenal .
but , anyway , we &apos;re not gonna ... no timeshare .
we &apos;re not gonna get involved in it ,
uh , today , tomorrow , anytime .
no timeshare .
so , uh , if we could get those cruise tickets
and end this very long day , that would be fantastic .
mr. williams ...
it &apos;s clear to me why your wife loves this place .
she &apos;s a sophisticated woman with impeccable taste .
mmm . do you really want to disappoint her ?
if we get the cruise tickets , yes , i can live with that .
i have to say , i am surprised .
mmm . i mean , you struck me as a kind of man
who would do anything to keep his wife happy .
i mean , think about it , mrs. williams .
‭ every morning , waking up with the pacific ocean
calling out to greet you .
the warm , salty air tickling your naked skin .
okay , that &apos;s enough .
that &apos;s my mother . no more , okay ?
what ?
yeah , my dad couldn &apos;t make the trip .
it &apos;s not a big deal , but that &apos;s that .
it &apos;s , uh , it was all a sham , okay ?
it &apos;s over now .
daniel .
what ?
seriously ?
but you still have money , right ?
we split up about six months ago .
mark had a bad gambling problem .
he bounced around jobs for a little while ,
and that &apos;s why he ended up working at the garage
a year and a half ago .
no one else would hire him .
did he ever talk about neil ?
yeah , they were pretty close .
he liked the fact that neil didn &apos;t judge people .
did he ever mention anything about taking neil
on a trip to los angeles ?
not to me .
we were barely in touch until a week ago .
and what happened a week ago ?
mark showed up .
wanted to tell me about some trust
that he was setting up for our daughter .
ma &apos;am , if you don &apos;t mind my asking ,
how much money did he leave your daughter ?
well , i haven &apos;t gotten any paperwork yet ,
but , knowing mark , it couldn &apos;t have been that much .
ooh , boy , was his ex @-@ wife wrong .
i looked into that trust .
mark wired a hundred grand into his daughter &apos;s account .
all right , well , that &apos;s a lot of money
for a guy who makes 12 bucks an hour .
maybe ... maybe he &apos;s coming off a big gambling win or something .
uh , no chance , his ex @-@ wife said he was addicted .
if he was still in the game , he &apos;d be in it till he was broke .
okay , well , wherever he got that money ,
it could be what got him killed .
all right , i &apos;ll call you back .
what &apos;s going on , neil ?
it &apos;s 8 : 58 , and it takes me two minutes to walk down to p @-@ 2
and set up the cones .
what &apos;s going on , neil ? why are you closing this down ?
i can &apos;t talk about it .
i have to go .
they &apos;re gonna be here .
who &apos;s gonna be here ?
neil , who are you waiting for ?
mark said not to talk about it .
it &apos;s top secret .
okay .
well , i &apos;m impressed .
this definitely took some skill .
yeah , whoever did this
tunneled at least 20 yards ,
then had to get through three feet
of steel @-@ reinforced concrete ,
and that was before they got to the five inches of solid steel .
you said nothing was taken ?
cash is all accounted for .
safety deposit boxes were all untouched .
they literally walked in , hit the emergency release ,
and walked right out the door .
who breaks into a vault to get inside a bank ?
as crazy as it sounds , it does make sense .
see , our security office is right outside the vault .
from there , you can shut down the bank &apos;s entire alarm system
without tripping any surveillance cameras or motion sensors .
yeah , all right , mr. fuller ,
we &apos;re gonna need to see all the , uh , security footage , please .
that &apos;s not possible .
the thieves deleted it .
right .
well , do either of you have any idea what they were after ?
we have customer records and files ,
but we checked , and everything &apos;s accounted for .
what about the private offices ?
miss koha and i checked both ours .
nothing &apos;s been disturbed .
and the employees in all the other offices
say nothing &apos;s missing .
okay , and how many people know
about the security layout in here ?
maybe a dozen people .
all right , we &apos;re gonna need to question all of them .
we &apos;re also gonna need full inventory
of @-@ of the bank offices .
of course .
hey , guys .
yeah , uh , keep us posted , please .
so it looks like mark used his key card
to let the crew in every night at 9 : 00 p.m.
for the last six nights .
any cameras in the garage ?
yeah , but every night from 8 : 55 p.m. to 5 : 00 a.m. ,
the cameras at the entrance and on p @-@ 2 were conveniently down .
i think i might have an idea where mark got the money
for his daughter &apos;s trust .
right , he was their inside man .
for 100k , he gave &apos; em access to the garage
and a guarantee that he would look the other way
when they dug their tunnel .
probably made assurances that he could keep neil quiet too .
i &apos;m thinking , at some point , mark must have realized
that he and neil were both loose ends
and that the crew was gonna clip them once the job was done .
which is why mark wanted to skip town with neil .
all right .
am i in trouble ?
no , no , you &apos;re not in trouble .
you were given a set of instructions ,
you followed them , end of story .
what story ?
uh , no , what he means is--
that &apos;s it , there &apos;s nothing more to say .
then why don &apos;t you say that ?
i don &apos;t know . i , uh ...
i don &apos;t know , you &apos;re right .
neil , you &apos;re right ,
and @-@ and i ... and from now on , i will say that .
but right now , we need to ask you about the guys
who have been coming here every night .
i &apos;m not supposed to talk about it .
yeah , i know , i know , but , you see , the thing is
we really need you to .
neil , we think those are the same men who killed mark .
we need to find them before they hurt someone else .
are they gonna hurt me ?
no . no , no , no , no .
no one &apos;s gonna hurt you , neil .
no one &apos;s gonna hurt you , but , uh , you see ,
the thing is you &apos;re the only one who &apos;s seen them ,
so we need your help .
can you tell us how many of them there were ?
four .
okay . all right . do you know their names ?
no .
can you describe what they look like ?
he broke the rules .
who broke the rules ?
every night he &apos;d smoke in the stairwell .
i told him once , &quot; it &apos;s not allowed . &quot;
he got very angry .
after that , mark said i should not talk to him .
okay , can you tell us what that man looked like ?
it &apos;s okay .
what about the cigarettes he smoked , neil ?
can you tell us what kind of cigarettes he smoked ?
i @-@ i picked them up after my shift ,
but i didn &apos;t throw them away .
i thought someone could see them and report it .
yep , well , you did the right thing . can i have those ?
thank you . thank you .
would you get these to eric right away ,
see if he can pull some dna ?
you did real good , neil .
you did real good .
thanks , ma .
it &apos;s , uh ...
it &apos;s an interesting , um ...
sandwich there , ma .
there &apos;s no , uh , there &apos;s no condiments--
no mustard , no mayo .
you didn &apos;t , uh ,
cut off the crust , like you know i like .
ma ?
i see .
you &apos;re , uh , you &apos;re upset with me
&apos;cause i blew the , uh , cruise tickets
and now you &apos;re giving me the silent treatment , right ?
just stealing a page out of your playbook , sweetheart .
what @-@ what does that mean ?
well , when you were growing up
and i did something that you didn &apos;t like ,
you froze me out .
right . i @-@ i mean , i was a little child .
you &apos;re an adult woman .
it &apos;s very mature , though .
yes , well , how does it feel ?
how does it feel ?
i don &apos;t know .
definitely doesn &apos;t taste good , though .
detective williams .
yeah .
i &apos;m special agent kang with the fbi .
i &apos;d like to speak to your mother clara .
about the timeshare ?
no , it &apos;s about your brother matthew .
my brother matthew ?
matthew &apos;s been dead for over a year .
what , uh , what do you want to talk to my mom for ?
just need to ask her a few questions .
uh , okay , uh ...
but now is , um , not a good time .
my @-@ my kids are on their way over .
later today is fine .
see you then .
all right .
give you a call .
do you have any idea
why the fbi would want to talk to you about matty ?
matty ?
no , i have no idea .
all right .
okay .
one orange soda with a blue straw .
i like your models .
thank you .
you know , i , uh , i actually served on this one a few times .
the uss enterprise .
got a lot of fond memories .
we called her the big e.
oh . that was her nickname .
you know , neil , you probably already know this ,
but this ship was a tracking station for ...
for the friendship 7 space capsule .
it was used in the third mercury mission .
astronaut john glenn was the pilot , and on that mission
became the first american to orbit the earth .
that &apos;s right , neil .
can i pick it up ?
you &apos;re supposed to ask permission
before you touch someone &apos;s things .
yeah . yeah . have at it .
that &apos;s pretty cool , huh ?
hey . our stairwell smoker .
we got an i.d. on him .
all right .
hey , neil , can you , uh ...
can you do me a favor ?
okay , so , eric processed the cigarette butts
that neil collected .
we got a dna hit on this guy--
tyson vargas .
he did two years at halawa for robbery .
was paroled six months ago .
hey , neil , is that the guy
that , uh , that you saw smoking in the stairwell ?
yeah .
clear .
nothing to indicate they fought back .
these guys were taken by surprise .
i got vargas over here .
neil said there were four men .
i &apos;m thinking this is the entire heist crew .
or maybe there &apos;s a fifth man
and this is a double @-@ cross .
if not , then whatever they stole from the bank
really pissed somebody off .
liver temperature puts tod
at approximately 11 : 00 a.m. this morning .
as for the cause of death , well ...
that should appear obvious .
additionally , our victims suffered extreme abrasions
and various premortem contusions .
well , if they were tortured before they were executed ,
maybe they already gave up what they stole .
you know what , that supports your fifth member
of the crew theory , and if that &apos;s the case ,
that means neil still might be in danger .
kono , do me a favor .
take him back to his apartment
and have hpd put a full security detail on the place
until all this is done .
copy that .
max , we gotta i.d. of these guys right now , please .
sam liliha .
leo cruz .
and finally , we have paul koha ,
in our system for armed robbery and aggravated assault .
paul koha .
you recognize that name ?
yeah , the assistant manager at the bank ,
ella koha .
well , i &apos;m guessing that &apos;s not a coincidence .
ella , your brother was part of the crew that robbed your bank .
all right ? which means you had to have been involved .
it wasn &apos;t like that .
it wasn &apos;t ?
then tell us how it was .
i found out that mr. fuller was laundering money for a client .
which client ?
i don &apos;t know . i swear .
the funds were spread out across dozens of falsified accounts .
i found out he was keeping records
and account numbers in his office safe .
i told my brother about it
and he said we &apos;d be taking money from someone
who probably stole it themselves .
no one would get hurt .
we could drain the accounts
and my manager , mr. fuller ,
wouldn &apos;t be able to report it to the police .
well , that explains why they ignored all that cash in the vault .
they &apos;d have to carry all that money .
the account numbers would be worth more .
how much money did your brother and his crew steal , ella ?
$ 94 million .
where &apos;s the money now ?
i transferred it to an offshore account .
all right .
so whoever executed the crew
is looking for that money .
was mark a bad person ?
no .
sometimes people make bad decisions .
it doesn &apos;t change the fact
that mark was your friend and that he cared about you .
wait a minute . what could the fbi possibly want with your mother ?
i have no idea .
why do you think i &apos;m calling you ?
did you ask her ?
of course i asked her .
what kind of stupid question is that ?
why you getting mad at me ?
&apos;cause i don &apos;t have time for the obvious , okay ?
i gotta drop my mom at the feds
in 20 minutes and i have no idea why .
stop . you want me to come down there ?
i &apos;ll come down there , all right ?
no , that &apos;s very nice of you ,
but you got your hands full .
hey , you know what ?
you could use those @-@ those cruise tickets
and flee the island .
that &apos;s very funny , steve .
i actually would do that ,
except for the fact that i didn &apos;t get the cruise tickets .
hey , well , listen , i @-@ i gotta go .
before my mom ends up on america &apos;s most wanted .
okay , listen , you need me , i &apos;m here , all right ?
thank you very much .
apb is out on fuller .
we got units stationed at his home and at the bank .
the thing is ,
his car is parked at his house
and his cell phone has been turned off .
seems he knows we &apos;re looking for him .
well , we &apos;re not the only ones .
i mean , whoever fuller was laundering money for
is now out , just under 100 mil ,
so i &apos;m pretty sure they &apos;d like a word with him , too .
aloha , colleagues !
that &apos;s a stretch .
hirsch , what are you doing ?
you &apos;re not supposed to be here .
rules are meant to be broken .
i &apos;ve spent my entire life in an industry
where conventional wisdom
is constantly challenged by the avant @-@ garde .
what are you talking about ?
i &apos;m not really sure , to be honest .
but i @-@ i did find something
that might interest you .
first , i need to know that i &apos;m &quot; your guy &quot; &quot;
i wet your beak , you &apos;ll wet mine .
just to be clear ,
did you just threaten to withhold evidence
unless we give you a &quot; first call &quot; guarantee ?
is that what just happened here ?
your words . not @-@ not mine .
well , here &apos;s a few more words :
obstruction of justice .
message received .
good .
while i was cleaning the tyson vargas crime scene ,
i discovered this laptop .
the lid was closed .
your geek squad just dusted it .
got some unusable partials ,
but the real prize was inside the cracker jack box .
what does that even mean ?
check it out .
on the outside , spotless .
but inside ...
beaucoup blood .
that computer was open when that crew was executed .
so the shooter comes in looking for his money .
he checks the laptop and sees a zero balance .
right , which means there could be some usable prints on this thing .
yeah . i &apos;ll have the lab process the inside of the laptop .
oh , i hate saying this : good work , hirsch .
oh , what do you know-- a compliment .
hpd just grabbed fuller at the airport .
they &apos;re bringing him in .
all right , good .
mrs. williams , on april 19 , 2011,
agents from the new jersey field office paid you a visit .
your son matthew had been on the run for months
and the fbi wanted to know if he had made contact with you .
right . and i &apos;ll tell you what i told the agents then .
i had not spoken to matty for well before he disappeared .
are you aware that lying to a federal agent is a felony ?
what ... what @-@ what @-@ what is this ?
ask your mother . she should recognize it .
it &apos;s a bank statement
showing a balance of nearly $ 50,000 .
okay . so what ?
detective , your brother opened this account
in your mother &apos;s name after he became a fugitive .
we &apos;ve been monitoring it ever since .
we had no proof that she was aware of the account
until a couple weeks ago ,
when she withdrew $ 700
to purchase a plane ticket to hawaii .
mrs. williams , the only way you &apos;d have known about this account
is if you had been in contact with your son .
that &apos;s not true .
then how do you explain this ?
because a couple of months after we lost matty ,
the bank called and told me about the account .
i don &apos;t know when he deposited the money
or how he even got it .
i only used it so that i could come
and visit my son and my grandchildren .
all right , ma , you don &apos;t have to say anything else .
look , she didn &apos;t know .
i &apos;ll pay back the $ 700 .
that &apos;s it , we &apos;ll call it a day , okay ?
while that &apos;s a generous offer , detective .
it doesn &apos;t change the fact
that we can still arrest your mother for obstructing justice .
for ... a @-@ are you kidding me ? my ...
this case should have been closed
when my brother was murdered .
what @-@ what is ... what is ...
what &apos;s going on ? what is this about ?
mrs. williams , i &apos;d like a minute with your son .
you &apos;re free to go .
no , i @-@ i &apos;ll walk her out . come on .
i &apos;m so sorry .
ma , not here . come on .
you would have made me turn him in .
i know , i know . it &apos;s okay .
i would have done the same thing if it had been you .
i know . you did the right thing , okay ?
and i promise i would have done the same thing .
it &apos;s okay , ma , come here .
i love you .
i love you too .
okay , one more time , mr. fuller--
who were you laundering the money for ?
okay , when you were planning your little getaway ,
our techs did some digging into the bank security system .
you know , they found out , apparently ,
you were telling the truth about
the surveillance video being scrubbed .
what you neglected to mention
was that you were the one that scrubbed it .
almost three hours after the break @-@ in .
right , you saw the video of the break @-@ in .
you recognized ella &apos;s brother .
then you send somebody to execute him and his crew
and get the money back .
i want a lawyer .
oh , he wants a lawyer .
oh , well , the best lawyer in the world
ain &apos;t gonna keep you from spending the rest of your life in jail .
guys ...
crime lab got a print off that laptop .
belongs to gabriel waincroft .
lucky day !
this is gonna go quicker than we thought .
all right , so we now know
that you &apos;ve been laundering money for gabriel waincroft ,
which means we also understand
why you haven &apos;t been telling us anything ,
because you &apos;re scared of him .
and you should be .
so , go ahead , you can play tough guy with us all you want .
he &apos;s gonna kill you .
he &apos;s gonna kill you .
soon as he finds you .
and even jail won &apos;t protect you from that .
he &apos;s right .
unless we get to him first , though .
how do you think you &apos;re gonna do that , huh ?
well , that &apos;s where you come in to it .
where the hell have you been ?
tracking down your cash .
my assistant manager ella has it .
where is she now ?
i just spoke to her .
she &apos;s at home .
send me her address .
i can get your money
and i can meet you anywhere you want .
that &apos;s not necessary .
just give me the address .
i have everything under control .
i &apos;m not gonna let you guys use me as bait .
okay , ella , the guy you stole from ,
he knows who you are .
and he can get to you anywhere .
you want to stay alive , you help us catch him .
steve ...
i got her .
i think she &apos;s right .
listen , no one wants to catch gabriel more than i do .
but we ran this play once before ,
and the bait ended up getting stabbed 28 times .
we &apos;re tracking gabriel .
we got a lock on his cell . i say we go in now .
that &apos;s too risky .
that &apos;s too many variables that we can &apos;t control .
all right ? but we bring him to us ,
we have the tactical advantage .
all right , kono , we &apos;re in position .
all good here .
eta on gabriel ?
he &apos;s heading south on punahou , a block away from king .
should have visual in a few seconds .
hold on , guys . the signal just went dark .
hey , if gabriel killed his phone ,
that means he must know he &apos;s walking into a trap .
guys , i have a visual on our target and four hostiles
moving on your location from the east side .
gabriel knows we &apos;re here .
all right , kono , hold your position .
copy that .
lock yourself in the bathroom ,
lie down in the tub and stay there .
no matter what happens out here ,
don &apos;t come out unless i tell you .
guys , we &apos;re gonna go floor by floor ,
split this building into thirds , shoot anything that moves .
don &apos;t do it .
don &apos;t do it !
girl ... i love you !
love you , too .
you okay ?
i will be .
where is he ? where &apos;s gabriel ?
he &apos;s where he belongs .
you ... have been asking me ...
the same exact questions
for the last two hours .
my answers are not gonna change , okay ?
i was not in contact with my brother
and i did not help him in any way .
i find that hard to believe .
yeah , i know .
you and your brother were close .
in fact , you were the last person to see matt
before he fled the country .
and with all the resources at your disposal
as a member of five @-@ 0,
you &apos;d have done everything in your power
to locate and assist your brother .
right .
smile all you like , detective williams .
we both know it &apos;s true .
no , i &apos;ll tell you what we both know :
is that you , my friend , just showed your hand .
this is not ab ... about a bank account .
someone &apos;s pulling the strings here ,
i &apos;m just ... i &apos;m just not sure who .
this is definitely not about my brother . it &apos;s about me ,
it &apos;s about five @-@ 0 , it &apos;s about the people that i work with .
am i right ?
it &apos;s okay . don &apos;t answer .
you . you got something you want to ask me ,
just come on out , ask me , okay ?
this isn &apos;t going anywhere .
maybe not .
but this task force has crossed the line before
and they will again .
you just need to be there when it happens .
yes , sir .
you all right ?
yeah , i &apos;ll make it .
we had him .
