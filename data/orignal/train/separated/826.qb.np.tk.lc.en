and he &apos;s playing his forehead like a piano .
will you clowns focus ?
my waffle is in the toaster ,
and if i wait too long after it pops ,
it &apos;ll get hard .
look , i know about relationships .
winston can vouch for me .
that girl , kc , just texted him ,
&quot; what &apos;s up ? &quot;
that riddler .
so i had him text back
an empty bubble .
is he thinking about her ? or is a baby playing with the phone ?
she don &apos;t know , but she want to know .
there she is . there she is .

as a section musician for the met .
oh , has alan taken a liking to her ? oh , bravo .

he is not good .
winston , get back here !
we need to powwow about may and coach !
winnie &apos;s gonna need a minute .
what are you reading ? what is ...
one woman &apos;s journey up inside herself ?
it &apos;s really inspiring . i actually want to be
the woman in this book .
&quot; finding inner strength in a time of crises . &quot;
cece , are you in crises ?
i &apos;m fine . cece &apos;s fine .
how are you ? how &apos;s fawn holding up ?
if you must know , my paramour councilwoman fawn moscato
has been so strong since the incident .
you know , reporters are calling it panty @-@ gate .
there &apos;s pictures of her naked lady @-@ bottom
all over the internet .
sid , put the phone away .
you picked it up right when i said &quot; naked lady @-@ bottom . &quot;
please .
you guys are good , then ?
you know , &apos; cause the last time we spoke ,
you said you were feeling a little , you know , used .
well , not anymore . we &apos;re a team now .
fawn and schmidt .
fawmidt .
vomit ?
no , fawmidt .
you &apos;re saying the word &quot; vomit . &quot;
no , i don &apos;t hear that , but okay .
fawn &apos;s holding a press conference later today ,
and i don &apos;t mean to toot my own shofar ,
but i &apos;ll be standing there right by her side .
so this scandal is actually bringing you two closer together .
team fawmidt has never been stronger .
i heard it there .
wow , that sounds exactly like &quot; vomit . &quot;
that &apos;s a problem .
&quot; roughly the same length as the pearl . &quot;
how is that a pull quote ?
and that ...
is how babies get made .
it &apos;s gross , right ?
how does the sperm find the egg ?
propelled by its tail ,
the sperm travels up the canal until it reaches the egg .
now , for us , it &apos;s only a couple of inches ,
but for mr. sperm there
it &apos;s miles away .
miles and miles and miles away .
it &apos;s almost like ...
why would the egg want to be so far away from the sperm ?
you know ? like , didn &apos;t the egg and the sperm
have a great time together ?
and then you &apos;re just gonna pack your bags and leave
and go to new york ?
to play music with some other sperm .
you &apos;re just @-@ just gonna leave ? you &apos;re gonna leave your sperm
and go play music with other sperms ?
and i &apos;m cool with that ! i &apos;m cool with that !
you know , i got eggs . i have eggs on deck !
this sperm got swag . all those other sperms
ain &apos;t got swag like me . can any other sperm
sport this much green and still look dope ? no !
that ain &apos;t tight ! this is tight !
this is tight !
i just want you to come back , and i ...
i guess i chose the wrong day to observe health .
i miss her !
may !
listen , thanks for standing next to me up there , ponyboy .
i hope this show of remorse
will keep these reporters off my back .
oh , i know it will . and then , you know what ,
once this is over , maybe we get out of here
for a little bit . lay low ,
rent a cabin in the woods ,
read some poetry , have horizontal sex .
okay , two of those three things sound like fun .
now , here &apos;s your statement
in case you &apos;re asked any questions .
i &apos;m not gonna need a statement . i &apos;m a seasoned improviser .
hey , guys . we &apos;re the belly laughs .
so , i need a location .
how about fat camp ?
that &apos;s adorable . but just , please , read what i wrote .
i will . but i &apos;m not gonna do it until i get out there .
you &apos;re gonna want me in the moment for this .
okay .
good afternoon .
um , before i answer any of your questions ,
my partner would like to read a statement .
honey .
i am a sick man .
on saturday last , councilwoman moscato
was caught not wearing underpants because i ...
i asked her not to wear them .
why ?
because it turns me on .
what i did was wrong . i &apos;m so sorry , fawn .
i &apos;m sorry , los angeles .
and i &apos;m sorry to the man upstairs ,
my lord and savior jesus christ .
dress shirts on a monday ?
you know how it is .
coach breaks up with a lady , we take him out ,
and he gets loaded .
yeah ,
i know how it usually goes
when coach breaks up with a girl , but may is different .
sometimes she comes over and they don &apos;t even have sex .
i don &apos;t get that .
trust me , i am right about this ,
just like i was right about them fighting .
i &apos;m on , like , a streak here . i might just be ...
an expert in love . like a ...
you know , like a love doctor , if you will .
i will not . you are the least qualified person
to call themselves a doctor of love .
exhibit &quot; a &quot; : you dated me .
i rest my case .
court is adjourned .
guilty as charged .
put ... i would stop that .
case ...
rested . listen , i got to say
i agree with nick on this one , jess .
i mean , it &apos;s been a whole day ,
and kc still hasn &apos;t texted me .
well , that &apos;s just proof that the bubble is working .
look , you guys , coach needs to talk to may .
trust me . he is in pain .
i &apos;m happy and i &apos;m healthy and i &apos;m ready to party !
let &apos;s get drunk !
you &apos;re wrong .
coach .
do you want to talk about what happened today or ...
talk about what ?
no .
hey , um , actually , can you do me a favor ?
may &apos;s gonna be recording later .
she &apos;s gonna stop by and pick up her rubber circle .
may has a diaphragm ?
no ,
it &apos;s the thing that you put on the floor
to stabilize the cello .
condom .
no .
no , it &apos;s the thing you put on the floor
to make sure the cello stays put .
cello stabilizer .
oh , yeah . cello stabilizer .
oh . well , wouldn &apos;t you like to be here when she comes by ?
no , that &apos;s gonna be hella weird . i want to party ! yeah !
i &apos;m gonna do this and gonna do this ,
this , this , this , this .
what was that speech ?
i &apos;m sorry , okay ? i told you to read the statement beforehand
and then you told me that terrifying story
about doing improv at a fat person &apos;s camp .
i didn &apos;t know that the statement
was gonna blame me for panty @-@ gate .
and by the way , for your information ,
the belly laughs did not &quot; do &quot; improv .
we reinvented it .
i know you must be embarrassed ,
but ... you saved me .
yeah , well , people think i &apos;m a sicko now .
one of your aides spit at me .
was it shallon ?
yeah , that &apos;s a lisp , but still , he &apos;s fired .
look , if you want to leave , i completely understand .
but the truth is ...
i can &apos;t do this without you .
well , now ponyboy is feeling very conflicted .
just one last photo op .
you and i having a lovely evening .
show the press everything &apos;s back to normal .
and then i promise it &apos;ll just all be about us .
could we do horizontal sex ?
yes .
with foreplay ?
it &apos;s a deal @-@ b ... it &apos;s a deal @-@ breaker . it &apos;s a
uh ... yeah .
deal @-@ breaker .
okay . fine , yes , fine , yes .
oh , god . no , please . oh ...
oh , god .
may .
cece !
so coach and may broke up ?
long story short ,
they shouldn &apos;t have broken up
and i am the only person that sees this .
i realize i &apos;m kind of an expert in love .
a love doctor , if you will .
where are your crackers ?
a @-@ above the fridge .
cece , did they raise your tuition again ?
why are you so hungry ?
i &apos;ve decided i &apos;m going to climb mount shasta .
by yourself ?
i &apos;m leaving for three weeks .
i want to be like the woman in the book ,
i want to go on a climbing trip and find myself .
okay , um ... ceec ,
are you sure you &apos;re ready for a climbing trip ?
jess , i just ... i can &apos;t sit here
and watch schmidt with fawn .
and i don &apos;t think they &apos;re breaking up any time soon , so ...
cece , they &apos;re never gonna last .
he doesn &apos;t really love her .
did he tell you that ?
no , but ...
as a doctor of love , i sense these things .
the love doctor just knows .
may . hi .
uh , i &apos;m here for my endpin anchor .
yeah .
ah , thank you .
very sorry to hear about the breakup . are you okay ?
um , yeah . yeah .
i &apos;m here to talk if you ever need to . in hard times ,
it &apos;s nice to have a friend , may .
thanks ... jess . right ?
yes .
well , uh ...
i &apos;m in the middle of a recording session .
i got to get back to the studio , so ... see ya .
bye .
yeah , jess , she looks real broken up about it .
i ... i &apos;m a mess .
i know !
the doctor is in .
wait , what ?
nothing . cry it out .
i have never seen coach go this hard after a breakup , man .
you sure he &apos;s okay ?
it &apos;s good , it &apos;s good , it &apos;s good .
you treat an outside wound with rubbing alcohol ,
you treat an inside wound with drinking alcohol .
that &apos;s science .
i feel that , man .
it is time to turn things up .
sidney--
do what you do !
this is my jam .
we &apos;ve only been dating for a few months .
i just thought that ...
that breaking up was , like , the smart thing to do , you know ?
i know you &apos;re upset , sweetie ,
but i ... i can &apos;t understand
anything you &apos;re saying with the crackers .
do you love him ?
i think i do .
well , then , maybe moving to new york doesn &apos;t mean
you have to break up .
so you think that i should ... that i should
ask coach to move with me ?
okay , how about we put down the crackers ?
i think she wants coach
to move to new york with her .
oh ! yes , yes ! i mean ...
yeah ? you @-@ you ... you think that he would say yeah ?
yeah .
definitely .
he &apos;s crazy about you .
he had a meltdown today in health class .
now , the kids did learn that sex is emotionally complicated ,
so it was a good class , but trust me ...
what jess is trying to say here is that if you ...
if you really know how you feel about someone ,
you need to act now .
wow . am i really doing this ?
yeah , but not before we clean your face ,
&apos;cause it &apos;s caked in snot .
ooh , yeah , coach !
who you think he &apos;s gonna hook up with ?
it &apos;s a tough monday crowd . it ...
it &apos;s nearly impossible to say , but
i &apos;m gonna go with the white bodysuit
and , uh , the leopard print leggings .
she looks smart to me .
no way . no way . my money &apos;s on the one with the wedding ring
whose husband is clearly over there in the corner spying on her .
yeah , he &apos;s not happy about that .
oh , oh , ooh ! dora the explorer
女主角朵拉是个七岁小女孩
just entered the scene !
you &apos;re tiny . i like it .
there she g ... oh ! for the kiss !
oh ! the winner , the winner .
what the hell ?
oh . may &apos;s here . coach .
may here , she here .
wh @-@ wha ... uh , may ,
wh @-@ what are ... what are you doing here ?
no , come on .
no , no ...
in case you were wondering , she , uh ,
she did get her little
rubber holder thing .
coach , um , i wanted to apologize .
not now , honey .
he needs some time , honey .
i brought over a beer .
we &apos;ll take that beer .
give us that beer , honey .
sorry .
i &apos; m not a freaking love doctor .
i &apos;m dr. e.d. ote .
dr. idiot .
yeah , i get it . i just never understood
the whole love doctor thing , anyway .
i guess i was just hoping that with all the mistakes i &apos;ve made ,
at least i could help you guys find love .
that i didn &apos;t go through all that for no reason .
yeah , but no one has the answers , you know ?
it &apos;s love , it makes no sense . it &apos;s messy .
there &apos;s no such thing as a love doctor .
you know what , cece ?
go on your trip . go get over schmidt .
don &apos;t listen to me .
i &apos;m gonna climb that mountain .
yeah , i &apos;m gonna do it . i &apos;m gonna do it .
but i &apos;m not gonna do it for schmidt ,
i &apos;m gonna do it for me .
good . go .
i love you , girl .
love you , too .
hey , don &apos;t smile . don &apos;t smile .
look sadder that you &apos;re buying underpants .
underpants make you very , very sad .
oh , i hate being here so much .
these underpants make me so uncomfortable .
that &apos;s perfect . there &apos;s that fat boy improv training .
now , next ,
i &apos;m going to ask for something with a little more coverage .
you &apos;re gonna flip out , say you can &apos;t take it anymore ,
and leave the store . then tomorrow
we enter you into some kind of rehab facility .
when you get out we &apos;ll announce that we &apos;re getting married .
married ? what ? i don &apos;t ...
shh . yes . shh . yes , yes . okay ,
so what i say is we build on this momentum , okay ?
and we get married .
i know it &apos;s not the most romantic idea in the world ,
but we &apos;d be happy .
and then , we play our cards right ,
you and i are living in the mayor &apos;s mansion by 2020 .
fawn . fawn .
no .
no ? oh , n @-@ no to some of it ?
no to all of it . we can &apos;t get married . i barely even know you .
you ... you know me .
the real you , fawn .
this is the real me .
i &apos;m a politician , not in the vagina monologues .
i mean , what do you want ?
i can get you anything you want .
you &apos;ll be rich , i &apos;ll be powerful .
i &apos;m realizing ...
just now that it &apos;s not what i want .
i don &apos;t want any of that .
i want to be in love .
i want to be ... i want to be crazy in love .
okay , well , certainly don &apos;t quote beyonce
and then pretend like you just thought of it .
uh , uh , i want to be drunk in love .
but that &apos;s also a beyonce lyric .
come on , fawn .
you &apos;re not really in love with me .
i &apos;m not really in love with @-@ with you .
we just look great together buying underpants .
are you breaking up with me ?
i guess i kind of am .
well , um ...
i don &apos;t want this
to come out the wrong way , but ...
does this mean i lose your vote ?
never .
i just can &apos;t stand to be in here any longer !
surrounded ...
by these underpants !
red ones and yellow ones and blue ones and pink ones !
and this woman with her brassiere / teddy .
underpants everywhere ! they &apos;re driving me nuts !
i feel like i got underpants all over my body !
schmidt out . this is ridiculous .
enough is enough . get out of here , paparazzi .
no , leave me ... get @-@ get out of my way , sir .
i just want to say something .
no .
and then i &apos;ll leave .
look , i &apos;ll never get involved in your personal life ever again .
okay ? because i have no idea what i &apos;m talking about .
and i know that now .
you could just ... you could just troll for basic bitches
at the juice bar , and i will say , mm , nothing .
okay ? so , look , i was wrong , and i &apos;m sorry .
i do love her .
i &apos;m crazy about her .
yes ! i was right !
love doctor ! i &apos;m back .
really ? i thought it was just a regular break @-@ up .
but in all fairness , i hadn &apos;t thought about it that hard .
i mean , what do i do , man ?
you know , it &apos;s like she &apos;s going to new york .
yup .
i can &apos;t go to new york with her . that &apos;s crazy .
you know ? i like my sun on the right and my ocean on the left .
it &apos;s a rule of mine .
plus , i &apos;d have to leave you guys .
can &apos;t leave you guys , i mean ,
i finally have a home .
all right , flash forward to the future .
40 , 50 years .
you &apos;re married . kids , grandkids .
i &apos;m long dead .
naturally .
of course .
and you look over to the woman sitting next to you .
and she &apos;s gray .
she &apos;s old .
she has that , like , grandma smell .
you have a grandpa smell , but you got ...
grandmas always smell like ...
like right when you open a cupboard .
yeah , she has that smell , but ...
... you love her .
be honest with yourself .
is that fat old lady sitting beside you ... mm ...
honestly , right now , in my head , i &apos;m just picturing , like ,
a beanbag chair with a wig on it .
okay . we have gone too much into the description .
okay . yeah , yeah , yeah .
is that may ?
i think so .
well , that &apos;s big .
let &apos;s go get her .
yeah ?

do it .
... a mess of fat ,
loose skin hanging , i have boobs ,
and you &apos;ve got hair on your face ...
holding my rock sack while i &apos;m sitting on the toilet
so it doesn &apos;t fall in the water .
what are you saying ?
i &apos;m saying , as you get older , your testicles lengthen .
no , what i &apos;m saying is i love you .
and that i would be a fool
if i let you leave to new york
without even fighting for us .
ernie ...
i love you , too ,
but i ... i can &apos;t stay here .
i don &apos;t want you to stay here .
look , i know we haven &apos;t been dating that long ,
and , um , this might seem crazy , but i was won ...
