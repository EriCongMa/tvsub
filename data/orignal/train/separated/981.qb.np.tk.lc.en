desperate housewives s07 e04
bree discovered she had a romantic rival .
i &apos;ve been looking for a new hobby ,
and taking you down is as good as any .
susan got a bonus .
for the girl who gets the most hits in a month .
since the prison didn &apos;t allow conjugal visits ,
this is our wedding night .
paul &apos;s bride said no .
there are certain wifely duties that i don &apos;t want to rush into .
once we call these people , it &apos;ll change your family forever .
and gaby decided to meet her real daughter .
call them .
carlos solis loved his wife
more than anything ...
if there &apos;s a woman on this planet with better skin ,
i &apos;d like to meet her .
even though she was vain ...
do we have to give money to the church every sunday ?
i mean , it &apos;s always the same show .
selfish ...
i told you to buy me couture !
i can &apos;t wear off @-@ the @-@ rack with these shoes !
and spoiled .
but in those moments
when his wife was simply vulnerable ...
you okay ?
carlos loved her just a little bit more .
this is where we &apos;re meeting them ?
i think so .
i don &apos;t know what i &apos;m supposed to say .
start with &quot; hello . &quot;
and then what ?
&quot; thanks for raising our daughter for the last eight years .
hope we didn &apos;t ruin yours &quot; ?
it &apos;s gonna be fine .
mrs. and mrs . solis ? i &apos;m hector sanchez .
nice to meet you . and please , call us carlos and gabrielle .
oh , thank you . uh , where is ...
juanita is at the swing set with her sister .
we thought we should talk a little first .
oh . sure .
uh , my wife is over here with our ...
she &apos;s with grace .
that &apos;s her name ? grace ?
yes .
so how are you and your wife handling all of this ?
we &apos;re still in shock .
since your lawyer called us ,
we haven &apos;t been able to sleep or eat .
this whole thing is so crazy .
we feel the same way .
they couldn &apos;t have switched our babies .
it &apos;s got to be a mistake .
maybe we should take a blood test .
mom !
i told you to bring the green jacket !
i can &apos;t wear red with these shoes ! ugh !
yes , carlos solis loved his wife ...
i don &apos;t think we &apos;ll be needing that test .
and he knew her d.n.a. when he saw it .
it &apos;s called a purse ,
and as every woman knows ,
it can hold just about anything ,
from a personalized cell phone ...
to a romance novel ...
to much @-@ needed medication .
whatever you find inside ,
there &apos;s one thing you can be sure of--
every purse says something about
the woman who owns it ...
whether she knows it ...
or not ..
carlos and i feel like we shouldn &apos;t tell the girls ,
you know , about what happened .
what do you guys think ?
we should protect them .
yes , but since we wanna get to know
our biological daughters ,
we were thinking maybe the families could
get together every now and then ?
maybe once a month ?
mm , that sounds reasonable .
uh , w @-@ what do you think , carmen ?
um , i guess .
look at them .
yes , i have a feeling
that they will become very good friends .
can you believe those are our daughters ?
grace looks just like me when i was her age .
and juanita looks so much like my mother .
mommy , can i have money for ice cream ?
you just had lunch .
but they have chocolate chip .
grace .
oh , let her have some . it &apos;s hot . come on . it &apos;ll be my treat .
your purse is beautiful .
i know . would you like to hold it ?
it &apos;s so soft . i bet it cost a lot , right ?
grace , you don &apos;t ask about money .
i &apos;m sorry .
oh , that &apos;s okay , sweetie .
and just so you know , it &apos;s chanel .
you can have one of these by working very hard ...
or by marrying a man who works very hard .
thank you !
what a polite little girl .
you have obviously done a wonderful job , mrs. sanchez .
i mean , we didn &apos;t know what to expect ,
but i can see grace couldn &apos;t have had a better mother .
you know what i mean .
uh , y @-@ you &apos;ve done a wonderful job with juanita .
thank you . you know , when i got pregnant ,
i didn &apos;t know how i would handle the whole motherhood thing ...
mom .
but i think i turned out to be pretty good at it .
mom !
what ? !
i need money for ice cream .
what is the magic word ?
i don &apos;t know . &quot; hurry &quot; ?
now come on . the truck &apos;s pulling away .
&quot; please . &quot; the magic word is &quot; please . &quot;
fine . please .
what , we can &apos;t afford more than one scoop ?
i &apos;m sorry . what was i saying ?
you were talking about what a good mother you are .
say good @-@ bye to your truck loan .
god , can you believe it ?
just two months ago , we were up to our neck in debt .
now we &apos;re only up to our ass .
if we keep this going ,
we could reach flat broke in time for christmas .
hello ? it &apos;s maxine .
um , uh , i &apos;m in here with mike !
it &apos;s open !
hello , michael !
look at this punim .
oh , mike , if i was 15 years younger ,
i &apos;d ride you like a hobo rides a boxcar .
thanks . but you still have to fix the air conditioner .
eh , it was worth a shot .
i &apos;m gonna take a shower .
i need to talk some business with you .
me , too .
i just bought a fur @-@ trimmed teddy and some floor polish .
tomorrow is gonna be a heck of a show .
fantastic .
i think you should quit .
what ?
the web site &apos;s going through some changes .
i &apos;ve taken on some partners
who are pumping a lot of cash into the business ,
and they &apos;re running the show now ,
and they want a huge u.s. presence .
no . no , no , you promised me
that no one here would ever see me .
i did , and that &apos;s why you need to get out now .
but mike and i are just getting back on track .
yesterday , we got our first water bill
that didn &apos;t come with a threat .
honey , i &apos;m sorry .
well , how long do i have till all this happens ?
a couple of weeks , a month tops .
okay . i &apos;ll work right up until the last day .
give me double shifts , extra shows . i &apos;ll do anything .
you got it .
i &apos;m gonna miss you , honey .
no one will ever wear
the rubber gloves and the fishnets like you do .
okay , we get it . you &apos;re unhappy .
we got it in every aisle at the market ,
we got it four times during the night ,
and we get it now !
mom , i &apos;ll put the groceries away .
oh . no .
stop . freeze .
do nothing . no sudden movements .
the eyes are closing .
but we bought ice cream .
let it melt .
hello ? hello ? yes , this is she .
oh . of course i did .
thank you . thank you . i @-@ i will be back .
everything okay ?
no , i left my license at the store ,
so i have to drag paige back there ,
which will lead to another 2 @-@ hour screaming fit .
if i didn &apos;t look so good in that photo , i &apos;d get a new one .
why don &apos;t you leave the baby with me ?
oh , honey , i don &apos;t know .
mom , you leave her with the boys ,
and they don &apos;t change her diaper
until it weighs as much as she does .
good point .
i &apos;m back .
i &apos;m back ! everything okay ?
she woke up , so i went with plan &quot; b. &quot;
you traded her in for a quieter baby ?
nope . i changed her diaper .
now we &apos;re doing a little floor time .
you changed her diaper .
where &apos;d you learn how to do that ?
i &apos;ve seen you do it a hundred times .
you &apos;re so good with her .
how would you feel about me taking a quick shower
to wash some of this vomit out of my hair ...
from yesterday ?
why don &apos;t you take a bath ? light one of those scented candles .
whoever raised you did a brilliant job !
shoot .
i &apos;m out of aspirin .
do you have a headache ?
uh , no . my back is a little sore .
you do realize , darling , that your back wouldn &apos;t hurt so much
if you weren &apos;t sleeping on a couch every night .
uh , n @-@ no . uh , the couch is fine .
um , i just pulled a muscle .
hey there .
lee .
congratulations .
you are the proud new owner of your old house .
you bought your old house ?
actually , lee , why don &apos;t we talk later ?
okay . well , here are your keys ,
your complimentary endangered species calendar ,
and a kitchen magnet with my face on it .
yes , i know i look cross @-@ eyed ,
but they assure me they will correct that
in the next batch .
enjoy .
why would you buy that house ?
i thought we &apos;d be here at least for a year .
i thought it was a good investment .
but why buy ... that one ?
there are other homes for sale around here .
escrow &apos;s closed , beth .
i see no point in discussing this further .
you won &apos;t discuss it ?
i &apos;m your wife .
isn &apos;t it convenient how during the day you &apos;re my wife ,
but at night ,
you turn back into a houseguest ?
no , no , no . don &apos;t look at them yet . they &apos;re not done .
this isn &apos;t about the shutters . it &apos;s about our ... date friday .
you still haven &apos;t told me what we &apos;re doing .
well , i can &apos;t tell you yet ,
but i &apos;ve been working on something
that i &apos;m pretty ... stoked about .
well , that sounds lovely .
i , too , am ... stoked .
you got a little paint ...
what are you doing ?
are you spying on bree again ?
why would he want her when he could have me ?
she &apos;s way too old for him .
you &apos;re the exact same age .
i am not . i &apos;m only thirty--
are you gonna lie about your age ?
we were college roommates .
all right , damn it .
besides , bree &apos;s always looked young .
when she used to go out with her grandkid ,
people would think he was her son .
wait . bree &apos;s a grandmother ?
how did i not know this ?
okay , sweetie , i am taking the baby over to gaby &apos;s .
the girls are meeting for poker . i &apos;ll be back in a few .
you &apos;re not staying ?
no . i &apos;m really just doing a drive @-@ by .
last week , paige spit up on gaby &apos;s couch ,
so now she &apos;s pretty much baby non grata .
why don &apos;t you just leave her with me ?
then you can stay for your game .
but we usually play for a couple of hours .
give me a kiss . mwah .
so ? you &apos;ll be right next door if i need you .
oh , don &apos;t toy with me .
i &apos;m operating on two hours of sleep . i &apos;m vulnerable .
go . we &apos;ll be fine .
i love watching my baby sister .
it &apos;s fun .
penny lynn scavo ,
you are officially my favorite . mwah !
we are gonna leave everything to you in our will .
keep in mind we &apos;re poor ,
so it &apos;s rely more of a symbolic gesture .
listen , guys ,
uh , before we start ...
i &apos;ve been keeping something from you ,
but i &apos;m gonna tell you
because you &apos;re my dearest and oldest friends .
well , i &apos;ve only known you two weeks ,
but i don &apos;t want to be rude and tell you to leave .
see this picture ? this is my daughter grace .
oh , my god . gaby .
i can &apos;t imagine what you &apos;re going through .
i &apos;d be out of my mind . how can you function ?
well , we were knocked sideways at first ,
but since we met grace , it &apos;s been a blessing .
thank god the parents are lovely .
i mean , this is the kind of thing you see on the news .
who else knows about this ?
very few people ,
and i need you guys to keep it that way .
well , of course we &apos;ll be discreet .
definitely , for juanita &apos;s sake .
oh , don &apos;t worry about me .
up until today , i thought you were juanita .
so ... tell us what it was like .
amazing .
i looked into her eyes
and felt that pull .
well , you carried her for nine months .
there &apos;s this one thing she did that was incredibly moving .
she came up to me ...
and within two seconds of touching my bag ,
she knew it was expensive .
now that is a hallmark moment .
you don &apos;t understand .
when i was a kid ,
i used to sneak &quot; vogues &quot; out of my aunt &apos;s hair salon
and make my own high fashion paper dolls .
i know what it &apos;s like to be that kid ,
with her face pressed against the department store window .
grace is me at her age .
so i decided to do something for her .
her own little starter chanel .
you are the best mother ever .
paul ?
paul ?
what are you doing ?
please go home .
i just wanna understand , that &apos;s all .
are we going to move here ?
no .
then why would you buy this house ?
it must be filled with so many unpleasant memories .
i don &apos;t see any unpleasant memories .
i see the couch
where my wife and i would sit and have our morning coffe .
i see the christmas tree in the corner by the fireplace .
i see the chair
where i would sit and read stories to my son .
i was loved in this house .
i had a real marriage here .
our marriage is real , paul .
it &apos;s just ...
this is hard for me ,
and--and you keeping things from me
doesn &apos;t make it any easier .
you &apos;re right .
there should be no secrets between us .
secrets are why this house is empty right now .
sorry i &apos;m late , but i think you &apos;ll be happy
when you hear why .
black eyed peas . row 15 , center .
how cool is that ?
wow , that &apos;s just ...
you like them , right ?
of course .
you sound a little ... underwhelmed .
no . not at all .
i live to rock .
you know , i &apos;m not as old as you might think .
grandma !
surprise !
what are you doing here ?
visiting . we &apos;re here all weekend .
um ... hello .
hi . keith ,
this is my daughter danielle and this is my--
her , uh , son benjamin .
danielle , this is my , um ... friend keith .
we were just ... going out .
grandma ! grandma ! look what i bought you !
it &apos;s slippers .
my grandma has bad circulation . don &apos;t you , grandma ?
please stop calling me that !
you ... precious child .
you know what ? you guys came all this way .
you should spend tonight together .
no . no , no , no . if--if you guys had plans , you should go .
we &apos;ll be fine .
bree , there &apos;s--there &apos;s nothing more important than family .
we &apos;ll go out another time .
you &apos;re very sweet .
nice meeting both of you .
uh , thank you so much .
uh , i guess i heard wrong .
you seem to be bouncing back just fine .
what are you talking about ?
when your friend called ,
she said you were having a hard time since orson left .
uh , by any chance ,
is this friend named renee ?
she sent us first class tickets .
i wish i had a friend like that .
oh , trust me , you don &apos;t .
oh , come on . come on .
what the hell ?
maxine , pick up .
they &apos;re already putting up a billboard .
you--you said they weren &apos;t gonna start advertising
for a couple of--oh , my god !
wait ! wait ! stop ! huh ?
you--you can &apos;t put that up there ! that &apos;s me .
so ?
so--so people will see !
my friends will see !
lady , with a body like that ,
no one &apos;s even gonna notice you have a head .
no , no , no ! no , no ! you can &apos;t ! no , stop ! oh !
what the hell are you doin &apos; ?
protecting my dignity !
hey there , mrs. mmcclusky .
nice day , isn &apos;t it ?
i &apos;ve seen better . what do you want ?
you &apos;re direct .
i love that about you .
truth is , i was wondering
if you had any interest in selling your home .
well , get ready to love me again .
no .
aren &apos;t you tired of caring for this place--
the big lawn and all these stairs ?
yeah , your concern is touching .
what &apos;s your game here ?
i just love this neighborhood so much ,
i &apos;d hate to see this house fall into the wrong hands
after you &apos;re gone .
i &apos;m not going anywhere .
i hope you &apos;re right ,
but the years do have a way of flying by ,
and i thought you might wanna unload this place
while you still have the upper hand .
upper hand ?
yes .
right now you &apos;re sharp as a tack .
but one day , your hip will break
or you &apos;ll suffer a massive stroke ,
and the doctors will say you can
no longer live on your own .
and when that day comes ,
potential buyers who don &apos;t care about you like i do
will know that you &apos;re desperate .
they &apos;ll smell the blood in the water .
people will start smelling your blood
if you don &apos;t get off my porch .
all right . didn &apos;t mean to upset you .
my offer still stands .
as i said ,
it all comes from my great love for this beautiful neighborhood .
be careful on those stairs now .
oh ! look who &apos;s missing her big sister .
there . you are really so good with her .
listen , i &apos;m gonna take a quick jog .
be back in 20 minutes .
mom .
yeah ?
i &apos;ve got a test today . i cannot be late for the bus .
i hear you loud and clear .
i &apos;ll be back in 15 .
you might wanna smell her diaper .
i think she left you a little present .
hey , lynette ?
um , i need to talk to you .
sure .
oh . you &apos;re jogging again .
where &apos;s , uh , the baby ?
uh , penny is watching her . it is the most amazing thing .
only when you &apos;ve spawned as much as i have .
do you learn the glorious truth--
the older ones can watch the younger ones .
babies having babies-- bad .
babies raising babies-- genius !
i &apos;m happy for you .
you don &apos;t look happy .
that &apos;s why we need to talk .
okay .
she flew them here first class ?
that is vintage renee .
yes , a voracious libido and unlimited funds--
a deadly combination .
and now she &apos;s taking keith to dinner tomorrow night .
how did you find that out ?
well , he called to make sure it was okay--
which , course , it isn &apos;t . but what could i say ?
don &apos;t say anything .
wait till she &apos;s crossing the street and then run her over .
no , i &apos;m too fond of my car .
you have to fight back somehow .
it &apos;s the only thing renee understands .
but how ? i mean , you know her better than i do .
what could i do to humiliate her ?
she once slept with a rodeo clown ...
but he &apos;s a senator now .
oh , she &apos;s got this really weird belly button .
but by the time he finds that out ,
they &apos;re already getting it on .
she used to freak out whenever &quot; the wizard of oz &quot; was on tv .
why ?
mm , i think it was the munchkins .
there &apos;s something about little people
that gives her the heebie @-@ jeebies .
oh , crap ! penny &apos;s gonna be late for school .
sorry i couldn &apos;t help .
oh , no . you helped .
penny !
i &apos;m sorry ! i forgot my phone !
uh , grab your stuff , and i &apos;ll drive you !
what ?
where &apos;s my baby ?
stop breathing on my sister !
hi . i &apos;m lynette scavo .
i need to find my daughter penny .
yeah . we &apos;ve been expecting you .
principal &apos;s office is in the back .
oh . thank you .
you &apos;re in so much trouble .
so ...
you left your 2 @-@ month @-@ old baby
in the care of your 11 @-@ year @-@ old daughter .
what can i say ?
i &apos;m not one of those helicopter parents .
come on .
give me a break . i am raising five kids .
you have no idea how hard that is .
eight ?
well , clearly , you &apos;re very competitive .
i talked to penny .
i think you should know
she &apos;s helping you out more than you realize .
what do you mean ?
do you know penny takes the baby monitor to bed with her
so she can get up for the feedings ?
she does ?
as a result ,
the poor girl is exhausted .
she fell asleep in social studies yesterday .
i had no idea .
oh , my gosh .
yes , i will talk to penny when she gets home ,
and i will fix this .
yes , that would be nice .
okay .
you know what ? enough with the judgmental tone .
come on . who among us is a perfect mother ?
gaby .
is everything okay ?
yeah . yeah , everything &apos;s fine .
i was just hoping grace would be home .
i thought we were supposed to call first
if we wanted to see the kids .
i know , i know , but i was in the neighborhood .
uh , is she here ?
no .
okay . well , could you give this to her for me ?
thank you , but grace already has a purse .
really ? is it chanel ?
no . we bought it at a flea market for $ 2,
and she &apos;s very happy with it .
i know , but don &apos;t you think she &apos;d like this one a little better ?
not if she never sees it .
don &apos;t you think i would like to give my children nice things ?
we &apos;re not like you .
we can &apos;t afford luxuries .
we can barely afford the necessities .
look , if you guys need help ...
what we need is for you to let us be who we are ,
not who you are .
goodbye , gaby .
please , call next time .
you said i had a month .
i said i thought it was a month .
it &apos;s the internet . everything moves very fast .
how many billboards are there ?
they talked about a big ad campaign ,
so i guess a lot .
you have got to call them .
get them to stop it , or at least put some other girl up there .
something !
honey , i tried to warn you .
it &apos;s beyond my control now .
please help me .
what if mike sees me splayed across that billboard ?
he &apos;s gonna recognize those panties !
he gave them to me for our anniversary !
i &apos;ll make a call .
i &apos;m sorry i took the baby to school .
i had a math test , and i didn &apos;t want to be late .
hey , sweetie . hey . hey .
you didn &apos;t do anything wrong .
i did .
come here . sit down .
i understand you &apos;ve been taking the baby monitor
into your room at night .
just so you can sleep .
i appreciate that ,
and i appreciate how often
you have been looking after your little sister .
well , i know how you like to go see your friends
and go jogging and stuff .
yeah , i do .
and you &apos;re different when you get to do those things .
you laugh more . you &apos;re not as cranky .
you stay up late and play board games with us .
i like that mommy better .
i like that mommy better , too .
but it &apos;s not your job to take care of me .
your job is to ...
watch television and eat way too much candy .
and my job is to make sure that &apos;s all your job is .
okay .
off you go .
that ...
was really sweet .
i know .
get me a nanny .
what ?
i am drowning here .
you heard what penny said .
i &apos;m not myself anymore .
and when i &apos;m not taking it out on the kids ,
i &apos;m taking advantage of them . so i need help .
how about if i pitch in more ?
oh , tom .
what a lovely , hollow offer
that you &apos;ll never back up .
get me a nanny .
you bought an 8 @-@ year @-@ old girl
a $ 1,400 purse ?
oh , listen up . it &apos;s not like i got her the matching wallet .
so what did carmen say ?
she went all &quot; grapes of wrath &quot; on me ,
&apos;cause god forbid that woman let her daughter have nice things .
&quot; that woman &quot; is her mother ,
and i &apos;m with her on this .
you have no right to give grace expensive gifts .
yes , i do .
why ?
because she was supposed to have all this stuff !
we were supposed to give it to her .
this is why i didn &apos;t want us to look for her ,
because we had no idea what would happen once we found her .
but you looked , and we met her ,
and now we &apos;re falling in love with this girl .
and if you spook these people ,
they can take her away from us forever .
morning , mrs. mccluskey . how are you today ?
i feel great . sorry to disappoint you .
oh . oh--what ?
just had my annual physical .
doc says i &apos;m gonna be around for years .
so you can tell that vulture husband of yours
he &apos;ll have to pick at someone else &apos;s carcass .
what are you talking about ?
something smells good .
i &apos;m making stew .
so ... how was your day ?
fine .
anything interesting happen ?
no , not really .
you didn &apos;t ...
talk to anyone ?
who would talk to me ?
i &apos;m gonna go wash up .
you are going to love the sea urchin .
looks a little sketchy .
most of the fish i eat
comes in a basket with fries .
you &apos;re funny .
and you eat out of a basket .
i like that .
everything okay ?
i just thought i saw ...
never mind .
so ... anyway ,
i thought after dinner we could go to a club .
what do you think of jazz ?
i think it &apos;s the sea urchin of music .
okay , um , did you see that ?
see what ?
it was probably nothing . um ...
i thought i saw--
okay , you &apos;re ...
you &apos;re just a kid .
what is the matter with you ?
i &apos;m so sorry .
i don &apos;t want you to think i &apos;m odd .
y @-@ you see , when ... i was a child ,
there was this incident
at the circus .
and ever since then ,
i have always been terrified of--
hey ! don &apos;t i know you ?
get him away ! get him away ! get him away !
what &apos;s wrong ? !
is he there with his tiny hands ?
i can &apos;t look at his tiny hands !
i am--i am so sorry .
i don &apos;t know what the hell she &apos;s doing .
it &apos;s okay .
obviously , i made a mistake .
oh , my god . did he go ? i can &apos;t look .
he &apos;s gone .
so come down .
everyone is staring .
you should &apos;ve seen the look on her face .
well , i couldn &apos;t see her , but i certainly heard her ...
and it was magnificent .
happy to help out . bye , bree .
see ya in church .
$ 9,000 ?
hey , my partners spent a lot of money
printing those billboards .
and they &apos;ll agree not to put them up ,
but they are not gonna eat the cost .
honey , i did the best i could .
i talked them down from $ 12,000 .
it &apos;s still a huge hit .
i mean , it puts us right back where we were
before i started doing this stuff .
i know .
and what &apos;s mike gonna say when he notices
the money is missing ?
oh , god . i hadn &apos;t even thought of that .
maybe i should just let them put up the billboards .
at least then when he kills me , i &apos;ll be famous .
you know , there is another way .
what do you mean ?
well , you could earn that money back , and fast , too .
but you &apos;d have to ...
never mind . forget i said anything .
no , no . what ? what--what is it ?
well , there are other services our web site provides--
things i &apos;ve kept hidden from you
because of the boundaries you &apos;ve set .
but if you &apos;re willing to go
beyond those boundaries ...
are you talking about prostitution ?
god , no !
nothing like that !

of a ... racier nature .
how racy ?
how much money do you wanna make ?
how dare you .
good morning , renee .
how dare you exploit a traumatic childhood memory .
yes , i heard you had some sort of episode with a little person .
oh , look . he followed you home .
very funny . i wonder how keith will react
when i tell him it was you who ruined our date .
about the same as when he finds out
you used my grandson to ruin ours .
oh . here &apos;s keith now .
why don &apos;t we ask him who he wants to be with ?
we can &apos;t ...
put him on the spot like that .
bree , you &apos;re getting all red .
is that a hot flash or you just losing your nerve ?
i was gonna finish up with those sconces .
everything okay here ?
not exactly .
can we ask you something ?
if you had to choose between ...
forest green or brown
for the trim , which would you prefer ?
forest green ... i guess .
great . then why don &apos;t you , uh , run down to the hardware store
and have them mix you up a batch ?
scoot .
what &apos;s the matter , bree ? afraid you &apos;ll lose ?
you know what ?
i think i am .
he &apos;s all yours .
well , that &apos;s not any fun . i thought you liked him .
i do but i don &apos;t get his references .
i can &apos;t stay up late like he does .
i &apos;m being silly .
i feel like one of those cliche people make fun of
the desperate , predatory divorcee .
you mean like me ?
well , yeah .
do you know why people make fun of us ?
they &apos;re jealous ,
because we still have the guts to go after what we want .
you think he can make you happy ?
i think so .
then go for it .
my gift to you .
why are you being so nice to me ?
based on my dinner under the rainbow last night ,
i &apos;d rather have you as a friend than an enemy .
now go .
keith , hang on ! i think i &apos;ll join you !
uh , really nice of you to have us over .
maybe next time you can come to our house .
absolutely .
you know , i think it &apos;s great
that out of this unfortunate situation ,
we could all end up being friends .
yes . we &apos;re very lucky people .
bet you can &apos;t catch me ! bet you can &apos;t catch me !
so now we pinch off a small piece of masa ,
and you roll it into a ball .
is this big enough ?
it &apos;s perfect . ay .
i really love your house mrs. solis .
oh , well , thank you , honey .
would you like a tour ?
uh @-@ huh .
come on .
wow . it &apos;s so big .
you have a tv in your bedroom ?
lucky .
yes , we are very lucky .
is that a jewelry box ?
you want to take a look ?
yeah .
it &apos;s all so pretty .
i can &apos;t wait till i grow up
so i can have beautiful things .
you like that ?
it &apos;s a gift i bought myself with my first big modeling check .
i want you to have it . you deserve beautiful things .
i don &apos;t know . my mom might get mad .
then we &apos;ll make it ... our little secret .
thank you .
i want a purse like that someday .
well , then i &apos;m gonna make sure you get it .
it &apos;s called a purse ,
and as every woman knows ,
it can hold just about anything ...
from a bottle for a baby ...
to a check for protection ...
to a gift for a new friend .
whatever you find inside ,
there &apos;s one thing you can be sure of ...
every purse says something about the woman who owns it ...
