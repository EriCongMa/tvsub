come on . why aren &apos;t they transferring to me ?
i look just like you .
maybe i don &apos;t have the scent right .
a few weeks ago , i found a nest of duck eggs .
i , uh ... i lovingly nursed them ,
and then , uh , by some ... sick fluke ,
claire was the only one there when the ducks were born ,
so they imprinted on her .
oh , i didn &apos;t do it on purpose .
then make them come back to me .
who &apos;s calling at this hour ?
hello ?
yes ?
luke &apos;s been arrested !
well , good morning , leonard .
leonar--
i know it &apos;s not my well @-@ behaved son , luke ,
who &apos;d never take our car out without a license
and get arrested .
i took the car for a good reason .
sarah fisher &apos;s cat died , and she was devastated ,
so i thought she might make out with me .
i got caught two blocks away from her house .
everyone is having great luck with girls except for me .
and i mean everyone .
when is a tuba @-@ strap rash not a tuba @-@ strap rash ?
when it &apos;s hickeys .
you know , we &apos;re gonna have to ground you ,
oh , we &apos;re doing way more than that .
landon has a $ 300 fine to work off .
we could fight that -- say the cop was racist .
even if we lose , it &apos;ll start a conversation .
you made a mistake , you pay the consequences , levon .
your first job is cleaning out
the awesome village i built for my ducks .
aren &apos;t they mom &apos;s ducks ?
do you really want to test me right now ? !
well , you , sir , take your time deciding .
we &apos;ll be here just as sure as a coonhound
takes a summer nap in the shade of a chifferobe .
okay , now you &apos;re just randomly throwing words together
from &quot; to kill a mockingbird . &quot;
it was a boon year for tomatoes on the farm ,
or what we &apos;re calling ...
tomatogeddon .
so they made an extra @-@ large batch of tucker &apos;s famous ,
and we &apos;re selling it at the farmers &apos; market .
now , when you say &quot; famous &quot; --
it &apos;s known missouri @-@ wide .
a death @-@ row inmate requested it for his last meal .
well , at least i &apos;m trying to sell .
what is going on ?
after buying whatever they &apos;re selling ,
i &apos;m guessing people are plum out of spending money .
wait . no .
it &apos;s andrew and simon .
thank you .
hello .
oh , hello !
here to try our hand @-@ caught artisanal trout jerky ?
no .
it &apos;s selling like hotcakes .
actually , better .
see the vegan hotcakes stand ?
next to the bespoke honey stall .
we should be careful . this market might be a trick
to get a whole bunch of white people together in one spot .
i &apos;m actually glad you &apos;re here .
we &apos;re looking for a new senior associate ,
and i was gonna call you .
call me what ? a has @-@ been ?
&quot; mitch ado about nothing &quot; ?
why am i doing your work for you ?
look , on a social level , i find you hopeless ,
but i always thought you were a good lawyer --
maybe a great one at the right firm .
honey , did you bring the other cash box ?
this one &apos;s filled up .
think about it .
come on , joe !
i don &apos;t want to learn !
but you have to learn !
and it &apos;s so easy .
look , first , you make the little man ,
then you tie the rope around its throat --
no !
joe , don &apos;t worry about tying your shoes .
that &apos;s for big boys .
don &apos;t tell him he can &apos;t .
he can &apos;t , but he &apos;ll be fine --
kid has thick , beautiful hair .
can i get back to work now ?
you &apos;re working ?
but it &apos;s not between 10 : 00 and 2 : 00,
monday through thursday .
well , i wasn &apos;t gonna tell you guys ,
&apos;cause i knew you &apos;d make a big fuss ,
but the chamber of commerce is giving me
a titans of industry award .
they asked me to make a video for the ceremony
about what drives me .
after 30 years
and over a hundred thousand hanger rods installed ,
some people would kick back and relax .
not me . i &apos;m jay pritchett .
pritchett &apos;s closets .
slow down !
how many closets do you need ?
yeah . i can handle that .
it &apos;s great .
i &apos;m starting over .
why ?
you guys were bored ,
and the video obviously doesn &apos;t capture my essence .
you think that fellow titan ed fisk , the lion of linoleum ,
would make that mistake ?
how big is this event ?
is there going to be a red carpet ?
no , but red murtaugh , of red &apos;s carpets , will be there .
i &apos;m walking with giants , gloria ,
and that &apos;s a good way to get stepped on .
oh , there are two over there .
oh , good . for a second , i didn &apos;t think we were gonna find ...
hey , isn &apos;t that beth and andy ?
um , actually , uh , those two are better .
but all those people would be between us .
yeah , but , you know , we spent all day together .
i just -- - hey . hey , you two .
he y , andy . very cool you &apos;re not fat anymore .
hi ! nice to see you guys !
we really should go find seats before the m--
sit down , please .
ever since andy got engaged ,
things between us have been weird .
like &quot; a woman with olive skin
trying to pull off red hair &quot; weird .
i just wanted to watch the movie
and get out of there before it got awkward .
i still think about you .
me too . but i &apos;m with someone else now .
i made a commitment .
but do you really love her ?
zombie !
got it !
anyway , we should have told each other how we felt .
nothing ? really ?
i could not get out of there fast enough .
what &apos;s the rush ?
sometimes they put a funny skit thing after all the names .
guys , wait up .
you want to go grab a burger and a beer next door ?
well , i -- i definitely do .
that movie brought up so much for me .
plus , i got to take my pill with food .
yeah , i &apos;m not so sure -- - you &apos;re coming .
maybe if you &apos;re there ,
he won &apos;t try and do his adorable british character
for the hostess .
will you put this in my veggie burger
and not tell me where it is ?
hey , lloyd , it &apos;s your dad , a.k.a. your worst nightmare .
just reminding you the duck village
needs to be clean enough to eat off of .
you hear me ? you better not have .
you &apos;re not allowed to use your phone .
yep , i &apos;m everywhere .
you think maybe you &apos;re being a bit hard on luke ?
we &apos;re his parents , claire .
it &apos;s our job to keep him off the stripper pole .
i actually like that he &apos;s being a little bit rebellious .
sometimes , between the magic and the trampolining ,
i think he &apos;s getting a little ... you know .
what are you trying to say , claire ?
a little ... me ?
there it was again ,
the insinuation that i &apos;m not dangerous enough for her .
apparently , she &apos;s forgotten i &apos;ve been to jail .
i once led 20 violent inmates in a therapeutic tumbling class .
it was a huge success .
could i have made the participation trophies
a little less stabby ?
sure .
but overall , a huge success .
when you say you &apos;re happy about luke being a rebel ...
are you wearing my perfume ?
it was to trick the ducks .
but like i was saying --
hey , is that alex ?
it is . that &apos;s weird .
she said she was gonna be at school all weekend studying .
hello ?
hey , honey .
i &apos;m here , too . how are you doing , honey ?
oh , yeah , i &apos;m good . i &apos;m doing some work . really busy .
well , that &apos;s interesting , be--
yeah , we &apos;ve got a boring day ahead of us , too .
heading down to the impound lot to pick up the car
because , yes , your brother got arrested last night .
oh ! okay . well , that &apos;s great .
yeah , i really got to go . i left my stuff in the library .
and i &apos;m really worried someone &apos;s gonna steal my snacks .
okay , bye !
why did you stop me ? i was gonna bust her .
what ? in a little lie ? i mean , come on .
she &apos;s probably visiting a friend
and she didn &apos;t want to hurt our feelings .
she barely reacted when she heard that lluke got arrested .
she &apos;s obviously hiding something .
and now she &apos;s walking into that liquor store .
oh , no . oh , no . now , this is serious .
a college student is visiting a friend ,
and they &apos;re buying beer !
relax , phil .
this girl has two patents .
what she needs is two parents .
okay , my point is , it wouldn &apos;t hurt alex to loosen up .
i mean , i &apos;m worried that she &apos;s getting a little ...
there it is again .
just say it , claire --
you like our kids running wild
&apos;cause you &apos;re worried they &apos;re too much
like their namby @-@ pamby dad ,
mr. goody @-@ goody , mayor of vanillatown .
is this &apos; cause the ducks like me better ?
that is biological , and you know it .
there are videos of them online
following around a vacuum cleaner .
they &apos;re basically idiots !
oh , my god . hang on . she &apos;s getting into that van .
oh , now we &apos;re concerned !
yes , i &apos;m concerned !
that is a sketchy repair van
that is probably being driven by some middle @-@ aged pervert
with one long fingernail that she met online .
oh , my god , go ! follow them !
thank you for lending us manny &apos;s easel .
did everyone love the sauce ?
well , if by &quot; everyone &quot; you mean a thousand bees
and a pony that escaped from the riding circle , yeah .
oh , no --
is this video wills where you make us compete
in a scavenger hunt for your inheritance ?
no . it &apos;s the video for my titan award . i told you about it .
i &apos;m trying to project strength and confidence .
maybe you should lose
the garfield &quot; i hate mondays &quot; mug on the mantel .
good catch .
i &apos;ve waited my whole life to hear you say those words .
want to help me out here ?
yeah .
i needed the distraction .
i had spent enough of my day
obsessing over simon &apos;s job offer .
plus , i don &apos;t know --
seeing my big , strong dad
reach out to me in a vulnerable way ,
it was -- it was kind of touching .
the red button ! how do you not see it ? !
before you got here , i was turning it on with a broom !
now just -- forget it . let &apos;s get lunch .
if i could just -- - come with me !
okay , hold the sauce in your mouth , swirl it around --
really coat your tongue . now swallow .
right ?
much better .
okay , jay , what you &apos;re gonna want to do
is hold the sauce in your mouth , sw--
i know how eating works .
not too shabby .
thank you .
you know who else makes a mean sauce is gloria &apos;s dead aunt .
oh , there it is right there .
try some . i &apos;m telling you , it &apos;s life @-@ changing .
i don &apos;t think we really need two sauces .
and sometimes , when you have sauces from --
now you eat .
oh , my god . that is amazing .
it &apos;s a secret recipe
that has been in my family for generations .
was your sauce buried in a local time capsule
during the bicentennial ? because mine was .
my great @-@ aunt miranda was the only one that could make it ,
and because i was the oldest girl
that didn &apos;t marry a peruvian ,
the recipe passed down to me .
sauce me .
right .
ay , i don &apos;t have many things
that remind me of colombia here in the house ,
but now i do .
legend has it our sauce was so secret ,
it was only written down one place .
we grew up eating this every sunday ,
and now manny and joe will , too .
it was tattooed backwards on a lame stable boy .
you could only read it in a mirror .
mm , can i see that recipe ?
uh , uh , well , i think it &apos;s a little bit rude to read --
ay ! you bumped my hand !
you &apos;ve ruined it ! no !
no , no ! i can dry it ! i can dry it !
no , now the ink &apos;s running . cam !
no , and now you have ruined my great @-@ uncle &apos;s napkins !
it &apos;s okay , does everything at this table have meaning ?
hey , sorry i &apos;m late .
my new lady , rachel , needed help
picking a pair of shorts to make her stepdad mad .
i wonder what &apos;s more of a &quot; screw you &quot; --
you telling me that story or that the ducks now stare at me
while they slowly go to the bathroom ?
didn &apos;t you guys have three ducks ?
yeah -- one , two ...
oh , no .
dude !
no , no , no , no , no , no !
where did he go ?
hey , look , there &apos;s a duck @-@ call app we can use .
oh , crap . not her .
what happened with this one ?
well , i was seeing her for a while ,
then she pulled her shade down .
classy . get ready .
scatter !
what the hell are you doing ?
are you taking pictures of me sleeping in a bikini ?
no ! i was just trying to lure that little duckling
back into my friend &apos;s yard .
oh , my god !
it &apos;s so cute !
thank you .
you &apos;re adorable for looking after him .
hey , you know , i think i &apos;ve seen you around school before .
i &apos;m tammy .
manny .
you have got to be kidding me .
what drives jay pritchett ?
a desire never to repeat himself .
let me do that again .
what drives jay pritchett ? an audi .
i &apos;m gonna start with a joke ? i &apos;m following red murtaugh .
the man &apos;s hilarious .
you &apos;ve seen him be that baby in his ads .
just so you know ,
the camera only has 11 hours of battery , so ...
let &apos;s see what we &apos;ve got .
yep .
why do i look so pale and sweaty ?
oh , well , you &apos;re old and irish .
gloria , again , i just want to say that i &apos;m--
you &apos;re sorry ? you told me .
yes , and , uh -- excuse me -- that it was an accident .
was it ?
yes , of course .
i think . i -- i don &apos;t know .
you have destroyed my children &apos;s connection to their past ,
and you might have done it on purpose ?
i &apos;m sorry .
andrew humiliated me today at the farmers &apos; market ,
and i &apos;ve always been sauce @-@ competitive ...
look , just let me help you re @-@ create it .
i saw my aunt make it once when i was 8 years old .
you think i &apos;m going to remember--
cilantro !
what ?
that car backfiring , it sounded like gunshots .
i remember when i was a little girl in my aunt &apos;s kitchen ,
and she started chopping the cilantro really loud
so that we couldn &apos;t hear the noise .
yes , okay . well , what else do you remember ?
well , nothing , cam . it was 30 years ago .
no , the recipe is inside you ! it just needs to come out !
mommy , i found it .
lemon juice !
what ?
oh , see ? i told you it &apos;s just a matter of time !
capers , jalapeno ,
and a dash of black pepper !
it &apos;s just so sad .
the guy decides to spend the rest of his life
with some zombie he doesn &apos;t love .
your table is ready .
smashing ! a bucket of chips--
we &apos;re not doing that .
okay .
hey , um , real quick--
why wasn &apos;t it more uncomfortable
for you to watch that movie ?
right . because zombies killed my parents .
oh , never mind .
i forgot you can &apos;t have an adult conversation .
no , okay , yes .
if -- if we would have watched that movie a few months ago ,
it would have been really weird , but ...
we &apos;re all good now , right ?
oh , yeah . no , i mean , i am good .
dylan and i picked up right where we left off .
i was just checking on you .
cause for a while there , you were getting a little , uh ...
yeah .
beth stood by me .
well , you know , as close as she could .
that &apos;s when i knew i was with the right person .
and -- and don &apos;t get me wrong --
i was -- i was pretty hung up on you .
but once i got it down to only one woman in my head ,
i saw beth in a whole new way ,
and we were able to move forward .
that makes sense .
i &apos;m happy for you .
look at us , brother and sister ,
separated from our mum ...
oh , you &apos;re so good at that .
hey , what do you think about
inviting haley and dylan to the wedding ?
i love that idea .
and i love you for having it .
why do you think people stopped saying &quot; coinkydink &quot; ?
dylan , um ...
oh , god .
you &apos;re breaking up with me again , aren &apos;t you ?
i &apos;m sorry . i just -- i --
i feel like andy and beth
and everyone in the world are moving forward ,
and we &apos;re moving backward .
actually , we &apos;re stopping ,
because i want to get out of the car .
dylan--
stop !
i &apos;m tired of being jerked around .
now i &apos;m moving forward , too .
can &apos;t you at least call an uber ?
you know they banned me for talking too much to the drivers !
she &apos;s still not answering . i can &apos;t believe we lost them .
we &apos;re almost home . i can track her phone from the computer .
&quot; i hope you can track her phone
better than you tracked that van . &quot;
i &apos;m sorry , claire . just because i &apos;m 1 / 64th cherokee ,
it doesn &apos;t make me a natural tracker .
you realize i &apos;m not participating in this .
well , you made it pretty clear it was my fault we lost them
due to my less @-@ than @-@ manly driving .
oh , my god .
yes , this again .
i &apos;m not letting it go till you admit that you wish i was a --
phil , it &apos;s the van !
in my own house ? !
oh , no !
okay , now , hang on .
don &apos;t hold me back , claire !
i may be one 1 / 64th cherokee ,
but i &apos;m also 63 / 64ths crazy white guy !
where is he ? !
are you okay ?
what are you talking about ?
are you okay ?
i @-@ i @-@ i &apos;m fine .
no , i &apos;m sorry ! i @-@ i -- - you are now !
reuben ?
oh , my god ! i killed reuben !
oh , babe ?
what &apos;s going on ? that &apos;s blood .
in my defense , i didn &apos;t think anyone would ever find out .
stay with me , reuben !
okay , so reuben is the one who picked you up in the van ?
yes , it was his dad &apos;s -- oh , my god !
have you been following me ?
he &apos;s coming to . he &apos;s gonna be fine .
no ! no !
don &apos;t try and make this our fault .
you are the one who went to the liquor store
and bought - what ?
ice .
reuben sprained his hamstring today while playing quidditch .
honey , don &apos;t take this the wrong way , but reuben ?
we &apos;re in love .
oh , shut up .
no , no , no , keep talking !
remember what happened when you tripped and fell
right before we got here ?
you know what ? caltech is hard .
between all the geniuses and breaking up with sanjay ,
i just wanted something comfortable ,
even if it is a wormy little dork that worships me .
oh , honey , i understand .
oh , like mother , like daughter , i guess .
okay . he &apos;s gonna be fine .
phil , come over here and talk to me for a second .
well , i guess we &apos;re done with my thing already .
if i was ever stupid enough to imply , for one second ,
that you were not bad boy enough for me ,
i couldn &apos;t possibly think that right now .
because i attacked a 16 @-@ year @-@ old ?
you didn &apos;t know who was in that closet .
that &apos;s true .
look , he &apos;s up .
okay , we &apos;re gonna leave the two of you alone .
oh , wait , wait , wait , no , no , no .
yeah , we &apos;re not gonna tell anyone about this , right ?
forbidden love . it &apos;s -- it &apos;s hotter that way .
also , i -- i had a @-@ a @-@ a wand .
i hate myself so much .
it &apos;s good .
of course it &apos;s good . it &apos;s -- i &apos;m sure -- o ... kay .
oh , my gosh . it &apos;s glorious .
so much better than mine .
well , your sauce is -- - is garbage !
it &apos;s mostly ketchup .
gloria , this is what we need to be selling
at the farmers &apos; market .
we would have them lined up clear down
past the cruelty @-@ free beaver @-@ milk stand .
i would crush andrew .
i cannot go back to the farmers &apos; market .
the year was 2011 .
i had just come back from colombia
with a box full of our family &apos;s homemade hair relaxer ,
the colombian comb @-@ out .
friday , i sold 50 bottles , but saturday ...
it says on the bottle to leave it in for three minutes !
no , it says , &quot; leave in for three .
minutes later , you will look fantastic . &quot;
one , two , three , comb it out .
ay , i see how it can be confusing .
if it &apos;s true , as many people theorize ,
that stonehenge was , in fact , a druid closet --
mitchell .
oh , yeah . oh , good . we -- we got it !
what &apos;s with you ?
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m sorry . i got this whole work thing stressing me out .
it &apos;s your lucky day .
you have an audience with a titan of industry
without having to buy the $ 15 @-@ a @-@ plate dinner ticket .
what &apos;s the issue ?
well , i got this job offer
at this really big firm , but , um ...
i &apos;ve actually , uh , been thinking about
maybe starting my own practice .
what &apos;s your gut tell you ?
i don &apos;t know .
i @-@ i would like to have my own firm , but that &apos;s really scary .
but this other offer is very attractive ,
but i &apos;d have to report to this guy who i hate ,
which , you know , might be worth it for the job security --
take the offer .
really ?
it takes a certain type of personality
to run your own thing .
you have to be a fighter .
well , this is fun .
you wanted my honest opinion .
no , cam ! i said no .
the polar ice caps are melting , gridlock in washington --
america needs to feel good again , gloria .
let them taste your sauce .
what &apos;s happening now ?
he wants me to sell my sauce at the farmers &apos; market ,
but i am not interested .
i agree with gloria .
thank you so much .
yeah , you crashed and burned with the hair thing .
you need more of that humiliation ?
we don &apos;t know that that would happen .
disappearing middle @-@ class , racial unrest ...
you got a nice thing going here , gloria . enjoy it .
what ? you don &apos;t think that i can do it ?
no . no , he doesn &apos;t .
he thinks that he &apos;s the only business titan in this family .
nobody can tell me what i can or cannot do .
i have some sauce to sell .
and i &apos;m gonna go register my new firm right now .
and i &apos;m gonna storm out , too ,
even though both of those things actually make me very happy .
you want to know what drove jay pritchett ?
people telling me i wasn &apos;t good enough .
there &apos;s something about a person telling you
you can &apos;t do something .
blood .
it just lights the competitive fires ...
drives us to take risks ...
opens us up to new opportunities ...
oh , hey , sarah .
i &apos;m sorry about your cat .
i heard you got arrested .
everything i did , i did to prove the naysayers wrong .
so , to everyone who didn &apos;t think i was good enough --
look , daddy ! i tied my shoes !
good job , joe !
how do you like me now ?
honey , i don &apos;t want to go this titans dinner any more than you do ,
but we &apos;re gonna be late .
phil .
phil . phil !
dunphy .
what is going on ?
i &apos;m trying to pay luke &apos;s impound fee ,
but this automated phone system
doesn &apos;t understand anything i &apos;m saying .
dun @-@ phy .
&quot; dun @-@ fee . &quot; yes .
no ! no !
not bill dunphy .
we went over my first name for 20 minutes !
phil !
phil !
phil !
phil !
phil !
