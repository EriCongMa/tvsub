&quot; peinture . &quot;

i don &apos;t know .
sam &apos;s little accent is amazing , isn &apos;t it ?
i wish he could hold onto it ,
but he &apos;ll probably lose it once we get him into school .
which is why it &apos;s so important
for us to always remind him of that .
french and creole is part of samuel &apos;s foundation ,
and i want to honor it .
so can we come back every year ?
yes .
i love you , mrs. wagner .

about the dragon .
about the dragon , about the dragon .
all right , where did i leave off ?
he was alone in the forest .
and he couldn &apos;t find his family , right ?
right . he was scared .
but that is when he found another dragon ,
and they bought a little dragon house together .
and they had dragon food .
i &apos;m pretty sure you &apos;re gonna need a little more
garnet and gold in your wardrobe .
that &apos;s florida state , dad .
usc &apos;s cardinal and gold .
yeah , and it &apos;s a lot farther away .
says the man who travels the globe .
it &apos;s not like i &apos;m the first kid you &apos;ve sent to college .
that &apos;s the problem .
i know what comes next .

it &apos;s just gonna be a little quieter around here .
i &apos;m sorry i &apos;m going so far away .
your mom and i just want you to be happy .

friday night , we &apos;ll celebrate .
as long as dad doesn &apos;t have to save the world .

all right , i &apos;m gonna hit it .
see you in the morning .
it wasn &apos;t this hard with the boys .
we &apos;ve got two left before we &apos;re empty @-@ nesters .
that &apos;s unchartered territory for unit chief garrett .
it &apos;s late . this can wait till tomorrow .
no . i &apos;m almost done .
okay .
i &apos;m going to bed .
i &apos;ll be up in a minute .
jack , we need you and the rest of the irt back at base asap .
let &apos;s get everyone up to speed , monty .
as you know , the wagners woke up two hours ago
to a complete nightmare .
4 @-@ year @-@ old abby was taken from their hotel room in haiti .
that &apos;s not exactly a popular vacation spot .
for the wagners , it is .
owen and emily have done outreach programs down there
for the last decade ,
but this trip was to adopt a 2 @-@ year @-@ old named samuel .
was there a ransom note ?
nothing .
that &apos;s unusual in poverty @-@ stricken nations .
usually they want a fast payout .
unless they want something bigger than the family could provide .
yeah , like trafficking , which was rampant
among the local children since the earthquake ,
but very rare among foreign visitors .
it &apos;s rare , but it happens .
what &apos;s the window ?
eight hours .
the family went to bed after 10 : 00 .
when they woke up at 6 : 00 , she was gone .
we need to narrow that down .
well , the unsub probably waited a few hours
to guarantee that everyone was sleeping .
agreed . even the most exhausted parents
may not fall asleep right away ,
so we should look at a 12 : 00 midnight ,
1 : 00 a.m. at the earliest .
that takes us down to a five or six , which is better ,
but still gives our offender a massive head start .
and they &apos;ve vanished in a country
that &apos;s not equipped for this .
simmons , call your contacts for a search and rescue .
any hotel surveillance ?
not enough . they &apos;ve only got five cameras .
we need a map of the property .
sending now .
how long have the wagners been in haiti ?
uh , 12 days .
that &apos;s long enough to establish patterns
and put them on our unsub &apos;s radar .
yeah , and a young , healthy american family &apos;s gonna
stick out there .
we &apos;ll head directly to the wagners
and meet the local officer .
we need to get as much information as possible
before the media gets ahold of this .
yeah , a beautiful american child missing ?
the media &apos;s gonna have a field day with that .
the wagners were in haiti to make a difference .
we &apos;re not about to let this end in tragedy .
第一季 第十三集
&quot; beyond the mountains ,
more mountains . &quot;
haitian proverb .
welcome .
inspector general brasier .
unit chief jack garrett .
this is my team .
great . thank you all for coming so fast .
the wagners are inside .
wait . did they make those ?
yes .
they haven &apos;t wasted much time since she &apos;s been gone .
they keep mentioning a case about a madeline ?
madeline mccann was almost her age
when she was abducted in portugal .
when was this ?
2007 .
and what happened to her ?
no one knows . she was never found .
the question , then , again
is why risk taking a child
that stands out ?
well , haitians taking haitian children
happens out in the open .
bad men go to rural villages
and sometimes convince the parents
to send their children to school ,
but those parents never see their children again .
yeah . they , uh -- they &apos;re called &quot; paper orphans . &quot;
it &apos;s happening in nepal , as well .
documents are forged saying that
they have no living relatives .
sometimes they &apos;re even adopted by unknowing families .
then maybe they &apos;re trying to send the wagners a message
because they were here to adopt .
that seems like a huge risk for a personal vendetta .
abby was taken from her room .
do you think it &apos;s somebody who works at the hotel ?
do you have any suspects ?
no comment .
the wagners made these flyers ,
but they haven &apos;t talked to us .
no comment .
you think they have something to hide ?
are you the fbi &apos;s irt ?
the press have been at it all morning .
they &apos;re vultures .
we &apos;ll handle them .
my name &apos;s jack garrett , and this is my team --
agents seger , jarvis , and simmons .
owen wagner .
um , emily and grace .
when was this photo taken ?
yesterday .
we passed them out to everyone .
we couldn &apos;t just sit still .
i understand . no one can .
we tasked people while we were in flight .
we &apos;ve had all vehicles searched
in and out of port @-@ au @-@ prince for the past two hours .
we &apos;ll continue that until our investigation
gives us more specifics .
general , i need all the security footage
from the hotel and city .
ah , the earthquake took out all the traffic cameras ,
but the hotel has their footage pulled up .
i &apos;ll want eyes on that , too .
where are we with employee interviews
and background checks ?
ah , no one is standing out .
i can &apos;t believe that abby &apos;s gone ,
and -- and no one saw anything ?
it has to be someone who works here .
we don &apos;t want to jump to any conclusions ,
but i can assure you
we &apos;ll leave no stone unturned .
agent simmons has search and rescue here to assist him .
i &apos;m , uh -- i &apos;m gonna need something of abby &apos;s
for the search team .
her , um , blanket and stuffed elephant must be with her
because we can &apos;t find them in the room .
what about what she was wearing yesterday ?
uh , her sweatshirt . i &apos;ll get it .
i &apos;ll go with you .
when these kinds of things happen to other people ...
... kids usually aren &apos;t found .
you know , just when i can &apos;t imagine a bigger nightmare ,
i start worrying about ... child trafficking .
and if abby was taken by somebody like that ,
then she could be hundreds of miles away right now .
agent simmons , i &apos;d like to join you .
you know , actually , uh , i was hoping
that you could help me retrace your family &apos;s steps
from the orphanage to the hotel last night .
okay . i can do that .
great . let &apos;s go this way .
we &apos;ll avoid the madness .
he &apos;s right , isn &apos;t he ?
this feels like an organized abduction .
she loves this one .
thank you .
lamp is &quot; lumière , &quot;
and book is &quot; livre . &quot;
you are doing so good .
merci .
when is abby gonna come back ?
well , we are here to help find her .
why would somebody take her ?
she doesn &apos;t belong to them .
mama , you need a hug ?
ooh , that &apos;s a good squeeze .
thank you .
can i watch something ?
yeah .
it &apos;s all my fault .
no .
i lost my key .
someone must have used it to get in here .
it &apos;s the only way .
i can &apos;t find my key .
we haven &apos;t determined that yet .
the room is still being processed .
i always wake up ...
ever since grace was born .
i think it &apos;s instinctual . i wake up at least once a night .
but last night , i slept through ,
and now my baby &apos;s gone .
this is not your fault , okay ?
it &apos;s not .
i keep wondering , &quot; why didn &apos;t abby wake up or cry ? &quot;
it &apos;s because i gave her the medicine for her allergies
and she was just sound asleep .
what did you give her ?
it was right here .
did they take it with them ?
wh @-@ wh @-@ why would they do that ?
well , it could be to look after her .
and if she &apos;s asleep , then she &apos;s not scared ,
right ?
mom ?
i need some help .
yeah . yeah .
oh . so , here we go .
i have children .
this is my biggest nightmare .
the answers are here . we just haven &apos;t found them yet .
well , we checked .
there &apos;s no unlocked windows ,
loose vents , or forced entry .
there &apos;s also no extra security .
emily said that she lost her key .
if it was stolen , then that means that the offender
was close enough to the family to access emily &apos;s bag .
the door beeps when it &apos;s unlocked .
don &apos;t you think that would be too loud in the middle of the night ?
yeah .
so , what if someone came in
while the family was still at the orphanage ?
they would have laid in wait for hours until everyone fell asleep .
i mean , it &apos;s extreme ,
but so is taking abby .
where would they hide ?
no one could fit under here .
they could in here .
that takes a lot of patience .
yeah , and it &apos;s bold .
what if the wagners had opened the closet ?
i want your officers to focus on prints in here .
then emily and i met here back in 2004 .
we were both part of an aid program
after hurricane jeanne hit .
and that &apos;s when we fell in love with the country ,
the ... hey .
ah . bon soir .
the culture , the strength of the people .
well , it &apos;s the second nation to america
to gain their independence .
right .
we always knew that we wanted to expand our family ,
but for years out @-@ of @-@ country adoptions were illegal here .
but after the 2010 quake ,
there were so many orphaned children ,
they really didn &apos;t have a choice .
you know , it &apos;s a beautiful thing , what your family &apos;s doing .
papa ! papa ! papa ! papa !
samuel !
i heard about abby . this is awful .
um , i need a complete list of all
employees and volunteers , past and present ,
anybody who had access to the family .
general brasier called ahead .
i &apos;ve already got it for you .
oh , thank you .
and just to confirm --
samuel had no living relatives ,
no aunts , uncles , siblings ,
anybody who &apos;d want to punish the wagners for adopting him ?
samuel is not a paper orphan .
i knew his parents ,
and sadly they died of cholera a year ago .
he was the only one spared .
leila , leila !
pardon .
merci .
there are no cameras near the wagners &apos; room ,
but i &apos;m piecing together what i can .
is anything standing out ?
not yet .
doesn &apos;t look like they &apos;re wearing a uniform .
employees have all been cleared ...
so this could be an outside vendor .
oh , my god .
that has to be abby .
what &apos;s up , jack ?
the unsub left the hotel grounds with abby at 1 : 49 a.m.
they were on foot .
calculate how far they could have gotten by now .
on it .
and since all the employees checked out ,
we need to broaden our search to every independent vendor
who would have known this property .
uh , compiling a list now . i &apos;ll hit you guys back .
clara .
we got a lead .
hey , i was just gonna call you .
what have you got ?
we picked up the trail outside the hotel .
the dogs led us about two miles north of the city .
it &apos;s a gang @-@ infested area .
it could have been used as a meeting point
if we &apos;re still talking about trafficking .
according to the surveillance video ,
they snuck her out of the hotel .
what &apos;s going on ?
hold on .
clear ! clear !
fbi !
hey . get them back .
hey , jack .
found abby &apos;s stuffed elephant .
she was here , but she &apos;s gone .
and , jack ...
we &apos;ve got blood .
not human blood .
that &apos;s a relief , but there &apos;s a lot of it .
we need to find the source .
the dogs are searching the area .
these unsubs have a million places to hide .
why would they stop just two miles from the abduction zone ?
what &apos;s in this area ?
it &apos;s run by gangs who deal in drugs and guns ,
not children .
this is beginning to feel a lot less organized than we thought .
leaving the toy behind ,
stopping so close to the abduction site
doesn &apos;t add up to someone who &apos;s done this before .
exactly . it wasn &apos;t well @-@ planned .
they just disappeared on foot
and needed to rest before walking off again .
but why this particular place and not another shelter ?
the offender &apos;s telling us a lot .
first they waited in a closet
and then calmly walked abby off the property .
there &apos;s patience , despite the risk .
when abby &apos;s arm slipped out of the linens ,
it didn &apos;t even faze the offender .
they just tucked her back in ... lovingly , even .
well , they brought along abby &apos;s medicine , blanket ,
stuffed animal , almost like they were comforting her .
the unsub could be a mother .
predisposed female .
that &apos;s never good .
abby and this place must hold some sort of ...
emotional significance .
a pauper &apos;s grave .
this dirt hasn &apos;t been disturbed .
there &apos;s no way abby &apos;s in there .
that &apos;s her blanket .
it &apos;s unmarked .
this area has seen flooding and much disease .
could be anyone .
well , whoever &apos;s in there may be connected to our unsub .
we need to identify the remains .
i &apos;m sorry . we cannot do that .
burying the dead is a sacred act .
i understand completely ,
but we need to process this scene ,
and looking in this grave is step one .
i &apos;ll make a call , but this is not going to be easy .
hey , guys , i got the source of the blood from the shack .
this looks like a religious ritual .
a friend of mine is a healer
who may be able to help determine which ritual it is .
mae , send your photos to clara .
done .
and can you please have your friend meet us back at the hotel ?
yes . of course .
mae , you stay here until we can find out who &apos;s in this grave .
i &apos;m not sure how long that &apos;s gonna take .
we &apos;re nearly 12 hours into abby &apos;s abduction .
we got to move on this .
now that we know this is an emotionally driven unsub ,
chances are she feels a bond with abby .
which means the wagners have seen her .
they just didn &apos;t know it .
our viewers would like to know how to help ,
but avoiding the media has made everyone suspicious .
we &apos;re busy looking for abby .
is it true you drugged your daughter before bed ,
making her more susceptible to the abduction ?
she has allergies .
wait . who told you that ?
we had to do our own investigating
since the authorities locked us out of the process .
we heard your wife gave her the medicine .
do you think she gave her too much ?
hey , hey . no more questions .
this is unit chief jack garrett
with the fbi &apos;s international response team .
agent , do you have any leads ?
i said no more .
have you questioned owen and emily wagner ?
a @-@ are they considered suspects ?
they had nothing to do with their daughter &apos;s disappearance .
some polls beg to differ .
people think the mother should be charged
with negligence at the very least .
that &apos;s enough .
drugging her daughter .
turn off your camera .
turn it off !
now , you listen to me .
while you &apos;re out here
picking apart the parents of a missing child --
it &apos;s my job .
i said listen !
this family is in the middle of the worst thing
that &apos;s ever happened to them .
you need to seriously reconsider your reporting
and find some humanity .
let &apos;s go .
how &apos;s she holding up ?
she &apos;s still standing .
you think she &apos;s up for a cognitive ?
i don &apos;t know .
did you get the photos from mae ?
yes , but it doesn &apos;t look like any ritual i &apos;ve ever seen .
hopefully the healer will have some insight .
his name &apos;s jean @-@ paul , and he &apos;s on his way .
jean @-@ paul ?
not what you were expecting for a witch doctor , eh ?
we &apos;re nothing to be afraid of .
oh . i appreciate you meeting me .
of course .
i &apos;m so sorry this little girl was taken .
i saw the flyers all over the city .
do you know why anyone would take her to this grave ?
who is buried in here ?
that &apos;s what we &apos;re trying to figure out .
pauper &apos;s graves such as this is a desecration in haitian culture .
so would that be why there &apos;s an animal sacrifice there ?
a living child and sacrificial animal
feels like conflicting ceremonies .
whoever has taken her is confused ,
which makes them incredibly dangerous .
however , there is an ancient ritual
one year and a day after the death of a loved one .
it &apos;s to reclaim the spirit from ancestral waters
and to elevate the spirit of the dead
to a new spiritual evolution .
so this person thinks they can transfer
a dead spirit into a new body .
yes , but the ritual itself is dangerous .
it requires the host body to be wrapped in linen
before soaking them in water .
done in the wrong hands , it &apos;s led to drowning .
it sounds like waterboarding .
i would never suggest practicing this with such a young person .
so , um , how much time do we have
before abby &apos;s physically endangered ?
she was taken before sunrise ,
so this will be over before the next one .
it &apos;s impossible that someone connected with abby .
i would have noticed .
not necessarily .
you never knew to look for anyone .
and now , during times of stress ,
details often get buried .
there &apos;s a way that we can dig them out .
i &apos;ll do anything to help .
good .
have a seat .
i &apos;m gonna walk you through yesterday morning ,
but first you need to block out any stimuli ,
so ... just close your eyes .
just relax .
did you wake up early ?
yes .
and ... everyone was hungry ,
so we went downstairs for breakfast .
was it crowded ?
no .
it &apos;s a simple setup . we serve ourselves .
then where did you go ?
we walked to the orphanage .
but the girls wanted to play ,
so we stopped for a few minutes , and then we kept --
okay . hold on . slow down .
i need all the little details so we can fill in the blanks .
so , where &apos;d the girls play ?
in this little park near the orphanage .
were there vendors ?
what did it smell like ?
fried plantains .
okay .
how about the sounds ?
laughter .
there were some other american kids running past us .
had you seen them before ?
yeah .
abby dropped her elephant ,
and a woman handed it to her .
was she with the other children ?
she was a nanny , i think .
an american ?
no . she was haitian .
and what did abby do when the nanny handed her the elephant ?
she said , uh ...
merci !
and then abby ran over to me .
but the woman kept staring at us .
oh , god . is that her ?
it &apos;s a small gesture , but , yes ,
that could have been the connection she needed .
was that family staying at this hotel ?
i don &apos;t know .
can you describe what the nanny looked like ?
do you remember what she was wearing ?
some kind of uniform , but it wasn &apos;t from a hotel .
it was different .
she had a name tag .
what did it say ?
sara .
could be a local woman from a babysitting service .
does this help ?
yes .
monty ?
hey , jack . i got a weird overlap with the vendors .
we think the unsub works for a babysitting service .
funny , because that &apos;s the weirdness .
someone &apos;s cornered the market .
i &apos;ve got five businesses offering babysitting services ,
but they all have the same owner and address .
i &apos;m sending it to clara now .
i think it &apos;s gonna be on that corner .
monty said the owner has all of the nanny services in the city .
i &apos;m willing to bet he runs more than that
and he &apos;s got something to hide .
now , where is this place ?
come on . get up . get up .
merci .
call the authorities . let &apos;s get them out of here .
there &apos;s no sign of abby .
okay . time to talk .
why should i help you ?
well , it &apos;s men like you -- the ones who hurt children --
they never survive prison .
so , i &apos;ll tell you what -- you give me the names of all the people
who work for your little babysitting enterprise ,
and i &apos;ll see to it that you go away
for weapons and drug running -- how about that ?
because i &apos;m sure you &apos;d like to sound like a tough guy
in there as opposed to the , uh , coward you really are .
and you &apos;re the one calling me a tough guy .
why don &apos;t we start with anyone named sara ?
i know 10 different saras .
okay , listen -- we &apos;re looking for a sara
who lost a loved one about a year ago .
you think that helps you find her ?
welcome to life in haiti .
okay .
can you get a list of saras ?
i &apos;ll get the list .
good .
mae , where are you guys with the remains ?
uh , haven &apos;t seen any yet , but they &apos;re almost done digging .
okay . we got to hurry .
the healer said that abby could be undergoing some kind of ritual
that could be fatal by sunrise .
okay , well , as soon as i have any samples ,
i will rush the results ,
but we could still be looking at hours
before i know the identity of ...
agent jarvis .
... of whoever &apos;s in here . hang on .
yeah , we got a problem .
it &apos;s a mass grave .
this is gonna take a lot longer than i thought .
elsie .
elsie .
elsie .
i &apos;ve got 10 bodies here .
they &apos;re all male except one .
apparently that section of the slum
suffered from a fatal flood a year ago .
yeah , and because of the extreme poverty ,
many of them were buried at the same time .
well , the remains are all deteriorated ,
so without hours to examine each one ,
i can &apos;t determine a cause of death ,
so i &apos;ll take your word for it that they drowned .
now , the young woman is the only female ,
so i started with her and i found something interesting .
she has separation of her symphysis pubis
and laceration of the ligaments on her pubic bone .
so , whoever she was , she had recently given birth .
how old was she ?
15 , 16 tops .
well , oftentimes younger women than that are married off
and pregnant earlier than that .
this was almost discarded .
guys , hold on .
oh , my god .
i &apos;ve got the remains of a premature infant .
this may be a young woman who didn &apos;t die in a flood .
most likely it was childbirth that killed her .
okay , well , that &apos;s awful ,
but it also helps us narrow down to who that is
and how they &apos;re connected to one of these saras on the list .
thanks , mae .
monty , hey .
okay , so , i &apos;ve run the list of all babysitters named sara ,
and it turns out it &apos;s not a popular name in haiti .
however , saraphina is .
i &apos;m thinking osse had her shorten it
to sound more american .
yeah , well , we believe the saraphina we &apos;re looking for
lost a daughter during childbirth ,
and if she &apos;s partaking in the ritual ,
she believes that abby
is gonna bring back the spirit of her own child .
and she didn &apos;t take a haitian child
who could have died from a number of diseases .
she wanted a healthy american girl
who had a higher chance of survival .
right . losing her granddaughter and daughter
could be a trigger ,
but we &apos;re certain
that she &apos;s had a lifetime of stressors .
okay . i &apos;m cross @-@ referencing all churches ,
prayer lists , and death records .
now , when you say &quot; stressors , &quot;
do you think that she &apos;s lost more
than just the daughter and the infant in the grave ?
yes . look into other family losses .
all right , saraphina labeau
has lost five loved ones since 2009 .
uh , one was her husband .
the other four were her children .
the first death was a stillborn .
her husband died in an aftershock
while scavenging for metal rubble .
then the largest outbreak of cholera killed hundreds of thousands ,
including all of saraphina &apos;s children
except the oldest .
the only survivor was her daughter elsie .
i mean , she &apos;s had a lifetime of stressors ,
more than anyone should bear .
it &apos;s been years in the making ,
but she &apos;s suffering from a grief @-@ induced psychotic break ,
which makes her more unpredictable .

saraphina &apos;s in the midst of a psychotic break .
