&quot; a &quot; hacked into the van &apos;s computer system
and took remote control of the vehicle .
there &apos;s something you need to know .
v _ 海斯汀 _ 移动电话987
getting a little tired of memorializing mona .
are you saying that the world &apos;s better off without her ?
what the ..
mom !
we know about a.
this a killed my mom and mona .
you &apos;re not alison .
every night the main generator shuts down like clockwork .
it takes exactly three minutes for the backup power to kick in .
that &apos;s the way out , but you have to climb up .
there &apos;s a steel door in the hall
and it &apos;s sealed like a vault .
the blocks in the playroom spelled out a name &quot; charles . &quot;
a is recreating a prom we already had ?
what if we use the staircase
to make a grand entrance for ali ?
that &apos;s where the van is .
this is the old campbell farm .
we &apos;ve searched the entire property ,
there &apos;s no one here .
then where is this place ?
you should be standing up here , charles .
now .
&apos;let &apos;s go ! &apos;
wanna say goodnight to your sister with a little kiss ?
is that you , charles ?
spencer ?
spencer , where are you ?
hurry , let &apos;s go . let &apos;s go , let &apos;s go , let &apos;s go . go , go .
come on , guys !
come on ! let &apos;s go !
hurry !
go !
oh , my god .
we &apos;re still trapped .
we can climb it . let &apos;s go .
stop !
there &apos;s no way out .
i @-@ i &apos;m not going back down there .
you maybe a dude but you &apos;re still a bitch .
you guys , in the vault , i was so close to charles
i could feel his breath .
was there anything about him that you recognized ?
a smell ?
she &apos;s not jenna .
i don &apos;t know , i can &apos;t pinpoint it
but there was something that was really familiar .
you mean like the way he moved ?
no , it was ..
like when you meet a pen @-@ pal or like a cousin
or somebody that you knew when you were really little .
so you &apos;re saying you think you know charles a little
but you feel like you know him a lot ?
i can &apos;t explain , it was just .. it was just a feeling .
it &apos;s gonna get cold out here tonight .
where do you think we are ?
we don &apos;t ..
we don &apos;t know how long we were out before we got here , so ...
we could be in the amazon right now .
no , we are in the northern hampshire .
that &apos;s the waning moon .
i was saying that &quot; feciciously . &quot;
well , that &apos;s even not a letter of word , hanna .
oh my god .
this fence is like a giant lagging rod .
you &apos;re gonna let us fried out here ?
how long can a person live without food ?
three weeks .
but water &apos;s a different story .
some people can only go a few days without it .
you know you &apos;re dying when you &apos;re not hungry
or thirsty anymore .
it means your organs are shutting down .
mine are definitely working .
i &apos;m so thirsty , i &apos;m seriously considering drinking my own pee .
i can totally suck on a pee ice cube right now .
i &apos;d lick sweat of a jockstrap .
okay , emily , you win .
i don &apos;t know how much longer i can handle this .
you can handle it , aria .
we all can .
&apos;bonjour . good morning . buenos dias.&apos;
&apos;please enter and follow the lighted pathway.&apos;
i mean , i @-@ i &apos;m afraid to stay up here
but i &apos;m also scared to death to go back there .
&apos;please enter and follow the lighted pathway.&apos;
you &apos;ve been here the longest , mona .
what do we do ?
maybe this was our punishment .
maybe it &apos;s not mad at us anymore .
let &apos;s all stick together .
always .
what the hell ?
mona ! mona !
mona !
mona !
hanna .
is this a hospital ?
looks more like a morgue .
it feels like somebody &apos;s ripping my brain out
through my eye sockets .
what did they do to us ?
thank god .
what ?
i thought for a second a harvested our organs .
emily , we &apos;d be dead .
you only need one kidney .
hey , guys , i think a wanted to make us look dead
to send a message to our families .
what do you mean ?
so they &apos;d stop looking for us .
aspirin ? juice ?
mona , what the hell is going on ?
what happened to us ?
i &apos;ve asked not to call me that ever again , hanna .
that bitch is dead to me .
okay , ali ..
ali , do you know what a did to us ?
we &apos;re scared .
i &apos;m scared too .
how long have we been here ?
how long were we unconscious ?
only a few hours .
i &apos;ve been in my room until now . that &apos;s all i know .
are you sure that &apos;s all you know ?
please return to your rooms and find your surprises .
no .
please return to your rooms and find your surprises .
i said , &quot; no . &quot;
three chimes means we have to go to our rooms .
or else ..
ali .
ali .
ali , wait up . please , talk to us .
or else what ?
it steals you in the night
and puts you in the hole .
please return to your rooms and find your surprises .
i hate surprises .
whatever the hole is i don &apos;t wanna go there .
no , no , no ...
oh , my god !
please , no !
the four teen girls who were abducted
almost a month ago are still missing .
today , their friend , alison dilaurentis
whose murder conviction was recently overturned
is about to address the public for the first time .
police are reminding viewers to report any information
on andrew campbell &apos;s whereabouts .
the star athlete and honor roll student
remains the top suspect in the kidnapping case
and is presumed to be dangerous .
excuse me , alison , alison , one question .
one month ago my friends were kidnapped
by a faceless , nameless coward .
and the same monster who attacked mona vanderwaal
and framed us for her murder .
we now know that mona is alive .
but she is in grave danger .
as well as my friends .
i &apos;m so thankful to be home with my family .
but i would do anything to see my friends again .
my friends have always been my rock .
without them i &apos;m lost in the woods .
totally alone .
andrew , if you &apos;re listening ..
... please don &apos;t hurt them .
please .
thank you . that &apos;s all .
do you really think campbell did it ?
right now , i just need to be with my family .
alone . no questions .
and please , no more police .
this better work .
andrew &apos;s been obsessed with the girls
since ali went missing .
if he really thinks that she &apos;s here alone
there is no way he &apos;ll pass up the opportunity to grab her .
and if you &apos;re wrong ?
dad , this was my idea .
if we don &apos;t poke the bear , it &apos;ll just keep hibernating .
i know . i just ..
... don &apos;t like the idea of using my daughter as bait .
your daughter will have police protection 24 hours a day .
we will leave nothing up to chance .
and if andrew or anybody else tries to contact her
we &apos;ll be ready .
so what do we do now ?
we wait .
and we hope that andrew makes a move .
mona , is that you ?
mona . mona !
mona !
mona !
mona , come on . please help us !
mona !
mona !
do you need anything ? food , soda ?
no . i &apos;m fine .
toby , what the hell ?
why didn &apos;t you come in the front ?
told me to be discreet , i came through the garage .
everybody stay absolutely silent .
hello ?
hello ?
i know i &apos;m the one that you really want .
just tell me where you are and i &apos;ll find a way to get there .
but i have to know that you won &apos;t hurt them .
did you get it ?
the caller &apos;s in the house .
do not open this door for anyone .
you stay down here .
first floor is clear .
jason and mr. dilaurentis are with hernandez .
okay .
show me your hands .
let me see your hands .
hello .
why aren &apos;t you downstairs ?
where the hell is she ?
put out an apb .
alison and campbell should be on everyone &apos;s screensaver
from here to lake michigan .
what is it , toby ?
it &apos;s that song .
my mom used to play it on the piano .
it &apos;s called &quot; don &apos;t sit under the apple tree . &quot;
call that in .
we got a ...
stop . please . someone tell us what the hell is goin &apos; on .
that song was a message
about the campbell apple farm .
ali figured it out before we did .
and i think that she went there to meet andrew without us .
it worked . they thought the call was from a.
oh , it &apos;s toby .
&quot; tanner sent everyone to the campbell apple farm .
we &apos;re in the clear . &quot;
i don &apos;t know if i &apos;d say that .
me neither .
there &apos;s no other way .
as long as tanner &apos;s around
a won &apos;t come near me with a ten @-@ foot pole .
are you even sure that andrew even got the message
about the rock and being lost in the woods and ...
believe me , he &apos;ll be at the kissing rock .
he won &apos;t miss a chance to get his hands on me .
ali , listen ..
we &apos;re gonna be tracking you every step of the way .
and toby will always know where we are .
ali , those are for you .
nice kicks .
welcome home gift ?
actually inside is a tracking device .
it works like your phones gps system .
it transports a signal to a satellite
and bounces back to us .
so wherever andrew takes you
we &apos;ll only be a few seconds behind .
and if this works then you &apos;ll take us right to the girls .
well , you know what they say
give the girl a good pair of shoes
and she can conquer the world , right ?
please proceed to ali &apos;s room and prepare for arrival .
please proceed to ali &apos;s room and prepare for arrival .
please proceed to ali &apos;s room and prepare for arrival .
i &apos;d ask if you were okay but ..
let &apos;s not talk about what we just went through .
at least not until we get out of here .
i don &apos;t know if i could even find the words .
we &apos;re all together again .
okay , it &apos;s gonna be okay .
please proceed to ali &apos;s room and prepare for arrival .
i don &apos;t wanna get in trouble again .
let &apos;just go .
be careful .
this is all ali &apos;s stuff from her room at home .
you guys , ali &apos;s murder conviction was overturned .
迪劳伦提斯谋杀罪名被推翻
they &apos;re letting her go .
if that &apos;s even a real paper .
how did a get all this stuff ?
you &apos;re seriously still asking how ?
yeah , aria &apos;s right . question down here is why .
did a force you guys to sign the welcome card for ali ?
oh , my god .
i think we &apos;re getting ready for ali &apos;s arrival .
the real ali , not mona .
oh , ali . no .
what ? what is it spence ?
&quot; dilaurentis was offered police protection
but declined citing the need to heal
privately with her family . &quot;
so ali &apos;s a sitting duck .
if a brings ali here
does that mean that he won &apos;t need mona anymore ?
so where is she ?
charles ?
is that you ?
i &apos;m sorry i upset you .
but if you let me out , i promise i &apos;ll be a good ali .
the best you &apos;ll ever find .
just give me a chance and you &apos;ll see .
no . no , no , no , don &apos;t go .
don &apos;t go , please .
charles ? charles .
no . please , don &apos;t leave me here !
no . please , please , don &apos;t leave me !
i can &apos;t believe ali saved this .
this from the day we were at the lake .
well , ali was in rare form that day , remember ?
she insulted everyone we &apos;d ever met .
we let her call lucas , hermie .
we let her blind jenna .
we are not the same people we were back then .
including ali .
hey , spence , can you come help me with this ?
what ? help you with what ?
the rod &apos;s just a little bit loose .
i don &apos;t know . hanna , can you please do it ?
she &apos;s busy .
what ?
you see what i mean ?
oh , yeah , i see ..
... remains the top suspect of the kidnapping case
and he &apos;s presumed to be dangerous .
the four teen girls who were abducted ..
no one moves from that spot , you hear me ?
no sign of alison or andrew at the campbell farm .
if you have any idea where she could be right now
you better tell me before it &apos;s too late .
did you see that ?
look .
behind the reporter .
there . the guy in the hat .
speaking for the first time publicly ..
that could be him . that could be andrew .
can you get a plate number ?
here we go .
blue sedan with a partial plate .
1 @-@ 8 @-@ 0 . that &apos;s the best we &apos;re gonna get .
i &apos;ll call it in .
head north .
then make an immediate left turn .
she &apos;s turning onto the highway . northbound .
hey , don &apos;t get too close , okay ?
if we can see her , a can see us .
this better not be a colossal mistake .
if we loose ali ...
we &apos;re not loosing anyone .
not ali , not anyone .
i promised hanna &apos;s mom i would get the girls back .
and i don &apos;t plan on breaking that promise .
you got a box too .
a is making this house our home .
you guys , charles took our stuff
before he took us .
i thought that i lost this ages ago .
a planed on bringin &apos; us here the whole time .
to live like his dolls .
this article is about our families .
all of them .
they barely hanging on to hope .
i don &apos;t wanna hear that .
like you said that &apos;s probably not even real .
well , real or not ..
... they don &apos;t know where we are .
they don &apos;t even know if we &apos;re alive .
can you just imagine what they &apos;re going though ?
it plays in my head on a loop .
day after day , night after night .
i will kill you for what you &apos;re doing to our families !
do you hear me ?
aria , stop .
calm down .
not knowing that if we &apos;re okay
has made my mom physically sick .
they took her to the hospital .
hanna ..
hanna ..
let &apos;s just all help hanna unpack .
hanna , i &apos;m gonna help you unpack .
we &apos;re gonna find mona and we &apos;re gonna get out of here tonight .
how ?
did you guys know that , um
i won an etch a sketch contest
when i was in the third grade ?
of course , you did .
i can draw some really , really pretty pictures .
the generator still shuts down with the switch @-@ over .
i heard it too but i was too scared to leave my room .
see ?
* hush little baby don &apos;t say a word *
* mama &apos;s gonna buy you a mockingbird *
* and if that mockingbird don &apos;t sing *
* mama &apos;s gonna buy you a diamond ring *
* and if that diamond ring turns brass *
* mama &apos;s gonna buy you a looking glass *
your destination is on the right .
宾夕法尼亚州
you have reached your destination .
roadside assistance , may i help you ?
hi , my car has broken down . i need help .
what you need is in the trunk of the car .
what ? what did you say ?
i said , open the trunk of the car , alison .
she &apos;s still not moving ?
no , she &apos;s at a dead stop .
that &apos;s a poor choice of words .
slow down . we don &apos;t wanna get too close .
this doesn &apos;t feel right .
you should call toby .
we got a lead on campbell &apos;s car .
a vehicle matching that description
was reported stolen two weeks ago .
we got the rest of the plate number
and we tracked it toll road .
where ?
outside tyler state park .
okay , let &apos;s go .
where is she ?
ali &apos;s signal stopped here .
no , no , no .
&apos;put on the clothes and start walking.&apos;
&apos;leave everything else behind or they die.&apos;
which way did she go ?
hey , she put &apos; em like this for a reason .
let &apos;s go .
hanna , let &apos;s go .
one , two , three ..
four , five ..
six , seven ...
&quot; chandelier &apos;s rituals .
sister launched lair . a ruler &apos;s list chained . &quot;
they &apos;re all anagrams .
for charles dilaurentis .
some of those toys in ali &apos;s room were hers
but some of them were his .
i feel like they grew up together .
if i &apos;m right , everything that matters most
to charles is in this vault .
if we get in , we can use
what &apos;s inside to bargain our way out .
but mona said we won &apos;t make it
to the vault before the power comes on .
okay , if i &apos;m right , this is as far as we need to go .
i counted the steps to the vault from the prom room .
of course you did .
it &apos;s 84 .
and that &apos;s just one hallway over .
coming back this way , it &apos;s 81 steps .
i think the vault is on the other side of this wall .
yeah , but how does that help us ?
we can &apos;t bust through there .
charles disappeared like houdini when mona came into the room .
so there &apos;s gotta be like a secret passage way
or like a trapdoor or something .
wait , do you guys hear that ?
i think the generator is coming back on .
he knows that we &apos;re out .
just help me move it .
come on !
there &apos;s something behind this .
come on , it could be like a passageway or something .
come on !

a does have a soul .
&apos;wanna say goodnight to your sister .. &apos;
&apos;and give a little kiss ?
&apos;what a good boy you are.&apos;
oh , good boys , good boys .
game on , charles .
we want mona back !
let &apos;s torch this place .
oh , my god .

what if we &apos;re the only ones here ?
what do we do ? it &apos;s spreading too fast .
there &apos;s just no way i &apos;m dying in this hell @-@ hole .
we are not giving up .
okay , we @-@ we just need to find a blanket or something .
