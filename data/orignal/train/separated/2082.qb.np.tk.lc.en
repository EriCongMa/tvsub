please don &apos;t be mad . please .
you know what ? i knew something like this
would happen if i made you my prep cook .
well , then why &apos;d you make me your prep cook
if you knew this was gonna happen ?
you forced me to make you my prep cook .
you told me that mashing potatoes wasn &apos;t enough responsibility .
you wanted more responsibility .
and i made you my prep cook .
you &apos;re right .

aunt deb ?
come here and give me a hug .
what are you doing here ?
well , it &apos;s been years since i &apos;ve seen you ,
and i figured it &apos;s high time i paid you a visit .
you look fantastic .
well , look at you . let me see ...
what ?
what do you got ?
i see a little little gray fleck right there .
oh , yeah ,
a little bit . you like that ?
yeah , yeah , i like it .
i think it makes you look very distinguished .
thank you very much .
yeah .
the tattoos not so much .
aunt deb ?
oh ! it &apos;s mary and her little lamb .
oh , honey ! oh !
i didn &apos;t know you were coming .
did you know she was coming ?
no , i had no idea .
oh , it &apos;s so great to see you guys .
well , come on . let &apos;s sit down .
aunt deb , we &apos;d love to , but we &apos;re in
the middle of a culinary crisis right now .
we , um , screwed up the turkey .
it &apos;s still frozen .
&quot; we . &quot;
well , then i got here just in time .
mcgarrett . yeah , okay , i &apos;m on the way .
i gotta go .
what , you &apos;re leaving already ?
it &apos;s work . i gotta go .
listen , can you handle the bird , please ?
are you kidding ? we got it covered . go . go .
i want constant updates , though .
all right ?
all right , okay , go , go .
so , what are the odds of me actually eating turkey today ?
what do i got , a 10 % chance ? 20 % ?
will you relax , okay ? my aunt deb is there .
she &apos;s gonna figure everything out .
oh , your aunt deb . your father &apos;s sister .
the one who took care of mary after your mother faked her death ?
there &apos;s something seriously wrong with you , you know that ?
me ?
you like reminding me of that ?
why would you like reminding me of that ?
it &apos;s the truth .
yes , it &apos;s the truth .
yes , it &apos;s the truth .
aunt deb who raised mary all by herself .
that must have been trying .
you don &apos;t know the half of it .
she walked away from a record deal
when that kid got thrown in her lap , you know that ?
she was a singer ?
you didn &apos;t know that ?
i did not .
yeah , she struggled as a backup singer for 20 years ,
and she finally got a big break ,
but she walked away from it
as soon as mary came into the picture .
just like that , huh ? just like that , man .
she knew she couldn &apos;t raise a kid
if she was gonna be on the road half the year ,
so she quit .
she became a singing coach instead .
oh , ah , catherine .
yeah ?
what &apos;s up ?
all right , here &apos;s what we know :
so , a four @-@ man crew was out trolling for some skipjack
when they hooked this .
huh . 45 @-@ gallon barrel . that &apos;s not your usual bycatch .
let me guess . there &apos;s a @-@ a body in here .
just take a look .
all right .
oh , no .
where &apos;s the rest of him ?
help you ladies ?
yeah , we need a turkey .
you know it &apos;s thanksgiving , right ?
yeah . look , hairnet , we don &apos;t need sarcasm ,
all we need is a turkey , okay ?
please ? we &apos;re desperate .
let me check .
here , honey , come here . no @-@ no @-@ no @-@ no @-@ no @-@ no .
come on , come on , come on , come on , come on .
are you sure ?
oh , yeah . come on .
my baby .
you &apos;re like a baby whisperer .
i got my moves .
oh , yeah ? can i have some ?
what is it ?
i don &apos;t know . i just , i really feel like i &apos;m in over my head .
did you ever feel like that with me ?
always .
really ?
so i &apos;m guessing i didn &apos;t make life very easy for you .
well , let me put it this way .
you had your moments .
how &apos;d you do it , deb ?
i mean , i feel like i have no clue what i &apos;m doing .
you think i did ?
oh , honey , i @-@ i was winging it the whole time .
and it @-@ it was scary .
being a mom is the hardest job in whole wide world .
but , you know , i can &apos;t think of anybody
who &apos;s better suited for it than you .
you got a big heart .
you &apos;re smart .
all you have to do is love her with everything you got
and you &apos;re gonna be fine .
hey , sweetie .
okay , here we are .
oh , you &apos;re kidding .
that &apos;s the best you got ? the runt of the litter ?
hey , next time plan ahead .
thank you for that sage advice .
what are you saying , cuz ?
i &apos;m saying it &apos;s over .
after we got back from tokyo ,
we took down the rest of michael noshimuri &apos;s allies .
that faction &apos;s gone , kono .
they &apos;re finished .
any closer to finding adam ?
um , from what i &apos;ve been able to piece together ,
i think he may be in seattle .
so i &apos;m flying there today .
okay . it &apos;s gonna be easier for you to move around
now that you don &apos;t have to look over your shoulder .
so i guess that means
you &apos;ll be spending thanksgiving at 30,000 feet .
table &apos;s gonna feel empty without you .
i &apos;ll be there next year .
i promise .
hey , look , i should get going .
i don &apos;t want to miss my flight .
good luck .
mahalo , cuz ... for everything .
i just got off the phone with kono .
she &apos;s heading to seattle .
new lead ?
we &apos;ll see .
so where are we at ?
okay , according to fong ,
the barrel our vic was found in was filled with lye .
surprise , it &apos;s highly corrosive .
it &apos;s also cheap and easy to get .
max finish the autopsy ?
he did .
and look what he found around the vic &apos;s neck .
what is that , a medical alert id ?
says the name is kyle russo , d.o.b. : 5 @-@ 9 @-@ 78 .
kyle russo
our vic was secret service .
大威基基希尔顿度假酒店
excuse me , devon campbell .
steve mcgarrett .
catherine rollins . five @-@ o.
field office said you guys were coming . hang on a sec . sorry .
busy day .
yeah , we can see that . what &apos;s going on ?
the president &apos;s on his way to the island .
he &apos;ll be here later today .
he usually does thanksgiving in dc ,
but two nights ago he decided he wanted to come here .
doesn &apos;t leave us much prep time , but ... we &apos;ll be ready .
what can i do for you ?
we need to talk to you about one of your agents , kyle russo .
yeah , what about him ?
he was murdered yesterday .
what ?
we found his remains in a barrel
just offshore this morning .
you got any suspects ?
no , sir , we don &apos;t .
but everything is pointing to a professional hit .
when was the last time you spoke with agent russo ?
i got a text from him last night .
he said he was headed up to the north shore this morning
to check on a bookstore potus might want to visit .
what time did he send that text ?
a little after 9 : 00 . why ?
because our m.e. puts time of death someplace
5 : 00 and 7 : 00 .
that means agent russo &apos;s killer
took his phone , sent you that text so you wouldn &apos;t
be suspicious when he didn &apos;t show up
for work this morning .
right .
my god .
agent campbell . what ?
all our agents have intel on potus &apos;s trip
stored on their phone .
itinerary down to the half @-@ minute ,
path of the motorcade ,
emergency protocols .
if that intel has fallen into the wrong hands ,
then we have a threat to the president .
距到达还有六小时
as a precaution , we &apos;re changing the path of the motorcade
ascape routes .
hpd &apos;s helping us lock everything down
and swat &apos;s gonna back up our counter assault team .
thank you for coming , captain .
no problem . i got everybody on this .
希尔顿夏威夷度假村
all right .
what do you want from my team ?
plain and simple .
i need you to find the son of a bitch that killed kyle russo .
now , i don &apos;t have assets in place to run an investigation .
right now , my only concern has to be
the president &apos;s safety and security .
i have no other priorities .
all right , i need to , uh , retrace russo &apos;s steps .
what can you tell me about his activities yesterday ?
he was in kailua for most of it .
potus stays at
a private home out there when he &apos;s in town .
russo was looking into some of the residents
to see if any of &apos; em posed a threat .
he check in with you ?
he said there was one guy
he wanted to run some background on ,
maybe ... maybe talk to again .
he give you a name ?
keith nolan . that &apos;s all he gave me .
apparently , this guy &apos;s renting a house out there
less than a quarter of a mile from the one potus is staying in .
russo said it was probably nothing .
when i got that text last night ,
i just assumed the guy checked out .
yeah , maybe he did .
but if russo considered him a potential threat ,
he &apos;s somebody we want to talk to .
all right .
凯斯 · 诺兰租住处
mr. nolan ?
steve mcgarrett , five @-@ o.
can we talk to you ?
boiling water on the stove .
the guy , uh , took off in a hurry .
that is a big bullet .
this is a nato 7.62 sniper round .
it &apos;s accurate up to 1,000 meters .
so maybe russo was onto something .
hey ! five @-@ o !
let me see your hands , right now . who are you ?
i &apos;m sheila hicks .
i live up the street .
i look after the house for the owner .
can i put my hands down now , please ?
of course you can . i &apos;m sorry .
uh ... you , uh ,
you happen to get a look at the guy
that &apos;s been staying here ?
mr. nolan ?
yeah , he got in yesterday morning .
he &apos;s from maui .
he &apos;s a very friendly guy .
oh , it &apos;s just my daughter !
come here , sweetie .
mom , what &apos;s going on ?
it &apos;s okay .
these men are five @-@ o.
we just have some questions
about the man who &apos;s renting this house .
can you tell us what he looked like ?
sure . he &apos;s 40s .
six feet .
black hair . oh , and you know what ?
and he had a tattoo on the back of his neck .
how &apos; bout this guy ?
you , uh ... you seen him ?
yes .
i saw him and mr.nolan talking outside yesterday .
what time was that ?
little after 4 : 00 ?
you know , he didn &apos;t stay very long .
maybe three , four minutes .
and then he left ,
and mr. nolan took off right after that .
but i @-@ i haven &apos;t seen either of them since .
okay , how &apos; bout you ?
you see anything ?
i just got in an hour ago .
she flew in for the holiday .
my andrea &apos;s been traveling for the last few months
but she wanted to spend thanksgiving with her mom .
oh , that &apos;s nice .
that &apos;s nice . uh ... here &apos;s your keys .
thank you .
sorry about the scare ,
and thanks for your help .
you need anything , i &apos;m right next door .
nosy neighbor is a cop &apos;s best friend , right ?
right .
all right , thank you .
all right , so maui pd has no record
of anyone named keith nolan
that matches our description .
and according to tsa ,
nobody flew in yesterday under that name .
so i am taking a wild guess ,
&quot; keith nolan &quot; is an alias .
all right , so russo ...
he &apos;s out here clearing houses ,
he meets a guy who calls himself &quot; keith nolan , &quot;
he gets a vibe .
all right , i &apos;m thinking maybe
nolan could sense that russo was onto him .
he follows him and he kills him .
it &apos;s a good theory .
if we &apos;re right , i only have one question :
this guy had to have known the president was coming
before the secret service went public with it .
that &apos;s closely @-@ guarded info .
how did he get it ?
advance team &apos;s been on the ground for 36 hours .
maybe he figured it out .
yeah , mcgarrett .
wait a minute , what ?
what do you mean , she was ...
when was she arrested ?
oh , mary got arrested .
no , my aunt .
your aunt got arrested ?
i didn &apos;t see that coming .
hi .
hi .
thanks .
a second .
you okay ?
i &apos;m fine .
good .
do you want to tell me what happened ?
well , i ...
i needed some grass , and , uh ...
how was i supposed to know the guy was a narc ?
what ?
i wouldn &apos;t even be here
if it weren &apos;t for those fascists at the dispensary .
they wouldn &apos;t take my card .
the dispensary ?
what ...
yeah , and the guy behind the counter
told me where i could find some ,
and then i run into this narc ...
okay , stop , please . for a minute .
what ?
can we go back ?
yeah .
why do you have a medical marijuana card ?
i have cataracts .
you have cataracts ?
yes .
cataracts , that &apos;s what happens when you get old .
are you telling me the truth ?
look ... half the people my age get them .
deborah .
steven ... - i &apos;m a cop .
i read people for a living .
you &apos;re not telling me everything .
this isn &apos;t how i wanted to do this .
do what ?
okay , um ...
a couple of months ago , i wasn &apos;t feeling so good ,
and , um ... i was tired all the time ,
nauseous , headaches ...
so i went to the doctor
and they ran a whole bunch of tests , and , um ...
turns out ...
i have a tumor in my brain .
you have cancer ?
yeah .
how bad is it ?
it &apos;s bad .
okay , all right .
what &apos;s the plan ?
what &apos;s the course of treatment ?
well ... there is none .
there is none , it &apos;s ... it &apos;s ...
it &apos;s too far along .
no , but ... you know ,
chemo , radiation ...
no , we talked about that ,
but i ... i decided against it .
why ?
because they said it wouldn &apos;t work ...
so i ...
all right , so you just ... that &apos;s it ? you just give up ?
is that what you &apos;re gonna do ?
no , no , no , no , wait .
cause you can &apos;t do that . no , you can &apos;t ,
because that &apos;s what ... you gotta fight this .
listen to me .
i don &apos;t want to spend whatever time i have left
in some hospital ,
getting pumped full of poison
and feeling crappy all the time , okay ?
that &apos;s not how i want to do this .
this is what i &apos;ve decided .
i know ...
okay .
that &apos;s why you &apos;re here , isn &apos;t it ?
you wanted to come say good @-@ bye to us .
listen , uh ... you can &apos;t say anything to your sister .
wait , what ?
you can &apos;t do that , deb . that &apos;s not fair .
you can &apos;t keep this from her .
no , i @-@ i &apos;m gonna tell her ,
i &apos;m just waiting for the right moment , okay ? okay .
look ... you better get back to work .
i &apos;ve still gotta get booked .
you &apos;re not getting booked .
i am getting booked .
i don &apos;t want any special treatment , okay ?
i &apos;m serious .
fine . fine .
you &apos;re getting booked .
good .
i &apos;ll send someone to pick you up when you &apos;re through .
make sure he &apos;s good @-@ looking , okay ?
kid , i love you .
i love you , too .
it &apos;s gonna be all right .
so i &apos;m running through some footage that hpd pulled .
i was able to track kyle russo &apos;s movements
from a food truck he ate at
through duke &apos;s marketplace , and you guys were right .
he was followed . guy in the baseball cap .
all right , about six feet tall ,
uh , black hair , tattoo on his neck .
matches our description .
all right , keep going .
all right , chin , roll it back
let &apos;s see if you could snap in ,
get a clean frame of his face .
killer &apos;s name is dante barkov .
he &apos;s an assassin @-@ for @-@ hire .
he has no allegiance to anybody .
what are you doing to find him ?
well , we have an alert out .
we &apos;re also looking into any known associates
he may have on the island .
but right now , we don &apos;t have any leads
on his exact whereabouts .
given the circumstances ,
your boss needs to cancel his trip .
that &apos;s not gonna happen .
all due respect , sir , we &apos;re not talking about
a whack job with a six @-@ shooter , here , okay ?
this man represents a serious threat to the president .
gentlemen ...
the president won &apos;t cancel .
i mean , think of the message it &apos;d send .
the message ?
you get the feeling this gentleman isn &apos;t telling us the truth ?
oh , do you get that feeling , too ?
this trip is not about thanksgiving , is it ?
if it was , the president
would turn his plane around and go home
because of a man like this .
so why don &apos;t you level with us ,
and tell us what this smoke screen is all about ?
the president is coming for a secret meeting
with a small group from north korea .
these are one @-@ on @-@ one talks
which could lead to disarmament ,
maybe even regime change .
the stakes are huge .
he won &apos;t cancel .
gentlemen , whether we like it or not ,
air force one is wheels down at 6 : 00 p.m.
if you &apos;re right ,
barkov is still planning to assassinate the president .
we have two hours to find him .
离着陆还有两小时
i just got off the phone with fong ,
who thinks barkov might have had some help
in disposing of kyle russo &apos;s body .
it turns out that the m.o. is pretty specific .
for starters ,
the lye that was used was actually potassium lye .
it &apos;s a lot less common than the regular kind .
also , it was mixed with water , which speeds up the reaction .
i cross @-@ referenced this particular m.o.
with some old cases and got a few hits .
anyone with a connection to barkov ?
just one .
rafael moreno .
he &apos;s a cleaner for an albanian crime syndicate .
barkov allegedly did some jobs for him .
now , according to interpol ,
moreno has disappeared at least a dozen bodies
in the last 18 months .
okay , so barkov kills russo
once russo gets onto him ,
but , uh , body disposal isn &apos;t exactly in his wheelhouse .
so he calls his boy ,
rafael , who hops a flight to oahu to help out .
except for the fact that there &apos;s no record
of any rafael moreno on any inbound flights .
so he used a fake id .
which is exactly why i &apos;ve got tsa checking to see
if they took any snapshots of him while he was at the airport .
if we can determine what flight he was on ,
we can get an alias .
right , track him down here on the island ,
see if he can lead us to barkov .
hey , this is tsa now .
you got a second for me ?
for you i got a whole minute .
thank you . come here .
oh , thanks .
deb ?
yeah .
i &apos;m catherine rollins ; i &apos;m steve &apos;s friend .
friend ?
steve asked me to , uh , come pick you up
and take you back to his place .
and did he tell you anything else ?
i &apos;m so sorry .
if there &apos;s anything you need at all ,
just please let me know , okay .
thank you .
let &apos;s get you home .
no , i don &apos;t ... i don &apos;t want to go back there just yet .
where would you like to go ?
take me to the most beautiful spot on the island .
i know just the place .
come on .
i need some advice .
it &apos;s , uh , it &apos;s about my aunt .
aunt deb , she &apos;s sick .
she &apos;s sick ?
sick , uh ...
she &apos;s sick ; she &apos;s got a brain tumor .
i &apos;m sorry , man .
what , uh , what @-@ what are they gonna do ?
it &apos;s inoperable ,
but she &apos;s refusing any other kind of treatment .
i guess that &apos;s her choice , right ?
well , yeah , it &apos;s her choice , but here &apos;s the thing .
i mean , it &apos;s not just her who &apos;s gonna be affected by this .
i mean , mary ?
mary @-@ mary &apos;s gonna be destroyed if we lose her .
okay ?
first mom pulls her famous disappearing act again
and now this ?
what do i do ?
how do i ... how do i get her to change her mind ?
i don &apos;t think , uh ,
i don &apos;t think you ... i don &apos;t think you do try to change her mind .
you know , i mean , look , if this ...
is your last thanksgiving together ,
what , you want to spend it arguing ?
no .
you want to try to make some memories ,
some good memories , something that &apos;s gonna last ,
something that &apos;s gonna bring you through
whatever &apos;s coming next .
that &apos;s my opinion .
i &apos;m sorry , man .
hey , so tsa came through .
moreno flew in late last night
using the name diego silva .
rented a car using the same alias .
i was able to ping it and get a location .
five @-@ o !
hey , five @-@ o.
hey , hey , don &apos;t move . don &apos;t you move .
rafael moreno , you &apos;re under arrest .
get down on your knees .
put your hands behind your head , interlock your fingers .
really ?
you really thought that lame ass move was gonna work ?
brother , you &apos;re a lot dumber than you look .
get up .
steve , the rest of the house is clear .
there &apos;s something you &apos;re gonna want to see .
i got him , i got him .
what &apos;s the matter ?
somebody shoot you ?
&apos;cause you got a nasty boo @-@ boo .
looks like barkov &apos;s been staying here as well .
the question is where is he now ?
okay , good .
yeah , keep me posted .
that was campbell .
the secret service , did they blink ?
air force one is being diverted to kona ,
and they are pulling the security detail as we speak .
what about the house ?
csu find anything that can tell us where barkov &apos;s headed ?
no , not yet .
they &apos;re going through the garage right now .
they did find a couple bags of lye , though .
this must be where they brought russo &apos;s body .
thanks , captain .
so you gonna tell us where barkov is ?
rafael , let me , uh , you know , break it down for you ,
&apos;cause you seem like you might be confused ; i &apos;m here to help you .
uh , you &apos;re an accessory after the fact , which is , uh , it &apos;s bad .
uh , got about a half dozen international law enforcement agencies
that want to talk to you , they want to ask you questions
about some terrible things that they think you &apos;ve done .
that &apos;s just the beginning .
right , not to mention ,
barkov planned to kill the president , too .
we should add that to the list .
what ?
i don &apos;t know nothing about the president .
oh , i &apos;m sure you don &apos;t .
just like you didn &apos;t know anything
about kyle russo , right ?
how about this , rafael ?
you &apos;re gonna die in prison .
okay ?
but if you talk to us ,
then maybe , maybe we can help you .
i tell you anything about barkov ,
i end up in his crosshairs .
no , no , no .
we &apos;ll protect you .
not from him .
it is beautiful .
you know , the navy took me all around the world ,
but this ... this is home .
yeah .
you know , catherine ,
i got a feeling you &apos;re gonna be sticking around for a while .
so , um , can i ask you a favor ?
of course .
you know steve has that tough guy act down pat .
but underneath it all ,
he &apos;s still that vulnerable little guy
who thought he lost his mom and had to grow up too soon .
and mary , she &apos;s the only one who really gets that about him
because she lived it , too .
well , once i &apos;m gone ,
they &apos;re gonna need each other more than ever ,
even though they both won &apos;t want to admit it .
stubborn kids .
so ...
maybe you could see to it that they stay close ?
i will .
i promise .
thanks .
hey , steve , found a boarding pass .
it &apos;s one of barkov &apos;s known aliases .
check the arrival time .
barkov landed on oahu 12 hours before the secret service
even started their canvass .
so either this guy is psychic ...
or the president is not the target .
he &apos;s after somebody else .
who &apos;s the target , huh ?
who &apos;s the real target ?
hey , what &apos;s going on ? barkov &apos;s not here
for the president-- he &apos;s on a job .
that &apos;s right . and since barkov called moreno here
when he needed help ,
i &apos;m thinking that job was for
his old friends back in albania .
you gonna tell me who the real target is ?
huh ? guys , clear out .
csu , come on . let &apos;s clear out .
come on , what , are you gonna waterboard me now ?
i don &apos;t think so .
what &apos;s going on ? no , no ...
what &apos;s going on : you &apos;re gonna talk or you &apos;re gonna burn .
you understand ?
wait , wait . you can &apos;t do this ! hey !
who &apos;s the target ? who &apos;s the target ? !
who &apos;s the target ? ! huh ? !
okay , okay , okay !
okay . barkov &apos;s target is
a woman in kailua .
not enough !
andrea hicks ! andrea hicks !
that &apos;s all i know !
hold on , hold on . whoa , whoa , whoa .
hey . the nosy neighbor .
the one who gave us barkov &apos;s description .
her daughter &apos;s name was andrea .
what did she do to warrant a hit ?
i don &apos;t know and i didn &apos;t ask .
but barkov won &apos;t leave the island till the job is done .
no answer at sheila hicks &apos; .
catherine , what do you got ?
okay , so i &apos;ve been looking into andrea hicks .
up until two months ago , she was living in dallas ,
working as a dental hygienist . then ...
she just dropped off the grid .
do we know why ?
well , according to the fbi ,
she witnessed the murder of a high @-@ ranking member
of a russian crime family .
the feds wanted to talk to her--
she went into hiding instead .
okay , and meanwhile the family ,
they hire barkov to track her down
and shut her up , permanently .
all right , catherine , listen to me .
you keep trying to find andrea , okay ?
we &apos;re almost in kailua .
yeah , you got it .
we need to get out of here .
what ?
mom , come on ...
came from the woods .
secure the perimeter .
we need to lock it down . get your men in position .
all right , you heard the man . let &apos;s move out .
there , there , there .
oh , my god !
danny !
okay , okay .
she &apos;s gonna be okay .
she caught it in the shoulder .
what &apos;s the matter ?
you all right ?
why wouldn &apos;t i be all right ?
well , you do seem a little nervous .
nervous ?
oh , no , no . we &apos;re about to meet the president .
why are you so zen ? that &apos;s a better question .
all of you .
i &apos;m just cool like that .
you know , the president &apos;s a local boy .
that makes us practically hoapili .
i don &apos;t know what that means .
i was nervous , too , the first time .
&quot; the first time &quot; ?
when &apos;d you meet the president ?
i can &apos;t tell you that .
it &apos;s classified .
oh , it &apos;s classified , huh ? oh .
was it during , uh , operation strawberry fields ?
i &apos;ve already said too much .
how do i look ? i look all right ?
yeah , you look very handsome .
thank you .
you do , too .
thank you .
here they are , america &apos;s heroes . look at you .
no thanks necessary .
all in a day &apos;s work .
i will take one of those longboards though . thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you , brother .
all right , i want to make a toast .
uh , making the world safer for
turkey and apple pie , that &apos;s us .
speaking of turkey and apple pie , where &apos;s dinner ?
well , i &apos;m afraid , uh , mary and i struck out ,
uh , when it came to finding a turkey
big enough to feed everybody here .
but kamekona here has graciously offered
to fix ... a shrimp casserole .
hey , you guys save the world ,
i &apos;ll save supper .
no , absolutely not .
we &apos;re not eating shrimp for thanksgiving .
beggars can &apos;t be choosers , brah .
actually , they can .
uh , i have a contingency plan .
really ? what kind of plan ?
i can &apos;t tell you , it &apos;s classified .
again with the classified , huh ?
i had the talk with mary .
how &apos;d she take it ?
she &apos;s a strong girl ,
but i think right now , she needs her brother .
we &apos;re gonna get through this .
yeah ?
i just feel so bad for joan .
she &apos;s so young , and she &apos;s not gonna remember her aunt .
i know . it &apos;s okay though .
we &apos;re gonna tell her all about aunt deb .
we &apos;re gonna tell her all about how much she loved us .
all right ?
i &apos;m really sorry about the turkey .
come on .
that &apos;s the best thing that could &apos;ve happened .
boy , you &apos;re a great audience .
and because you &apos;re a great audience ,
i got a special surprise for you .
is he gonna tell that sinatra story again ?
no , i don &apos;t think so .
many , many years ago ,
my good friend john mcgarrett used to brag about
his sister singing in these legendary nightclubs
in los angeles , like the trocadero ,
ciro &apos;s and the cocoanut grove .
and the beat goes on and on .
well , i never got to hear her .
but as fate has it ,
right here tonight in this club ,
we have ... deb mcgarrett .
deb , would you please come up and sing a song
for this marvelous audience ?
you plan this ?
just making some memories , right ?
well , i certainly didn &apos;t expect this .
i mean , i haven &apos;t sung in , well ...
about a hundred years , and , uh ...
well , these old pipes are pretty rusty .
but , uh , since it &apos;s a special occasion ,
oh , what the hell .
i &apos;d like to dedicate this song to my family ,
my little ohana , steve , mary and baby joanie .
i love you all so very much .
here goes . bear with me .
maestro .
