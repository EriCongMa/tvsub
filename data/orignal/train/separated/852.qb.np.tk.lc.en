back in the &apos; 80s ,
before pilates and macrobiotic diets ,
old people were old , except for one--
my grandfather .
he was a man who loved risk and took chances .
get there ! get there !
yes ! come on , come on , come on !
he was a connoisseur of fine spirits .
oh ! muy bueno .
in a word , my grandfather was awesome .
that &apos;s game , kiddo . better luck next time .
come on , pops . let me win at least one .
that &apos;s a terrible lesson .
i &apos;m gonna beat your ass again real quick .
and in wintertime ,
when his friends retreated to florida ,
that &apos;s when we always saw a lot more of him .
bev , look at this !
billy joel &apos;s coming to town . you gotta see this !
not now , dad . i &apos;ve got three lunches to make .
look at this picture of him .
he &apos;s wearing the exact same sunglasses as i am .
yeah .
oh , yeah .
i &apos;m gonna call for tickets .
bevy ! where &apos;s my other black sock ?
in your sock drawer .
that drawer is a wasteland of unmatched pairs .
it &apos;s chaos !
then wear a different pair .
i &apos;ve already got my black one on !
ugh ! this is a nightmare !
ow ! ow ! my tooth ! my tooth !
how do you hurt yourself eating cereal ?
i bit the free toy !
if it doesn &apos;t look like cereal , don &apos;t chew on it .
dad , you &apos;re in the way !
i @-@ i &apos;m just calling the ticket broker .
you and me are gonna sit front and center .
dad , can you please go in the den ?
everywhere i step , there you are .
you &apos;re underfoot .
and billy joel can wait .
bye .
don &apos;t say &quot; bye . &quot;
your s.a.t. prep course is at 4 : 00,
so get your ass home after school .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re saying .
well , take off your walkboy .
it &apos;s called a walkman .
oh , now you can hear me ?
i wish i couldn &apos;t .
the tickets are all sold out .
let &apos;s roam around the bad neighborhoods
until we find a scalper .
dad , i &apos;ve got 17 loads of laundry to do .
i &apos;m gonna go put on my shoes , and i &apos;ll wait in the car .
all right , bevy , today i went with the blue socks ,
but we &apos;re just kicking the can down the road .
can you do me a favor ?
take my dad to work with you today .
he &apos;s been retired ten years . why would he want to do that ?
i don &apos;t care what he wants . i want him out of here .
go ask him .
hey , albert .
how would you like to come to the store with me today ?
nah .
well , i tried . he &apos;s your problem now .
my parents were together so long ,
they could have an entire fight all about you , inches away ,
without ever making a sound .
hey , albert , vic and the guys
were just talking with me the other day , and , uh ,
they were saying how much they &apos;d love you to stop by .
we all would .
for god sake , murray , can &apos;t you take a hint ?
i don &apos;t wanna go .
i understand .
and sometimes it only took a look .
but i insist .
fine .
it was january 11th , 1980 @-@ something ,
and pops was headed back to his old stomping grounds .
hey , vic .
look at this hobo i found out wandering the street .
ohh . you kidding me ?
do my eyes deceive me ?
ohh ! okay .
i &apos;m easy . try picking up that one .
hell , no .
yeah , go ahead . bust my balls .
that &apos;s what we do .
my god , look at this place .
i @-@ i barely recognize it .
yeah , i made some upgrades ,
expanded the showroom ,
put in track lighting .
what the hell &apos;s that ?
we do all our inventory on computers now .
what is this , the &quot; star wars &quot; ?
what about sheila the redhead ,
who comes in saturdays to do the books ?
oh , i got rid of her .
what ?
yeah , she &apos;d been stealing from us for years .
that &apos;s the price you pay for great gams .
now all you have to look at is vic .
oh , you &apos;ve never seen my gams .
oh , yeah , softball .
what &apos;s next , you give vic &apos;s job to a robot ?
i gotta see my office .
hey , come here a second .
listen , um ... i want you to spend the day with him .
he &apos;s got a lot of energy , and he tends to get underfoot .
hey , you &apos;ve got new glass shelves , too !
while pops was tiring out my dad ,
i was trying to keep up with my long @-@ time crush ,
dana caldwell .
you let me win !
yeah . that &apos;s what i did . oh , boy .
i should get going .
i &apos;ve gotta read &quot; to kill a mockingbird &quot; for english .
you know , i got the cliffsnotes in my room .
you wanna borrow &apos; em ?
okay .
yep , it was happening .
i had a girl in my bedroom for the very first time .
here you go .
thank you .
so ... this is your room , huh ?
this was it . the moment every man waits for .
time to show her what goes down
in adam goldberg &apos;s private quarters .
this is where the magic happens .
voila .
oh , what &apos;s that behind your ear ?
soft red ball .
just a little taste .
do you like transformers ?
what ... are they again ?
hello . they &apos;re robots in disguise .
it &apos;s an exciting time in the franchise .
they &apos;re branching out from vehicles
to dinosaurs and insects .
that ... is exciting .
do you like he @-@ man ?
i guess .
castle greyskull .
skeletor lives there . whatever .
do you like g.i. joe ?
don &apos;t answer yet .
right this way .
behold , the &quot; u.s.s. flagg . &quot;
that takes up a lot of room .
well , yeah . it &apos;s an aircraft carrier .
it &apos;s meant to hold aircraft .
it &apos;s all right there in the name .
yep , this was going perfectly .
but what happened next would really rock my world .
i ... gotta go .
thank you for your time !
... i said for no reason at all !
as baffled as i was , my dad was even more confused
when he got back from his lunch break .
little bit higher , vic .
almost got it .
whoa , whoa , whoa . what the hell is going on here ?
going out of business ? !
damn it . i was gonna surprise you .
we don &apos;t go for these gimmicks anymore .
it &apos;s a proven sales technique .
i &apos;m just juicing things up a bit .
it &apos;s not a furniture store now .
it &apos;s a hip lounge .
number one-- it is a furniture store .
number two--the two biggest enemies of furniture
are smoke and coffee .
and jheri curl juice .
three enemies !
who wants jazz ?
okay . what the hell is going on here ?
you were supposed to play gin rummy with him
in the backroom all day .
nah , he wouldn &apos;t stay put .
that old man &apos;s got so much energy and charisma .
now you can learn a thing or two from him .
ah , charisma .
i don &apos;t know what happened . it was going so great .
and then she just ran off for no reason .
why would she do that ?
&apos;cause no girl on this planet
would ever wanna make out in this room .
seriously , it looks like a nerd bomb went off in here .
i hate to admit it , but the idiot &apos;s right .
it was the toys .
so my toys freaked her out ?
the fact that you have toys freaked her out .
listen , chicks like waterbeds
and samurai swords that elegantly
hang over a fireplace .
it &apos;s a scientific fact .
he &apos;s still an idiot .
but he &apos;s right . if you want dana to like you ,
lose the toys .
i can &apos;t . they &apos;re like family .
what would you rather touch-- a boob or a dino @-@ bot ?
you took too long ! the answer is clearly &quot; boob . &quot;
you &apos;re in seventh grade , bud .
it &apos;s time to grow up .
she &apos;s right . from now on ,
you gotta stop playing with toys
and start acting like a man .
first step--
drakkar noir .
no woman can resist its alluring stink .
now you never apply it directly onto your own skin .
you simply mist ...
and walk through .
while my lesson on how to be a man had just begun ,
my dad was happy
his day with pops had come to an end .
there you are .
how &apos;d it go with my dad ? did you have a good time ?
give me a minute . can &apos;t a man take off his pants ?
have you been smoking ?
a cigar ?
two ! with some low @-@ end cognac .
your dad turned my discount furniture store
into the copacabana .
ohh . i &apos;m nauseous .
well , thank you for doing that .
you owe me . i &apos;d like , uh , some shrimp parm ...
with extra shrimp and extra parm .
i thought you said you were nauseous .
i &apos;ll fight through it .
okay , you got it .
i &apos;m not moving .
i &apos;m gonna eat right here .
all right , don &apos;t be such a baby .
it was only for one day .
or so she thought .
that one day turned into two .
... kroehler sofas for half that price .
well , it &apos;s fine . i got some good leads in the rolodex .
al , what are you doing ?
uh , what do you know ?
you found some at that price .
yeah , i &apos;ll take &apos; em all .
and those two days would turn into the longest week
of my father &apos;s life .
now that i was a man , it was time to break
some tough news to some old friends .
sorry , lion @-@ o . sorry , cheetara .
it &apos;s time to grow up .
thundercats ho !
and after five trips ,
i had successfully packed up all my toys .
mom , i &apos;m going out .
wear your jacket and your muffs .
i &apos;m a grown man !
and i was on a mission--
a mission to prove that the geeky little kid in me
was gone forever .
literally , nothing could stop me .
it &apos;s actually kind of cold out .
oh , your nose is all pink like a little kitten .
mom .
stop .
stop it .
oh . hey .
howdy .
so ... the other day when you were over at my house ,
you ran off so fast ,
that i didn &apos;t get a chance to tell you something .
the reason why i showed you my toys was
&apos;cause i &apos;ve outgrown &apos; em , and i thought maybe
your little brother might like &apos; em .
you really wanna give all your toys away ?
yeah , i &apos;ve been meaning to do it for years ,
plus i ... i need to clear some shelf space
for my cologne , beer can collection ,
and jock straps .
well , that &apos;s so nice of you .
dougie , adam goldberg brought a whole bunch of toys for you .
cool !
awesome !
had it . have it .
sell it .
have it .
wanna come in ?
sure .
okay .
now listen , and listen good , you little putz .
that &apos;s sergeant slaughter of the renegade squadron ,
and you &apos;re gonna treat him and all my toys
with the respect that they deserve ,
or so help me , i--
adam ? you coming ?
hey , you bet .
i &apos;d given up my toys ,
but pops wasn &apos;t giving up on his big plans for the store .
you busy ?
does it matter ?
well , i just discovered that the key to our success
has been here all the time .
back in the old days , before i hired you ,
i had an ad running on the local tv .
business boomed .
okay , before you say anything else ,
just know that making a commercial
is way too expensive for us .
way ahead of you , mur .
that &apos;s why we use this .
hey there , ladies .
put down those vacuum cleaners for a second .
big al &apos;s got something to say .
when your man comes home at night ,
don &apos;t you want him to see furniture
that looks just as gorgeous as you do ?
thanks , sheila .
down at the ottoman empire ,
we got sofas starting at $ 35.99 .
can you buy on credit ? you bet !
with your husband &apos;s signature , of course .
so come on down and let big al service you .
ottoman empire--
old york road and route 73 ...
i think it holds up pretty well .
i think it &apos;s amazing that there was a time
when that was okay .
we &apos;re not running this commercial .
albert , you worked so hard
making ottoman empire what it is today ,
but don &apos;t you think now is the time
to do things like play golf or take a steam
or feed the pigeons ?
pigeons . that does sound fun .
we agree ? no commercial ?
no commercial . i totally get it .
but he didn &apos;t get it .
quiet on the set !
damn it , albert .
what did i say ? !
you &apos;re gonna love this commercial , mur .
i &apos;m insane albert .
i price my furniture so low , i require hospitalization .
he &apos;s crazy al .
yeah , i get it . no commercial !
send everybody home .
oh , i can &apos;t do that .
i already hired the crew , bought this straitjacket .
it is cheaper than renting it .
vic , go away ... far away .
vic , you stay .
he &apos;s the orderly that wheels me back into the loony bin
&apos;cause my prices are bananas .
come here , albert .
look , i &apos;ve tried being nice to you all week .
i can &apos;t do it anymore .
you gotta take off the straitjacket
and go home . please !
i didn &apos;t wanna play this card ,
but i do own 51 % of the business ,
so the decision is mine .
what are you saying ?
this commercial is happening
whether you like it or not .
now if you &apos;ll excuse me , i have to go back
and get into my mentally unstable character .
you got that covered .
honey , what happened to all your toys ?
gave &apos; em away . it &apos;s cool .
can you float me roughly $ 2,000 ?
may i ask for what ?
a waterbed and a decorative samurai sword to hang above it .
a samurai sword will fall off the wall
in the middle of the night , poke your eye out ,
puncture the mattress ,
and then you &apos;ll drown in your sleep .
is that a &quot; no &quot; ?
yes , that &apos;s a &quot; no . &quot;
honey , you can &apos;t give your toys away .
you love &apos; em so much .
toys are kids &apos; stuff .
i &apos;m a man now .
as of yesterday .
a very happy , happy man .
that &apos;s barry &apos;s smell . why do you smell like barry ?
it &apos;s drakkar noir . he gave it to me .
i love to spend money on a girl ...
whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa .
what the hell ?
what did you two idiots do ?
that could mean so many things .
why did my scrumptious little baby
give away all his toys ?
we just told him the truth , mom .
yeah . he &apos;ll never get any action with his room full of toys .
he doesn &apos;t need any action . he &apos;s a little boy .
i &apos;m going over there right now and getting his toys back .
if you do , you &apos;re gonna cost him his first girlfriend .
he doesn &apos;t need a girlfriend . he &apos;s got me .
yuck .
i didn &apos;t mean girlfriend . i meant ... main lady .
that is so much worse .
i meant ...
woman in his life that he loves more than anyone else .
mom , you &apos;re in free fall . pull the rip cord .
i &apos;m going over there to get those toys back .
you two are grounded for a year .
you hear me ? a year .
glad you messed with me ? you should know better .
hey there .
what great old toys .
i &apos;m from a local charity ,
and i was wondering if you &apos;d take 20 whole dollars for them .
you &apos;re adam goldberg &apos;s mother .
okay , i didn &apos;t know you knew that .
listen ...
my son adam is
at a transitional age right now .
he &apos;s starting to mature and to have feelings
he &apos;s ... never felt before , and--
i want a turtle .
that &apos;s nice . why don &apos;t you go in and get your mom ?
go on . get mama .
hi .
you must be dana &apos;s mom .
i &apos;m beverly goldberg .
well , i &apos;ll have you over for brunch , okay ?
bye @-@ bye . this was fun .
after pops took off his straitjacket ,
he finally regained his sanity .
hey , can we talk ?
it &apos;s up to you . you &apos;re the boss .
i can give you , uh , 51 % of the couch .
stop it , will ya ? i @-@ i came to apologize .
look ...
it &apos;s tough always feeling like you &apos;re underfoot .
i was doing okay with it ,
but then when i walked back in here , uh ...
i felt like i mattered again .
stop it . you matter .
this is your store , murray .
you &apos;ve done a hell of a job with it
for ten years-- better than i could &apos;ve done .
which is why i &apos;ve decided ...
to give you this .
that &apos;s my 2 % .
you should be the majority owner .
this is your store now .
thank you , albert . it means a lot .
i &apos;m gonna miss this place .
oh , you ...
you could always come by , like , once a week
to check on things .
i can put another desk next to mine in the office .
nah . i couldn &apos;t do that .
you could .
walnut . danish modern with a teak inlay .
don &apos;t cheap out .
now come here and give me a hug .
uh , i &apos;m not a big hugger .
get over here , you bastard .
hi .
hello . what you got there , toys of some sort ?
i brought &apos; em back
&apos;cause i know you didn &apos;t really wanna give them away .
what ? no , that &apos;s not true .
your mom came over .
that damn woman .
that &apos;s okay .
my ... mom would have done the same thing
if i gave away all my care bears .
wait . it wasn &apos;t the toys ?
then why did you run out of my room the other day ?
i ... ran out &apos; cause ...
i thought we were gonna kiss .
not that i didn &apos;t wanna kiss .
i just ... got nervous .
so ...
thank you for bringing my stuff .
see you at school .
thank you !
stupid . i was supposed to kiss her .
stupid , stupid !
yeah , you blew it .
but we &apos;ll work on it .
never thought i &apos;d say it ,
but this computer is way better than sheila &apos;s gams .
hey , mur . we got a tough customer .
you wanna work your magic ?
you coming ?
you bet your ass .
yeah , getting older is confusing and complicated ,
but no matter how hard we tried ,
pops couldn &apos;t slow it down , and that day ,
i decided not to rush it either .
i am megatron , leader of the decepticons .
i am optimus prime , and i am a good guy ,
and i will kick your butt !
who &apos;s there ?
get dressed now !
oh , no ! the bad guys are coming for us !
