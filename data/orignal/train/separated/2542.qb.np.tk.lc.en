第二十七季 第四集
okay , homie ,
i &apos;m plugging it in .
wait , wait , wait , wait , wait , wait !
the gravestones could be a little more crooked .
let me just fluff up these entrails .
and ...
light it up .
halloween at the simpsons &apos; .
what a classic tradition !
are you heading up to the tree house
to tell three horrifying tales ?
ah , we &apos;re doing it next week .
it &apos;s gonna be psycho with skinner and his mom ,
muppet wizard of oz-- i &apos;m scarecrow @-@ fozzie--
and then , uh , one where furniture gets smart
and takes over the world or something .
mmm ! sounds chilling !
eh . people love it .
everscream terrors looks amazing this year .
i &apos;ve never seen black cats with such arched backs .
well , you gotta bring it .
halloweening your house is a dying art .
more and more people are turning off their porch lights
and pretending they &apos;re not home .
halloween skippers .
skippers !
how can you reject a holiday
where you can serve candy from a salad bowl ?
bad news , dad .
you stored the plastic skeletons
too close to the furnace .
eh , i &apos;ll take it to the old folks &apos; home
and tell granpa it &apos;s his new roommate .
everyone in the car !
we &apos;re making a skeleton run
to the halloween pop @-@ up store .
ooh , while we &apos;re there
we can get a costume for the dog .
nothing says you love a pet
like letting him be part of the human fun .
who wants to be a yoda ?
you want to be a yoda !
oh , man , i can &apos;t wait for tonight !
i &apos;m finally old enough
for krustyland halloween horror night .
oh , yeah , they do it up right .
wait till you try the black cotton candy .
it tastes just like cotton candy .
tomorrow , when my friends ask me about it ,
i &apos;m going to say , &quot; eh , it wasn &apos;t that big a deal . &quot;
but it &apos;s gonna be a really , really big deal !
welcome , seasonal customer ,
to my pop @-@ up emporium .
behold my terrifying joke name .
a @-@ boo !
hmm , you know , i actually like that better .
why are you not working ?
&apos;cause i &apos;m still coming down
from huffing all that glow stick juice , man .
oh , i &apos;m strung out on silly string .
go , go ! back to work !
go de @-@ tangle the novelty cobwebs ,
you lazy trick @-@ or @-@ treat trash .
aren &apos;t you being a little hard on them ?
mrs. simpson ,
these are pop @-@ up people .
temporary workers who drift from town to town ,
holiday to holiday ,
living off candy hearts and sleeping on easter grass .
if i do not show them a firm hand ,
they would rob me like striped hamburger thief
robs restaurant meat clown .
ooh ! mariachi skeletons .
they &apos;re spooky , but they also teach you about mexico .
psst ! hey , big man , how about this deal :
you buy one from me-- in cash--
and i &apos;ll load three more into your car for free .
that is a great deal .
just don &apos;t tell old man squishee about it .
you got some great guys working here .
they just gave me a really good deal .
really ?
tell me of this deal .
okay , but don &apos;t tell old man squishee about it .
we hate him .
get out . out , all of you !
pop @-@ up scum ! out !
no one rips off apu nahasapeemapetilon !
now take your suspiciously full duffle bags and go !
you &apos;re gonna be real sorry for getting us fired .
well , i &apos;m sorry now .
yeah , you &apos;re gonna be .
i said , i &apos;m sorry now .
we said you &apos;re gonna be !
i know when i &apos;m sorry , and i &apos;m sorry now !
you guys don &apos;t know me at all .
hand stamp required for re @-@ entry !
that &apos;s not scary .
i thought this was going to be scary .
scary !
that &apos;s really , uh , anatomical .
lot of anatomy there .
oh , yeah , the gore is super realistic .
it &apos;s gotta be--
today &apos;s consumer is just too sophisticated .
i want to go home ! i want to go home !
what ? no !
we just got here !
lisa , honey , i think you should stay .
and not because the tickets were super expensive ,
even though they were super expensive .
but remember , you were really looking forward
to the fun of being scared
by stuff you know isn &apos;t real .
unlike the money i spent on this , which is very real .
okay .
okay , i &apos;ll give it another try .
good , now take my hand
and i &apos;ll walk you through this roiling zombie horde .
this isn &apos;t real .
this isn &apos;t real . this isn &apos;t real .
this isn &apos;t real .
sir ? sir ?
i @-@ i &apos;m not ...
hold on , lisa ,
daddy &apos;s picking out a pretzel topping .
sir ?
oh , no , i &apos;m lost !
okay , find a grown @-@ up .
find a grown @-@ up .
excuse me , i &apos;m lost .
could you please help me ...
i can &apos;t find my family
and i &apos;m really scared and i ...
sir , looks like we &apos;ve got
a scaredy @-@ pants situation here .
zoom in and scan for fear .
terror level seven and rising .
shut it down . shut it all down .
shut the whole damn thing down .
attention !
bring all laughter and exhilaration
to a complete stop .
the terrifying good time is on hold .
we have located and are removing
the baby that thinks this is real .
reset time is 65 minutes .
all parking validations are now void .
sir ...
lisa , aren &apos;t you going to wear
your costume to school ?
no , i &apos;m not doing halloween this year .
oh , sweetie , i know you had a scare last night .
but you worked so hard on your frida kahlo outfit .
maybe just wear the eyebrow and mustache ?
no !
no !
you kids look great .
delightful .
no place like home .
hold on , simpson .
let &apos;s take a look at that buccaneer costume .
no weapons , of course .
bandana , possible gang wear .
eye patch , offensive to the half @-@ blind .
oh , and just to reassure
those who are afraid of pirates ...
no ! leave me alone !
leave me alone !
lisa ...
homer ...
i think we should take down everscream terrors .
wha-- w @-@ we ... we can &apos;t !
i &apos;m the mozart of halloween decorations ,
and tonight is the super bowl .
lisa &apos;s in a bad place .
you know how sensitive she is .
we don &apos;t want her to go back to ...
tailee .
no , she wouldn &apos;t .
she couldn &apos;t .
not tailee .
where is she ?
ah , let &apos;s see .
oh , god .
we &apos;re too late .
the glue stick didn &apos;t hold .
so , tailee &apos;s back .
tailee just makes me feel so safe .
i don &apos;t know why i ever gave it up .
it breaks my heart
that lisa can &apos;t deal with her emotions without a crutch .
well , kids are weak , marge .
oh , yeah .
no . no !
stop it !
why are you taking down everscream terrors ?
our house has to be a halloween @-@ free zone .
your sister has a tummy ache in her courage .
what ?
lisa goes nuts and you turn us into ...
into skippers ? !
i know what this makes us .
i know !
honey , i knew you &apos;d be upset ,
and that you &apos;d think only of yourself .
so i &apos;m taking you to the best
trick @-@ or @-@ treating block party
in the tri @-@ springfield area .
there &apos;s a dad who &apos;s a deejay .
even an e.t. who says your name .
what if i tell the e.t. my name is a swear ?
he &apos;ll have to say it .
then i &apos;m in .
okay , sweetie ,
just you and me spending a regular eve together .
nothing hallows about it .
i &apos;m sorry i ruined halloween , dad .
ruined ?
why , you just created a new holiday ...
puzzle wednesday .
a tabby and a calico .
i wouldn &apos;t want to be that ribbon .
oh , trick @-@ or @-@ treaters .
don &apos;t worry , i &apos;ll get rid of them .
trick or treat .
porch light &apos;s off , kids .
don &apos;t you know what that means ?
we &apos;re not here for candy , big man .
hey , you &apos;re those pop @-@ up scuzzos .
what do you scuzzos want ?
we want our jobs back .
look , i don &apos;t want to be rude ,
but you sad losers should go suck somewhere else .
that ? oh , that was just
a kindly priest here to bless our home .
i told him to keep moving .
another visitor ?
isn &apos;t life funny and safe ?
can &apos;t you jerks take a hint ? !
mind games .
whoa , look at this line .
this neighborhood has to be good .

we will , we will .
look , i &apos;ve got a groupon here for a zip line adventure .
let us in , and it &apos;s yours .

hello , scrotum .
it &apos;s over .

but i &apos;m scared , too ,
but you can &apos;t let fear shut down your brain ,
because between the two of us , we &apos;ve only got one good one .
i &apos;ve got it .
what if ... we use these decorations to signal for help ?
you &apos;re right .
