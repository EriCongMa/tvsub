I now pronounce you husband and wife.
Did you tell Yvonne to leave her phone at lunch?
yes.
You wanted me to find something.
The night Charlotte came home, the night she was murdered.
Someone used the landline from the Two Crows
to call this house.
I will go to my boss, and I'll tell her the truth.
You can't do that. She'll kick you to the curb.
Melissa's suitcase is broken.
The pull-up handle is missing a rod.
It could've been used as a weapon.
Jordan, sorry I haven't called you back.
I think I picked a date.
The Phillips camp believes the leak came out of our office.
It's about her daughter.
Yvonne?
She got rid of an unwanted pregnancy.
I leaked it.
Gather your things and leave here.
Go in there and tell my mother the truth.
If there needs to be a scapegoat, let it be me.
They may have found the weapon.
What?
And they were willing to kill me to get it back.
Did Sara Harvey come after you?
It wasn't her. Sara Harvey wants this murder solved.
Whoever this was, they wanna cover it up.
You want me to marry you to each other?
It's just so weird.
I mean, I barely know the guy's first name
and now he's married to Ali?
Right, well, I'm sure he seems like a stranger to us
but Alison and Elliott have known each other for years.
Hey, they just started going out.
I mean, what is this, her second date?
Whatever happened to dinner and a movie?
Um, Han, there's lipstick on that fork.
I'm sure it seems strange
but if you saw Alison and Elliott
it was...it was pretty romantic.
I don't think romance has anything to do with it.
Ali's lost everyone she's ever cared about.
She's desperate for a family.
Maybe she's smart.
If you elope, no one can throw you a bridal shower.
Since when do you not like bridal showers?
Gifts, expensive lingerie, cake?
Like, made for you.
Not when we have two monsters after us.
Spencer's not answering.
Yeah, well, she's probably still dealing
with the fallout from the Yvonne leak.
There's no way Spencer's parents will believe Caleb did that.
Yeah, well, be glad that they do because if they thought
that we had a new A, they would march
straight down to the police station.
You guys, our stalker already warned us.
Okay? If we talk to the cops
we're gonna have targets on our backs.
We already do.
Melissa tried to turn me into road kill last night.
No, she is not the one sending texts
and going after Yvonne.
Spencer could just tell Toby.
I mean, he could quietly go--
No, if we talk to Toby, there's nothing quiet about that.
The whole Rosewood police force will be on a manhunt.
Okay, can we just talk about something nice for a second?
I want my cake back.
Check out the pictures from the wedding.
Your parents look so happy.
Great job on the dress, Han.
That's weird. I'm in this picture.
I wonder who took this one.
What is that?
Wait, there's more.
Oh, my God.
Obviously, Gil diffused the situation
and your mother's apologized to Yvonne and her family.
And she..
Could you please turn that off while I'm talking?
Sorry.
Thank you.
Several members of the press have caught wind of the fact
that the "Social media consultant"
that was responsible for all the leaks
is your boyfriend.
I think it would be wise to put out a statement
you know, distancing yourself from him.
What? Why?
This morning, Toby spoke with the media.
Issued a personal statement.
He did?
Yeah.
Naturally voicing his support for his girlfriend
and taking a swipe at our "nasty political tactics."
Does he know that it was Caleb who did it?
Why are you so protective of Caleb?
I mean, come on, Spence.
Don't we all have a better idea of who he really is now?
I-I have to go to the campaign office.
Um, dad, would you please tell Melissa to call me?
She hasn't been answering her phone.
She left for London.
Her office needed her back.
What?
Wait, why would she leave right before the election?
Why don't you stop worrying about Melissa
and start focusing your attention on helping your mom?
Also might wanna think about what you're gonna say to Toby.
Is this too risque for the party?
You know what, honestly, maybe we should just cancel the party.
You know, reschedule it for another time.
What?
Look, your hotel has that big thing for election night and--
The party is tomorrow.
We can't cancel.
You have friends coming in from New York--
And I have friends who have already left.
Ali can't come. She had to go out of town.
It's a long story.
Okay, well, maybe now you can invite Mona instead.
Honey, it's the first time in years
that you and your friends have all been in the same place.
Yeah, because of a murder investigation.
You need this.
All of you do.
It will be a good distraction.
How was your parents' wedding?
Um, good.
Good. Small.
Did you want something to eat?
Oh, no, I can't stay long.
I'm going to lunch with Liam.
Oh, that's right. Yeah.
He seems, he seems bright.
He is.
He's very bright.
Look, um, I-I came here because I needed to know
what you wanted me to do.
About the-the book.
How do you want me to handle it?
So I might have already handled it.
I spoke to Jillian this morning
'cause I wanted to give you credit
and make sure that you didn't lose your job over this
and I sort of ended up...
...pitching you as co-writer.
What?
Well, I mean, she-she loved the female voice that you gave,
and I suggested that we..
...write the book together.
Sort of a-a man and woman in dialogue.
I'm so sorry, I probably should've talked to you about this first.
No, don't be.
I-I am so, so flattered.
But...no, Jillian's never gonna go for that.
I'm an assistant over there.
Aria, Jillian seems open to this.
So... are you?
Wait, how did this happen?
More like, how did we not see this coming?
Melissa's done this so many times before
she probably has some special fugitive rate from the airlines.
Okay, so the only way we'll be able
to confront her is on video chat?
Doesn't matter. I'll just have to prove
she did it without her actually being here.
Oh, and by the way, your mom called
about the bar menu for the shower.
What's a "pink drink"?
Oh, God.
Is she talking about some kind of...
Em?
Em, are you there?
I've heard that sound before.
Alright, I will place a rush order
and hopefully, the stock we have will last...
...until we can..
I-I'll stay in a broom closet.
I'm sorry, Ben, can you, uh excuse me a second?
I need a place to say.
Caleb?
Is everything okay?
Uh, yeah, I just, uh
I'm just trying to get a room for tonight.
I thought you were staying with the Hastings.
Yeah, I was.
When I was working on the campaign.
Uh, which I no longer am.
What happened?
Alright, I'll tell you what, why don't I make some calls
to some other hotels and maybe--
No, no, thank you.
I already tried actually.
This was sort of my last stop.
Thanks.
Caleb!
You know, if you can't find any place else to stay
you can always stay in the guest room.
You know it well.
There's probably still one of your old beanies
you know, stuffed in the dresser.
I actually, I left it for you
in case you ever wanted to clean your chimney flue or something.
I really appreciate the offer, but, um..
... I'll figure it out.
Oh, hey.
Hey. Oh, congratulations on the book.
Aria told us you may be..
Annoying, isn't it?
It's made even worse with zero sleep
and a writing deadline.
Have-have you heard that noise before?
Whistle-tips.
Sorry?
It's a piece that goes in the exhaust pipe of a car
makes that high-pitched whining sound.
So you're saying that noise is on purpose?
Yeah, I think it's a sad desperate plea for attention
but I don't know, maybe I'm cranky from lack of sleep.
Melissa, please, just call me
the second your plane lands, okay?
I really need..
I really need to talk to you.
Bye.
I'm coming.
Toby..
Where is he?
Caleb isn't here, okay?
And I know that you're upset--
He knows her.
She's not some faceless, nameless..
She's not even a candidate, okay?
She didn't choose to put her life under a microscope.
I know. But there's just so much about this that you don't know.
When the Phillips campaign manager told me
it was Caleb that did this
I told him he-he must've had his wires crossed.
I said that there's no way.
I told him, "I know this guy.
And I would bet my life that he would never
do something like this."
I'm glad he didn't take that bet.
Hey, Toby.
Toby, hey, just let him explain, okay?
There's nothing to explain.
She thought you were a friend.
I thought you were a friend.
I'm sorry she's hurting.
Caleb, just tell him.
So you're not even gonna deny it was you.
No. I can't.
I wanna hear it from you!
I want to hear it from your mouth why you did this.
Toby, stop, okay? Caleb, tell him!
I did what I had to do.
Oh, my God!
I called the auto shop, but no one answered
so I'm gonna go over there.
And do what, pretend like you're gonna trick out your sedan?
It's not funny, Hanna.
Once I can prove that Melissa borrowed that SUV
I'm telling the police.
You saw that message from this morning.
We're running out of time.
Hanna?
Can you help me turn on the air?
Earlier, I tried to use the oven
and Beyonce started playing.
I told you, it's all linked up.
It's like a smart loft.
Yeah, well, smart loft, dumb hostess.
I need two buttons, on and off.
So I ran into Caleb today.
At the hotel. He said he lost his job.
Do you know what happened?
Not exactly.
Well, I hope you don't mind
but I offered him the guest room.
Every place in town is booked.
Wait. What?
Mom, I-I do mind.
You're gonna let him stay in our house?
My house, and it seemed like
he didn't have any place else to go.
He's an adult, not a pound puppy.
Hanna!
This is someone you cared about.
He was a big part of your life.
Just admit it.
You like Caleb more than you like Jordan.
What?
You've never given Jordan a real chance.
You've compared every guy I've ever dated to Caleb--
That's crazy.
I think Jordan is great.
I just don't know him as well as I know Caleb.
Yeah, well, how could you?
You don't try to spend time with him.
I have invited you both back here on multiple occasions.
You know, forget it. I don't wanna talk about this.
Hey, Han? Um, I'll see you later, okay?
Yeah.
Hold still.
Do you want me to do this or not?
Not. I keep saying "Not,"
and you keep ignoring me.
Hold still.
Come here.
You should just tell him the truth.
It's just gonna make things worse.
How?
How could it possibly make things any worse?
What do you wanna do?
Do you wanna waltz into Rosewood PD
and tell them to slap cuffs on a girl with no hands?
She has hands. And yes,
if I was sure that it was Sara Harvey
who's behind all of this.
But she shut her spy hole, and she's left town.
Wait. You don't think it's her?
I don't know.
Maybe there's somebody who's helping her?
But whoever it is, they're getting impatient.
Because if we don't give them the killer
in the next couple of days then...
Don't.
I'm not gonna let anybody hurt you.
It's kind of hard for me to take comfort from that
when you still have blood coming out of your nose, okay.
Come here.
There.
I'd rather have Toby hate me now
than blame me later, you know?
I know.
You did not have to do all this.
I would've been fine just eating leftovers from the wedding.
No, that's what an expense account is for.
taking my girlfriend out for a porcini omelet
and billing it as lunch with a client.
Well, it's funny
because that may not be as big a lie as you think.
Ezra called Jillian
to try and get me off the hook and
ended up asking for me to be his co-author.
I mean, obviously, I had no idea
that he was gonna do that.
He didn't even
have any idea he was gonna do that.
Oh, yeah, he did.
It wasn't an accident. He didn't fall off a bicycle.
He made a decision.
I'm sorry.
This is a great opportunity
and I'm really happy for you.
You're gonna be a published author.
That's amazing.
Is this your way of thanking me?
Sorry?
The leak. About Yvonne?
Okay, Caleb and I had nothing to do with it.
How do I know that you didn't do it?
I mean, accusing other people of something that you've done
that does have kind of a vintage Mona quality about it.
Unbelievable.
I genuinely do something good and I end up paying for it?
Because of the leak, the Phillips team
has gone through everything with a fine-toothed comb.
My gift of your mom's medical records was discovered.
I've been fired, my credibility is shot
my future jeopardized, and now
the one person who should be kissing my feet
is here accusing me of screwing her.
Yeah, she's a powerful character.
Thank you.
Oh, I-I really like, uh, what you did.
The end of chapter five, the passage--
Oh, good. Good, good.
Yes.
Yeah, I-I love this section here about the bridge.
Do you actually think it works?
I was trying to make it a metaphor for the...
Yeah, no, it's great.
I totally got it.
Great.
Oh, um, I had a few thoughts this morning.
Let's see this.
Uh, that I'd love to talk to you about now...
if I can just find them.
Ezra...
why do you want me to write with you?
I-I mean, this would be huge for me
and-and it is not that I don't think my work is good.
I just..
I have to ask, 'cause, you know..
Well, I do.
Well..
Nicole's voice was, um..
taken away.
And I wanna give it back.
But I didn't know her.
I know, that's why I need you.
'Cause I would spend the whole time spinning in place
trying to be faithful to reality, and you're not..
tied down by that.
I know it is a lot to ask, but..
could you please help me with this?
Of course.
It's okay.
I've never enjoyed the feeling of deja vu myself.
Lieutenant.
Would it be possible for me to speak
with Miss Montgomery alone?
Something wrong?
That's kind of an open-ended question.
Don't you think?
What are you doing here?
I have an eyewitness from the Two Crows Diner.
They saw the person who called the DiLaurentis
on the night of Charlotte's murder.
Okay, what does that have to do with me?
Well, maybe nothing. But you fit the description.
And I'd like it if you come in for a line-up.
I gave you my statement.
I didn't leave the hotel that night.
And I've never even been to the Two Crows Diner.
Good.
This will give us a chance to eliminate you as a suspect.
Come forward, number three.
Please step forward.
Return to the line.
Number four, step forward.
Head up, please. Face forward!
Number four, return to the line.
Hi.
Um... I was wondering if anyone
recently brought in a dark gray SUV into the shop?
Uh, maybe someone looking to get their muffler--
Can't help you.
Okay, does that mean that they haven't or..
It means that I can't help you.
Thank you for your help.
What in the hell do you think you're doing?
Um, th-this is the truck that I was asking about.
Do you know who drove this last night?
Maybe I lent it to a friend. I can't remember.
Okay, um..
does this happen to be your friend?
That's not her.
You need to go.
Thank you. Miss Montgomery, did you forget something?
Is your eyewitness Sara Harvey?
We don't reveal the identity of witnesses.
Otherwise, people would be scared to speak up.
Oh, I'm sure that she couldn't wait.
The person that you should be questioning
was on your side of the glass!
Just a minute.
Yes, Lieutenant Tanner.
Yeah.
Give me that name again.
I think we had him in lock up March of last year.
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.
Let me check on his..
I believe we picked him up on a DV
but I'll have to check.
I'll have one of my guys call you back.
Okay, okay, yeah, yeah.
Now. Would you like to fill out the complaint form?
A complaint form?
Five years ago, you found me, underground..
I would just think that after everything that's happened
you would take what I say seriously.
I do.
I take every accusation seriously.
It doesn't mean I have to act on it right away.
And because of that, you are free to go.
I don't get it.
If Sara was framing us, then why were you free to go?
Maybe that's what Tanner meant when she said
the police don't always act
on every accusation right away.
So all we can do is wait for the other shoe to drop?
Hanna? You can't neglect your other guests.
Why don't you lead the group in some icebreakers?
Sure. As soon as Spencer gets here.
Well, where is she?
Nice to see how much you take our little chats to heart.
What?
Yeah, less then 24 hours after my request..
...Caleb's in the house.
Dad, he had to get some clothes. And how did you eve--
Then a park bench?
Right?
You cannot just ask me
to cut this person out of my life.
Do I look like I'm asking?
Spence, listen..
...I, I know how painful this is.
And maybe Caleb had good intentions
but his actions prove that he doesn't share
the same value system as this family.
Oh, my God.
Can you really look at me
and say that with a straight face?
You are protecting her!
She killed someone, and you shuttle her off to Europe?
What kind of value system is that?
She didn't kill anyone. She was being blackmailed.
What are you talking about?
Right before Charlotte's hearing..
...your sister started getting threatening messages.
Someone claimed to have her on tape
confessing to burying Bethany.
That can't be true, dad.
She was told to drop money off
at a disclosed location
or the video would be released.
That's why she came back to Rosewood in secret.
Who was blackmailing her?
She doesn't know.
But she dropped off the money
and just hoped everything would go away.
Then Charlotte turned up dead.
O-okay, so then why flee?
You said that she had nothing to do with it.
She got spooked, Spence.
Why didn't you tell her to go to the police?
I was scared.
Okay, I was scared that, like you
they would think she was guilty of more than just being..
Blackmailed? Do we really believe that?
Well, even if it is true, isn't that more of a reason
Melissa would've wanted Charlotte dead?
Yeah, but Charlotte was still on lockdown
when Melissa made her first payment.
So what are you saying?
The person who's threatening us is probably the same person
who was blackmailing my sister.
I don't think it was Melissa who borrowed that SUV.
I looked at the pictures. One look at that crowd
and her argyle socks would have blown off.
Which leaves us with nothing.
No, there's the eyewitness report.
A hot brunette with a cheesy keychain?
That's like half this party.
Ladies, if you could all move to the sofa.
Sweetie, I thought you could open your presents now.
If any of you guys got me some kind of toy
you're dead.
Congratulations, Han.
I just wanted to drop that off.
I figured you'd get a kick out of it.
Remember the summer before eighth grade?
We were all set to have double weddings.
I was gonna marry Justin Timberlake
and... you were gonna tie the knot with Matt Damon.
I can't believe you still have this.
That's so thoughtful of you, Mona.
Why don't you come in for a drink?
Hanna was just about to open more gifts.
I don't wanna intrude, but ...sure.
Okay, uh, it's time for 21 Questions.
This version is
"How well do you know the bride and groom?"
So whoever gets the most points wins a prize.
So first question for 100 points.
Where did Jordan propose?
Why is she here?
I thought you two had it out at The Brew.
She brought a gift.
Yeah, and an ax to grind.
Emily, for 50 points.
Do you know this one?
"How did the bride and groom meet?"
Yeah.
I, I think it was at a work function.
No, no, it was, it was at- at a party.
Sorry. Spencer?
Wait, I know this.
You know what, this game is kind of silly.
Isn't there one where
everyone takes a shot when you hear the word bride?
What is wrong with this thing?
Hanna!
I don't know how to make it stop.
Here, here.
What is happening?
I have no idea.
Is that the air conditioner?
What is that?
Somebody turn it off!
Aria!
Oh, my God!
Okay. Yeah, just give me a call.
Well, she's just been admitted to the ER.
I mean, she has second-degree burns
but the doctors say that she's gonna be fine.
How did this even happen?
Why don't you ask her?
I mean, is it just a coincidence
that the loft tried to turn Aria
into a s'more right after she arrived?
托比
How long does this take?
Three minutes. Said on the package.
I have to go.
Who was that? Hannah?
No, it was
it- it was my dad.
But I'll call you later.
Bye.
Do you wanna talk about it?
Talk about what?
What we're gonna do if--
Toby, I'm a sophomore... okay?
I'm having a hard enough time juggling exams.
I know.
And you don't even live in this state.
I-I know, but I..
could apply for a transfer.
And what? You gonna move into my dorm room?
You don't have to..
say it like that.
Like what?
Like... living together
would be such a horrible thing.
In this context, it would be.
I'm sorry, but it would.
You're..
talking about this like it would..
ruin our lives.
I mean, isn't this what we are planning for..
eventually?
I- I don't know.
You know, I really..
I hadn't really thought that far ahead.
I haven't even made up my mind yet
about grad school, I don't..
Well, have you-have you made up your mind about me?
Don't make this about something that it isn't.
'And what about you?'
I'm not the only person here who has plans.
You know, you said that you wanted to quit the force
and you said that you wanted to go back to school.
That was your idea, not mine.
And it was only because being with a cop
isn't good enough for you.
I have never said that, okay?
I just, I don't know, I thought that maybe you wanted--
More?
Can we please not do this right now?
This is really hard.
I'm sorry. I'm not trying to make it harder.
'It's just..'
...I feel like..
...when we're picturing our future together..
...we're not..
...looking at the same picture anymore.
'Spencer.'
Toby.
Um, thanks for coming to see me.
Yeah, I-I can't stay long. I'm on duty so--
Yeah, of course.
Caleb doesn't know that I'm here.
If-if you're gonna try and get me--
He didn't do it.
Okay? He didn't leak it.
He's just taking the blame.
Why?
Because "A" is back.
Not "A" exactly, just, umm..
...some copycat version.
What?
Whoever this is thinks that we know who killed Charlotte
and so they're trying to make our lives miserable because of it.
And I'm really sorry, but Yvonne was just collateral damage.
And Caleb didn't wanna tell you
because he didn't wanna put you at risk.
Thank you for telling me.
How are you? Are you okay?
Yeah. I'm okay.
I just, um..
...I really couldn't have you thinking
that I would ever judge Yvonne for making that choice.
Not after..
...you and I..
...almost had to make that choice.
Yeah.
I-I gotta go.
Okay. How's Yvonne?
Uh, she's-she's been amazing, you know.
Just really strong.
I guess I have a type.
Take care of yourself.
You too.
You okay?
How did you know that I..
'Hannah. She texted me.'
Are you in any pain?
Well, they gave me something.
It's not completely helping.
Aria, I'm-I'm so sorry.
Um, I told Hannah and her mother
that if they needed rest that I could take you home.
Nurse says it's gonna be a long night.
Well..
...I'm prepared for that.
We have..
...reading material, uh, spare clothes.
Unfortunately, they're my clothes
but I'm pretty sure we can find some medical tape
that I can just sort of cinch around the top of the sweatpants.
Uh, I have Gummy Bears. I have several sets of..
Don't be scared.
You want the doctor-- - No.
Aria, it's a terrible accident.
It wasn't an accident.
What?
What do you mean?
Nothing.
Nothing, I..
It was my fault.
I shouldn't have been standing so close to the fireplace.
Mom, I'm really sorry for being such a Bridezilla.
And clearly, I'm the one who hasn't been including
Jordan enough in my life, not the other way around.
Can I ask you a question?
Why have you iced out Mona?
I saw the way you and your friends
reacted when she showed up.
I think a sewer rat
would have gotten a warmer welcome.
Well, she wasn't invited.
Why not?
Clearly, you mean a great deal to her.
Has something happened since the investigation started?
Honestly, I don't know what Mona's been up to lately.
What does that mean?
Nothing.
Look, we're both tired.
I'm gonna get us some coffee.
Don't stop, it was working.
Uh, I was definitely starting to feel sleepy.
Mm. So was I.
Okay, um..
"This season is all about the prints."
"The bolder, the brighter, the better."
"But how, you ask, can I incorporate
such strong design elements into my wardrobe?"
You know, maybe there's something snappier
in the waiting room, like a-a car manual.
It's informative.
If it's informative you want
I suggest we give that pamphlet
on staph infection another shot.
Wasn't true what you said earlier.
About the writing.
I have a creative baggage too.
Wanting to make you proud.
Oh, thank God you're okay.
Liam. Hey.
I'm so sorry.
My phone died on the way back from Philly.
And I-I came here as soon as I heard the message.
Hey, man.
I appreciate you being here.
Yeah, of course.
Oh, let me be the first to share the good news.
Jillian approved the book.
What? That's amazing.
That's great.
Yeah, congratulations.
You're gonna be an author.
Hey, um..
...congratulations.
And, uh, feel better.
Thank you.
Bye.
You should see the email Jillian sent me. You hungry?
Can I get you something to eat from the cafeteria?
Hey, Yvonne.
Um, this is Spencer Hastings.
I know that I'm probably the last person
that you wanna hear from right now but..
...I just really wanted to say that I'm sorry.
I'm really, really sorry.
And if you ever need anybody to talk to..
...I know that there's probably a million other people
that you'd wanna talk to before me, but..
...I'm here.
Is there any more?
No. That's it.
You didn't have to stay. I could've done this myself.
It seems whatever I do ends up this way.
Good intentions that look like trash.
Sorry.
You need a ride?
No, that's okay.
Mine's right here.
Was it you?
Did you call Charlotte that night
from the Two Crows Diner?
