good morning , almost husband !
good morning , almost ...
oh , calm down .
this can &apos;t be the first time
you woke up with another men in your bedroom .
happy wedding day !
what are you doing here ?
you pay for a full @-@ service wedding ,
you get our full packages .
oh , close , honey , so close .
and we are crossing ...
we &apos;re crossing
and trays down .
napkin .
relax . enjoy .
the car will pick you up at 4 : 00
to whisk you away to your beautiful hilltop wedding .
how &apos;s the weather ?
i had a dream it rained on everyone .
dry as a bone .
the only thing it will be raining tonight is men .
we really need it .
has anyone heard from sal ?
no .
and i will never understand
why you asked that boozy us @-@ hag to
officiate your wedding .
we didn &apos;t exactly ask sal .
sal ...
... we have something very important to talk to you about .
yeah , we hope that maybe you would be open to the idea --
yes ! i will totally officiate your wedding !
oh , my drinks !
it was supposed to be an intervention .
hey , best man .
hello , blushing bride .
i feel like i should hate that more .
yeah , i think i might go with &quot; best person . &quot;
anyway , i &apos;m just calling
to see how you &apos;re doing .
i &apos;m great .
really ?
i @-@ i-- is this about mom again ?
i told you -- i &apos;m fine .
my mother can &apos;t come to the wedding .
she was at a yoga retreat ,
and she fell out of a warrior pose ,
and she broke her hip .
should we consider the possibility
that someone pushed her ?
cam , please .
they were a bunch of peace @-@ loving hippies
who spent two weeks in the rainforest with my mother .
of course someone pushed her .
i &apos;m actually relieved she &apos;s not coming .
she &apos;s given me the gift
of a crazy @-@ free wedding .
i know . i was just a little sad for you .
mom &apos;s a no @-@ show ,
and you and dad are hardly even speaking .
enough about dad .
he doesn &apos;t get gay weddings ,
and i don &apos;t get track suits as casualwear .
can we please talk about something happy ,
like my honeymoon in mexico ?
oh , yeah , you &apos;re gonna want to take a look at the weather channel .
hilarious .
love you .
love you , too .
you &apos;re gonna get the gift today , right ?
don &apos;t we have a year to do that ?
no , i have a husband to do that .
they fell in love with
this very specific turquoise italian glass bowl .
i looked everywhere , finally found one ,
and we &apos;re not going to that wedding without it .
wait . i @-@ i thought you were taking me to the eye doctor .
they said i &apos;m not supposed to drive myself home .
no , no , no , no .
i &apos;m picking up luke from his wilderness trip .
alex can take you .
that &apos;s a bummer .
aww , dad , i &apos;m touched .
no , not because of you . i &apos;d just rather pick up luke .
than go to the eye doctor .
i @-@ i love spending time with you .
don &apos;t worry -- you &apos;re fun .
my dad would never admit this ,
but when he wants fun ,
he goes straight to luke .
they have a weird connection .
they &apos;re like batman and robin .
dad and i are more like
batman and ruth bader ginsburg .
honey , don &apos;t be like that .
you &apos;re super fun !
you sure i can &apos;t get luke ?
i heard that !
let &apos;s do this !
hello .
hey , mom . gloria wants to know
if she can do your hair and makeup last
after me and cam &apos;s mom .
it &apos;s fine .
something about luke -- i &apos;ve lost interest .
okay , love you . bye !
damn , this is the best cup of coffee i ever had .
manny roasts his own beans every friday night .
that kid &apos;s gonna be roasting his own beans for a long time ,
if you know what i mean .
can i just say thank you again for letting us stay here ?
you have thanked us enough with that big bag of deer meat .
hey , mom .
can you see this ?
what pimple ?
i knew it .
i can &apos;t go looking like this .
weddings are where you meet girls .
not at this one .
well , we better be going .
yeah .
have a great spa day .
men don &apos;t have spa days .
we &apos;re just going to the club , taking a steam ,
having a couple of rubdowns .
do they serve cucumber water at that place ?
sometimes they do a strawberry @-@ basil mix .
merle ?
yes , ma &apos;am ?
be back in time for me to do your tie .
uh , yes , ma &apos;am .
i &apos;m so sorry you had to see that .
see what ?
the way we just snapped at each other .
are you joking ?
obviously , merle and i are going through a heck of a rough patch .
if i talked to jay that nice ,
he would think i &apos;m cheating on him .
mrs. p ...
... my darn taxi never came .
i &apos;m gonna miss my flight .
no .
i just --
i don &apos;t want to deal with this right now
&apos;cause i &apos;m already so scared of flying .
i just hate everything about it --
except for the food .
i don &apos;t understand how they get such bold flavors
out of that tiny kitchen .
haley , can you drive andy to the airport , please ?
she doesn &apos;t want to do that .
aww , you get me .
haley .
i don &apos;t have a car . i got dropped off .
i guess we can take my car .
that &apos;s settled . go .
fine .
okay .
we really need to hurry .
relax . we &apos;ll get there .
you just worry about
being strapped in a giant metal tube
30,000 feet in the air .
that &apos;s right -- i heard .
hey .
what ?
i just thought of something .
what &apos;s going on with my hair today ?
daddy &apos;s going to do it up really pretty with flowers .
not you , right ?
no , other daddy .
oh , thank god .
mitchell , this is not my tuxedo !
they gave me the wrong order !
and the fuchsia gown didn &apos;t tip you off ?
i have like nine shirts this color .
i &apos;m wearing a shirt this color .
okay , deep breaths . deep breaths .
we have plenty of time to go to the dry @-@ cleaner .
we knew that there would be a bump today ,
and here it is . we &apos;re getting it done early .
this is our bump .
每周七天开放
暂停营业
okay , okay , so this is our bump .
i can &apos;t handle this .
we &apos;re getting married in five hours ,
i don &apos;t have my perfectly tailored tux .
i can &apos;t just go buy something off the rack .
i &apos;m not cindy crawford .
why a woman ?
i &apos;m just wondering .
what are we gonna do ?
we could eat .
we just need to get in touch with the owner .
y @-@ you , uh , you know his name , right ?
it &apos;s ... aziz something ? .
oh , oh it &apos;s -- it &apos;s -- uh , no , it &apos;s a @-@ amir .
it &apos;s -- it &apos;s not amir , no .
oh , no , it &apos;s , uh , ahmad .
it &apos;s achmed .
no . oh , it &apos;s on the ticket .
now i &apos;m just feeling racist .
what is it ?
here it is .
it &apos;s ...
jerry .
j-- oh , jerry .
amari .
jerry amari .
there you go .
can you see better in here ?
a little , but those drops are really hanging on .
i &apos;m like han solo right when he came out of the carbonite .
really ? nothing ?
i get it . it &apos;s &quot; star trek . &quot;
you &apos;re breaking my heart .
save it for luke . he &apos;ll love that .
can we just get the gift and get out of here ?
right , but first things first .
let &apos;s put on some funny hats ,
act like they &apos;re not there ,
and then walk around all serious .
what &apos;s the point of this ?
that &apos;s good . you &apos;re nailing it .
hey , honey .
how was the eye exam ?
great .
i can barely see .
i &apos;m wearing giant sunglasses and a girly hat .
alex and i are having a blast .
but you got the gift , right ?
that &apos;s what people tell me .
honey , the bowl .
i have the bowl .
it &apos;s beautiful .
i &apos;ll -- i &apos;ll see you at home .
hey , here &apos;s a thought --
now that you told mom you got the bowl ,
how about we actually go get it ?
yes , no more fooling around .
let &apos;s go get the bowl .
oh , right after we find out our sleep number .
there &apos;s my guy .
i thought dad was picking me up .
oh . i missed you , too .
come here .
so , did you have fun ?
yeah .
what was your favorite thing ?
i don &apos;t remember .
it was yesterday .
hot dogs . can we go now ?
honey , i feel bad that you have to leave early .
what are you missing today ?
boating .
well , i mean , we have a little time .
you don &apos;t mind waiting in the car ?
so , cam tells me you and mitch had a little dust @-@ up .
yeah .
a couple of weeks ago .
that kid can hold a grudge .
a little uncomfortable about that wedding , are you ?
well , you know what i &apos;m feeling , right ?
i &apos;d like to think i &apos;ve evolved on the subject .
we got a couple of lesbo swans in the pond .
they seem pretty happy .
hey , jay .
hey , howard , larry .
this is my , uh ...
this is my friend merle , and he &apos;s visiting from missouri .
ooh , the &quot; show me &quot; state .
don &apos;t say that in here !
so , what brings you to town , merle ?
well , uh , my -- our --
jay &apos;s and my ... kids are getting married today .
congratulations .
isn &apos;t that nice ?
father of the bride , father of the groom
taking a steam together the day of the wedding .
yeah , something like that .
the day my son got married -- piece of cake .
but the day i lost my little girl --
ohh , that wrecked me .
so , which one of you has to suffer through that today ?
you know what ? it &apos;s too hot in here .
yeah .
let &apos;s go .
mm @-@ hmm . real evolved .
your swans would be ashamed .
well , i guess i first noticed it after pameron moved out ,
and merle and i just started
sniping at each other .
yeah , like that bloodbath this morning ?
ohh . again , i am so sorry .
but merle is not the type you can talk to about things .
i mean , the man &apos;s had a toothpick in his mouth
our whole marriage , and i can &apos;t say a word .
no , you can &apos;t sit on your feelings .
you will explode !
i have , like , 10 little explosions every day ,
so i don &apos;t have the big one .
the women in my family --
sometimes , they shoot their husbands .
well , we &apos;ve had 48 ... good years .
i ... guess we &apos;re just gonna run out the clock .
no !
you &apos;re still ...
you have ...
that is bad attitude !
you have to tell merle what is bothering you .
oh , he doesn &apos;t want to hear all that .
he gets all closed off and macho .
you &apos;re ticklin &apos; my piggies .
you get used to that .
it &apos;s a shame mitchell &apos;s mother couldn &apos;t make it to the wedding .
for who ?
mm , things still rough between the two of you ?
merle , things have always been rough .
that woman never stopped complaining .
finding the strength to leave dede is the hardest thing i ever did ,
but the best decision i ever made .
well , you sure made a score with that gloria .
big @-@ time .
i bet you landed her
before she got a gander at those hooves of yours .
you &apos;re welcome , by the way .
so , what are you gonna do in utah ?
well , me and my girlfriend
haven &apos;t seen each other in a while ,
so we &apos;re gonna be like a couple of bunny rabbits ...
just hopping all over town .
is this her ?
yep , that &apos;s my beth .
huh . she &apos;s pretty .
yeah . she &apos;s the most beautiful creature , inside and out .
i &apos;m just the luckiest guy ever to get to love her .
okay , she may be real ,
but no way you are .
who talks like that ?
you know , i hate when you say things like that
because you are funny , and you are pretty ,
and you are smart and in an original way ,
so why shouldn &apos;t a guy feel lucky to love you ?
shut up . be normal .
hey , my phone just buzzed . can you read it ?
yeah .
i don &apos;t want to put our lives at risk .
it &apos;s , uh , it &apos;s from the airline .
your flight &apos;s delayed three hours .
three hours ? !
yeah .
ohh ! jinkies !
i guess we can just drop me off at a coffee shop ,
and i can take a cab from there .
okay .
actually , i really need to wake up .
maybe i &apos;ll grab a coffee with you , if you don &apos;t mind .
please .
the more i talk to people ,
the less i imagine plummeting to my death
in a fiery spiral of screaming and crying .
pretty dark for someone who just said &quot; jinkies . &quot;
well , i guess we have
different definitions of &quot; emergency , &quot; then .
you know , i &apos;m just gonna say it --
911 dispatchers have a little bit of attitude .
well , you requested a s.w.a.t. team .
is anybody else hungry ?
mitchell ! mitchell !
look at this .
do you think you could fit in there ?
i &apos;m not doing that .
then what am i gonna wear to our wedding --
my black funeral suit ?
is that the tone you want to set ?
you wore it to one funeral .
and you didn &apos;t even know bea arthur .
i felt like i did .
i know .
it &apos;s pepper . he &apos;ll know what to do .
yes . pepper . disaster .
it &apos;s not a disaster . it &apos;s just a wildfire .
and it &apos;s most certainly not going to burn down your wedding .
what ? !
what ?
there &apos;s a wildfire near the venue .
no !
yes , but it &apos;s fine .
ronaldo is going to text @-@ blast the guest list ,
tell them the wedding is being moved from 5 : 00 to 1 : 00 .
oh , my god !
don &apos;t panic .
would somebody please turn off that wretched waterfall ? !
kill the waterfall immediately !
the fire is already 28 % contained .
that doesn &apos;t sound like a lot .
just get dressed and look pretty .
i &apos;m going to send the car for you in one hour .
have you lost your mind ? !
go ! you disgust me !
go !
okay .
now what are we gonna do ?
no , i guess maybe --
no , th-- cam , there &apos;s no way i could fit through there .
you two exhaust me .
what ?
we have to be there in an hour !
i can &apos;t go like this !
look at me !
i hate you .
prepare yourself for the best burger of your life .
we got to go .
maybe we should try on more hats .
do you think we have time ?
it &apos;s not working !
and there &apos;s no oar ?
we are literally up a creek without a paddle ?
okay , lily , lily !
okay , you &apos;re gonna press the green button to start it ,
and then you &apos;re gonna look for number 9 @-@ 1 @-@ 3 .
and then , when you see it go by ,
you press the red button to stop it , okay ?
okay .
oh , i &apos;m so glad you &apos;re here .
i get us into these situations , and i freak ,
and then you always fix the problem .
well , now , we each have our own gifts .
it &apos;s just it &apos;s easier for me
to stay calm in the face of --
oh , my god ! oh , my god ! oh , oh !
lily , daddies coming for you !
oh , my god !
okay , now , lily , press the red button !
i &apos;m breaking the window !
put that down !
thank god you &apos;re here .
are you breaking into my store ?
uh , no .
why would you even say that ?
my alarm went off .
oh , well , okay , that is a coincidence
because his tuxedo is in there ,
and we &apos;re getting married in an hour .
you are totally saving us .
you know , i freak out at situations like this ,
which forces him to fix the problem ,
you know ?
i do . i do .
so , i &apos;m over here , freaking out ,
while he &apos;s somewhere else , fixing the problem .
oh , my gosh . i &apos;m so sorry .
well , maybe that &apos;s a good thing , you know --
the yin , the yang ?
yeah , whatever , jerry .
where &apos;d she come from ?
oh , oh , because she doesn &apos;t look like us ?
that &apos;s offensive .
oh , jerry .
what are we going to do ?
i know how to get up there .
i &apos;m blind .
follow me .
oh , i &apos;m not doing that .
alex !
excuse me , could someone help me to find the back of the line ?
oh , no , no . it &apos;s okay .
go right here .
are you sure ?
can i help you ?
yes , picking up for dunphy .
it &apos;s on hold , i believe .
beautiful day , huh ? i was told .
here we go . credit card ?
uh , just to be sure -- that is turquoise , right ?
because my wife said it also comes in emerald .
yes . sir , it &apos;s a very long line .
okay . um , can i have it for one second ?
thank you .
yep , that doesn &apos;t feel like turquoise .
you can feel color ? you got to be kidding me .
when you lose one sense ,
all your other senses become heightened .
that &apos;s why you sound so loud and judge @-@ y to me .
my mistake , sir .
i &apos;ll be right back .
okay .
here it is .
hey , he &apos;s messing with the blind guy .
thank you -- wherever you are .
i don &apos;t think he &apos;s really blind .
excuse me .
my father suffered methanol poisoning
on a humanitarian mission in honduras
resulting in permanent neurological dysfunction
and irreversible blindness .
it &apos;s been hard enough on our family
without people like you making it worse .
if he feels it &apos;s not the bowl ,
it &apos;s not the bowl .
i &apos;m so sorry .
i &apos;ll check on the turquoise .
okay , that was kind of fun .
i &apos;m winking at you right now .
ohh , this is not working .
we are never gonna get there on time ,
and i am the best person .
oh , god !
i think i just broke a nail on a turtle .
you &apos;re the one who wanted to come out here .
yes , i did ,
because i wanted to spend some time with my son .
you &apos;ve --
you &apos;ve been pushing me away so much lately ,
and i don &apos;t want you to grow up to be the kind of kid
who doesn &apos;t care if his mom shows up at his wedding .
what are you talking about ?
nana isn &apos;t coming today , and mitchell &apos;s relieved .
i &apos;d be really sad if you missed my wedding .
really ? you promise ?
totally . and so would kate .
who &apos;s kate ?
upton -- my wife , your daughter @-@ in @-@ law .
get on board .
come on .
then what has been going on with you recently ?
you &apos;ve been so moody .
i &apos;m sorry , but i &apos;m sick of going school
and hearing teachers say ,
&quot; you &apos;re alex dunphy &apos;s brother ?
really ? &quot; like i &apos;m an idiot .
oh , honey , you &apos;re not an idiot .
i forgot the paddle
even though we just learned the boating checklist yesterday .
alex would never do that .
and if she did , she &apos;d probably , like --
i don &apos;t know --
use this fishing rod to cast out and hook us on the shore
because &quot; i &apos;m so smart . &quot;
and then she &apos;d pull us in
because everything she does always works .
oh , my god . it &apos;s working . it &apos;s working !
figures . alex .
don &apos;t move .
the lighting is really cool right now .
wh are you doing ? don &apos;t smile .
why ? it &apos;s my favorite thing .
no , really , be serious .
look out the window .
look .
that is honestly the best photo anyone &apos;s ever taken of me .
thank you .
you mind if i send a copy to beth ?
andy , um ...
when i read the text about your flight ,
i saw the text from beth telling you not to come .
yeah , she doesn &apos;t mean that .
she said , &quot; it &apos;s over . &quot;
that can mean a lot of different things .
your phone &apos;s buzzing again .
oh , my god . the wedding got moved up .
i have to go .
andy , are you sure about getting on that plane ?
yeah , yeah . i @-@ i &apos;m fine .
you know , she does this every once in a while .
she just likes the drama .
but i -- okay . - haley ,
i appreciate your concern -- i really do --
but i &apos;ve been in this relationship off and on for eight years ,
so i kind of know what i &apos;m doing , all right ?
thank you for the ride .
it &apos;s a tool of the trade .
the car one says &quot; toyota . &quot;
i have eyes on the grooms .
i &apos;m three feet behind you .
how &apos;s it going ? are people showing up ?
it &apos;s all under control .
surprise ! guess who &apos;s on time .
oh , my god !
sal , wow , you &apos;re pregnant .
congratulations !
thank you . we &apos;re really excited .
you &apos;re huge .
nice teeth .
uh , so , w @-@ where &apos;s tony ?
oh , beats me .
haven &apos;t spoken to him since the divorce .
yeah , it &apos;s , uh , eddie . eddie ! baby !
come here ! come meet the girls !
eddie .
this is eddie .
eddie .
cam , mitch , peps , this guy .
this is eddie , my baby daddy .
so , why didn &apos;t you tell us ?
oh , you know ,
we just wanted to get through that first trimester
before we let the cat out of the bag .
when was that -- last summer ?
so , y @-@ you &apos;re -- you &apos;re how far along now ?
about four months . right , honey ?
just about the exact amount of time eddie and i have been together .
i don &apos;t understand .
four is this many , yes ?
si ?
hola , handsome boys .
you two look gorgeous .
gracias .
oh , thank you .
pretty nice , huh ? like a regular wedding .
good start , jay .
hey , merle , it &apos;s your son &apos;s wedding --
maybe lose the toothpick ?
i &apos;m getting tired of this nagging .
i &apos;m leaving you .
what ?
not if i leave you first !
no , no , no , you don &apos;t mean this !
oh , don &apos;t you feel bad , honey .
you have helped me today .
thanks for getting me over the hump .
what did you do ?
wow . we &apos;re doing this
are you ready ?
i don &apos;t want to wait another minute .
lily , hit it .
on 3 , boys .
1 , 2 --
attention ! attention , please !
the fire has jumped the freeway .
i &apos;m really sorry , folks .
i &apos;m gonna have to evacuate everyone immediately .
so , this our bump .
