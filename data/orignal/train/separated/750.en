What is that?
What're you doing?
Oh, my godness.
Oh, hey guys, you have any hair you want removed?
Hey.
I must respectfully decline such a horribly depressing invitation.
Going on a date with Elizabeth tonight.
I haven't had sex with her since I was fat and accessing my penis
was like getting the remote control out of the couch.
Now I know things,
and I own things.
Like this.
What is that?
Oh, my God, that poor girl.
This is the Archduke.
The crowning achievement
of the German Institute of Female Pleasure.
Dude, this thing takes 16 single-A batteries?
I thought I threw that thing out the window.
That only made it stronger.
Oh, that reminds me:
Daisy called, and we're going out tonight.
Yeah, she sounded pretty excited.
I do believe her exact words were,
"This is your last chance."
So, I'm very confident.
Yeah.
Very confident.
Schmidt, can you help me
with my phone? I have...
Oh, you need help? Where's your women's lib now?
From Teddy:
"In town tonight."
"Would love to see you."
"9 p.m. Drinks?"
Oh, my God, Teddy.
Hey, who's Teddy?
Whoa, hey, man. What are you doing...?
Nick?
Weird and gross.
Sometimes I just sit in the stall
and listen to you guys.
Who's Teddy?
Makes sense.
What do you think he wants? You think I should
meet him for a drink?
Am I the only one
kind of dying to know
who this Teddy character is?
I think I speak for all of us...
Nick, you and Jess
didn't work out, okay?
No...
Yeah, "Ww"-- It's not about that, just...
Chill out.
Yeah, no. Thanks.
Fine. Look.
I already regret this.
Teddy... Teddy took my flower.
Wow, yeah, he did.
Yeah, he stole a flower from you?
And you want to have drinks with him?
Oh, from your wonderful secret garden.
Oh, my God.
You guys
do have to hear this story, though.
'Cause it is the worst.
No, no.
It's the worst! It's the worst.
They...
I guarantee you it's not any more embarrassing
than the story of me losing my virginity.
I promise you mine's worse than all of yours.
Prom night. 2000.
What was the theme?
Yeah, who cares about the theme?
What were you wearing?
I want to know the theme.
第二季 第二十三集
It was after prom. Cece and I were both 18,
and we'd rented a hotel room.
So... would you like to freak?
Yes, I would.
So
And I thought what I felt was simple...
I'm gonna freak you toward the bed.
Do I have your permission?
Yes, you do.
And now that I am leaving
Now I know that I...
So, he and I were the founding members
of the Gender Equality Society.
Also, the only members of the Gender Equality Society.
We both asked each other to the prom
in the spirit of gender equality,
and we both said yes.
Okay, get to it.
No one cares.
Oregon sucks.
I'm gonna take off your dress.
Do I have your permission?
Yup. Yup. Okay.
I only hear what I want to
I can't find the zipper.
Oh, there is no zipper.
Um, I made this dress,
and my mom sewed me in, so...
Um, maybe I can try in the abdominal area here?
Is that okay?
Yes. You have my permission.
Unwind the...
Maybe if, um... you know,
um, 'cause maybe you could just rip it.
I turn the radio up...
I... I just want to make sure you're feeling safe...
No, no, no. I-I feel, like, so safe,
and, like, I've never felt, like, more safe.
Well, do I have your permission...
Just be a man and rip it off...
When we weep for the other
Who was dying since the day they were born
Well, well...
Now I'm feeling very unsafe.
But I'm thrown
And I thought I'd live forever...
I think, um, I'm gonna go,
um, get... like, I'll see if the front desk
has a seam ripper.
Yeah.
Come on, Jess.
Get to the sex part.
If this is another story
about sewing, I swear to God...
Please. I'm getting there.
You okay?
Yeah.
Oh, man.
He wore the hell out of those tuxedo pants.
People have told me I look really good in tuxedos, so...
I don't think I've ever seen you in a tux.
I've worn a tuxedo.
Everybody has tuxedos.
Tuxedo is different than a suit.
It is?
Wait, didn't he have a guitar?
Oh, my God, yes. Best part.
And now that I am leaving
I know that I did something wrong
Cause I missed you
Yeah, yeah
Cause I missed you.
Lame.
Man...
Prom is so stupid, right?
Yeah, and, like,
what is "Prom" short for?
I think it's actually "Promenade."
So, you want a man? You want a... want a man?
Okay, there are no scissors in there,
so I taped these two steak knives together.
Now, do I have your permission to just...
Oh, my God.
Uh, I have...
to deal with this...
So, you mean to tell me you didn't
lose your virginity at prom?
Technically, no.
Technically?
Technically,
why did we listen to that
whole story, then?
Technically, this guy's the worst.
Playing guitar for girls.
Girls don't like that. That's a fact.
It's okay, man.
What's okay?
I wasn't done yet, guys.
I was in the prologue.
David Foster Wallace, where is the sex?
You're in last place.
Cece, please go. Tell your story
of how your lost your virginity. I need a palate cleanse.
Actually, it was the same night.
It was prom night?
Really?
Who was it with?
Study Hall Steve or Cool Car Johnny?
Not them.
So what? I'm a virgin.
I don't want to plan it out.
Whatever happens, happens.
Oh, hello.
I'd like to make love to you.
That's Mick Jagger.
What?! Whoa!
Game changer!
Freaking...
Beatlemania! Beatlemania!
Keep it together, Schmidt.
Oh, my... The Beatles?!
He was just on tour in Portland,
and we just started talking,
and then we started laughing...
What... but I'm confused.
Uh, Cece, that is not an embarrassing story.
Yeah, I know.
But I just love telling it.
Yeah.
Cece, you officially move into last place.
Boom. Moving up, worst story.
Jess, you have no chance of winning.
It was my junior year of college.
I was about 200 pounds heavier.
Freshman 50 plus sophomore 50
plus junior 100.
I got some lubricant.
It's to use on a woman.
Uh... to increase her pleasure.
Hey, is it chill that I have the room later?
Elizabeth and I have been talking, and...
we plan on merging tonight.
Yeah, Schmidt!
Penis, vagina. Penis, vagina.
The room's all yours, cowboy.
Yeah, I got some, uh, mushrooms,
and I'm going to a Dave Matthews concert later.
I've a Daver.
That sucks!
White people.
Is this the first time you'll be making... full love?
No way, Jose.
Nick... back in high school,
they used to call me...
the Sex... the Sex Hammer.
That's a great nickname.- But, you know,
now that we're sitting here talking,
would you mind having a discussion, uh, openly
about the subject of intercourse?
Shoot.
Cool.
Hey, does it hurt for the guys?
Not one bit.
If I pee while it's happening, will she die?
How many minutes before sex is it... is it okay to eat?
I don't think it's an exact science.
I think it depends on your frame.
So, I should eat right before.
In terms of lubricant,
do I put a small amount everywhere
or do I use a large amount in a small...
in a smaller area?
You're harshing my vibe, Schmidt.
You're the coolest, Nick.
You know, so I'd already taken the mushrooms.
Obviously.
And I was ready
to go to the concert,
when I realized that
the troll at the end of my bed
was pretty upset about it.
I don't want any trouble.
I think you're a remarkable creature.
No.
Oh... I feel hot in my pants.
I still don't understand why you didn't just leave.
I've told you a million times,
my arm was a magnet
and the walls were magnetic.
What about that do you not understand?
That's a real big jar of lube, man.
Wait, why are you rubbing it on your leg?
No, that's my arm.
Aah! Eyes, eyes, eyes!
Oh, stop moving so much. You're too slippery.
Oh, this lube is so slippery.
Schmidt, where are you? I can't see.
Sex.
I-I think there's enough lube.
I think we can do it now.
You definitely shouldn't
be going to get more.
Schmidt?
Be right there.
I think we overdid it.
I can't see!
I'm right here... No!
Schmidt, I want to make love!
I got to go.
It's sex.
I'm coming, Elizabeth!
Look, when we were dating,
I was very limited as to what we could do sexually.
It wasn't until the Iraqi war
that I realized a guy could even be on top.
But that's all different now.
Now I have the Archduke.
Schmidt, have you ever considered not using lube
and some giant sex toy,
and just being with her?
Plain Jane-ing it? Yeah, okay.
Well, I know for a fact that I can't win this thing,
because my story was...
beautiful.
No, your story was not beautiful.
Nick's dad took us on a business trip to New York, right?
And he said that we could do whatever we wanted.
And we did.
Oh, man.
They're all on the Titanic.
How does this movie end?
I can't believe I never seen it before, man.
It's the best.
You're mom's the best...
at having boobs.
Shut up, stupid.
I'm just kidding, man.
Don't. Don't.
I didn't bring you two dummies all the way to New York
so you can park your cans on the couch, watch TV
and flick each other's Bics.
Hey, Dad, last night, somebody broke in
and ordered a pornographic movie,
so there's a mistake on the bill.
Yeah, okay, you can tell that to the Marines.
Meanwhile... I have a little surprise for you boys.
Oh, cool.
Ladies?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.
Wait, what? You lost your virginity to prostitutes?
No, they were businesswomen.
Who could dance sexy.
Winston, 100% they were prostitutes.
Dude, no.
Ladies, ladies, ladies.
We work in the finance markets.
We work in the finance markets?
I'm Mysteria. This is Octopussy.
Your name's Octopussy?
Absolutely.
Thank you, guys, for coming.
We're very wealthy.
Winston, listen to their names.
They sound like pros.
She was a nurse.
Dude, her nurse hat was in her purse.
Would you listen to yourself?!
Honey, why are you sweating so much?
You should drink something.
Thank you for the offer, Ms. Octopussy,
but I-I don't drink. I prefer to be drunk on life.
Hold that for me?
Sure.
Thank you.
Perhaps I'll try some.
So she told me to come over and I took that trip
And then she pulled out...
Very interesting.
I'm gonna do it to you.
You're gonna do what to me?
I don't know.
Are you crying?
Please, excuse me,
but I had to lay off a lot of really good men today at work.
What's wrong with your friend?
He's a virgin.
Aren't you a virgin, too?
Just my penis, baby.
Just my penis.
So Mysteria and I made love that night.
For ten beautiful seconds.
So, what do you do for a living?
And it was good.
Nick, I can't believe yolost your virginity to Octopussy.
I couldn't go through with it.
It's 'cause the boy had no game.
He couldn't close.
Okay, you don't need game.
They were prostitutes. My dad told me.
Pop-Pop told you? When?
Nicky, you here?
Yeah, I'm here, Dad.
What are you doing?
If I'm being totally honest,
I've had some alcoholic beverages tonight.
Well, to be totally honest with you, so have I.
How do you think I got through Annie?
Geez, that was rough.
What happened here?
I'm sorry, Dad.
I couldn't make love to Ms. Octopussy tonight.
It's too dangerous,
and I was afraid the FBI was gonna track me down
or a paper trail.
You think too much. You think too much about everything.
When I was your age,
my dad got a girl for me, too.
I mean, this is almost a Miller family tradition.
You should have seen her boobs.
They were great.
Real pointy, just like I like 'em.
Gross.
Listen, Nicky,
you don't have to do anything that you don't want to do.
I just want to make sure
that you don't miss out on the things in life
that are happening when you're not thinking.
Because, believe in me,
those are the best things in life.
I think I really like drinking.
Well, that's great. That's wonderful. That's good.
That's a great start.
It's really fun.
It makes me feel good.
Good.
Don't tell Winston about the girls.
You know, that they're... pros.
Yeah, I won't.
I don't want to break his heart, you know?
Okay.
I mean, you can tell him, but just... wait, you know?
Maybe after I'm gone.
I'll tell him when you're dead.
So it's time you should know.
Mysteria...
On the bright side,
looks like you won the contest.
Actually...
Jess, look at him. Let him have this.
Yeah, I'm sorry, Winston. I just can't let you win this.
My story... involves...
murder.
Was Mysteria even her real name?
No.
So, I'd just moved to L.A. to be with Cece
and we went out to some bar.
Do you remember where that was?
No.
How did I get this far without having sex?
In three years, I'm gonna be 25.
I can't rent my first car as a virgin.
They'll know.
Okay. What about those guys over there?
Mega beer! Party!
Pour beer at the same time.
They are definitely single.
I mean, kill me.
Oh, my God.
It was the guy from prom night.
It was fate.
Want to get out of here?
Like, to do it?
Yeah. I'd be down with that.
Yes.
But I'm kind of living out of my car right now.
Damn it.
Yeah.
And I'm sleeping on my friend's couch.
Do you like DVDs?
Do you sell cookies?
Not a cookie bar.
I have an idea.
Hey, uh, I'm kind of on a lot of antidepressants right now,
so this may kind of take a while.
The only antidepressants you need are in my pants.
Uh, it's really a medical issue.
I'm so sorry. That was really uncool.
And... take as much time as you need.
So, two hours later... still nothing.
It was like a wind sock on a windless day.
Give me an update, brother. How's your wang?
Do you have, like, an...
Is there, like, an angle you could...
Like... I mean...
It's just... it's so much easier when it's, like, in the shower,
you know, and you're by
yourself and you don't...
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
Well, what can I do to help? Listen,
why don't we try our luck on the other side of the castle, okay?
Oh, my God!
We're stuck.
Hey, uh, don't really know why, but...
ready now.
Okay, we were promised murder.
She's not done.
Hey...
hey, kids. Could one of you go get a grown-up?
We're doing some grown-up things over here.
Happy birth...
Happy birthday.
Sir, um, we tried to make love
on the bench, but, uh, there was a man there.
Oh, he's still there. He must have been very tired.
He slept through all those sirens.
This man's dead.
What?!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
I'm stuck!
Officer, I... it was very dark,
and I did not see the knife.
There's so much death in the world.
Seriously, dude, take your pills! I'm sick of you.
I'm sick of you!
I'm sick of you!
Important reminder...
don't move.
I think I might be gay!
Yeah.
Oh, my God.
Teddy's gay? I knew it. Yes.
That wasn't Teddy.
That was Teddy.
What?
I'm Teddy.
Teddy Sherman.
Take me home, Teddy.
Take me home.
I'm sick of firemen always winning.
Well, you know, I'd just waited so long,
and Teddy took me by surprise.
It was the heat of the moment.
I didn't have to think about it.
Well, who wins? I-I need a winner.
I think we're all losers.
Are you kidding me, Jess?
You had passionate sex with a fireman, all right?
I had sex with a hooker.
Well, I mean, unless...
Are you guys sure she was a hooker?
Jess, wait.
So, is he, like, the kind
of fireman that hangs back and takes care of the dog?
No, he, like, straight up fought fires.
That's awful to hear.
You know,
you never actually told me how you lost yours.
Alison Daniels.
On a towel in the woods.
I cried.
She kept her bra on.
It was nice.
I have to go meet Teddy.
I should go.
What do you think?
What are you doing?
Let's not think about it.
I've got three hours till the red-eye.
Let's do this.
Babe, you know I don't do well under pressure.
Well, just distract yourself. Um...
here, turn on the TV.
Look, we're gonna be married in, like, two days.
Should we maybe, you know, try it once?
Not yet.
What is that?
It's a super intense German personal power massager.
But I don't think we need it.
Hey. You know...
since you...
came all this way with that box...
We'll have to take the batteries out of the smoke detector.
