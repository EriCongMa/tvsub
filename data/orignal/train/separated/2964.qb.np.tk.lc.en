hey , you guys . \ nhey , what are you doing ?
figuring out our wedding plans . \ n- funny . we were doing the same thing .
it &apos;s really crazy . \ nthe hall , the dress , the food .
i had no idea how expensive this was . \ n- yeah , it is really pricey .
i freaked when i heard the numbers . \ n- so , what did you two do about it ?
it was simple . i came up with \ nsome cost @-@ cutting solutions ..
wrote out a list , \ nand monica told me to go to hell .
there &apos;s no way around it . just accept \ nthat this is gonna cost a lot of money .
i heard that weddings are , like , \ na $ 40 billion @-@ a @-@ year industry .
yeah . and i &apos;m responsible \ nfor just , like , half of that .
i don &apos;t know . it &apos;s a lot of money \ nto spend on one day .
hey , i &apos;ve been married before , \ ni don &apos;t need a big wedding .
all i ask is that you don &apos;t do ecstasy \ nand make out with my brother .
but really , it does seem like \ nthis money could be put to better use .
hey , you could buy a ton \ nof amway products .
or give it all to charity . \ n- oh , that &apos;s great .
how am i gonna unload \ nall those amway products ?
are you serious ?
yeah . how would you feel if we gave \ nall the wedding money to charity ..
and we just got married at city hall ?
i think it would make me \ nwanna marry you even more .
i gotta say , you guys , \ nthat &apos;s an incredible gesture .
maybe you do that \ nnext time you get married .
no , no , no . the next time &apos;s \ ngonna be hawaii at sunset .
but maybe the time after that .

hey . what &apos;s going on ? \ n- hey .
our adoption social worker is coming , \ nso we &apos;re cleaning the apartment .
&quot; we &quot; ?
you know you don &apos;t want me to help . \ nyou can &apos;t have it both ways .
is this the person who decides \ nwhether or not you get a baby ?
she &apos;s coming to see where we live . \ n- and it has to go perfectly .
if she doesn &apos;t like us , she can keep \ nus off every adoption list in the state .
hey , maybe i should stop by . \ nshe could be a soap opera fan .
it &apos;s very impressive when \ nthe little people know a celebrity .
&quot; little people &quot; ?
&quot; celebrity . &quot;
so i think i &apos;m just about done here .
unless you have any bad stuff hidden \ nsomewhere , like porn or cigarettes ?
what ?
no . \ n- chandler .
i don &apos;t , and i &apos;m offended \ nby the insinuation .
so there &apos;s not a magazine \ nunder the couch ..
or cigarettes taped to the back \ nof the toilet tank ..
or a filthy video in the vcr ?
i &apos;ll admit to the cigarettes and magazine . \ nbut that tape is not mine .
it isn &apos;t mine . \ n- i guess we &apos;ll never know whose it is .
may i help you ?
yes . we &apos;re here to make a rather \ nsizable donation to the children .
any contribution , large or small , \ nis appreciated .
i think you &apos;re gonna appreciate \ nthe crap out of this one .
well , this is very generous . \ n- and we don &apos;t want any recognition .
this is completely anonymous .
completely anonymous . \ nfrom two kind strangers .
mr. x and phoebe buffay .
we can put your names \ nin our newsletter .
not necessary . \ n- buffay is spelled b @-@ u @-@ f @-@ f @-@ a @-@ y.
and x is spelled &quot; mike hannigan . &quot;
possible headline : \ nattractive couple makes world better .
well , on behalf of the children , \ nthank you both very much .
i &apos;m glad we did this . it feels so good . \ n- it does . it feels really good .
oh , look . and we get these free t @-@ shirts .
actually , that &apos;s the shirt \ ni wore to the gym .
it &apos;s moist .
hi . emma will be up in a minute . \ n- oh , good .
hey , ross , listen . i heard about \ nyou and charlie . i &apos;m really sorry .
that &apos;s okay . i &apos;m sure there are tons of \ nother beautiful paleontologists out there .
absolutely . \ n- there was one . she &apos;s it .
all the rest look like \ nthey should live under a bridge .
so , what are you gonna do today ?
i was thinking of taking emma \ nto the playground .
oh , my god . what ?
like i said , i was thinking of taking \ nemma to the museum of knives and fire .
okay , look , ross . i do not want \ nemma going to the playground .
because .. ?
all right , if you must know , \ ni had a traumatic ..
swing incident when i was little .
seriously ? \ n- yes . i was 4 years old .
and i was on the swing ..
and then all of a sudden my hair \ ngot tangled in the chain .
and to get me out , my mom had \ nto cut a big chunk of my hair .
and it was uneven for weeks .
and you made it through that ?
i wonder who &apos;s gonna play you \ nin the movie .
okay , fine , you can make fun of me . \ ni do not want emma going there .
and i was thinking claire danes .
look , i &apos;m sorry to hear \ nabout your tragedy .
but the swings are perfectly safe . \ nand besides , emma loves them .
you should come , and you &apos;ll see . \ n- those things go , like , 40 miles an hour .
and there &apos;s that moment \ nwhen you &apos;re at the top ..
when you just don &apos;t know \ nif you &apos;re gonna return back to earth .
space is filled with orbiting children .
look , please , just come on .
when you see the look on emma &apos;s face , \ ni swear , you won &apos;t regret it .
all right . \ n- good .
you don &apos;t wanna be a mom who passes \ nher irrational fears to her children .
&quot; irrational , &quot; huh ?
i &apos;ll remember that next time you freak \ nout about a spider in your apartment .
that &apos;s the same . i &apos;m sure there are 30 \ ndifferent species of poisonous swings .
oh , my god . \ nthe adoption lady is early .
okay . okay . here we go . \ nhere we go .
stand up straight .
big smile .
hello . is this the creepy residence ?
we &apos;re waiting for the adoption lady . \ nbut i &apos;m glad you &apos;re here .
i was cleaning this morning \ nand i found this .
i don &apos;t know \ nif you wanna use it , but ..
oh , this is so sweet of you .
but i won &apos;t be needing a veil . \ ni actually won &apos;t be wearing a dress at all .
i told you , i am not coming \ nto a naked wedding !
no . we &apos;re not having a big reception .
we took the wedding money \ nand donated it to a children &apos;s charity .
that &apos;s crazy !
generous . \ n- crazy generous .
i &apos;m sorry . i can &apos;t imagine giving up \ nmy one wedding day like that .
well , we &apos;re different . \ ni don &apos;t care about having a huge party .
this is really nice for you , but ..
oh , please . i put this on \ nand i just look like ..
well , radiant .
all right , but who cares ? i don &apos;t need \ na pretty veil and a fancy dress .
that &apos;s right . \ nyou &apos;re making a commitment .
you know , that &apos;s the same \ nwhether you do it at the plaza or ..
where you gonna do it ? \ n- city hall .
oh , that sounds nice .
i was just there for jury duty . \ nthey &apos;ve really spruced that place up .
okay . it &apos;s okay . it &apos;s okay . it &apos;s okay . \ ni &apos;ve made my decision .
what i really want \ nis a great big wedding .
but you gave all the money to charity . \ n- well , i &apos;ll just ask for it back .
i don &apos;t think you can do that . \ n- why not ?
this is her wedding day . that &apos;s way \ nmore important than some stupid kids .
that &apos;s sweet , honey , but save \ nsomething for the adoption lady .
all right , okay . be careful . \ n- okay .
careful . watch her hair . \ nwatch her hair !
rach , she &apos;s got , like , three hairs . \ n- i know . i know .
but they &apos;re just so beautiful . \ noh , my god , i just pulled one out .
i promise you she &apos;s safe . \ nwatch how much she loves this .
okay . okay . \ n- are you ready , sweetie ? here we go .
okay , careful . okay .
she &apos;s smiling .
look at that , she does like it .
see , i told you .
oh , my god . look at her , \ nshe &apos;s a little daredevil .
oh , god . let me push . can i push ? \ n- oh , absolutely .
oh , god . okay , get the camera . \ nit &apos;s in the diaper bag .
okay .
see ? scared of the swings . \ ni bet you feel pretty silly .
we &apos;re asking for the money back ? \ n- it &apos;s for our wedding day .
now , is this guy gay or straight ? \ nbecause one of us has to start flirting .
you here to make another \ ndonation the same day ?
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s ever \ nhappened before .
gay . go .
oh , my god , i love your shirt .
the donation we made earlier ? \ nwell , we want it back .
excuse me ?
okay , that money was for a big wedding \ nwe thought we didn &apos;t want .
but it turns out we do .
so you &apos;re asking us to refund \ nyour donation to the children ?
yeah .
this feels really good .
i &apos;m sorry . i am . but this wedding &apos;s \ njust really important to me .
hey , it &apos;s none of my business . \ nbesides , this is probably a good thing .
we &apos;ve really been spoiling the children , \ nwhat with all the food and warm clothing .
that &apos;s not fair . \ na person &apos;s wedding is important .
and especially to me .
i didn &apos;t have a graduation party . \ nand i didn &apos;t go to prom .
and i spent my sweet 16 \ nbeing chased around a tire yard ..
by an escaped mental patient who , \ nin his own words , wanted to :
&quot; kill me , or whatever . &quot;
so i deserve a real celebration .
and i &apos;m not gonna let some sweaty \ nlittle man make me feel badly about it .
she could &apos;ve been talking about \ neither one of us .
okay . here we go .
good luck .
tongue , really ?
hi , i &apos;m laura . i &apos;m here \ nfor your adoption interview .
hi , i &apos;m monica . \ nand this is chandler .
please come in . \ n- thank you .
would you like something to drink ? \ n- water would be fine .
we &apos;re so glad that you &apos;re here .
we &apos;re excited about \ ngetting this process started .
because we love kids . \ nlove them to death .
well , not actually to death . \ nthat &apos;s just a figure of speech .
we love kids the appropriate amount ..
as allowed by law .
your place is just lovely . \ n- thank you .
yes , this building does have \ na wholesome , family feel to it .
i feel like i &apos;ve been here before . any \ nother couples in the building adopting ?
is that that couple on the first floor ? \ nwe should get a baby before them .
that guy tried to sell me drugs .
but other than that , \ nwholesome , wholesome building .
what ? \ n- i realized why i remember this place .
really ? what is it ? \ n- oh , it &apos;s nothing .
i went on a date with a guy who lived \ nin this building . it didn &apos;t end very well .
that wouldn &apos;t , by any chance , \ nbe joey tribbiani ?
yes ! \ n- of course it was .
we had a great night . in the morning , \ nhe promised he &apos;d call and he didn &apos;t .
rat bastard !
so you &apos;re not friends with him ? \ n- oh , god , no .
no , no , no . \ n- no . nope .
well , i &apos;m sorry i brought it up .
so are either one of you planning \ non staying at home ?
hello ? anybody in there \ norder a celebrity ?
what was that ?
that &apos;s just some crazy guy \ nwho roams the halls here .
he &apos;s great with kids , though .
ross . oh , my god , are you okay ? \ n- son of a bitch !
oh , relax . i didn &apos;t say the f @-@ word .
ross , see , i told you ! \ nthose swings are evil !
that &apos;s the last time emma is getting on \ none of those things for her entire life .
no , no , no . okay , it wasn &apos;t \ nthe swing &apos;s fault . it was my fault .
and kind of that kid &apos;s fault .
who is still laughing . nice .
come on . can we just get out of here \ nbefore somebody else gets hurt ?
no . wait . i have an idea . \ ni want you to get on the swing ..
and you &apos;ll see that there &apos;s \ nnothing to be afraid of .
i know what this is all about .
you &apos;ve always been jealous of my hair .
i just think you &apos;re an adult , okay ? \ nand you should get over your silly fears .
all right , fine . i &apos;ll do it . \ n- good .
if you hold a spider . \ n- where ? ! where ? !
if you hold a spider .
i know .
guys , is everything okay ? \ nit &apos;s me , joey .
adoption !
what &apos;s going on ?
oh , it &apos;s just like i said , that crazy ..
bert , roaming the halls .
guys ? \ n- keep on roaming , bert !
we don &apos;t want any crazy today !
is he all right out there by himself ?
oh , yeah . he has a caretaker . \ nhis older brother ..
ernie .
bert and ernie ? \ n- you can &apos;t make this stuff up .
what &apos;s going on ? \ n- we &apos;ll talk later ! everything &apos;s fine !
everything doesn &apos;t sound fine .
bert and ernie have a big yellow bird .
you never told me about that guy \ nand your sweet 16 .
i &apos;m sorry about that . \ n- oh , it ended okay .
one of my friends shot him .
at least you &apos;ll get a proper wedding . \ nyou really deserve that .
yeah , i really do . you know , \ ni had nothing growing up .
just like the kids \ ni took the money from .
no . no , no . i see where this is going . \ ndon &apos;t make me go back there .
i &apos;m sorry , but i want to regive the money \ nto the children .
but we can &apos;t . i mean , \ nyou called that guy a sweaty little man .
unless you were talking about me . \ nwe never really cleared that up .
look , i can &apos;t have a wedding \ nwith this money now . it &apos;s tainted .
fine , we &apos;ll give the money back .
if that guy at the charity \ ngives us a hard time ..
my friend hasn &apos;t shot anyone \ nin a really long time .
i must say this seems like a lovely \ nenvironment to raise a child in .
you are welcome to look \ nunder any of the furniture ..
because , believe me , you won &apos;t find \ nany porn or cigarettes under there .
before we look around , let me make sure \ ni have everything i need up to here .
why don &apos;t i show you the baby &apos;s room .
what are you doing ? \ n- you wouldn &apos;t let me in .
i thought you were in trouble . \ n- well , we &apos;re not .
but you called me &quot; bert . &quot;
that &apos;s our code word for danger .
we don &apos;t have a code word . \ n- we don &apos;t ?
we really should .
from now on , &quot; bert &quot; \ nwill be our code word for danger .
so that was the baby &apos;s room .
what room should we see next ? \ n- any room that isn &apos;t behind this couch .
some people don &apos;t get him , \ nbut i think he &apos;s really funny .
i did not care for that .
you have to leave .
you slept with our social worker \ nand never called her back .
she is still pissed , \ nso she can &apos;t see you .
okay , okay .
what ? \ n- i forgot my bat .
oh , my god .
and for the last time , \ nwe do not want to be friends with you !
and we don &apos;t wanna buy your bat !
what are you doing here ?
bert . bert . bert . bert .
are you friends with him ? \ n- i can explain .
joey ?
all right . okay .
you have got some nerve \ ncoming back here .
i can &apos;t believe you never called me . \ n- excuse me ?
you probably don &apos;t even remember \ nmy name . it &apos;s joey , by the way .
and don &apos;t bother telling me yours , \ nbecause i totally remember it , lady .
i waited weeks for you to call me .
i gave you my number . \ nyou never called me .
don &apos;t try to turn this around on me .
i am not some kind of social work ..
that you can just ..
do .
i &apos;m pretty sure i gave you my number . \ n- really ? think about it . come on .
you &apos;re a beautiful woman . \ nsmart , funny .
we had a really good time .
if i had your number , \ nwhy wouldn &apos;t i call you ?
i don &apos;t know .
well , maybe i &apos;m wrong . i &apos;m sorry .
hey , too late for apologies . okay ? \ nyou broke my heart .
you know how many women \ ni had to sleep with to get over you ?
joey , wait .. \ n- no !
i waited a long time ! \ ni can &apos;t wait anymore .
i &apos;m sorry that you had to see that . \ ni &apos;m so embarrassed .
oh , that &apos;s really okay . \ n- yeah . we totally understand .
dating is hard . \ n- boy , you people are nice .
and i &apos;ve got to say ..
i think you &apos;re going to make \ nexcellent parents .
laura !
we &apos;re back .
are you here to take more money ?
because i think what you &apos;re \ nlooking for is an atm .
no , no , we &apos;re here \ nto give the money back .
yeah . because you know what ? \ nit &apos;s all about the children .
although it &apos;s also about the wedding .
all right , here . no . oh , god .
if i haven &apos;t said so already , \ nsir , congratulations .
oh , wait . wait .
what if we give half to the charity \ nand we keep half ?
or , no , like , 75 percent for us \ nand 25 percent for .. or , no , like , 90 @-@ 10 .
okay , you know what ? enough , all right ?
i &apos;m stepping in \ nand putting my foot down .
as your future husband , \ ni &apos;m gonna make this decision for us .
what do you think we should do ?
it &apos;s not your decision anymore . \ n- what ?
on behalf of the children of new york , \ ni reject your money .
but we &apos;re giving you this . \ n- and i &apos;m giving it back to you .
come on . consider it a contribution .
well , this is very generous .
take the check . have a great wedding \ nand a wonderful life together .
sounds good to me . we can save up , \ ncome back in a few years ..
and make an even bigger donation .
and when you do , ask for brian .

that &apos;s great . \ n- now we just wait for a call ..
and someone tells us \ nthere &apos;s a baby waiting for us .
hello ?
