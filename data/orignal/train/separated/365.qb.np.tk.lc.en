what time is it ?
late .
something happened .
not good , tony .
what ? what &apos;s going on , jimmy ?
after the fight , ryan was bad .
ryan ? what about ryan ?
he felt sick , tony .
so i took him to the hospital , you know ?
people , they started screaming at me .
they started yelling at me , tony .
about ryan ? are they doing tests ?
yeah , i think so .
but , see , when i went outside ,
the , uh , screaming , it didn &apos;t stop .
who was screaming ?
these crazy guys , man . they were crazy .
and i told them to leave me alone and they wouldn &apos;t listen .
they just wouldn &apos;t listen .
and then i saw all sorts of stuff .
stuff ? what kind of stuff ?
like i saw my ma ,
then i saw my old man .
and then ...
and then i saw the dude at the fight .
but when i looked up ,
you see , the lights , they started spinning .
tony , it was like-- it was like god was
reaching his hand down
and he was trying to take ryan .
look , look , jimmy ,
you &apos;re punchy , j. , you know ?
ryan &apos;s gonna be fine .
you had a tough fight tonight .
you gotta sleep it off .
you sure ?
in the morning everything will be ok .
yeah , you &apos;re probably right .
i &apos;m gonna be fine . everything &apos;s gonna be fine .
thanks , tony .
all right .
jeez , i hope you &apos;re training for something .
or are you just doing sprints for fun ?
no , i &apos;m , uh ...
i &apos;m trying to do this triathlon in february , so ...
oh , yeah . the fbi one . you &apos;re an agent .
yeah , it is the fbi one .
i &apos;m not supposed to ask if you &apos;re an agent .
i work for the justice department .
yeah .
i &apos;ve seen you doing laps at the y , too .
and you &apos;re training for surveillance ?
i am doing an ms triathlon .
it &apos;s in january , but i &apos;m not in as big a rush as you .
well , i just have about 45 minutes a day ,
so , you know , between work and home and--it &apos;s hard .
how &apos;s your biking going ?
oh , i don &apos;t know .
my tires are inflated , i think .
well , you know , i am not the best cyclist ,
so i was gonna ride this weekend ,
and i could use some tips , if you &apos;re not busy .
i ... just don &apos;t know my schedule .
yeah . or we could just see
each other out here or at the pool sometime .
but i should find out in the next couple of days
and i could call you .
that &apos;d be great .
um ... i--i have a card somewhere .
here .
um , yeah .
if something changes . it could be fun .
or at the least , an adventure .
so , uh , what made you think i was an agent ?
i saw the suit .
what else could you be ?
bye .
so , you &apos;re going , right ?
i don &apos;t know .
well , is she cute ?
yes , she is , but i need to focus on my training .
i don &apos;t need to be distracted .
yes , you should be distracted .
distracted is good . what &apos;s her name ?
beth .
i like it .
and you know what they say about riding a bicycle .
who &apos;s getting a bicycle ?
nobody .
let &apos;s get started .
uh , yeah , ok . um , so ,
two men were beaten with a metal pipe
in philadelphia last night .
sam eeks , 58 , he was in town on business .
and then bruce thomas , 32 .
he worked--oh , god--
he worked at a suit shop nearby .
it looks personal .
there was evidence of undoing at the crime scene .
he sat them up on crates .
demonstrating remorse .
in 1976 , george geshwendt cleaned up the crime scene
and covered all 6 victims &apos; faces .
well , this guy did the same thing .
he even cleaned the blood off their necks .
whichever it is , this type of aggression ,
coupled with his loose grip on reality , usually leads to more .
then we can &apos;t take a chance that this guy &apos;s
a one @-@ hit wonder .
exactly . which is why we &apos;re headed to philadelphia .
wheels up in 20 .
&quot; everybody wants to go to heaven ,
but no one wants to die . &quot;
joe louis .
ok , rossi , out with it .
is hotch dating ?
i don &apos;t know .
you know , statistically , widowed men start dating
much faster than females , but hotch is refuting the data .
it &apos;s been 2 years and 19 days .
venus has aligned with mars ,
which means love is in the air
and maybe we will get weekends off .
what ?
is he standing there ?
he &apos;s standing there , isn &apos;t he ?
hello , garcia .
hello . someone talk about the case .
you know , if you look at the severity of the crime ,
this guy have have been experiencing
a significant break from reality .
but he &apos;d have to be pretty cognizant to undo the crime .
that can happen with killing anxiety .
at first the person feels the rage that caused
them to commit the violent act ,
and then they feel remorse . for some , that remorse
turns into desire to do it again .
soldiers recovering from battle often experience both emotions
in rapid succession , if not simultaneously .
garcia , make sure that the m.e. &apos; s reports
are waiting for us when we get there .
yes , sir , i &apos;ve already sent her an email .
what was the relationship of the victims ?
local p.d. believes they knew each other .
that area is pretty desolate at night ,
and sam was carrying takeout for two .
they also died within minutes of each other
and they both had defensive wounds .
usually two random guys
don &apos;t fight the same person to the death .
which means the unsub is that much more skilled .
how do you subdue two men at once ?
maybe he had a gun .
so why not use it ?
he released more rage with a pipe .
so he hit one and then quickly blitzed the other .
well , however he did it ,
our unsub has to be pretty fit .
these guys put up a fight .
oh , come on , jimmy , ease up . ease up , man .
oh , come on , man , what are you swinging at ?
come in behind your jab .
jimmy , stop brawling .
you want to brawl , brawl with a target .
come on , go to the body .
all right , time , time , time .
what are you doing ? what you swingin &apos; at , huh ?
let you hands go . you had the shot .
what &apos;s the matter ? come on . let &apos;s call it a day .
i &apos;m sorry , tony . i keep thinking about my kid .
your kid &apos;s been sick since he was crawling .
what do the doctors say ?
they &apos;re running some tests .
they &apos;ve done that before . they come up clean .
yeah .
hey , look , are you gonna be ready tomorrow night ?
i mean , the cannon is gonna be gunning for you .
yeah , i &apos;ll be fine .
look , tony , i talked to billie .
she &apos;s got an mma fight where she thinks i can make 1,000 bucks .
you know how i feel about that knuckle @-@ dragging crap .
we haven &apos;t spent 9 years together for nothing .
come on , tony .
look , jimmy , you are a fighter .
a real fighter .
and when you &apos;re lowering the boom
on the cannon tomorrow night ,
remember what i told you--
great fighters are made , not born .
come on .
damn .
check this out .
the unsub blitz @-@ attacked sam over in this area
and then dragged him back over there .
that would explain why he was able to subdue them both .
as he cleans up sam , bruce comes by .
well , it makes sense .
there &apos;s no way he could attack both of them
and then drag them back to that spot .
this--this is rational and organized .
our unsub didn &apos;t have a psychotic break .
he knew what he was doing .
he had rage toward both these victims .
and remorse .
yeah , but how are the two connected ?
i mean , it &apos;s a crappy alley .
nothing around here is open at night .
how about that ?
hospital .
jimmy .
jimmy , wake up .
jimmy , get up .
we gotta get him to eat something .
you know , you could do better than that .
i can &apos;t .
you haven &apos;t eaten anything
since we brought you in here last night .
you remember what i told you .
this one is a right cross .
and this one an uppercut .
and if we need to , we &apos;ll knock it out again .
how &apos;s it going , ryan ?
my stomach hurts .
i know . the medicine will be kicking in anytime now .
and so will the food .
as soon as you eat it , ok , baby ?
can i have a moment with the two of you ?
yeah .
hey . when we get back in here ,
i want to see that plat empty , all right , buddy ?
what &apos;s up ? you run the tests ?
his abnormal cell count is incredibly high .
i &apos;m afraid that ryan &apos;s leukemia is back .
well , uh , we &apos;ll give him some chemo , try some radiation .
he didn &apos;t respond to that before . it just made him throw up .
then we &apos;ll give him a different kind .
what kind ? there isn &apos;t another kind .
look , i know you two just divorced .
but you need to be on the same page for ryan .
what about a bone marrow transplant ?
my neighbor &apos;s uncle got one . he &apos;s swimming in puerto rico now .
that &apos;s a possibility ,
but there are factors that we have to consider .
factors like what ? the insurance covers it , right ?
let &apos;s not get ahead of ourselves .
we &apos;ll run some more lab
work and then we &apos;ll discuss other options .
ok ?
this is about money , pammy . he &apos;s playing us .
he &apos;s a doctor . why would he do that ?
because he thinks that we can &apos;t afford it .
but we &apos;re getting ryan that transplant .
i don &apos;t care how much it costs .
what do you got ?
he volunteered here , went to get a snack around 11 : 00 last night .
that &apos;s the same time as the killings .
he always went to the same sub shop across the street .
he &apos;d cut through the alley to get there . anything on sam ?
garcia just spoke with a co @-@ worker .
turns out they come to philly one week a month
and stay at a nearby hotel .
that &apos;s who sam was getting dinner for .
so these victims weren &apos;t together .
no . and if bruce is a volunteer here ,
then he &apos;s a good samaritan type
and probably came upon the scene and tried to intervene .
ok , so if it wasn &apos;t personal ,
then the anger was weighing on the unsub
prior to the altercation .
then the question is , what does that stem from ?
hey , jimmy .
whoa , jimmy .
now , that &apos;s $ 1,500 , everything i got to my name .
i need you to put it on me for tomorrow night &apos;s fight .
i can &apos;t do that .
sure you can .
ryan needs a bone marrow transplant .
pam &apos;s insurance ain &apos;t gonna cut it .
where &apos;d you get this from ?
i hocked some stuff .
i can beat the cannon .
you said it yourself .
jimmy . jimmy , i don &apos;t know--
if you &apos;re not gonna do it , i &apos;ll go over there and do it myself .
fine . but this isn &apos;t for you . it &apos;s for ryan .
there &apos;s that punching bag drink before .
what did you just say ?
hey . don &apos;t waste it on him .
yeah , you need lots of rest if you &apos;re gonna get
knocked out tomorrow .
do what i ask , please .
i talked to the m.e.
it turns out sam was hit with a pipe about 10 times .
bruce was beaten over 30 .
that &apos;s either adrenaline or an extremely high endurance level .
he had the remorse one experiences from killing
anxiety for both victims ,
but the increase in hits on the second victim
indicates that he started to enjoy it .
it could be overkill .
but overkill usually means a personal relationship .
if the victims didn &apos;t know each other ,
it &apos;s unlikely the unsub knew them .
so what would account for this level of blood @-@ letting ?
the primal rage could be about the blood itself .
if he &apos;s enjoying the killing , then he &apos;s getting aroused by it
and developing a kind of blood lust .
then why hasn &apos;t he done it again ?
maybe he hasn &apos;t had the chance .
hey , i &apos;ll see you , frankie .
so i &apos;m the punching bag , huh ?
you called me a punching bag ?
their skulls are cracked completely open .
teeth on the ground .
his blood lust is increasing .
he didn &apos;t clean up this time . his remorse is waning .
this guy would have to be in great shape to do this .
but this type of strenuous killing could result in fatigue ,
increase in appetite , and disorientation .
like he ran a marathon .
for some it could also result in convulsive episodes .
epilepsy ?
sort of . oftentimes after you you kill ,
neurons in your brain misfire and you become overstimulated ,
which causes you to start seeing things .
hey , hey , jimmy !
daddy !
jimmy .
you all right ?
yeah , i &apos;m good .
whoa , maybe you ought to sit down here .
whoa , whoa , jeez , jimmy , easy .
you know what ?
i &apos;m gonna get monty to step in for you .
no , i put everything on this . i gotta win .
yeah , but if you &apos;re not feeling well , jimmy , then you can &apos;t--
i &apos;m fine .
all right .
we &apos;re looking for a physically fit white male
in his 20s to early 30s .
he &apos;s killing these men , but he &apos;s not robbing
or sexually assaulting them .
initially we saw that he was experiencing killing anxiety ,
which led him to clean up the bodies postmortem out of remorse .
now his remorse has subsided ,
and he seems to be experiencing blood lust .
blood lust means the killer &apos;s aroused
by the sight of blood .
upon seeing it , his body releases adrenaline and dopamine ,
which is causing the violence to escalate .
the urge to become violent
is so overwhelming that he &apos;s pulverizing his victims
to a point way beyond what &apos;s needed to kill them .
the force with which he &apos;s doing this makes us
think he &apos;s in shape .
after killing , our unsub is probably lying dormant ,
either recuperating from physical exertion
or possibly developing aphasia and convulsive attacks .
based upon the rage involved in these kills ,
we believe our unsub is probably depressed
or feels like life is working against him .
off the roap , jimmy !
yes ! yes , dad , that &apos;s it !
consequently , he &apos;ll put himself in situations
where he can feel the high from drawing blood ,
which he views as power and control over his life .
4 ... 5 ...
6 ... 7 ...
8 ... 9 ...
10 !
you &apos;re out !
we did it ! we did it !
we did it !
yeah , you did it ! you did it ! we did it !
was the violence inflicted with a pipe ?
no . this was hand @-@ made .
and you know what &apos;s interesting ?
there was severe damage to the liver and kidneys .
i mean , look at the bloating .
so he changed his m.o.
and increased his rage . he did more damage with his hands
than he did with a pipe .
what about the orbital bones ?
shattered . both victims &apos; eye sockets were broken .
this guy &apos;s got a hell of a left .
where &apos;s the money ?
i forgot to bet it .
what the hell do you mean ? that money &apos;s for ryan .
between training you and getting ready for the fight ,
it slipped my mind .
well , then i want it back .
i don &apos;t have it on me .
well , then write me a check .
do i look like a bank ?
don &apos;t tell me this .
don &apos;t tell me this .
jimmy , i ...
don &apos;t tell me this , you son of a bitch !
you bet against me , didn &apos;t you ?
i thought i was doing you a favor .
you said that i could beat him !
you can , but i knew you weren &apos;t feeling well .
oh , no .
how many times , tony ? how many times you scalp me ?
this was the first , jimmy . i swear .
yeah ? prove that .
come on , kid , we &apos;re--we &apos;re family .
jimmy ?
hey , jimmy !
we saw the bodies . all of the victims have stress breaks
in exactly the same places .
that &apos;s consistent with the kind of accuracy you get
from years of fight training .
fight training ? you think he &apos;s a boxer ?
it makes sense . a fighter would have the endurance it takes
to commit this kind of overkill on this many people
with a pipe or with his hands .
it would explain why at the first crime scene
he lined the bodies up in the corner . it &apos;s like a ring .
it makes sense about the blood lust ,
but what triggered the killings ?
garcia , i need all the information you can find me
on the philadelphia boxing scene .
well , let &apos;s see . there &apos;s &quot; rocky &quot; i through v.
and let &apos;s not forget about that last one .
penelope ...
sorry . kidding .
here we go . real stuff .
uh , let &apos;s see .
the city produced such greats as tyrone everett
and the late joe frazier , who developed the philly
style of punching people .
and then ... the sport took off
to atlantic city and vegas ,
which put a dent in the philadelphia scene ,
but it did not kill the city &apos;s passion for the sport .
i gotta speak to lou , please .
come on . i gotta talk to him .
what &apos;s up ?
a lot of people gotta talk to me .
you make it quick .
how many times has my scumbag trainer bet against me , huh ?
once ? twice ?
oh , come on , jimmy .
just tell me .
been your whole career .
wise up , kid . how do you think he got that cadillac ?
you can &apos;t be that punchy , jimmy .
you knew that .
everybody knew that .
both of them were beaten to death .
looks as if he used his hands again .
he took valuables this time . gold jewelry , watches ,
and some cash from the safe .
apparently this guy &apos;s a bookie , too .
a guy named tony cole lost $ 3,000 in a fight last night .
what was the amount of his usual bet ?
no more than $ 500 .
i &apos;m gonna call garcia .
penelope , how &apos;s the greatest computer tech
this side of the mississippi ?
floats like a butterfly , stings like a bee ,
garcia &apos;s gonna find what only her screens can see .
what do you need , baby ?
411 on a tony cole .
ok , let &apos;s see .
tony was a middleweight star back in the eighties .
and then he was in a really bad lawn @-@ mowing accident .
and that laid him up for a
few months and he had to throw in the towel .
what &apos;s he doing now ?
he is a trainer at a local south philly boxing gym .
fits the profile . he probably has embedded anger
for not succeeding in the sport .
yeah , but why change his m.o. and start stealing stuff ?
the theft feels like an afterthought .
something changed in his life and he &apos;s desperate for money .
jimmy , i &apos;ve been trying to call you .
where &apos;s his doctor ?
i haven &apos;t seen him , but we &apos;ve got to talk .
hey , dr. surna .
jimmy , wait .
dr. surna , here it is .
what is this for ?
ryan &apos;s bone marrow transplant .
what are you talking about ?
you said he could get one but we needed the money .
i never said that , mr. hall .
yeah , you did .
mr. hall , i said we needed to wait .
not because of the money but because i needed to do more tests .
didn &apos;t pam tell you ?
i was trying .
trying to tell me what ?
ryan &apos;s not strong enough to get the chemo .
this isn &apos;t for the chemo , this is for the transplant .
he needs the chemo to get him ready for the transplant ,
but his body &apos;s too weak to handle it .
no , no . he &apos;s a tough kid .
i know he &apos;s a tough kid .
mr. hall , the cancer cells are multiplying too rapidly .
your son &apos;s not gonna make it .
i know that he is a tough kid ,
so when is he gonna get out of here ?
jimmy , are you listening ?
ryan &apos;s dying .
ok ?
he &apos;s gonna die .
if tony is the unsub ,
why would he ransack his own place ?
it was someone else , but he knew him .
there &apos;s no signs of forced entry .
maybe someone knew he robbed a bookie ,
so they came here and robbed him .
it doesn &apos;t look like anything &apos;s been taken .
the tv &apos;s still here .
except maybe tony himself .
look at this damage .
and the way this door jamb is slightly torn from this side ,
as if someone was holding on .
if it was for retaliation ,
they would have killed tony right here .
maybe we got it wrong .
maybe tony didn &apos;t kill the bookie .
lou was a small @-@ time thug
and he would have had lots of enemies .
who would have had a motive to kill lou
and abduct tony .
the unsub could be one of tony &apos;s fighters .
he &apos;d definitely have the strength to do both .
hey , dad .
how you feeling ?
i &apos;m ok .
you fighting tonight ?
i &apos;m not sure .
whenever you box , i feel better .
well , there might not be another one for a while , buddy .
what &apos;s going on ?
everybody &apos;s whispering today .
ma even came in here crying .
you know how she is .
am i gonna die ?
no . don &apos;t even say it .
don &apos;t even say that .
remember what i told you ?
right in the sickness &apos; face .
that &apos;s right .
and that &apos;s why you &apos;re getting the blood transfusion .
dad , i &apos;m scared .
don &apos;t be scared , ryan . you &apos;re a fighter .
ok ?
i don &apos;t care what anybody tells you .
you &apos;re a fighter .
dad , you all right ?
yeah .
it &apos;s gonna be ok . it &apos;s gonna be ok .
you &apos;re gonna be fine .
where are you going ?
tony &apos;s car broke down . i gotta drop him off somewhere .
tony &apos;ll work with anyone ,
those coming up , those going down .
we &apos;ll need a list of names .
tony train any tomato cans ?
professional opponents . guys who lose all the time .
he trained some cat named jimmy hall .
guy &apos;s got the heart of a fighter ,
but his technique &apos;s all over the place .
jimmy hall ? didn &apos;t he win a fight last night ?
hey , there &apos;s a first time for everything .
why would tony bet against his own fighter ? isn &apos;t that illegal ?
money &apos;s tight , sweetheart .
thank you .
all right , so maybe tony assumed jimmy was gonna lose
and then he was stunned when he actually won .
baby girl , i need a little information on a local fighter .
guy named jimmy hall .
jimmy hall . ok .
oh , he has been hit with some hard knocks .
grew up in the kensington section of philadelphia
in foster homes .
kicked out of 3 middle schools ,
one time for beating a kid into a coma .
so he &apos;s had a violent streak .
he dropped out of high school , found his way to the ring ,
and doesn &apos;t have much of a record , though .
that &apos;s &apos; cause he was never really a fighter .
do you think this is sublimation ?
that &apos;s what it looks like .
i &apos;ve heard of killers sublimating the need to hurt
by becoming cops and soldiers , but never boxers .
this guy &apos;s no different . he had a subconscious desire to kill ,
so he got himself into boxing where he could do it legally .
yeah , but it still doesn &apos;t explain the blood lust .
if he &apos;s been a fighter , he &apos;s been around blood his whole career .
well , it didn &apos;t affect
him until something triggered it 3 days ago .
the guy snapped and then became a serial killer .
garcia , send me jimmy &apos;s address . thanks , mama .
yeah . here you go .
jimmy .
we need to talk .
come on , jimmy , open up .
this is our kid .
ma &apos;am , step away from the door .
step away .
what &apos;s going on ?
jimmy hall !
jim and i used to be married . what is happening ?
do you know where your ex @-@ husband is ?
what is going on ?
he may have been involved in a killing .
jimmy ? no way .
there are two beds in there . does someone else stay here ?
my son , on weekends . but he &apos;s sick now .
is your son in county hospital ?
yes . he was admitted 3 days ago .
his leukemia &apos;s back .
did jimmy get into a fight after that happened ?
yeah . he got into an argument with some guys outside .
how do you know that ?
it &apos;s probably what triggered the killings .
have you seen jimmy today ?
at the hospital .
he tried to pay for our son &apos;s
bone marrow transplant in cash ,
but it &apos;s too late for the operation . ryan &apos;s dying .
do you know where jimmy went after that ?
sometimes when ryan &apos;s not feeling well ,
jimmy gets in the ring .
it helps ryan feel better .
oh , wait .
what is it ?
he did say that tony &apos;s car broke down
and he needed to take him somewhere .
excuse me .
it &apos;s the hospital .
hello ?
jimmy &apos;s at his end game . he &apos;s probably already abducted tony .
his desire for blood is most likely increasing .
what do you think he &apos;ll do ?
he &apos;ll put himself into a position to see more .
i &apos;m so glad you called .
what do you mean , he &apos;s worse ?
you son of a bitch .
no , jimmy .
you &apos;re like a son .
you lied to me !
jimmy ...
i don &apos;t care what anybody says .
i always knew you were a boxer .
you remember what i said ?
boxers are made , they &apos;re not born .
i got a kid !
i got a kid , too , jimmy !
what about my family ?
what about my family , jimmy ? jimmy , please .
jimmy , i was gonna give it back .
don &apos;t , jimmy--
we have cops canvassing the area ,
checking every place jimmy and tony ever went .
we also put uniforms outside the hospital ,
just in case jimmy goes back to see his son .
should we check the boxing matches ?
garcia , i need a list of every middleweight fight
in the philadelphia area tonight .
nothing on the docket , friend .
what about underground fights or smokers ?
i &apos;ll see .
only one . the other 3 are mmas .
did jimmy ever fight mma ?
nothing that &apos;s been documented , no .
most old @-@ school trainers won &apos;t let you cross over .
well , if he got his trainer out of the picture
and he needs to see more blood , he might try that tonight .
it &apos;s just about the most violent sport there is .
hey , i just sent you the addresses .
all right , let &apos;s go .
jimmy .
you ready ?
yeah , i &apos;m almost there .
you finally convinced tony to let you do this ?
i didn &apos;t give him much of a choice .
about time .
hey , we &apos;re looking for a fighter , jimmy hall .
he might have just signed up , you know , last @-@ minute thing .
unless he &apos;s got two boobs he plans to tape down ,
he ain &apos;t fighting tonight .
and in this corner ,
weighing in at 185 pounds ,
the new jersey nightmare ,
the punishing pete dunkle !
and in this corner ,
weighing in at 175 pounds ,
the south philly cyclone ,
jimmy hall !
hotch , we just left the gym on second street .
no sign of jimmy . you ?
morgan and jj struck out , too .
he must be at moody &apos;s . we &apos;re almost there .
yes ! yes , dad , that &apos;s it ! that &apos;s it !
yes , go ! i think that &apos;s it !
go , dad ! go , dad , that &apos;s it !
hold it !
you all right ?
ryan ?
ryan ? !
fight !
he &apos;s here .
what &apos;s he doing ?
why isn &apos;t he tapping the floor to end it ?
because he wants to be taken to the hospital
so he can see his son .
bp &apos;s 50 over 30 .
i need to see ryan , please .
i need to talk to him .
not now .
let &apos;s get him to trauma .
where &apos;s dad ?
he &apos;ll be here , sweetie .
you rest .
how is he ?
he suffered severe blows to the head
and he lost a lot of blood .
can he talk ?
yeah , but he &apos;s weak .
so make it quick .
i will .
jimmy .
i &apos;m agent hotchner with the fbi .
i know what happened tonight .
my son is here . i gotta see him .
we know that &apos;s why you threw the fight .
and we know you know what &apos;s happening .
yeah , he &apos;s a fighter and he &apos;s gonna make it .
jimmy , they &apos;ve stopped the transfusions .
that doesn &apos;t mean anything .
listen to me .
ryan doesn &apos;t have a lot of time left .
and he &apos;s scared .
he &apos;s not scared of dying .
he &apos;s scared of disappointing you .
trust me , any chance he has of feeling
some peace in this moment
is gonna depend on what you say to him right now .
so go in there and be his father .
not a fighter , not a trainer .
right now ryan needs his dad .
is that you , dad ?
yeah , it &apos;s me , buddy .
what happened ?
my fight didn &apos;t go too well .
did you win ?
no , i got knocked out , kiddo . i got knocked out .
but ... you always win .
well , i couldn &apos;t , you know ? i just couldn &apos;t .
and when i was in that ring
getting punched over and over again ,
i figured out something .
sometimes , i want to fight ,
but my body , it keeps telling me to stop .
and it doesn &apos;t matter how hard i punch , it just--
i can &apos;t do it .
and , uh ...
and when that happens , you know what i do ?
i let go , ryan .
and what i figured out is ...
letting go doesn &apos;t mean that you &apos;re a quitter .
it doesn &apos;t mean that you lost .
it just means that you realize in that moment
that &apos;s it &apos;s time to let go
and move on .
so if it &apos;s time , ryan , it &apos;s all right .
&apos;cause you fought a hell of a fight .
your mother and i , we both love you .
don &apos;t you ever forget that .
i love you , too , daddy .

&quot; some of us think holding on makes us strong .
but sometimes it is letting go . &quot;
right .
all right , thank you .
so jimmy didn &apos;t lie .
philadelphia p.d. just found tony &apos;s body in a warehouse .
great .
so , is the doomsday bike ride happening ?
yes , it is .
tomorrow morning , 9 : 00 .
but , uh , i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m pretty sure haley wouldn &apos;t want you to avoid moving on .
i &apos;m not avoiding moving on .
i &apos;m just not sure .
not sure about what ? going on a bike ride ?
aaron , i know you think it &apos;s too soon ,
but you &apos;re no good to anyone when you &apos;re miserable .
i &apos;m not miserable .
ehh ... maybe slightly uptight .
all right , i &apos;ll give you slightly uptight .
if there &apos;s one thing i learned from carolyn &apos;s death ,
it &apos;s that life is short .
and you deserve to be happy .
i know .
then have a good time .
thanks .
so are your tires pumped ?
i hope so .
so you haven &apos;t done a lot of biking ?
no , not a ton .
but you &apos;re gonna do a triathlon ?
go big or go home . that &apos;s what my dad always says .
your dad sounds smart .
he was .
he passed away a few months ago .
i &apos;m sorry .
is your mom still alive ?
yeah . she &apos;s doing a lot better .
that &apos;s good .
how are you doing ?
i &apos;m hanging in there .
so where are we going ?
uh , i usually go up connecticut and through rock creek park
and then back down 16th ,
but we don &apos;t have to do all that if you don &apos;t want to .
no , let &apos;s do this .
if we lose each other ,
we will meet back at dupont circle for coffee .
lose each other ? i thought we were gonna do this together .
