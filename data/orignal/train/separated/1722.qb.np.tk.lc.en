第六季 第二十一集
oh , dear .
penny , have you been recording shows
on our dvr again ?
no .
answer honestly . this is not a trial .
that &apos;ll come later .
absolutely not .
help me out here . i can &apos;t afford another demerit .
yeah .
uh ... maybe we were hacked .
you know , the chinese have been hacking everything lately .
why would the chinese make our dvr record paul blart : mall cop ?
i don &apos;t know .
it &apos;s a fat guy on a segway . that &apos;s funny everywhere .
i &apos;m deleting it .
well , hang on .
maybe the chinese haven &apos;t finished watching it yet .
you know , if you &apos;re trying to make space on the dvr ,
why don &apos;t you just get rid of
some of the stuff you &apos;ve already watched ?
like , um ... alphas .
no , that &apos;s the season two finale .
that was quite the cliffhanger .
i &apos;m going to re @-@ watch it before season three starts .
there is no season three . they canceled that show .
well , they can &apos;t cancel it .
it ended on a cliffhanger .
they did .
uh , sheldon ,
there are two dumplings left . do you want them ?
dumplings ?
don &apos;t you understand what &apos;s going on here ?
as a rule , no .
that show ended with all the residents of new york
either dead or unconscious .
now i &apos;ll never know what happened .
well , why don &apos;t you make up your own ending ?
oh , sure , what a wonderful idea .
and after that ,
i &apos;ll make up my own rules of oral hygiene .
you know , instead of flossing , i &apos;ll rub pudding on my gums .
i &apos;m going to get the number of the syfy channel
and give them what for .
oh , please , don &apos;t do that .
no . they can &apos;t just cancel a show like alphas .
you know ? they have to help the viewers let go .
firefly did a movie to wrap things up .
buffy the vampire slayer continued on as a comic book .
heroes gradually lowered the quality season by season
till we were grateful it ended .
i feel bad for whoever gets that phone call .
ah , don &apos;t .
if they didn &apos;t want to be yelled at by crazy nerds ,
they shouldn &apos;t have started a sci @-@ fi channel .
i think you &apos;re gonna be really happy
with this security camera .
the optics are great ,
it &apos;s got infrared technology ,
and there &apos;s even a backup battery when the power goes out .
whatever .
i can see my little princess
while i &apos;m at work , right ?
why can &apos;t you just watch porn like a regular guy ?
i need your laptop so i can configure the software .
wait , hold on .
this is weird .
what ?
i was googling that girl i &apos;ve been dating ,
and i found her blog .
cool .
anything juicy ?
she said she recently went on a date with a guy named roger ?
and he &apos;s indian ?
and he &apos;s an astrophysicist , too ?
you know what &apos;s going on , don &apos;t you ?
yes . mummy was right .
american girls are sexually voracious devils .
i can &apos;t believe i have to explain this .
people change names on blogs to protect their privacy .
roger is raj .
i always thought , if i had a white name ,
it would be gavin .
keep reading . what does it say ?
no , no , i don &apos;t know if i should .
if she wanted me to know about her blog , she would &apos;ve told me .
it &apos;s almost like i &apos;m reading her diary .
that &apos;s exactly what it &apos;s like . keep reading .
no , this is creepy .
oh , i think we were looking at creepy in the rearview mirror
when i put up that camera .
it &apos;s not creepy . don &apos;t listen to him .
oh , look who &apos;s got the sweetest kisses .
should i go ?
with all the tv sheldon was talking about ,
i had the greatest idea ever .
it even blows away my idea
for a star wars themed coffee shop called &quot; brewbacca &apos;s . &quot;
you need to watch buffy the vampire slayer .
it is the perfect show for the two of us .
it &apos;s got action and jokes
and hot vampires and romance . i cannot oversell this !
what do you say ?
it &apos;s 6 : 30 in the morning .
i thought you grew up on a farm .
hello , syfy network ?
yeah , this is your vice president of programming .
now , we have made a horrible mistake regarding alphas .
yeah , we need to uncancel it immediately .
well , you just put me through to the people who handle that ,
you tell them it &apos;s me ,
and i don &apos;t want to answer a lot of questions
about if i really am who i say i am , you know ?
i just ... i want this done .
no , i am not the person who just called .
that man was clearly a cowboy .
yeah , who was plumb concerned
about y &apos;all canceling his favorite show .
why do they keep hanging up on me ?
i &apos;m sorry you &apos;re upset .
you know , sheldon , sometimes people seek the comfort
of physical contact in moments like this .
i am not flying back to texas
just so my mom can give me a hug .
okay .
well , what i think is going on here
is you have a pathological need for closure .
oh , that &apos;s nonsense .
i mean , you tell me stories about your day all the time .
i don &apos;t care how they end .
you know , i might be able to help you with this .
there &apos;s a whole field of behavioral neuroscience
that examines ways to retrain your neural pathways
so stuff like this bothers you less .
yeah , but i just told you ,
i don &apos;t have a problem with closure .
you sure about that ?
oh , quite sure .
that proves nothing .
ready to go to lunch ?
do you think i &apos;m feminine ?
yeah . let &apos;s go .
thanks a lot .
what &apos;s going on ?
i broke down , and i read lucy &apos;s blog .
and in one of the entries ,
she said , when we first met ,
i struck her as a little feminine .
just a little ? that &apos;s great .
i have to talk to her about this .
oh , geez , why do you girls always want to talk about things ?
listen to me ,
if she &apos;s writing about your relationship ,
use it to your advantage .
rig the game .
well , that doesn &apos;t seem fair .
is it fair that girls like confident , normal guys
more than nervous weirdos ?
no , it &apos;s not .
i &apos;ve always thought that was unfair .
so take what &apos;s in that blog and use it to get her pants off .
why do you have to make everything so filthy ?
why couldn &apos;t you just say the blog is like
her giving me the key to her heart ?
&quot; the key to her heart . &quot;
that &apos;s nice .
were you quoting someone
or is it tattooed on the small of your back ?
i was quoting a man who knows a thing or two about women :
sir elton john .
so , did you love it ?
of course you loved it . how could you not love it ?
tell me how much you loved it .
it was cute .
oh , don &apos;t say cute .
that &apos;s the worst .
what &apos;s wrong with cute ?
it just makes things seem small .
it diminishes them .
so you want me to stop calling your little tushy cute ?
you can try , but nobody &apos;s gonna believe you .
i just ... i don &apos;t understand how you can watch a show that great
and not be excited by it .
i liked it . i &apos;m excited .
well , then , tell your face .
what do you want from me ?
you know what ?
never mind . we gave it a shot .
let &apos;s just see what else is on .
oh , come on , don &apos;t be like that .
i &apos;m sorry i called it cute .
let &apos;s watch another one .
really ?
yeah , it was fun .
kind of reminded me of my high school .
but instead of vampires , we had meth heads .
but both came out at night and had messed up teeth .
all right , cool .
i @-@ i think you &apos;ll like the next one better .
all the cheerleaders are suffering from an evil curse .
oh . well , that &apos;s like my high school , too .
but instead of a curse , it was crabs .
i &apos;ve come up with a series of exercises
to help with your compulsive need for closure .
i take issue with the word &quot; compulsive . &quot;
all i &apos;m saying is ,
we live in a world where closure isn &apos;t always an op ...
... tion . okay .
for the sake of argument , let &apos;s say i have a problem .
what would be your plan for addressing it ?
i &apos;m going to recondition your brain
so that the need for completion isn &apos;t so overwhelming .
by playing tic @-@ tac @-@ toe ?
yep . your turn .
oh , amy .
and you wonder why people think neuroscience
is nothing but a goofy game for diaper babies .
tic @-@ tac @-@ toe can only end in win , lose or draw ...
none of which will deny me closure .
especially since i &apos;m about to win .
b @-@ but we didn &apos;t finish .
exactly .
how does that make you feel ?
the same way any normal person would .
feel like i want to peel off my own face
and tear it in two and then again and again
until i have a handful of sheldon @-@ face confetti .
and that &apos;s exactly the feeling we want to address
with this course of treatment .
yeah , or you could pitch in , grab a nostril
and help me get this face off .
come on , you can do this .
you don &apos;t know what it &apos;s like to feel completely frustrated .
to have a @-@ a desire build up within you
and be denied any opportunity for release .
yeah , sounds like a drag .
okay , help me out here .
why does he love this show so much ?
well , there was action , it was funny .
i mean , you do get that usually the monster chases the pretty girl ,
but this time the pretty girl chases the monsters ?
yippee , it &apos;s backwards . i get it .
why does this bother you so much ?
i don &apos;t know .
it &apos;s just , he &apos;s so passionate about so many different things .
i just don &apos;t get that way .
do you ?
well , sure . i &apos;m pretty passionate about science .
i remember the first time i looked through a microscope
and saw millions of tiny microorganisms .
it was like a whole other universe .
if i wanted to , i could wipe it out with my thumb like a god .
see ? i wish i had some of that fire in my life .
i mean , i want to care about things
and get excited like you guys .
well , there &apos;s no reason you can &apos;t .
you think ?
absolutely . all we need to do is spend
a little time and find something you &apos;re passionate about .
that sounds like a lot of work .
hey , what &apos;s up ?
uh , lucy &apos;s coming over . i need some advice .
however long you think the foreplay should be , triple it .
just tell me which one you think is more manly .
this hockey jersey or ...
this football jersey .
i don &apos;t know . go with hockey .
good-- black is more slimming .
oh , that &apos;s her .
i got to go be butch . toodles .
come in .
oh , look how cute your little doggy is .
yeah , well , i wouldn &apos;t get too close .
if i give the right command in german ,
she &apos;ll rip your face off .
* o &apos;er the land of the free *
* and the home of the ... *
next .
that &apos;s quite an impressive layout , isn &apos;t it ?
yes .
let &apos;s box it up .
&quot; let &apos;s box it up . &quot;
that &apos;s enough .
sheldon , sheldon , give it !
okay , sheldon , make a wish and blow out the candles .
oops , missed one .
now your wish can &apos;t come true .
lucky for you , &apos; cause i wished you were dead .
i like your jersey .
thanks . i love hockey .
oh , cool . so does my dad .
we watched it all the time growing up .
who &apos;s your favorite player ?
not brian boitano , that &apos;s for sure .
how &apos;s your burrito ?
it &apos;s still a little frozen in the middle .
probably because i didn &apos;t read the instructions .
no wrapper &apos;s going to tell me what to do .
unless his name is jay @-@ z.
is something going on ?
what do you mean ?
well , you &apos;re acting all weird .
and i &apos;m pretty weird ,
so i think i know what i &apos;m talking about .
i don &apos;t know . maybe it &apos;s all those steroids i &apos;ve been taking .
i think i &apos;m gonna go .
thank you for the burrito and the pork rinds
and the 20 @-@ minute lecture
on why monster trucks are better than regular trucks .
wait , wait .
i @-@ i found your blog where you wrote about me .
oh . i kind of just write that for myself .
i didn &apos;t think anybody actually read it .
no kidding . you didn &apos;t make it easy to find .
i spent hours digging around online .
for the record , you have excellent credit scores .
and your diabetic aunt seems
to be adjusting to her new leg just fine .
why were you acting so strange tonight ?
you called me feminine .
and i ...
i wanted you to think i was more manly .
raj , i didn &apos;t say &quot; feminine &quot; was a bad thing .
i meant that you &apos;re sweet and thoughtful
and your skin looks so much like caramel ,
i just want to dip an apple in your face .
i do have a pretty balls @-@ to @-@ the @-@ wall
moisturizing regimen .
so , are you okay ?
yeah .
good .
do you even like hockey ?
no .
bought this at the staples center
when i went to see taylor swift .
so , i was thinking how excited you get
about stuff like buffy or science
or which tv remote you and sheldon should buy .
the &quot; harmony one &quot; was fine .
we didn &apos;t need to upgrade to the 1100,
which he knows is too big for my hand .
see , that &apos;s the kind of passion i didn &apos;t think i had .
but then i realized i &apos;m passionate about you .
oh ... my cute little tushy strikes again .
no , i &apos;m serious .
look , i &apos;ve always had these plans .
i was gonna be in movies and live this glamorous life ,
and anything less than that
just wasn &apos;t worth getting excited about .
those things can still happen .
oh , obviously it &apos;s gonna happen .
yeah , a psychic at a bachelorette party told me so .
anyway , what i meant was ...
i shouldn &apos;t wait , you know ?
i &apos;ve got you , i &apos;ve got sheldon ,
all these wonderful friends .
my life is exciting right now .
that &apos;s a big deal .
it is , isn &apos;t it ?
so , does that mean we get to do stuff
like talk about cool shows or get dressed up
in matching costumes and go to comic @-@ con ?
leonard , i had an epiphany , not a stroke .
amy , i must say , i was skeptical at first ,
but this has truly been a transformative evening .
i &apos;m a little surprised to hear you feeling so positive .
well , you &apos;re an excellent neuroscientist ,
you &apos;re a wonderful girlfriend , and ...
and ?
doesn &apos;t matter , does it ?
i &apos;m proud of you , sheldon .
and a complete sucker .
oh , yeah .
there he is .
* and the home of the brave ... *
don &apos;t stop . yes , keep going .
just like that . almost there , almost there .
sheldon , you big weirdo ,
i want you to know that i love that you &apos;re in my life .
i love you , too .
hello . uh , is this the bruce miller who wrote
the season finale of alphas ?
oh , smashing . yeah , you already sound nicer
than the last bruce miller who suggested
i have sexual relations with myself .
yeah , now , down to business .
um , your show ended on a cliffhanger .
could you please tell me how you planned to resolve it ?
i see .
well , that all stinks .
no wonder you got canceled . bye .
