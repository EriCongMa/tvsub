第四季 第十四集
what are you in for ?
you don &apos;t know ?
mr. williams ...
principal fisk will see you now .
thank you .
hope you beat the rap , buddy , all right ?
keep your chin up .
the school code of conduct requires that students both act
in a safe and responsible manner
and respect the rights of their peers .
unfortunately , grace is here today
because she violated both those rules .
okay , uh , look , i , uh , i , uh ,
i know what kind of kids get called into the principal &apos;s office .
i know that because i was one of those kids .
but in this case ,
the apple falls very far away from the tree , okay ?
grace is a very sweet and , uh ,
respectful young lady , always .
no one doubts that , mr. williams .
but the fact remains
that your daughter physically struck a classmate .
well , then i &apos;m gonna have to say that , uh ,
maybe this kid deserved it .
had it coming , you know ?
hold on . it &apos;s never okay to hit another student .
uh ... oh ... i don &apos;t know if i agree with you .
i mean , what if this kid was picking on her ?
and he started it , and she was just defending herself ?
i mean , how can you assume that just , out of the blue ,
she acted with malicious intent ?
i &apos;m sorry , are you a lawyer ?
no , no , no , no , i &apos;m a cop , you see .
and , uh , as a cop , we always , uh ,
we always think about motive , right ?
like when a girl who &apos;s never been in trouble gets straight a &apos;s ,
all of a sudden ends up in the principal &apos;s office ,
you got to think that there were maybe extenuating circumstances .
very well .
grace , would you care to explain to us
why you punched lucas banks so hard that he required
four stitches to stop the bleeding ?
i &apos;ve got no excuse .
i &apos;m sorry .
thank you .
i realize it &apos;s not easy to admit when you &apos;re wrong .
now , uh , the only thing left to discuss is your punishment .
suspended for a week .
you understand that &apos;s a big deal , right ?
you &apos;re aware of that ?
i know , danno . i &apos;m sorry .
what do you mean you &apos;re sorry ?
hold on . stop .
explain something to me , okay ?
because i know that you would never punch
some kid in the face for no reason .
so tell me what happened .
lucas was picking on my friend katie .
i told him to stop .
and when he didn &apos;t , you hit him ?
you said the only way to deal with bullies
is to stand up to them .
okay , that @-@ that &apos;s fine .
but why didn &apos;t you say something
when she asked you what happened ?
why didn &apos;t you speak up ?
because i &apos;m no rat .
you &apos;re @-@ you &apos;re no rat ?
who are you and what have you done with my daughter ?
listen to me : we will discuss this further later ,
but for now , you &apos;re grounded , you understand ?
detective williams .
i mean , i don &apos;t get it .
apparently , these days , the kids pledge of allegiance ,
it &apos;s to the mafia code of omerta , right ?
i mean , i have no idea what &apos;s gotten into her .
really ?
yes , really .
she reminds me of somebody else i know .
oh , yeah ? who &apos;s that ?
well , let &apos;s see . she &apos;s , uh , she &apos;s scrappy ,
stubborn , hotheaded , and loyal to a fault .
she &apos;s you , pal .
ah , that &apos;s disturbingly insightful .
maybe i was a little hard on her , no ?
i think so . come on .
lou , what do we know ?
our fugitive &apos;s name is roy parrish .
he ditched the van he escaped in .
he &apos;s been on the run for 37 minutes .
apb &apos;s gone out . we got birds in the air ,
we got the roadblocks set up within a 15 @-@ block radius .
hpd is performing car @-@ to @-@ car searches as we speak .
gentlemen , mr. parrish is a three @-@ striker .
so we &apos;re putting away the bean bags ,
and we going to the real thing .
because if this guy gets cornered ,
no way he &apos;s gonna surrender .
so , according to the prosecutors ,
roy parrish was running a real estate scam on rich marks
all across the country .
hmm . see ? there &apos;s another reason why i rent .
apparently , he was soliciting investments
on a honolulu land development that never existed .
one of the guys he conned got wise and flew in to confront him .
guessing that didn &apos;t work out so well for him .
parrish was arrested for the murder .
and since he was already being investigated by the fbi
for wire fraud , the case went federal . parrish got life .
breaks out during the sentencing hearing .
what about the cameras ? did they catch anything ?
the whole thing , thankfully .
you might not believe it otherwise .
check this out .
so parrish is being led to a prisoner transport when this happens .
you know , something tells me this isn &apos;t the first time
parrish has slipped a pair of cuffs .
he &apos;s been in and out of jail his whole life .
his last stint was 12 years for armed robbery .
he may have swapped the shotgun for a business suit ,
but clearly , he &apos;s still very dangerous .
hey , guys , so i just spoke with the prosecutor .
apparently , the feds had a star eyewitness .
it was a local construction guy
named archie akama who placed parrish at the murder scene .
now , during testimony ,
parrish threatened to kill this guy in open court .
it took three marshals to restrain him .
okay , get us akama &apos;s address .
we should go grab him
and get him into protective custody right away .
right . meantime , you guys reach out to parrish &apos;s people .
hit friends , family , former associates ,
anybody who could harbor a fugitive .
okay . he &apos;s got a daughter on the island .
kono and i will start there .
this guy parrish , he &apos;s sharp enough
to put together an elaborate real estate scam .
it &apos;s hard to imagine that he would risk going back to prison
just to take a shot at a witness .
i &apos;m guessing he &apos;s laying low ,
looking for a way off the island right now .
yeah , maybe . but he &apos;s not gonna last long without help , right ?
he &apos;ll have to surface sooner or later .
drive .
okay , here &apos;s how it &apos;s gonna go , big guy .
keep both your hands on that wheel
blondie , you go ahead and pass me back those guns .
i got a better idea . how about i send back some handcuffs ,
you put &apos; em on , nobody has to die , okay ?
you &apos;re the funny one , i guess .
guns ! pass &apos; em back , grip first .
come on ! give &apos; em to me .
clearly you haven &apos;t thought this through .
i mean , this entire place is locked down .
you &apos;re not getting out of here .
oh , we &apos;ll just have to see about that , won &apos;t we ?
trust me , all right ?
the only way this ends well for you
is if you surrender yourself right now .
i &apos;ll take that under advisement .
right now , all you gotta do is shut up and drive .
that &apos;s gonna be a problem .
all right , blondie , give me your phone .
that your daughter ?
i say is that your daughter ?
yeah .
what &apos;s her name ?
her name is grace .
hi , daddy .
no , honey , i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m not your daddy .
i &apos;m a good friend of your daddy &apos;s ,
and he asked me to call you
because there &apos;s a sound that he wants you to hear , okay ?
hold on .
now listen to me .
you don &apos;t make it through that checkpoint ,
she &apos;s gonna hear you die , you understand ?
danno ... ?
you nod your head if you understand .
danno , are you there ?
here it comes , honey . you just listen up .
danno ?
danno , are you there ? i &apos;cant hear you . daddy ?
grover .
lou , it &apos;s mcgarrett .
listen , our fugitive was just spotted .
where ?
a service station in wai &apos;anae .
we need all available resources up there
to start searching the area , okay ?
wait a minute ! that &apos;s halfway across the island !
i &apos;m not gonna abandon our perimeter on the hope
that this thing is real .
listen , this is solid , you understand ?
solid . one of chin ho &apos;s ci &apos;s called it in .
and the longer we waste time ,
the more time parrish has to slip away .
we need to boots on the ground up there right now !
did you hear me ? right now .
turn around , let &apos;s go ! let &apos;s go !
danno ?
okay , grace .
we &apos;re gonna have to try this again later .
bye .
see ...
what you can get accomplished if you put your mind to it ?
you didn &apos;t choose this car by accident , did you ?
no , i didn &apos;t .
okay , i assume , uh ,
you got everything figured out , so ...
you want to tell us what happens next ?
what happens next is this :
you &apos;re gonna handcuff your partner &apos;s wrist to that steering wheel .
then give me his phone .
looks like we &apos;re gonna be spending a little bit of time together .
those things are trackable .
so they got to go .
do it . come on .
you know what , parrish ?
clearly you &apos;re a smart guy .
i mean , getting out of the courthouse ,
and making it this far , that &apos;s impressive .
but here &apos;s something you might not know .
every single cop on the island right now is looking for you .
plus the tsa and the port authority have both been alerted ,
which means you show your face at the airport
or any of the docks , they &apos;re gonna be all over you .
and it &apos;s only a matter of time
before our team come looking for us .
so what i &apos;m saying to you is that with or without us ,
there is no way you &apos;re getting off this island .
but i &apos;m not running .
i got other plans .
we need some new wheels .
parrish isn &apos;t here .
and you are ?
agents kohl , denson , fbi .
lieutenant chin ho kelly from five @-@ o.
this is officer kono kalakaua .
yeah , parrish was our case .
we put in a better part of a year to get that conviction ,
just to have him skip on us during sentencing ,
so you know this is an epic disaster .
i got a federal prosecutor on my ass .
all right , well , our team &apos;s doing everything we can to bring parrish in .
good , we can use the help .
goes without saying he &apos;s one slippery son of a bitch .
so what &apos;d the daughter have to say ?
nothing helpful . maybe you guys &apos;ll have better luck with her .
look , it &apos;s like i already told the fbi .
my father hasn &apos;t been by here today
and he hasn &apos;t tried to contact me .
when was the last time you spoke with him ?
it &apos;s about a year ago .
he called the night he was arrested , swore he was innocent .
nothing since then ?
here .
your father sent you these from prison ?
at least two or three a week .
they &apos;re unopened .
didn &apos;t answer any of his collect calls , either .
that man &apos;s never been a father to me .
why should i be a daughter to him now ?
you &apos;re not curious what he has to say ?
no .
the man &apos;s a natural born liar .
you can &apos;t trust a word that comes out of his mouth .
you mind if we hold onto these ?
yeah , that &apos;s fine . i have no use for them .
petrie park , right ?
i used to go there with my dad when i was a kid .
sure that was nice .
look .
clearly there was a time when that man meant something to you .
otherwise you wouldn &apos;t have kept those letters .
so if he tries to contact you ,
tell him to turn himself in .
&apos;cause whatever you may think of him now ,
i know you don &apos;t want this to end badly for him .
aw , man .
is there a problem , officer ?
yeah , can you step out of the car ?
wait , are ... you even a cop ?
no , but , uh ,
they are .
what size pants you wear ?
like , 34 ?
all right , this is kauhi street .
what are we looking for ?
you &apos;ll know it when you see it .
make a right .
you figure it out yet ?
the eyewitness at your trial , archie akama .
he was a construction worker .
that it ?
that &apos;s right , smart guy .
how &apos;d you know where he was working ?
it &apos;s a funny thing about being in prison ...
some of the biggest crooks you &apos;re never gonna meet are in there .
the guards .
i paid one of them off to get me an address .
so , what , you &apos;re just gonna go in there and pull akama out ?
not me . that &apos;s what you &apos;re gonna do .
you &apos;re gonna walk right up to that foreman ,
show him that badge of yours ,
and you say whatever you got to say .
to get akama to come out and come back to the car with you .
you got it ?
i got it . is that it ?
yeah , that &apos;s it .
but know one thing :
i &apos;m gonna be watching .
you disappear on me for one second ,
i suspect you &apos;re gonna tip them off ,
your partner here is shot dead .
okay .
your little buddy has quite an attitude problem . doesn &apos;t he ?
yeah , when you point a gun in his face ,
it kind of brings out the worst in him , you know ?
yeah .
let &apos;s just hope he knows how to follow directions .
what happened ?
what &apos;d he say ?
according to the foreman ,
no one named akama works here .
you expect me to believe that ?
what , do you think i &apos;m an idiot ?
you can believe what you want .
that &apos;s what he said , okay ?
maybe you &apos;re not taking into consideration the fact that this guard ,
the guy that gave you the address , maybe he played you , okay ?
he played me ?
now i &apos;m getting played by guards .
don &apos;t try to get inside my head , okay ?
who &apos;s he talking to ?
what &apos;d you say to him ?
i didn &apos;t say anything .
you told him to call the cops , didn &apos;t you ?
i didn &apos;t tell him anything .
get out of here . come on , drive .
wh @-@ where ?
anyplace , just out of here .
you &apos;re not thinking straight , roy , okay ? listen to me .
getting revenge against the guy who testified against you
is not gonna change anything .
what are you talking about ?
you think i want him dead ?
archie akama &apos;s the last guy in the world i want dead .
then why are you looking for him ?
he &apos;s the only one that can clear my name .
now drive !
okay , do me a favor . explain something to me .
how is it that the same guy that testified against you
is now gonna be the same guy that clears your name ? hmm ?
i want to get him to recant his testimony .
oh , right . with a gun to his head , i &apos;m sure he &apos;s gonna ...
admit to anything you want him to .
maybe he &apos;ll say he &apos;s santa claus or something .
the only way i &apos;m ever gonna prove i &apos;m innocent
is to have him admit that he lied under oath .
wait a minute . why would he perjure himself
just to get you convicted ?
because the whole thing was a massive frame @-@ up from the get @-@ go .
stop . back it up .
okay . what happened ? tell us what happened from the beginning .
listen , after my last little bit ,
i promised i was never gonna go up again .
i needed a job ,
i answered an ad in the newspaper for a sales job ,
and i took it .
i didn &apos;t know the whole damn thing was just a scam .
they were just looking for some mope with a record
to pin the whole thing on .
who &apos;s &quot; they &quot; ?
dale sullivan . he &apos;s the one that gave me the job .
the one i went to when one of the investors
was making big noise about the frame @-@ up .
why didn &apos;t you go to the police ?
sullivan said it was all a misunderstanding .
the next thing i know , the feds are kicking my door down ,
the investor &apos;s shot in the head
and they got an eyewitness on the scene .
archie akama .
paid off , no doubt .
if that ain &apos;t enough ,
they planted the murder weapon in my place , okay ?
soon as i saw that ,
i knew it was sullivan from the get .
they made sure all the contracts had my signature ,
they ran the cash through an account he opened in my name .
you add that up with the murder weapon and the eyewitness ,
it was just the final nail .
what &apos;d the feds say when you told &apos; em all that ?
the same thing the two of you are thinking right now ,
that i &apos;m lying .
so , did they look into sullivan ?
they said he didn &apos;t exist .
by the time i got arrested , he was already out of the picture .
i &apos;ll tell you one thing , that little rat akama ,
he &apos;s still out there somewhere , and i &apos;m gonna find him .
okay , um , well , let &apos;s @-@ let &apos;s say you do find him ,
let &apos;s say you &apos;re telling the truth ,
you put a gun to this guy &apos;s head , uh ,
and you get a confession out of him ,
it &apos;s not gonna help you , okay ?
i mean , he would &apos;ve been under duress , and it &apos;ll never stick .
why do you think i picked your car ?
word is five @-@ o are the only cops
that will give a guy like me a fair shake .
yeah , well , you know , our goodwill usually runs out when someone ...
jacks our car and puts a gun to our heads .
it &apos;s the only way you were ever gonna believe me .
you heard it from akama &apos;s own mouth that he perjured himself .
you find out that sullivan put him up to the whole damn thing .
listen , stick with me and help me track him down .
and if you do , you &apos;ll find out i &apos;m telling the truth .
there &apos;s only one problem with that .
akama &apos;s address was on those cell phones you smashed .
steve , it &apos;s me again .
listen , i &apos;ve got an update for you ,
so give me a call when you get this .
i tracked down a bunch of parrish &apos;s old associates .
they swear they haven &apos;t heard from parrish in years .
see , that &apos;s interesting .
kono and i went through the letters
he wrote to his daughter while he was in prison .
parrish swears that he &apos;d gone straight .
he claims that a guy named dale sullivan set him up
for both the embezzlement and the murder .
okay , didn &apos;t his own daughter herself say
that he &apos;s a skilled liar ?
if she doesn &apos;t believe him , why should we ?
right . except for the fact that one of the leads
he asked her to look into actually turned up something .
take a look at this .
it &apos;s an online job posting that parrish claims he answered .
it actually expired a little while ago ,
but i was able to dig up a cached copy .
now , according to him , this guy sullivan
interviewed him and then hired him for a sales job .
&quot; lucrative commissions . no experience necessary . &quot;
thin on details , right ?
and the e @-@ mail address for responses is anonymous .
i checked with the web site and according to their records ,
52 people responded to this ad .
and parrish was one of them .
then we need to contact every
single person who responded to this ad .
kono &apos;s with hpd right now , doing exactly that .
let &apos;s suppose for a second that parrish really was framed .
i mean , if you &apos;re looking for a fall guy ,
he certainly fits the bill , right ?
two @-@ time felon .
no one &apos;s gonna think twice about throwing the book at him .
it would also explain
why none of his old crew have heard from him .
maybe he really did clean up his act .
you know , if parrish really was framed ,
archie akama lied under oath .
i &apos;m still waiting to hear whether the guys picked akama up .
when i tried them earlier , they weren &apos;t answering .
i tried steve three times in the last hour .
it keeps going to voicemail .
is that them ?
no , it &apos;s grover .
lou , what &apos;s going on ?
what is going on is
we just canvassed all of wai &apos;anae .
there &apos;s no sign of parrish ...
if he was even here to begin with .
you need to get yourself another ci .
wait a minute . what ci ?
that ci of yours who said he spotted parrish .
mcgarrett called into me a couple of hours ago .
i haven &apos;t been able to get a hold of him ever since .
i never called mcgarrett about a ci .
well , so why would he lie to me ?
there &apos;s only one reason why he &apos;d lie to you .
steve and danny are in trouble .
okay , we are officially driving around in circles . what &apos;s next ?
i &apos;m thinking .
well , think faster .
&apos;cause we &apos;re gonna run out of gas .
roy , it &apos;s time to face the facts .
you &apos;re out of options , okay ?
i mean , you can &apos;t keep running ,
and you can &apos;t find akama by yourself .
i could still shoot you both and take the car .
yeah , that would prove
everything you just said is a lie .
now , if you want to clear your name ,
if that &apos;s what you want to do ,
there &apos;s only one way to do it .
how &apos;s that ?
yeah , how is that ?
you let us take you in .
we track down akama ,
sort out what &apos;s going on .
no feds , no hpd .
just you and us and akama in a room .
what , no catered lunch ?
this offer is genuine , okay ?
it &apos;s the only offer you &apos;re gonna get .
you have my word , i promise .
if akama is lying ,
we will get it out of him .
you came to us for a fair shake .
you gonna let us give you one or what ?
okay , all right .
i &apos;ll do it your way .
clear !
clear .
help ! help me !
help me ! help !
thank god !
some lunatic stole my car .
what kind of car , exactly ?
you know , i gotta , uh ...
i gotta ask a question .
you are a three @-@ time felon .
guys like you do not get out of the joint
and , uh , get jobs selling real estate to rich investors .
not legitimately , anyway .
so you didn &apos;t kill anybody , fine .
but , uh , you must &apos;ve known
that what you were doing was not on the up and up .
how old &apos;s your daughter ?
eleven ?
twelve ?
where were you when she was born ?
i bet you were right there .
you probably held her in your arms
and heard her first little cry .
wouldn &apos;t be surprised if you cut the cord .
you probably did , didn &apos;t you ?
you know where i was ?
no .
max seg , otter creek ,
wheelwright , kentucky .
by the time i was released ,
my little girl was already six years old .
with my record ...
i was lucky if i could see her
a couple hours every weekend .
i &apos;d take her to the park
and push her on a swing
and buy a shaved ice .
you know what that &apos;s like ?
i was there every saturday , no matter what ,
until i ...
till i went up again .
the years kept piling up , one after another .
by the time i got out ,
she wasn &apos;t a little girl anymore .
already made up her mind what kind of man i was .
i figured that new job i had was my chance
to make a little bit of money .
maybe put her in college ,
do something right for once in my life .
no .
you guys go ahead and believe whatever you want to .
when did you tip them off ?
right after you gave me your word ? !
nobody tipped anybody off , roy .
i told you our team
would come looking for us , didn &apos;t i tell you that ?
lose them ! now !
do you hear me ?
now your turn . put &apos; em on , nice and tight .
back up . put &apos; em on .
lean back . sit back .
buddy , just so you know ,
uh , the brake &apos;s the square pedal on the left .
i &apos;m aware of that .
okay , so what are you doing ?
whatever you &apos;re doing , don &apos;t do it , please .
listen to me , danny . guilty guys-- they run .
they don &apos;t kidnap a couple of cops to prove they were framed .
okay , good . so we drop him off at hpd ,
and then we look into the story ourselves .
do not ... without ...
no , we don &apos;t .
no , we don &apos;t ?
no , we don &apos;t . no , we don &apos;t .
why don &apos;t we ?
gave him our word
we would track down akama before we turn him over to the cops .
all right , that &apos;s what we &apos;re gonna do .
sit back . sit back .
39 olive avenue , wahiawa .
what is that ?
that is akama &apos;s address , okay ?
the foreman did not say that he wasn &apos;t working .
he said he wasn &apos;t working today . okay ?
oh , don &apos;t ... look , don &apos;t give me a look , okay ?
i did the hard part . all you got to do now
is outrun the cops .
buckle up .
how ?
hold on .
they did what ? !
mcgarrett just evaded hpd .
now , officers on the scene say they saw detective williams
with his gun on the fugitive .
which begs the question-- what the hell is going on ? !
i &apos;m not sure .
but i may have an idea of where they &apos;re going .
i &apos;m on my way .
hey , take it easy .
nice and slow .
i don &apos;t trust you in these bracelets , either .
come on . let &apos;s go see
what archie akama has to say . turn around .
hold on .
door &apos;s open .
you stay with him .
i &apos;m going in .
i got him .
it &apos;s all over . that &apos;s it .
i &apos;ll call it in .
no dial tone .
get down !
get down !
stay down !
i &apos;m staying down !
not you . him .
i got bullets flying over my head ! huh ?
nice entrance .
why is it everywhere you go , people are shooting at you ?
today , they weren &apos;t gunning for me , okay ?
where &apos;s parrish ?
we got separated during the gunfight .
he ain &apos;t here . he &apos;s gone .
oh , thank god .
you okay ? yeah , i &apos;m fine .
i &apos;m fine , too .
glad to see you guys in one piece .
any word on parrish ?
no . hpd is canvassing the neighborhood right now .
okay , so , what happened ?
split up at the courthouse to go find parrish .
turns out , he was in our car . my car .
and , um , uh , he &apos;s innocent , also .
the feds convicted the wrong guy .
this man dale sullivan-- he , uh ... he framed parrish
for the murder . he also paid off akama
to lie under oath .
that much we know .
we got kono running down a lead right now .
hopefully , she can tell us who this sullivan guy really is .
well , whoever he is ,
i &apos;m thinking that he found out parrish escaped ,
came here to kill akama to make sure
he didn &apos;t recant his testimony .
right . then he sat on the house ,
hoping that parrish would come back here .
we need to i.d. these shooters asap .
all right ?
on it .
no sign of parrish .
lady next door had her car stolen .
found these in the driveway .
all right , let &apos;s get the plate number out .
make sure hpd keeps close eyes on parrish &apos;s daughter .
he &apos;s on his own now . he may turn to her . yeah .
let &apos;s get photos and prints of all these dead bodies .
we need to get csu started on running i.d. &apos; s .
let &apos;s take a look .
kono , what do you got ?
so far we tracked down 12 people who responded to the job post .
three of them have criminal records .
now coincidentally , those same three are
the only ones who were called in for a job interview
with a man named dale sullivan .
they were being screened-- sullivan was
looking for someone with a record
to pin the crime on .
that &apos;s not all . so based on the descriptions ,
i had hpd put together a composite sketch of sullivan .
chin , you &apos;re never gonna believe this ,
but we met this guy , today .
the fbi agent from this morning .
yeah , agent kohl . how &apos;d you know that ?
i &apos;m standing over his partner &apos;s body right now .
parrish isn &apos;t here .
you are ... ?
agent kohl .
our fake fed is julian lynch .
arrested back in 2008 for securities fraud ,
but investigators couldn &apos;t make the charges stick .
seems like this guy has a knack
for staying one step removed from the cons he runs .
yeah , by setting other people up to take the fall .
look-- according to tsa , lynch arrived
in hawaii back in december of 2012 .
that &apos;s three weeks before parrish responded to the job posting .
right . that &apos;s when parrish became lynch &apos;s patsy .
did you say &quot; patsy &quot; ?
i did . i &apos;ve been wanting to use that word for a while .
you know , if lynch is bold enough
to pose as an fbi agent to track this guy down ,
he &apos;s not gonna stop now just because the heat &apos;s turned up .
right . that &apos;s why we need to find parrish before he does .
mcgarrett .
the hpd unit we put on parrish &apos;s daughter
just called in to say she &apos;s leaving her house .
is he still tailing her ?
he was ,
and then 15 minutes ago he stopped answering his radio .
lauren .
thanks for meeting me here .
listen , i gotta ...
disappear for a while .
but before i do , there &apos;s ...
something i wanted you to know .
never killed that man .
guess i never gave you much reason to believe me ,
but you gotta believe me now .
please say you do .
you shouldn &apos;t have run .
what &apos;d you do ?
in her defense , she thought i was fbi .
wait , what &apos;s going on ?
what &apos;s going on is , probably for the first time in his life ,
your father &apos;s telling the truth .
listen , do whatever you got to do ,
but let my daughter go .
maybe .
we &apos;ll see .
you know , it didn &apos;t have to go this way .
you could &apos;ve just lived the rest of your life in prison .
for a crime i didn &apos;t commit ?
does that really matter ?
i mean , come on , no offense , but a guy like you ,
sooner or later , you were gonna end up back there .
please don &apos;t do this .
sorry , hon , i can &apos;t be constantly
looking over my shoulder , wondering if and when
daddy here is gonna pop up and get his revenge .
officer down .
he &apos;s gone .
this one belongs to lauren parrish .
he must have tailed her here .
there &apos;s a lookout about a half mile down through those woods .
that &apos;s got to be where they are . let &apos;s go . come on .
i &apos;m so sorry , dad .
please stop crying .
you &apos;re the only good thing that ever came out of me .
let &apos;s face it ...
i &apos;ve made enough mistakes for ... two lifetimes .
it &apos;s not your fault .
listen , this is between you and me .
she doesn &apos;t need to see ...
daddy !
daddy ? daddy ...
you son of a bitch !
d ... daddy ...
kill her , and dump &apos; em both .
daddy ...
daddy ...
okay , why don &apos;t you come with us .
daddy ...
let &apos;s give them some space to work , okay ? come on .
i got to get pressure on this wound .
this is 3901 to central .
i got a male gsw , critical condition .
i need a 10 @-@ 10 expedited to my location .
stay with us , roy .
his pulse is fading .
chin . send her over .
lauren , come here .
come here . keep your hands here .
give me your hand . he can hear you , okay ?
you talk to him . talk to him .
i believe you .
i believe you .
i believe you .
i love you . i always have .
lauren parrish , on behalf of the united states
district court of hawaii , i would like to apologize
for the gross miscarriage of justice that resulted
in your father &apos;s wrongful conviction .
it will never bring him back ,
but the record will now show that randall parrish
was posthumously pardoned of all charges .
thank you for coming .
figured you might want these back .
i &apos;m still holding out hope that
one day you &apos;ll read these letters .
because my biggest fear
isn &apos;t that i &apos;ll spend the rest of my life in prison
for a crime i didn &apos;t do ,
it &apos;s that i &apos;ll die in here without getting the chance
to tell you how proud i am of you ...
and how much you mean to me .
the time we spent together
were the happiest moments of my life .
and i want you to know that there &apos;s nothing
that &apos;s made me happier than being your daddy .
i don &apos;t get it ; i thought i was grounded .
i had some time to think about it , and , uh ...
i realized i was maybe a little bit too hard on you , okay ?
you were ?
yes . i was .
listen , um ... i want you to know something .
i am very proud of you , you know ,
for sticking up for your friend .
i &apos;m sorry i didn &apos;t say that yesterday . all right ?
you know , i make mistakes , too , sometimes .
i don &apos;t always know what the right thing to do is .
but i always ... i always love you ,
no matter what , all right ?
come here . you &apos;re the best .
hey , look who made it .
hey , grace , i got a seat right here for you .
yeah , sit down , guys .
help us finish off these pu @-@ pu &apos;s .
yeah , i don &apos;t , uh , think
that sounds right to me , still , to this day .
whoa ! that is some serious bruising you got there .
you should see the other guy .
okay , i &apos;m gonna go get another round .
danny , come for a walk .
do you need me to pay for it ?
no , i &apos;ve got catherine &apos;s amex .
oh , nice . be right back .

i was just trying to convince the guys
we should hit the pool for a little dip .
all right , come on , now , we got food here ,
people trying to eat-- don &apos;t nobody want to see all that .
you &apos;re just chickening out of the belly flop contest
i challenged you to .
that sounds fun .

hey , uh , can i have three more of these , please ?
and , uh , what are you drinking ?
