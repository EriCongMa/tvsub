&quot; bend and break &quot;
uncontrollable bleeding .
acidosis .
cold .
we all know what the combination means
we call it the trait of death .
the point of no return .
we &apos;ve been talking about having another baby for months !
we were excited ! we were discussing freaking names !
why would you do that -- just to get my hopes up ?
you &apos;re attacking me for something
that i never even said !
you didn &apos;t have to say anything !
it &apos;s clear from everything
that you do that you don &apos;t want this .
why start training all over again ?
you &apos;re an amazing pediatric surgeon .
people cross the country just to have you operate on their kids .
for the last time ,
this fellowship is advancing my career , which is --
which is not advancing this family !
it &apos;s the moment in the o.r.
when you turn to damage control .
callie , actually , if i could stop you there ,
i &apos;m interested to hear the rest of arizona &apos;s sentence .
arizona , you were going to say ... ?
you stop .
you step back .
you let the body rest and see if you can find a solution ...
to the chaos that &apos;s happening inside .
courtney , you &apos;re doing great .
clamp .
is she okay ? tell me she &apos;s okay .
are you kidding ? she &apos;s absolutely beautiful .
isn &apos;t that right , robbins ?
she &apos;s so beautiful .
we &apos;re just gonna check her out and get her a little oxygen .
lap pads .
all right , the placenta , robbins .
yeah , i got it .
uh , hey , alex , how are her sats ?
below 90 , but improving with bagging .
all right , let &apos;s get her ready to go .
robbins , the baby is no longer your patient .
pay attention here .
arizona , you ready ?
i love when you talk to a patient
and it &apos;s like they &apos;re the only person in the whole world .
i love , um , you bite your lip just a teeny bit --
it &apos;s barely noticeable -- when you study scans ,
and i find it really sexy .
i love when you do the voices
when you read to sofia at night and make her laugh
and i could listen to that sound all day ...
for the rest of my life .
and you smile when you sleep --
like , big , like , crazy @-@ big .
and i love that when i wake up ,
that &apos;s the first thing i see .
uh , and i love --
see , why -- why don &apos;t you just -- god .
callie , do you want to talk about
how arizona &apos;s words make you feel ?
um , well , it &apos;s just -- i just -- i -- i --
if you &apos;d say this stuff out loud once in a while .
i would if you &apos;d let me .
wait , what ?
i was just saying them right now ,
and then you cut me off ,
i mean , you &apos;re too busy trying to speak for me --
okay , remember the language
we talked about using with each other .
i feel that you &apos;re always cutting --
well , i feel that you &apos;re constantly accusing me of this --
i feel that you just did that again .
she just did it again !
let &apos;s try again .
callie , i feel , uh ,
that you should go with a primary repair .
eh , i feel the artery &apos;s missing too large a piece .
we &apos;ll do an interposition graft .
w-- you agreed with me in pre @-@ op .
yeah , well , i changed my mind once i got in here
and saw the extent of the defect .
um , finished ligating the bleeders ,
so we &apos;re all set up here .
yeah , and i don &apos;t see any more bone fragments , dr. torres , so --
when you so quickly disregard my medical opinion ,
it makes me feel like you forget that i &apos;m a pediatric surgeon
who knows that interpositional grafts
can cause complications in children .
well , when you question me in the o.r. ,
it makes me feel like you don &apos;t think i can do my job .
we &apos;ll use a ptfe graft , wilson .
use the great saphenous vein , wilson .
we don &apos;t need any synthetic materials .
okay , fine , cut into the kid &apos;s leg .
it &apos;s not about the leg
it was never about the -- it goes way before the leg .
four years ago , i received the grant of a lifetime .
going to africa , working in that clinic --
that was an opportunity that i never thought that i would get .
you followed your dream . you went .
but you were supposed to go with me ,
and you were miserable
and letting everyone know about it .
and so i went . i went without you ,
and then i came back -- for you .
i came back for you .
and when i came back , you were -- - pregnant ?
i &apos;m bisexual .
i &apos;m attracted to both men and women , and it freaks her out .
yes , i slept with mark . i got pregnant .
i was pregnant . and ?
and i had no time to process it .
i was so in love with you ,
i just wanted to be with you , no matter what .
and i @-@ if in order to be with you --
if you &apos;re about to say what i think you &apos;re about to say --
let me get a word in , callie !
i trapped you into a kid ,
a kid you never wanted , and now you &apos;re stuck .
don &apos;t you ever say
that i don &apos;t love my child or that i regret my child !
i regret that you made a decision for me !
you make all the choices !
and every time that i try to make a decision for myself ,
it &apos;s like you make me feel like
the worst , most selfish person in the whole world !
i &apos;m sorry . did i make you feel selfish
when you decided to sleep with another woman ?
i &apos;m so sorry .
that &apos;s not what i meant ,
and you know that &apos;s not what i meant .
i meant that anytime that i try and do something for myself ,
you -- you -- j--
callie , the session &apos;s not done yet .
it feels pretty done .
no !
that &apos;s the stupidest idea i &apos;ve ever heard .
it is not a stupid idea . she didn &apos;t mean &quot; stupid . &quot;
she just said the word &quot; stupid , &quot; so --
you &apos;re talking about spending
a large portion of my grant money
on a complicated staged facial reconstruction
for one patient .
so , what , you want to just reject him ?
no , we find a way to help him that &apos;s less stupid !
okay , i &apos;m gonna grab lunch .
hunt , find me later .
what &apos;s going on , huh ?
it &apos;s just i keep giving and giving and giving .
you &apos;re giving me things i didn &apos;t ask for , callie .
that is not true !
all i &apos;ve done is everything that you &apos;ve asked me to do .
you asked me to not leave you after the plane crash . i didn &apos;t .
you wanted me to stay after you cheated on me . i did .
then you wanted a house . we got it .
i do everything for you , arizona ,
because i love you .
i love you , too !
well , and now we &apos;re here , and i want something ,
and you can &apos;t give it to me . you won &apos;t give it to me .
i never said that i didn &apos;t want a baby !
the whole reason that we &apos;re here
is because of you and what you want .
i am trying to give you what you want ,
but you make it so hard .
why can &apos;t you commit to anything ?
i &apos;ve committed the past five years of my life to you .
we &apos;re ... not getting anywhere .
we &apos;ve circled right back to where we started .
it may be time to hit the reset button .
great . let &apos;s -- let &apos;s reset .
how ?
have you ever considered spending some time apart ?
because a break can actually --
you mean a separation ? no .
we &apos;re trying to save our marriage , not destroy it .
i don &apos;t want to do that .
let her finish .
don &apos;t think of it as a separation .
you two have gone through so much .
you &apos;re completely different people
than when you first got together .
it can be helpful to rediscover who you are .
take a break from one another .
break , separation -- it &apos;s the same thing .
it &apos;s the first step to divorce .
is this what you want ? is this what you -- - let her finish .
look , in my experience , couples come to therapy
for one of two reasons .
either one person wants out of the relationship
and they need help telling the other ,
or they both desperately want to make it work .
they want to fight to make it work .
well , we want to make it work , right ?
right . right .
and a break is not an end .
a break is a tool to help make it work ,
for an agreed @-@ upon time ,
and then we come together , re @-@ evaluate the relationship .
no . i don &apos;t like it . i don &apos;t -- no .
i think it &apos;s crazy . i &apos;m sorry , i do .
i @-@ i mean , we &apos;re supposed to be getting closer ,
so , what , we need more space ?
no , we need more time together ,
not apart .
that &apos;s how you make things work , right ?
no break , right ?
i think we should take a break .
how long -- how long will the break last ?
as long as you &apos;d like . we decide that now .
okay . um ... 30 days ?
30 days ? a month ?
you need a break from me for a whole month ?
arizona , you want to say something , now is the time .
callie , i was trying to be nice .
i @-@ i don &apos;t even think that that &apos;d be enough .
i mean , if i thought you &apos;d go for it ,
maybe three months , six months .
oh -- oh , my god . six months ?
i &apos;m trying to be honest .
i want to save us , but the only way that i know
how to do this is by being honest .
this feels like a joke .
or a reality show .
&quot; real lesbian housewives m.d. of seattle . &quot;
fine , 30 days . how does it work ?
you have a child , so for her sake ,
you two will live in the house as parents ,
but with separate lives , separate rooms .
boundaries are vital .
make a schedule for child @-@ care responsibilities ,
and stick to it .
no talking ,
no communication , except in emergencies .
lastly -- this is important ...
no intimacy , no sex ,
with other people or with each other .
sofia &apos;s getting dressed .
she also seems to be continuing
the purple theme she &apos;s got going on this week .
arizona , i didn &apos;t sleep at all .
i can &apos;t do this .
it &apos;s been one night , and , um ...
i feel we don &apos;t need this .
how are we seriously supposed to not talk for an entire month ?
just -- please , just please look at me . i need to talk .
emily , i &apos;m sorry . i know it hurts .
hurts like a bitch . yeah , meds will kick in soon .
you got your arm caught in what , again ?
a noodle @-@ making machine .
it &apos;s the dumbest job ever , but it just pays well ,
and i &apos;m trying to get into culinary school ,
which is freaking expensive .
looks like comminuted , displaced ,
mid @-@ shaft radius and ulna fractures .
yep .
well , emily ,
unfortunately , your arm definitely needs surgery .
now , in order to stabilize the fracture ,
i will most likely need to put in a plate and some screws .
uh , edwards , call up to the o.r.
how long will it take to heal ?
i need my arm in shape to cook , to train for school .
applications are due in a month .
well , obviously , it &apos;s a pretty bad fracture ,
but we will fix you up .
we will get you into p.t. as soon as we can ,
and you will be back at it before you know it , okay ?
all right .
lee franklin , one day old ,
diagnosed with esophageal atresia at birth .
which means that his esophagus
developed in two separate pieces .
i &apos;m sorry , but i thought you said you could fix the gap .
when is that gonna happen ?
well , unfortunately , lee &apos;s images show
a longer gap than we predicted .
it &apos;s measuring around four centimeters , which prevents us
from simply sewing the two ends back together .
dr. karev can still operate .
it just makes the surgery a little bit more complicated .
wilson ?
we &apos;ll attach sutures to both ends of lee &apos;s esophagus ,
threading them out through incisions in his back .
every day , we &apos;ll pull on the sutures ,
thereby stretching the ends inside toward each other
in order to connect them in a later surgery .
however , for the procedure to work ,
we &apos;ll need lee to remain extremely still ,
so we &apos;ll need to put him in a medically induced coma .
i @-@ i &apos;m sorry , but , dr. robbins ,
but w @-@ why aren &apos;t you doing the surgery ?
dr. karev is now the attending on this case .
i have recently started a new specialty
in a different department .
but i can assure you ,
i trained dr. karev , and he is awesome .
y @-@ you have to put our baby into a coma ?
for how long ?
this process could take ... weeks .
there are other surgical options i &apos;d love to go over --
but this is the best one for lee .
dr. robbins , can i see you outside ?
what was that ?
you &apos;re just gonna make them worry .
i was thinking of doing a colonic interposition .
i fix the kid in one surgery , he can go home sooner .
no , using the native esophagus is better .
it &apos;s a prolonged hospital stay , but --
we could have him in a coma for weeks , maybe months .
i mean , that &apos;ll put the parents through hell .
using the colon has increased risks of stricture ,
anastomotic leaks , gred .
i mean , it &apos;s not fun to watch your kid go through that , either .
are you gonna let me do my job ,
or are you gonna do it for me the whole time ?
oh , crap , i &apos;m late for rounds .
okay , listen , just do it my way , okay ?
fine , only because he was once your patient
and because you &apos;re having trouble cutting the strings .
yeah , or because you know that i &apos;m right .
here you go , doctor .
thanks .
i sent your husband down to the gift shop .
he fainted last time we talked about needles .
oh , he &apos;s such a lightweight .
well , hopefully , he &apos;s buying you some chocolate .
you &apos;re late .
i &apos;m so sorry . uh , i was checking on a baby in the nicu --
don &apos;t care . graham , start talking .
jaclyn werlein , 23 weeks along .
recent fetal echo of her baby &apos;s heart
unfortunately confirmed critical aortic stenosis .
today , we &apos;ll be performing a fetal aortic valvuloplasty
in order to open up the narrowed aortic valve .
your b.p is a little high . you feeling okay ?
i &apos;m a little nervous .
the idea of a giant needle going through me
and then my baby &apos;s teeny heart ...
there doesn &apos;t seem to be much room for error .
dr. herman has made us the go @-@ to hospital
for fetal cardiac intervention .
she is the only surgeon who even does this procedure in the pacific northwest .
she &apos;s why i &apos;m here ... to learn from her .
jaclyn , i &apos;m not even going to insert the needle
until i &apos;m sure your baby &apos;s in the precise position that he needs to be .
okay .
position is critical to success .
if the fetus isn &apos;t facing forward , chest up ,
we can &apos;t get to the apex of the heart .
perfect approach , graham .
we have direct access now .
i &apos;ve been practicing in the lab .
dr. herman , i &apos;d be happy to assist .
graham is assisting on this one . watch . take notes .
i &apos;ve performed dozens of percutaneous procedures on babies .
were the babies still in utero ?
did they have hearts the size of a walnut ?
no . no , but ...
well , that &apos;s not the same , then , is it ?
robbins , you have an impeccable record as a pediatric surgeon .
as a fetal surgeon , big , fat zero .
i suggest you pay close attention to graham &apos;s hands ,
and next time , you can assist .
well , dr. herman , my hands are only trying to emulate yours .
graham , one more word , we &apos;re gonna go over to plastics
and have your lips surgically removed from my ass .
now , shut up , everyone . i &apos;m deploying the balloon .
oh , in case you &apos;re interested ,
there &apos;s a model you can practice on in the skills lab .
it &apos;s old , and the rubber &apos;s hardened ,
and it smells gross , but have fun .
thanks .
it took me about two months to nail it .
good luck .
oh , edwards , hey .
um , are you still on callie &apos;s service ?
no , this is the fourth time that she has switched sofia duty on me .
she said she had to practice .
you tell her that her daughter &apos;s asking
when she &apos;s gonna tuck her in at night ,
and remind her that we share custody
in this stupid arrangement .
okay , this really isn &apos;t something
that i feel comfortable
get out , edwards .
oh , sorry .
you were saying , uh , thyroid cancer ?
patient is david lasher .
i did a thyroidectomy on him ,
and since then , he has been cancer @-@ free ,
but this morning , he came in complaining of hip pain ,
so i did a pet scan , and ...
bone mets to the hip .
is there any way to resect this
without doing a total hip replacement ?
no , it looks like it involves too much of the proximal femur .
how old is david ?
33 , two kids and a wife .
how long will a replacement last ?
uh , 10 , 15 years .
so he &apos;ll need another one eventually .
well , yeah , but we either resect it and do a total hip now ,
or his cancer continues to spread , and he dies .
well , it looks like i &apos;m scheduling a hip replacement .
yeah . oh , no .
don &apos;t -- don &apos;t schedule it now . i have a ..
a kid to pick up .
and you have to keep on a smile on your face
despite your spouse barely speaking to you .
totally get that .
good night .
sweet dreams .
i had to look at so many places to find this , but i did .
hey , callie .
are we too loud for sofia ?
no , i just put her down . i thought y ...
i thought arizona had to study .
right , uh , talking is against the rules .
sorry . yes , arizona is studying .
i am helping her make jello moms to practice on .
the jello is the uterus ,
and the grapes -- tiny , little baby hearts .
it &apos;s the perfect surgical model .
you go in right here , and ...
neat .
i &apos;m also making ambrosia salad --
kepner family recipe .
so , then what did you do ?
i followed the rules .
your rules , by the way ... they suck .
okay , almost there .
just move the baby &apos;s left shoulder down , down .
okay . that &apos;s good . congratulations , robbins .
that was the fastest i &apos;ve ever seen anyone
flip a fetus into position .
thank you , dr. herman .
so , once we get the needle in ,
you want to do the rest of the procedure ?
yes .
but i &apos;m not ... i &apos;m not sure i should .
i &apos;ve only practiced a couple times in the skills lab ,
and i @-@ i don &apos;t know if i &apos;m there yet .
well , i &apos;m happy to assist if she &apos;s not ready .
graham , i want you to take special note of what robbins did there .
oh , yes , ma &apos;am .
i @-@ i @-@ i saw it .
that &apos;s what being an experienced surgeon gains you ...
the wisdom to know your limitations .
she &apos;s not gonna let her own arrogance
get in the way of patient care .
good call , robbins .
nice work , guys .
robbins , you &apos;ll take the lead on the next one . be ready .
of course , dr. herman .
yes !
oh , emily , i need you to remain still .
i thought the surgery was supposed to fix it !
it still hurts , almost worse than when it got caught !
okay , well , you &apos;re a little over a week post @-@ op , emily .
it &apos;s still gonna hurt from time to time . edwards , labs ?
her blood work &apos;s completely normal .
uh , the incision looks good ...
no sign of infection , no compartment syndrome .
i can &apos;t sleep . i can &apos;t eat . oh !
i get these shocks like two or three times a minute ,
and i -- i can &apos;t do it , dr. torres .
emily , i am so sorry . i @-@ i &apos;ve run every test .
nothing &apos;s coming up .
i &apos;m not sure what i can do .
something !
you got to do something to help me .
i can &apos;t live like this .
if i had known it was gonna be like this ...
please .
sorry .
you &apos;re good ? you okay ?
am i good ?
i am obviously not good . i &apos;m obviously not okay .
why would you ask that if you already know the answer ?
why not try , &quot; what is it , callie ? &quot;
&quot; what can i do , callie , &quot; like a human person ?
sorry . i have my own stuff .
no , i &apos;m s ..
i &apos;m sorry . it &apos;s my fault .
i just ... i have no one to talk to .
you on call right now ?
no , why ?
two more .
alright .
it &apos;s called an in @-@ home separation .
we live in the same house .
we trade off caring for sofia .
we just can &apos;t talk or have sex .
exactly what derek and i are doing , only healthy .
oh . well , cheers to that .
good man in the storm .
what &apos;s so &quot; good man in the storm &quot; about a break ?
&quot; how was your day , meredith ?
&quot; did you cure death today , meredith ?
when are you gonna cure death , meredith ? &quot;
oh , god .
&quot; i could have cured death
if you let me move to d.c. and work for the president . &quot;
so i &apos;m bisexual ! so what ?
it &apos;s a thing , and it &apos;s real .
i mean it &apos;s called lgbtq for a reason .
there &apos;s a &quot; b &quot; in there ,
and it doesn &apos;t mean &quot; badass . &quot;
okay , it kind of does , but it also means bi .
my mom and the chief were doing it all over the hospital .
all over the hospital ,
like me and derek -- cheating on addison .
i &apos;m a legacy cheater .
maybe sofia will be a legacy cheater .
everyone in this hospital &apos;s cheated on me .
every single person i have ever married has cheated on me --
all , uh , two of them ?
yeah .
come on .
cristina was the third rail in our marriage --
dangerous , fully charged , could kill us ,
but necessary for us to keep going .
she got me .
you think it &apos;s possible
that my one true love in my life is a girl ?
did you get excited by her vagina ?
no .
then no .
good point .
* vagina *
* va @-@ va @-@ vagina * * vagina *
sing it .
* va @-@ va @-@ vagina *
* vagi @-@ na @-@ ha *
it &apos;s a weird word .
i think it sounds pretty .
people should say it more .
oh , god , i miss sex .
i &apos;m hot . my husband &apos;s an idiot .
do it .
that might come back up .
so , you broke the rules .
no . no , we stopped .
we didn &apos;t have sex .
we j-- we just -- we kissed and ,
uh , somehow stopped .
i mean , she &apos;d had that big surgery with dr. herman that day ,
and all i wanted to do was ask her how it went .
we didn &apos;t have sex .
close enough .
well , now i wish that we had &apos;t stopped . so , uh ...
so , what happens now ?
in order for this to work ,
you have to follow the rules for the full 30 days .
you don &apos;t mean ...
when are you planning on doing the anastomosis ?
ends will be close enough to join in a day or two .
latest gapogram shows we &apos;re almost there .
how much are you pulling each day ?
uh , about two millimeters .
oh . one &apos;s safer .
why are you up here again ?
do you even know what i &apos;m doing ?
i am taking a wire the width of a hair
and maneuvering it through the mom &apos;s abdomen ,
into the uterus ,
and then through the amniotic cavity ,
and then into the tiny fetus &apos; chest ,
into an insanely tiny heart , to save a tiny human .
hm . yay , you .
ok-- y-- hey , pull gently .
i am . stop it .
think about all the surgeries i &apos;ll save you from having to do .
remind me to thank you later .
now , would you please --
my job &apos;s gonna make your job obsolete .
damn it .
oh , alex , no !
you &apos;re saying we have to start this whole ordeal over again ?
since we had to reattach lee &apos;s sutures in the o.r. ,
it did set us back a few days .
but i assure you , it &apos;s a minor complication of the technique .
nothing about this is minor !
now it sounds like you &apos;ve just made him worse !
honey , maybe this
she hasn &apos;t held her son once .
do you know what that &apos;s like for her ,
for her to stand here
and just see him covered in tubes ?
sir , i &apos;m very sorry .
you &apos;re the one who should be the one apologizing .
you were supposed to do the surgery ,
but you just passed it off to him !
i assure you that dr. karev --
yeah , he &apos;s very good . he &apos;s &quot; awesome . &quot; we remember .
my baby boy &apos;s chest has now been cut into twice ,
so you &apos;ll forgive me if i don &apos;t share your opinion .
alex , hey , i &apos;m s--
no , i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m sorry for not telling you this sooner .
i never should have let you
dictate a procedure i don &apos;t believe in .
this is my patient ,
this is my service ,
this is my nicu .
and last time i checked ,
i was the attending , and you were a fellow ,
so stop overstepping , and get the hell off my floor now !
this lesion is extending
all the way across david &apos;s subtroch region .
i can &apos;t believe he made it this far
without fracturing his entire femur .
how &apos;s the break going ?
meredith .
i mean , diet .
how &apos;s the diet going ?
diet , right .
uh , i &apos;m back on track , i think .
day 16 .
no more late @-@ night binges ?
well , i almost had a , uh , cheeseburger ,
but then i didn &apos;t , so --
that was rough , &apos; cause i like cheeseburgers .
oh , god , i miss cheeseburgers .
derek wants a cheeseburger every single night ,
and i tell him he can &apos;t have one till the end of the year ,
so he should just go and sleep on the couch .
you &apos;re lucky .
at least your diet has an end date -- 30 days , right ?
imagine how good that cheeseburger &apos;s gonna taste
when your diet &apos;s done .
no .
did i go too far ?
no , no , no . look , look .
see that inflammation ?
the blood supply &apos;s completely gone .
a total hip won &apos;t survive in here .
poor healing , crappy surgical bed ,
his immunocompromised state --
it &apos;d be infected within a week .
so , what do you want to do ?
we removed the tumor along with the necrotic bone ,
and we completely washed out the area .
it was fairly inflamed ,
so we also placed antibiotic @-@ loaded cement spacers .
so , right now , he has no hip ?
h @-@ how can he get out of bed or walk ?
he can &apos;t .
that ex @-@ fix i attached is the only thing
securing his leg in place to the rest of his body .
oh , god . why did you ...
you said that you do this all the time .
i am so sorry .
i didn &apos;t know how much damage there would be
until we actually opened your husband up .
the ex @-@ fix is only temporary .
we will find a permanent solution .
the important thing is we got the tumor ,
and we stopped it from causing david any more problems .
i need -- i need to be with him .
of course .
oh , god , i &apos;m having the worst month .
i know what we need .
oh , you are so smart -- so smart .
can &apos;t eat all of this .
oh , no , no .
we &apos;ll split it .
cheers .
wait .
what ?
we could split it .
we are .
no , no , no . what if we -- what if we split it ?
if you want the whole thing , you can have the whole thing .
no , the leg , the -- for david , the -- look , it &apos;s genius .
if we take his fibula bone and we split it into two pieces ,
we can use that to bridge the gap from the tumor resection .
the fibula will still have its native vessel
that we can attach .
so , you attach the pedicle to the circumflex artery
and then core out the necrotic bone ?
you do that ?
works for non @-@ unions .
i don &apos;t see why it wouldn &apos;t work for a tumor .
and he still gets to keep his leg ?
yes !
okay , we &apos;re gonna need more pickles .
we broke the rules again .
so , you had sex ?
no , no .
when she didn &apos;t come home ,
i thought she was sleeping with someone else ,
which is against the rules ,
and , also , the idea really , really bugged me .
and then , when i thought , well , if she &apos;s not doing that ,
then what if she &apos;s not okay ?
&apos;cause that bugged me more .
so , i made her talk to me .
so , i know that we &apos;re not supposed to ,
but we still live in the same house ,
so i know when you don &apos;t come home .
okay .
and i know it &apos;s none of my business , but there &apos;s sofia ,
and so , you know , if something were to happen to you ,
i wouldn &apos;t know where you were or who you were with .
i was here .
don &apos;t .
okay ? &apos; cause i searched the call records for your name .
oh , so you stalked me ?
i was worried .
i was at dinner with grey .
we came up with a fix for a patient ,
and we came back here to work on it .
with meredith ?
yes . what ?
what , you think something ha--
i was with meredith grey , and suddenly , it was 3 : 00 a.m.
i didn &apos;t want to drive home , so i slept in an on @-@ call room .
she was jealous --
like , irrationally , obviously jealous .
do you know how that feels , to have someone be jealous ,
to be worried that you &apos;re cheating ?
it feels nice .
well , it &apos;s not the healthiest --
no , no , no , no , no , i just mean ,
she was -- she was worried about me .
she -- she cared .
does that mean this thing might actually be working ?
all right , just give me a few minutes ,
and i will have viable
and structurally sound bone coming your way .
there &apos;s no sign of infection in the subtroch region ,
so the antibiotic spacers worked .
how &apos;s the blood supply ?
oh , it &apos;s freaking amazing .
all right , we &apos;ll use a portion
of the peroneal artery and its adjoining veins .
okay , ready when you are .
all right , after i finish the femoral canal ,
we will incorporate the fibula
into a plate @-@ and @-@ screw construct to span the defect .
and we &apos;ll do the vessel anastomosis with an 8 @-@ 0 nylon ,
and we &apos;ll do simple , interrupted sutures .
then we will check for leaks
and patch any we find with fat grafts .
hopefully , we &apos;ll have
the patient weight @-@ bearing within a couple of weeks .
any questions ?
dr.torres.
yes ?
when you &apos;re done in here ,
they &apos;re asking that you go down to the e.r.
why ?
push 50 of fentanyl .
what happened ?
paramedics said she ran her car
straight through a guard rail and into a tree .
she &apos;s lucky to be alive .
make it stop .
let me die . please , make it stop .
did she do it on purpose ?
we can &apos;t get anything out of her right now that makes sense .
oh , god .
wait , callie .
what &apos;s the story with this girl ?
i repaired her arm fracture a month ago ,
but she &apos;s still in horrible pain ,
and i @-@ i can &apos;t find anything wrong with her .
there &apos;s nothing wrong with her .
i don &apos;t know if it &apos;s referred pain
or some kind of weird phantom limb , but ...
okay , listen .
... i think she just tried to kill herself .
and don &apos;t tell me it &apos;s not my fault , because it is .
it &apos;s my fault .
it &apos;s my fault that i can &apos;t stop the pain .
stop .
there , see ? you see that ?
those teeny things ? barely .
they &apos;re fluid @-@ filled cysts .
emily &apos;s arm injury ripped the nerves from her spinal cord ,
causing her to develop spinal epilepsy .
instead of having seizures , she develops these --
shocks of pain .
is there any way to -- - fix it ? yeah . it &apos;s risky .
i have to burn the nerve endings of her spine
to stop the communication of the pain signals to her arm .
oh . can you do it ?
are you kidding me ?
so ... addison montgomery with a toddler .
oh , yeah .
henry has completely destroyed her white walls and carpets .
he &apos;s currently into drawing
and spilling and smearing .
yeah , well , looks like we won &apos;t see her
on the conference circuit for a little while .
um , i didn &apos;t know that you knew addison , too .
did you finish rounding ?
yes .
y @-@ yeah . i w @-@ wanted to tell you
that ms.cain gave consent to her valvuloplasty .
um , should i schedule it ?
yeah . day after next .
and you &apos;re leading this one , robbins .
graham will assist and hold the needles .
i &apos;ll observe .
you be ready this time .
yes , ma &apos;am .
did you need something else ?
n @-@ no .
so , henry -- that &apos;s a cute name , though . - it &apos;s cute .
hey , um , how &apos;s he doing ?
can i see the most recent gapogram ?
uh , i &apos;m not sure that i should .
i &apos;m leaving , okay ?
it &apos;s your -- your patient , your nicu ,
your territory , so i &apos;m gone .
okay , cord &apos;s exposed .
i &apos;m about to send down the radio @-@ frequency probe .
i never even thought to look past the arm , and now
i may have blown her chances at culinary school --
gotten her hooked on pain meds , to boot .
it &apos;s not your fault .
no , this -- this problem goes much deeper
than anything you could have seen or could have controlled .
it &apos;s not your fault at all .
calliope . i --
i need to practice .
no talking .
tomorrow &apos;s the last day .
so ? close enough , right ?
oh , what if she makes us start over again ?
so , what if we don &apos;t tell her ?
hey , um , i just got your page .
i thought the cain valvuloplasty
was scheduled for tomorrow .
it was .
ultrasound showed mild fetal hydrops .
so not only does it have to happen today ...
it has to happen right now .
you ready ?
ready .
needle , please ?
stop .
what &apos;s wrong ?
i should be asking you that .
i &apos;m sorry . i don &apos;t follow .
you hesitated .
you steadied your hand . i watched you .
no , no , i &apos;m fine .
are you nervous ?
no .
i mean -- of course i am , but --
why ? why are you nervous ? are you well @-@ rested ?
yes , dr. herman .
but you &apos;re prepared , right ?
you studied the fetal echo ,
you memorized the measurements ,
you practiced the angles ?
do you know exactly how far to insert the needle ,
at which point to deploy the wire , inflate the balloon ?
i do . i think i --
do you think , or you know ?
i know . i know . i know !
graham , trade places with robbins .
absolutely .
dr. herman , i -- - it &apos;s fine .
we &apos;ve just lost some valuable time .
where you been ?
vacation .
right in here is fine .
let me just explain .
do you know how many fetal surgeons there are
west of the mississippi river ?
five . there are five of us .
and i need a sixth , robbins , so i picked you .
out of everyone , i handpicked you .
and you are letting me down .
i &apos;m not just questioning your abilities .
now i &apos;m questioning mine .
i thought you had something .
i thought you were special .
you &apos;re the chief of pediatric surgery .
you &apos;re a member of the board ,
well @-@ respected among peers .
i thought you would be better and in less time .
but today ? today , you embarrassed me .
today , you were unprepared for the second time .
so i might have to rethink this ,
because you might not have what it takes here .
i don &apos;t know what &apos;s wrong with you .
i don &apos;t know what kind of demons you have .
but i can tell you that you are behind in this fellowship ,
and i don &apos;t have time for you to catch up .
i don &apos;t have time for three strikes .
something like this happens again , you &apos;re out .
any pain ?
no .
it &apos;s all gone .
what about your arm ?
nothing .
when my car hit that tree ,
the first thought that came into my head was ,
&quot; at least it &apos;s over &quot; -- no more pain ,
no more swallowing a bunch of pills ,
trying to make it stop ,
no more crying on my couch
watching those stupid , cheesy cooking shows ,
thinking about food i &apos;d never make .
and , god , stop feeling sorry for myself .
thank you .
i finally feel like i might actually survive this .
that &apos;s all you , you know .
well , he &apos;s got a tough road ahead -- months of p.t. --
but that graft should last him for years .
hopefully , this is the beginning of the end for him .
so , what about you ?
it &apos;s day 30 , isn &apos;t it ?
it is .
day 30 .
uh , i am ... weirdly nervous .
i mean , i feel good , but i -- i don &apos;t know .
it feels like coming back from somewhere .
well , even though the diet &apos;s over ,
i &apos;m always up for cheeseburgers and tequila .
actual cheeseburgers .
once the chaos subsides ,
we have to go back ...
... take another look .
we have to ask ourselves ...
... can this body be put back together ?
we were able to put lee &apos;s esophagus back together ,
and i assure you , it &apos;s stronger than ever .
thank you so much .
if we &apos;ve done our jobs right , it can .
we stop the bleeding .
we sew up the damage .
we make the body whole again .
i understand why we did this .
you know , it was to make us stronger , to make us better .
and it did .
i mean , i feel like it really did .
it took a long time ,
and it was painful , and it sucked ,
but ... we &apos;ve come a long way .
and i know that we have further to go , but ...
i love you , calliope .
i love you .
life without you terrifies me .
and the world is just making less and less sense ,
and , like , i don &apos;t know what i &apos;m doing at work anymore ,
but the thing that i need is my anchor .
it &apos;s you .
i need you .
and you &apos;re the only thing that i will ever need .
and i &apos;m so glad that this break is over .
the last 30 days
have taught me so much .
and all i wanted when we first came here
was to know that we would leave together .
but from the minute i sat down , i could feel it .
i felt like i was gonna be suffocated .
the last several weeks ,
i have laughed more , i have done more ,
i have enjoyed myself more , than ...
... and i finally feel free .
and by being free ,
i can see now that constantly trying to fix us
is the thing that &apos;s been killing me slowly .
and i don &apos;t want to do it anymore .
i don &apos;t want to fix it or fix us anymore .
maybe instead of loving you so hard , i should ...
i should be myself for a while .
i should love me ,
and you should love you ,
and together we love sofia , rather than ...
i want so much for you , arizona .
for both of us .
so much more than this .
more than being stuck with someone who feels stuck .
i want you to feel free , too .
but no matter how hard we try ...
... we have to realize ...
... some things ...
just can &apos;t be fixed .
