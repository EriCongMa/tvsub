susan &apos;s new boyfriend met the family .
who are you ?
hi .
i &apos;m mike , the ex @-@ husband. ah .
gaby &apos;s life was no longer glamorous .
it &apos;s official . i &apos;ve lost everything--
first , our money , then my figure ,
now the last threads of our social standing .
gaby , we have a home ,
and we have two beautiful little girls .
danielle &apos;s decision was devastating ...
please , just don &apos;t take him ! benjamin is all i have .
you &apos;re just gonna have to find something else .
and edie &apos;s new husband showed a dark side .
i would consider it a personal favor
if you &apos;d apologize to edie .
no .
now it seems to me that a woman like you
would like to keep the few friends that she has left .
i think you &apos;d better go .
why would you bring me flowers ?
&apos;cause you got a computer ,
and i need to find out some stuff about edie &apos;s husband .
benjamin katz was 6 years old ,
and there were a lot of things he didn &apos;t understand .
he wasn &apos;t sure why the woman you call &quot; mommy &quot;
isn &apos;t always your mother .
or how the man who was always there for him
could suddenly be taken away .
or why you could go for a ride ...
and never come back home .
yes , there were a lot of things
benjamin katz couldn &apos;t understand ,
and no one seemed in a hurry
to explain them .
here they come , finally .
you know , bree , things will be a little strange at first ,
so please , be on your best behavior .
i do not require lectures on tact .
i know. it &apos;s just that we &apos;ve missed benjy so much ,
and it &apos;s taken so many olive branches
to get them to come back .
i &apos;m aware of what &apos;s at stake , orson .
good. so if you feel an impulse to criticize something ,
you &apos;ll keep the thought to yourself .
hi !
i &apos;ve already started .
danielle ! what a delightfully ethnic ensemble .
hey , mom , orson .
hi , danielle .
oh , i want you to meet my husband leo .
it &apos;s nice to finally meet both of you in person .
lovely to meet you , leo .
hey , who &apos;s this little linebacker ?
hi , benjy. remember me ?
i &apos;m not sure .
that &apos;s okay. that &apos;s what this visit is for , right ?
getting to know each other .
now we have you for the whole weekend , right ?
yep , whole three days .
oh , good . &apos; cause we &apos;ve made lots of plans .
we &apos;re gonna take you to the circus
if it &apos;s okay with your folks .
can i go , danielle ?
&quot; danielle &quot; ? did he just call you &quot; danielle &quot; ?
well , it is my name .
yes , i &apos;m aware of that . i picked it .
i &apos;m just concerned
people might view it as a sign of , um , disrespect .
by &quot; people , &quot; you mean you ?
uh ... leo. look at all the luggage you have here .
i &apos;ll give you a hand here .
okay. oh , thanks .
um ... let me be clear .
i do not want him calling me &quot; bree . &quot;
oh , don &apos;t worry . i told him to call you &quot; granny . &quot;
yes , benjamin katz was only 6 years old ,
but even he could understand
this was going to be ...
a long weekend .
any child will tell you
that where you find a playground ,
you will also find ...
bullies--
young tyrants who bring pain ...
intimidation ...
and violence .
what can children do in the face of such torment ?
well , there is one obvious option ,
but not every child is eager to go running home to mother .
ugh. hey. hon .
how was the park ? wait. hold on .
mommy just found her first gray hair .
i need you to grab it , yank it and never speak of it again .
oh. look at your face .
it &apos;s scratched .
what happened ?
nothing .
and your shirt is ripped .
that &apos;s the second time this week .
is someone picking on you ?
who is it ?
is it jeffrey hixon , that weird kid who eats paper ?
is it timmy crowley ?
his mom slept in her car last night .
who knows what &apos;s going on there ?
is it that boy from your birthday ,
the one who slugged the pony ?
oh , sweetie . i know you &apos;re upset ,
but you &apos;ll feel better if you talk about it .
and there &apos;s nothing you can &apos;t tell me . i &apos;m your mommy .
i wanna talk to daddy .
okay .
we &apos;ll give him a call .
you &apos;re not gonna find another one in this condition .
i mean , the car is a classic .
well , what do you think , nabila ?
eh . i like it . i don &apos;t love it .
tell you what .
gaby and i want to find our car a nice home .
so i &apos;m prepared to knock a grand off .
what do you say ?
i say knock off 5 grand , and we &apos;ll talk .
oh , come on. it &apos;s already priced way below blue book ,
not to mention it &apos;s mint .
this is not mint .
hey , can you not see this ding in the bumper here ?
okay , this car goes zero to 60 in 5 seconds .
by the time someone says , &quot; wow , a ding , &quot;
you &apos;re in the next county .
4 grand , you got yourself a deal .
deal .
what ? no ! no , no deal !
the nondriving blind guy does not speak for me .
would you excuse us ?
gaby , we &apos;ve been trying to move this car for a month .
we need the cash .
god , isn &apos;t there any way we can keep it ?
i mean , this car &apos;s the last thing i have
that tells the world , &quot; i &apos;m better than you . &quot;
sorry , babe. we have to pay the mortgage .
we can &apos;t afford to be better than anyone .
here .
take good care of her .
actually , it &apos;s not for us. it &apos;s for our nanny .
okay , that one hurt .
so what &apos;d you dig up on mr. x . ?
you mean dave ?
nothing yet .
it &apos;s been two days. what gives ?
well , for starters , when i search for &quot; dave williams , &quot;
i get a million and a half hits .
to narrow it down , i &apos;m gonna need more information ,
like where he was born , where he went to school .
did he serve time in the military ?
oh , believe me ,
if he served time , it was in the state pen .
hey ! dave !
morning , ladies .
sick bastard .
how are you ?
hey , katherine ,
your sprinkler system working okay now ?
like a charm. and thanks again .
i &apos;ve never been able to get that to work .
oh , i hear ya .
to program those things , you need an engineering degree .
oh , yeah ? you got one of those ?
anyway ... really appreciate it .
take care .
i just can &apos;t go through with this .
he--he just strikes me as so nice .
that &apos;s supposed to comfort me ,
given your track record with men ?
katherine , please .
the guy is bad news .
i can &apos;t prove it , but i feel it in my bones .
and i can &apos;t sit around doing nothing when i know
that edie &apos;s waking up every morning next to him .
if anyone finds out we &apos;re doing this ...
no one will know .
and when they do , they &apos;ll probably thank us .
because i &apos;m telling ya , this guy is up to something .
cleaning out the old garage-- my deepest sympathy .
hey , dave. you--you settling in okay ?
well , they finally delivered my flat screen .
i was dying without it . i mean , it is 65 inches .
wow. sweet !
hey , w--the play @-@ offs are on. you should come check it out .
it &apos;s like being right on the field .
um , lynette &apos;s really busting my hump
about clearing this place out , so ...
well , maybe later .
the game doesn &apos;t start for a couple hours .
we could order one of those giant sandwiches .
sorry , but , you know , check back with me ,
make sure i survive this whole thing .
okay .
hi , dave .
hi .
hey , tom ?
yeah ?
why are there two piles ?
well , that &apos;s the pile that i &apos;m throwing away ,
and , uh , this is the stuff i still need .
you need unopened mountain climbing equipment from 1986 ?
you don &apos;t climb mountains .
not yet , but someday . i mean , you know ... who knows ?
i know. you get winded just climbing out of the tub .
you &apos;re never gonna climb a mountain .
you know what else you &apos;re never gonna do ?
learn german , make your own beer or ...
have 8 minute abs .
come on , not the ab @-@ tastic .
toss it , and keep tossing
until this 2 @-@ car garage can hold at least one car .
please tell me you &apos;re not getting rid of your bass .
no point in hanging on to it .
i mean , being in a band is just one more thing i &apos;ll never do .
before he moved , mike and i ,
we used to get together on saturdays and just ... jam .
man , that was fun .
you know , i play the drums .
maybe you and i should jam sometime .
i guess we could .
maybe even later today ? just ...
yeah ! yeah , you know what ? just give me a couple hours .
i gotta stash these old &quot; playboys . &quot;
i &apos;ll see you later .
now remember , you can &apos;t just start grilling edie ,
or she &apos;ll get suspicious. we have to be subtle .
i &apos;ll just follow your lead .
okay .
sorry i &apos;m late .
what a great idea !
i haven &apos;t done this in ages-- a fun lunch with the girls .
yeah , it &apos;s fun .
where was dave born ?
what ?
we were just wondering
where he got his great ... manners .
he &apos;s got that gentle bearing
of a ... southern gentleman .
no , he &apos;s from somewhere in the midwest .
&quot; somewhere &quot; ?
you don &apos;t know where your husband grew up ?
well , he showed me a picture of his childhood home once .
it had a cow in it . i lost interest .
honestly , edie , how can you be married to a guy
and not know these things ?
you know what ?
i think it &apos;s time to order. where &apos;s our waitress ?
i &apos;ll be right with you , mrs. mayfair .
oh , no problem , debbie. you take your time .
she is such a sweet girl .
she &apos;s saving money for college .
speaking of which ... where did dave go to college ?
come on , debbie ! while we &apos;re young !
i don &apos;t know .
all right. what about high school ?
why are you asking me all these questions ?
i just think it &apos;s odd that you &apos;re married to some guy--
you don &apos;t know anything about him .
other than the fact that he &apos;s a lovely man .
he ... fixed my sprinkler .
i don &apos;t want to talk about this anymore .
i &apos;m going to the ladies &apos; room .
well , your subtle approach got us nowhere .
i &apos;ve been through a lot with this baby .
i hate to sell her , but , you know ,
with my new sports car coming , i don &apos;t really need it .
yeah. here she is .
how &apos;s it look ?
be glad you &apos;re blind .
we have to be practical .
we just need something to get us from point &quot; a &quot; to point &quot; b . &quot;
now let &apos;s buy the thing .
okay , just let me handle this .
so ... do we have a sale ?
i don &apos;t know , andrew .
i mean ... we like it. we don &apos;t love it .
yeah , well , no one buys a car like this and loves it .
it &apos;s all about the price. and you &apos;re not gonna do better .
yeah , about that price--
you &apos;re gonna have to drop it . i mean , look at all these dents .
yeah , it &apos;s also missing three hubcaps ,
and it &apos;s got a hanger for an antenna .
full disclosure-- it &apos;s a piece of crap .
you want it or not ?
well , i &apos;ll tell you what .
since your mom and i are dear friends ,
i &apos;ll take it off your hands if you knock off $ 300 .
and since my mom and you are dear friends ,
i &apos;ll resist the urge to flip you the bird .
andrew !
unless you lower this price , we &apos;re walking ... right now .
see ya .
i mean it .
this is it .
fine .
fine .
okay , fine. knock off $ 200 , and we &apos;ll give you cash .
no . $ 100 .
no. wh--
will you at least have it washed ?
i &apos;ll empty the ashtray. final offer .
damn you .
oh ! you beat me again !
curse you and your diabolical checkers prowess .
all right , orson .
don &apos;t overexcite him on the upholstery .
so , danielle , what would you like me to make as a side dish
for your welcome home party ?
i can do anything
so long as it complements beef tenderloin .
actually , we don &apos;t eat meat. we &apos;re vegetarians .
excuse me ? so is benjamin .
oh. well ... since when ?
since i realized that meat was a byproduct of murder .
would it be more acceptable
if i shopped for a suicidal pork loin ?
bree , it &apos;s no big deal .
i &apos;ll just make a nice risotto .
this isn &apos;t about dinner .
this is about her nutty liberal politics
getting in the way of our grandson &apos;s nutrition .
he gets all the protein he needs
from cheese and beans and tofu .
well , this isn &apos;t just about nutrition .
do you want him to be teased at school
every time he pulls tofu out of his lunchbox ?
actually , that won &apos;t be an issue .
danielle is homeschooling him .
excuse me ?
you &apos;re teaching him ?
yes . i take it you have an opinion ?
so instead of sending him to a proper school ,
you &apos;re gonna give him the benefit
of your straight &quot; c &quot; average ? hey , he &apos;s only 6,
and he &apos;s already reading at a third grade level .
well , what happens next year when he overtakes you ?
uh , bree ... ahem. best behavior , remember ?
i am sorry , but am i supposed to sit by
while she degrades his body and his mind ?
fine .
criticize my parenting all you want .
i don &apos;t care ,
because you don &apos;t get to decide how he &apos;s raised anymore .
i &apos;m his mother .
and by the way , mark your calendars ,
&apos;cause seven years from next saturday--
benjamin &apos;s bar mitzvah .
isn &apos;t this cool ?
dave brought his drums over so we could jam .
your boy is pretty good .
yeah , and we figured out we got bass , we got drums .
mike plays guitar . i think orson plays keyboards .
you see where i am going with this ?
i do , but i &apos;m hoping i &apos;m wrong .
we &apos;re gonna start a garage band !
and i wasn &apos;t ! maybe if we get good enough ,
we can even get , like , a couple of gigs .
how fun would that be ? &quot; gigs &quot; ? did you just say &quot; gigs &quot; ?
now all &apos;s we need is a little time to practice--
a few nights a week , some weekends .
what ? well , yeah ,
just until we get the rhythm section all dialed in .
okay , i need to dial you in to some gigs you already have ,
which are running a restaurant ,
being a husband and a father .
and i thought you were the one who said
you wanted to spend more time with your family .
but we could play clubs .
i mean , he &apos;s just having a little fun , lynette .
guys need to blow off steam .
could you just ... for a sec ?
come on. you know i &apos;m right. you &apos;re far too busy for this .
you can &apos;t just decide for me like that .
i mean , if i wanna play bass ,
i will play bass .
i &apos;m not hurting anybody .
those of us with hearing beg to differ .
okay , you know what ?
please leave our rehearsal space .
oh , come on , tom. this is not your--
it &apos;s mine ! no !
give it ! give it ! no ! no !
give it to me ! it &apos;s mine ! don &apos;t !
guys ! hey ! knock it off back there .
oh , god. what now ?
. oh. hey. what &apos;s up ?
you sold me a lemon .
that &apos;s what &apos;s up .
what yre you talking about ?
your car !
i took it to a mechac , who told me the radiator &apos;s shot .
oh. that. yeahhu
it &apos;s been giving me trouble for years. just use the jug .
what jug
oh , oh , it &apos;s in trunk.you just keep it full of waters
if the radiation over heat. fill it up
oh , and , uh , try not going up hills
and stay in the shade as much as possible .
okay , i @-@ i can &apos;t drive around avoiding gravity and the sun .
well , sorry .
if you want a car with no flaws , buy a new one .
or i could get the radiator fixed ,
which is gonna cost $ 300 , which you are paying for .
whoa , whoa , whoa .
remember full disclosure ? crap ?
this is your car. it &apos;s your problem .
okay , you know what ? that &apos;s it . i wanna talk to your mother .
uh , well , she &apos;s in a meeting right now .
can i take a message ? damn it , andrew .
you tell bree to call me by the end of the day .
may i ask what it &apos;s regarding ?
all right , we &apos;ll talk about it more later , buddy .
why don &apos;t you go on outside and play for a while ? okay .
well , what did he say ?
well , he still won &apos;t tell me who &apos;s picking on him ,
but he did ask me to teach him how to fight. he &apos;s only 5 .
i don &apos;t want him fighting .
i &apos;m sorry , but every boy
has to learn how to throw a punch eventually. ugh .
you know , if you wanna give him a leg up ,
you could teach him a little capoeira. capo @-@ what ?
oh , it &apos;s a brazilian martial art
that incorporates dance .
yeah , &apos; cause there &apos;s nothing scarier
than a guy coming at ya with jazz hands .
hat &apos;s funny , but actually ,
the dance part &apos;s to catch your opponent off guard .
like that ? no , there &apos;s a little more nuance to it .
ooh ! like that .
where &apos;s the &quot; dance &quot; part ?
oh ! there it is , ginger !
you know what , boys ? not in the house .
oh , my god !
give it back ! it &apos;s my ball ! it &apos;s my ball now .
hey ! you leave him alone .
oh ! honey !
is that who &apos;s been picking on you ? juanita solis ?
uh @-@ huh .
well , she is going to get a big surprise ,
because your daddy
is about to turn you into a killing machine .
uh , m.j. , can i talk to your mom for a second ?
mm @-@ hmm .
what ?
i can &apos;t teach him to hit a girl .
that &apos;s not just any girl. you saw her .
she could take down a small deer .
it doesn &apos;t matter .
if it wears a skirt , it &apos;s off @-@ limits .
that is sexist .
if feminism means anything , it &apos;s that it &apos;s okay
for a big , mean girl to get her butt kicked .
you , teach him
one of those brazilian kung fu cha @-@ cha things .
i &apos;m with mike .
you can &apos;t hit girls .
ah ! couple of wusses .
i &apos;ll handle it myself .
oops ! didn &apos;t see that coming .
just for that , i &apos;m breaking my rule about not hitting girls .
gaby , we have a problem .
i just saw juanita push m.j. down .
really ?
really .
it &apos;s not the first time. juanita &apos;s been bullying him .
wow . i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;ll talk to her .
thank you .
and don &apos;t worry. no one will hear about this from me .
hear what ?
that m.j. &apos; s getting beat up by a little girl .
well ...
a girl .
are you suggesting
that juanita is fat for her age ?
gaby , juanita &apos;s fat for your age .
yeah ? well , let &apos;s face it .
m.j. could get beaten up by a kitten .
you know what ?
maybe you could teach your daughter
how to use her words and not her fists .
yeah ? or maybe you could teach your son to grow a hair !
what you looking at ?
oh , just some old pictures .
can you guess who that little girl is ?
that &apos;s your mom way back when she was your age .
what &apos;s she eating ?
oh ! uh , a hot dog .
no way .
oh , yes. your mother loved hot dogs .
every day at lunchtime , she &apos;d say to me ,
&quot; mommy , i want a hot dog . &quot;
how come she doesn &apos;t eat them now ?
well , because she &apos;s all grown @-@ up .
you see , hot dogs and hamburgers
are what make little boys and girls
grow up to be big and strong .
and now that she &apos;s grown @-@ up , she doesn &apos;t need them anymore .
doesn &apos;t mommy want me to be big and strong ?
i &apos;ve been asking myself that all day .
maybe she &apos;s afraid if you get big ,
you &apos;ll leave home and go play for the red sox .
but i want to get big . i want to play baseball .
oh. well ...
in that case ...
can i ?
you have to promise not to tell your mommy .
okay .
well , what do you think ?
it &apos;s like tofu , only better .
yes .
yes , it is .
two , three , four !
when tom scavo threw himself into his new hobby ...
his wife told herself
it was a phase , and it would pass quickly .
but three hours later , she realized
it could not pass quickly enough .
so lynette began to plot
against her husband &apos;s instrument of torture .
ooh ! careful , honey .
sorry .
you could break your dad &apos;s guitar and ...
it was at that moment her daughter
provided her an idea for a ... simple accident ...
and ... a clean alibi .
damn it !
hey , is everything all right ? oh , my !
it was lying in the middle of the floor !
how in the world did that happen ?
has penny been playing in here again ?
i &apos;ve told her a million times !
now i &apos;m sure it was an accident , tom. please don &apos;t yell at her .
this was a $ 1,600 bass .
i can &apos;t afford to replace it .
penny lynn scavo !
where is she ?
oh , tom !
she &apos;s up in her room .
i &apos;m gonna go play outside .
oh ! wait. your forgot your whistle .
okay , sweetie .
this is just to be on the safe side .
if juanita comes around , you just blow it .
i &apos;ll be right there. okay .
good boy .
hey , give me back my whistle !
juanita solis , don &apos;t you move ! you are in big trouble !
what &apos;s on your head ?
never mind .
what did you do to m.j. ?
he wouldn &apos;t let me blow his whistle .
so your solution was to push him down ?
do you think that &apos;s nice ?
how would you feel if someone did that to you ? i wouldn &apos;t care .
oh , really ? you don &apos;t think it would hurt ?
even if it did ...
i &apos;m not a crybaby like m.j.
i &apos;m sorry .
juanita , i just wanted you to see how it felt .
are you okay ?
susan , i saw that !
kids , get inside !
okay , first of all , it wasn &apos;t as bad as it looked .
really ? &apos; cause it looked like you body @-@ slammed my daughter .
i barely tapped her. she was milking it .
that &apos;s your defense ? you were only assaulting her &quot; a little &quot; ?
i was trying to teach her not to be a bully--
something she should have learned from her mother .
well , i &apos;m sorry . i was too busy trying to explain to her
why m.j. doesn &apos;t wear a dress like all the other little girls .
this conversation is over .
tell bob and lee that i &apos;ll pay for the dent in their lawn .
you did not !
i did .
you know what ?
we &apos;ve both been incredibly childish here ,
and it is time one of us took the high road ,
so i am now going to walk away .
please take note of this conflict resolution
and try to pass the lesson on to your daughter .
you can dye that hair all you want ,
but the gray &apos;s just gonna keep coming .
and they call me white trash .
you got a minute ? yeah. sure. come on in .
i , uh , i heard there was a little accident .
so ...
i got this for tom .
you bought tom a new bass ?
it &apos;s not as smooth as his old one , but it &apos;s good .
we can &apos;t accept this .
it &apos;s mostly selfish on my part . i was having too much fun .
well , sorry .
but maybe you could go skateboarding with orson .
all right .
forget about me .
tom was having fun .
and from what i &apos;ve seen , he needs it .
and what makes you think you know what my husband needs ?
just something that i saw the other day ,
when you were making him get rid of all his things .
you mean his junk ?
it may be junk to you ,
but to tom ...
well , that was stuff he was gonna get around to .
you know what a midlife crisis is ?
i &apos;m married to a 45 @-@ year @-@ old man who has a red convertible .
yeah , i think i know .
but you know how it happens ? a man gets to a certain age ,
and he realizes ... he &apos;s gonna die someday .
really die .
and what &apos;s worse is that he &apos;s everything he &apos;s ever gonna be .
he &apos;s never gonna be rich .
he &apos;s never gonna climb a mountain .
now some guys do bad things
when they get those thoughts in their heads .
by comparison ,
playing in a garage band-- well ...
it seems pretty harmless .
so ... now my marriage is in trouble ,
and you &apos;re gonna save it by giving tom a bass ?
no. no . i &apos;m not .
you are .
most of the guys in my class went into corporate law ,
but i wanted to do something
that would influence environmental policy .
that &apos;s how he ended up at the e.p.a.
so , leo , where did you study law ?
cornell .
now i &apos;m jealous .
i always wished that i &apos;d gone to a school like cornell .
but ... it just wasn &apos;t in the cards for me .
how about you , dave ?
me ? no. wasn &apos;t in my cards , either .
so where did you go ?
after listening to leo , i &apos;d be embarrassed to tell you .
so ... e.p.a.
what &apos;s your opinion on global warming--
fact or fiction ?
hold on , darling .
mrs. mccluskey asked you a question .
tell her where you went to school .
oh , edie , i think she was just making conversation. so--
okay , then why don &apos;t you tell me where you went ?
after all , i am your wife. shouldn &apos;t i know ?
actually , i didn &apos;t go to college .
i took a job out of high school
because my family was having a hard time .
not having a degree is something that has always
been embarrassing to me ,
especially when i &apos;m with people who do .
so , my darling , is there anything else
you &apos;d like to quiz me about in public ?
my ... childhood stuttering ?
my dad &apos;s drinking problems ?
no . i &apos;m ... good .
i came to say i &apos;m sorry .
you attacked my child and then me .
why should i even listen to you ?
i brought booze .
come on in .
like , i have this rule--
no toy guns .
except everything that m.j. picks up--
whether it &apos;s a hairbrush , a hanger , everything--
he pretends it &apos;s a gun. well , what do you expect ? he &apos;s a boy .
that &apos;s my point !
i know nothing about raising boys .
and i think m.j. has figured this out ,
so he goes straight to mike whenever there &apos;s a problem .
but that &apos;s okay. mike &apos;s a great dad .
yeah , sure , on alternate weekends .
that &apos;s fine ...
until ... m.j. needs his daddy ,
and his daddy &apos;s not there .
susan , it &apos;s not your fault .
well , we split up ,
so it &apos;s at least half my fault any way you slice it .
well , if it &apos;s any consolation ,
carlos is a hands @-@ on , full @-@ time dad ,
and i still feel like i &apos;m not getting the job done ,
like ... i &apos;m not preparing them enough .
preparing them for what ?
for how hard life is .
i mean , i have to admit ,
when you told me juanita was bullying m.j. ,
my first thought was , thank god !
let her do the pushing ,
just as long as she &apos;s not a victim .
well , i don &apos;t see any kid of yours being a victim .
you &apos;re the strongest person i know .
i used to be .
look at my life , susan .
i ...
i &apos;ve been beaten down .
well , i thought i had you beaten today ,
and the next thing i knew , i was eating grass .
today doesn &apos;t count. today i was mad .
well ...
maybe you need to get mad more often .
maybe you &apos;re right .
this is nice .
we should rumble all the time .
to susan mayer--
good mom .
to gabrielle solis--
another good mom .
mommy , we &apos;re hungry !
so ? ! there &apos;s waffles in the freezer !
and get mommy some ice !
isn &apos;t this nice ?
for the first time in years ,
my family is all here under the same roof .
here &apos;s to many more meals together .
welcome home .
cheers .
i don &apos;t feel good , danielle .
&quot; danielle &quot; ?
i think i &apos;m gonna be sick .
let &apos;s get you to the powder room .
here we are--
mushroom risotto .
there &apos;s an unfortunate coincidence .
i &apos;m so sorry , mom . i &apos;ll clean it up .
no , um , you take benjy upstairs . i &apos;ll get it .
orson , could you get the mop , please ?
oh , my god. is that meat ?
no !
of course not .
does this look like meat to you ?
it &apos;s ... hard to tell .
just so we &apos;re clear ,
what i &apos;m about to throw up is a western omelet .
that is not meat .
that piece right there-- that &apos;s definitely meat !
still waiting on that mop .
what did grandma give you to eat ?
she said not to tell .
you gave him meat and then told him to lie ? !
i gave him a hot dog , all right ?
he liked it so much , he asked for another .
two hot dogs ?
all right ,
i &apos;ll concede the second one was clearly a mistake .
come on , leo. we &apos;re leaving .
no ! danielle , please .
i &apos;m sorry , orson .
she &apos;s made it impossible for us to stay in this house .
danielle , wait , wait .
well , we can still drink , right ?
oh , yeah .
well , i &apos;ve apologized till i &apos;m blue in the face ,
but they &apos;re still leaving in the morning .
now you &apos;re not speaking to me , either ?
they &apos;re just mad .
things will be better next time .
you honestly think there &apos;ll be a next time ?
it took us three years to talk them into this visit .
it took you one day to ruin it .
orson , i &apos;m truly sorry .
it &apos;s just , seeing ...
all these mistakes that she &apos;s making with benjamin ,
it &apos;s just so hard for me .
you know what hard for me ?
when i left for prison ,
benjamin was in my house , he was in my life .
he called me &quot; daddy . &quot;
and when i came home , he was gone .
and you think that &apos;s my fault ?
yes , i do .
orson , you weren &apos;t here .
she came back. she was married to a lawyer .
and don &apos;t forget , she is his mother !
i tried to fight , but--
you should &apos;ve fought harder .
i was on my knees . i was sobbing .
she said &quot; no &quot; and then ripped him out of my arms .
you have no right to say that to me .
you kind of blindsided me tonight .
i know . i am so sorry .
i was clearly uncomfortable .
i don &apos;t understand why you kept pressing me .
honestly , it was all karen mccluskey &apos;s fault .
really ? how so ?
well , she kept asking me all this stuff about your background
and why i don &apos;t know more about you , and ...
i should &apos;ve just never let her get to me .
it &apos;s okay , sweetie .
now i understand .
kind of sad when you think about it .
what do you mean ? oh ...
maybe you guys don &apos;t notice
because you &apos;re so used to her .
but her behavior reminds me of my grandmother ,
when we first started to notice ...
the dementia , that is .
you think karen &apos;s going senile ?
i remember my poor grandmother ...
started getting so paranoid .
she thought people were breaking into her house and ...
stealing her things .
we finally had to put her in a home .
i just hope that doesn &apos;t happen to karen .
i want my 300 bucks .
i told you. it &apos;s your car. you deal with it .
that &apos;s it ? no compassion ?
no , &quot; hey , let &apos;s split the bill and call it even &quot; ?
look at it this way. you &apos;re not losing 300 bucks .
you &apos;re gaining a valuable lesson--buyer beware .
true. now here &apos;s a valuable lesson for you .
what the hell is wrong with you ? !
give me my money ,
or next time we &apos;re trading paint .
you &apos;re bluffing .
i am tired of being a victim , andrew .
and trust me , that is no bluff .
hey ! you--you touch my car , and you &apos;re paying for it .
luckily , i &apos;m insured. oh , wait. our policy lapsed .
hope you &apos;ve got good coverage .
wait ! wait ! wait ! wait ! wait , wait .
i &apos;ll get my checkbook .
i prefer cash .
bullies ...
any adult will tell you the playground
is not the only place to find them .
everywhere you look , you can find people unconcerned
or unaware of the pain they inflict .
it might be a neighbor
preying on the suspicions of her friend ...
or a daughter
punishing the choices of her mother .
or a housewife seeking justice
from the man who sold her a car .
yes ...
there are bullies everywhere .
and the worst are the ones who take advantage of you
without you ever knowing ...
