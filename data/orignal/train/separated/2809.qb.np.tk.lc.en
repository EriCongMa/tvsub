i know . i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;ll make a deal with you , okay ?
every night that you &apos;re asleep before i get home ...
... i will wake you up in a way that has proved popular in the past .
well , if you need to stay late , i want to be supportive of that .
look at you . since when do you rollerblade ?
since tomorrow .
i met a cute guy in the park .
and he jogs and blades and swims and so we made a deal .

and what are you gonna do for him ?
i &apos;m gonna let him .
cool .
good morning .
somebody got in late last night .
yeah , well , i ran into richard .
when did this happen ?
around 8 : 02 .
we talked for a while , and then we went out for an innocent burger .
there &apos;s no such thing as an &quot; innocent burger . &quot;
gonna see him again ?
tomorrow night .
monica , what are you doing ?
she spent six months getting over him ...
... and now she &apos;s celebrating that by going on a date with him .
it &apos;s not a date , okay ?
i &apos;m teaching him how to make a lasagna for a potluck dinner .
you might want to make extra , because you &apos;ll be hungry after the sex .
we &apos;re not gonna have sex .
nothing &apos;s changed here . he still doesn &apos;t want children , and i still do .
so we &apos;re just gonna be friends .
naked friends .
do you have any ice ?
check the freezer .
if there &apos;s none in there , we &apos;re probably out .
are you just getting home ? it &apos;s late .
i know . i had the greatest day , though .
i went to a meeting with reps from calvin klein .
i liked a line of lingerie , so my boss ordered a ton of it . and you ?
i discovered i &apos;m able to count all my teeth using just my tongue .
why do you have a copy of the shining in your freezer ?
i was reading it last night and i got scared , so ....
but you &apos;re safe from it if it &apos;s in the freezer ?
well , safer .
i never start reading it ...
... without making sure we got room in the freezer .
how often do you read it ?
haven &apos;t you ever read a book over and over again ?
i read little women more than once .
it &apos;s a classic . what &apos;s so great about the shining ?
the question should be , what is not so great about the shining ?
and the answer would be , &quot; nothing . &quot; all right ?
this is the scariest book ever .
i bet it &apos;s better than that classic of yours .
we &apos;ll just see about that , okay ?
i will read the shining , and you will read little women .
all right , you got it .
now , rach , these little women ....
how little are they ?
i mean , are they , like , scary little ?
you know , l love this fabric .
l think l &apos;m gonna have a suit made out of this .
chandler , ross ? this is robert .
you have lipstick right here .
that &apos;s okay , it &apos;s mine . we just kissed .
isn &apos;t it a bit cold out for shorts ?
well , i &apos;m from california .
right . sometimes you guys just burst into flame .
i &apos;m up . i &apos;m up . i &apos;ve gotten up now . anybody want anything ?
i &apos;ll have coffee .
me too .

ross , why don &apos;t you come with me ?
what &apos;s the matter ? what &apos;s going on ?
robert &apos;s coming out .
what do you mean ? is he gay ?
he &apos;s coming out of his shorts .
what ?
the man is showing brain .
are you sure ? hold on .
i &apos;m sorry . that was a coffee and a ....
coffee . we could write it down .
no , no . that won &apos;t be necessary .
well ?
what do we do ? what do we do ?
well , i suppose we just try to not look directly at it .
like an eclipse .
when people compliment my cooking tonight , what do i say ?
you say , &quot; thank you . &quot; then you buy me something pretty .
come on , we &apos;re gonna put our hands in this bowl ...
... and we &apos;re gonna start squishing the tomatoes .
this feels very weird .
you touch people &apos;s eyeballs and this feels weird ?
sure , i touch them . but i spent years learning not to squish them .
that &apos;s my hand .
keep squishing .
the tomatoes are squishing .
you got some on your shirt .
hold on a second .
just put a little club soda on it . get to it right away .
it should do ...
... the trick .
what ?
you &apos;ve got some on your pants .
i &apos;ll just throw them out .
these little women !
you &apos;re liking it ?
oh , yeah . amy just burned jo &apos;s manuscript .
i don &apos;t see how he could forgive her .
jo &apos;s a girl . it &apos;s short for josephine .
but jo &apos;s got a crush on laurie .
you mean it &apos;s like a girl @-@ girl thing ?
that is the one thing missing from the shining .
no , actually , laurie &apos;s a boy .
no wonder rachel had to read this so many times .
how &apos;d the basketball go ?
i learned how to shoot a lay @-@ up , a foul shot , and a 23 @-@ pointer .
you mean a 3 @-@ pointer ?
i get more because i &apos;m dainty .
is there a phone here to check my messages ?
ln back . do you want a quarter ?
i always carry one in my sock .
what are you doing ? get back on your side
hello !
i &apos;m joey . we haven &apos;t met .
good to meet you . robert .
what ?
what ? you guys , what is going on ?
do you not like robert ?
why are you laughing ?
calm down . no reason to get testy .
you guys ! come on !
we &apos;re sorry .
it just seems that robert isn &apos;t as concealed in the shorts area ...
... as one may have hoped .
what do you mean ?
could you pass me those cookies ?
sure .
ball ? -yeah .
so how &apos;d the lasagna go over ?
really ? good . so you owe me three pretty things .
i &apos;ve been thinking about you too .
well , no . it &apos;s hard , this &quot; platonomy &quot; thing .
it &apos;s a word .
i do think it &apos;s better this way . we &apos;re being smart .
yes , i &apos;m sure .
you really sure ?
i &apos;ll call you back .
so we can be friends who sleep together .
absolutely . this &apos;ll just be something we do .
like racquetball .
sounds smart and healthy to me .
so just out of curiosity ...
... do you currently have any other &quot; racquetball &quot; buddies ?
just your dad .
although that &apos;s actually racquetball .
you know , i do have a blind date ...
... with my sister &apos;s neighbor next tuesday .
do you want me to cancel it ?
no !
because if you did , that means you &apos;d be canceling for me .
and we &apos;re just friends .
exactly .
and besides , it wouldn &apos;t be fair anyway ...
... because my mother &apos;s trying to set me up with some lawyer .
so who &apos;s this lawyer ?
no , she doesn &apos;t actually have one , but she &apos;s looking .
oh , don &apos;t sit down .
ready to go ?
you bet .
and first , here &apos;s a gift .
stretchy pants ? !
the greatest things in the world ! if i were you , i &apos;d wear them every day .
gee , thank you . really , that &apos;s so nice .
but , to be honest , i don &apos;t think i can wear these .
they &apos;re so tight . i &apos;d feel like i &apos;m on display .
i &apos;m sorry .
that &apos;s all right . i &apos;ll figure ....
how &apos;s it going ?
good .
how &apos;s the shining ?
danny just went into room 217 .
the next part &apos;s the best ! that dead lady in the bathtub
you &apos;re gonna ruin it !
i &apos;ll talk in code .
remember when the kid sees those two &quot; blanks &quot; in the hallway ?
yeah , that &apos;s very cool .
all &quot; blank &quot; and no &quot; blank &quot; makes &quot; blank &quot; a &quot; blank @-@ blank . &quot;
no , the end !
jack almost kills them with the &quot; blank ... &quot;
... but in the last second , they get away .
i can &apos;t believe you just did that .
i can &apos;t believe she cracked your code .
okay . laurie proposes to jo and she says no ...
... even though she &apos;s in love with him . then he ends up marrying amy .
mine was by accident !
the boiler explodes and destroys the hotel and kills the dad .
beth dies .
beth dies ?
is that true ? if i keep reading , is beth gonna die ?
no , beth doesn &apos;t die . she doesn &apos;t die . does she , rachel ?
he &apos;s asking if you &apos;ve ruined ...
... the first book he &apos;s ever loved that didn &apos;t star jack nicholson .
no . she doesn &apos;t die .
then why would you say that ?
because i wanted to hurt you .
oh , there they are . i dropped my keys .
got them .
sorry . i &apos;m sorry .
you would not believe my day .
i had to work two shifts . and then to top it off ...
... i lost one of my fake boobs in a grill fire .
what are you smiling at ?
i was thinking your day could still pick up .
i love this &quot; friend &quot; thing !
robert &apos;s gonna be here any second , so could one of you just tell him ?
please , right now .
every time i see him , it &apos;s &quot; ls it on the loose ? is it watching me ? &quot;
we can &apos;t tell him .
you can &apos;t go up to a guy you barely know and talk about his &quot; stuff . &quot;
he &apos;s right . even if it &apos;s to say something complimentary .
why don &apos;t you just tell him ? you &apos;re going out with him .
way too awkward . no. l haven &apos;t even seen it with permission yet .
so , what do l do ? just break up with him ?
l don &apos;t know. l think this is an unsolvable problem .
lt &apos;s a curiette mariah .
captain kirk &apos;s unsolvable problem ...
... as part of his training to be a star fleet commander .
kobayashi maru .
what &apos;s a curiette mariah ?
lt &apos;s the place with the cheap rooms where we stayed in lsrael .
you ready for the gym ?
there &apos;s a new rock @-@ climbing wall . we can spot each other .
yeah , i can spot you from here .
what ?
listen , robert ....
hey , don &apos;t we have to ... ?
yeah , we got ....
i think you &apos;re really , really great .
oh , god . here we go again .
why does this keep happening ? is it something i &apos;m putting out there ?
is this my fault ? or am i just nuts ?
i don &apos;t know what to say .
hey , buddy ? this is a family place . put the mouse back in the house .
really ? it &apos;s just like everyone else &apos;s apartment .
it &apos;s got rooms and walls and ceilings .
i just wanted to see where you live . now give me the tour .
oh , my god !
this is the living room .
that &apos;s nice .
and this is the kitchen .
that &apos;s real pretty .
wait a minute . don &apos;t i get to see the bedroom ?
well , it &apos;s pretty much your typical ...
... bedroom .
we &apos;re still on this side of the door . i didn &apos;t get to see it .
oh , shoot . maybe next time . thanks for a lovely evening .
so who is she ?
that was the blind date i told you about .
she called and switched it from tuesday .
did you like her ?
i &apos;m just asking as a friend , because i am totally fine with this .
well , you seem fine .
okay , you know what ? i &apos;m not fine . i &apos;m not .
i mean , how could i be fine ? hearing you come in with her .
she wants to see your bedroom .
you know what ?
what if we &apos;re friends ...
... who don &apos;t see other people ?
you mean &quot; exclusive &quot; friends ?
why not ?
i mean , this has been the most amazing week .
would it be so terrible ?
even if we were friends who lived together ?
or maybe someday , friends who stood up in front of their other friends ...
... and vowed to be friends forever .
you know , we &apos;re back where we were .
honey , i would love to do all that , but nothing &apos;s changed .
that &apos;s not true . you don &apos;t have a moustache .
okay , one thing &apos;s changed .
but we still want different things , and we know how this is gonna end .
you know what ?
i gotta walk out of here right now .
because getting over you is the hardest thing i have ever had to do .
i don &apos;t think i could do it again .
i know i couldn &apos;t .
how about one last game of racquetball ?
watch the thorns !
what ?
beth is really , really sick .
jo &apos;s there , but i don &apos;t think there &apos;s anything she can do .
