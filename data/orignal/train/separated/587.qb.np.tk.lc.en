* best friends , best friends *
* - making a cake
pyoo ! *
i never thought i &apos;d miss it .
how come i &apos;m not best friends with anyone in the group ?
don &apos;t patronize me .
* she &apos;ll be coming around the mountain *
* when she comes , whoo @-@ whoo *
just letting the students know
that if you &apos;re on campus this weekend ,
you &apos;ll have to park on the street
because of the carnival .
on an unrelated note , i &apos;m into trains now .
a real carnival ?
is the company called red beard &apos;s amusements ?
name rings a bell .
but with me , that could mean anything .
i wonder .
i have an ex @-@ boyfriend that travels with a carnival .
i &apos;m sorry , britta .
some things are funny because they make no sense .
and that is not one of them .
well , it looks like my news has incited some doings .
and if that &apos;s not my job , what is ?
choo choo !
well , you &apos;re also supposed to--
administrate the school .
so , britta , tell us about your carnival worker boyfriend .
why , so you all can get a big laugh ?
yeah .
i &apos;d love to have a laugh .
the exact reason .
fine . i &apos;m not ashamed of my past .
and if it entertains you guys ,
that &apos;s great because we &apos;re friends .
his name is blade and--
what ?
oh , no , britta !
she invoked friendship to undercut the laugh ,
and we &apos;re still laughing . that &apos;s how funny it is !
his name is blade . is that legal ?
shouldn &apos;t new line cinema be suing him ?
he was called that before that stupid movie .
he was called that before the fantastic movie .
and it was a marvel comic in 1973 .
well , nerd alert .
well , ex @-@ boyfriend named blade alert .
her love life makes pierce seem with it .
her pain unifies us .
she has the king arthur of bad taste in men .
i &apos;m glad you guys are reacting this way .
i need to be reminded that he is the worst on earth .
because if he comes through town and calls me ,
i will be there in five minutes .
i don &apos;t understand .
uh , andre much ?
okay , i understand .
i don &apos;t .
you will .
what &apos;s that mean ?
he &apos;s hung .
oh , god !
pierce , you &apos;re disgusting .
just like that i &apos;m disgusting again .
i was one of the gang . it was in my hand .
sometimes , a woman meets a man
that she just can &apos;t shake from her system
no matter much she knows better .
i lucked out with andre , but god help me .
as you all know , there &apos;s not a lot he couldn &apos;t get away with .
so what , britta ? you &apos;re in love with a guy
who &apos;s named after a kickboxing vampire movie ?
a fantastic kickboxing vampire movie .
no , i don &apos;t believe in love because of this guy ...
named after a kickboxing vampire movie .
oh , britta !
oh , sweetie .
you wanna watch blade tonight ?
yes .
第三季第十五集
ugh , i love that i have a locker now .
all that wasted time going to my car
for mid @-@ afternoon wardrobe adjustments .
what do you think , hmm ? stick with what &apos;s working ?
you &apos;re gonna change your shirt ?
not if it &apos;s working .
it &apos;s not working .
yeah .
you &apos;re right . i knew it .
i &apos;ll have what she &apos;s having .
hey , grow up , lady !
annie !
his shirt wasn &apos;t working !
i need your help .
it is blade &apos;s carnival that &apos;s coming .
he &apos;s working the bb gun duck @-@ shooting gallery .
i guess he finally got the promotion .
and he will call me .
and left unattended ,
i will end up doing him like a crossword ,
and i will regret it .
so i need you to take my phone ,
and don &apos;t give it back until monday !
of course . okay .
for real ?
pipe it !
and i need to stay with you this weekend .
not just stay with you , i need to be on lockdown .
you were a pillhead , so think of blade as adderall .
and handcuff me to the radiator
like a mother @-@ flipping carny @-@ banging werewolf .
i got this . i got this .
our apartment has central heating ,
but i get the idea-- stay strong .
man , i wonder how many women i &apos;ve affected this way .
all aboard the human being railway !
next stop , spo--
i &apos;ll get to the point .
i &apos;d like your student troy barnes
enrolled in the air conditioning repair program immediately .
oh , a wonderful opportunity for a young man of ...
urban race .
yet try as i might , i &apos;m unable to make him see it that way .
i need you to change his mind .
but if he &apos;s not interested , what can i do ?
dean , have we forgotten that your school
is under the ac repair school &apos;s thumb ?
uh , we have not .
then mine is not to tell you how to do what i want done .
mine is to want
and to say my want .
yours is to know and to do .
i know exactly what to do .
natalie , could you get me a , um , book on how to do things ?
you know what , just make me a scotch and soda .
make it yourself !
i don &apos;t know how .
i love blade &apos;s special blade weapons .
yeah , see that sword ? it has two blades .
one blade is silver ,
the other blade is infused with garlic .
i should check my messages .
no .
guys , could we maybe watch a different movie
or just stop saying that word six times per minute ?
what word ?
blade .
oh , because of britta &apos;s ex @-@ boyfriend .
can you check my messages for me
and tell me if he called ?
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s a good idea .
what if my mother died ?
you guys are really talking over blade .
not cool !
annie , subdue your guest .
annie , think for one second .
you have my phone , and you &apos;re not even checking it .
what if my mother is dying ?
this is junkie talk .
you just wanna know where your phone &apos;s hidden .
i just wanna know if my mother is dying .
it &apos;s a simple yes or no . i &apos;ll cover my eyes .
you go check my phone and say ,
&quot; no , your mother isn &apos;t dying &quot; or &quot; yes , your mother is dying , &quot;
and then we go back to watching the film .
give it to me !
that &apos;s right , britta . it &apos;s a banana .
why is there a banana in your dvd cabinet ?
read the banana , britta .
&quot; you are a lying junkie . &quot;
i &apos;m sure those words hurt .
but you wouldn &apos;t be reading them if they weren &apos;t true .
i am so weak .
but we are not defined by our limitations .
we are defined by our potentials .
i have the potential to watch blade .
you two are bad friends ! bad .
that &apos;s unfair . what about you guys ?
okay , you don &apos;t like our movie , we can &apos;t say the word &quot; blade , &quot;
there &apos;s phones in the refrigerator .
oops .
troy , abed !
let me see if he called !
i have a right to know ! you &apos;re monsters !
you &apos;re hitlers ! you &apos;re racist pedophiles !
you &apos;re the opposites of batman !
you don &apos;t know what that means .
gonna rip out your throats and eat your--
still think the lock was overkill ?
no .
there &apos;s phones in the refrigerator .
it &apos;s you .
boys &apos; night !
i need help reacting to something .
remember it &apos;s just a quick peek at blade .
you tell anyone we did this ,
i will stop letting you do things with me
i &apos;m afraid to tell anyone about .
hey , i get it .
you wanna take a look at britta &apos;s ex @-@ boyfriend .
if you did it by yourself , you &apos;d be weird .
you &apos;re the only one that really understands me .
oh , funky .
what , are you guys on a date ?
pretty awkward . look what pierce won me .
what is this ?
i decided to go outside the group for a best friend .
and you couldn &apos;t do better than chang ?
you take that back !
he could do plenty better than me .
i was the first to say yes .
well , have fun forcing life .
we will .
what do you wanna do next ?
cotton candy ?
russian roulette ?
what did you say ?
cotton candy sounds great .
oh , thank you .
that &apos;s it ? huh .
hmm . he &apos;s not as good @-@ looking as you .
i wasn &apos;t fishing for that .
no , no , no .
i offered it freely . come on , i wanna go on a ride .
this is a window for me .
i spent my carnival years pregnant .
shirley , i &apos;m not jealous .
i just wanted to see what the deal was .
obviously the deal is he &apos;s a dirtball ,
britta hates herself , voila .
what do you wanna do ?
i &apos;d like to go on a ride .
let &apos;s go shoot some ducks .
jeffrey !
eight of clubs . i win .
nice !
how are you feeling ?
good .
great , actually . thank you , annie .
i could &apos;ve never done this without you .
i &apos;m glad to be able to help you .
i want you to know--
and i &apos;ve never said these words--
but i &apos;ve always felt them .
you &apos;re a sister to me .
britta !
hey , little sis ,
do you think you could trust me to have my phone back now ?
i &apos;ve got my email on there ,
my calendar , homework assignments .
i &apos;m kinda screwed without it .
you &apos;re not just manipulating me , right ?
oh , because of-- oh , jeez .
yeah , whatever . that &apos;s over , annie .
seriously .
okay , i have it right here .
it &apos;s a gateway to further trust .
perfect . thank you .
love the gateway . honoring the gateway .
i have to call my doctor for some results .
don &apos;t worry , i &apos;m fine . it &apos;s just a little personal .
you need privacy , sure thing . i &apos;ll check on you later .
bye . thank you , sweetie .
boy , this guy doesn &apos;t give vampires
a square inch of leeway .
he &apos;s harsh .
what &apos;s wrong , annie ?
you came out of the bedroom smiling ,
and then your smile faded as you leaned against the door .
i gave britta her phone .
you did ? why ?
she needs to feel trust to recover , or she &apos;ll relapse .
she &apos;s gonna relapse because you gave her her phone .
no , i secretly switched blade &apos;s number in her phone
to my number .
so if she tries to get in touch with him ,
it &apos;ll come to me .
that &apos;s diabolical .
yeah , you &apos;re just like blade , man .
straight up .
i just hope she can find the strength to--
she &apos;s probably just telling him
she &apos;s ... dying to feel the warmth of his--
are you kidding me ?
she said we were sisters .
i am so sad right now .
and she is so codependent !
and such a bad speller .
nice shootin &apos; . tough luck .
thanks . i &apos;ll go another round .
there &apos;s room in our bed for three bears , right , honey ?
and then some , sugar .
you &apos;re very nice ...
for a man named-- what &apos;d you say it was ? blade ?
yup .
but that &apos;s a carnival name though , right ?
a nom de corn dog ?
why would i have a carnival name ?
your parents named you blade ?
apparently .
well , you seem okay with it .
not much to do about it .
you could change it .
to what ? templeton ferrari iii ?
won &apos;t change how mustard tastes .
i &apos;ll be right back .
won &apos;t change how mustard tastes .
i get it . i see the appeal .
he &apos;s relaxed , he &apos;s cool .
n @-@ not as cool as you .
mr. blade . i want three more rounds .
jeffrey !
not gonna change the way mustard tastes .
oh , and you &apos;re so cool , shirley .
sometimes i am .
how many times are they gonna do that ?
aw , this is it , isn &apos;t it ?
we &apos;re becoming best friends .
i think so . i think so .
* would you let me be your best friend *
* i would call you every day *
oh , my god ! one after the other !
&quot; i &apos;m texting to tell you i &apos;m not texting you any more .
&quot; i &apos;m sorry , i didn &apos;t mean that .
&quot; are you mad at me now ?
fine . i guess you don &apos;t wanna know our two @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
can we please just put it
under a stack of mattresses or something ?
i don &apos;t know . when is she gonna take a hint ?
britta &apos;s attracted to unavailable men .
dean , why are you here ?
ouch .
fine . let &apos;s make him available .
what are you doing ?
ending this .
&quot; leave me alone . &quot;
no !
that &apos;s so much worse .
see ? she stopped .
she &apos;s calling him ?
she was born in the &apos; 80s .
she still uses her phone as a phone .
uh @-@ oh .
that &apos;s fine , it &apos;s fine .
we just won &apos;t answer it .
won &apos;t it go to your voicemail ?
hello ? blade ?
there you go .
i don &apos;t know !
change your settings so it doesn &apos;t go to voicemail .
too late .
you guys act like a carnival . be a carnival .
now !
step right up !
ding , ding , ding !
get your popcorn here .
hello ?
busy , babe .
blade , just wait . wait , bla--
i told you not to call me at work !
&quot; i &apos;m sorry , i forgot .
don &apos;t be mad at me . &quot;
she &apos;s whipped by an imaginary douche .
hey , don &apos;t knock it till you try it .
i got my fake bachelor &apos;s degree ,
and then i cheated on the lsat .
you &apos;re probably wondering ,
how do you cheat on the lsat ?
how ?
a magician never reveals his secrets , my friend .
yeah ! in your face !
good job .
uh , give me the big one ! yeah , that &apos;s the one .
yeah .
not too shabby , huh ?
yeah , you really did it , baby .
so you dropped out of high school
and joined the carnival .
and 15 years later , here you are .
jeffrey !
guess that &apos;s about it .
so what &apos;s the record ?
what &apos;s the best anyone &apos;s ever done in this booth ?
i guess eight ducks .
all right , one more round .
one more round .
jeff ?
honey ?
will you excuse us just for a moment , please ?
certainly .
can you get over here ?
what is your end game here ?
i don &apos;t know .
i wanna know .
wanna know what ?
i wanna know what drove britta crazy about him .
are you jealous ? are you in love with britta ?
no , i am not in love with britta .
and yes , i &apos;m insanely jealous of him .
what &apos;s his secret ?
why do you wanna know the secret to making a woman psycho ?
why do we wanna know how to blow up the earth
or grow a human ear on a mouse ?
in case we have to , shirley .
in case we have to .
i &apos;m going to find pierce .
good !
one of those bears is mine !
so this is best friendship .
something else , isn &apos;t it ?
how do we keep it going ?
how do we know we won &apos;t get into a fight ?
i say we just let it happen .
don &apos;t tell me what to do !
what &apos;s your problem ?
what &apos;s yours ?
i &apos;m outta here !
* this is the last time *
* this is the last time i &apos;ll see you smile *
* good @-@ bye *
* my friend *
* i &apos;ll miss you every night *
* good @-@ bye *
blade , &apos; sup ? message .
okay . we can stop worrying about voicemail now .
back to the matter at hand .
now what are you doing ?
dean , why are you here ?
yikes .
i figured it out . i know exactly what to do .
i &apos;m just gonna be really , really , really mean to her .
what don &apos;t you get about the concept ?
britta likes guys who are mean to her .
she doesn &apos;t like herself .
give me the phone .
what did you say ?
something nice .
don &apos;t worry about it .
i &apos;m deleting it from your phone .
hi .
what &apos;s up ?
you guys still watching movies ?
hi , dean . why are you here ?
hi , britta . and ouch .
and you don &apos;t know anything about carpentry .
nope .
or aquariums--
freshwater or saltwater .
do you have a big weiner ?
nope .
i don &apos;t get it , blade !
what &apos;s your secret ? why do i wanna impress you ?
are you dumb or smart ? are you a loser or winner ?
or are you just a human mirror ?
do we all see what we wanna see in you ?
a magician never reveals , right ?
right .
later .
okay .
you dropped over 300 bucks on my booth , so i &apos;ll tell ya .
you wanna know my secret ?
yes .
yes , i do .
what are you doing ?
i wanna know .
okay , i &apos;m sorry .
i was texting with blade , but it &apos;s over now .
he &apos;s ... a loser .
good night .
troy ! you should really join
the air conditioning repair program .
no .
well , that didn &apos;t work .
that &apos;s what i get for improvising .
good night .
so i don &apos;t get it .
he &apos;s a vampire , but he can walk around during the day ?
what ... is wrong with you ?
huh ?
you weren &apos;t texting blade , you were texting us .
i switched blade &apos;s number in your phone to mine .
you tricked me ?
you tricked me !
you ask for my help , you tell me i &apos;m your sister ,
i do everything i can to make you hate this turd ,
and the first nice thing he says , and you &apos;re over him ?
who are you ?
and why didn &apos;t it stick ?
i was texting with you guys this whole time ?
so blade ... isn &apos;t a loser !
uh @-@ oh .
no , let her go . lost cause , man .
jeff ! what are you doing here ?
i just got back from the carnival ...
where i met blade .
is he okay ? how is he ?
he &apos;s brain damaged .
well , let &apos;s not be petty .
no , i &apos;m serious .
he showed me the scar .
ten years ago , before he even met you ,
a loose bolt flew off a ferris wheel
and imbedded in his skull ,
destroying the part of his brain that feels shame .
he &apos;s basically irresistible to people for the same reason
he can pretty much only work at a carnival .
he has nothing to prove or disprove
about himself or to himself .
he has no shame .
why wouldn &apos;t he have told me that ?
because he didn &apos;t care if you knew .
that is so like him .
i have to go to him .
no , woman .
none of us have to &quot; go to &quot; anyone .
and the idea we do is a mental illness
we contracted from breath mint commercials
and sandra bullock .
we can &apos;t keep going to each other
until we learn to go to ourselves .
stop making our hatred of ourselves , someone else &apos;s job
and just stop hating ourselves .
annie , i want you to take my phone .
do not let me call chang .
i &apos;m locking myself in your room .
what are you guys doing out here ?
self @-@ actualizing .
well , it &apos;s loud .
come watch blade .
okay .
this movie is fantastic .
y &apos;all ever notice that cold spot in the hallway ?
oh , yeah !
that thing is freezing !
you know what could learn a lesson from that cold spot ?
the air conditioning unit in my living room .
ladies and gentlemen ,
so yesterday , typical sunday .
i was hanging out in my dreamatorium .
this ever happen to you guys ?
i couldn &apos;t remember where i imagined the door .
then i realized i was in an actual bathroom .
uh , no offense , but this material
seems pretty specific to your apartment .
i don &apos;t think it &apos;ll work at an open mic .
y &apos;all ever notice the difference
between me and troy brushing our teeth ?
i brush my teeth like this .
troy brushes his teeth like this .
i do !
i do ! i brush my teeth just like that .
now you know what i &apos;m gonna talk about next .
toaster oven !
it &apos;s from his album .
