we went in the house , there was a guy , he had a gun .

mr. foster ?

your wife &apos;s condition is critical .
she &apos;s my ex @-@ wife .
i &apos;m her domestic partner .
ok . we have our trauma team working on your partner .

her lung collapsed ,
she lost a lot of blood .

let &apos;s give your mom some space , ok ? come on .
let &apos;s go over here and sit down .
why didn &apos;t you call or text me back ?
i wasn &apos;t at ana &apos;s house .
well , i didn &apos;t know that .
this never would have happened - if you &apos;d just told me where you were .
don &apos;t pin this on me .
you brought ana into our lives .
she &apos;s stable .
we need to get her up to imaging
but you can see her briefly .
can i come ?
mike .
only the significant other right now .
it &apos;s ok . go .
you know you can &apos;t see stef
until internal affairs has gotten both your statements .
come on , there can &apos;t be any question . it was a clean shoot .
but there are other issues at play here .
like what the hell you two were doing
at that house in the first place .
hey . i &apos;m here .
the kids are ok . jesus was ...
he &apos;s here with mariana and brandon .
we &apos;re all here .
演唱者 rosie and me
sorry to keep you waiting .
hi , i &apos;m lena adams , the assistant vice principal .
hi , i &apos;m stef foster .
so , your son ... brandon .
brandon ... brandon . right .
he will be starting kindergarten this fall ?
yes . he &apos;s five .
great . well , i would be glad to give you a tour ,
tell you about our school .
are we waiting for your husband to join ?
uh , no . he &apos;s not ... he ... he couldn &apos;t make it .
i &apos;m sorry ... ok .
well , um ... follow me .
ok .
so , she &apos;s ... she &apos;s good .
she &apos;s ... she &apos;s opened her eyes .
and she &apos;s going to be ok .
they asked if we would move up to the second @-@ floor waiting room .
excuse me . we need to get mrs. foster &apos;s insurance information .
it &apos;s &quot; ms. &quot;
do i have to do that right now ?
i &apos;m sorry .
why didn &apos;t mom have her vest on ?
we didn &apos;t expect things to go down like this .
isn &apos;t that the point ? to be prepared for anything ?
mike . i.a. is here .
i &apos;ll be back .
brandon , don &apos;t .
what the hell is wrong with you ?
i thought you didn &apos;t want anything to do with your birth mother .
that she was a drug addict and a con artist .
i was just trying to help her .
and look how that turned out .
we took you in when no one else wanted you .
when that woman abandoned you .
and this is what you do ?
brandon , stop .
because of you , my mom is in there fighting for her life !
she &apos;s our mom too .
and you , you started all this .
back off . she feels bad enough .
she should feel bad .
brandon , walk away .
he didn &apos;t mean all that . he &apos;s just scared .
we were there on a personal matter .
yet you were in uniform .
i didn &apos;t have time to change .
but once you got there , you entered the house on police business ?
yeah , when we saw drugs in evidence . but mostly we were worried
that stef &apos;s son might be in imminent danger .
even more reason to call for back @-@ up .
unless you had another agenda , like ...
abusing your position as police officers to intimidate
this birth mother who just wanted to see her kids .
they &apos;re not her kids .
they were adopted by stef and her partner .
your wife &apos;s a lesbian ?
my ex @-@ wife ,
and what the hell is wrong with you ?
we &apos;re just trying to understand the dynamics involved .
you want to understand something ? one of our own was gunned down !
are you guys done here ? my officer &apos;s been through a lot tonight .
just one more thing . you said she was conscious .
after she was shot ?
yeah .
she tried to talk , but i told her not to say anything .
until officer stef foster is able to speak to us ,
he &apos;s not to see or talk to her .
i will have two officers to stay with him at all times .
i &apos;m not gonna do anything stupid .
it was a clean shoot .
then you got nothing to worry about .
where is everybody ?
they &apos;re coming up .
so i knew mariana was in touch with her birth mother .
i just ... i thought it was just a one @-@ time thing .
to give her money .
so you knew mariana was the one selling jesus &apos;s pills at school ?
i should have come to you guys .
i just ... i wasn &apos;t thinking . i didn &apos;t think ...
this is what happens when people don &apos;t think .
where &apos;s jude ?
he &apos;s at his friend connor &apos;s , spending the night .
does he know ?
i don &apos;t think so .
it &apos;s probably better if he doesn &apos;t .
hey , did they find ana at the women &apos;s shelter ?
uh , she wasn &apos;t there .
the people said she came in , but she left pretty quick .
did you give any money ?
just what i had on me . like , 16 bucks .
ok , well , she won &apos;t get far on that .
we really screwed up .
it &apos;s ok .
did you shoot him ? ana &apos;s boyfriend ?
yeah .
is he dead ?
yeah .
good .
when someone gets killed ,
it &apos;s never good , no matter what they did .
ok ?
miss adams ?
hi , i &apos;m dr. aldicott .
i &apos;m the attending surgeon on your partner &apos;s case .
how is she ?
well , the good news is , beyond the lung ,
there wasn &apos;t damage to any other vital organs
oh , thank god .
ok . what &apos;s the bad news ?
the bullet &apos;s resting near the spine ,
which in itself isn &apos;t cause for concern .
however , if any fragments migrate into the spinal canal ,
there &apos;s a risk of neurological damage ,
so she &apos;d need surgery to remove them .
damage , like paralysis ?
it &apos;s a possibility .
can we see her ?
he &apos;s our son .
yeah , but briefly .
and she &apos;s in icu , so immediate family only . ok ?
i can take you now .
you guys , mom has a tube in her throat .
it looks scary , but it &apos;s just there to help her breathe . ok ?
callie ?
i &apos;m ... i &apos;ll wait here .
ok .
演唱者 captains &amp; captives
honey , we &apos;re all here .
brandon , mariana , jesus .
you &apos;re doing really great . and we love you .
all right .
brandon .
i want you to take everybody home so you can get some sleep .
i want to stay . what about dad ?
your father &apos;s got enough on his plate . i need you to step up .
and , uh , bring me some clothes when you come back in the morning ?
mariana , jesus , brandon is in charge .
brandon took the twins home .
i &apos;m trying really hard ...
... to forgive them .
i &apos;m sorry i &apos;m not doing a better job .
what &apos;re they in for ?
armed robbery .
seriously .
their foster parents dropped them off .
said they couldn &apos;t take care of them anymore .
we &apos;re waiting for cps to come get them .
hey , guys , my name &apos;s stef . what &apos;s yours ?
i &apos;m jesus and this is my sister mariana .
jesus and mariana . you brother and sister ?
or is this your wife ?
well , i &apos;m sure you guys probably don &apos;t like candy .
but i just ... i don &apos;t know . just in case ...
what &apos;re you doing ?
mom &apos;s been asking us to go through
this stuff so she can make room in the closet .
i remember this .
my &quot; nite @-@ nite ! &quot;
you dragged this thing everywhere with you .
you would scream your head off if i even touched it .
moms gave us this at our adoption day .
&quot; we didn &apos;t give you the gift of life ,
but in our hearts we know
the love we feel is deep and real ,
as if it had been so .
for us to have each other ,
is like a dream come true .
though we didn &apos;t give you the gift of life ,
life gave us the gift of you . &quot;
what if they don &apos;t want us anymore ?
hey .
you scared me .
sorry . i saw the light on .
i don &apos;t know what clothes to bring lena .
let me .
do you remember what you told me ,
how your moms asked you if jesus and mariana
could come and live with your family ,
you said yes ,
because you figured there was enough to go around .
yeah .
you don &apos;t know what &apos;s it &apos;s like to not have enough .
to not be wanted .
so that means i don &apos;t have a right to be angry ?
no . it means you don &apos;t know what it &apos;s like to wonder why .
why the people that brought you into this world ,
the people who were supposed to love you more than anyone else ,
didn &apos;t .
so don &apos;t be a jackass .
i &apos;m sorry i &apos;m an ass .
i &apos;m sorry you &apos;re an ass too .
look , you &apos;re my brother ...
and you &apos;re my sister , and our moms are our moms .
what are you doing ?
it &apos;s the middle of the night .
ask who it is .
who is it ?
it &apos;s jude .
what are you doing ?
i couldn &apos;t sleep so i came home .
you walked here in the dark ?
it &apos;s not that far ,
and i didn &apos;t want to wake connor or his parents .
what about when they wake up and find you gone ?
i left a note .
they told me what happened to stef .
i just wanted to be with everyone .
i &apos;ll call them . don &apos;t ever do that again , ok ?
we should all try to get some sleep .
callie . are you awake ?
i am now .
this reminds me of our mom .
i know . me too .
is stef going to die ?
no .
this family is not like ours .
they &apos;re lucky .
go to sleep .
hey . you sleep ?
not really .
you ?
same .
what &apos;re you making ?
biscuits and gravy .
you &apos;ve never had biscuits and gravy ?
no .
it &apos;s comfort food . my mom used to make it .
so i know you said your mom died ,
but i don &apos;t think you ever
said why you and jude ended up in foster care .
you don &apos;t have to tell me .
i just realized i don &apos;t really know your story .
it &apos;s not a long one .
um , my mom died in a car accident .
and my dad was driving .
he was drunk .
and he ran a red light and hit another car .
and ...
some people in that car died , too .
so he went to jail for manslaughter .
and there was no family to take us in .
so we went into the foster system .
you know the rest .
is your dad still in prison ?
i guess , yeah .
i used to write him letters , but he stopped answering them .
why ?
do you think he &apos;ll come back for you and jude ?
if he gets out ?
no , i doubt it .
i &apos;m sorry .
not your fault .
it doesn &apos;t have to be my fault for me to feel bad .
i brought donuts .
now , that &apos;s comfort food . thanks , man .
hello ?
oh . ok .
yeah . see you in a bit .
they &apos;re taking my mom into surgery .
so i should get everyone up .
did they say how long she &apos;d be in surgery ?
uh , they weren &apos;t sure .
have you eaten anything ?
i had some toast .
what about you guys ? have you all eaten ?
wyatt brought donuts .
um , do you want to get some air ?
sure .
the only thing you might
take heat for is not calling for back @-@ up .
worst case , a day or two suspension for both of you .
ok . that &apos;s good news .
there &apos;s ... another issue , mike .
it &apos;s your drinking .
come on .
i &apos;ve never had a drink on the job .
yeah , but your after @-@ hours drinking
is affecting your work performance .
i &apos;m really hoping that this is a wakup call for you .
so you saying it &apos;s my fault stef got shot ,
because i had a few drinks the night before ?
i &apos;m not saying that .
but you did put a band @-@ aid on the problem before .
that was during the divorce . it was a bad time , captain .
your partner got shot , and you just killed a man .
ok . ok .
ok , i &apos;ll take care of it .
thanks .
right now i need a cup of coffee .
and i don &apos;t need two babysitters .
演唱者 bill gordon
thanks .
are you ready to order ?
i &apos;m still waiting for someone .
ok , no problem .
how are you ? sorry i &apos;m late .
look , this separation has been good .
i mean , bad ... but good .
it &apos;s made me realize that
i have not been present in our marriage for a while .
and i &apos;m sorry . our family is everything to me , stef .
i &apos;m going to spend more time with you and brandon ,
i &apos;m gonna communicate .
i &apos;ll even go to counseling . i just ...
i love you .
counseling can &apos;t fix what &apos;s wrong with us .
i thought that &apos;s what you wanted .
you &apos;re a good man and you &apos;re a really good dad .
but i haven &apos;t been happy .
yeah . lately . me neither .
but things were good before , stef .
because i tried to make them good .
but ... but something was missing
because i was not able to love you the way you loved me .
i don &apos;t understand . why not ?
because i &apos;m gay .
i &apos;m a lesbian .
and i &apos;m so sorry for you and for me for ...
... for it taking so long to be able to say that ,
and to accept ... before now .
why now ?
because i met someone .
演唱者 phillip larue
i hate hospitals .
you &apos;re using me .
what ?
it &apos;s ok . i &apos;m not mad .
not exactly . i don &apos;t think you can help it .
how you feel about brandon .
don &apos;t deny it or i will get mad .
look , i get that it &apos;s forbidden for foster kids to hook up
with other kids they live with ,
but it &apos;s not like they &apos;re keeping you . i mean , right ?
you &apos;re just here until they can find you guys a permanent home .
i can &apos;t believe i &apos;m saying this ...
if you &apos;re into brandon , then go for it .
be happy .
i can &apos;t . you don &apos;t understand .
maybe i don &apos;t . i don &apos;t know you that well ,
partly because you don &apos;t make it easy to .
but one thing i &apos;m pretty sure of
is that putting your heart out there scares you a lot more
than getting caught breaking the rules .
if being here , in this situation ,
isn &apos;t proof enough that you &apos;ve got to seize the day ,
then i don &apos;t what is .
where &apos;s wyatt ?
he had to go .
she did great .
we removed all the bullet fragments .
but not the bullet ?
believe it or not ,
it can be more harmful to take them out .
so , in about an hour , we &apos;re gonna move her back up
to icu where you can all see her .
we feel optimistic she &apos;s going to make a full recovery .
thank you .
i &apos;m not doing this .
i &apos;m not getting involved with a married woman .
women like you , you are just passing through .
but this is where i live , stef .
i told mike . and i told my dad and i told all of my ...
well , most of my friends . i told them i &apos;m gay .
i even used the word &quot; lesbian . &quot;
演唱者 odessa rose
i told them i met a woman i can &apos;t live without .
and i belong with you , lena .
that is , if you &apos;ll ...
you had me at &quot; lesbian . &quot;
no , no , no .
no . don &apos;t talk . don &apos;t talk .
will you marry me ?
i thought you &apos;d never ask .
neither did i.
don &apos;t ever scare me like that again .
um , how are my babies ?
they &apos;re ok .
they were scared .
and mariana ?
演唱者 marie hines
remember , before this ,
when i asked you why you went behind our backs to meet with ana ?
yeah .
well , i &apos;ve been thinking about that and i realized ...
i don &apos;t think you even know why .
i think ... what you were craving
was more than just some supervised visit with your birth mom .
you were wanting a relationship
with the woman who gave birth to you ,
who you look like , who ...
who had it together now , and ...
and regretted not being able to keep you .
i know it must be hard to understand how your birth mom
could have chosen drugs over you and your brother .
i don &apos;t understand it .
all i know is ... we chose you .
and you chose us .
dna doesn &apos;t make a family .
love does .
we love you .
and that is never gonna change .
hey . there you are .
hey . what &apos;s up ?
i heard about stef . that &apos;s great news .
yeah . so they picked up ana downtown .
they &apos;re gonna bring her back here to id her boyfriend &apos;s body .
she &apos;s saying she was there ,
at the house , at the time of the shooting .
no , she was with jesus .
she says she climbed out a bathroom window .
the women &apos;s shelter was close by . so if she ran straight there ,
it &apos;s possible .
you &apos;re saying she met jesus knowing her boyfriend
just shot his mother ?
point is ,
if she was there , she was a witness .
if you have anything else you want to add to your statement , now would be the time .
we were sweeping the house .
i cleared the first bedroom , and then entered the second .
it was dark . um ...
and i heard movement from across the room ...
... and a gun shot , and ... and i was hit .
officer foster said you tried to speak ,
but he told you not to and called for back @-@ up .
i ...
the first thing i remember was being in the ambulance .
ok . that &apos;s enough for now .
get some rest .
hey .
i want to talk to you .
what &apos;s there to talk about ?
brandon , do you have any idea
what i &apos;ve been through in the last 24 hours ?
do you have any idea what we &apos;ve all been through ?
you were drinking while mom was in surgery .
you know who does that ?
an alcoholic .
don &apos;t walk away from me .
get away from me !
brandon !
i am done with you !
what is going on ?
nothing .
come on . everybody &apos;s tired .
if you ever go near my kids again ,
it &apos;ll be the last thing you do .
let &apos;s go home .
how you feeling ?
never better .
look at the bright side ,
you &apos;ll never walk through a metal detector again
without setting it off .
oh , great . hand searches ?
my favorite .
it wasn &apos;t your fault .
i shouldn &apos;t have let us go in there .
we should have waited . called for back @-@ up .
you know i wasn &apos;t gonna wait .
i thought jesus was in there .
i &apos;m sorry . i wish it had been me .
me too .
ow ... ow , i can &apos;t laugh .
they , uh , they picked up ana .
oh , yeah ?
yeah . she said she was there .
at the house ? where ?
the bathroom .
so she saw the shooting ?
doesn &apos;t matter . it was a clean shoot .
the guy had a gun , he shot a police officer .
he got what he deserved .
she &apos;s probably lying anyway .
