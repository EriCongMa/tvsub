i &apos;m cutting you off . you &apos;re over @-@ caffeinated .
hey , brenda , can i grab you for a second .
come see me next week if you need more .
i signed the agreement .
my dad manipulated you into signing it .
my mother didn &apos;t kill herself .
it &apos;s over .
all i know is that alison is running out of money
and shaun is the only one who knows how to reach her .
i &apos;m tired of lying .
you have to start thinking of me
as the person you &apos;re closest to .
oh , a night in tunisia .
forgot the chickpeas .
oh , i can run down to seymour &apos;s .
are you okay , i mean , it &apos;s like an hour there and back .
mr. fitz .
walk away , spencer .
i think we &apos;re being watched .
ezra .
i &apos;m sorry . i didn &apos;t mean to scare you .
you think she started up with ezra and didn &apos;t tell us .
has she told you ?
told me what ?
aria .
ali &apos;s journal .
you &apos;re saying that ezra left that book for us to find .
which means he knows we know .
we have to tell aria .
spencer ?
spencer ? are you alright ?
how long have you been here ?
i don &apos;t know .
did you sleep here ?
i don &apos;t know ...
i-- i came in here .
hey , take it easy .
let &apos;s talk for a second .
i &apos;m fine .
i &apos;m just really tired , that &apos;s all .
spencer ?
we both know what &apos;s going on here .
i think it &apos;s time we address the issue ...
don &apos;t you ?
the path you &apos;ve been going down is very dangerous .
i got to go .
what are you wearing ?
it &apos;s nothing , i ... i had to change .
and this is all i had in my gym locker .
did you ?
did you have an accident ?
what ? no .
or are you going to ?
what &apos;s up with those shower shoes ?
can you just forget about the outfit , okay .
we have an emergency situation here .
is that why you called me at 4 a.m. ?
wait , what ?
okay , i thought that after we saw aria
liplocking with the devil
went home to calm down and crash .
i ...
i must &apos;ve just hit dial while i was asleep .
look , okay , i know we said
we were going to talk to aria after school ,
but i really think we need to tell her about ezra sooner .
like , now .
what ?
spencer , we can &apos;t tell her now .
the longer we wait , the more dangerous it becomes .
and you think it &apos;s any less dangerous
to drop a bomb like that while she &apos;s going into class ?
we can &apos;t do that to her .
do what ? protect her ?
ezra spoke to me this morning
and i could barely maintain eye contact .
meanwhile , for all we know right now ,
aria is hooking up with him in some janitor &apos;s closet .
how does that not make your skin crawl ?
it does .
look , i know you don &apos;t want to keep her in the dark .
okay , but this isn &apos;t going to be easy .
she &apos;s in love with him
and she has given up a lot to be with him .
i mean , it &apos;s going to be difficult
enough for her to believe he &apos;s even capable of this .
aria ?
you had a question about the--
the reading assignment for the week ?
oh , yeah .
i was just wondering how much information
we have to turn in for the exam .
i know you have history right now ,
but i can write you a late pass--
that &apos;s okay . what &apos;s up ?
have you talked to spencer today ?
no . no . why ?
i feel a little strange coming to you with this .
did something happen ?
all things have started to ...
pile up .
the homework spencer &apos;s turning in is sloppy and rambling ,
she walks in every morning with circles under her eyes ,
i mean , when she &apos;s in class , she &apos;s either hyper alert
or she &apos;s a total zombie .
yeah , i mean , i &apos;ve noticed
that she &apos;s been little out of it lately .
but she &apos;s had a lot to juggle .
and you know spencer , she &apos;s a total stress @-@ case .
a garbanzo bean in the wrong salad bin
is enough to make her her wig out .
right .
i think it &apos;s more than that .
like what ?
she has a problem with amphetamines .
and i &apos;m worried it &apos;s become a crutch .
what ?
ezra , that &apos;s crazy .
well , people think it &apos;ll improve their academic performance ,
but when it &apos;s overused--
ezra , come on , spencer ?
she &apos;s got everybody fooled , aria .
your friend is a ticking time bomb .
and when she explodes i don &apos;t want you to get hit by the shrapnel .
i &apos;m sorry , i can &apos;t believe it .
you really think that she &apos;s on drugs ?
i don &apos;t think it . i know it .
i wasn &apos;t going to show you this .
i guess i &apos;m willing to break the rules
if it means helping spencer .
aria , i &apos;m not trying to be the bad guy here .
these are hanna &apos;s clothes .
so long story .
you want to tell me about it while we go for a ride ?
i would love to , but i &apos;ve this quiz
right after lunch on the french succession of popes .
and right now the only thing i know about them
is that they wore pointy hats .
i brought us some food .
are you still mad at me for taking the money ?
no , i was never mad at you .
disappointed .
i was , maybe a little .
well , i don &apos;t think my mom would have been disappointed .
i think she would have wanted me to live my life .
find a way to make it full
and share it with the people i love .
you want to start by sharing a sandwich ?
yeah , sounds good .
are you gonna eat that ?
yeah , i told you that like five seconds ago .
just take it .
thank you .
sorry . i just get ...
i just get extra hungry when i &apos;m nervous .
i thought it was sad .
i get sad when i &apos;m nervous .
look , i &apos;ve been avoiding aria all day .
like i haven &apos;t .
i finished my spanish homework in a toilet stall .
are you sure this a good idea ?
i mean , what if we tell aria ,
ezra &apos;s &quot; a &quot; and then she hates us ?
what choice do we have except to prepare for things to get ugly ?
finally .
is there some cellular dead @-@ zone that you can know about in the school ?
what do you mean ?
well , i &apos;ve texted you both like five times .
whatever , where &apos;s spencer ?
i haven &apos;t seen her .
okay . well , we need to find her and talk to her right now .
what about ?
right , i think we all know that spencer &apos;s been a little ...
extra @-@ intense lately .
and i &apos;d just chalked it up to stress ,
but she &apos;s not distressed .
she &apos;s strung out .
you guys , spencer has a serious problem .
all right , and this isn &apos;t the first time that has happened .
two years ago it was enough of an issue
that her parents had to ask the school for help .
look .
is that okay ?
i &apos;m just really tired .
why don &apos;t you come over tonight ?
i &apos;ll get us take out from bucali &apos;s .
rent a movie .
maybe even throw a massage in there if you &apos;re good
and you finish all your lasagna .
that sounds amazing , i just ... i can &apos;t tonight .
then tomorrow .
we need some time together .
i know .
that &apos;s okay . i got that .
thank you .
i &apos;d almost forgotten your smell .
see you later .
okay .
okay . two diets and a regular , right ?
oh my god .
you guys did it already , didn &apos;t you ?
did what ?
nothing .
we &apos;re not here to talk about that .
we &apos;re here to talk about ...
something else .
spence , we &apos;re concerned .
yeah , i know . we &apos;re concerned .
no , we &apos;re worried about you .
me ? why ?
are you a speed freak ?
hanna .
spencer .
have you been taking pills to stay awake ?
where is this coming from ?
what the hell is happening right now ?
we care about you .
yeah , would you ... and that &apos;s why we &apos;re here .
right , this is kind of like an intervention .
yeah , i know . yours .
spencer , stop .
we know this has been problem for you before .
i don &apos;t know what you guys are talking about .
where &apos;d you get this ?
ezra .
he &apos;s worried about you .
you &apos;re kidding me , right ?
and you two didn &apos;t tell her ?
he &apos;s &quot; a , &quot; aria !
ezra is board shorts .
he tried to kill ali
and he &apos;s been torturing us ever since .
spencer , can we please stick to the subject of you for right now .
how can you not see what &apos;s happening right now .
he &apos;s trying to undermine me .
he &apos;s being &quot; a &quot; !
please tell me you see what &apos;s happening here .
ezra said that he found you passed out in school today .
that you were barefoot , you were in your pajamas ,
and you didn &apos;t even know where you were .
spencer , is that true or is it not true ?
spencer ? talk .
yes . okay .
i slept walked .
to school ?
yes .
and i &apos;ve taken a couple of pills a few times .
and it &apos;s not great , i know ,
but it &apos;s not that big of a deal .
and ezra is just trying to make it into a bigger deal
than it is because he &apos;s trying to get the focus off himself
because he &apos;s freaking &quot; a &quot; !
oh , my god . this is brilliant .
all right , i know that you &apos;re feeling cornered .
oh , god , aria .
will you wake up ?
this is exactly the kind of
deer in the headlights behavior that almost got you shot
in the back of a night club .
what night club ?
i mean ... i am ...
okay , i &apos;m confused ,
but the point is that i &apos;m not crazy , okay .
you just don &apos;t see .
how can you guys not see what &apos;s happening .
i can &apos;t deal with this right now .
wren ?
he &apos;s your hook @-@ up ?
why did you just swipe the pad ?
it &apos;s not mine .
i &apos;ve never even seen that before .
i bet you are a cute baby .
oh , not really .
i had to start wearing corrective lenses when i was still teething .
yeah , that sounds adorable .
no , it really wasn &apos;t .
no , i cannot believe i admitted that .
i must really like you .
like ?
i was ...
was kind of hoping you &apos;d say that other word .
the one that rhymes with glove ?
i didn &apos;t mean to go there .
i think the candlelight is getting to me .
so do you want to split the steak and fries
or were you more into the chicken ?
mona ?
a steak .
steak sounds great .
i &apos;ll be right back .
i just ... i have to talk to mr. fitz
about a reading assignment .
hello , mona .
what are you doing here ?
i &apos;m getting something to eat .
look .
i can &apos;t help you anymore .
why &apos;s that ?
it &apos;s gotten too complicated .
it &apos;s always been complicated , mona .
that &apos;s a little too late to back out especially now ,
when i need your help .
ezra ?
that &apos;s me .
thank you .
enjoy your dinner .
so did aria text you ?
yeah . she said she &apos;s staying in .
can we believe her ?
why ?
you think she &apos;s going to go see ezra ?
spencer may have an addiction , but so does aria .
love is a drug too .
and who says ezra doesn &apos;t put asria in a--
what do you call it ?
altered state .
yeah , exactly .
i think aria kept her habit a secret , too .
it &apos;s a classic druggie move .
so what are you saying ?
you still think that ezra is &quot; a &quot; ?
there &apos;s too much evidence against him .
we found the book of revelations in his desk .
yeah , but what if that was a plan from the real &quot; a , &quot;
trying to make fitz look guilty .
&quot; a &apos;s &quot; does that .
can i come in ?
please .
that &apos;s all of them .
i don &apos;t need them anymore .
are you sure ?
yeah .
look , i know that my credibility with you guys
kind of got decimated today ,
but ezra is &quot; a. &quot;
i &apos;m sure of it .
maybe you are . but we &apos;re not .
i know that .
and all i &apos;m asking
is for the chance to prove it to you .
i &apos;ve been studying all the changes .
and i think &quot; a &quot; is trying to cover up the place
where he used to meet ali .
the hart and huntsman ?
no . somewhere else .
a place where they can meet and not be seen .
see this ?
&quot; still thinking of ambrose pearson . &quot;
right , but that &apos;s not what it used to say .
originally it said &quot; still thinking of ambrose pavilion . &quot;
&quot; a &quot; changed it so that would sound more like a person &apos;s name
so that instead of looking for a location ,
we &apos;d be searching for a guy .
yeah , some weirdo named ambrose .
right .
so ambrose pavilion is in norristown zoo .
so how does that prove that ezra is &quot; a &quot; ?
it doesn &apos;t .
but &quot; a &quot; already knows that ali &apos;s still alive .
and &quot; a &quot; knows that she never got that money
in the coffee bag that she needed from shana .
so all we have to do is convince him
that ali &apos;s going to meet us at ambrose pavilion to get it .
and you think the person showing up will be ezra .
yeah , i could do dinner if it &apos;s on the early side .
okay , great .
i &apos;ll be leaving in five minutes .
all right , bye .
have you been in your room all day ?
yeah .
it started out as a nap .
i &apos;m leaving to play a round @-@ robin with tricia and joan .
wish me luck .
good luck .
are you still going to join us at the club for dinner ?
oh , i &apos;m totally spaced .
toby really wants me for dinner at his place tonight .
okay , fine .
but at least come up with a better excuse
for me to give next time .
okay .
love you .
love you , too .
good luck .
hey , it &apos;s toby . leave message .
hi . it &apos;s me .
change of plans .
my mom is forcing me to go to dinner
with her country club cronies tonight so .
i might be able to make it by after ,
gonna be on the later side .
i mean , she was just so desperate .
at first she totally denied it ,
and then she just completely flew off the handle .
when i was getting my teaching certificate ,
they had us practice confrontations ,
that could be really difficult ,
people become really defensive .
defensive ?
no , she slid past defense and went straight to offense .
she attacked me , she attacked emily and hanna ,
and she even went as far--
she went as far as to say what ?
she &apos;s just ...
she &apos;s out of control right now .
you know ,
i think it &apos;s time to tell spencer &apos;s parents about what &apos;s going on .
oh , god .
no , i don &apos;t want to have to do that .
if you don &apos;t , i &apos;ll have to .
and it becomes a much bigger deal
if a teacher gets involved .
but can &apos;t we just let her figure this out on her own ?
aria , spencer doesn &apos;t remember driving to school .
she could have killed someone .
i know .
i know that .
but she &apos;s a really strong person .
and i promise you , she &apos;ll get herself out of this .
at what cost ?
do you remember radley ?
yes .
she thought she found toby , dead in the woods .
that &apos;s exactly my point .
seeing a motorcycle helmet and a tattoo
is enough to unravel her completely .
you &apos;re right .
hey .
how did you find out about that ?
the tattoo part ?
what do you mean ?
i mean , how did you know that spencer only saw
the helmet and a tattoo ?
i just don &apos;t think that was included
in any of the reports or anything .
i think you must have told me .
yeah . i probably did .
can i top you off ?
oh , no . i &apos;m good , emily . thanks .
hey . yeah , i can &apos;t talk right now .
can i call you back ?
seriously , now is not a good time .
no , i know , i just ...
i don &apos;t know if i can do it .
we don &apos;t even know if ali &apos;s actually going to show up .
nice . i think he &apos;s listening .
oh , he &apos;s definitely listening .
okay .
now say something like ,
&quot; i know she needs some money ,
but it &apos;s too dangerous . &quot;
i know she needs some money ,
but it &apos;s too dangerous .
tell her to get closer to this mush fries .
just in case he can hear .
just mention the location we &apos;ll go then .
yeah , i heard you .
ambrose pavilion closing .
i got to go .
hi , good afternoon ,
this is veronica hastings
calling on behalf of my daughter spencer .
we were just hoping to refill her prescription today .
if you would , would you please give me a call back at--
you know , actually i &apos;ll just try you back again later .
thank you .
andrew . hi .
hello ?
mrs. hastings ?
yes ?
i &apos;m returning your call from dr. griggs &apos;s office .
dr. griggs ?
i spoke to the doctor
and he &apos;d really be more comfortable
if spencer came in to see him
before he re @-@ ups her prescription .
there must be some mistake
we haven &apos;t seen dr. griggs in years .
i have it here that you &apos;ve called several times .
is that right ?
mrs. hastings ?
thanks . i &apos;ll call you back .
we have less than an hour before closing .
okay . ambrose pavilion .
according to this , we should be right here .
oh , over there .
hanna .
i can &apos;t .
i &apos;m sorry , just looking at the sign
gives me heebie @-@ jeebies .
you &apos;ll be fine . they &apos;re all behind glass .
hanna , come on .
there &apos;s nothing to be scared of .
reptiles first appeared
340 million years ago in carboniferous period .
the snake is so cool .
do you think it eats mice ?
yeah .
the black mamba ...
only ali would think
it &apos;s sexy to make out in front of a bunch of reptiles .
that one is sleeping .
come on .
can you just toss that thing so we can get out of here .
no .
we have to wait for spencer to get into position .
but where is she ?
i don &apos;t know .
she should have been here by now .
what a gyp .
there &apos;s nothing in this one except a log covered in goo .
oh , my god .
the first thing alison ever told me
about herself was a lie .
lying was her oxygen .
she could do it while she was laughing .
she could even do it when she was kissing you .
the zoo will close in 5 minutes .
this is spencer &apos;s plan .
she wouldn &apos;t have gotten it wrong .
there &apos;s spencer .
finally , let &apos;s move .
reptiles first appeared 340 million years ago
in the carboniferous period .
today recognize roughly
8,000 species of known reptiles .
aria ?
aria , i know you &apos;re out there .
why are you hiding from me ?
aria .
aria .
aria !
why are you doing this ?
just come out and talk to me .
please , just don &apos;t do this .
please come out and talk to me .
why isn &apos;t spencer doing anything ?
she &apos;ll make her move when she thinks &quot; a &quot; is here .
and you think that it &apos;s going to be ezra
who shows up ?
guess we &apos;ll find out soon .
okay , once spencer gives us the signal ,
we &apos;ll double back .
god , you guys . i &apos;m so sorry , i &apos;m late .
just help me get this on
and then i can move into position .
the lift is closing in 5 minutes .
aria , aria , aria , i didn &apos;t mean for it to end this way .
damn it !
gosh . she was just here .
who was ?
let &apos;s get out of here .
the black mamba
is the longest venomous snake in africa ...
the brown tree snake is arboreal and rear @-@ fanged .
killer monster emerges from hibernation .
green anaconda is the largest snake in the world .
reptile black mamba
is the longest venomous snake in africa .
no , emliy don &apos;t !
the zoo is closed to general public .
you have to leave .
sorry .
we got locked in . we &apos;re going now .
the anaconda is the largest snake in the world .
help ! somebody help me !
stop , stop . please , please , i know you &apos;re upset ,
but just hear me out .
don &apos;t touch me .
why did we stop ?
i know what you saw back there , and i can explain it .
you knew alison . you knew her .
you pretended not to , and you &apos;re ...
yes , yes . i know , i lied .
i &apos;m so sorry .
i wanted to tell you so many times , but i was afraid .
i was afraid that you wouldn &apos;t forgive me .
i met alison in college .
she lied about her age and i believed her .
i don &apos;t want to hear this . i don &apos;t want to hear it .
i just want to get off .
aria , please , just listen to me .
nothing you say will change anything .
i don &apos;t even know who you are .
yes , you do . yes , you do .
you wanted alison dead .
you wanted her dead .
you thought you got her pregnant .
i never hurt alison .
i was writing a book about her .
a true crime book .
a book ?
yeah .
when i saw in the papers that she had gone missing ,
i-- i couldn &apos;t stop thinking about it .
i had to get to the bottom of the story .
did you know who i was when we met ?
yes , i did .
i knew who all of you were .
and that &apos;s why i applied to teach at rosewood .
so that &apos;s what i was to you ?
i was research ?
when i saw you in the bar ,
i took advantage of an opportunity
because i wanted to be a good reporter .
i wanted to be the guy
that would do anything for the story ,
but i promise you though ,
i didn &apos;t know i was going to fall in love with you .
don &apos;t .
i &apos;ve lied about a lot of things .
ezra , don &apos;t !
i &apos;ve lied about a lot of things .
but i have never lied to you , not once
about how i feel about you .
when we started getting serious ,
i stopped writing the book .
i started my research back up again when we broke up
and that &apos;s how i knew that alison was still alive .
when i think about how i defended you
to my family and my friends .
and the whole time you were ...
you were using me .
i &apos;m sorry , i &apos;m such an idiot .
i &apos;m such an idiot . i &apos;m a jerk .
but i swear , i &apos;ll burn this , i &apos;ll trash it .
burn it ?
burn it ?
are you kidding me ?
i &apos;m going to read this thing from cover to cover .
aria , please don &apos;t .
no .
no , i want to know what was worth
destroying everything we had for .
look .
no !
i was going to say you missed half the movie ,
but that was like 20 minutes ago .
i &apos;m sorry .
kind of lost track of time .
well , can we watch the rest ?
i don &apos;t mind being a little lost .
well , you won &apos;t be .
movie is about a creepy guy who makes creepy sculptures
and acts creepy about it .
i &apos;m gonna get a refill .
you want something ?
no , thanks .
aria ?
are you okay ?
toby .
hey , what are you doing here ?
your mom was worried about you .
why would my mom be worried about me ?
she called me , looking for you .
i wish you could have told me what was really going on ,
instead of me finding out this way .
spencer ? is that you ?
i guess i &apos;ll give you guys some time to talk .
this is for you .
there was a whole dinner that went with it , but ...
doesn &apos;t matter .
wait , toby . can you just wait a second ?
i wasn &apos;t trying to ditch you .
goodbye , toby .
thank you for coming over .
good night , mrs. hastings .
mom , why did you ask toby here ?
you promised .
you promised you wouldn &apos;t go back to this again .
go back to what ? i don &apos;t know what you mean .
spencer , stop it .
dr. griggs &apos;s office called ,
i know .
mom , i &apos;m sorry .
i can &apos;t go through this with you again .
i just don &apos;t think i have it in me .
it &apos;s not like last time though , i swear .
you didn &apos;t know what you were doing half the time .
and your father and i can &apos;t cover for you again ,
not with radley on your resume .
what &apos;s that supposed to mean ?
i need to call your father . let him know you &apos;re okay .
it sounds like toby had a beautiful evening planned .
it &apos;s too bad you missed it .
