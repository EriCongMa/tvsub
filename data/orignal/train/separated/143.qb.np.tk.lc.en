gossip girl here--
your one and only source
into the scandalous lives of manhattan &apos;s elite .
you got into brown
the letter came while you were away . congratulations .
you said you could call in a favor at n.y.u.
did you mean it ?
i can only get you an interview .
it &apos;s gonna be up to you to wow him .
you got your money . that &apos;s all that matters .
now you can go to yale .
well , i &apos;m going to nuy now .
great . then i &apos;ll see you next year .
oh , my god . you &apos;re nate archibald .
and you &apos;re bree buckley . it &apos;s good to see you again .
i made some new friends , one in particular .
oh . so you are dating someone ?
his name &apos;s scott
and i think you guys would really like each other .
yeah , mom , everything &apos;s great .
i have been waiting all summer for reed to start ,
and tomorrow &apos;s the day i get to do what i came here for .
i know secrecy is a lot to ask for ,
but i really can &apos;t risk making my family
more upset right now .
do not worry . i &apos;m good at secret relationships .
what if your dad didn &apos;t want to see you ? who cares ?
who the hell is he not to want you ?
i would &apos;ve stayed all summer with you .
vanessa , i &apos;m--i &apos;m not changing
i don &apos;t care if you &apos;re rich , which you aren &apos;t , by the way .
if you &apos;re gonna be in this world be yourself in this world .
is there anything else ?
i &apos;d like to request a roommate--blair waldorf
she &apos;s my best friend ,
and i just can &apos;t wait to live with her .
and who am i ?
that &apos;s a secret i &apos;ll never tell .
you know you love me .
x.o.x.o. , gossip girl .
every fall , confident high school seniors transform into
nervous college freshmen .
they leave their parents &apos; homes
for the hallowed halls of higher education .
and like any new venture ,
starting college holds the promise of limitless opportunity .
the opportunity to conquer a new territory ...
or to try and be a little less lonely ...
but just because the opportunity presents itself ...
doesn &apos;t mean everybody is ready to take it .
you &apos;re so sweet to see me off .
i can &apos;t believe n.y.u. orientation week is finally here .
i have to object to you living in the dorms .
fluorescent lighting , communal showers ,
public school girls ?
there &apos;s a place for that ,
and it belongs in the back of a video store .
it &apos;s not for long .
i can &apos;t rule the n.y.u. masses from the upper east side .
i need to spend time in the dorm
to establish myself as queen .
it &apos;s not constance , blair .
the only queens at n.y.u.
are the ones with tickets to see liza at carnegie hall .
chuck , i trust that when you say ,
&quot; never drink absinthe with daniel baldwin , &quot;
you know what you &apos;re talking about .
but when i say the first week of college means
scared , vulnerable freshmen
needing someone to guide them ,
that i know what i &apos;m talking about
and i &apos;m very excited for you .
so you haven &apos;t called vanessa yet ?
no , she &apos;s the one who is out of line . she &apos;s gotta call me .
or you could just
get over it . afte all these years
you guys are finally gonna be at the same school .
i guess you &apos;re right . it &apos;s
to be avoiding my only friend at n.y.u.
for the record , dan , i don &apos;t think
you &apos;re gonna have any trouble making
friends there .
right , because the world of greenwich village intelligentsia
is dan humphrey &apos;s natural habitat .
you &apos;re so lucky. n.y.u. is exactly the right place for you .
like brown is for you .
serena ?
sorry. uh , yeah .
you know what ? i should finish packing .
but good luck , dan .
hey , i &apos;m sorry .
are you dan humphrey ?
uh , yeah .
like the dan humphrey who was published
in the &quot; 20 under 20 &quot; issue of &quot; the new yorker &quot; ?
uh , yeah .
large coffee , please .
i &apos;m katie , and i &apos;m not usually an eavesdropping stalker .
it &apos;s just that i read your piece , and it was amazing .
what ? really ? wow. that &apos;s--that--thank you .
yeah , well , at first i hated you because i also submitted ,
but then i read it and i was like ,
okay , fine . i accept defeated at your hands , dan humphrey .
anyway , i have a writer &apos;s group . we meet every week .
we &apos;re meeting here at noon tomorrow . you should come .
car &apos;s downstairs. you ready ?
as i &apos;ll ever be .
today &apos;s a big day ,
you and dan both off to college .
yeah , i know . i know .
uh , i should get going .
your mom &apos;s so proud of you .
so am i.
hey .
uh , scott , you remember dan . dan , this is scott .
yeah. no , it &apos;s , uh , it &apos;s good to finally officially meet you .
uh , so you two are dating now ,
last i heard you were just friends .
yeah , you actually to call .
to find out what &apos;s going on in my life .
well , okay . i didn &apos;t realize you were speaking .
oh , god .
of course she &apos;s in a limo .
ew .
let &apos;s make it clear from the start .
we don &apos;t know each other here .
works for me .
me too .
well , hello , sis .
i assume you need a few ounces of study aid for brown .
no . i need a place to stay .
i &apos;m not going to brown .
yes , we may all be freshmen and new to n.y.u.
and the dorms , but that doesn &apos;t mean
we have to embarrass ourselves .
i can tell from looking around
this room that none of you are
from new york city .
a ctually , i &apos;m from
riverdale doesn &apos;t count .
anyway , i won &apos;t be holding the sad truths
of your hometowns against you .
in fact , i want to help you . for example , who can tell me
which is the only club to be seen at
on a saturday night .
keys
wrong. you should never be seen
at a club on a saturday night .
it &apos;s strictly bridge and tunnel on the weekends .
you &apos;re welcome. now dorota and i
have put together
filled with essentials for everyone .
think you don &apos;t need a week around the school .
you do it in one day .
i know. this is going even better than i &apos;d hoped .
and the best part is i seem to
have a single .
sorry , i &apos;m late .
blair ?
blair waldorf ? oh , my gosh !
oh , my gosh . i can &apos;t believe it ! we &apos;re roommates !
rah rah , sis boom bah .
georgina &apos;s pulled a cool dita
welcome to college , b .
this is gonna be a blast .
following me to n.y.u. ? becoming my roommate ?
i &apos;m gonna have dorota file a restraining order .
i mean , you &apos;re overreacting .
the roommate thing is just a coincidence .
besides , my parents said it was
either bible or college .
so go , bobcats !
so you &apos;re not in love with jesus anymore ?
oh , i still hold him in my heart ,
but jesus and i have redefined our relationship .
you mean he dumped you
because he found that you were satan .
this could actually be a good thing , blair .
look . manolos. size 7 , just like you .
let me know if you want to borrow .
i &apos;ll win , you know .
i ruled at constance and i will rule here ,
and you can &apos;t stand in my way .
are you still playing the tired old game .
oh , please. like you &apos;re not ?
no , i &apos;m not .
i &apos;m actually here for a fresh start .
oh , no .
vanessa , you &apos;re in our dorm , too ? yay !
your dorm ? yeah , um , my room &apos;s just down the hall .
so , uh ...
that &apos;s awesome .
oh !
isn &apos;t this so pretty ?
i &apos;m gonna hang it up .
oh , miss blair .
what are we going to do ? call police ?
no .
we &apos;re going to throw a party .
i go to masa , see if they will cater .
pardon me .
i was packing and talking to blair about her classes ,
and then it hit me .
i wasn &apos;t excited about any of it .
i don &apos;t know what i want to do yet ,
and ... and going off to a new place to figure that out ?
i don &apos;t know . i &apos;m just ... i &apos;m not ready for that .
look , sis , for people like us ,
a college degree is just an accessory ,
like a malawi baby or a poodle .
well , it &apos;s an accessory my mother really wants me to have .
so you want to hide out at the bass cave
until you figure it out .
yeah , if it &apos;s okay with you. nobody &apos;s know about this .
not even blair. blair would be
even more upset than my mother .
i couldn &apos;t help but notice you and carter baizen
at the van der bilt polo party .
this doesn &apos;t have anything to do with him , does it ?
no , absolutely not. i haven &apos;t even seen
him since then .
good . just one favor .
i &apos;m having a meeting here tonight ,
so if you can clear out for a few hours .
chuck , i don &apos;t mind if your dater comes by .
jesse is in st. barths this week .
this is something more legitimate .
you know the old art deco bank
on 72nd between madison and park ?
the one that went under last month ?
i want to make it into a speakeasy .
in the front-- an elegant restaurant ,
but down in the vault--
an after @-@ hours locale
devoted to indecency ,
disreputable behavior and all manner of debauchery .
a kind of homage to the last time the market crashed .
the harder the times ,
the harder people want to party and forget about it .
chuck. this is really a great idea .
i @-@ i can &apos;t believe blair hasn &apos;t told me about this yet .
she doesn &apos;t know. nobody does .
i just wanted to wait till i was sure it was going through .
you know , my father turned his first profit
by the time he was 22 .
i hope to do it by the time i &apos;m 21 .
let me guess .
uh , women in literature , professor schweik ?
you know i &apos;m a sucker for stories
about scorned women .
i got the same .
i think the universe is trying to tell us something .
i &apos;m sorry. i &apos;m sorry. i should have called you .
no , it &apos;s--it &apos;s okay .
i wouldn &apos;t have wanted to call me either
after the way i came down on you at the party .
um ... so ... scott ?
yeah , he &apos;s--he &apos;s so great ,
and he really wants to get to know you .
oh , my god. i have so much to tell you .
you are never gonna guess who lives in my dorm .
hey , guys .
oh. oh !
sorry to interrupt. i just
saw you , and i thought
so i really just want to apologize
for everything that happened in the past .
i &apos;ve got my meds straightened out ,
and i &apos;m really in a much better place now .
so i come to n.y.u.
hoping for a fresh start ,
and who do i get as my roommate ? blair waldorf .
what ?
i told you we have so much to catch up on. i mean ,
i wish i had some other friends
you guys are--are really lucky to have each other .
anyway , i should go .
okay , this is probably too much ,
but would you guys want to have a cup of coffee with me ?
look , georgina ,
i appreciate that you want a clean slate ,
but i think it would kind of be too much. i &apos;m sorry .
no , of course .
i @-@ i mean , i @-@ i totally understand .
i &apos;d feel the same way. i &apos;ll see you around .
maybe we were a little bit too harsh .
what ? it &apos;s--it &apos;s georgina .
and you &apos;re dan .
and you &apos;re vanessa. this is a fun game .
i &apos;m sorry. i just thought you were
a little bit more forgiving than that .
are you--are you really trying to make me back here .
no , it &apos;s just we want a fresh start and--
and so does she .
okay. i know you &apos;re new to the whole school thing ,
but you don &apos;t want georgina as your friend .
i mean , she &apos;s gonna scare everyone away .
georgina .
hey .
what &apos;s gonna happen next week when we start classes ?
that &apos;s why we have my family &apos;s apartment .
and plus , you know , all this sneaking around ,
making sure the doorman doesn &apos;t see you ,
not answering the phone when my mother calls--
i mean , you know it adds a layerof hotness .
what do you say that our hotness is only purely circumstantial
and that if we were out in the real world ,
we &apos;d like each other less ?
mm. you know that if we really started dating ,
after a few months ,
you &apos;d realize that you hate the way that i laugh ,
i couldn &apos;t stand the way that you chew ,
and then we &apos;d break up .
that &apos;s a very romantic story , you know ,
but ... it doesn &apos;t have to be like that .
care to make a bet ? i got an idea .
i will hole up with you for the next 24 hours ,
and we can fast @-@ forward through the entire relationship .
leave the seat up , sing timberlake in the shower .
ah , watch tv shows you really like
as opposed to ones you &apos;re supposed to like ?
what do you say-- you , me , this apartment ?
let &apos;s get sick of each other .
okay .
as you can see ,
the restaurant would be elegant--
seasonal menu , extensive wine list .
you know , the space is big ,
but i want it to have a more intimate feel .
and how would you be using the vault space ?
it &apos;s perfect for storage .
i have to be honest .
give your reputation , when you made your bid ,
the board was very concerned .
i completely understand .
the neighbors don &apos;t want some raucous club coming in
and disrupting the quiet. and believe me ,
i wouldn &apos;t want to bring that element to the area .
i &apos;ll be right down .
sorry. i &apos;m not here .
my heel broke .
stepsister . i apologize .
my lawyer. excuse me .
sorry for interrupting your meeting .
not at all. we were just finishing up anyway .
oh , are you--are you leasing chuck the bank space ?
mm @-@ hmm .
he has a real vision .
i know. turning the vault into a club--it &apos;s genius .
serena .
excuse me ?
thank you .
cool party. i &apos;m amalia .
i &apos;m glad people understand
the concept of being fashionably late ,
but this is ridiculous.- i think everybody &apos;s
down the hall , watching a movie or something .
what ?
please .
ease up on the toro .
he has to answer to a board , serena .
and board menbers tends not to approve
of clubs with coat check girls who give happy endings .
it was an honest mistake .
when he was talking about your plans--
look , why do you think i asked you to go out tonight ?
because i knew something like this would happen .
fine. then i &apos;ll go .
train wreck .
great job , vanessa .
that was awesome .
oh. hey , blair .
oh , my god. we just finished watching vanessa &apos;s documentary
about this community garden in her neighborhood .
it was amazing .
no , it wasn &apos;t .
yes , it was. i @-@ i mean , vanessa , tears. actual tears .
when that gang member picked up his
first carrot
okay
the cocktail party has officially begun
in the common room. sake tinis .
and is that my invitation being used as a coaster ?
um , thanks so much , blair ,
but we actually just scarfed , like , four pizzas ,
and venassa is about to show us
her bootleg michel gondry videos. georgina , please .
nobody wants greasy pizza and vanessa &apos;s home movies
when there &apos;s a sushi and sake party right in the other room .
did i mention wasabi facials ?
okay , then .
and shut the door ?
spotted--blair waldorf
going from v.i.p. to v.d.
poor blair. how are you going to cure this one ?
morning .
hey .
thanks for letting me crash here last night .
harboring an ivy league fugitive ? i &apos;m your man .
i made you breakfast .
i have to go , but remember , we don &apos;t have any servants here ,
so if you see anybody else in the loft besides me ,
call the police. it &apos;s not the chef .
good to know .
so did classes start already ?
uh , no , just orientation stuff .
but , uh , i did join a literary group .
more people have talked to me at n.y.u. in one day
than my entire four years at st.jude &apos;s .
well , i &apos;m not surprised .
i can totally see why people would love you there .
about brown you really should think about talking to my dad .
he might ramble a lot , he might nervously strum his guitar ,
but , uh , when it comes to fatherly advice ,
i don &apos;t know , he &apos;s pretty much the best there is .
do you want one ?
thanks .
come to the party. come to the party. thanks .
it &apos;s gonna be really fun .
we &apos;ll be there .
oh , fantastic .
oh .
so if you &apos;re not trying to sabotage me , then what is this ?
first you deliberately ruin my sushi party ,
and now you &apos;re making your move .
this paranoia has got to stop blair .
i am not paranoid. i &apos;m right .
why else would you have formed an alliance with vanessa ,
the one person i may hate more than you ?
it &apos;s not an alliance ? it &apos;s friendship
unlike you , vanessa &apos;s cool and people like her ,
more than the weird girl who threw the fish party .
sushi. there was toro .
face it , blair .
once upon a time , in a far @-@ off land ,
you were a queen .
here you &apos;re just a loser who will never fit in .
so you won &apos;t be needing that .
hey , guys. do you want to come to my party ?
you can have one , too. you &apos;re really pretty .
thank you .
rufus ?
hello ?
what are you doing here ?
rufus and i were just catching up .
but i have to prepare for a meeting tonight .
thank you for the waffles .
look , i ...
i don &apos;t know what kind of twisted spin
chuck put on things ,
but i actually wanted to talk to you about this .
rufus , i &apos;m having doubts about going
to brown .
well , i &apos;m sorry about that
but to lie about leaving for college ?
i mean , between the show you put
on for the paparazzi all summer
and the craziness at the polo party last week and this ,
i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on with you .
i know . i &apos;m sorry i lied. i just didn &apos;t want to
upset my mom .
well , at least we agree about that
which is why you can repack your
things and go to brown today
i &apos;ll have a car here within an hour .
as long as you &apos;re in it , there &apos;s no reason
lily ever has to know about this .
or what , you &apos;ll tell on me ?
wow. i feel really emotionally supported
in making this life @-@ changing decision .
it &apos;s not a decision . it &apos;s a mistake
which is why i &apos;m--i &apos;m trying to get you
not to make it .
by threatening me ?
do you know you &apos;re more afraid of my mother than i am ?
you know what , rufus ? go ahead. call her .
you can let her know i &apos;m not going to brown .
thanks for the talk .
what do you want ?
hey. i was wondering if you want to go out tonight .
i thought you were at brown .
no , i &apos;m not .
in fact , after i hang up with you ,
i will be withdrawing my admission .
there &apos;s nobody i &apos;d rather celebrate with .
so are you in or out ?
see you tonight .
no , i &apos;m telling you ,
i learned everything i need to know about women
from judy blume &apos;s &quot; forever . &quot;
can i talk to you ?
uh , yeah. yeah. what &apos;s up ?
i was wondering ...
do you have a date to georgina &apos;s party ?
forget the four horsemen .
the real evidence our world is coming to an end--
blair waldorf needing dan humphrey
to rescue her from social extinction .
you okay ?
i just feel like i got off on the wrong foot here ,
and i want to start again .
so ... thanks for bringing me , humphrey .
oh. uh , yeah. well , you know , i @-@ i would just like to think
that if i needed it , somebody would do the same for me .
although , let &apos;s be honest , we both know it wouldn &apos;t be you .
no headbands in college , okay ?
katie .
hey , guys .
blair , you , uh , you remember katie ?
yeah. cute necklace .
thank you. i love your ...
how--how about i get us all drinks and you two talk ?
just not about high school , please .
what &apos;s up , dan ?
so was everyone at your high school
totally jealous of dan for being such a great writer ?
dan &apos;s a writer ?
oh. hey , dan .
hey. um , listen. i &apos;m sorry about yesterday .
i @-@ i was out of line .
please don &apos;t-- don &apos;t even worry about it .
i mean , you have every right to be upset .
i &apos;m just really glad you &apos;re here. thanks .
okay , so am i really drunk ,
or did i just see you walk in with blair ?
look , you wanted me to give you a second chance .
don &apos;t you think you should give one to blair ?
she &apos;s not looking for a second chance .
she &apos;s looking for a way in .
people like you here , dan , and blair sees that .
i &apos;m sorry. i &apos;ve been the person not welcome at parties ,
and if i &apos;m now on the other side of things ,
i &apos;m--i &apos;m not gonna treat people the way i was treated ,
even if it &apos;s blair .
i &apos;m just trying to look out for you .
trust me. you &apos;re being used .
have fun .
gross !
with your mother &apos;s l.l. bean catalog ?
ugh. a cargo short fetish
definitely goes in the &quot; minus &quot; column .
what are you talking about ? i was , like , 12 years old .
speaking of pants , pass yours over here .
what do you need my pants for ?
because i want to see what &apos;s in them
come on. show me all your secrets .
have a look. it &apos;s just normal stuff .
normal stuff , huh ? all right .
see ?
keys , cell phone .
a boarding pass ...
from london .
don &apos;t tell me
that you &apos;ve been wearing these pants since we met ,
because that really would be gross .
no , i ... if you must know , i kept it .
and he has a sentimental streak .
hey , i thought your theory was that
if we really got to know each other , we &apos;d break up .
maybe i &apos;m revising my theory .
to you . brown &apos;s loss is my gain .
thank you .
you know , when you called , i tried not to answer .
great. chuck bass .
let &apos;s get out of here .
no . come on .
since when do you run away from chuck bass ?
it looks like he &apos;s having a business meeting .
this could be fun .
no way .
serena , carter , this isn &apos;t a good time .
well , then let &apos;s make it one .
what &apos;s wrong , chuck ? aren &apos;t you happy
you know , carter and i were
just sharing our favorite chuck bass stories .
there were so many we had to break them into categories .
what were we up to , international affairs ?
oh , there was a time when , uh , chuck
and the italian ambassador &apos;s son
were asked to leave an amsterdam brothel .
now that &apos;s an accomplishment .
simple misunderstanding .
none of us spoke any dutch .
oh ! my gosh. is this-- is this a business meeting ?
i &apos;m--i &apos;m sorry if you sense any tension .
those two don &apos;t like each other that much
&apos;cause they share the same taste in women .
sometimes they share the actual women .
so what &apos;s this business meeting about , bass ?
still trying to fill your daddy &apos;s shoes ?
yeah , chuck , come on , tell him your idea .
i &apos;m opening a restaurant .
yeah , that &apos;s what he &apos;s telling people .
but downstairs , in the vault , he &apos;s creating a club .
what did you say ? you wanted to redefine decadence ?
you wanted to ruin my deal ,
so you came here
and brought carter baizen as your wingman .
i told rufus about brown
because i was actually concerned for you .
i &apos;m sorry to have wasted your time .
are you insane ? &quot; battlestar &quot; kicks &quot; t.n.g. &apos; s &quot; ass .
what other show on the history of the planet
has been asked to speak at the u.n. ?
oh , perfect. an organization that condemns terrorism
while secretly funding it
hosts a panel for a show that glorifies terrorists .
dude , i can &apos;t even look at you right now .
fine . don &apos;t look .
what do you think ?
trust me . you don &apos;t want to know .
i do. i do want to know .
oh , thank god .
man , i &apos;m really glad you decided to come to the party .
oh , thanks , man. that &apos;s ...
vanessa cares about you a lot ,
and i know that she was hoping you &apos;d come .
yeah , yeah , i know .
there he is .
oh , speak of the devil. hey. to , uh , to fresh starts .
i &apos;m happy you &apos;re here , humphrey .
me , too .
so , scott , you are in big trouble .
i cannot believe you told vanessa to take professor rifkin .
for art in the world .
why ? i mean , i liked him .
dude , he &apos;s totally old school ,
not to mention just plain old .
i mean ,
his lecture notes are literally turning yellow with age .
please do tell .
what other professors are you recommending ?
yeah , let &apos;s hear it , because katie &apos;s gonna have
to weigh in from now on .
i @-@ i &apos;m at a party .
i really don &apos;t feel like taking a test right now .
can you please stop with that noise ?
hi , everyone .
what the hell ?
well , most of you don &apos;t know me .
my name is blair waldorf. but a lot of you know
my roommate , who threw this amazing party--georgina .
georgina !
yeah , i know . georgina rocks , right ?
i mean , it &apos;s funny , &apos; cause i never knew
that a jesus freak could throw such a good party ,
but i guess i was wrong. so , everyone , raise a glass
or a ... plastic cup of foam
to the coolest christian i know--georgina sparks .
oh ... my god .
this is a conversion party .
i can &apos;t believe it . georgina threw this party
and invited all her friends here
to convert the vulnerable freshmen .
it seems that blair waldorf has finally found jesus
and invited him to crash georgina &apos;s party .
carter , wait .
so that &apos;s the whole reason you wanted me to go out with you tonight--
you knew i &apos;d help you screw over chuck .
chuck had screwed me over
or , or at least i thought he had .
i wanted to get him back .
serena ,
listen to you . what &apos;s your deal ?
you &apos;re acting out &apos; cause daddy doesn &apos;t love you ?
is that why you skipped out on brown , too ?
please .
no . i told you how i felt , and you blew me off
until you needed someone to do your dirty work .
it &apos;s time to find a new bad habit ,
&apos;cause it &apos;s not gonna be me anymore .
v.i.p. v.i.p. room at the monkey bar .
monkey bar . can &apos;t wait .
the limo &apos;s waiting downstairs .
we were worried about you . we missed you so much .
i can &apos;t tell you how my heart filled with joy
when we got your call inviting us to share his glory
with all of your new friends .
i didn &apos;t invite you here .
we thought our little lamb had been
lost for good .
i am lost for good .
v.i.p. room at the monkey bar . hope i see you there .
monkey bar . limo &apos;s downstairs .
wait . what the hell are you doing ?
georgina was turning everyone against me .
you were just a casualty in the battle for social dominance .
but don &apos;t worry . your loyalty &apos;s been rewarded .
your name &apos;s on the list at monkey bar. yours isn &apos;t .
georgina wasn &apos;t turning people against you , blair .
you tried to bribe people into being your friend
with sushi parties and gift bags , and nobody liked it .
i don &apos;t need these losers to like me in order to follow me .
fear works better anyway .
dan , you &apos;ve experienced social siberia .
if you want to try something new ,
i &apos;ll see you in the monkey bar .
i didn &apos;t know there was a cool crowd at college .
uh , i think you and i were the only ones
dumb enough to believe that .
hey. so some of us were wondering
if you &apos;re gonna go to monkey bar .
you know ,
just because someone has to be on top ,
doesn &apos;t mean it has to be blair .
now when you get downstairs ,
you &apos;ll find limos waiting to take you to the club .
and no sticking your head out the sunroof .
this isn &apos;t east ridge high school prom .
bye .
hello. hey , uh , excuse me .
could i get everyone &apos;s attention , please ?
hey. hi. hello. i &apos;m dan. i just
want to let everybody know
that , uh , blair waldorf over there
invited some people from georgina &apos;s past
just so she could embarrass her. but you know ,
we &apos;re , we &apos;re all starting college here , and college is
supposed to be a place where you &apos;re not judged
by what you believe or the friends you make .
you &apos;re here to make new friends and start over , right ?
so last time i checked , i mean , i think
i think this party &apos;s pretty fun. yeah ?
yeah .
yeah , okay. so ... who wants to leave with blair ?
all right , and who wants to stay here
and drink cheap beer with me ?
it &apos;s a no @-@ brainer .
thank you. you didn &apos;t have to do that .
yeah , i did .
let &apos;s get a beer .
uh , oh , b. looks like your new flock was just led astray ,
and by dan humphrey no less .
i guess they know a false prophet when they see one .
hi .
you mind if i join you ?
it &apos;s your home .
dan told you i was here ?
i was ...
glad you felt like you could come here ,
that you felt like this was a safe place .
i &apos;m really sorry , rufus .
i never meant for it to get this messed up .
none of it was your fault .
well , i didn &apos;t help matters .
i shouldn &apos;t have blown up at you the way that i did .
so ... talk to me .
well , um ...
i called brown
and deferred for a year .
okay .
it may have been for the wrong reasons at the time ,
i , i think .
well , no , i know that it was the right decision .
i would have just been going
because my mom wanted me to go ,
and while that &apos;s a good reason , that &apos;s not good enough .
you know , i did the same thing .
well , it was rutgers , not brown ,
but i got in and i realized that if i didn &apos;t pursue music ,
i &apos;d never do it .
i wish i had that same sense of purpose .
but i hope that if i take
this time , that i will find it .
gosh .
how am i gonna tell my mom ?
maybe i could help you figure that out .
i know i &apos;m not the first guy
that your mom &apos;s brought into your life ,
but if you and eric will let me ,
i &apos;d really like to be more to you than ...
than just lily &apos;s most recent husband .
let me help you with this .
wow. i , uh ...
i would really appreciate that , rufus .
i &apos;m sorry , mom .
it wasn &apos;t my intention to embarrass you or daddy .
look , i wouldn &apos;t be doing any of this
if i didn &apos;t feel the way that i do .
i really , really like him , and ...
mom , please , don &apos;t be like that .
mom ?
i guess we didn &apos;t fool the doorman .
so you told your mom the truth ?
i didn &apos;t want to risk everything with my family
for some fling that wasn &apos;t gonna last .
but ?
well , if your family can accept us together ,
maybe one day mine will , too .
and if not ?
it &apos;s a risk that i &apos;m willing to take .
there &apos;s a reason we never went downtown--
it &apos;s awful .
the minute you cross 14th street ,
people forget there &apos;s a class system .
b , you will find your place. just give it time .
no , i found my place , and it &apos;s at the bottom .
it &apos;s a point of pride now that i see who &apos;s on top .
anyway , it &apos;s all turned out for the best .
if i hadn &apos;t been so distracted ,
i would &apos;ve been able to force you to go to brown .
that &apos;s sweet , but no , you wouldn &apos;t have .
i am sorry i pulled a disappearing act on you .
i &apos;m sure you &apos;ll find a way to make it up to me ...
in the handbag department at bendel &apos;s .
now normally i &apos;d be more worried about brown ,
but you actually seem a lot better than you have in a while .
i really am .
it was so much easier
when it was just about where we sat on the met steps .
yeah , but we &apos;ve ...
we &apos;ve been here , done this .
but i was so good at it .
well ...
then it &apos;s time for a new challenge ...
for both of us .
i &apos;m glad you &apos;re not going to brown .
i need you here .
same .
bye .
bye , you .
i &apos;m sorry i &apos;m late ,
but i have a good excuse .
what is this ?
a review of all the professors i had this summer .
and look , i even gave &apos; em grades .
wow. this is amazing .
i &apos;m sorry ...
for that weird moment with katie last night .
i think i got a little , um , overwhelmed
from meeting all your friends .
that &apos;s okay .
that was kind of the least weird part of the whole night .
yeah , when dan--he got on the mike
and he convinced everyone to stay at the party ,
that was insane. is he usually like that ?
no. dan is more of a corner @-@ of @-@ the @-@ party guy .
should i call him , see if he &apos;ll join us ?
call him later. i just want to be with you right now .
what do you want , serena ?
there &apos;s a reason i always come back to you , carter ,
and it &apos;s not because you &apos;re my bad habit .
what then ?
you &apos;re the only one who understood
why i needed to find my father .
you were there for me during all of that , and i trust you .
anyone would have done the same thing .
no , they wouldn &apos;t have .
and i don &apos;t want anyone else .
i want you .
you were right about the dorms .
the lighting is awful .
are you okay ?
i am now .
hello ?
hey. do you want to meet me and scott
so we can download about the epicness last night ?
mm. no , you know , i &apos;m still a little wrecked ,
so , uh , i &apos;ll-- i &apos;ll call you later .
okay. bye .
apparently , higher education
doesn &apos;t make for smarter decisions .
so take out your notebooks and sharpen your pencils , kids .
