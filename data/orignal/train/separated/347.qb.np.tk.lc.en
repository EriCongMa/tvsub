you gotta be kidding me .
i can &apos;t take you .
well , how many times have i taken you to the airport ?
matt has a soccer game tomorrow .
i have a report i have to finish .
it &apos;ll only take an hour .
fine . i &apos;ll call a cab .
oh , come on , kyle .
kyle , i &apos;m running out !
come on , rossi .
i don &apos;t want to use them .
i don &apos;t even understand you . it &apos;s a vacation , rossi .
everyone likes vacation .
vacations are overrated .
didn &apos;t you take a vacation two years ago ?
luckily , two days in i was called back .
yeah , and now he &apos;s got 31 days .
a month ?
you know , sunshine is an essential source of vitamin d.
you should go to florida and get some sunshine .
that &apos;s for old guys .
what about a safari in africa ?
too hot .
how about italy ?
too many relatives .
you sound hermetic .
no , rossi just likes his wine and stogies .
and i go crazy if i have nothing to do .
you know , rossi , if you don &apos;t use &apos; em , you lose &apos; em .
thank you . this is what i &apos;ve been telling him .
see this ? this is my &quot; i don &apos;t care &quot; face .
that &apos;s your normal face .
if i were you ,
i &apos;d give your vacation days away to a colleague in need .
garcia , see how many people in the bureau
have spouses in the military serving overseas .
i am on it . altruism is sexy .
yes , it is .
let &apos;s get started .
yes , sir .
all right , crime @-@ fighters .
last night , two victims ,
brenda wipley and mark coleman
were found murdered hours apart ,
one in san diego , one in los angeles .
they were blitz @-@ attacked and they were chained to a car
where they were dragged alive to their deaths .
and the local p.d. does not believe the victims knew each other .
and both received similar text messages last night
from prepaid phones asking them to meet .
so our unsub &apos;s a friend or at least pretends to be one .
based on how they were killed , he wanted to see them suffer .
he &apos;s sadistic .
and mission oriented .
dragging &apos;s usually associated with hate crimes ,
but neither victim was a minority nor gay .
actually , dragging is steeped in english history .
back in the 11th century , drawing and quartering
was a common form of punishment , and in fact ,
they would also disembowel and
behead the victims when they were done with them .
but that didn &apos;t happen here .
maybe this is just a serial killer who crosses city lines .
i don &apos;t know . two victims in 3 hours ? that &apos;s a spree .
our unsub may claim another victim soon .
which is why we &apos;re headed west . we &apos;ll land in orange county ,
half of us will go to san diego , the other half l.a.
wheels up in 30 .
wait . wait . come back ! what did i do to you ? !
please don &apos;t do this !
no !
oh , no , no !

&quot; evil is always devising more corrosive misery
through man &apos;s restless need to exact revenge out of his hate . &quot;
all right , let &apos;s go to victimology .
neither of the victims was sexually assaulted or robbed .
well , brenda was a teacher and a mother of two .
she went to meet a friend that night .
and her husband backs the story .
and the other victim , mark coleman , was an addict .
he was killed in the parking lot of a drugstore
around the corner from the sober living house .
a woman with no apparent addiction issues
and a tweaker in a sober living house ?
they probably don &apos;t know each other .
garcia , did the unsub call the victims
on the disposable cells prior to that night ?
let &apos;s see . in the last few weeks ,
he called each of the victims over two times a day .
that &apos;s not random . it &apos;s hunting .
without phone transcripts ,
it &apos;s going to be hard to understand what the unsub &apos;s ruse was .
well , it ended pretty bad .
tying someone to the back of a car is horrific
and uncharacteristically high @-@ risk behavior .
it was pure torture . skin was scraped off , bones were broken .
that &apos;s about desecrating the body .
well , our unsub is comfortable using chains and hitching equipment .
you know , the crimes could have been committed to promote fear .
all right , just-- can we rewind for a second ?
is it possible to kill someone in san diego
and then drive two and a half hours up to l.a ,
and then do it again ?
if you drove a v8 engine with a single plane crankshaft
80 miles per hour in good traffic ,
you took the i @-@ 5
to the 405 to the 10 east ,
got off on la cienega ,
went right on washington , north on vermont ,
and then snuck up selma using the back alley .
you could do it in an hour , 42 minutes ,
and still have time for tacos .
wow .
yeah .
jj , you and morgan go to the latest crime scene .
dave , you and blake to san diego to the medical examiner &apos;s ,
and reid and i will go to the lapd .
jj .
the blood trail ends about 3 blocks away
where the body was found .
this is where he was tied to the car .
what &apos;s up with the drugstore ?
it was closed friday . they &apos;re in the middle of a remodel .
that &apos;s convenient .
yes . so is the fact that the camera &apos;s not working .
so the unsub drags mark over here ,
then blitz attacks him from behind .
ok , if the killer knew the drugstore was closed
and the cameras weren &apos;t working ,
he wasn &apos;t expecting anyone here .
and he scoped out the nearby streets .
he knew there &apos;d be low traffic ,
so he could drag the victims without being caught .
what if mark was falling off the wagon
and he was meeting his dealer ?
right ? like the first victim
also met the unsub in a parking lot .
maybe she had a drug habit , too .
it &apos;s possible .
but either way , our unsub is highly organized .
hello ?
oh , hi .
i can &apos;t do it today .
i know . i &apos;m really sorry .
next week .
promise .
me , too .
name the place .
hi , i &apos;m detective pratt .
you must be ssa hotchner .
i am . this is dr. spencer reid .
pleasure .
well , i talked to san diego pd .
they sent over everything on the first victim
brenda wipley &apos;s case .
and mr. coleman &apos;s updated file &apos;s on the conference room table .
i &apos;ll start looking them over .
now , should we notify the press that we &apos;re looking for a spree killer ?
not until we know exactly what we &apos;re looking for .
ok . you guys can set up right in here .
thank you .
morgan and jj think that maybe our second victim mark
went to meet a drug dealer .
have you gotten the tox screens back ?
neither of the victims had drugs in their system .
it doesn &apos;t mean they didn &apos;t go meet a dealer .
but a drug dealer doesn &apos;t call you twice a day for two weeks .
usually you call him .
go ahead , garcia .
the path of my cyber sleuthing has had majestic results .
digging into victim number two &apos;s past ,
it turns out meth isn &apos;t the only thing mark coleman had done .
he also changed his last name .
from what ?
logan .
and that &apos;s where the plot thickens like a bad pudding .
so when mark was a junior in college ,
he gets picked up by police on a drug charge .
they find some articles of clothing
of a missing 8 @-@ year @-@ old girl named kelly taylor in his car .
they are covered with mark &apos;s dna .
after a lengthy interrogation ,
he confesses to sexually assaulting her ,
but denies killing her ,
and because her body was never found ,
they couldn &apos;t link him to the disappearance .
what &apos;s he been doing since he got out ?
eating hamburgers .
he got released a month ago .
since then he &apos;s worked at 3 different fast food joints .
send me everything you &apos;ve got on the case .
i &apos;ll have reid go talk to the family .
yeah .
outside .
i was having my soup .
now .
thanks .
garcia was only able to give away 25 of my vacation days
to employees with loved ones in afghanistan .
well , great . now you just have to figure out
what to do with the remaining 6 .
hey . i &apos;m dr. mathis .
i heard it took the l.a.m.e. 4 hours
to find the second victim &apos;s entire body .
yeah , he was spread all over the place .
well , victim one had it easy by comparison .
she was dragged postmortem .
we thought she was alive at first .
no . she died from a series of blows to the head .
so the unsub was scared on his first kill ,
then two hours later when he got his second victim ,
his confidence suddenly evolved .
that &apos;s a pretty quick evolution .
and therein lies the problem .
so i talked to victim number two &apos;s father .
he said as far as he knew , no one was trying
to get back at mark for the rape .
he got out of jail last month .
he was getting out more , exercising ,
trying to get on with his life .
well , i just compared photos from the first and second crime scenes .
the cars used to drag were different .
maybe the killer switched cars ?
or we &apos;re looking at two unsubs .
what did you and morgan find ?
well , at both crime scenes ,
the nearby stores were either closed or being remodeled ,
so the killer would have had to scope the area ,
lure and drag the victim without being caught .
this guy has a lot to do . so the question remains ,
how can you do that twice in one night
in cities over 100 miles apart ?
two unsubs would explain the evolution in m.o.
what did rossi and blake say ?
the first victim brenda was dragged postmortem .
the second victim was alive .
so we &apos;re most likely looking at one unsub who &apos;s hesitant
and another one who actually enjoys it .
what do you mean , you killed her first ?
i just couldn &apos;t do it while she was still alive .
but that &apos;s the whole point .
come on , you know what she did .
i know . but she was begging for her life
and i just couldn &apos;t hear it anymore .
oh , you should have called me .
you had your own thing to do .
ok , we &apos;ve been planning this thing for 6 months .
if you thought you were gonna chicken out ,
you should have told me at last week &apos;s meeting .
ok , we &apos;re done now , so let &apos;s just go home
and pretend this never happened .
no . we &apos;re not going anywhere .
when i killed mark ,
he told me there were two other guys that helped .
what ?
he didn &apos;t do this alone ?
so what are we gonna do now ?
we &apos;re gonna kill them . that is what we &apos;re gonna do .
i can &apos;t do this again !
yes . yes . yes , darlene , you can .
i don &apos;t know ...
darlene , if we don &apos;t do this ,
who else will ?
we know most teams work together , two unsubs versus one victim .
here we have a team that &apos;s 120 miles apart ,
using similar m.o.s on radically different victims .
ok , so how do we think they met ?
something in the victimology should tell us .
well , we know that victim number two , mark coleman ,
has a sketchy background . what if victim number one
was hiding something as well ?
let &apos;s start digging .
who the hell are you ?
you thought you could rape and kill an 8 @-@ year @-@ old
and get away with it ?
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
yeah . that &apos;s not what mark said !
ok . ok . i was there , but i didn &apos;t do anything .
shut up !
i thought if i tried to stop them , they &apos;d hurt me .
imagine how kelly felt .
what are you doing ?
let &apos;s just kill him now .
no , that &apos;s too easy . now get in the car .
you don &apos;t need to do this !
karma &apos;s a bitch , isn &apos;t it ?
i didn &apos;t do anything .
i didn &apos;t do anything .
i didn &apos;t do anything !
no ! god !
help !
come on !
no , no , i didn &apos;t do anything !
help ! please help !
i didn &apos;t do anything ! help !
what did you find ?
paul montgomery was alive when he was dragged .
and it turns out paul worked the late shift nearby .
my officers found blood around his vehicle .
he was probably blitz attacked when he left work .
did we find his cell ?
yeah , it was on the ground .
but he had no text messages or prior calls .
that &apos;s a change in m.o.
usually they lure their victims out .
what happened to their organization ?
garcia , what did you find out about paul montgomery ?
so guess who were bffs in college .
mark coleman and paul ?
10 points to blakendore .
turns out paul was a character witness
in mark coleman &apos;s rape trial .
he waxed poet about his boy . the jury didn &apos;t care .
so we have two scumbags and an innocent mom as victims .
anything in brenda wipley &apos;s past ?
no , not that i &apos;ve found yet . she went to college at ucla ,
she went to high school in orange county .
does she have a sealed juvie record ?
why didn &apos;t i think of that ?
see , this is why you &apos;re the boss man
and i &apos;m the minion who types things .
uh , it turns out brenda was not as coifed as her bob .
when she was 17 , she was involved in a dui
that resulted in the death of a 2 @-@ year @-@ old boy , sam dolan .
did she serve time ?
yeah , she was sentenced to a year in juvie .
it was reduced to two months
after her father gave hefty chunks of change to some political organizations .
so , we &apos;re definitely looking at a vigilante team
avenging the death of these two kids .
we should talk to the parents of the original victims .
i &apos;ll bet they &apos;re the connection to these unsubs .
thanks , garcia .
thank you for coming in , mr. dolan .
that was taken at his second birthday .
his mom sent one to everyone .
i know this is hard ,
but i need to ask you some questions
about the death of the woman who killed your son .
like i told the cops ,
i was returning home from london
the night brenda was murdered .
i have my boarding pass .
ok . now , what about your wife ? where was she ?
she killed herself a few years ago .
i am so sorry to hear that .
she said she was getting better , and--
but ever since sam &apos;s death ,
she was a mess .
do you think the lenient sentence
was a contributing factor in her death ?
absolutely .
she thought the system failed us .
she wouldn &apos;t leave the house after that .
she even did therapy over the phone .
did she have friends over ?
no .
she spent all her time on the internet .
really ?
did she join any online support groups ?
how &apos;d you know ?
she said it was making her better .
but i--i thought it was making her worse .
why ?
because it allowed her to obsess about it .
and look where that got her .
oh , no .
not again .
i can &apos;t do this .
i thought it was gonna help , but it isn &apos;t .
that &apos;s because you &apos;re not letting it .
but it &apos;s wrong .
an eye for an eye ? it &apos;s biblical .
when i wake up in the morning ,
i see kelly &apos;s face .
when i close my eyes , she &apos;s still there .
i don &apos;t know how much longer i can go on like this .
don &apos;t . don &apos;t you say that .
but that &apos;s how i feel .
you should feel rejuvenated .
come here . come on . come on .
look .
look at you .
they did this .
they did this to you .
so don &apos;t tell me they don &apos;t deserve what &apos;s coming to them .
order &apos;s up .
thanks .
just finished my interview .
sam dolan &apos;s father checks out .
his mother committed suicide a few years ago .
what about kelly &apos;s parents ?
we &apos;ve left them messages , but ...
you might send an officer to their house
and places of employment .
we should also check at the support group sam &apos;s mother belonged to .
well , we got something .
the calls the unsub made to the victims-- twice a day at night .
that shows incredible persistence .
the first victim , brenda , was a happily married teacher ,
so why would she take calls from a random man late at night ?
if she was cheating ,
she wouldn &apos;t meet someone at a restaurant near her house .
i think she was meeting a woman .
the roommate said the second victim ,
mark , in a sober living house
said that he was talking to someone online a lot lately .
the night he got killed ,
he got dressed up like he was going out on a date .
and he &apos;s straight , which further confirms it was a female .
that would explain the blitz attacks .
they weren &apos;t because our unsubs were insecure men ,
they were because our unsubs are women ,
who needed to subdue their victims first .
we need to give the profile .
we believe that these unsubs are two women
who are killing people convicted of heinous crimes .
you son of a bitch !
he &apos;ll be out in 10 years .
unlike solo vigilantes , they &apos;re working in concert
and they &apos;re planning and executing coordinated attacks .
their mentality is like a lynch mob .
they believe the justice system has gone wrong
and it &apos;s up to them to set it right .
due to the pre @-@ planning and level of commitment ,
we believe our unsubs are over 30 .
and they probably learned about
the crimes they &apos;re avenging through the media .
it &apos;s possible they were involved in these losses personally
and now feel they need to act .
no ! i don &apos;t accept it !
my baby &apos;s life was worth more than 10 years !
this latest attack felt more improvised and personal .
they didn &apos;t lure their victim .
rather , they blitz attacked him outside of his job .
now , during a spree , the threat is that
an unsub will either strike again or disappear .
now , if they &apos;ve completed their vendetta ,
then the latter is more likely .
our unsubs may not have prior criminal histories ,
as they see themselves as do @-@ gooders .
based on the fact that one victim was dragged postmortem
and the other were dragged alive ,
we believe that one woman is not as confident in the mission ,
while the other is more domineering .
we &apos;re looking mothers , relatives , friends who have lost children .
we also need to look at the collateral damage
of the crimes our current victims committed years ago .
since this is the only thing our unsubs have in common ,
it tell us that as time goes on ,
their friendship will become strained and ultimately fall apart .
so how do these unsubs meet ?
maybe they &apos;re involved in the trials .
in two different cities ?
i don &apos;t know .
if sam dolan &apos;s mom was in an online support group ,
maybe after she killed herself ,
someone else became obsessed with her grief .
yeah , but who &apos;d have that same level of interest ?
let me call garcia .
hey , garcia .
at your service .
were you able to find out anything
about that online support group mrs. dolan was in ?
let me see . it had 200 members .
it was an anonymous group .
did any of them start talking about sam dolan
about two months ago , after his mother &apos;s suicide ?
ok , i &apos;ve got a screen name , ellen r.
from san diego .
she talked about sam in a private chat room .
did sam dolan &apos;s mom
have any friends or relatives with that name ?
yeah , she &apos;s got a sister ellen russel .
she works in a boat shop .
and that &apos;d give her access to hitching equipment .
who was she interacting with in the support group ?
she talked to a lot of people .
in the last year ,
she was mainly talking to a darlene b.
kelly taylor &apos;s mom &apos;s name is darlene .
what &apos;s her maiden name ?
beckett . in the last 6 months ,
most of their discussions have been around the pending release
of mark coleman from prison .
and they probably hatched a plan .
we need to get search warrants for ellen &apos;s and darlene &apos;s houses .
oh , my gosh ! this just in .
so when mark was released a month ago ,
her and ellen started calling him , posing as a friend .
that would explain the disposable cell phones .
that &apos;s the trigger . mark &apos;s release set them off .
yeah , right , great . so ellen was still mad ,
because there was no justice served for her nephew &apos;s death ,
and ... her and darlene must have agreed to swap revenge killings .
and they &apos;d avoid getting caught .
it &apos;s like &quot; strangers on a train &quot;
yeah , but this ain &apos;t hitchcock , folks .
why kill paul ?
he was just a character witness for mark .
a character witness who traveled 300 miles once a week
to see his friend in prison .
friends usually distance themselves from rapists and murderers .
unless you &apos;re involved .
garcia , you and jj look into kelly &apos;s disappearance .
we need to find out how these unsubs got to paul .
and anybody else who might have been involved in the case .
all right , i &apos;ll let him know .
ok . got it .
my officers just interviewed darlene &apos;s ex @-@ husband .
he says she hasn &apos;t been the same since kelly disappeared .
she &apos;s been suffering from chronic depression .
the loss of a child
either brings you together or breaks you apart .
the day she disappeared , kelly left school early
because she and her mother were going on vacation ,
but she never made it home .
they found her underwear in mark &apos;s car ,
which led to his confession .
i got the lab results back from kelly &apos;s rape .
it turns out there was a second dna sample on her underwear ,
but it &apos;s too degraded to make a match .
maybe the women suspected it was paul &apos;s .
san diego p.d. just searched ellen &apos;s house .
she &apos;s not there , but they put an officer out front
just in case she comes back .
so we need to figure out who paul was to mark in college .
they ran cross @-@ country ,
sometimes participating in a relay together .
it means they were close .
don &apos;t 4 people do relays ?
hey , baby girl .
hey .
listen , we need to figure out
who ran in the cross @-@ country
relay with paul montgomery and mark coleman .
bryce phillips and jason nelson .
they look inseparable .
and where are they now ?
bryce lives in amsterdam ,
jason in the los feliz area of los angeles .
and what was jason &apos;s relationship with mark like when he went to jail ?
jason was at the hearing
and he visited mark once a week in prison ,
so , close ?
he probably participated in the crime .
and our killing duo found out about it .
that would explain the change in m.o ..
maybe mark gave a dying declaration and gave up his boys .
maybe our ladies are improvising ,
which explains killing paul outside his job .
we need to get to jason &apos;s house before they do .
today &apos;s your lucky day , jason .
who are you ?
kelly &apos;s mom .
you remember kelly , don &apos;t you ?
oh--i can explain . i can explain .
too late .
i &apos;ll do anything you want . ok ?
i could take you to her body .
her body ?
you know where my baby is ?
yeah , yeah . i can take you there .
if i do that , you &apos;ll let me go , right ?
clear .
guys , there &apos;s broken glass over here .
and blood on the floor .
morgan ! jj ! search the bedrooms .
blake , check outside ,
see if jason was dragged .
i am serious . i am not--
i &apos;m not the same guy that i used to be .
shut up !
i think about what i did to her every day .
which way ?
i--right .
i--i--i have a girlfriend now ,
and i have a good job .
i &apos;ve changed .
change is crap .
ok ? people just become more of who they are .
you don &apos;t know me .
tell me what you did to my daughter that day .
darlene ...
where did you take her ?
don &apos;t answer that .
i have the right to know .
it &apos;s complicated .
she was 8 years old .
you tell me what you did to her !
he was into improving himself .
&quot; let &apos;s do healthy relationships . &quot;
go figure .
guy seems in love .
ok .
uh ... it was , uh ...
it was hot that day .
we were all just sitting around getting high ,
and then out of the blue ,
mark asked if , uh ,
if any one of us had ever been with a ...
with a little girl .
i mean , of course we said--we said no ,
but then someone said ...
that we should go and get one .
and the next thing we know , we were out on the corner .
we &apos;re waiting and ...
i--i--
we were just about to leave ...
when your daughter walked by .
and so you thought , we &apos;ll just snatch this little black girl .
hey . it had nothing to do with race .
my best friend is black .
it &apos;s just ...
oh , kelly , she was just--she was so pretty . oh--
that &apos;s enough !
oh , we just lit up . oh ....
mommy should have been on time .
son of a bitch !
come on . what are you doing ?
oh , you think this is funny ?
i have been dying to tell that story for so long .
stop it ! stop it !
are you serious ?
i need to find her .
i need to bring her back home .
she is dead !
and we are killing this guy .
no , i can &apos;t ! i have got to bring her back home .
ellen , closure is important to a mom .
and , uh ...
besides , to protect myself , i told a neighbor
to write down the license plate of any strange car that came by .
so ...
you were expecting us ?
well , i knew you found the first two .
i assumed i &apos;d be next .
why are men so messy ?
i don &apos;t get down like this . i &apos;m a clean freak .
why does that not surprise me ?
something &apos;s just ... off about this guy .
gut feeling ?
deep gut .
jennifer jareau , your gut knows what it &apos;s talking about .
so nothing about jason nelson seems out of the ordinary ?
he seems as all @-@ american as apple pie .
no reports of any bodies found .
maybe they haven &apos;t killed him yet .
we &apos;ll keep you posted .
this guy might give these ladies a run for their money .
trophies .
kelly wasn &apos;t the only girl .
this is all a facade . jason &apos;s a psychopath .
a psychopath versus two vigilantes .
i have a feeling this is not going to end well .
is this it ?
is this where you put kelly ?
no .
what do you mean ?
you said this was where she is .
well , i will take you there if you do something for me .
no ! this is not a negotiation .
no . it &apos;s a bribe .
what do you want ?
kill someone .
anyone .
and then i &apos;ll tell you where it is .
you want us to just kill some random person ?
that &apos;s what i said .
i want you to know how good i felt .
that &apos;s disgusting !
we &apos;re not murderers .
oh , really ?
that &apos;s not what it looks like from me here .
and besides , if you don &apos;t do it ,
my neighbor will drop a dime on you , remember ?
you didn &apos;t tell your neighbor .
you &apos;ll never know .
darlene , do you want to find your daughter or not ?
not like this .
you don &apos;t have a choice , ladies .
yeah , we do !
darlene , just do it .
i can &apos;t !
damn it !
no . no !
awesome !
oh , no , no , no !
now you take us to her daughter .
now .
or you &apos;re next .
the victim says he was shot by a white woman .
she was with a black woman and a white guy .
these women have been so specific about their victims
up until this point , why shoot a random person ?
jason &apos;s a psychopath . maybe he made them do it .
he could be holding them hostage .
or he &apos;s got something that &apos;s keeping him alive .
a bargaining chip ?
maybe he knows where kelly &apos;s body &apos;s buried .
but ellen did the shooting , not darlene .
ellen tortured the second victim .
and she &apos;s helping darlene kill the rest of kelly &apos;s assailants ,
when she could have just walked away .
so this woman is a psychopath , too .
then jason &apos;s made a love connection .
and he &apos;ll probably try to manipulate ellen to do something worse .
we lost these women a long time ago .
blake , turn jason &apos;s place upside down .
we need to find where they may have put kelly &apos;s body .
ellen , why ? !
now , why did you go and do that ? !
we have come too far .
bull . she liked it .
no , she didn &apos;t .
tell him you didn &apos;t like that .
oh , oh , you know ,
if we were smart , ellen ,
we &apos;d partner up .
shut up !
we could drive across the country
just killing people .
i &apos;d get my little girls ,
and you can get , you know , whoever you wanted .
that &apos;s enough !
wouldn &apos;t it be great to live in a world where no one judged you ?
i wouldn &apos;t judge you , baby . i would have your back .
come on .
come on , what do you say ?
if we are not at that body in the next 20 minutes ,
i &apos;m gonna take that gun and shove it so far down your throat .
you &apos;re gonna wish you were dead .
yeah , yeah ...
just make a left .
this is getting exciting .
let &apos;s see .
i think it was over here to the right .
you think or you know ?
i know . i just moved it .
why would you do that ?
when mark died , i needed to cover my tracks .
it &apos;s right here . i remember .
right ... here .
start digging .
the landlord says this is jason &apos;s storage closet .
it looks like my storage unit .
my husband has so much crap , it &apos;s not funny .
is it hard being in a relationship with someone overseas ?
we make it work .
working for doctors without borders is a very noble cause .
i would imagine
you guys have an epistolary novel by now , though .
we stick to skype . it &apos;s modern .
when we &apos;re together , it &apos;s like we &apos;re dating ,
and when we &apos;re not , i get stuff done .
look at this .
fresh loam soil .
usually found near plains and streams .
either he was just camping ...
or used it to move the body .
jason finds out his friends are killed ,
he might take precautions .
what is taking so long ?
i &apos;m almost there .
hurry up !
there it is .
that &apos;s just a skull .
where &apos;s the rest of my daughter ?
we have a few more holes to dig .
you cut up my baby ?
that was my idea , too .
oh , my god !
oh , my god ! oh , my god !
there &apos;s loam soil surrounding some southern california beaches
and also loam soil around some parks in the area .
what areas are near running trails ?
uh , there is a trail in the hollywood hills area
that is lousy with loam soil .
and i &apos;m sending morgan and rossi to the location now .
over here .
they got him .
we &apos;ve got officers at ellen and darlene &apos;s homes
just in case they come back .
and have them check the airports ,
bus stations , train stations , everything .
i &apos;ll also put an apb out along the coast .
garcia cross @-@ checked the trophies we found at jason &apos;s ,
and they match articles from 3 different missing children .
and have officers excavate the area around where jason &apos;s body was found .
there may be more bodies there .
i &apos;m on it .
at least we got jason .
he could have kept killing forever .
and the women just get away .
for now .
you ok ?
yeah .
yeah .
so now what ?
we &apos;re gonna split up .
i might keep heading south .
you &apos;d do good here .
yeah . you &apos;re right .
i think it &apos;s better if we don &apos;t stay together .
you know what i don &apos;t get ?
how this was so easy for you .
how so ?
we had to kill 5 people .
our deal was just for two .
that &apos;s not what i &apos;m talking about .
does it bother you that none of this took the hurt away ?
i never thought it would .
then why did we do it ?
because somebody has to pay , ok ?
i don &apos;t care what anybody says .
actions have consequences .
maybe not at trial .
maybe not in jail .
come on . admit it , darlene ,
this gave you a reason to live .
that &apos;s what i was hoping .
but it just made me feel more ...
more nothing .
then you &apos;re a wuss .
i &apos;m gonna go get us something cold to drink .
wait . i diss you and you care if i &apos;m thirsty ?
you gotta start thinking about yourself , honey .
that &apos;s the game .
dollars ok ?
gracias .
ellen russel ?
how &apos;d you find me ?
darlene never unpacked her daughter &apos;s bags from this trip .
and i took a wild guess .
so what happens now ?
what happens now is you go back to the u.s.
i take 6 days off that i don &apos;t even want .
where &apos;s darlene ?
she &apos;s long gone .
personally , i have mixed feelings about that one .
but we &apos;ll get her , too .
levantese .
thanks for your help .
paul brown once said ,
&quot; if you win , say nothing .
