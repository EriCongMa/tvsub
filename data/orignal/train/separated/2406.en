My name is Elena Gilbert.
I'm a new vampire, and there have been complications.
I know that I'm sired to you, Damon.
You know what would make me happy?
That what you actually felt for me was real.
But there's hope now. There's a cure.
This cure has ruined us,
and it hasn't even been found yet.
What do you know about Silas?
He's the world's first immortal being,
who just happens to be the person with the cure.
Unlikely alliances have formed.
What the hell are you doing here?
How can I help?
No feelings. No attachment.
And someone will stop at nothing
to make sure we never find the cure.
You're going to find Jeremy Gilbert,
and you're going to kill him.
Kol compelled Damon to kill you.
You're gonna kill Kol instead.
Leaving so soon.
It's my place, Nik.
I don't appreciate you invading my privacy
like some kind of creeping Tom.
I apologize for breaking up
this sordid little tryst,
but I do have some urgent business.
Or have you forgotten that our paranoid brother Kol
is running around with a white oak stake
and homicide on the brain?
He tried to kill me last night. I didn't forget.
Yes. Unfortunately,
he seems to have absconded with my set of daggers.
Poor Nik. However will you get your way
without your precious daggers?
They were so handy when you wanted to end a conversation
with one of us.
Kol's irrational fear of Silas
has pushed him off the edge.
We need to put him down before he does any more damage.
Now, I know you have the last dagger,
and I know you have some white ash, so hand it over.
And leave myself unprotected?
You can file that request under "No chance in hell."
Be gone by the time I've showered.
Lurkers aren't welcome here.
I need that dagger, Stefan.
Talk some sense into her.
Why don't you talk some sense into her?
I'm headed home to play prison guard to Damon.
He's on lockdown ever since Kol compelled him
to kill Jeremy last night.
You see? That's my point exactly.
If you let Kol run free,
then Jeremy won't live to see his junior prom,
and we can kiss our map to the cure good-bye.
But if you help me dagger Kol,
Damon will be uncompelled,
Jeremy will live,
and we'll all be on our merry way
to a human Elena.
Where are you?
I told Caroline I'd take her place
at decade dance prep, but none of the rest of you showed.
I know. I'm sorry. I had to, though.
I've got Jeremy under house arrest
because Kol wants to kill him.
And Klaus wants to take him
on some vampire-slaying road trip.
And since neither of them were invited in,
it's the only place that I can keep him safe.
Why does it sound like you're under fire?
Apparently I'm living in a fraternity house now.
I'm training.
Me, too.
Train yourself to do some dishes.
And put these weapons away
before someone tries to use one on me.
It's hard for me to look forward to this dance
while you're trapped in your house.
Listen, I have a plan to put an end to all of this.
I want Jeremy to kill Kol.
You want him to kill an original?
Think about it.
Kol's sire line must stretch to the moon by now.
If Jeremy kills Kol,
every vampire that he's ever turned,
not to mention everyone that they've turned, will die,
which means the hunter's mark will be complete,
And we'll have our key to finding the cure.
I'm on my way. We'll figure it out.
Do you think caroline will notice
if there's only 89 red balloons?
Actually, probably yes.
Elena.
Sorry.
What happened?
I don't know.
There's something in the water.
Are you serious?
You dumped vervain into the water supply?
Where did you even get it?
I have my sources.
I'm also reinstating the curfew
and canceling all town events.
Dad, there's the dance tonight.
Not anymore.
Are you serious?
Honey, I'm trying to protect you, not punish you.
The well-being of this town is my job now.
No. Dad, it's mine, and I've been doing fine
without you getting involved.
You've been doing fine?
Would you like me to read you
all the names of the people that have gone missing
or died in tragic accidents in your senior year alone?
Head straight home, please. We're having a family meeting.
No one can get to the cure
if you're too dead to find it.
You've come to snap my neck again?
Because I woke up feeling completely unmurderous,
and I'm pretty sure that it's safe to set me free.
Oh man, really?
You practically bled me dry.
At least spring for a bag or something.
I'm thirsty.
Exactaly what I had in mind.
Hello, mate.
What the hell are you doing here?
Babysitting.
Give him a vial of blood every couple of hours
so he doesn't desiccate.
If he gets too much strength back
or if he just annoys you,
bleed him out again.
Silent treatment, huh?
Is that your best shot?
He's still pissed at me for sleeping with Elena.
Are you sure about that?
Because I caught him trying to sneak out
of Rebekah's bed this morning,
which would suggest to me that he's moved on.
Well, well. Looks like my brother
ripped out a page of my revenge sex handbook.
Well, why don't you two enjoy your little, uh,
villain bonding time?
I'll let you know when I get the dagger from Rebekah.
Damon is fine.
I locked him with all the creature comforts he deserves.
That's not why I called.
Kol just tried to kill Bonnie.
What? Is she ok?
Yeah, just shaken up.
She managed to hold him off, but kol seems pretty intent
on murdering anyone who's looking for that cure.
Yeah. Klaus has me trying to convince Rebekah
to give up her dagger so we can take care of Kol.
I don't want to just dagger Kol.
I want Jeremy to kill him.
What did you just say?
Bonnie says she's got all this crazy new power.
She thinks she can hold him long enough
for Jeremy to get a clean shot.
And then what, huh?
Klaus and Rebekah will kill every single one of us
out of spite.
They may be dysfunctional, bickering lunatics,
but they stick together no matter what.
That's why you need to find the dagger
and use it on Rebekah.
She can't come looking for revenge if she's lying in a box.
Yeah, I can't do that.
I know you can't because vampires can't use the dagger,
but Matt can.
It's not like she doesn't deserve it.
And bonnie thinks that she can get Klaus out of the picture, too,
At least temporarily.
Once we get this cure, none of this will matter
because we can use it against them.
All right, fine, but how do you plan to lure Kol in?
Jeremy Gilbert.
Nice to see I'm still on your speed dial, mate.
Hey, you want to meet up at the batting cages in Denver?
Actually, it's Elena Gilbert.
What a treat.
Yeah, I was just thinking of all the clever ways
I could have your brother killed,
but I'd settle for ripping off
his illustrated arm instead.
I need to talk to you--in person.
I want to call a truce in the name of Silas.
You want to talk about silas?
I'll meet you wherever you want.
I'll come to you.
I'll tell you what.
How about I come to you?
If you want to truce,
open the door and invite me in.
I'm waiting.
Let me in, and let's talk truce.
Wouldn't it be kind of stupid to invite you in?
On the contrary.
I can't kill your brother with my own two hands,
or I'll suffer the hunter's curse
and spend the next 20 years trying to off myself in gruesome ways.
And I heard that vervain is back in town
so I can't compel you to kill him either.
So I think it's fair to say
you're semi-safe, for now.
I'm the only one that could invite him inside.
He's right, obviously.
You'd think being alive for over 1,000 years
would teach me some manners,
but I couldn't resist stopping by.
If I let you in, my brother goes.
You're not getting near him.
Fair enough.
You can come in.
No gold medal in bravery, I see.
Another thing I love about the modern age is
music anytime you like.
So, it's the part you offer me a drink
so we can have a proper chat.
Colours are fabric, the eighties were just tragic.
You know, I think shoulder pads
rival 17th-century Puritan smocks for crimes against fashion.
Looking for something to wear to the dance?
Aye. Are you asking me to a date?
Actually, it was canceled.
So why are you here?
Back for more dagger talk?
Somebody has some trust issues.
It's called a healthy skepticism.
I know you were trying to sneak out this morning.
I'm not stupid.
Sorry.
I'm still trying to get used to this.
Do you regret it?
No.
Do you want it to happen again?
Maybe.
Even if I don't give you the dagger?
You think that I would sleep with you
just to get the dagger?
Don't give me that innocent look.
You've done plenty to me
in the name of getting what you want.
Well, I guess I should pack up these racks.
Just another failed attempt at getting to a high-school dance.
Why do you care so much about high-school dance?
I don't. I was just bored.
Right.
We can also go, if you want.
Not if it's canceled, we can't.
Since when do you care about the rules?
You know, none of this would be an issue
if you'd have just done your job properly.
I was perfectly willing to let you train Jeremy.
No, you weren't. Are you kidding?
You got there on day two.
Do you know how hard it is to get
these x-box brains to focus?
And then when I turned a room full of barflies
into vampires for him to slaughter,
you let Kol kill them.
Your brother problem, not mine, buddy.
And whose bright idea was it
to saddle Jeremy with a conscience, hmm?
Well, we couldn't have him trying to stake Elena
in her sleep, now, could we?
Ah, yes, for the love of Elena.
How is it that she manages to overlook
every horrific thing you've ever done?
Is it willful ignorance
or perhaps something more pathological?
Some people are just more capable
of forgiveness than others.
Bet you score about a negative 500 in that realm.
Come on. There must be a secret.
It can't just be the sire bond. What is it?
Compulsion?
Manipulation?
What did you say to her?
I think this has something to do
with a certain blond vampire.
I think you murdered Carol Lockwood,
and I think you're worried
that Caroline's never going to forgive you.
You've done worse.
Debatable. See, I don't mind being the bad guy,
because somebody has to fill that role and get things done.
You do bad things for no reason.
You do them to be a dick.
Debatable.
If you're gonna be bad, be bad with purpose.
Otherwise you're just not worth forgiving.
Sorry, and dig up your people's alcohol.
Yeah, that's the problem with people today.
They have no drinking imagination.
Turn of the century New Orleans,
now, they knew how to make a drink.
You lived in New Orleans?
We all did,
till Niklaus shoved a dagger in my heart.
Why? What did you do?
What makes you think I did anything?
Has your alliance with my brother
softened you to his horrors?
I don't have an alliance with Klaus.
We had a mutual interest in finding the cure. That's all.
Had?
Yes.
And I'm willing to give up looking for it
if you promise to leave my brother alone.
Now can you teach me how to make this?
Ok, I'll get some ice.
杰里米:设法找她 拖住科尔
Bonnie, where are you? I've called, like, 17 times.
Kol is in our house. We need you.
Ok, I'm headed to your house now.
Here you go.
Would you like one?
Sure. Why not?
You are really good at that game.
Especially considering you've been locked up in a coffin
for a hundred years.
I'm a quick learner. Speedy reflexes.
It's not much like the real thing, though, is it?
You have killed, haven't you?
Or are you one of those mary sue vampires?
I killed once.
I'm guessing your number is a lot higher than mine.
You lose track over the years.
So are we going to talk about Silas
or just jibber jabber?
No one else seems to think Silas exists.
So why do you?
I used to run with some witches
in Africa in the 14th century,
Haiti in the 17th century,
New Orleans in the 1900s.
They all knew about Silas
and that he needed to stay buried.
I actually hold witches in high esteem.
Yeah, but why Silas?
Why are you so afraid of him?
They said if Silas rises,
he'll unleash hell on earth.
I happen to like earth just the way it is.
That's pretty Biblical.
Well, that's the other problem with people today.
They've lost faith,
and in that loss, they no longer know who they should fear.
I have to get to Elena.
Have you seen my phone?
I've got your phone, and I've got your car keys.
And I told you we are having a family meeting.
Is that something you read in a book?
Because we have never had a family meeting.
I've let this go on long enough.
Shane said you and your magic are like a ticking time bomb.
And I told you he's crazy.
I lost your mother to witchcraft.
I don't intend to lose you.
It's not your life. It's mine.
Hey, is Bonnie here?
She's busy.
It's important.
What's going on?
I've called you, like, a hundred times.
Kol is in our house.
I have to go.
I said no.
Stop telling me what to do!
No one's going anywhere!
Mom?
Abby, please come in.
What are you doing here?
Your father called. Who's professor Shane?
What has he been teaching you?
Bonnie, we don't have time for this.
This is a family matter.
My sister's in trouble. We need Bonnie's help.
My daughter is done helping Elena Gilbert.
Now get out.
Mom!
Answer my question.
What lies has this professor been telling you?
Don't! Jeremy! Hey, stop!
Stop.
Don't hurt her. She's my mom.
Look at me.
Just go, Okay?
I'm right behind you.
You wanna talk?
Let's talk.
But I think this is a good year.
What if I said I don't believe you?
Ok, you got me. I don't know anything about wine.
Just seems odd that you being so willing
to give up something you want so much.
I would do anything for my brother.
And if what you're saying about Silas is true.
What does it matter what I want
if it puts everyone else in danger?
Well, this has been a lightning.
Thanks for the drinks.
I'll take your request for truth under advisement.
Is there any chance that you can be wrong about silas?
Trust me, Elena.
Some things are better left buried.
Think I saw a horro movie that started just like this.
Did you know they play movies on tv all night long now?
Hundreds of them.
So much better than those silly
Black-and-white picture shows we use to go to.
I don't know.
Kind of miss the old ones.
You got any requests for the DJ?
I'll let you pick. Nothing cheesy.
Oh, that leaves out about half the decade.
Hope you like the cure.
Funny.
So is everything about the eighties so...
excessive?
It had its charm.
"Say anything"--
Lloyd Dobler standing outside of a bedroom window
with a boombox over his head
desperately trying to get back the girl of his dreams.
"Princess bride"--
Wesley slays giant rats for love.
"Breakfast club"-- one detention
turns a bunch of outcasts into allies.
So it was a decade of sentimental drivel, as well.
Well, I was gonna say love, friendship,
Possibility of anything happening.
You would've loved it.
And why is that?
Because, as much as we both hate to admit it,
we care about those things.
That better not be a corsage.
I loathe corsages.
These were all the rage in the eighties.
Let's dance.
I'm sorry. He left.
I mean, I tried to stall as long as I could.
That's Bonnie. She was right behind me.
I've considered your request for truce.
Request denied.
I'm sorry. I've already been invited in.
Hide and seek?
Fine by me.
Dad needs to mind his own business,
he had no right to call you here.
It's not just your father, Bonnie.
Witches talk. Word gets around.
I found a new way to practice.
It's unconventional, but I can handle myself, I promise.
That's not what Shane said.
Shane is sitting in a jail cell right now.
You're gonna take his word over mine?
I've warned you about dark magic before.
It's not dark magic. It's expression, and I need it.
They found a cure, Mom.
There's a cure for vampirism,
and I can do the spell to access it.
I can save you, but I have to go...
Now.
I'm not the one that needs to be saved.
You are.
Your brother's lack of communication is infuriating.
It's one of his trademarks,
like his brooding and his hair.
I don't understand what's taking so long.
I mean, how hard is it to steal a dagger?
From the vampire who's been stabbed by it as many times as your sister,
I'd say difficult.
Sweet.
You disappoint me, Damon.
You're not trying very hard to get out of here.
I expected more the daring escape artist,
less the cell potato.
Well, I am compelled to kill Jeremy,
so I figured it's probably smarter
to sit in there and chitchat with you
than try to bust out of here like the Hulk.
How do you think Elena felt about that, by the way,
Your inability to overcome Kol's compulsion for a single moment,
even though it meant killing the person
she loves the most in the world?
She's met me.
She knows impulse control is not my strong suit.
Still, must be hard
trying to live up to Stefan.
I remember when I compelled him to feed on Elena,
he fought so hard, he actually managed to resist.
Now, that's love.
What do you know about love?
I know that you're in love with Elena,
but I think you're afraid of what might happen
when we find the cure at the end of the rainbow.
Personally, I don't see a fairy-tale ending for you?
All I see is Stefan and Elena.
I think you see the same thing.
Well, if it isn't the happy homicidal maniac.
Do you know that your darling former blood bag
and her brother are trying to kill me?
What?
Don't pretend like you're not in on it.
Your obsession to find the cure
clearly trumps any sibling loyalty you once felt.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I'm going to rip off Jeremy's arm
and kill Elena just for sport.
Then I'm coming for you.
What the hell is going on?
I don't know.
What are Stefan and Elena planning?
I don't know.
I've been stuck in the penalty box with you since yesterday.
Stefan won't talk to me,
And Elena won't come to see me.
So maybe you're right. Maybe she's written me off.
Tell me what you know.
I don't know anything about a plan.
You stay here till I return.
I will stay here until you return...
or not.
It's amazing which you can find stashed away in the teachers' lounge.
This song is not as terrible as the other ones.
This song is the Godfather of rock anthems, ok?
What's going on with you?
You're... fun tonight.
I can't listen to this music
without thinking of my best friend Lexi.
We spent most of the eighties together.
I remember this one time she snuck us backstage
and compelled half the band to do tequila shots
with us before the show.
She was fearless, kind of like you.
So you slept with her, too?
No. It wasn't like that.
I was just a better person when I was with her.
I didn't think I'd ever feel that way again.
Until Elena.
Until Elena.
And now that's over.
That look right there,
that is why I don't let myself care.
Well, you can say that,
But we both know it's not true.
Don't worry.
I'll protect you if Kol tracks his way
to this abandoned dance.
I think I'll choose next song.
No. You know what? I've a better idea.
That way.
Will you coming?
Missed.
Go!
Now, About that arm.
Like that!
This is ridiculous.
Well, that's the whole point of the "Breakfast club" slide.
It's supposed to be ridiculous.
No. That's--
That's cheating.
What is fun about hurtling down a hallway
like a teenage imbecile?
You're just gonna have to do it to find out.
All right. It's the shoes.
Take off your shoes, you'll be fine, ok?
This is what you want right?
Go ahead.
Take care.
You're right, I do care.
I want stupid koala corsages
and a prom.
I want to have kids with someone
who loves me enough to stand
outside my window with a stupid boombox.
I want to be human.
So let Klaus put down my brother.
Let's go find the cure.
Come on, let's go.
You dragged her?
Just enough to keep her down
until I can get some witches here
to clean her mind from that poison
that professor has been teaching her.
That's not happening.
Bonnie, please.
I don't belong to the spirits anymore.
I belong to myself. Sorry.
Now, like I said, I don't fancy the hunter's curse.
So I'm just gonna chop off your arm, but don't worry.
I'll heal you right up with a bit of blood after.
Sorry about the sting.
Now, which arm is it? Is it left or right?
I'll just chop off both to be safe.
Jeremy! Now!
What did you do?
We didn't have a choice.
He was trying to cut off Jeremy's arm.
Lies.
He never would've gotten
inside if you hadn't have set a trap for him.
You said you were gonna put him down, too.
I was gonna make him suffer on my terms!
I want to burn this house to the ground,
and then when you try to flee for our lives,
I'll kill you both without blinking.
You kill us, you'll never get to the cure.
You'll never be able to make any more hybrids.
You really think I care for an instant about my bloody hybrids?
I want the cure so I can destroy it.
I would've killed you all the second we dug it up,
but now I'm just gonna watch you burn instead.
Invite him in.
Do it.
Come in.
Living room. Go.
Witch, you can't do this to me.
You have no idea what I can do now.
I will hunt all of you to your end!
Do you hear me? Do you?
I don't believe you.
Kol is not dead. He can't be.
Listen, Rebekah. They didn't have a choice.
Kol started this when he went after Jeremy.
He went after you, too. Do you remember?
I mean, he was never gonna let us find the cure.
So you knew.
This whole night, you knew.
I'm not gonna let the people that I care about get hurt.
Not Jeremy, not Elena, not even Damon.
And you can hate me for it.
Now he can't hurt you, either.
And I want us to find this cure together,
you and me.
Not just for Elena, but for you.
So you can have what you want.
You can be who you want.
You can be human again.
Everyone deserves a second chance right?
Why would I trust you?
I don't know.
I guess I could give you my word,
but at the end of the day you'll just have to take a leap.
Didn't work.
It took time for Finn's line to die off.
Remember? It'll work.
What if it doesn't?
Where's that Gilbert optimism?
Sorry I missed all the excitment.
I'm just happy to see you.
So I guess I didn't miss much.
Got the Silas's headstone.
We're just waiting for Jeremy's mark to grow.
Klaus is trapped in our living room.
Temporarily.
I drawn the new moon to bond the spell.
Got three days to find that cure, four max.
If we don't, we might as well look up Katherine's appearance
and see if she wants some company in hiding,
'cuz he will come after us.
We'll find it.
Now we've got Rebekah taken care of,
all we need is Professor Shane,
we'll get everything we need.
Yeah, I didn't uh...I didn't dagger her.
What? Why not?
I didn't need to, she's on our side.
On our side?
Did you really just say that?
Yeah. She handed over the headstone,
I mean she wants to find this cure more than anyone of us.
Why would you possibly think that you could trust her?
Let me guess. She pledged her allegiance
to you while you were naked in the sack.
I bet you're just dying to get that out, aren't you Damon?
Oh was this supposed to be secret?
Maybe you should make that a little clearer
while you're bleeding me dry in our cellar.
That is keeping you from killing Jeremy.
Stop it, both of you.
Now why don't you tell her to calm down, Damon?
You've managed she is all sire bond pretty well so far, haven't you?
It's happening.
My God.
What? You can see it?
