it was pretty cool .
so are you saying that you would like me ...
... to dress up like princess leia in a gold bikini ?
okay
princess leia and the gold bikini ? every guy our age loved that .
really ?
it &apos;s huge ! that &apos;s the moment when she stopped being a princess ...
... and she became , like , you know , a woman .
did you ever do the leia thing ?
really ? that great , huh ?
no , it &apos;s just that i got this new pager , and i have it on &quot; vibrate . &quot;

hi , you guys !
look who i found standing outside the szechuan dragon ...
... staring at a parking meter .
why aren &apos;t you at work ?

we always go together . we &apos;re like the three hockey @-@ teers , you know ?
i may be way out on a limb here , but do you have a problem with janice ?
no !
yes ....
oh , god , how do i say this ?
you know that girl from the restaurant with the hair ?
that girl that i hate ? she drives me crazy .
look , i don &apos;t hate janice . she &apos;s just a lot to take , you know ?
well , there you go .
don &apos;t look at me like that .
she drove you nuts before , remember ?
i &apos;m crazy about her now . this could be the real thing .
capital r , capital t !
don &apos;t worry , those are the right letters .
look , what do you want me to say ?
i want you to say that you like her ! i can &apos;t
like her ! -no .
so you &apos;re not even gonna try ?
what &apos;s the point ? lt &apos;s like this chemical thing , you know ?
every time she starts laughing , i just wanna ...
... pull my arm off so i have something to throw at her .
thanks for trying .
oh , and by the way , there is no count rushmore !
then who &apos;s the guy that painted the faces on the mountain ?
how could you tell her ?
i didn &apos;t think it would be that big a deal !
she didn &apos;t think it would be that big a deal !
who are you talking to when you do that ?
look , that was supposed to be a private , personal thing between us .
phoebe is my girlfriend , okay ? we tell each other everything .
guys do the same thing .
i mean , what about all that locker @-@ room stuff ?
that &apos;s different . that &apos;s like , who dated a stripper ?
or who did it on the back of the staten lsland ferry ?
both of those joey ?
but you don &apos;t talk about your girlfriend ...
... and the intimate stuff you do with her .
not even with your best friend ?
that is so sad .
you &apos;re missing out on so much .
i mean , the bonding and the sharing ...
... and knowing they &apos;re going through the same thing you are .
so , what , you tell each other everything ?
pretty much .
did you talk about the night of five times ?
do you tell people about the night of five times ?
honey , that was with carol .
i know , but it &apos;s still worth mentioning , i think .
relax every muscle in your body .
listen to the plinky @-@ plunky music .
okay , now close your eyes ...
... and think of a happy place .
tell me your happy place .
richard &apos;s living room , drinking wine .
no , no , no . not a richard thing . just put down the glass and get out .
i &apos;m sorry , but that &apos;s my happy place .
okay , fine . use my happy place . just don &apos;t move anything in there .
i &apos;ll try not to .
okay . all right , so , you &apos;re in a meadow ...
... millions of stars in the sky
you think breaking up was a mistake ?
there are no questions in the happy place .
just the warm breeze and the moonlight flowing through the trees .
i &apos;ll bet he &apos;s over me . i &apos;ll bet he &apos;s fine .
betting and wagering of any kind are not permitted in the happy place .
there &apos;s just , you know , the lovely waterfalls ...
... and the trickling fountains ...
... and the calming sounds of the babbling brook .
okay , this isn &apos;t working .
i &apos;m still awake , and now i have to pee .
guess who !
janice . hi . you just missed chandler ...
but won &apos;t you come in before you go ?
so i hear ...
... you hate me !
i never said hate . i was very careful about that .
a little birdie told me you wanted to rip your arm off and throw it at me .
and you got &quot; hate &quot; from that ? you &apos;re taking a big leap there .
all right , fine , fine , fine !
we have got to do something about our little situation here .
so this is my idea .
you and me spending some quality time together .
but what does that
for chandler !
okay . i &apos;m in .
okay ! this is what we &apos;ll call it : joey and janice &apos;s day of fun !
a whole day ?
yes , because that &apos;s how long it takes to love me .
yeah , i know . i sleep in the next room .
so do you guys all hate janice too ?
you hate janice now ? joey &apos;s gonna be so relieved .
oh , my god .
oh , my god .
well , look , everybody. lt &apos;s weepy :
the mime that cares too much .
so i went down to the post office ...
... and it turns out it was those videos that i ordered ...
... for richard about the civil war .
he loved the civil war .
do you want us to take you home ?
or maybe to a galaxy far , far away .
women tell each other everything ! did you know that ?
no , chandler , everything .
like stuff you like . stuff she likes .
technique . stamina . girth .
girth ?
why ? why ? why ?
why would they do this ?
rachel says sharing &apos;s great and supposedly ...
... we ought to be doing it .
do you want to ?
we &apos;re not gonna talk about girth , are we ?
all right , you go first .
okay . okay , i &apos;ll go first .
so the other night ...
... rachel and i are in bed talking about fantasies ...
... and i happened to describe a particular ...
... star wars thing
princess leia and the gold bikini .
i know !
well , that was easy .
okay , you go .
okay , you know when you &apos;re in bed with a woman ...
... fooling around ...
... and you get all these mental images in your brain ?
like elle macpherson or the girl at the xerox place ?
with the bellybutton ring ?
i know .
and then all of a sudden , your mom pops into your head .
and you &apos;re , like , &quot; mom , get out of here ! &quot;
but after that , you can &apos;t think of anything else .
and you can &apos;t stop what you &apos;re doing . so it &apos;s kind of like you &apos;re ...
... you know ...
... you know ....
you don &apos;t know !
your mom ?
you &apos;re telling me about your mom ? what &apos;s the matter with you ?
you said
i said &quot; share , &quot; not &quot; scare &quot; !
go sit over there !
we &apos;re back !
what are you guys doing together ?
joey and janice &apos;s day of fun !
really ?
we went to a mets game . we got chinese food .
and , you know , i love this woman .
you have got competition , buddy .
well , i just came by to give you a kiss .
i have to go pick up the baby . so , i &apos;ll see you later , sweetheart .
you too , chandler .
you still can &apos;t stand her , can you ?
i &apos;m sorry , i tried ! i really did !
i appreciate you giving it a shot .
but you know , the good thing ...
... is that we spent the whole day together and i survived .
and what &apos;s even more amazing , so did she .
it was bat day at shea stadium .
i guess that &apos;s something .
oh , man , that &apos;s huge !
now i know i can stand to be around her . which means ...
... i get to hang out with you .
which is kind of the whole point anyway .
oh , hey ! we stopped by the coffee shop and ran into ross .
oh , god .
if it makes you feel any better , i do it too .
really ?
oh , yeah !
i always picture your mom when i &apos;m having sex .
april 12,1861 .
the united states garrison at fort sumter was fired upon .
it is now under bombardment by
dad ! what are you doing ?
it &apos;s your mother &apos;s bridge night , so l came into the city for a moni @-@ cuddle .
since when did you start smoking cigars ?
i don &apos;t . i just like the smell of them .
so what are you really doing here ?
i just wanted to make sure you &apos;re okay .
why wouldn &apos;t i be okay ?
i saw richard .
so how you doing ?
i &apos;m fine .
i &apos;m just a little tired , but i &apos;m okay .
how &apos;s richard doing ?
you don &apos;t want to know .
no , i really , really do .
well , he &apos;s doing terrible !
really ?
worse than when he broke up with barbara .
you &apos;re not just saying that , are you ?
no , the man is a mess !
was he crying ?
do you think he was waiting till after you left , so he could cry ?
maybe .
i think so .
honey , relationships are hard . like with your mom and me .
you know , after we graduated from college , we broke up for a while .
it seems her father , your grandfather ...
... wanted her to travel around europe like he did .
of course , he got to do it on uncle sam &apos;s nickel ...
... because he was also strafing german troop trains at the time .
however ....
okay , here we go .
i am jabba &apos;s prisoner . and you ...
... have a really weird look on your face .
what ? honey , what is it ?
did i get the hair wrong ?
or what ? did you just picture it differently ? what ?
it &apos;s not you . it &apos;s ....
what is it ? come on , sweetie . you &apos;re , like , freaking me out here .
