hello .
i &apos;m looking for howard wolowitz .
may i ask what this is about ?
no , you may not .
very well .
hi , colonel williams , how can i help you ?
okay , sure , i can meet with you on thursday .
caltech is fine .
yeah , and may i ask what this is about ?
i may not ?
that &apos;s what he said to me .
look at this .
elon musk has a theory that we &apos;re all just characters
in some advanced civilization &apos;s video game .
so some alien kid spent his money
on the asthma @-@ and @-@ glasses upgrade for me ?
well , he doesn &apos;t say it &apos;s a good game .
all right , we got a problem .
what &apos;s up ?
the air force contacted me about our quantum gyroscope .
they want to have a meeting .
really ?
yeah . this military guy showed up at howard &apos;s door .
he was terrifying .
oh , what did he say ?
he gave me his business card
and asked me to please pass it along to howard .
that doesn &apos;t sound terrifying .
to a white guy born here , no .
if you are a brown guy whose name has a lot of syllables in it --
terrifying .
you realize if the military declares our research classified ,
they can take the whole thing away from us .
and if that happens ,
we &apos;ll never be able to sell it commercially .
there goes our big payday .
i was counting on that money--
i need to make as much as my wife
so i don &apos;t have to try so hard in bed .
you do that , too ?
oh , yeah . how do you think i stay this thin ?
gentlemen , i think we are losing sight of the real issue .
we are on the precipice of becoming faceless cogs
in the military @-@ industrial complex .
isn &apos;t that exciting ?
you &apos;re kidding , right ?
not at all . in star wars , when the stormtroopers
would march in perfect formation ,
harassing civilians , didn &apos;t you ever think ,
&quot; hey , that could be me &quot; ?
sheldon , we could be contributing
to a weapons system that oppresses mankind
for the next thousand years .
okay , howard &apos;s on board . what do you think , leonard ?
i &apos;m worried about howard .
ever since that guy from the air force showed up ,
he &apos;s been a nervous wreck .
all right , we work at a giant pharmaceutical company .
get him some anti @-@ anxiety meds .
he won &apos;t take any pills that aren &apos;t chewable
and shaped like a flintstone .
you know , when leonard &apos;s feeling anxious
i make him take a long walk .
does that help ?
well , for a while . then he comes back .
i don &apos;t believe this .
what &apos;s wrong ?
this guy from the office just congratulated me on being pregnant .
you did already know , right ?
no one at the office did .
did you tell anyone ?
no .
you told me not to .
i bet it was barbara chen in retrovirus .
she might have heard me throwing up one morning .
every since she got the hearing aid , she thinks she &apos;s so great .
why don &apos;t you want anyone to know ?
&apos;cause i &apos;m up for a major immunotherapy study ,
and if they find out i &apos;m pregnant
they might give it to someone else .
would they really do that ?
i know they would-- they did it to barbara chen last year
when i told everyone she was pregnant .
wait till i snapchat that my friends might be working
on a top secret government project .
are you crazy ?
you can &apos;t put that on snapchat .
fine , i &apos;ll put it on facebook like a caveman .
you know , maybe before our meeting we should talk to a lawyer .
that &apos;s not a bad idea .
well , you must have someone in your family that &apos;s a lawyer .
why ? because i &apos;m jewish ?
that &apos;s like me saying , &quot; hey , you &apos;re indian .
doesn &apos;t your cousin work in a call center ? &quot;
my cousin does work in a call center .
and my cousin &apos;s a lawyer .
we don &apos;t need howard &apos;s cousin , no .
we have me .
you &apos;re not a lawyer , sheldon , you &apos;re just a know @-@ it @-@ all .
i am not a know @-@ it @-@ all .
i &apos;m a person who knows lots of things
and likes to correct other people when they &apos;re wrong .
that &apos;s the definition of being a know @-@ it @-@ all .
or in german , a besserwisser .
how did you think you were gonna hide your pregnancy ?
i had a plan-- i kept leaving dove bar wrappers around
to explain any weight gain .
where did you get empty dove bar wrappers ?
from all the dove bars i ate ! i &apos;m pregnant !
try to keep up !
i &apos;m sorry . i @-@ i have to go find out if my boss knows .
well , whatever happens , we &apos;re here for you .
thanks . you guys are the best .
yeah , drive safe . we love you . and give us a call ...
oh , my god , it was me , it was me !
i &apos;m the one who blabbed she was pregnant !
what ? !
i didn &apos;t mean to .
it just slipped out in front of her assistant one day .
i ... i forgot my coat .
oh ! here &apos;s your coat , honey .
that &apos;s such a cute jacket .
god , i feel so bad-- i just lied to her .
oh , but you did it so well .
that &apos;s amazing !
it &apos;s like watching a sculptor ,
but your clay was lies .
is that really what &apos;s important right now ?
i mean , seriously , you have got to let me scan your brain
when you &apos;re being dishonest so i can see what lights up .
that &apos;s super helpful , amy .
thanks a lot . i can &apos;t wait to do that .
i can see a clump of bitch cells lightin &apos; up from here .
give me a second to call my cousin .
i don &apos;t see how a tax lawyer from fort lauderdale
could be helpful regarding intellectual property .
first of all , he &apos;s in boca raton ,
which is better than fort lauderdale .
but more importantly ,
he lasted two days on jeopardy ,
so he &apos;s clearly a smart guy .
hello .
hey , marty . thanks for talking to us .
hey , no problem .
thanks for going to outer space so no matter what i do
my mom will be disappointed in me .
well , i married a little catholic girl , so we &apos;re even .
anyway , this is leonard and sheldon .
the three of us came up with the guidance system .
hi .
hello .
and this is my friend , raj .
oh , i &apos;m not on the patent . i &apos;m just here
because there &apos;s a bumblebee in my office .
i saw it . it &apos;s big .
anyway , like i said in the e @-@ mail ,
this meeting &apos;s on thursday .
do you have any advice for us ?
well , i don &apos;t know much about patent law .
but , uh , my advice is :
hear them out , offer as little information as possible ,
and whatever you do , don &apos;t sign anything .
&quot; don &apos;t sign anything &quot; ? that &apos;s your advice ?
okay , so , uh , if during this meeting ,
one of us were to , say , complete an oil painting ,
you &apos;d recommend that we leave that unsigned ?
that &apos;s not what i meant .
that &apos;s what you said .
that &apos;s not what i meant .
this must be how you practice law in boca raton ,
by saying things you don &apos;t mean
and meaning things you don &apos;t say .
howard , why is he yelling at me ?
all right , you were on jeopardy .
allow me to alex trebek
this and put it in the form of a question :
who has been a complete waste of our time ?
marty , let me call you back .
someday , when i &apos;m up on murder charges ,
you &apos;ll be hearing from me .
you don &apos;t need him . i &apos;ll represent you .
hi .
hey . what brings you by ?
oh , had to go to a sales seminar on our new sleeping pill .
oh . how was it ?
great .
fell asleep ?
in , like , two minutes . yeah .
so , how is everything going around here ?
are you still upset about people finding out you &apos;re pregnant ?
i &apos;m furious .
sure , sure .
uh , did you ever figure out who told ?
no . i confronted barbara chen , but she claimed
she didn &apos;t know what i was talking about .
well , i guess it &apos;s just gonna remain a mystery ,
you know , like whatever happened in that seminar
after they dimmed the lights .
it had to be barbara .
i &apos;ve been trying to figure out a way to get back at her .
do you think using her work computer to google
&quot; how to be a prostitute &quot; is over the line ?
uh , you know , when i was in high school ,
there was this girl who was talking about me behind my back ,
so me and all my friends ,
we cornered her in the bathroom and forgave her .
what kind of revenge is that ?
this woman screwed with my job . she &apos;s got to pay .
okay , all right , honey , you know what ?
there was something i was too scared to tell you yesterday ,
a @-@ and now ... i &apos;m just balls @-@ out terrified to tell you , but ...
the truth is it ...
wasn &apos;t barbara chen , it was me .
i &apos;m the reason everyone knows .
why did you do that ?
well , it was an accident . i am so sorry i lied .
get out .
oh , you know , i also lied about the girl in the bathroom .
yeah , we actually dumped her retainer in the toilet
and put it back in her mouth .
i don &apos;t understand why i can &apos;t talk at this meeting .
&apos;cause when you talk , it enrages people .
okay .
quick question .
am i allowed to exchange pleasantries
upon meeting this colonel ?
yes .
am i allowed to inform him
that colonel sanders was never actually in the military ?
i &apos;m getting enraged .
fine .
can i use text @-@ to @-@ speech software ?
no !
don &apos;t speak .
aw , nuts .
gentlemen !
i &apos;m colonel williams .
thank you for meeting with me .
hi .
hello .
so , which one of you is the brains behind all this ?
it &apos;s a group effort ,
but i guess if we had to pick a main brain , it would be me .
and because of the quantum vortices ,
this can run perpetually ?
exactly .
yeah , you have a good grasp of the physics .
well , i &apos;m a scientist by training .
really ?
you &apos;re a physicist ?
better . i &apos;m an engineer .
where did you go to school ?
mit .
oh . well , hey , me , too .
i should have known .
behind every great invention is an mit mind .
i &apos;ll cut to the chase .
the air force believes there &apos;s an application for this technology ,
and we &apos;re interested in funding your research .
well , thanks , but you should know
we &apos;re a little concerned about this being used in weapons .
oh , well , let me put your mind at ease .
what we use it for is none of your business .
i don &apos;t know how i feel about this .
look , guys , it &apos;s just a guidance system .
it &apos;s not like you &apos;re handing us
the death star from star trek .
all you need to worry about is ,
right now , it &apos;s this big ,
and we need it to be ... this big .
that &apos;s a lot less big .
yes , it &apos;s ... this much less big .
i &apos;m not even sure that &apos;s possible .
well , i ran it by some colleagues at mit ,
and they thought they could get it done in four months .
four months ?
yeah , we &apos;ll do it in two !
hi . i &apos;m dr. sheldon cooper .
i &apos;m the actual brains behind this project .
also , engineers aren &apos;t real scientists ,
mit &apos;s a trade school ,
and the death star is from star wars , not star trek !
but otherwise ,
thank you for your service .
howard told me you were working late , so i brought dinner .
oh , thanks . you know , i just wanted to get some work done
without people congratulating me about the baby every five minutes .
i spent my day alone in the lab
waiting for a rat to die of anthrax .
did you come here to bring me dinner or to gloat ?
well , i came to see how you were feeling ,
but i &apos;m guessing still angry ?
i &apos;m sorry .
my boss wants to meet with me , and i &apos;m stressing .
you really think they &apos;re gonna start treating you differently ?
are you kidding ?
i &apos;ve always been treated differently !
look at me ! listen to me !
i mean , the first thought when you see me isn &apos;t ,
&quot; that &apos;s a scientist . &quot;
it &apos;s , &quot; i wonder if her mommy knows where she is . &quot;
i am really regretting that i got you a happy meal .
i &apos;ve worked so hard to get where i am ,
and i don &apos;t want to get sent back to square one
because i &apos;m pregnant .
i understand how you feel .
thank you .
i wish there were some way i could make it better .
well , you brought me french fries . that &apos;s a start .
uh , actually , i got you apple slices &apos; cause you &apos;re pregnant .
apple slices ?
what kind of lunatic goes to mcdonald &apos;s and gets fruit ? !
i &apos;ll be right back .
and a chocolate shake !
what are you doing ?
oh , leonard &apos;s mad at me , so i &apos;m making him lemon bars .
does he even like lemon bars ?
not really .
but i &apos;m mad at him , too , so lemon bars it is .
something happen at the meeting ?
they made me promise i wouldn &apos;t talk .
and you talked ?
well , now , see ?
you knew what was gonna happen .
why didn &apos;t they ?
anyway , now we &apos;re committed to completing this project
in a ridiculously short time frame ,
and everyone &apos;s upset with me .
well , if it makes you feel any better ,
bernadette &apos;s mad at me , too .
if it makes you feel any better ,
a parasitoid wasp known as oobius depressus
has been rediscovered after 101 years of presumed extinction .
why would that make me feel better ?
why would your bernadette thing make me feel better ?
at least mine was educational .
okay . never mind .
look , i &apos;m sorry .
tell me why bernadette is upset with you .
well , i told people at work that she &apos;s pregnant .
she wasn &apos;t ready for them to know .
why would you do that ?
well , it just slipped out . i feel terrible .
see , that &apos;s exactly what happened to me ,
except that i said it on purpose , and i have no regrets .
is it even possible to get this done in two months ?
well , maybe . i don &apos;t know .
we &apos;ll have to work 12 hours a day , seven days a week .
which means i won &apos;t be able to make penny breakfast every day ,
and she &apos;ll realize my brioche french toast
was the only thing keeping her in the marriage .
i love your french toast .
oh , thanks , man .
so , why did you guys even agree to the deadline ?
we didn &apos;t . sheldon did .
and you just let him ?
well , the colonel said it was for the good of the country ,
and the funding is substantial .
no , but mostly , there was an awkward pause ,
and i broke it by saying , &quot; okay . &quot;
so i guess i won &apos;t be seeing you guys for a while .
oh , looks like it . wow .
you &apos;re going off to work with the military , leaving me behind .
now i know how all those army wives feel .
would you stop ?
we &apos;re just gonna be on the other side of campus .
and right here .
you are a deeply silly man .
he is so afraid of his feelings .
got a minute ?
yeah , come on in .
i just wanted to apologize .
i know what you did was an accident .
oh , thank you , and i &apos;m sorry i lied about it .
for what it &apos;s worth , you &apos;re a great liar .
oh , that &apos;s what amy said .
so what &apos;s going on with the research project ?
are they gonna let you run it ?
well , my boss said he hadn &apos;t decided yet ,
so i gently reminded him
that he &apos;s an old rich white guy ,
and i &apos;m a sweet little pregnant lady
who &apos;s not afraid to cry in front of a jury .
you threatened to sue ?
hey , i learned a long time ago , when you &apos;re four feet eleven
and eye level with every guy &apos;s crotch ,
that &apos;s where you punch .
that &apos;s funny .
i learned something totally different .
do you know what ?
it &apos;s just a research project .
the most important job in the world
is gonna be raising this child .
it &apos;s all i need to give my life meaning .
oh , that &apos;s so beautiful .
you believe me ? oh , good .
11 more chumps like you ,
i &apos;ll have the jury eating out of my hand .
i never realized this building was classified .
maybe that &apos;s because it &apos;s classified .
wish we weren &apos;t so far from my parking space .
the way you put away those lemon bars ,
perhaps that &apos;s a good thing .
i &apos;d like to reinstate the you @-@ not @-@ talking rule .
why ? it clearly doesn &apos;t work .
i guess this is it .
不得吸烟
is that a retinal scanner ?
let &apos;s find out .
howard wolowitz-- access granted .
no way !
impressive !
oh , my turn ! my turn !
leonard hofstadter-- access granted .
i didn &apos;t even have to take my glasses off !
access denied .
it knows !
oh , oh , oh , oh , guys , hold me upside down !
howard wolowitz , access granted .
