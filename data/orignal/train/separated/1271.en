Go, son!
Let's go, buddy!
That was a cross-check, ref!
Are you blind?!
Excuse me.
I'm watching a game here.
Oh, my god! Use the whistle! That's what it's for!
Hey. Can I just squeeze by?
That is bullshit!
He checked my kid! You can't give him the penalty!
Please, excuse me.
That was my foot, lady.
Sorry. I was just trying to get by.
Please don't push me.
Now you made me miss the play.
Hey. I'm talking to you.
Next time, don't push, bitch.
Hey! That's offsides!
Oh. Not those.
What "not those"? You have six other identical pair.
They're not identical.
That's black patent, black suede, kitten heel.
Wish I had just one matching pair.
Clear the clutter, cleanse the soul.
I might need those.
Okay, so, you are not the person who hired my mother
to help you clean out your closet?
No.
Great. Let's go do something else.
No, I-I mean...yes.
Okay. Maybe the shoes are a little too overwhelming for you.
When was the last time you wore this dress?
I haven't had a chance.
I was with you when you bought it.
Three years ago.
Donation pile.
No, no! I paid to have it tailored.
Why? So we could lord it over all the other frumpy frocks?
So help me, if that is Amazon delivering more shoes...
Okay.
If you're doing this to help mom make extra money, please stop.
Okay. You're not responsible for her finances.
Yes, but we both know something's wrong.
Then why won't she just tell me?
I don't know.
Cailin, hi.
Uh, come on in.
Is everything okay?
My mom went to Europe.
You didn't go with her?
Well, here. Let me help. - No, it's -- it's fine. I got it.
What happened to your foot?
Well, I sprained my ankle.
Oh. Sorry.
I'm sorry you're not in Europe.
I have finals.
Listen. I know this is a lot to ask.
Can I stay with you?
With me?
Uh, yes, sure.
Sure. You don't want to be home alone?
I wasn't alone.
My mother hired Mrs. Craberton to babysit me.
You're 19.
I know. Right?
I knew you guys would understand.
Uh, so, how long is Hope gone?
Three weeks. Thank you.
Oh. Hey, dude.
Yeah, I did the homework.
Um, Cailin. W-where are you going?
Oh, is it okay if I just stay in your spare bedroom?
Yes, yes. I'll -- I'll show you where it is.
That's okay. I can find it.
No, I'm listening. Oh, my god. He so did not.
Oh, my god. He so did, too.
Three weeks?!
Well, you'll get to know each other better.
She's your half-sister.
Okay, we got a possible homicide in the parking lot
of the hockey rink out by Suffolk Downs.
That is like 100 decibels!
You know, I just read a report about hearing loss in adolescents.
It's up 30%. I'll meet you there.
Hey. Thanks for bringing me in on this.
I figured you should help out since we're hockey guys.
Jane's not working it?
She and Dr. Isles are almost here.
Well, before she elbows me out of the way,
can I get a minute of training?
You bet. Tell us what you see.
Well, the human body holds 6 quarts of blood.
There's about 5 of it on the ground.
Good. What else?
I don't see too many crime-scene markers.
Did you find a purse or a wallet?
No. Nothing on the body or nearby.
She's not wearing much jewelry except a cheap charm bracelet.
Maybe robbery was the motive.
Could be, but it's a pretty vicious way to kill somebody
if all you want is their purse and jewelry.
Hey. It's a youth hockey game.
You played, too, Frost.
I once saw two parents go at each other
with their kids' hockey sticks at a pee-wee game.
Sergeant Korsak, we've got 10 officers inside
on all the doors and exits.
Good. Nobody leaves.
Everybody in that rink is a suspect.
Hey, Wendy.
Hello, Detective Rizzoli.
This is Detective Frost.
Sir.
You want to take a look at this?
Really?
It's my dream to join homicide one day.
Is it okay if I take a look, Sir?
Be our guest.
Okay. It's madness, right?
That's one end of her carotid artery.
Ohh. I've only seen pictures of this stuff.
Wow. Incredible.
Frankie, write down all the tags.
I want a record of every vehicle down here.
You got it.
I'm heading inside.
Officer Rogers, I want another officer on that exit over there.
Yes, Sir. Thanks a lot, uh, detectives, Sir.
Let me know if you need anything -- coffee, anything.
Thanks.
Man!
I got to get over this.
Pretend it's that bag of giblets you pull out of a turkey
before you cook it.
Inside your turkey? Every turkey?
Come on, dude. You can do this.
Okay. Now...
Just a little bit at a time, okay?
You good?
I wouldn't say "Good," but keep going.
It works. I'm not gagging.
What did he use -- a dull can opener?
Is that her tongue hanging out?
Oh, god.
Damn.
That did it. Dinner's still inside.
All right.
I'm not brave enough to stop a tied youth hockey game.
Looks like we don't have a choice.
Hey, ref!
Boston Police! Stop the game! Oh! Ref!
Blow the whistle! Stop the game!
Back away, mom!
What?
Hey! I'm a cop! Stop the game!
I don't care if you're the queen of England! Move, mom!
Oh, you know what?
You call me "mom" one more time
and you watch where I put that whistle.
It's a police emergency. Stop the game. Now.
All right, all right, look.
We're very sorry to interrupt your game.
Okay, we are here to investigate a crime.
What kind of crime?
Sir, step back, please.
No, we had this in the bag.
I want to know how long it's gonna take.
Longer if you don't step back.
This is crap. If my son's not playing, we're out of here.
Nobody is leaving the arena.
Unless it's in the back of a squad car.
Can we have all parents standing with their children, please?
Pair up.
Pair up. Everybody get with your parents.
Hmm. There's no parent with that boy.
Hey, Drew. Where's your mom?
I-I don't know.
Anybody know where his mom is?
Uh, sometimes she goes outside to smoke
when the kid's line is off the ice.
Son, what's your name?
Drew -- Drew Bigsby.
Okay, Drew. We're gonna step outside.
We're gonna look for your mom, okay?
And what's her name?
Mary Bigsby.
Could -- could you stay with him for a few minutes?
Yeah, sure. No problem. Wh-what's going on?
Everything's okay. If we could all just stay inside, please?
Okay? Keep him inside, please. Thank you.
Nobody leave the arena.
I'm seeing blood droplets far apart.
She was in a hurry.
So she was bleeding when she left the rink,
which doesn't make sense.
Why not?
Come on. Take a look at the body.
Tell me what you think.
Hey, Frost.
Can you run a DMV search on Mary Bigsby?
Is that Mary?
Think so.
Here we go.
Mary Bigsby drives a blue minivan.
I got the tags right here. We'll find it.
Your mother is staying with Cailin.
Do you think that's okay?
Do I think it's okay
that my mother is babysitting a grown adult?
No, I do not.
Hope was so insistent.
Hope should back off.
Just talk to me about the body.
She has a broken nose and a jagged injury to her throat.
See what doesn't make any sense?
What doesn't make sense?
Two injuries -- broken nose and a slashed throat.
They're separate.
Well, how do you know that?
Well, the blood spatter says
that she was ambushed from behind,
But the droplets from her busted nose
says that she was punched over there.
You think we're looking for two attackers?
Maybe.
I think there may be a speed-burn mark under the blood.
You're right.
No bloody tire tracks, though.
So what does that mean?
Somebody was going in reverse, braked hard here,
and then sped off before she bled out.
You think the killer took the victim's car?
We find her keys?
Negative. You think we're looking at a carjacking?
You got a choice of cars, you steal a minivan?
Frankie's got eyes on Mary Bigsby's minivan.
Someone inside.
All right, you take the right.
Boston Police. Put your hands on the wheel now.
Do not move your hands. Keep them on that wheel.
All right, when I tell you,
you clasp your hands behind your head.
Do it now.
All right. Now slowly get out of the car.
Keep your hands where they are.
We've got blood.
Oh, come on.
See if she has any I.D.
All this over a hockey-mom shoving match?
You are Mary Bigsby?
That's right.
Take her in for questioning.
Let's go. Come on.
If that's Mary Bigsby... who's that?
Hey, fellas. Need you to take a look at the victim.
You recognize her?
Ew. It's horrible. Yeah.
She looks like that lady
who showed up during practice, doesn't she?
Yeah, I think so.
You know her name?
No. She was very nice.
She was a saleslady.
Saleslady.
Yeah, she gave one of these to all the players.
No-drip helmet pads.
The kids wore them while they warmed up.
The kids were really excited
because she said the pads could tell if they were dehydrated.
How do they do that?
No idea.
She gave the kids baggies,
had them write their names on them,
and she collected them before the game.
She took back used helmet pads?
Yeah, she's gonna analyze them
and bring the results to the next game.
Did you see what kind of car she drove?
No.
No, sorry.
Thank you both.
I'm gonna look up that company.
Are we really thinking someone in here did this?
I mean, wouldn't they be covered in blood?
Not necessarily.
Arterial blood spray projected forward.
No such thing as no-drip helmet pads.
How can that be?
Our dead Jane Doe worked for a company that doesn't exist?
Okay, thanks.
Crime lab has the results on the blood on Mary's shirt.
It matches our victim's.
Who wants to face off against a killer hockey mom?
Been there, done that.
I had to live through my mother's hockey-mom years.
Your mother is too nice to be one of those mothers.
Oh, yeah? Ask her about the time
that she stormed out onto the ice
in the middle of Frankie's game
and hit the ref with her purse.
What did Frankie do?
Tried to change his last name.
We'll take this one, then.
Okay. Good. I'm going down to autopsy.
Puncture wound is 0.5 centimeters at the apex.
12.7 centimeters of jagged tear.
Ugh. It's like someone pulled her throat open with claws.
What kind of murder weapon does that?
It snagged the carotid. Notice I said "snagged."
I noticed.
Notice how much I would love to know what the murder weapon is.
Carotid artery was pulled until it tore.
I notice you said "pulled."
I did. By a weapon with a curved end.
Okay. We'll put out an all-points bulletin for Captain Hook.
There's a beige, gummy substance in the wound.
The lost boys' gummy bears?
It's Hope. Again.
All right.
Hello?
Yes. You know, I am just in the middle of an autopsy.
No.
I do not know if Cailin did her homework,
but she's a sophomore in college.
Okay, I will. I will make sure she goes to bed.
Okay, bye-bye.
Wow. No wonder Cailin is frustrated.
I am so glad that Constance taught me to be independent.
What do I do?
That's what they invented voicemail for, Maura.
I can't.
Hello?
Yes. Yes.
No, I did say that I would monitor her
and make sure she takes her immunosuppression drugs.
No, no, no. You have every right to worry.
Okay. I'm sorry.
All right, bye-bye.
Okay, you just encouraged her to worry.
I just keep forgetting that Cailin had a kidney transplant.
How do you forget? It's your kidney.
No hits.
Who are you?
You have a lot of scripts, Mary.
Disturbing the peace, assault and battery,
assault with a deadly weapon?
Deadly weapon? It was a hockey stick.
Which you used to break a referee's arm.
He made bad calls, so I said something, and he got personal.
Is that what sets you off? When someone gets personal?
He called me a pig with lipstick.
Man's lucky I don't have a temper.
What did she call you?
Is she dead? What happened to her?
You tell us. We found her blood on your clothes.
I punched her in the nose. That's it. I didn't kill her.
Did you get into it with her at the game over your kids?
She didn't even have a kid.
How do you know?
It's a small league.
I know all the parents. Never seen her before.
You just like punching strangers?
I was trying to watch the game, and that lady kept pushing me,
and then she rolls her case over my foot.
What case?
I don't know. Some sales case.
It hurt, so I pushed her back.
Must have pushed her pretty hard.
I am telling you, I didn't kill her.
Just one punch, and I watched her walk away.
Look at my file --
just fat lips, bloody noses, and a ref's arm.
Add a slashed throat.
Oh, god. I think I'm gonna be sick.
We're holding hockey mom, but I don't think she's our killer.
That lady's as squeamish as Frost.
Lady? She puked on the table.
Did she I.D. the victim, at least?
No.
Damn. Well, Maura's checking her dental records.
What else can we do?
Every car in that parking lot is accounted for.
Okay.
There is no bus service in that area,
there is no record of a taxi dropping anyone off,
and there is no way that she walked more
than half a block in those heels,
which means she had a car.
And we showed all the parents, employees,
and coaches her photo.
Kids remembered her handing out helmet pads.
No one knew her name.
Killer took everything that could identify her.
Except her body.
Maybe because he was interrupted.
He pulls the car back, he stops here.
Maybe he was about to dump her body in the trunk
and that's when Mary came out to smoke.
That makes sense.
But if we can't I.D. her, we're screwed,
unless she had a car and we can find it.
Jane, I'm sorry to interrupt.
What's the matter?
Cailin's missing.
Angela, is Cailin here?
No, honey.
She's not here, Jane.
No, I'm not asking you to leave work.
Okay.
I can't find Cailin.
Um, well, when's the last time you talked to her?
Four hours ago.
Yes. Yes, I checked all the hospitals.
And you checked back with the state troopers, right?
Maura, it's only 11:30. She is a teenager.
I think we should file a missing person's.
Yes, please, Jane.
Okay. Thank you.
Are you really gonna put out a missing person's bulletin?
She could be at school.
Well, I told her she had to stay in touch with me.
Did you give her a curfew?
No. I didn't know I needed to.
Where the hell have you been?
At the library.
Well, you cannot do that.
I can't go to the library?
No, you -- you cannot not return my texts.
Oh. Sorry. I-I turned my phone off.
I was studying.
We -- we filed a missing person's report on you.
Oh, my god. Why would you do that?
Because I didn't know where you were!
I thought...
I thought you were different.
You thought if you stayed with me
that you could just do whatever you wanted.
Maura doesn't have kids.
I'm not a kid.
No, you're not, but she is responsible for you.
Well, I don't see how sending the police on a wild goose chase
is responsible.
You know, I have to call Jane
and tell her not to put a BOLO out for you.
Yeah, she might have better things to do,
like solve a murder.
Well, I know I have better things to do
than take care of an irresponsible, selfish teenager.
Maura.
Look, she was just worried. That's all.
Come on. Have a brownie.
Only if they have weed in them.
You brought marijuana here?
Yeah, 'cause that's what an irresponsible,
selfish teenager would do.
It's a joke!
Listen, I'm sure you're stressed-out
studying for your finals.
Why don't you go take a bath? I'll bring you a cup of tea.
Okay.
I never get that angry.
That's what a fight with a sibling feels like.
It'll be okay, Maura.
Oh, my god.
Shut up. Why would you let him do that?
Good morning.
You're up early.
Yeah, we -- we never went to bed.
Right. Why go to bed?
You don't need any sleep for
rigorous premed coursework.
I'm sure you didn't need it, either,
Because you're a genius like Cailin.
She aces everything with or without sleep.
Does she?
You can take a shower, if you want.
Oh. Am I embarrassing you?
I think you look great.
Yeah, me too.
It's so cool when women your age
look good even without makeup.
My age?
It's a compliment, Maura.
Really?
I almost tripped over this young man.
I thought the homeless moved in to Beacon Hill.
Dylan's from Santa Cruz. He misses sleeping outside.
Yeah, I-I love sleeping under the stars.
Your brick walkway's not very comfortable, though.
Cailin, can I speak to you upstairs?
Man, that looks good.
Cool. Good thing it's for you, then.
You are quite the hostess.
You made breakfast for... Dylan, is it?
Yeah, hey. How's it going?
Cailin, that looks delicious.
Yours is in the oven, Mrs. Rizzoli.
So, do you want to talk now
or eat before your food gets cold?
I wanted to scream when I saw my kitchen.
Yeah, well, children push buttons you didn't even know you had.
Well, she's not my child.
She's an adult...child.
You know, I read somewhere
the brain isn't fully developed until 26,
which explains a lot.
Well, maybe Hope is right in treating her like a kid.
All she did was have a couple of friends over and make a mess.
Which we cleaned up.
But she wasn't trying to get under your skin.
She needs to learn. Set some boundaries.
You know, I barely know her. I don't want her to hate me.
Look, teenagers are like big toddlers.
You would see the cute toddler
in her if she was yours.
Maura, she's a good kid.
And she worships you.
No, she doesn't.
Yes, she does.
Set some boundaries, then stick to them.
Oh, crap. I am so late.
Bye. Have a good day.
Um, Cailin?
I would appreciate it if you cleaned up after yourself.
Sure. Yeah. I'll do it later. Bye.
Bye.
How was that?
Good.
I just don't understand she could be so oblivious.
Come on. I was a slob when I was 19.
And I bet you didn't start color-coordinating your hangers
until you were in your 20s.
I was always neat.
Okay. Cailin is a good person. She's a good student.
Does she have to be a good cleaner, too?
No.
Yes.
Morning. Anything?
No. Still a Jane Doe.
Frost and I went through all the tow records
and parking tickets near the hockey rink.
Nothing stands out.
We're still no closer to finding that phantom car.
Results on the gummy substance in the wound came back.
The weapon had traces of paraffin, polyester fibers,
and clotrimazole on it.
What's clotrimazole?
Anti-fungal cream.
So our killer has jock itch or athlete's foot.
Wait. Paraffin? Wax.
Killer was a hockey player.
A skater's shoelaces are made of polyester
and then rubbed down with wax so that they don't fray.
Uh, the weapon is not a shoelace.
No, but...
...could be something used to tighten the laces.
Like what?
Skate hook.
Maura, you said it had a hooked end.
Could a skate hook be the murder weapon?
Well, the puncture wound was 0.05 centimeters.
That is consistent with it. It does have a blunt edge.
I'd have to test one and compare it
to the wound track of the victim.
I'm gonna get a coffee. Anybody want anything?
Yeah. I'd like a big jelly doughnut.
I get really hungry
when we talk about ripping apart someone's throat.
Attaboy, Frost.
Hey, there.
Hello, Vince.
What are you doing taking out the trash?
You want me to knock Stanley around?
No, I'm -- I'm just recycling.
Everything all right?
Yeah.
You're not recycling.
What are you doing, Angela?
Sit down.
I should have signed those divorce papers.
I will now.
For all the good it'll do me.
Oh, boy. What happened?
I don't want my kids to know any more bad stuff
about their father.
I'm a vault.
He didn't pay our taxes.
Uh-oh. How much do you owe?
$27,000.
That's a lot of cans.
Yeah, but I have several jobs I'm doing,
and -- and I'll find a way.
I-I always do.
You work hard enough.
Let me loan it to you, interest-free.
It's not a problem.
I can't take your money, Vince.
But thank you.
I've tested every manufacturer's skate hook.
This is the last one.
What do you think?
Well, it's consistent with the victim's wound
in both depth and edge pattern.
So, our victim and our murder weapon
came out of that hockey rink.
Maybe our killer did, too.
So, how many people were at the rink
when the first responders showed up?
58 parents, 30 kids,
2 coaches, and 5 rink employees.
We ran them all.
Only crazy hockey mom Mary had a record.
And who here thinks she's the killer?
A skate hook is a weapon of opportunity.
If you're killing somebody with that,
in a public place, you're not planning this.
Yeah, and why was our victim
pretending to be a helmet-pad saleswoman?
And what's with all the sweat analyzing?
She's looking for something. Or maybe someone.
Yeah, you can get DNA from sweat.
Only kids were wearing them,
so maybe she was looking for a kid.
Maybe. Okay, let's go back to my missing-car theory.
He killer didn't want the victim to be identified,
so if she had a car, he got rid of it.
Harbor is right near the rink.
Best place to deep-six a car is the bottom of the sea.
And we can't call the dive team
and have them search the entire harbor.
No, but we could ask them
to search the end of pier 21.
Somebody's in a guessing mood today.
It's more than a guess.
Road construction
has all the streets in that area shut down
except the one to pier 21.
And that area is abandoned, too.
Nobody would see you push a car off a pier.
And while we're bothering the dive team,
we might as well bring everybody in
who had access to a skate hook,
including parents and ice-rink employees.
And we can rule out kids and coaches
'cause they were on or near the ice.
That's still 65 people.
Who's gonna do all those interviews?
Hey, Frankie.
What are you doing today?
How would you feel about doing some interviews
for the hockey-rink homicide we're working?
Love to.
Yeah, I need divers in the water off pier 21.
Looking for a car.
You want a description?
How about you let me know if you find more than one?
Thank you.
Frankie, make 65 copies of that.
Okay. Why?
Yeah, why?
'Cause we haven't had a break in this case,
and it's time we got creative.
Take a look at this photo, would you?
Do you recognize her?
I don't. Sorry.
Take another look.
I just said I've never seen her. You don't listen.
Can I go?
Korsak.
Where?
I'm on the way.
Jane felt sorry for Frankie.
She's helping him finish the interviews.
Divers found a late-model
Ford Focus off pier 21.
They're pulling it out of the drink now.
Should I tell Jane?
Only if you want to switch places with her.
I'd rather watch the big crane pull the car out of the ocean.
Is that so wrong?
No. Come on.
This is so cool.
Wouldn't it be great if there were a couple of lobsters in there?
Cannot believe I told Frankie I would help him.
I don't ever want to talk to another hockey parent
as long as I live.
Oh! Angela's pick-me-ups.
Well, ma, I do hope you're not selling speed
to the secretarial pool.
No, you know, it's that 3:00 slump.
And Stanley doesn't mind?
I'm filling a need. I'm not taking his business.
Okay, ma, enough. What's going on?
It isn't anything I want to talk about.
You'd tell me if you were in trouble, right?
Yeah.
Jane, I just enjoy baking, okay?
Okay.
Maybe she just doesn't want to burden you.
There are certain things my mother will not talk about.
Money problems is at the top of that list.
Speaking of problems,
have you talked to Cailin in the last five seconds?
Well, I told her she has to check in with me every 30 minutes.
Ok. No.
You're the one with the problem.
Me? Well, I'm just trying to create boundaries.
Give her what she wants -- a relationship.
Okay, she came to you as a big sister,
not as another mother.
Hey, Frost. What's up?
Jane, I think we found the victim's car.
That's great.
There's a purse...
and a wallet and a cellphone.
Yeah, it's the victim's.
Found her no-drip helmet-pad sales case.
Okay. What's her name?
Carla Dalton, 42 years old.
She has a Rhode Island driver's license.
And a Cohasset address.
Hey. We have a parking permit.
Looks like she worked at Easton labs.
Easton labs? Maybe they make helmet pads.
Mm. No, no. Easton labs is a pharmaceutical company.
They make drugs for neurological diseases.
Carla Dalton was an M.D.
She was Easton labs' director of clinical research.
Tell Frankie to go with Korsak to her residence.
You meet me at Easton labs.
Will do.
Our victim has a name -- Dr. Carla Dalton.
Oh, god.
Yes, that's Dr. Dalton. She was a wonderful woman.
Was she based here in Boston?
No. Um, she was only in this office for a few months.
Our headquarters are in New York.
But I supervised her research, so we talked frequently.
Do you know if she was married?
No, she wasn't.
No children, either,
Which is probably why she was such a dedicated researcher.
What kind of research was she doing?
Her passion was Huntington's disease.
Huntington's is an incurable hereditary brain disorder
that damages nerve cells and incapacitates you.
It's fatal.
Did Dr. Dalton have Huntington's?
I never asked. She once told me that her sister had it.
We should have Maura do a blood test, find out.
Do you know what Dr. Dalton was working on
at the time of her death?
She was conducting drug trials.
She was determined to find a cure for Huntington's.
Do you have any idea
why Dr. Dalton would be attending boys' hockey games
and distributing these?
I have no idea.
These don't have anything to do with her research.
Is there any reason that she would be collecting samples of perspiration from adolescent boys?
Well, that's the group that she was focused on,
but the only way to detect Huntington's is with a blood test.
So all of her subjects were adolescent boys ages 12 to 14?
Yes. She said she wanted to study juveniles.
Seems like a pretty specific sample group.
Yes, it is, but Dr. Dalton insisted.
Excuse me. It's Korsak.
Please, feel free to use our conference room.
Thank you for your time. We're very sorry for your loss.
Hey, Korsak. You at her apartment?
Yeah, but somebody got here first.
They left her research notebooks,
but the computer's gone.
Well, whoever tossed her apartment
probably had something to do with the murder.
We'll pack everything up.
The killer might have missed something.
Okay, that's a lot of helmet pads.
What?
Used No-Drip Helmet Pads -- Hundreds of them.
So, Carla did drug trials in Miami, Annapolis, Houston,
Corpus Christi, Portland,
Seattle, and Boston, which is the same places
that she collected the sweaty helmet pads for.
And every city she picked was near an ocean.
Yeah.
She was focused on three things --
12- to 14-year-old male hockey players,
Huntington's disease, and coastal cities.
She was looking for somebody --
Someone connected to these three things.
So, Dr. Carla Dalton did not have
the genetic marker for Huntington's.
What do you make of her data from her drug trials?
Well, let's see.
The research subjects are all anonymous.
They all have a number and identifying information,
Like this.
The subject is a 13-year-old boy from Boston
who likes skateboarding and science fiction.
Okay. Why is this boy circled?
14-year-old from Boston.
Enjoys hockey and sailing.
Where are the helmet pads from Boston?
Not much use. They were in the trunk of her car.
Hmm, how odd -- she was running DNA
She extracted from sweat in the helmet pads
against DNA from her Huntington's test subjects.
And this is even odder.
What?
She's comparing the results to her own DNA.
I got more info on Carla Dalton.
She was originally from Newport, Rhode island.
CSRU is pulling prints from the submerged car
to compare to the 65 people you and Frankie interviewed.
Well, how did you get the prints from the parents
and the rink employees?
Jane had them all handle a photo of the victim.
Hmm. Genius.
There's a date engraved on this sailboat charm.
July 17, 2001.
July 17th. Hang on. I just saw that.
Frost, Bring up Carla's phone records for July 17th.
Did she call anyone?
A few Boston numbers and a call to Rhode Island.
Go back a year.
She called the same Rhode Island number.
Go back another year.
There it is again.
Run it.
It's registered to a Jonathan Mcknight.
Yes, hello.
This is detective Jane Rizzoli from Boston homicide.
Oh, you are?
Well, we're investigating the murder of Dr. Carla Dalton.
Well, I'm very sorry to hear that.
Uh, yes. Yeah, tomorrow morning would be fine.
Okay. Thank you very much, Sergeant.
Sergeant?
Jonathan Mcknight is retired homicide detective.
He knew Carla, and he wants to talk to us tomorrow.
I always worried that Carla was right --
this is how it would end.
How what would end?
I met Carla 12 years ago.
This is Carla with her sister, Bridget.
Bridget, her husband, Michael,
and their 2-year-old son, Todd.
All died in a boating accident, July 17, 2001.
Well, wait. You're a retired homicide detective.
Why would you be investigating a boating accident?
Carla was convinced it wasn't an accident.
Did you find the bodies?
Only Bridget's body washed up.
What was the cause of death? Drowning.
And what did Carla think happened
to her brother-in-law and her nephew?
She was convinced that Michael killed his wife,
faked his own death so he could take their son.
What did you think?
That she didn't have any proof.
Did Carla know if Michael ever threatened her sister?
She said there was tension in the marriage,
that Bridget had some terrible illness.
Huntington's disease.
Yes, that's it.
It's passed down from the mother.
Bridget's son has a 50/50 chance of inheriting it.
The intersecting circles.
14-year-old boy who played hockey and lived near the ocean.
Carla was looking for her nephew.
Oh, yeah.
She was obsessed with finding Todd
and bringing Michael to justice.
I wanted to help her. I...
There was nothing to go on.
Why would Michael stage a boating accident?
I mean, there are easier ways
to leave your spouse and get custody.
Well, after Michael's presumed drowning,
the investment firm he worked for
said he was under investigation
for embezzling millions.
So get rid of your wife, take your son and the money,
and no one will look for you if you're dead.
Did Michael have any connection to hockey?
He played semi-pro. He was a real fanatic.
He'd dress that boy in hockey shirts
and had him on skates as soon as he could walk.
You never change your hobbies,
and Michael had two of them -- sailing and hockey.
Do you have Michael's prints on file?
Michael Leahy. Right here.
This is everyone we interviewed.
That one. Load that one up, Frankie.
Those are Michael Leahy's prints, all right.
Pull up the DMV photo on the ones that match.
Doug Pierce. You recognize him?
Hmm. Maybe.
He's had surgery.
His eyes are similar and so are his ears.
This is the same man.
So Doug Pierce is Michael Leahy.
We got him.
Doug Pierce remarried,
I bet wife number two has no idea
he murdered wife number one.
He keeps a low profile.
Works as an investment adviser from his home.
I sent uniforms, but he won't be there.
Guy's on the run.
Okay. All right, thanks.
His son, who has perfect attendance,
didn't go to school today.
Why would he voluntarily come in and do an interview with me?
I remember Doug Pierce. He was calm.
Well, he was buying time.
If he didn't show up, we'd know it was him.
This way, he keeps us investigating,
and he gets a head start.
He knows we've got him on a watch list at the airport.
Do a search.
See if Doug Pierce is a registered boat owner.
What do you know?
You're not going with us.
Yes, I am.
What are you gonna do if he starts to run?
Hobble.
Thank you.
This is gonna be awesome.
Yeah. Not much wind.
No sign of Michael.
The hatch is open. He's down below.
Frankie, get the kid and the wife off, fast as you can.
Ready?
Boston police! Get off the boat!
Why?
Step off the boat, Mrs. Pierce.
Wait. What's going on? - Mom --
Luke, come on. You, too. Come on.
Okay. Go, go, go. Let's go. Come on.
Don't move.
It's over, Michael.
Michael? What? You have the wrong man.
Carla see you at the ice rink?
Or did you go after her after you saw her?
You saw her.
Why couldn't she just let me be?
She was watching the game, wasn't she?
Hoping one of those boys was her nephew.
Like a freaking bloodhound.
12 years later, she tracks me down,
shows up like a ghost at my son's game,
wrecking my life.
Just like her damn sister.
You know how she found you?
You signed your son up for her drug trial.
Five years she spent comparing her DNA to hundreds of boys
trying to find her sister's son.
While also trying to find a cure for Huntington's.
Now, that a good person.
Dad, why are they talking about Huntington's?
How do they know?
Sheila, get Luke the hell out of here.
No, dad, what's happening? Who's Carla?
What did you tell him when he cried out for his mother?
His mother? She abandoned him.
I am his mother.
Sheila, shut up and get him the hell out of here!
Come on. - No, dad --
Michael Leahy, you are under arrest
for the murders of Carla Dalton and Bridget Dalton Leahy.
Dad! Dad!
I can still hear that poor kid yelling, "Dad!"
Carla was so close. So tragic.
But it's beautiful, too, how much she loved her sister.
I'm guessing you're not gonna offer me a glass of wine.
We could pretend it's France.
It's okay. I got a guy that can buy me a six-pack.
I'm kidding.
I hear you're a good cook.
Yeah. You want me to make you something?
Are you planning to clean up after yourself?
Is that part of the deal?
No.
We could order takeout.
You could help me throw out the boxes.
Deal.
Yeah.
Deal.
