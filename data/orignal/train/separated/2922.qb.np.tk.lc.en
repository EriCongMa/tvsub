phoebe . will you check out that guy by the window . wow !
that guy back there ? he &apos;s awfully short . and i think he &apos;s talking to himself .
and to be completely honest , he &apos;s not that good in bed .
really ?
what is wrong with me lately ? it &apos;s like , every guy i see .
i mean , look at that guy , for example .
that &apos;s not someone i would be attracted to .
but right now , with the way i &apos;m feeling ..
all i want to do is rip off his sweatpants and fanny pack .
wait a second ! this is about the fourth month of your pregnancy , right ?
yeah .
this is completely normal .
around the fourth month , your hormones start going crazy .
really ? so this has happened to you ?
absolutely !
and keep in mind now , i was carrying triplets .
so in medical terms , i was thrice as randy .
wow , this explains so much !
last weekend , i went from store to store , sitting on santas &apos; laps .
yeah , i remember trying to steal a cardboard cutout ..
of evander holyfield from a foot locker .
well , i go see my doctor tomorrow . i &apos;ll ask her about this .
maybe she can give me a pill or something .
yeah , that &apos;s what you need . a good pill .
oh , no . short , crazy guy recognizes me . worst mistake of my life .
call me .
the.one.with.the.creepy.holiday.card
i got our pictures developed from rockefeller center .
great . hey , joey , want to check out pictures of me and mona ice @-@ skating ?
ordinarily , i would love to , but i am just swamped right now .
where are the pictures that that creepy pretzel vendor took of us together ?
oh , yeah . probably at the end .
oh , my god ! all he took were pictures of my breasts .
i &apos;m missing picture time !
you know , she has a face , ross .
i didn &apos;t take these , okay ?
i didn &apos;t even know my camera had a zoom lens .
&quot; comma , officer . &quot;
okay , here &apos;s a good one of us .
wow , that is a good one !
it looks like a holiday card.with the tree in the middle and the skaters and the snow .
good job , pretzel pervert .
every year , i say i &apos;m gonna send out holiday cards and i never do it .
do you want to send this one out together ?
together ? like , to people ?
yeah . &quot; happy holidays , from mona and ross . &quot; it &apos;ll be cute , okay ?
okay .
i gotta get to work . call me later ?
sure , sure .
bye , guys .
bye .
congratulations ! you just got married !
i know . can you believe that ?
i &apos;m sorry . what &apos;s the big deal about a holiday card ?
married couples send out cards . families send out cards .
people who have been dating for a couple of months don &apos;t send out cards .
what is she , crazy ?
that &apos;s your wife you &apos;re talking about !
no , really . i mean , that would be like a huge step forward .
i like things just the way they are .
i &apos;m finally in a relationship that &apos;s not moving too fast .
you know , ordinarily , i &apos;d be divorced by now .
okay , so just tell her you don &apos;t wanna send out the card . what &apos;s she gonna do ?
this .
oh , okay . i didn &apos;t mean to put pressure on you ..
i just thought it would be something fun for us to do together ..
but okay , that &apos;s okay .
okay , stop . stop . you &apos;re right , it &apos;s not that big a deal . i &apos;ll do the card .
what ? i said i &apos;d do it .
i know , it &apos;s just ..
can i have $ 20 ?
hi . you ready for lunch ?
one second .
that &apos;s cute .
bing ! and the bingette !
i thought it felt a little hotter in the office today .
oh , honey , you remember my boss , doug .
yes . hi .
good news ! the divorce is final . i signed the papers this a.m.
i didn &apos;t know you and kara divorced . i &apos;m sorry .
sorry ? i finally chewed my leg out of that bear trap .
congratulations to you guys , though .
no leg @-@ chewing for us , sir .
well , give it time .
so the divorce , the marriage , we got a lot to celebrate .
how about we all go out to dinner tomorrow night .
i can &apos;t think of anything we &apos;re doing .
why can &apos;t i think of anything we &apos;re doing ?
tomorrow night it is . i should be out of court by 6 .
they keep throwing sexual harassment cases at me ..
and i keep knocking them out of the park !
okay , see you tomorrow .
just so you know , we &apos;re not seeing him tomorrow .
honey , once you get to know him , he &apos;s much , much worse .
i can &apos;t do this alone .
honey , i &apos;m sorry . i can &apos;t help you . i can &apos;t spend another evening with that man .
do you remember how he behaved at our wedding ?
that &apos;s because he wasn &apos;t invited .
because of the way he behaved at our engagement party .
oh , yeah ! urine cuts right through an ice sculpture , doesn &apos;t it ?
oh , what the hell ? b plus .
hi ! i went by the photo shop . take a look .
here is a mockup of our card . what do you think ?
wow , that &apos;s great .
do you think it should say , &quot; love , ross and mona &quot; ?
well , we haven &apos;t said that to each other yet ..
but i guess it &apos;s okay to say it to other people .
how many did you want ? i &apos;ll get 100 .
a hundred ?
well , i guess i &apos;ll take ..
mona ?
i &apos;m not sure about the whole card thing .
really ? why not ?
sending out a holiday card together ?
i just don &apos;t know if we &apos;re really quite there yet .
i didn &apos;t think of it that way . you &apos;re right .
so can i ask you a question ?
yeah .
where are we ?
you know , where are we ? where is this relationship going ?
i love spending time with you . i just hope we &apos;re moving forward .
we should talk about that , don &apos;t you think ?
let &apos;s do the card !
what ?
the card ! i think we &apos;re there !
okay . but i still think we should have this conversation .
really ?
even with the card ?
just so you know , dr. long can &apos;t be here today , so dr. schiff will be seeing you .
oh , okay . can i ask you a question ?
was it me , or was the guy who took my blood sample really cute ?
you know who i &apos;m talking about ? bowl haircut , hairy fingers ?
actually , never mind . i just answered my own question .
hi , rachel ? i &apos;m dr. schiff .
yes , you are .
okay , now he &apos;s cute , right ?
oh , god , yes .
so , how &apos;s it going ?
it &apos;s going really good . but enough about me ! come on .
where are you from ? what do you do ?
i &apos;m a doctor .
right . i meant ..
in your spare time . do you cook ? so you ski ?
or just hang out with your wife , or girlfriend ?
i don &apos;t have a wife or a girlfriend , but i do like to ski .
i love to ski ! how amazing is this ?
are you experiencing any discomfort ?
no , i &apos;m very comfortable .
any painful gas ?
no !
dr. schiff ! what kind of question is that ?
okay , then . would you like to lie down on the table ?
would you like me to lie down on the table ?
is there something going on here ?
do you feel it too ?
hi .
how did your doctor &apos;s appointment go ?
well , let &apos;s see , they gave me &quot; cute boy &quot; doctor today .
in the middle of the exam , i put my pinkie in his chin dimple .
oh , my god !
why did you do that ?
remember that little problem i was having during my fourth month of pregnancy ?
oh , yeah ! the evander holyfield phase .
oh , man ! you were so hard up , you practically came on to me .
you wish .
hey , i could have had you if i wanted you .
oh , yeah ? come and get it .
okay , even this is turning me on . you guys , i got problems .
oh , hey . hey , ross ! how &apos;s it going with you and mona ?
are you guys still together ?
yeah , we &apos;re moving forward . you &apos;ll be getting our card .
you &apos;re doing a holiday card ?
we &apos;re not just doing a card . she also wants to have the conversation ..
about where the relationship is going .
women !
i know ! why do you guys need to have this conversation ?
no self @-@ respecting man would ask a woman , &quot; so where is this going ? &quot;
ross , you asked me that .
you were a closed book , okay ? i &apos;m not a mind reader !
what are you gonna say to her ? where is this relationship going ?
i don &apos;t know . i really like her and i wanna keep dating her .
so tell her that .
no , i can &apos;t .
because then she &apos;s gonna say , &quot; well , it &apos;s not moving anywhere ..
then we should just break up . &quot;
yeah , that &apos;s true .
besides , i hate those conversations . i &apos;m horrible at them . really .
maybe i need some kind of a gesture ..
something that says we &apos;re moving forward without having to talk about it .
like asking her to move in with you ?
smaller than that .
making her a mix tape ?
bigger than that .
give her a key to your apartment .
we were closer with the mix tape .
have you said , &quot; i love you &quot; ? you could say , &quot; i love you . &quot;
i don &apos;t think i &apos;m quite there yet .
but i could say , &quot; i love spending time with you . &quot;
we hate that .
that is a slap in the face .
forget it . you know what ? i &apos;ll just have the conversation .
i &apos;ll just say i like things the way they are , and hope for the best .
what do you think , rach ?
i think if it was a little colder in here ..
i could see your nipples through that sweater .
bing ? we &apos;re all set for tonight , 8 : 00 .
as it turns out , we can &apos;t do it . monica has to work .
my ex @-@ wife didn &apos;t work .
unless you call turning into her mother &quot; work . &quot;
fine . tomorrow night then .
tomorrow &apos;s no good for her , either .
why not ?
it &apos;s the semifinals ..
of her bocce ball tournament .
okay . the night after that then .
well , that &apos;s the finals , and i think she &apos;s gonna go all the way , sir .
what &apos;s going on , bing ? does your wife have a problem with me or something ?
well , now you &apos;re just talking crazy .
then why can &apos;t the three of us go out together ?
because we split up .
monica and i split up .
hold me .
good god , bing . well , i can &apos;t say i &apos;m altogether surprised .
i saw the way she looked at you , and there was no love there .
and the way she looked at me , pure lust .
what would really help me through this tough time is choking someone .
i know how you feel . oh , yeah .
i know what it &apos;s like to give a woman all your love ..
and then have that love thrown back in your face .
and then the court decides to give you custody of those fat , left @-@ handed twins .
well , they &apos;re lucky to have you , sir .
bing , my boy , we &apos;re gonna get you over this .
here &apos;s the plan : grab your coat , we &apos;re going to a strip club !
oh , no ! monica would freak .
but to hell with that bitch !
here we go .
mona , it &apos;s time we had a conversation about where things are with us .
yeah , i think i suggested that .
we are so ..
well , i really like you . and i love hanging out with you .
and i &apos;m having a lot of fun .
okay .
there &apos;s no point in spending time with someone if it &apos;s just fun .
it &apos;s gotta be going somewhere , right ?
so where is it going ?
that &apos;s the real question .
and the answer is ..
it &apos;s going somewhere ..
fun .
i know what you &apos;re thinking . fun was fine for you 10 years ago .
but you &apos;re not getting any younger .
no ! i mean , not you . not you .
you are getting younger !
you &apos;re getting younger by the second . what &apos;s your secret ?
i &apos;m sorry , so where are we ?
well , to sum up ..
we &apos;re having fun . you look young .
okay ..
but that &apos;s not enough .
so ..
here &apos;s a key to my apartment .
really ?
really .
you don &apos;t think this is too fast ?
you gave her a key to your apartment ?
not just a key . i gave her the only key !
i am now a homeless person in a very serious relationship !
why did you give her a key ?
she talked me into a corner , okay ?
she &apos;s like this conversational wizard .
so you had the conversation you didn &apos;t wanna have ..
and you made the gesture you didn &apos;t wanna make .
did i start this by saying , &quot; hey , i did something awesome today &quot; ?
do either of you have a key to my place ?
i don &apos;t think you &apos;ve ever given us keys .
yeah , why would i ? it &apos;s my home .
ross , how did the conversation go ?
great . i live on the street .
where ?
hi .
okay , monica , rachel ..
this is my friend roger .
hi , roger .
i &apos;ll get us some drinks . could you help me ?
yeah , okay .
he &apos;s here to have sex with you .
what ?
you &apos;re welcome .
phoebe , no !
it &apos;s okay . he &apos;s a virgin .
rachel , i was talking to this guy . i think he &apos;ll have sex with you .
let &apos;s leave these two alone .
no ! i don &apos;t care what my hormones are doing ! i won &apos;t do it with some random guy !
fine ! then you tell roger , because he was really looking forward to this !
bing ! look at those twin sisters dancing together .
let me buy you a lap dance with those girls .
that &apos;s all right , sir . and that &apos;s just one girl .
bing , what &apos;s this ?
it &apos;s a hand .
it &apos;s a thing you use as a jack and coke holder .
it &apos;s a wedding ring . get rid of it . we &apos;ll throw it in the east river !
no !
yes !
i did it , and i felt a lot better ! you might even hit a seagull in the head .
okay . i &apos;m gonna need a bunch of extra keys .
apparently , i give them away for no reason at all .
ross , what &apos;s going on ? you &apos;re changing the lock ?
no .
that guy is .
you give me a key to your apartment , and then you change the lock ?
good luck , buddy .
i thought we were moving forward . now you &apos;re sending me all these mixed signals .
what are you trying to tell me ?
i &apos;m trying to tell you ..
i made you a mix tape .
what ?
i love you .
and i love spending time with you .
hi , honey , i &apos;m home .
from the tequila factory ?
it was awful .
to get out of going to dinner with doug , i told him you and i split up .
so then he took me to these strip clubs and sleazy bars .
when i wouldn &apos;t give him my wedding ring , he threw a soda can at a bird .
come here . i can breathe through my mouth .
oh , sweetie .
you know what the worst part was ?
i got to see what my life would be like without you .
it was like it &apos;s a wonderful life with lap dances .
please promise me that you &apos;ll never leave me ..
that we &apos;ll grow old together , and be with each other for the rest of our lives .
i promise .
speaking of together , how about we send out a holiday card this year ?
i don &apos;t know if we &apos;re there yet .
i &apos;d like to order a pizza . can i ask you a question ?
is the cute blond guy delivering tonight ? very &quot; abercrombie &amp; fitch . &quot;
i &apos;ll call you back .
who was that ?
it &apos;s just the pizza place .
you hung up on the pizza place ?
i don &apos;t hang up on your friends .
sorry , honey , i &apos;m just having a rough day .
what &apos;s wrong ?
you don &apos;t want to hear about it .
then why did i ask ?
okay , this is really embarrassing , but lately , with this whole pregnancy thing ..
i &apos;m just finding myself ..
how do i put this ?
erotically charged .
is that college talk for &quot; horny &quot; ?
yeah . i have all of these feelings , and i don &apos;t know what to do about them .
i can &apos;t date like a normal person , which is fine because i don &apos;t need a relationship .
all i really want is one great night ! just sex .
no strings attached . no relationship .
with someone i feel comfortable with , and who knows what he &apos;s doing .
for just one great night . i mean , is that really so hard ..
to find ?
so how was your day ?
good . i saw a pretty big pigeon .
well , i gotta get up early , and it &apos;s almost 7 : 00 .
i gotta go to my room .
good night !
good night !
i can &apos;t do it !
i didn &apos;t ask you to do it !
you &apos;re rachel !
you &apos;re joey !
you &apos;re my friend !
right back at you .
yeah . plus , it would be wrong , and weird and bad !
so bad ! but i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about . i didn &apos;t ask you to do anything !
i know !
you wanna do it ?
no !
i &apos;m just testing you !
well , that &apos;s the end of this conversation !
this conversation never happened !
never happened !
good night !
good night !
get back in there !
listen , i &apos;m sorry about that whole thing with roger .
it really wasn &apos;t right . and i want to make it up to you .
so i brought you something i think you &apos;ll really enjoy .
evander holyfield
now this is just a loan , okay ? i &apos;m gonna want him back .
i &apos;m gonna go now .
