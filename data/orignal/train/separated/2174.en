Look at them go,
our every ready serviceman enjoy a little R&R
on the exotic island of Oahu,
the gathering place of the Hawaiian Islands,
where a veritable tropical paradise
meets a bustling metropolis.
But after a day of sand and surf,
it's back to work for these lucky boys
serving Uncle Sam
on the most beautiful place on Earth.
Keep up the good work, fellas!
America's proud of you!
Morning, Red.
Steak and egg special please.
Just the way I like it.
What the hell was that?
Artillery practice?
Someone better tell those guys it's Sunday.
let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go.
What the hell is going on?
Japs are bombing the island.
December 7, 1941...
President Roosevelt called it
"A date which will live in infamy."
On that peaceful Sunday morning over 70 years ago,
American forces withstood an unprovoked attack
and our nation was thrust headlong
into the largest global conflict in human history.
And though the guns have fallen silent,
we still gather at this very spot
where the attack took place to honor the survivors...
and the fallen--
members of our greatest generation--
and resolve to take care of them
as they took care of us.
You must know...
that we will never, ever forget
the sacrifices you made for your country.
I gotta tell you, Pearl Harbor Day, it always gets to me.
Every year.
Every single one of these veterans here today,
they are the definition of the word "Hero."
They experienced all the horrors of war,
and then they come home, they drop their duffel bags off,
and they go back to work supporting their families
the next day like nothing ever happened.
They certainly set the bar high.
Amazing.
What the hell are you doing?
Killing the man that murdered my father.
Take a seat, sir.
What's this guy in for, bingo brawl?
Tried to shoot one of the veterans at the Memorial today.
Mr. Toriyama, where'd you get this gun?
It was my service weapon.
And you can call me David.
You're a veteran, David?
Korean War.
Did these come with this?
You realize if you pulled the trigger,
this thing would have malfunctioned,
probably blown up in your face.
Then maybe you shouldn't have stopped me.
You said your name is McGarrett?
Hasn't changed since the last time you asked me.
Have we met before?
No, I don't think so.
I know you from somewhere.
Sir.
Sir, you said Ezra Clark killed you father.
How do you know that?
I was there.
That man is a murderer and a thief.
He dishonored my family
and he dishonors the United States military.
Okay, you know what? Take it easy. All right?
They're some serious charges.
Ezra Clark is a decorated soldier.
Now, if he killed your father,
why wasn't he prosecuted?
Son, if you know anything about World War II,
you'd know that a Japanese accusing a white soldier of a crime...
any crime would never be taken seriously.
Okay, what about after the war?
I tried.
But the police said there wasn't enough evidence
to open an investigation.
Okay, when did this alleged crime take place?
May 24, 1943.
Approximately 3:15 in the afternoon.
Why would Ezra Clark kill your father?
Our katana.
Ezra Clark shot my father for it.
A samurai sword.
That's right.
And it belonged to my family for centuries,
passed down from generation to generation.
If what you're telling us is true,
why are you going after Clark now?
My wife passed away 20 years ago.
And in August, my only child died in a car accident.
I couldn't dishonor them while they were alive,
but now, finding justice is all I have left.
Excuse me, David.
So, uh, what do you think? You believe him?
Why would he lie?
I don't know.
It was a long time ago, what he's talking about, right?
This guy served his country.
We owe it to him to find the truth.
If that is the truth,
it's been buried for about 70 years.
Last time I checked,
there's no statute of limitations for murder.
Our life on the island was beautiful before the war.
I was ten, and my brother Kenji was 17.
He was a great student,
terrific athlete and my hero.
Hey, who do you like best,
Joe DiMaggio or Hank Greenberg?
Are you kidding me?
It's like asking me what's better, chocolate or strawberry.
You know, they're both great, right?
Yeah.
Aloha, boys!
Mrs. Kennedy!
We lived in a house on Damon Street in the Manoa Valley.
Leave that outside.
Everybody knew us, and we knew them.
Kenji, you're looking really sharp out there.
A lot better than last year.
Thanks, Dad.
My father James taught history at Punahou School,
a 100-year-old institution.
It's where President Obama went.
My mother Martha was very civic-minded:
active in the PTA and community theater.
She also worked for her father,
who was a Hawaiian territorial senator.
All right, let's get down to business.
Topic of the day:
If you could invent one thing to make your everyday life easier,
what would it be?
Oh, I got this. That's easy.
Kenji would want a machine that makes girlfriends.
Well, David's gonna build a robot
that cleans his room and takes out the trash.
You boys.
That's a good one, too.
David, eat your vegetables.
They're not so bad.
Listen to you mother, she's always right.
Our neighborhood was a special place.
A big melting pot.
There was never any trouble, all of us got along great.
But then everything changed on December 7th.
In the weeks that followed,
the military began arresting prominent Japanese.
Teachers, bankers, lawyers,
Buddhist priests, newspaper editors,
and our community leaders.
I'll never forget the day they came for my family.
President Lincoln's speech in Springfield was like a prophecy.
He warned of the tragic consequences of a civil war.
He said, "A house divided against itself cannot stand."
Are you James Toriyama?
Y-Yes.
You're under arrest.
Under arrest? What's the meaning of this?
What... On what charges? What's going on here?
Why am I being arrested?!
Who are you? What do you want?
You're being detained by order of the United States Government.
On what charge?
Mind your manners, Jap.
Now you got two minutes to get your things together.
Only take what you can carry.
You can't do this.
We're American citizens! We have ri--
No! No...
Now you got one minute.
Hurry, boys.
Do what he says.
What about our house and the rest of our things?
Anything that you can't carry
is now property of the United States Government.
And if I were you, I'd get going.
Come on, lady... let's go!
That's right, keep walking!
Over here! Get in line!
Take a seat!
You, move over!
That's right, there's room for everybody.
James! James!
Martha?
Martha...
James!
Martha!
Over here!
Martha!
Get in line!
Are you all right?
I'm okay.
It's okay, son.
We're together now.
Move it. Let's go.
Let's go. Let's do what he says.
I was only ten,
but I'll never forget that humiliation.
Paraded like P.O.W.'s
in front of friends and neighborswe had grown up with.
And we were as American as they were.
They kept us in jail for a while...
Until
we were relocated to a camp
outside a gulch in Waipahu.
Its name was Honouliuli Internment Camp,
but we called it "Hell Valley"
because it was so damn hot.
And it wasn't a camp at all.
It was more like a prison.
Guard towers and searchlights.
There was barbed wire.
Armed soldiers patrolled the perimeters
and would shoot anyone trying to escape.
We just couldn't get over the shock of being imprisoned.
Everybody lost their homes and businesses.
Boys, why don't you take those two over there?
Take that one.
We were looked upon as traitors in our own country.
But let me tell you something.
During the entire war, there was not one single incident
of treason ever committed by Japanese-Americans!
Not a one!
So, apparently, David Toriyama is who he says he is.
He's a widower, no surviving family,
taught for 25 years in the public school system.
And yes, when he was a kid,
he was an internee at Honouliuli.
Service record?
Well, it's pretty impressive, actually.
He served in Korea and was personally cited
by Douglas MacArthur for bravery at the battle of Inchon.
Okay. Um...
what about his father?
Anything on him -- James Toriyama?
Well, here's where the information conflicts
with what David told us.
Now, camp operations was under the jurisdiction
of the Army Provost Marshal General,
but the official camp history is in
the National Archives. I was able to access it,
and I found only one reference to a James Toriyama.
He was killed by a fellow internee in May of 1943.
David, as it turns out,
your father was killed
during a fight with another internee.
Where did you learn that?
From the official record.
That might be the official record,
but it's not the truth.
So you're saying there was a cover-up?
What have I been telling you?
My father was murdered by a GI
and it was buried because he was Japanese!
Yeah, Danny.
I got a hit on Ezra Clark.
Pulled up a juvenile record.
Apparently, this guy had
a permanent spot on Santa's naughty list.
All right, give me the highlights.
Okay. He was considered a troubled youth
with years of repeat offenses
and a tendency toward violent behavior.
Last case he caught, he got into a beef,
broke a bottle over a kid's face,
cut him up pretty good. Judge labeled him high risk.
Gave him two choices: the army or jail.
Looks like he might get the chance to experience both.
Leave! Before I call the cops!
Uh, sir, we are the cops.
I never heard of Five-O.
Okay, uh, how about here--
I'll show you my badge again.
Son, are you implying i can't see or read?
No, of course not.
I'm sorry. I just figured
you'd remember us from this morning.
Well, I don't!
Mr. Clark, we just want to get some answers, that's all.
Ma'am, no offense,
but I don't care for the police,
so unless you're here for some other reason,
I suggest you get the hell out of my house!
Yeah, we will
as soon as we're done talking to you.
You were a guard at the Honouliuli Camp.
You remember a family-- the Toriyama family--
specifically, a James Toriyama?
James Tori... what? Seriously?
I can't remember what I had for breakfast,
let alone some Jap from 70 years ago.
Yeah, 'cause they all look alike, right?
That's what we called the enemy back then.
There's nothing between the lines!
Okay, well, when you say it, it sounds personal.
I'm just saying.
Listen to me.
We were at war.
Those people were our enemies!
What were "those people"" to you before the war?
Get out!
One more question:
Did you kill James Toriyama?
That's why you're here?
To accuse me of murder?
Answer the question.
Did you kill James Toriyama and steal his katana?
No. Now get out before I lose my temper!
Dad?
Are you all right?
What's going on?
It's okay, honey.
My daughter Linda.
Kinda takes the wind right out of your sails, doesn't it?
If I hated the Japanese so much,
why would I have married one?
Mr. Toriyama?
Can I help you?
Uh, just came in to see if you needed anything.
You okay?
Yeah, yeah. Thank you.
If I may, sir, I'd like to shake your hand.
You do know I was going to murder a man today.
You were a soldier.
You know guns.
I think you know your weapon wasn't going to fire.
I think you went to Pearl Harbor today to make a point,
not kill a man.
What's your name, son?
Chin Ho Kelly.
Korean?
It's in the mix.
A little Japanese as well.
In fact, I had an uncle who spent
some time at the Sand Island Camp.
You have a family, son?
Not yet.
When you do...
make sure you tell your children
what happened to us.
They must never forget.
If you need anything at all, just let me know.
Excuse me.
Thank you.
Ezra Clark give you anything?
Besides attitude?
Not much.
Well, the medications he's taking
is for treatment of Alzheimer's and dementia.
My aunt Lois is on the same pill regimen,
so it's possible, depending on what stage he's in,
he might not even really remember whether or not
he killed David's father.
It's also possible he has selective memory.
Some of those guards at those camps
weren't exactly known for their humanity.
In fact, there were plenty of cases
where internees were actually killed by them,
allegedly for resisting orders.
Hey, what are we gonna do about Mr.Toriyama?
We can't keep him here.
I still don't understand.
How come I'm not under arrest?
Who says you're not?
I'm placing you under house arrest, all right?
You're to stay here until we get to the bottom of it.
You're going to investigate my case?
Yes, I am. That's my job.
But there's one thing I need from you:
Soldier to soldier...
I need your word that you're telling me the truth.
I am.
Okay.
That's good enough for me.
Thank you.
No, don't thank me yet.
You got a picture of that stolen katana?
That's my mother.
Ah, and here's my father.
Who's this soldier?
That's my brother Kenji.
He didn't want to stay in the camp so he enlisted.
Many of the Nisei his age did the same.
He was in a unit
that was composed mostly of Japanese-Americans--
the 442nd Regimental Combat Team.
Yeah, the 442nd Purple Heart Battalion.
They were the most decorated infantry unit
in the, in the history of the United States Army.
Their motto was "Go For Broke."
Good to know you weren't sleeping
in your Annapolis class during that lesson.
What happened to Kenji?
Killed in action.
Italy.
Not a day goes by that I don't miss my brother.
Ah, here's the sword.
Beautiful.
Yes.
Brilliant piece of craftsmanship from the Koto Era.
Up until that time,
katana were regarded as evil and ugly.
But swords like this were considered
deeply spiritual, pure and benevolent.
There's, um... there's an inscription in it.
"Heaven favors the strong and the just."
Mr.Toriyama, I'd like to borrow this photograph, please.
I'd like to run it through a crime database of stolen artifacts,
see if your sword has popped up anywhere in the last 70 years.
Yes, of course.
Thanks.
Steve?
That's my grandfather.
This man right here is my grandfather.
What is he doing in your family album?
I don't know.
What's his name?
He-he looks like he was in the Navy.
His name was Steven McGarrett. He was an ensign.
And he served on the Arizona.
And he died in the attack on Pearl Harbor.
I'm sorry.
Well, I'd like to state, for the record,
that I am confused.
We got an old guy with a gun
who made a premeditated decision to kill somebody.
And we don't lock him up,
instead we, uh, we run errands for him.
This isn't a street crime.
And it's not about money.
This case is about honor.
His method, it was wrong.
I don't condone it.
But we owe it to him to,
at the very least, investigate.
Okay, I see what's happening.
You know what you're becoming, right?
Bet you're gonna tell me, aren't you?
A big softie.
I was right.
With a bleeding heart, which somehow you now have.
I mean, I don't know, maybe...
maybe you're becoming a human being, Steve.
Welcome.
So, this is where the Army stores all its old MP records.
How old is "Old"?
Well, the military's been in Hawaii
since the McKinley Era--
That's what? 120 years.
Oh, that's good. We can go find King Tut.
Please, after you.
Come on.
Uh, you know, uh, how I feel about cramped spaces like this.
I'll hold your hand, come on.
Claustrophobia is not something you make fun of, Steve, okay?
We'll hold a telethon.
Come on.
You're a jerk, you know that?
Let's go.
What is that sound? Is that rain?
It's rats.
You could've lied.
Looks like these are all tagged by year.
Looking for 1943.
Yeah, I'm in the '60s here.
'57.
Right here.
'43-- I got it.
Let's see what we got.
Nice little rat condo?
All right, January.
February...
May, here we go.
Uh, they're MP daily reports, duty logs...
What is that?
It's an S.I.R.
What's an S.I.R.?
A "Serious Incident Report."
The writing's pretty faded.
Yeah, but look right there-- it says May 24.
That's the time the old man said the murder took place.
All right, pack all this up.
Get everything back to the lab.
Everything?
Everything.
Here it is.
Type of criminal activity--
Murder by shooting.
Victim's name--
James Toriyama.
This looks like the, uh, witness report.
That's interesting.
Uh, Ezra Clark is a witness, not, uh, an offender.
All right, page three.
Where's the rest of it?
That's all there is.
What do you mean that's all there is?
There's no description of the actual events.
Maybe it ended up, uh, rat kibble.
I don't think so.
You see this jagged tear mark?
It's longer than the others and discolored along the edges.
I think it was torn off.
All right, go back to, uh, page one.
Let's see if we can work out who wrote this.
There.
George, George P...
Is that a P? It's "George P."
It's good, all we got to do is find George P.
if he's alive,
and maybe he can tell us what happened.
And if that page is just missing
or it was actually torn out deliberately.
If that's the case, david Toriyama was right.
This was a cover-up.
Yeah, Danny.
Ho, what are you doing? Where are you?
I'm at the house.
I'm just going through some of my grandfather's stuff.
Seeing if I can find a connection to David Toriyama.
And?
Nothing yet. What about you?
I reached out to the Pentagon and all the veterans organizations.
As far as I can tell,
there was no one in the Honouliuli MP
unit with the name George P.
Yeah, and I had Catherine ask David.
He said he never heard of the guy either.
The name had to come from somewhere.
Hey, you get any hits on the sword
from the stolen artifacts database?
Nothing.
Okay, so that means it could still be with the person
who stole it and then killed James Toriyama.
Right now, Ezra Clark.
Yeah, that's what David thinks.
Except, after 70 years, memories fade,
and David might not be remembering all the details.
You know what we need to do?
We need to jar his memory.
The main guard tower was here.
An American soldier sat up there
behind a 30-caliber machine gun.
Someone was watching our every move.
This is where my mother had her garden.
The ground was so sandy.
She could only grow root vegetables--
parsnips, carrots, radishes.
And this is where she collapsed
when we got the news that Kenji had been killed in Italy.
Listen.
Can you hear her cry?
I still can.
Here.
Right here.
This is the place.
This is where we lived.
David!
Nice throw, son.
David, stay here. I'll be right back.
Are you sure, David?
That Ezra Clark pulled that trigger?
I've thought about that face
every day for the last 70 years.
So David was here,
25 yards away from the tents.
And according to Ezra Clark's statement,
he was posted here, just 10 yards away.
Well, David said he responded to the sound of a gunshot, right?
He goes in, he finds his father on the floor
bleeding from a head wound.
All right, well, Ezra had the means,
he had the opportunity.
Wait a second, though.
If Ezra stole the sword, why would he stick around?
And no one, not even David, said that he had it on him.
Well, maybe he stashed it and came back and got it later.
Or maybe Ezra didn't kill James.
Maybe he was responding to the same gunshot that David heard.
He went in, got blood on himself trying to revive him.
Charlie, what do you got?
I used a forensic laser on the incident report
to bring up the missing signature.
The first name is definitely "George"
but the last name did not start with "P,"
as we originally thought.
It's an "R."
The diagonal stroke was missing.
Guy you're looking for
is an ex-cop named George Rigby.
Yeah, Dad passed away in '92.
He was with HPD for 30 years.
Moved up the ladder from beat cop to administration.
What about World War II?
Well, he was with homicide.
Even though Hawaii was under martial law,
they still needed cops,
and Dad was just too old to be drafted.
Let me help you with that.
Yeah.
Dad always wanted to be a writer.
That's why he kept all his case work.
He never got around to that novel.
If what you're looking for exists,
it's in here.
I gotta tell you, man,
this guy Rigby didn't miss a trick.
I mean, he's got notes of
every single crime scene he was ever on...
the witness descriptions...
I mean, the details are incredible.
Hold on, hold on...
What?
This is it.
All right, Ezra Clark's witness statement.
"I heard a gunshot and responded.
Saw a guy run out the back of the tent.
He wasn't one of the camp guards,
but I had seen him hanging around before."
Well, does he identify the guy?
No, not here.
All right, keep flipping pages.
I'm telling you, if Rigby was half the cop
that he seems to be,
he had to run down that lead.
Got it.
Rigby I.D.'d the guy as Joseph Archer.
He was the kid brother of Albert Archer,
who was the head guard at the camp.
All right.
That explains the missing page.
Joseph commits a murder,
and then Albert rips out the page of the incident report
to protect his little brother.
Chin, was Joseph a GI?
No, but I'm guessing he must've
paid his brother a visit at the camp,
and then used his access to rip off some internees.
What else you got on Archer?
Well, he was in and out of trouble his whole life.
Mostly petty stuff, uh... property and auto theft.
Uh, then in 1952, he graduated to the big time
and was arrested for murder.
He died in Halawa serving out a life sentence.
We need to run down that homicide report.
I'm way ahead of you.
The murder weapon was a 0.38,
and it's still in HPD custody.
All right, they never did an autopsy on David's father,
so the bullet could still be inside his body.
Chin, where was James Toriyama buried?
There's a little cemetery near the camp.
Ah, it's no more than a potter's field.
If we could find that bullet
and match it to that gun, we've got our killer.
Firing one!
It's a match.
How you doing? Five-O.
You Thomas Archer?
Yes.
Grandson of Joseph Archer?
That's right.
Uh, what can I do for you?
You ever seen this?
Sure. That's my grandpa's sword.
Do you know where it is?
May I?
Is there something wrong?
Do you have any idea how your grandfather got this sword?
Where...?
How...?
Mr. Toriyama,
Ezra Clark did not kill your father.
The man who pulled the trigger
was named Joseph Archer.
He was a career criminal who died
while serving a life sentence in the penitentiary.
On behalf of the United States Government,
we'd like to return this property to you,
its rightful owner...
And extend our most humble apologies.
David...
one more thing.
Excuse me.
Sir...
I believe I owe you an apology.
Thank you.
I remembered why your grandfather's picture
was in our family photo album.
There was this young serviceman
who used to come to our house for tutoring.
He and his wife were about to have another child
and he wanted better for them,
so he asked my father
to help him prepare for an officer aptitude test.
For three months, he would come over after dinner,
and... when he had spare time,
he'd play catch with me.
That man was your grandfather...
Steven McGarrett.
And the last time I saw him
was December 6, 1941.
The night he gave me this.
It was a gift for...
my father's help.
You have his heart.
That's how I remembered.
Mahalo.
