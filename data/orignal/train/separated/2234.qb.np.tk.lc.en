there is a town in maine ...
i &apos;d like a room .
welcome to storybrooke .
where every storybook character you &apos;ve ever known ...
is trapped between two worlds ...
an evil queen sent a bunch of fairy tale characters here .
and now they don &apos;t remember who they are .
victims of a powerful curse ...
everything you love , everything all of you love ,
will be taken from you .
only one knows the truth ,
and only one can break her spell .
it &apos;s your destiny .
you &apos;re gonna bring back the happy endings .
you enjoy your stay .
nice shot , chief .
i betcha 20 bucks you can &apos;t do it again .
next round &apos;s on him .
emma , what can i get you ?
nothing .
what the hell ?
you could have hit me .
i never miss .
you &apos;ve been avoiding me ...
since last night when you saw me .
&quot; leaving the mayor &quot; ?
and , yes , that is a euphemism .
i &apos;m not avoiding you , graham .
i just have no interest in having this conversation .
it &apos;s your life , and i really don &apos;t care .
if you don &apos;t care , then why are you so upset ?
i &apos;m not upset !
if that were true , you &apos;d be at the bar with me
having a drink and not running away .
it &apos;s none of my business , really .
can we please talk about this ? i need you to understand .
why ?
i don &apos;t know . uh , maybe so i can understand .
you need analysis , go talk to archie .
i wanna talk to you .
well , your bad judgment is your problem , not mine .
you don &apos;t know what it &apos;s like with her .
i don &apos;t feel anything . can you understand that ?
a bad relationship ? yeah . i understand a bad relationship .
i just don &apos;t wanna talk about yours .
look , i know you and regina have your own issues ,
and i should &apos;ve told you about that before you took the job .
yeah , why the secrecy ?
we &apos;re all adults . you can do whatever you want .
&apos;cause i @-@ i didn &apos;t want you to look at me the way you are now .
why do you care how i look at you ?
because ...
what ?
what the hell was that ?
did you see that ?
how much have you been drinking ?
that was way over the line .
i &apos;m sorry . i just-
what ?
you what ?
i need to feel something .
listen to me , graham .
you are drunk and full of regret . i get it .
but whatever it is you are looking to feel ,
i can tell you one thing .
you &apos;re not getting it with me .
graham .
is henry asleep ?
yes . why ?
good @-@ bye , father .
i &apos;m so sorry , snow .
i loved him so much .
so did i , dear .
so did i.
the loss i feel for my husband must be nothing compared
to the loss you feel for your father .
if there is anything i can do ,
please let me know .
i may only be your mother through marriage ,
but i &apos;m here for you , dear .
truly and forever .
congratulations .
your revenge is almost complete .
one down ...
one to go .
she has no idea , does she ?
that i &apos;m responsible for his passing ?
she sought comfort with me .
sickening .
i could have ended her miserable existence right there .
believe me , it was tempting .
it would have sated your soul .
the kingdom &apos;s still loyal to her .
they would turn on me .
they don &apos;t know the wretchedness inside her as i do .
they don &apos;t know what she did to me .
we must be delicate in this next phase .
her demise must be handled with care .
perhaps one of your knights , your majesty .
no .
i need someone adept at murder ,
bereft of mercy .
someone with no heart .
now you understand .
well , in that case ,
you need a huntsman .
you have died so that i may live .
forgive me .
your sacrifice is honorable .
i thank you .
don &apos;t worry , boy . you won &apos;t go hungry tonight .
what is it ?
i had the most intense dream .
i was ... in the woods , hunting ,
and i killed a deer . there was a wolf .
a wolf ?
its eyes--
one was blood @-@ red , and the other was black as night .
the funny thing is ...
i think i &apos;ve seen the wolf before .
go back to sleep , graham .
it was only a dream .
didn &apos;t feel like a dream .
it felt like a memory .
graham .
i need some air . i need to think .
graham , please . come back to bed .
i left my car at granny &apos;s anyway .
i need to go and get it , clear my head .
graham , listen .
it &apos;s late .
you &apos;re tired . you &apos;re probably still drunk .
don &apos;t leave .
since when do you want me to stay anyway ?
you &apos;re not well .
i &apos;m fine .
really ?
oh ! hey , wait . what are you doing ?
if graham thinks flowers will work on me ...
no , those ... were mine .
from david ?
no . uh ...
dr. whale .
why would dr. whale ...
are you serious ?
i know . it &apos;s a disaster .
no . that &apos;s amazing .
you &apos;re getting over david .
mm , first of all , there &apos;s nothing to get over ,
and second of all ,
it &apos;s just a one @-@ night stand .
not according to those flowers .
yeah , maybe i shouldn &apos;t have called him .
oh , my god . you called him ?
that is definitely not a one @-@ night stand .
well , okay , i &apos;m still learning . i ...
i &apos;ve never had one before .
i feel guilty .
why ? there &apos;s nothing wrong with what you did .
trust me . one @-@ nighters are as far as i ever go .
yeah , but that &apos;s because you &apos;re ...
because ... i &apos;m what ?
never mind .
no , tell me . what do i do ?
you &apos;re just protecting yourself ...
with that wall you put up .
just because i don &apos;t get emotional over men .
you don &apos;t get emotional over men ?
uh , the floral abuse tells a different story .
what story is that ?
the one that &apos;s obvious to everyone except , apparently , you ,
that you have feelings for graham .
come on .
there &apos;s that wall .
that &apos;s not a wall .
really ?
there &apos;s nothing wrong with being cautious .
oh , true . true .
but , emma , that wall of yours--
it may keep out pain ,
but it also may keep out love .
good morning , sheriff .
sorry if i startled you .
right .
sorry . i @-@ i thought you were a wolf .
did i forget to shave ?
what are you doing out here so early ?
a spot of gardening .
yourself ?
i was looking for a--
a wolf . yeah , i think i &apos;m beginning to catch on .
you know , to the best of my knowledge , sheriff ,
there are no wolves in storybrooke--
not the literal kind , anyway .
why are you looking ?
you &apos;ll think i &apos;m crazy .
try me .
i saw one in my dreams ,
and then i saw one for real ,
just a few hours ago .
did you , uh , did you see anything unusual out there ?
i &apos;m afraid not .
i do wish i could be more helpful .
you know , sheriff ...
they say that dreams--
dreams are memories ...
memories of another life .
uh , wh @-@ what do you believe ?
i never rule out anything .
good luck , sheriff .
i do hope you find what you &apos;re looking for .
they &apos;re letting animals in here now ?
this isn &apos;t a slaughterhouse .
forget him . he might as well be one , too .
i heard he was raised by &apos; em .
he does smell like &apos; em .
pathetic . i heard he cries over his kills .
you believe that ?
tell me , huntsman .
what kind of a man cries over an animal ?
an honorable one .
what do you know about honor ?
i have it . they have it .
you don &apos;t .
animals have it ?
they &apos;re pure of heart ,
not selfish and self @-@ serving like ... people .
you tell him to stop threatening me .
&apos;cause you know what i do to pets that threaten me ?
i hang &apos; em on my wall .
he &apos;s not a pet .
he &apos;s perfect .
bring him to me .
what do you want ?
mary margaret ?
can i talk to you ?
graham .
what &apos;s the matter ? are you okay ?
i think we , uh ...
i think we know each other .
of course we do .
no , no , no , not--not from here .
not from storybrooke .
from where , then ?
another life .
do you have a name ?
or shall i just call you &quot; the huntsman &quot; ?
you &apos;re a tortured one , aren &apos;t you , huntsman ?
is this because your parents abandoned you to the wolves ?
those weren &apos;t my parents .
all they did was give birth to me .
the wolves are my family .
wolves , indeed .
i always felt there were two kinds of people ...
wolves and sheep .
those who kill and those who get killed .
and you , huntsman ,
you are most certainly a wolf .
why am i here ?
i &apos;d like you to kill someone for me . can you do that ?
i kill for me . why would i do anything for you ?
because i have so much to offer--
a place at my court .
you will become my official huntsman .
i &apos;m not interested in being a pet .
this place is a cage .
you &apos;d be awash in luxury ,
wanting for nothing .
you have an army at your disposal .
what do you need of me ?
my prey is beloved by all the kingdom .
i need someone who won &apos;t be blinded by that--
someone without compassion .
someone ...
who will have no qualms carving a heart out
and bringing it back for my collection .
that &apos;s me .
as i suspected .
now tell me ...
what will it take , hmm ?
what do you want ?
there must be something .
outlaw the hunting of wolves .
they &apos;re to be left alone .
they are to be protected .
simple enough .
so who do you want me to kill ?
mary margaret , how long have we known each other ?
um ... i don &apos;t know . a while .
do you remember when we met ?
no .
me neither .
i can &apos;t remember when i met you or when i met anyone .
isn &apos;t that odd ?
i don &apos;t know .
i mean , i suppose .
but ... but , you know , that &apos;s just life .
things get hazy .
have i ever hurt you ?
oh , graham , no . of course not .
what is going on ?
do you believe in other lives ?
mm , like heaven ?
i mean , like past lives .
you &apos;ve been talking to henry .
henry ?
well , he has this book of stories .
he &apos;s been going on about how he thinks
we &apos;re all characters from them-- from another land ,
and we &apos;ve forgotten who we really are .
which , of course , makes no sense .
right .
no , of course .
graham .
you are burning up .
go home and get some rest .
i think you &apos;ll feel much better after you &apos;ve had some sleep .
right .
you &apos;re absolutely right .
i &apos;m sorry to disturb you .
and thank you .
of course .
you know , when i was a little girl ,
the summer palace was my favorite place .
the mountains surrounding it felt like ... a cradle .
they always made me feel safe .
i look forward to returning to it now .
stuffy in there ?
here .
no .
you &apos;re not a knight , are you ?
what makes you say that ?
without fail ,
every one of my father &apos;s men has offered me condolences ...
except you .
please accept my condolences .
and they all know how to wear armor .
she picked you to take me .
why ?
i think you know .
you &apos;re going to kill me .
you have good instincts .
and you have too much armor .
our tax dollars hard at work , i see .
graham isn &apos;t here .
i assumed he &apos;d took a sick day ... with you .
oh , so you &apos;re aware of us . good .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m here .
because i &apos;m also aware of your relationship with him .
i don &apos;t have a relationship with him .
oh ? so nothing &apos;s ever happened between the two of you ?
you forget , ms swan .
i have eyes everywhere .
nothing that meant anything .
well , of course not ,
because you &apos;re incapable of feeling anything for anyone .
there &apos;s a reason you &apos;re alone , isn &apos;t there ?
all due respect ,
the way i live my life is my business .
it is until it infringes on my life .
stay away from graham .
you may think you &apos;re doing nothing ,
but you &apos;re putting thoughts in his head--
thoughts that are not in his best interests .
you are leading him on a path to self @-@ destruction .
stay away .
hey , sheriff .
my mom &apos;s not here .
actually , uh , i &apos;m here to see you , henry .
i was hoping you could help me .
help you with what ?
it &apos;s about your book .
am i in it ?
i hunt you , yet you stop to compose a letter .
i will never understand your kind .
i don &apos;t know these woods .
you &apos;re obviously a skilled hunter .
you &apos;ll find me .
no matter what i do , i know how this ends .
yes .
there &apos;s one thing that i ask that you do
after you kill me .
please deliver this to the queen .
your tricks won &apos;t work on me .
it &apos;s not a trick .
please , give it to her .
tell her i mean every word .
sound this when you need help .
what ?
it &apos;s a whistle that will bring you aide .
you &apos;ll be led to safety . now go . run .
i don &apos;t understand . you &apos;re not going to kill me ?
run .
well , when did your flashes begin ?
right after i kissed emma .
you kissed my mom ?
what did you see ?
a wolf .
i saw that i had a knife in my hand ,
and i was with mary margaret .
were you about to hurt her ?
yes . how do you know that ?
because mary margaret ...
is snow white ,
which makes you ...
the huntsman .
so you really think that i ... could be another person ?
makes total sense . you were raised by wolves .
that &apos;s why you keep seeing one .
it &apos;s your friend , your guide .
it &apos;s trying to help you .
i &apos;m remembering this because i kissed your mother ?
how is that possible ?
well , you two do have a special connection .
she owes you her life .
why ?
snow white &apos;s her mother ,
and you spared her .
if you hadn &apos;t ...
my mom wouldn &apos;t have been born .
well , what happened after i spared snow white ?
the queen took your heart .
she ripped it out . it &apos;s kinda her thing .
she never wanted you to be able to feel again .
let me see that book .
what &apos;s that ?
i saw that , too . the wolf was howling at it .
that &apos;s her vault .
that &apos;s where she put your heart .
the wolf wants me to find it .
thank you , henry .
i hear you &apos;re having a rough day .
who says ?
pretty much everyone .
i think maybe you need to go home and get some rest .
i &apos;m fine .
no , graham , you &apos;re not fine .
you just went to see a 10 @-@ year @-@ old for help .
he &apos;s the only one making any sense .
what &apos;s going on ?
what &apos;s ... really going on ?
it &apos;s my heart , emma . i need to find it .
okay .
so ... how are you gonna do that ?
i just need to follow the wolf .
what ? what wolf ?
from my dreams .
he &apos;s gonna help me find my heart .
i &apos;m sorry . i ...
thought we were talking in a metaphor here .
you really think you don &apos;t have a heart ?
it &apos;s the only thing that makes any sense .
it &apos;s the only thing that explains
why i don &apos;t feel anything .
listen to me , graham . you have a heart .
i can prove it .
see ?
it &apos;s beating .
it &apos;s real .
feel that .
that is your heart .
no . it &apos;s the curse .
you can &apos;t really believe that &apos;s true .
what ?
graham ! graham , be careful .
he &apos;s my friend . he won &apos;t hurt us .
what is it ?
it &apos;s my heart .
it &apos;s in there .
i have to look in there .
oh , no . stop , stop .
i have to get in there . please .
graham , come on .
you really think that your heart is in there ?
okay .
let &apos;s find out .
come on !
wait here .
i see you &apos;re still in mourning .
the time for mourning is over .
i simply found that black suits me .
now tell me .
is snow dead ?
the young girl &apos;s heart , as you requested .
first , there &apos;s something i must do .
what &apos;s this ?
the girl wanted you to have it .
read it to me .
dearest stepmother ,
by the time you read this , i will be dead .
i understand that you will
never have love in your life because of me .
so it &apos;s only fitting
that i &apos;ll be denied that same joy as well .
for the sake of kingdom ,
i hope my death satisfies your need for revenge ,
allowing you to rule my father &apos;s subjects as they deserve ,
with compassion and a gentle hand .
i know what you think you &apos;re doing is vengeance .
i prefer to think of it as sacrifice ,
for the good of all .
with that in mind , i welcome the end .
i want you to take my last message to heart .
i &apos;m sorry , and i forgive you . &quot;
don &apos;t tell me you &apos;re becoming a sheep .
she put others before herself ,
and yet you hate her .
what did she do to you ?
i shared a secret with her ,
and she couldn &apos;t keep it .
and that betrayal ...
cost me dearly .
now ...
show me her heart .
it should open .
this isn &apos;t her heart .
this isn &apos;t a human heart !
what did you do ?
it &apos;s got to be in here ...
somewhere .
there &apos;s gotta be a hidden door .
a lever ...
something .
graham . hey , graham .
there &apos;s nothing in here .
there has to be . and if there isn &apos;t , then ...
it &apos;s okay .
it &apos;s going to be okay .
what the hell do you think you &apos;re doing ?
what are you doing here ?
bringing flowers to my father &apos;s grave
like i do every wednesday .
don &apos;t blame her .
it &apos;s my fault . i wanted to look in there .
really ? why ?
what were you looking for ?
nothing .
it was , uh ... it was nothing .
you don &apos;t look well , dear .
let &apos;s take you home .
no , i ... i don &apos;t want to go home .
not with you .
oh ?
but you &apos;ll go with her .
hey , this is between you two .
leave me out of it .
she &apos;s right .
it &apos;s between us , and things have to change .
and i wonder why that is all of a sudden .
it has nothing to do with her .
you know , i &apos;ve realized that
i don &apos;t feel anything , regina ,
and i know now it &apos;s not me .
it &apos;s you .
so you &apos;re leaving me for her .
i &apos;m leaving you for me .
graham , you &apos;re not thinking straight .
actually , for the first time , i am .
i &apos;d rather have nothing than settle for less .
nothing is better than what we have .
i need to feel something , regina ,
and the only way to do that is to give myself the chance .
graham .
i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s over .
i don &apos;t know what i ever did to you , ms. swan ,
to deserve this--
to have you keep coming after everything i hold dear .
i told you , it &apos;s not her .
none of this happened until she got here .
i &apos;m sorry , but have you ever stopped to think
that maybe the problem isn &apos;t with me , but with you ?
excuse me ?
henry came and found me .
graham ...
kissed me .
both were miserable .
maybe , madame mayor ,
you need to take a good , hard look in the mirror
and ask yourself why that is .
why is everyone running away from you ?
regina !
stop !
stop , stop ! aah !
not worth it .
graham .
i &apos;m sorry .
i don &apos;t know what came over me ,
how i lost my mind .
it &apos;s okay .
you were tired and feverish ...
and heartbroken .
i don &apos;t know why i let myself get caught up with her .
because it was easy and safe .
not feeling anything &apos;s an attractive option
when what you feel sucks .
felt that .
did you think you can fool me with the heart of a stag ? !
you &apos;re not going anywhere .
she doesn &apos;t deserve to die .
that &apos;s not up to you .
i wanted a heart ,
and a heart i shall have .
what are you gonna do to me ?
you &apos;re now mine .
my pet .
and this is your cage .
from this moment forward ,
you will do everything that i say ,
and if you ever disobey me ,
if you ever try to run away ,
all i have to do is squeeze .
guards !
your life is now in my hands ...
forever .
take him to my bed chamber .
all better .
yeah .
what ?
graham ?
you okay ?
i remember .
graham ?
i remember .
you remember what ?
thank you .
graham !
graham !
graham ?
graham ! graham !
graham !
graham !
graham ! come on , graham !
graham !
graham .
