it &apos;s almost over .
your son didn &apos;t even recognize you , reggie .
nobody &apos;s ever been this close
to getting this guy , lisa .
which just puts you in even more danger .
i mean , why does it have to be you ?
what , the fbi couldn &apos;t find one new york detective
that doesn &apos;t have a family ?
i want my family back .
i just need a little bit more time for us to close this case .
then i &apos;m home for good .
i &apos;m scared , reggie .

oh , no joke , brother .
kamekona no welch .

potato frittatas and spam @-@ fried rice .
okay , so everything you &apos;re going to cook for me this week ,
is it going to have spam in it ?
of course .
it &apos;s the hawaiian steak , the nectar of the islands .
do you know what &apos;s in spam ?
i &apos;ll tell you .
it &apos;s processed pork parts , salt , and meat stock .
that &apos;s what give &apos; em the glaze .
taste .
i don &apos;t want to taste .
no ?
what &apos;s the matter ?
did you see who delivered this ?
wasn &apos;t there when i came in .
somebody must &apos;ve slipped it under
the door while i was in the kitchen .
somebody send you pictures of a car wreck ?
this is the car bomb that killed my mother .
these are crime scene photographs that were stolen
from my father &apos;s toolbox a few months ago .
and now they &apos;re sending it back ?
why ?
i don &apos;t know .
i don &apos;t know .
mcgarrett .
do not approach the house . we &apos;re en route .
look out , we &apos;ve got a man down .
kevin . kev ...
who &apos;s kevin ?
my son .
okay , all right , all right .

chin .
danny , on me .
hey , get ems , okay ?
hey , this one &apos;s got a pulse .
danny .
it &apos;s okay .
hey , it &apos;s okay .
i &apos;m just going to take this blanket off your head , okay ?
i &apos;m a police officer .
my name &apos;s steve .
you must be kevin . right ?
yeah ?
kevin , i promise you no one &apos;s going to hurt you , okay ?
i need you to take my hand so we can get out of here .
keep your eyes shut there , buddy .
i &apos;m going to put you down .
okay ? okay .
you did great .
we &apos;re ok , all right ?
where &apos;s my mom and dad ?
kevin , listen to me .
i &apos;m going to get you some answers , i promise .
i want you to go with officer liko , and she &apos;s going to take really good care of you .
i &apos;m going to see you soon , okay ?
i &apos;m going to be back soon . okay ?
look , be a good boy for her .
all right ?
go ahead .
got this off our wounded man inside .
it &apos;s fbi .
fbi ?
yeah .
special agent art newman .
the vic we found in the back &apos;s also fbi .
martin stallworth .
they &apos;re both based out of new york . organized crime unit .
all right , but what about kevin &apos;s father ?
his name is reggie cole . all he had on him
was a new york driver &apos;s license . something &apos;s missing .
yeah . answers .
looks like we &apos;re about to get some .
you five @-@ o ?
yeah , i &apos;m lieutenant commander steve mcgarrett .
special agent allison marsh .
i &apos;m told reggie cole survived the attack .
yeah , he did . along with his young son .
uh , unfortunately his wife suffered
a fatal gunshot wound to the chest .
any idea who the shooters might be ?
reggie cole has been working undercover for the fbi
in jimmy cannon &apos;s new york crime family .
we &apos;re running our people now .
we have no idea how this happened .
but obviously , cannon found out reggie &apos;s identity
and sent a crew to wipe out him and his family .
i &apos;sorry . who &apos;s jimmy cannon ?
i used to be a cop in new jersey .
jimmy cannon : you used to hear his name all the time .
guns , drugs , labor ,
uh , construction , hijacking ,
anything ; you name it .
jimmy cannon was coming to oahu to visit his son richard ,
a civilian with no connection to his dad &apos;s business .
works for the preservation society here .
so reggie came in a day ahead of cannon
to set up security detail ,
but he wanted a breakaway to see his wife and son .
no one was supposed to know .
cannon obviously figured it out .
that &apos;s what i think .
all right , listen ,
if cannon finds out that reggie &apos;s not dead ,
he &apos;s gonna send men in to finish the job .
gentlemen , this is an fbi matter now ,
and the fbi will be taking over this case .
thank you for your efforts .
first of all , you &apos;re welcome .
second of all , a little boy &apos;s gonna grow up
without a mother because of a leak in your agency .
you listen to me .
you cannot go after jimmy cannon .
watch me .
reggie ? hey . i &apos;m steve mcgarrett .
where &apos;s my son ?
he &apos;s okay .
uh , your wife &apos;s parents are flying in .
you didn &apos;t answer my question .
where &apos;s my son ?
he &apos;s down the hall . we have people with him .
who , the feds ?
no . our people--
hpd .
listen , i know you don &apos;t trust anybody
after what happened .
you &apos;re right , i don &apos;t .
okay , we understand that ,
but we do have to ask you some questions .
there were two shooters . it was dark .
i didn &apos;t see their faces .
after my wife ...
after i saw my wife on the ground , i fired ,
you know , then they fired .
i hit one of them ,
and then they drove off .
are you sure you hit him ?
i hit him .
reggie , how many people knew that you and your family
were going to be in that house ?
my supervising agent .
three agents on detail .
very few people in fbi know i exist .
okay , well , one of those people had to leak
the location of your safe house .
look , my job was to get jimmy cannon .
i don &apos;t know who shot me ,
i don &apos;t know who set me up .
all i know is that jimmy cannon ordered the hit .
now , look , look , i know
you guys are trying to do your jobs ,
but jimmy cannon killed my wife .
he killed a federal agent .
you don &apos;t know who you &apos;re dealing with .
he &apos;s going to put walls up in front of you wherever you go .
we &apos;re gonna go wherever the case takes us .
and let me tell you , you want guys like us on this ,
because we &apos;ll go right through those walls .
you understand ?
i wasn &apos;t supposed to leave that house .
jimmy &apos;s gonna try again .
i got to protect my son .
i &apos;m all he has .
hey , how &apos;s reggie ?
reggie &apos;s fine .
tangential gunshot wound to the liver ,
so he &apos;s gonna need a little time .
tangential ? williams , you don &apos;t have
to bust out the big words to impress me .
that &apos;s very cute . your turn . what do you got ?
uh , i got evidence of two shooters .
two shoot ... yeah , that just confirms what reggie said ,
so i &apos;m not impressed with it .
okay , well , what if i told you i found a witness ?
would that work ?
that would blow my mind .
see that camera ?
yeah .
there are two dozen of these around the preserve
to stop illegal spear fishing .
this one &apos;s facing our crime scene .
okay , how do you know about these ?
oh , when i was in high school ,
some friends and i got suspended being filmed up here ,
allegedly drinking and night surfing . allegedly .
so , these cameras--
they use a motion detection system .
so , the tape rolls
whenever there &apos;s any movement in the field or on the road .
all right , i &apos;m gonna call the parks department
and get somebody down here now .
ah , forget that .
i got it .
what are you doing ?
spider woman , what are you doing ?
i got &apos; em on speed dial , baby .
you don &apos;t got ... would you be careful , please ?
would you stop ?
that &apos;s nice .
destruction of government property . that ...
you &apos;ve been hanging out with mcgarrett too long .
kev .
i was so worried about you .
i love you .
you know that , don &apos;t you ?
love you so much .
are you going to catch the men who hurt mommy ?
yes , i am .
so what you get off the camera ?
we got a ford explorer pulling up to the house
just before dawn , lights off .
they go into the house ...
... and they come out two minutes later .
okay , reggie said he hit one of those guys .
yeah , he did , right ...
right there .
all right , run the tape back , kono . run it back a bit .
okay , freeze it . right there .
all right , get the crime lab back to the scene
and look for any evidence around
where that explorer was , okay ?
and then check with hospitals and clinics
for any reports of gunshot wounds .
all right . i already have an apb out on the vehicle .
we &apos;re gonna need a better look at those faces in this video .
uh , it &apos;s pretty grainy , but i can try cleaning them up .
all right , when you get something ,
run &apos; em against all known members of the cannon &apos;s organization
who are actually in the database , okay ?
what about the boot print you pulled at the crime scene ?
sole treads are mass @-@ produced and sold all over the world ,
so unless we have a suspect &apos;s shoes to match them to ,
it &apos;s a dead end .
terrific
.hey. just spoke with the m.e.
the slugs he pulled out of the vics
were made of tungsten steel .
now , these are the same exact bullets
that were used in a handful of new york murders
that the feds believe ,
but can &apos;t prove , cannon ordered .
how is this guy not in jail ?
well , lack of evidence , for starters .
where are you going ?
to get some evidence .
hey , mcgarrett , williams . five @-@ 0 .
we &apos;re here to see , uh , jimmy cannon .
mr. cannon isn &apos;t seeing any visitors today .
why don &apos;t you guys go get some lunch ?
you can come back tomorrow .
thank you very much .
thank you very much ?
yeah . you heard him .
mr. cannon &apos;s not seeing any visitors .
oh , please don &apos;t do that .
what ?
put both your hands on the wheel .
every time you do that , something terrible happens ,
and i have to pray . please ?
just hang on a second .
wait ! wait !
okay .
jimmy cannon ?
who the hell are you ?
if you have to ask , your reputation is exaggerated ,
or you &apos;re slipping . i &apos;m steve mcgarrett .
this is detective danny williams .
hey , big guy , i got one of those , too .
you want to play ? we could play ,
if you want , you can walk away .
uh , it &apos;s all right . it &apos;s all right .
listen , we would have knocked ,
buit had a little trouble with the gate .
gentlemen , i get to see my son about once a year .
so , whatever this is about , make it quick .
richie , go inside .
richie , you should stay there if you want to find out
who your father really is .
don &apos;t trying to tell me who my father is ?
he &apos;s my father .
oh , that &apos;s deep . jimmy ,
hey , uh , did you really think
you were going to get away with killing a federal agent
and the wife of a new york city detective ?
what are you talking about ?
i &apos;ll tell you what he &apos;s talking about .
reggie cole was undercover
in your operation for two years .
somebody leaked that information to you ,
and you gave the order for him and his family to be killed .
a woman and a nine @-@ year @-@ old boy .
i have nothing to do with this terrible crime .
and if reggie cole is dead ,
i &apos;m sorry to hear that .
no . you see , this is in the bad news for jimmy department .
uh , reggie cole survived .
i don &apos;t keep tabs on my employees
when they &apos;re not working .
now ...
if reggie pretended to be someone he &apos;s not ,
made people love him , and then betrayed those people ,
i can understand why someone
would want to hurt the family he loves .
on the streets where i grew up on ,
some folk would consider that justice .
you know ,
i can &apos;t wait to wipe that stupid smile off your face .
i think i &apos;ll exercise my right to remain silent .
that &apos;s what guilty people do .
that &apos;s what smart people do .
well , see , if you were that smart , we never would have made it in here .
and if you had any evidence , we wouldn &apos;t be talking .
this is a photograph of a tungsten @-@ tip steel bullet .
your signature .
we found that at the cole crime scene .
now you getting sloppy , jimmy , or what ?
you know ,
every investigation ever launched against me
has come up empty . you know why ?
no . why ?
because there &apos;s nothing to find .
now , growing up in poverty and making something of yourself
used to be considered a virtue in this country .
was that capone ?
did he just quote capone ?
i think it was gotti . right , gotti ?
john gotti ? is that john gotti ?
are you two done ?
&apos;cause i &apos;d like to get back to lunch with my son .
that &apos;s fair enough .
you only see him once a year .
you know what ?
before we go , i &apos;m going to need your shoes .
let me guess .
cannon &apos;s shoes ?
yeah , and , uh , and all his bodyguards &apos; .
all right , i &apos;ll run them against the prints at the scene .
that &apos;s one of our shooters ?
yeah .
so , i contacted fbi &apos;s organized crime task force
and had them send me mug shots of every known cannon associate .
i ran them against our enhanced image ,
but no matches .
maybe reggie can id him .
hey , reggie , we need your help .
he &apos;s gone .
no one &apos;s seen reggie .
what about kevin ?
grandparents just picked him up with a protection detail right
when we got here .
all right , lock down the hospital ,
have hpd block off every access street .
nobody leaves .
what do you got ?
sir , doctor &apos;s office broken into ,
and some clothes are missing .
also got a report of a jeep cherokee stolen from the parking lot .
he &apos;s on e &amp; e.
okay , issue an apb on reggie cole and the stolen vehicle .
let &apos;s go .
okay , hold on . hold on .
he &apos;s hurt , he doesn &apos;t know the island .
how far can he get ?
he survived undercover
in one of the most violent crime families in the country , danny .
they killed his wife , okay ?
right now he &apos;s focused on protecting his son and revenge .
the question is-- where does he start ?
hold on , he &apos;s a cop .
my guess-- he starts at the crime scene .
where is he ?
he just left . took our car .
and he took something from the wall back there .
steve ?
what ?
so , he ditched the dark clothes ,
and check this out .
i think this could be a crash kit .
what is that ?
crash kit . it &apos;s like a stash box , right ?
heavy undercovers usually stow things away
in case their cover is blown ,
got to break out quick .
untraceable ids their bosses don &apos;t even know about .
cash , credit cards , and , uh ...
a clean gun .
yeah . things just keep getting better , huh ?
copy .
hpd just tried to activate the vehicle locator
on the stolen squad car . it &apos;s not working .
all right , increase the number of hpd officers
sitting on cannon &apos;s house
in case reggie decides to pay a visit .
hey , kevin .
look , i know this is hard ...
... but did you see any of these men
at your house last night ?
my dad said i &apos;m not supposed to help the police .
well ...
you know how your dad &apos;s sort of a special police officer ?
yes .
i &apos;m special police , too .
what kind of police are you ?
kevin , sometimes moms get hurt ,
and i &apos;m the kind of police they send in
to find the men that hurt moms .
and you can help me .
i think your daddy would really want you to do that .
what do you think ?
do you remember any of these men ?
no ?
it &apos;s okay , kevin .
kevin ?
i saw him .
you &apos;re sure ?
nobody else ?
thank you , kevin .
you did really good .
you did really good .
reggie cole is a highly decorated police officer .
and he knows the only reason
jimmy cannon has survived this whole time
is because he doesn &apos;t leave anybody alive
who wants to hurt him , and right now ,
reggie and his son are two people
who can hurt jimmy cannon .
all right , listen .
we know who jimmy cannon is .
all right , what we do not know
is who reggie cole is going to be
if he finds out who the leak is ,
or if tracks down one of the shooters .
oh , you were married , you have a daughter .
what would you do ?
i would like to just kill everybody ,
but i would never do that , okay ?
i would not risk going to prison . i could not do that to grace .
you-- forget it .
i don &apos;t even want to know what you would do .
i would be by the book .
the @-@ the book ?
i would be by the book .
which book would that be , may i ask ? huh ?
the patriot act for dummies ? hmm ?
how to nuke your enemies ?
war and peace ?
minus the peace part ?
it &apos;s funny .
hey , kevin give us anything ?
he saw it all go down .
he recognized our shooter from the surveillance video ,
but he couldn &apos;t id any of the fbi &apos;s known cannon associates .
then who did cannon use to pull the trigger ?
i don &apos;t know . maybe the shooters are new hires ?
nuh @-@ uh . no , no , no , no , cannon would never do that .
all right , he wouldn &apos;t expose himself like that .
he &apos;s too smart .
that &apos;s why nobody &apos;s ever been able to put him away .
any luck connecting the shoes that we brought in
with the prints we pulled off the crime scene ?
no . no matches .
think i just figured out how cannon knew where reggie was .
okay , how ?
all right , so the fbi assigned a three @-@ man detail to cole , right ?
they were agents stallworth , newman and marsh .
but there were only two of them--
agents newman and stallworth--
who were present at the time of the attack .
allison marsh , the one who briefed you ,
was absent last night due to a family emergency .
family emergency .
anybody else find that convenient ?
that &apos;s exactly what i thought .
according to her supervisor ,
she &apos;s the one who was supposed to log in any changes
to his protection detail , which she didn &apos;t .
looks like we found our leak .
look , i told you , i had a family emergency .
you &apos;re going to have to be more specific .
my daughter was sick .
you &apos;re lying . badly .
i &apos;m not lying .
how much was cannon paying you ?
you think i &apos;m the leak ?
you lost your house to foreclosure ,
which means you need the money .
you had an emergency a few hours before the shooting of a family
you were supposed to be protecting ,
and now you &apos;re lying to me . yeah , i think you &apos;re the leak .
i lost my house
because my ex @-@ husband stopped paying alimony two years ago .
okay , so you need money desperately .
i want to talk to your boss .
lady , i answer to god
and to the governor , neither of whom
are going to help you out right now , so take a seat .
okay . i lied to you .
my daughter wasn &apos;t sick yesterday .
i know that . why were you not at the safe house ?
i &apos;m in a bad custody battle ,
okay , and i was worried that my ex was going to try
to take my daughter out of the country ,
so i pulled a few strings ,
and i had him detained by the local police .
i &apos;m sorry . you framed your ex @-@ husband ?
a misdemeanor .
a misdemeanor , huh ?
it was the only way i could guarantee
that he &apos;d stay in the country .
if i hadn &apos;t done that , he &apos;d be gone today ,
and i &apos;d have lost my daughter forever .
why did you not have somebody cover you at the house ?
i just needed a couple hours .
agent newman said ,
he and stallworth could handle things while i was gone .
agent newman got shot , agent stallworth is dead .
i can get some pictures of reggie cole &apos;s wife ...
if i had known we were compromised ,
i never would have left .
people i care about have been hurt and killed .
i should have been there .
and i &apos;m going to carry that with me for the rest of my life .
hpd found the squad car reggie took .
it was abandoned in a parking lot in pearl city .
hey !
what ?
i think i might have figured out why we couldn &apos;t track this guy .
this is the vehicle locator . you see what it looks like now ?
yeah .
disabled .
okay , this is what i don &apos;t understand .
why would he steal a police car ?
okay , the car he took from the hospital was
way less conspicuous . why ?
&apos;cause he needed something .
he needed ...
you think ?
yes , i think .
i definitely think .
okay , boom , he was on this thing 20 minutes ago .
he ran a 1996 white ford explorer .
oh , that &apos;s the same car
the security cam picked up leaving the crime scene .
all right , he &apos;s got 71 potential candidates .
and then went to license photos .
yeah , see if he could find a match
to one of the shooters .
chin .
lab got a hit on the blood sample
of the gunman reggie shot .
turns out it &apos;s a local resident by the name of adin pukahi .
okay , there &apos;s a reason why we couldn &apos;t link it
to one of cannon &apos;s guys-- he did hire locally .
okay , wait a minute . that doesn &apos;t make any sense .
okay , why wouldn &apos;t cannon use his own people to make this hit ?
listen , run cole &apos;s
71 hits against a pukahi , adin .
pukahi ?
yeah , pukahi .
that &apos;s who reggie was looking for .
all right , i got a hit . adin pukahi . adress in waipahu .
anyone want to bet that &apos;s where he &apos;s going ?
here he is . the truck .
pukahi ?
get out of the vehicle right now .
well , we &apos;re going to have a very difficult time
getting him to tell us who hired him .
all right , we need to call hpd ,
and we need tell them that reggie cole is now
wanted for the murder of one of the men who killed his wife .
we got to get to the second shooter
before reggie does ,
or else we got zero chance of getting cannon .
mcgarrett .
i didn &apos;t kill him .
you hear me ? i didn &apos;t kill him .
yeah . i want to believe you , reggie .
someone else got to pukahi before i could question him .
you &apos;re asking me to trust you ,
you need to trust us .
all right , you need to turn yourself in ,
and then when we clear you , if we clear you ,
we &apos;ll work together , you understand ?
i can &apos;t do that . only have one chance left
to find out how this went down .
hold up .
reggie , you got to think about your kid right now , okay ?
who in the hell do you think i &apos;m doing this for ?
if i don &apos;t put an end to this now ,
kevin will never be safe .
hey , you can &apos;t raise your kid from a prison cell .
reggie , listen . i understand .
believe me , i understand why you &apos;re doing this ,
but you &apos;ve got to let us do our job , okay ? let us help you .
you got to trust us , reggie .
whoever gave cannon my safe house
and got my wife killed--
they were someone who i trusted .
let &apos;s just say &quot; trust &quot; isn &apos;t my thing right now .
stay out of my way , mcgarrett .
hold on .
how does he know we &apos;re here ?
how does he know we &apos;re here ?
i &apos;ll tell you how he knows we &apos;re here .
he stole the portable radio from the squad car .
right , so he could monitor our calls , track our moves .
and stay one step ahead of the investigation the whole time .
so , we need to call hpd ,
radio silence on the case right now .
hold up a second . wait a minute .
we know he &apos;s listening in on the radio , right ?
well , why go silent ?
why don &apos;t we give him something to listen to ?
all units : we have a ten @-@ five on the second cole shooter .
ala moana beach park .
suspect is armed .
proceed with caution .
standing by .
nobody moves until i give the order .
you got me ?
raise your hands and walk back toward my voice .
do it now , reggie .
yeah , we got him .
how &apos;d you know i &apos;d be here ?
this is where i &apos;d come if i thought it was gonna be a trap .
it &apos;s got the best vantage point in the park .
found this on him ; 38 caliber .
m.e. said he pulled two 38 slugs out of pukahi .
steve .
get him out of here .
i didn &apos;t kill him .
i didn &apos;t kill him !
pukahi was already dead when i got here .
you know something , reggie , i believe you .
i believe you , man .
and you know what else , i &apos;m sure that this piece ,
loaded with tungsten @-@ steel bullets
just happened to be in the car when you stole it , too , right ?
i got it out of pukahi &apos;s car , and i took it for evidence .
i didn &apos;t kill anyone .
and neither did cannon .
what are you talking about ?
jimmy cannon didn &apos;t kill my wife .
how many times do you want me to tell you ?
jimmy cannon did not kill my wife !
everything points to him .
okay ? he had the motivation ;
he had the means ; we found his signature bullets
at the crime scene , reggie .
why don &apos;t you explain that to me !
i was with jimmy cannon every day for two years .
he is a cold @-@ blooded killer , but he &apos;s not gonna trust
some low @-@ level local like pukahi
for a hit like this .
he has too much access to major talent .
somebody set him up .
and whoever set him up killed pukahi .
and that &apos;s who we need to be looking for !
instead of you in here interrogating me !
my wife &apos;s killer &apos;s still out there !
pukahi was killed with a .38 .
i pulled a .38 off of you , reggie .
what is that , coincidence ?
i didn &apos;t say i wasn &apos;t happy he was dead .
i &apos;m happy he &apos;s dead .
but i did not pull the trigger .
look , i &apos;m not gonna leave my son out here all alone
with nobody to take care of him .
i &apos;m not gonna raise my son through no prison bars .
come on , mcgarrett , do you have kids ?
no .
then you &apos;ll never understand .
ballistics report came back on pukahi .
.38 slugs don &apos;t match reggie &apos;s gun .
come on , see , i told you-- mcgarrett , please ,
we are wasting time !
all right , then who killed him ?
who killed him , huh ?
the second shooter ?
whoever hired the second shooter
was trying to silence him , can &apos;t you see that ?
just get me out of here .
i think i know how to find him .
these are the tungsten bullets
that i found on pukahi .
now , look at this .
full load , right ?
now look at this one .
see anything odd ?
it &apos;s got half the gunpowder in it .
half the power of a regular bullet .
this is a full magazine .
if you go to this much trouble to kill somebody ,
why would you use a bullet at half its force ?
hey , this one &apos;s got a pulse .
you wouldn &apos;t , unless you didn &apos;t want to kill them ,
you only wanted to wound them ,
to give them an alibi that no one would ever question .
you got it .
thank you for bringing me in on this .
reggie , thank god you &apos;re okay .
i &apos;m so sorry about lisa .
now , that looks like it hurts ,
almost as much as a gunshot wound to the collarbone .
we know you made those tungsten bullets , okay ?
i have no idea what you &apos;re talking about .
shut up .
half load , so they ...
hey , look at me !
half load , so they would wound but they wouldn &apos;t kill .
after we pulled your prints off them ,
we dumped your whole life .
you know what we found ?
$ 500,000 in a cayman islands account .
that &apos;s the price of my wife and my kid ?
reggie ! reggie ! reggie !
we know you gave away the location of the safe house .
who paid you to do that ?
let me tell you how this is gonna go , okay ?
you &apos;re gonna tell us exactly what we want to know ,
or i &apos;m gonna leave you alone in the room
with reggie for a while .
what do you think ? it &apos;s your choice .
i never met the person who paid me .
my only contact with him was over the phone .
fine . there were two shooters , all right ?
we already got pukahi ; who &apos;s the other guy ?
give me a name .
what &apos;s his name ? !
his name is nelson lee .
nelson lee ?
he &apos;s all yours .
thank you .
we need to take lee alive , you understand ?
he has to be able to i.d.
whoever hired him to kill you and your family .
there he is .
stop !
don &apos;t do it ! don &apos;t do it !
take a shot !
you &apos;re gonna die .
now , you got heaven and you got hell ,
and you got one chance to tell me the truth ,
and god can hear you .
tell me who sent you to kill me !
and i know it wasn &apos;t cannon .
tell me ! tell me who sent you to kill me !
it was his son .
jimmy cannon , show me your hands right now .
i let you into my family , and you betrayed me like this .
shut up !
i didn &apos;t kill your wife .
i know you didn &apos;t .
your son did .
what are you talking about ?
richard cannon , you &apos;re under arrest ...
tell him you had nothing to do with it .
tell him you had nothing to do with it !
say something , you son of a bitch !
... the attempted murders of reggie cole and kevin cole .
you have the right to remain silent ,
and , richard-- please do ,
because the premeditated murder of a federal agent
and a police officer &apos;s wife in front of their minor child
is special circumstances .
that &apos;s the death penalty under federal law ,
the injection , richard . you hear me ?
get him out of here .
richie ...
everyone knew the fbi was investigating you .
no one knew about me ...
till richie found an agent to take a payday .
your kid was just protecting his inheritance .
thought you were gonna lose your businesses ,
so he sent men to kill me and my family ,
planted evidence to convict you
before they could close the rico case on you .
then he started killing the same men that he hired .
you go to prison for murder , he gets to run your empire .
your own son betrayed you .
thought richie was the only good
and clean thing in your life , didn &apos;t you , jimmy ?
your time is up , jimmy .
i &apos;m gonna hunt you down like a dog .
every time you go outside , every time you hear a siren ,
every time you hear the wind blow ,
know that i &apos;m coming .
you believe i &apos;m coming .
you going back to new york ?
no , washington .
i &apos;m gonna keep my promise to lisa .
i accepted a desk job at the fbi headquarters ,
organized crime division .
i &apos;m gonna build a new case on cannon ,
come home at night , raise my son .
well , if you decide you want to raise him out here ,
let me know-- i could use a man with your skill set .
i &apos;m for that .
yeah , as long as you don &apos;t mind getting shot at ,
and never getting to drive your own car .
well , i &apos;m gonna bring down cannon first .
i may come back and take you up on that offer .
thank you .
all of you .
whatcha looking at ?
that cloud looks like a seashell , huh ?
sure does .
do you think mommy sees it ?
i know she does .
