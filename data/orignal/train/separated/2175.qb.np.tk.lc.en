easy return . ausbrook about to spike it .
and it &apos;s a punishing kill by oahu !
no one even had a hand on that !
oahu state is now one point away from championship ,
and this crowd is on their feet !
emergency , what is your problem ?
get an ambulance .
it &apos;s lieutenant kelly-- he &apos;s been shot !
please ! come quick !
he &apos;s not moving ! you &apos;ve got to hurry !
where &apos;s my father ?
they &apos;re taking him into surgery now .
is it bad ?
john , what the hell happened ?
i spoke to first @-@ on @-@ scene .
they said it was an apparent convenience store robbery .
your , uh ... your dad was off duty
when he confronted the gunman .
did we get anything from the store owner ?
not much .
he was on the floor when it all went down , but it looks like
the perp shot your dad in cold blood .
kam tong kelly is the toughest man i know .
he &apos;s gonna pull through this .
i need to see him .
for the record , can you identify
who was with you that night , lieutenant kelly ?
my senior partner john mcgarrett
and er trauma specialist malia waincroft .
and your relationship to dr. waincroft ?
we were dating at the time , but ...
she later became my wife .
i understand that your father didn &apos;t make it through surgery ,
is that correct ?
do you need a moment , lieutenant ?
no , i &apos;m fine .
let &apos;s just get this over with .
you said the identity
of the shooter was unknown to you at that time .
is that still correct ?
yes , sir .
so it wasn &apos;t until recently
that you confirmed the identity of your father &apos;s killer .
that &apos;s right . i already told you all this .
it doesn &apos;t matter .
you &apos;re being investigated for covering up a homicide .
as a matter of fact ,
you &apos;ve been investigated by internal affairs before ,
haven &apos;t you , lieutenant ?
yes .
then you know that we &apos;ve been granted oversight
and are invoking the garrity rule ,
which requires you to answer all of our questions ,
whether you think this is a waste of time or not .
is that clear ?
very .
lieutenant ,
can we talk about how the identity
of your father &apos;s murderer
became known to you ?
yeah .
uh , we caught a case five days ago .
there was a db in a warehouse on sand island .
you ever seen anything like this ?
never .
max , what &apos;d they use to torture this guy ?
uh , well , given the pinhead @-@ sized singe marks ,
i &apos;d say the implement that was used was an acetylene torch .
so the cause of death is what ?
shock . most likely from being repeatedly burned
at 6,000 degrees fahrenheit .
so he was cooked to death .
based on the physical morphology of the injuries ,
i &apos;d estimate several hours of systematic torture .
something like this-- might be cartel @-@ related .
drugs , money , murder for hire .
if that &apos;s the case , whoever ordered this
is a major player in that world .
turns out , your instinct was right .
were you able to ascertain
the name of this so @-@ called major player ?
yes . during the course of our investigation .
and for the record ,
can you identity the suspect ?
gabriel waincroft .
is this man
gabriel waincroft ?
yeah .
let the record show
lieutenant kelly identified , uh , the suspect
from case evidence photo 13 @-@ 176424 .
also for the record ,
would you state your relationship with mr. waincroft .
he &apos;s my brother @-@ in @-@ law .
i spoke to steve today .
he &apos;s thinking about becoming a navy seal .
i mean , it &apos;s kind of a relief .
i thought sure he &apos;d want to be a cop .
how &apos;s your mom doing ?
about as good as can be expected .
why don &apos;t you take a few days ?
you know ? be there for her ...
yeah , thanks , but i already offered .
moms can be stubborn like that .
yeah .
if she needs anything , don &apos;t be shy .
malia .
hi .
um , sorry to barge in on you ...
no , sit down .
have some coffee .
i wish i could .
chin , could i see you for a moment ?
yeah , sure .
ah , ah . hey . forget about it .
thanks .
i hate coming to you with this ,
especially now ,
but you know my brother .
he &apos;s a good kid .
what did he do ?
they say he stole a car .
hpd brought him in about an hour ago ,
but they haven &apos;t processed him yet .
i just spoke to him ,
and he sounds really scared .
yeah , i &apos;ll bet he is .
if they book gabriel ,
that record &apos;s going to follow him the rest of his life .
all right . all right .
i &apos;ll , uh ... i &apos;ll see what i can do .
so what did you do ?
how about i tell you what you did ?
you persuaded the complainant not to press charges ,
got a withdrawal complaint signed ,
killing the case .
gabriel was a kid .
weren &apos;t you a kid once ?
lieutenant kelly ,
gabriel waincroft was 18 years old .
that &apos;s no kid . he stole a car .
we call that grand larceny , and you ,
as a sworn officer of the law , ignored that .
you got a history of covering for family members who break the law ,
don &apos;t you , lieutenant ?
what &apos;s that supposed to mean ?
your uncle stole drug money from a police evidence locker ,
and you kept that quiet for years .
i don &apos;t see how that &apos;s relevant .
seems to be part of a pattern ,
i think that &apos;s more than relevant .
that &apos;s exactly the reason why we &apos;re here today ,
to find out what you knew and when you knew it ,
and if there was a cover @-@ up .
gabriel had never been in trouble before .
not for anything .
i figured if i could just set him straight ,
he wouldn &apos;t do anything like this again .
well , i guess you figured wrong .
what the hell were you thinking ?
i don &apos;t know .
that &apos;s not an answer .
look , i &apos;m sorry .
we were just goofing around .
goofing around .
you know you could be in jail right now ?
what , you got someplace you got to be ?
i &apos;m cool .
just &apos; cause i &apos;m in the picture doesn &apos;t mean
you have a &quot; get out of jail free &quot; card , okay ?
this is a one @-@ time thing .
the next time , you are on your own . you hear me ?
i didn &apos;t ask for your help .
no , but your sister did .
and after everything she &apos;s done for you ,
you owe it to her to keep your nose clean .
you broke her heart , gabriel .
i &apos;m sorry .
those are words , brother , just words .
you really want to make it right ?
you get a job .
you show your family
you got something to offer besides heartache .
i hear rainbow is hiring .
what , pushing loco moco to haole tourists ?
no way .
what , you got bigger plans , is that it ?
maybe .
you messed up , lieutenant .
yeah , i heard you .
by letting that kid go ,
you sent a message that he was bulletproof .
and that created a monster--
a monster that &apos;s left a trail of blood
from here to sinaloa .
what i don &apos;t get is how you could let that happen .
you were a cop ,
and yet you let that kid manipulate you from day one .
how come you couldn &apos;t see that ?
maybe you couldn &apos;t see it coming
&apos;cause you were rolling around in bed with his sister .
say something else about my wife .
take a swing or sit your ass back down .
go to hell .
hey . chin , this is what they do .
try to get under your skin .
well , it &apos;s working .
you got to take the personal out of it .
how the hell am i supposed to do that ?
there &apos;s no way not to make that personal !
chin , stop .
this is the game .
they put you to the test ,
and you &apos;re gonna pass that test ,
but you got to answer their questions ,
and you got to answer them straight ,
take all the emotion out , okay ?
what if i was wrong ?
what are you talking about ?
i was in love with malia .
maybe my judgment was clouded .
maybe i just didn &apos;t want
to believe that her brother was capable of murder !
i understand you have a db down there
by the name of amos koi .
yeah , that &apos;s right . he was burned to death .
what &apos;s dea &apos;s interest in it ?
we believe he &apos;s been working as a pilot for hire
for some pacific rim drug smugglers .
any gang in particular ?
the culiacan cartel out of sinaloa , mexico .
okay , so maybe koi wronged his bosses .
uh , he ripped them off and then paid the price .
that &apos;s certainly a viable theory , considering the cartel boss
arrived on your island three days ago .
who is he ?
i &apos;m putting up a photo now .
agent branch , are you sure this man is the boss ?
yeah , he &apos;s definitely our man .
chin , what &apos;s the matter ?
you know this guy ?
yeah , his name is gabriel waincroft .
he &apos;s malia &apos;s brother .
what &apos;s this about ?
you insult my wife again , you might as well keep it
for what i &apos;m gonna do to you .
i &apos;ll take that under advisement .
now , where were we ?
in ecclesiastes , we &apos;re told
to everything there is a season .
a time to every purpose under heaven .
time to be born .
time to die .
time to laugh .
time to weep .
this is one such time .
kam tong kelly was the best man i ever knew .
his love of life
was exceeded only by his love of family ,
which everyone here today was a member .
a life full of commendations and awards
meant nothing to him compared to the pride
that he felt when his eldest son ,
chin ho , enrolled in the police academy .
it is through him
that kam tong &apos;s legacy continues .
a legacy that embraces all of us
who were lucky enough to have known him .
attention !
excuse me .
i &apos;m so sorry .
mahalo .
i &apos;m here for you , cuz .
if there &apos;s anything you need .
win bali .
dad loved watching you surf .
uncle was a very special man .
all right , guys , let &apos;s move out .
excuse me , kono .
okay . john ? what &apos;s going on ?
the crime lab just got a case @-@ to @-@ case hit
on the gun used to kill your dad .
suspect &apos;s name is ronald palau .
he was questioned last year in a homicide .
where is he ?
pearl city .
i want to be first through the door .
whoa , chin .
i &apos;m under orders to keep you out of this .
i don &apos;t give a damn what the bosses want .
no way i &apos;m standing down .
kind of figured you &apos;d say that .
come on .
police ! get on the ground !
i said get on the ground !
show your hands !
easy , brah .
hands , you son of a bitch .
sergeant mcgarrett told you to stand down .
is that correct ?
yes .
and he was relaying a direct order from hpd command .
you were told not to participate in any aspect
of your father &apos;s murder investigation .
that &apos;s right .
but i don &apos;t know any cop
who wouldn &apos;t have done the same thing .
this was my father we &apos;re talking about .
that house that you hit--
you never found the man who murdered your father ,
did you ?
no .
ronald palau owned the gun ,
but it turns out his son sold it without telling him .
name ?
harold palau .
did you ever find the man
who bought the weapon from harold palau ?
no , harold was a meth tweaker .
he wasn &apos;t gonna give us a name .
also , it was a cash transaction .
there was nothing to trace .
we hit a dead end .
but that wasn &apos;t the end of it , was it , lieutenant ?
no , a couple weeks later , we caught a break .
found the murder weapon in a storm drain in waikiki .
managed to pull one viable print ,
crime lab ran it , and we got a hit .
hey , pig , private party !
that &apos;s my invite .
where is he ? !
you &apos;re not gonna kick that one down .
let me borrow that .
on your knees !
okay , okay !
on your knees !
don &apos;t shoot .
on your knees , now ! hands behind your back .
i &apos;m sure you &apos;ve done this before .
i got to get me one of these .
so as far as you were concerned ,
you had your killer .
well , that &apos;s what we thought .
but when we took the picture down
to the convenience store owner ,
he said that luna was not the man who murdered my father .
i understand the store owner was in the hospital
when you went for the i.d.
is that correct ?
yeah , he , uh ...
suffered a stroke after the robbery .
he had some aphasia and memory loss ,
but he was pretty adamant that luna wasn &apos;t the guy .
yet , you had teddy luna &apos;s prints on the weapon .
luna admitted to handling the weapon ,
but denied knowing anything about the murder .
did you believe him ?
doesn &apos;t matter what i believed .
we charged him with criminal possession of a weapon .
he made bail , took a plea and walked with no jail time .
you just let him go ?
we had no choice !
but without teddy luna ,
you @-@ you never would &apos;ve i.d. &apos; d your father &apos;s killer .
yeah .
luna did inadvertently provide us with a clue ,
but we were never able to get anywhere with it .
can you elaborate on that ?
okay .
so after luna was released ,
john mcgarrett and i started investigating
his known associates .
i recognize this one .
that &apos;s luna &apos;s cousin on his father &apos;s side .
he snitched for me in the past .
where can we find him ?
he used to work the door
at a gentlemen &apos;s club on kapiolani .
hey , cuz .
hey , kono .
uh , you okay ?
i &apos;ve been looking for you .
yeah , just been busy .
yeah , i see . any luck ?
yeah , we &apos;re getting there .
you can have a sip when you &apos;re 21 .
nice try , kid .
hey , who &apos;s that guy ?
him ?
small time loser named teddy luna .
hangs with a local gang .
kono , you see something ?
yeah , his tat .
um , malia &apos;s brother just got the same exact one .
gabriel ?
yeah .
are you sure ?
yeah , we were surfing rock piles yesterday , i saw it .
that &apos;s a gang tattoo .
could be gabriel was recently initiated .
question is : what did he do to earn it ?
chin , hey . what &apos;s up ?
what the hell , dude ? !
take off your rash guard !
what ?
you heard me .
how did you get that ?
what do you mean ?
you know what i mean !
what did you do to earn it ? !
nothing , man . it &apos;s just ink .
don &apos;t you lie to me !
you don &apos;t get to wear that
unless you prove yourself .
so i &apos;m gonna ask you one last time .
what did you do to earn that tattoo ?
what was his answer ?
he denied any gang involvement .
said he got the tattoo to impress a girl .
did you believe him ?
no .
you were aware at that time the description the store owner gave
to police didn &apos;t match your suspect luna .
it did , however , resemble your brother @-@ in @-@ law .
the description given to hpd was rough .
rough or not ,
the i.d. gave you reason to come down hard on gabriel .
isn &apos;t that right ?
yeah . there was no way to be sure .
so , how did you follow up ?
i took gabriel &apos;s picture
to the store owner in the hospital .
unfortunately , he passed away the night before .
oh . so you were never able to ask him
if your brother @-@ in @-@ law was the man who murdered your father ?
that &apos;s right .
and you had nothing that
would tie gabriel waincroft to the gun ?
nothing .
so , in other words , that was the end of your case ?
over the years , we followed up
on a lead or two , but nothing ever came of it .
but you always suspected
that gabriel waincroft was guilty , didn &apos;t you ?
he had an alibi , and it checked out .
and there was never any evidence
linking him directly to the crime .
deep down inside , you had to believe
he was involved , didn &apos;t you ?
ok , let &apos;s take your wife out of the equation for a moment , okay ?
i want you to think very carefully before you answer .
did you or did you not suspect
that gabriel waincroft was the man
who killed your father , kam tong kelly ?
as i said , he was thoroughly investigated .
that &apos;s not the question . you &apos;re being too cute by half .
i did my job !
quit that damn gymnastics !
answer me !
you thought gabriel waincroft killed your father ?
yes .
if gabriel murdered chin &apos;s father ,
why would chin cover that up ?
chin was in love .
love is like temporary insanity .
we do things we &apos;d normally never do ,
like , uh , disregard our sworn duty ,
or align ourselves with people who used to be our enemies .
you can understand that , can &apos;t you , officer kalakaua ?
any comment ?
turn off the video camera , i &apos;ll give you a quote .
uh , continuing on .
you said earlier chin ho
never told you he suspected
his brother @-@ in @-@ law in killing his father ?
that &apos;s right .
you two are cousins , that true ?
we are .
so you expect us to believe
that he carried around that suspicion all this time
and never mentioned it to you ?
i don &apos;t really care what you believe .
it &apos;s the truth .
officer kalakaua , you are on the record .
please remember that .
well , then let the record show that this is bull ,
because you have chin ho in the crosshairs ,
and you &apos;re gonna twist whatever i say to suit your agenda ,
so i don &apos;t even know why i &apos;m wasting my time .
officer kalakaua , let me remind you
that your immunity and means doesn &apos;t effect this proceeding .
even the governor can &apos;t help you now .
so i would suggest
you stow your attitude and sit back down .
we &apos;re not even close to being done .
please .
no , chin ho kelly , uh , never went into detail
about his father &apos;s murder .
but that &apos;s ... that &apos;s the type of man he is .
he doesn &apos;t want to burden anybody with his troubles .
but this was his father we &apos;re talking about .
of all people , commander ,
you could understand wanting closure .
what did you say ?
you heard what i said .
nice try . you &apos;re way out of line .
i &apos;m out of line ?
one of your men let a killer run free for 15 years .
suspecting and proving murder are two very different things .
now , if you two have got any evidence
that you can back up these claims you have
against chin ho kelly about him subverting the law ,
i &apos;d like to see it .
that &apos;s the point of this investigation , commander .
if there was evidence , we believe
chin ho made it disappear to protect his family .
gabriel was nowhere near as important
to chin ho as his own father .
that might have been true .
but the old man was dead ,
and there was nothing chin ho could do about that ,
except circle the wagons and protect his family .
and from everything we know about your unit ,
family comes first .
you implying that i &apos;m hiding something now ?
is that what you &apos;re saying , that this is a big cover @-@ up ?
look , we &apos;re all cops here .
we know how this works .
you have each other &apos;s backs , right ?
but something like this-- you turn your back on a murder
and letting that suspect grow into an even more dangerous sociopath--
that violates the code of silence .
you got that ?
if i knew for one second that
chin ho did what you two are saying he did ,
i would have been the first one to book him .
you know what i &apos;m going to say , don &apos;t you ?
yeah , that you want to pull me off , that i &apos;m too close .
that &apos;s s.o.p. , chin .
since when do you follow procedure ?
i trust you , chin .
you know that .
but i got to ask you this .
did you ever have any idea
what gabriel was up to this whole time ?
steve , if you trust me , you already know the answer .
so , what you &apos;re saying is , you had no idea
that you gave a free ride to the kid
who would become a ruthless cartel drug lord ?
look , all i knew was
that two years after my father died ,
gabriel told malia that he was leaving
to take a construction job on the mainland .
either you or your wife have any contact with gabriel after that ?
malia stayed in contact with him for a few years ,
but over time , it was just too hard to get ahold of him .
so you &apos;re telling us
you neither saw nor heard from him after he left
for this so @-@ called job off the island ?
yes , that &apos;s what i &apos;m telling you .
take a look at that .
tell me what it is .
looks like phone records .
be more specific .
calls from my home line .
that &apos;s right .
and as you can see ,
there were more than 20 calls to a party in the 667 area code .
where is that , lieutenant , the 667 area code ?
i have no idea .
culiacan , mexico .
maybe you want to rethink your answer .
you know , these call dates-- they &apos;re all from the time
that malia and i were living together .
that &apos;s a very convenient answer ,
and i guess lucky for you that she can &apos;t confirm it .
something you want to add to the record ,
lieutenant ?
malia knew how i felt about her brother .
if she really was in contact with him ,
she would have been smart not to tell me .
so what you &apos;re telling us is that your wife
wanted to spare you the grief of knowing
that her brother was an up @-@ and @-@ coming ,
drug @-@ dealing , murderous thug .
if she knew what gabriel was doing ,
you can be damn sure she would have told me about that
and then cut off communication with him immediately !
but she didn &apos;t , did she ?
i already told you , she never said anything !
i never saw , heard from ,
or even thought about gabriel waincroft until five days ago !
for the damn record .
duly noted .
tell us how you found gabriel , lieutenant .
once we identified the warehouse victim as amos koi ,
we went to his house .
it had been tossed ,
and his wife and kid were missing .
we later tracked them down
to a farmhouse near kualoa valley .
hey , it &apos;s okay . it &apos;s okay .
hey , hey , we &apos;re the good guys .
you all right ?
i &apos;m gonna cut these ropes .
where &apos;s your mom ?
some guy took her .
okay . where ?
do you see where we are ?
yes .
okay , good .
now , what i want you to do is real simple .
just walk into the bank like you &apos;re a normal customer ,
get my money from your husband &apos;s safety @-@ deposit box ,
and bring it back to me .
it &apos;s easy , right ?
if there &apos;s a penny less than the $ 2 million
your husband stole from me ,
i will call my friends
and your son dies , you understand ?
i understand .
i want to show you something .
you open your mouth to anyone--
the bank guards , a teller ,
even the guy you &apos;re standing behind in line ...
... and your son will look just like that .
so , according to mrs. koi ,
she went into the bank ,
took the money from the safety @-@ deposit box .
that &apos;s what we learned as well .
but before she could return it
to gabriel , he was confronted by the police .
yeah . when we got there , she was on her way out ,
but we couldn &apos;t implement a tactical plan
because gabriel made us .
gun !
gabriel !
where do you think you &apos;re going ? !
i &apos;m bleeding .
i can see that .
you gonna call an ambulance ?
what i should do is throw you off this damn roof !
and i should do the same to you
for not protecting my sister .
because of you , she &apos;s dead .
you murdered my father , you son of a bitch .
tell me why !
why ? !
wrong place , wrong time .
do it .
man up , bro ,
if you want to ride with us .
come on , mark , you jumping in or what ?
give me that .
open that register , old man , and give me the money now !
open it ! faster ! come on !
gabriel ?
what are you doing ?
i didn &apos;t have a choice .
you could have put the gun down .
and gone to jail ?
no way .
i don &apos;t do time .
well , you do now .
wait ! i got $ 25 million in an overseas bank account .
it &apos;s yours . all you got to do is just turn around and walk away .
$ 25 million !
that &apos;s more money than you &apos;ll ever see
in ten lifetimes as a cop .
what do you say , huh ?
you have the right to remain silent .
anything you say can and will be held against you .
you have the right to an attorney .
if you cannot afford an attorney ,
one will be appointed for you .
are you saying you weren &apos;t tempted to take that money ...
even a little bit ?
i &apos;m gonna pretend you never asked me that .
hey , pretend all you want ,
but that money , $ 25 million , was never recovered .
answer the question , lieutenant .
we &apos;re done .
fine .
any more questions , we &apos;ll be in touch .
lieutenant ...
what ?
you &apos;ve had quite a bit of bad luck , haven &apos;t you ?
you say you &apos;re a good cop ,
but trouble always seems to find you somehow .
you got something more you want to say to me ,
you say it , or shut the hell up .
i &apos;ll catch you later .
commander , we &apos;re ready for you .
sorry . that &apos;s mine .
i &apos;m malia .
hi .
i &apos;m chin ho kelly .
so ... what do you do , chin ho kelly ?
i &apos;m a cop .
uh , i &apos;m gonna be a cop .
i &apos;m in the academy .
i &apos;ll bet you &apos;ll look really cute in uniform .
so , can i have my board back now ?
not unless you let me take you to dinner .
you can keep it .
wait , what ?
i &apos;m sure i &apos;ll see you around .
