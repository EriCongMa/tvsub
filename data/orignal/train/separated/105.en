第六季 第一集
Alicia.
Yes?
Would you want to run for State's Attorney?
What?
Would you want to run for State's Attorney?
I...
No.
Why not?
Why not? Eli,
are you serious?
Yes, I've been watching you for the last five years.
You'd be perfect.
We need a woman,
and people respect you.
They like you...
I'm not a politician, Eli.
But you have political instincts.
And you're a brand.
You're St. Alicia.
Well, you said yourself you want something new.
The empty-nest syndrome.
Zach's gone now.
Yes, and I have another child.
Is this about Peter?
Did he tell you to ask me?
No, no.
Then, why are you doing this?
I'm never saying yes.
Because you could win.
Hello?
Yeah, it's me.
What's wrong?
Nothing. I-I think we need to talk.
We did talk.
You yelled at me. I yelled at you.
Is it Peter?
Diane called.
She wants to meet tomorrow for breakfast to talk over terms.
Great. What time?
No, I didn't say that we would meet.
She wants to bring us $38 million in business.
I don't see the downside.
Losing our culture,
co-opting ourselves
by becoming Lockhart, Florrick & Agos.
So, we'll have the breakfast,
and then we'll decide if we want to be co-opted, okay?
I'll call her, set it up.
Hey. Where are you?
Why?
'Cause I want to talk.
You did talk.
Can everyone just give me a break?
Sure, maybe you should call everyone.
Look, I made a mistake.
Things have been a bit out of control lately,
but I want to make it up, okay?
Coral Bar.
But you'd better hurry up, because I'm not waiting.
Good. I'll see you in ten.
Don't you dare turn around!
Drop the keys!
Look straight ahead!
...to the ground!
You move one inch...
...or I will put one in the back of your head!
Get your hands behind your back!
Move! Move!
Get your arm...
Don't you resist me! Don't you move!
I'll break your arm!
What do you have in your pocket?
Anything that's gonna stick me? Anything sharp?
No.
Are you sure?
Yes.
Lose the attitude.
Just a wallet.
What did I do?
Shut the hell up.
Let's go.
Yeah?
Hey! Where are you?
Uh, who is this?
Damn, Kalinda, I'm offended.
You really don't know who this is?
Sophia.
Yeah, don't sound so surprised. Where are you?
Me? Where are you?
I am finishing up a case.
I feel like celebrating.
Keep me company?
No, thank you.
Kalinda.
I'm meeting somebody.
Who?
Somebody.
A guy.
Okay.
I can take you both on. Where are you?
Good night, Sophia.
Come on! I'm lonely.
And horny.
Yeah. Good luck with that.
I was supposed to meet someone, can I just...
can I just tell them I'll be late?
Oh, sure. I'll pull right over.
Yeah, you want some ice cream?
Still want to meet up?
I think I'm gonna be sick.
Hello?
Detective?
I haven't been given my call, yet.
I know my rights. I've been here six hours,
and I haven't gotten my call.
Thank you.
Seriously?
Look, I have a Sixth Amendment right
to be informed of the charges against me.
I have the right to an attorney.
You know who has the hardest time getting arrested?
Lawyers. You know why?
Because we know our rights.
No.
You think you're at the Four Seasons.
You asked for your Sixth Amendment rights, it'll come,
just not right away. The kitchen's a little busy.
Might take a little while.
In the meantime, be patient.
We'll get to you.
This is harassment.
No, it's worse.
It's inefficiency.
Should we do this another time?
No, let's start.
I'll fill Cary in when he gets here.
I have 45 clients I intend to bring to Florrick-Agos.
I lose 12 to Lockhart/Gardner.
Won't Canning and David Lee come after the rest?
Not if I don't tell them I'm leaving.
That sounds familiar.
But I have demands first.
Kalinda.
She needs to come with me.
We have Robyn.
Kalinda's better.
It's a deal-breaker.
I have to talk to Cary.
They have a certain...
relationship that might prove difficult.
If the answer is no, then I need to know right away.
I'll let you know by the end of the day.
Good.
Here's the big one.
I expect an equal vote with Cary and you.
You can still out-vote me two-to-one,
but I bring with me prestige.
And 38 million.
I expect an equal vote.
I can't decide that on my own. It'll matter to Cary.
Like this meeting mattered to him?
Alicia,
we have a chance to make this the largest firm
in the country run by women.
Think about it.
Cary, look, if you're not interested in our future,
just let me know, okay?
And I'll start making decisions on my own.
Call me by 3:00,
or I am gathering the partners together for a vote.
I was awake.
Okay?
You were asleep,
and I heard what the charge was against you.
You did? What?
Drugs.
Okay, on your feet. Let's go.
Let's see here.
Did you guys get any breakfast?
What the hell did he just say?
What?
What the hell did he just say about where to walk?
I have no idea...
You stay to the right, jackass!
That side is for the people,
this side is for the scum. Do you understand me?
Just do what I do.
Let me see your hands.
It's kind of dark in there.
Inside.
Hands.
Walk.
Where's Cary?
Breakfast with you, I thought.
He didn't make it.
I'll try him at home.
I know you.
I didn't do anything.
This is my space.
No, no, no, no. Wait, wait, wait.
You're a Lockhart/Gardner client now.
What? No. What?
Look, do you want to make $100?
$150 cash bond, payable on release.
Let's go, let's boogie.
I hate this. Why am I doing this?
Look, he's the son of a top client.
Canning couldn't make it.
Here he comes.
David Howell.
Mail fraud, third offense.
Dear God. I can understand the second time.
But the third time, you'd think he'd catch on.
David!
How are you? I'm David Lee,
I represent your family law business, but...
I'm supposed to give you a message.
I've been asked to handle your bond hearing.
There-there's a lawyer in lockup that
It really should be a simple matter.
wants me to give you a message.
Look, only one of us can talk at a time, David!
What lawyer?
Well, wait.
Uh, it starts with a C
Uh, Craig?
Lanz.
Lanz.
Uh, no.
No. Vargas.
Uh, no. It's something.
Uh, he's a lawyer, and he's in lockup.
But he-- but he works for another firm.
Cary.
Agos?
Is that the name of the lawyer?
No, Lanz.
Cary Lanz.
Is Cary there, Alicia?
No, he's not. Why?
Is there any chance he was arrested?
ASA Polmar?
Finn, it's Alicia. I need your help.
Why? What's wrong?
There's a chance my partner is in central holding.
All right, let's go. Who's next?
Thanks for doing this, Finn.
Alicia, no problem.
But, ah, I don't think you're gonna want to thank me.
Why?
I just found out I'm the ASA.
On Cary's case?
Yeah.
Across from me?
Yeah.
Well, this should prove interesting.
Yeah.
Oh, thank God.
How did you know?
Kalinda.
Good. Okay.
It's a drug arrest.
That's all I know.
But the last time I used drugs
was the mushrooms four years ago.
Do you have enough for bail?
I pooled the partners.
I have $500 cash. First offense, no flight risk.
It shouldn't be a problem.
Cary Agos.
No matter what, I talk.
Well, I see we're enjoying a visit from a special ASA.
Is this some sort of a VIP engagement?
This is not just another routine arrest, Your Honor.
Mr. Cary Agos is accused of a Super X felony.
And is...
What?
It is a non-probationable offense
with a minimum sentence of 15 years.
My Goodness. Smack or crack?
Heroin, Your Honor.
How many grams?
900 grams.
Are-- You're kidding.
And we ask that court assign bail
in excess of $1.3 million.
...assign bail in excess of $1.3 million dollars.
I imagine you'd like bail set
at an amount lower than the ASA requested.
Yes, Your Honor.
Clearly, the State's Attorney is overreaching.
How I wish I were, Your Honor,
but, in Illinois,
bail is tied with the street value of the controlled substance.
Now, on or about May 25 of this year,
Mr. Cary Agos conspired to transport
and sell $1.3 million in...
Your Honor, Mr. Agos has a clean record.
He has major ties in the community,
and he is as far from a flight risk as it's possible to be.
And he was an ASA.
Therefore, he's subject to retribution in jail.
And yet his incentive to flee
is directly tied to the harshness of the sentencing guidelines.
I, therefore, will match bail to street value.
Your Honor, I will be filing a motion to reconsider.
When you file, I will do just that.
Bail is set at $1.3 million,
to be posted at a hundred percent.
We will reconvene for a preliminary hearing in two weeks' time.
I'll gather the partners for bail.
This has to be about Bishop.
Were you with him on May 25?
I never heard about any drug transport.
They're going after your legal advice,
trying to suggest that you told him how to break the law.
You need to get to Bishop before he hears about my arrest.
He might think I'll flip.
I'm on it!
I'm on my way to see you now, Mr. Bishop.
If you could just give me ten minutes.
Regarding?
I'd rather not say on the phone.
You know it's important, if I'm calling you like this.
I'm picking up Dylan from school.
I-I'll meet you there!
See you in ten minutes.
Hello, Florrick-Agos.
Robyn, I need you to get the partners together.
I'll be in in an hour.
Okay, is this about the Diane vote?
No.
And could you find out how much the firm can borrow?
What do you mean? Like, for maintenance?
We have a $600,000 line of credit.
No, Cary was arrested last night.
It's for his bail.
Oh, my God.
How much is bail?
I need you to keep this between us, Robyn...
We need to raise $1.3 million.
That's my call-waiting.
$1.3 mill...
Yes, and there are no bail bondsmen in Illinois,
so, we have to do this on our own. I've got to go.
This is Alicia.
Okay, I've slept on it,
and I'd like your permission to poll on your campaign.
Eli.
No, there is no campaign.
I know. That's why we have to poll.
Eli, this is not the best time. I have to go and meet...
Look, you're not obligated to act on...
Eli, I'm hanging up. No polling.
It won't cost you anyth...
I liked your old office better.
This is more like a dentist office.
We're saving money.
I thought Chicago was corrupt.
Can't you just steal more?
Don't you have something else to do today?
I told you I was fired.
From the agency?
The Juice Bar.
What are you doing now?
I'm looking out the door.
Why?
I'm surveying the troops.
Is it about the intern not wearing panties?
What?
The intern not wearing panties.
Is that why you're worried?
Which intern is not wearing panties?
Her.
Bertha? She's a grandmother.
No, behind her.
Oh, dear God. How do you know she's not wearing any panties?
I heard the guys talking.
Maybe he's telling her she has to put on panties.
Really? I have to wear panties
in the governor's office? Are you sure?
For decorum's sake, yes. If it were up to me,
you could wear what you wanted.
Don't say anything. This is not the time to be funny.
Eli, I need to talk to you.
Hello.
Hi.
This is my daughter, Marissa.
Marissa, what a pleasure.
Peter.
Nice to meet you.
I voted for you.
Absentee ballot in Israel.
She spent two years with the IDF.
That's impressive.
I'm gonna steal your dad for just a second.
You asked Alicia to run?
What?
My wife, Alicia Florrick.
You asked her to run for State's Attorney.
Jackie overheard you.
Okay, Peter. Here's the thing.
I...
No.
She's my wife.
Yeah.
And she can win.
It's not your job to be doing...
It is my job, Peter.
Why do you think I'm fighting so hard
to get a friendly face in the State's Attorney's office?
Because you have problems there.
Because someone could...
dig up old skeletons.
All right.
Find another friendly face.
It's not going to be my wife.
End of story.
Thank you for seeing me, Mr. Bishop.
I'll make this fast.
Cary Agos was arrested.
Who's he?
My partner, your other lawyer.
Oh, the kid. Right.
We wanted you to hear it from us first.
They're saying that he helped transport $1.3 million
in heroin on May 25.
We want you to know that we are handling this.
What's that mean?
We're putting together his bail,
and I'm representing him.
What's his bail?
$1.3 million.
Again, I want you to know
that attorney-client privilege covers
all his dealings with you.
Not illegal dealings.
It's my considered opinion
there were no illegal dealings.
Also, Cary would never make a deal with the State's Attorney.
Ever.
They're using him to get to me.
That's why the bail amount.
Yes.
And we're handling this.
Cary will not turn on you, Mr. Bishop.
Believe me.
Okay.
Keep me posted.
Dylan!
Over here!
If anyone has any drugs,
or anything, in any orifice,
now's the time to tell me.
Shoes held by the toes, pull out your insoles. Now!
Let's go, let's go!
Now, bang those shoes together.
Drop your shoes,
hold your arms out.
Put your palms facing the ceiling.
Do not--
I repeat, do not smudge this,
or you will have my full attention.
Cary Agos.
Let's go.
This is your new home.
This is where you will live.
I am your landlord.
Don't make me angry.
Number five.
Hey. Five minutes.
You stood me up.
Yes.
Between having a drink with you or spending a night in jail.
So, the charge said, on or about May 25th?
What happened on May 25?
You working this?
You want me working this?
Thank you.
We don't have time to gush. Okay?
What happened?
We were worried about losing clients...
Cary, lean in.
We were worried about losing clients,
so I met with Bishop to see if he was happy.
That was on May 25.
Bishop alone?
No. In his kitchen,
while I was waiting before, there were three crew members.
You remember any of their names?
No, I don't-I don't think they said their names.
They just...
One had silver teeth. Top row.
Okay.
What did you tell them?
Nothing illegal.
You know the charge says that
you told them how to elude arrest
in the next drug shipment.
I didn't.
Okay, but is there any way that
whatever you said could have been misconstrued?
Not reasonably.
Show me your arm.
C-block. 8-6-9...?
That's five.
Any advice?
Yeah.
Find a friend.
Thank you.
You're kidding, right?
You're retiring?
Yes, at the end of the month.
I want to keep the General Managership until then.
After that, you can have it.
Diane...
is retiring.
What? Why?
You're kidding.
You're forcing me out.
I'm sick of fighting.
Yes, but not so you'd retire.
Where are you going?
Nowhere.
She is retiring.
Oh. Well, I'm sorry to hear it.
Well, it's time.
I want to have a life with my new husband.
You will put in a good word for us with your clients.
Yes, as long as you don't chase them till I'm retired.
I want this to be a dignified exit.
Oh, uh... Absolutely.
You believe her?
That she's retiring?
I don't know.
Where would she go?
I thought Diane was retiring.
She is retiring-- from Lockhart/Gardner,
and coming here to us.
Wh-Why didn't she tell us? She's our lawyer.
Yes, and due to her fiduciary responsibility to Lockhart/Gardner,
she can't tell you a thing...
...including the fact that
she wants you to follow her here,
to her new home.
Would you excuse me a second?
We can't let Cary rot in prison.
Well, what about his family? I thought his parents were rich.
I called them. They're seeing what they can pull together.
I mean, it's $1.3 million.
That's a lot of money...
Robyn...
I checked with the bank, and it'll require borrowing
$200,000 against the firm,
and each partner needs to put aside their yearly draw.
Okay, that's... Oh...
Hey, guys,
this is what we do. When one of us gets in trouble,
we... we pull together.
Yeah. And Cary's not a flight risk.
The money, it comes back to us.
Yes, in two years, after the case has been settled.
And in the meantime, we go bankrupt.
And I need that draw to pay my rent.
I mean, I'm sorry, but...
I think you're being selfish.
Okay. Hey.
Let's vote.
Are you a lawyer?
Yeah.
Do you need one?
Depends on how much you charge.
I'm pretty reasonable.
What do you need?
Yeah, I was there.
You were with Cary Agos?
Bishop's lawyer?
Yeah.
This was on the 25th of May?
Around then.
That's when I was at Bishop's house.
And this lawyer, he didn't tell you anything
about how to break the law.
Is that correct?
Yeah. Pretty much.
Will you testify to that?
It's for Bishop, right?
Yeah.
Could you make a list
of the people that were there?
In Bishop's kitchen?
Sure.
Excuse me.
Kalinda.
You can't do that.
Do what, sir?
Talk to my guys.
Not without my permission.
May I have your permission?
No.
This is to help Cary Agos.
I understand that.
No.
If it helps Cary, it helps you.
Because Cary threatens me.
No.
Because Cary had a private meeting
with three members of your crew,
and suddenly he's under arrest.
Someone is collaborating with the police.
If that's true...
I'll handle it.
I'm going to say this very carefully,
so you understand.
I don't want you to pursue
this line of investigation.
Do you understand?
Yeah.
Good.
Good talking to you.
These represent our most recent numbers
on the State's Attorney race.
We focused on the top three candidates.
卡斯特罗
In a hypothetical race between the current State's Attorney,
James Castro, and the Governor's wife,
Alicia Florrick,
Mrs. Florrick would win by eight points.
Margin of error?
Three points.
How many people were sampled?
Oh, just ignore her. It's my daughter.
Just ignore me.
4,000 likely voters.
Landlines and cell phones.
Mrs. Florrick is well-liked among female voters,
liberal and conservative.
That's very unusual.
Older female voters liked that she stood by her husband;
younger, that she started her own business.
You needed me, Mr. Gold?
Actually, Nora needed to talk to you.
No, I don't.
Yes, you do.
You-you said you needed to ask Lauren a question.
Could you give us a second?
I can't ask her. It's sexual harassment.
But asking me to ask her isn't sexual harassment?
Oh, dear God.
Come on, Nora.
You can bring up panties isn't in a much more efficient
and less offensive way than I can.
Oh, really?
Why do you want to know what she's got going on under there?
Are you wearing panties?
What?
Are you wearing panties?
Some of the office workers
are saying you're not wearing panties.
Does that answer your question?
Bonita, I need you to do another poll
this one about the governor.
Personal or professional?
Personal.
Your son could stay in prison for a year, sir.
A full year, awaiting trial...
Okay.
Yes.
Thank you.
He can go as high as $8,000.
You're kidding. I thought his dad was a lobbyist.
He said it's a bad time of year.
Okay.
We have 100 from the firm.
Eight from the family.
Cary has 200 saved.
We're $975,000 away.
We're a million away.
No.
I have $15,000 in savings,
and my parents loaned me $10,000.
Robyn...
You can't.
Well, of course I can.
Cary would do the same for me.
We're still $975,000 short.
Who are you calling, Bishop?
No.
Hi, Moira. It's Alicia.
I was wondering if you had any time today.
I wanted to talk about my condo.
Possibly taking out a second mortgage.
Hey, it's only money.
Alicia?
Judge Karpman's office is calling.
You're needed in court.
That's bond court.
The judge is hearing my motion to reconsider on bail.
Moira?
I'm gonna have to call you back, Okay?
Thanks.
Here we go again.
Maybe you can raise the bail to $3 million this time.
Why didn't I think of that?
Ah, counselors.
I understand that you wish to review
the Cary Agos situation.
Is that right, ASA Polmar?
Uh, actually, Your Honor,
I made a motion to reduce the bail amount...
Yes.
And your motion was denied. Mr. Polmar?
Yes, Your Honor.
Mrs. Florrick works as Cary Agos's partner,
but she also represents Lemond Bishop,
a drug dealer complicit in this matter.
So you wish to disqualify her as his representative?
Yes, Your Honor.
Your Honor,
Cary Agos chose me as his lawyer
and has waived all concerns about conflict of interests...
Yes, but the court has not.
The prosecution's motion is granted.
Wow, I didn't see that coming.
Well, you should be honored.
I didn't want to go up against you.
Is this about your sister?
Is what about my sister?
This drug case.
Is it about your sister's overdose?
Yeah, 'cause that's what I need is a motive
to bring down the top drug dealer in town.
Cary Agos isn't the top drug dealer in town.
No, but he's enabled the top drug dealer in town.
As have I.
Is this gonna get in the way of a friendship, Alicia?
I hope not.
Good.
I don't want it to.
Neither do I.
My apologies.
Okay.
I need you to represent Cary.
He was arrested.
One of Bishop's crew is claiming
that he told them how to avoid detection on a drug shipment.
How large was the shipment?
$1.3 million in heroin.
That's not good.
Uh... wait, it's not good for Cary,
or it's not good for us?
Both.
My clients won't like to see
my new name partner under arrest.
He was arrested
because he was fighting for his client.
He puts his life on the line for them.
Okay.
She's going with Florrick-Agos.
No, too small potatoes.
Ah, it fits Diane's romantic soul.
Then there's an opportunity.
What would that be?
Cary Agos was arrested a few days ago.
A drug charge.
I, uh, I need your help, Kalinda.
Cary's been arrested.
I know.
It has to do with Bishop.
You knew that, too.
I did.
Okay, so you need to
talk to the other people in Bishop's crew,
find out who was in this meeting with Cary?
Look, Bishop doesn't want us to talk to any of his crew.
He wants us to defend Cary in another way.
Look, I have an idea,
but I'll get back to you when I have more, Okay?
Kalinda.
What?
Oh, come on, I'm just giving the boys
something to fantasize about.
What's up? What do you need me for?
Why did you call me Thursday night?
Why did I call you?
I think I made that pretty clear.
The first time in three years,
you just decide to call me?
Yeah.
At the exact moment Cary Agos was being arrested?
You're working with the police.
You knew about the arrest,
and you knew I'd get picked up, too, so you kept me occupied.
Look, I didn't want you to get swept up in all that crap.
What evidence have they got against Cary?
What evidence? Why?
Is there someone undercover in Bishop's crew?
And what makes you think even if I knew I'd tell you?
Because you could get into trouble with your P.I. firm
for warning me about the arrest.
Really?
Mm-hmm.
After I help you, keep you safe,
out of the goodness of my heart,
you're gonna use that against me?
Who's the C.I. In Bishop's crew?
Hello.
Eli.
I'm surprised. How are you?
Good. Good, Mr. State's Attorney.
I have some great news for you.
The governor has reconsidered.
He wants to endorse you.
Well, that is music to my ears.
When did that happen?
There's just one thing I need you to do for me, James.
Peter's a proud man.
You'll need to ask him again.
Why?
He can't be seen reversing himself without you making some effort.
I'm not going to kiss the ring again, Eli.
I know, you don't have to.
I'll arrange for a meeting tomorrow afternoon.
Trust me, it's just a formality.
I'll see you then.
Okay. Huh?
Your father's a smart man.
How'd your preliminary go?
Well, I told the public defender what you said.
He said he'd try it. Thanks.
Sometimes the law is nothing more than calling another man's bluff.
Well, you could help me with something else, Cary.
What?
Bishop. He wants me to cut your finger off.
I told him you were okay, I didn't need to.
You knew who your friends were.
I do.
Yeah, so that's why I'm here. To remind you.
I mean, you talk to the SA,
you ask about any kind of deal,
you're dead.
You understand?
I do, I do. I do.
Good. Now-now, I have to do this, all right?
You fell down against the bars and you cut yourself.
What?
Even to your lawyer,
that's what you say. You fell down against the bars,
you cut yourself. You're not sure how.
Just yell at guard.
What?
It's a test, all right? Bishop wants to help you,
but he needs to know you understand.
So, count to four,
and yell at guard.
I-I-I...
Guard...
Guard!
I just fell down. It's nothing serious.
You cut yourself falling down?
A... Against the bars. Yeah.
Cary, are you being intimidated?
Because we can get you transferred.
No, everything is good.
What else do you have?
Well, we want to win this in preliminary hearing,
but we don't know what the State's Attorney has.
And bail?
We're working on it.
How much does Florrick-Agos have?
A portion.
Ask my dad.
I hate asking him, but he might come up with the rest.
You already tried him?
No, no.
I'll give him a call.
Okay.
Did the dad offer anything?
$8,000.
I'll see what I can come up with.
...A thousand registered Cook County voters all considered
likely voters, Castro polled better
than your three alternates-- Jenlowe,
Hart and Barnwright.
How much better?
12 to 14 points.
Did you try any other names?
What?
Your wife, Mr. Governor.
Eli, I said no.
The poll was already in the works.
I don't care. She's not running.
You don't want to hear the results?
I can guess. She did well.
She's a brand. So what?
She polled eight points higher than Castro.
She beat him in every demographic.
We polled every political name against Castro.
And she's the only one who won.
Handedly.
And her favorables, Bonita?
They're at 80%. She's the most popular name in Chicago.
Well, because she's not in politics.
Put her in politics,
and she becomes a politician.
People hate politicians.
Bonita, would you step out for a second?
Peter, I am your chief of staff.
It is my job is to keep you from being hit
by the knowns and the unknowns.
What are the unknowns?
Your intern not wearing any panties.
You're kidding, right?
Your intern comes to work sans panties.
And lifts her dress up in the middle of work.
Well, hell, Eli, tell her not to.
It's Lauren, Peter. Your intern.
The one you won't let me fire.
I told you not to fire her.
I didn't tell you to let her run around like a cat in heat.
I have no control over someone I can't fire! Someone you're...
Look, what does this he to do with Alicia running?
I did scandal polling.
Dear God!
Using all fictitious names.
The possibility of you surviving another sexual scandal
if Alicia doesn't stand beside you.
You know what? This is sick.
What's sick is that I'm the one trying to keep Alicia on board.
Yes. Because you're not married to her.
Exactly!
Castro wants to meet.
What?
Castro wants to make another case for your endorsement.
He pleaded with me for a meeting.
If we're not having Alicia run,
you should listen to him.
Alicia, you have a few clients here...
Diane said that she'd kick in some money for Cary's bail.
We need to call her and get her...
Alicia, wait.
Bishop is here.
What? Why?
Mr. Bishop, hello.
Uh, you should've called.
Is everything all right?
Yes. Thank you.
I'm here to have a general conversation about my business holdings.
Okay. I'm-I'm not...
How can I help you with that?
Actually...
why don't I wait here while you deal
with the gentleman at your desk?
Okay.
Mr. Roja, hello.
How can I help you?
Yes. Uh, we've met before, Mrs. Florrick.
I own a string of businesses,
which includes dry cleaners and health clubs.
Yes. I know.
I... have decided to pay your partner's bail.
You decided?
1.5 mill.
That should cover the bail.
The bail is 1.3.
Okay, uh...
Okay...
1.3 million.
I would suggest that you take that
to the bank and get a cashier's check.
Excuse me.
Just so you know.
I was here to talk over my business holdings.
I had nothing to do with Mr. Roja's business.
Do we understand each other?
Yes.
Well, why don't I let you two talk?
So...
you want my endorsement?
Actually I was told
that you had had a change of heart.
So, what does this do?
Peter thinks Castro wants the meeting.
Castro thinks Peter wants the meeting.
They're both prideful and...
I want to learn your job.
No, you don't.
I think I'd be good at it.
Absolutely ridiculous!
Thanks a lot, Eli.
Everything all right, Mr. Governor?
Find out if Alicia wants to run.
Look, all I know is Diane is retiring.
We just think you should know something about Florrick-Agos.
Cary Agos was arrested on a drug charge.
What?
Florrick-Agos is an outlaw firm.
We advise you to stay with a family law firm like...
Lockhart/Gardner/Canning.
Nice offices, Kalinda.
It's very impressive.
Can I have some bottled water?
How about some ice?
How about you tell me who the C.I. Is.
I can't.
Okay.
Who is that?
Your boss.
I'm telling him you warned me off so I wouldn't be arrested.
That'd be a bitchy thing to do.
Hi. Can I speak to Mr. Redmond, please?
If you want me to help you, hang up the phone.
I can't tell you who the C.I. is.
Kalinda, you would tell Bishop.
Bishop would have him killed.
But there is a C.I.?
Your friend, Cary?
He's guilty.
He's going away for 20 years.
Guilty of what?
He told Bishop's crew
how to avoid getting arrested for the latest shipment.
That's conspiracy.
That's according to a C.I.
A C.I. who has reason to lie.
No, it's not. It's according to this.
There's a recording.
1.3 million in bail. I should frame this.
Yeah. I know. I felt the same way.
As you can see, Your Honor,
as angering as the defense has found this extortionist bail,
we have met it.
Cary Agos should be released.
Yes. That seems clear.
Unless there's anything further, ASA?
ASA Polmar?
What's he doing?
I don't know.
Your Honor, we object to these funds and we...
What? You object?
Yeah, and we ask for a Source of Funds hearing.
Your Honor, this is a delaying tactic.
We believe these funds are derived from drug sales,
Your Honor, the very charge against the defendant.
You believe? An innocent man is being held in holding.
The defendant has been charged with conspiracy to transport drugs.
We would argue that this bail money is a pay off for that action.
It is money derived from a drug dealer protecting his own.
There are so many suppositions in that argument, Your Honor,
I don't even know where to begin.
Well, why don't we begin with a Source of Funds hearing?
Excuse me! No, no!
No, no, no! Both of you,
step back behind the bar.
Behind the bar.
Given the size of this bail posting,
I will schedule a Source of Funds hearing one week from today.
In the meantime, we ask that Mr. Agos be released, Your Honor.
Mr. Agos will remain as our guest
until we can establish that these funds did not come
from the sale of drugs.
Is it from Bishop?
Not specifically.
Cary, we'll get you out soon!
Stay safe!
Stay to the right!
Keep your eyes down!
Eight bodies moving!
Hey!
Kalinda?
Hey!
What did I just tell you?
I told you to keep your eyes down!
You understand me? Do you understand me?!
I understand.
