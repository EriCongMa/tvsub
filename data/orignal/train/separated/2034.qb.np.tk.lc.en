it &apos;s not woodall coming after us , it &apos;s--
sean cahill .
your hands weren &apos;t full with eric .
they will be full with me .
what happened to , &quot; you think i &apos;m staying if you leave &quot; ?
yeah , that was before i knew
you were gonna screw over sidwell .
forstman doesn &apos;t throw money around
without getting something in return .
i have no other choice !
you two are on opposite sides of a takeover battle .
and that your girlfriend is your associate .
are you trying to say that we &apos;re colluding ?
oh , you went right there , didn &apos;t you ?
so we &apos;re just gonna go back and forth , trading favors ?
are you my lawyer or not ?
seriously , rachel ,
i couldn &apos;t have done it without you .
logan , i should go .
damn right . you get one , huntley .
eisenheim , you silly son of a bitch .
you think i &apos;d leave you out of the fun ?
riceman , after you killed the singer depo .
out of my way , johnson .
coffee &apos;s for closers . you don &apos;t get a mug .
am i to assume i &apos;m getting my own personal litt @-@ up mug ?
absolutely not .
those are mere mugs .
this , my lady , is a chalice .
okay .
it looks like all the other ones .
no , donna .
what makes this a chalice is not the mug .
it &apos;s what &apos;s inside .
wait a second . is that--
mm @-@ hmm , an exact replica of the one
dame judi dench wore as ophelia .
louis , this must have cost a fortune .
donna , please .
you helped me overcome my stage fright .
you can &apos;t put a price on that .
i don &apos;t know what to say .
that &apos;s all you have to say .
i got one for harvey too .
you know , louis , i don &apos;t think that--
i know he is still upset with me
for leading mike to forstman ,
but i just thought maybe if he could--
give it to me .
i will take care of it .
thank you , donna .
hey , mike , sidwell wants to see you .
shit .
what ?
he took forstman &apos;s money last night .
do you think he knows you &apos;re gonna cut him out of the deal ?
there &apos;s only one way to find out .
you wanted to see me ?
damn right i did .
something you want to tell me ?
jonathan , i don &apos;t know what to say .
well , you better think of something
&apos;cause i just got off the phone with some asshole from the sec
who accused you of colluding with harvey specter .
that &apos;s bullshit .
then why the hell were the two of you sharing a porterhouse
when you were supposed to be buying stock from me two nights ago ?
it &apos;s not what you think .
what i think is
you better start telling me what &apos;s going on around here .
there &apos;s nothing going on .
look , i know that guy . he &apos;s full of shit .
well , i don &apos;t know him from a hole in the ground ,
but i know that you &apos;re keeping stuff from me .
jonathan , i--
first you don &apos;t transfer forstman &apos;s money .
then you blow a straight @-@ up stock purchase
that any first @-@ year trader could do in his sleep .
it wasn &apos;t straight @-@ up .
i had to set up an auction ,
which happened to get postponed .
yeah , &apos; cause you were sipping wine
with harvey specter behind my back .
it got postponed because my girlfriend was in the hospital .
what ?
rachel passed out at school .
harvey and i went to the hospital ,
so we pushed the sale .
then you should have told me .
you &apos;re right .
i should have . i &apos;m sorry .
but that &apos;s what happened .
that &apos;s it ?
that &apos;s it .
fine .
but if there is anything else that you &apos;re not telling me ,
now is the time .
there isn &apos;t .
well ?
allison is at dinner with some friends ,
but she &apos;ll be home soon .
i have to go .
come on , we &apos;re working .
we &apos;re not working .
i am sneaking around , pretending to work
so that i can spend time with you .
sneaking around ?
that &apos;s what i &apos;d call it , wouldn &apos;t you ?
i don &apos;t know.i just don &apos;t really want to think of it like that .
i have to go .
well , she &apos;s with her friends .
aren &apos;t you allowed to be with your friends ?
is that what we are , we &apos;re friends ?
i was actually
hoping that we &apos;re more than that .
mm , we shouldn &apos;t be having this conversation .
you wouldn &apos;t be here
if you didn &apos;t want to be having this conversation .
rachel .
we have had chemistry
from the second we met .
you know it .
and i know it .
rachel . hey .
what are you doing here ?
i am here because i wanted to talk to you
before you came in to see harvey this morning .
do you want some coffee ?
no , i won &apos;t be here long enough for that .
are you sure ?
look , logan .
i know why you &apos;re here .
if you knew why i was here ,
then i wouldn &apos;t need to be here .
i think you &apos;re here to tell me that what &apos;s happening
isn &apos;t really happening , but it is .
i have a boyfriend that i love ,
so i need you to stop pursuing me .
no more flowers , no more looks ,
no more attempted kisses ,
no more anything , okay ?
look , you said that if i knew why you were here ,
you wouldn &apos;t need to be here .
i think you do need to be here ,
and we both know why .
you &apos;re wrong .
i don &apos;t think i am .
you once told me we had chemistry the second that we met .
logan , please .
tell me to stop , and i &apos;ll stop .
i can &apos;t .
rachel . rachel .
harvey , i need to--
what the hell is this ?
it &apos;s from louis . he wanted you to have it .
what do you mean he wanted me to have it ?
you haven &apos;t talked to him since mike landed forstman .
it &apos;s a gesture .
now , can i please get back to what--
oh , why didn &apos;t you say it was a gesture ?
mike has access to forstman and his $ 4 billion .
logan &apos;s on his way over to discuss our next move ,
which we can &apos;t make for two more weeks
because louis thought sheila was marrying lorenzo lamas ,
but i just got a mug with something stupid printed on it ,
so now everything &apos;s okay .
great .
are you done being a dick ?
because everything &apos;s not okay .
what did louis do now ?
nothing .
and logan sanders isn &apos;t on his way here
because he just got brought down to the s.e.c.
what the hell do you think you &apos;re doing
talking to my client without me present ?
oh , he hasn &apos;t said a word yet .
we &apos;re waiting for you to get the party started .
and what gives you the right
to bring him here in the first place ?
the united states government gives me the right ,
so if you don &apos;t mind ,
i have a few questions i would like to ask him .
you got questions for him , you ask me .
okay , here &apos;s one .
what makes you think you can get away
with collusion on my watch ?
i already told you we &apos;re not colluding ,
and you harassing my client won &apos;t change that .
will me telling him about your date
the other night with mike ross change that ?
what ?
see , i think he and mike ross are colluding to allow you
to purchase gillis industry stock at a cut rate price .
that &apos;s bullshit .
then why would you set up a private auction
while neither one of you ended up bidding ?
and logan here mysteriously bought the stock
without any competition .
that &apos;s it . we &apos;re done .
you didn &apos;t bring us in here to ask him questions .
you brought us in here to ask me questions in front of him .
am i smart enough to do that ?
you &apos;re dumb enough to try , and we &apos;re leaving .
i have not dismissed you yet .
then arrest us on the way out .
gentlemen .
hey , what &apos;s going on ?
you look upset .
no , it &apos;s nothing .
i just found out i have to go to columbia ,
so could you just tell harvey that i won &apos;t be able
to make the logan meeting ?
rachel , there is no meeting .
logan got hauled down to the s.e.c.
what ?
i just saw him this morning . that doesn &apos;t make--
well , it must have been-- wait a second .
they picked him up at his condo .
why were you at logan &apos;s condo ?
donna , please don &apos;t do your thing on me .
rachel , what is going on ?
the other night i was working with logan ,
and things got intense , and he tried to kiss me .
okay , so what did you do ?
nothing . i didn &apos;t do anything .
then why were you at his condo this morning ?
i went to tell him that i didn &apos;t want him
to get the wrong idea .
rachel , if you went to his place ,
you were giving him the wrong idea .
something happened , didn &apos;t it ?
i kissed him .
how long ?
too long .
god , i feel horrible .
i &apos;m a horrible person .
no , you &apos;re not .
you are a great person who had a not @-@ so @-@ great moment .
donna , please , you can &apos;t say a word to anyone .
of course not .
but rachel , you can &apos;t say a word to anyone either .
go ahead , say what you &apos;re gonna say .
you know what i &apos;m gonna say .
is what he said true ?
logan , i am not colluding with mike ross .
well , if i thought that ,
i wouldn &apos;t even be standing here .
i &apos;m talking about you buying that stock .
look , i can &apos;t talk about that .
why not ?
because telling you about it would make it parking ,
but that doesn &apos;t matter anymore
because now that that guy hauled you in ,
we can &apos;t do a thing with those shares anyway .
well , what can we do ?
you and mike ross can get in a room together ,
and put this thing to bed once and for all .
no , that &apos;s a bad idea .
logan , if we don &apos;t finish this now ,
you &apos;re gonna have the s.e.c.
crawling up your ass day and night .
look , you can try to scare me all you want ,
but i did nothing wrong ,
and the last guy i &apos;m getting in a room with
is mike goddamn ross .
don &apos;t you ever knock ?
logan sanders got taken downtown this morning .
sean cahill .
son of a bitch is throwing shit
at the wall to see what sticks .
and what stuck ?
wexler .
logan found out we bought that stock .
did you tell him why we kept it from him ?
he didn &apos;t seem to care .
all right .
well , it doesn &apos;t matter
because you &apos;re going to end this takeover battle now .
what do you think i &apos;ve been doing for the past month ?
harvey , i don &apos;t think you understand what i &apos;m saying .
this guy &apos;s already looking at us for collusion .
the longer this thing drags on ,
the more likely he is to come after us
for buying that stock .
in other words , end this thing ?
not in other words .
in those exact words .
so i guess jonathan didn &apos;t know you sold him out .
how &apos;d you know that ?
because if he knew ,
he &apos;d have come by your office
and ripped you to pieces .
instead , you &apos;re out here enjoying a bagel
without the courtesy of coming by to tell me that he didn &apos;t know .
my bad .
so now what are we gonna do ?
well , we &apos;re gonna kick some ass .
wait . what are you talking about ?
the s.e.c. called sidwell ,
and i guarantee you they also called logan sanders ,
which means harvey can &apos;t use those shares ,
and i &apos;m in the driver &apos;s seat .
well , that explains it .
explains what ?
harvey just called . he wants to have a meeting .
jeff .
did you hear what sean cahill did this morning ?
i did . yeah .
then you know he &apos;s poking around the wexler purchase .
ah , let him .
you don &apos;t seem very concerned .
i &apos;m not concerned because i did a damn good job
protecting this firm from any liability .
yeah , well , the question is did you protect us
from all liability ?
is there something that you want to ask me , jessica ?
i want you to go back over your work with a fine @-@ tooth comb ,
and make sure it &apos;s airtight .
jessica , you &apos;re the one who asked me to buy that stock , and
i made it questionable , like you asked ,
but if sean cahill comes at us for attempting to park it ,
that is on you , not my work .
jeff , just go back over everything like i said .
there &apos;s nothing to go back over .
we &apos;re as protected as we can be .
okay , maybe you didn &apos;t hear me .
every partner at this firm
goes over their work if i say so .
and you know what , jessica ?
i &apos;m not every goddamn partner .
so either you trust me or you don &apos;t .
hey , look what the cat dragged in .
such a serious expression .
it &apos;s because we need to have a serious conversation .
well , let &apos;s get to it .
i want you to come up with a number
that we can pay you to end this thing .
and why would i do that ?
because sean cahill hauled logan into the sec .
well , all that means is that
you can &apos;t vote the shares
that you stole from me ,
and that is a &quot; you &quot; problem .
mike , it takes two people to make a case for collusion .
so if he &apos;s coming at us , he &apos;s coming at you ,
which means it &apos;s a &quot; we &quot; problem .
yeah , you can try and spin it any way you want , but
i &apos;m happy right where i am .
i guess you agreed to this meeting
just to waste my time , huh ?
who said i don &apos;t want to deal ?
don &apos;t play me .
here &apos;s the new deal .
you don &apos;t buy me out .
i buy you out .
what ?
we tried it logan &apos;s way .
now we &apos;re gonna try it mine ...
mike .
&apos;cause the only way i &apos;d get in a room with that guy
is if you guarantee that i leave with gillis industries .
he &apos;s not gonna agree to that .
that &apos;s another &quot; you &quot; problem .
rachel ,
i need to know what &apos;s going on with logan sanders .
what ?
you spent an extra 20 hours with him last week .
it wasn &apos;t billed to the takeover ,
and i need to know what it &apos;s about .
we were looking at future deals .
&quot; we &quot; ?
yes , we .
he asked me if i could help him
put together some ideas--
why ?
what are you getting at ?
i don &apos;t know
if you &apos;ve been paying attention around here ,
but we need to wrap this thing up ,
so i need to know if whatever you and logan were up to
can force him to end this thing with mike once and for all .
it can .
how ?
logan is under pressure from his board ,
and if he doesn &apos;t close this deal soon ,
he might lose control of his company .
jessica , i must say
your impromptu lunch in the middle of the day
is exactly what the doctor ordered .
thank you , louis .
now , i must admit that
i brought you here because i have something
that i didn &apos;t want to discuss at the office .
if you &apos;re firing harvey , i can &apos;t be in on it .
i just bought him an amazing mug ,
and we &apos;re in a really good place right now .
and i &apos;m happy for you , but this isn &apos;t about harvey .
it &apos;s about the firm .
we recently purchased a large block of stock
without realizing that we represent a client
with the same interests .
you &apos;re worried about the appearance of parking the stock ?
exactly . and i just want to make sure
that we are as protected as possible .
sure , i can do it .
you seem upset .
no , i &apos;m not upset .
i mean , why would i be upset , jessica ?
you take me to an amazing restaurant ,
then you give me some bullshit story
about a stock purchase with a fabricated company ,
and when it &apos;s clear as day this is gillis industries .
louis .
the very same stock purchase
that you went to malone to structure ,
and now you want me to double check his work
because you don &apos;t trust him .
oh , question is can i trust you ?
what ?
this lunch isn &apos;t about him . it &apos;s about you .
you knew i &apos;d figure this out .
just like i know you &apos;ll figure out
whether or not we have exposure .
now , the question is can you do it
without telling jeff malone ?
i can , and i will .
if you &apos;re gonna discuss what happened ,
you can just forget it because i--
i am not here to talk about that , and you know it .
what ?
you told harvey about my problems with the board .
i told your attorney about a situation
you discussed with your other attorney .
and now he &apos;s using it to
strong @-@ arm me into caving to mike .
no , now he &apos;s using it to give you
the opportunity to impress your board .
did you bring harvey that information to get rid of me ?
logan , i didn &apos;t bring harvey that information ,
he asked me for it .
and i don &apos;t need to get rid of you
because what happened this morning
is never gonna happen again .
okay , rachel , you got what you wanted .
i &apos;m gonna get in a room with mike
and come to an agreement .
what do you mean you &apos;re gonna get in a room with him ?
well , how else did you see this happening ?
did you think i was gonna let harvey take care of it ?
look , please , you can &apos;t tell him what happened .
rachel , i would never do that .
thank you .
just to be clear , it &apos;s not for him .
it &apos;s for me ...
&apos;cause you say what happened this morning
will never happen again ,
and i &apos;m still hoping that it will .
but i don &apos;t want it to happen because you two are fighting .
i want it to happen because you want it to .
do you want me to heat some of this up or you ?
mike , i need to talk to you .
are you upset about something ?
no .
i heard you might be making a deal .
and you &apos;re worried because you &apos;re on the losing side ?
no , i &apos;m actually happy that this thing will be over .
but ?
i think that you should have
jonathan sidwell put this to bed for you .
rachel--
you and harvey have so much bad blood .
yeah , and this is our chance to patch it up .
and what about logan ?
what about him ?
i &apos;m not gonna let him get to me .
that &apos;s what you said the last time
you two got in a room together .
this is different .
mike .
rachel , stop it . look , we &apos;re at the finish line .
i &apos;m not gonna pass the baton to somebody else ,
and i &apos;m not gonna blow it
because this time i &apos;ve got all the leverage .
well , if you have all the leverage , then ...
maybe you should ask for one more thing .
you &apos;re a halfhour late .
i got stuck in traffic .
i was starting to think you didn &apos;t want this company .
harvey , i wouldn &apos;t be getting in a room
with that guy if i didn &apos;t .
good . so we &apos;re not gonna have trouble in there ?
not from me .
then let &apos;s get this thing over with
and get back to normal .
keep that in mind .
logan , sorry i &apos;m late .
let &apos;s get to it .
all right , just so we &apos;re clear ,
we &apos;re agreeing to have you buy us out .
good .
i think you &apos;ll find this more than generous .
it is .
you gonna try and spread this over 1,000 payments ?
all up front .
then all that &apos;s left is for you to pull out your checkbook .
well , actually , there is one more thing .
you said it , harvey .
let &apos;s get things back to normal .
what are you talking about ?
once this deal is done ,
you go back to being my lawyer , and he &apos;s out .
what ?
you sign that , i &apos;m harvey &apos;s client ,
and you &apos;re looking for new representation .
that &apos;s--this is bullshit .
it &apos;s not bullshit .
apple and dell don &apos;t have the same attorneys ,
and neither will you and i.
mike , you two aren &apos;t those two ,
and i can represent you both .
yeah , but it doesn &apos;t matter
because it &apos;s not about who you represent .
it &apos;s about who rachel represents .
all right , enough .
we agreed to a number .
we can work this out another time .
no , we &apos;re gonna work it out right now .
no , we &apos;re not .
then you don &apos;t have a deal .
god damn it , mike .
this isn &apos;t the time to do this .
this is exactly the time to do it
because this is the last time
i &apos;m ever gonna be in a room with him .
well , finally , something we can agree on .
then let &apos;s agree to something else .
we let harvey choose which one of us
he wants to represent after today .
mike , do not put me in that--
done .
and now that we &apos;ve agreed to let harvey decide ,
i &apos;m gonna let you in on a little secret .
the way he got me into this room
in the first place was he knows that
i &apos;ve got ten deals lined up after this .
logan .
decide .
i &apos;m going with mike .
what ?
mike &apos;s my guy .
you knew that going in .
i don &apos;t give a shit ,
and i don &apos;t think jessica pearson
is going to let you pick him over me .
jessica has nothing to do with this .
you just agreed to those terms .
those were bullshit terms .
so you &apos;re going back on your word ?
what does it look like ?
looks like there &apos;s no deal on gillis .
mike , you didn &apos;t have to blow up the deal like that .
your client blew up the deal .
because you blindsided him .
fine .
then once he &apos;s had time to think about it ,
you go back and convince him .
convince him ?
you should have come to me first
instead of looking to rub it in his face .
i wasn &apos;t rubbing anything in anyone &apos;s face .
oh , bullshit . you have leverage ,
and you want to make sure he knew it .
and when he had leverage , he made sure i knew it ,
and i didn &apos;t agree to a deal ,
and then break my word ten seconds later .
and i &apos;m giving you my word .
close this deal ,
and as soon as it &apos;s wrapped up , he &apos;s out .
and what about jessica ? is she gonna agree to it ?
let me deal with jessica .
oh , just like you did on wexler .
that was a different thing , and you know it .
do i ?
get him to agree up front ,
or we don &apos;t have a deal .
louis , i don &apos;t usually get summoned to people .
they get summoned to me .
but you wanted discretion ,
and your office is within an earshot of jeff malone .
and you don &apos;t want him to hear
what you &apos;re about to tell me .
so first off , i went through this backwards and forwards ,
and jeff did a better job than 99 % of all attorneys .
fortunately for you , i &apos;m the one .
you found a mistake .
i found a blessing in disguise .
what are you talking about ?
jessica , we &apos;re not vulnerable to allegations of parking
because we never bought those shares .
we can &apos;t sell them back .
i &apos;m not talking about selling them back .
this mistake makes the entire sale invalid .
and we don &apos;t have exposure because
the sale never happened ?
just give me the word ,
and i &apos;ll david blaine this whole thing away .
louis , this is great work ,
but i don &apos;t want you to do anything
until you talk to harvey .
are you sure ? because i can just--
louis ,
i bought these shares without telling him .
i &apos;m not getting rid of them without telling him .
are we clear ?
as a bell .
well , someone saved the day .
do tell .
jeff malone just dropped a giant deuce on jessica &apos;s desk .
please tell me you &apos;re being metaphorical .
nope . made a huge mess of the wexler purchase .
and you cleaned it up ?
even better .
because of his blunder ,
i &apos;m gonna make it as though his shitty deal never even happened .
what did jessica say ?
oh , she loved it .
and what about malone ?
that &apos;s the best part .
that asshole doesn &apos;t even know about it .
what do you need me to do to make this unwind happen ?
nothing .
jessica just wanted me to run it by harvey first ,
but i haven &apos;t been able to reach him .
able to reach him ? louis ,
what do you think is gonna happen
if malone gets wind of this
before you talk to harvey ?
ah , shit , he &apos;s gonna try to fix it himself .
and once again , he &apos;ll be taking
what &apos;s rightfully yours .
and i &apos;ll be left holding a big bag
of jeff malone &apos;s giant deuce .
where are you going ?
to do what needs to be done .
rachel , what the hell did you do ?
what are you talking about ?
mike demanded that harvey dump logan as a client ,
and it blew up the whole deal ,
and based on what i know and harvey doesn &apos;t ,
it wasn &apos;t mike behind that demand .
it was you .
i &apos;m so sorry .
sorry ?
what good does sorry do ?
donna , i thought it was the best thing
for everyone involved .
you thought it was the best way
to get logan out of the picture
and not deal with what happened .
no , i tried to deal with what happened
without telling anyone , which is what you told me to do .
i did not tell you to let your personal life
affect harvey &apos;s business .
i was just trying to get mike and harvey
back on the same team .
i want you to understand that the way to do that
isn &apos;t to pull strings behind their backs .
i do .
okay , well , there &apos;s got to be some way to fix it .
that &apos;s not the point . it &apos;s being fixed .
what are you talking about ?
harvey &apos;s going over mike &apos;s head .
he went to see charles forstman 20 minutes ago .
whoever said size doesn &apos;t matter never saw this table .
is that an insult or a compliment ?
knowing you , charles , you &apos;ll take it as both .
how &apos;d you get in here , harvey ?
you crawled in through the vents ?
i told your secretary i was george clooney &apos;s brother .
she said it was obvious who got the looks in the family .
great . do me a favor .
tell her she &apos;s fired on the way out .
can do .
but first , i wanted to show you these .
you want to give me the aston martin ?
&quot; give &quot; is a strong word .
you want me to buy you out .
you &apos;re going to buy me out .
so why come to me instead of mike ross ?
because i put him and logan sanders in a room together ,
and those two assholes let their personal shit
get in the way of business .
so what makes you think
these two assholes are gonna do any better ?
because as much as you hate my guts ,
you want this deal and that car as much as i do .
harvey , taking your car is tempting ,
but i don &apos;t think buying you out makes sense anymore .
why not ?
because you &apos;re standing there asking me to do it .
now , walk your sorry ass out of my office .
okay , charles .
but i &apos;m afraid you &apos;re forcing me to use my leverage on you .
you don &apos;t have shit on me , pal .
who do you think bought that wexler block three days ago ?
i don &apos;t give a shit who bought it three days ago .
&apos;cause it just went back on the market 30 minutes ago ,
and you &apos;re looking at the man who owns it now .
jonathan , what are you doing here ?
forstman bought the wexler shares .
what ?
they went back on the market , and he snatched them right up .
holy shit .
we win .
we do .
you did .
it &apos;s not over yet .
i want you to draw up a tender offer right away .
jonathan .
what ?
i &apos;ve been thinking about forstman .
and ?
you know we wouldn &apos;t have been able to do this without him , right ?
no shit .
just think about what else we could do with him .
you want to team up with him ?
well , you don &apos;t need to convince me ,
but how the hell are you gonna convince him ?
by giving him a discount on this deal .
how much of a discount ?
thinking somewhere in the neighborhood of ... 100 % .
god damn it , louis !
what the hell did you do ?
what are you talking about ?
i just came from a meeting with charles forstman ,
and when i reached for my bargaining chips ,
he told me i didn &apos;t own them anymore
because you unwound the wexler sale .
well , i was trying to save the firm from exposure .
and who the hell told you to do that ?
jessica did .
she told you to god damn wait ,
and you know it .
check your phone .
i tried calling you . i left three messages .
i don &apos;t care if you left me a million messages .
you were told to wait for my approval ,
and you didn &apos;t listen because you never god damn do .
you know what , harvey ? i always listen .
i always play the good soldier ,
and what do i get for it ? nothing .
i may not be a name partner , but i am a senior partner .
you get it ?
i couldn &apos;t reach you ,
and i made a goddamn judgment call .
you want to know why you &apos;re not a name partner , louis ?
because every judgment call you make turns to shit .
well , then what do you want , harvey ?
i &apos;ll do anything to make up for it .
you want to do something , louis ?
instead of using donna to give me
some stupid goddamn mug ,
stay the hell out of my business .
you mind grabbing me a couple packs of sugar there ?
i don &apos;t work here .
i &apos;m with pearson @-@ specter .
i don &apos;t give a shit who you &apos;re with .
if you &apos;re not here to give me something--
i &apos;m here to give you harvey specter on a silver platter .
i already have harvey specter on a silver platter .
not like you will if you let me buy you out .
listen , asshole , harvey came by last night ,
tried to make a deal .
i told him to shove it up his ass ,
and don &apos;t think i don &apos;t know good cop , bad cop
when i see it .
the good cop , bad cop doesn &apos;t work
when one of them hates the other one .
and what the hell is this ?
your niece &apos;s diary ?
it &apos;s a time capsule of my rage .
&quot; april 22nd , 2009 .
&quot; harvey told me to file a motion to dismiss
the odor emitting from my armpits . &quot;
this is a joke .
once again , he took my biggest fear ,
put it on display for the entire world to see .
oh , yeah , i can go on .
he hates you that bad , huh ?
no .
he doesn &apos;t give a shit about me at all .
i hate him that bad .
you know , you don &apos;t have the authority to buy me out .
i went to harvey &apos;s client behind his back ,
and i got him .
oh , i see .
i agree to this , you steal his client .
and he &apos;ll have lost to me , which is far more humiliating
than losing to you .
you &apos;d go to all this trouble to stick it to harvey ?
read may 9th , 2012 .
i &apos;d go to the ends of the goddamn earth .
i want to offer you something .
my lucky day .
everyone &apos;s bearing gifts .
you want me to buy controlling interest in the sidwell investment group .
i want you to buy it at a $ 80 million discount .
the exact amount i was gonna cut him out of .
was ? wait .
did you change your mind ?
you &apos;re not gonna cut him out of gillis ?
guess you haven &apos;t heard . i &apos;m done with gillis .
i sold my interest to logan sanders .
what the hell you talking about ?
that wasn &apos;t our deal .
what can i tell you ?
when you &apos;re the biggest bully in the yard ,
people give you their lunch money without you even asking for it .
oh , my god . you son of a bitch .
you promised me that i would control
what happened to that company .
i promised you if we won .
we didn &apos;t .
you did .
yes , i did .
then our other deal is off the table ,
and you &apos;re gonna give jonathan sidwell his goddamn cut .
how about i give you something even better .
what the hell is this ?
a job offer .
you got to be kidding me .
what , did you think i was gonna hang you out to dry ?
i could use a smart son of bitch like you working for me .
you &apos;re the last person in the world i &apos;d want to work for .
i am the only person in the world you want to work for .
why is that ?
because you &apos;re a nobody .
you &apos;re a former lawyer
who &apos;s been an investment banker all of ten minutes ,
and is about to blow the biggest deal that ever came his way ,
unless you come over to me .
go to hell .
harvey , we need to have a little talk .
i said everything i needed to say last night .
now get the hell out . i made a deal with forstman .
what ?
you stuck your nose in my goddamn business
after i told you to never do that again ?
no , i saved your goddamn business
after you told me to never do it again .
you got him to sign this ?
damn right .
and who authorized it ?
nobody .
i lied and told forstman i had logan &apos;s approval .
can we get logan &apos;s approval ?
you &apos;re goddamn right we can .
louis ,
this has got to be the most genius thing
you have ever done in your entire , wonderful ,
miserable life .
so you &apos;re not mad at me ?
mad at you ? i could kiss you .
and i can let you .
then go grab a couple of your mugs .
i &apos;ll crack open the scotch ,
and let &apos;s see where this thing goes .
can do .
hey , louis ,
how the hell did you get him to go for it ?
we found common ground .
one more thing .
charles forstman got the litt the hell up .
mike , mike , sidwell wants to see you .
don &apos;t tell me .
he knows .
shit .
you little piece of shit .
jonathan , let me explain .
there &apos;s nothing to explain .
you sold me out the second you connected with forstman .
no , i thought i could get out of it , all right ?
but then you took forstman &apos;s money , and i--
oh , you &apos;re gonna put that on me ?
i took his money because i thought we were partners .
i didn &apos;t know you were gonna stab me in the goddamn back .
stab you in the back ?
if i didn &apos;t make this deal happen ,
you said you were gonna fire me .
i don &apos;t give a shit what i said .
i took a chance on you . you spat in my face .
jonathan .
you stood right there selling me
on forstman to stop me from finding out you betrayed me .
no , i did that to stop me from having to betray you .
jonathan , he still owes us money , all right ?
we can still go after--
there isn &apos;t enough money in the world for me
to ever trust you again .
listen to me .
i &apos;m--
no , you listen to me !
there is no goddamn &quot; we . &quot;
you &apos;re fired .
jonathan , we can still talk to forstman , all right ?
you think i didn &apos;t try that ?
who the hell do you think told me
that you sold me out in the first place ?
here .
put this on your mantle .
remember me every time you god damn look at it .
there is the man of the hour .
why didn &apos;t you tell me what you were gonna do ?
because if it didn &apos;t work ,
i didn &apos;t want you to take any of the blame .
well , why didn &apos;t you tell me afterwards ?
it &apos;s all anyone can talk about .
yeah , i don &apos;t care .
louis .
forstman &apos;s insisting that i run the money
through switzerland and the caymans
before it comes out on the other side .
what ? he &apos;s trying to avoid taxes .
you &apos;re obligated to report it .
i didn &apos;t , and i &apos;m not going to .
louis , that &apos;s illegal .
you didn &apos;t see the look on harvey &apos;s face
when he found out that i was the one who saved the day ,
and i am ...
not gonna be the one
to see the look on his face when he finds out that i didn &apos;t .
louis .
leave me alone .
hey , did you hear the good news ?
there is no good news .
logan won , which means he &apos;s not going anywhere .
you want to tell mike what happened , don &apos;t you ?
i am going to tell mike what happened .
no , you &apos;re not .
harvey said he would drop logan
when this is over , and he will .
and there is no way that he &apos;s dropping logan
if mike can &apos;t even be a client .
what are you talking about ?
i just got a text from amy .
donna , mike got fired .
now you really can &apos;t tell him .
you said i shouldn &apos;t go behind his back ,
but not telling him is going behind his back .
even if you were gonna tell him ,
this is the absolute worst time .
if not now , then when ?
i mean , just wait till he recovers ,
and then smack him down again ?
how about not smacking him down at all ?
that would be great , but i already did
when i betrayed him , and i--
rachel , if you do this ,
i am telling you it will bore a hole in his brain ,
and you will be risking your whole life with mike .
i am risking it if i don &apos;t .
rachel .
donna , mike kept a secret from me
that almost ripped us apart before we even got started ,
and he found the courage to trust me with it .
so i need to find the courage to trust him with this .
