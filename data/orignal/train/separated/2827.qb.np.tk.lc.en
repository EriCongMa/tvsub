thanks for the tasty dinner .
you &apos;re welcome for a tasty dinner .
what are you guys looking at ?
ross and the most beautiful girl in the world .
yeah , come to papa !
i know !
probably the only time i &apos;ll say this ...
... but did you see the ass on her ?
what did you ... ? when did you ... ?
how did you ... ? how did you get a girl like that ?
so what is she , like a spokesmodel ? an aerobics instructor ?
actually , she &apos;s a paleontology doctoral candidate specializing in the cenozoic era .
but that &apos;s , like , the easiest era .
i &apos;ve seen her at work , but i always figured ....
but i made her dinner .
we had a great time . and we &apos;re going out again tomorrow .
maybe her friends are betting to see who gets the biggest geek .
fine by me . hope she wins .
hey , we should have a contest . yeah .
see who can bring home the most beautiful woman .
that &apos;s a good idea , joe . we could call it life .
the one with the dirty girl
you have any wrapping paper ?
is it for my birthday present ?
it was your birthday months ago .
you said you ordered something special and it just hadn &apos;t come yet .
i have a call in about that .
it &apos;s for kathy . it &apos;s an early copy of her favorite book .
the velveteen rabbit !
when the boy &apos;s love makes the rabbit real ....
don &apos;t touch it because your fingers have destructive oils .
then you &apos;d better keep it away from ross &apos; hair .
this is pretty rare . how did you get that ?
no big deal . i just went to some bookstores ...
... talked to some dealers , called some of the author &apos;s grandchildren .
honey , that &apos;s so sweet .
what a great way to say , &quot; l secretly love you , roommate &apos;s girlfriend . &quot;
it doesn &apos;t say that.does it ?
how will it look when you get her something incredibly meaningful ...
... and expensive , and her boyfriend , joey , gives her an orange ?
i &apos;ll make sure joey gets her something really great .
it &apos;s got to be better than that book .
like a crossbow !
once again , i am sorry .
thank you . bye .
i had to turn down a job catering a funeral for 60 people .
oh , my god ! what happened ?
sixty guests .
why &apos;d you have to turn it down ?
i don &apos;t have the money or equipment to handle something that big on such short notice .
i mean there &apos;s no way .
wow , what is with all the negativity ?
you sound like &quot; moni @-@ can &apos;t , &quot; not &quot; moni @-@ can &quot; !
moni @-@ ca .
you &apos;ve been playing around with this catering for over three years .
do you want to be a caterer ?
i don &apos;t know .
there you go ! that &apos;s the spirit !
if you need money , i will lend you money . just get moving !
really ? i &apos;d need $ 500 for all the food and supplies .
it &apos;s worth it if it &apos;ll get you moving . you haven &apos;t worked in months !
well , you &apos;re not working either
yes , but i &apos;m doing this .
that would be great ! thank you .

i know !
and not one of your coupons for an hour of &quot; joey love . &quot;
a crossword ! can i help ?
no .
last week i got all but three answers ...
... and i want to finish one without any help .

but you can &apos;t help me develop my new universal language .
how &apos;d it go ?

i &apos;d rather not . -oh , yeah ? why not ?
oh , yeah ? why not ?
don &apos;t take this the wrong way ...
... but your place kind of has a weird smell .
ls everything in the car ?

i hate this part .
look what we almost left !
that &apos;s not mine .
look what we almost took !
excuse me , mrs. burkart ?
well , we &apos;re all cleaned up .
good . thank you .
and , well , there &apos;s this small matter of the ....
dear ?
the matter of ... payment .
jack used to handle the finances .
you get it ?
no , but i made a widow cry .
see you in hell .
you know what we should all do ? go see a musical .
sure .
you know which one ?
the 1996 tony award winner.i mean , that one &apos;s gotta be good .
do you know the name of that one ?
i don &apos;t know . grease ?
no
rent ?
yes ! rent !
so when do you want to go ?
what ? i &apos;m sorry . i can &apos;t , i &apos;m busy .
man , it is so hard to shop for girls .
yes , it is ... at office max !
what did you get her ?
a pen .
it &apos;s two gifts in one . it &apos;s a pen that &apos;s also a clock .
you can &apos;t give her that .
why not ? because she &apos;s not 11 !
and it &apos;s not the seventh night of chanukah .
what he means by that is , while this is a very nice gift ...
... maybe it &apos;s not something a boyfriend gives .
sure it is .
she needs a pen for work .
she &apos;s writing . she turns it over .
&quot; it &apos;s time for my date with joey ! &quot;
all right . what did you get for angela del veccio &apos;s birthday ?
she didn &apos;t have one .
for three years ?
look , it &apos;s too late , and i got an audition.i can &apos;t shop anymore .
i will go out and try to find something for her .
thanks , man .
while you &apos;re at it , could you get her a card ?
would you like me to write her a little poem as well ?
or just get a card that has a poem already in it .
oh , so it &apos;s a card , but it &apos;s also a poem @-@ holder .
you have to get our money .
she couldn &apos;t stop crying .
with those thick glasses , her tears look giant .
i know , it &apos;s tough .
you know what the first thing i did after my mom &apos;s funeral was ?
what ?
pay the caterer !
i &apos;ve had a lot of jobs .
and there are some people who always try to get out of paying .
it &apos;s either &quot; that massage wasn &apos;t long enough ... &quot;
... or &quot; l don &apos;t know any of those songs ... &quot;
... or &quot; these sombreros aren &apos;t big enough . bad little white girl ! &quot;
so you think she &apos;s faking ?
there weren &apos;t any tears till you showed her the bill .
she sounded pretty upset to me .
she seems fine now .
so you just left ? her place was really that bad ?
you throw your jacket on a chair at the end of the day .
like that , only instead of a chair , it &apos;s a pile of garbage .
and instead of a jacket , it &apos;s a pile of garbage .
and instead of the end of the day , it &apos;s the end of time ...
... and garbage is all that has survived .
here .
wow . thanks .
so what happened ?
nothing . i had to get out of there .
next time , you take her to your place .
i tried that . she says it has a weird smell .
what kind of smell ?
i don &apos;t know . soap ?
listen , you like this girl , right ?
yeah .
you want to see her again ?
yeah .
so you &apos;re going to have to do it in the mess !
yeah , okay . you &apos;re right .
i mean , who cares about a little sloppiness ?
it &apos;s endearing , really .
all right !
now you go get that beautiful pig !
i just spent the entire afternoon looking for a present for kathy that would be better than the rabbit .
any luck ?
yeah , i found this great place called &quot; lnvisible things for kathy . &quot;
can you give me a hand with all this stuff ?
just return the book , let joey give her the clock pen ...
... and you get her something worse than that ...
... iike a regular pen .
she &apos;s really going to love this , you know ?
the bottom line is , i want her to have it ...
... even if i don &apos;t get to be the one who gives it to her .
honey , that &apos;s so sweet .
you don &apos;t think it &apos;s just pathetic ?
oh , &quot; pathetic &quot; !
i &apos;ve been looking all over for you .
where ?
our place . the hall .
i got something for her .
it &apos;s a book .
a book ?
is it a book that &apos;s also a safe ?
it &apos;s a book that &apos;s just a book .
it &apos;s the velveteen rabbit . it was her favorite as a kid .
so just let me know if she likes it , okay ?
you got it . thanks for doing this . i owe you one .
there wasn &apos;t any change from that twenty , was there ?
no , it came out to an even twenty .
wow . that &apos;s almost as much as a new book .
you didn &apos;t get the money ?
maybe i can try at intermission ?
you know what ? let &apos;s just go .
we &apos;re not leaving till we get paid !
i don &apos;t know who she thinks she is .
i talked to the florist . she didn &apos;t get paid either .
or the limo driver , or the priest , and he can get the dead guy damned for all eternity .
well , i &apos;m not going back out there .
fine . enough is enough !
hey , widow ?
widow ?
excuse me ? excuse me !
thanks . clearly this is a very , very hard time for you .
but we provided a service , and we deserve to be paid ...
... because you ate that service .
we are not leaving here until we are paid every penny , because ...
... we &apos;re part @-@ time caterers and we have no place else to go .
all right . i &apos;ll get my bag.good.
i &apos;m going to leave some cards here .
please think of us for your next event .

oh , god !
it &apos;s my hamster ! it &apos;s mitzi ! -oh , my god !
i &apos;m so sorry . i must have freaked out .

when joey gave it to me he said :

thanks . i love it .
i know how hard it must have been for you to find .
in case you missed that , that sound was , &quot; oh , well . &quot;
