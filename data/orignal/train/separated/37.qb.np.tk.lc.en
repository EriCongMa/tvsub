that work is ongoing ...
peter &apos;s press conference . is everything all right ?
wait . i can &apos;t hear you .
hold on .
i just need to say it .
we &apos;ve been up and down , back and forth , and i ...
will ... no .
show me the plan .
the what ?
the plan .
i get the romance .
i need a plan .
but it &apos;s unnecessary , because chicago ...
poetry &apos;s easy . it &apos;s the parent @-@ teacher conferences that are hard .
alicia , come on .
i have to go now .
come on .
i believe i am that change ,
and i believe that i am that that new beginning
thank you very much .
alicia ?
hey , thanks for doing this .
it &apos;ll be right here for you .
i &apos;m away from my phone at the moment , so please leave a message .
hey , i just wanted to say ...
you all know my wife ...
look , you &apos;re right .
i don &apos;t have a plan .
it &apos;s wrong .
i &apos;m your boss . you &apos;re my employee .
let &apos;s just ... drop this . okay ?
now that hasn &apos;t been the focus of the current state &apos;s attorney &apos;s office .
instead , s.a. glenn childs ...
i &apos;m away from my phone at the moment ,
so please leave a message .
no . you know what ? i &apos;m not just dropping this .
you want to know my plan ?
my plan is , i love you , okay ?
i &apos;ve probably loved you ... ever since georgetown .
so phone me .
i &apos;ll meet you anywhere , and we will make a plan .
if none of this makes sense to you , just ignore it .
no embarrassment , nothing .
we &apos;ll just go back to where things stood .
no . you know what ?
i &apos;m not just dropping this .
you want to know my plan ?
my plan is , i love you , okay ?
so phone me .
i &apos;ll meet you anywhere .
if none of this makes sense to you , just ignore it .
cook county state &apos;s attorney will put justice before politics ,
public safety before personal vendetta .
thank you for coming out this morning .
i have a short statement i &apos;d like to read .
first , please let me apologize to my wife , friends ,
staff , and fellow coloradans
for the shadow placed over them by these accusations .
i did nothing wrong ,
but i can understand how my actions
over the last two years have been misinterpreted .
so let me say without equivocation ,
i have always been faithful to my wife .
not only ...
yeah ?
i &apos;m headed out .
the police union speech ?
yeah . did you have a chance to read it ?
it &apos;s good .
the opening story ...
not funny enough ?
cut it .
listen , this ...
it &apos;s not us , peter .
you know , i have an hour today .
i thought , uh ...
thought i &apos;d drop by court and watch you work .
oh , that &apos;s okay .
no , i really want to .
it &apos;s a status hearing .
maybe another time .
okay .
the charges and gossip now being bandied about in the press
and through anonymous blogs ...
am i boring you ?
excuse me , your honor ?
i asked if i &apos;m boring you .
i saw you check your watch ,
and i thought i might be holding you up .
no , your honor . we have a staff meeting in an hour .
i was checking to make sure i was on time , and i am .
i &apos;m so glad .
was that a smile , miss long ?
no , your honor . food in my teeth .
okay , so , i love when prosecutors
and defense attorneys come together and find agreement ,
but your client &apos;s restitution should also include court costs ,
mrs. florrick , so if you don &apos;t mind ,
you two can revise this while i handle a pretrial motion .
let me guess . he hates women ?
no . he just checks his google alerts daily .
you have more than he does .
so it looks like you &apos;re off the hook .
i &apos;m ... ?
press has a new scandal .
it &apos;s my right , your honor !
you are one day away from trial .
we have a jury .
i will not slow this process down !
it &apos;s my right to represent myself .
you are not a lawyer , sir .
yeah , and i wasn &apos;t an alaskan fisherman
till i stepped on my first trawler .
i wasn &apos;t a hacker till i broke my first code ...
this is not a game .
you are being accused of murder .
it &apos;s a murder the government committed .
the pentagon murdered my business partner and set me up for it .
why ? because we posted top secret pentagon video on our web site !
and i don &apos;t care if you don &apos;t believe me , your honor .
it &apos;s my right under the 6th and 14th amendment
to fire my attorney , represent myself .
i will not allow this court to become your personal soapbox , mr. salle .
and i won &apos;t watch this trail turned over on appeal , you understand ?
you are getting a baby @-@ sitter .
that is not open for discussion .
mrs. florrick ?
are you a member of the capital litigation bar ?
uh , excuse me , your honor ?
are you a member of the illinois capital litigation bar ?
yes .
good .
congratulations .
i &apos;m appointing you standby counselor to mr. salle .
oh , i &apos;m sorry , but i have the murphy / gomes suit going to trial next week .
who &apos;s the judge ?
judge fullerton .
good . my court takes precedence .
trial starts tomorrow at 9 : 00 .
no . your honor , i can &apos;t ! you can &apos;t do this .
actually , ma &apos;am , i can .
your honor , i just want to point out ...
don &apos;t you start !
we are going to trial on this tomorrow .
anything from you , mr. brody ?
the people are content .
of course , they are .
tommy , next case .
and his name just kept coming up . derrick bond . derrick bond .
i go to louisiana to sign up fishermen for a bp class action ,
and i find that
half of them have already been signed up by a small boutique d.c. firm .
imagine my frustration .
so i had to look up this derrick bond .
and i was surprised to find one of the most gentlemanly
young lawyers that i have ever met .
anyway , i couldn &apos;t be happier about this merger .
will and i could not be happier .
thank you , diane . thank you , will .
uh , i know that there some unfamiliar faces around ,
so please , everyone , introduce yourselves and communicate through ...
we &apos;re moving towards a paperless office .
we bring lobbyists , you bring corporate .
we bring d.c. , you bring chicago .
with our current president &apos;s ties to your city ,
we mean more together than apart .
now , let me turn things over to bachelor number 16 .
i &apos;m not going to hear the end of that , am i ?
no . never .
a few updates .
we got a continuance on bp ,
so we &apos;ll need a few of you to join us on the diocese depos .
and the murphy / gomes suit got an expedited start date ,
so we &apos;ll need that team to kick into high gear .
so let &apos;s get going .
will ?
will ?
good job .
not me , you .
it &apos;s like invasion of the body snatchers .
as long as we &apos;re the ones snatching .
how long do i have to wait before i get my season tickets back ?
a polite week .
happy days .
just so you know ,
i &apos;ll be playing this disgruntled ... the excluded partner .
well , maybe we can shake something else loose contractually .
oh , derrick , we were just talking about you .
that went well , didn &apos;t it ?
it did . it did . a good group .
very good .
will was just talking the merger .
he had a few concerns .
nothing big . just about office space . an equitable division .
an hour ago , i resigned as state &apos;s attorney of cook county .
another year , another scandal .
another woman standing by her man ...
are you kidding ?
you &apos;d rather have your husband sleep with a prostitute ? !
if the choice was that or fall in love with someone , yeah .
one &apos;s just sex .
the other &apos;s ...
miss correlli is a key member of my staff ...
what happened to your couch ?
why , hello , mr. gold .
it &apos;s gone . redecorating .
i &apos;m taking this very personally .
oh , mr. gold .
do you know what a tracker is ?
do i know what a tracker is ?
no .
an unpaid political operative who tracks the opposition candidate ,
trying to catch him off @-@ guard with a question or a comment
in order to tape the embarrassing encounter
for free viral negative campaigning .
macaca ?
result of a tracker .
and i imagine this will all come around to me .
the events of this morning .
this congressional scandal .
you are back in the news .
and childs has people tracking you .
you know this ?
well , i know what i would do ,
and i just flip it to know what my opponent will do .
okay .
so , if anyone approaches you with a flip phone
or an oddly shouted comment ,
the best thing to do is smile and move on .
they will try to follow you .
probably a college student , often working in twos .
again , smile and move on .
i &apos;m trying to keep you out of this , but it &apos;s modern politics .
wives are no longer off @-@ limits .
everything good here ?
everything &apos;s good here .
anything else ?
no . i &apos;m good . if you &apos;re good .
i &apos;m good .
hey , will .
eli .
you needed something ?
yes .
judge matchick made me standby counsel on a pro se case
starting tomorrow .
you told him about the murphy / gomes date ?
i did .
he didn &apos;t seem to care .
yeah , that sounds like matchick .
he &apos;s still proud of a walk @-@ on line
he had in the dark knight .
okay , i &apos;ll have shawn take over .
i think i can do both .
no , it &apos;s okay .
we &apos;re not starved for personnel anymore .
merger going well ?
it is .
i &apos;m glad .
don &apos;t sweat the drug cases .
gag &apos; em and bag &apos; em . five to ten .
on page two , you &apos;ll find a summary of outstanding continuances .
we may not have enough copies , so share at the back .
let &apos;s not go continuance crazy , okay , folks ?
unless you &apos;re up against goldstein and michaels .
then all continuances are welcome .
matan , what &apos;s up with the pro se ?
guy &apos;s running a unicorn defense .
he killed his business partner for the money ,
and now he &apos;s trying to suggest it was some sort of pentagon conspiracy .
judge matchick saddled him with a wrangler .
alicia florrick .
should be entertaining .
anyone on break , sit in .
anything else ? okay .
let &apos;s get the bad guys .
matan .
why would matchick choose florrick ?
happenstance .
she was there on a settlement .
take cary as second chair .
sir , it was nothing . it &apos;s okay .
it &apos;s happenstance .
it &apos;s an election year .
there &apos;s no such thing as happenstance .
matchick supports peter .
he &apos;s pushing his wife into a prominent position .
cary ?
i want you to take second chair .
matan will bring you up to speed , okay ?
you got it .
you &apos;re up to speed .
he was bleeding profusely from the neck and chest .
there also appeared
to have been a struggle before the shooting . i attempted cpr ,
but the victim died at the scene .
now , detective , at the crime scene ,
you also found shell casings , isn &apos;t that correct ?
objection .
on what grounds ?
on the grounds of foundation .
mr. salle ,
he was about to tell us the foundation .
may i have a ruling , your honor ?
overruled .
exception .
mr. salle , you know that doesn &apos;t mean anything ?
oh , i &apos;m preserving your bias for the record .
oh , dear god . mrs. florrick ?
please , mr. salle , let me argue for you .
i &apos;m very good at it .
it &apos;s not about being good , mrs. florrick .
in a fight between a man being paid
and a man fighting for his life , who would you bet on ?
i &apos;m betting on myself .
don &apos;t turn your back to the jury .
these nine millimeter casings you found at the scene ...
they are consistent with a russian @-@ made makarov semiautomatic .
a very rare handgun ?
that &apos;s correct .
and who owned such a handgun ?
the defendant .
and when you arrested him , did he say what had happened to his gun ?
he said it was missing .
no more questions .
now , detective ,
didn &apos;t i say it had been stolen ?
you did .
you said agents from the government had stolen it .
did i say why ?
objection .
actually , you know what ? forget it .
let the jury hear this .
you said the government was upset
because you had uploaded a leaked video to your web site .
was it this video that played on my web site , opensourcefind.com ?
this video is of a u.s. predator drone assassinating
an unarmed man in afghanistan .
yes , i believe that &apos;s correct .
and did i give you the name of someone to talk to ?
someone who could point to the real killer at the pentagon ?
you said to speak to one of your volunteers : a woman named onya
who &apos;d acquired the video from a leaker .
did you speak to onya , this volunteer ?
okay , i think i &apos;ll object at this point , your honor .
sustained .
mr. salle , i already told you .
the government is not on trial here .
you are .
well , maybe they should be .
do i think the u.s. government killed his business partner ?
no .
but i &apos;ve got nothing else to go on .
look , we &apos;re trying to be more thrifty with kalinda &apos;s hours ,
so i can &apos;t have her chasing phantoms .
just do the best you can with what you &apos;ve got .
what &apos;s your strategy ?
my strategy ?
well , there &apos;s this one juror .
i think he agrees with salle .
every time the judge overrules us ,
you can tell he wants to hear more .
he thinks we &apos;re being censored .
quite a risk . trying to win over one juror .
i only need one for a deadlock .
we can give her half a day .
to hunt down pentagon assassins ?
to find sand to throw in the prosecutor &apos;s case .
kalinda ?
what &apos;s up ?
alicia needs help fingering the pentagon for a murder .
how long do i have ?
the afternoon .
sorry .
what ?
see this month &apos;s chicago magazine ?
sixteenth most eligible bachelor .
we &apos;re fine , kalinda .
yeah , that looked fine .
did you see the photo spread ?
will in a swimsuit .
he wasn &apos;t in a swimsuit .
so you saw it , then ?
talk to him .
he doesn &apos;t want to .
he told me .
he wants to drop it .
yeah . in voice mail .
anything said in voice mail doesn &apos;t count .
salle doesn &apos;t know who leaked the pentagon video .
he was insulated from the leaker
by a go @-@ between activist named onya , no last name .
her last known address .
but she &apos;s paranoid ,
so she moves around a lot to avoid detection .
well , the good thing about amateur paranoids
is , they always leave something behind .
talk to him .
life is short .
the most honest part of the body , which you wouldn &apos;t guess , is the feet .
the feet ? you &apos;re kidding .
no .
look at mrs. timmerman &apos;s feet .
they are pointing away from her husband ,
almost as if to flee .
now , let &apos;s look at mrs. clinton &apos;s feet .
they are facing toward her husband .
this is a marriage that can recover .
now let &apos;s look at alicia florrick &apos;s feet .
one foot is toward her husband .
one foot is away from her husband .
it just signifies ambivalence .
it &apos;s not going away . that &apos;s the problem .
it &apos;s not my scandal . thank you .
it &apos;s colorado .
that &apos;s like going to the moon .
every time they show him , they show you .
every time they show his wife , they show alicia .
so change the subject .
right , to glenn child &apos;s divorce .
no , eli . no .
peter , you can &apos;t keep leaving all your missiles in the silo .
i &apos;m not leaving anything .
this isn &apos;t about being a good guy .
we go after his family ,
then he &apos;s going to come after mine .
he &apos;s coming after yours , either way .
then we &apos;ll wait till he does .
in the meantime , change the subject to something positive .
what am i doing here , anyway ?
get me in front of some woman &apos;s group ,
so we can remind them of the mutual respect .
get me a list of any organizations giving out an award this season .
i don &apos;t care if it &apos;s the knitting needlers of america .
i need a visual .
oh . sorry . uh ...
my friend lives here and she said i could get her key .
are you ... ?
the landlord .
who &apos;s your friend ?
onya .
yeah . uh ...
she moved out .
right . she leave a forwarding address ?
no . no .
she &apos;s a friend of yours ?
yeah .
look , the thing is ,
she has my extra key , and i &apos;m locked out .
i was hoping i could get in .
oh , there &apos;s nothing left in there . she cleaned it out , so ...
it might be shoved to the back of a drawer or something .
do you mind if i just check ?
check ? for your extra key ? um ...
it would really help .
please ?
close the door when you &apos;re done .
thank you .
i found it in the dumpster in the back .
no sim card . she must have taken it when she left the apartment .
so , it &apos;s a dead end ?
for the moment .
but there was somebody there just before me .
i found chipped paint under the air vent screws .
so somebody must have checked the vents after the apartment was cleaned .
yeah . sorry .
i should have cleaned that up .
oh , yes . derrick said you would be dropping by .
this is derrick &apos;s in @-@ house investigator ,
blake , from d.c.
i picked the lock in the apartment .
found a cell phone hidden in the air vent .
it looked like the subject left in a rush .
she left this in the phone . sim card .
much of it &apos;s encrypted .
i can try and decipher if you want .
uh , yeah .
let &apos;s see what you can find .
i wouldn &apos;t mind kalinda trying to decipher .
she &apos;s done it for me before . um ...
yeah . well , why don &apos;t you work on it together ?
did you ever find your extra key ?
you knew who i was ?
yeah .
i wanted to see how you &apos;d play it .
what are you , man of a thousand faces ?
no .
just one .
does that flirtation bit always work for you ?
yeah .
are we going to have trouble ?
no .
no . as far as i &apos;m concerned , it &apos;s your backyard , leela .
sorry . that &apos;s not your name , is it ?
it &apos;s kalinda .
kalinda &apos;s your name . right .
imagine my surprise when i looked at the membership roll
of the women &apos;s auxiliary of the botanical gardens
and saw your name .
i was also surprised to see that the auxiliary has not awarded
a &quot; friend of the auxiliary &quot; in quite some time .
anyway , if you could talk to the auxiliary ...
well , certainly , mr. gold .
how &apos;s the campaign going ?
the campaign ?
it &apos;s going very well , ma &apos;am . thank you .
why ?
oh , no reason .
it &apos;s just that it seems like you &apos;re coming to me more than i might expect .
and how much did you expect , mrs. florrick ?
i imagine that campaigns are very complicated things .
maybe you need ... help .
what kind of help ?
i think we should stay in touch .
i think we should talk regularly .
i can offer you advice and you can ask questions when you are confused .
i think that &apos;s a very good idea .
let &apos;s stay in touch .
objection !
overruled .
exception !
and ye @-@ yes , exception , i get it .
continue , mr. brody .
what other forensic evidence did you collect from the scene , ma &apos;am ?
we found partial palm prints
on the cessna door and fingerprints on the inside .
and who did those prints belong to ?
the defendant .
no further questions .
have i been on that plane before ?
objection , your honor . beyond the scope .
sustained .
these prints of mine on the plane--
that doesn &apos;t mean that i was at any time ... ?
objection .
sustained .
did your investigation reveal you were on the plane ... ?
did your investigation reveal
that i had been on the plane a week before the murder ,
and that could be the source of the fingerprints ?
yes .
are we finished here ,
mr. salle ?
uh , one second , your honor .
mr. salle ?
miss-- i forgot your name .
loren .
loren , sorry .
what happened to the sample # 48 ?
i don &apos;t understand the question .
you collected 48 blood samples .
isn &apos;t that correct ?
no , 47 blood samples .
yes , we have 47 samples according to your evidence list ,
and yet here on the crime scene photo , there is a 48th sample .
that &apos;s outside the designated crime scene .
so , you found blood
outside the designated crime scene ,
and you decided not to include it ?
objection , your honor .
this is a large hangar ,
and this blood sample was found by a tool kit
which could have been left by any random worker .
overruled .
answer the question .
we did a preliminary blood type test of this blood sample ,
as we do with all our samples .
it was o @-@ negative , not consistent with the victim .
and what is my blood type ?
b @-@ positive .
so it wasn &apos;t consistent with my blood type either .
no further questions .
i haven &apos;t said this in a while to anyone .
thank you .
cryptbit encryption ?
you don &apos;t like lasermite ?
try combining lasermite and elcosec .
use them as binary sifters .
they &apos;d cancel each other out .
use lasermite for salting .
so , what did you find out about me ?
some friends in d.c. said you phoned .
you have enemies .
nice-- same phone number .
there , there , there .
every night at 7 : 30 .
yeah .
you recognize it .
stan &apos;s chicken shack .
she &apos;s ordering takeout .
you think she would get takeout again from her new address ?
hey , leela .
we should work together .
stop it .
what ?
it &apos;s been such a difficult time for peter and his family ,
and this award will mean so much to them .
now he needs us .
would you excuse me ?
her daughter @-@ in @-@ law that &apos;s who we should get .
oh , hello , jackie .
hello , ruth .
we were just talking about your daughter @-@ in @-@ law .
where is alicia ?
well , as you know , she works ,
but my granddaughter is here-- grace .
grace .
she &apos;s thinking of joining our cotillion .
grace !
it &apos;s so bogus , huh ?
yeah , i got dragged here .
yeah .
you , too ?
no , no , i &apos;m ... i &apos;m working .
doing what ?
you know .
so has your mom or dad said anything about this other scandal ?
the one right now ?
no . they kind of just try to avoid the whole subject , you know .
they &apos;re still sleeping in separate rooms ?
who &apos;s that ?
oh , steven-- he &apos;s in film school .
so your parents aren &apos;t sleeping together anymore , right ?
and you used to do accounting work for the victim , mr. kimball ?
yes , and mr. salle .
i &apos;m sorry , miss derbeken ,
could you please move your hand ?
yes , sorry .
in fact , you traveled with mr. kimball , didn &apos;t you ?
yes , our job required moving around a lot ,
so i stayed in the same hotel .
and you saw firsthand a dispute between mr. kimball
and the defendant about their web site ?
yes , i did .
in fact , could you describe the letter you saw
sent by mr. salle to the victim a week before the murder ?
object now .
why ?
do it .
objection .
your honor , this isn &apos;t hearsay .
miss derbeken is testifying to a letter she read herself ,
not what was heard .
yes , but , uh ...
best evidence , your honor .
i &apos;m listening .
the original letter offers ...
the original letter offers the best evidence ,
and it can &apos;t be testified to
if the letter is not produced .
where is the letter ?
oh , come on . your honor ,
we can &apos;t establish motive unless we hear from her .
that &apos;s not my problem , mr. brody .
the objection is sustained .
miss derbeken cannot testify to the letter .
know what i want to do if i get out ?
go to law school .
he &apos;s got no case , sir .
he &apos;s still arguing a unicorn defense .
and he &apos;s beating you .
he &apos;s got no case , and he &apos;s beating you .
cary .
don &apos;t do this , he &apos;s a first year .
i don &apos;t care if he &apos;s just out of law school .
can you beat her ?
uh ... we just caught a bad break , mr. childs .
that &apos;s not what i asked .
can you beat her ?
yes .
you &apos;re first chair .
i don &apos;t know how long you plan to stay with us ,
but that &apos;s not how you endear yourself to your coworkers .
oh , is that what this is about , endearment ?
oh , uh , one last thing .
how are you on partners &apos; offices ?
diane has a corner office .
i have a partial corner with more square footage .
we could splurge for either .
one of the things we did at our old office was
move the partners &apos; offices into the core of the building
and made the outside communal associate areas .
it fostered goodwill .
do you prefer an interior office ?
let me think on it .
and i would like to start a partner mentorship program .
well , we already unofficially mentor associates .
i think it &apos;ll create greater goodwill
if we officially mentor .
there &apos;s one more thing .
peer review .
we don &apos;t choose who to fire .
associates grade each other .
it creates community .
yeah , like lord of the flies .
um , well , let us think on that .
are we being played in some way ?
i don &apos;t see how .
i don &apos;t either .
it &apos;s making me suspicious .
stan &apos;s chicken shack on 58th .
yeah , i just phoned a minute ago for my delivery order .
i just want to check i gave you the right address .
the name &apos;s onya .
no delivery by that name .
are you sure you have the right ... ?
stan &apos;s chicken shack .
yeah , i think i might have given you the wrong address .
uh , the name &apos;s onya .
oh , yeah , you got a new address ?
uh , no , i @-@ i think i may have given you the wrong address .
uh , what do you have ?
9625 west marshfield , apartment 5 @-@ ee .
is that right ?
yeah , yeah , that @-@ that &apos;s really good .
thank you , bye .
you ready to take another go at this ?
what is lupus ?
lupus is a disease in which the immune system attacks ...
objection , your honor .
uh , beyond the scope .
hmm , i &apos;m going to overrule on that .
i &apos;d like to see where this is going .
lupus is a disease
in which the immune system attacks the body &apos;s cells and tissue ,
resulting in inflammation and tissue damage .
how common is it ?
fairly common .
it affects perhaps one out of every 1,000 americans .
does the defendant mr. salle suffer from lupus ?
lupus erythematosus , yes , he does .
now , what is another odd artifact of lupus ?
well , if you withdraw medication ,
it can change your blood type .
hmm , so mr. salle could have o @-@ negative blood
one week , and if he changed his medication , b @-@ positive the next ?
that is correct .
wow .
now this blood sample that you took from a tool kit
in the hangar-- this blood sample
that mrs. florrick and her mentor
worked so diligently to get into evidence--
did you expedite a dna test looking for a match ?
i did .
and who did it match ?
mr. salle the defendant .
well , no further questions . the prosecution rests .
onya .
no , no , no , vance sent me .
i work with his lawyers .
i &apos;m not onya you &apos;re looking for ...
okay , they know you &apos;re in there .
don &apos;t go back in there .
come on .
look , vance wants to help , but he needs your help , too .
you know who shot kimball , right ?
was it the government ?
what ?
the feds use strollers .
they &apos;re transmitters .
they &apos;re easy to disguise .
the guy who leaked me the video ...
he was afraid that kimball was going to name him ,
so he killed him .
onya , you have to testify to that .
no . no , he &apos;ll kill you .
he &apos;ll kill me , too .
we can hide your identity .
no , you can &apos;t .
if you bring me into that court , i will plead the fifth .
look at her .
like that &apos;s a real baby .
okay , then tell me the name of the leaker .
i &apos;ll take the risk .
come on . it &apos;s the least you can do for vance .
good news
is we found the leaker .
cia analyst , edgar barkus .
the bad news ?
he &apos;s missing .
office was cleared out a month ago .
so , what are we saying ?
it is a government conspiracy ?
or the pentagon found their leaker .
alicia ?
use her . use onya .
i don &apos;t understand .
prosecution is winning
because they &apos;re arguing a straightforward case
with a straightforward motive .
your client killed over money : possession of his web site .
you need a straightforward alternative .
jealousy .
who &apos;s jealous ?
onya .
but she &apos;ll plead the fifth .
right , so use her .
onya ,
you &apos;re familiar with mr. kimball &apos;s accountant , jeanine derbeken ?
what do you mean , familiar ?
you know who she is ?
yes .
this should be interesting .
you have to go ?
yeah . take care .
and you knew that jeanine would often stay
in mr. kimball &apos;s hotel room when he traveled ?
no .
you didn &apos;t know that ?
but you also traveled with mr. kimball , didn &apos;t you ?
i did , yeah .
and ...
did you ever fight with jeanine ?
with ... ?
you never fought with jeanine over the attentions of mr. kimball ?
objection .
sustained .
so , onya ,
the week before the murder-- this is
the week mr. kimball received the leaked video--
did you and mr. kimball travel to washington d.c. ?
it &apos;s a simple question , onya .
did you and mr. kimball stay together in washington , d.c. ?
i refuse to answer on the grounds that it may incriminate me .
are you sure that &apos;s what you want to do ?
you &apos;re pleading the fifth ?
yes .
you &apos;re worried about relating what happened with the victim
in washington d.c. ?
i refuse to answer on the grounds that it may incriminate me .
miss , i want to make sure i understand what you &apos;re saying .
your honor , the witness already answered ...
are you pleading the fifth because you were involved
in mr. kimball &apos;s murder , or because of the leaked ... ?
your honor , it is not your place to ask my witness .
yes , it is , mrs. florrick .
now , you are taking the fifth ...
your honor , if you compel my witness to answer this question ,
i am moving for an immediate mistrial .
denied . i &apos;m asking a simple question ...
you are not , sir !
mrs. florrick ...
you are piercing the fifth amendment right .
mr. florrick , shut up .
no , sir .
excuse me .
as long as you are attempting to circumvent her fifth amendment right ,
i will not shut up .
you will shut up , or be held in contempt .
then hold me in contempt ,
and i will refer this
to the judicial conduct committee for immediate action .
this court will adjourn until tomorrow morning .
i &apos;m almost done .
what are you up to ?
peter .
i saw you in court today .
yeah ?
you were amazing .
peter , i &apos;ve got to ... study .
peter , i have to study .
okay .
let me .
so , let &apos;s just go at this from a different angle .
do you know of any motive mr. salle might have had to murder mr. kimball ?
i refuse to answer on the grounds that it may incriminate me .
now , are you pleading the fifth because you were involved
in the murder , or ...
i refuse to answer on the grounds that it may incriminate me .
so , you want to follow me again ?
have me do your work for you ?
nope , i have something for you .
i picked it up on my police scanner .
a kid found the murder weapon down by the river .
a russian @-@ made makarov semi @-@ automatic .
the cops have it ?
they &apos;re checking it for prints right now .
my guess is , your client didn &apos;t wipe it down .
how long do we have ?
i know your chicago cops are slow ,
but i &apos;d say you got few minutes .
and you still want to plead the fifth ?
i refuse to answer ...
no more questions .
mrs. florrick ?
your next witness .
defense rests , your honor .
what are you doing ?
we still have to refute the blood evidence .
defense rests .
your honor , the people are unprepared for closing arguments .
that &apos;s unfortunate , mr. agos , because i am .
well , we request a five @-@ minute recess .
no , mr. agos .
this trial has gone on much longer than i anticipated , and i &apos;m tired .
so you go now , or you don &apos;t go .
and where does that leave the defense ?
in tatters .
look at their witnesses . oops .
i &apos;m sorry . their one witness .
your honor , i need to interrupt .
the police have just uncovered a new piece of evidence .
mr.brody , you know as well as i
that once the prosecution starts its closing arguments ,
there is no new evidence .
yes , your honor , but these are extraordinary circumstances .
well , that &apos;s unfortunate , mr. brody .
if the jury deadlocks ,
you may use your extraordinary circumstances in the next trial .
the jury will ignore mr. brody &apos;s statements .
you may continue , mr. agos .
about your peer review suggestion .
we thought we could try it for one year as a pilot program .
okay .
oh , and we &apos;re still working on getting you
a smaller office without a window .
but in the meantime , you &apos;ll have to live with this .
thank you .
you shoot the hoops ?
i do .
we got an afternoon league .
a few judges , lawyers .
we could use some baltimore blood .
oh , you can &apos;t handle some baltimore blood .
that &apos;s how it starts .
still deliberating ?
yep .
you know , that gun they found ?
the feds have a way of making this stuff pop up
right when they need it .
they &apos;re offering you five years .
they &apos;re ... who is ?
the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s office .
five years , second degree .
but you &apos;re ... i mean , we &apos;re not considering it .
yes , we are .
it just takes one .
yeah , it just takes one to deadlock .
yes .
and if the jury deadlocks , the gun is in .
a deadlock works against you .
i can say the government planted ...
oh , vance , stop it .
you did it .
right now , you &apos;re in control .
once the jury comes in , it &apos;s out of your hands .
take the five years .
did he take it ?
the five years ? yes .
it was the smart move .
i &apos;m your new mentor .
