webber has singled you out ?
yeah , anointed me .
he knows about us .
oh , i &apos;m so screwed !
maggie , i told him you were a wildcat .
what ? !
blake should be in our surgery .
callie , stop . - no , i am sorry , but i can &apos;t just stand here and --
you &apos;re embarrassing me !
stay out of it .
if you want to start over , let &apos;s do it .
just like new ?
square one .
what are you doing ?
i barely know you .
at least ask me out on a date first .
did arizona tell you --
i work in peds . i figured it out .
how far along are you ?
nine weeks .
he doesn &apos;t know ?
not yet .
behold .
everything the light touches is yours .
congratulations ... chief .
meredith , you got really good at being alone .
are you saying i can &apos;t be alone anymore ?
no , i think you can .
i just don &apos;t think you want to be .
back in med school ,
i knew a guy who spent his weekends as a magician
for children &apos;s birthday parties .
okay , this is only a dry @-@ run , and it &apos;s the first of many .
won &apos;t be perfect , but once we start ,
i don &apos;t want to stop until we get to the other side .
agreed ?
okay .
let &apos;s go .
yep .
it makes a weird kind of sense .
if you plan on sawing a person in half ,
you &apos;re going to need to practice .
when you take the stage and all eyes are on you ,
you don &apos;t want the audience to see you sweat .
three days ago , i received a call
from a colleague at bauer medical ,
a military facility just outside of seattle .
a consult was requested for a 35 @-@ year @-@ old male patient
with an osteosarcoma of the left pelvis ,
lumbar spine , and sacrum .
you only want them to see the magic .
seconded .
traditionally , a tumor like this
would be approached with aggressive chemoradiation
that would give him a few years to live , at most .
there &apos;s got to be something better than that .
torres thought so , too .
she had a better idea .
torres &apos; plan was to use the vascularized fibular grafts
from the amputated leg
to attach the right leg and pelvis
to the spine at the midline .
this would provide axial stability and , potentially ...
okay .
... the ability to walk .
that &apos;s ...
impressive ?
... insane .
i mean , i mean that in the best way .
what did we just do ?
a miracle .
it &apos;s a solid plan , torres . you should be proud .
i am . but we still have a few days left ,
so i &apos;d like to run through it twice tomorrow ,
see if we can get our time down .
right . but first , sleep .
yeah , all the sleep i can carry .
folks , hang on . we have a problem .
colonel miller just called from bauer medical .
our patient just took a fall and has fractured his pelvis .
what ?
our timeline has changed .
his fractured pelvis has compromised blood flow
to the leg we need to salvage .
our window &apos;s closing .
if we wait , there won &apos;t be anything left
to use in the reconstruction .
okay , well , when do they want to do it ?
tonight .
i ... would &apos;ve liked another run @-@ through .
okay , when -- when -- when can he come ? - he &apos;s not .
after the fall , the patient &apos;s not stable enough to move .
we have to go to him .
it &apos;s an away game .
it &apos;s an away game .
it &apos;s not even fair .
i mean , no one else got a chance to volunteer to go .
what can i say ? i &apos;m good at ortho ,
i &apos;m good at plastics -- i &apos;m a switch hitter .
i &apos;m an integral part of the team .
wilson did the only trial run .
of course i would rather take you .
i &apos;m kind of stuck here .
whatever . i still get to go .
now , listen , about bauer .
bye !
military hospitals
are a mix of civilian and military doctors
with a very strict idea about hierarchy .
okay , hunt , i get it . these are your people .
we &apos;ll do you proud .
take me with you .
i thought you didn &apos;t want me messing in your career .
maybe just this once . this surgery &apos;s gonna be amazing .
sorry , blake . no special treatment .
same thing i tell my husband .
hunt ! we got incoming .
be right there . good luck !
you know curt morgan ? the neuro @-@ ophthalmologist ?
i do , yeah . he &apos;s a nice guy .
he is a nice guy .
and he was asking about you .
bailey .
i &apos;m just saying he was asking .
who was asking about what ?
curt morgan was asking about dr. grey .
wilson .
oh , curt . yeah , he &apos;s great .
we play ball with him on wednesday nights .
okay , what about we stop talking about curt morgan
and focus on what we have to do ?
or we could talk about the fact that he &apos;s tall and handsome ,
divorced , funny , doesn &apos;t have kids ... handsome .
you said handsome twice .
that wasn &apos;t an accident .
hey , remember , we &apos;re guests here .
hunt wants us on our best behavior .
i &apos;ve spent a lot of time working with the military .
if we &apos;re respectful and do our jobs ,
we won &apos;t ruffle any feathers .
dr. bailey .
colonel miller .
so nice to finally put a face with the voice .
likewise . this is captain vaughn .
she &apos;s here to help make sure you have everything you --
colonel , what the hell ?
dr. bailey , this is major thorpe . he &apos;s cars--
i &apos;m sergeant carson &apos;s surgeon .
and you are ... the &quot; dream team &quot; ?
you can &apos;t just make decisions for my patient .
we &apos;re not here to step on toes , doctor .
you &apos;re here to make my patient a guinea pig .
how about we take a step back ?
how about you take 10 steps back , through that door ,
because no one &apos;s touching my patient ! - thorpe --
sir , i understand that you want what &apos;s best for your patient .
is the surgery new and risky ?
yes , it is . but if it works --
oh , it &apos;ll work .
major thorpe , your chief asked for our help
because he knows we &apos;re the best .
now , you called us the dream team ,
and that &apos;s exactly what we are .
we are miracle workers .
now , the sooner you recognize that ,
the sooner we can get to the business of saving a life ,
which is all any of us are here to do , yourself included .
if you &apos;ll all follow me .
i think you may have ruffled some feathers .
&quot; miracle workers &quot; ?
you think maybe you overdid that ?
we &apos;ve practiced once , torres -- once .
i might &apos;ve gotten a little carried away .
a little ?
we &apos;re so screwed .
karev wants me in the e.r.
look , i &apos;m on call all night ,
but if it &apos;s slow , i mean ,
i could meet you back here in a couple hours .
sounds tempting .
oh , pierce , there you are .
yes , riggs , here i am .
wanted to see about getting you in
on an elective vats in the morning .
yeah , absolutely .
that is a two @-@ hander , so let &apos;s do it .
i &apos;ll put you down for 9 : 30 , yeah ?
cool . cheers .
that was close .
are we still doing this ?
yes . because it &apos;s a secret ,
and that &apos;s what you do with secrets -- you keep them secret .
yeah , but what &apos;s the point ?
look , your sisters know , webber knows .
i @-@ it &apos;s getting a little old , honestly , okay ?
and -- and i got to get out of here .
karev &apos;s paged me three times already .
coming through .
clear the way !
deluca , where the hell have you been ?
grab me some kerlix .
lisa . have you seen lisa ? she &apos;s our captain .
let me guess . ponytail , hair bow ?
god , she &apos;s gonna be so mad .
we didn &apos;t stick the final pose , and it wasn &apos;t even that hard .
it was just a 13 @-@ person synchronized liberty twist .
13 , wow .
pulse is over 130 .
get an ekg and a metabolic panel and add a tox .
nobody was listening to each other .
danielle hit her trick too soon ,
so everyone else had to match , and --
all right , just try to calm down a little , okay ?
are you kidding ? we were in the final round !
we were about to qualify for nationals !
slight tenderness to the abdomen ,
but i want to do an ultrasound to make sure everything is okay .
oh , my god . dani , are you okay ? !
everything hurts .
i can &apos;t believe this . i ca--
i ca--
hey , maxine , are you a little dizzy ?
maxine ?
i am .
my life is over .
page neuro .
no telling how hard she hit her head when she fell .
her b.p. &apos; s through the roof .
and you understand the risks of the surgery
that we &apos;re talking about ?
i &apos;ve explained the risk in detail .
yeah , he won &apos;t shut up about the risk .
he &apos;s explained the benefits , too , i hope .
and keep in mind , with some aggressive chemo and radiation ,
you &apos;ve got a chance at a couple of good years .
and with our approach , you have a shot at a full life , many --
brian , you &apos;re sick .
i &apos;m not convinced you can withstand this kind of surgery .
you roll the dice on this one ,
we could lose you on the table tonight .
listen , i &apos;ve spent five tours of duty , all around the world .
i missed the births of both my girls .
i have another one on the way .
i want the life i &apos;ve been missing .
if you can give me that ...
well , i &apos;m all @-@ in .
well ?
we &apos;re a go .
your work better be as good as your talk .
dr. thorpe , we &apos;ll see you in the o.r.
let &apos;s not waste any more time .
we need to get to the o.r. , and dr. avery needs to be shown
where he can set up for the bone @-@ graft harvest .
yep .
we &apos;re really doing this ?
it &apos;s gonna be great .
okay . okay , this &apos;ll work .
i &apos;m glad you think so .
do you see everything you need ?
uh , you know , i need a bovie in here , please .
i &apos;ll grab it if you let me watch .
the bone @-@ graft retrieval .
sorry , we &apos;re a military hospital .
i @-@ i see mostly trauma @-@ related patch @-@ up jobs .
you have a reputation for a much more refined approach .
my reputation ? i have a reputation ?
i googled you .
i mean , i googled all of you .
everyone &apos;s really excited about the surgery .
we don &apos;t get a lot of chances
to see someone with your level of expertise .
um , you know what ? yeah . sure .
you can watch .
thank you .
i &apos;ll be right back with that bovie .
could she flirt any harder ?
what ? nobody &apos;s flirting with anybody .
oh , come on . &quot; i googled you &quot; ?
she was totally flirting . so were you .
i was not ! what did i even say ?
you didn &apos;t have to say anything .
all of this ... is a flirt .
i &apos;m gonna need you to be still .
i mean , she barely even looks hurt
when my face is split open .
maxine screwed us .
danielle &apos;s the one who threw us off .
she didn &apos;t put her weight in her heel
when she knows she has to -- ow .
what ? are you trying to break it more ?
i am so over them .
we have worked too hard and sacrificed too much
to let maxine and dani humiliate us like that .
they are out .
down .
done . hashtag that .
that girl is the reason i hated high school .
what a power trip .
she can &apos;t just kick somebody off the team .
are you kidding me ? she &apos;s the power center here .
she &apos;s cheer captain and squad leader .
what &apos;s the difference ?
you see the way they all look at her .
she &apos;s the top of the social food chain .
she calls all the shots , decides who &apos;s in , who &apos;s out .
she says jump , they ask , &quot; off which bridge ? &quot;
how do you know all this ?
&apos;cause i was squad leader .
it was exhausting .
you were the reason i hated high school .
i actually loved high school .
i bet . everybody loved high school in the &apos; 50s .
yep . i will send someone right up . that was psych .
uh , one of their patients needs a surgical consult .
oh , dibs !
me , please !
come on . shoot for it .
warren , head up to psych
and bring spencer with you .
yes !
what the hell ? !
i &apos;m on it .
maybe we could intubate them .
they would be so , so quiet .
maxine , can you touch your nose for me ?
are they talking about me ? lisa and chelsea ?
i know they are . they &apos;re always talking about someone .
other hand , please .
i &apos;ve been trying so hard
just to make the team a team , you know ?
maxine , you &apos;re working yourself up again .
take some deep breaths .
you can &apos;t advance in cheer if you don &apos;t trust each other .
balance and trust , that &apos;s the foundation --
i keep telling them .
so maybe i &apos;m a little bitchy about it .
so ? it &apos;s not like lisa isn &apos;t bitchy every single day of her life .
wow , that was all one breath .
your neuro exam is clear .
i &apos;d like to get a head ct just to be safe .
i just wanted us to win .
what &apos;s so bad about that ?
for starters , you &apos;re 17 with the bp of a 50 @-@ year @-@ old .
nothing too good about that .
never been up to psych before .
to be clear , i didn &apos;t actually go to school in the &apos; 50s .
it &apos;s dark up here .
smells weird .
i mean , i know i &apos;m older , but i &apos;m not old .
patients keep screaming .
patients keep screaming .
dr. siegel , right ?
you called for an abdominal consult ?
yeah , right here .
i was doing his intake ,
and he just started clutching his stomach .
sir ? sir ? can you hear me ?
he &apos;s non @-@ communicative .
pulse is 130 and thready . i @-@ i think he &apos;s --
yep . he &apos;s crashing .
should we take him out of here ?
i can &apos;t get a pressure .
yeah , he &apos;s bleeding into his belly from a triple @-@ a.
we need to get him into the o.r.
i think i lost his pulse .
he &apos;s not gonna make it to surgery .
i &apos;m just gonna have to open him up right here .
oh , that &apos;s not going to happen .
i need a thoracotomy tray , a crash cart , and blood
and a scalpel -- now .
th--there &apos;s nothing here ! there &apos;s no --
this is the psych ward . there &apos;s nothing sharp here .
there &apos;s nothing sharp here !
it &apos;s not allowed .
you got to be kidding me .
look , go find me something i can cut with !
you don &apos;t think maybe we should wait for an attending ?
wait . you &apos;re not an attending ?
spencer , get me a scalpel now !
okay , yeah .
i &apos;m not feeling good about this , torres .
nothing like walking into a surgery
where i &apos;m not feeling good .
you feeling good , grey ?
we practiced it once .
we &apos;re about to pull an all @-@ nighter .
sure . feeling great .
everything &apos;s gonna be fine , you guys .
we just have to be squirrels about this .
couldn &apos;t have heard you correctly there .
oh , you know , squirrels --
they store nuts for the winter , right ?
but they don &apos;t do it all at once .
they do it one nut at a time .
everyone has their part to play ,
so everyone just needs to handle their own nut .
we do that , we get all the nuts .
makes sense .
does it , though ?
all right , if we &apos;re doing this ,
let &apos;s not waste any more time .
yeah , uh , thorpe , can you give us one minute ?
i need to confer with my team .
dr. bailey , are we conferring ?
we &apos;re praying . torres is right .
we &apos;ll be fine if we each just do our part .
figure it doesn &apos;t hurt to ask god to do his .
callie , how long do we stand here doing this ?
i don &apos;t know . how should i know ?
you pray and stuff .
i mean , what &apos;s she looking for ?
some kind of sign or something .
if i was , i sure wouldn &apos;t hear it
over the two of you .
sorry .
apologies .
you told karev ?
you told karev about your baby situation
and you haven &apos;t even told jackson ?
i didn &apos;t tell karev anything .
he figured it out .
it &apos;s like he could smell it on me or something .
you can do that if you spend enough time in peds .
pregnant ladies have a smell .
what ?
oh , calm down . i &apos;m just kidding .
how many more people have to find out about this
before you tell -- - find out about what ?
nothing .
you two have a secret .
no , we don &apos;t .
what is it ?
did you find out about deluca ? come on .
robbins , you have hospital gossip .
you &apos;re gonna hold out on me ?
spill .
no , there &apos;s nothing to tell .
sorry . i need a crash cart , a thoracotomy tray ,
and , um -- -spencer .
d @-@ do you need something ?
yeah , i @-@ i need you .
where the hell is mitchell ?
i think you should call it . h @-@ he &apos;s been down a long time .
shut up . just shut up , please .
i think i got a faint pulse .
i think that &apos;s your pulse you &apos;re feeling .
i got to open him up now . if i don &apos;t , he &apos;s dead .
again , i &apos;m not gonna allow you
to open up a man in my ward .
this is not an o.r. you are not an attending .
w @-@ what in the hell --
no . no , no , no .
are -- are you insane ?
dr. siegel , this man is going to die .
you are way out of line here .
and it will be your fault ,
so please , don &apos;t make me put my hands on you .
are you threatening me now ?
no , no , no ! no , no , no !
hey , i found dr. webber , and i go --
okay ! too -- too late .
warren , what are you doing ?
spencer , get over here .
help me spread his ribs . - spread his --
reach in , push your fingers through his muscles .
harder ! come on ! do it !
warren !
i got it . i got his aorta in my hand .
yeah , i got a pulse .
dr. webber , can , uh -- can you get an o.r. for us ?
okay , callie , we are good to go up here .
all right . okay , i just need to inspect the s.i. joint ,
make sure we &apos;re ready to amputate the left leg
with the hemipelvis .
okay . okay .
margins are adequate , and the stasis is achieved .
landmarks are looking ...
good .
torres ?
looking good ?
yep . yep , yep , yep .
just ... want to be sure . &apos; cause once it &apos;s off , it &apos;s off .
excuse me ?
bailey ? this looks good , right ?
right there .
it &apos;s gonna have to come off one way or the other .
yes , i know that .
it &apos;s just , after this , there &apos;s really no turning back .
i mean , none , so ...
torres ...
be a squirrel .
okay .
oscillating saw , please .
owen is completely serious about starting over .
he wants to take me on a date .
like , a &quot; date &quot; date .
like , no sex , just dinner and a movie .
kind of into it .
deluca wants to take us public .
god , he wants to hold hands in the hallway or something .
i like holding hands .
w @-@ what if we hold hands and make out ?
when was the last time you made out with a guy
without it going any further than that ?
why do we have to parade it around ?
you don &apos;t , but what is the problem
if deluca wants to .
it &apos;s just you .
this still with deluca ?
yes , &quot; this still . &quot;
i don &apos;t even know what &quot; this &quot; is ,
and i don &apos;t need to figure it out in front of everyone else .
how &apos;s our cheerleader ?
well , there &apos;s no sign of a bleed .
it looks like a mild concussion .
what if it ends ?
then i &apos;m the woman who dated the pretty boy
and it all fell apart .
we done here ?
who will take me seriously then ?
i &apos;m -- i &apos;m supposed to take you seriously right now ?
i &apos;m a very serious person !
incredible .
excuse me ?
just your technique ,
the way you preserve the vessels .
it &apos;s really smooth .
sorry . i --
i have a patient i should check on .
but i &apos;ll be back .
what ?
nothing .
that wasn &apos;t flirting .
i mean , i know what flirting looks like .
i didn &apos;t say anything .
all right .
how we doing with the harvest ?
oh , slow moving ,
unlike dr. vaughn , who &apos;s super fast .
wilson .
what &apos;re you talking about ?
she was flirting with him .
she was not .
well , i mean , i don &apos;t see why not .
she doesn &apos;t know him the way we do .
what the hell &apos;s that mean ?
oh , you know .
we see you every day .
we &apos;re used to all of that .
all right , you two , i need to focus .
yes , by all means .
your head c.t. is fine .
you probably have a mild concussion . not a big deal .
but you need to figure out a way to control your stress .
i know . i &apos;ve always been like this .
my parents say i &apos;m high @-@ strung .
your parents are on their way ?
yeah , coach called them .
lisa , it was an accident !
you never stick the mount .
you trick too early , no matter how many times we tell you not to .
edwards , get them to chill .
guys , it &apos;s an emergency room .
can you please save the yelling for actual emergencies ?
so , what , you think i did it on purpose ?
she thinks you &apos;re a liability .
truth .
what &apos;s going on ?
lisa &apos;s kicking me off the team .
what ? lis-- no , you can &apos;t do that .
how about we don &apos;t do any of this ?
do you need me to separate you ?
last i checked , i was team captain .
last i checked , you were a megabitch .
enough !
dani is the best climber we &apos;ve got .
her kicks are incredible .
you &apos;re just defending her because she &apos;s your bestie
and you &apos;re basically attached at the hip , so ...
blake , can you quiet her down ?
what do you want me to do , sedate them ?
what does that have to do with anything ?
guys , be quiet .
you didn &apos;t belong up there .
you &apos;re clearly not pyramid material .
blake , keep her quiet !
well , you quiet yours down !
who says i even want to cheer with and of you anyway ?
good ! because you &apos;re bringing us all down !
literally !
everybody shut up !
i don &apos;t have a pulse .
is that maxine ?
blake , charge the paddles to 200 .
what happened ?
what &apos;s happening ?
is she okay ?
maxine ?
is she dying ?
oh , my god .
what happened to her ?
guys , look .
is she dead ?
somebody , curtain !
clear !
how &apos;s that hand , warren ?
i &apos;m losing feeling in it .
worried i &apos;m gonna let the aorta go .
okay , well , we &apos;ll get you out of this .
rib spreader , spencer . get a clamp ready .
got it . i got it .
okay . what &apos;s his pressure ?
uh , holding steady -- 90 systolic .
of all the stupid , irresponsible ...
i cannot fathom what possessed you to pull a stunt like --
i don &apos;t know what else i should have done .
hey , you don &apos;t want to get me started on &quot; should &quot; right now .
you should &apos;ve called an attending
the second you walked in there .
you should &apos;ve known the situation
was nowhere near under your control .
and right now , you should be thanking god
that i &apos;m here to clean up your mess .
yes , sir . i &apos;ll do what--
yeah , you &apos;ll do whatever i damn well say .
right now , you better be praying
that this man doesn &apos;t die on the table .
maxine , you with me ? stay with me .
i had a heart attack ?
how were her electrolytes before she coded ?
good . within normal limits .
her heart rate was over 200 on the monitor .
did lisa see it ? did she see me ?
maxine , you did not have a heart attack .
you have a heart condition -- wpw syndrome .
it causes dramatic fluctuations in your heart rate .
wait , wait -- - normally , i would treat it with medication ,
but your symptoms are pretty severe ,
so i want to take it up to surgery to correct it right now .
no , but my parents --
i &apos;m sorry , but we don &apos;t have time to wait for your parents , okay ?
call upstairs . prep for a cardiac ablation .
will i still be able to cheer ?
lisa already hates me .
if she thinks i &apos;m sick , she &apos;s gonna kick me off the team , too .
i can &apos;t get kicked off . the team is my life .
can &apos;t you downplay it or something , keep it a secret ?
i just -- i really don &apos;t want this to go public , you know ?
i &apos;ll handle them .
don &apos;t worry .
i &apos;ll take these debakey &apos;s .
dr. thorpe , are you ready with the ileal conduit ?
almost there .
great . right on time . good .
damn it .
this bone &apos;s friable .
well , i must say , your work is impeccable .
oh , yeah ? you think so ?
beautiful lembert , dr. grey .
watch out . you almost sound glad we &apos;re here .
dr. grey , can you come with me for a sec ?
you want me to step away from the table ?
mm @-@ hmm . i need you on this .
go ahead . i &apos;m good .
callie , what ?
i don &apos;t think i can do this .
i can &apos;t believe this is happening .
i can &apos;t believe maxine is dying .
oh , i didn &apos;t say she &apos;s dying .
she and i have hung together forever --
since elementary school .
you &apos;re such a good friend to her .
oh , shut up . this is all your fault .
you &apos;re the reason she had a heart attack .
it &apos;s not a heart attack .
i didn &apos;t do anything to her .
how dare you ! - okay --
you pushed her like you push all of us .
calm down .
i push because i care !
and because you suck !
calm down .
i suck ? your hair sucks !
your face sucks !
my face doesn &apos;t suck .
gerber baby . gerber baby .
all of you sucks ! that &apos;s the worst comeback in the world .
oh , no , it &apos;s not .
god , i hated high school .
yeah , well , you were like 11 in high school .
diffuse s.t. elevations .
her coronaries are spasming .
we &apos;ll need to open them up .
i &apos;ll need the ultrasound and a 5 @-@ french sheath .
prep a drug @-@ eluting stent .
push 75 of lido and a bolus of nitro .
right away , doctor .
look at this girl .
she &apos;s stressing herself into a heart failure
over whether these little popularity vultures
will allow her into the in crowd like it &apos;s life and death .
it &apos;s all life and death to them .
yeah . thank god we grew out of that .
yeah . and look at you now .
yeah .
what do you mean , &quot; look at me now &quot; ?
you and deluca .
wha-- come on .
my point exactly . i work with teenagers every day .
i know what high school crap looks like .
multifocal pvc &apos;s from the ischemia .
she &apos;s not responding to the meds .
pull in the cart and prep the paddles .
yes , doctor .
you &apos;re the big quarterback ,
and he &apos;s the little freshman nerd girl
you &apos;re embarrassed to be seen with in public .
what ? that &apos;s misogynistic and wrong .
i am the nerd girl . i &apos;ve always been the nerd girl .
not around here . around here , you &apos;re a prom queen .
you &apos;re all @-@ state .
attendings are the popular crowd ,
and he &apos;s nobody , and that bugs you .
ugh . she &apos;s in fib .
all right .
charge to 200 .
charging .
everybody clear .
nothing . again .
all right , we have sinus .
no , this is not high school . this is life . this is work .
yeah , exactly , and look around .
i live with a resident .
torres dates one .
meredith married an attending .
nobody cares except you .
let &apos;s get that stent in .
why are you not in the o.r. ?
tell him what you told me .
what &apos;s going on ?
i can &apos;t do the reconstruction .
torres , what the hell ?
i had to re--
i had to resect the wider margins
to get to healthy bone , okay ?
the fibular grafts will be too small
to hold everything in place .
i &apos;ve got no way to dock the leg .
we don &apos;t have a fallback plan here .
okay , i need you to hear me .
this is not a matter of confidence , okay ?
it &apos;s not me . it is the bone .
i am saying that , with the pelvis that i have left ,
i literally cannot do it .
well , you better do something .
she &apos;s right . look , if we stop now ,
we &apos;re leaving him worse off than when we got him .
he &apos;s not gonna survive the night .
ok-- stop . stop it . okay ?
you guys aren &apos;t telling me anything i don &apos;t already know .
just , i @-@ i need a minute . i need some space to think .
okay ? you all just go back in there and ... irrigate .
i don &apos;t know . just buy me some time , okay ?
okay , you heard her . let &apos;s just give her some space .
i will think of something .
come on .
damn it !
she &apos;s coming back , right ?
she &apos;s coming back .
good . because he &apos;s been under for a long time .
listen , i know you &apos;ve had your reservations ,
but when we &apos;re done --
i still have my reservations .
i &apos;ve known carson - ever since the medical corps .
he &apos;s a one @-@ night stand for you .
i &apos;m sorry ?
look , you fly in , do a flashy surgery
that &apos;ll make all the journals , and you &apos;re gone in the morning .
and i &apos;m still here to help him make sense of what you did .
you &apos;re leaving him with one leg in the middle of his body .
you say he &apos;ll walk again ? how ?
how &apos;s that even gonna work ?
not to mention how you &apos;re compromising
his gastrointestinal system , his nervous system .
he thinks you &apos;re giving him his life back ,
but what &apos;s that life gonna look like ?
we &apos;ll follow up . of course we will .
dr. torres will be available .
will she ? when &apos;s that ?
you didn &apos;t get through to them at all ?
whatever . i hope they eat each other .
look . he &apos;s down there , all right .
deluca . is it true ?
warren cut a guy open with a clipboard ?
it is .
i feel like i &apos;d get in trouble for something like that .
and he gets a surgery out of it .
it must be nice being married to the chief .
look at wilson .
all she has to do is sleep with grey &apos;s bff .
of course she gets the wonder surgery .
come on . you &apos;re --
i mean , you &apos;re seeing torres , right ?
callie doesn &apos;t give me anything .
besides , she was dating torres
before she even started working here .
she &apos;s not nailing an attending to get ahead .
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s what &apos;s going on here .
really ? warren &apos;s married to the chief ,
so he &apos;s scrubbed in down there on a surgery
while we &apos;re stuck watching up here .
you don &apos;t think the two are related ?
i know they are .
it &apos;s unfair .
uncool .
lame .
so lame .
oh , dear god .
we sound just like ...
yeah , we do .
but we &apos;re not like those girls .
well , i &apos;m not .
oh .
excuse me ?
i was never like one of those girls .
i never fit in the usual molds ,
i always did my own thing , i never wore a hair bow ,
and i never worried about it .
and you think i did ?
you said yourself you were one of them .
like &quot; boss lady &quot; one of them .
you &apos;re right .
i was .
where are you going ?
good blood flow to the kidneys .
you know what this means , dr. spencer ?
that the patient &apos;s gonna survive , sir ?
well , it means that dr. warren will only be facing suspension
instead of criminal @-@ assault charges .
sir , i understand you &apos;re upset --
the time for pulling boneheaded stunts is long past --
&quot; boneheaded &quot; ? what about saving a man &apos;s life is boneheaded ?
warren
sir , i may be a resident ,
but i have been a doctor a lot longer .
the other residents love to give me crap
about how much older than them i am ,
but at the end of the day , i &apos;m also wiser , too .
all right , this wasn &apos;t a stunt . this was a judgment call .
i took a risk , it paid off , and this man is alive .
now , i understand -- i broke rules ,
and i need to pay the price for that , but ...
i &apos;m not an idiot .
and i don &apos;t deserve to be spoken to as though i am .
no , what you deserve is a hell of a lot worse .
what you call a calculated risk is what i call foolish .
don &apos;t confuse the two , warren .
you did not show skill today .
you showed bravado , and that is dangerous .
suction .
callie .
don &apos;t -- get back in there . it &apos;s fine , it &apos;s fine .
i &apos;m -- i &apos;m -- i &apos;m thinking . okay , i just need to think .
you want space .
yes !
i get it . i keep asking for space .
people keep not giving it to me ,
bugging me about hot doctors asking for my number .
and i keep shutting them down because --
why ? why are we talking about this ?
because it &apos;s not always the worst thing
when people push you .
when people push you , they &apos;re trying to help you .
i &apos;m trying to help you . let &apos;s figure this out , please .
you can &apos;t . it &apos;s my specialty .
it &apos;s on me . and i am trying .
i just , i don &apos;t know how to make --
so if we had another practice run
and we were in the cadaver lab
and you had all the time in the world ,
where would you start ?
we don &apos;t have time !
that &apos;s the problem .
okay . so what &apos;s the first thing you would do ?
i don &apos;t know !
yes , you do . i know you do .
i would ...
review the biomechanics , and then i would ...
recalculate the angles .
okay . and then ... ?
okay , ladies ! okay , ladies !
hi !
here &apos;s how this is gonna go . your teammate is down .
she needs you . she needs your support .
you &apos;re her spotters -- all of you .
&apos;cause you &apos;re her team ,
and it &apos;s time you started acting like one .
if you want to talk medicine , fine .
but -- sorry --
you have no clue about our team , okay ?
so ...
i mean , who the hell does she think she is anyway ?
cheer captain .
promoted as a sophomore for a triple @-@ year reign
because i was just that good .
led my team - to victory after victory --
regionals , nationals , internationals --
three years in a row . yeah .
that &apos;s amazing .
so let me break this down for you .
you are jealous of her because she and maxine are close now ,
so you got all butt hurt ,
but they aren &apos;t actually trying to leave you out .
are you ? danielle .
uh ... no , ma &apos;am .
good .
you see , lisa ?
it &apos;s time for you to lose that chip on your shoulder .
it &apos;s a double full basket toss . throw it up , move on .
you &apos;ve got cheerleading to do .
she told you she &apos;d be in soon ?
yes .
b.p. &apos; s dropping .
hang a dopamine drip .
hey , what , is she on the phone ?
why don &apos;t you give her a minute ?
shh .
we don &apos;t have any more minutes .
his b.p. is dropping , and he &apos;s fluid overloaded .
i think we have a couple more minutes .
you know what i think ?
you people don &apos;t know what you &apos;re doing .
you didn &apos;t have the plan .
you weren &apos;t ready to move , and you moved anyway .
and i think you knew that when you came through that door .
and i think he &apos;s gonna suffer as a result of it .
listen , here &apos;s the thing --
i &apos;m gonna do a back flip !
what the hell
for the sacrum !
i cut off the proximal end of the femur ,
i flip it around backwards , and i make it into a sacrum .
can you do that ?
mayo &apos;s done it a few times . we &apos;ll see .
hell , yes , i can do it !
avery , let &apos;s go see a leg about a femur .
we have a plan .
we &apos;re the dream team .
damn .
told you .
it &apos;s a miracle .
whew , we almost just killed that guy .
oh my god . right ?
skin of our teeth .
thank you , jesus .
oh , my phone &apos;s been blowing up .
i got to go -- now .
so , the good news is , the surgery went very well .
hey , edwards , what do you think you &apos;re doing ?
they can &apos;t be up here .
you want to wake up the whole floor ?
it &apos;s not gonna be a problem , dr. karev .
these ladies aren &apos;t gonna make a sound .
are we , ladies ?
no , ma &apos;am .
no .
we &apos;d just like to see maxine .
would that be okay ?
uh ... yeah .
okay .
i &apos;m gonna need you to show me how you did that .
just a matter of leadership .
yeah , but , no , really .
i want updates every hour .
if that man &apos;s hemoglobin drops so much as a point ,
i want to be paged .
well , a single point isn &apos;t exactly cause for you to --
you don &apos;t have autonomy here , warren .
i make the calls from here on out .
understand ?
understood , sir .
uh , someone want to tell me why i received
not one , but two , separate phone calls
from two separate attendings
telling me my husband had lost his mind ?
look , it was a unique situation --
oh , i got an earful on how unique it was .
i &apos;m clear on the situation .
excuse us , please .
miranda , listen , i --
okay .
chief , i know you &apos;re angry --
i am angry that i have a resident
who ignored every single protocol he &apos;s been taught .
i &apos;m disappointed by the ego and arrogance
that this resident has displayed .
and i &apos;m embarrassed - that the resident in question
happens to be my husband !
wow . okay .
oh , come on ! you know better than this , ben warren .
you are better than this .
now i got -- i got to set up sit @-@ downs with both attendings ,
and i have to discipline you !
you &apos;re making an already difficult night
that much harder .
well , i &apos;m sorry i had to add to your workload , miranda ,
but i was trying to save a life .
the man was dying .
and how is he now ?
alive . stable . i got to him in time .
no , you got lucky .
if you &apos;d been left - with a dead man on that table
after you did what you did ...
what ?
well ...
i wouldn &apos;t be letting you off with just a 3 @-@ day suspension .
you &apos;re suspending me ?
you &apos;re damn right i am !
because no -- - no special treatment !
come on !
that said , you opened up a man &apos;s chest
with your bare hands and a clipboard .
yeah , you got to walk me through this one .
i want to hear every detail .
hey .
are you still --
yeah , still here . all night .
we have that vats this morning .
we can push it to tonight if you need sleep .
yes . that would be great .
yeah , what time were you thinking ?
oh , actually ...
very good .
um , dr. deluca ?
go ahead .
can you come here a minute , please ?
um , dr. riggs ?
i &apos;m sorry .
i cannot join you on that case tonight
because i have plans ...
... with dr. deluca .
a date .
okay .
whom i &apos;ve been seeing . we &apos;ve been seeing each other --
as a couple , romantically ... in romance .
so you want to keep the surgery this morning , then ?
yes , that would be fine .
okay .
all right . i &apos;ll see you in there .
that was hard to watch .
shut up .
it was hard to do .
it was really hard to watch , though .
so , i -- i did it .
right ?
yeah .
no , you did it .
there &apos;s a reason we like to keep things to ourselves .
oh , i was wrong . i can admit that .
it &apos;s great what you did in there .
i &apos;m just glad i saw it .
well , it was nice working with you .
see ? you fly in , you fly out .
well , we said we &apos;ll follow up , and we will .
when you have an audience ,
even the smallest moments end up feeling huge .
well , i &apos;d like that -- to follow up with you .
it makes the really big moments
seem positively earth @-@ shattering .
okay . so , here is my service ,
and the hospital number &apos;s on there , as well ,
if you want to follow up with torres .
great . i &apos;ll -- i &apos;ll do that .
let &apos;s go . take care .
thank you .
yep , that guy definitely just asked for your number .
like , asked for your number .
yeah , to follow up about the patient .
no . i know when someone &apos;s flirting .
okay ? that &apos;s what flirting looks like .
the trick is not letting the pressure
keep you from taking big chances .
meredith , let &apos;s go . what , did you forget something ?
you just go out there ...
oh , come on !
... naked and afraid ...
shut up . it was nothing .
... and pretend no one &apos;s looking .
