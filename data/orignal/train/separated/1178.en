Oh, careful, Em, they're already pretty strong.
I've gotten really good at this.
Forget it.
She was driving that night, guys. I remembered.
You have to promise not to tell.
That you can see?
I am still a target. You owe it to me.
All of you!
My mom was in a car accident.
She felt like someone was trying to run her off the road.
Are you Emily Fields?
Yes.
I'm Maya's cousin Nate.
What was my mother doing here?
I can't talk.
My new attorney made me promise.
It's Lucas. What is he doing out so late? Shh!
There's no more "A," So why are you lying to me now?
I feel like I only exist in half of your life.
I'm done, hanna.
What do you think Mona said to Wilden?
If she knows that we were at Ali's grave that night--
we would be in jail right now.
I thought Hanna was joining us for dinner.
Hanna hasn't eaten since Tuesday.
Should we grab a pizza and go over there?
No, unless the topping is Caleb.
If you guys want to to see her, can you just go without me?
I already feel bad enough that I convinced her to tell Caleb.
With or without you she was backed into a corner.
This "A" does not feel like a high school girl playing games.
Ok, well, if you figure out those rules,
can you tell the rest of us?
You know what? I'm not really hungry.
Me either.
My stomach's in a knot.
So's my neck.
I haven't been able to brush the back of my head in, like, a year and a half.
Spence, don't let Wilden freak you out.
Ok, if the police really knew that we were lying about the lake house--
not just the lake house.
What about the negatives of that picture,
Ali's missing body, all the things we buried with her--
any of that could get us arrested.
It's my neck again.
Are they going to Jenna's?
Garrett's.
Well, who else lives in his house besides his parents?
I don't think they've been outside since he was arrested.
Having a son in jail for two murders
might keep you indoors.
That's his mom. That's Mrs. Reynolds.
You guys.
What? What is it? What?
What?
There, over there.
There was a hoodie watching.
What are you saying?
You think "A" was out here watching us?
Are you sure?
Why, why would "A" care about Garrett's mother?
Maybe "A" wanted her out of the house.
Here's your bright-eye.
Oh. Thank you.
And the world's biggest bear claw.
What's in here?
They had that turkey baguette on the menu that you love.
You got me two of them.
And...roasted veggies and pickles.
Pickles come with.
Ah. Well, let me--
Oh, no. It's my treat.
What? You'll have something for later.
Okay, you have one lime in your fridge. One.
And it's growing fur.
Thank you, I appreciate it,
but you don't have to feed me.
I have my savings, my tutoring gigs--
I'm fine. Really.
It's just a turkey--
it's not necessary.
I have to get going. I have an interview at 8:30.
Hello? Still want a ride?
Yeah.
Please, just give me back my stuff!
Paige?
Hey, Emily. What's up?
I've been meaning to call you.
You have? Why?
I was wondering if you were free tomorrow night.
For?
I got tickets to see the Katy Perry movie.
Hanna's a big fan, but turns out she has other stuff going on.
Boy stuff.
Come on, a behind-the-scenes look at miss "firework."
Don't you want to know what makes her sizzle?
It'll be fun. You in?
I guess.
I haven't heard from you since--
I know. I've had a ton of makeup tests to do,
and senior year's been kicking my butt.
If you don't want to go--
No, I do.
That's not it.
I just thought you were avoiding me.
I wasn't avoiding you.
M-maybe I was, but not intentionally.
I've just been going through a lot
and needed to figure some stuff out.
Okay. Let's do it.
Fresh start, right?
Yeah.
You said tomorrow night?
You haven't heard?
She had more surgery before school.
She can see again.
I'm happy for her. It's pretty amazing.
Mrs. Welch was slobbering all over her in the parking lot.
Text me deets about Katy Perry.
See you tomorrow.
Congratulations.
Thanks.
Hey, what are you still doing here?
What are you still doing here?
I'm the mother. I get an answer first.
I don't feel well.
Have you heard from Caleb?
Do we know how his mother is?
I would if he'd respond to my texts.
Listen, I know you two left things unresolved.
It's resolved. He left me.
Hanna, that's just for right now.
Okay? You don't know what the future might hold.
But the future's not gonna hold much of anything
if you don't get an education. You need to go to school.
Do you have plans tomorrow?
Uh...yeah.
I'm going to listen to every sad song I've ever downloaded, on repeat.
My boss volunteered the bank staff to help out
at a rummage sale at the church.
We're still short a couple of people.
Oh, no, please don't.
It'll be fun.
You can help sort the clothes.
You love clothes.
New clothes.
Really?
Fine. Send me to church.
Hanna.
Gonna go to school wearing that?
Whatever.
Right.
What happened to keeping a low profile?
Staying blind because she's a target?
Look at her. How can you miss her?
She's been gliding around
school all day like a thanksgiving float.
We should say something to her.
No. Wait.
Did you get Aria's text about Lucas
and the photo studio?
Yeah. What was that about?
Aria says that she knows the photographer who owns the studio,
and it's on the same block
where she and Hanna saw Lucas on that night.
So now we think Lucas
took the photos in the graveyard?
Well, maybe, but then why was he pounding to get in there?
I can't think about this now. I have a calculus test.
Wait, Em. There's something else.
My mom left her tablet out on the table this morning.
What is this?
They're letting Garrett out.
To see his mother. It's called compassionate furlough.
What has he done to deserve compassion?
She's probably really sick.
So basically they're giving him a get-out-of-jail-free card?
This just might be his last time to say goodbye to her.
At least he gets a chance.
Do you want to talk about this later?
What's there to talk about?
We have no power-- who cares what we think?
I do.
What if "A" put Garrett's mom in the hospital
to get Garrett out of jail?
Maybe the plan is to meet
up with the person who's really helping him.
It would explain what Aria saw hiding in the shadows last night.
Em, Mona might not be the only person
in rosewood who owns a black hoodie.
Don't look. She's coming over here.
Who?
The float. She's carrying something. Envelopes.
What's in them?
Anthrax.
Hi. Here's one for you, and one for you.
I haven't seen Aria or Hanna.
Can I trust that you'll pass them on?
What is this?
Oh, they're invitations. It's my birthday.
And you recovered just in time.
The doctors say it's a positive outcome.
No. What the hell is this Jenna?
I thought you needed protection. We had a deal.
Well, this is the new deal:
I feel a lot safer when I'm in charge of what happens to me.
Hope to see you at the party.
Can you take a pot of decaf over to the alcove?
Oh, and please tell me you're free tomorrow night.
Why?
The guest list keeps expanding,
so might need you to work this birthday party.
Well, I can't, because I'm on the guest list.
Oh. That's perfect. You're already gonna be here anyway.
How often do you get paid to go to a party?
But I wasn't gonna come because I have other plans.
Well, they better include showing up here and keeping your job.
I thought I put the quinceanera photos in this book.
I need a sherpa.
Oh. Thanks, Emily. Have you met Laurel?
She's taking the pictures at my party.
Laurel Tuchman, this is Emily Fields.
We are... friends from school.
Cool. Listen, I'm sorry for the mess,
I always take up extra space.
Oh, no, no. Any more caffeine and my hair will straighten itself.
This is decaf.
Oh, well, then pour away.
Emily, would you mind just closing the curtain a little bit?
The light is still too much.
Sure.
Normally I would have had my assistant send all this over,
but I just got rid of him.
Note to self: don't hire a thief.
What happened?
Well, it's a long story.
He was stealing supplies, developing his own work.
Then he had the nerve to come back
and demand I give him his negatives.
I told him, "Listen, anything you left,
It belongs to me until you pay me what you owe me."
You know what's going on, right?
They're letting Garrett out.
He's gonna be free, walking down the street.
Not really. He'll be handcuffed, Nate.
There'll be a guard with him--
Since the court is gonna be so generous,
how about they grant me permission to...
Nate, stop.
Why aren't you angry?
I was. I am.
Look, I know he took away someone we both love,
but he's about to lose someone he loves, too.
So what?
He doesn't deserve to see the sky or breathe fresh air again.
I know. I'm with you on this, okay?
But you have to let things play out the way they're meant to be.
I'm on the clock, I have to get back to work.
Can you just hang out here for a bit?
You bought him groceries?
It was not groceries. It was two sandwiches.
And believe me, I'm still paying for it.
You should have seen the look he gave me.
Well, he's your boyfriend, Aria, he's not a baby squirrel.
Just trying to do the right thing.
Totally wrong.
I've been there, done that.
Every time you baby-squirrel Ezra
you're taking away his nuts.
You did not just say that.
I did. But I don't think that I meant to.
Is that Emily?
Ezra.
Did he find his nuts?
He just got an invitation to Jenna's birthday party.
Wait. Now Fitz is invited?
Yeah. Apparently Jenna wants to see her favorite teacher
for the first time.
What the hell is she up to?
Spencer, how are you able to write a paper during all this?
I'm not. I'm breaking and entering into my mom's email account.
Why?
Because I want to see what time garrett's being released.
You want to stand outside the hospital and protest?
No. I want to be inside, so I can see who he's really visiting.
And my guess is that face is gonna be a lot easier to read
under hospital lights than a street lamp.
Okay, great. Thanks.
They said we could use the Katy Perry movie
tickets next weekend instead.
I'm so embarrassed.
I invite you to do something, and then I cancel.
I'm sure it will be just as fun in seven days.
Besides, I get to see you tomorrow night anyway.
Yeah. Wearing this.
You bought a clip-on tie?
Kevin said the birthday girl was set on a certain look.
Fourth grade student council?
I'm not even sure how this works.
Can I help?
This is harder than it looks.
You know what, this is too short.
I have a real tie that I wore to a costume party.
Can you check that cabinet and see if it's in there?
Sure.
So, were you surprised that jenna invited you to this?
Kind of. We're not exactly chummy.
We were lab partners once, but she sorta scared me.
Is this yours?
What?
Careful, em. They're already pretty strong.
Oh, yeah. I-- I forgot that was in there.
It's nice.
It's a mistake.
I meant to toss it,
but I was afraid my mom would find it in the garbage.
There's still something in it.
Paige,
if you want it, it's yours.
Really. I'm done with that.
You sure you don't need a lift? It's not out of the way.
No, I'm good. I still have a few things to take care of here.
I will see you tomorrow.
Hmm. Must be great to say that and mean it.
Take care.
Thanks.
That's beautiful.
Thanks.
Are you an architecture student?
We'll see. Maybe someday.
Do you ever... draw people?
I have.
But, uh, they tend to look more like buildings.
Well, I'm impressed.
Well, where is my invitation? I want to at least see it.
Are you coming from yoga?
No, home.
Why are you dressed like that?
Because, Spencer,
I'm too depressed to work a zipper, all right? Get over it.
Who's she talking to?
Emily, who apparently has to work jenna's party.
Seriously?
Well, I can beat that.
I have to spend my saturday night
sorting out velour track suits at church.
Why? My mom found out that I cut school,
and now she signed me up for a triple shift.
If you thought I was depressed before...
It gets weirder.
What's up?
Hey, Han, how are you feeling?
I don't think I've seen you in sweats--
She can't work a zipper.
Just move on. What did Emily say?
So, Paige is invited to the party too,
and now Laurel Tuchman is shooting it.
Laura Tucks-what?
Laurel Tuchman.
The photographer that I took a class from last summer.
Go on.
Well, Emily may have overheard
why Lucas was banging on that door.
Laurel fired her assistant
because he was using the studio to develop his own prints.
And now he wants the negatives.
Where are you going with this?
To an open grave that he took pictures of.
And you think lucas dug it up by himself?
The kid can barely lift his chemistry book.
Well, he's tall enough to reach the pedals on a backhoe.
Let's just stay with Jenna, all right?
That's who Emily remembers driving that car that night.
Why can't she be it?
They can all be it.
Spencer's right.
Why is Garrett being released the same night of Jenna's party?
Exactly. What is the purpose of this party?
Is it really to celebrate Jenna's birthday,
or is it just to get us all in the same room
so she can drop a vat of pig's blood on us?
She's not dropping anything on me.
I won't be there. No one will.
Who wants to go to that stupid party anyways?
Me.
Wioh, am I done?
You've been here barely an hour.
That can't be true.
Just think of it as the school day you missed.
Have you eaten anything?
No.
That bra over there kind of put me off my feed.
They just put some food out. I'll see what I can find you.
I can't vouch for the egg salad,
but the peanut butter cookie: four stars.
Hmm. Thanks for the tip.
Here.
Thanks.
You on your way out?
I finished my shift earlier.
I just came back to check on my daughter.
Who's your daughter?
Hanna Marin. She's sorting clothes.
Oh, right. Yeah. She's a terrific worker.
Um, maybe I'm thinking of somebody else.
Yeah, maybe I am too.
You're with the group from the bank, right?
I am.
Yeah, this is an important cause for my boss.
We volunteer every year.
Well, we're grateful to have as many hands as possible.
I'm still new here, so just trying to get acquainted.
Well, you're name-tag says "Volunteer coordinator."
That's more than acquainted; that's committed...Ted.
Jumpin' in with both feet, I guess.
Good way to meet people... Ashley.
So is splitting a cookie with a stranger.
We're not strangers-- we split a cookie.
What does that make us if we split another?
Married?
Not yet, but I will.
If I can just bump into her, I will get some answers
about what Lucas was really doing in that studio.
Spence, I gotta go.
What are you doing?
You leave my lime alone.
I was just going to pet it.
You could do that,
or we could head over to New Hope and hang out before dinner.
We're going to dinner in new hope?
Yeah, is that a problem?
No...no.
I just thought that we would go
somewhere around here so we could stop by Jenna's party.
I thought I mentioned that to you.
You did, but I-- I didn't think you were serious.
I don't have to go to that party, and neither do you.
I know I don't, but I'd like to.
Really? Given your history with her?
That's exactly what it is: history.
You were the first one to say that, anyway.
Look, it's incredible what she's gone through,
and if she wants to include me--us--
It's the least we can do to be there.
That's it. I can't wait.
Wait for what?
This.
Open it.
They don't make these cameras anymore,
and it's kind of indestructible, so it probably still works.
But--
But nothing.
You're welcome.
Thank you.
Come on. Let's go to a party.
Okay, so he's finally chosen some flowers,
which are hideous and tacky and mostly carnations,
But there's not really much selection around here.
Is he handcuffed at least?
Yeah. And he has two guards with him.
Hold on.
What's happening?
He's writing a note for the flowers.
Why would he be doing that?
So she'll know who they're from.
His mom is in a coma. She's not doing a lot of reading.
I gotta go.
Fine.
Uh, I'll call you later. Bye, dad.
I get it.
He's despicable and he's hurt people who were close to you.
But his mother's dying. That's her son.
So two guards weren't enough? They had to send you too?
I've still got a missing body to find.
It's my job, not yours.
What are you looking for?
I'm just here to pick up the...test results
of my field hockey physical.
You know what? You used to be a much better liar.
Nice tie.
Thanks. I can't wait to take it off.
When you do, can you wrap it for me?
I forgot to bring a gift.
I'm glad you're here.
I wanted to make sure this night wasn't a complete bust for you.
Who's that?
Nate.
M-maya's cousin.
I'll take that.
I'll be right back.
You've been here a while. You want to take a break?
Can I be done?
You could, but if you're taking that jacket with you...
Oh. No, I was gonna buy that.
Here. Do I pay you? I only have a twenty.
I'll get your receipt.
Wait. Um, do you know where this last box of clothes came from?
I don't.
Why? Does it matter?
No. I was just curious.
Em, call me. I'm still at the church,
and I just found--
I thought that you and Spencer got rid of all of your clothes--
The gray jacket from that night?
It just came out of a donation box. Why is it here?
Nate. What are you--
I was hoping you were gonna be working tonight.
Were you invited to this?
Last minute invitation.
I met Jenna here yesterday afternoon.
I figure it was either come to this or sit in my empty apartment
and punch holes in the wall.
Truth is, I don't know how long I'll stay.
I'm not in the mood to party.
But I gotta say, she's pretty intriguing.
Why? What did she tell you?
Enough to get me to buy a new shirt.
I want to know more.
No, you don't.
What does that mean?
Nothing.
I should probably pass these around before they dry out.
What are those?
Dried out.
Hi! You made it.
I was...flattered for the invitation.
We both were.
Happy birthday.
I'm sorry, I don't mean to stare.
I'm just still adjusting and trying to match faces in reality
to the ones that I saw in my head.
No, it must be overwhelming.
Is that Laurel Tuchman?
She's the photographer I took a class from last summer.
She's amazing.
I didn't want to leave it to amateurs.
I wanted someone who could record every single moment.
I'm gonna go say hi. I'll be right back.
Laurel?
Hey, Aria.
This girl's got some classy friends. How ya doin'?
I'm good. Yeah, I'm still taking pictures.
Actually, my boyfriend, he just
gave me this vintage camera. It's a Rolleiflex.
God, nice boyfriend. When I was I high school,
I couldn't afford a pinhole and a light bulb.
Oh, he's not in high school.
Are those expensive?
Honey, if it works, he must have dropped a precious penny on it.
Listen, I'd love to stay and chat, but I gotta keep snapping.
I'm flying solo.
Are you here alone without an assistant?
Don't ask.
I'm in the market if you know anyone who's interested.
I'm interested.
Really?
Yeah. Well, call me on monday. Hopefully by then
I'll have gotten rid of what's left of the old one.
Is he still there?
Well, just his camera bag.
I'm holding it hostage till
he gets mommy and daddy to write me a check.
Hey! Need some help?
I wish, but you can't.
My manager sees me hanging, he'll freak out.
He wasn't upset you were hanging out with Maya's cousin?
Nate?
No, we weren't hanging out.
We were just--
It's complicated.
Hi, Paige.
Hi.
What's up?
Nothing. We'll talk later.
You know, I'm leaving.
I shouldn't really be back here anyway.
It's a no-friend zone.
What are you looking for?
Laurel's equipment. She said it was back here.
Yeah, it's right there.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?!
I'm getting into her studio tonight.
方便的时候给我电话
Toby. Hey, what are you doing here?
Your parents were on their way out. They let me in.
What's wrong?
I thought that by getting my own place above the brew
that I could escape my screwed-up family.
Right. And it does not help
when they throw birthday parties right below you.
Do your parents expect you to make an appearance
at this coming-out-of-the-dark party?
They can expect all they want.
I'll wait for the she's-leaving-Rosewood party.
I'm gonna throw you that party.
Are you okay with me barging in like this?
I mean, did you have plans?
I, um, I did, actually.
I just have this really big French test coming up.
I have to read that massive book.
Which means that you should totally stay.
Good. That's what I was hoping you'd say.
Toby.
How is it possible that you and I are the only two people
that know that Jenna was faking for so long?
I think most people want to buy into a happy ending.
Yeah, but your parents-- how did she fool them?
I mean, they were living in the same house.
Did they just not notice that she was able to see?
Did she sleep with her sunglasses on?
She told my parents a few weeks ago
that she started seeing
shadows over the summer, and then blurry figures.
And they just bought that she
didn't mention this in her letters home from camp?
She said she was scared--
Scared that it might suddenly go back to darkness
and she'd have to live with everyone pitying her even more.
It's so weird.
What?
That the most honest person I know has to share parents
with the most deceitful person in this town.
Can we not discuss that person?
Hey, where have you been?
Bathroom. Everything okay?
You kind of ditched me back there.
With Jenna. So can we go?
No. I don't want to be rude.
Jenna can see now,
she'll know we left before the cake.
We are not staying for cake. We have a dinner reservation.
Just a couple more minutes.
Emily had to tell me something.
Can you wait one second?
What are you doing?!
Looking for a coconut.
These vanilla ones are gross.
Would you please stop?
I'm gonna stop till I find a coconut.
Paige. Can I get you some coffee?
Is she drunk?
No, I'm not drunk, I'm hungry.
And your cupcakes taste like old pennies.
Paige, you and I--
Oh. Really?
Finally, you have time for me?
All right, let's dance. Let's dance.
I can't dance right now. I'm working.
Fine. I'll dance by myself.
Are you okay?
Are you okay? Oh, my gosh.
Can somebody get some ice, please?
Everybody back up.
Are you okay? Don't move. Be careful.
Is she one of your friends?
Yes.
We should get her out of here.
Okay, come on.
Hannah.
Hey. Where's Paige?
Getting stitches. Um, this is Nate,
Maya's cousin.
Hi.
Hey.
Nate, would you mind getting us some coffee?
They said it was gonna be a while.
Yeah.
Thanks.
I thought spencer was here.
She was.
She bumped into Wilden and he scared her off.
This was at the church?
Is it yours?
Mine had a rip in the pocket that I sewed with a pink--
thread.
This is mine.
Well, it hasn't been anywhere near a fire.
How did this get to the rummage sale?
That can't be a coincidence.
Spencer was right -- this "A" definitely has an agenda.
When did you take it off that night?
Because you didn't have it on at the graveyard, Emily.
When we found you you were shivering.
I know I wore it to Spencer's house. That's all I remember.
Did you have it in Jenna's car?
Did you leave it there?
Because if she's our pal now,
why didn't she just give it back to you?
I don't know. Maybe...
maybe Jenna wasn't the only person I saw that night.
It's my mom.
I've got to get back to the church
or I'll be sorting old pantyhose for the rest of my life.
Hey. Where's your friend?
Uh, she had to go meet her mom.
Forgot to ask how you take it.
Put cream in both of them.
Thanks.
Oh. Can I help you?
Oh. Yeah, I-I was just looking for Emily.
She took her friend to the hospital,
and left me holding all of the cupcakes.
I'm sure she's gonna be back.
I'm not.
Excuse me.
Aria. What is going on?
Uh...someone said that they just put out some stuffed mushrooms.
I don't want a mushroom. I want a dinner.
I know. And we will leave soon.
Are we hanging out here because
you don't want to have this meal?
I can afford to take you dinner, Aria.
It's not necessary. You just bought me an expensive camera.
What does that have to do with it?
You're spending money that you don't have.
I do have it.
I chose the restaurant in New Hope because I wanted to celebrate.
Celebrate what?
The job I got today.
You got that editing job? Why didn't you tell me?
I thought it'd be nicer at a private table
where we're not surrounded by people with silly hats.
Oh, crap!
Everything okay?
It's all wet!
I don't have one dry memory card!
Who's been using my equipment as a coaster?!
I could run to your studio and grab you a couple more.
I can't ask you to do that.
You're not asking, I'm offering. Where are your keys?
You're a doll. And you're officially hired.
Tell her to take the job.
Okay. Her studio's down the street, and we'll be right back.
I'll call the restaurant and cancel the reservation.
No, don't. Please.
Just call them up, ask them to hold it for a little bit longer.
I will be right back.
玫瑰镇高中年鉴大厅通行证
Lucas.
I need to get inside.
Uh, studio's closed.
Leave the door open and walk away.
I can't do that.
Then drop the keys and let me find them.
Lucas, get out of my way.
Aria.
Lucas. What's going on?
Is everything okay here?
Did you get what you needed?
Mind if I ask you a question?
Is Paige just a friend, or something more?
We dated for a while.
Was that before Maya, or after?
It was kind of in between.
I'll be right back.
You get my text?
Why do you think I'm here? Let's go upstairs.
No, I can't.
Nate's here and Paige is coming out any moment.
But if Wilden left
that probably means Garrett left too.
And we have to see what's on the card he stuck in those flowers.
Hey! Garrett!
No! Nate, stop!
Hey! Get off me!
Let me go!
Get off!
You didn't have to stay.
I wanted to. You were in there for a long time.
They gave me a few stitches, and they wanted to run a test.
Why?
I told the doctor how little I had to drink,
and he wanted to do a tox screen.
Turns out I wasn't messed up from the alcohol.
What do you mean?
There were traces of milizopam in my system.
It's a sleeping pill.
The doctor asked if I set my cup down at any point
or drank from someone else's.
Honestly, who knows?
It's such a blur. I don't remember anything.
I need to call my parents.
My dad's gonna want to talk to the doctor.
Here.
I don't want that on me when they get here.
我也不会放弃你的 - 爱你 加勒特
Are you home yet?
I'm still at Ezra's. He's in the shower.
Call me when you get home.
That might be a while.
Why? What's going on?
Well, I basically ditched him at Jenna's party,
so I'm trying to smooth the waters.
Have you looked at the negatives yet?
I'm doing it now. It's my first chance.
What are you typing?
I'm looking up milizopam.
Is Paige gonna be okay?
She'll be fine until she realizes the drugs came from my flask.
It looks like these first two rolls are just yearbook stuff.
"Milizopam. A strong sedative prescribed for sleep disorders.
Also used to subdue aggressive patients and inmates."
Go on.
There's a list of side effects when mixed with alcohol.
Top of the list, memory loss.
You were totally screwed with.
Was that flask ever out of your sight that night?
It was probably in there before I got to Spencer's.
Yeah, but why just you? Why weren't we all drugged?
Maybe that was the plan, Aria.
Lucky I wasn't in the mood to share that night.
Em...
Does it say anything about what those pills look like?
"Light blue and oval-shaped."
With the letters M-Z-M on them?
Yeah. How'd you know?
I'm holding three of them...
and they were in Lucas's camera bag.
