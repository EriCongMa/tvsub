oh , god !
how &apos;s she doing ?
she &apos;s was little agitated this morning ,
but i gave her a sedative .
does she know i &apos;m coming ?
yes , but it &apos;s been a year .
i &apos;m sure she doesn &apos;t want to go back over this .
how long will it take ?
3 , 4 hours , tops .
because i have to prep her for trial .
i didn &apos;t think profilers did that .
profiling is only one @-@ tenth of what we do .
we also assist the prosecution once we find the killers .
agent morgan . hi .
ellen . how are you ?
good .
daria is really improving .
it &apos;s amazing .
if all goes well ,
they say i can take her home after the trial .
let &apos;s just get through this first .
this way .
daria . you got a friend here .
remember agent morgan ?
i &apos;ll leave you two alone .
thank you .
how you doing ?
how do you think ?
i &apos;m sure it &apos;s been hard .
look , can we just get this over with ?
today we &apos;re going to talk about what your testimony will be .
and i &apos;m going to tell you how our investigation has progressed
to prepare you for your cross @-@ examination , all right ?
all right , let &apos;s talk about the weekend that you escaped .
what do you remember ?
i remember ben .
ben .
when was the last time that you saw him ?
i was over by the window
when they took ben out .
so you knew that they were gonna hurt him .
carrie and i waited by the door for ben ,
but when they came back , he wasn &apos;t with them .
do you know what happened to him ?
yes , i do .
straighten it out . straighten it out .
hold it steady . relax your arms .
you &apos;re holding on a little too tight .
you &apos;re doing it .
relax .
enjoy the ride .
this is a lucky man &apos;s work .
dad , what the hell ?
what ? what--oh , stop , stop , stop .
i knew it would be bad .
every time i think about it , i just want to kill myself .
i should have done something to stop them .
no , daria . there &apos;s nothing you could have done .
that was our job .
3 victims have been found in upstate new york
in a town called hamilton over the past 10 days .
all of the bodies were discovered in a sort of public place ,
the first on a dead @-@ end street ,
the second in a desolate alley ,
and this is the last one-- in a field .
dorothy , we &apos;re not in kansas anymore .
although each victim was abducted from a neighboring city ,
they all have something in common .
yikes .
28 puncture wounds to the chest in groups of 4 .
looks like it was made by a 4 @-@ pronged hay fork
or some other kind of farming equipment .
only the latest victim was displayed like that .
the first two were unceremoniously dumped .
the display method and the disposal
suggests the unsub &apos;s evolving .
he wanted them to be found .
perhaps it &apos;s some kind of warning .
it could be a deity symbol .
in a japanese book from the year 712 called &quot; kojiki , &quot;
the scarecrow is seen as a symbol of
someone who knew everything in the world .
i &apos;m more concerned with the m.o.
is this piqueristic or flat @-@ out sadistic ?
it could be a combo platter , with a side order of psycho .
his pace and determination mean he &apos;s going to kill again soon .
let &apos;s go to new york . wheels up in 30 .
after they dumped ben , how were they acting ?
they were drinking .
they always drank after they got rid of a body .
how many bodies were there ?
i don &apos;t know .
i stopped counting .
what did they do with you and carrie after that ?
they put us in the shed .
that &apos;s when carrie had the idea .
we gotta run .
are you crazy ?
they &apos;re probably passed out by now .
no . they &apos;re still up .
then we wait until they go to bed .
look ...
i got this earlier .
carrie ...
as soon as i get the door open , we have got to make a run for it .
daria , joe is evil .
if we don &apos;t do this now , they &apos;re gonna kill us .
you know this .
we waited two hours ,
until we thought it was safe .
they must have heard a noise .
that didn &apos;t stop us , though .
we ran and ran .
looky here .
we got runners .
daria !
carrie !
no , please don &apos;t leave me ! don &apos;t leave me !
i &apos;m sorry !
daria !
i &apos;m sorry !
ohh ! oh , daria , don &apos;t leave me !
the edge of winter
&quot; no one is ever a victim ,
although your conquerors
would have you believed in your own victimhood .
how else could they conquer you ? &quot;
barbara marciniak .
how far did you run ?
i don &apos;t know . i just kept going .
then i got to the edge of the road .
do you have a girlfriend ?
yes , i do .
i used to have a boyfriend .
i miss him .
daria ?
when you ran , weren &apos;t you afraid they might find you ?
yeah . but i was hoping someone else would find me first .
where were you ?
we were on our way .
these 3 victims vary in age
and were last seen in various public locations on different days .
our unsub clearly employs an abduction method
that works with both men and women .
the female victims had signs of sexual assault
while the male did not .
that means the rapes are situational .
he also knew where to stab the victims
without killing them right away .
piquerism is usually sexual in nature ,
and it &apos;s not often found in mixed gender victimology .
he &apos;s probably a sadist who &apos;s getting immense pleasure
from his victims &apos; suffering .
guys , i just found out that the second victim ,
chloe reynolds , she &apos;s muslim .
the first victim , marlene , is black .
maybe the most recent killing is a hate crime ,
similar to matthew shepard .
garcia , do we know ben &apos;s sexual orientation ?
i &apos;ll start digging .
so after you escaped and started running , what were you thinking ?
i wanted to go back for carrie .
i couldn &apos;t do that .
why not ? what did you think was happening ?
i knew she &apos;d be punished for what we did .
please !
you were gonna run ? ! huh ?
he &apos;d blame her for the escape .
please ...
i--i told her not to .
no , you didn &apos;t .
this was your idea .
no , it wasn &apos;t .
all your idea !
when joe got mad , was he always out of control ?
what did he do to you ?
i need the details , daria .
he &apos;d punch us so hard , we couldn &apos;t see for a week .
he &apos;d tie us to the radiator .
god , i hated that radiator .
help me ! help me !
so you knew there was no way you could go back to help carrie .
how could i ?
you saw what they did to ben .
they would have done that to me .
so this is where ben was hung .
i don &apos;t see any blood .
crime scene &apos;s incredibly neat .
the scarecrow looks like it was gently placed .
it &apos;s quite a distance from the road , too .
there aren &apos;t any tire tracks
to suggest he drove a vehicle out here .
how much do you think ben weighed ?
a buck 75 , maybe .
ok , so , our unsub parks his vehicle ,
carries a mutilated guy
who &apos;s practically dead weight through a field ,
strings him up like a scarecrow , alone ,
and no one sees anything .
i &apos;m not buying .
you think he had help .
he couldn &apos;t have done it alone .
he must &apos;ve had a partner .
hey there , joe , you got everything you need ?
could be snow , ice .
i got ropes , chains , ammonia to clean up , and ice picks .
you and your ice picks . you sure you don &apos;t want me to come ?
you always take care of this stuff . i got this one .
you need me , i &apos;ll meet you up there in a couple days .
you &apos;re going on a road trip , carrie .
were the markings similar on everyone ?
2 @-@ millimeter holes , almost 1.27 centimeters apart .
there are microscopic differences
in the distances between the wounds .
this one &apos;s one millimeter shorter .
this is not the work of a hay fork or a farming implement .
the holes are too small .
i think it &apos;s most likely an ice pick .
so the killers carefully jab the ice pick
into the skin to set the pattern .
exactly . then they replicated it on the other victims .
the unsubs would have had to stand over the body
during the torture .
it &apos;s actually quite masterful .
whoever did this was extremely controlled .
add that to the neatness of the crime scene ,
i think we &apos;re looking for someone with ocd .
the precision is astounding .
you guys were right .
joe was messy .
he made his friend keep things neat .
can you give me an example ?
the table was always scrubbed .
the ice picks were scrubbed , too .
every drop of blood was cleaned from the floor .
every day they would tell us how they would kill us .
... chop his head off .
they had sick minds .
no .
we could try .
we could . slice &apos; em up , scatter them around town .
no .
i want to do something freaky .
you know ?
really make a statement .
sick , hateful minds .
that &apos;s probably why we originally thought this was a hate crime .
i just talked to ben &apos;s sister ,
and according to her , he wasn &apos;t gay .
we &apos;re not looking at another matthew shepard situation .
and the second victim &apos;s parents said
that she was not a practicing muslim .
garcia , have you found any connection at all between the victims ?
they have about as much in common as dinosaurs and goldfish .
the cracker kind .
then they might be victims of opportunity .
found another vic . she was badly abused .
where did they find the body ?
oh , she &apos;s not dead .
she got hit by a car last night . she &apos;s been in the e.r.
a cop that had heard the chest wounds
and made the connection .
call you back , garcia .
bp &apos;s 80 over 30 .
give me two large @-@ bore ivs , wide open .
i &apos;m agent jareau . what is your name ?
please , help us .
us ? are there other girls ?
they &apos;re coming after us .
find carrie .
carrie . who &apos;s carrie ?
who &apos;s carrie ?
we &apos;re losing blood .
sorry , guys .
give me etomidate .
let &apos;s move back to surgery .
there &apos;s another girl .
and she said &quot; they . &quot;
which confirms we were right about a team .
with one girl escaping , carrie &apos;s probably in extreme danger .
or the unsubs are panicking and they &apos;re looking for someone else .
joe liked bars .
that &apos;s usually where he &apos;d find girls .
where would he find guys ?
anywhere he could .
but he had a way with women .
he &apos;d charm us .
tell us we were
smart , pretty , funny .
well , it was really fun talking to you .
where you goin &apos; ?
car &apos;s in the shop . i &apos;m walkin &apos; it .
you want a ride ?
ok .
then when we woke up , we wouldn &apos;t know what had happened .
do you remember what happened the day we found you ?
i remember doctors , nurses ,
nothing else .
our jane doe is stable .
she suffered severe trauma from the car accident
as well as the torture .
there are also signs of long @-@ term sexual assault .
and wounds on her wrists that have healed .
so she &apos;d been held for a while .
yes . and she &apos;s experiencing retrograde amnesia .
she only remembers snippets about her past .
is this from the accident or the abuse ?
probably a combination of both .
time may restore memory .
questions can jog it .
it &apos;s important that we talk to her .
you can try .
all right . i &apos;ll head back in .
do you remember what happened
when we came in that hospital room to talk to you again ?
nope . i just remember i was upset .
he hit me again ! carrie !
i &apos;m so sorry . i &apos;m so sorry , ok ?
i promise i &apos;ll come back for you . i &apos;m gonna send somebody !
i left you , but they &apos;re gonna find you !
carrie !
we just want to ask you a few questions , ok ?
aah ! don &apos;t touch me !
we &apos;re not here to hurt you .
it &apos;s ok .
look at me . look at me .
you are ok .
listen , in order for us to help you or carrie ,
we need to ask you some questions .
do you remember your name ?
just find carrie .
we will . we will .
but right now we need to help you .
you want that , don &apos;t you ?
we &apos;ve got to get her picture out .
i &apos;m just afraid no one &apos;s going to recognize her ,
she &apos;s so beat up .
we &apos;ll improvise . i &apos;ll call local p.d.
and get a forensic artist .
do you think one of the unsubs is a woman ?
she freaked out on me , not you .
that didn &apos;t happen when she first met you .
but with improving memory ,
you may have reminded her of carrie .
yeah , she did look like carrie .
same hair , same smile .
you know , they could have picked anyone ,
but they picked me .
i was going to be a doctor .
help people .
now i got doctors poking at me all day .
why did they go from dumping their victims
to displaying them ?
i don &apos;t know .
do you think it &apos;s because
they wanted the public to see their work ?
why are you asking me that ?
because of how we found our next victim .
she was discovered hanging in a rest stop bathroom .
do we know her name ?
still checking , but our unsubs are getting bolder .
their disposal sites have gone from remote and rural
to high @-@ traffic areas .
same signature , but the puncture wounds
are bigger than the other ones ,
and they aren &apos;t the same distance apart .
i think they used a different ice pick .
the wounds look deeper and more forceful , too .
they &apos;re continuing to display the bodies ,
which means they want everyone to see their handiwork .
yet the ocd &apos;s not present
in the wound patterns or at the crime scene .
maybe they &apos;re losing control and devolving .
or they know we have jane doe
and now their rage is already out of control .
there are also indicators of sexual assault .
let &apos;s get that photo to morgan and jj at the hospital .
this could be the carrie that the jane doe &apos;s been going on about .
and that &apos;s when i showed you a picture of this woman .
i &apos;ve never met this woman .
that &apos;s not carrie .
i know .
but that &apos;s why we had to get our profile out fast .
we believe we &apos;re looking for a pair of sadistic killers
who are trying to terrorize the community by torturing
and displaying their victims .
one of the partners is dominant
and fulfilling an emotional need .
the other is submissive
and displays obsessive @-@ compulsive tendencies .
we believe the stabbing in the chest is symbolic
of unfulfilled sexual desire .
their m.o. is deteriorating , and this is evidenced by the fact
that for the first time a victim successfully escaped .
so they &apos;re improvising now ,
breaking their own rules and becoming even more reckless .
this could cause a rift in the partnership ,
and it may result in changes
or escalation to the torturous behavior .
now , we do have one hospitalized victim ,
but her abuse and length of captivity ,
along with the injuries sustained in the car accident ,
have left her in a dissociative state .
at this point , we believe she was held for at least 10 months ,
which is much longer than any of the other victims .
this means that she held a very special place
in the dominant unsub &apos;s fantasies .
losing her will only increase his anger .
that &apos;s why he feels compelled to display his victims
in a more public way .
he wants others to feel the full force of his outrage .
also , since another victim was found within the last two hours ,
we believe the kills are accelerating .
oh . you liked him , huh ?
no ! no !
watch .
watch !
no , please !
i could have stopped them .
i could have stopped this .
you did , daria .
getting your i.d. let to a break in the case .
don &apos;t you remember that ?
no .
no .
yes .
finding out who you were
opened everything up .
this is the area where the bodies are being dropped .
it &apos;s basically a 10 @-@ mile radius .
but the hunting zone extends another 20 miles .
probably lives somewhere in there .
the police captain just called from brooklyn .
says she recognized our jane doe .
her name is daria samsen .
they &apos;re sending a relative now .
what &apos;s their relationship ?
it &apos;s her sister . she &apos;s on the next train up .
about a year ago ,
daria was a med student at cornell .
she went to work one day and just vanished .
we looked everywhere .
put up flyers , billboards .
i thought she was murdered .
when was the last time you saw her ?
the day she went missing .
i dropped her off at work .
she had a part @-@ time job at a diner .
she would ... she would hook me up with coffee .
do you remember anything strange about that day ?
what was the weather like ?
it was cold . it was very cold .
when we headed to the door , we walked by a truck .
was there anyone inside of it ?
there was this guy . a white guy .
did he say anything ?
he just looked at daria and he said ...
you &apos;re about as pretty as a stack of new 100s .
what did he look like ?
he was built . good @-@ looking .
probably mid @-@ 30s .
did your sister say anything to him ?
she smiled back at him .
he told her he was waiting for his mom who was in ...
my mother &apos;s in physical therapy across the street .
... physical therapy across the street .
was there anything identifiable on the truck ?
bumper stickers . decals .
uh , it was-- it was blue .
kind of dingy .
is that all you can see ? think back .
i can see part of his license plate .
uh , 543l ...
but i hear a dispatcher .
what is the dispatcher saying ?
we got a broken furnace at ridley and west .
there was a broken furnace .
yes .
yes . there &apos;s a joe bachner of conway electric .
pulling up his records now .
booyah , this is our guy .
what &apos;s his background ?
he is a member of the upright citizens brigade ,
he says with biting sarcasm .
in and out of jail , for battery , 15 years ago .
once accused of kidnapping a woman ,
but then she dropped the charges .
we were pretty sure that joe was one of our guys ,
but we just needed you to i.d. him to be sure .
daria ?
daria .
hey , it &apos;s me .
listen , i need to show you another picture .
do you know who this is ?
daria , do you know this man ?
get ...
get him away from me .
get him away from me .
daria ... daria , honey .
honey , i &apos;m here .
you i.d.ing joe helped us get his address
and led us straight to his place .
yeah ...
but you got the story wrong .
how ?
that &apos;s exactly what you told me a year ago , daria .
yeah , but i remember more now .
joe didn &apos;t abduct me in front of the diner .
i got into his truck willingly .
what are you saying ?
he seemed nice .
after work , joe took me out for dinner .
the next thing i knew , i woke up ...
in the shed and i was all--all tied up .
joe used a ruse . he did that with everyone .
did they all fall in love with him ?
no ?
that &apos;s what i thought .
i liked being there .
i let him touch me
and then i wouldn &apos;t get beat .
i kissed him .
i liked it .
it &apos;s my fault !
this is all my fault .
daria just told me
that she got into the car with joe voluntarily .
that &apos;s all right . she &apos;ll still be a sympathetic witness .
she said she fell in love with him , hotch .
we &apos;ll explain that it &apos;s stockholm syndrome ,
but i need to know if there are any more surprises .
all right , i &apos;m about to go back in there .
i just wanted to give her a break .
it &apos;s critical that we get all the details of her testimony .
i know .
all right .
let &apos;s get back to where we were .
once we got joe &apos;s i.d. , we headed to the house .
blake and reid .
we went out to that house
and we searched the place and it was empty .
clear !
clear !
clear !
and after we dug deeper into joe &apos;s background ,
we still couldn &apos;t figure out who his partner was .
nothing out back .
he &apos;s burned papers , clothes .
the shed &apos;s been completely ammonia &apos;d down .
checked the basement . clean as a whistle .
well , if he &apos;s not here , maybe he &apos;s with the partner .
garcia , where else has joe worked
besides conway electric ?
he &apos;s had random construction jobs over the last two years .
and what do we know about his background ?
raised in pennsylvania .
his parents died in a car accident .
where &apos;d he go after that ?
his juvie records are sealed with crazy glue .
but it looks like he was sent away
to live with his alcoholic nurse aunt ,
who makes mommie dearest look like a saint .
according to reports , she locked him in a shed ,
didn &apos;t feed him for days ,
siccing bees on him when she was mad .
get away !
please ! stop it !
that &apos;s how social services found him when he got to school .
hundreds of beestings on his chest .
so those torture wounds copied the stings .
it also explains the display method of his last two victims .
he wants to show the world the horrors
of what he was forced to endure as a child .
and daria was a medical student .
so we were she &apos;s a surrogate for joe &apos;s aunt .
where &apos;s the aunt now ?
uh , she died february 2012 .
a month before daria was abducted .
so the aunt &apos;s death was the trigger .
any known associates ? we need to find the partner .
looks like he hangs out
with local biker dudes and former cellmates .
compile a list . we &apos;ll run this by daria at the hospital .
yes . yes . bad people make bad people . bye .
you said there was another man with joe .
do you remember that ?
i &apos;m not sure .
all right .
you were hesitant back then , too .
daria , this is important .
who else was in that shed ?
no . no ! no !
no , let me go !
no , please ! please !
hurry up , coby !
we don &apos;t have all day .
coby .
his name &apos;s coby .
oh , god .
it &apos;s ok , honey .
you &apos;re ok .
i don &apos;t want to do this anymore .
i know .
it was coby .
i know . shh .
i cross @-@ checked the name coby with the guys in the biker gang .
i &apos;m coming up empty there .
try men released from prison with whom he might have done time .
ok ...
bada @-@ bing bada @-@ boom , the floodgates are opening .
there &apos;s a coby peters . he was released a year before joe .
he lives about 3 miles away . he &apos;s a part @-@ time electrician ,
full @-@ time alcoholic .
that &apos;s our guy .
let &apos;s go . thanks , garcia .
fbi !
clear !
clear !
hotch .
look . he took all his guns .
look at this place .
this guy &apos;s the one with ocd .
go ahead , garcia .
sir , i got a ping off coby peters &apos; credit card .
he &apos;s around the corner at mike &amp; sons .
coby peters , fbi !
fbi !
don &apos;t move !
let &apos;s talk about coby .
tell me about him .
he was evil .
you must have seen how mean coby was .
he wasn &apos;t what we expected .
i didn &apos;t kill anyone .
we have 4 bodies , coby . you &apos;re part of a team .
what team ? i &apos;m an electrician .
who used to be a medical tech .
is that how you learned to torture like this ?
what the hell is this ?
i thought you brought me in here for the guns .
we don &apos;t care about the guns . what about daria ?
you know her ?
we &apos;re getting warmer , aren &apos;t we ?
looks familiar , doesn &apos;t she ?
except you didn &apos;t kill this one ,
because she &apos;s laying up in a hospital room
with torture wounds all over her body .
that &apos;s my friend &apos;s girl .
who &apos;s your friend ?
joe bachner .
she come around when we were playing poker .
what happened to her ?
you tell us .
how should i know ?
what &apos;s your relationship with your friend ?
he &apos;s my drinking buddy , and he works for me from time to time .
when was the last time you saw him ?
i went to his house to give him the keys to my client &apos;s cabin .
water heater broke . he said he &apos;d fix it .
how was he acting ?
fine . he was packing up his car .
did he have anyone with him ?
just some equipment and ...
ice picks .
look , if joe hurt these people , go talk to him .
he &apos;s still up at my client &apos;s cabin .
he seems forthcoming .
it could be the behavior of an innocent or a psychopath .
you know , i know his house was clean ,
but did you see his shirt and shoes ?
they were messy . there &apos;s no way this guy is ocd .
i find it interesting that daria never asked coby for help .
she was there when they played poker .
maybe she couldn &apos;t because she was still under joe &apos;s control .
we searched coby &apos;s home . nothing connected to the crime .
let &apos;s head up to that cabin .
you kids ready to have some more fun ?
please don &apos;t .
no !
come on , just let us go .
let you go . let you go ? !
you think i brought you all the way up here just to let you go ?
joe bachner , fbi !
we need medics .
you can &apos;t outrun a bullet , joe !
tell us where your partner is , joe . who is he ?
that &apos;s why i came back to the hospital
to talk to you ,
because we were trying to find out who joe &apos;s partner was .
your sister didn &apos;t want us to bother you again ,
but she knew we were desperate .
we &apos;re looking for a team and we have to find both of them .
they could have more girls right now .
every minute counts .
do you remember what you said ?
yeah . it &apos;s coming back .
it was coby .
are you sure , daria ?
yeah , it was him .
i need you to think back .
we were in the shed . he had an ice pick .
ok . ok . and what was he doing with it ?
joe and coby were about to hurt ben .
and you &apos;re sure it was coby ?
look at his face again .
it &apos;s too blurry . i can &apos;t see .
keep looking , daria .
yeah , it was coby . i &apos;m telling you .
he , uh , started poking holes in ben .
he put the ice pick in a box .
where did they put this box ?
on a shelf .
in the house .
blake ?
yeah , what &apos;s up ?
i think i figured it out .
check every shelf in that house for a wooden box .
what &apos;s in the box ?
the answer to this case .
so i had blake search that house
for that ice pick in a box ,
and then i presented that box to you .
is that coming back to you ?
yeah . yeah .
is that it ?
yes , it is .
we found it in joe &apos;s bedroom .
was the ice pick in there ?
yes , daria .
along with some of your things .
the reason joe hung on to carrie
is because after you escaped , he needed another partner .
what ?
what are you talking about ?
often when someone &apos;s held captive ,
they &apos;re forced to do the unthinkable .
your prints were found on that ice pick , daria .
i wasn &apos;t coby who put the holes in those victims .
it was you .
what ? you &apos;re -- you &apos;re wrong .
no , i &apos;m not .
agent morgan -- - ellen , just listen .
these are facts .
daria , you &apos;re the one with ocd .
you &apos;re the one who kept that place clean .
joe forced you to participate .
and he made you clean up after his crimes .
it &apos;s how he controlled you , daria .
and to deal with the pain , your mind had just snapped .
it let you think that it was someone else
who was participating , his friend coby .
it &apos;s ... it &apos;s not true .
not true .
sorry , but it is . it is . he made you do it .
do it !
no ! no !
do it or i &apos;ll kill her . now !
no ! no !
daria , it &apos;s not your fault .
do you hear me ? it &apos;s not your fault .
no !
you had no choice .
no !
it &apos;s not your fault .
daria , baby ...
no ! no !
i loved him .
that &apos;s why i did those things .
after a while , he didn &apos;t even have to ask me to do it .
i just ... i just did it .
wait a minute .
did you torture people on your own ?
that &apos;s what he wanted .
he loved me .
he kept me for a whole year .
the other ones he just had for a few weeks .
daria , would you hurt someone again if joe asked you to ?
if he wanted .
he &apos;s my boyfriend .
i loved him .
i still love him .
excuse me , but it &apos;s time for daria to take her medicine .
ok .
we &apos;re done .
daria ...
i &apos;m gonna step outside and speak with your sister .
how did it go ?
unfortunately , there is no way that the government
can call your sister as a witness .
wait , what ?
that was the deal . if she doesn &apos;t testify ,
she goes to jail .
daria admitted to me that at some point
she became a willing participant in the murders ,
and she said she would do it again .
i don &apos;t believe that .
your sister is mentally incapacitated ,
and i am protecting her by not letting her take that stand .
but then they will keep her in here forever .
my sister is not crazy .
ellen , i know you see flashes
of the daria that you remember ,
the strong woman , the woman who escaped ,
and the woman who wants to get better ,
but your sister is permanently damaged
because of what he did to her .
this is where she needs to be .
i am truly sorry .
she just wanted to say good @-@ bye .
it &apos;s time for therapy now .
so , that &apos;s it ?
was i helpful ?
yes , you were .
i have everything that i need .
you take care , daria .
hey . do you think you &apos;ll ever catch joe &apos;s partner ?
i &apos;m not sure .
but we &apos;re still looking .
well , good luck .
good @-@ bye , daria .
&quot; there are times when the mind is dealt such a blow ,
it hides itself in insanity .
there are times when reality is nothing but pain .
and to escape that pain , the mind must leave reality behind . &quot;
