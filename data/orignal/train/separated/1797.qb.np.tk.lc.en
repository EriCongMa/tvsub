i &apos;ve had this thing for my roommate since day one ,
and i can &apos;t tell her .
wouldn &apos;t it be easier to just ask her out ?
are really as shallow and callous as you seem ?
oh , you want to go out for a drink later and
hear about my secret pain ?
i can &apos;t . i &apos;m seeing someone .
save yourself the misery , man .
she &apos;s off the market .
what ? but she &apos;s not . i mean , if she was ...
i live with her-- i would know it .
and the longer this little fling goes on ,
the more favors you get over the others--
who are fighting tooth and nail just to make it through this program--
when those people start finding out what &apos;s going on ...
what is this that we &apos;re doing here ?
you need a definition ?
the next time i see you favoring meredith grey in any way ,
i &apos;ll make sure she doesn &apos;t see the inside of an o.r. for a month .
okay , anyone who says you can sleep when you die ,
tell them to come talk to me after a few months as an intern .
of course , it &apos;s not just the job that keeps us up all night .
you have to get up now .
what ?
oh , my god , what time is it ?
it &apos;s 5 : 20,
and i have prerounds .
and you have to leave before they see you .
oh , come on , now .
why don &apos;t you just let them see ?
no !
please !
no . no .
you get any sleep ?
oh , she could oil the bedsprings as a courtesy
or at least buy a padded headboard .
so , who &apos;s the guy ?
you think it was just one guy doing all that work ?
do you mind if i don &apos;t think about that ?
oh , jealous ?
i &apos;m not jealous .
i am .
but at least i know she &apos;ll be having a long day at work .
well , at least we know brain surgery
isn &apos;t his only skill .
they can &apos;t be-- he &apos;s her boss .
we &apos;re late .
he &apos;s all of our boss .
she has been scrubbing in a lot lately on his surgeries .
no , meredith wouldn &apos;t sleep with him just to-- no .
if she &apos;s not ashamed of it , why is she keeping it a secret ?
maybe she didn &apos;t .
maybe it just happened--
you know , spontaneously , last night .
hi . good morning .
morning .
it sounded like you were having pretty radical sex last night ,
all night long .
who was the guy ?
no one you know .
we &apos;re late . let &apos;s go .
i mean , if life &apos;s so hard already ,
why do we bring more trouble down on ourselves ?
what &apos;s up with the need to hit the self @-@ destruct button ?
yikes , wouldn &apos;t want to meet you in a dark alley .
right back at you .
a run ? you run ?
every day , babe , every day .
not suffering enough ?
what doesn &apos;t kill you , makes you stronger .
don &apos;t go acting all indefatigable .
you &apos;re dragging like the rest of us .
oh , what is that-- professional weakness , dr. yang ?
it &apos;s called the flu .
yeah .
i need a major rush to make it through this day .
i need a kick @-@ ass surgery .
ooh , you a bad boy last night , george ?
that would be meredith .
you a bad boy , meredith ?
do tell .
nothing to tell .
that says it all , huh ?
sorry , i have a sex life .
don &apos;t apologize .
embrace it .
share it .
count me in .
yeah . next time , just let me know
if i need to go to a hotel so i can get some sleep .
am i missing something ?
you were just a little loud .
do they know it &apos;s mcdreamy keeping them up all night ?
i hope not .
i already have bailey riding me .
i don &apos;t need my roommates thinking i &apos;m getting special treatment .
o &apos;malley , yang , karev-- go on to clinic .
o &apos;malley , patients are waiting .
you two come with me .
izzie , you &apos;re hanging with me today .
good morning , dr. shepherd .
dr. bailey .
late night , grey ?
no , caffeine just hasn &apos;t kicked in yet .
if you were at all religious ,
you would want to start praying it kicks in soon .
there &apos;s a consult in the pit .
girl with a fever and abdominal pain .
after that ,
nicholas in 3311 needs his meds .
mr. moeller &apos;s i.v. fell out ,
and he &apos;s a hard stick .
post @-@ ops in 1337 , 3342,
3363 , and 2381 .
381 .
3342 , 3363,
and 23 ...
why are you still standing in front of me ?
you look more like me than you right now . what &apos;s the matter ?
nothing .
help ! i need immediate help .
what &apos;s the problem ?
my damn boyfriend swallowed my keys .
i didn &apos;t want her to leave .
locate the lady &apos;s keys .
i think she got some bug
on her trip to mexico with her friends .
i told her not to go to a third world country ,
but does she ever listen ?
she &apos;s been weak ever since , and she &apos;s lost weight .
apparently .
and this morning , she passed out in the shower .
when was the trip ?
a couple weeks ago .
i &apos;m really fine . i just have a fever .
okay , well , will you lie back for an exam for me ?
no , please , i don &apos;t need an exam .
just give me some antibiotics , send me home .
well , maybe it is just a fever ,
but they called down for a surgeon ,
so i have to give the okay to let you go .
so just let me do the exam .
do the exam .
no .
this is crazy . i &apos;m fine .
for god &apos;s sake , claire ,
i don &apos;t want to spend my entire day here .
you know , actually , mrs. rice ,
this might be easier if we had some privacy ,
so would you two mind leaving the room ?
that &apos;s fine .
digby .
digby owens . i have an appointment .
excuse me , sir-- uh , you &apos;re bleeding .
you mind if i--
sure , sure . have a look .
that &apos;s a gunshot .
yeah .
we got a gunshot wound . we got to get him down to the pit .
sit . mr. , uh -
digby . all right ,
but it isn &apos;t an emergency . i scheduled it .
what , the gunshot ?
yeah . my buddy shot me .
buddy ?
yeah , just as a favor .
on purpose ?
hell , yeah .
he wasn &apos;t trying to hurt me or nothing , but you know ...
but why ?
i like the scars .
look , everyone in town has tats ,
but my art is about commitment .
so , this your art , huh ?
damn straight .
damn stupid . the bullet went all the way through .
bounced off my ribs .
i have another one still in my shoulder .
nice , huh ?
you could hang it in the louvre .
i have an ethos .
why do anything
unless you &apos;re willing to go one step further than anybody else ?
what doesn &apos;t kill you , makes you stronger .
exactly .
and pain is the great divide .
my coach used to say ,
it &apos;s all about how we process pain .
football ?
wrestling , iowa state .
iowa ? 141 .
157 .
you got to be more than 180 now .
i &apos;d like to see you get back under 145 .
excuse me , but thinking of you men in tights makes me want to ...
puke .
there &apos;s a flu going around the hospital .
somewhat ironic .
don &apos;t push so hard .
can you lift your shirt ? so i can examine your stomach ?
where did you get these ?
claire ... you &apos;ve had surgery recently .
these scars are still pink .
don &apos;t tell my parents .
you did this in mexico so your parents wouldn &apos;t know ?
what did you have done ?
and you noticed her foot twitching ?
come on , jamie .
my foot .
oh , yeah .
about three months ago ?
just a little .
we took her to county hospital , and she got the c.t. scan ,
which showed her--
brain abnormality . here , you can put it .
and the twitching has gotten worse ?
a lot worse . they don &apos;t have the proper equipment back home
to figure out what &apos;s wrong .
you did a-- you did a good thing .
yes , your mommy .
show mommy and daddy .
okay . you did a good thing by coming all this way ,
mr. and mrs. hayes .
you sit tight , jamie , okay ?
i &apos;m going to bring in dr. shepherd to see you .
okay ? dr. shepherd .
he &apos;s the brain specialist .
my mommy and daddy .
doctor ? is he good , this dr. shepherd ?
at just about everything .
i assume the lady needs her keys
to leave this guy &apos;s sorry ass behind .
yeah .
well , help her out .
he needs a bronchoscopy .
see one , do one , teach one .
you &apos;ve seen one . it &apos;s time to do one .
alone ?
seriously ?
thanks . i mean ,
the vote of confidence in my skills and all--
i didn &apos;t think anyone was noticing how hard--
izzie ? go .
yeah .
you paged ?
where are we ?
i did the consult , did the i.v. , the meds ,
the post @-@ ops , everything .
how &apos;s your pit patient ?
she &apos;s febrile and has peritoneal signs .
you all right , dr. yang ?
fine .
on my way back to clinic .
i think she had some sort of illegal surgery done in mexico .
botched abortion ?
no , she has four laparoscopic scars on her abdomen
and won &apos;t say what they &apos;re from . the parents are clueless .
oh , she &apos;s a minor .
17 . freshman in college .
you order up for a c.t. ?
yes .
so , while she &apos;s there ,
the nurses couldn &apos;t get a foley on mr. gry .
he may need a coude cath if you can &apos;t get a normal one in there .
write up post @-@ op notes on all surgical @-@ floor patients
that had surgery within the last 24 hours .
be sure to document their ekgs and x @-@ rays .
hunt them down if you can &apos;t find them .
right away .
got the flu ?
yeah , and thanks for it .
it &apos;s making my life so much easier .
i didn &apos;t give it to you . it &apos;s all over the hospital .
you should be in bed .
disease , diagnosis , and prescription from one man .
seriously , i &apos;ll give you a ride home .
this is not gonna make me go home .
you go home .
but i feel fine .
hey , hey , hey-- have you seen shepherd ?
not as up close as meredith has .
what ? are you trying to get her in trouble ?
she &apos;s our friend .
george , this program will make or break our careers , okay ?
some of us will make it through , and some of us won &apos;t .
and that decision depends entirely
on recommendations from doctors like shepherd .
there is a reason we don &apos;t sleep with the attendings .
it &apos;s not her fault , it &apos;s shepherd &apos;s .
he &apos;s the attending . he should know better .
he &apos;s taking advantage of her .
it didn &apos;t exactly sound like
anything was happening against her will last night .
okay , we &apos;re in good shape here .
i think so , dr. shepherd .
looks good .
here you go , doc .
the kid &apos;s c.t.s just arrived from kennedy .
thanks .
excuse me .
sorry , dr. taylor .
that would be bourbon .
what ?
i smelled it , too .
and he &apos;s the best anesthesiologist on the staff .
i &apos;ll worry when he &apos;s too juiced to do
his crossword puzzle .
will you close up for me ?
thank you , everyone .
dr. shepherd ...
i got to get some coffee .
jamie hayes has been admitted .
the little girl with the brain abnormality .
how &apos;s she presenting ?
she has what looks like continuous seizure activity in her left foot .
her balance is off .
her parents have come a long way to try to find out what &apos;s wrong .
how old are these ?
three months old .
i need new ones .
her brain could look dramatically different today .
okay , i &apos;ll order them ...
thank you .
doc .
and that-- that &apos;s a bullet from a previous gunshot .
previous gunshot ? okay .
no reason to take it out .
no , the guy likes pain .
it &apos;s his ethos .
pain as an ethos ?
wait , i think i know this guy .
you remember this guy ?
hey , the tattooed masochist .
had himself shot again .
glad to see he &apos;s still stupid .
it &apos;s his ethos .
let &apos;s go tell him what he gets to do today .
dr. bailey ?
claire rice &apos;s abdominal c.t.s.
is this girl fat ?
not at all . she &apos;s a normal college kid .
so what do you see ?
her stomach &apos;s stapled .
she &apos;s had a gastric bypass .
and a bad one , at that .
gastric bypass is a procedure normally done on obese patients
to help them lose weight .
claire ?
she doesn &apos;t need to lose weight .
are you kidding ?
this means the world to her .
but it is so typical of this girl to take the easy way out .
she &apos;s done it with everything since she was a little kid .
mrs. rice , nothing about this is gonna be easy .
she &apos;s gonna face a lifelong struggle with malnutrition
unless she has surgery to reverse the procedure .
do the surgery .
i told her to watch the freshman 15 &lt; / i &gt; --
don &apos;t eat junk , exercise .
but when she came home christmas ,
who had to take her out and buy her a brand @-@ new pair of size @-@ 6 jeans
because she couldn &apos;t get in the ones i got her last summer ?
tina , you know , she tries so hard .
she does . she gets good grades . she gets &quot; a &quot; s .
she has illegal surgery in mexico .
unfortunately , there were complications with the bypass .
what do you mean ?
she has what looks like an abscess under her diaphragm
an edema , which is a swelling of the bowel wall .
i can &apos;t say for certain she &apos;ll recover completely .
just ... do whatever you have to do to make her well , okay ?
you look like a princess .
do you know you &apos;re a princess ?
it &apos;s not lipstick .
it &apos;s not lipstick ? no , it &apos;s not lipstick .
want to do my shoulder ?
oh , good . thank you .
and nose ?
now , we &apos;re gonna find out what &apos;s causing these seizures .
does mri know we &apos;re coming down ?
you said c.t.
now i &apos;m saying mri .
it &apos;s available .
good .
doctor , is she gonna need surgery ?
i don &apos;t know yet .
well , it &apos;s just that my wife and i , we both work .
and i don &apos;t know if our insurance--
we know it can be very expensive .
i don &apos;t want you to worry about that .
it &apos;s a focal , left @-@ size seizure .
let &apos;s get that diazepam running right now , please .
a tourniquet , please .
tourniquet .
hey , jamie , here &apos;s what we &apos;re gonna do .
we &apos;re gonna put this on your arm , okay ?
isn &apos;t that fun ?
here , we &apos;re gonna put that onto you , like that .
and this is gonna feel cold .
this is a butterfly .
butterfly lands right there .
mmm , there we go . blanket for the butterfly . good . nicely done .
it &apos;s amazing stuff , isn &apos;t it ?
hey , you like spaceships ?
yeah .
you do ? okay , should we take captain o &apos;malley ,
my first lieutenant , to the spaceship mri ?
let &apos;s go .
it &apos;ll be safer to wait until your lunch digests
before we do the procedure .
perfect-- this is just perfect .
i was hoping to be in portland right now .
you &apos;re gonna be under conscious sedation ,
which means you &apos;ll be awake , but groggy .
wait , wait . is this gonna hurt ?
though you &apos;ll have some discomfort , we &apos;ll give you something for pain .
do you know how stupid you make me look ?
i thought you would think this is funny .
funny ?
romantic ?
like the therapist thing was funny and romantic ?
that was funny .
no , that was sad .
he called my therapist , pretending to be his therapist ,
to find out what i &apos;d said about him .
a little passive @-@ aggressive , isn &apos;t it , j.p. ?
a little ? he is the king of passive @-@ aggressive .
and he &apos;s manipulative ...
and needy .
well , that &apos;s the trifecta .
what do i win ?
what ?
doc !
i prefer we stop meeting like this , mr. owens .
digby .
so , how &apos;s the trumpet playing ?
very safe , compared to your hobby .
getting shot is a little more risky .
that &apos;s kind of the point .
he &apos;s running a fever .
due to the extra stress on his body from the gunshot .
digby ...
the impact of the bullet on your chest
fractured a rib and caused a hemopneumothorax .
that sucks , i guess .
there &apos;s blood in your collapsed lung .
the price of body art went up since your last gunshot .
ah , no pain , no gain , right ?
that &apos;s one way to look at it .
we have that in common , you docs and me .
do we ?
yeah , the way you guys push , push , push .
when i was wrestling ,
if you wanted to pin me , you was gonna have to kill me .
iowa style .
iowa state style .
back home , we were sworn enemies .
but in seattle , man , we &apos;re brothers .
so , what are we gonna do about this , um ... hemopneumo @-@ durasis ?
we &apos;re gonna insert a chest tube to drain the blood ,
then reinflate your lung .
oh , please ...
tell me i get to watch .
oh , man , iowa style .
before you guys start , i know you &apos;re mad .
disbelief , claire-- just ... disbelief .
i &apos;m just concerned .
where did you get the idea to do this ?
the internet .
honey , there is a healthy way to lose weight .
yeah , i tried that , but ...
it doesn &apos;t work for me like it does for you .
hey , you don &apos;t need to lose weight .
what are you eating ?
and how much have you been working out ?
most of the time , when people hit their target weight ,
they have to work to stay there .
everyone gains weight in college , mom .
it &apos;s ... stressful .
there &apos;s-- there &apos;s not enough time for exercise .
i just thought if i wasn &apos;t worried about my diet , then ...
i could focus more on my studies .
so you took yet another shortcut ?
life doesn &apos;t work that way , claire .
tina !
what ? you want to argue this ?
she has so much potential . if she would just apply herself ...
okay , i think we should focus on taking care of your daughter .
and , claire , your parents agree--
the best thing to do is to reverse the bypass .
no !
no , it &apos;s my body .
i do not want surgery again . please ?
there are serious complications .
and this is about your health .
but i &apos;d rather be thin .
well , i &apos;m afraid the choice isn &apos;t up to you .
it &apos;s called rasmussen &apos;s encephalitis .
what it amounts to is that this side of her brain--
this part &apos;s all healthy , it &apos;s working perfectly .
this black part of the brain , this-- all of that is dead , or dying .
the condition has gotten radically worse
since her c.t. scans three months ago .
left untreated , the disease is gonna kill her .
how soon ?
too soon .
so , is there a cure ?
the treatment requires the diseased portion
of her brain be removed and sealed off .
see , eventually , the spinal fluid will fill the cavity .
remove ? but , i mean , that &apos;s--
half her brain , yes .
half her brain-- that ... seems impossible .
her age makes it possible .
her brain &apos;s not fully developed ,
so the remaining neurons will compensate for the loss .
but will she be normal ?
there are risks to any surgery ,
and this is , you know , a major one .
but if , you know , we &apos;re successful ,
jamie could walk out of this hospital in a couple weeks ,
go on to live a relatively normal life .
look , i know this is a lot to digest .
the important thing to remember is that we can save her life .
thank you .
dr. o &apos;malley ?
yes ? what ?
i &apos;m sorry to bother you .
but if the parents consent ,
i thought you &apos;d like to scrub in on the hemispherectomy .
are you in , or not ?
uh , in .
good .
yang .
i &apos;m scrubbing in on a hemispherectomy with shepherd .
get out ! i would kill for that .
we &apos;re gonna cut out half a girl &apos;s brain
and it &apos;s going to work .
it &apos;s outrageous .
almost makes it hard to hate him .
why do you hate him ?
oh , no reason .
you know about him and meredith ?
you know ?
when are you gonna figure out that i know everything ?
she knows .
what , about doctor @-@ cest ?
it &apos;s been going on for , like , ever .
and you didn &apos;t tell us ?
ooh , you &apos;re a gossip , huh ?
i am not !
i am .
he &apos;s about to go into major brain surgery on no sleep ?
not very responsible .
jealous much ?
sex all night isn &apos;t about being responsible .
no , it &apos;s about sex all night .
i can &apos;t believe you &apos;re not more pissed off about this .
you of all people .
well , she works hard all day . she &apos;s good at her job .
why should you care how she unwinds ?
i mean , you like to bake all night . some people like to drink .
others like an occasional screaming orgasm .
yeah , we do .
forget i said that .
pretend like i &apos;m not here .
continue .
you look like you need to be spoon @-@ fed .
you look like alex .
yeah , about drinking--
dr. taylor , the anesthesiologist--
do you think he drinks ?
whatever gets you through the day .
i mean here , at work . earlier , i thought i smelled--
do you think-- i mean , his patients trust that--
so i should say something , right ?
it &apos;s a can of worms , george .
weren &apos;t we talking about sex , anyway ?
doofus .
this is gonna leave a pretty sexy scar , huh ?
don &apos;t get any more crazy ideas .
you really think my ideas are crazy ?
i &apos;m leaning that way .
we wrestle , he plays trumpet .
hey , i feel pretty dizzy .
you &apos;ve lost some blood .
this too shall pass .
how come i don &apos;t see you down at the mat in belltown ?
oh , man , no time .
bro , make time .
i &apos;ll be expecting you .
i &apos;m there .
handle with care .
this thing &apos;s full of gunk .
i know .
we need to free the bowel from the adhesions caused from the abscess .
this poor girl ...
what was she thinking ?
she wants her mother &apos;s approval .
she wanted to please her .
and this damage is the result ?
here , resect that .
needle @-@ tip bovie , please .
when you &apos;re done here , you have post @-@ ops waiting .
i know , dr. bailey .
cristina &apos;s got the flu , so you need to pick up the slack in the clinic .
look , i &apos;ll mop the floors , okay ?
sorry , that was inappropriate .
it &apos;s not the only thing that &apos;s inappropriate .
now we are on the subject .
you care to tell me what you think you &apos;re doing ?
look , i &apos;ll jump through hoops if you want me to .
but what i do when i leave this hospital is my business .
half this hospital knows your business .
flu isn &apos;t the only virus spreading around here .
i made a choice , and i know you don &apos;t respect me for that choice .
but i &apos;ll live with the consequences .
then i &apos;ll have lots of hoops for you to jump through .
i &apos;ve done everything you &apos;ve asked me to do .
i may not do it your way , but it gets done .
so whatever else you got , bring it on .
okay , dr. grey , now that you &apos;ve drained the organ ,
we can attempt to repair it .
now my day is perfect .
i appreciate this .
the chance to scrub in on this kind of procedure is , well--
yeah , i appreciate it .
here you go . triple espresso , not too hot .
oh , i love you , seriously .
ah , coffee-- where would medicine be without it , huh ?
i hope you have a new crossword , taylor .
we &apos;re gonna be here a while .
never go without .
big day for you , kid , congrats .
thanks .
hey , princess .
you ready to take a nap ?
hey , look what i got . blow bubbles
that &apos;s it .
you just breathe in .
oh , that &apos;s it .
what ?
do you smell ...
smell what ?
i have a mask .
i &apos;m sorry , dr. taylor , but did you just ...
have you been drinking ?
i beg your pardon ?
what ?
do you smell-- i @-@ i smell alcohol .
where the hell do you get off accusing me of something like that ?
george , you &apos;re out of line .
there are rules .
you know , there are rules for a reason . you ju-
there is a 2 @-@ year @-@ old girl on this table .
you shouldn &apos;t take advantage of someone else &apos;s vulnerability .
i don &apos;t need some punk intern telling me what &apos;s at stake here .
get him out of here , shep .
shep ?
you &apos;re out , george .
you damned well better be ready , taylor .
i wouldn &apos;t be here if i wasn &apos;t .
do you really , seriously want to know why i &apos;m leaving ? ! seriously ?
how about when you started insisting that i quit my job ,
right when i started to make more money than you ?
that should have been the last straw .
no , the last straw should have been when i found out
that those mysterious phone calls
that you &apos;ve been getting that you kept denying were from other women--
were really coming from your mother !
this isn &apos;t healthy .
just hold still , please .
don &apos;t you dare try to patch this up !
okay , could the both of you just please stop ?
you don &apos;t love me , j.p.
you love to smother me .
and if i could get you to just admit that ,
then i could leave you with an ounce of respect .
athena , i let you stay in here to keep him calm .
so if you &apos;re just gonna keep arguing--
check that !
i can &apos;t respect a man desperate enough
to swallow my exit strategy .
that is the last straw !
michelle , can you get her out of here ?
ma &apos;am ?
fine !
come on .
what ?
what &apos;s happening ?
the keys moved farther down .
oh , my god , what does that mean ?
what did you do ? don &apos;t you dare die , j.p. !
please ! please , just shut up !
breathe , j.p. just breathe .
got it .
very impressive , j.p.
is he okay ? is he gonna be okay ? you okay ?
yeah , he &apos;ll be fine .
you lit-- you did that on purpose , didn &apos;t you ?
can i offer you some advice ?
get in your car and go ,
for all of our sakes .
you &apos;ll never know where i parked it .
i need a shower .
i need a shower .
you need to go tell that girl &apos;s parents
what kind of kid they &apos;re getting back .
you &apos;re not gonna let me shower first ?
that would be a hoop , would it not ?
it would qualify .
shower first , then .
ew , what smells ?
that would be me--
or more specifically , my patient &apos;s insides all over me .
that makes me strangely happy .
oh , god . oh , meredith , you smell like ...
karma .
what ?
nothing .
something vile &apos;s stuck in your hair .
you know , just go stand over there , please .
ugh , how much do i love being a surgeon right now ?
karma .
what does karma have to do with anything ?
i &apos;m just saying , you &apos;ve been given all the best surgeries .
and now you smell like putrid goo
and you &apos;re giving off a stench .
karma &apos;s a bitch .
dr. shepherd needs an intern in surgery .
which one of you is clear to go ?
okay , dr. bailey , where do you want me ?
you need to lie down somewhere .
i &apos;m fine . i &apos;m completely healthy .
grey ?
of course .
what is your problem ?
um , you !
&apos;cause apparently , you can help dr. mcdreamy
in ways the rest of us can &apos;t .
you did not just s-
yes , i did !
hemispherectomy in o.r. one
with dr. shepherd . go .
apparently ...
i &apos;m not the only one with hoops .
doctor ...
digby &apos;s post @-@ op cbc shows
a severe spike in the white blood cell count .
what is it ?
it &apos;s 27 , with 16 % bands .
something else is wrong .
that &apos;s a little high for simple stress .
check for any other possible sources of infection or recent illness .
we &apos;re gonna start the procedure with the left temporal lobectomy .
thanks for joining us , dr. yang .
after the temporal , we &apos;ll do the frontal ,
and then the occipital .
we were able to reverse the gastric bypass ,
but we did lose a significant portion of her bowel .
and because of the short gut syndrome ,
claire will never eat normally again .
okay , wait , do-- how do we help her here ?
well , getting proper nutrition will be a lifelong problem for claire .
great .
as if we already don &apos;t have our hands full with her .
she gets good grades .
she stays out of trouble .
she &apos;s smart .
i just think she feels like
nothing she does is good enough for you .
if you somehow think that i &apos;m responsible for this--
i think claire is killing herself ...
to please you .
please .
you have no idea what &apos;s going on in that girl &apos;s mind .
you &apos;re her mother .
she worships the ground you walk on .
she didn &apos;t do this for herself .
i think that this situation is completely ridiculous .
tina ... shut up .
what is it ?
i &apos;m freezing , doc . i @-@ i @-@ i can &apos;t stop shaking .
his temp &apos;s way up and b.p. &apos; s dropping , doctor .
all right , digby , have you had any recent illnesses ,
new piercings , tattoos , wounds ?
new tat on my calf .
oh , my god .
it was nowhere near that nasty this morning .
but it was infected ?
why didn &apos;t you say anything ?
ah , it was nothing .
i &apos;m not here to complain about a little pain .
well , the infection &apos;s been exacerbated
by the stress on your body from the gunshot .
get him to icu .
we &apos;ll get you started on some antibiotics .
from the frontal lobectomy , i &apos;m going to encounter a , uh ...
we &apos;ll encounter the anterior cerebral artery .
yes , so we &apos;re gonna need to , uh ...
the branches of the artery need to be coagulated and divided .
you know , taylor , her anesthesia &apos;s awful light .
come on , taylor , she &apos;s waking up .
dr. taylor ?
uh , he &apos;s asleep !
taylor !
dr. taylor !
oh , god , sorry . sorry , i &apos;m on it .
my bad , shep .
he was right , wasn &apos;t he ?
aw , i nodded off . come on .
whatever you got to do to get through the day , right ?
steph , get me some coffee .
yes , doctor .
i &apos;ll be fine . it won &apos;t happen again .
yeah , not in here , it won &apos;t .
uh , steph , call dr. pennington .
hopkins , take over until she gets here .
get out of here and get it together .
what happened ?
he went into multisymptom organ failure ,
secondary to overwhelming sepsis .
now he &apos;s all ...
i &apos;ll fix his b.p. ,
that should help his mental status .
he &apos;s maxxed down pressures .
we got v @-@ tach .
he &apos;s looking bad .
put the defib pads on him and give him 150 ...
i lost his pulse .
defib ! get the pads ! get the pads !
this packing , we hope , will , uh ... prevent hemorrhaging .
dr. yang , do you want to add something to that ?
it will allow the cerebral spinal fluid to eventually fill the cavity .
very nice .
e.t. , you want to close up ?
yes , doctor .
i &apos;m gonna go to bed .
that was ... unreal .
i mean , that &apos;s-- that &apos;s all there is .
i was feeling sick until i came here .
i was tired .
now i &apos;m tired again .
it &apos;s back to reality .
let me explain .
it &apos;s fine .
no , there is a code among doctors .
we &apos;re not supposed to ask each other questions ,
not within the walls of this hospital .
okay , i was out of line .
no , you weren &apos;t . i was .
i was out of line .
somebody should have taken responsibility ,
and it should have been the guy doing the cutting .
it should have been me .
you didn &apos;t deserve what happened to you today .
you did the right thing , code or no code .
you saw me leave the house this morning , didn &apos;t you ?
oh , was that you ?
i &apos;m not using her .
and i don &apos;t favor her .
she &apos;s pretty great , you know .
so , come on let &apos;s go tell jamie &apos;s parents
she &apos;s gonna be fine , barring any complications .
did you fix me ?
no , not completely .
so ... i won &apos;t get fat ?
no .
oh ... that &apos;s awesome .
claire , i &apos;ve asked social services to contact your parents .
why ?
they can help you .
with what ?
you don &apos;t know this yet ,
but life isn &apos;t supposed to be like this .
it &apos;s not supposed to be this hard .
time of death , 20 : 49 .
the first guy i ever met out here from back home .
i thought you &apos;d be asleep by now .
yeah , well ... i &apos;m not .
if you wait a few minutes , you can have a piece of cake .
baked it chock @-@ full of love ...
actually , chock @-@ full of unrelenting ,
all @-@ consuming rage and hostility , but it &apos;s still tasty .
so , you know ?
i know .
well , do you want the long , sordid version ,
or the short version ,
where i started sleeping with a guy
who turned out to be my boss ?
neither .
izzie , cut me some slack here .
no .
you went to dartmouth .
your mother is ellis grey .
you grew up-- look at this house !
you know , you walk into the o.r. ,
and there isn &apos;t anyone who doubts that you should be there .
i grew up in a trailer park . i went to state school .
i put myself through med school by posing in my underwear .
you know , i walk into the o.r. ,
and everyone hopes i &apos;m the nurse .
you have their respect without even trying ,
and you &apos;re throwing it away for ...
what , a few good surgeries ?
no .
it &apos;s not about the surgeries .
it &apos;s not about getting ahead .
then what ?
a little hot sex ?
you &apos;re willing to ruin your credibility over that ?
i mean , meredith , what the hell are you doing ?
oh , my god ...
you &apos;re falling for him .
i am not .
oh , you so are .
no , i &apos;m not .
you so are .
damn it , you poor girl .
you know , it &apos;s just that he &apos;s just so ...
and i &apos;m just-- i &apos;m having a hard time .
wow , you &apos;re all , uh , mushy and ...
warm and ...
full of secret feelings .
i hate you !
and your cake .
my cake is good .
so , um , how hot is the sex ?
izzie ...
what ? come on , i &apos;m not getting any .
help a girl out with a few details .
maybe we like the pain .
how &apos;s she doing ?
good .
good .
maybe we &apos;re wired that way ...
christina ?
... because without it ,
i don &apos;t know ...
... maybe we just wouldn &apos;t feel real .
you know , we could just ...
sleep ?
we could , yeah , if you want to .
yeah ?
what &apos;s that saying ?
&quot; why do i keep hitting myself with a hammer ? &quot;
oh , thank god .
