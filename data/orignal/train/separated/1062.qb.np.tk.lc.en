there is no security on this earth , only opportunity .
that is not what i want to hear
from the man i &apos;m asking to consult on my security .
well , you got to love irony .
what &apos;s the event ?
it &apos;s tomorrow &apos;s launch party
for parfum bijoux &apos;s new fragrance line ,
inspired by the blend wore by marie antoinette .
where else would the new line be @-@ headed ?
well , at least you didn &apos;t ask if it smells like cake .
eh , that &apos;s too obvious .
they &apos;re displaying the original formula
in its original atomizer on loan from the marquise de tourzel ,
and fully insured by sterling bosch .
you have a date to this little soiree ?
would it matter if i did ?
not at all .
we agreed to keep this casual .
yeah ...
we did .
amis @-@ amants .
amis @-@ amants -- &quot; friends who have fun . &quot;
the french have a word for everything .
i might stop by afterwards .
i might make you a late dinner .
yeah ?
yeah .
that &apos;s how this whole thing got started .
i wanted to thank you for helping with the delancy case .
see , i thought the thank @-@ you was what came after dinner .
then you &apos;ll have to thank me for helping with the security .
i better not mess this up .
don &apos;t .
okay , should i be thinking
five @-@ star restaurant or cape cod clambake ?
yes .
honey , come on ! one hint !
hon , the whole point of a surprise getaway --
it &apos;s a surprise , i know , but do you really want to be
lugging around my entire wardrobe for two days ?
well , luckily for you ,
i have the upper @-@ body strength of a norse god .
oh , and you don &apos;t mind
if we go by the parfum bijoux event , right ?
just for two minutes .
two minutes ? no . two hours ? yes .
oh , honey , it &apos;s really important to sara .
yes , and she &apos;s a big girl ,
and it &apos;s not nearly as important as you and i
finally getting some time away with no distractions .
i know . you &apos;re right .
we promised each other no work talk .
who &apos;s that ?
oh , that &apos;s jones .
he &apos;s here to ...
not talk about work ?
i &apos;ll make it quick .
and don &apos;t bother looking in my bag .
i pack to deceive .
what do you have ?
ellen &apos;s tax returns .
keep the bureau out of it ?
yeah .
diana &apos;s contact at the irs came through .
good .
well , what do you think ?
did she hide the evidence box in the empire state building ?
her first job after witsec that moved her to new york .
has this employer i.d. number here -- griffin @-@ moore .
private security firm .
perfect way to satisfy her inner cop .
and one of their clients
was a tech startup in the empire state building .
that &apos;s got to be it .
well , the question is , how do we search it ?
we don &apos;t . we keep our distance and let neal search on his own .
does he know where to look ?
he will .
all right , i need you and diana to keep an eye on neal .
neal while you &apos;re gone .
we always do .
between the car accident and everything else ,
el and i really need to get away .
no , i understand .
thanks .
honey ? your phone just buzzed .
might be the hotel . do you remember the area code ?
my phone &apos;s on me , hon .
but nice try .
she still hasn &apos;t figured out where you guys are going , huh ?
no , she hasn &apos;t ,
but she &apos;s conducting a very thorough investigation .
i &apos;m sure she is .
and then this is it .
wow . look at that .
i can see why you wanted my help .
do you love it ?
i do .
you two ready to kick off your romantic weekend ?
yes .
she doesn &apos;t know where we &apos;re going , so nobody say anything .
okay . is it safe to mention the earrings ?
are those emeralds ? they &apos;re beautiful .
well , thank you . they were my grandmother &apos;s .
oh , speaking of beautiful ...
oh , my gosh .
from marie antoinette &apos;s bedroom in versailles .
does it smell like cake ?
cake . what ?
oh , nothing .
i &apos;m gonna check in on the staff .
i &apos;ll take you back .
great .
so ... you and sara ?
deduce that all by yourself ?
i did .
shouldn &apos;t you be leaving for your bed @-@ and @-@ breakfast soon ?
enough . remember , i &apos;m only to be disturbed --
if someone dies . i know the drill .
oh , the rusty egret .
yeah .
must be checking in for our confirmation .
hello ?
well , everything &apos;s under control .
good .
now you two can relax this weekend .
i hope you can , too .
me ?
don &apos;t play innocent .
i know you &apos;ve been dealing with a lot ,
and me asking you to lie to peter only added to it .
i understand why you want to keep him out of this .
i just want him safe .
no argument here . keep him far away .
well , our check @-@ in is confirmed ,
but our dog @-@ sitter just canceled .
oh . let &apos;s call the bermans .
busy .
i &apos;ll watch satchmo .
what ? no .
what ? you don &apos;t trust me with your dog ?
i don &apos;t trust you with my house .
all right , i can bring satchmo over to my place .
perfect . a vacation for satchmo .
all right . here .
oh , no need .
i &apos;ll use the one in the fake rock in your flower bed .
instructions are on the table .
our valuables are inventoried , and the second we &apos;re back ,
we &apos;re changing the locks and resetting the alarm codes .
i would expect nothing less .
and maybe sara could drop by
and check in on satchmo , as well ?
hmm , what ?
sure .
yeah , sure . why not ?
yes , of course .
go .
go , have a great weekend . come on .
satchmo &apos;s in good hands . he &apos;s covered .
they know .
yeah , they know .
hey , listen , can we go by that new coffee shop ?
i want to get an iced latte .
unless we &apos;re going someplace cold .
get the ice .
i &apos;ll get the hot chocolate .
so , this is the security setup .
it &apos;s fairly simple , but it should do the trick .
nice field of vision .
decent lux parameter .
i only see one problem .
you &apos;re being robbed .
what ?
look .
everybody , be cool !
this is a robbery .
do as we say , and no one will get hurt .
you , get over here . get down .
hey , you , big boy ,
hand your piece over to the lady nice and easy .
all right , everybody , eyes to the floor .
no heroes today , folks .
babe , i can &apos;t get it .
oh , god .
yeah , you got it babe . you got it . just hit it .
she &apos;s gonna be upset if she doesn &apos;t get that perfume .
not as upset as her boyfriend .
everybody stay down or you &apos;re gonna eat a bullet !
he &apos;s gonna kill somebody .
sara , wait !
i leave for two minutes , and it &apos;s a costume party ?
shut your mouth and get on the floor .
down !
sara , do what he says .
what does she think she &apos;s gonna do with that ?
get out .
attitude like that will get you
some serious time in the cottage , honey .
oh , my god .
let &apos;s go .
thank you , everybody .
we &apos;re blocked in .
you &apos;re such a gentleman .
for you , my dear , anything .
damn van .
this way .
give us the keys .
my wife is in the car .
i don &apos;t care .
you &apos;re making a very big mistake right now .
it &apos;s huge .
one more word and somebody gets hurt .
come on .
that &apos;s right .
get in .
baby , we don &apos;t need them .
they saw our faces . drive . get in .
was this a part of the surprise ?
what is this ? some kind of substation ?
abandoned by the city . it &apos;s ours now . move !
i &apos;m only gonna say this one more time .
my wife , elizabeth , and i
were leaving town for a getaway weekend .
that &apos;s all -- - shut up !
empty your pockets .
do it !
peter and elizabeth burke , warren street , cobble hill ,
just like they said .
oz , we are not kidnappers .
listen to her .
you let us go now , you &apos;re looking at armed robbery .
but if you keep us here ,
you &apos;re playing in a whole new ballpark .
you watch too much &quot; law &amp; order . &quot;
we let them go , and they go straight to the cops .
just let us walk .
we -- we promise -- we &apos;re not gonna --
you &apos;ll what ? dummy up ?
we look like amateurs to you ? !
s @-@ s @-@ stop !
okay , we just need a second to figure this out .
baby , you need to relax , okay ?
yeah . yeah . all right , all right .
we &apos;ll just make sure our fish don &apos;t swim .
thought they were bonnie and clyde .
they came in with these masks --
we officially have ourselves a new case .
nate &quot; oz &quot; --
oh , you go ahead .
oh , no , ladies first .
why not guys first ?
okay .
nate &quot; oz &quot; -- - nate &quot; oz &quot; osbourne was serving a 15 @-@ year sentence
for assaulting a police officer
when he escaped hudson correctional last week .
we cross @-@ referenced caffrey &apos;s physical description --
thank you , caffrey --
against former hudson inmates , and we got our guy .
osbourne and his lady friend
abandoned their getaway car at the scene .
nypd cordoned the area ,
but so far , no trace .
the perfume wasn &apos;t their first target , either .
their m.o. matches a theft from weatherby &apos;s two days ago --
the wedding ring joe dimaggio gave marilyn monroe .
it made its way on to the finger of osbourne &apos;s better half .
well , nothing says commitment like a stolen wedding ring .
any information on the girl ?
not much .
we got her prints off the guard &apos;s gun ,
but no criminal record .
they left the guard &apos;s gun behind ?
she dropped it in a champagne bucket .
could i see the ballistics report from the shot oz fired ?
kid &apos;s barely old enough to vote ,
and he thinks he can threaten you ?
the second i get you out of here ...
he &apos;s in over his head .
way over .
i don &apos;t think they want to hurt us .
maybe not her , but him ?
&quot; dummy up &quot; and &quot; fish &quot; are prison slang .
he &apos;s done time .
or watched a lot of tv .
shut up down there !
she &apos;s a calming influence .
maybe if i talk to her ,
appeal to her on a personal level .
i don &apos;t know .
i have done this before .
that makes two of us .
well , at least this time , we get to be tied up together .
good news .
with a slight adjustment ,
our third act is back on track .
so penny here is gonna babysit while i take care of business .
be safe .
always .
if you &apos;re ditching our car , we have bags in the trunk .
what makes you think i &apos;m ditching your car ?
all that &quot; law &amp; order &quot; i watch .
if we &apos;re gonna be here for a while ,
it &apos;d be nice to change our clothes .
&quot; change our clothes . &quot;
cobble hill .
how long have you two been married ?
we have a love for the ages .
i mean , why do we need some stupid contract
to tell us what we already know ?
for starters , health insurance ,
homeownership , shared cellphone plans .
uh , what oz and i have is much bigger than all of that .
he &apos;s a really good guy with a really , really big heart .
you &apos;ll understand if we don &apos;t see him that way .
well , you don &apos;t know him , so ...
right .
he is good .
and , sure , his cousin talked him into stealing car parts ,
but that doesn &apos;t make him a bad person .
you don &apos;t serve hard time for stealing rims .
what happened ?
it was his first time .
the police showed up .
when they told him to raise his hands ,
he accidentally dropped a battery that he was holding
on the cop &apos;s foot .
accidentally ?
what else was he supposed to do other than drop it ?
i mean , the guy had a gun in his face .
the officer didn &apos;t see it that way ?
no .
the cop lied to the d.a.
they charged him with assault on a police officer .
you can get 15 years for that .
that &apos;s exactly what the judge gave him .
i mean , he didn &apos;t deserve that .
so he was released early on good behavior .
no .
he escaped , and you helped him .
the cop lied . the judge wouldn &apos;t listen .
what else were we supposed to do ?
i mean , the system failed him .
all we have is each other .
i mean , i &apos;m sure there are a ton of people out there
who are worried about the two of you right now .
you have no idea .
uh , this is esther from the rusty egret .
i thought we were confirmed you &apos;d be here by noon ,
and it &apos;s almost 3 : 00 .
i &apos;ll try your cell again .
wait . the suit actually gave you access to his house ?
yes , moz .
unwise . we should teach him a lesson .
i &apos;m thinking micro cam in a lampshade .
he &apos;ll find it , of course , but that &apos;s the point .
we &apos;re picking up satchmo and we &apos;re leaving , all right ?
fine .
i don &apos;t see why you &apos;d want to pass up
a prime opportunity such as this , but whatever .
whoa ! seriously ? boxed wine ?
we got to get out of here .
you mind picking up satchmo &apos;s water bowl ?
it &apos;s over by the desk .
and no snooping . uh @-@ huh .
whoa , the suit left ellen &apos;s irs forms
out here for anyone to see .
hey . no . i said no .
they &apos;re from when witsec moved her to new york .
well , any insight into her life from that time
could help us isolate where she hid the evidence .
it &apos;s a long shot .
so is blindly searching a 2 @-@ million @-@ square @-@ foot building .
excellent point . here . allow me .
okay .
you know , it &apos;s not too late to hide that micro cam --
not gonna happen .
okay .
next .
next .
jesus , baby , what took you so long ?
well , i acquired us a new vehicle
and i finished up recon for our third act .
and you went to gristedes ?
yeah . well , we got a big day tomorrow .
can &apos;t do it on an empty stomach .
you are too good , baby .
you have to admit -- they are kind of sweet together .
i hope that &apos;s the stockholm syndrome talking .
burkes of cobble hill , keep up the good behavior ,
there might be some of my famous
chow @-@ hall casserole in it for you .
you sure they didn &apos;t give you trouble ?
sure .
hey , hon .
i see it .
the second they realize they &apos;ve kidnapped a federal agent ,
all bets are off .
you packed your gun .
do you think you can get to it ?
not without help .
we &apos;re gonna have to do this together .
there is still a chance that we can get the atomizer back
before the event tomorrow , right ?
yeah , we &apos;re on it .
okay .
you okay ?
ballistics is still on scene ,
but we got a hit on osbourne &apos;s sidekick .
i had hudson correctional
pull his correspondence and visitor logs .
so we &apos;ve got a name .
yeah , penny chase .
clean record .
she works as a copy editor for a book publisher
specializing in paperback romance novels .
what is her connection to osbourne ?
prison pen pals turned soul mates .
copies of the prison letters right here .
they met while he was in prison ?
and it wasn &apos;t by chance .
penny was a longtime subscriber to mugshot monthly .
apparently , she liked osbourne &apos;s mug and wrote him .
their relationship took off from there .
this is not a real magazine .
oh , yeah . women who fall for inmates -- it &apos;s a thing .
they &apos;re called prison bunnies .
oh , god . the weird gets weirder .
says the only woman in the room who &apos;s actually dated an inmate .
hey . it is not the same . neal .
wait . are you familiar with this phenomenon ?
during my prison stay , i may have had a few admirers .
more like a few hundred .
but didn &apos;t you respond with a form letter ?
only after the carpal tunnel .
i let them down easy .
right . let &apos;s get back to the case , huh ?
i skimmed a few of their letters .
you know , it &apos;s like they think they &apos;re characters
in some great love story or something .
take a look at this .
osbourne promises to make her an honest woman
after his release .
i mean , it &apos;s possible he lured her into this .
well , he made her an honest woman by getting her a ring .
he kept his promise .
if he made her any other promises ,
it might lead us to their next target .
are these all the letters ?
there &apos;s about 700 .
let &apos;s get started .
oh , no , no .
d @-@ don &apos;t add the onions raw like that .
you should saute them . they &apos;re much sweeter that way .
fine .
what do i do ?
well , y @-@ you get a saut pan , and you heat up some butter .
the silver one .
oh , that &apos;s ... way too much butter .
you want to come in here and do this ?
well , i do sort of run a catering company .
may i do that ?
i don &apos;t think so .
you do have a gun .
it &apos;s the proper knife .
damn , lizzy burke , you got some skills .
you know , harriet van horne said it best .
cooking is like love .
you either approach it with abandon or not at all .
love and abandon .
kind of dig that .
i thought you might .
the first time i made this for penny ,
she said i cooked better than her own mother .
she was lying through her teeth .
but it was really cute .
so , where were you gonna take her ?
to a bed @-@ and @-@ breakfast in the green mountains .
nothing but nature , my beautiful wife ,
and a couple of good crime novels .
would have been amazing .
no , seriously , like ...
where were you gonna take her ?
you &apos;ve kidnapped me .
you don &apos;t get to judge me .
come on , don &apos;t you think that sounds boring as hell ?
no , i think it sounds relaxing as hell .
different strokes , i guess .
i mean , the part about the book sounds okay .
i like romance novels .
but true crime is good , too .
most of them don &apos;t have happy endings .
no , but the romance books do .
that &apos;s why i like reading them .
so , that &apos;s how i got the idea to start the ... ooh .
you okay ?
yeah , i think i just got some garlic powder in my eye .
you want to wash it out or something ?
um ... actually , uh , i think i have some eye drops in my bag .
hey , pen , you help lizzy out with her bag ?
yeah .
thanks .
should be right on top in the toiletry bag .
perfect .
oh , this is beautiful !
it &apos;s a classic von furstenberg .
you should try it on .
really ?
there &apos;s some shoes in there , too .
oh . i wasn &apos;t sure how to pack .
peter , hey , uh , three things --
nobody &apos;s dead , satchmo &apos;s fine ,
and i changed your alarm code ,
which i &apos;ll gladly give back to you
in exchange for some maple syrup .
tell elizabeth i say hi .
how are the burkes ?
maintaining radio silence , as promised .
i &apos;m just calling to let them know
it &apos;s all quiet on the satchmo front .
you find something ?
yeah , too bad peter &apos;s not here .
he &apos;d love this .
last august , oz promised penny to treat her like a queen .
the marie antoinette perfume bottle .
we were right . he &apos;s stealing to fulfill a promise .
right , and i might think it was adorable
if they didn &apos;t snatch my perfume .
bastards .
okay ...
what are you not telling me ?
it &apos;s me .
i &apos;m up for a new job , neal .
running the london branch of sterling bosch .
wow . that &apos;s ...
my chances were excellent .
but if -- if you lose the perfume bottle ...
i lose all of it .
i probably should have said something sooner .
i -- no , no .
i mean , why -- why would you ? we &apos;re just , you know --
amis @-@ amants .
right .
well , it &apos;s not like i &apos;m running away to an island or something .
well , technically , britain is an island .
you think oz will like it ?
i do .
it &apos;s just , you know ,
with everything that he &apos;s been through ,
i @-@ i just want to make him happy .
you really believe the system failed him .
i know it did .
after oz told me his story , i looked into it .
turns out it &apos;s not the first time this cop lied .
he has a history of dishing out trumped @-@ up charges .
did you show this to the d.a. ?
yeah , his public defender wouldn &apos;t listen .
i mean , he said we didn &apos;t stand a chance .
really ? this looks damning to me .
i told you .
he got a bum rap .
soup &apos;s on , baby !
coming !
hope you &apos;re hungry .
if you don &apos;t eat , i &apos;ll be offended .
so , what do you think ?
what ?
i was just wondering how i got so lucky .
we should probably untie his hands .
hands only . and just for dinner .
all right ?
thank you .
is that a jayer echezeaux ?
is that how you say it ?
all i know is -- a case costs 12 grand .
don &apos;t worry . we didn &apos;t pay for it .
now , i &apos;ll go out on a limb and say
penny &apos;s ring wasn &apos;t a hand @-@ me @-@ down from grandma ?
it was marilyn monroe &apos;s .
i love marilyn .
you know , it &apos;s funny .
i spent two years behind bars
just pissed off that life screwed me over .
and then i met penny ,
and she made me realize that you only get one life .
and you better live it .
and this crime spree is what you call living ?
three years of my life has to be worth something .
the world owes us that .
what happens when the world catches up to you ?
we won &apos;t let it .
so , peter , uh ,
elizabeth tells me that you are a professor at columbia .
what do you teach ?
journalism .
now , i &apos;m guessing , by the age difference ,
that , uh , lizzy here was your student .
a little &quot; hot for teacher &quot; action , huh , liz ?
am i right ?
guilty as charged .
still nothing on the ellen front ?
well , apparently , the irs codes its forms differently
for people in witsec .
that or ellen spent three years
as a ribbon dancer in circus vargas .
i think i &apos;d go with the first one .
availing yourself of federal resources
could speed along the process .
yeah , i can &apos;t .
i promised elizabeth i wouldn &apos;t involve peter .
and once you find the box ?
i want my father to come back and live a normal life .
ellen &apos;s evidence can give him that .
and while we &apos;re on the topic of items just out of reach ...
ah , the perfume search .
if we find it ,
there &apos;s a good chance sara &apos;s moving to london .
and you &apos;re ambivalent about what that means to the two of you .
yeah . don &apos;t give me that look .
i know i said we wouldn &apos;t get serious again , but --
looming expiration date is forcing you to wonder if you should .
neal , it &apos;s just a fantasy .
for guys like us , the only regret is permanence .
that &apos;s just how it is .
diana , what &apos;s up ?
you said penny chase was wearing hoop earrings , right ?
yeah , why ?
e.r.t. found an emerald earring up the street from the boutique ,
but what &apos;s strange is the backing was attached .
elizabeth was wearing emerald earrings when they left .
so she took it off on purpose .
if she and peter were delayed for a few minutes ...
you heard from him ?
i tried him an hour ago . it went to his voicemail .
i &apos;m sure they &apos;re fine .
yeah .
look , all i &apos;m saying is that compared to you ,
peter here seems a little boring .
please . i wish he were boring .
i hate this conversation .
wait . so , you &apos;re telling us that he &apos;s not ?
you know , some of the stories he &apos;s covered
have been incredibly dangerous .
some nights , i lie awake and i can &apos;t sleep , worrying .
the point is -- i like boring ,
and there &apos;s no one i &apos;d rather be boring with than this man .
so , two nights in an old house in vermont
is your idea of a party ?
the rusty egret .
surprise .
i guess it is . you &apos;re a wild man , petey .
drop your dish .
oh , i &apos;m gonna clean up .
i &apos;m sorry .
no , i &apos;ll get a broom .
no , no , it &apos;s -- i &apos;ll help .
oh . i &apos;ll get it , i &apos;ll get it .
do we have a bag ?
hey , honey , can you please get me a --
what the hell do you think you &apos;re doing ?
special agent peter burke ?
everyone listen up .
our bolo turned up agent burke &apos;s car
at an impound in flatbush .
we found peter and elizabeth &apos;s cellphones
in a dumpster two blocks from the boutique .
we &apos;re ordering the j.o.c. stood up until further notice .
we have to assume they &apos;ve been taken .
simpson , i want your team to stay on the letters .
foster , pull the traffic @-@ cam footage
in the area where the car was recovered .
and flag any missing @-@ vehicle reports .
chase and osbourne are gonna need a new getaway car .
let &apos;s go . peter &apos;s countingn us .
neal , how could this happen ?
wrong place , wrong time .
but there &apos;s a bright side .
a bright side to kidnapping ?
yeah . ballistics came in .
oz is shooting blanks . why would he do that ?
they don &apos;t want to hurt anyone .
but it doesn &apos;t mean they won &apos;t .
no , it doesn &apos;t .
what can i do ?
help us comb through these letters .
if we beat them to their next target ,
we find peter and elizabeth .
but oz buries his promises in romantic symbolism ,
and he is open to interpretation .
then let &apos;s get to interpreting .
where do you want to set up ?
my place has a hungry dog
and a wine @-@ drinking speed @-@ reader .
your bring the photo copies . i &apos;ll bring the coffee .
oz , this doesn &apos;t have to change anything .
we just kidnapped an fbi agent .
yeah , but we didn &apos;t mean to .
you think they care about that ?
penny &apos;s right . this is a mistake .
oh , we are through talking to you .
oz , listen to me .
this has gone far enough .
your best option -- your only option --
is to let us go and turn yourselves in .
that &apos;s your advice ?
yes .
i just got out , and you want me to walk back in ?
we &apos;re never gonna be together .
no . no .
we &apos;re gonna work this out , okay ?
it &apos;s gonna be fine .
do you still want to go for the third act ?
yeah .
yeah , we get it .
we skip town , just like we planned .
okay , what about them ?
we can &apos;t let them go now .
maybe they could be of some use to us .
yeah .
i &apos;ve been through this entire pile twice now .
it still reads like a bad romance novel ,
with more misspellings and redactions .
they don &apos;t have spell @-@ check in prison .
what they lack in technique they make up for with heart .
do they have to write every day ?
&quot; i love you . i adore you . i worship you . &quot;
how many ways can they say the exact same thing ?
this many ways .
moz , will you , uh -- - yeah , i &apos;ll get him .
fresh air -- the antidote to sentimental drivel .
come on , satchmo .
so , london . hell of a city .
it is .
i spent the summer there when i was younger --
with my sister .
my parents warned us to stay away from islington ,
&apos;cause that &apos;s where the bad kids hang out .
so , of course , we were there every night .
of course .
smoking cigarettes with the street artists
and flirting with the bad boys .
well , i don &apos;t smoke , but i do flirt .
yeah ?
yeah .
you &apos;re also a very bad boy .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
i hope you get the job .
not because i want you to leave --
because i want you to be happy .
i have to admit -- it has been a lot of fun
spending time with you up in the clouds .
but the ground beckons .
&quot; there is no security on this earth , only opportunity . &quot;
send me a postcard ?
yeah . more than one . less than 700 .
does that mean i get a poem ?
will you use spell @-@ check ?
stop it .
&quot; in the clouds . &quot;
what ?
neal , oz says multiple times
that his favorite childhood memory
is when his father took him to the kennedy space center .
yeah , something about wish he could fly through the clouds
and off to the moon .
right .
and then two days before he gets out , he writes this .
&quot; give me your love , and i &apos;ll give you the moon . &quot;
so what if he &apos;s going to give her the moon ?
i mean , not the whole thing , but --
maybe a piece of it .
okay , neal , there &apos;s only one moon rock in town --
from apollo 17 .
yeah , we see it .
it &apos;s on display at the new york hall of science in queens .
you really think he &apos;s gonna steal her a rock ?
yeah , oz &apos;s final promise to penny was to give her the moon .
we got a hit on peter and elizabeth .
10 minutes ago , a stolen car
used its e @-@ zpass at the midtown tunnel .
we got a shot of it on the security camera .
it &apos;s them . they &apos;re hitting the museum .
i &apos;ll mobilize swat . let &apos;s go !
all right , we &apos;re on our way .
get museum security on the phone .
let them know what &apos;s coming .
fbi ! please open the door .
good morning , agent --
don &apos;t move . i mean it .
special agent peter burke .
do as he says and you won &apos;t get hurt .
get in .
hey , baby , we &apos;re inside .
open your coat . come on .
take his gun .
yeah , get the gun .
in the chair . come on .
what &apos;s the code for internal security ?
37294 .
i told you -- you don &apos;t need elizabeth .
keep me as your hostage . i won &apos;t cause any trouble .
yeah , you won &apos;t cause us any trouble
because we got your wife .
hon , i &apos;ll be okay .
yes , she will ,
as long as you do exactly what we say .
they &apos;re already inside .
we &apos;re being robbed .
call the police !
we got to find another way in .
neal , we need to wait for the fbi .
look , it &apos;s peter and elizabeth .
i &apos;m not waiting .
neal !
hands .
you are only making this worse for yourself , oz .
quiet .
have a seat , both of you .
that moon rock &apos;s the most valuable thing in this place .
neal , at least tell me you have a plan .
look , if they &apos;ve got peter and elizabeth
and the fbi shows up , this turns into a hostage situation ,
unless ...
unless what ?
you have a bargaining chip ?
yeah .
i &apos;m gonna steal the moon .
not alone , you &apos;re not .
it &apos;s peter and elizabeth .
all right .
that &apos;s it ?
that is it .
well , as far as priceless objects go , i &apos;m not impressed .
it &apos;s 4.1 / 2 billion years old , 200,000 miles from home ,
and worth 100 times its weight in gold .
37294 . that did it !
good job , pen .
hey , oz , isn &apos;t that --
yeah , from the perfume shop .
they &apos;re stealing the moon rock .
what the hell is going on ?
hey , you -- you &apos;re coming with me .
i &apos;m not leaving my wife .
i beg to differ .
all right , if anything goes wrong ,
just meet me in the lobby .
pen , look at me .
this is what we wanted , remember ?
all right .
now , burke .
come on .
you don &apos;t have to go through with this . you know that .
i kinda do .
i &apos;ve never actually seen you steal anything before .
well , that is one of the perks of being my plus @-@ one .
let &apos;s go .
hey , sinatra , you want to tell me why
you and baton girl are stealing my rock ?
oh , your rock ?
that &apos;s funny , because according to
article vi of the 1967 u.n. outer space treaty ,
it &apos;s not yours .
neal .
i got this , peter .
oh , you two know each other . that &apos;s cute .
now give me the damn rock .
i don &apos;t think so .
ballistics confirm you were shooting blanks .
neal .
what ?
he has my gun .
okay .
so , what &apos;s it gonna be ?
sara , your baton .
i &apos;m warning you .
and i &apos;m educating you .
the moon has no atmosphere ,
no free oxygen , and no surface moisture .
that &apos;s why this rock is vacuum @-@ sealed in nitrogen .
once it &apos;s exposed to our atmosphere ,
it crumbles to dust in a matter of seconds .
sara .
i do like to smash things .
yeah , and i &apos;ll shoot both of you .
not before one of us smashes your rock .
let peter go and it &apos;s yours .
everybody wins .
have it your way . sara .
wait !
enjoy .
matter of seconds , huh ?
i may have exaggerated a little bit .
it would have turned to dust in another billion years .
he &apos;s not making it out of here .
you and sara exit the same way you came in .
let the fbi know that penny and oz are both armed .
peter , where are you going ?
to get my wife back .
you &apos;ve been a criminal less than a week , penny .
i don &apos;t think you &apos;re cut out for this .
it &apos;s better to burn bright than slowly fade away , like you --
like what ? peter and me ?
we are not boring .
hell , this is not even my first kidnapping .
seriously ?
yeah .
every morning my husband walks out the door ,
a part of me worries if he ever walks back in .
do you have any idea what that feels like ?
yeah . i do .
then stop him before he gets hurt .
you didn &apos;t stop peter .
i tried .
but whether i like it or not ,
people like you happen to people like us .
that &apos;s life .
elizabeth --
you know , i &apos;m supposed to be on a romantic weekend
with my husband right now , and instead ,
i &apos;m stuck here with you , living your moment .
which , by the way , just caught up with you .
what ?
no !
penny , it &apos;s over .
oz is going back to prison .
no , he is not going anywhere .
we promised each other that we would not get caught .
if it is over for him , then it is over for me , too .
i was never gonna shoot you ,
just like you &apos;re never gonna shoot me .
i guess neither of us are cut out for this , huh ?
i never wanted to be good at this .
penny .
caffrey ! where the hell did you come from ?
inside . i &apos;ll explain later .
peter and elizabeth are in there .
so are penny and oz , and they &apos;re armed .
with peter &apos;s gun .
okay , you guys hang back .
let &apos;s move in !
let &apos;s go !
el .
penny and oz just went out front .
it &apos;s okay . building &apos;s surrounded .
that &apos;s just it --
i think they &apos;re planning on going out there like bonnie and clyde .
honey , what are you doing ?
what ? they need our help . come on .
no , they &apos;re not . damn it .
come out peacefully with your hands in the air .
oh , my god .
it &apos;s the most beautiful thing i &apos;ve ever seen .
i got you the moon .
come out quietly . raise your hands .
you ready ?
we don &apos;t want to hurt you .
just stay close , all right ? maybe we can --
penny , oz , come on .
stay back , liz .
you can &apos;t go out there .
you know what &apos;s gonna happen . just tell him .
penny , don &apos;t listen to her , okay ?
we have a love for the ages .
oz , listen to me .
there &apos;s a swat team out there
with automatic weapons and body armor .
you try to shoot your way out of there ,
and they will kill both of you .
yeah , not if i kill them first .
don &apos;t be a fool , oz .
this isn &apos;t you .
i know you served three years
for something that should have been a misdemeanor .
you got a bum rap , and i &apos;m sorry .
you were using blanks so no one got hurt ,
but that &apos;s exactly what &apos;s about to happen out there
for both of you .
you love her ?
yeah .
do you really love her , oz ?
yes !
real love ... is fighting like hell
to hold on to every moment you have with her .
it &apos;s making a life together
and making it work no matter what happens .
you want a love for the ages ?
i think that &apos;s great .
prove it .
make it last .
listen , they &apos;re just gonna take me away from her .
no .
they can take away a lot of things ,
but they &apos;ll never take away what you two have together .
you go out there , and it ends .
give me the gun , oz .
it could have gotten pretty ugly back there .
you understand why i --
i do .
i &apos;m just glad you &apos;re okay .
take him away .
so , what &apos;s gonna happen ?
she &apos;ll get probation ,
and this time , he &apos;ll get a fair trial .
write me ?
every day .
come on , sir .
we still have to give our statements ,
but it &apos;s not too late to try and get away .
maybe not the rusty egret , but --
i just want to go home .
yeah .
first ...
they found it .
thanks , hon .
nice .
great .
okay .
i just gave sterling bosch the good news .
well , here &apos;s some more .
isn &apos;t this evidence ?
nobody &apos;s gonna miss it ,
as long as it &apos;s back tomorrow morning .
how would you feel about being my plus @-@ one tonight ,
no strings attached ?
you know i like a good party .
thank you .
yeah .
you asked neal to lie to me .
you have every right to be upset ,
but you understand why i did it .
to protect me . i get that .
i knew you wouldn &apos;t let it go ,
even after the car accident .
but , hon , the one thing that truly scares me is losing you .
i had to do something .
neal and i will always have secrets ,
but you and i -- we don &apos;t .
no more secrets .
starting now .
there was a file that indicated
where ellen might have hidden the evidence box .
i checked it for prints .
it was here in the house .
neal found it , like i hoped he would .
you wanted him to dog @-@ sit satchmo .
i &apos;m helping his search
without putting myself in harm &apos;s way .
and you didn &apos;t want me to know --
because i didn &apos;t want you to worry .
no more secrets .
so now that we &apos;re on the same page ,
what about you and neal ?
he took the bait . now what ?
you cracked it ?
it &apos;s a government code . of course i djd .
it turns out that employer i.d. number
is for a security company named griffin @-@ moore ,
which is linked to the 50th floor
of the empire state building .
let &apos;s get that box and bring my father home .
