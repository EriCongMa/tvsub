Cort, this is... this is Callie, my... my sister.
She's the girl you loved
and couldn't be with for some reason.
Do you ever think that maybe the only reason why we got together
was because we were the only two gay boys in our grade?
We were friends first.
You don't feel like my friend anymore.
Why don't you date Ana?
You guys would be so cute together.
Wait, you're bleeding. Let me see.
If I let them take me out of this home,
they're just gonna put me in another one.
If you're ever not feeling this,
then just be honest with me.
I finally believed you guys were desperately in love.
Well, guys, we made it.
Opening night.
Mat and I couldn't have done it without you.
Well, that's true.
And now we get to, uh, just coast for the rest of the year
'cause our senior project is done.
Screw you. I still got a dumb-ass paper to write.
Although, I... I guess it only, uh, matters
if you go to anchor beach.
You know, I wish I would have thought of this when I was a senior.
All right, well, thank you all for being here
and making this possible.
Yeah, you owe me big time.
Uh, yeah he does!
So, just remember to, uh,
talk loud, tell the truth,
and "unbreakable" on three.
Let's go. One, two, three.
Unbreakable!
All right, guys. I'll see you out there.
Hey, Mariana!
Flowers for my, uh, beautiful flower.
Aww! Thanks.
Anytime. Come here.
Give me that.
We should open them at the same time.
Okay.
Hey. I... I didn't think you were gonna come.
I wasn't gonna miss your show, Brandon.
Uh, here.
Animal crackers.
It's dumb, I know.
I bought them before...
you know.
Hey, um, I'm gonna open the house if that's...
Okay. Yeah. Sure.
你在哪儿 就要开始了
Neighbors reporting what sounded like domestic violence.
Sorry, you're gonna miss the show.
Yeah, me too.
Hey, Foster.
Hi.
I know this place.
I've been here before. My kids...
this is their last foster home.
?Two households, both alike in dignity?
?In fair Verona, where we lay our scene?
?From ancient grudge break to new mutiny?
?Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean?
It's kind of ironic that I'm playing the nurse
when I'm really Mat's Juliet
and you're more like his Rosaline.
?From forth the fatal loins of these two foes?
?A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life?
?Whose misadventured piteous overthrows?
?Do with their death?
?Bury their parents' strife?
?The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love?
?And the continuance of their parents' rage?
?Which, but their children's end?
?Nought could remove?
?Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage?
?The which if you?
?With patient ears attend?
?What here shall miss?
?Our toil shall strive to mend?
If I'm being honest, this play is kind of dumb.
What do you mean?
If Romero and Juliet just told somebody
they were in love and already got married,
maybe they could have worked it out
and it wouldn't be so tragic.
I mean, sure, it would have been
hard on the families and everyone,
but they would have had to figure it out, right?
Secrets are, like, the worst.
They didn't have to die.
?Along this road of shadows?
?You got to bend a few rules?
?To put down the overthrows?
?If you want to keep control?
?that's just the way it goes?
?You got to keep your eyes wide open?
?If you want to make it out on top?
?Like you're hoping?
?They can try to hold the line?
?It's a just a waste of time?
?Nothing you could do?
?Could ever stop us?
?We're unstoppable, unstoppable?
?Nothing you could say could ever break us?
?We're unbreakable, unbreakable?
?Oh, we're unbreakable?
?If you want to keep control?
?That's just the way it goes?
?Nothing you could do could ever stop us?
?We're unstoppable, unstoppable?
?Nothing you could say could ever break us?
?We're unbreakable, unbreakable?
?We're unbreakable?
I'm sorry about Connor.
Never been in love before...
um, but, uh...
I... I know what it's like to feel alone.
Sorry they shut your group home down.
But you know it wasn't safe.
I know.
But they're gonna find you a good home.
And until then...
I'm happy you're here.
Me too.
Thanks.
Good night.
?What's an island without an ocean?
?What's a star without a sky?
?There's a picture of us in my memory?
?But we're fading to the back of my mind?
?All I really know is?
?I need you back here?
Tell me in sadness, who is that you love.
Out of love.
"Out of love"?
Out of her favor, where I am in love.
Be ruled by me.
Forget to think of her.
O, teach me how I should forget to think!
By giving liberty unto thine eyes.
Examine other beauties.
I dreamed a dream last night.
I'm a mom, Brandon.
I'm sorry, but that's the way it is
and if you can't handle that, then...
I... I never said I couldn't handle it.
Well, you might as well have the way you...
responded to that woman on the beach yesterday.
"I'm not his father." You just... you blurted it out
like she was...
accusing you of something!
Okay. I'm sorry.
This is... kind of new to me.
Brandon, all I'm asking is
that you be honest about what you can handle.
You gotta decide if you're ready for this,
and not just because of Mason.
You gotta decide if you're really ready to get over Callie.
Here's the thing.
If you're not done with Callie,
like, really, truly done...
then I have to be done with this.
They are Capulet.
So they are.
But they're my mother's sworn enemy.
Shall we?
Go.
Please.
Come on.
Happily met, my lady and my wife.
That may be, sir, when I may be a wife.
That "may be" must be, love, on thursday next.
What must be, shall be.
What lady's that?
I know not, my friend.
Go to her!
?Love, we were made for love?
?Living while we're young?
?Nothing's gonna stop us?
?Nothing's gonna stop us?
?Something about you?
?I got to figure out?
?'Cause I'm believing dreams can come true?
?Turning everything upside down?
?Nothing's gonna stop us?
?Nothing's gonna stop us?
?Nothing's gonna stop us?
?Nothing's gonna stop us?
A Montague?!
Now, by the stock and honor of my kin,
to strike him dead I hold it not a sin!
So we think the wife's still inside,
but we haven't heard anything from her yet
and he won't let us in without a warrant.
Based on what dispatch said, we have cause for entry.
No. Listen, I know this guy, okay?
I arrested him last year and he had a gun.
So we wait for the negotiator.
Do you really want to do that? What if the wife is hurt?
If I remember correctly,
there's a clear view through the back door.
Okay. All right. Take your team around back.
See what you can find.
But soft! What light through yonder window breaks?
Romeo. O, Romeo! Wherefore art thou Romeo?
Deny thy father and refuse thy name.
Or, if thou wilt not...
be but sworn my love,
and I will no longer be a Capulet.
?You speak near and true?
?Though not a word I hear from you?
?For your eyes say it all?
?And I admit I'm about to fall?
?Because what we have?
?There is no controlling this?
?This love could be great?
?But they say it would be wrong?
?I don't care?
?I'd be lost without you?
What are you doing up so late?
Uh, just...
trying to get this song right.
Sounds pretty good to me.
Eh, I don't know.
I don't know if the harmonies are...
right, but... do you actually...
do you think you could wake up Mariana?
Maybe get her to sing with me?
Wait, you really want me to unleash the beast?
And you know what she's like when you try to wake her up.
Be afraid. Be very, very afraid.
Well, do you... do you think you could maybe sing with me?
Uh, no. I'm... I'm...
Come on.
Please?
Okay. Uh, Juliet's part goes like...
No, I know it. I've heard Mariana sing it, like, a billion times.
Okay.
?This love could be great?
?But they say it would be wrong?
?I don't care?
?I'd be lost without you?
?We live because we love?
?We love 'cause we belong?
?Yes, I swear?
?Oh, you heal the scars?
?That never felt a wound?
?And we'll never need their rules?
?To guide the way?
?Love will light the day?
?What's in a name?
?I'm ready to risk the blame?
?Call me your own?
?No matter where we've got to go?
?'Cause what we have?
?There is no controlling this?
?This love could be great?
?But they say it would be wrong?
?I don't care?
?'Cause I'd be lost without you?
?We live because we love?
?We love 'cause we belong?
?Yes, I swear?
?Oh, you heal the scars?
?That never felt a wound?
?And we'll never need their rules?
?To guide the way?
?Love will light the day?
?Love will light the day?
?Love will light the day?
?Love will light the day?
Okay.
It's funny. Um...
I was talking to Mariana earlier
and she was saying how...
if Romeo and Juliet...
had just told their parents...
then maybe their ending wouldn't have been so tragic.
Do you ever think what...
might have happened if we just told?
Juliet!
Honey nurse!
My love is an honest gentleman.
Come with us.
Where?
To Friar Laurence's cell.
I, a husband to make your young maiden, mine wife.
A husband?
Romeo?
Midnight angel, can you love the gentleman?
Aye.
Juliet!
His name is Romeo.
And a Montague.
The only son of your great enemy.
God's lady dear!
Is this the poultice for my aching bones?
Honey nurse, I beg of thee.
?Happily ever after?
?No, it doesn't exist?
?It's just a lie to?
?Get you to take the risk?
?Gotta guard your heart?
?Oh, I know you feel he's a perfect fit?
?But nothing about this makes sense?
That's it! Come on!
Just let it go! Just to hell with Connor!
Now let's scream!
No, no! Like...
Like, scream! Like...
?Even if this is love?
?It's never gonna do?
Let's away.
?When I look in your eyes?
?I see the one that I want for all time?
?Just place your hand in mine?
?Together I know we can conquer the darkest night?
?I will be yours?
?Forever, forever?
?I will be yours?
?Forever?
?Every song I sing, it's you?
?Every laugh I laugh, it's you?
?When I look in your eyes?
?I see the one that I want for all time?
?When I look in your eyes?
?I see the one that I want for all time?
?Just place your hand in mine?
?Together I know we can conquer the darkest night?
?I will be yours?
?Forever, forever?
?I will be yours?
?Forever?
?Every song I sing, it's you?
?Every laugh I laugh, it's you?
?Every hope I have is you?
?I will be yours?
?Forever, forever?
?I will be yours?
?Forever, forever?
?I will be yours?
?I will be yours?
?forever, forever?
?I will be yours?
?I'll be yours?
?Forever?
?Just say, "I do"?
?I do?
Hey, you... you okay?
Hey, what's wrong?
Y... you're doing great out there.
Yeah, I... I know. It's just...
This is really hard.
Why?
I know I shouldn't say this, but...
because I still love you.
Then why didn't you answer my letter?
What... what letter?
Vogue, well...
It's perfect.
I wrote you a letter and I put it in your bag.
Well, I... I never got it.
What did it say?
That I still love you too.
Baby, baby! You are killin' it!
Come here, come here.
Eyes on suspect.
He is armed, looks to be a .45,
And no sign of the wife.
Copy. She's not there.
How do you you that?
She just pulled up out front.
She hasn't been there all day.
Well, then who's inside?
Gentlemen, good e'en.
A word with one of you.
And but one word with one of us?
Couple it with something.
Make it a word and a blow.
Romeo.
The love I bear thee can afford, no better term than this:
Thou art a villain.
It's going great, right?
You know, maybe we should just rewrite the show.
What if Juliet just chooses Paris instead?
Yeah, I don't... I don't think
Brandon would like that very much...
Or Shakespeare.
Well, I guess it's good they died then.
I mean, Romeo and Juliet were never gonna make it as a couple.
I don't even think they ever consummated their relationship.
Everybody knows sex is where the real bonding happens.
Like with me and Mat.
When we had sex, it really took things to the next level
and it really brought us so much closer.
You know, and I knew that I could trust him.
He's just not the kind of guy who would just
have sex with a girl and then dump her.
Anyway, see you out there.
?Along this road of shadows?
?You got to bend a few rules?
?To put down the overthrows?
Wait, don't!
?if you want to keep control?
?That's just the way it goes?
?Nothing you could do could ever stop us?
?We're unstoppable, unstoppable?
?Nothing you could say could ever break us?
?We're unbreakable, unbreakable?
?Oh, we're unbreakable?
Can you ID any children inside?
Drop the gun!
?You got to keep your eyes wide open?
?If you want to make it out on top like you're hoping?
No! Stop!
?They can try to hold the line?
?It's just a waste of time?
?Nothing you could do could ever stop us?
?We're unstoppable, unstoppable?
?Nothing you could say could ever break us?
?We're unbreakable, unbreakable?
?oh, we're unbreakable?
Mercutio, stop!
No!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
Okay. Hold you fire!
Suspect is down! Suspect is down!
Requesting medical stat!
Tybalt!
Mercutio's soul is but a little way above our heads.
Either thou or I or both of us go with him!
Thou, wretched boy, shall with him hence!
Romeo, away!
Be gone from Verona!
Paris will doom thee to death.
Nay!
Be gone! Away!
Uh, I... I think, uh...
I think I did something stupid.
What?
I kissed Jude.
Well, why is that stupid?
I mean, do you like him?
Y... yeah, I... I do,
but as a friend.
I... I... I'm not gay.
So why did you kiss him?
He was just so... so upset about Connor,
and I... I wanted to make him feel better.
Well, then you have to tell him the truth.
Tybalt is gone
and Romeo banished.
Romeo that killed him, he is banished.
Paris shall not make me a joyful bride.
Hold then.
Go home, be merry,
consent to marry Paris.
Take thou this vial, being then in bed,
and this distilling liquor drink thou off.
When presently through all thy veins shall run no pulse
the roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade
and in this borrowed likeness of shrunk death,
thou shall continue two and forty hours,
and then awake as from pleasant sleep.
In the meantime, against thou shalt awake,
shall Romeo by my letters know our drift
and hither shall he come to save you.
Love, give me strength...
and strength shall help afford.
Farewell, dear Friar.
Me thought we had more time?
The time has arrive'd.
?I know it was just a moment ago?
?When we stepped out on this road?
?But now I can't imagine love?
?Without you here?
?So hold my heart though you're far away?
?It's not the end but one more day?
?Until we make it through?
?Know that I love you?
?I will be brave?
?I will be strong?
?Nothing can tear us apart?
?Just one more step?
?Just one more breath?
?For you, I will?
?I will be brave?
I... guess that's everything.
Hey, everything's... everything is gonna be okay.
Maybe this will, you know, be your last foster home.
Maybe this will be your forever home.
So listen, um...
I shouldn't have kissed you.
No, I... I'm glad you did.
I'm not...
really over Connor, but...
I realized I... I can get over him.
And, you know, maybe there's someone else out there.
Oh, you forgot something.
It's a pay-as-you-go phone.
I had my moms get it
and charge it with a ton of minutes.
Jude, I can't take...
And whenever you run out,
I will use my allowance to buy you more time.
So we can talk, whenever you want.
Thanks.
?We live because we love?
?We love 'cause we belong?
?Yes, I swear?
?Oh, you heal the scars that never felt a wound?
?And we'll never need their rules?
?To guide the way?
?Love will light the day?
Juliet!
What?
I mean, what would have happened if we told?
You want to tell Moms?
Come on. Let's go.
What?
Brandon, come on.
Brandon, stop.
What?
We... we can't.
We can't what?
Tell moms.
Why not?
Because you know why.
No, I don't. Tell me. Why can't we?
It's too late.
I know.
Within three hours
will fair Juliet wake.
She will beshrew me much that Romeo hath had
no notice of these accidents.
So, to Romeo, a letter of dear import.
Now, be gone!
The gallant Paris shall ne'er make Juliet a joyful bride.
Juliet!
Juliet!
We got a body in the kitchen!
What did you do? What did you do?
Eyes, look your last...
Arms, take your last embrace...
And lips...
seal with a righteous kiss,
a dateless bargain to engrossing death.
Romeo.
Romeo!
?Just close your eyes, love?
?And dream of a place?
?Where no hearts were ever broken?
?No moments to erase?
?In my mind, I see it now?
?That smile upon your face?
?We are nothing without each other?
?When it's said and done?
?We are oceans crashing together?
?But the storm is on the run?
?We are madness, we are beauty?
?We're our own redemption?
?Can't let these walls come between us?
?Our hearts will bleed as one?
?We are nothing without each other?
?When it's said and done?
?We are oceans crashing together?
?But the storm is on the run?
?We are madness, we are beauty?
?We're our own redemption?
?Can't let these walls come between us?
?Our hearts will bleed as one?
?We are nothing without each other?
?We live because we love?
?We love 'cause we belong?
?We are oceans crashing together?
?But the storm is on the run?
?We are madness, we are beauty?
?We're our own redemption?
?Can't let these walls come between us?
?This love could be great?
?But they say it would be wrong?
?I don't care?
?I'd be lost without you?
?We live because we love?
?We love 'cause we belong?
?I swear?
?Oh, you heal the scars that never felt a wound?
?And we'll never need their rules?
?To guide the way?
?Love will light the day?
There shall no figure at such rate be set
as that of true and faithful Juliet.
As rich as Romeo's by his lady's lie,
poor sacrifices of our enmity.
For never was a story of more woe
than this of Juliet and her Romeo.
Why? Why...
