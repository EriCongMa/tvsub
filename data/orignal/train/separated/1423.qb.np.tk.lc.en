oh , my god . mom .
the party is like around the block .
i &apos;ll be gone for two hours .
yeah . that is two hours you could &apos;ve spent studying .
i had been studying all weekend .
no friends , no phone .
just me , alone with books .
i feel like alex .
you &apos;re never alone when you have books .
really ? is that what you want me to turn into ?
sweetheart , listen to me . this is the sats , okay ?
it is not some stupid science quiz .
hey , if science quizzes are so stupid ,
why do you put mine up on the refrigerator ?
because we feel sorry for you ,
&apos;cause books are your friends .
yeah , she wasn &apos;t studying last night .
she was video @-@ chatting the whole time .
shut up !
i knew it .
i knew it .
you are such a tattletale !
girls , take it down a notch , because i ...
whoa , whoa , whoa !
what &apos;s the hot topic on &quot; the view &quot; today , ladies ?
dad , can you just please tell mom
that i can take a two @-@ hour break and go to a party ?
no , ma &apos;am . i &apos;m not stepping into that one .
we &apos;re not playing good cop / mom .
i got it .
hello .
you call for a plumber ?
uh , no , we did not .
oh , yes , we did , we did .
plumber , hi . yeah .
um , it &apos;s right up at the top of the stairs . thank you .
really , claire ?
but didn &apos;t i tell you i &apos;d fix the tub ?
yes , honey , you did .
and i think i was pregnant with luke at the time .
that is not fair .
i &apos;ve done everything you &apos;ve asked me to do around here .
i fixed the step , didn &apos;t i ? look how solid it is !
i &apos;m like shirley temple
and that black guy !
bill &quot; bojangles &quot; robinson .
bill &quot; bojangles &quot; robinson !
i said it first !
so , this is the problem .
uh , faucet just keeps leaking .
yeah , it &apos;s a cracked washer --
if i know my washers .
and it &apos;s , uh , it &apos;s been leaking a little water .
yeah , could be a washer ,
a cracked valve , a stripped pipe .
well , i guess i &apos;m not a professional plumber ,
but i have spent a huge amount of time in that tub .
i can tell you from experience ,
or at least what it feels like in there --
oh , good . you &apos;re back .
i need you to help settle a spat
between our blacksmith and the chimney sweep .
be nice . it took me 20 minutes to find my opera cloak .
i still can &apos;t believe . you didn &apos;t have to rent any of that .
oh , please .
do you know how many times this has paid for itself ?
has it ?
well , our friend pepper
loves to throw theme parties .
yes , he does ,
and this weekend is his first annual
&quot; oscar wilde and crazy brunch . &quot;
we &apos;re still recovering
from his &quot; studio 54th of july &quot; barbecue .
they were fun at first .
but they have become a lot of work .
you have to dress in costume .
you have to assume a character .
i -- i can &apos;t believe you ever dated him .
one date .
it was the &apos; 90s .
we &apos;d just lost princess di .
i was at sea .
oh , cam , can we just ...
can we please cancel ?
i wish we could .
but you know he &apos;s still mad at us for missing passover .
oh . right .
&quot; seder @-@ day night fever &quot; ?
just go get dressed and powdered .
ohh .
pepper has done the impossible !
he &apos;s made two gay men hate brunch .
you know , it might be easier
just to pour the espresso right in the sugar .
every morning .
jay , what are you wearing ?
you can &apos;t go to church like that .
well , that settles it , then . i &apos;m going golfing .
you &apos;re gonna miss church again ?
last sunday ,
you said that you had to go to the office .
the week before , you had breakfast with a friend .
and before that , you thought you had a cold .
that turned out not to be a cold .
because i babied it .
you don &apos;t have to convince us .
you have to convince him .
who , god ?
me and god are good !
how would you know ?
look , you feel god in church , which is great .
i feel god out in nature , amongst his works .
are you gonna go to church next week ?
we &apos;ll see .
i know what &quot; we &apos;ll see &quot; means .
if you &apos;re done with church , just say it .
i &apos;m done with church .
don &apos;t say that !
look -- i &apos;m not going to church anymore .
it &apos;s not the end of the world .
let &apos;s not make a big deal out --
hell ...
aah . aah . earthquake !
terremoto !
vamos , vamos , manny ! vamos , jay !
come on , jay !
girls ? !
oh , god . oh , god .
okay .
this is -- this is stuck !
we &apos;re gonna die ! we &apos;re gonna die !
we better not .
if they find us in these outfits ,
it &apos;s gonna be very bad for the gays .
clair
we &apos;re okay !
dad ?
luke !
buddy .
you okay ?
that thing almost fell on me !
i was sitting there ,
and it came this close to my head !
it &apos;s all right . you &apos;re okay .
you didn &apos;t get hurt .
well , i &apos;m not gonna wait around here until i do .
o ... kay .
wow !
that is a doozy .
hey , are you guys okay ?
yeah , we &apos;re fine . you ?
we &apos;re fine .
that was really ...
oh , wait . hold on .
hello ?
mitch , are you okay ?
we &apos;re okay . we &apos;re okay .
and phil and claire ?
uh , i &apos;m on the other line with them right now .
one second .
hello ?
oh , shoot , we lost phil .
we lost phil ? !
we lost phil ?
hello ?
great . now gloria &apos;s gone .
gloria &apos;s gone , too ?
ohh !
hey , gloria .
ay , dios meo , phil , you &apos;re alive !
yeah , of course i &apos;m alive .
for now .
for months , claire has been after me
and dogging me
&quot; anchor the cabinet to the wall . &quot;
&quot; what if we have an earthquake ? &quot;
&quot; we &apos;ve got kids in the house . &quot;
blah blah blah .
so it finally reached the point where i had no choice ,
but to just roll up my sleeves and tell her i did it .
phil !
dad , get up here !
on my way -- seriously , i just fixed that !
haley ...
what &apos;s wrong ?
mom &apos;s stuck !
you okay in there ?
we &apos;re fine .
the door is jammed .
uh ... well , let &apos;s -- let &apos;s try this together , okay ? - okay .
um , i &apos;m gonna push , you pull .
okay . on three .
1 , 2 , 3 ...
aah ! nothing !
oh , damn !
okay , here &apos;s the thing .
i wasn &apos;t pushing . in fact , i was pulling a little .
it dawned on me
that as long as claire was stuck in the bathroom ,
i &apos;d have time to anchor the cabinet to the wall .
it &apos;s like they say
sometimes when god closes a door ,
he closes it so hard that your wife can &apos;t get out .
so , don &apos;t panic ! i &apos;m gonna get you out !
i &apos;m just gonna go get some tools !
get a crowbar if you have one !
what is that supposed to mean ?
like i &apos;m some dandy who doesn &apos;t have a crowbar ?
well , you did just use the word &quot; dandy . &quot;
&quot; dandy &quot; is a term coined by miners in the 15th century .
phil ?
just get us out of here .
dad , how long is it gonna take to get her out of there ?
long time .
oh , honey . don &apos;t worry .
mommy is gonna be out soon . don &apos;t panic .
wait a minute .
wait a minute . you &apos;re not going to that party , young lady .
no , i &apos;m not going to the party .
i &apos;m just going downstairs .
with your purse ?
come on .
just cover for me this one time , and i ...
i &apos;ll drive you wherever you want .
i want to go to the museum of tolerance .
fine . how far is tolerance ?
i can hear the two of you scheming out there !
don &apos;t you dare leave this house !
ohh , why do you have to be such a psycho control freak ? !
okay , you know what ?
just for that , you are grounded one week !
oh , that &apos;s good parenting !
okay . two weeks .
want to double it ? ! keep talking !
blah blah blah blah blah !
fine ! four weeks ! four !
double it again and make it 10 weeks !
oh , my god !
do you not hear how much you need to study ? !
mitchell , come on . we &apos;re gonna be late .
ohh , i can &apos;t believe we have to do this .
come on , after the earthquake ,
it might be nice to be around similarly dressed people .
that makes no ... the earthquake !
okay . okay . yes .
yes . this -- okay . this is the perfect excuse .
why ? we &apos;re fine .
yeah , but pepper doesn &apos;t know that .
you &apos;ll just tell him
that we have some damage we have to deal with .
why me ?
because i &apos;m the one that always cancels .
hello .
no . don &apos;t hand me that i will not talk to him .
i &apos;m a bad liar . do not hand me that .
he is on the phone right now .
pick up . you are doing it !
i think somebody &apos;s talking . hello ?
hi ! pepper !
listen -- hi . hey .
it &apos;s cameron . how are you doing over there ?
great .
well , the earthquake .
yeah , it was huge here . huge .
so , obviously , we &apos;re not ,
we &apos;re not gonna be able to make it .
why not ?
well , some dishes broke .
you can sweep them up later .
and , uh , well , yeah , i guess --
i guess we could sweep those up , um , later .
our , uh , our -- our hat rack .
our hat rack fell through the window .
hat rack ?
well , yeah , we do have a hat rack .
we thought it would force us to wear our hats more .
and it did .
and there &apos;s water damage .
there &apos;s water everywhere .
a bookshelf fell on mitchell &apos;s leg .
mitchell &apos;s hurt , pepper .
mitchell &apos;s hurt real bad .
i &apos;m coming right over .
no , you don &apos;t need to come over .
i &apos;m coming !
pepper , no !
he &apos;s coming over .
see ? kind of panicked .
you did panic , cam .
you paniced real bad .
you &apos;re still going golfing ? !
god sent you a sign , jay !
what , the earthquake ? you got to be kidding me .
you say that you &apos;re never going to church again ,
and the ground shakes with a vengeance .
i &apos;ll prove it to you .
god , if you have a problem with me golfing ,
send me a sign !
i mean , throw in a little lightning !
put on a show !
don &apos;t talk to god like that !
trust me , if god had a problem with me ,
he would let me know without shaking the whole city .
he would be a little more specific .
i &apos;m not gonna argue with you .
i don &apos;t want to get upset .
vlmanos , manny .
i think i &apos;m gonna skip it today .
what ? !
i like what jay said about god being in nature .
no , no , no , no .
don &apos;t listen to him .
his days are numbered !
think about it , mom . it makes sense .
god made the trees and the grass .
he didn &apos;t make that church .
but he made the people that make the church ,
and you &apos;re making me angry ! vlmanos .
just one week .
can i go golfing with you ?
well , i &apos;m probably gonna have
a latino kid carry my clubs anyway .
might as well be you .
fine ! see what i care ! go !
manny . go change .
sorry , mom . hope you understand .
probably good for us to spend a little time together .
you &apos;re gonna spend eternity together !
ohh . damn it !
i suppose that was god , too !
i don &apos;t know who did it , but it makes me happy .
what are you doing ?
hey , buddy .
oh , just double @-@ checking these straps .
this is an extra .
these babies saved your life .
that &apos;s why this cabinet barely moved .
it fell all the way to the couch .
it almost killed me .
no , it didn &apos;t .
this cabinet barely moved .
that &apos;s just perspective playing tricks on your mind .
like if i hold up my thumb , it looks bigger than your head .
no , it doesn &apos;t . it looks tiny .
you have to look at it from over here .
how can i look at my head from over there ?
phil ?
why don &apos;t you just lie down ?
i got to make sure your mom &apos;s still stuck .
so she -- i can get her out .
don &apos;t fall asleep .
sorry that took -- you filthy ...
sorry that took so long !
i &apos;m gonna go ahead and just take off the doorknob , okay ?
okay !
there we go .
that &apos;s -- oh , damn !
what ? what happened ?
i , uh , brought the wrong screwdriver ,
so i &apos;ll be right back !
all right , but hurry up , phil !
doing my best , claire !
oh , don &apos;t talk back , dad ! she &apos;ll just ground you !
that &apos;s 32 weeks , young lady !
i was at 16 before , right ?
what ?
nothing .
don &apos;t judge me until you &apos;ve had a teenage girl .
i &apos;ve had four of them .
god , how did you survive that ?
girls were a piece of cake .
it was the boy .
every look on his face ,
every stupid decision he made .
the way he sat there , chewing his food like an idiot .
and then it hit me why this kid drove me so crazy .
he &apos;s me .
well , all the more reason she should listen to me .
i can stop her from making the same mistakes .
did you listen to your mother ?
ohh , god no .
but , you know , i had a reason .
that woman was a psycho control ...
freak .
hey , mom .
i brought you some soda .
but i couldn &apos;t find any straws ,
so you &apos;ll have to drink it like cats .
oh ! thank you , luke !
that &apos;s my sweetie .
i was going to bring you wine ,
but you finished the big bottle last night .
okay . off you go .
hold this , will you , kid ?
sure .
you know , mitchell used to caddy for me .
of course , he spent most of his time chasing butterflies .
you won &apos;t catch me doing that .
good for you .
i &apos;m terrified of them .
huh .
look at that . that &apos;s a perfect shot .
and i hit that with a bent club .
so you &apos;re not worried about getting in trouble ?
you know , with god ?
oh , i think he &apos;s got bigger things on his plate .
so you &apos;re not worried about hell ?
let me let you in on a little secret , kid .
there is no hell .
seriously ?
no hell ?
that &apos;s fantastic !
so everyone just goes to heaven ?
yep . end of story .
even bad people ?
yeah , they &apos;re -- they &apos;re --
they &apos;re in another section , see ?
they got this thing figured out .
can i hit this ?
damn it .
you distracted me .
i didn &apos;t say anything !
i could hear you thinking .
i &apos;m thinking about this heaven of yours
that &apos;s full of bad people .
not full . the tiniest fraction .
they &apos;re walled in .
what if they break out ?
they &apos;re surrounded by a lake of fire .
they are fiery lakes in heaven ?
this is turning into hell .
tell me about it .
what are you doing ? !
well , you promised pepper broken dishes ,
so ...
i &apos;m breaking this .
no ! not my frog !
i know you think it &apos;s tacky ,
but i happened to have won this at my first 4 @-@ h summer camp
in a hollerin &apos; contest .
well , we wouldn &apos;t have to break anything
if you were a better liar .
if you &apos;re trying to make me feel bad
about not being as good a liar as you --
what are you doing ?
a hat rack fell through the window , remember ?
one ... two ... three !
mitchell , wait !
i @-@ i @-@ i can &apos;t do this . i quit .
you might be comfortable with all this lying ,
but i &apos;m not .
oh , please . where was all this conscience
when i got us into the first @-@ class lounge at the airport
and you chewed angela lansbury &apos;s ear off .
you know what you are ?
you &apos;re like a mob wife .
you look down at me and my ways ,
but you &apos;re happy to wear the mink coat
that fell off the back of the truck !
how dare you ?
i know . i know .
it really hit us bad .
no .
i &apos;m just always surprised how small this place is .
pepper , you didn &apos;t have to leave your party
to come check on us .
great costume , by the way .
this isn &apos;t my costume .
i just threw this on to help you clean up .
well , about your party ...
oh , don &apos;t worry about canceling .
at least you have an excuse .
unlike steven and stefan .
they said they had the flu .
meantime , i just saw them out riding their bicycle .
oh , pepper , that is horrible .
i @-@ i &apos;m gonna make you a cocktail .
oh , honey . don &apos;t go to any trouble .
i &apos;ll just have a kir royale .
i mean , my god ,
if they didn &apos;t want to come to my party ,
just say it .
i &apos;m a big boy . i can take it .
well , since you brought it up , pepper ...
we didn &apos;t want to come to your party , either .
what ?
well , you know we love you ,
but they &apos;ve just gotten to be so much work over the years , and ...
we &apos;re all out of cassis .
i can &apos;t bear it !
i will make you a bellini .
everybody canceled on me !
and now you two !
for 15 years ,
i have killed myself setting a community standard
with my fanciful themed brunches
mounted at great personal expense .
well , clearly , i &apos;ve been a fool .
no one likes your brunches , pepper .
no one likes you .
you &apos;re gonna die alone !
in a quaint spanish revival outside of palm springs ...
or la quinta .
yeah . i told him .
yeah . yeah , i puzzled that out .
i just don &apos;t understand this bad section of heaven .
what if they send you to the wrong place ?
they make mistakes with paperwork sometimes .
i was put in a girls &apos; health class last year
and had to watch a very disturbing movie .
calm down .
instead of thinking all morning
about what heaven &apos;s gonna look like ,
what it &apos;s not gonna look like , who &apos;s where .
if there even is a heaven .
why don &apos;t we just concentrate
on this beautiful , carefree day that &apos;s in front of us ?
i &apos;d rather concentrate on something you just said .
there might not even be a heaven ?
i don &apos;t know !
you seemed pretty sure of yourself this morning .
so what happens after you die ?
there &apos;s just nothing ?
look , you &apos;re focusing too much
on one little thing that i said .
it was just a hunch , okay ?
a hunch ?
i &apos;m skipping church based on a hunch ? !
all right , don &apos;t freak out on me here , kid .
you &apos;re playing pretty fast and loose with my soul .
listen . i want you to forget everything
that i said , okay ?
some things can &apos;t be forgotten , jay .
do you know what menstruation is ?
because i do .
perfect .
hey !
w @-@ what are you doing ?
aren &apos;t you supposed to be getting mom out of the bathroom ?
that is what i was doing .
that is what i was doing .
this c-- this cabinet ...
was the problem .
how ?
yeah . it &apos;s very heavy ,
and because it was properly anchored to the wall ,
there &apos;s sort of a ripple effect .
it was ...
pulling part of the floor down ...
and then pushing part of the floor up ,
using the bathroom door --
please don &apos;t tell on me .
i don &apos;t know who i am anymore !
who am i ? !
i &apos;m a joke !
that &apos;s who .
no .
no .
you &apos;re not a joke .
you &apos;re pepper saltzman .
i think i better just go .
if anything terrible should happen ,
don &apos;t feel an obligation to attend my memorial .
new york or l.a ..
pepper ?
pepper , you -- you didn &apos;t let me finish .
the reason we didn &apos;t want to come to your party is ...
mitchell ?
seriously ?
who &apos;s a mob wife ?
i &apos;m a mob wife .
i &apos;m sorry . i couldn &apos;t hear you .
i &apos;m a mob wife .
okay , um ... pepper ,
this is a little embarrassing .
i don &apos;t even want to hear it .
cameron still has feelings for you .
go on .
yeah , and it &apos;s just -- it &apos;s very hard for him
to be around you , especially at your ...
magical brunches where you &apos;re just --
you &apos;re -- you &apos;re so ... magnetic .
and then i see the way that he looks at you , and ...
damn it , pe-- it just makes me so mad
that i could just ...
really ?
yeah , oh , you don &apos;t know the pain , cam !
ohh , boys !
boys , i can &apos;t stand that i &apos;m coming between you !
not that i &apos;m surprised .
i admit i have noticed the stolen glances
and the yearning in your eyes .
okay . well , y @-@ you &apos;ll forgive us , pepper ,
if we sit out your next few brunches ?
absolutely .
i would hate to lose you two .
i &apos;ve always thought of you as being like my
sons ?
sons ?
&quot; sons &quot; ?
i was gonna say &quot; brothers . &quot;
it &apos;s like a house of pain !
all right , claire .
okay , ready ?
you ready ?
i &apos;m ready .
all right , on &quot; go . &quot;
okay , go .
all right ? go !
okay , go !
go ! go !
claire !
oh , god , i got it !
ohh ! it &apos;s moving ! it did it !
all right ! we got it .
oh ! thank god !
go .
oh , thank god . thank god . thank god .
phil ?
phil ?
honey -- phil , where are you ?
phil ...
are you kidding me ? !
not the -- phil !
phil !
hey !
what happened to you ? you disappeared for 20 minutes .
we just had to break ourselves out of that bathroom .
i am so happy to see you . get in here .
oh , no . no , no . seriously .
what happened ?
dad was incredible !
he was running around here turning off the gas line ,
cleaning up broken glass ,
and taking care of luke after he ran into a wall .
what ?
i got scared because the cabinet didn &apos;t fall down .
ohh . i &apos;m sorry .
well , don &apos;t worry about it .
no , i &apos;m sorry .
oh ... i was so nervous .
i freaked out .
it &apos;s all right . it &apos;s all right .
i think it was a little bit of a rough morning .
yes .
wasn &apos;t it ?
yes , it was .
i don &apos;t know about you guys ,
but i just want to relax and put my feet up .
at the museum of tolerance . who &apos;s in ?
i am !
you are . okay . let &apos;s do it .
there &apos;s nothing mystical about an earthquake .
pressure builds , and it &apos;s released .
and you just hope there &apos;s not too much damage .
but it makes you realize what matters .
and for me , that &apos;s my family .
i &apos;ll put in a good word for you .
you &apos;re the best , kid .
my family and golf .
if heaven &apos;s in the sky ,
what do you walk on ?
ay , manny , don &apos;t be ridiculous . the clouds .
that makes no sense . clouds are air .
you &apos;d fall right through them .
the clouds in heaven -- they &apos;re like trampolines .
mm , i don &apos;t like trampolines .
they make me seasick .
manny , stop worrying .
heaven is a beautiful place
with sunshine and rainbows and butterflies .
butterflies ? !
ay , no , no , no , no .
