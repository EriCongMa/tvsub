ava hessington , you &apos;re under arrest .
conspiracy to commit murder .
if you &apos;re looking to ride some partner &apos;s coattails ,
you &apos;re gonna have to look somewhere else .
stephen huntley , senior partner , london office .
i want you to find out what the hell that guy &apos;s up to .
i know about your deal with edward .
i don &apos;t need you baby @-@ sitting me on this case .
tony gianopolous got a hold of that video .
i think he &apos;s trying to take over the company .
you told me to take this deal .
i did , and now here i am .
i didn &apos;t know about these murders .
what you don &apos;t seem to believe is neither did i.
you &apos;re not the fool anymore , louis .
mike ross is .
and i can &apos;t take it back .
your future at this firm is over .
this is everything i have on tony gianopolous .
welcome to team litt .
we just admitted to each other that we &apos;re defending a murderer .
it doesn &apos;t really seem like cause for celebration .
it &apos;s not a celebration .
i made a deal with darby
to take over the firm from jessica .
you heard ?
i heard .
vote &apos;s in 48 hours .
she &apos;s not losing that vote .
i &apos;m getting my shit .
i got my shit .
conference room .
five minutes .
what is she doing here ?
she &apos;s my new associate .
so that &apos;s why you made the video .
you seem upset that she led you to believe
that she was trying to befriend you
when it turned out she was gonna betray you .
louis .
you got a problem with that ?
no . no problem .
not as long as your daddy &apos;s here .
do i have to have another talk with you ?
he had a talk with you ?
yes .
but i didn &apos;t feel the need to run to you to protect me .
second choice never does .
i can &apos;t believe it &apos;s up to me
to be the adult in the room .
maybe it &apos;s time we get down to business .
good , because the first order of business
is discussing what to do following ava &apos;s statement .
she &apos;s not making a statement .
yes , she is .
ava makes a statement ,
cameron &apos;s gonna be all over it .
cameron dennis isn &apos;t the problem right now .
the problem is ava hessington isn &apos;t a credible ceo .
the problem is she &apos;s on trial for murder .
and public perception says that she &apos;s as guilty
as jean valjean with a loaf of bread in his pants .
and in case you are not up on current events ,
we &apos;re facing a vote for control of her company in two days .
talking under threat makes her look desperate .
and not talking makes her look either guilty or incompetent .
we need to send the message to wall street
that she &apos;s in control and she &apos;s got nothing to hide .
this is a meeting about
how to keep ava &apos;s company without endangering her murder defense .
did it ever occur to you that , if she &apos;s cold enough
to kill off opposition to her pipeline ,
she &apos;s cold enough to pull off lying to the press ?
i mean , we all know she did this , right ?
this isn &apos;t open for discussion .
she &apos;s not saying a word .
i &apos;m afraid it &apos;s too late .
what did you do ?
she &apos;s on her way to an interview right now .
it &apos;ll run in the journal ,
and then it will blow gianopolous
and his bullshit takeover attempt out of the water .
connelly .
mr. connelly , i do apologize ,
but i &apos;m afraid we have to change the location of our interview .
who is this ?
miss hessington &apos;s assistant .
well , i spoke to her assistant this morning--
yes , rebecca handles miss hessington &apos;s schedule .
i handle her life .
what , so i &apos;m supposed to traipse all over town
because of what she &apos;d prefer ?
not prefer . insist .
insist ?
i &apos;m giving her a forum to tell her side of the story .
an exclusive forum which needn &apos;t be the case .
now make no mistake , mr. connelly ,
miss hessington is the one doing the favor here .
so , if you &apos;d like to speak with her ,
my driver will be more than happy to take you to her .
or if you would prefer to call rebecca ,
i &apos;m sure she &apos;ll be able to set something up for you .
sometime say next december .
go ahead and order .
connelly &apos;s running a little late .
he should get here
at ten past &quot; you &apos;re not giving an interview . &quot;
i wasn &apos;t trying to keep this from you .
you didn &apos;t exactly cc me on the memo .
very well . you want the truth ?
i don &apos;t particularly appreciate being muzzled .
i suggest you don &apos;t think of it as muzzled so much
as keeping you out of jail for the rest of your life .
and what &apos;ll you have me do , harvey , hmm ?
take a week in st. barts ?
because that is not going to happen .
i know that &apos;s not going to happen .
you &apos;re on trial for murder .
and because of that a tender offer &apos;s being made
on a company with my family name .
and with all that going on , the fact that i haven &apos;t made
a statement defending myself is bullshit .
it &apos;s not bullshit . it &apos;s smart .
of course you see it that way .
you think i &apos;m guilty .
i &apos;ve told you before it doesn &apos;t matter what i think .
but if you think saying you &apos;re innocent
is gonna make people believe you , it won &apos;t .
because you know who says they &apos;re innocent ?
everybody .
every day i keep my mouth shut ,
our stock takes a dive ,
and that makes me vulnerable .
i get it .
you want to convince the world
you &apos;re not responsible for these murders
so you can keep control of your big oil company .
that is not what i said .
well , that &apos;s how cameron dennis is gonna make it sound .
ava , you &apos;re on trial for your life .
this company is my life .
and that &apos;s exactly what it &apos;s gonna look like--
a greedy oil exec clinging to her money factory
with her blood @-@ stained hands .
very well .
you &apos;ve made your point .
now i suggest you find a way to get me out of both situations
&apos;cause i am not losing control of my company
to tony gianopolous .
new dress ?
what can i say , it deserved me .
what &apos;s the occasion ?
does a girl need a reason to look spectacular ?
sugar me .
um , before anyone sugars anyone ,
if you two are dating ,
you need to know that we have a very strict policy
in favor of that .
and we have a very strict policy
to keep our sugar to ourselves .
oh , that &apos;s a pity .
i &apos;m partial to a little sweetness in the morning .
well , then i would recommend the bakery on 52nd .
you care to join me ?
i hate to deny you the pleasure of my company .
i think i can manage without it .
since you &apos;re from a different country ,
i &apos;ll translate :
she finds you a bit douchey , love .
my loss .
ladies .
oh , that man is trouble .
it &apos;s okay . i can handle it .
oh , no , it &apos;s okay .
i don &apos;t need you to .
wait . what are we talking about ?
the fact that he &apos;s into me .
were you here ? he &apos;s into me .
then why was i the one getting all the stares ?
haven &apos;t you ever heard , &quot; go after the second prettiest
to get the prettiest &apos;s attention &quot; ?
no , i &apos;ve never heard that .
well , it &apos;s a thing .
are you saying i &apos;m the second prettiest ?
i &apos;m saying you are to him .
oh , the dress .
he asked you out ?
last week .
and ?
i passed .
why ?
why should i go out with him ?
just because he &apos;s charming and hot ?
and witty and british .
and has a title .
he does ?
no .
but even if he did ,
that wouldn &apos;t be a reason .
i told you , rach ,
i don &apos;t mix business with pleasure .
business ?
he &apos;s only here for six weeks .
and he is based out of london .
it &apos;s practically a different company .
and it &apos;s definitely a different country .
so you &apos;ll consider it ?
nope .
what &apos;s going on with ava hessington ?
i convinced her not to give an interview .
how &apos;d she get it in her head it &apos;d be a good idea
in the first place ?
louis .
is he aware she &apos;s up for murder ?
is he aware that most people don &apos;t line their offices
with pictures of themselves ?
evidently not .
you know he &apos;s still got one of his dead cat ?
harvey , leave the cat alone .
stupid cat .
how dare you sabotage my case ?
i didn &apos;t sabotage shit .
you set that thing up behind my back
and you didn &apos;t tell me about it .
until you thought it was too late .
yeah , because i knew the minute things heated up
on the takeover attempt , you &apos;d want to take my case back .
take your case back ?
i don &apos;t know how familiar you are with the game of law ,
but murder trumps takeover .
you condescending piece of sh--
louis .
harvey &apos;s right .
the woman can &apos;t make public statements
while she &apos;s on trial for murder .
trump .
well , if she &apos;s gonna keep her mouth shut ,
then she &apos;s gonna have to step down
or we &apos;re gonna lose this vote .
asking her to step down
would be asking her to cut off her arm .
if we don &apos;t cut off her arm , harvey ,
we &apos;re gonna lose the patient .
she &apos;s my client . i &apos;m not gonna let that happen .
ava hessington is not my client .
hessington oil is .
and they generate $ 14 million a year in billables .
have you not been listening ?
ava hessington is hessington oil .
not for long .
excuse me ?
louis is right .
if she steps down now ,
we can still win the vote and keep them as a client .
well , who &apos;s gonna convince her to do that ?
we don &apos;t have to convince her .
we can just go to the board .
we don &apos;t even have to tell her .
like hell you will
and like hell i won &apos;t .
harvey , this needs to happen .
no , i won &apos;t do it .
this is my call .
i &apos;m afraid it isn &apos;t .
excuse me ?
you and i both know who assigned me to this case ,
and it wasn &apos;t you .
it was the man you chose to merge with .
the same man who has a 51 % share of our law firm .
so unless you &apos;re gonna undo that ,
you &apos;re gonna live with this .
was she pissed ?
i bet she was pissed .
not as pissed as you &apos;re gonna be .
what are you talking about ?
you &apos;re on katrina duty for the next two days .
what ? i &apos;d rather be on latrine duty .
it &apos;s not an option .
okay , then i &apos;m going awol .
well , let me connect the dots for you , forrest gump .
even though jessica gave in on the strategy ,
louis made it clear he &apos;s willing to sacrifice ava ,
and you don &apos;t trust him to play by the rules .
which is why you &apos;re gonna work side by side with her
to figure a way out of this jam .
and at the same time make sure she and louis don &apos;t shaft us .
not bad , forrest .
okay , if i &apos;m forrest , then you &apos;re bubba .
shrimpin &apos; bidness .
harvey ...
if ava loses her company ,
will darby still back you as managing partner ?
i didn &apos;t ask , but i sure as hell wouldn &apos;t .
what is it , louis ?
i just wanted to thank you for backing me earlier .
i had your back because you had the best strategy .
it still means a lot to me .
and , you know , i don &apos;t know where harvey gets off
telling you how to run things .
it &apos;s over , louis . i &apos;m moving on .
it doesn &apos;t have to be .
what exactly are you proposing ?
allow me to be your black swan .
let me do the things that your position precludes you
from doing ,
the dark choices , the distasteful wet work .
you mean like using lye to dissolve a human body ?
i mean using lies to dislodge a pesky ceo .
well , we &apos;ve been told that &apos;s not an option .
not for you , maybe , but as we just agreed ,
it &apos;s the right option for the board .
and harvey and his master lord poppycock
don &apos;t have to know .
louis , i appreciate your offer , i do , but--
but the one time you take my side over his ,
you &apos;re not willing to fight for it .
i &apos;m willing to fight .
i just won &apos;t do it behind darby &apos;s back .
look , i swear it &apos;ll never come back to you .
i didn &apos;t say i was afraid to get caught .
i said i don &apos;t want to operate that way .
now if you &apos;ll excuse me .
need i remind you you had me go behind harvey &apos;s back
to do the same thing with mckernon motors ?
that was not the same .
i get it .
you were in charge then .
you &apos;re not in charge anymore .
all jamed up ?
i &apos;m afraid so .
you just need to coax it a little .
oh , and how does one do that ?
oh , it &apos;s all in the touch .
well , i &apos;ve been nothing but gentle .
there &apos;s a time to be gentle ,
and there &apos;s a time to be firm .
you should see how i handle the fax .
i can imagine .
you know , in fact , given your skills ,
i think you &apos;d probably be the ideal person
to handle my short @-@ term needs .
see , i &apos;m in the states on a limited basis ,
and i &apos;ve got nobody to help me with my workload .
i get it .
you &apos;re forced to do everything yourself .
it &apos;s getting exhausting .
and you need someone to help relieve the pressure .
naturally , i thought of you .
not rachel ?
i think you know the answer to that .
i knew it then .
i know you did .
it &apos;ll be a brief , casual arrangement
whilst i &apos;m in new york .
i wouldn &apos;t have time for anything more .
then we have an agreement ?
i don &apos;t know .
what kind of boss would you be ?
demanding .
but very generous .
generous is good .
as is daniel day @-@ lewis doing macbeth .
you do realize that this arrangement
would involve no secretarial work ?
i &apos;d be disappointed if it did .
katrina bennett .
at your service .
god , i love the sound of that .
your wish is my command .
my wish is for you--
to work hand in glove with mike ross
on getting rid of tony gianopolous ,
keep an eye on what they &apos;re doing
while at the same time limit their understanding
of what we &apos;re doing .
how do you know all that ?
it &apos;s my job .
wait a minute .
i thought you can &apos;t stand mike ross .
all of a sudden you &apos;re willing to work with him ?
it &apos;s my job .
if i ask you to murder someone
n a rainy winter &apos;s eve , how would you respond ?
you want a gun or a knife ?
if you were less attractive , i &apos;d love you .
i know .
louis , why aren &apos;t we just kicking ava hessington out ?
she &apos;d be gone before she even knew what hit her .
if harvey had half your brains ,
that &apos;s exactly what we &apos;d be doing .
but he doesn &apos;t , and as much as i hate to admit it ,
he &apos;s in charge of this decision .
he &apos;s not in charge of this firm .
go to jessica , she &apos;ll agree with you ,
you &apos;ll get the credit , and harvey will be
off hessington oil before he even knows what hit him .
katrina , as much as i appreciate your suggestion ,
i refuse to operate in a duplicitous manner .
then i &apos;ll find us a way to get rid of tony gianopolous anyway .
i might have to let you look at what i &apos;ve got ,
but i don &apos;t have to let you touch it .
touch it ?
this room is a disaster .
this room is fine .
i know where everything is and what everything is .
what are you even doing ?
finding dirt on gianopolous .
you &apos;re dealing with one
of the most sophisticated raiders in the world .
he &apos;s not leaving a trail for you to follow .
oh , yeah ? and what &apos;s your strategy ?
you gonna record him and make an embarrassing video ?
no . gonna play a little game .
monopoly ?
you don &apos;t think i started with that ?
there &apos;s no way to have a monopoly in the oil business .
it &apos;s too goddamn big .
and even if you could , these are all the companies
that gianopolous owns in any way ,
and these are the biggest companies in the oil industry .
there &apos;s no way to connect the dots .
well , do you want to go down the same road
and have another fight
or do you want to try to figure out a way--
shit .
what ?
we &apos;ve been looking in the wrong place .
shit .
shit .
shity shit .
shit .
you &apos;re into the wire ?
shit .
shit .
jessica .
what a lovely coincidence running into you in toronto .
this is not a coincidence .
well , i hope it &apos;s still going to be lovely .
i need you to make it perfectly clear to harvey
that he has no say
in the hessington oil takeover battle .
and why would i do that ?
because he &apos;s making a huge mistake
and using your name to do it .
and let me guess ,
you &apos;d like her to remove herself from management .
she can do it herself ,
or i can do it for her .
but either way she &apos;s got to go
until this trial is over .
i &apos;m afraid i don &apos;t see it that way .
well , you &apos;re wrong .
and you &apos;re overstepping .
listen to me .
she stands to lose control of this company permanently
if we don &apos;t do something .
then do something .
i &apos;m trying , but you &apos;re cutting off my legs
because of a bond you had with her father .
no , because i value relationships over money .
well , i value the terms of our merger .
and hessington oil was one of your biggest selling points .
and harvey specter one of yours .
i &apos;m not going to stand for losing this takeover .
then don &apos;t . but ava isn &apos;t going anywhere .
one more thing .
instead of spending firm money to fly
to another country to question my judgment ,
feel free to call first .
i &apos;ll be happy to give you the same answer over the phone .
this is brilliant .
we &apos;ve got the connection .
we just need to figure out how to stop it .
i already have .
this is great work , katrina . you struck oil .
it was actually mike &apos;s idea .
why do you want to give him credit ?
because if i don &apos;t , you won &apos;t listen
when i say you should take him with you .
i &apos;m not taking anyone with me .
it &apos;s an opportunity for him to see you
beat the shit out of a living legend .
tony gianopolous gets blown out of the water ,
and mike gets blown away .
and jessica hears about it all .
i &apos;m gonna suggest this to harvey .
feel free to tell him it was all your idea .
don &apos;t mind if i do .
oh , perfect timing .
harvey , i was just gonna run something by you .
i don &apos;t have time , louis .
i &apos;m working on a murder case .
i just dropped by to inform you
mike &apos;s coming with you to see gianopolous .
like hell he is .
excuse me ?
i &apos;m not taking anyone .
louis--
and don &apos;t louis me .
this is my case , and you &apos;ve been sticking your nose in it
ever since i got it .
sticking my nose in ?
you only have this case
&apos;cause i was kind enough to give it to you .
you only gave it to me
because you hadn &apos;t realized that you were responsible for
turning ava &apos;s bribery charges into murder charges .
you &apos;re off this case .
go ahead . call ava .
tell her that you &apos;re diverting your attention
from her murder trial to work on this .
yup . didn &apos;t think so .
get out of my office
because i got a meeting to prepare for .
what just happened to him ?
he got &quot; litt &quot; up .
damn straight .
have you seen this ?
it &apos;s an article in today wall street journal
painting me as the picture of corporate greed .
as i told you before , if you speak out--
i have the chance to save my company .
louis litt is doing that right now .
that is not the point .
that is the point .
we can still save your company ,
and you won &apos;t have to hurt yourself at your murder trial .
no , the point is i want to speak at my murder trial .
that &apos;s not wise .
and how many murder trials have you conducted in your many years ?
ava .
silence is damning .
look at this article . i &apos;m already guilty .
if you take this stand ,
cameron dennis is gonna rip you to shreds .
this is not up for discussion .
i will have my say .
then i &apos;m gonna show you what you &apos;re in for .
well , you wouldn &apos;t be doing your job if you didn &apos;t .
have a seat , mr. litt .
i &apos;ll be with you in a minute .
you &apos;ll be with me ?
yes . as i said . in a minute .
well , you know , i &apos;d ask you who you are ,
but the truth is
i , uh ... i don &apos;t really give a shit .
where the hell &apos;s tony gianopolous ?
mr. gianopolous is upstairs .
to get upstairs , you have to get through those doors .
and to get through those doors you have to get through me .
and you &apos;re not getting through me .
well , perhaps i have the key .
this is the balance sheet from one of our subsidiaries .
this is nothing .
sorry , forgot .
it &apos;s a combination lock .
this represents the totality of gianopolous limited holdings .
you control 40 % of
the u.s. radio stations , corn production , interstate trucking ,
and that &apos;s just the tip of the iceberg .
looks like i picked the right employer .
one problem : hessington oil owns enough of those industries
to get you in trouble with the ftc .
yeah . think we wouldn &apos;t find that ?
you think we wouldn &apos;t ?
these folders are out of date .
we &apos;ve already divested .
into this , this , and this .
so what ? hessington doesn &apos;t have holdings in those areas .
they do now .
and if you don &apos;t leave &apos; em alone ,
you &apos;re gonna be tied up with my friend from the ftc
until kingdom goddamn come .
got that , spank ?
then it &apos;s a good thing mr. gianopolous
arranged an exception for us
over dinner with his friend ,
the commissioner of the ftc .
that &apos;s not--
legal ?
yes , it is . as long as we disclose it ,
which we always do .
you think you &apos;re the first lawyer to try to outsmart us ?
we &apos;re not lawyers .
we &apos;re investment bankers .
we call you for the paperwork .
we didn &apos;t go to harvard .
we went to wharton ,
and we saw you coming a mile away .
spank .
oh , by the way , mr. gianopolous is in monaco .
christina will validate you on the way out .
finally cleaning up ?
can &apos;t stay here forever .
how &apos;d your meeting with ava go ?
she wants to testify at her own trial .
are you kidding ?
yeah , i know . we &apos;re working on it .
thought you &apos;d be with louis .
he went to go see gianopolous by himself .
i hope it works .
we have a good plan .
for what it &apos;s worth ,
i suggested louis take you with him .
shit .
as sil would say ,
&quot; just when i thought i was out ,
they pull me back in . &quot;
okay , so you watch the sopranos too ?
nobody watches the wire
without starting with the sopranos .
you--did you really suggest that to louis ?
it was your idea . you deserve the credit .
truce ?
truce .
shit .
you trying to score some extra edamame from the delivery guy ?
please , yuki always brings me extra edamame .
well , then who &apos;s the touch @-@ up for ?
and did you do a costume change without leaving the office ?
i have a number that calls a guy ...
who knows my size .
i need that number .
i can &apos;t give you that number .
oh , my god . you have a date with stephen .
it &apos;s not really a date .
it &apos;s more ... of an arrangement .
an arrangement ?
he has some short @-@ term needs , asked if i could help him out
while he &apos;s in town , blah blah blah ,
i &apos;m meeting him at 8 : 00 .
blah blah blah ?
what &apos;s blah blah blah ?
oh , you know , it &apos;s just ...
this , that , and the other thing .
and does he know that blah blah blah constitutes
this , that , and the other thing ?
rachel . stephen and i communicate a little more subtly--
suggestive banter , double entendres .
we both know what we agreed to .
it sounds to me like you agreed to a hot and steamy affair .
i &apos;m not gonna even dignify that with a response .
oh , my god , did you agree to a hot and steamy affair ?
i have no idea .
louis , what can i do for you ?
i want off this case .
i take it you struck out with gianopolous ?
i didn &apos;t strike out .
what i did was almost pull a rabbit out of a hat .
but the truth is the one good move we had
has been taken away from us ,
and i &apos;m not gonna be left holding the bag
because harvey chose to handcuff me .
louis , i &apos;m not taking you off this case .
but i am taking the handcuffs off .
wait , are you saying that i have your blessing
to go to the board and convince them to ditch ava hessington ?
i &apos;m not saying anything .
got it .
wet work .
this conversation never happened .
what is it ?
have you ever said to harvey ,
&quot; this conversation never happened &quot; ?
louis .
please tell me you never have .
would i tell you if i had ?
i &apos;ll take that as a no .
good night , louis .
black swan .
wednesday , 6 : 52 p.m. ,
it happened .
you aren &apos;t having a heart attack , are you ?
would that put a crimp in your evening ?
well , i guess i could scalp your ticket ,
seeing as it is the hottest of the season .
you know , i practically had to sell my spleen for them .
that &apos;s funny . i heard you got them from a client .
did you also hear that i traded him my spleen ?
i don &apos;t care if it cost you a lung .
daniel day @-@ lewis in a kilt ? worth it .
i &apos;m really glad to hear that .
of course you are .
you found out how much i love the theater .
you don &apos;t think the reason that i arranged all of this
is because i looked into you ?
didn &apos;t you ?
sure i did .
you know , i &apos;m actually to theater
what harvey is to sport .
you don &apos;t give a sh-- about theater .
you love sports .
rugby mostly .
nice try .
we do what we can .
but we are going for dinner
with daniel day @-@ lewis after the show .
you &apos;re kidding .
i may be indifferent to the theater ,
but i know how to get things done .
you are good .
i told you that on the first day we met .
i &apos;m better than good .
what time is dinner ?
10 : 30 .
then we better get going .
oh , the show doesn &apos;t start for another 20 minutes .
we aren &apos;t going to the show .
taxi !
is that really necessary ?
you will be in the deposition .
i don &apos;t care about the deposition .
harvey .
you want to know how you come across ,
you have to see how you come across .
now answer my question .
did you bribe a foreign government ?
why are you hesitating , miss hessington ?
something to hide ?
look , i think what harvey &apos;s trying to say-
you hesitate ,
they won &apos;t trust you .
your bribery isn &apos;t in question .
cameron is gonna enter that plea into evidence .
you have to own it and move on .
and i suggest you do it more believably ,
because when you &apos;re up there
staring down the barrel of 12 executioners ,
there &apos;s no changing your mind .
you think i don &apos;t know you &apos;re trying to rattle me ?
rattle you ? i &apos;m just giving you the facts .
cameron &apos;s gonna rattle you .
and it &apos;s gonna work ,
because you and i both know you did this .
how dare you !
how dare i what ?
this is your idea .
then ask me a goddamn question .
you bribed that government .
what &apos;s to stop anyone with a pulse
from believing you knew that money was payment
for killing those people ?
because life is more important to me than money .
then why the hell did you pay that bribe in the first place ?
because that &apos;s how it works over there .
murder is also how it works over there .
you did it . you know it .
and you &apos;re not convincing anyone .
very good .
finally we get to it .
if you check your records ,
you &apos;d know the reason we won that bid is
that we were the only company who took it upon ourselves
to go to the people .
because you needed to see what your obstacle was .
my obstacle ?
we paid $ 100 million more than anyone else
on the condition that the money be used to relocate any family
who lost anything within 50 miles of that pipeline--
job , home , land , livestock .
anything .
what happened over there sickens me .
i lose sleep over it every night .
and as soon as i am out of this nightmare ,
i am going to shut down the entire project--
the pipeline , the oil fields , all of it .
so i &apos;ve had just about enough of you two wondering
whether i &apos;m guilty of these murders or not .
is that a good enough trial run for you ?
holy shit .
she didn &apos;t do it .
i understand you have a strategy
to defeat the takeover attempt .
i do . but it involves a conversation
about how essential you find ava hessington .
if the only way to beat tony gianopolous
is to get rid of her ,
then i don &apos;t think we have a choice .
if you need cover for the other board members ,
then you can just tell them that pearson darby recommended that .
and i &apos;ll recommend to them
that we retain pearson darby .
so we have a deal .
what &apos;s the matter with you ?
we just deposed ava hessington .
you deposed your own client ?
practice .
you couldn &apos;t convince her not to testify ?
no , not that .
she convinced us that maybe she should .
well , there would be only one reason to even consider that .
she didn &apos;t do it .
no way .
i know . you said , if she &apos;s cold enough to do it ,
she &apos;d be cold enough to lie about it .
but this woman is about to lose her title , her company ,
her whole life ...
and i know that she is telling the truth .
you don &apos;t have to believe me .
take a look for yourself .
what happened ?
he agreed .
she &apos;s out .
it &apos;ll be done tomorrow before the tender offer vote .
then we still have time .
what are you talking about ?
she &apos;s innocent .
what ?
take a look at this .
i figured out what we &apos;re gonna do .
and what is that ?
what we should have done in the first place .
we &apos;re gonna let her talk to the board .
and preempt tomorrow &apos;s meeting with one of our own .
if she can convince us she &apos;s innocent ,
she can convince them to keep her in charge
and vote against the takeover .
win @-@ win .
have louis set it up .
whoa , whoa , whoa . louis ?
yeah . he &apos;ll love it .
letting her talk is what he wanted her to do in the first place .
get it done .
louis , what are you still doing here ?
you put in a long day .
you did a great job . now go home .
i can &apos;t .
why not ?
she didn &apos;t do it .
who didn &apos;t do what ?
ava hessington had nothing to do with those murders .
how do you like that ?
i &apos;ll see you in the morning .
jessica .
i &apos;m serious . she &apos;s innocent .
and what does that have to do with me going home tonight ?
it has everything to do with it .
harvey agreed to let her talk to the board .
that &apos;s all i ever wanted .
louis , if they don &apos;t oust her tomorrow morning ,
they will lose that takeover vote tomorrow afternoon .
she will be pushed out either way .
well , at least i won &apos;t be responsible
for taking away an innocent woman &apos;s company .
you &apos;re not responsible for it .
this is a hostile takeover .
they &apos;re coming tomorrow ,
and the market doesn &apos;t care whether she &apos;s innocent or not .
harvey &apos;s gonna think it was me .
it was you .
and he would have thought that before .
please do not stop me
from going back to that board .
louis , you offered to do this .
you &apos;re not doing this to harvey .
you &apos;re doing this for your client ,
hessington oil .
ava hessington is hessington oil .
not anymore .
jessica .
enough .
this conversation did happen ,
and it &apos;s over .
how long have you been standing there ?
long enough to know that if this law thing doesn &apos;t work out ,
you &apos;d make a lousy boy friday .
i &apos;d ask you to help , but i wouldn &apos;t want to take advantage .
and i &apos;d say yes , but i don &apos;t want to be taken advantage of .
though i am happy to watch .
i &apos;m nothing but a piece of meat to you , aren &apos;t i ?
quiet , copy boy .
same time tomorrow night ?
absolutely .
interesting .
if you find copy rooms interesting ,
you need to get out more .
oh , i &apos;m not talking about the copy room .
i &apos;m talking about you and stephen
and the spring in your steps .
if i didn &apos;t know any better ,
i &apos;d say you were sleeping with him .
oh , my god , you slept with him , didn &apos;t you ?
no .
how was it ?
suffice it to say , i was awesome .
oh , wait , sorry , you probably wanted to know
about him , didn &apos;t you ?
that was the point of the question , yes .
eh .
really ?
god , no .
i may have met my match .
oh , my god .
and the arrangement ?
ongoing .
well , did you tell harvey ?
oh , my god .
what ?
i never thought about harvey .
i &apos;m donna . how could i have not thought of that ?
because you weren &apos;t thinking with your brain .
good one .
you were thinking with your--
yeah , i got it .
so what are you gonna do ?
i &apos;m gonna tell him as soon as he gets back .
have everything we need ?
everything .
where &apos;s louis ?
he &apos;s gonna meet us over there .
we should all be going together .
well , at least ava &apos;s here on time .
what the hell did you do ?
what are you talking about ?
i just got voted out of my own company .
wait , the vote on the takeover
isn &apos;t supposed to be till this afternoon .
well , they had a different one before that ,
and i &apos;m out .
and what i want to know is , did you know ?
ava , i didn &apos;t go behind your back .
well , you may not have gone behind my back ,
but this never would have happened if you &apos;d let me
speak publicly in the first place .
look , ava , my believing in your innocence
wouldn &apos;t change my mind about you talking to a reporter .
then why were you going to let me speak today ?
because an interview isn &apos;t the same thing
as a closed @-@ door meeting within your own company .
well , they had a closed @-@ door meeting ,
and the only person who benefited from that was you .
how &apos;s that ?
i may be out , but you &apos;re not .
pearson darby has been conveniently retained
as hessington oil &apos;s legal counsel .
you think i don &apos;t know this was you ?
i don &apos;t care whether you know it was me or not .
i stand by what i did ,
and i &apos;d do it again .
you mean selling ava out
because of your personal issues with me ?
this isn &apos;t personal , and it &apos;s not about you .
bullshit . ever since darby handed me
this case and not you , you &apos;ve been pissed .
i wasn &apos;t pissed until we had a disagreement on strategy ,
and you invoked his name to cut me out .
i get it .
i wasn &apos;t wrong about it being personal .
i was wrong about which person .
you &apos;re not pissed at me .
you &apos;re pissed at yourself for getting played .
what did you just say to me ?
you heard me .
fools rush in ,
and you &apos;re the one who gave him the 51 % in the first place .
i merged with edward for the sake of this firm ,
just like what i did today with ava .
and the only one in this room taking things personally is you .
tell yourself whatever you want ,
but don &apos;t tell me it doesn &apos;t have to do with darby
and don &apos;t tell me it isn &apos;t personal ,
because you can &apos;t stand being number two .
harvey , do you have a minute ?
no , i don &apos;t .
i need edward darby on the phone right now .
by the way , where were you this morning ?
what are you talking about ? i was here .
you weren &apos;t here .
i was in the copy room .
well , what the hell were you doing in the copy room ?
i was finishing up a couple things for stephen .
you &apos;re working for stephen ?
i made some copies .
you work for me .
sorry .
it was a one @-@ time thing .
well , since you haven &apos;t gotten darby for me yet ,
what do you want ?
nothing . it can wait .
what do you want ?
i want to tell you that i enjoyed working with you .
i thought i was gonna be able to say the same .
if it means anything to you , i told louis
to stop the plan to get rid of ava .
did you know he wasn &apos;t going to ?
no .
but the truth is , even if i did ,
i wouldn &apos;t have done anything to stop it .
is that supposed to make me believe you ?
it &apos;s supposed to make you understand me .
you &apos;re loyal to him .
i &apos;m committed to him .
good night , katrina .
good night .
what did she want ?
nothing .
tell me she enjoyed working with me .
did you ?
did i what ?
did you enjoy working with her ?
i mean , i just kept seeing you guys
working together all the time ,
and you just seemed to be bonding away .
are you jealous ?
it &apos;s not funny .
i &apos;m not smiling because it &apos;s funny .
i &apos;m smiling because it &apos;s sweet .
you didn &apos;t think it was sweet
when i was jealous of you and jenny .
you and i weren &apos;t together then ,
but we are now .
right .
which is why it bothers me more now .
rachel ...
i trusted you with my secret ,
my life .
if i trusted you with that , don &apos;t you know that
that means i ...
that i ...
what are you-- what are you trying to say ?
you know what i &apos;m trying to say .
don &apos;t say it now . i don &apos;t want to hear it here .
here ? where we &apos;ve done pretty much everything else ?
mike , i--
i love you .
i love you .
i don &apos;t want to keep it in anymore .
i love you too .
and in this moment i don &apos;t care who knows .
what you did amounts
to nothing short of insubordination .
did you fly all the way from another country to tell me that ?
you could have just called .
i gave you a very clear directive ,
and you defied me .
do you want to get into it ?
i most certainly do .
when i agreed to merge with you ,
i knew it was 51 @-@ 49,
but i didn &apos;t think you would lord your 2 %
over me like a hammer .
and when i agreed to acquire you ,
i didn &apos;t think i &apos;d have to .
are you saying you regret this merger ?
i &apos;m saying perhaps i should have paid more attention
to the red flags ,
such as covering up the embezzlement of a former partner .
something you were more than willing to use to make the deal .
you went behind my back .
and you stuck me with this case
and then risked losing me a huge amount of money .
i gave harvey this case after already handing you
a huge amount of money .
i am in charge on this side of the ocean .
because i allow it to be that way .
and there it is again .
51 @-@ 49 .
until now i believed that harvey was the wild horse
that couldn &apos;t be tamed , but perhaps it is you .
i think maybe harvey was right .
it is personal .
but i didn &apos;t make it that way .
you did , when you allowed your feelings
for ava to cloud your judgment .
and as you pointed out , i had a partner once
who made decisions based on his personal shit ,
and i will not allow that to happen again .
and 51 @-@ 49 or not ,
i just took 14 million and put it on my side of the ledger ,
