We found our Romeo.
All we need to do is find our Juliet.
I don't want you in my musical,
but you were hands down the best.
Privatization is incredibly effective.
We can get so much more done.
This is Callie, my sister.
She's the girl you loved and couldn't be with.
She's trying to help Gabe get off the sex offender registry.
He's on that list because of me.
Talked to a lawyer and she said it was almost impossible.
I had cancer and I had to have both of my breasts removed.
Since I met Daphne,
all she's talked about is getting her daughter back.
She was a role model at Girls United
and she really worked the program
and got her high school diploma.
She's a good friend and a good person.
She's made some mistakes,
but she's taken responsibility for them
and she's worked really hard to turn her life around
for her daughter.
I'm... I'm sure
both of you have done a great job taking care of Tasha,
and... and I think it's wonderful that you want to adopt her.
I was a foster kid and I got adopted,
and I have an amazing family now.
But if my mother were alive and...
she wanted to raise me...
I'd want to be with her.
I think if a foster kid has a biological parent
who loves them and can take care of them,
they deserve a chance.
And at what cost to the child?
If she can't take care of her.
I understand that this is very emotional
for both parties, but let's...
not speak out of turn.
Thank you, Callie.
Daphne obviously has a good friend in you as well.
Your Honor, can I ask Callie a few questions?
Go ahead.
Callie, didn't your good friend Daphne
beat you up in juvenile detention?
Well, that was before we really knew each other.
So, you were a total stranger when she assaulted you?
She's not that person anymore.
Did you do anything to provoke her?
No.
So, Daphne's capable of striking out randomly for no reason?
No, I wouldn't say that, and Daphne has changed.
Yes, yes, she's graduated from assault to kidnapping.
So I'll meet you at the doctor's office?
You don't have to come.
They're just gonna pump me up full of saline.
Well, I know, but it's not nothing.
It's emotional.
I'm just not looking forward
to being filled up like a balloon every week.
Should've done the implants when they did the mastectomy.
Well, it seemed like a lot to go through all at once.
Definitely not looking forward to going under again.
Well, you know, you don't have to.
I don't want to be awake for it.
No, I mean have the surgery period.
Well, then what would I do?
You would just take the expanders out and be done with it.
Oh, yeah, that would be... that'd be great for our sex life.
Why do you say that?
I'm self-conscious enough as it is, Lena.
You know, about the way I... I look
and not being touched, and...
I certainly don't feel sexy.
Well, you haven't fully recovered yet either.
It's...
it would just take time
to get used to seeing yourself differently.
Yeah? What about you?
You think you'd get used to it?
Still be attracted to me without breasts?
I'd have sex with you right now if you wanted.
Why? You wanna buy me dinner first?
I'm just saying,
it's not an issue for me.
So then what would I do?
Go get a prosthetic bra or something?
If you wanted.
But you wouldn't even have to do that.
Yeah, right.
A cop with a flat chest. I can hear the comments now.
People already think I'm butch.
Who cares what they think?
Yeah, well...
Yeah?
Hey...
Certainly hope you don't think
you're going anywhere in those shorts.
What's wrong with them?
Well, the only cheeks I want the world to see are on your face.
Oh, but it's okay for Jesus' pants to be around his thighs?
Uh, no. You need to put a belt on or change those pants.
What's that?
Letters of support for Gabe to get off
the sex offenders list from Victor, Elena, and Ana.
Victor and Elena?
They wrote a letter...
even after Ana showed up to your party like she did?
It wasn't Gabe's fault.
Besides, Ana's going to, like, two meetings a day.
She wants to make it right and so do we, so...
we wrote letters too.
You wrote a letter too?
Even if he doesn't want anything to do with us,
it's unfair he's gotta live like this.
But since we can't give them to Gabe ourselves,
we were wondering if you could.
Clearly, both parties love this little girl
and want to be a parent to her.
The court is inclined to reunify children
with their birth parents when appropriate.
But in this case, I'm not certain that it is.
I would like to stay my custody ruling
for another 30 days, in which time Ms. Keene
must prove she can find gainful employment
and provide financially for Tasha
without any government aid.
Hey, this is good.
She's giving you a chance.
She ain't giving me no chance.
She knows I can't get a job that's gonna pay me enough
to take care of me and Tasha without food stamps.
She's just covering her ass.
I'm never gonna get my baby back.
Get a room.
Um, brother right here.
So, how's it going with the sets?
Well. Good. Fine.
You don't know what you're doing, do you?
Mariana.
We need to rehearse. Come on.
No, what we need is someone
who actually knows how to build a set.
Look, it's fine, and I got it under control.
See? He has it under control. Let's go.
Ah, okay.
Uh, it's cool. We're all good.
See? That's going to be me falling to my death opening night.
Are you not worried?
No, what I'm worried about is the rest of the cast
is off-book and killing it except for my leads.
I'm off-book.
Well, you're not killing it.
Well, if Mat detached himself from Zoey's face,
maybe we could actually get something done.
Seriously, it's not too late to make a no cast and crew dating rule.
Sure, and you can't date James Dean over there.
Whatever.
At least I'm not macking on Amy Winehouse.
Okay, guys, you're supposed to be in love.
It's called acting.
I don't know if the song's working.
Maybe we might have to tweak the lyrics of something.
Is it my words or Shakespeare's that you're not feeling?
Well, it could be the fact that Juliet is supposed to be a virgin,
and our actress is singing like she's Ariana Grande.
I need a bathroom break.
Are you okay?
I'm fine.
What? I was just giving her some constructive criticism.
Look, I know that you and Mariana have a history,
but you broke up with her.
How is this your business?
Well, she's my girlfriend and this is my warehouse.
Your daddy's warehouse.
Which Nick is letting us use,
So Mat, walk away.
Mat, walk away.
FYI, Mat had a good reason to break up with Mariana.
She cheated on him.
Come in.
Thanks.
So is everything okay?
Yeah, fine. I just...
Your address was all I had, so...
What's this?
Those are letters of support from Ana and her parents
as well as Jesus and Mariana.
Jesus and Mariana?
Yes. They would like to help you get off the list.
So...
Do you... do you have any interest
in getting to know the twins?
It's fine if you don't.
It's just I know that Jesus,
for one, would like to get to know you better.
I don't know how to be a parent.
Well, he's not looking for a parent.
He has parents.
I would like to get to know him.
And her.
But, uh, I don't...
really know what I have to offer.
Thank you so much for doing this.
You're really, really saving my life.
I'm so behind on my senior project.
It's my pleasure.
Great.
Do you mind if I record this?
Uh, no, no. Of course not.
All right, so...
tell me where you're from and how you grew up, I guess.
Well, I was raised in Evanston, Illinois.
Um, I'm an only child.
Um, I grew up in a middle class suburban home
with two loving parents.
So what got you interested in foster care?
Well, when I was about seven years old,
a girl my age moved in with our neighbors.
Her name was Elizabeth, Lizzie,
and she became my... my first bff.
I loved her so much that I gave her my Mrs. Beasley doll.
What's that?
Well, it's from this tv show when I was a kid.
It's called Family Affair.
And anyway, the youngest girl had this doll
that she'd call Mrs. Beasley,
and, like, every girl in America had to have one.
So what happened to Lizzie?
Did they adopt her?
No.
They wanted to.
But one day social services came and took her away.
Why?
Well, they placed her back with her birth mom.
Well, maybe she was better off.
Not in this case.
Lizzie's birth mom lost custody again, and...
she went back into the system.
Then we lost track of her.
That's awful.
Yeah. You know what's really awful? They...
They wouldn't even let her take Mrs. Beasley.
I mean, they took her from a house
where she was happy and safe and loved...
and they wouldn't even let her take her doll.
So, to answer your question,
that is why I have dedicated my life
to reform the system.
for Lizzie and for kids like her.
You are an amazing person.
So are you.
You're helping so many people
by telling your story and supporting this bill.
I actually, um...
I have a friend who needs help.
She's got a daughter in foster care
and she's trying to get her back,
but the judge won't give her custody
unless she gets a good-paying job.
So, I... I was wondering maybe...
is there anything for her at your office?
Oh, I wish I could help, Callie,
but we're... I mean, we're a really small operation
and there are just... there's nothing available right now.
But, um...
I mean, I'll keep that in mind.
Yeah, thanks. I just thought I'd ask.
Thought I'd surprise you and come check out the sets before work.
Oh. Well, the sets aren't much to check out right now.
I can hear you.
Oh, I'm aware.
Hey, guys! How's it goin'?
What are... what are you doing here?
Uh, your mom said that you might need some help.
Yeah, we do actually.
Brandon, this is Gabe.
This is Jesus and Mariana's birth father.
Nice to meet you.
Uh, you work in construction, right?
Uh, yeah. Yeah, happy to help...
If that's cool with you?
Uh, yeah. Yeah, totally.
Yeah. Show me what needs to be done.
Is it okay for him to be here?
Yeah,
absolutely, as long as...
as long as I'm here to supervise.
Hi, I'm...
I'm Stef. Brandon's mom.
Sorry, this is Cort... ney.
Cortney. Um, we work together at the Smokehouse.
Oh, that's right. You're one of the bartenders.
I thought I recognized you.
Yeah.
I'm just stopping in on my way to work
to check out the space.
So, I'm thinking depending on how many people are coming,
we could have two bar areas?
I... I think that'd be... good.
Okay. I'll see if I can work out a deal with one of our vendors.
Well, thank you so much for helping out.
Yeah. Um, nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you!
Uh... okay.
well, thank you for coming by, and...
you know, I'll... I'll walk you out.
So thanks for...
Oh, it's fine.
I have a kid.
I'm not exactly San Diego's most eligible bachelorette.
That's not gonna be an issue.
Seriously, my moms are cool.
I just haven't told them that I'm seeing, like, anyone, so...
but... but I want them to meet you,
Like, really meet you.
Okay. Slow your roll.
I'm not exactly ready to really meet the parents yet either.
Why are you so perfect?
You can say it. I suck.
No, you don't.
And it's not so bad.
I'm gonna need a...
a few cross pieces every 16 inches
unless you want your sister to fall through
in the middle of the play.
Hey, don't tempt me.
You guys don't get along?
We get along... ish. You know how it is.
I mean, you said you had a sister, right?
Yeah.
Yeah, we... we fought I guess.
Do you guys get along now?
No, we don't talk.
After I went to prison, the family pretty much wrote me off.
And she's got kids, so...
It's not like I can exactly go to birthday parties and stuff.
Is... is that...
is that why you... you never tried to see us?
I mean, 'cause you couldn't?
No.
Look, I was 18 when Ana told me she was pregnant.
Wait, you knew?
Yeah.
Yeah, but I was in prison and, you know, she was 15
and I told her to...
you know, not to do it.
She was too young to have a kid,
and I wasn't in any position to take care of one,
And I didn't think that she could do it on her own.
And I was right.
Being with her,
choices I made to be with her...
ruined my life.
Nothing good came out of anything I did back then.
Hey, Jesus, it's time to go home, love.
Wait, no, I still got a ton of stuff I gotta do.
Well, I... I can stay.
Keep working.
Really?
Yeah.
Don't got anything better to do.
Well, thank you, Gabe. That's very nice.
Appreciate it.
Yeah, thanks.
Oh. Uh, the alarm arms itself on at 6:00.
Code's seven, eight, seven, nine.
Okay. Got it.
Hey, babe? Can we have a word?
Uh, yeah.
What's up?
We, uh, we wanted to talk to you about Cortney, is it?
Uh, yeah. What... what... what about her?
Uh, well, I saw you guys kissing in the parking lot.
What, were you spying on us?
No.
Are you guys dating?
Yeah. Yeah, we are.
I mean, I guess. You know, it's new.
And she's a bartender, so she's at least 21, yeah?
So?
So you're 17.
Well, yeah, I'm almost 18, though,
and she's just 21.
Okay, but that's still a three-year difference.
Well... Well, you're three years older than mama.
Mama was 26 when we met.
Okay, well, I'm not... I'm not gonna stop seeing her.
No one is asking you to do that.
B, are you guys having sex?
No.
Okay, good,
and since Cort is older, we're asking you not to
until you are 18, at least.
This is ridiculous.
Hey, is it?
Gabe and Ana were three years apart.
And he was arrested for statutory rape.
Wait, so you're gonna arrest Cortney
if we have sex?
No...
What about heavy petting?
I mean, how far can we go before you throw her in a jail?
Okay, calm down. Nobody is arresting Cortney.
We just want you to be careful, Brandon.
We want you to focus on school and on Julliard.
I am focused.
I am. I... I've written music to an entire play
and... and I'm probably the only senior who's
almost done with his thesis project.
So I've got it handled, okay?
So, are we, like, done here?
For now, yes.
I really don't see why he's being so mean.
I mean, he moved on with rockabilly Barbie.
You know, Zoey, junior...
Never met a cherry print she didn't like.
Are you even listening?
Sorry, um...
I'm trying to track down
this girl Justina was friends with
when she was little.
She got lost in the system and...
I was thinking I could, like, reunite them.
Well, what else did Justina tell you about her?
Sometimes a specific detail can help.
"Mrs. Beasley doll"?
Yeah, it's a long story.
Is that her?
My mother was a drug addict.
The first time I was taken from her,
I was two-years-old
and I was placed in several foster homes
until I was around seven when I was finally placed
With a loving couple
whom weren't able to have children of their own,
and I made my first best friend there.
She gave me her Mrs. Beasley doll.
But one night,
social workers came and took me away.
They didn't even let me take my doll.
Wait, so...
Justina's a foster kid?
Justina is Lizzie.
The friend that she told me about was her.
♪Because what I feel♪
♪There is no controlling this♪
Thanks a lot for telling Zoey that I cheated on you.
I didn't.
Then how did she know about Wyatt?
Wyatt?
Well, maybe he's talking, but I'm not.
Well, Zoey told Nick
and now he's probably gonna break up with me.
So, you can thank your girlfriend for slut-shaming me.
I swear, I didn't...
I didn't say anything.
Then tell Zoey to keep her mouth shut.
Do you remember Karen, art teach from Anchor Beach?
Uh, vaguely.
Yeah, she had breast cancer.
Had a double mastectomy a few years ago.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah, I ran into her in the hall today...
and it occurred to me that
she might be someone you'd like to talk to,
you know, about reconstruction and your concerns.
How do you know she'd like to talk to me?
Well, I also remembered that she was in a support group
and that she actually had a friend who...
who opted to go flat.
"Go flat"?
Yeah, that's the expression they use apparently.
And all this just occurred to you in the hall?
Okay.
Love, I'm really not into talking with total strangers
about this, you know?
I know you're a private person
and you don't actually know these women, but...
they've been through what you have.
I don't...
I don't know what to say or how to advise you...
and I think you need to talk to someone who does.
If you're here to pile on, I already feel like crap.
No, I'm not.
We all make mistakes.
I lost my virginity...
to some guy I didn't even care about.
That's bigger than a mistake.
Do you think I'm a horrible person?
No.
And...
I have no right to judge.
Why?
Have you ever cheated on someone?
No, but...
I've done things that...
I had sex with someone...
and it was wrong...
and I regret it.
But you just have to live with it and...
carry on.
I knew right away that I wanted reconstruction.
I thought my husband would be happier,
though he was totally supportive
of whatever decision I wanted to make.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I've lived my whole life with breasts,
so without them, I mean, personally, I just...
I felt like I wouldn't feel whole.
And see, I personally didn't feel I needed breasts to feel whole.
I just didn't want more surgeries
with more possible complications, and...
I didn't want anything artificial inside my body.
And see, I love my new boobs.
They are perkier than ever
and I haven't had any issues,
and for the first time in my life,
I can go bra-less, so...
So can I.
Sometimes you just gotta laugh about it.
Did you, um, I mean, did you...
I mean, were you ever worried about people staring at you?
Well, I was, but, you know, people don't really notice.
Yeah.
What'd you, um, what did you do
About the... about the... about the nipples?
I had them tattooed.
I didn't do nipples, but...
Oh, she has the most gorgeous tattoo
across her chest.
It's... you should show them.
Would you like to see?
And I'm happy to show you my implants.
I think that would be very helpful.
That is so beautiful.
What made you to decide to do a peacock?
Peacocks symbolize self-expression
and confidence and immortality.
And I guess I like being reminded
that no matter what happens, life is eternal.
Those look great.
Yeah, they do. They look... they look good.
Nice.
And the nipples are... are very dimensional.
Yeah, I'll give you my guy's info.
He is a true artist.
Do you wanna feel them?
Oh, I...
Oh, no, go ahead.
You can give them a squeeze.
Yeah, sure.
Let's...
Wow, those... yeah, those...
Right?
They... they do feel really natural.
It's pretty amazing.
That's... yeah.
Lena?
Do you want to feel?
I mean, you'll be touching them too.
Sure.
They do feel really, really real.
Jesus, it's not... it's because...
It... it...
It's a medical thing for mom.
I'm so sorry.
This is Ellen and, uh,
you know Karen from school.
So sorry.
It's okay.
So I went online last night.
I was trying to surprise you.
I was trying to find Lizzie.
I think it's gonna be pretty hard to track her down.
Because you're Lizzie.
I, um, I founds this video
and in it, you were telling the same story.
Her story.
Why wouldn't you want me to know that you were a foster kid too?
Callie, I didn't tell you I was a foster kid because I wasn't.
I don't get it.
I used to go to these fund-raisers all the time
and I would tell Lizzie's story
and people would listen politely...
but they were never moved by it...
until one day, I told it as my own.
So, you lied.
The story is not a lie.
It happened.
And when I made Lizzie's story my own,
it not only opened people's hearts,
but it opened their wallets.
So, that's why you need me.
You're using me and my story to get money from people?
Well, Callie, money is what get things done.
Without money, there'd be no reform.
I mean, you can say that I'm using you...
but for good.
And you're using me too.
How am I using you?
Fost and Found.
You need me to help you expand it,
get it out there, right?
And you need me to get your friend Daphne a job.
I mean, if it's that important to you...
I can do it.
Nick?
Look...
cheating on Mat was just about the worst thing I've ever done.
It was a mistake,
one that I'll never make again.
I understand if you don't want to see me anymore.
Look, I was just really surprised
at what zoey told me, and I...
I don't like surprises.
Hey, look, if you're ever not feeling...
this anymore, then just be honest with me.
Okay? 'cause I'd rather be hurt than surprised.
Deal.
But I don't think you have anything to worry about.
Come on.
There you go.
See? Fill mine up too.
Do both of them. Ready?
What happened?
What happened? What happened?
Can you take one of the two of us?
Yeah.
Okay. Ready, Tasha?
That's it. Big smile.
All right.
Got it.
Listen, Tashi-bear, I'll see you soon.
Okay, baby?
Every time feels like it's gonna be the last.
Thanks for the pictures. You know, in case...
Hey, no. You can't think like that.
I have to.
If the judge lets Tasha's foster parents adopt her,
it's not like they're gonna give me visitation.
Okay, well, that's not gonna happen
'cause I got you a job.
What? Where?
With Justina.
It's full-time, 800 bucks a week
and, like, health insurance.
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god, oh, my god, thank you, thank you.
Thank you.
Yean, I'm just gonna take pictures.
Oh, right.
He asked.
You're really good at that.
We just, um, ran into each other outside.
Yeah, I can... I can see that.
Hello.
How's it going? Uh...
So the whole cast isn't here yet, but...
it's no problem.
So you're looking for, like, a...
Yeah, I'm kind of going for, like, a post...
Modern steam...
Modern steampunk thing. Exactly.
So what can I do?
Paint. Follow me.
Listen. I wanted to thank you and your sister
for writing those letters for me.
I was, uh...
it meant a lot.
Don't worry about it.
You okay?
You're usually a lot more chatty.
Yeah, well, you don't like chatty.
In fact, I'm pretty sure you don't even like me.
So why are you doing this?
Why would you think I don't like you?
Because you don't think anything good came from you and Ana.
I mean, that's what you said yesterday, right?
No, that's not... look, I...
I... I didn't mean it like that.
Look, I'm not good at this.
I'm here... because I can't be your dad,
but I want to get to know you.
And I want to... I want to give you something.
And I'm probably gonna say and do the wrong thing a lot.
You just got to tell me.
It can't get all pent up inside.
Okay?
All right, Jesus, it's time to go home.
Yeah. I'll go grab a bite
and come back later when nobody's here.
We'll get it done. Don't worry.
Okay.
Is everything going all right?
Yeah. Yeah.
Okay.
Thank you.
For what?
For doing this.
Oh, baby.
So I talked to Zoey,
And, um, I guess Wyatt told Talya
and Talya told her, and, um...
anyway, I'm sorry.
It's not your fault, but... thanks.
Okay. You guys ready to do this?
Yeah.
♪'Cause what we have♪
♪There is no controlling this♪
♪This love could be great♪
♪But they say it would be wrong♪
♪Yes, I swear♪
♪Oh, you heal the scars♪
♪They never felt a wound♪
♪And we'll never need their rules♪

That was it.
I finally believed you guys were desperately in love.
That was...
Let's do it again. Yeah?
Hey, Ma!
Hey!
Anything new and exciting happen today?
Uh... No, not really. How's the set building going?
Uh, you know, there's still a lot to do and time is short.
Yeah?
I, uh...
I decided to get the implants.
Do you hate it?
Oh, my God. I love it.
It's so sexy.
Oh! What inspired this change?
Look at you!
I think it's my own version of... of... of Ellen's tatoo.
The peacock. I think it's, you know, my...
my symbol of confidence.
I've always wanted to cut my hair really short.
Well, why haven't you done it until now?
'Cause I was afraid I was going to look like a dyke.
I hate that I have my own internalized homophobia.
But, um... just really been struggling,
really been struggling with,
with... the way people are going to look at me without breasts.
As if I, uh... as if I'm somehow less of a woman,
less feminine.
But you know what?
Breasts and long hair do not make me a woman.
And what the hell do I care if people think that I'm butch
because they have an idea
of what a woman is supposed to look like.
I just... I just...
I just want to look the way I want to look.
And letting go... letting go of that fear,
I guess, just...
I've never felt more feminine.
So... and I'm gonna need implants 'cause I like having boobs,
not because I'm not me without them.
I love you so much.
I love you too.
And FYI, um, this hair is getting me a little...
Oh really?
Mm-hmm.
We have a little time before dinner, you know.
We could, uh... You know, we don't have to...
We could just get naked and...
Come on.
Come.
Am I gonna be the first woman?
Get up there!
Hello?
Oh, um... I'm sorry if I scared you.
I just forgot my script.
Thanks so much for helping us out.
You really saved our asses, mostly Jesus's.
Oh, be nice to your brother.
Actually, he did a great job.
Well, I... really hope to see you opening night.
I mean...
I'm sorry. Are you not allowed to?
No. Uh, I could.
There'd be enough adults there, but...
Yeah, I don't want to make anyone uncomfortable.
Like who?
Ana and... her parents.
Well, they did write letters for you.
And so did you.
Thank you for that.
I'd really like you to come.
I mean, if you want to.
Yeah, okay.
Yeah, I'll be there.
Uh, by the way, um,
heard your singing over the past couple days.
Got a great voice.
Thanks.
My mom, your grandmother, biological grandmother,
she had a beautiful voice too.
Really?
Yeah.
What's going on?
Police! Hands where I can see 'em!
We got a silent alarm tripped.
Oh God. I forgot. Uh, I actually have the code.
It's seven, eight, seven, nine.
It's okay. My boyfriend's dad owns this place.
We're rehearsing for a play.
Still gonna need to see some IDs.
Is that really necessary?
I mean, I can give you his number.
You can call him right now.
Still need those IDs.
These are fantastic.
Mariana going full diva here,
but not exactly your fault.
Yeah, as though I could've stopped her.
Hey, can I, um... Ask you a question?
Yeah.
Does Cort have a baby?
What makes you say that?
Her key chain.
It had one of those card things
for a... for a baby store.
Yes, she has a two-year-old.
Do Moms know?
No, and I'd like to keep it that way.
So, what, are you going to be like the step-dad or something?
No. But you know what? This isn't any of your business.
Okay. Sorry. Just, um...
didn't want you to do something else
you were going to regret, so...
Whoa. What does that mean?
I, um...
I heard what you told Mariana last night,
about how you wish you could take it back.
I wasn't talking about you.
Yeah, right.
I was talking about Dani.
Dani?
Yeah, my dad's girlfriend.
My dad had already broken up with her,
but she came by the apartment and...
I was there, um...
I'd had a few beers...
and I had sex with her.
Brandon, that wasn't sex.
She took advantage of you. It's like Liam, it's rape.
Statutory rape, it's not the same, okay? I never said no.
It was still wrong.
She was older and you had been drinking.
Does anyone know?
Moms and... and my dad.
Dani was arrested.
For a really long time, I...
I thought what happened with Liam was my fault too.
I felt...
like ashamed and ugly.
It's not how we should feel. It's how they should.
You okay?
It wasn't until you...
that I could be with someone...
the way you're supposed to, without the shame and the guilt,
at least in the moment.
I don't want to regret that.
I don't.
I don't regret it.
At all.
Mr. Duncroft, you're under arrest
for being in proximity to an unaccompanied minor.
Uh, no, no, no. You can't.
He didn't do anything. I'm his daughter.
Take a step back, Miss.
Mariana, it's okay.
No, it's not okay. My mom's a cop.
Stef Adams Foster. You can call her.
You can't arrest him...
Mariana, calm down.
I'll be okay. Just call your mom.
