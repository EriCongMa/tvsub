hi honey , breakfast will be ready in a minute .
hi .
my ha @-@ a @-@ a @-@ nd !
very funny , mom .
i know it &apos;s halloween .
nice fake hand .
we love halloween .
especially claire .
it &apos;s my favorite holiday .
ever since i was a kid , i loved scary things .
if there was a new horror movie in town ,
i was the first in line .
&quot; one , please . &quot;
then i met phil .
&quot; two , please . &quot;
okay .
all right . do me .
do me , do me , do me .
cam , i have to say , i feel kind of sexy .
well , squeaky sexy , but ...
you know i &apos;d be enjoying this more
if halloween wasn &apos;t such a tough day for me .
but i want you to go to work ...
and knock their socks off .
well , my last job was at a pretty conservative law firm .
no one there would ever dress up for halloween .
but apparently at this new company ...
um , right now i &apos;m thinking either vampire or werewolf .
every year it &apos;s harder to decide .
wait , wait , wait . i @-@ i &apos;m sorry .
wait . so people really come to work in costumes here ?
are you kidding ? it &apos;s epic , bro !
epic .
i &apos;m already the new guy .
i don &apos;t want to be the nonpartipation guy , too .
not on my watch .
unfortunately , halloween was marred for me personally
by an incident long ago .
now it &apos;s just a day i have to get through .
so you &apos;ve said .
all right , so , everybody has to be here at 5 : 30
to rehearse our house of horrors .
you guys have your costumes ready ?
yeah , but it &apos;s a secret .
me and manny came up with something together .
i love that !
can i have some candy ?
no .
how &apos; bout you , alex ?
well , i haven &apos;t really thought about it .
i &apos;ve got , like , three huge exams tomorrow .
honey , you can &apos;t just slap something together at the last minute .
you know , if you gave this costume half as much time
and attention as you give your homework ,
you wouldn &apos;t be in this situation .
can i remind you , you have one child who &apos;s not mediocre ?
check it . i &apos;m a scary black cat .
the only person that costume scares is me .
go change it .
to what ?
i don &apos;t know . one of your old costumes .
honey , trust me .
i am sparing you an entire day
of guys asking you if you have a rough tongue .
hello .
hi . dad . it &apos;s me .
i wanted to make sure you and gloria were ready for tonight .
what &apos;s tonight ?
what do you mean , what is tonight ?
dad , it &apos;s halloween . you know this .
calm down , morticia , i &apos;m just teasing you .
we &apos;ll be there .
yeah , but in costume this time .
you can &apos;t just show up with a backwards baseball cap
and call yourself snoop dogg like you did last year .
i didn &apos;t even know who that guy was .
haley turned my hat around and told me to say it .
i thought he was a dog detective .
listen , don &apos;t worry . we got the whole thing worked out .
bye @-@ bye .
hola , jay !
where are you ?
i have manny in the carpool ,
and we &apos;re going to the dropout .
dropout ? you mean that eddie kid ?
yeah , he &apos;s a moron .
no , the dropout ,
where you drop the kids in the school .
she means &quot; drop @-@ off . &quot;
that &apos;s what i said .
listen , did you ever do anything about costumes
for claire &apos;s thing tonight ?
i &apos;m going to pick them up this afternoon .
you &apos;re going to be a &quot; gargle , &quot;
and i &apos;m gonna be an evil village bruja .
i know less now than i did before i asked .
hmm . a bruja is a witch , and a gargle is a gargle .
she means &quot; gargoyle . &quot;
that &apos;s what i said .
as long as you got it covered .
because if claire doesn &apos;t get her halloween ,
she turns into a real &quot; rhymes with &apos; bruja . &apos; &quot;
oh , no . no , no , no . i &apos;m the only one .
at lunch , i &apos;ll let you wear my fangs .
look at those tools .
every year . what a couple of douches .
ohh . oh , no .
hello ?
there are exactly three people in costume here -
a tool , a douche , and me .
and i don &apos;t have time to go home and change and -
calm down .
did you bring in the dry @-@ cleaning from last night ?
are you really getting on me about the dry @-@ cleaning wh-
oh . i have suits in the trunk .
look at that . yesterday &apos;s lazy cures today &apos;crazy .
yes . thank you ! thank you .
okay .
oh , there you are .
hey , i need you in the lampkin meeting .
if i could just maybe have
five minutes .
o @-@ kay .
okay , hey . first legal question .
yeah ?
can i fire those idiots for no reason ?
oh , my gosh .
those are some major guns you got there .
eh , yeah .
why won &apos;t this ...
hey , jerry .
hey , phil . looking good .
thanks . wait till you see what we got planned for tonight .
claire and i are going as corpse bride and groom .
as if there &apos;s any other kind , am i right ?
i &apos;m saying marriage kills you .
judy left me .
oh , my god .
i am so sorry .
when someone your age dies ,
what &apos;s the first thing you want to know ?
&quot; died of what ? &quot; right ?
you want to hear it was something
that could never happen to you .
well , it &apos;s the same with divorce .
tell me it was booze , cheating , physical abuse .
no problem . i &apos;m a monogamous social drinker ,
and claire only sleep @-@ hits me .
just don &apos;t tell me it came from out of the blue .
i was totally blindsided .
i guess somewhere along the way
she stopped finding me delightful .
well , that &apos;s - that &apos;s coconuts .
you &apos;re super delightful .
not to judy .
she used to laugh at everything i had to say ,
but now i can &apos;t even remember what her laugh sounds like .
claire can do it . it &apos;s uncan-
i should go back inside .
i have a dish to wash .
okay , but , hey ...
jerry , if you need anything , all right ?
i &apos;m your rock .
you are not gonna believe this .
judy just left jerry .
oh , yeah . she was so unhappy .
how &apos;s he doing ?
he &apos;s not taking it as well as you are .
oh , i &apos;m sorry , honey . i don &apos;t mean to be insensitive .
i &apos;ve just got a lot to get done .
i don &apos;t find you insensitive . i find you delightful .
do you find me delightful ?
oh , god , i just remembered !
jerry &apos;s supposed to be our porch scarecrow .
can you ask him if he &apos;ll still do it ?
he &apos;s kind of a mess right now .
yeah , but it might make him feel better be around people .
i &apos;ll try ...
but his whole world just turned upside down .
can you imagine ?
one minute , you &apos;re happily married ,
the next minute , you &apos;re completely by yourself .
i don &apos;t need excuses . i need this lawsuit to go away .
now , who &apos;s responsible for the keith deposition ?
uh , well , i was , &quot; shir . &quot;
but , uh , in my defense , i &quot; wash &quot; told
take those stupid fangs out , dale .
for starters , it &apos;s daytime .
vampires sleep during the day ...
which you may soon have plenty of time for .
i &apos;m sorry , but i was told that we didn &apos;t need keith .
who told you that ?
i @-@ i @-@ i may have . i may have done that , sir .
well , that &apos;s disappointing .
but at least mitchell &apos;s new here .
twilight , you &apos;re not .
so get it done . meeting adjourned .
client &apos;s waiting for us in my office . we &apos;re already late .
ohh .
let &apos;s roll .
ah , you &apos;ve really been hitting the gym .
yeah .
what the hell is that noise ?
every time i tried to get out of that costume ,
i got dragged into another meeting .
it was the worst halloween ever .
really , mitchell ? the worst halloween ever ?
you had squeaky thighs .
i lost a childhood .
jay ! this came for you .
oh . hi , honey . what is it ?
i called your secretary and told her
to order you some crackers
and those cheeses that you like -
the tiny , little ones .
thanks . did you pick up my &quot; gargle &quot; costume , too ?
are you making fun of me ?
no .
first , manny correcting me . and now you ?
if i have a problem , i want to know , jay .
honey , look , english is your second language .
you &apos;re doing great .
yeah , you &apos;re not helping by protecting my feelings .
i want you to be honest with me .
okay , well , i may have noticed some tiny , little mistakes
you might want to take a look at .
like what ?
just little mispronunciations . like , for example
last night , you said , &quot; we live in a doggy @-@ dog world . &quot;
so ?
well , it &apos;s &quot; dog @-@ eat @-@ dog world . &quot;
yeah , but ...
that doesn &apos;t make any sense .
who wants to live in a world where dogs eat each other ?
a doggy @-@ dog world is a beautiful world
full of little puppies !
what else do i say wrong ?
well , it &apos;s not &quot; blessings in the skies . &quot;
it &apos;s &quot; blessings in disguise . &quot;
what else ?
&quot; carpal tunnel syndrome &quot;
is not &quot; carpool tunnel syndrome . &quot;
and what else ?
it &apos;s not &quot; volumptuous . &quot;
okay , enough . i know that i have an accent .
but people understand me just fine !
what the hell is this ?
i told you , jay , i called your secretary
and told her to order you a box of baby cheeses .
oh , so now that is my fault too .
oh , yeah , can you tell claire
that i &apos;m not really up for being the scarecrow ?
judy and i used to love halloween .
it &apos;s her favorite holiday .
huh .
you know ?
gosh , i hate to think of you sitting in there alone ,
running through all this in your head .
what could you have done differently ?
what could you have done differently ?
it &apos;s actually a little hard for me to talk about .
don &apos;t push me away . i &apos;m not judy .
i could &apos;ve been more spontaneous .
i @-@ i @-@ i could &apos;ve tried to have been more fun and sexy
like i was in the old days .
spontaneous and sexy . i got it . yep .
and remember , i &apos;m here for you , okay ?
ohh ! son of a ...
what the hell is that ? !
what ? you told me to put on an old costume .
not from when you were 8 .
are you trying to get candy or japanese businessmen ?
change it . go .
jerry is a no @-@ go on the crow .
you &apos;ve been over there this whole time ?
yeah , he was venting . i couldn &apos;t break free .
god ...
you are sexy .
honey ...
not so fast . i don &apos;t think we &apos;re done here , my darling .
it &apos;s okay . i need to get down .
oh , we can get down . we can get way down .
oh , god !
phil !
no ! no , no , no , no , no ! no !
okay .
oh , no .
no , no , no , no , no , no , no . okay .
okay . focus , mitchell . focus . focus .
hello ?
i &apos;m trapped in a men &apos;s room ,
and all i have on is the spider @-@ man suit .
hot . who is this ?
somebody took my shirt , and all the rest
of my clothes are all &quot; toilety . &quot;
i &apos;m screwed .
why don &apos;t you just tell charlie the truth ?
i can &apos;t . i already messed up once today .
and i can &apos;t risk it .
i @-@ i have another suit in my trunk ,
but i can &apos;t get to the car without going through the office .
you know what &apos;s ironic ?
who could really help you right now
is spider @-@ man .
he &apos;s here .
okay . okay . okay .
no .
no , no , no , no , no , no .
no , no , no .
um , o @-@ okay . okay .
behold , my creation .
monster , do my bidding !
i do as you command , master .
okay . mom .
you cannot have a problem with this .
i &apos;m mother teresa .
are you kidding me ?
what ? i &apos;m her back when she was hot .
i will pay you $ 10 to go put on more clothes .
bet it &apos;s the first time you ever heard that one .
okay . you know what ? here . here we go .
let &apos;s just cover you up .
all right , now , i just want to run through this ,
really quick with everybody .
um , first , it &apos;s &quot; trick or treat ? &quot;
and then , phil ...
&quot; come in if you dare . &quot;
right , and then dad does
the thunder and the lightning and the fog .
usher the children in past alex in her cage .
i &apos;m in a cage ?
yes !
you &apos;re in a house of horrors being held against your will .
yeah , i know , so why do we need the cage ?
and then gloria pops up
as the evil village bruja , and she says ,
&quot; welcome to your nightmare .
ah ha ha ha ha ! &quot;
and the cam and haley do their thing .
kids get their candy . they are ushered out .
they think it &apos;s all over , but it &apos;s not !
because out on the porch ,
the scarecrow pops to life .
wow ! for one final &quot; aah ! &quot;
and that &apos;s - mitchell , you &apos;re the srecrow !
oh , no , no .
i was in a costume all day . it was awful .
it &apos;s nothing compared to when i was
you don &apos;t own bad halloweens .
don &apos;t i ?
we get it , cam . hard day .
mitchell , please . the costume &apos;s in the kitchen .
come on .
all right , claire , claire .
before you go , i just want you to know ...
okay . the wig . that , that &apos;s ...
i love you more ...
that &apos;s nice . thanks , honey .
you &apos;re my best friend !
hey , guys .
hey .
wow . god , you guys look great .
thank you , phil . i try my best .
you look very dead @-@ like .
gloria , stop it . i said i was sorry .
oh , no , no , jay .
for now on , i only speak in proper american ,
so i don &apos;t embarrass you .
did she just get back from the dentist ?
she &apos;s mad at me because i told her
sometimes people can &apos;t understand her .
make it right , jay .
we &apos;re all just hanging by a thread .
hey ! dad ! oh , you look great !
oh , good . okay , gloria &apos;s in position .
hi , gloria . there you go .
right back here .
claire , i don &apos;t know that i &apos;m - i &apos;m feeling up to this .
why , cam ? why ?
what happened that is so awful
you simultaneously can &apos;t speak of it
and yet can &apos;t stop talking about it ?
i can &apos;t . it &apos;s too emotional .
okay . some other time .
i was 10 .
oh , god .
dressed as quasimodo on a front porch
with my best friend , timmy reglar , a ghostbuster .
there was a bucket of candy with a sign .
it said &quot; take one . &quot;
one .
timmy took the entire bucket and put it in his bag .
timmy didn &apos;t play by the rules .
it &apos;s what i liked and feared about him .
then the bag broke as a crowd of kids
rounded the corner , saw the pile of candy .
timmy said , &quot; cam did it ! &quot;
trick or treat ?
oh , good .
aren &apos;t you glad yo got that out ?
okay , everybody , our first victims !
this is not a rehearsal . you ready ? you ready ?
yes . yes .
okay .

dad .

no , no , no . first the thunder and the lightning !
yeah , right . i got it .

on our special night .
other children haven &apos;t fared so well .
welcome to your nightmare . ha ha ha ha !
what the hell is that ?

ok , but beware of the fog ,
for you may not be able to see ...
&quot; ahead . &quot;
boop . timmy started running .
i wanted to run too ,
but my hunch got stuck on a rose bush
and that &apos;s when i fell .
i fell hard .
i can see his feet .
okay . here , children , have some candy .
happy halloween .
ok . that was bad . that was a bad start .
er ... first of all , dad , thunder , lightening , fog cue .

oh , help me , help me .
welcome to your nightmare . ha ha ha ha .
now your treats are over here
but with all the fog
you may not be able to see
&quot; ahead . &quot;
and everyone was screaming
&quot; that &apos;s him ! get quasimodo ! &quot;
and then the townspeople started chasing me !
and that &apos;s when i wet my pants !
i wet my pants ! i wet my pants .
this place is weird . let &apos;s go .
mother of god .
ohh ! son of a ...
what is wrong with everyone ? !
cam , &quot; townspeople &quot; ? really ?
i lived on a farm . they lived in town .
they were the townspeople .
and , dad ! dad !
it goes -- lightning , thunder , fog cue !
this whole thing is a colossal fog cue .
claire just doesn &apos;t understand , cam .
maybe she &apos;s never been picked on for being different .
when , gloria ?
when have you ever been picked on
for &quot; being different &quot; ?
ask the &quot; gargle . &quot;
what did she say ?
gloria !
i think she went insane .
she &apos;s not insane . she &apos;s my mother .
i &apos;m your mother now !
gloria ...
i want to tell you a story ...
about a guy eating in a diner , alone .
behind him he hears a woman talking .
he doesn &apos;t turn around , 5 minutes , 10 minutes .
just listening to the woman ,
the life in her voice .
and before he even sees her
he realizes he &apos;s fallen in love .
now , i &apos;ll give you a guess who that guy is .
aw , my dad was --
oh , my god !
you know what ? i &apos;m just gonna go .
no . come on , cam .
uh , if uncle cam is leaving ,
i &apos;m just gonna go upstairs and study .
yeah , i have a party to go to , so ...
ohh ! she punched me in the face !
he came out of nowhere , and he scared
the baby &quot; cheeses &quot; out of me !
hey , you &apos;re talking normal again .
oh , i loved the story about the old man .
well , nobody said &quot; old . &quot;
oh , cam , can we please just go ?
yes .
yeah , go , please . i don &apos;t care .
oh , claire .
no , no .
i &apos;m done . i &apos;m done .
i &apos;m not done . so not done . look , here &apos;s the thing .
we - we have reworks at christmas now
because that &apos;s what they do in colombia , and i don &apos;t mind .
thanksgiving - that used to be me roasting a turkey ,
until the gays took it over
with whatever new turkey @-@ cooking craze it is
that you saw on the food network .
and , i &apos;m fine with that too .
all i ask - all i ask is that you leave me halloween .
yeah , halloween .
i realize it is a crazy @-@ ass holiday
for a grown woman to care about this much .
but it is my crazy @-@ ass holiday .
mine .
that &apos;s a lot of complaining from somebody
who asked for thirds of our tandoori turkey last year .
claire .
no ! no ! not ready to talk !
no .
listen ...
i know i haven &apos;t been much help today .
that - that whole jerry and judy thing ,
it really hit me hard .
is that why you &apos;ve been acting like such a nut all day ?
you know , what if someday that &apos;s us ?
honey !
okay , you - you might not want to hear this right now
after the meltdown i just had in there , but ...
you &apos;re kind of stuck with me .
you promise ?
i do .
oh . that &apos;s great .
trick or treat ?
we should just put out a bowl of candy
and have a cocktail , right ?
yeah .
yeah .
come in if you dare .
thank you for joining us on our special night .
other children haven &apos;t fared so well .
help me ! help me !
she &apos;s doing it .
welcome to your nightmare , muchachos !
no ! no !
but with all this fog , it might be hard to see &quot; ahead . &quot;
yeah !
yeah !
we &apos;re back in the game ! let &apos;s go !
i love it ! i love it !
whoa ! that was for you .
that was for you . i just did it for you .
no , it wasn &apos;t .
oh , and one time she says don &apos;t joke
or i &apos;ll have to give you the &quot; hindenburg maneuver . &quot;
oh , one time she caught me staring off .
and she goes , &quot; cam , what &apos;s wrong ?
you look like a deer in head lice ! . &quot;
in the service , i had a job , briefly ,
handling explosives .
which sounds dangerous , but it &apos;s not .
you store them at the right temperature ,
you have no problems ...
if you tell her she doesn &apos;t have a choice ,
she &apos;ll say , &quot; don &apos;t you give me an &apos; old tomato . &apos; &quot;
or when she says
okay ! enough !
you try speaking in another language !
everybody out of my house !
