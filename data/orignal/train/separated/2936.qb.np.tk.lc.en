you said you &apos;d marry joey ?
okay , you have to realize , i was exhausted , i was emotional .
i would have said yes to anybody .
like that time when you and i got married .
i &apos;m not helping .
so you said yes to him , and you just had our baby ?
that is right . and traditionally , the daddy gives the mommy a present .
but i am prepared to let that go .
so when i came here to see if you wanted to maybe start things up again ..
you were engaged to my best friend ?
well ..
really ?
i thought chandler was your best friend .
well , chandler &apos;s my oldest friend . joey &apos;s my .. no !
hey , i &apos;m gonna take off . i just wanted to say goodbye .
rachel said she &apos;d marry you ?
this isn &apos;t the right room . sorry , folks .
the.one.where.emma.cries
i don &apos;t want to be negative . so i &apos;ll say most of the signs you bought are good .
no , they ran out of &quot; it &apos;s a girl ! &quot; but i can fix this one .
see ? huh ?
so sexy .
honey ?
yeah ?
honey , why don &apos;t you lie down ?
it &apos;s okay .
ross and rachel will be back soon , and then i gotta go to the office .
am i producing them ?
why are you so tired ?
i couldn &apos;t sleep last night .
i started worrying about this big divisional meeting i have today .
the more i worried , the more i couldn &apos;t sleep .
you know , and then i was , like , &quot; if i fall asleep now , i &apos;ll get six hours &apos; sleep .
but if i fall asleep now , i &apos;ll get five hours &apos; sleep . &quot;
no matter what i did , i couldn &apos;t fall asleep .
you know what you should &apos;ve done ?
told yourself that little story .
hi .
hey .
welcome home .
hi .
phoebe did the signs .
you guys , thanks for doing this .
look at all that stuff people sent .
oh , my gosh . look , there &apos;s something every mother needs .
a giant , stuffed gorilla that takes up the entire apartment .
what are people think .. ? you guys , i love it .
hey , so where &apos;s ross ?
he &apos;s downstairs getting the stuff out of the cab .
is he still mad at us ?
well , you more than me .
but he can &apos;t stay too mad at me . i mean , i just had his baby .
that &apos;s not fair . i can &apos;t do that .
i &apos;m not sure you should be here when he comes up .
i didn &apos;t think i should be here either . but somebody said he &apos;d be over it .
hey , what do i know ? i wanted to get a bigger gorilla .
the numbers we &apos;re seeing in chicago , new york and london are solid .
but many of our field offices have reported disappointing yields .
boston is down . atlanta is down . houston is down .
i could go on and on . but instead of boring you ..
i &apos;ll go straight to my 42 @-@ point plan .
walter .
she &apos;s just so cute .
i just want to bite her ear off and use it as a sucking candy .
phoebe .
but i could take one of those little feet and put it in a pita pocket .
okay . i put most of the stuff away .
oh , great . the pacifiers ?
it &apos;s in the cupboard .
the burping cloths ?
linen closet .
the diapers ?
in the hospital .
wow , you guys got a hospital ? fancy .
no , i left the diapers at the hospital .
there &apos;s some in the bag , but i &apos;ll run out and get some more .
all right , thanks .
could you stop at the coffeehouse and get me a muffin ?
sure . what kind ?
let me think .
what do i want ?
what do i want ?
please , take your time . it &apos;s an important decision , not like ..
say , i don &apos;t know , deciding to marry someone . this is about a muffin .
blueberry .
blueberry it is .
thank you .
wow , he &apos;s not letting this go , is he ?
god , how long do you think that &apos;s gonna last ?
i don &apos;t know . he got over the &quot; we were on a break &quot; thing quickly .
you know what , i can &apos;t worry about it right now .
because i &apos;ve got the cutie little baby .
i can &apos;t believe how much i love her . i mean , i can &apos;t get enough of her .
like , right now ? i miss her . i actually miss her .
you know , that &apos;s her ?
i know . i know , but she &apos;s sleeping .
it &apos;s not like when she &apos;s awake and i can see her stretch and wiggle .
oh , my god , have you seen her yawn ?
it &apos;s so cute .
i know .
when do you think she &apos;s gonna wake up ?
she told me to ring her if she &apos;s not up by 11 .
she has a job interview .
okay , but the clouds part when she yawns .
god , look at her sleeping . i love her so much .
i think i &apos;m gonna wake her up .
rach , no .
you know , you &apos;re never supposed to wake a sleeping baby .
well , i can do whatever i want . i made her .
come on , little girl . yes . hello , emma . hello . hi .
well , i would say i told you so , but she &apos;s kind of doing that for me .
i &apos;m sorry . mommy &apos;s so sorry . go back to sleep .
go back to sleep .
it breaks your heart , doesn &apos;t it ?
it really does .
how long do you think we have to stay ?
okay , if everyone &apos;s onboard , it &apos;s settled .
chandler ?
chandler ?
yeah .
are you onboard ?
yes .
well , then problem solved . chandler will run our office in tulsa .
you &apos;re gonna love oklahoma .
all right . we already tried feeding her , changing her , burping her ..
try this one . &quot; go back in time and listen to phoebe . &quot;
all right , here &apos;s something .
what ?
it says to try holding the baby close to your body ..
and then swing her rapidly from side to side .
okay .
it worked !
no . just stopped to throw up a little bit .
mon , what am i gonna do ?
it &apos;s been hours , and it won &apos;t stop crying .
she , rach . not it . she .
yeah . i &apos;m not so sure .
oh , my god , i &apos;m losing my mind .
yeah , no kidding .
all right , this just proves no good can come from having sex with ross !
hey , gunther . can i get a couple of blueberry muffins to go ?
diapers , huh ?
yep .
so i guess rachel had your baby ?
yep . can you believe it ?
nope .
i can &apos;t even believe she slept with you in the first place .
you mean , like ..
hey .
i know you &apos;re pissed at me , but we have to talk about this .
actually , we don &apos;t .
fine . okay . but i gotta say , technically , i didn &apos;t even do anything wrong .
what ? you didn &apos;t do anything wrong ?
i said i didn &apos;t technically .
okay .
let &apos;s put aside the fact that you &quot; accidentally .. &quot;
picked up my grandmother &apos;s ring and you &quot; accidentally &quot; proposed to rachel .
can i just stop you there for a second ?
when people do this :
i don &apos;t really know what that means .
you were saying ?
and i could even understand that you couldn &apos;t tell rachel .
but why couldn &apos;t you tell me ? you had all day to , and you didn &apos;t .
i know . i should &apos;ve . &quot; i &apos;m sorry . &quot;
not using it right , joe .
&quot; i &apos;m sorry . &quot;
i &apos;m gonna go .
no , come on .
ross , we have to get past this .
give me the bag .
no , i don &apos;t know what else to do . i said i &apos;m sorry , now ..
now you should scream at me or curse me or hit me .
i &apos;m not gonna hit you .
you &apos;ll feel better . i &apos;ll feel better .
you know you want to , i can see it in your eyes .
i don &apos;t .
a little bit .
no .
little bit .
no .
a little bit more .
give me the bag . give me the bag .
no , hit me . hit me .
give me the bag . i &apos;m not kidding .
hit me .
no .
hit me . hit me . hit me !
you ducked !
i &apos;m sorry ! it was a reflex !
oh , my god ! this really hurts !
i couldn &apos;t help it .
when a fist comes at your face , you duck . look .
what is the matter with you ?
you were supposed to duck ! why didn &apos;t you ?
let &apos;s talk on the way to the hospital .
good . yeah , maybe while we &apos;re there , they can check your reflexes .
try feeding her again .
i already fed her .
i know . that &apos;s why i said , &quot; again ! &quot;
you guys , we can &apos;t turn on each other , okay ?
that &apos;s just what she wants .
hi .
hey .
i told you you shouldn &apos;t have let her watch terms of endearment .
can i talk to you outside ?
just stay here .
i &apos;m gonna check her diaper . phoebe , you want to come ?
i &apos;m kind of part of this .
actually , it &apos;s a husband @-@ and @-@ wife kind of thing .
i knew i should &apos;ve married chandler .
okay , what &apos;s up ?
okay .
you know we said it would be fun to move to paris for a year ?
and you could study french cooking , and i could write ..
and we could picnic along the seine , and go wine @-@ tasting in bordeaux .
yeah .
okay .
you know how people say that tulsa ..
is the paris of oklahoma ?
what ? who says that ?
people who have never been to paris ?
well , what &apos;s going on ?
we &apos;re moving to tulsa .
excuse me ?
okay .
ms. mckenna , she kind of works above my boss .
i think you actually met her .
don &apos;t care . get back to tulsa .
she asked me to move to tulsa and be president of our office there .
and i was sleeping and apparently said yes .
tulsa , oklahoma ?
the sooner state .
whatever that is .
chandler , i don &apos;t even want to see the musical oklahoma .
&quot; oh , what a beautiful morning , &quot; &quot; surrey with the fringe on top &quot; ?
are you trying to tell me we &apos;re moving to oklahoma or that you &apos;re gay ?
i don &apos;t think i can get out of this .
oh , my god !
but you don &apos;t know ..
it could be like paris . you can still take a cooking class ..
at oral roberts university .
all right , not that this matters , but did they at least offer you a huge raise ?
no . but they are going to lease us a ford focus .
i &apos;ll get out of it .
thank you .
what is wrong with emma ?
she misunderstood .
she thought she was moving to tulsa .
ma &apos;am , do you have a minute ?
i kind of have some bad news . i don &apos;t think i can move to tulsa .
what ?
it &apos;s a funny story , actually .
i kind of fell asleep in the meeting this morning .
so when i said i &apos;d move to tulsa , i didn &apos;t really know what i was saying .
you fell asleep ?
but only because i was up all night worried about this meeting .
isn &apos;t that funny ?
irony . not a fan ? all right .
see , here &apos;s the thing .
i went home and told my wife about tulsa , and she won &apos;t go .
see me , i love tulsa . tulsa is heaven . tulsa is ltaly .
please don &apos;t make me go there .
chandler , i ..
i know that you &apos;re upset ..
but i just .. i would really rather just stay here .
not here in your office ..
here at the company ..
where i &apos;m rapidly feeling unwelcome .
no , look , carol . can i call you carol ?
why would i when your name is elaine ?
what a great picture of your son . strapping .
that &apos;s a picture of your daughter , isn &apos;t it ?
well , she &apos;s lovely . i like a girl with a strong jaw .
i &apos;ll call you from tulsa .
hey . so how is it ?
i broke my thumb .
your thumb ?
that &apos;s weird . are you sure you &apos;re punching right ?
make a fist .
maybe later .
ross , i feel terrible .
you know what , you can go . i just have to fill out some forms .
you want me to help you with that ?
why , does it look like i &apos;m having trouble with my misshapen claw ?
name ?
no , i know ross . but what &apos;s it short for ?
you know , like rossell .
or rosstrophor .
just ross .
it &apos;s pretty .
okay , date of birth ?
you know my birthday .

may .. tember ?
october 18 .
occupation ? dinosaurs .
actually , i &apos;m a paleon .. dinosaurs is fine .
the drawing is not .
all right , who do you want as your emergency contact ?
rachel , i guess .
okay . relationship ?
boy , this could take a while .
just put roommate .
come on .
you guys are more than that . you &apos;re gonna get together , right ?
i don &apos;t think that we are .
but you two are supposed to be together .
well , i thought so too . but then she said she &apos;d marry you .
come on , ross , that didn &apos;t mean anything .
she &apos;d just had the baby . she was freaked out about doing it alone .
she would have said yes to anybody .
yeah , that &apos;s what she said .
so ?
so i don &apos;t want to be just anybody .
wow .
you know what ?
it &apos;s better this way anyway .
i don &apos;t know what i was thinking , going down that road again with us .
it &apos;s just much easier if we &apos;re just friends who have a kid .
really ?
yeah .
and you &apos;re okay with that ?
yes . that &apos;s what we always planned .
and if you have a plan , you should stick to it .
that &apos;s why they call them plans . hello ?
i &apos;m fine .
hey , for what it &apos;s worth ..
with rachel , i don &apos;t think you &apos;ll ever be just &quot; anybody . &quot;
hey , there you go .
&quot; thanks . &quot;
oh , my god . how long has she been crying ?
about a week and a half .
well , it looks like you guys got it under control , so i &apos;m just gonna go .
no ? really ? misery really does love company ?
all right .
try holding her a different way .
look , i &apos;m doing the best i can .
anyone else is welcome to try .
all right , i &apos;ll try . fine .
yes . okay . okay .
here you go .
hey . oh , gosh .
nothing works with this child !
god , what am i gonna do , you guys ? i can &apos;t even comfort my own baby .
i &apos;m the worst mother ever .
no , you &apos;re just new at this .
you &apos;ll get better . think about your first day at work .
that couldn &apos;t have been easy , but you figured that out .
yeah , i don &apos;t think dressing provocatively is going to help me here !
god , just please take her .
okay , i &apos;ll take her . come on .
oh , boy , i have to go to the bathroom .
i have to go scream into a pillow .
bouncy . bouncy baby . bouncy baby .
oh , baby , baby . oh , baby , baby .

it worked . oh , baby , baby , baby . oh , baby , baby , baby .
you must be a fireball in bed !
i can &apos;t believe it . she &apos;s asleep . i got her to go to sleep .
i have actual magical powers .
i can hear traffic and birds .
i can hear the voices in my head again .
i &apos;m kidding .
oh , my god ! you got her to stop crying !
yes , i did . i &apos;m monica , super aunt .
you are the official baby @-@ crier stopper .
yes , i am .
you &apos;re never leaving the apartment .
say what ?
that &apos;s your new job , day or night . she starts crying , i need you here .
no , no , no .
thankfully , you don &apos;t need me at all .
so okay . hey , super aunt ? see you later .
rachel ? let &apos;s give it six to eight months .
okay , so listen , i &apos;m gonna go lay down .
what ?
the book says whenever she &apos;s sleeping , i should be sleeping .
so ..
thank you .
hey .
we just got her to go to sleep .
so there can &apos;t be any yelling ?
no .
we &apos;re moving to tulsa .
what ?
i can &apos;t .. i can &apos;t hear .
hey .
hey . where have you been ?
what happened to you ?
i had a little thing with joey .
if you think this is bad , you should see him .
no , ross , this is not good .
we have to talk about this joey thing . please sit .
all right , you have got to get over this joey thing .
okay ? i never really wanted to marry joey , okay ?
okay .
you know what i really , really want ?
what , rach ?
i wanna sleep .
i wanna eat . i wanna take a shower .
i mean , before she wakes up , and we gotta do this all over again .

you want me to get that ?
no , that &apos;s really okay .
