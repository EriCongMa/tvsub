i was hoping maybe you &apos;d go with me .
to homecoming ?
i mean , once she finds out the truth about you , she &apos;ll hate you .
who &apos;s gonna tell her ?
i &apos;m wearing a silver strapless dress .
can &apos;t wait to see you in it .
what are you talking about ?
i &apos;m talking about spencer ,
you know , dating you to piss off our dad .
i know it &apos;s over , i know that !
but--i just , i can &apos;t stand the idea
of you walking around and hating me .
i could never hate you .
you know , this is typical hanna .
she makes a big deal about coming
to this thing together , and then she ditches me .
is that jenna &apos;s file ?
no , i got toby &apos;s .
so that &apos;s what ali had on him ?
it &apos;s enough to want her dead .
and us .
i figured out what toby &apos;s tattoo means .
what ?
&quot; 901 free at last ? &quot;
it &apos;s september 1st .
that &apos;s the day ali disappeared .
i &apos;m not hiding anything .
then look me in the eye
and tell me you have no feelings for me .
did you come with the wrong person to homecoming ?
we &apos;ve all got secrets , emily .
leave me alone !
emily ?
emily ?
emily ?
em ! are you up here ?
emily ?
um , why don &apos;t we split up ?
um , why don &apos;t we not ?
hanna , you can come with me .
why do i have to be alone ?
fine . we &apos;ll split up together .
who are you calling ?
i &apos;m trying em until she picks up .
emily ?
is that blood ?
hanna , don &apos;t go there .
why not ? she was up here with toby .
it was all in his shrink &apos;s file .
toby and jenna had a relationship .
way beyond step @-@ siblings .
yeah , they ... were involved .
romantically ?
i doubt i &apos;d call it romantic .
i doubt she had much of a choice .
and that &apos;s what alison saw
when she threw the stink bomb .
yeah , and she threatened to expose toby ,
which is probably why he wanted her dead .
and not just her--us . you .
you don &apos;t believe us ?
i do , i ...
i just don &apos;t get it .
if toby killed alison and wanted to do the same to me ,
then why am i sitting in my bed
and not in a body bag ?
something about this doesn &apos;t make sense .
the guy just took her to the hospital
and left her there .
the hospital security cameras confirmed it .
her date handed her over to a nurse and ran off .
no , that doesn &apos;t sound like ben .
he would &apos;ve called me .
ben ? who &apos;s ben ?
her boyfriend . her date .
according to the school &apos;s guest list ,
she went with toby cavanaugh .
you didn &apos;t know this .
no . yes ! of course i knew that .
i just--i forgot .
so where is toby now ? do you know ?
we don &apos;t know . looks like he came home ,
traded in the family car for his motorcycle , and took off .
has emily said anything more about how she was hurt ?
i told the police
that when i went out for air , i tripped .
why didn &apos;t you just tell them he attacked you ?
i didn &apos;t want to say anything
until i talked to you guys first .
well , the truth is in the file .
hey , is she allowed visitors ?
yeah , go on up , but just for a little bit ,
&apos;cause she really needs her rest , okay ?
mrs. fields , we only have a few questions for her .
look , whatever emily told you is what happened .
well , maybe she remembers more this morning .
she might be protecting this kid .
she might be afraid of him .
officer , my daughter doesn &apos;t lie .
ma &apos;am , everybody lies .
you can tell them everything now .
she can &apos;t tell them everything .
you have to leave out the file .
fine . leave out the file .
who knew rosewood had this many cops ?
i went to put this back , and they were outside
the doctor &apos;s office talking to toby &apos;s shrink .
they know this was stolen .
can i see that ?
if anyone saw me go into that building
last night , i am so hosed .
is that from-- ?
no , my mom .
&quot; ask your father if he plans
to take the car in this week . &quot;
my parents have gone
from not talking to not texting .
ugh , this sucks .
i better go home .
yeah , we should probably go , too .
uh , no . i just got here .
hey , what do i do with that ?
just shove it in your locker tomorrow .
we &apos;ll figure it out later . bye .
feel better , em .
is that the car you won outside ?
okay , how do you go to homecoming ,
crack your head open ,
and then win a corolla in a raffle ?
i need to talk to you about your karma .
why did you think i would take maya to the dance ?
what ?
you thought i wanted her as my date . why ?
&quot; a &quot; sent me a picture ...
of you and maya kissing .
so , can i just ask ?
i mean , you took toby to the dance ,
but then you took that picture with maya .
i think i know what i want ,
but if i say yes to maya , everything would change .
you know it would .
yeah , it would .
you wouldn &apos;t have to pretend you &apos;re someone you &apos;re not .
but what if i am wrong ?
what if i &apos;m not ... that person ?
emily , you &apos;re not signing a contract .
you were emily dating ben ,
and now you &apos;re emily dating maya .
we love emily . no one cares who you &apos;re with .
really ? have you met my parents ...
mr. and mrs. military and their perfect daughter .
um , hi . i &apos;m looking for alex ?
spencer ? what are you doing back here ?
looking for you .
the guy in the pro shop said you were on kitchen duty .
general manager fired 12 people this morning .
why ?
turns out our laundry service
was laundering more than napkins ,
so i get to be the sous chef today .
um , can you take a break so we can talk ?
i need to finish this .
i really have to explain about last night .
don &apos;t worry , your sister already did that .
no , my sister lied !
you can &apos;t be back here .
this is staff only . no members allowed .
look , i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;ll be gone in just a minute .
can we at least try it again ?
i owe you a complete do @-@ over .
you &apos;re violating , like ,
a million health codes right now .
i &apos;ve already had my shots ,
and i won &apos;t touch the tartar sauce , okay ?
you wanna get canned , too ?
it &apos;s okay .
ooh . got stephanie mad at you .
okay , i &apos;ll worry about that
if i ever order the clam chowder .
another chance ?
tomorrow night , please .
all right .
only if i get to plan the whole night out start to finish
and you go along with whatever i say .
sounds kind of dangerous .
only to someone who &apos;s used to running the show .
all right , you &apos;re on .
this is ezra . sorry i &apos;m not here .
you know what to do .
hi , it &apos;s-- it &apos;s me .
i called and left a message on your cell , and ...
um ... can you just call me when you get this ?
thanks . i &apos;ll talk to you later . bye .
did dad get you flowers ?
no , uh , these came for you .
who are they from ?
uh , dad &apos;s gonna drive over to practice
and stay for the game .
should i save you a seat ?
uh , honey , i think i &apos;m gonna have to miss this one .
whatever .
you don &apos;t have to sit with dad .
yeah , but that would look worse than not going at all ,
wouldn &apos;t it ?
so , you &apos;re awake .
am i ?
yeah , i , uh , i told jenna
that you already had a lot of visitors today ,
but she insisted .
she and her mother baked you some cookies .
they taste even better with milk .
you have milk , don &apos;t you ?
yeah . yes .
of course we have milk .
how are you feeling ?
why are you here ?
i &apos;m worried about tby , and i think you &apos;re
the only person who knows where he is .
sit , shadow .
um , h @-@ how would i know ?
because you &apos;re one of the few people that he trusted .
look , emily , toby is troubled .
i &apos;m really ... afraid of what he might do .
what do you mean ?
now the police are looking for that file ,
and people think that he &apos;s--
if it falls into the wrong hands , i--
i don &apos;t understand .
i would &apos;ve thought you would &apos;ve been relieved
that he was gone .
so you &apos;ve read it .
your friends have shared it with you .
no one &apos;s gonna tell .
well , you say that ,
but secrets have a way of getting out ...
like what alison shared
when she visited me at the hospital .
i &apos;ve kept quiet about a lot , emily .
the least you can do is get me that file .
you owe me that much .
you said 1 : 30 , right ?
am i early ?
you are perfect , i mean , like , on time .
well , the custodian didn &apos;t even want to let me in .
you told him we were doing a make @-@ up picture , right ?
who , carl ? yeah , twice .
he &apos;s out of it .
thirty years of breathing floor wax
does wicked things to your brain .
then there &apos;s the vodka .
ugh . i got three hours of sleep last night .
i look like something carl coughed up .
well , i think you look even better than you did last night ,
if that &apos;s , like , possible .
um , we &apos;re sure sean &apos;s coming to this ?
yeah , why wouldn &apos;t he be ?
he &apos;s not really happy with me ...
not being there when they called our names , and ...
is that the crown ?
jeez , it &apos;s so tiny .
i can make it look bigger in the picture .
you know , if you tilt your head to the right--
no , it &apos;s not that , it &apos;s just ...
it always seemed so huge .
you know , last year &apos;s picture of
the homecoming queen outside the gym .
yeah , i know , i took it .
but jessica wylie is kind of a pinhead .
although her head did get a lot bigger after she won .
it happens .
so , uh , we gonna do this or not ?
i got a basketball game happening .
got it . if you guys wouldn &apos;t mind standing ... near the backdrop .
oh , go ahead , answer it .
i &apos;m sure it that pulls rank over me .
hanna , where are you ?
call me . jenna came--
so , whenever you get here , just ...
whenever you get this , just give me a call . thanks .
what was that all about ?
who were you talking to ?
um , hanna borrowed my lip gloss last night .
if i don &apos;t hound her , i &apos;ll never get it back .
mom , you don &apos;t have to baby @-@ sit me .
you know what ?
you &apos;re not gonna be needing that today .
just you and me .
excellent . excellent .
uh , sean , could you scooch a little bit closer to hanna
and put your hands on her hips ?
yep , that &apos;s it . that &apos;s it .
okay , heads up , shoulders back .
think camelot .
just take the picture .
you know , i &apos;m just not loving this light .
look , i said i was sorry .
it wasn &apos;t about you . i was dealing with emily .
you &apos;re crooked .
what ?
your crown .
okay , much , much better .
uh ... ready , your majesties ?
smile for the peasants .
smile , sean .
did you think i wouldn &apos;t let you go to homecoming
if i knew you were going with toby cavanaugh ?
what ?
you heard me .
yes .
you know what ? you &apos;re right .
i wouldn &apos;t have . that guy is trouble .
people cross the street to the other side
when they see him coming .
i don &apos;t . i didn &apos;t ...
i just thought he was misunderstood .
different .
different . you know what , i think his stepsister
probably thought he was different , too ,
and now she needs a seeing @-@ eye dog .
he didn &apos;t do that . it was an accident .
how do you know that , emily ?
and what about last night ?
was that an accident as well ?
come on , how many guys drop their dates off at the hospital
and then run away ?
what &apos;s he trying to hide ?
mom ...
honey , did he try to pressure you into something
you weren &apos;t ready for ?
that &apos;s not what happened .
well , then , what happened ?
what happened , emily ?
why don &apos;t you start by telling me that .
toby cavanaugh didn &apos;t get sent away for a year
because he rolled through a stop sign .
do you have any ideas what our neighbors think of him ,
what they &apos;re gonna think of you ?
i need some sleep .
honey , what you need
is to start being honest with me ...
and with yourself .
okay . this-- this may be a bad idea ,
but ... we should get one of the queen
sitting on your lap .
no . no , we &apos;re done here .
sean , he &apos;s doing his job . he &apos;s not trying to torture us .
could &apos;ve fooled me .
i could photoshop pants on you .
i said we &apos;re done .
are you talking to him or me ?
hanna , don &apos;t push it , okay ?
you weren &apos;t the one standing alone last night
looking like a jackass because your date bailed on you .
i &apos;m sorry i deserted you .
my friend cracked her head open .
this was way before emily !
what are you doing ?
we need candid shots , too .
you put that in your yearbook , bro ,
you &apos;ll be pulling that camera out of your
sean , stop !
don t jump on him &apos; cause you &apos;re mad at me .
i &apos;m not mad . i &apos;m out of here .
did you get what you needed ?
can i interrupt ?
how was the game ?
well , they lost ,
but your brother tore up the field .
did mom make it ?
uh , no . no , she didn &apos;t ,
but ... we missed her , though .
mm , do i have to tell her that ,
or can you give her that message yourself ?
listen , aria , nobody wanted it to come to this , okay ?
your mom and i have been together since we were kids .
you weren &apos;t kids . you were in college .
no , we were kids .
right . neither one of us had ever been 50 miles away from home .
we &apos;d never ...
are you moving out ?
just tell me now ,
&apos;cause i don &apos;t wanna find out you &apos;re gone
while i &apos;m setting the table for dinner .
i would never do that to you ...
or your brother ,
but your mom thinks that it &apos;s best
that we spend some time apart ,
so i have agreed to
what ?
you have agreed to move in with meredith ?
no . no , god , no .
aria , meredith is not the issue here .
meredith is just a woman that i work with .
that &apos;s it . period .
do you still love mom ?
i do .
and i &apos;m leaving because--
because it &apos;s ... easier to walk away
than to fight for what you really want .
you &apos;re young , sweetheart .
there are a lot of things going on here
that are just outside of your reach .
yeah . well ...
this isn &apos;t one of them .
hanna . what ... what is wrong with you .
slow ... slow down .
hanna , spencer &apos;s right .
you can &apos;t burn the file out here .
look , this is a terrible idea .
just stay here .
fine !
hanna , hanna !
hanna , wait !
why am i staying here ?
can we at least talk about this ?
no ! i don &apos;t want this in my house .
i don &apos;t want it in my locker .
i will mail it to the police .
no , it &apos;s not gonna happen .
i &apos;m not having this traced back to me .
how are they gonna trace it back to you ?
i &apos;m the one licking the envelope !
guys !
i &apos;m the one who works in that building .
i &apos;m also the one who always gets caught .
hanna , spencer &apos;s right .
burning the folder out here is a bad idea ,
if the police could use it to build a case against toby .
he had a motive to kill alison !
and they can also prove
that i broke into his shrink &apos;s office .
look , i really can &apos;t afford to take
any more field trips to the precinct .
i &apos;m pretty sure after three strikes ,
you &apos;re assigned to the prison laundry room .
hanna , what strikes ?
you were just trying to save your friend .
look , i have already gotten busted
for stealing sunglasses and my boyfriend &apos;s car .
wait , you stole sunglasses ? from who ?
not from a person , from a store .
god , i have some class .
wait , are you talking about those ...
the gucci ones with the gold
focus !
okay , hanna , this is not about petty theft .
toby could be the killer .
we can &apos;t keep making these same mistakes over and over again .
we ?
yes , we !
okay ? we are all in this together .
we are all being stalked by &quot; a , &quot;
and if he &apos;s run off--
we don &apos;t know that he &apos;s &quot; a. &quot;
please !
have you gotten one single text since last night ?
okay , the devil has a name , and it &apos;s toby .
why are you being so pig @-@ headed ? !
why ? because i don &apos;t have a big , fat safety net to catch me .
not all of us have a daddy
who can write a check to make the boogeyman go away .
what are you talking about ?
spencer , you get caught stealing an essay ,
and your parents let you take a picture for the newspaper .
i get caught stealing an accessory ,
and i have to lug around medical waste .
there . it &apos;s done , okay ?
we never saw it , and we don &apos;t even know it exists .
can we leave now , please ?
hey , are you taking something for the pain ?
yeah , but nothing that dulls my mother .
she &apos;s got a zillion questions ,
and they &apos;re getting harder to dodge .
i can &apos;t believe jenna was in your house .
you didn &apos;t eat that cookie , did you ?
no .
it &apos;s okay . it &apos;s not from &quot; a. &quot;
i think we can finally stop flinching
every time our phones ring .
hey , it &apos;s from alex .
what &apos;s wrong ?
alex just blew off our do @-@ over date .
says he has to work .
well , that sounds legit .
it &apos;s not . club is closed on mondays .
hi .
hi .
i was looking for mr. fitz .
he &apos;s not in . i &apos;m his sub , miss shepard .
oh , is he sick ?
i don &apos;t know . is there something i can help you with ?
no ... no thanks
do you know if mr. fitz will be back tomorrow ?
i don &apos;t .
emily .
i know you &apos;re there .
i &apos;m kind of in a rush .
do you have it ?
i @-@ i don &apos;t , and no one else does , either .
listen , you do not have to worry about it anymore , okay ?
it &apos;s gone ... for good .
no one will ever know .
what ? what are you talking about ?
just what i said .
it &apos;s gone .
i hope you &apos;re not lying to me .
okey .
i got a message you wanted to see me .
from the universe ?
from a post @-@ it .
yeah , i @-@ i just wanted to get your approval
on the homecoming page for the yearbook .
i think i like ... that one the best .
really ? looks like sean ate a bad burrito .
yeah ... but ...
i could photoshop some magic , you know ,
find a smile somewhere .
use that one . it is what it is .
at least it &apos;s real .
damn , i thought i &apos;d look happier .
spencer ?
you are here .
you thought i was lying ?
no !
maybe ?
yes .
there &apos;s some big breakfast thing here tomorrow .
they told me i &apos;d get time and a half .
why are you looking at me like that ?
like what ?
like i &apos;d rather be making fruit kebabs
than spending time with you .
i guess i &apos;m just trying to figure this out .
so , are we ... still on for our do @-@ over date ?
you out of here , boss ?
hell , yes .
who &apos;s this ?
uh , just a friend helping out .
is that a problem ?
only if she &apos;s making melon balls without a hairnet .
suit her up .
if you need anything , don &apos;t call me .
i &apos;ll be laying in a puddle of my own waste .
you can stop now . he &apos;s gone .
well , is anyone else coming through ?
if they do , we &apos;ll hide you in the meat locker .
why ? think i canut handle stabbing kiwi
and cantaloupe ?
what are you doing ?
cutting your workload in half .
wow . if your parents could see
their little girl right now .
my parents stay on the other side of those doors , remember ?
come on , move your melon balls . you &apos;re slowing me down .
aria , wait up .
i &apos;ve been looking for you all day . did you-- ?
get the flowers ? yeah . don &apos;t ever do that again .
oh , are you allergic ?
i &apos;m one of hanna &apos;s best friends , sean ...
the person you should be sending flowers to .
i was just saying thanks for--
no , you were saying &quot; screw you , hanna . &quot;
okay , maybe i was ,
but can you blame me ?
she makes a big deal about going together ,
then bails .
stop !
hanna loves you , and you know it .
she hasn &apos;t talked about any other guy since the seventh grade ,
and believe me , it &apos;s boring how much she loves you .
why would you want to hurt her ?
what did you say to me ?
you heard me .
mike !
mike ! stop !
stop !
what is going on with you ?
leave me alone .
hey , what are you doing , man ? that &apos;s your sister .
let him go , sean . mike !
just , go to hell !
he &apos;s beating him ? that &apos;s insane . it &apos;s a cat .
wait , wait , wait till you see his backhand .
who posts this crap ?
people who have more free time than i do ...
which is hard to imagine .
do you want to see a turkey on a snowboard ?
sorry .
for what ?
i didn &apos;t mean to , like , you know ,
invade your personal ... skin .
it &apos;s okay . the leprosy cleared up .
are you okay ?
yeah . it &apos;s just ...
to be honest , i used to be so afraid of you .
of me ?
well , not you specifically ,
just your whole ... posse .
you know , alison &apos;s ... coven .
we weren &apos;t witches .
well , maybe you used your powers for good ,
but ...
alison was just straight up evil .
she called me hermie the hermaphrodite
for three years
just because she didn &apos;t like my glasses .
well , your shoes weren &apos;t that great , either .
come on , lighten up .
alison had names for everybody .
say hello to hefty hanna .
she called you that ?
why were you friends with this person ?
i mean , she had snakes coming out of her head .
yeah , well , she had another side to her , too .
when she wanted to ,
she could make someone feel really special .
wow . that &apos;s exactly not how she made me feel .
is &quot; snowboarding turkey &quot; hyphenated ?
what shelf are they on ?
check the bottom one under the sponges .
did you find them ?
god , no , don &apos;t look at that .
don &apos;t . w @-@ what is this ?
it &apos;s-- it &apos;s-- it &apos;s nothing .
it &apos;s stupid .
it &apos;s a picture of me with horns .
who did this ?
not me . it &apos;s the bitch board ,
something the staff does to blow off steam .
when a club member &apos;s rude to one of us ,
we keep a running tab .
and i made the cut ?
spencer , i &apos;ve never seen your picture
there before , i swear .
so this is how everyone who works here sees me .
where are you going ? spencer .
your sister took one look at me at homecoming
and thought i was there to park her car .
people act like this .
it doesn &apos;t matter if you &apos;re queen bees or worker bees .
hey . i know you don &apos;t want to talk to me ,
but could you at least listen to me for a sec ?
i wanted to give you a heads @-@ up .
that picture of you and me kissing ?
it &apos;s probably gonna be seen by a lot of people .
i won &apos;t lose sleep .
that &apos;s you , not me .
i &apos;m not gonna lose any more sleep , either .
i miss you ... and ...
and ?
and i want to try to make this work .
wow . when did this happen ?
the last time i saw you
you were slow @-@ dancing with toby at homecoming .
maya ...
can we just talk about you and me ?
how do i know you won &apos;t flake on me again ?
because i &apos;m trying this new thing
called being honest with myself .
how am i doing so far ?
decent .
ella . ella . ella , slow down .
ella , listen .
do you want to go somewhere
and figure out how we &apos;re gonna deal with this ?
deal with what ?
mike has never picked a fight before in his life .
well , i guess there &apos;s a first time for everything .
did you know that aria had been skipping her classes ?
did i know ?
as in , am i not keeping close enough tabs on our children ?
no , i &apos;m not .
or maybe i &apos;m just too trusting .
no , i am not being critical , okay ?
i m just saying that i think that we should be
putting the focus on them right now , not us .
we made a decision .
yeah , and that was before our kids
started spinning out of control .
okay , look , i &apos;m not moving out now .
they need us .
you don &apos;t get to play mr. moral
when you &apos;re the one who threw this family into chaos .
they &apos;ll get through this .
they &apos;re angry and confused
because we &apos;re angry and confused .
the sooner we sort this out ,
the sooner they will feel like they can rely on us again .
well , they can rely on us .
maybe . someday .
but it &apos;s not gonna help them to pretend
like everything is fine between us ,
because it &apos;s not .
you &apos;re not my child , you &apos;re not my roommate ,
and you can &apos;t sleep on a couch in the den
like some drunk uncle .
well , i don &apos;t want to leave .
well , i don &apos;t want you to stay .
ezra ?
ezra ?
ezra ?
this is ezra . sorry i &apos;m not here .
you know what to do .
hi , ezra ,
this is carol fineman from harrison country day .
i just wanted to confirm your interview for tomorrow ,
and please , don &apos;t forget to bring your new york certification .
again , we &apos;re really looking forward to meeting you .
what are you doing here ?
i copied down your reading assignment .
it &apos;s in my bag .
you brought me my homework ?
yeah .
heard you weren &apos;t in english today .
sub . just wasn &apos;t feeling it .
so , you &apos;re not mad at me ?
what , for ditching english ?
for ditching you at homecoming .
nah . i &apos;m over it .
we &apos;re not the first king and queen to have a fight ,
hanna banana .
what are you working on ? biology ?
no. no , no , no , you have to watch this .
you &apos;ll love it .
no , keep watching the turkey .
there &apos;s a half @-@ pipe coming up .
that is so not real .
it &apos;s just dumb .
why don &apos;t you put some music on ?
sure .
could you put it a little lower ?
thanks .
you gonna eat all that yourself ?
i always make enough for two .
mike ?
mike !
what ?
no , not &quot; what . &quot; talk to me .
do you know what &apos;s going on ?
you say good @-@ bye ?
maybe they know what they &apos;re doing .
maybe ...
