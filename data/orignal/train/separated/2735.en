Nobody ever went broke underestimating the taste of the American public.
The ancient Egyptians
postulated seven souls.
The top soul and the first to leave at the moment of death
is Ren: the Secret Name.
This corresponds to my Director.
He directs the film of your life
from conception
to death.
"The Secret Name" is the title of your film.
When you die, that's where Ren came in.
Second soul and second one
off the sinking ship is Sekem:
Energy, Power, Light.
The Director gives the orders,
Sekem presses the right buttons.
Number three is Khu: the Guardian Angel.
He, she or it is third man out.
Number four is Ba: the Heart--
often treacherous.
Number five is Ka: the Double.
The Ka, which usually reaches adolescence
at the time of bodily death,
is the only reliable guide through the Land of the Dead.
Who's gonna live here?
A family.
I'll have it finished by October.
I'm worried, Ade.
Everybody's worried.
No. I am worried all the time.
Number six is Khaibit:
the Shadow, Memory,
your whole past conditioning
from this and other lives.
Number seven is Sekhu:
the Remains.
I'm halfway to China. There's nothing here.
40, 000 I had--
my share of the Bohack's haul from the '70s.
Did you wrap it right? It gets moldy-- it could've disintegrated.
Wrap what?
The money.
He knows I need that money for my fucking retrial!
Who?
You know who.
No, I don't know who. That's why I asked you.
Malanga.
Will you stop with that?
Pussy Malanga's dead six years now.
I should dig him up already!
Moles.
They chewing through your sprinklers too?
40, 000 I had--
my share of the Bohack's haul from the '70s.
We'll look later. You're gonna be late for your doctor's. Come on. Hello?
Let me ask you something: ls your time more valuable than mine?
Where's the baby?
Sorry, Ton'. The car seat, the other stuff--
packin' it in there takes forever.
You probably remember that.
No, I don't. I didn't do that crap.
How are you feeling, Uncle Jun', huh?
He's late enough, Janice. Come on.
A hello to your niece, maybe?
Hi, sweetie. How are you?
Help him get ready, will you?
Yeah. - Come on, Jun'.
So? How's he doing?
He's Knucklehead Smith, that's how he's doing.
He's paranoid. He doesn't remember whether he ate or not.
The man is not competent, Tony.
Not again, come on! - He has the money for assisted living.
He's got legal bills up the ass.
He can sell this museum and move to Green Grove.
Fuck assisted living, okay?
Remember what they did to Ma?
She was thriving there, Tony.
He stays where he is, Janice.
He's our uncle. It's the least we can do.
So the split, your friend in Jersey
says it should be the same as the old business we do over there.
That's public works, this isn't.
I'll hold the line.
Don't turn it into World War lll.
So day to day, how are you getting along with Tony?
You asked me to bury the hatchet, John.
I'm doing it out of respect to you.
Am I still grieving over my brother Bill?
It'll never go away.
I appreciate it, Phil.
With me in here--
I hear you, John.
Your bride--
she's a rock for you, kid.
Her brother's fitting me for contacts.
When the trial starts,
I don't wanna be reading documents in the courtroom with glasses.
It looks weak. Yes?
Hey, Ton'.
Hey.
My sports book down in Roseville,
Bacala's still making things unpleasant.
God damn it.
Listen, Tony,
I got you something.
For you, Carm, the kids-- David Yurman watches.
18-karat gold, diamond center.
Why do I get the feelin' there's a jeweler somewhere
filin' an insurance claim today?
Actually, that ain't what it is.
My Aunt Edie died.
No?
That one that moved to California back in the '60s?
She was a great lady, the only person in my life who ever made me feel special.
What are you gonna do?
Anyway, the silver cloud is she did pretty well.
She was married to Victor Borge's agent.
She left me an inheritance, Ton'.
Just over two mil. - Whoa. - Yeah.
Well, congratulations.
Make sure you invest it.
Well, you know, that's kind of what I wanted to talk to you about.
Deanne and me and the kids, you know how much we love Florida, right?
What, do you wanna put some money on the street down there?
I was thinking about buying a place in Fort Myers.
Retiring there, actually.
Retiring?
What, are you a hockey player?
I'm gonna be 50 in three years, Ton'.
My dad died at 52.
You took an oath, Gene. There's no retirin' from this.
Well, I thought about that, and there was Joe Bananas.
Come on, huh?
What about your sports book, your other responsibilities?
What am I supposed to do about those?
Benny? We know Bobby wants it.
It's just-- we go back a long way, Ton'.
Yeah, we do.
Fuckin' CYO Basketball, do you believe that?
It'd mean a lot to me and Deanne.
Well, let me think about it.
Ooh, look at this one with the pool.
Yeah, we could go swimming.
Guess who's blocking the driveway again.
Did you talk to Tony?
It looks good. He gave me a hug.
Did he like the watches?
Do I know my psychology?
The realtor called. She's e-mailing some pictures.
The one on River Road?
The split level-- the four-bedroom.
They lost the buyer?
Hey, there he is.
Where are you goin'?
Kevin's.
Who else is gonna be there?
Gene.
I don't know.
What's with this hostility all the time? You want a smack in the mouth?
I told you I'm not getting high anymore!
I believe you.
Stop fucking touching me. Watch your mouth in front of your sister!
I have a right to know who your friends are! Hey! Hey!
Spicy shrimp hand roll, that's Nori's favorite,
special yellowtail, toro scallion and oysters.
You tell me when you wanna stop.
Well, keep it comin'.
I don't know about you, but ever since we found this place,
I catch myself fantasizing about this.
Me too. Sometimes during sex.
So I had a nightmare the other night. Did I wake you up?
No.
Ade was in the house,
my spec house.
Was she gonna buy it?
We were just talking.
Speaking of which, did you call that guy, the inspector at the building department?
I will. I promise. - He's coming on Friday, Tony.
That could be my last chance to get
a reversal on the stop-work order.
All right, I'll call.
I wonder where she is.
Ade.
I told you, she probably met some guy.
And not call anyone for over a year?
What's this, this sauce on the shrimp?
Shiromi, tekka maki, salmon with tomato.
So I was over by Ginny's--
that situation is not going so well.
Johnny cooped up and awaiting trial,
plus now they're fighting an asset seizure.
They could lose everything-- the house, the condo at the shore.
You know Jimmy Petrille, the rat that gave up John?
He's like an uncle to him, his father's compare.
Why do you think I toss at night? Ain't just the apnea.
I noticed you haven't been taking your antidepressants.
And yet, the bonefish are back in season.
We should count our blessings, the kind of year I just had.
You're right. We're very lucky.
$40 for a piece of fish they just flew in first class.
I think we're more than lucky.
Great food in there. It's pretty good. You wanna keep this baggie or shall I?
Nah, you keep it for lunch.
Okay.
We're here.
Thanks for dinner, Hesh.
Grease is coming through the bag as usual.
Chinese food-- it's part of the tradition. What the-- Whoa! Whoa!
What the fuck is this?
Come on, come on! Hey, where are you goin'? Get out of the car!
Get out of here, get out of here!
Take a hike, Jimmy.
Open up, Eli!
Get out!
Open the fucking door!
Get out of here!
What do you want me to do?
I can't do anything!
Fucking Jew!
Open the fucking door! Holy shit, they're trying to burn us out!
Open the fucking door!
Get out, Hesh!
Leave me alone!
Jerry warned you, Eli!
Jerry fucking told you to stay out of Brooklyn!
What are you guys doin'? You're gonna kill this guy.
Fuck you, Grandpa!
I tell you, one of the best things about dropping the weight,
a whole new wardrobe. I keep this up,
I'm gonna need Clothing Anonymous.
You should have called your sponsor before you bought that jacket.
Look at this guy.
"Members Only"? How long have you been wearing that?
Cugino mio!
You look sharp. How do you feel?
Two miles I walk every mornin'.
You goin' to little Tommy's communion?
I gotta talk to Aunt Lenore. Say hello to Marie for me.
Hold on, let me get that number,
the custom cufflinks.
Oh yeah.
What'd that prick want?
Really something, isn't he, with that jerk-off face?
The eyebrows-- I fucking can't stand him.
I gotta tell you though, he surprised me.
He's acting boss,
takes care of John's business,
plus the wife while John's in jail.
No complaints.
He's real old school.
Gotta take my hat off.
Cocksucker wanted me killed?
What's past is past.
Leave it alone.
Things are going good now.
You and Phil settle that office park shit?
We said we'd revisit it.
Agent Harris, where've you been?
I got some new federale in my rear view for six months.
Actually, I've been in Pakistan.
Get the fuck out.
Seriously. I was transferred to terrorism.
This is my partner, Ron Goddard. Tony Soprano.
The terrorist squad, huh?
What, did you lose a little weight?
Uh...
You look good. Atkins, right?
I caught a parasite over there. Doctors don't know what it is.
What do they eat, tabbouleh?
Actually, that's why I'm here.
I've been dying for a Satriale's veal parm hero.
Fuck him. I hope that parasite eats his asshole out.
I kind of feel bad for the guy.
Shit, when did this happen?
Hold on. Ton' just come in.
It's Hesh.
Yeah. Here, honey. It's ice.
Tony. Thank you.
Hey. Beth, how're you doin'?
I've had better weeks.
Could you get me some coffee, sweetie?
Anyone else?
Hot water with lemon would be great.
My son-in-law and me, we're having dinner Sunday,
Chinese restaurant near Mill Basin,
we get jumped by three guys in a Lexus.
Chinks did this?
Are you trying to be fucking funny?
You want a smack in the mouth?
What? I was serious.
They're with your cousin Phil Leotardo.
I told you he was a prick!
We were just with him.
Let him talk.
I got some money on the street over there.
Apparently, it got back to Phil's guy
Gerry Torciano.
The Hairdo? He claims that he felt that Eli here
was some independent shy trying to poach his customers.
ls that a fucking catheter?
Massive internal bleeding,
half his fucking skin is sheared off his hips.
My daughter's besides herself.
You send somebody to Brooklyn, and you talk to Phil
about this mook, this--
Gerry Torciano.
Sorry I yelled at you, kid.
I'm installing gable joists in the rotunda.
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to agree with the original assessment.
Oh, for the love of Mike!
This is pine, sir-- utility grade.
I know what it is. I've been building houses for years.
Then you know that the code calls for Doug fir grade,
stamped for all floor joists, ceiling joists, lintels and rafters.
Get Pudgie Walsh on the horn. He'll straighten this out.
Pudgie Walsh retired, sir.
I'm affirming the stop-work order.
Oh, come on!
ls there nothing else we can do?
For God's sake!
You can schedule a further appeal. But if I were you,
I'd think about starting over with the proper lumber.
God, 15 times I asked you!
Do you know what this does to my cost basis,
to start over with this?
It's bureaucratic bullshit!
ln my day, they'd turn a blind eye.
I hired you to do a job!
Hired? I'm not for hire.
You presented this like we were partners.
You don't listen to anybody, do you?
Oh!
To hell with this. No good deed goes unpunished.
Artie. Ho.
Menus.
ls that Phil?
My wife.
What's it take to get that guy to return a phone call?
I want this Hesh thing settled.
Gentlemen,
start your engines.
Jesus Christ, Artie, I can recite that menu in my sleep.
Where did he get this bread, the bread museum?
The antipaste?
Fuckin' Phil. Now I gotta go see the optometrist
to get a message to John about this.
Go through Ginny's brother?
He's a stunad of the first magnitude.
I need a back channel to John, obviously.
What the fuck is it?
I can't catch a fucking break!
This is Tony Soprano
talking about the Angelo Giacolone murder.
The sound quality is not good,
but I can back it up in court.
He said--
You all right, Ton'?
Yeah. That formaldehyde smell...
I knew this guy once, Vietnam vet.
He drank formaldehyde over there just to get high.
It's the alcohol.
Does he have to be here, your fucking AA sponsor?
It ain't just that he helps me with the disease, T.
This guy is great at forging documents.
He was a good kid, Raymond.
The best.
At least he went fast. Not like Dick Barone, poor fuck.
Dick Barone died?
Lou Gehrig's disease.
Did you ever think what a coincidence it is
that Lou Gehrig died of Lou Gehrig's disease?
You gonna make that same stupid joke every time that comes up?
Sorry.
Everything's so fucking morbid.
There's a man lying dead over there.
I'm gonna go smoke.
Hey, Tony.
Hey.
I don't know what I was thinking.
For you. Your taste.
The inheritance.
I didn't want to say nothing,
with your aunt and all, but this is thoughtful.
So that thing we spoke about...
Still mulling it.
Yeah, whatever. Sure.
All right. All right.
Look at this guy. Not a day over 76.
Fucking ballbreaker.
How are you, Rusty?
ls Phil Leotardo here? 'Cause I won't stay
in the same room with that man. - I haven't seen him.
So you hear about that guy in Westchester?
Fucking captain,
doing his own radio broadcast the last three years.
W. R.A. T.
Jesus Christ, another one now?
No wonder the papers are calling this "The Year of the Rat. "
Standup guys like that,
they're a dying breed.
Amen to that.
What can you do?
Anyway, let me go pay my respects.
All right, Rusty.
You okay?
I gotta get out of here.
He's thinking about it. What do you want me to tell you?
How many years have we dreamt about this, to get out of this shit?
Every time someone we know gets arrested--
I know. Will you stop?
I'm worried, Gene. We've already made the offer.
I'm doing everything I can.
Why are you fighting?
We're not fighting, sweetie. We're talking.
How come you're not in bed, hmm?
I don't know.
All I'm saying is, he has to see this is a huge opportunity for us.
Give the man time to process.
Oh my God, this eel is delicious.
Okay, Spanish mackerel now.
Can I get another sake, hon'?
Listen, I got some stuff I gotta take care of.
You okay to drive yourself home?
I don't have my car, Tony.
Oh, yeah. So take this one.
Hey, Mrs. S.
What is this?
Oh my God.
ls this the new Porsche?
Cayenne Turbo. I got the 4. 5-liter V-8.
Wasn't sure about the color, so I took a shot.
Tony, I love it. It's gorgeous!
I still wish you'd talked to that guy at the building department,
but oh my God! What a car!
Ho, Joe College, where's your mother?
She went to the outlet stores with Aunt Ro.
ls that the jacket we got you for Christmas?
I'm lending it to Matt.
Hey, how was the interview for the internship?
Got moved to next week.
Would you mind keeping me in the loop, though, since it was
my lawyer that set it up, huh? - Okay.
Matt don't have his own clothes?
He's borrowing it for a party.
Oh, good. You'll never see it again.
You have such a low opinion of people.
Let me tell you something, A. J.
I don't care how close you are,
in the end, your friends are gonna let you down.
Family. They're the only ones you can depend on.
He was vital, my uncle, alive.
For all his faults, he was sharp in his day.
But now...
We stopped at a light yesterday,
and I see this nanny, black girl, pushing a baby carriage.
Coming the other way,
there's another one
with this old lady in a wheelchair
staring off into space. - The circle of life.
The circle jerk of life. Where's the dignity?
lf you're lucky, in the end you can let go of your pride,
let your loved ones care for you.
I'd rather they hold a pillow over my face.
I find it interesting you would say that.
You tried to smother your mother with a pillow.
What? - ln the hospital, after her stroke.
The fuck I did!
I grabbed a pillow, but it was...
just to keep my hands occupied.
Have you considered getting your uncle some live-in help?
We got a girl comes in days, she's from Trinidad.
Does he have the means for assisted living?
Did you just say to let your loved ones take care of you?
lf it's feasible.
Well, he's my uncle.
I don't think that's what we're talking about.
What are we talking about?
The fact that you still, after all this time,
cannot accept you had a mother who didn't love you.
ln pitying your uncle,
the man she conspired with,
you're turning the blame for what she did
back on yourself again, after all this time.
What was your mother like?
Did she ever let you down, hurt your feelings?
Of course she did. She was controlling
and manipulative at times.
She also never tried to kill me.
I pushed her over the edge.
By placing her in a lovely retirement community.
It's a nursing home!
It's less hurtful to believe that they were right
to try and destroy you than to accept the fact
that she didn't value you.
Hesh is a personal friend of mine,
and the kid is his son-in-law.
Now I know Phil's got a lot on his plate, but come on.
I'll talk to John. I was taking my sister there Saturday anyway.
How is Ginny? Carmela says she's got her hands full.
The kid has the weight of the world on her.
Ray-Bans.
Classic, affordable.
I just put those on special.
You got something a little more current?
Like those.
Armanis. Flexible acetate frames,
rimless lenses.
You know what? I left my wallet in the car.
I'll catch you next time.
Some people from the lRS came by.
They want to inventory the entire house.
Maybe I should sell the car,
at least get some liquidity out of it.
The Maserati?
Can't say I disagree.
That breaks my fucking heart.
Christopher Moltisanti came over to the house asking about it.
He'll pay cash, he said.
There's something else, John,
Phil related.
The Hairdo, he's in a beef with the Jew.
What? God damn it, what?
The Jew's son-in-law. It got physical.
Your friend from Jersey got involved, but he can't get Phil to focus.
Do I not have enough on my fucking mind?
The guy from Jersey asked me to tell you.
Well, then call Phil and have him fucking handle it!
Don't yell at my brother, John. He's trying to do right by us.
The pictures from Allegra's shower.
Noon he said, right?
Passive-aggressive bullshit.
I recognize that in people every time now.
There he is.
Ho, finally.
I was starting to grow mushrooms out my ass.
There's an image.
So Gerry filled me in on the way over.
This whole thing was a complete misunderstanding.
Yeah, this Eli kid, I had any idea he was with you,
I would have never... - He didn't tell you about Hesh?
I asked who he was. He high-handed me. I thought he was a civilian.
Still, to get dragged by a car?
For the record, though, the car thing was a hit-and-run.
So what do we do here?
What did we say?
25 sounds right.
He's bleeding internally. Pain, suffering--
So you tell me. 50?
Yeah, fair enough.
Could we segue now into something more pressing?
The floor is yours, Senator.
I spoke to John. The split on the office park is way out of whack.
Same thing as the Esplanade.
Apples and bowling balls, Tony. With fuel costs now--
Like you're not passing that on to the drivers?
65-35. All right.
Why you always cave for this prick?
I'm not caving. It's a strategy.
Johnny's in jail. You keep him happy,
he'll keep a lid on Phil.
Tony B, Phil's kid brother,
the bad taste that left with Phil--
there are 200 soldiers in his family.
I'm not scared of them.
Tony left? - Yeah.
I stopped by Stewart's. I got a whole lunch set up.
Did Tony mention anything to you about what we talked about?
About you moving to Florida?
Did he say if he's leaning one way or the other?
Listen, there's something I need you to do.
I got a call from Fritzie up in Boston.
There's a guy named Teddy Spirodakis, owes some money.
You want me to collect?
That ship sailed. Final notice time.
Really?
You got a problem with that?
No. I just gotta run it by Vito. He's my captain.
Believe me, Vito will be down with it.
So this comes from Tony?
It's coming from me. I'm not a fucking captain?
All right, okay?
How soon?
ASAP.
Like right away.
I'll call with the details. Get it done.
I'll put in a good word to T. about the Florida thing.
The rear deck, didn't they say that would be refinished?
That's the old photo. It's been completely redone.
The wiring in the pool house? Tell them they can knock
two grand off the price or they can sell to someone else.
Listen, you're responding to their counter.
You should ask for whatever you want.
Okay, we'll call you tomorrow.
All right then, good night.
What do you think?
That if we lose this house, I'm gonna die.
Ton', what do you want to do for dinner?
I'll be right down!
Well...
Hey.
Your new insurance card.
Oh, good.
Any thoughts on dinner?
Whatever you like.
I know this is insane, but I can't stop thinking about Nori's.
I was just there.
Today? With who?
Nobody.
You went there without me?
Yeah, I was hungry.
What?
Nothing.
Come on, what?
I don't know,
I just thought that was our special place.
Well, it is. Well?
I went there alone, Carm.
I know that. You said.
It just felt nice to have something special, for us.
No kids around, without my parents...
We can go if you want. No, no, don't be silly.
Are you sure?
How's the car?
Teddy, right? Yeah. Hey!
Carmela.
Ginny, hi.
I tried calling, but I kept getting the machine.
ls everything all right? Truth is,
sometimes I don't answer the phone. Goddamn creditors.
I was in the neighborhood. I thought I might kidnap you for a spa date.
Well, that's a nice surprise.
I thought maybe we'd drive up there, maybe stop at Occitane.
ls that new?
Oh, the car? Yes, yes.
Porsche Cayenne, like the pepper.
It's beautiful, Carm.
Five minutes
at no incline. Then I switch to full uphill for my cardio.
I was telling Tony he should come with me.
Do him good.
It ain't just aesthetics, either.
God forbid he ever has a heart attack. Yeah.
Vito, you're in the handicapped spot.
That fucking guy is here again?
The man's a former judge.
Hey, listen to this.
"lf your nose runs and your feet smell--
you're built upside down. " Funny.
Hey, by the way, your Florida thing...
Tony asked me to speak to you...
that's a no-go.
What?
Can't be accommodated.
You're part of the team.
But I just did that thing.
That's not my department.
Well, can I talk to Tony at least?
I wouldn't bother him. He's out on the new boat.
Does he think I'm gonna talk about shit up here,
with what I've done, what I just did?
It's not so silly when you think about it.
I'm a top earner now.
It's not out of the realm of possibility
that I could be the boss of this family one day.
I mean, God forbid Tony ever gets...
cancer, coronary, something like that.
Yeah.
Hey, big brother.
Listen, I know I was supposed to sit with Uncle Jun' tonight,
but Tom just called from location.
Apparently, some smoke effect went awry
and he inhaled noxious chemicals.
Well, go. Go.
The thing is, Uncle Jun' doesn't want me to.
He's exceptionally agitated today and he's been nauseous.
Well, did you call Janice? I mean, her or Bobby should go.
I'm all the way out here on a boat.
They can't do it.
What do you mean can't?
I don't know.
She didn't elaborate. It didn't seem like she wanted to.
Aw, God damn it!
I'm sorry, Tony.
All right, all right, all right.
Mother--
I swear to God, I'm throwing all this shit right in the garbage!
It's my hobby, Janice. Why do you gotta belittle it?
Will you just get ready please?
You go. I gotta work.
You can do your collections tomorrow!
I'm on a schedule! It don't work that way.
This is why you can't watch Uncle Jun'?
I told you last week, we have Nica's preschool meeting.
She's 15 months old. - No one was more competitive
than your wife when it came to this stuff with A. J.
A lot of good it did.
This child-- constantly wanting the breast.
He doesn't want to be alone. He says he doesn't feel good.
The school, they need to meet both parents if it's an intact family.
So call the girl, the nurse.
Miss Trinidad? Right. Every time I call,
a different person answers.
I'll go, Ton'. I'm on it.
Fuck it! You wanna get something done, you gotta do it yourself.
You were the one
who was opposed to assisted living.
You and I are gonna talk.
You didn't have to wear your fucking hat.
Shit.
So how about you? Are you dating?
With my hours at the body shop?
Ladies.
Dessert was on me.
Thank you, Artie.
It's nice to see you two patch things up.
So silly.
I'm not even sure what happened.
Me and Tony didn't speak for months. You pick up right where you left off.
Did Charmaine tell you? We're getting back together.
No, she didn't mention it.
That's terrific!
We're both very happy.
Jesus, will you hear me out at least?
We buy here. Livingston, North Caldwell maybe.
Right near Tony. - Oh.
Better schools, new friends.
We got the money, baby. $2 million.
It's not the same, Gene.
It could be better.
The summers down there-- we were ignoring the negatives.
It's fucking brutal with the bugs.
Tony and Silvio, all they understand is appearances.
We'll buy a new car. It'll raise my profile.
You watch, I'll make captain.
I found this
under our son's bed.
Florida's any better? It's the drug capital of the world.
Look, for Tony to--
Tony, Tony! Why don't you kill him?
Put a bullet in his fucking head.
I can't do that.
What, you think I don't know that you've done it before?
He's the boss, Deanne.
The boss of what? He's a piece of shit!
ls our life that bad?
It's your money. Your aunt's money.
It has nothing to do with him.
There's this wonderful Jersey contemporary I want you to see with me.
It's cathedral ceilings.
You'll fall in love.
There's nothing I can say.
Colonel Dax,
you're a disappointment to me.
You have spoiled the keenness of your mind
by wallowing in sentimentality.
You really did want to save those men
and you were not angling for Mireau's command.
You're an idealist and I pity you as I would the village idiot.
We're fighting a war, Dax, a war that we've got to win.
Those men didn't fight, so they were shot.
Hello.
Who's that?
It's me.
What are you doing?
I lost my uppers.
Probably upstairs.
God fuck it all!
Relax, will ya? We'll find them.
The phone keeps ringing, and then they hang up.
It's probably salespeople.
I know who it is!
Pussy Malanga, I know.
We'll get J. Edgar Hoover right on it.
I'll tell you what, you go upstairs, you look for your teeth.
I'm gonna fix you something to eat, okay?
I had a banana in there.
All right, we'll find that too.
I got it. We buy a vacation place in Florida, a condo. It's not the same.
I make another run at Tony
six months, a year from now.
A year?
You can go ahead even.
What? And let me tell you, a year,
two years from now
everything could be different. Tony could be gone.
I, uh... - Go ahead.
His master's voice.
Yeah? Now?!
Gene, this is Agent Sanseverino.
Hello.
Where've you been, buddy? Haven't heard from you lately.
Busy, you know. My kid has some problems.
That's rough.
The thing is, Geno, you gotta keep in touch with me.
You have a chance to help in more important ways.
What do you mean? - We lost a major asset this month.
The point is--
Was Ray Curto a cooperator?
The way things are shaping up, you're a designated hitter.
Look, Ron,
we've talked about Florida, okay?
Gene, that's not gonna happen.
Here among your friends is where you're useful.
I told you, you tell your bosses, I'd come back for any trial.
Florida's just one of those things you gotta let go.
Okay. So, the Feast of St. Joe's, Tony gave some rulings on the unions.
Were any made guys from New York there?
10 minutes, Uncle Jun'.
Who's down there?
Artie Shaw. 10 minutes.
Don't go anywhere.
I'm not. I'm right here.
You got any wine? Malanga!
Well, here I am.
ls that a Porsche?
Had my eye on it for months. It's a gift from Tony.
I thought about a Boxster, but I don't know.
The 'Vette felt more like me.
You bought that yourself?
The accountant says I'm better off owning it outright.
Uncle Jun'!
Call 911!
Uncle Jun'!
911, where is the emergency?
