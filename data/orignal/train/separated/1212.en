I asked Noel to break into Hanna's house tonight.
That's who was in the kitchen. It was Noel.
Hey, how's your mom?
Freaked.
Guys, we needed to do that.
You saw Tanner cornering me at school.
She's trying to poke holes in our story.
Your story.
Can you take this?
Give each of the girls a copy.
They need to memorize it.
You recorded that?
Would you let me borrow one of those cameras?
The camera is for my sister.
She's connected to all of this.
Aria, if you don't want me to get married...
It has to do with you marrying Zack.
Was he inappropriate with you?
Maybe he was with Hanna.
Ali, where did that scar come from,
the one on your thigh?
Caleb, this can't go on.
I'm talking about Hanna.
She's getting wasted in the middle of the day.
I'm in Noel's car
and he has pictures of Alison.
He put them in the same envelope
as the tape he was listening to.
They caught him, the person
who broke in here last night.
Alison, is that the man who kidnapped you?
What's his name?
Cyrus Petrillo.
How did you find him?
Mrs. Marin's neighbor reported a man lurking
in her yard.
And he's admitted to everything?
His story matches Alison's.
The abduction, the blindfold, her escape.
I'm telling you the same thing
I told Ashley Marin and your daughter.
Not a word of this to anyone
until we get enough evidence to press charges.
We need to make sure that this man
is who he says he is.
Lieutenant...
where is she?
It must be him.
Is that him?
Is that the man who hurt you?
I don't know.
You said you don't know?
What was I supposed to say, Spencer?
How about "No"?
I was blindfolded, remember?
I'm sorry, do we seriously have to remind you
that you were never actually kidnapped?
There's a man being questioned by the police
right now for a crime that never happened.
Guys, this is "A."
I mean, you said he knew about the rock that hit you.
He knew where you were kept, what you ate,
what mattress you slept on.
It's the same story that you told the doctor.
And Holbrook, the night we got back from New York.
Well, it doesn't matter where "A" got it.
What matters is what "A" is planning to do now.
If "A" is behind this, that's exactly
who that guy is gonna run to when he panics.
What are you saying?
I'm saying, if I can make him think
that he's gonna go down for this,
we can follow him to "A" and finally win "A's" game.
Great.
We win the game, we find out who "A" is.
What happens when we lose?
Is it weird that we haven't gotten
an "A" message about this yet?
No, I don't need a creepy text to read the writing on the wall.
The second Ali says that this guy kidnapped her,
we're gonna figure out that Cyrus Petrillo's
a sheep farmer in Montana and couldn't possibly have done this.
And then the whole world's gonna know
that Ali's a big fat liar.
And us. Right now,
we're just as big and fat as she is.
Hey, guys, keep your voices down.
Yeah.
Thank God the cops are here so we don't have
to worry about being imaginary kidnapped.
Yeah, but once Tanner figures out
that the kidnapping story is a lie,
they're gonna figure out about New York and Shana real quick.
Ali's not an idiot.
She's not gonna walk right into an obvious "A" trap.
We don't know that anymore.
We all heard her in there. She's gone rogue.
Okay, well, someone needs to go back in there
and make sure that she doesn't ID this guy.
Right, well, Emily?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Spencer's the convincing one.
Yeah, but you're the hardest to disappoint.
It's about your eyes.
Awesome.
How's your mom doing?
She's heartbroken.
God, it's so awful.
I mean, first your dad cheats on her
and then this sleazebag boyfriend hits on me.
Hanna, she was there.
She doesn't need a play-by-play.
I'm just sorry. That's all.
Thanks.
You need a ride?
Yeah.
What is that?
It's Noel Kahn's insurance policy.
It's everything that Shana gave to Jenna that proves that Ali wasn't dead.
Ali knew it was out there,
she just didn't tell us about it.
Tanner would sure love to get her hands on this.
Yeah.
Ali talking to Shana when she's supposed to be dead.
You mean kidnapped.
Ali doesn't know you have this, right?
No, but I'm headed to my house right now to stash it.
In your house?
Is it safe?
I have a spot.
A spot?
That nobody else knows about.
Well, maybe you should tell us where this is.
You know, just in case anything were to happen to you.
Good-bye, Hanna.
Be careful please.
I will.
Aria's right.
If you identify this guy, it will be way too easy
for "A" to prove that you're lying.
We don't even know who this Cyrus person is
or where he came from.
I get it, Em.
Okay? I do.
But I can't just say that this guy is innocent.
Why not?
Ali, it's--
Oh. Emily, hi.
Uh, I just got back from the station and, Emily,
could I have a word with Ali?
Dad, I already told her.
Al, you were not supposed to do that.
Emily helped save my life.
She deserves to know what's going on.
The person you should be talking to is Tanner.
That man knew every detail.
How would he know that unless he did it?
He confessed already.
The police said this same man could have
killed your mom and Bethany Young.
We're all here to support you, Al.
Emily, all of your friends,
we all want the same thing...
to put this man away for a very long time.
Yeah.
We...
all want you safe.
Whatever you're afraid of, please, don't be.
This man is behind bars
and all we have to do is keep him there.
Yes, I know I just made the appointment,
but the situation has changed.
No, I don't need to reschedule,
because I don't need to book a banquet hall
for a party of one.
Mom?
Mom, you don't have to do that right now.
I just want to get it over with.
Well, Mike says that you haven't eaten all day.
It's pesto and mozzarella.
It's your favorite.
It was incredibly sweet of you to make this for me, honey,
but I just don't think I'm up to eating.
I'm sorry.
It's okay.
I should have seen this coming.
I was too old for him, I was too trusting.
Mom...
Mom, this has nothing to do with your age.
This isn't your fault.
There were signs, Aria,
and I just drove right past them.
Because I wanted to believe that it could work,
I wanted to believe that he could change.
You're the one that taught me that second chances exist.
Your bliss is still ahead of you.
Honey, when I said that, I was talking about Zack.
Okay.
Why don't you let me make the rest of these calls, okay?
The last thing you need to do is recount
your break-up to a bunch of strangers.
How the hell did "A" get somebody to confess?
I don't know.
What's Ali gonna do?
Whatever the hell she wants.
Don't you think you should find out what that is?
Nope.
Uh, I was eating that.
Hanna.
Hanna, what are you doing?
None of this stuff is good for you.
Soda, beer, soggy nachos?
It's poison, Caleb.
When was the last time we ate a vegetable
that wasn't battered and fried?
You know what? Enough trash talking my diet.
What is going on?
Nothing.
Just another day in the life of Alison DiLaurentis.
She's in the driver's seat of my life
and I'm supposed to watch her just steer me off a cliff?
I'm sick of it.
Okay, well then, toss her, not my fried zucchini.
You know, the other day Ms. Adinolfi
made an announcement about chorus auditions for a solo
and all the girls are freaking out.
Then I thought, wow, what's that like?
To lose sleep over some stupid chorus audition.
I mean, is that what normal people do?
They go to football games and wave pompoms
and freak out over a chorus solo?
Normal people are not being hounded by "A."
Besides, you don't care about that stuff.
Well, maybe I should.
Look, I don't know what I'm gonna do about Alison,
but I am going to that stupid audition.
Hey, how'd it go with Ali?
Unclear.
Mr. D. kind of kicked me out.
Did you find a place for the...
thing you got from you-know-who?
You speaking in code now?
Seems like a good idea.
Roger Wilco.
We still need a more permanent solution,
but I've got a temporary one.
What are you up to?
Avoiding the brew as much as possible.
Zack went back to Austria, but the place is still tainted.
Have you ever tried Blue Light Cafe?
No.
Good. Well, don't.
Okay.
What's going on, Spencer?
It's gone.
What's gone?
The recording Ali gave me and the medical exam, it's gone.
Gone as in "stolen" or gone as in--
No, this isn't code, Emily. It's gone as in "It's not here."
Just give me a second, okay?
Spencer?
Spencer?
Need any help?
I thought you left already.
We forgot the grocery list.
Looking for something or just redecorating?
I just...
I dropped my pen.
What do you want, Melissa?
Mom wanted me to check, see if you'd like
anything special for dinner tonight.
Take it. I'll wait.
Emily, I'll have to call you back later.
He followed me into my yard
and then he hit me with that rock.
Next thing I knew I woke up blindfolded.
I can't sleep.
Even now.
I can still hear him breathing.
Something wrong?
Just tell mom we're out of peanut butter, okay?
I'm really glad that we're doing this.
Me, too. You good?
Yeah. Great.
Are we almost done?
Is that Spencer?
Maybe we should just go back the other way.
It's a loop, Hanna.
Hanna?
When your mom said you were out on a run,
I thought she was joking.
Well, seeing is believing, Spencer.
Caleb, can you just give us a second?
No.
No?
No, we're doing a loop.
Hanna, this is important!
Fine. Look, I just stayed up all night looking through
the surveillance footage of my backyard,
trying to figure out who took the recording of Ali--
Okay, whatever it is, I'm just not interested.
You don't even know what it is yet.
Look, I have to be at that audition in an hour.
I have to go.
What audition?
Hanna, are you seriously running away from me?
I'm faster than you, Hanna! I have a car.
Hey, just lay off, Spence.
What is going on?
You asked me to help Hanna.
That's what I'm doing.
Just watch the bushes.
Who is that?
Just watch.
She just gave him something, right?
Yeah.
That's not all.
Watch what she's saying.
Do it. Trust me.
Do it.
When was this?
It was three nights ago.
Less than 24 hours before Cyrus Petrillo confessed.
What, you think the guy in the video
in your backyard is Ali's fake kidnapper?
That Melissa stole the recording and gave it to him?
I mean, we already know she's working for Mona,
so why not "A," too?
'Cause it's gonna make my head explode.
That's why.
Oh, my God, do you think that Melissa sent that text?
Maybe.
I mean, she always liked chess.
Look, Aria, we cannot take anymore chances.
We have to cut the cord with Ali
before she drags us down with her.
What are you saying?
I'm saying we use what we got from Noel.
The pictures, the conversations with Shana,
'cause they prove that Ali was alive
and decidedly un-kidnapped for the past 2 years.
Okay. And that helps us how?
We go to Tanner and we tell her the truth,
that we thought that Ali was dead
up until Ravenswood.
The only thing that we know about the past 2 years
is whatever Ali told us, that she lied to us,
just like she lied to them.
Okay. But what about New York?
We can't just come half clean.
I know.
But we tell her what happened there, too,
that it was self-defense and you were protecting us.
That's the truth.
But the truth doesn't amount to much
when it comes from a bunch of liars.
Spencer, the whole reason I'm freaking out
about this Cyrus thing
is that it could lead Tanner to the theater.
And now you want to beat "A" to the punch?
Exactly.
Because it's better if they find out from us.
So what are you saying,
that Alison might say this guy's guilty?
Yeah.
She thinks that he's gonna lead her to "A,"
when really "A"'s gonna make this
whole confession lead Tanner back to us.
But she wouldn't do that.
She's crazy, but she's not stupid.
Yeah, I thought so, too.
But a whole day has passed and this guy,
he's still sitting in jail.
Everything's gone, right?
The book, the research, the photos of Ali, all of it?
Because if Tanner comes here--
Aria, you were the one that sent Spencer
over to help me move everything.
Remember?
She's very thorough. You and I both know that.
Where is she?
Who? Spencer?
No. Alison.
Why?
Because I want to talk to her, that's why.
No. No, you're not.
You just got your stitches out, Ezra.
You're about to take a bike ride
for the first time in God knows how long.
You just got the all-clear from your doctor.
You're okay again. You're really okay, and--
No, I-- I'm not gonna allow you to jump back on
Ali's crazy train.
Not with Tanner circling
and "A" watching our every move.
No.
Aria--
No. Promise me you won't speak to her.
Please.
I like knowing that you're safe.
Okay.
Okay, I promise.
How long till your dad gets back?
About an hour.
He's meeting with a social worker.
Why?
He thinks I'm afraid of retribution.
He thinks that's the reason
why you don't want to ID this guy?
Look, I know your dad is putting pressure on you.
Okay? I--
I know he's convinced
that this is the guy who took you
and killed your mom and Bethany Young.
And I'm sure Tanner would love to wrap up
all three nightmares with a neat little bow
and you...
What about me?
You love that, for once, everyone seems to believe you.
That's not what this is about.
Good.
'Cause, I swear, if you let some stranger go to jail
because you're trying to cover your ass--
He's not a stranger, Emily.
Who? Cyrus?
What do you mean "He's not a stranger"?
Do you know him?
I don't know how "A" found him...
but...
he's the one who gave me this.
You were living with this person?
In an abandoned basement?
Did he know who you were?
Just that I was on the run.
He said he could tell that I was different.
Special.
What happened, Ali?
He didn't want me.
He just wanted my stuff...
my money.
And the way he looked at me...
like I was nothing to him.
Worse than nothing.
I'm sorry, Ali.
But "A" is using this creep to trap you,
to trap all of us.
"A" wants you to identify him.
You have to let him go.
You know that, right?
I know.
Okay! Mona, we get it.
You can freaking sing.
Okay.
Next up, we have Jamie DeMayo,
Hanna Marin, Ronni High
and Mona Vanderwaal.
Come on in, girls.
Mona!
Mona!
You were supposed to meet me outside my house,
not in my room.
Your mom let me in on her way out.
She made me some snacks.
Carrot stick?
I don't want this in my house.
If it's not safe at your place, it's not safe at mine.
Is that "A" again?
No, it's Noel Kahn.
He wants his loot back.
Okay, don't answer.
No, I have to.
We might need him.
What if he has more pictures
or information that we can use?
Use for what?
To turn on our friend?
Aria filled me in on your great idea.
It's not gonna happen, Spencer.
What we should be doing is burning this stuff.
Emily...
Ali is not our friend right now.
She's a dangerous person who has no problem
gambling with our lives.
She's not dangerous, she's hurt.
I'm sorry, what?
She doesn't want me to tell you.
Oh, no, of course, she doesn't.
It's always the same with you two, isn't it?
Just trust me, okay?
She's not gonna ID this guy.
She's gonna wait out the 48 hours
and after that the cops have to let him go,
and it's all over.
And you believe her?
After all the lies she's told?
I do.
We're either all in this together or we're not.
Ali's not the problem, Spencer.
Melissa is.
She's the one that gave Cyrus
the recording of Ali's medical exam.
I did my part, I talked to Ali.
If you really want to help, talk to your sister.
Mona?
Mona, can you hear me?
What happened?
Where am I?
No, no. Lay down.
Mona, you fainted.
You were out for almost a minute.
Where's my bag?
It's over there.
Ms. Adinolfi is on the phone with your mom.
Give it to me.
I need my bag.
Your mom's on her way.
What can I get for you?
Juice?
Maybe some water?
How's your head?
Anything hurt or--
Hanna, my bag.
You are not in this alone.
A lot of people have supported you,
done whatever you've asked,
gone along with all your stories.
Is this a threat?
No.
Right now it's an observation.
Did Aria ask you to talk to me?
Because if one more person tells me what I should do,
I swear I'm gonna scream.
Can I help you?
If there's something you need to tell my daughter,
you can talk to me or with the police.
Oh, no.
I'm so sorry.
I was just saying hello.
You okay?
Was he bothering you?
It's fine, Dad.
We don't have much time.
Alison, they have to release him
after 48 hours.
Now, I know this is hard,
but we really have to go.
You know, I think I'm just gonna get a refill.
Two minutes.
Looks like you recovered quickly.
You followed me?
Yep.
Whose car is this?
Is this a rental?
You really go full out.
Hanna--
Mona, there was a mug shot
of Cyrus Petrillo in your bag.
So either you set this whole thing up
or you've been bluescarfing the inside scoop.
Snarfing, bluesnarfing.
And no, I didn't set this up.
I'm here to find out who did.
Great. Me, too.
What does this thing do?
Hanna, get out.
Look, Mona, we both know that Ali brings out
the "A" in you.
So whether you're behind this or not,
I don't trust you one bit.
And I'm not leaving here until I find answers,
either from you or that doohickey.
Fine.
What are you doing?
If you won't leave, I will.
Are you sure you want to do that?
Where are they going?
What do we do now?
We do nothing.
Mona, we have to find out where they're going.
We have to follow them.
Do something!
No need to follow.
I just got access to Tanner's phone.
170 to Control.
Transporting witness to 5th Street house
for possible identification.
18:54.
Take off your seatbelt, Hanna.
We're not here to follow her.
We're here to follow him.
What did you say to her?
That her actions have consequences.
What about yours?
Were you even listening when I asked you not to talk to her?
Yes, I was.
And you sought her out anyway?
I... I didn't...
Here, let me just--
No, I got it.
Okay.
I didn't seek her out.
I saw her, I made a split decision
and I walked over.
Right in the middle of town.
Right in front of her dad.
And what if Tanner saw you?
Once she figures out that you and Alison are connected,
it is over.
You get that, right?
I'm sorry, Aria. I really am.
I was just trying to help out
and the only way I knew how--
By lying to me.
By talking to Alison.
Yeah, the one thing I asked--
Because--
The one thing I asked you not to do.
Why are you this upset?
Find what you were looking for?
You were certainly in there for long enough.
I was missing my blue sweater.
You know that one with the buttons?
I thought maybe it ended up in the barn.
Any luck?
No, not really.
I saw your computer.
I know you're looking at flights.
London.
Zurich. Taiwan.
So are you planning a vacation
or are you running away?
How is that any of your business?
I don't know, Melissa. Is it?
I know you're helping Mona, okay?
And now...
Is somebody making you do something
that you don't want to do?
Are you trying to run away?
Is this what it's come to?
Searching each other's rooms,
looking for answers to questions
that we're too afraid to ask?
I only helped Mona
because I wanted you to see that
Ali hasn't changed.
She's as toxic as ever.
We both know Ali wasn't kidnapped.
But sooner or later, she is gonna get what she deserves.
And I do not want you standing too close
when that happens.
So all of this is just sisterly concern?
Is it really that hard to believe?
What did you do, Melissa?
And I'm asking you to your face this time.
I can't tell you.
Not yet.
You're my sister!
Does that mean nothing to you?
It means you should know that...
honesty does not come easy for this family.
Okay, well, we can improve upon our genetics, huh?
Let's at least try.
I'm trying, Spencer!
It is not safe for me here...
or for you.
Maybe you should come with me.
This is where he said he kept you.
The property has been abandoned for years.
Not a lot of neighbors around either.
Al, you okay?
Cyrus Petrillo may have confessed,
but we don't have the physical evidence
we need to charge him
and our 48-hour hold is running out.
I know this is difficult,
but since you can't identify your abductor,
I need you to try and remember this space.
Come on.
I want you to meet my friends.
This is crazy.
Hey, guys.
This is Cyrus.
My bag!
Hey, get off me!
You remember this place?
I can never forget it.
How long before they release him?
According to Tanner's emails,
it could be any minute.
He could go out the front or the back.
Well, I would say we should split up,
but I wouldn't trust you telling me what you saw.
Well, the feeling's mutual.
Why did you tell Miss Adinolfi
that you fainted because of a panic attack?
Because I did.
Since when do you have panic attacks?
Since when do you get sauced before third period?
Well, I'll say it if you won't.
Since Ali came back.
Why do you think I went on the offensive?
She scares me to death.
I just...
didn't want to face her alone.
Hey, Caleb.
Sorry, I haven't called you back.
The audition?
It went great.
But there were a lot of other girls there,
so I probably won't get it.
But I'm just about to sit down with my mom for dinner
so I'll call you after, okay?
Okay, bye.
Lying to your boyfriend again.
Nice.
Oh, please.
Like Mike Montgomery knows a single real thing about you.
170 to Control.
Witness has identified 5th Street house.
ETA to the courthouse, 8 minutes.
Do not release suspect in holding.
I repeat, do not release Cyrus Petrillo.
I'm the one confusing things, Em.
I can't trust Ezra.
I don't.
And people don't just change because you want them to.
Hey, can I call you back?
I heard that you went out.
What's in the bag?
My attempt to jumpstart my single life.
I may have gone a little overboard.
Would you wear this?
Yes.
Which is why you shouldn't.
I thought so.
So you're talking again...
to Ezra?
That was just Emily on the phone.
But, yeah,
we're--we're talking.
Honey, I went through two boxes of tissues yesterday
and bared my soul to you about thirteen times.
You can talk to me.
Please.
I thought he was gone, Mom.
Really gone.
The whole time he was in the hospital,
I was just making up this list
of the things that I'd tell him if I just got one more chance.
And now he's okay
and I'm so glad that he's okay.
But I'm just-- I'm stuck with that list still.
And there's all these thoughts and there's all these feelings
that are just bashing around in my head
every single time that I see him.
And I want to be able to trust him again.
Just start over.
But you're right, people don't change.
Aria, honey, that's not true.
People can change.
I know because I've changed.
You've changed.
Even your dad has changed.
Your dad was the one
who got me up off the couch this morning.
Okay, it was the ricotta pancakes.
I know it's a small thing,
but he used to be incapable of making anything
in a skillet without turning it black.
Mom, you don't have to try to make me feel better.
Aria, listen to me.
I don't know what exactly happened with Ezra,
but I do know that Zack
is not gonna write the book on relationships in this family.
Not if I have anything to say about it.
艾莉找出赛勒斯是谁了 需要见面
Is that him?
Em?
Ali, can I talk to you?
Dad, I'll be right in.
Okay.
You heard.
Yeah.
But I didn't understand.
You identified him?
Ali, I thought we were in this together.
We are.
No.
We're not.
Whatever "A" has planned
affects all of us, not just you.
I waited as long as I could.
Everyone was looking at me, being in that place.
You weren't there, Em.
When?
When wasn't I there?
When Hanna broke her leg because of "A"?
When I almost died in an elevator
because I was trying to find out who killed you?
Or when Spencer had to check into Radley
because of everything your disappearance put us through?
The past several years haven't been easy for any of us,
but what makes it okay is that we stick together.
We don't turn on each other.
I have a plan.
I'm sure you do.
The problem is you'll throw us all under a bus
just to pull it off.
I stuck up for you against Paige, against Spencer,
against everyone.
I wasted so much time on you.
Emily.
I'm gonna make it right.
I am.
I can still find out who "A" is.
Please.
I'm done, Ali.
I am so done with you.
If Ali identified the guy, then how did he get away?
Once the clock struck 8:10, he was a free man.
"A" must have had a getaway car out back.
By the time Tanner called in the ID, he was gone.
Gone or not, "A" could still use this against you.
Yeah, I know.
But Spencer has a plan.
A good one?
No.
It's awful.
Even for Spencer.
Look, I'm sorry, Caleb.
I shouldn't have lied to you.
I just...
After everything I said yesterday,
I didn't want to tell you that I was in a car
with Mona spying on Ali.
Hanna, we can't get control back
by avoiding what's going on.
If it makes you feel any better...
I didn't exactly have a kale salad for lunch.
No?
Try a bacon calzone.
Give me a call if you need anything, okay?
I will.
I love you.
"Sooner or later,
Ali's gonna get what she deserves."
That's what she said?
Yeah.
Melissa basically admitted
that "A" has something terrible in store for Ali and us.

We can go to Tanner.
We can tell her the truth about Ali.
God, no. I know.
You've mentioned that like 16 times already.
