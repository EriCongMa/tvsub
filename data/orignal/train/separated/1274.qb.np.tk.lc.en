back off , merton . back off .
shh ! quiet !
do you want the neighbors to complain again ?
it doesn &apos;t get any better than this , does it , merton ?
yes ! done !
every follow @-@ up report . what &apos;s my prize ?
two days off to hang with your boyfriend .
mm ! first days i &apos;ve taken in a year .
bpd owes me 116 .
that &apos;s nothing . they owe me 243 .
why are you two competing
over who takes the fewest vacation days ?
because we &apos;re studs .
so what do you and casey have planned ?
well , he &apos;s only on leave for 72 hours , so nothing .
jane .
he sent seven letters in the last five days .
he &apos;s bored .
he &apos;ll get a new prison pen pal eventually .
i &apos;m curious .
for all i know ,
paddy could be confessing to another crime .
oh , i &apos;m sure that &apos;s it .
they &apos;re releasing him .
they &apos;re what ?
they can &apos;t . he &apos;s awaiting trial
for the murder of cavanaugh &apos;s wife and baby son .
no , i @-@ i don &apos;t mean paddy .
his father -- ppatrick sr.
paddy &apos;s father &apos;s still alive ?
yeah , he &apos;s the first boston mob boss
to ever to go down for r.i.c.o.
he &apos;s been locked up for -- what ? -- 30 years .
31 .
what ? let me see this .
&quot; of all the people guilt @-@ tripping -- &quot;
he wants you to take in his father .
didn &apos;t patrick sr. threaten to kill hope
when he found out paddy got her pregnant ?
yes . he did .
and who was hope pregnant with ?
i can &apos;t really remem-- oh , yeah ! you , maura !
the parole is conditional .
they &apos;ll revoke it
if he doesn &apos;t have a place to live by tomorrow .
paddy says he won &apos;t last much longer in prison .
well , is it bad form to say , &quot; yay &quot; ?
he &apos;s on a waiting list for public housing .
it might just be a few days .
i could at least put him up in a hotel .
no , you can &apos;t .
he has to have a permanent address .
dr. isles .
rizzoli .
yes .
okay .
all right .
all right , we got it .
we got a floater in a hot tub .
first responders aren &apos;t sure
if it was an accidental drowning .
please , please don &apos;t let this
mess up my plans with casey , please !
you want me and korsak to take it ?
what the hell is that , frost ?
i put &quot; shot alert &quot; on my computer to track city shootings myself .
okay , here we go . moss hill gym and racquet club .
dispatch .
looks like we got a victim there . you take that .
jane and i will take the floater .
then who &apos;s helping me ?
martinez got you on anything ?
no . what do you need .
there &apos;s your help .
well , at least she was having a good time .
wine , weed , and cheese doodles .
oh , there was a boom box in there with her .
she was electrocuted .
i can &apos;t be certain of cause of death
until i dissect her lungs .
she seems to have a significant amount of adipose tissue .
and this sheen appears to be glycerol .
body fat and lotion .
that would slow down conductivity .
yeah , boom box was pushed into the hot tub .
we got ourselves a murder .
pink froth around her lips and nose .
you have a tell when your head &apos;s not in the game .
i don &apos;t know what you mean .
&quot; pink froth &quot; ?
not &quot; cytoplastics hematoma liquidity
at a cellular level &quot; ?
no .
you still ruminating over your messed @-@ up family ?
paddy doyle isn &apos;t my family .
but he is part of my genetic makeup ,
as is my grandfather , and i want to meet him .
oh , so now you &apos;re heidi ,
and you &apos;re gonna climb the alps with gramps and feed the goats ?
pink froth is a result of hemolysis
due to rupture of red blood cells
and the release of cytoplasm into surrounding fluid .
so she inhaled water .
you see anything that suggests she was held under ?
i see some bruising on her shoulders , yes .
that &apos;s the friend who found the body .
the victims rhonda clark .
she &apos;s a professor in the sociology department at b.c.u.
the ladies had a weekly date in the hot tub .
yeah , with mr. chardonnay and mrs. cannabis .
yeah , i sent officers to b.c.u. to get the husband .
he &apos;s a sociology professor , too .
okay .
hey , merton ! here , boy !
robert merton was a famous sociologist .
he developed the concept of unintended consequences .
can you make him stop ?
watch this . hey .
here , merton . here , boy .
good dog !
quiet !
nice try , dog whisperer .
can you put him back in the house ?
wait , korsak , did we get any complaints tonight
from the neighbors about a dog barking ?
i can ask . why ?
well , he &apos;s a barker .
if he &apos;s not barking his head off
when his master &apos;s getting murdered
then that means he knows the killer .
good thinking .
hey , frost , what do you got ?
sweet ride .
you never see this color . it &apos;s called &quot; beluga black . &quot;
i meant the victim .
oh , uh , sorry . sorry .
mark cabot , 37 .
he was the very wealthy head of annisquam investments .
the cabots are an old family -- boston brahmins .
he &apos;s a member of this club .
parks his expensive car by itself
in the &quot; platinum circle . &quot;
witnesses ?
none , and the security cameras
were in the process of being upgraded .
that &apos;s convenient . robbery ?
as his wallet and very nice watch are still here ,
so i don &apos;t think so .
we &apos;ll process the scene and wait for dr.isles.
i &apos;ll be there as soon as i can .
okay , frankie , you got to do the notifications .
me ?
he &apos;s married .
his wife and his sister worked with him .
i called the company . they &apos;re still at work .
it &apos;s an awful part of the job ,
but you got to get used to it , okay ?
you can do it .
okay .
merton is quite the barker .
we got a long list of complaints ,
but none tonight .
and the dog wasn &apos;t barking on the 911 call .
that &apos;s interesting .
nothing seems disturbed upstairs .
this must be the husband .
i wonder where he was tonight .
i told her so many times to be careful in the hot tub .
this is tragic .
just as she was about to get everything she wanted .
what was that ?
tenure .
we were that -- that lucky academic couple .
what do you mean , because you worked at the same university ?
that never happens , especially not with
a liberal @-@ arts subject like sociology .
it &apos;s so competitive .
did you have tenure ?
why ?
it must have been difficult
being married to someone who was about to have tenure before you .
she deserved it .
can you tell us where you were this evening ?
why ?
my wife drowned , didn &apos;t she ?
she was murdered .
where were you ?
just what the hell are you asking me ?
okay , i loved my wife , all right ?
we -- we were partners . we did everything together .
where were you ?
with my students .
okay , my office hours are from 5 : 00 to 9 : 00 p.m.
you can ask them .
you know what ? better yet , why don &apos;t you ask big brother ?
nsa isn &apos;t the only agency that &apos;s watching us .
i got a parking fob , i got a building pass .
this is my atm card .
you check my digital footprint if you don &apos;t believe me .
that &apos;s a good idea . i think i &apos;ll do that now .
the older one &apos;s the sister .
that &apos;s the wife .
god , how do i do this ?
you just got to do it .
maybe i &apos;ll stay in drug unit .
if i can look at dead bodies , you can do this .
can i help you ?
i &apos;m detective frank rizzoli , boston homicide .
i &apos;m sorry to have to tell you this , but ...
boston homicide ?
god , it &apos;s not ...
please , no . - jenny , it isn &apos;t -- it isn &apos;t mark .
i &apos;m afraid it is .
what ?
we found his body .
what ?
i &apos;m so very , very sorry .
oh , my god .
got it , jane . thanks .
that was my partner .
big brother just gave you the thumbs @-@ up .
she &apos;ll meet you downstairs with your card and keys .
i told you .
apologies for the tough questions .
look , all that matters now is that you find out
who did this to rhonda .
we think your dog might have known the killer .
how well would merton have to know someone
before he &apos;d stop barking ?
really well .
how many people did he know that well ?
a lot of people .
rhonda had office hours at home ,
so there were students there all the time , and faculty ,
and she had a lot of friends .
i &apos;ll call you if we have anything .
thank you .
excuse me .
excuse me .
hey , uh , the victim &apos;s wife and sister asked me
if they could have a sergeant with them
in the interview room .
did frankie screw up the notification ?
no , but they sensed how green he is .
we sure they &apos;re not suspects ?
positive . i checked their parking cards .
they never left the building &apos;s garage .
in their cars , anyway .
i checked the office &apos;s online server , too .
they were both logged in when he was gunned down .
okay .
come on . let &apos;s talk to them .
we need to ask both of you if mark had any enemies .
you &apos;ll find this out soon enough .
my brother was an acquired taste .
he was a really wonderful human being ...
if he liked you .
but he wouldn &apos;t win any popularity contests .
he headed up a leading arbitrage company .
you don &apos;t make friends buying companies to tear them apart .
competitors called him &quot; darth raider . &quot;
i mean , to his face .
he was really funny about it .
he &apos;d just ... smile .
i think i &apos;m hearing you say he had a long list of enemies .
it shouldn &apos;t matter what people thought of mark .
business acumen and arrogance shouldn &apos;t get you killed !
it shouldn &apos;t , but it might have .
we need a list of anyone you think might be responsible .
okay . we can do that .
we &apos;ll also need all former and current clients --
anyone that mark did business with .
yeah , leslie handles all that .
yeah , it &apos;s a family @-@ owned company .
i &apos;ll give you everything .
initial tox screen confirmed she had
a 0.01 blood alcohol level ,
and a high level of cannabis in her system .
oh , well , add electricity to that ,
and she wouldn &apos;t be hard to hold underwater .
oh , put him over here on the table .
is that the shooting victim ?
yes .
he was shot at close range .
the bullet &apos;s still lodged in the skull .
how did frankie do at the scene ?
good . very composed . but he had a good teacher .
oh , i need frost &apos;s magic fingers .
wait . okay , here we go .
rhonda and rick clark were both experts in
anomie , whatever that is .
the study of social instability --
environment has a significant effect on genetic expression .
one more reason to be thankful
that paddy doyle didn &apos;t raise you .
so , she was about to get tenure , and he wasn &apos;t .
well , that will put a strain on a marriage of academics .
sayre &apos;s law -- the politics of a university are so intense
because the stakes are so low .
seems so surprising that even smart people can &apos;t get it together .
why is that surprising ?
i just can &apos;t understand
why you would even lift a finger to help him .
well , i ... i could say
it &apos;s the compassionate physician in me .
but the truth is ,
i &apos;ll never not be paddy doyle &apos;s daughter .
i just want to know where he came from .
why ?
why does anybody trace their heritage ?
you didn &apos;t get the bullet out yet ?
yeah , maura . come on .
the body &apos;s been here at least 30 seconds .
oh . sorry .
so what should i do while i wait for ballistics ?
korsak said the wife and sister
gave you a list of enemies .
and a long one .
the gym managers high @-@ fived when we told them
who the victim was .
sounds like the whole place wanted this guy dead .
get this -- when he lost a squash match ,
he peed in his opponent &apos;s locker .
wait . he urinated in it ?
that is what &quot; peed &quot; means , yes .
his tires were slashed multiple times .
car was keyed .
any idea who did it ?
no idea .
that &apos;s why they were setting up the new security cameras .
mark cabot demanded it .
okay , so start with the gym members .
find out who &apos;s a registered gun owner .
great . thanks , jane .
yep .
are you looking through my personal files ?
well , if you don &apos;t want anyone looking ,
don &apos;t label them &quot; personal . &quot;
&quot; personal &quot; -- related to a person &apos;s private affairs .
you got patrick sr. &apos; s medical records ?
&quot; congestive heart failure , arthritis , emphysema ... &quot;
this man needs assisted living .
maura , you can &apos;t take this on .
it &apos;s temporary , jane .
i think you &apos;re nuts .
rizzoli .
i got a delivery now ?
you got a delivery ?
what are you doing here ?
you &apos;re a day early .
okay . i can come back .
no ! get over here .
mm . no , i &apos;m -- i &apos;m at work .
i don &apos;t care .
there you are .
why didn &apos;t you wake me ?
i didn &apos;t want you in my way .
wow . you cook , too ?
where did you get the eggs and all the vegetables ?
farmers &apos; market .
really ?
you &apos;re like a 17th @-@ century wife .
is that good or bad ?
well , it &apos;s fantastic . i &apos;ve always wanted a wife .
what do you want to do today ?
watch me churn butter or help me beat the dust from the rugs ?
oh , casey , i have to go to work .
oh , my bad . i showed up early .
well , i know . i just -- i --
what happened in my fridge ?
it met a bucket of soapy water and a sponge .
did -- did you throw the orange juice out ?
it was empty . i tossed it .
what d-- no ! no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no .
you can &apos;t throw the ketchup out .
jane , you make enough money to eat food that didn &apos;t expire in 2007 .
you were growing things in there .
and you did the laundry .
never put off till tomorrow what you can do today .
well , i just -- i feel guilty .
well , i was hoping you &apos;d feel loved .
yeah .
i do feel loved .
you do ?
do you ?
yes , i really feel loved .
morning !
good morning , ma !
okay , well , don &apos;t let me interrupt ...
charles .
someday , i &apos;m gonna make you call me casey .
look , i know you two are grown @-@ up ,
but i still don &apos;t approve .
oh , really ?
this coming from the woman who &apos;s canoodling with my boss .
jane , for heaven &apos;s sake , what &apos;s wrong with you ?
what are you doing here ?
your brothers are slobs , and i needed a place to stay .
is that ...
... sauted zucchini ?
fresh garlic and sea salt -- you want some ?
yes . - wait . do not encourage --
wait .
what ?
did maura kick you out
so she could move in grandpa patrick ?
she said she needed the guest house
for somebody who couldn &apos;t climb stairs .
who &apos;s patrick ? it &apos;s good .
patrick doyle , sr.
paddy &apos;s father ?
she gave my guest house to a criminal ?
it &apos;s not exactly your guest house , ma .
well , i certainly don &apos;t want to stay with him ,
nor do i want to stay where i am not wanted .
really ? that &apos;s good news .
unless it &apos;s with family .
excuse me .
are you sure , ma ?
because , you know , me and my lover
are going to be doing lots of things
that you don &apos;t approve of .
go ahead .
wait . but , ma , look .
you could get some tips for you and cavanaugh .
oh , for crying out loud , jane !
that &apos;s disgusting .
no , come on . i was kidding .
where are you going ? ma , come on .
i &apos;m gonna go to maura &apos;s spare bedroom .
what about patrick doyle ?
well , if he can stand it , so can i.
if you make her an honest woman ,
i &apos;ll call you anything you want , charles .
goodbye , jane .
bye , ma .
did you get frankie &apos;s bullet out ?
yes . and your mother hates me .
no . she loves your guest house .
and you , too .
she hardly said one word to me .
well , enjoy the silence for a while .
she &apos;ll be fine , unless patrick puts a hit out on her .
too soon ?
you have a tell , too .
and what is my tell ?
your jokes get a little edge when something &apos;s bothering you .
it &apos;s casey ?
i can &apos;t take my day off to be with him
because i have yet another homicide to solve .
that is a lie .
i could have totally taken a day off today , and i didn &apos;t .
you want to know why ?
yes , i do know why .
because you love solving homicides .
you love your work .
yeah , and i can &apos;t tell him that .
i feel guilty .
besides , the guy &apos;s been in town 10 hours --
he &apos;s already washed my underwear .
my thongs , maura .
that &apos;s awkward .
yeah , tell me about it .
and he cleaned out my refrigerator .
now , that , i approve of .
there are alternaria spores
and maybe even rhizopus on your pastrami .
jane , this isn &apos;t about casey . it &apos;s about you .
yeah , it is .
i can &apos;t be me and be his , too .
so , tell him .
how do people make this work ?
i mean , i love him . i want him to stay .
and i want him to go .
those are mutually exclusive desires .
yes , this much i know , maura .
hmm , look what i &apos;m seeing in the mucosa of the primary bronchi .
oh , thank god for mucosa .
a hair .
it &apos;s a canis lupus hair .
a dog . she had a dog .
yeah , but it &apos;s not merton &apos;s . it &apos;s not from a labradoodle .
maybe our killer had a dog , too .
hi , how many students had office hours
with rhonda at her home ?
just about to head over to b.c.u.
to get a list of everybody -- we can ask .
okay . we need to find out how many of them own dogs .
hey , i &apos;ve been going through
all of mark cabot &apos;s business dealings --
customers , vendors , clients .
so far , no one stands out .
what &apos;s the matter ?
oh , i was hoping you had something .
no hits on the bullet maura recovered
from mark cabot &apos;s body .
well , don &apos;t get discouraged .
i &apos;ve solved a lot of cases without ballistics .
what else you got ?
nothing .
except they don &apos;t make bigger douche bags than mark cabot .
what about the other gym members with the gun licenses ?
49 gym members have guns .
that &apos;s a hell of a lot of guns .
we should check &apos; em all .
the dean of the sociology department
has that list prepared .
let &apos;s go .
okay .
they &apos;re releasing him in two hours .
i can &apos;t face him alone .
i can go to b.c.u. alone .
maura can &apos;t go to souza @-@ baranowski prison alone .
go , jane .
oh ... the things i do for you .
sign there , there , and there .
thank you .
you have to sign for his wheelchair ?
well , it &apos;s government issued . he &apos;ll have to give it back .
oh , yeah , &apos; cause you &apos;re really tempted to steal a used wheelchair .
there are prisoners here in their 90s , jane .
well , this guy &apos;s a spring chicken .
that &apos;s my grandfather .
hello , mr. doyle . i &apos;m ...
i know who you are .
you look like that , uh ...
that woman , that , uh ... that hope .
she &apos;s my biological mother . i &apos;m dr. maura isles .
&quot; biological . &quot;
put a lot of stock in that , do you ?
biology ?
you gonna tell me
that you &apos;re , uh , paddy &apos;s daughter
&apos;cause my son knocked up some college girl ?
you should have never seen the light of day .
put him back , maura .
your girlfriend &apos;s right .
listen , sweetheart .
leave me here . i like it here .
i don &apos;t want anything to do with you .
great . sit here and rot .
maura , let &apos;s go .
oh , no , you don &apos;t .
oh , yes , we do .
you signed the paperwork .
patrick doyle &apos;s not our problem anymore .
he &apos;s all yours .
i &apos;m warning you .
don &apos;t push me where don &apos;t i want to go .
you don &apos;t got a choice .
this is just temporary .
as i told you ,
you &apos;ll be in assisted living in just a few days , mr. doyle .
and as i told you , take me back to my cell ,
and don &apos;t you call me &quot; mr. doyle . &quot;
what should she call you ? number 2492 ?
i said , take me back .
hey , you heard the man . you &apos;re our problem now .
until i can give you back to the state .
i can see where paddy got all of his lovely traits .
come on . we got to get back to work .
jane .
he is a hideous human being ,
but i can &apos;t just leave him here alone .
take me to southie .
that &apos;s great idea . we could dump him at 8th and i.
i got plenty of friends in southie .
oh , yeah ? like who , huh ?
mikey kelly ? big murph ? huh ?
duba shaughnessy ? they &apos;re all dead , patrick !
don &apos;t you call me patrick , lady .
no ! no !
i know . i know . i &apos;m coming back soon .
you said you &apos;d be here an hour ago .
i &apos;ve got all of rhonda &apos;s files here .
let &apos;s close this sucker
and get you off to canoodle .
who &apos;s barking ?
elsie .
hey , sergeant .
is -- is casey there ? - yeah .
jane .
hey , babe . how come you &apos;re not at work ?
it &apos;s a long story . listen .
um , elsie was trained to
assist soldiers in wheelchairs , right ?
yeah , why ?
i need a favor .
okay , that &apos;s enough , now . huh ?
you &apos;re beginning to bug me a bit , huh ?
good girl . yeah , you &apos;re a big girl .
don &apos;t read anything into that .
even psychopaths like dogs .
i know .
but thank you for bringing her .
at least he &apos;s stopped complaining .
i &apos;ll get her comfortable with him ,
and then we &apos;ll try some stuff .
he &apos;s like the soldiers with disabilities
i see all the time .
except he &apos;s a crook .
might be hard for you to believe , but he &apos;s scared .
of me , i hope .
scared of change .
see it in the military -- guys used to that life .
some start to think they can &apos;t live outside the system .
anyway , you two go back to work .
what ? no . you can &apos;t stay here .
i want you to go back to work so you get home sooner .
go . i got it .
thank you .
don &apos;t get too friendly . he &apos;s not moving in with us .
&quot; us , &quot; huh ? i like the sound of that .
how do we get patrick out of maura &apos;s house ?
i know a guy in the housing authority .
really ? you could pull a fix ?
not a &quot; fix . &quot; a favor .
just get him off the wait list and out of your hair .
okay , yeah . don &apos;t tell maura , but do it .
what did you get at b.c.u. ?
i spoke to the dean .
professor rhonda clark had a stellar reputation .
i brought her files and her personal belongings
from her office .
wow ! is that rhonda ?
yeah . hard to believe , huh ?
what do we blame -- the weed or the crunchy snacks ?
any of her students stand out ?
yeah , this one . peter kaufman .
he was actually rick &apos;s student ,
but it was up to rhonda to decide
whether to let peter into their phd program .
and ?
and according to the dean ,
rhonda washed him out .
peter didn &apos;t take it well .
she recorded his final oral presentation .
if this has anything to do with gruel for patrick
or where to hide the good silver ,
i &apos;m trying to catch up .
it &apos;s about dog hair .
oh ! did you find the breed ?
yes . it &apos;s a german shepherd .
high levels of dander ,
which explains the mucosal edema i found
in the lung tissue samples .
she was allergic ?
but she had a dog .
merton was labradoodle . no dander .
but if she had a histamine reaction ,
doesn &apos;t that mean that she inhaled the hair ?
yes .
and since she was still breathing ,
the hair wasn &apos;t in the water .
it means the hair could have been on the killer .
maybe the killer had a german shepherd .
the root ball &apos;s still intact . i could test the dog hair .
find out if the dog was on any medication .
that might help us identify it .
i &apos;ll see what i can do .
let &apos;s look at this student , peter .
he had motive . maybe he had a german shepherd .
peter &apos;s giving his oral presentation .
guess it &apos;s like an audition to get into the phd program .
sorry , peter . i have to stop you .
i &apos;ve listened to your presentation with grave concerns .
where is this material from ?
that &apos;s professor rhonda .
my own research , professor .
i have reason to suspect this is plagiarized .
no , it isn &apos;t .
i suspect your logistic regression analysis
is also based on someone else &apos;s research .
plagiarism is cause for immediate expulsion .
you can &apos;t just sit there and accuse me of plagiarism ,
you fat bitch .
hey , peter ! that is enough !
no . no !
you will not be continuing in this program .
you need to leave right -- - you can &apos;t do this to me !
you understand ? !
hey , hey , hey ! back off , pal !
that is one angry graduate student .
let &apos;s pick him up .
smell that ?
weed .
maybe peter was rhonda &apos;s dealer .
how much do you want ?
all of it .
killed her ? what are you talking about ?
i feel bad that she &apos;s dead .
she accused you of plagiarism .
okay , that pissed me off ,
and , yeah , maybe i shouldn &apos;t have smoked that blend
before i gave my presentation .
it makes me kind of paranoid .
kind of ?
listen . she was good people .
way smarter than her husband .
i always wished that she was my adviser , not him .
when we got stoned together --
you smoked with her ?
in the hot tub and at the house .
we &apos;d talk about the mismatch of social mores
in capitalist culture , the lack of legitimate aspiration ,
the breakdown in social bonds --
that &apos;s all very interesting , peter .
let &apos;s talk about why you attacked your hot @-@ tub buddy
when she kicked you out of the program .
you spend four years in college , two years in graduate school ,
and then , boom , someone says the &quot; p &quot; word ,
and you &apos;re out .
that was original work . it &apos;s all on this drive .
run it on one of the plagiarism search engines .
where were you last night ?
in my apartment with friends .
getting high ?
what else do i have to do now ?
we &apos;re gonna need a list of names to confirm that .
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m sorry .
don &apos;t ever apologize for being dedicated to your work .
so ... did your grad student have an alibi ?
oh , of course , so that &apos;s another dead end .
what about the german shepherd ?
there are 500 of those dogs in boston , so --
wait , no ! why are we talking about my work ? no .
did grandpa patrick make you want to jump on a cargo plane
back to afghanistan ?
don &apos;t hit me , but i , uh --
i kind of enjoyed being with him .
ow ! i said don &apos;t hit me .
well , korsak found him a spot in public housing ,
so i can probably can get him moved in a day or two .
he &apos;s spent almost half his life in prison .
and you &apos;ve spent almost half your life in the service .
yeah .
you can get used to anything , even come to depend on it .
hey , you should congratulate me .
i &apos;m a colonel .
oh , my god ! casey ! that &apos;s --
congratulations ! oh , my --
oh , we need some champagne .
could be i &apos;ll never --
never do anything as well as i do that .
what are you saying ?
i &apos;m about to hit 20 years .
i have a decision to make , jane .
well , what kind of decision ?
stay or go .
i &apos;m right where i thought i wanted to be .
where &apos;s that ?
in line to become a general .
i feel like an anthropologist .
he &apos;s actually kind of fascinating .
he &apos;s very regimented .
he has to eat exactly at 7 : 00 a.m.
are you making powdered eggs ?
yes .
he likes them overcooked .
do you cut the crusts off his toast , too ?
no .
just burn the edges and cut them into squares .
oh , so no triangles ?
your tell is showing . what &apos;s wrong ?
casey .
here i was thinking that he wanted to settle down .
he told me that he had to either accept or decline
his orders next month .
what does that mean ?
i think it means
that he loves the army more than me .
oh , jane .
i don &apos;t want to talk about this ,
or i &apos;ll never make it through the day .
when do we get the results back on the root ball ?
oh , uh , susie called this morning .
the german shepherd was on a drug for arthritis --
carprofen .
oh , my god . it &apos;s 6 : 58 .
oh , my god .
i told you -- if he doesn &apos;t eat exactly at 7 : 00,
then he &apos;s not gonna eat at all .
there he is .
will you give him his breakfast ?
what ? why me ?
i &apos;m wearing my pajamas , jane .
i &apos;m not hungry .
but it &apos;s powdered eggs and burnt toast
and freezer hash browns .
you eat it , then .
i don &apos;t like prison food .
i didn &apos;t either . but i got used to it .
so eat your breakfast .
no reason anymore .
there was a reason in prison ?
you think i &apos;m some sort of pathetic mobster .
but inside , i &apos;m still somebody in that prison .
well , life has given you another chance to be somebody
other than some forgotten mobster .
now eat your damn breakfast and thank maura for her trouble !
patrick jr. was my only son .
i was all he needed ...
until that -- that woman , that -- that hope , came along
and -- and changed things , turned him away from me .
yeah , well , that isn &apos;t maura &apos;s fault .
it &apos;s her fault i &apos;m gonna die out here .
paddy asked her to take you .
he what ?
but ...
yeah . he &apos;s punishing me .
i wanted to stay where i was .
i ...
i @-@ i told him , i ...
he put me outside ...
because ...
he wants to see me die ...
as a nobody .
maybe he put you out here so you could see
the one good thing he &apos;s done --
maura .
bruno . he looks nice .
mm , yes , he does .
did you just make an online @-@ dating love connection ?
funny .
i &apos;m pulling up all the registered german shepherds .
i always wanted one -- the good ones are direct and honest ,
but not hostile , like you .
thank you .
i &apos;m sorry i made a joke . is that my tell ?
your what ?
what tell ?
you have no idea what i &apos;m talking about , do you ?
is this a trick question ?
i &apos;m so thankful that some of the people i work with are guys .
no ! let &apos;s talk dogs , korsak .
for a guy running a billion @-@ dollar company ,
this mark cabot sure had a lot of time to go to the gym .
you still thinking he was killed by another member ?
maybe .
he was there every day and on every tournament team .
i asked myself the same question ,
so i looked through the company &apos;s minutes .
mark was never there . guy was a slacker .
well , maybe somebody on the board wanted him out .
his wife and sister were on the board , right ?
yeah , but they both have solid alibis .
and mark gave everyone motive .
he controlled everything , made all the big decisions ,
took all the credit .
i found six german shepherds
that live within 10 blocks of rhonda &apos;s house .
jane , there &apos;s a dog park near rhonda &apos;s house .
dogs need special tags to use it .
i &apos;m pulling up all the german shepherds .
wait a minute . your vet has to sign off on the forms .
i bet we can find out if any of those dogs
were on that drug that we found in the dog hair .
look at that name --
&quot; jaco &quot; the german shepherd .
owner is leslie cabot .
what the hell ? leslie cabot is our victim &apos;s sister .
it &apos;s here in the dog &apos;s records .
leslie cabot &apos;s german shepherd was on carprofen .
i don &apos;t get it . these two victims were strangers .
so why is his sister &apos;s dog &apos;s hair in her lungs ?
the murders are connected .
ever see &quot; strangers on a train &quot; ?
hitchcock .
two strangers each want someone dead .
they agree to do it for each other .
the perfect murders .
you can &apos;t set up a perfect murder in today &apos;s world
without talking to each other .
we can connect them through e @-@ mails
or texts or phone calls .
you can check , but i doubt you can find anything .
remember what rick said to us -- &quot; big brother &apos;s watching &quot; ?
he made sure that we couldn &apos;t make a link
between him and leslie cabot .
how ?
frost , check to see if rick &apos;s dog is registered
at leslie &apos;s dog park .
that &apos;s it , jane .
yeah . both merton and jaco have dog tags
and used the park .
that &apos;s where they met . that &apos;s where they planned the murders .
and they probably agreed never to contact each other
unless it was at that dog park .
smart .
very .
all right , let &apos;s talk motive .
why would leslie want her brother dead ?
she got fed up with doing all the work
while he took the credit ?
wait , wait . i found this in the minutes .
it was the one meeting mark attended .
last week , he had a secret vote
to remove a board member .
who was the board member ? who wasn &apos;t at that meeting ?
leslie cabot .
you think leslie figured out that mark was getting rid of her ?
what about rick clark ?
you think he wanted rhonda dead because she let herself go ?
frost , can you do a search ?
see if this graduate student plagiarized
the material on this drive .
sure .
what do all university professors want ?
tenure .
that &apos;s right .
she got it . he didn &apos;t .
you think that &apos;s the motive ? jealousy ?
okay , this is odd . there it is .
the material on this drive was published in a sociology journal .
so , peter &apos;s thesis was published a week after
she kicked him out of the program ?
相似度 99.7 %
oh , look who claims he wrote it -- rick clark .
that &apos;s why rhonda thought peter plagiarized it --
she probably read rick &apos;s article before it was published .
well , tenure is all about publication .
so , rick must have felt the pressure ,
which means he was competing with his wife
for the same tenure slot .
i &apos;ll call the dean and find out .
yeah , but we still don &apos;t have enough to arrest them .
why not ?
we don &apos;t have any evidence to connect them to the victims .
yeah , were there other contenders in line for that tenure slot ?
yes . yes . all right , thank you .
you were right -- rick and rhonda clark were in line
for the same tenure spot .
now that she &apos;s dead , it &apos;s his , isn &apos;t it ?
the dean &apos;s gonna announce it today .
that &apos;s motive --
that and the fact that they &quot; grew apart . &quot;
there has to be a way to get them , jane .
wait , there is .
let &apos;s pit them against each other .
mr. clark ? yes , hello .
this is detective rizzoli .
uh , we &apos;ve found some security footage
from one of your neighbors .
uh , we believe that it &apos;s your wife &apos;s killer ,
but we can &apos;t identify her .
would you be able to come down and look ?
yes , identify her .
do you see rick clark or leslie cabot ?
not yet .
thanks for doing this .
you know , you &apos;re not supposed to use your personal car for work .
it &apos;s new , and i like it ,
and would you rather be sitting in a police car ?
no .
hey , casey , you want to see a movie later ?
sure .
what are you doing ?
i &apos;m looking up movie listings .
stay close , casey . company .
hey , buddy .
that &apos;s not leslie cabot .
that &apos;s jenny cabot -- mark &apos;s wife .
well ... merton knows her . he &apos;s not barking .
look at that -- those dogs are friends .
so they met here .
talked dogs , bad marriages .
the police called me .
what ?
one of my neighbors got you on their security camera .
what do you mean ? they have a recording of me ?
they haven &apos;t identified you yet .
if i &apos;m going down , you &apos;re going down , too .
how could you not know your neighbor had a camera
aimed at your damn house ?
would you relax , okay ? it &apos;ll be fine .
yeah , fine for you , maybe .
i made sure there were no cameras .
hell , i even got you the gun .
which is where ? your house ? your car ?
dumbass .
in the ocean .
oh . what about you , huh ?
did you tell your girlfriend
you weren &apos;t just taking her dog for a walk , huh ?
you think leslie maybe ought to know
that you had her brother killed
so that she could save her job .
don &apos;t you dare .
looks like jenny married the wrong sibling .
wonder if mark knows
his wife was having an affair with his sister .
let &apos;s go .
all right .
at least , i didn &apos;t have my wife killed so i could take her job .
i hated my wife .
yeah , well , i hated my husb--
funnily enough , that remains the number @-@ one motive for murder .
we have some good news and some bad news .
the good news is --
we don &apos;t have you on security cameras , jenny .
the bad news --
you see that dog over there with her collar ?
that &apos;s a parabolic mic ,
so we do have you both admitting to murder .
oh , my god .
you said you wanted to live in southie .
it &apos;s a good facility .
just -- just leave me .
i &apos;m fine . leave me .
we &apos;ll visit you .
why ?
because it &apos;s the right thing to do .
because you &apos;re a lonely , angry , old gangster .
but you &apos;re also my grandfather ,
and you don &apos;t have anybody else ,
so take it before i change my mind .
you -- you look just like paddy right now .
maybe there is something to this biology thing .
so , blood is thicker than water .
the density of blood plasma in circulating blood cells
is roughly twice the density of water .
oh , my goodness ! patrick !
there , see ? he &apos;s gonna be fine .
bunny ?
yes !
patrick doyle .
look at you , james dean .
well , we grew up on the same block .
casey &apos;s going back to afghanistan .
for how long ?
i don &apos;t know .
he said he hadn &apos;t decided whether to re @-@ enlist .
he will , unless ...
unless , what ?
unless i marry him .
