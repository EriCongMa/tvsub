The woman tried to kill me.
If I drop Louise, it could provoke her.
You slept with her.
You can have something that all these other people can't.
What's that?
Anything you want.
How about I offer a million above asking?
It's your place now.
I'll call it in.
That's the type of knife
that's presumed to have killed Conrad Grayson.
Charlotte had quite a bit to say before leaving town.
Let's start with Emily is her sister.
What do you want?
Your assurance that,
when this thing with your dad explodes,
none of it lands on me.
Done. You won't even cross my mind.
You could have come for me, but you didn't.
You could have come for me!
Amanda. It's you.
Victoria.
She's not breathing.
Here. Call 911!
Okay. Come on.
Call for help! She's dying!
Victoria. Oh, thank God.
No. Give me the phone.
911. What is your emergency?
I need an ambulance at, uh, 3342 old Montauk highway.
Someone's been electrocuted by a power line.
She's unconscious, but breathing.
Margaux, Margaux, wait, wait, wait.
Come back upstairs. Let me explain.
No, there's nothing to explain.
I've become the target of a jealous mental patient
because of your inability to keep it your in pants.
It meant nothing, okay?
I was so determined not to lose her as a client
that I went too far.
Okay? I'm sorry.
Only because you got caught.
And it's not even the sex. It's the lies.
I thought maybe you had changed.
But I can't believe I let myself fall in love with you.
Hold on. What? You're in... you're in love with me?
No, no, wait, wait, wait, wait.
I can be better.
That's what makes this so hard.
Margaux Lemarchal.
As I live and breathe, what a lovely surprise.
Want to come up to my room
for some martinis and girl talk?
So you can try to poison me?
I'm onto your little game, Louise.
Whatever are you talking about?
Drop the act.
You locked me in that steam room on purpose.
Oh, that's funny.
I-I haven't got any missed calls from the authorities.
That must mean you don't have any proof.
Oh, the lengths you've gone to be with Daniel...
Seem to have succeeded,
considering how quickly you just stormed out of his building.
Except for one little problem...
You made an enemy out of me
in the process.
Nolan? Finally.
Been looking everywhere for you and Emily.
There's no hiding from the Southampton P.D.
How did you find me?
You tweeted a photo of this view
with the hashtag "Never leaving."
Oh, yeah.
I know why you guys are avoiding me.
I'm not, Jack.
I never got any of your calls.
That brag-tag of the view
was my phone's last act before committing cell-icide.
Don't ask.
This morning, I told Emily the investigation
into Conrad's murder was pointing towards David.
The next thing I know, Ben and I find an O.D.'d John Doe
with the murder weapon.
Now, she was clearly framing the guy,
But, Nolan...
Did Emily...kill him?
Okay, you're half-right.
Emily only planted the knife...
Oh, thank god.
After... Charlotte killed him.
What?!
Jack, it was self-defense.
T-the guy was a scumbag. He had it coming.
He was using Charlotte to get to David and take him out.
Emily's playing with fire here, man.
If... if she didn't cover her tracks,
we're all gonna get burned.
Let's hope she did, Jack,
because I'm still recovering from the first degree
I got from your dear old dad-in-law.
I'm sorry about what happened, man.
Oh, don't cry for me, Sergeant-ina.
I'll find a way to change those headlines.
Now...
If Emily would only tell her father the truth,
all our problems would be solved.
Okay. Got it?
Yeah.
Don't feel bad about not helping.
You were scared.
I wasn't scared.
She didn't deserve my help, or yours.
What? She was in need.
I was in need my whole life.
You were alive while the person
that you thought was your daughter suffered...
while I suffered...
And you did nothing. Why?
We have to move. You coming?
Please, I need to know.
Ems? I'm in.
What have you got?
Oh, good news and bad news.
Victoria's still alive.
What's the good news?
They're keeping her heavily sedated
to monitor the irregular rhythm of her heart.
Turns out she has one.
I'm still not hearing any good news.
This means you can talk to your father
without her running interference.
He made it very clear he does not want to talk to me.
Yeah, and he reacted that way because he watched his daughter
refuse to help a woman who was practically struck by lightning.
Once you explain how victoria betrayed him,
he will regret ever being CPR-certified.
What about the photos?
He had no explanation for them.
Uh, you didn't give him much of a chance,
confronting him the way you did.
I can't believe you're defending him
after everything that he's done.
Ems, I'm not.
I-I'm just trying to be rational.
Look, victoria's dance with the downed power line
has given you a second chance to win your father back.
But this time, you're gonna have to do it calmly,
and you're gonna have to do it soon,
before that black heart of hers starts ticking on its own again.
Oh, thank heavens.
Someone who can finally help me.
This is an emergency.
What is it?
Well, my dearest friend, Victoria Grayson,
has been in a terrible accident, and I must see her.
Well, are you family?
Oh, practically.
Just ask Daniel. He'll surely vouch for me.
Well, Mr. Grayson is not here,
and you shouldn't be, either, so let's go.
Oh. Oh, okay, okay.
Well, you know, instead of manhandling me,
could you just give these to her on my behalf?
Please. They're her favorite.
Okay.
Excuse us.
You never brought me flowers
When I was in the hospital.
Then again, you put me there.
Not now, mama.
Then when, Lou-lou? Hmm?
You've wasted so much time on your pathetic plan.
You need to find a way into mother Grayson's heart
Or it's gonna close up, just like mine did.
And what, exactly, is your brilliant idea?
Well, big Daddy's mother
couldn't stand the sight of me...
That is, until your brother
started kicking the inside of my stomach.
And how, exactly, am I supposed to get pregnant
with victoria's grandchild
If Danny said he won't sleep with me again?
Oh, men say a lot of things, Lou-lou.
But they only want one.
Hey, aren't you partners with that guy
that found Conrad Grayson's murderer?
I hear he's a stud.
Oh, cool your jets.
It could have been anyone who answered that call.
Yeah, but it was us.
And get this. Word is, the feds took over,
And they're bringing in some locals to help.
Where did you hear that?
I have my sources.
Feds? Sources?
All you need now is a mustache, Magnum.
I kept telling you this case was gonna pay off for me.
Porter. Meet Agent Taylor.
She's the FBI liaison
running point on the Grayson murder.
Please, call me Kate.
Ben Hunter. Very happy to offer my services.
I'm more familiar with this case than anyone here.
Well, I find that hard to believe,
given your partner's history with the major players.
That's why I was trying to keep my distance.
However, Ben here knows the case file inside and out.
Agent Taylor has requested
that you walk her through the case.
Hunter, you're flying solo.
And we are going to do everything that we can
to make Kate comfortable in our house.
Copy that.
Congrats, partner.
Excuse me.
Let's get started.
Mr. Grayson. How's your mother doing?
I'm sure she'll be fine.
Good.
The press must have made it sound more serious that it is.
Yeah.
Oh, one more thing.
This was left for you.
Thanks.
Someone started without me.
All right.
So you want to play.
Have it your way.
Oh, no.
Louise?
Who were you expectin', silly?
Oh, Miss.
Can I help you?
Uh, I'm here to see Victoria Grayson.
Oh, you, too, huh?
I don't think so.
Look, it's family only, all right?
So if you aren't on this list,
There's nothing I can do for you.
She is family.
Yeah. We need to talk.
What the hell were you thinking?
I knew you and Margaux had a lover's quarrel.
I just thought you might like to blow off some steam.
By tricking me into sleeping with you?
It wasn't a trick.
You wrote me a note on lemarchal's stationary,
you lunatic.
Y-you know what? I'm done. I'm done.
I'm dropping you as a client,
and I'm gonna make damn sure that you're sent back
to the institution you crawled out of.
How dare you judge me?
I never did that to you, not once!
I am the only person in Manhattan
that even gave you the time of day.
I've been nothing but good to you.
That doesn't excuse your actions.
You don't know me or what I've been through.
You have no idea how good you have it.
You're just a stubborn,
self-involved bastard who won't even visit
his sick mother in the hospital.
Get out.
Oh, get out of here!
Well, well, well, Nolan Ross.
Here he is, folks...
the reason why you won't be drinking today.
Are you trying to get me killed?
These people are too rich to be sober.
I just came here to tell you in person I quit.
Look, look, look. I get it.
Change of ownership means you get to negotiate up.
I respect that. Name your price.
I don't want your money.
From what I saw on TV,
it's not even yours to begin with.
Come on, guys.
All right. Let's get out of here.
All right. Let's go.
Well, I take it I will be reading about this mutiny
in your rags tomorrow.
Oh, I actually came to congratulate
you on this surprising acquisition.
Well, after you allowed David
to tar and feather me on live TV,
I had to seek refuge from the masses.
Just like I tried to do yesterday in your steam room.
I had no idea I was taking my life in my hands.
I'm going to have a hard time keeping that out of my rags.
Wouldn't you agree?
But...
there's something I can do to make it all go away, right?
Louise Ellis.
She has a membership here, and I recently discovered
she also has a sealed criminal record
that only you can hack into.
Oh, I just met Louise, but I already like her.
She's a sweetheart.
She's a violent psychopath who needs to be locked up.
Oh, Margaux, let's be honest.
I've known my fair share of psychopaths, and
little southern Sally is anything but...
Oh, besides,
any enemy of yours is a friend of mine.
No deal.
It's Vince Walsh.
Served some time upstate for assault
with a deadly weapon a few years back.
He had some misdemeanors, but nothing too serious.
The building's owner said he paid rent in cash.
So no money trail. What about his phone?
It's a burner. It's empty.
There's no saved numbers or texts.
He must have been erasing as he went.
Yeah, I already did a trace on the knife to see
where and when it was purchased to make sure it was his.
It was found on his person.
His DNA is all over it.
Never assume, rookie.
Could have been planted.
I've seen this before.
This was captured by a security camera at the parking lot
where the car that
tried to run down David Clarke was stolen.
Why didn't we have access to this?
Yeah, we're the FBI,
the prime beneficiaries of the Freedom Act.
There.
So the guy who murdered Conrad Grayson
also tried to take out David Clarke.
So what's next?
You tell me.
We have to talk to David Clarke.
Bingo.
The doctor says the next few hours are critical,
but she expects Victoria to recover.
But I'm sure you wanted otherwise.
You don't understand.
I think I do.
When you said that you didn't help Victoria on purpose,
I was shocked.
The Amanda that I remember,
she cared about every living creature.
But I am not the man that I was,
and I expect that the life that you've lived
has hardened you, too.
Hardened me?
You have no idea what I've been through
because of what she did.
She took everything from us. She's lying to you.
How can't you see that?
You're lying, too.
Why are you pretending to be somebody else?
I did it all for you.
To punish the people who hurt you.
I would have done anything for the dad that I lost.
But you're right. You're not that man.
You were alive the whole time.
Those photos prove that you were right there.
If I was...
there is nothing that would have kept me
from getting to you.
I did not take those photos.
Then who did?
Code blue!
Doctor! What's happening?!
Bring in the crash cart.
Lost her pulse.
Charge the paddles.
Yes, doctor.
Gel.
Gel.
Completely charged.
You're charged to 200.
Wait.
Hold.
I think we're stable.
Standing by. Doctor?
Her rhythm's back.
David.
Oh, God.
Victoria. It's okay. I'm here.
It's okay.
Your rhythm has returned to normal,
and your levels are stabilizing nicely.
You were very lucky that, when you got shocked,
David was there to administer CPR.
You saved my life?
I'd like to take you up for an MRI,
if you feel up to it.
I think I can manage as long as David accompanies me.
Okay, great.
Actually, I'll need a moment of his time.
Agent Kate Taylor from the FBI.
What is this about?
That's between me and Mr. Clarke.
It's okay, Victoria. It's okay.
Did we meet when I was in D.C.?
No. I'm from Criminal Investigation.
I'm here about Conrad Grayson's murder.
The body of a man was discovered with a knife
that had conrad grayson's DNA on it.
What does that have to do with me?
I have reason to believe that this is the same man
who tried to run you down last week.
Ever seen him before?
You're a granddad now.
One more life in your hands.
Uh, he doesn't look familiar.
Our records suggest he may have been taking orders
from someone else, so
I'm gonna have to ask you to come with me for your protection.
Well, as I told your, uh, bosses in D.C.,
I, uh, finally have my life,
and I want to live it free of their intrusion.
Also, I'm not leaving the hospital until Victoria's recovered.
So if that's all...
Just a few more questions, Mr. Clarke.
Emily?
What are you doing here?
Jack, hey.
Sorry I haven't returned your calls.
Well, if you had, you'd know the FBI is in town,
Investigating that O.D. and Conrad's murder.
They have an agent talking to your dad right now.
I saw. Did she order a trace on the murder weapon yet?
As a matter of fact, she did.
It's gonna lead right back to the man you found it on.
I made sure of it.
Conrad Grayson was a monster.
The world doesn't care who killed him.
They're just happy he's dead.
The FBI wants this case closed asap, trust me.
I hope you're right.
'cause I can't take much more of this.
Wait, if you're here, did you tell him?
What happened?
We were interrupted.
There's still...
a lot that I don't understand, but...
it's a start.
Yeah.
Officer Porter.
Yeah, okay. Thank you.
Home Office finished the trace.
The knife that killed Conrad did belong to Vince.
Looks like he's our perp.
That's good news.
For you. That means I owe you a drink.
Looks like today you're the one that needs cheering up,
so...let me return the favor.
My new bartender's the best.
Your bartender?
Well, I followed your advice to take what I wanted.
Turns out it was this club.
Well, getting what you want is, uh,
easier said than done sometimes.
Why? You're a one-percenter.
Well, not everything can be bought, I'm afraid.
But I'm so glad
you got this little slice of happiness, hmm?
I'm in the service industry now,
so my happiness is contingent on yours.
What say we see how many drinks it takes
to make me good at my job?
Those photos...
Who took them?
How did you have them?
How did you have them?
You stole them from my safe-deposit box,
and you took that knife.
The investigation of Conrad's murder was heating up.
I had to lead them away from you.
By handing them my knife? If they link that to me...
They won't.
I've traced everything back to him.
You're completely clean.
Who are you?
A daughter who would do anything to protect her father.
Protecting me, that's not your job.
That's why I told you in my journals to forgive.
Those journals detailed every single person
who had a part in destroying you.
What did you expect me to do?
You killed Conrad. What kind of forgiveness is that?
That's my decision for my life!
It's not the one I wanted for you.
I was never gonna have a normal life,
thanks to people like Victoria, who stole it away from me.
You're wrong about Victoria. Y-you were only 9 years old.
How dare you take her word over mine?!
I am your daughter.
You don't know the whole story.
Neither do you.
I dedicated my entire life to you.
I punished your enemies. I cleared you name.
I never asked for your help!
I have a distinct feeling of deja vu.
We had a deal.
You were gonna stay out of it.
I don't want to fight.
Then why are you here?
Well, I was feeling a little guilty
about not visiting my mother in the hospital,
but only made it as far as this beach,
looked over, saw you,
and curiosity got the best of me.
Well, now that is satisfied,
the hospital's only a few miles that way.
Wait, are you crying 'cause my mother survived?
Ah, you always did try to save me from her.
And you just kept crawling back.
Oh, says the girl obsessed with her.
I heard you made it to the hospital.
You wanted to see your handiwork?
Only karma can claim responsibility for that.
Oh. So you told him, didn't you?
Listen, I know firsthand you can fake tears,
but I bet real ones don't come easy.
You dedicated your life to a father you barely knew,
what did you expect to happen?
I expected to have a chance.
But at least I had the guts
to stand up to your vile mother.
Oh, so that's it, is it?
One fight with dad and you're giving up?
Okay.
Well, glad to know
the hell you put me through was for nothing.
What a waste.
David.
How are you feeling?
Tired.
But much better.
What's wrong?
What do you remember about last night?
We were on the couch.
You noticed my earrings.
Then...
Emily came through the door.
She was so angry.
She's not Emily Thorne.
She's my daughter, Victoria.
She's Amanda.
I need the truth. Did you know?
I never could find you
in the eyes of the girl claiming to be Amanda.
So I had a dna test done,
which Emily changed to prolong her lie.
As time went on,
I became more and more convinced of the truth,
so I confronted her.
She attacked me and had me locked up.
So you knew... that she was my daughter,
and you painted her as an enemy?
She is my enemy, David.
Things transpired between us that can't be undone.
And I knew that she would have to come out on her own terms.
I was terrified that if I told you or anyone else,
She would put me away again,
and I couldn't go back there, David.
David.
It must be overwhelming.
But it is the god's truth.
Just get some rest.
The nurse gave you something to help you sleep.
So what's it like, being a southern Kennedy?
oh, no.
Don't tell me you bought into that hogwash?
Oh, trust me.
My mama was definitely no Jackie o.
The only thing I've read about your big brother, Lyman,
has made him out to be congress' golden boy.
Well, everything I've seen
makes you out to be the bad guy.
People will believe whatever they read,
which is why I always go with my gut.
...Which is oversaturated at the moment.
If you'll excuse me.

What?
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Can't I just have a normal friend?
Mr. Clarke, will you be spending the night?
Yeah. Yeah, Dr. Albright said it'd be fine.
It is. We just need you to fill out some forms.
You're coming with us.
What are you doing?
Stop or she's dead.
Okay!
Okay. I'll do anything.
Don't hurt her.
I was never here.
What happened? Is anyone hurt?
Thank you for meeting me.
I know I didn't deserve your help
after the way I spoke to you.
You owe me an explanation.
You're right. I do.
The story about me being stabbed in prison
as a cover to sneak me out is true.
But it wasn't Conrad.
It was a rival of his who was...much worse.
This man asked me to do terrible things.
But I refused.
Until he showed me a photo of a girl
that I thought was my daughter.
He threatened to kill her if I didn't cooperate.
So I did what I had to do...
...Until I heard about her death.
And then, the next day, I escaped,
but not before I made him pay for what he did to me.
Where did you go?
Off the grid.
Till I heard about Conrad and my name being cleared.
That was your doing, wasn't it?
I am so proud of you, Amanda.
But I can't be your father.
Why?
You saw what happened in there.
It's too dangerous.
You have no idea what I'm capable of.
You should let me help you.
No. I already lost you once.
I'm not gonna let it happen again.
You have to let me take care of this.
It's my turn to protect you.
I love you, Amanda...
...Infinity times infinity.
Right here, sir.
Daniel, you came.
Daniel, please.
You know, Margaux told me she loved me last night.
I wanted to... Say it back,
but I don't even know
if I'm capable of feeling anything real anymore.
I've closed myself off to it.
And it would be real easy to blame Emily for that,
but this goes further back.
Seeing what you're doing to David now,
knowing what you were capable of all those years ago...
You blame me?
You think you really know what happened?
Well, here it is.
Your father's business practices
forced me to make a despicable choice.
It was either my lover's life or my son,
and I sacrificed David and chose you.
Daniel, I will always choose you.
No. No. This is what you do.
This is exactly what I'm talking about.
There is always an explanation for how and why you love
because you're terrified to be alone.
Look at you now. You're alone.
So thanks. Thanks, Mom. Thanks.
Thanks for being a cautionary tale...
one that I won't dare let happen to me.
Yeah, you can put it there. Thank you.
Listen, I'm sorry about everything.
Can I just... I just need to see you.
Wow. Resorting to actual research?
Oh, Margie, you know it's never wise
to show desperation in the middle of a negotiation.
Negotiation?
Does this mean you've reconsidered my offer?
It means I've come to counter.
And while I do admit that my interest in the subject
has been piqued since we last spoke,
my price for unsealing criminal records and the like
has just gone up considerably.
And what do you want?
Well, since that travesty
you called an interview with David Clarke,
public's practically drawing
horns and a pointy tail on my image.
And let me guess.
You would prefer angel wings and a halo.
Well... Well, that's a start.
And then it burned down.
That's too bad.
Sounds like the Stowaway was my kind of place.
It was...
It was my home since I was a kid, you know.
I haven't had roots like that in a long time.
Bureau moves me around a lot.
Where are you from originally?
Up north, where a girl could only dream
about growing up this close to the ocean.
Must have been nice.
Selfishly, I was hoping that, uh,
this case would last the whole summer.
Well, you work fast.
There's nothing wrong with that.
Whoa, man.
Hey, sorry.
Hey, hey. Sorry, guys. Next round's on me.
Oh, look who it is.
It's detective Porter to the rescue.
Come on, man. Let's... let's get you home.
So it's you and the fed, huh? You guys on a little date,
or did the bureau already offer you a job?
Or is it both?
That's enough.
Screw you, man.
What is your problem?
You're my problem.
You've been here all of what, a month?
Man, I been busting my ass on the force for years.
You and I both know that that should be me. Oh!
You think I like being constantly reminded
of the man who took my family away from me?
I never wanted this case. You know that.
This isn't about me. It's about you.
For some reason, you think that the whole world
is out to screw you, and it is not.
There will be other cases.
If you don't let this one go...
You're gonna lose your badge, man.
You okay?
Yeah, yeah. I'm fine. Sorry.
So, your dad won't tell you
who actually kept him prisoner all these years?
No.
And I think it's for the best.
What?!
This Conrad wannabe is one of the only things
that is keeping you from finally reuniting with your father.
Look, he doesn't want me to be a part of it.
He asked me to promise.
But, Ems...
I made up my mind.
I want a relationship with my father.
He said he's gonna take care of it, so until then,
I'll just keep chipping away at the hold Victoria has on him.
I've got a little crazy missile with her name on it.
Victoria won't know what hit her.
Trust me.
Well, let's talk about that in the morning.
It's been a long day.
Yeah. Yeah, it has.
Goodnight.
