the state has recently received the evidence that
the defendant has attempted to interfere with the judicial process .
bail is hereby denied .
i thought i &apos;d be leaving with you .
it &apos;s a betrayal .
maybe it &apos;s from mom &apos;s work .
this is getting crazy .
is that dad ?
they &apos;re just trying to scare mom .
maybe there &apos;s a reason she should be scared .
do we tell mom ?
they sent them to hurt her , so i say no .
hello , america . i &apos;m duke roscoe .
as always , i swear to tell the truth ,
the whole truth and nothing but the truth .
i turned away from my shopping cart for a second ,
and she was gone .
three months ago ,
two @-@ year @-@ old jamie willens disappeared .
her mother cheryl claimed she was snatched
from her shopping cart in a chicago grocery store .
someone kidnapped my baby girl .
the police looked high and low for jamie
and this mysterious kidnapper .
if you have jamie , please ... please bring her home .
and they found nothing . why ?
because she &apos;s lying , people !
she killed her kid .
shorter clips . make it shorter clips .
grab the attention of the jury .
cheryl willens killed her baby ,
and i have learned a reason
ms. willens was in the store at all :
to buy condoms .
don &apos;t need that .
just cut it off at &quot; killed her baby . &quot;
... cheryl willens &apos; freedom ,
the murdering mom took her own life ,
hanging herself from her closet door .
he &apos;s a prince , isn &apos;t he ?
the gift that keeps on giving .
do you have him from last night ?
uh ... the last file .
aw , come on , you know you &apos;re just managing a disaster here .
it &apos;s the network lawyer
making one last stab at a settlement .
you &apos;ve been shedding advertisers
like a dog sheds fleas .
good thing we have a lot of fleas to shed .
you really want to go to court ?
your client committed suicide ,
and you &apos;re just looking for someone to blame .
and anyway , i just got in from l.a. and ordered a massage .
why would i want to go back so fast ?
what are you doing at that network anyway ?
you used to be the cool one with all the tattoos .
i &apos;m still the cool one .
shh . i &apos;m listening to your client .
you know what ? i &apos;m glad she &apos;s dead .
that &apos;s right ,
because the more guilty people who commit suicide ,
the less will crowd the courts .
intent , disregard .
you &apos;ve got a client that &apos;s out of control , emily .
he &apos;s not my client , the network is my client .
yeah , well , tell your client
their spokesman is doing everything he can
to raise the settlement amount , right now we &apos;re at ...
... $ 3 million .
after duke &apos;s show tonight , my guess is
it &apos;ll be up to five .
give me a call .
we &apos;re not in a position to be charging retail .
don &apos;t worry , she &apos;ll come in at 2.5 .
will that be enough ?
he wants to go to trial .
talk to him , tell him how unpredictable a trial is .
yeah , cary , just roll back that one piece .
i want to see what i missed before .
yeah , i want to go ...
just , uh , want to be ready for cross @-@ examination .
i figure he &apos;ll try to make me out to be a money @-@ grubber .
don &apos;t you think ?
tim , i don &apos;t think we want to go to trial .
why ?
it &apos;s hard to go up against duke &apos;s right of free speech .
yes , but , we &apos;ll ... we &apos;ll have the jury &apos;s sympathy , right ?
we &apos;re more likely to get
a fair settlement if we don &apos;t go to trial .
but a trial will keep jamie &apos;s face out there .
i know she &apos;s been missing a year and a half ,
but i still think my daughter &apos;s alive .
you know he &apos;s still on the tv
saying that my wife is burning in hell ?
i know .
and people say , &quot; don &apos;t watch it . &quot;
but he has fans , and ...
people still phoning me .
and i don &apos;t have a tv show ,
and i don &apos;t have anybody to listen to me .
and i can answer him in court .
tim , you don &apos;t want to be obsessing on this .
you talked about using that settlement money
to search for your daughter .
if we settle now , that &apos;s money you could use .
if you go to court , i don &apos;t know if you &apos;ll ever ...
you think i should do this ?
settle ?
yeah .
what happened ?
lots . where were you ?
oh , with tim .
that &apos;s right . how is he ?
he &apos;s fine . what happened ?
yeah , yeah , come on , come on , i &apos;ll get you caught up .
the network lawyers are coming over in an hour .
that clip from last night really did the trick .
they &apos;re settling ?
conference room in an hour .
i don &apos;t even think they watch their own show .
they &apos;re afraid of the bad publicity .
i &apos;m borrowing you .
you &apos;re ... ?
i &apos;m sorry .
kettle corn for you .
tell him to wait , margie .
david lee . family law .
oh , right . i &apos;m so sorry .
you &apos;re the divorce lawyer .
yes , i &apos;m the divorce lawyer .
uh , yes , well , let him read a magazine .
we &apos;re starting up a softball league ,
and i want to know if you &apos;re up for playing first base ?
joking .
i need you at a meet and greet in 45 minutes to hand @-@ hold a client .
upstairs .
oh , uh , wait , um ,
i &apos;ve got a settlement
on the duke roscoe case in an hour , so ...
yes , at the moment , we &apos;re the only department that makes money ,
so we outrank .
see you in 45 minutes .
did you want this closed ?
i &apos;m tired of being the one who has to hand @-@ hold the clients .
you know , they send me off to get a client to agree to do something
i @-@ i &apos;m not even involved with .
because they send me off to hand @-@ hold the client .
you &apos;re babbling .
i know . thank you .
look , it &apos;s not a conspiracy .
you &apos;re good at it .
that &apos;s what my brother used to say to get me to do chores :
&quot; alicia &apos;s good at it . &quot;
i &apos;ve worked two months on this duke case , and now that they &apos;re settling ,
i &apos;m off on some divorce case , and cary gets all the glory .
yeah .
life stinks .
door .
okay ... we don &apos;t need to make this any bigger than it is .
the network doesn &apos;t want a long , drawn out trial .
we would like to move on .
you mean from cheryl willens &apos; suicide
or the loss of ten sponsors ?
you don &apos;t need to sell anymore ; we &apos;re here .
that wasn &apos;t selling ; that was rubbing it in .
over the phone , will and i talked about $ 2 million .
actually , we talked about $ 3 million
and a retraction .
oh . i must have misheard .
the network might be able to go to 2.5,
but any retraction would have to be worked out separately with duke .
we only advise on content .
well , then you might have to throw in ... something extra ?
then ... let &apos;s haggle .
alicia , there you are .
carla browning .
hello , mrs. florrick .
i think i &apos;m a fan .
thank you . i think .
chocolate raisins ?
no , thank you .
it &apos;s funny , most divorce lawyers have kleenex .
yes . i find it harder for my clients to cry
when their mouths are filled with m &amp; m &apos;s .
have you been to many divorce attorneys , ms. browning ?
a few .
my husband and i seem to have a series of relapses ...
him swearing to change , me forgiving , him forgetting ,
both of us repeating .
i think i &apos;m done .
morning .
point me in the direction of the settlement conference .
i moved out about a week ago ,
and he &apos;s been calling at all hours .
morning .
threatening calls ,
saying inappropriate things to our sons .
i understand .
but i must warn you ,
filing for a restraining order against your husband
could set the stage for a very ugly divorce .
mr. roscoe , we didn &apos;t expect you .
don &apos;t get up ... i &apos;ll just , uh , help myself back here .
we would need mr. willens to agree to not speak to the press , of course .
you got any cream cheese ?
jennette ?
can you get some cream cheese for mr. roscoe , please ?
and , uh , fruit . uh , pineapple .
pineapple , too . and a bib .
got it .
mr. willens would have to agree
to no future civil action .
all this is outlined in paragraph six , um ,
if you &apos;d take a look at that paragraph right there .
i just want to add
that there will be no formal retraction agreement ,
and the amount is subject to change ...
i &apos;m curious ... what is the amount ?
how much you guys paying ?
$ 2.5 million .
is mr. willens gonna be paying that out of his own pocket ,
or is your law firm gonna be helping him out ?
mr. roscoe .
the network would prefer to handle this ... quietly .
love quietly .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m gonna say this quietly .
if the network pays one red commie cent ,
i &apos;m gonna quit the network ,
and i &apos;m gonna take my nine million viewers with me .
if i have to broadcast
from a barge off the coast of south carolina ,
i &apos;ll do it ,
rather than surrender my right of free speech .
this isn &apos;t about revenge .
i don &apos;t want to hear any more excuses , all right ? !
my husband is a very dangerous man ,
and i &apos;m scared .
you understand that , don &apos;t you , mrs. florrick ?
i do ?
about my husband .
um ... who is your husband ?
oh , i thought david told you .
and i just assumed . alicia , i &apos;m sorry .
my married name isn &apos;t browning .
it &apos;s childs .
her husband is glenn childs , the state &apos;s attorney .
carla thought you &apos;d be sympathetic .
david is being euphemistic .
given how glenn &apos;s been acting ,
i thought i &apos;d need a secret weapon .
and that would be me ?
yes .
okay .
the appeal is looking good .
we may not even need to put you on the stand .
the more i can make this a battle
between childs and me and not about sex , then i win .
sounds smart .
what &apos;s the matter ?
what happens next ?
you win the appeal and ... ?
and i get a new trial .
right . you get bond .
i want to go home , alicia .
what does that look like ?
home ? what does it look like ?
looks like family .
and you want to run again ?
i don &apos;t know .
people want me to run .
i &apos;m working on a divorce case , peter , and i just ...
i see how easily people fall back into old habits .
but that won &apos;t happen to us .
why won &apos;t we ?
because we see the problem .
and we &apos;ll know how to avoid it .
i have to go .
all rise for the honorable judge abernathy .
uh , no , no .
please , everybody , sit .
my goodness .
we &apos;re crowded today .
i think that , uh , has something to do with me , your honor .
yes , mr. roscoe , i do believe you &apos;re right .
well , you &apos;re welcome .
thank you , your honor .
all i want is a fair shake , even though , uh ,
i would imagine our politics , uh , are night and day .
your honor , is duke representing himself here ?
no , no , it &apos;s all right , mr. gardner .
a smidgen of informality is , uh , allowed us all .
and yes , mr. roscoe , i clearly admit
that we probably would agree on very little ,
but this court is a blind court , and i will endeavor to be fair .
thank you .
talk about playing the refs .
yep , he &apos;s good .
your honor , the defense moves for a summary dismissal
based on the first amendment .
the plaintiff would deny mr. roscoe the right to speak his mind ...
no , your honor .
we want to deny mr. roscoe the right to slander and lie .
the truth is an absolute defense .
i &apos;ve been nothing but truthful about that child killer .
your honor , if you &apos;re gonna yell &quot; fire &quot;
in a crowded theater , there damn well better be a fire .
okay , counselors , thank you .
uh , a second .
it &apos;s like lucy with the football .
he &apos;s gonna screw us again .
mr. gardner , you argue that the first amendment
guarantees the right to speak but not the right to lie .
i agree with that statement .
but our case will be decided on
very narrow grounds , mr. gardner , ms. lockhart .
uh , to use your example , it &apos;s not enough to prove
that there was no fire in the theater .
you must also prove
that mr. roscoe knew there was no fire
or had a reckless disregard for the facts .
okay , cary , kalinda ,
this now turns into a fact @-@ finding case .
who was leaking duke all his information in the police investigation ?
we need to find out what he was given
so we can prove he was lying .
oh , and , alicia ,
you keep on tim .
hand @-@ hold him , make sure he stays on the reservation .
actually , alicia needs to split her time with the childs &apos; divorce .
oh , right .
okay , cary , you stay with him . hand @-@ hold him .
yes . the woman is a murderer .
nothing else matters .
look , we all want to save face here ,
so let &apos;s chat .
outside the spotlight ; duke can &apos;t know ; just you and me .
and if any money changes hands , it &apos;s out of the press .
can we have a secret handshake ?
8 : 00 tonight , my hotel .
cheryl willens killed her child .
your spray pattern &apos;s like a fingerprint , k.
hi , frank .
what do you need ?
why do you think i need anything ?
there &apos;s eight open alleys , you &apos;re in the one next to me .
willens kidnapping , everything you got .
and what do i get out of it ?
satisfaction of doing right thing
it &apos;s an ongoing investigation .
the lindbergh baby is an ongoing investigation .
what do you need ?
the 911 tapes ?
yeah , the 911 tapes .
and the investigative reports .
they &apos;re under lock and key
upstairs is upset that
someone &apos;s leaking this stuff to duke roscoe .
okay .
two shots ; whoever hits closest .
i win ,
you give me everything .
911 and the reports .
and if i win ?
okay , you first .
go for it .
not bad . your turn .
that &apos;s right , you &apos;re a heart man , frank .
put up or shut up , k.
let me start by saying ,
although this office may not have the trappings of a courtroom ,
both parties have agreed to arbitration ,
and as such , my decisions have the force of law .
do both parties understand ?
we seem to be only one party .
as you know , mrs. childs ,
your husband is a busy man .
he &apos;s asked me , as his lead attorney ,
to handle matters in his stead .
there are no matters to handle in his stead .
you signed a prenuptial agreement , mrs. childs .
the only matter to discuss is when are you moving out .
the matter to discuss is the amount of carla &apos;s spousal support
and whether she &apos;s going to allow mr. childs to visit his children at all .
you seem to be taking for granted
that my client would ignore a legally @-@ executed contract .
why would he do that , mrs. childs ?
because of her .
tell your client
that if he doesn &apos;t make it to our next arbitration ,
i will tell mrs. florrick
what i found on his laptop .
is that supposed to scare him ?
yes .
so you &apos;re using me for leverage .
yes .
does that make you uncomfortable ?
it makes me mistrustful .
so use me back .
i know exactly what you &apos;re going through .
i ... my uncle died .
hardest day of my life .
ruptured ulcer .
the whole ... the ...
god .
then my aunt insisted on having an open casket .
i have no idea why .
to get to see the dead body ?
you are playing with fire .
who let you in here ?
it &apos;s my family .
let me show you the way out , mr. childs .
you &apos;re poisoning her against me .
you want to talk to me ,
you phone my assistant and you make an appointment ,
but don &apos;t you ever come into my office without my permission .
you know , she was fine .
carla was happy until you talked to her .
oh , my god .
are you blind ?
i have two sons .
don &apos;t you touch me !
i have a life !
you know those envelopes on your doorstep--
they &apos;re just the beginning . i have a lot more .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
don &apos;t play stupid with me .
those photos , the dvds--
i have eight years of evidence .
then use it !
who &apos;s stopping you ?
security , 27th floor , please .
you want to make this about family ?
fine . i can make it about family , too .
look , well ,
your only play is to win the sympathy of the jury .
they get so outraged , they ignore jury instructions ,
and they award your poor widower something .
actually , i have another play .
i make your network look so bad ,
they pay the four million .
four million , is it now ?
uh @-@ huh , and that &apos;s cheap .
did i tell you i just got a 911 tape
of a distraught cheryl willens phoning the police
about her missing daughter ?
now i know you &apos;re bluffing .
yep .
just me and a tape recorder
doing a great imitation of a panicked mom .
so did it hurt to have it removed ?
your tattoo .
no , it &apos;s still there .
makeup .
you &apos;re kidding .
nope .
delay the trial ,
ask for a continuance ,
let duke &apos;s head cool and i &apos;ll get you the two million .
nah , i think i &apos;ll take a chance with this jury .
i &apos;ll send you the 911 tape .
i was talking to hannah morris back from the old firm .
that really got bigger , huh ?
it &apos;s my monopoly board .
i keep buying property .
hannah said you &apos;ve been on some kind of sexual sabbatical
for the last six months .
that &apos;s funny .
now , how would hannah know that ?
the woman keeps tabs on you , will .
how far down does it go ?
pretty far .
so we &apos;re not gonna get any work do ne tonight , are we ?
that &apos;s up to you .
be right back .
yeah , what &apos;s up , diane ?
you near a tv ? check out duke .
why ?
what &apos;s he ... what &apos;s he saying now ?
i can &apos;t do it justice .
... hypocrisy from a bunch of
limo liberal lawyers at stern , lockhart &amp; gardner .
and as always , i have left it to you ,
my civilian journalists
to come up with something on will gardner .
yeah , i get it ; he &apos;s got a big megaphone .
so we just got to take it , thick skin ...
here &apos;s will gardner sneaking into a hotel room
with the wife of the hooker @-@ loving ,
toe @-@ sucking state &apos;s attorney , peter florrick .
here you go , will .
truth is the absolute defense .
well , that explains the sabbatical .
it was that rape case , the one we lost .
we were asking questions at the hotel .
seems perfectly innocent .
okay , can we do some work now ?
i &apos;m serious .
it was that case , christy barbosa .
and of course it required going to a hotel .
we were asking questions .
it &apos;s what led us to the witness .
so you &apos;re sleeping with will ?
please , god , no , no !
where is your location , ma &apos;am ?
you need to tell me your location .
uh , a market. i &apos;m ... i &apos;m in quick mart .
my @-@ my baby , she &apos;s gone !
okay , ma &apos;am , an officer is on the way .
i &apos;ll need you to stay on the line .
i told her she was bad .
the last thing i to ... oh , god !
she @-@ she was crying and ...
please , god , please !
oh , god ! she was crying. please , god .
you all right ?
oh , yeah , yeah .
i just , uh ... you couldn &apos;t sleep ?
oh , sweetheart .
how are you doing at school ?
good .
are you getting a divorce ?
no , no. that &apos;s just a case .
who &apos;s will gardner ?
another google alert ?
yeah .
it &apos;s just a misunderstanding .
he &apos;s my boss. we were working on a case , and we went
to a hotel to ask some questions .
and now people are trying to make it into something it &apos;s not .
zach says you went to a divorce lawyer .
yes .
when i was angry , a week after everything happened .
but you &apos;re not angry now ?
no .
i &apos;m just trying to be ... collected .
all right . good night .
good night , sweetheart .
grace ?
did anything come for me at the apartment that i didn &apos;t get ?
like what ?
i don &apos;t know . a package or something ?
no .
good night .
good night , sweetheart .
the 911 tape has no probative value , your honor .
it is a naked attempt to inflame the passions of the jury ,
and gain sympathy for his client .
cornerstone of our case
is that duke roscoe was knowingly wrong on the facts .
we need the 911 tape
to show his facts were , at the very least , wrong .
your honor , i know you will try to be impartial here
despite your political differences with my client .
oh , come on. stop playing the ref , all right ?
and stop carrying out a jeremiad against my client .
what ?
he obviously caught you with your pants down ,
and now you want to ...
okay , you two .
such fireworks here .
your honor ,
all we ask for is a compromise .
that will prove to us your fairness .
what compromise ?
either we play the tape or we don &apos;t .
&quot; please , god . no , no .
my baby is gone . i ... &quot;
question : &quot; i would like to help you , ma &apos;am ,
but i need your location . &quot;
i want to shoot myself .
answer : &quot; oh , god .
&quot; oh , god .
i need help now . &quot;
question : &quot; ma &apos;am , where are you ? &quot;
&quot; my god , my god . &quot;
unintelligible .
the nice thing about liberals ,
they love to compromise .
duke was clearly leaked the police report .
but there are holes in the report
he &apos;s filling in from other sources .
what sources ?
i don &apos;t know . he has a lot of anonymous sources
on his web site .
civilian journalists with e @-@ mails like patrickhenry76,
reaganrules , thedukesman .
i say we put the son of a bitch on the stand .
where am i going ?
hey , bob . can you tell me where i &apos;m going ?
there &apos;s no court hearing today .
am i moving cells ?
you are .
glenn .
peter .
we &apos;re trying to end the coddling of high @-@ profile prisoners .
so you &apos;re putting me in with the general population , huh ?
yes .
it &apos;s a bit of a clumsy move , isn &apos;t it , glenn ?
you know , even at our worst ,
we never went after each other &apos;s families .
i &apos;m the one in prison .
i &apos;m not going after anyone .
i love my wife .
i love my children .
but your wife is leading her toward a divorce .
she &apos;s carla &apos;s divorce lawyer .
okay .
so , now we want the gloves to come off ?
i didn &apos;t know they weren &apos;t .
so you &apos;ve got me in general population
because my wife is your wife &apos;s attorney ?
hey , glenn .
you wanted the prize .
you wanted the office .
so enjoy the spoils .
i swear to tell the truth , the whole truth ,
and nothing but the truth . so help me god .
mr. roscoe , on your show of august 15,
did you say , &quot; jamie willens was never seen
&quot; on the convenience store video
because her mother killed her earlier that night . &quot;
you have the transcript right there in your hand ,
mr. gardner .
i do , don &apos;t i ?
there you are .
yes , to the best of my memory , mr. gardner ,
i said the words you just there quoted .
and this was on the same program
you accused the president of the united states of being a terrorist .
objection , your honor .
the answer is yes .
the answer to what is yes ?
yes , that &apos;s the same program
where i called the president of the united state , a terrorist .
and yes , emily ,
i can see there are black people on the jury .
thank you , mr. roscoe .
so , to the best of your knowledge ,
do the chicago police consider mrs. willens a suspect
in the disappearance of her daughter ?
isn &apos;t the pc term &quot; person of interest &quot; ?
let me just keep this real simple for you .
knock once for yes .
twice for no .
isn &apos;t anyone going to object ?
okay , actually , i don &apos;t want anyone knocking in my court .
now , mr. roscoe ,
when you publicly accused cheryl willens of murder ,
what evidence did you have that the prosecutors didn &apos;t ?
the prosecutor has to convince the jury .
i &apos;m a commentator . i only have to convince myself .
and so once you convince yourself , it &apos;s a fact ?
yes .
look .
i rely on the police records . i also have other sources .
how else would i know that cheryl willens
tried to get a third trimester abortion ?
what other sources ?
what ?
you just said you have other sources .
what other sources ?
objection ,
your honor .
under the shield law of illinois ,
reporters do not have to reveal their sources .
but , your honor , mr. roscoe just said
he &apos;s a commentator , not a reporter .
i don &apos;t care what he said .
mr. roscoe is a journalist .
we respectfully ask the court to compel mr. roscoe
to reveal what other information he received
about cheryl willens and where he got it .
you &apos;re asking me to pierce the shield law , miss lockhart ?
your honor , u.s. irve lewis &quot; scooter &quot; libby .
the court ordered new york times reporter judith miller
to reveal her sources .
i never thought i &apos;d see the day
when you would side with bush and cheney , counselor .
it is an established precedent , your honor . that is all .
bizarre .
mr. roscoe has managed to outmaneuver you on the left .
i guess i &apos;m overruling you , counselors .
mr. roscoe , you may keep your sources confidential .
thank you .
it &apos;s not true .
cheryl never tried to get an abortion .
ever .
is it possible , tim ...
and please excuse me for asking the question
because i know we &apos;ve really bonded over these last few days .
is it possible cheryl kept it from you ?
no . don &apos;t you see ?
now you &apos;re buying into duke &apos;s lies , too .
we just want to trace the source of the story .
we need to show that duke was being reckless with the truth .
is there any truth to it ?
look , i took her to her clinic visits myself .
all right , i would have known if she tried to get a late @-@ term abortion .
or any kind of abortion .
which clinic ?
i love you , carla .
can &apos;t we work this out without all these people ?
david and alicia are my attorneys .
how many divorces have you handled , mrs. florrick ?
actually , this is my first one .
then i should carefully explain
that when a wife signs a prenuptial agreement ,
she has forfeited her ability ...
alicia , you &apos;re probably wondering how glenn found out
about amber madison .
carla !
i don &apos;t want him to talk anymore .
ma &apos;am , that &apos;s not for you to determine .
shut up .
good .
now , i want you to drop the prenuptial agreement ,
and negotiate a fair settlement .
it is a fair settlement .
so , on glenn &apos;s computer , there &apos;s a file devoted exclusively to peter .
okay , okay . 20 % of my assets ?
i keep the house .
and something called triton fields .
carla , this ... this is illegal
what are you going to do ,
arrest the mother of your children ?
okay to the house .
full custody .
i need time .
12 hours . and then alicia and i will sit down
and have a nice , long chat .
i &apos;m so sure that cheryl willens killed her daughter
that i am now offering $ 100,000 from my own pocket ...
he &apos;s influencing the jury .
you don &apos;t think one or two of them are watching this ?
... to anybody who has even a shred of evidence
that jamie willens is still alive .
it &apos;s called the truth , folks .
look at stern , lockhart and gardner .
oh , here we go .
that &apos;s what our citizen journalists have been doing .
they &apos;ve been looking .
who has spent the last two months in detox ?
who has cheated on their tax return ?
who &apos;s a closeted lesbian ?
so , tune in tomorrow
and we &apos;ll find out exactly who has trouble facing the truth .
yeah , i remember cheryl .
good girl . so sad what happened .
you did say you &apos;re working with tim willens ?
yeah , he wants to clear her name .
so , when did she last come in ?
march &apos; 07 , her third trimester .
her third ?
was that a regular exam ?
cheryl was spotting .
nothing unusual ,
but the poor girl was so afraid of losing her baby
that she didn &apos;t even tell tim about it .
do you know of anyone here
who &apos;d say she was having a late @-@ term abortion ?
no .
what about others ?
cleaning crew , volunteers ,
garbageman ?
thank you so much .
what can i get for you ?
irene reagan ?
i &apos;m with juvenile courts and probation .
what did i do ?
oh , we &apos;re just following up on your time in community services
at the guardian family planning clinic .
well , that was over two years ago .
i thought my probation ended .
yeah. yeah , look ,
i &apos;m sorry to bother you about this at work .
we tried you at your home ,
and i wasn &apos;t sure if you had the same e @-@ mail address .
still reaganrules ?
yes . why ? what do you want ?
i want to know why you made up lies about cheryl willens .
this is crazy , peter . they need to put you back .
daniel &apos;s working on it .
childs moved you ?
yeah .
i think i know why .
his wife , carla childs ,
i &apos;m representing her . she &apos;s divorcing him .
i know .
he was here .
childs was here ? he told you ?
uh @-@ huh .
then i need to drop this .
no. he &apos;d have done it either way .
i &apos;m the threat to him , not you .
what is triton fields ?
what ?
carla mentioned it . she told me i should tell you .
it &apos;s a development .
the owner was charged with bribing people in my office .
childs was the prosecutor .
what else did she say ?
just that he had a file on his computer , that &apos;s all .
you think she &apos;d tell you anything else ?
counselor .
counselor ?
so , we holding grudges ?
not that i know of .
because my tattoo misses you .
let me think on it .
ouch .
nope .
no ouch .
i just want to think on it .
okay .
think fast .
would you consider yourself
a fan of duke roscoe , ms. reagan ?
yes .
watch his show regularly ?
been to his web site ?
sometimes .
on duke roscoe &apos;s blog ,
there are 83 entries from reaganrules .
is that you ?
uh @-@ huh .
and you would call 83 entries &quot; sometimes &quot; ?
did you also e @-@ mail with duke roscoe ?
i tried a couple times .
did you e @-@ mail him information that cheryl willens tried to obtain
a late @-@ term abortion at the clinic where you worked ?
ms. reagan ,
do you know what perjury is ?
yeah , i e @-@ mailed him about it .
was it true ?
no .
did duke roscoe contact you to verify your information ?
no .
anyone from his network call you ?
no .
and you were surprised that mr. roscoe used
your information on the air to accuse cheryl willens .
why ?
i @-@ i wrote him to say i made it up .
come on !
what am i , responsible for every e @-@ mail sent to me ?
mr. roscoe , please .
reclaim your seat .
why did you do it , irene ?
why would you make up something so hurtful ?
i wanted to hear from him .
to be part of it all .
i mean , he &apos;s duke roscoe .
&quot; dissolution of marriage . &quot;
it sounds so final , like a death certificate .
take your time , look it over .
your husband already signed .
you can change your mind .
as we discussed , your husband set aside
your prenuptial agreement and acceded to your terms .
in exchange , he has included a strict confidentiality clause
so anything i know about his work ...
you are prohibited from sharing with anyone .
after i sign this .
that &apos;s right .
then before i do ,
last year , glenn wiretapped your phones .
what ?
i saw the recordings on his computer . that &apos;s all i know .
there .
done .
thanks , man . i &apos;m fine .
yeah ?
who ?
okay .
never heard of that .
putting on no witnesses .
does that mean they give up ?
no , i &apos;m afraid they &apos;re counting on winning
solely on duke &apos;s right of free speech .
could you give me a second ?
what ?
there was a response to duke &apos;s reward .
what reward ?
for information on jamie .
that was the police in scranton .
they think they have a child matching jamie &apos;s description .
oh , my god .
was a childless couple
who supposedly saw her in a shopping cart and snatched her .
one of their neighbors phoned it in for the reward .
i ...
do you want to tell him ?
yes .
how you holding up ?
okay .
listen , i just got a call
from the scranton police department .
you ready for some good news ?
they think they got your girl , man .
is she okay ?
i think so .
it looks real good .
thank you .
i just received the verdict ,
and i find myself making a very difficult decision .
while i hold the defendant &apos;s behavior abhorrent
and callous , there is no greater bedrock
to our society than the first amendment .
without it , all our other rights are at risk .
and i must admit , i have found the plaintiff &apos;s case to the jury
to play on their passions in this matter ,
not their rationality .
uh ... mr. roscoe receives thousands of e @-@ mails every day .
so it is not axiomatically true that he would have seen this e @-@ mail
from ms. reagan , invalidating her story .
without that certainty ,
i cannot allow a jury under my purview
to subvert the first amendment .
so i am , therefore , directing a verdict in favor of the defense .
tell tim we &apos;ll appeal .
something tells me he &apos;s not gonna want to .
maybe next time .
i &apos;d like that .
neighbors credit publicity from the recent trial
as the reason for calling the police .
jamie willens &apos; picture had appeared in local news reports
over the last few weeks ,
and her image had been plastered all over the internet .
this stuff &apos;s awful .
it &apos;s too sweet .
and yet , i can &apos;t stop eating it .
pass me the remote .
... quoted as saying that he never doubted
he would see his little girl again .
the family has asked ...
before we move on from this sordid episode ,
there is a bit of unfinished business to deal with .
he &apos;s gonna be insufferable , isn &apos;t he ?
yep .
the promised secrets .
who spent two months in a michigan rehab ?
stern , lockhart equity partner
r.j. daniels .
who was caught cheating on his 2007 income taxes ?
jason michaels in acquisitions .
and last but not least , who &apos;s the closeted lesbian working at the firm ?
that &apos;s none other than
