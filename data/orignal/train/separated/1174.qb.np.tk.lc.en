i just can &apos;t ever picture alison wearing this .
well , picture vivian darkbloom .
they offered me the job .
what &apos;d you say ?
my dad , is he your father too ?
who told you ?
it &apos;s really none of your business where he is .
oh , it &apos;s my business .
i just didn &apos;t know that until recently .
ezra &apos;s taking that job in new orleans .
what job ?
the job that dad set him up with .
i want to understand what this is .
what &apos;s wrong ?
it &apos;s spencer .
before you and she got together , she was seeing someone else .
he &apos;s back now .
if you &apos;re not gonna give me any answers ,
i &apos;m gonna have to go looking for them myself .
give me your phone . hanna !
vivian ?
well , he recognized the coat ,
but when he saw it first ,
he thought it was alison-- vivian .
when we noticed you didn &apos;t come back , he was gone .
he was cute from the back .
so was his front ,
under different circumstances .
he &apos;s been in florida for , like , a year .
what did you tell him exactly ?
uh , i told him that i was a friend of vivian &apos;s
and that i hadn &apos;t seen her since she gave me the coat .
can i see that number again ?
yeah .
thanks .
duncan albert ?
he said he met her in brookhaven ?
yeah , in a bookstore .
couple places down from that creepy doll hospital .
well , whoever duncan is , he &apos;s connected to alison
and what she wanted in brookhaven .
how do we know that he wasn &apos;t just some guy
she flirted with in a bookstore ?
i don &apos;t think alison wasted vivian on flirting .
when she put that wig on , she wanted something .
she was looking for &quot; a. &quot;
duncan was part of that trail .
i &apos;ll call him .
aria , you don &apos;t have to .
any one of us could &apos;ve been wearing that coat .
but it was me .
she had the operation .
spence ?
i &apos;m not being unreasonable , i &apos;m being a mother .
no , you &apos;re cutting me off from the world .
i &apos;m not the one who ruined your phone , you are .
and since you were okay about doing that ,
i guess that means you don &apos;t need a replacement .
i can &apos;t go around without a phone .
it &apos;s like going around without a brain , or shoes .
phone is a privilege , not a right .
suppose there was an emergency .
i &apos;m sure emily would let you use your phone in an emergency .
sure .
i mean , well , yeah .
okay , no .
emily and i only have one class together .
i need my own phone .
today is about what i need .
i need to know more about what &apos;s going on in my daughter &apos;s life .
when you decide to talk about that ,
we can discuss a new phone .
i &apos;ll see you both at dinner .
it &apos;s really old , like six months .
but it works pretty good for an antique .
the number bills to my account .
your mom never has to know .
oh . mona , you are a life saver .
well , what &apos;s the point of doing something for someone
if it doesn &apos;t make you look good ?
i &apos;m already number one on the speed dial . ciao !
if only we could harness mona &apos;s sense of entitlement ,
we could light the eastern seaboard .
yeah , well , i don &apos;t care .
i got a new phone and didn &apos;t have to go through caleb .
he &apos;s safe in montecito .
did you get through to duncan yet ?
yeah , he &apos;s coming after school .
i &apos;m gonna meet him in the courtyard .
that sounds safe .
yeah .
later .
bye .
hello .
hello .
you &apos;re back .
and-- uh , obviously , you &apos;re back .
you are .
yeah , we &apos;re back .
are you okay ?
fine .
uh , jenna &apos;s eye . she got the surgery .
yeah , she did .
just the one eye ?
they do it in one eye at a time .
how did it go ?
well , we don &apos;t know yet .
i was a little surprised to see you guys together .
why ?
i don &apos;t know .
yes , i do , actually .
you went through so much to get away from her ,
and now you &apos;re back to just guiding her around .
not for much longer .
besides , she &apos;s my sister .
step @-@ sister .
she &apos;s been through a lot .
worse than any of us .
that &apos;s coming to an end .
better get used to that idea .
toby ...
i &apos;ve been thinking a lot about us .
it &apos;s a little late for that , isn &apos;t it ?
toby ? i &apos;m ready to go .
spencer , is that you ?
yeah .
i thought so .
so , were you looking for vivian in brookhaven ?
can i ask you a question first ?
sure .
is aria your real name ?
what ? yes .
of course it is . why would you ask that ?
because vivian &apos;s real name wasn &apos;t vivian .
and if you &apos;re her friend , you &apos;ll know her real name .
alison .
we have a winner .
so where is she ?
duncan ...
alison &apos;s dead .
i &apos;m-- i &apos;m sorry .
she disappeared labor day weekend year before last .
disappeared ?
what happened ?
look , i-- maybe--
what happened to her ?
she was killed and ...
they didn &apos;t find her body for a year .
do they know who did it ?
no .
the cops must have some ideas .
yeah , we-- we don &apos;t really trust the cops .
who &apos;s we ?
me and some of alison &apos;s friends .
you &apos;re the one who kept the journals .
the writer .
she talked about you .
there are four of you , right ?
she talked about us ?
yes .
she talked about you guys a lot .
did she ever ...
talk about anyone else ?
someone that she might &apos;ve been afraid of ?
look , maybe we shouldn &apos;t be talking about this here .
did you only meet her in that bookstore ?
no .
no , we spent a lot of time together at that summer .
in brookhaven ?
near brookhaven .
well , i-- i could meet you there .
i &apos;ll call you .
the weekend you said she disappeared ...
i saw her that weekend .
duncan saw ali that weekend ?
are we sure we believe him ?
he was all torn up when told him she was dead .
he couldn &apos;t have been faking that ..
em , you ok ?
sure .
why is garre in such hurry ?
where there &apos;s smoke , there &apos;s payback .
wait , what &apos;t&apos;going on ?
i don &apos;t know .
what are they talking to the fire department about ?
they &apos;re talking about that night .
the jenna thing .
are you serious ?
what could toby be telling them ?
i did such a good job of screwing him up ,
he might say anything jenna wants him to say .
that we were the ones who blinded jenna ?
alison and us .
remember that old movie about the blind lady got her sight back ?
i don &apos;t remember .
she filled her room with all the beautiful things she owned
so she could see them when she opened her eyes .
i &apos;m gonna do that .
before they take the bandages off ,
i &apos;m gonna fill my room with the things that i love .
you &apos;ll be there too .
that woman in the movie was a mean old bitch .
i thought you said you don &apos;t remember .
i hope you didn &apos;t take that cast off by yourself .
i was out of town . i saw another doctor .
well , don &apos;t favor it . did they give you exercises ?
yes .
good .
i &apos;m jenna , toby &apos;s sister .
hi , jenna . i &apos;m dr. kingston .
i helped your brother when he had his accident .
i remember .
does spencer know you &apos;re back ?
yes .
nice meeting you , jenna .
thank you for looking after my brother .
glad to be of service .
so that &apos;s spencer &apos;s personal physician ?
that &apos;s him .
i bet even a lie would sound good in that accent .
you okay ?
i don &apos;t know .
you thinking about toby ?
is it my fault ? did i make that happen ?
you broke off with him to keep him safe .
yeah , i wanted him safe ,
and he ended up back with jenna .
it &apos;s like out of the frying pan and into the volcano .
i made you help .
what are friends for ?
have you heard from your dad ?
he emailed me on a layover in germany .
are you okay ?
you never get used to it if that &apos;s what you mean .
my mom &apos;s gonna be back here next week .
have maya &apos;s parent &apos;s heard from her ?
no , they haven &apos;t .
i have .
what ?
yeah , she &apos;s all right .
where is she ?
she hasn &apos;t told me yet .
are you gonna tell her parents ?
she asked me not to .
but i keep thinking how my parents would feel
if i was missing .
you know , i don &apos;t know .
better go .
spencer . emily .
hey , i &apos;m so sorry that i haven &apos;t called you back .
my reserves have been really depleted , and--
this isn &apos;t about--
um , i &apos;ve got some of alison &apos;s things .
i &apos;ve been through them ,
but , i &apos;m not really sure what to do with them .
what kind of things ?
they &apos;re in a bag that was left
in the house when we moved out .
your friend maya said her family found them .
she said that they packed up
some of ali &apos;s things by accident .
maya dropped them off at the house .
maya did ? did you talk to her ?
the bag was on the porch .
and then i saw in the paper maya was missing .
is that true ?
yeah .
so the bag has ali &apos;s stuff in it ?
yeah , some of the things from her room .
i just thought you guys might wanna have a look .
yeah ?
can i interrupt ?
yes . come in .
i could offer you chocolate milk or an apple .
thank you , but no .
i was thinking about
the conversation we had in your apartment .
yes .
i &apos;ve never had a conversation like that before .
neither have i.
so , i wanted to make sure
i didn &apos;t leave you with the wrong impression .
just because i wanna talk about this
does not make me an ally .
i know , compared to my husband &apos;s attitude ,
it may look that way .
but i &apos;m not .
the only person i care about here is my daughter .
so you-- you want me gone too .
out of sight , out of mind .
that &apos;s what byron is thinking .
that &apos;s why he engineered that job offer for you ,
but i don &apos;t really have an opinion on that .
yes , you do .
yes , i do .
ella ...
it does actually matter what you think of me .
has aria ever mentioned someone bullying her ?
um , bullying is not the right word .
do you know of anyone who would
use this situation to hurt her ?
not-- her , not intentionally .
what about you ?
is there someone who would want to hurt you intentionally ?
there might &apos;ve been ,
but not anymore .
frankly , i &apos;d love to take that cane
and whack her like a pinata .
mona !
just kidding , sort of .
but she poached noel kahn right out from under me .
and she did that blind .
what &apos;s jenna gonna be like if she gets to see again ?
i can &apos;t even think about it .
spencer is lucky to be finished with toby
and the house of creeps .
okay , she is still hurting here .
look , spencer &apos;s really smart .
she said some things to me when
noel was slicing up my heart , that really helped .
i get that they &apos;re broken up , but you shouldn &apos;t hate her .
i just wish there was a way
to get toby away from jenna for at least five minutes .
are we scheming ?
i think so .
goody .
thanks so much for meeting me here .
my schedule &apos;s just been really stacked .
are you sure you wouldn &apos;t want something a little easier to handle ?
oh , no , it &apos;s not for me .
i told you , it &apos;s for my cousin .
yeah . he &apos;s going through this really big rockabilly phase .
so , i told him i &apos;d keep an eye out
for appropriate transportation .
oh ! look , a cassette player .
how de @-@ classe .
your cousin &apos;s gonna have to find another truck .
just give me five minutes .
he &apos;s all yours .
we have to talk .
we &apos;ve got nothing to talk about .
i get how you &apos;re mad at spencer .
but you &apos;re so mad , you don &apos;t see what you &apos;re doing .
toby , you can not let jenna back into your life again .
what you need to do is shut up about my sister .
if you &apos;re doing this to hurt spencer--
you have no idea what i &apos;m doing ,
or why i &apos;m doing it .
okay , fine .
i don &apos;t know anything . but what about you ?
did you forget everything jenna did to you ?
no . did you forget what you did to her ?
maya said this was in the attic ,
like it was hidden .
have you looked inside ?
just enough to know it &apos;s alison &apos;s .
okay , so duncan just called back and he wants to talk .
is that alison &apos;s bag ?
yeah , that &apos;s it . come take a look .
i can &apos;t . i told duncan i &apos;d go meet him .
where ?
a place called hallow acres .
he said he used to go there with alison .
okay , just give us a call as soon as you can .
i will . promise .
hey , em . bye .
bye .
she had that when she was a kid .
if there &apos;s anything you guys find in here you wanna keep ,
take it .
should bring the bag back to the house when you &apos;re done .
okay .
if i &apos;m not there , just drop it on the back porch .
thank you , jason .
did he ask to come here ?
no . i invited him .
don &apos;t ever do that again .
we don &apos;t need to complicate things .
i &apos;m trying to un @-@ complicate them .
well , don &apos;t . leave it alone .
there &apos;s nothing for you to fix .
so , what ?
we &apos;re just supposed to go back
to the way it was before we all knew ?
further , if possible .
you &apos;re late .
yeah , it kinda took me a while to find you .
you and ali came here ?
on the days , i took her flying , yeah .
flying ! in a plane ?
usually .
you have , like , a license or something ?
not like a license , an actual license .
pilot since i was 16 .
so , you &apos;re ready ?
i &apos;m sorry . ready for what ?
to talk about alison .
i thought we &apos;d find something .
me too . i don &apos;t know why , but i did .
it &apos;s just stuff .
disconnected stuff .
how often did you take her flying ?
on and off that summer .
as often as i could .
can i ask you something else ?
was i in love with her ?
i could &apos;ve been ,
if somebody hadn &apos;t gotten in the way .
another boy ?
that &apos;s what i figured .
at least i had her all to myself up here .
it made her feel ... safe .
safe ?
yeah , nothing could get to her .
she had control .
do you wanna try it ?
do i wanna what ?
take the yoke .
no , thanks .
you wanna understand your friend ?
what she was looking for ?
take control .
all right , you got it ?
i got it .
how does it feel ?
i don &apos;t know .
she &apos;d sit in that seat ,
i could just see her face change .
no masks ,
nothing to hide from , or be afraid of .
they couldn &apos;t get to her .
who &apos;s they ?
maybe a stranger .
maybe some boy she knew .
maybe a friend .
keep it level .
okay , i-- i don &apos;t wanna do this anymore .
just a little bit longer .
i &apos;ve done some reading since we talked .
the papers said a man named ian thomas
confessed to killing alison before he committed suicide .
left a note and everything .
the note-- the note was fake .
we-- we don &apos;t think that he did it .
we think that he--
we think that he was trying to protect somebody .
look , alison called me from hilton head
sunday that labor day weekend .
she wanted me to fly her from south carolina
to a field outside philadelphia .
you flew her from hilton head ?
picked her up that morning .
she was different that day .
she figured something out .
wait , if ali was with you ,
she was in town six ,
seven hours before we thought she got there .
i got a message you wanted to talk to me ?
yes , i do .
i got another call from professor schaffer
about the associate dean position in new orleans .
he wants my decision .
oh , it &apos;s a choice assignment .
it is , and i &apos;m gonna call him in a few minutes .
but , i wanted to tell you first .
why me ?
well , because you were so instrumental in my being considered .
well , i wouldn &apos;t say instrumental .
i mean , i might &apos;ve mentioned your name .
it was very generous of you .
that &apos;s why i don &apos;t want there to be any misunderstanding
when i tell you that i &apos;m not taking the job .
well , i--
i think you &apos;re making a mistake .
possibly , but it &apos;s not the mistake you think i &apos;m making .
you need to reconsider this .
seriously reconsider it .
i know it is a spectacular job
that will put my career
years ahead of schedule .
but if i took it ,
i &apos;d never be completely sure why i took it .
and i don &apos;t want you to have that kind of power over me .
where do you get the nerve to talk to me this way ?
after what you &apos;ve done to my family ?
i &apos;m sorry about that .
well , i don &apos;t accept your apology .
you need to go .
for the sake of everyone involved ,
you should simply leave .
it &apos;s like this , byron .
you think i &apos;m the kind of man who would take this way out .
and i know i &apos;m not .
well , we could &apos;ve resolved this and moved on ,
but apparently , ego is going to get in the way .
whose ego are we talking about ?
aria , it &apos;s me .
call me when you can .
i love you .
maya : &quot; i &apos;m fine , don &apos;t worry .
i won &apos;t take chances , because i &apos;m not as brave as you think i am .
you are the brave one . &quot;
no , i &apos;m not .
&quot; you know what else i love about you ?
you know how to be still .
in the middle of everything ,
at a swim meet with all the craziness and pressure ,
i look at you and you &apos;re still .
i wish i could do that ,
but i &apos;m impatient .
i shouldn &apos;t have come back .
i should &apos;ve just left and we &apos;d always have had
that last night instead of this mess .
i guess goodbyes are the only perfect things we get .
don &apos;t tell my folks .
i &apos;ll talk to them when i &apos;m ready .
- maya . &quot;
is he coming back for that ?
no , i &apos;m taking it over .
don &apos;t go in the house .
just give it to him and come right back .
mom , we can &apos;t go on like this .
you have to deal with what &apos;s happened .
this is how i choose to deal with it .
by ignoring it ?
maybe it &apos;ll just go away ? that &apos;s not going to happen .
look , we each know little chunks of the truth
and we have to share what we know ,
otherwise this is all gonna come apart .
come apart . it &apos;s gonna blow apart .
do you think that that boy has this family &apos;s interests in mind ?
do you ?
that boy is my brother .
he &apos;s the one who wants to blow things up .
that &apos;s what they &apos;ve always wanted .
your father and i ,
we &apos;ve been the ones who have kept things together .
do not listen to jason .
did dad tell you that i thought he was being blackmailed ?
what &apos;d you say ?
yeah , jason found money .
ali had it .
and he thought it was because she knew that dad was his father ,
and she was blackmailing him that summer .
you talked to your father about this ?
yes .
and what did he say ?
he denied it . and i believed him .
and then i didn &apos;t believe him .
and then i looked in the checkbook ,
and i thought that it was true and he told me
that he used the money to pay for a detective .
a detective ?
yes , because he thought that meliss--
do you see ?
do you see how this all just spins and feeds on itself ?
mom ?
the detective wasn &apos;t your father &apos;s idea .
it was mine .
wait , so you wasn &apos;t there only to drop it off .
no , the house is dark ,
so i just left it on the back porch . and i came back here ,
and i found you , lurking in the hydrangeas .
okay , i was not lurking ,
i was just working up the nerve to tell you about toby .
did i mess it up even more ?
i don &apos;t see how that &apos;s humanly possible .
i guess there is nothing important in that bag ?
i don &apos;t know what we though we &apos;d find .
just a bunch of kid stuff .
man , times are tough .
michelle obama wore this same blouse two years ago .
wait , where did you get this ?
i was sitting on it .
the stuff in the bag was wrapped up in newspaper from july , 2009 .
so ?
so we thought maya &apos;s parents wrapped that stuff ,
but ali did , before she disappeared .
spence , look .
yeah , this one &apos;s highlighted too .
wait , hanna . go through the back yard
and that get that bag off jason &apos;s porch .
i &apos;m gonna call aria and emily .
did something just happen ?
we were looking in the bag for clues ,
but we should &apos;ve been looking at the whole bag as a clue .
you were trying to buy him off .
how did you think he would react ?
you sound very close to defending him .
i &apos;m not defending anyone , believe me .
but i don &apos;t know what you thought you were going to accomplish
by strong @-@ arming him .
strong @-@ arming ?
a dream job with housing ?
that &apos;s what you call strong @-@ arming ?
you should &apos;ve known what he was gonna do .
when i talked to him--
wha-- ?
wait , you talked to ezra ?
yes , i did .
it is possible to communicate
with something other than threats .
so he was getting mixed signals from us .
this family invented mixed signals .
well , he &apos;s talked to schaffer by now and turned him down .
it &apos;s out of my hands .
what is out of your hands ?
i know how you feel about the way i &apos;m handling this situation .
yeah , it &apos;s complicated .
well , maybe we &apos;re making it complicated ,
when the answer is really simple
and right in front of us .
it will not be so simple if she runs away or elopes .
i don &apos;t want aria with him any more than you do ,
but if you back him into a corner ,
nobody will end up happy .
jenna !
hanna ! hanna !
you okay ?
fine , just get her down .
i got it .
toby ?
i &apos;m here .
a hospital ?
you &apos;re okay .
was there a fire ?
do you remember where you were ?
um , i-- i got a text .
i listened . it was from jason .
he said he had to talk to me .
you were gone , so i took a cab .
i rang the doorbell , someone opened it , and ...
that &apos;s all i can remember .
did jason &apos;s house catch on fire ?
yes .
i woke up in that place .
and-- and i couldn &apos;t see .
and there was smoke in my throat .
how did i get out , toby ?
did jason get me out ?
no .
it was hanna marin who got you out .
wait , so he flew her on a plane ?
from hilton head to an airstrip outside philadelphia .
what about the bus ride from her grandmother &apos;s ?
we never actually saw her get off the bus .
we only saw her get out of the cab .
she could &apos;ve been in rosewood hours before that .
doing what ?
hanna !
what happened ? are you all right ?
no , i &apos;m fine , i just need to wash my hair .
i &apos;m all smoky .
did you get this in the fire ?
there was something that i needed on the porch .
and there was glass .
well , you &apos;re not gonna need stitches .
so , i just clean this up , put a dressing on it ,
and send you home with some antibiotics .
thank you .
how &apos;s melissa ?
um , she &apos;s in philadelphia .
oh . i see that the carpenter is back .
and his sister .
she &apos;s not what i was expecting .
what was she doing in that house by herself ?
i don &apos;t know .
spencer , i hate to break this to you ,
but you have a very complicated life .
is that your medical opinion ?
yes . yes , it is , actually .
well , the condition is hereditary ,
so there &apos;s really not much i can do about it , i &apos;m afraid .
all right , well , don &apos;t be so certain of that ,
&apos;cause modern medicine &apos;s made great advances in this field .
you have to agree ,
fate keeps shoving us into the same path .
don &apos;t confuse fate with just ...
really bad luck .
as much as i hate to do this ,
i have to ask you a direct question .
do you want to agree that certain things
between us never happened ?
no .
i wouldn &apos;t take back anything .
what was jenna doing in my house ?
don &apos;t you know ?
no . i was halfway to scranton
then i got a call from the police saying there had been a fire .
how bad was it ?
first floor is pretty much damaged in the back ,
but i won &apos;t really know much else till morning .
i &apos;m so sorry .
i should probably go talk to spencer &apos;s mom .
mrs. st. germain . it &apos;s emily .
i wanted to talk to you about maya .
i know you &apos;re worried and i think she &apos;s okay .
no , but i heard from her .
i got an email .
spencer , jenna wants to talk to you .
all of you .
okay .
are you all right ?
i think so .
jason was miles away when the police called him .
he didn &apos;t send you that text .
somebody did .
any one of us .
you can &apos;t blame this on us .
i don &apos;t .
you should go .
wait .
hanna , are you there ?
i &apos;m here .
toby said that you were the one that dragged me out .
is that right ?
yeah . that was me .
why ?
you &apos;re welcome .
there all from that summer .
there &apos;s gotta be some kind of key .
we &apos;re the key .
ali said we know more about what happened than we think we do .
who tricked jenna into that house ?
if it was anybody but jenna , i think it &apos;d be &quot; a. &quot;
garrett can &apos;t be happy that toby &apos;s back in that house with jenna .
she was supposed to die in there , wasn &apos;t she ?
that &apos;s everything .
no , it &apos;s not .
does anybody recognize this ?
is there anything on the back ?
yeah , number 1 .
it &apos;s just half a postcard .
how do we find out where it &apos;s from ?
yeah , where &apos;s the other half ?
wait , this isn &apos;t from july , it &apos;s from the end of august .
look .
it &apos;s-- it &apos;s labor day events from philadelphia , brookhaven and ...
rosewood .
when did duncan say he left ali at the airfield ?
before noon on sunday .
well , is this where she was when we thought she was on that bus ?
