i am going to the arctic circle
with leonard , walowitz , and koothrappali .
for three months ?
yes .
what did you mean when you said you were going to miss me ?
it means i wish you weren &apos;t going .
oh , thank god we &apos;re home .
i can &apos;t believe we spent three months in that frozen hell .
it was like a snowy nightmare
from which there was no awakening .
i don &apos;t know what arctic expedition you guys were on ,
but i thought it was a hoot and a half .
oh , hi , mom .
no , i told you i &apos;d call you when i got home .
i &apos;m not home yet .
all right , i &apos;m home .
the arctic expedition was a remarkable success .
i &apos;m all but certain there &apos;s a nobel prize in my future .
actually , i shouldn &apos;t say that .
i &apos;m entirely certain .
no , mother , i could not feel
your church group praying for my safty .
the fact that i &apos;m home safe does not prove that it worked .
the logic is post hoc ergo propter hoc .
no , i &apos;m not sassing you in eskimo talk .
i &apos;m gonna go let penny know we &apos;re back .
mother , i have to go .
yeah , love you . bye .
hello , old friend .
daddy &apos;s home .
leonard , you &apos;re back .
yeah . i just stopped by to say-- hmph !
yeah . so , hi .
hi .
damn it , i should have gone over and told her we were back .
yeah , it was first @-@ come , first @-@ serve .
i just want you both to know ,
when i publish my findings ,
i won &apos;t forget your contributions .
great .
thanks .
of course , i can &apos;t mention you in my nobel acceptance speech ,
but when i get around to writing my memoirs ,
you can expect a very effusive footnote
and perhaps a signed copy .
we have to tell him .
tell me what ?
damn his vulcan hearing .
you fellows are planning a party for me , aren &apos;t you ?
okay , sheldon , sit down .
if there &apos;s going to be a theme i should let you know
that i don &apos;t care for luau , toga or &quot; under the sea . &quot;
yeah , we &apos;ll keep that in mind . look ...
we need to talk to you about something that happened at the north pole .
if this is about the night the heat went out ,
there &apos;s nothing to be embarrassed about .
it &apos;s not about that .
and we agreed never speak of it again .
so we slept together naked .
it was only to keep our core body temperatures from plummeting .
he &apos;s speaking about it .
for me , it was a bonding moment .
sheldon , you remember the first few weeks
we were looking for magnetic monopoles
and not finding anything and you were acting
like an obnoxious , giant dictator ?
thought we were going to be gentle with him .
that &apos;s why i added the &quot; tator . &quot;
and then when we finally got our first positive data ,
you were so happy .
oh , yes .
in the world of emoticons , i was colon , capital &quot; d. &quot;
well , in actuality , what your equipment detected
wasn &apos;t so much evidence of paradigm @-@ shifting monopoles
as it was ...
static from the electric can opener
we were turning on and off .
he just went colon , capital &quot; o. &quot;
you tampered with my experiment ?
we had to .
it was the only way to keep you
from being such a huge dickensian .
you see that ? i add the &quot; ensian . &quot;
did leonard know abouthis ?
leonard &apos;s my best friend in the world .
surely leonard didn &apos;t know .
actually , it was his idea .
of course it was . the whole plan weeks of leonard .
i missed you so much .
i missed you , too
i couldn &apos;t even think of anyone else while you were gone .
me , neither .
except for one night when the heat went out .
long story . it &apos;s ... don &apos;t ask .
leonard .
do not make a sound .
whispering , &quot; do not make a sound ... &quot;
... is a sound .
damn his vulcan hearing .
not a good time , sheldon .
penny .
penny . penny .
oh , this is ridicules .
what ?
hello , penny
i realize you &apos;re currently at the mercy
of your primitive biological urges ,
but as you have an entire lifetime
of poor decisions ahead of you , may i interrupt this one ?
it &apos;s great to see you too . come on in .
wolowitz has informed me of your grand deception .
do you have anything to say for yourself ?
yes , i feel terrible about it .
i will never forgive myself , i don &apos;t expect you to , either ,
and i would really appreciate it if you would leave me with penny
for a session of self @-@ criticism and repentance .
okay , can someone please tell me what &apos;s going on here ?
what &apos;s going on is i was lead to believe
i was making groundbreaking strides in science ,
when in fact , i was being fed
false data at the hands of wolowitz , koothrappali
and your furry little boy toy .
is that true ?
it was the only way to make him happy .
well , why &apos;d you have to make him happy ?
because when he wasn &apos;t happy , we wanted to kill him .
there was even a plan .
we were going to throw his kindle outside ,
and when he went to get it , lock the door
and let him freeze to death .
that seems like a bit of an overreaction .
no , the overreaction was the plan to tie your limbs
to four different sled dog teams and yell , &quot; mush . &quot;
look , we kept the original data .
you can still publish the actual results .
yes , but the actual results are unsuccessful
and i &apos;ve already sent an e @-@ mail to everyone at the university
explaining that i have confirmed string theory
and forever changed man &apos;s understanding of the universe .
aw , see , yeah , you probably shouldn &apos;t have done that .
so write another e @-@ mail . set the record straight .
it &apos;s no big deal .
you &apos;re right , leonard .
it &apos;s not a big deal .
all you did was lie to me , destroy my dream
and humiliate me in front of the whole university .
that , fyi , was sarcasm .
i , in fact , believe it is a big deal .
oh , the poor thing .
yeah , i feel terrible .
wait wait , aren &apos;t you going to go talk to him ?
what ? uh , he &apos;ll be fine .
the guy &apos;s a trooper . come here .
no , you &apos;re right-- you shouldn &apos;t talk to him .
i will .
man , i cannot catch a break .
do you want to talk ?
about what ?
being betrayed by my friends ?
spending three months at the north pole for nothing ?
and i didn &apos;t even get to go to comic @-@ con !
oh , hon ...
uh ...
soft kitty , warm kitty ...
that &apos;s for when i &apos;m sick . sad is not sick .
oh . sorry .
i don &apos;t know your sad song .
i don &apos;t have a sad song . i &apos;m not a child .
well , you know , i do understand what you &apos;re going through .
really ?
did you just have the nobel prize in waitressing
stolen from you ?
well , no , but when i was a senior in high school ,
one of my friends heard
i was going to be named head cheerleader .
oh , i was so excited .
my mom even made me a celebration pie .
then they named stupid valerie mosbacher head cheerleader .
big old slutbag .
are you saying
that you think a &quot; celebtion pie &quot;
is even remotely comparable to a nobel prize ?
well , they &apos;re pretty tasty .
and on a different , but not unrelated topic ,
based on your current efforts to buoy my spirits ,
do you truly believe that you were ever fit
to be a cheer leader ?
look , sheldon , i just don &apos;t think
that the guys and leonard really meant to hurt you .
you know ? they just told an unfortunate lie
to deal with a difficult situation .
okay , you know what it &apos;s like ?
remember that scene in the new star trek movie
when kirk has to take over the ship ,
so he tells spock all that stuff he knew wasn &apos;t true ,
like saying spock didn &apos;t care his mom died ?
i missed comic- con and the new star trek movie !
i like the new look .
thanks .
i call it &quot; the clooney . &quot;
i call it &quot; the mario and luigi but whatever .
hey , how &apos;s sheldon doing ?
well , he came out of his room this morning
wearing his darth vader helmet and
trying to chop me to death with the &quot; force &quot;
so i would say &quot; a little better . &quot;
if i may abruptly change the subject ,
did you and penny finally ... you know .
howard ...
personally , i don &apos;t care ,
but my genitals wanted me to ask .
well tell your genitals
what i do with penny is none of their business .
he says they didn &apos;t do it .
sheldon , over here .
what are you doing ?
well , i feel bad for the guy .
sheldon , why are you sitting by yourself ?
because i am without friends .
like the proverbial cheese , i stand alone .
evenhile seated .
come on . we said we we sorry .
it &apos;s going to take more than an &quot; i &apos;m sorry &quot;
and a store @-@ bought apology pie from penny
to make up for what you &apos;ve done to me .
hey , cooper .
read your retraction email .
way to destroy your reputation .
you see ?
people have been pointing and laughing at me all morning .
that &apos;s not true .
people have been pointing and laughing at you your whole life .
all right , i &apos;ve had enough .
attention , everyone .
i &apos;m dr. sheldon cooper .
as many of you in the physics department might know ,
my career trajectory has taken a minor detour .
off a cliff .
my credibility may have been damaged
completely wrecked .
but i would like to remind you that in science ,
there &apos;s no such thing as failure .
there once was a man who was referred to his prediction
of a cosmological constant as the single &quot; biggest blunder &quot;
of his career . that man &apos;s name was--
surprise , surprise--
albert einstein .
yeah , but research into dark energy
proved that einstein &apos;s cosmological constant
was actually right all along , so you &apos;re still--
surprise , surprise--
a loser .
oh , you think you &apos;re so clever .
well , let me just tell you ,
while i do not currently have a scathing retort ,
you check your e @-@ mail periodically for a doozy .
so much for our friendship with sheldon .
well , we always have the night the heat went out .
hi .
hey .
listen , since we got , you know , interrupted last night ,
i didn &apos;t have a chance to give you this .
oh , leonard , you shouldn &apos;t have .
oh , boy !
what is it ?
it &apos;s a snowflake .
from the north pole .
are you serious ?
uh @-@ huh .
it &apos;ll last forever .
i preserved in a one percent solution of polyvinyl acetal resin .
oh , my god .
that &apos;s the most romantic thing anyone &apos;s ever said to me
that i didn &apos;t understand .
it &apos;s actually a pretty simple process .
you see , cyanoacrylates are monomers which polymerize on--
red alert , leonard . sheldon ran away .
man , i cannot catch a break .
so , how do you know he ran way ?
well , he &apos;s not answering his phone ,
he handed in his resignation at the university
and he sent me a text that said , &quot; i &apos;m running away . &quot;
okay , well , thanks for letting me know .
well , leonard , aren &apos;t you going to do something ?
of course i &apos;m going to do something .
uh , howard , you check the comic book
raj , go to the thai restaurant .
i &apos;ll stay here with penny in her apartment .
oh , damn it
it &apos;s sheldon &apos;s mother .
a break cannot be caught .
hi , mrs. cooper .
he is ?
sheldon went home to texas
yeah , no , i know he resigned .
yes ... i guess it is kind of our fault .
no , no , no . you @-@ you &apos;re right . someone needs to come talk to him .
don &apos;t worry , i &apos;ll take care of it .
yeah . all right .
new plan .
howard , you and raj go to texas .
i &apos;ll stay here with penny in her apartment .
well , you &apos;re not gonna go with them ?
well , you know , i gave you the snowflake
and we were kissing and ...
oh , come on , i don &apos;t want to go to texas !
oh , right , and i do ?
my people already crossed a desert once .
we &apos;re done .
trust me , you &apos;ll be fine . see ya .
well , wait a second , leonard , come on ,
how can you not go ? he &apos;s your best friend .
yeah , but i already saw him naked .
i promise i will be he when you get back .
just go help sheldon .
really ?
yeah . we waited a few months . we can wait a few more days .
maybe you can .
go .
boy , you cannot catch a break , can you ?
here you go , shelly.- thaks , mom .
hold your horses , young man .
here in texas , we pray before we eat.- aw , mom .
this is not california , land of the heathen .
gimme .
by his hand we are all ...
... fed .
give us , lord , our daily ...
... bread .
please know that we are truly ...
... grateful .
for every cup and every ...
... plateful . amen .
now , that wasn &apos;t so hard , was it ?
my objection was based on considerations
other than difficulty .
whatever . jesus still loves you .
thank you for carving a smiley face in my grilled cheese sandwich .
oh , i know how to take care of my baby .
his eyes cames out a little thin ,
but you can just pretend he &apos;s chinese .
do you want to talk about what happened with you and your little friends ?
they &apos;re not my friends .
all right .
if you recall , when you were little ,
we sat right here at this very spot
we talked about some of the problems
that you had get in along with the neighbor kids .
that was different .
they were threatened by my intelligence
and too stupid to know that &apos;s why they hated me .
oh baby , they knew very well why they hate you .
i can &apos;t believe you bought a red cowboy hat .
hello ? i &apos;m wearing a red turtleneck
plus , it was the only boys &apos; large they had .
i &apos;m sorry , this does not look like texas .
where &apos;s the tumbleweeds ? whe &apos;s the saloons ?
saloons ?
yeah , like in the movies i saw growing up in india .
you know , uh , four for texas , yellow rose of texes .
this neighborhood is more liketexas chainsaw
i was really hoping to see a cattle drive .
what can i tell you ?
they probably have steaks on sale at that big @-@ ass costco over there .
will you please take that stupid hat off ?
no , i want to blend in .
to what ? toy story ?
hi , boys .
howdy , ma &apos;am .
howdy to you too.you got here quick ..
we took the red @-@ eye .
well , come on in .
thank you kindly .
can .. can i get you something to drink ?
uh , no , thank you .
if you don &apos;t mind , i got a hankerin &apos; for a lone star beer .
there &apos;s no alcohol in this household .
stop talking like that and lose the hat .
sorry , i &apos;ll take a diet yoo @-@ hoo if you have it .
you &apos;ll take a coke .
what about you ? radge , isn &apos;t it ?
oh , you still having trouble talking to the ladies ?
because , you know , at our church ,
we have a woman who &apos;s an amazing healer .
mostly she does , uh , crutch and wheelchair people ,
but i bet she &apos;d be willing to take a shot
at whatever third world demon is running around inside of you .
uh , if you don &apos;t mind , mrs. cooper ,
there &apos;s a 3 : 05 nonstop back to los angele
and you have no idea how much i want to be on it .
a girl ?
uh , yes , ma &apos;am .
oh , good . i been praying for you .
oh , sheldon .
what are they doing here ?
we came to apologize .
again .
and bring you home .
so , why don &apos;t you pack up your stuff and we &apos;ll head back
no , this is my home now .
thanks to you , my career is over
and i will spend the rest of my life here in texas
trying to teach evolution to creationists .
you watch your mouth , shelly .
everyone &apos;s entitled to their opinion .
evolution isn &apos;t an opinion , it &apos;s fact .
and that is your opinion .
i forgive you . let &apos;s go home .
don &apos;t tell me prey doesn &apos;t work .
how about that.i finally caught a break .
you know how they say when friends have sex , it can get weird ?
sure .
why does it have to get weird ?
i don &apos;t know .
i mean , we were friends , and now we &apos;re more than friends .
we &apos;re whatever &quot; this &quot; is .
but why label it , right ?
i mean , it is what it is and ...
leonard ?
yeah ?
