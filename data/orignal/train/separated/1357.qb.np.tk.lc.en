i &apos;m done .
got it . you can release the scene .
okay .
good night , susie .
i have been sitting on prison point bridge all morning .
literally sitting .
what moron closes a lane in the middle of rush hour ? !
there &apos;s coffee .
oh , thank god .
what ? are you researching cia torture treatments ?
close . medi @-@ peutic -- it &apos;s a day spa .
this treatment utilizes
high @-@ frequency electropulse therapy .
people actually pay money for that ?
oh , you don &apos;t want to know how much .
give me a battery and some jumper cables .
i &apos;ll do it for ya .
i have a gift certificate for one treatment .
one ? oh , how ever will you decide ?
i don &apos;t know . it &apos;s proving quite difficult .
how about a reparative oxygen and caviar plunge ?
it &apos;s fish eggs .
do you really need to know more ?
okay , fine . there are plenty of other options .
i think you should come with me , and we &apos;ll make a day of it .
mm @-@ hmm . can &apos;t wait .
oh . i think i just found the perfect treatment for you .
i bet you 5 bucks you &apos;re wrong .
vino rejuvenation using the free radicals and antioxidants
found in grapevines ,
and each treatment comes with wine .
how much wine ?
rizzoli .
your very own bottle .
isles .
do you get the wine before the treatment ?
yep .
you win .
okay , i &apos;ll make a deal with you .
i &apos;ll go to this medi spa -- whatever it &apos;s called --
if you go to a patriots game with me .
that hardly seems like a fair trade @-@ off .
i know , but i &apos;m willing to suffer through a massage
because i &apos;m a giver .
you really called out the cavalry for this one .
can i speak to you ?
maura , could you give us a second ?
sergeant korsak ?
why would two medical examiners be called in on the same case ?
that &apos;s a waste of resources .
maura , um ...
what &apos;s going on ?
i &apos;m so sorry .
it &apos;s susie .
what ?
what happened ?
i don &apos;t know . um , i @-@ i &apos;ll go upstairs and find out .
why don &apos;t you have a uniform take you home , okay ?
no , i &apos;ll be fine .
i , uh ...
never knew she &apos;d been skydiving .
she asked me to join her .
now i wish i had .
you okay ?
not really .
around 8 : 00 a.m. this morning ,
a neighbor noticed the front door standing open .
they came in , found the body , called 911 .
there was no sign of forced entry .
well , they were looking for something .
yeah . but her purse is still here .
it &apos;s got her credit cards , keys .
and her car is still parked in the garage .
security cameras ?
outside the garage and at the front door .
they show her car entering around 11 : 26 p.m.
but nobody suspicious entered
at either the front or the back entrance around that time .
they might &apos;ve already been waiting inside .
all right , let &apos;s get her back .
one moment .
dr. isles , i @-@ i &apos;m sorry . i @-@ i would &apos;ve waited . just --
it &apos;s okay .
findings ?
time of death was approximately
somewhere between midnight and 1 : 00 a.m.
cause appears to be blunt @-@ force trauma to the back of the head .
the victim shows no --
&quot; susie . &quot;
sorry -- what ?
her name -- susie .
i see no apparent signs of a struggle ,
no signs of bruising ,
or any other marks to susie &apos;s body .
so it appears that she never saw it coming .
let &apos;s hope not .
we &apos;ll find who did this , maura .
no forced entry , no signs of struggle ,
and she was attacked from behind .
you think susie knew her killer ? maybe she let him in .
well , what the hell were they looking for ?
jane . you need to see this .
all of this was hidden in the wall ?
yeah , along with this .
shit !
little over 5 grand .
what was susie doing with evidence ?
that &apos;s a good question .
wait . you &apos;re kidding me , right ?
there &apos;s no way susie was dirty .
i didn &apos;t know her for very long .
but she seemed ...
well , she ... seemed very competent .
she was -- exceedingly .
in afghanistan , i lost a lot of colleagues .
i &apos;m sorry .
i know how hard this is .
as susie &apos;s employer and friend ,
i have an obligation to recuse myself from the autopsy .
but i &apos;d like to see the results as soon as possible .
of course .
we have to treat this like any other case .
dig into susie &apos;s life and figure out
who had a reason to hurt her .
you mean find proof she was doing something illegal .
but she wasn &apos;t .
frankie , if you need to step aside on this ,
no one will think any less of you .
no , i &apos;m fine .
no , seriously .
if you have to ...
i &apos;m fine .
well , i talked to a couple of lab techs .
they don &apos;t think she had a boyfriend .
they didn &apos;t know about any threats .
and none of the neighbors reported anybody suspicious
hanging around over the last few days .
no arguments , nothing out of the ordinary .
anything on the cellphone ?
nothing that stands out .
friends and family mostly , a few work @-@ related calls .
i also ran her bank records .
no big purchases or unusual deposits .
so we got nothing .
except ...
this .
it &apos;s hard to imagine susie taking bribes
in exchange for altering evidence .
if she was , maybe her killer was searching
for a piece of evidence she &apos;d taken .
maybe they didn &apos;t want to pay a bribe .
maybe they were looking for a more permanent solution .
we need to match all these to the cases they came from .
that &apos;d be like finding a needle in a haystack .
hundreds of pieces of evidence
come through the crime lab every week .
then we need to talk to the one person who knows
what goes on down there better than anyone .
that &apos;s ridiculous .
at this point , it &apos;s just one avenue of investigation .
well , it &apos;s a waste of time .
susie chang was one of the most principled people
i &apos;ve ever known .
she would never tamper with evidence .
maybe you could just take a look at the stuff we found ,
see if you recognize any of it .
without labels , it &apos;s impossible to say .
these could &apos;ve come from anywhere .
but they didn &apos;t . they came from susie &apos;s apartment .
okay .
i will have the lab test them for dna or prints .
maybe we can find a match to an existing case .
thank you .
could you also give us a list of cases
susie worked in recent weeks ?
of course .
but first , i need to call governor holcomb .
what for ?
because this changes everything .
i mean , even a hint that a senior criminalist
in the medical examiner &apos;s office
was tampering with evidence is incendiary .
the press is gonna have a field day .
the press isn &apos;t gonna find out about it --
not until we have proof .
a scandal like this could jeopardize every case
that has passed through this lab over the last few years --
potentially thousands of cases .
she &apos;s right .
maura , come on . at least give us a couple of days .
i cannot risk
the governor hearing this from anybody else .
yes , uh , governor holcomb , please .
this is dr. maura isles .
it &apos;s important . i &apos;ll hold .
i got that address .
want to ride out together ?
yeah . sure .
what address ?
susie was working a crime scene the night she was killed .
we &apos;re gonna check it out .
nina and i will go over susie &apos;s recent cases ,
see if anything jumps out .
okay .
the right is from cash found at the crime scene .
the left from senior criminalist chang &apos;s personnel file .
an exact match .
hardly surprised , though .
i mean , it was found in her apartment , right ?
yes , but i was hoping this would prove
that somebody else put it there .
whoever -- whoever ... killed her
could easily have put her prints onto the cash .
of course .
but conjecture won &apos;t help us . we need proof .
and until we have it , we have to be very careful .
the medical examiner &apos;s office is gonna be under a microscope .
how can i help ?
i need you to take the lead on this .
everything has to be transparent .
all procedures and tests
according to the strictest guidelines .
i was susie &apos;s direct supervisor ,
so we have to avoid any suggestion
that i am trying to affect the outcome of this investigation .
what if you don &apos;t like what i find ?
just find the truth .
i am confident that that will exonerate susie .
so , susie &apos;s last case was a homicide .
the vic was stabbed
and bled out before the paramedics arrived .
the body was over by that dumpster .
what are we doing here ?
susie was killed 6 miles from this place .
susie died one hour after she left this crime scene .
that gives her just enough time
to drop the evidence off at bpd and then drive home .
you think she was followed ?
well ... even if she was guilty , susie was smart .
she wouldn &apos;t want a criminal to know where she lived .
i mean , she had to have been followed from somewhere .
but there was no sign of forced entry .
a @-@ and she never would &apos;ve let someone in she didn &apos;t trust .
no .
and there was no record of a call to set up a meeting .
well , unless she had a burner and they took that , too .
janie , i @-@ i don &apos;t want to believe that she was crooked .
nobody does .
we don &apos;t have all the facts yet .
i know , but how many times
have we seen good people do bad things ?
come on .
poor thing .
this is unbelievable .
it &apos;s just terrible .
jane , come on . you can clear this up .
you know susie didn &apos;t do those things .
it &apos;s complicated , ma .
you worked right next to her every day .
don &apos;t you think you would &apos;ve known ?
i do .
of course you would &apos;ve .
she was your friend .
there &apos;s lots of stuff we don &apos;t know about our friends .
even you ?
there &apos;s a couple things you don &apos;t know about me .
well , i could tell you a few things .
yes , and i could tell you a few things
about this one , too .
it &apos;s not possible
that we could &apos;ve been so wrong about susie , is it ?
look , you two haven &apos;t had time to grieve .
instead , you &apos;ve been working this case .
you should be thinking about
all the things you did know about her ,
like what was her favorite food ?
mint chocolate chip ice cream .
she kept a pint in the lab freezer .
ice cream and lab tissues do not mix .
well , did she have a pet ?
fluffy -- lizard .
fluffy passed away two months ago .
don &apos;t ask .
well , what did she prefer -- socks or no socks ?
who cares ?
exactly .
you can know someone
without knowing every little detail about them .
did you trust her ?
definitely .
absolutely .
it &apos;s governor holcomb .
this is maura isles .
did you ever tell maura about the junior prom disaster
with benjy schwartz ?
no .
and you &apos;re not going to , either .
and if you do , i &apos;ll tell her about
your new year &apos;s eve 1999 fiasco .
you wouldn &apos;t .
yes , i would .
no .
i &apos;d make stuff up , too .
no , governor , i completely understand .
okay . goodbye .
what &apos;d he want ?
the governor is concerned about the fallout
from a scandal at the medical examiner &apos;s office .
he &apos;s hoping to get ahead of it
before the media gets ahold of the story .
therefore , effective immediately ,
i am suspended from duty .
you gave a full report of our investigation
to the governor &apos;s office ?
yeah .
they requested it last night , and i sent it over .
maura got suspended because of that report .
i was doing my job -- by the book , as requested .
now , did you need something ?
yeah , i needed the autopsy results ,
and you haven &apos;t even started .
so , what -- so maura puts you on an investigation ,
now you &apos;re out to get her job ?
that &apos;s brilliant , detective . you got me .
here .
what is that ?
the autopsy report that you requested .
2 : 37 a.m.
so , what ? you were here all night ?
yeah .
plotting my overthrow of dr. isles .
and going through the lab &apos;s recent cases
to find if any of them are missing any key evidence .
what &apos;d you find ?
well , it &apos;s what i didn &apos;t find that &apos;s interesting .
not one case -- susie &apos;s or otherwise --
in the last six months is missing any of the evidence
that you found in susie &apos;s apartment .
well , then , where did it come from ?
i &apos;m afraid that &apos;s your job , detective .
now , the autopsy did confirm that susie died
from a massive blow to the back of the head .
something -- something heavy ,
like a @-@ a metal pipe or a tire iron .
i found some metal alloy in the cranial avulsions --
i &apos;m sorry .
just tell me .
i also found some odd lividity patterns --
subtle fluctuations in how the blood settled .
i think the body may have been compressed after death
for approximately an hour .
compressed how ?
well , wrapped up --
in a @-@ a tarp or plastic sheet of some kind .
wait a minute . are you saying that you think the body was moved ?
definite possibility .
okay , this is good .
um ... sorry about the whole &quot; you taking maura &apos;s job &quot; thing .
i &apos;m sorry -- what was that ? i couldn &apos;t quite hear you .
okay , you know what ?
so , if the killer transported the body here ,
they could &apos;ve planted the cash and evidence we found .
yeah , but they &apos;d have to get the body inside
without any of the neighbors noticing .
didn &apos;t you say that the garage footage was really dark , right ?
yeah .
all right .
what if susie wasn &apos;t actually driving her car ?
you think she was moved in her own vehicle ?
i mean , you can see a driver , but you can &apos;t see who it is .
well , there &apos;s a back stairway down here .
they could &apos;ve taken her up that way .
around midnight , when none of the neighbors would notice ?
well , if you &apos;re right ,
the killer would &apos;ve left on foot .
he would have wanted to ditch whatever he wrapped susie in
right away so close .
okay , i &apos;ll have csru come and process her car .
yeah .
hey ! stop ! stop that truck !
h @-@ hey ! wait !
boston police department !
how many trucks are working this area ?
three ?
well , get on the radio , tell them all to stop .
this whole area is a crime scene now .
which one are you supposed to be -- starsky or hutch ?
did you find something ?
no . but we &apos;re really close .
maura , listen .
no .
you don &apos;t even know what i &apos;m gonna say yet .
jane , you &apos;re gonna ask me to look at something
to do with susie &apos;s case , and i can &apos;t --
not until she &apos;s officially cleared of any wrongdoing .
maura , you know this suspension is ridiculous .
you don &apos;t think i want to help ?
jane , i can &apos;t risk it .
the reputation of the medical examiner &apos;s office
has to be above reproach .
what are you doing ,
just sitting around the house doing nothing ?
i am not sitting .
all right , well , find something to do , okay ? stay busy .
you and i do not do well on the sidelines .
i &apos;ll call you later .
not until the governor lifts the suspension .
i know ! i know . god .
jane .
csru found a plastic tarp in a dumpster
a couple of blocks from susie &apos;s apartment .
are they sure it &apos;s connected to the case ?
there was dried blood and hair inside .
kent &apos;s processing the dna now .
if susie was transported to the apartment ,
it probably means the whole crime scene was staged .
somebody &apos;s going to a lot of trouble
to make susie look dirty .
the lab confirmed that the dna on the plastic tarp was a match .
susie was definitely moved .
i knew she wasn &apos;t dirty .
well , the killer wanted everybody to think she was .
we cross @-@ indexed all susie &apos;s cases
with her e @-@ mails , phone calls , and lab requests
and then narrowed it down to all the ones
most likely to have been involved with her murder .
all right , everybody grab a stack .
we &apos;ll go through them individually .
so , kent discovered additional fibers
inside the plastic lining ?
a couple .
and these chemicals that kent found on the fibers --
does he have any theories on where they came from ?
well , he &apos;s working on it .
i &apos;ll just ... hang on to this for a while .
you can &apos;t give it to maura . she asked us to stay away .
i know .
jane .
i &apos;m not going to give it to maura .
i promise .
maura ?
m @-@ maura ! maura !
honey , what &apos;s going on here ?
oh , well , i am taking jane &apos;s advice .
i &apos;m keeping busy .
i &apos;ve been meaning to do a deep cleaning for months .
oh , you &apos;re very thorough .
did you hear the latest about susie ?
no .
yeah , jane found proof that she didn &apos;t do anything illegal .
susie &apos;s clear .
ohh ! i am so relieved .
me too .
so , now you can go back to work , right ?
well , we &apos;re gonna have to wait
for the governor to lift the suspension .
we can &apos;t afford anyone thinking that susie &apos;s innocence
was somehow manufactured in order to avoid a scandal .
all right .
but , um ...
now that i &apos;m here , maybe , um ...
maybe you could help me with something ?
what do you think of , um ...
yeah --
uh , pr @-@ pro ... pi ... on ... aldehyde ?
i &apos;m sorry ?
or , uh , methylanth @-@ th @-@ thracenes ?
anything weird about those ...
jane sent you .
jane ? no .
she wouldn &apos;t do that .
maybe you could help me pick that up ,
and , um , i &apos;ll finish the vacuuming .
trivalent chromium .
what ? !
angela , you have to tell jane --
wait , wait , wait !
what ?
you have to tell jane to have the lab test
the trivalent chromium particles for azurite .
also , see if they can detect heightened levels of
alicyclic c10 hydrocarbons .
maybe you could just write that down ?
um , i @-@ i heard you were a half @-@ caff caramel macchiato man .
you didn &apos;t spit in it , did you ?
do i look like someone that would be that immatu--
please don &apos;t answer that .
can you tell me about the fibers you found on the plastic sheet ?
pigskin .
due to the presence of trivalent chromium particles ,
i would say it was from a leather product .
susie wasn &apos;t wearing leather .
you think the fibers could &apos;ve transferred from her killer ?
possibly .
pigskin is used to make leather jackets and gloves .
but i couldn &apos;t confirm it .
there were traces of smoke residue also .
could you , uh ... run a couple of tests for me ?
and what tests would these be ?
uh , check them for ...
... azurite and alicyclic c10 hydrocarbons ?
why ?
&apos;cause i said &quot; please . &quot;
you do know you didn &apos;t say &quot; please &quot; ?
please .
fine .
thanks a lot .
just as a matter of curiosity ,
what does this murder have to do with a painting ?
who said anything about a painting ?
well , azurite is primarily used for blue pigment ,
and those hydrocarbons are predominantly found in paint thinners .
did you say that you found smoke residue ?
it was in the report .
i need you to run those tests now .
like , now now . please .
here &apos;s something -- rape case coming up for appeal next month .
susie just completed the report
on new dna evidence being used by the prosecution .
that &apos;s interesting . let me see .
forget about all those .
where is susie &apos;s file on the -- the painting forger ?
charlie ganz ?
yes .
charlie ganz murdered that art thief
and then killed himself -- that case is closed .
not officially . susie was still making calls about it .
i think she ordered some new tests , too .
who did she call ?
let me check .
kent found smoke residue on those fibers ,
and they have the same chemical components
as this burned painting .
the thomas moran painting ?
yes .
but the forger is the one who torched it
right before he killed himself .
we thought he torched it .
you think whoever burned that painting also killed susie ?
yeah , and it wasn &apos;t charlie ganz ,
&apos;cause he was already dead .
susie made three calls about this case
in the week before she died --
the huntington museum ,
mary hope langdon , the owner of the painting ,
and a dr. kowalski at the bcu art @-@ history department .
okay , let &apos;s -- let &apos;s call all of them
and see what she wanted to talk about .
susie was chasing a theory on this case .
yeah , and it &apos;s that theory that got her killed .
the forger and the thief were both dead .
everything wrapped up , neat and tidy .
but actually , there was a third person involved .
i &apos;ll run all their known associates ,
see if anybody pops up .
that was dr. kowalski ,
the art @-@ history professor at bcu .
he said susie contacted him because he specializes
in the hudson river school of painters .
she wanted to know what kind of wood
moran used to stretch his canvases ,
which was mostly alder , but --
jane .
i brought dinner ... like we planned .
right .
you got any extra ? &apos; cause i &apos;m starving .
sorry . no .
jane .
right .
i hope this is something good .
i knew better than anyone how susie thought ,
how she processed things .
so i downloaded all of her work from the lab servers ,
trying to figure out what she was doing .
nice .
she was focused on the fire
that destroyed the thomas moran painting .
focused how ?
she sent everything recovered at the scene
back for additional analysis --
the metal backing wire , a small piece of the frame ,
all of the ashes .
did she find anything ?
traces of methylene chloride .
which is ... ?
methylene chloride is used to strip the paint off of old canvases .
wait a minute .
so ... the painting in the fireplace was stripped ?
by a chemical that &apos;s only been around since the mid @-@ 1900s .
so the masterpiece in the fire ...
is simply another forgery .
maybe it was a practice version of the one we found in the museum .
well , then , everything has been staged --
the burning of the painting , susie &apos;s death .
what do you want to bet that charlie ganz &apos;s suicide
wasn &apos;t real , either ?
so somebody is tying up loose ends
with only one purpose in mind .
yeah , so that no one knows
this $ 20 million painting still exists .
okay .
but how would the killer know
that the m.e. &apos; s office was still investing this ?
all of these files are confidential .
susie made a few calls last week .
so she may have tipped them off .
yeah . our killer is probably someone that she spoke to .
thank you , maura .
detectives korsak and rizzoli to see secretary and mrs. langdon .
open the gate . bpd is here .
where did the wife &apos;s family get all her money ?
her family invented clothespins .
you &apos;re messing with me .
what , you think they invented themselves ?
thank you , sandra .
i haven &apos;t talked to anyone from the police department --
not since i spoke with the two of you .
this would &apos;ve been a woman
from the medical examiner &apos;s office -- susie chang .
her records show a two @-@ minute call
to your number four days ago .
oh . this is the house line , not my cell .
i didn &apos;t take this call . did you ?
no . anyone on the staff could &apos;ve answered that .
i @-@ i &apos;m sorry . what exactly is it that you &apos;re hoping to discover here ?
well , we need to speak to whoever took that phone call .
why ?
with all due respect , secretary langdon ,
we &apos;re investigating a homicide , so right now ,
we &apos;re the ones asking the questions .
this susie chang -- she was the same woman
who was taking bribes , is she not ?
actually , no . she wasn &apos;t .
and that information hasn &apos;t been made public ,
so how do you know about it ?
governor holcomb told me ,
and , frankly , i was outraged ,
as every citizen in massachusetts should be .
sam .
no , mary .
this is exactly the kind of corruption that we need to root out .
it &apos;s about time somebody held these agencies
to a higher standard .
sam , please . you &apos;re not on the campaign trail .
thank god .
detective , what do you need from us ?
we need to talk to everyone on staff
who might &apos;ve answered that call .
fine .
sandra , can you gather everyone , please ?
can you excuse me ? i need to take this .
jane , i just heard from agent burns at the fbi .
he says the guy who wanted to purchase the moran painting
got contacted about buying it three days ago .
our killer &apos;s trying to unload it .
did they get any information on the seller ?
no names , but the seller did give the buyer a contact number .
i ran the number .
it goes to a prepaid cellphone , but it &apos;s not gps @-@ enabled .
so they can &apos;t get a location on it .
not exact , but there were a few pings off
cell towers around boston , so he &apos;s somewhere local .
frankie , do me a favor .
call that number .
now ?
yeah , now .
it &apos;s ringing .
i got him .
get on your knees ! put your hands behind your head !
now !
i want a lawyer .
doesn &apos;t look too shaken up , does he ?
smug bastard .
turn off the cameras and give me 10 minutes alone with him ,
he &apos;ll be shaken up .
we &apos;ll get him .
we don &apos;t have enough to put him away , and he knows it .
nina &apos;s still digging .
she found an offshore account in his name .
it &apos;s got 100 grand in it .
you think he was paid to steal the painting ?
i do .
right now , all we &apos;ve got is the cellphone he was carrying .
it ties him to the buyer but not the victims .
frankie &apos;s back .
we &apos;ll get him .
did you find anything in ainsley &apos;s apartment ?
nothing -- no painting , no pigskin gloves ,
no possible murder weapon .
found something interesting .
kirk ainsley has worked for the langdons
for almost eight years , but in his 20s ,
he was an enlisted soldier in the army , rising to sergeant .
so he has the skills to have pulled this off .
but here &apos;s the interesting part .
guess who his commanding officer was .
who ?
captain samuel langdon .
so he &apos;s used to taking orders from langdon .
he owes him , too -- langdon pulled ainsley to safety
when an i.e.d. hit their squad in iraq .
he saved ainsley &apos;s life .
but that still doesn &apos;t explain
why langdon would steal his own painting .
he &apos;s got plenty of money .
no , no , no . he doesn &apos;t have the money -- the wife does .
has langdon filed papers to run for next year &apos;s governor &apos;s race ?
$ 20 million would make a nice campaign war chest .
and he could run the money through a pac .
no one would know where it came from .
langdon hasn &apos;t filed to run ,
but he did form an exploratory committee .
so langdon wants to be governor ,
兰登试探竞选 为竞选州长成立试探委员会
but his rich wife isn &apos;t thrilled about it .
maybe she won &apos;t bankroll him .
he recruits his old army buddy to help him steal a painting
his wife already owns .
we need to have another conversation with secretary langdon .
well , mary hope is usually right about these things .
detective rizzoli , i was just saying
that i owe you two a huge apology .
i &apos;m afraid that i let my enthusiasm
for improving our city get the best of me .
well , thank you very much .
i apologize if i was out of line ,
and i want to help this investigation
in any way that i can .
you can start by telling us about kirk ainsley .
yes , particularly the part about you being
his commanding officer in the army .
of course . yeah .
that &apos;s what makes this such a shock .
i &apos;ve known kirk for years ,
and i never , ever would &apos;ve thought
that he &apos;d be capable of doing something like this .
except that --
well , he may have murdered three people .
you need to tell us whatever you know .
ainsley was a good soldier .
but he came back from iraq ...
changed .
honestly , i &apos;ve been worried about his mental health for a while now .
well , we can understand
how this would be difficult for you .
why don &apos;t you , uh ... why don &apos;t you have a seat ,
uh , while detective korsak takes your statement ,
and i &apos;ll grab us some coffees .
thank you .
oh , and , uh , detective ?
yeah ?
cream , two sugars .
of course .
get up . we &apos;re taking a walk .
i &apos;m not saying a word without a lawyer .
good . all you got to do is listen .
get up !
i know that langdon paid you off .
and i &apos;m sure he told you
he would take care of you no matter what ,
get you the best lawyer money could buy .
where is this lawyer ?
don &apos;t say a word .
move .
and over the last few years ,
ainsley &apos;s become increasingly unhinged .
and where was it , again , you said
he might &apos;ve hidden some evidence ?
he has a small cabin off upper mystic lake .
it &apos;s not registered in his name .
i think it &apos;s on old pine ridge road .
you son of a bitch .
ainsley ?
it was your idea ,
killing those people and planting that evidence .
what ? that &apos;s -- that &apos;s absurd . - what do you want to know ?
i &apos;ll give you enough to put this bastard away forever .
clearly he &apos;s insane .
oh , you lying sack of shit !
all right , all right .
all right , you want to do the honors ?
with pleasure . you have the right to remain silent .
anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law .
you have the right to an attorney .
dr. isles .
welcome back .
thank you .
and thank you for stepping up the last few days .
ah , i was just doing my job .
i hear they &apos;ve recovered mrs. langdon &apos;s painting .
yes .
but i doubt that she will ever look at it the same again .
anyway , good night .
oh , kent , uh , a few of us
are going to the dirty robber after work --
just a small celebration of susie &apos;s life .
why don &apos;t you come ?
yeah .
yeah , i &apos;d like that .
good .
kent ?
i think this is yours .
ah . i was wondering where that got to .
thanks .
uh , i &apos;ll see you shortly .
thank you all for coming .
we all know that susie loved a party .
i knew the moment that i met susie
that she was someone very special .
the second week she was at the lab ,
we had a corpse arrive -- 700 bee stings .
massive skin lesions , acute inflammation --
the point is , the next morning ,
i came in to find susie in the back ,
covered from head to toe in a beekeeper &apos;s suit ,
running tests on four different hives .
and i knew then that i had met a kindred spirit .
we will miss you .
to susie .
to susie !
in honor of one of our favorite science nerds ,
i asked nina to find something that susie liked .
were you able to find anything ?
this is susie &apos;s ipod --
the one she listened to when she was working in the lab .
isn &apos;t that against regulations ?
oh , have a drink .
shut up .
please continue .
well , there &apos;s one on here she played 468 times .
must &apos;ve been a brandenburg concerto .
there &apos;s nothing better to work to .
or to fall asleep at your desk to .
make me feel where you st--
you know the words ?
of course i do . don &apos;t you ? come on !
