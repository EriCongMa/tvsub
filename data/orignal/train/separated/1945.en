"One Flight Down"
A surgical residency
is all about training for the worst.
But as prepared as we might be,
we usually don't see disaster coming.
We can try to envision the worst-case scenario
to foresee catastrophe.
Kepner, where is everyone?
Anyone in particular?
Well, page everyone now. A plane went down.
A small one, but it crashed right in the middle of the city.
I didn't hear anything about --
There it is.
Let's move, people!
Hey.
Hi.
But when true disaster strikes, it often comes out of nowhere.
Amelia.
I just don't think this -- us -- is a good idea.
Mixing work and play.
Play?
Play? What am I now, some screw?
I didn't say that.
This is more.
Amelia, you and I both know this is more.
I don't have any more to give.
I'm not trying to hurt you.
I'm not hurt.
I get it.
And...
I'm done.
And when the worst really does happen...
Owen. - You don't want real. You want the -- the play.
You want the high. You want the rush.
And I'm not doing that. I'm not interested, so I'm done.
Amelia...
I've had enough.
We need to set up a central triage area.
Walking wounded can go to the ambulatory care center.
...we find ourselves completely blindsided.
Hi. You've reached Dr. Shepherd.
Please leave a message, and I will return your call.
Hey.
So, I just got off the phone with the white house,
and apparently you missed your meeting.
I don't know what's going on,
but you probably owe them
a phone call, I think.
Watch out! Coming through!
Slow down! What's your problem?
Sorry. There was a plane crash.
This is gonna be so good.
We are probably looking at piles of crush injuries, burns.
compound fractures.
If we're lucky.
Move it or lose it, ladies!
I need you to be still.
Wilson, I need a little help here.
Shut up! Shut up!
Derek!
Grey.
Grey, need a hand.
I flew a plane. I had the controls in my hands.
I don't know how to fly a plane, and I flew a freaking plane!
We were in a plane, and it crashed.
The plane crashed.
All I could see was freaking sky!
Are you the pilot?
No, no, sam.
Sam's the pilot. Where -- where is he?
Where -- where is Sam?
I don't know! I only have one shoe!
Oh, god, Sam.
Transfer her on my count. One, two, three.
I need a trauma panel, c-spine, chest, and pelvis.
Edwards, grab the ultrasound.
He had a heart attack or s-something.
Something happened to him, and I had to try.
I had to try to land the plane.
Visualize the paracolic gutter.
Um, what's your -- what's your name? - Kate.
Okay, Kate?
Yeah.
We're gonna find your husband,
but first we're gonna -- we're gonna take care of you.
Make sure you check for fluid in morrison's pouch.
He's not my husband.
It was a -- it was a date. - Smaller movements.
Uh, a first date from that site where you --
Where you put down what kind of date you want to go on.
And then you meet the person, and then you go do it.
What about that?
Yeah. Yeah, I see it.
We're almost done here.
I've -- I've been on a bunch of those dates,
and it's always bowling or something that sounds fun,
but then turns out to be dumb.
This guy -- this guy's, like, "Let's go up in my plane."
And I'm, like, "Why not?"
Grey, over here.
And it was -- was perfect.
He turned out to be nice and funny,
And we were up in the sky,
and I've never felt like that before.
Not even with guys I've been out with a bunch.
He's -- he's amazing. He's am--
Is he gonna be okay?
I just -- like, I don't want to lose him.
I just found him. I-I just found him.
Derek!
I heard your voice. I thought I was dreaming.
Grey? Grey?
Where are we at?
She's got free fluid in the belly.
We're gonna have to take her up to for a head C.T.
and get her to the O.R.
Page Shepherd. - Sam --
he's not dead, right?
Where is Derek?!
Please.
He can't die.
Have you seen Dr. Robbins?
No, I'm sorry.
Alex, where's Robbins?
I don't know. What do you need, a consult?
I need Robbins.
There -- there was a plane crash.
I know.
But we're okay.
'cause it's not us.
It's not us, so we're -- we're okay.
We are okay.
We are -- we are okay.
Did you see the guy out there?
His leg is severed beneath the knee.
Did you -- did you see him?
I did.
We're okay.
The girl, she can't find her boyfriend.
We're okay.
We're okay.
You're awake.
I am now.
Don't pretend staring at me like that isn't creepy because it is.
Is it sexy creepy or just --
How long have you been awake? It's -- it's still dark out.
A little while. Not too long.
Your snoring woke me up.
I don't snore anymore.
You know, in D.C.,
I could hear the metro station from my apartment.
The trains would wake me up every morning.
This is a much better way to wake up.
Yeah?
Your snoring is like a train.
It's much cuter.
I don't snore.
Yes, you do. It's like music.
It's like a birdsong.
A loud, gargling bird.
On a train.
They just keep coming. Is that the pilot?
Yeah, Sam Garrett, 36. BP's 90 PALP. Tachy at 120.
Probable abdominal injuries.
Then let's get him in.
Uh, have you seen, uh, Meredith or Arizona today?
They -- they okay? - No. I haven't.
There ought to be some rule
that people who have been in a plane crash can't work on one.
That's not a bad idea.
We should, uh, you know,
look out for them today, you know?
Yes.
Oh, uh, no.
No, um, I can't.
I mean, I want to, but I can't be that person for Arizona.
It's, uh -- it's not my place, you know.
Not anymore.
Right. Yeah. Okay.
Yeah.
I need tocolytics for bed 6.
One of the overflows needs a fetal monitor,
and I need you to call labor and delivery
and have them prep for a "C" that's heading their way.
Right away.
Oh, my g--
don't do that to people!
Sorry. You okay?
Are you kidding? Of course I'm not okay.
Well, I figured. Look --
A plane crashes into a whole prenatal yoga class?
I mean, what are the odds of that?
Wait. What?
We were just doing triangle pose,
and there was this crash,
and a car came right through the window.
It was terrifying.
Okay, um, moms one and two are possible labors.
Mom three is hypertensive.
Mom four is possible labor,
or she's freaking out.
Why wouldn't she be?
And mom five is a small abruption
that might require a section.
I mean --
Yeah, you don't really seem okay.
You need a hand?
No.
I'm just in the weeds here.
Yeah, you need a hand.
Kate...
She was so good. She was amazing.
Abdominal distension. Diffused tenderness.
He needs a scan and a cardio consult.
A guy has a heart attack, crashes his plane.
It's a miracle he's still talking.
It wasn't me. It was Kate. She was the miracle.
My chest felt like a load of bricks on it.
I couldn't move. She just took over.
I tried to talk her through the landing,
but...she was so brave.
She just did it.
Dr. Grey? Is this Sam?
This is Sam.
Kate won't stop talking about him. How is he?
Uh, you've seen her? Is she okay?
We're taking very good care of her. Don't you worry.
I'm gonna marry that girl.
Uh, I think the feeling's mutual.
That sounds crazy, but I will.
I'm gonna marry her.
Oh, his pressure's bottomed out.
We need to get him upstairs now.
Hang another unit on the infuser.
Tell me again.
He likes you.
One, two, three.
He gushed.
He said he was gonna marry you.
Oh, my god.
I know.
He has these pretty eyes where you can't tell
if they're green or hazel or blue or what,
but against the sky, they're blue.
And he was looking at me,
and he asked me if I was ready to fly.
And the next thing I know, we were up in the air.
He said flying is his favorite thing in the world,
and he's so excited, and he was so good at it.
Like, this is what he was born to do.
I fell. Right then.
I knew I was looking at the love of my life.
And we were flying,
and the air was underneath us and clouds all around us, and --
I mean, this doesn't happen, right?
First dates like this, guys like this?
Up until now, I would have said no.
But -- but then he started grabbing his chest,
and then we were falling out of the sky.
It's not fair.
It's not fair.
Hey. Heard you two caught the pilot.
Yeah, we did. Going in on him now.
You good? You okay?
I'm fine.
'Cause, you know, there was a plane crash,
and I just thought maybe --
for about a year after the crash,
Arizona had nightmares,
and if I'd come home even 10 minutes late, she'd freak out,
so I just wanted to see if you're doing okay.
Derek missed his meeting in D.C.,
and I haven't heard from him.
That's not weird.
Okay.
It's not like I should have heard from him. I --
We don't call each other every second.
We're not those people.
I'm a surgeon. I'm busy.
He's in D.C. He's busy.
So it's fine that I haven't heard from him.
It's not a thing.
It's the plane crash, Meredith.
The plane crash is making you worry.
I know. I know.
You'll call me if she --
Just call me.
For a while, I would facetime Cristina.
I would prop her up right there where your head is now.
Half the time, she was in surgery,
so I would just watch her operate until I drifted off.
I brought the kids in the bed for a while
so we could all sleep together.
I printed a tumor, and I slept with that there for a bit.
It's just weird. I...
That pillow's been empty for such a long time.
Not now. Not anymore.
I know.
I just wished you didn't have to go back to D.C. at all.
I wish you could just stay right here, right now.
It's my last trip, and then I'm back for good.
I promise.
I know.
I've missed you.
I missed us.
I have, too.
Okay, let's pack all four quadrants.
Can you feel the mesentery?
Grey.
Did you find the mesentery?
Oh, I was just -- sorry.
Dr. Grey, do you need to be replaced?
No. I'm fine.
No, you're not fine. You're distracted.
You and Derek went down in a plane.
You drowned. He got shot.
You gave birth in a power outage.
Is this supposed to make me feel better?
I'm just saying, you have every reason to be distracted,
every reason to think the sky is falling.
Do you need to go?
No!
Okay, well, how long can you go
without hearing from him before you absolutely go crazy?
I don't know. I-I -- 6:00, 6:30, maybe.
Okay, then, let's say 5:00.
At 5:00 P.M., if you haven't heard from him,
you can panic.
You can call the police, call the paramedics.
You can freak out until your little heart's content.
But not one minute before and not in this O.R.
Can you do that?
5:00 P.M.
5:00 P.M.
Yes.
Okay.
So, it's kind of an amazing story.
It was their first date, and they both --
Chief, in or out, please?
I just need to know if Kate is good to go to the O.R.
for abdominal surgery.
I'm looking.
Please look fast. I'm on a timeframe here.
I will not hold you up.
Because this lady will bleed out if I don't get her up there.
Yes, I am aware you are impatient.
I can't make it my problem.
Does the patient have a brain bleed or not?
She looks clear.
Edwards, take her up to O.R. 2.
Kind of amazing about these two, isn't it?
They meet for all of 20 minutes and just fall in love.
I'm not someone who believes in fate or anything like that,
but it kind of makes you wonder, doesn't it?
Or maybe not.
Maybe they're both crazy.
But even then, that's what my grandma used to say,
that that's what love is all about,
that everyone is crazy in their own way.
And the trick is finding someone
whose crazy complements your own.
Edwards, let's just work without all the talking.
Edwards, what?
Well, I have questions about the procedure.
You're supposed to allow me to ask questions,
and I'm supposed to learn.
I have a right to learn.
I'm not -- - instead, you're silencing me.
I've been silenced. It's unprofessional.
Just because you're having personal issues
with a co-worker, with a neurosurgeon,
it's not fair that you silence my voice.
Fine, fine! What is your question?
Well, when you glare at me like that, I can't remember it.
I actually felt it before I saw it.
Even small planes have that engine power, you know,
the kind that vibrates inside your chest.
Did it seem like something was wrong?
As soon as I looked up,
I immediately knew the descent was in trouble.
Th-the drag, th-the thrust, the angle.
Practically scraped my roof. I-I couldn't believe it.
Well, how close were you again?
Uh, I-I should, you know,
probably see how they're doing in the E.R.
Oh, I thought Torres was down here.
I need a consult.
Uh, no, she's in O.R. 6.
Hey, uh, are you working with Arizona today?
Is she doing okay?
Yeah, well, I mean, she keeps yelling at me to do crap,
so I guess that's normal.
Anyone know how Mer's doing?
Uh, they, um --
They had a bad experience on a plane a while back.
Oh. Yeah, I get that. I hate flying.
My flight out here from Boston was the worst.
There was some technical problem with the plane,
and so they left us on the tarmac for four hours.
And they wouldn't let anybody out their seats to use the bathroom.
They weren't serving water, and it was so hot.
It smelled like boiled feet.
And then!
After four hours, they just canceled the flight.
I mean, they just kicked us off.
There was no apology. There was no --
What?
You tell her.
Oh, okay. Um...
Here we go.
Looking good here. How are we doing there?
Looking good so far.
Let's unpack, check what we have.
Pressure's droping.
That doesn't make any sense. Oh, no.
There's no blood in the abdomen.
He's throwing PVC's.
And his pressure is still dropping.
He's going into cardiogenic shock from the heart attack.
He might be having a repeat m.I.
Get Pierce up here now.
Meredith's sister?
Yeah.
And that's how Arizona lost her leg.
I never wanted to ask.
Callie had to amputate.
She would have died if, uh, the leg didn't come off.
It would have killed her.
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.
Cutting the pericardium.
Suction.
Here.
Okay, good. That did it.
What are you doing?
Uh, acute M.I. Cardiac tamponade.
His ventricle ruptured.
You need to plug the hole.
I'm trying. I can't find it.
Suction.
Stick your hand in there.
There you are.
Gown me.
Don't move.
He's barely perfusing. Are you compressing hard enough?
I know how to compress a heart.
Watch my finger.
Okay, Grey, you'd do well to remember
who you talking to before you get smacked.
I need a patch, pledgets, and 3-0 prolene.
His tissue's pretty friable. You sure a patch will hold?
It has to.
In a perfect world, I'd put him on bypass
and stop his heart completely,
give myself plenty of time to make sure
that I am sewing up healthy tissue.
No. No bypass?
Well, we have to do a splenectomy
and a partial hepatectomy in order to salvage the liver.
If we put him on bypass, we'll have to heparinize him,
and he'll bleed out on the table.
I know.
There's nothing I like more than being painted into a corner.
That's the spirit. Let's be optimistic, shall we?
Okay.
Meredith, I'm gonna need you to lift your finger on my count.
One, two, three.
Ugh.
We managed to fix the intestinal tears
without having to resect the bowel.
You're actually pretty lucky.
With the kind of sudden impact you took,
It could have been a lot worse.
Yeah, oh, and just so you know, sam still is in surgery,
but he is in excellent hands,
and we will let you know as soon as we have more news.
S-sam?
Yeah, Sam, your date.
The pilot of the plane.
What plane?
Why do you -- you keep talking about a plane?
What happened to me?
Please, tell me what happened to me.
Temporary memory loss is very common in situations like this.
Oh, that's your assessment, that this is all just temporary?
It's my opinion and my hope.
But I will do a repeat C.T. And a neuro check every hour.
And you're sure you didn't miss anything in the first C.T.?
I didn't miss anything on the first C.T.
because there wasn't anything to see,
but she could have had a post-surgery stroke
or an evolving intracerebral contusion.
So you're saying this was my fault.
I'm saying this is no one's fault.
This kind of thing happens all the time.
Do the C.T. Let me know when you have the results.
Hey, mom four looks okay to me.
I think you can discharge her when you're done here.
Thanks.
Who do we got?
Uh, mom one, possible labor turned into definite labor.
Great. Need help?
No.
Um, no, yeah. Check on mom two.
I just started her on nifedipine.
Do what you got to do, but you keep that baby in there.
What?
Nothing.
Then go. Go. Go, go!
Okay, you may feel a little sting here,
but we are almost done, okay?
No, I could tell right away there was a problem.
The pitch, the -- the air speed, and I'm wondering,
where does this pilot think he's gonna land this bird?
But then it's too late.
The thing just roars right over my head
and crashed in the street right behind me.
Right behind you?
Hmm? Uh -- uh -- behind?
Yeah, well, a little back, a little beyond.
I mean, o-of course, we're moving in opposite directions.
Wow.
And then I'm racing to the E.R.
to prep it for the first casualties
and just thanking god I'm alive.
I mean, I knew that they were stranded out there,
but what they went through?
They gave Dr. Sloan a pericardiocentesis
with, like, a drinking straw.
They all almost died.
It was love at first sight. It's real, and they had it.
Who?
Kate and Sam, the plane-crash couple. Oh.
They had it, and now she can't remember any of it or him
or any of their amazing, unicorn-magical first date.
Did you know that it was Torres who sawed off Arizona's leg?
That's what happened?
Yes, and it's so weird because now we know them.
They're like real people, and they were in a plane crash.
Oh, oh, and Alex used to hook up with Grey's sister.
Pierce? She wasn't even here.
No, there was another one, Lexie.
Was?
She died out there in the woods.
Oh, my god. What if Sam dies?
What if Kate never remembers?
What if -- what if Shepherd made the wrong call
because she's so pissed at Hunt, and Hunt's so pissed at her,
and he dies, and Kate doesn't remember any of it?
Like, it never even happened?
Like poof, gone, just evaporated like it was nothing?
I can never look at any of them the same again.
Never.
Yeah, that woman is never gonna find this kind of love again.
Ever.
Hey, who is that? Where'd you get that baby?
It came flying out of mom two.
I told you to keep that baby in.
I tried. She didn't respond to the meds.
Little bugger apparently wanna out.
Wha-- how's his mom?
Oh, she's doing great. Easy delivery.
All right, I'll check on her after my section on mom five.
You need a hand with that?
No, I'm fine.
Well, I mean, it's not a problem if you want an assist.
No, I got it. - Well, no, I mean --
No, Alex!
Just get that baby settled in the nicu and this one, too.
Okay, last suture going in.
Okay. You can let go...
Now.
Damn it! Damn it.
It's not holding.
So much for optimism and joy.
What now?
I don't know.
Maybe there's a way we can put him on bypass after all.
Are you out of your mind?
No, but I am out of options.
Bypass isn't an option. You know that.
Do you have a better idea?
Yeah, don't do something that kills my patient.
Dr. Grey, this is our patient,
and you're having a bad day.
Pierce, you are a very smart woman.
There has to be something that we can do,
apart from bypass,
that doesn't involve sending this man home
with your hand in his chest.
So we are all going to be quiet and let you think,
and you are going to come up with something.
Cyanoacrylate.
Glue? You want to use glue to put the patch in?
What makes you think that's gonna hold
any better than the stitches did?
Bailey's infectious optimism.
You heard the woman -- cyanoacrylate.
Uh, we don't have any on hand.
Then go get some!
He's in fib.
What are you waiting for? Go get that glue now!
Move! Run!
Charge to 25. Clear.
Again. Clear.
Come on, come on, come on.
Come on, come on, come on.
Come on. Come on. Come on, come on. Ugh.
There he is. We got him back.
He barely has a pressure.
Where the hell is that glue?
It's coming. Any minute now.
Any minute.
I have the glue!
Optimism for the win.
All right, nurse, I need your finger back in here,
and I need another patch.
All right.
Let's try this again, shall we?
On my count.
Hands up and see if it holds.
One, two, three.
Pressure's...
...good.
Well...
Huh, that was fun.
Okay, great. Now tell me your name again.
Kate Shaw.
Good. Squeeze my finger.
What city are we in?
Seattle, Washington.
Very good, other hand.
Now, tell me who's the current U.S. President.
Unless it's changed in the last hour,
it is still Barack Obama.
Nice. Now, tell me about when you got on the plane.
I'm sorry.
No!
No. Sorry.
You...
You have to, okay?
Remember -- Sam.
Remember? You thought he was really cute.
I know, you keep saying that.
And you really liked him,
and he really, really liked you.
Why do you keep --
Because I think you're meant to be together, okay?
I don't -- - If you're not,
then what's the point of a plane crashing
and bringing the two of you here?
It's just -- - Stop it!
I don't know, okay? I don't know!
You keep telling me all of these things
that I'm supposed to know, and I don't know!
You're not helping!
This isn't helping.
Dr. Edwards
Edwards!
What the hell were you trying to do in there?
You do not push a patient like that.
I just -- I hoped that I could --
What, that you could badger her into remembering?
That is not how this works.
She was distressed enough already,
And you are only making it worse.
Dr. Shepherd, you can stop yelling
at my resident in the hallway.
Your resident? Your resident?
Yes, yes, today she's my resident.
Okay, I can yell at any resident I want to,
especially if she has been tormenting my patient.
It looks completely unprofessional.
You really want to argue about this?
Listen -- I do, actually, because you have been
totally unreasonable at every level.
And you are completely out of line.
Listen! Okay?
This story? It's all about me.
When I tell it, it's about me.
It's not about you or you
or the fact that you two are messed up
'cause you can't figure out how to date or hook up
or whatever it is that you're doing
that I just don't care about.
Me. I am the protagonist.
You don't interest me.
This story is about love and I will find it,
That he is out there, and that even if I crash a plane,
He is out there.
And it doesn't work unless she remembers,
and you're ruining it for me.
I am the hero.
Kate is the patient that I saved,
and you two -- you two are messing it up.
I'm -- I'm gonna --
I should --
Hey, oh, please don't tell me
you've birthed another one of my babies.
Oh, no, no.
all the yoga ladies are in repose.
Their word, not mine.
It's about time.
Is this the abruption?
Where do you want me?
Outside.
Oh, come on, let me help.
I don't need your help.
I need you to stop hovering.
I'm not hovering.
Yes, you are.
You're hovering and lurking and creeping.
Look, I'm just trying to help you.
No, Alex, you're not.
Meredith asked you to watch out for me
because she thinks I'm coming apart,
But I am not coming apart.
But you hovering doesn't make it any easier.
What would make it easier
is if you got out of my O.R. and let me do my job!
I'll do a T.E.E. on Sam later
to make sure that the repair holds.
Any word?
No.
5:00.
What's at 5:00?
Derek missed his meeting in D.C. this morning.
I called him, and he didn't pick up,
and I haven't heard from him all day.
5:00 is my deadline.
If there's no news, then I'm gonna go home and freak out.
You're freaking out now, though, aren't you?
Yeah.
Going over everything you can think of.
You're going back to the last conversation you had
and playing it over and over in your head
From beginning to end, right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's what I would do, too.
You should go home, Mer.
Zola wants a car. Did she tell you?
A car?
Yeah.
I asked her, "I'm gonna bring something back from D.C.,
what would you like?"
And she goes, "I would like to have a car."
I thought we were at least 10 years away from that.
Oh, it's gonna be here before you know it.
You know, remember ages ago,
You and I had a really big fight?
And I told you, I said,
"You're like coming up for fresh air.
Like I was drowning, and you saved me."
I still feel that way
when I see you, what we have, our family.
That's the feeling. It's you.
It's always been you.
And I want more.
Of this, of us, of --
I want to have more.
Let's have more.
I mean it.
You're crazy.
That's not a no.
Another baby?
Sure.
Uh, seriously?
I'm completely serious.
Like right now, you want to --
Oh, no, you are serious.
And now I see it, like 20 yards out,
nothing but fear and panic on the pilot's face.
You could see into the cockpit?
We locked eyes, and then at the last second,
I dove into the passenger seat.
I could feel the plane.
Dr. Webber? Can I grab you for a second?
Uh, excuse me.
So, I've heard you tell this story
six different ways today,
and each time, the plane seems to be getting closer.
I'm pretty sure, the next time it'll end with,
"And then I died."
I-I think you're missing the point here.
I guarantee I am.
Maybe I didn't exactly die back there,
but I-I sure as hell could have.
I did look up from my car today.
I did see a plane coming toward me.
And for a split second, I did find myself thinking,
"Maybe this is it.
This is where it all ends on 37th Street.
Between a yarn shop and a falafel stand."
I know what a near-death experience is,
and this wasn't my first.
And it's true.
Your life flashes right before your eyes.
And this morning, mine did.
And suddenly, I saw how much I had.
Catherine.
This hospital, all of the people I've affected,
all the people who've affected me.
And let me tell you.
It scared the hell out of me.
Because the minute you see all the things you have,
you see all the things that you stand to lose.
Look, maybe I did embellish the story some.
I mean, that's human nature, I guess.
But right now, I'm taking stock of what I have,
and I'm feeling pretty grateful.
Alex, hey.
I'm sorry that I snapped at you.
I know that you were trying to make me feel better, but --
I was making me feel better.
It's just -- I wanted you to be okay, all right?
I'm sick of feeling bad.
Why? Why would you feel bad?
Do you know it was me who cut off your leg?
Callie was stuck in surgery,
and your circulation collapsed from sepsis,
and she decided you had to lose it.
But I made the cut. I'm the one who did it.
Just -- I don't know if you knew that or wanted to,
but it's true.
Are you pissed?
I mean, you can be pissed. I get it.
Thanks.
For telling me.
You're sure it's okay that we're up here?
Oh, yeah, totally sure.
Uh, but maybe keep your voice down.
People are sleeping. That's all.
Okay.
All right. Here we are.
This is him?
This is Sam.
You don't recognize him at all?
I...
I don't know.
Dr. Edwards.
You know what? Take your time. I'm gonna be right back.
You are just trying to get fired, aren't you?
Dr. Shepherd, I'm sorry.
I told you to take it easy. This is not taking it easy.
She just had surgery. She should not be out of bed.
I know. I thought that if she saw --
No, I disagree.
These are not the actions of someone who thinks.
This is someone...
Oh, my god.
I'm sorry.
I know I'm supposed to keep it down, but --
we had sandwiches.
Wait -- you did?
We did.
He made them.
I don't like to eat on dates.
I never have an appetite. I'm...too nervous.
But he made them, and -- and so I took one,
and I ate it because I wasn't nervous at all.
Not with him.
We had -- we had sandwiches on his plane on our date.
On our -- our first date.
This -- this is Sam, right?
And I'm -- I'm actually remembering this?
This isn't -- I'm not just remembering what you told me?
No, the sandwich story is news to us.
I want to see his eyes.
You said they were beautiful. I don't remember.
I wish he'd open them.
He will.
So, am I still fired?
Not today. Not for this.
But who knows what you'll pull tomorrow.
Why didn't you tell me?
Hmm?
About Alex and my leg.
Freaking Karev.
Don't be mad at him.
He's an idiot.
I was trying to protect him, but why did he have to --
All this time, you let me hold it against you.
I -- why?
I made the call.
I mean, no matter what,
it was still me making the call to take your leg,
and I knew that you were going to hate me.
I didn't want you to hate Alex, too.
I wanted you to have somebody.
Thank you.
Chief!
Tell Kepner I'll be down soon to help triage the stragglers.
I thought you'd like to know Kate's memory is coming back.
It's still incomplete, but I'm expecting a full recovery.
Thank you. I'm glad to hear it.
You say I'm playing games?
I am here, ready to talk,
but you are pissed at me, so I'm getting punished.
I'm not punishing anyone, and I'm not doing this.
I want to.
I want to do this because this is unfair!
This is --
Amelia, back off.
You wanted professional.
I'm giving you professional.
No, you're not. You are hardly being civil.
I am sorry if I hurt your feelings.
I am, but --
This is not about you!
Everything isn't about you!
Then what is it?!
There was a plane crash.
Yes.
Not the one today.
I'm talking about the plane that had Meredith and Derek
and Arizona and Mark and Lexie and -
and Cristina.
I put them on that plane.
I-I signed the requisition for the airline.
I paid for it. I was in charge.
I don't care how long I've been out of the service.
It was my watch, and they were my men.
And...
I failed them.
It was my fault.
So, when something like this happens today,
it brings it all back up.
There was a plane crash.
Owen.
And I won't survive another plane crash, Amelia.
And that's all we are.
Why do bad things happen to good people?
We ask that question so often,
it becomes a cliche.
But that's because bad things do happen to good people.
Constantly.
You just have to hope that when it's your turn,
You'll know what to do...
...how to cope...
how to persevere.
Help you with something, Edwards?
No, sir.
What are you doing?
I am enjoying the view, sir.
Me too, Edwards.
Me too.
But the truth is...
...you don't know how you'll react
to your worst-case scenario.
None of us do...
...not until it happens.
