the reaper .
the boston reaper ?
if you stop hunting me i &apos;ll stop hunting them .
i don &apos;t make deals . i &apos;m the guy who hunts guys like you .
you &apos;ll regret this .
wake up derek. it &apos;s time to die .
george foyet is the reaper .
where &apos;s my badge ?
foyet escaped .
guards found him in his cell vomiting blood and convulsing .
they rushed him to the prison hospital .
they &apos;re gonna find him right ?
no they &apos;re not .
you should have made a deal .
all units in the vicinity of north harney boulevard
shots fired at 751 north harney .
repeat all units shots fired
at 751 north harney .
we &apos;re not working a case .
why call us to a crime scene ?
i was hoping you knew .
jj said the police told her it was urgent .
4 hours of sleep after what we went through in canada it better be .
oh you guys are already here .
you guys remember detective walker ?
thanks for being here .
i understand none of you are working on much rest .
who &apos;s the victim ?
his name is nelson martinez .
from what we can figure he answered his door
was forced into the apartment at gunpoint
and then shot in the chest. it was all pretty sloppy .
no disrespect but i don &apos;t understand why you need us here .
2 days ago a local doctor named tom barton
found a note addressed to him at the hospital .
it said the person was planning to kill his son .
if dr. barton tried to keep his boy hidden
one person would die every day in his place .
and you think this is connected ?
the note is signed l.c.
yesterday we had another victim .
multiple gunshots outside the apartment .
the shooter wrote l.c. in white chalk next to the body .
now unless dr. barton puts his son in harm &apos;s way
we &apos;re going to keep having a victim a day .
where &apos;s barton now ?
he &apos;s at home. he doesn &apos;t know about this victim yet .
where &apos;s hotch ?
he &apos;s not answering his cell . i assume it &apos;s on vibrate .
he &apos;ll get the message when he wakes up .
try him again .
he can meet us at barton &apos;s house .
you &apos;ve reached supervisory special agent aaron hotchner .
please leave a detailed message. thank you .
hotch jj again .
listen we &apos;re gonna need you to meet us at an address
in mclean virginia-- 120 kensington road .
call me when you get this .
dr. barton where is your son right now ?
um i asked him to stay up in his room .
and what did you tell him ?
i told him that there was a threat against me at the hospital .
i told him the police didn &apos;t take it seriously
but that they wanted me to stay here for a few days
and that i wanted to have him with me .
and jeffrey &apos;s mother ?
she died when he was 10 .
breast cancer .
would someone really hurt jeffrey ?
2 people are dead already .
whoever sent that note is obviously serious .
and if i don &apos;t let jeffrey out of the house
then another person &apos;s gonna die ?
right now we have to assume that he will keep killing .
my son is 15 years old .
i understand .
i cannot put him in danger .
we are not asking you to .
and even if you were willing
we couldn &apos;t send him to school
knowing he would endanger every student in the building .
what we need to do now
is go over everything we know
piece together how this person fits into your life .
well i--i-- i can &apos;t think of anyone
who would want to kill jeffrey .
whoever wrote that note was putting you on notice--
this is personal .
he wants you to remember who he is
and until that happens he hasn &apos;t accomplished what he set out to do .
i know you &apos;ve been asked this before but please
think again-- do you know anyone with the initials l.c.
i &apos;ve looked everywhere--
day planner emails
patient lists. there &apos;s no one .
have you noticed anyone who might have been watching you
either at the hospital or here in the neighborhood ?
i ... i &apos;m sorry .
both the victims he &apos;s killed have been hispanic men in their 40s .
have you had a patient recently that fits the description ?
i &apos;m a trauma surgeon in d.c.
i have endless patients all demographics .
we &apos;re gonna need records of all your recent surgeries .
of course .
i &apos;ll call garcia .
i--i don &apos;t understand .
if he &apos;s mad at me why not just kill me ?
jj. is there any word from hotch ?
no nothing .
huh. that &apos;s not like him .
yeah i know .
it &apos;s mine .
hello ?
dad ?
jeffrey ?
please don &apos;t be mad at me .
what--what &apos;s happening ? are you ok ?
jeffrey what &apos;s going on ?
talk to me .
he &apos;s not up here .
jeffrey where are you ?
i &apos;m at school .
i &apos;m ok. please tell the police that i &apos;m ok .
jeffrey .
i love you .
karl krauss said
&quot; a weak man has doubts before a decision .
a strong man has them afterwards . &quot;
dr. barton please .
you need to go back inside .
i &apos;m coming with you . i &apos;m gonna get my son .
sir right now nobody is getting your son .
agent prentiss will explain it .
i don &apos;t need an explanation . i &apos;m getting jeffrey .
you need to listen right now .
once your son left this house
the safest place for him to be is at that school .
we can control access in and out .
detective walker will organize an evacuation
as soon as the school day is done .
but if we incite a panic now
and the unsub is outside a lot of kids are gonna die .
what if the killer is already at the school ?
then we &apos;ll be there too .
let us do our job .
jeffrey knows better than this .
he doesn &apos;t put himself in danger .
i think he &apos;s just trying to do the right thing .
he sees what his father does for a living .
this is his way of trying to save lives too .
you &apos;ll be there ?
yes .
tell him i &apos;m not mad at him .
tell him i love him and uh ...
i &apos;m proud of him .
we will .
this guy &apos;s a trauma surgeon
working a major metropolitan area .
we are talking thousands of surgeries .
confine it to the last 6 months .
that &apos;s still hundreds .
i know .
ok do you want biographical information
or full medical charts ?
can you get the full medical charts ?
you know for a smart boy
you still ask a lot of dumb questions .
you &apos;ll have them in seconds .
hey garcia .
yes my love .
has hotch checked in with you ?
he &apos;s not with you ?
he &apos;s probably on his way .
uh thanks for everything. bye .
she &apos;s going to email the files . we &apos;ll print them out from here .
i could have my office send over the files .
no no trust us this is faster .
we need to dig through your life
and try to figure out why this is happening .
let &apos;s start with the most recent cases first
something set this guy off and odds are it &apos;s in your files .
i need to notify all the parents .
we think that &apos;s a mistake .
i &apos;m in charge of keeping these kids safe .
exactly. and there &apos;s a natural end to this day
when buses and parents come to pick these kids up .
whoever &apos;s doing this is not an effectual shooter .
his killings are sloppy .
so if there &apos;s a panic a lot of people could be caught in the crossfire .
can &apos;t you just take jeffrey home ?
if we do that and the unsub is watching
someone else is gonna be killed .
then what ?
we lock up every filter point except the front door .
nobody comes in. we say it &apos;s school policy .
no questions. and if someone needs to see a student
we bring the kids to them .
i &apos;ll need a complete list and employment records
of everyone already inside the building .
i &apos;ll brief your security guards
and take care of all of the exits .
after that i need you to gather the faculty
into small groups and bring them to me .
treat it as routine .
and in the meantime i need you
to get jeffrey out of class as casually as possible .
can you do that ?
jeffrey barton .
can i see you for a moment ?
hey jeffrey .
my name &apos;s derek morgan . i &apos;m with the fbi .
i saw you in my living room .
listen the first thing i need to know
is if you &apos;ve told anyone about what &apos;s happening ?
no .
back to class. no loitering .
jeffrey you &apos;re sure ?
because even just one text message could set this place off .
i &apos;m sure .
all right that &apos;s good .
we &apos;re gonna keep you safe kid .
but in order to do that you &apos;re gonna have to stay calm .
and you &apos;re also gonna have to trust me .
you understand ?
every time you step out of class
i will be right here .
now it &apos;s gonna look like i &apos;m just another
adult in the hallway with principal findlay
but i got your back .
is my dad ok ?
he knows you were just trying to do the right thing .
he just wants to get you home safe .
do you think somebody &apos;s trying to kill me
to get back at him ?
it is possible .
do you know why ?
that &apos;s what we need to figure out .
let &apos;s concentrate on the note .
for starters we know that he &apos;s male .
how can you be sure ?
women tend to add adjectives
and very specific details to their notes .
this has none of those .
males are also more direct .
first sentence-- &quot; i plan to kill your son . &quot;
and their notes tend to be more about themselves
than the person they &apos;re writing to .
&quot; i watched you every day . &quot;
&quot; i will watch you lose everything . &quot;
we know he surveilled you and your son
which means he either has enough money
to be away from a regular job
or he &apos;s currently unemployed .
he &apos;s most likely a father .
he &apos;s clearly grieving .
he &apos;s taken great measures to make sure you feel his pain .
let &apos;s start with cases involving teenagers killed
but also anyone with a strong family presence .
just because your son is 15
that doesn &apos;t necessarily mean that his child is the same age .
have you had a lot of cases like this
where someone taunts you with what they &apos;re gonna do ?
a few .
and how did they end ?
please .
suicide by cop seems to be an effective way
for them to make their point
while ending their suffering all at once .
jeffrey is leaving school in 5 hours .
there &apos;s no way we can get through all these patients in this time .
well now we &apos;ve narrowed it down already .
and we still have 100 left .
i &apos;m sorry i don &apos;t mean to be callous
but when you work in the e.r. you don &apos;t remember names .
you operate and you move on .
he &apos;s right. there are too many files here
for us to profile in such a short period of time .
um i can get to hotch &apos;s
and get back here in half an hour .
who &apos;s that ?
he &apos;s our supervisor .
we weren &apos;t supposed to work today .
we &apos;re having trouble getting ahold of him .
but we need more eyes .
the note doesn &apos;t say that he &apos;ll kill jeffrey today
it says &quot; if not today tomorrow or the next day . &quot;
let &apos;s say he gets home safe .
how long will you all be around to make sure he &apos;s ok ?
let &apos;s just get through today .
hotch ? it &apos;s me--emily .
overtime shift. penelope speaking .
garcia it &apos;s emily .
i need you to listen really carefully .
something &apos;s happened to hotch .
what do you mean something ?
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m in his place. he &apos;s not here but there &apos;s blood .
oh my god .
i need you to send police
and fbi techs here right away .
everyone available .
uh do we need an apb ?
only on hotch . i checked out front. his car &apos;s still here .
someone took him ?
i don &apos;t know . there &apos;s blood but i can &apos;t be sure whose it is .
just get people here .
ok i &apos;m sending an army .
garcia i &apos;m gonna have to tell reid
because he &apos;s expecting me back
but you can &apos;t tell the others .
they cannot be distracted .
ok. ok .
hey .
what ?
what--what are you talking about ?
what &apos;s going on ?
is this about jeffrey ?
no no it &apos;s unrelated .
we only have a few hours left here .
i &apos;m really sorry i have to take this phone call ok ?
what could be more important than my son right now ?
i assure you this will take one second. please i promise .
fine .
there &apos;s a huge hole in the wall .
probably a .44 but there &apos;s no blood or tissue spray around it .
any idea how he got out ?
if he was shot there are no drag marks .
but a body could have been wrapped in something .
and bureau techs are on the way ?
any second .
all right um write down everything you see
and we &apos;ll profile from your notes when you get back .
how &apos;s dr. barton ?
it &apos;s a huge list of cases to go through with him .
ok don &apos;t worry about here . i &apos;ve got this. just stay focused .
all right. you too .
uh dr. barton ?
sorry about that .
agent prentiss has been called away on an emergency .
you gotta be kidding me .
i &apos;m confident that the two of us
can do this together right now. all right ?
we know he &apos;s been killing hispanic males as surrogates .
did you separate the case files ?
yeah .
all right how many of the surgeries
fit the criteria ?
um 82 .
all right. now let me ask you this .
on how many of those dates
did you operate on somebody else as well ?
75 .
did any of those patients die on the table ?
10. um no wait . 11 .
11. that &apos;s where we start .
this whole thing is about choice .
he &apos;s forcing you to play god with your son
because the last time you had a choice
your decision devastated him .
i &apos;m a doctor . i save people .
it doesn &apos;t matter to him. all that matters to him
is that you had an alternative
and you didn &apos;t take it .
now how many of those surgeries
involve patients under 20 ?
uh ... 6 .
we get a lot of shootings
mostly gang related .
has a gang member
or family member ever threatened you ?
no uh at first
when you lose someone
it &apos;s mostly confusion and devastation .
the anger comes later .
all right we have 6 dates where you operated
on an hispanic male
on the same night a patient under 20 died .
what i &apos;m gonna do is i &apos;m gonna read the names and dates
and you tell me anything you can remember ok ?
ok .
all right let &apos;s start with january 22nd .
tyler hayes multiple gunshot wounds .
february 13th brian douglas
hit @-@ and @-@ run victim lacerated aorta .
no .
march 15th devon marks
heroin overdose .
angela harris another car accident
single vehicle bleeding into her brain .
i ... this is no use .
i would remember if i was threatened .
did any of them ask you about your family ?
we have time .
ok .
i talked to detective walker .
final bell &apos;s at 3 : 10. he &apos;s gonna have a s.w.a.t. unit
in place at exactly 3 : 00 to escort kids out .
we &apos;ll need you to gather the students at 2 : 45 .
this could all be happening now .
if the unsub sees us evacuate early
we feel certain he &apos;ll kill another random citizen .
and this also buys us a day to try and
discover his identity .
so we &apos;ll have school buses for evacuation .
teachers can brief parents who are here to pick up their kids .
the key is to keep jeffrey isolated
and avoid panic with the other students .
if we can do that
everybody gets out of here safe .
have you cross @-@ checked all the records of employees in the building
against dr. barton ?
garcia &apos;s on it .
emily .
no. sorry baby girl just little old me .
you &apos;re out of luck .
right. sorry .
did you finish the background check
on everyone in the building ?
yeah. uh no red flags no felonies
no connection to barton .
ok well that &apos;s good .
all right listen i gotta go. there &apos;s about to be a bell .
all right. be safe .
hey. everything ok ?
yeah. oh yeah i &apos;m just tired .
yeah i hear you .
let &apos;s just get this kid home safe
and we can all sleep .
right .
excuse me .
i &apos;m supposed to meet with principal findlay .
can you tell me where her office is ?
georgetown hospital .
hi. my name &apos;s penelope garcia . i &apos;m from the fbi .
i was calling to see if an agent aaron hotchner
had been admitted to the emergency room ?
supervisory special agent aaron hotchner .
hotchner aaron .
i wanted to see if he had been admitted or if ...
yeah he &apos;s an fbi agent .
what ...
when was that ?
ok. thank you .
oh my god .
talk to me garcia .
ok i--i called hospitals to see if hotch
had gotten himself admitted to an emergency room .
and ?
he &apos;s not listed as a patient
but someone dropped a john doe off
at st. sebastian hospital
and that someone &apos;s name
was fbi agent derek morgan .
it doesn &apos;t make sense .
i know. do you think they got their credentials mixed up ?
the reaper .
foyet took morgan &apos;s creds .
why would he drop him off at the e.r. ?
what hospital did you say again ?
st. sebastian hospital .
i &apos;ll call you with an update when i get there .
yeah .
i don &apos;t understand .
these surgeries are all hours apart .
i didn &apos;t have to choose between patients .
if he &apos;s punishing me for my choices
none of these fit .
all right look at the note again
and compare against the wording on the charts .
a lot of times an unsub
will unconsciously mirror
the wording of situations .
you remember something ?
uh i don &apos;t know. it was right after new year &apos;s .
there was a car accident .
one of the victims was hispanic .
new year &apos;s ...
january 3rd there &apos;s a 2 @-@ car collision
you operated on a hector ledezma .
that was your only surgery that night .
mrs. ledezma ?
the collision lacerated his kidney .
he lost a lot of blood .
but we were able to repair the damage .
so it &apos;ll take some time but he &apos;ll be just fine .
what about my son ?
i &apos;m sorry ?
jason meyers. he &apos;s 18 .
he was in the accident .
your son was dead when he arrived here .
that &apos;s because
i didn &apos;t operate on the boy .
they told me he &apos;s breathing .
he &apos;s been put on life support .
but um ... i &apos;m afraid he no longer has brain function .
i &apos;m very sorry .
you &apos;re not even gonna operate .
it &apos;s too late .
you don &apos;t even know who he was .
she had to give you the chart .
i &apos;m sorry .
do you have children ?
a son .
what would you say to a doctor
who wouldn &apos;t even try to save him ?
i &apos;m sorry . i know it &apos;s hard to understand believe me
but there is nothing i can do .
garcia i need you to find a patient in the system
named jason meyers .
he was admitted january 3rd
on life support .
oh no .
what ?
he was taken off the ventilator
and declared legally dead 3 days ago .
who &apos;s his father ?
yeah uh patrick meyers age 45 .
get a photo into the school immediately .
i think he &apos;s our unsub .
ok. yeah. it &apos;s on its way .
he was stabbed 9 times
but no major arteries were hit .
it &apos;s a miracle he &apos;s alive .
when will he wake up ?
the anesthesia should wear off within the hour .
but he &apos;s bound to be out of it .
ok .
may i stay here ?
of course .
thank you .
don &apos;t worry. as soon as the building &apos;s clear
you &apos;re gonna get your own escort out of here .
come on no pushing. one at a time .
let &apos;s keep it moving .
nice and orderly .
this abbreviation right here l.c.
what does that stand for ?
where are you going ?
the note says not to deviate from my routine
and i always pick up jeffrey on my days off .
i &apos;m gonna come with you .
l.c. on the unsub &apos;s note .
it stands for &quot; living children . &quot;
are you sure ?
it &apos;s administrative. it &apos;s when they &apos;re afraid
a patient &apos;s gonna go on life support
and they don &apos;t have a dnr order .
reid ?
what if the unsub was trying to tell dr. barton
that he is actually the target
and that he &apos;s gonna leave his son without a father ?
barton !
doctor !
reid ?
answer me .
reid ?
this is special agent emily prentiss from the fbi .
i need police and an ambulance
to 120 kensington road mclean virginia .
shots fired federal agent possibly down .
are you hit ? no .
get my gun. my gun .
get away from him ! get away from him .
whatever you do stay down .
don &apos;t protect him. drop the gun !
he killed my son !
he did not kill your son. your son
was killed by a car accident .
stand up !
i &apos;m gonna ask you again
i do not want to shoot you
please drop the gun .
stand up you coward !
mr. meyers listen to me .
all right it &apos;s over .
dr. barton did not kill your son .
your son was killed by a car .
and this is not what he would want .
ok ?
so drop the gun .
please .
don &apos;t do it .
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m fine. go to him. go to him .
kick his gun away. make sure his gun &apos;s not near him .
no ... no don &apos;t touch me .
oh i want to die .
oh don &apos;t touch me .
i need to stop the bleeding ok ?
let me die .
the medics are almost here .
can you keep him stabilized ?
yes i think so .
hold on hold on they &apos;re right here .
help is coming all right ?
hold on hold on .
we need a backboard and a c @-@ collar .
coming right up .
put pressure on this right here .
call ahead to the e.r. tell them they got a gsw
to the thoracic cavity and have
him redlined the o.r. step
ohh ... don &apos;t touch me .
looks like it went clean through .
you might have just saved his life .
keep pressure on this ok ?
i &apos;m good i &apos;m fine. go to your son. i &apos;m good. i &apos;m fine. go .
jeffrey .
you ok ?
yeah fine .
we &apos;ll get you to a hospital .
you need to find emily. call emily .
where is she ?
something &apos;s happened to hotch .
he still isn &apos;t conscious yet .
you sure it was foyet ?
he had morgan &apos;s credentials .
did they catch him on the security cam ?
you could see him dropping hotch off
but the camera &apos;s only on the entrance
so i have no idea what direction
he went once left the hospital .
it doesn &apos;t make sense for him to
have brought hotch to the e.r.
we know foyet gets off on power and control .
maybe what he wants is for hotch
to know his life was in his hands .
he could do that without risking the hospital .
agents he &apos;s waking up .
remember he &apos;s weak. don &apos;t push him .
where am i ?
in the hospital .
how did i get here ?
foyet drove you .
can you remember what happened ?
you should have made a deal .
what did he take ?
what do you mean ?
the reaper always takes something from his victims .
do we know what he took ?
there was a page missing from your day planner
in the address section the bs .
what did he leave ?
i don &apos;t know .
he also leaves something with his victims .
i looked over your whole apartment .
nothing felt out of place .
where are my clothes ?
haley &apos;s maiden name is brooks .
i always listed her in the
bs in my personal information
in case it fell into the wrong hands .
he knows where they live .
haley &apos;s not answering .
garcia .
right here .
i need fbi s.w.a.t. deployed to hotch &apos;s old address .
do it now .
oh god do you think he &apos;s going after haley and jack ?
i don &apos;t know. just send a s.w.a.t. team .
tell them to wait for instructions. we &apos;re on our way .
consider them there .
we need to be prepared for what we might find .
foyet kept hotch alive. he
wouldn &apos;t do that without a reason .
you should have made a deal .
is this part of my profile--
you can &apos;t show me fear ?
if you don &apos;t see fear maybe it &apos;s
because i &apos;m not afraid of you .
you said that like you actually meant it .
how &apos;s my friend agent morgan ?
are you here to kill me
or are you here to play games ?
you tell me .
enlighten me about my behavior .
so tell me
would i use this ?
what happened ?
i don &apos;t know .
agent hotchner. can you hear me ?
agent hotchner ?
i &apos;m ok .
i &apos;m gonna need you to step out of the room .
breathe in slowly .
and exhale .
ready in back ?
ready .
go !
oh my god ! it &apos;s ok. it &apos;s ok .
what are you doing here ?
it &apos;s ok. everything &apos;s ok .
we got her .
what &apos;s going on ?
is there anyone else in the house ?
no there &apos;s no one here .
haley where &apos;s jack ?
he &apos;s at a friend &apos;s house for a play date .
we &apos;ll explain everything .
where &apos;s aaron ?
he &apos;s in the hospital .
what ?
haley please .
call for jack. tell them i &apos;m on the way to pick him up .
i promise you we &apos;ll explain .
call for him right now .
text me the address .
tell me what happened to aaron .
they will kill you .
don &apos;t speak .
you lost a lot of blood .
you &apos;ll need your oxygen .
do you know how much you have to study the human body
to stab yourself repeatedly and not die ?
i don &apos;t want to brag but i &apos;m somewhat of an expert .
do you want to see my scars ?
what do you think ?
you like &apos; em ?
yours are gonna look just the same .
my team ...
your team .
your team didn &apos;t catch me until i wanted them to .
you &apos;re not in charge so don &apos;t be foolish .
now try to relax .
your body will go numb .
and it goes in so much easier ...
if you relax .
the hard part
is not passing out from the pain .
now i understand that profilers think
that stabbing is a substitution for the act of sex .
that if somebody &apos;s impotent
they &apos;ll use a knife instead .
is that what you think agent hotchner ?
maybe this will change the way that you profile .
they &apos;re safe .
is this really necessary ?
i &apos;m afraid so .
for how long ?
i don &apos;t know .
mommy !
they let me turn on the siren !
wow that &apos;s so great baby ! did you have fun ?
i &apos;ll help start a bag in jack &apos;s room .
ok .
how many times did you run it ?
how many times ? 3 ?
you were at my place right ?
could you tell how he got in ?
i &apos;m not sure .
do you want to talk about what happened ?
i don &apos;t know .
after he stabbed me the first time it all goes blank .
how do you feel ?
i &apos;m gonna be ok .
did they explain to you what &apos;s happening ?
they said the marshals service
is taking us straight from here
and putting us into protective custody .
haley i &apos;m sorry .
do you know where they &apos;re gonna take us ?
no i don &apos;t .
and that &apos;s the point .
i can &apos;t know where you &apos;re going .
if you have any contact with anyone
then he could track you .
jack has school. he has friends .
i have a job now .
i know .
and i &apos;m sorry .
we will catch him
and you &apos;ll come back
and i promise that i will spend the rest of my life
making this up to you .
are you sure that we &apos;re in danger ?
yes .
and what about you ? are you gonna be safe ?
he wants to see me suffer .
knowing that my son is out there
and that i can &apos;t see him is better than killing me .
what am i supposed to say to jack ?
tell him it &apos;s a vacation
and that it &apos;s not gonna be for very long .
how am i supposed to keep him safe
if there is no one i know to help me ?
haley you &apos;re strong .
you lived with me in this job
and you &apos;ve practically raised jack all by yourself .
you &apos;re a great mother .
can you catch this man ?
i will catch this man .
jack wants to come in .
i want to see him too .
i just don &apos;t think it &apos;s a good idea .
look i know you &apos;re trying to protect him .
please .
ok .
hey buddy .
come on in .
all right .
don &apos;t worry. it &apos;s ok .
the doctors made sure that i &apos;m completely fine .
did mommy tell you that you two are gonna take a trip ?
yeah .
so i &apos;m not gonna see you for a while .
why ?
well think about it like when daddy goes away for work .
only this time you and mommy get to go someplace .
but what do i tell you every time i go away ?
you love me .
more than anything in the world .
are you ok ?
i &apos;m very proud of you .
every single day .
i &apos;ll see you soon ok ?
ok .
you take care of mom ok ?
ok .
i know aaron &apos;s worried .
tell him i &apos;ll protect them like they &apos;re my own .
i just talked to spence. he &apos;s gonna be fine .
he &apos;s gonna have to be on crutches for a while
but he said kicking down doors is morgan &apos;s job anyway .
you know foyet having your credentials
had nothing to do with any of this .
it was just his way of trying to torture you .
yeah i know .
foyet &apos;s about power and control .
he was hoping to watch me fall apart and ...
now he wants to destroy hotch .
exactly .
that &apos;s his plan
and now we fight it .
did you hear what happened this morning ?
no .
we had a situation .
unsub had already killed 2 people .
said he was gonna keep killing
unless a man used his son as bait .
what happened ?
we kept the boy safe .
worked the profile .
it was a happy ending .
do you know why i &apos;m telling you this ?
yes .
no other group in the world
could have pulled off what your team did
in a matter of hours .
i appreciate what you &apos;re trying to do dave .
we &apos;ll get foyet .
i promised haley that we would get him
but the truth is if he stops killing
we have no way of tracking him .
he stopped killing for 10 years just for the pleasure
of watching shaunessy &apos;s life fall apart .
what &apos;s jack gonna remember about me in 10 years ?
hotch look at me .
i &apos;m telling you
