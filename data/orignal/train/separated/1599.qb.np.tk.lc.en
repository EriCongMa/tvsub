i cheated on my boyfriend
and i lost my virginity to wyatt , callie &apos;s ex @-@ boyfriend .
i got a grandma .
is she ...
she &apos;s in a home . she got dementia .
look , i ran your brother &apos;s name through the system .
he hasn &apos;t been arrested .
if he &apos;s not in jail , can you see if he &apos;s dead ?
&apos;cause he &apos;s all i got .
i went to juvie to talk with a.j. ,
we &apos;ve decided i &apos;m going to foster him .
it &apos;s going to take some time for mike to get his license .
in the meantime , a.j. &apos; s going to stay here with us .
i got fired from the drop @-@ in center because of you .
brandon , you &apos;ll be working with kat .
there &apos;s no way you &apos;re pairing me with him .
you and kat , setting me up .
you get me to that party ...
and when i don &apos;t show up to work in the morning ,
i look like a flake ...
dude , that &apos;s insane !
is it ?
i might have to deal with her , but i don &apos;t have to deal with you .
you signed your name to a bach fugue ?
and i knew you would say it was crap .
i &apos;ve had enough of you two making a joke of this program .
you &apos;re out !
sorry . sorry ...
what are you doing in my room ?
i need you to come with me .
why ?
i need your help with something .
oh , with what ?
i will tell you later .
just get dressed and then meet me outside . okay ?
okay .
and bring your car keys . come on .
morning !
morning .
oh , am i too early ?
too early for what ?
ah , oscar ! you &apos;re here .
mrs. foster , hello .
i thought you were starting on monday .
no , we said today , right ?
yeah , you told me sooner the better .
wait , you hired a contractor ?
i was gonna talk to you about it this weekend .
oh , i see , and by &quot; talk to me about it , &quot;
you mean you were gonna pretend like i had some say in this .
honey , we had to make a decision .
except we didn &apos;t make a decision , you did .
if this is a bad time ...
no , no , no , no , no . we &apos;ve waited long enough .
come on in . go straight through . you know where you &apos;re going .
okay .
all right . thanks , oscar .
okay ...
if i have to share a bathroom with those kids for one more day ,
i &apos;m going to kill myself .
now , i realize to you that sounds good right about now ,
but getting all of those quotes was taking forever .
you want to handle something all by yourself ?
the raccoons got into the garbage .
okay ...
callie , we &apos;re almost at the border .
yeah .
okay . well , if we keep going ,
we &apos;re gonna , you know , be in mexico .
okay , see ... mexico is another country
and if we cross that border our moms will kill us .
look , there &apos;s something i have to do
that i &apos;m not really allowed to do in the state of california .
at least not without parental consent .
like something illegal ?
callie ...
hi , love , i know you &apos;re mad and i &apos;m sorry to bother you ...
we need to go to therapy .
what ?
we &apos;ve got to start communicating .
okay , if this is about what just happened , i take complete blame .
it &apos;s me . it &apos;s my fault , all right ?
it &apos;s not just a one @-@ time thing .
we have to learn how to do better .
we &apos;re communicating right now ! we &apos;re ...
sure , we talk .
but most times i don &apos;t feel heard .
well , i wasn &apos;t feeling heard
when i told you that i was frustrated
with your endless stream of contractor quotes .
see , this is what i &apos;m talking about .
i tell you something that &apos;s bothering me
and you turn it right back around on me .
what ...
we &apos;re never gonna get anywhere
if we keep pointing the finger at each other .
that &apos;s why we need a neutral third party to ...
what ? to tell us that you &apos;re right and i &apos;m wrong ?
no ! to help us both learn how to listen ...
okay . jenna and kelly went to therapy
and where are they ? they broke up .
well , by the time they started going , it was too late .
okay , speaking of too late , does this happen to belong to you ?
or is this something that you
prefer to say with a neutral third party around ?
busted .
i &apos;ve been having an affair with mr. nesbit next door ,
and now i &apos;m pregnant with an inflatable snowman .
well , that &apos;s actually preferable to the other scenarios
running around in my head right now .
sorry . can you get that for me ?
oh , my ...
not a problem .
someone in this house is afraid they &apos;re pregnant
and i think we should find out who it is .
morning .
how &apos;s my love bug ?
sorry about all the noise .
where &apos;s callie ?
um , she said she was going
to the library to work on her history paper .
and why are you still in bed ?
day off .
everything okay ?
yeah . everything &apos;s fine .
good .
and everything &apos;s okay with mat ?
actually , we broke up .
oh , no . mariana , what happened ?
well , the tour got extended , so ...
he &apos;s basically gonna be on the road all summer
and i just felt like ...
i don &apos;t know , like i was holding him back .
from what ?
having fun ...
hooking up with other girls , i guess .
other girls ...
so you and mat have hooked up ?
well , duh !
we were boyfriend and girlfriend .
okay .
did you use a condom ?
what ?
when you hooked up .
mama , hooking up doesn &apos;t mean sex .
i thought that &apos;s what the kids called it now .
well , it can mean sex ,
but it also means a lot of other things .
so ...
you and mat didn &apos;t have sex ?
no .
why are you asking ?
no reason . i just think it &apos;s ...
it &apos;s good to check in every now and then .
okay .
so , um ...
did callie mention when she might be back from the library ?
no .
all right .
last time i was here , she didn &apos;t even know who i was .
still , i bet she enjoys seeing a friendly face , huh ?
when all else fails , there &apos;s always chocolate , right ?
amen to that .
how are you ?
hi .
it &apos;s just , sometimes grandma gets upset ...
you want me to go in there with you ?
only if you want to .
yeah .
hey , grandma .
well , look who &apos;s here !
i know i &apos;m long overdue ,
but it &apos;s great to see you . you look good .
oh , i &apos;ve seen better days ,
and don &apos;t you try telling me otherwise .
here . let me help you sit down .
how long has it been ?
two months .
no !
i &apos;m afraid so .
now remind me ...
where have we met ?
uh , miss hensdale ?
iris , please .
pleasure to meet you , iris . my name is mike foster .
oh , dear .
am i under arrest ?
no , no , no . god , no .
no , i &apos;m looking after your grandson now .
my grandson ?
here , grandma , i brought you your favorite .
oh , i like these better than flowers .
that &apos;s what i figured .
so nice to see you .
how long has it been ?
i think this is the place .
you &apos;re kidding me . callie , what is this ?
you &apos;ll see .
wow , there &apos;s like no one here .
yeah . no one to hear us scream .
we have beaches in san diego .
what &apos;s here that we can &apos;t do at home ?
that .
come on , brandon , it &apos;ll be fun .
callie , i thought this was serious .
okay ? i thought you were in trouble .
well , so be happy that i &apos;m not .
okay , i &apos;m sorry i didn &apos;t tell you .
i just figured if you knew what we were gonna do ,
then you &apos;d probably try to talk me out of it .
oh , i &apos;m definitely talking you out of it .
we &apos;re not hang gliding .
oh , come on .
if you could have one superpower , what would it be ?
callie ... i ...
seriously , answer the question .
i don &apos;t know . like , read minds
or be invisible or something .
okay . well , i wanna fly .
come on , i just got my driver &apos;s license .
i &apos;m finally off probation ...
i can go anywhere i want to go ...
for the first time in my life , i &apos;m free .
i just wanna do something completely nuts .
well , this qualifies .
oh , come on . i need this .
all right ? and you do , too .
brandon , i &apos;m ...
almost 17 and i don &apos;t have any good stories .
that &apos;s why i brought you here . i just wanted to do something
completely crazy with my best friend .
well , it ... would make a good story .
aren &apos;t these delicious ?
have you met my grandson ?
uh , yes , i have . he &apos;s a good kid .
isn &apos;t he ?
he comes to see me every week .
it &apos;s not every week , grandma ...
but i &apos;ll be back soon .
i hope so .
thanks for the flowers .
it was the chocolates that i brought ...
but you &apos;re welcome .
it was nice to meet you .
you okay ?
yeah .
it must be hard seeing your grandma like that , i mean ...
you guys were pretty close , right ?
not as close as my brother .
she had more good years with him , but yeah , i guess .
he ever visit her ?
used to , yeah .
that look like it say &quot; ty hensdale &quot; to you ?
yeah .
according to this , he was here two days ago .
went straight to voice mail .
why didn &apos;t you leave a message ?
what am i gonna say ...
&quot; hey callie , it &apos;s mama , just checking
to see if you &apos;re pregnant . give us a call . &quot;
no , just that you &apos;re checking in and to get in touch .
are you really gonna micromanage a phone call now ?
if you think you can do better , go ahead .
all i &apos;m saying is ,
i think it &apos;s strange that callie didn &apos;t answer her phone .
why ? she &apos;s in a library .
maybe not .
so she turned off her phone .
they don &apos;t turn off their phones , lena .
they might miss a text or twit ... tweet .
i think they snapchat these days .
but then again , i thought that hooking up meant sex .
it doesn &apos;t ?
apparently not .
anyway , my point is ,
is that they only turn off
their phones if they don &apos;t want us to find them .
why wouldn &apos;t callie want us to know where she is ?
and that &apos;s the question , isn &apos;t it ?
that &apos;s it . light touch .
now ease out on the control bar and feel the lift .
move to the right .
ah , that &apos;s it .
now you &apos;re in the lift .
is that really all there is to this ?
sure .
that plus a 1,000 @-@ foot drop .
you guys are naturals .
close to listos .
he thinks we &apos;re ready .
so , now we &apos;re signing the release forms .
okay .
what &apos;s it say ?
basically , if we die , it &apos;s our own damn fault .
great !
except if i die , it &apos;s your damn fault .
not that i have much to live for these days ...
brandon ...
i &apos;m kidding .
though the idea of plummeting to my death
off a 1,000 @-@ foot cliff is only slightly less appealing
than telling moms that i got kicked out of idyllwild .
what happened anyway ?
uh , for starters ,
i got paired up with this total diva of a pianist .
really ? that bad ?
worse than you can imagine .
brilliant , but basically evil .
i mean , she &apos;d just crap on everything i did .
so , to prove a point ,
i put my name on this obscure bach piece ...
wait a second , you plagiarized ?
and of course , she called it a steaming pile of ...
right . so she &apos;s an idiot .
no , she &apos;s not the only one .
i mean , we both got kicked out .
yeah , that sucks .
big time .
but , you know , at least it &apos;s over ...
now i don &apos;t have to deal with anymore crazy ,
dramatic women in my life .
i mean , first it was kat and talya and ...
life &apos;s too short , you know .
listos ?
what the hell , right ?
yeah . what the hell .
we found this card in the flowers
and we &apos;re wondering if you remember a young man
who may have bought them from here a couple of days ago ?
uh , african @-@ american , about 20 years old .
irises . that &apos;s what he bought .
oh , yeah . i remember .
most men don &apos;t go in for irises .
it &apos;s more of an old lady flower .
they were for an old lady .
do you remember how he paid ?
you mean like credit card ?
exactly .
mmm , i don &apos;t think so .
i &apos;m pretty sure it was cash .
yeah , &apos; cause i remember he didn &apos;t have enough money ,
and he offered to put a couple of flowers back , but ...
i just let him keep the whole dozen anyway . nice kid .
did he seem okay ?
yeah . i guess so .
that &apos;s my brother . we &apos;re trying to find him .
i don &apos;t suppose he &apos;s come back in ?
sorry .
did he say anything
that might indicate where he &apos;s living ?
i wish i had more for you .
but thanks for your time .
you &apos;ll call if he comes back in , right ?
of course .
good luck , guys .
she said she was going to the library .
what else do you want me to say ?
okay .
you wanna rethink that answer and try again ?
what ? you think i &apos;m lying ?
i didn &apos;t say that .
it &apos;s just when you answered me , you looked up and to the left .
so ?
that &apos;s what people do when they lie .
how do you know that ?
because i &apos;m a highly trained police officer , mariana ,
and if you don &apos;t tell me where callie is right this second ,
you &apos;re going to be grounded
until you qualify for social security .
okay ...
they may have gone a little further than the library .
like how far ?
like ... mexico .
mexico . callie went to mexico ?
just to a beach .
and that &apos;s all i know , honest !
yeah , no , i believe you .
you said &quot; they , &quot; mariana , who is &quot; they &quot; ?
mexico ? together ?
why ? why would they do that ?
what ? what are you thinking ?
i don &apos;t even wanna say ...
say !
i just ... i can &apos;t help thinking about the pregnancy test ...
don &apos;t ! don &apos;t say that .
well , you seriously think she went down there to ...
but callie could get whatever
medical attention she would need right here .
what if she doesn &apos;t know that ?
what if she &apos;s afraid that we &apos;re going to find out ?
okay , so ... what if ... what if she is pregnant ?
why is brandon with her ?
oh , my god .
you don &apos;t think that he &apos;s the father , do you ?
mariana , get in here !
okay , hold up !
callie &apos;s pregnant with brandon &apos;s baby ?
we don &apos;t know that . we don &apos;t ...
we don &apos;t know what to think .
but why would you think that in the first place ?
because of this .
and since it doesn &apos;t belong to any of us , we could only assume ...
it &apos;s mine .
wait a minute , you told me that you didn &apos;t have sex with mat .
because i didn &apos;t have sex with mat .
who did you have sex with ?
it &apos;s not all bad news .
how you figure that ?
your brother &apos;s alive ...
and he &apos;s okay , and he &apos;s been around .
if the florist or anyone at the nursing home sees him ,
they &apos;ll let us know .
meanwhile , we &apos;ll print up some fliers with his picture , okay ?
don &apos;t give up . we &apos;re getting close .
you oughta be a detective .
detective work &apos;s pretty dull . the real action &apos;s on the street .
call to any officer in this area ,
report of an 11 @-@ 7 at 1 @-@ 2 @-@ 5 winston .
repeat , 11 @-@ 7 at 1 @-@ 2 @-@ 5 winston .
what &apos;s an 11 @-@ 7 ?
prowler on the scene . probably a burglar . not far .
car 74 solo , i &apos;m on my way with a ride @-@ along .
a ride @-@ along ? that &apos;s me ?
yeah . that &apos;s you . let &apos;s go .
okay , so the first question is ,
are you pregnant ?
no , we used a condom .
and i started my period this morning .
thank god !
so why take a pregnancy test ?
i don &apos;t know , i was freaking out .
and i felt all weird and moody ...
you &apos;re a teenager , mariana , you &apos;re always weird and moody .
and i also had a stomachache that one day .
i don &apos;t know . i was just afraid .
and mama had all those extra tests
from when she was trying to get pregnant ,
and i figured , why not ?
it was supposed to make me feel better .
well , we &apos;re not here to make you feel bad .
i guess the next question is why ?
why have sex ?
well , yeah . that , too .
but why have sex with wyatt ?
well , the plan was to have sex with mat ,
but then he didn &apos;t want to ...
so he was just backup sex ?
no ! no , no , no , no !
look , that came out wrong .
okay ?
i wanted to lose my virginity .
i &apos;m almost 16 and everyone in this house is having sex ...
maybe not jude or callie or you guys .
but you gave brandon and jesus condoms ...
i don &apos;t see what the big deal is .
losing your virginity at 15 is a big deal , mariana .
i thought you guys were feminists .
don &apos;t play that card .
we said the exact same thing to your brothers .
i don &apos;t understand why you think that this is some kind of race .
well , i did , okay ?
and i &apos;m not a virgin anymore , so ...
honey , i think what your mother is trying to say
is just that we love you ,
and we wanna understand your choices .
well , no one &apos;s pregnant .
can &apos;t you just be happy about that ?
what ?
that was harsh .
no , it wasn &apos;t . i ...
where is all of this coming from ?
i just want us to be on the same page .
obviously , mariana feels terrible about this ,
what is the point in piling on the shame ?
excuse me .
can we just table this for a minute , please ?
we have two children in mexico , doing god knows what .
callie and brandon are good kids .
they &apos;re probably just enjoying a day on the beach .
are you sure about that ?
scared ?
nah , you ?
nah !
maybe a little bit .
yeah , i &apos;m terrified .
maybe this is a bad idea , you know .
we &apos;ve had how much instruction ?
uh ... couple of hours .
and we know how much about this guy ?
next to nothing .
exactly .
how do we know he &apos;s legit ,
or if these gliders even work ?
i mean , that could be why they &apos;re on a deserted beach
and not a big resort with lawyers and cameras .
wind is up . it &apos;s time .
maybe we don &apos;t need to jump .
maybe this is all we needed to do , you know ?
just stand on the brink and then step back from it .
you know ?
together ...
together .
yeah .
i &apos;m okay with that .
okay .
what ? what &apos;s he telling us ?
to jump !
i don &apos;t think i can !
then i think we &apos;re getting arrested .
okay !
brandon !
we &apos;re flying !
how do we land ?
you can do this , all right ? we &apos;re gonna land .
and remember everything he told you , okay ?
ready ?
callie ! hey ! you okay ?
that was amazing !
you feel like a superhero ?
yeah . thank you .
that &apos;s gonna make a really good story .
all right . let &apos;s get out of here .
yeah !
all right . look , i just sit tight .
i &apos;ll be right back .
car 74 , arrived at the scene .
olynek &apos;s here , we &apos;ll go in tandem .
what &apos;s going on in there ?
we don &apos;t know .
so stay in the vehicle , got it ?
so we think he &apos;s in there ?
all right . we &apos;ll take the front .
all right .
hands in the air !
put your hands up !
get down !
hands back ! hands back now !
i &apos;m with mike ! i &apos;m with mike !
face down , do not move !
hey ! hey ! what the hell &apos;s going on ?
put that away !
got your guy &apos;s accomplice here .
he &apos;s with me ! he &apos;s my ride @-@ along !
my foster son .
i just saw him and i thought ...
yeah ! i know what you thought .
get up . you okay ?
look , i &apos;m sorry , foster .
i &apos;m not the one you should be apologizing to .
sorry .
you okay ?
yeah .
i told you to stay in the car .
no sabia ... what we were doing was ilegal .
we are inocente ! inocente !
okay , what are we supposed to do ?
&quot; a show of respect ? &quot; what does that mean ?
he says he wants respect .
yeah ...
i think it &apos;s this kind of respect ?
oh , you &apos;re kidding .
that &apos;s all i got .
i spent the rest ... how much do you have ?
i don &apos;t have anything . you told me to bring car keys .
wait . wait .
no , no , no , it &apos;s okay . i wanted to show you something .
here !
top of the linea .
usted no play the musica ?
ustedes vendes , get mucho dinero .
brandon , you can &apos;t do this .
do you have a better idea ?
i think ... i think i owe you an apology .
i ...
i wasn &apos;t trying to shame you , mariana , i wasn &apos;t .
but sex is a big deal .
every time you have sex it &apos;s a big deal .
you &apos;re sharing a vulnerable and precious part of yourself .
you should always make sure you feel good about it .
not that we &apos;re encouraging you to have sex at your age .
no , of course not .
you &apos;re young , and so are your brothers .
we give them condoms not to encourage them ,
but to protect them because we know we can &apos;t control everything .
try as we might .
listen ...
we just want you to love yourself as much as we love you .
and it doesn &apos;t seem like you love yourself too much right now .
that &apos;s why i broke up with mat .
i can &apos;t tell him what i did .
what do i say to callie ?
she &apos;s gonna hate me .
oh , my love . you know what ?
we all do things that we wish we hadn &apos;t .
but we learn from them , and if we ...
manage not to repeat them ...
man , it feels really , really good .
no , thank you . no ! thank you ! thanks !
what are we gonna tell moms ?
i mean , by the time we get home , it &apos;s gonna be so late .
i &apos;ll buy you another keyboard .
it &apos;s not like i need it anyway .
you ever get the feeling like
the whole world is just conspiring against you ?
yeah . i &apos;m pretty familiar with that concept .
wait ! what does that sign say ?
we need passports ?
i thought that we just needed our drive r &apos;s licenses .
well , i guess you were wrong .
no , but when we came in to mexico ,
they just waved us through .
maybe you should &apos;ve done some research before you ...
no ! thank you ! no ! thank you !
no , thank you , sir !
before you kidnapped me and dragged me into another country
for some stupid , illegal adventure .
sure , sure . nothing &apos;s ever your fault .
oh , so , how is this on me ?
don &apos;t worry , it &apos;s not .
no , &apos; cause the whole universe is conspiring against you ,
and you can just blame one of us &quot; dramatic girls &quot;
for ruining your life .
truth is , things were a lot easier before you showed up .
screw you , brandon .
callie !
callie ! callie !
what &apos;re you gonna do , walk home from mexico ?
or maybe you can just call your new boyfriend
to come pick you up , huh ?
what are you talking about ?
just saying ,
there is a new foster brother in the house .
there is nothing going on between me and a.j ..
i &apos;m not blind , callie .
actually , i think you are , brandon .
walking around thinking you &apos;re some victim ?
acting like the world is out to get you ?
you don &apos;t see the drama that you create .
you were the one who turned up to girls united
and got yourself a restraining order .
you were the one who started selling fake ids
that got your hand crushed .
you were the one who plagiarized bach
and then got kicked out of idyllwild . okay ?
if you &apos;re really worried about the drama in your life , brandon ,
look at the common denominator , okay ? it &apos;s you !
can we just go back to the car ?
where is the car ?
you want some dinner ?
i &apos;m pretty beat .
maybe we should order in ? what do you feel like ?
chinese ?
pizza ?
look , i know today was tough ...
you don &apos;t know .
okay .
fair enough .
you wanna talk about it ?
why ?
what you gotta say ?
you gonna tell me how to talk to cops , huh ?
my grandma already schooled me on that , all right ?
&quot; hands on the steering wheel , never resist ...
yes , sir , no , sir . &quot;
&quot; let &apos; em look through whatever you got , and lie down like a dog
&apos;cause you ain &apos;t no better than one . &quot;
don &apos;t say that .
why not ?
it &apos;s the truth !
it &apos;s how a black man gets treated by the cops .
you should know .
i may be a cop , but i &apos;m also your foster father .
no , you ain &apos;t .
okay , well , i &apos;m gonna be .
why ?
we both know this ain &apos;t gonna work .
of course it is .
why are you even doing this ?
i &apos;m trying to help you , a.j. !
you don &apos;t know how to help me , mike !
you got no idea what it &apos;s like to be living down
to the low expectations society has for you .
&quot; foster kid ?
black kid ?
oh ! you must be headed for gangs , drugs , jail . &quot;
i &apos;ve been hearing it so long ,
i &apos;m starting to wonder if they &apos;re right .
they &apos;re not right , a.j. !
and you should stop listening to those people right now !
except there &apos;s a lot more of them and only one of me .
not anymore . now there &apos;s two .
right ?
there &apos;s two of us . come here !
and this cop ...
sees a bright ... talented , decent young man .
this cop &apos;s not gonna let you live down to anybody &apos;s expectations .
you understand me ?
come here !
all you need is someone who believes in you .
someone you can count on and i &apos;m gonna be that person .
you know why ?
&apos;cause i have to believe in a world
where a kid like you gets a real chance .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m doing this , a.j. , okay ?
you didn &apos;t mess up my life , callie . i did .
it &apos;s just ...
easier to blame you for it .
and if i &apos;m being honest ,
i was kinda relieved that idyllwild kicked me out .
if i could blame kat ,
then it wasn &apos;t my fault .
you know ?
you think they &apos;ll give you another chance ?
doubt it .
and honestly , i don &apos;t wanna know the answer , either way .
when we were at the edge of that cliff ...
that &apos;s how it felt every day at camp .
i was so close to something so huge ...
only i was too scared to do something about it .
except today you jumped , brandon .
you jumped .
what &apos;re we gonna say ?
passport ?
hello , officer .
so it looks like we did something really stupid .
thank you .
hola .
they made me tell !
okay , we didn &apos;t mean to ...
you know what ? don &apos;t start , brandon .
it &apos;s my fault .
i kidnapped brandon and took him to mexico .
i just needed to get out of my head
and we ended up getting out of the country .
why ... why mexico ? what did you do ?
we just chilled on the beach .
nothing wild .
we even used sunscreen .
oh , that &apos;s good .
any drinking ?
none . promise .
then how &apos;d you get back into the country with no passports ?
played dumb .
that couldn &apos;t have been hard .
there will be consequences
that we talk about later , but right now ...
brandon , you have a visitor in the kitchen .
sucks to be you , huh ?
look , if this is about what i said ,
about ... you and kat ...
setting me up , i &apos;m sorry .
i really thought that ...
dude , i get it .
kat could drive gandhi to smack a baby ... hard .
but that &apos;s not the reason i drove all the way down here .
how the hell do you make that drive every day , anyway ?
well , that &apos;s one good thing , i guess , i don &apos;t have to anymore .
okay . what if i told you , you might ?
see , i was talking to my pianist , jin ,
and i said what a raw deal i thought you got .
and he said ... if you want ...
he &apos;d be willing to take you on .
so that means i &apos;m back in ?
aw , hell !
hey , oscar .
finished for the day ? how &apos;d it go ?
made some good progress .
good .
all right . well , we &apos;ll see you on monday , yeah ?
uh ... yes . although there is one thing ...
yeah , what is it ?
i have to ask if you can pay me now , in full .
whoa , oscar , wait a minute .
we have a deal ...
a payment schedule . why do you suddenly want ...
look , when couples break up ,
it usually means i don &apos;t get paid
until the lawyers are all done .
what ... why &apos;re ...
... you think lena and i are breaking up ?
why would you ...
look , if you prefer ,
we could talk about an escrow account .
well , as much as it pains me to say it ,
seems like oscar got a lot of work done today .
speaking of home repair ,
i think , um ... i think that you ...
actually have a point .
i do ?
yeah . i was thinking that ...
if you feel that ...
that a third party would help us then , um ...
i guess , i &apos;m up for some couples counseling .
that &apos;s a surprise .
you &apos;re telling me .
what changed your mind ?
honestly , um ...
our new contractor seems to think our marriage is in trouble .
you went hang @-@ gliding ?
are you crazy ?
little bit .
were you scared ?
brandon went , too ?
he was scared though , right ?
way more scared than me .
well , the next time you &apos;re looking for adventure ,
you oughta knock on my door .
a.j ....
callie ...
a.j. , you &apos;re my foster brother . i can &apos;t ...
okay . what about when i &apos;m not ?
