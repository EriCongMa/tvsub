can &apos;t get enough itchy and scratchy !
and now it &apos;s time for ...
another itchy and scratchy ?
who &apos;s the star of this show , me or ... ? !
why is my show all cartoons ? !
and all the movies they &apos;re making fun of
are over a year old .
it &apos;s like those parodies were written
when the movies came out , but it took so long to animate them
that we look dated and hacky .
why can &apos;t we ... ? !
kids , that &apos;s enough tv .
maggie &apos;s eye is starting to wander .
mom , what are you doing ? !
what a rip !
no more tv .
we &apos;re gonna get some fresh air
and visit the museum ... of television .
why can &apos;t we visit a real museum ?
one that doesn &apos;t have the skeletons
of the three stooges in the lobby .
we have to see the museum of tv before next wednesday
when it closes forever .
it &apos;s closing ? !
but where will people find clips of old tv shows
if they &apos;re not housed in a giant building ?
where ? where ? !
ay , caramba !

that was for marge &apos;s eyes only .

if you ever hear a star &apos;s name and wonder , is he dead ?
the answer is either i represent him or yes .
now , let me ask you something : is there a place for
an old @-@ fashioned lard @-@ ass like me on today &apos;s television ?
um , would you play a bloated corpse on csi ?
would i ? !
wow , that &apos;s good bloat work !
he always comes back really religious .
you &apos;re killing me here with this catchy and patchy .
i &apos;m barely on my own show .
today &apos;s kids are uncomfortable with a clown
whose every reference they have to look up on wikipedia .
wikipedia , twitter-- who names these things ?
percy dovetonsils ?
get it ?
come on , he was on ernie kovacs with a smoking jacket ...
krusty ,
we want to make some changes .
what kind of changes ?
krusty , um , this is never easy ,
but you &apos;re fired .
oh , that was easy .
oh , no !
my contract states there &apos;s only one way
you &apos;re allowed to fire me !
yep , everything &apos;s nice and legal !
could this be more awkward ?
they took my dressing room , my parking space ,
even my writer ,
so i don &apos;t have a funny third item .
but at least i got you , my agent and best friend .
krustila , i &apos;m gonna drop you as a friend first ,
so that when i drop you as a client ,
you &apos;ll know it &apos;s only business .
but we shared everything !
boats , girlfriends , condos .
and when i finished , every one of them was spic and span .
krusty , i &apos;m gonna prove that it &apos;s over .
what ? i &apos;m on your garage door opener ?
it &apos;s a smartphone , you out @-@ of @-@ it hack .
little help ?
this only shuts the door .
so , what was everyone &apos;s favorite moment at the museum ?
i liked the knowledgeable docents .
i liked the early closing time .
krusty ?
fate is so cruel .
this morning i was a star , with a top agent .
now i &apos;m strung out in a ball pit !
go away .
no kid should see his hero sunk so low .
well , you &apos;re not exactly my hero .
i see you more as a cautionary tale .
what ? !
i &apos;ll show you who &apos;s a cautionary tale .
i &apos;ll show everybody !
you &apos;re not licked , krusty .
people love a comeback .
look at robert downey jr . , mickey rourke .
米基 · 洛克 美国影星 曾转行做拳击手
i don &apos;t know if i got it in me .
well , people also love a quitter--
sarah palin , the beatles ...
eh , it &apos;s hopeless without an agent .
you need an agent ?
we met a ten percenter today .
字母台 abc电视台
she &apos;ll get you meetings with the eye ,
the peacock , the alphabet web .
you &apos;ll have a skein on the sked before you can say
&quot; krusty &apos;s wardrobe furnished by ha @-@ has of beverly hills . &quot;
a new agent ? !
i better freshen up .
also better get back on those anti @-@ psychotic meds .
请用老虎钳开门
oh , this is a bad sign .
i &apos;ve been to classier gas stations .
i know that laugh !
it &apos;s the laugh of the most ungrateful ,
credit @-@ grabbing ,
other @-@ people &apos;s @-@ room @-@ service- eating man that i ever met .
i will never forgive you for what you did to me .
krusty , you know her ?
she sure knows me
ms. dubinsky , can you please just tell us
why you hate krusty ?
come on in .
it &apos;s a long story .
oh , now i hate him , too .
it was the mid &apos; 60s .
i was a virgin agent ,
looking for a first client or a fourth husband .
and then i saw him .
scary world .
they start with the a @-@ bomb ,
then skip right to the h @-@ bomb .
these geniuses can blow up the planet ,
but they don &apos;t know the alphabet .
i knew he could be big .
he just needed some savvy fingers
to mold his clay into an ali .
牛排煎蛋50美分
herschel , you killed them tonight !
there wasn &apos;t a dry turtleneck in the house .
but mark my words :
the bohemian crowd is small potatoes .
you &apos;re gonna have to broaden your act
if you want to play in peoria .
i don &apos;t want to play in peoria .
they &apos;re always doing construction on highway 74 .
i mean , if you want to hit it big , you got to lose this ...
stick this on ...
and make your comedy a touch more physical .
how do i do that ?
like so .
this is the best kind of comedy of all : cheap !
herschel , you are gonna get everything you want :
money and women ...
there &apos;s only one thing i want :
ice for my ding @-@ dong !
and you .
every night , he had them rolling in the aisles ,
followed by a roll in the hey @-@ hey with me .
this is the part where i get the kids out of the room .
oh , grow up .
today &apos;s kids are less sensitive than an army condom .
they see more on tv than my mother did on her wedding night .
and they don &apos;t complain about it for the next 50 years .
i got big plans for us , krusty .
this is just the beginning .
actually , sweetheart , it &apos;s the end .
i &apos;m leaving you for ron rabinowitz at united parasites .
you waited until now to tell me that ? !
i can only tell the truth right after sex .
but all during sex i was thinking it .
get out !
you ungrateful pig !
i made you !
deep down , i &apos;m doing this to get back at my father .
don &apos;t blame this on me .
your childhood was heaven .
i was so mad at him
i didn &apos;t have sex with a clown for five months .
what about mimes ?
come on . i &apos;m not made of stone .
annie , would you ever consider taking krusty back as a client ?
no ! absolutely not !
trust with me is like a candle .
when you blow it out , it &apos;s gone for good .
what about a comedy candle ?
you know , that relights itself ?
i don &apos;t find those funny , just frustrating .
they &apos;re pretty funny .
once , i used one on milhouse .
he was wishing for his parents to get back together ,
but the flame never went out .
good one , boy .
annie , i &apos;m down on my rebuilt knee .
can &apos;t you forgive me ? please ?
for the sake of me getting what i want ?
fine . but no nonsense .
except , of course , during working hours ,
then it &apos;s all nonsense .
great . so we &apos;re booked
for three weeks in june at the springfield playhouse .
i promise you krusty will show up on time or sober .
yeah , that &apos;s right , i said &quot; or . &quot;
let me get this straight :
you want me to do my kids &apos; show for adults ?
they &apos;re gonna want f @-@ bombs
and all i can give &apos; em is
&quot; ca @-@ ca &quot; and &quot; ta @-@ tas . &quot;
krusty , there is nothing people love more than the things
they loved when they were kids .
so you re @-@ create your show for adults !
it worked like magic for pee @-@ wee herman
after his setback .
what did he get in trouble for ?
that &apos;s all ? !
i did that while you were on the phone !
you know , i &apos;m a little nervous
about doing live theater again .
come on . didn &apos;t you do your tv show in front
of an audience for years ?
yeah , but they were kids and we gave &apos; em candy if they laughed .
and if they didn &apos;t ,
until the &apos; 70s , i hit &apos; em with a stick .
some jerk tracked down the kids and made a documentary .
it &apos;s called circus of shame or something .
and now , let &apos;s welcome a man
the spanish call &quot; senior or no @-@ fun &quot; : krusty the clown !
hey @-@ hey , kids !
hey @-@ hey , krusty !
who here likes nostalgia ?
everything &apos;s perfect about the past
except how it led to the present .
then welcome back the original tick @-@ tock the clock !
would that i could turn back time
and never play this career @-@ killing role .
ooh , looks like tick @-@ tock is telling us it &apos;s time for ...
what &apos;s in krusty &apos;s pocket ? !
i &apos;ve pulled out everything but my little krusty .
aw , what the heck ?
oh , that was great , man !
i feel like i &apos;m ten again !
everything i loved as a kid
and hated as a teenager
i love as an adult !
no one knows better than me
that it &apos;s &quot; here today , gone tomorrow . &quot;
but i &apos;m here today !
thanks to you , honey !
uh , um , sorry ...
this one , i think , is mine .
yeah , i &apos;ll take that ...
i &apos;ll , give me that one .
well , that looks better on you , honey .
yeah . no , no , no , it screams you .
let &apos;s just keep smooching
till everything sorts itself out .
mmm ... i &apos;m done .
krusty , you &apos;re getting the best reviews of your career !
yep ! i &apos;m back on top !
and this time i &apos;m not blowing it on cocaine for my horses .
they start well , then they get paranoid around the third turn .
and you &apos;ll have plenty to invest .
the networks have come crawling .
which ones ? telebozo ?
shtick at nite ? e.s.p.u. ?
better , baby .
our premium cable network is a little different
from what you &apos;re used to .
our brand is classy and upscale .
and we pay for everything with soft porno and boxing .
wait a minute . there &apos;s soft porno ?
and here you don &apos;t have to worry about budgets ,
and the critics are in our pocket .
even the boston phoenix ?
if not , we &apos;ll burn it to the ground !
and that will be the end of that phoenix .
all good . i just have one non @-@ negotiable demand :
this brass begonia here is my producer now
until the end of time .
really ?
yep .
and you know that anything said
at a network pitch meeting can be taken to the bank .
不只是电视节目 是更贵的电视节目
krusty , my man , you finally hit it big .

the entourage actors are now my interns !
i got your coffees , mr. k. !
too hot !
too cold !
genius !
no , no , no !
what , are you crazy ? !
you can &apos;t put a green wall behind
a clown with green hair !
beloved entertainer ...
sad old man !
beloved entertainer ...
sad old man !
he ain &apos;t changing , so everything else in the world has to !
annie , it &apos;s your first day on the set .
scream something nice .
krusty , i am here to serve you and no one else .
&quot; nice &quot; gets booked at birthday parties !
hey , birthday parties got me through some tough times .
for years i lived on pinata candy !
yeah ? well , from now on the only birthday parties
you are gonna do are for the insane sons
of rich middle eastern dictators .
your going rate is 100 barrels of oil .
whoa , that &apos;s beyonce volume .
wait one hairy , banana @-@ peeling , scene @-@ stealing minute here !
wha ... ? what &apos;d i do ?
whose show is this ? huh ? huh ? !
whose name is on that sign ? !
yeah , that &apos;s right , little buddy boy !
krusty ! krusty !
and don &apos;t you ever upstage him
or craft service will be serving chimp tacos !
yeah , i &apos;d like to squeeze a lime on that !
now apologize to krusty !
not so hard .
she &apos;ll know we have a past .
what &apos;s going on , yanking me out of my schvitz ? !
i look like an unwrapped mummy .
ooh ! idea for sketch : rapping mummy .
notorious t @-@ u @-@ t.
it writes itself .
find someone to write it .
where &apos;s annie ?
annie is what we need to discuss .
she &apos;s out of control .
she called a network vice president &quot; unhip . &quot;
and he reads gq
and he &apos;s straight .
and recently we had this incident .
wait ! what are you doing ? !
she claimed this intern
sharpened her pencil &quot; too pointy . &quot;
oh , i see what &apos;s going on here :
if a woman does it , she &apos;s a bitch .
but in a man , those traits would be considered ...
that hallway looks familiar .
i &apos;m only getting college credit for this !
my legs !
wow , i can &apos;t believe we &apos;re in the audience
of a pay @-@ cable show !
and now , ladies and gentlemen , krusty &apos;s favorite part
of the taping : talking to the audience before the show .
hey @-@ how @-@ are @-@ ya @-@ don &apos;t @-@ talk @-@ to @-@ me -the @-@ show &apos;s @-@ starting .
and now ... the clown that never lets you down ...
krusty the ... clown !
hey , hey , premium cable subscribers !
tonight we &apos;ve got the cast of the hit
boardwalk vampire !
we &apos;ve also got janeane garofolo .
wait a minute !
we have very specific language in our contract
saying &quot; no guests who are funnier than krusty . &quot;
janeane has promised to be strictly angry and polemical .
and i &apos;ll keep my promise ,
like obama did with guantanamo .
oh ! that &apos;s funnier than i can ever hope to be !
sorry , janeane . grab some shrimp and go .
you can fill your stupid beret once .
burn on you ! i brought my expandable beret !
krusty , this is exactly the kind of meddling
that only we &apos;re allowed to do .
fire her as we discussed !
don &apos;t make us threaten you .
krusty ? !
what did you tell them ?
oh , i , i did that laugh that people interpret
any way they want .
i thought that laugh meant &quot; i love you . &quot;
it can ...
well , there &apos;s no room for waffling anymore .
you &apos;re with me forever or never .
which is it ?
what , uh , when you said ...
i &apos;m paying extra for this channel ?
hasn &apos;t been good since the wire .
ah , who am i kidding ?
i never watched the wire .
had to bluff my way through so many conversations .
well , annie ,
i think you know my answer .
wow , krusty , adjusting for age , that was amazing !
hey , hey . and the best thing is
i kept my word and i got a new show .
sex over 60 : the mechanics of the impossible . take two !
is it over ? can i open my eyes ?
hey , come on , wake up .
shh ! - oh , grow up !
