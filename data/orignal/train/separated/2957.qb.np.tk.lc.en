barbados .
okay . i &apos;ve gotta say , it means so much to me that you guys are coming ..
all the way over there to hear me give my speech .
and i have a surprise . i had to pull some strings ..
but i was able to get everyone passes to the entire conference . that &apos;s right !
these babies will get you into all the paleontology lectures and seminars .
do you have anything that will get us out of them ?
we &apos;re excited to hear the speech , but the rest of the time ..
we &apos;re gonna want to do island stuff .
david will probably want to hear a few lectures .
right , because he &apos;s a scientist .
no , no .
he &apos;s been in minsk for eight years . if he gets too much direct sunlight ..
he &apos;ll die .
okay , we &apos;d better go .
yeah ?
so we &apos;ll see you guys tomorrow .
all right , let &apos;s do it .
a five @-@ hour flight with charlie , have a couple drinks ..
get under that blanket and do what comes natural .
it &apos;s a blanket , joe , not a cloak of invisibility .
the.one.in.barbados
wow , this place is beautiful !
look at all these paleontologists !
i know . there are gonna be some pasty folks by the pool tomorrow .
my god , i can &apos;t believe you &apos;re here !
i think i &apos;ve been recognized .
this happens all the time .
dr. geller ? i am such a huge fan .
that never happens .
i &apos;ve been following your career for years . i can &apos;t wait for your keynote speech .
wow ! this is very flattering .
i would love your autograph .
well , sure .
&quot; dear .. ? &quot;
sarah .
&quot; sarah . i dig you . &quot;
&quot; dr. ross geller . &quot;
oh , thank you so much .
sure . sarah , i &apos;d like you to introduce you to my colleague , professor wheeler .
and this is joey tribbiani .
are you a paleontologist ?
no , god , no , no . i &apos;m an actor .
you probably recognize me from a little show called the days of our lives .
dude , it &apos;s just days of our lives .
there &apos;s no &quot; the . &quot;
okay , ross . boy , you .. yeah . no , no . i play dr. drake ramoray .
i &apos;m sorry . i don &apos;t own a tv .
you don &apos;t own a tv ?
what &apos;s all your furniture pointed at ?
well , it was a pleasure to meet you all .
you too , sarah .
jeez , who doesn &apos;t own a tv ?
well , actually , i don &apos;t .
yeah , and mine broke two months ago and i still haven &apos;t gotten a new one .
well , didn &apos;t you two come to the right convention .
david , can you help me ?
i &apos;m trying to explain to chandler how a plane stays in the air .
certainly . that &apos;s a combination of bernoulli &apos;s principle ..
and newton &apos;s third law of motion .
see ?
yeah . that &apos;s the same as , &quot; it has something to do with wind . &quot;
i &apos;m gonna go pick up a few things for the trip .
i should go too . now , tomorrow do you want to share a cab to the airport ..
or should mike and i meet you ?
mike ? who &apos;s mike ?
mike &apos;s your ex @-@ boyfriend .
that &apos;s right !
oh , yeah . wow , i had totally forgotten about him .
that &apos;s a blast from the past , huh ?
no , it &apos;s okay . honest mistake .
it really doesn &apos;t mean anything . i mean , you know ..
monica refers to chandler as richard all the time .
she does ?
let &apos;s get you out of here .
well , at least you took me down with you .
i &apos;m so sorry . i just .. i keep thinking about mike .
i &apos;m crazy about david , and we &apos;re having so much fun together .
why ? why do i miss mike ? that &apos;s just .. that &apos;s gonna go away , right ?
well , i guess . in time .
yeah .
i mean , my feelings for richard are certainly gone .
you just did it again . chandler . your feelings for chandler are certainly gone .
boy , phoebe &apos;s still pretty hung up on that mike , huh ?
i wouldn &apos;t read too much into it .
still , a girl calls you by her ex @-@ boyfriend &apos;s name ..
that &apos;s not a good thing , right ?
let me stop you there .
because i think i see where this is going . i &apos;m not very good at giving advice .
see , if you want advice , go to ross or monica . or joey ..
for advice about pizza toppings or a burning sensation when you pee .
i &apos;m sorry , i just wish there was something i could do , you know ?
well , you know phoebe ..
seriously , we &apos;re gonna do this ?
i &apos;m sorry , i just wish i could make her forget about mike already .
why did phoebe and mike break up ?
because his penis was too big .
i &apos;m sorry . that &apos;s the kind of thing i do .
they broke up because mike didn &apos;t want to get married .
what if you let phoebe know you &apos;d be open to marriage ?
that &apos;s great . that &apos;s great . i &apos;ll propose to her .
what ?
i was probably going to do it at some point .
no , i didn &apos;t mean now .
well , why not ? it &apos;s brilliant .
&quot; goodbye , mike . we &apos;ll see you at the wedding , fella .
well , we probably won &apos;t invite you to the wedding , but .. &quot;
well , thank you , chandler . sincerely .
well , you &apos;re welcome .
glad i could help .
how do you think i should propose ?
i &apos;m pretending to read here .
i &apos;m sorry .
yeah . how you doing ? hey , how are you ?
you said you were gonna wear a thong . where &apos;s the thong ?
i didn &apos;t mean a thong . i meant thongs .
you really should have been more clear about that .
you &apos;re never gonna guess who i just saw downstairs .
britney spears !
yeah . she never misses these conferences .
no , i just saw dr. kenneth schwartz !
oh , my god !
i know !
did you talk to him ?
oh , yeah . what am i gonna say to kenneth schwartz ?
you could say , &quot; hey , kenny , how come you &apos;re not britney spears ? &quot;
you ready to go ?
you &apos;re gonna go now ?
i thought we could hang out .
i can &apos;t . i have seminars all day .
i promised ross i &apos;d look at his speech .
but maybe we could have dinner later ? out on the balcony ? it &apos;ll be romantic .
will you wear a thong ?
i will if you will .
you got yourself a very weird deal .
i &apos;m good . i have dinner plans .
so you gonna be okay ?
yeah , yeah .
i got tons of stuff i could do . i &apos;m gonna hit the beach , go swimming .
joe , have you looked outside ?
no . why ?
oh , man .
there &apos;s an indoor pool .
you could swim there .
yeah .
i wasn &apos;t gonna swim . i was gonna dig a hole .
that mike thing was interesting . i don &apos;t know what &apos;s gonna happen ..
with phoebe and david .
i do . want a hint , huh ?
i do .
i do .
okay , i &apos;m sensing this is some kind of wordplay ..
because you are pink with barely controlled glee .
david &apos;s gonna propose to phoebe .
what ? why ?
because we were talking about ways he could beat mike ..
and i told him phoebe wanted to get married .
chandler , we have talked about this .
you are not supposed to give people advice !
couldn &apos;t you have made some inappropriate joke ?
i did !
a penis one !
just so i know , what was so wrong about what i said ?
they &apos;ve only been going out for a few weeks .
phoebe is completely hung up on mike . i mean , she &apos;ll say no ..
david &apos;s heart will be broken , it &apos;ll be too hard for them to recover ..
and then phoebe will end up alone again .
man , that &apos;s some bad advice .
oh , hey . thank god . you guys are here .
what &apos;s going on ?
everything is upside @-@ down here .
it rains all day long and nobody watches tv , and ross is famous .
i don &apos;t want to alarm anybody ..
but monica &apos;s hair is twice as big as it was when we landed .
okay . when i go places with high humidity ..
it gets a little extra body , okay ?
that &apos;s why our honeymoon photos look like me and diana ross .
i &apos;ll show you guys where to check in .
oh , honey ? can you make sure we get a king @-@ size bed ?
oh , david , get one for us too . oh , and see if they have a heart @-@ shaped one .
and with mirrors on the ceiling .
and make sure our room isn &apos;t next to theirs .
oh , you guys are so lucky you &apos;re here with people .
i &apos;d love to share this with someone .
oh , honey , you have us . we love you .
okay , which one of you is gonna sleep with me ?
you know , it &apos;s just such a romantic place .
i just wish i could share it with a guy .
not joey .
not joey . no .
i was just lusting after chandler .
yeah , right .
so .. i &apos;m proposing to phoebe tonight .
tonight ?
isn &apos;t an engagement ring supposed to have a diamond ?
oh , there it is .
yes , well , being a failed scientist doesn &apos;t pay quite as well as you might think .
that &apos;s one @-@ seventieth of a carat .
and the clarity is quite poor .
nice .
monica , can i talk to you for a second ?
okay .
david &apos;s gonna propose to phoebe tonight .
see what happens when you give people advice ?
well , i hope you told him not to .
that would be advice !
okay , fine . i &apos;ll handle this .
phoebe ?
yeah ?
i need to talk to you .
are you leaving the supremes ?
okay , my husband just gave your boyfriend some very bad advice .
david &apos;s gonna propose to you tonight .
wow , really ?
that &apos;s fantastic !
what ? are you serious ? you want to marry him ?
what about mike ?
oh , okay , you want me to marry mike ?
let &apos;s just gag him and handcuff him ..
and force him down the aisle , okay ?
i can just see it . &quot; mike , do you take phoebe ? &quot;
you know ? it &apos;s every girl &apos;s dream .
do you really think marrying someone else is the right answer ?
sure . look , okay , bottom line ? i love mike .. david !
david ! i love david .
don &apos;t look at me that way , roseanne roseannadanna .
&quot; by using ct scans and computer imaging , we can , in a very real way ..
bring the mesozoic era into the 21st century . &quot;
it &apos;s great .
yeah , you really think so ?
you &apos;ll be the hit of the conference .
it &apos;ll be even better tomorrow ..
because i won &apos;t be constantly interrupted by joey ..
checking to see if they put chocolates on my pillow yet .
hey , guys .
the chocolates aren &apos;t here .
damn it !
ross just read me his speech . it &apos;s fantastic .
oh , is it on the computer ? because i &apos;d love to give it a read .
if you want to check your e @-@ mail , just ask .
what ? may i ?
what &apos;s with the rain , geller ? i mean , when i signed up for dino week ..
nobody said anything about it being monsoon season .
the wet season is june to december .
it &apos;s not the time , charlie .
oh , no . no , no ! dear god , no !
what , did someone outbid you for the teapot ?
secret teapot .
your computer . i don &apos;t know what .. everything &apos;s gone .
what do you mean ?
must be a virus .
i think it erased your hard drive .
what ? oh , my god . what did you do ?
someone i don &apos;t know sent me an e @-@ mail and i opened it .
why ? why would you open it ?
well , it didn &apos;t say , &quot; this is a virus . &quot;
what did it say ?
&quot; nude .. &quot;
&quot; pictures of anna kournikova . &quot;
i &apos;m so sorry .
what am i gonna do ?
my speech is gone !
it &apos;s not gone .
i &apos;m sure you printed out a copy . you have a hard copy ?
no , i don &apos;t !
well , you must be pretty mad at yourself right now .
it &apos;s really gone ?
yep .
i &apos;d like to thank you guys for coming down here ..
to complain about the rain and ruin my career .
i just feel awful .
yeah , you should .
nude pictures of anna kournikova ? she &apos;s never even won a major tournament .
well , i tried billie jean king , but ..
you know , you and monica have the same i &apos;m @-@ gonna @-@ kill @-@ you look .
i can usually make it go away by kissing her .
get out .
you know , this happens all the time to my computer at work .
what do you do ?
i usually go ..
play tetris on somebody else &apos;s computer .
i can &apos;t believe this is happening .
i have to give the keynote speech tomorrow .
i have to stand up in front of all these people . what am i gonna say ?
you can use a speech i memorized for auditions .
i don &apos;t think your monologue from star wars is gonna help me right now .
ross , we can solve this . i just heard your speech .
we can re @-@ create it . we &apos;ve got all night .
what , you really think we can do that ?
oh , wait . joey and i are supposed to have dinner .
don &apos;t worry about that . i mean , ross needs you .
rachel and i will stay and help any way we can .
all right . okay , let &apos;s do it .
well , i know we start by discussing the shortcomings of carbon dating .
and then i move on to what is clearly the defining moment ..
of the mesozoic era , the breakup of pangaea . hello ?
and then there &apos;s the overview of the triassic .
any chance any of this happened in a galaxy far , far away ?
hello ?
okay , mike ?
enough is enough . you love phoebe , and she loves you .
so get over your i @-@ never @-@ wanna @-@ get @-@ married thing ..
and step up !
who is this ?
this is monica , phoebe &apos;s friend .
sure , monica . so good to have you back in my life .
listen , phoebe is back with david .
he &apos;s gonna propose , and she &apos;s gonna say yes ..
but i know she really wants to be with you .
he &apos;s gonna propose ?
i &apos;m sorry , did you say something ? i can &apos;t hear through all this damned hair !
if phoebe wants to marry david , she should .
i &apos;m not gonna stand in the way of that . neither should you .
you don &apos;t tell me what to do . i tell you what to do .
just call her . she &apos;s at the paradise hotel in barbados .
and while i &apos;ve got you , you &apos;ve got curly hair .
what do you do in the humidity ?
damn it !
well , i hope you &apos;re happy .
i hope you &apos;re happy too , honey .
phoebe &apos;s going to say yes to david .
that &apos;s what happens when you meddle .
phoebe &apos;s gonna say yes ? that &apos;s great .
no , it &apos;s not . she &apos;s still in love with mike .
there &apos;s no chance that will work ?
no , i called .
it &apos;s not gonna happen .
meddler ! meddler !
if you hadn &apos;t meddled to start with ..
then i wouldn &apos;t have had to go in and meddle myself .
no matter how much we meddle , we &apos;ll never be able to unmeddle ..
the thing that you meddled up in the first place !
this vacation sucks !
i &apos;m so bored .
stupid rain . we can &apos;t do anything .
well , i brought some books . we could read .
hey , it hasn &apos;t come to that yet .
hey , hey , hey , don &apos;t mind if i do .
i &apos;m sorry , sir , these are for the pharmaceutical convention .
you feel like going to a convention ?
we can &apos;t . we &apos;re not pharmacists .
i know we &apos;re not ..
but frank madaio and eva trorro ..
womba
kate miller .
kate miller it is .
okay .
oh , good ..
and that &apos;s the most sex i &apos;m gonna have this weekend .
well , in that case , should i make sure it &apos;s on real good ?
thank you .
so , kate ..
how &apos;s the pharmacy game treating you ?
well , frank , i tell you , it &apos;s rough .
i mean , is it me or is doctors &apos; handwriting getting harder and harder to read ?
i know , i know .
i tell you .
but on the plus side , we get to wear those white coats ..
and stand behind that really tall counter .
oh , that &apos;s true .
you &apos;re joey tribbiani from days of our lives .
finally , someone recognizes me . okay .
and it &apos;s the days of our lives .
jackie , it is him .
yeah , jackie , it &apos;s me . come on over .
oh , my god , this is so exciting !
so why are you here ?
i &apos;m doing research for a role in a new movie about pharmacists .
yeah , it &apos;s called prescription for love .
nice .
yeah .
this is my friend rachel . she &apos;s in the movie too .
i &apos;m an actress .
so , what &apos;s the movie about ?
well , i play the handsome , macho pharmacist ..
and rachel is my student ..
who wants to learn all about ..
pharmacing .
and , see , i &apos;m shy at first ..
but then , i take off my glasses and become sexy , you know .
and there &apos;s some nudity , but it &apos;s very tastefully done .
my nudity in the film is not tasteful at all .
so you &apos;re doing research ?
do you have any questions for us ?
i sure do .
where &apos;d that guy get the big , pink drink ?
oh , and then you said that thing about bringing the mesozoic era ..
into the 21st century .
well , yeah . that &apos;s it ?
that &apos;s it . that &apos;s the whole speech .
yeah .
oh , my god . we did it .
actually , i did it , ross . you remembered shockingly little of your own speech .
yes , but i did make a pyramid out of the bath products .
oh , this is amazing . thank you . thank you so much .
that &apos;s a pretty necklace .
thank you .
hey , what do you say we celebrate ? champagne ?
yeah ! save the cork , and that way , we can fill the bottle with water ..
and put it back so they don &apos;t charge you .
oh , my god , i love you .
this is such a cute picture of emma . and is this your son ..
or just some kid whose picture you bring on vacation ?
that &apos;s ben , my son from my first marriage .
your first marriage ?
yeah .
you &apos;ve been married more than once ?
no .
so why &apos;d you break up ?
oh , it was ..
it &apos;s complicated , you know ? she was ..
gay .
actually , it &apos;s not that complicated .
oh , my god .
this is so cool !
okay . odd thing to get excited about .
no , it &apos;s just that i was engaged to a guy who turned out to be gay .
hey ! high @-@ five !
didn &apos;t you feel so stupid that you didn &apos;t see the signs ?
my fiance was always going on long weekends with his &quot; tennis partner . &quot;
my wife had a workout friend she went to the gym with every day for a year .
she didn &apos;t get any fitter .
everybody &apos;s like , &quot; i knew all along . &quot;
i know .
if you knew , why didn &apos;t you tell me ? i mean , call , leave a note .
&quot; hi . just dropped by to say your wife &apos;s gay . &quot;
i know .
and then ..
and then you try to make the best of a bad situation ..
so you float the idea of a threesome .
i didn &apos;t do that .
me neither .
well , who knew ? pharmacists are fun .
i know . that old lady at the end was ready to take you home .
not enough pills in the world , rach .
what about you , huh ? you &apos;re the single one . see anybody in there you like ?
well , let &apos;s see . there was that really big guy that i was talking to ..
with the really nice breasts .
but what about back home ? anything going on there ? anybody you like ?
no .
there is . you &apos;re blushing .
no , i &apos;m not blushing ..
and i &apos;m sunburned .
from , you know , the rain .
you like someone . tell me who .
tell me who it is . come on .
no . joey .
who do you like ? you &apos;re not getting away that easy .
who do you like ?
joey , come on !
it doesn &apos;t matter , you know ? it &apos;s not like anything &apos;s gonna happen .
what ? why not ? rach , who can you not get ?
okay . okay . you really want to know who it is ?
yeah . who is it ?
do you ?
oh , hey .
i just left you a message .
ross and i were gonna go grab a bite ..
but now that you &apos;re here , we could have that dinner .
right ! of course . hey , did you guys finish the speech ?
yep ! we got it . we got it . thank you so much .
i had a great time .
yeah .
this isn &apos;t over , because i really want to know ..
later . later .
so shall we ?
yeah .
okay .
good night .
good night .
okay , good night .
good night , ross .
i can &apos;t believe she &apos;s gonna say yes to david .
she &apos;s clearly in love with mike .
you know , it &apos;s very hard to take you seriously when you look like that .
could we have a bottle of champagne , please ?
and i &apos;m kind of on a budget , so if you have anything local ..
or canadian .
phoebe , i have something i want to say .
oh , god , he &apos;s gonna do it . i cannot watch this . let &apos;s go .
i think we have time . have you heard him talk ?
&quot; phoebe , i would be honored if .. &quot; spit it out , david !
phoebe .
you &apos;re an amazing woman , and the time we spent apart was unbearable .
of course , the sanitation strikes in minsk didn &apos;t help .
sure . okay . yeah .
but , well , now that we &apos;re together again , i don &apos;t ever want to be apart .
so to that end ..
oh , my god , mike .
it &apos;s david , actually .
no , mike &apos;s here .
oh , hey , mike .
hi , david .
chandler . monic .. oh !
it &apos;s the humidity !
hi , phoebe .
what are you doing here ?
i have a question i need to ask you .
i have a question i was kind of gonna ask her myself .
yeah , i understand , but before you do , she really needs to hear this .
okay .
would you care for my seat as well ?
actually , yeah , that &apos;d be great .
well , that &apos;s fair , you &apos;ve had a long trip .
phoebe , i love you .
i &apos;ve missed you so much these last few months .
i thought we were apart for a good reason ..
but i realized that there was no reason good enough ..
to keep me from spending the rest of my life with you .
kind of steps on the toes of what i was going to say .
i &apos;m sorry , david , but she really has to know this .
all right , but after this , i want to see you outside .
if it stops raining .
you &apos;re the most incredible woman i &apos;ve ever met .
how could i lose you ? now , i don &apos;t actually have a ring .
i have a ring .
i wouldn &apos;t brag about that , big guy .
but , phoebe ..
will you marry me ?
no .
i love you , but i never needed a proposal from you .
i just needed to know we were headed somewhere .
that we had a future .
we can have any future you want .
okay , well , i &apos;m gonna take off .
david , i &apos;m so sorry . i &apos;m sorry .
just so i know , if i had asked first .. ?
yeah , i might have said yes , but that would &apos;ve been wrong .
please , you don &apos;t have to explain .
i mean , perhaps if i hadn &apos;t gone to minsk ..
things would have worked out for us , and i wouldn &apos;t have ruined my career .
or lost that toe to frostbite .
it was a good trip .
is it okay if i hug you now ?
oh , yes .
because of our meddling ! all right ?
oh , isn &apos;t this nice ? it &apos;s so quiet . i could just lie here all day .
oh , i know .
open your drapes ! open your drapes !
so glad we got adjoining rooms .
the sun is out !
hey ! remember when i had corneas ?
go to the pool and reserve chairs .
i will get the magazines and the lotion .
ladies ? ross &apos; speech is in 45 minutes .
no !
damn it !
walls are pretty thin , guys .
&quot; then we have to weigh the data from recent mri scans and dna testing ..
which call into question information gathered from years of carbon dating . &quot;
look at the woman sitting out by the pool getting tan .
she &apos;s all leathery and wrinkled . i &apos;m so jealous !
&quot; finally , factor in the profusion of new species recently discovered .
giganotosaurus .
argentinosaurus . &quot;
not to mention coldsaurus .
&quot; and that &apos;s just the herbivores . i &apos;m not even gonna discuss the carnivores .
their heads are already too big .
which is ironic , considering their stunted cerebral development . &quot;
really ?
&quot; but all kidding aside , in much the same way ..
that homo ergaster is thought to be a separate species from homo erectus .. &quot;
what ?
he said &quot; erectus . &quot;
you &apos;re kidding , right ?
no , he really said it .
&quot; and while there are certainly vast differences ..
between these mesozoic fossils and the example of homo erectus .. &quot;
erectus ?
homo .
right .
&quot; in a very real way , we can bring the mesozoic era into the 21st century . &quot;
thank you .
really great .
oh , thanks , guys .
i thought it was wonderful . jarvis oberblau . cornell .
i mean , the ideas you put forth , and from someone so young and ..
okay , now we &apos;re just holding hands .
alrighty . we &apos;re gonna hit the beach . that was really great .
oh , thank you .
yeah . oh , and so funny .
take it easy .
all right , thanks . thanks so much .
i can &apos;t tell you how much it means that you were here .
you kidding ? we wouldn &apos;t have missed it .
i &apos;m back .
okay . well , excuse me ?
well ?
you were incredible .
you blew them away .
i can &apos;t tell you how great it was to look in the crowd and see your face .
i mean , did you know you were mouthing the words along with me ?
i was not .
no , it &apos;s okay .
it made me feel like a rock star .
oh , my god . i &apos;m your groupie .
hey , i better not find you naked in my hotel room .
look , i took it too far .
hey , i thought you were going to the beach .
it &apos;s raining again .
what ?
would you look at that .
the only time the sun comes out the whole weekend ..
is the one hour i &apos;m giving my speech .
someone up there likes me .
but people down here are pissed .
i can &apos;t believe it &apos;s raining again . it &apos;s so unfair .
well , on the bright side , now we won &apos;t have to see ..
all these paleontologists with their shirts off .
not you guys .
you &apos;ve got it going on .
what will we do today ?
they have a game room downstairs .
they have ping @-@ pong and stuff .
ping @-@ pong ? honey , they have ping @-@ pong .
let &apos;s play .
i don &apos;t think so .
why not ?
you know how competitive you get .
and while i say it &apos;s cute , others disagree , and i &apos;m lying .
i &apos;m not always that bad .
oh , yeah ?
what happened when we played last time ?
i punched you .
and ?
phoebe .
and ?
i clunked your heads together .
there you are .
hey . listen .
as soon as it stops raining , we have got to go snorkeling .
some kid told me about this sea turtle . if you blow bubbles in his face ..
he chases you .
i &apos;m sorry , i can &apos;t . i &apos;m running a discussion group all afternoon .
that &apos;s okay . i &apos;ll find someone else to do it .
i &apos;d do it alone , but ..
i don &apos;t know what happens if the sea turtle catches you .
you know , i feel so bad .
i haven &apos;t seen you this whole trip . especially last night ..
don &apos;t worry about it . it was fine . i had the best time with rachel .
i just felt bad for you , stuck in that room working on ross &apos; speech .
actually , it turned out to be a lot of fun .
oh , well , at least we &apos;re both having fun , right ?
is it weird that it &apos;s not with each other ?
yeah .
a little bit , yeah .
i think we need to talk .
yeah , i think we do .
about what ?
come on , you guys , it &apos;ll be fun !
all right .
i &apos;ll play if we don &apos;t keep score .
well , then how do we know who wins ?
nobody wins .
so we &apos;re just four losers . super .
well , i &apos;m not playing with her .
i &apos;m out .
i &apos;ll play you .

standard rules : if at any time a player uses his nonracket @-@ bearing hand ..
to touch the playing surface , he or she forfeits the point .

okay , dial it up a little .
oh , you &apos;re right . okay .
i just have a question .

what the hell are you doing ?
i &apos;m not trying to do anything .
it &apos;s just , we have such a good time when we &apos;re together , you know ?
and i mean , aren &apos;t you just a little curious what it would be like ?
am i curious ? i mean , i &apos;m as curious as ..
george !
who ?
curious george !
you know , the monkey and the guy with the yellow hat .
of course . i remember .
he had a paper route .
yeah , he did .
see , this is what i &apos;m talking about .
no , i know . we &apos;re great !
but , rach , no , this can &apos;t happen .
can &apos;t it just happen a little bit ?
no ! it can &apos;t happen at all !
why not ?
because , look , no one wants this to happen more than me , okay ?
i have gone over this moment in my head 100 times ..
and not once did i ever say no .
i couldn &apos;t do it to ross .
but that wasn &apos;t gonna stop you before .
i know . i know ..
but i &apos;ve thought about it a lot since then , and it just wouldn &apos;t be right .
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m sorry too .
oh , god , i shouldn &apos;t have said anything .
no , no .
no , no , no , no . hey , we &apos;ll be fine .
like you said , it &apos;s no big deal .
it &apos;s not a big deal .
no big deal .
it &apos;s so not a big deal .
i &apos;ll see you later . all right , hey .
okay , great .
okay ..
oh , i &apos;m sorry , i think .. i think that may have missed the table .
oh , do you ?
yeah .
do you ?
yeah .
do you ?
yeah !
you really find this attractive on him ?
oh , yeah .
are you telling me you &apos;re not even a little turned on by monica right now ?
this is the first time in our marriage that i &apos;ve felt like the more attractive one .
all right , come on , mike . you can beat her .
knock that dog off her head .
damn it !
i sleep with him !
game point .
don &apos;t get too cocky .
remember , i won the last one .
oh , by the way , how did that feel , losing to a girl ?
you should look in the mirror before you call yourself that .
no ! no ! no !
and that &apos;s how it &apos;s done .
okey @-@ dokey .
you &apos;ve each won a game , and i &apos;ve lost what &apos;s felt like a year of my life .
everybody goes home a winner .
best of three ?
that &apos;s what i &apos;m thinking .
should i use my invisibility to fight crime or for evil ?
serve the ball , chump .
&quot; serve the ball , chump . &quot;
okay , better comebacks , mike . better comebacks .
i got it !
i &apos;m fine , by the way !
i &apos;m just saying , i have a cabin in the adirondacks .
if you ever want to get away from the city , well , that &apos;d be ..
just nifty .
well , i &apos;ve kind of got a lot on my plate right now .
not that i wouldn &apos;t love a weekend in the country with a strange man .
jarvis ?
oh , you &apos;re back .
this is my wife , nancy .
well , get out !
ross ? can i talk to you for a minute ?
yes , please .
is he still looking at me ?
yes .
still ?
yes .
and his wife &apos;s kind of looking at me .
so , what &apos;s going on ?
well , joey and i broke up .
oh , my god . what happened ?
joey is a great guy ..
but we &apos;re just .. we &apos;re so different .
i mean , like , during your speech , he kept laughing at &quot; homo erectus . &quot;
i knew that was him !
anyway , i just .. i think it &apos;s for the best .
hey . hey , you okay ?
i guess .
there was ..
there was another reason that i thought it was time to end it with joey .
i started to realize that i was having feelings for someone else .
okay , geller . last day of the conference .
you know what happens to the keynote speaker .
professor klarik , we &apos;re in the middle of a conversation here .
can &apos;t you throw him in the pool later ?
or we could throw you both in now .
okay , gentlemen , please . aren &apos;t we a little old for this ?
i mean , we &apos;re scientists , all right ? we &apos;re academics ..
and most importantly , you will have to catch us first .
go ! go ! go !
okay , so it &apos;s tied again , 41 to 41 .
okay , look , enough is enough .
no .
i just have two more points to beat him .
monica , that was also true an hour ago !
i mean , please , look at you .
your hand is blistered , you can barely stand , your hair is inexplicable !
phoebe , talk to mike . help me out .
mike , you win this , you will get the best sex you &apos;ve ever had in your whole life .
i say to fight crime .
you didn &apos;t see us !
monica ?
you &apos;ve already proven you &apos;re just as good as he is .
we missed our dinner reservations , so let &apos;s just go upstairs ..
order room service , take a shower and shave your head !
i can &apos;t just walk away . i &apos;ve put in four hours .
you knew this about me when you married me .
you agreed to take me in sickness and in health .
well , this is my sickness !
what about the obsessive cleaning ?
that &apos;s just good sense .
you okay ?
no , honey , i &apos;m okay .
shake it off . oh , no shaking . no shaking . no shaking .
oh , my god . i can &apos;t play .
so you forfeit ?
mike wins ?
i can &apos;t believe it . i lost .
no , you didn &apos;t .
what ?
because i &apos;m gonna play for you .
you can &apos;t do that .
it &apos;s okay . i don &apos;t care which of them i beat .
okay , we &apos;re taking that paddle home , mister .
honey , you don &apos;t have to do this .
yes , i do .
i may not understand why you have to win so badly ..
but if it &apos;s important to you , it &apos;s important to me .
because i love you .
but you suck .
you &apos;re welcome , sweetheart .
all right , let &apos;s get this over with . sudden death .
whoever wins this point , wins .
okay .
oh , my god . you &apos;re good .
it &apos;s like watching porn .
and that &apos;s how it &apos;s done .
oh , my god . oh , my god . that was so amazing .
well , when did you .. ?
hold on , i almost forgot . loser .
when did you stop sucking ?
i never sucked . i just didn &apos;t want you ..
to know how good i was .
why ?
i don &apos;t know .
well , this is so great .
now we can enter doubles tournaments .
that &apos;s why .
they still looking for us ?
yeah .
the bartender said they split up into two search parties .
the herbivores and the carnivores .
you know , we , as a group , are not the coolest .
oh , look out .
i don &apos;t think they saw us .
i don &apos;t think they did .
you know , for a bunch of researchers , they sure don &apos;t look very carefully .
so i started to tell you something earlier .
there was another reason that i realized it was time to end it with joey .
i kind of realized i was starting to have feelings ..
for someone else .
and can i ask who ?
i think you know .
i think i know too , but i &apos;ve been really wrong about this stuff in the past , so ..
i &apos;m sorry , we can &apos;t .
all right . all right .
i mean , you just went out with my best friend , you know ?
i just think it would be a really , really bad idea .
or not . i mean ..
