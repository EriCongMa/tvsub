internal affairs
you may think that doing hot yoga after a spin class
is a good idea , but trust me , it is not .
i must be insane .
i &apos;m ben franklin .
your sponsor has told me so much about you .
wait . you &apos;re ben franklin .
don &apos;t you just love how we can be
anyone we want online ?
anyway , your sponsor asked me to check on you
because he , well , now we
are worried about your health .
ok .
no , honey , it &apos;s not ok .
look at you .
you look super stressed to me .
are you stressed ?
maybe a little .
the problem is , you need to be a better manager .
i &apos;m trying .
you &apos;ve only recruited 3 members in 2 months .
now , 5 is the magic number .
when your 5 people each recruit 5 more ,
well , then you can kick back and relax .
i know . i &apos;ll get there .
when ?
next week ?
next month ?
don &apos;t jeopardize your health . you understand ?
now go get &apos; em .
fine .
hi , george .
yeah , i talked to her .
are you sure ?
ok .
yeah . i know what to do .
agent hotchner .
mr. axelrod would like to see you .
please .
axelrod .
thank you , director cochran .
hello , hotch .
you couldn &apos;t just call ?
i could have . we &apos;d still have to meet .
figured i &apos;d cut out a step .
plus , this is more comfortable than a parking garage .
what &apos;s this about ?
a joint nsa @-@ dea investigation into libertad ,
the online illicit drug site ,
has gone south fast .
i heard about it .
yeah , well , one dea undercover agent &apos;s now dead ,
two are missing .
someone in the cartel made them .
it would appear so .
i &apos;d like your team to investigate .
why us ? surely the dea &apos;s got leads .
true . you and your team are better .
what do you really want ?
look , someone gave up those agents .
i have good reason to believe it was
the assistant dea director in charge of the operation ,
bernard graff .
i need you to get the proof .
why not go to the office of professional responsibility ?
it &apos;ll raise some flags .
graff would suspect an internal affairs investigation .
you &apos;re already involved in the darknet with giuseppe montolo ,
so you have the perfect cover .
what makes you think it &apos;s graff ?
he knows technical details beyond the scope of his job .
and there &apos;s a flash drive that never leaves his wrist .
i think it has the access code to the libertad servers .
i did you a favor once .
consider this repayment .
a mole hunt is ill @-@ advised for those
who don &apos;t want to risk their own skins .
it &apos;s an old proverb i just made up .
axelrod asked for my help .
well , in that case , you need to start with a profile .
now , why would a high @-@ level official
be involved with a secret criminal enterprise ?
lure of easy money .
boredom . thinking he &apos;s smarter than everyone else .
fantasy of living a different life .
i assume you want to keep this between us for now ?
yeah .
garcia , are you ready ?
uh , hold on , please .
yes .
see , the blue plays off the sweater .
it &apos;s complementary , but it &apos;s not matchy @-@ matchy .
you &apos;ve been here a week . have you thought about unpacking ?
it might make things a bit easier .
i took my hotplate out &apos; cause i was sick of the cafeteria food ,
but i &apos;m not going to be here much longer
&apos;cause of this new case , huh ?
you guys are going into the belly of the beast .
you &apos;re gonna find out who &apos;s targeting me . am i right ?
among other things .
the darknet--that &apos;s where all montolo &apos;s cronies live .
if anyone can find the answer ,
sir , it &apos;s you guys . i know you can .
the nsa and the dea are both involved ,
so we &apos;ll be part of a joint taskforce .
go ahead , garcia .
ok . uh , 3 weeks ago
undercover dea agent mark bowers disappeared .
he was based in el paso ,
but 5 days ago his body showed up in ciudad juarez ,
just across the mexican border .
ciudad juarez is one of the most dangerous cities in the world .
not only was agent bowers found strangled ,
but he also had another human face covering his own face .
another human face ?
yes . i guess skinned or scalped .
i don &apos;t now what you call it ,
but i couldn &apos;t put the pictures up here .
you can see them on your own tablets .
it is typical for drug cartels to use a corpse to send a message .
yeah , body parts sent to family members .
a face on top of another face
could easily mean he &apos;s undercover or he &apos;s two @-@ faced .
which is bad news for the two missing agents .
they were both undercover .
yeah , john portman vanished a week ago .
and then sarah miles disappeared yesterday .
all of these agents were investigating the libertad drug cartel .
well , if someone knew that they were undercover ,
then there has to be a mole on the inside .
well , we have to consider all possibilities .
this cartel is in fact unique in a few ways .
yeah , it appeared on the
darknet after the silk road was shut down .
it has an online
and an on @-@ the @-@ ground component based in el paso .
it &apos;s run by someone named george washington .
an identity that can be assumed by different individuals .
el paso &apos;s just across the rio grande
from some of the worst drug violence there is .
not a bad place to set up .
yeah , you &apos;re right about that .
i mean , it &apos;d be so easy to fly under the radar
when there &apos;s bigger fish to fry right down the road .
all right . you &apos;ll all head to el paso
and find out what happened to the missing agents .
i will run the cyber part of the investigation from here .
happy hunting .
john ?
john , is that you ?
oh , god .
what happened ?
do you know where we are ?
sarah ?
who are you ?
what do you want with us ?
why are we here ?
&quot; the enemy is within the gates .
&quot; it is with our own luxury , our own folly ,
our own criminality that we have to contend . &quot;
marcus tullius cicero .
sarah miles , one of the missing dea agents ,
has two young children , age 3 and 5 .
i can &apos;t imagine what kind of sacrifices
she had to make to go undercover .
we all do what we have to .
she may have thought the libertad assignment
wasn &apos;t as dangerous as infiltrating
one of the bigger mexican syndicates .
speaking of which , mark bowers , the dead dea agent ,
his body was found 50 yards away from a mass grave
filled with enemies of the sinaloa cartel .
so was disposing his body there
a forensic countermeasure
to throw suspicion on a different group ?
it could be . the area &apos;s been a battleground
for the juarez , gulf , and sinaloa cartels .
plus a lot of smaller gangs and splinter groups are formed ,
all with shifting alliances .
yeah , but why ? why launch a ground operation ?
i mean , isn &apos;t an online platform enough ?
greed and hubris . gotta think like a drug lord .
why have one when you can have both ?
you must be agent hotchner .
yes , sir .
i &apos;m assistant dea director bernard graff .
welcome to the cyber war against drugs .
we could always use the extra help ,
but i &apos;m surprised the nsa pulled you into this .
aren &apos;t you busy hunting psychopaths
who cut up prostitutes or something ?
well , we have a case and there may be some cross @-@ over .
you mean giuseppe montolo and the online hit men .
yes . we &apos;re interested in
whoever the successor to the silk road may be ,
and libertad seems to fit the bill .
well , if you ask me , the nsa &apos;s got it easy .
all they do is monitor and analyze .
but when it comes to putting away the bad guys ,
you and i have to do all the dirty work . isn &apos;t that right ?
no , no .
it &apos;s not related .
are you kidding me ?
my best friend did not just have a hiking accident .
i &apos;m out of here .
simon .
well , he seemed upset .
this is adrienne mitchell ,
our head libertad intelligence specialist .
agent hotchner &apos;s from the bau .
nice to meet you .
the man who just left was our confidential informant simon kahn .
he just learned his friend died .
i &apos;ll give him some space , then we talk to him again .
our specialists have been posing online as buyers and dealers .
we made contact with simon 5 months ago ,
who alerted us to the hybrid nature of libertad .
he &apos;s a tor network relay operator for them .
he wants out but claims he &apos;s not being allowed to quit .
is he being threatened ?
apparently , but we haven &apos;t seen the evidence .
does he know who the head of the cartel is ?
the real i.d. of george washington ?
no . but he does know the number two .
it took months to get him to come in .
he was close to giving us a name ,
but now he &apos;s scared again .
i &apos;d like to get my own analyst on this , if you don &apos;t mind .
she &apos;ll work out of the bau .
by all means .
jake , would you mind showing agent hotchner
where he can set up , please .
yes , sir .
thank you .
thank you .
we need to find out why he &apos;s really here .
they were all posing as buyers .
agent bowers had been undercover the longest at 4 months .
portman went undercover 3 months ago .
sarah miles , 10 weeks ago .
any of them make contact yet ?
we heard from bowers twice ,
once from portman two days before he vanished .
there &apos;s been no direct contact from sarah .
so how did you know they were missing ?
they let us know they &apos;re ok via dead drop ,
leaving a chalk mark at a designated location every 3 days .
all of them missed their check @-@ ins .
ok , now , you said you had contact with two of the agents .
yes , very briefly .
but they passed along useful information .
it seems the ground crew of the libertad cartel
are all customers who get a cut of the profits
if they recruit more customers .
pyramid scheme . that &apos;s innovative .
we &apos;ve i.d. &apos; d some of the lower level members ,
but who we really need to get to is ben franklin .
this individual is the nexus
between the ground operation and the internet .
we think bowers made contact with that person ,
but he was killed before we could follow up .
have you checked in with their families ?
any of them made contact ?
funny you should ask . sarah miles &apos; husband says
there was a hang @-@ up call
from a number he didn &apos;t recognize 3 days ago .
it was the anniversary of his and sarah &apos;s first date .
did you trace the call ?
it came from a bar just outside of town .
if it was sarah , it would be a violation of protocol .
chances are it was a wrong number .
or not .
john ?
don &apos;t give up . we &apos;re gonna get out of here .
think of your family .
tessa .
and the boys .
they love you .
the boys ...
we &apos;re still waiting on the dna results .
i can tell you that whoever did this took his time
in carefully cutting off the face .
so the unsub had special skills .
i wouldn &apos;t go that far .
but to dissect the fascia
and reflect the musculature off the face
takes time and patience .
and this face was placed on top of mark bowers .
a little bit more than that .
the c.o.d. was manual strangulation .
nothing unusual there .
but take a look at this .
this could be a case of stigmataphilia ,
sexual arousal from tattoos or body piercings .
perhaps , but it &apos;s also functional .
in order to secure the skinned face on top of this one ,
the killer needed to find a way to attach it .
was this done postmortem ?
yes .
that means the unsub
spent a lot of time with the dead body .
not the typical m.o. of a drug cartel killer .
this feels like the unsub is getting off somehow
in taking the time to savor his kill .
and we know he likes the wet work .
hi . uh , we &apos;re agents jareau and lewis with the fbi .
we &apos;re wondering , have you-- have you seen this woman ?
she would have been here about 3 days ago .
no .
are you sure ?
she might have been in here with somebody else .
it &apos;s a bar . lots of people coming and going in here .
well , she &apos;s missing , so any information you can give us
will be greatly appreciated .
sorry .
all right . thank you .
oh , i &apos;m sorry . one other thing .
who &apos;s the general manager here ?
i am .
oh , that &apos;s great . because we actually got an anonymous tip
that somebody was skimming off the receipts ,
so we &apos;re just gonna need to take a quick look at your books .
h @-@ hold on .
i thought you were interested in a missing person .
we are . but the fbi also handles federal tax violations .
i mean , you have books , right ?
&apos;cause if you don &apos;t have books ,
we &apos;re gonna have to shut this place down .
can i see that photo again ?
this one ?
ok . yeah , you know what ?
i think i remember her now .
yeah , i--she wasn &apos;t in here very long .
she was talking to a , uh , soccer mom .
soccer mom ?
yeah .
she was cute , like you .
oh . thanks .
axelrod said you were a real straight arrow .
like eliot ness reborn .
is that your dad ?
yeah .
that &apos;s my dad .
he was in the dea , too .
his father , my grandpa , was a g @-@ man .
it makes you all wonder , doesn &apos;t it ?
about what ?
if what we &apos;re doing really matters .
in the end , we &apos;re all just government employees , aren &apos;t we ?
after we &apos;re gone , someone will take our place .
new criminals replace the old .
make you want to give it all up for a different life ?
i know why you &apos;re really here .
hornet .
most people aren &apos;t aware
there are multiple darknets .
tor network is just one of them .
there are over two million users on tor ,
which is slowing it down , making it too vulnerable .
a lot of operations are jumping ship
to other darknets , like hornet .
you think libertad will ?
probably .
but i bet giuseppe montolo &apos;s hit men have already moved .
you &apos;re here because you think
we have undercover access to a hornet router .
do you ?
no . we &apos;re still working on it .
so your presence here is premature .
excuse me .
yeah , dave .
yeah , keep me posted .
thanks .
my team have found evidence
of a serial killer working in the el paso area
using the drug violence as a cover .
well , it &apos;s a good thing you &apos;re on this case , then , isn &apos;t it ?
what do you want with us ?
you leave her alone .
what are you doing with him ?
where are you taking--
answer me !
john !
oh , no !
it &apos;s , uh , agent john portman .
his face is , uh , missing .
i &apos;m sorry .
he was a good man .
the coroner said he was in bad shape .
he was severely dehydrated
and had evidence of electrical burns .
so he was held and possibly tortured .
any significance to this area ?
you mean like a mass grave nearby ?
no .
agent lopez ?
excuse me .
that means the unsub &apos;s given up on a forensic countermeasure .
it could be border control &apos;s tighter ,
or he &apos;s just getting more bold and careless .
one victim was found in mexico , the other one here .
where &apos;s his home base ?
well , given how much easier it is for an american
to go back and forth across the border ,
i &apos;d put my money on el paso .
we need to deliver the profile .
yeah .
we &apos;re looking for an american serial killer
who &apos;s trying to hide amid all the drug war violence .
his most recent victims ,
all undercover dea agents ,
were investigating the libertad drug cartel .
his postmortem work on his victims
requires both patience and diligence ,
suggesting he &apos;s in his mid @-@ thirties or older .
he may have a history of mental illness and hunting skills ,
based on the dissection of those victims &apos; faces .
this serial killer likely had victims
prior to the death of the dea agents ,
and those bodies were in all likelihood
hidden amongst the numerous drug cartel targets .
the killer knew our agents were undercover ,
so it has to be someone from inside the cartel , right ?
well , since anyone could join libertad ,
the unsub could be a member , but it &apos;s not the only choice .
someone on the inside could be aware of the unsub &apos;s predilection
and has been funneling new victims his way .
that person may have discovered the victims &apos; true identities
or responded to an anomaly in the recruiting pattern .
it is possible that the dea agents were having a
difficult time hitting their recruitment numbers .
john portman has provided a face for the unsub .
we need to move quickly to save sarah miles
from being the victim who wears that face .
the first dead dea agent may have known who the
nexus was between the internet and ground operations .
did you figure graff out yet ?
no . but something &apos;s definitely wrong .
i &apos;ll talk to you later .
i thought you should know i &apos;m having the ground investigation
into libertad suspended for now .
i understand .
you know , i &apos;ve been wondering .
instead of looking for montolo &apos;s hit men ,
have you tried looking for the dirty dozen ?
did axelrod tell you about that ?
aren &apos;t we all sharing information here ?
we got a problem . simon kahn , our c.i. ,
is dead .
his car exploded outside his apartment .
he was coming to meet me .
john ?
he ... didn &apos;t kill me .
oh , wait . yes , he did .
he begged me not to hurt you .
to let you go because you &apos;re a wonderful person , he said .
oh , please ...
so i tried to feel what he felt for you ,
but to be honest ...
i didn &apos;t feel a thing .
agents . dna results are back from the m.e.
it appears the skinned face on the first victim , agent bowers ,
belonged to arvin cole ,
repeat drug offender , with multiple arrests
for possession of cannabis and pcp .
is he a part of libertad ?
it &apos;s hard to tell .
well , any drug addict would be a good candidate for libertad .
ok , so arvin cole is the one victim we know of
who wasn &apos;t a dea agent .
maybe he knew the unsub personally .
hey , baby girl , i need you to look into something for me .
tell me it &apos;s your melted chocolate eyes ,
because i &apos;m so there .
likewise , but first things first , silly girl .
find out everything you can on an arvin cole .
he &apos;s a repeat drug offender from el paso .
got it . ooh ! i need to tell you something that i found .
there was a serial killer investigation
among the drug cartel chaos that started back in 2011 .
by whom ?
a detective morales
of ciudad juarez police department .
what &apos;d he find out ?
4 bodies over the course of 6 months were found ,
all with their faces removed ,
and the conclusion was it was probably a calling card
to a new street gang .
ok , and now where is this detective now ?
he &apos;s deceased .
he had a brain tumor in mexico city a year ago .
well , did anyone follow up on the investigation ?
no . but detective morales sent his report
to the el paso police department
in case there were any similar victims
on the american side of the border .
except there weren &apos;t any until john portman .
all right , thanks , garcia .
ok , i &apos;ll hit you back when i have something .
this is hotchner .
it &apos;s graff . we need to talk . it &apos;s urgent .
meet me at the raleigh hotel bar . i &apos;m heading there right now .
what a mess .
it looks like suicide .
is that his weapon ?
yeah .
he had just called me to meet him .
about what ?
he didn &apos;t say .
he must have known you were about to expose him .
i didn &apos;t have anything .
you find the flash drive ?
it wasn &apos;t on him .
i &apos;m sure he felt you were getting close .
paranoia probably got the best of him .
so where does that leave us ?
we &apos;ll tear apart his life ,
figure out who the other players in libertad are
and bring it down .
but as for the missing dea agent ,
i trust your team will find her soon .
thanks for your help on this .
we need to talk .
graff didn &apos;t kill himself .
i know . the question is , who did ?
the mole .
what do you know about a mole ?
graff told me months ago .
he &apos;s the one who alerted the nsa
that an insider might be running libertad .
and you and graff thought it was me ,
that i came to tie up loose ends .
yes , but then graff said it wasn &apos;t you ,
when you were genuinely surprised
that libertad might leave the tor network .
do you have the flash drive ?
he gave it to me for safekeeping .
he said he found something new .
graff was storing evidence against the mole .
it looks like someone requested a police investigation file .
someone from the nsa .
hey , what do you have , penelope ?
i have gone through the phone and e @-@ mail records of arvin cole ,
the pothead and pcp user .
i can say without a shadow of a doubt
that all of his friends are real high
on the skeevy and burnout spectrum .
except for one .
and who &apos;s that ?
jillian carter . she looks like a regular soccer mom .
she has 3 kids .
he talked to her on the phone twice
the day before he vanished .
soccer mom , you say ?
the epitome of one .
she ran a bake sale for her team and everything .
i &apos;ve just sent you her photo .
this could be who the bartender was talking about .
garcia , we need jillian &apos;s address .
oh , i can do one better . i &apos;m tracking her cell phone .
she &apos;s 5 blocks away . 220 mason .
climb on up .
jillian carter .
we &apos;re with the fbi .
the libertad cartel ?
is this a joke ?
this is not a joke .
listen , i &apos;m here voluntarily ,
and i appreciate everything the fbi does for our country ,
but do i really look like a drug dealer to you ?
you &apos;d be surprised .
you &apos;ve been positively i.d. &apos; d as the woman
talking to a missing dea agent in an el paso bar .
who i.d. &apos; d me ?
we also know you had contact with arvin cole ,
a known drug offender .
we have his phone and email records here .
you spoke with him twice 3 weeks ago .
the following day , all of his outgoing calls and emails stopped
because presumably he was dead .
that &apos;s a mistake .
it &apos;s an old phone number .
i donate all my old cell phones ,
so someone must have used it
and it was still registered in my my name .
easily enough to solve that .
we &apos;ll just pull up the audio record
from our friends at the nsa .
request set .
whatever you find ,
you can &apos;t prove it was me on the phone .
there &apos;s voiceprint recognition .
that &apos;s not foolproof .
see , my husband &apos;s owen carter .
he &apos;s one of the biggest corporate attorneys in the state .
so you &apos;re not part of libertad for the money .
then why do it ?
i &apos;m guessing it started as a simple addiction
to painkillers or benzos .
that you were a bored housewife
and libertad tapped into
your hidden ambition and business skills .
my husband &apos;s gonna have a field day with you .
hotchner .
graff didn &apos;t kill himself .
it was graff &apos;s gun . there was residue on his glove .
they weren &apos;t his gloves . they were too big .
he was very meticulous .
ok .
he was set up .
do you have proof ?
not beyond his dead body and the urgent call he made to me .
all right , so my hunch was off .
partly .
the head of libertad is definitely an insider .
and the evidence points to you .
i &apos;m going to give you one chance to come clean .
if it is you , make no mistake , i will take you down .
do you recognize that number ?
no .
but it &apos;s an nsa prefix .
someone called simon kahn from this number
a half an hour before he was killed .
it could have come from any nsa office . it wasn &apos;t me .
a year ago , someone from the nsa
requested a file transfer from the el paso police department .
it was about a serial killer investigation that started in mexico .
this came from an onsite server .
it means whoever requested this
was in fort meade december 2 , 2014 .
i wasn &apos;t even in the country .
i was in france at my niece &apos;s wedding .
would you like to see the photos ?
who tipped you off about graff ?
my boss .
right now agents are searching your house ,
confiscating your computer .
go ahead . they won &apos;t find anything .
just means my kids can &apos;t do their homework now .
your kids looked healthy and happy .
i gotta say , you seem like a good mother .
i am .
you think they &apos;ll agree when you &apos;re in federal prison ?
i &apos;m a white woman with no prior record .
i serve on 3 charity boards .
no jury will ever put me away .
do you want to take that chance ?
yeah , i can &apos;t imagine having a convicted felon for a wife
will be a good thing for your husband .
but he doesn &apos;t know about your secret life , does he ?
which is why you haven &apos;t bothered to call him yet .
i &apos;ll tell you what .
why don &apos;t we call him for you .
that is owen carter , right ?
what do you want ?
we know you &apos;re the nexus between libertad &apos;s ground
and internet operations . who is your contact ?
george washington .
i don &apos;t know his real name .
if you had any concerns about someone , what would he do ?
he &apos;d tell me to give them specific instructions to meet again .
they were supposed to
take the local bus number 8 to the last stop ,
esperanza valley .
and then ?
i don &apos;t know .
i never showed up to those meetings .
well , this is charming .
last bus of the day .
good place for a serial killer to pick up any stragglers .
this must be a stop for migrant workers .
probably get dropped off here and then shuttled to farms
throughout the valley .
it &apos;s not harvest season right now .
the store &apos;s closed .
hey , mama , listen , i need you to find the owner
of the diablo general store in esperanza valley .
okey dokey .
uh , looks like that store has been owned
by the dufour family for 60 years ,
currently managed by jacob dufour .
it &apos;s closed in the winter months .
wait , garcia .
garcia , you &apos;re cutting in and out .
i got a bad cell signal out here . hello ?
hello , can you hear me ?
yeah , yeah , i got you .
look for residents in the immediate area with sketchy histories .
incarceration--
uh , you &apos;re cutting out , too ,
but i think i get the drift of what you &apos;re saying .
garcia .
call me back .
i got cut off .
probably the last pay phone left in the state
and it doesn &apos;t work .
all right , i &apos;m gonna try back up the hill ,
see if i can get a better signal .
i &apos;ll check out the nearby neighbors , see what they know .
you &apos;re about to get some company .
hey , baby girl .
where have you been ? i have been calling and calling .
calm down . calm down . i &apos;m here now .
well , i didn &apos;t want you to
go try to talk to a neighbor or go to a farm .
then you &apos;d run into jacob dufour himself .
why ? what do you got on him ?
oh , i have a boatload of crazy .
he has a history of mental
illness and animal cruelty since he was a teenager .
in and out of psychiatric hospitals .
apparently he would cut the
heads and the pelts off of various animals
and he &apos;d wear them , and said he wanted to know
what it felt like to be in someone else &apos;s skin .
garcia , where does dufour live ?
the farm closest to the store . and keep me in the know .
i want to be sure of you guys .
all right , thanks , mama .
howdy , ma &apos;am .
can i help you ?
you live here ?
sure do . name &apos;s jacob dufour .
i &apos;m the owner of the farm .
and you are ?
special agent tara lewis of the fbi --
you all right ?
fine . fine . just go .
go !
help me .
please ...
please help me .
it &apos;s ok . it &apos;s ok . it &apos;s ok .
you &apos;re gonna be all right .
you &apos;re all right .
i &apos;ve got you . i &apos;ve got you .
don &apos;t leave me , please .
i &apos;ve got you , i &apos;ve got you . i &apos;ve got you .
oh , please .
agent hotchner .
this is a surprise .
director cochran .
my team found the serial killer
responsible for murdering the drug enforcement agents .
his name is jacob dufour .
excellent .
i envy the work the bau does .
it must be so satisfying .
dufour wasn &apos;t working alone .
he had a helpful partner
putting the victims into his hunting zone .
dufour didn &apos;t even know they were dea agents .
who was the partner ?
you .
me .
and how is that possible ?
in 2011 there was a local investigation
into a serial killer who
was taking advantage of the drug violence .
you requisitioned a file
and figured out how the killer was operating .
i applaud your thoroughness , but this is really unwarranted .
there &apos;s $ 5 million in bitcoin in a panamanian bank account
that we have traced back to you .
well , this is clearly a setup .
axelrod , tell him . tell him .
take him .
do you mind if we borrow your pen ?
something tells me the access
codes to the libertad servers are in there .
wait . agent hotchner --
you &apos;re under arrest on multiple counts of racketeering
and conspiracy to murder a federal agent .
this is a mistake !
you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re doing !
i could use a drink .
how about you ?
sure .
you know , hotch , as long as you don &apos;t threaten
to take me down again , i think we could actually be friends .
so libertad &apos;s been completely shut down .
yes , but all of its competitors are stepping in as we speak .
how &apos;s garcia doing ?
she &apos;s disappointed she can &apos;t go home , but she &apos;s doing ok .
i &apos;ll bring her a new garden troll
to cheer her up when i get back .
that &apos;s a good idea .
i &apos;ll talk to you soon . bye .
am i right ? you doing all right ?
well , uh , i don &apos;t really have a choice , do i ?
no .
well , then , yes , i am hunky dory .
i am . i &apos;m , um ...
i &apos;m gonna put some satin sheets on that ,
i &apos;m gonna put a splash of color over there .
i &apos;m gonna put some tassels on that thing .
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m so sorry .
i know . it &apos;s all right .
but it &apos;s not gonna be forever .
and ...
you got cochran .
true .
and he lawyered up , but he could talk at some point ?
he could .
ok .
hey , i &apos;m gonna make myself a vegetarian omelet
for dinner . do you want one ?
well , uh ...
jack &apos;s already in bed , so ...
you have jalapenos ?
i &apos;m sorry .
um , do -- do i have ja --
i want you to know ,
i have had a love affair with all things hot and spicy
since i was like 12 .
oh , my gosh . green peppers .
