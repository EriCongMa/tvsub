here goes . and , uh ,
this is the part i always leave out .
i had missed my curfew the second time that week ,
and when i got home , it was crazy late .
it was like 3 : 00 in the morning ,
and my parents weren &apos;t home ,
and the phone rang ,
and my life stopped .
my parents were killed by a drunk driver
when they were out looking for me .
and if they hadn &apos;t been out looking for me , then ...
we all have wounds that we want to heal .
that &apos;s why we come here every week , right ?
and i have to believe that as we keep coming here
and talking and revealing ,
that eventually , in time ,
even the deepest wounds we carry wil begin to heal .
monica , is there something you want to say ?
sorry .
but i believe that time ...
wears you down .
a few weeks ago ...
i walked by the bakery that we used to go to ...
and i saw this ... little girl with blond pigtails .
i &apos;m sorry . i can &apos;t .
don &apos;t be sorry . it &apos;s totally ok .
that &apos;s why we &apos;re all here .
i think that &apos;s enough for tonight .
i &apos;m going to wrap it up . ok ?
thank you all for coming .
i look forward to seeing you next week .
hey , mon , what &apos;s the rush ? i thought you wanted to talk to me .
it &apos;s all right . it &apos;s just been a long week .
yeah , it &apos;s only monday . what &apos;s going on ?
yesterday was the anniversary of hope &apos;s disappearance .
oh , god , that &apos;s ri--
i &apos;m so sorry . i for-- why didn &apos;t you say something ?
i didn &apos;t want to relive it with the group .
once was enough .
ok , i totally understand .
do you want to grab a late dinner and talk ?
no , i &apos;m good . you go enjoy .
i promise , we &apos;ll talk later .
are you sure you &apos;re ok ?
yeah .
dear mommy , please don &apos;t tell the police .
if he finds out i &apos;m writing you ,
he &apos;ll kill me .
i see you got one of those , too .
what ? ! that &apos;s hope .
oh , my god .
who put this here ?
i saw a man and a young woman putting them on cars .
well , they-- well , where did they go ?
did you see what they looked like ?
they were headed out of the parking lot by the time i saw them .
wait ! they couldn &apos;t have gotten far . we &apos;ll take my car .
it &apos;s right here .
come on .
ok . ok , so wait . so you &apos;re saying
it &apos;s literally just doubling up on the flour ?
exactly .
oh , god , that &apos;s genius .
ok , it won &apos;t be a molten mass next week , i promise .
i &apos;ll see you next week .
see ya .
what about those two ?
no , it &apos;s not them .
what about them ?
to be honest , i think we might have missed them .
no , i need to find them .
i can &apos;t imagine how hard yesterday was for you .
what ?
i &apos;ll bet since you got that letter ,
you &apos;ve read it a hundred times .
how do you know about the letter ?
&apos;cause i &apos;m the one who took hope .
&quot; hope is faith holding out its hand in the dark . &quot;
george iles .
i understand , ma &apos;am , but again , we can &apos;t yet treat this
as a missing persons case .
clearly something happened here .
officer , i can take care of it from here . thank you very much .
so , any word ?
no . i just-- i have this feeling .
and that officer wouldn &apos;t listen , and i--
penelope .
i believe you . i do .
but i need you to keep
your head in the game right now . you hear me ?
yeah , ok , i &apos;m sorry . right .
ok , i &apos;m here . i &apos;m right here .
is there any chance monica left with someone ?
no . no , not today .
yesterday was the anniversary of her daughter &apos;s abduction .
how long have you known her ?
5 years .
and her daughter was abducted . did they catch him ?
no . the case went cold .
the police ran down all kinds of leads . no dice .
garcia , you do know the effect
anniversaries can have on survivors , right ?
are you insinuating that she might have killed herself ?
she didn &apos;t . i know her . she &apos;s a survivor . she wouldn &apos;t do that .
it looks like she left in a hurry .
the keys are still in the ignition .
and she left her purse .
what &apos;s that ?
it &apos;s a letter , signed by somebody named hope ?
that &apos;s her daughter .
what do you mean , you took hope ?
haven &apos;t you always wanted to know what happened to her ?
of course i do . where is she ?
well , it &apos;s important that you understand how it all began .
why are we here ?
answer me .
ok , just tell me where she is .
i won &apos;t call the police , i swear .
of course you won &apos;t , because doing that
would guarantee you &apos;ll never see her again .
you recognize this place ?
we used to stop here for gas on the way home .
it &apos;s also the first place i met hope .
you wouldn &apos;t buy this for her .
do you remember how upset she was ?
mommy , please .
please , mommy .
i believe your exact words
were , &quot; what part of no do you not understand ?
go put it back . &quot;
i didn &apos;t want her to ruin her dinner .
she made a choice not to take candy from a stranger .
no , thank you .
and in that moment ,
i made a choice , too .
i had to have her .
where did you take her ?
we all make choices , monica .
you can choose to walk out that door
or you can come with me .
take me to my baby .
i got you something .
it &apos;s still her favorite .
garcia , i &apos;ll do the case presentation .
oh , no , sir , i can do it .
i got it .
thank you , sir .
no problem .
7 years ago yesterday at manassas , virginia ,
8 @-@ year @-@ old hope kingston was abducted from her front yard
while playing with a friend .
she &apos;s been presumed dead .
a few hours ago , her mother monica
disappeared from a parking lot
after attending garcia &apos;s victims support group .
it &apos;s not uncommon for unsubs
to reach out and contact relatives of victims .
joran van der sloot extorted $ 25,000
from natalee holloway &apos;s mother
in exchange for information .
do we think both abductions were related ?
i found a letter signed by hope inside monica &apos;s car .
the anniversary could have been the trigger .
we can &apos;t rule out the possibility
that monica committed suicide .
no . no , monica would-- would never hurt herself .
she--she still thought hope was alive .
is the father in the picture ?
no , he died in a car accident
right before hope was born .
there &apos;s no postmark ,
which means this letter was obviously hand @-@ delivered .
you do a full linguistic analysis .
we need to determine authenticity .
there &apos;s a butterfly drawn next to hope &apos;s name .
that has to mean something .
there was no sign of struggle at the scene .
what if she went willingly ?
he could have approached her and had hope with him .
that would certainly get her attention .
still , it &apos;s pretty high @-@ risk
to abduct in such a high @-@ traffic area .
the parking lot was right next to a strip mall .
any witnesses ?
i was the last person that saw her .
unless we have reason to believe otherwise ,
we should assume that the same unsub is responsible
for both abductions .
let &apos;s get started .
why did you bring me back here ?
to show you how her life with me began .
it brings back a lot of memories , doesn &apos;t it ?
you followed us home .
she used to run around for hours . remember ?
like a ...
young butterfly floating in the wind ,
just a vision of beauty .
no peeking this time .
ready or not , here i come !
i got so wrapped up in watching them ,
i almost forgot why i was there .
monica .
we all have choices , remember ?
i thought that was you .
everything all right ?
yeah . uh , we were just driving by .
at this time of night ?
i didn &apos;t--i didn &apos;t realize how late it was .
you sure you &apos;re all right ?
yeah , i &apos;m fine . we were just leaving .
it &apos;s rare that parents of a missing child
would leave the home they shared .
from what garcia said , she didn &apos;t have a choice .
she focused her resources on finding hope .
the mortgage took a back seat .
but she still wanted to
stay close to the home she shared with hope .
so she moved to an apartment nearby .
lights are on a timer .
yeah , in case hope came home .
which means there &apos;s probably ...
a key under the mat .
that &apos;s risky for a single woman , leaving a key out like that .
if he stalked her , he would have had complete access to her here .
but he waited and abducted her in public .
the same way that he took her daughter .
so this letter monica allegedly received from her daughter
contains no indication of female authorship .
it lacks expression of emotional attachment .
the unsub wrote it ?
i believe so . the language used is inconsistent
with that of a 15 @-@ year @-@ old held in captivity for 7 years .
uh , i just got a hit on someone who matches monica &apos;s description
at a gas station 17 miles outside of manassas .
hope &apos;s not with him .
it looks like they &apos;re having a conversation .
she &apos;s cooperating . garcia , can you get any closer ?
no . no , i can &apos;t get a good look at him .
look at his body language .
he &apos;s shielding himself from the cameras .
he knows where they are . he &apos;s protecting his identity .
why isn &apos;t monica from theasking for help ?
she doesn &apos;t want to draw attention to herself .
she leaves , but the unsub stays ?
i don &apos;t understand .
he &apos;s got complete control . he &apos;s not worried
about her contacting the authorities .
garcia , run the pump receipts against the timeline .
maybe he used a credit card .
pumps one ... through 9 .
nothing . who goes to a gas station and doesn &apos;t buy anything ?
there are plenty of service
stations between the community center and here ,
but he drove her clear across town .
this place must mean something to the both of them .
this could be where it all started .
here we are .
home sweet home .
i pass by this street every day on my way home from work .
7.2 miles door to door .
i can &apos;t believe you &apos;ve had her here this whole time .
oh , my god .
oh , my god .
i love that picture of hope . she &apos;s so photogenic .
i need to see her .
it &apos;s getting late .
i &apos;ve done everything you &apos;ve asked .
come with me .
anything ?
she was there , but we just missed her .
the owner of monica &apos;s old house reported
seeing her parked outside just 2 hours ago .
was the unsub with her ?
yeah , but he didn &apos;t get much
of a description on the unsub or the truck .
he did say monica had been by a lot recently .
apparently somebody dropped a letter for her a week ago .
the owner called her to come pick it up ,
and ever since then she &apos;s been parked outside the house .
what &apos;s this guy doing with her ?
if he &apos;s had hope captive for 7 years ,
she &apos;s completely compliant by now .
he might have abducted monica as a reward for good behavior .
or he could be getting off on the fact
that he successfully abducted a mother and a daughter .
monica &apos;s statement the day of hope &apos;s abduction
confirmed that she made a purchase at the same gas station
hours before hope went missing .
it &apos;s not a coincidence that he brought monica
from that particular gas station to her old house .
he &apos;s taking her through all the steps of hope &apos;s abduction .
having both of them could have been his plan all along .
so are we saying he &apos;s sexually diverse ,
attracted to children and adults ?
the unsub stalked monica ,
so he knew about the spare key under the mat .
he had complete access .
so why wait 7 years to circle back if that &apos;s the case ?
the butterfly could symbolically represent
not just transformation but maturation of his erotic ideal .
well , he started with easy targets .
children are much easier to abduct , manipulate , and control .
or he could be a preferential offender
and a situational child molester , meaning adult woman have always
been his preference , but given the right circumstances
he &apos;d offend against a child .
monica &apos;s not a preference .
she &apos;s a specific target .
he didn &apos;t go after just any woman ,
he went after hope &apos;s mother .
which means that hope is probably dead
and he &apos;s taken monica because she reminds him of hope .
this is everything the manassas p.d. had on hope &apos;s investigation .
all right , let &apos;s get to work .
wait , please !
rise and shine .
how did you sleep ?
i didn &apos;t .
oh , hope grew out of those when she was 12,
but i didn &apos;t need to use them on her much after that .
so i have water , orange juice ,
milk--
she &apos;s not here , is she ?
why would i bring you here if that was the case ?
then prove it . i want to see her !
go ahead .
have a look .
hope .
sorry , bill . i &apos;ll do it better next time .
so , what &apos;s the word , genius ?
i may have been able to narrow down the unsub &apos;s comfort zone .
the gas station was the third
point i needed to complete the geographical profile .
factoring in monica &apos;s abduction site and her apartment ,
i would assume the unsub lives somewhere within this area .
that would make it easier for him to learn her routines .
that zone can &apos;t be more than 20 miles .
all right , so all the local employees
that were on duty last night checked out .
nobody saw a thing .
you know , it looks like there are 5 different
reported incidents that
we might be able to attribute to this unsub .
when was the first case reported ?
6 months before hope &apos;s abduction .
a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl in the area reported a man
taking pictures of her on her way home from school ,
and 3 weeks after that ,
she thought he was peeping into her window .
and then her house was burglarized ,
and the only thing that was missing were her clothes .
well , if that &apos;s him ,
then there was a clear escalation in his m.o.
he was building his confidence to abduct hope
and then 7 years later , monica .
hey , uh , these were found on heather wilson &apos;s bike
2 weeks after hope disappeared .
that &apos;s the girl that hope was playing with when she was abducted .
the butterfly again .
&quot; without you , she wouldn &apos;t have been set free .
this is a token of my appreciation &quot; ?
he sent a thank @-@ you card to the girl he didn &apos;t abduct .
this is what i saw .
she was--she was here .
she was just here .
she wrote you so many times .
where are you hiding her ? !
&quot; dear mommy , why don &apos;t you come see me ? i miss you . &quot;
go to hell !
anger &apos;s how you &apos;re dealing with your guilt .
hope !
hope was angry at first , too .
hope , if you &apos;re here , say something ! mommy &apos;s here !
you want to know how i got her to calm down ?
we used to play a lot of games .
what are you doing ?
go ahead , i &apos;ll give you a head start .
1 ...
2 ...
3 ...
heather ? i &apos;m agent jareau .
this is agent prentiss . we &apos;re with the fbi .
we have some questions about hope kingston .
do you remember her ?
what do you think ?
i know you &apos;ve been through this before ,
but we need to talk to you about that day .
heather , we have reason to believe that the same man who took hope
abducted her mother last night .
this can &apos;t be happening again .
did you and hope play together often ?
every day . she was like a sister .
you told the police
that you saw a man watching you guys play that day .
look , i &apos;ve been through this a thousand times .
i wish i could help you more ,
i really do , but i gotta get to class now .
you put streaks in your hair because it &apos;s a constant reminder
of how much you two looked alike .
you don &apos;t know anything about me .
i know that you struggle to let people in
because you &apos;re afraid of losing them .
and that you are constantly asking yourself
why he took hope instead of you ?
are you done ?
listen , if there &apos;s something that you know ,
please tell us .
it wasn &apos;t the first time i had seen him .
it was a week earlier when hope and i were at the park .
did he say anything to you ?
no .
can you tell us about the day hope was abducted ?
um ... we were playing hide @-@ and @-@ go @-@ seek
in front of her house .
it &apos;s your turn . don &apos;t peek !
i had just finished counting .
ready or not , here i come !
and i turned around ,
and there he was ...
just standing there smiling at me .
he was holding a jar of butterflies .
he knew that would get my attention .
i &apos;ll be it , ok ? go hide .
and that &apos;s when he asked if he could play .
and i told him he could .
1 ...
2 ...
3 ...
ready or not , here i come .
i &apos;ll never forget that voice .
why didn &apos;t you ever tell anyone ?
because it was my fault .
i &apos;m the one who told him that he could play with us .
i overheard my dad saying
that someone put a butterfly necklace on my bike .
then he asked if i knew who had put it there .
it was my chance to come clean ...
but i just kept my mouth shut .
hey . how you holding up ?
after em , i never thought i &apos;d see another person
i love up there .
baby , you gotta stop blaming yourself .
we &apos;re doing everything we can to find her .
no , we &apos;re not . we &apos;re not doing enough to find her .
if we were doing everything , we would have found her .
i &apos;m not doing everything i can .
every minute that goes by ,
there &apos;s more chance that she &apos;s dead .
ok , garcia , stop it . what ?
stop it . i need you to calm down .
i am doing everything i can
to keep it together and i &apos;m so scared .
ok , you need to listen to me right now .
guys .
we &apos;re ready to deliver the profile .
penelope .
let &apos;s go find her .
ready or not , here i come .
7 years ago we believed our unsub to be
a preferential child molester .
and now we think that his preference evolved
into an erotomanic obsession with hope kingston .
so much so that in her absence ,
his attentions are now focused on her mother .
at the time hope went missing ,
there was another potential victim ,
who was the same age and
had the same physical characteristics as hope ,
and she was even more accessible .
which tells us that hope became his idealized target .
despite the high risk , he abducted monica in public ,
which shows she &apos;s pivotal to his fantasy .
we believe the unsub has monica captive
within a 20 @-@ mile radius of this abduction site .
there &apos;s a strong possibility that until recently
the unsub kept hope alive .
this explains why he didn &apos;t hunt again for all these years .
and that it was hope &apos;s
death that triggered the change in his m.o.
if the same guy has her , how long is she really gonna last ?
i know her .
i know monica . monica is my friend ,
and she is a fighter , and she is not gonna give up ,
so neither should we .
monica ?
don &apos;t go in there !
i didn &apos;t want you to find out like this .
i &apos;m sorry .
i can explain .
no ! don &apos;t touch me .
i loved her , too .
she was my baby ?
the moment i saw her , i knew what a beautiful woman she &apos;d become .
i loved her , monica . i loved her .
no .
no .
no .
you don &apos;t know how i searched .
i was about to give up , and then--and there she was ,
this beautiful cocooned butterfly ready to emerge .
you kept her chained
like an animal .
no , no , no , you don &apos;t understand what happened .
my child .
why did you ...
it wasn &apos;t my fault .
you murdered my baby !
no , hope killed herself !
so the day of the anniversary
would have been when monica was most vulnerable and exposed .
and the unsub knew that and
he came armed with information about hope .
so she lets her guard down , leaves the house ,
and goes to the support group meeting .
where she can share her feelings with people who understand her .
but how did he know after
this particular meeting she &apos;d be emotionally raw ?
well , if he stalked her in the parking lot after the meeting ,
he would have seen the pain written across her face .
what if he knew because he &apos;d heard the story before ?
what if he &apos;s a member of her support group ?
jj , the things we talk about in that group
are beyond personal .
we wouldn &apos;t have asked you to do this
if we didn &apos;t think is was gonna help us find monica .
i know , but to talk about what happens in there ,
it &apos;s a violation of all kinds of--of privacy .
i promise , nothing that doesn &apos;t pertain to this case
will ever leave this room .
who &apos;s sharing ?
monica .
she &apos;s talking about a little girl that looked like hope
that she saw .
ok , now , i want you to look around the room .
is anyone reacting to her ?
no . they &apos;re all just listening to her .
ok , now what happened after monica finished sharing ?
she was trying not to cry and ...
i didn &apos;t know what to say .
did anyone share after her ?
someone started to say something ,
but then i ended the meeting because--
ok , stop right there .
i need to know who spoke .
that &apos;s why we &apos;re all here .
this guy who lost his wife .
he was sitting behind her and he rubbed her shoulder .
he was trying to calm her down .
ok , so let &apos;s move to the end of the night .
what happened after the meeting ?
i followed monica out to the hallway ,
and she said she had to go home .
and then what happened ?
it &apos;s bill .
please let me explain .
no , i don &apos;t want to hear anything .
at night , i could always hear hope walking around up in her room .
and then ...
this one night she was pacing back and forth .
then she stopped . so ...
i came up to check on her ...
but the door was blocked .
and when i tried to open it ...
there was blood everywhere .
no ...
no !
i tried to stop the bleeding ,
but it was too late .
wait a minute .
i &apos;ve heard this .
you spoke in group .
it was ... your wife .
but you were talking about my hope .
i lost her .
you were my only connection to her .
i shed tears for you .
i helped you grieve .
so william rogers joined the support group 2 months ago .
garcia &apos;s still looking for an address .
any priors ?
yeah . an attempted kidnapping of a 14 @-@ year @-@ old .
he lured her to a studio with promises of becoming a model .
when she got there , he made sexual advances . she got away .
you know , rethinking the type of offender he was 7 years ago ,
it &apos;s possible the unsub didn &apos;t sexually assault hope initially
but waited until she was older .
well , that would explain why he held on to her all this time .
in his fantasy , he might envision hope at a more desirable age .
what story did he use to get into the support group ?
well , he told them his pregnant wife committed suicide .
apparently they were trying to conceive for over a year .
hope couldn &apos;t bear the thought
of bringing his child into this world ,
so she took what little control she did have
and ended her life .
and that was never part of his plan .
it turned his world upside down .
he &apos;s not ready to let go of the bond he had with hope .
and now he &apos;s trying to get back what was taken from him .
wouldn &apos;t it just be easier for him to start over again ?
unless monica could give him what he lost .
another hope .
he didn &apos;t take monica to remind him of hope ,
he took her to recreate her .
i want to make peace .
you shared with the group
that you were thinking of having another baby .
what are you--
all those things that you missed out on with hope ,
we &apos;ll get to experience with this new baby
that we &apos;re going to create .
don &apos;t touch me . don &apos;t you touch me !
address , address , address .
this guy like redefined home invasion .
by going to those group meetings ,
it was like he read monica &apos;s diary ,
like she only talked about
her most personal feelings in that group .
the group--the group is definitely gonna have to disband .
focus on finding this address .
i am . i &apos;m focusing and freaking out at the exact same time .
i got it . i got it . he has two addresses .
the first one is on main . it &apos;s listed as a previous ,
but it &apos;s not been updated in the system
and the second one is on brooks .
and i have just sent them to your pdas .
hey , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa . where do you think you &apos;re going ?
i &apos;m going with you .
no , that can &apos;t happen . it could be way too dangerous .
ok . um , either you let me go with you
or you &apos;re going to have to
forcibly remove me from the suv . your choice .
i brought you your favorite tea .
you know , we have to move forward in our lives .
that &apos;s what hope would want .
for both of us .
you think so ?
of course .
monica !
do it ! kill me !
she killed herself so
she wouldn &apos;t have to spend another second with you !
shut up !
you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
you can &apos;t hurt her anymore .
fbi !
they &apos;re in .
officer , we need bolt @-@ cutters .
clear !
clear ! clear !
they cleared the other location .
reid and i are gonna take two officers , check the perimeter ,
see if we can find the point of entry .
you &apos;re with dr . reid , you &apos;re with me .
building rapport could take hours .
i don &apos;t know if monica has that much time .
all right , so we need to treat this like a hostage situation .
i need you to be attentive and compassionate .
just tell him whatever he wants to hear .
ok . i got this . i got this .
hello , this is bill . please leave a message .
bill , it &apos;s penelope from the support group .
bill , i &apos;m not gonna go away .
i need to talk to her . i know monica is in there with you
and i need you to put her on the phone .
monica can &apos;t come to the phone right now .
put her on the phone , bill .
you know i can &apos;t do that .
i think you can , bill .
right now i am the only thing
that is going to help you out of this .
and i want to help you , you need to put her on the phone .
hello ?
monica .
she &apos;s dead .
there you go . she &apos;s fine .
call back .
ok .
penelope , i &apos;m not ...
much of a phone person .
so if you want to continue this conversation in private ...
the door is open .
penelope , don &apos;t !
i &apos;m going in there .
uh--no , no , garcia .
jj , i have to . i have to .
all right . you just stay close .
ok .
jj , we &apos;re in .
all right , go ahead .
bill ?
bill ?
i don &apos;t want to upset you .
bill , you never meant to hurt monica .
just like you never meant to hurt hope .
he murdered my baby .
shut the door !
bill ...
i--i know
the pain you feel . i get you .
i know . i heard you talk about it in group .
why doesn &apos;t monica understand that ?
bill , i just think she needs more time to understand it .
what ?
listen , bill .
i know all you ever wanted
was just somebody to love .
you were trapped inside a cocoon
just waiting for somebody to set you free .
hope made me feel ...
for the first time in my life , i felt love .
she was my baby !
you brought monica here because you &apos;re heartbroken .
and you &apos;re desperate to recreate what you lost with hope .
i lost my child !
bill , you need to tell her .
you can do this , ok ?
you need to let her know why this is all happening .
you need to tell her . you can do this .
say something .
say something !
our baby ...
oh , my god .
oh , my god , my baby .
hope was pregnant .
bill , drop the gun .
do what he says .
drop it--now .
it &apos;s ok , bill .
nice and easy .
now put your hands where i can see them .
slowly step away from monica .
easy ...
monica !
we are each on our own journey .
each of us are on our very own adventure ,
encountering all kinds of challenges ,
and the choices we make on that adventure
will shape us as we go .
those choices will stretch us and test us
and push us to our limit .
and our adventure will make us stronger
than we ever knew we could be .
there &apos;s a quote by my favorite author , joseph campbell ,
and it goes like this :
&quot; find a place inside where there &apos;s joy ,
