today sam riley kicked a soccer ball ...
and it hit another kid so hard his eye popped out .
awesome !
really ? his eye popped out .
never mind .
well , gotta hit the sack . big saturday tomorrow .
that &apos;s right . it &apos;s somebody &apos;s birthday .
not just that . the ipad comes out-
on my actual birthday .
it &apos;s like steve jobs and god got together to say ,
&quot; we love you , phil . &quot;
what is so great about that doohickey anyhow ?
&quot; doohickey , &quot; elly may ?
it &apos;s a movie theater , a library and a music store ...
all rolled into one awesome pad .
a library is a place where people get books .
a movie theater is a place where people go on dates .
i better load the beach chair into the trunk .
i &apos;m gonna need it for the line in the morning .
wait , honey . hang on .
you can &apos;t spend your birthday in line .
well , not the whole day .
i have to be there at 6 : 00 , you &apos;ll forget about it .
then i &apos;m out by 10 : 00 .
why don &apos;t you let me do it ?
claire , you don &apos;t have to do that .
no , i know , but i want to .
and that way on your birthday
you &apos;ll wake up and you &apos;ll have your brand @-@ new toy .
okay .
well , in spite of you calling it a toy ,
this is shaping up to top the best birthday i ever had .
oh , thank god we don &apos;t have to hear that stupid story
about that place ...
it was called the fun zone .
i was 11 .
i hit 10 straight fastballs in the batting cage .
then my best friend jeff sweeney stepped in
and took one in the groin .
i yelled out &quot; ball two ! &quot;
everybody laughed .
that was when i knew i was funny .
good night .
b @-@ e @-@ l @-@ i @-@ e @-@ v @-@ e. believe .
are you sure there &apos;s not an &quot; e @-@ i &quot; in the middle ?
no . it &apos;s &quot; i @-@ e. &quot;
good , papi !
if i can &apos;t fool you , then your teachers can &apos;t fool you either .
i don &apos;t think they &apos;re trying to fool me .
wait until you see what i got phil for his birthday .
i found it on the skymall catalog .
ay . it &apos;s not one of those talking alarm clocks ?
&quot; it &apos;s 6 : 05 . it &apos;s 6 : 25 . wake up . wake up . &quot;
even better . a rosewood chess set .
as matter of fact , before i wrap this thing ,
what say we take it for a spin ?
come on , manny . i &apos;ll teach you .
he knows how to play . his father taught him .
i &apos;m gonna teach him real chess , not the colombian version .
we actually use the pieces to play the game ,
not smuggle stuff out of the country .
i know one colombian piece you won &apos;t be playing with later .
manny , come on . let &apos;s see what you got .
you &apos;ll be surprised .
manny &apos;s an excellent player , but jay is a grumpy loser .
he mopes , he makes the face , he slams the door ,
then he said he didn &apos;t slam the door .
it &apos;s better that he wins .
um , i got this .
everything &apos;s gonna be okay .
it &apos;s okay . it &apos;s okay .
cam !
leave me alone .
there &apos;s a ... there &apos;s a man in lily &apos;s room .
there &apos;s a man in lily &apos;s room !
it &apos;s go time .
oh , thank god .
it &apos;s me , it &apos;s me , it &apos;s me , it &apos;s me .
she &apos;s fine .
we must have just heard a neighbor with the same monitor .
thank god .
boy , if a spider would have broken in here ,
he would have been in trouble .
第一季第十九集
light @-@ up barbecue tongs .
this was the lame gift i got phil .
so , was i bummed to get up at 5 : 00 and wait in line ?
no . no , because i was finally getting my husband
something that he really , really wanted .
i was every bit as excited as he was .
no .
hey , buddy .
i hope you &apos;re not upset about our chess match yesterday .
hey , what do you say we play again ?
i &apos;m good .
that &apos;s the spirit .
downloaded this for you .
it &apos;s kind of a kid &apos;s guide to chess .
no , jay . i &apos;m good .
nah , it &apos;s not all dry like that . they have fun with it .
see , you can color in the little players with your crayons .
now you are making me want to play again .
now we &apos;re lighting a fire . let me toss this out .
if you beat me , if that day should ever come ,
i &apos;ll give you-
i want your watch .
wow , you had that loaded up .
okay . game on .
now , i want you to go first .
now remember , try to open up the middle of the board .
i &apos;d have moved that guy two spaces .
more aggressive .
and you don &apos;t want to bring your queen out that quickly .
see , now you could &apos;ve protected that with that ,
but now you &apos;re vulnerable-
checkmate .
huh ? what ?
how &apos;d you do that ?
you will not believe what &apos;s going on
at jake and debbie &apos;s house .
who ?
the people on the monitor . they must live nearby .
so much drama .
okay , jake told debbie that he had to work late .
so she called his boss
and found out that he didn &apos;t . busted !
so she spent all morning on the phone
crying and crying and crying to her mother ...
and said if jake has to work &quot; late &quot; one more time ,
she &apos;s filing for divorce .
that &apos;s it ? i give you that tasty dish
and all you give me is a &quot; huh &quot; ?
i @-@ i &apos;m s- cam , i froze last night .
i froze .
i thought lily was in danger and i froze .
but not you . no , you sprung right into action .
you even had the cool &quot; it &apos;s go time &quot; line .
that comes to me naturally . i spent a year as a crossing guard .
cam , i mean , what kind of parent am i
if i can &apos;t even protect my own family , you know ?
just once i would love to be the guy with no fear ...

you should get on top of the garage .
alex , stop trying to kill your brother .

alex ? facebook , chat , tweet , buzz , bling ,
i don &apos;t know ! just do what you have to do .
we have got to find one of these ipads . okay ?
luke ? sweetie , that means stay out of everyone &apos;s way
and stop inhaling the balloons .
i &apos;m not inhaling them .
stop lying .
how did she know ?
didn &apos;t your mama teach you never to take a ride from a stranger ?

hello ?
no , that &apos;s fine , i &apos;m just putting the baby down .
okay , that &apos;s jake . he &apos;s the one that &apos;s having an affair .
i know .
yeah , i can do it tomorrow night .
i &apos;ll just give my wife some excuse .
men are pigs .
i don &apos;t really have a choice , do i ?
yeah .
you could not cheat on her ! how about that ?
because it has to be a surprise .
when she hears me speaking italian to her grandmother ,
it &apos;ll be worth all this sneaking around .
lily , i had it backwards . he &apos;s wonderful .
don &apos;t worry . i &apos;ll just tell her i &apos;m working late .
no , jake , don &apos;t do that .
that &apos;s the worst thing you could do .
buonanotte .
oh , no , lily , what are we gonna do ?
we have to fix this .
okay , mitchell , i &apos;m gonna teach you
a couple of basic brazilian jiu @-@ jitsu moves .
now , just attack me .
i &apos;m sorry- what ?
take any deep @-@ seated anger you may have ,
get a running start and come at me .
dad , i don &apos;t have any deep @-@ seated anger .
remember that halloween when
i wouldn &apos;t let you go as olivia newton @-@ john ?
you see what i did ? i used your momentum against you .
i learned this choke from the gracie brothers .
it &apos;s called the lion killer- mata lella .
okay .
now try to get out . try to get out .
see ?
i can &apos;t .
yeah , all right . now-
passing out ...
see , the beauty of this is ,
you don &apos;t have to make the first move .
you know , chances are your opponent &apos;s gonna be overconfident .
he &apos;s gonna think you don &apos;t know anything .
basically , he &apos;s being suckered into thinking-
manny . manny , that little bastard , he hustled me .
oh , crap .
ah , crap . mitchell !
oh , crap . all right . come on . breathe .
attaboy . you all right ? coming around .
why am i on the floor ? - come on , mitchell .
haley , i just struck out again .
please tell me you have some good news .
okay , so the grove just got a new shipment .
i &apos;m texting you the directions now .
oh ! okay , that &apos;s good . that &apos;s good . that &apos;s good .
i &apos;m there . i &apos;m on that .
that kid stole my watch .
huh ?
what ?
he hustled me at chess .
i thought you promised you were gonna let him win .
i did the first time .
wait a minute . you &apos;re in on it too ?
manny , go and get dressed for the party .
do i have time for a steam ?
yeah , but a quick one .
okay .
why tell him to lose to me ?
because you &apos;re like a baby when you don &apos;t win .
with the kicking and the eyebrows ...
and the angry eating of the sunflower seeds .
actually , that &apos;s not true .
i don &apos;t mind losing to a chess genius , which manny obviously is .
chess genius ? he &apos;s not even as good as i am .
you &apos;re not that good in chess .
i beat you on our honeymoon .
or did i let you win ?
you didn &apos;t let me win .
why would i sacrifice my queen for your pawn , jay ?
stop saying that .
luke , honey , hi . what &apos;s going on ?
they guy came with dad &apos;s cake ,
but just so you know , it &apos;s missing a piece .
luke , did you take a bite out of your father &apos;s cake ?
no .
stop lying , luke .
i &apos;m not lying .
by the way , i used your credit card to pay him .
is that all right ?
oh , no , that &apos;s fine .
whatever . that &apos;s why i left the wallet there .
oh , my god .
oh , my god !
i left the wallet there ! i left the wa-
your poor father .
all this running around ,
and he &apos;s gonna think nobody cares about him on his birthday .
more cake ?
why not , little phil ?
i got no place else to go .
sir ! sir ! sir , hi . excuse me .
um , yes . i know this is highly unusual ,
but i need your help to save a marriage .
there is a couple in this neighborhood ...
that is about to get a divorce for a simple misunderstanding .
their name is jake and debbie .
and i know you &apos;ve taken an oath ...
to not tell people where other people live ,
and i respect that ,
but maybe we could work out some sort of
super secretive spy signal ,
where if you scratch your left ear ,
you know , maybe they live on the left ,
and if you scratch your right ear , they live on-
they live right here .
this conversation never happened .
sorry .
oh , thank god !
oh , thank you . thank you .
dad just put me to sleep .
the hunting story .
hmm . no .
oh , my gosh , no . you can &apos;t cut the line . sorry .
i was here .
uh @-@ uh .
i @-@ i &apos;ve been here for an hour and a half
and you haven &apos;t been , so you cut the line .
whatever .
whoa . excuse me , sir .
i don &apos;t think you understand .
you &apos;re not getting in front of us .
calm down , gingerbread .
are you gonna move or not ?
no .
oh , no .
then you leave me no choice .
oh , my god .
go to sleep .
go to sleep . go to sleep .
no .
mitchell , what are you doing ? get off of him .
shut up .
he &apos;s about to go to sleep .
no , i &apos;m not .
okay , folks . break this up . you three- out of line .
oh , no . i &apos;m sorry , sir . i didn &apos;t have anything to do with this .
i &apos;m just waiting in line to get an ipad .
i don &apos;t even know this guy .
oh , my god . i need your credit card .
he &apos;s the problem .
shut up ! you &apos;re supposed to be asleep .
it &apos;s okay . i have it .
get off !
i &apos;ve got it .
what ?
i &apos;ve got your card . i &apos;m good . no , i &apos;m good .
i &apos;m good . i &apos;m here . i &apos;m here !
i &apos;ve gotta get my husband an ipad !
key to a good birthday ? low expectations .
thought i was getting an ipad . i was wrong about that .
thought i was getting a surprise party at the batting cages .
sorry , big phil .
guess when it comes right down to it ,
we &apos;re all just jeff sweeney taking a fastball to the plums .
hey , um , dad , your cake fell off the counter ,
but uncle cam &apos;s trying to fix it .
he won &apos;t .
and the pizzas never showed up .
and they won &apos;t !
hey , balloons .
fine . i guess we &apos;ll never know .
or we can find out right now .
yeah , manny , give me the chess set .
oh , it &apos;s a chess set .
yeah . you &apos;ll get it later .
we got something to settle now .
go in there .

no .
oh , cam , cam , you &apos;ll never believe what happened .
happy birthday , phil !

you &apos;ll never believe what happened .
i got in trouble for fighting .
and we saved a marriage .
well , this is the best day ever .
it really is .
ain &apos;t it though ?
look at this , papi , huh ?
easy .
you can &apos;t sing &quot; we are the champions ... &quot;
without your queen .
damn it ! listen , i lose and i burn this house down !
ah , but look at this ...
honey , honey .
what are we doing ? this is ridiculous .
one of us is gonna win the game ,
the other &apos;s gonna feel lousy , and we both lose .
yeah , just leave my birthday present on the floor .
that &apos;s my girl . she had me .
there was no way i could win . i knew it .
i &apos;m just glad she didn &apos;t know it yet .
two moves , and then-
i &apos;m a very good chess player .
but i &apos;m a better wife .
hey , did you get it ?
no .
how &apos;s your dad ?
acting weird ... er .
hey , wife .

just heading out to the yard to get a shovel for my cake .
mom .
luke , what do you want ?
i went on dad &apos;s computer ,
contacted some of his geek friends ,
told them that he was dying
and his last wish was an ipad .
luke , what have i told you about-
