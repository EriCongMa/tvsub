hey , hey , hey , hey . there you are .
how are you settling in ?
oh , you know . like riding a bike .
you know , i &apos;ve been meaning to ask ,
um , i &apos;ve got an opening in my poker group next week .
why don &apos;t you join us .
oh , my dance card &apos;s kind of full these days , rossi ,
you know , getting ready for a baby .
well , that &apos;s all the more reason to play ,
you know , jump @-@ start the kid &apos;s college fund with a little money .
ok .
ok , i &apos;ll see what i can do .
i left a file in the conference room .
i was just in there . i didn &apos;t see any files .
you sure about that ?
positive . no files .
i--i would have noticed .
all right , your eyes are starting to do
that little thing that they do .
let &apos;s have it .
have what ?
it &apos;s not my birthday .
and i said to you , please , no welcome back party .
all right , look , i &apos;m not saying ,
but i was supposed to distract you ,
so do me a favor and act surprised
when you go in there , all right ?
all right , i got you covered .
and let &apos;s just keep it an extra 30 seconds , just to be sure .
no problem .
so my eyes do this thing , huh ?
little bit .
i better work on that before poker night .
surprise ! surprise !
welcome back !
whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , no , you didn &apos;t .
not my idea , babe . i was outnumbered .
how long has this been in the works ?
oh , two weeks . you didn &apos;t suspect ?
i , uh , had no idea .
that &apos;s good . a certain amount of cluelessness
is nice in a husband .
ok , hush up .
amen to that . a woman is entitled to her secrets ,
especially from a profiler .
well , this profiler may not be changing any diapers ,
but i will tear up some diaper cake .
oh , you look like a diaper changer to me .
yes , you will be changing some diapers .
ladies , i was joking , i was joking .
look , baby , i was joking . it was a joke .
yeah , we &apos;re on the way .
i &apos;ll activate the child abduction rapid deployment team from here .
yeah , thanks . come in .
hey , i have been sent to commandeer you .
sir , party &apos;s in high gear .
there &apos;s been a double homicide and a child abduction in wichita .
uh , i &apos;ll go let the others know .
jj .
give them 10 minutes .
there &apos;s time while the plane &apos;s being readied .
&quot; parents are the bones on which children sharpen their teeth . &quot;
peter ustinov .
thank you .
ronnie brewer is still missing .
both parents &apos; eyes were filled with sand and glued shut .
mr. sandman , bring me a nightmare .
this is a well organized unsub .
he managed to kill both parents ,
perform a complicated ritual ,
and successfully abduct the boy .
jj &apos;s right . it &apos;s a lot of moving parts
for one person to orchestrate .
could we be looking at a team ?
this is reminiscent of the killing
of the clutter family in 1959 , also in kansas .
that crime was perpetrated by two ex @-@ cons working together .
the &quot; in cold blood &quot; murders .
but that was a robbery gone bad .
it doesn &apos;t seem to be the case here .
well , assuming ronnie brewer was the ultimate target ,
why risk entering the home at all ?
i mean , wouldn &apos;t it be simpler just to grab the kid
on the way to school ?
well , the abduction of the child
from a place of presumed safety
must be an essential part of his ritual .
who knows ? maybe the killer
had a score to settle with mom and dad , too .
the sealing of the eyes could indicate remorse .
he didn &apos;t want them to see what he was doing to their kid .
then why not just kill them immediately ?
i mean , he must have a reason
for rendering the parents functionally blind first .
you know , the sand in the eyes
could be a purely symbolic gesture .
the sandman was a mythical character
who would sprinkle magic dust
in the eyes of children while they slept .
yeah , but i thought he was a benevolent figure ,
a bringer of good dreams .
not always . in one version of the myth ,
he would actually pop the eyeballs out of kids
to use as food for his own offspring .
geeze . i stand corrected .
all right , when we land ,
dave , you and jj go to the crime scene .
reid and lewis to the m.e. ,
and morgan and i will get set up at the precinct .
an amber alert has been issued
and police checkpoints have been established
here , here , and here .
i understand a witness saw a vehicle
leaving the area about the time of the murders ?
that &apos;s right . a farmhand employed by mr. brewer .
he reported seeing a white male in a gray sedan speeding away .
did he get the make or model ?
no . the car was out on the main road ,
not the driveway , so the worker didn &apos;t think
much of it until he discovered the bodies .
about what time was that ?
shortly before dawn .
well , this is a small agricultural community .
if the killer stalked the brewer family beforehand ,
someone may have noticed .
or he could be a seasonal worker
with no local connections .
which would be our worst @-@ case scenario ,
someone who came from nowhere
and is now headed back to nowhere .
no tread marks anywhere ,
the unsub probably parked his car
along the main road and walked in ,
does the family have dogs ?
no . no security system either .
well , there &apos;s nothing around back .
the garage and storage were unlocked .
and i bet the brewers probably never locked their front door .
you know , that &apos;s not so unusual .
i grew up in a place like this
and that &apos;s just how it was .
people trusted one another .
trust is a good thing .
so are deadbolts and a rottweiler .
hopefully some of this blood &apos;s the unsub &apos;s
and we can pull dna .
lyla brewer &apos;s body was found in the hallway .
her husband never made it out of bed .
he must have been killed first .
well , it makes sense .
eliminate the primary threat
before moving on to mother and child .
mrs. brewer spent some time stumbling around out here .
and in the child &apos;s bedroom
and in the bathroom and in the study .
she covered a lot of ground before dying .
there are , uh , fresh scratches on the floor here .
too heavy for her to have moved .
what if the unsub did it to block the top of the stairs ?
seal off the child &apos;s escape , maybe ?
or prevent a blinded mrs. brewer from taking a fall ?
strange that he &apos;d be concerned for her safety
right before crushing her skull .
i don &apos;t get it . if the goal was the child
and jim brewer &apos;s attack was quick and lethal ,
why did the unsub let lyla stumble around for so long
before finally killing her ?
good to see you again , dr. reid .
nice to see you .
again ?
yeah . we had a case here 4 years ago .
the tornado guy . that was one for the books .
so do we have a c.o.d. on the victims ?
mr. brewer &apos;s was massive blood loss
from a severed trachea ,
most likely a thin @-@ bladed serrated knife .
and mrs. brewer ?
her skull was fractured .
some type of blunt @-@ force trauma .
it &apos;s highly unusual for a killer to use
different weapons on different victims .
speaking of unusual , take a look .
corneal tissue samples from the eyes of each victim .
mr. brewer &apos;s on the left and mrs. brewer &apos;s on the right .
mrs. brewer &apos;s has many more macrophages .
that &apos;s right . it &apos;s a natural
immunological response to a foreign substance .
huh . the white blood cells in mr. brewer &apos;s sample
are completely normal .
plain english--his eyes didn &apos;t react to the glue .
plainer english-- he was already dead when it happened .
garcia &apos;s not coming up with much .
the brewer family was well @-@ liked .
no known enemies .
what about registered sex offenders in the area ?
there &apos;s over a thousand in wichita alone .
garcia &apos;s checking them out .
agent hotchner .
the body of a young boy was just found .
where ?
prairie creek road , a few miles from the crime scene .
the description matches ronnie brewer .
the child &apos;s body has not yet been identified ,
but there is growing fear that it could be ronnie brewer ,
the boy missing from the attack here in wichita last night .
stay tuned--
hey , hotch , we &apos;re done here .
it &apos;s definitely ronnie .
i recognize him from the family photos .
body temperature and state of rigor
indicates that he &apos;s been dead 7 to 8 hours .
so he must have been killed immediately after the abduction .
it doesn &apos;t make sense . all the effort put into taking him .
well , maybe the compulsion is about the pursuit of the child
rather than the child itself .
well , if that &apos;s the case , he &apos;s gonna try again soon ,
with someone else .
josie !
time to come in .
i &apos;m texting with gaby . in a minute .
that &apos;s what you said 20 minutes ago .
i want your homework done before dinner .
unfortunately , all of the blood at the brewer crime scene
was either from lyla or jim brewer . nothing from the unsub .
i just talked to the m.e. ronnie brewer died from asphyxiation
but had not been sexually assaulted .
unless strangling the boy was the sexual release .
or it could have been the unsub &apos;s first abduction
and he panicked ,
disposed of the child immediately once he had him .
the m.e. also said that the type of glue in the brewers &apos; eyes
is frequently used for surgical closures ,
so the drying process on the skin in well documented .
apparently it had been applied at 5 : 15 a.m.
well , the farm hand said they saw that gray sedan
flee the scene at 6 : 20 , so if that was our unsub ,
what was he doing in the house for that hour ?
all josie ever does is stare at that phone .
it &apos;s not normal .
she &apos;s 13 . it &apos;s normal .
girls her age should be out doing things .
what &apos;s so funny ?
picturing you a hundred years ago .
&quot; motor cars aren &apos;t normal .
what the hell &apos;s wrong with the horse and buggy ? &quot;
good night .
good night .
the glue our unsub used is sold practically everywhere ,
so we can &apos;t isolate point of purchase .
a mineral analysis from the sand , however ,
indicates that it came from the seneca river in upstate new york .
you ok ?
yeah .
morgan , we &apos;re gonna find the people who tried to kill you .
he was in his pajamas .
ronnie brewer .
out there by the side of the road ,
he was still in his pajamas .
i &apos;m sorry , kid , i , uh ,
i don &apos;t know , man .
6 months on the sidelines .
i guess i still have a few blisters
where i used to have calluses .
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s what this is .
oh , no ?
then what is it ?
you &apos;re about to be a dad . you know ?
you have to expect the world to start to feel different .
it just feels so hard .
not as in difficult .
literally hard .
like asphalt is hard .
like pavement .
and children are soft .
yeah .
defenseless .
that &apos;s why every day
we try to make this world a little safer .
if there &apos;s one thing i &apos;m sure of ,
is that you and savannah are going to be great parents .
charge by the hour , doc ?
josie ? !
josie !
aah ! no ...
oh , my god .
eleven .
so what do we know ?
our father &apos;s dead , daughter &apos;s missing ,
but we may have caught a break here . the mother survived .
do you know if she &apos;s able to talk ?
no , she just went into surgery .
jj &apos;s at the hospital with her .
but it &apos;s definitely our guy .
glue and sand in both parents &apos; eyes
and the father &apos;s throat was slit .
i saw an alarm panel by the front door .
it wasn &apos;t activated , but it did keep the computerized log
of all home activity .
shows the back door was opened and closed at 3 : 35 a.m.
and then again at 4 : 47 a.m.
an hour , just like the other attack ,
but this time he left a witness .
well , he may have gotten sloppy
and assumed she was dead .
i mean , she was found unconscious in a pool of blood .
family have any other children ?
just josie , the missing daughter .
‭ - how old is she ?
13 .
preferential sex offenders
usually cross age and gender lines
only when their preference isn &apos;t available .
and ronnie brewer wasn &apos;t sexually assaulted ,
so we may not be dealing with a pedophile .
no , i don &apos;t think we are . this is something else entirely .
we &apos;re looking for a family annihilator .
we believe he &apos;s a white male in his early to mid @-@ 30s .
he is intelligent ,
well organized , and meticulous .
family annihilators are often quick and ruthless ,
but this unsub prolongs the suffering of his victims .
he appears to kill in stages .
first the father , then the mother ,
and finally the child .
the mother seems to be the primary target of the unsub &apos;s rage .
she is forced to endure a sense of helplessness
for upwards of an hour while her child is in danger .
so we &apos;re dealing with a sadist ?
yes , but not sadism as we typically think of it .
despite the savagery of the attacks ,
the killer does not derive gratification from inflicting pain .
it &apos;s from observing the panic in his victims .
the sadism is psychological .
something may have happened in the unsub &apos;s childhood
where he felt unprotected .
perhaps his own mother turned a blind eye
to a real or perceived danger .
and this could explain the ritual
of placing sand and glue in the parents &apos; eyes ,
symbolically blinding them as punishment .
ellie zumwalt survived her injuries ,
and this may discourage this unsub
and make him more cautious .
or have the opposite effect .
it could infuriate him and spur him to attack again soon ,
with increased violence .
residents in remote or rural areas
and families with an only child
should exercise extreme caution in the coming days .
thank you .
still no sign of josie zumwalt .
and we scoured every inch of road in a 10 @-@ mile radius .
well , either she &apos;s still alive or the unsub
did a much better job of body concealment this time .
if he did kill her ,
why deviate from his previous disposal method ?
my gut says he &apos;s still holding her .
but why her and not the brewer boy ?
i &apos;m not sure . but things didn &apos;t go as planned
in the second attack . ellie zumwalt survived .
ok . maybe it &apos;s like we profiled--
he has to kill sequentially ,
in the order of the brewer family murders .
so , until the mother dies , he can &apos;t kill the child .
i &apos;ll have the hospital beef up security .
yeah .
guys . take a look at this .
look at the mantel .
the hourglass .
yeah , it isn &apos;t in the christmas photo
which was only taken a couple months earlier .
could be a recent purchase
or they might have moved it there
from some other place in the house .
except we know the unsub
spends an hour at each crime scene .
what if he brought it with him as a kind of timer ?
ok . i &apos;ll have sgt. whitfield search the zumwalt house
for a similar hourglass .
it &apos;s hotch .
ellie zumwalt is out of surgery and awake .
thank you .
we appreciate you talking to us , mrs. zumwalt .
we know this is a difficult time .
my husband is dead , isn &apos;t he ?
yes , he is .
we &apos;re very sorry .
what about josie ?
is my daughter all right ?
we &apos;re hopeful .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s important that you tell us
everything you can about what happened .
i was asleep ,
and then there was a scream .
it was josie .
i woke up , but my eyes wouldn &apos;t open .
josie kept screaming .
and every time i went to where i thought she was ,
the scream came from somewhere else .
we realize you couldn &apos;t see well ,
but could you make out any features about this man ?
no .
he--he wore something on his face .
they were like , um ,
i don &apos;t know , glasses .
like eyeglasses ?
no , no . bigger than that .
more like , um , like goggles .
that &apos;s all i could make out .
did he speak ?
only at the end .
eleven .
that &apos;s all he said .
&quot; eleven . &quot;
ms. zumwalt ,
do your or anybody in the family own an hourglass ?
police found this in your living room .
i &apos;ve never seen that before in my life .
what you got , baby girl ?
what i &apos;ve got is fail , fail , and more fail .
remember thomas alva edison , penelope .
&quot; i have not failed .
i &apos;ve just found 10,000 ways that won &apos;t work . &quot;
ok , let me rephrase what i just said .
i &apos;m currently waist @-@ deep in what is not working .
despite the distinctive craftsmanship ,
i cannot figure out who made these hourglasses ,
and i haven &apos;t been able to find a single person
who recently relocated from upstate new york to wichita .
something must connect our unsub
to the seneca river .
all the sand in the world right here
and this guy brings dirt from 1,500 miles away .
garcia , you confirmed that the hourglasses were handcrafted ?
oh , for sure . we &apos;re talking topnotch museum quality ,
but not by any artisan known
in the high @-@ end glass @-@ blowing community ,
and yes , there is such a thing
as the high @-@ end glass @-@ blowing community .
all right , look for boys ages 8 to 12
who were sexually victimized and / or abducted
in upstate new york in the mid @-@ 1990s , all right ?
ok . hit you back if and when .
they &apos;re analyzing the sand from both hourglasses now
to see if it matches what was put in the victims &apos; eyes .
so far no prints or dna .
the unsub &apos;s careful .
and precise . i calculated
the width of hourglass necks
with the average grain of sand
having a .2 @-@ millimeter diameter
and a volume of .0042 cubic millimeters .
given the weight of the sand ,
that &apos;s a gravity flow duration of 3,600 seconds .
you know , obviously give or take a few .
skill level off the charts ,
yet his work is unknown .
not for sale , not even for display .
this guy operates in a vacuum .
which speaks to the intensely private nature of his obsession .
mineral analysis just came in on the hourglass sand .
also from upstate new york ?
no , it &apos;s local .
most likely from the platte river .
what &apos;s the matter , sergeant ?
it &apos;s what they found mixed in with the sand .
human bone and tooth enamel .
please , don &apos;t hurt me . please .
hello .
hi there .
uh , i was trying to call hotch ,
but it kept going to voicemail .
he &apos;s still at the hospital with jj . what &apos;s going on ?
ok , i did what man chocolate asked .
i got this list .
there are certain things that should never exist ,
and one of those is this depressingly long list .
does anything specific jump out at you ?
aside from the horribleness of it all , no .
you know , send me all the police , hospital ,
and child services transcripts associated with the cases .
everything on all of them ?
yeah , i &apos;ll print out hard copies here .
ok . you &apos;re gonna need a forklift ,
and i hope you &apos;re using recyclable paper , but ...
on its way .
all right . thank you so much , garcia .
why are you doing this ?
i never did anything to you .
i don &apos;t understand .
no , no , no . please ! please , i &apos;ll be quiet .
i don &apos;t want to go in there !
i promise i &apos;ll be quiet .
no , don &apos;t !
no , don &apos;t !
please , i &apos;ll be quiet . please !
i want to go home ! please !
i wonder what the unsub meant by &quot; eleven . &quot;
we know he measures the time spent in each house .
it could be some sort of countdown .
what are you thinking , aaron ?
the hospital report on ellie zumwalt .
her injuries were minor .
it was the gradual loss of blood
that caused her to lose consciousness .
well , the unsub must have thought
she bled out and left her for dead .
that was his big mistake .
i don &apos;t think there was a mistake .
what do you mean ?
what if ellie zumwalt was never meant to die ,
that the mistake that the unsub made
was actually at the first crime scene ?
the brewer murders ? the guy &apos;s a family annihilator .
he killed them all . to me that sounds like mission accomplished .
we didn &apos;t understand why he used two different murder weapons
on jim and lyla brewer .
that &apos;s because there never was a second weapon .
i &apos;m still not following .
dave , you said that a large piece of furniture
was moved to block the top of the stairs at the brewer house .
that &apos;s right . jj and i assumed
it was to prevent her from escaping .
i don &apos;t think so . it wasn &apos;t to set her up for the kill .
it was to keep her from falling down the stairs and killing herself .
so her skull fracture was what , an accident ?
the victim was blinded , hardwood floors slippery with blood .
she could have fallen and hit her head on a blunt object .
that means the unsub &apos;s plan all along
was for both mothers to survive .
exactly .
but why ?
that &apos;s what we need to figure out .
josie &apos;s fate depends on it .
found someone .
who ?
patrick sorenson of oswego , new york .
he was on garcia &apos;s list of potential victims .
abducted by a pedophile in 1993 when he was 9,
raised by a single mother with substance abuse problems .
a mother who was literally
asleep at the wheel when the boy was taken .
she was passed out drunk in her car parked behind their house .
the boy said he screamed for help ,
but the mom never came .
well , that explains the ritual of blaming the surrogate mother
while she sleeps .
and it gets worse . listen to this .
while patrick was recovering in the hospital ,
the mother left a good @-@ bye note on the kitchen table
and was never heard from again .
she abandoned him . the guilt must have been too much .
any idea of the whereabouts of patrick or the mother ?
the mom never surfaced . patrick went into the foster care system
and moved back to oswego ,
where he lived quietly up until 6 weeks ago ,
when he vanished without a trace .
garcia can &apos;t even find a picture of him as an adult , but ...
read that part right there .
it says here patrick told authorities
he got through the assault by focusing on sand .
his attacker made him stare at an hourglass
while the abuse went on .
he was told that if he didn &apos;t cry
until all the sand emptied out , he wouldn &apos;t be killed .
so the trauma of the assault
was fused with the image of an hourglass .
and launched an obsession with time ,
so much so that he went on to build devices
that measure it with extraordinary mathematical precision .
and the police report says
he was abducted on a thursday night at 10 : 00
and was found released in a park the next morning at 9 : 00 .
11 hours later .
that &apos;s what he meant with ellie zumwalt .
he was telling her the amount of time
that he himself had been held in captivity .
and that may be josie zumwalt &apos;s timeline .
so the clock is on ellie , not josie .
she &apos;s got 11 hours to
give this unsub what he didn &apos;t get from his own mother .
josie was taken at 4 : 30 this morning ,
which means we have until 3 : 30 this afternoon .
jj , are you still at the hospital ?
good . here &apos;s what i need you to do .
an apology ?
we can do it from here .
this room , one cameraman , no reporters .
i don &apos;t understand .
the man who took your daughter
left you alive intentionally .
but ... but why ?
because he needs to hear you express
how sorry you are for what happened .
but it wasn &apos;t my fault .
josie knows that i didn &apos;t--
i know . you &apos;re not apologizing to josie .
in fact , don &apos;t ever mention her name .
just refer to her as your child .
don &apos;t even say daughter .
you &apos;re really talking to the man who took her .
well , how do we know he &apos;ll be watching ?
my team &apos;s coordinating with local media to get the word out .
he &apos;ll be watching .
and if i do this , then he &apos;ll let josie go ?
there &apos;s a chance ,
yes .
word just in from a local hospital
that ellie zumwalt , recovering from injuries
suffered in the latest attack on local families ,
is going to speak to the public within an hour .
we don &apos;t know what this unexpected statement will be ,
but concern is rising for the hours passed
with no word on her abducted daughter .
come on , penelope , think .
patrick sorenson didn &apos;t just vanish into thin air .
there &apos;s gotta be some way that he ...
oh , yes , there might be
some thomas alva edison in me yet .
what do you got , garcia ?
what i have got is betty cordray of wichita , kansas ,
which i know makes no sense ,
but actually , betty cordray is not betty cordray ,
she &apos;s betty sorenson of long @-@ lost fame .
the mother who abandoned patrick .
none other .
is she still in the area ?
no . she died 6 weeks ago of kidney failure ,
and then when the paperwork started ,
you know , the paperwork that happens when you die ,
her real identity was revealed
and patrick was called as her next of kin .
that must have been the trigger .
that &apos;s when he dropped off the map in new york .
yeah , and if he was holding out hope for answers
from that mother one day ,
that hope was suddenly gone .
garcia , did betty sorenson own any property in the wichita area ?
nope , she lived in a studio apartment .
then after she died , was she buried or cremated ?
uh ... neither .
she was held in the morgue ,
patrick was called to identify her body ,
but he never showed up . i guess she &apos;s still there ?
all right , i &apos;ll check it out .
we &apos;re recording .
this is a message for my child .
if you can hear me , sweetheart ,
please listen carefully .
there &apos;s something i need to tell you .
i &apos;ve been a bad mother ,
and i did a terrible thing to let this happen to you .
it &apos;s all my fault .
you deserve better than this .
you deserve so much more .
even though i know you &apos;re brave ...
and you &apos;re not crying ,
you need to know i cried for you .
you &apos;re so much stronger than i am .
stronger than i am .
honey , if you come home safely now , i promise
i will love you and hold you
and never let any more harm come to you .
if you can hear me now ,
please call as soon as you can .
you know how to reach me .
i promise i will explain to you once and for all
why i did what i did .
ok , it &apos;s over . you did great .
you did great .
we &apos;ll keep bodies on ice for as long as 3 or 4 months .
if nobody claims them by then ,
they get buried on the city &apos;s dime .
and mrs. sorenson &apos;s son never showed up ?
no , ma &apos;am . we tried to track him down , but ...
this is it . pretty sad .
you live your life
and you end up like unclaimed baggage .
hotch , we solved the mystery
of the bone fragments in the hourglass .
patrick was going to have that reunion with his mother ,
one way or another .
patrick sorenson has to be holed up nearby , but where ?
someplace secluded , that &apos;s for sure .
hauling a corpse through the front door
would tend to perk up the neighbors .
well , if there was an 11 @-@ hour clock on josie zumwalt ,
the bell just rang .
don &apos;t hurt me . please .
please .
call her .
