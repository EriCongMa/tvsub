Fire at one, this is Castle requesting an update.
One. Commander McGarrett has the prisoner secure. Over.
You know what's funny.
You don't look Hawaiian.
You're gonna tell us everything.
But you were born there, weren't you?
Every terrorist cell you and Victor helped arm,
every supplier you've worked with,
all your trafficking associates,
everyone you've ever sold weapons to.
Chasing my brother and I around the world for five years,
like a little doggy looking for a bone.
You don't think we'd do our homework on you?
You should get that.
You don't speak to your father nearly enough.
Dad.
Hey, Champ.
You all right?
Who are these people, Steve?
Now I know where you get it from.
You've got a tough old man here.
Steve, we both have something to lose here.
So listen to me very carefully.
I'm offering you a trade.
Send Honolulu P.D.
Your father for my brother.
All things considered,
I'd say it's more than generous, wouldn't you?
You're smart enough to know that's never gonna happen.
I appreciate the compliment.
Are you smart enough?
Come on, Victor. You know how this works.
We don't negotiate with terrorists.
Make an exception.
Ghost to One. I triangulated their cell signal.
The convoy's ten miles west of your position.
I'm not gonna negotiate like this.
Oh, are we negotiating now?
You kill him, you get nothing.
Give me the phone.
Please.
I can get him to help you.
He'll listen to me. He's my son.
Listen to me, Champ.
Dad, I'm gonna get you out of there, all right?
Don't you worry about it.
I'm sorry that I lied to you.
What? Lied to me about what, Dad?
What are you talking about?
I love you, son.
I didn't say it enough.
Whatever these people want, Steve,
don't give it to them.
Don't you give it to them!
Dad? Dad?!
No more games!
I'm taking my brother now!
I swear to God, I will hunt you down and I will kill you.
Hey. Boom.
This is Transport. We're under attack.
Taking rocket and small arms fire...
Everybody, move it! Move!
Sarge! Sir!
Come on!
Come on! Let's go!
Get down!
Man down! Man down! Watch your cover! Move!
Quick! Quick! Quick! Quick! Watch it.
Men, move out!
Come here.
Come on. Come on.
Come here.
No! No! No! Get down!
No! No! Don't do it!
Put it down!
Come on, Anton.
Come on.
Come on, Anton.
No! No! No!
What happened?
Victor...
Listen.
Put Anton on the phone.
My brother's dead,
isn't he?
Victor, listen.
Isn't he?!
Then so is your father.
No!
Honolulu approach. Reach 717.
Level at 3,000.
717, turn left
zero-one-zero, maintain 3,000
until established on approach.
How long since you've been home?
It's been a while.
Sir, I've got a call coming in for you
from the Governor of Hawaii.
Commander?
Governor.
Thanks for agreeing to see me.
I am so sorry about your loss.
Is this about the investigation?
Yes. We have alerts across all the islands.
You won't find Victor Hesse
with roadblocks and search warrants.
He's gone underground until he can find
a safe way to leave the island.
Now why am I here?
I'd like to help you get what you came back here for.
Let's walk.
Your father's death was a wake-up call
to me and every law enforcement agency in Hawaii,
which is why I'm putting together a task force,
and I want you to run it.
You don't even know me.
I know your resume.
Annapolis.
Five years, Naval Intelligence.
Six with the SEALS.
Your superiors say that you are the best
that they have ever seen.
Let me stop you right there.
I've been tracking Victor Hesse for five years.
If he was bold enough to surface,
I promise you he already has an exit strategy planned,
and he knows I know it, which means,
I can barely afford the hour it's gonna take to bury my father,
let alone stand here talking to you.
Excuse me.
I can help you find this son of a bitch,
Wth full immunity and means.
Your task force will have full blanket authority
to go after guys like Hesse
and get them the hell off my island.
Your rules, my backing, no red tape.
And I promise you, Commander,
what you see with me is what you get.
Here's what I see.
An election year coming up,
and a politician who needs the PR,
who's willing to do whatever it takes--
including bringing me down here to Pearl Harbor,
where my grandfather was killed,
so I might feel some kind of obligation
to fulfill my family destiny.
Is that about right, Governor?
None of those things make me feel less responsible.
I knew your father, Commander.
This is personal for me, too.
Pass.
All right.
Here's my private number.
Please think it over.
Thanks.
She's a smart lady, that one.
Steve McGarrett, right?
I know you.
You'd better. Chin Ho Kelly.
Oh. Chin Ho Kelly.
Kahuku High School.
You were a great quarterback.
Oh, that's very kind of you to say,
considering you were the one that broke all my records.
Oh, that was a long time ago.
I heard you became a cop.
I worked with your father in the Seventh.
He taught me everything I know about wearing a badge.
Looks like you moved on to greener pasture.
Well, let's just say, the Honolulu PD and I had a disagreement
over my job description.
But your father understood.
He was very good to me after I was let go.
He stayed my friend, and I know that cost him something.
I only wish there was some way I could pay him back.
But now that you're here, maybe you can do something.
What do you mean?
I hear, the chief of police put a haole
on your father's murder investigation.
Word is, he's fresh meat from the mainland,
which means he has no clue how this island works.
No, it's perfect.
But I've been on hold so long, I forgot who I was talking to.
I need a warrant write-up for a surveillance wire
on a suspect in connection to the John McGarrett murder.
Suspects name is Doran. Fred Doran.
D-o-r-a-n.
Yeah, that's terrific. Thank you.
Hi, Daddy.
Thank you. It was a good hug.
Who, uh... Who's that?
Mr. Hoppy. Stan bought him for me
for the animal show-and-tell.
Oh, good old Step Stan.
He's very cute.
Not as cute as you, though.
We'd better go.
We don't want Mr. Hoppy
to be late for his first day of school, do we?
No.
That's right. All right.
Where are you going? You driving?
Hmm. Come on, let's go this way.
You want to drive?
You can't drive. You're too little.
Let's go. You're making me dizzy. Come on.
Hey, look at... What's that?
Okay. What are you doing? What are you looking at over there?
Let's go. We got to go.
We're gonna be late for school.
I love you, son.
Listen to me, Champ...
I can't continue this investigation
into the police department from the inside.
I don't trust the people I work with.
So I'm gonna have to do this on my own.
It's all about the key.
I just don't know what it's for.
I have only been able to find two source...
You! Hands up! Don't move!
Who are you?
Who are you?
I am Detective Danny Williams...
Lieutenant Commander Steve McGarrett!
This is my father's house.
Put your weapon down right now.
Show me your I.D.!
You show me your I.D.! Right now!
I'm not putting my gun down.
Neither am I.
Use your free hand, take out your I.D.
Please, after you.
At the same time?
At the same time?
Yeah, at the same time.
What, like, on the count of three?
Sure. Okay, three's good.
One...
Two...
Three.
Listen, uh,
I'm really sorry about your father,
but you can't be here right now.
This is an active crime scene.
Doesn't seem that active.
I can't share any information with you.
Hesse wasn't here alone when my father was murdered.
Someone was sitting at the desk in the study.
There was a space clear for a 13-inch laptop
and my father hated computers.
I'm gonna ask you again. You got to leave.
You got it.
And you can leave the box. That is evidence.
You know that.
I came with this.
No, you didn't come with it.
I see the dust void it left
right here on the counter. What's in the box?
How long you been with the Honolulu PD?
None of your business. What are you, Barbara Walters?
No, it is my business if you're investigating my father's death.
I am, and I'd like to get back to that, so the sooner you leave,
the sooner I can.
Anything you say.
Leave the box or get arrested,
all right?
You gonna call for backup?
An ambulance.
Thank you.
Don't thank me yet.
What are you doing?
Uh, yeah, Governor Jameson, please?
Tell her it's Steve McGarrett.
Oh, please.
Commander, Governor Jameson here.
What can I do for you?
Governor, I'll take the job.
Well, let's just say I found something
that changed my mind.
No, no, no, immediately.
I'll transfer to the reserves,
and I'll run your task force.
Wha... What, right now?
Okay.
I, Steven J. McGarrett,
Do solemnly declare upon my honor and conscience
That I will act at all times
to the best of my ability and knowledge
in a manner befitting an officer of the law."
Thank you, Governor.
Now it's my crime scene.
I swung by your precinct, spoke to your Captain.
He said you requested a wire
be put on someone named Fred Doran.
Tell me about it.
Come in.
This your kid?
Yeah, that's stunning detective work.
You don't actually let her... stay here with you, do you?
What are you, uh, Nanny 911?
So, what do you know about this guy... Doran?
Oh, but surely, you don't need my help, right?
Enlighten me.
He's a suspected arms dealer.
Two years Maui Correctional for weapons possession.
He's currently a person of interest
in an unrelated homicide.
The weapon was never found.
So, what's he got to do with my father's case?
When I ran a ballistics comparison
to the bullet that killed your dad,
I got a hit to the Doran investigation.
See, I think the first thing
that Hesse did when he got on the island
was hook up with Doran and get a gun.
And maybe Doran still knows where he is,
so let's go talk to him.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Excuse me.
Are you suffering from dementia?
This is no longer my case.
The Captain said you transferred in from New Jersey
six months ago, so your eye's still fresh.
You know, I appreciate it,
but my psych eval's not for six weeks.
Fold-out bed, no ring on your finger.
You obviously moved here to be close to your daughter.
Which means in between visits, all you got
is your job and you take pride in it.
That's what I'm looking for.
Yeah, but you know what?
It's guys like you, they think they know how
to do everything better, and that only makes my job harder.
You got no choice, Detective.
Governor gave me jurisdiction. I'm making you my partner.
We're gonna get along great.
I take it your marriage didn't end too well.
No.
It would have had my ex not remarried
and dragged my daughter to this pineapple-infested hellhole.
You don't like the beach?
I don't like the beach.
Who doesn't like the beach?
I like, uh, cities, you know.
Skyscrapers,
no tsunamis, no jellyfish.
Tell me you can swim.
Can I swim?
You don't know how to swim.
I know how... I swim-- I swim for survival, not for fun.
All right.
Yes, dear?
Hey, monkey.
No, no, no,
I thought you were your mom.
I am so glad that everybody liked Mr. Hoppy.
I'm excited too, baby.
We're gonna have so much fun this weekend.
Danno loves you.
Who's Danno?
Don't.
Just...
Okay.
Thank you.
This guy Doran's a shooter, all right?
We shouldn't be doing this without backup.
You are the backup.
I'm the backup.
I hate him. I hate him so much.
Hey. Hey, slow down, huh?
You ruined my life!
You know what, you need to be quiet. Sit down!
Get your ass back here!
Tracy? Tracy?
Danny! Go! Go! Go!
Put your gun down! We don't have to do this, man.
I said put the gun down!
You sold a weapon to a man named Victor Hesse.
I'm not after you. I want him.
I'm not talking to you!
Where is he?
I said I'm not talking to you!
Now put the gun down, or I'll kill her!
You don't think I'll do it?
I'll do it!
I'll kill her right now!
I hope it hurts!
Careful, she bites.
It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's okay. What's your name?
Okay, so she was smuggled in four days ago
in a cargo ship from China,
with her parents, a couple hundred refugees.
She gets here, she's traded to Doran.
Okay, excuse me, I'm sorry,
this is typically where you would, uh,
say "Thank you" for saving your life.
You just shot my only lead.
Are you kidding me?
Are you kidding me?
These are the same guys
that are moving people out of Asia.
They could've smuggled Hesse into Hawaii.
You just took a stupid risk, okay?
Understand that.
I am not getting myself killed
for your vendetta.
I have a daughter, okay?
Yeah, that girl there is someone's daughter, too.
You don't get it. You don't get it.
I mean, for somebody who just lost his father,
You're pretty dense.
What'd you just say?
What'd you just say to me! What if she was yours, huh?
Is there anything that you
would not do to hunt down the son of a bitch
that did that to her and killed her?
Do not question my resolve...
One warning. Take your finger out of my face.
Listen to me, you son of a bitch!
Aah! What did I tell you?
I warned you.
What are you, a ninja? Let go.
In front of all these nice people. It's fine.
Go back to work. It's fine.
Now, you don't have to like me,
but right now, there's no one else to do this job.
Okay. Let me go.
All right, look, we need to find these human trafficker...
You're right, I don't like you.
Son of a...
How's the arm?
Let's just not talk.
You mean right now or ever again?
Just both, okay?
You know, I think... I think I might know why
your wife left you.
Really?
Yeah, you're very sensitive.
I'm sensitive, huh? Yeah.
You think I'm sensitive?
Well, a little bit, you know.
When did you come to the conclusion that I was sensitive, huh?
Was it when a bullet was tearing through my flesh,
is that when I seemed sensitive to you?
Huh? I am really happy
that you are not afraid of anything. Okay?
I'm glad that you have that GI Joe
thousand-yard stare
from chasing shoe-bombers around the world, okay?
But in civilized society, we have rules, all right?
It is the unspoken glue
that separates us from jackals and hyenas,
all right?
Jackals and hyenas.
Animal Planet, whatever.
Okay? The point is,
rule number one:
If you get somebody shot, you apologize!
I'm sorry.
You don't wait for a special occasion.
I'm sorry. Okay?
Like birthdays,
I'm sorry.
Frickin' President's Day...
Hey, man, I'm sorry, okay?
I said I'm sorry, sincerely sorry.
That's what I was trying to tell you last year
when this conversation first started.
Your, uh... apology is noted.
Acceptance is pending.
You let me know, now.
Yeah. I'll let you know.
Make the next left up here.
Why?
I think I know someone who can help us.
Her name is Chen-Chi.
Where'd you find her?
Locked in a house.
She came here to start a new life.
They drugged her and turned her into a prostitute.
The guy we're looking for is high-profile: Victor Hesse.
CIA, FBI, Interpol-- he's on everyone's radar.
Which means he didn't just land here
and get his passport stamped-- he was back-channeled in.
Mm. And you think the same network
that brought this girl to the island smuggled Hesse in.
Well, he made a fortune trafficking kids out of Malaysia, so...
Then you're looking for a snakehead.
Local Chinese gangs that specialize in human smuggling.
Okay, we need a name.
Are you kidding? Look at me.
I'm a rubber gun now.
Come on, you were on the force for 15 years.
Okay, look, I know a guy who's got ties to that world.
Great. Get us an intro.
Forget it.
He's a former confidential informant.
He trusts no one.
Especially haoles.
You talk to him, then.
I'm busy.
You're busy? What, you expecting
a crime wave in the gift shop this afternoon?
Look... I can't be a cop anymore.
Why not?
Because I can't be!
You understand?
HPD accused me of taking payoffs.
So I'm the last person the department wants to see
wearing a badge.
I got to go.
This is going really well.
Did you take the money?
Excuse me?
Did you...
take the money?
No.
Then come with us...
and we don't need to talk about this again.
Ever.
This is your ticket back into the game.
Call it payback, call it whatever you want,
I don't care, but I need you.
How do you know you can trust me?
Because my old man did.
Hey, Kamekona!
How's it...?
Good to see you, my brother.
Hey, bro.
I need a name.
Hey, wait out there.
After they pay.
Two cones, two T-shirts to go.
Medium.
X-L and up, brah.
My face don't fit on anything smaller.
How much kala, bulleh?
You speak bird, huh?
Yeah, I grew up here.
Don't matter, you still look hauli to me.
This one feels a little bit lonely, brah.
Cool!
One more thing-- I need you two fine
white gentlemens to do.
Are you a cop?
No.
Well, you look like a cop.
You like cotton candy? Go find your mom.
I don't like cotton candy.
I got something you might like, okay?
How about...
How about that?
Yeah.
Thanks.
You're welcome.
What?
You'd better have a name.
Sang Min.
Came here from China eight years ago,
and according to my man Kamekona,
he runs the island's human import/export business.
So Hesse could've used him to get on or off the island.
So let's say this guy's for real.
Still got no reason to tell us where Hesse is.
Well, we find some leverage, twist his arm.
Define leverage.
Simple bait-and-trap.
Wire up an undercover,
send him in.
Only one problem, malihini.
That might work well on the mainland,
but we're on an island with less than a million people.
Which means the bad guys know the good guys.
So we need to look for our bait outside the box.
I take it you have the perfect guy in mind?
Oh, yeah.
That's your cousin?
Choose your next words carefully,
both of you.
Well, she's very talented.
Oh, she's off the charts.
Spent three years on the pro circuit before
she blew out her knee.
The kid was devastated.
Had to reinvent herself, and decided to wear a badge.
Graduates from the police academy in a week.
Unfortunately, she's family,
which means the HPD will never take her seriously.
Hey! Watch out!
You sure she's ready for this?
She's got no street experience.
Ho, brah.
Think twice next time you want to drop in on someone's wave.
Cousin!
Oh, you had him,
Water Woman!
Double-overheads.
Waste. First good pipe of the season.
Tourists-- what you gonna do?
Kono, meet Commander Steve McGarrett
and Detective Danny Williams.
Nice right cross.
Nah, man, that was a love tap.
Hi.
That's good, brah.
Sure.
So, your cousin tells us
you're graduating from the police academy next week.
How'd you like to earn a little extra credit before you do?
I'm listening.
Just spoke to Chin-- he's setting up the meet with Sang Min.
I got that surveillance equipment you asked for.
You recognize this guy?
No. Who is it?
Jovan Etienne.
File says he worked for the Russians
as a computer programmer in SVR.
He was here when my father was murdered.
I found his palm prints
in the study, partial boot prints in here.
Wait a minute, how do you know
the boot print didn't belong to Hesse?
Hesse wears a size 11, like me, except double-E.
The prints I found were smaller,
and Hesse gets his footwear custom-made.
Direct-injected polyurethane mid-sole
with a nitrile rubber outsole.
Oh.
Your, uh, brain must be a...
miserable place.
I need a beer.
You ever gonna tell me what Danno means?
Yeah, when you tell me what's in the box.
Truth is, I don't know yet.
All I know...
is that my father wanted me to find it.
Right now it's just a puzzle.
You know, me and Grace, we like puzzles.
You're a good father.
Yeah, maybe, I don't know. You know?
There's three ways of looking at it. One...
could get myself killed chasing some meth-head scumbag,
and then what kind of father would I be?
I always looked up to my father for that.
You know, the sacrifices he made.
I'm sure Grace is gonna feel the same way.
Yeah, maybe.
Either that, or she may think
I'm just a selfish son of a bitch.
You know, the truth is, this is all I got, I need this.
I want to do what I'm good at,
I want to be reminded I'm good at what I do.
If that means... having to put up
with your twisted belief that you are never wrong,
so be it.
So what's the third?
Well, even if I tell myself this isn't permanent...
...it's Gracie's home now.
It's my job to keep it safe.
Yeah?
All right.
Good work.
What do you got?
That was Chin.
Sang Min bought the pitch and meets Kono tomorrow morning.
All right, still no guarantee he's gonna tell us where Hesse is.
He has to.
This is the only chance I have
of finding the man who killed my father.
All right, guys, Kono's in play.
Here we go.
Okay, kid, just get him to say how
he's smuggling these people off the island.
My friend says you need my help.
I have an aunt and uncle in Nanjing.
They would very much like to live here.
I can have your family here within a week.
Getting them out of China's easy.
Paying for it, that's the hard part.
I have money.
Do you mind if I ask what you do?
I work at the cannery on Pacific...
and weekends as a housekeeper at the Royal Hawaiian.
Two jobs?
Very commendable.
Only I'm afraid the kind of money we're talking about
might be out of your reach.
Unless, of course,
we find some other form of payment.
Sand.
What kind of person working two jobs
has time to go to the beach?
All right, that's it. Pull the plug.
Let's get her out of there.
Relax. The kid can handle herself.
Hey, he smells trap,
he's gonna kill her, all right?
Trust me.
I surf during my lunch hour.
Or maybe you're a cop.
Did anyone check her for a wire?
We checked her when she came in.
Maybe you missed it.
Take off your dress so I know you're not wearing a wire.
Turn around.
I'd like to put my dress back on now.
What are...? What are you doing?
I'm going to send this photo to a friend of mine.
Okay, we got a wire on that phone.
Trace the call, Danny.
And he's going to show it to his friends.
If anyone recognizes you...
Mobile number. Unlisted.
...you're dead.
Got a location?
Danny?
Ringing inside my precinct.
You got a mole in there.
She's a cop.
We got to move.
You're early.
You all right?
Down! Down on the floor! Now! Down!
Put your hands behind your back.
Hey! Let me see your hands!
Gun!
Get down!
Anybody hurt?
Good!
Good!
Good.
Keep your hands on the steering wheel.
Out of the car right now.
Hands behind your head.
We're clear.
We got movement over here.
Go ahead.
Go ahead. I got you.
Danny.
Getting them out of China's easy.
Paying for it-- that's the hard part.
Laser Audio Surveillance.
You don't need a wire
to get a confession out of your hupo ass.
I'm going to sue you for entrapment.
And when I'm done collecting,
I'm going to find that little hottie you sent in here,
and this time, I'm going to be less of a gentleman.
Sorry, boss.
I didn't see anything.
You didn't see anything?!
Son of a bitch hit me!
You want to file a report, you're going to need a witness.
Do you want to file a report?
I want to go to jail now.
Where is he?
Where's Hesse?
What about your wife and kid?
You know where they are?
I do.
She's getting her nails done on Kalakaua Avenue.
And your boy is at his private school
in Diamond Head.
You know, I wonder what he's gonna think
when he finds out that Daddy takes kids just like him
and puts them on the street
to be pumped full of black tar heroin,
and then sold to strangers like animals.
You're going to jail.
That part's not up for negotiation.
Your family is about to lose a husband and a father.
In my eyes, now they're your victims, too.
The trouble is, the law doesn't see it that way.
Your wife-- she's from Rwanda.
She'll be sent back.
They both will.
If they're lucky,
they'll make it to a refugee camp.
And your son?
Seven's old enough to hold a gun for the Hutu Militia.
I can prevent all that.
But I don't help people who don't help me.
What kind of cops are you?
The new kind.
Okay. Okay.
Sang Min put Hesse and Etienne on a cargo ship
headed for China-- The Emma Karl.
Steve, do not even think of...
Governor, you wanted a task force
that would do whatever was necessary.
You promised me immunity
and means.
No, no. Not... Not to provoke a diplomatic incident
by boarding a Chinese freighter
headed for international waters.
If China is caught smuggling a terrorist,
trust me, they won't say a word.
I did my job, Governor.
I found Hesse. Now you do yours.
Tell the Coast Guard to block the port.
That ship is not going anywhere.
Son of a bitch. Yeah.
Rachel.
Rachel, don't start with me.
I left you two messages,
telling you you need to pick her up.
Don't tell me you had to change your plans.
You send a driver for her half the time anyway.
I can't... I can't do that right now.
I'm in the middle of something.
Please stop for a second.
Can you just do me one favor?
Just tell Gra...
Tell Grace Danno loves her, all right?
Okay.
Gracie was three, she'd try to say my name,
and all that she could say was Danno.
That's all that came out. Danno. Okay?
That's it?
That's it. That's it.
It's cute.
Shut up.
Why-Why... Why can't I think it's cute?
Don't... Because...because
I don't need you thinking anything about us.
It's between me and my daughter.
All right.
There it is-- The Emma Karl.
Taking off. How do you want to do this?!
Right.
Hold on.
All right.
All right.
All right!
Cover me. I'm gonna find Hesse.
Go! Go!
There's something you should know about your brother.
What about him?
He died the same way you did.
Put your hands behind your back.
Don't make me shoot you again.
Get the Coast Guard to find that body.
What do you want me to do with this one?
Book 'em, Danno.
What did I tell you about that?
Where are you trying to go?
Where are you...? Where? Where? Where? Go ahead.
Do you want me to shoot you?
Stop. Just stop.
What, uh... What is this?
Three nights at the Kahala Hotel.
Look, I know you're gonna say no...
Yeah. You're right, I'm gonna say no.
What is it with you and my living arrangements?
Gracie's coming over this weekend, right?
Yeah.
Okay. So, I hear this place has a pool,
you can swim with the dolphins. Just take it.
Oh, you look, uh...
You look really bad.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Thank you.
Okay, guys, honestly, I think we need a name.
A name?
What kind of name?
What are you talking about?
Yeah, like, something to call ourselves.
What do you think?
Why do we need a name?
Because we're gonna be working together, and it'd be cool.
I got it.
A'ohe hana nui ka alu'ia.
You, too. What?
What are you laughing at? Come on.
That means, "no task is too big when done together."
This is the problem
with you haoles-- no team spirit.
No island spirit.
No, honestly. Come on.
Be something cool like Strike Force.
Strike Force?
Yes. Strike Force.
I hate that so much.
