vampires and werewolves used to roam freely
until a shaman put a curse on them to limit their power .
since then , werewolves can only turn on a full moon ,
and vampires are weakened by the sun .
the werewolf part of the curse , it &apos;s sealed with the moonstone .
you must be elena .
how do we look exactly alike ?
you &apos;re a petrova doppelganger .
you &apos;re the key to breaking the curse .
you know my daughter elena .
it &apos;s getting really easy being you .
i don &apos;t want you here .
we all want the same thing , klaus dead .
the oldest vampire in the history of time is coming after me ?
elijah had no weapon to kill klaus ,
but he believed that if a witch could channel enough power ,
they wouldn &apos;t need one .
like the power you could get from a spot
marked with a hundred dead witches .
i &apos;m a vampire .
i can &apos;t let you leave , ok , not like this .
what did you do to my sister ?
jenna keeps asking about isobel .
isobel is dead .
hi . you must be jenna .
i am elena &apos;s mother .
isobel .
hello , elena .
it &apos;s nice to see you again .
again ?
so you &apos;re the woman who &apos;s dating my husband .
i need to speak to elena . may i come in ?
n @-@ n @-@ no . don &apos;t--
don &apos;t invite her in .
i need to talk to you , elena .
no .
you knew she was still alive ?
rick ? john ?
did they know ?
i can explain everything , jenna .
no .
no . jenna , please .
jenna , please .
no , wait . jenna , please wait .
jenna , you have to talk to me . i--
i need to explain what &apos;s going on .
jenna , please .
she just showed up at their front doorstep .
what &apos;s she doing here ?
i don &apos;t know . that &apos;s what i &apos;m gonna go find out .
i don &apos;t think that you should tell her
that i &apos;m here .
what ?
why ?
it &apos;s better if she and john not know
that i stayed in town after i got out of the tomb .
you &apos;re the one in cahoots with them .
you made a deal with john that almost got me killed .
i did what i had to to get out of the tomb .
now i &apos;m reconsidering my alliance .
what do you know ?
i know that i want klaus dead ,
which puts me squarely on team you .
besides , if you two ever need me
to swap places with elena again ,
the less people know that i &apos;m here , the better .
think about it , stefan . come on . be smart .
tell you what . you two , uh ...
call alaric and let him know that his wife &apos;s
just showed up on his girlfriend &apos;s doorstep .
hey . is she up yet ?
she won &apos;t come out of her room .
what &apos;d you tell her ?
nothing . she won &apos;t talk to me .
we &apos;re gonna have to fix this , elena .
jenna .
i don &apos;t want you here , rick . you need to go .
ok , listen . i can &apos;t begin to imagine
what you must be feeling right now .
rage and betrayal would pretty much cover it .
where are you going ?
i &apos;m going to stay on campus .
i have a thesis to write , and i don &apos;t want to be in this house .
jenna , please just stop .
let us explain to you exactly what is going on .
elena , i need you to go to the lockwoods &apos; today
and accept the historical society &apos;s check
for your mom &apos;s foundation .
ok , but , jenna , please just--
i don &apos;t have it in me to hear any more lies from you .
jenna , just--
let her go .
it &apos;s better that she &apos;s not here ,
what with everything that &apos;s going on .
but maybe had you been a little more honest with her from the beginning , this--
sorry , elena .
you know this is your fault , right ?
right .
i can &apos;t find him anywhere .
he &apos;s not at home . he &apos;s not answering his phone .
how could you let him go ?
my mom walked in . he took off .
i didn &apos;t know what to do .
did your mom hear anything ?
no . she just thinks we &apos;re fighting ,
but he knows about me ,
and he &apos;s freaking out about vicki .
all right . listen .
you have to find him .
you have to calm him down .
compel him if you have to .
is he still on the vervain ?
i slip it into his soda when he &apos;s at work ,
but i didn &apos;t get to last night , so it &apos;s out of his system .
he has a catering shift at the lockwoods &apos; today .
i &apos;m gonna try there .
call matt .
calling matt .
you reached matt . leave a message .
ah , this is bad .
between isobel and jenna and now matt ,
this is disaster bad .
yeah .
elena , can you come downstairs , please ?
i need to talk to you .
heh . i have nothing to say to you .
please . it &apos;s important .
you , too , stefan .
i asked john for a do @-@ over .
you invited her in ?
she has information about klaus .
please , just listen to her , ok ?
all right . what do you know ?
since i was last here ,
i &apos;ve been doing everything possible to find klaus .
we knew our best chance was to
find him before he could find you .
best chance at what ?
keeping elena alive .
you don &apos;t get to talk , ok .
not after everything you &apos;ve done .
were you able to find klaus ?
no . nobody knows where he is ,
but there are these rumors that are flying around
that a doppelganger exists .
which means any vampires
want to get enviable with klaus
will be lining up to catch you .
i &apos;m not buying any of this .
the last time that you were here ,
you made it clear that you didn &apos;t give a damn about me .
now all of a sudden
i &apos;m supposed to believe that you want to help ?
isobel &apos;s been helping all along .
klaus has been obsessed with
finding katherine for centuries .
all it would take was any one of those 1864 tomb vampires
to spread the word around that katherine was still alive .
and it would bring him straight here to mystic falls ,
where you were bound to be discovered ,
so we killed them .
and almost killed stefan and damon in the process .
yeah .
i have a safe house that i can take you to .
the deed is in your name .
no vampires can get in without your permission ,
not even me .
let me help you .
you wanna help ?
then get the hell out of my house .
yep . everybody &apos;s dead .
we should pack up the grimoires .
they spent years collecting them .
i wanna make sure they &apos;re safe .
you know , we could just get another match and cremate &apos; em .
don &apos;t be disrespectful .
not to him .
fine . i &apos;ll bury him .
what exactly are we looking for ?
according to luka &apos;s dad ,
one of these contains a spell
that &apos;ll let me harness the energy that &apos;s left behind
when a witch dies violently .
i didn &apos;t know you and father witch were so close .
we weren &apos;t .
but when he gave me my powers back ,
he gave me a message .
if i can find the spot in town ,
where the old salem witches were burned ,
i can harness their energy to use when i need it .
great .
we &apos;ll have to put that on our list of things to do today .
harness ancient dead @-@ witch power .
you know where the witches were burned ?
did i forget to mention that ?
are we gonna have to read through
every one of these books till we find the right spell ?
not exactly .
it &apos;s this one .
great . grab the rest .
let &apos;s go .
merci , mon cherie .
nice house .
nicest foreclosure in town .
come here .
it &apos;s good to see you , katherine .
i hear you &apos;ve been busy .
yes , i have .
i &apos;ve been busy making a deal with klaus
to save your life .
here .
a vintner i knew in avignon .
he &apos;s tasty .
so what was with the surprise visit to the gilbert house ?
john told me rick was dating auntie vanilla .
i got jealous .
you have obviously got john wrapped around your finger .
if he invited you in the house .
he thinks i &apos;m helping him protect elena ,
so he &apos;s been very useful in keeping me informed
on everything that &apos;s been going on .
so tell me what you know .
you were right . i couldn &apos;t get anywhere near klaus ,
but i found my way to someone in his trusted circle .
one of his witches .
klaus and his witches .
he said that klaus is willing to grant you your freedom ,
if we deliver the moonstone and the doppelganger .
i can get the moonstone .
no , katherine ,
you &apos;d be betraying your salvatore boys again .
i was more than willing to play it their way if i had to ,
but they &apos;re floundering .
their witch has lost her powers ,
and they &apos;ve used their only weapon to kill elijah .
if i stick with them , i &apos;m dead .
you showing up change everything .
do you really think that isobel &apos;s telling the truth
that word &apos;s gotten out about the doppelganger ?
look , i don &apos;t trust a word that she says ,
but i think we &apos;d be stupid to ignore the warning .
you should just stay here .
it &apos;s better for us to keep an eye on you .
what , in the house that any vampire can enter ? no .
her house is safer .
well , then we &apos;ll stay there .
so is that the plan ?
neither of you will let me out of your sight again ?
let me know when you come up with a better one .
fine . then one of you two bodyguards
is gonna have to come with me to the lockwood luncheon .
that &apos;d be me .
not me . i have witch stuff
to attend to with bonnie .
does that mean that you &apos;re taking her to the--
don &apos;t get quiet on my account .
if you have a plan
to combat the impending vampire doom ,
please do tell .
seriously , what is the plan
to get us out of this mess ?
i delivered you a moonstone ,
a werewolf , and the dagger to lure and kill klaus ,
and right now all you have is a moonstone .
or so you tell me .
no , we have it .
where is it ?
it &apos;s in a very safe place .
i &apos;ve been honest with you . time to return the favor .
let me be honest with you . don &apos;t mistake the fact
that we haven &apos;t set you on fire in your sleep for trust .
fine .
be that way .
the marshal hasn &apos;t been able to figure out
what caused the fire at the scene ,
but he did find blood--
no body , just blood .
you think vampires were involved ?
i &apos;m staring to assume the answer to that
is always a yes .
mrs. lockwood , have you seen matt ?
i thought he was working a catering shift at today &apos;s brunch .
no , i haven &apos;t , honey . sorry .
but if you see him ,
could you ask if he &apos;s heard from tyler ?
yeah , of course .
still no word from him ?
no . the note he left said
he needed time to figure some things out ,
but i wish i knew where he was .
excuse me .
any luck finding matt ?
none . what if he tells somebody ?
what if he tells everybody ?
no , we just gotta find him
and make sure that doesn &apos;t happen .
do you have any idea where he would be ?
i wish i did ,
but he wasn &apos;t really one to run .
you know , this wasn &apos;t how it was supposed to happen .
you know , i was supposed to tell him at the right moment
in the right way , and he was supposed
to be ok with it because he loves me .
we &apos;ll help you find him .
i just have to accept this thing for jenna .
all right . well , call me when you &apos;re done ,
and i &apos;ll be out looking for him .
maybe he &apos;ll come around .
you did .
is this the spot emily bennett was killed , too ?
founders thought it was poetic .
burning her where the other witches burned .
how do you know where the witches were burned ?
&apos;cause i tried to save her .
emily was just my key to getting katherine back
before i knew what a nasty little bitch katherine was .
you &apos;re sure it &apos;s the right place ?
whatever witchy prank you &apos;re playing , don &apos;t .
it &apos;s not funny .
i &apos;m not doing anything .
i can &apos;t move .
oh , my ring &apos;s not working .
do something .
i don &apos;t think the witches like you being here .
i guess this is the right place .
i &apos;m gonna go wait outside .
hi , rick .
isobel .
what do you want ?
just cleaning up some loose ends .
yeah , we don &apos;t have any loose ends .
you may not . i do .
i need to apologize to you .
it &apos;s a little late for that .
no , not for what i &apos;ve done in the past .
we &apos;re beyond that .
although i am sorry for outing you to your girlfriend .
that was pitty of me .
look , whatever jack @-@ up vampire amends
that you &apos;re trying to make with me right now , i &apos;m not interested .
of course not , because i compelled you to let me go .
i realize that i don &apos;t wanna do what i have to do
without you knowing how much i loved you .
and i did .
i loved you so much .
he &apos;s all yours .
wanna hurry it up in there ?
screw you , too , emily .
you know , you &apos;re on your own in there .
can you hand me the grimoire ?
look , are you sure about this ?
are you worried about me ?
yeah , of course i am .
i &apos;m sure .
what is that ?
spirits of the witches who died here ,
i can feel them .
all right . what are they saying ?
i can &apos;t--can &apos;t tell .
ah , great .
where are you going ?
here .
this is it .
help me set the candles .
what the hell are they saying ?
what is it ?
nothing .
they &apos;re ready .
and here to accept the donation
to the miranda sommers gilbert scholarship fund
is elena gilbert .
what are you doing here ?
i &apos;m creating a distraction .
the historical society was my mom &apos;s baby .
she considered all of you family
and would be honored and touched by this gift .
what &apos;s going on ? is he all right ?
nice dress .
mind if i borrow it ?
please , let the sheriff do her job .
uh , he &apos;s--he &apos;s bleeding . is he ok ?
yeah , i got it . i got it .
you know what ? let &apos;s all back off .
all right ? he just needs some air . everything &apos;s fine .
elena .
elena .
you ok ?
i &apos;m calling damon .
let &apos;s get out of here . come on .
it &apos;s isobel , damon . it &apos;s gotta be .
tell him he needs to get over here and deal with john &apos;s body .
you &apos;ve got some serious explaining to do to the council
about john being not so dead .
where the hell is she ? huh ?
i &apos;m sorry , stef , but i can &apos;t have you following me .
oh , god .
bonnie ?
you &apos;re scaring me .
bonnie !
you ok ?
i did it .
it &apos;s ok .
i &apos;m sorry for the scare .
it was just a bad fall .
paramedics are on their way .
how is he ?
he &apos;s dead .
he &apos;ll be fine in a couple hours .
what are you talking about ? damon , he &apos;s dead .
here &apos;s the thing .
john &apos;s ring , it &apos;s an old gilbert family heirloom
that protects its owner from death
by a supernatural entity .
but he &apos;s not breathing . he has no pulse .
he will be . trust me .
we &apos;re gonna need a cover story--
epileptic fit , alcohol binge ,
banana peel , whatever works .
but right now i just have to get him out of here .
yeah .
it &apos;s a false alarm at the lockwoods &apos; .
ok . good . thanks .
sheriff forbes .
matt , what &apos;s wrong ?
i wanna see vicki &apos;s file .
what ?
my sister .
i want to see her file .
i want to see how you covered up
that she was killed by a vampire .
matt , you need to calm down . you &apos;re upset .
you don &apos;t know what are you talking .
don &apos;t lie to me .
matt , you need to calm down now .
stefan ? how &apos;d i beat you and elena home ?
what ?
no , no .
are we good to go ?
i &apos;m at your house , but we have to hurry .
damon knows your lodging tricks .
it will take him all of 20 minutes to find out where you &apos;re staying .
we &apos;ll be long gone before that .
good . how far are you ?
i &apos;m sorry , katherine .
i had to do what i was told .
he wanted the moonstone , and he wanted you .
he ?
he who ?
hey , matt , if you &apos;re listening to this ,
that means you &apos;ve listened to the last 25 messages i &apos;ve left you ,
which all say the same thing , so ...
call me .
you &apos;re here .
your mom brought me here .
my mom ?
i accused her of covering up vicki &apos;s death ,
and she threatened to arrest me .
did you tell her anything else ?
nothing about you .
i got the feeling she wasn &apos;t gonna believe anything i said ,
so i shut up .
then she brought me here to cool down ,
and then she got called away .
matt ...
why &apos;d you stick around if you &apos;re still scared of me ?
because i need to know more
about vicki ,
about you ,
i &apos;ll tell you anything you wanna know .
all right , well , there has to be something in the grimoire to help us translate that chant .
it was just a warning .
heh . what kind of warning ?
it &apos;s not important .
uh , like , it is important to me , ok ?
it &apos;s a lot of power to have access to .
they &apos;re just telling me to be careful with it .
well , exactly how much power
can you draw from a hundred dead witches ?
bonnie .
the answer to your question is a lot .
think this is the house ?
better be . it &apos;s the nicest foreclosure in town .
swear to god if she &apos;s not here--
don &apos;t be such a pessimist .
i got upstairs .
this is isobel &apos;s stuff .
it &apos;s definitely the right place .
where are they ?
i don &apos;t know , stefan .
just because you can &apos;t be compelled
doesn &apos;t mean i can &apos;t force you to come with me .
so is that what happened ?
you were compelled
to betray katherine ?
if i was , i couldn &apos;t tell you .
so you lied .
you did find klaus , didn &apos;t you ?
he knows where i am now .
are you taking me to him ?
what is this ?
my parents ,
your grandparents ,
they put it here when it became clear
that the police weren &apos;t gonna find my body .
they visit every week , and they bring flowers ,
even though there &apos;s no one buried here .
the isobel they knew is dead .
so maybe there &apos;s a part of
me that &apos;s buried here , the--the human part ,
the part that i abandoned
when i--when i choose to become a vampire ,
the part that used to dream
about the day that she &apos;d know her daughter .
what ?
and instead you got to meet the other part ...
the part that would betray her own flesh and blood .
i have katherine and the moonstone .
is the doppelganger safe ?
yes .
then let her go .
let her go ?
klaus has everything he needs for now .
your part is finished .
you &apos;ll do what you are compelled to do .
i &apos;m done ?
you &apos;re done .
who was that ?
i &apos;m so sorry , elena ...
that i was such a disappointment to you .
so after i hurt you in the woods ,
i made you forget ,
and i promised myself i would stay away from you ,
but i--i couldn &apos;t ...
&apos;cause i love you .
i do . i love you , matt , so much .
god , i &apos;m so sorry about what happened to vicki .
and i really wish you &apos;d say something .
i &apos;m all alone .
no , you &apos;re not .
my mom doesn &apos;t care ,
my sister &apos;s dead ,
and all of my friends are liars ,
and you &apos;re a--
i &apos;m still me . i &apos;m still me .
it &apos;s just i &apos;m just a little bit--
don &apos;t . no . this is too much .
all of this is just too much .
i don &apos;t want to know this .
tell me what i can do .
tell me what i can do . i--
i want to help you .
you can make me forget .
you &apos;ve done it to me before .
i don &apos;t--i don &apos;t think that that &apos;s--
please make me forget , caroline .
i don &apos;t wanna look at you
and see what i &apos;m seeing right now .
but maybe after--
just make me forget , caroline !
ok .
ok , matt .
is that isobel &apos;s ?
i never thought i would feel bad about her being dead , and yet ...
she was your mother .
why did they let me go ?
well , anything john told isobel ,
we have to assume that klaus knows , right ?
so he knows that you &apos;re not gonna turn yourself into a vampire .
he knows that you have us keeping you safe .
he knows i &apos;m not gonna run .
which is why we need to take some precautions ,
&apos;cause we got played ,
all of us .
what &apos;s this ?
it &apos;s the deed to our house .
it &apos;s in zach &apos;s name .
as soon as you sign it , it &apos;ll be in your name .
you &apos;re giving me your house ?
isobel had the right idea with the safe house .
you &apos;ll just stay here till it &apos;s all over .
that way , you can control who gets invited and who doesn &apos;t .
although i &apos;ll be super pissed if you lock me out .
i swear i had no idea what she was gonna do .
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m so , so sorry .
damon , let him go .
he and i need to talk .
i told you to not worry about that .
a warning-- that &apos;s all you felt like telling me ?
this is some kind of warning , bonnie .
it says if you use too much of your powers at once ,
it &apos;ll kill you .
how much would it take to kill an original ?
all of it .
no .
i &apos;m not gonna let you do that .
jeremy , do you think i was born with these powers
so i could float feathers and blow out candles ?
there &apos;s a reason i was called to do this .
no one &apos;s called to get themselves killed .
plus elena &apos;s not gonna let you die for her .
that &apos;s why you &apos;re not gonna tell her .
do you even understand what you &apos;re saying right now ?
it &apos;s not just for elena , jeremy .
it &apos;s for you .
it &apos;s for everyone .
if i am the only one who can put an end to this ,
then it &apos;ll be my decision , no one else &apos;s .
mine .
i did it .
i drank that vervain stuff .
i went over there , and i got her to tell me everything .
then i asked her to take it away .
thank you , matt .
i know this isn &apos;t easy , but ...
i &apos;m glad you told me what happened last night .
i want you to tell me everything she said .
i feel like she died .
she did .
i always knew that she and katherine were close ,
but i never realized that isobel and her were working against me .
two of the world &apos;s most uncaring and selfish vampires ,
and yet they were genuinely friends .
if that &apos;s what you thought of her ,
why did you ever put your trust in her at all ?
because i was there when she gave birth to you , elena .
i saw how heartbroken she was to give you up .
and because she was the first girl i ever loved ,
and when she said she &apos;d help keep you safe ...
i believed her .
at this point , i will do whatever you want me to do .
if you feel safer with me not around ,
then i &apos;ll go .
you screw up everything , john .
everything you touch just falls apart .
but you &apos;re the only parent i have left .
so maybe i can learn not to hate you .
ok .
hey , bonnie said the spell worked .
she &apos;s locked and loaded .
at least something went right today .
katherine has no idea that bonnie got her powers back .
and isobel had no idea
what you and jeremy took bonnie to do today .
we &apos;re the only ones who know .
that literally makes bonnie our secret weapon .
alaric ?
zdravei , katerina .
i have missed you .
