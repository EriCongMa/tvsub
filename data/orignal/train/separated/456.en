Look, a while back, I had some medical issues--
headaches--and there was a geneticist that I reached out to.
I guess I just-- I think it's funny
how we've been doing this for 6 months and we've never met.
Do you--do you think he knows about us?
As far as I can tell he doesn't.
Well, guess I'll talk to you next Sunday.
Bye. Love you.
But if you've got somebody new in your life to talk to...
I'd just like to know who she is.
She's gotta be one hell of a woman to keep up with you.
I think the stalker's gone.
The e-mails have stopped.
What about the phone calls?
No, I haven't gotten any.
No more heavy breathing on the machine,
no more hang-ups.
Is this about... phone booth girl?
She wants to meet.
Wait. You guys have never met?
Aren't you curious what she looks like?
Oh, it doesn't matter what she looks like.
I mean, she's already the most beautiful girl in the world to me.
Hello.
Maeve, it's me. Listen, don't come to the restaurant.
What are you talking about? I'm outside.
Go home.
Look, I think your stalker's here.
Have you the ring?
Place the ring on her finger.
On whose finger?
I now pronounce you smart
and smarter.
Let's get to it, you two.
Get to what?
Kiss her, dummy.
Hello.
Hello. I have a collect call from...
Adam Worth.
Do you accept the charges?
Yes.
Please deposit $2.00 for the first two minutes.
Thank you.
Hello, I'm still here.
Zug... Zwang.
I'm sorry, can you please repeat that?
Zug... Zwang
I got here as quickly as I could.
What's wrong?
I need to tell you something.
Our correspondence started 10 months ago.
She wrote me a compliment
on my "Journal of Behavioral Psych" article,
and for 3 months, this is
how we communicated because she was scared.
Scared of whom?
She didn't know, only that he was dangerous.
Horribly threatening phone calls,
letters, e-mails no matter where she moved.
It's why I never called her from the same phone booth twice.
You don't know what Maeve looks like?
No.
Or where she works?
No, I know she's a geneticist.
Do you even know her last name?
Then I have to ask you, how do you know she's missing?
Because we always addressed our letters to pseudonyms.
And you're Dr. Joseph Bell?
The real life inspiration for Sherlock Holmes.
And that codename is how I know she's in trouble.
The voice on the phone identified himself as Adam Worth.
That was the American criminal that
Arthur Conan Doyle based the character of Moriarty on.
And what did he say to you?
Zug Zwang.
It's a chess term,
it describes the point in a game
when a player realizes he'll inevitably be checkmated.
He has to decide whether to resign
or to play through to the bitter end.
If you're right about this,
then you're part of his victiology, too.
I know.
He thinks he'll get away with this,
and he might.
I have a wealth of knowledge
I should be applying to this case.
Behavioral patterns of violent stalkers.
Tactical recovery strategies.
Victim survival odds.
But right now I can't focus on anything
more than 4 seconds at a time.
Which makes me the dumbest person in the room.
So...
please help me.
Help me find her.
We don't know if we have a case.
So we'll be working on personal time.
Does anybody want to leave?
Good.
Let's get to work.
Deeply loved by someone gives you strength,
while loving someone deeply gives you courage."
Lao Tsu.
Based on Maeve's description of the unsub in her letters,
he seems like a classically possessive stalker.
One who craves validation and recognition.
"What won't you see me?"
"Do you think you're better than me?"
This comes up again and again.
So does his suicidal ideation.
"When I find you, I'm going to kill you, then myself."
Murder-suicide is the ultimate
"I love you" to these guys.
When does the unsub start targeting Maeve?
Maeve said it started out of the blue.
My guess is it was some sort of accidental when she acted some-
something she probably wasn't even aware of.
That's gonna make the unsub hard to find.
And Maeve, too,
until we know more about her.
I found her.
There are a lot many geneticists with that name,
but Dr. Maeve Donovan took a sabbatical
from Mendel University 10 months ago.
That fits the timeline.
Oh, she's a smart cookie. She burned her credit history,
but her parents rent a little loft at the warehouse five days ago.
Did the parents sell their house recently?
No.
They might be helping her hide.
Morgan, you and JJ go to the loft.
Blake and Dave, go to the lab.
How clear is your head?
Not very clear--
I want to talk to her parents,
but I want you to observe the interview.
Reid.
I have a picture of her. Do you want to see what she looks like?
No.
So what are we, 10 miles outside of the city?
Her parents wanted to put some distance between her and her stalker,
but they may have just made her an easier target.
FBI.
Anybody home?
It's clear.
This is definitely a crime scene.
It must have been a hell of fight.
Smash...
Then hit.
There is no sign of forced entry.
Maeve was on high alert.
Exactly.
Then how did this unsub get her to let her guard down?
基因学院
Here you go.
That's the personnel files of everyone in the lab.
Not much there.
Only 5 docs work here besides her.
And they're all men.
Did any of them take a particular interest in her work?
We all did.
Her last project on cyclic adenosine monophosphate--
revolutionary stuff.
Quite frankly,
she made connections before I could even see them.
We know the feeling.
When was the last time that you spoke to Maeve?
6 days ago.
5, after we got her situated in the loft.
Why didn't she leave the DC area?
I have health issues.
Cancer.
And she wanted to stay close.
We were working on an oncology project together,
and it was easier to share data if she was nearby.
You're a geneticist, too?
Retired.
I got out when I heard there was a new Dr. Donovan in town.
I know this is difficult for both of you,
but is there anyone that you suspect?
Bobby.
The police ruled him out early on,
but we never liked him.
Who is Bobby?
Her fiance.
And there were issues?
Bobby was her first serious relationship.
It was only till after they got engaged
she realized...
he was a controlling bastard.
Sorry. But it's true.
Well, we need to talk to him.
Fiance?
Reid, slow down.
She had a fiance, Hotch.
Let us handle it.
Robert Putnam.
FBI.
Who?
We're looking for Robert Putnam.
Do you know where he is?
He's in the back.
We need to talk to him.
And who are you?
I'm Diane, his girlfriend.
Hey, sweetheart, who is it?
Robert Putnam, we'd like to...
I know you.
Out.
Wait, I need to talk to him, Hotch.
Why did he just recognize you?
A couple of weeks ago, Maeve and I were gonna meet.
He was at the restaurant.
I caught him looking at me
and something felt off about him.
And you're telling me this now?
I didn't know who he was
and then a friend of his sat down,
so I just assumed that I overreacted.
Reid, if he's the unsub,
you're a material witness.
You can't be in there. You know that.
Stay here.
Look, what's going on?
Where's Maeve?
We were hoping you knew.
Why would I know?
The same way that you knew that
she'd be at that restaurant two weeks ago.
Care to explain?
When she went into hiding, she broke off the engagement.
I needed to see her,
to make sure she was all right.
So I hired a private detective
and he found her through her parents.
When she made the reservation, I showed up, too.
Why did you bring a friend?
Because there was a psychopath after her, that's why.
For someone madly in love,
you sure moved on in a hurry.
Maeve told me to.
And apparently she took her own advice.
Did that make you mad?
Mad enough to hurt her?
Mad enough to stalk the man that she was meeting?
There's something over there on that table,
I'm gonna go get.
Don't shoot me.
He sent these to us.
The last month of our engagement.
The fact is,
I was being stalked, too.
Excuse me, doctor.
Agent Hotchner said you were down from upstairs,
Can, can you tell me what's going on?
We'll be in touch, ma'am.
Thank you.
All right, kid, talk to me.
I can tell you're adding something up in your head.
What is it?
2,412.
It's the number of hours we spent communicating,
counting phone calls and letters.
That's about 100 days.
100.5. What if that's all I get?
Well, it's not.
You can't say that.
Yes, I can.
Cause when we find her alive,
and you finally get to lay your eyes on her,
what's the first thing you're gonna say to her?
A couple of months ago we were getting off the phone
and she said,
"Bye. Love you."
Just like that.
"Bye. Love you."
I know it was just a slip, but--
But she said it, Reid.
She said it.
You didn't say it back to her, did you?
I was waiting for when we finally met.
Ok, I'm sharing something I haven't told anyone.
Every time we have a stalking case,
I think Rosanna Arquette.
The whole Arquette family to choose from
and you go with Rosanna.
Of course I go with Rosanna, because Rosanna Arquette
was the inspiration for two seminal songs of my childhood.
"Rosanna," by Toto...
Obviously.
...and "In your eyes" by Peter Gabriel,
which gives one pause to think of the myriad of ways
a man can be obsessed by a woman,
and what is she doing in bed
to inspire that kind of obsession, and can she teach us?
Because I want to know.
Whoa.
He want detona that one.
Jj, is that...
I don't get it. I mean, I see the message,
"I'm obliterating you,"
but we already knew that.
No, see, it's not about the message.
It's about the medium, what he used to draw on her face.
Spence...
It's black eyeliner.
Stalker's a woman.
That's why she masked her voice on the phone.
That's why Maeve let her in to her loft.
She thought what we thought,
that her stalker was a man.
But the question is, how could this unsub
have known about Maeve and you?
Hotch,
did you ever identify me to Bobby Putnam's girlfriend?
What?
Did you say my name to her?
Did you call me Dr. Reid or Agent Reid?
I never mentioned you at all. Why?
Excuse me, doctor.
I think I know who the unsub is.
Hey, honey.
You're still thinking about him, aren't you?
Yes.
Are you sure that he was the one at the restaurant?
Yes.
He's an FBI Agent.
Interesting.
I'm sorry.
I know I said I'd let this go.
It's OK, part of me want the answer
just as much as you do.
Is that new?
Do you like it?
I, um, I've never seen you dressed like that before.
No, you haven't, in fact.
I've been waiting for months for you to notice me,
notice that I'm better, sexier, smarter than her.
It's not until I debase myself, then you notice.
What are you talking about?
Do you like this, Bobby?
Because you have seen it before.
Is that...
Diane,
Where did you get Maeve's clothes?
From her closet.
Right after I bashed her head in.
She finally saw me,
just like you see me now.
Take a look, Bobby.
Take a good look.
What have we got?
Well, she knew we were close,
so she came back for the fiance.
Looks like they had a normal conversation,
then she got violent. Same thing that happened to Maeve.
Hey, dollface, what do you got?
An identity that's pure vapor.
Diane Huntington is a fake name.
So is her address.
And all the phone conversations
she had with Bobby were from a burner phone.
All right, keep digging and keep us posted.
We need to rethink the profile,
reset everything that we know about Maeve
through the prism of one woman stalking another.
You know...
I couldn't understand it, Bobby.
I really couldn't.
You could have had me.
Instead you wanted that.
Maeve?
I'm so sorry.
Why are you doing this?
Why?
Let's just say
she took something from me that I can't get back.
So I decided if I can't have my life,
I'm gonna take hers.
What is she talking about?
I don't know. I don't--I don't know who she is.
After hunting her for ten months,
after stealing her man,
I had to stop and say, what is so freakin' special about her?
I couldn't see it.
Until I saw... him.
Him who?
The night you followed her, I followed you.
And I saw him.
I want what they have.
I want him.
That's why you're doing this?
Because of that stupid FBI Agent?
That stupid FBI agent is the reason why you're still alive.
You're gonna get her to tell me about him.
I don't want to hear what she has to say.
But that wasn't a request.
Ok, we know numbers on female stalkers are minimal.
Only 10% of all cases are female.
All right, what tops the list of motivators?
Prior sexual intimacy.
Erotomania?
No. Go the other direction.
Think female scorned.
We slept together. You broke up with me.
Now I'll do anything to get back with you.
Reid, could that have fit Maeve?
Could she have possibly been in a relationship with this woman?
No. No.
Spence, this morning you didn't know that she was engaged.
Yeah, but the answer is no.
And what's the second-most common motivation?
Celebrity stalking.
That fits better.
Well, how? She's not famous.
Maeve's a star in her field, though.
That's a stretch.
Celebrity stalkers are usually nonviolent.
You want to tell that to John Lennon, Rossi?
What was it that Mark David Chapman said after he shot him?
"It was like all of my nobody-ness
and all of his somebody-ness collided."
Maeve is somebody,
and this bitch is nobody!
I'm sorry. I don't know where that came from.
Um, I can't be very helpful right now. I should leave.
Reid. Reid, yes, you can.
You have 100.5 days of communication with the girl
and your brain lets you recall every word verbatim.
She probably revealed details about the unsub to you
and neither of you even noticed.
There's too much of it
and I can't sort through it with any clarity.
And pick one of us, someone will go through with you.
Blake.
Ok.
Let's get out of here.
You wanna talk here?
Yep.
You play?
Yeah, I know my way around a board,
but... that's not the point.
I want you to focus here and not on my questions.
So, let's try this out.
When you think of Maeve,
what's the first thing that comes to mind?
Thomas Merton.
What about him?
In her letters,
she will always sign up with a quote
from one of her favorite philosophers.
Camus, Voltaire, Plato.
When we had the near miss at the restaurant a couple of weeks ago,
She left me a book
with a quote by Thomas Merton written inside.
He said "Love is our true destiny.
"We do not find the meaning of life by ourselves alone.
We find it with another."
Then...
Thomas Merton was her way of saying good-bye.
Yeah.
So,
let's talk about this. Hmm?
Because this I didn't expect.
Oh, I'm sorry. Let me catch you up.
I found these letters in Maeve's loft,
and I guess she didn't get around to sending this one,
and...it's really good.
"About the blindfold today,
I can't wait to use it."
Blindfold.
You know, I thought I knew your fiancee.
But I guess she's kinkier than we thought.
It's not what you think.
"It's not what you think" is girl code
for "It's exactly what you think."
No, it's not what you think.
Did you sleep with him?
I never even saw him.
Why risk your life to meet him?
I've been alone for so long, I just wanted to be with somebody.
You could have been with Bobby.
It was different with him.
Different how?
He was just...
He was just what, Maeve?
When we would talk, I would...
It was effortless?
That is so interesting.
Really.
So if you two had this deep connection
where you're talking in your own code,
why do you think the unsub would attack the fiance first?
I don't know, access, maybe.
No, something links the two of you in the unsub's mind.
She wants to destroy anyone
Maeve had a romantic relationship with?
It could be jealousy or revenge.
Maybe Maeve got in the way of one of her old relationships?
It's just not her.
You see, when men cheat,
It's below the belt.
But when women cheat,
It's above the neck.
No. We were broken up. I never cheated on you.
But you didn't love me.
Not like that.
Now you know how I felt,
to be ignored, cast aside.
It's not fun, is it?
Just let us go, D
What else do you want?
Did you guys ever compare lists?
The different people you dated?
I remembered 4th, 3:40 p.m.,
I asked her if she dated a lot growing up.
No way.
Do you know how many friday nights I had
where it was just me and a microscope?
I thought that was just me.
Oh, come on.
Girls must have adored you at high school.
I was 12, it's kind of confusing
once I got the note from this girl I had a crash on.
She thought I was cute
but would only meet me if I wore a blindfold.
I did. And she took my shirt off.
That's when I heard the laughter.
Most of the senior class was in there.
Oh, it sounds awful.
Maeve thought so, too.
When we finally meet,
I'm gonna make blindfolds fun again.
You had him eating out of the palm of your hand every Sunday
and he never even saw your face.
I have to admit that takes skill.
That takes finesse.
How'd you do it?
Hello!
Doctor, are you in there?
Seriously?
OK. Fine.
Just tell her.
There was a moment when you had him
and you knew you had him.
What was it?
Euclidean Geometry.
There's this thing called the Penrose Triangle.
He told me a story
about how he tried to build one when he was 8.
This better get sexy quick. I'm getting bored.
You can't build it.
It's an impossible physical structure.
It only exists in conceptual geometry.
But I said,
every Penrose Triangle has its thorns.
And he laughed.
It's just a stupid pun.
But he laughed.
That's it.
What about co-workers?
Maeve was the only female doctor at Mendel University.
What was it like for her?
She once spoke about the awkwardness
of being the only woman in the department.
When men are jealous of your success in the lab,
they want it for themselves.
But women want it so you can't have it.
Sometimes this institution turns us against each other.
What if the unsub wasn't a doctor.
What if she was a grad student
maybe working on her Ph.D. there.
Yeah, but how could Maeve miss her?
Each of the doctors has their own project.
Each project has it's own team of research assistants.
They don't mingle, but they'd be the first applicants
for an open position.
And if Maeve rejected her thesis,
the unsub would take it personally.
And that rejection has become an obsession to possess.
I want to see what he sees.
He sees you as his equal.
That's it, isn't it?
I just--I have to let him see that I'm on your level.
Great. You figured it out.
Now, please, will you let us go?
No.
No.
I have to show her that I can take everything that she has.
Then she's going to remember me.
You, however, are superfluous.
I'm sorry, Bobby.
You've always been the runner-up in this pageant.
Wait. Wait.
Please. Please...
Don't hurt him.
Please!
Don't hurt him.
Her name is Diane Turner.
She worked as a research assistant at Mendel University
while Maeve was there.
Did she apply a Ph.D. there?
Yeah. She was one of a bunch of internal applicants
that got rejected.
Looks like she left not long after Maeve.
Correct. She now works at a local junior college.
Dave, you, Reid, and JJ take the residence.
Blake and Morgan, take the campus.
What was her doctoral thesis about?
It says here, "Spontaneous Cellular Death in Suicide Patients."
There's a suicidal ideation again.
Except cells don't behave that way.
Why is she so obsessed with it?
You still don't remember who I am, do you?
No.
I've tried and tried to remember and I can't.
But whatever it is I did to you, I'm sorry.
Forgive me. Tell me what it is you want me to say to you
and I will say it.
I just want this to be over.
I can do that.
You just have to do something for me first.
Get up there.
Why?
Do it.
Why don't you just kill me?
I want to see if you'll jump.
It's my theory that when you make a decision to give up
that the cells in your body start to die.
Can you feel it?
Your whole body beginning to decay.
It makes it easier to want to kill yourself.
Go. Go ahead, prove my theory.
I remember you.
Clear!
Clear.
Is this a shrine to her dead parents?
Her parents committed suicide.
That explains her obsession.
Guys, she is watching us.
Garcia.
What you got, mama grizzly?
There's a web cam in here. Can you hack the feed?
I read your thesis, didn't I?
You turned me down because you couldn't handle the competition.
No. I turned you down because your testing was flawed.
It was not flawed!
Your sample was biased,
you included your parents.
The science was sound.
You didn't even read the whole thing, did you?
No, I did. I did.
I did read it.
And do you know what I thought after I was finished?
I thought, whoever wrote this has suffer a tragedy.
And I felt sorry for your loss.
But you don't get a Ph.D.
just because something bad happened to you.
No.
You just couldn't see it?
You can't see that I'm a genius!
Genius? Do you know what genius is?
I know that I am one.
Maybe.
Maybe you do have that gift.
Maybe your theory could have had merit.
But we don't know.
Because genius isn't just one good idea
or one successful experiment, Diane.
Genius is work.
Thousands of hours of work.
She's spoofing the IP address
and she's encrypted the feed.
In other words, like layman's terms, this is gonna take a while.
What are you doing?
Making a deal.
That's why you didn't make it.
You didn't do the work.
But you could.
Yeah, you could do the work.
I'll help you.
Get on the ledge.
Now!
No. If you're gonna kill me, you kill me.
But I am not jumping.
Because I want to live long enough to see Spencer arrest you.
Spencer has a different idea.
Hello.
It's me.
Are you ok?
She killed Bobby.
Are you ok?
Yeah.
I've got a concussion and some bruising, but I'm ok.
Can I talk to her?
No. She's listening.
Good.
But I want to meet her. I need to see her face to face.
She has a message she wants me to give you.
What is it?
The message is, she left you a present.
And if you want to find it, it's easy as pie.
What does that mean? I don't understand what that means.
Neither do I.
Spencer, it's a trap.
If you come here, she's gonna kill you!
I need a map of D.C.
This is Diane Turner's apartment.
This is the nearest cell tower her phone call to me pinged off of,
which means this is the circle that Maeve was telling me about.
What circle?
It was a clue in Diane's message.
Finding her would be as easy as pie.
Only she wasn't referring to the food,
she was referring to...
Pi.
Why would Diane give you a clue?
Maeve made a similar pun once.
Now Diane wants me to see her the same way,
but brilliant, the smartest girl in the room.
All right, assuming that Diane has a secondary location,
where in the circle would she hold Maeve?
She'd need a building that would allow for privacy and control,
a closed garage for prisoner transfer...
If she's copying Maeve's life,
it might be someplace close to Maeve's apartment.
There's nothing in Diane's name.
Well, what about Maeve's name, or even Bobby's?
Maybe she forged his signature.
Nope.
What about Diane's parents?
Yes. Yes. Diane rented a
loft right next to Maeve's in her parents' name.
Reid.
I can't let you be a part of this takedown.
We don't have a choice. If I don't go in there, Maeve is dead.
And if you do, you're dead.
Hotch, we've known from the beginning
she's on a murder-suicide mission,
but we never stopped to ask why she's on that mission.
We know now that it's because she wants recognition,
the type of recognition she thinks Maeve gets,
and I can give her that.
How?
I'm gonna tell her that I love her.
Hang on. I got a box on the steps.
That's the gift.
What is that, a blindfold?
Take your gun and vest off.
Now come in alone.
Reid.
Put it on.
Can I take the blindfold off?
No.
Hello.
I was hoping you'd figure out my riddle.
I mean, I knew you would.
The fun was just how fast you'd do it.
Oh, there's some brains, too.
It took me a long time.
To be honest, i was distracted by your thesis.
You read my thesis?
I did. You know, I think your writing
puts you on the same plane as Jonas Salk.
发现并制造出首例安全有效的脊髓灰质炎疫苗
I've already sent it to the NIH.
Flattery is not gonna get you out of this.
I know what's waiting for me outside.
I've arranged for your freedom.
The federal government doesn't make deals with people like me.
Not true. Nazi scientists were recruited for the Manhattan project.
Mafia bosses are regularly put into witness protection.
If what you have is valuable enough,
the federal government will work with you.
And what you have is very valuable.
And what do I have, doctor?
You have a brain that doesn't play by normal societal rules.
And I know that all your life
the people you care about the most keep leaving.
There's a part of you that thinks it's because of that brain.
Well, I'm here because I'm not going to leave you.
I'm here because...
I just... hope that I can get the chance.
Chance of what?
To be with you.
Me for her. That was the deal, right?
You're choosing me over her?
Diane, how could it be anyone else?
Prove it.
All right. How?
Say it again.
This time say it to her face.
I don't love you.
Sorry.
I understand.
I don't need her anymore.
Kill her and she won't have
to live with the fact that you're smarter.
Let her live with her arrogance and see them.
I just want her to see one more thing.
Liar.
Liar!
Shots fired!
Let's go!
Stay back! Stay back! Stay back!
Stay back, stay back!
Diane, Diane, there's still a way out of this.
You never wanted me.
Never!
You lied!
I didn't.
Diane, I offered you a deal and you can still take it.
Me for her. Let me take her place.
You would do that?
Yes.
You would kill yourself for her?
Yes.
Thomas Merton.
Who's Thomas Merton?
He knows.
He knows.
Who's Thomas Merton?
Who is he?
