who are you ?
who are you ?
oh , my god . that &apos;s my mother .
there are only two prison worlds in existence ,
mine and the one created in 1903
for locking up your mom
and her closet full of crazy pants .
tell me how to get her back !
your mom &apos;s a ripper !
meet the real sarah salvatore .
i &apos;m going to make her do things
she &apos;d never dream of doing
until she begs me to make her a vampire .
i &apos;m pregnant .
marry me .
yes .
my mom is dead ,
and i just need the pain to be gone .
if anyone tries to flip my humanity switch back on ,
i &apos;ll become your worst nightmare .
i like you .
stop .
come back .
what the hell are you doing with sarah ?
i &apos;m going to kill her .
if stefan wants to save sarah &apos;s life ,
all he has to do is shut his humanity off .
stefan , don &apos;t you dare shut it off .
just remember to bring me back .
a hard knock life , is it ?
don &apos;t walk there .
i just washed that .
my apologies , cinderella .
what are you doing ?
stefan and i had a moment .
things broke in the process ,
and now i &apos;m returning the scull bar to the way we found it .
uh , the whole point of flipping your humanity switch
is that you don &apos;t care how you leave things .
i go to school here , enzo .
i want to keep going to school here ,
and the second that i draw any suspicions--
break @-@ ins , broken property , dead bodies--
people will try to interrupt my routine .
then i will end up rotting in a cell somewhere
instead of i should be doing ,
which is preparing ror my audition tomorrow .
you , caroline forbes , vampire without humanity ,
auditioning for the school play ?
musical .
and obviously , duh .
i &apos;m a drama major .
and what are you doing here ?
find my phone led me here ,
though it didn &apos;t explain why your
sticky fingers needed it last night .
because you &apos;re the only one with sarah salvatore &apos;s phone number .
why &apos;d need sarah &apos;s number ?
to use her life as leverage to convince stefan
to shut his humanity switch off , too .
that &apos;s both clever and deeply unsettling .
tell me she &apos;s still alive .
she &apos;s alive ,
assuming she survived any infections
resulting from liam &apos;s amateur surgery .
which means stefan &apos;s humanity &apos;s a thing of the past .
like i said ,
i will stop at nothing to maintain my routine ,
so i suggest that you stay away .
now if you don &apos;t mind ,
i need to prepare my audition .
how was the rave ?
oh , you know , loud , lame ,
rave @-@ like .
anything i should know
or anything you &apos;d like to talk about
bro to bro ?
where do we keep our weapons ?
pardon ?
crossbows , vervain grenades ,
all that hunter crap jeremy was into ?
yes ! the throne .
elena told on me . shocker .
not a good time for a humanity flip , brother .
do yourself a favor .
stay out of my way today .
easy .
where am i ?
you &apos;re at whitmore medical center .
i &apos;m dr. laughlin .
last night ...
you had a little bit too much to drink .
a professor found you passed out on the quad .
i sort of remember that .
it was like a spring break kickoff rave .
i should get home .
actually , i need you to sit tight .
we need to look after you for a while .
you lost a lot of fluids last night .
ok ?
for the record ,
i am not ok with turning my hospital
into a supernatural holding cell .
ok . look . it &apos;s the first day of spring break .
the campus is like a ghost town .
besides , we need to keep her out of harm &apos;s way
until elena &apos;s blood is out of her system
unless of course you want to invite
another salvatore vampire to our wedding .
i &apos;m starting to think that eloping is the way to go .
yeah . yeah . me , too .
look . she &apos;s being compelled to forget last night ,
and soon , she &apos;ll be back at duke ,
safe with no idea what happened
and no one the wiser .
duke .
that &apos;s not bad .
it &apos;s a little obnoxious
but kind of in a cute way , you know ?
little duke .
wait .
we &apos;re thinking baby names ?
you haven &apos;t been ?
no .
i have ! no . i have . i totally have .
name one .
josette jr .
get out of here .
i have rounds .
ok .
damon .
what are you doing ?
looking for a ...
healthy outlet for my rage .
i haven &apos;t found it yet .
stefan without his humanity is one artery away
from stefan the ripper ,
and every day that goes by
is one year of guilt waiting for him on the other side .
yeah . well ,
not to add to our growing pile of bad news ,
but we didn &apos;t just lose stefan .
we lost our chance to spark caroline &apos;s humanity .
turns out he was her emotional trigger .
no , thanks .
well , take it away from me
because i &apos;m seconds away from using it on this .
yeah .
who is that ?
this ...
is lillian salvatore .
your mother is alive ?
yep . turns out she &apos;s been
in a prison world snapshot of 1903 for over a century .
your mother is alive .
oh , yeah . alive and well ,
not in the pine box that i thought i buried her in in 1858,
and apparently , she &apos;s a vampire
and not just any kind of vampire either--
damon , your mother is alive !
she &apos;s a ripper , elena .
makes perfect sense .
stefan was always such a mama &apos;s boy .
how much of a mama &apos;s boy ?
he would have hanged himself
with mother &apos;s apron strings
if it meant her approval .
we both would . we loved her .
she was our world .
what ?
no . no way .
this is our way to get stefan back !
you can &apos;t tell me that his mother isn &apos;t an emotional trigger .
elena , this woman killed so many people
that an entire coven of witches
built her a permanent timeout !
you don &apos;t fix one ripper problem
by unleashing another ripper .
think about it . if this works ,
we don &apos;t just get stefan and caroline back .
we get your mother back .
aren &apos;t you even a little curious to see her ?
i might know a few witches that could help .
i &apos;m not helping you .
i hate kai , and you know that ,
and the first thing you did when i got back
was throw him in my face to fake apologize .
yeah , and then i real apologized for being a dick .
and here you are less than 24 hours later asking me
to work with him .
bonnie , we need kai to get to 1903,
and we need bennett blood to do the damn spell .
listen . we go in , we grab my mom ,
she flips stefan &apos;s switch ,
he triggers caroline , emotional dominoes .
everybody wins .
if i give you my blood ,
will you just get out of my face ?
probably ,
although ...
i think you &apos;re gonna want to join us .
stick with me , bonnie bennett .
i might just have the answer to all your prayers .
you want the 1903 ascendant .
well , sure . just let me reach in my pocket and pull it out .
if you &apos;re sincerely looking for a way
to make up for the hell that you put me through ,
this is it .
ok . the problem is the gemini kept the existence
of the 1903 prison world a secret for generatiras ,
so find the key to that particular jail cell ,
i &apos;d have to navigate ancient texts ,
undo layers of magical cloaking spells , and ...
wait .
oh , that &apos;s weird .
it was in my pocket .
when damon told me about mama salvatore , i started looking ,
and if i wanted to ,
i could get her out .
newly minted leader of the gemini coven and all ,
i don &apos;t even need a celestial event to zap us there .
ok . so what &apos;s the catch ?
i &apos;ll go if you go .
come on . it could be fun ,
you know , 1903 , the--the gilded age .
didn &apos;t you ever dream about time travel ?
i would rather die of cholera
than spend an afternoon with you .
you &apos;re way more likely to die at the hands of your gal pal caroline .
i bet it will be over something stupid
like she stops doing laundry ,
and you make some snippy comment ,
and she snips off your tongue .
i &apos;m mean ,
if only there were some way to reunite her
with her humanity .
hello ? pretty sure i crushed that .
moving , truly ,
although it did lack a certain , um ,
authenticity .
what the hell are you doing ?
that was the director !
and you are a vampire without humanity ,
singing about heartbreak .
it &apos;s a performance , stefan .
it sure is , caroline , especially
this carefully crafted good student routine ,
straight and narrow ,
anything to keep you from making a mistake
you might regret one year from now
when you flip your switch back on .
oh , except the whole ruining my life part .
well , if your humanity &apos;s off ,
then you shouldn &apos;t really care how i deal .
no , no , no . see , that &apos;s where you &apos;re wrong
because like you , i &apos;m prone to doing
bad things when my humanity is off ,
but unlike you , i don &apos;t have
an elaborate system to keep me in check .
well , that &apos;s not my problem .
well , i &apos;m making it your problem .
if my life is gonna fall apart
when my humanity starts flooding back ,
then so is yours .
when i &apos;m done with you ,
you &apos;ll be drowning in mistakes .
this is seriously about revenge ?
yes , it is ,
and this ,
this is a control freak &apos;s worst nightmare .
this is me undoing your routine .
this is me ...
forcing you to let go
one day at a time
until you break .
damn .
crocodile dundee called . he wants his knife back .
yeah . you know , he &apos;s no longer a thing ,
and neither is that joke .
is this presentable attire by 1903 standards ?
who said you &apos;re coming ?
to meet the woman who gave birth
to the two epic loves of my life ?
me .
powerful as i am , there &apos;s a limit
to how many people one witch can transport with this spell .
right . which is why there &apos;s two of us .
shall we ?
fine . let &apos;s go get mama .
sangiema meam
et nos mundo carcerema .
sangiema meam
et nos mundo carcerema .
well , isn &apos;t this a picturesque slice of hell ?
you guys go ahead .
kai and i will start the locator spell on the ascendant .
but kai just had the ascendant .
why do we have to find another one ?
the ascendant can &apos;t travel between worlds ,
which means we got to find its mirror image here in 1903 .
page 10 of the world @-@ jumping rulebook .
shall we ?
i don &apos;t want to leave you alone with him .
i &apos;ll be fine .
he &apos;s good now , remember ?
new leaf .
new leaf ?
you believe me .
hell , no .
but , damon and elena need to meet his mom alone .
so shut up , and let &apos;s find the ascendant .
oh , shoot .
is your bike ok ?
do you need money for the bus ?
seriously ?
i just had to stuff the director &apos;s body into a furnace .
do you know how hard it was to get an audition
during spring break ?
oh , come on . it was easy for you , caroline .
all you had to do was shed some tears about your mom &apos;s funeral ,
play the cancer card ,
and--boom--your precious routine is back on track .
am i wrong ?
this is your only warning .
go away .
neat , organized caroline ,
staying within the lines .
good at control , terrible at revenge .
i dismantled your bike .
i tore your director &apos;s head off with my teeth .
oh , my god . caroline , did you literally
just unbolt this damn thing ?
i mean , it &apos;s gonna take me , what , 10 minutes
to put this back together ?
you are an embarrassment to humanity @-@ free vampires everywhere .
ok . so i &apos;ve got a few . you ready ?
actually , i thought about it ,
and anyone named alaric should not be allowed
to name another human .
uh , i didn &apos;t name me .
true . ok . you can have veto power .
good . well , then i veto duke .
uh , let me call you right back .
what are you doing here ?
really hoping you &apos;ve got enough vervain
to get blondie and her cohort
from here to the salvatore cellar
without further drama .
you do realize i &apos;m a human , right ,
up against two vampires without remorse ?
i see .
your girl has got a bun in the oven ,
and now you &apos;ve gone all gun @-@ shy .
vamp hearing .
you know , i &apos;d actually like my child to grow up with a father .
granted , a cowardly father .
probably play catch and run from the ball
or go fishing and flee from the fish .
i have weapons in my apartment .
can we just take a second to acknowledge
how insane it is that we &apos;re
standing in the house that you grew up in ?
damon , you were so adorable .
oh , thanks .
except that &apos;s stefan .
this ...
is me .
we &apos;re not here to socialize .
we get the ascendant ,
we find my mother .
after she flips stefan &apos;s switch ,
i &apos;ll figure out what the hell we &apos;re gonna do with her .
you can give her another chance .
chance to what ,
eviscerate another literal boatload of people ?
stefan was a ripper .
you never gave up on him .
and where was lily from 1858 @-@ 1903 ?
she was blood @-@ binging through europe
while stefan and i carried the loss .
not exactly maternal , elena .
as far as i &apos;m concerned , my mother died
when we buried her empty coffin .
the woman we &apos;re looking for is just a tool to get my brother back .
damon ?
hello , mother .
there was a time i marked days on a calendar .
i gave up after a few years ,
but judging by your bizarre attire--
you &apos;ve been in here for over a century .
yeah . i would have come by sooner ,
but i thought you were safe and sound in the family crypt .
my bad .
well , technically , i did die in 1858
after a nurse in the tb ward fed me vampire blood .
and you never thought to stop by and clear things up ?
how did you end up here ...
mrs. salvatore ?
&quot; mrs. salvatore &quot; ?
i don &apos;t know what to call her .
please call me lily .
it was october 31 , 1903 .
i had just arrived in new york harbor .
the night sky was alive with this beautiful , shimmering light ,
and out of nowhere , a coven of witches attacked ,
and when i awoke , they were gone .
everyone was gone .
that night , the sky danced with colors again ,
and it &apos;s done so every night since .
it &apos;s called prison . you must have pissed off a lot of people .
that life seems like forever ago .
you on a diet ?
i depleted every slaughterhouse within walking distance
and every butcher shop along the hellish trek from new york
to mystic falls .
this is the last of the blood here .
two drops a week just to stay awake .
that sounds miserable .
i manage .
i heard you and your brother turned during the war .
your father must have been horrified .
he was ,
and then stefan ripped his throat out .
i apologize . that &apos;s cruel to laugh ,
but good for stefan .
i truly hated that man .
oh , i know you did ,
so much so that you left your kids with him ,
faked your own death , and went out to join the ripper coalition .
well , it &apos;s nice to see that you &apos;ve grown into yourself , damon .
how &apos;s your brother ?
hello ?
is anyone there ?
damn it , stefan ! what do you want ?
oh , i brought you a little peace offering .
i figure with all that singing and furnace stuffing
you must be parched .
see , now this is how a vampire with no humanity
is supposed to act .
no .
i &apos;m inflicting actual pain .
leave me alone .
why ? are you thinking about giving in ,
letting go , breaking code ?
stefan , stop .
come on , caroline .
just let go .
i promise it will feel good .
i &apos;m not gonna let you ruin my life .
ok . then i &apos;ll end it .
you have really nice palms .
phesmatos tribum nas ex viras
sequitas sanguinem .
phesmatos tribum nas ex viras sequitas sanguinem .
do you know why i &apos;m here ?
phesmatos tribum nas ex viras ...
because my guilt keeps me up at night .
phesmatos tribum nas ex viras ...
sequitas sanguinem .
i don &apos;t--i don &apos;t expect you to believe me ,
but i need you to give me one more chance .
nas ex viras sequitas sanguinem .
phesmatos tribum nas ex viras ...
sequitas--
bonnie ! listen to me !
sorry . i-- oh , my god .
i didn &apos;t--i didn &apos;t mean to do that .
but you did it anyway
because even if you &apos;re telling the truth ,
the old you is still inside of you .
the ascendant is this way .
and you believe that i can reconnect stefan with his humanity ?
the last memory stefan has of you
is a vision of an angel telling him
that everything &apos;s gonna be ok .
so you &apos;re gonna be an angel again .
he doesn &apos;t need to know how screwed up you really are .
of course i &apos;ll help .
i &apos;d love nothing more than to see him again .
pack your bags .
wonderful . ha .
i &apos;ll alert the others .
you &apos;ll alert who now ?
you knew so much about me ,
i assumed you &apos;d heard of my traveling companions .
what traveling companions ?
everyone ...
meet my son damon .
he &apos;s here to take us home .
there you are .
definite role model material .
damon really spent 5 years in a cell with you
without killing himself ?
a fellow smartass .
i can see why you &apos;re his drinking buddy ,
though you &apos;re gonna have to knock off the hard stuff
while you &apos;re breastfeeding , mate .
you know , what are you even doing here ?
i thought you hated stefan .
yeah , i do .
in fact , i have a whole elaborate revenge scheme against him ,
but , well , unfortunately
in order to truly hurt someone , they have to care .
so you want stefan &apos;s humanity back
just to remind him how much you two hate each other ?
games are more fun with two players .
you know , last night , an innocent girl
had an involuntary splenectomy
because you brought her into your life .
now if that is your idea of fun ,
you need to take a long look in the mirror , pal .
and what , reevaluate my flipping disregard for human life ?
no . just confront your deep , obvious loneliness .
got me there .
yeah . i &apos;m just a sad nobody up to no good
while you &apos;re at home , ticking off your life milestones--
girl , kid , death .
sounds lovely .
what are you doing ?
what are you doing ?
it &apos;s called spring break .
it &apos;s called practice .
is he ok ?
he &apos;s fine .
nice going , you jackass .
second lesson in losing control--
no saving strangers .
go hide in your room .
i &apos;ll deal with you later .
so to summarize ...
letting go means being an idiot ,
increasing your chances of getting caught ,
and worst of all-- actively making choices--
uh , enzo .
bollocks .
these vampires have been trapped here with you the whole time ?
we went everywhere together .
they happened to be on the boat that night , poor souls .
these poor souls don &apos;t happen to have
the same affinity for rolling heads , do they ?
on the contrary .
these people saved me from that part of myself .
i was banished here because i was a monster .
i drank with no remorse from whatever human
i could sink my teeth into ,
but locked in this cage ,
i was forced to confront the animal that i had become ,
and as we ran out of resources ,
ay friends sacrificed their rations for me ,
and i knew if i drank everything ,
as every bone in my body demanded ,
there wouldn &apos;t be enough to wake them ,
so i learned to control my bloodlust
for them .
these people made me feel human again .
i &apos;ll fetch the last of the blood so we can revive them .
not only is she a ripper ,
she &apos;s an insane ripper !
or maybe she feels responsible for them .
what , are you kidding me ?
she has a vampire dollhouse .
damon ...
isn &apos;t this the ascendant ?
yeah .
why isn &apos;t bonnie here ?
because bonnie &apos;s not looking for the ascendant , elena .
spell feels stronger .
the ascendant must be around here somewhere .
why would the ascendant be here ?
i don &apos;t know . i didn &apos;t put it here .
if you don &apos;t think i &apos;m capable of change ,
why spend an entire day with me
by bringing me out into the middle of nowhere ?
i could gut you all over again .
your friends would never even hear you scream .
because maybe you &apos;re right .
maybe deep down , there &apos;s a part of me
that believes there &apos;s a sliver of good in you .
and you &apos;d be right .
looking , looking , and nope !
they didn &apos;t hide the ascendant in a random pile of--
bonnie !
what are you doing ?
gaining your trust and stabbing you in the back .
feels pretty sucky , doesn &apos;t it ?
bonnie , please don &apos;t .
don &apos;t what ? don &apos;t leave you here all alone ,
drive you to the point of wanting to end your own life ?
i almost killed myself because of you !
please . believe me .
i &apos;ve changed .
i know .
so have i.
at least they &apos;re still breathing .
damon must be up to something good
if he sent the &quot; b &quot; team .
what do you say we send him
a little message ?
what are you doing ?
stopping you from leaving the cleaning staff
two dead bodies ,
not to mention killing elena &apos;s former guardian
and your brother &apos;s best friend .
did you like being locked up and tortured
to get your humanity back ?
it must be so exhausting overthinking everything ,
denying your own urge to kill
and just be done with them .
back away .
fine . if that &apos;s what you want .
where are you going ?
you think i don &apos;t know everything about you ?
i taught you how to control your bloodlust , remember ?
stand still and don &apos;t scream .
what are you doing ?
the thing that you keep resisting .
if you &apos;re trying to tempt me ,
it &apos;s not working .
i don &apos;t have to try .
deep down , you and i are exactly the same , caroline .
come on . you can break routine for a second , right ?
she has a really pretty neck .
your vampire menagerie &apos;s gonna have to take the next train out .
we &apos;re down a witch .
you want to leave them behind ?
no , damon . you-- you can &apos;t save me without saving them .
we &apos;ll come back for them , promise .
let &apos;s go .
damon , look outside .
is that the aurora borealis ?
also known as our ticket out of here .
you got it ?
yeah .
ok .
you got to be kidding me .
go . start the damn spell .
i &apos;ll go get her .
time to wake up .
no !
i said they &apos;re not coming .
what have you done ?
we &apos;ll see them at the reunion . let &apos;s go .
you don &apos;t understand , damon .
i will not leave them .
too bad .
they are my family .
these people are my family .
these freaks may be your family ,
but stefan salvatore is mine ,
and if you don &apos;t want to help him ,
i will leave you here to rot .
do you understand me ?
sangiema meam liber nos ex carcerema .
sangiema meam liber nos ex carcerema .
sangiema meam liber ...
damon !
sangiema meam liber nos ex carcerema .
sangiema meam liber nos ex carcerema .
sangiema meam liber nos ex carcerema .
bonnie !
nice negligee .
enzo , hey .
um , did i call you last night ?
i have a text from you to meet up ,
but i don &apos;t remember ever seeing you .
look , sarah .
it was a mistake bringing you into my life .
then why did you ?
call it deep and obvious loneliness .
look . the truth is you &apos;ve been a pawn in a game
that i &apos;ve now lost interest in playing .
you &apos;re no ordinary girl , sarah salvatore .
you deserve better .
sarah salvatore ?
why would you call me that ?
oh , boy .
this is bad .
what ?
i &apos;m marrying an idiot .
you could have died today .
as opposed to any other day ?
18 years , that &apos;s how long i need you to be alive .
help me raise this baby .
then we can set him or her free into the world ,
and you can run around with guns and vampires and be an idiot .
ok ?
fine .
whole world runs on those things .
sooner you learn them , the better .
maybe you could teach me .
that &apos;s more stefan &apos;s thing .
maybe he can give you a tutorial after you mother him back to sanity .
stefan was right .
the night of my funeral ,
an angel did visit him--me .
i had just turned , and ...
i wanted to see my boys ...
but when i leaned down to whisper into stefan &apos;s ear ,
the hunger surged .
all i could hear was the pulse in his veins ,
all i could smell was the blood .
so i fled
for you sake .
and no matter how deeply you felt my absence ,
it is half as deep as i felt yours .
good to know .
i &apos;ll let you get some sleep .
damon .
yes ?
as much as i am looking forward to us
getting to know each other again ,
i fear that i--i can &apos;t truly be myself
until we &apos;ve retrieved the ones that i left behind .
when will we be going back ?
soon , but don &apos;t worry .
your prison world &apos;s not going anywhere .
where do they keep the food ?
oh , crap .
who the hell are--
should probably check the inventory
of the blood cooler before lily wakes up .
you have her eyes .
you brought that back ?
it &apos;s the only baby picture of my boyfriend in existence .
of course , i brought it back .
give me that .
i liked seeing that side of you today .
disappointed and disillusioned ?
you see that every day .
a mother &apos;s son .
she &apos;s just a means to get stefan back .
look . i know that she &apos;s not the woman that you remember ,
but give her some time .
you &apos;re lucky you &apos;re so adorable
because your eternal optimism is super annoying .
well , and i happen to know from experience
that it &apos;s never a waste of time
to look for the good in someone .
this woman left her kids
to go be a den mother to a family of vampires .
i think we &apos;re gonna be looking for quite a while .
well , then it &apos;s a good thing we have forever .
that wasn &apos;t terrible .
see ? control is overrated .
i don &apos;t even remember how we got back to my room .
where &apos;s my shirt ?
it &apos;s near the girl we left bleeding out in the hallway .
you were right .
your way is much more fun .
oh , hey , bon @-@ bon .
sorry .
awkward timing .
no , no , no . it &apos;s fine . i , um--
i have to actually go check in on ric
to find out how things are going with stefan and caroline , so ...
this better be good .
i just wanted to thank you
for helping me find closure today .
you know there &apos;s a crazy lady up there
that wants to open that prison world up more than anything , right ?
but we &apos;re never going back there , right ?
no , we &apos;re not .
good .
because i have something for you ,
a gift from 1994 .
i was gonna give it to you yesterday ,
but then you acted like an ass ,
and you didn &apos;t deserve it .
well , i ...
that &apos;s not what i think it is , is it ?
if it wasn &apos;t for your notes on the map of nova scotia ,
i would have never remembered there was magic on that island ,
and there &apos;s a good chance that i wouldn &apos;t be here today .
so for my &apos; 94 road trip ,
i got you a little something .
the cure .
the cure to vampirism .
i knew you were planning on getting it yourself .
you had the whole route mapped down to the kilometer .
why are you giving me this ?
because my mom &apos;s surprisingly happy as a vampire ,
and because i have full faith that we &apos;ll get caroline back
to normal the old @-@ fashioned way ,
but mostly because i knew you wanted it for elena .
what if i don &apos;t want it for her now ?
that &apos;s none of my business .
i &apos;m just finishing what you started .
you can give it to her or not .
it &apos;s up to you .
