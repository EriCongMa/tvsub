gentlemen , i think i &apos;ve come up with a fun way
to get young people interested in science .
physics mad @-@ libs .
其他人或自己可以随机说出一些固定词性的单词
now , give me a number .
five .
and an irrational constant .
&quot; e. &quot;
and a funny greek letter .
gamma .
i said funny .
upsilon ?
good one .
and an electrical charge .
positive .
perfect .
okay . get this .
&quot; professor jones told the symposium
he had a new method for calculating the mass of a muon .
five times the limit of &apos; e &apos; to the upsilon as ... &quot;
okay . no , no .
i &apos;ll start over .
&quot; professor ... &quot;
i haven &apos;t seen him laugh that hard
since the day leonard made that multiplication error .
oh , oh , lord , that multiplication error !
he thought he carried the one .
but he didn &apos;t .
it &apos;s not funny .
that mistake got published .
stop ! i &apos;m going to wet myself !
hey , guys , guys , president siebert is headed this way .
i wonder what he wants .
doesn &apos;t look happy ,
so i &apos;m guessing he wants to talk to sheldon .
dr. cooper ?
told ya .
oh , president siebert ,
i assume you &apos;d like to respond to one of the suggestions
i put in the box by your office .
no , and stop installing suggestion boxes everywhere .
you don &apos;t like written suggestions .
you don &apos;t like when i give them to you
while we &apos;re urinating in the men &apos;s room .
if i didn &apos;t know you any better , i &apos;d say that you &apos;re one of those
stubborn people who are not open to suggestions .
dr. cooper , the physics department chair tells me
you &apos;re refusing to take your vacation .
i don &apos;t need a vacation .
you &apos;re obligated to take one .
and i &apos;d also like you to know the most @-@ often received
suggestion in my suggestion box you installed without asking me
is &quot; can dr. cooper take a vacation ? &quot;
okay , settled , then . i &apos;ll see y &apos;all of you monday ,
except for you .
but if i don &apos;t come into work ,
what am i supposed to do with myself ?
read , rest , travel .
i hear afghanistan is nice this time of year .
sarcasm ?
no . you should go .
* that tonight &apos;s gonna be a good night *
* and tonight &apos;s gonna be a good night *
* and tonight &apos;s gonna be a good , good night *
* tonight &apos;s the night , uh , uh *
* let &apos;s live it up , uh *
* i got my money , let &apos;s spend it up ... *
good lord !
would you stop that caterwauling !
what the hell are you doing ? !
bleeding from my ears .
what are you doing hiding back there ?
i &apos;m sneaking into work .
now , if the guard at the university asks
what &apos;s under the blanket ,
you tell him it &apos;s some lobster traps .
lobster traps ?
yes .
that &apos;s how velma and scooby
smuggled shaggy into the old lighthouse .
what are you going to do when you get to the university ?
people are going to recognize you .
will they , leonard ?
fine . just get back under your blanket ,
and i &apos;ll drive you there .
and no more singing .
fine .
&lt; i &gt; i have gps on my phone . &lt; / i &gt;
i know you turned around .
i &apos;m so glad you talked howard
out of having your wedding invitations in klingon .
turn it over .
i &apos;m hoping my relatives think it &apos;s hebrew .
this is really happening .
i &apos;m gonna be a maid of honor .
i &apos;m gonna wear a beautiful dress and walk down that aisle
and , finally , i will have my special day .
you mean my special day ?
they &apos;re gonna need an extra @-@ large veil for somebody &apos;s head .
if i ever actually ever get married .
why wouldn &apos;t you ?
my dad ...
&apos;cause i make a lot more money than howie ,
he &apos;s putting a lot of pressure on me to get a prenup .
ouch .
yeah . howie &apos;s gonna freak out .
parental pressure can be daunting .
i remember the battle with my mother about shaving my legs .
last year , i finally gave in and let her do it .
i just don &apos;t know how i &apos;m gonna break it to him .
you know , i &apos;m a big believer in breaking bad news
to a guy when you &apos;re in bed with him .
that &apos;s how i told my high school boyfriend
i slept with his brother .
that &apos;s how i told his brother the same thing .
i don &apos;t know , i don &apos;t want to manipulate him with sex .
oh , sweetie , that &apos;s what sex is for .
you know , the connection between marriage and money is nothing new .
in fact , the term &quot; wed &quot; referred to the money and livestock
that the groom paid the bride &apos;s father .
for example ,
you &apos;re adorable ,
intelligent and a good earner .
i could conservatively see you going for
at least two oxen and a goose .
you would fetch a unicorn .
sheldon , there are a million great vacations you could take .
what about hawaii ?
hawaii is a former leper colony on top of an active volcano
where the disappointing ending to &lt; i &gt; lost &lt; / i &gt; was filmed .
mahalo for nothing , hawaii .
how about florida ?
they got cape canaveral ,
they got disney , they got my aunt ida
and the world &apos;s largest collection of diabetic candy .
plus , if you get sweaty enough ,
her plastic @-@ covered furniture is like a flume ride .
my family took a trip to florida when i was a child .
a seagull stole a hot dog from me on the beach .
i got the message .
you know , if i had a week off , i &apos;d go back
to the two bunch palms resort and spa in the desert .
i tell you , an hour on the massage table with trevor ,
and you &apos;ll feel like you were born without bones .
i don &apos;t think i could ever let a guy give me a massage .
really ? what was i doing to your neck last night
while you were playing x @-@ box ?
it &apos;s like i &apos;m living in a dictatorship .
&quot; you must take a vacation , you must have fun ,
you must enjoy life . &quot;
i don &apos;t think you have a good handle on dictatorships .
sheldon , everybody takes vacations .
one time they tried to make richard feynman take a vacation ,
but he chose instead to expand his mind
and learn something new .
he went to work in his friend &apos;s biology lab .
richard feynman was a famous american physicist ,
part of the manhattan project .
盎格鲁国家秘密研发原子弹项目的代号
everyone in the world of science knows who richard feynman was .
now you do , too .
oh ! i have a brilliant idea .
amy &apos;s a biologist . i &apos;ll go work in her lab .
isn &apos;t that just feynman &apos;s idea ?
ten seconds ago , you never heard of him .
now you &apos;re an expert .
hey , you .
is that your laundry ?
you only have , like , six things in there .
yeah , i didn &apos;t have any quarters ,
so i &apos;ve been sneaking stuff into other people &apos;s loads all day .
hey , if i tell you something ,
will you promise not to tell anybody ?
it doesn &apos;t matter what i say , you &apos;re gonna tell me anyway .
what ? that is not true .
bernadette wants a prenup .
wow . that &apos;s rough .
so you &apos;re saying if i became a famous movie star ,
we got married , you wouldn &apos;t sign a prenup ?
absolutely not .
if i &apos;m gonna be stuck at home with the kids
while you &apos;re on location
cheating on me with ryan gosling ...
then leonard gots to get paid .
so , you think about us getting married ?
i think about a lot of things .
i think about us getting married ,
i think about us breaking up .
once in a while , i think about
how i didn &apos;t leave a note on that mercedes
i dinged in the parking lot last month ,
but then i have a glass of wine and it passes .
joke all you want , but you think about it .
well , tell you one thing ,
if i ever do get married , no klingon invitations .
good luck catching a man with that attitude .
boy , oh , boy !
this vacation is off to a wonderful start .
the smell of formaldehyde ...
the whir of the centrifuge ,
the distant chatter of lab animals
being dispatched for dissection .
mm , i can already feel my cares just melting away .
i &apos;m excited to work with my boyfriend .
it &apos;s gonna be romantic .
way to kill the mood .
come on , sheldon .
we can be like marie curie and her husband , pierre ,
who spent their days working side by side ,
bathed in the glow of their love and the radium
that ultimately killed her .
screw &lt; i &gt; beauty and the beast ; &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; that &apos;s &lt; / i &gt; the love story disney should tell .
okay , what do we start with ?
maybe splicing some genes , clone a sheep ,
perhaps grow a human ear on a mouse &apos;s back ?
ha @-@ ha , i &apos;m a freak !
oh , i &apos;m gonna be doing some brain stem histology
while you put yourself on the business end
of a sponge and wash those beakers .
wash those bea ...
oh , i get it , a little hazing for the new fella .
yeah , i &apos;d better keep an eye out for , what ,
shoe polish on the microscope ,
or mad cow disease in my grilled cheese sandwich ?
no , i just need those beakers washed .
hippity @-@ hop , quick like a bunny .
wha ... ? excuse me , you have dr. sheldon cooper in your lab .
you &apos;re gonna make him do the dishes ?
that &apos;s like asking the incredible hulk
to open a pickle jar .
sheldon , you &apos;ve never worked in a lab like this before .
you have no experience in the field of biology .
i have plenty of experience in biology .
i bought a tamagotchi in 1998 .
and ...
it &apos;s still alive .
let &apos;s do this .
where &apos;s howard ?
no &quot; hi , raj &quot; ?
no &quot; how are you , raj ? &quot;
just straight to &quot; where &apos;s the other white guy ? &quot;
i &apos;m sorry .
so , listen , i heard something about him .
can you keep it between us ?
ooh , gossip .
when i first got here , i thought you americans
really gossiped around the water cooler .
so i hung out there for , like , a month ,
but the only gossip i ever heard was about some creepy guy
hanging out by the water cooler .
bernadette wants to get a prenup .
oh , that &apos;s a shame-- he &apos;s gonna be devastated .
i never know what to do in these situations .
should i give him a heads @-@ up ?
hmm . i &apos;m gonna give you the same advice
i yell at the tv when the bachelor &apos;s handing out roses .
follow your heart .
check it out .
look at the size of that rice krispie treat !
same price .
hey , howard , i need to tell you something .
i know , it &apos;s not on my wedding diet .
i don &apos;t care .
uh , l @-@ listen , i ...
heard that bernadette &apos;s thinking about asking you for a prenup .
a prenup ?
what are you gonna do ?
i ... don &apos;t know .
follow your heart .
you know what , it &apos;s ... not a big deal .
she makes more money than me .
she wants to protect her financial interests .
it &apos;s completely reasonable .
good . that &apos;s a healthy attitude .
yeah , actually , it &apos;s good for both of us .
i have assets to protect , too .
like what ?
i &apos;ve got some rare comic books .
the vespa &apos;s almost paid off .
and ma and i have a primo double cemetery plot at mt . sinai
right near the guy who played mr. roper on &lt; i &gt; three &apos;s company . &lt; / i &gt;
mr. roper &apos;s dead ? !
you can &apos;t just spring that on a guy !
here you go .
this is now the only lab
with glassware washed by a man with two doctorates
and a restraining order signed by carl sagan .
soap spots . wash &apos; em again .
y ... you &apos;re being ridiculous !
those are perfectly clean .
sheldon , this beaker used to contain cerebral spinal fluid
from an elephant that died of syphilis .
if it &apos;s , in fact , perfectly clean ,
drink from it .
biologists are mean .
all right , perhaps this task will be a little bit more up your alley .
i need you to count the bacteria spores on these petri dishes .
there was something wrong with that detergent .
that was way too bubbly .
i &apos;m sure it was .
i intend to write
that soap company a strongly worded letter .
yeah , good for you . now , start counting .
you know what this place needs ?
a suggestion box .
366 ...
367 ...
how &apos;s it going ?
how &apos;s &lt; i &gt; counting &lt; / i &gt; going ?
when i was in kindergarten ,
i recited pi to a thousand places for the school talent show .
i think i got this .
great .
aw , nuts !
one ...
this is preposterous !
i think you &apos;re giving me these tasks
because you &apos;re afraid if you give me anything meaningful to do ,
i &apos;ll show you up .
really ? is that what you think ?
yes , that &apos;s what i think .
and i &apos;m super smart , so it &apos;s probably true .
hey , i &apos;ve been training in the field of neurobiology for 12 years .
you &apos;ve been here for three hours ,
and you &apos;ve spent one of them in the bathroom .
i &apos;m sorry ! it takes me a while
to get things going on an unfamiliar toilet .
sheldon , i &apos;ve given you the simplest things to do ,
and you haven &apos;t done one of them right .
maybe that &apos;s because i &apos;m not being challenged .
it &apos;s the same reason einstein failed math .
maybe the math was too bubbly for him .
you think you &apos;re doing science by cutting up that brain ?
they could do the same thing at any quiznos .
and they &apos;d offer to toast it for me , too .
okay , smart guy .
i &apos;m about to remove the locus coeruleus ,
which is incredibly delicate work .
have at it .
all right .
i &apos;m no stranger to a little gray matter .
locus coeruleus .
locus coeruleus .
you &apos;re getting warmer-- it is , indeed , in the brain .
hope your hands are steady .
it &apos;s the width of a single hair .
but this is just biology ,
so i &apos;m sure it &apos;s no problem for a genius like you .
it &apos;s not . i &apos;ll have you know , in the field of physics ,
we work with particles so small ,
they make fat jokes about the locus coeruleus .
i.e. , when your locus coeruleus sits around the house ,
it sits &lt; i &gt; around &lt; / i &gt; the house .
oh ... are we nervous , dr. cooper ?
no .
what you see
is a man trembling with confidence .
does a locus coeruleus normally bleed that much ?
no . but your thumb does .
oh , dear .
yeah , &lt; i &gt; you &apos;re &lt; / i &gt; a biologist .
what are you doing here ?
i &apos;m on vacation .
social convention dictates
that i let my hair down at a local watering hole .
social convention is stupid .
what happened to your thumb ?
i have ten fingers and ten toes .
if i tell you a story about each one of them ,
we &apos;ll be here all day-- let &apos;s just move on .
what can i get you ?
ah , seeing as i &apos;m on vacation ,
调制成的加勒比海特色鸡尾酒
uh , pina colada seems appropriate .
extra pineapple slices , extra whipped cream ,
extra cherries , extra umbrellas ,
and , uh , hold the rum .
don &apos;t let me have too many of those .
hey , what are you guys doing here ?
we &apos;re grown men ; we drink at bars .
no and no .
everything okay with you and bernadette ?
oh , yeah , sure .
you and amy ? good ?
oh , better than good .
you know those girls text me every detail of their lives as it happens .
i &apos;m not signing a prenup .
all right , howard wolowitz , listen up .
you sign anything she puts in front of you ,
because you are the luckiest man alive .
if you let her go ,
there is no way you can find anyone else--
speaking on behalf of all women ,
it is not gonna happen ; we had a meeting .
and you , a grown man
fainting at the sight of a little blood .
excuse me ,
this is a fairly substantial wound .
you ...
amy ? amy ? amy ?
what do you want ?
i was kind of hoping i could continue vacationing in your laboratory .
after all , i did book the whole week .
do you honestly think you can just waltz back in here
after the way you behaved yesterday ?
i was not myself .
i had lost a lot of thumb blood .
that &apos;s not an apology .
that is your opinion .
i want a real apology .
i &apos;m sorry that you weren &apos;t able to ...
no .
... that my genius ...
no .
... that the soap was ...
sheldon .
fine .
sorry .
you &apos;re forgiven .
now , if you want to stay , get started on those beakers .
they &apos;re still dirty from yesterday .
next year i &apos;m going to epcot .
are you mad at me ?
no . i &apos;m not mad at you .
i just ...
wish you would have come to me ,
so i didn &apos;t have to hear it through the nerd @-@ vine .
so , what are we gonna do ?
you really want me to sign a prenup ?
i don &apos;t know .
my dad &apos;s pretty insistent on it , though .
why don &apos;t i talk to your dad , man @-@ to @-@ man ?
really ? oh , that &apos;d be so great !
done .
i should probably give you a heads @-@ up about a couple of things .
even though he &apos;s retired from the police force ,
he still carries his gun .
but don &apos;t worry , he won &apos;t shoot it .
it &apos;s more of a fashion statement .
okay .
and just to be safe , when you talk to him ,
don &apos;t bring up jimmy carter , gardeners ,
foreign people , homosexuals , sean penn ,
vatican ii , gun control , organic food ,
the designated hitter rule , recycling or the fact that you &apos;re jewish .
got it , got it .
will you e @-@ mail me that list ?
so the thing to watch for ,
if he &apos;s shouting at you , you &apos;re okay ,
but if he starts to get real quiet ,
leave as quickly as you can without making eye contact .
not in a straight line-- throw some zigs and zigs in there .
you know , this isn &apos;t that pressing .
why don &apos;t i talk to him about it in may .
in may you &apos;re gonna be on the international space station .
they got a phone .
