schmidt , i &apos;m not calling her .

knowing every year that i will be going
to the wild wild west charity auction for poverty
reminds me that no matter what , i &apos;m still a man .
and i can still motorboat a hot girl
who is also a member of the cherokee nation ,
which is not racist , because it is for a good cause .
somebody &apos;s in here !
we &apos;re leaving in 10 minutes . did you shave your legs ?
i will now .
front and backs ?

&apos;ello , caroline .
i still love you .
so much .
so much .
i &apos;m not calling her .
schmidt , i know you really want to go to this party ,
but wouldn &apos;t it be better
to find a girl who you really care about to motorboat ?
then maybe , if you &apos;re super @-@ lucky ,
you might find a girl who will motorboat you right back .
i don &apos;t think she knows what motorboating is .
jess ! we are leaving in five !
hey . - hey , coach , what &apos;s --

just a slob like one of us
look at us -- couple of losers .
we both got dumped .
geesh .
i &apos;m fine .
it was six months ago , so ...
do you know why she dumped you ?
i mean , she must have hurt you pretty bad .
no , no . it made no difference to me .
i just wanted to set her trash cans on fire .
so you &apos;re always just , like , wondering , like , &quot; what was it ?
was there something i could have done differently ? &quot;
you know what happens to people who keep it all inside ?
they get old and they get sad and they get weird ,
and then you &apos;re the old man , and you &apos;re yelling at the kids
who are running across your yard ,
and you &apos;re telling them , &quot; don &apos;t run across my yard .
my life &apos;s filled with regret . &quot;
you know , you can &apos;t just pretend like it didn &apos;t happen .
or i could pretend to be more like you , jess ,
and live on a sparkly rainbow
and drive a unicorn around and just sing all the time .
yeah , i think you should sing all the time .
no , i was being mean . i &apos;m not gonna do that , jess .
why not ? it &apos;s fun .
because i have a penis .
my name is nick ? i have a penis
and i &apos;m not gonna let any feelings out
