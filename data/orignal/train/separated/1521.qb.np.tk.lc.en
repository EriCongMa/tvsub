okay , gloria , just make sure jay doesn &apos;t find out .
oh . boy .
i just heard that .
you probably think there &apos;s something between me and gloria .
relax .
i couldn &apos;t be more relaxed if i was in a coma .
jay &apos;s grill was delivered .
she &apos;s keeping it under wraps
so i can be there when he sees it !
oh , my god !
i just got accepted into caltech .
you did ? !
that is incredible !
we &apos;re gonna have a famous scientist in the family !
uh , not that there &apos;s any shame in learning a trade .
air conditioners are always gonna break .
eh , i looked into it . it &apos;s a lot of classes .
honey , that is unbelievable .
it &apos;s hardly unbelievable .
super @-@ smart kid , super @-@ smart school .
i never doubted you .
that must feel great .
yep . pretty great .
what was that ?
i think that was my fault .
me too . why ?
i do this all the time .
she does these amazing things , and i &apos;m so used to it ,
i don &apos;t even make a big deal over caltech .
i got excited . doesn &apos;t that count ?
well , honey , you get excited over everything .
you &apos;re a born cheerleader .
i just need to make a really big fuss over alex today .
that &apos;s all .
i know -- you &apos;re upset
because i said that you were a born --
there &apos;s no such thing as a born cheerleader .
it takes hard work and sacrifice .
you know what a human pyramid
is without hours of training ?
10 obituaries .
i think my dad is really gonna enjoy returning his gift this year .
mitchell , i have some really sad news .
yes , you seem very broken up .
apparently , i had an uncle , uh , cyrus ,
who died and out of the blue
left me a pretty handsome sum .
i @-@ i guess he didn &apos;t have a lot of other kin .
okay , this is the one time i don &apos;t mind you saying &quot; kin . &quot;
now , when you say &quot; handsome , &quot;
are we talking carpool dad at lily &apos;s school
or are we in a more clooney / pitt area ?
i would say more harry hamlin .
that &apos;s not bad at --
that &apos;s not bad at all .
you know , and this is crazy , because , um , i just saw
that the upstairs unit went back on the market ,
and harry hamlin would almost equal a down payment , and --
i &apos;m -- i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m sorry .
look at me , spending your money .
no , mitchell , it &apos;s not my money .
it &apos;s our money .
i @-@ is this a sign , cam ?
i mean , we talk about it all the time .
we should buy that upstairs apartment .
i don &apos;t see a reason why not !
this is so exciting .
i know .
i &apos;m really proud of you ,
because there was a time
when i wouldn &apos;t have even seen this check .
oh , well , yes .
you know , i used to be quite the impulse buyer .
but i don &apos;t even recognize that guy anymore .
i love my new faux mink , daddy .
i forgot -- which gabor sister am i ?
y @-@ you &apos;re eva , the classy one , but listen .
we need to keep the tags on it , because it &apos;s going back .
well , then yours is going back , too .
no , that &apos;s a hard thing ,
because the saleslady said i look like dr. zhivago .
so , is that a birthday present for you
or an extremely late mid @-@ life crisis ?
i don &apos;t think &quot; extremely &quot; is necessary .
it &apos;s on loan -- kind of a weekend @-@ long test @-@ drive .
i walk into a store ,
they make me leave my backpack behind the counter .
it &apos;s an old car salesman &apos;s trick .
they &apos;re hoping i fall in love with it and never give it back .
but i can &apos;t justify buying it
any more than you can justify that hat .
little early for tequila , isn &apos;t it ?
it &apos;s for luke .
not sure that &apos;s better .
the last time he was here ,
he was eyeing this bottle the same way you look at me
when i wear that strappy sundress .
i do like that dress .
i am going to catch him red @-@ handed .
i am going to teach him a lesson .
but first i &apos;m going to refill this with water
in case he gets past me .
you know , we have a little time before the family comes .
why don &apos;t you throw that dress on and --
aw , damn it .
andy , can you get that ?
andy ?
sorry .
i tuned out when you started flirting
to give you some privacy .
i was seeing haley for the first time
since she came to visit me in the hospital .
she said some pretty heavy stuff .
if i &apos;m your elephant ,
you have a shot .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m trying to say , dummy .
she didn &apos;t know i heard .
i tried for a couple weeks to forget about it
and just go on with beth ,
but i couldn &apos;t stop thinking about haley .
so ... today &apos;s the day i &apos;m finally gonna have the big talk .
there &apos;s a cooler of drinks out back ! help yourselves !
where &apos;s haley ? is she coming ?
the last time haley informed me of her plans , she said ,
&quot; ha ha . i &apos;m going to cabo , and you &apos;re not . &quot;
she &apos;s the best .
get ready to see the best gift ever .
happy birthday !
it &apos;s a grill . i got a grill .
you had a wife , too .
didn &apos;t mean you couldn &apos;t trade up .
i give you the flame xl .
my client owns the company .
he gave me a crazy @-@ good deal .
25,000 wood propane btus .
that &apos;s ... plenty , right ?
no . electric rotisserie !
if god wants a hamburger ,
this is what she cooks it on .
but it &apos;s got all those doodads .
i don &apos;t know what to do with those doodads .
you &apos;re doing a great job
of hiding your excitement about this gift .
look . it &apos;s simplicity itself .
you just turn on the gas , hit the electric starter .
hit the electric starter .
phil , you might want to lay off --
i &apos;m fine .
healthy as ever .
i &apos;d know if you weren &apos;t , &apos; cause i just saw your skeleton .
okay , joe .
time for a nap in your new bed !
looking for something ?
uh , yeah -- you .
i just wanted to say what a nice party you put together .
the secret is to know what your guests want ,
and i know what you want .
hey , luke , quick lesson .
this is a coaster . it prevents rings .
thanks to you and your dr pepper ,
my teak end table upstairs looks like the olympic flag .
think , luke .
yes . think , luke .
did you get it ?
yep .
sweet mexican treasure .
i was born in florida , but thank you .
so , you really think you &apos;re gonna buy it ?
i mean , it makes sense .
we &apos;re kind of cramped where we are .
there she is -- our little genius .
she just got accepted to caltech .
oh , that &apos;s amazing !
it &apos;s not that big of a deal .
it &apos;s a huge deal !
that school pumps out nobel prize winners
the way my school pumped out stomachs .
enough , mom !
what was that about ?
i didn &apos;t make a big enough fuss
about her getting into caltech ,
and now she &apos;s making me pay .
well , if that &apos;s her giving you a hard time ,
i think you got off pretty easy .
well , that &apos;s true .
that one never really went through a rebellious phase .
remember how wild we were ?
were we ever !
were we ever ?
not really , no .
you had your summer of the red afro ,
and i dated the whitest puerto rican on earth .
oh , wayne .
hey , but it &apos;s not like we didn &apos;t separate
and strike out on our own .
am i right ?
yeah ! that &apos;s right .
dad bought me my house .
ours , too .
he loaned us the money for the down payment .
we never paid him back .
i &apos;ve always felt so guilty .
you know , he gave us our down payment , too .
are you sure that wasn &apos;t a gift ?
well , i never offered to pay him back . i don &apos;t know .
and then he just gave me this bonus at work .
what he must think of me .
it &apos;s so long ago now .
well , still .
i feel like i should offer to pay him back .
what -- no . n @-@ no . no , no , no , no , no , no , claire .
because then i &apos;m gonna have to pay him back ,
and i &apos;ll be stuck in the same shoe box
he bought me last time .
mitchell , he &apos;s not going to accept it .
it &apos;s just a gesture .
we do it so we feel more independent .
just do it .
do it !
do what ?
oh , nothing . you &apos;re busy .
not really .
phil &apos;s tinkering with the new grill ,
so you better collect some old photographs for the memorial .
do what ?
well , you probably don &apos;t remember this .
but , a while back ,
you gave us some money for a down payment .
very generously , i might add . yes .
and not just cause it &apos;s your birthday ...
that &apos;s right .
... but we wanted to at least make the offer
to pay ... you ... back .
mitchell , what are you doing ? i can &apos;t cash this .
now , dad , i--
you got to sign it first .
okay , in that case ,
i &apos;m gonna need to get the pen back from--
claire !
got one right here .
okay .
hey , you .
i didn &apos;t expect to see you here today .
how you feeling ?
better . turns out you don &apos;t even need an appendix .
i don &apos;t even miss it anymore .
it &apos;s like circuit city .
anyway , i &apos;ve been wanting to talk to you about something .
this house is fantastic .
i should have gone into the closet business .
right ?
i &apos;m giving him a tour . andy , this is will .
nice to meet you .
i &apos;m sorry . i have to take this .
it &apos;s the hospital .
he &apos;s a doctor .
i met him the same day i came to visit you in the hospital .
isn &apos;t that funny ?
super @-@ funny .
so , wait . what did you want to talk to me about ?
just that this little heck @-@ raiser
needs to take a nap , but he &apos;s been fighting it .
oh , i &apos;ve got an idea . luke had the same problem .
i &apos;m tired .
let &apos;s go to bed .
both of us ?
together ? me too ?
yes , because we are sleepy and it &apos;s nap time !
now wait . he &apos;ll climb in bed with us .
just give him a minute .
okay .
since we &apos;re just lying here ...
do you remember when you --
sorry about that .
oh ! gosh !
oh , gosh .
you &apos;re gone for two minutes ,
you come back and find us in the big @-@ boy bed .
i can only imagine what you &apos;re thinking .
that you &apos;re trying to get this little kid to take a nap ?
how smart is he ?
say something medical .
20cc , stat .
i don &apos;t understand a word , but it gets me going .
i mean , what kind of store policy is that ?
i @-@ i can &apos;t return a coat
that i put on one time at home ?
getting out of the shower .
yeah , you didn &apos;t help by pointing that out .
what are you gonna tell daddy ?
well , i guess i &apos;m just gonna tell him i made a mistake .
you know , like i say , sweetie ,
honesty is always the best policy .
unless ...
and stay with me here ...
where would i go ?
i convince your daddy to wait on the apartment upstairs
until i have enough time to sell your coat ,
and , if need be , even sell mine .
thanks for selling mine first , dr. chicago .
if i &apos;m reading this properly ,
i &apos;m supposed to put a lime in your mouth ,
salt on your stomach ,
and drink it out of your bellybutton .
you wish .
that &apos;ll get you there .
whoa , nelly .
hey , pace yourself ! this stuff is strong .
i &apos;ll know when i &apos;ve had enough .
i got it lit .
i could feel it inside the house .
they &apos;re gonna need dental records
to identify those chickens .
you &apos;ll be singing a different tune
once i pop on the rotisserie feature .
get ready for these birds and your head to spin .
that &apos;s moving pretty fast .
simple adjustment .
that seems to have ... sped it up .
h @-@ how about you skim dinner out of my pool ?
i &apos;ll get my old grill out .
why is this even a setting ? !
hey , where the hell did you go , you coward ?
oh , what , just cause dad took your money back ,
i &apos;m supposed to give him all mine , too ?
yes , yes . because it was your stupid idea . okay ?
oh , my god . how am i gonna tell cam
i gave away his entire inheritance ?
i don &apos;t know .
oh , hey ! is there a future doctor in the house ?
yeah , i think he &apos;s upstairs , feeling up haley .
no -- you , alex einstein .
whatever you &apos;re doing , please stop .
she &apos;s still mad .
yeah , so am i.
it &apos;s not fair , okay ?
dad gave you the same amount of money for your down payment .
what ? jay loaned us that money ?
oh , my god . you don &apos;t know . yes . yes .
makes you wonder what else she &apos;s lied about , huh ?
wait -- i &apos;ve owed jay money for 20 years ,
and you never told me ?
i didn &apos;t think you &apos;d want to take it .
i finally understand the invisible wall
that &apos;s been between jay and me all this time .
this is why we &apos;re not laughing about that crazy grill ,
taking an awesome selfie with it ,
posting it on instagram ,
sending hilarious e @-@ mails back and forth !
&quot; remember when the grill went nuts ? &quot;
&quot; oh , yeah . that was hilarious . &quot;
&quot; you &apos;re hilarious . &quot;
so what , he &apos;s a doctor ?
i could be a doctor .
i still have the white coat
from when i worked at the clinique counter .
hey . so , gloria says it &apos;s joe &apos;s bath time .
he just had one .
what &apos;s with the robe , hef ?
i don &apos;t know who that is , but i took off my shirt
to protect it from splash gordon over here .
adorbs .
can you grab me that juice box ?
yeah , sure .
anyway ...
like i was saying before ,
remember how , when i was in the hospital --
oh , no !
oh , man , this is gonna stain !
i need to take it off and soak it .
you could put on my shirt . it &apos;s hanging right there .
oh , thanks .
it &apos;s a little boxy . do you have a chunky belt ?
uh ... yeah , i guess .
i &apos;m kidding .
it &apos;s not like i &apos;m gonna be wearing this for long anyways .
wow . this looks bad .
and this looks even worse .
but there &apos;s a perfectly good explanation .
hey , babe . you spill something on your dress ?
really ? that was your first guess ?
yeah , i was giving andy a juice box .
mm . not to drink -- because i &apos;m a man .
okay , so , i &apos;m gonna go get a dress
and some shoes from gloria &apos;s closet .
what happened to your shoes ?
nothing .
okay .
i &apos;ve been watching the two of you ,
and it &apos;s pretty obvious .
finally .
you know how to make her laugh .
anyway , i got haley a little gift ,
and i want to write something cute on the card .
i thought you could help me , because --
because you &apos;re not good with words .
well , i &apos;m a doctor .
i can &apos;t admit i &apos;m not good at something .
but ... please ?
yeah . fine .
just ... write how you feel .
something like ...
&quot; dear haley , i know how eyes work ,
but i never knew how they sparkled until i -- &quot;
that could be macular degeneration .
just write .
we need to sober up .
right after i call an ex @-@ girlfriend .
i think i still love her .
hey . sorry we &apos;re late .
no , that &apos;s fine . no worries .
um , so , listen , my stupid sister --
look , i don &apos;t want that apartment anymore .
oh , me neither .
yeah , it &apos;s just that --
well , i thought you had your heart set on it .
i did , but then you made such a compelling case .
hey , mitch , i got to tell you , i was really impressed
with you paying back that loan .
i &apos;m sorry . what ? excuse me ?
i &apos;m sorry . i should be thanking you , too .
i forgot about that down payment i helped you guys with .
it was so long ago .
anyway , yeah .
nice birthday surprise .
you gave him my money , didn &apos;t you ?
your money ? i thought you said it was our money .
why would it be our money ?
you didn &apos;t even know my uncle remus .
wasn &apos;t it cyrus ?
i think i would know the name of the saint
that practically raised me .
i forgot to give grandpa his birthday crown .
wait a minute . what &apos;s this ?
does lily have a fur ?
oh , boy .
yeah , uh , let &apos;s see .
oh , it &apos;s from schwartzman &apos;s , huh ?
the same store that you and lily
just love to browse in every sunday after brunch .
well , if you must know , it was a surprise gift for you .
now it &apos;s going back , because you &apos;re a thief .
oh , well , then , i want to try it on .
no !
i want to try it on .
you &apos;ll just get attached .
well , it &apos;s a present for me ,
so i should be able to have a fitting of some sort .
of course it needs altering .
since when do you wear right off the rack ?
i &apos;m just not comfortable with vesuvius over there .
i hope you can get your money back .
&quot; money back &quot; -- there it is .
there &apos;s a shadow that &apos;s been cast
over this relationship for quite a while now .
is this about that time you were sleepwalking
and came in my tent and kissed my neck ?
somnamorousness --
the condition no one wants to talk about .
you &apos;re right about that .
this is actually much more embarrassing .
i just found out you lent us money for our down payment .
so ...
here .
paid back in full .
phil , is this because mitchell --
no . this is for me -- for us .
and though it may be long overdue ,
thank you .
you &apos;re welcome .
probably seems awkward , but ...
it &apos;s happening .
... could you throw that apron on me ?
you &apos;re not sleeping again ?
maybe we should have another pot of coffee .
that &apos;s a weird word , huh ? coffee . coffee . coffee .
amateur .
doctor ! i need your help .
i &apos;ve been drinking this tequila ,
and i cannot find the worm .
i think i just swallow it .
that &apos;s very serious .
that worm could eat your insides in a matter of hours .
well , there must be something she can do .
drink pickle juice .
the worm cannot survive in pickle juice .
is this enough ?
just .
thank you , doctor . i &apos;m feeling better already .
you got lucky .
the only other treatment is to freeze the worm to death
by lowering the body temperature with an ice bath .
i feel it inside of me .
no . i think it &apos;s inside of me .
i knew we should &apos;ve poured the tequila in your bellybutton .
that &apos;s why they have these systems in place .
i heard an expensive car pull out .
i figured you were in it .
oh , yeah , that was will going to the hospital .
i just came to get my dress .
um , he gave me this card , but he writes like a doctor .
can you read it for me ?
no . that sounds way too personal .
ohh , come on ! i visited you in the hospital .
just do it !
nah , i &apos;m okay .
can you just see if you can read it ? i can &apos;t .
i &apos;d rather not .
can you even read ?
can you please try ?
i &apos;ll try . yeah , no , i &apos;ll try .
thank you .
you &apos;re welcome .
&quot; dear haley , i know how eyes work ,
but i never knew how they sparkled
until i met you .
i know how hearts work ,
but i never knew they could sing
until i met you .
love , will . &quot;
oh , crap .
really ? i thought it was kind of sweet .
the doctor part , then it circled around back to you .
why does he have to be so into me , you know ?
we met like two weeks ago .
a gold heart ! really ?
i just -- i guess i &apos;m just more into the chase right now .
you know , like , the fun .
i &apos;m just not looking for anything serious .
well , it &apos;s good you know what you want --
before anyone got hurt .
yeah .
thanks .
of course i have the receipt .
ow ! ... kay , what if i didn &apos;t ?
oh , there she is !
okay , everybody , i want to make a toast !
oh , any excuse .
to my brilliant daughter ...
so , not you .
... who worked for 12 years to get into caltech ,
the most prestigious college --
mom , it &apos;s really not a big deal .
oh , honey , wait , wait , wait -- you said yourself
it &apos;s the best scientist school in the country .
well , i most definitely did not use those words .
congratulations , alex .
we expect great things from you --
unlike some of the other children in this family .
well , i snagged a doctor ,
so she must be talking about you .
i &apos;m very proud of you .
okay , well , i haven &apos;t even decided .
i still might go to my safety school .
great . now this .
if she goes to the other place ,
it &apos;s even more expensive .
it &apos;s not gonna happen . please .
she &apos;s just trying to punish me .
and don &apos;t worry about the money . i got my bonus .
yeah .
wait . what ? what did you do ?
did you pay back my dad ? please , please , please .
no , no , no .
yes , i did .
not that it changed anything .
okay , don &apos;t be mad at phil .
he &apos;s not the bad guy here . he is .
look at him , sitting over there
like he &apos;s the king of the world .
what father takes money from his own children ?
not like he needs it . he lives in this palace .
meanwhile , our whole family &apos;s
sharing a bathroom the size of his closet .
i know . i &apos;ve paced it out .
okay , what about me ?
my tears have barely dried ,
he stole my inheritance ,
and i &apos;m left holding the bag for two fur coats .
t @-@ two ? !
i can get three seasons of use out of it .
hey , this might give you a chuckle .
that money you all paid me back --
it &apos;s gonna cover the cost of that t @-@ bird .
isn &apos;t that funny how stuff works out ?
it sure is funny .
that &apos;s hilarious .
i can &apos;t . it &apos;s too cold .
it &apos;s either cold for
5 minutes or cold forever .
come on .
funny -- i always thought i &apos;d be found dead in a bird suit
at the bottom of the grand canyon .
you still will , buddy .
you still will .
if i ever catch you drinking again ,
your whole school is going to see this picture .
sh @-@ sh @-@ she tricked us .
i know .
as soon as we kill this worm , we &apos;re gonna get her back .
there &apos;s ... no ... worm !
not gonna help , kid .
you &apos;re right .
i can &apos;t drown my problems in alcohol .
well , you can , but that &apos;s water .
you &apos;re not really gonna turn down caltech ?
oh , please don &apos;t tell me what a great school it is ,
how i &apos;m gonna graduate in two years ,
and they &apos;re gonna name a country after me .
you &apos;re feeling some pressure .
what if i &apos;m the dumbest one there ?
someone has to be .
i could get there , be dumb ,
have a nervous breakdown --
you &apos;re going . i know you .
you &apos;ve never backed down from a challenge your whole life .
now , i could lie to you and tell you it &apos;s gonna be easy .
well , do that . i &apos;m vulnerable .
i &apos;ll believe you .
it &apos;s not . it &apos;s gonna be hard .
but you and i both know this is something you have to do .
&apos;cause if i don &apos;t , i &apos;ll regret it my whole life .
i know , i know .
yeah , that &apos;s part of it .
let &apos;s take a ride . want to show you something .
you &apos;re not gonna drive me into a bad neighborhood
to show me how lucky i am , are you ?
well , i would still have my money
if she hadn &apos;t tricked mitchell .
oh , and it &apos;s a shame you don &apos;t , cam .
&apos;cause then you could buy another one of those coats .
well , i didn &apos;t get anything i wanted !
jay didn &apos;t even like the world &apos;s most perfect grill .
come on !
the family needs a leader ,
and i can &apos;t do it forever .
you can handle it .
do i have to ?
heavy hangs the head .
you know , college might not be such a big , scary place
if i drove up the first --
not gonna happen .
okay .
your brother &apos;s in a bit of a spot money @-@ wise ,
and i don &apos;t want to embarrass him ,
so how about if i say
i &apos;m giving you both a gift ?
that way , he doesn &apos;t feel like a charity case .
well , if it &apos;s to help mitchell ...
thank you , honey .
s @-@ still s @-@ so cold .
m @-@ maybe some coffee would warm us up .
you have a problem .
so , listen , how about if i say
i &apos;m giving you both a gift ?
that way , your sister --
we &apos;ll take it .
yeah .
lily , we can get the hats .
yeah !
