he did this to these girls and then he put it up on a wall
for everyone to see . he was in this building !
these things are gonna have me knocked out for a while .
there &apos;s a spare key .
did you get what you were looking for ?
lorenzo , i--
don &apos;t .
they &apos;re gonna kill my brother
and i don &apos;t really even know him .
mrs. dilaurentis gave money to the carissimi group
to support charles .
you must be rhys matthews ?
that guy looks exactly like--
exactly like a dilaurentis .
we had birthday cake
that day at the arcade when jason and i met him .
he said it was the best birthday he ever had .
i &apos;ve been thinking about what i want .
your friend clark
he was meeting some guy named rhys matthews .
he works for the carissimi group
and we think that he might be working for charles .
i &apos;m sure they took your feelings into consideration .
and , yes , it sucks but it came from up high .
what ? the police ?
the school board .
what ?
they think your attendance could endanger
the other students &apos; safety .
and from what i understand about the gallery situation
i don &apos;t completely disagree .
i do .
they can &apos;t punish us .
it &apos;s not a punishment .
really ?
being disinvited to your own prom ?
what would you call it ?
a blessing .
if charles , a , whatever he calls himself
was bold enough to pull that stunt with the photos
he &apos;s not gonna be scared to crash a school party .
well , then , fill the ballroom with police .
it &apos;s a fairy @-@ tale theme . they can come as the village idiots .
you can still celebrate that night
in a quiet , more intimate way .
veronica &apos;s offered to host a small gathering
in the backyard barn .
you &apos;re kidding me .
seriously ?
why not ?
because it &apos;s filled with melissa &apos;s stuff .
how is that a banquet hall ?
you can roll up a rug .
and what ?
take our prom picture on top of a washer @-@ dryer ?
hanna , you don &apos;t have a choice .
if the school board doesn &apos;t want you at prom
or commencement ..
commencement ? wait .
we were barred from that too ?
so now we &apos;re not gonna graduate ?
you will graduate .
you just won &apos;t be walking across the stage
to get your diploma . you &apos;ll be ...
walking to the mailbox .
unbelievable .
i &apos;m sorry .
no , i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;ve spent the past two weeks
writing that stupid valedictorian speech
that i didn &apos;t even wanna give in the first place .
honey , the circumstances have changed
since you started that speech .
i know . it went from a pity @-@ toss to a humiliation @-@ hurl .
please , stop focusing on what you don &apos;t have
and focus on the fact that you &apos;re here
and you have four dear friends to celebrate with .
that barn is not big enough for us , our dates
and our poufy dresses .
you &apos;ll open a window .
that &apos;s what she said ?
oh , no . there was more .
she said something about hanging twinkly lights
on melissa &apos;s shower curtain .
but by that time , i was already halfway up the stairs .
i guess it could be worse .
really ? how ?
i &apos;m thinking .
ali , are you okay ?
yeah , i &apos;m fine .
even if we went to the real prom
who would we hang out with besides each other ?
that &apos;s true .
everyone would just stare at us like we were in some fishbowl .
and we wouldn &apos;t be safe .
we already know that charles has some twisted thing for formals .
we &apos;ve already been to one psycho @-@ prom that he hosted .
have you spoken to clark ?
no , i &apos;ve left him , like , five messages .
did you mention who we saw him meet up with ?
you didn &apos;t give me a name .
what about charles ?
he goes by rhys .
don &apos;t sweat it , ali . he &apos;ll forgive you .
if it were his brother on the suspect board
he would have done the same thing .
i gotta go to the bathroom .
could you call me ?
i don &apos;t know if , if you went out of town
or if your phone is not working ,
but i really need to talk to you , clark .
call me .
shouldn &apos;t the police be leaving these messages ..
and not you ?
aria , if , if you and your friends think
that this guy is in any way connected to charles--
i thought a lot of my friends were connected .
well , just look at what happened with andrew campbell .
he can barely say my name without spitting .
mom , what are you doing here ?
have you checked your emails ?
no , why ?
what , am i banned from here too ?
the contest judges finally saw your work .
you won first prize , aria .
what does that mean ?
it means there &apos;s a cash prize
and an internship waiting for you in l.a.
congratulations !
it starts the monday after school ends .
that &apos;s fantastic . right ?
wait , what if the police haven &apos;t caught him by then ?
well , honey , we have to believe
that they &apos;re closer than you think .
yeah , but what if they &apos;re not ?
i can &apos;t just go and hop on a plane .
what about my friends ?
none of us can move on until this thing is over .
aria , have @-@ have you been threatened by charles since the gallery ?
no , but that doesn &apos;t mean he &apos;s retired .
he &apos;s probably waiting for me at baggage claim .
aria , don &apos;t go there . let &apos;s just try and live in the moment .
really ? what moment ?
for all we know , charles is in spencer &apos;s barn right now
installing a lethal disco ball . which would make sense .
that &apos;s where this whole nightmare started .
you need a sandwich .
would it help if i were there ?
where ?
at spencer &apos;s .
the @-@ the barn prom .
i thought you said that you ..
that was when i was gonna be sharing a punch bowl
with a bunch of former students .
if you want me there , i will be there .
unless i have to dress up like a troll or something .
i don &apos;t , do i ?
so , why new york ?
my dad has some work there
so he thought it would be cool
if we spent a few days together .
well , can &apos;t you come home earlier so you don &apos;t miss the prom ?
we &apos;re all missing it .
you said we &apos;re just hanging out in spencer &apos;s barn
watching molly ringwald movies .
we could do that any day .
yeah , you know what ?
you &apos;re right . it doesn &apos;t matter anyway .
it &apos;s just a pity prom .
what ?
what &apos;s wrong ?
why are you bringing an industrial strength laptop with you ?
my dad wanted me to bring it .
he &apos;s ... slowly morphing into a techno geek .
one of his clients wanted him to build cabinets
for all of his electronic toys .
hey , what do you want from new york ?
nothing . honestly .
at least let me get you a new helmet .
will you stop ?
will you let me do something ?
will you go to prom with me ?
sorry , that &apos;s ..
not how i wanted to ask you .
i ... did wanna ask you , but ..
if @-@ if you think it &apos;s weird ..
yeah , it &apos;s weird .
i get it .
prom is so much pressure .
but this one &apos;s different . it &apos;s just us and--
emily , my old school has their prom the same night
and i told claire and some of my--
you shouldn &apos;t have to choose .
we &apos;ll just do something special together another time .
toby , wait !
what are you doing here ?
i just got your message , okay ?
they can &apos;t suspend you . this is all my fault--
spencer ..
just let me talk to tanner .
she needs to know that i sent you to the arcade
and that the candy was meant for me .
you had no idea what was in it .
stop . you didn &apos;t make me go there .
that was my choice .
yeah .
but lorenzo would never have gotten hurt if you weren &apos;t stoned .
and you never would have been stoned
if i had just admitted how messed up i was
when i came out of this place .
look , what happened happened .
maybe it was for the best .
how ?
&apos;cause that freak knows we &apos;re closing in on him
and the police are gonna catch him whether i &apos;m on the force or not .
how long ?
indefinitely .
there &apos;s an investigation and a hearing .
let me say something . please ?
they &apos;re not interested in anything you have to say .
i gotta go . i &apos;m expected in there .
i &apos;m gonna call you later .
wait , before you call his dad
why don &apos;t you just talk to caleb directly ?
there is no directly . he &apos;s not answering his phone .
i &apos;m calling his dad .
what &apos;s that ?
it &apos;s a necklace my grandmother gave me .
i wore it to my prom .
i thought maybe ...
hanna would wanna wear it too .
she &apos;s probably wearing sweats .
what ? why ? you all bought beautiful dresses .
yeah , and those dresses are now gonna be our dates .
no one wants to put on a ball gown and get splinters in their butt .
it &apos;s not that kind of barn .
it &apos;s that kind of a prom .
why isn &apos;t caleb coming ?
caleb &apos;s in new york .
yep , everyone &apos;s kind of scattered .
emily ...
you all have been robbed of so much already .
senior prom only comes around once .
downsized or not , dates or no dates .
you guys should put on those dresses and dance and ..
feel beautiful .
well , i guess i &apos;ll give this to her another time .
what &apos;s going on ?
caleb &apos;s not going to new york .
he packed that rambo @-@ laptop
because he &apos;s gonna hunt a down himself .
okay , how do you know that he &apos;s--
what else would it be , emily ?
that &apos;s why he &apos;s been awol .
and now he &apos;s gone all vigilante
and he still doesn &apos;t think that he &apos;s gonna get himself killed .
answer your phone , damn it .
hello ?
charles ?
is that you ?
i can &apos;t go to that school prom .
i &apos;m not gonna be there .
please . charles , talk to me .
sorry i &apos;m late . my physical therapist is a talker .
can i get you a coffee or ...
no , i &apos;m good .
what &apos;s this about ?
well , how is your arm ?
still attached .
are you still in a lot of pain ?
spencer , you didn &apos;t call me here for a medical update .
and you don &apos;t have to apologize again .
it &apos;s not about me .
it &apos;s about alison .
look , i understand why you &apos;re angry .
okay , stealing that keycard was stupid and it was impulsive ,
and it put you in a really terrible position .
but she just didn &apos;t think it through .
you sure about that ?
because ever since i got to rosewood , all i &apos;ve heard about alison
is how she &apos;s a master planner and manipulator .
yeah , but you didn &apos;t believe that .
you gave her a chance .
i gave her more than that .
and look where we are .
look ... lorenzo , um ..
i know how you feel .
i mean , i have been used and abused by that girl
more times than i could possibly count .
but she has changed .
she &apos;s been through so much .
and she &apos;s desperate .
and i know that she needs you .
no , i think she got what she needed .
i think you &apos;re wrong .
alison &apos;s never had anyone like you in her whole life .
somebody who saw something in her that was vulnerable ...
and genuine .
i did ...
but i don &apos;t anymore .
and there &apos;s ... really no way you could ever forgive her ?
not yet .
okay . okay . look .
if you change your mind ...
we &apos;re having a promette ..
in the barn behind my house tonight .
and maybe you could ... surprise her .
maybe you could surprise yourself .
is that all seafood ?
that looks delicious .
do you want me to run it out to the girls ?
oh , god , no . this is for us .
they &apos;re having nachos .
did spencer give you a hard time about having us here ?
i know aria was not thrilled
that i was gonna be 30 feet from her prom .
you were closer to her when you were her english teacher .
what was that ?
was that thunder or music ?
that was probably hanna parking .
sorry .
i wasn &apos;t expecting to know
both the cops out front .
did that get us any insider info ?
are they closer to finding him ?
i &apos;m afraid that would take more than a pecan sandie .
besides , these aren &apos;t high @-@ ranking officers
so they wouldn &apos;t know anything .
well , as long as they stay awake for the next three hours
i am just grateful they &apos;re out there .
would anyone like a glass of cabernet ?
i don &apos;t think so .
not tonight .
no , i &apos;ll @-@ i &apos;ll pass .
well , i &apos;m not driving .
you know , since it &apos;s open ..
i &apos;ll have one .
me too .
you &apos;ll forward this to me , right ?
yeah . don &apos;t talk . just smile .
oh , no , you &apos;re not done .
i want some on my phone .
toby , can you just call someone at the station ?
hanna , when i turned in my badge
i got frostbite .
i can &apos;t call in any favors right now .
okay , if caleb has some crazy plan and you know about it--
i don &apos;t .
look at me when you say that .
i don &apos;t know what caleb is up to right now . i swear .
how did he keep this a secret for so long ?
not just him . both of them .
i mean , she was visiting him and letting kenneth
believe that their son was dead .
i could never keep something like that from my husband .
oh , please . you can &apos;t compare yourself to that family .
lying is like oxygen to them .
i mean , jason didn &apos;t even know that he wasn &apos;t kenneth &apos;s ..
oh , gosh , i spilled .
not enough .
okay , newsflash .
guess who noel kahn brought to the prom ?
bridget woo . and check this out .
she &apos;s 85 % tequila
and her dress is on backwards .
you okay ?
what &apos;s going on ?
nothing .
wow . bridget really should &apos;ve gone with a zipper .
wait till ali sees this .
where is she ?
alison ?
where do you think ? she likes to make an entrance .
am i supposed to know these people ?
no . you &apos;re just supposed to be looking at their outfits .
wait , is that a @-@ a lantern or a hat ?
that &apos;s her hair .
wait , lucas took jenna to the prom ? seriously ?
no , they &apos;re just standing next to each other .
yeah , holding hands .
she &apos;s tipping him .
she probably thinks he uber @-@ ed her there .
oh , my god .
did you guys just ...
yeah .
why ? what &apos;s wrong ?
alison went to prom .
he must &apos;ve lured her there .
who did ? why is she there ?
she &apos;s hoping to meet charles .
veronica , i &apos;m sorry .
we shouldn &apos;t have made you tell that story
about peter and jessica .
believe me , it was easier telling it than living it .
amen . been there , done that .
i &apos;m sorry , did i say that out loud ?
what &apos;s worse is i can &apos;t even spend time out here anymore
without being reminded of that woman .
that &apos;s where the dog dug her up .
i completely forgot .
well ... some of us can &apos;t .
should we check on the girls ?
i think we should check on our host .
the girls are fine .
clark .
hey .
you are here .
yeah , it &apos;s my prom .
what are you doing here ?
taking pictures .
you don &apos;t go to school here , clark .
you &apos;re in college .
who hired you ?
someone on the prom committee saw my pictures
at the contest .
look , i ..
i didn &apos;t wanna rub it in your face
when i found out you were off the guest list .
i &apos;m sorry .
my friends saw you , clark .
at that old doll factory .
what were you doing there ? who were you meeting ?
i don &apos;t think you wanna be photographing her .
get one of the ice sculpture before it melts .
and i suggest you and your pals
find the exit . voluntarily .
不要寻找狼 看见红色就够了 时间在流逝 ...
veronica , maybe you should eat something .
this is a beautiful tray .
i love it .
it wasn &apos;t bad enough
that this bitch tried to steal my husband
but her sicko son had to bury her in our backyard .
is it crystal ?
j @-@ just ten feet away from my lilacs .
maybe we should put on some music .
this deranged freak tried to frame my entire family .
maybe it wasn &apos;t charles .
i mean , i know that he put our daughters through hell
but i &apos;m just saying that maybe we can &apos;t pin all of this on him .
you can &apos;t possibly be defending--
no , no , not at all , i &apos;m just
i &apos;m just saying that
maybe somebody else buried jessica out there .
like who ?
like her husband .
i mean , from what i &apos;ve heard ,
it could be revenge .
for all the years she kept this kid a secret .
maybe he wanted peter to discover the body .
maybe ... we should ask him .
who ?
kenneth .
where are you going ?
to get an answer .
what ? wait . no , you can &apos;t do that .
oh , watch me .
ali , why didn &apos;t you come to the barn ?
did you hear from charles ? did he text you ?
so what if he did ?
i didn &apos;t ask you guys to follow me here !
you &apos;re gonna scare him away just like the arcade .
alison--
please . let me go .
just leave me alone . i know what i &apos;m doing .
sara ?
how did you know i ...
i stopped by the barn .
it was empty , so i figured ...
you aren &apos;t upset , are you ?
no .
of course not . i just ..
i can &apos;t believe you &apos;d leave your prom to come to--
this is where i felt i should be .
i didn &apos;t want the night to pass
without at least one great dance ... with you .
hello ?
kenneth ?
are you here ?
kenneth ?
why was the door open ?
maybe he just stepped out . his car is out there .
did you close that door ?
i &apos;m not leaving my fingerprints on that .
ken ?
if you &apos;re up there , come down .
it &apos;s veronica . i have a question for ya .
veronica , please don &apos;t .
you don &apos;t want to do this tonight .
oh , the hell i don &apos;t . kenneth !
i know you &apos;re here . i can see your scotch .
what &apos;s wrong ?
what is that ?
that &apos;s from the police .
it &apos;s an envelope they use for evidence .
is that ..
it must be .
don &apos;t do this .
let go .
look , if we scared him off , just consider it a gift .
please leave while you can .
you didn &apos;t get his text . he wasn &apos;t threatening .
ali .
i have to meet him .
please don &apos;t follow your worst instincts .
you don &apos;t get it .
you &apos;ve never understood me .
you never even liked me .
what are you talking about ?
he &apos;s not your brother , spencer . he &apos;s mine .
and i am not leaving until i can look him in the eye
and ask him why .
what did i ever do to make him hate me ?
caleb , where have you been ? why are you here ?
why are you here ? you &apos;re not supposed to be .
and you said you were in new york .
which was a lie . i talked to your dad .
you were never there .
yes , i was .
why ? what are you doing over there ?
i can &apos;t talk about it .
do i need to make an appointment ?
no . you need to dance with me .
i &apos;m not dancing with you .
yes , you are .
i &apos;m wearing the suit that you picked out for me
and it was a really long ride .
just one dance ... and then we &apos;ll talk .
i &apos;m confused . is mr. dilaurentis here or not ?
we &apos;re not sure .
are any of you part of the dilaurentis family ?
are you ?
we &apos;re neighbors . we were just--
no , wait , hold it .
i live next door . what is your business here ?
i &apos;m from the carissimi group .
a foundation that was sponsored
by mr. dilaurentis &apos; late wife .
i had some questions for him .
maybe i &apos;ll come back at a better time .
you know , maybe we should--
hanna thinks the carissimi group is connected to charles .
i think we just met charles .
charles ? is that you ?
dominic .
punch ?
thank you .
what &apos;s she doing now ?
sipping . what about him ?
shooting mindy and cindy .
you know , may @-@ maybe he &apos;s telling the truth .
or he &apos;s here
because he texted alison for his boss .
well , he is a legitimate photographer .
well , he must &apos;ve tricked her into this .
he &apos;s seriously freaking me out .
hey , relax . i &apos;m here .
why would she say that ?
why would she say that i never even liked her ?
well , because she hasn &apos;t always been
the easiest person to like .
yeah , but we came here to protect her .
that &apos;s all any of us have been trying to do for weeks .
years .
we basically missed out on our high school experience
trying to solve the mystery that is alison .
the only reason we survived is because we had each other .
is that what your speech is about ?
for commencement ?
oh , my god .
just forget about the stupid speech .
nobody &apos;s ever gonna hear it .
thanks again . you didn &apos;t have to do this .
emily , i just want you to know
whatever happens ..
... you mean a lot to me .
ezra ..
... i don &apos;t want you to come with me to la .
what ?
when i go there this summer for my internship ..
... i need to go alone .
i saw your airline confirmation on your phone .
i ... i know that you bought a ticket to la .
ahem , did you also see that it was a ..
... a layover on my way to thailand ?
what ?
yeah , it &apos;s a , it &apos;s a connecting flight .
i &apos;m not following you to la , aria .
but i &apos;m not ..
... sticking around here either .
i just , i @-@ i decided to join the habitat group
sooner rather than later .
oh , you &apos;re going to thailand for the summer ?
yeah .
do you think that &apos;s a mistake ?
no . god , no . i ..
that &apos;s a great idea .
you need to move on .
yeah .
a change could be good for both of us .
yeah .
did you write about your friends ?
i wrote about what it means to support someone unconditionally
even when they haven &apos;t been entirely honest with you .
and how everybody needs somebody to be inspired by .
somebody who sets the bar really high .
somebody who &apos;ll put someone else &apos;s needs
before their own ..
... and then not resent them for it .
somebody who always expects you to do the right thing ..
... and then forgives you when you don &apos;t .
i think your mother would be pretty moved by that .
yeah , she might be .
but i wrote it about you .
crap .
what ?
we lost her .
are there more pictures of him around here ?
how much more do you need to see ?
they clearly share the same dna .
we do not need to be looking for more photographs .
if we really think that &apos;s charles ,
there are two cop cars sitting outside .
jessica probably had her secret stash of old photos .
no , no , no . we are not opening drawers now .
that is trespassing .
what was that ?
it came from the basement .
that &apos;s where he is .
no , no , no , wait .
kenneth ?
are you here ? i wanna talk to you .
look , we know you &apos;re here . we heard you .
what just happened ?
who locked that ?
open the door !
come on !
open the door !
okay , you said one dance .
this is more than i danced at the katy perry concert .
if you were in new york , what were you doing there ?
getting a job .
what ? you already have a job .
not one that will pay for a move to new york .
yeah , that job is called bank robber .
and who &apos;s moving to new york ?
we are .
if that &apos;s still your dream .
hanna , i @-@ i had to sign a waiver .
but ... i &apos;m officially an information risk analyst .
what &apos;s that ?
i keep the hackers out .
for who ?
i can &apos;t even tell you the name of the company .
caleb .
hannah , it &apos;s real . okay ?
and it pays enough to cover your tuition
and a place for us to live
that &apos;s bigger than that girl &apos;s hair .
wait , so this has nothing to do with a ?
just getting away from him .
let &apos;s find another way outta here .
who slammed the door ? don &apos;t tell me that was just the wind .
the wind has a name . charles .
and we were in the same room as that animal .
i &apos;m sure he &apos;s still upstairs .
no , he &apos;s probably in my yard
on his way to the barn .
okay , there are police right outside .
who cannot hear us .
why didn &apos;t any of us bring a phone ?
okay , let &apos;s find another way out .
what is this ? what &apos;s behind this ?
天 你的眼睛这么大 好好利用起来 时间快到了
move !
what &apos;s the rush , clark ?
we know who hired you for this party .
where is he ? where &apos;s charles ?
look , get out of the way .
you guys are totally off base .
whose photo did you plan on shooting with this ?
look , get your hands off of me , alright ?
you guys have no idea what you &apos;re doing .
actually , i do . i &apos;m an officer .
so am i.
wait . w @-@ what &apos;s going on here ?
is it true ? is that real ?
wait a minute .
that whole time in the dark room ,
when i met you at hollis ...
how ?
undercover , aria .
now , please let me go do my job .
it &apos;s probably already too late .
you really had no idea ?
none .
well , at least you were safer than you thought .
where &apos;s alison ? is she with clark ?
we don &apos;t know .
charles .
stay there . don &apos;t move .
what ?
现在只剩我们俩了
shouldn &apos;t we just call the police ?
clark and i already called for backup .
where are the others ?
hanna and caleb are checking the coatrooms .
aria was checking the bathrooms .
somebody should check the kitchens .
where &apos;s alison ?
is she not here ?
she was , but ..
we can &apos;t find her .
but we will .
someone should check with the parking guys .
i &apos;ll @-@ i &apos;ll go check the exits .
i &apos;ll come with you .
lorenzo .
thank you for coming .
did you see any access to the backyard ?
no , i couldn &apos;t see access to my right hand .
it &apos;s pitch black and very tight ,
and i think there &apos;s something rotting in there .
please don &apos;t ask me to do that again .
how are we gonna get outta here ?
how did they get through it ?
our girls .
they went through this and much worse .
we had one job tonight .
one .
to keep them safe .
emily . this is ali &apos;s phone .
do you think this is--
yeah , who else ?
what &apos;s going on ?
is that ali &apos;s phone ?
where are you taking me ? where are we going ?
please ... charles .
talk to me .
