Hang on, hang on!
You're not gonna die today. Hang on.
Okay, okay. Come here.
Okay? All right.
Let's get the hell out of here.
Come on, come on.
What do we have?
Satellite imagery confirms
the factory's been hit and is burning.
All communications are down.
No audio or video in or out.
Where are you on search and rescue?
I have no authorization to dispatch the coast guard.
My people are on that rig.
That rig was a level-10 detention facility.
It does not exist. It never existed.
If you think I'm gonna let you and the director
cover your asses at the expense of the lives of my people,
then you've got another -- - Off the record --
the factory was bombed
to prevent those terrorists from getting their hands
on vital national secrets.
On the record -- this incident never occurred.
Look, if you're not interested in the detainees, fine.
But there are over 75 people who work for you
who are gonna drown and burn if you do nothing.
If you don't contact search and rescue, I will.
Do that, Agent Cooper, and you will be relieved of duty.
Without confirmation of survivors,
is it really worth making that call?
Reddington! Where's Keen?
Braxton took her.
Are any of these comms working?
That walkie has a range of a thousand yards at the most.
Unassisted, yeah,
but a dipole antenna array will boost the signal.
This rig is sinking.
If we can't make contact,
anyone here who doesn't burn is gonna drown.
You said Braxton took Keen. Why?
Where am I?
Where are agents Ressler and Navabi?
Did they make it?
Don't know.
Don't care.
How does it feel to have something
people are willing to die for
locked up in that pretty, little head of yours?
I don't know anything.
We'll see.
Look, I don't know who gave you clearance to land,
but we're closed to traum--
He's got a g--
Sir, I've been monitoring flights in and around
the Norton Sound with proximity to the factory.
The F.A.A. picked up an aircraft
entering Juneau airspace
I.D.'d as a private medevac chopper.
The F.A.A. doesn't require flight plans
or passenger manifests for medevac choppers.
I think that's how Braxton plans to disappear.
Where did they land?
Grace River Hospital.
Get a tac unit there and notify the hospital.
Make sure they have Braxton's mug shot.
That incident you insist didn't occur,
it just came to shore.
Okay, listen up.
Juneau PD was unable to apprehend Braxton,
but he was positively I.D.'d.
I want surveillance feeds from every camera
within 10 blocks of that hospital.
Sir, the coast guard --
they're picking up a signal from the factory.
That's some kind of S.O.S.
Survivors.
I'm making that call whether you like it or not.
We're on final approach.
We need a head count on survivors.
Helo two. Helo two.
Emergency message, plus three.
You're not going anywhere.
Let's go.
I'm hitting a wall.
She'll talk.
Oh, no. She's talking.
Told me everything she remembered,
which is nothing.
You saying she wasn't there?
I'm saying if she was there,
she's repressed her memory --
buried it so deep
that I can't even get her to talk about it.
The Fulcrum.
Where is it?
I envy you -- your ability to block a horrible memory.
I needed help to do that.
Lucky for me,
the person who helped me forget...
is gonna help you remember.
Max, I'm not gonna tell you to pick up your dominoes again.
Come on. We got to go. We're late.
Max?
Max?
Hey, doc.
Remember me?
Braxton.
Max, it's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay.
I don't know, doc.
Depends on you.
What do you want?
Let's go for a ride.
The princess here
has something in her head that I want.
It's a memory.
Now, you helped make all my memories go away.
You made Khafji disappear.
Boom! Just like a magic trick.
I'm thinking, if you were able to bury one of my memories,
then you can retrieve some of hers.
No. It's not that simple.
Mom, they --
they said they won't hurt me...
Max.
...if you do what they say, so please, Mom, plea--
Max. Don't hurt him.
Don't you hurt him.
Guys, there are people looking for me.
If they find me, they'll find you.
Now you are going to go into her head,
and you're going to retrieve a memory.
If you do that, if you help me,
you'll be helping Max.
Do I make myself clear?
Give him a list of everything you're gonna need.
Sebastian, brother. I didn't think you made it out.
He didn't.
I did.
Oh, man.
This is just like Belgrade, huh, boyo?
Whatever you want, I get.
This is nothing like Belgrade.
What was the name of that kid?
You know, the one you had running point?
I wish I could have been there
when you opened that closet door
and found him hanging by your necktie.
His name was Henkel.
Henkel! That's right.
Kid was a talker.
You're out of your depth, Luther.
You don't know the people you're dealing with.
You're a fine thief -- meticulous and careful --
but this is different.
You're improvising,
And you and I both know thinking on your feet
is not your strong suit, Luther.
You will make a mistake, and when you do,
I will be there to indulge in the undeniable pleasure
and sweet satisfaction of "I told you so."
Well, you better hurry.
'cause your girlfriend, the princess,
she's got the answers in her head that I'm looking for,
and I found a way to get them out.
I spoke with Cooper.
The coast guard pilots who transported us
are being debriefed.
As far as the rest of the world is concerned,
you are presumed missing.
You need to look for any known associates of Braxton's
with psychiatric medical training --
neurologists, psychiatrists, pharmacologists --
Wait. Slow down.
Braxton is trying to extract a memory from agent Keen.
He will do so by any means necessary.
He's likely contacted someone for that purpose already.
Find out who that someone is.
What memory?
A memory she has no memory of.
You said you had the situation under control.
I do. The strike on the factory was unsuccessful.
And now we have survivors to contend with.
Not to mention the incident at the public hospital.
The missile strike will be made public.
It will be blamed on, uh, inmate uprising,
which got out of hand.
Enemy combatants took the facility,
executed staff, and were preparing to escape.
We unfortunately had no other choice but to act aggressively.
Loss of life, although tragic, was unavoidable.
Director, is there any accounting for Reddington?
Or the Fulcrum.
We will have the Fulcrum in our hands very shortly.
How?
I have a team working on it as we speak.
Welcome back.
Sir, sir, I think I found a doctor
with a connection to Braxton.
You're safe.
Uh, w-- uh, what about Mr. Reddington?
He's, uh, pursuing his own leads.
Aram, the doctor?
Yes, right. Uh, sorry.
Okay. Her name is Dr. Selma Orchard.
She's an attending in neurology at Walter Reed
and was part of a team that discovered a gene
that makes it possible to erase memories.
I'm sorry. Erase memories?
Yeah, the gene is known as TET1,
and it's critical to a process called memory extinction,
where painful events are replaced
with more positive associations.
She was at Walter Reed. Was Braxton a soldier there?
First Gulf War.
He was part of a friendly fire incident
with multiple casualties in Khafji.
I assume he brought this home with him.
Orchard must have treated him at some point for this.
Selma Orchard -- find her now.
It's called recovered memory therapy.
I'm going to use a combination
of hypnotherapy and pharmaceuticals
to put you into a lucid, waking dream state.
My field is in blocking trauma.
Extracting it, there are probable risks.
You don't have to do this.
I'm going to give you a sedative.
The mind turns things off for a reason.
I found that what the mind fights,
the body tries to fight, too.
I need you relaxed. This is for your own safety.
He told me I need to take you back to a fire
26 years ago.
I don't want to go back.
I'm sorry.
PD says there's no sign of forced entry or foul play,
but Orchard never showed up for work.
I just got off the phone with the boy's school.
He never showed up, either.
Braxton has them.
Elizabeth, I want you to close your eyes.
Now I want you to relax all of the muscles in your body.
Pretend that you can float.
As you float, all of the tension leaves your body.
Tension floats, too,
but it floats away from you.
Now I want you to breathe in...
...and out.
Good.
All of the tension is floating away.
You can't even feel it anymore.
All you can feel is yourself,
making the image of yourself
clearer and clearer.
Focus on that image of yourself.
Only it's not you today.
It's you 26 years ago.
You can almost picture her, that little girl.
I'm gonna ask the little girl to open her eyes.
Are you ready?
Three...
two...
one.
What do you see?
A little girl...
hiding.
Okay, stay here, sweetie.
No matter what happens, you need to stay here
and not come out until I come get you. Understand?
Are you with her?
Yes.
Where is she?
Hey, what's your bunny's name?
I'm not leaving without Masha.
Masha!
She's not going back with you.
I know you're scared, but it's okay.
Lizzy? Can you hear me?
Hello. Thank you for coming on such short notice.
Time is of the essence, so I'll skip introductions.
I've asked you all here
because you all have one thing in common --
You all have business with Luther Braxton.
As rewarding as those relationships may have been,
they've come to an end.
Mr. Braxton has started something he cannot finish.
He'll likely reach out to one of you for help.
When he does,
you will contact me at the number I have provided.
Questions?
Good.
What's in it for us?
Life.
Where are we on Dr. Orchard?
Nowhere.
Uh, if Braxton did abduct her,
he didn't leave a trace.
And Reddington?
I'm pretty sure if he had a lead we would have heard from him.
Metro PD just called in a possible visual on Braxton
near Anacostia.
He saw him get into a van with a couple of men
an hour after Orchard's abduction.
Did they track it?
No, the patrolman was on foot.
The van left before he could flag the plate.
Get to Anacostia and canvass the neighborhood.
Knock on every door.
If Braxton was there to meet with someone,
I want to know who.
Cooper.
Hello, Dr. Levin.
Did you get the results?
Yes. At your office?
This is not gonna work like this.
These drugs, she could become hypertensive,
develop an arrhythmia.
I gave you everything you asked for.
Well, we should have an anesthesiologist
or an E.R. doc here to titrate her meds.
I told you there are risks.
Well, then take the risks.
It's either her or your boy.
What's happening, Elizabeth? Tell me.
They're shouting.
Who?
What are they saying?
Where is she?!
Listen, you're in trouble.
Because of you.
Don't be afraid.
You told her.
Yes, I did. I told her.
Come on!
Wait!
Come on!
Lizzy.
Come on.
Come on!
Wh-where'd he go?
Where'd he go?
I don't know.
What's happening?
She might be having a tangent memory.
Her brain is trying to replace a bad memory with a good one.
Over there! Here!
Catch me.
Lizzy.
Lizzy, wait!
What is it? What do you see?
Stay here.
Don't go anywhere.
What are they fighting about?
It's a secret.
Who's Masha?
You are.
...instead they framed Masha.
Don't go out there. You can't go out there.
Turn around, Lizzy! Go back!
No! No!
Don't! Daddy said not to come out!
Okay, we're done.
Her blood pressure's through the roof.
She's in v-tach. She needs Lidocaine.
What do you think you're doing?
You won't find what you're looking for if she's dead.
My father.
My father was there.
What have you got?
Braxton contacted me right after you left.
What's this?
Wiring instructions to an offshore account.
I'm not giving you this information.
I'm selling it.
Let me clarify the situation.
Braxton is holding a hostage. I want her back.
Every second you waste
reduces the chances of that happening.
I appreciate your urgency.
I don't think you do.
But I'm not telling you anything until we agree on a price.
I have units covering the southwest sector,
so start at the north end of the 700 block
and work your way back.
Anything?
Two eyewitnesses confirm
Braxton met with a Wilson Bishop.
I had Aram run his profile.
Turns out he's a third-year med student at Johns Hopkins.
What does Braxton want with a med student?
Your son, what's his name?
His name is Max.
He's nine years old.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry you got dragged into this.
In the dream, your father... you said he was there?
The girl, she called him "Daddy."
Did you see anything else or hear anything else?
The little girl stopped me.
It's like she has some kind of a secret.
But I'm the girl.
The girl's a piece of your subconscious
trying to prevent you from becoming aware
of what happened that night.
I have no recollection of my mother or my father...
not their faces, nothing.
All I know... or think I know...
is that my father gave me this.
You can relax.
An extra 15 seconds won't make a difference either way.
It's done.
Speak.
He needed a place to meet someone,
someplace out of the way.
The address?
No, no.
He's right.
An extra 15 seconds probably won't change anything, hmm?
Yes?
Mom? Mommy?
Max!
Mom?
Max, hi.
Are you okay, baby?
Where are you?
Everything's gonna be okay.
I love you.
I love you.
You have till 9:00.
If I don't find out what the agent knows by then,
you'll never see your boy again.
Wait. Wait!
Damn it!
It's gonna be fine.
It's too dangerous.
Something happened that night,
something people are willing to kill to find out,
and whatever it was involved my father.
I'm not doing this for Braxton or for you.
I'm doing it for me. I need to know the truth.
Where is it?
I'll have it to you by 9:00.
I thought you said you had it already.
And I do.
I wanted that Fulcrum in my hands
before I negotiated with you.
Need I remind you that the price had already been set?
That was before you volleyed missiles at me and my men.
Now the price has gone up.
Mr. Braxton, I don't think you fully appreciate
the power of the people who have engaged your services.
Well, if they're that powerful,
then I'm sure they can afford an extra 10%.
Go find the money, chief.
You do that,
and I'll have what you want by 9:00.
Hey, I want you to call me
just as soon as you get confirmation of funds.
Nah, we're gonna get the intel out of that girl's head,
even if I got to drill a hole in her skull
and hang her upside down.
All right.
Will do.
If you're looking for your driver,
he's napping in the trunk.
Son of a bitch.
Luther, I never thought I'd enjoy
having anything in my mouth
as much as petty officer Virginia Sherman,
but this...
My God!
It tastes so good!
I hesitate to swallow,
and I certainly don't want to spit it out.
Oh, what the hell.
I told you so.
Elizabeth Keen.
Where is she?
I don't know.
Maybe she's dead.
Maybe you're too late, boyo.
Just like you were for, uh, Henkel...
in Belgrade.
Can I let you in on a little secret about Belgrade?
I barely remember it.
I'd forgotten all about the Deutsche marks,
and I don't think I ever even met Henkel.
Tell you the truth -- I don't think his name was Henkel.
I don't know who the hell he was, but this --
This, I can promise you,
I will always remember.
Now get in the damn car.
Elizabeth, can you hear me?
Nod if you can hear me.
Good.
Now follow my voice and tell me where you are.
The closet.
What's happening?
They'll kill you if you don't give it back to them.
They'll kill me if I do.
They're arguing.
What are they arguing about?
Did you really think I'd let it happen
and I wouldn't come for her?
The Fulcrum.
It's the only thing keeping me alive.
Wilson Bishop, FBI.
Come here. Come here.
What are you doing, man? What are you doing?
Luther Braxton.
We know you met with him.
I don't know what you're talking about.
You're a resident at a hospital
with access to all kinds of psychopharmaceuticals.
We know you sold to him.
He kidnapped an FBI agent.
I don't know anything about a kidnapping.
He's gonna use your drugs on that agent.
She dies...
He wanted diazoxide.
Naloxone.
Where is he?
He had me deliver equipment...
for sedations.
An address?!
Braxton, call me back. Where the hell are you?
Is she okay?
I'm not gonna hurt you.
Is she okay?
Aram, we found Wilson Bishop.
We're en route,
and we need you to send units to Coal Chute and Spring.
Donald.
I have information regarding Agent Keen's abductor.
We're on the way to her now. We're 10 minutes out.
Well, Braxton was holding a young boy.
His name is Max Orchard.
My people have secured the boy, but you need to send a unit.
Dembe will give you the address.
Max is my son.
The FBI are on their way to him now.
She's still heavily sedated.
What happened?
But my son... Max.
Your son is gonna be fine.
Tell me about Agent Keen.
She was undergoing a procedure called RM Therapy.
Braxton was searching for a memory.
Does she remember the past?
Pieces.
What pieces?
A fire, an argument.
She remembers something called the Fulcrum.
Does she know where it is -- the Fulcrum?
No.
But we were close.
If she continued, would it be dangerous for her?
Could she be harmed in any way?
It's hard to say. She's been through a lot.
But typically, if the therapy is done properly
and with great care,
then no.
Can you see it? Can you hear me, Lizzy?
Take her to...
I need you to tell me where it is.
Where is the Fulcrum, Lizzy?
Let me go! Get away from me!
You don't want to see this.
What you want to see,
what you need to find is the Fulcrum.
Where is it, Lizzy?
Can you see it?
Lizzy, turn around.
Go back.
Stop!
You don't want to go in there.
Get away!
Lizzy, turn around and go back.
Go back, go back.
Let go!
What happened?
What'd she see?
Listen to me.
You have to say something. There's a fire.
I know you saw something out there
and you don't want to go out there
but you can't stay here.
You have to scream. Do you hear me?
As loud as you can, you have to scream!
You have to...
What the hell are you doing to her?
What are you doing?
Get her up. Wake her up now.
Not now.
Reddington. Reddington!
It's not safe.
Wake her up now.
Wait.
Not now.
You do what you have to do. You do it now!
Wait.
Daddy! No!
You were there.
You were there, weren't you?
Yes.
There were...
people with the woman, looking for it.
The Fulcrum.
You were one of them.
It's not that simple.
But that's why you were there.
That's why you came into my life then.
And that's why you're here now.
Not because of me
or who I am to you,
whatever connection we might have,
but because of some...
object.
Some thing.
Whatever you remember --
What I remember is leaving my father dying
on the floor of a burning house.
There's no way he could have survived that.
Lizzy, the memories of a four-year-old are...
unreliable.
My father was killed because of the Fulcrum,
because you and your people came for it that night.
Well, I want you to know something.
This charade...
of you pretending to care about me
was a waste of your time
because I don't know where it is.
Don't!
Mommy.
Max!
Are you okay? Are you okay? Are you okay?
Look at you.
Thank God.
I'm meeting with Braxton within the hour.
Yes, of course I've discussed contingencies
regarding Reddington with all of our colleagues.
I'm going to have to call you back.
You wouldn't believe how much he weighs.
Sit.
Do you have any idea who I am?
Yes.
I know just what you are.
Sit the hell down.
I've alerted security.
You seem younger in person than you appear to be
when lurking in the background on television.
Are you a swimmer?
I'm someone not to be trifled with.
Then we have something in common.
You hire a simple thief to find the Fulcrum
because you believe I don't have it.
So I return him to you, defects and all,
to make it abundantly clear that you should never again
doubt who I am and what I have.
I know exactly who you are.
A thug.
You may have convinced some of my colleagues
that you are a force to be reckoned with,
but I do not share that assessment.
So consider yourself warned.
We will not hesitate to use every resource
at our disposal.
Whatever it takes...
we will cripple you.
I don't think you have any real comprehension
of the depth and breadth of your vulnerability.
But only the one who possesses the Fulcrum
could possibly fathom that.
I think you're bluffing.
I don't think you have it.
I don't think you ever did.
Try me.
Call my bluff.
Please.
Call my bluff.
Oh, my God.
I don't know what the hell you're gonna do with him.
Honestly, he's like a damn side of beef.
You're not gonna believe this.
What is it?
This morning, there was an attempted takeover...
...of a U.S. detention camp in the Norton Sound.
We believe that the timing of this uprising
...was set to coincide with the transfer...
of international fugitive Raymond Reddington.
Are you saying that he was responsible for the breach?
How did he orchestrate an attack if he was in custody?
I-I'm not going to be taking any questions right now,
but I can confirm
that the whereabouts of Raymond Reddington
are unknown.
Thank you for meeting me.
You said it was urgent?
I didn't mean to alarm you,
but I thought you should know that during the RM therapy,
when you were under, I saw something.
So, what? What does that mean?
Based on how you responded...
Liz, I don't think I'm the first one...
who's looked into your memory.
No. I've never been treated.
You may not remember.
You may have been very young.
But I think someone may have tried to block...
your memory of that fire.
I didn't make it up.
The people and the events may have been there,
but in different roles.
I know this is difficult to comprehend.
Are you telling me I may never know
what really happened that night?
I'm telling you that the only
people who could tell you what really happened...
...are the people who want you to forget.
