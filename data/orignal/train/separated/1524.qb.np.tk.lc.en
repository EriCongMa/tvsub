okay , lily .
i got the list of what you need for your project .
uh , glitter glue ...
okay .
glitter dots ...
glitter ... paper .
mrs. daniels says my projects have too much glitter .
okay , well , she needs a mr. daniels ,
because a project can &apos;t have too much pizzazz .
it &apos;s a report on the potato famine .
i &apos;m -- i &apos;m sorry . do irish tears not sparkle ?
okay . okay . sorry .
longinus , jotham .
hi , guys . what &apos;s up ?
oh , nothing , just picking up supplies to make signs
for the big protest .
yes .
oh , right . right , yes .
uh , uh , w-- and which big protest is --
we &apos;re picketing the jai alai lounge for obvious reasons .
obviously .
obviously .
obviously , yes .
what reasons , daddy ?
um , well , jotham , y @-@ you tell her .
it makes me so angry , i can &apos;t even say it out loud .
so upset .
all we know is the jai alai lounge
has the single best burger in the country ...
if not the universe .
the jai alai burger is 1 / 4 @-@ pound ...... prime angus ,
1 / 3 .
uh , fresh , crispy lettuce ...
butter lettuce .
a sauce delivered from heaven ...
from kansas city .
all on a perfectly toasted , fresh @-@ baked bun .
with sesame seeds .
i wanted to have it as our wedding cake .
maybe for your next one .
so , who &apos;s this &quot; we &quot; that &apos;s picketing ?
every week , a group of us get together
to protest those who have been holding back the gay cause .
why haven &apos;t we ever been invited ?
it &apos;s just that you &apos;re not that ...
political .
uh , um , you know , ever since ...
he knows i can see , right ?
we are very , very political people .
yes , we were just discussing ...
the potato famine of ireland .
yes .
i haven &apos;t had a potato in four years .
well , if you &apos;re honestly interested ,
we &apos;ll be out there on saturday at noon .
you should come join us .
we will .
yep . with bells .
yeah . that &apos;s just -- that &apos;s an expression . - oh , gosh .
these are for lily &apos;s project on the potato famine , actually .
oh , okay . bye .
well , all right .
see ya , guys .
bye .
see ya saturday , guys .
yeah , good to see you . bye .
oh , my god . can you believe that ?
yeah , he &apos;s a little hippy
for somebody that doesn &apos;t eat potatoes .
we were called into principal brown &apos;s office
one week before alex &apos;s graduation .
that can mean only one of two things .
either she &apos;s gonna be valedictorian
or they &apos;re giving an award for sexiest dad .
we &apos;re very proud of alex .
honey .
i &apos;m sorry .
i just feel like my whole life
has been building up to this point .
i know .
hello , dunphys .
so nice to be able to
give you some good news in one of these meetings .
how is haley , by the way ?
so sorry we &apos;re late . we --
what &apos;s she doing here ?
what &apos;s he doing here ?
well , alex and sanjay ,
after four years of spirited competition ,
i am very pleased to tell you
that you are the pali high class of 2015 --
co @-@ valedictorians !
that &apos;s amazing ! yes !
couldn &apos;t be more proud of the both of you , huh ?
what do you mean -- co @-@ valedictorians ?
&quot; co &quot; is the latin prefix for &quot; together . &quot;
but really , what do you mean -- co @-@ valedictorians ?
well , i thought there might be some aggressive questions
that , uh , made me nervous , and so i wrote down my remarks .
no , i &apos;m not trying to ruin your lives .
it &apos;s just that your gpas are tied
to the thousandth of a decimal point .
but my gpa &apos;s 4.645923 .
my gpa &apos;s 4.645923 .
she got an &quot; a- &quot; on the french final .
he got an &quot; a- &quot; on an english paper .
no .
this is a nightmare .
worst day of my life .
guys , we should be celebrating .
this is literally a win / win .
i didn &apos;t work my whole life for a tie .
no offense , principal brown , but you were a teaching major .
i &apos;d like to check the gpas myself .
have at it .
what is it with these two ?
i agree with them . ties are un @-@ american .
would you be happy if the super bowl ended in a tie ?
yes ! there &apos;d be twice as many parades !
there must be some way to determine
who the best student is .
well , unfortunately ,
all the final exams and the papers are in .
grades are closed .
not all the grades .
looks like the janitor finally fixed my chair .
what are you guys all doing here ?
what are the last two states to be admitted into the union ?
alaska and hawaii .
name two cabinet @-@ level positions .
that &apos;s easy .
there &apos;s a higher one for the glasses
and a lower one for the pots and the pans .
hey , don &apos;t get cocky .
when we started studying for this ,
you thought the secretary of defense job
was to guard &quot; da fence . &quot;
gloria &apos;s about to take her citizenship test .
this little jumping bean &apos;s about to become an american .
jumping beans are mexican .
once you &apos;re an american , you won &apos;t see the difference .
i got you a little gift to celebrate .
i know it &apos;s not much .
it &apos;s practically nothing .
it &apos;s america . it &apos;s fun .
aww , thank you , jay . i &apos;m so excited .
do you know that once i pass , i can serve on a jury ?
they still use the electric chair , right ?
we &apos;re back .
hola , javier .
how was &quot; take your son to not work &quot; day ?
how was life before radio ?
manny told me about your plans
to abandon your colombian roots .
really ? you &apos;re gonna lecture me on abandonment ?
you left to buy some diapers ,
and i saw you four years later .
if only you could let that go as easily as your homeland .
are they fighting or falling back in love ?
c @-@ cow !
cow ?
cow ? !
the woman who is abandoning her country
cannot remember the spanish word for cow .
it slipped my mind .
vaca .
there &apos;a taco truck parked outside my office .
well , it looks like you both have the same gym grade ,
but i do see here that neither of you
have completed this semester &apos;s mile run .
we were at a debate tournament .
which we won , thanks to me .
oh , please .
after your long @-@ winded summation on euthanasia ,
people wanted to kill themselves .
enough . we will do a makeup race .
and whoever wins gets to be valedictorian .
you &apos;re on .
this is crazy . are we all so obsessed with being number one
that we can &apos;t just celebrate this moment ?
yeah , i mean , it &apos;s the end of their senior year .
they &apos;re both into great colleges .
they should be off celebrating , playing hookey ,
going up to the lake house to go skinny @-@ dipping
with their friend &apos;s older brother who &apos;s home from college .
let &apos;s -- let &apos;s keep this general , claire . - okay . yeah .
the point is these are two amazing kids .
we should be celebrating them both .
mm , we &apos;re not surprised you would think that .
great .
wait . what ?
every parent wants to believe
that their child can compete with sanjay .
but alex can compete with sanjay .
that &apos;s why we &apos;re here .
sanjay was forming full sentences at 13 months .
alex had a poem published in highlights magazine
when she was 5 years old .
it was called &quot; mr. lamb buys a ham . &quot;
but really , it was about the holocaust .
when he was 16,
sanjay was the highest @-@ ranked chess player in the state .
when alex was 15,
she discovered a mistake in our taxes .
we owed a lot more money than i realized .
yes , we &apos;re very impressed with how much alex
has been able to accomplish , given her background .
you know what ? you &apos;re right .
let &apos;s settle this out on the track .
all right , coach tucker ,
i &apos;m assuming we can count on you to officiate .
well , now , normally ,
i don &apos;t like to be the center of attention .
that &apos;s fine . i &apos;ll get someone else .
i said i would do it .
alex &apos;s uncle cannot possibly be considered an impartial judge .
i &apos;m the gym teacher .
who else has the training to oversee this ?
anyone with a stopwatch ?
okay , you know what ? no need to humiliate me .
may the best child win .
oh , she will .
consider this moment gauntleted .
is that a word ?
hold your head up like it is .
vocabulary &apos;s mostly a matter of confidence .
i love that we &apos;re getting involved .
yeah , me , too .
i think we &apos;re really gonna send a strong message to whomever
to stop doing whatever it is he or she is doing .
oh , like &quot; shame &quot; doesn &apos;t cover 1,000 different things ?
okay . where is everybody ?
so like the gays to no @-@ show .
yeah , right ?
is there a sale at barney &apos;s that nobody told us about ?
seriously , is there ?
i don &apos;t know .
longinus and jotham do this all the time .
they -- they guilt us into doing something ,
and then they bail .
they did it at pepper &apos;s new year &apos;s steve party .
yeah , everybody had to dress as a famous steve .
steve austin .
steve martin .
they bailed ,
and we got stuck in a room full of sondheims .
how are you doing ?
my name is steve .
hi . excuse me .
table for two ?
no , no . god no .
have there been any protesters out front this afternoon ?
oh , the gay thing ? not today .
oh , of course .
we rush around all morning --
i haven &apos;t eaten breakfast -- and -- and for nothing .
and it couldn &apos;t smell any better in here .
we do have a table .
no , thank you .
no , we &apos;re not gonna compromise our principles just for ...
we &apos;ll take a booth away from the window .
in back . something in back ?
this way .
okay .
oh , my god . she &apos;s still going .
i know .
remember how winded she used to get
hauling around &quot; ulysses &quot; in the third grade ?
she &apos;s surprisingly graceful for being so uncoordinated .
i know . i was hoping to get a funny video of her falling .
but i don &apos;t think it &apos;s gonna happen .
my playlist ended two minutes ago . i heard all that .
honey , i know we were all just saying it before ,
but you could actually win this thing .
i wasn &apos;t just saying it . i will win .
nothing is going to ...
oh . there it is .
what &apos;s going on here ?
i &apos;m making sancocho .
yeah . you got your little colombian music going , huh ?
i know . so beautiful .
javier got to you , didn &apos;t he ?
no .
maybe a little bit .
gloria , don &apos;t listen to him . get rid of that squirrel stew .
i got a few special things here
to help celebrate you becoming an american .
look . kobe steaks .
bottle of scotch .
cigars .
you know that none of that is made in america .
buying them all was the american part .
jay , i &apos;m not in the mood .
i am having some doubts .
okay .
you listened to javier . now listen to me .
do you know why i want you to become an american citizen ?
because i fought for this country .
my father fought for this country .
because this country &apos;s all about freedom and opportunity ,
and i want you to share in that 100 % .
you &apos;re right . i want that , too .
i &apos;m so sorry .
hey , you &apos;re just a little scared .
i know what will help you feel better .
we &apos;ll fire up some steaks , we &apos;ll pour a little wine ,
you pop into those short shorts ,
i chase you around the living room --
that type of thing .
hey , mom .
um , i got invited
to my friend billy &apos;s house for dinner tonight .
don &apos;t worry . we &apos;re not gonna eat this .
we &apos;re gonna eat steak .
oh , good . there &apos;s no billy .
why the sudden change in menu ?
well , i was having some doubts , but jay made me feel better .
he told me the reason why he wants me to be an american .
oh , those long lines .
what long lines ?
the customs line .
oh , jay hates them when we come back from cabo .
what ?
that son of a bitch wants me to turn my back on my homeland
for an airport line ?
you know , i should at least make an appearance at billy &apos;s .
sanjay . what are you doing here ?
what are those ?
ankle weights .
okay . wrist weights .
why are you here ?
look , uh , tomorrow , it &apos;s all gonna be over ,
everything we &apos;ve been working for since we started school .
so , i @-@ i wanted to come by and say thanks .
i &apos;m not a doctor yet ,
but it seems like you &apos;re having some sort of brain episode .
no , i &apos;m serious . thank you for pushing me .
you know how hard it &apos;s been to keep up with you my whole life ?
uh , i have my gpa because of you .
i got into stanford because of you .
i &apos;ll admit i did spend about a few hundred extra hours
trying to be better than you .
i &apos;m gonna miss this when we go to college .
yeah , i guess i &apos;ll miss this , too .
i like you .
okay .
i mean like @-@ like ,
like how pierre curie liked marie curie .
i &apos;m sorry . i @-@ i went too far .
you smell pretty . i should go .
where &apos;s alex ? i made her a smoothie .
might have made it a little too healthy .
why are we so focused on helping alex win
when we could be working on making sanjay lose ?
talk to me .
okay , is there a manhole on the track ,
cause it &apos;s kind of important to my plan .
okay , that was weird . sanjay was just here .
he said that the best part of high school
was our competition , and ...
that he liked me .
oh , honey .
what ?
doesn &apos;t the timing seem a little suspicious to you ?
maybe , but he seemed really genuine .
classic psychological warfare .
i &apos;ve dealt with it in elite competitions .
i didn &apos;t realize it happened outside of cheerleading .
think about it , sweetie .
has he ever said anything nice to you before ?
no .
not even when i break out my fun blazer .
oh , my god . what is wrong with me ?
i can &apos;t believe i let him get in my head .
oh , he is going down .
tomorrow , sanjay patel begins a lifetime of second best .
enjoy your hydrox cookies
and your silver medal , mr. vice president !
you go , girl .
do we have any cookies ?
gloria .
howdy , hubby .
how about some grub before we turn on the nascar ?
i &apos;m not gonna lie , i like where this is going .
but , uh ... i &apos;m not sure i &apos;m supposed to .
ain &apos;t this what you wanted ?
the perfect american wife
to make your life more convenient ?
do you think that &apos;s an american accent ?
from texas .
manny told me that you want me to give up my heritage
so that you don &apos;t have to wait in line at the airport .
oh , i got to stop talking to that kid when i &apos;m drinking .
well , i &apos;m not gonna do it .
so say goodbye to your little american wife .
man , those shorts really take the sting
out of getting yelled at .
oh , my god , that burger was so good ,
i feel like i just cheated on you .
yeah , i heard the moaning . are we terrible people ?
i don &apos;t think we are . look , hear -- hear me out .
by eating those burgers , we denied them
from the sort of narrow @-@ minded homophobes
that would come to a restaurant like this .
okay , i don &apos;t totally follow , but i like where you ended up .
i @-@ i &apos;m just saying that we did the right thing by coming here ,
and i feel like -- oh , god , gays .
we &apos;re here ! we &apos;re queer !
we don &apos;t support corporations that contribute to super pacs
which don &apos;t support healthcare coverage for same @-@ sex partners !
oh , right .
right . that &apos;s why we &apos;re boycotting this place .
right .
we &apos;re here ! we &apos;re queer !
how are we supposed to fall in without them noticing ?
okay , it &apos;s just like double dutch .
just find the rhythm and jump in . go , go .
right now ?
yeah .
we &apos;re here ! we &apos;re queer !
we don &apos;t support corporations thatontribute to super pacs
which don &apos;t support healthcare corage for same @-@ sex partners !
we &apos;re here ! we &apos;re queer !
we don &apos;t support corporations that contribute to super pacs
which don &apos;t support ...
hey , you came !
well , well , well . what a surprise .
i don &apos;t know why this is a surprise .
we &apos;re very political people .
yes , there &apos;s not a week that goes by that we &apos;re not
deeply entrenched in the issues that face our community .
deeply . deeply .
and this whole , um , super pac thing ...
super pac .
it &apos;s -- it is infuriating .
mr. pritchett , you forgot your cellphone inside .
thank you . thank you .
see , uh , before you guys got here ,
we went in there ,
and we demanded a refund for our gift cards .
yes , we went into the belly of the beast .
so ... yes , we did .
sir , you forgot your food to go .
thank you .
and fed your bellies .
how could you ?
okay , before you get all superior ,
we hadn &apos;t eaten since breakfast .
it &apos;s a quarter to 1 : 00 .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m saying .
okay , you know what ? yes .
we went in there with the best of intentions ,
and we stumbled , but who amongst us hasn &apos;t ?
and , okay , isn &apos;t that what we &apos;re fighting for -- - yes .
the freedom to fall short of perfection
and still be judged by the same standard as everyone else ?
that .
thank you .
no .
didn &apos;t you hear our chant ? it was really quite clear .
it &apos;s quite long .
you know , look .
we want to be socially responsible .
we do .
we want to do the right thing .
but it &apos;s hard to keep track ...
so hard .
of all the companies that we like
and that we don &apos;t like .
don &apos;t like .
we &apos;re -- we &apos;re just trying to make it in this world ,
raise our daughter , get her to her soccer game .
not youth soccer federation .
&apos;cause if it &apos;s youth soccer federation --
i don &apos;t want to know .
oh , my god !
you know what ? sh @-@ shame ! shame !
shame ! shame on you .
you are no better than the people in that restaurant .
come on , cam let &apos;s go .
come on .
think they bought it ?
keep your head up . don &apos;t look back .
being right is mostly confidence .
okay , look . i &apos;m sorry .
we good ?
apparently not .
look , complaining about a line at an airport
is easier than admitting the truth about why i want you to become a citizen .
i guess it still bothers me
that you have all these ties to javier .
what ties ? what are you talking about ?
gloria delgado @-@ pritchett .
you still have his last name . you &apos;re both colombians .
when you and i come back to the country ,
we have to wait in separate lines
like we &apos;re not even in the same family .
i don &apos;t know .
i guess i just thought that if you committed to america ,
in some weird way , you &apos;d be recommitting to me .
that &apos;s the longest you &apos;ve ever been quiet ,
and it &apos;s terrifying .
i know nobody asked for my advice --
yet you &apos;re talking ..
i agree with jay .
let &apos;s hear him out .
don &apos;t do this for him , mom .
you &apos;re all over the place .
but you also shouldn &apos;t worry about what dad thinks .
i think you should become a citizen
because even back when we were alone in our apartment ,
this is what you always wanted .
remember sitting by the window ,
watching reruns of &quot; miami vice &quot; on the neighbor &apos;s tv ,
and all the bad guys were caught
and all the policemen had those -- those nice cars ?
we used to watch that
and think what an amazing country this was .
did a little research .
if mom isn &apos;t a citizen when jay
&quot; moves on to a better place , &quot;
we could be looking at a pretty hefty estate tax .
i don &apos;t want to sound insensitive ,
but i have acquired a real taste for truffles .
all right , kids , four laps .
first one to finish wins .
it &apos;s not rocket science , unfortunately for you ,
because i think you &apos;d find that easier .
you nervous ?
come on , alex ! you can do it !
i ran six miles the morning you were born !
you came out of the womb ready for this !
sanjay ! your 115 cousins are rooting for you !
why are you ignoring me ?
all right , on your mark .
look . i didn &apos;t mean to weird you out yesterday .
stop it . i &apos;m not falling for these little mind games .
get set .
it &apos;s not a game .
it &apos;s how i feel .
i said enough , sanjay .
run , sanjay !
what &apos;s happening ?
he must know something we don &apos;t .
stop running , alex ! it &apos;s a trap !
what are you doing ?
i was telling the truth yesterday .
i don &apos;t care if i lose valedictorian
if it &apos;ll prove that i really like you .
are -- are you serious ?
yes .
please don &apos;t laugh at me .
i &apos;m -- i &apos;m feeling very exposed with my skinny legs .
i @-@ i like your legs .
you do ?
well ... i love your hair .
and your smile .
and the way you roll your beautiful brown eyes
when someone gets an answer wrong .
i don &apos;t understand what &apos;s going on .
why isn &apos;t he running ?
we spent $ 1,200 on a skype session with usain bolt .
uh , i feel like we &apos;re about to kiss .
are we about to kiss , &apos; cause i &apos;ve never really --
oh , my god . they &apos;re kissing .
sanjay ! what are you doing ? !
get away from her !
oh , it &apos;s so cute .
he seems quite skilled at it .
okay , that &apos;s enough .
i @-@ i think -- i think we can dial it back .
so , co @-@ valedictorians it is .
i missed a tile demo at home depot for this ,
but good for you .
this is a land
where people of vastly different cultures
are brought together by their willingness to work hard
and their desire to succeed .
i &apos;m a better kisser than you are .
you &apos;re joking , right ? i &apos;m actually destroying you .
this is a land made great
by people standing up for what they believe .
what are you doing ?
um , you know what ?
i have decided that we -- we cannot eat these curly fries .
ba @-@ ba @-@ ba ! shake it .
the container , cam .
this is a beacon of freedom .
welcome to the united states of america .
that &apos;s your wife ?
pretty great country , huh ?
okay . you ready to begin ?
yes .
the united states government has how many branches ?
three .
correct .
what color are the stars on the american flag ?
white , but i feel like it &apos;s my duty to tell you
that you have a flag right behind you ,
so probably you need to ask me another question .
no need . congratulations , you passed .
what ? that &apos;s it ? two questions ?
and i have a cheat flag ? that &apos;s all it takes ?
yep , you &apos;ll get an official letter in the mail
with the details of your oath ceremony .
do you know how long i &apos;ve been studying for this ?
you &apos;re robbing me of the feeling of achievement .
ask me another question , and a hard one this time .
but you already passed -- - do it .
okay .
how many congress members are there ?
you know what ? it &apos;s too late . you &apos;ve already said that i passed .
