monica , that was the best thanksgiving dinner ever.it was so good .
i think you killed us .
i couldn &apos;t possibly eat another bite .
i need something sweet .
does anyone want to watch tv ?
monica , your remote doesn &apos;t work .
you have to lift it and point .
oh , forget it .
let &apos;s play that game where everyone says one thing they &apos;re thankful for .
i am thankful for this beautiful fall we &apos;ve been having .
very nice .
the other day , i was at the bus stop ...
... and this lovely fall breeze came and blew this chick &apos;s skirt up .
which reminds me , i &apos;m also thankful for thongs .
the one with the thanksgiving flashbacks
it &apos;s not so much an underpant as a feat of engineering .
it &apos;s amazing ... how much they can do with so little material .
and they play with your mind . is it there ? is it not there ?
are you aware that you &apos;re still talking ?
is anyone thankful for anything else besides a thong ?
i don &apos;t know . am i more thankful for my divorce or my eviction ?
and i didn &apos;t think you &apos;d be able to come up with anything .
i &apos;m sorry . this is the worst thanksgiving ever .
no no no i am the king of bad thanksgivings .
you can &apos;t swoop in with your bad marriage and take that away from me .
you &apos;re not going to tell about your parents &apos; divorce again , are you ?
come on ! i want to hear it .
it wouldn &apos;t be thanksgiving without chandler bumming us out .
it &apos;s a tradition , like the parade .
if the parade decided it was gay and abandoned its family .
now , chandler , dear ... just because we &apos;re getting a divorce doesn &apos;t mean we don &apos;t love you .
it just means ... he would rather sleep with the houseboy than with me .
more turkey , mr. chandler ?
every time you tell that story , that guy &apos;s accent gets thicker and thicker .
so are he and your dad still together ?
no . after they got their own place , the houseboy got his own houseboy .
should have heard his accent .
you &apos;re right , yours is worse . you &apos;re the king of bad thanksgivings .
i &apos;ve got one that &apos;s worse .
really ? worse than , &quot; more turkey , mr. chandler ? &quot;
did the little rich boy have a problem with the butler ? yes , mine &apos;s worse !
more bandages ! more bandages !
please , can i get some more bandages in here ? this man is
oh no
in this life , phoebe .
oh , this life . oh , okay.no , chandler &apos;s is worse .
it must be cool remembering stuff like that.i don &apos;t have any past @-@ life memories .
of course , you don &apos;t , sweetie . you &apos;re brand @-@ new .
i know monica &apos;s worst thanksgiving .
let &apos;s not tell this story.come on
i know ! it &apos;s the one where joey got monica &apos;s turkey stuck on his head .
what ? joey got a turkey stuck on his head ?
it &apos;s not like it sounds.it &apos;s exactly like it sounds
phoebe ?
joey ? what &apos;s going on ?
look
oh , my god ! i know ! it &apos;s stuck !
step.how did it get on ?
i put it on to scare chandler .
oh , my god ! monica &apos;s going to totally freak out !
help me get it off ! plus , it smells really bad in here .
of course it smells bad . you have your head up a dead animal &apos;s ass .
monica
did you get the turkey ? oh , my god !
who is that ? it &apos;s joey .
what @-@ what are you doing ? is this supposed to be funny ?
it &apos;s not supposed to be funny . it &apos;s supposed to be scary .
get that off now !
i can &apos;t . it &apos;s stuck !
well i don &apos;t care ! that @-@ that turkey has to feed 20 people at my parent &apos;s house and they &apos;re not going to eat it off your head !
hold on.let &apos;s just all think .
i got it ! phoebe , you pull.i &apos;ll spread the legs as wide as i can .
joey , now is not the time.sorry
count to three . one ... two ... three !
it worked ! i scared you ! i knew it !
i &apos;m over here , big guy .
yeah , you are !
i scared you !
you did look like an idiot .
i wasn &apos;t the only one who looked like an idiot .
remember when ross tried to say &quot; butternut squash ... &quot; and it came out , &quot; squatternut bosh &quot; ?
yeah , that &apos;s the same .
that &apos;s it . that &apos;s my worst thanksgiving .
oh wait ! that can &apos;t be the one rachel &apos;s talking about.she didn &apos;t even know that happened .
so , which one was it ?
i really don &apos;t want to tell this story .
reliving pain and getting depressed is what thanksgiving &apos;s all about .
for me , anyway.and , of course , the lndians .
of all people , you do not want me to tell this story .
what is that supposed to mean ?
monica , i think rachel &apos;s here !
i &apos;ll get it !
happy thanksgiving !
not for me.chip and i broke up .
why ? what happened ?
my parents are out of town , and chip was going to come over .
and you were going to give him ... your &quot; flower . &quot;
monica , can you just call it sex ? it really creeps me out when you call it that .
and by the way ... while we &apos;re at it , a guy &apos;s thing is not called his &quot; tenderness . &quot;
believe me .
rachel
happy thanksgiving.you too sweetheart
oh my !
everyone ... this is chandler.my roommate and lead singer of our band .
ross
this is monica.i &apos;m ross &apos; little sister .
okay
i &apos;m so glad you could come.we &apos;ve got plenty of food , so i hope you &apos;re hungry .
chandler hates thanksgiving and doesn &apos;t eat any thanksgiving food .
i &apos;m so glad you brought him here .
chandler i can make you some macaroni and cheese for dinner .
as long as the pilgrims didn &apos;t eat it .
damn it !
so uh , rach ? does it feel weird around here now ? you know , since i &apos;ve been away at college ?
not really.that &apos;s cool .
so did ...
so that &apos;s rachel , the girl you &apos;ve been writing all those songs about ?
might want to rethink the lyrics to &quot; she feels weird since i &apos;ve been gone . &quot;
i cannot believe chip dumped me for that slut nancy branson !
i am never going out with him again . i don &apos;t care how much he begs .
his begging days are over , now that he &apos;s with nancy branson .
i &apos;ve just had it with high @-@ school boys.they &apos;re just silly.they &apos;re just silly , stupid boys .
i &apos;ll start dating men .
i &apos;m sorry , judy.i couldn &apos;t find that bowl you and jack were looking for .
call them mom and dad , you loser .
monica
chandler
did you like the macaroni and cheese ?
it was great . you should be a chef .
okay
guess what.all this stuff about nancy being a slut was all a rumor .
chip dumped her , and he wants to come over to my house !
that is so great !
i know .
oh , gosh . listen , if you and chip do it tonight ... promise me you &apos;ll tell me everything .
totally . it &apos;s not that big a deal . we already kind of did it once .
but now you &apos;ll definitely know whether or not you did it.i know .
and chip promised that this time it &apos;d last at least for an entire song .
i &apos;m thinking of asking rachel out tonight ... maybe playing her that song we wrote last week .
&quot; emotional knapsack &quot; ? yes
right on !
but don &apos;t take long .
we &apos;re testing our fake ld &apos;s tonight.right , clifford alvarez ?
listen , roland cheng ...
... if things go well , i may be out with her all night .
dude , don &apos;t do that to me .
it &apos;s cool , you can stay here . my parents won &apos;t mind .
it &apos;s not that . i just don &apos;t want to be stuck here with your fat sister .
why don &apos;t you finish off these pies ? i don &apos;t have any more room in the fridge .
no , thank you .
judy , you did it.she &apos;s finally full !
i called you fat ? i don &apos;t even remember that .
maybe it &apos;d jog your memory ... if you guys played a little bit of &quot; emotional knapsack . &quot;
i &apos;m so sorry . i really am.i was an idiot back then .
i rushed the stage at a wham concert , for crying out loud !
i can &apos;t believe you called her fat .
i can &apos;t believe you let george michael slap you .
i am really sorry.that is terrible . i &apos;m so sorry .
that &apos;s not the thanksgiving i was talking about .
yes , it was.no , it wasn &apos;t.it was actually
thanksgiving &apos;s over . let &apos;s get ready for christmas.who wants to go get a christmas tree ?
i have the cutest christmas story .
we want to hear monica &apos;s story .
mine had a dwarf that got broke in half , but , you know , whatever .
so rachel , your mom tells me you changed your major again ?
i had to.there was never any parking by the psychology building .
rachel
love your new nose ! jack
dr. wolfson &apos;s an artist .
he removed my mole cluster.want to see ?
i &apos;ll get it.no ! please , let me .
happy thanksgiving .
your hair sure is different .
we were just talking about that.we can &apos;t believe how stupid we used to look .
where &apos;s monica ? she &apos;s upstairs .
monica , come down , everyone &apos;s here !
ross , rachel ... and the boy who hates thanksgiving .
chandler.oh , my god !
what &apos;s the matter ? is there something on my dress ?
you look so different .
terrific.that dress , that body ....
dude !
sorry .
yes , she &apos;s thin . it &apos;s wonderful .
but we really want to hear ... about ross &apos; new girlfriend.oh , mom
okay , her name is carol.she &apos;s really pretty and smart .
she &apos;s on the lacrosse team and the golf team.can you believe it ?
she plays for both teams .
so i guess i &apos;ll see you at dinner .
dude !
sorry .
oh , my god ! that was so awesome.you got him back for calling you fat .
he was drooling all over you.that must have felt so great .
lt didn &apos;t.what ?
yeah , i mean , i look great.i feel great , and my heart &apos;s not in trouble anymore .
i just don &apos;t feel like i got him back .
i just want to humiliate him .
i want him to be naked , and i want to point at him and laugh .
that , we may be able to do .
how ?
guys tend to get naked before they &apos;re going to have sex .
what ? i didn &apos;t work this hard and lose weight just so i could give my flower to someone like him .
first of all , if you keep calling it that , no one will take it .
and then second of all , you &apos;re not going to have sex with him.you &apos;ll just make him think that you are .
yes
i &apos;ll throw him out in the yard , lock the door ...
... and all our neighbors will just humiliate him !
you &apos;ll definitely get him back .
how do i make him think i want to have sex ?
here &apos;s what you do.just act like everything around you turns you on .
what do you mean ? anything can be sexy .
like this dish towel .
this feels so good against my cheek .
and if i get a little hot , i can just dab myself with it .
or i can bring it down to my side and run it through my fingers ... while i talk to him .
i can do that.good , good , good .
get busy . he &apos;s coming .
hey , what &apos;s up ?
could you make me some of that righteous mac and cheese like last year ?
i &apos;d love to .
i love macaroni and cheese .
i love the way this box feels against my cheek .
okay
and i love carrots .
sometimes i like to put them between my fingers .
like this.and hold them down here while i talk to you .
and , you know , if i get really hot ...
i like to pick up this knife.and i put the cool steel ... against
... my body .
are you all right ?
i &apos;m fine. it &apos;s just that ...
what do we got here
twenty @-@ year @-@ old male.he &apos;s got a severed toe on his right foot .
could you please not do that feet first ?
you know where his injury is . severed toe , you just said it !
it says the knife went through your shoe .
of course it did.they &apos;re made of wicker !
did you bring the toe ? -oh yes ! i have it right here on ice .
toes on ice , coming soon to madison square garden .
save your strength , man .
don &apos;t worry , son . we &apos;ll just reattach it and then ....
what is it ?
you brought a carrot .
what ?
this isn &apos;t your toe . this is a small , very cold piece of carrot .
you brought a carrot ?
oh , my god ! there &apos;s a toe in my kitchen .
i &apos;m sorry ! i &apos;ll go get it !
all we can do now is sew up the wound .
without my toe ? i need my toe !
i can go really fast ! dad , give me the keys to your porsche .
i &apos;m not falling for that one .
that &apos;s why i lost my toe ? because i called you fat ?
i didn &apos;t mean to cut it off . it was an accident .
that &apos;s why for an entire year people called me sir limps @-@ a @-@ lot ?
i &apos;m sorry.it wasn &apos;t your whole toe .
yeah , well , i miss the tip.it &apos;s the best part .
it has the nail .
chandler
sir limps @-@ a @-@ lot.i came up with that .
you &apos;re a dork .
i can &apos;t believe this .
i said i was sorry .
&quot; sorry &quot; doesn &apos;t bring back the piggy that cried all the way home .
it figures that something like this would happen today.i hate this stupid day and everything about it !
i &apos;ll see you later.wait.come here .
is there anything i can do ? anything ?
just leave me alone for a little while .
i &apos;m a duck . i go quack @-@ quack.i &apos;m happy all the time .
nice try.wait , wait , wait .
look , monica
this is not going to work .
i bet this will work .
you &apos;re so great.i love you .
what ?
nothing . i said you &apos;re so great , and then i just stopped talking
you said you loved me . i can &apos;t believe this !
no , i didn &apos;t !
yes , you did ! no , i didn &apos;t !
