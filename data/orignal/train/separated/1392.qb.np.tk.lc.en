oh , thank you so much for the donation .
i wish i could do more ,
it &apos;s just a bunch of old , outdated clothes .
oh , sure it &apos;s great .
3 weeks ago , our neighbours , the rand &apos;s
lost their house and everything they own in a fire .
foetunately nobody was hurt .
and fortunately , their friends ,
was wonder woman , over here .
i &apos;m hardly wonder woman .
she mobilized the community to donate clothes ,
furniture , appliances .
all to help them start over in their new rental .
which you found them .
i &apos;m no wonder woman .
rand @-@ aid was her idea .
it wasn &apos;t my idea to call it &quot; rand @-@ aid . &quot;
okay , fine .
i &apos;m wonder woman .
terrible tragedy .
they &apos;re our closest friends .
we know them .
uh , manny and their son reuben are tight .
in fact , i put in one of their closets .
not that it matters ,
but it was the only structure to survive the fire .
por favor , don &apos;t even say that word !
in my country it is considered very , very bad luck
when your house burns down .
they lived a block away from us .
smoke was everywhere .
i was so upset , i couldn &apos;t sleep for days .
of course , mitchell won &apos;t let me take anything .
well , cam , we both know why .
some people have been known to sleepwalk
or even sleep drive on that medication .
cam &apos;s reaction is much worse .
oh ! ohh ! oh , god .
i sleep clown .
dad , you &apos;re gonna kill yourself .
i got it ! we &apos;re on a schedule here .
i still have to pick up the truck .
if you want him to stop lifting things ,
put all this in grocery bags
and turn the tv on to a football game .
oh ! take this phone away from me !
why ?
two of our best brokers left to start their own agency ,
and the office gossip is flying .
but i want today to be about the rands ...
and if i have this-- oh , my god !
those guys took two secretaries and the tube dude with them !
who &apos;s the tube dude ?
you know , the blowy guy that attracts all the attention .
this guy ...
ah , si , i &apos;ve seen him .
he goes down over there , and then he shakes up .
and goes down in there , and then ...
you almost got it .
and then goes down .
hi , hi , sorry . we would have been here sooner ,
but this one had a wardrobe crisis .
you know , it &apos;s a somber occasion ,
and all my tops are too joyful .
you do not want our problems .
no .
oh , here , jay , let me help .
no , i got it .
aah ! my back !
dad !
no , jay , that &apos;s not quite it .
remember , you got air blowing through you ,
so it &apos;s more like ...
and then out . and then out .
第三季 第八集
leave me alone . i &apos;m fine .
i &apos;ve gotta pick up that truck .
i &apos;d be happy to get the truck .
i don &apos;t think so . it &apos;s a pretty big truck .
oh . is it--is it bigger than the combine
i &apos;ve been driving since i was 12 years old ?
or the widrow tractor with the macdon header
that i drove to and parallel parked at my high school prom ? hmm ?
at least something got plowed that night .
heard that !
oh , son of bitch !
your low back is in spasm , jay .
i can massage that out for you .
i &apos;m fine .
dad , you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re missing .
phil is a magician .
and a licensed masseur .
before i heard the siren song of residential real estate ,
i was bitten by the rub bug .
no , he &apos;s--he &apos;s amazing .
i had this knot in my leg ,
two minutes with phil and it was gone .
i &apos;m sorry , but i think you might have a higher tolerance
for a man &apos;s hands on your body than i do .
charming .
ay , don &apos;t be an idiot .
let phil help you .
fine .
great ! i &apos;ll just go get the room ready .
i &apos;ll think you &apos;ll be surprised with what these hands can do .
really ? can they drive a bobcat skid @-@ steer
with a bucket grapple through a school hallway on a dare ?
because these can and have .
poor reuben , huh ?
having to rebuild his whole life at age 12 .
yeah . that blows .
i know we &apos;re both shaken up ,
but let &apos;s watch the language .
okay , put this in a safe place . it &apos;s for reuben .
it &apos;s one of those , um ,
how do you say again , the takka @-@ takka @-@ takka ...
is that the helicopter with the camera in it ...
that you control with your phone ?
the one i asked for ?
okay , when your house burns down ,
you get one of these .
no , don &apos;t burn your house down .
how lucky is reuben ?
so lucky .
you know what ? i say we take this thing out
and see how she flies .
i don &apos;t know . my mom got it for reuben .
oh , so now he won &apos;t even share his toys ?
he never does .
screw that guy !
yeah !
you &apos;re a terrible influence .
you need me .
claire , in case you want to add something ,
i put the box of dresses outside
and this is the box of snicker snackers .
mm . thanks .
mitchell , we did have something to add to this box of , um ...
snicker snackers .
what ?
english is not her first language .
she &apos;s just trying to help .
mitchell , come on . you can &apos;t do that .
you can &apos;t just change the rules .
this is what we do .
when gloria says something silly ,
we innocently laugh behind her back .
she &apos;s had a rough week , all right ?
she &apos;s really worried about tia maria cecilia and that surgery .
oh , and then she lost her cell phone at pilates .
how do you know this ?
we have coffee .
oh . have ?
so when did this become , like , a thing ?
what &apos;s the big deal ? we &apos;re friends . i like gloria .
uh , it &apos;s no big deal .
i have nothing against her , i just think--oh !
mm . all right .
so before you get all judge @-@ y , i gave her that vase .
after i gave it to you .
you couldn &apos;t part with that t @-@ shirt ?
i love this shirt .
you know , you don &apos;t have to look the way you look .
amber rand lost all her clothes in a fire ,
but she gets to build herself a new wardrobe .
let me burn your clothes .
girls , get down here . there &apos;s a lot of work to do .
ugh . she &apos;s in a mood .
you know what we have to do , right ?
there &apos;s no way you &apos;re my real sister !
i hate you !
i can &apos;t believe you would ever--
you &apos;re the most selfish--
okay , that &apos;s it ! i cannot take the fighting !
just get out of the house .
works every time .
you know , i don &apos;t even wanna drive the truck anymore
even though on the farm i was--
i can &apos;t take another farm story .
yay !
you might wanna take someone with you .
the thing &apos;s been parked there six months .
you &apos;re gonna want to hose it down , sweep for spiders .
good news , girls . you &apos;re going with uncle cam .
yay !
the pain must have been pretty bad if i was asking phil for help .
his need for my approval is exhausting .
in ten years , i &apos;ve asked him for one thing--
to hook up my wireless printer .
he still won &apos;t shut up about it .
how &apos;s that printer working out for you ?
still loving that printer , eh ?
you know , if your printer breaks from here ,
i can fix it on my phone .
can you ?
i can , but i don &apos;t need to ,
because i fixed it forever .
just once , i wish he wouldn &apos;t make
such a big deal about everything .
okay .
now just disrobe and place the towel over your buttocks .
riding the open road
in a big rig like this
sure can work up a man &apos;s powerful appetite .
we &apos;ve gone five blocks .
do you want a burger or not ?
i could eat .
hey , alex ,
maybe uncle cam will let you borrow his hat later .
you know , since you dress like a dude .
i like the way i dress .
uncle cam , as her future prom date ,
will you please talk to her ? you know fashion .
first of all , you &apos;re each beautiful in your own way ,
but you &apos;re both playing for second ,
because i &apos;m too sexy for ... this truck .
i have to say , you do drive it surprisingly well .
yeah , who would have thought ?
surprising ?
what , that--that a gay man can drive a truck ?
you know , i expect that kind of thinking from jay &apos;s generation .
but from our future generation ?
no .
wow . this place got crowded .
whoa . you &apos;re really wedged in there .
you want us to help guide you out ?
that question--
it was like a hate crime .
sorry !
hey , you &apos;re really close on this side .
yeah , i see it .
careful !
i &apos;m being careful .
gasping ? really ?
holding hands ? we &apos;re not in a nosedive .
okay , you know what ,
if it would make you feel better , get out and guide me .
okay , come on . let &apos;s go .
please don &apos;t yell at me , but there &apos;s not enough room .
okay , climb over .
you &apos;re fine .
you know , the native americans believe that burning sage
kept bad energy away .
how &apos;d that work out for &apos; em ?
get to the back .
that &apos;s the spirit .
thank you .
i just need to make sure that the oil is a perfect 98.6 .
and it is perfect .
now i want you to take a deep breath
and let me transport you to a land
i call relaxistan .
oh , what the hell ? get off me .
i knew this was a terrible ...
oh , mama lucian , that &apos;s good .
so you wanna try it ?
i don &apos;t know . i &apos;m still feeling guilty .
it &apos;s reuben &apos;s helicopter .
reuben is the whole reason we should be doing this .
he &apos;s barely living proof that life can change in a second .
you gotta grab what you can when you can .
what is this hold you have on me ?
wow .
okay , now ease up .
okay , i &apos;m easing up . okay , it &apos;s not working .
get ahold of yourself , manny ! she &apos;s getting away !
i can &apos;t--i ... i can &apos;t hold her !
give it to me !
mayday ! mayday !
oh , well .
what do you mean &quot; oh , well &quot; ? my mom &apos;s gonna kill us .
us ? you were flying it .
i was in the attic packing boxes .
you &apos;re gonna help me find it ,
or the next search will be for you .
i like this guy . where &apos;s he been ?
just relax .
let me know if i &apos;m hurting you .
are you kidding me ? it &apos;s fantastic .
i love you .
this ! i love this !
it just slipped out .
those are the worst three words i could say to phil .
i was just praying he would let it go
and not make a big deal about it .
oh , my god .
this is huge .
jay , i &apos;m sorry .
i need a minute .
son of a bitch !
son of a bitch .
oh , these are fantastic . why is manny getting rid of them ?
he said that they were last season .
i used to have a pair like these .
i can never find &apos; em anymore .
oh , there &apos;s an outlet store .
they don &apos;t have men &apos;s size ,
but i &apos;m sure the biggest size for boys
would fit you perfectly . i &apos;ll take you .
all right . it &apos;s a date .
oh . another date .
claire , i heard what happened with the vase ,
but i don &apos;t want you to worry about it .
i &apos;m so sorry . i should have told you about that sooner .
it just--i have really been shaken by this whole fire thing .
you know , life is so fragile .
i know , like a vase .
you tattled on me ?
she asked me about it . what was i supposed to do ?
why are you making those cruel sounds with your mouth ?
you don &apos;t see it ?
you &apos;re turning gloria into mom .
what ?
first you got all defensive of her ,
and then you tattled on me to her .
that &apos;s exactly what you did with old mom .
it &apos;s what you &apos;re doing with new mom .
okay , okay .
only you could make my friendship with gloria
into something ugly .
don &apos;t get me wrong . i think it &apos;s sweet .
we &apos;ve all got our thing . you have mommy issues .
i do not have mommy issues !
okay . so i pick you up tomorrow ,
we go get you your big boy pants ,
and then we go and get a little ice cream , okay ?
perfect .
i don &apos;t wanna hear it .
you still don &apos;t feel very good ?
i told phil i loved him .
it was an accident .
you know how he gets with that stuff .
ay , i know .
jay , can i talk to you later about what just happened ?
yeah .
thanks .
jeez , i just worked that out .
you &apos;re screwed .
today is the biggest day of my life .
just relax .
let me know if i &apos;m hurting you .
are you kidding me ? it &apos;s fantastic .
i love you .
this ! i love this !
oh , my god .
this is huge .
jay , i &apos;m sorry . i need a minute .
the two guys who left the firm asked me to quit my job
and partner with them at the new agency .
big opportunity ,
big risk ,
and they need an answer by the end of the day .
i don &apos;t always make great decisions under presure .
what the hell is that ?
an alpaca . i got the last one .
come on ! move that truck !
i hate you !
okay , so ... i flirted with a table of truckers
who have offered to help us .
no ! no help ! i &apos;ve come too far !
have you ?
oh , hey ! they don &apos;t sell pizzas at this restaurant !
you parked here illegally !
congratulations , sir . you &apos;re destroying america .
hey , there are no cars behind us . go ! gun it !
all right ! all right ! everybody relax !
we &apos;re fine ! we &apos;re fine !
we are not fine !
and we &apos;re all smooshed !
and we &apos;re scared !
and we &apos;re tilted at a 30 @-@ degree angle !
nerd ! and we &apos;re dirty and tired and late !
okay ! can you please just be quiet !
why couldn &apos;t we have just asked for help ?
&apos;cause i &apos;m teaching you girls a very valuable lesson--
that gay men can do anything straight men can do .
yeah , we know that .
do you think you &apos;re the only gay guy that we know ?
yeah . my soccer coach is gay ,
our pediatrician ...
my latin tutor .
nerd ! our electrician .
well , then why were you so surprised
when i said i could drive a truck ?
not because you &apos;re gay , because you &apos;re you .
and by the way , you can &apos;t .
okay , wow . i guess i owe you an apology .
i made a leap there .
i &apos;m just used to dealing with stereotypes .
i &apos;m a little sensitive about it .
oh ! there &apos;s the trucker that i talked to .
hey ! excuse me ! hi !
could you give us a hand , please ?
sure thing , sweetie .
oh , like she &apos;ll be able to help us .
boy , do you have the right idea .
could use a little break from the mother and child reunion
going on down there .
don &apos;t ask .
mitchell &apos;s turning gloria into mom . bam ! it &apos;s out .
you remember the way mom and mitchell used to be
in their private little club ,
just the two of them , and no one else allowed in .
well ... it &apos;s happening again ,
but this time around , it &apos;s happening with your wife .
you should see them down there .
it would actually be adorable if it weren &apos;t so sick .
i just--
you know , i feel like mitchell is a grown man ,
he has a child ,
and he &apos;s still working out some psychodrama from 20 years ago .
daddy , can i have a sip of your beer , please ?
oh , my god .
mitchell cozies up to mom , i go running to daddy .
i &apos;m the one who &apos;s turning gloria into mom ,
which is really disturbing since we &apos;re the same age .
you &apos;re older .
oh . oh , that &apos;s where we &apos;re gonna chime in ?
will you hurry up ?
i &apos;m saving my strength
because if we don &apos;t find this helicopter ,
i &apos;m walking to canada .
hope you like taxes .
hey ! that &apos;s our helicopter !
is it , now ?
i &apos;m sure you have the proper documentation for that .
just give it back . it &apos;s ours .
you guys are bullies .
they can &apos;t be bullies . they &apos;re nerds .
don &apos;t pigeonhole us . we can be both .
is there an issue here ?
uncle cam , i got this .
oh , my god , it &apos;s alex dunphy .
so awesome .
problem here , boys ?
these geeks won &apos;t give us back our helicopter
that we took from reuben .
is that right , abraham ?
oh , my god . she knows your name .
helicopter , please .
i love you .
what just happened ?
you have your fans , i have mine .
some day , your fans are going to work for my fans .
oh , um , gloria ,
do you mind if i talk to mitchell alone for a minute ?
it &apos;s okay . i already know what you said ,
and i think it &apos;s crazy .
mitchell is not making me his mommy .
no , i know . he &apos;s not , but i think that i might be .
okay , now you &apos;re going really , really crazy ,
because i am younger than you .
mm , by 14 months , so let &apos;s settle down .
what is going on with you today ?
i ... all right , i &apos;m working this out as i go .
i think maybe seeing
you get all buddy @-@ buddy today with gloria
made me feel like it did
when you were with mom , and--and ...
i don &apos;t know . i @-@ i felt like the odd man out .
okay . well , that--that &apos;s how i used to feel with you and dad .
i know . i know . we--we chose teams ,
even during the divorce . it ...
okay , the last couple years ,
you and i have been our own team .
you know ? and i don &apos;t want that to go away .
so ...
i guess i just felt a little left out today .
shut up .
okay , can you two try hugging a box
so that your poor mother doesn &apos;t have to do all the hard work ?
i am sorry , gloria , about all the mom stuff today .
i just--i got this crazy idea
that you liked mitchell better than me .
i do like mitchell better than you .
what ?
ay , please .
are you going to honestly tell me
that i &apos;m your favorite person in this family ?
i &apos;m not even your favorite colombian in this family .
i would love to get closer to you .
you have my number .
but call me quickly because i book up .
you never saw me .
there you are .
i really need to talk to you .
you really don &apos;t .
jay , please . it &apos;s about work .
i got a text during your massage .
i &apos;ve been offered a partnership in a new agency .
good for you !
i &apos;m not so sure .
i mean , there &apos;s--there &apos;s a big upside ,
but i have a stable job right now .
i have three kids , and at least one of them &apos;s going to college .
worse case scenario , they all go .
well , what does claire think ?
i haven &apos;t told her yet . i wanted to talk to you first .
you &apos;ve done this .
well , i think that there &apos;s only really one question .
whether i &apos;m ready to run my own company ?
ah , you &apos;re great with people .
we know you &apos;re a good salesman .
you &apos;ve managed to provide a good living in tough times .
then what ? is this the right time ?
never a perfect time .
house could burn down tomorrow .
question is , do you want this ?
yeah .
yeah , i really want it .
then gamble on yourself .
i &apos;d gamble on you .
i &apos;m gonna do it .
there you go !
thanks , jay .
hey , look , i know you were reluctant to get that massage ,
but i think we can both agree it had a happy ending .
please don &apos;t say that .
if i could only save one possession in a fire ,
probably my first set of golf clubs .
my old man gave &apos; em to me .
the engagement ring that jay gave me
that changed my life .
lily &apos;s adoption papers .
i was gonna say adoption papers .
so i guess , then , i would say my mom &apos;s recipe book .
all our family photos ...
which i keep on my ipad , so my ipad .
as long as i have my family ,
i wouldn &apos;t need anything else .
aw , man !
what ?
you say something like that ,
it makes us all seem petty .
yeah .
well ...
i know .
hiss !
cam &apos;s sleeping . i don &apos;t wanna wake him .
he &apos;s had a rough day .
not as rough as grandpa &apos;s truck .
thank you so much for driving me .
i really didn &apos;t want to ride in that big rig .
it was amazing . everybody was honking ,
and i learned , like , five new curse words .
mostly from cam .
oh , i &apos;m glad i could give you a laugh today .
you know , i didn &apos;t know that &apos;s what i was to you people--
a big joke .
no , honey , it wasn &apos;t like that .
no , we really didn &apos;t mean-- uncle cam , we love you .
save it . i &apos;m going back to bed .
so he &apos;s still doing that ?
