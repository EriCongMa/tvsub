总监 夕橙橙
第七季 第十四集
welcome to lockhart , agos &amp; lee .
as you probably know , we are an all @-@ service law firm
with a rich tradition .
the firm was formed 12 years ago
by jonas stern and myself ,
diane lockhart .
last year , the firm reconstituted itself
with cary agos and david lee as name partners .
we occupy two floors in the dryden building--
the executive suite on the 28th floor
and the 27th floor , where support staff
and most associates work .
as a new associate , you will be given a card key
for your assigned floor ,
and you will be provided an employee handbook .
due to severe overcrowding ,
not all of you will receive an office .
some of you may have to work from cubicles for the moment .
lastly ,
lockhart , agos &amp; lee is a true meritocracy .
one of our name partners came from where you sit now
in a mere six years .
it can be done , and we expect no less of you .
so give yourself a hand .
well , look at you , big @-@ time lawyer .
well , look at you , coming back home .
yep . not much has changed .
did we make a mistake ?
i don &apos;t know . we &apos;ll see .
hey , alicia .
god . this is really weird .
i know , but not bad weird , is it ?
not yet .
well , first things first , there &apos;s no room on the 28th .
i know .
there might be soon .
but you will have the biggest office on the 27th .
hey , it &apos;s where i started out .
it &apos;s where we started out .
and i &apos;m on the 27th , too . so we can pass notes .
aw , that &apos;s nice .
eh , something from the partners .
i have to get back upstairs ,
but drop by and we &apos;ll catch a bite .
it &apos;s great to have you back .
thanks .
oh , lucca , i have to introduce you at some point to monica .
oh , we &apos;ve already met .
oh @-@ oh , right , yeah . on the other , um ,
chumhum case . well , you &apos;ll love her .
shall we drink that now ?
i &apos;d hire you .
alicia , i think i need to hire you .
do you remember me ? i &apos;m howell .
uh , yes , hello .
um , this is lucca quinn .
howell is the firm &apos;s technology director .
i @-@ i don &apos;t think i know your last name .
just howell .
anyway , i have something
seriously incredible to show you .
so , last night my girlfriend amy and i go
to the closing night of deviceroy .
device what ?
deviceroy .
it &apos;s the consumer electronics show .
like the big ces one in vegas
but without the hookers or cirque du soleil . so ,
monster after @-@ party , 15,000 people .
end of the night , amy finds something on the floor
under a table . so she gives it to me .
i wake up this morning . ooh .
i realize what it is .
what what is ?
the foil . the new chumhum tablet . their big
contribution to the gadget market . comes out in two months .
i don &apos;t understand . someone just left it there ?
yeah . so i tweeted a picture of it .
next thing i know , two different tech blogs are calling me
so they can be the first to review it .
gadgy &apos;s offering me 100 grand .
$ 100,000 ?
scoops like this
are like the pentagon papers to these sites .
they want an answer in an hour . so i need to know
if i can sell it and if you &apos;ll negotiate it for me .
i , uh ... yeah . sure .
$ 100,000 ?
lucca , uh ,
let &apos;s just take a minute on this , okay ?
just give us a minute .
this could be sticky .
one selfie . mango , carrot , ginger ,
kale , mint , apple , bee pollen .
thank you .
that &apos;s going to be disgusting , just so you know .
what is a selfie ?
it &apos;s a make @-@ your @-@ own .
you &apos;re supposed to take a picture with it
and post it online .
i know , right ?
um , and what is an &quot; arlen @-@ ergy &quot; ?
it &apos;s pronounced &quot; arlenergy . &quot;
like &quot; energy &quot; but with an &quot; arlene &quot; in front of it .
it &apos;s named after our owner .
juices are the new vanity plates .
well , what do you recommend ?
the juice bar down the street .
it &apos;s half the price .
or a nutmegan .
i &apos;ll take the &quot; arlene @-@ ergy . &quot;
&apos;cause i &apos;m a sucker for advertising .
is that why you bought that shirt , advertising ?
you don &apos;t like my shirt ?
actually , i do .
but very few girls would say that .
do you get a lunch break ?
it &apos;s not europe , so i only get an hour .
so good to have you back .
thank you .
home is where they take you in , right ?
happily take you in .
um , and you know lucca .
yes .
early this morning . i have to introduce you to monica .
i think you &apos;ll like each other .
we were across the table from each other ,
on the chummy maps case .
oh . right .
so , uh , you haven &apos;t even sat down yet and you have something ?
yes . howell .
our i.t. guy .
right . uh , cary briefed me .
how is this tablet not considered stolen property ?
it was abandoned . it &apos;s more accurately defined
as lost property .
uh , by law , howell has
to give the owner a chance to recover .
he has to at least attempt constructive notice .
not by law .
lucca , can you give us a minute ?
we can &apos;t be a part of this .
she &apos;s right on the law .
and how it &apos;s enforced .
we can &apos;t risk a lawsuit from chumhum over a casual favor
to an employee .
just to confirm , this call is being recorded
for quality and training purposes ?
yes , it is , ma &apos;am .
how may i help you ?
what is this ?
chumhum customer service .
how may i help you ?
hi . uh , i have in my possession
a prototype of the new foil tablet .
i &apos;m sorry ... excuse me ?
the foil tablet .
i have it .
that &apos;s not possible , ma &apos;am .
it is , because i have it .
the foil will be released
in time for back @-@ to @-@ school sales .
would you like me to give you the web address ?
no . uh , could i speak to a supervisor ?
i am a supervisor .
ah . so you have authority to answer my questions ?
that &apos;s correct .
then could you advise me on the best way to return
the tablet to the company ?
it &apos;s not the foil , ma &apos;am .
the foil will be released in time for back @-@ to @-@ school sales .
so i can keep it ?
whatever you have , you can keep .
shall i direct you to the web site ?
constructive notice given
and rejected .
howell is now firmly in the &quot; finders keepers &quot; territory ,
and we can help him sell it .
why don &apos;t you give us a minute .
so this is bureaucracy .
the israeli army ? really ?
yeah . but it &apos;s not like i shot anyone .
one time i did this great thing along the egyptian border .
they have these five @-@ women sharpshooter teams
camouflaged in the desert .
you stay all night in a pod
about the size of these two tables .
five women , all night ,
and all you can do is whisper .
it &apos;s really terrifying but really cool .
did you see any terrorists ?
no . bedouin nomads , mostly .
now i &apos;m here in this stupid juice bar 3,000 miles away .
it &apos;s 11 : 00 p.m. in israel
and my friends are slipping into their desert pods right now
and i &apos;m ... here talking to you .
weird .
yeah .
were your parents afraid of you being over there ?
of getting stabbed , no .
of turning orthodox , yes .
actually , just my mom was . she &apos;s the worrywart .
my dad was too busy to notice i was gone .
mmm . why ?
what does he do ?
you know governor peter florrick ?
sure .
he &apos;s his chief of staff .
or ...
was . then wasn &apos;t .
now is again , i think .
i know .
he also ran peter &apos;s campaign for president .
so he must have every
rich person in illinois knocking down his door .
he &apos;s the door .
although i was alicia florrick &apos;s
body woman for her campaign for state &apos;s attorney ,
which he also ran .
and alicia florrick ?
what was it like working for her ?
you are a curious one , aren &apos;t you ?
no . i just ... i don &apos;t meet too many , you know , like ,
malcolm gladwell connector types .
so , tell me about you . what do you do ?
i &apos;m a student . nothing exciting .
nothing like dealing with a lot of campaign money .
yeah , i know . what do you study ?
computers . programming .
really ? tell me more .
dad .
i &apos;m busy , marissa .
a young man asked me to lunch today .
congratulations .
let me know when i have to spring for a wedding .
his name was scott devereaux ,
and he had a lot of questions about you .
i don &apos;t know him .
questions like
who you have dinner with , who gives money to the campaign ,
how often you talk with alicia .
what is this again ?
a young man took me to lunch but had much more interest
in you than in me .
he said he was a student .
what &apos;s he look like ?
oddly enough , i convinced him to take a selfie .
i trained you well .
oh , my god . he &apos;s an fbi agent .
what &apos;s his name ?
scott devereaux .
no , no , no .
hlavin .
roland hlavin . what did he ask ?
did he mention a judge ? schakowsky ?
no . why ?
what did he ask ?
... malcolm gladwell connector types .
so , tell me about you . what do you do ?
you recorded it .
i &apos;m a student .
i did .
nothing exciting . nothing like dealing with a lot of campaign money .
yeah , i know ...
what ?
it &apos;s just ... now i get why people have children .
they can admire themselves in someone else .
hi .
ma &apos;am .
how do you like my office ?
it &apos;s got a view .
what do you think ?
look at my chair .
i like it . it fits you .
off @-@ center ?
tilted .
how do you keep your beard that length ?
i mean , at a certain point , you &apos;re either clean @-@ shaven
or you &apos;re abraham lincoln , right ?
no .
it stays like this . since birth .
we kissed .
i know .
so what do we do now ?
i don &apos;t know . i &apos;m not big on planning .
do you think it will be weird for us--
working in a corporate setting ?
well ,
i &apos;m freelance .
you are .
you &apos;re freelance .
okay . you know , they probably
want me to work .
so good seeing you , workmate .
you too .
凯里 · 艾格斯
oh , come on .
seriously , you &apos;re dropping it ?
it makes us nervous .
howell &apos;s an employee .
he needs your help .
yes , but we are in a weird place with chumhum .
we don &apos;t really want to poke the bear .
wow , things have really changed around here .
what &apos;s that ?
you &apos;re back home .
it &apos;s always exciting here .
hello , my name &apos;s perry dunst .
i &apos;m with the taps unit .
what unit ?
we have a warrant for the arrest of drummond howell .
on what charges ?
trafficking in stolen property .
that &apos;s him right there ,
gray sweater . go ahead and cuff him .
what is taps ?
mr. howell , please get on your knees ,
put your hands behind your head .
what the hell &apos;s going on ?
howell , don &apos;t say anything .
we &apos;re mr. howell &apos;s lawyers . may i see that warrant ?
ma &apos;am , please stay back .
howell , stay calm .
we will take care of this .
who are those guys ?
three years ?
i didn &apos;t sell anyone this prototype .
did you speak to anyone besides us about the possibility of selling ?
just amy ,
my girlfriend . you got to keep her out of this .
we will . just remember , whatever these agents ask ,
we do the talking .
i thought you weren &apos;t representing me .
we weren &apos;t .
now it &apos;s the firm .
hello .
mr. gross .
ah , it &apos;s the law firm that &apos;s
the perpetual stone in my shoe .
so , uh , you seem to have something of mine .
sir , i think we should handle this through lawyers .
i &apos;ve spoken to agent dunst ,
he &apos;s agreed to drop the charges-- lucky you-- if you
return my prototype , and if you give me
the name of the person who gave it to you .
why do you need the name ?
mrs. florrick .
i &apos;m sorry about your husband &apos;s loss .
thank you . why do you need the name ?
chumhum &apos;s suffered an unprecedented security breach .
i need to know exactly what went wrong
so i can make sure it never happens again .
howell won &apos;t give up his girlfriend .
even if it means going to jail for three years ?
yes .
why are they allowing neil gross into an interrogation room ?
i don &apos;t know .
and why is he the one making the offer ?
have you ever heard of taps before ?
never .
so what &apos;s going on here ?
hello , don .
what the hell are you doing here , eli ?
i just need a minute .
you wearing a wire ?
no . are you ?
why would i be ?
is that a yes or a no ?
it &apos;s a no , eli .
i wasn &apos;t expecting to see you in my chambers .
i come bearing bad news .
of course you do .
i think the fbi is investigating
our ... business last year .
they &apos;re certainly investigating something .
they were here ?
roland hlavin .
that little smartass .
what was he asking ?
he was asking about alicia florrick .
alicia ?
taps-- technology allied protection service .
what is that ?
it is a multi @-@ agency task force
that works with silicon valley &apos;s biggest companies
to clamp down on technology theft .
the ipolice ?
yeah .
there is such a thing ?
oh , yeah . and you want to know something interesting ?
more interesting than the ipolice ?
lead agent over there , dunst .
he &apos;s based in san francisco .
the prototype was reported missing at 2 : 30 a.m.
and yet here he is , in chicago , bright and early .
how &apos;d he get here so fast ?
neil gross &apos; private plane .
that is interesting .
diane needs you back at the office .
why ?
i don &apos;t know . go , i &apos;ve got this .
all rise
for the honorable judge hal ferris .
angry faces .
looks like fun .
fire away .
your honor ,
my client was arrested on the flimsiest of pretenses .
wait a minute .
there &apos;s a trail of ants here , harris .
have you been eating sandwiches on my bench again ?
no , your honor .
can we do something about this ?
i &apos;ll get right on it .
good .
okay , uh , i &apos;ll stand for this one .
i &apos;m a little grossed out .
and i can &apos;t wait to hear more , counselor .
yes , your honor .
we request that the u.s. attorney show ...
your honor ?
yes , i can listen to you
and watch ants at the same time .
we request that the ausa
show probable cause or release him .
well , let &apos;s get to it , then .
mr. gross contacted us at 2 : 35 a.m.
we then interviewed blake reedy ,
the engineer who was carrying the prototype .
mr. reedy stated that the device had been stolen
from his backpack at the deviceroy after @-@ party .
we took it from there .
there were over 15,000 people at the party .
how did you locate mr. howell ?
we worked the guest list ,
cross @-@ referenced it with known offenders .
we identified mr. howell , then tracked down his tweet
with his pictures of the foil .
thanks , this is perfect .
the foil is the stolen tablet , your honor .
the known offenders list-- why was mr. howell on it ?
well , he &apos;s something of a low @-@ level hacker .
low @-@ level ? i &apos;m not low @-@ level .
fanboy stuff , mostly .
unveiling new game specs before they &apos;re released .
but he &apos;s also been suspected of hacking law enforcement databases .
objection , no foundation .
withdrawn .
no more questions .
okay , next .
um , agent dunst ,
you &apos;re technically with the fbi
but also serve on taps--
the technology allied protection service task force ,
is that correct ?
it is ,
although i would not call myself technically with the fbi .
does the fbi have a steering committee , sir ?
a ...
steering committee .
no .
does the secret service or the chicago pd ?
not that i know of .
how about taps ?
does they have a steering committee ?
yes , they do .
and , um , who serves on this committee ?
law enforcement . experts in their fields .
and ...
i &apos;m not sure what you want me to say .
ceos of silicon valley &apos;s 14 biggest companies--
don &apos;t they serve on the steering committee too ?
that &apos;s right .
including neil gross ?
objection . relevance .
i am just trying to identify
who agent dunst reports to .
your honor , the taps steering committee
coordinates the protection of the country &apos;s technology ,
which is a national security issue .
and you know how much i love my national security secure .
i &apos;m guessing that the answer to mrs. florrick &apos;s question is ,
&quot; yes , i do report to neil gross . &quot;
that is correct .
well , then i &apos;ve heard the answer .
overruled .
did taps receive a grant from chumhum ?
objection .
did your unit receive a grant from chumhum , agent ?
yes , your honor .
so now i &apos;ve heard that answer too .
overruled .
agent dunst , isn &apos;t it true that last year alone ,
four agents from taps left for senior jobs
at chumhum &apos;s security department ?
objection . these questions are irrelevant .
were there grounds to arrest the defendant ?
that &apos;s the only question that matters here .
this is a massive conflict of interest , your honor .
taps is effectively acting
as mr. gross &apos; personal security force .
taps is a legitimate law enforcement organization .
issues of conflict of interest
are more appropriate for trial , counselor .
so for the moment the only question is :
is there enough evidence to hold your client ?
oh , good , uh , lucca , we need you on the dipple filing .
oh , i &apos;m in the midst of the howell defense .
i thought that was alicia .
it is .
but it &apos;s @-@ it &apos;s me too .
actually , we would rather have you on the dipple filing ,
if that &apos;s all right . you can work with monica .
you &apos;ll love working with her . she &apos;s fantastic .
monica ...
do you remember lucca ?
yes . from the safe filter suit .
well , now you &apos;re on the same side .
yes , now we are .
can you show lucca what we &apos;re doing ?
sure can .
so ... i &apos;m supposed to really like you .
yes , let &apos;s share about our common experiences .
blake reedy ,
design engineer on the foil development team .
i designed the home button ...
with mr. gross &apos; input , of course .
and you brought the prototype with you to the deviceroy conference ?
yeah . i &apos;d work on it during breaks .
and how can you be sure
you didn &apos;t lose it during one of those breaks ?
my backpack has a power plug .
when i &apos;m not working on the device ,
it &apos;s always plugged in there , charging .
and did you take the tablet out during the after @-@ party ?
no , it was in my bag the whole time .
but i remember that guy
bumping into me by the martini bar .
mr. howell , the defendant ?
yeah .
and when i got back to my hotel room 20 minutes later ,
i saw the foil was gone .
thank you .
uh , so you never took the device out of your backpack ?
i was like a secret service guy carrying the football .
um , this is from the comments section
of the tech blog gadgy .
uh , a woman named candycane posted
about a &quot; geek @-@ hot engineer &quot; who showed her
the foil prototype at the deviceroy party .
was there another geek @-@ hot engineer with the prototype ?
objection .
sustained . harris , where are we with the bug spray ?
working on it , your honor .
did you not show this woman the foil to impress her ?
i @-@ i didn &apos;t let her touch it or anything .
but isn &apos;t it possible that you got distracted
and just left it ?
objection .
asked and answered .
sure . sustained .
could you read this text
which is from your ... coworker ?
how did you ... how did you get this ?
from your coworker .
objection , your honor . what is this document ?
uh , well , from what the counselor just told us
it seems to be a text message .
and from all appearances , your witness recognizes it .
so what is the objection ?
foundation .
sure . that &apos;s an objection .
overruled .
could you read the text message ?
um , &quot; my bad . gotta tell ng .
ng will kill me . &quot;
ng being neil gross ?
yeah .
didn &apos;t you fabricate the whole theft story
because you were afraid ng might kill you ?
no .
then what does that text refer to ?
it being stolen .
so why is it &quot; your bad &quot; if it was stolen ?
i don &apos;t know . because i was being inexact in my language ?
okay .
when taps questioned you , did mr. gross
instruct them what to ask you ?
objection . we &apos;ve been over this .
yup . yeah , you lost this one earlier , mrs. florrick .
sustained .
nothing further .
i &apos;m losing , aren &apos;t i ?
we have to shift gears .
the hard core has protein , almonds ,
turbinado and one hell of an ice cream headache .
marissa !
dad .
i need you now !
i &apos;ll be right back .
what the hell ?
did the fed ask you any questions about alicia ?
no . i mentioned her , and he asked what she was like ,
but i didn &apos;t say anything .
he called again and asked me out .
who , hlavin ?
yeah . just a few hours ago .
i was thinking &quot; no , &quot; but maybe i should say &quot; yes . &quot;
is he after alicia ?
i don &apos;t know .
do you want me to find out ?
you &apos;ll be careful ?
always .
eli .
so the 27th floor again .
everything comes full circle , doesn &apos;t it ?
yes .
first the tragedy , and then the farce .
you need something ?
we &apos;re good , yes ?
we &apos;re good .
i think feds are investigating you .
and your chair is tilted .
they &apos;re investigating me for what ?
i don &apos;t know . i &apos;m trying to find out .
it could be the judge schakowsky bribe .
i had nothing to do with that .
or the electoral board vote .
i need you to call me if roland hlavin comes by .
him ?
he approached marissa .
oh , god . it never ends .
neil gross is a fascist .
and fascists must not be allowed to terrorize .
mr. dudewitz , hello .
hello , lawyer ,
other lawyer .
i &apos;m not a lawyer .
do i care ?
i am here , as requested , to stand up to the bully .
i &apos;ll be in touch .
yup .
here &apos;s the howell file , alicia .
where are you going ?
me ? upstairs , on another case .
what other case ? there &apos;s no other case .
i &apos;m here . this is the case .
diane has me on dipple .
stay . i &apos;ll talk to diane .
great . now what do you want ?
we want what you know about the foil .
it &apos;s a marketing stunt .
what part of it , mr. dudewitz ?
all of it . the lost device , the arrest of that guy there .
the ... the ... aren &apos;t you supposed to be sitting up there ?
yes , but it &apos;s opposite day .
see ? no gavel , either .
uh , please continue , mr. dudewitz .
what &apos;s your name again ?
lucca .
i love that name .
how &apos;d you get that name ?
objection , your honor .
relevance .
i know , but yet , i &apos;m ... i &apos;m curious , too .
uh , you may answer .
my parents traveled a lot .
i was this close to being called &quot; budapest . &quot;
budapest . that &apos;s funny . what was the question again ?
you were saying , um , this is a marketing stunt .
yes . the lost foil , this proceeding .
it &apos;s a piece of theatre .
no , it &apos;s a piece of tragic @-@ comedy conjured up by neil gross ,
the great carnival barker of our time .
objection . relevance .
your honor , if this is indeed a marketing stunt ,
then there is no crime ,
which would mean no probable cause .
i &apos;ll hear it out . overruled .
what specifically
makes you think this is a marketing stunt ?
we talked about the same thing with our first product launch .
mr. gross-- and i use &quot; mister &quot; guardedly--
he &apos;s about to launch his first foray
into personal computing devices
where products die bloody , violent deaths .
he &apos;s invested $ 800 million .
why would he let a prototype off his premises ?
so chumhum &apos;s security lapse was intended ?
objection . speculation .
let me hear a bit more , then i &apos;ll rule .
chumhum &apos;s security is legendary .
that compound is more fortified than a missile silo in kansas .
so why leak the prototype ?
the foil &apos;s a great product . kudos , neil .
at least you have the smarts to hire people smarter than you ,
which actually isn &apos;t that difficult .
anthony ...
it &apos;s the umpteenth tablet in the market .
it has a closed operating system .
nobody &apos;s building apps for it .
bottom line : nobody cares .
so the arrest of mr. howell
boosts its profile by generating publicity ?
it does . neil gross is a jackass ,
but he &apos;s no dummy .
thank you , mr. dudewitz .
anytime . for you .
now i have to deal with mediocrity , yes ? this lady .
just a few questions , mr. dudewitz .
sure . i can &apos;t wait .
how do you beat the retina scan at chumhum &apos;s labs ?
i have no idea .
that &apos;s because there is no retina scan at chumhum .
ah , you got me . i &apos;m red @-@ faced .
you have no idea of the security measures at chumhum , do you ?
i don &apos;t . i &apos;m as innocent as a suckling babe .
you and mr. gross
started out together at freemont labs , correct ?
yes , that &apos;s where neil tried to write code ...
with his own feces .
and you still subscribe to the research labs &apos; philosophy
that technology should be shared
and not sold for profit , correct ?
you told her to go down that road , neil ?
mr. dudewitz ...
did you also tell her about how you created the code for chumhum
after our visit to the freemont research labs ?
perhaps we can get that in the record .
mr. dudewitz ,
you are to answer the attorney &apos;s questions .
do not address anyone else in the court .
withdrawn , your honor .
no further questions .
excuse me ?
we &apos;re done here . no further questions .
what just happened ?
i think we just landed a sucker punch .
hello ?
who have you been talking to , eli gold ?
ruth .
i thought you &apos;d been sucked up
into all those snow belt governors &apos; races .
i &apos;ve kept busy .
so , to what do i owe this honor ?
oh , not so much an honor as a bad feeling .
where &apos;d you get that painting ?
courtney paige .
it makes me nervous . all those people staring ,
like they want something .
i think it &apos;s about revolution .
are you sure ? they seem to be singing .
and those trees .
well , you know . art .
are you out to get me , eli ?
am i ... out to get you ?
no . why ? should i be ?
you seem to have waited until i was good and gone
to get a little revenge .
what are you babbling about ?
grand jury subpoena ... from the fbi .
well , i &apos;m sure it &apos;s just a standard post @-@ campaign wind @-@ down .
you know , checking we dotted our i &apos;s and crossed our t &apos;s .
i &apos;ve done that drill more than once ,
and it does not include an fbi interrogation .
well , my advice is , don &apos;t make too much of it .
eli , if you &apos;re setting me up here ,
i will take your skinny little head ...
i am not setting you up .
and i give you my word :
if i get even an inkling that you are in jeopardy ,
i will let you know .
we may be mercenaries , but ...
even mercenaries have a code .
when this thing &apos;s over ...
it &apos;s over .
i promise .
you do realize your timing chronically sucks .
i need you to do something for me .
now ? the store is packed .
well , tell them to buy juice at 7 @-@ 11 like normal people !
i need you to call your friend roland or scott ,
or whatever his name is .
what ? why ?
i need you to set up another date .
hey , where &apos;s lucca ?
i don &apos;t know .
wasn &apos;t she here helping you ?
i think they needed her on another case .
here she is .
oh , lu ... what ?
no , right there ...
excuse me . what &apos;s going on ?
we have a warrant authorizing the search of these premises
for the missing foil prototype .
ah , wait . hold on . we &apos;re mr. howell &apos;s attorneys .
anything you find here is work product ,
and , therefore , privileged .
this also happens to be howell &apos;s place of work ,
so , yes , we &apos;re authorized .
mr. howell &apos;s cubicle is downstairs .
your search will be confined to his work space
and will be supervised by one of us .
no ma &apos;am . as it specialist ,
he has access to every cubicle and office on the premises ,
so we &apos;ll search where we like . excuse me .
they won &apos;t find anything .
how can you be sure ?
because i have it .
you were told multiple times the firm
would have nothing to do with this device .
i didn &apos;t take it to help broker a sale .
it all happened in the moment .
when they arrested him ,
howell panicked and stashed it in my cubicle .
they &apos;re losing the probable cause hearing .
this is their pushback .
we should give them their device .
we can &apos;t do that . it &apos;s bound up in attorney @-@ client privilege .
we should talk .
alicia , do you have a minute ?
so , we have to find a working rhythm here again .
i know . the howell case got a bit out of hand .
no , it &apos;s bigger than that .
okay .
when cary suggested
that you come back , i wasn &apos;t against it ,
but i was afraid that there might be a few bumps .
which bumps might those be ?
a certain independence
and a resistance to oversight .
okay .
tell me how you would like me to improve .
lucca isn &apos;t your associate .
she is the firm &apos;s associate .
i understand .
she caught the howell case with me , so i thought
the associate that caught the case stays with the case .
sometimes .
if the partners agree .
i see . i &apos;m sorry .
i should have checked with you first . anything else ?
lucca needs to know that she is answerable to the firm ,
and not just to you .
and that &apos;s why you have her on the dipple case ?
no . i have her on the dipple case
because we needed an associate on the dipple case .
diane ,
i &apos;m thrilled to be back .
i want to be of service .
but i also return with some cases ,
clients and knowledge .
you mean , in bond court ?
yes ,
i do mean in bond court .
lucca is good .
she &apos;s smart and forward @-@ leaning
and a prodigy .
and with respect ,
she shouldn &apos;t be given grunt work .
your advice is welcome .
the partners will consider it .
thank you .
anything else ?
no , you can go .
hypothetical , mr. gross .
suppose i knew where the foil prototype was .
melodramatic opening ,
but i &apos;m listening .
if i could convince my client to return it ,
would you convince taps to drop the charges ?
i would on the condition
that he also tell me exactly how he got it .
no .
then we have nothing to hypothetically negotiate .
dudewitz is right about you .
you think you &apos;re so indispensable
to the fabric of modern society
that you &apos;ve even bought your own a police force
to do your dirty work under color of law .
goliath stomping david , right ?
you know what these taps agents are , mrs. florrick ?
they are heroes .
really ?
and why is that , mr. gross ?
because the goliaths are the new davids .
the model of scruffy kids toiling in a garage
is a quaint anachronism .
this isn &apos;t 1953 , 1973
or even 2003 .
the great innovations today
are coming out of corporate labs , not garages .
everyone thinks goliath is the villain ,
but the truth is that today ,
more often than not , he is a victim .
and he needs protection .
objection . relevance , not to mention self @-@ aggrandizing .
let &apos;s get back to probable cause , ms. gades .
uh , harris ...
they &apos;re back .
i have another call in , your honor .
well , they seem to be getting bigger .
your honor , may i continue ?
go for it .
was the leak of the foil
a marketing stunt , as anthony dudewitz alleges ?
hmm . anthony &apos;s currency is , um , conspiracy theories .
they make for fun segments on discovery channel ,
but they don &apos;t comport with reality .
no . no , this was not a marketing stunt .
but this incident has garnered
publicity for the foil , has it not ?
i can generate publicity
in a million different ways .
i &apos;m a carnival barker , remember ?
no , i would never leak the foil
for one simple reason :
i don &apos;t launch defective products .
what is he talking about ?
i don &apos;t know .
are you saying the product is defective ?
yes , in its current state .
the ... the swipe function has a rebound effect .
it &apos;s barely visible , but it &apos;s enough to keep me up at night .
and even anthony dudewitz can tell you ,
i would never use a stunt to leak a product
that is not perfect .
thank you , sir .
mr. gross ...
that &apos;s okay , mrs. florrick .
i &apos;ve heard enough .
what ? i &apos;d like to cross .
mr. gross has convinced me
that this wasn &apos;t a marketing stunt .
uh , there .
i saved you your cross .
your honor ...
this is a preliminary hearing , mrs. florrick ,
not a trial .
you can revisit it then
if you can &apos;t come up with something better .
i &apos;m entering a finding of probable cause .
we &apos;ll set trial for six months from now .
you &apos;re wasting your time with ruth eastman .
am i now ?
i &apos;ve worked with dozens of political operatives ,
and ruth is as upstanding as they come .
i &apos;m surprised .
that ruth &apos;s legit ?
no . that you &apos;d defend her
after she pushed you out of governor florrick &apos;s campaign .
well , you know .
bygones .
hmm . from what i heard , that wound up putting you
on the outs with the entire florrick family .
what do you want to know ,
agent hlavin or devereaux ? hmm ?
instead of poking around with ruth eastman and god knows who else ,
why don &apos;t you just ask me ?
what do you want ?
you &apos;ll find out soon enough .
there &apos;s a limit to how long you can play this game
before investigation turns into intimidation .
are you threatening me ?
no , never .
just observing .
be careful , eli .
i have the full resources of the fbi
and the justice department behind me on this ,
and we always get what we &apos;re after .
i heard about the hearing . i &apos;m sorry .
yeah , looks like we &apos;re headed towards a summer trial .
well , on the upside , howell can at least make bail .
he doesn &apos;t have $ 250,000 .
he will now .
that tech blog site , gadgy ,
just upped their bid to $ 250,000 .
alicia ?
please tell me you haven &apos;t been negotiating with gadgy .
i &apos;m sorry , i haven &apos;t what ?
gadgy just offered howell $ 250,000,
which means someone has been talking to them ,
and it sure as hell couldn &apos;t have been him .
and you think it was me ?
well , you &apos;ve been hell @-@ bent on proving cary and diane wrong .
you can &apos;t dig in on principle at a firm like this .
i know that coming here wasn &apos;t your first choice--
believe me , it wasn &apos;t mine--
but our hand was forced .
i think i found your guilty party .
or more accurately ,
419,000 guilty parties .
wait a minute .
with all those followers ,
i think there &apos;s another way to go .
it &apos;s peter .
you sure ?
they don &apos;t bring the full resources of the fbi
and the justice department against just anyone .
they &apos;re trying to bring down another governor .
which issue specifically ?
i don &apos;t know .
you know what it &apos;s like .
the longer you &apos;re in office , the more things there are
that are papered over , put away , massaged .
yes , but in my experience ,
if you think back through all of the issues
and figure which one you never kept a file on ,
never took a note about , never admitted to anyone ...
that &apos;s the one .
you know ...
you were right .
&apos;bout what ?
returning home after losing a presidential bid ,
peter had a target on his back ...
... and someone &apos;s going to take a shot at him .
every time .
good luck , eli .
all rise !
so christo seems to have been at work here .
no .
pete from maintenance .
so he didn &apos;t want to tent me , too ?
no . he thinks this will do it .
great .
well .
it &apos;s a real improvement here .
so , we seem to have a new defense here we &apos;re trying , counselor ?
well , not new .
but true .
mr. howell is a journalist .
really ? !
when did this happen ?
a citizen journalist .
mr. howell is therefore entitled to protect the identity
of the person from whom he obtained the foil
and to do as he pleases with the device .
mr. howell is not a journalist .
he &apos;s a look @-@ at @-@ me with a smartphone .
his tweet about the foil
falls within the definition of journalism .
he shared information in a public forum ,
information he analyzed ...
with five exclamation points ?
that does not qualify as analysis .
and his post sparked public debate
about whether the foil would succeed or fail .
this so @-@ called debate includes an emoji of a flaming poop .
well , it &apos;s not as though he tweeted a picture of his johnson , ms. gades .
there &apos;s public interest in the foil ,
and his tweets added to the public discourse ,
uh , flaming poops notwithstanding .
this court therefore considers the defendant ...
a journalist .
go free and go crazy , mr. howell .
the journalism angle you came up with was a home run .
nice job .
thank you .
now i need you on something else .
what ?
so here we are .
yep .
do you know any spirituals ?
ruth ?
what a nice surprise .
i was in town , figured i &apos;d bring you a little office @-@ warming present .
el audaz .
it means &quot; the bold . &quot;
that strong , huh ?
you &apos;ll see .
well , there is no time like the present .
rough day ?
it was a bumpy reentry .
yes , i was surprised .
i thought you reveled in your independence .
big decisions are easy when you have no other options .
oh , you weren &apos;t kidding .
never about tequila .
so , what are you up to now ?
couple governor races .
but coming off a presidential , these statewides seem so simple .
i bet .
mrs. florrick , i don &apos;t want you to get too comfortable .
you ... what do you mean ?
your husband has a target on his back .
well , anyone in public life does .
no , but not like this .
no question peter loves you ,
but he can hurt you .
drag you down .
not only destroy everything you &apos;ve done ,
but everything you want to do .
cash out while you still can .
