Wait minute. I want to confirm this before we can report it.
Okay, WBBM can now project that
Peter Florrick is the next State's Attorney of Cook County.
It's always best to know the truth,
no matter how much it hurts.
Do you believe that?
Yes.
It was a rumor your husband
slept with one of his coworkers two years ago.
There was no one in the department with that name.
Leela.
But she doesn't exit.
Unless you've heard of her.
Have you heard of her? Leela?
Let me introduce you to Cook County's
new State's Attorney, Peter Florrick!
Thanks for coming out so late.
No problem.
Don't worry.
Real estate is a 24-hour a day job.
Congratulations, Mrs. State's Attorney.
Thank you.
So this is available now?
It is. Two bedrooms, two bath.
Furnished. $2,800 a month.
But to be honest, if you gave me some time
I could probably get that down.
No.
That's fine. Thank you.
It has a view.
Most importantly,
it's right around the corner from the courthouse.
Do you have the lease?
Wow. When you decide, you really decide.
Ten minutes ago, I received
a very gracious concession call from Wendy Scott-Carr.
That was Peter Florrick speaking
to his supporters a few minutes ago.
And now I've got his mother, Mrs. Jackie Florrick.
Well, you must be a very proud mother tonight.
Oh, Rob, you can't...
Hey, babe, where are you?
I found a place.
What?!
Like a house?
An apartment.
Come look.
What...? You there now?
Yes. The kids are staying with Jackie tonight.
Okay. Well, look, can you give me about an hour?
Things are starting to wind down here.
Sure.
1601 North State, Apartment 908.
Okay, see you there.
我们非常遗憾地通知您...
You are so funny.
You got it already?
Is it big enough?
This is your apartment, Peter.
I've moved all your things here.
What?
You'll have to use your cell phone for a while
until they can get the phones connected,
and I've paid your first three months rent.
I don't get this.
You slept with Kalinda.
Look...
No, don't...
Peter.
This makes it easier.
So please just take your keys.
Alicia, I need you.
You slept with my best friend.
It was before she was your best friend.
Oh, God.
Look, I'm not trying to make excuses,
but you know I've changed.
I love you.
Look, what can I do to make this better.
Nothing.
*I thought I was a victim*
*That people hated me*
*I never had a homeland*
*I had no safety Huh, yah*
*Let it go, let it go*
*Turn on the light, y'all *
*I love the beast, y'all *
*Let it go, let it go*
*Turn on the light, y'all*
*Then take your pills*
*I love the beast, y'all*
Excuse me, Your Honor, do I really have to say?
You do if you want me to rule, Miss Nyholm.
Lockhart&Gardner has gotten in the nasty little habit
of pushing legal agenda through emergency injunction.
You can't decide something that hasn't happened, Your Honor.
And, as my opposing counsel well knows,
there is no liver available yet, so there is nothing to enjoin...
Yes, but as Miss Nyholm well knows,
when the donor's liver does become available...
I'm sorry, I wasn't finished yet.
...there will only be a 12-hour window of viability
and that is what Miss Nyholm is counting on.
You have no idea what I'm counting on.
She is counting on that liver
being transplanted into another patient.
And at that point, there truly will be nothing to enjoin.
Okay. Can I have my turn now?
Yes, Your Honor.
I wish Mrs. Florrick didn't think
she was arguing before the Supreme Court.
And I wish Miss Nyholm did.
Miss Nyholm, this 12-hour window of viability
offers insufficient time for an emergency injunction,
so your objection is overruled.
Continue.
So, Marjorie,
when did your liver start to fail?
Two years ago.
And what happened a week ago?
There was a match for my liver.
A young man had been in a motorcycle accident
and was brain dead.
My name was at the top of the ORSN list.
I know I sound like an expert on this stuff,
but you get informed really fast when you're this sick.
So you were told
that this donor's liver was intended for you?
Yes.
You can't believe how happy we were.
My s... son... oh...
I'm sorry.
He's five.
I haven't told him that there's a... a problem yet.
What is that problem?
I don't know.
All I know is, my name was removed
from the ORSN list.
And what has the doctor told you will happen next?
Well... without this liver,
they say I have...
three weeks.
We need to know how long the donor has.
Got it.
How's Alicia doing?
She's got Patti on her heels.
The motorcycle accident severed his brain stem.
Is he in pain?
No, he's not.
It's just that there are people at this hospital
who could benefit... from this terrible tragedy.
We know, Doctor?
But we need to wait.
I'm so sorry.
My other son-- We're sending for him.
That's okay.
You know, if you need anything...
Thank you. Mm-hmm.
Hey, guys, all that stuff's coming in here.
What's going on over there?
I don't know.
We're making space.
They won't allow their son to be unplugged
until his brother comes from Afghanistan to see him.
I know I sound like a ghoul even asking this, but how long?
They're putting him on a transport tomorrow.
They think three days.
Objection!
Asked and answered.
Sustained.
Well, let me see if I ask this to Mrs. Florrick's satisfaction.
What did your specialist, Dr. Lawton,
tell you exactly was the reason
why you were removed from the liver contention?
He said my liver failure was so far advanced
that a new liver would only be counterproductive.
And you might only live another six months with the liver?
Yes, but he wasn't sure.
I understand that.
And I'm sorry to ask you this, Marjorie.
There are only so many viable livers available for transplant.
Wouldn't it be better to see it transplanted into someone
who has a better chance of survival?
I spent some time in a hospital over the last two years,
and I know doctors speak of
objective and subjective medical criteria.
Dr. Lawton's opinion was subjective medical criteria.
No further questions, Your Honor.
We ask that we take a recess for the afternoon.
Objection. Again, Your Honor, delaying tactics.
One of Mrs. Florrick's key witnesses,
Mr. Haynes from hospital administration,
has been called away on an emergency.
He's not available.
Your Honor, this is a shell game.
We'll break for lunch.
Miss Nyholm, you have two hours
to produce this witness or show cause.
Thank you.
It's my job.
No. You're not like before.
You're fighting for me.
Change of plan. I want you
to take the questioning of the hospital administrator.
I think you're getting under Patti's skin, so keep it up.
Hello.
Phone your boyfriend.
Tell him I need to ask him something.
My boyfriend?
Will Gardner. Tell him I want to see him
in 30 minutes or I'm on to the next.
What?
It's good to see you.
And you.
You've been working out.
How's the kid?
Good, thanks.
I've been fired.
You've been fired?
By whom?
My firm. My law firm.
The law firm I spilled blood for.
They fired me just this afternoon.
A senior partner informed me.
And are you looking for a new job?
I'm looking to sue.
$8.6 million.
They fired me because I'm pregnant.
Really?
You're pregnant?
I am. It happens.
Are you thinking of populating a small island?
You have five minutes,
then I go to Quinn & Holland.
I think they're still in the building.
So you go from fighting with us in the morning
to hiring us in the afternoon?
Yes.
Why do you find that so confusing, Mrs. Florrick?
Will doesn't find that confusing, do you?
You're using our suit, our donor suit
to get your firm to pay up?
That is so adorably calculated.
Maybe I just think you're good lawyers.
You have four minutes.
How did it go today?
Judge Parks likes us.
We have three days until the liver's available.
Yes, but you don't know what my firm has coming down the pike.
Which you can't tell us or you will get disbarred.
True, but I'm human...
and pregnant.
And who knows what a pregnant woman in my state might say.
Give me a taste.
We know you're using this
donor suit as a stalking horse
for a multimillion dollar malpractice
class action against Harbor Hospital.
The hospital administrator-- he's not out on an emergency.
You wanted to question him, didn't you, Mrs. Florrick?
You have three minutes.
Do you want my case or not?
They didn't really fire you because you were pregnant.
Of course they did.
But it makes a good story anyway.
Then let's sue.
Hello, Alicia.
Hello, Jackie.
May I sit?
You may.
But in 15 minutes I have to be in court.
Why did you do it?
You're in my office, Jackie.
You've come here for a specific reason.
I won't be put in a position of guessing.
You broke up with my son.
I dropped your children off,
and found Peter not there.
He was in an apartment you moved him into.
Yes.
So you waited until he was elected,
then you made your move.
What move do you imagine that might be, Jackie?
I have no idea.
I am not in your head.
Your children were looking for their father.
My children are in school,
and I intend to see them afterwards
and explain this to them.
And poison them with your bias?
Be cordial here, Jackie, or I will ask you to leave.
You and I have had our differences, Alicia,
but I've come to respect you,
and-and admire aspects of you.
But my son is hurting,
and I... I cannot see him... hurt
on the day he should be happiest,
I have never seen him so destroyed.
This is a private matter, Jackie.
It is not for you to get involved.
I've watched Zach and Grace for two years now.
And I thank you,
but I don't need your help anymore.
Excuse me?
My children are grown.
They don't need your help. But thank you.
And I'm glad you got time to spend together.
How can you talk this way?
Because I am this way.
Your son has made me this way.
My son loves you.
You will see your grandchildren, Jackie.
Don't worry, I will make that happen.
And again I thank you.
You were a lifesaver when I needed a lifesaver,
but that's over now.
And I have to get to court.
Damn you to hell.
Your Honor, this is not about one liver.
This is about their class action.
Mr. Roda, stop. I don't care.
I still have to adjudicate the case in front of me.
Ms. Lockhart.
It is our understanding the hospital administrator,
Mr. Haynes, was not called away on an emergency call.
Instead, he is staying at his vacation home in Michigan.
We ask that Your Honor compel his presence in court
or censure opposing counsel for their deception.
Mr. Roda?
I... Your Honor, we have no knowledge of this alleged location.
Well, then, let me get you their phone and address.
Your Honor,
we ask that you disqualify Lockhart/Gardner
as counsel for the plaintiff.
It's come to our attention that our retired first chair,
Miss Nyholm, has hired Diane Lockhart
as a counsel in a suit against us.
Really?
Well, what happened there?
Our firm found it necessary to relieve Miss Nyholm of her position,
and she has since hired their firm
to sue us for damages.
Miss Nyholm, is this true?
Oh, yeah. It's really quite dramatic.
I'm sure you can understand, Your Honor,
Miss Nyholm knows our stratagems
and all the specifics of our defense.
Mr. Roda,
I can't tell Miss Nyholm which firm she can hire.
Yes, but you can insist on a strict division
between Miss Nyholm's case and this one.
That's correct.
Miss Nyholm, do you understand that there
must be a strict division between these two cases?
I do.
Your Honor, Miss Nyholm just grinned
and winked at us when you said that.
I did not. I don't wink.
Miss Nyholm, without grinning,
do you promise to keep these two cases separate?
I do, Your Honor.
This is so unprofessional.
Please talk to my lawyer.
Mr. Andrews, hello. I'm Will Gardner,
Miss Nyholm's attorney. It's nice to meet you.
Do you have a moment?
If Patti looks at her partnership agreement,
she'll see grievances must proceed through
automatic arbitration first.
Yes, and we're ready;
we have an arbiter on call.
Well, unfortunately, my schedule won't clear up for a few weeks.
Well, unfortunately, that's not gonna work for us.
We need you to meet now.
Really? Or...?
Or Patti and I are gonna have a very long conversation
about class action suits.
And you know how we pregnant women like to talk.
I will not negotiate with a gun to my head.
So don't. Just negotiate.
Not if you were the last man standing, buddy.
Welcome to arbitration.
I am retired Judge Loni Goslin.
This is an automatic process intended to encourage
the free exchange of grievances,
and a presentation of witnesses and exhibits.
And where is your plaintiff today, Mr. Gardner?
She should be here any minute.
My apologies, Your Honor.
I really must insist on punctuality.
Um, your Honor, I would remind you
of the liquidated damages provision
in Miss Nyholm's contract specifying
a $50,000 payout in such circumstances.
That is far beyond the $8.6 million she is demanding.
Yes, but the provision doesn't cover punitive.
You fired her because she was pregnant.
That is such complete and utter hogwash.
We fired her because she was alienating clients.
We were losing people.
As you can see from these grievance reports,
Miss Nyholm has extreme mood swings,
moments of temper flashes.
As you can see from this America Pregnancy Association report,
those are potential side effects of a pregnancy.
Oh, come on. You yourself complained
how she uses her pregnancy.
I am so sorry I'm late.
I was changing diapers. What a mess.
Oh, my goodness,
look at you with your little hat!
Isn't it sweet? I knitted it myself.
And what a big girl, you are, aren't you?
I'm so sorry, I thought I'd have day care today.
No, that's okay. Isn't it okay?
I don't know how you do it, Zoe.
It must be hard working here.
Sometimes.
Yeah, I usually look on the bright side of things.
And sometimes there isn't a bright side,
so...
I have to go home,
take a shower and wash it off.
Oh, I asked about the commotion earlier.
Um, we're having someone in for an operation.
I guess he's pretty big,
so we had to clear some space.
Kevin Haynes.
I am Harbor Hospital's Associate Administrator.
Thank you, Mr. Haynes.
And how was your emergency?
Objection.
Sustained. Ms. Lockhart.
My apologies, Your Honor.
Mr. Haynes, tell me who Jeffrey Berkoff is.
Who Jeffrey Berkoff is?
An Internet CEO.
Yes, and multimillionaire.
How much has he donated to your hospital?
Objection, Your Honor.
I'm not sure what this has to do with this case.
I'm not sure either, so why don't we find out together?
Was my client, Marjorie Garnett, removed from the donors list
so that Mr. Berkoff could receive a liver?
No, not at all.
But Mr. Berkoff is being flown in to receive
this liver right now, isn't he?
Room in the Donors' Suite is being made for him?
Yes, but that has nothing to do with Miss Garnett's case.
The allocation of organs is an objective matter
governed by the ORSN computers.
The only relevant factors are organ suitability, age...
And the advance of the disease
which is determined by a specialist?
Yes, but...
So the computers put Miss Garnett at the top of the list,
but a Harbor Hospital doctor removed her from it?
Well... that's an oversimplification.
Did you know that Jeffrey Berkoff donated $600,000
to your hospital?
You're far away from home.
I need your help.
Okay.
What's going on with Lockhart/Gardner?
You're worried about your job?
Peter Florrick isn't gonna want the guy
who made an enemy of his wife.
Diane was sniffing around me for a while
to have me come back, but
I think Will had some concerns.
Can you talk to him?
Really?
Well, I don't think that's gonna fly with Miss Nyholm.
$1 million.
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.
Of course Miss Nyholm didn't tell us about Berkoff.
We have our own investigator here.
He hung up on me.
I don't think he takes you seriously.
Or you.
She's a piece of work, huh?
And yet she has her moments.
Congratulations on Peter, by the way.
I saw his speech, it was good.
Are you excited?
I'm... busy.
I bet he will be, too.
Why don't you take a week off after all this.
Spend some time with him.
Hello there.
You waking up?
Little sleepyhead.
You want to hear a story?
No.
Once there was...
Turn it back up.
a big castle...
What?
with many wonderful machines in it.
And all the machines cost a lot of money to keep up.
And so the king had to keep using the machines
and charging for their use.
Good story.
And so, when all the king's horses
and all the king's men came to the castle,
they were charged exorbitant prices.
Your dad and I have separated.
You...
What?
Why?
Because...
we decided it was time.
I-I don't understand.
Why now?
Because I wanted to now.
This was all just to get Dad elected, wasn't it?
What?
Staying together.
The day after the election, you get separated.
Yes, but that is not the reason why.
Then why?
I needed to see if the marriage would work.
And it hasn't.
Your dad has moved into an apartment
a few miles away.
My God, we're those kids.
No, you're not those kids-- you're our kids.
I know this is hard,
but I need you to deal with this a little while longer.
So what, do we just go back and forth?
I don't know. We haven't worked out the details.
But I need something more from you.
People are interested in what happens to us,
so I need you to keep our current situation
from anyone outside the family.
'Cause it will hurt Dad?
Yes.
And it could hurt us, too.
I think that there's a lot of attention
to families like ours, and I...
I don't want to feed that.
But, Mom... Mom, it's lying.
That's hypocritical.
Yes. And you two are old enough to understand that.
We don't lie here.
We... we don't lie to each other,
but when people want to hurt us,
it's sometimes all right to
not tell the full truth.
You understand?
Grace?
Mom, you need to protect us more.
Oh, Mom, I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.
No.
I love you so much.
You didn't ask for any of this.
And I...
We're good. We're gonna be good.
We're gonna be good.
Okay, so here's where we stand.
Patti's clearly pointing us in a direction,
but she's not filling in the blanks.
So see what you can get on hospital over-testing.
I have someone in the hospital I can talk to.
You should give Cary a chance.
A chance to what?
Come back here.
Hey.
Hello.
Hello?
Everything all right?
Yep. Got to get to work.
Sure.
When did you get billed?
Uh, sorry, I must have left them at home.
I was looking at the bill and I was surprised
to see that there were tests on there
that I don't remember approving.
CT scans?
That sounds right.
Was it Dr. Lawton?
Yeah.
He can be a bit overcautious with the radiation scans.
He's actually been warned about it a few times.
Same with the other doctors.
Just challenge it.
Okay. Thank you.
No problem.
Hey, do you want to get lunch sometime?
Oh, I'm-I'm sorry.
Um, uh, forget it.
I just don't really meet that many nice people.
No, no, sure.
Th-That sounds nice.
Give me your number.
Great.
I don't believe it.
It's true.
But why?
Because she's selfish.
Oh, stop it.
She won't swallow her pride.
She won't forgive him.
It's easier to leave him.
Jackie, it isn't the '50s.
What did she say?
Alicia-- she said nothing.
And Peter won't say anything either.
But he's devastated.
I need you to talk to her.
You need me?
She likes you.
You can explain things.
You know it's bad for Peter.
It's bad for home, it's bad for work.
The itsy-bitsy spider
went up the waterspout...
I'm sorry, Your Honor.
This is the only way I can get her to fall asleep.
Oh, that's okay, really.
Let me guess-- you couldn't find day care,
again.
Your Honor, we would like introduce something
into evidence we were hoping to avoid.
Oh, I'm sure you were.
Our firm wanted to relieve Miss Nyholm of her duties quietly,
because, the truth is,
we discovered she was stealing clients.
Miss Nyholm tried to steal their business
and start her own firm.
Well?
Of course I was trying to start my own firm,
because I knew they were trying to fire me.
Yeah, but they weren't trying to fire you
because you were pregnant.
They were trying to fire me because I have a working vagina.
And because Jerry Maguire
Roda out there is their new golden boy.
Of course it was about my pregnancy.
Is there an e-mail out there saying that? No.
Would you write that e-mail, Will?
Of course not, but you'd still do it.
Take all the cases away from the pregnant woman
and give them to the new Harvard boy with the penis.
Where are we?
Cross-examination of the hospital administrator.
Hit them hard,
because what happens there is scaring them here.
Hello, Dr. Lawton.
You're Marjorie Garnett's specialist?
Yes, I am.
And you're the doctor who decided her condition was so extreme
you removed her from transplant consideration?
Well, I was the doctor who examined her
and tested her and found
her liver tumor had exceeded five centimeters,
which is routinely the cutoff for patient viability.
You mentioned testing.
How many CT scans did you run on Marjorie?
Excuse me, Your Honor.
Objection. Relevance?
I'm asking about Marjorie's care.
It seems essentially relevant.
Overruled. You may answer, Doctor.
I believe I ran three CT scans.
Why?
Why did I run three?
Sometimes I like to be more thorough.
You seem to frequently be more thorough.
Didn't the hospital warn you
about your overuse of radiation testing?
Objection, Your Honor. Again.
This is a fishing expedition.
Okay. I admit to being lost here.
What fish are you afraid Mrs. Florrick is chasing?
She is attempting to use an ongoing investigation
into Harbor Hospital into...
Excuse me.
I think the word you're looking for is over-testing.
Your Honor, we request a short recess
to talk with the plaintiff's attorney.
Anything that gets us to a settlement, I am all for.
We have a sworn affidavit from the donor databank.
We knew nothing about the next potential donee on that list.
It was completely blind.
It doesn't matter what you knew.
It matters what Dr. Lawton knew.
But you're not looking closely enough.
Dr. Lawton didn't know.
No one knew who the computers would assign that liver to.
We still have you on over-testing.
Yes, you do, ma'am.
And we're vulnerable on that front,
but that still doesn't change the fact
that you're stealing a liver
from one worthy candidate to give to another.
We have looked at your worthy candidate.
He's ten months away from death.
I'm fighting your suit,
Ms. Lockhart, Mrs. Florrick,
and you know why?
Because we're right.
This is not about saving the hospital money.
This is about preserving the integrity of the donor list.
Marjorie Garnett is near death,
and she needs to accept that fact.
You two need to, as well.
I heard.
We have 12 hours.
Yes.
We haven't given up yet.
I know.
I haven't, either.
As far as we can tell, the doctors didn't know
the organ would go to Jeffrey Berkoff,
so we don't have that avenue anymore.
You know,
I loved being a mom.
If I had it to do all over again, I...
I would have done it differently.
Really?
It looks like it was fun.
Well, I wouldn't have done it all differently.
I don't want to die.
What will he remember of me?
Has Dr. Lawton seen these?
Oh, yeah.
He says I was quite the partier.
It's just odd.
Last time I was here, you were firing me.
A lot of water under that bridge.
So, Cary, you've proven yourself valuable
in the State's Attorney's office,
and we're starting to look to expand,
but we're always wanting a...
...balance of personalities.
Okay.
I guess I'm wondering, will you still fit in here?
Well, I have done a lot of growing, being away.
So I want to fit in,
wherever I go.
And you won't mind coming over to the dark side?
I think I'll find it a challenge.
So you'd be willing to come back as a second-year associate.
That won't feel like a step down?
Thought I'd be coming back as a third-year.
Yes. But your second year
was with the State's Attorney's office, so...
It's only a title, Cary.
We'd still offer all of the perks and salary bumps
that I discussed.
Sorry.
Look, I've seen the way third-years treat second-years.
It's not just a title.
Cary, listen. We're growing again.
And as we grow, we're hiring people back.
And we can't break precedent by giving something to you
that we don't give to others.
Think about it, Cary.
And Alicia will be a third-year?
Eli, I have to prepare for a cross-examination.
This will only take a minute.
And it's important.
I'm about to argue for a woman's life.
Is it more important than that?
Okay, I thought I could top that.
No.
You separated from Peter.
Peter told you?
Jackie.
The second that phone rings, I have to go.
Is it irrevocable?
My decision to leave Peter?
Yes.
Okay. Wait.
Does that mean it will change or...?
No, it won't.
I don't want to ask you why,
but you do know this will look politically motivated.
Not the separation, the marriage.
I've already talked to Zach and Grace.
And you should talk to Peter.
It will hurt everyone if this becomes a big thing.
Yeah. Okay.
Have you thought about couple's counseling?
No.
I know I'm not the best advertisement for it,
but my ex-wife and I went through it.
And it wasn't... as bad as I thought.
Thank you.
And thank you for not trying to talk me out of it.
Should I try?
Gotta go.
Go save a life.
Dr. Lawton,
who is Marcus Orr, Sheryl Kirk
and Gabriel Elba?
They are my patients.
And like Marjorie, they suffered from liver failure?
Yes.
But unlike Marjorie,
they received liver transplants.
How many CT scans did you order performed on each?
I don't remember.
One?
That sounds about right.
And who are leeLee Basso, Cynthia Hickey and Linda Gould?
Also my patients.
And how many CT scans did you perform on them?
Again, you're going to have to tell me.
Three, four and five.
Which is odd,
being that the last three patients, and my client,
are almost 20 years younger.
Well, as I said, age is not always a determining factor.
Yes, but appearance seems to be.
Objection.
Sustained.
Dr. Lawton, of all your liver patients,
these are the only four patients
with tattoos and body piercings.
I- I don't remember, I don't keep track.
During your examination of Marjorie,
you asked her how much alcohol
she consumed in her youth, is that correct?
I don't know. Probably.
And why is that important to know?
Well, it's not essential to know.
It helps contribute to a fuller picture of the patient's lifestyle.
And why is lifestyle important?
Well, as a doctor...
How shall I put this?
Any way you want.
Lifestyle matters to the future health of a patient.
Are you more likely to downgrade the status
of a woman you blame for her liver condition?
No.
Then how can you explain the need
for subjecting these four patients-- and only these four patients--
to additional CT scans?
I don't think I- I have to explain.
I am a very careful doctor.
This is the most I can offer.
I am having another doctor
look over the first CAT scans,
and if he doesn't find anything irregular in Miss Garnett's test,
we'll hopefully have time to reassess.
Not much time. Six hours.
Then I'd better get going.
There's a chance.
Oh, my God.
Nothing's certain yet.
Thank you, Mr. Haynes, for taking a closer look
at Dr. Lawton's overuse of CAT scans.
And thank you for determining there was bias there.
I would object to that characterization.
Mr. Haynes reversed Dr. Lawton's decision
in the case of Marjorie Garnett.
He did this for humanitarian reasons:
to save Miss Garnett's life.
And once again, thank you.
But that has no impact on this negotiation: your class action.
Well, it sure doesn't look good.
There are four patients we know already
who suffered from Dr. Lawton's bias.
My guess is we turn up more.
My guess is bias is in the eye of the beholder.
Well, it's too bad we have a former lawyer of yours
who can help us on that front.
I am so sorry I'm late. Are we all playing nice in here?
Very nice.
You...
Yep.
They fired Roda, and asked me back.
Isn't it great?
With better benefits.
So I dropped the lawsuit.
But thank you so much, Will.
Really.
It probably wouldn't have happened without you.
We'll object to your using anything you discovered from us.
I couldn't have discovered anything from you,
because you stood up in court
and swore to a strict separation of these cases.
So. Shall we get started?
No.
We're talking.
We talked.
We're talking some more.
I don't want our children hearing this.
I phoned a marriage counselor.
Her name is Anne Gerbadine.
She's very thorough, she seems very smart,
and I'm going to start seeing her next week.
I don't want to lose you, Alicia.
If you ask me to give up the State's Attorney's office today,
I'd do it in a heartbeat.
Lucky me.
I know you're hurt.
I know you're angry...
No, Peter.
It's a "No."
What is?
Everything.
Counseling.
An explanation.
Anything you ask, anything you say.
You're sleeping with Will, aren't you?
That's what this is about, isn't it?
You and Will.
There have been three people in this marriage.
Every moment of the last two years,
you've been thinking about him.
Go ahead, tell me that's not true.
Oh, my God, the gall!
I'll take the blame for what I did. I'll take it happily.
But you share that.
Is that why you're here?
To disperse blame?
Really?
That's the saddest thing I've ever heard.
Are you divorcing me?
I haven't decided.
Well, please, let me know when you decide.
Yep. You and Kalinda. I've got her number, too.
She's blameless in this.
Oh, really?
Did you rape her?
She didn't even know you then.
She knew you were married.
It's okay. It's all right, Alicia.
Have at it.
You're the injured one.
No one else.
There's nothing anyone can say, right?
Yes, there is.
So say something. Say something, Peter.
Say something that'll make me fall in love with you again.
Good-bye.
Yep. You got that right.
Well, you must be thinking about the old Peter Florrick,
because I'm not in the favor-granting mood today.
Yeah?
Cary Agos, Mr. Florrick.
I work in the State's Attorney's office.
I'm not making any hiring or firing decisions.
I understand that. I just want to...
You understand that, but you're still here.
I don't want you to be biased against me
because of my first job.
All decisions will be based on
seniority and departmental needs.
I just...
I know Alicia and I, we've had our differences.
And at first, I thought the best thing was just to let it go.
But I think it's better to explain things.
And you know Alicia from...?
