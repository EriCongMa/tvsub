can i get everybody &apos;s attension . real quick .
um , on this wonderful occasion--
our daughter leaving tomorrow for college ...
if i could get everyone to raise their glass .
as i quote from one of our nation &apos;s great fathers--
jefferson .
george jefferson .
&quot; i never dreamed that one of my own
&quot; would be going off to a university ,
&quot; but here i stand , a proud black man ,
knowing that all those hours i put in at the dry cleaner-- &quot;
phil .
not now , weezie .
where was i ?
quoting that president .
okay , if she &apos;s the future of america ,
we should start using chinese money now .
we already are .
my arm is tired . to haley .
to haley !
and before everyone puts their glasses down ,
uh , uh , we &apos;re also very proud of lily .
tomorrow is her first day of kindergarten .
to lily .
oh , lily .
to lily . and you &apos;ll be impressed to know
that she &apos;s gonna be one of the smartest girls there .
lily , sweetie , what &apos;s the square root of 64 ?
8 .
wow . hey !
nice trick .
hey , lily , what &apos;s the square root of this potato ?
8 .
congratulations . you have a parrot .
we couldn &apos;t even get through the toast to haley
before you pulled focus to lily .
oh , come on . it &apos;s--it &apos;s a big day for both of them . huh ?
haley going to college is a miracle .
lily going to kindergarten is the law .
well , haley and lily aren &apos;t the only ones starting school .
my mom and jay are going to parenting class .
we &apos;re doing it for the baby .
not this baby . that baby .
manny doesn &apos;t believe that we know what we &apos;re doing .
a couple of new hairs under his arm ,
and now he thinks he knows more than his own mother .
i know not to embarrass my son
as he stands on the threshold of manhood .
i don &apos;t know why i have to go to this thing .
in case you &apos;ve forgotten , i raised two kids .
stop pulling my hair .
stop twisting my nipple . ow !
shut up . shut up .
why look at me ? it was their mother &apos;s fault .
i was barely around .
no ! ow , ow !
haley , this is , like , the third bag
of makeup and hair care products .
dad , if you want me to get good grades , i have to look cute .
don &apos;t say a word .
no . no . i agree with that premise .
thank you . wait .
yeah , thank you .
claire .
in haley &apos;s stuff , a box of condoms .
yeah . um , i @-@ i bought those for her .
what ? why don &apos;t you just buy her some fishnet stockings
and a nurse &apos;s outfit ?
not that that &apos;s my thing . that just popped into my head .
honey , she &apos;s an adult , and she &apos;s going to college .
i want to be realistic .
i don &apos;t want her to get caught unprepared .
24 times ? what , are you buying her a 4 @-@ year supply ?
please . phil , that would &apos;ve lasted me
and my college boyfriend , like , a long--
la , la , la , la , la , la , la !
okay , we gotta hit the road .
give your sister a hug good @-@ bye .
don &apos;t dork up our room .
don &apos;t slut up your college .
seriously , though , don &apos;t study too hard , okay ?
i &apos;m totally going to have fun .
i &apos;m iceland in the mock u.n.
mom , we &apos;re gonna lose her .
i am doing my best .
luke , come say good @-@ bye to your sister .
i &apos;m right here .
bye , haley . have fun .
don &apos;t drink too much beer and shots of tequila .
why are you wearing that mask ?
uh , i like it .
he doesn &apos;t want you to see him cry .
he &apos;s literally masking his emotions .
no !
that &apos;s so sweet .
come here .
it &apos;s not sweet . i &apos;m an evil cyborg .
half my face was burned off in an industrial accident ,
and the mask is hiding the servos that control my mouth .
yes , i am sad haley is leaving ,
but i &apos;m gonna be okay knowing i &apos;ve done everything i can
to get her set up and prepared and off on the right foot .
not me . when we &apos;re standing in her dorm room saying good @-@ bye ,
it &apos;s gonna be one of the most emotional moments of my life .
i &apos;m gonna cry harder than the first time i saw &quot; air bud ... &quot;
especially when i give her this .
&quot; phil &apos;s @-@ osophy . &quot;
a hardbound collection of all the life lessons i &apos;ve learned ,
such as ...
&quot; always look people in the eye ,
&quot; even if they &apos;re blind .
just say , &apos; i &apos;m looking you in the eye . &apos; &quot;
or ...
&quot; if you get pulled over for speeding ,
tell the policeman your spouse has diarrhea . &quot;
phil &apos;s @-@ osophy .
look how much fun you &apos;re gonna have here , lily .
so many great toys to play with ,
and you &apos;re gonna make so many new friends .
oh , i wish i was in kindergarten again .
oh , not me . did i ever tell you about david anthony ?
he used to call me &quot; cam the ham . &quot;
okay , lily &apos;s day .
yeah , you &apos;re right .
you know what ? it &apos;s gonna be a great day .
i &apos;m just saying , it &apos;s difficult to grow up
with a name that rhymes with &quot; ham . &quot;
hello ? mitch ? witch . twitch .
bitch .
elaine stritch .
what ?
not all bullies are straight .
okay , parents ...
oh ! we &apos;ll see you at 12 : 00 .
all right . mm !
this is when the crying starts .
does it ever stop ?
come on , cam .
okay . you know what , lily , sweetie ?
i know this is gonna be difficult--
bye !
okay . that was a knife to the heart .
no , it &apos;s--it &apos;s a good thing . come on .
oh , you know what ? she forgot her snack . oh .
where &apos;d she go ?
ow ! that hurts ! ow ! that hurts !
oh , lily , honey !
sweetheart , come here . come here .
if you ever put your hands on my daughter again ,
i will string you up by your feet , run you up the flagpole ,
and let the birds peck out your eyes .
you understand ?
mr. tucker , put that boy down !
he pulled my daughter &apos;s hair .
please apologize to connor
for using your hands instead of your words .
sorry , little fella .
i would like to see you in my office . right .
now , please .
me , too ? oh .
stop it . leave him alone .
mr. tucker , what happened out there was unacceptable .
i agree . is this kindergarten or &quot; the hunger games &quot; ?
i &apos;m speaking of your behavior .
we &apos;ve never had an incident like this ,
and now we &apos;ve had one on the first day ,
before circle time .
what the fudge were you thinking ?
now the boy &apos;s parents are coming in , and trust me ,
they &apos;re mad as hello kitty .
oh , you told his parents on us ?
that is--that is so not cool .
well , i &apos;m sure once they hear what their boy did ,
they will be understanding .
all right , whoever made our son cry
has messed with the wrong moms .
lesbians .
while often lumped together , gay men and lesbians
have less in common than one might think .
like in the venn diagram of sexual identity ,
you have gay men ...
and straight men .
both the same gender .
then you have gay men ...
and straight women .
both attracted to the same gender .
but gay men and lesbians ?
no .
nothing .
i am so sorry we have to meet like this ,
but i &apos;m sure you can understand , as parents ,
the instinct to protect your child .
yeah , it &apos;s what makes me want to punch you in the neck right now .
wow . i see where your son gets all of his aggression .
okay , let &apos;s all take a time @-@ out .
that &apos;s a good idea . this is getting a little heated .
yeah , pam ,
we don &apos;t want another incident like at the lumberyard .
oh , my god . you guys go to the lumberyard , too ? d--
i didn &apos;t know they had a ladies &apos; night .
not the bar , sally .
okay , you know what ? he &apos;s trying to be nice ,
and you just called him &quot; sally . &quot;
yeah , you &apos;re not being very helpful , peppermint patty .
okay . let &apos;s just stick to our actual names .
enough .
i &apos;m gonna give you a little homework assignment .
i want you and your kids to have a family playdate .
maybe if the four of you can get along ,
you can set a better example for your children .
i think that &apos;s a wonderful idea . pam ?
fine .
cam ?
fine . we &apos;ll host , obviously .
&quot; obviously &quot; ?
i assume you have an unfinished woodworking project at your house .
you &apos;ve got a lot of nerve .
yeah , and you &apos;ve got half a canoe in our living room .
i look forward to your frittata .
oh . why , are you visiting us in 2008 ?
oh , my god .
you have some explaining to do .
i &apos;m so sorry that you had to find out like this , jay .
wow , you two are really far along .
we &apos;re , uh , we &apos;re still in our first trimester .
ay , that &apos;s nice .
yeah , we &apos;ve been trying to get pregnant for ages .
she &apos;s latina . you just gotta look at her funny .
okay , now that everyone has their doll ,
let &apos;s talk about swaddling .
now you want to start by turning one corner of the blanket
toward you , like a diamond ,
and folding the top down ,
like this .
i think they made a mistake at the hospital .
tough room .
now we are going to pull the other corner &apos; round ,
and tuck it in nice and snug
like a burrito .
done ! i win .
it &apos;s not a race .
you &apos;re darn right . it wasn &apos;t even close .
okay , it &apos;s good , but it &apos;s a little tight .
it &apos;s a burrito . you don &apos;t want the meat to fall out .
here . and try like this .
and see ?
now your baby can breathe .
i wrapped my son with one hand while driving a stick .
i think i know how to keep a baby safe .
man , i love being back in the dorms .
it &apos;s like i never left .
throw up a david copperfield poster ,
this could be my room .
honey , haley and i have to go fill out some paperwork .
why don &apos;t you throw the linens on the bed ?
oh , and move the car before they tow us .
okay .
oh , my god . what is that shirt ? !
pretty sweet , huh ? &quot; haley dunphy moving co . &quot;
&apos;cause we &apos;re moving you here and here .
and also ...
here .
man , you used to love it when we swung you like that .
i bet we could still do it .
yeah !
yeah .
oh , no , no . no , no , no , no , no .
don &apos;t you dare pick me up ! and take that shirt off .
what ? why ?
it &apos;s cute !
it &apos;s not cute ! do you see what &apos;s happening out there ?
people are walking around and judging each other .
no , they &apos;re not .
oh , really ?
you didn &apos;t see the way
muffin top across the hall was looking at me ?
people can be cruel . so take it off .
fine .
oh , my god ! put on a shirt !
i don &apos;t know what you want from me !
&quot; you only get one chance at a first impression .
i suggest julia child , because it &apos;s easy to do . &quot;
&quot; save the giblets . &quot;
time to go to the beach !
you &apos;re gonna go to the beach with a dog ?
i don &apos;t know what i did
to deserve this .
yeah .
i want to show connor my toys .
oh , okay . you do that , sweetie .
hey , connor , uh , no hair pulling .
thank you for that .
okay , we have an assortment of spring rolls here .
all vegetarian , of course .
oh , &apos; cause i &apos;m a lesbian , i &apos;m automatically a vegetarian ?
well , i saw it on &quot; the l word . &quot;
i assume they have consultants .
i &apos;m just saying it &apos;s an offensive stereotype .
okay , pam , you are a vegetarian .
knock it off .
worked out .
yeah . so glad that we are doing this .
yeah . yeah , me , too .
yeah .
i mean , we &apos;re the only gay parents in the class .
yeah , we should be supporting one another .
i mean , we have so much in common .
exactly .
so ...
tell us about yourselves .
i &apos;m an environmental lawyer .
uh , and i &apos;m a homemaker .
and--and , uh , and what do you do ?
i &apos;m a financial consultant .
i &apos;m a contractor .
you thought i was a p.e. teacher ?
well , figured .
hey , i have a question real quick .
how do you guys get the car seat on the motorcycle ?
uh , you know , connor is having a birthday next week .
maybe lily would like to come .
oh , she would love that .
oh , great . are you guys having a clown ?
oh , god , no .
i hate clowns they &apos;re so creepy .
maybe you just don &apos;t like them because they wear makeup .
you know what ? i &apos;m out .
okay .
pam .
connor , we &apos;re leaving !
you--you don &apos;t understand .
pam ! pam !
cam used to be a clown .
&quot; used to be &quot; ? once a clown , always a clown .
god ! not now ! not now !
connor , let &apos;s go .
pam .
why is this door locked ?
here . let me , please .
lily , open this door right now .
okay . i &apos;m not hearing anything .
i &apos;m sure they &apos;re fine .
oh , how are you sure ?
connor !
lily !
connor !
lily !
make the water comfortably warm
90 to 100 degrees max .
and never leave the tub unsupervised .
is there something you two want to share with the class ?
no . it &apos;s dirty .
excuse me . we &apos;re trying to learn here .
don &apos;t worry so much . babies are tougher than you think .
when i was 5 years old , my babysitter was a goat .
what ?
ay , please . you know about lupe .
you never said she was a goat .
you know , it &apos;s great that we have
a couple of experienced parents in the class .
perhaps you can share some of your wisdom with the rest of us .
absolutely . it &apos;s not rocket science .
it &apos;s babies . they &apos;re hungry , you feed &apos; em .
they &apos;re teething , you give &apos; em some scotch .
scotch ?
really ? are you serious ?
what ?
so we left .
i didn &apos;t need a lecture from mary poppins .
and i was suddenly in a mood for a burrito .
i &apos;d like admission to your student body .
oh , my goodness !
i am so sorry . i thought you were my wife .
what &apos;s going on ?
he grabbed me and said--
i thought she was my wife . my wife works out a lot .
dad ?
how &apos;d he grab you ?
he squeezed my butt .
he what ?
phil !
i thought it was you !
believe me , sir . i &apos;m a respected realtor .
this is an innocent mistake .
honey , turn around and show him your--your butt .
it--it &apos;s uncanny .
dad .
i am very normal . please do not judge me based on them .
are those your my little pony sheets ?
what ? no !
i ordered them online .
they must &apos;ve sent the wrong ones . i &apos;m very sorry .
that &apos;s what was in the box .
okay .
uh , for the record , i am a respected realtor .
those are not my condoms .
she bought &apos; em .
oh , my god .
apparently , that &apos;s what people do these days--
buy condoms for their kids .
when i went to college ,
my parents bought me a bicycle helmet .
that was their idea of safety .
certainly didn &apos;t need condoms .
mm , not if you were wearing
a bike helmet around campus , you didn &apos;t . am i right ?
why don &apos;t we let you guys finish ,
and we &apos;ll come back later ?
okay .
yeah .
yep .
yeah , that sounds good .
see you on parents weekend !
they seem nice .
guys , i--
i know . i know .
look , we need to reorganize a little .
your dad will go out and get us some new sheets .
you and i can hang up all the pictures on the walls .
you know what ? i think it &apos;s best if you guys get going .
but we--we wanted to help you , sweetie .
no , i got it .
w @-@ what if you wanna move the furniture around ?
and we were gonna take you to dinner before we left .
i like the furniture where it is , and i &apos;m not hungry .
so ...
okay .
okay .
um , well , uh , before we leave ,
i wanted to give you a little present .
it &apos;s actually not a little present .
it &apos;s probably the best present you &apos;re ever gonna get .
it &apos;s a collection of all the things i &apos;ve learned--
thanks .
attention .
dorm meeting in the common room .
okay , so ...
i better go .
i know .
okay .
okay , come here . that &apos;s my girl .
let me get in there .
okay .
all right .
bye !
bye .
&quot; the most amazing things that can happen to a human being
will happen to you
if you just lower your expectations . &quot;
oh , they &apos;ve got something over the hole .
lily !
connor !
we can &apos;t see anything from outside .
the curtains are closed .
open up , connor ! we &apos;ll let you have a hot dog !
what if something happened to them ?
what kind of hazards do you keep in there ?
well , let &apos;s see . that &apos;s where we keep our gun collection ,
our abandoned refrigerator ,
and our chocolate @-@ covered hypodermic needles .
why are gay men always so sarcastic ?
it &apos;s my coping mechanism !
okay , that &apos;s it !
lily , connor , if you can hear me ,
back away from the door . i &apos;m gonna break it down .
i &apos;ll help you .
i don &apos;t want connor to go !
i wanna stay !
oh , thank god they &apos;re alive !
i love him !
no , you love the idea of him . now open this door , sweetie .
can we really have hot dogs ?
yes , we promise .
oh ! come here , sweetheart .
if you ask me ...
sometimes we get so hang up on our differences .
we forget there &apos;s one thing that we have in common .
when it comes to the safety and well @-@ being of our children ,
we &apos;re all a little bit nuts .
you have dainty little hands , just like your daughter .
you have boots like my dad .
i &apos;m not saying that the goat put me to sleep or brushed my teeth .
it just stayed outside my bedroom window
and scared all the strangers away .
well , i &apos;m not gonna lie . i &apos;m a little disappointed .
hey , kid !
jay , mom , how was class ?
it was great . it was very educating and--
and now we know everything about the baby , no ?
interesting , because your teacher called ,
and you forgot your sunglasses when you left ...
three hours early .
ay , manny , don &apos;t be mad .
i &apos;m not mad . just disappointed .
i hate this . i prefer when he screams .
manny , it &apos;s no big deal .
they weren &apos;t telling us anything we didn &apos;t already know .
we &apos;re going to have a baby .
am i the only one who &apos;s terrified ?
but why ?
why are you so terrified ?
what if it doesn &apos;t know not to pick up knives
or stick its finger in an electric socket ?
you were pretty lax , mom .
i was the one who told you
to turn the pot handles towards the stove
so i couldn &apos;t reach them .
manny , i didn &apos;t worry about those things
because you worried for the both of us .
what if this baby doesn &apos;t think things through ?
it &apos;s part jay .
no offense taken .
if the baby &apos;s different , we &apos;ll be different .
hey .
when you were growing up ,
you had to be the man of the house and the kid .
now i &apos;m here . you just have to be the kid .
i &apos;m not gonna let anything happen to the baby ,
just like i &apos;m not ever gonna let anything happen to you .
okay ?
okay . that is a load off .
although you forgot to pick me up last week after tango class .
we didn &apos;t forget . we were just ten minutes late .
ten minutes is a long time in a sketchy neighborhood .
please . it was between a gymboree
and a pottery barn .
&quot; dance until your feet hurt .
sing until your lungs hurt .
act until you &apos;re william hurt . &quot;
how you doing ? are you okay ?
yeah . no , i &apos;m ...
i &apos;m--i &apos;m--i &apos;m good . you ?
fine . yeah .
great .
&quot; take a lesson from parakeets .
if you &apos;re ever feeling lonely ,
just eat in front of a mirror . &quot;
&quot; never be afraid to reach for the stars ,
because even if you fall ,
you &apos;ll always be wearing a parent @-@ chute . &quot;
tm . &quot;
haley . hi , honey . you okay ?
yeah .
where are you guys ?
almost home , honey .
dad , i really like that book .
you do ?
sweetheart , is everything okay ?
yeah , i just wanted to say thank you for everything ,
you know , today and stuff .
o @-@ of course .
sure .
of course . if--if you need anything at all ...
you just call us .
i &apos;ll probably need some more condoms soon .
not funny .
i &apos;m sending you some care bear sheets .
anyway ,
i should probably get going . we have orientation at 7 : 00 a.m.
g @-@ good luck with that , sweetie .
i love you , guys .
we love you , too , honey .
so , so much .
bye .
bye , haley .
i &apos;ll miss you .
&quot; marry someone who looks sexy while disappointed . &quot;
