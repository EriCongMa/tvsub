except for kevin millmore , may he rot in hell .
you just gotta do it .
i know . but it &apos;s just so hard .
you &apos;re sitting there with her . she has no idea .
you finally get up the courage to do it .
there &apos;s that awkward moment when you &apos;ve handed her the note .
you try to run out of the restaurant before she &apos;s finished the note .
why do you have to break up with her ? be a man . just stop calling .
if you want , i &apos;ll do it with you .
she &apos;d feel like we &apos;re ganging up on her .
you dump janice , i &apos;ll dump t ony .
you &apos;re breaking up with t ony ?
he &apos;s sweet , but it &apos;s not fun anymore .
i don &apos;t know if it &apos;s me or his hunger strike , i don &apos;t know .
do you want anything else ?
you had a nutty , chocolate @-@ y , kind of cake @-@ y , pie thing that

i hate when my father calls me that .

no .
and the fabric softener ?
okay , now what is wrong with my snuggles ?

bullwinkle socks .
that &apos;s sweet .
i knew you had rockys .
you can wear bullwinkle and bullwinkle or rocky and rocky , or you can mix .
moose and squirrel . whatever you want .
i &apos;m gonna get another espresso . more latte ?

these go with your rockys . she really cares about you l &apos; m sorry .
coming through . move . move !
excuse me ! i was kind of using that machine .
yeah , well , now you &apos; re kind of not .
but i saved it . i put my basket on top .
i &apos;m sorry . is that your basket ?
it &apos;s pretty . unfortunately , i don &apos;t see suds !
what ?
no suds , no save , okay ?
what &apos;s going on ?
nothing . this horrible woman just took my machine .
was your basket on top ?
yeah , but there were no suds .

no suds , no excuse me .
hold on a second ! this is my friend &apos;s machine .

hey , hey , hey ! that &apos;s not the rule , and you know it !
all right . show &apos;s over .
nothing to see here .
okay . let &apos;s do laundry .
that was amazing ! i can &apos;t even send back soup .

do you ? do you ? oh , hey . you must need detergent .
what &apos;s that ?
uberweiss .
it &apos;s new . it &apos;s german . it &apos;s extra tough !
rach , are you gonna separate those ?
oh , god . am i being a total laundry spaz ?
am i supposed to use one machine for shirts and another for pants ?
have you never done this before ?
well , not myself . but i know other people that have .
okay . you caught me . i &apos;m a laundry virgin .
don &apos;t worry . i &apos;ll use the gentle cycle .
basically , you wanna use one machine for all your whites .
a whole other machine for your colors .
and a third for your ...
... delicates . that would be your bras ...
... and your underpanty things .
these are white cotton panties .
would they go with whites or with delicates ?
that would be a judgment call .
he &apos;s so cute !
where did you grow up ?
brooklyn heights .
cleveland .
how &apos;d that happen ?
my god !
what ?
i suddenly had the feeling i was falling .
but i &apos;m not .
so , you and angela , huh ?
yep . pretty much .
you &apos; re a lucky man .
know what i miss most about her ?
that cute nibbly noise she makes when she eats .
like a happy little squirrel ...
... or a weasel .
i never really noticed .
oh , yeah , yeah . listen for it .
monica . monica is great .
yeah , she is .
but it &apos;s not gonna last .
she &apos;s too much for me in bed .
sexually .
i &apos;ve gotta tell you , bob is terrific .
yeah , isn &apos;t he ?
it &apos;s great to meet a smart , funny guy who &apos;s emotionally older than 8 .
you know what else ? he &apos;s unbelievable in bed !
my brother never even told me when he lost his virginity .
that &apos;s nice .
you can . it &apos;s like pulling off a band @-@ aid .
just do it really fast , and then the wound is exposed .
go ! go !
hi , janice .
here we go . i don &apos;t think we should go out anymore .
all right .
well , there you go .
stop it , stop it , stop it .
this isn &apos;t about you .
i know ! it &apos;s about your fear of commitment .
i &apos; m not afraid .
please .
i don &apos;t !
i don &apos;t ! i &apos; m ready to commit anytime .
really ?
i know this is gonna sound stupid ...
... but i feel that if i can do this ...
... if i can actually do my own laundry ...
... there isn &apos;t anything i can &apos;t do .
that does not sound stupid to me .
the first time i had to cook for myself after carol left me
i &apos;m sorry , that &apos;s all the time we have . next on ross ....
uh @-@ oh . -what ?
uh @-@ oh .... the laundry &apos;s done .
it &apos;s a song .
the laundry song we sing .
uh @-@ oh ! the laundry &apos;s done
what &apos;s the matter ?
nothing .
the laundry &apos;s done
come on , show me .
it &apos;s just that you left a red sock with your whites , and now ...
... everything &apos;s kind of pink .
everything &apos;s pink ?
except for the red sock , which is still red .
don &apos;t be upset . it can happen to anyone .
but it happened to me .
god , i &apos;m gonna look like a big marshmallow peep !
what am i doing ?
my father &apos;s right ! i can &apos;t live on my own .
i can &apos;t even do laundry !
something went wrong with underdog and they couldn &apos;t inflate his head .
so anyway ...
... his head is flopping down broadway , right ?
and i &apos;m thinking how inappropriate this is .
something &apos;s in my eye . could we check it in the light , please ?
oh , my god !
what ?
were we at the same table ? it &apos;s like ...
... cocktails in appalachia .
they &apos; re close .
close ? her tongue &apos;s in his ear .
like you &apos;ve never got a little rambunctious with ross .
joey , this is sick . it &apos;s disgusting . it &apos;s ...
... not really true &apos; is it ?
who &apos;s to say what &apos;s true ?
what were you thinking ?
l &apos; m not proud of this , okay ?
well , maybe i am a little .
l &apos; m out of here !
wait !
you like him . i want her . he likes you .
really ?
yeah .
if we put our heads together , between the two of us ...
... we can break them up .
i &apos; m sorry . i can &apos;t believe i did this .
i couldn &apos;t stop laughing at your norman mailer story .
waiter ? one more plate of chicken wings over here .
here &apos;s the thing . we &apos;re different .
i &apos;m bing , bing , bing . you &apos; re boom , boom , boom .
oh , my god ! i &apos; m so sorry !
are you okay ?
it &apos;s just my lens . it &apos;s my lens .
i &apos;ll be right back .
i hit her in the eye ! in the eye !
this is the worst breakup in the history of the world !
oh , my god !
how many have you had ?
i don &apos;t know . a million !
chandler , easy , easy . go to your happy place .
l &apos; m fine , l &apos; m fine .
all right .
l &apos; m not fine . here she is .
wait here , okay ? breathe .
how do you do that ?
it &apos;s like a gift .
we should always break up together .
i &apos;d like that !
the clothes are clean . that &apos;s the important part .
i guess . except everything looks like jammies now .
i &apos;m sorry . excuse me . we had this cart .
i had a 24 @-@ inch waist . you lose things .
now , come on . get out of my way .
i &apos; m sorry . maybe i wasn &apos;t being clear . this was our cart .
there weren &apos;t clothes in it !
hey , hey , hey , hey ! quit making up rules !
let go ! come on , it &apos;s my cart .
listen , mitzi , if you want it ...
... you &apos; re gonna have to take me with it !
yes ! did you see that ?
you were incredible .
a brand @-@ new woman , ladies and gentlemen .
thank you . i could not have done this without you .

are you sure you &apos; re okay ?
yeah .
does it still hurt ?
yeah .
what a neat idea ! all your clothes match . i &apos; m gonna do this .

excellent !
we ripped that couple apart and kept the pieces for ourselves .
what a beautiful story .

i &apos; m free ! i &apos; m free !
