silas wants me to drop the veil
between our side and the other side .
he will open the floodgates
for every supernatural being that has ever died .
it &apos;s done . the veil is down .
who the hell is that ?
that is my ex @-@ boyfriend alexander .
we should get out of here .
you should .
too bad you can &apos;t .
silas ?
i can make you see whatever i want you to see .
you have no idea who i am .
i will make your body turn to stone .
isn &apos;t she your girlfriend ?
who knows ? i know she was sired to me ,
i know her emotions were off .
what the hell am i supposed to do with this ?
get the girl .
i can bring jeremy back .
i can keep him here !
no , you can &apos;t .
phasmatos , raverus un animun .
oh , my god . i &apos;m dead .
welcome back .
it was our deaths that allowed this day to come to pass ,
massacres performed in the name of
resurrecting the immortal silas .
12 hybrids , 12 witches ,
the slaughter of innocents by the so @-@ called
hero protectors of mystic falls .
they risked unleashing hell on earth for their own selfish gains ,
and today ...
that &apos;s exactly what they &apos;re going to get .
damon , help me celebrate my 17th high school graduation .
hey . you remember my friend lexi of course .
lexi back from the dead .
goodie .
what &apos;s up , buzz kill ?
stefan , you just gonna sit there
and let her enact her ghostly revenge ?
you reap what you sow , buddy .
let &apos;s be very clear .
whatever time i have left here
i sure as hell don &apos;t plan on wasting on you .
got me ?
yeah . got you .
so if you and ric and little gilbert
are all flesh @-@ like and real @-@ seeming ,
that means something went horribly wrong
when bonnie tried to put that veil up ,
and you two are having &quot; dance party u.s.a. &quot;
you &apos;re right .
how selfish of me to be indulging in these precious moments
with my formerly dead best friend .
i should be sacrificing my own happiness
for the good of others , right ?
i should be upstairs grooming my hero hair .
are you drunk ?
i don &apos;t know , mom am i ?
ok .
well , i guess that &apos;s one way to celebrate our supernatural apocalypse .
now care to hazard any guesses on what the hell went wrong ?
i hit kind of snag .
a snag ? a snag is a bad yearbook picture .
you hit a tsunami . where are you ?
trying to fix it .
i &apos;m running into some trouble .
i need to wait until the full moon tonight
to have enough power to put the veil back up .
are you telling me that we might graduate
right smack in the middle of a ghost @-@ filled expression triangle ?
maybe we should just cancel .
no ! we are not going to cancel .
graduation is the most important event of our lives ,
the last ceremony of our youth .
it is our rite of freaking passage !
hell will freeze over before i let anyone cancel graduation .
can you not make jokes about hell freezing over ?
we &apos;re not that far off from that already .
just promise that today is a friend day .
ok . i promise .
i love you .
i love you , too .
go . i &apos;ll make sure no one finds your body ,
but , bonnie-
i know . ok ?
i know i need to tell them . i just can &apos;t .
they &apos;ve been through too much already .
i know child . i was just going to say that
make sure you say your good @-@ byes .
oh , my god .
no grease on the other side , huh ?
you have no idea how much i miss this
and this .
no .
she just got her humanity back .
let her live a little .
hey . you wish .
i &apos;m dead . what are they gonna do , throw me in juvie ?
well , then at least you &apos;d have a place to live .
you both suck .
well , there it is , that smile .
i wasn &apos;t sure we were gonna see that again .
i did some pretty terrible things .
hey . no . no tears .
if caroline was right , we only have until tonight .
we need a no crying rule .
but the crying &apos;s good .
it means that i &apos;m finally feeling something ,
and right now , i ...
i feel happy .
it &apos;s the grill . must be matt .
hey . you went awol this morning . what happened ?
hello , elena .
it &apos;s your dead friend connor here .
you remember me ?
a hidden compartment filled with advanced weaponry .
man has evolved from his days of throwing stones .
there is nothing we can do for you , alexander .
please let us go .
i &apos;m not holding you here ,
although i have a feeling
that exploding contraption will have a hard time parting
with your handsome friend intact .
just go , rebekah . i &apos;ll be fine .
i &apos;m not leaving you .
the soldier connor found a way to siphon venom from a werewolf .
what do you want from us ?
to fulfill my destiny .
the brotherhood of hunters was created for one reason and one reason alone .
vaughn .
got a little message for you , laddie ,
straight from the mouth of the witch qetsiyah .
we want silas , and we want the cure .
i don &apos;t know where they are , so i guess i can &apos;t help you .
huh . well , you know who &apos;s gonna need some help ?
grandma and grandpa jones
in town for the big high school graduation
along with auntie sue and uncle mark ,
matter of fact everybody here at the mystic grill
for graduation brunch .
you either give me what i want , or they die .
yeah . borrowed it from my jarhead friend connor .
shoots wood like lead .
come on , man .
i didn &apos;t kill you .
no , but you left in that well on that island ,
where i starved to death .
there i was , all alone on the other side
till qetsiyah found me
and reminded me of me supernatural destiny--
cure silas and then kill silas , end of story .
please don &apos;t hurt anyone .
i &apos;ll find silas , and i &apos;ll get the cure .
good . get it done .
so you get off on terrorizing innocent people ?
and whd might you be ?
i &apos;m the guy responsible for the 18 @-@ year @-@ old you just threatened .
well , that 18 @-@ year @-@ old snapped my neck with her bare hands .
i &apos;m also the guy who showed her how to do that .
heh heh . that &apos;s ironic .
you must not know a damn thing about fighting
if you &apos;re trying to intimidate a dead guy
packing c @-@ 4 .
this is my bar , pal .
nobody &apos;s gonna blow it up .
go ahead , sweet rebekah .
use your vampire powers to whisk him away .
i &apos;m sure you can survive the blast of 6 of these automobiles ,
but can he ?
just ignore him , all right ?
just think about something else like graduation .
what are your plans , college , travel ?
just because i &apos;m never getting out of this town
doesn &apos;t mean you shouldn &apos;t see the world .
it &apos;s just been settled .
i &apos;m gonna show you life as you &apos;ve only dreamt it .
we &apos;ll start in italy .
there &apos;s a lovely little church outside san vittore in brienno .
romantic spot , popular for weddings .
and then i &apos;ll show you the northern lights in the springtime ,
the simatai gorge from atop the great wall of china ,
every inch of the louvre .
china , paris , northern lights .
it &apos;s a date .
we &apos;ll see it all when we &apos;re done here because we can .
we &apos;re alive . we &apos;re not gonna be stuck
as ghosts in misery on the other side .
all right . you &apos;re done now .
i got you .
i don &apos;t think red &apos;s really your color , bon @-@ bon .
and here i was hoping the ghost of anyone
would have killed you already .
funny you should mention death
because i &apos;m here to collect that immortality you &apos;ve promised me .
funny you think you &apos;re still going to get it .
i told you qetsiyah &apos;s the only witch who knows the immortality spell .
if she was a no @-@ show , you &apos;re out of luck .
see ? here &apos;s the thing , bonnie .
i can &apos;t disagree with you
because i have been feeling out of luck lately ,
but you know who has been getting all of my luck ?
my beloved doppelganger elena .
my shadow self is living a better life than i am ,
so if i don &apos;t get that immortality ,
i may just have to get rid of her altogether .
did you just threaten my best friend ?
i can crush your skull without even flinching .
go ahead . make your move .
so i think there &apos;s some stuff you and i need to talk about .
yes , we do , but first ...
consider it a graduation present .
damon , i can &apos;t take that .
sure you can . looks like it might be cherry flavored .
i &apos;m not saying that i don &apos;t want it .
obviously i want it ,
but that &apos;s the only one .
there &apos;s only one cure ,
and the hunters have made it pretty clear
that they &apos;re willing to kill
everyone in mystic falls until they get it .
elena , take the damn thing .
i want you to take it .
i can &apos;t .
i guess that answers the sire bond question .
you gonna help a brother out , or you just gonna lurk ?
look , elena .
you &apos;re my sister , and i love you
no matter what you choose .
how is it even when you &apos;re dead you &apos;re the bane of my existence ?
so the veil &apos;s down until tonight .
he dies , goes to the other side , and what--
comes back all over again ?
how long does that take ?
what , they don &apos;t give you a rule book over there ?
you know , you &apos;re missing your chance
to weigh in on the great elena gilbert cure debate .
what am i supposed to do ,
tell it &apos;s her choice ?
because that worked out so well .
you know , it &apos;s funny .
those two are in there arguing about how to protect the world ,
and they have yet to address their biggest issue .
enlighten me .
sire bond &apos;s gone .
elena &apos;s emotions are back .
she finally knows exactly how she feels .
and what if whatever she feels is for you ?
she &apos;s the love of my life .
i &apos;d go back to her in a heartbeat ,
but if that &apos;s not how she feels ,
then maybe that &apos;s exactly what i need to hear
to get my ass out the door .
maybe i will move to australia .
i can live in a yurt .
cheers to that .
come on . we don &apos;t need the cure for silas .
he &apos;s a calcified statue .
what was that ?
nothing .
take off your shirt .
elena , there are children present .
fine .
damon , why isn &apos;t this healed ?
because the bullet was laced with werewolf venom , ok ?
hunters are dicks .
we need klaus . we need his blood .
klaus would rather see me die .
plus klaus is a thousand miles away ,
sipping a hurricane on bourbon street .
that wound will kill you .
what about the cure ?
jeremy &apos;s right .
if you &apos;re human , the werewolf venom won &apos;t hurt you .
and here i was so moved by your speech to save mankind .
sounds like vaughn &apos;s awake .
damon , wait !
here .
what the hell are you doing ?
picking up silas .
coming , vaughn , or not ?
here we are !
what is it ?
is where i dumped silas .
closed off to hikers , no food for animals , endlessly deep water .
i &apos;m not following you , damon .
where exactly did you put the body ?
um , let me see .
so i--i dragged his stone ass through here ,
i flung him in that general direction ,
and he tumbled down into those weeds .
i kind of lost him in the rocks .
what do you know about physics ?
what is it ? it &apos;s distance equals velocity times time ?
guess i should have told you to bring some scuba gear , huh ?
don &apos;t you two look cozy ?
so he seems nice .
don &apos;t make jokes .
i &apos;ll laugh , and you &apos;ll fall .
i &apos;m wearing the gilbert ring .
i can &apos;t be killed by anything supernatural ,
so maybe if you &apos;re one who detonates the bomb , i won &apos;t die .
absolutely not .
you &apos;ll blow into a billion pieces ,
the ring with it .
there &apos;s only one way to find out .
fine . ok .
the first rule of truly living--
do the thing you &apos;re most afraid of .
what are you doing ?
i can &apos;t be killed , and you can &apos;t miss graduation .
please go .
no .
run !
what have you done ?
i finally chose one of the good ones .
we have to do something .
if those hunters give the cure to silas--
they &apos;re not giving it to silas .
wherever damon has taken vaughn right now ,
it &apos;s a stall .
because damon hasn &apos;t had time to bury silas &apos; body yet .
and that &apos;s all you need to know right now .
ok . fine . we &apos;re stalling the hunters ,
but damon is still dying .
it was one bullet , and it was only laced .
we still have a little bit of time .
i will go to new orleans myself ,
and i will beg klaus if i have to .
then it &apos;s settled .
you &apos;re going to your graduation .
gradua--no , jer .
i never even sent in my college applications .
i don &apos;t care . mom and dad would kill you if there wasn &apos;t a photo
of you in your graduation get @-@ up .
jer , no , not if you can &apos;t be there .
lexi will keep me company .
you &apos;re going .
let &apos;s go graduate .
klaus , now is not the time to decide that you are over me .
i &apos;m gonna call you every 10 minutes
until you get your ass here to save damon &apos;s life .
where is everyone ?
i &apos;m here .
where have you been ?
oh , you know , making plans for the summer ,
dodging death by vampire hunter .
where &apos;s elena ?
we can &apos;t do this without her .
i &apos;m here !
thank you for today .
i can &apos;t believe it .
we &apos;re actually all here .
we are all here together !
bonnie bennett , are you crying ?
it &apos;s our last hurrah before you guys go off to college .
before &quot; we &quot; go off to college .
i kind of sort of missed the deadline ,
you know , being an emotionless bitch .
the perks of being a vampire--
we can wherever we want to go .
we can choose our own roommates ,
we could--we could get a triple room !
i &apos;m happy we &apos;re all here .
group hug !
uh , i don &apos;t-- i don &apos;t hug .
oh ! get over yourself . ha ha ha !
welcome , parents , family , and friends .
what a beautiful day for graduation .
thank you for joining us today on this special day .
as we celebrate our graduates ,
so let &apos;s get started .
john albrecht .
david bance .
sarah beasley .
not to play favorites ,
but i am especially proud of this next graduate ,
my lovely daughter bonnie bennett .
congratulations .
i &apos;m so proud of you , sweetheart .
thanks , dad .
you &apos;re welcome .
for everything .
savannah davis .
matt donovan .
william duncan .
caroline forbes .
congratulations .
thank you .
matt freeman .
elena gilbert .
congratulations .
thank you .
greetings , little witch .
jeff gillies .
thought stefan got rid of you .
he did , and i spent the night crawling
out of a cement grave .
isn &apos;t that the witch your friend caroline killed ?
and over there , that &apos;s my hybrid friend adrian ,
also dead .
in fact , these seats are scattered
with two dozen supernatural faces ,
all of whom have reason to lash out
since their lives were sacrificed
in order to make your expression triangle .
all they &apos;re waiting on is word from me .
the veil goes back up tonight .
don &apos;t you have anything better to do
than harass me and my friends ?
well , that &apos;s the thing .
i don &apos;t want the veil to go back up .
in fact , i want you to drop it completely
so i and my fallen friends can live , bonnie .
it &apos;s time to pay the piper .
the kol i remember was adamantly against hell on earth .
i was till i was in hell .
now i would very much like to be back on earth .
what &apos;s this ?
it &apos;s me .
i died last night .
i &apos;m a ghost ,
and i want the same thing you want .
i don &apos;t want to be on the other side with unfinished business .
i want my parents to see my off to college ,
i want to decorate my dorm room with my best friends .
i want to stay here , kol ,
more than anything .
then what are we waiting for ?
let &apos;s do it together .
what have you done ?
this will hold you till the dark ,
and when the veil is back up ,
this town will be rid of you for good .
but everything you just said--
was true .
but we don &apos;t always get what we want , do we ?
what &apos;s wrong , laddie , can &apos;t swim ?
what the hell happened to you ?
oh . oh . will you look at that ?
that is nasty .
connor . heh . he must have laced these bullets with werewolf venom .
ding , ding , ding !
you &apos;re not as dumb as you sound .
this was all a lie , eh ?
you knew you were a dead man .
well , you &apos;re not getting this back .
where &apos;d you put silas ?
one more jolt of werewolf toxin ,
and you &apos;ll be dead within minutes .
where &apos;s silas ? !
one slight problem .
you mean this ?
yes . yes , that .
katewood wilson .
i would love nothing more than to get out of here
before vaughn comes back to life ,
but damon won &apos;t take the cure .
he wants it for elena .
all right . just hang on a little longer .
caroline &apos;s calling klaus again .
stefan , we are past the point of hail mary phone calls .
what do you want me to do , stand here and watch him die
or force @-@ feed him the cure ?
stefan !
remember us , caroline ?
there are plenty more of these to go around .
who &apos;s next ?
i can do this all day .
are you feeling better ?
yeah .
so it &apos;s all healed up ?
fresh as a daisy .
good .
yeah . i taught her that swing .
you know it &apos;s not polite to eavesdrop , right ?
hey . i &apos;m short on time here .
don &apos;t rob me of what little joy i have .
anyone seen jeremy ?
ohh . he went to see bonnie .
he &apos;ll be back later , you know , before ...
well , you know .
yeah .
stefan , can i , um-- can i have a moment ?
sure .
this could get interesting .
usually does .
so the other side .
not exactly a party , is it ?
i &apos;ve lived ... better .
you know there &apos;s something else out there , right ?
there has to be .
silas &apos; whole agenda was to find peace
with his one true love ,
and whatever peace is , it &apos;s out there .
i figure
once we &apos;ve served our time for all the bad things we &apos;ve done ,
then it &apos;s just about letting go
and moving on .
and how are we supposed to do that
when the knuckleheads we care about
can &apos;t seem to keep their lives straight ?
yeah .
so , uh , what &apos;s up ?
honestly , stefan , i just wanted to thank you
for sticking by me when i was at my worst ,
for believing that i was still in there .
even after everything i put you through ,
you ... you never gave up on me .
i , uh , i kind of owed you one .
here .
it &apos;s yours . i want you to have it .
no , elena . i &apos;m not--
stefan , the only person worse
at being a vampire than me is you .
human blood is your downfall .
you got the raw end of the vampire deal .
the rest of us will be fine .
we &apos;ll survive .
i mean , you taught us .
you deserve whatever you want out of life .
you deserve this .
how &apos;d you get here so fast ?
i was already on my way .
i received your graduation announcement .
it &apos;s very subtle .
i assume you &apos;re expecting cash .
that or a mini fridge .
i had considered offering you a first @-@ class ticket
to join me in new orleans ,
but i knew what your answer would be ,
so i opted for something i knew you would accept .
tyler is now free to return to mystic falls .
what ?
he &apos;s your first love .
i intend to be your last ,
however long it takes .
congratulations , caroline .
let &apos;s get out of here before 12 angry hybrids
decide to pick a fight .
i wanted to apologize .
good .
let me finish . i said i wanted to ,
and then a realized i &apos;m not sorry .
you would rather die than be human ,
and you expect me to be ok with that ?
i didn &apos;t say you were supposed be ok with it .
i just said i &apos;m not sorry .
but you know what i really am ?
selfish .
because i make bad choices that hurt you .
yes , i would rather have died than be human .
i &apos;d rather die right now than spend a handful of years with you
only to lose you when i &apos;m too old and sick and miserable ,
and you &apos;re still you .
i &apos;d rather die right now
than spend my last , final years remembering
how i good i had it and how happy i was ,
because that &apos;s who i am , elena ,
and i &apos;m not gonna change ,
and there &apos;s no apology in the world
that encompasses all the reasons that i &apos;m wrong for you .
fine . then i &apos;m not sorry either .
i &apos;m not sorry that i met you .
i &apos;m not sorry that knowing you
has made me question everything .
and that in death
you &apos;re the one that made me feel most alive .
you &apos;ve been a terrible person .
you made all the wrong choices ,
and of all the choices that i have made ,
this will prove to be the worst one ,
but i am not sorry that i &apos;m in love with you .
i love you , damon .
i love you .
now who &apos;s eavesdropping ?
stefan .
think the quarry will be deep enough to bury silas ?
yeah . i don &apos;t think anyone &apos;s gonna stumble on him there .
yeah .
you want me to , uh--
no . it &apos;s all right . i got lexi coming with me .
right .
hey , damon .
yeah .
i &apos;m not happy about elena ...
but i &apos;m not not happy for you either .
i just want you to know that .
thanks , brother .
i needed to see you .
i need to close the veil , jer .
the hybrids and the hunters--
i get it .
i &apos;m ready .
i just wanted to be with you when it happened .
did you and elena--
i can &apos;t--i can &apos;t say good to her .
we said no tears , and i left her a letter .
she &apos;ll find it when all this is over .
i &apos;m ready .
moon &apos;s full .
yeah .
where &apos;s elena ?
she went to find bonnie and jeremy .
she &apos;s worried about the time .
what ?
you got the girl , man .
i got the girl .
now don &apos;t screw it up .
well , with you looking over my shoulder ,
how can i ?
new york ?
too close .
ohh ! vegas !
oh . no . too touristy .
look . i know you think i &apos;m joking ,
but you are leaving .
you just graduated for the millionth time .
it &apos;s time to start living your life .
what if elena was the one ?
she was ,
and she will always be an epic love .
contrary to popular belief ,
there are actually multiple ones ,
especially for a vampire .
the only way to find another is to let go
and move on .
never been to portland .
see you , lexi .
bonnie , jer , are you guys here ?
well , well .
speaking of unfinished business .
happy graduation , cupcake .
it &apos;s almost closed .
so this is it ?
because there were a million things i wanted to say to you ,
but now nothing seems quite right .
then don &apos;t say anything .
what &apos;s happening ?
oh , my god .
what is it ?
it worked , jer .
i did a spell that brought you back .
i didn &apos;t think it would work ,
but i--i closed the veil ,
and you &apos;re still here .
wait . i &apos;m alive ?
i can &apos;t feel your hand .
what &apos;s going on , bonnie ?
why can &apos;t i feel you ?
it &apos;s ok .
bonnie , what did you do ?
i have the witches
and my grams .
you can see ghosts .
we can talk whenever we want .
no . no ! no ! you can &apos;t be dead !
do me this one favor .
tell elena and caroline that
i &apos;m spending the summer with my mom .
i can &apos;t .
they need to know .
you know , the first time in forever , my friends are ok .
i don &apos;t want to take that from them .
i &apos;m gonna be ok .
i promise .
what are you doing here ?
i just wanted to see if you were ok .
rough day and whatnot .
thanks . look . i &apos;d invite you in ,
but i promised tyler
i was gonna keep this a low @-@ vampire zone .
i know that we were under duress today ,
so whatever , you know , plans that we were making ,
in understand if you don &apos;t want to .
you and i , this isn &apos;t gonna work .
i need to keep my love life
a low @-@ vampire zone , too , ok ?
of course . i get it .
so whatever happens on the road
stays on the road , all right ?
that little wedding town in italy ,
don &apos;t get any ideas about turning me into a vampire
so we can live eternally ever after ,
you know what i mean ?
i &apos;m sorry . are you saying that--
i &apos;ve never set one foot outside of this town ,
i have no college plans ,
no idea what the future holds for me ,
but i do know that it &apos;s time that i start truly living ,
and since you almost killed me this year ,
i figure it &apos;s your obligation to show me how .
ok .
what are you doing ?
would you believe i &apos;m having a bad day ?
it started when bonnie denied me my silas @-@ like immortality .
of course because katherine pierce can &apos;t be happy
with good old vampire @-@ caliber immortality .
i deserved it .
i never had a graduation or a prom
or , you know , a life ,
but you did .
you have everything ,
and it &apos;s not because you &apos;re a good little girl
who deserves happiness .
it &apos;s because you stole mine .
i stole your happiness ?
you killed my brother .
i &apos;ll admit that was nasty .
i have nothing ...
but i &apos;m about to change that .
oh , kicking someone while they &apos;re down .
classy till the end , katherine .
your end .
you deserve whatever you want out of life .
you deserve this .
listen . i &apos;m glad you &apos;re ok with who you are now ,
but every single thing i did to get this
i did for you .
so that the choice of whether you wanted to be a vampire or not
would always be yours .
bye @-@ bye , little girl .
have a nice human life , katherine .
don &apos;t bother . i &apos;m not there anymore .
silas .
you were stone . they saw you .
the spell worked .
that &apos;s the funny thing about spells .
they &apos;re bound by nature ,
and nature demands balance ,
so every spell has a loophole .
the spell that turned me to stone
was bound by a witch , a living witch ,
so when that witch died ,
the spell broke .
bonnie .
bonnie &apos;s not dead .
it doesn &apos;t matter , does it ?
and here &apos;s where the mystery of me comes full circle .
i created the immortality spell 2,000 years ago .
i could never die ,
so nature needed to find a balance ,
a version of me that could die ,
a shadow self ,
a doppelganger .
so this is finally your real face ?
you &apos;re another one of them ?
not exactly .
hello , my shadow self .
do you have any idea what it &apos;s like to starve for 2,000 years ?
