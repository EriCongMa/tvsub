i need something on a dr. randall booth ,
we need to kneecap him .
he was beaten with a baseball bat .
what ?
and your fingerprints were found at the scene .
so what &apos;d you do with my bat ?
i took it .
blake calamar .
when he wasn &apos;t protecting bond &amp; associate interests ,
he was out protecting baltimore &apos;s biggest meth gang .
if i were you , i &apos;d be careful .
so it is 76 degrees .
how nice for you .
here , it &apos;s a balmy ten degrees ,
but it &apos;s going to get chilly tonight .
so , anyway ,
i was supposed to fly in today for these depositions ,
but o &apos;hare is all messed up .
i just need you to carry the ball--
all routine depositions , nothing contentious .
sure . what &apos;s the case ?
patric edelstein .
get will .
you know sleuthway.com ?
uh , yes , i do .
kid &apos;s a billionaire ,
a mark zuckerberg in the making .
$ 4.2 billion in assets .
have you been following what &apos;s going on with this movie ?
the one about him ?
yes , he says it &apos;s untrue .
it is untrue and defamatory , and he wants to sue .
he knows how hard it is to prove defamation ?
he does .
he &apos;s suing because he wants the world to know he &apos;s suing .
so , what , it &apos;s a crusade ?
mm , $ 3.2 million in billable hours ,
a very lucrative one .
this is a new side of you .
you used to be into guantanamo detainees .
yeah , that was before alimony .
patric edelstein ?
yes , but she only wants to rent us for the week .
so i don &apos;t get it .
he &apos;s in silicon valley , the studio &apos;s in l.a. ,
and the depos are here ?
viola is forum @-@ shopping .
illinois is friendlier to defamation .
it &apos;s not friendly enough .
we lost the duke rosco case last year .
but that &apos;s why she thought of us .
we were the ones who got the closest .
who was the associate on the rosco case ?
cary .
alicia , too , i think .
i &apos;ll get her on it and we &apos;ll talk later .
by the way ,
i &apos;m thinking of bringing him back .
cary .
really , how &apos;s that work ?
he &apos;s burned a few too many bridges , hasn &apos;t he ?
repairable bridges , i would think .
some bridges aren &apos;t so easily repaired .
let &apos;s not fight , dear .
let me think about it .
alicia , hey .
uh , sorry to bother you at lunch ,
but something pretty big came up .
can you come by my office when you get back ?
um , will , i &apos;m not at lunch .
someone &apos;s in trouble .
i &apos;m so sorry .
you &apos;re gone .
i completely forgot .
no , no .
uh , it &apos;s just a week . i &apos;ll be back monday .
was there something you needed ?
uh , nothing , some defamation suit--
same as the duke rosco case last year .
don &apos;t worry , i got it .
have fun . where are you again ?
well , right now oregon , but it &apos;s not for fun .
hey .
i &apos;m helping my brother move to chicago ,
so if you need anything , i ...
hello ?
what do you mean ,
it is not for fun ?
i was talking to work .
will , will gardner-- that name again ,
like a guilty little computer
churning out the same name , &quot; will , will , will . &quot;
he &apos;s my boss .
oh , i know .
the sultry @-@ eyed will .
he does not have sultry eyes .
what are sultry eyes , anyway ?
oh , that &apos;s it ,
you caught him exactly .
hey ,
look , first state .
you know ,
you &apos;re getting less and less subtle changing your subjects .
i think we should take a minute
and talk about this will some more .
you going to miss kevin ?
nope .
i like new beginnings .
but i did like oregon .
why is it that all your music is gospel ?
come on .
come on !
mr. edelstein ?
mr. edelstein , are you with us ?
yes . sorry . what was the question ?
you were in the midst of discussing damages .
actually , i think he was in the midst
of discussing the emotional toll .
yes , this movie--
it shows me creating my web site so that i could pick up girls ,
despite the fact that i was engaged to be married
and had no interest in picking up girls .
it shows several of my friends
referring to me as a creep and a jerk ,
despite the fact these friends were inventions ,
and what &apos;s worse , it shows me ... being a creep and a jerk .
it would have been one thing if i was
a politician or a celebrity .
then people have other portrayals and articles
to compare it to , but they don &apos;t .
they have this movie and they think it &apos;s true .
are you saying that you are not a public figure , mr. edelstein ?
i think that &apos;s exactly ...
shall we let mr. edelstein answer ?
look , i know the legal point here .
if i &apos;m not a public figure , then my lawyers
only need to prove negligence , not malice .
ah . i &apos;ve been reading the law .
it doesn &apos;t make as much sense as code ,
but i get it .
i &apos;m a 25 @-@ year @-@ old computer programmer .
i &apos;ve never sought the spotlight .
i don &apos;t want anything but to do my job .
i &apos;m not a public figure and , uh , i don &apos;t want to be one .
i sympathize , mr. edelstein , i do ,
but this is a movie .
it doesn &apos;t pretend to be a documentary .
it is an imaginative recreation of events .
well , then they should have made up a name .
they shouldn &apos;t have used mine .
you &apos;re good .
thanks .
when do you want me back ?
actually , that &apos;s it , we &apos;re done .
no , the rest of the depositions .
mr. edelstein ,
these depositions are pretty boring
and they &apos;ll take the whole week .
you know , my mom got a call last week
from my eighth grade teacher .
i loved my eighth grade teacher-- mrs. hart .
she said she just saw the movie and was worried
that money was turning me into a jerk .
i don &apos;t get those calls .
my mom does .
i &apos;ll be here this whole week because this matters to me .
be back at 2 : 00 .
won &apos;t work to argue that he &apos;s a private figure , will it ?
no , it doesn &apos;t matter that he didn &apos;t pursue the public eye .
the public eye pursued him , so he &apos;s a public figure .
they can pretty much write anything they want about him .
it &apos;s too bad .
i like him .
cary , what &apos;s up ?
ms. sharma .
ms. sharma , thanks for coming by .
i &apos;m andrew wiley ; i &apos;ve been put in charge of the investigation .
i just have a few questions for you .
uh , what investigation ?
the beating of dr. booth ,
a wisconsin psychiatrist who was testifying
in a lockhart / gardner trial last year .
do you have a moment ?
sure , i have several moments .
good . dr. booth woke from his coma .
unfortunately , the person who beat him wore a mask ,
so dr. booth couldn &apos;t identify him .
or her .
i understand that ,
that you were there the morning of the beating .
that &apos;s how your fingerprints wound up on the glass on his desk .
that &apos;s right .
yeah , see , the odd thing is ,
dr. booth has no memory of your being there .
right . we thought that might be from his coma .
so what did you ask him ?
i mean , when you went to see dr. booth , what did you ask him ?
i asked him if he stood by his testimony
and then i asked him details to see if his testimony held up .
see , just one last thing .
sorry .
it &apos;s the nanny &apos;s day off , isn &apos;t it ?
just , um , one last , uh , thing .
it &apos;s a bit odd .
your fingerprints were on this glass ,
but , uh , th @-@ they weren &apos;t anywhere else .
i mean , they weren &apos;t on the doorknobs ,
they weren &apos;t on the chair arms or the desktop ,
but just on this glass .
mm . that is odd .
i wonder how that might &apos;ve happened--
me leaving my fingerprints on just one place .
well , thank you for coming in , ms. sharma .
we &apos;ll phone you if we have anything else .
actually , just one last thing .
that &apos;s two last things .
yeah , one last thing after the first last thing .
uh , did you bring the glass with you ?
did i bring it with me ?
yeah , to the doctor &apos;s office ?
see , dr. booth owned a set but not this one .
this is a riedel h2o long drink glass .
dr. booth didn &apos;t own any of those ,
but i checked with the lockhart / gardner &amp; bond purchasing invoices ,
and they did .
that is odd .
any more last things ?
thank you for coming by .
my pleasure .
cary .
why didn &apos;t you tell me about the glass ?
cary , thank you for this job .
i &apos;m enjoying it , i am enjoying getting out of the house .
don &apos;t you ever do that again .
yeah , she &apos;s not a suspect .
the more you try and help her , the more she is .
mr. calamar .
hey . andrew wiley .
hi .
you want to come with me ?
yeah , sure .
legally , there was no reckless disregard for the truth .
yes , you said that five times .
now , your studio &apos;s movie had a scene
where mr. edelstein &apos;s girlfriend broke up with him ,
calling him a ... &quot; loner joke . &quot;
but isn &apos;t it true that there was no such break @-@ up because
there was no such girlfriend ?
i haven &apos;t the foggiest .
well , as the lead studio lawyer ,
wasn &apos;t it your job to get the foggiest ?
no , it was my job to determine
if there was a reckless disregard for the truth .
so you would claim
that mr. edelstein was not engaged to be married ?
no , i would consider the question irrelevant .
the truth is irrelevant ?
no , the facts of mr. edelstein &apos;s life
were irrelevant .
what was relevant is whether the filmmakers showed
a reckless disregard ...
for the truth !
you do understand these words have to mean something ?
please don &apos;t , don &apos;t yell , mister ,
uh , mister ...
gardner .
why don &apos;t you go ahead and keep that
for the next time you need to ask ?
oh , look , mr. gardner ,
we &apos;re here , we &apos;re in chicago in seven @-@ degree weather .
we understand the need
for some hazing , but is the shouting really necessary ?
it isn &apos;t .
but it makes it fun for us .
very well done .
thank you .
do you need something ?
i want to be your friend .
you ... ?
i have a lot of friends .
you can &apos;t win this .
it &apos;s defamation .
you have to prove malice ; you can &apos;t .
even mr. edelstein knows he &apos;s going to lose .
he wants the publicity of the fight , that &apos;s all .
why don &apos;t you do what we &apos;re all doing--
chalking up a staggering amount of billable hours .
come on , let &apos;s be friends .
okay .
how do you get a tan like that ?
ah , princeville , kauai .
i have a beautiful spread-- three acres .
if you &apos;re ever out that way ...
thank you .
i &apos;ll see you tomorrow .
alicia , sorry to do this to you , but i need everything you have
on the duke rosco defamation suit .
how quickly can you get to a land line ?
um ... soon .
&apos;cause we &apos;re gonna win this .
we &apos;re gonna win this big .
we need to prove the studio not only knew the movie was untrue ,
but they were reckless about the possibility of its falsehood .
and they &apos;ll never admit to that .
we have to prove he was a private figure .
we already tried that .
edelstein &apos;s been written about too much .
where are you ?
the reception &apos;s better .
i found a high spot .
here &apos;s the question
what does edelstein want ?
he &apos;s too rich to want money .
my guess is he wants an apology , but the studio won &apos;t apologize .
wait .
i don &apos;t need the studio to admit reckless disregard .
you don &apos;t ?
no .
i need the screenwriter to .
why would the screenwriter admit to reckless disregard ?
because he wants to .
my guess is the writer wants
to say it &apos;s his story , not edelstein &apos;s .
i think he &apos;s pissed he can &apos;t .
that &apos;s right . that &apos;s what we did with duke rosco .
played his ego .
great . get me the notes from the rosco deposition .
oh , i &apos;ll need to find wi @-@ fi .
soon as you can . thanks .
this is a pretty spot .
yeah .
i &apos;ve been admiring it for a while now ,
out here in the cold .
cary .
what &apos;s up ?
hey .
uh , i can &apos;t . i &apos;m sorry .
what do you mean ?
what &apos;s blake saying ?
kalinda , they &apos;re beginning
to suspect you because we &apos;re talking .
suspect ?
kalinda , please .
i &apos;m not protecting myself .
i &apos;m protecting you , okay ?
good @-@ bye .
歌手 : glen campbell
i need to find wi @-@ fi .
yeah , yeah , there &apos;s starbucks on every corner here , so ,
sultry will is mr. georgetown ?

you kept writing about mr. georgetown .

owen , please .
i need to get wi @-@ fi .
oh , talk to me , i &apos;ll get you wi @-@ fi .
get me wi @-@ fi , and i &apos;ll talk .
all right . look up there .
yeah . they &apos;re both password @-@ protected .
which one has stronger signal strength ?
rotterbear2 .
type , &quot; go to rotterbear2 . &quot;
that &apos;s what tech support gives novice computer users
so they don &apos;t forget their password .
i can &apos;t do that !
it &apos;s someone else &apos;s wi @-@ fi .
right , and you &apos;re borrowing it .
it &apos;s like you &apos;re throwing your soda can in someone &apos;s trash .
it is not .
you are so prim and proper .
we &apos;re in the middle of nowhere .
rotterbear2 is probably some unabomber
who uses the internet to surf porn all day .
well , it &apos;s gone anyway .
you know what i &apos;ve noticed about you ?
you &apos;re willing to do naughty things
if i give you a little encouragement .
look , there &apos;s more cabins coming up here .
keep looking .
now , what is the deal with will ?
he &apos;s my boss .
yeah ... but i &apos;ve seen the way you two guys talk to each other .
that is a ... telling pause .
i like will .
he likes me .
we work well together .
making sweet music ?
alicia ?
i don &apos;t know , okay ?
what am i doing ?
i like work .
i don &apos;t want to screw up work .
are you ... are you sleeping with him ?
no .
but you want to ?
i want to ...
not think about it , okay ?
okay .
look .
free wi @-@ fi .
hey , big @-@ time fbi lady .
i &apos;ll meet you at the car .
all right .
kalinda , i &apos;ve missed you .
how are you ?
good .
have you missed me ?
at times .
look , um , i need something .
of course you do .
do you know blake calamar ?
he used to work for ms @-@ 13 .
i don &apos;t know that name , but i do know ms @-@ 13 .
and ?
no , no , no , no , no .
what happened to the preliminaries , kalinda ?
a girl likes to be wined and dined first .
how &apos;s work ?
okay , ms @-@ 13 is growing .
now , a meth gang is like a shark .
it has to keep moving , or it dies .
and from what i hear , it &apos;s moving to chicago .
joining forces with a local gang .
a entrepreneur that you might know .
who ?
lemond bishop ?
look , maybe we can help each other .
what are you doing for dinner this friday ?
eating with you .
no , you ... you know what i find funny ?
that you &apos;re suing me , mr. edelstein .
i mean , why not the director ?
oh , yes .
that &apos;s when you know
&quot; a film by &quot; credit is a lie .
when there is a lawsuit .
do you want that on the record ?
sure .
let &apos;s get everything in the record .
i &apos;m rand blaylock . i &apos;m the writer .
i had chicken salad for lunch .
what research materials did you use for the scene
of my client breaking up with his girlfriend , mr. blaylock ?
what research materials ? these .
your imagination ?
yes .
if that &apos;s not a dirty word here .
far from it . so you made it up ?
yes , i did what writers have done since aristophanes .
i made up a scene
in which mr. edelstein breaks up with his girlfriend ,
because i felt that it conveyed the truth of a character .
truth of a character . what @-@ what do you mean by that ?
i think he is speaking artistically .
i know . they &apos;re trying to use my artistic words against me .
don &apos;t worry . i will be circumspect .
truth of a character means more than just factual truth .
it means , who is this person ?
how do they fit into a narrative ?
what do you mean , narrative ?
i mean that i am trying to tell a story ,
and i need a character to help me tell that story .
and what was the story you were trying to tell here ?
the story of the internet , this age we &apos;re in .
where people just criticize each other anonymously .
where all these tiny little loners
in their tiny little rooms order out for pizza
and just flame at each other all the time .
or when those same loners blog about your drug use ?
yes , i &apos;m guilty , lawyer @-@ man .
you found it . malice .
this whole movie-- it was just my attempt
at getting back at the internet .
take that , internet !
you wanted mr. edelstein &apos;s character in the movie
to show that the internet was alienating people ?
not just that , but , yes , that .
so it didn &apos;t really matter what mr. edelstein &apos;s
real character was ?
he didn &apos;t say that .
nor do i think that . oh , i have a legal obligation , counselor .
but , yes , there &apos;s nothing wrong with having
a character express theme .
the first amendment protects me
from your stupid , dumb @-@ ass questions .
ah , shall we all take a little break ?
no , i know what he wants me to say , burl .
here , i &apos;m gonna say it .
i don &apos;t give a rat &apos;s ass about facts .
i give more than a rat &apos;s ass--
in fact , every breath i breathe-- about truth .
shakespeare &apos;s truth , tolstoy &apos;s truth .
not this legal mumbo @-@ jumbo .
that &apos;s just the graffiti on a roman temple .
forgotten in a year .
but there was no malice , right ?
there was no malice . none .
you wanted to get back at bloggers
who anonymously criticized you for your drug use
by ascribing those supposed characteristics
of those same bloggers to mr. edelstein ,
but there was no malice ?
that &apos;s right . and you know what ?
god bless america . i &apos;m free to do that .
and you know what else , mr. atticus finch ?
you do the same thing .
you write your own movie ,
making fun of me , my drug use ,
and then go get mr. edelstein to finance it .
what ?
nothing further .
what ? are you gonna go finance your own movie ?
we &apos;ve been going after the wrong thing .
defamation ?
yes . it &apos;s unwinnable .
so why are we going after something that &apos;s unwinnable ?
what &apos;s winnable ?
diane and i have decided to change the strategy
and go after something winnable .
right of publicity ?
yeah , we &apos;ve been going after the wrong thing .
we can &apos;t win defamation .
that &apos;s about intent .
we don &apos;t need intent to prove the studio infringed
on edelstein &apos;s right of publicity .
why is that ?
sorry . that &apos;s owen .
oh , hello , owen .
sorry to take your sister away .
oh , don &apos;t worry .
i don &apos;t think she minds being taken away .
i &apos;m going now .
um , you know , right of publicity sounds good to me .
and blaylock , in his deposition , said edelstein had a right
to make his own movie , and that &apos;s the point .
the studio used him to make money ,
and now they owe him that money .
sam moore v. the weinsteins .
they &apos;re arguing
the movie soul men prevents them from being
the ultimate beneficiaries of their trademarks .
the only problem is , the studio can argue
it &apos;s a transformative work of art .
unless you start to chip away at it .
how ?
look into their product placement .
okay . everybody read , and we &apos;ll get together tomorrow .
be ready at 8 : 00 .
okay .
there were other people on that call , you know ?
i know . i was trying to embarrass you .
oh , come on !
this isn &apos;t high school .
what ? this is medical marijuana .
it is not .
owen , put it out .
it is . i have bad joints .
this isn &apos;t oregon .
put it out , owen , or i &apos;m ...
i &apos;ll call mom .
i &apos;m dialing .
this is mom and dad &apos;s fault , you know .
i had a difficult childhood .
this is how i cope .
i don &apos;t want to bail you out of jail .
you never did it ?
never !
with will ?
will &apos;s gonna be your go @-@ to from now on , isn &apos;t it ?
no . i just ... i like the thought of you trying things
and breaking rules that you never broke in high school .
come on .
i am having wine , and i am very happy .
thank you .
search warrant ?
nice paintings .
thanks .
you want to buy one ?
they &apos;re yours ?
you &apos;re hurting your girlfriend .
my girlfriend .
kalinda .
you &apos;re hurting her by doing her bidding .
oh , buddy , i don &apos;t do anything except for me .
we got a lot in common then .
guys , don &apos;t forget the bedroom .
you see , i don &apos;t mind this--
random searches , hostile questions--
but i have friends
and they won &apos;t like this .
oh , scary .
yeah , it &apos;s funny .
i &apos;m always intimidated by threats
until i search people &apos;s homes .
then i see what books they own ,
and it &apos;s hard to take their threats seriously after that .
i like this one .
don &apos;t you ?
it &apos;s just-- it &apos;s so raw .
you &apos;ve seen our search warrant ?
uh ... i have ,
but , uh , you didn &apos;t need one .
i would have welcomed you in .
we found an e @-@ mail on your computer
to lemond bishop , discussing &quot; ten pounds of office supplies &quot;
here &apos;s a copy .
it &apos;s not my e @-@ mail .
really ?
this was on your server .
yeah . hacked , most probably .
so you don &apos;t know lemond bishop .
no , in my workday i have had dealings with mr. bishop ,
but they &apos;re all legal , and all licensed .
and that is not my e @-@ mail .
what , someone broke into your place
to type an e @-@ mail on your computer ?
yeah .
sure . that could happen .
i like this one .
will phoned me to tell me something ,
but i never got the message .
what ?
will ... phoned me , to tell me something ...
passionate , and i never heard it .
how did you never hear it ?
i don &apos;t know .
my phone gobbles things .
it doesn &apos;t gobble things .
what are , what are you , like , four ?
no , i-- the pictures i sent mom ...
look , that is because you didn &apos;t include it as an attachment .
please ?
can we not talk about my technological ineptness ?
yeah , but how do you know
he phoned if you didn &apos;t get the message ?
i can &apos;t tell you , it &apos;s confidential .
your love life is confidential ?
do i talk to him , that &apos;s the question .
do i ask him what he said ?
do you ask will ... what he said to you ?
yes .
but he &apos;s in love with somebody .
i mean , not &quot; in love , &quot; in something .
and she &apos;s nice , i really like her .
and they like sports together .
always talking about
three @-@ pointer this and three @-@ pointer that .
i know i just made fun of her voice , but
i do think that it would really be a mistake to ask him .
i &apos;m conflicted .
you &apos;re in love .
i can &apos;t be .
happens to the best of us .
what do i do ?
what do i want you to do ?
or ... what will you do ?
which one will i like more ?
we get home .
you ... clean up a little ,
&apos;cause you &apos;re looking a little rough around the edges .
you comb your hair , and you put on something nice--
but businesslike , you know , not too slutty--
and you go to him .
and you say ,
&quot; will , i need a moment of your time . &quot;
and he &apos;ll be like , &quot; okay . &quot;
like that , kind of manly , like .
and then you say ...
what ?
i &apos;ve been watching you for 15 years .
i &apos;m tired of shoving love to the side
and serving other people .
i can &apos;t think of anything more important
in my life right now ,
than the feeling of your breath on my neck ,
your hands on my breasts .
i can &apos;t do that .
it &apos;s alicia @-@ time .
shut up .
good to have you back , ma &apos;am .
did you try to buy
the rights to mr. edelstein &apos;s story ?
yes , among others .
and why did he turn you down ?
well , i imagine he can tell you that .
but he said he didn &apos;t want his story told .
do you know what this is ?
that &apos;s a t @-@ shirt ,
with a likeness of the actor
who plays the part of patric edelstein .
that &apos;s right .
i purchased it downstairs , not a half @-@ hour ago ,
for $ 23.99 .
was it licensed by your studio , ma &apos;am ?
i don &apos;t think mr. preston has the answer to that .
yes , it was licensed by our studio .
and you &apos;re also selling a book
about the &quot; making of . &quot; is that right ?
excuse me , ms. lockhart .
we would argue that our movie &apos;s a transformative work of art .
and therefore impervious to any &quot; right of publicity &quot; claim
by mr. edelstein .
meaning it &apos;s a work of art ,
and not a work of commerce ?
that &apos;s correct .
the supreme court has shown great bias
for free , non @-@ commercial expression .
thank you for that clarification .
you &apos;re welcome .
anything to save us some time here .
so , ma &apos;am , talk to me about
the product placement in the movie .
objection . that &apos;s irrelevant to this deposition .
shall we let the court determine what &apos;s what , mr. preston ?
ma &apos;am , could you tell me how many companies
placed their products in your movie ?
twenty @-@ three .
my goodness . that &apos;s a lot of artistic expression to divvy up .
and how many products did these 23 companies place in the movie ?
i &apos;d like to call a halt to these proceedings
till after lunch . thank you .
that was fun .
the last thing they &apos;ll want to do is open their books .
thank you . both of you .
you &apos;re , uh , making this an entertaining ride .
trying to give you your money &apos;s worth .
oh , no .
how dare you .
what &apos;s wrong , viola ?
sit down .
you &apos;re stealing him !
you are trying to steal edelstein .
what are you talking about ?
i told you it was a loser .
i shared the wealth ,
i could &apos;ve shared it with anybody in chicago !
we &apos;re trying to win a case for your client , viola .
oh , no !
don &apos;t , don &apos;t try to turn it noble .
you are showing off for him .
and what &apos;s worse ,
i have to hear it from preston .
i have to hear it from the opposition !
you heard it from our opposition
because he &apos;s afraid we &apos;re beating him .
just ... go to hell !
it &apos;s no wonder that they call you
an ice queen behind your back .
where is this coming from , viola ?
i &apos;ve been nothing but straightforward with you--
you &apos;ve been nothing but a conniving bitch !
and another thing .
you &apos;re fired .
ms. walsh ...
you &apos;re fired .
thank you for coming in , mr. abaire .
and you &apos;ve worked for your automotive company for how long ?
ten happy years .
our tin anniversary .
and you work in their product integration department ?
yes .
and you negotiated with the studio
to have your automobiles placed in their movie ?
yes . the 2011 la havre .
uh , two passive placements , and one integrated placement .
&quot; passive &quot; meaning beauty shots-- and &quot; integrated &quot; ?
uh , meaning there had to be at least one mention of the automobile &apos;s features .
for example ,
our voice @-@ activated onboard navigation system .
and how was this movie sold to you ?
uh ... well , i ... i don &apos;t understand .
was mr. edelstein &apos;s name used
in trying to convince you to place your cars in the movie ?
oh , yeah , of course .
it was between this movie and social network .
would you have agreed to pay the studio
if the movie had been not about mr. edelstein ?
for example , if it had been about
a fictional computer programmer .
oh , uh , no . of course not .
i think we can call a halt to this .
really ? i think we have a few more questions .
you won .
take yes for an answer .
$ 35 million .
and an apology .
we &apos;re sorry .

why do you like men ?
why do i like men ?
yes . sex with men .
why do you like it ?
i don &apos;t distinguish .
you ... don &apos;t have a preference ?
you were saying ?
i was saying ...
italian , mexican , thai ,
why does one choose one food over the other ?
because sex is not food .
because of love ?
or intimacy .
don &apos;t you want intimacy ?
no .
i have to get that .

i didn &apos;t plant anything in your apartment .
you should look elsewhere .
and what about your meeting with the feds ?
she wants me to leave lockhart / gardner , join her .
she knows that ms @-@ 13
is joining forces with bishop .
what does bond want you to fix ?
he wanted me to investigate everyone at the firm ,
see who was a threat to a takeover ,
and who was an asset .

you &apos;re a good person , alicia .
you &apos;re pretending that you &apos;re not--
that this recent unpleasantness has changed you ,
but it hasn &apos;t .
you are who you are .
you ... can &apos;t cheat .
it &apos;s not in your makeup .
thanks for the company .
i &apos;ll see you soon .
okay .
well , uh , according to the lawyers ,
i have to say this .
my patric edelstein is not
the real patric edelstein .
to which i have my own legal one word retort-- duh .
yes , we lost the lawsuit .
yes , there is fiction in every fact .
but you know what i hate ?
i think i know what he hates .
our litigious society and a world
where lawyers find cleverer and cleverer ways
to make end runs around the first amendment .
hey , he called us clever .
what happens to writers
and to satirists if every time they offend someone
they &apos;re sued based on right of publicity ?
he &apos;s not wrong .
of course he &apos;s not wrong .
the last refuge of the loser is to not be wrong .
hey . how was , uh ... everywhere ?
it was good . good !
well , good job on the road .
the studio apologized .
and we did pretty well .
will , i need a moment of your time .
okay .
i never got the second message to my cell phone .
i don &apos;t know why .
the second ?
no , you got everything .
when you phoned peter &apos;s press conference ,
you left two messages , but i didn &apos;t get the second .
i only got the first .
i hate missed connections and that stuff , so ...
can i ask , what did you say ?
in my second message ?
yes .
you don &apos;t have to say .
well , i will .
i said , i think you made the right decision
with peter .
and i didn &apos;t want us to be uncomfortable at work .
okay .
good .
and we &apos;re not .
and we &apos;re not .
okay .
i should get back to work .
it &apos;s good to have you back .
