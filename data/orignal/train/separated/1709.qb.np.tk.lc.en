you work the lunch shift ?
yeah . i &apos;ve got eight pounds of salmon that &apos;s about to go bad .
do you know how to cook it ?
not really .
damn it .
should have liberated the iffy chicken .
what are you and professor fussyface up to tonight ?
star wars on blu @-@ ray .
haven &apos;t you seen that movie , like , a thousand times ?
not on blu @-@ ray .
only twice on blu @-@ ray .
oh , leonard .
i know , it &apos;s high @-@ resolution sadness .
well , i &apos;m going to take myself out to a movie tonight .
you want to go ?
really ? do we do that ?
what do you mean ?
you know , we haven &apos;t spent time alone together
since we broke up .
oh , it &apos;s not a date , leonard .
it &apos;s just a man and a woman hanging out ,
not having sex at the end of the night .
sounds like most of my dates .
oh , dear lord , get away from me , you monster !
what is that about ?
well , he &apos;s smart and crazy enough ,
he may have actually created a monster .
shoo , shoo ! be gone !
what the hell is going on ?
there &apos;s a bird outside the window , and he won &apos;t go away .
that is the hell that is going on .
we have no worms or seeds here .
shoo ! shoo !
really ? on top of everything else , you &apos;re afraid of birds ?
it &apos;s called ornithophobia .
and someday it will be recognized as a true disability ,
and the landlord will be required by law
to put a giant net over the building .
which is unfortunate , because i have a fear of nets .
so movies , yes or no ?
movies , yes .
great . i &apos;ll see you later .
and remember , he &apos;s more afraid of you than you are of him .
that doesn &apos;t help .
no , i was talking to the bird .
go away , bird . go away , bird . go away , bird .
sheldon , just ignore him .
good idea . attention is what birds want .
oh , much better . all right .
now i &apos;ll just get along with my life .
make a pot of tea , leonard . it &apos;s going to be a long night .
the bird &apos;s still there ?
quick , what does a hawk sound like ?
i don &apos;t know--
please , that &apos;s a seagull .
if you &apos;re not going to help , don &apos;t help .
sorry . do you think i &apos;m overdressed ?
it depends on the activity .
for a prostate exam , yes .
if you &apos;re playing vegas , i &apos;d add sequins .
i &apos;m going to the movies with penny .
i don &apos;t want her to think that i think it &apos;s a date .
do you think it &apos;s a date ?
no , but she might think i think it &apos;s a date
even though i don &apos;t .
or you might think she thinks you think it &apos;s a date
even though she doesn &apos;t .
are we overthinking this ?
not at all .
you &apos;re right . i &apos;m fine . i &apos;m wearing this .
really ? a blazer ? all right .
yes , hello .
this is dr. sheldon cooper .
i &apos;m at 2311 north robles avenue .
i &apos;d like to report a dangerous wild animal .
a blue jay .
i &apos;m sorry , this is animal control .
i don &apos;t understand the laughter .
no , the bird is not in my home .
if he was in my home , i obviously would have called 911 .
sir , i have no doubt that there are things that you &apos;re frightened of .
being stuck in a dead @-@ end public service job .
or your wife stepping out on you
because you &apos;re stuck in a dead @-@ end public service job .
or spiders .
don &apos;t you think i tried making cat noises ?
too casual ?
for an audience with the queen , yes .
for an evening of passing a bottle of fortified wine
around a flaming trash can , you look great .
what am i thinking ? whiskers .
oh , hey , if we hurry , we can make the new jennifer aniston movie .
oh , yeah , sure .
there &apos;s also an amazing documentary
about building a dam on a river in south america .
okay , but the jennifer aniston movie has jennifer aniston ,
and she &apos;s not building a dam .
can &apos;t argue with that .
i &apos;ll get the tickets .
okay .
actually , you know what ?
i think it &apos;s about time i picked a movie we see .
you pick plenty of movies .
no . you always picked ,
and it was always the same .
an hour and a half of beach houses in the rain
until the woman turns around
and realizes love was here all along .
come on , that is a great movie , and it starts in ten minutes .
i hate those movies .
no , you don &apos;t .
yes , i do .
the only reason i went is because you wanted to see them ,
and i wanted to have sex .
to this day , i can &apos;t see a sandra bullock movie poster
without getting both bored and aroused .
okay , so while we were going out ,
how often would you pretend
to like things just to have sex with me ?
all the time .
you &apos;re kidding .
does this sound familiar ?
i &apos;d love to go shoe shopping with you .
hiking ? it &apos;s great .
it &apos; 2 a.m. , of course i want to go
to korea town and sing karaoke with your friends .
who wouldn &apos;t ?
okay , we were going out .
you were going to get sex anyway .
really ?
you would have slept with me after a three @-@ hour documentary on dams ?
no . no woman would .
see ? now , that &apos;s the great thing .
we &apos;re out as friends . this is not a date .
sex is off the table .
so , let &apos;s go learn how hydroelectric power
might not be the environmental bargain you think it is .
sorry . spoiler alert .
all right , fine .
thanks .
tickets are 11 bucks .
not a date .
come on , sheldon , star wars .
i &apos;m pushing play . i mean it .
if we don &apos;t start soon ,
george lucas is going to change it again .
this would go a lot faster
if you put your trade school diploma to work
and helped me set up this high @-@ frequency tone generator .
i have a masters degree from m.i.t.
yeah , but you &apos;ve got a can @-@ do attitude
and that &apos;s what &apos;s important .
i really don &apos;t get your problem with birds .
the question you should be asking is what is their problem with me ?
my first memory : a hummingbird dive @-@ bombing my stroller
to get at the apple juice in my sippy cup .
hummingbirds are pretty .
hummingbirds are the vampires of the flower world .
still my first choice for an ankle tattoo .
or a dolphin-- i go back and forth .
age seven , a blood @-@ thirsty chicken chases me up a tree .
age 12 , a magpie tries to steal the retainer out of my mouth .
age 16 , a parrot in a pet store calls me fat ass .
need i go on ?
yes , please . this is way better than the movie .
all right , sheldon ,
your bird death ray is ready .
it &apos;s not a death ray .
it &apos;s just a little ultrasonic blast to scare him off .
trust me , if i had a death ray ,
i wouldn &apos;t be living here .
i &apos;d be in my lair enjoying the money
the people of earth gave me for not using my death ray .
all right , and in three ,
two , one .
that is one tough birdie .
come on , you enjoyed the movie .
i saw you tearing up when the village got flooded ,
and everyone had to relocate .
no , i was thinking how come they get to leave and i can &apos;t .
i &apos;m going to get some fries .
you want anything ?
uh , no , thanks .
are you sure ?
you always say no , and then you eat half my fries .
i just eat the little crispy ones you don &apos;t like .
no , i love them . i save them for the end ,
but they &apos;re gone because you ate them .
and why did i let you eat them ?
to get sex .
exactly .
but this is not a date .
so i ask again , would you like anything ?
all right , i &apos;d like an order of fries .
great . that &apos;ll be five dollars .
i am having the best time .
i &apos;m so glad you suggested we do this .
oh , sorry .
no problem .
what you writing there ?
a screenplay .
it &apos;s about a guy whose roommate is having sex
and tells him to go to a bar and work on his screenplay .
&quot; i hope alex gets crabs : the movie . &quot;
it &apos;s a working title .
i &apos;m kevin .
oh . penny .
nice to meet you .
i &apos;ll let you get back to your date .
oh , no , no . this isn &apos;t a date , no .
right ?
uh ... right .
so have you written anything i might have seen ?
that depends . how much time do you spend on yelp ?
this is ridiculous .
i &apos;m a grown man from texas .
this isn &apos;t a terrifying bird like a swan or a goose .
it &apos;s just a blue jay .
that &apos;s a pretty big blue jay .
one ...
two ...
three .
go ! shoo ! am @-@ scray , ird @-@ bay !
bird in the apartment !
bird in the apartment !
no !
so it is an amazing documentary .
they need the electricity from the dam , but at the same time ,
they want to preserve the environment .
you &apos;re kidding me .
uh , can i see you for a sec over here ?
oh , yeah . sure . just one sec ?
no problem .
what &apos;s up ?
i know what you &apos;re doing .
what am i doing ?
you &apos;re going out of your way to talk to that guy
because i said we weren &apos;t on a date .
no , i &apos;m talking to him because he &apos;s cute .
come on , he &apos;s not that cute .
yes , he is .
with his dorky t @-@ shirt and his little hipster glasses .
i wear dorky t @-@ shirts and glasses .
yes , but when you &apos;re tall and have great cheekbones ,
you &apos;re doing it ironically .
if that &apos;s so , what if i start talking to a girl ?
you should !
i &apos;m serious . i &apos;ll do it .
good ! go ! there are some girls right over there .
what are you waiting for ?
they &apos;re in a group . i &apos;m scared .
sheldon , what do you expect us to do ?
you &apos;re biologists .
biology is the study of living things .
that &apos;s a living thing ; get cracking .
i specialize in microorganisms ,
and amy studies brains .
yeah , neither of us minored in bird @-@ shooing .
oh , come now .
your undergraduate work must have included
a varmints and critters class .
come back in , sheldon , he &apos;s not going to hurt you .
he looks friendly .
i think he might be someone &apos;s pet .
no , bernadette , don &apos;t be a hero !
oh , he &apos;s a sweetie .
yes . it &apos;s very sweet .
now , slowly and carefully ,
flush him down the toilet .
sheldon , the only way to get past this fear
is to interact with it .
just like you did with the mailman .
every year tens of people around the world are killed by birds .
i &apos;m not going to be another statistic .
look how sweet he is . come over and say hi .
come on .
you can do it .
don &apos;t be scared .
come on .
oh , just pet the bird , you big baby !
i did it !
i actually did it .
okay , now flush him .
so , leonard , what do you do for fun ?
i &apos;m ... let &apos;s see .
hiking .
karaoke in koreatown .
any jennifer aniston movie .
hey . sorry i ditched you .
no , it &apos;s fine . you can ditch away .
oh , no , no .
we said we were going to hang out , let &apos;s hang out .
it &apos;s cool . go back to kevin .
oh , he had to leave .
interesting .
so now that he &apos;s gone , you want to hang out with me .
this must be penny .
yep .
i totally get it .
huh ? i &apos;m sorry , get what ?
don &apos;t worry about it . you know , there &apos;s some guys over there .
you should go talk to them .
no , no . i want to know what you told her .
that &apos;s kind of between me and ...
laura .
laura .
oh . okay , i see .
so while he was telling you things , did he mention he owns ,
not one , but two star trek uniforms ?
really ?
yeah . wears them .
not just for halloween .
hey , pal .
you didn &apos;t see me telling kevin that
you thought cold wars were only fought in winter .
okay . then i &apos;ll return the favor , and i won &apos;t tell ...
laura . ...
laura
that half the dirty movies you own are animated .
when you were telling kevin about your acting career ,
did you mention your long @-@ running role as &quot; waitress &quot;
in a local production of the cheese factory ?
did you tell her about your lucky asthma inhaler ?
oh , yeah ? spell &quot; asthma . &quot;
a @-@ s ...
take me home .
maybe i &apos;m not done hanging out with ...
you &apos;re right , it &apos;s getting late .
it &apos;s remarkable .
all that time spent in fear .
and for what ?
he &apos;s magnificent .
oh , dear .
i just realized i haven &apos;t offered you a beverage .
oh , it &apos;s just like my grandma with her parrot .
and after she lost her marbles with her remote control .
my phone &apos;s on the desk over there .
take a picture of us together .
make it good enough to go on a mug , a mouse pad , and a calendar .
if you were a dove , i &apos;d call you lovey @-@ dovey .
oh . who am i kidding ?
this isn &apos;t a moment for strict adherence to the literal .
you &apos;re just my little lovey @-@ dovey , aren &apos;t you ?
guess you gotta have hollow bones
to get some sugar around here .
i still think he looks like someone &apos;s pet .
maybe we should put up posters .
yes . it should have a big picture of him ,
and the words , &quot; is this your bird ? not anymore . &quot;
we &apos;re going to have so much fun together .
you can carry messages to all my enemies .
i can tie a string to your leg and fly you like a kite .
if you &apos;re keeping him , i &apos;ve got a cage you can borrow .
one of the test monkeys slipped on a banana peel
and broke his neck .
it was both tragic and hysterical .
nonsense .
no . lovey @-@ dovey doesn &apos;t sleep in a cage .
no . lovey @-@ dovey sleeps in his very own nest ,
which i &apos;m going to get off the windowsill and put in my room .
isn &apos;t that right , ld ?
no .
where are you going ?
come back , lovey @-@ dovey !
this is your home now !
i already ordered 20 pounds of bird feed off of amazon !
he &apos;s gone .
i &apos;m sorry , sheldon .
how could he do this to me ?
get back here , you stupid bird , so i can love you !
okay . so ... we went out ,
saw a movie , met some nice people ,
said horrible things about each other in public ...
all in all , a pretty magical night .
okay , i &apos;m not innocent in all this ,
but you basically called me stupid , you asthmatic dumbass .
i know , i @-@ i @-@ i crossed a line .
and i &apos;m sorry .
no , no , no , hang on . i really mean it .
and it &apos;s not like when we were going out ,
i &apos;d just apologize for everything so we could end up in bed .
this is a 100 % sex @-@ is @-@ off @-@ the @-@ table &quot; i &apos;m sorry . &quot;
all right . thank you .
i &apos;m sorry , too .
just to be clear , sex is off the table , right ?
way off .
maybe we &apos;re not ready to hang out as friends .
i don &apos;t know . up until the last part ,
i was kind of enjoying take @-@ charge leonard
with a little backbone .
picking the movie , knowing what he wants ,
a little cocky .
really ?
yeah .
well , then , i &apos;m putting sex back on the table .
what do you think about that ?
ooh . maybe i like it .
you do ?
because if that &apos;s what you like , i can be that guy .
i swear , i &apos;ll be anything you want me to be .
good night , leonard .
i am such an asthmatic dumbass .
i had a weird night .
mine was great .
i &apos;m going to be a mommy !
