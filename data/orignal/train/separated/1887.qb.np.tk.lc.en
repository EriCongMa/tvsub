&quot; second opinion &quot;
doctors have never had all the answers .
derek , i don &apos;t know .
it isn &apos;t just a visit . she &apos;s &quot; back &quot; back .
it &apos;s only been two nights .
as long as she needs .
i mean , she lost someone . she &apos;s been through some stuff .
i think she just needs her friends .
she doesn &apos;t want to be alone .
there was a time when you were sick ,
we &apos;d just drain your blood like you were getting an oil change .

oh , thank you .

she won &apos;t even leave the house .
yeah , and ... she &apos;s walking .
she &apos;s even working with her prosthesis ,
but , you know , it has to be perfect .
and i try to be encouraging ,
but then she tells me i &apos;m pushing her .
tell her i say get her ass in here .
oh ... sweet .
then she can be cranky and resentful to you .
we &apos;re constantly having to rethink
what we thought was true ...
and redefine it .
wilson , you stink .
vomit . it &apos;s vomit .
i &apos;m covering the pit , and santa claus came to town .
i don &apos;t need a play @-@ by @-@ play . go clean yourself up .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m doing .
go . you &apos;re disgusting .
what is this ?
what ?
this list your real estate agent sent to mine .
&quot; repair discolored / burned portion , hardwood floors &quot; ?
oh , that &apos;s just some stuff you gotta take care of .
&quot; repair / refinish wood molding in doorjambs &quot; ?
yeah , they &apos;re all scratched up .
there &apos;s like five things you gotta fix .
and what if i don &apos;t ?
then i &apos;m not buying your house .
well , that &apos;s crazy ,
because you begged me to sell you that house .
we made a deal . we shook on it .
we drank on it .
these are reasonable requests . come on , mer .
i mean , we &apos;re friends , but this is business .
we gotta be like grown @-@ ups here .
did you just tell me to grow up ?
i hate karev .
seconded .
oh , motion carried .
we hate karev . what happened to you ?
i &apos;m covering the pit , and santa claus came to town .
you know , i was starting to think that he was an okay guy ,
but he &apos;s just mean .
santa ?
karev .
santa came in two weeks ago ,
and he barfed all over me , too .
he barfed all day .
did he say anything about me ?
santa ?
karev .
don &apos;t do that . don &apos;t be the sad girl with the hang @-@ up .
it &apos;s pathetic .
he slept with heather . she &apos;s not hung up .
why did you start your year
by having sex with your boss anyway ?
&apos;cause he &apos;s stupid hot .
i have social anxiety ,
so sometimes it &apos;s easier than talking .
oh . i &apos;m a really good listener .
i &apos;m just sayin &apos; .
jackasses , all of you .
that was ...
so ...
so stupid .
not where i was going .
what is wrong with me ?
how many times can i say this is not happening
and then the next thing i know , it &apos;s happened ?
i am ... i &apos;m so weak .
you &apos;re not weak . you &apos;re just--
disgusting .
i was a good person once .
a person with willpower .
i have fasted before .
this is worse .
this just feels helpless and inevitable .
like ... like watching two cars head toward one another
and ... there &apos;s nothing you can do .
there &apos;s gonna be a crash .
people are going to die .
and you &apos;re just gonna be left there--
wh--
you are lucky i &apos;m even selling you this house .
you &apos;re lucky i &apos;m buying it .
that list is the tip of the iceberg .
i mean , there &apos;s dry rot--
there is no dry rot .
brian danziger , 17,
he passed out in first period english .
uh , severe abdominal pain , tremors , and he &apos;s hypertensive .
his parents are on the way .
brian , were you drinking this morning ?
did you take anything ?
no , i don &apos;t take drugs .
oh , god ! what happened ?
he &apos;s distended ,
and he &apos;s got tenderness in the right upper quadrant .

a little .
brian , i &apos;m gonna need you to lie back down , please .
oh . alex .
uh , all right .
make sure you get l.f.t.s , coags , a tox screen ,
and an abdominal c.t.
edwards , what do you think this is ?
i think ...
i &apos;m sorry . i don &apos;t know .
that &apos;s all right . we don &apos;t either .
for all we know , this kid could have dry rot .
i &apos;m sorry i messed you up like that , hon .
i start puking like this , it doesn &apos;t stop for days .
well , i &apos;m gonna give you some fluids
to counteract the alcohol in your system .
i don &apos;t have any alcohol in my system .
mm @-@ hmm . last time you threw up all over us ,
your alcohol level was .21,
and the time before that , it was even higher .
it does take the--the pain down a notch .
but i @-@ i swear to you , hon , i ain &apos;t been drinking nothing .
i mean , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s wrong with me .
my stomach hurts so bad ,
and i just get so nauseous , i just wish i would die .
please . you--you got to help me .
well , let &apos;s figure it out then .
okay .
i told you to change your shirt .
what the hell is wrong with you ?
this is what i can offer you ...
salary @-@ wise .
that &apos;s fine . thank you .
you don &apos;t need to thank me .
thank jeff russell .
he really pushed to get you here .
who &apos;s jeff russell ?
he &apos;s the new cardio chief . he &apos;s a good guy .
you &apos;ll like him . or you won &apos;t .
oh , there &apos;s a meeting today about the plane crash with the lawyers .
will you be there ?
i will .
so do i have to come ?
no , i will be there to support my staff ,
not as your proxy .
i &apos;m not your proxy anymore .
all right .
so ...
now here &apos;s your orientation packet .
welcome .
and i &apos;ll see you around .
jamie &apos;s appy went perfectly .
her incision looks great ,
but her throat is still giving me cause for concern .
it &apos;s just a sore throat , right ?
probably just an infection ,
but the swelling is abnormal .
so i want to keep her here another day
and run some tests just to be sure .
of course . let &apos;s be sure . thank you .
yeah .
and of course the kids got to it
before my husband could even try it .
all right , and the judge is tasting it now ,
and we are gonna see what you get , susan .
that is three and a half out of four apples !
hello .
hey , arizona .
it &apos;s , uh , miranda bailey . how are you ?
well , i &apos;m , you know , i &apos;m--
i @-@ i wish i had time to talk ,
but i &apos;m calling for a favor .
i have a 13 @-@ year @-@ old female
three days post @-@ appendectomy
with a persistent sore throat and as of this morning ,
severe swelling on the left side of her neck .
i @-@ i &apos;m kind of at a loss here .
get a c.t.
i @-@ i am . i am .
i just thought you might know off the top of your head .
have you ever seen something like this ?
maybe . i @-@ i mean , i &apos;d have to take a look at the chart .
you know , bailey , i &apos;m--i &apos;m not really back to work yet ,
and--and i &apos;m ... busy .
i know , i know . i just ...
wh @-@ what if i have , um , an intern
bring you a copy of the chart ?
you take a look .
if it sparks anything , you can call me back .
well , can &apos;t you just e @-@ mail it ?
um , not scanned yet .
fine . fine . just send the chart over .
oh , thanks so much .
sir , we have a problem .
you don &apos;t have to call me sir .
i do . it helps me .
sir ...
you need to get your averys straight .
oh ?
in your address book .
last night ...
you sent an e @-@ mail , which i believe was for my mother .
it began , &quot; i can &apos;t sleep . thinking about you tonight &quot; --
uh , th @-@ that &apos;s enough .
well , it would &apos;ve been for me , too .
but it really goes on .
sir , i do not like thinking about you in that way ,
or my mother in that way ,
or you and my mother in that way .
message received , son . won &apos;t happen again .
mnh @-@ mnh . mnh @-@ mnh . don &apos;t-- don &apos;t call me &quot; son . &quot;
i @-@ i meant it colloquially .
that won &apos;t happen again either .
well , i took the liberty of forwarding your e @-@ mail on to my mother .
uh , thank you for that .
all right . sir .
you were supposed to tell me
when brian danziger &apos;s labs came back .
oh , i thought i was supposed to tell dr. karev .
i should &apos;ve told you , too .
uh , brian danziger &apos;s labs are back--
get away from me .
oh , not fair . you are the scariest one .
that was always supposed to be me .
you shouldn &apos;t have left .
i &apos;ll establish dominance .
maybe i &apos;ll use one of the classics .
how was owen ?
you mean chief hunt ?
the husband formerly known as owen is now just my employer .
he gave me the orientation packet .
um , brian danziger &apos;s sedated .
his b.p. &apos; s down a little .
yeah , tox screen &apos;s negative .
his l.f.t.s and i.n.r. are elevated .
did you get a good look at his liver ?
oh , the prodigal yang returns .
we &apos;ve missed you .
yes , hi . blah , blah . pleasantries .
hey , uh , what do you know about the new cardio chief--
jeff randall ?
russell . nothing .
yeah . no one named jeff has ever done anything substantial .
hey , karev , when you buy mer &apos;s house ,
can i get my old room back ?
nope . no roommates .
we &apos;re not in college . we &apos;re real people now .
wait . you &apos;re selling him your house ?
i might not . he wants me to rip out the floors .
i &apos;ll take the floors as is .
jackson .
why don &apos;t you shack up with kepner ?
you guys are always boinking anyway .
where is he going ?
away from you , it seems .
cristina , glad you &apos;re back .
you still doing it with avery ?
does everybody know this now ?
god and everybody .
four whole seconds i was glad you were back .
mm . i gotta go and meet this jeff schmuck .
you were right .
about the floors ?
about the liver .
oh , crap .
you think it &apos;s something i did ?
with karev ?
because things were really heating up , and then suddenly ,
he stops returning my texts .
he barely talks to me , and i can &apos;t figure out what happened .
what happened is , he &apos;s a guy .
so you think we &apos;re done ?
you should be .
yeah , but is he--
leah , stop .
labs for ... santa claus ?
yeah , that &apos;s mine .
what about shane ? he &apos;s nice .
yeah , he is . i wish i liked nice .
well , then you picked the right guy .
karev &apos;s mean .
and thoughtless and a douche .
and there &apos;s nothing wrong with him at all .
karev ?
santa .
23 @-@ year @-@ old female ,
37 @-@ week gestation ,
echocardiogram reveals myxoma in the right ventricle--
dr. randall ?
uh , russell .
sorry . i &apos;m dr. yang .
oh . holy crap .
you &apos;re here .
jeff russell .
make it jeff .
jeff it is .
so ... this is ... great .
well , i understand you already know your way around ,
probably better than i do , so , um ,
welcome .
and go . have fun .
see patients .
i thought we might talk .
i wish i had the time .
dr. russell--
jeff .
i am happy to be back at seattle grace mercy west ,
but not if my progress ends here .
i think my time would be best spent--
dr. yang ...
i am in the weeds .
i have a @-@ a huge myxoma on a pregnant lady ,
i am spearheading the first u.s. lotus valve implantation ,
i &apos;ve got four papers
that journals are breathing down my neck for ,
i &apos;ve got an army of interns who could use ...
who need some ...
who are stupid .
go . run my service . make me look great .
just don &apos;t kill my patients .
who &apos;s gonna assign my surgeries ?
um , you are . call me ...
if you do something really cool .
sir , i &apos;m a fellow .
no , that &apos;s not what i &apos;ve heard .
i &apos;ve heard you &apos;re as good , as capable ,
as excited about this work as i am , if not more .
go .
be that way .
myxoma in right ventricle .
mass measures 3 centimeters ...
at this point ,
it &apos;s about assessing these emotional damages .
so we &apos;ll need to hear everything .
you must be dr.yang. glad you could be here .
have--have a seat .
dr. hunt , i guess you won &apos;t be necessary as proxy anymore .
uh , uh , i &apos;m here more out of support for my staff .
yeah , i don &apos;t mind if he stays .
today , uh , we--we &apos;d like to get some statements about ,
continued physical , but--but also mental
or emotional difficulties you might have suffered
since the crash .
what if we don &apos;t have any ?
well , um , w @-@ why don &apos;t we talk ? we &apos;ll see what comes up .
almost anything can be helpful to monetize your injuries .
how do we do that ?
we use a formula .
it &apos;s , uh ...
your medical bills plus pain and suffering
equal to three times your medical bills
plus flat @-@ rate hard @-@ tissue injuries ,
plus loss of income , plus lost earning capacity ,
plus any other foreseeable harms ,
for each of you .
so we &apos;re talking about a sizeable award .
far more substantial than the settlement they offered you .
where &apos;s all the money come from ?
well , we &apos;re looking at the possibilities now .
uh , the charter company , uh , aircraft manufacturer ,
parts manufacturers , the pilot , of course .
the ground crew at sea @-@ tac , um--
jerry ? did you say jerry ?
who &apos;s jerry ?
the pilot .
he was up there with us .
he broke his back . he &apos;s paralyzed now .
you &apos;re gonna go after him ?
well , if we find he was negligent , shouldn &apos;t we ?
you know , i &apos;m sorry . i can &apos;t help .
um , i &apos;ve got no residual injuries ,
and i &apos;ve gotta go run someone &apos;s service for them .
so , you know , good luck .
folks , listen ,
you have a special bond .
you &apos;ve been through something horrible
and survived it together .
but as far as the pilot is concerned ,
you need to stop thinking of him as one of you
and start thinking of him as one of them .
i am dr. yang , dr. russell &apos;s cardiothoracic fellow .
good to see you back , dr. yang .
have we met ?
um , sort of .
you threw a vaseful of flowers at our heads .
did i hurt you ?
no .
well , there &apos;s still time .
i &apos;m dr. ross .
since many of you will wash out or be fired ,
i won &apos;t waste time learning your names for at least a year .
i will call you by your dwarf names .
you , happy .
you ...
mousey .
there wasn &apos;t a dwarf named mousey .
they saved her for you .
now get me up to speed-- every patient , every chart .
i want to know this floor better than you do .
right .
wrong . you &apos;re surgical interns .
no one should know this floor better than you .
you &apos;re dopey now .
she &apos;s worse than medusa .
i hate her .
i heard that .
so we &apos;re not sure if it &apos;s cancerous ,
but there is a mass on his liver , and it is hemorrhaging .
so we &apos;d like to do a biopsy as soon as possible .
all right . of course .
there &apos;s something else . brian &apos;s symptoms--
the jaundice , the hair loss , the high blood pressure--
coupled with a hepatic lesion , it &apos;s all consistent
with , uh , the use of anabolic steroids .
what ? what the hell ?
brian ...
are you taking steroids ?
no .
have you noticed changes in behavior ,
moodiness , depression ...
shut up ! just shut up ! i said i don &apos;t take them .
brian .
unprovoked aggression ?
don &apos;t listen to her .
he &apos;s not even an athlete .
he &apos;s in the model u.n.
brian , baby ...
just tell me .
if you did it , honey ...
just tell me .
i wanted ...
girls only like the guys
with these crazy bodies now .
i wanted a shot at someone liking ... me .
brian , how long have you been taking them ?
i swear , i &apos;ve barely taken any .
for two years .
since sophomore year ,
that &apos;s when you stopped being my boy .
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m so sorry .
i didn &apos;t know .
i didn &apos;t know .
wilson , what &apos;s the status on our frequent flyer ?
santa ?
i don &apos;t know . he wasn &apos;t lying .
his labs came back negative for drugs and alcohol .
he &apos;s dehydrated , but otherwise ,
his chem panel &apos;s good , his blood sugar &apos;s surprisingly good .
treat him and street him .
i &apos;m sorry ?
santa claus has been coming here for years .
same symptoms--always drunk , always nauseous .
we always run multiple tests , and they &apos;re always negative .
he &apos;s looking for drugs .
give him some antiemetics , give him some food ,
and send him on his way .
i just feel like there &apos;s more to this--
wilson , i know you wanted to help .
but you &apos;re a surgical intern ,
and your skills are needed elsewhere ,
and ... we need that bed .
discharge him , please .
it looks like there &apos;s nothing wrong with you .
you guys always say that .
there &apos;s nothing more we can do .
just like i &apos;d ever get .
yeah .
you have blanket i can take ?
i--i &apos;m freezing to death .
stop .
you don &apos;t get to have sex with me
and then just walk out
without even so much as a &quot; have a nice day , &quot; okay ?
i deserve more respect than that .
what about me ?
what about you ?
i have to stick around and listen to you
compare sex with me to a fatal car crash ?
hear how repellant , how disgusting ...
oh , my god . no .
no , it is not you .
you are great .
you are not the problem .
okay . so then ...
okay , so , um ...
so you know when there &apos;s a dessert train comes around
and you should say no
because it &apos;s not nutritious the it &apos;s fattening .
and you just , you--you know you shouldn &apos;t , but--
but it &apos;s right there ,
and it &apos;s so beautifully made ,
and it looks so good .
and you &apos;ve-- you &apos;ve had it before .
so you just , you know
how delicious it is .
so it &apos;s just right there , you know ?
i do . yeah , i know .
so ... so you have it . you have the dessert .
and it is delicious .
i mean , it is ...
an amazing dessert ...
it is ... really good .
for ... a moment ,
and then you feel tired and bloated
and gassy
and so , so guilty ...
like you just erased all of the exercise
you have ever done ,
and tomorrow , you &apos;re gonna wake up with zits all over your face .
and jesus is so disappointed in you again .
and you just--
are you kidding me ?
hey .
did you send the chart ?
i did , an hour ago .
i told my intern to leave the copies by the door .
well , did you tell them to ring the bell ?
i would &apos;ve thought that that was a given ,
but this year &apos;s interns seem more defective than most .
did you tell me to leave the chart--
ah . speak when you &apos;re spoken to .
yeah . uh , it &apos;s outside your door .
fine .
would it be safe to say that that surgery ,
the one dr. torres performed on your hand ,
was your last hope at regaining your surgical career ?
you could say that .
dr. torres , you &apos;d agree
that with the failure of that surgery ,
dr. shepherd won &apos;t be able to--
okay , i &apos;m sorry . uh , just to be clear ,
the surgery didn &apos;t fail .
it--it worked . the graft failed to take .
th @-@ that was a risk we were willing--
but dr. shepherd can no longer operate .
no .
we &apos;d hoped we &apos;d get 100 % function--
and it &apos;s expected that he will never operate again .
um , i didn &apos;t say that .
but if it is true ,
and you can help establish that as a fact ,
it would raise the award tremendously , for everyone .
no , in my opinion , dr. shepherd won &apos;t operate again .
can we take a break for a minute , please ?
okay .
i am so sorry . i don &apos;t know what happened .
the stupid intern &apos;s gonna hear about it , though .
no , it &apos;s just-- it &apos;s a huge ...
it &apos;s a huge waste of my time !
it is , and i &apos;m sorry .
i will find out what happened to that chart
and get it right over to you .
i &apos;m sorry , but , dr. bailey ,
you never told me to deliver any chart .
when you are spoken to .
dr. yang , listen , if you could give me a @-@ a few minutes .
i really don &apos;t have the time or the need
to keep dragging this out .
i @-@ i respect that . that--that &apos;s fine .
but you were involved ,
and your statement could benefit your colleagues
and their families .
anything you could say might be helpful .
my shoulder hurts sometimes .
i might have had some p.t.s.d.
you did throw that vase at me .
that is hearsay ...
or something .
15 minutes .
dr. yang , dr. russell &apos;s
post @-@ op aortic ulcer patient &apos;s coughing up blood .
did you page russell ?
he &apos;s in surgery . he said to page you .
mousey , suction . set up for intubation .
thank you .
say something that &apos;ll make him feel better .
you &apos;re gonna be just fine , sir .
don &apos;t oversell it .
what do you think it is ?
could be a fistula . could be a dissection .
we won &apos;t know until we get more studies and open him up .
yes !
sorry .
mousey , get a repeat c.t. , stat .
dopey , prep an o.r.
you guys are both scrubbing in . i need all hands .
now .
and someone tell russell that i &apos;m probably opening up
his aortic ulcer .
she &apos;s awesome .
i love her .
get this to path . get us an answer as quick as you can .
got it .
so i &apos;m , uh , willing to compromise .
i &apos;m gonna let the ceiling thing go .
okay , and let the other four things go ,
and then we &apos;ll have a deal .
we already have a deal .
why the sudden need to be a homeowner , alex ?
why the sudden need to be a ballbuster ?
because it &apos;s my house . seriously , why now ?
i &apos;ve been sleeping around a lot with interns .
and you need more space for that ?
i just , i--
i &apos;m starting to wonder if i &apos;m gonna be that guy
who graduated from high school
who hangs out in his el camino looking to nail the freshmen .
i don &apos;t want to be that guy .
so don &apos;t be that guy .
i know . i gotta grow up a little .
so i stopped calling the interns ,
i stopped saying &quot; dude , &quot;
and now ... i just want a place of my own .
you get that , right ?
that may just be the dumbest and the saddest thing
i &apos;ve ever heard you say .
and i &apos;ve known you a long time .
sir .
hmm ?
my mother replied to your e @-@ mail .
oh , dear .
because i forwarded it to her , she replied to me .
oh , well ...
that &apos;s rather graphic , isn &apos;t it ?
yeah , she &apos;s a wordsmith .
i am asking you both-- begging , actually--
that you keep this from ever happening again .
i &apos;ll speak to her .
see that you do .
sir .
wilson , why did you order an abdominal c.t. on santa claus
when you discharged him an hour ago ?
because i didn &apos;t discharge him .
w @-@ well , where is he ?
he &apos;s right here .
hey there .
hey .
excuse us .
you gave him a c.t. and an extreme makeover .
you &apos;re here to do surgery .
i cleaned him up a little .
because poor people don &apos;t get good medical care ,
or dirty people or smelly people .
and if he &apos;d come in a good suit and some cologne ,
we &apos;d all be busting our asses for him
instead of accusing him of scamming drugs .
i thought , if his scans show he needs a consult ,
maybe like this , his next doctor won &apos;t blow him off .
c.t. &apos; s been done . wait for the results .
if they &apos;re negative , you send him on his way ,
immediately , okay ?
yes , sir . thank you , sir .
they &apos;re waiting for us .
you all right ?
you ever wish we would &apos;ve just taken the settlement ?
then we wouldn &apos;t have to relive this over and over .
well ... none of us wanted to settle .
i did .
we all did . in fact , we voted .
then why did you agree not to ?
you know why .
that &apos;s ... that &apos;s not fair .
it &apos;s true , though .
it came down to you , and you agreed .
because you pushed us .
you came in late with your big speech ...
what are you talking--
and you--you did , derek .
you decided and you pushed ...
i did not push you .
and when you do that , no one &apos;s gonna go against you .
how was i supposed to stand up ?
i did not push you .
and--and you did the same thing with your hand .
what are you talking about ?
i told you i did not want to do that surgery .
you suggested that surgery .
yeah , for someone else , for schachter .
i wasn &apos;t suggesting it for me , and i told you that .
but you wouldn &apos;t let up and you made me do it .
because i thought you could do it !
i believed that you could do it .
that &apos;s my fault .
don &apos;t feel bad , callie . it &apos;s on me .
bailey , it &apos;s robbins .
i have thoughts on your case , many thoughts and ideas ,
but i can &apos;t tell if they &apos;re worthwhile ideas
until i read the chart .
so can you send me the friggin &apos; chart ? please .
someone suction for me .
i &apos;ll do it . i can do it .
wait . earn it .
dopey , what are we looking at on the scans ?
it looks like a dissection in the ascending aorta
with an aortobronchial fistula .
good . you &apos;re happy again . suction .
mousey , why did russell opt for an endovascular repair of this ulcer ?
i , uh , personal preference ?
uh , patient &apos;s age and limited mobility .
oh , happy for the win .
keep on suctioning .
it &apos;s a good choice .
but i &apos;ve learned that sometimes ,
it &apos;s better to do things the old @-@ fashioned way .
mousey , hold this back here , like this .
good . what do we see here ?

ooh . mousey coming up from behind .
3 @-@ 0 prolene .
this is gonna be a mess .
i &apos;m sorry , but there are plenty of other houses in seattle
for you not to screw interns in .
this is stupid . i &apos;m calling it off .
you can &apos;t do that . escrow &apos;s practically closed .
not my problem .
neither is &quot; repaint marks on living room ceiling . &quot;
oh , come on . it &apos;s a tiny list .
good . then it shouldn &apos;t hurt when you stick it up your--
i &apos;ve got the results back from path .
it &apos;s cancer .
your scans came back completely clean .
i need you to be honest with me , please .
did you come in here looking for drugs ?
yeah , i did .
can you help me out with that ?
okay . get up . get dressed .
can i just get an aspirin or something ?
i mean , any--
aspirin ? you want an aspirin ?
yeah , i @-@ i get these headaches like my--
my head &apos;s been run over by a truck or something .
and the whole world ,
it gets--it gets louder and--and brighter .
and i @-@ i-- i just can &apos;t move .
migraines .
you get migraines ? why didn &apos;t you say so ?
i tried to . i ... i was going to , but ...
but what ?
what is it ?
so it &apos;s cancer ?
yes .
but the good news is , we got it all .
there is a chance of reoccurrence
if he continues to abuse steroids .
he won &apos;t .
he was perfect .
he was skinny , yes , and awkward , but ...
funny , smart @-@ alecky ...
thoughtful ...
perfect .
then he forced himself to ...
i thought he was just being a teenager
when he changed so much .
if i had known , i &apos;d have stopped him . i swear .
i &apos;d have done anything .
what &apos;s the matter with you ?
change your clothes . now .
oh , yes . that &apos;s it . i have been walking around
in the same vomit @-@ soaked shirt since this morning .
it couldn &apos;t be that i &apos;ve been repeatedly puked on
by a patient who pukes all day ,
despite the fact that i can &apos;t find anything wrong with him
except extreme nausea and migraines .
no , i must lack the ability to wash myself
or have absolutely no self @-@ respect .
you know what ? speaking of no self @-@ respect .
call leah , please . she is unbearable .
let her know if you &apos;re done or bored or whatever ,
because trying to figure it out is gonna drive her crazy .
come with me now .
he &apos;s on the way to c.c.u. all vitals are stable .
dr. yang for the win . up top .
dr. yang , when did dr. russell &apos;s noninvasive tevar turn into
a bilateral thoracotomy with bypass ?
when russell &apos;s stent tore through the guy &apos;s aorta .
and you couldn &apos;t find the time to just ...
consult with russell first ?
yeah , i tried .
russell doesn &apos;t even know you yet .
you don &apos;t have free reign
to just tear into someone else &apos;s patient .
you &apos;ll be gone on your first day .
he should thank me .
he &apos;s probably going to fire you .
still , it was an amazing--
shut up .
hey , hey . uh , you talk to your wife tonight ?
no . why ?
oh , i may have pushed a thing a little too far ,
and now i &apos;m not sure what you &apos;re going home to .
what did you do ?
w @-@ well ...
bailey , what-- what did you do ?
wh--
oh , i may have pushed it just far enough .
okay , you gotta go .
what ?
she &apos;s like a , you know , a little bird .
if we move too fast , we &apos;ll scare her off .
you &apos;re too much pressure now . you gotta go .
go , go , go . go .
okay .
uh ... yeah . okay .
all right . come here , little bird .
i never got the chart .
i am so sorry .
it &apos;s right here .
you know , you asked for my help , and i &apos;m ... i &apos;m happy to help you ,
but i can &apos;t do that unless i have the information .
again , so sorry .
you know , when you say you &apos;re gonna do something ,
you should ... oh .
right . right here .
the pulmonary infiltrate .
i knew it . i think she has lemierre &apos;s disease .
people still get lemierre &apos;s ?
well , i think she does .
you can confirm with an i.j. ultrasound .
now what &apos;s that gonna show ?
come on .
lemierre &apos;s has markers ...
the pneumonia , the complaint of shoulder pain .
and she might have an i.j. thrombosis ,
but we &apos;ll see if we caught that early enough .
but her throat cultures have been negative so far .
yeah , it &apos;s tricky , and we see it so seldom now ,
we overlook it .
you spoke to my mother .
mm . i did .
so there won &apos;t be any more ...
miscommunications ?
shouldn &apos;t be .
i &apos;d appreciate it
if you could just keep it to yourselves .
oh , well , we can certainly do that .
thank you .
if you can .
sorry ?
well , when i get an e @-@ mail that &apos;s not meant for me ,
i hit a quick reply or delete it .
you &apos;ve been running back and forth ,
making sure i hear from catherine ,
making sure she hears from me ,
making sure we connect .
i think maybe you aren &apos;t as upset
as you pretend you are .
oh , i &apos;m not ?
i think you &apos;re glad
your mother &apos;s found someone who makes her happy .
you just don &apos;t want to admit that .
just keep it out of my inbox .
so tell me the name again .
cyclic vomiting syndrome .
it &apos;s been linked to mitochondrial disease .
we see it a lot in kids ...
good labs , extreme nausea , vomiting for days .
it &apos;s a bitch to diagnose so the parents go crazy .
i thought it was the booze i was taking for the headaches .
no , it &apos;s the migraines .
that &apos;s what triggers the vomiting episodes .
but there &apos;s no cure ?
not yet , but now that we know what it is ,
we can treat the migraines .
and i don &apos;t have to live like this anymore ?
no , you don &apos;t .
oh , this works on migraines
and should lessen your c.v.s. symptoms .
we &apos;re gonna set you up with a primary care doctor .
but if this happens again , you come back ,
you , look for us ...
either , dr. wilson or myself .
we &apos;ll take good care of you .
thank you .
yeah . you sure saved my biscuits from the fire on this one ,
doc . thanks .
oh , thank her .
someone else might have , let your biscuits burn .
darlin &apos; ,
i could hug you .
oh , that &apos;s fine .
except you &apos;re a little pukey there .
you know as well as i do , i had no other choice but to ...
let &apos;s wait and see what russell says .
if you didn &apos;t want me here ,
you shouldn &apos;t have hired me back .
dr. hunt , dr. yang , what happened ?
i had to go in on your aortic ulcer .
he had hemoptysis ...
shh . shh .
the patient is stable now .
we can talk about dr. yang &apos;s decision ...
dr. yang ...
thank you .
good save .
and thank you , hunt . you &apos;re absolutely right .
now i know why you pushed so hard for her .
great work .
could you take out your tape recorder ?
i need to retract my earlier statement
or , testimony or whatever .
well , i &apos;m not sure anything you said w ...
i lied before .
i do believe dr. shepherd can operate again .
well , that &apos;s speculation , not fact .
it &apos;s a fact that nerve regeneration is very slow .
his nerve may need more time .
and there are also new nerve connectors we could try
for closer approximation of the severed ends .
that &apos;s a fact .
and we ... we could still try an end @-@ to @-@ end transfer .
we haven &apos;t even tried to take a branch of the m.a.b.c.
you &apos;ve given this some thought ?
yeah .
every single night since you dropped that instrument .
why didn &apos;t you mention any of this before ?
because i was scared .
because i felt like i failed you .
but you weren &apos;t wrong to believe in me , derek .
and you weren &apos;t wrong to push .
in fact , you should &apos;ve pushed me harder .
we haven &apos;t tried everything .
you shouldn &apos;t give up until we do .
all right , listen--
i am sorry , okay ?
i &apos;m sure that you would prefer your booty calls
to be uncomplicated and void of feeling
so i think you should probably
just seek them somewhere else , okay ?
&apos;cause i know this is just sex to you .
and it &apos;s-- it &apos;s not just sex .
i mean , i wish it was . i pretend that it is ,
&apos;cause you have a good thing going with jesus , but it &apos;s not .
it &apos;s not ?
no , and stop calling me a car crash or dessert
or acting like i &apos;m bumming out jesus .
i &apos;m sorry . you-- you made it seem like it was--
and stop acting like i don &apos;t have any feelings , okay ?
i have feelings . i have a lot of &apos; em .
about what ?
you . about you , april . for you .
i &apos;m--i &apos;m so sorry ...
that i hurt them ,
your--your feelings--
it &apos;s okay . just--
i @-@ i thought it was just sex .
yeah , so did i.
okay .
have a good night .
talk to you tomorrow .
i didn &apos;t stay to nail the freshmen .
i know . you stayed for robbins .
yeah , and you know what she told me ?
that i &apos;m a nobody . that i have no one .
she told me that i have nothing to show for my life .
i want your house , mer , &apos; cause ...
i don &apos;t know why . i just--i just do .
the chips on the ceiling are from
the first christmas tree we got intern year .
you wouldn &apos;t know that , because we didn &apos;t like you then .
and the burn marks on the hardwoods
are from flame shots from that stupid party izzie threw .
and the scratch marks on the doorjamb in the study
are zola &apos;s height marks since she could stand ,
and the ones on the other side
are from me when i was little .
i grew up there , alex .
it &apos;s hard for me to change things .
and you grew up there , too .
so before you go
trying to change everything about yourself ,
you got yourself this far .
and you &apos;re fine the way you are , and so is the house .
so i &apos;m not changing anything .
you can if you want , but i won &apos;t .
okay .
we got a deal ?
we got a deal .
what about the dry rot , though ?
would you get away from me with dry rot ?
thank you all for your cooperation today .
next step is for us to file a complaint against the parties .
can we leave the pilot out of this ?
the man is a paraplegic now .
yeah , i agree . we should take him off the list .
wait . no . what if he was drunk
or--or asleep and--
no , we talked to him .
dr. hunt , i &apos;m gonna have to ask you to step out now .
this is only appropriate for the victims of the crash .
okay .
folks , we &apos;re not going after the pilot .
we need to investigate him to make our case ,
but the damages we &apos;ll be seeking will be far greater
than what that pilot could be accountable for .
or the charter company , for that matter .
we &apos;ll be going after bigger fish .
more and more , it &apos;s looking like the best strategy
will be to look for fault with the hospital itself .
boise ?
no , this hospital .
the people who put you on that plane .
all right . well ...
uh , it looks fine .
it can be scary
to find out you &apos;ve been wrong about something .
but we can &apos;t be afraid to change our minds ...
you &apos;re right . you are absolutely right ...
to accept that things are different ...
that they &apos;ll never be the same ...
promise me you &apos;ll take this .
i will . thank you .
for better ...
or for worse .
we have to be willing to give up
what we used to believe .
god ! you scared me .
what the hell are you doing here ?
mer gave me the keys .
mer just sold me this place .
i know .
i want to rent from you .
no , no . i said no roommates .
oh , come on . it &apos;s fine . it &apos;s a big house .
we work weird hours . we &apos;ll barely see each other .
you won &apos;t know i &apos;m here .
the more we &apos;re willing to accept what is ...
and not what we thought ...
what ?
you asking me for help .
well , when you put it like that ,
i want to kill myself .
the master &apos;s mine .
rent &apos;s due on the first .
you buy the toilet paper .
