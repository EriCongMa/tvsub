so i promised to watch her cat tonight .
they carry disease , they &apos;re obsessed with my nipples ,
and they are unwelcome in this loft .

i &apos;d like to put it on you .
what is wrong , jess ?
i &apos;ve been at this new school for a week now
and i still haven &apos;t made any friends .
there &apos;s , like , a clique of teachers ,
and they run the school .
i just want them to like me .
i know it sounds dumb , but ...

hypothetically speaking , what if you met somebody
that you ... that you liked , uh , just as much as jess ?
schmidt , stop .
okay , you picked cece , so let elizabeth go .
initially i said &quot; hypothetically . &quot; so just ...
do you know a place i can get cheap school supplies ?
i only have $ 15
and a halfie-- $ 15 and a halfie .
a halfie ?
yeah , it &apos;s a half .

no one &apos;s gonna accept that as currency .
hey , what &apos;s up , guys ?
did you press the button ?
i thought you pressed the button !
no , i didn &apos;t press the button .
what is wrong with you ? !
what did you do when you walked in ?
talked to you .
guys , i &apos;m gonna go pick up daisy &apos;s cat .
you know , you don &apos;t just ask anybody to take care of your cat .
that &apos;s a very serious thing ,
so i decided .
i &apos;m gonna go over there
and i &apos;m gonna ask daisy to be my girlfriend .
you are ?
yeah . major move !

was washing his size 15 ding @-@ dong in the shower .
and now you &apos;re taking care of her cat .
those are the bullet points , yes .
you know what you got to do
to get yourself out of this situation .
break up with daisy !

what &apos;s up , winston ?
oh , hey , nick .
you know , i couldn &apos;t figure out the best way to kill furguson ,

if only i could get him to leave that damn sunbeam .
you &apos;re gonna murder a cat ?
yeah .
this is a joke , right ?
no .
this is one of your pranks ?
an eye for an eye , nick .
a cat for a cat .
but what &apos;s the other cat ?

also , do we have any meat pieces that might distract a dog ?
winston , don &apos;t do anything stupid .
jess , what are you doing ?
oh , yeah , yeah . cool , cool . it &apos;s nothing .

isn &apos;t it awesome ?
uh , no , it &apos;s not awesome . it &apos;s a crime .
it &apos;s a very stupid crime , but it &apos;s a crime .
hey , do you have any makeup or costumes
that might make someone look like a bush ?
you are about to commit a felony .
oh , my god , nick ! you said roll with it !
you &apos;re not the kind of person who could break
into the principal &apos;s house and get away with it .
you &apos;re the kind of person who gets caught ,
and it ends up on the internet in a funny way .
my god ! that is the cutest cat !
uh , don &apos;t get attached .
okay , both of you , knock it off !
winston !
look , nick , you &apos;re right .
i &apos;m a nerd . i &apos;ve never fit in .
if i met you in high school ,
you never would have even noticed me .
that &apos;s just because i didn &apos;t go to class .
i wouldn &apos;t have seen you .
i know it &apos;s stupid , but i &apos;m doing it .
i &apos;m not letting you go .
oh , you &apos;re not letting me ?

with my old man .
that &apos;s ... weird .
cool .

i think i &apos;m retiring .
yeah , i just want to say ...
i would &apos;ve noticed you .
