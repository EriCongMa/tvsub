my fingers start doing that
after they &apos;re around the wheel all day .

with the money you make , i could buy a fridge ...
with an ice maker .

and are you under 80 ?
you &apos;re in !
what the ... ? when i was a young car ,
i didn &apos;t sit around smiling ,
like i had nothing better to do .

i know a way we can make this
moe &apos;s biggest saturday night ever .
淑女酒水免费
how does moe make money if ladies drink free ?
that &apos;s the beauty part .
this place is about to be filled with guys buying beers ,
hoping to meet ladies .
brilliant ! oh , and thanks for telling me
what the beauty part of it was .
so they pull out my gall bladder , zip me up .
i grabbed a cab ,
tapped my understudy and said ,
&quot; not tonight , honey . &quot;
and here &apos;s the song i killed &apos; em with .
* if this isn &apos;t love , the whole world is crazy *
* if this isn &apos;t love *
* who &apos;s this patrick swayze *
she changed the lyrics !
for me !
then came the bombs :
tobacco valley ,
what color is your tambourine ,
and the smell of music-- but i &apos;m still here .
and i &apos;d like to dedicate this song
to the one great love of my life ,
the man who was my third and fifth husband-- but ...
you never know what the future holds .
huh . not a man in sight .
we got the cheery red tomatoes ,
a bachelorette party ...
ooh ! lady duff !
i am woman , hear me pour !
oh , yeah !

we haven &apos;t made any money .
not yet , but at least we &apos;re hearing
some interesting conversation
from those two book clubs .

was rich and spiritual .
we thought it was maybe a little slow .
oh , well , maybe i can liven it up for ya !

the nrc is here for a surprise inspection .

you &apos;re the head inspector , huh ?
yes , i am .
how come , on your badge , you got a mustache ,
but now you &apos;re not wearing one , huh ?
oh , i was freddie mercury in a queen cover band ,
but , uh , then i got demoted to brian may .
yeah , well , i &apos;m thrilled for your musical career and everything ,
but , uh , we got no way of knowing that this is you .
i mean , we gotta be careful here .
this is one of them , uh , highly sensitive joints .
it &apos;ll take me weeks to grow that mustache back .
or years , to get a new badge !
yeah , well , that &apos;s your problem , ain &apos;t it ?
you will see us again ,
in god knows when .
young man , how do you fit such brilliance
into such an ugly , ethnic head ?
well , if you own a bar , you either keep it clean
or learn to deal with inspectors .
and moe don &apos;t clean .
interesting attitude for a janitor .
what say we make you the new supervisor of sector 7g ?
me , a supervisor ?
i feel like i overdosed and went to heaven !
those smart cars are cutting into our business .
we used to get uber amounts of work
giving people lifts .
i come to america to drive taxi .
now my cab sits empty , like sochi marriott .
well , boss , the main problem is marge simpson !
she &apos;s prompt , courteous and a joy to ride with .
how do you know so much ?
oh , she , uh , drives me to work every day .
and unlike the rest of you cowards ,
she &apos;s not afraid to parallel park .
whoa , fellas , that is not acceptable .
this is a nuclear plant !
huh . no one was in there .
look , moe , the least you could let me do is anything i want .
all right , let me be honest with youse .
after all the money this plant
lost on that nitwit , elon musk ,
they &apos;re looking for cutbacks ,
so i &apos;ve been going over your record .
yeah , the only reason
you haven &apos;t been fired is because your file here
was holding up a sofa that was missing a leg .
well , that &apos;s the logic @-@ where &apos;s the affection ?
well , as supervisor , i can &apos;t fraternize with the , uh ,
uh , what &apos;s the word ... ?
scum .
anyway , because i am your friend
you are safe .
but ... you &apos;re gonna be reassigned .
smithers , &quot; what profit a man if he gain the world ,
and lose his soul ? &quot;
seriously , i need an amount .
in round dollars .
plant watering guy .
yes , yes , go ahead .
uh , and be careful with the venus flytrap .
all right .
they say you catch more flies with honey .
i say , with flytraps .
what do i do now ?
just lean into it .
it &apos;ll be over soon , one way or another .
oh , all right .
hey , guys , you mind if i join you ?
they ran out of beaujolais cru in the executive dining room
and i ain &apos;t drinkin &apos; white with my coq @-@ au @-@ freakin &apos; -vin .
i think i &apos;d rather sit somewhere else .
yeah , i &apos;m gonna take my lunch back to the core .
now they won &apos;t even have lunch with me ?
well , you know , people can
kind of act like they &apos;re in grade school .
oh , now you gotta throw your grade school education in my face ?
you know , moe , you &apos;re a real jerk !
i didn &apos;t mind so much when it came with beer !
i don &apos;t need youse !
i &apos;m all the company i need ! heh !
i just lost my appetite .
marge , which can makes me look cooler
the drizzler or mr. drip ?
aw , your leaves are drooping .
here , let me turn that gloom into bloom .
homer simpson !
working with those plants is great !
it &apos;s helped you get in touch with your feminine side .
feminine ? !
i didn &apos;t mean to use that word !
i @-@ it &apos;s okay to have a feminine side !
it &apos;s good , in fact .
* it was rainin &apos; hard in springfield *
* i needed one more fare to make my night *
* i got a push notification on my smartphone *
* passanger ahead , brings white *
mind if we drive in silence for a bit ?
whatever you want .
* i asked if there was somewhere i could take him *
* he said , &quot; just drive me , lady blue &quot; *
* i said , &quot; i &apos;ve had my share of unhappy fares &quot; *
* he said , &quot; i sure miss slingin &apos; brew . &quot; *
moe , i think we &apos;d both be a lot happier
if we quit our new jobs .
you know , i think you &apos;re right there , midge .
i &apos;m gonna build my bar back up , better than ever !
how hard can it be , eh ?
oh , god , this is so much worse than i remember !
so , you drop off your lover and go back to stealing our jobs .
he &apos;s not my lover .
let the man speak !
medallions !
air fresheners !
step away from the social @-@ media @-@ enabled ,
peer @-@ to @-@ peer ride share platform .
now , promise me
you &apos;ll leave her be .
and wipe down your backseats annually ...
aw , come on !
okeydoke .
now beat it .
uh , i think it might be time to hang up
the old beaded seat cover , there .
yep . and i know a place that could use this smile .
whew ! it &apos;s sure great to see you
jerking our suds again , moe .
yeah , i figured out that the best way
for me to get along with most people
is to be kept behind a two @-@ foot trunk of solid oak .
looks more like poplar to me .
why , youse correcting me on my knowledge of wood products ?
don &apos;t you slide me down the bar !
so good to be back .
oh , shut up .
well , i &apos;m back where i belong , eh ?
you &apos;re not alone anymore .
what the hell was that ?
oh , you &apos;ll find out .
