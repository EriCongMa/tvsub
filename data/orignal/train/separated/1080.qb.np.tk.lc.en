you &apos;re trying to join the pink panthers ,
the greatest thieves of our time .
to join the group you need a heist as an offering .
we have to rob the robbers .
woodford , he &apos;s rumored to be the head of the pink panthers .
本杰明 · 艾普斯坦
i could have you killed for this .
or you could acknowledge the skill
you need for your team . i want in .
i &apos;m pregnant .
we &apos;re pregnant ?
yes .
i want a contract .
the pink panthers for my freedom .
it has to be ironclad .
they promised you freedom before .
what makes you think this time they &apos;ll deliver ?
who says that &apos;s all i &apos;m after ?
everything okay under there ?
yep .
sweetheart , you do realize that it &apos;s 8 : 00 in the morning .
and i love your enthusiasm for wanting to fix things
around the house before the baby arrives ,
but i &apos;m sure she--
or he .
can survive without liquefying table scraps
for another decade or so .
okay . all right .
how much is a new disposal going to be ?
oh , i &apos;ll fix this .
yeah , you watch .
this baby will puree a small chevy by the time
i &apos;m done with it .
really glad to be home .
that &apos;s neal .
he &apos;s concerned that since you &apos;re not around ,
i can &apos;t even brew a cup of coffee for myself .
well , don &apos;t forget .
don &apos;t let the cat out of the bag .
no , my lips are sealed .
elizabeth , hey .
i &apos;m so glad you &apos;re safe .
thank you .
what a nice surprise . how long you in town for ?
forever .
d.c. wasn &apos;t for me .
really ?
yeah .
i realized i can follow my dreams right here in new york city .
yeah , change of heart .
and it did give me a chance to make some headway on projects .
leave this guy alone for two seconds ,
he goes all home depot around here .
all right , i wouldn &apos;t touch anything .
bye .
bye .
i &apos;m talking to david pillar at the bureau to discuss your deal .
you bring down the pink panthers--
i get my freedom .
once and for all .
i &apos;ll let you know what the fbi brass says
as soon as pillar talks to them .
yeah , about that .
i &apos;ve recently lost my trust in the spoken word .
for years i &apos;ve been promised my freedom ,
only to have a technicality or a change of heart
sink the whole thing .
what &apos;s that ?
it &apos;s a contract .
i consulted the finest legal mind i know .
mozzie ?
certainly seems ...
i think comprehensive is the word you &apos;re looking for .
i was going to go with abusive .
if the f.b.i doesn &apos;t sign that ,
then i stop helping with the panthers .
and if they do , it &apos;s legally binding .
i won &apos;t hesitate to take them to court
if they try to find a loophole .
well , i can assure you the f.b.i has no interest
in a scenario that ends with a cross @-@ examination by mozzie .
neal , i want this for you and for the bureau .
i just want to make sure you understand what you &apos;re getting into .
this isn &apos;t without risk .
my formal introduction to the pink panthers is in an hour .
something tells me a bulky geolocating anklet might tip our hand .
remember , this isn &apos;t freedom .
yeah , i &apos;m well aware .
it &apos;s more like a furlough .
he &apos;s clean .
keller .
neal caffrey .
catch of the day .
you &apos;re aging like one of your fine wines , neal .
time , it &apos;s mellowed you , taken the edge off .
caffrey here , he has quite the resume .
why don &apos;t you tell the boys ?
oh , what &apos;s the matter , you got shy ?
you want me to ? i got it .
egyptian antiquities .
he looted nazi art from a submarine .
a fricking submarine , guys .
you know how hard that is ?
those are impressive scores .
then , over time , the f.b.i , they took notice ,
didn &apos;t they , caffrey ?
and he was so good , in fact , that it took them a while to catch on to him ,
but catch on to him they did .
and our boy , here , flew a little too close to the sun .
but he served his time .
it &apos;s good to have you back , neal .
i mean that .
reunion &apos;s over , kids . dry your eyes .
let &apos;s get to work .
mr. caffrey , when our new recruit here ,
mr. keller , heard about your stunt in my building ,
he couldn &apos;t stop raving about your previous exploits .
i hope the past is prologue .
your first assignment .
is this another test ?
penetrating your impenetrable office
wasn &apos;t enough to convince you of my abilities ?
procuring that stamp
is of critical importance to our larger mission .
it &apos;s 19th century , swedish .
looks to be in pretty good condition .
obviously valuable . what &apos;s your bigger game ?
you going to take down the postal service ?
everybody in this group has an assignment .
this is yours .
the stamp &apos;s going to be auctioned by a woman named
bianca esteverena tomorrow night .
you have 48 hours to return it to me .
find bianca .
get the stamp , or you &apos;re out .
thanks for making it out from d.c. , david .
the pink panthers .
every law enforcement organization in the world
has been trying to infiltrate them .
what are they planning ? how many members do they have ?
trying to figure all that out . it &apos;s still early .
caffrey actually earned their trust .
he &apos;s meeting with them now , in fact .
the f.b.i &apos;s number one asset up against
international public enemy number one .
quite a case .
it is . it is .
i have @-@ i have a favor to ask .
oh , whatever you need , peter .
i want to bring all of the bureau &apos;s resources to bear on this--
extra manpower ,
overtime approval , surveillance gear--
whatever you need .
i don &apos;t need any of that .
neal knows this world .
if we get more agents involved ,
the panthers will disappear just like all the other times
anyone &apos;s tried and failed to bring the panthers down .
peter--
neal and i do this with a small team ,
or we don &apos;t do it at all .
this is a high @-@ profile case
with international ramifications .
everyone will be watching you to see how you handle it .
you use the resources we have at our disposal ,
your ass is covered if everything goes south .
well , i &apos;ve never been one to duck and cover
when the ground starts shaking .
we &apos;re not talking about a bad mark
on your year @-@ end evaluation .
we &apos;re talking about the end of your career .
i know the stakes here .
so your favor ... what do you want ?
a signature .
we all let neal down the last time .
made him a guarantee and we couldn &apos;t honor it .
that &apos;s not exactly--
if we pull this off ,
neal deserves his freedom , and i promised him that .
he wrote up a contract .
it needs the attorney general &apos;s signature .
you want to bring down the pink panthers ?
contract &apos;s on your desk .
neal , what &apos;s wrong ?
we have a problem .
look , i don &apos;t know how it happened ,
but it happened .
what ?
matthew keller , he &apos;s here .
he &apos;s running with the panthers .
that &apos;s impossible .
keller &apos;s locked away in a russian prison .
whatever--
i saw him .
it &apos;s him .
we &apos;re going to put an end to this right now .
wait , peter . peter , listen to me .
he had the chance to rat me out and he didn &apos;t .
he needs something from me .
are you out of your mind ?
there &apos;s only one reason
keller would lay eyes on you and not sell you out .
he is setting you up .
but think about it . if keller wanted me dead ,
i would have caught a bullet before i ever saw him .
there &apos;s no good reason why i shouldn &apos;t put him away right now .
are you forgetting what he did to my wife ?
no case-- no case is important enough
to let a psychopathic kidnapper run free .
i have ... a lot to protect .
i will get you keller .
i will . i will hand him to you on a silver platter
when we take down the panthers together .
this could be the biggest bust of your career .
you think keller is the head of the beast ?
he &apos;s a fingernail .
you take him down now , the panthers will scatter ,
and the fbi will never get a chance like this again .
and i won &apos;t get my freedom .
you can protect elizabeth .
get your best agents to watch over her 24 / 7 .
you don &apos;t understand .
it &apos;s more personal than that .
well , it is personal for me too .
keller &apos;s day will come .
you &apos;re damn right it will .
neal , we &apos;ve already been playing in the big leagues ,
but this ?
peter doesn &apos;t call them the yankees of the criminal world for nothing .
this isn &apos;t just any old yankee squad .
this is like the 1927 team .
a team which not coincidentally was referred to as murderers &apos; row .
yeah , i &apos;m up to the plate .
neal &apos;s in the batter &apos;s box , but you , mozzie ,
you &apos;re stuck in the nosebleeds .
maybe if you &apos;re lucky , i &apos;ll buy you a bag of peanuts .
now , scram .
caffrey and i have got a lot to discuss .
it &apos;s okay , moz .
alone at last .
you know , it was a real kodak moment when you saw my face .
what the hell are you doing out of prison ?
no one gets released this early from a 20 @-@ year sentence .
let &apos;s just say i &apos;ve got a benefactor .
you know , neal , some things change , some don &apos;t .
for example , i , uh ...
i know you and peter burke are still attached at the hip ,
or should i say the ankle ?
i &apos;m clean .
technically i still work for the f.b.i , but in reality ,
they don &apos;t have confidence in me anymore .
i &apos;m just keeping the meter running until my time is up .
enough , neal .
if we can &apos;t have an open and honest conversation ,
then i &apos;ll go tell woodford
a more complicated version of our history together .
it &apos;s the truth .
they yanked me from undercover work
and stuck me on some backlogged loan scandal .
banks don &apos;t really like seeing a convicted criminal walk through their doors ,
so the f.b.i cut my anklet ,
which gives me the chance
to build a little nest egg on the side
for when the seasons change .
tell me , why would i ever believe you ?
why wouldn &apos;t you ?
peter burke has violated my trust over and over again .
you know that .
this score is what i need to break free from the f.b.i.
i &apos;m not going to lie . i could use you .
i appreciate your work , neal . i always have .
i know you respect mine .
respect isn &apos;t the word i &apos;d choose .
let &apos;s do this together .
come on , caffrey .
that a boy .
you get those agents approved to protect el ?
two in the front yard , two in the back .
if el goes anywhere , they escort her .
i bet she didn &apos;t get that perk in washington .
yeah , home sweet home .
what about the benefactor keller mentioned ?
he say anything else about it ?
it could be woodford or someone else in the pink panthers .
all right , i &apos;ll have jones get on it .
you can never assume you &apos;re in safe waters
even if keller says he needs you .
you can never assume anything with keller .
i walked into the meeting assuming i &apos;d be tasked with a huge score .
instead , you &apos;re mr. shipping and handling .
you know , you have to admit ,
the stamp is a pretty exhilarating mission .
i don &apos;t think exhilarating and stamp
have ever been used in such quick succession .
my dad and i spent sunday nights poring over his stockbooks ,
magnifiers , stamp tongues , hinge mounts .
wally and the beav ever stop by to join in all the fun ?
you laugh ,
but i still have my membership card to the american philatelic society .
i hope you realize how lucky you are to have ever kissed a human female .
this is the tre skilling yellow ,
a swedish stamp from 1855 .
now , it &apos;s usually printed in bluish @-@ green ,
but someone messed up one day
and made a small print run in yellow .
an error printing .
extremely sought after in the collectibles world .
yeah , well , there are only two of these stamps left
in existence , and one of them was sold a few years ago
to a private collector for $ 2.3 million .
none of my stamps were worth more than 60 cents ?
i wish any of my mistakes were that valuable .
the other specimen , the one woodford is after ,
is being auctioned off by this woman ,
bianca esteverena ,
32 , an immigrant from argentina .
now , her father left the family when she was five ,
so she was raised by her grandfather ,
a professor who laundered arts stolen during world war ii .
nazi profiteers . sounds like a sweet family .
yeah , seems as if grandpa esteverena
taught his granddaughter the ropes of the business ,
&apos;cause now she &apos;s the sotheby &apos;s of the black market .
thieves bring her stolen art .
she auctions it off and takes a healthy cut .
exactly .
the auctions are opulent , organized and incredibly secure .
this is totally secret .
we have zero intel on where these events go down
or what the security measures look like .
we did come through with a warrant
on bianca &apos;s phone records .
she screens any potential client in person
before sending them an invite to the auction .
the text messages we intercepted show
she &apos;s vetting five new clients today .
now , most of the individuals are highly visible
and would be difficult to impersonate
because bianca does her research .
but we got lucky .
this guy &apos;s a different story .
nathaniel dietrick ,
comes from an incredibly private family in orange county .
put it this way-- there are more photos of bigfoot
than there are of him .
it &apos;s even hard to find photos of his family
because they &apos;re notoriously camera shy .
dietrick left california when he was 18 .
all we know is he spent years in the turks and caicos ,
drinking , spending his family &apos;s money .
and doing not much else .
now , he &apos;s back and wants to take over the family business .
the prodigal son returns .
dietrick arrives at j.f.k today at noon .
he &apos;s set to meet bianca in a cafe at 3 : 00 .
he &apos;s not going to be there .
let &apos;s have airport security pick him up
when he comes off the plane .
yeah , stall him with an interrogation .
precisely . conspiracy to commit art crime .
in the meantime ...
say hello to nathaniel dietrick ,
playboy extraordinaire .
don &apos;t get me wrong .
i &apos;m elated that my friend and drinking partner
has returned to the new york metropolitan area ,
but you had the opportunity of a lifetime .
moz , you were only interested in scoping out the art
that i was responsible for .
i can neither confirm nor deny
this baseless yet ... intriguing allegation .
how &apos;s the wine ?
oh , it &apos;s great . it &apos;s really good .
cheers .
it is . bold , brash .
so good ... almost as if it &apos;s lying to you .
what ?
you &apos;ve lifted that glass a half dozen times ,
yet not one drop is drained .
and i should know . i &apos;m a consistent pourer .
moz , i think you &apos;ve lost your last precious marble .
there &apos;s only one reason you would abstain from sharing a bottle with me .
you &apos;re pregnant .
moz .
okay , yes .
we were just waiting to tell everybody until
after the first trimester .
i knew it !
and we haven &apos;t broken the news to neal , okay ?
peter cannot know that you know .
now , i can &apos;t name the parties involved
because of our healthcare system &apos;s
inane confidentiality laws ,
but i have delivered a baby or two .
okay .
yeah .
communication just came from airport police .
looks like nathaniel dietrick &apos;s flight was delayed
and he &apos;s just deplaning with someone else ,
male , 60s . what do you think ?
maybe somebody he met on the flight ?
yeah , or it could be a business partner we weren &apos;t expecting .
give me details on who this guy is .
we need information and we need it now .
nathaniel dietrick .
nice to meet you , bianca .
nathaniel .
are you alone ?
of course i am .
my time is at a premium , mr. dietrick .
i don &apos;t like being toyed with .
why would i toy with you ? my family &apos;s private .
discretion is how we &apos;ve become so successful .
i can assure you , it &apos;s just you and me .
then i think this meeting is over before it begins .
i made myself clear .
the only person i deal with is your father .
fantastic .
airport security just sent this .
elias dietrick , nathaniel &apos;s father .
any chance we can convince him to cooperate ?
i can have a police escort get him here in 1 / 2 hour .
bianca would be long gone by then .
we need someone to impersonate elias .
you--
i can &apos;t do it .
i &apos;m not old enough to play neal &apos;s father .
yeah , well , neither am i.
i mean , plus , call me crazy ,
but the african @-@ american thing might be a tip @-@ off .
come on . you can pull this off .
i mean , you &apos;ve acted like neal &apos;s dad for years .
more like his slightly older , much wiser brother .
yeah , whatever you need to tell yourself .
jones , it won &apos;t fly .
we need to think of something else fast .
all communications were supposed to be between myself and elias .
if he isn &apos;t going to show up ,
then i will have the pleasure of neither one of your company at the auction .
nathaniel , how dare you .
i gave you explicit instructions to wait for me .
hi , dad .
elias dietrick . nice to meet you .
i &apos;ve got this , son .
we were just getting acquainted .
do you mind getting me a menu ?
sure .
excuse me .
please ...
you &apos;ll have to excuse nathaniel .
like many of his generation ,
he seems to have lost his manners in another decade .
i &apos;m sorry to have wasted your time , mr. dietrick ,
but to be frank , your son may have already spoiled the well .
thank you , son , i &apos;ll just be a few minutes .
meet me at the newsstand around the corner .
you sure ?
i &apos;ve got this .
all right .
okay .
lovely meeting you .
i &apos;m sorry we got off on the wrong foot .
i &apos;m assuming you don &apos;t have any children ?
how can you tell ?
you have a glow of unencumbered youth for starters .
unfortunately , mr. dietrick , flattery and come @-@ ons
are a currency that i don &apos;t accept .
it &apos;s not flattery if it &apos;s the truth ...
and i &apos;m happily married .
i haven &apos;t made a pass at another woman in 33 years .
i wouldn &apos;t know how if i wanted to .
marriage is tough , but kids ,
they &apos;ll break your heart .
i &apos;ve tried to sculpt him into the man i know he can be ,
but at some point he has to grow up ,
be his own man .
my own dad made it look easy .
i always thought i &apos;d have the same relationship with my own son .
and then one day i woke up and realized maybe i--
i don &apos;t really know him .
and i wonder if there &apos;s enough time to make it right .
my father left us when i was five .
i never saw him again .
as long as he &apos;s in your life ,
you will always have time to make it right .
ah , you &apos;re starting to look your age .
well , while you were catching up on current events ,
i got us an invite .
really ?
yes , really .
the student is now the master .
well , the master is still the master .
no .
yeah , the master is the master .
always has been . take this .
look , there &apos;s a hitch .
bianca won &apos;t text us the location
until an hour before the auction .
so we can &apos;t run recon beforehand .
we &apos;ll have to run a no @-@ huddle offense .
you &apos;ve already proven you &apos;re not too shabby at improv .
there &apos;s still something about keller that doesn &apos;t add up .
something ?
i mean the fact that he didn &apos;t give you up right away .
he knows i can be valuable to him .
well , no matter how much he admires your skill set ,
there &apos;s no way he &apos;d trust anyone who &apos;s worked with the f.b.i.
that &apos;s street criminal 101 .
you &apos;re a street criminal , and you trust me .
i made an exception .
access to your wine collection
was well worth the betrayal of my principles .
look , sometimes people like keller
get so desperate for the thing they want , that
they don &apos;t notice the ground shifting beneath their feet .
yeah , people like keller .
i can tie my own tie , you know .
you say that every time ,
and every time it turns out like a wad of chewing gum .
okay .
thanks , hon .
and don &apos;t step in the epoxy that you spilled earlier .
i don &apos;t want you to ruin your shoes .
oh , that reminds me .
check this out .
nice !
yeah .
only 27 more projects .
and half a year to finish them .
honey , stop putting so much pressure on yourself .
okay ?
look , i &apos;m relaxed , and i &apos;m the one who has the human growing inside .
yeah , a child .
yeah .
what &apos;s that going to be like ?
someone who &apos;s going to depend on us .
no more quiet nights .
mom , dad .
did you tell ...
no , i didn &apos;t .
neal had to pretend to play my son for the current case ,
which awkwardly makes you his mother .
i &apos;m very proud to have a son like you .
well , a kid couldn &apos;t ask for a cooler mom .
oh , now i could ask you take out the trash , right ?
yeah , and i &apos;ve got some chores you could help me with .
oh , i would love to , but unfortunately ,
i have a black market auction to disrupt .
any word yet , from bianca ?
yeah . i got a text .
there is a location , a private residence .
the auction starts in an hour .
it &apos;s going to take us about that long to get there .
this is why i keep asking the f.b.i. for jet packs .
remember ...
we &apos;re flying blind .
so nothing happens without my say @-@ so .
father knows best .
looks like the black market &apos;s in the black .
where &apos;d she get these guys , abercrombie &amp; fitch ?
elias , a tuxedo is very becoming on you .
oh , well , i used to wear them a lot in my day .
makes me feel young again .
and you look absolutely lovely , my dear .
we will be starting momentarily .
please , have some refreshments .
thank you .
nice to see you too .
i &apos;m starting to think she doesn &apos;t like you .
well , then maybe i should go wait in the car , pop .
maybe you should let me know what we &apos;re dealing with here .
no cameras , light on personnel ,
absence of discernible weapons .
plenty of escape routes . almost looks too easy .
the panthers picked a man to do a boy &apos;s job .
all right , then all we have to do is figure out
where the stamp is actually being held .
well , there should be a secure room somewhere
heavily guarded .
we find the room ...
i &apos;ll distract the guards by acting lost .
i &apos;ll slip in and grab the stamp
before they have a chance to bring it back .
let the bidding begin .
remember , wherever they &apos;re keeping the stamp ,
it &apos;ll be inconspicuous , so ...
all right , all right .
like i said , inconspicuous .
well , this just made things a whole lot easier .
what ? what do you see ,
big guys with guns ?
no .
see the pretentious guy with the e @-@ cigarette ?
yep .
now glance to his right and look directly at the stamp .
you looking ?
yep .
what am i supposed to see ?
keep looking .
the secure room we &apos;re looking for ,
we &apos;re standing in it .
you &apos;re looking at the braxnet a97 .
it &apos;s the most advanced security system on the market .
each unit is independently powered ,
so cutting the house &apos;s main will get us nowhere .
a security cage rapidly descends
if the laser perimeter &apos;s broken .
it &apos;s full of redundancies and backups
developed with the help of ex @-@ thieves .
you &apos;re angry they didn &apos;t ask you , aren &apos;t you ?
they did .
i was in prison .
right .
well , i &apos;ve got to call backup .
no , that will only make things worse .
no ...
you and i are going to walk out of here with that stamp .
how ?
simple .
we just set off the alarm .
we can &apos;t just set off the alarm , neal .
we &apos;ll be sitting ducks .
i cannot get enough of these .
i need-- no , thank you .
i need you to focus .
you &apos;re taking this whole southern california
slacker thing a little too much to heart .
whoa , dad , take it easy , man .
good evening , ladies and gentlemen , and welcome .
the bidding will now get underway .
our first item up for auction this evening
is this magnificent sculpture by benedetto boschetti .
i &apos;d like to start the bidding at $ 1.6 million .
do i have an opening bid of 1.6 million ?
1.6 million . do i hear 1.6 ?
i have a bid at 1.6 million . thank you very much , sir .
1.7 , do i have a bid at 1.7 ? 1.7 .
thank you very much , sir . 1.8 ?
1.8 to you , sir . we have 1.8 million on the left ,
1.9 million ? 1.9 million in the front .
2 million ? 2 million , sir ?
are we holding at 1.9 ?
fair warning , last chance , $ 1.9 million
going once , going twice--
2.4 .
hey , my friend , in case you &apos;re not aware ,
there &apos;s a protocol , here .
we don &apos;t usually increase the bids so drastically all at once .
oh , i am so sorry , amigo .
i wasn &apos;t aware we &apos;re at the penny ante table .
i &apos;ll slow down so you can catch your breath
and count your chips .
if you &apos;d like to compare bank balances ,
i could have that arranged .
but in the meantime , why don &apos;t you show a little class--
if you have any .
are--do you have a plan ,
or are you just trying to get attention here ?
dad , i think it might be time for you
to stand up for your son .
if a fight breaks out , make sure you steer it
toward the lasers protecting the statue .
why would a fight break out ?
because you &apos;re going to start it .
i have 2.4 million from the gentleman in the back .
2.5 million , sir ?
2.5 .
2.5 .
2.6 , and i will throw in a tanning bed
for my friend here with the vitamin d deficiency .
you petulant little bastard .
what , are you going to call your bodyguard ?
now , don &apos;t you dare call my son
a petulant little bastard .
son of a bitch !
enough , enough , both of you .
oh , stop !
everyone , stop right where you are .
just let me at him . i want a fair fight .
cut the alarms .
we &apos;ve got code red . code red .
all units move it . go , go , go !
braxnet security . nobody move .
nobody is leaving this house
until i have the stamp in my hand .
search everyone . start with him .
he &apos;s clean .
as long as all of us are being searched , she should be too .
yeah , that &apos;s right .
bianca &apos;s auctioning the stamp on behalf of a third party .
it would be a perfect scam wouldn &apos;t it ?
why take 25 % when you can get the whole thing ?
fine , search me .
but this is ridiculous .
that &apos;s an empty case . where is the stamp ?
you got it ?
nice work , son .
caffrey , you have a sec ?
yeah , what &apos;s up ?
are you absolutely sure you saw matthew keller in the flesh ?
unfortunately , yes .
yeah , well , then i need some help .
because suddenly i &apos;m very confused .
how good is your russian ?
good enough to know that this is a rap sheet from moscow .
i talked to two people at the prison ,
the captain and the warden , both of whom confirmed
what &apos;s on that rap sheet .
you know what that word means ?
incarcerated .
according to the russians , keller is still in prison .
doesn &apos;t make sense .
unless his benefactor is someone
who want it to look like he &apos;s still behind bars .
keep the tracks covered .
nobody would suspect you of a crime
if they knew you weren &apos;t able to commit it .
if the panthers can pull off a sleight of hand like that ,
they &apos;ve got their fingers in the highest reaches of the russian government .
i have some disappointing news of my own .
normally , we &apos;d be able to use seized evidence in an ongoing case .
but it &apos;s different when the evidence in question
belongs to someone overseas .
the stamp .
i tried to buy us time , but it &apos;s protocol .
the bureau had to report it to an international database .
swedish government informed us this morning
that it was stolen from a private collection ,
and they &apos;re not cooperating .
so what am i supposed to give the panthers ?
nothing .
i can &apos;t have you walk back in there without the stamp .
i &apos;m pulling the plug on this operation .
no , absolutely not .
neal , you can &apos;t walk back in there empty @-@ handed .
you know how dangerous the panthers are .
we had a deal .
you can &apos;t do this to me again .
i &apos;m trying to protect you .
i don &apos;t need you to protect me .
i can protect myself .
is your freedom worth dying for ?
it might be .
i &apos;m taking this with me . little motivational aid .
i gave you my word . i will get you your freedom .
your word ?
i &apos;ll get my freedom myself when i take down the panthers .
this is insanity , neal .
there &apos;s no way you can craft a convincing forgery in the time you have .
exacto .
i have to try something , even if my chances are slim .
this is too important an opportunity to pass up .
you &apos;re not presenting a knockoff remington
to some leather @-@ faced dingbat on key west .
this is the pink panthers .
hair dryer .
if they use keller to verify the stamp &apos;s authenticity--
he might let me off the hook .
or use it as evidence to bury you .
maybe you &apos;re right . i don &apos;t know .
i mean , what kind of benefactor
could possibly get you out of prison ?
and make it look like you &apos;re still there ?
mafia ?
they &apos;re not good enough to pull off the cover @-@ up .
and it &apos;s not the panthers .
i mean , they can steal pretty much anything ,
but bureaucratic arm @-@ twisting isn &apos;t one of their specialties .
who would have the motivation to do it ?
motivation .
get me the india ink and the finest brush we &apos;ve got .
stop .
you got it ?
would i be here if i didn &apos;t ?
he pulled it off .
this shade of yellow is a dead giveaway that it &apos;s authentic .
see , they used to mix uranium in with the ink to give it a color .
it &apos;s impossible to fake today .
good job .
unexpected , mr. caffrey .
icing on the cake .
bianca esteverena is on the cutting edge of technology .
she spares no expense .
the security system she employed is operated
a highly sophisticated firm called
braxnet--
braxnet security .
i recognized the system as soon as i entered .
it &apos;s impenetrable .
precisely .
you wanted me to fail .
and yet , here you are .
the goal of your mission was to test braxnet &apos;s response
once the alarm was tripped .
getting the stamp , a sideshow at best .
we set the odds 100 @-@ to @-@ 1 against .
so you were watching .
we had a small team at bianca &apos;s
noting the number of guards who responded ,
how quickly they arrived , their maneuvers ,
their strengths , and especially their weaknesses .
it &apos;s all critical information for what &apos;s to come .
and what is to come , exactly ?
oh , mr. caffrey , one more thing that my team
noticed at the auction--
a man .
he seemed to be working right alongside you .
who is he ?
he &apos;s a trusted collaborator .
all he knows is i was after the stamp .
he thinks i &apos;m fencing it myself .
look , he &apos;s as discreet as they come .
how long you been working for interpol ?
how did you know i was working for them ?
interpol doesn &apos;t usually advertise
the names of its associates .
didn &apos;t you once call me a rat for being a c.i. for the bureau ?
a rat will gnaw through its own leg
if it &apos;s in a trap , caffrey .
i &apos;m less desperate , more enterprising .
that sounds like a distinction without a difference .
you still haven &apos;t answered my question .
how &apos;d you know i was working for interpol ?
you know , i always heard interpol
had one foot in the future .
they don &apos;t slap bulky anklets on their criminal informants .
that &apos;d be too inelegant , too crass , too american .
instead ,
they insert chips under the skin of their informants like dogs .
it is an ingenious solution except for the pain
at the injection sites and constant , constant itching .
you know what they call this ?
the worst walk along the water i &apos;ve had in years ?
mutually assured destruction .
your collaborator ?
try convincing me it wasn &apos;t peter burke .
yeah .
so you got something on me . i got something on you .
yeah , it &apos;s almost romantic .
until one of us lobs a bomb
and the other responds with the apocalypse .
i &apos;ll keep that under my pillow tonight .
what &apos;s your angle , keller ?
you take down the panthers , then what ?
you do that and your criminal career is over .
freedom , neal .
see , i got the same deal that you do .
i bring down the panthers , i &apos;m liberated .
not even peter burke can touch me .
and the stamp ?
the panthers are expecting it to be fenced .
what are the odds you can find someone stupid enough to buy it ?
i already got a buyer lined up .
interpol .
of course .
you know , i can &apos;t say i &apos;m happy with what you did ,
and i certainly wouldn &apos;t have condoned it ,
but i &apos;m impressed .
and i &apos;m worried .
interpol clearly has no idea who they &apos;re dealing with .
keller would never go clean .
right now we can at least
bask in a little sunshine .
your contract .
they signed it .
w--no strings attached ?
the attorney general came through .
it &apos;s ironclad , everything you wanted .
you help us bring down the pink panthers ,
and you are home free .
oh , no , no , no , no .
you are the one who taught me that it &apos;s bad luck
to do a victory dance before you cross the finish line .
you &apos;re right , i did . but come outside .
so i thought we could puff on these when i do
a security check on the laser fence i just installed .
no , this is actually to celebrate
a certain paternal capacity that has recently come to light .
okay , you &apos;re taking this role @-@ playing thing
way too far , mr. dietrick .
el &apos;s pregnant .
oh , congratulations .
thank you .
thanks .
we &apos;ve been trying for years , and when it didn &apos;t happen
we thought it never would , but then it did .
well , based on the 24 hours you were my dad ,
i &apos;m pretty damn sure that kid just won the parent lottery .
to the future .
to the future .
