good evening .
i &apos;m your guest lecturer , dr. sheldon cooper .
i was expecting applause ,
but i suppose stunned silence is equally appropriate .
i agreed to speak to you this evening ,
because i was told that you &apos;re the best and the brightest
of this university &apos;s doctoral candidates .
hmm . of course , that &apos;s like saying
you are the most important electron in a hydrogen atom .
&apos;cause , you see ,
there &apos;s only one electron in a hydrogen atom .
best and brightest , my sweet patootie .
all right , let &apos;s begin .
show of hands , who here is familiar
with the concept of topological insulators ?
don &apos;t kid yourselves .
i found another tweet from a student at sheldon &apos;s lecture .
&quot; dr. cooper has taken a relatively boring subject
and managed to make it completely insufferable .
plus , he looks like a giant insect . &quot;
look . listen to this one .
&quot; does einstein &apos;s theory explain why time flies
when you &apos;re having fun ,
but when you &apos;re listening to dr. cooper ,
it falls out of the sky , dead ? &quot;
ooh , somebody took pictures
and uploaded them to their flickr account .
wow .
how do you get an entire lecture hall
to flip you off at the same time ?
apparently , if you &apos;re sheldon ,
all you need to do is turn your back .
hey , leonard , is your wi @-@ fi down ?
i can &apos;t get on .
oh , sheldon changed the password .
it &apos;s now &quot; penny is a freeloader . &quot;
no spaces .
thanks . what are you guys doing ?
sheldon gave a lecture at the university tonight .
we &apos;re reading the reviews .
oh . how &apos;d he do ?
well , picture the hindenburg meets chernobyl
meets three mile island meets &lt; i &gt; tron 2 . &lt; / i &gt;
that bad , huh ?
read this woman &apos;s tweet .
&quot; listening to dr. cooper
has made me want to start cutting myself again &quot; &quot;
yeah .
good evening , leonard , howard , raj ,
freeloader .
so , how &apos;d the lecture go ?
in a word , triumphant .
really ? triumphant ?
oh , yes , you should have seen those young people .
thirsty for knowledge , drinking in my wisdom .
i may have changed a few lives today .
oh , please let me tell him .
i don &apos;t know , i kind of promised howard .
tell me what ?
actually , we should all share the moment .
raj , if you would .
oh , tweets about my lecture .
that &apos;s rather unfair .
that &apos;s downright cruel .
plus , insects have six legs .
yeah , i &apos;m not familiar with the acronym &quot; kmn &quot; &quot;
from the context , we think it means &quot; kill me now . &quot;
well , i suppose everyone &apos;s entitled to their own opinion .
i think i &apos;ll turn in .
i didn &apos;t want to teach those poopy heads , anyway .
fyi , i think that &apos;s what darth vader said
just before he started building the death star .
sheldon still moping ?
yeah , it &apos;s weird . even though he didn &apos;t want
to give the lecture in the first place ,
being rejected by those students really hit him hard .
i know the feeling .
it &apos;s like accidentally walking into a gay bar
and then having no one hit on you .
it @-@ it happened to a friend of mine .
are you guys doing okay ?
leonard and i are fine ,
but i think raj needs to meet a girl really soon .
well , that shouldn &apos;t be too hard .
he &apos;s such a cutie .
thank you , but &quot; cute &quot; is for bunnies .
i want to be something with sex appeal ,
like ... like a labradoodle .
labradoodle ?
we might be starting to zero in on your problem .
don &apos;t you listen to them .
you &apos;ve got plenty of sex appeal .
you really think so ?
yeah . you &apos;re a hottie .
well , thanks , bernadette .
and just for the record ,
labradoodles are hypo @-@ allergenic ,
which is a very sexy quality to those troubled by animal dander .
so , what do you think ?
it &apos;s a charming illusion , but it does not cheer me up .
not even when i do this ?
no .
well , that was the last arrow in my quiver of whimsy .
do you realize that teaching is the first thing
i &apos;ve failed at since my ill @-@ fated attempt
to complete a chin @-@ up in march of 1989 ?
if this humiliating experience
is really troubling you ,
there are things we could do about it .
for instance ?
well , the first thing that comes to mind
is isolating the part of your brain
where the memory is stored and destroying it with a laser .
hmm , no .
one slip of the hand ,
and suddenly i &apos;m sitting in the engineering department ,
building doodads with wolowitz .
all right .
have you considered improving your socialization skills ,
thus allowing you
to communicate more effectively with other people ?
isn &apos;t that their burden ?
i &apos;m the one with something interesting to say .
fair enough , but in its essence ,
teaching is a performance art .
in the classroom paradigm ,
the teacher has the responsibility to communicate ,
as well as entertain and engage .
i sense that you &apos;re trying to slow @-@ walk me to an epiphany .
would you mind very much jumping to it ?
perhaps you should consider taking acting lessons .
acting lessons .
interesting .
it might help if i could act as though i care
about my students and whether or not they learn .
penny .
penny . penny .
what ?
you &apos;re an &quot; actress , &quot; correct ?
i &apos;m not an &quot; actress . &quot;
i &apos;m an actress .
all right .
you &apos;re an actress .
i need you to teach me .
you want an acting lesson ?
perhaps two . i &apos;d like to master the craft .
okay , where is this coming from ?
it has been suggested to me that acting techniques
could improve my lecturing , at which ,
if certain tweets and blogs are to be believed ,
i &quot; suck the big one . &quot;
yeah , i saw those . they were funny .
i printed a few out and put &apos; em on my fridge .
so , when could we start ?
okay , just to be clear .
you are asking me for help because i know something
that the brilliant dr. sheldon cooper doesn &apos;t .
i suppose that &apos;s one way to look at it .
i think it &apos;s the only way to look at it .
are you going to help me or not ?
probably . i &apos;m just enjoying the foreplay .
does this mean you are done mocking my acting career ?
oh , i &apos;m sorry , i thought making the transition
from actor to acting teacher
was the signal that one &apos;s career
had reached the end of the road .
forget it .
i &apos;ll pay you $ 40 .
saturday , 9 : 00 a.m. bring cash .
raj , i have amazing news !
what ?
i just got offered a fellowship
at the weitzmann institute in israel .
dude , that &apos;s incredible !
i know .
the only thing is , i &apos;m gonna be gone for two years .
aw , i &apos;m gonna miss you .
are you going with him ?
i have to stay here for school .
that &apos;s what we &apos;re here to talk to you about .
you see , bernadette has needs .
what kind of needs ?
sexual needs .
most of them regular ,
some of them kind of messed up .
so , while i &apos;m gone ,
you &apos;re going to have to satisfy her .
what do you say ?
i say okey @-@ dokey .
what ya thinking so hard about ?
just that i &apos;m definitely not gay .
penny !
penny ! penny !
what &apos;s wrong ?
nothing . i was acting .
you were acting .
yes . in preparation for today &apos;s studies ,
i read stanislavski &apos;s &lt; i &gt; an actor prepares , &lt; / i &gt;
stella adler &apos;s &lt; i &gt; the technique of acting , &lt; / i &gt;
uta hagen &apos;s &lt; i &gt; respect for acting , &lt; / i &gt;
and henry winkler &apos;s &lt; i &gt; ayyy , i &apos;m an actor . &lt; / i &gt;
well , good for you .
come on in .
how shall we begin ?
well , i thought we &apos;d start
with some basic movement exercises .
you know , get our bodies warmed up a little .
all right .
so i just want you to relax
and kind of move around in the space .
you know , just do whatever feels natural .
sheldon ?
you said to do whatever feels natural .
this feels natural .
certainly more natural
than what you &apos;re doing .
come on , you got to work with me .
we need to get connected with our bodies .
penny , my body and i have a relationship
that works best when we maintain a cool ,
wary distance from each other .
all right , let &apos;s just say we &apos;ve warmed up .
you &apos;re the &quot; teacher &quot; .
okay . one of the things that might help you
in connecting with your students
is being a little more spontaneous .
so why don &apos;t we try some improvisation ?
why not ? it seems like
you &apos;re improvising your entire curriculum .
this is all about listening and responding .
gotcha .
i &apos;m going to create a character
and a situation , and you just jump in when you feel it .
all right .
all right .
action .
okay , it &apos;s not a movie .
it &apos;s improv . so no one calls &quot; action &quot; .
hey , you taught me something .
who would have thought it ?
okay .
uh , no , the shipment has not arrived ,
and i really need those shoes .
they are my biggest seller .
yes , ladies sizes six through ten .
thank you . oh , sorry .
i have to go . i have a customer . bye @-@ bye .
hi . can i help you ?
i &apos;d like a frozen yogurt , please .
yogurt ?
okay , sure .
luckily , we sell both shoes and yogurt here .
you do ?
yes . look up at the sign ,
and remember , improv is always about saying yes .
all right .
yes .
i see a sign .
it says &quot; camarillo state mental hospital &quot; .
what ?
it &apos;s the only explanation i can come up with
for why you think you sell shoes and yogurt .
okay , you know what ?
let &apos;s just try a different improv . uh ..
oh , this time we will be two winos
living under a freeway overpass .
oh , and we &apos;re going to use props ?
you bet .
i had dreams , you know .
i was gonna be famous .
show everybody back home i could be someone .
now look at me .
want some ?
you have any frozen yogurt ?
i &apos;m still not adjusted
to how the syfy channel spells their name now .
s @-@ y @-@ f @-@ y . that &apos;s &quot; siffy &quot; .
hello ?
oh , my god ! is he okay ?
what happened ?
hang on . hang on .
okay , thank you .
howard was on his scooter , and got hit by a truck .
he &apos;s in critical condition .
oh , no !
did you hear ?
isn &apos;t it terrible ?
have you seen him ?
they wouldn &apos;t let me in .
oh , my howie .
it &apos;ll be okay . it &apos;ll be okay .
it &apos;ll be okay .
it &apos;ll be okay .
it &apos;s howard .
howard , hello .
raj , is that you ?
yeah , i &apos;m right here , buddy . how are you ?
shh , shh . listen to me .
i &apos;m not gonna make it .
no , no , no , don &apos;t say that .
you &apos;re going to be all right .
raj , i don &apos;t have time . now , pay attention .
my last wish is that you look after bernadette .
of course , of course .
now when you say &quot; look after , &quot; you mean ...
sexually .
excuse me , bernadette . i have to hear it from him .
sexually .
got it . take care .
i guess i have no choice
but to make sweet , guilt @-@ free love to you
over and over again for the rest of my life .
that &apos;s how i heard it .
or it could be &quot; sy @-@ fee . &quot;
what ?
s @-@ y @-@ f @-@ y . &quot; sy @-@ fee . &quot;
oh , right .
good one .
so , did you get a chance to go over the scene i gave you ?
yes . i didn &apos;t care for it .
okay , &lt; i &gt; cat on a hot tin roof &lt; / i &gt; is an american classic .
so is the mcrib sandwich .
i don &apos;t care for that , either .
fine . what would you rather do as a scene study ?
i &apos;m glad you asked .
i took the liberty
of adapting a &lt; i &gt; star trek &lt; / i &gt; fan fiction novella
i wrote when i was ten into a one @-@ act play .
and you think it &apos;s better than tennessee williams ?
why don &apos;t we leave that for future generations to decide ?
&lt; i &gt; where no sheldon &lt; / i &gt; &lt; i &gt; has gone before . &lt; / i &gt;
it &apos;s the story of a young boy who is transported
from the ignorant backwoods of east texas
to the 23rd century ,
where his genius is not only appreciated , but celebrated .
kmn ...
now , in this pivotal scene ,
sheldon &apos;s mother , played by you , argues with an emissary
of the united federation of planets , mr. spock ,
the role i will bring to life .
okay , that &apos;s fine , but let &apos;s try
and get you out of your comfort zone .
why would we want to do that ?
it &apos;s called &quot; the comfort zone &quot; for a reason .
okay , the whole point of this is to loosen you up a little ,
so i &apos;m thinking you &apos;ll play the role of your mother ,
and i will bring life to mr. spock .
i &apos;m sorry .
you &apos;ll be spock ?
it &apos;s only logical .
very well .
i &apos;ll set the scene .
all right .
&quot; east texas .
&quot; a warm summer night .
&quot; a woman , mary ,
&quot; stands on a porch .
in the distance , we hear a lonesome train whistle ... &quot;
&quot; the droning buzz of cicadas .. &quot; &quot;
&quot; a coyote howls at the moon ,
frightening sensitive young boys everywhere . &quot;
&quot; out in the woods ,
an owl screeches ... &quot;
okay , okay .
we get it . you set the scene .
hoo !
now just read your mother &apos;s line .
&quot; shelly !
&quot; shelly , how many times have i told you
&quot; not to leave your sciencey stuff out on the porch ?
&quot; goodness ,
&quot; i &apos;ll never understand that boy .
&quot; but then again , i &apos;m a religious nut ,
and my mind is closed to so many things . &quot;
&quot; spock to &lt; i &gt; enterprise . &lt; / i &gt; transport successful . &quot;
&quot; glory be to heaven ,
&quot; some sort of creature just manifested out of thin air .
&quot; george , put down that pepsi can full of bourbon
that ain &apos;t foolin &apos; no one , and get your shotgun ! &quot;
&quot; greetings , mary cooper .
i am spock . &quot;
i &apos;m sorry . i just don &apos;t buy it .
just keep going !
&quot; oh , my , your sudden appearance startles me . &quot;
&quot; we have been monitoring your son sheldon
&quot; from the 23rd century , and
&quot; we have determined that he is now ready
&quot; to join us .
&quot; his unique genius is our best hope
for bringing peace to a vast and troubled galaxy . &quot;
&quot; i understand .
&quot; oh , shelly ?
&quot; a man &apos;s here to take you away to the future !
be sure to pack clean underwear . &quot;
okay , okay , let &apos;s try that last line again ,
and this time , maybe try choking up a little .
why ?
well , you &apos;re losing your son .
yes , but he &apos;s going to a better place
where he won &apos;t get beat up ... so much .
all right , come on , just try it my way .
pretend you &apos;re sad to see him go .
i &apos;m gonna lead you in .
&quot; his unique genius is our best hope
for bringing peace to a vast and troubled galaxy . &quot;
that &apos;s your cue .
i &apos;m sorry . i just love that line .
even the way you do it .
all right , come on , come on .
put some real emotion into it .
blah @-@ blah , blah , blah ...
&quot; vast and troubled galaxy . &quot; go .
&quot; oh , shelly ?
a man &apos;s here to take you away to the future &quot; &quot;
&quot; be sure to pack clean underwear . &quot;
that &apos;s good . that &apos;s good . that &apos;s good .
mommy , why are you crying ?
&apos;cause i &apos;m gonna miss you , shelly @-@ bean ,
even though you creep the bugeeses out of me .
okay , i guess we &apos;re improvising now .
i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s not my fault .
i &apos;m just incredibly smart ,
and everyone around here is dumber than a bag of rocks .
oh , now , don &apos;t you start crying .
you get in that spaceship .
mommy &apos;s late for indian bingo .
mrs. cooper , hey , it &apos;s penny .
yeah , i think i broke your son .
hey , hold on .
talk to your mother .
mommy , i love you .
don &apos;t let spock take me to the future !
hey , raj ,
i know you &apos;ve been avoiding me and howard ,
and i &apos;m not leaving until you tell me what &apos;s going on
inside that little head of yours .
