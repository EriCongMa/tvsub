What's your name?
A.J.
This is a guy that me and my brother made up.
We put the symbol in the windows of our bedrooms.
Like a bat signal?
Brandon Foster, piano.
You're here as a composer.
You're a composer too, huh? I'm Tony.
Brandon, you'll be working with Kat.
There's no way you're pairing me with him.
Sometimes I just want to die.
Maybe we could do some other stuff tonight.
I don't want to do it. I mean, I want to do it,
But not like this. It's our first time, and...
We gotta get on the road.
Want a beer?
A.J.?
What's wrong?
I let someone sleep here.
Damn it, Callie. Why?
You're fired.
Are you almost done in there?
You do know that we're in the worst drought
since 800 A.D., right?
Oh my gosh, I forgot my conditioner.
Can you go get it from our bathroom, honey?
Okay, well, can you not waste water while you wait?
Hey, I'm late, and I need to shower too.
Hello?
Why don't you take a spit bath in the kitchen sink?
Wait, what's a spit bath?
I don't know. Sounds disgusting,
but I'm next.
Excuse me.
You got wood rot.
Wood rot? That doesn't sound good.
It isn't.
You'll have to open up the wall. And while you're at it,
I recommend you upgrade to copper plumbing.
Okay, honey, I need...
Honey.
What?
The guy is here.
Yeah. Hey, how is it going? I need my conditioner.
Okay, I will bring it to you.
I'll get it.
Thank you. It's the blue one in the...
Okay, I will bring it to you.
Would you quit pushing me?
Dear, honey, please.
So that's your...?
Yes.
So, Sophia's coming over today.
How's she doing?
Good, I think.
We're just gonna hang out.
But Robert invited us
to spend Father's Day on his boat.
No, thanks.
You're totally welcome.
Welcome to what?
If you're gonna spend Father's Day with him, don't you think
It's weird to keep calling him Robert?
'morning.
'morning, love.
I don't have to go.
I don't care if you go,
but he's not my dad.
You don't have to always invite me. It's okay.
Well, listen, Jude, we're having Mike over on sunday...
kind of a family tradition for Father's Day,
You know, to celebrate
the important men in our lives.
I guess we won't have to make cheese blintzes this year, will we?
Cheese blintzes?
Yeah, they were my father's favorites.
My first Father's Day without a father.
It's certainly not gonna be a party
without Frank around to offend somebody.
I'm sure you'll manage that.
That's funny.
Can I invite my dad?
Donald?
Yeah.
Why?
You're spending the day with your dad.
It's a little different.
How is it different?
Well, for starters, Robert actually wants to be in my life.
Donald just signed the papers and walked away.
Robert signed the papers, too.
Is he better because he's rich?
Donald doesn't want anything to do with you.
You don't know what he wants.
It's pretty obvious.
Why do you hate him so much?
'cause he killed our mother.
Callie.
It was an accident.
Drunk driving is not an accident.
Okay, that's enough.
If Jude wants to invite Donald...
then he's welcome to.
Fine.
But don't be surprised when he doesn't show up.
It's perfect.
Thank you.
...Technically,
but your melody's anemic,
your rhythmic statements are mundane,
and your intervals are reductive.
The whole piece is utterly jejune.
Considering the amount of time that I had,
I did the best I could.
Those are the five most pathetic words in the English language.
People who are satisfied
with the best they can do will never be great.
Six, actually.
I'm sorry, what?
Six words.
I never said I was satisfied.
I just...
Then start over.
Fine.
Okay, I'll meet you here at 8:00 tomorrow morning.
Wait, tomorrow?
I gotta sleep at some point.
You have your whole life to sleep.
We have one shot at Disney hall.
Get inspired.
And take a shower.
We got one working bathroom at home,
Six people.
I'm just saying.
How is it going with Kat?
Oh, you know, she's...
A bitch?
Hey, man, we're all bitches.
And this bitch would give his left nut
to compose for Kat.
Well, if it was up to me, you could have her.
'cause I'm pretty sure nothing I do
is gonna be good enough for her.
It won't be.
But if you can take the heat,
she's your golden ticket, man.
How do you stay so calm and cool?
I'm a cool dude.
How's your fugue?
It's pretty tight.
Can I hear it?
Yeah, sure.
It's so cute.
I ordered it online last week.
Why don't you give it to Isabella yourself?
Um, I think Ana needs some space.
Well, I'll see that she gets it.
But...
I hope you're still coming for Father's Day.
It would mean the world to Victor.
And your uncles and cousins will be here,
And everybody is so excited to meet you.
Look.
Is Ana coming?
Of course.
She says her brothers are upset that she's back
and living with you.
They're wary about their sister.
She put us all through a lot.
It's gonna take time to trust her.
But we're family.
And don't worry,
We're gonna keep the party small and intimate.
Please say you'll come.
Do your moms know you got fired?
I haven't told them yet.
I want to try to find
some other independent study first, you know,
so they don't totally freak out.
So where's this A.J. guy now?
I don't know.
Living on the streets probably.
Was he cute?
That's not why I tried to help him.
Okay, but he was hot, right?
Stop it.
I'm just saying.
How's everything with you?
Fine.
You sure?
Yes.
And I wish that everyone would stop asking me that question
every five seconds.
Sorry.
Hello.
Hey, it's me... AJ.
I'll just be right back.
Okay.
Are you in juvie?
I got arrested.
For huffing.
Tagging.
Gang signs. But I didn't...
I really don't care.
Callie, please, I need your help.
I tried to help you and you screwed me over.
I'm not in a gang.
Good for you. I gotta go.
Wait.
There's a skate park on Oceanside.
Go check it out. You'll see.
Please.
Callie. Please?
Do me a favor, lose my number.
Callie.
I spoke with Donald,
and he would like to come tomorrow.
Okay.
Is it?
Oh, I won't be here, so I won't have to see him.
You want to talk about it?
No, thank you.
Sophia's outside.
Look, I'm really sorry about before.
I... I'm on these new meds,
and they make me sort of irritable,
as my mother would say.
It's fine.
You want to get out of here?
Yeah.
Where do you want to go?
Nice one.
What are we looking for?
I'm not exactly sure.
There.
What is it?
It's a bat signal.
We're having a party.
No kidding.
Come on, take a break.
Come have a beer.
No, I... I can't.
Just one beer.
No, I... I... I really can't.
How's it going?
It's not.
Yeah, that's right. You know why?
'Cause you're all in your head.
Come on, man, you gotta chillax.
Look, even if I wanted to chillax,
I would still have to drive home and then get up
at the crack of ass to get back here by 8:00.
You don't have to get up at the crack of ass,
'cause your ass can crash in my crib...
On one condition.
One beer, and then I gotta get back to work.
Cheers.
Cheers.
What?
Kat.
Brandon.
Get over here.
Go.
Hey. I was just having one beer.
Well, that's no fun.
Come on, let's do tequila shots.
Hey, A.J. I'm Stef.
What's this?
This is my foster mom.
You asked me for help.
Go ahead, have a seat.
I won't bite.
Callie tells me that you're looking for your brother,
you think he might be missing. Does he have a name?
Is he in trouble?
Well, you tell me.
I mean, because I ran away to meet up with him?
Yeah, but you didn't meet up with him,
did you?
No, he never showed.
Okay, what was the plan if he had showed?
We were gonna go to Arizona.
He said knew some guy that could get him a job there
in construction.
We just wanted to be together.
You were arrested for tagging, yes?
Yeah, but cops just assume that 'cause I'm black I'm in a gang.
Yeah, well, I don't assume that.
But, you know, it is illegal to deface property,
even if you are just leaving a message for someone.
Look, I was gonna turn myself in.
But I knew that once I got back in the system,
I'd be harder to find.
I just wanted Ty to know where I was.
Ty?
Tyrone Hensdale.
That's my brother.
Is there any chance that
he might have gone to Arizona by himself?
No, there's no chance.
If he didn't show, it's 'cause something happened to him.
Okay, fair enough.
I'll see what I can do.
Are you gonna be okay in here?
I'll be fine.
Thank you.
That was fun.
You are fun.
Well, you are fun.
What, does that surprise you?
A little, yeah.
Listen, we got off on the wrong foot.
Do you know what the soul of genius is?
Love. That's what Mozart said.
Love.
Right.
I need to love you.
Okay.
I also need to pee.
Go for it.
Hey, you.
We are going to Disney Hall.
All right.
And I'm sleeping in tomorrow.
Great.
You're fun.
You're really fun.
These kids are so luck.
I even hear a single few
that's worthy of being played at Disney Hall.
Okay, see? This is exactly what I'm talking about.
I'm willing to get up on a sunday morning to work with him,
and he's 30 minutes late.
What happened, Brandon?
I overslept. I'm sorry.
Did you rewrite your fugue?
No, I didn't get a chance to finish it.
Why? What were you doing all night?
He's obviously not taking the program seriously.
Tony said he's willing to compose for two pianists.
Okay, you know what? I did write a fugue.
She didn't like it.
It was so...
Jejune.
Yeah, I know. Whatever the hell that means.
And now he's defensive.
I deserve a partner as talented and dedicated as I am.
Okay, Kat. I hear you.
Let me think about it.
In the meantime, Brandon, let's hear what you've got.
"Good for a
batch of fresh cookies."
Yeah.
Sounds delicious.
"Good for a day at the movies."
Always.
"Good for one car wash." I like that. I like that.
Yeah.
Oh, I like this one.
"Good for one 20 minute foot rub."
Can I redeem this right now?
Oh, yeah.
I'm sure Callie wants to watch me rub your feet.
I love all these. These are great,
Except for this one.
I get to teach you to drive?
Well, yeah. Callie's getting her license.
I haven't done the test yet, so fingers crossed.
I'm sure you'll pass with flying colors.
And you have a birthday coming up too.
Yes, we're gonna have a party at the house,
so I'd love for you all to come.
Of course. We'd love to. We'll be there.
Sophia, you need to eat something.
And I will.
So, dad,
I have something for you.
It's no big deal.
Uh, yes, it is.
Yeah, it's a huge deal.
You took this?
You don't have to hang it up or anything.
Are you kidding me? Of course I'm gonna hang it up.
It's beautiful. Look.
Oh my gosh, Callie, it's amazing.
Wow, you're very talented.
Okay, put it away now, please.
Mom.
Sophia.
I can't take my meds on an empty stomach.
And god forbid I don't
take them every day at exactly the same time.
I'm just following your doctor's orders, Sophia.
Well, you'll be happy when
you don't have me to worry about anymore.
What does that mean?
When I get better, of course.
He doesn't have a record, you know.
He's never been in trouble before.
I spoke to his foster parents,
and they said that he's a good student,
always followed the rules until he ran away.
And they won't take him back?
Not everybody gives second chances.
Or thirds, or fourths.
Ha-ha. I don't know,
there's just something about him. He's a good kid.
And I think the longer he stays in detention,
the more at risk he is of getting into some real trouble.
You're thinking about fostering him?
No, no, no, no, no. We can't.
But I was thinking about you fostering him.
Me?
Yeah, why not you?
Mariana.
Are you leaving already?
I actually haven't gone in yet.
Where's Isabella?
She's with my mother.
Have you gone in?
No.
Not yet.
Are you going to?
I don't think so.
Why not?
Because I'm embarrassed.
Of what?
Of being your daughter.
How are you?
Good. Come in.
Thanks.
Happy father's day.
Oh, thanks.
These are for your moms.
They love flowers.
That's good.
You... you're, like, a foot taller, huh?
Yeah, my moms say I'm gonna
have to start cutting my pants into shorts.
Yeah, I had that problem when I was a kid too.
How tall are you?
Six feet.
You're gonna be taller. My dad...
Your granddad... was six-three.
So is Callie here?
No, she's with her dad...
I mean, Robert.
Yeah.
A friend of mine's coming over, with his dad.
Okay.
But don't worry, they don't know that you were,
you know, in prison.
So you don't have to...
Yeah. No, it's...
It's okay, Jude.
So Jude doesn't want his dad to know...
about him and me.
I got no problem with that.
The fewer people that know, the better.
Look at all those fake smiles.
They think I don't know.
Know what?
That they're sending me back to the hospital
or to one of those
therapy boarding schools where they lock you up.
How do you know?
It's my mom.
She is afraid to leave me alone,
afraid I'll try to hurt myself.
She just wants to get rid of me.
What have they said to you?
Nothing. They're probably just afraid
that I'll run away or...
I don't know.
Are you sure you're not just...
What? Being paranoid?
Because I'm crazy?
You're not crazy.
They're always whispering, okay?
And when I walk into the room, they shut right up.
There was a girl that I met in the hospital.
Her parents sent her to one of those schools in Montana,
and she said it was like a prison.
Can you please talk to my mom?
Talk to me about what?
I didn't mean to hurt your feelings.
Oh, it's okay. I understand.
I'm embarrassed too.
I caused my family a lot of heartache.
Want to know a secret?
I've been walking around the block for an hour,
trying to get the courage up
to show my face in there.
I'm not even sure my brothers will speak to me.
But, Mariana,
I'm the only one who needs to feel ashamed.
I'm the one who did all the bad things, not you.
You and Jesus are pure and innocent,
and no one in there is judging you.
I'm not innocent.
Of course you are. You did nothing wrong.
Yes, I did.
Mariana.
I had sex for the first time,
and not with Mat.
So, anybody following the playoffs?
Miami's my team, but since LeBron left,
it's been a miserable season.
Yeah. How about you, Donald? Who do you like in the finals?
Truth is, I'm not much of a sports fan.
Me neither.
So, Donald, what you do for a living?
I'm a mechanic.
Oh, nice. You been doing that a long time?
No, I was in commercial real estate before that.
So am I. We probably know some of the same people.
I doubt it.
It was a while ago. It was...
It was up in the bay area.
So why did you get out?
The grind, you know.
I'm just happier fixing cars.
I hear you. Tough business, huh?
It's not as tough as being a cop though. Right, Mike?
I don't know any different.
You know, Stef's a cop too.
Oh, yeah, yeah. No, of course.
Well, I think pretty much any profession
has its challenges, right?
So where in the bay area, Don?
I know a couple of guys up there.
Sorry, I'm really late.
You look like hell.
Thanks. Happy father's day.
Okay, well, who did you have sex with?
Wyatt.
And Wyatt is?
Callie's ex-boyfriend.
I'm a terrible person, and I feel like a slut.
Don't you ever say that about yourself.
I cheated on my boyfriend,
and I lost my virginity to a random boy I barely know.
I'm pretty sure that makes me a slut.
What if I get pregnant at 15,
just like you did?
Did you use protection?
A condom.
But what if it had, like, a hole in it or something?
I heard that happens.
It's pretty unlikely.
I just kind of want to forget that it ever happened.
Well, why do you think it did happen?
Because Mat didn't want to have sex with me,
so he could hook up with girls on tour.
Or he didn't want to just have sex with you,
your first time, and then leave.
What teenage boy turns down sex?
The good ones. The ones who care about you.
The ones who don't want you to feel
the way you're feeling right now.
Do you think I should tell Callie?
I don't know.
But...
you should probably tell your moms.
I'll tell you one way I think we're probably a lot alike.
We probably judge ourselves
way harsher than anyone judges us.
So what do you say,
we go to this party together.
And trust
that we can be forgiven for making mistakes?
Okay.
When?
Well, as soon as...
We just wanted to have
a nice father's day and...
We were gonna tell you tomorrow.
And where will I live?
At home, with me.
We have no intention of sending you anywhere.
And I'm so sorry, sweetie,
you thought that's what was going on.
And this is...
it's just a separation, okay?
We're not talking about a divorce here.
Your father rented a house at the beach.
You can see him anytime you want.
Why can't I live with him?
Sophia, your mother
is not responsible for this.
We just need some time apart.
Why?
I mean, if you're not getting divorced,
then why do you need time apart?
Look, sometimes
when you're not with someone,
it helps you remember all the reasons you want to be.
They're still your mom and dad,
and they still love you,
and I love you.
It's gonna be okay.
I baked some cookies, if anyone has room left.
Not me. I ate like a horse.
Yeah, everything was fantastic.
Thank you.
It was really delicious. Thank you.
How about a toast? To our amazing hostesses.
Cheers.
A toast to the amazing men in our lives.
Salud.
Brandon, would you like to be excused?
You look like you could use a nap.
No, I'm good.
Yeah, you look real tired.
Come on, I'll tuck you in.
Aww, daddy.
All right.
Please, don't get up. I'm just gonna clear the dishes.
Let me help you with that.
Thanks, love.
Thank you.
Thanks, Donald.
So, Donald, are you still in the same place?
Oh, no, actually I had to move.
I should probably give you my new address.
Yeah, that'd be nice. Nice to know where you are.
Do you think Callie is gonna be home soon?
I'd kind of love to see her.
I'm sure she'd love to see you too,
but she's probably gonna be late.
Thanks, Adam.
No problem. You're welcome.
Listen, I've been doing some reading
about, you know,
kids Connor's age coming out.
And, well,
some L.G.B.T. experts say
that it's better for kids to wait till they get a little older
to go public, you know,
so they can better cope with bullying and stuff
in school and sports teams and all that.
Well, that ship has sailed, at least at anchor beach.
But I can promise you
we have a very strict no-bullying policy.
What do you mean, that ship has sailed?
So the whole school knows you're gay?
Was it you? You the one who told everybody?
No.
No, we... I got outed.
By whom?
I don't know.
I'm sorry. I thought your father knew.
What does that matter, Adam?
'Cause I happen to care what people think, okay?
About you or your son?
Well, it seems like it's his business who knows.
What, you want your son getting bullied too?
No.
I want my son to be proud of who he is.
Getting bullied at home is worse than anything
he's gonna face out in the world.
That's not my intention.
I know, dad.
Feeling better?
Yeah, a little.
Have a few drinks last night?
No.
No?
I think I know a hangover when I see one, Brandon.
Dad, I...
Look, I get it. There's peer pressure,
kids like to have parties.
Brandon, there's a reason
it's illegal to drink before you're 21.
Teenagers make bad decisions.
They're not mature enough to drink responsibly.
I didn't even want to drink.
I just...
Believe me, I regretted it.
Well, at least you made one good decision.
You didn't try to drive home last night.
Look, how is Idyllwild otherwise?
It's intense.
I don't know. The people are so competitive.
I thought I made a friend,
but he ended up stabbing me in the back.
You gotta rise above all that, you know.
Do your work, stay focused,
don't get involved in the petty stuff.
Yeah.
Hey, can I ask you something?
How would you feel about me fostering a kid?
B?
Hey, dad.
Yeah?
I love you.
Love you.
Thanks for coming.
Thanks for the invitation.
It meant a lot, Jude.
You know,
it's not good for any of us to keep secrets about who we are.
And you have everything to be proud of,
except me.
If you don't want to tell people where I've been
and what I've done, that's okay.
You don't have to.
But you don't have to protect me either.
You know, my story... it's part of your story.
You want to tell it... you got every right.
I just...
just want to let you know I'm okay with that.
Can we stay in touch?
Yeah, you bet.
Hey, there's Callie.
Donald, this is Robert.
It's nice to meet you, Don.
You too.
I have to get a bus.
Don't want to miss it.
In case you forgot,
Donald was there for you when he wasn't.
And he's just as much your dad as he is mine.
Thanks for today.
Yeah, hold on.
Sit down. I want to talk to you.
Okay, look, I understand
that you're angry with Donald.
But Jude's right. He was there when I wasn't.
Because he pretended he was my father,
and he never told you about me.
I'm sure he was just respecting your mother's wishes,
and he didn't just pretend to be your father, he raised you.
He killed my mother. It's his fault that she's dead.
He made a mistake.
All right, it was a terrible, horrible mistake.
He never should have gotten behind the wheel,
but your mother never
should have gotten in that car with him either.
So now it's her fault?
No, it's not.
But we've all made mistakes.
The only difference is how much suffering they cause.
Donald... He might be out of prison,
but he will never be free of that guilt
and that remorse.
Can you imagine that?
He still could have fought for us.
Look, I had...
I was unfaithful to Jill.
That's why we're separating.
I was selfish,
I broke my promise, and I hurt her very much.
I think I've been telling myself all this time
that it was your mother
that was the love of my life.
And I think sometimes I treated Jill
like something I settled for.
But the way she stood by me
when you came into our lives,
with her love and support,
it made me realize that she is...
everything.
She's the love of my life,
along with Sophia, and now you.
And I was very foolish not to see that.
My point is,
I am not a better man than Donald.
I'm just luckier.
So, you a cop too?
Actually, I am.
Callie's foster mom and I are partners,
and... we used to be married.
Sounds complicated.
No, it's good, you know?
Stef and her wife are gonna adopt Callie, so...
What?
Like, Callie has two moms?
Yep.
Like you said, it's complicated.
I don't know. Having two moms sounds kind of cool.
So where's yours?
She's in a institution.
She's mentally ill.
And your dad?
He's dead.
I got a grandma.
Yeah?
Yeah.
She raised me and my brother, after.
Is she...
She's alive.
She's in a home. She's got dementia.
She couldn't take care of us anymore,
so they put us in foster care.
Well, look, I ran your brother's name through the system,
and he hasn't been arrested.
That's good, right?
If he's not in jail...
can you see if he's dead?
'Cause he's all I got.
Dad!
I just wanted to say
happy Father's Day.
I made you miss your bus.
It's okay. There'll be another one.
So we have three birth uncles
and eight birth cousins.
And everyone was super nice.
They're all really close, and super sweet to Ana too.
Well, it sounds like everyone had a really good Father's Day.
And speaking of...
Right.
Oh my gosh.
Oh, what?
Well, even though it's Father's Day...
We wanted you to know...
That we are grateful for all our mothers
and fathers, but mostly...
We're grateful for our parents.
Oh my gosh.
Sounds like a card.
That's very sweet. Did you rehearse that?
Mariana made us.
And they loved it.
They're from Jesus too.
Oh, guys.
I got it.
Hello. Hey.
What's up?
You did? Okay.
I don't know. A couple of weeks.
I will ask her.
Ask me what?
Hey, Callie.
Would you mind coming in here for a second, please?
Have a seat.
What's going on?
Um, I went to juvie to talk with A.J.,
and I've...
We've decided I'm gonna foster him.
Yeah, it's gonna take some time
for Mike to get his license,
so, in the meantime, A.J. is gonna stay here with us.
Okay?
