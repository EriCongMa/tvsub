i think that you should take me home .
you know , i can &apos;t drive right now .
the police have many theories .
what was that about ?
shana .
she clearly doesn &apos;t believe my story .
she &apos;s trying to trip me up .
did they not make the offer ?
what offer ?
assistant coach .
the team took a vote .
zack hit on me .
were you trashed ?
no .
if you want to spiral out of control
and self destruct , go right ahead .
but i am not going to let you take my mom down , too .
oh , my god !
push it up against the gate .
i asked noel to break into hanna &apos;s house .
why would you do that ?
i needed someone like hanna &apos;s mom
to stop questioning what happened to me .
why would noel help you with this ?
what was the plan if he &apos;d got caught ?
&quot; i &apos;m sorry , mrs. marin ,
i just needed to borrow a butcher knife ? &quot;
you &apos;re a little loud .
you &apos;re a little crazy .
spencer , your eye is getting worse .
yeah , i see plenty out of the other one .
hey , what &apos;s going on ? how &apos;s your mom ?
freaked .
guys , we needed to do this .
you saw tanner cornering me at school .
she &apos;s trying to poke holes in our story .
your story .
oh , was that noel ?
is that who you &apos;ve been sneaking out of your house
in the middle of the night to meet ?
what &apos;s that supposed to mean ?
you &apos;ve been spying on me ?
well , maybe now you &apos;ll understand
why i turned to noel .
at least someone still has my back .
ali .
what ?
i see what &apos;s going on here .
one of my best friends doesn &apos;t even show up
to my s.o.s. call and the other one is ...
shadowing me like i &apos;m the enemy .
maybe asking noel to do this wasn &apos;t the perfect plan ,
but i &apos;m kind of running out of choices .
where are you going ?
i &apos;m gonna call my dad back .
i &apos;d like to do it outside ,
but , spencer , are you gonna follow me
or have you already set up a camera for that ?
you know , she never even answered that question about noel .
the only thing i can &apos;t figure out
is how did he get time to break into this place
and lock us into those stables .
spencer , it wasn &apos;t noel &apos;s helmet in those stables .
i mean , we should be wondering if melissa--
my sister wasn &apos;t the one who hired noel kahn
to terrorize hanna &apos;s mother .
i don &apos;t know , for all we know she could have asked noel
to choke her that night in her living room .
she &apos;s clearly gone rogue .
i walked in on that , spencer .
okay ? it wasn &apos;t noel .
you &apos;re sure ?
hanna . easy .
you know what ?
last time i checked this was still my bedroom ,
till somebody else got in and invaded it .
even the doorknob smells like her .
why were you smelling the doorknob ?
it &apos;s my mom . i &apos;ve got to go .
take me with you .
hanna , you can &apos;t stay at my house .
seriously , you guys , i have to get out of here .
make sure she doesn &apos;t drink and dial .
i can &apos;t keep doing this .
you have to meet me half @-@ way .
it &apos;s too dangerous
and i &apos;m not taking anymore chances , okay ?
it &apos;s too dangerous
and i &apos;m not taking anymore chances , okay ?
shana , please , don &apos;t fight me on this .
第五季 第九集
morning .
how &apos;d you sleep ?
who says i &apos;m up ?
is alison in the shower ?
i guess .
so ...
i was thinking you girls should meet me at the mall
after school today .
who &apos;s &quot; you girls &quot; ?
you and alison .
i thought it might be nice to treat ourselves
to something new for ella and zack &apos;s party .
i &apos;m not going to that party .
what are you talking about ? why not ?
because i have a make @-@ up test on monday .
hanna , i think aria will be pretty hurt if you don &apos;t go .
she &apos;ll be fine .
can &apos;t you study for it over the weekend ?
mom ,
i told you she &apos;s not gonna care if i go or not , okay ?
hanna ?
this is not the answer .
this is dangerous
and disturbing
and you know it &apos;s totally unacceptable .
mom , i know .
okay ? you don &apos;t have to do all of this .
okay , listen to me .
i get it now . all right ?
i know what you and alison
and your friends have been going through .
i was here in my own house
and i was terrified .
i know you &apos;re looking for an escape .
and honestly , i don &apos;t blame you .
but you can &apos;t afford to not be in control ,
especially not now , when alison &apos;s kidnapper is still out there .
but they &apos;ll catch him .
i promise you .
han , where &apos;s your moisturizer ?
just use mine , alison .
so when did you first meet mr. fitz ?
um , first day of class , junior year .
your principal stated that , to his knowledge ,
you engaged in an intimate relationship with mr. fitz
after he was no longer a teacher at the school .
i &apos;m sorry , what does any of this have to do
with the incident at the marin house last night ?
we have several open cases right now .
and it &apos;s helpful to explore possible connections .
what &apos;s the possible connection here ?
i can &apos;t say .
you can &apos;t say or you don &apos;t know ?
mrs. montgomery , if you would prefer
to conclude this interview , that is your right to do so .
i will ask a judge if he--
no , no , that &apos;s okay .
let &apos;s just get it over with .
were you aware of mr. fitz seeing other students socially ?
students like shana fring ?
what are you saying ?
is it possible that mr. fitz had intimate relations
with other students ?
how would she know that ?
no .
do you ever recall seeing mr. fitz interacting with shana--
he didn &apos;t serial date students .
he wasn &apos;t some creep
that was prowling the school hallways hitting on girls .
aria , they &apos;re just questions .
刚看到诺埃尔 他肯定在这里
are you next ?
what ?
tanner &apos;s here again .
she &apos;s hoping for a mutiny , spencer .
if that frizz @-@ top @-@ cop just gets one of us to cave--
i &apos;m not caving .
okay , but what about aria ?
she &apos;s totally icing us out .
is there something going on between her and hanna ?
i don &apos;t know .
well , neither does hanna .
or at least that &apos;s what she says .
how long are you gonna be staying there ?
where &apos;s your dad ?
i played down what happened last night
so he wouldn &apos;t rush back .
what ? it &apos;s not like i feel safe in my bedroom .
i need to go to class .
i &apos;ve to leave early to see the eye doctor .
spencer .
if one of us falls , we all fall .
and &quot; a &quot; wins .
did you guys come to school together ?
no .
caleb dropped her off .
she &apos;s the one you should be following .
all of our student coaches must maintain a high level
of academic standing .
are you taking a language this semester ?
yes .
i &apos;m in ap spanish .
ah , yes , right there . there it is .
you are apparently doing very well .
felici ...
taciones .
exactly .
you still working at the brew ?
yes , but i can scale back my hours ,
i mean , especially when it comes to meets .
how &apos;s the shoulder injury ?
i &apos;m much better .
well , clearly your fellow sharks want you back ,
男生储物柜分配
in the pool or out .
but the final decision rests with me .
are you free for practice on tuesday ?
yes .
then i guess you have a new job .
felici--
i can &apos;t . i took german .
congratulations .
thanks .
tuesday . don &apos;t be late .
yeah .
aria , can you slow down for a second please ?
i &apos;m late for class .
i think mrs. welch will understand .
hey , aria .
hey , mrs. montgomery .
hi , noel .
aria , you cannot lose your cool
when you &apos;re asked those questions .
those weren &apos;t questions , mom .
ezra &apos;s on her hit list and she &apos;s wrong .
it &apos;s her job to find out as much as possible .
oh , please , not you , too .
aria , i know this is hard ,
but sometimes we do have blind spots
when it comes to the people that we love .
okay , i really need to get to class .
i &apos;m already skipping fifth period
to help you set up for the party .
you &apos;re right .
thank you .
bye .
bye .
has toby been up here recently ?
no , why ?
how about the board of health ?
i was gonna straighten up after i took a shower .
you can sit down ...
somewhere .
no , i can &apos;t .
i just was stopping by on my way to the ophthalmologist .
is there something growing in that pan ?
hanna tried to make nachos .
caleb , this can &apos;t go on .
it &apos;s a frying pan .
i &apos;ll just-- i &apos;ll buy toby &apos;s stepmom a new one .
i &apos;m talking about hanna .
she &apos;s a mess .
and she &apos;s been that way ever since you got back .
i think you have me confused with alison .
no . i know the difference .
she &apos;s getting wasted in the middle of the day .
she &apos;s not wasted .
she &apos;s crashing into people that she cares about .
okay . i understand her not wanting to toast zack tonight , but--
zack ?
what does she have against zack ?
i meant , aria , aria &apos;s family .
you don &apos;t have to draw me a map .
come on , caleb , you &apos;re not dense .
you know what we &apos;re up against .
&quot; a &quot; is back and the cops are circling us
with a million questions .
hanna cannot be stumbling around the halls of school
looking like she &apos;s on a bender in cancun .
hey , what &apos;s wrong with cancun ?
don &apos;t knock it until you &apos;ve been there .
she &apos;s making some scary mistakes .
she &apos;s a big girl .
yeah . she &apos;s also a loose cannon .
and you &apos;re supplying her with gunpowder .
what ?
she &apos;s not drinking alone , caleb .
look , i don &apos;t know what happened to you
when you were away .
that &apos;s right .
you don &apos;t know the first thing about it .
okay .
and it &apos;s none of my business
and maybe i &apos;m not one to judge ,
but the thing is that i &apos;ve always thought
that you were the best thing that ever happened to hanna .
and it really hurts to watch you guys fight
whatever is eating at you like this .
but you guys used to draw strength from each other
and now it &apos;s ...
i don &apos;t get this .
i got to take a shower .
so what &apos;s next for you ?
bio .
lucky .
they make me take earth science
with a bunch of ninth graders .
it &apos;s really humiliating .
uh , wait .
i &apos;ll walk you .
i don &apos;t need an escort .
han , i &apos;m sorry about what happened last night .
okay ? i &apos;ll pay for the window .
it &apos;s not about the window .
your stupid stunts affect a lot of people .
are we talking about your mom ?
or are you and aria fighting about me ?
i can help you . i can talk to her--
i don &apos;t want you doing anything at all .
i just want to be left alone .
and i think it &apos;s best if you just stay with one of the other girls .
han ...
what &apos;s happening to us ?
our group is falling apart .
hey , jenna .
it &apos;s alison .
i didn &apos;t know that you had enrolled here in rosewood .
i came back a few weeks ago .
nobody seemed to notice .
but then again ,
i didn &apos;t come back from the dead .
i &apos;m sorry about shana .
she meant a lot to me , too .
thanks .
and i &apos;m sorry for you .
i heard about the break @-@ in last night .
it must be hard to come back here
knowing someone &apos;s still after you .
wait .
how did you do it ?
what ?
shana .
she was my friend before she met you .
how did you turn her against me ?
i didn &apos;t .
you did .
别急着回来 坦纳有很多事想问你 都是关于莎娜的
you can sit out here and relax while your pupils dilate .
the doctor will be out here in about 10 minutes .
okay . thank you .
emily ?
can i call you right back ?
no !
i &apos;m in noel &apos;s car .
emily , jenna &apos;s here , okay , with another jenna .
what ?
they gave me these eye drops , okay .
and i thought that i was hallucinating but i &apos;m not .
stop . listen to me .
i got his keys out of his locker
and searched his car .
he has pictures of alison from when she was dead .
that makes no sense .
oh , but seeing two jennas does ?
define &quot; dead . &quot;
the last two years of her life .
he put them in the same envelope
as the tape he was listening to .
why would he even have that stuff ?
i don &apos;t know ,
but i need to drop off his car keys
at the lost and found before he--
fine , but then i need you to come right here .
i can &apos;t .
emily , my eyes are not playing tricks with me , okay ?
something freaky is happening .
em ?
hello ?
emily ?
sorry , i thought i just saw noel coming out the door .
false alarm .
spencer , you there ?
spencer ?
so you think somebody help jenna mess with her chronic ?
hey , em , i &apos;ve got to go .
but we can talk about this at the party .
well , not at the party , but soon .
hey .
hey there .
were you able to get more candles ?
i did , but they only had scented ones .
how do we feel about smelling patchouli
while eating steak ?
yeah , i think we lose the candles .
this crowd looks better in the dark anyway .
shoot . i got to go .
i &apos;m gonna miss my hair appointment .
oh . well , we &apos;ve got this covered .
okay . perfect .
thank you .
mm @-@ hmm .
bye .
bye .
bye .
bye .
can i squeeze these in there ?
yeah , sure .
okay .
what are you doing ?
i am updating the list .
hanna can &apos;t make it .
oh , no ? why not ?
uh , she said that she wasn &apos;t feeling well .
what &apos;s wrong with her ?
i don &apos;t know . that &apos;s all she told me .
oh , there you are finally .
which room was it in ? the chart ?
shh . they &apos;re in there .
who &apos;s in there ?
jenna .
and jenna .
do you want to see what i found in noel &apos;s car ?
no , i can &apos;t even see my feet right now .
there .
sydney ?
oh , hi , emily .
spencer .
what are you doing here ?
she was my ride .
is that a problem ?
yeah , kind of .
unless you &apos;re driving a taxi .
when did you two become friends ?
we should go--
sydney , emily asked you a question .
it sounded more like an accusation .
how come you never mentioned that you and jenna were friends ?
maybe it never came up .
maybe you should let her speak for herself .
excuse me ?
when you ask the organ grinder a question ,
you don &apos;t really want to hear from the monkey .
can we please leave ?
wait--
for more insults ?
how long is it gonna take for you to both
realize that you &apos;re nervous around the wrong person ?
i &apos;m not alison .
come on , syd .
&quot; hey , caleb . hey hanna &quot;
&quot; how was your day ? &quot;
&quot; my day was fine . how was yours ? &quot;
my day sucked , actually .
what happened ?
could we just watch this ?
i &apos;m not in the greatest mood .
does that mood have to do with this party
that we &apos;re not going to tonight ?
i wouldn &apos;t go to that party if you paid me .
and that &apos;s because ?
because i &apos;m just not feeling it .
i have never seen you turn down
free food and a chance to dress up .
last year for cinco de mayo
we drove 10 miles out of town to a gas station
just for the free burrito and a mini sombrero .
why are you acting so weird about this ?
what &apos;s weird is going to a party
and listening to toasts about eternal love
when one in three marriages end in divorce .
and what are you placing your bets on this one ?
hanna , does this have anything to do
with the guy that ella &apos;s marrying ?
he &apos;s just gross .
okay , can you please be a little bit more specific ?
he &apos;s a sleaze .
he gave me his number and he wants to meet up ,
although no one seems to believe me .
i believe you , okay .
why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
it &apos;s not a big deal .
yes , it is . this dude--
it &apos;s embarrassing .
right , for him .
then why am i the one who feels like crawling into a hole
and never coming out of it ?
let &apos;s just not talk about this anymore .
you know what ?
um , there &apos;s just not a lot to eat here .
so i &apos;m gonna stop in maggiano &apos;s
and get you your favorite .
you just-- you stay here
and you watch the chickiest chick flick that you can find .
all right ? i &apos;ll be back soon .
hey . i need your approval .
you look amazing .
really ? the necklace isn &apos;t too much ?
no , it &apos;s perfect .
okay , thanks .
now i can relax .
when it comes to fashion , you are my guru .
mom ...
are you sure that you want to do this ?
i mean , maybe you should just wait .
wait for what ?
aria , if you don &apos;t want me to get married ...
no , it has nothing to do with you getting married .
it has-- it has to do with you marrying zack .
how well do you really know him ?
why are you saying that ?
was he inappropriate with you ?
no , not with me .
maybe he was with hanna .
mom ?
why did you go there right away ?
um , there was an incident before we came here .
but i guess i just explained it away
to myself as pre @-@ wedding jitters .
i &apos;m so sorry , mom .
yeah .
me , too .
hey , guys , make sure to keep the chafing dishes
on the side opposite the seafood .
okay ?
are you with the catering crew ?
no . i just walked in .
oh , sorry , man .
we &apos;re closed tonight for a private event .
i &apos;m not here for a latte .
i need to talk to you .
uh , i &apos;m actually kind of busy right now .
yeah , it sounds like you &apos;ve been busy .
being the kind of scumbag
who &apos;s begging to get his ass kicked .
excuse me ?
do you hit on all of aria &apos;s friends
or is it just hanna ?
so i &apos;m guessing you &apos;re the boyfriend .
i respect you coming here .
seriously , i do .
but , honestly , this is just a misunderstanding .
that so ?
she clearly took what i said way too seriously .
i was just joking .
i don &apos;t know , man .
she has a pretty good sense of humor
and she didn &apos;t find you funny at all .
well , i think your girlfriend &apos;s just embarrassed .
i didn &apos;t want to have to do this , but , uh ...
i was only reacting to the signals i was getting .
this isn &apos;t hanna .
sorry to break the bad news ,
but your girlfriend slipped that into my pocket .
don &apos;t worry .
i &apos;m not coming back for the party .
uh , where &apos;s the food ?
caleb , where have you been ?
he &apos;s a piece of crap , but he has a strong jaw .
caleb , you didn &apos;t .
of course , i did .
oh , my god .
hanna , there &apos;s a problem .
yeah , no kidding .
how is that going to explain that he got a fat lip ?
i didn &apos;t write this .
i know .
do you think that &quot; a &quot; decided to get in the mix ?
saw that zack was a dirtbag
and decided to move things along ?
this is why he got into my car .
yep .
couldn &apos;t you find somewhere to hide it ?
and have noel kahn breaking into my bedroom ?
no , thanks .
it &apos;s gonna take you forever to get to the lake house and back .
you can &apos;t miss this party .
i &apos;ll be there . just save me a shrimp .
no , seriously .
i mean , aria &apos;s already on a war path with hanna .
if it looks like we &apos;re taking sides ...
this is bigger than that .
these pictures decimate alison &apos;s story
and once that falls apart , we are next .
these have to be in a safe place .
fine . just hurry .
got a minute ?
why are you parked on my street ?
i wanted to explain .
is jenna hiding in the trunk ?
please . let me explain .
why would i ever trust anything you said again ?
i met jenna a couple years ago .
i used to volunteer at the school for the visually @-@ impaired .
yeah , in philadelphia .
i was there the day that alison came to visit jenna
and i pretty much glued jenna back together when alison left .
that was a long time ago .
she &apos;s been through a lot since then .
so has jenna .
and when she heard alison was alive
and coming home , she panicked .
she felt totally alone , so she reached out to me . and--
what exactly did she ask you to do ?
i mean , besides taking her to her doctor &apos;s appointments ?
she just wanted to feel safe , i guess .
make sure that alison--
okay , forget alison .
you latched on to me , sydney , giving me gifts ,
taking over my weekends with training ,
telling me sob @-@ stories about how you had no one
cheering for you in the bleachers .
i didn &apos;t expect to like you .
what ?
i-- i didn &apos;t know you &apos;d be such a decent person .
i guess i was expecting you to be ...
this is so messed up .
oh , it &apos;s about to get messier .
i &apos;m taking that coaching position
just so i can be in your face ,
watching you as much as i can .
emily .
i want to see you underwater long enough for you
to feel that twinge of panic
when you need air and you can &apos;t get it .
i want you to know
what it feels like to be sucker @-@ punched .
surprise .
what the hell are you doing here ?
give me the key .
get out of here now .
i swear , noel , get the hell out or i &apos;ll--
you &apos;ll what ?
call the cops ?
sure you want them to see what you &apos;re hiding in here ?
get out of here !
now !
you break into my car ,
steal something from me and i &apos;m the bad guy ?
nice .
give me the key .
why do you even have that stuff ?
and we know that it was you that broke into hanna &apos;s house .
we know that you &apos;re helping alison .
you know nothing .
give me that key !
what are you two gonna do next ?
what are you gonna do with that stuff ?
talk to me !
alison doesn &apos;t even know i have it .
and if you tell her i do--
wait , are you guys working together or not ?
our friend likes to throw away people
when she &apos;s done using them
and i need to be prepared , okay ?
they aren &apos;t just pictures , spencer .
it &apos;s proof that she was never kidnapped .
you &apos;re going to blackmail her .
it &apos;s not blackmail .
it &apos;s insurance , in case she turns on me .
and i need it back .
where did you even get it , those pictures , the tape ?
shana sent them to jenna .
and alison asked me to borrow them from jenna &apos;s bedroom .
so you broke into that house , too ?
when ?
minutes before it blew up .
alison keeps telling me i &apos;m lucky
i got out when i did , but ...
part of me is starting to wonder
if that explosion wasn &apos;t a coincidence .
what does she have on you , noel ?
why would you do this for her ?
enough questions .
just give me the key , spencer .
no .
give it to me !
no !
you stupid bitch !
you try that again and i swear to god ,
i will slit your face open .
that stuff is mine .
you &apos;re not the only one who needs insurance , noel .
we need it , too . okay ?
and i promise you ,
i will keep it in a much safer place than this .
okay ?
now go .
go !
i heard that i could find you here .
can i come in ?
it &apos;s-- it &apos;s nice .
could use a housekeeper .
aren &apos;t you supposed to be giving a toast right now ?
what happened ?
nothing that hasn &apos;t happened before .
apparently , he &apos;s a big jerk internationally .
look , i &apos;m not trying to defend the guy ,
but just so you know , &quot; a &quot; stoked the fire .
it doesn &apos;t matter , hanna .
he took the bait .
why didn &apos;t you believe me ?
it wasn &apos;t-- it wasn &apos;t so much that i didn &apos;t believe you .
i guess i just wanted to believe something else more .
that my mom could actually find someone again ...
be happy .
i get that .
will you forgive me ?
so what do you think really happened ?
i don &apos;t know .
i mean , don &apos;t you think it &apos;s weird
that aria &apos;s mom would just get food poisoning
right as everyone is showing up ?
weddings are tricky .
they churn up a lot of stuff .
especially the second time around .
there may be more to the story .
totally .
someone &apos;s not telling the truth .
you like kale ?
i &apos;ll eat anything as long as it &apos;s not from the brew .
oh , that &apos;s probably hanna .
hello ?
yes , lieutenant tanner , she &apos;s here with me .
why ?
well , no , i ...
her father doesn &apos;t get back until early tomorrow .
what &apos;s going on ?
but i can bring her .
no , i understand .
we &apos;ll be right down .
thank you .
what &apos;s going on , mrs. marin ?
what &apos;s wrong ?
the police , they caught him .
caught who ?
the person who broke in here last night .
they &apos;re questioning him
and they think he &apos;s ready to talk .
they want you to go down to the precinct
and answer some questions .
you won &apos;t have to do this alone .
i &apos;ll be with you .
sorry , i thought everyone would be at the party by now .
do you need me to ...
no , no , come in . it &apos;s your house .
you were nice enough to let us use it while you were gone .
how was the conference ?
it was fine .
why aren &apos;t you at the party ?
it was canceled .
&apos;cause , you know , it seems kind of silly
to have an engagement party
when you &apos;re no longer engaged .
do you want to talk about it ?
not really .
but aria can fill you in on everything ,
hopefully , after i &apos;ve checked into a motel .
i don &apos;t know why i took all this out
because i &apos;m never going to get it back in .
you &apos;ll do it .
you were always really good at that ...
figuring out how to make a small space work .
you know , sometimes i still think about
our first place together .
remember that dump on east 6th ?
what was the ad ?
what did they call it ?
it wasn &apos;t a studio .
it was something smaller .
a &quot; bachelor . &quot;
yes .
of course .
as if that explained why the bathtub was in the kitchen .
well , i guess they assumed that bachelors don &apos;t bathe ,
which is why they &apos;re still bachelors .
i felt so bad that i couldn &apos;t get us something better .
you were already pregnant with aria
and yet , you figured out a way to make it seem big .
the skinny lamp that fit in the sliver of space
between the window and the radiator .
hiding the fact that you could get yourself a soda
while washing your hair .
it was all about a well @-@ placed drape .
ella , i don &apos;t really know this guy ,
but whoever doesn &apos;t realize
that you make this small world seem so much bigger ,
that person doesn &apos;t deserve you .
is this your first attempt to see her
after she ran away from you ?
she didn &apos;t run away .
she jumped out of my car .
and you had her blindfolded .
that &apos;s right .
at least when i was around her .
are you referring to the car ride ?
no .
since the day she came away with me .
after i hit her .
where did you hit her ?
back of the head .
i followed her into the yard
and i found a rock and i hit her .
then i carried her to my car .
where did you take her ?
philly .
a place i was staying near south street .
your home ?
i was crashing there , yeah .
it was a basement .
nobody else was there .
and you kept her locked up
in the basement all that time ?
can you turn the volume down ?
alison , is that him ?
is that the man who kidnapped you ?
the doctor &apos;s running just a little behind .
it shouldn &apos;t be much longer .
you think you can entertain yourself ?
if you &apos;re cold , i can turn down the ac .
he followed me into my yard .
and then he hit me with that rock .
next thing i knew i woke up blindfolded .
