yes ,
mrs. sergeant donovan .
penny !
no . oh , god .
i killed her .
you can &apos;t blame yourself , matt .
i don &apos;t . i blame you .
if you want to talk about stefan , that &apos;s okay , all right ?
i didn &apos;t have anything to say to him then ,
and i don &apos;t have anything to say about him now .
but there hasn &apos;t been any closure .
i don &apos;t need closure .
no , i do .
i need to know if the effects of those pills can be reversed .
the effects of my blood can &apos;t be reversed .
that would mean you just gave the girl you love a death sentence .
you &apos;re on your last mortal life .
we &apos;d like to take that life and transfer it to bonnie .
let another take up her burden .
wait , what ?
when she wakes , she &apos;ll be just like me .
full of hatred for you and your kind .
bonnie ?
bonnie ?
nice and slow .
nice and slow .
how you feeling ?
i don &apos;t know .
just feel different .
considering you were on death &apos;s door ,
that &apos;s probably a good thing .
okay , here &apos;s how i &apos;m feeling .
i &apos;m thirsty and starving .
i &apos;m on it .
i &apos;ll get you a glass of water .
okay .
i actually think i want a bourbon .
neat .
there &apos;s the girl i love .
right .
what should we drink to then ?
new beginnings .
my god .
oh , my god . enzo , no !
what &apos;s happening ?
nothing &apos;s happening , mate .
that &apos;s the problem .
bonnie won &apos;t wake up .
rayna screwed us .
she failed to mention that by giving bonnie her life ,
she was actually giving bonnie her lifestyle .
so now when bonnie wakes up , she &apos;s gonna be rayna 2.0 .
and does that gift begin with a very long nap ?
i didn &apos;t get a chance to ask as she burst into flames .
and before you ask , no , i did not get a chance to interrogate
her little shaman friend ,
because he vanished at the same time .
damon , did the spell work or not ? !
i don &apos;t know , enzo .
i have no idea why she &apos;s not waking up .
i mean , the least she could do to thank us for saving her life
is just open her eyes ,
let us know whether or not she wants to murder us .
what if she doesn &apos;t ?
what ?
oh , you know her as well as i do .
waking up means she &apos;ll have to kill us .
so what if the reason bonnie isn &apos;t waking up
is because she &apos;s bonnie ?
i think she &apos;s better off in here , don &apos;t you think ?
it &apos;s quieter and more peaceful .
did you grab those scented candles ?
not exactly .
no .
no , you &apos;re not going to do this .
you heard what damon said .
if she wakes up ...
when she wakes up ,
we do not know what she &apos;s going to be
or how she &apos;s going to feel .
and if we chain her up , we &apos;ve made that decision for her .
okay , fine . no chains .
but then i &apos;m not leaving .
ric .
the flight &apos;s in an hour .
it &apos;s the last flight out tonight ,
and lizzie and josie have been stuck
with a sitter for two days now .
i know , but if this goes the wrong way ,
i &apos;m the one person bonnie &apos;s not gonna want to kill on sight , okay ?
i should be here with you .
while our three @-@ year @-@ old children are in a different time zone ?
okay , then you get on the plane .
let me stay here and help .
that &apos;s the safest , most logical plan anyway .
i am the single best person for bonnie to see when she wakes up .
and you are the single best person
for our girls to see when they wake up .
take the flight .
i &apos;ll be home as soon as i can .
i promise .
i &apos;m gonna hold you to that promise .
we &apos;ll get through this .
sir ?
i know you said you didn &apos;t want to be disturbed .
is there a break in penny &apos;s case ?
yeah , it turns out it was an accident .
you need something , deputy ?
yeah , you wanted to be notified
if there was any activity over at the salvatore house .
seem to be some squatters tonight .
do you want me to go over there and ... ?
no , i &apos;ll take care of it .
what do you want , damon ?
do you never check your voicemail ?
i left you about nine messages .
yeah , sorry . i &apos;ve been a little busy telling matt donovan
he &apos;s the reason his fiance &apos;s dead .
do i want to know how that went ?
probably not .
you also probably don &apos;t want to know
how screwed you are with bonnie either .
i &apos;m sorry , i must have the wrong number .
because i dialed h for &quot; hero . &quot;
clock &apos;s ticking , brother .
you need to get your head in the game .
my head is in the game , damon .
my life was blown apart when i was marked by rayna &apos;s sword ,
you remember that ?
i had to leave everything i loved behind and run for years .
so as much as i want bonnie to wake up ,
i &apos;m not exactly looking forward to doing that again .
all right , all right , i get it .
you don &apos;t have any ideas .
i don &apos;t either .
this conversation just got really depressing .
well , i never said i didn &apos;t have an idea .
rayna used to say that she had to kill me ,
but she didn &apos;t want to .
she could sense my humanity
through some sort of psychic link .
so if bonnie &apos;s fighting the same war in her head ,
we need to give her some ammunition .
what , so one of us needs to delve into her subconscious ,
and ... do what exactly ?
convince her hunter @-@ brain that not all vampires
are selfish vicious monsters .
it &apos;s exactly why i &apos;m the worst person for the job .
she &apos;s my girl .
i &apos;ll do it .
no , it should be me .
i was her best friend before i was a vampire .
i can show her the difference between the two .
she &apos;s right .
i &apos;m not really in the mood for a backseat head @-@ driver right now .
i just wanted to see if you needed anything .
you want to be helpful ?
then do your thing and run away so i can focus on my friend .
okay , i can take a hint .
if you thought that was a hint , you were not paying attention .
now for our favorite subject .
anyone ?
anyone ?
vampires .
real or myth ?
bonnie ?
myth .
wrong .
vampires are as common today as mosquitoes .
they can walk in the daylight ,
kill from the shadows .
hell ,
some of your best friends might be vampires .
so what do we do when we meet a vampire ?
anyone ?
invite them to the party .
very funny .
anyone else ?
how about you , bonnie ?
what would you do , huh ?
would you sit there , or would you run ?
or would you fight back ?
show me how to kill a vampire , bonnie .
this isn &apos;t real !
this is what you &apos;ve been going through ?
get away from me .
you &apos;re not real .
well , you &apos;re half right .
i &apos;m in your head .
your body is safe in damon &apos;s bedroom .
this isn &apos;t real .
and you just need to stay focused on me , bonnie ,
your friend .
caroline .
something &apos;s messing with my head .
all my memories are being twisted into these freakish nightmares .
it &apos;s your brain rewiring itself to hate vampires ,
to become the hunter .
you have to resist .
i &apos;m trying .
i don &apos;t want to hurt you .
you just have to concentrate on who i am ,
you know , not what i am .
i have kids now , bonnie , and a family .
you should see the girls . they are just getting so big .
you have to fight the voices in your head .
open your eyes and just come and have dinner with us .
we miss you so much .
do your kids know ... that you &apos;re a vampire ?
uh , no , we haven &apos;t had that talk with them yet .
kind of waiting for the birds and the bees first .
and when you tuck them in at night ,
and you brush the hair off their pretty necks ,
admire it a little ?
bonnie , that &apos;s gross .
this is your lizard brain talking .
fight it .
i can &apos;t help it .
all i see is you losing control .
hurting those little girls .
no , that &apos;s not me .
you know that &apos;s not me .
and you have the nerve to call them your kids .
what happened ? how &apos;d it go ?
about as bad as it could have .
oh , no .
she stabbed me .
in the dream ?
yeah . how is that possible ?
i don &apos;t know . you may have been marked .
tell me this isn &apos;t real .
it &apos;s real .
and if bonnie wakes up ,
you &apos;re the first person she kills .
i just need some air .
well , you can slow down and talk to me .
why ? you don &apos;t understand how she marked me any more than i do .
caroline , when you were in bonnie &apos;s head ,
she must have created some sort of psychic link .
the scar is just a manifestation of that connection .
you need to get as far away from her as you can . starting now .
no , that is not an option .
enzo &apos;s gonna figure it out .
he &apos;s gonna get through to her .
caroline , i carried that scar with me for three years .
i &apos;ve lived through this before .
so all of a sudden
the past three years have just been a living hell for you ?
i saw the postmarks on your letters , stefan .
paris , marrakech , bora bora .
i &apos;m shocked you even had time to write
between escaping certain death and sipping mai tais .
meanwhile , i was so desperate ,
i called klaus for help .
who &apos;s nowhere to be found , by the way .
caroline , just ...
no , i do not want an explanation .
all i want is for you to respect my choice to not run away .
something wrong , deputy ?
it &apos;s sheriff now .
you got a lot of balls coming back to mystic falls .
bonnie is comatose on damon &apos;s bed .
have your pathetic rules ever meant less ?
those rules are the last shred
of what my fiance and i built together .
well , no disrespect to your dead girl ,
but my still @-@ alive girl is hanging on by a thread ,
and i &apos;m about to use my vampire powers
to try to find a loophole in her subconscious ,
knowing full well that if i fail ,
i &apos;ll be forever marked for death at her hands .
she wouldn &apos;t be in this situation
if it weren &apos;t for you and damon .
it &apos;s an endless cycle . penny knew that .
she knew that we needed to take a stand .
yeah ? how &apos;d that work out for her ?
if you want to follow in her footsteps , be my guest .
barge in there , guns blazing ,
the great ...
cowboy sheriff of mystic falls ,
or you could table your feelings about vampires
until your friend is awake .
your choice .
all right , bonnie , i really need this to work .
look , i admit , i was a bit skeptical
when i found out you and enzo were a thing , okay ?
well , real skeptical .
but if he can &apos;t get through to you ,
and i &apos;m your last lifeline ,
we &apos;re screwed .
hey , short skirt , you want to join us ?
uh , i don &apos;t think so .
what about now ?
i @-@ i &apos;m sorry .
let me go .
like i said ,
i don &apos;t think so .
guess it &apos;s true what they say .
public school system in the states really has gone to rot .
enzo .
so you &apos;re in control of what i &apos;m seeing now ?
uh , so long as you don &apos;t fight
my mucking around in your subconscious .
meaning we could have gone anywhere ?
&quot; anywhere &quot; means paris , by the way .
so why are we walking around in my old high school ?
i might ask you the same question .
i guess i &apos;m trying to find something to hold onto .
a time before vampires were a part of my life .
take those stoners .
chad carpenter used to annoy me after practice every day ,
but he was a jerk .
not a vampire .
it &apos;s like the spell is overriding who i was .
who i am .
maybe you &apos;ve just been looking in the wrong place , luv .
still not paris .
no , this is my fantasy now , remember ?
yeah , i &apos;m still wearing my cheerleading uniform .
how could i forget ?
you &apos;re trying to remember your life without vampires .
remember us instead .
when we wrote music together ...
... you not only tolerated a vampire ,
you fell in love with one .
play that song
and you will have something to hold onto .
like i do .
i have always wanted to be loved by someone
in the way that you loved me .
and i would rather have those memories
than any future where i destroy them .
well , you don &apos;t have a choice .
if you don &apos;t take rayna &apos;s life ...
then i &apos;ll die .
no . no , that is not an option .
do you hear me ?
i love you .
but this , this is my choice .
and i &apos;ve already made it .
now get out of here and let me go .
i &apos;m sorry , bonnie ,
but the one thing i can &apos;t do is leave you .
the hell happened ?
perfect .
well , i hope you got some quality time with her ,
because when she wakes up ,
your relationship is officially on the rocks .
that &apos;s the least of my concerns .
she &apos;s fighting it , all right .
just not the way we want her to .
if waking up means killing us ,
she &apos;d rather just slip away .
oh , good . you &apos;re up .
did you seriously just vervain me ?
yep .
is this a hostage situation ?
be mad all you want , just do it while you &apos;re looking at these .
&quot; hong kong . &quot; yeah , that &apos;s really funny .
all that matters is that we get moving , and we stay moving now .
&quot; we &quot; ? there &apos;s no such thing as &quot; we , &quot; stefan .
there hasn &apos;t been for a very long time .
fine . you want to do this alone , that &apos;s your choice .
oh , how ironic ,
considering that the only reason i &apos;m even here
is that you decided to go all caveman
and kidnapped me against my will .
this is not you .
you usually respect people &apos;s choices .
yeah , until it comes to life and death ,
and then it &apos;s not up for discussion .
there &apos;s always a choice .
you gave elena that choice .
and then i lost her .
elena asked me to rescue her friend
from the bottom of a river instead of her , and she died
because i respected her damn choice .
well , maybe one day you &apos;ll wake up and realize
that i deserve the same respect that she did .
but i stopped waiting for that day a long time ago .
whatever i decide to do about bonnie
is a decision that i &apos;m going to make by myself
or with my family , but not you .
caroline , listen to me .
when you bring your family into this ,
you &apos;re putting them in danger too .
and if i leave them behind , then i &apos;m abandoning them ,
which is just as bad .
maybe even worse .
where &apos;d you run off to ?
got caroline out of town .
huh , guess that &apos;s progress .
honestly , i &apos;m surprised she went anywhere with you .
well , jamming her with a syringe full of vervain
might have had something to do with it .
good call .
rinse and repeat as needed .
if you &apos;re agreeing with me ,
then i know i really screwed up .
hey , doing the wrong thing for the right reason
has always worked for me .
i hate that you get away with it .
well , that &apos;s why we &apos;re a good team .
i screw up , you wear the cape .
yeah .
hero never gets the girl , right ?
you of all people should know that .
well , take it from the guy who supposedly got it all
and is currently sitting with bubkes .
stop moping about who you are not
and try being who you are ,
the guy that &apos;s in love with caroline forbes .
you just vervained her , stefan .
in my playbook , that &apos;s a notch above flowers and chocolates ,
because when you love someone ,
sometimes you have to go to those extremes .
listen , i know that you &apos;ve been locked up in a coffin
for the last three years of actual civilization ,
but that is legitimately terrible advice .
actually , brother ,
that advice is so good that i have to take it myself .
all right , bon .
i couldn &apos;t reach your good side ,
i can sure as hell reach your bad side .
no more stefaning this situation .
i got to be me .
elena ?
you &apos;re not the imaginary pizza guy .
damon .
you sound disappointed .
hoping for someone else ?
leave me alone .
you &apos;re literally the last person i want to see .
oh , come on ,
we both know why you &apos;re really here .
we also know that you can &apos;t ever see elena again .
neither can i.
that &apos;s just , not until ...
i die .
which brings us to the reason i &apos;m here .
i just wanted to say thank you ,
before it was too late .
thank me for what ?
for fighting the good fight .
going gently into that good night ,
and a whole slew of other sappy clichés .
bottom line ...
you &apos;re gonna die , bon .
as much as i hate to admit it ,
it &apos;s gonna make me a very happy man ,
which is why i figured the least i could do
was dive into your brain and say good @-@ bye .
why ?
you usually don &apos;t bother .
hurtful ...
and untrue .
i present exhibit a for the defense ,
so if you &apos;d finally just read the damn thing ,
we could both go on our own way .
you to peace .
me to my girl .
what do you say ?
not good enough .
never has been .
never will be .
lucky for you , i memorized it .
dear bonnie , have a nice life ,
if your guilty conscience allows you to .
if there &apos;s one thing i would change about our friendship ...
i never would have pulled you off of that street in amsterdam .
screw you , damon .
you screwed me , all right .
got your life all intertwined with elena &apos;s , dooming me ,
and let &apos;s be honest , all of our friends ,
to a lifetime without the one person
we miss the most , which , to be perfectly clear , ain &apos;t you .
that &apos;s why we &apos;re on this porch ,
because it &apos;s the first place elena and i ever kissed .
over there by that bench ?
the first time she ever had the courage
to tell me she loved me ,
and merely one foot to my right ,
is where i watched her take the cure
so that she could have the life that she dreamed of
before you screwed it up ,
but the very spot you &apos;re standing ,
is the happiest place of all .
you know why ?
because that &apos;s the spot where you &apos;re gonna decide
to give me my elena back .
so , why don &apos;t you close those pretty little eyes
and give up the ghost for me ?
you &apos;re a monster .
sure am , but i usually get my way .
sorry , bon @-@ bon .
i had to get you to wake up somehow .
catch me if you can .
you &apos;re still here .
you &apos;re right .
it &apos;s not safe .
i &apos;m not safe
because of this stupid scar ,
and any chance that my girls might get caught up in this whole hunt .
i know .
believe me , i &apos;ve been there .
you think ?
i am in the exact same situation that you were in three years ago ,
and now that i finally understand how you felt ,
i &apos;m even more furious with you ,
because i know what a huge decision you had to make ,
and you made it without me .
look .
when i went to go find you in dallas ,
here &apos;s what i saw--
i saw you and ric and the kids , and you were happy .
you know what i didn &apos;t see ?
me .
so , i convinced myself that i was doing right by you ,
even though i had no idea what i was doing .
i &apos;m sorry .
and you have every right
to hate me for what i did to you three years ago .
and three hours ago .
just don &apos;t pretend that you wouldn &apos;t act any differently .
you &apos;re doing the same thing with bonnie right now .
you can &apos;t accept a world where bonnie dies .
even though that &apos;s a choice that she &apos;s trying to make for herself ,
and you know why ?
because you love her too much ,
and there &apos;s nothing wrong with that ,
and i love you ,
and the thought of you getting hurt ...
it &apos;s not an option that i &apos;m willing to entertain .
you hurt me .
more than anyone else has ever hurt me .
i loved you ...
and you left me .
i know .
all i can do is say that i &apos;m sorry and hope
that you &apos;ll forgive me one day .
i just don &apos;t think that i can do that .
bonnie ?
caroline , i can see you .
i can feel you .
you &apos;re marked and i know exactly where you are .
it &apos;s okay .
you &apos;re alive .
no , it &apos;s not okay .
i &apos;m not in control .
i &apos;m gonna come for you .
please , don &apos;t let it come to that .
okay .
we run .
how &apos;s it feel to be alive ?
i don &apos;t think there &apos;s a word to describe
the depths of hatred i feel towards you right now .
on the bright side , your skin &apos;s never looked better .
jokes .
dead man &apos;s last comfort .
come on , bon @-@ bon , you know everything i &apos;ve said
was just a ploy to make you wake up , right ?
really ?
is that why you &apos;re running through the woods scared ?
you can see me ?
not only can i see you ...
but i can sense what you &apos;re feeling ,
which is how i know deep down ,
there &apos;s a part of you that meant
what you said to me on elena &apos;s porch .
hey , i said what i said to save your life .
it &apos;s not the first time i &apos;ve saved your bacon , by the way .
don &apos;t actions speak louder than words ?
the only reason you saved me time and time again is because
you believe that if you didn &apos;t ,
elena would never forgive you .
a conundrum that you &apos;re now familiar with
because if you kill me , elena will never forgive you .
that &apos;s the thing , damon .
as you were so eager to remind me ...
i &apos;m never gonna have to explain myself to her .
out of my way , matt .
not until you hear what i have to say .
i couldn &apos;t get in your head ,
so i &apos;ve been waiting out here to do it the normal way .
you &apos;re too late .
i &apos;m not the person you used to know .
well , in case you haven &apos;t noticed ,
i &apos;m not the person you used to know , either .
that guy died two years ago with penny .
then come with me .
you helped rayna cruz before , so help me now .
i came here to talk you out of murdering our friends ,
not lend a hand ,
because i do know you , bonnie .
i &apos;ve known you since we were little kids ,
and i refuse to believe that the girl who bought me
my first football when we were nine
is gone for good .
then help me not do this .
keep me connected to my human side .
i don &apos;t know if fighting this will work ,
but i &apos;ll try if you will .
i &apos;m in .
now get in the truck , and we &apos;ll drive somewhere safe .
there is one condition .
what &apos;s that ?
i need to kill damon first .
damon salvatore .
the vampire who has ruined my life in more ways than i can count .
who has brought nothing but pain and suffering to our friends ,
and will continue to do it as long as he &apos;s alive .
the vampire who killed your sister
because he was bored .
like i said ...
i &apos;m in .
well , you caught me .
did you raid a cosplay convention or something ?
oh , they &apos;re real .
courtesy of matt , who is also setting up
a perimeter around the forest as we speak .
i &apos;m not so sure you want to do that .
you know , given matt &apos;s track record , i &apos;d say you &apos;ve got
about a 60 % chance of taking on some friendly fire .
nice toss , bonnie .
this hunter thing might be your best look yet .
truth is ,
i don &apos;t have to run from you .
why is that ?
&apos;cause you &apos;re not gonna kill me , bonnie .
you &apos;re right .
i &apos;m gonna dismember you .
i &apos;m gonna set you on fire ,
then i &apos;m gonna carve out your hateful heart .
you are a living , breathing reminder of everything that i &apos;ve lost .
when i look at you ,
i see a smug , selfish parasite
where my friend elena should be .
see the history that we have ?
that feeling ... i mean , it &apos;s almost ...
okay .
can you put daddy back on the phone , please ?
when are you coming home , mommy ?
uh , that &apos;s what i need to talk to daddy about .
i love you .
you know that , right ?
we love you , too .
all right , girls . it &apos;s time to go back to bed , okay ?
daddy &apos;s got to talk to mommy .
i &apos;ll tuck you in a little bit , all right ?
come home , caroline . we &apos;ll deal with this .
how ?
i don &apos;t know .
we just will .
we &apos;ll ... we &apos;ll run . together , as a family .
no . if anything ever happened to the girls , or you ...
i won &apos;t let it . i promise .
you know you can &apos;t promise that .
just stop being so supportive , will you ?
just yell at me and tell me this is all my fault , because it is .
if i had just left when i had the chance ...
where are you guys gonna go ?
wait . don &apos;t tell me .
it &apos;s safer that way .
i &apos;m so sorry , ric .
don &apos;t be .
you just keep moving .
and , caroline ...
you know i love you , right ?
i know .
i &apos;ll call you when ... i get a chance .
giving up already ?
on the contrary .
you &apos;re actually walking into my carefully laid trap .
oh , no .
a stump .
it &apos;s not just any stump , honey .
my grave .
from remembrance day .
a memorial to one of the many lives of bonnie bennett .
what &apos;s that supposed to prove ?
that you &apos;re a survivor .
that you will get through this .
i &apos;m not the one that needs to be worried about that .
i &apos;m gonna kill you .
no , you &apos;re not .
you know why i brought you to this stupid stump ?
because if i have to die ,
i wanted it to be here , bonnie .
in honor of you .
stop doing this .
i hate you .
i get it .
the bonnie that i knew yesterday is gone ,
and she may never come back .
but i &apos;m talking to you ,
crazy bitch bonnie in all her glory .
i still care about you .
stop .
look , bonnie .
look at the stump , bonnie .
you remember it ?
you died .
we mourned you .
and you came back .
you &apos;ve been so many things , bonnie .
a witch , a human , a ghost , a corpse .
an anchor to the afterlife ,
and now , the woman who &apos;s gonna kill me .
and every time , you come back stronger .
do you know how incredible that is , bonnie ?
do you know how much i envy you ?
hell , some days i can &apos;t even handle just being myself .
stop ... talking .
i can &apos;t .
because if this is my last moment with you , bonnie bennett ,
i need you to hear me .
i admire you .
i believe in you .
and i love you
the same way elena loved you .
if you kill me right now ,
it &apos;s not your fault .
i did this to us .
but please ...
... forgive me
before you do
what you have to do .
okay ?
i gotta hand it to you , sheriff .
you &apos;re a better shot than liz forbes ever was .
may she rest in peace .
those shots bought us eight hours
to get bonnie as far away from the rest of you as i can .
i don &apos;t want to waste a second of it talking to you .
that was my way of saying thanks .
now that you &apos;re in charge ,
maybe you and i should start getting along .
i &apos;ve actually got a pretty good track record
with the sheriffs in this town .
i did it for her , not for you .
even if you absolved her of killing you ,
she &apos;d never forgive herself .
i &apos;d never forgive myself .
look , man ,
what happened with penny ...
is my fault .
and i &apos;ll be paying for it the rest of my life ,
starting with taking responsibility for bonnie .
so if you want to thank me ,
figure out a way to fix her .
in 30 miles , take 95 north ,
and we should be in maine by tomorrow night .
and from there ?
i have no idea .
but i will figure it out when i have to .
you can &apos;t keep putting these decisions off .
fine .
uh , from maine , we will take the ferry to nova scotia .
happy ?
if not , feel free to swim .
i wasn &apos;t talking about that decision .
do you love him ?
i don &apos;t know .
can you love someone
and leave them behind right when you need each other the most ?
just ...
ask me whatever you want about directions and travel plans
and anything related to bonnie .
those decisions , i can make .
ric and me ...
... just please don &apos;t ask me to make that choice right now .
bonnie ! bonnie , i can help you !
mind if i join you ?
help yourself .
but this isn &apos;t a celebration .
bonnie &apos;s alive .
that &apos;s all that matters to me .
i couldn &apos;t get through to her .
i would &apos;ve been just another notch on her belt
if matt donovan hadn &apos;t stepped in .
well , as much as it pains me to say it ,
matt was man of the match tonight .
he found a lead on the shaman who helped rayna turn bonnie .
turns out that shaman was quite willing to talk ,
once he had a good look at his own entrails .
tell me you have a way to help her .
maybe .
maybe not .
bonnie &apos;s life is linked to that of the final everlasting .
sever the link ,
it might also sever the curse .
unfortunately for us ,
the everlasting resides in the armory .
yeah . in a coffin .
in a forever nap .
piece of cake .
uh , you &apos;re forgetting why bonnie the good witch
sealed the whole building shut .
the evil in the basement escaped from its vault ,
and now it could be anywhere in that bloody maze .
well , evil be damned .
we &apos;re gonna open the place back up .
please .
please .
make it stop .
