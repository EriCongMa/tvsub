since lot was afraid to stay in zoar ,
he and his two daughters settled in the hill country ,
ehere he lived in a cave .
the firstborn said to the younger ,
&apos;our father is getting old ,
&apos;and there is not a man in the land
&apos;to have intercourse with us as is the custom everywhere .
&apos;come .
&apos;let us ply our father with wine and then lie with him ,
that we may ensure posterity by our father.&apos;
so that night , they plied their father with wine .
and the firstborn went in and lay with her father .
the next day , the firstborn said to the younger ,
&apos;let us ply him with wine again tonight .
and then you go in and lie with him.&apos;
so that night , too , they plied their father with wine .
and then the younger one went in
and lay with her father .
and so it was that the two daughters of lot
became pregnant by their father .
and thus , lord , we maketh your word our command !
amen !
dearly beloved , we are gathered here
in the sight of god and in the face of this family
to join together this --

what do you feel like -- italian , thai ?
are we really gonna do this ?
do what ? i &apos;m hungry .
not talk about it .
i &apos;ll probably get turned down .
the trial -- nobody gets in this thing .
it &apos;s false hope .
did you hear what the doctor said ?
i mean , were you even listening ?
i mean , he said the prognosis is --
he said he couldn &apos;t predict .
no , he said that the trial was your best shot .
you don &apos;t want to do it , fine .
then do it for me . i can live with that .
just want to think about it .
there &apos;s nothing to think about .
i don &apos;t care if you get fat .
i don &apos;t care if you lose your hair .
you &apos;re applying for this trial .
you &apos;re gonna be accepted . do you understand me ?
i am not losing you .
soon as i get to the office ...
i &apos;ll make the call .
dmv ? really ?
i &apos;ve never even seen you drive .
that little fella ,
the one through the glass , his name is glen carter .
his mother calls him &quot; jelly bean . &quot;
a loathsome individual who , sad to say ,
possesses an uncanny ability to locate anything .
i presume you &apos;ve heard of justin kenyon ?
the smiling public face of the militia movement .
who hasn &apos;t ?
yes . the very voice of reason ,
the rebel darling of the fringe right --
charming , rustic , camera @-@ ready ,
the perfect spokesman to spin vile hatred and prejudice
into treacly dross that passes for plainspoken common sense .
forget it .
excuse me ?
justice knows exactly who justin kenyon is .
we know what he is .
the church of the shield is a cesspool
of polygamy , doomsday paranoia ,
ritualized elder and child abuse ,
but he also has four of the most prominent civil rights attorneys .
in the country on retainer -- we can &apos;t touch him .
how do you suppose he pays
for those high @-@ priced lawyers --
charitable contributions ?
his church has been audited
by the i.r.s. every year for the past decade .
his books are impeccable .
so are mine .
justin kenyon -- head of the church of the shield ,
a polygamist cult located on a 15,000 @-@ acre reserve
in the smoky mountains .
kenyon declared it a nation @-@ state ,
and petitioned to secede
in u.s. district court three decades ago .
according to reddington ,
kenyon has dozens of shipping containers
buried on his property .
terrorists , cartels ,
and criminals contract with him to store cargo ,
no questions asked .
reddington compiled a partial inventory
from his sources .
it includes all manner of contraband .
from drugs and hot merchandise to military ordnance ,
antiaircraft guns , missiles , r.p.g.s , semtex .
sounds like a one @-@ stop storage facility
for the criminal underworld .
in 1982,
kenyon published a book entitled &quot; the silver bear prophecies , &quot;
which he purported were delivered to him
by the spirit of an ancient druid elder .
in it , he claims to be the latter @-@ day incarnation
of an entity the silver bear called &quot; the ken &apos;yon . &quot;
how convenient .
ken &apos;yon and his followers will ascend into heaven for six days
and return to -- and i quote ...
&quot; rain fire upon the new babylon .
&quot; the defiled states of america ,
&quot; and our children shall cleanse her streets
with the blood of her founder &apos;s enemies . &quot;
according to reddington ,
ken &apos;yon has fallen off the radar .
his clients have been unable to reach him
or anyone on the compound since last saturday .
which means they don &apos;t have access to their stored goods .
as you can imagine ,
this makes a number of very dangerous people
very , very nervous .
not interested . can &apos;t be done .
glen , you have found things for me with far less to go on .
ernie &apos;s retirement party &apos;s tonight .
i got to pick up the shrimp platter .
you found jerry minkie &apos;s wife
after she ran off with the uber driver ,
the one with the subaru .
i don &apos;t even like shrimp .
you found , uh , the other guy -- who was that ? -- that ...
mobster who was hiding out in needles .
glen , look , you and i ...
we &apos;ve had our differences ,
but i have enormous respect for your abilities .
you know that .
if anyone can help me , it &apos;s you .
it &apos;s not the shrimp . it &apos;s the dip , that sauce .
i don &apos;t like sauces .
you know what ? forget it . i don &apos;t need this .
what are you so upset about ?
there isn &apos;t a retirement party , is there ? !
you &apos;re making it up !
that &apos;s what this is about !
this is what you want --
to see me get all lathered up !
you &apos;re pathological . you realize that , right ?
ernie &apos;s shrimp platter ? ! you can &apos;t be serious !
do you even see the irony in that ?
tell me about the safe .
glen , i &apos;m upset !
your spook friend -- he said it was critical .
as i &apos;ve already told you ,
he said there is a safe in st. petersburg .
on the second floor of i don &apos;t know where --
a bank , an apartment .
he died before he could tell me more .
the spook ...
what was his name ?
alan fitch .
alan ...
fitch !
fitch .
kenyon &apos;s been off the grid for three days .
according to his own words , that gives us 72 hours
before he delivers his version of armageddon .
his counsel has assured us nothing is amiss ,
and under no circumstances
are we to attempt direct contact .
they &apos;ve already won two civil judgments
on kenyon &apos;s behalf for harassment .
that was before we knew he was sitting on enough ordnance
to arm a third @-@ world country .
this could all go south fast and end up looking very badly .
i don &apos;t give a damn how it looks .
well , that &apos;s a luxury we cannot afford ,
not after waco and ruby ridge .
we &apos;re looking at a tactical nightmare --
78 square miles of virgin forest ,
a mountain stronghold with enough food and potable water
to withstand an armed siege for months .
and even if by some miracle
we manage to put down resistance
and seize that compound without loss of life ,
without harm coming to the 26 children who reside there ,
what if reddington is wrong ?
lizzy , exactly when have i been wrong ?
i told you -- there are political considerations .
if we raid kenyon &apos;s compound
and come up empty @-@ handed --
you will not come up empty @-@ handed .
but if we do ,
then we &apos;ll have validated kenyon &apos;s allegations
that the federal government are a pack of jackbooted thugs .
we &apos;ll have raised him up as a martyr for the constitution .
that &apos;s exactly what he wants .
lizzy , i have gone to considerable lengths
to point you and your team in the right direction ,
and now , due to political considerations ,
people will die .
and when they do
and the bureaucrats decide that the loss of innocent lives
trumps their career prospects ,
you be sure to give me a call .

unit b61 to dispatch ,
run a check on a late @-@ model chevy van ,
tennessee plate number delta @-@ oscar @-@ charlie @-@ 7 @-@ 7 @-@ 1 .
unit b261 , that tag number is 10 @-@ 40 stolen ,
registered to a 2005 jeep cherokee .
copy ?
copy that .
show us your hands !
hands outside the window now !
what the ...
hold your fire !
it &apos;s just a --
atf estimates there was enough semtex in that van
to level five square blocks .
anything on the victims ?
vaporized .
the presumed dead include two alabama state troopers
and the occupant of the van .
we just got footage of the explosion .
hold your fire ! it &apos;s just a --
it &apos;s just a what ?
the v.i.n. numbers on the van &apos;s differential
match a vehicle registered to kenyon &apos;s church of the shield .
judge is signing the search warrant as we speak .
also , the plates were swapped out
for one stolen off a cherokee
at a truck stop five miles down the road
from the kenyon compound .
i got a hit on another set of plates
stolen from the same location .
another van passed through a tollbooth
on the md 200 headed into d.c.
reddington was right .
if we &apos;d listened to him ,
we wouldn &apos;t have a gang of fanatics
joyriding with enough ordnance to level a small city .
ressler and keen , get to that compound .
the warrant should be sealed and delivered
by the time you arrive .
navabi , the van -- find out everything you can .
harold cooper .
dr. levin , hello .
w @-@ was i accepted ?
i see .
you know , jeff , you don &apos;t owe me an apology .
i know you did everything you could .
thank you .
hey , i just got off the phone with the doctor .
i &apos;m afraid it &apos;s ... bad news .
i am not taking you to st. petersburg .
you are if you want to know where the safe is .
how do i even know you &apos;ve found it ?
you don &apos;t .
but i got two weeks of vacation i got to take
before the end of the year or i lose it .
it &apos;s february !
we could take your jet ,
have a few laughs on the way ,
some of those nuts -- the honey @-@ roasted ones .
i want what i paid for --
the location of the safe .
can i be honest with you ?
i doubt it .
i &apos;ve never been out of the country .
my dad , our vacations as a kid ,
we drove everywhere --
south dakota , florida .
but you -- i look at you ...
and all the places you go ...
and i &apos;d just like to do that once .
plus , i think it &apos;d be fun .
i feel like we might have a good time .
i &apos;m screwing with you !
i was born in london ,
but i &apos;ve never been on a private jet .
anyway , i clock out at 5 : 30 .
i &apos;ll need to stop by the house ,
grab a shower ,
feed the turtle .
i can have a bag packed and be wheels up by 9 : 00 .
sheriff , have you met kenyon ?
he makes a habit of coming into town for breakfast .
he &apos;s a bit of a blowhard
but always friendly , cooperative .
plus , the church has provided volunteers for community events ,
search @-@ and @-@ rescue operations .
so , what are you suggesting --
we collar this guy
at the next rotary club pancake breakfast ?
i &apos;m suggesting he can be talked to .
he &apos;s reasonable ,
and i &apos;m suggesting you let my boys handle this
instead of lighting this whole mountain up
and starting world war ⅲ .
what are the odds we &apos;ll be met with armed resistance ?
it &apos;s a dead certainty .
you step one foot on kenyon &apos;s land
without his express consent , he &apos;ll put a bullet in you ,
badge or no badge .
now , we &apos;ve cleared the estimated kill zone ,
and we &apos;ve evacuated the surrounding areas .
we &apos;re waiting on a sniper team now .
hold your fire .
it &apos;s just ...
a kid .
it &apos;s just a kid .
excuse me , miss ?
take this .
hey , h @-@ hold on !
hey , halt ! no !
return to the firing line !
do not approach the suspect !
return to the firing line ! do not approach the suspect !
i &apos;m samar . what &apos;s your name ?
do you know what that does ?
you planned on killing a lot of people today .
was that your mission ?
it &apos;s not going to happen . do you see ?
they &apos;re all too far away .
there &apos;s no point now .
it &apos;s just the two of us out here .
if you push that button ...
only two of us are going to die .
do you understand ?
just you and me ,
and i don &apos;t want to die today .
do you ?
come on out .
come on .
come here , give me your hand .
it &apos;s gonna be okay .
go , go !
kenyon &apos;s unaccounted for .
53 of his followers slaughtered .
no sign of him .
that &apos;s puzzling .
it appears all the adults were murdered
and the children are gone .
kenyon &apos;s ideology has always been
about vanquishing the infidels and rising to power ,
not about killing their own .
this is a group of survivalists .
they might have been attacked by a rival militia .
we found a number of dead bodies surrounding the perimeter .
and the storage containers ?
located , secured , and searched --
about a dozen of them so far .
they &apos;ve been pretty much cleaned out --
no weapons , no ordnance .
according to an inventory list ,
we &apos;re missing small arms , rpgs ,
three hellfire missiles ,
plus over a ton of semtex ,
c4 , demex , and plastite .
what was that ?
that was ... a vase .
what about the vehicles ?
all the church &apos;s vehicles are accounted for ,
except for one .
another bomb .
something &apos;s gone sideways , lizzy .
kenyon is the devil we know ,
but now either others are involved
or there &apos;s been a complete breakdown in the organization .
either way , be careful out there .
you &apos;re sure this is the apartment ?
this is the apartment .
you &apos;re positive ?
your tone is insulting .
my tone ? !
i endured 13 hours with you on my jet ,
12 of which you had your shoes off .
you snored .
you insulted my flight attendant !
i thought she was pregnant .
glen , the safe !
we haven &apos;t found it yet , have we ? !
i know everything one can possibly know about alan fitch .
i worked on this &apos; round the clock ,
and you know how irritable i can be if i don &apos;t get my 10 hours .
i &apos;ve reviewed six years of bank records ,
and i traced the cash payment he made
to purchase an apartment in this very building
on this very floor .
trust me , the safe is here .
i don &apos;t trust you .
what the hell is this ?
the title to apartment 221 .
apology accepted .
what ?
we &apos;re in apartment 212 .
you don &apos;t know the cross that i bear ,
the things i &apos;ve had to overcome --
my dyslexia .
you &apos;re not dyslexic .
raymond .
oh , really , doctor ?
is that your professional opinion ?
forgot to pack my medication .
i was shocked when you told me i could come along .
it threw me .
i left my dyslexia pills on the counter .
there are no pills for dyslexia .
get this to sorenson for a trace on the number .
how old is he ?
he &apos;s 10 .
10 ?
what the hell are we dealing with here ?
i &apos;ve seen this before in fanatical sects .
the children are indoctrinated from the time they &apos;re born ,
force @-@ fed by rod and rote --
in this case , the gospel according to justin kenyon .
to rain fire upon the new babylon .
oh , my god -- coroner &apos;s preliminary report
on the massacre at the compound .
what do you got ?
not a shot was fired .
every single one of those people was stabbed ,
strangled , stomped , or bludgeoned to death .
dear god .
and something else .
a field office in richmond just got a call
from a former cult member --
dawn weston .
swears our truck bomber is her son .
she &apos;s our only surviving witness .
of a crime committed in my jurisdiction .
that makes her my responsibility .
look , these are dangerous people .
we have an entire unit
tasked with providing protective custody .
there &apos;s no point in hashing this out now .
no matter how this shakes down ,
the first thing we need to do
is get that girl safely off this mountain -- agreed ?
what are you looking at ?
watchers .
watchers ?
shh , it &apos;s a secret .
i thought he was dead .
your son , finnian .
finn , we always called him .
finn .
there are some things that you need to understand about justin ,
about the way that things were .
you see , h @-@ his word was not just the law .
it was the word of god himself .
justin was our oracle .
he was our burning bush .
i understand .
you don &apos;t .
you can &apos;t ,
not unless you were there . you ...
god , what have i done ?
tell me .
according to justin ...
each man was to take unto himself three wives .
which wasn &apos;t a problem in the early days ,
but as we began to have children ...
he must &apos;ve seen the flaw in his plan .
what flaw ?
there were too many boys , of course .
more than half the children were , you know , male , and so ...
he began the walkabout .
the walkabout ?
the first new moon in january ,
lots would be drawn among the boys .
we would have a great feast in celebration ,
and the chosen one would be the guest of honor .
he was treated as a man .
how old were the chosen ?
8 or 10 .
just before the onset of puberty .
after the feast , the boy would be awakened
and taken deep into the woods , and then ...
you left him there in the middle of nowhere ,
in the bitter cold .
he said there were too many .
you &apos;re hurt .
i &apos;m okay .
ressler &apos;s pinned .
ressler , talk to me ! you injured ?
i don &apos;t think anything &apos;s broke , but i &apos;m stuck .
i can &apos;t ... i can &apos;t budge this thing .
the radio &apos;s shot .
anybody got cell reception ?
mine &apos;s busted .
somebody live back there ?
not that i know of .
you wait by the car with amy .
i &apos;m gonna see if i can go get us some help ,
check out that smoke .
keep an eye on that girl .
shouldn &apos;t you be prepping for your confirmation hearing ?
it &apos;s a no @-@ brainer .
you &apos;re looking at the next attorney general .
i &apos;m happy for you , tom .
for us , harold , for us .
i want you to consider taking the director &apos;s chair .
tom , i don &apos;t know .
it &apos;s what we &apos;ve always talked about .
a rising tide lifts all boats .
i &apos;m flattered , tom .
but i can &apos;t .
i &apos;m not leaving here with a &quot; no . &quot;
i &apos;d love to take you up on this , tom .
you know i would .
but i &apos;m dealing with some ...
health issues .
what , harold ? is it serious ?
to be honest with you , yeah . it &apos;s very serious .
there was a clinical trial that held out some hope ,
but , uh ...
look , you didn &apos;t come here to talk about my health .
i &apos;m happy for you . i really am .
are you in the fbi ?
yes , i am .
my daddy says all the people who work for the fbi
are gonna go to hell .
some days it feels like that , sweetheart .
he says they &apos;re gonna burn in a lake of fire .
who &apos;s there ? !
what is it ?
hey , starkweather !
it &apos;s them .
who ?
the watchers .
sweetie , come here .
get down , get down !
the only cure for corruption is disruption .
the only cure for corruption is disruption .
the only cure for corruption is disruption .

the only cure -- - finn .
the father said to his servants , &quot; quick ,
put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet . &quot;
do you r @-@ remember me ?
mama ?
yes , finn .
you &apos;re telling me that this attack
was masterminded by a bunch of kids ?
not just kids -- a tribe ,
militarily instructed by their elders
from the time they could walk in tracking ,
evasion techniques ,
hand @-@ to @-@ hand combat , firearm training .
and left to die in the woods ?
starting with kenyon &apos;s own son , david .
why ? come on , keep going .
the gospel according to kenyon --
&quot; and each man shall have unto himself three wives . &quot;
there were too many boys .
it was the only way to maintain the ratio .
the mountain was supposed to kill the boys ,
but it didn &apos;t .
it was a crucible . the weak died --
injuries , disease , exposure ...
get out of here ! come on ,
get out !
... but the strong survived ,
perfectly adapted , with their own laws ,
their own society , their own gods ,
chief among which was justin kenyon .
&quot; was &quot; ?
david is their leader .
a few weeks ago , he declared his father an apostate .
he said that justin had abandoned his calling
and that it was up to them
to fulfill the prophecies of ken &apos;yon .
did he tell you where this final truck bomb was headed ?
the only people who know are the other drivers and david .
i can &apos;t raise liz or ressler .
samar , my dear ,
bump in the road i can help smooth over ,
or have the clouds finally parted
and this is a social call ?
she &apos;s missing .
agent keen ?
and ressler .
they were supposed to deliver a witness two hours ago .
they haven &apos;t been seen since they left kenyon &apos;s compound .
have you mounted a search ?
i &apos;m on my way out to assist hrt ,
but there are hundreds of square miles of rugged terrain .
it could take days .
the weapons .
agent keen said there was a complete inventory list .
you have it ?
well , we have a manifest . why ?
send it to me .
ressler !
raymond !
oh , that &apos;s a shame .
dendrobium ?
my own hybrid .
i call them &quot; snows of everest . &quot;
lovely .
friend of yours ?
a small accounting problem .
ruth .
ruth !
i &apos;m afraid i &apos;ll need your undivided attention .
put on his parka .
tie him from the back of the snowmobile .
i &apos;ll be out in a minute .
very well .
you have my attention .
ruth ...
i will be forever indebted to you
if you could be so kind as to provide me
with the activation codes for the hellfire missiles
you have stored at justin kenyon &apos;s compound .
yes .
are you navabi ?
yeah .
it &apos;s for you .
this is samar .
agent navabi , what do you know about hellfire missiles ?
what does that have to do with anything ?
quite a lot , actually .
there were three of them stolen from the compound .
i &apos;ve since acquired their activation codes .
you &apos;re going to launch three hellfire missiles ?
don &apos;t be silly .
we just activated the cameras in their nose cones .
i &apos;ve seen quite a lot of activity ,
but , then , boys will be boys .
liz and ressler ?
not sure .
i have ... two other views ,
only one of any tactical value .
it looks like they &apos;re in some sort of large hand @-@ built structure .
where ? - funny you should ask -- in standby mode ,
the guidance systems ping gps coordinates every 30 seconds .
you ready ?
go .
who are you ?
my name &apos;s elizabeth .
this isn &apos;t about me or the others , father .
this is about you -- your legacy , not mine !
you think i haven &apos;t seen it ?
read it ?
prevarications and betrayals .
tell me who you are .
you &apos;ve denied the lord
a thousand times ...
who &apos;s in charge ?
kenyon .
... spending too much time
i want to talk to him .
among the infidels ...
only david talks to kenyon .
you disgust me .
david ! david !
what ?
what ? !
the prisoner wants to talk to you .
caleb , watch the road .
make sure nobody else comes .
where are the others ?
amy &apos;s safe , along with the others .
she &apos;s gonna be one of my wives .
we &apos;re all gonna get married -- all of us .
as prescribed by kenyon .
and the man ? ressler ?
what have you done with him ?
see ?
he &apos;s alive .
freeze ! move away from him !
step away from him !
i said freeze !
federal agents ! get on the ground !
back off !
are you okay ?
yeah .
kenyon &apos;s upstairs .
get this guy right here .
get him out of here .
he &apos;s gone .
kenyon .
stand down ! we found the ...
what ?
the third van .
get these kids out of here !
see if you can locate those missing girls .
they &apos;ve got to be around here somewhere .
call for backup .
no backup !
just round up these kids
with the personnel we &apos;ve got and clear out .
yes , ma &apos;am .
don &apos;t come any closer !
i &apos;ve got 300 pounds of explosives in this van !
go ahead .
it &apos;s what he wanted , isn &apos;t it ?
what do you know ?
i know your father ...
wanted you dead .
he sent us out there to make us stronger ,
to be warriors , to fulfill his prophecy !
all those boys --
they wouldn &apos;t have made it if it weren &apos;t for you ,
taking them in , teaching them how to survive .
your father never wanted them .
he never wanted you .
but you &apos;re not your father , david .
you &apos;re better than him .
you &apos;re right .
i am .
coward !
atf &apos;s been over the grounds .
they &apos;ve searched the buried containers .
if you &apos;re wondering about what you stored there ,
it &apos;s long gone .
what &apos;s this ?
a key .
i bought you an apartment at the audrey ,
top floor , splendid view of the potomac .
why ?
it &apos;s time to leave the motel behind .
i &apos;m happy where i am . thank you .
you &apos;ve been many things lately , lizzy ,
but happy is not one of them .
that motor lodge you call home crushes the spirit ,
smothers the soul .
and you think a view is gonna change that ?
i once stayed at a villa in bali
with a view of the indian ocean .
every morning , all i saw before me was ...
possibility .
that and a gorgeous housekeeper named putu , who used to --
thanks , but , no , thanks .
i wish you &apos;d stop .
stop what ?
trying .
stop hoping things are gonna get better between us .
you and me , it &apos;s just business .
that &apos;s all it &apos;s ever gonna be .
single malt .
highland , if memory serves .
i got you in .
tom , i thought i was clear .
i appreciate you thinking i &apos;d be a good director , but --
screw the director . i got you into the trial .
at georgetown .
what ?
how ?
good questions .
i know a guy who knows a guy .
wait .
am i taking another patient &apos;s spot ?
because ... i couldn &apos;t accept that . that wouldn &apos;t be right .
righteous to the end .
relax .
it was going to be 35 patients , and now it &apos;ll be 36 .
thank you , tom .
there are good ships ...
and there are wood ships .
the ships that sail the sea .
but the best ships are friendships .
and may they always be .
the number from the safe traces to a blind exchange .
we can &apos;t identify the party you &apos;ll be speaking to .
yes .
i &apos;m calling on behalf alan fitch .
the safe .
you found the safe ?
who the hell is this ?
