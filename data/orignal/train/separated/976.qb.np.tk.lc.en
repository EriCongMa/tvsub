gaby discovered a secret
your stomache just kicked me
i want you to run the miami office .
so , carlos played hardball .
you can &apos;t fire me for being pregnant .
i &apos;m offering a promotion .
if you choose to turn it down and quit instead ,
i can &apos;t stop you
katherine broke down .
the man i love chose you . it &apos;s over .
why it &apos;s been so hard on me ?
you loved him .
i found a way to spring you from this marriage
karl had a plan
if he violates the parole by
associating with a known felon , they can revoke it .
all we need to do is
get some ex @-@ con in a room with orson
take some pictures and it &apos;s bye bye , orson
it &apos;s perfect ! and he will have to let me go
nick made a call .
agent padilla ? i am thinking about coming in .
and evil
did you forget something ?
return to the neighborhood
what are you doing ?
her name was emily portsmith .
and the word of her death spread quickly .
you see , everyone in town knew emily .
her family was well @-@ known and respected
she &apos;d been popular in school ...
and her customers at the coffee shop adored her .
people were shocked to hear she &apos;d been murdered .
mostly because
another young woman was attacked just a few weeks before .
yes , everyone in fairview now knew
a killer is walking among them .
and they would soon learn ...
he wasn &apos;t finished .
the next day , the woman of wisteria lane
got togehther for their weekly poker game .
but as it turned out ,
no one is in the mood to gamble .
the girl in the coffee shop was strangled
and julie was attacked in the same way .
there is obviously a mad man on the loose .
i am afraid to leave my house at night .
at least now you have a boyfriend to protect you .
roy ? the man threw out his back peeling an orange .
i am on my own here .
so what we do to protect ourselves ?
down at the hospital where i work ,
they offer a self @-@ defense class .
maybe we should consider taking that .
that &apos;s a good idea .
i guess we could .
but you know my motto . .38 special is a girl &apos;s best friend .
ohh , i love the pearl handle .
it would look so good with my white suit .
susan , you should feel it . it &apos;s so light .
i don &apos;t touch guns anymore . not since
i accidently grazed katherine .
still go with &quot; accidently , &quot; are we ?
oh , hey , honey , we are all gonna take a self @-@ defense class .
are you coming with us ?
yeah , it might make you feel safer
well , i was taking out the trash when i was attacked .
he came out of nowhere .
and i blacked out before i knew what was happening .
if someone really wants to get you ,
they can get you .
i am off . you &apos;re still sewing penny &apos;s costume ?
yeah , but i am reading the sports page while i am doing it .
so they kinda cancel each other out .
oh ... ahem , i got you this ... a pricy bourbon .
it &apos;s 8 : 45 in the morning and i am pregnant .
i think i will pass .
for carlos . it &apos;s a sorry @-@ i @-@ lied @-@ about @-@ being @-@ pregnant gift .
i don &apos;t need that . i know carlos .
he loses his temper . then , he calms down
and thinks rationally . good @-@ bye .
i &apos;d still bring the booze .
i am telling you . i am too valuable right where i am .
there is no way he &apos;s gonna try to send me to florida .
bon voyage !
what &apos;s going on ?
carlos told us about the promotion in florida . congradulations !
you &apos;re gonna be so missed around here .
lynette , where are you going ? rita wrote you a good @-@ bye poem .
can i see you in my office please ?
what are you thinking you are doing ? you know i am not moving to florida .
okay , so we just change the bannner to read &quot; good luck and so long &quot;
no , it needs to read &quot; i told you i am not leaving .
someone get me a bagel . &quot;
lynette , what can i tell you ?
we have an opening for you in florida branch .
but here you job is already been given to tim .
tell tim you made a mistake .
i can &apos;t do that .
so i guess this leaves you no choice but to quit .
look , i know what you are doing . and i am not going for it .
you wanna me gone . you are gonna have to fire me .
and open myself to a lawsuit by firing a pregnant woman ?
i don &apos;t think so .
then if you don &apos;t mind , i have work to do .
hey , these aren &apos;t my kids .
no , those are tim &apos;s kids .
this is his office now .
so ... what office will i be using
are you kidding me ? these twins have a bigger office .
enjoy
how you doing ?
i am okay .
everybody seems to think whoever killed emily
was probably the same person who attacked me .
yeah , that &apos;s what plice are saying .
and i think we should do everything we can to help them .
meaning what ?
maybe now it &apos;s the time to tell them the married man you were seeing .
he has nothing to do with it .
you don &apos;t know that . man who cheats sometimes have
more than one girlfriend .
mom , listen ,
there is no way he could ever hurt someone , much less kill them .
okay
if you &apos;re sure .
i am
i mean ... why would he attack me
and then wanna get back together
wait . have you started seeing him again ?
no .
julie .
even if i did , it is my life , right ?
that &apos;s right . it is your life .
is it just me or was life
much less complicated when you were seven ?
sorry i grew up
me too
police are concerned that the strangling
of portsmith is connected to a similar attact
on a fairview woman earlier this year
anyone with information is been asked to call
just think ... if the cops hadn &apos;t wasted
so much time on danny
they might have got this guy
before he did this again , right ?
what ?
i was there .
you were where ?
the coffee shop
i got there right when the girl was clsoing up .
oh please be kidding .
nah , i wish i was .
and i &apos;m pretty sure i was the last customer .
but did anybody see you ?
no , i don &apos;t think so .
but that doesn &apos;t mean the cops
won &apos;t figure out that i was there
and if they do ...
yeah they &apos;re gonna wanna come
and talk to you again and ... maybe run you prints .
yeah . that &apos;s what i was thinking .
i was also thinking that maybe we shouldn &apos;t
wait around for that to happen
no . i &apos;m not moving again , not this time
look , angie ... ange ... ange , will you just let me finish ?
no , no , no , nick , i like this place !
i have friends , i have a job .
i ... i feel like a real person here again .
after 18 years of being a ghost , i don &apos;t wanna give that up
fine
all right , maybe we &apos;ll get lucky and the cops just won &apos;t come
but honestly , i don &apos;t know how much more luck we got left .
hello , are you lamar benjamin ?
you got a warrant ?
oh no , i &apos;m not with the police
my name is bree hodge . you know my husband
orson from the state penitentiary
do you have a moment ?
i got nothing but moment
so you are mrs. hodge .
damn , flossy did ok for himself
floosy ?
that &apos;s how we called orson
&apos;cause he got us all dental floss .
and then nagged us to use it every meal
i see
pain in the ass
i was glad when someone used it to
strangle a guy and then they took it all away
so how &apos;s orson doing
well , to be honest lamar
life on the outside &apos;s been a little hard for him
people can be so judgemental
about men who have served time .
if you were repeat offender , you can forget it
yes . well ...
i &apos;ve heard orson speak very fondly
of his prison friends especially you
really ? &apos; cause he seemed kind of mad
when i used him as a shield in the yard fight
lamar he just tells that story now and laughs and laughs
anyway , he &apos;s been feeling a little blue and i was hoping
you would pay him a visit and cheer him up
sorry . i &apos;ll be breaking my parole
they catch me hanging out with an ex @-@ cons
they can send me back to jail
really ? that &apos;s a silly rule
don &apos;t worry though . our house is
on the end of a very quiet cul @-@ de @-@ sac .
no one would even know you stop by
and of course i would compensate you for your time
and another three when you come
what the hell . no harm in a little social call
but you can &apos;t tell anybody i came
when you get to know me better , lamar
you &apos;ll find i have no trouble keeping secrets
hey . what are you doing here ?
your mom told me you were upset
i told her i know how to make you feel better
mint chocolate chip ? thanks daddy
i know this one &apos;s gonna take a lot more than ice cream
i keep thinking about him
he &apos;s out there and ..
maybe he &apos;s thinking about me
honey , honey , he &apos;s not
he knows where i live . he knows what kind of car i drive
i &apos;ve been wanting to go to the library
but i &apos;m afraid he &apos;s gonna follow me
look if you &apos;re worried about your car
why don &apos;t we switch for a while ?
seriously ? i drive your fancy car
and you &apos;d drive my tiny little compact ?
hey there &apos;s nothing i would not do for my little ...
you have air conditioner , right ?
yeah . there &apos;s nothing i would not do for my little girl
are you ok ?
i &apos;m just having a bad day
my life &apos;s gotten sort of ... complicated
why
oh it &apos;s ... grown @-@ up relationship stuff ,
you wouldn &apos;t understand
okay
but
since you asked
so i think you &apos;re gonna have fun at brandon &apos;s party
i heard there &apos;s gonna be a pony
hey , you ok ?
i &apos;m worried about mrs. mayfair
why ?
she &apos;s not getting any younger
and it &apos;s really hard to meet guys in this town
where did you hear that ?
she told me
she also said mommy stole you
from her and that makes mommy a bad person
buddy , your mommy is a great person
now why you , sign brandon &apos;s card , okay ?
and i &apos;ll be right back
mike , watch it
did you actually tell my six @-@ year @-@ old son
that his mother &apos;s a bad person
well , i would have used more colorful language
but like you said , he is only six
you &apos;ve never seen me get angry
but if you want to ,
just talk to my son one more time
then you &apos;ll know what i am capable of
mike , i love mj ...
i ... would never do anything to hurt him
one more time
oh ... julie ... no
hello .
hi , it &apos;s your mother
am i interrupting anything ?
no , i am just at the library
oh , really ? the library .
yeah . i thought i dive into an old favorite
any vice versa , i am sure
hum ?
honney , i don &apos;t blame you . you got back to that place ,
beacause it seems safe and comforting . am i right ?
i guess .
but trust me , it &apos;s a bad idea
can we talk about this later , i only have one hour , i really want to finish
ok , i want you to out of there right now
mom , i &apos;ll see you soon
you bet you will .
you &apos;ve been a busy girl
you got the ex @-@ con booked ,
hidden cameras all set up
come friday night , showtime
so what &apos;s the matter
we should be celebrating
i just hope we both clear that
that these photos are strickly for blackmail
of course , we are not actually gonna send him to prison
unless , i mean , we have to
no , carl , even if he calls our bluff , we are not gonna turn him in
excuse me , i am looking for the person
that belongs to the blue car
she is red head
with a man ?
yeah , she is with a man . the redhead is my daughter
your daughter ? damn , you look good .
thank you .
so , can you tell me what room they are in
i may not love him anymore ,
but i am not gonna win my freedom by taking away this
now you are angry
bree , when you tell me you could
never hurt the man you used to love
it doesn &apos;t make me angry
it just reminds me why i love you so much
don &apos;t you worry , no one is gonna get hurt
oh , oh , my god , oh , my god
hey , eric , can you tell carlos
i &apos;m here for lunch , i &apos;m gonna run to the ladies &apos;s room
i &apos;ll tell him
hi , lynette .
hey , gaby .
i &apos;d ask you in , but i don &apos;t think
there is enough oxgeon here for the both of us
no.it &apos;s ... comfy
hey , i get that carlos is trying to punish me ,
but enough is enough , you gotta talk to him
lynette , you never even came to talk to me that you are pregnant
i think this is between you and carlos
ok , i know you are upset
but me keeping my pregnancy a seacret wasn &apos;t personal
wasn &apos;t it ?
no , listen to me tom and i are still in debt
i need this promotion and
carlos had already passed over a coworker
beacase she was preganant
i couldn &apos;t risk telling him
oh , beacause you thought
i &apos;ll talk to carlos , he &apos;d to fire you ?
yes .
so , clearly
i wasn &apos;t enough a friend for you to trust me
no .
but now , i am such a good friend ,
i am the only one who can fix it for you ?
i guess you are not going to talk to carlos
good guess
can &apos;t believe she is dead
i know , i just saw her a few days ago
talked about going to the mall
who found her ?
the assistant manager
i was there yesterday , i mean , thank god ,
it would &apos;ve freaked me out .
we are just talking about emily
yeah , i didn &apos;t really know her ,
but i guess we are sort of connected now
you would like her , she &apos;s super nice
i gotta go home ,
my mom was so freaked out .
it could be minished , if she wants me to be around
i &apos;ll give you a ride
wish you go too , danny
hum ... you go ahead
but , don &apos;t you need a ride ?
no , i &apos;ll walk .
i just want to talk to julie .
so do you want to get something to eat ?
thanks , but i &apos;m not hungry .
well , maybe you want to go to emily &apos;s funeral together ?
everybody is going .
danny , i know you like me .
but i can &apos;t hang out with you
why not ?
i just can &apos;t , it &apos;s complicated .
cause you slept with my dad , isn &apos;t it ?
who told you that ?
i figured it out a while ago .
if you know that ? why in the world ...
cause i like you ... a lot .
do you not see how weird that is ?
no , it &apos;s ok . cause i &apos;ve foggiven you .
that &apos;s nice , but it &apos;s still weird .
julie , please , i wanna be with you .
danny , i am so sorry , but that is never going to happen .
come on , they are gonna come , they gonna come .
i feel like i &apos;ve been spending my entire life
looking out of window .
maybe , it &apos;s time we stop .
what are you saying ?
i am saying it &apos;s time we thought about coming in .
please tell me you didn &apos;t talk to them .
oh , my god .
calm down , all right ? i was not an idiot .
i used the prepay in the call and
it lasted less than a minute .
there is no way they are ever going to find us .
but still they know we are alive .
don &apos;t you want to know
if they are ready to make a deal ?
i killed a man , they &apos;ll be ready to make a deal
when i got a needle in my arm and
my elbows are rolled back in my head .
you don &apos;t know that .
you are never going to talk that again .
do you hear me ?
i still can &apos;t get that image of lynette out of my head .
and she is missing in that cramping office
with hands of william wood chips .
yeah , i figure a couple of more days of this
should be ready to back all these things .
she does deserve this , right ?
she lied when she took the promotion .
what if her doctor had put her on bed rest ,
or what if i needed her to fly somewhere .
that would put the whole company in jeopardy .
given that never happened ,
you were saying she was doing a good job and
now you are just doing all these mean things to her ?
me ? this was your idea ,
you wanted to put some snake in her office .
rubber snakes .
we &apos;re completely justified here .
oh , you &apos;re right .
which is why we have the opportunity
to do something we never do , carlos .
forgive .
seriously ?
tom and lynette have been our friends for 15 years .
they gave us sausages of the month last chrismas .
those were good sausages .
i know lynette ,
she would never set out
to intentionally heart us .
i gotta admit , that i started to miss those guys .
you should &apos;ve seen her when i was leaving her office .
check the look in your eyes , she was so defeated .
you should &apos;ve seen the look in her eyes , it was like
screw you lynette , i win .
so that &apos;s when you call the lawyer ?
oh , yes . i &apos;m still not getting away with this .
they are not gonna harass me ,
i &apos;m going to sue their ass and
carlos is being served papers tomorrow .
wow , you really got work up here .
we are not having angery sex .
just that i asked .
what i did tell you about putting away those clothes ?
i &apos;m serious . nap time is over .
danny ? danny ! no , no , no , no , no , no . nick !
any woman can be the victim of a violent crime .
that is why it is necessary
to learn how to defend yourself .
in parking lot , in a park , on your own driveway ,
an attack can happen anywhere ,
it only takes several seconds .
sorry i &apos;m late , i had three parties to prepare for .
how tired that must be for you , juggling all those affairs .
ok , everyone , team up .
i want you to do attacker or victim .
hi , gaby , you wanna attack me ?
oh , ms. mmcclusky , i don &apos;t want to hurt you .
oh , please i &apos;ve eaten burgers bigger than you are .
bring it on .
all right , granny , prepared to break a hip .
so , we are supposed to be partners ,
do you want to attack me ?
i could be persuaded .
now , attackers , i want you to approach your victim .
freakishly stronger lady , here .
i credited the bran .
oh , that &apos;s very impressive . but the rest of you ,
approach your victim from behind placing in a choke hold .
now victims , your impulse will be to pull away , wrong
you just choke harder .
instead you want to push back on your attacker
using your weight of pushing them off balance .
susan , a little tight .
oh , i &apos;m sorry .
you feel so bad ?
being betrayed by someone you trusted that hurt you ?
what are you talking about ?
i know about you and carl .
oh , no .
oh , yeah , traitor .
stop it .
you can &apos;t talk in that way at the time of an attack .
jab your elbows .
i &apos;m trying to .
how could you , you know ,
how carl treated me .
i &apos;m sorry but if you ...
let me explain .
ok , now , attackers and victims switch .
you don &apos;t wanna switch ?
not now , i &apos;m not letting you get behind you ,
you &apos;ve already stabbed me in the back .
ms. delfino , release your victim , please .
she is not the victim here .
what about orson ? how could you do this to him ?
you don &apos;t know about my marriage .
orson , orson is putting me through hell this year .
too tight .
susan , i know you are angery .
but carl means more to me than just a fling and
i &apos;m not giving him up .
so if that means our friendship is over ?
but that &apos;s your decision , not mine .
you &apos;re going ? we are just getting started .
i know but i think i &apos;ve defended myself enough for one day .
i just got a call from the lawyer ,
they &apos;re going to sue carlos in any minute .
wow , you &apos;re really going through this , uh ?
yeah ,
we are not bad people , are we tom ?
what carlos is doing to you is totally unfair and illegal .
no , we are good people .
right , he started it . screw him .
what &apos;s all this ?
candy , flowers , baby gifts .
sort of my way of saying &quot; i &apos;m sorry . &quot;
here are some crap to prove it .
really ?
yeah , i don &apos;t want to fight anymore .
and neither does carlos . so we are hoping we can talk .
oh , gaby , i &apos;m so happy .
here , take it , it &apos;s getting heavy .
i missed you .
lynette ?
honey , we are having a moment here , please don &apos;t spoil it .
i &apos;m not what &apos;s gonna spoil it .
could you ? hold on a second .
i &apos;m just i &apos;m gonna make a quick phone call .
you know guys , i don &apos;t care what happens ,
let &apos;s not let anything interfere
our relationship ever again .
remember you said that .
answer the phone , answer the phone .
what ?
oh , it &apos;s carlos . wondering what he wants .
gaby , you know ,
what you said about our friendship before .
no , no , no .
let &apos;s just make a pact . we should ...
hi , baby , what &apos;s up ?
i would never forgive you for this .
gaby , please , what about our pact
we &apos;d never make a pact . here , mj , catch .
you have to understand
i was just pretending to protect myself .
oh , ladies , what &apos;s new ?
lynette is suing carlos , here .
once you apologied , i tried to call the guy off .
lynette , you wanted to sue us that
proved you are not my friend .
hi , karen , here &apos;s some candy .
i &apos;d rather cut down .
really ? at your age , why bother ?
please i need to talk to you .
no , you need to talk to my lawyer .

susan , i was into this with my eyes wide open

unfortunately , i told you that i needed them by nine
was that not clear ?
crystal clear .
it was impossible to get all worked done in a night .
carlos , you know that when you gave it to me
well , it wouldn &apos;t be impossible ,
if you skipped your daughter &apos;s pageant .
i know you went
anyway , this is very painful for me
but i have no other choice but to terminate an employeer .
you &apos;re really going to do this ?
i believe i &apos;m with my legal rights .
you need to clear up your personal belongings
within an hour , mrs scavo .

i needed to talk to him , mike .

his mother lies to him .
he needs to know that what you and i had was real .
you and i had nothing .
how can you say that ?
it &apos;s true .
the whole time i was with you ,
all i thought about was susan .
everytime i held you ,
everytime i kissed you ,
all i was thinking was , god , i wish you were susan .
if you mean it ,
please kill me .
it would be less painful .
i don &apos;t care enough about you to kill you .
the world is a dangerous place ,
and we must learn to defend ourselves
from those who want to hurt us .
that stranger without a name ,
an employeer who holds a garage ,
the husband who won &apos;t let go .
yes , we all try to defend ourselves so we won &apos;t get hurt .
yes , i need an ambulance right away .
4356 wisteria lane . please hurry .
i &apos;m losing a lot of blood .
until we realize , our pain
