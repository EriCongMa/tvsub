It's time for the contest
that's taking America by storm, "Stop that deejay."
Fine. Bring it on, chump.
So we got through the holidays in one piece, right?
But the big bearded guy in the red suit
deserves one last trivia shout-out.
Now, we know he didn't deliver all these presents by himself.
So, name for me all of Santa's 9 reindeer.
Oh, I know this. Prancer, Dancer--
"Forgive me, sweetheart.
I tried to make it right."
Hey, Dave, take a look at this, would you?
This arrived at my house last night.
It's a gift from Harrison Scott.
Your buddy from Vietnam.
"Appreciate everything you've done for me."
The grips are a replica of the Vietnam War Memorial.
It's beautiful.
It's expensive.
What's the matter?
A gift like this
would practically drain all of Harrison's savings.
Now, if you're trying to get yourself back on your feet,
why would you do something like that?
You talk to him?
I left 3 messages where he lives
at new directions for veterans.
He hasn't returned my calls.
That's only been since last night.
I phoned his job this morning.
He hasn't shown up for work the past two days, either.
I'm worried, Aaron.
Why don't you go out to Los Angeles and check on him.
What about our caseload?
It'll be fine. You've got leave coming.
You should go.
Maybe I'll do that. Thank you.
Sure.
It's staged.
They got people on those programs
they know are gonna fight.
You should've seen that guy's wife
when he brought his two girlfriends out on the stage.
Hoo hoo hoo. Punches flying everywhere.
It's a TV show.
It's fake.
Whoa. Your ass just got checkmated, homes.
It's checkers, not chess.
King me.
Well, here's the problem, your majesty.
This right here where you're playing--
this is our office.
You want to come here, play a little game,
you gotta pay us rent.
I said king me.
I ain't kidding, old-timer.
Cough it up, wallet and watch, both of you.
I faced a lot worse than you in Korea.
You two-bit punks don't scare me.
Oh, yeah?
Well, I can get a whole lot scarier than this, grandpa.
What's going on?
We've got a possible spree killer in Cleveland.
Details are sketchy, but 90 minutes ago
a man shot and killed two gang members
at a park on the outskirts of the city.
Why are we thinking spree?
I mean, gang members shoot each other all the time.
Because a third gang member fled the scene,
the shooter hunted him down at a gas station
over a mile away to finish the job.
Not your typical M.O. for a gang shooting.
Oh, and there's more.
After the third gang member was killed,
a fourth person was shot and killed at a bus stop
less than a half a mile away from the gas station.
Also gang related?
I don't know. Details still coming in.
4 homicides, 3 locations, all within 90 minutes.
We need to hurry. Wheels up in 15.
I'll let Morgan know.
Can I help you with something, sir?
How much ammunition can I buy?
Well, depends how much you need.
Those.
That's 19.95.
I'm gonna need a lot more than that.
Ok.
The Road Home
"Beware the fury of a patient man."
John Dryden.
You know, the description of our unsub is pretty vague.
40s, 50s, rumpled clothing
like he could have been slept in.
And two witnesses in the park
said he appeared to have been drinking.
They could smell alcohol on him.
The first 3 victims all had police records--
car theft, aggravated assault, and drug dealing.
If they involve drugs, the unsub might be a disgruntled customer.
Sorry. Babysitting issues at home.
Garcia, did we get confirmation that the fourth victim
at the bus stop was not gang affiliated?
That is correct, sir. Paul Haller, high school senior.
Not an angel, though.
Haller has a few minor robbery arrests from the past,
and police found a wallet on his body,
cash and credit cards belonging to a Sita Patel.
Purse-snatching?
Gang members, mugger.
We might be looking at a vigilante.
All right, I just got off the phone with Cleveland P.D.
If we are dealing with a spree killer,
at least he's on a slower boil now.
No new incidents reported in the past hour.
The victim at the gas station wasn't just shot.
The body showed signs of having been run over multiple times
by a large vehicle.
That is one way to put the "over" in overkill.
Morgan, you and JJ go to
the park where the first shooting took place.
Blake, go to the gas station crime scene,
and as soon as we can find Sita Patel,
Reid and I will talk to her,
see if she interacted with the unsub.
I was walking to work.
The boy grabbed my handbag,
and then when I tried to hold on, he yanked hard,
and I fell.
Did anyone else see the attack?
Many people. But they did nothing.
Nobody stayed to help?
Only one, a man.
Did he say anything to you?
He asked me which direction the boy went.
I told him and he left.
Did the man leave on foot or in a vehicle?
I didn't see.
He was very calm.
Calm and determined.
All right, thanks for your help.
Will you have your driver call me if he remembers anything else?
Appreciate that.
Well, not exactly an outpouring of grief from the locals.
Victims were bad news.
Take a look at this.
The street sweeper had to go around
whatever was parked here.
I just got off the phone with the street-sweeping team.
They said their truck passed by approximately 15 minutes
before the 911 call came in about the shooting.
That means the car was obviously parked there then,
but gone before the police responded.
Do we have a vehicle description?
They said it was a two-tone brown and beige SUV.
Out of state plates, and no license number.
Street-sweeping team said the car
was packed full of boxes and clothes.
The unsub was described as looking disheveled.
All right, so was the person in the car
a witness to the killings
or was he the killer himself?
So, Harrison didn't give you any indication where he might have gone?
No. We asked his roommates, checked the local jails
and hospitals. Nothing.
Did you or anybody else
notice a change in him recently?
Mr. Scott did seem a little different, now that you mention it.
In what way? Angry? Depressed?
No. We see a lot of that here
and know how to deal with it.
No, with Mr. Scott it was...
I don't know. He'd stare right through you,
like his mind was a million miles away.
Were any of his clothes or personal belongings missing?
It's hard to say.
Our participants have so few possessions to begin with.
Ms. Grant, give me a chance to find him,
to try to convince him to come back.
We have a very long waiting list,
so, unfortunately,
our policy about unauthorized absences is very strict.
After 3 days, the participant loses their spot.
Mr. Scott's been gone two days already,
so that leaves you less than 24 hours.
I--
Thank you.
Ok, honey.
All right, bye-bye.
Terry?
What are you doing here?
Terry, you're not supposed to be here. You know that.
Terry--terry, please. Terry, no, don't.
Don't! Don't! Don't do this!
Terry, stop!
Terry, no! Stop, Terry! Stop!
A restraining order?
I'll call the cops on you. I swear it!
This was sent to me at my job.
In front of my clients, in front of my--
That's 'cause you never opened the door to the process server!
You shut up!
No!
What do you think about that restraining order now?
Who the hell are you?
Get your hand off her neck.
Just go back to your cardboard box.
This doesn't concern you.
I said beat it.
Sir-- ohh!
Anything from Sita Patel?
The man who asked which way the purse-snatcher went
matches the description of the unsub.
How did it go at the gas station?
Maybe it's just me, but if I saw a person gunned down
and run over by a car a half a dozen times, I'd remember it.
Let me guess--witnesses are drawing a blank.
"It all happened so fast."
No surveillance cameras at the gas station either.
It's a high-crime area and the victims were criminals.
The neighborhood could be looking at this as a problem solved.
There's been another shooting.
My ex grabbed my throat,
and the next thing I know, this guy was in the yard
and he shot Terry and he took off.
Can you describe the other guy?
No. Everything happened so fast.
Coins were found scattered all around the area,
like somebody emptied out their pockets?
I didn't notice.
So when we analyze the coins,
we won't find trace evidence of you or your ex on them--
no fingerprints--
Ok. Yeah, I think Terry may have thrown some coins at the guy.
Well, when we get back to the station,
you can help the police artist render a likeness?
No.
Excuse me?
You have no idea what it's been like.
The past two years I wake up every morning scared to death.
Terry was crazy violent
and nobody would do a single thing about it.
He was issued a restraining order.
Oh, yeah. You saw how restrained he was.
You want to see what he did once?
I was cooking dinner,
he got mad and threw scalding oil at me.
Did you press charges?
Terry told everyone it was an accident.
That I dropped a frying pan.
But the police would have investigated, Madison.
Terry's Mr. Charity Fund-raiser,
all-around good guy at the country club.
It was my word against his.
Please, give me a break.
But it's over now,
thanks to that guy.
I hope you don't find him.
Whoever it was,
I hope he gets away.
What the hell are you doing here?
We need to talk.
I got nothin' to say. Now get the hell out of here.
What are you gonna do, Harrison?
Punch me?
Hit me over the head with that lamp?
What happened?
You came a long way for nothing. That's what happened.
It's been a long time since I've been in here.
What, 35 years, maybe more?
There used to be a pinball machine over there.
I see you're traveling light.
Packed what I needed.
Don't see anything else.
Like I said,
packed what I needed.
Do I need to search this room for a weapon?
I did not come here to blow my brains out, Dave.
How the hell did you know that I'd be here?
Educated guess. No money, no car.
I figured you'd find someplace cheap and familiar.
As you know, we were stationed at Pendleton.
We spent a lot of time here before we shipped out.
So, when I called and found out
that your old pal Pete still owned this place--
The way you sniff people out,
I should've recommended you to recon division back in 'nam.
The seal on that is not broken.
You can check.
I haven't had a drop in 14 months.
But you brought it along just in case.
A person doesn't need to pull the trigger of a gun to kill himself.
Why, Harrison? You were doing so well.
I got no answer for that.
I come to the end of my road, Dave.
I'm just sorry you had to come so far to see it.
There's somebody at the door.
Go check.
Yeah, who is it?
You know who it is.
What's going on?
I don't know. It looks like some older dude.
What's the problem, man? We're busy in there.
You know who I am.
Hell, no . Am I supposed to?
I know who you are.
Good for you. Now mosey your ass back out of here.
I've been waiting a long time for this.
Victims were small-time meth dealers,
been in and out of jail for years.
What do you got?
Garcia patched in surveillance video from the hallway camera.
It's our unsub.
He walks straight to the meth dealers' apartment,
and that's consistent with his M.O. of targeting criminals.
But he stumbled on the first victims by chance.
He sought these out.
He's evolving.
Garcia's trying to pull
surveillance video from the surrounding area.
We're looking for a two-tone suv with out of state plates.
He looks straight into the camera.
He doesn't care who sees him.
You should eat.
Nah, not hungry.
Well, I'll save you some kung pao beef.
It's a little chewy, but,
"The early bird gets the worm,
but the second mouse gets the cheese."
No.
Want to hear yours? It's pretty good.
Those hills there.
What about 'em?
My son Thomas and his wife
live on the other side of those hills.
In Carlsbad.
The son you haven't spoken to in a while?
19 years.
I called him out the blue the other day.
What'd he say?
Hello.
Goodbye.
Don't call again.
That was the gist of it.
I got a grandson
I didn't even know about, Dave.
I could hear him talking in the background.
Grandson
on the other side of the hill.
I ain't never gonna see him.
Let's go, then.
No point.
Permission to state the obvious, sir.
Permission denied.
You spent the last of your money to come down here.
That's not someone who's throwing in the towel.
That's someone
who wants another chance.
I don't know, Cruz.
We could be here another day or two.
Why don't you send me a secure contact number
and I'll get back--
Ok, yeah. Well, you tell him mommy misses him.
Talk to you soon.
What have you got, Garcia?
As your gigantic brain suspected, sir,
a two-tone suv with Florida plates
was parked across the street from the apartment building.
Were you able to pull a plate?
The suv is registered to a Clifford Walsh.
Do you have an address?
Nothing local.
Walsh moved out of the area a long time ago.
And if you hate sad stories as much as I do,
you should leave the room right now, 'cause this one's super sad.
10 years ago Walsh lost his wife and his 14-year-old son
in a home invasion robbery.
Here in Cleveland?
Yeah.It looks like the motive was stealing stuff.
Jewelry has taken out of the home,
and there was an attempted sexual assault on Mrs. Walsh.
Where was Walsh at the time of the home invasion?
He was working as a night supervisor
of a tool and die plant in Strongville,
which is just outside the city.
Did they get the killer?
Yeah, very next day.
Howard Clark, 18 years old.
High as a kite on meth at the time of the attack.
He was only sentenced to 10 years in prison.
The meth angle is interesting.
Did Clark have any connection with the victims in the apartment?
Yeah. He was buddies with Dane Hendrix, one of the victims.
10 years. That's awfully lenient for a double homicide.
You think? Maybe that's why Walsh went into a total tailspin.
He started drinking, quit his job, moved to Florida.
He's been like borderline homeless for many, many years.
When did he come back to Cleveland?
Last week. He cashed out his meager savings account
and headed north.
Here is what's interesting about the timing of this, though.
Howard Clark, the guy who killed Walsh's wife and son,
he was scheduled to be released 3 months from now,
but he was killed in a random prison fight
in the exercise yard the day before Walsh left Florida.
That must have been the trigger-- Clark's death--
That stirred up all memories.
And the memories brought him back to Cleveland.
But for what purpose?
The man we're looking for is Clifford Walsh.
The photograph you have of him was taken last year.
Walsh's family died in a home invasion robbery 10 years ago.
The killer was a man named Howard Clark.
But Clark's recent death
in prison may have triggered Walsh's spree.
The first 5 murders appear to be opportunistic kills,
but all the victims have
criminal records or a history of domestic violence.
The shooting at the meth apartment, however,
was premeditated and calculated.
One of the victims was Dane Hendrix,
a friend of Howard Clark's at the time of the home invasion.
Targeting Hendrix means Walsh might now
be trending towards more mission-oriented behavior.
Walsh has no concerns about keeping his identity
or movements secret.
In some ways his recklessness works in our favor.
He's out in the open. Here I am. Come and get me.
But this is a man who's lost his family
and feels he has nothing to lose.
He doesn't care about repercussions,
which makes him the most dangerous kind of spree killer.
Time is of the essence. Thank you.
Agent Hotchner.
We found Walsh's vehicle.
"Forgive me, sweetheart.
I tried to make it right."
Suicide note?
Walsh may have been about to kill himself
and saw the thugs hassling the old man.
But he killed them instead. Well, that makes sense.
The line between suicidal and homicidal ideation is pretty thin.
Look at this.
Is he counting something down?
The number sequence starts at 3,553 and ends...
at 87.
Clark was killed on January 14th...
87 days before his scheduled release date of April 11th.
Working backwards and taking into account
the 2009, 2012 leap years, 3,553 days...
April 9, 2004, the exact day Clark began his prison term.
So Walsh was waiting for Clark to be released
to take revenge on him.
And suddenly the object of his vengeance was gone.
But Walsh's need for justice wasn't.
His revenge has simply found another outlet.
We need to see if any cars have been reported stolen
in the area in the last couple hours.
If Walsh is swapping out vehicles,
it would be the first indication
he's cared enough to take evasive action.
Something else must be on the menu.
Something important enough that
he can't risk being caught.
We need to figure out who's next on Walsh's list of targets.
You know, Walsh lost his wife and his child.
He could be looking to balance the books.
Clark did get a light sentence.
Walsh might have a grudge
against the judge or surviving jury members.
We need to get those names, as well as the defense attorney
and anyone who testified on Clark's behalf.
The newspaper reports at the time
suggested Clark might have had an accomplice.
It was just a rumor, but it was a persistent one.
Maybe it was Dane Hendrix, the meth dealer?
No, he had a solid alibi for the night of the home invasion.
Clark always said he acted alone, but still...
We need to locate and get
all of these people into protective custody.
This ain't gonna work, Dave.
Wait here.
Can I help you?
Thomas Scott?
Yes.
My name is David Rossi.
I'm a friend of your father's.
Did he send you?
No.
All I'm asking is a few minutes of your time.
May I come in?
Don't take this wrong,
but we've got nothing to talk about.
Tommy...
Please.
Nothing in Walsh's background
hinted at this type of psychotic break.
Testimonials all reported him
as a solid, loving family man.
He supported his wife while she went through
a brief bout of depression.
When his son had problems at school,
he took him to one of those expanded horizon treks.
You know, the second intruder theory has some validity.
How so?
Because Walsh's wife was athletic
and his son played junior varsity football.
Meaning it might have been hard for Clark to subdue them both.
Especially if his faculties were diminished by drugs at the time.
And mother and son were found
at opposite sides of the house.
You're right, Hotch. Someone might have been helping Clark.
Mr. Hines?
Yes. Can I help you with something?
You know who I am.
No. Sorry.
I know who you are.
Look, I think you got the wrong place--
I've been waiting a long time for this.
Jeffrey? What's happening?
The victim is Jeffrey Hines.
He wasn't on our target list.
Does he have a connection to Walsh or Clark?
Well, Garcia can't find one.
Hines and his wife moved to Cleveland from Hawaii last month.
What does his wife say?
Walsh came to the door, said something to her husband,
and then he just opened fire.
Something's off on this one.
Maybe Hines has a past she doesn't know about.
Well, hopefully that's it.
Why hopefully?
Because if there's truly no connection here,
Walsh is devolving.
He's killing random people.
I know he put his life on the line for his country.
I admire and I respect him for that.
Unsung heroes.
A lot of good men come back from combat damaged.
They deserve another chance.
Another chance.
Mr. Rossi, when I was 12 years old,
my father told me he was never going to drink again.
For the umpteenth time.
And I believed him.
I was a kid.
Then one day he takes me and 3 of my friends
to Dodger Stadium.
I can still remember the exact moment
the vendor put that first beer in his hand.
Second inning, Mickey Hatcher at the plate.
One ball, two strikes.
I saw that beer and I knew what was coming.
My father got so drunk,
my friends' parents had to come pick us up and take us home.
Take me home.
I'm really sorry, Thomas.
I could tell you 10 more stories just like that one.
This program my father's in,
hopefully it makes him better,
but my son is not going through
the same humiliation and disappointment that I did.
I don't hate my father, Mr. Rossi.
I don't not care about him.
I love him.
But I've got to protect my family.
That's my priority.
All I ask is that you don't take
the possibility of forgiveness off the table.
Not yet.
Can I get you some more tea, Mr. Rossi?
No, thank you, ma'am.
I--I really should be going.
He's outside, isn't he?
He's in the car.
I wish it were possible, Mr. Rossi,
but it isn't.
I've worked too hard to build a good home
for me and my family.
People can't build without tools.
And tools are passed down to us from others.
When you take in the life you've built, Thomas,
and watch the life your son will build for his own family,
remember that.
I knew I was crazy to hope.
I'm sorry, Harrison.
So I guess that's it, then.
Your son's a fine young man. You should be proud.
I am.
I just wish I could tell him that to his face.
What now?
You tell me.
I could take you back to the motel
And leave you with your Vodka.
Or, if I ignore every speed limit sign
between here and Santa Monica, I could get you back
to new directions just under the wire.
Look, Harrison,
it took a long time to get to this point with your son.
It's not gonna fix itself overnight.
And on the international front,
60 people, mostly women and children,
are believed dead in a suicide bombing.
Enough of that depressing stuff.
It's happy hour, for crying out loud.
Things won't change.
Excuse me?
The world.
There aren't enough bullets to make things right.
You got that thing figured out with your neighbor yet?
Ah, jeez, the doggie-doo wars.
I told you, that kid will never pick up after his mutt
when he goes on my lawn, right?
But yesterday, it really hits me.
I'm going about this all wrong.
It's not the kid's fault,
it's the parents' fault. They never taught him any better.
Did you go talk to them?
I did better than that.
Last night, I scooped up the dog poop,
walked next door, I set it right down
on mom and dad's welcome mat.
Mi caca es su caca.
That's great.
Take the problem to the doorstep.
Go to the source.
This is strange.
The M.E. Reports from the home invasion.
Teddy Walsh's wrists were tightly bound,
but there were no subdermal hematomas
around the deep ligature marks.
What do you see here?
Someone clinging to memories.
It's basically a shrine to his wife.
More importantly, what don't you see here?
His son.
Exactly.
There's not a single photograph
or shred of memorabilia about him.
And the suicide note was addressed only to his wife.
Garcia, you said Teddy Walsh
had gotten into some trouble at school, yes?
Yeah. Nothing serious.
He stole a video game from another kid's locker.
And that's why Walsh took his son on the expanded horizons hike?
Uh-huh, that's right.
And expanded horizons takes people out in groups, yes?
Yes, sir.
Ok, can you find out the names
of the other participants on that specific trek?
Let me see...
Oh. Lordy, lordy.
Howard Clark and father.
Walsh and Clark were on that hike together.
I think we just found Clark's accomplice.
Walsh's own son.
We haven't found the connection with the jogger yet,
but every victim of Walsh's
has been associated with criminal behavior.
Only the guilty deserve to die.
Except today started with Walsh ready to die himself.
He wrote a suicide note.
Because he was guilty, too.
His own son was complicit in the death of his wife.
Garcia.
Talk to me.
Are Howard Clark's parents still in the Cleveland area?
Uh, father died 5 years ago, heart attack.
Mother--yep, Helen Clark. Sending her address now.
You said earlier that Walsh might want to balance the books.
There'd only be one person to provide that kind of payback.
Another parent.
Mrs. Clark.
You know who I am, don't you?
Yes.
Then you know why I'm here.
Am I going to die tonight?
Yes, ma'am.
I'm afraid you are.
Howard Clark's mother won't answer.
The two boys probably hatched the plan
when they met on the hiking trip.
Teddy knew where his mother kept the jewels
and when his father would be gone.
Except Clark shows up high on meth,
tries to rape the mother, Teddy fights back
and Clark kills the both of them.
And that explains the lack of subdermal hematomas
on Teddy's wrists.
He was killed first and then tied up.
Jeffrey Hines, the jogger who got shot,
Garcia found a connection.
It's not who he was, it's where he was.
Your son doesn't look like much of a killer there.
Neither did my son, though.
What are you talking about?
My son Teddy was in on it.
Not the killing part.
But he made it happen.
I got a picture, too.
This is my wife, Emma.
Look at it.
I'm so sorry.
If I'd been a better dad,
and you'd been a better mom...
It's too late for what-ifs.
We can't blame ourselves for what happened that night.
No?
I watched you in the courtroom
when you testified for your son,
defending the murder of my family?
I'm a mother.
No matter what happens in this world,
a child has a right to know there is somebody
who will stand up for them.
Even if they're a cold-blooded killer?
The drugs had taken over my boy.
I know my son.
And what happened that evening, that wasn't who he was.
I thought I knew my son, too.
Emma tried to warn me that he needed help.
Small things...
I didn't listen.
Mrs. Clark,
do you think we're reunited
with loved ones after death?
Yes, I do.
I wish I did.
It's just a way for the living to cope
with loss.
I guess we'll both find out soon enough, won't we?
Are you scared?
I think about fear a lot.
I try to imagine what Emma must have felt
in those final moments.
Clifford Walsh, FBI.
Put the weapon on the table.
No.
Slowly lower it.
Helen hasn't harmed anyone.
She's innocent.
Wrong. I don't hurt the innocent.
Wrong. You already have.
Who? The thugs in the park?
The meth dealers?
The guy that was choking his wife?
You're forgetting about the jogger.
Hines?
Let me tell you about him.
When Hines worked to the D.A.'s office,
Clark's father used his influence
to have evidence suppressed.
Evidence...
that would have sent my wife's killer to jail for life.
The former emplyee at the D.A.'s office
was Morgan Hines.
6 months ago he sold that house to his brother Jeffrey.
That was the man you killed.
No.
That was the place. I checked.
Jeffrey Hines was innocent, Clifford,
and you murdered him.
He left behind a wife and 3 kids.
When I saw the sun come up this morning,
I knew it was gonna be my last time.
Mrs. Clark...
I hope you're right.
How was your night?
All squared away.
And I talked to my boss at work.
He's gonna let me keep my job.
Great.
I sound like a broken record, but...
thanks again for everything.
Just focus on controlling what you can.
The rest of it will fall into place.
Right.
One more thing.
That fortune cookie of mine back at the motel,
what did it say?
Oh, yeah.
Um, "Be careful to avoid
extravagant purchases this month."
Well, I think I can manage that one.
Well, then I'll count the
pistol you gave me as being part of last month.
I'll check in with you when I'm back in Washington.
"Forgiveness does not change the past,
but it does enlarge the future."
