listen to me , man .
i &apos;ve been where you are .
please believe me when i tell you ,
the party you &apos;re going to is nothing but trouble .
jerome ?
does jerome have 30 days sober ?
i don &apos;t think so .
you got to learn to appreciate a quiet night in .
i know it &apos;s hard .
that &apos;s why you &apos;ve got me .
and i &apos;m already home , baby -- headed to bed .
you don &apos;t believe me ?
morning .
morning .
did you read the label ?
i know how to make coffee .
your last pot tasted like motor oil .
that was an anomaly .
how was i supposed to know it was espresso beans ?
by reading the label .
well , obviously , this time i read the label ,
and i just happen to like espresso beans .
mm @-@ hmm . and if it &apos;s too strong for you ...
that &apos;s too bad because i &apos;m gonna drink it
just like it is .
that &apos;s right .
you are . every drop .
rizzoli .
no , you have the wrong number .
yes , i &apos;m sure .
everything okay ?
yeah .
where is maura ? we &apos;re gonna be late .
i &apos;m here .
what are you doing ?
i &apos;ve got some lower back pain ,
so i &apos;m attempting a new relaxation technique .
it looks like lying on the floor and sighing .
well , it &apos;s more sophisticated than that .
well , do you feel relaxed ?
not entirely .
how about now ?
rizzoli .
no , i can &apos;t help you .
because this isn &apos;t an escort service !
yes , i &apos;m sure . i d--
i can &apos;t -- wha--
rizzoli .
oh , really ? with the heavy breathing ?
come on .
and why are you getting an escort at this hour ?
shouldn &apos;t you be at work ?
well , shouldn &apos;t you be looking for work ?
no , i will not help you &quot; work on your résumé . &quot;
gross .
you know , you are a public servant ,
and clearly this guy needs some service .
oh , shut up and drink your sludge .
i don &apos;t know what happened .
a @-@ a telemarketer must have gotten my number , you know ,
and -- and ...
i &apos;m done .
listen to me , you pervert .
i don &apos;t have the time ...
to facilitate some weird fantasy
from some basement @-@ dwelling mouth breather
with too much access to the internet , so you can go f--
isles .
rizzoli .
第六季 第十一集
another wrong number .
that is the fifth call that i &apos;ve gotten like that .
and i block every single one of them .
this is getting ridiculous .
well , perhaps the department could issue you a new number .
i &apos;ve put the request in .
they &apos;re just taking their sweet time about it .
it sounds awful .
one guy asked me to ...
&quot; wax his banister . &quot;
that &apos;s not a thing .
i know .
nobody calls it that .
well , what did you say ?
w--
i can &apos;t , um , say to you ... right now .
what are we talking about ?
euphemisms for the male phallus .
victim is dan walsh , 27 .
according to his landlord , he lived here about two years .
is he a parolee ?
he worked for a nonprofit
that keeps troubled kids off the street .
i guess he lived where he worked .
no witnesses .
struggles and arguments
are pretty much par for the course around here .
security systems ?
padlocks and baseball bats .
definitely no cameras .
maybe it &apos;s just a robbery gone wrong .
left his wallet and cellphone behind .
i think someone just wanted him dead .
which he is .
we know how ?
subdural hemorrhaging around the trachea and larynx .
acute cause of death appears to be asphyxia .
so he was strangled .
i &apos;m inclined to say yes , though the ligature mark
is less distinct than i &apos;d expect .
according to his texts , he died around 9 : 30 last night .
that &apos;s consistent with rigor and lividity .
he has a selfie with his murderer .
yeah , too bad he didn &apos;t have one of those selfie sticks .
to use as a weapon .
and achieve a universally flattering angle .
dan walsh .
dmv records show he moved to boston about two years ago .
originally from los angeles .
he have any family here or anybody we could talk to ?
doesn &apos;t seem to .
he &apos;s just been living at that one address
and working at the center for troubled teens .
maybe one of the kids turned against him .
a co @-@ worker said he was a rock star .
and every kid we talked to
said he &apos;s the reason why they turned their lives around .
he didn &apos;t have an emergency contact in his dmv records ,
and i can &apos;t find a last @-@ known address in california .
according to social security , there &apos;s no work history , either .
oh , so he &apos;s a criminal .
a lot of people at the center
said he was secretive about his past .
okay , so he &apos;s got a troubled past , he goes straight ,
starts working with kids
so they don &apos;t make the same mistake he does .
maybe his past caught up to him .
i buy it .
i would , too ,
except he doesn &apos;t have a record .
prints are clean .
well , that just means he didn &apos;t get caught .
we running him through ncic ?
as we speak .
well , maybe he &apos;s wanted for questioning somewhere ,
or he got a parking ticket in topeka .
anything to help us figure out what his story is .
and why he &apos;s dead .
how &apos;s it coming ?
good . i mean , not for him .
he &apos;s dead .
from ?
ligature @-@ strangulation homicide .
the abrasions appear to be scratches
from the victim &apos;s own fingernails .
ah , he put up a fight .
do we know what he was strangled with ?
the faintness of the markings suggests a soft material ,
like a necktie or a cloth .
and based on the contusions around the adam &apos;s apple ,
it probably had a knot tied in the middle .
makes for a quicker kill .
the hyoid bone was completely crushed .
this killer knew what he was doing .
there &apos;s a reason the fingerprints we ran
didn &apos;t bring us anything on dan walsh --
that ain &apos;t dan walsh .
says who ?
detective from los angeles robbery homicide division just called .
he said , &quot; why are you running dan walsh
through ncic ? &quot;
i said , &quot; well , he &apos;s a homicide victim . &quot;
detective says , &quot; huh . that &apos;s funny , &quot;
because they have a dan walsh on the table in their morgue .
they have the same identity ?
yeah , they were found dead within three days of each other .
well , that can &apos;t be a coincidence .
well , do we know how the l.a. victim died ?
he just said it was a likely homicide .
the body was found in a shallow grave ,
uncovered by some construction workers .
no i.d. , but the fingerprints and the dental records
were definitive .
their guy is dan walsh .
which means our guy ...
just became john doe .
l.a. coroner &apos;s office says dan walsh
looks to have been dead for about two years .
which is the exact time
that our guy has been living in boston
under dan walsh &apos;s identity .
so maybe our john doe killed dan walsh
and then stole his i.d. to start a new life ?
whitey bulger lived under an assumed identity for years .
yeah , but we ran his prints ,
and whoever this guy is , he doesn &apos;t have a record .
still , he could be running from something .
well , all we know for sure
is that in the past at some point ,
our john doe intersected with dan walsh .
yep . or someone with dan walsh &apos;s i.d.
all roads lead to dan walsh .
so if we &apos;re gonna figure out who our john doe is ...
unh @-@ unh . don &apos;t say it .
you are going to l.a.
yes !
no !
come on !
i don &apos;t like to fly , and -- and i get jet @-@ lagged ,
and l.a. is so not my style .
it &apos;s okay . we &apos;ll suck it up just this once .
not you , frankie .
the department will only pay for one detective .
but the homicide unit in l.a. is eager to collaborate .
so is the coroner &apos;s office .
i &apos;ve been on the phone with the l.a. coroner all morning .
initial findings of their victim
suggest ligature @-@ strangulation homicide .
the same as our guy .
the thing is , no autopsy &apos;s been performed ,
and due to the backlog , there isn &apos;t one scheduled .
makes sense -- big city .
so is boston .
yeah , but they don &apos;t have maura -- the backlog killer .
thank you .
the details of the l.a. murder
might inform our analysis of john doe &apos;s murder .
especially if they were killed by the same person .
well , i offered to come to l.a. personally
and facilitate the autopsy , and they agreed .
wait . so they both get to go ?
you &apos;re welcome to go with them if you pay your own way .
fine . i don &apos;t want to go .
i &apos;m gonna stay here and drink espresso ... naked .
i &apos;m gonna take a bath in espresso .
i don &apos;t need that visual , bro .
well , this should be fun .
sox games are fun .
cronuts -- very fun .
there &apos;s not really a word to accurately describe los angeles .
well , maybe we can find one while we &apos;re there .
goody .
欢迎使用自助服务
hi . can i help you ?
uh , yeah .
i &apos;m -- i &apos;m trying to upgrade my rental ,
but this machine thingy won &apos;t let me do it .
let me pull up your reservation .
thank you .
first time using one of these , huh ?
yeah . it &apos;s kind of weird .
it &apos;s like you &apos;re here , but you &apos;re not here .
i wish i was there . i love l.a.
but i &apos;m stuck in boston .
oh , you &apos;re kidding .
roxbury .
that &apos;s where i work !
we &apos;re neighbors !
okay , to upgrade your car ,
insert the credit card you want to use .
okay .
hello !
what , really ? that &apos;s like your third one .
i know . i can &apos;t help myself .
there &apos;s a juice bar on every corner .
that looks delicious . strawberry ?
strawberry mango .
oh , this time of year ?
right ? look at all that vitamin a !
how we doing ?
looks like the problem &apos;s your credit card .
it was declined .
it was ?
did you notify the bank that you &apos;re traveling ?
sometimes that sets off a fraud alert .
no , i guess i didn &apos;t .
yeah , but i don &apos;t want to drive what bpd rented for us .
it looks like a toaster had sex with a clown car .
okay . okay .
well , here .
let &apos;s splurge .
it is l.a. , after all .
anything particular in mind ?
something stylish .
and fast .
tasteful . not too flashy .
yeah , and really fast .
i got something .
hey , vince .
liquor license renewal form -- it &apos;s all filled out .
you just have to sign it .
mm . i &apos;ll do it right now .
so , it looks like the girls made it to l.a.
safe and sound .
which means you and i have a golden opportunity .
for what exactly ?
a double date .
no snooping kids --
you , kiki , me , and ron .
well , that &apos;s a great idea . mm .
i can &apos;t wait to meet ron .
and he can &apos;t wait to meet you guys .
how &apos;s tonight ?
i &apos;ll bring wine .
all right .
8 : 00 @-@ ish ?
deal .
good wine , vince .
of course .
really ?
bud abbott !
you can &apos;t just walk over him .
it &apos;s a sidewalk , not a grave .
why do you get to drive ?
you &apos;re not insured .
really ? you just happen to have one of those things handy ?
i mean , jackie o.
it &apos;s going to be windy .
would you like one ?
no , i would like to drive .
not today .
please start the car .
it &apos;s a turbo .
yeah , it is .
if the discovery of dan walsh &apos;s body
prompted our victim &apos;s murder ,
then at least one other person
knew he was living under an assumed identity .
but why would that person want to kill him ?
did the news of dan walsh &apos;s body being
dug up go national ?
nope . just a few mentions on the local news
and in the l.a. times .
chances are that &apos;s where the killer heard about it .
meaning that whoever did it is from l.a.
or was there at the time walsh &apos;s body was discovered .
that would mean they had to fly here to kill the imposter ,
given our timeline .
well , let &apos;s pull the manifests from flights for l.a. to boston
around the time of john doe &apos;s murder .
okay .
and then check those against the list
of people making return trips after the murder .
gonna be a lot of names .
well , you got to start somewhere .
and we &apos;re still interviewing kids at the youth center ,
but so far ,
our john doe seems like a stand @-@ up guy .
whatever got him killed ...
it was from his past .
oh . detective rizzoli ?
yeah .
oscar acedo .
hey .
welcome to our coast .
thank you .
not in kansas anymore , huh ?
you could say that .
you let me know if i can help you adjust .
i &apos;m l.a. born @-@ and @-@ raised .
okay . how do i adjust to people
who just walk right out in front of cars ?
moving cars ?
&apos;cause we almost killed two yoga moms
and some guy dressed as edward scissorhands
on hollywood boulevard .
car always has to stop , even if they &apos;re jaywalking .
it can get a little crazy .
what do we got here ?
dan walsh -- last seen two years ago
at a homeless shelter in venice .
he was homeless ?
yeah , but he was a regular at the shelter .
i know what you &apos;re thinking .
if a homeless shelter files a missing persons for a transient ,
then surely someone noticed
when your john doe disappeared .
that &apos;s exactly what i &apos;m thinking .
me too .
we &apos;re running a search
for anyone resembling your victim , as well .
oh , this is dr. maura isles .
chief medical examiner of the commonwealth .
we &apos;re lucky to have her expertise .
well , dr. hart has been exceedingly welcoming .
we just returned from the autopsy .
it was thrilling .
was it ?
as we suspected , the victim
suffered a fracture of the laryngeal cartilage .
tell her about the disarticulation of the hyoid horns .
in a strangulation like this ,
the hyoid bone can shift to the side --
which side depends on whether the assailant
was left- or right @-@ handed .
this victim &apos;s pattern of disarticulation
was the same as our victim &apos;s .
so they were killed by the same person .
that &apos;s possible , but it &apos;s also possible that the victims
were killed by two different left @-@ hand dominant people .
of roughly the same height and physical build .
because they were killed by the same person .
i wouldn &apos;t speculate .
there are more of you .
we got something here .
what , a hit on the search ?
yeah , but it &apos;s not missing persons .
obituaries .
from two years ago .
well , it &apos;s a lovely tribute ,
but that guy wasn &apos;t dead when they wrote it .
that &apos;s our john doe .
so , you got a hit .
yes .
our john doe &apos;s name is roger parsons .
dan walsh was last seen in los angeles
june 15 , 2013 .
roger parsons supposedly committed suicide
around that same time .
obviously no body was recovered .
because he wasn &apos;t dead .
it was a stunt .
he faked his own death , started over .
well , that how it looks .
do we know his connection with walsh ?
so far , there isn &apos;t one .
they didn &apos;t seem to know each other .
so , how did roger become dan ?
and what made him fake his suicide in the first place ?
i don &apos;t know .
well , i flew you to l.a. to find out .
oh , it wasn &apos;t for the breakfast burritos ?
&apos;cause so far , that &apos;s all i like about this place .
no offense .
burritos for breakfast ?
this is so unfair .
i keep hearing this phrase -- &quot; no worries . &quot;
what &apos;s wrong with it ?
well , i can &apos;t pin down the meaning .
is it a social pleasantry , like &quot; you &apos;re welcome &quot; ?
maybe it &apos;s more like a blanket position , you know ?
like &quot; no nukes . &quot;
i &apos;ll tell you what i can &apos;t do .
i cannot live in a state
where the flip @-@ flop is the state shoe .
and what &apos;s with the drumming everywhere ?
all i hear is drumming .
well , probably because of the drum circles .
uh , kelly parsons ?
i &apos;m detective jane rizzoli .
this is dr. maura isles .
she &apos;s gonna be helping us with your brother &apos;s case .
i &apos;m so sorry for your loss .
thank you .
you know , i stood right here two years ago ,
convinced he &apos;d jumped .
all this time , he wasn &apos;t dead .
i &apos;m sorry . this -- this must be such a shock .
we had a funeral for him and everything .
who fakes their death ?
that &apos;s crazy , right ?
i mean , even in roger &apos;s world .
what do you mean , &quot; in roger &apos;s world &quot; ?
fast life .
the hollywood scene , you know ?
then his girlfriend o.d. &apos; ed ,
and suicide made sense ...
even if they never found a body .
do you think maybe there was a part of this fast life
that made him fake his death ?
well , he was obviously in too deep at the hotel ,
so maybe he thought it was the only way out .
what hotel ?
where he worked .
for a guy named alphonse .
we don &apos;t have any record of him at a hotel .
it wasn &apos;t that kind of job .
okay , primer . what do you want us to know ?
yeah , all i know is cardiologist , patriots fan ,
daughter joann .
and i &apos;m not telling you anything .
i want your unbiased opinion .
what , from him ?
would you pour ?
oh , there he is !
ron hanson .
vince korsak .
‭ how you doing ?
oh , they &apos;re beautiful . thank you .
you &apos;re welcome .
so , come in and have a drink !
hello .
i &apos;ve heard a lot about you .
likewise .
you two know each other ?
what ?
nope .
the fact that you don &apos;t know each other is my fault .
i mean , this dinner is long overdue .
wine ?
wine .
declined ?
you &apos;re sure ?
yeah .
i &apos;m happy to spot you .
yeah , maura , that &apos;s not the point .
this is my last card .
i don &apos;t think this is a glitch .
i think somebody &apos;s got my information .
the fire .
maybe your mail was compromised
when the building was evacuated .
yeah , maybe .
it would explain all the weird phone calls .
you know what ?
nina &apos;s still at the office
going through the flight manifests .
i &apos;ll see if she can check it out .
good idea .
i mean , whoever is doing this has access to my entire life ,
and i can &apos;t even buy myself a drink ,
which is very overpriced .
and , if i may , a little heavy on the vermouth .
yeah , i &apos;m not really a bartender .
i &apos;m an actor .
i just do this so i can audition during the day .
this will cover you .
not in this place .
ask him . that &apos;s not gonna cover me here .
no .
well , make it work .
i &apos;m supposed to be a high roller .
don &apos;t blow my cover .
ooh , mr. franklin .
good luck . wait
no , no , no .
i need you for this part .
oh , no .
i &apos;d rather call it a night .
and i don &apos;t want my martini .
you don &apos;t have to have one .
pull up a science journal on your phone .
okay . i can do that .
i &apos;ve got a critical study on hanging cases
i &apos;ve been dying to read .
fascinating . put these on .
at night ?
yes .
put those on , don &apos;t look up ,
and don &apos;t talk to anyone , no matter what happens .
psst .
want to be an actor ?
she &apos;s very important .
i can do an english accent ,
and i can do a southern dialect ,
and -- and , um , i can juggle .
yeah , oh , good for you .
quickly , could you tell me where i would find alphonse ?
oh , you can &apos;t miss him .
there ?
thank you .
well , whatever you need , it &apos;s on me .
alphonse .
darling .
hey .
hi .
hello .
how are you ?
good , good . how are you ?
i &apos;m good .
good .
it &apos;s good to see you .
last time i was in here , i had marty with me .
we barely got a chance to talk .
yes . yeah .
remember ?
oh , of course i do .
i &apos;m so sorry .
you know what he &apos;s like before he has a movie that comes out .
yes .
listen , i was wondering if you could help me .
um , marty &apos;s gonna be in here tomorrow night ,
but this time , he &apos;s bringing her .
and she is ?
still in rehab , according to the papers .
but you and i both know if we don &apos;t get her
a bottle of vodka and an eight ball
we &apos;re both gonna lose our jobs , so ...
the last time , i had roger help me with this ,
but i @-@ i can &apos;t find him anywhere , so ...
could you help me ?
please . please . please , please .
of course i can .
whatever you need .
oh ! thank you !
oh , you &apos;re welcome .
thank you , thank you , thank you .
i was so hoping you would say that .
this is ridiculous .
you tricked me .
yeah , well , i didn &apos;t think you &apos;d talk to me
about a missing person who technically never worked here .
you were right .
but we know he did .
and we know that you buy off @-@ book things
for people who are willing to pay ,
so what was roger &apos;s role ?
she just won a grammy .
focus , alphonse .
i have a few runners who pick things up for guests --
women , pills , whatever they want , okay ?
roger ran the drugs .
who &apos;s your dealer ?
he &apos;s not my dealer , first of all .
okay , one phone call , and this entire place gets raided .
you want to lose your liquor license tonight ?
because that pop princess over there
looks like she &apos;s about 12 .
dealer &apos;s name is lamar .
is lamar the kind of guy
you &apos;d fake your death to get away from ?
i don &apos;t know .
i have these runners so i can stay out of it .
you got to do better than that .
roger really lost it after his girlfriend o.d. &apos; ed ,
so maybe he said the wrong thing to lamar ...
or tried to get out of the game ,
but we both know that &apos;s not how it works .
how do i find lamar ?
he &apos;s probably on speed dial of half the phones in this room .
it was awful , vince .
i never sat through such an awkward dinner .
yeah , ron and kiki were avoiding each other all night .
like exes .
no .
look , i &apos;m no detective ,
but i know when two people have history .
it would explain a lot .
oh , it explains everything .
that &apos;s why they didn &apos;t say anything .
they didn &apos;t want it to be weird that the person i &apos;m with
and the person you &apos;re with used to be ...
with each other .
then again ...
yeah , could be anything . no way to know .
well , that &apos;s why we have to ask them .
we do ?
don &apos;t we ?
lamar st. john , 28 -- drug dealer to the stars .
so he makes a good living .
and he &apos;s well @-@ connected , political .
he &apos;s untouchable , and he knows it .
is that why he so readily agreed to come talk to us ?
nothing sticks to this guy .
we &apos;ll see about that .
how you been , lamar ?
i can &apos;t complain , though i can &apos;t stay long .
i &apos;m opening up a new hookah bar in westwood .
the traffic will get you .
don &apos;t i know it .
the 405 &apos;s a killer , even in a bentley .
hello .
new recruit ?
this is detective rizzoli , boston homicide .
she wanted to talk to you about roger parsons .
i barely knew him .
you probably sold his girlfriend the drugs that killed her .
oh , yeah ?
she tell you that from beyond the grave ?
roger was a mess after she died .
maybe you thought he was a liability .
so , what ?
you think i pushed him off that pier ?
no .
but i do think you &apos;re the type of person
who doesn &apos;t leave loose ends .
roger didn &apos;t die that day .
but he is dead now .
how &apos;d you guess ?
and you &apos;re a boston cop ...
which means the murder happened there .
oh , come on , mama .
do i look like i got time to chase down some fool in boston ?
and if roger faked his own death just to get me off his back ,
it worked .
i haven &apos;t thought about that fool in two years .
and as long as he stays dead , i ain &apos;t got no issue with him .
now , if you &apos;ll excuse me ,
i really do have to get ahead of traffic .
i hate l.a. drug dealers more than i hate boston drug dealers .
he &apos;s got a point , though .
yeah , if this isn &apos;t about some old grudge catching up to roger ,
then we &apos;re not gonna solve it without connecting him to dan walsh .
which we haven &apos;t done yet .
we will .
hey , nina . what &apos;s up ?
it &apos;s not good news .
your credit cards are just the tip of the iceberg .
you &apos;ve been hacked .
well , did they clean me out ?
no , which is the weird part .
your accounts haven &apos;t been overdrawn .
they were simply canceled .
same with your bank account .
canceled ?
doesn &apos;t somebody have to do that personally ?
someone with a way to verify identity
and answer your security questions .
this hacker is in deep .
o @-@ okay , so , what do i do ?
i &apos;m sending you some documents to sign
in order to open up an official investigation .
and i &apos;m working with the banks to trace the i.p. address
of whoever accessed your accounts
since your apartment fire .
don &apos;t worry , janie .
this is a high priority over here .
we &apos;re gonna find out who &apos;s behind it and shut it down .
okay , thanks , guys .
everything okay ?
yeah , it &apos;s all good .
so , parsons did fake his death to escape his troubled life .
yes . which worked .
if walsh &apos;s body hadn &apos;t have turned up ,
parsons would probably still be alive .
right . so parsons was killed
because somebody knew that he was living as walsh .
and didn &apos;t want us to find out about it .
we &apos;re back to trying to find the connection between these guys .
which brings me to the flight manifests .
right .
we &apos;re looking at a passenger named dustin shaw .
he flew from l.a. to boston and back
within one day of roger &apos;s death ,
and the address he states on his i.d.
is a post office box in venice , california .
maybe the p.o. box means he was homeless like walsh .
there &apos;s something else you need to know about dustin shaw .
he &apos;s dead .
nine months ago .
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy ,
according to the coroner &apos;s report .
so we &apos;ve got another homeless man who &apos;s dead
whose identity has been stolen .
somebody killing homeless people ?
selling their identities ?
cardiomyopathy is a genetic condition ,
so technically , he died of natural causes .
well , technically , parsons died of suicide .
we have to find the guy living as dustin shaw . yeah .
we need to know what he looks like
before we can put a bolo out on him .
i &apos;m working with tsa to get airport security footage .
okay , thanks . in the meantime , we &apos;ll go to venice .
hey . have you seen these two ?
excuse me .

have you seen either one of these guys ?
okay , thanks .

excuse me .
do you recognize these two ?
have you seen either one of these gentlemen ?
one of these two ?
okay , thanks .
$ 1 a piece .
do you recognize these two ?
should i ?
well , they were regulars
at the boardwalk shelter down the block .
well , if that &apos;s true , then they were probably also regulars
at the sand dollar .
is that a bar ?
yeah , all the bums go there .
the bartender cashes social security checks .
he &apos;ll even let you take a shower there sometimes .
all right , thanks .
here .
on the house .
a souvenir of your trip .
it &apos;s that obvious i &apos;m not from here , huh ?
most people aren &apos;t from here .
even me .
but i can &apos;t leave .
i mean , who wouldn &apos;t want to call this home , huh ?
i don &apos;t know that this place could ever feel like home to me .
spoken like a woman who has family she actually likes .
try to let it grow on you .
we aren &apos;t all weirdos here .
thank you .
i @-@ i don &apos;t know about him ,
but i do recognize this guy .
he a customer ?
no .
there was another guy who came in last week or so
asking about him .
he said to call if he came by .
you get a name ?
uh , i think he left his card .
how many years you say you &apos;ve worked here ?
uh , two or three years .
not exactly the american dream .
these guys have nowhere else to go .
i try to help them out .
is that what they call it -- helping them out ?
this is it .
okay , great . thanks a lot .
how do you want to do this ?
you want to question him together ?
no , no , no . it &apos;s your turf .
you take the first crack .
you sure ?
yeah .
i mean , i &apos;ll file for extradition
as soon as i get home , but if he did both murders ,
he &apos;s going down on both coasts .
hey , nina , what do you got ?
homeland security footage just came in
of the man traveling as dustin shaw .
no facial recognition yet ,
but i just wanted you to see who you &apos;re looking for .
okay , thanks . let me know when you get a name .
we &apos;re in the wrong place . the bartender is dustin shaw .
code 3 at 690 north venice boulevard .
hands up . everybody .
come on . get up .
dustin shaw .
l.a.p.d. come out with your hands up .
he &apos;s shredding the evidence .
well , he &apos;s trying to .
it &apos;s still on .
he was just here .
move , move .
move , move !
move , move , move !
l.a.p.d. move !
you okay ? don &apos;t move .
both hands behind your back .
uh ...
nice work .
thanks . is this a problem ?
no .
happens all the time .
on your knees . let &apos;s go .
really ?
oh , yeah . our department is totally viral .
okay , where i come from , this is a problem .
come on .
okay , wh--
this is a problem !
okay ? hey !
this is -- this is a big pr--
you &apos;re a problem , you &apos;re a --
what are you doing ?
go ! go !
this is a problem !
all these i.d.s are names of regulars in the bar .
yeah , people who probably wouldn &apos;t notice
if somebody opened a credit card in their name .
the guys we talked to said that the bartender ,
a.k.a. dustin shaw , let them use the bar as a mailing address
so they had a place to receive their checks --
disability , social security .
well , i &apos;ll bet he enjoyed cashing them , too .
for a fee .
he skimmed thousands off these guys ,
not to mention the money he made selling their i.d.s.
well , it seems like a good side gig .
you know , walsh must have caught on .
some of the guys we talked to
said they &apos;d had suspicions about the check @-@ cashing ,
but they &apos;re transients , addicts .
they didn &apos;t want to confront him .
yeah , and lose what little they had .
okay , well , what made walsh different ?
his hair .
his hair .
our analysis revealed
a vitamin deficiency in the older growth .
consistent with advanced alcoholism or substance abuse .
but the newer growth closer to the scalp --
the deficiency was not present .
so he got sober .
and he must have realized what shaw was doing
and threatened to expose him ,
and in or around that same time ,
parsons is in dire need of a fresh start ,
so shaw kills walsh , sells his i.d. to parsons ,
and then everything &apos;s back to business as usual .
until they found walsh &apos;s body .
right .
and shaw knew that the body would lead to parsons ,
so he flew to boston and took him out .
you two are like a regular cagney and lacey .
thanks .
thank you .
well ...
what ?
it &apos;s factually inaccurate .
cagney and lacey were both police officers .
dr. isles is a ... medical examiner .
thank you .
it &apos;s been very nice working with you , detective .
you too .
do you ladies think that you &apos;ll be back again soon ?
when malibu freezes over .
malibu received .3 inches of snow in 2007 .
it &apos;s not happening .
okay , so , there &apos;s no point in dancing around the subject .
vince and i asked you to come here
because we wanted to clear the air .
there is something the two of you aren &apos;t telling us .
you &apos;re right . there is .
and in most cases , i &apos;m a big advocate
of confronting things head @-@ on .
good .
but in this particular case --
it &apos;s okay . they deserve to know .
uh , ron and i dated .
in the past .
i knew it .
was it serious ?
it was just one date , and it went ...
badly .
uh , during the date , ron was suddenly struck
with an extremely violent case of , um ...
acute gastroenteritis .
isn &apos;t that ...
diarrhea .
i had diarrhea .
he was , uh , trapped in the bathroom the whole night ,
and i felt it would be rude to leave him there ,
though , in retrospect , with all i heard
i desperately wish i had .
that makes two of us .
you poor bastard .
i &apos;m getting some drinks .
oh , ron . you poor guy .
i &apos;ll join you .
okay , that &apos;s funny .
i am so sorry , angela .
i just didn &apos;t want to embarrass anyone ,
and i didn &apos;t want you to think differently of ron
because of this story .
no , no , it &apos;s okay .
i &apos;m just really glad to know he &apos;s human .
so , the bartender was not dustin shaw .
right .
he was just living as dustin shaw .
his real name was michael something .
so no one is who they say they are .
welcome to los angeles .
oh , come on .
it hasn &apos;t grown on you just a little bit ?
god , no .
i &apos;ve never wanted to see a duck boat so badly in all my life .
well , i find it very relaxing .
my low back pain is completely gone .
coincidence .
no .
you find it so hard to imagine yourself living here ?
hello .
really ?
you want to be attacked by a monkey in a bikini ?
at least he &apos;s not wearing flip @-@ flops .
i think it &apos;s a capuchin .
hey ! welcome home .
and she has returned from the land of sun and sand .
and wine .
indeed .
very serious about their wine , those californians .
thank you .
mm , enjoy .
be glad you didn &apos;t have to go all the way there to get it .
you are not allowed to take a paid vacation to california
and then complain about it .
do you want your souvenir or not ?
is it wine ?
i want it if it &apos;s wine .
mister juicy ?
mm @-@ hmm . if you ever wanted
to feel like you were in l.a. , look no further .
now cleanse .
cleanse what ?
just ... cleanse .
jane .
there &apos;s something you need to see .
i traced the origin of the hack to your accounts
to a specific ip address .
it took me and three encryption experts
from the bank to do it .
when i zeroed in on the address ,
it triped some machanism that redirected me
to an unindexed website
that you can &apos;t access without a password .
can we crack it ?
the password is jane rizzoli .
the web address contained a compressed video file
which i downloaded .
it &apos;s my apartment .
from before the fire .
wait a minute . what is this ?
it wasn &apos;t an accident .
why send a video ?
&apos;cause whoever set the fire ...
wants me to know about it .
