it &apos;s so weird . how did joey end up kissing charlie last night ?
i thought you &apos;d end up kissing charlie .
i thought i &apos;d end up kissing charlie too .
but surprise !
i missed most of the party .
charlie &apos;s a girl , right ?
yeah , she &apos;s this new professor in my department that i did not kiss .
i don &apos;t know why joey had to kiss her . of all the girls at the party , god !
why do you care so much ?
yes , rachel . why do you care so much ?
because ross is the father of my child .
you know , and i want him to hook up with lots of women .
all i &apos;m saying is , i don &apos;t think that joey and charlie have anything in common .
i don &apos;t know . they seemed to have a shared interest in each other &apos;s tonsils .
wow . joey and a professor . can you imagine if they had kids ?
and if the kids got her intelligence ..
and joey &apos;s raw sexual magnetism ..
those nerds would get laid !
all right . so , ross , you &apos;re okay with all this ? i mean ..
it &apos;s no big deal . i just met her . i &apos;m fine with it .
god , i forgot how hot she was .
i &apos;m gonna get some more coffee .
oh , you know , i &apos;ll come with you .
okay .
so a professor , huh ?
yeah . she is cool . and she &apos;s so smart .
her mind is totally acrimonious .
guess that &apos;s not how she used it .
i feel like i owe you an explanation .
i don &apos;t ordinarily go around kissing guys at parties .
i &apos;m ..
well , i &apos;m kind of embarrassed . i really hope you don &apos;t think less of me .
think less of you ? no . i don &apos;t think less of you .
i mean , you saw someone you liked and you kissed them .
those people who like someone and don &apos;t kiss them ..
those people are stupid . i hate those people .
actually , i &apos;m a little surprised at myself .
i mean , joey &apos;s so different from the guys i usually date .
they &apos;re all professors , intellectuals . paleontologists mostly .
you know , very cerebral ..
yeah , i know the type .
if we want to grab a bite before work , we &apos;d better get acrimonious .
no ? am i getting close ?
the.one.with.the.fertility.test
hey !
hi .
hey , you guys . look what i just got .
oh , wow ! i love those ! where did you get them ?
i bought them off ebay . they used to belong to the late shania twain .
phoebe , shania twain is still alive .
oh , then i overpaid .
hey , what &apos;s this ?
oh , it &apos;s a gift certificate to this new spa in soho .
you can &apos;t show phoebe this . she hates those corporate massage chains .
what , now i can &apos;t get a massage ?
there are so many things that she disapproves of .
i can &apos;t eat veal . i can &apos;t wear fur .
i can &apos;t go hunting .
do you want to go hunting ?
i would like to have the option .
what &apos;s that ? hey , rachel ?
no , you can &apos;t go there !
you know how i feel about these big massage places .
they &apos;re putting people like me out of business .
she wants to go hunting too !
phoebe , come on , i don &apos;t want to waste it .
it would be like throwing away 100 bucks .
okay , this is not about the money . okay ?
it &apos;s about corporate greed destroying our hearts ..
and leaving us hollow shells .
i don &apos;t care about any of that .
well , do you care about friendship ? i feel really strongly about this .
please don &apos;t use this gift certificate . i &apos;m asking you as a friend .
oh , not as a friend . phoebe !
fine . i won &apos;t use it .
promise ?
i promise .
thank you .
well , i am going hunting .
hey , honey . i missed you today .
oh , yeah ?
yeah . hey .
what do you wanna do tonight ?
oh , well , maybe we could ..
okay , trying to turn me on by making a mess ?
know your audience .
besides , tomorrow we &apos;re doing those fertility tests .
until then , you need to keep your tadpoles in the tank .
do we really need to take those tests ?
i don &apos;t like the words they use , you know ?
they &apos;re so clinical . this is a pee @-@ pee , that &apos;s a hoo @-@ hoo .
we &apos;ve been trying to have a baby for a year .
i think it &apos;s a good idea to find out if everything &apos;s okay .
just a few routine tests .
but i don &apos;t want to do it in a cup .
what is the big deal ?
it &apos;s weird ! you &apos;re in a doctor &apos;s office .
it &apos;s not okay to do it in a doctor &apos;s office ..
but it is okay to do it in a parked car behind a taco bell ?
i cannot believe ross told you that .
and in my defense , it was a wendy &apos;s .
look , i don &apos;t want to do these tests either .
but i really do think it &apos;s a good idea .
i &apos;m sure a doctor &apos;s office can &apos;t be worse ..
than on a class trip to the hershey factory .
oh , yeah ! rachel talks too !
who says wine has to cost more than milk ?
hey !
hi .
come on in . how are you ?
i &apos;m good .
can i offer you a drink ?
please .
i have been crazed all day .
i had a meeting with the dean , my syllabus for summer school &apos;s due ..
and i &apos;m writing the foreword for a book .
i had a pretty hectic day at work too . today i had to open a door and go :
so i am just so excited to be here .
i can &apos;t wait to explore the city .
if you need a tour guide ..
oh , you mean it ? that would be so fun .
oh , yeah , definitely . definitely . okay . what do you want to see first ?
we could go see the kronos quartet at avery fisher hall .
okay .
there &apos;s a collection of walt whitman letters on display at the public library .
i know .
but first , i have to see the met .
okay , let me stop you right there .
the mets suck , okay ?
you wanna see the yankees .
no . no , not the mets . the met . singular .
which one ? they all suck .
the museum .
i don &apos;t think so .
hi there .
hello . welcome to lavender day spa .
how may i help you ?
hi . i have a massage appointment under rachel greene .
okay .
and here is my gift certificate .
this has been torn up .
and taped back together .
okay . well , i &apos;ll call you as soon as your massage therapist is ready .
okay .
have a seat through the glass doors .
through the glass doors .
through the glass doors .
all righty then .
phoebe , your next client &apos;s in the waiting room .
do we have to talk like that when they &apos;re not around ?
oh , no . no , no .
listen , is there someone who can fill in for me ?
sorry . everyone is booked .
that woman can &apos;t know i work here .
she &apos;s a friend of mine and i made this big stink ..
about how awful these massage chains are .
then why do you work here ?
because it &apos;s good money .
but that doesn &apos;t change the fact ..
that this is an evil , bloodsucking corporate machine .
well , i think this is a great place to work .
okay , are they listening ?
ross . hey .
hi .
i need to talk to you about charlie .
oh , do you ? do you really ?
yeah , i &apos;m kind of having a little problem .
look , if you don &apos;t know what the word &quot; acrimonious &quot; means , just don &apos;t use it .
look , you know charlie , right ?
she &apos;s cool , funny , her body is so ..
get to the problem .
right . she &apos;s just so much smarter than all the girls i &apos;ve ever dated .
combined .
you know ? and i just .. i don &apos;t want her to think i &apos;m stupid .
are you wearing two belts ?
hey , what do you know ?
you were saying you didn &apos;t want to seem stupid .
well , she wants to go to all these cultural places ..
and i don &apos;t know how to talk about that stuff . you gotta help me out .
i don &apos;t want to get involved in your guys &apos; relationship .
oh , dude , please . come on , you &apos;re the smartest person i know .
and i really like this girl , okay ? i don &apos;t want to lose her .
fine .
thanks .
okay . let &apos;s see .
oh , you should take her to the met .
the mets .
no , no , no . the met . the metropolitan museum of art .
oh , that &apos;s what she meant .
if they &apos;re gonna shorten it , they should call it the &quot; muse , &quot; you know ?
short for &quot; museum &quot; and avoid all the confusion .
yeah , most days the place is packed with confused , angry baseball fans .
okay . all right , so i &apos;ll take her to the met .
yeah . okay . there &apos;s this great rare bookstore on madison avenue .
you know what ? she loves architecture .
you should take a walk down fifth to the st. patrick &apos;s cathedral .
and there , there &apos;s this great little pastry shop that she &apos;d love .
jeez . sounds like you should be going on this date .
but i &apos;m not .
and you know what .. ?
okay , slow down .
you &apos;re going way too fast . okay ? just go back to the met .
so you gotta tell me exactly what to do there .
when you walk into the museum , take a right , okay ?
that &apos;s the antiquities wing .
ancient egypt , mesopotamia , up to the byzantine empire .
okay . so i walk in the door and make a right .
i have a weird feeling about this place . how do i know ..
they won &apos;t secretly videotape me and put it all over the lnternet ?
because , honey , and i mean this in the sweetest way possible ..
nobody &apos;s gonna wanna watch that .
mr. bing ? here you are .
go into that room and deposit your specimen into the container .
deposit my specimen ?
i usually have to call a 900 number for that kind of talk .
thanks . got it .
all right . honey , my tests are down the hall .
are you sure you &apos;re gonna be okay ?
yeah , i guess .
look , i know this is embarrassing , but nobody cares .
no one here even knows you .
oh , my god !
oh , come on !
how great is this ?
we &apos;re probably fertile . let &apos;s go home .
why are you here ?
sid and i are trying again and we had trouble last time ..
no , no , no . i mean , why ? why is she here ?
oh , someone &apos;s a little cranky today because they have to do it in a cup .
oh , they gave you the kiddie size .
what ?
this was fun . but i &apos;ve got an invasive vaginal exam to get to .
i &apos;d love to stay but i &apos;ve got a hot date .
please go . just let me know if you need a hand .
i think it just fell off .
hello , ja .
it &apos;s time for your massage , ja ?
put your face in the hole .
a swedish massage from a real swedish person .
okay , then i &apos;m swedish .
so , what &apos;s your name ?
it &apos;s a normal swedish name .
ikea .
wow . what an interesting name .
yeah .
you know , i ..
time for your scalp massage .
wow . i really love your ..
is something wrong ?
no , it &apos;s just ..
it just feels so good ..
ikea .
hey , say , you &apos;ll know this . what &apos;s the capital of sweden ?
stockholm .
damn . i wish i knew if that was right .
note the painterly lines and subtle impasto on this canvas .
monet painted quickly , and usually outdoors ..
as his elusive subject was light itself .
now , do you have any idea what you just said ?
no , no . my mouth says the words , my brain is thinking &quot; monster trucks . &quot;
now , remember , when you get to the museum ..
monet is not spelled m @-@ o @-@ n @-@ a @-@ y. i just ..
i wrote that out phonetically for you .
phonetically ?
yeah , that means .. we just don &apos;t have time for this .
i gotta say , i &apos;m really impressed you were able to memorize all this so quickly .
i &apos;m an actor . i can memorize anything .
last week on days , i had to say :
&quot; frontal temporal zygomatic craniotomy . &quot;
wow . what does that mean ?
no idea .
but the guy i said it to dies in the next scene ..
so i guess it means , &quot; you &apos;ll get eaten by a bear . &quot;
okay .
so let &apos;s move on to the renaissance .
okay .
caravaggio uses chiaroscuro here ..
to highlight the anguish of the central figure .
touch it . it &apos;s really bumpy .
no , no , no . no ad @-@ libbing . and , dude , you can &apos;t touch the paintings .
come on .
no . no !
my specimen &apos;s in the room .
i just want to thank whoever knocked on the door while i was in there .
really helped speed the process along .
janice , you &apos;re not gone ?
sid is still in his room .
i don &apos;t allow porn at home , so this is like a vacation for him .
so did you do it ? did you make your deposit ?
yeah . the hard part &apos;s over .
that &apos;s not the hard part , honey .
no , there &apos;s talking to you , but monica &apos;s coming out .
and we &apos;re gonna go soon .
chandler .
the hard part &apos;s what comes next . aren &apos;t you worried about the results ?
i mean , oh , when sid and i did this last time , my god , i was a mess .
i haven &apos;t even thought about the results .
i just assumed everything would be okay .
well , you know what ? it probably is .
but what if it &apos;s not okay ?
i mean , what if there &apos;s a reason we can &apos;t have a baby ?
chandler . look , you and monica are meant to have children .
i &apos;m sure it &apos;s gonna be just fine .
yeah . yeah . okay . thanks . i can &apos;t believe i didn &apos;t even think of that .
i guess i was so worried about having to come here and do that .
you can do it in a taco bell parking lot ..
but you can &apos;t do it at a doctor &apos;s office ?
it was a wendy &apos;s !
and that &apos;s the swedish national anthem . thank you for asking .
wow , ikea .
what a rich culture .
you know what ? i have a friend who &apos;s a masseuse .
oh ? ja , ja ?
ja . she &apos;s not very good , though .
and why do you think that is ?
i don &apos;t know .
maybe it &apos;s because she &apos;s got such callousy fingers ..
from playing crummy guitar .
or maybe she has trouble loosening your knots ..
because you &apos;re such a high @-@ maintenance tight @-@ ass .
phoebe !
you know it &apos;s me ?
well , for like a half an hour !
man , you can lie about sweden !
how can you come here ?
why didn &apos;t you tell me you work here ?
i don &apos;t have to tell you everything !
you do if you &apos;re gonna make me feel guilty for getting a free massage .
tip &apos;s not included .
why did you lie to me about working here ?
because i was ashamed , okay ? i sold out for the cash .
and they give me benefits , like medical and dental and a four @-@ oh @-@ wunk .
but , you know , you pay a price . now i &apos;m this corporate stooge ..
and punching a clock ..
and paying taxes !
phoebe , honey , if you hate it so much ..
you should walk out there right now and quit .
be true to what you believe in .
honey , you have principles , and i so admire that .
i don &apos;t have any .
you know what ? you &apos;re right . i am gonna quit .
it &apos;s time i took my life back .
good for you , phoebe .
if you guys have microphones in there too , i didn &apos;t mean any of that .
i love you .
got you ! die ! die ! die !
respectfully , professor r. geller .
hey .
hi .
hey , how was the met ?
the museum was amazing .
yeah , joey really knows his art , huh ?
not so much , no .
he had clearly memorized all this stuff to say ..
and some of it didn &apos;t even make any sense .
what do you mean ?
well , for one ..
he was talking about paintings that were nowhere around .
wait a minute . when you guys walked into the met , did you go to the right ?
no . no , we went to the left .
oh , joey , joey , joey .
still , it seems like you guys are having a great time together .
yeah . yeah , it &apos;s fun .
what ?
actually , joey &apos;s your friend ..
and you don &apos;t know me that well . it &apos;d be weird .
well , i mean , a little . but no , what ? go on .
well ..
i &apos;m thinking that maybe joey isn &apos;t the right guy for me right now .
you know , maybe i should be with someone ..
i have more in common with . you know what i mean ?
yeah .
yeah , but you know what ?
i think you should give joey a chance .
i mean , he &apos;s a great guy .
and sure , he doesn &apos;t know that much about art ..
but you can always talk about that with someone else .
i guess that &apos;s true .
if you think about it ..
he memorized all that stuff because he thought it was important to you .
you know , that &apos;s the kind of guy joey is .
he is very sweet .
plus , he is hot !
that was gonna be my next argument .
you ready ?
yeah . let &apos;s go .
wow !
thanks , ross .
yeah .
hey , ross . that art stuff worked . you hooked me up .
glad i could help , man .
some of the stuff wasn &apos;t where you said it would be , but i made it work .
it is not okay that i &apos;m aroused by this now .
hello ?
oh . hi , dr. connelly .
no . well , she &apos;s not here ..
but i can tell her .
should i be sitting down for this ?
well , so , what does that mean ?
okay . okay , thank you .
thanks .
hey , sweetie .
dr. connelly just called .
with good news ? of course it &apos;s not good news .
you said , &quot; dr. connelly just called . &quot;
if it was good , you &apos;d have said , &quot; dr. connelly just called ! &quot;
so , what is it ? is it .. ?
is there a problem ? is there a problem with me , or with you ?
actually , it &apos;s both of us .
what ?
apparently , my sperm have low motility ..
and you have an inhospitable environment .
well , what does that mean ?
it means that my guys won &apos;t get off their barcaloungers ..
and you have a uterus that is prepared to kill the ones that do .
it means ..
wait , chandler .
it means that we can keep trying ..
but there &apos;s a good chance this may never happen for us .
oh , my god .
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m sorry too .
well ..
we &apos;re gonna figure this out .
i know .
good morning , phoebe .
good morning , receptionist .
here &apos;s your schedule for the day . your first client is in room 1 .
&quot; rachel greene . &quot; son of a bitch ! she came back ?
are you ready for your scottish massage ?
