第二十五季第十五集
&quot; lisa wants
&quot; a dot @-@ dot @-@ dot
guinea pig &quot; ?
hey , homer ,
did you know that guinea pigs are self @-@ groomers ?
and when they get excited , they jump straight up .
it &apos;s called &quot; popcorning . &quot;
lisa got to you .
i don &apos;t know how , but she got to you .
emojis .
now she &apos;s gone too far .
lisa , your father and i are very concerned
about all this hinting .
i &apos;ve never had a pet of my very own .
my clock is ticking .
i don &apos;t want to be one of those girls
who waits till she &apos;s 16 to decide if she &apos;s ready ,
and then it &apos;s too late .
well , we &apos;ve talked about it .
and if you really want a guinea pig ,
you &apos;ll have to sign this contract .
&quot; i , lisa simpson , hereby promise
to take full responsibility for this dog , cat , other . &quot;
circle &quot; other . &quot;
&quot; this includes feeding , bathing ,
cleaning of droppings and barfings ,
and when the time comes , burying or flushing . &quot;
boilerplate , boilerplate , boilerplate .
we can skip all this litter box stuff .
&quot; if pet becomes internet superstar ,
all rights revert to father . &quot;
sign here , here ,
initial here , one more over here .
and done .
oh , my god !
i &apos;m getting a guinea pig !
thank you , thank you , thank you ,
thank you , thank you !
the kid @-@ parent contract .
unenforceable , yet you feel
like you didn &apos;t completely cave .
春田镇界
冰毒村 瘾君子的乐土
一经买卖 概不负责
you &apos;re doing the right thing adopting a rescue pig .
you know , most of these guys are rejects
from the big guinea @-@ pig mills in the midwest .
oh , i can &apos;t tell you how many mill pigs
we get in here who have bumblefoot or the slobbers .
you don &apos;t have children , do you ?
this one whistled at me !
ooh , that could be the one .
oh , but that orange guy looks like a pumpkin .
but this fellow is so fuzzy !
well , they all have their charms .
this one &apos;s nibbling a sunflower seed .
look at that hair .
aw , i just want to comb it forever !
have you seen a pinker nose ?
i have now !
lisa , you &apos;ve just got to choose one .
lisa ?
she &apos;s gone , honey . she &apos;s gone .
that one &apos;s fur looks like a tuxedo !
a band @-@ aid on its tail , aw !
albino !
i &apos;m definitely getting this one .
oh , but i forgot about this one .
oh , my god , i never even saw this one !
maybe i should get that sick one .
if i don &apos;t , no one else will .
bart , list your top five , best to worst .
有空房
no , no , no , no ! worst to best .
i just wish the gray one had the brown one &apos;s personality .
okay , dad , give me your phone .
i need to look at the pictures again .
okay , this is the guinea pig
that will make me happy .
she thinks she &apos;s decided .
don &apos;t say a thing .
don &apos;t blow this .
okay , now , you sure you only want just one ?
they tend to do better in pairs .
i could get two ?
farting tweakers rule !
i &apos;ve tried to give pokey a perfect replica
of his natural habitat .
peruvian feather grass ,
an incan sleeping mat ,
and a portrait of marisol espinoza ,
the vice president of peru .
are you sure you didn &apos;t create a perfect habitat for you ?
i wish i could live in there .
well , there &apos;s plenty of room
because pokey &apos;s gone .
where &apos;d he go ?
this looks like a job for ...
fireplace tongs .
no !
oh , my god !
he &apos;s in the walls !
i hear chewing .
no , that &apos;s a much bigger animal .
kettle corn .
the heroin of the farmers &apos; market .
i &apos;ve lost my guinea pig !
pokey !
our boat painting !
i &apos;m sorry , mom .
that &apos;s okay , sweetheart .
your pig thingy didn &apos;t mean it .
it &apos;s just , it felt comforting to know
that while we watched tv ,
there was art going on behind us .
oh , well , i guess we have to go
to an art gallery and buy a new painting .
sure , we could go to a fancy gallery
and spend a bunch of money , or ...
yeah , milhouse played the violin for years
until it turned out the vibrations
were screwing up his bones .
yeah , these seem great .
oh , too bad someone used cello rosin .
oh , my gosh , that &apos;s beautiful !
i &apos;ve never seen a painting with a lighthouse before .
oh , that .
that was on the wall of kirk &apos;s bachelor pad ,
back when we were
separated .
yeah , it &apos;s a great piece .
i didn &apos;t have a mirror ,
so i shaved in the reflection
of the chrome frame .
this could be our new living room painting .
i don &apos;t know .
how about this poster
of a really rocking jukebox ?
you know it &apos;s rocking &apos; cause music notes
are coming out of it .
painting &apos;s only 20 bucks .
oh , please , homie ?
i &apos;ll throw in the tiny violins .
oh , it looks great !
well ...
to me , it looks like ... garbage salad .
but that &apos;s the great thing about art .
everyone can have their own opinion about why it sucks .
i &apos;ve got to get rid of this ugly chrome frame
from kirk &apos;s bachelor pad .
i hate to think of the things this mirror has reflected .
hey , look .
there &apos;s a signature that the frame covered up .
&quot; johan oldenveldt . &quot;
here he is !
&quot; johan oldenveldt , painter .
&quot; lived in amsterdam , paris .
prolific early 20th century naturalist . &quot;
ooh , i think this was painted by someone famous .
maybe it &apos;s valuable .
we should have it appraised .
pfft ! you guys are crazy .
i never even heard of that guy .
it &apos;s not like it was painted
by leonardo da vinci code .
now , here &apos;s what makes art valuable--
one nudity , two holograms ,
three , something terrible happening to jesus .
用冲动惊悚的方式购买艺术品
ah yes , seascape ,
marvelous natural light ,
classic use of gouache .
you &apos;re right .
this is an early @-@ career oldenveldt .
quite valuable .
oh , my god !
i expect it to go somewhere
between 80 to $ 100,000 .
nobody touch it !
bart , stop looking at it !
but i want to see it !
no , you &apos;ll wear it out !
baby , you saw something in this painting , and you were right .
wow , the van houtens owned this for years ,
and never knew how much it was worth .
think how happy they &apos;ll be
when we sell it and split the money with them .
split it ? whoa !
split it with them ?
kirk and luann didn &apos;t know what the painting
was worth when they sold it .
yes , they sold it to us .
so , now it &apos;s our painting .
we can hang it on our wall ,
cut eyeholes in it to spy on people .
or sell it for lots of money
which we keep .
for ourselves ?
this dude gets it .
but the van houtens are our friends .
are they , marge ?
if you think about it ,
aren &apos;t they really just the parents
of a kid who happens to hang out with our kid ?
all our friends are like that .
well , how would you feel if we sold them something
that turned out to be valuable ?
a : happy for their good fortune .
b : proud to know rich people .
and c : grateful for an opportunity
to learn from a mistake .
how about this ?
what if we give the van houtens
25 % of the money ?
then they &apos;ll just be mad
about the 65 % that we &apos;re keeping .
marge , you like kindness , right ?
sure .
so , even if we gave
kirk and luann some of the money ,
the knowledge of what they could have had will eat away at them ,
like piranhas devouring a wounded yeti .
it &apos;s kinder never to tell them .
okay , i see your point .
we should sell the painting , keep all the money ,
and never , ever tell the van houtens .
what &apos;ll it take to buy your silence ?
okay , milhouse ,
the guys in back are shining up your new bike .
and all i have to do is not say anything
about some painting to my mom and dad ?
oh , sweetie , you want your parents to be happy , don &apos;t you ?
i guess .
&quot; i guess &quot; !
you &apos;re funny !
no wonder lisa &apos;s in love with you .
she is ? !
she is ? !
so , if i keep my mouth shut ,
you get me new wheelie sneakers ,
and bart agrees to promote and encourage use
of my new cool nickname , &quot; c.j. &quot;
you got it , ceej .
you found out that painting was worth big bucks ,
and you weren &apos;t gonna tell us ? !
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
hide the treasure !
i &apos;m sorry , mr. s.
i cracked !
we had a deal .
and now we &apos;ve got nothing !
we considered you our friends .
we trusted you !
i let homer use our master bathroom !
then you stab us in the back !
if you knew you sold a valuable painting for nothing ,
how could you live with yourselves ?
we were just trying to be ... kind .
kind ? ! you call it kind to give us nothing ?
we were gonna treat you
to dinner at an upscale chain restaurant
and never explain why , but now forget it !
oh , so that &apos;s how it is !
that &apos;s exactly how it is .
oh , is it ? !
oh , it is !
luann , i hope we &apos;re still on thursday
for collecting used cell phones for the troops .
i don &apos;t think you need any help .
you &apos;re so good at ... collecting .
oh , that was cold , luann !
so cold !
brr !
sarcastic brr !
see what happens when we get greedy ?
honey , there &apos;s something i want to show you .
an atm receipt ?
i don &apos;t know whose this is .
i found it next to the cash machine ,
and i &apos;ve always kept it . look at the balance .
five figures !
with that painting , we could have what these people have
a money cushion .
no more living paycheck to paycheck ,
one lost retainer away from the gutter .
i could write a check with today &apos;s date on it .
that &apos;s the cushion .
tonight &apos;s special report ,
fat cat art experts take advantage
of john and jane yard sale .
so , would you characterize your friend of many years
cheating you out of your painting as no big deal ,
or a devastating betrayal ?
oh , definitely betrayal , kent .
interesting .
so if you see the simpsons walking down your street ,
lock your doors and hide ... your friendship .
great ! now we &apos;re raccoons ,
the masked bandits of the animal world !
don &apos;t worry . no one &apos;s gonna see this stupid show .
the whole town &apos;s turned against us !
ooh , a support rock !
this one &apos;s against us . this one &apos;s for us .
for , for , against , for , against ...
we don &apos;t even get this many christmas cards .
既冲动又提心吊胆地购买艺术品
there they are , the masterpiece thievers !
ah , shut your bone hole !
that painting belongs to the simpsons !
sharing is what makes a community strong !
all sales are final !
keep it !
finders keepers , moron !
you really think we &apos;re still doing the right thing ?
just close your eyes and think of the cushion .
&quot; untitled landscape &quot; by johan oldenveldt ,
from the collection of homer j. and marge b. simpson .
let &apos;s open the bidding at $ 80,000 .
the paddles , marge ! look at the paddles !
stop the auction !
that painting belongs to me !
dawn ?
good to see you again , beef kirky .
who is this woman ?
while you two were separated ,
kirk and used to be friends ...
with banana @-@ fits .
you told me you didn &apos;t see anyone
during our separation .
madam , are you saying this painting belongs to you ?
kirk stole it from me !
but i didn &apos;t know it was valuable
till i saw the story on tv .
what ? ! i bought that painting !
she &apos;s lying !
the auction is on hold
until we can determine the true ownership .
our cushion !
don &apos;t bother coming home , kirk !
see what your greed has done ?
anybody want to give me a ride home ?
going once ?
going twice ?
sold ! to the lonely auctioneer !
thanks for taking me in , man .
i guess i can &apos;t help but feel fully responsible .
oh , luann , i &apos;ll never gaze from my thick eyeglasses
into your thick eyeglasses ever again .
what you need , my friend , is a canadian duff .
beauty , eh ?
so ... why does that chick think she owns the painting ?
oh , dawn and i went on a vacation
to a resort island called isla verde .
i bought the painting in a cafe ,
but that night she ran off with a parasailing instructor .
not your fault , man .
those parasailing guys take whatever they want .
it was never her painting .
that woman will say anything
to keep herself in electric cigarettes .
and i &apos;d go back to that cafe artiste to prove it ,
but nothing &apos;s gonna get me luann back .
okay , all i gotta do is take a quick ferry to isla verde ,
find cafe artiste , and they &apos;ll back up kirk &apos;s story .
that will prove the painting was his-- and now ours .
oh , homer simpson , that painting has torn the town apart ,
destroyed kirk and luann &apos;s marriage ,
and everyone &apos;s very worried about milhouse .
he &apos;s been playing dancing revolution for hours ,
but the tv is off .
but our cushion !
that picture has brought out the worst in everyone !
please ! just let it go !
you &apos;re not gonna let it go , are you ?
i wish i knew how .
this is so exciting !
my first time establishing provenance !
yeah , yeah , yeah . just remember ,
if your mother asks , i took you to a wine tasting .
that &apos;s a terrible thing for a father to do .
that &apos;s why she &apos;ll believe it .
hmm , this quaint artist community
has gotten a little touristy .
excuse me .
we &apos;re trying to find cafe artiste .
ah , yes . top of the hill .
three discos up , four gelatos on the left .
you can &apos;t miss it .
it &apos;s right between the disco and the gelato place .
welcome to cafe artiste !
would you like a glass of strupo ?
it &apos;s a liqueur made of fermented capers ,
the official drink of the island .
mmm ! sounds delicious .
it &apos;s not .
hey , a friend of mine , uh , bought a painting here .
oh , yes , i remember that painting .
and that is the man i sold it to .
and that man sold it to me !
that proves the painting is mine !
and nothing can stop me from selling it
and keeping all the money !
i love art !
art ?
what do you know about art ?
you don &apos;t even know who painted that picture .
yes , we do . it &apos;s a johan oldenveldt .
wrong ! it &apos;s a me !
a what ?
i painted it !
me , klaus ziegler !
who ?
this is where i painted your so @-@ called oldenveldt .
prove it .
aw , crap !
you &apos;re a forger ?
&quot; forger &quot; is such a cruel word .
i &apos;m an art forger .
your painting was an early , clumsy effort
which i gave to the cafe owner to pay off my strupo tab .
then why did the auction house say it was real ?
i have fooled galleries around the world
with my loving imitations .
ziegler ! ziegler ! ziegler !
ziegler ! ziegler ! ziegler !
what you do is horrible ...
ripping off geniuses who spent years
perfecting their styles .
perhaps you are the one who is horrible .
what ? !
you only cared about that
painting when you thought
it was created by someone famous .
well , no , but now when i look at it , all i see is a fraud .
beauty is beauty .
my forgeries give pleasure to people all over the world .
the only real question to ask about art ,
whether it &apos;s in the louvre
or on a freshman &apos;s wall at cal state fullerton
is , &quot; did it move you ? &quot;
but , you still , i mean ...
oh , i suppose you &apos;re right .
what if i never liked the painting
and only wanted it for money ?
then you , i respect .
oh , great . the painting is worthless ,
this was all for nothing ,
and when marge finds out , she &apos;s gonna kill me .
well , on that front , perhaps i can be of assistance .
if there &apos;s one thing art is good for ,
it &apos;s to melt the frost which often hardens a woman &apos;s heart .
while you &apos;re at it ...
could you make me a couple more ?
i &apos;ll pay you in strupo .
perfect .
oh , now that &apos;s art .
rocking .
