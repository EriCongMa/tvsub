byron always got like that when he couldn &apos;t crack a hustle .
relaxing always helps .
sorry , june .
i &apos;m not really in the mood to relax .
not even if you have a very lovely visitor ?
alex .
got your message .
i &apos;m here .
what do you want , neal ?
i want the music box .
i think you have a memory problem ...
because i said that as long as you &apos;re a fed ,
i &apos;m not telling you where it is .
you &apos;re still with them , right ?
then there &apos;s nothing to talk about .
i &apos;ll make it worth your while .
you need me to get it .
no , i don &apos;t .
then why don &apos;t you have it already ?
i &apos;ll steal it and give it to you .
just like that ?
just like that .
i don &apos;t believe you . you &apos;ll just hand it over ?
yeah ...
when i &apos;m done with it .
knew there was a catch .
what &apos;s this really about ?
you get the box in the end . that &apos;s my offer .
okay .
if you can figure out how to get the anklet off .
i &apos;m not wearing this as a fashion accessory .
well , when the time comes ,
i need to know that you can get off your leash .
otherwise , you &apos;re a liability .
i &apos;ll come back tomorrow at 6 : 00 .
lose the blinking jewelry ,
and you &apos;ll get what you need .
you were supposed to be here 20 minutes ago .
where you been ?
late start to the morning .
won &apos;t happen again .
thank you .
who &apos;s that ?
kimberly rice .
rising star in the bureau .
you &apos;re not a fan .
nope . she works in kidnapping and missing persons .
what &apos;s she doing in white collar ?
she &apos;s here to see you .
whatever i did , i have proof i didn &apos;t do it .
here we go .
we just got the finger point .
the double finger point .
must be serious .
yeah .
rice .
burke .
and you must be the neal caffrey .
agent kimberly rice .
i &apos;ve just heard wonderful things about you .
let &apos;s get straight to it .
we &apos;ve got a ransom situation .
name &apos;s lindsey gless .
she was grabbed last night in a home invasion .
she &apos;s the daughter of stuart gless .
as in the ceo of atlantic partners ,
the company whose bonds you were convicted of forging .
what &apos;s this kidnapping got to do with me ?
you have a history with our prime suspect .
ryan wilkes .
you know him ?
neal .
yeah , yeah .
he runs his own little crime syndicate .
they work everything from grand @-@ theft auto to extortion .
and you used to run with him .
that &apos;s a rumor .
neal .
we may have tried working together once ,
but our styles didn &apos;t mesh .
what makes you think wilkes took the girl ?
chatter from our c.i.s puts wilkes in town .
we also found traces of plasticine clay
in a lock at the crime scene .
someone made a copy of the key .
yeah , it &apos;s wilkes &apos; m.o.
and that &apos;s why we need neal .
neal .
stuart gless likes to eat lunch
at ristorante laurienzo every thursday .
at least , he used to .
there &apos;s only one valet there .
makes it easy to get your hands on his keys .
if wilkes wanted to get into his house ,
he &apos;d probably start there .
i &apos;d check the security tapes .
that &apos;s good . that &apos;s good .
i &apos;d like to borrow caffrey for the remainder of my case .
if wilkes is behind this , don &apos;t you think it &apos;s dangerous
to put caffrey on his trail ?
caffrey &apos;s proven he can take care of himself .
neal , starting immediately , you report to agent rice .
all right , great .
now that we &apos;re all on the same page ,
let &apos;s start with an easy one .
when &apos;s the last time you saw wilkes ?
probably when he tried to kill me .
we pulled the security tapes for ristorante laurienzo .
we got a positive i.d. of wilkes . nice work .
thanks .
something eating you ?
no , it &apos;s just , last time i saw gless ,
he was on the witness stand at my trial ,
explaining why i was able to beat his company &apos;s unbeatable bond .
i &apos;m sure it didn &apos;t do wonders for his reputation .
the man lost his daughter , okay ?
you want his forgiveness ? help get her back .
mr. caffrey . been a long time .
mr. gless , i want you to know --
agent rice thinks you can find the people who took lindsey .
that &apos;s good enough for me .
could you please just ...
take us through what happened one more time ?
i came home from the office .
everything in lindsey &apos;s room was knocked down .
she was gone .
then he called .
i told him i want proof she &apos;s okay .
that &apos;s it .
did he give you any way to get in contact with him ?
no , he , uh ...
he just hung up without giving you his demands ?
would you mind excusing us for a moment ?
neal , may i have a word , please ?
what was that ?
sorry , what &apos;s ...
remind me again .
how much training do you have
interviewing the parents of kidnapping victims ?
you brought me into this .
to consult .
not to take the lead with my witness .
your witness ?
oh , i &apos;m sorry . i thought we were on the same team .
let me get something clear right here , right now .
you &apos;re a tool in my belt .
understand ?
tool in your belt . got it .
you will listen and observe .
if i ask you to do anything , you do it .
if i have a question , answer it .
what if i have a question ?
then you run it by me .
but you do not , under any circumstance ,
address my witness .
oh , god . sounds like a really great deal .
but i think it &apos;ll work better
if you treat me more like a partner .
see , the way peter and i do it is --
i don &apos;t care how you and peter do it .
i care how you and agent rice do it .
i just want to help find his daughter .
you want to help ?
well , then , keep your mouth shut
unless i ask you to open it .
okay ?
what ?
permission to speak ?
what ?
you haven &apos;t found any of
wilkes &apos; prints around the house , have you ?
see , he likes to use found items
from the target location to cover his tracks .
why don &apos;t you check the rubber gloves under the kitchen sink ?
you have any more brilliant ideas
rumbling around that head of yours ?
no , i think that &apos;s it for now .
good . then go wait in the car .
so i told him , if we have that many people in the gallery ,
he has to do something about the a.c.
of course , he didn &apos;t .
and by 10 : 00 , it was like a sauna in there .
so i told him i would spend the night with him
for a million dollars .
i &apos;d have to run it by my husband first .
but , honey , it &apos;s a million dollars .
what do you think ?
i think ...
i think that &apos;s great .
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s great . what ... what did you ask me ?
okay , admit it . you &apos;re worried about neal .
no , i am not worried about neal .
let &apos;s -- let &apos;s just have a nice , quiet lunch
without talking about him , all right ?
that &apos;s a nice deviled ham right there .
what &apos;s the problem ?
oh , something feels wrong about this case .
i don &apos;t trust rice .
rice ?
kimberly rice .
she &apos;s some hot shot from another division .
she &apos;s neal &apos;s handler on this one .
well , honey , if worried about it ,
go down there and check it out .
yeah , it &apos;s bad form to crash another agent &apos;s crime scene .
that &apos;s never stopped you before .
peter !
didn &apos;t expect to see you here .
oh , i had a case in the neighborhood .
thought i &apos;d drop by .
uh @-@ huh .
i &apos;m touched .
you can &apos;t handle being apart from me .
so , this has nothing to do
with looking over rice &apos;s shoulder ?
no , don &apos;t read into it .
how &apos;s it going with rice ?
i see she &apos;s got you babysitting the car .
she called me a tool in her belt .
i bet you &apos;re really starting to miss working with me now .
no , no .
but i could stretch my legs .
thank you .
while we &apos;re out here and you &apos;re stretching your legs ,
wouldn &apos;t hurt to look around .
no .
you know wilkes &apos; m.o.
how would he handle an operation like this ?
a home invasion ?
theoretically , he &apos;d have a driver ,
a strong man , and a lookout .
wilkes wouldn &apos;t trust anyone else to grab the girl .
he &apos;d handle that himself .
so he &apos;s the strong man . commendable .
that leaves the driver right outside there .
now , where was the lookout ?
the sight lines are clean from there
and there .
so you get better cover in the park .
yeah , but the alley gives you eyes
on both sides of the street and the intersection .
let &apos;s go there .
yeah , somebody &apos;s been here .
looking both directions .
making sure the coast is clear .
coat @-@ check stub .
no name or address .
i &apos;ll get it to e.r.t. , see if they can recognize it .
don &apos;t bother . it &apos;s from a club .
more like an underground casino .
it &apos;s one of wilkes &apos; old hangouts .
nice of them to leave this behind for us .
where is caffrey ?
oh , look .
this gotta be fun .
you find gloves ?
there &apos;s a fresh print inside the index finger .
i want this pulled and sent to me asap .
what do you think you &apos;re doing here , agent burke ?
helping you solve your case .
somebody spent some time watching from over there
and dropped this , which , according to my source ,
came from an underground club .
then that &apos;s our next stop .
no . no , wilkes won &apos;t be there with the girl .
if the fbi shows up , he &apos;ll go to ground and cut his losses .
so , why don &apos;t you put on your dancing shoes , caffrey ?
you &apos;re going clubbing !
and , peter ,
next time i find you on my scene ,
i &apos;m filing a report .
you can &apos;t tell , but right now ,
deep down , i &apos;m petrified .
nice !
you &apos;re letting the pantsuit use you as bait to catch wilkes ?
doesn &apos;t that strike you as ...
insane ?
i &apos;m going to a club . feds will be right outside .
this is the same wilkes
that wants you dismembered , right ?
&quot; dismembered &quot; is slightly overstating it .
you &apos;re being paranoid .
paranoia is a skill , the secret to longevity .
did you not join wilkes &apos; crew ,
gather intel from his targets ,
and then totally screw him over ?
they were planning to hurt people with guns .
i don &apos;t like guns .
for all we know , wilkes is on his way to tahiti right now .
for all we know , he &apos;s sharpening his talons
to tear into your spleen .
thanks for your concern , moz , but this little field trip
is my best chance to get the anklet removed .
alex won &apos;t talk to me
about the music box while it &apos;s on .
oh , you professional thieves , so high @-@ maintenance .
i &apos;m washing my hands of this .
rice is here .
duty calls .
i get the apartment .
you know , you kept me waiting
outside of that rich lady &apos;s house for half an hour .
you can &apos;t rush style , agent rice .
took me less time to get ready for my wedding .
it didn &apos;t take .
i &apos;m not surprised .
statistically speaking .
okay , it &apos;s time for you to go fishing , caffrey .
now , listen , this is a hush @-@ hush kind of place .
there &apos;s a good chance they &apos;ll be patting me down .
be a shame if my tracking anklet
blew your case .
cut it .
really ?
i &apos;m not an idiot .
i &apos;m not sending you undercover with that .
go on . lose it .
there you go .
jones .
yeah .
caffrey just removed his anklet .
yeah , rice cleared it .
rice ?
mr. gless , right ? mm .
i &apos;m agent peter burke .
how you holding up ?
oh , had to get out of the house .
agent rice said i could wait here ...
of course .
i didn &apos;t expect caffrey to be so charming .
this would be so much easier
if he acted more like a criminal .
yeah , of course .
i just hope this goes right .
if it helps , i can walk you through it .
what are you worried about most ?
the meeting .
the meeting .
what troubles you about that ?
the kidnapper calls and then asks for a meeting with caffrey
in exchange for lindsey .
that seems too easy .
yeah .
excuse me .
peter , i &apos;m kind of in the middle of something right now , okay ?
you need to get out of there right now .
what are you talking about ?
neal ...
you &apos;re the ransom .
neal .
neal !
have a silver van , leaving the club , no plea .
chase car lost it in traffic .
okay , listen up , people .
for the foreseeable future , you belong to me .
i need traffic feeds from here to yankee stadium .
you sold him out so you could get your picture in the paper .
you hung neal out to dry for a gold star on your resume .
you better watch it , burke .
when we found that coat @-@ check stub for the club ,
you already knew what was going down there , didn &apos;t you ?
but you kept your mouth shut
so everything could go according to plan .
what &apos;s going on here ?
she made a backroom deal with wilkes .
the girl in exchange for neal .
rice , that true ?
a man we believe to be wilkes contacted gless .
he said that he would give lindsey back
if he could have a face @-@ to @-@ face with caffrey .
a face @-@ to @-@ face ?
and you really think wilkes would make good on that ?
it was our one shot to get a lead on wilkes
and follow him back to the girl .
i had agents all over that street .
and how did that work out for you ?
did you get any leads on the girl ?
wilkes made the grab in our one operational blind spot .
then you &apos;re no longer in charge .
peter , you &apos;re officially a part of this show .
i don &apos;t want to hear it , rice .
you report to burke
until you find caffrey and that girl .
top of the morning to you .
monster headache , right ?
it &apos;ll pass .
wilkes .
seeing you again , neal ,
brings back all these old feelings .
if you wanted to meet for lattes ,
you could &apos;ve just called .
this way is better .
pretty good , right ?
had the fed snip your anklet off for me .
she handed you over on a platter .
oh , that &apos;s great .
you &apos;re a lock for kidnapper of the year .
mm , that old caffrey wit .
i love it .
we could &apos;ve been something - thunder and lighting .
but then you had to go and rip me off for , what -- 500 grand ?
i &apos;ll write you a check .
normally , i kill people for that sort of thing .
but ?
but today is your lucky day .
you get to make it up to me .
look , man , what about lindsey ?
you got me .
just let her go .
not yet .
i &apos;m gonna open these doors .
you run or yell ...
i shoot you .
and then i &apos;ll shoot the girl .
let &apos;s get started .
agency booked travel for a gentleman
by the name of thomas loze .
he &apos;s on his way into the country right now .
i need his itinerary --
flight , car service , hotel .
smile .
it &apos;s a chance to put
that silver tongue of yours to good use .
all this trouble to have me infiltrate a travel agency .
what &apos;s your angle ?
ah , i &apos;m your front man , right ?
you don &apos;t want to end up on the surveillance cameras .
you always were quick .
oh , and one more thing .
since we have a lot to do today ,
it &apos;s important you know how serious i am from the jump .
see her ?
her name &apos;s kathy , career receptionist .
kind of lady no one &apos;ll miss , except a couple of her kids .
on that roof is my friend jim .
jim has a sniper rifle aimed at kathy .
i give him the word , bang , lights out .
wave at neal , jim .
and don &apos;t think you can borrow her phone and call for help .
be a sweetheart .
help the lady out .
i &apos;ll get your information , okay ?
but will i get it in two minutes ?
you &apos;re putting me on a clock ?
look , i can convince her . i just need some time .
you don &apos;t have it . busy day .
one minute , 52 seconds and counting .
all right , i &apos;m going .
hi , there . how you doing ?
i &apos;m fine .
my name is nick halden .
i &apos;m an assistant with level one concierge services .
how can i help you ,
nick halden from level one concierge services ?
we got a big client coming to town -- thomas loze .
you booked his travel .
i need to make a week &apos;s worth
of five @-@ star dinner reservations for him ,
only i misplaced his itinerary .
and i blow another account , i &apos;m toast , so ...
so it sounds like you need to find a new line of work , nick .
come again .
you know , people like you really piss me off .
you waltz in here , you flash some sort of grin ,
and you think you can get me to do something
that would get me fired ?
i don &apos;t think so . but have a nice day .
please , please , kathy . i really need this , okay ?
i said , &quot; have a nice day . &quot;
okay .
okay .
and that is exactly what i &apos;m going to tell my son
when i explain to him why daddy lost his job .
his daddy is a failure .
i &apos;m gonna level with you , kathy .
i don &apos;t enjoy catering to rich guys
who spend more on a bottle of courvoisier
than i make in a year ,
but it &apos;s all i got .
who am i to think that i can do this job
and raise a five @-@ year @-@ old all by myself ?
and now i got to tell joey we &apos;re going back to cedar rapids .
it &apos;s gonna break his heart .
but kids bounce back , though . you know , they &apos;re tough .
cedar rapids ?
i &apos;m from iowa city . &quot; u &quot; of &quot; i &quot; &apos; 88 .
no kidding .
you said thomas loze , right ?
yeah , thomas loze .
okay .
thank you .
kathy , while you &apos;re at it ,
i think i might know someone
who &apos;s interested in your rewards program .
okay .
so , now you &apos;ve captured another one of my pawns .
parcheesi is just not your game .
you mock me , but little do you know
you &apos;re just about to march into the teeth of my blockade .
what &apos;s the matter ?
apparently , dante haversham just received an offer
for 20 % off a trip to rio .
and who is dante haversham ?
it &apos;s me .
i have to go .
oh , this does not count as a forfeit .
i will not take your charity , sir .
that &apos;s my boy .
kathy &apos;s children thank you .
you ready for round two ?
yeah , i don &apos;t think i &apos;m up for round two .
that &apos;d be an ill @-@ advised life choice .
why ? you &apos;ll kill me ?
don &apos;t test me , neal .
tell your friend jim to put that red dot on my head
and pull the trigger , if you don &apos;t think i &apos;m serious .
it &apos;s like i &apos;m talking mandarin .
how &apos; bout i kick things off
by killing my sweet , little hostage ?
i &apos;m starting to wonder if you even have lindsey .
why don &apos;t we take a break , let you think about this ?
last thing i want you to do is ...
drag your heels .
please .
get in .
where are we going ?
you talk too much .
tase this man again .
that &apos;s really not -- ah !
i &apos;ve got bolos out on your van description ,
nypd is canvassing the area where neal was taken .
we just found this in gless &apos; mail .
it was sent before caffrey was taken .
hi , daddy .
i &apos;m okay , but you need to do what they ask ...
now .
or i won &apos;t be okay .
i love you .
all right , everybody , watch it again .
anything jumps out at you , call it .
hi , daddy .
i &apos;m okay , but you need to do what they ask ...
now .
place is falling where it stands .
cracks all over the wall . funky windows .
pre @-@ civil war construction .
you hear that ?
foghorn .
no , tugboat horn .
let &apos;s get it isolated . we know she &apos;s by the water .
there are more than 500 miles
of waterfront in the new york area .
i want search teams on the ground now ,
everybody sweeping and canvassing
any waterfront structure
with cracked walls or funky windows .
or i won &apos;t be okay .
i love you .
hey , you okay ?
yeah . yeah , i &apos;m fine .
didn &apos;t even hurt .
lindsey ?
yes . who are you ?
my name is neal caffrey .
i &apos;m with the fbii . i &apos;m here to help you .
really ?
who &apos;s gonna help you ?
i &apos;ll admit , not the greatest rescue .
but the fbii knows we &apos;re here , right ?
no , but the best agent
the bureau has got is looking for us .
really ?
yes , trust me .
if there &apos;s anyone in the world who can find me , it &apos;s him .
nice manners .
you should chew your food .
it &apos;s pretty foul , right ?
yeah .
he burps when he swallows .
nice .
hey , hon .
okay , you need to come home . we have a visitor .
oh , i &apos;m sorry , sweetie ,
but i &apos;m right in the middle of something now .
right . well , i think your something
is connected to the someone who showed up at our front door .
what ? who &apos;s there ?
mozzie . and he &apos;s pretty worked up .
that &apos;s his normal state .
i think it &apos;s important .
if it &apos;s that important , tell him to come to the office .
mozzie in the fbi headquarters ?
yeah , he &apos;s not going .
honey , i don &apos;t have time .
it &apos;s about neal .
i &apos;m on my way .
so , you &apos;ve met lindsey .
now are you gonna join me for round two ?
or does it get ugly ?
what &apos;s round two ?
why would i want to ruin the surprise ?
in or out ?
let &apos;s get this over with .
you know , moz , you never told me
what do you do for a living .
i know that . neither have you .
mrs. suit .
i &apos;m an event planner . i run my own company .
burke premiere events ?
i thought that company was a front for peter .
okay , not everything has a secret meaning .
ah . naiveté .
so sweet .
i bet you believe in the moon landing .
honey ?
in here .
you know , mozzie still won &apos;t tell me what he does for a living .
do you know ?
i know enough not to ask . why are you here ?
i receiv this .
&quot; elite voyages - come frolic with us &quot; ?
look at the e @-@ mail address .
dante haversham .
remember the alias i gave when neal introduced us ?
see , some things do have secret meanings .
i believe you on this one . is neal okay ?
i don &apos;t know .
that &apos;s a distress signal .
i spent a great deal of money
making sure mr. loze &apos;s limo gets quietly sidetracked .
let me guess . i &apos;m his new driver .
he &apos;ll be carrying a titanium briefcase .
your job is to take it .
any suggestions on how i do that ?
come on , man , you know i don &apos;t like guns .
i really don &apos;t like unloaded guns .
be at this address by 4 : 00 , and our business is complete .
i tell you where i &apos;m keeping the girl ,
and we go our separate ways .
but be a minute late or call your fed friends ,
and i make a call .
and lindsey ...
well , you know what happens to lindsey .
you &apos;re not gonna stick around for the show ?
on this one ...
i &apos;ll keep my distance .
any luck on the tip ?
three hours ago , caffrey goes into elite voyages
asking for the itinerary of a thomas loze .
do we know him ?
pulled a file from interpol .
turns out that loze happens to be
a favorite alias of edward reilly .
edward reilly . the hits keep coming .
he &apos;s the go @-@ to guy when v.i.p. criminals
want something valuable moved .
hand @-@ delivers everything himself ,
which is all the guarantee anyone needs .
he &apos;s dangerous .
my guess -- wilkes is snooping around reilly &apos;s itinerary
because he &apos;s planning a surprise for him .
wilkes is planning a rip @-@ off .
yeah , and he &apos;s using neal as the face of his whole show .
reilly &apos;s on an inbound flight from sydney .
he touches down in an hour .
and we &apos;ll be there to meet him .
you happen to know where i can catch a shuttle to the city ?
no need for the cloak and dagger , peter .
wilkes isn &apos;t here .
we &apos;re here to help you get out of this mess , caffrey .
oh , that &apos;s kind of ironic coming from you , agent rice .
listen . this loze guy you &apos;re going after ,
it &apos;s edward reilly .
damn .
no wonder wilkes doesn &apos;t want to be anywhere near this .
you go through with this , reilly will hunt you down .
if i don &apos;t get his briefcase to wilkes by 4 : 00,
he &apos;ll kill lindsey .
you &apos;re sure about that ?
her guard wasn &apos;t wearing a mask .
and he has a silencer .
so , you saw her .
yeah .
where ?
i don &apos;t know . they tased me .
please tell me you &apos;re close to finding her .
we know she &apos;s in an old building near the water .
her guard was eating moo shu pork
from a restaurant called wok of fire .
chinese takeout near the water .
all right , we can work with that . come on .
hey , i &apos;m staying here .
if you don &apos;t get to lindsey in time ...
yeah .
it &apos;s a two @-@ way transceiver .
jones will keep an eye on you .
his team will stay out of sight . don &apos;t do anything stupid .
too late .
good luck .
excuse me .
you dropped this .
i don &apos;t care what you &apos;re doing here .
as a friend , i insist you pull the rip cord .
you got my message .
what &apos;s with the driver &apos;s outfit ?
i &apos;m about to rob edward reilly .
the edward reilly ?
what &apos;s your plan - a gun in the glove compartment ?
that &apos;s your plan - a gun in the glove compartment .
it &apos;s a long story , but one way or another ,
i &apos;m taking his briefcase .
well , surely you won &apos;t do this
because you &apos;re not suicidal !
thanks for the pep talk .
but what if he gave it to you ...
... and was happy to give it to you ?
zigzag scam ?
one for me . one for you .
time to get into character .
you &apos;re a chameleon .
yeah .
mr. loze ?
my name &apos;s nick . i &apos;ll be your driver today .
been on a plane for 22 hours .
i don &apos;t give a damn what your name is , kid .
got any other bags ?
no .
let me take your case for you .
just take me to the car .
thomas loze ?
agent haversham .
immigration and customs enforcement .
word is you &apos;re bringing something into the country
we should know about .
this a joke ?
do i look like i &apos;m joking , elvis ?
agent halden , joint task force .
we &apos;re gonna need you to open the case .
doesn &apos;t have to be a scene if you don &apos;t want it to be .
okay .
you guys really want to do this ?
knock yourselves out .
let &apos;s go .
palms on the table .
this looks like an overnight bag .
when this is through , i want badge numbers .
you can &apos;t prove probable cause .
it &apos;ll be both your asses .
shut your hole and kiss wood , reilly !
yeah , we know who you really are .
i just said that to a guy
who enjoys killing people with his bare hands .
keep it together , moz .
hold on a second .
pure gold .
think they &apos;re preloaded ?
well , that would explain wilkes &apos; interest in them .
load &apos; em up with a couple hundred thousand each .
and you &apos;ve got a portable fortune ,
perfect for the smuggler on the go .
i want my lawyer .
oh , you &apos;ll need him , chachi !
i &apos;d say you &apos;re staring down 10 years , easy .
call the cavalry .
imagine what you could do
with just one of these babies , huh ?
make for a great night out .
call it in , haversham .
it &apos;s just -- i promised sarah that necklace .
with the diamonds .
so ?
so , she &apos;s gonna leave me , man .
and you think this is the way to keep her ?
look , this isn &apos;t the way .
oh , don &apos;t tell me how to keep a woman , blue eyes .
guys like you , with your million @-@ dollar smile
and your thick , perfect head of hair --
you don &apos;t get it !
don &apos;t do this to yourself , okay ?
listen .
this is my suitcase , right ?
so , maybe i left it on the plane ?
what ? i got to spell this out for you gentlemen ?
all right , call it in .
tell him loze was clean . we cut him loose .
come on . call it in .
you guys are all right .
got to get home somehow , right ?
that &apos;s the closest i &apos;ve come to death this year .
all right , thanks for your help , moz .
could i ..
no , no .
this is the closest dock to wok of fire .
that sounds like our tugboat horn .
so , where &apos;s our girl ?
i hope you &apos;re feeling lucky .
it &apos;s almost 4 : 00 . caffrey &apos;s out of time .
neal , you copy ?
neal , you copy ?
tell me you found lindsey .
we &apos;re gonna need more time .
it &apos;s 4 : 00 , peter . i &apos;m already here .
then stall .
he gets his hands on the case , the girl &apos;s dead .
right on time .
i love that .
where &apos;s the girl ?
unfortunately , i won &apos;t be sharing that information with you .
we had a deal , wilkes .
i lied .
give it to me .
and i thought we had a nice thing going on .
you lied , i lied . it &apos;s like a dance .
you pull that trigger , and all those gold cards
i just stole from edward reilly are gone forever .
wait , wait .
give me the still from that proof @-@ of @-@ life tape .
what do you see ?
same crack in the wall .
that &apos;s our place .
we got &apos; em .
i don &apos;t have those cards in my hand in 10 seconds ,
i &apos;m gonna make a call , and i &apos;m gonna kill the girl !
then i &apos;m gonna take my time with you .
five seconds .
three seconds .
now my guys are gonna have to kill that nice man &apos;s daughter .
who says they &apos;re still your guys ?
is that your play ?
you turned my crew against me ?
i expected more from you .
who do you think has the gold cards ?
you left them with my guys . you &apos;re not that dumb .
you brought me into this because i bring up the average .
unfortunately , that makes you less valuable .
your men agreed - it &apos;s time for new management .
you &apos;re lying . call them if you think i &apos;m bluffing .
i think you &apos;re bluffing .
yeah , boss ?
kill her . and leave the phone on speaker .
put it down ! now !
get down now ! hands on your head !
damn it !
sounds like they got company .
i guess that makes you obsolete .
now , i wouldn &apos;t do that if i were you .
see , i got friends with sniper rifles , too .
fbi ! drop your weapon !
drop your weapon right now ! hands in the air !
agent burke , we got wilkes .
we &apos;re secure here . we got the girl .
what about neal ?
he says hey .
dad !
lindsey .
dad !
where you been ? you missed all the action .
oh , yeah . i got hung up with an old friend .
how &apos;d that go ?
think i may have burned a bridge .
looks like agent rice is ready for her close @-@ up .
heard the camera crews are already on their way .
let her have it .
oh , geez . did she just give us the finger @-@ point ?
she did .
agent rice says you &apos;re the men
responsible for bringing my daughter back .
we &apos;re all a team here .
mr. gless ...
i &apos;d say we &apos;re more than even now , caffrey .
thanks for playing round two .
don &apos;t mention it .
was a hell of a thing you did today .
i could say the same thing about you .
no hard feelings ?
don &apos;t stretch it .
oh , uh , you &apos;re not sticking around for the press ?
you &apos;re the hottest interview in town .
i probably have a disciplinary hearing to prepare for anyway .
about how things went down last night --
oh , look . in the end , we got it done .
yeah , even so , i hope we work together again sometime ...
even if you &apos;re the one calling the shots .
one day , i &apos;ll remind you that you said that .
got caffrey &apos;s anklet .
i thought your people already put it on him ?
not me . he &apos;s your consultant , remember ?
anybody seen caffrey ?
damn it . you got to be kidding me .
jones , let &apos;s check the usual suspects .
you &apos;re late .
long day .
what &apos;s with the outfit ?
long story .
congratulations . how &apos;d you do it ?
you &apos;d be surprised what i can get done in a day .
i kept my promise . it &apos;s your turn .
i give you this .
and we get the music box together .
no , i told you -- it &apos;s&apos;s yours when i &apos;m through with it .
see , i don &apos;t like the sound of that .
we split it 50 / 50 .
what are you gonna do with half a music box ?
and if you screw me on this ,
you know i can make your life miserable .
when did you become so distrusting ?
when what happened with kate .
happened ?
yeah .
that &apos;s over now .
nice flower .
i learned from the best .
you go halfway around the world chasing something ,
and the whole time , it &apos;s in your own backyard .
see you soon , caffrey .
forget something ?
made it all the way home before i realized it was gone .
just slipped your mind ?
i came back .
what did alex have to say ?
you had a long brown hair on your jacket .
how many other brunettes you meet before work ?
don &apos;t answer that .
all your brunettes seem to be connected to that music box .
you and alex are planning to steal it , aren &apos;t you ?
she &apos;s just an old friend .
she &apos;s a fence , neal .
she either knows how to find things ...
or sell them .
people like that don &apos;t trust the fbi .
that &apos;s why you walked away without your anklet .
that &apos;s a fascinating theory .
i &apos;m willing to look past
your little trip off the reservation
because you did well today .
thank you .
don &apos;t .
just remember how it felt
when you saw that girl in her father &apos;s arms .
moments like that are rare .
but if you try to steal the music box , i will catch you .
is that a threat ?
just the way it is .
you know , you can either go back
to wearing an orange jumpsuit
and pining for the girl that got away ...
or you can stay here and do something good with your life .
