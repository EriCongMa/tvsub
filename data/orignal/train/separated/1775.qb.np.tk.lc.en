sheldon cooper &apos;s descent into madness ...
day two .
it &apos;s 2 : 25 a.m. ,
and i feel the urge to urinate .
my normal urination time is 7 : 10 a.m. ,
but here i am , in the middle of the night ,
struggling to keep my mind sharp
and my pajamas dry .
it &apos;s only a matter of time
before my tenuous grasp on reality fades .
i suppose i should pee while i still know what a toilet is .
since when do you hum songs ?
what are you talking about ?
you were just humming .
are you sure ?
sometimes when my brain really gets moving ,
it makes noise .
how does your brain feel about
calculating the surface tension of the domain walls ?
let &apos;s see .
hey ! i was humming .
one point for hufflepuff .
what song is that ?
well ... hum it again .
is that the spongebob song ?
♪ who lives in a pineapple ? ♪
nope .
whatever . can we just get back to this ?
i feel like i know what song that is ,
but i can &apos;t put my finger on it .
♪ my country , &apos; tis of thee ♪
no .
it &apos;s just an earworm . it &apos;ll come to you .
okay .
♪ r @-@ e @-@ s @-@ p @-@ e @-@ c @-@ t ♪
no .
is this what we &apos;re doing the rest of the night ?
♪ i &apos;m surprised you have to ask ... ♪
hello , yes , i was hoping you could help me .
what song is this ?
you don &apos;t know ?
well , how dare you call yourselves a rock and roll hall of fame ?
my goodness . do you sing along to the greatest hits
of elvis presley with that mouth ?
well , they were no help at all .
which is crazy ,
since rock and roll is all about good customer service .
yeah . so you have a song stuck in your head .
it happens to everybody .
well , i &apos;m not everybody . i have an eidetic memory .
i should be able to remember what song this is ,
but i can &apos;t .
something &apos;s wrong with me .
i told you if we were patient , he &apos;d figure it out for himself .
oh ... i was always afraid this day would come .
this might be the first step of my descent into madness ,
where i gradually test the limits of public nudity .
public nudity ?
eh , that just means going barefoot .
hello ?
hi , dave .
uh , it &apos;s amy .
oh . how are you ?
i &apos;m fine . how are you ?
terrific . and pleasantly surprised to hear from you ,
given how i acted on our last date .
yeah , well , we both made mistakes , you know .
i took the last breadstick , you gushed over my ex @-@ boyfriend
like he was leonard nimoy and you were my ex @-@ boyfriend .
so , to what do i owe the pleasure ?
well , i was wondering
if you &apos;d like to get dinner again sometime .
yes , please .
great .
let me just check my schedule , he said ,
trying to seem like a man with things on his schedule .
how &apos; bout saturday ?
uh , hmm ... let me see .
uh , friday , farmers &apos; market with jay z.
sunday , piano shopping with elton john .
saturday works .
oh . did you know , at the united nations ,
there &apos;s a department for outer space affairs ?
really ? why ?
they exist in case we ever make contact with an alien civilization .
mm , boy , that &apos;s one of those jobs that &apos;s boring , boring ,
boring , then , &quot; oh , god !
where &apos;s the memo with what we do now ? ! &quot;
oh , this is cool .
so , a few weeks ago ,
i set up a fan page on facebook for our band and ...
wait a second .
how could you do that without consulting me ?
it &apos;s not a big deal .
it just took , like , five minutes to set up .
that &apos;s not the point .
when we created footprints on the moon ,
we agreed that every band decision would be mutual .
now you &apos;re just trying to take over the whole thing .
you know , maybe i should go solo .
but someone joined our page .
we have an actual fan .
all right . this thing &apos;s bigger than you and me--
band &apos;s back together .
so , listen to what he wrote .
uh , &quot; i saw you play at the comic book store .
you guys rock . &quot;
and then there &apos;s a animated smiley face
raising the roof like this ...
we did raise the roof that night .
yeah , we totally did .
why do rock stars do drugs when this feels so great ?
♪ why can &apos;t i recall this song ? ♪
♪ this is taking far too long . ♪
♪ the urge to bang my head against the wall ♪
♪ again and again and again and again and again is strong . ♪
put on some headphones .
♪ no . they make my earlobes sweat . ♪
uh , sweetie , why don &apos;t you take a break
and do something else for a while ?
there was a project i &apos;ve been thinking about starting .
okay , great . what is it ?
i &apos;ll show you .
dear crazy future sheldon ,
you were driven mad by an earworm .
your mind , once your most trusted asset ,
is now a sack of parrots and monkeys .
so ...
i &apos;m going to tell you everything you need to know .
uh , first , music is dangerous .
the movie footloose tried to warn us ,
but we wouldn &apos;t listen .
oh , wait .
♪ everybody cut footloo ... ♪
nope .
i &apos;ll pay $ 1,000 to watch you cut footloose .
this is penny .
she is your friend .
if she offers you food , it &apos;s safe to take it .
you probably paid for it , anyway .
so , you &apos;re really going out with dave again ?
why not ?
he &apos;s actually a very nice guy .
but he spent an entire date
talking about how much he loves sheldon .
that &apos;s nothing sheldon hasn &apos;t done before .
dave &apos;s just a big fan of his work .
besides , he said he wouldn &apos;t bring it up again .
okay . so where &apos;s he taking you ?
oh , he &apos;s coming here . i &apos;m actually making dinner .
oh . that &apos;s a big step .
it is ?
yeah . you &apos;re inviting him into your home .
it &apos;s intimate .
it &apos;s where your underpants live .
you know what ? good .
i tried to get back together with sheldon ; he shot me down ;
dave likes me .
maybe intimate is what i need .
you sure ?
you &apos;ve never really been with a man .
do you really want to start with one that &apos;s six @-@ foot @-@ seven ?
why not ?
&apos;cause it &apos;s like taking your driver &apos;s test in a bus .
maybe we should post a comment back to our fan and thank him .
what should we write ?
how &apos; bout , uh ... oh , how &apos; bout ,
&quot; we might be footprints on the moon ,
but your kind words sent us over the moon . &quot;
someday you &apos;re gonna make an amazing grandma .
what do you want to write ?
something bad @-@ ass , you know , like ...
&quot; thanks for diggin &apos; our vibe .
we &apos;ll keep rockin&apos;
if you keep rollin &apos; . &quot;
dude , if i was wearing a bra ,
i &apos;d throw it at your head right now .
i &apos;ll keep rockin &apos; . you don &apos;t do that .
okay . i posted it .
so , who is this guy ?
let &apos;s see . uh , his name is trent monaco .
cool name .
yeah .
he &apos;s 24 . he &apos;s a deejay .
he brews his own beer . he &apos;s got awesome tattoos .
dude , he &apos;s got a hot girlfriend , too .
damn .
i don &apos;t know if he &apos;s our biggest fan or i &apos;m his .
hey , trent just liked our comment .
he is so cool !
no hard feelings ,
but i &apos;m throwing my hypothetical bra at him .
oh , my god , he won &apos;t stop .
how does he keep coming up with new ways to be annoying ?
nobody knows . that &apos;s why he &apos;s number one .
can you please go talk to him ?
come on . i take care of him all day long . you do it for once .
once ? who got the gum out of his hair ?
what do you want , a medal ? it was your gum .
fine .
i love you .
who cares ?
what are you doing in my room ? i ...
stop it ! that &apos;s mine !
why are you so strong ? !
problem solved .
oh , yeah , he got a tuba .
dear crazy future sheldon ...
this is a thermostat .
it controls the temperature of the apartment .
the ideal setting is 72 degrees .
if you find this too cold , then put on a jacket .
a straitjacket ,
&apos;cause 72 &apos;s the best and you &apos;re crazy .
now ... this ...
is your spot .
you &apos;re very protective of it .
when anyone else tries to sit here ,
you berate them relentlessly .
it sounds mean , but somehow you make it adorable .
people are also delighted by your love of pranks .
for example , leonard has no idea
what i did to his coffee .
it wasn &apos;t &quot; replace it with folger &apos;s crystals , &quot;
i &apos;ll tell you that much .
hey , can we please get back to work ?
this is leonard .
he &apos;s your best friend in the world .
all right , just stop . this is ridiculous .
sometimes he gets cranky ,
but you can trust him with your life .
and he does more things for you than i can even begin to list .
thank you .
oh , no , he &apos;s drinking it .
look at this .
trent is rebuilding a vintage motorcycle .
that is so cool !
old broken things are so much better
than new things that work .
who &apos;s trent ?
oh , he &apos;s our fan .
fan of what ?
did you forget ? we &apos;re in a band .
you mean because you played one time in the comic book store ?
and at the children &apos;s hospital until they asked us to leave .
hey , dude ,
trent just checked in at the coffee shop on fair oaks .
really ? you want to go down there and meet him ?
are you stalking him ? that &apos;s creepy .
it &apos;s not creepy .
i built a footprints on the moon fan page , trent joined it .
after that , all i did was check out his profile ,
go back in the archive of his feed
until i found his twitter handle .
from there , it was easy to find him on instagram , snapchat
and pretty much track his every movement .
so if you think that &apos;s creepy , you married the wrong guy .
maybe i should marry trent .
yeah , like she could get trent .
this is delicious .
thank you .
been a long time since i had a home @-@ cooked meal .
when you were married , did your wife cook ?
not at first , no .
but when she began cheating on me with a french chef ,
she became quite the wiz in the kitchen .
so , a little silver lining .
i suppose . yeah .
nothing takes the sting out of a shattered life
like a properly @-@ seasoned bowl of onion soup .
how long have you , uh , lived here ?
about five years .
i &apos;m actually thinking of moving to a better place
now that i don &apos;t need to be so close to ...
well , you know .
i do . the brilliant physicist
that i now know lives in the area , not that i care .
yeah . anyway , he doesn &apos;t drive ,
so , i pretty much had to take him everywhere .
had to or got to ?
sorry .
my fault .
i brought him up .
yeah .
well , let &apos;s change the subject .
no more mentions of you @-@ know @-@ who .
that &apos;s a cool train .
where did you get that ?
this song is never going to stop .
have you ever dealt with something so relentlessly irritating ?
that &apos;s a trick question , right ?
well , i shouldn &apos;t be surprised .
there &apos;s a rich history of brilliant minds descending into madness .
come on , sheldon .
there are plenty of smart people who don &apos;t have mental problems .
yup , she &apos;s right .
for every newton who had a psychological issue ,
there &apos;s an edison who was just a jerk .
that could totally be you .
empedocles thought he was a god and jumped into a volcano .
and pythagoras had an irrational fear of beans .
tesla fell madly in love with a pigeon
who he claimed loved him back .
maybe he just had bread in his pocket .
the list extends outside of science .
painters like van gogh and pollock ,
chess champion bobby fischer ,
brian wilson of the beach boy ...
♪ know if words could say ♪
♪ but darlin &apos; , i &apos;ll find a way ♪
i remember the song !
it &apos;s called &quot; darlin &apos; &quot; by the beach boys !
oh , thank goodness !
i &apos;m not crazy !
i don &apos;t have to take a pigeon as my bride !
there goes our shot at him living on the roof .
so , all right , there he is .
so , should we introduce ourselves ?
no ! let him spot us .
i wonder if he &apos;s listening to our music right now .
could you imagine ?
what a cool way for us to meet .
he &apos;s playing our song and looks up , and there we are--
his favorite two @-@ piece acoustic sci @-@ fi novelty rock band .
and he &apos;s , all , like ,
&quot; aren &apos;t you the guys from footprints on the moo ... ? &quot;
ooh , what is he doing ? !
i can &apos;t watch .
i @-@ i @-@ it &apos;s okay .
oh , it &apos;s okay . he &apos;s done .
why is he looking at it ? !
eh , no , he &apos;s not going to eat it , is he ?
come on , trent , you &apos;re better than ...
let &apos;s just go .
hey , aren &apos;t you the guys ... ?
nope !
never heard of &apos; em !
♪ know if words could say ♪
♪ but darlin &apos; , i &apos;ll find a way ♪
i wonder why it was this particular song
that was stuck in my head .
i don &apos;t know . it &apos;s pretty catchy .
do you even like the beach boys ?
they have &quot; beach &quot; right in the name .
what do you think ?
well , now that you can focus again , what do you say
we get back to surface tension of domain walls ?
of course . i &apos;m already seeing a more efficient way
of taming the ultravi ...
i know why the song was in my head .
why ?
it &apos;s about amy .
okay , look , i know amy &apos;s like an old lady ,
but she &apos;s not old enough to have a song
from the &apos; 60s written about her .
it &apos;s about how she made my life better .
consider the lyrics .
&quot; i was living like half a man .
then i couldn &apos;t love , but now i can .
more soul than i ever had .
i love the way you soften my life . &quot;
well , she did soften your life , didn &apos;t she ?
yes !
she &apos;s like the dryer sheets of my heart !
i have to go .
am i like the dryer sheets of your heart ?
better . you &apos;re the lint trap of my love .
that &apos;s an interesting tie clip .
oh , thanks .
it &apos;s , uh , avogadro &apos;s constant .
it &apos;s useful for calculating the number of atoms in a substance ,
or causing regret in anyone who asks about it .
oh , i ...
i think it &apos;s neat .
sorry . sorry .
no one &apos;s ever liked the tie clip before ,
so i just lost all control .
no , it ... it &apos;s okay , and we are on a date .
i &apos;m ... i &apos;m just a little nervous .
well , no need to be nervous with me .
i &apos;m just a harmless giant from a foreign land .
you know , i &apos;m just being silly . i ...
i don &apos;t know what i &apos;m waiting for .
amy ?
amy .
amy ?
that &apos;s sheldon .
you &apos;re kidding ! how &apos;s my hair ?
sheldon , this @-@ this isn &apos;t a good time .
i don &apos;t care .
amy , there was a song i couldn &apos;t get out of my head .
eventually , i realized the song was about you ,
and like that earworm , i can &apos;t get you out of my heart .
so , what i &apos;m trying to say is ,
you &apos;re my heartworm .
the metaphorical kind , not @-@ not the poodle @-@ killing kind .
w @-@ w @-@ w @-@ what ?
if i may ...
i believe what he &apos;s saying ,
in a charming and delightful way ,
is that he loves you and wants you back .
dave gibbs , huge fan of your work .
don &apos;t mind me .
i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m sorry . i didn &apos;t realize you were on a date .
no , it @-@ it ... it &apos;s okay . keep going ?
amy , if you want to be my girlfriend again ,
i really want to be your boyfriend .
i really want that , too .
good . because i love you .
i love you , too .
kiss her , you brilliant fool !
i &apos;ll let you get back to your date .
get back here !

okay , then .
i &apos;ll , uh , see myself out .
amy , thank you for dinner .
dr. cooper , pleasure to meet you , sir .
