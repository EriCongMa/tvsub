here &apos;s your check .
i didn &apos;t charge you for the fries , &apos; cause i ate them .
max , look out !
the diner water bugs are getting really big .
relax , it &apos;s the diner &apos;s new surveillance drone .
god , you empty the register five or ten times ,
suddenly there &apos;s no trust .
so to be clear , we &apos;re out of soap but we have a drone ?
i hate that han &apos;s just sitting in back , watching us ,
working his little joy stick .
please , no one &apos;s getting any joy out of han &apos;s little stick .
this is so annoying .
it &apos;s following me .
well , with a butt that flat , it &apos;s the only black thing
that &apos;s ever going to follow you .
ugh , there &apos;s another drone out here ?
i just killed one in the kitchen with a fly swatter .
go .
i mean , if i wanted to be spied on ,
i &apos;d change my name to achmed ,
and buy a condo near the airport .
whatever happened to buying a painting of an old sea captain ,
drilling out the eye holes , and hiding behind it ?
not cool , han .
and the worst part is , it &apos;s moving around so much ,
i can &apos;t find my good angle .
not cool and not han .
i stole this while he was explaining to me
why a 77 @-@ year @-@ old man , on minimum wage ,
doesn &apos;t need health care .
earl , that is awesome .
not really . i need that health care .
no , that you stole that .
we need to do something that will make han
never want to spy on us again .
oleg , open your pants .
earl , fly that camera in there .
but first , take off your underwear .
underwear ?
come on . what am i , five ?
inches ?
oleg , aren &apos;t you at all worried about earl &apos;s cataracts ?
best case scenario , i get a little manscaping .
worst case , i &apos;ve been meaning to get circumcised .
my eyes !
max , i &apos;m writing out the check for our bank loan ,
and i &apos;m not quite sure what our balance is
because here under &quot; withdrawals &quot; you just wrote , &quot; yeah . &quot;
well , if you don &apos;t like that , you &apos;re really not going to like
the picture i drew under &quot; deposits . &quot;
i saw it .
max , zeroes are not balls , they &apos;re not boobs ,
and they &apos;re not googly eyes .
they &apos;re just zeroes .
says you .
i &apos;ll go check our balance at the atm .
even though the last guy who touched it
had a cold sore so big ,
具有传染性 可通过餐具 毛巾 皮肤接触等传染
i charged him for a party of two .
don &apos;t worry . you are not going to get anything from that machine .
especially cash .
hey , everybody .
somebody better make me some eggs
because i &apos;ve been on a juice cleanse for three hours ,
3天到数周不等的疗程 基本只喝各种调配好的果汁
and i &apos;m dizzy .
yeah . i mean , they call it a fast ,
but it sure does go slow .
i was on a three weeks fast , once .
then i realized my mother wasn &apos;t coming home .
so i made a sandwich .
oleg and my wedding is coming up
and we &apos;re trying to eat clean .
yeah , baby ,
&apos;cause you know we &apos;re eating dirty on the honeymoon .
oh , dear god , what ?
another used condom in the receipt slot ?
worse .
what ?
stuff that should be in a condom but isn &apos;t ?
we &apos;re below zero .
oh , well , i better go , y &apos;all .
a white woman screaming anywhere in my vicinity
never turns out well .
this is a disaster .
i &apos;ve been at zero ,
but i &apos;ve never had less than zero .
oh , don &apos;t say that , caroline .
i mean , you &apos;re forgetting about your dating options .
we have less than zero money
and no way of paying off our bank loan .
oh , my god . it happened .
i &apos;m working class .
hey . i &apos;ve waited tables with you for four years
and there &apos;s no way you could call what you do working .
cupcakes !
buy cupcakes .
buy cupcakes !
stop .
you look more desperate than justin bieber
in that calvin klein ad .
you don &apos;t understand the seriousness of this bank situation .
you don &apos;t understand the rules of world of warcraft .
the loan just keeps escalating and escalating
until they close us down .
cupcakes ! buy cupcakes !
buy cupcakes ! buy cupcakes !
oh , pay @-@ dirt . look .
here comes a big , fat frat house guy .
hey , bitches .
remember me ?
big mary .
that &apos;s my name . don &apos;t wear it out .
john , we haven &apos;t seen you since pastry school .
hey , for old times &apos; sake , want to buy a cupcake ?
a dozen ? the shop ?
so i came because i may know of a way
for max to make some extra money .
whatever it is , she &apos;ll do it .
that was my yearbook quote .
i just got hired at a new restaurant
that &apos;s opening under the high line park in manhattan ,
and they are looking for another day pastry chef .
i only have a year of pastry school
and i was stoned for , like , a year of that .
i don &apos;t know if i have the skills .
oh , girl , you don &apos;t .
but the manager , joe , wants only pretty people .
and what you lack in pastry ,
you more than make up for in pretty .
she &apos;ll do it . you &apos;ll do it , max .
and john will be there to help back you up with his pastry skills .
and &apos; cause i &apos;m pretty .
i don &apos;t belong in a place like that .
it &apos;s called &quot; the high . &quot;
sounds right . give me the deets .
well , good night girls .
sorry about your bank balance .
but i trust you &apos;ll both lapse
into denial fairly soon , as always .
hello .
who was she ?
hold me closer , tiny dancer .
oh ... han &apos;s not gay .
you forgot the &quot; yet . &quot;
max , maybe button up a button or two .
it &apos;s a dessert bar . not a strip bar .
hey , i need this job ,
and once this joe guy takes one look at these puff pastries ,
he might cut me some slack when he sees my other
&quot; not so puff &quot; pastries .
and you &apos;re comfortable with that ?
yup .
like i guess you &apos;re comfortable applying for a waitress job
on just the merits of your waitress skills .
should i keep going ?
why ?
i &apos;m here .
i &apos;ll take those applications . hurry , ladies .
if i was looking for pretty and slow , i &apos;d hire nick jonas .
max , let &apos;s get out of here .
she reminds me of this nightmare
i &apos;m going to have for the rest of my life .
relax , she &apos;s just his guard dog .
it &apos;s joe guy we have to impress .
no thank you .
no thank you .
and how dare you ?
oh , i &apos;m sorry , the restaurant doesn &apos;t open until tomorrow .
actually , no .
hi . i &apos;m here to apply for a waitress job .
at your age ?
i &apos;m 27 !
and ?
max , i can &apos;t breathe .
and i &apos;m here to apply for a pastry chef .
also 27 , but i &apos;ve looked this old since i was 6 .
for a while , i thought i had that benjamin button &apos;s disease .
i &apos;ll take the pastry chef first .
why don &apos;t you sit over there and wait .
i won &apos;t be long , because frankly ,
you don &apos;t have the time .
thank you . i &apos;ll be over there .
applying for social security .
so where did you go to pastry school ,
and why aren &apos;t you working now ?
manhattan school of pastry , and i am working .
i have my own cupcake shop in brooklyn .
oh , it &apos;s almost over .
this interview ? great .
no . not the interview . brooklyn .
brooklyn &apos;s almost over .
also , cupcakes .
cool . i will tell them .
wish i knew that before they all got
their belly buttons pierced trying to stay cool .
oh , great . a sense of humor .
customers love that .
i don &apos;t , but they do .
so , um , where &apos;s this joe guy who &apos;s doing the hiring ?
there is no &quot; joe guy . &quot; i &apos;m joe .
spelled , j @-@ o @-@ e @-@ d @-@ t @-@ h.
the d @-@ t @-@ h is silent .
as am i , because i want this job .
well , i guess i can put these away then .
that was your plan ?
to expose your breasts and seduce your way into this job ?
you say that like it &apos;s a bad thing .
okay . well , bye .
sit , sit .
if you really can bake ,
this position might be perfect for you .
also , you have that edgy ,
&quot; i don &apos;t give a crap &quot; attitude .
customers love that .
i don &apos;t , but they do .
actually , joe , silent d @-@ t @-@ h , i can bake .
but how well ?
my girlfriend and i are obsessed with french pastry .
oh . girlfriend as in &quot; girlfriend , &quot;
or as in two ladies of a certain age
at a cineplex splitting one thing of popcorn ?
everything you just said offended me .
yeah , that &apos;s my brand .
and the fact that you didn &apos;t cry
about splitting a popcorn makes me think
it &apos;s the first kind of girlfriend .
how are your macaroons ?
my macaroons ?
great .
a little bit of french heaven .
what is your name ?
max .
m @-@ a @-@ x .
nothing is silent . ever .
so i gather .
okay . why don &apos;t you go fill out an application , max .
and you can put those away again .
i &apos;m really not into big @-@ breasted women .
girl , you got this .
first day . are you nervous , girl ?
please . nervous is telling your elderly mormon parents
that you &apos;re gay after your three older siblings
already came out .
i have no idea what most of these desserts are .
i haven &apos;t felt this lost since the finale of lost .
max , can you see any of the barney &apos;s price tags on these ?
uh , i think there &apos;s one bunching up
inside the back of your pants .
no , that &apos;s the underwear i &apos;m also returning .
here she comes .
hi , ladies . this is naomi ,
the dessert bar hostess .
go , naomi , go .
gorgeous , but as dumb as whoever is the hot new idiot right now .
let me take a look at you .
good @-@ bye .
already ?
those pearls . they have to go .
really ? it &apos;s just , well ,
i &apos;m kind of emotionally attached to them .
well , honey , i love my half @-@ blind french bulldog ,
but i don &apos;t wear her around my neck .
max , let me take a look .
love it .
fabulous . well done .
hi , joe . big day . i &apos;m so excited .
why don &apos;t you be excited in the back , doll ?
i want max up front now .
all my life , people have been telling me not to come out .
why should here be any different ?
ladies , i just got word
that the new york times food critic
may make a surprise visit this afternoon .
everything has to be perfect--
the service , the desserts ,
the precarious balance of my meds .
nothing can go wrong .
naomi .
fetch .
&quot; welcome to the high . &quot;
&quot; hi . welcome to the high . &quot;
&quot; welcome to the high . &quot;
stop saying high . it reminds me i &apos;m not .
wait , max , you &apos;re not high ?
like , not high at all ?
no . i didn &apos;t want to screw today up .
what the hell is wrong with you ?
you can &apos;t change who you are today .
the new york times is coming .
how will you cope ?
i mean , when &apos;s the last time you weren &apos;t high ?
my birth .
but i was really drunk .
i had just had a bottle of wine .
well , my mother had .
i have to go wait on those customers .
do what you can to get with the program .
i mean , get off the program .
you can &apos;t bake not baked .
big mary ?
john ?
why not try my new name ?
quasimodo .
do you have any weed ?
do i have any weed ?
let me check my hump .
nope . no weed .
thanks , rico . i didn &apos;t want to ask
due to the city @-@ wide ban on racial profiling .

max , i need two lavender macaroons .
where are they ?
i &apos;m working on them .
well , good . i &apos;m so proud of you .
this is so freaky friday .
here are the lavender macaroons .
see ? even just holding this , i &apos;m better .
now we just have to hope nothing goes wrong .
surprise !
we all came to support you .
well , that &apos;s it .
the new york times food critic may be in the same room
as han , earl , oleg , and sophie .
we &apos;re dead . time of death , 11 : 30 .
i believe it &apos;s more like 4 : 20 .
oh , caroline , i love your new place .
it &apos;s so fresh and pretty .
it kind of looks like a douche commercial .
you &apos;re right , baby .
it looks exactly like a douche commercial .
okay . can we stop saying &quot; douche &quot;
in the fancy pastry shop ?
i agree . not appropriate .
caroline , darling , slip my phone number
to that fine nubian princess .
and tell her not to be fooled by my bad hip .
i can still gently rock her world .
okay , guys , what are you doing here
and how quickly can you leave ?
real nice .
after we came all this way to just order only desserts
that max knows how to make
and to say nice things about you as a waitress .
oh , you &apos;d do that for me ?
hell no , i can &apos;t pull that off .
if i could act , i &apos;d sell the restaurant
and get cast in two @-@ line roles as the doctor
on any network television show .
sophie &apos;s the actress .
and trust me , she &apos;s got quite a repertoire .
in bed , i call her meryl sheets .

do it , baby .
oh , what a lovely place .
that &apos;s the accent she uses when we play
&quot; 12 years a sex slave . &quot;
lovely , be right back .
oh , and , welcome to the high .
what &apos;s going on with that table ?
is there a european circus in town ?
a circus ? well , i wouldn &apos;t know .
i really have no idea who they are .
that didn &apos;t require an answer .
it was just one of my dead @-@ on observations .
just get rid of them .
tell them we &apos;ve run out of funnel cakes .
well , i &apos;m feeling like my old self .
joe just told me to lose han , earl , oleg , and sophie .
how am i supposed to lose that many people ?
i &apos;m not air traffic control .
you are acting like they don &apos;t know how to act in a fancy place .
girls , look !
oleg &apos;s wearing his napkin as a party hat .
here &apos;s your dessert . bon appetite .
max , i can &apos;t believe you just made that .
neither can i.
and what did you say to oleg and sophie ?
it &apos;s been an hour , and i haven &apos;t seen
any over @-@ the @-@ table penetration .
i just told them to be on their best behavior ,
and they &apos;re fine with it .
excuse me , max .
yes , hi .
may i go tinkle ?
or is that against the law here at guantanamo dessert bay ?
i &apos;m gonna go have sex in the ladies room .
unless you two prudes have a problem with that , too .
excuse me .
can i get a latte and a red wine ?
&apos;cause i got a vicodin stuck in my throat .
oh , my god .
who could be that messed up
in the middle of the afternoon ?
uh , my new best friend .
i better get rid of her before joe
or that times critic walks in .
you keep doing good things by accident .
hi , can i get a--
you sure can . anywhere but here .
oh , no . spinning &apos;s not good for me right now .
what is she doing here ?
leaving . you never saw her .
wait--
joe , i got this .
my bestie at school was totally hooked
on prescription pills for , like , a week .
hey , hi , you .
excuse me . where is max ?
she &apos;s in the back for a sec .
so ...
we meet again .
sir , do you need something in the back ?
yes , caroline said she &apos;d bring me a napkin ,
but i could get time warner on the phone faster than that .
just ask max .
she covers for caroline all the time at the diner .
max ?
ooh . drama at the high .
han , that &apos;s my new boss .
stop talking .
also , stop collecting stickers . you &apos;re a grown @-@ up .
okay , i threw that drug addict out .
that drug addict is my girlfriend .
more drama at the high .
and caroline , we have a problem .
you called allie a drug addict .
oh , is that her name ?
allie ? so cute .
even lovelier .
and according to that very small man ,
you &apos;re also a terrible waitress .
but i had no idea you two were together .
i would have thought a powerful ...
stop . now .
joe , look , we really need these jobs .
we made a bad decision with our bakery business ,
and we have a big bank loan that we can &apos;t pay .
honesty . good .
people respond to honesty .
i don &apos;t , but they do .
max , you have potential here .
caroline , you &apos;re fired as a waitress .
are you sure ?
stop !
there &apos;s nothing in there to save you .
well , if she &apos;s fired , i &apos;m fired , too .
oh , relax , norma rae .
对抗资本家剥削与老板阻拦 成立了公会反抗
she &apos;s fired as a waitress ,
but she &apos;s hired as a hostess .
i am ? why ?
because you &apos;re pretty , you flashed a boob ,
and you took more control of allie in five minutes
than anybody &apos;s been able to do in her three rehab stints .
and that , lady , is a new york city hostess .
well , girls , i struck out .
bill cosby has ruined it for all black men over 70
who are just trying to buy a gal a drink .
max , how do you like that ?
i &apos;m the hostess . i got a promotion !
i don &apos;t think a hostess is a promo--
it is , max , &apos; cause with a less @-@ than @-@ zero bank balance ,
it has to be . it &apos;s all i have left .
