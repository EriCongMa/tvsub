i would never do that .
mom , come on , stop worrying .
this is a safe street . this is a safe building . there &apos;s nothing
oh , my god ! what are you doing in here ? !
mom , i gotta go ! it gotta go !
oh , my god !
that &apos;s fine , you just read the paper .
i &apos;m gonna get a pot .
it &apos;s not for you .
okay , that &apos;s fine .
read the family circus ...
... enjoy the gentle comedy ....
oh , my god , my god , my god , my god ....
it &apos;s open , you guys .
can i help you ?
does phoebe still live here ?
no , she doesn &apos;t . but i can get a message to her .
great . just tell her her husband stopped by .
her what ?
how did you do that ?
the one with phoebe &apos;s husband
this is unbelievable , pheebs . how can you be married ?
i &apos;m not &quot; married &quot; married , you know ?
he &apos;s just a friend , and he &apos;s gay ...
... and he was from canada , and he needed a green card .
i can &apos;t believe you married duncan !
how could you not tell me ? we told each other everything .
i &apos;m sorry , but i knew if i told you , you &apos;d get judgmental ...
... and wouldn &apos;t approve .
of course i wouldn &apos;t approve !
you were totally in love with this guy who , hello , was gay .
what the hell were you thinking ?
see ? and you thought she &apos;d be judgmental .
i wasn &apos;t in love with him . i was helping out a friend .
when he left town , you stayed in your pajamas for a month .
and i saw you eat a cheeseburger .
well , didn &apos;t you ?
i might have .
i can &apos;t believe you didn &apos;t tell me .
like you tell me everything ?
what have i not told you ?
i don &apos;t know .
the fact that the underwear out on the telephone pole is yours ...
... from when you had sex with bobby on the terrace !
what ?
wait a minute ! who told you ?
you are dead meat .
i didn &apos;t know it was a big secret .
oh , it &apos;s not big . not at all .
ikind of the same as , say ...
... i don &apos;t know , having a third nipple !
you have a third nipple ?
you bitch !
whip it out ! whip it out !
there &apos;s nothing to see ! it &apos;s a tiny bump . it &apos;s totally useless .
as opposed to your other multi @-@ functional nipples ?
i can &apos;t believe you ! you told me it was a nubbin .
joey , what did you think a nubbin was ?
you see something , you hear a word , i thought that &apos;s what it was .
let me see it again !
yes , show us your nubbin !
joey was in a porno movie !
if i &apos;m going down , i &apos;m taking everybody with me !
oh , my god !
you were in a porno ? !
i was young and i just wanted a job .
but i couldn &apos;t go through with it .
they let me be the guy who fixes the copier but can &apos;t ...
... because there &apos;s people having sex on it .
that is wild !
what &apos;s it shaped like ?
ls it hairy ?
what happens if you flick it ?
so does it do anything , you know , special ?
pressing my third nipple opens the delivery entrance ...
... to the magical land of narnia .
in some cultures , having a third nipple is actually a sign of virility .
you get the best huts , and women dance naked around you .
are any of these cultures , per chance , in the tri @-@ state area ?
you know , you are so amazing . is there anything you don &apos;t know ?
julie &apos;s so smart ! julie &apos;s so special !
does she put an outfit on at night and go out and fight crime ?
i wanted you to hook up with ross as much as you did .
but he &apos;s with her now . you &apos;ll have to get over it .
oh , i &apos;m going to have to get over it .
i didn &apos;t know that &apos;s what i had to do . i just have to get over it .
i &apos;m gonna have to write that down on my hand .
sassy lady !
where are you going ?
i &apos;m meeting duncan . he &apos;s skating tonight at the garden .
he &apos;s in the capades .
the lce capades ?
no , the gravel capades .
the turns aren &apos;t as fast , but when snoopy falls ? funny .
i can &apos;t believe you &apos;d dress up for him .
you &apos;re setting yourself up all over again .
okay , no .
for your information , i &apos;m seeing him so i can put those feelings behind me .
the reason i &apos;m dressed like this is because i think it &apos;s nice ...
... to look nice for your gay husband .
darn it , we &apos;re all out of milk .
chandler , will you fill me up here ?
i see , i see . because of the third @-@ nipple thing .
okay , sweetie , i &apos;ll see you later .
see you later , rach .
bye @-@ bye , julie .
come on , cut it out !
can i ask you something ?
sure .
what ?
come on , talk to me .
what &apos;s the longest you &apos;ve been in a relationship before ...
... having the sex ?
why ? who &apos;s not ? are you and julie not ?
are you and julie not having sex ?
technically ?
no .
is it because she &apos;s so cold in bed ?
or because she &apos;s kind of bossy , makes it feel like school ?
no ! she &apos;s great . and it &apos;s not like we haven &apos;t done anything .
we do plenty of other stuff . lots of other stuff like
no ! don &apos;t need to know the details .
no , it &apos;s just ....
it &apos;s me .
i &apos;ve only been with one woman my whole life ...
... and she turned out to be a lesbian .
so now i &apos;ve got myself all psyched out .
it &apos;s become , like , this ...
... this thing !
you must just think i &apos;m weird .
no , i don &apos;t think it &apos;s weird .
i think , in fact ....
ln fact , you know what i think ?
what ?
i think it &apos;s sexy .
sexy ?
let me tell you something . as a woman ...
... there is nothing sexier ...
... than a man who does not want to have sex .
no kidding ?
you know what i &apos;d do ?
i &apos;d wait .
you &apos;d wait ?
absolutely . i would wait ...
... and wait ....
then i &apos;d wait some more .
really ?
i don &apos;t care if she tells you she wants it , she begs , she pleads ...
... she tells you she &apos;s gonna have sex with another man
that just means it &apos;s working .
women really want this ?
more than jewelry .
look at you ! you look great !
do l ? thank you .
so do you . sparkly !
this is pretty wonderful , mr. major capades guy !
i remember when you were just king friday in mr. roger &apos;s ice is nice .
you always said i &apos;d make it .
well , you know , i &apos;m kind of spooky that way .
gosh , i missed you !
i &apos;m gonna get changed .
okay .
now .
oh ! right . okay .
ole !
what ?
the matador ....
ole !
sweetie , can you hold this for a second ?
sorry , you had a paleontologist on your face .
but it &apos;s gone now . you &apos;re all right .
hi , everyone .
i wanted to thank you for our little talk before .
no problem ! so you &apos;re gonna go with the waiting thing ?
i was going to , but after i talked to you , i talked to joey .
good . what did he say ?
he told me to get over myself and just do it .
i thought about what you said and about what he said .
and his way , i get to have sex tonight , so ....
what is this in my pocket ?
why , it &apos;s joey &apos;s porno movie !
pop it in !
i &apos;m fine , if you &apos;re okay watching a video ...
... filled with two @-@ nippled people .
people having sex . that &apos;s just what i need to see .
what &apos;s wrong with people having sex ?
well , you know , these movies are offensive ...
... and degrading to women and females ....
and the lighting &apos;s always unflattering .
monica , help me out here .
hell , i wanna see joey !
so is there a story ? or do they just start doing it right
oh . never mind .
wait a minute . that is the craziest typing test i &apos;ve ever seen .
all i say is , she &apos;d better get the job .
looks to me like he &apos;s the one getting the job .
here i come .
see , i &apos;m coming to fix the copier .
i can &apos;t get to the copier . i &apos;m thinking , &quot; what do i do ? &quot;
so i just watch them have sex .
then i say here &apos;s my line !
you know , that &apos;s bad for the paper tray .
nice work , my friend !
wait , you see me again . hang on , the guy &apos;s butt &apos;s blocking me .
there i am . there i am . there i am ....
so what &apos;s up ? you came to see me yesterday .
i kind of need a divorce .
o ... kay .
how come ?
actually , i &apos;m getting married again .
what ?
i don &apos;t know how to tell you this .
i &apos;m straight .
i don &apos;t understand . how can you be straight ?
you &apos;re so smart and funny ...
... and you throw such great academy award parties !
that &apos;s what i kept telling myself .
but you reach a point where you can &apos;t live a lie anymore .
how long have you known ?
i guess on some level i always knew i was straight .
i thought i was supposed to be something else .
i &apos;m an ice dancer , all my friends are gay . i was just trying to fit in .
and there &apos;s actually a woman ?
her name &apos;s debra .
well , is she the first that you &apos;ve been with ?
i &apos;ve never told you this ...
... but there were one or two times back in college when ...
... i &apos;d get drunk , go to a straight bar ...
... and wake up with a woman next to me .
i told myself it was the liquor , and everyone experiments in college .
sure .
now i know i don &apos;t have a choice . i was born this way !
i don &apos;t know what to say .
you &apos;re married to someone for six years and you think you know him .
and then one day he says , &quot; oh , i &apos;m not gay ! &quot;
i &apos;m still me .
why couldn &apos;t you just have figured this out six years ago ?
you know , it still smells like monkey in there .
that saves us the conversation .
this has been great , but i &apos;m officially wiped .
me too . we should get going .
no ! come on , you guys !
come on , it &apos;s only 1.1 : 30 .
let &apos;s just talk . we never just hang out and talk anymore .
rachel , that &apos;s all we do .
maybe that &apos;s all we do . what about julie ?
what about julie ?
you have been in our lives for nearly two months now ...
... and we don &apos;t really know you .
i mean , who is julie ?
what do you like ? what don &apos;t you like ?
we want to know everything .
well , that could take awhile .
so ?
who here does not have the time to get to know julie ?
i got the time to get to know julie .
i know her pretty well . can i go ?
that &apos;s fine .
let &apos;s start with your childhood . what was that like ?
in a nutshell
so , have you told your parents ?
no , but it &apos;ll be okay . they &apos;re pretty cool .
my brother &apos;s straight , so ....
here you go .
you know what ? i just have one more question .
if you had figured this out sooner , and i had been around ...
... do you think l would have been the one ... ?
no . don &apos;t tell me .
i don &apos;t think either answer would make me feel better . here .
i love you , phoebe .
so your brother &apos;s straight , huh ?
seriously .
and my second @-@ grade teacher was miss thomas ...
... and my first @-@ grade teacher was mrs. cobb .
mrs. gobb ?
no , cobb . like cobb salad .
what exactly is in a cobb salad ?
i &apos;m going home .
boy , that julie &apos;s a talker , huh ?
good night .
it &apos;s pretty late . you &apos;re probably not still planning on ....
no , i am .
are you nervous ?
i have done it before .
i mean , how are you gonna handle it ?
are you gonna talk about it beforehand ? are you just gonna pounce ?
i don &apos;t know . i guess i &apos;m just gonna ...
... see what happens .
good luck !
what ?
nothing ....
it is your first time with her , and if the first time doesn &apos;t go well ...
... well then , that &apos;s pretty darn hard to recover from .
okay , now i &apos;m nervous .
maybe you should put it off .
no , i don &apos;t want to put it off !
i spent last year being so unbelievably miserable .
and now i &apos;m actually happy .
you know , i mean really happy .
i just don &apos;t wanna ....
i don &apos;t wanna mess it up , you know ?
i know .
i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s not your fault .
right .
maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be this tough .
maybe you were on the right track with that whole &quot; spontaneous &quot; thing .
women really like that .
really ?
i mean if it were me , i &apos;d want you to ....
i don &apos;t know , catch me off guard with a really ...
... good kiss .
really sort of soft at first .
and then maybe brush the hair away from my face .
and then look far into my eyes ...
... in a way that lets me know something ...
... amazing is about to happen .
and then , i don &apos;t know , then ...
... you &apos;d pull me really close to you so that ...
... so that i &apos;d be pressed up right against you .
and it would get kind of ...
... sweaty ...
... and blurry .
and then it &apos;s just happening .
thanks , rach . good night !
oh , god !
good morning !
well , somebody got some last night !
