we spoke to jude &apos;s therapist .
why isn &apos;t he talking ?
they think it &apos;s something
called selective mutism .
it &apos;s a coping mechanism .
what are we supposed to do then ?
i &apos;m not gonna make a big deal about ...
hey , buddy .
you told emma about haley ?
yes .
why would you tell haley you were a couple and not tell emma ?
that &apos;s none of your business .
this is about you trying to be
like all those other girls .
are you ok ?
not really , no .
i ate a pot brownie and i am freaking out .
it &apos;s ok , you made a mistake .
and tomorrow everything is gonna be back to normal .
no , things will never be normal again .
i slept with dani .
dani ?
i was gonna have sex with wyatt today .
i kinda freaked out . all of the sudden ,
i couldn &apos;t breathe and i just felt like he was gonna crush me .
maybe you were just nervous .
or maybe
i &apos;m still in love with brandon .
i thought you were over him .
yeah , i thought so too .
don &apos;t give up on wyatt .
i &apos;m not .
that was liam . - the foster brother - you told me about ?
he forced me to have sex with him .
that &apos;s not cool , callie . you know that , right ?
that what he did wasn &apos;t cool .
我今天好像看到利亚姆了
did we overdo it with the pink ?
maybe we shoulda gone more gender neutral .
you know , less sugar and spice and everything nice .
hm . no daughter of ours is gonna be everything nice .
speaking of naughty , kids are still asleep .
mmm . not all the kids .
oh , honey , mama &apos;s here .
mama &apos;s here .
yeah . i think she &apos;s hungry .
she &apos;s always hungry .
come here , baby .
you know , she has your lovely long fingers .
and your perfect little flintstone toes .
what &apos;s with all the yelling and the door slamming ?
tell mariana sinking her nose in my business .
i &apos;m sick of you dating about all of my friends .
what friends ?
haley .
you &apos;re dating haley ?
no , no . they &apos;re having sex .
see ? shut up !
don &apos;t tell your sister to shut up .
thank you .
and you , shut up about your brother &apos;s business !
what happened with emma ?
we broke up .
but now , emma wants to get back together
and he didn &apos;t wanna tell her
about haley so he can , like , string her along
or something , so i told her .
are you using condoms ?
mom .
are you ?
yes , of course .
gross .
says the virgin .
ok , enough ! no more door slamming .
mom .
are you ok ?
i &apos;m fine . just got up a little too fast .
do your homework .
hi , dr. hillcroft , it &apos;s lena adams foster .
i &apos;m sorry to call you on your cell but
i just had a headache all day that i can &apos;t shake .
and i was wondering if there was anything i could take ?
so could you call me , please , on my cell or text me ?
thanks .
hey , babe .
hey , where are you ?
well , i was just getting ready to leave here . is everything ok ?
yeah , yeah .
hurry home .
i will .
so how long &apos;s this been going on ?
don &apos;t make it sound like we &apos;re having an affair .
well , something secret is going on here .
ok , look , i went to the halfway house
the night i slipped , ok ?
yeah , i know . a witness saw you .
what do you mean a witness saw me ?
i showed him your picture and he identified you .
you &apos;re investigating me ? !
because you were lying .
and you thought what , stef ?
you had been drinking ...
what , that i killed her ?
... and you had blood on your hands .
he &apos;s been helping me .
i &apos;ve been sober for 60 days now .
it &apos;s the longest since i was 15 .
so you were doing drugs while you were pregnant with the twins ?
that &apos;s a low blow .
why don &apos;t we take this outside .
please .
so , what , mike ? you &apos;re her &quot; sponsor &quot; ? is that it ?
you really think i &apos;m capable of murder ?
don &apos;t turn this around on me .
do you know how many nights i have laid awake ...
i knew you wouldn &apos;t approve ...
i don &apos;t approve .
that woman has lied , and threatened ,
and manipulated my family .
she almost landed you in jail .
she used our son to try and extort us , mike .
yes . she &apos;s done horrible things , because she &apos;s sick .
i don &apos;t expect you to understand , you &apos;re not an addict .
but she &apos;s not a terrible person .
who &apos;s paying for this ?
i am but just until she can get a job ...
i can &apos;t believe how foolish you &apos;re being .
you could be charged with witness tampering ...
she &apos;s not gonna go to the da .
i want no part of this .
good . then stop following me and mind your own business .
hey , baby , what &apos;s going on ?
brandon just took mama to the emergency room .
what ? why ?
she fainted and she was throwing up .
what er ?
sacred cross .
i &apos;m on my way .
140 over 90 .
which is good .
it hasn &apos;t risen .
it hasn &apos;t gone down either .
ok .
eight glasses a day , please .
are you sure you don &apos;t want me to call your mother ?
no . i &apos;m supposed to avoid stress ,
not invite it for the weekend .
maybe i should call the doctor .
mm . no . don &apos;t be the boy who cried wolf , please .
if the medication isn &apos;t working ...
as long as it doesn &apos;t go any higher ,
the doctor said there &apos;s nothing to worry about .
well , i wouldn &apos;t say nothing .
am i driving you crazy ?
a little bit .
ok .
honey , i love you for taking such good care of me
but you gotta get out of the house .
go for a run . go run an errand .
go get me a veggie burger from viv &apos;s .
ok , all right . if you need anything use this .
i got it from the earthquake kit .
seriously ?
i don &apos;t want you having to yell for us .
i ... don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on with her .
things were really good and then she , like , suddenly pulled away .
and she &apos;s not talking to me , really .
she just keeps saying everything &apos;s fine but i know it &apos;s not .
i &apos;m not really sure what to say .
is she still hung up on you ? i mean ... are you guys ... ?
we &apos;re brother and sister .
not yet .
look , we &apos;re not friends .
and i can &apos;t be your couples counselor .
that &apos;s not what i &apos;m asking .
what are you asking ?
for a little help ?
i already helped .
i got out of your way .
look , nobody gave me a guide to understanding callie . ok ?
if that &apos;s even possible .
so ...
i don &apos;t know , maybe you need to give her some space .
that &apos;s all i got .
thanks for the advice .
hi , i &apos;m brian . these are my parents .
we &apos;re here to see the bed .
i got this . i &apos;m jesus .
hey , i &apos;m selling mom &apos;s bed .
the one she &apos;s lying in right now ?
you can &apos;t .
they asked me to .
what &apos;s in it for you ?
ten percent .
mom , i forgot i had people coming to see the bed today .
should you be up ?
i &apos;m supposed to stretch my legs .
and , yeah , it &apos;s fine to show the bed .
well , why does he get to sell the bed ?
why don &apos;t you two just work together .
this girl couldn &apos;t sell a dollar for fifty cents .
uh , the 1950 &apos;s called , they want their joke back .
so is now a good time ?
my mom was wondering how long you &apos;ve had the bed .
less than six months , it &apos;s practically new .
it has a 20 year transferable warranty .
and it &apos;s retailed at $ 6,000 .
for 2,500 , this is a steal .
are you clean ?
like , hygienic ?
my moms shower before bed every night .
my mom wants to know if you have a husband ?
yes , but he &apos;s not home right now . he &apos;s working .
i have a wife and ...
the bed was a wedding gift but it doesn &apos;t suit us .
they &apos;re lesbians .
is that a problem ?
it &apos;s not a problem .
great .
why don &apos;t we let the kims
discuss this privately for a few minutes ?
thank you .
i just want to let you know
there &apos;s a lot of interest in this bed .
you &apos;re the first people to see it today .
so i &apos;d act fast .
今天能见面吗
hey , you wanna help ?
thought i &apos;d do some planting for lena .
she &apos;s been so busy at school and now with the baby ...
everything &apos;s gonna be fine , it &apos;s just a drag , to be on bed rest .
just plant these ones in rows about , like , six inches apart , ok ?
you know ...
you &apos;ve always been so good .
you always held it together . you never lost it .
no matter what bad stuff happened to us .
you &apos;re due for a breakdown .
so , don &apos;t let me
or anyone else make you feel like you have to talk .
until you &apos;re ready .
it &apos;s ok .
ok , special delivery for the sexiest pregnant woman in ...
hi .
uh , hello .
i &apos;m brian . those are my parents
and they &apos;re interested in the bed .
actually , my mom is interested but my dad doesn &apos;t like it .
would you be willing to sell half the bed ?
in case you change your mind about splitting the bed .
if someone else wants half , we &apos;ll call you .
what ?
way to close the deal .
i &apos;m not selling half a bed .
i &apos;m surprised you didn &apos;t just string them along .
just in case you couldn &apos;t decide .
don &apos;t go there .
and by the way , i &apos;m still a virgin
because i want to be , not because i have to be .
mat . you know jesus and my sister , the virgin mariana .
139 over 80 .
see ? the medication is working .
yeah , i didn &apos;t doubt it for a minute .
but you still have to stay right here and rest .
not letting anymore strangers up here to see the bed today .
i &apos;m fine . and we have to get rid of this thing .
especially before the baby comes .
we don &apos;t want her falling into the crack .
oh , so we &apos;re co @-@ sleeping , are we ?
i kinda think it &apos;d be nice , you know ?
i &apos;ve been reading about attachment parenting ...
yeah , well , you know ,
people have been known to roll over on their babies .
we &apos;re not heavy drinkers or sleepers .
i &apos;m just saying , it &apos;s not recommended .
can you imagine coming out of the comfort and warmth of the womb
and then being left in a crib all alone ?
that &apos;s what a swaddle &apos;s for .
brandon slept in a crib and he has turned out just fine .
hey , mike and dani are here .
ok . stay . rest . you .
so just heat on 350 for about 30 minutes .
ok , thanks . i appreciate it .
all dani &apos;s idea .
yeah ?
with lena on bed rest ,
i don &apos;t want you to have to cook .
is this like serious ?
not if they get it under control ,
but she may be on bed rest for a while .
is she up for visitors ?
yeah , i think so .
hey . what &apos;re you doing here ?
dani made us dinner . isn &apos;t that nice of her ?
yeah .
we &apos;re just going up and say hi to lena .
is that a good idea ? i mean , she barely knows dani .
brandon .
no . he &apos;s right .
you should just go , mike .
you sure ?
yeah . i have to make the salad anyway .
ok . i &apos;ll be right back .
um , can i get a salad bowl ?
yeah , brandon , will you grab her a salad bowl , please ?
yep .
thanks .
how you doing ?
much better . thank you .
good . i heard you &apos;re having a girl .
yeah .
i &apos;m really happy for you . both .
that means a lot .
you know , dani and i are talking about having a baby .
really ?
yeah , she &apos;s younger than me and wants kids .
and i don &apos;t know , i wouldn &apos;t mind getting another chance .
maybe do a better job of it this time .
mike , you &apos;re a really good father .
i made a lot of mistakes .
everybody makes mistakes .
brandon , um , he loves you very much .
he &apos;s made mistakes too .
but he &apos;s back on the right track now .
right ?
i should let you rest .
dani just wanted to drop off her special lasagna for you guys .
mike .
yeah ?
thank you .
thank dani , she did all the cooking .
please , thank her for me .
i will .
your dad is talking about having a baby with dani .
i need you to know why i &apos;m helping ana .
i know why .
no , you don &apos;t .
i went to the halfway house twice that night .
first , to threaten ana .
and then , after i drank again ...
... i went back , to shut her up .
for good .
yelling at her didn &apos;t make me feel any better .
she still had all the power to destroy my career , maybe yours .
but worst of all , to hurt our son .
i was disgusted with myself .
at least brandon did something to try to make her go away .
to protect our family . what was i doing ? nothing .
so i went back . i parked outside .
with a bottle and i waited .
and the next thing i remember was dani found me passed out
in my car in some parking lot somewhere with blood on my hands .
mike ...
then ...
when i found out ana went missing that night ...
i had to find out what happened ,
even if it meant i &apos;d done something terrible .
thank god , i found her alive ,
strung out in some crack house .
i was so relieved , that i vowed to myself and to god
that i would do anything i could to help her .
to get her on her feet and get sober .
because in my heart , i did want to kill her that night .
and that &apos;s a sin i need to make amends for , stef .
and knowing that alcohol put me in that state of mind
is why i &apos;ll never have another drink ever again .
hey , all done ?
yep . salad &apos;s in the fridge .
thank you .
hey , let us know if you need anything else .
will do .
hey .
oh . i didn &apos;t know you were still here .
what &apos;s that ?
geometry .
are you like a mathlete or something ?
i &apos;m on the dance team .
which makes you better than a mathlete ?
no .
hey , why do you dye your hair ?
none of your business .
don &apos;t move .
指受了委屈 好斗 爱吵架的人
what ?
there &apos;s a chip on your shoulder .
i do not have a chip on my shoulder .
are you a good dancer ?
i don &apos;t know . i mean , i &apos;m ok .
i &apos;m not the best .
why not ?
i &apos;m just ...
lazy ?
i work harder than anyone on that dance team .
see ?
what ?
the not a chip thing .
ok , i really need to do my homework .
do you want to go out sometime ?
with you ?
yeah .
alone , with you ?
are you afraid to be alone with me ?
no .
so ?
could you be more specific ?
friday night ?
ok .
ok .
sir . can i ask you what you &apos;re doing ?
looking for signs of urine , semen , or blood
not visible to the human eye .
hey . there are more people here to see the bed .
get them some water or something .
no . i &apos;m not your assistant .
i can &apos;t leave all these strangers alone in our house .
that &apos;s your problem .
look , i &apos;ll cut you in .
like , ten percent of my ten percent .
twenty @-@ five dollars ? get real .
twenty @-@ five percent .
half .
no way .
all right , have fun .
hope nobody steals anything .
fine , fine . forty / sixty .
deal .
hello ?
how many amps is this motor ?
hello .
do you live here ?
uh , yeah .
how much do you want for the kitchen table ?
oh , hey . they &apos;re here to see the bed .
it &apos;ll just be a few more minutes .
yeah , and the kitchen table &apos;s not for sale .
well , how much are you willing to pay for it ?
what ?
you know that we haven &apos;t talked about baby names .
i was kinda thinking we could
name her after your dad .
frank ? that &apos;s a good way to scar her for the rest of her life .
francesca ,
and we could call her frankie .
seriously ?
yeah .
what do you think ?
i think i love it .
so ...
there &apos;s something i need to tell you .
what about ?
brandon .
i was just working on a new song .
can you come sit please ?
yeah .
mama told me what happened .
she did ?
uh , what did she tell you ?
that you got high .
you did the right thing , calling one of us .
i &apos;m assuming that you got the pot from one of your band mates ?
i &apos;m never going to do it again .
i probably should have warned you . we &apos;re not exactly pot people .
of course nobody should be .
but , i freaked out when i tried it too .
being in a band doesn &apos;t mean you have to act like a rock star .
that goes for alcohol , too .
ok .
i &apos;m very happy that you &apos;re playing music again
but if being in this band affects your grades
or your judgment again , you &apos;re done .
yeah . i get it .
i don &apos;t like having to be the hard ass , brandon .
don &apos;t .
why do you have to be ?
because someone has to .
you &apos;ll understand one day when you have kids of your own .
i can &apos;t believe i just said that .
dinner &apos;s in thirty minutes , ok ?
you know , it also has a massage setting .
and memory foam so it contours to your body .
well then , why are you selling it ?
it &apos;s too big . it takes up the whole room .
well , i don &apos;t believe my bedroom &apos;s any bigger than this .
maybe it &apos;s too big for me too .
it &apos;s not too big , it &apos;s just , it &apos;s not good for ... intimacy ,
because of the split between the beds .
that &apos;s why we &apos;re selling it .
oh ... well , that &apos;s no issue .
at my age , the less intimacy the better .
then this is the bed for you , i think .
oh , i hear a little squeaking sound .
probably needs some maintenance .
i don &apos;t hear anything .
you know , it &apos;s illegal to sell a used bed .
not privately .
and she would know , she &apos;s a cop .
ah . the fuzz , eh ?
well , it &apos;s not worth it but i &apos;ll give you $ 500 bucks .
we &apos;re asking for twenty @-@ five hundred .
and it sells for twice that new !
but it &apos;s not new , it &apos;s used and it squeaks .
it doesn &apos;t squeak .
fifteen hundred .
mom , we can get more for it .
seven @-@ fifty .
twelve @-@ fifty .
please .
one thousand , my last offer .
sold .
hey , you just made a hundred dollars .
sixty .
演唱者 drew holcomb and the neighbors
it &apos;s been so long since you &apos;ve all gotten in bed with us .
this is nice .
which reminds me , we have to go shopping for a new mattress
tomorrow after your doctor &apos;s appointment ...
yes .
... see if we can get same day delivery .
or , i guess , i &apos;m sleeping on the floor tomorrow night ?
&apos;fraid so .
just make sure that old bag pays you in cash .
hey , hey , hey . language , please .
what time &apos;s your appointment tomorrow ?
nine a.m.
will you let us know what she says ?
i will text you immediately .
where are you going to put the baby &apos;s crib ?
we were thinking right here , by the window .
b , you &apos;re awfully quiet tonight .
he &apos;s not as quiet as jude is .
i &apos;m just kidding .
i do miss your sweet , sweet voice .
now , shut up and roll .
park place . pay me , sucka !
and there &apos;s a hotel . you are in big trouble , bud .
my turn .
all right .
what &apos;s going on ?
i don &apos;t understand how this can happen overnight , literally .
preeclampsia can go from mild to severe very quickly .
well , there must be another medication .
there &apos;s protein in your urine and
your blood pressure is dangerously high and rising .
at this point , all we can do
is deliver the baby and the placenta as soon as possible .
but the baby &apos;s only 20 weeks .
how many weeks does she have to be ?
the earliest a premie can survive is 24 weeks
and even then there &apos;s only a 35 % chance .
then we wait ... another six to eight weeks . whatever it takes .
it &apos;s not just about the baby .
you could have a stroke , or impaired liver or kidney function .
it &apos;s maternal mortality that &apos;s the risk here .
ok . but this is all just worse case scenario stuff .
i could still respond to the blood pressure medication ,
i can stay here in the hospital , i can stay on bed rest .
there &apos;s still a chance , right ?
one i wouldn &apos;t recommend taking .
i &apos;ll leave you to talk .
i &apos;m gonna be right back , ok ?
excuse me . what are we gonna do ?
we can &apos;t make her deliver against her will .
even if she could die ?
legally , we have to respect her wishes .
but she &apos;s isn &apos;t in crisis yet .
i know it &apos;s scary ,
but let &apos;s give her a little time to process this .
ok ?
yeah . thank you .
come here .
演唱者 ingrid michaelson
i saw her , in a dream .
she was in our bed with us
and she was beautiful and she was healthy .
i can feel her inside me .
i have faith .
even if it takes a miracle .
she &apos;s gonna be all right , she &apos;s going to make it .
i don &apos;t have faith .
that &apos;s ok . because i have enough for the both of us .
so ... mama &apos;s gonna be all right .
what about the baby ?
um ... it doesn &apos;t look good .
so what can we do ?
you can support mama .
and love her .
ok ?
grandma &apos;s here .
it &apos;s ok .
it &apos;s all right , baby .
it &apos;s ok .
is lena ok ?
grandma &apos;s still in with her .
i feel so sad .
yeah , me too .
you should call wyatt .
why ?
he &apos;s your boyfriend , right ?
right .
i met him yesterday .
you ran into wyatt ?
he asked to meet . to talk . about you .
why ? what did he say ?
just that things were good and then something happened .
did he say what ?
no .
he was just wondering ...
... if it had to do with me .
we tried to have sex .
i freaked out . i had like ... a panic attack .
at first , i did think ...
maybe i wasn &apos;t over you .
but , then i realized ...
is it because of liam ?
why don &apos;t you just tell wyatt .
because , i don &apos;t want to .
and i really wish he hadn &apos;t involved you .
well , me too .
but ...
i know how it feels to love you
and not know why you &apos;re pulling away .
it &apos;s a lonely place to be .
and frankly , it &apos;s not ok .
i really don &apos;t want to talk about this .
of course you don &apos;t .
but you never want to talk about things that are hard .
but keeping stuff inside doesn &apos;t make it hurt less .
you just hurt the people you shut out .
we should get back inside .
i know that this sounds so selfish ,
but everyone in the house is connected to somebody by blood .
i know that you don &apos;t need that to be a family , i know that .
but sometimes i &apos;m afraid that ...
... they won &apos;t love me as much as i love them
because i &apos;m not their biological mom .
that they won &apos;t have that to tether them to me ,
when i &apos;m driving them crazy or i won &apos;t give them what they want .
or i fail them .
that they &apos;ll just ...
that they &apos;ll look at me and they &apos;ll say ,
&quot; you &apos;re not my real mom . &quot;
and walk away .
honey , to be honest ,
every mother &apos;s afraid that
our children won &apos;t love us the way we love them .
and they won &apos;t . not in the same way .
biology or not .
that &apos;s the way it &apos;s supposed to be .
mothers and fathers , we have to love our children more ...
... in order to make the sacrifices
it takes to put them first .
but one thing is true .
love will always be a stronger bond than blood .
trust that .
and those children out there love you .
they need you .
they can &apos;t lose you .
their needs trump your wants .
and that &apos;s what being a real mother is all about .
hey , mom . i &apos;ve been thinking ...
i want you to keep the commission on the bed , ok ?
i &apos;m sorry .
i love you , baby .
i know you &apos;re angry we don &apos;t have the same birth father .
and that i have a half @-@ sister and that i wanted to meet her .
and i know you &apos;re angry that we couldn &apos;t get adopted together .
and you don &apos;t feel like you have any say over anything .
but you do . when it comes to me , you do .
i won &apos;t ever see sophia again if it hurts you .
and there is nothing you can ever say to me
that &apos;s gonna make me run away again .
but you have to talk to me .
and to the people who love you .
you can &apos;t shut us out .
it &apos;s selfish . and you &apos;re not selfish .
ok .
so , is lena going to be ok ?
yeah , for now .
but she lost the baby so ...
that &apos;s so sad .
i &apos;m really sorry .
we all are .
i &apos;m also sorry ...
that i haven &apos;t told you why i couldn &apos;t ...
i was raped .
was it that guy , who ...
yeah . yeah .
i thought i put it behind me .
but it turns out i ...
still have some stuff i have to work through .
so i &apos;m gonna need some space to do that .
ok .
take as long as you need .
all i ever ask from you is this ...
is to talk to me .
