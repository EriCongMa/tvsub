* sweet home waimanalo *
* where the skies are so blue *
* sweet home waimanalo *
* sang min &apos;s coming home to you *
what , no flowers ?
where do i sign for him ?
right here .
come on , girl . i came all the way
from a haole prison on the mainland
to snitch for you .
no in @-@ flight movie , no meal service .
least you can do is , uh , show me some love .
let &apos;s get a couple of things straight .
one , don &apos;t call me girl . you can address me as
officer kalakaua or don &apos;t address me at all .
two , this is not a vacation . you &apos;re here to testify
at a federal trial in exchange for
a sentence reduction .
so , please , don &apos;t pretend you &apos;re doing me any favors .
&apos;cause , trust me , there are plenty of things
i &apos;d rather be doing than babysitting your ass
for the next 24 hours .
i get it . so you want to hit the shrimp truck
before we check into the hotel ?
get in the car .
still spicy .
max got an i.d. yet ?
no , he &apos;s still fishing out body parts .
i think he &apos;s enjoying it , too .
i can &apos;t believe that was a person .
crispy .
um , i told you my nephew
was maybe gonna come visit from jersey .
well , that happened . here he is .
what &apos;s up , bro ? call me e @-@ train .
put your hand down , okay ?
that &apos;s not your bro , your name &apos;s eric .
please go wait in the car like i asked you to , okay ?
can i at least have the keys ? you didn &apos;t even crack a window .
then wait outside . anywhere but my crime scene .
okay ? please ?
come on .
don &apos;t look at me like that , just go .
yo , how you doin &apos; , sweetheart ?
okay , so your nephew visits from jersey ,
and you , uh , bring him on a homicide call ?
that &apos;s ... yep .
okay . just a hunch , but do you think maybe
he would &apos;ve enjoyed the beach a little more ?
yeah , he &apos;s lucky he &apos;s not locked up .
okay , couple months ago he gets popped in a stolen car .
make a couple phone calls , get the charges dropped .
my sister &apos;s worried sick , does not know what to do with him .
so she send him to me , maybe i can , i don &apos;t know ,
scare some sense into him .
how &apos;s that working out ?
he just saw his first dead body
and he &apos;s still acting like a complete idiot
so , i guess i have my work cut out for me .
right . what do we know ?
okay , according to max , guy was dead
before he hit the tub .
well , if the acid bath didn &apos;t kill him , what did ?
blunt force trauma to the head .
we also got signs of forced entry ,
and ... a bunch of stolen lab gear .
we got , uh , bioreactor , particle protector ,
couple of laser microscopes .
you know , bunch of other stuff i &apos;ve never heard of .
all right , so the vic was in here when the robbery went down .
yeah . wrong place , wrong time .
guy gets bonked in the head
and then turned into human soup .
that &apos;s smart .
get rid of any evidence on the body
they could trace back , right ?
guy &apos;s stealing fancy microscopes ,
probably know a thing or two about dna .
okay , things just got interesting .
hpd found the stolen lab gear in a dumpster
three blocks from here .
i &apos;m thinking this was a murder staged to look like a robbery .
csu just finished processing the point of entry
and determined the door was broken from the inside .
okay , so the killer had access to this place
but did not want us to know that .
mm @-@ hmm , and according to campus security ,
there are over 300 students and faculty members
with keycard access to this lab .
then every one of them is a suspect .
this is a huge blow to the university .
professor cutler wasn &apos;t just a brilliant educator
and researcher-- he was ohana ,
a member of the o &apos;ahu state family .
okay , well someone in his ohana wanted him dead .
we &apos;ve determined that the robbery was staged .
what ?
professor cutler was killed
by somebody who had access to the lab .
who would &apos;ve wanted to do something like that ?
well , mr. roth , you &apos;re chairman of the department .
we were hoping you could tell us .
there you go .
list of every student and faculty member with lab access .
thanks . so did professor cutler use the lab often ?
i &apos;d say so . once these guys get published ,
half their time is spent writing and researching .
then it falls on teaching assistants like me
to pick up the slack in the classroom .
bram , do you know what he was working on in the lab last night ?
no . been spending a lot of late nights there .
keeping weird hours .
but then there &apos;s a lot about the professor &apos;s behavior
that seemed odd lately .
really ? how so ?
well , he started missing lectures .
when he did show up , he seemed distracted .
i asked him if everything was okay ,
and he told me to mind my own business .
there was one incident a couple of days ago ,
but i &apos;m quite certain it was nothing .
why don &apos;t you let us make that call ?
i heard yelling .
when i looked outside , i saw a student
storming out of joel &apos;s office .
she was crying and she seemed very upset .
does this student have a name ?
i &apos;m sure she does , but i don &apos;t know what it is .
all i can tell you is she was about five @-@ two
with brown hair and dark colored eyes .
did the professor say what the argument was about ?
joel was a very private person .
i never asked him about his personal life .
whoa , whoa , a female student comes out of his office
with tears in her eyes-- how &apos;s that a personal matter ?
wait a minute , i never meant to insinuate ...
you just did .
look , your friend is dead ,
so why don &apos;t you stop trying to protect him .
if you know something , you need to tell us .
right now .
joel had a way of connecting with his students ;
making complex ideas understandable .
intellect like that can be very alluring to a young woman .
you should &apos;ve seen the way they looked at him .
he ever cross the line ?
i have my suspicions .
but if i had found out that he was sleeping with a student ,
i would have had to fire him .
that &apos;s why i just never asked .
* unskinny bop , just blows me away *
* unskinny bop *
* all night and day *
* unskinny bop , bop , bop *
* she just loves to play *
* unskinny bop , got nothin &apos; more to say ... *
you got to be kidding .
aloha , mrs. min .
your husband wanted to surprise you with a late lunch .
consider me surprised .
what kind of two @-@ star dump you putting me up in here ?
bathroom doesn &apos;t even have a flat iron .
about time . i &apos;m starving .
all right , first of all , cross your legs .
okay , second of all , i don &apos;t know how
excuse me , brotha .
you managed this ,
but i am not signing for this food .
you tell &apos; em , sister .
bruddah , you call these jumbo shrimp ?
they &apos;re small , they &apos;re rubbery ,
and they got no flavor .
i &apos;m sorry , ma &apos;am .
i can &apos;t take the food back now .
okay , if it &apos;s that bad , why are you still eating it ?
and a better question is ,
what the hell are you doing here ?
sang called me from the joint .
said he needed some fresh threads for his court date . check it out .
check those lapels , huh ?
tony montana style .
made to measure , brah .
my tailor is the best on the island .
i don &apos;t buy nothing off the rack no more .
i &apos;m sure you don &apos;t .
oh , you think this is funny ?
yesterday , you were sitting in a supermax in virginia
&apos;cause half the bad guys on this island wanted you dead .
and now , you &apos;re back .
and there are some very dangerous people
who do not want you testifying tomorrow .
so , i &apos;d quit treating this place
like a hospitality suite .
okay , i &apos;m just curious .
how many people did you invite ?
i &apos;m not expecting no one else .
oh , thank god .
jason parker from the office of the prosecuting attorney .
i &apos;m here to prep the witness for his testimony tomorrow .
officer decker here will relieve you of duty while we prepare .
he &apos;s all yours .
this is where you work ?
yeah .
not bad .
oh , bitchin &apos; computer .
no , hey ...
you got minesweeper on this thing ?
ho , ho , hey . stop . stop . stop .
please , go wait in my office , okay ?
what am i supposed to do in there ?
i don &apos;t know .
why don &apos;t you go meditate on the poor life decisions you &apos;ve made ,
maybe think about how you can turn it all around .
please .
okay .
it &apos;s like , uh , house @-@ training a puppy .
i mean , the kid has zero impulse control .
guys , i got a voice mail
you need to hear .
this came through on professor cutler &apos;s cell phone two days ago .
you can &apos;t do this to me .
if you keep ignoring me ,
there will be consequences .
as far as threats go , that &apos;s not subtle .
we identify the caller ?
yeah , number came back to a rebecca fine .
she &apos;s a senior in cutler &apos;s advanced chem class .
five foot two , brown hair , brown eyes .
matches the description of the student
that was seen leaving cutler &apos;s office in tears .
mm @-@ hmm , and she had access to the lab .
according to cutler &apos;s teaching assistant ,
he had been spending a lot of late hours there .
okay , okay , let me take a stab at this .
so , cutler is getting cute with , uh , young rebecca here .
uh , they &apos;re using the lab for , um , late @-@ night hookups .
relationship goes south , he tries to end it
and rebecca kills him .
i like it .
let &apos;s see what rebecca &apos;s got to say about it .
now @-@ now , this ...
now , this is the best thing i &apos;ve ever seen .
what ?
thank you .
what ? what is it ?
oh , it &apos;s our own danny williams .
oh . as mr. november in the 1998
newark police academy calendar .
look at you , buddy .
i was young , this was for charity .
where did you get this ?
uh , i believe you just e @-@ mailed it to me .
no , i didn &apos;t .
yeah , you just e @-@ mailed it to me , too .
and , it looks like you e @-@ mailed it
to everybody in your address book .
get up .
stand up .
stand up , stand up .
do you think that is funny ?
you know grace is on that e @-@ mail ?
oh ... my bad , man .
i know how scarring it could be for a kid to see that photo .
your calendar hung in our kitchen for years .
mom thought it was the biggest deal when you became a cop .
oh , that &apos;s good .
well , at least somebody in the family is making her proud , right ?
that &apos;s low , dude .
oh , it &apos;s low ? suck it up , okay ?
while you are-- look at me when i &apos;m talking to you--
while you are here ,
you are going to be living
in what is called the real world .
that means , you act like an idiot ,
and i am gonna call you out .
now , you can go back to new jersey ,
and you can continue to waste away your life .
or , you can stay here
and you can maybe learn something .
it &apos;s your choice .
but please know ,
please know that unlike your mother ,
i am not a pushover , okay ?
you pull another stunt like that again ,
and i am not going to be as courteous as i am being right now , you dig ?
yeah .
ready ?
let &apos;s go , i got a case to work .
let &apos;s go . you &apos;re gonna like this , i promise .
i need to rethink my decision to skip college .
easy , there , tiger .
kelly , your dads are here to pick you up .
those aren &apos;t my dads .
i &apos;m sorry .
you think i look old enough to be her father ?
that &apos;s the ... that &apos;s the part you bumped on ?
you were right .
this is definitely worth coming for .
okay , excuse me .
we &apos;re looking for rebecca fine .
is she here ?
yeah .
becky &apos;s room &apos;s upstairs .
second door on the right .
all right , thank you .
you guys go ahead , i don &apos;t want to ...
get in your way .
okay . behave yourself , please .
yup .
how you doing , baby doll ? what &apos;s going on ?
go away !
rebecca , this is commander mcgarrett
of five @-@ o.
open the door .
one second .
i &apos;m just getting changed .
you buying that ?
no .
window .
rebecca , stop !
well , this is definitely your first .
how do you want to play it ?
shoot her tires out .
you don &apos;t get a vote .
rebecca , pull over .
no .
please ?
no !
okay , that didn &apos;t work .
you guys are making a huge mistake .
my dad &apos;s a big @-@ time lawyer .
he &apos;s gonna own this entire building
by the time he &apos;s through with you .
hmm . how do you ... how do you figure that ?
this is textbook police harassment .
you can &apos;t just arrest someone
and then keep them in a dungeon for no reason .
you can &apos;t do this to me .
if you keep ignoring me , there will be consequences .
so , we got a witness who saw you
storming out of joe cutler &apos;s office in tears .
the next day , you leave this message .
day after that , he &apos;s dead .
this is crazy , because i didn &apos;t kill him .
really ? then why &apos;d you run when we came to look for you ?
i &apos;m not saying anything else without my lawyer .
you mean , uh , your daddy , right ?
excuse me , guys .
rebecca fine ...
i believe this is yours .
see , after your arrest , hpd showed up to search your room
and it was flooded .
it seems that the toilet got clogged
when you tried to flush your stash .
so , that &apos;s why you ran .
you have no idea the pressure i &apos;m under .
midterms are this week ,
and i have been up for days studying .
i just ... i needed a little boost ,
so i bought some prescription uppers off of a friend .
it was the only way i could keep up with all the cheaters .
cheaters ? what are you talking about ?
kids in my advanced chem class are cheating .
someone &apos;s been selling them the exams .
that &apos;s why i went to go see professor cutler .
and why i left him that message .
i was just trying to get him to do something about it .
but he ignored you , is that right ?
he said he &apos;d look into it ,
but he couldn &apos;t do anything unless there was proof .
then he told me to focus on acing the midterm ,
totally disregarding that
the class is graded on a curve
and the cheaters were dragging my grade down .
i mean , this is my future we &apos;re talking about .
do you know how much of an impact even a few tenths of a gpa point
can have on your ability to get into med school ?
i have no idea . tell me .
it &apos;s the difference between johns hopkins and ...
a state school .
oh , horrible .
got it .
hey . that was max .
he just finished autopsying cutler &apos;s body .
based on the skull fractures ,
to inflict that kind of damage ,
he &apos;s saying the killer had to have been at least 190 pounds .
okay , rebecca is definitely not our killer .
and this cheating business changes everything .
if cutler was looking into it , maybe one of his students
killed him to avoid being expelled .
wow , i mean , college is a lot more cutthroat than i remember .
i just talked to fong .
he found spyware on cutler &apos;s work computer .
it was used to pull a bunch of files off the hard drive .
okay , well , that would explain
how the seller got his hands on the exams .
fong know who hacked the computer ?
no .
that &apos;s a dead end , the spyware was untraceable .
okay , we need to find a kid that &apos;s cheating
and roll him to get the name of the guy who sold the exam .
want to know who &apos;s cheating ?
what &apos;d you do ?
did you get some scoop from the sorority girls ?
no .
i was just gonna say , you could check the transcripts .
see whose grades spiked the most .
chances are , they &apos;re cheating .
kid &apos;s got a point .
i &apos;ll wait out here .
this is , uh , college .
it &apos;s not a virus , you cannot catch it .
go .
okay .
tyler brown , come on down .
let &apos;s go .
all right , stop .
i &apos;m in the middle of writing a midterm , what &apos;s this about ?
what &apos;s this about ?
i &apos;ll tell you what it &apos;s about ,
it &apos;s about your grades .
all right , one day , you &apos;re about to drop out of this place ,
the next day you &apos;re gunning for the dean &apos;s list .
what &apos;s your secret ?
just started applying myself , i guess .
oh , yeah ?
well .. whoa , what are you doing ?
you need a nickel that bad , i &apos;ll lend you one , okay ?
your boy here chucked this can on the way out .
look at this .
drinks . one of the few things you can take into a test .
see , you mock up a fake label with an answer key on it ,
no one looks twice .
that &apos;s good .
nice catch , e @-@ train .
thanks .
please , steve .
look at that .
okay , dopey , who &apos;d you buy the exam from ?
i think my ribs are broken .
yeah ?
well , next time a cop calls your name , don &apos;t run .
seriously ... it hurts when i breathe .
then breathe less .
come on , get up . turn around .
a little excessive , don &apos;t you think , guys ?
i mean , all i did was sell some exams .
oh , you forgot about the part where you brained your boss
and dumped him into an acid bath .
what ? you guys think i killed professor cutler ?
yes , we do .
no . look , i &apos;ll admit ,
cutler was not my favorite person .
i mean , he was so wrapped up in his research ,
i was basically teaching the class for him .
i gave his lectures , graded the papers and exams ,
i figured for all that extra work .
i was due some compensation .
right . so , you hacked his computer for the exams .
he finds out you &apos;re selling them , then you kill him .
no , i didn &apos;t kill him .
and i certainly didn &apos;t hack his computer ,
because i wrote all those exams myself .
cutler was so checked out ,
he never even asked to see them .
all right , thank you .
t.a. &apos; s story checks out .
got three other faculty members vouching for the fact
that he did write the exams for the class .
well , that means cutler &apos;s computer was
hacked for something else .
yeah , but for what ?
i mean , he &apos;s skipping class ,
he &apos;s spending late nights in the lab ,
and we got no evidence of this so @-@ called research project
that he &apos;s been working on .
maybe he was hiding it .
what do you mean ?
i mean , if he knew there was spyware on his computer ,
he probably started being careful .
maybe he didn &apos;t keep his work at the office .
nah , hpd already checked the house ,
and they came up with nothing .
i don &apos;t mean to besmirch the good people
of the honolulu police department ,
but it is possible they missed something .
&quot; besmirch &quot; ?
yeah . i &apos;m just saying , hypothetically speaking ,
if i was hiding something in my mother &apos;s house ...
... which i am not ...
... i &apos;d make sure the cops
had to tear the place apart to find it .
... and i &apos;m no chemistry genius .
kid &apos;s been on a roll , lately .
might be worth a second look .
fine . fine , but you &apos;re still waiting in the car .
what else is new ?
you hear that ?
yeah , danny , i hear it . i have ears .
it &apos;s a reasonable question .
it &apos;s coming from behind this bookcase .
lock &apos;s busted .
hydroponic grow room .
lights are on timers .
they must have been off when hpd did their sweep .
that &apos;s why they didn &apos;t hear it .
okay , um , been my experience here ,
but i think the grow room usually means one thing , no ?
yeah , but this isn &apos;t marijuana . i can see that .
what is it ?
i don &apos;t know .
whatever it is , is was worth killing for .
and of course , this is charlie .
he uses science to provide our investigations
with new and helpful leads .
just like he &apos;s about to do now . right , charlie ?
that &apos;s the idea .
oh , sweet thermal cycler , dude .
how do you know what that is ?
discovery channel .
that &apos;s weird .
dna analysis matched the sample to
a species called kawaihae hibiscadelphus .
what &apos;s so weird about it ?
well , what &apos;s weird is , it &apos;s been thought
to be extinct for about 200 years .
which means your victim either found a very rare specimen ,
or he brought it back to life .
it &apos;s pretty cool , right ?
i don &apos;t understand it .
how did our vic get his hands on an extinct plant ?
we don &apos;t know yet , but the real question is ,
why did it get him killed ?
anyway , how are things going on your end ?
i &apos;m back at the room now .
i just have to get sang min to court in the morning .
then i ship his greasy mullet back to the mainland .
all right , hang in there , cuz .
what happened ?
sneaky bastard blindsided us . he &apos;s gone .
i think i d founout
how our victim got a hold of that plant .
i combed through cutler &apos;s financials , and over the past six months ,
he &apos;s been booking regular hunting trips .
now , the thing about that is ,
he doesn &apos;t own a hunting license or even own a gun .
guy must have sucked at hunting , huh ?
i don &apos;t think it was about the hunting .
i think it was about where he was going .
where was that ?
niihau .
right . niihau .
i obviously know what you &apos;re talking about ,
but for the kid &apos;s sake ,
why don &apos;t you explain what that place is ?
right .
niihau is the northernmost island of hawaii .
it &apos;s also the largest private island in the world .
wait . some dude owns his own private island in hawaii ?
that &apos;s pretty pimp .
yeah , well ,
it &apos;s been owned by the same family since 1864 .
and they allow a small population of about a hundred native hawaiians to live there .
yup , no longer as interesting .
they live entirely off the land .
they have no telephones , no running water .
and the only way outsiders can visit is
through one of these exclusive hunting trips .
it &apos;s also home to thousands of plant species
that exist nowhere else in the world .
so what are we thinking ? cutler-- he goes over there
looking for this extinct plant , uh , he finds it ,
and somehow , it gets him killed ?
locals call it the forbidden island for a reason .
if anybody saw cutler taking plants from there illegally ,
i &apos;m sure they wouldn &apos;t take too kindly to it .
all right , we need to retrace cutler &apos;s steps ,
see who might have caught on to his secret .
first place we need to start is niihau .
okay , owners have a foreman who oversees operations .
i &apos;ll call ahead and get us cleared for helicopter transport .
i get to ride in a helicopter ?
no . finally , something cool happens .
no , no , no , you &apos;re not ...
you &apos;re not riding in a helicopter . i apologize .
we will stay here . uh , i &apos;ll do some work on cutler &apos;s computer .
we find out who hacked it ,
maybe we &apos;ll get our killer .
wait a minute .
crime lab said that &apos;s a dead end .
i know . i got a guy .
why don &apos;t you just admit , you don &apos;t like flying with me ?
okay , i don &apos;t like flying with you . have a safe flight .
we get two or three hunting parties coming through here every day .
once they touch down ,
the hunters are on their own .
well , the guy we &apos;re looking for has been here nine times
in the past three months .
you recognize him ?
honestly , when they &apos;re all
geared up in camo and guns , it &apos;s hard to tell them apart .
oh , this guy wasn &apos;t here to hunt .
we think he was splitting off on his own to explore the island .
well , if that &apos;s the case , it &apos;s hard to imagine he &apos;d have gone unnoticed .
you should try asking the locals .
but i got to warn you .
they &apos;re a little wary of outsiders .
we &apos;ll give it a shot .
he would go into the jungle on his own .
we &apos;ve also seen smoke coming from the same area ,
about three miles north .
when was the last time you saw him ?
not for a few days .
but the smoke was there this morning .
thank you for your help .
she recognized cutler .
a number of the locals saw him heading out into the jungle just on his own .
they also saw smoke coming from a spot
about three miles due north of here .
must be where cutler &apos;s laying up , right ?
mm @-@ hmm . exactly , and apparently , they saw smoke
there this morning , which means somebody else is out there .
and that somebody else could be our killer .
i need you to call back all the hunting parties
that are currently on the island .
we &apos;re going after a suspect .
we don &apos;t want anybody getting in the way .
hold on a second .
yeah , yeah , yeah , wait in the car . i get it .
no , no . i , uh ...
i , uh ... i was thinking about what i said to you this morning ,
and , um , i want to tell you that i @-@ i think it was wrong .
i want to apologize .
you mean when you were ragging on my nickname ?
&apos;cause i &apos;ve gotten over that .
can you just shut up for two seconds , please ?
i am trying to be serious , okay ?
okay , uh ... now , this , um ...
this may be hard to believe , um ,
but , um , there was a time in my life--
albeit a very brief one-- when i was not so different from you .
okay ? i thought i was a tough guy .
i got myself into some trouble .
uh , difference is , i had a @-@ a father around
to , uh , kick my ass , set me straight when i got out of line .
now , your mother , she is an amazing person ,
and she loves you very much ,
but she &apos;s completely and utterly incapable
of getting tough with you
and telling you the things that you need to hear .
which at this point in your life is ,
you &apos;ve , um ... accomplished nothing of note .
and have zero value to society .
is this normally how you apologize ?
&apos;cause you may want to rethink the approach .
right .
your mother , uh , she expects more of you .
eric , i expect more of you .
but more important than all of that ,
you should expect more from yourself .
you &apos;re right .
hmm . you want to repeat that , please ?
no .
you , uh ... you did good today .
why don &apos;t you come , uh , get my back ? how about that ?
really ?
yeah .
all right !
hello , hombres .
who are you ?
i &apos;m the guy who lives here in the house ,
whose door you just knocked on .
who are you ?
hey . we ask the questions .
hey , chill , bro .
my name &apos;s bullwinkle .
oh , okay , right .
you &apos;re , um , toast &apos;s roommate .
uh , is he home ?
yeah .
okay , good . can i speak to him , please ?
no , i meant , like , home home , in baltimore .
he went back for his sister &apos;s bat mitzvah .
i don &apos;t believe this .
i know . it &apos;s crazy , right ?
12 years old , and already a woman ,
according to the laws of moses .
little young , no ?
anyway , mazel tov .
where are my manners ?
would you like the first hit ?
uh , i , uh ... i would ,
except i &apos;m on duty , you see , so i can &apos;t do that .
oy . what , are you gonna , like , arrest me now ?
that all depends on how good are you with computers .
based on all these broken branches ,
somebody came through here recently .
i &apos;d say we &apos;re in the right place .
hey ! hey ! hands in the air ! five @-@ o !
put it down right now .
drop it .
put it down .
who are you ? what are you doing here ?
my name &apos;s dr. brian stephens .
i &apos;m a botanist . i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m just doing a little research here .
can you at least lower your weapons ?
we &apos;ll lower the weapons
when you tell us how you know joel cutler .
oh , look , i @-@ i ... guys , i know i &apos;m not supposed to be here ,
but can you leave joel out of it ?
he &apos;s just trying to help me out .
joel cutler is dead .
joel and i were roommates at stanford . uh ...
i went on to work as a botanist
for an agricultural engineering firm , and ...
well , then , three years ago , everything changed ,
when my son , avery-- he was diagnosed
with a degenerative disease . adrenoleukodystrophy .
yeah . i &apos;d never heard of it , either .
it &apos;s very rare .
it affects about one in every 100,000 .
and ever since my son &apos;s diagnosis , well ,
i &apos;ve dedicated my life to beating the disease .
okay , so that &apos;s ... that &apos;s why
you &apos;re out here-- searching for a cure ?
it &apos;s taken me some time , but i ...
i think i found it .
kawaihae hcaibishudelps .
its alkaloidal compounds
might have the key to beating the disease .
but i couldn &apos;t have done this alone .
so cutler was helping you .
that &apos;s why he was coming out here
and why he had samples of this plant on o &apos;ahu .
yeah . joel was a ... an amazing chemist .
he could see things in the data that i could never have found .
and now he &apos;s dead because of me .
who else knew what you guys were onto ?
no one .
we didn &apos;t want anyone to know where we discovered it .
well , somebody found out .
dude ?
why do you have so much ranch dressing ?
uh , because it &apos;s delicious ?
would you please stop ?
please let him concentrate . come here .
come over here .
all right . yeah .
pretty sneaky , but ...
you cannot hide from me .
gotcha .
gotcha ? what do you got ?
if i tell you , can i keep my pineapple bong ?
what bong ?
what we got here is a trojan horse virus .
it was embedded in an e @-@ mail attachment .
once it was opened ,
it gave the sender remote access to the computer .
okay , good . i need to know who sent the e @-@ mail .
you got it .
hey , danny , any luck with the computer ?
i &apos;d say so .
we just figured out who killed cutler .
who ?
you are not gonna believe this .
okay , the virus on cutler &apos;s computer was embedded
in an e @-@ mail attachment sent from ...
patrick roth .
his boss at the university .
he sent it as a memo to the entire chemistry department ,
so he could keep tabs on everybody .
roth must have gotten sick and tired of watching his employees
publish papers and cash in .
he sees that cutler is onto something big ,
he kills him so he can claim it as his own .
all right , i &apos;ll pick him up .
all right . chin and i are heading back now .
all right . got it .
that was danny .
hpd &apos;s still looking for roth .
nobody at his office knows where he is .
commander , i rounded up all of the hunting parties ,
but one person is still unaccounted for .
we &apos;ve tried radioing him , but he &apos;s not responding .
you got a name ?
according to the tour operator ,
his name is patrick roth .
roth must have found out cutler wasn &apos;t working alone .
yeah , and now he &apos;s come out here to take stephens out , too .
okay ?
yeah . yeah .
you even knock on the door ?
when i found out she changed her name ,
i figured it was just for safety .
you know , with guys out gunning for me ,
she don &apos;t want that blowing back on her and the boy .
but now that i seen this ...
i realize it &apos;s me she &apos;s protecting herself from .
you know what i don &apos;t get ?
is that you agreed to testify
just so you could track down your ex @-@ wife ,
but ... even if she took you back ,
i mean , you knew it wasn &apos;t gonna be happily ever after .
you had to know that
we were gonna catch you eventually .
i didn &apos;t even think about that .
i just ...
i just wanted to see her again .
you can take me back to jail now .
i &apos;ll make you a deal .
you follow through with the testimony tomorrow ,
and i &apos;ll pull some strings and get you transferred
back to halawa .
that way at least you can be close .
i busted the prosecuting attorney &apos;s head pretty good ,
and i don &apos;t see him cutting me no breaks .
that was the deputy prosecuting attorney .
i can sell the transfer
by getting you placed in maximum security .
it &apos;s harder to escape , and also ...
it &apos;ll protect you from all the guys who want you dead .
it won &apos;t do any good .
she &apos;s never gonna forgive me .
you never know .
people have a way of surprising sometimes .
how can a girl
who &apos;s so spicy also be so sweet , huh ?
don &apos;t make me change my mind . let &apos;s go .
that was an excellent move .
hey , guys .
just thought i &apos;d come and see how you two are doing .
avery , this is commander mcgarrett with five @-@ o.
it &apos;s nice to meet you , sir .
well , the honor &apos;s all mine , avery .
your dad &apos;s told me what a brave kid you are .
you mind if i steal your dad away for a second ?
no .
you got a sec ?
yeah .
good to meet you .
it &apos;s good to meet you , sir .
what &apos;s this ?
it &apos;s a letter , signed by the governor ,
giving you permission to carry on your research
on niihau for as long as it takes .
thank you , thank you .
you &apos;re welcome .
you okay ?
yeah . i think i know what i want to do in my life .
want to be a cop ?
no !
the job is way too stressful .
i want to work in a crime lab .
that &apos;s a very good career , eric .
it &apos;d be nice .
you need some sort of degree to do that ?
i don &apos;t think so .
you watch the discovery channel , right ?
should be okay . you know ?
that &apos;s good .
come on . i &apos;ll buy you a loco moco .
