i &apos;ll go check on your salads .
oleg , what &apos;s the hold up with the salads ?
i never made one before .
my two favorite guys , big doug and sancho ,
are ordering salads ?
what happened to their usual blts ?
burgers , lasagna , and tacos ?
they said they want to lose weight .
and no matter what you order ,
it &apos;s easier to throw up here than at home .
i don &apos;t get why nobody wants to be fat anymore .
the fat seasons of oprah were always the best .
奥普拉曾在节目上减重过几次 但也复胖了几次
you &apos;re right .
every other year of oprah was the best years .
what is this i hear about you blushing beauties on a diet ?
oh , we &apos;re not blushing .
we &apos;re just still flushed from sitting down .
and we &apos;re trying to get in shape .
yeah , preferably a shape
that doesn &apos;t resemble a seasonal gourd .
plus my girlfriend wants me to slim down
so we can sit on the same side of the plane when we travel .
well , big doug ,
you tell that lucky lady that i would rather date a man
with boobs bigger than mine
than a man who brings his own salad dressing to a restaurant .
pie me .
cherry , pumpkin , or coconut cream ?
yes .
max black ,
bringing smiles to men &apos;s faces since puberty .
i just talked to this guy at--
i think it &apos;s table three , i still don &apos;t know the numbers .
anyway , he asked , &quot; what &apos;s new ? &quot;
and i told him we were opening a dessert bar
at the airport tomorrow .
then i realized he was asking what kind of pot
i was selling this week .
why are you telling people about us and the airport ?
it &apos;s like when you told everyone you thought you had hpv .
that was a state @-@ mandated kind of thing .
oh , look who it is--
the airport people .
you guys putting together a little happy hour ?
with the jocks at southwest ?
or the &quot; in crowd &quot; at the virgin terminal ?
you know who &apos;s going to be a terminal virgin ?
you can make all the death threats you want ,
but you know what will keep me alive ?
the fact that you two work at the airport .
hey , everybody !
here comes the almost bride .
did you ever see a prettier almost bride ?
i mean , you know , besides jennifer aniston .
2012年宣布订婚 但到2015年都还没结婚
sophie , it &apos;s only one week till the wedding ,
so this is your last chance to take a run at me .
now you won &apos;t be disappointed .
i &apos;m still very sexually active
for the first five minutes .
oh , earl .
if i took a run at you ,
you &apos;d go right through that wall like wile e. coyote .
hey , bridesmaid .
hey , sophie .
hey , oleg .
you got a message from your brother in the ukraine .
yoshinko called ?
yeah , hear this message .
what was the message ?
&quot; hey , oleg , did you see last night &apos;s alf ? &quot;
nah ... i don &apos;t speak ukrainian .
i mean , what am i , a plumber in queens ?
no , so i brought the whole thing in .
here he is .
oleg ...
good @-@ bye .
what did he say ?
he &apos;s not coming .
i understood a little
&apos;cause i had a russian au pair growing up .
或者以服务学习语言的外国留学生
you know , until she bleached my good jeans .
yoshinko can &apos;t come to the wedding .
he &apos;s on a no @-@ fly list , a no @-@ drive list ,
and a no @-@ walk list .
he &apos;s in jail .
oh , but he was gonna be your best man .
i got a ham engraved for him .
don &apos;t worry , baby , i &apos;ll find someone .
it could be anyone .
he doesn &apos;t even have to be the best or even good .
i &apos;ll have to lower my standards .
han ,
will you be my best man ?
you said lower , not sub @-@ basement .
well , oleg , i &apos;ll need to think about it .
yes .
great . so han ,
you &apos;re in charge of the bachelor party tomorrow .
i want a night that will disgrace all involved .
a night where no one can look each other in the eye
at brunch the next day .
wow , han .
bachelor party &apos;s a big responsibility .
do you know any grown @-@ ups who can buy you beer ?
max , hurry .
the grand opening of this pink airport dungeon
is in a few minutes .
that tsa line took forever .
the woman with all those nickels ?
i haven &apos;t seen that much change on a lady
since chaz bono .
don &apos;t worry ,
i &apos;m making friends in the tsa .
judy , big gal , little beard ?
having lunch with her at the wok n &apos; roll
near malaysia airlines .
it &apos;s pretty quiet over there these days .
hey , ladies .
opening day , i &apos;m so excited
my nipples have been shooting daggers since i woke up .
seriously , i haven &apos;t been this excited
since my parents sent me to military school .
god , does everything have to be fun when you &apos;re gay ?
if it isn &apos;t , you &apos;re not doing it right .
i &apos;m just happy i get to be out front here .
finally , i won &apos;t be stuffed in the back .
i mean unless i run into a republican senator
in the men &apos;s room .
come on , let &apos;s open up .
but dat key though ?
i love this job .
wait , should someone make a speech ?
a speech ?
if you want to hear my thoughts on opening this place ,
i &apos;ll just cc you on my suicide note .
fine , i &apos;ll make a speech .
to all the school janitors who told me i &apos;d never have
my own giant set of keys ,
too big for any pocket ,
and that i wasn &apos;t a good kisser ?
they can all suck it .
yes ! rise , gate , rise !
ooh , you go , gate .
yes , i &apos;m drunk with power .
also , a little drunk .
all right . here they come .
yep .
any minute .
just our luck .
the one day the airport isn &apos;t crowded .
well , i guess i have time to go check my make @-@ up
in the men &apos;s room .
it &apos;s han .
he wants us to come to oleg &apos;s bachelor party tonight .
i &apos;ve gotten a call like this before ,
but usually it &apos;s through a service that involves
而舞蹈中抖乳进行流苏旋转是重要的一部分
making some tassels spin in opposite directions .
no way .
you know i was planning on going home and crying tonight .
han is planning a party .
you will cry there for sure .
that &apos;s true . i really can cry anywhere now .
i guess i &apos;ve got that at least .
i can &apos;t believe i work at the airport , max .
hey , would you feel better if you held my giant keys ?
hello ?
hello .
welcome , you &apos;re our first customer .
do i get a prize ?
is it you ?
i &apos;m on board now . i love this job .
welcome , everyone .
i &apos;m your m.c. , han lee ,
gonna get the crazy party started here
with some dirty , racy jokes .
this is the deadest place i &apos;ve ever been to ,
and i once woke up in heaven .
okay , here we go .
what do a rubik &apos;s cube and a penis have in common ?
the more you play with it , the harder it gets .
a rubik &apos;s cube was a popular &apos; 80s toy .
you suck ! next act .
what do a walrus and a tupperware have in common ?
hold on a minute .
something about a seal being tight ...
i just got a text from josh , the pilot .
he says , &quot; what &apos;s up , you ? &quot;
isn &apos;t that cute ?
cute that he forgot your name ?
it &apos;s really been a long time for you , hasn &apos;t it ?
i took off my underwear last week and a coyote howled .
tough crowd .
i &apos;m talking about you , max .
oh come on , han . loosen up .
have a drink .
a martini , an appletini , anything teeny .
nah , just do a vodka shot .
if nothing else , the glass will look normal @-@ sized in your hand
and i &apos;ll have a laugh .
can &apos;t hurt .
but it did .
thanks for the party , han .
what time is it starting ?
i &apos;ve never been a best man .
it &apos;s a lot of pressure .
yeah , being a man would be hard for you .
you &apos;ve never been one before .
let alone the best one .
what &apos;s in that , ground glass ?
ugh , this party is worse than the communist party .
and they killed half my family .
oleg , don &apos;t worry , i &apos;ll get this party started .
i &apos;m making a call to some girls i went to school with .
the slut academy on seventh .
commonly known as nyu .
i &apos;m more concerned about my cousin .
he has something i need .
soap ? deodorant ?
the toughest actin &apos; tinactin ?
oh , there he is !
well , he didn &apos;t bring the deodorant .
yuri , you made it .
are you the stripper ?
probably in a few years .
did you bring the papers ?
the papers i need to get married ?
and those little ukrainian candies i love ?
bad news .
the guy who made the fake papers got deported .
they took the papers .
i ate the candy .
what &apos;d i miss ?
besides my chance to become something ?
are you the stripper ?
nyet .
a compliment and an insult in just one word .
oh , no .
oh no , no , no , no , no .
did i mention &quot; no &quot; ?
how can you say the word &quot; no &quot;
but not understand it when women say it ?
this is a disaster .
and not the kind where i can loot .
i needed those fake papers to renew my fake green card .
mine expires next month .
since when do you care about expiration dates ?
you cook with eggs so old they fight back .
sophie will never believe that i &apos;m not marrying her
just for a green card .
she has major trust issues
since one day , her father went out for pierogies and ...
came back without pierogies .
i &apos;m really enjoying the dance stylings
of camel and toe up there .
everyone is having fun except oleg .
i haven &apos;t seen him so much as put the &quot; v &quot; fingers
in front of his mouth at any of these ladies .
wouldn &apos;t mind some over the sweater action with her .
hers or yours ?
max , i just did something i &apos;ve never done .
told a story about someone else ?
no , i sent the pilot a boob pic .
girl , you nasty .
i know . i am nasty !
i just looked into the camera with my boobs out and hit send .
ah @-@ ha , that &apos;s awesome .
uh , circling back now ,
did you say you looked into the camera ?
you didn &apos;t put your face in it , did you ?
girl !
you stupid .
how else would he know it was me ?
you never put your face in it .
didn &apos;t i raise you better than this ?
well , at least you weren &apos;t smiling in it .
all right , what kind of smile ?
a flirty smirk could work .
a come @-@ hither grin would be great .
more like ...
so you were in this ...
pose with your yabbos out ?
so you basically did a nude yogurt ad .
yeah , but like yogurt you want to have sex with , right ?
oh , my god .
sophie will be here any minute .
when i called , she was washing her hair .
she was going to put it back on her head and come .
just be honest with her .
sometimes the truth is ugly .
but she knows that . she &apos;s seen you naked .
well , still no text back so apparently not as ugly as this .
what &apos;s that about ?
are you selling real estate now ?
oh , wow .
i mean , this party couldn &apos;t get any sleazier
unless you invited robin thicke .
i &apos;m looking up at skanky whore city ,
but i trust you , oleg .
you do ?
yeah , why wouldn &apos;t i ?
aside from my complicated past
full of men that have lied to me .
but you and i don &apos;t have secrets from each other , right , oleg ?
yeah , well , you see--
it is time for the traditional best man speech .
so listen up , bitches .
ow , damn it .
i am bleeding .
repeat , i am bleeding .
i can &apos;t believe this .
there &apos;s an app that burps when you shake your phone ,
but no app that unsends a boob pic ?
sophie . oleg .
what &apos;s there to say about these two kids ?
oleg is a bad cook .
sophie , quite loud .
but somehow , when they get together , magic .
you suck , next act !
says the lady that works at the airport .
and , oleg , i &apos;m so glad sophie is marrying you
so now you can stay in the country .
oh , no . uh ...
you suck . next act ?
yeah , i hear ya girl .
i mean that last joke didn &apos;t even have a punch line .
yeah , i mean , it was sort of sad .
it was no joke .
this is serious .
it &apos;s really serious .
that boob pic is up in the cloud now .
my boob is in the cloud , y &apos;all .
sophie , i didn &apos;t know how to tell you .
you wanted to marry me for a green card ?
see , i thought you were marrying me for my bod .
or for my connections at the container store , or ...
i mean , i taught you how to read !
sophie , i can explain .
no , no , no . the wedding &apos;s off .
oh , no .
what the hell am i going to do with all those pigeons
that i had painted wedding white ?
sophie , wait .
aww , well , look who it is .
my dearly deported .
i worked on that the whole way over .
sophie , i &apos;m not gonna be deported .
i &apos;m gonna marry someone so i can stay in this country
and win you back .
i don &apos;t care who my new bride is .
just upfront , it can &apos;t be me .
&apos;cause everybody knows i &apos;m married to my work .
and it can &apos;t be me .
it just can &apos;t .
they don &apos;t even have to be the best or even good .
standards are out the window .
look , it &apos;s a california raisin .
sunglasses and advil .
last night was mad real .
han ,
will you marry me so i can stay in the country ?
i &apos;ll need to think about it .
yes .
apparently the only thing he won &apos;t say yes to is health care .
oleg , i don &apos;t believe you .
this is just another trick to get me to do
what you want me to do .
like when you kept &quot; dropping &quot; your ice cream into your lap .
no trick .
sometimes love makes you do crazy , disgusting things .
like this .
come here , han .
and now i love this job , too !
thank god he picked han .
wow , sophie . oleg must really love you .
that had to be hard for him .
and from what i can see , a little hard for han , too .
at our wedding , maybe two pumps of breath spray .
han , you &apos;re not marrying oleg .
&apos;cause oleg &apos;s marrying me .
i believe you now .
&apos;cause you kissed han ,
and asian girls aren &apos;t even your thing .
oh my god , max , it &apos;s my boob pic .
someone made it into a meme .
a mammo meme ?
you &apos;re not supposed to need those &apos; til you &apos;re 40 .
my boob pic is gonna be hanging over me for the rest of my life .
oh , come on ,
your boob couldn &apos;t hang over a pencil .
