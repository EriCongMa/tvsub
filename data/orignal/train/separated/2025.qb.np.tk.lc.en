why am i being suspended ? i didn &apos;t leak any documents .
you were unfairly punished ,
and i would like to officially welcome you back .
i want a raise .
fine .
and pearson hardman pays for law school
when i decide to go .
agreed .
i fronted your buy @-@ in .
how could you do that ?
you were about to take a job somewhere else .
we need to start being honest with each other .
you want me off this case ,
so i don &apos;t get anywhere near the spotlight .
in your position ,
the spotlight can become an interrogation lamp
pretty damn fast .
this is always how it &apos;s gonna be , isn &apos;t it ?
i thought you knew that .
i guess i did .
i need you to use your power
to give me this case over scottie .
are you asking as a friend , or are you calling in a chit ?
calling in a chit .
does this have something to do with that favor he did you ?
yes .
tell me what it is .
i can &apos;t .
guess we &apos;re not sharing everything
with each other after all .
time to wake up , sweetie .
oh , five more minutes , mom .
did you just call me mom ?
what ? no .
louis , i &apos;ve said it before .
the bedroom is a no @-@ mom @-@ talk zone .
understood .
you have to catch your train .
i &apos;ll take the later one .
who are you ,
and what have you done with my boyfriend , louis litt ?
oh , you mean the guy
who sweats profusely before closing arguments ?
yeah . yeah , that guy &apos;s gone .
really ?
oh , my god .
you &apos;re completely dry .
your love has made me dry , sheila .
i &apos;m a changed man .
in fact ... i &apos;m gonna rock your world for one more hour ,
and then i &apos;m gonna kick some ass in court .
&apos;cause today nothing can go wrong .
today is my goddamn day .
yeah . it is .
can you pass the sugar ?
yeah , of course .
okay , how &apos; bout that milk ?
sounds great .
how would you feel about me dating other women
now that we &apos;re living together and all ?
pizza &apos;s perfect .
rachel .
what &apos;s going on ?
i got my tuition payment schedule , and ...
that is a big bill .
yeah , and that &apos;s not even the problem .
remember when louis fired me
because he thought that i was leaking information ?
i never told you about
negotiating the terms of my return .
yeah , you did .
he gave you a 10 % raise .
that &apos;s not all he gave me .
he agreed that the firm would pay for me
to go to law school when i got in .
so what &apos;s the problem ?
it &apos;s gonna be an awkward conversation .
rachel , you want to be a lawyer ,
you &apos;re gonna have to have a lot of awkward conversations .
yeah , but not like this .
i mean , &quot; hey , louis , do you remember when i demanded
&quot; that you pay for me to go to law school ?
&quot; i get that since then you &apos;ve now tried to help me get in
&quot; and that we &apos;re friends ,
but i would really like my money now . &quot;
okay . so don &apos;t talk to him .
just get ready to write a check for $ 200,000,
because that &apos;s what it &apos;s gonna cost for the next three years .
awkward conversation it is .
best of luck .
norma , it &apos;s louis .
louis litt , your boss .
don &apos;t play your games with me now , woman .
i &apos;m due for closing arguments in 30 minutes ,
and i need you to stall .
no , you do not pull the fire alarm as a tactic , okay ?
i need you to just buy me ten minutes
without committing a crime .
taxi !
there we go . come on , baby . my man .
oh , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , don &apos;t you upstream me .
that &apos;s my cab . that &apos;s my taxi .
this is my cab . this is my cab .
hey , i &apos;m gonna sue you . i &apos;m gonna sue you for sucking .
i &apos;m gonna sue you for not being--
okay , i need your name , date of birth , and i need--
all right , let &apos;s litt this up .
what did you do to scottie ?
nothing .
that is not nothing .
that is a soy caramel latte
with a double shot of fear and guilt .
that is an apology coffee .
why can &apos;t it just be an &quot; i &apos;m a great boyfriend &quot; coffee ?
if you &apos;re such a great boyfriend ,
why don &apos;t you know that your girlfriend is on her way
to chicago for the wexler deposition ?
so i repeat , what did you do ?
i overruled her on franklin courier .
i made her give the case back to louis .
you got in the middle of it ?
why would you do that ?
look , i don &apos;t want to get into it right now , donna .
okay .
but , harvey , if you really did do that to her ,
coffee isn &apos;t gonna cut it .
for the record , this was not my goal .
mr. litt .
sorry , your honor . sorry i &apos;m late .
are you ready for closing arguments ?
yes , i am .
ladies and gentlemen of the jury ,
opposing counsel has accused my client of a great many things .
but you see , here &apos;s the problem .
they don &apos;t have one single fact to back up their claim .
i mean , not one .
so you know what i &apos;m gonna do ? i &apos;m gonna challenge you .
actually , no , scratch that .
i &apos;m gonna dare you to find dispute
with the facts of this case as we presented them .
&apos;cause are you a good person ?
yes .
are you a good person ? yes .
are you--actually , you took notes , so i can see you care .
you see , this is the kind of jury that they teach about .
this is the kind of jury that &apos;s gonna hear me
when i say these four words .
do you know what those four words are ?
because i want you to remember these four words
to your dying breath .
he didn &apos;t do it !
he didn &apos;t do it .
mr. litt , are you okay ?
i &apos;m all right . yeah , i &apos;m fine .
bailiff , call an ambulance .
was that it , are we done ?
harvey , you &apos;ve signed three checks .
and ?
just go .
oh , by the way , how &apos;s mike ross doing ?
what are you talking about ?
he just came up with the huge stemple solution .
he &apos;s doing great .
so i guess he didn &apos;t tell you about our little conversation ?
what conversation ?
the one where he ran into the fact that he has a glass ceiling .
mike knows he has a glass ceiling .
he knows , but he didn &apos;t know .
we have a problem with william beck .
who &apos;s william beck ?
division head of coastal radiance sunscreen .
he &apos;s trying to break his contract .
i assume he has a non @-@ compete .
no , harvey , i was dumb enough to let him do whatever he wants .
why is he trying to leave ?
he has some ideas about the product line
that we &apos;re not implementing .
does he have another offer ?
neutrogena wants him .
they can &apos;t have him .
he can go work at starbucks , but he &apos;s not touching this market .
excuse me , but maybe there &apos;s a solution .
coastal radiance is a division of pure moisture skincare .
spin them off .
beck gets to run his own company ,
both stocks go up , everybody wins .
if i had wanted the junior associate to come up with an idea ,
i &apos;d have asked the junior associate to come up with an idea .
tony , he &apos;s not wrong .
coastal radiance is undervalued ,
and this fixes that .
beck has been with us for ten years .
maybe it &apos;s worth running the numbers on the spin @-@ off .
i don &apos;t want to run the numbers .
i want him out now .
so have your boy work up the exit paperwork .
jonathan will sign off .
your company , your call .
you want to talk about what just happened in there ?
not particularly .
look , it was a good idea . he should &apos;ve listened to it .
i know it was a good idea .
what i don &apos;t know is why you didn &apos;t push back .
were you in there ? i did push back .
when you push back , you change people &apos;s minds ,
which means either you didn &apos;t agree with me
or you don &apos;t care enough to change his mind .
look , i know when it &apos;s time to change someone &apos;s mind
and when it isn &apos;t ,
and all pushing harder in that meeting would &apos;ve done
was make him dig in .
we had an ally . jonathan agreed with me .
yeah , and then he agreed with his boss ,
which is what we &apos;re gonna do ,
because it &apos;s the way the world works .
come on , harvey .
mike .
this man goes through lawyers like a hot knife through butter ,
and i wasn &apos;t about to get us fired
to protect some guy i don &apos;t even give a shit about .
now are you on board with that ?
i &apos;m on board . can we move on ?
i have nothing to move on to .
i do .
have you called scottie and apologized yet ?
apologize for what ?
what are you , the apology police ?
if you &apos;re the one under investigation ,
i &apos;ll sign up for that .
jessica , if you need me to sign any more checks ,
now would be a great time .
it &apos;s louis .
let me guess .
even though he didn &apos;t show up to the meeting ,
he &apos;s feeling left out and throwing a hissy fit .
he had a heart attack in court this morning .
oh , my god .
he &apos;s okay .
i made a call ,
he &apos;s got the best cardiologists at mount sinai ,
and they say he &apos;s going to be fine .
we should go see him .
he told norma he didn &apos;t want anybody to come .
that means he &apos;s embarrassed , but he wants me there .
i &apos;ll be back when i &apos;m back .
we handle all his cases personally .
nothing with louis &apos; name on it falls through the cracks .
no client finds out this happened .
done .
done .
i &apos;ll send him flowers from all of us .
no .
he &apos;s allergic .
to flowers ?
all of them ?
how do you even know that ?
i used to send them to his desk every day
when we were associates .
i know .
i &apos;m an asshole .
he &apos;s gonna be okay , right ?
oh , my god .
this is awful .
yeah , i know .
all morning all i &apos;ve been thinking about is how
i don &apos;t want to talk to him about the tuition , and now--
hey , rachel , rachel . hey , come on .
look at me .
he &apos;s gonna be okay .
he &apos;ll be back , and you guys can have a lifetime
of working together , going to the ballet ,
having really awkward conversations .
rachel , i &apos;m gonna say the thing
that i know you don &apos;t want to hear .
i don &apos;t care about that right now .
it doesn &apos;t have to be a big deal .
we &apos;ve all got louis &apos; back right now ,
and jessica handles this stuff anyway .
just talk to her .
you are never allowed to have a heart attack .
okay ?
understood .
louis .
is this heaven ?
i can understand why you would think that ,
but no .
i don &apos;t know how this can happen .
i ... treat my body like a temple .
and you &apos;ve also been commuting every weekend ,
and you let the associates raise your blood pressure .
it &apos;s because they &apos;re stupid .
okay , louis , relax .
the doctors say you &apos;re out of danger ,
but you shouldn &apos;t get worked up .
the doctors need to let me go .
you had a heart attack .
if my blood supply had been cut off for a half @-@ second less ,
it would &apos;ve been classified as a minor cardiac event .
and what if it would have lasted half a second more ?
it didn &apos;t .
and i need to get to work .
louis , i &apos;m serious . you have to cut back .
you could have died .
and if anything were to happen to you ...
harvey would be a total mess . okay ?
i &apos;ll cut back .
good .
excuse me . it &apos;s mike , right ?
yeah . did you still need something ?
because i haven &apos;t finished yet .
i did . i &apos;ve been trying to find louis .
he wasn &apos;t at the meeting .
louis isn &apos;t here .
where is he ?
what did you need to see him about ?
i want to talk about what happened .
yeah , um ,
look , i know that we both agreed
that a spin @-@ off was the better way to go , but--
i don &apos;t want to talk about that .
i want to talk about me .
i want out .
you want to leave gianopolous
because of what happened this morning ?
what happened this morning happens every day .
he keeps people down when they reach a certain point ,
and i &apos;m pretty sure i &apos;m at that point .
yeah , i get it .
no , you don &apos;t .
you don &apos;t . no .
in a place like this ,
your whole future &apos;s laid out for you .
you &apos;ll be running the place before 40 .
jonathan , we work for tony gianopolous .
and i know i don &apos;t have to tell you ,
but you &apos;re working under the same non @-@ compete
that william beck is .
but you work for me too .
louis is my personal attorney .
i know .
but if there &apos;s a conflict of interest ,
we &apos;re gonna choose him .
i know that you have a conflict .
i &apos;m just asking , is there any way that you can help me
without ...
helping me ?
i &apos;m sorry .
then where &apos;s louis ?
louis is away on business right now ,
so he can &apos;t help you either .
then i &apos;ll find someone who will .
let this serve as formal notice i &apos;m letting him go .
michigan court of appeals .
what ?
there was a ruling a few years ago
that established a weak link in the non @-@ compete .
i &apos;m sorry to interrupt . do you have a minute ?
what can i do for you ?
the timing on this is terrible ,
and i @-@ i apologize for that .
what is it ?
i need the first check for my law school tuition .
excuse me ?
maybe you don &apos;t remember , but when i was wrongfully dismissed ,
one of the terms of my rehiring
was that the firm pays for my law school .
i remember just fine .
and the only term of your rehiring
was a 10 % increase in salary .
what ?
no , i &apos;m--i &apos;m telling you this was an agreed @-@ upon term ,
and--
and i &apos;m telling you
i know nothing about that .
and if i had heard about it ,
i would have never approved it .
i was scapegoated by this firm .
and when you agreed to come back ,
you were given a 10 % raise .
that &apos;s standard .
my situation was not standard .
in what way ?
louis accused me of being disloyal .
and ?
and he turned out to be wrong .
the problem , rachel ,
is that you have no record of what you &apos;re saying .
he agreed to it .
he is your agent .
you &apos;re bound by this .
i don &apos;t know that .
and the man just had a heart attack .
and i &apos;m not going to call him and ask him .
i know that , and i don &apos;t want you to .
then this conversation is over .
dr. iverson to the cardiac lab .
dr. iverson to the cardiac lab .
what the hell are you doing ?
sheila .
i &apos;m so sorry .
you should be .
i don &apos;t know why i had a heart attack ,
but i promise it won &apos;t happen again .
you think i &apos;m mad because you had a heart attack ?
it &apos;s a sign of weakness . you hate weakness .
no , i hate that you &apos;re doing work .
sheila--
no , louis ,
do you know what i was thinking about the whole way down here ?
i was thinking that if you died ,
i &apos;d want to die too .
so you better start taking care of yourself ,
because i don &apos;t want to--
sheila--
no . no more work .
okay , but this isn &apos;t what you think it is .
don &apos;t fight me on this , please .
okay , but i need that--
don &apos;t fight me on this !
&quot; sheila , as long as i &apos;ve known you ,
i &apos;ve had a ...
i &apos;ve had a feeling of completeness .
romeo and juliet .
antony and cleopatra . &quot;
you crossed out jaime and cersei lannister .
i thought they were too controversial a couple .
too controversial for what ?
a proposal .
what ?
sheila , i could &apos;ve died .
and i don &apos;t want my life to have ended without--
louis , i don &apos;t want you to ask me what you &apos;re about to ask me
because you &apos;re afraid to die alone .
no .
it &apos;s not about that .
it &apos;s not about dying alone .
it &apos;s about living without the woman i love .
sheila amanda sazs ,
you are the love of what i hope will be my very , very long life .
and i can &apos;t spend one more second of it without you .
will you marry me ?
yes .
yes , i &apos;ll marry you .
tony , what can i do for you ?
you screwed me over .
by figuring out how to fire the guy you told us to fire ?
by telling my number two how to break his non @-@ compete .
i did nothing of the kind .
then it was louis litt .
no way . that did not happen .
that &apos;s bullshit , harvey , we had a meeting .
jonathan stuck around for the paperwork .
then suddenly he comes back with his resignation
and some michigan appeals court precedent
for breaking our deal .
well , he couldn &apos;t have met with louis
because louis wasn &apos;t even in the office .
then it was someone else .
tony , what exactly do you want ?
you want me to fire him like we &apos;re firing beck ?
i &apos;ll tell you a little secret .
i don &apos;t give a shit whether beck goes or not .
but can you understand why i want him crushed ?
because you want people like jonathan sidwell
to know what happens when they try to leave .
finally my lawyer shows up .
oh , i &apos;ve been here the whole time .
you see it how you want to see it .
but if you can &apos;t figure out a way to make jonathan stay ,
you &apos;ll be the one who &apos;s gone .
tony .
i &apos;m gonna fix this , but let &apos;s get one thing clear .
i &apos;m not like the other lawyers you &apos;ve burned through .
so the next time you go stomping around
like a four @-@ year @-@ old throwing tantrums with me ,
i &apos;ll be the one getting rid of you .
guess you were never really on board after all .
what ? i did the paperwork for beck .
i &apos;m not talking about beck .
i &apos;m talking about jonathan sidwell .
michigan court of appeals sound familiar ?
harvey , he was gonna fire louis .
if that &apos;s the advice he was looking for from louis ,
he &apos;d have fired him anyway .
and jonathan would &apos;ve found that loophole anyway .
but instead he got it from you .
what do you want from me ? louis had a heart attack .
jessica told us not to--
don &apos;t hide behind that shit .
let &apos;s get into what this is really about .
what the hell are you talking about ?
i &apos;m talking about your conversation with jessica .
so that &apos;s why you were telling me my idea was so good
after our gianopolous meeting .
yeah . we had that conversation .
and yeah , it sucks .
but this has nothing to do with that .
then prove it .
prove what ?
he &apos;s unhappy with his situation .
when people are unhappy , they find a way out .
which brings me back to my point .
you weren &apos;t really on board .
i told you , i took care of beck .
well , now you &apos;re gonna do the same for jonathan .
the michigan ruling clearly states that he has--
don &apos;t quote precedent to me .
you figured out how he could break the non @-@ compete ,
now figure out how to enforce it .
harvey--
enough .
you &apos;re a pretty good lawyer when you want to be ,
so maybe try doing it for our side this time .
bad night ?
only if you call figuring out a way
to crush someone &apos;s hopes and dreams bad .
what about you ?
you , uh , take care of that awkward conversation ?
yeah , it wasn &apos;t awkward . it was ...
humiliating .
louis never actually told jessica .
what ? that &apos;s bullshit .
he made a promise to you . he &apos;s an agent of the firm .
you know , i never thought about that .
maybe i should just rush to his hospital bed
and get him to admit that he screwed me over .
how could he lie to me like that ?
rachel , why he lied to you doesn &apos;t matter .
it matters to me .
well , you said it yourself .
do you really want to upset him just to find out ?
of course not .
then take the emotion out of it .
what are you talking about ?
it &apos;s a contract problem .
figure out a way to enforce the contract .
i have someone here to see you .
donna , i don &apos;t have time to see anyone right--
oh , look who it is . where the hell have you been ?
harvey , don &apos;t be a dick . he had a heart attack .
and you think having a heart attack
gives you the right to take the day off ?
i &apos;m alive .
help me .
hug him back .
i &apos;m gonna let you two be alone .
okay , not that i &apos;m not enjoying this , but ...
shouldn &apos;t you be home ?
no , the doctor cleared me to come back .
sheila &apos;s allowing me half days .
the other half of the day ...
i &apos;m at home planning my wedding .
you &apos;re engaged ?
it &apos;s the happiest moment of my life .
i &apos;ll send my condolences to the bride @-@ to @-@ be .
that kind of sense of humor
is exactly what i want of my best man .
louis , are you asking me to be your best--
harvey , before you answer ,
i am sorry my fight with scottie put you in a bad situation .
and i know calling in my chit with you
jeopardized our friendship , but ...
louis--
let me just finish .
you said i can &apos;t have it both ways , but--
i &apos;d be honored .
thank you , harvey .
you &apos;re welcome , louis .
mr. kovacs .
yes ?
mike ross . pearson specter .
do we have business together ?
jonathan sidwell .
i understand you made him an offer
to run your investment division .
jonathan reached out to me with a proposal , and i liked it .
did he happen to mention the fact
that he &apos;s under a non @-@ compete ?
yes .
he also mentioned that
the michigan court of appeals decision
makes his contract breakable .
i had my lawyers look into it . he &apos;s right .
did you also have your lawyers
look into the theft of intellectual property ?
what are you talking about ?
i &apos;m talking about the algorithm
that jonathan developed to identify
companies ripe for takeover .
my employee , my algorithm .
wrong .
jonathan developed it while under contract
with tony gianopolous , which makes it his property .
what do you want ?
i don &apos;t want anything .
i just came down here
to let you know you can go ahead
and do whatever you care to with jonathan sidwell ,
but if you use his algorithm ,
we &apos;re gonna sue you for every penny that comes from it .
i heard you were back .
should you be doing that ?
prescribed .
light walking . need to get the blood flowing .
okay .
good .
look , louis , i am--
i &apos;m sorry about what happened . i really am .
well , i &apos;m gonna be fine , rachel .
good .
i actually wanted to talk to you about a contracts issue .
shoot .
okay .
a friend of mine entered into a verbal agreement
with an agent for a corporation , and now he &apos;s reneging on it .
wait a second , why verbal ?
why not ?
verbal contracts are binding , and she knows it .
she have it on tape ?
no .
well , then he can lie about it , or he can argue the wording .
no , he made a clear promise .
well , maybe it was a promise to try ,
or maybe it was a suggestion .
no , it wasn &apos;t .
what &apos;s the contract ?
employment bonus .
lump sum or payable over time ?
three @-@ year term .
well , then verbal ain &apos;t shit .
if it &apos;s paid over a year or more , it has to be written .
my friend made life decisions based on this promise .
she could sue for promissory estoppel .
若允诺者食言 则需赔付相应损失
well , she could sue the dick who made the deal ,
but she can &apos;t sue the company .
she doesn &apos;t want to do that .
let me ask you this .
why wouldn &apos;t she get it in writing if it was legit ?
because she trusted him .
she doesn &apos;t know why he would lie to her .
he did because he could .
he wanted what he wanted when he wanted it ,
and it cost him nothing .
you know ?
yeah .
maybe she should go after him .
she could try .
but i mean , realistically , she &apos;ll lose , and she should ,
because stupidity shouldn &apos;t be rewarded .
so glad you came to see me . you really got my juices going .
make me feel glad to be back .
this is nice , fiance .
it is nice , betrothed .
so where should we do it ?
sheila , are you serious ? i just had a heart attack .
i &apos;m talking about the wedding .
i say we do it here .
get married in new york ?
it &apos;s where our relationship began .
i think it &apos;s only fitting that we tie the knot here .
i love you .
good , then it &apos;s decided .
we &apos;ll do it here
and then move straight to boston .
what do you mean move to boston ?
i &apos;m not moving to boston .
you have to . you know what harvard means to me .
you know what pearson specter means to me .
okay , louis , there are a dozen firms
that would snap you up in a second there .
same goes for law schools here .
yeah , but they &apos;re not harvard ,
which means they &apos;re second tier .
you seriously expected me to drop everything
and move to new york ?
yeah , i did .
okay , well , i think that &apos;s a little presumptuous .
me ?
what about you ?
you &apos;re the one who has us buying a place on bacon hill .
okay , it &apos;s &quot; beacon hill , &quot; and i thought you liked it .
to visit . i mean , not to live .
and what are you talking about , our law schools are second tier ?
your city is second tier .
well , maybe my city is second tier .
but it &apos;s also the home of the woman you supposedly love .
oh , sheila , come on , please .
i mean , everything i have is in new york .
everything except me .
it &apos;s usually easier if you look at the screen
with your eyes .
i &apos;m--i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s just been one of those weeks .
you know louis is gonna be okay , right ?
yeah , i know he &apos;s going to be okay .
but at the moment , i hate his guts .
i hear congratulations are in order .
jessica .
another eligible bachelor bites the dust .
yeah . i mean , no , it &apos;s--
it &apos;s amazing .
how are you feeling ?
better , thanks .
i wanted to get you a little welcome @-@ back something .
it &apos;s not much .
you know , you gave me quite a scare this week .
i love it .
the pearson hardman retreat five years ago .
and do you know what i remember most about that night ?
what an amazing dancer you are .
five years , long island school of ballet .
you weren &apos;t dancing ballet that night .
well , they say ballet is the foundation for everything .
well , sir , you have an amazing foundation .
i just thought you could add that to your collection .
somewhere between you and ... bruno .
it means so much to me that you ...
louis .
come on .
after everything we &apos;ve been through ,
you &apos;re family .
holy shit .
i know .
he betrayed me .
maybe , but , rachel ,
you didn &apos;t even give him a chance to explain himself .
i didn &apos;t want to upset him .
even if he was bullshiting you back then ,
the louis i know is a man of his word .
and if you went to him honestly--
it wouldn &apos;t matter .
he would just say he agreed to it ,
and jessica would still say no .
he might offer to pay .
absolutely not . i wouldn &apos;t let him .
and you know what , that &apos;s not the problem .
what is the problem ?
the problem is he made me a chump .
rachel--
donna , i went in there
as a paralegal trying to negotiate with louis litt ,
and i left with the money to become a lawyer ,
and for the first time in my life ,
i felt like i could actually be one .
and now i realize that ...
when i left that room ,
he was probably laughing about how he pulled one over on me .
maybe you &apos;re right .
but i &apos;m telling you , the louis of today would never do that .
well , the rachel of today certainly wouldn &apos;t
let him get away with it .
and the donna of today is a genius .
well , the genius of donna is every day .
what are you saying ?
just because you can &apos;t go after louis
doesn &apos;t mean you can &apos;t still make your case .
what the hell is wrong with you ?
you gave me the map to escape
and told the guards where i &apos;d be .
jonathan--
kovacs rescinded his offer .
he said i &apos;m not worth it without that algorithm .
listen , i &apos;m sorry .
sorry ?
you gave me that advice in the first place .
because you threatened to leave louis .
bullsh-- .
you did it because you knew what i was up against ,
and you were trying to help me .
whether that &apos;s true or not ,
that advice was off the record ,
and it turns out that on the record it &apos;s my job to stop you .
well , congratulations .
you ripped away the thing i value the most .
that algorithm-- it took me ten years to develop it .
it &apos;s how i look at valuing companies .
it &apos;s how i look at the world .
if i can &apos;t take it with me ,
even if someone thinks i &apos;m worth something , i &apos;m not .
jonathan--
please .
you did your job on the record .
now off the record , what do i do ?
it was my job to make sure there &apos;s nothing you could do .
then check in with me in ten years .
&apos;cause i promise you i &apos;ll be at the same desk
punching the same clock .
can &apos;t move up , can &apos;t move out .
it &apos;s on you .
you were right .
this isn &apos;t about william beck or jonathan sidwell .
it &apos;s about me .
mike--
i want to go legit .
you can &apos;t .
harvey , listen--
do i need to state the obvious ?
i can go to law school now , all right ? get a real degree .
even if it didn &apos;t matter
that you &apos;ve already presented yourself
as having gone to harvard law ,
you &apos;d have to take the bar again .
okay , i passed it once , i &apos;ll pass it again .
not under your own name .
and if you take it now ,
you &apos;ll draw attention to yourself in a major way .
then i get lola jensen to hack into the bar
and just put me in there , just like she did with harvard .
are you insane ?
hacking into the bar is twice the crime
you &apos;ve been committing .
rule number one of not getting caught ,
you don &apos;t move the goddamn body .
you do if they &apos;re about to find it .
they &apos;re not about to find it .
they &apos;re always about to find it !
mike , committing another fraud to cover your fraud
isn &apos;t going legit .
it &apos;s just covering your ass , and it doesn &apos;t undo
the fact that you &apos;ve already committed the crime .
you think i haven &apos;t thought about all of this ?
harvey , i &apos;m stuck .
there &apos;s no way up , there &apos;s no way down .
i can &apos;t live my whole life like this .
okay .
you want to be legit ,
there &apos;s only one way .
you go to a small town in iowa
where nobody &apos;s ever heard of harvey specter ,
jessica pearson , or anybody else .
you go to law school , hang out your shingle .
nobody will ever know .
i guarantee you &apos;d be king of the hill .
but you could never come back to the mountain .
not here in new york , chicago , or l.a.
someone will know someone ,
and it &apos;ll all be for nothing .
i can &apos;t do that , and you know it .
i do know it .
mike , you &apos;re in the major leagues ,
and you get to go toe @-@ to @-@ toe with the best there is .
and i can &apos;t tell you if that &apos;s enough for a lifetime ,
but if you want to stay , there &apos;s nothing more you can do .
my advice is hold on tight and enjoy the ride .
what are you doing here ?
i &apos;m here to help you .
you said there was no way to stop what you did .
this isn &apos;t a legal solution . it &apos;s a business solution .
one where everybody wins .
everybody wins ?
that &apos;s what you said about beck .
so you want me to spin off my own company ,
i run it , he owns it ?
i never said that .
well , he didn &apos;t go for it with beck .
why would he go for it with me ?
because he doesn &apos;t give a sh-- about william beck .
what are you saying ?
you develop your algorithm every day .
of course .
it &apos;s useless if i don &apos;t .
right , but that &apos;s not why you do it .
you do it because you love it .
well , he can force me to stay ,
but he can &apos;t force me to love it .
and that &apos;s exactly where your leverage is .
if you don &apos;t love what you do , it costs him a fortune .
and he knows it .
this isn &apos;t a sure thing .
which is why i &apos;m trusting he won &apos;t know
it came from me if it doesn &apos;t work .
why are you doing this ?
let &apos;s just say i love my job ...
but i know what it feels like to be trapped .
donna said you wanted to see me
about some more managerial bullshit .
what ?
don &apos;t you think i learned my lesson with the checks ?
then why am i here ?
you &apos;re here to listen to me .
do you know what this is about ?
yes . and i already told you--
i am not here to ask you to honor louis &apos; contract .
i am here to ask you to make a new one with me .
our contract with you
is a promise of a job when you get out ,
not paying for you on your way in .
i have a list here of the signing bonuses
of the top three associates who have come into this firm .
give me an advance on mine .
the last time we negotiated , you said ,
&quot; never sign something without getting something in return . &quot;
what you &apos;re getting in return
is that i keep working here part @-@ time .
the advance , plus my salary , will cover my tuition .
paralegals don &apos;t make that much .
those numbers don &apos;t add up .
i &apos;m not proposing being a paralegal .
some of the associates work as lawyers ,
and i can do the same .
you came up with that pretty fast .
it &apos;s almost as if you wanted me
to ask you what i get in return .
do we have a deal ?
one problem .
you already asked me to break precedent once
when i waived the harvard rule .
i &apos;m not breaking it again to pay for law school .
i &apos;m not asking you to break anything .
you already established precedence , with him .
when you paid for his law school .
that is not common knowledge .
no , it &apos;s not .
that &apos;s why she wanted me here .
i &apos;m exhibit a .
you made an investment in harvey ,
and i think that turned out pretty well .
i could argue that point .
no , rachel &apos;s right . i &apos;m pretty awesome .
i assume you have this in writing .
i wouldn &apos;t be worth it if i didn &apos;t .
let me guess . he went for it .
he did .
you want me to set up your new corporation ?
i want you to join my new corporation .
it &apos;s an offer letter .
i don &apos;t understand .
you said you know what it &apos;s like to feel trapped .
thought maybe you &apos;d like a way out .
i also said i love what i do .
maybe .
but let me tell you what i once told louis litt .
we &apos;re not lawyers . we &apos;re investment bankers .
our job blows yours out of the water .
wait a second .
you &apos;re not asking me to be your in @-@ house counsel .
you kidding me ?
most people don &apos;t even know what an algorithm is .
you used it to strong @-@ arm me and tony gianopolous .
you have a mind for this .
jonathan ...
you don &apos;t have to answer right now .
just think about this .
you &apos;re in the minor leagues here .
i &apos;m giving you a chance to play in the majors .
i &apos;m glad you came .
i hope you don &apos;t mind .
i thought you might like it .
sheila ...
it &apos;s just a gesture .
it &apos;s a beautiful gesture .
you &apos;re so ...
you &apos;re everything .
oh , no , is this where you tell me
that you &apos;re not gonna move to boston ?
not everybody sees me the way you do .
most people take a very , very long time to figure me out .
it &apos;s taken me years and years to get the people here to see
past my short temper and my ...
weird obsessions .
your love of mudding is not weird .
well , you see , i know that .
you know who else knows that ?
donna ,
jessica , mike , rachel , and harvey .
they appreciate me .
they &apos;re my family .
i &apos;m asking you ...
please don &apos;t make me leave my family .
i &apos;ll move to new york .
you won &apos;t regret this .
i know i won &apos;t .
i promise i &apos;m gonna give you the best life .
we &apos;re gonna be a new york power couple .
law by day , love by night .
and when we have kids , world , watch out .
sazs @-@ litts , they &apos;re gonna be ridiculous .
wait , what ?
i mean , let &apos;s face it . our kids ?
they hit the genetic lottery .
louis , i don &apos;t want kids .
what ?
they don &apos;t get me .
what ? i mean , what-- what are you talking about ?
i don &apos;t like kids .
i like when they &apos;re 22 and going to law school ,
but i just ...
those would be adults .
exactly .
no , no , no .
you may think that now , but when it actually happens ,
when--when they &apos;re yours , it &apos;s so--
louis , i &apos;m never gonna think that , ever .
how can you--
how can i what ?
it &apos;s who i am .
sheila , i &apos;m gonna be a father .
louis , we &apos;re so happy .
we can be happy .
just us .
i was willing to give up harvard for you .
you can &apos;t give up something for me ?
well ?
call her .
call her and apologize .
