today &apos;s safety film don &apos;t wear jewelry during sports
has been cancelled .
instead we &apos;ll watch a movie that made me fall in love
with showing movies i &apos;ve watched to other people .
that &apos;s right , the 1967 classic
doctor dolittle , which answers the question :
what if an elderly unmarried doctor
decided to focus his practice on animals ?
the running time is 152 minutes !
the running time is now !
he &apos;s been giving that horse an eye exam forever .
it &apos;s a carrot , stupid !
isn &apos;t it a pity you &apos;re a seal ?
that dude &apos;s making it with a fish !
i kissed a light socket once , and i woke up in a helicopter .
* this is the world of dr. dolittle *
* the wonderful world of dr. dolittle *
this is anthony newley at his worst .
* where crocodiles talk *
* and elephants sing *
* and animals do most any old thing *
* my friend the doctor *
* and me *
that movie was so bad , it actually stinks .
whoa , it &apos;s not the movie .
it &apos;s bart !
i don &apos;t stink .
you &apos;re just smelling the old boogers in your noses .
you got to pick those things-- it &apos;s called hygiene .
if i may join in the mockery ,
lisa simpson also has an appalling odor .
what ? i don &apos;t smell .
girls don &apos;t smell !
sorry , girl , but you smell .
stink @-@ sons ! stink @-@ sons !
stink @-@ sons ! stink @-@ sons !
children can be so cruel .
stink @-@ son ! stink @-@ son !
then they called me stink @-@ son .
that &apos;s not even my name .
what happened ?
our family &apos;s been ostracized for lots of things ,
but never our hygiene .
rarely our hygiene .
never my hygiene !
i think i know
where the smell is coming from .
mold .
it &apos;s worse than a grampa hug in the summer .
i thought smelly clothes only happened
to working mothers .
this is all the money i &apos;ve found
in homer &apos;s pants pockets over the years .
i was saving it to buy a spice rack
instead of always renting one .
but i guess we &apos;ll have to spend this money
on a new washing machine .
we cannot continue on as the stink @-@ sons .
oh , stink @-@ sons !
when i return , we will no longer
have to wear attic clothes .

smoked meat .
move it , fat ass !
i &apos;m trying to text !
oh , i spilled my pee jar !
watch it , stink @-@ son !
a roadside barbecue stand ?
everything tastes better when it &apos;s near a road .
try a taste .
guaranteed to blow your mouth &apos;s mind .
oh , look at &apos; em go !
ooh , charred and moist !
like satan &apos;s burps .
the grill marks are shaped like a honeycomb !
that &apos;s why i call her the hive .
she &apos;s been passed down through my family for generations .
they say the hive &apos;s made from a meteor ...
which burned off my great @-@ grandpappy &apos;s beard ,
exposing his weak chin to the entire township .
it was a gift from the heavens .
the perfect smoker .
the hive has never been cooled down ,
never been cleaned .
mixing meat , fat and smoke into pure magic .
smoked me .
you look like a man who needs a smoker in his life .
it just so happens that the hive
is available for purchase .
but why would you give up your most prized possession ?
that &apos;d be like stephen hawking selling his talking motorcycle .
my old lady and i are saving up to live our dream
of moving further away from our grandchildren .
but if i don &apos;t come home
with a washing machine , my wife will be so mad .
oh , should i do the thing i &apos;m supposed to do
or the thing everybody knows i &apos;m gonna do ?
you bought a grill ? !
it &apos;s not a grill .
it &apos;s a smoker .
that you can grill on .
that money was supposed to de @-@ stink our children ,
and instead you bought a ... doo @-@ hickey
to stuff your greedy face .
don &apos;t worry , homer .
nothing fixes bad times like good food .
also , i died .
i can &apos;t believe you cooked this .
well , the secret to barbecue
is sitting around doing nothing .
no wonder i &apos;m great at it .
smoky carrot .
and , maggie , this is for you .
come on , just one bite .
nah @-@ uh !
uh @-@ huh .
never !
ever .
forget it .
remember it .
no way , jose !
si way , josefina .
nothin &apos; doing .
everythin &apos; undoing .
oh , fine ! one bite .
homie , i finally understand gluttony .
welcome to america , baby .
sorry for dropping by ,
but we smelled your barbecue and couldn &apos;t resist .
here &apos;s some carl @-@ slaw to go with it .
i call it &quot; carl @-@ slaw , &quot; because i bought it .
look how popular we are .
that smoker is the best thing that ever happened to us .
thank goodness for your selfish choices .
i make them all for you .
yeah , i &apos;m looking for a barbecue bozo name of homer simpson ?
whoa , that &apos;s chew network &apos;s celebrity chef scotty boom !
he &apos;s the host of side dish impossible ,
master prison chef and kill it , chill it , grill it .
yeah , how you doing , everybody ?
i &apos;m scotty boom ,
and i &apos;m challenging you to an eat @-@ down !
what &apos;s that-- some kind of eat @-@ down ?
it &apos;s my new show where i use
my big @-@ time new york city chef skills
to obliterate amateur cooks .
who would watch such a one @-@ sided farce ?
i &apos;m in .
this eat @-@ down &apos;s gonna throw down
at the springfield barbecue festival .
and when i &apos;m done , you &apos;re gonna wish you never heard of food !
buy my cookware !
i &apos;m competing against scotty boom !
he &apos;s got what all great chefs have--
yelling .
homer ! homer ! homer !
you were right , greasy hobo .
nothing fixes bad times like good food .
up here , i can watch
anyone in the world take a shower .
okay , pork , i &apos;m gonna throw you
in that magic smoker for 24 hours
and win that cook @-@ off .
i only wish you could be alive to see it .
then i suppose
this is my last chance to say
i love you .
oh , no !
our smoker &apos;s been stolen !
why ? !
and when ? !
you didn &apos;t lock it up ?
you fat idiot !
i &apos;m out of here .
you &apos;ll find the hive , right ?
tell me you &apos;ll find my smoker !
ah , don &apos;t you worry .
the springfield pd is on the case .

uh , well , i wouldn &apos;t get your hopes up .
high @-@ end barbeques like yours are easy pickings .
smokeheads grab them at night , clean them up .
next thing you know ,
it &apos;s cooking another family &apos;s hot dogs .
humanity-- what a joke .
so , it &apos;s gone .
it &apos;s really gone .
all that &apos;s left is the smell of burning hickory
and four tiny little wheel prints .
good night , sweet prints .
so you lost your grill .
snap out of it , you big fat baby .
son , this is so much more
than just losing an outdoor cooking device .
how to explain this to a child ?
this is the death of hope .
what are you talking about ?
everything good that comes into our lives ,
the universe takes away .
so from now on , i &apos;m just gonna lie here
and never care again .
come on , you know your life sucks .
just get drunk like you always do .
i don &apos;t want to .
look at him .
he &apos;s lying there like a beached whale
waiting to explode .
maybe we should try to track down that smoker .
i don &apos;t know .
the whole barbequing scene is pretty pro @-@ meat .
and all that smoke pollutes the environment .
this isn &apos;t about your boyfriend , the planet .
i &apos;ve never seen him this beaten down .
okay , look for clues .
are there any mud samples we can trace
to local heaths and moors ?
sorry , i &apos;ve been watching a lot of sherlock .
knock it off , boy .
i don &apos;t have any meat for you .
get down !
wait !
santa &apos;s little helper was in the yard last night
when the smoker was stolen , but he didn &apos;t make a peep .
why ?
&quot; natural peanut butter . &quot;
what if someone gave this to the dog
so he &apos;d be licking instead of barking
while they took the smoker ? !
you got a clue , boy !
a clue !
who &apos;s a smart dog ?
who &apos;s a smart dog ?
you &apos;re watching
eat @-@ down with scotty boom .
come on , homie .
we can &apos;t let this empire state jabroni beat us .
this week i took on the gilbert family of portland , maine .
they &apos;ve been making clam chowder for generations .
how is that better than something i spent a day on ?
i win !
manhattan chowder , baby !
nyc !
greatest city , greatest chowder !
the gilbert family has learned a valuable lesson--
screw everything .
dad , we &apos;re gonna find that smoker !
to try is to fail !
there &apos;s only one store in town
that sells all @-@ natural peanut butter .

don &apos;t worry , i know how to talk to these people .
thank goodness you have organic fennel .
the fennel at the farmer &apos;s market is only transitional .
typical .
small farmers ruining it for the really small farmers .
so , could you maybe tell me
who bought this brand of peanut butter ?
oh , excuse me , i &apos;m sorry .
you want me to violate my customers &apos; privacy ?
who are you working for ?
the nsa ? big pharma ?
amazon prime ?
tell us ! tell us ! tell us ! tell us !
my hoops !
my ridiculous flesh hoops !
there !
someone &apos;s ringing up peanut butter .
nelson !
what are you playing there , nelson ?
clash of castles ?
so what if it is ?
your castle &apos;s pretty well @-@ defended .
level six catapults .
level seven sorcerers .
maxed @-@ out trolls .
uh , yeah , well .
yeah , gets the job done .
i tell you , those are some nice upgrades .
expensive upgrades .
upgrades like that cost gems .
and gems cost cash .
expensive cash .
where &apos;d you get the cash , nelson ?
i don &apos;t use gems !
i &apos;m a grinder ! a grinder !
what are they ?
they &apos;re like televisions ...
but they just keep going !
he &apos;s meeting with someone .
that &apos;s always a sign of guilt .
hope you don &apos;t mind .
i cooked some dinner on it .
ah , smell you later .
this is our chance .
hot ! hot !
hot !
hot ! hot ! hot ! hot ! hot !
hot ! hot ! hot ! hot !
the universe does hate us .
it feels good to surrender .
good girl , maggie .
give up young .
get up off that floor !
we are on a head @-@ to @-@ head cook @-@ off
that &apos;ll be shown on tv and probably some planes .
we don &apos;t have the smoker .
just let us forfeit with dignity .
we still have to try .
this isn &apos;t a family of quitters .
sure we are .
we always have been and more so now .
i &apos;m a quitter .
and i &apos;ll back down to anyone who says i &apos;m not .
come on , buddhists aren &apos;t quitters .
actually , mom , buddhism is really
just quitting in yoga pants .
this is a live strong bracelet .
lance armstrong never quit .
he never quit the tour de france .
he never quit lying about his steroid use .
and he still hasn &apos;t totally come clean .
now get in the car !
eat @-@ down ! eat @-@ down ! eat @-@ down ! yee @-@ haw !
i can handle this barbeque competition .
all i need is a little help from an old friend .
i &apos;m alton brown
and welcome to eat @-@ down !
today scotty boom takes on the simpsons in ...
and i can tell you this-- it will be edited
to be dramatic .
marge , do you think your meat
has what it takes to win this eat @-@ down ?
it sure does .
homer , what about you ?
no way in hell .
what about you kids ?
are you pumped up to beat scotty boom ?
happiness is an illusion .
what she said .
looks like the simpsons are playing
mind games with you , scotty .
are you feeling the pressure ?
no pressure .
i &apos;m throwing down the taste of new york .
my recipe &apos;s infused with times square , the bronx zoo
and the sex and the city walking tour .
the simpsons better bring their a game .
f ! f game !
i call this my never @-@ give @-@ up brisket .
the secret ingredient is hope .
how many spices did you put in this ?
all of them .
i &apos;ve never seen such unusual grill marks .
this pattern looks like a honeycomb .
what ?
that meat was cooked on the hive !
this garlic @-@ sucking tunnel trash stole our smoker !
ah , this little flyover &apos;s crazy .
i cooked that meat myself right here over here .
the grill marks don &apos;t match .
dead meat doesn &apos;t lie .
scotty boom , you are hereby banned
from the chew network .
you are no longer a celebrity chef .
you &apos;re just a chef .
take him away , chief .
grand theft smoker .
sounds like a crime to me .
apparently , the winner of the eat @-@ down
is the simpsons .
isn &apos;t this a little too easy ?
why would a professional chef cheat ?
and how does nelson fit in ?
and where the heck is our smoker ?
that &apos;s the ringtone from the scrapyard !
get him !
bones ! bones !
i &apos;m covered in death !
my hoops !
dad , stop him !
i &apos;m done trying .
dad , please ! no one &apos;s asking you to care .
just trip a stranger !
a kid ?
why &apos;d you steal our smoker ?
why &apos;d you frame scotty boom ?
&apos;cause he &apos;s my dad .
i &apos;m tyler boom .
my dad is so busy shooting his tv shows
and going to the openings and closings
of his restaurants ...
i never see him .
you destroyed your dad &apos;s career
so he &apos;d spend more time with you ?
i met this kid nelson
playing clash of castles online .
you know , i knew my dad was coming to your town ,
so i hired nelson to take your smoker .
and then my nanny cooked some meat on it
and switched it so it looked like my dad cheated .
this was the only way .
the only way i thought of .
son , why didn &apos;t you tell me i was a terrible father ?
because i &apos;m from new york .
we don &apos;t talk about our feelings , huh ?
yeah , i understand , son .
i &apos;m from new york , too .
fdr drive .
the west side highway .
investment banking .
the gallery scene .
knicks suck .
oh , papa !
they suck so hard !
one more thing , tyler .
where &apos;s the hive ?
you &apos;re always so much hotter than i think you &apos;re gonna be .
thanks , guys , for not giving up , then giving up ,
then not giving up again , then i forget .
bbq is like family--
the cheap cuts of meat that nobody wants .
but if you treat them right ,
they turn into the best thing in the world .
yeah , barbecue &apos;s yummy .
chinese is pretty good , too .
meh , it depends on the place .
