You liked the tile
and the master bedroom suite?
And you like the way the French doors open out to the deck?
Yes, I love everything so far.
I especially love that I didn't have to do anything.
Meow.
Meow. That's right, Zola.
That's what a cat says.
Honestly, when the house is done,
just bring me out for the big reveal.
You want a big reveal?
I want a big reveal.
Rawr!
Good, Zola. Rawr. That's what a lion says.
Is that a...
That's a lion.
We have a phrase in the operating room,
"Don't pet the lion."
It means,
no matter how nice a tumor looks,
how small it is,
how perfect its margins may be...
Cristina,
it's been a week.
At some point, we have to talk.
It's still a tumor.
It's still dangerous
and it can bite.
It'll be weird at first.
Believe me, you'll feel like an idiot.
But the words can give you closure and strength.
So I want you each later
to find a private moment and just say the words aloud--
I am a widow.
Gretchen?
It was just so sudden.
Jason was fine, and then one day,
they said he had some blockages,
minor congestive heart failure,
and then he died, and I--
I'm--I'm sorry.
But blockages with congestive heart failure?
I mean, do you want to know what that really means?
Your husband's arteries were clogged.
I mean, he probably was lucky he lasted as long as he did,
because his heart was working overtime to pump enough blood
to his brain, let alone the rest of his body,
which ate away the heart muscle
till the ventricular wall was paper thin
and barely contracting.
Because, just to be clear,
there is no such thing
as minor congestive heart failure.
A patient with symptoms that severe?
They're-- they're-- they're a dead man walking.
A lion? An actual lion?
Looking at me like I was lunch.
Are you sure it wasn't a mountain lion
or... maybe a well-fed cat?
I was staring at Simba.
Grey, you're on my service.
Hey.
I-I saw a lion today,
walking across the street.
Derek and I were coming back from the house,
and it was just standing there in the street.
Cristina's not talking to me.
Okay, how come no one is concerned about the fact
that I saw a lion walking around Seattle?
Sorry. I was just, uh--
You can't force Cristina to open up.
You have to just let her come to you.
In the meantime, look at this.
Animal control came.
One dart, and he was down.
It walked across the road, right in front of us.
I feel like Julia and I are at a crossroads.
It's been five months.
Maybe it's time to take the next step
and ask her to move in.
Did you hear what I said?
It was a lion.
You like Julia, right?
Dr. Webber.
Don't you have a gallbladder scheduled for this morning?
Hendricks is doing it.
You heard about the lion mauling.
Came down here to claim it before anybody else
could get their hands on it.
I am down here for those in need, Avery.
I am here to be of service to human kind.
Yeah, well, you could be of service to human kind
in O.R. Three with that gallbladder.
Try it, son.
Try and challenge me.
35-year-old male, body covered in claw marks
and an arm that looks like a chew toy.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. My arm.
I can't feel my arm.
Don't worry. I'm gonna take care of you.
So am I.
Naomi. What happened to Naomi?
Did the lion eat my girlfriend?
These wounds are deep. Avery,
page Sloan and Torres.
Or you can page Sloan and Torres.
Well, somebody page Sloan and Torres right now!
32-year-old female, nasty bites to the neck,
and her abdomen's been eviscerated.
Kirby. Where's Kirby?
Ma'am, my name is Dr. Bailey.
You are at the hospital.
Transferring on one, two, three.
Okay, I need to look at this neck.
What about Kirby?
All right, let's call for an O.R. and page Hunt.
I need to know if Kirby's okay. Did he get hurt?
Um, can you also find out the status
of the gentleman who came in with her?
No, no. That's Paul. I want to know about Kirby,
My lion.
So what, it--it escaped, like from the zoo?
No, someone's house. The thing was a pet.
What?
Yeah.
I went to a grief group.
Ew. You went to a grief group?
Callie.
You went to a grief group. Yay.
No, not "Yay."
Bad.
Dr. Altman,
I'm ready to get started on your stem cell project.
See? I mean, who needs a grief group?
I am doing cutting-edge stem cell research.
I-I'm looking toward the future,
not dwelling on the past. Right?
Sorry to interrupt.
Um, it's my last day, and, um,
I just wanted to say good-bye.
Well, it's been great working with you.
Good luck back East.
Good-bye.
Bye.
Is it okay if I give you a hug?
Why wouldn't it be okay?
Um, yeah, of course it is. Come here, Colleen.
Give me a hug.
I think he grew. Doesn't he look longer?
Sure. He's gonna play hoops.
I'm serious. You should measure him.
He shot up an inch overnight.
I-I gotta change his dressing.
You changed his dressing, like, an hour ago.
Please measure him.
I'm using my puppy dog eyes.
He needs a new tape measure.
I need off this case.
Put Kepner on it or something.
This is about the lion, isn't it?
You want to go see the victims.
I don't blame you.
All right. Go on. Go get a look and then come back.
Oh, and take pictures while you're there.
This isn't about the lion. This is about Morgan.
She's in-into me.
Karev, we work with sick kids
and then we develop close relationship with their parents.
It's normal. You just need to deal with it.
And you-- you put up boundaries.
I'm trying, but she acts like we're, you know...
I-I can't be this kid's doctor, okay?
Alex, he smiled.
You gotta come see. He--he's smiling.
Oh, okay.
You want off my service, you can be off my service.
But, Alex,
you better mean it.
I mean it.
Okay.
I mean it.
The patient's belly is ripped open.
Spleen and intestines are exposed.
What happened?
She has a lion for a pet is what happened.
It tried to eat her and then it got away
and it probably tried to eat other people
because it is a lion.
Who has a lion living in their house?
I'll tell you who has a lion living in their house--
a crazy person does.
Now because she's crazy
doesn't mean she doesn't deserve excellent care.
In fact, we're going to save that crazy lady's life
just so I can tell her she's crazy.
Got it?
Told you I saw a lion.
I know you know.
Is this about Cristina again?
She walks away every time I try to talk to her,
so just let her know how sorry I am.
I wish I could take it back.
If I could--it-- it was just sex.
Just stop.
I would love to stop.
I mean, I don't relish discussing
my own personal failings with you, but--
We're going to pretend this conversation never happened.
Okay?
Meredith--
No. I mean it.
Damn it. Now I have to scrub again.
Do you know anything about Arizona
and that nurse Colleen?
Were they a thing before she met me?
Ortho nurse Colleen?
Yeah. There was a good-bye hug that lingered too long.
That would explain it.
I been trying to get her naked for three years.
Anyway, she never said anything,
and I-I work with Colleen every day.
Do you think she has other exes here in the hospital?
Probably.
Oh, quit it. Stop thinking about the hot ortho nurse.
Wait. You... you think she's hot?
I-I could see it in those eyes.
Those eyes said, "You are meat."
And in that moment, I believed him.
What happened then?
Then he lunged, and I just reacted.
I shoved my arm right into his mouth.
Who the hell who does that?
Who the hell feeds himself to a lion?
I'm kinda wondering the same thing.
What do we got?
Deep animal claw laceration extending down
the left side of the body.
And there's your arm.
Yeah, that's what you expect when you hear "lion."
I bet it's nice to know what to expect
instead of showing up at your girlfriend's house for the first time
And being greeted at the door by the freakin' king of the jungle.
She never bothered to mention she had a pet lion?
Seems like something that ought to come up on a first date.
Right? She told me she had a cat--
A big cat-- and I'm allergic,
so I took an antihistamine before I left the house.
Oh, yeah. You shoulda brought a bull whip.
So I dissect out and remove the animal cadaver hearts.
Then I insert them with the catheters
and begin injecting them with the solvent.
Correct. And why do we do that?
To drain the hearts of their existing cardiac cells
so all that's left is their extracellular matrix.
Like stripping a house down to its frame only.
We are scrubbing away cells of hearts, Cristina,
actual hearts.
We are wiping them clean,
'till they're blank.
And then in theory,
when we inject them with stem cells...
They'll live again.
Let's grow ourselves some new hearts.
Dr. Altman, I-- I traded with Kepner.
I'm on your service today.
Are you up on my patients?
Karev? Karev, can you focus?
Yeah. Sorry.
Oh, that's the E.R. Let's go.
Happy scrubbing.
You immobilize the aneurysm and place the clip.
Wait. I'm clipping the aneurysm?
What if it ruptures?
I-I clip proximal and distal to the aneurysm.
What if you damage the perforating vessels?
I throw a temporary clip on the parent artery.
It's okay if you don't want me to do it.
I-I know that I- I really messed up last week.
Yes, you did.
But you're still a student,
and this is how you learn.
Any other questions?
Are you gonna tell Mark to move in with Julia?
I mean, what do they even really talk about?
You know, she sews eyeballs for a living. It's gross.
I mean, plus, she has really thin hair,
which can be a-a sign of early menopause.
We don't talk about stuff like this.
We don't talk about stuff like this.
I will see you in pre-op.
You're not using the oil.
Alex uses his oil when Tommy's distressed.
It keeps him from desaturating.
His sats are really low. I don't think the oil is--
Just use the oil.
Can we page Dr. Robbins?
No, page Dr. Karev. Alex--
Page Robbins now!
Can you describe the pain?
I don't know. It just, uh...
It's like a...
It--it's crushing me
and I can't shake it.
Hand me the E.K.G.
It looks like anterolateral M.I..
We almost didn't come in.
We're only in town till tomorrow.
We're catching a cruise for Alaska.
Mr. Carroll, you're experiencing a heart attack.
We need to take you up to the cath lab
for an angioplasty.
Can you tell me what you were doing
when you felt the chest pain?
We just went out to walk around our bed and breakfast.
And it was like a piano fell
onto my chest.
So you were walking.
You weren't running or anything else
that might have triggered the pain?
Well...
We saw a lion.
So that was a little awkward.
Don't you think, that thing with Colleen?
How she was-- she got so emotional.
Almost seems like you guys were a thing.
Yeah, she gets like that.
Oh, really?
She gets like that, like you know how she gets,
like you were a thing?
Callie.
What? It's not... What? I'm just asking.
It's not a big deal.
Oh, we were. We were a...a little bit of a thing
a very long time ago.
Seems like something you would've mentioned.
Well, it didn't even occur to me.
Have you dated other people in the hospital
it hasn't occurred to you to tell me about?
Okay, you know what? We're not doing this.
No, it's totally fine.
I mean, I'll tell you about my exes.
I know about your exes.
Not all of them. You don't know about Karev.
Karev. I know about Karev.
Look, just give me a number. Ballpark.
What, five? Ten? A hundred?
Okay, that's the NICU. I have to go.
No, no, no, no, no. You can't just go.
I'm sorry, but the babies, they need me, so...
Arizona--
Oh, I'm sorry. Wait. Wait. Wh--
"Dr. Robbins, please help us."
Just--just give me a number.
Just give me a number. Just give me a number.
One or two, okay?
That's--that's it.
One or two.
That's not so bad.
Maybe she should've gotten a dog.
A dog fetches balls.
Maybe, you know, a rascally dog.
He chews shoes.
But he doesn't eviscerate your spleen.
Yeah, and don't say it's because you love lions so much.
If you love lions,
you wouldn't want it to live in your home.
You would want that lion to roam freely
in the jungle with other lions
where they can eviscerate the spleens of...
gazelles.
That's what lions eat, gazelles?
I think I saw that on a show
where they were chasing a herd of gazelles.
Have I offended someone?
'Cause it's awfully quiet in here.
Well, don't tell me you own
an exotic pet that I don't know about.
Grey, you living with a monkey?
Please don't tell me you're living with a monkey.
No. No monkeys.
Uh, Hunt?
No. Cristina doesn't believe in pets.
Cristina doesn't believe in a lot of things.
Okay, then.
Suction.
I'm sorry. Explain it again?
During the angioplasty,
Mr. Carroll had another heart attack.
We placed a balloon pump to stabilize him,
but that only buys us a little time.
They're gonna have to do surgery, Emma.
But he--he's going to be okay?
If we can perform a coronary artery bypass soon,
I'm hopeful that we've caught it in time.
I am so sorry, Em.
You've been waiting for this trip 50 years.
This cruise was a... gift
from our kids for our anniversary.
And now I've messed it all up.
You didn't mess anything up.
You wanted to see those humpback whales so bad.
Forget the whales.
We came face-to-face with a lion.
Yes, we did.
It's already a heck of a vacation.
Yes, it is.
Happy anniversary, Martin.
Say that to me tomorrow.
Make sure his labs are up to date,
and then we'll take him up to pre-op.
What is wrong with you?
I-I know--I know that we don't...
We don't talk about this stuff.
Okay? But I-I kinda need to talk about this stuff,
because what if I don't and then I miss an opportunity
to appeal to my big brother about, you know, what--
what if Mark is my soul mate?
I am not your best friend right now, Lexie.
I am not your big brother. I am your attending,
and what I need is my resident.
You're right.
I'm sorry. I...
I am your resident.
Good. Make sure our patient is prepped.
You have an aneurysm to clip.
We came to see the hearts.
Oh, this blows.
Yang's growing organs,
and I'm stuck patching up grandpa.
Is that Morgan again?
Why don't you just answer her already?
I've gotta be a dead frickin' mouse.
Cold and dead, okay?
I mean, that's what she needs.
All day, I'm trying to back off,
and all she does is--
See?
Hey, you can do this.
All right? You are good at being a douche,
and that's just, what, one step away from being cold and dead?
I mean, right, Yang?
See what she's doing?
That's what you need to do.
Do that. Do what she's doing.
Hey, did you guys hear about a lion lady?
Yeah. Her boyfriend was the appetizer,
and he wanted mommy for dinner.
I feel bad for her.
Okay, she's just a girl with a pet.
You know, she probably had some nice friends once,
and maybe even a nice guy.
And then those friends moved away.
The guy started living with somebody else,
and then her family probably abandoned her...
leaving her alone to rot in an attic somewhere with her cat,
her big jungle cat,
who was sitting in the corner,
just licking his paws,
just wanting to eat her stupid face off.
Look, this is a scientific lab, not a lunchroom,
so everyone out right now.
Cold and dead.
Tommy's contrast study shows
That his sepsis is due to an ileocolic fistula.
So do the surgery.
He has a bleed, and he's developed
a post-hemorrhagic hydrocephalus.
He has R.O.P.
He's at risk for cerebral palsy,
blindness, deafness,
inability to walk or feed himself,
cognitive disabilities--
I don't see how this surgery changes that.
It doesn't, but it's invasive.
I mean, there's a chance it won't work,
and he'll need more surgeries.
Yeah, I know that.
I have been here dealing with this for a while.
I-I know more about this stuff than you do.
Where--where is Alex?
He's on another case.
I think that you need to consider your other option.
If we don't escalate care...
have they taught you what A.N.D. means yet?
Allowing natural death.
We're--we're not-- we're not there yet.
Things are deteriorating significantly.
You--you think that's what I should do?
I think that you need to consider
what kind of life you want for your son.
Is it okay for him to be in pain every day?
Is it okay if he needs a feeding tube
for the rest of his life?
Is it okay if he can't run,
climb, or crawl?
If you want the surgery, we'll do it.
But if you decide
that enough is enough,
then we'll support that choice, too.
Arizona just taught me what A.N.D. is.
I guess my med school education's not dead yet.
Imagine...
the power it takes to cause injuries like these.
A flick of your wrist, and whoosh.
Nope. You know what these injuries are?
This is natural selection at work.
I mean, the guy was an idiot.
I don't care how desperate you are for sex,
if a chick tells you she wants you to meet her cat,
you run... fast.
He was blindsided by someone he trusted.
You never know how you're gonna react when that happens.
What did you say to Robbins?
Hmm? Oh, nothing.
I just asked her how many other exes she has in the hospital.
She said one or two. I can live with one or two, right?
What was that? Why did he cough?
Don't say anything. We're not in this.
Webber, why'd you cough?
Oh, um, well, it's--
It's a little like when a patient tells you
they have one or two drinks a-a week.
We all round that number up
because patients tend to tell us what we want to hear.
If they'll admit to two drinks...
They're having so many more.
Oh, I got--I got something sharp here.
A lion tooth.
All right.
Hey, hey, hey, don't just toss that aside just yet.
Boki, keep that safe, will you?
Mrs. Carroll, I'm on my way up to surgery now.
The grandkids want pictures of the lion,
but, oh...these damn phones make it so hard
to see the damn buttons.
May I?
There. It's sent.
Wow. You -- you guys really did get up close.
Martin faced a lion today.
He faced a lion
and he didn't get eaten.
He's not...
It's not his time, Dr. Altman.
Please don't make me a widow.
I don't want you to worry.
I am very good at my job.
Okay?
Watch the angle.
You're gonna clip the perforators.
No, no, stop.
Lexie, I'm sorry.
But I think I should do this.
Yeah, yeah. It's -- it's okay.
Um, next time.
I'm not gonna tell Mark what to do.
You're not?
They're gonna move in together either way.
The man has always been easy to read.
And the only thing that could change that
is if he knew he still had a shot with you.
Really?
He's happy with the eyeball doctor.
So make sure you want him back because you want him
not because he's with somebody else.
All right. The grafting is complete.
Let's wean him off bypass.
Dr. Karev, it's yours.
It's from a Morgan.
"Did you get my last text? Where are you?"
And then it says, "We need to talk!" All caps.
Is that the intern with the preemie?
Yep.
"You're ignoring me. You're a total..."
then there's a lot of strong language.
If you need to step away, just say so.
I'm fine. Are we warmed?
Yes, we are, doctor.
For what it's worth, I think you're doing the right thing.
She needs to figure out how to take care of herself
and her baby.
She's alone.
There is no time like the present to embrace it.
Turn it off. Please.
All right. Removing the aortic cross-clamp now.
I see some bleeding.
Damn it. The ventricle's ruptured.
3-0 prolene. Get in there with the suction, Karev.
Oh, come on, Martin. Come on. Damn it.
Meredith --
Hey, just don't talk to me. Okay?
She knew I would hate you,
but she didn't want me to hate you.
Do you know what that means?
It means she's planning to forgive you
or she's desperately trying to find a way to forgive you.
And it doesn't matter if it was just sex.
She didn't want me to know, okay?
And now I do, so don't.
All right. Give me a pledget.
Here you go.
Shouldn't we go back on bypass and patch it?
I mean, one slip, and this guy's as good as dead.
Then I better not slip. Okay, nobody breathe.
Okay. Cut it. Let's see if it worked.
I don't see any blood.
Crap. You did it.
I did, didn't I?
All right. Let's finish up.
Thank you.
Just so you know, she's tweaking about Colleen
and all the others.
Excuse me?
I tried to talk her down, but it could get ugly --
mauled by a lion ugly.
You talked to your ex about my exes?
Yeah. I wanted some input.
No. No, no, no. He does not get to have that input
on our love life.
Okay, excuse me.
Colleen was an ortho nurse.
I worked with her every day for two years,
and I had no idea that the two of you...
She's seen you naked.
Okay, fine.
What do you want to know?
I want names.
Her.
And her.
Mm. And her, over by the soda machine.
Yeah, twice.
Okay, that's Noelle. She's not even gay.
Well, she was that night.
Uh, also Nancy in path, uh, Meg in dermo,
Nurse Tia and her sister,
but, you know, not at the same time.
Can I get something for the pain?
Uh, you are maxed out on pain meds, buddy.
Of course I am.
I swear to god, Paul, you're such a wussy.
Oh, no one thinks that.
They should.
Naomi does.
Gotta be why she didn't tell me that Kirby was a lion.
She knew I would've freaked out.
We met on a dating site.
And when I saw her profile, she seemed...
so adventurous,
outdoorsy.
Maybe I misrepresented myself a little bit.
Pretended I was adventurous and outdoorsy.
When we met, I could tell she was disappointed.
But she stuck around,
trying to see if the...
guy I pretended to be was in here somewhere.
But when I shoved my arm
into Kirby's mouth
and I felt him chomp down,
I screamed.
I really, really screamed.
She knows the truth.
I am a...wussy.
Hang on. Kirby was going for her
and not you,
and you body blocked a lion?
Son, you are a hero.
You were the knight on the white horse
who stared into the dragon's jaws
and shoved his fist straight down the bastard's throat.
So... I saved her?
I'll tell you one thing,
there's no way I would've been able to do what you did.
Really?
Oh, yeah. Me-- I mean, me either.
You want to come talk to the wife?
You just want an audience while you do your victory lap.
You bet I do.
You're not even a-a little interested in why I know about A.N.D.?
It's 'cause I have to decide today if
I make Robbins operate on Tommy's fistula
or I just let him die.
I didn't know you were there already.
Yeah, 'cause you vaporized.
I'm sorry. I-I-I was in surgery.
He... he had such a good day yesterday.
I actually went online last night
and found a used crib,
and then this morning, it's like...
Why can't he just have a few good days in a row?
I don't know what to do. What--what am I supposed to do?
I think it's time for you to--
to consider the quality of life that you want to offer Tommy--
I don't need you to give me the friggin' party line, Alex.
I have Robbins for that.
I need you to tell me what to do.
It's not my decision.
Hey. Hey. Don't get all objective on me now.
It's not the time.
No, it is the time.
Look, I'm not his dad, I'm--I'm not your boyfriend,
and you can't rely on me to help you make this decision.
Wow. Really? Now?
In--in the worst moment of my life,
you want to make sure I understand we're not a couple?
Yeah, 'cause you know what?
This isn't the worst moment of your life.
The worst moment of your life is gonna be when Tommy dies,
or when he doesn't die and he's in pain and frustrated
because his body won't do what he wants it to do,
or his brain doe't work like the other kids' brains work,
and you're spending half your life going to the doctor's office.
So what if he's not perfect?
Why do you all people think that just because he's blind...
or impaired or--or not a freakin' doctor,
he's not worth something?
The point is, it doesn't matter what the rest of us think.
At the end of the day,
all that matters is what you think.
So decide--
That's what I'm trying to do.
No, you're not.
Look, you're standing at the nursery bawling,
looking at all the healthy babies,
feeling sorry for yourself.
Stop it.
Look, no one's saying that you didn't get dealt a crappy hand.
You did.
But now you've gotta deal with it.
You. Not me and you. You.
Hey.
Hey.
I brought you a treat.
Thanks.
Whatcha doin'?
Whole organ decellularization.
I-I wash the hearts with the solvent
for the next 12 hours, and then...
it drains them of their cells
so Teddy and I can reseed them.
So you're making new hearts from scratch.
Yeah. Kinda.
Cool.
Mrs. Carroll, I just wanted to tell you
that your husband's surgery went...
Mrs. Carroll, I'm sorry to wake you.
Mrs. Carroll? Mrs. Carroll?
Oh, no. Oh, no. I need a gurney.
Hey. We're doing the surgery.
But she doesn't want you involved.
Yeah.
Yeah. Let me know how it goes.
Hey.
You were a great doctor today.
He's gonna need a really tough mom.
And if hating you helps make her tough...
Yeah.
Naomi?
Naomi, I'm here. Don't try to move.
You have about a million stitches.
He's gone.
No, I'm right here.
I'm right beside you.
Kirby.
He's gone.
He's been my best friend for 15 years,
and now they're gonna take him away...
because of you.
I-I saved you.
He freaked out because you were screaming like a little bitch.
I was screaming ke a bitch
because he was going for your throat.
Uh, Dr. Avery and I are gonna
just let you two have some privacy.
My throat? Are you kidding me?
That's how Kirby plays.
That's how he hunts,
because he's a lion
living in a 2-bedroom townhome
when he should be roaming the frigging savanna.
That lion is braver than any of us.
You'd be dead if it weren't for me.
I-I'm a knight on a horse.
I slayed a dragon.
I am a hero, and we are so over.
That's disappointing.
But not surprising.
I mean, an idiot dating an idiot.
I have something I think you should see.
Come with me.
Oh, maybe. No.
What are you doing?
Trying to figure out how many dermatology fellows
my wife's banged.
For sure her.
Ooh, yeah, that one, probably, too.
Ooh. "Specializes in complete body rejuvenation."
Yeah, I bet you do, Cheryl.
You gotta get over it. Everybody's got a past.
Look, I'm fine with her having a past.
It's just, I-I didn't know I was working with it,
and operating with it, seeing it in the cafeteria.
That woman wakes up every day,
sees my face in her kitchen holding her kid,
the kid that you and I...
made together.
Yeah, I guess...
I guess that can't be easy for her.
Easy? Knowing you've been with the golden boy of this hospital?
Woman's in hell, Torres.
Okay.
I'm a god.
It's killing her.
The nurse said your surgery was flawless,
That now I have the heart of a 50 year old.
Thank you, Dr. Altman.
Martin--
Where's Emma?
Did you tell her yet?
When your surgery was finished...
I went to look for your wife in the waiting room.
I thought that she had fallen asleep,
So I tried to wake her, but...
Oh, no.
We performed C.P.R..
I tried to resuscitate her myself,
But she...
She didn't make it.
They pronounced her dead a few minutes ago in the E.R..
I am so sorry.
Oh... no.
N-not--not Emma.
No.
She died?
Yes.
Emma's dead?
Yes.
She's gone?
Yes, Martin.
Emma is dead.
Oh, Emma.
Emma.
Oh, God, Emma.
Oh, no. No.
No, no. No.
Uh, Bailey.
I'm sorry about before.
You... didn't need to see that.
Oh, I didn't see anything.
We both know that you did.
Now you and I are scheduled for a Whipple tomorrow.
I know that Cristina is one of your own,
so I understand if you prefer that I not scrub in with you.
I won't pretend
to understand the thing
you and Cristina have going on,
but I do know that, uh,
affairs don't happen in a vacuum.
You're human and you made a human mistake.
You did a terrible thing.
It doesn't mean you're a terrible person.
We've all heard the warnings...
and we've ignored them.
I am...
I am a widow.
I am...
a widow.
I am a w--
Lobby?
Lobby.
Parking lot?
Parking lot.
Uh, you know what?
I, um, I forgot that I have some charting to do.
So... have a great night.
We push our luck.
Each and every one of these items
was removed from a patient.
Christmas lights? Come on.
Where would you--
You don't want to know.
How did you--
Very, very carefully.
Ohh. Okay.
It's pretty great, right?
Actually...
yeah.
Well, sometimes we have geniuses on our table
and sometimes we have idiots.
I for one
am partial to the idiot.
You don't get a lion's tooth from a genius.
We roll the dice.
Okay. Hey, here's the thing--
I do know about your exes,
and frankly, sometimes it sucks.
Okay.
And you know, I mean, I don't--I don't like knowing,
and sometimes, you know, it--it drives me crazy.
I know.
So maybe there's a reason, you know, there's a--
there's a very good reason that I was--
I wasn't telling you about my exes.
You know, I was trying to spare you.
Yeah, I understand.
You do?
Yeah, I do.
Okay, 'cause I thought we were fighting.
Oh, we totally are.
We play with fire.
Look what daddy got you today, Zola.
Ooh, roar.
Rawr.
And now put your head down. Oh, there it is.
Oh, well. Roar.
Don't do that.
Well, you think it's cute when Zola does it.
What is it?
If you ever cheat on me, I'll kill you.
Okay.
I mean it.
Okay.
Say it.
I will never cheat on you.
You want to talk about it?
No.
Okay.
It's human nature--
when we're told not to touch something...
Rawr.
We usually do,
even if we know better.
Maybe because
deep down...
