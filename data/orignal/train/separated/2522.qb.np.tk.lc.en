well , it wasn &apos;t easy , but we managed to watch
every &quot; testicle fail &quot; video on the internet .
now to leave a great comment .
lol .
that &apos;s gotta hurt .
oh ... i guess there &apos;s nothing left to do
but go outside and play .
wait-- a sponsored link .

a trailer for project : after party .
the long @-@ awaited sequel to project : party .
that &apos;s a red band trailer .
请核实您的年龄
we &apos;re not old enough to see that .
sure we are . i just have to enter my birthday .
january 1 , 1900 .
no movie &apos;s so dirty the oldest man in the world can &apos;t see it .
well , they did everything they could to stop us ,
but we hacked through anyway .
they thought the party was over .
after party !
brief nudity !
i thought we installed parental blocking software
on all our computers .
i don &apos;t know what that stuff blocks .
mammogram appointment .
i told you to clean your room
and instead you &apos;re watching chest videos .
look at all those bowls of half @-@ eaten cereal .
the cereal on the bottom gets soggy .
i know how cereal works . now clean your room .
why should i ? it &apos;s just gonna get dirty again .
i &apos;m in charge . you do what i say .
i &apos;ll get to it when i get to it .
that better not mean what it means when i say it .
d &apos;oh !
that boy has no respect for my authority .
maybe you two are more similar than you &apos;d like to admit .
we &apos;re not similar .
i love being told what to do by someone
who &apos;s wise in the ways of the world . love it !
here &apos;s what i would do : in the middle of the night ,
clean bart &apos;s room for him ,
then , in the morning , thank him for cleaning his room .
you poor woman .
dealing with bart
has turned your mind to ketchup water .
you rest . i &apos;ll be the boy &apos;s father now .
i &apos;m done .
i &apos;d like it if you ate a little more broccoli .
eh , i &apos;m not feelin &apos; it .
your mother said eat your broccoli .
why do i need to eat broccoli ?
so that you can grow up healthy and strong , like ...
randy quaid . yeah , randy quaid .
he &apos;s very healthy .
look , i &apos;ll drink another glass of milk .
milk . that &apos;s for babies
and old guys who can &apos;t sleep at night
because of what they did in the war .
broccoli .
hey , what if i eat the broccoli ?
i love the stuff .
you eat a sundae . marge , get lisa a sundae .
you are not leaving this table
until you eat that broccoli .
and i &apos;m going to sit right here until you do .
you &apos;ll never out @-@ sit me .
oh , really ? you think your skinny butt
can sit on that hard , wooden chair longer than
el gordo ?
the sit is on .
eat your broccoli .
no .
eat your broccoli .
no .
eat your broccoli .
no .
they &apos;ve been at it all night .
i know , but they &apos;re not gonna
waste a whole saturday inside .
homer , where are you ? our fantasy football draft
is about to start .
today &apos;s our draft .
i &apos;ve got to pick a good fantasy team .
when i lost last year ,
they made me do something so humiliating ...
jeebus loves tebow .
and so the fat man caves .
if you need me , i &apos;ll be up in my room eating cereal .
half a bowl of cereal .
marge , i want you--
my wife-- to draft my fantasy football team .
i @-@ i don &apos;t really know that much about the ...
my team name is &quot; somewhere over the dwayne bowe &quot;
and my password is &quot; annoyed grunt . &quot;
draft with god , honey .
eat your broccoli .
martin &apos;s been secretly
taking self @-@ defense courses ,
and now he &apos;s beating up nelson .
his fat fists are a blur .
i &apos;ve never seen moves like that .
and never will again .
sounds like quite a match .
and here &apos;s your ticket to a front @-@ row seat .
no . no .
i &apos;ll never eat those filthy mini @-@ trees .
today , i wear the vest .
haw . haw .
now i am never eating that broccoli .
homie . homie , the fantasy draft just ended .
i got you five kickers .
it is called football , right ?
you are definitely eating that broccoli .
this has got to stop .
if you don &apos;t go to work , you &apos;re going to get fired .
i can get another job . who wouldn &apos;t want to hire
a man who won &apos;t back down ?
i could be a prison warden
or a southern anything .
i &apos;ve got an idea ,
but i &apos;ll need that broccoli .
these two fruit smoothies
look and taste exactly the same .
one of them , however , has the broccoli blended in .
bart picks one of the smoothies and drinks it--
maybe he had the broccoli , maybe he didn &apos;t .
no one knows , so neither of you has given in ,
and this horrible impasse can come to an end .
uh , works for me .
i &apos;m in .
oh , thank god .
oh , no , the broccoli .
you did that on purpose !
you lick this table clean !
come on . lick it .
come on , now , you can still lick it .
oh , i &apos;m afraid homer and bart &apos;s problems
are beyond our power to solve .
there &apos;s only one thing left to try .
and , lift .
put my sack back on . i &apos;m trying to sleep .
where are we ?
i don &apos;t know .
eat your broccoli .
no .
we &apos;re on an old @-@ time boat .
we &apos;ve been kidnapped .
not kidnapped , shanghaied .
my name is captain bowditch .
your wife signed you up for a week at sea ,
授权协议书
where you &apos;ll live like sailors , eat like sailors
and use therapeutic techniques to solve father @-@ son conflicts ...
like sailors .
for there &apos;s no better place
to solve relationship issues than on ...
the relation ship .
&quot; relation ship . &quot;
it works two ways .
pretty good .
pretty good .
hey , lame ass ,
thanks to you , we &apos;re stuck on a stupid therapy boat .
i &apos;m the lame ass ?
the only lame ass on this boat
is you and all the other lame asses !
shouldn &apos;t we do something ?
we are doing something .
we &apos;re empathizing .
i just know bart and homer are best friends already .
i can feel it .
ooh , i &apos;m getting a message from your father &apos;s
fantasy football league .
i must still be logged in as him .
侯默 你的队伍烂透啦
lenny used the &quot; uck &quot; word .
mom , it &apos;s trash talk .
you know how guys say mean things to their friends ,
the way women say nice things to their enemies .
yikes !
well i don &apos;t like this trash talk .
and i &apos;m gonna do something about it .
even if i have to bring in the big guns .
dear lord , please help homer &apos;s friends understand
that make @-@ believe computer football is no excuse
for using the internet to be mean .
我决定不看了
trash talk ?
in church ? no .
no , not here .
it &apos;s everywhere .
and now , a moment of silence
for the victims of the shelbyville sinkhole .
the wi @-@ fi . the wi @-@ fi . i &apos;ve got to take out the wi @-@ fi .
she &apos;s under a lot of stress .
her husband &apos;s at sea .
ahoy , lads and dads .
it &apos;s never easy to talk about
your feelings in front of strangers ...
so we &apos;re going to sing about them .
* who wants to sing about their feelings *
* who wants to go first and sing about their feelings *
* i &apos;ll go first and sing about my feelings *
* i &apos;m so happy to be singing . * now , homer .
so , cletus , gitmo ,
what brings you fellas to the relation ship ?
my daddy &apos;s always overpraisin &apos; me .
aw , that &apos;s great honesty , son .
i &apos;m so proud of you .
why won &apos;t you let me fail ?
what about you , bart , homer ? homer ?
lethargy , skin spots ,
spongy gums-- this man &apos;s got scurvy .
but we &apos;ve only been at sea one day .
when &apos;s the last time you had citrus ?
i had a mimosa at brunch a few years ago .
well , bart , while your father spends the next few days
sucking out of the lemon barrel ,
you &apos;ll drink deep of the hearty grog of empowerment .
what does that mean ?
mainly climbing .
except for wednesday night
when we project a movie on the sails .
but , really , a lot of climbing .
sheepshank , bowline , clove hitch ...
dad , look , i did a round turn with two half hitches .
you lie !
wait a minute .
windswept hair , rugged tan ,
rough , calloused hands .
you &apos;re enjoying this , aren &apos;t you ? !
so what if i am ?
you &apos;re my son and you will hate what i hate .
angled parking . lemons .
kickstarters by famous guys who already have lots of money .
and this boat !
i &apos;m old enough to choose my own things to hate .
and the things i like .
and i like being a sailor .
betrayed by my worst enemy .
i never would have seen it coming .
why , bart , that &apos;s a perfect halyard cleat .
just like you taught me , captain .
over , under , over , under , over ,
under , under , under , over , over ,
over , over , over , over , over ,
under , over , half hitch .
well , the standard form is under , over , under , over ,
under , under , under , under , under ,
over , over , under , under , under , under ,
around , over , over , under ...
fathers , sons ,
together we &apos;ve made a lot of progress on this voyage .
i learned that left is called &quot; port . &quot;
i finally got over my sea sickness .
terrific , homer . just terrific .
but one sailor has truly taken to nautical life .
i hereby award bart simpson the post of midshipman .
so now i can give orders ?
that &apos;s right , mr. midshipman .
wait a minute . i &apos;m his father .
he can &apos;t order me around .
he &apos;s your superior officer ,
so he can and will order you around .
and what if i refuse ?
i &apos;m sorry we had to discipline you .
on the positive side , you won &apos;t miss out
on the father / son hornpipe dance .
oh , i hate the golden age of sail .
officer on deck !
seaman homer , you &apos;re supposed to be swabbing the deck .
why should i ? it &apos;s just gonna get dirty again .
i &apos;m in charge . you do what i say .
fine . i &apos;ll swab whatever you say .
look ! i &apos;m swabbing the deck .
i &apos;m swabbing this giant tree that the sail grows out of .
ooh ! i &apos;m swabbing the top of the ocean .
ooh ! swab , swab , swab ...
hey ! what the ... ?
fantasy football has turned every man in this town
into a trash @-@ talking monster .
oh , face it-- all men live in a sad world
of profanity , boob jokes and tired comedy references .
&lt; i &gt; más &lt; / i &gt; cowbell !
&#91; 出自2000年 《 周六夜直播 》 的流行语 &#93;
there &apos;s only one thing that will shut these guys up .
you got to beat one of them at fantasy football .
then that &apos;s what i &apos;m gonna do .
game day .
as an icy mist rose
from a package of defrosting hamburger meat ,
desktop gladiator marge simpson
prepared to lead her husband &apos;s team against
undefeated trash @-@ talker moe szyslak .
mom did everything : she checked injury lists ,
围观群众
scouting reports , she even studied the tapes .
the tapes of the real housewives of tampa bay ,
where she watched star running back lakwando demarius
get kicked out of his house
after buying his wife the wrong color convertible .
that doesn &apos;t match my phone !
lakwando &apos;s mind won &apos;t be on the game .
and ...
benched .
and now to make my big move .
homer &apos;s team e @-@ mailed asking to start five kickers .
联盟理事长
i was like , &quot; okay , it &apos;s , uh , your funeral . &quot;
there would be no funeral .
high winds , unlocked by the savage power of climate change ,
allowed marge &apos;s five kickers to launch a long @-@ range campaign
of three @-@ point annihilation .
an 85 @-@ yard field goal ?
you got to be kidding me ! refresh , refresh .
but no amount of refreshing could alter the facts :
despite a breathtaking ignorance
and a powerful dislike of the sport ,
a rookie housewife had defeated a savvy veteran ,
proving conclusively that fantasy football
is basically just luck .
ahoy , midshipman .
i hope your voyage on the relation ship
is proving interpersonally fruitful .
i don &apos;t know . it &apos;s really hard
when someone doesn &apos;t respect your authority .
epiphany ho .
and i &apos;m sure your father has been doing some growing
and learning of his own .
* i found some booze in another dad &apos;s bag *
* drunk , drunk . drunk on a boat *
yi @-@ yo @-@ yu !
you don &apos;t need booze , homer .
i went to sea because i &apos;m a recovering alcoholic .
but out here on the waves , i no longer crave
the sweet , warm , soothing flavors of yummy , yummy rummy .
i love this boat !
with all its pullies and flappies and ...
everything has a name .
you know what , homer ?
i &apos;ve always wanted to eat a parrot .
what &apos;s the big deal ? it &apos;s just like a green chicken !
yeah ...
but fortune did not favor the relation ship ,
as the same winds that lofted marge &apos;s fantasy field goals
to victory now sent gales of doom
toward this vessel of questionable therapeutic value .
white lightnin &apos; squall !
why is the captain just juggling ?
okay , o @-@ okay .
i can do this . i can do this .
someone count me in !
i said count me in !
don &apos;t worry , i &apos;ll radio the coast guard for help .
the therapy bears ! look out for the therapy bears !
英勇船长成功救出治疗熊
i &apos;m a @-@ comin &apos; , bears !
声名狼藉的船长被迫卖掉手风琴
don &apos;t stand there gawking like a dang fool !
do somethin &apos; , boy !
you criticized me !
that &apos;s all i ever wanted , daddy ,
honest parenting .
now i &apos;m the ship &apos;s highest @-@ ranking officer .
it &apos;s up to me to get us to shore .
dad , we can make it to harbor
if we can just sail around that lighthouse .
are you crazy ? we &apos;ll never make it !
drop the anchor and wait out the storm !
no , we need to sail .
i &apos;m dropping the anchor !
can &apos;t you just do what i say ?
you &apos;ve never done what i say-- ever !
now can we please respect each other ?
yes , son . we can .
awaiting your orders , mr. midshipman !
put up the storm jib and haul in the main sheet !
aye aye , sir .
another success story for the relation ship .
so , did your sailing adventure help you work out your issues ?
does this answer your question ?
yar ! quite a hornpipe thar be .
but , uh , surely you would never have gone on a sea adventure
without your old friend , the sea captain .
yar .
that &apos;s gonna hurt for a long time .
