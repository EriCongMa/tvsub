i may have to take one of these little guys home .
claire , did you ever find that tupperware i lent you ?
sweetie , for the hundredth time ,
i gave it back to you , remember ?
i remember you telling me a hundred times ,
yet my pea soup is in baggies .
did you check your car ?
in the ...
trunk .
because that &apos;s where you found that thing
that you thought that you gave me long time ago ,
the ... the ...
pizza cutter .
yes , i was wrong that time . i--
it &apos;s a piece of plastic .
you &apos;re ruining brunch .
don &apos;t sweat it , cam .
i forget things all the time .
like i can never remember the name
of that weather guy that i liked . uh ...
thunder something . stormy ...
flash stormy ? ah , whatever the hell it is .
i don &apos;t know .
mm , just eat your eggs , jay .
yeah , just eat your eggs , jay .
grandpa got told !
look at them .
they all think lily &apos;s so great .
the novelty will wear off .
we used to be the cute ones .
now she gets all the attention .
we need to take her down .
and i should remember his name , too ,
because your mom and i got in a big fight over him .
she was using the convertible , and i told her ,
&quot; put the top up because it &apos;s supposed to rain tonight , according to ... &quot;
p @-@ p @-@ p @-@ partly mccloudy ?
whatever the hell his name is . anyway ...
she didn &apos;t . ruined the car .
well , not to be the one that always come to mom &apos;s defense ...
what ? it was 20 years ago .
what , you think he &apos;s gonna ground you ?
it was you ?
yes . yes , i left the top down ,
and i let mom take the fall .
and then they got divorced .
12 years later .
i &apos;m just saying .
ugh . you &apos;re ruining brunch .
relax . it was years ago .
there &apos;s a statute of limitation on this stuff .
in that case , i should probably let you know
i let the top down to let out the cigarette smoke .
not--not mine . not mine .
my--my bad friend eleanor .
eleanor being her boyfriend allen .
statute of limitations .
oh , relax , it &apos;s okay .
remember when i told you
that i couldn &apos;t get to your figure skating semifinal
because i was stuck at work ?
yeah .
well , by &quot; stuck &quot; i meant &quot; drunk , &quot;
and by &quot; work &quot; i meant &quot; the golf course . &quot;
wow . dad ! oh , no .
i got one . i got one .
remember that time we went golfing together ,
and you got a hole @-@ in @-@ one ?
yeah ?
you never got a hole @-@ in @-@ one .
i got bored and i kicked it in the hole .
this is fun . here &apos;s a corker .
they didn &apos;t used to label babies as carefully in hospitals ,
so for two days--
not now , phil .
what do you mean , you-- you kicked the ball in the hole ?
what , was it , like , on the edge ?
yeah , it was on the edge of that , uh ...
what ? that--that sandy thing .
gee , it &apos;s sure gonna be fun to face my friends today .
well , you don &apos;t have to tell them .
they call me &quot; ace , &quot; mitch .
i haven &apos;t paid for a lemonade down there in 20 years .
you &apos;re mad at me ?
great , daddy . you ruined brunch .
you did !
this ends today .
第三季 第十六集
a little help here ?
you can &apos;t expect me to focus
when miranda cornell lives right down your street .
she &apos;s like a dream wrapped in a wish poured into jeggings .
yeah , yeah , that &apos;s nice and all ,
but we got a trap to set .
are you sure this is going to work ?
trust me . we &apos;ll use these cookies as bait .
lily &apos;s crazy for them .
asian metabolism .
when she grabs them with her grubby little hands ,
off goes the trap .
boom--big puddle of milk .
she &apos;ll get in so much trouble .
my mom hates messes .
i &apos;m familiar with claire .
lock ...
and loaded .
these cookies are so good ...
and so easy to reach .
lily !
oh , my god ! cam ! oh ! ohh !
what happened ? are you okay ?
oh ! that milk ... fell , and i must have slipped in it !
did i leave that out again ? i &apos;m so sorry !
oh ! my back ! ooh ! my back !
can i give you a swedish massage , accent optional ?
oh ! oh , no , i just need to lie down .
come on . let &apos;s just get you over to the sofa .
do you think it would be offensive
if i asked our daughter to walk on my back ?
i &apos;d say so . i just offered to give you a massage .
oh , no ! you broke beatrice .
now she can &apos;t feed the dolphins .
what is she talking about ?
oh , it &apos;s a &quot; my sweet companion &quot; doll .
they all have these elaborate backstories .
beatrice works with blind dolphins and models .
there are blind models ?
that &apos;s so sad . they cannot see how pretty they are .
okay . hold on . here we go .
give me some . give me some . give me some . oh !
let me buy lily a new doll .
it &apos;s my fault cam fell .
no , no need . uh , the &quot; my sweet companion &quot; store
actually has a hospital with an on @-@ call doctor .
well , i can go . i &apos;m taking the girls to the mall anyway .
oh , that &apos;d be great . yeah .
and don &apos;t worry . she has medical insurance .
yeah , and i think we &apos;ve met our deductible for the year ,
so you should be good .
yeah .
do you know what a doll is in my village ?
an apple on a fork .
i never really got dolls . does that make me weird ?
it &apos;s on the list .
you &apos;re not weird .
you just kind of skipped the little girl stage .
and jumped to the &quot; i dare you to ring her doorbell &quot; stage .
the only stage you &apos;re ever going to jump on has a pole on it .
hey , at least i have the body--
okay ! okay !
we &apos;re gonna have to settle this dispute in court--
the food court .
the honorable judge cinnabon presiding .
the food court ?
that place smells like the inside of luke &apos;s bicycle helmet .
i like the food court .
me , too .
don &apos;t worry , girls . we &apos;re not gonna deprive ourselves
just &apos; cause of haley &apos;s aversion to food--
oh . oh , haley &apos;s &quot; aversion . &quot;
i thought you said ...
never mind .
okay , so after you have turned on the monitor
and selected your input ,
you can change the channel with this guy .
but if you need to change the volume--
you know what ? i think i &apos;m fine .
why don &apos;t you just go ahead ?
i know this sounds really confusing ,
but there &apos;s actually a very simple way to remember it .
input 1 is the cable box
cable box , ca--
i think i &apos;m just gonna take a nap .
okay . i &apos;m going to yoga .
ay ! that sounds like so much fun .
oh , you should go with her , gloria !
oh , we should definitely do that sometime .
i would love it . bye !
do you see how she gives me the cold shoulders ?
i don &apos;t even know why i try .
ay . sorry .
oh , well , that &apos;s just claire , you know ?
she &apos;s a pritchett .
you gotta break through those walls .
the sooner the better .
you really think so ?
yeah . why don &apos;t you go ? now .
forge that friendship !
okay , i go . i have my gym bag in the car .
feel better !
okay , thank you ! i &apos;m just gonna lie here ...
some ice on my back !
i knew for a fact claire never returned my tupperware .
i just needed a few minutes alone to find it .
and when i did ,
i &apos;d never have to hear them snicker again ,
&quot; oh , silly cam &quot; or &quot; forgetful cam , &quot;
because revenge is a dish best served cold .
and even better , two days later
out of 24 @-@ ounce microwave @-@ friendly
burp @-@ sealed pak @-@ n @-@ stor .
oh , hey ! i thought you were going to the pharmacy .
i forgot my phone .
i think i &apos;m just upset about this stupid thing with my dad .
well , sweetie , i &apos;d love to hear about it
when you come back with my heating pad from the pharmacy ,
because i hurt my back , remember ?
i mean , did he overreact or what ?
it &apos;s just a game , right ?
well , unless there &apos;s something more to it .
maybe you should go talk to him .
yeah .
oh , i should have just kept my mouth shut .
i mean , it was such a great day .
after he thought he got that hole @-@ in @-@ one ,
he took us out to dinner .
he bought me my first beer .
well , there you go . he &apos;s probably hurt
because you marred a very special father @-@ son experience .
you think ?
you marred it .
but you can fix it .
he &apos;s down at the club right now .
go , mitchell !
un @-@ mar that memory !
you know what ? i &apos;m gonna do it .
ow .
sorry .
don &apos;t worry . i &apos;ll be back soon .
okay ! i &apos;ll miss you !
call first .
what were you thinking saying that in front of him ?
i &apos;m sorry . it slipped out .
besides , i figured he knew .
mom knows .
only because she dragged it out of dylan .
and she promised not to tell dad until i left for college ,
which means he might have never found out .
stop panicking .
we don &apos;t even know for sure he heard what i said .
okay . beatrice is with the nurse .
they &apos;ll call us . shouldn &apos;t be too long .
we can just wait until she &apos;s married .
until she &apos;s ... ready .
which , apparently , everyone is these days .
funny , i used to think it &apos;d be years until everyone was ready ,
but i guess i was wrong . wrong and naive .
surprise !
oh ! gloria . my god .
i came to do yoga with you .
i wasn &apos;t expecting to see you here .
yeah , that &apos;s why i say &quot; surprise ! &quot;
oh , yeah . this is awful , because i was just thinking
i might have to bail on yoga .
i have the worst headache all of a sudden .
oh , but yoga is good for that , claire .
for the meditation , for the mmm ...
yeah , yeah . it &apos;s just right now
i wanna go lie down in a dark room and breathe .
that sounds like yoga .
i ... i realize that .
yes .
but still , i @-@ i ... should go .
come on .
i &apos;m not gonna do the class by myself .
okay , so let &apos;s go and get massages .
or there &apos;s a nail salon there .
ooh , i would love to do that some other time ,
i really would . but right now
i need to get home and lie down . you understand , right ?
of course .
okay .
you go !
and lie .
you &apos;re better !
barely . barely , yeah .
i was just getting something cold for my back .
gravy ?
well , if it can save your mom &apos;s turkey ,
it can save anything .
i thought you were going to see your friend miranda .
this one chickened out .
for someone who says he likes girls so much ,
he sure is afraid of them .
it &apos;s a dance , luke .
chicken dance .
well , since you &apos;re back ,
what if i give you 20 bucks ,
and you guys ...
go wash my car ?
is that 20 bucks for each of us , or both of us ?
both .
that &apos;s what i thought .
uh @-@ oh , check it out .
ace is drooling over his plaque again .
oh , i &apos;m sorry . i didn &apos;t smell you idiots come in .
listen , i &apos;ve been thinking ,
maybe it &apos;s time we retire the name &quot; ace . &quot;
you mean the name you had printed on your golf cap ?
and his robe .
you know , guys , about that--
remember how mad he got when i yanked that cap off his head
and put it on ?
you got to earn that !
yeah , yeah , well , i &apos;m just glad
one of those cheap hair plugs didn &apos;t get caught in it .
hey , for the millionth time , they &apos;re not plugs .
so what , your hair just came back when you turned 50 ?
unlike your wife .
hey , that was a blessing .
otherwise , i wouldn &apos;t be taking out natalie hobbes tonight .
taking her out or doing her taxes ?
so i &apos;m trying to find a way to come clean
about the hole @-@ in @-@ one , when it occurs to me ...
why ?
one idiot lies about his sex life ,
the other dumbbell has a ferrari &quot; in the shop &quot; for years ,
and moron number three is a hollywood stunt car driver
who gets sick when he rides backwards in the golf cart .
so you ladies ready to tee off or what ?
yeah , just gotta settle up our tab .
i took care of it .
you said you were going to the restroom .
ah ! can &apos;t trust a word out of this guy &apos;s mouth .
20 years we &apos;ve been falling for this .
i @-@ i &apos;m sorry to interrupt ,
but my dad never lied to you guys .
mitchell ...
no , he didn &apos;t even know until today
that he never made the hole @-@ in @-@ one .
okay .
but the fact that he couldn &apos;t live with himself
when he found out ,
and he raced down here to confess to you ,
that just shows the kind of man he is .
he is a hole @-@ in @-@ one kind of man .
you never got a hole @-@ in @-@ one ?
i didn &apos;t tell them .
so this is the gang .
introduce me .
ahh . score !
it &apos;s not like me and miranda are perfectly suited .
for one thing , she likes bad boys .
that &apos;s just not me .
i &apos;m gonna turn on some music .
i &apos;m sorry .
i can &apos;t unlearn how to treat a lady .
but where does that leave me ?
waiting till i &apos;m 40 when she looks me up on facebook
after a failed first marriage ?
okay .
what are you doing ?
i &apos;m sick of hearing you whine about miranda !
it &apos;s time to make her notice you !
but we can &apos;t !
we got a full tank of gas , and she &apos;s right down the block .
now buckle up !
are you crazy ?
you tell me .
lily , what is this ?
wouldn &apos;t you rather have a chemistry set ,
or some flash cards ?
she &apos;s pretty .
no , she &apos;s dirty .
look . get the dirt .
so let me wipe her off .
fix that .
your braid &apos;s coming loose . come here .
fix that right up .
so i completed the examination .
she did really well .
what &apos;s the prognosis ?
we can fix most of her arm ,
but she &apos;ll never regain full mobility in her shoulder joint ,
because they don &apos;t make that part anymore .
well , that &apos;s pretty good , right ?
i mean , she &apos;ll look exactly the same .
no one will know .
i &apos;ll know .
i &apos;m just saying i liked her the way she was .
she was such a sweet little doll .
i &apos;m sorry , doctor .
i &apos;m having trouble adjusting to all this .
uh , dad , she &apos;s still a sweet little doll .
no , she &apos;s broken .
no , she &apos;s just changed a little .
it happens . dolls grow up .
well , actually--
uh , could you ...
yeah . sure .
i actually have to go
give a little girl some pretty bad news .
so , haley ...
the thing is ...
fact--haley &apos;s almost 18 .
fact--i am the cool dad .
haley , i understand that sex is a part of life .
i can &apos;t say that i &apos;m thrilled to hear this ,
but i &apos;m sure you &apos;re being safe , and i hope that you &apos;ll feel free
to talk to me about this anytime .
we should ...
we should probably get beatrice , like ,
a @-@ a cast or something ,
and we can all sign it . yeah ?
uh , yeah . sure .
fact--i blew it .
this repair &apos;s probably gonna take a little while .
why don &apos;t you run up to the food court and grab us a table ?
i &apos;ll get alex and lily .
okay .
do you want the counter or a booth ?
whatever seems right to you .
i trust you .
i have a cool dad .
okay . your turn .
unh @-@ unh ! no way !
do you wanna get her attention , or not ?
that was amazing !
did you see the look on miranda &apos;s face ?
no . but you did good , thelma .
please stop calling me that . i hate that movie .
what movie ?
uh @-@ oh ! dead end !
you gotta make a u @-@ ey .
i don &apos;t know how to do that .
she pretended to have a headache , cam .
she doesn &apos;t want to spend time with me .
maybe she just wanted to be alone .
why ?
because some people
really value their privacy ,
and you have to respect that .
i have to go .
hola , claire !
gloria , you &apos;ve gotta stop doing that !
were you going back to the yoga class without me ?
no , that is not why i came back .
i don &apos;t understand you .
why you don &apos;t want to spend time with me ?
everybody wants to spend time with me !
even the lady that did my nails
wants to take me to pilates .
i didn &apos;t come back here to do yoga .
i don &apos;t do yoga . it &apos;s a cover , okay ?
look ...
i know that from the outside ,
it seems like i have everything together .
no , not really .
my point is that my life can be very stressful .
and i have found a way to cope with that stress .
and it &apos;s my little secret . and i &apos;m not proud of it .
hey , claire . see you inside .
is that what you do ?
no . no !
okay . you &apos;re coming with me . come in .
but listen to me . gloria ...
it has to stay between us .
this is my sacred space .
it &apos;s just such a great release .
thank you for not judging me .
why would i ?
if anything , it makes me like you more .
so how often do you come here ?
not that often . no .
hey .
maybe a little often .
that &apos;s so sad .
i live with four teenagers .
you live with two adults .
you have no idea ...
no , no , no . it &apos;s so sad
that you come here so often
and that &apos;s the best that you can shoot .
and that &apos;s with pretty nails .
but improper stance . i ...
practice more .
okay .
here you go , ace ...
i mean ... what is your real name ?
jay .
dad , i--
i told you , forget about it .
all right . i @-@ i just want you to know
i get why you &apos;re upset , okay ?
that--that day you got the hole @-@ in @-@ one ,
it meant a lot to you .
and ... i ... i marred it .
but it meant a lot to me , too .
we had a steak dinner , you gave me my first beer ,
and , uh ...
it was one of the greatest days we ever spent together .
and it wasn &apos;t about some meaningless hole @-@ in @-@ one ,
it was about us .
no . it was about a hole @-@ in @-@ one .
yes . yes . a @-@ a little bit , maybe .
but mostly , it was about how we bonded .
i thought i hit a ball straight from the tee
really , really far
into a tiny hole .
okay .
well , when will i learn ?
and it wasn &apos;t your first beer , anyway .
yes , it was , dad , but i wouldn &apos;t expect you to remember .
it was your 14th birthday .
you asked me for a sip of mine .
your mom yelled at you in front of all your friends ,
said you were just a baby .
you ran outside in tears ...
which , unfortunately , supported your mom &apos;s argument .
anyway , i came out with a couple of beers .
we drank &apos; em on the porch
watching the storm clouds coming in .
i had completely forgotten about that .
you know , you &apos;re-- you &apos;re unbelievable .
just when i peg you as some-- - storm stevens ! that &apos;s it !
give me something . i &apos;m gonna write it right here .
before i forget . &quot; storm stevens . &quot;
what were we just talking about ? just now ?
no ?
come on , lily . let &apos;s see if beatrice is ready .
hey , dad ?
i know i &apos;m way too old for this ,
but do you think i could get this doll ?
her name &apos;s genevieve ,
and she &apos;s developing a vaccine for ...
yes , you can get the doll .
you can get as many dolls as you want .
it &apos;s $ 200 .
or one is fine .
i know you &apos;re here .
hello .
i have a bad feeling about this .
what if one of your neighbors saw us ?
maybe we should just confess .
we will ...
in 20 years .
huh ?
you heard grandpa . there &apos;s a statute of limitations ,
which is a good thing
because we still need to take lily down .
nah , let her be the cute one .
we don &apos;t need that anymore .
we &apos;re bad boys now .
yeah . i like that .
bad boys .
your mom !
oh , my god .
cam !
um , this had a lid ?
i &apos;ll see you guys later . i &apos;m going to abby &apos;s .
bye , honey . have fun .
have fun , you ! with abby !
we &apos;ve confirmed abby &apos;s a real person and a female ?
yes , sweetie . we met her .
honey , we can &apos;t treat haley differently
just because we both know what we know about her .
i know . i just need time .
so dylan told you ?
why didn &apos;t he tell me ? he and i used to share everything .
you &apos;re upset about a lot of things .
okay , i won &apos;t obsess over it .
i just wanna ask you one thing .
how long have you known ?
three months .
so this giant thing happened to our first born ,
and you kept me in the dark about it for three whole months ?
i &apos;m sorry . i just wasn &apos;t sure how you &apos;d--okay .
