i had this memory game when i was a kid ,
a bunch of cards facedown in rows .
each card has a picture .
you turn one over , look at it ...
then you turn it back over .
then you have to try and remember
where its matching card was .
i have to get on a plane . i have to get on a plane .
dr. grey , dr. grey , you were on a plane .
you were in a plane crash . can you tell me what you--
derek !
meredith , get up !
sometimes you have no idea .
where--where &apos;s my sister ?
my sister-- where is lexie ?
no , no , no , no .
where--where--where &apos;s my husband and--and--and cristina ?
lay back and relax .
i have to get--
all right .
i have to get to my sister and my husband .
all right . hold on . hold on .
i--my sister .
hey , you can &apos;t go in there .
don &apos;t tell me where i can go .
... there &apos;s an infection and i need to see him .
and other times , it shows us exactly what we need to see .
doctor , we &apos;ve got them . we &apos;re taking care of them .
that &apos;s your mama .
hey , honey .
you sit here . mama &apos;s here , baby .
mama &apos;s here .
the cards seem completely out of order and random ,
but you keep turning them over .
and the more cards you see ...
you get a sense of how everything fits together .
they &apos;re taking us home tomorrow on a plane .
and i said no planes , but we don &apos;t have a choice ,
because of mark and arizona , so ...
so i told bailey to just sedate us--
sedate all of us .
and we &apos;ll never know it happened .
right ?
cristina ?
cristina ?
i wish they had put me out , too .
yeah , i know what you mean .
all i keep thinking is ,
we &apos;re gonna crash on some tropical island
and get attacked by a polar bear .
now ... i don &apos;t know what you mean .
you should watch more tv .
i don &apos;t even know how you can think of leaving .
because it &apos;s harvard .
meredith , because you don &apos;t turn down an offer from harvard .
you have two ,
maybe three surgeries left on your hand before--
you know what ? maybe they have doctors there .
maybe one can help me .
with mark in the condition he &apos;s in , and cristina ?
i &apos;m not saying we leave tomorrow .
they &apos;re just looking for a time frame .
well , i &apos;m sorry , derek .
i know you really want to go . but i can &apos;t even think about it .
this is not about me . this is about you .
you &apos;re at the beginning of your career .
it &apos;s you they want .
i don &apos;t know . i &apos;m not the same man that they hired .
don &apos;t say that .
80 % , meredith .
don &apos;t say that !
we stay here , we work here ,
we move into that beautiful house that you built us .
that was our plan .
that was before you got a job in boston .
and that was before our plane crashed .
mm . blowing off harvard . wow .
you &apos;re blowing off hopkins . wow .
no , i &apos;m postponing hopkins till robbins is better .
avery did the same thing for sloan .
and i stayed .
and you stayed because you have no place else to go .
oh . wake me up in ten for chunky stu .
you just ate .
stuart . short @-@ bowel syndrome kid .
i &apos;m doing an intestinal transplant .
he puked on me the first time we met ,
so i call him &quot; chunky stu . &quot;
arizona hated it ,
but stuart thinks it &apos;s hilarious .
how is arizona &apos;s infection ? is it getting any better ?
don &apos;t know . i haven &apos;t seen her .
what do you mean ? you &apos;re running her service .
you really think she wants to talk to me ?
i mean , what am i supposed to say to her--
&quot; hey , remember the time that i quit
&quot; and you got pissed &quot; and took my seat on a plane that crashed ,
&quot; and now you &apos;re trading in your wheelie sneaks for a peg leg ?
sorry . my bad &quot; ?
how are we doing here ?
hey , jackson , you &apos;re talking to sloan , right ?
keeping him updated .
yeah . not about work stuff , though .
he doesn &apos;t need that kind of pressure right now .
what is wrong with you two ?
i just said that--
no , i &apos;m just saying , they &apos;re fine . they &apos;re gonna be fine .
arizona &apos;s not gonna lose her leg ,
and sloan is coming back .
they &apos;re coming back .
so let &apos;s act like it .
they &apos;re gonna be fine .
we &apos;re all going to be fine .
how long are we saying that this is okay ?
as long as she needs .
i , for one , find it refreshing .
they say , if you don &apos;t have something nice to say ...
she never has anything nice to say .
come on , yang . i &apos;m wide open . just hit me .
i said no more damn restraints !
look , she is clearly a danger .
she doesn &apos;t even belong on this floor .
she is violent , uncommunicative , and i &apos;m worried--
oh , she communicated . she just hasn &apos;t talked yet .
look , there is nothing physically wrong with her .
she belongs up in psych .
i am the chief of surgery and her husband .
don &apos;t tell me where she belongs .
well , with all due respect , sir ,
that is exactly why you shouldn &apos;t be making this decision .
okay .
okay . it &apos;s time .
it &apos;s time to get up .
they are gonna take you upstairs
and they &apos;re gonna pump you full of antipsychotics .
and you &apos;re gonna go slack @-@ jawed and cuckoo &apos;s nest .
and you &apos;ll never be you again .
cristina , please , i am begging you . please .
you have to say something .
cristina , please .
do you hear me ?
say something , please .
不忘往昔
derek , you are gonna be just fine .
how salvageable is that hand , you think ...
i &apos;m a surgeon .
what was that ? did you get that ?
no .
it &apos;s all right .
we &apos;re gonna take good care of you .
there was damage to the second metacarpal ,
but the first m.c.p. joint was completely crushed ,
so at boise did an x @-@ fix .
i revised it to an internal fixator .
and then i removed a lot of scar tissue
so there wouldn &apos;t be contractures .
smart .
oh , thank you . thanks .
did you see how i , uh--
no , no , your work is--is great .
um , derek , it &apos;s the , um , nerve damage
that i &apos;ll concern myself with .
and it looks like a pretty easy fix .
you know , that &apos;ll get you your prehensile strength back .
that &apos;ll get you this back .
which will get me back into the o.r.
that &apos;s ... the hope .
well , that &apos;s the point , isn &apos;t it ?
of course .
but your hand was badly damaged .
and i think conservatively ,
i can get you back to 80 % function .
meredith , i can teach ,
consult .
i just may never do another surgery .
oh , don &apos;t talk like that .
meredith ...
i &apos;m alive .
we survived .
zola has both her parents .
i know .
that &apos;s enough .
meningioma . patient is female , 44 years old .
it &apos;s a tricky spot .
it &apos;s right up against the sagittal sinus .
which is why i suggested dr. ramsey see what you might do .
no radiosurgery . i &apos;d cut it out .
right , but with two draining veins in the way ,
it might be safer to see how she responds--
this woman &apos;s gonna live for another 40 years .
the tumor can recur too easily .
you need to dissect the two draining veins clear
and approach it from this direction .
you get it all , she &apos;s cured .
well , that &apos;s much sexier , isn &apos;t it ?
that &apos;s why we keep him around .
thanks , shepherd . i &apos;d be happy to have you join me ...
or if you &apos;d like to observe .
i , um ... probably have a class to teach .
good luck .
she &apos;s right .
you &apos;re invaluable .
great .
oh , hey , dr. shepherd . this is pretty cool .
dr. ramsey &apos;s got a meningioma invading the sagittal sinus .
she was gonna do it radiosurgically
but decided to go after the whole thing .
oh , is that so ?
yeah . she just freed the first draining vein .
yeah , i got it , ross . thanks .
there &apos;s bleeding on the sinus .
suction .
cottonoids .
okay , let &apos;s put the head of the table up .
no , no , no , no . get the head down .
b.p. is 90 over 50 .
co ₂ is down to 22 .
all right , get the head down . move it down .
she &apos;s sucking in air . you have an air embolus .
boki , bulb irrigate the field .
make sure no more air gets in there . seal it off .
thank you , dr. shepherd . that was , uh--
all right , you have a hole in the sinus you need to take care of .
yes , yes .
you have to carefully reapproximate the edges of the patch graft .
i &apos;ll just seal it with a clip .
no , don &apos;t . that could occlude the sinus .
there . see ? bleeding stopped .
oh , b.p. &apos; s 210 over 130 .
venous infarction . ventriculostomy tube now .
she &apos;s coding .
it &apos;s not your fault .
you didn &apos;t force her to try your approach .
if she couldn &apos;t pull it off , well , then--
i could &apos;ve pulled it off had i been in there .
well , you &apos;ll be back in there .
no , i won &apos;t .
i will be the former neurosurgeon
derek shepherd , research librarian .
shut up .
mark , the guy gave me 80 % .
well , get back to 100 % .
it &apos;s not gonna happen .
don &apos;t give me that crap . you love a hopeless case .
it &apos;s true . it &apos;s the only reason we &apos;re still friends .
i &apos;m glad you &apos;re doing better .
me too .
you will be , too .
100 % , you &apos;ll see .
yeah , coming along .
x @-@ ray shows excellent alignment .
i hear schachter moved your surgery up .
yeah , couple days .
well , fingers crossed . oh .
ohh , sorry .
that was ...
no , it &apos;s okay . it &apos;s fine . i get it .
so i had a look at , uh , schachter &apos;s plan .
he &apos;s opted for an end @-@ to @-@ end repair .
what &apos;d you think ?
it &apos;s good .
oh , it &apos;s great . he &apos;s amazing .
he &apos;s the best , right ?
but ?
but nothing .
it &apos;s just that i &apos;ve-- i &apos;ve been in there .
i &apos;ve seen the amount of gap in the nerve ,
and i know it &apos;s messier ,
but i thought a nerve graft might be better .
that &apos;s all .
i &apos;m sure he &apos;s--he &apos;s thought of it already .
uh , he &apos;s the best .
well , that would be--
be much riskier . you &apos;re right , it is .
but it could mean a full recovery .
you could use your own a.i.n. for the graft .
i &apos;ve used it before .
it &apos;s practically gift @-@ wrapped for a median nerve graft .
yeah , but if the graft doesn &apos;t take ,
we shorten the nerve more .
i could lose more function than i have now .
you &apos;re right . it &apos;s stupid .
that &apos;s why schachter &apos;s not doing it .
he &apos;s smart not to ...
which is why you should .
what ?
i want you to do the surgery .
no .
no .
okay , graft , please .
perfect .
this looks ...
perfect .
it &apos;s arizona . there &apos;s a problem .
watch that line . hold her . get some restraints .
yeah , yeah , yeah . somebody--ow ! damn it !
all right , i got it . i &apos;ve got it .
2 of lorazepam now ! now ! there &apos;s the restraints .
calm down . easy .
calm down . okay . okay .
the combination of extreme exhaustion , dehydration , and exposure
seems to have put her in a state .
what do you mean ?
we think it &apos;s reactive psychosis .
she &apos;s unresponsive ,
and then when we go to examine her ,
she becomes ... violent .
i &apos;m here , okay ?
i wouldn &apos;t do that .
it &apos;s all right .
all right . all right . all right .
cristina . i &apos;m gonna help you .
cristina , i am gonna help you . i &apos;m gonna help you .
i &apos;m here . cristina , i &apos;m here . i &apos;m here .
cristina , i &apos;m here now .
it &apos;s okay . i &apos;m gonna help you .
so she doesn &apos;t speak at all ?
she hasn &apos;t yet .
she just stares ...
and breathes .
it &apos;s kind of weird ,
but the way that they talk about her around here ,
it &apos;s like she &apos;s a legend , you know ?
mm . and now she &apos;s like an end table .
shane , that &apos;s horrible . stop it .
sorry .
i &apos;m gonna take a leave of absence .
i think three years ago , i said i was gonna figure out
how to make a great roast chicken .
still haven &apos;t done it .
i just like how a house smells when there &apos;s a chicken in the oven .
you &apos;re gonna feel stronger in a couple of days
or weeks .
it takes as long as it takes .
and we have all the time in the world .
when you &apos;re back on your feet , you &apos;ll go back to work
at whatever pace you want .
you &apos;ll go back into the o.r. , and you can do your magic .
you won &apos;t have to deal with patients or families .
i &apos;ll take care of all of that .
you ready to get out now ?
i can &apos;t .
what ?
i can &apos;t get out .
are you ...
you can . i &apos;ll ... i &apos;ll help you .
i stayed awake for four days .
i remember ...
every single minute of those four days .
the fire went out .
it was really , really dark .
there were so many stars .
i remember getting the bugs out of arizona &apos;s leg .
i put leaves on it , trying to keep them out .
and mark ...
mark just kept dying .
it was so annoying .
i kept trying to help him ,
but he just kept trying to die on me .
i just wanted to lie down ...
and sleep on him because he was warm .
and i wanted to sleep .
meredith was asleep .
everyone was asleep .
arizona got the last of the water ,
and i remember drinking something bad .
it might have been the fuel from the plane ?
i drank ...
my pee .
the noises ...
the animal noises ...
fighting and growling right ...
next to us , right there .
i kept waiting for them to come and kill me ,
but they didn &apos;t .
and then i realized ...
they were fighting over lexie .
i tried to keep them off of her .
i tried .
but i couldn &apos;t get out .
i can &apos;t get out .
you &apos;re out now .
i &apos;ve got you .
you hear me ?
i can &apos;t get out .
don &apos;t you see ?
i &apos;ll never get out .
you okay ?
yep .
you sure you know what you &apos;re doing ?
yes . it &apos;s one highway all the way to minnesota ...
through montana , cross one of the dakotas ,
i can &apos;t remember which .
no , i meant by leaving .
are you sure you &apos;re okay with it ?
are you sure it &apos;s the right thing to do ?
meredith , not you , too .
owen just tried to ...
well , yeah , because i &apos;m worried that you &apos;re just running away .
well , yeah , i am . i &apos;m fleeing ,
like bambi from a forest fire ,
and so should you , &apos; cause horrible things happen here .
no , something horrible happened ,
and we should stick together .
you know what ? we have stuck together .
and we &apos;ve grown together , like two gnarled trees
twining around each other , trying to survive .
survive what ? cristina , this is life .
bad things happen . it &apos;s hard .
you find your people ,
you find your person , and you lean on them .
oh , god love you , mer .
you know , so many horrible things have happened to you ,
and maybe you &apos;re okay with it ,
but you shouldn &apos;t be .
go to harvard ,
anywhere except here ,
seeing your dead sister around every corner .
hey , your mother died here . your husband was shot here .
george died here .
it &apos;s my life , and you were here for it , too .
i mean , now you sound like the same scary loner bitch
who rode in here on a motorcycle five years ago .
like the past five years has never happened ?
well , you know , a part of me wishes it hadn &apos;t .
oh , okay . well , then you should just go then .
and you should not look back . go .
meredith ...
no , you know , cristina , you &apos;re right . i &apos;m not your person .
and owen isn &apos;t your person .
your person is you , and it always has been .
what the hell did they do to this guy out there ?
hold my hand .
he &apos;s bradying down .
yeah , i got a pulse .
clear .
i flew to boise .
i @-@ i was there , but they wouldn &apos;t let me in .
they said i wasn &apos;t family .
it &apos;s not fair .
you don &apos;t deserve ...
you deserve better .
shh . stop it .
i &apos;m here .
i &apos;m not going anywhere , mark .
i love you .
i love lexie .
loved .
i &apos;m sorry .
callie .
callie .
go home .
no , i &apos;m all right .
no , you &apos;re not .
you &apos;ve been up for the past two nights
bouncing between arizona &apos;s room and here .
i just need some coffee . can you , um ...
can you stay with him while i run to the cafeteria ?
i &apos;ll stay with him all night .
i just feel like we &apos;re losing him , derek .
usually when i talk to him , i sense that he &apos;s there ,
that he &apos;s listening , but i think he &apos;s giving up .
i &apos;m so scared ,
the second i leave this hospital ,
i &apos;m gonna get a phone call that he &apos;s dead .
that &apos;s not gonna happen tonight .
promise ?
if he starts going south , i &apos;ll tell him to cut it out .
he idolizes me . mm .
he &apos;ll do whatever i say .
thank you .
you heard what i told her .
don &apos;t make me look like an ass .
pull it together .
a lot of people counting on you .
damn it . i knew i shouldn &apos;t have gone home .
is he okay ? did he code ?
just come see .
oh , god . where the hell is shepherd ?
avery , tell me what &apos;s going on .
torres .
where you been ?
pretty amazing recovery , right ?
yeah , his sats are good
he &apos;s being weaned off pressors .
yeah , b.p. is 110 over 60 .
and he &apos;s making inappropriate sexual comments to brooks .
it &apos;s fine .
no , it &apos;s--it &apos;s not .
but , uh , right now i &apos;m really , really enjoying it , so ...
you think it &apos;s the surge .
mm . it--it might be .
i don &apos;t . i don &apos;t think it is .
what &apos;s the surge ?
in many terminally ill patients ,
they have a final surge of energy .
they get better before they get worse .
but this is not that .
but in a little while , he &apos;ll do what all patients do .
he &apos;ll have epiphanies ,
he &apos;ll tell you what really matters in life ,
ask for his family .
the man is telling dirty jokes . it &apos;s not a--not a surge .
no , i don &apos;t think so either .
uh , i have a facial lac .
uh , oh , i had a consult this morning--
breast augmentation , &quot; b &quot; to &quot; d. &quot;
did you tell her her breasts were beautiful the way they are ?
no , i still think that &apos;s weird .
well , i know you do , but you &apos;re wrong .
you tell her she &apos;s beautiful just the way she is ,
and if she believes you ,
you &apos;ve saved someone
an unnecessary surgical procedure .
and that is definitely not how i talk to patient .
no , but it &apos;s how you talk to a woman , avery .
we &apos;re in the business
of making people feel better about themselves .
again , sometimes when you talk ,
i feel like a male prostitute .
she &apos;s a person on the precipice of change , avery .
she &apos;s scared and she &apos;s worried .
god , the things we worry about .
so pointless .
and we get to help take that worry away .
it &apos;s why we &apos;re doctors .
it &apos;s actually why we &apos;re people ,
but somehow we forget that all that matters is people .
and whether we walk away leaving them better
or worse for having met us .
we control that , avery .
i want you to promise me something .
if you love someone ,
you tell &apos; em .
eeven if you &apos;re scared that it &apos;s not the right thing .
eeven if you &apos;re scared that it &apos;ll cause problems .
even if you &apos;re scared
that it will burn your life to the ground ,
you say it , and you say it loud .
and then you go from there .
hey , where &apos;s my kid ? i want to see sofia .
avery , why don &apos;t you run up to day care
and bring her down here ?
i can &apos;t bring a baby in the i.c.u.
no , but you can sneak one in .
come on , avery . grow a pair .
you know what ? forget it . i &apos;ll do it .
whoa , no , no , no . all right . i &apos;ll get her .
i &apos;ll get her .
yes !
my man !
is this what i think it is ?
there &apos;s no way to know .
we &apos;ll just ... take it as it comes .
okay ?
um , can we talk ? i &apos;m leaving .
no . actually , i &apos;ve gotta grab sofia for sloan .
he needs to see her .
but i can , uh , call you later .
uh , no , jackson . i &apos;m--i &apos;m leaving ...
for home--moline .
my flight &apos;s in a few hours .
what do you ...
i ... i don &apos;t have a job here anymore .
my contract actually ended a few days ago ,
but i stuck around , waiting for sloan to get better ,
and he &apos;s better , so ...
all right , i &apos;ve gotta get sofia right now , okay ?
but can you just wait ?
just wait for me at joe &apos;s .
we can have a drink , we can talk .
just ... okay ? just wait for me at joe &apos;s .
don &apos;t tell callie .
she &apos;s about to operate on derek .
okay .
derek doesn &apos;t need to go in this surgery worried ,
so don &apos;t say anything to him .
they can reschedule the surgery , mark .
i &apos;m sure they &apos;d want to .
no .
that surgery &apos;s gonna get derek back into the o.r.
where he belongs .
nobody &apos;s got better hands than him ,
except maybe callie .
have you looked at her hands ? they &apos;re beautiful .
sofia has her hands .
callie ...
really doesn &apos;t even know how good she is .
sometimes you wish people ...
would just see themselves the way you do .
listen to me ,
this the surge talking ?
no , this is you .
this is all you .
so keep going ...
&apos;cause i &apos;m not going anywhere .
the extensive bone injury
along with the degree of soft @-@ tissue infection
is ... troubling .
no matter what we do , it &apos;s--
if the infection goes to the bone ,
it &apos;ll be hard to treat .
and eventually , you &apos;re looking at bone loss .
i &apos;m gonna have to say ...
officially , i &apos;m recommending amputation .
show me those .
show them to me .
i withhold consent .
i withhold consent .
before you drug me or sedate me ,
i give n @-@ nobody permission to cut off my leg .
and certainly not some yahoo in dump truck , idaho .
i want to go home to callie .
she &apos;ll know what to do .
just take me home .
how &apos;s that ? mm . yeah .
does that feel all right ? does that hurt ?
it doesn &apos;t hurt .
and anything that doesn &apos;t hurt feels good .
thanks .
is the infection better or worse ?
don &apos;t worry about that right now , okay ?
just ... try to feel good .
uh , sorry i haven &apos;t been around .
i , uh , just wanted to let you know
that i gave , uh , chunky stu--
uh , sorry , stuart , his intestinal transplant today .
it went great . he &apos;s-- he &apos;s responding well . oh .
uh , and i know that you like to do that thing
where you bring him his favorite food
in a couple of months when he can handle solids ,
so it &apos;s , uh , it &apos;s hawaiian pizza ,
i just thought i should tell you .
thank you .
i feel like crap .
it should &apos;ve been me on that plane .
if i could trade places with you , i would--
i would let you .
i had that thought a lot , too .
and i didn &apos;t like myself for it ,
but i did .
i kept thinking about my wife and baby ,
and how you had no wife and no baby ,
you had no one .
i only went on that plane because i was pissed at you .
so i kept wondering ...
i &apos;m only here because he &apos;s so selfish and thoughtless .
and no matter how hard i tried to make him better ,
he &apos;s still a horrible person .
so now ...
i keep wondering ...
why this would happen to someone like me ,
instead of someone like you ?
so i guess i &apos;m still pretty pissed off .
would you get out of my room ,
please ?
hey . look who &apos;s here .
hey . we just had lunch ,
and now it &apos;s back to the crayon mines for her .
bye , baby . i &apos;ll see you tonight .
you need to take her to the park more .
she goes from that apartment to the day care .
she &apos;s indoors all day .
okay .
yeah . we should ... we should get a house .
slow down .
then she could have a yard and she doesn &apos;t ...
have to be inside ...
all the time .
hey . what &apos;s wrong ?
do we have a plan yet ?
do we ?
we are waiting for the infection to improve ,
and then we will know what options we have .
well , if the vancomycin isn &apos;t working ,
then put me on colistin . it &apos;ll be stronger .
i understand that it &apos;s hard to just ...
no , you don &apos;t .
you don &apos;t , because you know what your life is going to be .
you know if you &apos;re going to ... take her to the park
or if you &apos;re gonna stand at an o.r. table again .
you will .
of course you will .
i know . i know what my options are !
and the longer we wait ,
the more that my vascularity diminishes ,
the more the nerves die , the more the muscle atrophies ,
and then there &apos;s only one option left !
okay , we are so far from that happening .
do something , callie !
you need to do something .
please . please don &apos;t give up on ... on me .
arizona , i &apos;m not .
promise ... promise me ...
i ...
you won &apos;t let them take my leg .
i promise .
i do . i promise , okay ? i promise you .
it &apos;s okay .
this is a good plan .
you &apos;re not her doctor .
oh , i &apos;m not saying i &apos;ll do the surgery .
carlson can do it .
there is a real possibility she may lose her leg .
you need to help her prepare for that .
no , no ! no .
an intramedullary nailing can save the leg .
define &quot; save &quot; ?
her leg will never be the same .
a prosthetic can give arizona a better quality of life
than years of rehab and chronic pain .
i don &apos;t need to tell you this .
no , in fact , it &apos;s pretty condescending .
or the surgery will make her infection worse
and increase her risk of d.v.t.
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m sorry . it &apos;s her leg .
i &apos;m risking it . i am doing it .
you are not doing anything .
she is your wife , not your patient .
she &apos;s not , though . she &apos;s not my wife !
i ...
i don &apos;t know who she is .
did this happen with cristina ?
it &apos;s like you &apos;re looking at her , but there &apos;s nothing inside ?
i feel like she &apos;s just this shell .
all the arizona &apos;s been scooped out ...
and she &apos;s just this shell now ,
and i want her back .
and i don &apos;t think i &apos;ll ever get her back
if we cut off that leg ,
so i &apos;m going to save it .
i &apos;ve made a plan to save it , and you &apos;re gonna get on board .
and then we &apos;ll work out a plan to get cristina back ,
but you need to help me now .
i don &apos;t think i &apos;m ever gonna get cristina back .
you gonna use a free flap to cover the open fracture site ?
yeah .

initial here .
&quot; in the event that i am close to death
&quot; and life support would only postpone
&quot; that moment of my death ,
&quot; i , &apos; a &apos; --want to receive tube feeding ,
&quot; &apos; b &apos; --i want tube feeding only as my physician recommends ,
&quot; and &apos; c &apos; ...
i do not want tube feeding . &quot;
initial one .
this section specifies a time of withdrawal of care .
&quot; life @-@ sustaining care shall be withdrawn
if signs of recovery are not seen after a period of ... &quot;
30 days .
you &apos;ve reached cristina yang . leave a message .
hey , so i haven &apos;t called because ...
well ...
neither have you , so ...
you were right ...
about all of it .
you were right .
crash cart !
this is a place where horrible things happen .
you were right to go .
you &apos;re probably escaping disaster .
clear !
uh , will you take her , please ?
look at me .
i practically grew up here .
10 @-@ blade .
here you go , doctor .
and you &apos;re right .
it &apos;s hurt me ...
in ways i &apos;ll probably never get over .
i have a lot of memories of people ...
people i &apos;ve lost forever .
but i have a lot of other memories , too .
this is the place where i fell in love ...
the place where i found my family .
this is where i learned to be a doctor ...
where i learned how to take responsibility
for someone else &apos;s life .
and it &apos;s the place i met you .
so i figure this place has given me
as much as it &apos;s taken from me .
i &apos;ve lived here as much as i &apos;ve survived here .
it just depends on how i look at it .
i &apos;m gonna choose to look at it that way
and remember you that way .
hope you &apos;re good .
bye .
hello ?
you are my person .
