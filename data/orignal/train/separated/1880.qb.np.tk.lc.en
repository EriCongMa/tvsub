you liked the tile
and the master bedroom suite ?
and you like the way the french doors open out to the deck ?
yes , i love everything so far .
i especially love that i didn &apos;t have to do anything .
meow .
meow . that &apos;s right , zola .
that &apos;s what a cat says .
honestly , when the house is done ,
just bring me out for the big reveal .
you want a big reveal ?
i want a big reveal .
rawr !
good , zola . rawr . that &apos;s what a lion says .
is that a ...
that &apos;s a lion .
we have a phrase in the operating room ,
&quot; don &apos;t pet the lion . &quot;
it means ,
no matter how nice a tumor looks ,
how small it is ,
how perfect its margins may be ...
cristina ,
it &apos;s been a week .
at some point , we have to talk .
it &apos;s still a tumor .
it &apos;s still dangerous
and it can bite .
it &apos;ll be weird at first .
believe me , you &apos;ll feel like an idiot .
but the words can give you closure and strength .
so i want you each later
to find a private moment and just say the words aloud--
i am a widow .
gretchen ?
it was just so sudden .
jason was fine , and then one day ,
they said he had some blockages ,
minor congestive heart failure ,
and then he died , and i--
i &apos;m--i &apos;m sorry .
but blockages with congestive heart failure ?
i mean , do you want to know what that really means ?
your husband &apos;s arteries were clogged .
i mean , he probably was lucky he lasted as long as he did ,
because his heart was working overtime to pump enough blood
to his brain , let alone the rest of his body ,
which ate away the heart muscle
till the ventricular wall was paper thin
and barely contracting .
because , just to be clear ,
there is no such thing
as minor congestive heart failure .
a patient with symptoms that severe ?
they &apos;re-- they &apos;re-- they &apos;re a dead man walking .
a lion ? an actual lion ?
looking at me like i was lunch .
are you sure it wasn &apos;t a mountain lion
or ... maybe a well @-@ fed cat ?
i was staring at simba .
grey , you &apos;re on my service .
hey .
i @-@ i saw a lion today ,
walking across the street .
derek and i were coming back from the house ,
and it was just standing there in the street .
cristina &apos;s not talking to me .
okay , how come no one is concerned about the fact
that i saw a lion walking around seattle ?
sorry . i was just , uh--
you can &apos;t force cristina to open up .
you have to just let her come to you .
in the meantime , look at this .
animal control came .
one dart , and he was down .
it walked across the road , right in front of us .
i feel like julia and i are at a crossroads .
it &apos;s been five months .
maybe it &apos;s time to take the next step
and ask her to move in .
did you hear what i said ?
it was a lion .
you like julia , right ?
dr. webber .
don &apos;t you have a gallbladder scheduled for this morning ?
hendricks is doing it .
you heard about the lion mauling .
came down here to claim it before anybody else
could get their hands on it .
i am down here for those in need , avery .
i am here to be of service to human kind .
yeah , well , you could be of service to human kind
in o.r. three with that gallbladder .
try it , son .
try and challenge me .
35 @-@ year @-@ old male , body covered in claw marks
and an arm that looks like a chew toy .
oh , my god . oh , my god . my arm .
i can &apos;t feel my arm .
don &apos;t worry . i &apos;m gonna take care of you .
so am i.
naomi . what happened to naomi ?
did the lion eat my girlfriend ?
these wounds are deep . avery ,
page sloan and torres .
or you can page sloan and torres .
well , somebody page sloan and torres right now !
32 @-@ year @-@ old female , nasty bites to the neck ,
and her abdomen &apos;s been eviscerated .
kirby . where &apos;s kirby ?
ma &apos;am , my name is dr. bailey .
you are at the hospital .
transferring on one , two , three .
okay , i need to look at this neck .
what about kirby ?
all right , let &apos;s call for an o.r. and page hunt .
i need to know if kirby &apos;s okay . did he get hurt ?
um , can you also find out the status
of the gentleman who came in with her ?
no , no . that &apos;s paul . i want to know about kirby ,
my lion .
so what , it--it escaped , like from the zoo ?
no , someone &apos;s house . the thing was a pet .
what ?
yeah .
i went to a grief group .
ew . you went to a grief group ?
callie .
you went to a grief group . yay .
no , not &quot; yay . &quot;
bad .
dr. altman ,
i &apos;m ready to get started on your stem cell project .
see ? i mean , who needs a grief group ?
i am doing cutting @-@ edge stem cell research .
i @-@ i &apos;m looking toward the future ,
not dwelling on the past . right ?
sorry to interrupt .
um , it &apos;s my last day , and , um ,
i just wanted to say good @-@ bye .
well , it &apos;s been great working with you .
good luck back east .
good @-@ bye .
bye .
is it okay if i give you a hug ?
why wouldn &apos;t it be okay ?
um , yeah , of course it is . come here , colleen .
give me a hug .
i think he grew . doesn &apos;t he look longer ?
sure . he &apos;s gonna play hoops .
i &apos;m serious . you should measure him .
he shot up an inch overnight .
i @-@ i gotta change his dressing .
you changed his dressing , like , an hour ago .
please measure him .
i &apos;m using my puppy dog eyes .
he needs a new tape measure .
i need off this case .
put kepner on it or something .
this is about the lion , isn &apos;t it ?
you want to go see the victims .
i don &apos;t blame you .
all right . go on . go get a look and then come back .
oh , and take pictures while you &apos;re there .
this isn &apos;t about the lion . this is about morgan .
she &apos;s in @-@ into me .
karev , we work with sick kids
and then we develop close relationship with their parents .
it &apos;s normal . you just need to deal with it .
and you-- you put up boundaries .
i &apos;m trying , but she acts like we &apos;re , you know ...
i @-@ i can &apos;t be this kid &apos;s doctor , okay ?
alex , he smiled .
you gotta come see . he--he &apos;s smiling .
oh , okay .
you want off my service , you can be off my service .
but , alex ,
you better mean it .
i mean it .
okay .
i mean it .
the patient &apos;s belly is ripped open .
spleen and intestines are exposed .
what happened ?
she has a lion for a pet is what happened .
it tried to eat her and then it got away
and it probably tried to eat other people
because it is a lion .
who has a lion living in their house ?
i &apos;ll tell you who has a lion living in their house--
a crazy person does .
now because she &apos;s crazy
doesn &apos;t mean she doesn &apos;t deserve excellent care .
in fact , we &apos;re going to save that crazy lady &apos;s life
just so i can tell her she &apos;s crazy .
got it ?
told you i saw a lion .
i know you know .
is this about cristina again ?
she walks away every time i try to talk to her ,
so just let her know how sorry i am .
i wish i could take it back .
if i could--it-- it was just sex .
just stop .
i would love to stop .
i mean , i don &apos;t relish discussing
my own personal failings with you , but--
we &apos;re going to pretend this conversation never happened .
okay ?
meredith--
no . i mean it .
damn it . now i have to scrub again .
do you know anything about arizona
and that nurse colleen ?
were they a thing before she met me ?
ortho nurse colleen ?
yeah . there was a good @-@ bye hug that lingered too long .
that would explain it .
i been trying to get her naked for three years .
anyway , she never said anything ,
and i @-@ i work with colleen every day .
do you think she has other exes here in the hospital ?
probably .
oh , quit it . stop thinking about the hot ortho nurse .
wait . you ... you think she &apos;s hot ?
i @-@ i could see it in those eyes .
those eyes said , &quot; you are meat . &quot;
and in that moment , i believed him .
what happened then ?
then he lunged , and i just reacted .
i shoved my arm right into his mouth .
who the hell who does that ?
who the hell feeds himself to a lion ?
i &apos;m kinda wondering the same thing .
what do we got ?
deep animal claw laceration extending down
the left side of the body .
and there &apos;s your arm .
yeah , that &apos;s what you expect when you hear &quot; lion . &quot;
i bet it &apos;s nice to know what to expect
instead of showing up at your girlfriend &apos;s house for the first time
and being greeted at the door by the freakin &apos; king of the jungle .
she never bothered to mention she had a pet lion ?
seems like something that ought to come up on a first date .
right ? she told me she had a cat--
a big cat-- and i &apos;m allergic ,
so i took an antihistamine before i left the house .
oh , yeah . you shoulda brought a bull whip .
so i dissect out and remove the animal cadaver hearts .
then i insert them with the catheters
and begin injecting them with the solvent .
correct . and why do we do that ?
to drain the hearts of their existing cardiac cells
so all that &apos;s left is their extracellular matrix .
like stripping a house down to its frame only .
we are scrubbing away cells of hearts , cristina ,
actual hearts .
we are wiping them clean ,
&apos;till they &apos;re blank .
and then in theory ,
when we inject them with stem cells ...
they &apos;ll live again .
let &apos;s grow ourselves some new hearts .
dr. altman , i-- i traded with kepner .
i &apos;m on your service today .
are you up on my patients ?
karev ? karev , can you focus ?
yeah . sorry .
oh , that &apos;s the e.r. let &apos;s go .
happy scrubbing .
you immobilize the aneurysm and place the clip .
wait . i &apos;m clipping the aneurysm ?
what if it ruptures ?
i @-@ i clip proximal and distal to the aneurysm .
what if you damage the perforating vessels ?
i throw a temporary clip on the parent artery .
it &apos;s okay if you don &apos;t want me to do it .
i @-@ i know that i- i really messed up last week .
yes , you did .
but you &apos;re still a student ,
and this is how you learn .
any other questions ?
are you gonna tell mark to move in with julia ?
i mean , what do they even really talk about ?
you know , she sews eyeballs for a living . it &apos;s gross .
i mean , plus , she has really thin hair ,
which can be a @-@ a sign of early menopause .
we don &apos;t talk about stuff like this .
we don &apos;t talk about stuff like this .
i will see you in pre @-@ op .
you &apos;re not using the oil .
alex uses his oil when tommy &apos;s distressed .
it keeps him from desaturating .
his sats are really low . i don &apos;t think the oil is--
just use the oil .
can we page dr. robbins ?
no , page dr. karev . alex--
page robbins now !
can you describe the pain ?
i don &apos;t know . it just , uh ...
it &apos;s like a ...
it--it &apos;s crushing me
and i can &apos;t shake it .
hand me the e.k.g.
it looks like anterolateral m.i ..
we almost didn &apos;t come in .
we &apos;re only in town till tomorrow .
we &apos;re catching a cruise for alaska .
mr. carroll , you &apos;re experiencing a heart attack .
we need to take you up to the cath lab
for an angioplasty .
can you tell me what you were doing
when you felt the chest pain ?
we just went out to walk around our bed and breakfast .
and it was like a piano fell
onto my chest .
so you were walking .
you weren &apos;t running or anything else
that might have triggered the pain ?
well ...
we saw a lion .
so that was a little awkward .
don &apos;t you think , that thing with colleen ?
how she was-- she got so emotional .
almost seems like you guys were a thing .
yeah , she gets like that .
oh , really ?
she gets like that , like you know how she gets ,
like you were a thing ?
callie .
what ? it &apos;s not ... what ? i &apos;m just asking .
it &apos;s not a big deal .
oh , we were . we were a ... a little bit of a thing
a very long time ago .
seems like something you would &apos;ve mentioned .
well , it didn &apos;t even occur to me .
have you dated other people in the hospital
it hasn &apos;t occurred to you to tell me about ?
okay , you know what ? we &apos;re not doing this .
no , it &apos;s totally fine .
i mean , i &apos;ll tell you about my exes .
i know about your exes .
not all of them . you don &apos;t know about karev .
karev . i know about karev .
look , just give me a number . ballpark .
what , five ? ten ? a hundred ?
okay , that &apos;s the nicu . i have to go .
no , no , no , no , no . you can &apos;t just go .
i &apos;m sorry , but the babies , they need me , so ...
arizona--
oh , i &apos;m sorry . wait . wait . wh--
&quot; dr. robbins , please help us . &quot;
just--just give me a number .
just give me a number . just give me a number .
one or two , okay ?
that &apos;s--that &apos;s it .
one or two .
that &apos;s not so bad .
maybe she should &apos;ve gotten a dog .
a dog fetches balls .
maybe , you know , a rascally dog .
he chews shoes .
but he doesn &apos;t eviscerate your spleen .
yeah , and don &apos;t say it &apos;s because you love lions so much .
if you love lions ,
you wouldn &apos;t want it to live in your home .
you would want that lion to roam freely
in the jungle with other lions
where they can eviscerate the spleens of ...
gazelles .
that &apos;s what lions eat , gazelles ?
i think i saw that on a show
where they were chasing a herd of gazelles .
have i offended someone ?
&apos;cause it &apos;s awfully quiet in here .
well , don &apos;t tell me you own
an exotic pet that i don &apos;t know about .
grey , you living with a monkey ?
please don &apos;t tell me you &apos;re living with a monkey .
no . no monkeys .
uh , hunt ?
no . cristina doesn &apos;t believe in pets .
cristina doesn &apos;t believe in a lot of things .
okay , then .
suction .
i &apos;m sorry . explain it again ?
during the angioplasty ,
mr. carroll had another heart attack .
we placed a balloon pump to stabilize him ,
but that only buys us a little time .
they &apos;re gonna have to do surgery , emma .
but he--he &apos;s going to be okay ?
if we can perform a coronary artery bypass soon ,
i &apos;m hopeful that we &apos;ve caught it in time .
i am so sorry , em .
you &apos;ve been waiting for this trip 50 years .
this cruise was a ... gift
from our kids for our anniversary .
and now i &apos;ve messed it all up .
you didn &apos;t mess anything up .
you wanted to see those humpback whales so bad .
forget the whales .
we came face @-@ to @-@ face with a lion .
yes , we did .
it &apos;s already a heck of a vacation .
yes , it is .
happy anniversary , martin .
say that to me tomorrow .
make sure his labs are up to date ,
and then we &apos;ll take him up to pre @-@ op .
what is wrong with you ?
i @-@ i know--i know that we don &apos;t ...
we don &apos;t talk about this stuff .
okay ? but i @-@ i kinda need to talk about this stuff ,
because what if i don &apos;t and then i miss an opportunity
to appeal to my big brother about , you know , what--
what if mark is my soul mate ?
i am not your best friend right now , lexie .
i am not your big brother . i am your attending ,
and what i need is my resident .
you &apos;re right .
i &apos;m sorry . i ...
i am your resident .
good . make sure our patient is prepped .
you have an aneurysm to clip .
we came to see the hearts .
oh , this blows .
yang &apos;s growing organs ,
and i &apos;m stuck patching up grandpa .
is that morgan again ?
why don &apos;t you just answer her already ?
i &apos;ve gotta be a dead frickin &apos; mouse .
cold and dead , okay ?
i mean , that &apos;s what she needs .
all day , i &apos;m trying to back off ,
and all she does is--
see ?
hey , you can do this .
all right ? you are good at being a douche ,
and that &apos;s just , what , one step away from being cold and dead ?
i mean , right , yang ?
see what she &apos;s doing ?
that &apos;s what you need to do .
do that . do what she &apos;s doing .
hey , did you guys hear about a lion lady ?
yeah . her boyfriend was the appetizer ,
and he wanted mommy for dinner .
i feel bad for her .
okay , she &apos;s just a girl with a pet .
you know , she probably had some nice friends once ,
and maybe even a nice guy .
and then those friends moved away .
the guy started living with somebody else ,
and then her family probably abandoned her ...
leaving her alone to rot in an attic somewhere with her cat ,
her big jungle cat ,
who was sitting in the corner ,
just licking his paws ,
just wanting to eat her stupid face off .
look , this is a scientific lab , not a lunchroom ,
so everyone out right now .
cold and dead .
tommy &apos;s contrast study shows
that his sepsis is due to an ileocolic fistula .
so do the surgery .
he has a bleed , and he &apos;s developed
a post @-@ hemorrhagic hydrocephalus .
he has r.o.p.
he &apos;s at risk for cerebral palsy ,
blindness , deafness ,
inability to walk or feed himself ,
cognitive disabilities--
i don &apos;t see how this surgery changes that .
it doesn &apos;t , but it &apos;s invasive .
i mean , there &apos;s a chance it won &apos;t work ,
and he &apos;ll need more surgeries .
yeah , i know that .
i have been here dealing with this for a while .
i @-@ i know more about this stuff than you do .
where--where is alex ?
he &apos;s on another case .
i think that you need to consider your other option .
if we don &apos;t escalate care ...
have they taught you what a.n.d. means yet ?
allowing natural death .
we &apos;re--we &apos;re not-- we &apos;re not there yet .
things are deteriorating significantly .
you--you think that &apos;s what i should do ?
i think that you need to consider
what kind of life you want for your son .
is it okay for him to be in pain every day ?
is it okay if he needs a feeding tube
for the rest of his life ?
is it okay if he can &apos;t run ,
climb , or crawl ?
if you want the surgery , we &apos;ll do it .
but if you decide
that enough is enough ,
then we &apos;ll support that choice , too .
arizona just taught me what a.n.d. is .
i guess my med school education &apos;s not dead yet .
imagine ...
the power it takes to cause injuries like these .
a flick of your wrist , and whoosh .
nope . you know what these injuries are ?
this is natural selection at work .
i mean , the guy was an idiot .
i don &apos;t care how desperate you are for sex ,
if a chick tells you she wants you to meet her cat ,
you run ... fast .
he was blindsided by someone he trusted .
you never know how you &apos;re gonna react when that happens .
what did you say to robbins ?
hmm ? oh , nothing .
i just asked her how many other exes she has in the hospital .
she said one or two . i can live with one or two , right ?
what was that ? why did he cough ?
don &apos;t say anything . we &apos;re not in this .
webber , why &apos;d you cough ?
oh , um , well , it &apos;s--
it &apos;s a little like when a patient tells you
they have one or two drinks a @-@ a week .
we all round that number up
because patients tend to tell us what we want to hear .
if they &apos;ll admit to two drinks ...
they &apos;re having so many more .
oh , i got--i got something sharp here .
a lion tooth .
all right .
hey , hey , hey , don &apos;t just toss that aside just yet .
boki , keep that safe , will you ?
mrs. carroll , i &apos;m on my way up to surgery now .
the grandkids want pictures of the lion ,
but , oh ... these damn phones make it so hard
to see the damn buttons .
may i ?
there . it &apos;s sent .
wow . you -- you guys really did get up close .
martin faced a lion today .
he faced a lion
and he didn &apos;t get eaten .
he &apos;s not ...
it &apos;s not his time , dr. altman .
please don &apos;t make me a widow .
i don &apos;t want you to worry .
i am very good at my job .
okay ?
watch the angle .
you &apos;re gonna clip the perforators .
no , no , stop .
lexie , i &apos;m sorry .
but i think i should do this .
yeah , yeah . it &apos;s -- it &apos;s okay .
um , next time .
i &apos;m not gonna tell mark what to do .
you &apos;re not ?
they &apos;re gonna move in together either way .
the man has always been easy to read .
and the only thing that could change that
is if he knew he still had a shot with you .
really ?
he &apos;s happy with the eyeball doctor .
so make sure you want him back because you want him
not because he &apos;s with somebody else .
all right . the grafting is complete .
let &apos;s wean him off bypass .
dr. karev , it &apos;s yours .
it &apos;s from a morgan .
&quot; did you get my last text ? where are you ? &quot;
and then it says , &quot; we need to talk ! &quot; all caps .
is that the intern with the preemie ?
yep .
&quot; you &apos;re ignoring me . you &apos;re a total ... &quot;
then there &apos;s a lot of strong language .
if you need to step away , just say so .
i &apos;m fine . are we warmed ?
yes , we are , doctor .
for what it &apos;s worth , i think you &apos;re doing the right thing .
she needs to figure out how to take care of herself
and her baby .
she &apos;s alone .
there is no time like the present to embrace it .
turn it off . please .
all right . removing the aortic cross @-@ clamp now .
i see some bleeding .
damn it . the ventricle &apos;s ruptured .
3 @-@ 0 prolene . get in there with the suction , karev .
oh , come on , martin . come on . damn it .
meredith --
hey , just don &apos;t talk to me . okay ?
she knew i would hate you ,
but she didn &apos;t want me to hate you .
do you know what that means ?
it means she &apos;s planning to forgive you
or she &apos;s desperately trying to find a way to forgive you .
and it doesn &apos;t matter if it was just sex .
she didn &apos;t want me to know , okay ?
and now i do , so don &apos;t .
all right . give me a pledget .
here you go .
shouldn &apos;t we go back on bypass and patch it ?
i mean , one slip , and this guy &apos;s as good as dead .
then i better not slip . okay , nobody breathe .
okay . cut it . let &apos;s see if it worked .
i don &apos;t see any blood .
crap . you did it .
i did , didn &apos;t i ?
all right . let &apos;s finish up .
thank you .
just so you know , she &apos;s tweaking about colleen
and all the others .
excuse me ?
i tried to talk her down , but it could get ugly --
mauled by a lion ugly .
you talked to your ex about my exes ?
yeah . i wanted some input .
no . no , no , no . he does not get to have that input
on our love life .
okay , excuse me .
colleen was an ortho nurse .
i worked with her every day for two years ,
and i had no idea that the two of you ...
she &apos;s seen you naked .
okay , fine .
what do you want to know ?
i want names .
her .
and her .
mm . and her , over by the soda machine .
yeah , twice .
okay , that &apos;s noelle . she &apos;s not even gay .
well , she was that night .
uh , also nancy in path , uh , meg in dermo ,
nurse tia and her sister ,
but , you know , not at the same time .
can i get something for the pain ?
uh , you are maxed out on pain meds , buddy .
of course i am .
i swear to god , paul , you &apos;re such a wussy .
oh , no one thinks that .
they should .
naomi does .
gotta be why she didn &apos;t tell me that kirby was a lion .
she knew i would &apos;ve freaked out .
we met on a dating site .
and when i saw her profile , she seemed ...
so adventurous ,
outdoorsy .
maybe i misrepresented myself a little bit .
pretended i was adventurous and outdoorsy .
when we met , i could tell she was disappointed .
but she stuck around ,
trying to see if the ...
guy i pretended to be was in here somewhere .
but when i shoved my arm
into kirby &apos;s mouth
and i felt him chomp down ,
i screamed .
i really , really screamed .
she knows the truth .
i am a ... wussy .
hang on . kirby was going for her
and not you ,
and you body blocked a lion ?
son , you are a hero .
you were the knight on the white horse
who stared into the dragon &apos;s jaws
and shoved his fist straight down the bastard &apos;s throat .
so ... i saved her ?
i &apos;ll tell you one thing ,
there &apos;s no way i would &apos;ve been able to do what you did .
really ?
oh , yeah . me-- i mean , me either .
you want to come talk to the wife ?
you just want an audience while you do your victory lap .
you bet i do .
you &apos;re not even a @-@ a little interested in why i know about a.n.d. ?
it &apos;s &apos; cause i have to decide today if
i make robbins operate on tommy &apos;s fistula
or i just let him die .
i didn &apos;t know you were there already .
yeah , &apos; cause you vaporized .
i &apos;m sorry . i @-@ i @-@ i was in surgery .
he ... he had such a good day yesterday .
i actually went online last night
and found a used crib ,
and then this morning , it &apos;s like ...
why can &apos;t he just have a few good days in a row ?
i don &apos;t know what to do . what--what am i supposed to do ?
i think it &apos;s time for you to--
to consider the quality of life that you want to offer tommy--
i don &apos;t need you to give me the friggin &apos; party line , alex .
i have robbins for that .
i need you to tell me what to do .
it &apos;s not my decision .
hey . hey . don &apos;t get all objective on me now .
it &apos;s not the time .
no , it is the time .
look , i &apos;m not his dad , i &apos;m--i &apos;m not your boyfriend ,
and you can &apos;t rely on me to help you make this decision .
wow . really ? now ?
in--in the worst moment of my life ,
you want to make sure i understand we &apos;re not a couple ?
yeah , &apos; cause you know what ?
this isn &apos;t the worst moment of your life .
the worst moment of your life is gonna be when tommy dies ,
or when he doesn &apos;t die and he &apos;s in pain and frustrated
because his body won &apos;t do what he wants it to do ,
or his brain doe &apos;t work like the other kids &apos; brains work ,
and you &apos;re spending half your life going to the doctor &apos;s office .
so what if he &apos;s not perfect ?
why do you all people think that just because he &apos;s blind ...
or impaired or--or not a freakin &apos; doctor ,
he &apos;s not worth something ?
the point is , it doesn &apos;t matter what the rest of us think .
at the end of the day ,
all that matters is what you think .
so decide--
that &apos;s what i &apos;m trying to do .
no , you &apos;re not .
look , you &apos;re standing at the nursery bawling ,
looking at all the healthy babies ,
feeling sorry for yourself .
stop it .
look , no one &apos;s saying that you didn &apos;t get dealt a crappy hand .
you did .
but now you &apos;ve gotta deal with it .
you . not me and you . you .
hey .
hey .
i brought you a treat .
thanks .
whatcha doin &apos; ?
whole organ decellularization .
i @-@ i wash the hearts with the solvent
for the next 12 hours , and then ...
it drains them of their cells
so teddy and i can reseed them .
so you &apos;re making new hearts from scratch .
yeah . kinda .
cool .
mrs. carroll , i just wanted to tell you
that your husband &apos;s surgery went ...
mrs. carroll , i &apos;m sorry to wake you .
mrs. carroll ? mrs. carroll ?
oh , no . oh , no . i need a gurney .
hey . we &apos;re doing the surgery .
but she doesn &apos;t want you involved .
yeah .
yeah . let me know how it goes .
hey .
you were a great doctor today .
he &apos;s gonna need a really tough mom .
and if hating you helps make her tough ...
yeah .
naomi ?
naomi , i &apos;m here . don &apos;t try to move .
you have about a million stitches .
he &apos;s gone .
no , i &apos;m right here .
i &apos;m right beside you .
kirby .
he &apos;s gone .
he &apos;s been my best friend for 15 years ,
and now they &apos;re gonna take him away ...
because of you .
i @-@ i saved you .
he freaked out because you were screaming like a little bitch .
i was screaming ke a bitch
because he was going for your throat .
uh , dr. avery and i are gonna
just let you two have some privacy .
my throat ? are you kidding me ?
that &apos;s how kirby plays .
that &apos;s how he hunts ,
because he &apos;s a lion
living in a 2 @-@ bedroom townhome
when he should be roaming the frigging savanna .
that lion is braver than any of us .
you &apos;d be dead if it weren &apos;t for me .
i @-@ i &apos;m a knight on a horse .
i slayed a dragon .
i am a hero , and we are so over .
that &apos;s disappointing .
but not surprising .
i mean , an idiot dating an idiot .
i have something i think you should see .
come with me .
oh , maybe . no .
what are you doing ?
trying to figure out how many dermatology fellows
my wife &apos;s banged .
for sure her .
ooh , yeah , that one , probably , too .
ooh . &quot; specializes in complete body rejuvenation . &quot;
yeah , i bet you do , cheryl .
you gotta get over it . everybody &apos;s got a past .
look , i &apos;m fine with her having a past .
it &apos;s just , i @-@ i didn &apos;t know i was working with it ,
and operating with it , seeing it in the cafeteria .
that woman wakes up every day ,
sees my face in her kitchen holding her kid ,
the kid that you and i ...
made together .
yeah , i guess ...
i guess that can &apos;t be easy for her .
easy ? knowing you &apos;ve been with the golden boy of this hospital ?
woman &apos;s in hell , torres .
okay .
i &apos;m a god .
it &apos;s killing her .
the nurse said your surgery was flawless ,
that now i have the heart of a 50 year old .
thank you , dr. altman .
martin--

when your surgery was finished ...
i went to look for your wife in the waiting room .
i thought that she had fallen asleep ,
so i tried to wake her , but ...
oh , no .
we performed c.p.r ..
i tried to resuscitate her myself ,
but she ...
she didn &apos;t make it .
they pronounced her dead a few minutes ago in the e.r ..
i am so sorry .

oh , i didn &apos;t see anything .
we both know that you did .
now you and i are scheduled for a whipple tomorrow .
i know that cristina is one of your own ,
so i understand if you prefer that i not scrub in with you .
i won &apos;t pretend
to understand the thing
you and cristina have going on ,
but i do know that , uh ,
affairs don &apos;t happen in a vacuum .
you &apos;re human and you made a human mistake .
you did a terrible thing .
it doesn &apos;t mean you &apos;re a terrible person .
we &apos;ve all heard the warnings ...
and we &apos;ve ignored them .
i am ...
i am a widow .
i am ...
a widow .
i am a w--
lobby ?
lobby .
parking lot ?
parking lot .
uh , you know what ?
i , um , i forgot that i have some charting to do .
so ... have a great night .
we push our luck .
each and every one of these items
was removed from a patient .
christmas lights ? come on .
where would you--
you don &apos;t want to know .
how did you--
very , very carefully .
ohh . okay .
it &apos;s pretty great , right ?
actually ...
yeah .
well , sometimes we have geniuses on our table
and sometimes we have idiots .
i for one
am partial to the idiot .
you don &apos;t get a lion &apos;s tooth from a genius .
we roll the dice .
okay . hey , here &apos;s the thing--
i do know about your exes ,
and frankly , sometimes it sucks .
okay .
and you know , i mean , i don &apos;t--i don &apos;t like knowing ,
and sometimes , you know , it--it drives me crazy .
i know .
so maybe there &apos;s a reason , you know , there &apos;s a--
there &apos;s a very good reason that i was--
i wasn &apos;t telling you about my exes .
you know , i was trying to spare you .
yeah , i understand .
you do ?
yeah , i do .
okay , &apos; cause i thought we were fighting .
oh , we totally are .
we play with fire .
look what daddy got you today , zola .
ooh , roar .
rawr .
and now put your head down . oh , there it is .
oh , well . roar .
don &apos;t do that .
well , you think it &apos;s cute when zola does it .
what is it ?
if you ever cheat on me , i &apos;ll kill you .
okay .
i mean it .
okay .
say it .
i will never cheat on you .
you want to talk about it ?
no .
okay .
it &apos;s human nature--
when we &apos;re told not to touch something ...
rawr .
we usually do ,
even if we know better .
maybe because
deep down ...
