第六季 第七集
Kalinda Sharma works closely on Mr. Agos' cases,
as well as being a social acquaintance.
But my report advises that the court's rulings are paramount.
ASA Polmar, you agree with these added restrictions?
We do, Your Honor.
All right, then the bail is approved
but only with these further restrictions applying.
And if you break the rules again, young man,
your bail will be revoked,
and you will spend the remainder of your time before trial behind bars.
Your Honor, we ask for an extension in the speedy trial provision.
No. Your Honor,
it is my client's constitutional right to a speedy trial.
Yes, and if your client hadn't had some involvement
in the disappearance of our key witness...
He had nothing to do with that disappearance.
He has flaunted the dictates of his bail,
Your Honor, again and again.
Wait, wait, wait. Shut up.
Now, how many days until trial?
58, Your Honor, as required by the speedy trial provision.
And how many more days do you need beyond that?
Your Honor, my client's reputation...
Damn it, Counselor!
Will everybody, everybody just answer what I ask. Okay?
How long an extension?
60 more days.
That will give us time to locate the missing witness, Trey Wagner.
If he's alive.
Yes, if he's still alive.
Finding Trey Wagner? That's a Hail Mary pass.
On that I agree.
Unfortunately, Mr. Polmar, I'm gonna deny your motion,
and the trial will begin on schedule in 58 days.
Damn it.
So I heard-- no extension?
Yeah.
What's your plan?
I'm formulating a plan.
Formulate it faster.
Let me do my job.
Cary was a good prosecutor.
He just wasn't ready for being deputy.
So did he resign willingly, or was he pressured?
Mr. Agos resigned for "Fraternizing with a coworker."
Come on, Geneva, the longer that I work here,
the more I realize there's always a reason behind the reason.
Cary was gone for a few weeks on administrative leave.
I never got the whole story.
Everybody guessed it contributed to his resignation.
When was this?
Three years ago.
And so you're the one who complained about Cary?
No, I just don't want my partner
to get blamed for missing evidence.
Cary lost evidence?
All I know is the chain of custody was intact
between us and the deputy SA.
We had a call from the crime lab asking where the evidence was.
Where what was? What was the evidence?
Cocaine.
Two kilos.
It never showed up at my lab.
Cary said that he delivered the cocaine to you.
To the lab, yeah, but there was no record.
And he never signed it out of the evidence room,
which made it all very suspicious.
Why wasn't there a bigger investigation?
Nobody wanted to point out deficiencies in the office.
Especially when it had to do with the Bishop case.
This is about Bishop?
Yeah. We never could prove it
'cause the evidence went missing.
Thanks.
Good day, huh?
Actually, pretty good.
You?
Well, I'm learning how to campaign.
It's like learning a new language.
Well, you got Castro worried.
He is not a happy boy these days.
Yeah, we're up by eight points,
but I don't know how long that'll last.
You know when something good happens to you, but...
it means something bad is gonna happen to someone else?
I think so. Why?
Come with me.
Cary is in trouble.
I know.
Worse trouble.
Okay. How?
I can't tell you.
But it could hurt you, the campaign.
You have to isolate yourself...
You can't tell me what happened?
I can't.
But believe me.
I got to go.
How are you with the office?
Good. It's odd to be back.
That's what Cary said.
It's going well, right? Cary's trial?
Yes.
Finn isn't ready. Speedy trial strategy's working for us.
There might be something coming down the pike on Cary.
I can't say what, but...
is there anything we overlooked?
I mean, a million things-- there always are.
What's your worry?
I don't know. Maybe nothing.
Your husband's on the news talking about you.
You know, it reminds me of what President Kennedy said
when he appointed his brother as Attorney General.
Something to the effect of: I can't see it as wrong
to give him a little legal experience...
Before he goes out to practice law.
Oh, that was back when you could joke in politics.
But to be clear... Alicia actually has more experience
than Robert F. Kennedy did when he was Attorney General.
You sound proud.
I am proud.
Let's turn then to a subject that's been all over the news lately:
militarizing law enforcement.
The rise of the warrior cop.
Yes.
Imagine something like Ferguson happening in Chicago--
would you feel comfortable
using police officers carrying automatic weapons,
driving around in Humvees?
No, I wouldn't say comfortable, no.
This is a civil rights issue, and I do...
Warren Plep.
Eli.
Hey. What's up?
What are you doing here, Warren?
Nothing. You?
Just supporting my boy.
So you just happened in off the street?
No. I know someone here.
A friend.
Who?
Matt.
Baloo.
Really?
Baloo? Like in The Jungle Book?
He's a producer here.
Good seeing you, Eli. Got to go.
You're still the king of petition drives, aren't you, Warren?
I still dabble. You need something?
I might.
Unless you're already employed.
Why would I be employed?
I'm just trying to figure out what you're doing here, Warren.
You don't go anywhere without good reason.
I've already told you my reason.
I have to go.
...protected police officers
under the doctrine of qualified immunity.
But that trend has reversed, hasn't it?
I don't...
quite know what you're referring to.
I'm thinking of this, uh, recent 2nd Circuit case.
SWAT team in Connecticut smashed down a door...
I wasn't prepared for it.
I looked like an idiot.
Eli.
You-you didn't look like an idiot.
I need a new personal attorney, Eli--
someone to keep me up to speed on these issues.
I'll make up a list.
Put Ramona on it, would you?
What?
Ramona Lytton.
Put her on the list.
The mother of the intern?
Well, she's not just the mother of the intern, she's a lawyer
and a family friend, and she needs a job.
When was the last time she practiced, Mr. Governor?
When's the last time Alicia did?
Put her on the list.
We have a problem.
Wait. Wait!
The problem is the opposite.
We have too much space now and too few lawyers.
So we lease it back.
Yes, but if we grow, we'll be overcharged.
Lease it out.
Lease out the 27th floor.
We've got 20 offices downstairs.
Lease them out to other businesses.
Well, all right, can we all have just a quiet discussion about leasing?
What happened?
We think a third candidate's joining the race.
I thought we were gonna ease her into it.
I changed my mind.
So, this is your office now?
It's nice.
Aren't we past the filing deadline?
How can anybody be joining the race?
Well, if you gather 50,000 signatures,
you can run by petition.
And is anyone doing that?
Warren Plep
is a DC petition bundler.
He gathers signatures for petitions
in California and New York.
I saw him at the CBS studios during Peter's interview.
Why? Why was he there?
Well, he wouldn't say, but...
my guess is Frank Prady.
The commentator?
Yes.
And that would not be good?
No, it would be terrible.
He's a brand.
Yes, and he's a bigger brand than you,
so we've got to do some polling.
It might mean nothing.
It could be for another office.
Yes, but we've looked back over his broadcast commentary
for the last three months,
and he's disgusted with the murder rate in Chicago
and he hates how Castro's fighting it.
We've been called back into court, so we're heading out.
On your case?
Yeah. Should be about an hour.
Do you know what it's about?
No,
no-- maybe it's good news.
Maybe they're dropping the charges.
Good luck.
So, what do we do now?
We find out if it's true.
And how do we do that?
You go to Prady, and you ask for his endorsement.
What?
He's endorsed candidates in other races.
If he does endorse you, then clearly he's not running.
If he doesn't, then... there might be some problem there.
If he runs, I lose?
Well, anything can happen, b...
Yes, you lose.
Okay,
here we are again.
What's going on, Counselor?
It's not us, Your Honor.
It seems the ASA has something up his sleeve.
A Proof of Other Crimes charge, Your Honor.
Your Honor, uh, that is just wrong.
My client is innocent,
and the state's attorney is conducting a vendetta.
We're not conducting a vendetta.
Mr. Agos used to be an ASA, Your Honor,
and while he was working here,
he was also secretly working for Lemond Bishop.
What?
That is ridiculous.
Top drug dealer...
And that is slanderous,
Your Honor.
God Almighty,
stop it!
I'm the one in control here.
What evidence do you have?
We have evidence that Mr. Agos, when a deputy ASA,
buried evidence against his one-time client,
Bishop, allowing Mr. Bishop to avoid prosecution.
Now... the evidence against him was two kilos of cocaine,
which went missing after the defendant, Mr. Agos,
removed it from the evidence room.
Now, the prosecution merely asks
that they be allowed to use this evidence at trial.
Bring this evidence tomorrow, and I will hear on this motion.
Your Honor...
No. Everybody shut up.
I already ruled. That's it.
Governor Florrick's office.
Ramona?
Alicia, I thought that was you.
Oh, my Gosh.
What has it been, ten years? You look great.
Thank you.
What are you doing here?
A job interview.
Can you believe it?
For the legal job here.
That's great.
They need someone like you.
Where are you coming from?
Where am I...?
What firm?
Nowhere. Home.
Been raising two kids, you know.
Yes. Of course. I'm sorry.
Don't be.
It's my first interview in, um...
12 years.
That's great. You'll be great.
That's exactly what I did.
I know. I'm modeling my career after yours.
Uh, don't do that.
How's Anton?
We divorced last year.
He's in Nashville, I think.
Oh, Ramona, I'm sorry.
I keep stepping right in it.
No, you're great.
Well, I probably...
Sure.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Good luck.
He wants to meet too today.
Okay, good.
Why do you two look so nervous?
We don't want him in the race.
I know. Neither do I.
We have a few issues we'd like you to talk about.
His mother was attacked a year ago at her retirement community,
and she was left with 20 stitches in her forehead.
Okay. So...
you want me to bring that up?
No, try to talk about crimes against seniors
and how you're gonna push for stronger prosecutions.
That's a bit unsubtle, isn't it?
Alicia,
you're not writing a poem-- you're practicing politics.
Also, try to scare him off from running by suggesting
how much money you have in your PAC.
How do I do that?
You're asking for his endorsement.
It makes sense that you'd bring up your grassroots support.
And don't mention his Supreme Court book.
He was disappointed with the sales.
Okay, this is getting silly.
Just set it up. I'll be good.
Also, he's a fan of history.
Cold War history.
I selected a few quotes.
No.
So Mr. Agos insisted on taking over all of Lemond Bishop's cases?
Yes.
And this was when he first
joined the State's Attorney's Office?
No, when he was elevated to deputy.
And had he shown
any interest in the Bishop cases previously?
Cary checked in with me pretty regularly,
wanting to know how far along the investigation was,
if we were building a strong case.
And what did you tell Mr. Agos?
The bail restrictions. I have to keep 30 feet between us.
I know. I need your help on this.
They're trying to imply that Cary was secretly working
for Bishop when he was at the SA's Office.
You're kidding.
No, it's all supposition and happenstance,
but it's effective.
Thank you. Nothing further.
See what you can dig up to battle it.
Counselor, excuse me.
Sorry to break up the important meeting
you're having back there, but we're waiting.
Yes, Your Honor. My apologies.
Ms. Pine, uh, you were already at the SA's Office
when Cary joined?
I was.
And do you remember the reason
that he left private practice to come over?
Calls for speculation.
Damn right. Try again.
Would you say that Cary is a competitive person?
Your Honor.
We've already established that she is his colleague,
not his therapist.
The prosecution's direct suggested
that my client took the Bishop case for no reason.
It is within the scope to show that
he took a high-profile case in order to prove himself.
And now she's testifying.
Mr. Agos is free to take the stand
and explain his own state of mind.
Yes. Thank you, Your Honor.
Ms. Pine, how long did you run the investigation
into Lemond Bishop's drug organization?
Almost two years.
And during that time, how many charges
did you file against Mr. Bishop?
None.
Really? None?
So isn't it likely
that they gave the Bishop cases
to somebody who could do better?
Objection. Argumentative.
No. No, overruled.
I want to hear it.
Yes.
It's possible.
Alicia. In here.
Sorry. I was just getting changed.
No, thank you for meeting with me.
Are you kidding? I'm a fan.
Don't make fun of my cheeks. It's makeup for camera.
Wow, Frank.
A bit of a sweet tooth?
No. Do you like cookies?
You have to have some. Please.
Uh, two tins. Three tins, at least.
I'm all right. Thank you, though.
Oh, it's these ladies online.
They have a-a fan club.
And they get it into their heads that I like certain things.
Last year they thought I was getting too much sun,
so they sent me Panama hats.
Well, you must have a lot of fans.
Well, not as many as you.
I'm sure that's not true.
No, I'm sure it is.
Well, we're both popular then.
Glad we settled that.
So...
Yes. You must be wondering
why I asked to meet with you.
No, my producer said,
and I think it's a great idea.
Oh, he-he did? Really? What did he say?
That you wanted to pitch yourself for an interview.
No, actually.
But thank you.
The state's attorney's race,
I'm running.
Yes, I know. Condolences.
I mean, congratulations.
Thank you.
And I was hoping to encourage you to...
...to endorse me.
I hate just asking,
but I... Well, I just did.
So there.
That is different.
And just so you know a little bit about what I stand for,
Chicago has one of the worst records in the country
prosecuting federal gun crimes,
which means the SA's Office has to pick up the slack.
And... I don't know if you've seen the statistics
on crime against the elderly,
but I would really want to beef up
on penalties for elder crime.
Great. Good.
Just so you know, that's not true.
About my mom getting beaten up.
It was another lady in her retirement community.
The press got it wrong.
Well, no, I didn't know that.
But it doesn't matter anyway. Uh...
I still feel bad for that... lady,
and, um, I believe it.
The elderly crime...
thing.
He gave you cookies?
Yes. And an interview spot.
But no endorsement?
No. He said he wanted to talk more in the interview.
I'm not good at this, guys.
I'm bad at asking for things.
I don't like asking...
Alicia, listen to me,
you're running for office. The very nature of your job
is asking for things.
Votes, money, help. It's a talent.
That's how politicians get you to love them,
not by giving you something
but asking for something.
So you just got to get over your...
feeling that you're above all this.
The real question is, do we do the interview?
It could be a setup.
He uses a bad interview as a springboard
to launch his own campaign.
It's an audience. We have to.
Yeah.
All right. We prep for hardball questions.
We make him think we're going in soft
and then we go for the jugular.
Okay. All right, I'll handle the prep.
I'll go and, uh...
Where did you recover the two kilos of cocaine,
Officer Sprayberry?
Stash house on Kinzie Street tied to Lemond Bishop.
And did you ever see the cocaine that you believed belonged
to Mr. Bishop again after you checked it in?
No.
Do you...
normally see evidence again
after you check it in?
Standard operating procedure
is for the recovering officer to transport it for testing.
But Mr. Agos insisted on
taking this cocaine to the lab.
Yes. He said he needed a quick check,
off the books,
so they could link it to Bishop.
And you let him.
Well, deputy SAs have a lot of clout.
And he said this was the fastest way to take down Bishop.
And was it?
No.
Once the cocaine disappeared,
the case disappeared.
Thank you.
Nothing further, Your Honor.
Be honest with me,
how do I defend against this?
I don't know.
Well, what did you do?
I checked the cocaine out to take it to the lab myself.
Why?
To expedite it.
Cary, this testimony is killing us.
I know.
Cary Agos.
It's me.
Where are you?
Turn around.
This is crazy.
I know.
30 feet.
You saw what they were doing in court?
Yeah.
I also know who you're protecting.
Who?
Peter.
That's why you broke the rules at the State's Attorney's Office
and took the cocaine to the lab.
Because Peter asked you to.
He was eyeing the governorship
and he knew that a Bishop conviction would help.
That's supposition, Kalinda.
No, it isn't.
You have to defend yourself, Cary.
He did nothing wrong.
Then subpoena him
and have him say that.
He has nothing to do with the coke going missing.
Well, neither do you.
But they'll crucify him.
Cary, they're crucifying you.
Look, you have to tell them that you were under orders.
I can't.
Then I will.
Kalinda, no.
Kalinda.
Kalinda?
30 feet, Cary.
Ramona, welcome.
How was your first day of school? You find the lunchroom?
No, but that's okay. I...
It's the next floor down.
Just off the elevator.
Okay. Great.
Um, there's something that came across my desk...
The paperwork for the new offices. Don't worry.
That's not time sensitive. I have to take this.
Do you mind? Yep.
What? Mm-hmm.
Why am I being subpoenaed?
Because Diane wants to drag you
into this Proof of Other Crime nonsense.
You think this has to do with the Supreme Court rejection?
Of course it has to do with the Supreme Court rejection.
It says here that you ordered Cary
to violate evidence-handling rules
in order to push a high-profile prosecution.
This is a nightmare.
We need to file a motion based on privilege.
Yes. Good idea.
I don't...
I'm gonna meet with Cary. I know he doesn't want to go there.
I know that.
How about that for a first day, huh?
I'll have one of the paralegals help you
file a motion to quash based on privilege.
I don't think we should do that.
What do you mean?
Why?
Ramona, uh, let's discuss this.
No, wait. I want to know why.
They're expecting us to do it.
They want us
to argue that any conversation between the then SA
and Mr. Agos is privileged work product.
They want it to look like you're covering something up.
So... don't.
Okay.
What would you do?
Go on offensive.
No matter what Mr. Agos was told by his superior,
it doesn't excuse him from having committed a crime.
I can file a motion to quash based on relevance.
The governor isn't hiding anything.
He is busy.
And the defense is merely trying to stall
by dragging him into this.
Do it.
Thank you, Mr. Governor.
Oh, and, um... I wouldn't talk to Cary.
They'll use it against you.
Not bad, huh?
We'll see.
Isn't your law partner facing drug conspiracy
charges, Mrs. Florrick?
He is. But those charges have not been proven yet.
Never accept the premise of the question.
Your answer can be edited down to "He is."
Always jump back to your pivot.
My pivot?
Yeah. This is the most important advice
I'm ever gonna give you, Alicia.
Questions are for dopes.
They are?
Yes. Say it.
Questions are for dopes.
Isn't that the point of an interview?
No, the point of an interview is to put you on the spot,
and your point is to pivot back to your message.
And what is my message?
Castro is ruining the department.
Now, Mrs. Florrick, your law partner
is facing drug conspiracy charges.
Why shouldn't voters trust you based on who you associate with?
Because my partner is innocent and the current state's attorney
is pursuing a vendetta against him to get back at me.
Good. Stick with it-- message discipline.
But doesn't your law firm also represent Lemond Bishop,
the biggest drug dealer in Chicago?
Alleged drug dealer.
Come on, Alicia-- Lemond Bishop.
In our legal system,
everyone deserves a vigorous defense.
But not everyone deserves you.
Unlike the current state's attorney,
I've seen both sides of the courtroom.
I know how and when the system is abused.
Good. Um, don't cross your legs under the table.
Why?
Well, it keeps you from sitting up straight.
So cross at the ankles.
Now, let's talk about the abortion
your son got for his underage girlfriend.
Is anything wrong, Mrs. Florrick?
Is this you talking, or Prady?
Prady.
And always use his first name-- Frank.
Well, Frank,
I obviously find this situation very difficult.
My son...
No.
You want my real answer?
Sure.
How dare you?
How in the world does it possibly
impact my work as a prosecutor
to ask about my family's most vulnerable moments?
Well, it's... This city is suffering from the worst
murder spree in its history,
and you're asking me about my son's abortion?
Are you frigging kidding me?
Okay. Let's unpack that.
Good second half, though I'm not sure about "Frigging."
And bad first half.
You can't personalize it, Alicia.
It's not Frank.
Well, if he asks about Zach, then it is about Frank.
Well, the passion is good,
you just have to control it.
People don't necessarily hear the words,
but they get a sense of it from
your tone of voice and your arm movements.
So try to keep them in check.
Gotcha.
Okay.
Have you heard these rumors that your husband
is sleeping with an intern in the governor's office?
Again, this type of politics of personal destruction...
Cliche.
Again, this type of... horse...
Yeah, you can't...
This kind of B.S. is why people don't run for office.
It's why I almost didn't run.
And then I realized if I didn't,
only people like Castro would.
Good, good. And don't look at the camera.
Act as if it's just the two of you talking.
And watch out for the second camera.
Sometimes, in the middle of a question,
they'll cut to you and try to catch you off guard.
And don't be afraid to say
"I don't agree with your characterization."
Okay.
Anything else?
Am I ready?
For now.
You're a bundle of optimism.
Your Honor, Cary Agos was only following the orders
of his superior, Peter Florrick,
who was state's attorney at that time.
That's why we subpoenaed him.
That he is governor is immaterial.
We're only interested in his actions as the state's attorney.
Counselor.
Yeah?
It's customary at this point for you to say something.
If the governor's counsel is arguing
that Peter Florrick held some sort of privilege...
I'm not.
Or even had qualified immunity...
I'm not saying that, either.
Well, then, what are you saying?
Anyone? ASA Polmar?
Qualified immunity doesn't apply here.
A little louder.
Just spill it out.
Your Honor. Sir.
Ms. Lockhart is desperate to make this hearing about
Governor Florrick's refusal to testify.
I'm not desperate about anything.
She wants me to put up some shield--
privilege, immunity-- so that when he doesn't take the stand,
you can draw a negative inference from that fact.
The defense has to prove Governor Florrick
can offer some testimony that would impact her client's guilt.
But he can't.
Mr. Agos isn't being accused of transporting drugs
against police regulations.
He's being accused of stealing drugs.
I must prove one...
And even the defense isn't accusing the governor
of ordering Mr. Agos to steal these drugs,......
my client has nothing to contribute here.
Accordingly, we respectfully submit
the subpoena be quashed. Immediately.
And, Your Honor, we... respectfully disagree.
Proof of other crimes presented during trial could have
an enormous negative impact on a defendant.
Accordingly, the defendant deserves every opportunity
to have such evidence excluded.
In this instance, however,
I cannot compel the testimony of a witness,
let alone a sitting governor.
The motion to quash is granted.
Prosecution has leave to introduce
evidence of Mr. Agos' involvement
in the disappearance of the cocaine at trial.
That's it.
You can go. Next.
Well done.
Okay, they said, uh, 20 more seconds.
Uh, they'll introduce you in D.C.,
so you won't hear that here.
Okay, here we go.
That's right, Jim.
First the husband, now the wife.
I can always ask her.
Where do you find the time, Alicia?
The time?
Yes, you-you started your own law firm, you have responsibilities
that come with your husband's job, there's family, and now
you're running for state's attorney.
Well... yes.
Um, how do you prioritize?
Family first, of course.
Okay,
let's start with your family.
Oh, no,
um, what I was going to say,
is like most busy people, I triage.
How-How do your, uh, how do your husband and kids
feel about you taking on this SA race?
Fine.
Peter, uh, has done the job,
so he's been really helpful.
And my children, growing up in this family,
understand how important it is to do public service.
Is that something you talk about explicitly,
sitting around the dinner table, or is it a lesson
they get by Florrick family osmosis?
We have, uh, dinner together,
like other families. We talk.
Oh, I'm sure.
I-I was just interested...
if you like to sit down and discuss criminal justice
over the chicken, or gab about reality TV.
I don't watch reality TV.
Or-Or whatever. My dad was a police officer,
uh, which I thought was fascinating,
but he never wanted to talk about that at home.
For him, it was all Chicago Bears, all the time.
What the hell?
She's braced for hardball. She'll relax into it.
One challenge in being a prosecutor and a mom, I imagine,
will be seeing the absolute worst side of the world
you're sending your kids into.
Does that worry you?
To the contrary, I think it will help me remember
what's at stake every time we try an accused criminal.
Something that the current state's attorney is failing to do.
Okay.
Is that part of the logic of your campaign?
Replacing the-the prosecutor machismo
with the perspective of someone
who's spent the majority of her life raising kids?
I'm sorry,
I disagree with your characterization of me as
someone who spent the majority of her life raising kids.
Oh, I apologize. I-I didn't mean it as an insult.
Oh, no, uh, there's no need... to apologize. Um...
I'm proud of being a mother.
I just... I've done a lot of other things.
Oh, God, oh, God.
It's okay. It's okay, we can move on from this.
It was like watching a ship go down.
And I couldn't do anything about it.
It was like my-my mouth was on automatic pilot.
He Katie Couric-ed you.
You think it was planned? Serving up softballs?
If she answers them earnestly, she looks like a lightweight.
If she doesn't answer them, she looks like a prig?
I need something to drink.
Wait, we have something to tell you.
I did some intel.
Prady is running.
How do you know?
I talked to a friend in Warren Plep's office.
They're gathering signatures for a Prady run.
And they're doing polling.
Then we're sunk.
No, no, not yet.
There's always a plan "B."
We dirty him up. Fast.
We scare him into not running.
With what?
Well, leave that to us.
Okay.
I'm going home to get drunk.
That's a joke, right?
It is. I know.
Don't joke.
Yeah?
Your bank account balance...
Okay. Who are you?
I'm Kalinda Sharma.
You work at the crime lab.
And that is your bank account balance.
And as you can see, you received $30,000 six months ago...
I'm going to go to the police unless you answer my questions.
What questions?
Well, this $30,000 couldn't have come
from your salary at the crime lab, so who paid you?
I won the money.
Oh. How?
At a riverboat casino.
Oh. Which one?
Tell me the truth, Liana, or this is gonna get worse.
I never did anything like that before.
Like what?
It was my cousin.
He knew the drugs were coming through there, and he wanted them back.
Who's your cousin?
I can't tell you that.
You want to take the fall for this yourself?
I don't know where he is.
He took off because he was scared of Lemond Bishop.
Tell me his name?
Trey Wagner.
Where is he?
I don't know.
I got to go.
Look, do you stay in touch with him?
No. Good-bye.
"Gary, Indiana."
Hello, Trey.
No.
I'm not here for Bishop.
Lady, whenever I meet you, there's trouble.
Then let's talk.
"Sovereignty for Me, Not for Thee."
It's a Law Review article Frank Prady wrote as a student.
It's about how Israeli settlements in the West Bank
violate the Geneva Convention.
Really?
It'll kill him with Jewish voters.
And evangelical Christians.
No.
No, he's right. The evangelicals will be turned off, too.
No, we're not using this.
Why?
Because we don't even know if he still believes this.
What does that matter?
Because it does.
And it has nothing to do with the state's attorney's race.
Alicia, part of running is about electability.
Attitude toward Israel goes to electability.
We're not getting involved with this.
She's right.
Let's have the PAC do it.
No. We're not giving it to the PAC.
We are not using it.
Look...
I'm learning a lot from you guys,
but you need to learn something from me, too.
He'll run, you'll lose.
Maybe.
What do you think? You know her better than I do.
We can't use it.
We can't slip it to the PAC, either.
There might be another way.
Finn Polmar.
You're looking for Trey Wagner?
I might be. Who am I talking to?
I found him.
He might be willing to testify.
Against Cary Agos?
No. Lemond Bishop.
Get Castro now.
Why would he, um, testify against Bishop?
For two reasons.
He feels guilty about framing Cary Agos, who did nothing wrong.
Well, how exactly did he frame Cary?
He turned the recording on
only for what the cops wanted to hear.
Okay, and what's the second reason?
You're going to grant him immunity?
And you don't want to tell me your name?
I'm only interested in justice.
Agos is innocent, Bishop is guilty.
Where are you right now?
I'm with Trey. You want to talk to him?
Yes, I would.
Trey, you're on.
So, we need to offer Wagner immunity and protection,
and then he'll testify against Bishop.
I thought he was giving us Cary Agos.
Well, he said Agos didn't do anything.
You know, he only offered us the lawyer
because he was afraid of turning on Bishop.
But now he's turning on Bishop.
Well, his sister's Christian. She's convinced him to come clean.
Okay, but can he connect Bishop
to the $1.3 million in heroin?
No, no, no, he said that was his.
He and a few other crew members were selling that on their own.
But he can connect Bishop to other drug deliveries.
He can connect them the way he connected Agos?
Well, he's turning on his boss.
No, he's admitting that he lied about Agos.
Why do we trust him now?
Because we want Bishop.
Yes. We want Agos to get us to Bishop.
That's the strategy. That should continue.
Cary Agos is innocent.
No, Trey says that he's innocent.
Maybe he's lying to us now.
What's going on, Jim?
Nothing. I think we should stick to the original strategy.
Is this about your campaign?
I think you should reconsider what you just said.
You don't care about Bishop.
You care about Alicia Florrick.
Get out of my office.
You're kidding me.
Nope.
When?
Roughly four hours ago.
Oh, my God.
I thought I was having a weird day.
Why? What was your day?
No, no, no, no, no, we're gonna stick with you.
What...? Why?
I was disagreeing with Castro about trial strategy.
On Cary's case?
Can't tell you.
I can't. I resigned, but it's still confidential.
I think you will tell me after three more drinks.
Maybe.
Wow. So, what are you gonna do?
Make some money.
Open my own practice.
Do you have office space?
No.
No. I'll probably go looking tomorrow.
I may have something.
Office space. Where?
The 27th floor of our building. We're renting it out.
I don't know. It's a little bit incestuous.
If we were siblings.
I can get you a deal.
I'll think about it.
So, how was your day?
Well...
Let me be clear.
I am pro-Israel and proud of it.
So I have to disagree vehemently with anyone who still harbors
大学国际法报道
a youthful fascination with the Palestinian cause...
Got to be kidding me.
SA Castro made these remarks earlier today in response...
Did you see this?
Yeah. I'm watching it now.
I told you not to leak that article.
Alicia, I didn't. Castro did.
And you expect me to believe that?
Look, we all do the same searches, we all find the same dirt.
This is a good thing.
This hurts Prady without reflecting on you.
...for the Palestinian cause...
You saw the news?
I did.
So, what do we do now?
Well, I don't know if there's anything to do.
I have to find out if this was Elfman,
or if Eli pushed him.
What are you talking about?
The leak of Prady's anti-Israel article.
No. Trey Wagner died in a car accident last night,
along with his cousin--
the two people who could help Cary and harm Bishop.
We're going to meet the new prosecutor now.
I am so sorry.
Good luck.
Yes?
Frank Prady is here for you.
Excuse me?
Frank Prady. He knows he doesn't have an appointment,
but he asked if you have ten minutes.
I... O-Okay.
Hold on one second.
You know what? Just send him... send him back.
Oh. Mr. Prady.
How are you?
Uh, fine.
Uh, no, actually, not fine.
Oh. I'm sorry. Why is that? Can I get you something to drink?
No. No. Uh... I've been losing friends this morning.
Why?
This article. This, uh,
thought project from a while back--
uh, it's been sent to the press...
Let me be clear.
I am pro-Israel.
Yes, I, uh... I saw it.
I don't like losing friends.
I don't either.
Uh, you asked me to endorse you.
Yes, I would love your endorsement.
I'm disgusted by the personal nature of politics.
I hate campaigns being treated like bad reality shows.
How lives are exposed,
and human beings treated like...
commodities.
Yeah. I hate it, too.
So...
I've decided to run for state's attorney.
The only way to change it is to have skin in the game.
So I can't endorse you.
Uh, I have resigned from CBS.
Uh, I intend to run by petition.
You could have called me to say that.
Yes, I could have,
but I wanted to give you my reasons.
This-this leak of my youthful views has changed my mind.
You're such a hypocrite.
Excuse me?
You've known for days now that you are running.
You had me jumping through hoops for your endorsement
when you knew.
You had Warren Plep out there
getting you signatures, doing your polling.
So don't act like you're trying to change the system.
You are the system.
Plep was doing that on his own. He was the one pitching me.
I think we're done here, Mr. Prady.
I didn't decide to run until this leak today.
Eli, he's running. He's in my office.
I intended to support you until I discovered
it was your team that gave my article to Castro.
Is there something else you need, Mr. Prady?
No.
Good luck, Mrs. Florrick.
Yup, it was fun. See you out there.
