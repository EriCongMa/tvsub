this is derrick &apos;s in @-@ house investigator , blake , from d.c.
you a friend of leela &apos;s ?
i &apos;m a who ?
um , sorry . kalinda &apos;s .
whatever games you &apos;re playing ,
you play with her . i &apos;m too busy , okay ?
you know there was something weird about that case ,
that something got buried . pitted .
evidence . or testimony .
mr. childs , you were under intense pressure
to convict someone for the northbrook killings , weren &apos;t you ?
it &apos;s my job to prosecute criminals , so there &apos;s always pressure .
mr. childs , you were under intense pressure
to convict someone for the northbrook killings , weren &apos;t you ?
it &apos;s my job to prosecute criminals .
there &apos;s always pressure .
did you give an interview on june 11th ,
promising &quot; swift accountability and justice &quot; for the sniper ?
i don &apos;t recall .
chicago tribune , op @-@ ed : &quot; chicagoans need not fear ,
this case will be solved by the end of the month &quot; ?
and it was .
even if corners were cut ?
they were not .
you may not have been aware they were .
this is my department .
i have to be aware of everything . and i am .
you had wyatt stevens arrested ?
wyatt stevens was arrested because wyatt stevens was guilty .
you stand by the prosecution of wyatt stevens .
i stand by every prosecution this office has taken on in my tenure .
unlike earlier holders of my office ,
i do not prosecute without a good faith belief
that the defendant is guilty .
i think you &apos;re right . go with &quot; unfair prejudice . &quot;
my co @-@ counsel wants to go with
prejudice and cumulative evidence .
no , no , no , no , not with judge hale .
she hates a fire hose defense .
but this is good .
&quot; prejudice as policy . &quot; that &apos;s a very nice turn of phrase .
thank you .
you might use trent v. paddock .
it &apos;s a good 403 separation .
okay . i &apos;ll look into it .
what &apos;s up , eli ?
alicia , don &apos;t leave yet .
i &apos;m late for work .
just wait a second , eli .
um , the settlement in the , in the sniper case , the northbrook sniper ?
did ... did you depose childs ?
um ... peter , i can &apos;t . i &apos;m under a gag order .
i can &apos;t say anything .
is it bad ?
so am i supposed to worry they &apos;re still asking for $ 8 million ?
yep .
javier , you wouldn &apos;t be happy unless you had something to worry about .
look , we &apos;ve got a good judge , a good motion ,
and we succeeded in combining our defenses ,
so we can &apos;t be used against each other .
okay .
i just ... this is getting to me .
once more into the breach , eh ?
yep .
i &apos;d like to argue the unfair prejudice motion , andre .
certainly . and i &apos;ll take cumulative .
actually , i was thinking we &apos;d be stronger with just one .
judge hale doesn &apos;t like a fire hose defense .
really . and how do we know that ?
all rise .
good morning .
judge hale has been called away for a family emergency ,
so i will be presiding .
we &apos;ll be hearing pretrial motions today ?
that &apos;s right , your honor .
and if i may say so , welcome aboard .
well , thank you , mr. deerfield .
we got you out of the lecture room , i see .
only to argue a case i believe in .
and yet i seem to see you &apos;re outnumbered today .
yes , yes . i do feel a bit like david .
i think that &apos;s a bit of a stretch , mr. deerfield .
i found something to worry about .
chicago !
move it , chicago !
what happened to hale ?
some family emergency . do you know anything about quinn ?
i &apos;ll see what i can get .
can we get some medical attention down here ?
pull her up !
your honor , that is cell phone video
of the death of five young concertgoers .
it is essential evidence--
it is prejudicial evidence .
well , how is it prejudicial ?
the families are suing two people .
jay hawke , aka d.j. javier berlin ,
for overselling his concert ,
and mr. brownback &apos;s security firm
for allowing too many people in .
at the very minimum , this video shows an oversold concert .
no , at the very minimum , it shows a selectively edited ,
highly prejudicial video intended to inflame the jury .
counselor ... what are you wearing ?
your honor ?
what are you wearing ?
what ... what are those clothes ?
i think they &apos;re ralph lauren .
yes , thank you . no , i mean ... your pants .
you &apos;re ... you &apos;re wearing pants .
yes ... it &apos;s a pantsuit .
i see that .
in my courtroom , i require the male lawyers to wear ties ,
and the female lawyers , skirts .
am i making myself clear ?
i can &apos;t believe it . does he do this in every court ?
he can &apos;t do this to every female lawyer .
my guess is you &apos;re right .
so why me ? what did i do ?
you &apos;re being taxed .
why ?
the childs deposition .
what &apos;s going on ? peter mentioned that , too .
it was in mcgowan &apos;s column this morning .
the deposition ? how ?
it was leaked .
and they think i leaked it .
to hurt childs and help peter .
that &apos;s the spin in the column .
look , you &apos;re his wife , one of the only few people in the room ...
we didn &apos;t win a single motion .
i &apos;m meeting with our co @-@ counsel now to rethink strategy .
so what &apos;s our endgame ?
we want to keep our client &apos;s exposure to the insurance limit :
half a million .
i don &apos;t imagine the plaintiff will accept a half million ?
not after today .
okay . do the best you can ; anything to get the settlement down .
uh , do you need blake on this ?
no , no ... kalinda &apos;s good .
oh , alicia , one more thing .
regarding this , uh , leaked deposition .
i had nothing to do with it .
all three of us were there .
it &apos;s just that ... the firm is in a precarious position on this ,
so it would be helpful if your husband didn &apos;t exploit it .
okay .
if you have any sway there .
she didn &apos;t do it ?
it &apos;s unlike her .
uh , you phoned : my co @-@ counsel , mr. baylon , is here ?
hello . i didn &apos;t know it was you .
miss crozier .
yes .
remember , from last year . we were on opposite sides .
i do .
oh , i &apos;m so sorry . i &apos;ve forgotten your name .
alicia .
alicia , right . mm @-@ hmm .
that &apos;s so funny ; we &apos;ll be on the same side this time .
i don &apos;t understand .
i &apos;ve been asked to
replace mr.baylon as the counsel for the security firm ?
he &apos;s having some surgery .
he &apos;s ... no , i @-@ i just saw him .
i know . it was all very last @-@ minute .
it &apos;s-- i-- we &apos;re all kind of shocked .
but i &apos;m here ... and raring to go .
courtney ... get mr. baylon on the phone .
deviated septum .
he gets elective surgery one day before the trial
because he doesn &apos;t like the judge .
oh , alicia , he said you were expecting him ,
so i put him in your office .
hello .
you seem to spend more time here
than you did when you actually worked here .
you still sharing courtney ?
everything &apos;s the same .
okay . well , i don &apos;t want to delay the drama .
you &apos;ve been served .
i &apos;ve ... for what ?
state &apos;s attorney has asked me
to head up an inquiry to look into the leak of mr. childs &apos; deposition .
now , i &apos;m going to try and expedite this , alicia ,
so that you don &apos;t have a cloud hanging over your head .
thank you so much .
you &apos;re welcome .
personally , i know that you would never break the law in this manner ,
so i &apos;m sure it &apos;s just a formality .
and if it &apos;s not ,
then we &apos;ll be pursuing a disbarment hearing .
see you soon .
you &apos;re not getting anything from me , eli .
i &apos;m not burning my source .
source ?
or sources .
you know why i love politics ?
people make sense .
they do things that make sense .
that &apos;s why this leak bothers me .
it doesn &apos;t make any strategic sense .
it hurts childs , because it makes his office look bad .
it hurts peter , because it places his wife under suspicion ,
and then i realized : that &apos;s the point .
someone wants to hurt them both .
and that got me thinking .
childs and florrick have their hands around each other &apos;s throats .
what a perfect time for a third person to enter the race .
so who is it ?
give me a quote .
i &apos;ll see if they want to respond .
they ?
give me a quote . i &apos;ll see if he , she , it wants to respond .
&quot; these kind of dirty tricks--
even if perpetrated by an unannounced third candidate--
are despicable . &quot;
got it .
she had my hand .
i told her ,
&quot; whatever you do , don &apos;t let go &quot;
and that &apos;s her ?
my fiancee . yes .
juliette .
the crowd was just so--
it was like fighting the ocean .
i couldn &apos;t hold her . she went down .
parents wanted an open casket , but ...
the way she was trampled ...
i didn &apos;t know a person could look like that .
i &apos;m sorry , mr. dylan ,
but i need you to be strong for a little while longer ,
because the defense has to ask you a few questions .
objection !
sure . if you want . sustained . your witness .
mr. dylan , i &apos;m very sorry for your loss .
wish your clients were .
i think they are .
speaking of my clients ,
they weren &apos;t the first ones you sued , were they ?
objection ! your honor !
approach the bench .
your honor , the plaintiff first tried to sue the real culprit : the venue .
oh , come on .
the venue staff opened the exit doors .
that &apos;s what sparked the stampede and the only reason we &apos;re being sued
is because the venue went bankrupt after the incident .
these are honorable people .
i &apos;m not going to stand by silently and let her disparage them .
i- i &apos;m sorry . is that an argument ?
your honor ,
who my client sued or failed to sue is immaterial here .
they are suing the codefendants now . that &apos;s all that matters .
the objection is sustained .
further questions of any previous suit is off @-@ limits .
now , step back .
i said , step back .
so , is my skirt short enough ?
next time , ask that in front of the court reporter , ma &apos;am .
and we will discuss an appropriate fine .
now , step back .
put me in , coach .
our strategy was to blame the venue on the panic .
we can &apos;t blame security because they &apos;re our co @-@ defendant .
there &apos;s someone else you can blame .
who ?
the victims .
do you have a problem with that ?
you mean , as a lawyer or as a person ?
it &apos;s a rave .
i &apos;m sure the victims must have contributed to the panic .
the jury may not love it , but they &apos;ll believe it .
i &apos;ll get on it .
he didn &apos;t get a seat at the gala .
he didn &apos;t ? no !
courtney ? can you get kalinda for me , please ?
sure .
and mr. gold phoned .
oh , i &apos;ll call him back later .
what &apos;s going on ?
oh , nothing . it &apos;s the gala . the bar fund @-@ raiser .
the partners bought five tables . everyone wants to see who &apos;s invited .
and ziegler wasn &apos;t .
ziegler from tax litigation ? why not ?
well ... you know , probably means he &apos;s being laid off .
ah . um ...
oh , don &apos;t worry ,
none of the second @-@ year associates were invited .
oh , good . i hate that stuff .
oh , you &apos;re here . good .
problems ?
yes , he wants me to carry a parasol now .
anything new ?
yeah . this just went up .
what do you think of him ?
blake ?
i don &apos;t know . why ?
just asking .
it &apos;s the same cell phone camera .
how do you know ?
oh , same voice .
mm @-@ hmm . best evidence rule .
judge should admit the whole video . this is part of the video .
there &apos;s stuff in there that might help you blame the victims .
thanks .
oh , um , kalinda ...
look , i don &apos;t want to get in the middle of anything .
all right .
blake keeps calling you leela .
he seems to want to make some kind of point with it .
okay .
she &apos;s splitting the male vote , that &apos;s what she &apos;s doing .
she could win . she &apos;s the only female candidate .
damn right she could . we could &apos;ve buried that bitch .
you think you could say that a little louder ?
i don &apos;t think those kids heard you .
we got to scare her off .
up until the moment she announces , it &apos;s revocable .
okay . do it .
the gloves come off ?
are you saying that she leaked alicia &apos;s deposition ?
yes . the transcripts went through her office .
take the gloves off .
thank you , sir .
your honor , i don &apos;t know
what the defense counsel expects this to prove ,
but there is no evidence
that this video is part of the already submitted exhibit .
the evidence is that the same person is recording the video .
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s conclusive , counselor .
but it is persuasive , your honor .
it has the same images in common , it has the same voice .
&quot; after the fall &quot;
yeah . yes , it is .
i played maggie in high school .
no ...
my goodness , that was a tough part .
um , nancy .
that &apos;s my daughter .
yale drama .
really ?
mm @-@ hmm .
&quot; i been killed by a lot of people ,
&quot; some couldn &apos;t hardly spell , but it is the same , mister . &quot;
at my high school ,
we had to take out all the dirty words .
your honor ... could i have a ruling ?
you know , it &apos;s funny .
my daughter wanted to play maggie ,
but i think she was a much better holga .
so , is it an act ?
is what an act ?
why don &apos;t you take the next witness ?
sure .
you &apos;ve worked as a medic at the arena for how long ?
four years .
i &apos;ve been at two dozen raves ,
but i &apos;ve never seen one as crowded as that .
that was bad , wasn &apos;t it ?
it &apos;s our turn now .
no further questions , your honor .
i don &apos;t know much about this rave business .
it &apos;s like a concert , right ?
yes .
except with loud music ?
it &apos;s kind of like trance @-@ like music ?
yes .
it sounds kind of repetitive to me .
but what do i know ? i like the beatles .
objection .
sustained .
sorry . i will withdraw my musical opinions .
so i &apos;m wondering if you can help me out with something .
what is that ... there , on that woman &apos;s necklace ?
oh . it &apos;s a pacifier .
like a baby &apos;s pacifier ?
why would someone wear a pacifier to a concert ?
ecstasy tends to make people grind their teeth ,
and the pacifier is intended to stop that .
you &apos;re kidding .
i &apos;m always amazed by the things i don &apos;t know in the world .
objection .
overruled .
now , that &apos;s one of the victims there , wearing a pacifier ?
it is .
so one could conclude that that person had taken the drug ecstasy ?
yes , but ecstasy tends to calm people .
it doesn &apos;t make them stampede .
it calms them ? like this ?
i have no way to diagnose that .
now , in your first aid kit , at the arena ,
you have over 50 packs of something called--
ben ...
benzodiazepines ?
yeah ...
um , why so much of that ?
it &apos;s helpful in treating pcp .
pcp . that &apos;s another drug .
is that one also calming ?
no .
no , in fact , it &apos;s the opposite .
it makes kids violent . is that right ?
yes .
now , sometimes , these ecstasy pills are laced with pcp .
yes .
oh , my goodness .
i can see how this could happen .
no further questions .
good job .
thank you .
... also expect a delay of 30 to 40 minutes on the eisenhower expressway .
so let &apos;s sit back and enjoy
jane jensen &apos;s &quot; luv song . &quot;
* hey , here &apos;s a love song for your boyfriend *
* a love song for your new boyfriend *
* he &apos;s gotta be cool like james dean *
* and burn like fire *
* he &apos;s sweet like sugar *
* or like custard and desire *
* never backs away from a good fight *
* oh , yeah , never gets sleepy *
* he goes down all night *
* love song for your boyfriend *
* love song for your boyfriend *
what are you waiting for ?
go report it .
it &apos;s just petty harassment .
you two and alicia will say
you didn &apos;t leak childs &apos; deposition ,
what can they do , hold their breath ?
it &apos;s costing us time .
but it &apos;s not costing us clients .
they like it when we get in the face of the state &apos;s attorney .
um , are you plus one ?
am i ... ?
for the gala .
are you bringing a date ?
i &apos;m arranging the partners &apos; table .
oh , yeah . what is it again ?
the cook county bar association fund @-@ raiser gala .
right-- ccbafg .
how could i miss it ?
plus one .
good .
someone over 25 this time ?
sure , she doesn &apos;t have homework .
derrick ? how &apos; bout you ?
plus one ?
no , just myself .
oh . well , that leaves ... two seats at our table .
which one of the equity partners do you want to drag up ?
how about the florricks ?
did i say something ?
no , it &apos;s just , alicia &apos;s a second year .
i don &apos;t think we &apos;re inviting associates .
yes , but it would look good to clients
to have her husband at our table .
yeah . how about it , will ?
there &apos;s room right here , next to your plus one .
look , if i &apos;m stepping on any toes , just ...
no toes . sure , great .
the florricks . go for it .
this is funny , isn &apos;t it ?
all these connections .
my old workplace , my old boss , my old coworker ...
and my new boss competing with your husband .
and then there &apos;s you two and ...
your thing .
chicago .
shall we start ?
yeah .
so , mrs. florrick ...
did you leak the deposition you conducted with mr. childs ?
no .
good .
so we &apos;re done here .
did you tell your husband
about mr. childs &apos; deposition ?
no .
and is it fair to say
that you never leaked
confidential information to your husband ?
it is .
good , because that would be a disbarrable offense .
and is it also fair to say that you never
discuss confidential trial information with your husband ?
it is .
good .
there it is .
so , last year , september 2009 , when you first started here
at lockhart &amp; gardner , was your first case
a pro bono murder trial involving a supposed carjacking ?
yes .
and in this trial , you presented evidence that the chicago pd
pitted-- or buried-- evidence , is that right ?
yes .
where &apos;d you get this information ?
objection , cary .
what does this have to do with the leaked deposition ?
mrs. florrick has claimed that she and her husband
never discuss confidential trial information .
that wasn &apos;t a confidential trial .
perfect . then she shouldn &apos;t mind answering .
i &apos;m going to request a recess on this .
i want to review the law on this situation .
yeah , sure .
the law-- that &apos;s what you want to review .
okay . talk to me .
i ...
we have attorney @-@ client privilege , alicia .
talk to me .
peter told me there was pitted evidence .
but i pursued it myself ;
i found the pitted evidence myself .
but you only pursued it because peter pointed you there .
okay .
did you solicit this information ?
no .
then it &apos;s a passive breach .
he broke confidentiality ; you didn &apos;t .
yes , but he was only trying to help me .
i see that , but that doesn &apos;t matter .
he broke confidentiality .
will ...
this is a fishing expedition .
of course it is .
but at least you know you &apos;re not the target ; peter is .
i can &apos;t hurt him .
he was trying to help me .
alicia , listen to me .
you &apos;re a lawyer .
under oath , you have to tell the truth .
this isn &apos;t just about you .
this is about the firm , too .
okay , what ?
there &apos;s gonna be a third candidate .
who ?
first off , lay off alicia .
okay , peter , you know your mistake--
never show your opponent your weak flank .
well , we both have weak flanks ;
and the person that leaked your depo was trying to weaken us both .
your mysterious third candidate ?
presiding judge adler .
that might prove a bit difficult .
not after she retires .
now , when i was in office ,
i investigated her for judicial bribes .
so use it , peter .
why do you need me ?
well , my guess is that you have more .
thanks for answering a few more questions , mr. dylan .
i &apos;m sorry to have to ask you this ,
but did you drop ecstasy the night of the stampede ?
yes .
and your fiancee juliette , did she ?
i &apos;m sorry , but i have to ask .
no ... you don &apos;t .
you don &apos;t have to ask anything .
you &apos;re trying to blame me .
no , i &apos;m trying ...
i saw her die .
i saw ...
she was the best thing that ever happened to me ,
and i saw her crushed .
any more questions ?
thank you .
just one from me , your honor .
oh , go on .
i &apos;m sorry , paul ...
if my co @-@ counsel &apos;s efforts to protect mr. berlin
have hurt you in any way .
don &apos;t ever do that .
oh , you were turning off the jury .
you don &apos;t undercut your co @-@ counsel !
you didn &apos;t see them .
you know what this is .
you know we &apos;re going to lose ,
and you want my client to take the brunt of the award .
that &apos;s silly .
do not pick a battle with me , lady ;
not in the mood i &apos;m in .
well , let &apos;s see who wins .
you have my credit card receipt ?
i need it to , uh , return the rental car .
so ... how do i escalate this ?
any way you want , scout .
i &apos;m game .
i looked into your background , uh , kalinda .
the , uh , menlo park childhood ,
the nice suburban home ,
the immigrant parents .
it doesn &apos;t exist .
and you seem to have a past history with will gardner .
we &apos;ve both been busy .
.357 , huh ?
it &apos;s ... it &apos;s kind of a big and sloppy gun .
you @-@ you butchering deer or ... compensating for something ?
you want to find out ?
what , is that too close ?
how about this ?
or this ?
it &apos;s a little ham @-@ fisted , don &apos;t you think ?
using sex ?
i don &apos;t know .
let me feel .
yeah , you &apos;re right .
feels very ham @-@ fisted .
take care .
yeah , it was horrible .
next day , the walls were crushed , had to be re @-@ drywalled .
which doorway was it ?
the one that opened ?
over there .
but this wasn &apos;t like this , though , right ?
the stage ? no . the stage slides .
they wanted more room , so they slid it over .
that &apos;s where it happened .
weird , huh ?
five kids died right here .
what &apos;s that ?
the skids .
holds the stage in place .
this looks new .
was it recently replaced ?
yeah . it didn &apos;t have a cover that night .
this could be the reason why people tripped .
who moved the stage ?
oh , i don &apos;t know .
i didn &apos;t work that night .
i &apos;d talk to rich ,
but he doesn &apos;t work here anymore .
they did a sweep about a month ago .
sweep ?
immigration ?
yeah .
do you have his number ?
so i imagine you had a chance to review the law .
i did .
good .
so shall we just pick up right where we left off ?
it &apos;s your rodeo .
all right .
we , uh , were discussing your first case here , mrs. florrick .
a murder case .
and i asked you--
let &apos;s see-- quote :
&quot; you presented evidence that the chicago pd had pitted--
&quot; or buried-- evidence , is that right &quot; &quot;
and you said ,
&quot; yes . &quot;
and i asked , &quot; where did you get this information ? &quot;
so ... can you answer that ?
i can .
please do so now .
i got the information from the original discovery .
i found a page missing in the defense &apos;s xerox .
you do know you &apos;re under oath ?
i do .
before you discovered the missing page in the discovery ,
did anyone else tell you about the pitted evidence ?
no .
i think i &apos;ll object to that .
object to what ?
this line of questioning .
this line of questioning is on point , mr. gardner .
it goes to confirm or rebut
mrs. florrick &apos;s assertion
that she and her husband never discussed confidential trial information .
no . but nice try .
then let &apos;s call the judge .
good . let &apos;s call him .
well , he &apos;ll side with me .
he probably will .
he &apos;ll also allow me to haul mr. childs in for questioning .
mr. childs welcomes a full airing on this matter .
my guess is he won &apos;t welcome
a full airing on a matter i have first @-@ hand knowledge of ,
and intend to question him about , under oath .
and what matter is that ?
something that &apos;ll hurt him
a hell of a lot more than this &apos;ll hurt peter .
i wish when people threatened , they actually used words .
i &apos;ll guarantee you this , cary :
when you go back to your boss and report what we just discussed ,
he &apos;ll be relieved we didn &apos;t use words .
thank you .
will , i ...
i just hated how he was doing that ... that &apos;s all .
we &apos;re invited to the gala tomorrow night .
would you like me not to go ?
no . it &apos;ll be fun . go .
i need you to talk to someone for me .
who ?
victoria adler .
the presiding judge ?
i was made to understand you were friends .
well ... we were .
oh . not anymore ?
she asked me to run for a judgeship .
then she asked me not to .
we believe that she &apos;s going to use
her keynote speech tomorrow night to announce her candidacy .
for what ?
state &apos;s attorney .
so excuse the irony , but we need you to ask her not to run .
thank you , cook county bar association for this acknowledgment .
and thank you for that overwhelming introduction .
vicky .
do you have a minute ?
what &apos;s that ?
the reasons not to run .
who put you up to this ?
does it matter ?
it does to me .
you and i want a women candidate , vicky . but you &apos;re not it .
let &apos;s find someone in four years .
so this is dirt ? on me ?
you run , you &apos;ll set us back ten years .
they &apos;ll say it &apos;s because it &apos;s a woman , and not because ...
i &apos;m corrupt ?
so , how does this work ?
i promise not to run and this stuff goes away ?
probably something like that .
you &apos;re enjoying this , aren &apos;t you ?
we &apos;ve had our difficulties , but ...
i am not enjoying this .
okay ...
i promise not to run .
what &apos;s up ?
i found him .
i know that &apos;s supposed to mean something to me ...
sorry . rich salazar .
he was with the arena . maintenance .
he helped move the stage to the center of the arena ,
exposing these .
security was supposed to have covered them with plywood ,
but they thought nobody would come through that door .
and that &apos;s what tripped people ?
yeah . afterwards , client security covered them ,
before the cops got there .
security covered them ?
and he will testify to that ?
he will .
oh ...
what ?
the joint defense agreement .
i &apos;ve got to get crozier to approve
before putting him on the stand .
and she won &apos;t approve , because it &apos;ll make her client look guilty .
wait a minute-- you don &apos;t need crozier &apos;s approval ;
you need your co @-@ counsel &apos;s approval .
yeah , but ...
mr. baylon , how are you doing ?
this is kalinda sharma ; she &apos;s here to witness
your approval of my adding a new witness .
rich salazar .
he was a custodian at the arena .
do you approve , sir ?
thank you .
thank you , mr. baylon .
and have a ... a good recovery .
mr. rich salazar .
i &apos;m sorry , your honor .
i was not informed of this witness .
who is he ?
he was with arena maintenance
and will testify to certain acts by the security team .
what &apos;s going on ?
new strategy .
i &apos;m sorry , your honor ; we have a joint defense agreement .
we both need to approve of this witness .
and i didn &apos;t .
i ... i don &apos;t .
no , my joint defense agreement is with mr. baylon .
and he consented in your stead .
here &apos;s the affidavit .
this all looks in order , miss crozier .
anything else ?
no , not at the moment .
thank you , your honor .
praise the struggling worker .
the sounds of their trucks .
ahoogha . the horn .
god bless the horn .
praise the sound of the foundry .
why &apos;re you so nervous ?
i &apos;m not nervous .
want me to discuss derrek lee &apos;s free agency again ?
you know how that turns me on .
who &apos;s that ?
one of those two guys is going to be the next state &apos;s attorney .
really ? they seem like friends .
yep . politics .
i hate politics .
i love that about you .
i ... hate ... politics .
politics . hate .
praise the child digging in the sand ,
singing her song :
&quot; i am a little teapot short and stout ,
here is my handle and here is my spout . &quot;
in her words , she sings the song ...
well , we &apos;re really up front , aren &apos;t we ?
table three .
you look good .
you , too . grownup clothes .
oop , sorry . this is tamara .
ta ... tammy .
hi . alicia .
i need some wine .
did you get the verdict ?
we did .
and ?
three million dollars .
we pay two ,
the co @-@ defendant pays the rest .
two million ?
no .
two dollars .
you &apos;re kidding .
the price of the filing .
lawyers . i don &apos;t get lawyers .
they seem to always want to trick people .
tamara &apos;s a reporter .
the sporting news .
we sit and wait for a bus .
hush @-@ hush . here it comes .
here it comes .
thank you , nana .
and welcome . what a year it &apos;s been .
there you are .
i was wondering what happened to you .
late verdict .
good verdict ?
yes .
let &apos;s celebrate .
... women &apos;s causes for decades .
she is without a doubt my mentor .
victoria .
you &apos;re happy .
yep .
kept a third candidate out of the race .
thank you , cook county bar association for this acknowledgement ,
and thank you , diane , for that overwhelming introduction .
i know you share this sentiment :
that women have far too long found themselves
the afterthought in chicago jurisprudence .
always we hear the same thing : four more years ,
four more years .
but it is not the four more years of re @-@ election ;
it is the four more years of &quot; just wait ... &quot;
oh , no ...
&quot; then it will be your turn . &quot;
and so , tonight , i am pleased to announce
a new candidate in the race for state &apos;s attorney .
i mean no disrespect to the two other current candidates--
both here and both capable--
but every now and then , you need a woman to clean house .
and that woman is ... wendy scott @-@ carr .
time to clean house .
she was in the deposition . she leaked it .
thank you so much .
my mother and my grandmother were housecleaners ,
so i guess i can continue the tradition .
