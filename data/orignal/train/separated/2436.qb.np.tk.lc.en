the spell the travelers cast across mystic falls
eliminates spirit magic ,
the other side is collapsing ,
and everyone in it is going away .
what about you ? what happens ?
jeremy , i will be fine .
when the travelers die ,
liv will do the spell ,
and her magic will allow
the people on the other side to push their way through .
damon ...
i know
oh , my god . alaric , what are you--
come on . you got to go .
what about damon ?
you need to go home to your brother .
i &apos;ll find damon .
i can &apos;t find damon .
i &apos;m not leaving without him !
i won &apos;t let you die for them .
phasmatos fumas extas .
we need to start the spell again .
we can &apos;t . that was our one shot .
damon &apos;s on the other side .
elena , you can say good @-@ bye .
damon , finally had everything he wanted .
he was happy .
he should be here .
it was all a lie .
you told me you could come back .
i love you .
bonnie , bonnie , don &apos;t you dare .
please don &apos;t leave me .
i love you , elena .
bye .
bonnie ...
bonnie ...
do you think it will hurt ?
i don &apos;t know .
what the hell was that ?
i have no idea .
go out there and check it out .
you go out there and check it out .
hey , i got the lan--
oh , my god . sheriff forbes .
i thought you were a serial killer .
worse , actually ,
because you &apos;ll still be alive when i call your parents .
pack it up and strike it down .
i &apos;m like , for real , sheriff forbes ?
you got nothing better to do
than to bust us for a couple of beer cans ?
tax money at work .
it could &apos;ve been worse .
melanie peterson was arrested for underage drinking last week .
i swear this place is turning into that town from &quot; footloose . &quot;
yeah , well , let &apos;s just get out of here .
jessie ?
yo , jessie .
jessie .
jessie .
don &apos;t talk .
you &apos;ll be ok . i &apos;ll get help .
look . up .
today was a good day .
summer is official over
and i couldn &apos;t be more thrilled .
sophomore year .
i guess this is the year you &apos;re supposed to pick a major
and start carving out your path in life .
so , that &apos;s what i did .
you are look at the future dr. elena gilbert .
so . pop quiz .
mr. weatherly complains of chest pain and shortness of breath .
can anyone tell me what tests we run ?
gilbert .
a pulmonary angiogram provides a clear picture
of the blood flow in the arteries and the lungs ,
which is what we look for in a pulmonary embolism ,
a condition in which mr. weatherly &apos;s symptoms are common .
good someone &apos;s read ahead .
remember that . you &apos;ll need that in 3 years .
here &apos;s the bed pan you need to know about today .
moving on .
i was impressed .
thanks .
ok , so , maybe i spent the day observing .
but at least now we have unlimited access to blood bank ,
and trust me , we need all the help we can get .
some of us are still getting the hang of the whole
drinking other people &apos;s blood thing .
want some ?
it &apos;s all right . i had some on the way over .
you know , this will never not be weird .
what ? that some ancient witch turned me into a vampire
or that 4 months ago , i rose from the dead ?
that you &apos;re my college professor .
in alaric &apos;s defense ,
he couldn &apos;t exactly compel himself a job back at the high school .
nope , the high school , grill , the town square--
thanks to the travelers &apos; anti @-@ magic spell ,
everything in mystic falls still off @-@ limits to anyone with fangs .
a lot of us haven &apos;t been back home in months .
on the plus side , the crime rate is way down .
although i &apos;m not sure matt got the memo .
good move , donovan . proving once again
that self @-@ defense is the best offense .
i will say he &apos;s never been better .
i think he can bench press more than jeremy now ,
which is beyond freaky .
speaking of jeremy ...
actually , let &apos;s not talk about my brother .
let &apos;s talk about stefan .
last i heard , he was chasing some lead to some
witch that could contact the dead .
get your ass in here , kid .
payday .
we haven &apos;t spoken in months .
which can only mean that his search
for answers to what happened has been all @-@ consuming .
he &apos;s grieving . he lost so much .
we all did .
but we &apos;re all getting through it in our own way .
i dropped out of whitmore .
why would i support their stupid football team ?
it &apos;s the opening game of the season , caroline .
time to come home .
i am home . i just signed the lease to my new apartment .
on the border of a town that doesn &apos;t want you .
that &apos;s not home . that &apos;s sad .
you don &apos;t even like football .
no , but i like drinking in the parking lot beforehand .
caroline , you &apos;re coming .
tyler , don &apos;t act like you have any ground to stand on .
you skipped an entire year .
and you hounded me for an entire year .
so , here i am . now , get your ass back here .
caroline , i &apos;m picking you up at your house at 6 p.m. sharp tomorrow .
ok ? bring your school spirit . bye .
anyway ...
as i was saying .
i haven &apos;t exactly found a spell
that can undo an anti @-@ magic border per se ,
but this book mentions travelers ,
which isn &apos;t that helpful ,
but at least it &apos;s a step in the right direction .
sweetheart .
yeah ?
you should go with them tomorrow .
no . we &apos;re gonna go see a movie .
we have spent the entire summer together .
god . you &apos;re sick of me .
caroline , you just lost one of your best friends .
it makes sense that you want to hold on to what &apos;s familiar ,
but elena lost her , too ,
and she clearly misses you .
no . elena clearly has taken up residency on planet denial ,
where football is more important than her boyfriend
being swept away into oblivion .
do you know she &apos;s barely cried for him ?
she was a full @-@ on wreck over bonnie for months ,
but every time i mention damon , it &apos;s like nothing ever happened .
caroline , elena has experienced more grief
than anyone i &apos;ve ever met .
you should cut her some slack .
what ? someone trample over mr. davis &apos;s flower bed again ?
two kids were admitted to the hospital
with suspicious wounds on their necks .
vampire attacks ? how ?
vampires can &apos;t get into mystic falls .
no , but they can lurk around the borders .
i gotta cut lunch short .
that &apos;s it . i gotta take care of this . listen .
consider elena &apos;s offer , ok ?
mystic falls isn &apos;t going anywhere .
hey , don &apos;t forget your basket .
she doesn &apos;t want to let go .
i get it .
i don &apos;t want to let go , either .
i don &apos;t want to think that everything &apos;s changed ,
that i have to start over .
the worst thing that could possibly happen actually did .
but i don &apos;t have to .
anyway , that was my day . how was yours ?
can we go back to the part
where ric came back to life to be a college professor ?
&quot; occult . &quot;
the word in its literal translation means &quot; hidden . &quot;
therefore , the study of the occult--
therefore , the study of the occult
is the study of hidden knowledge .
today , we &apos;re going to discuss it as it relates to resurrection .
is there something funny , liv ?
more like ironic , but ok .
oh , mr. lockwood .
how generous of the practice squad to lend you to us .
sorry i &apos;m late .
typically , not all occult groups held a consensus on the topic .
sorry , princess .
just trying to check what page we &apos;re on .
i &apos;m trying to listen .
... apostles , the athanasian creeds tertullian ,
and the western church were inclined to believe
in resurrection of the flesh ,
whereas the gnostics held the firm belief
that resurrection existed only in a spiritual sense .
elena , you know i can smell that , right ?
i &apos;m teaching a class full of kids
who all look like blood sausages to me .
now , put that away .
sorry .
uh , whereas others , like the early church fathers .
luke .
hey , i gotta run , actually .
oh , no , i &apos;ll be quick . really quick .
i just--i &apos;ve been really thirsty lately .
do you think it &apos;s because of the ... you know .
are you asking me if there are side effects
to the ancient psychotropic herbs i &apos;ve been giving you ,
becausere there haven &apos;t exactly been clinical trials .
obviously .
i don &apos;t--i was just wondering if maybe you could , like , i don &apos;t know-
add something to the next batch ?
yeah , or maybe there shouldn &apos;t be a next batch .
what do you mean ?
luke , it was your idea that i see him again , remember ?
you were all , &quot; hey , elena , i &apos;m sorry that i wronged you .
i &apos;m sorry that i &apos;m the reason your boyfriend is dead , &quot; remember ?
and i am . i &apos;m sorry .
something i made clear when i made alaric &apos;s daytime bracelet ,
because you asked .
yeah , i know .
and when i went against
my coven rules to get these herbs ,
because you asked .
right .
but it &apos;s time to return to reality here .
look , i &apos;m fine .
i &apos;m ok . i promise .
just come by my place by 5 , ok ?
elena .
thank you .
hey , dean .
i think a zero might &apos;ve fallen off my paycheck .
oh , yeah . i had to dock you 200 bucks .
for what ?
dan zimmer said you put a ding on the hood of his shelby .
dan &apos;s wife put a ding on the hood of his shelby .
that &apos;s funny .
sounds like you &apos;re calling my best customer a liar .
you &apos;re ripping me off , dean .
what you gonna do about it , kid ?
you gonna quit ?
run off to wherever the hell you came from ?
that &apos;s what i thought .
hello ?
hey , just checkiing in
to see if your contact panned out yet .
still working on it .
good . keep me posted . let me know how it goes .
you already read all that ?
cover to cover , with no mention
on how to undo an anti @-@ magic force @-@ field .
and if i &apos;m going to single @-@ handedly take back our town ,
i &apos;m gonna need a little bit more to go on .
got it . all right , well ,
i brought &quot; ancient witchcraft , volume two . &quot;
i read it .
how about &quot; the art of hexing &quot; and &quot; elements of magic &quot; ?
fine . thank you .
so , how &apos;s stefan ?
he &apos;s ok .
how often do you talk to him ?
i don &apos;t know . couple times a week .
i &apos;m gonna go out on a limb here , caroline .
is something bothering you ?
he didn &apos;t say good @-@ bye .
damon and bonnie died and he just left .
no phone calls , no e @-@ mails ,
just disappeared into thin air .
and i haven &apos;t heard from him in months .
i actually convinced myself
that he was in some remote mountain region
and couldn &apos;t accept my calls .
or maybe he just doesn &apos;t want to bother you
with every half @-@ lead that goes nowhere .
or maybe i just need to get over it .
thanks for the books .
why isn &apos;t jeremy answering his phone ?
i don &apos;t know . he &apos;s probably doing homework or something .
doing homework ?
put me on speaker , please .
jeremy , i know you can hear me .
get your butt off that couch and do something productive .
or what ? you &apos;re gonna come here and make me ?
or i &apos;ll have the sheriff arrest you
and drag you to the town border ,
where i will kick your ass myself .
matt , a little help , please .
yeah , i &apos;ll deal with him .
thank you .
so . this is it , huh ?
video games . random girls .
drunk by noon every day .
look , it sucks that bonnie &apos;s dead , jer .
i get it . but you need to start living your life again .
how ? by joining the community protection squad ?
what exactly are you protecting us from ?
bike theft ? litter ?
magic doesn &apos;t work here . the town &apos;s safe .
for now . but caroline &apos;s working on a way to reverse all that .
so , it &apos;s only a matter of time before we &apos;re dealing with
all the problems that come along with vampires again .
you &apos;re a hunter . you have skills .
use them .
no more magic means i &apos;m not a hunter anymore .
yeah , you &apos;re right , jer .
you &apos;re not much of anything anymore .
hey . you &apos;re home .
i thought you were coming over at 5 .
i know you did . look , elena ,
i can &apos;t help you anymore .
is it because i told you that i was thirsty ?
it &apos;s fine . i can get more at the blood bank at the clinic .
i work there . it &apos;s easy .
elena , you &apos;re going through this stuff like crazy .
yeah .
i &apos;m not a drug pusher .
no , you &apos;re my friend .
my friend
in spite of the fact that my boyfriend got stuck on the other side .
elena , don &apos;t .
because you decided to stop the spell that could bring him back .
my friend that owes me .
no . a friend who cares about you
and thinks you &apos;re living in denial .
i know you have more .
elena , stop .
where is it ?
look at you .
where is it ?
i need to see damon , luke ,
and i &apos;m not asking .
i kind of want to set up ric with jo from the hospital .
i mean , we both know he has a soft spot for the sexy doctor type .
how long do you think it takes after
somebody comes back to life before they can start dating again ?
well , the fact that you can say that with a straight face
is one more reason that i love you .
so , like , 3 months ?
can i ask why there &apos;s not a bennett witch in the back ?
i mean , can &apos;t luke whip up a batch of herbs in bonnie flavor ?
you know , if i had to drive around with everyone that i &apos;ve lost ,
i &apos;d need a school bus .
or you just know that bonnie would agree with luke .
the last thing you need to do
is conjure up someone who &apos;s gonna tell you the truth .
can we not talk about this ?
about what ? the fact that i &apos;m dead ?
cos i am .
technically , you were dead when we met .
good point . now i &apos;m just gone .
damon , please don &apos;t say that .
and this conversation is pretty much the smart , level @-@ headed you
talking to the irrational possible drug addict you .
which is clear evidence of your insanity .
yeah . ok .
oh ! watch it , dick .
sorry .
still working out the kinks of being human .
my tolerance blows .
yeah , tyler , not to play chaperone here ,
but are you sure somebody with your anger issues
should be drinking at all this close to a full moon ?
my issues are under control .
coach lets me practice with the football team .
i get to kick ass in a controlled environment .
till you get plastered and do something stupid
and trigger your werewolf curse all over again .
alaric , chill . it &apos;s under control .
good . but just in case .
really ?
you know , i haven &apos;t been buzzed since i came back to life .
and saying that aloud while sober really freaks me out .
as the only sober person here , trust me
when i tell you this , tyler-- that girl is so not into you .
thanks for the beer .
your fridge makes me want to kill myself .
we &apos;re gonna have to split this .
knock yourself out .
so . you want to grab dinner ?
there &apos;s that crab shack on the harbor you want to check out .
uh , yeah , i would ,
but , um , i told dean i &apos;d stop by the garage later .
yeah , never heard that one before .
hey , look , no offense , ivy , but , uh ,
you &apos;re the one who showed up to me today .
hey , i &apos;m not asking for your hand in marriage .
stefan , come on .
we &apos;ve been hanging out for two months now .
i don &apos;t know anything about you or your family .
your friends you never talk about call you
and you get all weird .
i get weird ?
yeah . you get weird .
so , we &apos;ll play a game .
you tell me one thing about you
and i &apos;ll tell you one thing about me .
well , i already know everything about you .
you &apos;re from colorado . you love dogs .
your dad &apos;s a bit of a pain in the ass ,
but you graciously let him pay your rent .
ok . fine . your turn .
now tell me something i don &apos;t know about you .
i &apos;m a vampire .
you &apos;re so annoying .
and i like you .
thank god . someone over 20 .
the rest of the chaperones are huddled around the burger bar .
and you &apos;re a vegetarian .
i don &apos;t eat red meat . i look at blood all day .
because i work at the medical center .
not because i &apos;m a serial killer or anything .
right .
i &apos;m jo .
alaric . i teach occult studies here .
i didn &apos;t know that was an actual thing .
yeah .
not that it &apos;s not a thing .
may i ?
uh , you know , actually , i &apos;m a germaphobe .
a germaphobe .
yeah .
so , you &apos;re like a vegetarian of cool people .
yeah . exactly .
um ... will you excuse me a second ?
i actually have to make a--
a quick phone call .
ok , so , when i lost my human nature ,
i also lost my game .
where are you ?
what are you looking for ?
i thought i had-- guess not .
what &apos;s this ?
are you ok ?
depends . am i still in the western hemisphere ?
hang on . i can help .
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m from new york
and we &apos;re big on cell phone reception .
where you heading ?
mystic falls .
my gps died and then i started second @-@ guessing myself--aah !
easy . this is when you wipe her slate and let her go .
i am still hungry .
you &apos;re gonna kill her ,
just like you nearly killed the last one
and the one before that and the one before that .
i got it , damon . i &apos;m gonna let her go .
i &apos;m just--i just need a little more .
oh , my god !
what are you--
caroline . it &apos;s not--
no !
help . help , anybody .
what did you do ?
why the hell are you feeding on people ?
it &apos;s fine . i &apos;ve compelled everyone else .
whoa , hang on . so , you &apos;re the border lurker ?
the what ?
did you know my mom &apos;s been out looking for a vampire prowler ?
it &apos;s gotta be the herbs luke &apos;s been giving me .
they make me so thirsty .
maybe i &apos;m not thinking straight .
whoa . what herbs ?
they make me see damon .
i can talk to him and--and-- and i can be with him and--
is this what you &apos;ve been doing this whole time ?
hallucinating your dead boyfriend ?
i tried to grieve him , caroline .
trust me . i know grief .
i &apos;ve got grieving down to a science at this point ,
and i tried .
but every time ...
i let it sink in that
i &apos;m never gonna see him again ...
i feel like i &apos;m gonna die .
look , hon , i get it . ok ? i do .
but ... there are better ways to get through this .
like what ?
like dropping out of school and
having picnics with my mom near the town border ?
or maybe i could pull a stefan
and just bounce from country to country chasing some false hope
that we &apos;re gonna find a way to bring damon and bonnie back .
we &apos;re all getting through it .
this is me getting through it . ok ?
yeah , but you &apos;re not getting through it , elena .
you &apos;re just pressing pause .
look . i &apos;ll call my mom and she can fix all this .
but you need to get out of here
and go hide , ok ?
so , just ... go .
what am i doing ?
help me .
please help me .
you &apos;re ok .
it &apos;s ok .
you have to help me .
there was this girl . i saw her .
she looked so normal but i swear to god ,
she had these teeth and she bit me .
you have to help me ... - what the hell is going on here ?
you need to find her .
what happened ?
there was this girl and i was--i was lost--
she hit a dog .
it bit her . she was lost .
she stopped to ask this girl for directions .
she had a dog and it bit her .
is that what happened ?
look at me .
matt . what &apos;s going on here ?
this girl was attacked .
i &apos;m not sure we &apos;re getting the full story .
matt , get her to the hospital now .
no ... you &apos;re not listening .
what are you doing ? you need to talk to her .
we &apos;ll get a statement as soon as she &apos;s been treated .
you didn &apos;t even ask her what happened .
all due respect , tripp ,
you run a volunteer community program .
i &apos;m the sheriff . let me do my job .
go !
两通未接电话
hello ?
stefan , is that you ?
i know it &apos;s been a really long time since we talked , but--
elena , hey .
what &apos;s going on ?
i need you to tell me that you found something .
a witch . a guy who knows a witch
who knows something . anything .
i need you to give me hope and tell me
that you &apos;re gonna find damon and bring him back .
not yet .
but how do you do it ?
how do you wake up in the morning ?
how do you go about your day without falling apart ?
tell me what you &apos;re doing to get through this ,
because i &apos;m clearly doing it wrong .
there &apos;s no right or wrong way , elena .
no , there &apos;s only forever .
that &apos;s why i need you to give me hope .
because i don &apos;t think i can live forever without him .
i can &apos;t . i gave up .
you just said that you were looking for him .
i did .
and then i realized it was pointless
and that i needed to move on with my life ,
so ... i stopped .
what do you mean you stopped ?
i mean i said good @-@ bye , elena .
i moved on . damon is gone .
it &apos;s time for you to say good @-@ bye , too .
no .
where are you ?
the game &apos;s gonna start in , like , 15 minutes .
do you know elena has some witchy drug problem ?
yeah , luke parker has been feeding her some concoction
that allows her to hallucinate damon .
whoa . slow down . what ?
it gets her all bloodlusty and confused .
she nearly killed a girl today .
this makes no sense .
yeah , well , neither did the fact that
she got over damon so quickly when he died .
now it &apos;s crystal clear . she hasn &apos;t .
she &apos;s living in a fantasy land .
is she ok ?
she &apos;s a mess . and as long as luke keeps playing witch doctor ,
she &apos;s not going to get any better .
let me deal with him .
we &apos;re just meeting up with my friend here .
神秘瀑布镇
everything will be fine .
sarah , stop , please .
get back in the car . stop ! sarah !
hey ! i &apos;m not gonna hurt you .
you kidnapped me .
look , i know you &apos;re scared ,
and i &apos;m sorry that this happened to you ,
but all i can do is promise that it won &apos;t happen again .
why the hell should i trust you ?
because i &apos;ve been attacked like that more times than i can count .
i &apos;ve had my throat ripped open .
i &apos;ve had my neck snapped , my hand smashed .
i &apos;ve drowned . i &apos;ve died and come back to life .
and i &apos;ve lost what little family i had ,
and i refuse to lose anyone else .
i want to protect people like you .
like us .
that &apos;s ... quite a story , but ...
thing is , i don &apos;t trust anyone . ever .
that &apos;s probably wise .
hey . have you seen elena ?
she &apos;s not coming .
apparently , she &apos;s not in her right mind .
what happened ?
is this what you &apos;ve been up to all summer ?
messing with elena &apos;s brain ?
does it help with the guilt
or are you just desperate for friends ?
where &apos;s elena now ?
why ? so you can trick her into thinking damon &apos;s alive ?
who does that ? she almost killed someone .
you &apos;re drunk .
don &apos;t touch me .
where &apos;s your magic now , parker ?
what &apos;s wrong ? you can &apos;t chant ?
you stay away from elena ,
or you &apos;re gonna have a problem your magic wand can &apos;t fix .
hey ! knock it off .
knock it off .
you got it under control , huh ?
you want to tell me what that was about ?
come on . let &apos;s get out of here .
you can &apos;t be here .
you &apos;re not even real .
it &apos;s just my subconscious making me see what i want to see .
one call from my brother and you &apos;re gonna throw all this away ?
you know i want to see you , damon .
but it makes me reckless . i hurt people .
so , why am i here ?
do you want to move on ?
move on .
i never got to say thank you .
for what ?
for saving stefan
and ... for bringing back alaric and tyler .
thank you .
elena --
no , i &apos;m not done yet . i --
i want to thank you for giving me everything i always wanted .
a love that consumed me . and passion .
adventure .
there &apos;s nothing more i could ever want
other than for it to last forever , but ...
it can &apos;t .
this is the last time i &apos;m gonna see you .
this is good @-@ bye , damon .
i love you .
i have to let go .
you &apos;re still holding on .
i -- no , i ...
i said good @-@ bye , damon .
i don &apos;t blame you .
you know what &apos;s waiting for you .
how long before you go running back to luke ?
no . i told you . that was the last time , damon .
i @-@ i &apos;m done .
an eternity of torment , agony , and grief , and you feel it all .
stop it , damon . stop it , stop it .
you &apos;re getting in my head .
don &apos;t do this . please .
you &apos;ll feel it forever .
no !
could you be more of a douchebag cliche ?
i got a little out of control . i know .
a little ? it &apos;s not luke &apos;s fault that your friend &apos;s
emotionally blackmailing him to fulfill whatever mental head case crap
she &apos;s going through .
grief . it &apos;s called grief .
your brother got to live that day , remember ?
the rest of us lost people because of him .
i &apos;m aware of that , tyler .
i think about it every day .
so does luke .
a lot of you got your lives back , too ,
because of me .
so , at the very least , do me a favor
and lay off my brother .
you &apos;re right . i &apos;m sorry .
yeah . our twin powers don &apos;t work like that .
you actually have to tell luke to his face .
well , i will . listen .
liv , 4 months ago , i could do anything .
i could make anyone do anything that i wanted .
i was stronger than most people on this earth .
and then it went away .
and all that &apos;s left inside of me is rage .
why are you telling me this ?
because i want you to understand that i am trying to deal with it .
ok , good . good luck dealing with it .
why do you do that ?
i &apos;m trying to talk to you
and you just give me that look and walk away ?
what would you like me to do , tyler ?
it &apos;s stefan . leave a message .
hey . it &apos;s me .
just leaving another message about
how today was not a good day .
everyone drifted apart .
it &apos;s like
everyone &apos;s pretending they can get through this alone .
elena &apos;s gone .
and i think she &apos;s so scared to accept what happened
that she &apos;s become a completely different person .
and if you ask me , tyler &apos;s just hiding at whitmore ,
pretending everything &apos;s fine
as if he can outrun his werewolf gene or something .
matt and jeremy never leave mystic falls anymore .
there &apos;s an invisible wall standing between us and them
and nobody &apos;s doing anything about it .
part of me wonders if they hope we never find a way back in .
and then there &apos;s me ,
just sitting in a diner on the border of town
looking for a way to get our home back .
we just lost two of our closest friends .
we need each other . we need to be together , stefan ,
or pretty soon we &apos;re just gonna end up
pictures in a yearbook in a drawer somewhere ,
and so , that is why i am not going to stop calling you
until you pick up the phone and i hear your voice
and you tell me that you are going to help me fix it .
because i &apos;m not going to give up on us .

do you like being a vampire ?
why don &apos;t you get some sleep ?
we &apos;ll talk about it tomorrow
when that crap &apos;s out of your system .
because with all the funerals
and the start of the year ...
we never really talked about how you &apos;re dealing with all this .
you mean with me coming back to life ?
well , moving away from mystic falls helped .
and since my ex @-@ girlfriend is
happily married to a pediatrician up in alaska ,
i didn &apos;t have any awkward reunions to handle .
i meant the blood lust .
the heightened emotions and immortality .
honestly , elena ...
i hate everything about being a vampire .
me , too .
at least i did .
then one day , i discovered the good part .
you know ... the promise that love could be eternal .
and i had that with damon .
which means for the rest of eternity ,
i &apos;m gonna have a hole in my heart where
he &apos;s supposed to be .
trust me . it gets easier .
i know how death works , ric .
trust me . i have done it . a lot .
there &apos;s no such thing as moving on .
it &apos;s a lie .
so , if i &apos;m ever going to be able to fall in love again ,
and make eternity bearable ,
i need you to do something .
what ?
you were created by the original vampire spell ,
which means you can compel other vampires .
and since i can &apos;t take away my vampirism ,
i want you to take away damon .
i want you to compel me to forget that
i ever loved him .
every day i tell you i hate that .
and every day i do it .
