the 2011 tesla roadster sport ,
offered only to our most exclusive members .
you know your vehicles .
i promise to have her back before she turns into a pontiac .
hey , harvey .
laurence .
how would you feel about taking something other than the tesla tonight ?
it goes against my policy .
what policy ?
my &quot; i want the tesla &quot; policy .
yeah .
tell you what .
you know more about the car than i do ,
it &apos;s yours .
horsepower .
really ? that &apos;s where we &apos;re starting ?
well , if it &apos;s so simple , just answer it .
288 .
top speed .
125 miles an hour .
0 to 60--
3.7 seconds .
yeah . you know your cars .
i &apos;m an enthusiast .
and i &apos;ve been waiting for the tesla for months .
okay .
laurence .
knock yourself out .
so why &apos;d you let him have it ?
because it never hurts to have a man
who runs a $ 2 billion hedge fund owe you one .
but if you &apos;re just gonna give it to him ,
why bother to compete first ?
because if i didn &apos;t beat him ,
he wouldn &apos;t feel he owed me one .
i &apos;m suddenly feeling old school .
why don &apos;t you surprise me , huh ?
are you mike ross ?
harvey told me to tell you that 8 : 00 means 8 : 00 .
glad you showed up .
oh , hey . i &apos;m sorry . i was just--
shut up .
ok .
you see these cars ?
yeah . they &apos;re awesome .
they suck .
they &apos;re nothing compared to this .
the engine in this car is made by mckernon motors ,
the industry standard in formula one .
in fact , they &apos;ve won more championships
than any other engine on the planet .
how do you know all this ?
avery mckernon was the first client
i ever brought into the firm .
was ?
he died three months ago .
oh , god . i &apos;m so sorry--
not the point .
mckernon &apos;s engines and his company
have something in common--
they win , like me .
and because i win , i &apos;ve been promoted to senior partner ,
which means you &apos;ll be handling all their paperwork .
oh , so you brought me here
to give me an appreciation for the product .
no , i brought you here to meet robert stensland ,
the new ceo .
he &apos;ll want to put your name with a face .
how do you know ?
because robert &apos;s a tightwad ,
and we don &apos;t bill you out for nothing .
wait a minute . is this conversation right now billable ?
you bet your ass it is .
yes . up top . come on .
what ? we &apos;re making all this money . we can &apos;t celebrate it ?
not in poor taste .
dominic . mike , i &apos;d like you to meet dominic barone ,
the man responsible for the design and production of this engine .
this is my new associate , mike ross .
he &apos;s just a kid .
are you trying to steal his soul before he hits puberty ?
okay , obviously ...
you &apos;re still upset about our labor negotiations .
my-- my workers took a big hit .
and mckernon took a bigger one .
both of which poised the company to be strong for years .
i was always straight with you about that .
sophisticated words for a guy who screwed us .
look , i &apos;m sorry you feel that way ,
but you have to admit ,
i did have the courtesy to do it from the front .
wow . yeah , he really appreciates
what you &apos;ve done for the company .
robert stensland ,
i &apos;d like you to meet your new associate , mike ross .
we &apos;re not paying him what we pay you .
nor should you , but i assure you he &apos;s highly effective .
well , i &apos;ll believe it when i see it .
i had him read your corporate lease last week .
ask him anything .
that &apos;s a 300 @-@ page document .
okay , what are the terms ?
okay , i have no idea what you &apos;re talking about .
the named lessee was the parent company , glendon enterprises .
35,000 square feet
at 19 west 57th .
$ 80 a foot .
expires in six months with an option to extend .
exercisable in 30 days .
who signed the lease ?
you did .
what &apos;s my middle name ?
the letter &quot; l. &quot;
what happens in the event the company no longer exists ?
that wasn &apos;t in the lease .
how can you be sure ?
because the lease i read wasn &apos;t 300 pages .
it was 364 .
and i can tell you what &apos;s on any one of those pages ,
but i can &apos;t tell you that .
that &apos;s how i can be sure .
excellent .
you can get him started on the new deal right away .
new deal ?
yeah .
i have found a buyer willing to spend $ 200 million
for the ground underneath the flagship factory .
where are you moving manufacturing ?
well , that &apos;s the beauty of it .
the real asset of mckernon motors is the name .
we move overseas , we save ourselves a bundle .
up front payout while retaining the name
and maintaining cash flow over time .
that &apos;s genius .
exactly .
all right , we &apos;ll take care of everything .
okay .
thanks .
really ?
jesus . i knew he was cheap .
i didn &apos;t realize he was an idiot .
what are you talking about ?
the asset &apos;s not the name . it &apos;s the quality .
he moves overseas ,
it &apos;s gonna kill the goose that laid the goddamn golden engine .
wait a minute .
i thought you didn &apos;t get emotionally attached to the client .
i &apos;m emotionally attached to me .
look , i made a bet that this company would grow
and my billables would grow with it .
we &apos;re holding a pair of aces ,
and this asshole &apos;s trying to fold .
so ? what are you gonna do ?
i &apos;m not gonna do anything .
you &apos;re gonna go through those bylaws ,
and you &apos;re gonna find me a way to get rid of robert stensland .
no , no , no , no . i have to go see my grandmother .
is she dying ?
no .
cancel on her .
yeah .
did you find anything that &apos;ll help me get rid of stensland ?
uh , yeah , i think so .
well , if you &apos;re not here when i need it ,
what good does that do me ?
what ? it &apos;s 7 : 15 ...
did you get it ?
picked it up yesterday .
did you sleep with it under your pillow ?
how i sleep is none of your concern .
yeah , neither is the yankees &apos; batting order ,
but that doesn &apos;t stop me from thinking about it .
harvey . promise me you won &apos;t be cocky .
i understand what &apos;s at stake here .
i &apos;ll be perfectly humble .
great . you ready ?
you kidding ? i was born for this .
7 : 45 . nice of you to show up .
uh , yeah , i was up till 5 : 00 in the morning .
i &apos;m kidding . but louis litt wants to see you ,
and i don &apos;t kid about that .
what does he want ?
i don &apos;t know .
louis doesn &apos;t let me in on his game plan ,
but i kind of prefer it that way .
okay , um , can you tell him that i have to see harvey first ?
your call .
but , uh , if you &apos;re gonna be sleeping in your suits ,
you may want to keep a fresh one in the office .
is it that bad ?
it &apos;s worse .
come on .
i &apos;d just like to say this is an honor ,
i take it seriously ,
and i intend to make you all proud .
except you , fred .
i gave up on making you proud in &apos; 99 .
okay . there is one more order of business .
he &apos;s not here .
no .
where is he ?
he &apos;s at his senior partner initiation .
but let me ask you something .
what &apos;s the difference between a senior partner
and ... other partners ?
isn &apos;t that something you should have been studying
when you were pretending to go to harvard ?
okay . senior partners , they buy into the firm .
they share in the profits ,
but they also have to put up equity .
so how much does it cost to buy in ?
$ 1 / 2 million ... right now ?
harvey , you knew what the buy @-@ in was .
you knew today was initiation .
how could you not have the money ?
i didn &apos;t think it was due today .
it &apos;s not due today , is it ?
no . it &apos;s not .
every man in this room fell for exactly the same thing .
does that include you ?
no . no , it doesn &apos;t .
thank you , gentlemen .
peanuts , gluten , strawberries .
what is this ? a shopping list ?
no , it &apos;s just a list of foods that i &apos;m allergic to ,
so when you select the venue ,
these foods are not to be on the menu .
a venue for what ?
no one told you ?
no one told me .
oh , drats .
well , a long @-@ standing pearson hardman tradition
is the rookie dinner ,
which means you , the ...
rookie .
that &apos;s right .
are to host a dinner for your fellow associates .
well , come on . don &apos;t look so blue .
oh , it &apos;s okay . it &apos;s really easy .
all you have to do is just find a unique location
and then coordinate with 50 other associates .
it &apos;s really simple . no pressure .
and you &apos;re allergic to chicken ?
no , i just don &apos;t like it .
oh , by the way , what was so important
that you had to see harvey before you came to see me ?
louis , harvey doesn &apos;t really--
can we-- can we-- can we-- can we just-- shut up .
okay .
let me just get something straight , okay ?
when i ask you a question ,
i just expect an answer .
mckernon motors .
i was working on the due diligence .
and why would that require you to look at the bylaws ?
state law requires a summary be prepared in the event of a sale .
privately held corporations are exempted .
not if the sale exceeds 150 million .
according to who ?
the state &apos;s website .
i like to be thorough .
well , put it there , buddy .
are you fricking serious ?
i understand stensland is throwing a large amount
of legal work our way with the mckernon motors factory sale .
how &apos;d you know that ?
i hear things .
you taking care of him ?
i am .
by the way , for when it is due .
what &apos;s this ?
it &apos;s a cashier &apos;s check for $ 500,000 .
you had this the whole time .
i &apos;ve had the money since i set my sights
on senior partner .
nice of you to finally make it .
why does everybody keep saying that ?
because you &apos;re supposed to be here
when you &apos;re supposed to be here .
doesn &apos;t seem to apply to you .
i &apos;m not the topic of this conversation .
now what &apos;d you find me on mckernon motors ?
the board can &apos;t vote for at least 24 hours after the ceo
presents a deal involving the sale of company land .
but stensland already presented it to the board .
right , but stensland isn &apos;t ceo .
i wrote those bylaws myself . he &apos;s ceo .
hmm . page 238 , clause 137
states if the ceo dies ,
an interim ceo will be appointed
until the board convenes an election vote ,
which can &apos;t be called till the next fiscal quarter ,
in this case next thursday .
so they can &apos;t vote him in until thursday ?
thursday .
okay .
well , prepare the due diligence
for me to take to stensland ,
but i don &apos;t want anything ready to sign .
where are you going ?
out .
i have until thursday to find a new ceo .
huh .
what ?
oh , nothing . uh , you know , just six hours ,
1,500 pages , and i , uh ,
i found your mistake .
yeah , you found the one mistake i made
while drafting those bylaws a dozen years ago
when i was two years younger than you .
a mistake , by the way ,
that &apos;s gonna help me get rid of stensland .
mistake .
excuse me , mr. specter ?
i was wondering if you might need a hand sometime
with one of your matters .
uh , any one .
well , allen--
it &apos;s aaron .
i think that says it all , don &apos;t you ?
what are you doing ?
uh , i &apos;m looking for a restaurant .
where did you go for your rookie dinner ?
i came into the league a sophomore .
you better not be prioritizing that
over mckernon motors .
i still need something to stall stensland .
it &apos;s right here .
what are you so irritated about ?
i spent a day with a top headhunter i know
who couldn &apos;t produce one legitimate ceo candidate by thursday .
what about that dominic barone guy
who runs production ?
you said he was responsible for the engines ,
and he clearly cares about the workers .
no , he &apos;s not the guy .
oh , you &apos;re scared you can &apos;t convince him
because he hates you . i get it .
nice try .
you know you can &apos;t host your dinner there .
that &apos;s a wachtell , lipton , klein restaurant .
okay . fine .
what about this place ?
yeah , that &apos;d be great if it was 2004 .
oh , my god .
why does any of this matter ? god .
you see that guy over there by the fax ?
take a good look .
he &apos;s never gonna make partner .
okay . let me guess .
because he threw a lousy rookie dinner ?
no , because he doesn &apos;t get it .
get what ?
he doesn &apos;t get that doing good work
isn &apos;t the whole job .
part of getting it
is that things like the dinner actually matter ,
even when you don &apos;t think they do .
look , you were giving me shit this morning
because i come and go when i want to .
you know why i can do that ?
because when i got here , i dominated .
they thought i worked 100 hours a day .
now , no matter what time i get in ,
nobody questions my ability to get the job done .
get it through your head .
first impressions last .
you start behind the eight ball ,
you &apos;ll never get in front .
hey , you busy ?
it &apos;s 7 : 00 .
i &apos;m not here &apos; cause i like the view .
and don &apos;t misunderstand me .
when i say &quot; the view , &quot; i &apos;m referring to your face .
that &apos;s funny , because i &apos;m hideous .
what &apos;s up ?
you &apos;re a foodie , right ?
why do you say that ?
because you &apos;re the only person
i &apos;ve ever seen order a shrimp , red pepper ,
and goat cheese pizza .
well , right , but without the pepper ,
what connects the goat cheese and the shrimp ?
i &apos;m a foodie .
okay , so i need your help finding a restaurant
for the rookie dinner .
well , that &apos;s unfortunate ,
but i &apos;m swamped ,
and i don &apos;t have time to teach you about cuisine .
well , no , don &apos;t make me remind you
that you owe me one .
how &apos;s that ?
you told louis i was working on harvey &apos;s case before his .
because you told me to .
well , now i &apos;m telling you to help me with my dinner .
good luck with that .
not gonna help me with my dinner .
now i &apos;m talking to myself .
yeah , grammy .
no , i told you i was coming .
i &apos;m-- i &apos;m on my way , okay ? yeah .
15 minutes .
okay . bye . hey , what are you--
okay , what was that for ?
if you cared about me ,
you would have told me what trevor was up to
a long time ago .
i was trying to protect you .
how is hiding the fact
that my boyfriend is selling weed protecting me ?
you want to know the truth ?
your boyfriend also happens to be my best friend , all right ?
i didn &apos;t feel like ratting him out .
if you were really his friend ,
you wouldn &apos;t just stand by and let him throw his life away .
let him ? let--
i &apos;ve never let trevor do anything .
have you met him ?
trevor listens to you ,
and he needs you right now .
he is throwing his life away ,
and you ditched us .
both .
like we didn &apos;t mean anything to you .
i &apos;m ... i &apos;m late .
louis . what are you doing here ?
hi . uh , stensland called .
and apparently the diligence wasn &apos;t proceeding apace .
he called you ?
yeah , he called me , i called him , what &apos;s the difference ?
the paperwork was taking too long ,
and i got it done .
i suggest you stay the hell away from my client .
harvey . glad you could make it .
we were about to sign the papers .
i got word back at the office .
i just came to see how louis
was getting around the bylaws .
i ... don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m at somewhat of a loss .
robert , i &apos;m sorry .
this is what was holding up your due diligence .
technically , you &apos;re still interim ceo until the board
votes you in on thursday .
if protocol isn &apos;t followed ,
it leaves you with huge litigation exposure .
that &apos;s right .
well , i imagine we should hold off , then .
please don &apos;t blame louis . it &apos;s my fault .
we usually have senior partners oversee transactions like this
because junior partners , they tend to miss things .
see you thursday ?
one second .
uh , just so you know ,
you were a junior partner until recently .
there &apos;s a reason i &apos;m not anymore .
okay . take it easy .
so what if you took a trip to russia with another man ?
i mean , that was before you met grandpa jimmy , right ?
he didn &apos;t care it was before i met him .
never shut up about it .
so what was this other guy &apos;s name ?
gregory . mind your own business .
so , michael , this has been fun .
now why don &apos;t you stop beating around the bush
and tell me what &apos;s going on .
trevor .
it &apos;s trevor . it &apos;s always trevor .
he &apos;s gotten himself into some really bad ...
stuff , and i think he needs my help to get out of it ,
but i &apos;ve been under so much pressure ,
and i know you &apos;ve always told me to be there for people ...
no , no , listen to me .
screw trevor .
what ?
you &apos;re moving forward ,
and he &apos;ll do whatever he can to keep you where you are .
yeah , but ...
but no buts .
that kid is an anchor .
you need to cut him loose .
you owe me 50 bucks .
what &apos;s going on with robert stensland ?
what did louis tell you ?
you &apos;re not dealing with louis . you &apos;re dealing with me .
what are you hiding ?
nothing . i looked through the bylaws
and precluded potential litigation .
you looked at the bylaws for a tactical reason ,
and i want to know what it is .
i want him out .
that is not your call . you are an attorney .
this is the internal business of mckernon motors .
look , mckernon had a plan ,
and i didn &apos;t spend a decade shaping it
to let this fool throw it away .
mckernon is dead .
so what ? doesn &apos;t mean the plan &apos;s no good .
you fail , we &apos;ll get fired .
he moves overseas ,
our billables &apos;ll be gone in five years , anyway .
better five years than nothing .
you know what ? that &apos;s stensland &apos;s attitude ,
and it &apos;s a losing one .
harvey , i don &apos;t think you have any business
telling that man how to run his company ,
but i know you don &apos;t have any business
telling me how to run mine .
you are a senior partner .
you are not a gunslinger anymore .
back off stensland and close the deal .
i need you to prepare the draft ceo candidate speech for thursday .
well , i thought you were supposed to back off .
yeah , i &apos;m supposed to do a lot of things .
i &apos;ll call you with the plan on my way back .
from where ?
from convincing the man who hates me to do what i say .
oh , right .
you mean the guy i suggested you go to in the first place .
do you remember that
whole getting it thing i was talking to you about ?
what , i can &apos;t even gloat ?
gloating &apos;s fine . you just have to not suck at it .
okay . thank you . so much .
that hurt .
hey , ross .
you left your search for the rookie dinner on your computer .
why don &apos;t you just save time
and take us to friday &apos;s ?
ooh , ooh , somebody &apos;s mad .
devon , looking at my computer is a violation of
exactly seven hostile workplace environment statutes .
what are you gonna do ? sue me ?
no . no , no , no .
i &apos;m just gonna use it as legal cover
if i decide to kick your ass .
dominic .
harvey , what are you doing here ?
our contract &apos;s good for two more years .
i need a word . in private .
excuse me , bill .
make it fast , &apos; cause this is a place
where people actually work for a living .
well , keep in mind people are watching .
just try to keep your expression neutral .
you know , they don &apos;t teach deceptive tactics where i come from .
then you &apos;re gonna learn under fire .
stensland &apos;s shutting you down .
what ? why ?
for money .
he &apos;s got a buyer for the land under the factory .
why are you coming to me ?
because the only way to stop him
is for you to challenge him as ceo .
what ? are you crazy ?
you &apos;ve got a management title .
that i choose not to identify with .
you run the factory .
which i never left , &apos; cause i have no taste for boardroom politics .
you &apos;ve been here since day one .
you know the product inside out .
these workers , they respect you .
pew , that &apos;s a lot of smoke .
how many people did you go to before me ?
seven .
right .
i never said you were my prom queen .
look , i want to win , okay ?
i went to those other people
because they were better suited to get past the board ,
not better suited for the job .
those are the facts whether you like it or not .
and why should i trust you ?
because if you don &apos;t , there aren &apos;t any jobs left to negotiate over .
you and the factory , you &apos;re finished .
我们快回来了 在会议室等我
what are you working on ?
um , nothing . just some stuff for harvey . why ?
wrap it up . louis litt wants to see you .
this time he doesn &apos;t want to wait .
晚上八点在哥伦布大街等我 别迟到
furthermore ,
i feel that with the proper
strategic and synergistic alliances moving forward--
i have to actually believe what you &apos;re saying .
they &apos;re just platitudes that don &apos;t mean anything .
yes , they do .
synergistic alliances mean you form relationships
to get the cost down and your product out .
it &apos;s never gonna work .
well , it better goddamn work . my ass is on the line .
what about my ass ?
if it wasn &apos;t attached to your thick head ,
maybe we wouldn &apos;t be having this problem .
i &apos;m sorry i &apos;m not as well practiced
at corporate double speak as you &apos;d like ,
but i &apos;ve been busting my ass on this for two hours .
so if you &apos;re not happy with my progress ,
then why don &apos;t you get the hell out ?
he doesn &apos;t leave without getting it .
son of a bitch .
you &apos;re not gonna pick it up ?
why should i ? never gonna get it .
you &apos;re right .
hey , can i ask you something ?
what &apos;s your engine design philosophy ?
perfectly balanced power and durability .
okay . why don &apos;t you favor power like bronson does ?
because drivers are limited to eight engines a season ,
and bronson &apos;s don &apos;t last .
well , so you would stack your engines
up against bronson &apos;s , then ?
uh , i have stacked my engines up against bronson
and everyone else &apos;s in the world ,
and mine win .
why ?
because i make sure
they &apos;re designed better than anyone else &apos;s in the world
from the day that they &apos;re conceived to the day they &apos;re born .
and that &apos;s why people buy them .
goddamn right .
and that &apos;s the speech you &apos;re gonna give .
good lawyer , bad lawyer , baby .
worked like a charm .
come on . you know you want it .
there it is .
told you .
someone doesn &apos;t like you ,
you use it against them .
or , in this case , for them .
i didn &apos;t do this for dominic .
i did it to get rid of stensland .
wow . have you ever considered writing for hallmark ?
many times .
yeah .
congrats .
looking good .
i said don &apos;t be late .
late ? i &apos;m not late .
when you host your dinner here ,
not being late means getting here a half hour early .
aha . so what made you change your mind ?
the food items are samples to help you select your menu ,
so since i could never really afford to eat here myself ...
okay , start there .
try that ?
yes .
it looks kind of funny .
so does an egg roll .
i don &apos;t accept that premise .
you want my help or not ?
ugh . what is that ?
squid .
i-- i think it &apos;s still moving .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m talking about .
i don &apos;t get it .
how do you have no appreciation for fine food ?
mm . we didn &apos;t have a lot of money growing up . i don &apos;t know .
i guess i &apos;m just comfortable with what i &apos;m comfortable with .
that is the exact opposite of me .
i &apos;ve-- i &apos;ve always loved new experiences .
and your parents ?
they &apos;re loaded .
mm . so then what do you need a free meal for ?
i want to live on what i make .
what ?
nothing .
i was just thinking about dominic for a second .
and then i realized this is the first time in weeks
that i haven &apos;t been thinking about work .
that &apos;s what new experiences do for you .
being a foodie doesn &apos;t mean only liking fancy food .
means having the courage to try it .
and then you get to serve what you like .
except strawberries , peanuts , gluten , and chicken .
okay , why not those things ?
because louis is an asshole .
if you can &apos;t serve things just &apos; cause louis is an asshole ,
you &apos;re not gonna have that many choices .
good point .
so what really made you change your mind ?
pity .
i &apos;ll take it .
driver , taketh me to williamsburg .
it &apos;s jenny .
trevor told me you talked to him ,
and he &apos;s gonna stop .
thanks , mike .
hold on .
change of destination .
trevor .
what are you doing here ?
can we talk for a minute ?
yeah .
i know you lied to jenny about us talking .
you never should have told her i was dealing in the first place .
i never should have had to hide it in the first place .
look , trevor , you don &apos;t need to be dealing for a living , man .
you could make something of yourself .
is that what you came here to tell me ?
you &apos;ve got real software clients , man .
stick to them .
jeez . you believe that crap ?
i don &apos;t have any software clients .
jesus . you &apos;re as naive as jenny .
look ...
if you need some kind of transition money or something--
what ? how ?
does it matter ?
look , what matters is that you don &apos;t help me out , okay ?
i help you out .
and i &apos;m not interested in transitioning into anything .
okay .
but the least you could do is be honest with jenny .
that &apos;s what this is all about .
yeah .
you always liked her .
i think she deserves to know the truth .
you always thought you were better than me .
maybe that &apos;s because i am .
come on now . all right ?
we &apos;re done .
don &apos;t let the door hit you--
call dominic ?
he &apos;s waiting for us outside .
he &apos;s got the speech down ?
yeah , he &apos;s got it down .
better . i &apos;m taking a big risk on him .
you &apos;re taking a risk on him ?
look at him .
he &apos;s scared out of his mind .
he &apos;s leaving his comfort zone
because you convinced him to .
so ?
so maybe some words of encouragement .
the best way to help dominic
is not to let him second guess himself .
the most important asset an attorney has
is his ability to always be self @-@ assured .
okay . here &apos;s what &apos;s gonna happen .
it &apos;s standard for me to prep the board on any voting procedure .
when do i speak ?
when i tell you to . let &apos;s go .
i suggested to stensland you be there
to convince the board the production won &apos;t be hurt
by an overseas move .
it helps your credibility that he brought you here ,
and it &apos;ll hurt his when you challenge him for ceo .
look , it &apos;s natural to be nervous , okay ?
just remember , you know your stuff .
the board &apos;s never loved stensland ,
and i &apos;m here to back you up .
okay .
robert .
harvey .
you know , i have to admit , i almost didn &apos;t see it coming .
excuse me ?
it was the delay in the due diligence .
it just didn &apos;t smell right .
so the only thing it could be
was that you were going after my ceo appointment .
so since i &apos;m still within my rights to move a board meeting ,
i did .
i was voted in today at noon .
and tomorrow the board will ratify the sale of the factory .
and now i &apos;m firing your firm .
and i &apos;m firing you .
try the croissant , gentlemen .
marmalade &apos;s fantastic .
what are we gonna do ?
you &apos;re gonna go through those bylaws again ,
and see if there isn &apos;t another way we can stop this sale .
i &apos;m talking about dominic . he just lost his job .
he &apos;s a grown man . he made a decision .
because you convinced him to .
based on your idea ,
which i recall you pushed on me at the time .
because i thought it would work at the time .
well , it didn &apos;t . what do you want me to do about it ?
help him .
he &apos;s not dying . he lost his job .
he has to look for another one .
which , if he hadn &apos;t chosen to fight for
his company in the first place ,
would have happened anyway .
now , show me that you get it ,
go back through those bylaws again ,
and see if you missed anything . okay ?
so this is what happens when you promote the wrong guy
to senior partner .
if you hadn &apos;t gone to stensland behind my back ,
this wouldn &apos;t have happened .
you don &apos;t know that .
and i &apos;m a member of this firm just as much of you .
oh , i think we both agree that you &apos;re a member .
for your information , i didn &apos;t even--
louis . harvey , eye on the ball .
the issue here is you tried to torpedo a client--
the client is mckernon motors , not stensland .
you didn &apos;t let me finish .
without my consent .
that trumps the &quot; who &apos;s the client &quot; part .
louis , go to stensland , repair the relationship .
say what you have to . call it a misunderstanding .
promise harvey is no longer involved .
consider it done .
wait a second .
louis didn &apos;t go to stensland behind my back .
you send him there to hedge your bets .
either stensland &apos;s out and we double our billings ,
or you have plausible deniability ,
and he stays with the firm .
am i smart enough to do that ?
if i win , i look great .
if louis wins , he looks great .
either way ... you look great .
you mean the firm looks great .
harvey , what i &apos;ve been trying to get into your head
is that you bought in .
you are the firm .
that &apos;s it .
mike , follow me .
i need you to go talk to dominic .
what ? why ? stensland &apos;s already ceo .
that won &apos;t matter if we just buy the damn company .
what ?
why are you still working ?
it &apos;s one of my creations .
i &apos;m not leaving it unfinished .
what the hell do you want ?
i &apos;d be happy to tell you if you put that wrench down .
yeah , you &apos;re quick with the jokes .
i &apos;m the guy who just got fired .
you &apos;re right . i &apos;m sorry .
what would you say if i told you
we could get your job back and stick it to stensland .
i &apos;m done with harvey and his plans , yeah ?
you were there . we got fired too .
you and harvey still have jobs ?
he doesn &apos;t care about anybody but himself ,
including you , mike .
yeah . you &apos;re probably right .
but he did stick his neck out to keep your company here ,
and he does have an idea that requires your help ,
so you can stay here and call him an asshole ,
or you can come with me and we can help him .
give me my goddamn shirt .
you know , it goes from 0 to 60--
in the blink of an eye .
did you bring me down here to tell me i can drive this ?
better .
for $ 250 million , you can own it .
mckernon motors is for sale ?
if we act fast .
i &apos;ll need to see the financials .
you put together a letter of intent ,
they &apos;ll get you the financials .
you know , their real asset is engine quality .
i don &apos;t want to just buy the name .
speak of the devil .
laurence , i &apos;d like you to meet the man responsible
for every mckernon motors engine ever built .
dominic barone . very nice to meet you .
good to meet you .
i &apos;d like to show you something if you have a minute .
absolutely .
so how do we get an offer to the board
before they vote to ratify the deal tomorrow ?
you &apos;re gonna go through those bylaws ,
and you &apos;re gonna figure something out .
i don &apos;t have to look through them to figure it out ,
because i just did .
well , what took you so long ?
you trying to look like me ?
each of you have 24 hours
to review the documents in front of you ,
so at this time ...
excuse me . excuse me .
what is he doing here ?
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m gonna take care of this .
no , no , i will .
you gentlemen have no right to attend this meeting .
actually , we do .
the bylaw states that any original employee
has the right to petition the board any time they meet .
dominic barone has assigned that right to me .
he was fired .
he no longer has that right .
per section 17 @-@ 5 , point &quot; c , &quot;
dominic wasn &apos;t given three days &apos; notice ,
so technically he wasn &apos;t fired .
which is why i do have the right to urge the board
to accept the offer for the purchase of mckernon motors .
now , i can tell you that this offer
will keep manufacturing here and save jobs
while retaining the flagship engine that put this company on the map ,
but i don &apos;t have to ,
because it happens to be for way more goddamn money
than the one in front of you right now .
hey , bob . how are ya ?
it &apos;s funny how you held out on me
on that proper notice exception .
i didn &apos;t hold out .
i made that up on the spot .
really ? on the spot ?
remember that getting it stuff--
i know , right ? i &apos;m getting it .
well , i was gonna say that , but now you ruined it .
that &apos;s one thing you definitely get .
how to ruin it .
how to ruin it ?
i heard that .
i have to admit , you don &apos;t suck .
i wish i could say the same for you .
time to pay the piper . just so you know ,
i took the liberty of ordering some really expensive wines .
hope that &apos;s okay .
sorry , sir , but the check &apos;s been paid for in full
by a harvey specter .
there , uh , might have been some gluten in the ravioli .
i hear mckernon motors is getting a new owner .
we &apos;re not only handling the sale ,
but with the expansion plan they &apos;re putting in place ,
our billables should double .
nicely done .
i did it for the firm .
what are you doing here ?
you were right .
i should never have kept it from you
that trevor was dealing all that time .
well , i mean , it &apos;s , uh ...
it &apos;s all in the past , right ?
no .
what are you talking about ?
he &apos;s lying to you .
he &apos;s still dealing .
and i &apos;m done with him .
son of a bitch .
well , thank you , uh , for telling me .
no , don &apos;t . stop .
we &apos;re even .
and that is the last time i am ever ratting on anyone .
so if you fall for it again ...
it &apos;s on you .
are you angry with me ?
you told me he would listen to me .
i thought he would .
well , he didn &apos;t .
i ...
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m s-- i &apos;m sorry .
no , i can &apos;t .
i can &apos;t .
what ?
no , i-- i fought with him .
oh , god .
this is too much .
