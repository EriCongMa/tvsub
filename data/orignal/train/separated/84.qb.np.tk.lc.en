and does this abandoned pool
belong to one of your foreclosed properties ?
it belongs to one of the properties
where the householder could not repay his loan .
and therefore , we exercised our prerogative
as the bank holding the lease to foreclose .
and this pool at 233 graham court ...
can i interrupt here ?
it would save us all a lot of time to just stipulate
that the five swimming pools are part
of the foreclosure package exercised
by the atlantic commerce bank .
good . if you stipulate to that ,
it will save us time .
i &apos;ll be right back .
you okay , kaley ?
yeah . thank you , mr. gardner .
how &apos;s it going ?
pulling teeth .
what &apos;s that ?
notice of mediation .
for ?
both of us . wednesday .
why ?
the bankruptcy .
we have another five weeks .
i know .
we need 60 million by february .
and yet , one of our creditors
wants a mediation on our progress .
which one ?
i don &apos;t know .
check with clarke .
if we &apos;re being called on the carpet , he is , too .
hmm . wouldn &apos;t hurt to go in with the 15 million
from atlantic commerce .
we went down to 13 .
it would be nice to
keep that settlement above ten .
i &apos;m doing my best .
counsel , please tell your client to stop evading and answer .
yes , after you rephrase .
very simply , sir , you foreclosed on these ...
the homeowners neglected to pay .
you left these homes abandoned , you left these pools ...
we did nothing . these pools ?
no , sir . after you kicked the homeowners out ,
you did nothing with the swimming pools .
you let the water stagnate .
the water was stagnant already .
and that water drew mosquitoes . these mosquitoes , to be exact .
and those mosquitoes carried west nile virus to my client ,
kaley spence .
oh , come on .
palsgraf v. long island railroad .
there is no way that mr. millam and his bank
could know of this proximate cause .
good , then let your client testify to that .
because what i have here is a warning from the cdc
mentioning your pools as the culprit .
we were not aware of that .
&quot; we &quot; ?
are we speaking for the whole bank here ?
i was not aware of that .
well , were you aware
of this letter of complaint written
by the neighbors , including mrs. spence ,
about the declining conditions of the foreclosed homes ,
including the pools ?
no . i was not aware of it .
you can see it was not addressed to me .
yes . it was addressed to your bank president , wilkes ingersol .
luckily , that &apos;s who we &apos;re deposing next .
it &apos;s up to you now , alicia .
they sent it up the line to the bank president .
i &apos;m supposed to depose him in ten minutes .
how &apos;s minnesota ?
quiet .
ask the president if he ever saw the letter
from the homeowners . if he lies , we got them .
they don &apos;t know we have the notes
from the bank &apos;s quarterly meeting .
get his backtracking on record , and we win .
okay . i &apos;ll call you back in a few hours .
wow , look who &apos;s here .
everywhere i turn .
alicia . what a pleasant surprise .
how &apos;s bankruptcy going ?
that which doesn &apos;t kill us makes us stronger .
yeah , well , then you &apos;re gonna be pretty strong .
so , where are we ?
uh , the business center .
they got a business center here ?
for the record , i want to restate our agreement .
mr. ingersol &apos;s a busy man , and he can only offer you
three hours for your deposition .
after that , he has to get back to his ranch .
for his vacation ?
his working vacation .
chopping wood ? milking cows ?
it &apos;s hard work .
so , we &apos;re in agreement , mrs. florrick , about three hours ?
if it &apos;s a true three hours , yes .
and if you &apos;re in agreement to have the judge
on call so that she can immediately
settle any and all objections .
yes , of course .
are you getting cell phone coverage here ?
if i stand on my bed and put my arms over my head .
okay , we &apos;re ready .
so , the clock will start
as soon as he walks through that door .
as soon as he sits in that chair .
oh , let &apos;s not quibble .
good . then the chair .
wilkes ingersol .
i &apos;m the president of the atlantic commerce bank ,
and a trustee of the mercantile exchange .
well , it &apos;s nice to finally meet you , mr. ingersol .
you &apos;re a hard man to find .
really ? well ...
that &apos;s not what my accountant says .
we &apos;ve been trying to depose you for 14 months now .
mrs. florrick , if you wanted to read that into the record ,
you could have done so before mr. ingersol arrived .
it &apos;s all right , louis . my apologies , ma &apos;am .
i don &apos;t mean to be flippant .
thank you for arranging this deposition near my ranch .
i hope you weren &apos;t inconvenienced .
i &apos;m fine .
now , sir , if we could turn to these foreclosed homes
and their swimming pools ...
yes . um , could i say something first ?
certainly , sir .
i understand there are a lot of homeowners
who are underwater .
i understand many homebuyers were enticed into taking on
adjustable mortgages that eventually bankrupt them .
but what i often think is that banks
are made the bad guys in these equations ,
and that is unwarranted .
thank you , sir .
but what i wholly condemn
are any efforts to advance political causes
through legal means .
i mean , for example ,
uh , communities using eminent domain
to address bank foreclosures .
or here , using this painful circumstance of a young child
with west nile virus
to force us to change our methods on foreclosures .
i think you &apos;ve been misinformed , mr. ingersol .
kaley spence is suing you for $ 15 million .
13 million .
she &apos;s suing you because she had a promising career
as a ballet dancer ,
and now she needs full @-@ time care .
we don &apos;t need the photos .
i think we do .
please leave them .
she &apos;s a lovely girl .
i have a 15 @-@ year @-@ old daughter myself .
sir , did you see this letter ,
written by the residents of the community complaining
about the state of these foreclosed homes ?
objection . we have no foundation for this letter .
mr. canning , this is a deposition .
there &apos;s no need for foundation .
that &apos;s not true , mrs. florrick , and i won &apos;t have
mr. ingersol sandbagged ...
then let &apos;s call the judge .
she made you sit down for this deposition .
she will make you address my question .
i &apos;m sorry , mrs. florrick .
we &apos;re gonna have to leave it there .
no . wha ... wait a minute .
i just received an emergency text i have to address .
sir , you have barely been here for three minutes .
i have only asked you one question .
two .
no , one .
the judge was explicit in her ruling .
if we made the effort to be near your ranch ,
you must sit down with us
for at least three hours .
and i will .
but , again , this is an emergency .
no , sir !
i &apos;ll be back this afternoon at 2 : 00 .
please be patient . you will get your time .
i promise you .
well , that is unfortunate .
no , i think you &apos;re doing well .
we expected a bump in maddie &apos;s polling .
she &apos;s the fresh new thing .
yes , we expected that , too .
we &apos;re still beating her 47 to 42.5 .
that &apos;s outside the margin of error .
i know . we &apos;re not worried .
and yet you &apos;re here .
it &apos;s a visit .
the democratic committee has a lot invested in your boy florrick .
we want to make sure he wins .
and you &apos;re worried he won &apos;t ?
i &apos;m worried the sun won &apos;t rise tomorrow , eli .
it &apos;s a visit . that &apos;s all .
thank you .
come again sometime .
i heard something .
something that worried me .
i heard your offices were raided .
it &apos;s nothing , frank .
it &apos;s not nothing .
no raid is nothing . a raid is something .
it &apos;s not about the candidate .
i know it &apos;s not about the candidate . it &apos;s about you .
i &apos;m not hiding anything from you .
there are forces
within the justice department
that do not want peter to win the governorship .
now , they don &apos;t have the facts to come after him ,
so they &apos;re coming after me as a steppingstone to peter .
and they have the facts to come after you ?
n @-@ no .
i &apos;m just saying , they know
that peter without me would be limping .
so , they want this .
they want you coming to me suggesting ...
what are you suggesting ?
not that you resign .
you &apos;re not an issue yet .
but you need a strong second
in case you do become an issue .
i know you don &apos;t like it , eli .
but you need a second .
so , 2 : 00 p.m. , huh ?
yes . i &apos;m not sure what happened .
the judge won &apos;t be happy .
mr. ingersol is a very ...
if i hear one more time how busy mr. ingersol is ,
i will strangle you .
hello ?
yeah , yeah . i understand .
no , uh , she &apos;s here . i &apos;ll tell her .
okay , thank you . bye .
mr. ingersol would like to apologize ...
let &apos;s get the judge on the line .
it &apos;s an emergency .
he said he just has to delay until tomorrow morning .
he set aside three hours starting at 10 : 00 .
he won &apos;t count today &apos;s ten minutes against it .
he wanted me to apologize to you personally .
he said he really enjoyed his time with you this morning .
let the record reflect
that mr. ingersol has refused to attend ...
he didn &apos;t refuse to attend . ...
failed to appear
in a court @-@ mandated deposition , despite promising to attend
between the hours of 2 : 00 and 5 : 00 p.m. today .
alicia , you might want to look at this tonight .
the cdc has revised their report .
it seems there &apos;s another possible cause for the outbreak
of west nile virus besides just our swimming pools .
a koi pond ? !
yes , from a house that wasn &apos;t foreclosed .
damn it .
the cdc report isn &apos;t saying
it &apos;s definitely from the koi pond
or from the swimming pools .
but the koi pond also had stagnant water .
the bank just got its wiggle room .
yup .
okay , alicia , we &apos;ll handle this on our end .
you just get the bank president on record
about the neighbors &apos; letter .
when is he supposed to arrive ?
10 : 00 a.m. tomorrow , but i think i &apos;m getting the runaround .
yeah . they &apos;ll probably wait until you &apos;re out get
breakfast or something , then they &apos;ll tell the judge
the witness was available , but they couldn &apos;t find you .
mm . unfortunately , you &apos;ll have to outwait them .
stay close to your room so they can &apos;t say you were out .
oh . yeah , okay . but i was only planning to stay for one night .
we &apos;ll get clothes and incidentals out to you .
mr. hayden .
hello . i &apos;ve been trying to get to you all day .
yes . i &apos;ve been in meetings
do you have a minute ?
no , actually , i don &apos;t .
have you , uh , received a notice of mediation ?
no .
but you ...
mr. hayden , is @-@ is there something i should know ?
i requested the mediation .
you ?
why ?
you need to be removed from your positions .
the firm can &apos;t be merged with you in control .
mr. hayden , this is ...
we &apos;ve been nothing but cordial .
this is not about cordial .
i had a firm ready to merge ,
to pay off your creditors , and you sabotaged it .
it was a bad deal . they wanted to break us up .
yes , they did . that &apos;s exactly the point , ms. lockhart .
you have creditors , you owe them money .
they are not interested in your self @-@ fulfillment .
they are interested in their money .
then let us make them their money .
well , you &apos;ll have a chance to argue that in mediation .
if we merge the firm , the creditors will receive
70 cents on the dollar right now .
or they can trust that you will bring this firm back .
either way , i &apos;ll see you in mediation .
no , no , take it .
no , no .
i &apos;m fine . you .
i probably have more in my room .
are you sure ? i can split it with you .
no , that &apos;d be messy .
thanks . i think the next store is 50 miles away .
are you here for the air show ?
no .
there &apos;s an air show ?
yeah , i think so .
the hotel clerk kept talking about it . it was ...
oh . excuse me . i have to run .
mr. canning ! hi . i &apos;m here . i &apos;m here . what &apos;s up ?
oh , yeah , alicia , i was ... i was just about to leave you a note .
mr. ingersol can come in earlier this morning .
right now , as a matter of fact .
uh , we thought we &apos;d missed you .
i &apos;m ready . i will meet you at the business center .
right .
must have been delayed .
that seems to happen a lot .
i have a friend who ... who &apos;s dying .
wants me to give the eulogy at @-@ at his funeral .
he just e @-@ mailed me .
he &apos;s dying , and he sent you an e @-@ mail ?
his wife did .
i hate that people my age are starting to die .
it &apos;s really horrible .
it is .
he was my roommate in college .
ian keyes .
smartest guy i ever met .
ever give a eulogy ?
yes .
to someone close ?
yes .
who ?
my father .
i &apos;m sorry .
how old was he when he died ?
60 .
that &apos;s young .
it is .
am i upsetting you ?
no . um , why don &apos;t you call mr. ingersol ,
and see what time he &apos;s gonna be here ?
i &apos;m not playing you , alicia . he &apos;s coming .
i know .
yeah . we &apos;re here .
no ?
okay , wh @-@ when ?
all right , well , just keep me in touch .
2 : 00 this afternoon .
let the record reflect
that mr. ingersol has refused to appear
at a court @-@ mandated deposition ...
again .
you sure you want to do this ?
what &apos;s the downside ?
you &apos;re a low priority .
provoking them with a harassment suit
could make you a high priority .
i don &apos;t think i have any option .
i &apos;m sorry to keep you waiting .
i &apos;m brand @-@ new on this case , and there was a disagreement
about who should take this meeting .
ms. lockhart , mr. gold ,
good to see you again .
oh , come on !
this is a conflict of interest .
what &apos;s that , mr. gold ?
you ran against my boss . you lost .
i beat you .
yes , that &apos;s true .
two years ago .
you asked for a proffer against mr. florrick .
that is a conflict of interest .
no , that was my investigator , mr. laguardia .
i have since rescinded that offer .
discounts for donations is a serious business , mr. gold .
the doj takes it very seriously .
god . no one disappears .
they all come back , like zombies .
eli . this is a complaint , ms. scott @-@ carr ,
against the doj and your department .
we are charging you with harassment .
please read it .
i will .
and i &apos;ll have my secretary contact you
about a time to interview .
you want to beat peter , do it at the ballot box .
don &apos;t use this petty ploy .
this is not about beating peter .
so you &apos;re angry at me now ?
do i look angry ?
my directive here is simple :
clean up political corruption .
that &apos;s all .
you underestimate me
if you think i &apos;m working from bias .
i &apos;ll be in touch .
and you &apos;ll read our complaint ?
oh , yes . i have it right here .
sorry , i have to get to my next meeting .
hello ?
oh , hi .
i just saw you had to run off , so , i ...
oh , my gosh .
you didn &apos;t have to do that .
i know . it was nothing .
well , thank you .
uh ... what do i owe you ?
no , no , no , nothing .
well , i have to pay you something .
no , you don &apos;t . no . next time . i &apos;m simone .
oh , um , alicia .
there aren &apos;t many people around here .
yes , i know .
it &apos;s so strange that they built this big hotel up here .
so , are you here for vacation or something ?
oh , no . work . you ?
oh , my husband &apos;s here for work .
you are probably the lawyer that he &apos;s here to meet .
are you mrs. canning ?
yes . are you mrs. florrick ?
yes .
my husband speaks so highly of you .
he does ?
yes .
he does . he thinks you &apos;re fantastic .
for a while there , i thought i should be jealous .
i &apos;m joking .
but we should have breakfast sometime .
you know , if we &apos;re going to be here for a while .
are we going to be here for a while ?
i don &apos;t know . you tell me .
well , it was really nice to meet you .
so , i &apos;ll call you for breakfast ?
good . yeah .
okay .
simone ?
yes ?
i was so sorry to hear about your husband &apos;s friend .
the one who &apos;s dying ?
who &apos;s that ?
oh , never mind . it was my mistake .
it was lovely to meet you , simone .
you , as well , alicia .
good job , kalinda . he &apos;s sure ?
yeah . look , as far as i can tell ,
the aedus ... eedus ... ? aed ... ?
aedes albopictus .
the ...
this kind of mosquito breed doesn &apos;t transmit west nile ,
so it couldn &apos;t have come from the koi pond .
that virus is transmitted by the ae @-@ aed ...
the other one ?
aedes aegypti .
aedes aegypti .
by a different type of mosquito .
excellent . very good .
just get him on the record .
ah , that &apos;ll be fun .
we &apos;ll call you back , kalinda .
what &apos;s going on out there ?
he &apos;s getting cary in line to testify against us .
i just want to make sure we &apos;re on the same page .
i think we are . yeah .
good . thank you , cary .
cary ?
yes ?
what was clarke discussing with you ?
uh , nothing . he just wanted to know
about the clients who left last week .
and what did you say ?
i said nothing .
i just listened .
we &apos;re just a little
worried he &apos;s trying to line up a case against us , cary .
and that he might use you .
do you think that &apos;s a possibility ?
he didn &apos;t say anything about that .
can we , um , talk to you , cary ,
about possibly testifying for us ?
2 : 30 . and here we are again .
why don &apos;t you go for a walk ? i &apos;ll get you when he comes .
how &apos;s your friend who &apos;s dying ?
have you heard any more from him ?
no . why ?
maybe you should call him .
maybe he &apos;s dead .
excuse me ?
oh , i &apos;m sorry .
am i being insensitive ?
how &apos;s the eulogy coming ?
i mean , maybe you could ask simone to help you on that .
you met my wife .
yes , i did .
she &apos;s wonderful .
yes , she &apos;s ... my better half .
she &apos;s your only half .
funny , she &apos;d never heard of ian keyes , your roommate .
yeah , well ...
i don &apos;t share everything with her .
your lies , for example .
you don &apos;t share your lies ?
no .
those i save for you .
what was even the point
of lying about a dying friend ?
i don &apos;t know . it was a way of connecting .
didn &apos;t you feel we were connected ?
how does a bastard like you end up with such a wonderful wife ?
women like bastards .
didn &apos;t you notice that ? it &apos;s like a challenge .
beauty and the beast .
it fits in with all the fairy tales you grew up consuming .
oh , my god .
oh , there &apos;s godot .
hello .
all right . really ?
let the record show that mr. ingersol has refused
to attend a court @-@ mandated deposition for the fourth time .
he was literally a minute away when he had another call .
oh , really ? just a minute away ? wow .
he says he can reschedule for tomorrow at 10 : 00 .
okay , sure . um , it &apos;ll just ...
it &apos;ll give you some time to read this .
it &apos;s saying that the cdc is updating their report again .
the mosquito carrying
the west nile virus could not have come from the koi pond .
that &apos;s the wrong kind of mosquito .
the right kind of mosquito could only
have come from the swimming pools .
so , nice try , mr. canning , but you lost .
and every day that this deposition is delayed ,
the judge is getting angrier , so ...
... might want to rethink your strategy .
yeah , it &apos;s me .
yeah , i need you to look into something .
so , kaley , hi .
hi .
i just want to ask you a few questions ,
and i know they might seem odd to you ,
but please bear with me .
have you ever heard of aedes aegypti ?
no .
well , i can understand why .
that &apos;s a very long word for a very small mosquito .
you don &apos;t have to patronize her . she &apos;s not eight years old .
thank you , mr. agos .
this is an aedes aegypti , kaley .
this is the breed of mosquito that carries the west nile virus .
we didn &apos;t know that until your attorneys pointed it out ,
so thank you ,
mr. gardner , mr. agos .
what do you have ?
now here are diagrams of the five abandoned swimming pools
that bred the mosquitoes .
seems you &apos;ve dropped the &quot; supposedly &quot; &quot;
are we in agreement ,
the pools bred these mosquitoes ?
yes , we are .
hallelujah .
now , here are five diagrams of the five backyards ,
and do you see here ?
here are the distances between the pools and the perimeter fences .
30 yards , 40 yards . and so on .
do you see ?
yes .
the thing about aedes aegypti :
they are peridomestic mosquitoes .
that means they exhibit short flight ranges
of less than 50 feet .
that means there is no way they could have flown beyond
their respective yards .
are you testifying here , martha ?
all preamble .
here &apos;s my question .
kaley , did you climb the fence
into one of these abandoned yards ?
sorry to ask you again , kaley ,
but you must tell the truth here .
did you climb the fence
into one or more of the yards of these abandoned houses ?
one .
with my friends .
then , i &apos;m sorry , but the plaintiff
trespassed onto our property ,
and we cannot be held liable for that trespass .
this suit is over .
my name is serafina norvey , and before we get started ,
i &apos;d like to set the ground rules for this mediation .
granted , we &apos;re in your offices , and outside those doors ,
you may all be bosses ,
but in here , i am the empress .
now , i understand ,
as the court @-@ appointed trustee ,
you &apos;d like to have the two principals removed as managing partners ?
yes . they blocked a merger of the firm
that i &apos;d arranged with burl preston .
that merger would have met all the financial obligations
of the bankruptcy .
is that true ?
a merger was never part of the original arrangement .
mr. hayden overstepped his authority
when he tried to arrange that deal
before the full term of the five @-@ month deadline .
my job was
to satisfy the terms set down by the court .
actually , it was against the terms of the court ,
in that it did not honor the original timeframe .
also , it worked to undermine our progress .
what progress ?
we &apos;ve managed to raise a great deal of money
in a short amount of time .
how much ?
excuse me ?
how much money ?
$ 20 million .
which is 40 million short of what they need .
and we are very close to finalizing a $ 13 million settlement
with atlantic commerce bank .
they are not &quot; very close . &quot;
they are in deposition .
which is how it works , mr. hayden .
you negotiate in depositions .
you try to stay out of court .
ma &apos;am , if we had a trustee who understood the law ...
excuse me . i know as much as anyone ... !
all right , all right .
this is not marriage court .
i &apos;m not here to make you like each other .
but , ms. lockhart , mr. gardner ,
i think you &apos;re losing sight of the big picture here .
this isn &apos;t about you .
this is about your creditors .
yes , your honor .
&quot; ma &apos;am . &quot;
i &apos;m not a judge .
excuse me , ma &apos;am .
our creditors are voting with their pocketbook
by buying up our debt .
they are ?
yes .
we recently got in touch with our creditors
about this mediation ,
and they informed us that they no longer are our creditors .
a consortium of financiers called encinal equity
has purchased their debt .
and people don &apos;t buy bad debt .
yes , but by that logic ,
your creditors are fleeing your debt by selling it .
people don &apos;t sell good debt .
ma &apos;am , all we ask is
for enough time to present our arguments .
this mediation has come as quite a surprise to us .
how long will you need ?
we should be prepared to present
witnesses and evidence by next week .
tomorrow .
let &apos;s talk about the swimming pool
at 233 graham court .
this one here .
this pool had several water features , correct ?
i &apos;m not sure ? ? what you mean .
in addition to having a deep end and a shallow end ,
there was also a diving board , a waterfall , and a grotto ?
okay . i agree .
was the grotto boarded up after the bank took possession ?
no .
did you receive reports from neighbors
that the waterfall feature was being used by skateboarders ?
where &apos;s this going , gentlemen ?
mr. millam , would you admit
the pool was an attractive nuisance ?
土地主人也应注意保护孩子不受到伤害
objection .
that does not apply here .
kaley climbed a fence to reach the pool .
which makes it a textbook case of attractive nuisance .
it &apos;s the responsibility of the homeowner--
in this case , atlantic commerce bank to secure the swimming pool
and make sure it did not become a danger to children .
once again , there was a fence ,
and your client is not a child .
kaley spence was 12 years old at the time .
a very young , sheltered 12 .
so you were sheltered ? is that it , kaley ?
you want to question our client , depose her .
oh , you sure are well @-@ dressed .
thanks .
and you are in my office .
oh , i see you two have met .
eli gold , jordan karahalios .
the boy wonder .
god , i hate that name .
the ever @-@ quotable rahm emanuel .
never gonna live that down .
we were headed out to see peter .
i figured you two should meet first .
because ... ?
that thing we discussed before ,
about how you needed a second .
i like peter .
he &apos;s not one of those processed sales jobs .
he &apos;s got grit .
jordan wants to offer you guys some time .
he &apos;s had lots of offers .
even maddie hayward , isn &apos;t that right ?
yeah , she &apos;s great .
a little green , maybe .
so , you think you two can work together ?
i heard you like to work alone , jordan .
i do .
but i also like to learn from my elders .
i just want to get an idea
how you might handle certain situations , okay ?
okay .
would you ever go into a store and take something
without paying for it ?
no .
if you got lost in an airport , what would you do ?
find a policeman and ask him to help .
were you ever allowed to stay home alone
without a babysitter ?
sometimes .
well , i used to .
not now , because of what happened to me .
thank you , kaley .
that &apos;s all .
your client is mature enough to understand right and wrong .
attractive nuisance does not apply here .
that &apos;s not for you to decide .
that &apos;s right . it &apos;s for a jury .
which means court .
which means we &apos;re not negotiating a settlement .
damn it .
still in a holding pattern .
he &apos;s supposed to be here in an hour ,
but i &apos;m not holding my breath .
we really need ingersol .
the case is going down the drain .
i think it &apos;s about this merger with corsica pacific .
what do you mean ?
alicia , they &apos;re stalling
because they don &apos;t want a $ 13 million settlement
to mess up this merger .
well , we can &apos;t wait .
alicia , is there any way you can
get proof they &apos;re stalling ?
bad news , unfortunately .
really ? what a surprise .
yeah , it &apos;ll have to be pushed till this afternoon .
something came up at the last minute .
i say , it &apos;s pushed till this afternoon .
i thought we would use this time to depose someone else .
what , for practice ?
rita !
what &apos;s going on here , alicia ?
please have a seat , ms. neves .
would you state your name and your occupation for the record ?
rita neves .
i am a housekeeper here at the janesville mountain retreat .
what , are we playing games here ?
and this morning , were you near enough
to mr. canning to overhear his telephone conversation ?
yes . i was in his room cleaning
while he was talking on the phone .
objection . that &apos;s hearsay .
can you describe what you heard ?
he say , &quot; no , don &apos;t come now .
i call when florrick steps out &quot; &quot;
objection .
that had nothing to do with wilkes ingersol .
is that statement for the record ?
this conversation is totally taken out of context .
it had nothing to do with wilkes ingersol .
it was to my ... partners in chicago .
ed , you can come in now !
what now , mrs. florrick ?
you got some farmers you want to depose ?
can you state your name and occupation ?
ed jeffries . i work at the front desk .
and , um , can you tell me how many calls were made
from mr. canning &apos;s hotel room ?
objection .
your objection has been preserved for the record .
please tell me how many calls
were placed from mr. canning &apos;s room ?
four .
that is private information .
and were all those calls placed to the same number ?
three to the ingersol ranch ,
one to another local number .
so no calls were placed
to mr. canning &apos;s partners in chicago ?
well , there were no calls to chicago .
thank you , ed .
don &apos;t you want to stay for my call to the judge ?
or do you want to be held in contempt in absentia ?
given this evidence , mr. canning ,
i rule for the plaintiff .
present the witness or be held in contempt .
when is the earliest he can be deposed ?
tomorrow morning at 10 : 00 .
your honor , mr. canning has been saying that for two days now .
mr. ingersol is dealing with an ongoing emergency .
mr. canning , have your client there
10 : 00 a.m. or be held in contempt .
do you understand ?
i do .
i &apos;ll see you at 10 : 00 .
i don &apos;t need a lawyer .
yes , but you never know about the future , mr. ellstrom .
tobin .
i &apos;m not in politics anymore , ms. lockhart .
the department of justice is making moves
against past and current campaign managers ,
so i think that you should review your past campaigns .
&quot; making moves &quot; ?
on what issue ?
discounts for donations .
campaign managers offering discounted legal services
in exchange for campaign contributions .
that &apos;s just chicago politics .
and since you were a lawyer prior to your work
as wendy scott @-@ carr &apos;s campaign strategist ,
i thought there might be some issue there .
this is about wendy scott @-@ carr ?
no .
it &apos;s about all your campaign work .
but wendy scott @-@ carr especially ?
okay .
i &apos;ll think about it .
certainly . here &apos;s my card .
don &apos;t forget .
hello , tobin .
how nice to hear from you .
do you know a lawyer named diane lockhart ?
yes , i do . why ?
she just approached me about my past work with you .
she did ?
yeah , she said the department of justice is investigating
discounts for donations ,
and that i might be implicated .
she wanted you to call me .
what ?
she wanted you to call me
so i would know that if i pursue them
on discounts for donations , they &apos;ll pull you in .
no , she just wanted me to hire her .
no , tobin , she didn &apos;t .
this was a warning shot across my bow .
so what are you gonna do ?
we ran a clean campaign , tobin , didn &apos;t we ?
well , yes , but nothing &apos;s 100 % .
no , we ran
a clean campaign .
just don &apos;t talk to her again .
kalinda .
and clothes .
and incidentals .
god , it &apos;s quiet .
yeah .
you &apos;ve had two days of this ?
and two nights .
it &apos;s not that bad , actually .
really ?
i &apos;d kill someone .
you know what i miss about my old life ?
before the glamour of the law ?
what ?
the quiet .
at home , in the afternoons ,
i would drink every day at 3 : 00 .
a glass of red wine .
waiting for the kids to come home .
i miss the silence in the house at 3 : 00 .
just ...
... nothing going on .
i miss this .
yeah .
i &apos;m sorry .
i know .
you know , i don &apos;t think
ingersol &apos;s gonna show up tomorrow at 10 : 00 .
i know .
cary thinks that they &apos;re trying to avoid
a road bump in their merger .
do you have that other number canning was calling ?
there were three to the ranch
and one to a local number .
yeah .
what &apos;s your thinking ?
i don &apos;t know .
maybe there &apos;s a real emergency .
cary agos .
a fourth @-@ year associate at lockhart / gardner .
and were you asked by mr. hayden for your assistance
over the last three months ?
yes .
and for how many hours a week were you asked to help him ?
roughly ...
ten hours a week .
and this was done on your time ?
as a fourth @-@ year associate ,
very few hours in a day actually constitute my time .
but you managed ?
yes . yes , i did manage .
and what did mr. hayden ask of you ?
he asked me to be his tutor .
his tutor ?
yes .
he asked me to help him study for the upcoming bar exam .
and what prompted that arrangement ?
mr. hayden had attended law school years earlier ,
but never attempted to pass the bar .
now working at lockhart / gardner had reinvigorated him .
and did you feel you had any choice in the matter but to help him ?
no .
thank you , mr. agos .
anything , mr. hayden ?
uh , yes .
uh , you stated that fourth @-@ year associates
rarely have time of their own .
yes .
but you found the time to help me ?
i didn &apos;t feel as if i had a choice .
you held sway over the entire firm .
isn &apos;t it true that i offered to pay you for your assistance ?
yes , you did .
and did you refuse my offer ?
yes .
did i ever state or imply that you would be afforded
preferential treatment for your help ?
no , you did not .
did i ever state or imply
that you would be penalized if you refused to help me ?
no , you did not .
your honor ...
&quot; ma &apos;am . &quot;
ma &apos;am .
lockhart / gardner ...
has no shame
in trying to besmirch my name for their own personal gain .
it goes to their ...
illogical passion for winning at all costs .
once again , i ask that diane lockhart and will gardner
be removed from their managerial positions at the firm .
i &apos;ll take your words under advisement , mr. hayden .
ingersol &apos;s not dodging the depositions
because of the merger .
why then ?
he &apos;s been seeking treatment at an experimental cancer center .
he &apos;s ... since when ?
a few months ago . the number canning
dialed from here was a center run by vivek assadullah ,
a cancer specialist .
ingersol &apos;s battling non @-@ hodgkin lymphoma .
that &apos;s not public knowledge .
no , it &apos;s not .
thanks , kalinda . is alicia there ?
sure . alicia .
yeah ?
use it . they don &apos;t want it to come out before the merger .
i know . i &apos;m on it .
what the hell ?
oh , no . ms. scott @-@ carr , do you have an appointment ?
no . we &apos;re here to confiscate eli gold &apos;s files .
he operated his crisis management firm out of these offices ,
which makes lockhart / gardner
open to investigation as well .
that is bizarrely tenuous .
and yet , supported by the judge .
thank you ...
for the warning shot .
it gave me time to acquire the warrant .
this investigation is so hypocritical .
okay , the files in here first .
don &apos;t worry . he &apos;s coming .
he &apos;s just ... a few minutes late .
o ye of little faith .
good afternoon , mr. ingersol ,
and welcome back .
thank you .
how are you feeling today ?
good . why ?
just a pleasantry .
well ... thank you .
i &apos;m good .
good . why don &apos;t we pick up where we left off .
did you see this letter
that was written by the residents of the community ,
complaining about the state of the five foreclosed homes
and their swimming pools ?
i , uh , did not .
you see it &apos;s addressed to you ?
i do .
if i read every letter addressed to me ,
i wouldn &apos;t have time to ... shave or sleep .
so that answers that , alicia .
any other questions ?
mr. ingersol , are you aware
that it is an sec violation to withhold an illness
from shareholders ?
objection . relevance .
your objection has been noted .
are you aware that it is an sec violation ?
yes , but i &apos;m not sure what this has to do with your lawsuit .
it has to do with your intent to delay , mr. ingersol .
atlantic commerce is a publicly held company .
the shareholders have a right to know if the leader
is facing a critical illness .
and according to his profile ,
dr. vivek assadullah is a specialist
who conducts experimental treatments
for non @-@ hodgkin lymphoma .
objection .
this is beneath you , alicia .
no , unfortunately , it &apos;s not .
the emergency you were dealing with , mr. ingersol , was ...
uh , ms. court reporter ,
do you mind stepping out for a moment , please ?
my name is mika .
so sorry . mika . of course .
you were being treated for non @-@ hodgkin lymphoma ,
and you didn &apos;t want this knowledge made public
before your merger with corsica pacific .
this does not have to go on the record , mr. ingersol .
we have been trying for weeks now
to negotiate with mr. canning .
and if you approve this settlement of $ 15 million ,
the questioning can end right here .
uh , one second , eli .
alicia ?
yes . $ 12 million .
$ 3 million to us .
uh , good . i &apos;ll be right there . yeah .
as i was saying , eli , unfortunately ,
this changes everything .
wendy &apos;s doing this so you can &apos;t be my lawyer .
i know . but now that we &apos;re part of this ...
probe into your practices ,
we are precluded from representing you .
we have a list of potential attorneys .
i &apos;ve called the top three .
all are ready for your call .
and so it goes ,
the endless cycle of chicago investigations .
hey , guys . do you know when the old man is coming back ?
eli . there you are .
let &apos;s talk about debate prep .
let &apos;s . maddie hayward is putting all her time into prep .
that &apos;s when she really wants to make her mark .
and i looked at the schedule , and you ...
you barely have peter down .
we received a settlement offer today for $ 12 million .
and just today , encinal equity
completed their purchase of lockhart / gardner debt .
they are invested in our financial health ,
and we intend to honor that commitment .
mr. hayden ,
i understand your disappointment in losing a merger opportunity ,
but i do believe this purchase of debt suggests
the financial community has faith in management .
therefore , i have determined
ms. lockhart and mr. gardner not
be removed as managing partners
and that they continue to work , with your guidance ,
toward financial health .
after the deadline , five weeks from now ,
mr. hayden , then you might find a merger partner .
that &apos;s my ruling .
escaped the executioner .
for now .
we can never meet a five @-@ week deadline .
i know .
we talk to the new creditor .
get an extension ?
alicia .
i &apos;m so sorry we didn &apos;t get to have that breakfast .
oh , me , too .
you heading out ?
yeah , louis has business , so ...
no rest .
be seeing you soon .
and why &apos;s that ?
oh , you didn &apos;t hear ?
i purchased the lockhart / gardner debt .
i &apos;m your new creditor .
you two will be working together ?
that &apos;s fantastic .
