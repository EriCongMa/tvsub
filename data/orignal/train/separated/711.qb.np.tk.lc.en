meet agent taylor . she &apos;s the f.b.i. liaison
running point on the grayson murder .
ben here knows the case file inside out .
agent taylor has requested that you walk her through the case .
if i wanted to ask emily out , i &apos;d ask her out .
but i feel like you &apos;d have a problem with that .
i &apos;m trying to uncomplicate things with her .
that &apos;s all you had to say .
you guys on a little date ?
what is your problem ?
you &apos;re my problem .
i thought maybe you had changed ,
but i can &apos;t believe i let myself fall in love with you .
louise ellis has a sealed criminal record
that only you can hack into .
you &apos;re coming with us .
don &apos;t hurt her .
i was never here .
i can &apos;t be your father .
why ?
you saw what happened in there . it &apos;s too dangerous .
you have to let me take care of this .
i love you .
start talking .
for the last time , who hired you to attack david clarke ?
screw you . and i mean that as an invitation .
i &apos;m starting to lose my patience .
start talking .
or this gets worse .
officer hunter .
is , uh , is there a problem ?
it &apos;s ben , and no .
i just ... i just wanted to see you
when you weren &apos;t in a moment of crisis or danger .
uh ... it &apos;s -- it &apos;s a little late
for a drop @-@ by , don &apos;t you think ?
come on , i cabbed it all the way from montauk ...
which seemed like a better idea in my head
when i left the bar . um ...
look , it &apos;s after midnight , and --
can i just have two minutes ?
and then i &apos;ll go .
two minutes . cop &apos;s honor .
two minutes .
you know , this part seemed better in my head , too .
there &apos;s just something i &apos;ve been wanting to ask you for a while ,
and i haven &apos;t ... out of respect for ...
screw it . i would love to take you out .
you &apos;re gorgeous .
you &apos;re -- you &apos;re smart . you don &apos;t drive the speed limit ,
which is high on my list , and ...
am i just bombing here ?
ben , um ...
yeah , i &apos;m just ... bombing .
look , i , uh ...
i &apos;m just not ... dating right now , so ...
okay . well , at least i didn &apos;t take up the whole two minutes .
well , good night .
good night .
a @-@ rod is a better player all around , hands down .
come on , maybe , but come on . jeter &apos;s more consistent .
and he &apos;s more respected .
there &apos;s a difference between retiring and getting banned .
let &apos;s agree to disagree .
i agree you &apos;re wrong . this is me .
so , um ...
thanks for helping me close the case today .
i &apos;m sorry it caused tension with your partner .
ah , ben just needs the night to sleep it off .
the conrad grayson case was his baby .
from his seat , he did all the legwork ,
and i ... got the perks .
i &apos;ve never been called a perk .
i doubt that .
anyway , i should , uh ,
i should get going . my son --
is with his nanny .
you already checked in .
i have some ice in my room
in case you have any bruises from that bar fight .
or you can just lie and say you do .
uncle sam ...
always has terrible timing .
agent taylor .
pull all the security tapes . i &apos;ll be right down .
what ?
david clarke was attacked .
let &apos;s go .
yes , sir .
thank you for escorting us home , chief alvarez .
the attack at the hospital was bold ,
and i just wanted to make sure everyone felt safe .
my men will be posted outside tonight .
you &apos;ve always been good to me , edward . thank you .
are you sure you don &apos;t remember anything , victoria ?
maybe something you heard or saw that david didn &apos;t ?
no . i was unconscious the entire time .
mm . i am impressed
that you were able to fend off two assailants by yourself .
well , i was in prison for 10 years .
i know how to fight .
well , we &apos;ll have answers soon .
my men just arrested one of the attackers ,
and hopefully we &apos;ll catch the other one
with the roadblocks .
in the meantime , if there &apos;s anything you need from me ,
i &apos;m just a phone call away .
thank you , edward .
if you know what &apos;s going on ,
you need to tell me right now .
i don &apos;t , but i &apos;m gonna find out .
david , i just want the life we deserve .
... with amanda .
after everything that &apos;s happened the past few days ,
i realized that i can &apos;t hold on to anger anymore .
that &apos;s the life that i want , too , victoria .
we &apos;ll get through this .
new game . same rules .
let &apos;s start with the basics .
crazy bitch !
you have no idea !
who hired you ? what do they want with david clarke ?
i don &apos;t know .
wrong answer .
it was some guy ... with major connections .
he seemed to have the cops in his pocket .
i never met him .
my partner handled it !
who &apos;s your partner ? !
pete !
pete dunn .
we picked him up with david &apos;s picture
and some zip ties . name &apos;s pete dunn .
has he said anything ?
pete &apos;s been quiet ,
but we got him here in the high security room .
limited access .
this guy ...
is scared of something .
give me 10 minutes with him . that something will be me .
we need some help in here !
we need somebody in interrogation , asap !
good morning , lucy .
why , ethel ,
50年代美国情景喜剧 《 我爱露西 》 中的人物
you look like your hangover is as wicked as mine .
leaving a message .
yo , ems .
your security system keeps resetting itself .
i &apos;m sure it &apos;s nothing to worry about .
just some storm damage ,
but with everything that &apos;s going on ,
call me back .
now are you sure you &apos;re not from the south ?
&apos;cause you take care of your friends like family .
well , my friends ... are my family .
cheers .
hair of the dog ?
oh , you are a bad influence , boy .
me ?
i &apos;m sure afternoons at the convent
didn &apos;t earn you the title of the black sheep
of the ellis family .
i bet you were wild .
mm . from the bowels of hell , according to mama .
yeah , she always liked my brother more than me .
called me all sorts of sluts and unstable
before sending me away .
tell you what ...
never forget your first mental institution .
but , i did self @-@ medicate
with my share of hot , nutty boys .
your words . my life .
my father always wrote me letters .
i remember reading about your dad .
he drank himself to death ?
that &apos;s the story we tell .
you know what ?
i think i &apos;m gonna be late for my facial .
will you call me later ?
i take it you heard about your dad .
how &apos;s he doing ?
he &apos;s , uh ... he &apos;s fine .
do you know anything about who attacked him ?
we arrested a guy .
and ?
and ... he committed suicide
in the interrogation room last night .
he hung himself .
seems like that would have made the news by now .
alvarez is clamping down on the media circus around david ,
especially since this doesn &apos;t make us look too good .
are you sure that he killed himself ?
why would you ask that ?
because those guys were thugs for hire ,
not true believers who would commit suicide over a job .
you were there .
i thought things would change .
you were happy to have your dad back .
now you &apos;re doing this again ?
you can &apos;t hide .
alvarez is keeping close tabs ,
and the fbi requested the security tapes .
this investigation will be thorough .
well , i &apos;m thorough , too .
you won &apos;t find anything on those tapes , i promise .
there &apos;s someone i need to talk to .
margaux lemarchal .
oh , guess who just had an interesting chat
with our copperheaded piece of psycho candy .
well , i &apos;m holding five pages for the ellis story .
so what &apos;s the dirt ?
i &apos;m still mid @-@ hack into her sealed criminal records ,
but ... look into her father &apos;s death .
there &apos;s something there .
i will , thank you .
but get into those records or the deal &apos;s off .
i &apos;ll be in touch .
au revoir .
you never have time for breakfast , so ...
did you get my voicemail ?
yeah , i heard it ,
and i still think it &apos;s best if we end things .
i @-@ i know i messed up here , but ...
you swear it won &apos;t happen again .
you &apos;re just like your father and mine .
you do what you please and ask for forgiveness later .
i need a man who doesn &apos;t make rash decisions .
really ?
because you had that with jack porter and you needed more .
we fit , and we &apos;ve been through much worse .
i don &apos;t have the energy for this right now .
please take your breakfast and go .
bye , daniel .
i owe you an apology .
you owe me a reputation ,
cell phone , and about 23,000 twitter followers .
i should &apos;ve , uh , had more faith in you .
i know now that you did what i asked , so thank you .
look , i know that you &apos;re one of amanda &apos;s closest friends .
i am , and she told me everything .
you called me a liar on national tv .
well , the best defense is a good offense , right ?
you were lying about the silo
and about what happened in the hospital the other night .
she fought for you .
and i don &apos;t want her to do it again .
i asked her to leave this alone , but i don &apos;t think she will .
the situation is too dangerous .
which is why you asked her not to reveal her true identity .
it would be like putting a target on her back .
she &apos;s my little girl .
listen , i know that i &apos;m not in a position to ask for a favor .
i will always watch out for emily .
don &apos;t worry .
thank you , nolan .
have you heard from her today ?
well , actually , no .
it &apos;s been ... weirdly quiet .
how weird ?
she told me she would stay out of it ,
so you have to trust her .
she will .
all right . fine .
you know her better than i do .
yep .
better than anybody .
i assume the suffolk county police cruisers downstairs
are with you .
alvarez offered protection after the attack last night .
i &apos;m glad .
are you ?
yes , mom .
i don &apos;t want to see you hurt . all i want is distance .
mm . you were wrong .
i &apos;m not alone . i have david .
even after he reunited with emily .
you keep waiting for blowback , but it hasn &apos;t happened .
not yet .
it won &apos;t .
i know that this started out as revenge ,
but i love david ,
and i will do anything to make him happy ,
even if it means being a doting stepmother .
so what are we talking here ? christmas at the beach house ?
you &apos;ll make the ham ?
if that &apos;s what it takes .
i almost died , daniel .
and i am sick of being miserable .
i want peace and a new life with david .
so that &apos;s why you &apos;re here .
you want me to fall in line to complete your norman rockwell .
i won &apos;t beg , but you are my son ,
and i want you in my life no matter what .
i am telling you right now ,
what you have with david can &apos;t last .
your whole relationship is built on lies .
and trust me , they &apos;ll come out .
he &apos;ll eventually choose emily , and she will destroy you
before she lets you become a part of david &apos;s life .
she all but told me last night .
so you want distance from me , but ...
you &apos;re speaking to emily now ?
well , i have lost everyone ...
patrick , charlotte , you .
but i won &apos;t lose david , too .
found this in my pool house .
where is he , nolan ?
you mean the guy you had strung up
like a roast pig at a luau ?
oh , i set him free .
torture , emily ? really ?
how far were you gonna go ?
you had no right !
my father was attacked twice .
if that thug comes back and hurts him ,
it &apos;s on your hands .
trust me , he won &apos;t .
i &apos;m worried about you , emily , and so is david .
he came by the club today and apologized .
oh , i &apos;m glad your relationship with my father is back on track .
i &apos;m still fighting for mine .
and he &apos;s fighting for you . he &apos;s trying to protect you .
the second attacker was found at the police station hanged .
i believe that someone who had the power to get close
murdered him , someone like alvarez .
we can &apos;t just leave this alone .
i am sorry , ems .
i &apos;m not helping you ,
and neither will anyone else who knows what you &apos;re up to .
you shaved .
yeah . this morning .
i &apos;m ready for a new start .
where were you ?
i went to see daniel . he &apos;s ...
he &apos;s having a hard time accepting us .
and i wanna continue our conversation about amanda .
you haven &apos;t mentioned her since last night .
i &apos;m sure that she heard about the attack .
i &apos;m surprised she hasn &apos;t been by .
i asked her to stay away for a while .
david , was she there during the attack ?
no , she wasn &apos;t there .
you have to leave last night alone .
if that &apos;s what you want .
attackers disabled the cameras .
dead end number two .
i &apos;ve asked the chief to send a few guys over
to interview hospital employees , patients ,
anyone who might &apos;ve seen anything .
ben is itching to help .
great . how about he questions emily thorne ?
you think she &apos;s involved ?
i saw her at the hospital yesterday .
i &apos;ve read up on the grayson family history .
emily and victoria don &apos;t get along .
grudges make you do crazy things .
yeah , well , not that crazy .
besides , i spoke with her when she was here earlier .
she doesn &apos;t know any more than we do .
then i &apos;ll check her off the list .
too bad for ben .
how often do you get to grill a cute blonde ?
thank you .
i was surprised you called .
i didn &apos;t exactly make the best impression last night .
no , no , you were sweet .
i ...
and i &apos;d had a long day , so ...
so let &apos;s start over .
i &apos;m a beer in . i &apos;ve already started over .
i made us reservations
at that new place a couple doors down .
oh , no , no , let &apos;s stay here .
i like low @-@ key . it keeps me honest .
okay .
and i wanted to congratulate you
on solving the conrad grayson murder .
that &apos;s a big deal .
thank you .
yeah , i thought so ,
but chief put jack on the case with the feds .
i &apos;m not dissing my partner ,
but , you know , you &apos;d think alvarez would want someone
with a little more weight on it .
let &apos;s not talk about work .
i wanna learn about the mysterious emily thorne .
well , then i wouldn &apos;t be mysterious .
you really don &apos;t date much , do you ?
you know , conversation , it &apos;s kind of a big part of it .
i tell you what . why don &apos;t we battle it out ?
all right , so high score gets to ask the questions .
i should warn you .
i &apos;m a bit of a dart @-@ throwing king .
bring it .
pretty good .
looks like so far you &apos;re doing all the talking .
those men were in my hospital room , edward .
i &apos;ve been looking over my shoulder all day .
david was the target , not you .
that brings no comfort .
no one will tell me anything .
is there something you can share ?
we &apos;re trying to find a connection
between the attackers
and the man who murdered your ex @-@ husband .
you caught conrad &apos;s killer ?
yeah . his name was vince walsh .
was ?
you mean he &apos;s dead ?
we found him with the murder weapon .
he was the same one who tried to run down david a few weeks ago .
i &apos;m surprised david didn &apos;t mention this to you .
no , he didn &apos;t .
listen ...
maybe you should stay away from david until it &apos;s safe .
i can protect you .
thank you for you honesty , edward .
but i &apos;m where i belong with david .
well , it &apos;s your choice .
i would just hate for you to be
in the wrong place at the wrong time again .
this is victoria .
i need you to find out who hired a local thug .
his name is vince walsh .
hey , lucy .
ready for round two ?
oh . what are we toasting ?
you .
to liars .
now why did lemarchal media call my brother ,
asking about my father ?
i have no idea .
where i &apos;m from , you claim the deer you shot .
now i know you &apos;ve been working with margaux
and digging up dirt on me .
but for the life of me ,
i cannot understand why .
i was real with you .
look , it &apos;s complicated .
look , lemarchal is helping me to save my reputation .
for the price of mine ? and my family &apos;s ?
it has taken me years
of therapy to stop having nightmares about my past ,
and now you &apos;re just gonna destroy that with one story .
you protect your friends like family ?
well , now i know where i stand .
why didn &apos;t you tell me that
the man who tried to run you down
was pinned for conrad &apos;s murder ?
did you plant the knife on him ?
i spoke to chief alvarez .
after i asked you to leave this alone ?
after i asked you to trust me ?
why should i when you insist upon keeping secrets from me ?
oh , that &apos;s pretty ironic coming from you .
you kept my daughter from me for weeks .
i will not explain myself again .
and this is not about amanda , this is about us --
about how you can lie to me , in demand absolute honesty .
why do you ask me to prove myself to you again and again ?
i never asked you to prove anything to me .
you ask me every time you throw my trust issues in my face .
you did it this morning and you did it 20 years ago .
i sat 10 years in jail alone .
what were you proving then ?
or did you not know that i was innocent ?
of course i knew .
where the hell were you ?
september 1st , 1993 .
that date is etched in my memory .
i said it over and over ,
even after it passed and you were in prison .
it was the day that we were supposed to leave
with amanda and daniel and start our new life .
do you remember ?
yes .
i never forgot it .
i said it every time
i had to climb into bed with a man i hated ,
every time i looked into charlotte &apos;s eyes
and saw yours .
i never stopped trusting you , david .
and i would go with you tonight , now , if you would just ask .
just ask .
i &apos;m not going anywhere without my daughter .
i need some air .
8 ball corner pocket .
mercy .
i don &apos;t believe in mercy .
you remind me of my ex @-@ wife .
you know , she never let me win at anything either .
i didn &apos;t know you were married .
yep .
yeah , we were way too young .
i thought she was the only person in the world
that got me , you know ?
turns out she was just using me to deal with her past .
one day , i woke up . she was just gone .
guess i &apos;d served my purpose .
how &apos;d you do it ?
move on ?
i buried myself in work ,
graduated top of my rookie class .
and you said that , um , that alvarez helped you ?
yeah . yeah , back in jersey .
i first applied in essex county .
alvarez was a beat cop over there .
he used to mentor us probies and some wayward kids .
so why did he leave essex ?
alvarez won &apos;t spill , but
there was some suspicion about the way he handled a case .
he &apos;s come a long way since then .
he &apos;s practically hamptons elite .
ton of connections . a very powerful man .
so when &apos;s your deadline ?
on this expose that you &apos;re writing on alvarez ?
i &apos;m not writing anything . i &apos;m ...
i &apos;m just curious .
me , too .
sorry .
something tells me that this isn &apos;t a date .
ben ...
you know what ? i &apos;m ...
i &apos;m gonna take care of the bar tab .
i think we should call it a night .
what did that thing do to you ?
it ate my dollar and kept my carbs .
can you bump this machine and get us a new lead
on the david clarke case ? we &apos;re stuck .
maybe we missed something .
whoever &apos;s behind the attacks is cleaning up as they go .
what do you mean ?
i read the medical examiner &apos;s report .
there were scratches on his neck
that are consistent with self @-@ defense .
but more consistent with having
second thoughts . page 3 .
i considered the same thing ,
but the m.e. &apos; s report is conclusive .
it was a theory .
and a good one , but still a dead end ,
which is why i &apos;m getting called back to washington .
there &apos;s nothing here to warrant a continued federal presence .
you &apos;re leaving ?
i &apos;m booked on a flight in the morning ,
which means that the ice in my hotel room &apos;s
gonna go to waste ,
unless you have that drink with me .
seemed like a good idea last night , but i ...
i gotta finish up around here .
yeah , i &apos;ve been watching you these past couple days ...
always so measured and careful ,
concerned about your partner , your friends .
and that &apos;s great .
but what about you ?
where &apos;s that guy that wanted to sail off to haiti and take a risk ?
you know , work will be here in the morning , but i won &apos;t .
come on .
conrad doesn &apos;t know that i took $ 5 million out of our account .
well , he will , but we &apos;ll be gone by then .
when do you want to go ?
september 1st ?
that &apos;s when conrad returns to the city .
you &apos;re not gonna back out , are you ?
no . you have to trust me .
i know you have a hard time with that .
david !
no , that &apos;s why i want you to keep the safe .
choose the passcode and hide it somewhere .
no . if this is going to work , we have to trust each other .
i &apos;ll choose the code , and you hide the safe .
and when the time &apos;s right ,
we &apos;ll open it together and only together .
together .
what ?
september 1st , 1993 .
david .
i &apos;m heading out of town .
if i don &apos;t come back , there &apos;s a safe .
i need you to make sure that
the contents get sent to every news outlet in america .
here &apos;s the location and the key code .
what is going on ?
david , if you really wanna earn my trust back ,
tell me .
the guy coming after me is malcolm black .
he ran an illegal arms operation off a compound in canada .
so ... that &apos;s where you were the last 10 years ?
malcolm smuggled me up there after i was stabbed .
he forced me to launder money or he would kill amanda .
when i fled , i took evidence to protect myself .
and now i have to find him to let him know that .
okay , scale of 1 to 10 ...
how dangerous is this guy ?
i don &apos;t really have a choice .
but maybe you do .
you were right about emily .
when it comes to you , she can &apos;t stay out of it .
she kind of hog @-@ tied and tortured
the second guy who attacked you .
i sedated him and set him free ,
but i also made sure that if he found his way back ,
i &apos;d find him first .
i , uh , i developed a tracker
you can hide anywhere ,
even in a glass of water .
nanotech is the new black .
yeah , see ?
guy &apos;s in newark .
you can borrow my helicopter if you want .
pilot can meet you in 20 minutes .
you &apos;re a good friend , nolan .
for a guy that ...
doesn &apos;t have many friends ,
i try not to take any for granted .
is , uh , nolan in his office yet ?
no , but he said he &apos;d be back
by last call to sign off on payroll .
thanks .
what are you doing here ?
trying to woo back a old client .
but since he &apos;s not around ,
i &apos;m just here drinking to my sad life .
and to our parents ,
who i &apos;m starting to believe are actually in love .
go away , daniel .
oh , you look good .
you out on a date ?
want me to call the poor guy and read him his last rights ?
you know , i &apos;m really not in the mood to be doing
whatever this is we &apos;ve been doing lately , so ...
oh , what ? having honest conversations ,
probably for the first time ever ?
yeah , that sucks .
you know , i &apos;m starting to realize why we didn &apos;t work .
we &apos;re the same person .
yeah , we &apos;re stubborn as hell ,
and we use people without giving a damn
about who gets hurt in the process .
that is not who i am .
oh , but it is .
i see you , emily .
i see you .
so tell me ,
who are you hurting these days ?
oh , wait . i &apos;ll go first .
margaux , the best woman i &apos;ve been with in years --
no offense --
wants nothing more to do with me
because i &apos;m an ass .
well , we &apos;re not friends , daniel ,
so i &apos;m not gonna prop you up
and go tell you to go fight for margaux .
you don &apos;t fight for anything .
ouch .
yeah .
well , i see you , too .
hey , em .
you really do look pretty tonight .
and i think that means you &apos;re up to something .
i just hope the guy isn &apos;t wearing his heart on his sleeve .
because trust me ,
you &apos;ll use it .
flight number 230 with service to philadelphia ...
i need you to get a message to malcolm black .
never heard of him .
really ?
you were doing his dirty work last night when you attacked me .
find a way to get this to him
or i &apos;ll keep finding you .
who hired vince walsh ?
word is a psychopath named malcolm black .
he doesn &apos;t live in the states ,
but he has someone local with juice to hire the muscle .
and why does he want david dead ?
the order was to deliver him unharmed .
apparently , he worked for malcolm a couple of years ago .
david owes him a lot of money .
a couple of years ago ?
i won &apos;t let anybody hurt david .
and if it &apos;s money this malcolm wants ,
there is another solution .
i trust that you &apos;ll get that in the right hands
and keep mine clean .
shouldn &apos;t be a problem .
i &apos;m getting impatient , nolan . we have a deadline .
were you able to get into her records ?
i was , but ...
you won &apos;t .
one of your reporters called louise &apos;s brother
and she is totally freaked out
and scared , so i &apos;m out .
are you feeling guilty ?
nolan , i can &apos;t conduct business
based on which way your conscience is leaning .
you know , as crazy as louise may be ,
i &apos;m not gonna help you do to her
what you did to me with david clarke .
and without the facts ,
well , you have to kill the story .
well , then our deal to fix your rep is over .
turns out i only care what my friends think about me ,
and i &apos;m in the process of figuring out who they are .
editorial .
run the ellis story tonight .
if there &apos;s a complaint ,
that &apos;s what retractions are for , know ?
somebody told me that i don &apos;t fight for anything .
i love you ,
and there &apos;s nothing you can say
or tell me that you don &apos;t love me , too .
so you showed up drunk to fight .
but i showed up .
bravo .
bravo as long as you do the bare minimum .
what &apos;s that supposed to mean ?
you . this .
you showed up here without giving a damn about me .
i asked you to stay away .
this is me trying .
i &apos;m not -- i &apos;m not leaving .
i &apos;m not doing this with you !
i have way too much on my plate right now !
no , will you stop thinking about your company for one minute ?
i messed up , but i &apos;m not like your father ,
and i &apos;m not gonna let you push me away
because of how screwed up our families were .
not were , daniel . are .
we &apos;re both screwed up because of our families .
and i &apos;m not going to make the same mistake . this is over !
why do you get to decide that ?
i &apos;m calling security .
i deserve a better answer .
why ?
because i &apos;m pregnant .
how was your drive ?
i &apos;m sorry for walking out on you , but you &apos;re right .
i can &apos;t ask you to stand by my side
and keep secrets from you .
then tell me what you can .
how about i start with where i &apos;ve been the last 10 years ?
i knew there was more to the story .
you weren &apos;t in that silo , were you ?
no .
there &apos;s a man .
he &apos;s more dangerous than conrad .
did i forget to tip the bartender ?
you were right .
that wasn &apos;t a date .
no kidding .
i wanted information on alvarez ,
and i used your interest in me to get it .
okay , well , i gotta say that makes me feel a little better .
most women don &apos;t bear trap my wrist when i touch &apos; em .
i had someone , too ,
and i lost him .
i &apos;m sorry to hear that .
i just wrote off our flame out
as you never letting a guy win at anything .
i mean , darts , pool .
what are you not good at ?
dating .
yeah ? yeah , well , that &apos;s clear after tonight .
and i still owe you one .
so how about we get the interview out of the way
before that date ?
&apos;cause i &apos;d rather leave alvarez home next time .
so ...
what do you want to know ?
i &apos;m looking into the attack on david clarke .
one of the attackers was
arrested and taken to your precinct .
yeah . i know . the guy killed himself .
you don &apos;t think that he did .
i think someone killed him .
i think someone who had access to him ,
someone who &apos;s working for the people who are after david clarke .
what is it with you and david clarke ?
his daughter means a lot to both of us , so ...
he means a lot to me .
and if alvarez is working for
the people who are trying to hurt him -- - hold on .
whatever it is that &apos;s going on here ,
i can assure you alvarez has nothing to do with it .
he &apos;s not dirty .
he &apos;s the only person with power and the access to cover it up .
yeah , but not the opportunity .
i ran into him when i left your house last night .
he was coming from david &apos;s beach house .
he gave me a ride home .
at the same time , pete dunn was being transferred from holding .
it was someone else .
except that it &apos;s not .
the guy was in a high security interrogation room .
all right , no one else had access to that room
except alvarez and the feds .
leave it on the desk , please .
yes , ma &apos;am . have a good night .
