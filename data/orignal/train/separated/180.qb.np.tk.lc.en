gossip here .
your one and only source
into the scandalous lives of manhattan &apos;s elite .
why settle for some clubs in a hotel
when you can just buy the hotel ?
i &apos;m maureen .
politics is a van der bilt birth right .
the only thing nate &apos;s ever voted for is
&quot; american idol . &quot;
tripp is the same way .
grandfather can be very persuasive .
when did tripp decide to run for congress ?
well , after congressman krugar die ,
a house seat opened up in manhattan .
dan , i have to tell you something
oh , olivia !
oh , my god . are you ... you &apos;re not ...
fleur . i lied because i ...
i care about you .
the only person i want to kiss here tonight is you .
why would you leak a fake photo ?
are you trying to destroy tripp &apos;s campaign ?
that &apos;s gonna win tripp the election
and what happens to carter ?
i am sorry i had to lie to you .
no , you &apos;re not .
i settled your debt with the buckleys .
nate probably hates me now , but it doesn &apos;t matter .
i &apos;m sorry , s. ,
but chuck &apos;s hotel needed this .
without your celebrities ,
we &apos;re buried in the city section .
now we &apos;re front page news .
you got my clients photographed
to the hottest party of the year . your job is safe .
and , serena , that job
now includes publicly dating patrick .
i don &apos;t know if i &apos;d call that work
get back to me after date two .
in manhattan , some parties are v.i.p. only .
others are strictly private .
but some parties are political ,
and those lines are drawn
by the most established of the establishment .
hey . you want to use that ?
and once those lines are drawn ,
they can never be crossed .
a michael mann political thriller ?
that &apos;s good news ..
wonderful news . and my source tells me
michael &apos;s only considering two actors for the lead .
patrick and ryan phillippe .
well , then he &apos;s in .
ryan totally lost his mojo after reese got with jake .
don &apos;t &quot; jake &quot; me , serena .
your job is to get patrick &apos;s photo taken with politicians
at the van der bilt election party tonight .
but , k.c.i can &apos;t
the producers will eat it up .
plus , it &apos;ll totally help him
get into character for his audition next week .
so i look forward to hearing how it goes .
wait , k.c. , the problem is
i &apos;m kind of on the outs with the van der bilts right now .
serena , what &apos;s p.r. rule number one ?
my only value is my social network .
but i &apos;m afraid that network is currently one archibald short .
make it happen .
clean up your mess ,
or clean out your desk .
no , that one .
hey . how long you been awake ?
mm . not long .
remind me to send the
van der bilt campaign a muffin basket .
vanessa &apos;s been completely m.i.a.
since she started shooting that documentary .
she was here for , like , ten seconds yesterday ,
and i guess she &apos;s getting amazing footage .
the only footage i want to see is
your jimmy kimmel appearance
i mean , dinner was great last night .
i just wish we &apos;d gotten back in time to see it .
yeah . sorry i ...
i dragged you to that gelato shop .
i had a really bad sugar craving .
you know what ? i bet it &apos;s online .
no . uh , you can &apos;t watch it like that .
the ... the quality &apos;s so bad , you know ?
i &apos;d rather you watch it in hd okay .
when ? i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m just excited .
it &apos;s been a while since i had
a girlfriend on a late night talk show .
um , well , i &apos;m ... i &apos;m sure i can get a copy from k.c.
okay .
ho ho ! watch out . it &apos;s bathroom boy . clear the way .
uh , good morning to you , too .
welcome to my new suite .
we may patent the media system
interactive , high @-@ def 3 @-@ d gaming .
instant access to the world &apos;s largest media library
and all in @-@ house food , spa services .
just touch the button .
blair &apos;s favorite part ...
real @-@ time surveillance playback . it &apos;s naughty .
well , it certainly is a step up from the columbia dorms .
most penthouses are , nathaniel .
there &apos;s two bedrooms . feel free to crash any time you like .
tripp , maureen .
hey , chuck .
hey . all this behind @-@ the @-@ scenes stuff is really great .
thanks again for letting me film tripp &apos;s campaign .
oh , no problem .
charles . well , you &apos;ve outdone yourself .
my pleasure , sir .
i can &apos;t think of a better way to christen the ballroom
than with a van der bilt victory party .
your generosity will not be forgotten by me or my family
we &apos;re very much looking forward to tonight &apos;s event .
thanks again , chuck . even if the night ends in defeat
at least we &apos;ll have a good party .
sweetie ... don &apos;t talk like that
this morning &apos;s polling numbers aren &apos;t great .
we &apos;re down where we should be up ,
and where we are up , we &apos;re barely hanging on .
that &apos;s what makes it exiting , right ?
excuse me .
he &apos;s right , nnathaniel .
things aren &apos;t where they should be .
the buckleys &apos; dirty pool is starting to work .
thanks to serena , we weren &apos;t able to expose it .
well , isn &apos;t there something we can do ?
it &apos;s election day . at this point , nathaniel ,
it would take nothing short of a miracle .
hey . i was running errands ,
and k.c. asked me to drop off your jimmy fallon interview .
great . i guess that means you &apos;ve seen it .
yeah .
you know i didn &apos;t mean what i said .
oh , don &apos;t--don &apos;t worry about that .
i &apos;m sure dan understands .
he hasn &apos;t even seen it . i don &apos;t know what to do .
i have to fix this ,
and meanwhile , keep him away from tv and the internet
and strangers with the urge to make fun of him .
don &apos;t forget about gossip girl
i have to just keep him completely isolated .
oh , hey . what are you doing here .
um ...
serena just , uh , came by
to tell us how much she likes patrick .
oh .
yeah . uh , oddly , he &apos;s my favorite part of my job .
it &apos;s actually pretty fun having a fake relationship .
talk about no pressure .
i &apos;m slightly relieved .
i heard some pretty crazy stuff
about patrick after we broke up
supposedly he went a bit method
after that gus van sant movie he did nobody saw .
yeah . his agent and k.c.
are filtering all the scripts that get to him .
so far , he &apos;s only been allowed to read a political thriller .
what &apos;s the worst thing he can do , pass a bill ?
listen , as much as i enjoy my cuurent girlfriend talking
to my ex @-@ girlfriend about her fake boyfriend
who is also my current girlfriend &apos;s ex ,
uh , you--you--you could probably get us
a copy of that fallon interview , right ?
but first you should probably get to patrick &apos;s
before fedex does with more scripts .
good @-@ bye .
okay . bye .
s. i hope you &apos;re not here looking for an apology .
no , i was just dropping something off to olivia .
oh , that &apos;s right . i momentarily forgot your job
is more important than your friends .
i have a couple minutes . do you want to get a latte ?
if by &quot; getting a latte &quot; you mean apologizing , the no , i don &apos;t
out of respect for our many years of friendship ,
i &apos;m willing to let what you did slide .
what i did ?
okay , we both made decisions that hurt the other .
we both feel badly . now let &apos;s move on .
i actually have to go meet chuck right now .
we &apos;ve been going nonstop , preparing
for tripp van der bilt &apos;s election party tonight .
speaking of which , i noticed you &apos;re not on the guest list .
that can only mean one thing--
nate still hates you for whatever it is you did to him .
i &apos;d check your sources , b
and i am going tonight , with my
handsome boyfriend , patrick .
since your boyfriend &apos;s working the party ,
who are you going with , one of your knockoffs ?
since you &apos;re so interested , i have made real friends here .
i just don &apos;t share your need to brag .
okay .
well , i can &apos;t wait to meet them tonight .
i need a friend . stat .
i &apos;m your friend .
please .
i &apos;m not friends with staff .
you need to get that ?
no , it &apos;s not important .
this is nate . leave a message .
i &apos;m just saying , if this morning &apos;s polls
put you neck and neck with sullivan ,
then there &apos;s still time , so why not let grandfather help you
nate , i &apos;ve said it before , and i &apos;ll say it again--
i &apos;d rather lose fair and square
than win with a dirty compaign
yeah , well , asking grandfather for help
doesn &apos;t necessarily mean playing dirty .
so it &apos;s election day. who are you voting for ?
hey ! someone &apos;s drowning over here ! call 9 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 !
help ! i can &apos;t swim !
help ! i &apos;m drowning !
it look like tripp &apos;s prayers have been answered
with another miracle on the hudson .
are the van ber bilts blessed with
good luck or good timing ?
you &apos;re watching new york 1-- news all day .
just this morning ,
congressional candidate tripp van ber bilt
rescued a man who was drowning in the hudson river .
one minute i &apos;m walking along the pier ,
and the next thing i know i lose my balance ,
and boom ! i &apos;m in the hudson . if it wasn &apos;t
for this brave young man , tripp van der bilt ...
apparently van der bilt
ten hours till the polls close .
let &apos;s seize the day , gentleman .
where are we with media ?
i &apos;ve locked down coverage from every local station
for the midday news .
time to call couric .
she owes me a favor .
maybe she can squeeze tripp into the evening news .
excuse me , grandfather . can i speak with you for a moment ?
zogby has them neck and neck .
rasmussen puts him up by a point .
tripp , that &apos;s fantastic .
remember , until the polls close ,
any time someone mentions
the name tripp van der bilt ,
it should be followed by the word &quot; hero . &quot;
well , i guess miracles do happen ,
huh , grandfather ?
our family is really blessed .
so is that man who almost died .
william , can you take a look at this ?
absolutely . no , thank you . thank you so , so much .
hey . my rescue footage is gonna be on the news tonight .
william told me to go out and drum up some interest ,
and it looks like i &apos;m the only one who got it all on tape .
congratulations.have you seen nate ?
yeah . he &apos;s over there . tell him bye for me .
i &apos;ve gotta go home and get my tapes together .
okay .
what are you doing here ?
i @-@ i left you a message .
y @-@ you never call me back .
yeah , well , as you can see , i &apos;ve been sort of busy .
and i really have nothing to say to you .
then i &apos;ll make it quick . i need you to put me
and patrick roberts on the guest list for tripp &apos;s party tonight .
what ? are you kidding me ?
nate , my job is at stake .
oh , that &apos;s funny .
so is my cousin &apos;s campaign , thanks to you .
as far as i &apos;m concerned , we are even .
you used me for your buckley photo scam .
all i did was find out and undo it .
well , i wouldn &apos;t exactly call revenge .
a solid foundation for a friendship .
who said anything about friendship ?
all i need is an invite , plus one .
serena . tripp , hey . i @-@ i voted for you .
thanks . you coming tonight ?
absolutely . i wouldn &apos;t miss it .
thanks , nate .
tripp , can i get you to sign off on this ?
washington square park , bobst library , bar none .
i even tried spinning the cube in st. mark &apos;s place ,
but not a friend in sight .
i just know this wouldn &apos;t be so hard at yale .
what about vanessa girl ?
didn &apos;t you know her in high school ?
i have never heard that name before in my life .
now feel free to see yourself out .
oh , my god .
how does that girl have the valentino 360 bag ?
i &apos;m still wait @-@ listed .
who ? where ?
at the register .
quick . how do i look ?
superior .
no one follow me .
i love your 360 .
thanks . i just got it .
very smart to pair it with peter som .
you &apos;re good .
i know . i &apos;m blair . may i ?
oh , please . do .
the moment i saw it ,
it joined my list of blair &apos;s most wanted .
believe me when i tell you
i don &apos;t say this very often--
but i think i like you .
well , give me those peep toes and maybe i &apos;ll believe you .
sorry . my alexandre birmans are sacred .
amen .
by the way , i &apos;m brandeis .
how would you like to come with
me to a fabulous party tonight ?
&quot; mat . &quot; are you joking ?
oh , not in the least .
it &apos;s going on the end of &quot; door . &quot;
which makes it a triple word score , scrabble bitches .
that &apos;s my son .
wow . the humphreys are--are so serious
about their scrabble games .
oh , yeah .
mm @-@ hmm . you two are so sweet to
come over and entertain jenny 。
poor thing . well , she &apos;s been cooped up with this virus for a week .
i mean , when she called , how could we resist ?
yeah . th @-@ thank you guys so much .
really getting sick of , uh , tv and internet .
oh , i need a s.a.r.s. mask .
um , can i-- can i borrow your phone ?
yeah , go ahead .
i keep leaving mine in the dorm .
that &apos;s 33 .
a whopping 33 points .
&quot; jetdoorman &quot; -- is that a word ?
don &apos;t you mean &quot; jetdoormat &quot; ?
oh , jetdoormat . s.a.r.s. mask !
so it &apos;s election day . who are you voting for ?
i don &apos;t know . that &apos;s a really tough question .
you know , i &apos;m not really
sure who i &apos;m gonna vote for . he &apos;s awfully young .
you know , i &apos;m not really--
what ?
... sure who i &apos;m gonna vote for . he &apos;s awfully young .
wow . you look hot .
same . i have great news .
yeah . so do i.
you first .
i just finished reading a fantastic script .
the political thriller ?
no ,
it &apos;s a remake of &quot; leaving las vegas &quot;
they want to redo it with a younger cast .
where did you get the script ?
in the garbage . i &apos;m telling you , this one &apos;s amazing .
care to join me in a little research ?
no . no research .
your team has been pushing very hard for the political one .
and i have worked my butt off to
get you into this party tonight .
yeah , but miley cyrus is already signed on
to play the elisabeth shue role .
they must &apos;ve seen her on that pole at the t.c.a.s.
okay , we don &apos;t have time to talk about this .
you need to get ready .
this party is a very big deal for both of us .
there will be tons of important political people .
forget vegas . it &apos;s all about d.c. , okay ?
put on some clothes , please .
hey , vanessa .
listen , i &apos;m really busy . uh , this couldn &apos;t wait ?
honestly , no .
and i thought it &apos;d be better
to talk away from the campaign chaos .
mm . i &apos;m in a really awkward position ,
so i &apos;m just gonna say what i have to say .
okay .
what happened at the hudson this morning
wasn &apos;t what it looked like .
what do you mean ?
the guy you and tripp saved ,
he didn &apos;t fall .
i think it , i think it was set up .
that &apos;s ridiculous .
i have it all on tape .
well , has anyone else seen the footage ?
no , but i already agreed to sell it to new york 1,
and i &apos;m going to meet caroline lowe ,
one of the producers , at cafeteria .
wait . vanessa , if you do that , then ...
nate , i &apos;m sorry ,
but if i just sit on it , i become part of a cover @-@ up .
listen , the polls close in a few hours .
can you just , can you just wait ?
i wish i could ,
but this is not some high school thing
with blair and the mean girls .
this is someone running for public office , nate . yeah ,
yeah . but there &apos;s gotta be some sort of explanation .
someone set tripp up to look like a hero ,
and i think we both know the person most likely
to orchestrate something like that is your grandfather .
i have so much respect for tripp ,
and he has been so generous to let me film his campaign .
should i warn him so he can prepare a strategy
for damage control ?
don &apos;t worry about telling tripp .
okay ? i &apos;ll tell him .
i &apos;m sorry , nate .
no .
this election may be too close to call ,
but when it &apos;s his family &apos;s honor or his own ,
nate archibald has the number on speed dial .
yes , uh , new york 1 , please .
caroline lowe .
wow . thank you so much for explaining that .
hey , we were just discussing
the senate committee on appropriations .
maybe you &apos;d like to join us . oh , my god . hello .
thank you so much .
see ? isn &apos;t this great ?
you &apos;ve got the perfect capitol hill vibe .
i gotta hit the can .
okay .
he &apos;s great .
do you wanna ...
oh , my god . that &apos;s senator proctor .
wow . you really do know everyone .
oh , i don &apos;t know everyone . i &apos;ll be right back .
hey , blair .
hey . do you see that
gorgeous blonde in proenza schouler
talking to those high @-@ profile politicians ?
that &apos;s my best friend brandeis .
she knows most of them personally .
oh , that &apos;s great . i mean , political connections
aren &apos;t the first thing most people look for in friends
they must really love her ,
because when she introduced us ,
they seemed thrilled to meet me
they even asked if we were sisters .
well , i can &apos;t wait for you to meet patrick
he &apos;s over at the bar , getting me a drink right now .
i feel so lucky . he &apos;s so attentive .
it doesn &apos;t take much , doesn &apos;t it ?
what ? no one &apos;s ever accused you of saying no .
hey , where is the scrabble dictionary ?
i could swear &quot; squiffy &quot; is a word .
oh . scrabble dictionary .
bathroom boy ?
all right , you know our next guest
from the &quot; endless knights &quot; movie franchise
please welcome the lovely olivia burke , everybody !
she &apos;s cute .
... served four years on city council .
and ten in the state legislature .
he was a supporter of john mccain ,
stumping for him all across rural upstate new york
in the 2008 presidential race .
someone just told me you &apos;re vanessa abrams . is that right ?
yeah .
so who did you end up selling the footage to ?
my office just called , said that you sold
your rescue footage to another network .
yeah , i sold it to new york 1 actually .
a woman named caroline lowe .
i met her two hours ago .
i &apos;m caroline lowe .
so who was the woman in the restaurant ?
finally . it &apos;s your turn .
oh , you know what ? i just realized i have
an , uh , environmental studies paper due tomorrow .
oh , wait . um , i &apos;ll just get my stuff .
no , you know what ? stay . you &apos;re winning ,
and you gotta keep jenny company .
i &apos;ll text you later , okay ?
did my son just walk out
before playing a &quot; q &quot; on a double letter ?
that is so not the humphrey way .
my computer .
hmm . hmm .
you know , i am sensing something else is going on here .
well , you didn &apos;t actually think they wanted
to play five hours worth of board games with us , did you ?
mm .
looking for your boyfriend ?
uh , no . he &apos;s probably getting mobbed by fans right now .
he &apos;s just still on the way to get us a drink .
because he downed both your drinks
and then ordered two more , for himself .
where is he ?
don &apos;t worry . i took care of it .
where is he ?
don &apos;t worry . i took care of it .
i had him taken up to his suite .
what ? why ?
he &apos;s bombed .
he &apos;s drunker than paula abdul during hollywood week .
are you really that jealous that he &apos;s here with me ?
look s . you know baiz better than most of us .
having been in that state so many times yourself .
i guess you just met your match .
but since i just found out that your date is really work
you may want to play closer attention to him next time .
this is nate &apos;s big night at chuck &apos;s hotel
so sorry s . i did what i had to do again .
so you &apos;re out with this guy
and he goes to the bathroom
he comes back
well , it was-- it was our first date
and he goes to the restroom and when he comes back
his--his shirt was on inside out .
uh uh check please .
no .
that &apos;s where you go right there .
i &apos;ve said when he get out . that &apos;s when you have to leave
no . i find out later that on the way back
into the bathroom he &apos;s walked into a spider web .
and the spider crawled inside his shirt .
yeah , the old spider excuse we &apos;ve all used that one before .
yeah &quot; oh , a spider came down on my shirt &quot;
and that &apos;s why i had to take my shirt off and
okay , yeah , i believe that . i would believe that one .
and--and now are you still dating bathroom boy or
or are--was he arrested ? i don &apos;t know .
tomorrow is our one month anniversary .
aw ! my gosh . well , congratulations .
in--in honor i &apos;m taking my clothing off
in the bathroom and then redressing myself .
wow . and after all that scrabble
i can &apos;t believe i told that story on national television
he must hate me .
please pick up. please pick up. please pick up .
it went to voice mail .
hey . um . it &apos;s me .
i know that you &apos;re not picking up
because you must be so mad at me .
please know that i &apos;m so so sorry .
patrick .
patrick .
patrick !
patrick. what are you doing ?
i told you how important tonight was .
you think blair had me thrown out
because i was a little tipsy or because i was talking
to that high @-@ priced hot girl friend of hers ?
what did you just say ?
why &apos;d you do it ?
do what ?
come on nate.you &apos;re the only one
who knew i &apos;d a meeting to sell that footage .
i had to protect tripp
i came to you first as a friend .
don &apos;t be so selfish .
you were only selling the footage to further your own career .
that is not true .
oh so you &apos;re saying you weren &apos;t excited to see your name
flash on every television in manhattan ?
you know what nate ?
i &apos;ll let you know how that feel in just a minute .
what does that mean ?
hey . hey , everybody , quiet down for a second .
we are just now getting reports that firsthand footage
of the hudson river rescue reveals tripp van der bilt &apos;s
heroic act might not have been so heroic .
it seems after close inspection of the footage
taken at the time . it &apos;s apparent that
the man deliberately went into the hudson river
the polls are closed
and gossip girl is calling this election dirty .
it remains to be seen
who exactly is responsible for this hoax .
someone in the van der bilt camp ?
maybe the candidate himself ?
by news of this breaking clue &apos;s
effect that will have on the polls
is impossible to measure .
all right.could someone just turn that off
and please just give us a moment of privacy . thank you .
i can &apos;t believe
you would compromise my integrity like this
you didn &apos;t believe i could actually win , did you ?
honestly i had my doubts
but i did not do this .
the hell you didn &apos;t .
tripp , just calm down .
listen to me very carefully , grandfather .
if you don &apos;t go out there and take responsibility for this
then i will--
by stepping out of the race .
i &apos;m not going in front of those cameras and lie
oh come on grandfather. it &apos;s time to come clean .
i give you my word . i &apos;m not responsible for this .
unfortunately for the both of us
your word means nothing anymore .
well.if you are both done
i &apos;m going to go down and join the celebration .
gather the press nate .
i &apos;m going to announce my official withdrawal .
i just have to tell maureen first .
i know i &apos;m an enemy of the state right now .
the guy i used to call my friend
had a moral compass .
well , right now i &apos;m thinking i &apos;m
just gonna go for my master
but who knows ?
sorry to interrupt . brandeis , right ? i &apos;m serena .
hi , serena . this is congressman wade .
pleasure to meet you .
and are you a , uh , student , like brandeis ?
no , i &apos;m just a regular old working girl .
really ? and--and do you two work together ?
because maybe the three of us ...
congressman , you &apos;ve been campaigning a little too hard .
let me guess-- you want to go upstairs
and see if two blondes make a right ?
uh , excuse us .
i &apos;m sorry .
i thought i was working this party alone .
did the agency send you ?
no , you &apos;re right . this party is all yours .
excuse me .
as a friend of the family , what do you have to say
about the allegation
that tripp van der bilt &apos;s heroism might have been staged ?
uh , i say i &apos;m a businessman , not a politician .
how would it affect your business
if the empire &apos;s inaugural event is mired in scandal ?
look , you think anyone goes to the mercer for the main service
they go &apos; cause they want to see russell crowe throw a hissy .
anyway , nothing happens at the empire without my say @-@ so .
what are you doing , blair ? looking for your best friend ?
bad news . security just escorted her out
in time to avoid a major political scandal .
you &apos;re kidding me . now we &apos;re doing tit for tat ?
she was an escort , a high @-@ priced hooker .
you &apos;re ridiculous .
brandeis is not a call girl . she &apos;s a psych major .
who on earth told you that ?
patrick .
the guy is wasted . he thought chuck schumer was his father .
you &apos;re just trying to get back at me .
no , actually ,
i &apos;m just looking out for chuck and nate
i doubt chuck would want a prostitute at his hotel ,
especially at this party .
you don &apos;t get it .
patrick was about to cause a cause a scene .
i was protecting everyone ,
including you .
what are you talking about ?
look , ladies , please .
this is supposed to be a classy event ,
not a sample sale at an outlet mall .
chuck , you &apos;ll never believe what serena did
she had my friend kicked out of the party .
the call girl ?
security just told me .
w--no , no . i promise you , brandeis is not an escort .
serena &apos;s just trying to get even with me .
look , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on here ,
but if the girl &apos;s still here , i &apos;ll find her
and get to the bottom of it , okay ?
thank you , chuck .
and who &apos;s the one getting paid to date her clients anyway ?
that &apos;s enough , blair .
no. if it walks
like a duck and talks like a duck
the only prostitute here ... is you .
come on , chuck .
i want some cake .
blair and serena at war again .
yummy .
hey . let me go first .
nate , it &apos;s okay . i know what i &apos;m doing .
excuse me .
excuse me .
hi .
my name is nate archibald .
i &apos;m tripp van der bilt &apos;s cousin .
and i know there &apos;s a lot of buzz going around
about what exactly happened this morning at the hudson river .
and it saddens me to tell you all
that the story about it being a hoax--
it is true .
however , my cousin , tripp van der bilt ,
had no knowledge of any kind of setup .
my cousin is not only the most moral ,
honest ...
and courageous guy i know ...
he &apos;s still a hero .
and how do i know this ?
because i &apos;m the one who set it up .
what the hell is wrong with you ?
right now , first , i need to drink .
she called me a prostitute .
yeah. why do you think she did that ?
i &apos;m not sleeping with patrick ,
you , of all people , know what a prostitute does .
the reason blair attacked you because she is mad at you
don &apos;t tell me after 18 years , you can &apos;t read waldorf subtext .
i shouldn &apos;t have to
if that &apos;s what she &apos;s feeling , then she should tell me .
it is time for her to grow up .
this coming from someone
who just pushed their best friend into a cake .
look , you think your friendship
is going to take care of itself
you &apos;re not kids anymore . you can &apos;t say you hate each other
then make up an hour later on the met steps .
you tell her that .
i &apos;m telling you .
and you should be careful , because one day you &apos;re
gonna find yourself telling people about blair waldorf ,
the girl who used to be your best friend .
hi . i got your text .
yeah . all it said was-- &quot; maybe we should talk &quot; --
and so i just came right away .
i &apos;m sorry about fallon .
up till now , my publicist would decide everything for me--
what i &apos;d talk about during interviews
and even script exactly what i would say .
and just this one time , i wanted to just ... be myself
and--and go out there and be me , and i ... i bombed .
what ? no , you didn &apos;t. no. no , it was funny , really .
and then today , you left , and i
knew--i knew the first time ,
and our first date meant so much to me .
olivia , fallon was right .
the spider story isn &apos;t even true .
what is--what is this ?
you want to know the truth about our--our first date ?
there was no spider. i , uh , i @-@ i was so nervous
that i was with you , i kept sweating through my shirt ,
so i was running to the bathroom to use the hand dryer to--
what ? this isn &apos;t funny. don &apos;t laugh .
i &apos;m not--i &apos;m trying-- i &apos;m
and then today ,
i rushed out of scrabble because i &apos;d just seen
your interview on tv , where you told the whole world
that today was our 1 @-@ month anniversary , you know , and ...
i mean , i &apos;m--i &apos;m usually very on the ball
with these things. s
stop , you are amazing .
and you &apos;re not the only one with a surprise today .
you &apos;re watching new york 1--
news all evening .
before we return to the race for the mayor of new york city ,
we first want to take you to the congressional election ,
which really couldn &apos;t be any closer .
at this time , with 85 % of the votes counted ,
mike sullivan has 49,837 votes .
what are you doing down here ? get back to your party .
i was hoping you &apos;d still be here. i wanted to thank you
for the sacrifice you made on that stage tonight ,
for me .
hey , i was happy to ,
because i believe in you .
here it is. and apparently , new york does , too .
we are now prepared to call the election in favor
of newcomer 26 @-@ year @-@ old william van der bilt ,
affectionately known to those around him as &quot; tripp . &quot;
that is right. with 96 % of the votes counted ...
i won .
yeah , you did. just do me one favor , though .
anything .
be the best congressman this district &apos;s ever seen .
i have complete faith in you. and after all , i mean ,
you &apos;re the only honest man in our family .
congrats .
thanks .
you deserve it .
i better get going before we &apos;re seen together
and another scandal erupts .
i promise you ,
one day i will make things right. i will fix this .
this is the beginning of a new van der bilt dynasty ,
one we can be proud of .
congratulatio
stay away from me .
blair , i &apos;m sorry .
i @-@ i shouldn &apos;t have done that .
but whether it was patrick tonight
or--or k.c. &apos; s clients at chuck &apos;s party ,
a real friend would have come to me with the problem ,
and we would have solved it
together . - seriously , serena ?
after 18 years of this , i actually feel sorry for you .
you &apos;re so far deep in serena world ,
you can &apos;t even recognize what &apos;s really going on .
throughout all my years with nate--
my whole life , really--
you &apos;ve always been number one .
and now for the first time ,
things are different .
i &apos;m different .
i have college
and a real relationship .
i &apos;m starting to build a life for myself .
i &apos;m building a life for myself , too .
with karter ? with your job as an assistant to a publicist
who pays you to date a whacked @-@ out movie star ?
you &apos;re drifting away from dan and your family ,
and you &apos;ve lost nate ,
one of your oldest friends .
this night is finally over ...
and as far as i &apos;m concerned , so are we .
who would have thought
that s. and b . &apos; s friendship had a term limit ?
sorry , ladies .
party &apos;s over .
thank you .
hey , brandeis .
i thought you &apos;d be long gone by now .
hey , blair. great party .
i am so sorry . i can &apos;t believe that
serena told everyone you were a prostitute .
that is , like , so crazy .
well , to be honest , it &apos;s not ... that crazy .
how so ?
it &apos;s true. i &apos;m a working girl .
i wanted to tell you , but we just met .
ew ! do you even go to school at n.y.u. ?
yes. and i am a psychcology major .
ask me anything-- freud , skinner , piaget .
i &apos;m still the same person , blair .
this is just how i pay for college and couture .
well , i have to run it by my people , but ...
we can still shop together , perhaps .
absolutely .
but right now ...
i got a job .
you used me to meet new clients ?
sorry , but i &apos;m new to the big apple .
and rotten to the core .
okay , come on . let &apos;s get you in , easy .
come on , watch your head .
hey , come on. let &apos;s go to bar blue .
no .
you have to , you &apos;re my girlfriend .
i can &apos;t be seen without you , remember ?
that &apos;s what you get paid for .
there you go , come on .
710 east 76th street .
tell miss cunningham she has a delivery .
i think nathaniel was brilliant tonight , don &apos;t you ?
brilliant ? foolish is more like it .
come on , william .
even you have to admit it .
this couldn &apos;t have worked any better if it was planned .
you .
all this time , you thought the only thing i was capable of
was holding his hand and smiling on the sidelines .
to be honest , my dear ,
i never really spent that much time thinking about you .
well , your loss is my gain .
my husband is a congressman .
and thanks to vanessa &apos;s camera ,
you &apos;re out of our lives for good .
finally tripp can be his own man ,
my man .
you think i &apos;m really just going to stand aside ,
let myself become collateral damage ?
i &apos;ll tell him .
you don &apos;t exactly have a lot of credibility right now .
who &apos;s he going to believe ?
i thought you said you were going home .
i changed my mind .
well , if i &apos;d known , i would have come sooner .
did you ever find brandeis ?
yes .
we &apos;re not friends anymore .
but that &apos;s okay .
i have you .
that &apos;s all i need .
sometimes it &apos;s hard to see the lines we &apos;ve drawn ...
until we cross them .
this is used for the sake cups .
all right , oh , you know , i did want to say something .
uh , we want to apologize for last time .
i was a little hard on your boyfriend ,
and i apologize for that , so , dan , if you &apos;re watching ,
we wanted to say happy anniversary .
oh !
this is for you , olivia and dan .
happy anniversary . i &apos;m very sorry .
thank you. oh !
that &apos;s when we rely on the ones we love to pull us back .
and give us something to hold on to .
congratulations , congressman .
serena , thank you .
shouldn &apos;t you be in the ballroom ?
probably .
where &apos;s your better half ?
i don &apos;t know . i was looking for her .
then i realized this might be
my last private moment for a while .
well , i can leave .
no , it &apos;s okay. stay. please .
i &apos;d love to have someone to sit with ,
not talking about politics , not talking about anything .
you wanna tell me about it ?
no . i don &apos;t think you want to hear this one .
i do. let your problem be the first that
i address as your elected representative .
okay , congressman .
but i &apos;m gonna warn you .
this one might need a special ...
uh , wait. this sounds serious .
bartender , i &apos;ll have what she &apos;s having .
uh , i &apos;ll have another , please. thank you .
then there are the clearly marked lines ,
the ones that if you dare cross ,
you may never find your way back .
