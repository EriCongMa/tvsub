earl , i told you to mop the entrance .
that floor is dirtier than bob saget
at a comedy central roast .
you know what it sounds like you need , cranky lady ?
a midol and a dove bar .
you watch it , too , oleg .
like earl &apos;s hip , you can be replaced .
have you noticed since max and caroline have been away ,
han is getting a little big for his bitches ?
did i say bitches ?
&apos;cause i meant to .
i will not be bossed around by someone 40 years younger than me .
he is not my second wife .
i am calling diner security .
what &apos;s up , earl ?
i mean , besides your blood pressure .
when are you coming back ?
we &apos;re coming back tomorrow night .
caroline &apos;s about to sign the movie contract ,
which means i don &apos;t have to come home ups ground .
are you on the phone with the diner ?
i feel like i can smell it .
i don &apos;t think any of us are gonna make it past tomorrow .
han &apos;s been walking around like he owns the place .
i do own the place !
boy , uber drivers do not like to be tickled .
and speaking of things no one would see coming ,
i used the f @-@ word with randy .
who wouldn &apos;t see that coming ?
you use the f @-@ word all the time ...
usually around children or clergy .
no , the f @-@ word as in &quot; future . &quot;
max , you made plans for the future ?
you won &apos;t even make dinner plans with me .
you always say , &quot; who knows if we &apos;ll still be friends by then ? &quot;
well , you always ask me , like , five hours ahead of time .
max , i &apos;m gonna go ahead and use the c @-@ word .
i &apos;m calling you and randy a couple .
i &apos;m gonna say something ,
and i don &apos;t want it to go to your head .
you &apos;re right , bitch .
see , max , it all worked out ,
right up until what i &apos;m about to say right now .
we have to take the shuttle to the airport tomorrow ,
&apos;cause we &apos;re still poor for another 27 business days .
let &apos;s go out in style and get a party bus .
after all these years , we still have
such different concepts of style .
come on !
with a stripper pole
and a crock @-@ pot of cocktail weenies .
i danced on a party bus for a year ,
not for money .
we are not taking a party bus .
this isn &apos;t your super sweet 16 .
i didn &apos;t have a sweet 16 .
i was in plumbing school .
hey , everybody .
i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on ,
but people on the elevator were looking at me funny .
sophie !
what ?
do i have spinach in my teeth ?
uh , no spinach , but about 25 needles stuck in your face .
yeah , they &apos;re helping me get pregnant .
my healer audra sent me to mao ,
the acupuncturist to the stars .
yep , he &apos;s poked more famous people than john mayer .
sophie , you &apos;re not supposed to leave with those needles ,
just like we &apos;re not supposed to leave with these vases .
tell you what , i &apos;m gonna do what i used to do
for my aunt becky at the elks lodge .
i &apos;m gonna get some pricks out of your face .
max , do you think randy invited me to dinner
to witness him asking you to be bicoastal ?
&apos;cause i don &apos;t think this mascara &apos;s waterproof ,
and i &apos;m definitely gonna cry
happy and a few jealous tears .
i &apos;m never been bicoastal .
i was bisexual for a week ,
but that &apos;s mostly because i was hitchhiking .
there they are .
oh , this is the table where we first met ,
and you thought i was a cheap hooker .
and you were only half right .
here they come , more jealous than i expected .
let &apos;s celebrate .
it &apos;s a big night for both of you .
caroline , your movie deal closed ,
and max , i found your sock .
it was under my refrigerator .
oh , that makes sense .
i was trying to fish an m &amp; m out from under there
with a fishing hook i made with a fork and my sock .
i was so excited about getting the m &amp; m
that i abandoned the sock .
max , you know you don &apos;t have to eat candy
that fell on the floor anymore .
i still will , but it &apos;s nice to know i don &apos;t have to .
oh , my god , your whole life is changing .
we &apos;re just waiting for someone else .
oh , no , did you invite a guy for me ?
i wish i &apos;d known ,
&apos;cause i only shaved up to the bottom of my dress .
it &apos;s not a date for you .
it &apos;s someone here for me and max .
wow , i don &apos;t usually bring up threesomes
till the one @-@ month mark when things start to go stale .
oh , definitely wasn &apos;t picturing this guy .
hello , i &apos;m elliot charles .
okay , two first names , slightly more interesting .
so doing the orgy math here , there &apos;s four of us ,
and out of the four , max and i can &apos;t touch naked .
her rule , not mine .
oh , i &apos;m not here in a sexual capacity .
i &apos;m randy &apos;s therapist .
and i guess we should get started .
i do have a 9 : 00 in the valley .
a 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl is coming out to her vegan parents
as meat @-@ curious .
um , what &apos;s happening ?
look , max ... elliot ?
look , max ,
my patient , randy ,
is breaking up with you .
what ?
max , i know this sounds abrupt .
elliot ?
max , in my practice , i developed
the ripping @-@ the @-@ band @-@ aid @-@ off technique .
you &apos;ll read about it in my book someday ,
if i ever finish it ,
but that &apos;s between me and my therapist .
he &apos;s not speaking to me right now
because of a couch spill .
and i &apos;d be mad as hell about it
if i didn &apos;t completely understand it !
and now , again , what &apos;s happening ?
because it seems like you &apos;re breaking up with me
using a therapist .
it does seem that way .
elliot ?
he is breaking up with you using a therapist .
look , randy ?
caroline .
look , elliot , you tell randy to be a grown @-@ up
and break up with her over text .
at least send her a &quot; bye , felicia &quot; bitmoji .
let &apos;s go .
max , don &apos;t go like this .
elliot , don &apos;t let max go like this .
max , you &apos;re hurt .
you &apos;re feeling abandoned .
what would be really helpful to you right now
is my book , if i can just get one chapter on paper .
i think people would benefit a lot from the book .
well , we &apos;re leaving .
this is shocking ,
and it &apos;s really hard to shock me
since that time i saw a mouse
dry @-@ humping a potato on my couch .
you know what ?
you can keep my sock .
on second thought , i need it .
max , wait .
i am just gonna go , because the last time i was this mad ,
someone lost an eyebrow .
and it took me a long time
to grow it back .
thank you .
max , hurry !
we have to leave now to take sophie to the healer
and still be at the airport by noon .
i brushed your hair when you were passed out .
i can &apos;t move any faster .
i think this escalator &apos;s broken .
i tried to stop you from drinking bottle number 32,
which was sriracha .
but you tied me to that chair so well .
well , since drinking that hot sauce ,
i &apos;ve been tied to a different chair .
i have something to make you feel better .
i doubt it .
unless it &apos;s a diaper full of ice .
it &apos;s not that . i &apos;ll meet you outside .
okay , okay , remember that party bus
i never wanted and you probably don &apos;t want now ?
surprise !
good timing .
i &apos;m feeling suicidal , and i &apos;ve always wanted
to be buried in something like this .
aw , come on , max , cheer up .
you &apos;re getting two poles for the price of one .
this is the first time a party bus
hasn &apos;t fixed every problem i have .
well , you haven &apos;t seen
my &quot; stars and stripes forever &quot; routine .
um , bert , is this rum
supposed to have a cigarette butt in it ?
if you gonna puke , please aim for the floor .
i can hose it down .
otherwise , i &apos;m finding corn in the pleather for months .
well , if i throw up today , it &apos;s not &apos; cause i &apos;m having fun .
i &apos;m just happy because , finally ,
there &apos;s ladies in the bus not wearing penis helmets .
nope , they were all out of penises ,
so i had to settle for balls .
here , girls .
nope , i will day drink on a bus ,
but i will not put balls on my head .
and you wonder why you &apos;re single .
ugh , there &apos;s that crazy expensive sushi place
where randy and i ate .
and there &apos;s the taco place we had to eat at afterwards
&apos;cause we were still hungry .
max , please , you have to put randy behind you .
and there &apos;s the parking spot where i put randy behind me .
bert , did we sign up for the hollywood
relationship death tour ?
if so , i &apos;d like to hit the affleck @-@ garner house .
在结婚十周年当日做出离婚决定
and right up there is where he lives .
we &apos;d make a right at that super ripped homeless guy ,
and in two or three blocks , we &apos;d be at randy &apos;s house .
oh , no , &quot; we do this , &quot; and &quot; we do that . &quot;
she &apos;s &quot; we &quot; -ing .
as long as nobody wees on the seats ,
we &apos;ll be fine .
bert , turn off there , up that street .
no , wait , what are you doing ?
you &apos;re getting closure .
i want him to face you without that lame therapist .
just you and him face @-@ to @-@ testicle .
ladies , just how stalker @-@ y are we getting here ?
like a drive around the cul @-@ de @-@ sac ?
or a full @-@ on demi moore
outside of mila kunis &apos; yoga class ?
后者是艾什顿 · 库彻的现任妻子
ooh , there it is .
up there on the left .
yep , there it is .
and there he is letting the dog out .
oh , and he &apos;s only wearing a towel .
ah , yeah .
now i get it , max .
bert , go . this was a bad idea .
no , this is a great idea .
i am not letting you take this bad feeling back to new york .
bert , open the door . i &apos;m going out .
bert , close the door . let &apos;s roll .
i , uh , wanted to put some clothes on ,
but caroline wouldn &apos;t let me .
oh , that &apos;s the smartest thing caroline &apos;s done since i &apos;ve met her .
max .
i &apos;m not here .
max , i can see your balls behind that pillow .
i can see your balls behind that--
sophie ! come on .
this is sad .
oh , well not from where i &apos;m sitting .
max , i &apos;m sorry about the way i handled things .
i just don &apos;t know how to break things off .
it &apos;s why i was the lawyer
on the last three adam sandler movies .
why ?
i just need to know why .
because i &apos;m too young ? i &apos;m too old ?
is there someone else ? you &apos;re married ? you &apos;re gay ?
with a body like that , gay is definitely on the table .
you want the truth ?
i like you too much .
that &apos;s why i didn &apos;t break it off sooner .
i didn &apos;t want it to end .
that &apos;s why you &apos;re breaking up with me ?
because you like me too much ?
at least have another family in mexico .
max , i &apos;ve done the long @-@ distance thing .
it &apos;s just putting off the inevitable .
you have a life there . i have a life here .
it doesn &apos;t work .
please don &apos;t hate me .
be easier if i could .
yep , here they come .
pardon me ?
are we still firing your housekeeper today ?
oh , nice hat .
confirms that theory that women in la
are the ones with balls .
this is it , girls .
this is where my healer does all her magic .
yeah , you know , she must sweat a lot doing it ,
&apos;cause it smells like it looks in here , right ?
what do you think &apos;s in those jars ?
every fart that &apos;s ever been held in at yoga ?
are you okay , max ?
i guess .
i just wish you told me closure
feels like someone just slammed my nuts
in the trunk of a pontiac .
sophie , we have to be at the airport in an hour .
yes , but audra is my last chance at getting pregnant .
she &apos;ll be ready when she &apos;s ready .
i mean , look around .
she &apos;s a professional .
have you seen an orange cat ?
a little depressed , sagittarius ?
wait , garfield lives here ?
audra , this is max and caroline .
you know , i rarely say this to a lady ,
but--oh , put a baby in me .
absolutely .
you think--you don &apos;t--okay .
go ahead .
i &apos;m sorry , i &apos;m just conferring with my spirit guides .
well , if you all talk at once , i can &apos;t understand you .
got it .
they &apos;re telling me that someone here
just had their heart broken .
it &apos;s you .
oh , my god , max .
come closer to me . come over here .
oh , gosh , thanks a lot .
you &apos;re bogarting my witch .
these spirits don &apos;t lie .
a little too honest sometimes .
i mean , i didn &apos;t ask them if they like my bangs ,
but they sure told me .
it was a whole thing .
you don &apos;t need to help me .
i &apos;ll get over the randy thing .
i &apos;ve been through worse things ,
like this right now .
no .
they &apos;re insisting that i help you .
grab me a jar .
that &apos;s where we store the pain ...
and lentils , once you &apos;re healed .
great .
no guy , but now i have a middle @-@ aged lesbian lover .
all right , it &apos;s out .
i thought i was gonna have to move to a bigger jar .
you must &apos;ve really liked this guy .
he was okay .
well , he &apos;s crushed .
he really liked you too .
never thought a jar could make me feel better
that wasn &apos;t filled with peanut brittle .
oh , please , spirits , put a baby in me !
all right , here we go .
quiet , everybody .
let me just close the door .
okay .
oh , wait .
there &apos;s still some other unrest here .
oh , no , that &apos;s way too big .
it &apos;s something else .
oh , really ?
oh , you &apos;re telling--
sure , sure .
okay . hold on .
i can &apos;t put a baby in you .
sorry , sophie .
you can &apos;t ?
you made me put needles in my eyes .
put me on with them .
hey , i &apos;m on your side .
her bangs are ridiculous .
hey , earl , we &apos;re back .
hi , girls .
let me be the first to say welcome back ,
and also , my deepest sympathies .
how are you , max ?
i just flew in from la ,
and boy , are my arms tired
from hitting the person next to me .
they would not stop fidgeting .
i had to pee , and you wouldn &apos;t let me out .
max , caroline , you &apos;re back !
i mean ... hello , how are you ?
han , did you miss us ?
oh , please , i miss you like
america misses radioshack .
surprisingly , it left a hole .
i saw you leave a hole once ...
on groundhog day .
在这一天冬眠的土拨鼠要醒过来 从洞里出来预测春天
max , caroline , where &apos;s sophie ?
i missed her so much .
you know what they say :
absence makes
me have to masturbate almost constantly .
so what did the healer say ?
we &apos;ll let her tell you .
hey , everybody !
i &apos;m back from california .
i hope i didn &apos;t , like ,
totally pick up an accent , dude .
oh , i was worried jeremy renner
would make you the last thing he &apos;d ever be in .
and i was worried you &apos;d say something exactly like that .
well , i &apos;ll be in my booth .
so what did the healer say ?
how soon can we get a baby in you ?
oh , well , the truth is , oleg ,
the healer said that she wouldn &apos;t be able
to help me get pregnant .
oh , sophie . why not ?
well , the reason
that i can &apos;t get pregnant is ...
i &apos;m already pregnant !
yeah !
i &apos;m gonna be a father ?
yes , i &apos;m three months along .
yeah , no , that &apos;s the last time
i &apos;ll buy a pregnancy test off a boat .
well , let &apos;s bust out the very cheap ,
non @-@ alcoholic champagne .
non @-@ alcoholic ?
yeah , sophie can &apos;t drink when she &apos;s pregnant .
oh , all right .
well , then , the five martinis that i had on the plane
were my last .
