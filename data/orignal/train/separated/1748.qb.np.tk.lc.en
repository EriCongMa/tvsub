i recently read that during world war two ,
joseph stalin had a research program
to create supersoldiers
by having women impregnated by gorillas .
what a sick use of science .
hey , as long as the baby &apos;s healthy .
i wonder if stalin considered any other animals .
hippos are the deadliest creature .
a half @-@ human , half @-@ hippo soldier would be pretty badass .
yes , but when they &apos;re hungry @-@ hungry ,
you can stop them with marbles .
yeah , the correct animal
for interspecies supersolider is koala .
you would wind up with an army so cute it couldn &apos;t be attacked .
but half @-@ man , half @-@ owl could fly ...
the answer is cuddly soldiers with big flat noses .
moving on .
so , penny , when &apos;s the new job start ?
next monday .
did you get a chance to look over the materials i gave you ?
uh , not yet , but i will .
great . when ?
i said i &apos;ll get to it .
i &apos;m sensing awkwardness , am i right ?
yes .
swish .
i don &apos;t want to be pushy ,
but you &apos;ve never done pharmaceutical sales before .
it seems like you could use this time to get a head start .
well , the first few weeks will be all training .
they &apos;ll tell me everything i need to know .
but imagine how impressed they &apos;d be if you showed up
already familiar with the material .
okay , so what , you want me to be like a teacher &apos;s pet ?
couldn &apos;t hurt .
mm , i don &apos;t know .
who here has ever been hurt
because they were the teacher &apos;s pet ?
it was like the rest of the class wanted ms. mcdonald
to forget the quiz .
mrs. davis .
guess who ?
dr. cooper .
that &apos;s right , good job .
hello .
uh , you wanted to see me ?
yes . uh , welcome back .
thank you .
i assume you &apos;d like to reopen our dialogue
about the university forcing me to continue with string theory ?
you mean the dialogue that went ,
&quot; please ? &quot; &quot; no . &quot; &quot; please ? &quot; &quot; no . &quot; &quot; please ? &quot; &quot; no . &quot;
that &apos;s the one .
i believe you went last , so , uh , please ?
dr. cooper , while you were away , we came up with a solution
that would allow you to change your field of study .
pouting and running away actually worked .
yeah , i must say , that may not be a lesson
you want to reinforce with me .
so , um , what is the solution ?
currently , you &apos;re being paid under a grant
to specifically research string theory .
if we promote you to junior professor ,
you &apos;ll be able to choose
whatever field of research you &apos;d like .
but if i &apos;m a professor , then i &apos;ll have to teach a class .
that is correct .
so your solution is to promote me and pay me more money
so that i can impart my knowledge
to the next generation of scientists ?
yes .
you people are sick .
hey . ready to go to lunch ?
just give me a minute .
i &apos;m stimulating the pleasure cells of this starfish .
i just need to turn it off .
what happens if you don &apos;t ?
then i have to sit through lunch
knowing this starfish is having a better day than i am .
is bernadette meeting us at the restaurant ?
uh , no . actually , i didn &apos;t invite her .
how come ?
well , ever since she helped me get this job ,
she won &apos;t stop bugging me .
well , i think she just wants you to do well ,
and she &apos;s worried that you won &apos;t
&apos;cause you were just a stunningly poor waitress .
that is not true .
i &apos;m still waiting on my mini corndogs from two years ago .
i told you , they &apos;ll be right out .
okay , so no bernadette .
well , you saw her the other night . am i wrong ?
no , i just ...
i feel kind of uncomfortable talking about her like this .
usually when someone &apos;s being talked about behind their back ,
it &apos;s me and it &apos;s right in front of my face .
i @-@ i &apos;m sorry . i just need a little break from her .
i understand .
you know , there is some research that indicates
that sharing negative attitudes about a third party
can be a powerful bonding force between two friends .
so , what are you saying ?
i &apos;m saying , in the spirit of science ,
what is that little skank &apos;s problem ?
so , i &apos;ve been trying to come up
with a cute couple &apos;s nickname for me and emily .
what do you like better--
emippali ...
or koothrapemily ?
why is it your last name and her first name ?
oh , well , her last name is sweeney ,
and something just didn &apos;t seem right about koothrapeeney .
hey , how &apos;d it go with human resources ?
awful .
yeah , they &apos;re allowing me to move on from string theory ,
but they made me a junior professor
and are requiring me to teach a class .
i don &apos;t understand . why is it bad that you have to teach ?
what a stupid question .
the kids are gonna love him .
i can &apos;t believe i have to waste my time
babysitting a bunch of grad students
who probably think dark matter is what &apos;s in their diapers .
this might not be that bad .
uh , you like telling people they &apos;re wrong .
wrong !
just because i enjoyed that one doesn &apos;t mean i always do .
you enjoy giving people grades .
a valid point , but unoriginal-- b @-@ minus .
and you love the sound of your own voice .
yeah , well , of course i do .
listen to it .
it &apos;s like an earful of melted caramel .
look , most importantly ,
this will let you move on and study dark matter .
it is true that many of my heroes have taken students
under their wings :
feynman , einstein , professor x.
x教授 即查尔斯 · 塞维尔 x战警学校的校长及创办人
humorously ,
in the case of professor x ,
some of his students actually had wings .
that &apos;s rich .
i &apos;ll use that one to lighten the mood
after my entire class fails the midterm .
measuring starfish serotonin levels in response to
one point two molar stimulation of pleasure cells .
you like that , don &apos;t you ?
that &apos;s right , say my name .
hey , what &apos;s going on ?
not much .
you want to get a drink later ?
just the two of us ?
no penny ?
not tonight . i &apos;m a little frustrated with her .
because you got her the job and you think
she should be working harder to prepare for it ?
so it &apos;s not just me . you see it , too !
i do , i see it .
it &apos;s driving me crazy .
just this afternoon , i saw on instagram
that instead of studying , she went out to lunch
and got a manicure .
that &apos;s outrageous !
i know !
if she doesn &apos;t do well ,
th @-@ this could reflect poorly on you .
exactly . does she not realize it or does she not care ?
i don &apos;t know .
the important thing is i am here for you
so we can mutually disparage this unpleasing third party .
hey . we just wanted to see how your class was going .
where is everybody ?
there is no class .
did you send everyone to the principal &apos;s office already ?
no one signed up .
well , that &apos;s not your fault .
i called the department secretary to see what happened .
apparently , i have a reputation for being obnoxious .
what ?
hey , sheldon , i &apos;m sorry .
no , it &apos;s fine .
now i can devote all my time to dark matter .
aw , you brought cookies for everyone ?
oh , yes . fig newtons .
i was going to ask them : which scientist both helped
to develop calculus
and had a famous cookie named after him ?
and then after someone said &quot; newton , &quot;
i was going to tell them they &apos;re wrong .
the cookies are named after a town in massachusetts .
and then i &apos;d throw the cookies away .
hey , what if i took your class ?
why would you do that ?
yeah , why would you do that ?
what &apos;s wrong with you ?
i &apos;m thinking about getting my doctorate ,
and he wants to teach-- why not ?
oh , howard .
i appreciate the gesture ,
but this is a graduate @-@ level physics class .
i don &apos;t think you &apos;d understand
a single thing i was talking about .
ask why not again ; i &apos;ve got an answer .
sheldon , i &apos;m more than smart enough to take your class .
no .
yes .
how would you determine the ground state
of a quantum system with no exact solution ?
i would guess a wave @-@ function and then vary its parameters
until i found the lowest energy solution .
do you know how to integrate x squared times e
to the minus x , without looking it up ?
i &apos;d use feynman &apos;s trick--
differentiate under the integral sign .
okay .
what is the correct interpretation of quantum mechanics ?
since every interpretation gives exactly the same answer
to every measurement , they are all equally correct .
however , i know you believe in the many worlds interpretation ,
so i &apos;ll say that . now do you think i &apos;m smart enough ?
no .
oh , come on . you might &apos;ve gone to school
for a couple more years than me , but guess what--
engineers are just as smart as physicists .
you take that back !
no .
so , after drinks with bernadette ,
i get home , and penny calls to complain about her .
and then while i &apos;m talking to penny ,
i get a text from bernadette .
wh ... i &apos;m trying to prepare my lesson plan for howard .
why are you telling me this ?
because it &apos;s taken 15 years ,
but high school is finally awesome !
i love them both ,
but i &apos;m in the center now , and i love that even more .
amy , please . i am trying to figure out a way
to intellectually emasculate a dear friend of mine .
but i &apos;m just ...
not now .
you better watch that attitude , buddy .
you &apos;re dating the popular girl now .
you &apos;re up late .
oh , i &apos;m working on my lesson plan for wolowitz .
he is going to be so lost .
look at this section over here .
even i don &apos;t really understand it .
sheldon , why are you doing this ?
i &apos;m a teacher , leonard .
it &apos;s my job .
no , i @-@ i mean ,
why are you going to so much trouble
to prove that you &apos;re smarter than wolowitz ?
oh , it &apos;s no trouble ; it &apos;s actually a pleasure .
you want to know what i think ?
i think the idea that someone could be as smart as you ,
or even smarter , scares the pants off you ,
and you can &apos;t deal with it .
interesting point .
wh ... you &apos;re suggesting
that i have emotional issues below my consciousness
which drive my behavior ,
thus causing me to lash out at anything or anyone
that threatens my intellectual superiority .
might be something to think about .
leonard ?
yeah .
howard &apos;s allergic to peanuts .
how can i use that against him ?
okay , now that everyone &apos;s here , we can begin .
before we do , i just talked to leonard .
and if you &apos;re gonna
spend all your time trying to belittle me
by making this class unnecessarily hard ,
then i &apos;m out .
but if you &apos;re interested in making
a sincere effort to be a good teacher ,
then i &apos;m willing to give this a shot .
i suppose that &apos;s a fair request .
there &apos;s no reason we both can &apos;t benefit from this experience .
okay .
okay .
well , then , uh , first things first .
um , are you familiar with the brachistochrone problem ?
i am .
good .
and how it relates to the calculus of variations ?
it &apos;s an inverted cycloid .
wonderful .
now , what about euler @-@ lagrange theorems ?
that &apos;s where i &apos;m a little fuzzy .
ha ! i knew it ! all right .
we have a lot of information to cover before your first test .
which , by the way , is in eight minutes .
the good news is i &apos;m grading on a curve ,
so you &apos;re pretty much guaranteed a c.
* all i do is win , win , win *
* no matter what *
what are you doing ?
* everybody hands go up , up ... *
* and they stay there ! *
what are you doing ?
if you &apos;re gonna be a crappy teacher ,
then i &apos;m gonna be a crappy student .
* ludacris going in on the verse *
* &apos; cause i never been defeated and i won &apos;t stop now .. *
will you stop it !
this is a classroom .
this is not american bandstand . okay .
now , where was i ?
let &apos;s see .
oh , yes . over here .
you ...
what are you doing now ?
making a straw .
why ?
so i can shoot you with a spitball .
you &apos;re not going to do that , and i &apos;ll tell you why .
this is an institution of higher learning ,
i am your professor ,
and you &apos;re going to treat me with the prop ...
you shot your spit in my mouth !
is that gonna be on the test ?
because i don &apos;t think i can do that again .
hey , girlfriend .
can i get a what what ?
what ?
close enough .
um , i was just calling to see what you were up tonight .
thought maybe we could hit up color me mine ,
maybe sneak in some pinot greej . whatevs .
uh , thanks , but i think i &apos;m gonna stay in
and go over the stuff bernadette gave me .
oh . oh , i hear you .
try and get that nag off your back , right ?
i mean , you &apos;re not a bicycle ;
why &apos;s she riding you like that ?
no , i think she was just trying to help .
plus , i really want to do well at this job . so ...
okay , good luck . and call me later ,
you know , if you decide she &apos;s a bitch or something .
hey , girlfriend .
hey , amy .
tonight . you , me , color me mine .
maybe we sneak in some pinot-- make it color me wine .
that sounds fun , but i promised penny
i &apos;d come by and help her study .
oh . well , good luck getting her to do that .
she &apos;s probably off getting another manicure .
you remember when she did that ?
you remember ?
i was probably being too hard on her .
we talked , we &apos;re good .
oh . great .
i &apos;m happy for you guys .
you know , when the two of you aren &apos;t getting along ,
it puts me in a really weird position .
well , don &apos;t worry-- everything &apos;s back to normal .
you mean , like , where she &apos;s nice to your face ?
okay got it . bye .
hey , boyfriend .
can &apos;t talk . spitball .
probably gonna die .
well ?
sheldon , i @-@ i promise .
your uvula does not have an std .
are you sure ?
it just doesn &apos;t feel as innocent as it used to .
you reported me to human resources ?
you violated the sanctity of my mouth .
well , i dropped your class , so i hope you &apos;re happy .
i told you you weren &apos;t smart enough to take it .
i &apos;m smart enough , sheldon .
asking me a bunch of questions
about a topic i &apos;m not familiar with
doesn &apos;t prove anything .
i could do the same to you .
yeah ... try me .
okay .
you enjoy making fun of engineering so much ;
how do you quantify the strength of materials ?
young &apos;s modulus .
is that right ?
yeah .
okay , how do you prevent eddy currents in a transformer ?
laminate the core material .
come on , give him a hard one .
that was a hard one .
all right .
how does the flow rate in a pipe depend on its diameter ?
you don &apos;t know , do you ?
what &apos;s the matter , smart guy ?
don &apos;t know poiseuille &apos;s law ?
thank goodness i got it !
now i can quit checking my stool .
okay , what are the potential side effects
for our erectile dysfunction drug ?
headaches , dizziness and nausea .
yes .
those are also the side effects
of having a 75 @-@ year @-@ old man with an erection climb on top of you .
want to stop here ?
uh , no . i can keep going .
nah , you got this .
let &apos;s go for a drink . i &apos;ll call amy .
okay , good . she seemed like she really wanted to go out tonight .
hey , girl .
okay , next question , for the butterfinger :
how long is a galactic year ?
250 million years !
yes !
okay , this one is for a cadbury creme egg .
it &apos;s not even easter time .
this is crazy !
which archimedean solid has 20 regular triangular faces ,
30 square faces , 12 pentagonal faces ,
60 vertices and 120 edges ?
the rhombicosidodecahedron !
yes !
we are so smart !
why didn &apos;t girls like us in high school ?
because we were awkward and weird
and couldn &apos;t play sports !
right again !
