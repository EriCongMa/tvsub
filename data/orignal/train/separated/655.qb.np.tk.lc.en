daddy !
when i was a child ,
my father was framed for a crime he didn &apos;t commit .
daddy !
amanda !
you can &apos;t stay .
i don &apos;t remember asking for your permission .
how much will it cost to get you to stop seeing my daughter ?
oh , my god .
amanda ?
i want to come home , jack .
tyler got hold of a shredded speech
exposing conrad and victoria .
this is satoshi takeda .
i fear i &apos;m losing control .
revenge is a stony path .
you remember well .
one thing you can count on , i never forget .
how does it feel now that your targets
are no longer mere ideas , but flesh and bone ?
the task in front of you requires absolute focus .
if you let your emotions guide you ,
you will fail .
prioritize the obstacles to your end goal .
eliminate them ... one at a time .
there are two of them .
tyler . he &apos;s simple , or oughta be .
and then there &apos;s amanda .
she &apos;s a ticking time bomb .
then you must stay clear of the blast .
how ?
engage your opponent to do the work for you .
victoria ?
victoria ,
good morning .
i made a breakfast reservation for us
so we could continue our discussion
from the other night .
today is not a good day ,
and please continue addressing me as ms. grayson .
okay , my apologies .
are you all right ?
conrad filed for divorce .
i &apos;ve had better mornings .
well , don &apos;t worry . i &apos;m sure you &apos;ll come out on top .
what makes you so sure ?
well , you &apos;re victoria grayson .
you have two children who love you ,
friends who would do anythg for you ,
an entire community that worships you .
and you have me .
anything you need ,
i can take care of it .
can you bring my son home to me ?
i can certainly try .
thank you .
ashley .
victoria &apos;s fine .
tyler , are you decent ?
or more importantly , alone ?
yeah , come on in .
i wasn &apos;t sure i &apos;d see you
after your freak @-@ out at the investment party .
freak @-@ out ? i let you off easy .
one minute i &apos;m under the impression
we might actually have a future together ,
and the next
i catch you lip @-@ locked with nolan ross .
yeah , well , as unpleasant as
that was for you and me ,
the extra bit of attention i paid nolan
was done with our future in mind .
nolan &apos;s $ 20 mil
is being wired as we speak .
and i &apos;m headed in to collect my commission .
200 large .
you kiss a billionaire once , you make 200 grand .
i have been kissing victoria &apos;s ass all summer ,
and i &apos;m lucky if she lets me call her by her first name .
so let me share the wealth .
i have a 9 : 00 reservation at driftwood tomorrow night .
i don &apos;t need to tell you what a hard get that is .
so you &apos;re not even bi ?
what i am is ambitious .
if you can &apos;t handle that , then we part as friends .
but if i were you ,
i &apos;d strongly consider joining me .
now that i have a foothold with grayson ,
i &apos;m climbing all the way to the top .
and this invitation ...
it won &apos;t be open forever .
jack ?
you in here ?
chill , cujo .
sammy .
stop . stop it . come here .
sorry . he &apos;s got issues with strangers .
apparently , he doesn &apos;t remember that you aren &apos;t one .
well , it &apos;s been a while .
well , yeah , and he &apos;s
more than a little senile .
i was just bringing breakfast down to the boat .
you still like blueberry pancakes ?
who doesn &apos;t like pancakes ?
i still remember the day i met sammy .
same day i met you .
on the beach ...
down in front of your house .
we played tug @-@ of @-@ war with him and piece of driftwood .
sorry , um ...
memory lane isn &apos;t exactly a road i like to go down .
no , no , no . of course . of course .
i hope you don &apos;t mind .
i , uh , swiped one of your shirts .
looks better on you than me .
so did you make a decision about sticking around ?
yeah .
but if i &apos;m gonna stay in the hamptons ,
i &apos;m gonna need some new clothes .
want to pick some out with me ?
i &apos;d love to ,
but i haven &apos;t figured out how to get the bar to open self .
i can &apos;t tell you how good it feels to have you back .
and i can &apos;t tell you ...
how long it &apos;s been since someone was this nice to me .
thanks , jack .
you make it easy .
so a quick recap ,
in case you &apos;ve been too busy knocking boots with the young grayson
to remember what happened on last week &apos;s episode of &quot; the tyler chronicles . &quot;
i remember , nolan . get to the point .
well , after tyler finished apologizing
for taking my credit card on a petty theft crime spree ,
he started google stalking one david clarke .
take a look .
now check out my browser history .
have you wired money over to grayson global yet ?
happening as we speak .
$ 20 million .
pull it back .
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s a good idea .
what ? if i pull my money
and crush tyler &apos;s chances of becoming a grayson ,
ems , who knows what he &apos;ll do next ?
well , hopefully ,
he &apos;ll try to blackmail conrad with what &apos;s in that speech .
oh , really ?
i don &apos;t know .
i thought you had bigger , badder plans
for the graysons .
i do .
lydia &apos;s speech contains information not evidence .
and let &apos;s not forget ,
tyler no longer has it in his possession , we do .
which you never thanked me for , by the way .
i &apos;ll thank you when tyler &apos;s out of the picture .
unless , of course ,
you have your own reasons for keeping him around .
i &apos;ll call my business manager this afternoon .
how about ...
you call him now ?
nolan ross for barry josslin .
yeah , it &apos;s about money .
my father filed for divorce ?
why wouldn &apos;t he have told me this morning ?
who knows ?
but your poor mother is beside herself .
she really needs you right now , daniel .
in fact , she was hoping you &apos;d join her for lunch .
perfect timing .
please join me for lunch today with my mother .
yeah , of course . just tell me when and where .
1 : 00 , dumas &apos; on main .
i &apos;ll modify the reservation for three .
bye .
thanks , ash .
is everything okay ?
it sounds like my parents are finally getting a divorce .
oh , my god . i &apos;m so sorry , daniel .
they seemed ...
so perfect together .
yeah , maybe a long time ago .
well , maybe they &apos;ll work it out .
i mean , who knows ?
it might even strengthen your relationship with both of them .
yeah , with my mom , perhaps .
you know , i think my dad would rather have tyler
for a son than me .
well , it &apos;s hard to argue considering that
my dad &apos;s been trying to land nolan as a client
ever since nolcorp went public .
i guess ty has just got that magic touch .
i &apos;ll say .
what &apos;s that supposed to mean ?
the only reason that nolan invested with your father
is because tyler &apos;s blackmailing him .
wait . blackmailing him with what ?
do you have any idea how much e. coli
you just dumped next to my lunch ?
there &apos;s a reason i don &apos;t carry cash .
and that &apos;s why .
lighten up , eeyore .
i &apos;m paying you back for all the stuff i bought
on your credit card , like i promised .
you do you realize you &apos;re paying me back
with my own money , right ?
i &apos;m trying to say thank you .
you have no idea the doors you opened up for me .
we should celebrate , get out of town for the weekend ,
on me .
you like south beach ?
miami &apos;s for trolls .
okay , then . you pick the place .
i just want to spend some ...
quality time with you .
monte carlo &apos;s pretty nice this time of year .
excuse me . victoria .
yes .
i &apos;m ryan huntley .
michael davis introduced us a couple of years ago
at an art auction at sotheby &apos;s .
you outbid me on a spectacular kandinsky .
i remember . you cost me a fortune .
forgive me for being indelicate ,
but your husband asked to retain me as his divorce attorney .
and you just happened to run into me here ?
for reasons of my own , i declined his offer .
but believe me when i say , i @-@ i &apos;d love nothing more
than to represent you against your husband .
i &apos;ll give it some thought .
please do .
hey , ma .
daniel , i &apos;m so glad you could come .
and i see that you brought emily .
victoria , i hope you don &apos;t mind .
daniel told me everything ,
and we just really wanted to come and show our support .
i &apos;m sure you must be devastated .
devastated is not the word i would use .
and quite frankly ,
my marriage is the last thing i want ttalkboutight now .
well , why don &apos;t we talk about tyler ?
don &apos;t you think it &apos;s weird he &apos;s still living in the pool house
even though i &apos;m staying at emily &apos;s ?
quite the opposite .
with you gone , i rather like having him there .
tyler seems almost like family to me .
okay , but he &apos;s not and he never will be .
i &apos;d rather have someone in the house than no one at all .
unless of course you &apos;re telling me
that you &apos;re planning on moving back home .
uh , no .
mm . well , then ...
as far as i &apos;m concerned , he stays .
how &apos;s the wonder dog ?
starting to lose it a little , i &apos;m afraid .
how so ?
i don &apos;t know if i told you ,
amanda was his first owner .
but every time he sees her , he goes crazy ,
and not in a good way .
well , that &apos;s uncomfortable .
yeah , well , to be fair ,
i don &apos;t think she remembers much about him either .
she &apos;s blocked out most of her childhood .
and she really hates talking about it .
hmm . is she around ?
clothes shopping .
she decided to stick around and face her demons .
yeah , she seems to have a lot of those .
jack , it might not be any of my business , but ...
what happened to her when she lived in my house ?
i remember when i was , uh ...
when i was a kid ,
my old man tried to explain to me that , uh ,
that her dad had been arrested .
and i didn &apos;t get it ,
cause mr. clarke was always such a nice guy .
but then when i was old enough ,
i started reading everything about it ,
about how he was responsible for bringing down a whole plane full of people .
and as for amanda ...
it &apos;s like she just vanished .
i think my childhood pretty much ...
ended at the same time .
can &apos;t i take sammy with me ?
i &apos;m sure your friend will take good care of the dog .
won &apos;t you , jack ?
the best . i swear .
say good @-@ bye , amanda .
i &apos;ll come back for you .
i promise .
i promise . i &apos;ll come back for you .
i &apos;ll come back !
it wasn &apos;t her fault .
would you mind giving this to amanda ?
i &apos;m sure she has some warm memories of living there , too .
maybe spending some time in the house
will help her remember them .
you &apos;re a really good person , you know that ?
you take care of him for me , okay ?
stay .
you &apos;d think with a 200k commission ,
you &apos;d have settled somewhere a little flashier by now .
what the hell , danny ? you scared the crap out of me .
you think it &apos;s time you found a place of your own ?
already started looking .
yeah , well , look faster .
well , it &apos;s a matter of time before
i fill the void in that corner office
right next to your father .
i &apos;m assuming that &apos;s where all this hostility is coming from .
my dad &apos;s been trying for ten years to land nolan ross ,
and you do it in one night .
what &apos;s your secret ?
if i told you , i &apos;d have to kill you .
since when did we start hiding things from each other ?
nothing to hide , danny .
i just figured out what makes nolan tick .
it &apos;s a gift .
oh , sure it is .
i &apos;ll be right there .
sorry .
hi . i &apos;m glad you showed .
i thought maybe you &apos;d gone completely rogue on me .
i @-@ i didn &apos;t mean to tell jack our secret .
it just happened .
i just don &apos;t want him to get hurt .
that makes two of us .
jack &apos;s the best thing that &apos;s ever happened to me ...
besides you .
he mentioned that you have a hard time
talking about your childhood memories .
that &apos;s only because he remembers more of this stuff
than you actually told me .
what &apos;s this ?
it &apos;s a diary from when i was in foster care .
if you &apos;re gonna be amanda clarke ,
you need to know absolutely everything ,
especially the truth about the graysons .
what truth ?
hey , babe .
oh , i &apos;m sorry .
i didn &apos;t realize you had company .
daniel , this is amanda clarke .
amanda , daniel .
nice to meet you .
likewise .
i was just leaving .
feel free to come by anytime .
amanda clarke ?
as in david clarke &apos;s daughter ?
as in jack &apos;s new girlfriend .
wait . you &apos;re not talking about that david clarke ?
what , you didn &apos;t know ?
he used to own this place .
oh , my god .
my realtor conveniently neglected to mention that .
yeah , well , i didn &apos;t really know them ,
but her father was working for my father
when all those people were killed .
how horrible for your family .
well , it was a long time ago .
how was the rest of your day ?
well , i decided not to tell my father about tyler .
he &apos;ll dig his own grave .
the only way for me to truly beat him
should be on merit .
i like that plan .
great . then i hope you won &apos;t mind joining me tonight
for dinner with mr.takeda.
i &apos;m gonna need my japanese translater .
of course .
you &apos;re a gem .
i &apos;m gonna take a shower .
hey , fancy pants ,
come here often ?
buy a girl a drink ?
yeah , i don &apos;t get it .
you could be nibbling croissants
next to the louvre .
instead you &apos;re shelling peanuts in some dive bar
where , let &apos;s face it , nobody wants you .
well , i think jack would disagree .
emily , too .
she &apos;s really embracing the idea of having me around ,
even agreed that i &apos;d continue using her name .
somebody &apos;s jealous .
yeah , there are two on the lease .
it &apos;s me and my girlfriend .
no , i &apos;ll be 18 by the end of the month , so it &apos;s ...
let me call you right back .
what was that about ?
me and charlotte are getting a place together .
whoa , whoa , whoa . what ?
look , think about it , okay ?
you and me are crowding each other up here .
and--and things are moving forward with you amanda ,
so it &apos;s-- we need privacy .
declan , listen to me .
this is a spectacularly bad idea on so many levels
you don &apos;t have the money .
you haven &apos;t finishi high school .
what &apos;s the plan ?
gonna be a bar back the rest of your life ?
i &apos;m drowning downstairs
&apos;cause you can barely even do that right .
okay . hire someone else .
i &apos;ve got my own money , and charlotte needs me .
she needs you ?
yeah .
declan , you &apos;re just a kid .
what you need is to finish high school , go to college .
you need to make yourself into the kind of man
that a girl like charlotte grayson deserves .
if she &apos;s still around after that ,
then you guys can talk about having a future .
otherwise , you &apos;re just ...
you &apos;re just throwing both of yours away .
your crusade for a future built on sustained , renewable energy
is admirable ,
and a cause i proudly stand behind .
he says that he ... is impressed by your research
and respects your business ethics .
well , it &apos;s what he can expect on a daily basis
should he choose to trust me with his business .
so he &apos;s still on the fence ?
no .
what did he say ?
he &apos;s agreed to invest with you .
$ 50 million .
what , no synchronized swim with your secret sharer ?
single white female told me you invited her into the fold .
what , i &apos;m guessing this is
a keep your frenemies close type situation ?
at least she &apos;s under control , nolan .
that &apos;s more than i can say for you and tyler .
about that . uh ...
well , operation tyler hit a bit of a speed bump and--
don &apos;t worry about it .
i &apos;ve got that under control , too
bye , nolan .
while we &apos;re buying the upside ,
we &apos;re shorting the poorest performers in that sector .
simultaneously collecting the best in breed and weeding out the runts .
you catch on fast. son .
tyler , dad . .
there he is , the man of the hour .
did i miss something ?
daniel managed to get mr.takeda to invest last night .
$ 50 million .
how &apos;s that corner office looking for you now ?
$ 50 million . wow .
shame you won &apos;t be getting commissioned .
that commission was a onetime incentive .
tyler did beat you to the punch .
but you keep taking initiative like that ,
and i promise , commissions will abound .
that &apos;s right .
so long as your clients are all japanese .
don &apos;t forget to cut in your pretty blonde translator .
that &apos;s okay . you can let him get to you .
envy can be a powerful motivator .
i don &apos;t envy tyler , dad .
in fact ... there &apos;s something you need to know
about how he got nolan ross to invest with your company .
good boy , sammy .
good boy . yeah .
attaboy , sammy .
looks like someone &apos;s memory is coming back .
sam &apos;s not the only one .
i found this on the beach this morning .
it reminded me of how you and i
used to collect that sea glass .
you had a thing for the blue .
we buried jars of that stuff all over the place .
said it was our secret treasure , remember ?
like it was yesterday .
i was very happy to get your call , victoria .
i &apos;m very aware of the job you did for michael
in his divorce against lydia .
and i think it would be foolish of me
not to consider your counsel .
thank you .
it seems my reputation precedes me .
i saw michael earlier this summer ,
already with a pretty young woman at his arm .
i trust he &apos;s doing well ?
engaged .
god help him .
obviously , his heart is faring a little bit better than lydia &apos;s .
couldn &apos;t help but feel badly when i heard that she had
jumped from her balcony .
well , you reap what you sow .
well , before we discuss my fee ,
i &apos;ll need you to agree to some nonnegotiable conditions .
i see .
first condition--
no contact whatsoever with your spouse , starting now .
that won &apos;t be a problem .
second--
i need absolute financial transparency from you--
bank accounts , lock boxes ,
planes , houses , jewelry .
there &apos;s no need for the dramatic pauses , mr. huntley .
if i disagree with your terms , i &apos;ll let you know .
finally ,
and most importantly ,
i need you to be willing to do whatever it takes
to win your case ,
which could mean you end up with a significant amount
of conrad &apos;s blood on your hands by the time this is over .
i wouldn &apos;t have it any other way .
hey . we &apos;re gonna be late for our apartment meetings .
we &apos;re not gonna be late , charlotte ,
because i canceled &apos; em .
you don &apos;t want to move in with me ?
i @-@ i &apos;ve never wanted anything more .
but it can &apos;t be like this .
you--you have a nice life carved out for you here .
yeah , and you &apos;re a part of it now .
yeah , i want to be a part of it forever .
but if we are gonna last , then i have to finish school .
i don &apos;t know , maybe go to college .
you deserve a guy like that .
well , you don &apos;t have to do this just for me .
well , i &apos;m not . i &apos;m doing it for us .
here &apos;s your mom &apos;s check .
keep it .
think of it as my mother &apos;s investment in your future .
it &apos;s not my style .
i &apos;ll find another way .
you wanted to see me , sir ?
yeah .
it &apos;s come to my attention you garnered mr. ross &apos; support
through less @-@ than @-@ honorable circumstances .
so your time here at grayson global is over .
with all due respect , who cares how i got him ?
$ 20 million from a guy that
you &apos;ve been trying to land for a decade is hardly ...
this company &apos;s worth over 200 times that ,
which is why we try to avoid scandal at all cost .
blackmailing a potential client into a portfolio
falls directly into the scandalous category .
blackmail ?
the sex tape you made with nolan ross ?
sex tape ? what are you talking about ?
save your breath .
you &apos;re fired .
am i ?
at least when i do business , people don &apos;t die .
i beg your pardon ?
you want a scandal ?
you fire me , and i tell the world
that you and your wife were the real reason
all those people died on flight 197 .
and that guy who worked for you ,
david clarke ,
was just a patsy .
i &apos;d think very carefully about the next words
that come out of your mouth , mr. grayson .
excuse me .
can i help you ?
i &apos;m , uh , looking for something
i buried as a little kid .
yeah , well , i don &apos;t think it &apos;s cool for you to be here
without emily around .
well , emily said it &apos;s cool , so ...
she didn &apos;t mention it to me ,
so you should probably come back when she &apos;s here .
do you have a problem with me ?
you don &apos;t even know me .
exactly .
what &apos;s going on ?
your boyfriend here is trying to throw me off you property
for looking for something that belongs to me .
no , it &apos;s okay , daniel .
um , well , maybe you could , uh , come back tomorrow morning .
and i &apos;ll help you search for what you &apos;re trying to find .
told you she was cool .
that girl makes me nervous .
she just seems a little ... lost to me .
i mean , can you imagine
growing up the way she had to ?
just be careful with her .
i will .
what are you doing ?
can you tell me why you &apos;re looking for
a 1 @-@ bedroom apartment in montauk ?
you &apos;re spying on my laptop ?
don &apos;t change the subject .
declan and i were looking for a place .
thought we &apos;d put your $ 25,000 bribe to good use .
that &apos;s right , mom .
i know you were trying to pay him off
only you couldn &apos;t ,
because he really cares about me .
i &apos;m sure he does .
and i &apos;m sure that you think you feel the same way , too ,
but believe me , this is an insanely bad idea .
what about school ? what about--
relax , mom . i &apos;m not ... moving in with declan .
it wouldn &apos;t be fair to him .
fair to him ?
because all i really want is to get away from you .
i &apos;m 17 , mom ,
and dad said it &apos;s pretty much up to me
who i want to live with .
well , guess what .
i choose dad .
how are the plans for our monte carlo getaway coming along ?
on hold , i &apos;m afraid .
really ?
and why is that ?
well , because there &apos;s no longer any reason to celebrate .
i &apos;m sorry , ty .
i &apos;m pulling my investment .
uh , i &apos;m having too many second thoughts .
you &apos;ve been playing me this whole time .
setting me up to fail .
let &apos;s not mix business and pleasure .
oh , funny coming from the guy who videotaped
that sickening encounter .
excuse me ?
i have to say , i &apos;m shocked that you would expose yourself
to conrad grayson just to ruin me .
i underestimated you , but then ...
you underestimated me , too .
i only made that tape as insurance
because i didn &apos;t trust you .
so , tyler , how much is it gonna cost for me to get it back ?
well , nolan , you do not want to play games with me .
you know i don &apos;t have it ,
so where is it ? ! show me !
shh , shh , ty , ty , stop .
i can &apos;t believe you really did this .
i didn &apos;t give this to conrad grayson . i swear .
yeah , right . then who did ?
you stupid ... son of a bitch .
wait , wait . wait .
ty !
we could &apos;ve been a good team .
now you &apos;re just as lonely and pathetic
as the day i found you .
surprise .
you did not do all this for me .
who else ?
something wrong ?
i wanted to surprise you , too ,
so ... i looked for the sea glass we buried ,
but ... i couldn &apos;t find it anywhere .
i guess my memory sucks after all .
your memory is perfect .
where &apos;d you find that ?
right where you left it .
i dug it up the day after
social services took you away
and i &apos;ve kept it eve since .
that is so ... incredible .
and now you &apos;ve come back for it ,
just like you said you would .
among other things .
sammy ?
you .
something &apos;s upsetting you .
i hope it &apos;s not my swordfish .
no , no , the dinner was perfect .
but i ...
i think i should go home .
why ?
there &apos;s something about the way tyler was acting today .
i just want to make sure he leaves town
without torching the place .
but thank you for dinner .
you &apos;re welcome .
i &apos;m sorry you have to deal with all of this .
oh , it &apos;s all right , as long as i still
got you at the end of the day .
you &apos;re in love with him .
of course i &apos;m not .
when you came to me ,
you were just a little girl ...
so much rage ,
so much betrayal .
i did not want to train you
because ... your emotions ...
destined you to fail .
i &apos;m not that girl anymore .
i &apos;ve separated myself from my emotions .
then you are lying .
i would never lie to you .
then you lie even to yourself .
i can do nothing more to help you .
please .
don &apos;t abandon me .
the decision was yours .
you are on your own .
how does this sound ?
the graysons are incredibly powerful , your honor .
i was intimidated into helping them frame david clarke
and then threatened by their head of security
if i didn &apos;t comply .
the prosecution rests .
mom ?
you okay ?
charlotte &apos;s gone .
she went to go live with your father .
i &apos;m sorry . i ...
listen , you know her .
she &apos;ll cool off and come home eventually .
well , this mausoleum is too cold and empty
to be called a home .
i &apos;m afraid i &apos;ve given everyone in this family
a reason to desert me .
well , i &apos;m still here for you .
thank you for checking up on me .
of course .
i also wanted to make sure tyler had left without a fuss .
well , you just missed him .
he went to dinner a few minutes ago .
wait . tyler &apos;s still staying here ?
yes , as far as i know .
daniel .
dad , what happened to tyler when you fired him ?
actually ... i didn &apos;t have to fire him .
we , uh , settled the matter .
what the hell does that mean ?
it means i don &apos;t have to explain myself to you , daniel .
this is about business .
business ?
what about ethics and integrity ?
well , he promised to resolve
the situation with nolan discreetly .
and you believed him ?
this is not your call , daniel .
daniel ?
charlotte .
daddy , i can &apos;t live with her anymore .
oh , sweetheart . come here .
it &apos;s okay .
this seat taken ?
it &apos;s for you .
you made it just under the wire .
well , i guess it &apos;s my lucky night .
no .
somehow i think it &apos;s mine .
he makes it so easy for me to hate him .
how did you stay with him all these years ?
that &apos;s a complicated question , daniel .
and i don &apos;t want to turn you against your father .
oh , don &apos;t worry . he &apos;s doing it all by himself .
i &apos;ve hired a lawyer , daniel .
it might get ugly .
and i don &apos;t want to cost you your position in the company .
don &apos;t worry . i &apos;m staying with the company .
i &apos;ll have access to dad &apos;s business accounts ,
bank records .
whatever you need , i &apos;ll get it .
as far as i &apos;m concerned , whatever you want
in this divorce is yours .
i think i &apos;m gonna stay here tonight ,
keep an eye on things .
thank you .
you crossed the line , emily .
how could you do that to me ?
if you mean that recording of you and tyler ,
you &apos;ll thank me one day . i did you a favor .
but i trusted you .
you can &apos;t build trust on secrets , nolan .
you should know that by now .
oh , you &apos;re one to talk--
holding back on me about amanda , god knows what else .
you have been trying to derail me since day one--
toying with jack &apos;s heart ,
buying his boat .
and now you sabotaged our alliance
because you fell for a hooker .
the difference is ,
that when i had an opportunity to expose you today ,
i didn &apos;t .
well , maybe that &apos;s because , deep down inside ,
you know i meant it when i said
that i would take you down if you tried to get in my way .
message received .
i &apos;m done playing your evil games .
i never asked you to be a part of this .
no .
your father did .
ems , he didn &apos;t want this for you .
remember ?
it &apos;s good that he &apos;s gone .
&apos;cause at least now he can &apos;t see what you &apos;ve become .
hey , uh , did i just see nolan leaving your place ?
yeah , um ...
he had a pretty scary visit from tyler .
he thinks nolan got him fired .
well , that &apos;s just it . my father didn &apos;t fire him .
really ?
do you have any idea why ?
who knows ?
i &apos;ve just had enough of my father &apos;s lies .
listen , are you okay with me staying with my mom tonight ?
if and when tyler shows up ,
i don &apos;t want her here alone .
yeah , that &apos;s probably a great idea .
i mean , you &apos;re welcome to come over , too , if you like .
got a great view of your porch from up here
in case amanda clarke comes digging around again .
i can handle amanda .
you just look after your mom .
ah , she &apos;ll be all right .
she hired a lawyer today .
that &apos;s great .
sleep tight .
night .
did i hear you say amanda clarke ?
yeah , she &apos;s back in town after all this time .
strange , right ?
my father wrote ,
&quot; always question where your loyalties lie .
the people you trust will expect it ,
your greatest enemies will desire it ,
and those you treasure the most ,
will , without fail , abuse it . &quot;
&quot; dear mr. clarke ,
i am writing to inform you
that i will not be moving forward
with the appeal of your conviction for the crime of treason . &quot;
ryan huntley .
who are you ?
amanda clarke .
how did you get in here ?
that &apos;s the least of your problems right now .
i want to know why you dropped my father &apos;s appeal .
some say loyalty inspires boundless hope .
and while that may be , there is a catch .
true loyalty takes years to build ...
