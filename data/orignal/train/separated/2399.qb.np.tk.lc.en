mystic falls ... i was born here .
this is my home .
and mine .
and mine .
for centuries , supernatural creatures have lived among us .
they were vampires , werewolves , doppelgangers ...
witches .
and even hybrids .
i &apos;m one of them now--a vampire ,
and everything i used to feel has changed .
feelings for him have been magnified .
i can &apos;t do this , elena--not anymore .
i know .
her brother is the key to finding the cure .
i call this a hunter &apos;s mark .
the more i kill , the more it grows .
it &apos;s invisible to anyone but another hunter .
and i will stop at nothing ...
to make her human again .
what do you mean , you &apos;re not coming ?
i don &apos;t need to remind you
that your miss mystic falls attendance record totally sucks .
besides , you &apos;re a founding family member .
by definition , you have to be here .
elena and i broke up .
by definition , i don &apos;t need to be anywhere .
did that sound as depressing to you as it did to me ?
i &apos;m not depressed .
i just want to rip into someone &apos;s artery
and feed until i can &apos;t breathe anymore .
you can &apos;t . as your sober sponsor ,
i &apos;m not going to let that happen .
try and sublimate .
she said she has feelings for damon .
what ?
she can &apos;t have feelings for damon .
he &apos;s ... damon ,
and you &apos;re you , and i &apos;m ...
revolted .
you know , i &apos;m gonna talk to her .
i &apos;m going to shake some sense into her clearly diseased brain .
yeah , well , i don &apos;t know what good that &apos;ll do .
elena &apos;s right .
being a vampire really has changed her .
all the more reason you need to cure her .
look , i got to go .
be careful and remember ,
there &apos;s sublimating and then there &apos;s insanity .
i &apos;ll be fine . bye .
in what world do the words &quot; tell no one &quot; mean
&quot; tell your brother and every teenage sycophant in town &quot; ?
the secret &apos;s safe .
no one who knows about the cure would endanger us .
trust me . you know i want to find it more than anyone else .
then i suggest you find some vampires for jeremy to kill
before i &apos;m tempted to offer you up as a victim .
and try to keep this one to yourself , would you ?
where have you been ?
you know . out .
where you going ?
out .
ok . i see shady stefan is back .
please don &apos;t tell me that you &apos;re still working with klaus .
you obviously haven &apos;t heard .
elena and i broke up .
got it . i &apos;ll be quick , then .
so apparently if we want to find the cure ,
we have to find a vampire hunter
who can kill enough vampires
to reveal the map on the hunter &apos;s mark .
now , unless we want jeremy to go all connor 2.0,
i suggest we find a different hunter .
ok . and ?
and i was gonna ask professor shane ,
but it turns out he &apos;s shadier than you are .
matt donovan connected him and the pastor
through phone records .
apparently the two were very chatty
the day that the pastor blew up the council .
so you &apos;re gonna confront shane ,
threaten him , possibly kill him-- that sort of thing ?
yeah , unless he tells me what he &apos;s up to .
what do you say ?
we tag team ?
nah .
i &apos;d say you &apos;re on your own .
or we could just blow it off , then--
go get drunk ,
brother @-@ bond over some tridelts
if you ...
you know , want some quality time .
let &apos;s not pretend like this isn &apos;t the best day
of your life .
i &apos;m your best friend , and i would never pick sides ,
but are you sure that this is what you want ?
because stefan is your soul mate .
sorry . picking sides .
it &apos;s not like i don &apos;t love stefan anymore ,
but i can &apos;t deny that ever since i turned ,
my feelings for damon have become more intense .
yeah , i know . stefan filled me in
on all the gory damon details .
he did ?
is he ok ?
no . he &apos;s heartbroken .
well , what was i supposed to do ? lie to him ?
no , but you weren &apos;t supposed to let damon
weasel his way into your confused newbie vampire heart .
well , he did , and that &apos;s exactly what i am--confused .
i need to figure out what these feelings actually mean .
excuse me . i &apos;m a little lost .
i &apos;m here to interview contestants .
you &apos;re professor shane ?
yeah , that &apos;s right-- professor by day ,
pageant judge by other day .
in spite of being absurdly unqualified ,
i &apos;m apparently awarding a scholarship .
inside by the parlor .
right here ?
all right . i &apos;ll just follow the scent
of hair spray and world domination .
he &apos;s the one who told damon
how to break the hunter &apos;s curse .
he &apos;s also the one that has bonnie so obsessed
with practicing magic
that she bailed on pageant prep .
and now he &apos;s judging miss mystic falls ?
jack of all trades or kind of creepy ?
so your sister &apos;s making me be her date .
do i have to do that weird dance thing ?
i &apos;m pretty sure that &apos;s just for the contestants .
i heard that you &apos;re april &apos;s escort . how &apos;d that happen ?
she needed a date , and apparently you were taken .
uh . ok , let &apos;s just take these ,
and we &apos;ll come back for the kegs .
wait .
you want to see something cool ?
how did you just do that ?
ever since i was &quot; awoken &quot; as a hunter ,
i &apos;ve had all this energy , like all the time .
jer , i think you need to talk to someone about this .
i mean , look what happened to connor , ok ?
a by @-@ product of this energy
is that you &apos;re gonna want to kill vampires ,
and you happen to live with one .
hey , i would never hurt my sister .
i &apos;ll be fine .
心脏搭桥并发症
can i help you ?
time for a little break .
he &apos;ll be safe with me .
who are you ?
why is there a cop outside ?
i &apos;m a convicted murderer .
are you guilty ?
of course i am .
any regrets ?
only that i got caught .
whoa . stop . stop .
those flowers go in the back ,
as indicated by the floral chart
that you guys had plenty of time to memorize .
yeah . thank you .
now , how did i know i &apos;d find you at the helm of this ship ?
go away . i &apos;m busy .
i was wondering what time i should pick you up tomorrow .
about a quarter to never .
i was promised a date
in return for one of my hybrids .
yes , a date , like to a movie ,
where we don &apos;t have to talk
and i can put at least 3 seats between us .
surely the reigning miss mystic falls
won &apos;t be hosting the party alone .
and i assume you &apos;re not taking tyler--
not after his indiscretions
with his lady werewolf friend .
fine . if you insist on coming ,
meet me here , 2 p.m. black tie optional .
and i already have a dress ,
so don &apos;t even think of getting me so much as a corsage .
you understand ?
i &apos;ll see you tomorrow , caroline .
scream . let it out . we &apos;re on an abandoned farm .
no one can hear you for miles .
easy for you to say , wolf girl .
you never turned 20 times in a row .
no , but i watched a bunch of your hybrid friends go through it .
why does it have to be like this ?
uhh ! why break every bone over and over ?
that &apos;s what the sire bond is .
you &apos;re grateful to klaus because he released you
from the pain of having to turn every full moon .
so you &apos;re gonna keep turning until it doesn &apos;t hurt .
then you &apos;ll have nothing to be grateful for .
uh ! what &apos;s in all this for you ?
i don &apos;t hear bones cracking .
caroline bought us another day .
klaus wants to go with her to miss mystic falls tomorrow .
so does that mean we &apos;re going ?
watching klaus fawn over caroline
at some lame @-@ ass pageant ?
no , thanks .
come on .
we need to hide what &apos;s going on here
by pretending that i was the one
that broke you two up ,
and besides , isn &apos;t it at your house ?
guys , like this isn &apos;t torture enough ?
can you take it outside ?
fine . we &apos;ll go .
wear a dress .
you need a hand ?
yeah . please . this clasp is tricky .
hey , i , uh , picked up your clothes
from the dry cleaners .
they should be hanging on your door .
i really wish you &apos;d stop acting
like you were still my sister .
how do you wake up with a knife in your hand
and not remember how it got there ?
it &apos;s that hunter &apos;s mark , jer .
it &apos;s messing with you .
what if i &apos;m turning into alaric ?
i probably died too many times with this ring on my finger ,
and i &apos;m developing an alter ego , like he did .
&quot; newly awakened hunters may not be fully conscious
of their actions . &quot;
&quot; their subconscious pushes through
until the urge becomes a basic instinct . &quot;
you &apos;re not having a psychotic break , jer .
you either tell elena , or i will .
fine .
i &apos;ll tell her when i see her .
all right . we should probably get going .
need a ride ?
uh , no . go ahead . i &apos;ll meet you there .
all right .
blue .
blue .
really ? the blue seems a little safe .
safe is good when it comes to the judges .
she &apos;s right .
gracie lockwood had a 3 @-@ foot slit her year
and practically got laughed off the court .
she got my vote .
get out , lurker .
ouch .
where &apos;s professor shane ?
check the judges &apos; table .
red one , definitely .
we &apos;ve already agreed that the red one &apos;s a little bit too showy .
it &apos;s a pageant . that &apos;s the whole point .
did you win miss mystic last year ?
no . i don &apos;t think you did .
neither did elena , and she wore blue .
nobody cares what you think .
i care .
see ? april cares .
red , right , elena ?
the red is pretty .
and my work here is done .
uh , what happened to 30 seconds ago
when you hated the red one ?
what happened to &quot; safe is good &quot; ?
whichever one you want to wear , april .
what just happened ?
damon .
still here .
we need to talk .
stefan told me about the breakup .
i &apos;d say i &apos;m sorry , but i &apos;m not .
what did he say ?
oh , you know stefan .
the guy just went on and on about it . wouldn &apos;t shut up .
so he didn &apos;t tell you why ?
nope , but i &apos;m sure it has something to do
with you acting weird , so why don &apos;t you tell me ?
you .
damon salvatore .
looks like we &apos;re traveling the same circuit .
professor shane .
just the guy i wanted to see .
so i &apos;m in search of another hunter .
hunter with a capital &quot; h &quot; ? why ?
same reason anyone needs a hunter ...
loneliness , drinking buddy , fourth for golf .
i thought you said you already had a potential .
i did , but he ended up being potentially a problem , so ...
there &apos;s nothing i can do to help you .
well , why don &apos;t you help me with this ?
why are you here ?
what &apos;s in your little lesson plan there , professor ?
you think too highly of me , damon .
i &apos;m gonna go find the other judges .
hey , no pity votes for april young , ok ?
i mean , just because her dad blew up a house
with a dozen people in it doesn &apos;t mean
she should get a tiara .
but you knew him , didn &apos;t you ?
because i hear you two racked up
a pretty impressive phone bill .
if you want to know something about me , damon , just ask .
ok .
how did you convince the pastor to kill all those people ?
did you just accuse me of mass murder
in the middle of a high school pageant ?
welcome to this season &apos;s
miss mystic falls .
we are so excited to showcase
our most outstanding community leaders in the making .
what am i doing here ?
getting the chance to make your sister human again .
you interested ?
you have no idea .
actually , i do .
who is that ?
oh , it doesn &apos;t really matter .
all that matters is that you &apos;re a vampire hunter
and he &apos;s a vampire .
well , almost .
was this all so i could stake him ?
do you think i want to do this , jeremy ? look at me .
i hate this . i don &apos;t want to do this , but your sister
isn &apos;t supposed to be a vampire ,
and we need to help her .
he &apos;s a murderer ,
and he will gladly kill again ,
so do it , jeremy .
kill him .
stefan , what are you doing ? !
what the hell is wrong with you ?
do it , jeremy , or i will rip the chains off for real .
do it !
all right , enough . he &apos;s dead .
hey , why am i bussing your tables ?
i said no empty glasses .
will you guys pick up the tempo ?
this is a pageant , not a funeral .
and how am i doing ?
you &apos;re ...
perfect .
just so beyond annoying ,
i can &apos;t even look at you .
they didn &apos;t waste any time , did they ?
let &apos;s just get today over with .
i can &apos;t believe that i won .
i just want to thank the judges
for seeing past the fact that i &apos;m a raging bitch .
you don &apos;t want to do that .
those girls will cut you .
they have nails .
i have claws .
hi , everyone . i &apos;m caroline forbes .
as the reigning miss mystic falls ,
it is my honor to introduce
this year &apos;s miss mystic court !
we begin the procession with valerie fell ,
accompanied by dylan clark .
next we have amber wolverton ,
accompanied by hector linsey .
and here &apos;s michelle cunningham ...
have you seen jeremy ?
he &apos;s probably with the escorts .
caroline told me to wrangle the escorts .
he &apos;s not here .
brianna johnson , accompanied by ...
did he tell you about his nightmares ?
what nightmares ?
the ones where he kills you .
katherine wilson , accompanied by eric hanson .
i &apos;ll find him , but ...
april &apos;s about to get abandoned .
i got this .
and finally ...
thanks .
we have a last @-@ minute entry--april young ,
accompanied by jeremy gilbert .
jeremy &apos;s running late .
i guess you &apos;ll do .
you lead .
hey , what &apos;s with the last @-@ minute escort change ?
where is jeremy ?
i &apos;m calling him right now .
he &apos;s not picking up .
do the math . emo teen .
open bar . it &apos;s fine .
matt said that jeremy &apos;s been having nightmares
about killing vampires
and he &apos;s been hiding it from me .
relax . i &apos;m sure he &apos;s fine .
i don &apos;t know . i have a bad feeling .
if i &apos;m not worried , you shouldn &apos;t be worried .
let it go .
i &apos;ll go look for him .
ok .
ok . you go home .
i &apos;m gonna start asking around here .
maybe damon &apos;s right .
maybe he grabbed a bottle from the bar
and snuck off to the woods .
no . damon &apos;s never right .
damon is sneaky and manipulative and rude ,
but he &apos;s never right .
how can you not see that ?
i don &apos;t know , but why do i think
that you won &apos;t hesitate to tell me ?
fine . friend @-@ tervention .
i think your so @-@ called feelings for damon
are really starting to cloud your judgment ,
and i don &apos;t like it ,
and the thought of you two together
really makes me want to barf .
easy , love . you &apos;re making a scene .
wow . caroline , thank you
for making this very difficult time so much easier .
how did i become the bad guy ?
let &apos;s get you a drink .
i &apos;ll tell you all about being the bad guy .
please don &apos;t tell me
that you &apos;ve roped jeremy into a world of crazy .
i had no choice .
elena needs a cure .
oh , right . so you can turn her back into
the girl who &apos;s still in love with you .
you know , i get why you wouldn &apos;t
want to believe it , damon ,
but she isn &apos;t herself anymore .
of course you would think that .
leave it alone , stefan .
how far did the mark grow ?
show me on this drawing .
sorry , stefan . i can &apos;t trust you .
how far is it , jeremy ?
i said i can &apos;t .
answer me , or i will make you answer me .
i &apos;m not telling you anything .
what does the mark look like ?
i guess i can &apos;t be compelled anymore .
it &apos;s just , as her best friend ,
it is my duty to warn her
when she &apos;s making a giant mistake , right ?
and now she &apos;s taking damon &apos;s side on everything .
so being a vampire has changed her .
but being a vampire only amplifies who you already are .
it doesn &apos;t turn you into a completely different person .
very peculiar .
what &apos;s that look for ?
it &apos;ll all make sense eventually .
whatever . just hurry up and find the cure .
i &apos;m working on it .
would you ever take it ?
now , why would i want to cure myself
of being the most powerful creature
on the planet , hmm ?
so there &apos;s not one single moment
in your whole life that you wanted to be human .
how about you ?
life used to be a lot easier .
don &apos;t you miss the days of being ...
&quot; chair of the mystic falls beautification committee &quot;
and the &quot; director of the policemen &apos;s yearly raffle &quot; ?
is that my miss mystic application ?
where did you get that ?
&quot; when i am chosen ,
i intend to redefine excellence ... &quot;
now , i &apos;m really enjoying your use of &quot; when &quot; here .
it &apos;s very confident .
&quot; and above all , i promise to aspire ,
inspire , and perspire . &quot;
obviously , we found a shortage of words ending in &quot; spire . &quot;
yeah . it &apos;s very funny . it &apos;s hilarious . just--
don &apos;t .
how do those two know each other ?
they don &apos;t .
paranoid much ?
the council just got burned to a crisp .
some mysterious hunters just blew through town ,
and this guy just happens to know
everything about everything .
yes , paranoid .
where have you been ?
sorry . i got stuck at work .
jeremy , if you were too chicken to do the dance thingy ,
then you should &apos;ve just told me .
no , no . i knew the dance .
i watched some lesson online ,
like , 100 times .
you did ?
hey , what &apos;s that shane guy doing here ?
he &apos;s a judge .
i talked to him about my dad .
i mean , he said that he never seemed depressed
or suicidal or anything , so--
your dad ?
yeah .
you know , i figured i &apos;d explore every possibility ,
even the bleak ones .
what are you looking at ?
your dad was doing the right thing for this town .
the whole council was . they died heroes .
oh , you again .
i must be the least intimidating mass murderer ever .
well , you still never gave me a name ,
and it &apos;s kind of urgent .
listen . there is no other name . look .
at any given moment , there are 5 hunters in existence , all right ?
most of them have no idea who they are
or what their purpose is .
means finding more than one in a lifetime
is next to impossible .
subtle .
like you didn &apos;t already know .
you have 5 seconds to give me another name ,
or you die .
you know , since it &apos;s generally unwise
for a vampire to seek out a hunter ,
it means you &apos;re interested in the mark .
that &apos;s probably because of where it leads ,
but here &apos;s the thing .
even if you complete the mark
and you get the map ,
the thing that you &apos;re looking for
is sealed with a spell only a certain kind
of witch can perform .
what kind of witch ?
come on , damon .
i love pressure points . what kind of witch ?
come on . you &apos;re a big boy .
you can figure this one out .
a bennett witch .
aren &apos;t too many of those lying around ,
as i &apos;m sure you know .
so none of this matters until bonnie
is back in touch with her magic .
between the two of us , who do you think
she trusts to help her get there ?
5 seconds are up
unless you just realized you need me alive .
now , if you &apos;ll excuse me ,
i have a scholarship to award .
and now the moment you &apos;ve been waiting for .
caroline , would you do the honors ?
this year &apos;s miss mystic falls is ...
april young .
jeremy .
hey , where have you been ?
what are you doing with that ?
put it down .
connor was right .
all i can think about is killing vampires .
you &apos;re nothing like connor .
i want to believe that ,
and i know i don &apos;t want to hurt you ,
but everything inside of me is telling me
to drive this stake through your heart .
why would you say that ?
it &apos;s me , jeremy .
and you &apos;re a vampire .
yeah , but i &apos;m also your sister .
jer ...
i would never do anything to hurt you .
no .
get it away from me .
jere-- jeremy .
jer , wake up . please wake up .
jeremy !
get out of here , matt .
jeremy , you don &apos;t want to do this , ok ?
that &apos;s your sister .
it &apos;s that stupid mark on your arm .
shut up , matt !
jeremy , look at me .
i &apos;m human , and i &apos;m telling you
not to hurt her .
get out of here , matt !
come on , let &apos;s get out of here .
let me do it . let me do it . let me do it .
your mom parties harder than you do .
does she have the gene ?
dad .
what about your parents ?
never met them .
my adoptive parents found out
about my wolf gene when i did ,
the night that i turned
and tore apart their living room .
promptly kicked me out .
you never told me how it triggered .
you mean , who i killed ?
boating accident .
we were drunk . i thought i wasn &apos;t .
so what &apos;s with you
chatting up all these old @-@ timers , huh--
my mom , that professor guy .
that professor guy is , like , 30,
and he &apos;s hot and smart .
you know him or something ?
no . i just met him . why ?
no reason .
i never answered your question ,
if i &apos;d ever thought about being human .
once .
i was on a trek in the andes ,
and a hummingbird flew up to me
and just hovered there staring at me .
its tiny heart was pattering like a machine gun ...
and i thought , &quot; what a thing , you know ,
to have to work that hard every day
just to stay alive ,
to be constantly on the verge of death ,
and how satisfying every day must be
that it survived ... &quot;
and that was the only time
i thought about being human .
what &apos;s he saying ?
a bunch of bs about being human .
the sooner we get rid of this guy , the better .
elena , wait .
i have to find jeremy .
this shouldn &apos;t be happening to him .
elena , wait . it &apos;s my fault .
what are you talking about ?
i &apos;m starting to think that when a hunter
kills a vampire , their urge
to keep killing grows stronger .
tell me that jeremy hasn &apos;t been with you
this entire time .
tell me that you haven &apos;t been making him
kill vampires , stefan .
we need the map to get the cure .
if getting my humanity back means stripping jeremy of his ,
then i don &apos;t want the cure .
he &apos;s the only way to fix all of this .
you mean me ,
the only way to fix me .
you don &apos;t have to love me like this .
this is who i am now .
the old elena died when she went off that bridge .
let her go .
what are you doing ?
i can &apos;t keep living here
if i want to kill my sister .
elena knows that .
that &apos;s why she moved out and asked me to move in .
what ?
look .
i &apos;m not one of them , jer .
i &apos;ll keep an eye on you ,
and we can keep this hunter business in check .
where &apos;s elena gonna go ?
i can &apos;t stay at home anymore .
pick a room .
i &apos;ll crash somewhere else .
tell me it &apos;s over , ty .
i really don &apos;t think i can do this anymore .
it &apos;s over . nice work .
we are one step closer to ending this .
we got another one .
good .
we &apos;re almost ready .
i want to leave tyler out of this when it all goes down .
we &apos;ll talk when you &apos;ve broken the last one .
thanks .
just being polite .
thought you hated whiskey .
my brother wants to kill me .
welcome to the club .
jeremy can &apos;t live with me ,
stefan wants to fix me ,
and caroline flat out admitted
that she doesn &apos;t like me this way .
think it &apos;s safe to say
that i &apos;m not so great at this vampire thing .
you want to know what i think ?
i don &apos;t think i &apos;ve ever seen you more alive .
that dance that they did today
kind of reminded me of when--
when we danced together ?
i wanted to dance with you today .
elena is right . i just need to let go .
no . you &apos;re right , stefan .
it &apos;s not pretty , and it &apos;s not easy ,
but you can &apos;t give up on her .
caroline , she looked me in the eye ,
and she told me to move on .
she &apos;s lost , ok ?
you and her--epic .
her and damon-- ugh , god .
there &apos;s something wrong with her .
just promise me you won &apos;t stop looking for the cure .
klaus won &apos;t let me , even if i wanted to .
what does he care ? he doesn &apos;t even want it .
he wants to keep elena human
so that he can make more hybrids .
he &apos;s gonna need them .
tyler has almost got all of them unsired .
oh , my god .
my ...
god .
i was trying to understand why klaus was so intrigued
by damon and elena .
he said i would figure it out .
this is what he was talking about .
what are you talking about ?
think about it .
every time elena has had a problem ,
damon has been the magic solution .
today elena was worried about jeremy .
who swoops in and tells her to relax ?
damon , and she listens .
when elena started feeding , who said that she could only
drink blood straight from the vein ?
damon .
and when she tried to drink from animals ?
couldn &apos;t keep it down .
and blood bags ?
same thing .
name one vampire in the history of vampires
who couldn &apos;t drink blood from a blood bag .
damon said she couldn &apos;t , so she couldn &apos;t .
damon likes the red dress , elena likes the red dress .
damon says kill connor , she kills connor .
what if it &apos;s possible ?
damon &apos;s blood made her a vampire , right ?
it &apos;s rare , but it happens .
what if this is one of those times ?
what if this is really happening ?
