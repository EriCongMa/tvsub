i &apos;m excited ! i &apos;ve never been reviewed before !
you were so amazing as the king ! i &apos;m really impressed .
but you know what ?
you might wanna wear underwear next time .
when you sat on the throne , you could see your ...
... royal subjects .
no one wore underwear back then .
i &apos; m sure the critics appreciated your authenticity .
nice genitals , by the way .
thanks , man .
here it is ! here it is !
&quot; the only thing worse than the mindless adolescent direction ...

all right ? pheebs , read yours .
&quot; the only thing worse than the mindless , adolescent direction &quot;
anybody have a different paper ?
ross , read yours .

&quot; the one enjoyable moment is when the king is beheaded and speaks no more . &quot;

i &apos;ve done this 10 years and i &apos;m nowhere . there &apos;s gotta be a reason .
come on , you &apos;re just paying your dues .
no , no , no . it &apos;s too hard .
it &apos;s not worth it . i quit .
come on , joey !
wait , wait one minute . wait a minute .
i believe this will change your mind .

fun bobby is so great .
oh , isn &apos;t he ?
i think this time it may work with him . he makes me feel so good .
i &apos;ve been feeling so lousy lately . no job , no boyfriend .
well , at least my cup is half full .
half full of love !
for our two @-@ week anniversary , he &apos;s taking me to his cousin &apos;s cabin .
cabin of love !
we went through a lot of wine tonight .
i only had two glasses .
i had a glass .
two .
i had one glass .
i had a mug full in this ...
... i @-@ got @-@ boned @-@ at @-@ the- museum @-@ of @-@ natural @-@ history mug .
okay , so that &apos;s what ? two bottles .
and yet somehow we went through five ?
so what ? so he drank a lot tonight .
now that i think about it , i don &apos;t think ...
... i &apos;ve ever seen fun bobby without a drink .
and did you notice how he always starts his stories with ...
... &quot; okay , i was so wasted ! &quot; or &quot; oh , we were so bombed ! &quot;
&quot; so i wake up and i &apos;m in this dumpster in connecticut ! &quot;
have you been with him when he wasn &apos;t drinking ?
we just happen to go to a lot of places where you might drink .
how do you go to a wine @-@ tasting without having a drink ?
or to a club , or to the ...
... zoo .
rach , does this have nonfat milk ?
i don &apos;t know , taste it .
too late , you already had some .
what do you say we make these coffees lrish ?
cake !
yeah , we &apos;re gonna get some cake .
it seems like you &apos;ve been making an awful lot of stuff &quot; lrish &quot; lately .
i &apos;d make them belgian , but the waffles are hard to get into that flask .
yeah , okay .
maybe it &apos;s none of my business . or maybe it is , i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m worried about you .
this isn &apos;t the first time somebody said something to me about this .
but i always made excuses , like &quot; i &apos;m just a social drinker . &quot;
or &quot; come on , it &apos;s flag day ! &quot;
so , what are you saying now ?
i guess i &apos;m saying ...
... i &apos;ll try and quit .
i like that you worry about me .
so , what &apos;s going on ?
i am gonna try and quit drinking .
oh ! why ?
guess who &apos;s back in show biz !
lorne greene ?
no . you know why ? because he &apos;s dead .
oh , no .
this is gonna seem bittersweet now ...
... but joey , that &apos;s who !
my agent called with an audition for days of our lives !
kick ass !
here &apos;s to joey !
here joey !
we have to celebrate ! we should do a soap opera theme .
