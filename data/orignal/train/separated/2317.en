Mystic Falls... I was born here.
This is my home.
And mine.
And mine.
For centuries, supernatural creatures have lived among us.
They were vampires, werewolves, doppelgangers...
witches.
And even hybrids.
Then there's Elena. She's one of us now.
You're a vampire now...
You just have to learn the right way to be one.
And I'm gonna teach you.
Now there's a hunter in town, determined to kill us all.
There's more to you than meets the eye, isn't there?
And only I know his secret.
You're one of the five.
So what is all this?
Some personal items that I snaked
from the vampire hunter's RV.
May he rest in peace.
I'm searching for a supernatural handbook.
You know for a fact he was supernatural?
Definitely wasn't natural.
The guy magically appears just as someone
blows up the entire founders' council,
covered in a tattoo that only Jeremy Gilbert,
of all people in the world,
seems to be able to see.
Klaus mentioned something about him being one of the five.
And then he kamikazes himself with explosives.
Seem natural to you?
What's the five?
That's what I'm hoping is in the first chapter of the handbook.
Liz Forbes, my favorite sheriff.
What?
That's...concerning.
Keep me posted.
What, you're not going to tell me?
I can't tell you. It's private. We're in a fight.
You're in a fight, I'm not in a fight.
I'm over it. I've been over it.
You're not still mad at me about Elena?
You let her feed on you. I'm always going to be mad at you.
But we're not in a fight.
Very well, then.
They didn't find any remains at the explosion site.
So Connor's still out there.
Apparently so.
I'm going to need you to get on this today.
I have to take Elena to college.
I'm sorry, you have to do what, exactly?
I'm teaching her how to feed.
She needs to learn snatch, eat,
erase now more than ever.
We're not in a fight, remember?
I know it's crazy,
but I almost killed Matt last night.
Damon had to rip me off of him
and then compel him to forget.
Call it doppelganger curse or whatever,
but I can't drink animal blood.
I can't drink from a blood bag.
I can only drink from the vein.
A little slow. Almost got you.
That's why we're not using the wood ones
for hunter defense class.
What about Caroline?
She's a genius at self control.
She's too good.
She doesn't understand how hard it is.
And you, well, I know what being around
too much blood does to you, so...
I can't put you through that.
So I guess that leaves Damon, huh?
Don't be jealous. You know I wish it could be you.
Fine. You wish it could be me.
We're crashing Bonnie's trip to Whitmore college.
The professor that took over her gram's classes?
He invited her.
Listen to me.
You're the one who's getting me through this.
No matter who teaches me how to feed.
OK.
Just be careful, ok?
The blood, the feed...
It's easy to get caught up in it.
I will.
I promise.
What's that?
The key to your new truck.
It's parked outside, paid for, insured,
everything but a big red bow.
If that's your idea of an apology...
You should probably give it to Elena.
She's the one you killed.
You're trying too hard.
Last I heard, you were leaving town--forever.
Well, I was.
But then I thought to myself, how can I when my sister,
clearly so desperate for love and affection,
is left here...
bribing the help.
What do you want, Nik?
I thought I was dead to you.
Things change, Rebekah.
I've stumbled upon something I think might be of interest to you.
Doubt that.
No? Well, what if I told you
the brotherhood of the five still existed?
What?
You see?
And like that, bygones.
Come on, love. Work to do.
We don't have anything to do.
There is no "We."
I don't care about the five,
and I don't care about you.
As you wish.
You're ok with this?
If I could spell you out of wanting blood, I would.
But I can't, so better you doing this now
than at freshman orientation.
Something tells me that college isn't in my future anymore.
Oh, stop with the pity party.
If I can go to college, you can go to college.
You? Went to college?
Sure. Plenty of times.
I always had a thing for sorority girls.
You're disgusting.
I know.
When I say the word "Witch,"
what pops into your head?
Halloween costume?
Villain of a fairy tale?
Maybe an ex-girlfriend? Well, whatever image it is,
it's probably not tanielle soso...
Is that him?
Yeah.
He's kind of...
Hot.
I'm an admittedly crappy photographer.
Now, in reality,
or in this reality, at least,
witches have appeared across every culture in history.
They're the architects of the supernatural.
Responsible for everything that goes bump in the night,
from ghosts to vampires
to doppelgangers...
What is this guy, witchipedia?
Shh, shut up.
Now, if you're a skeptic, you'd call that a coincidence.
But if you're a true believer...
You know what, there really isn't such thing.
What if I'm... a ripper?
You're not a ripper.
What if I am?
Well, then, pick someone and we'll find out.
Stoner guys are no good to grab. They're too paranoid
and you don't want the extra buzz.
Now, she is fun-sized.
But too alert. Geeky girls are inherently suspicious
of anyone who's nice to them.
What you want is the little blonde, pretty girl.
Self absorbed, easily flattered.
You just have to separate her from the pack
and make your move.
Am I interrupting you guys?
Or is it maybe the other way around?
Sorry.
I was just saying how much I love witches.
Yeah, you and me both, brother.
All right, listen, we should probably talk about
the readings that none of you did.
Looks like I'll have to beef up the hybrid security detail.
I was going to take him,
but I figured you went through
such trouble to truss him up
in your red room of pain.
It's from the inquisition.
I thought it was a nice touch.
What'd you get out of him?
Not enough.
He's mum about the council fire
and he's not saying anything about this greater evil
we're all supposed to be shivering over.
What brings you snooping?
Well, I can't say it in front of him.
As I'm sure you've figured out,
our friend here can't be compelled.
You're full of mysteries, aren't you?
I told you, I don't know anything.
Thankfully, I know plenty.
Shall we?
So what's with the home invasion?
Damon said you knew something about this guy.
I should have figured you were up to something
when you healed Elena from the werewolf poison
without asking for anything in return.
I was feeling benevolent.
You're never benevolent.
Who is this guy? What's the five?
So many questions.
It's a good thing I have nothing to do today.
Except get answers out of you.
Fine.
You might actually be useful
in persuading my sister to cooperate.
The brotherhood of the five
was a group of highly skilled vampire hunters.
We crossed paths with them in the twelfth century.
Italy. My siblings and I had followed
the Normans as they conquered the south.
Feeding, turning people as we went.
These demons live among you.
Passing as human.
But with the bloodshed came exposure.
So witness with your own eyes...
He's putting on quite the show.
He's nothing.
I could eat him for sport.
Still, you should heed the warning.
Between you here and Kol in the east,
you have not been discreet.
Stories of the original vampires are spreading.
I welcome such infamy.
If you're worried about discretion,
perhaps you should wrangle our sister.
So these hunters
have been around for 900 years?
Apparently.
Well, our friend in the other room
is the first I've seen since then.
Kind of makes you wonder
what they've been up to all these years.
And Rebekah had a thing with one of them?
She didn't just have a thing.
She fell in love with him.
He told her all his secrets.
which I will gladly share with you...
Provided you do one thing for me.
And what's that?
Get Rebekah over here.
She's being stubborn.
And hateful. I need to make peace with her.
I want her to give me some very important information
about the hunter, which she won't do
unless she believes we've made up.
And...
What's in it for me?
Just get her here and I'll tell you.
And Stefan...
Trust me when I say this--
that hunter in there
holds the answer to all your prayers.
April.
Can I get you some more water?
I'm good.
I'm not just sitting here alone
like the loser new girl. I'm with my friend. She just...
Sorry. Family drama.
You two are friends?
Is it so hard to believe I would have one?
Yeah. It is.
And I'm keeping the truck.
Off limits! I have dibs.
You won't remember any of this.
Klaus wants me to fake peace with you
so you'll talk about the five.
Yeah, I bet. Don't help him.
He'll just betray you. It's what he does.
All right, forget him. Help me instead.
Why? You hate me more than he does.
Because I'm going to figure out what he's up to.
And plus I can give you the one thing that he won't.
And what's that?
A clean slate.
I'm not saying that I'm willing to forgive you
for what you did to Elena,
but I'm willing to set it aside and start over.
Why would you do that?
Because you're obviously
not leaving town any time soon,
and I'm just looking for a way we can all get along.
Plus, you can't be too happy wandering around school
with no friends.
What if I don't care what you or anyone else thinks?
I'm pretty sure that you care what,
Matt over there thinks.
So maybe I can talk to him
About a clean slate, too.
She's young and healthy, she'll heal up like a charm.
Just keep your eye on the ball.
It's not a game, Damon.
Fine, it's not a game,
It's a high-stakes dangerous maneuver.
Now, just go. Just like we practiced.
That's all you have to do.
Hey! You're in my anthro class, right?
Uh, yeah. I guess so.
I, uh, totally spaced
And forgot to get the reading list. Do you have it?
Sure. Let me check.
This isn't going to hurt. Please don't scream.
Who's that?
It's my little sister.
Get out of here. Go back to class.
What the hell are you doing?
I just...I saw the picture, and I--
Everybody is someone's uncle or father
Or camp counselor or Bible study teacher.
Elena, you don't know these people. Why do you care?
I care because I'm still me!
I still have the same feelings, Damon.
Sorry if that spoils your master plan
To turn me into a super vampire.
What's going on?
Nothing. Elena's educating me
On the importance of feelings.
Did you talk to the professor?
For a second. He found some stuff of my grams
In his office and he's going to dig it up for me.
Oh, uh, this.
Oh, nice.
The answer to all of our problems.
A frat party, douche central.
Which is why you'll be eating very well tonight.
So what should we go as?
Victims or killers?
You feeling all right, mate?
Are the shackles too tight?
Welcome home, sister.
This is a trick?
How do you know he's one of the five?
Where's his bloody tattoo?
Oh, the tattoos aren't visible
On this lot like they were on the last.
Let's eat.
Thank you, my lovely.
I could kiss the council
For burning up all the vervain in town.
They made my life so much easier.
Rebekah, love, eat your veggies.
I'm not eating till you apologize.
For which indiscretion? There have been so many.
You broke my neck.
You threw away Elena's blood
So I can't make any more hybrids.
'Cause you took me for granted! -
That's what big brothers do, sweetheart!
Let me just name the million other people
I'd rather be having dinner with right now.
All right, fine.
I'm sorry.
I often forget how delicate you are.
Forgive me?
I'll take it under consideration.
Ok, good. Ahem.
Now, why don't you tell me about Rebekah's hunter?
Right. Alexander.
Nice chap, forgoing the obvious issues.
He was looking for creatures of the night,
Which is why we felt quite safe around him
Wearing our daylight rings.
I'm unaccustomed to such luxury.
Well, it's the least we could do
to repay you for opening our eyes to the truth.
We're curious to hear more about your order.
Your crusade.
We are but five men.
Bound by fire and the last breath
of a dying witch to a single cause.
The destruction of all vampires.
And how do you hope to achieve this?
We have the ultimate weapon,
which no vampire can survive.
So, that's what this is about?
A weapon?
Not just any weapon.
Rebekah, love, don't get ahead of the story.
How is a weapon the answer to all of my prayers?
Ok.
Why don't we just skip with the theatrics
and get right to the point?
Not quite yet.
Because in order to find this weapon,
we need to solve the puzzle,
which seems to have disappeared.
What puzzle?
The tattoo.
What is it?
A map.
Leading us to its treasure.
Fat lot of good a tattoo's going to do if we can't see it.
We can't, but someone else can.
Why don't you tell the hybrid to bring him in, love?
You see, the hunter was so eager to get
to the bottom of his mystery tattoos
that he mentioned there was only one other person
who could see them.
I wouldn't. Lucky for us,
young Jeremy here is a bit of an artist.
I'm not helping you with anything.
I'm afraid you are.
I'm Frankie.
Unassuming serial killer.
I'm Jack.
And these are the two lovely ladies
I just...rippered.
Welcome to the murder house.
Bloody mary's free until midnight.
Enjoy yourselves.
Well, hats off to these idiots.
Oh, look, there's professor creepy.
His name is professor shane, and he's not creepy.
I'm going to go talk to him.
You do that.
Inebriated sleazeballs all covered in blood.
Come on, pick one.
I think I found one.
Roofie guy?
Nice choice. Go get 'em.
I'm sorry.
Drink?
Sure.
I'll be right back.
Great party, right?
You're not going to make a sound.
Now remember, the idea is not to kill him.
Elena.
Elena, step away from the ledge.
Elena!
Leave and forget about this.
Nice touch
How do you feel?
I feel good!
I want more.
You set me up at the hospital.
Led me to a trap.
Why?
You were trying to hurt people who are important to me.
Important to you?
That vampire just threatened to kill you.
I don't understand how you
could see the tattoo if you're a sympathizer.
What exactly do you understand?
'cause a couple days ago, you seemed to have all the answers.
And now you know jack.
Where did this tattoo come from?
Why am I the only one who can see it?
Years ago, I met someone with a mark.
Claimed he had this intense desire to kill vampires.
Like it was ingrained in his DNA.
Told me the same thing I told you--
If I could see the mark, I was a potential.
Who was he?
Just a guy I served in Iraq with.
I lost track of him, and then one day...
The tattoo just showed up on me.
It started on my hand, but the more vampires I killed,
the more it spread, like...
Like it was trying to tell me something.
I just--I just don't know what.
So tell me more about this tattoo.
My sister's suitor was unwilling to tell us anything.
Rebekah, however, was more than willing to...
investigate, isn't that right?
How do you read these symbols?
The map took my brothers and I years to translate.
The sword...
Is the key to reading it.
Have you considered my offer?
To come with me when I leave to follow the map?
I have.
And I would like that very much.
What is that?
Oh, that?
That...
is a very special weapon.
For a very special kind of vampire.
When my brotherhood has achieved its destiny,
those monsters will cease to exist.
Until then,
we have the daggers.
Do you really believe they're all so evil
they must be put down?
Let us not talk of such evil.
Let us do this.
Mmm. And this.
And this.
And this.
My sister's boyfriend
threw a slumber party that night.
He and his brothers put us all down in our sleep.
Elijah, Kol, Finn...and me.
How was I supposed to know?
Cheers. To my sister's uncanny ability to choose men.
I thought the daggers didn't work on you
because of your werewolf side.
They don't.
What happened?
Ask him.
Only, he cannot answer
because I have ripped out his tongue,
along with the rest of them.
Nik, I had no idea!
But you should have.
Your only family was nearly wiped out
because of your stupidity!
What did he promise you?
Nothing.
Nothing.
He would not have made a move
unless he knew you were vulnerable.
You trusted him...
over me!
What did he promise you?
Nothing, Nik, I swear!
What did he promise you?!
Tell me, Rebekah!
Go ahead, Rebekah, tell him.
Tell him what the hunter told you
the tattoo leads to.
What's this great weapon that could bring upon the end
of the vampire species?
A cure.
He said there was a cure.
There is no cure for vampirism.
I'm telling the truth, Stefan.
Then why wouldn't you have searched for it, found it?
Because when the hunters drew their final breath that night,
the marks disappeared from their body.
The map was gone, the brotherhood of the five extinct.
For 900 years, there was not a whisper of another hunter
until our friend in there showed up in town.
Well, now we have the map, what do we do next?
We don't do anything.
You can't be trusted, little sister.
You'll be blabbing this secret to the first boy who calls you pretty.
I mean, it's pathetic, really, isn't it?
How she continues to hand her heart
to any man who shows her a hint of affection.
You think she would have learned by now
from the endless cycle of disappointment and deception!
But I haven't! Instead I stay with you
and let you leech every moment
of happiness from my life.
You know, at least I faired better than Finn.
Klaus left him daggered because he was tired of his judgment.
No, Finn was a dullard.
He's more interesting lying in a box.
You want the cure for Elena, don't you?
So you can go back to mass producing your hybrids.
That's why you brought Stefan in,
cause you knew he'd help you even though he hates your guts.
You know what, you can shove your cure.
Well, I hope you got what you wanted out of her
before you chased her off.
She never would have told me what I needed to know.
But she'll tell you.
What do you need me to find out?
The map is useless without the tool to decipher it.
The sword.
She knows where it is. And you're going to get her to tell you.
You have a chance to save Elena
from the very thing that's going to destroy her.
You can call it a deal with the devil
if you like.
But you know you won't walk away from it.
I put your grandmother's stuff around here somewhere.
There were a couple family photos
and a first edition Stephen King.
Did you know she liked "Cujo"?
This is amazing. It's all stuff you picked up on your travels?
Yeah. I, uh, I do this thing.
It's like a one man traveling occult exhibit to small towns.
It funds my crazy Indiana Jones adventures.
Do you practice? Like she did?
I'm a true believer. Just don't tell anyone.
No, I don't practice. Not anymore.
I lost control of myself and there were consequences.
Witches love their consequences, don't they?
You know, there are other ways to practice magic. If you're interested.
Are you...
No. No, no, no.
I'm just, uh, i'm just a guy with a very open mind
who has seen a lot of things.
And I'm willing to test some of them out.
If you are.
Don't scream. This isn't going to hurt.
Oh, my god. Oh, my god.
Let's get out of here.
Nice lines.
Now, if you could just hurry it up a little bit.
I'm done.
What is this?
It's the tattoo.
I've seen the tattoo, you repugnant punk.
There's more to it.
That's all of it.
He said every time he kills a vampire, it spreads.
Nate!
Tell the girl to take Jeremy home.
Keep this one alive at all costs.
Looks like you got too much leash.
You're not going anywhere, so you might as well.
Stop the racket.
You're lucky I can't kill you.
Freak.
Who am I? Why am I acting like this?
Because you listened to Damon
and Damon makes everything he wants
sound like a good idea.
I should be here with Stefan.
I shouldn't be here with him.
I should be going through all this with Stefan.
I'm guessing we should hit the road.
You were supposed to help her,
and you let her get completely out of control.
She's not out of control, she was having fun.
This isn't fun. She's acting like a different person!
She is a different person! She's a vampire.
We're a predatory species. We enjoy the hunt,
the feed, and the kill. And when the guilt gets too bad,
we switch off our humanity and we revel in it.
Is that what you want? Her to be like you?
She already is like me.
And you know what makes me able to drink my fill
and leave someone breathing and not rip their head off
like my brother, is that I can revel in it.
I can make it fun.
I got your message.
I'm sorry. I know you wanted my help.
He just... makes me so angry.
No one deserves to be treated that way.
I wanted it back then.
The cure.
I was willing to leave behind my family for it.
Would you take it if you had the chance?
Or is it just for Elena?
Part of me wishes that she and I can have
an eternity together.
But Damon's right.
There's not a single vampire
who hasn't killed a human.
Elena will kill.
And then there will be the pain,
and the guilt, and then...
The humanity switch.
Elena, she's driven by love.
by compassion.
When she turns off her humanity,
then I don't think we'll ever get her back.
So I'd do anything to save her.
I envy that.
You and Elena.
I envy the love you have.
I really did believe Alex
when he said he loved me.
He promised we'd be married.
We even picked out a church.
San Vittore in Brienno.
I know you want my help, Stefan.
But I just can't do anything
that lets my brother get what he wants.
I never did answer your question.
If it meant that I got to be with her...
have children,
grow old with her...
If it meant that we'd die together,
be buried together...
Then, yes.
I'd take the cure.
I buried him.
Even after everything.
I laid him to rest in the place where we would be married.
What kind of hopeless fool does that?
But that's what you wanted to know, isn't it?
Because I buried him with his sword.
I'm sorry, little sister, but you're right.
You really are a hopeless fool.
I'm sorry, Rebekah.
Go right ahead.
Laugh at the girl who loved too easily.
But I would rather have lived my life than yours, Nik.
No one will ever sit around the table telling stories
about a man who couldn't love.
Do it.
Look me in the eye
and do it, you coward!
Do it!
I have a plane waiting.
I'll get the sword.
My hybrids will keep an eye on Connor.
You put Rebekah somewhere no one will find her.
And make sure Jeremy forgets everything he heard today.
I'll take care of it.
No one must know about the cure, do you understand?
Not Damon, not Elena.
Nobody.
If this gets out, it could mean all our deaths.
So if you tell anyone,
I'll erase each and every memory from all of you.
I won't say anything.
It's just you and me in this, Stefan.
Some secrets are stronger than family.
Well then.
Good night.
Damon...
I'm sorry.
Things got a little heated at the party,
And...
I shouldn't have let that happen.
It's just that I-- I feel like--
What do you feel, Elena?
When you tell me what a vampire should be,
deep down, I believe you.
I think that you're right, and I--I hate that feeling.
Because I don't want to be...
You don't want to be like me.
Hey.
Hey.
What are you doing here?
Just hanging out with Jeremy.
We had a couple things to talk about.
Any news on the hunter?
No. No, nothing new.
Well, then today was a bust.
She's all yours.
So, uh...
What happened?
I learned how to feed
without hurting someone.
It was awful.
You were right, I... got caught up in it.
Ah, it'll get easier.
But I don't want it to get easier.
I can't live like this.
Stefan, I'm...
feeling things that I don't--
I don't want to feel, and I'm becoming someone
that I don't want to be.
I don't think I'm going to survive this.
Hey. Yes, you will. I promise.
No.
You just have to hold on.
Yeah, I got it. I'll keep him fat and happy.
You should send two more for protection.
Make that three.
Shouldn't you be in Mystic Falls killing vampires?
