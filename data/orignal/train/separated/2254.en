第四集
It's, um...
It's very beautiful.
So what's the occasion?
The occasion is us.
We haven't really gotten out much
since Storybrooke awakened,
so I thought we should see it together.
Thank you.
Don't get your hopes up.
The nightlife is extremely limited.
No. That's not what I meant.
Thank you for... for what you're doing.
For how you're changing.
Okay, 'stiltskin, I want my ax.
I'm sorry, but we're closed.
It's mine. Give it to me.
And yet, still closed.
Just 'cause you possess something don't mean it's yours.
Nothing in this shop belongs to you.
And you?
How can you be with such a monster?
Or maybe you're just another possession, too.
How...
dare you?!
You want your ax?
Fine!
Rumplestiltskin!
You can have it...
buried in your chest!
Stop!
Stop! This isn't you anymore!
Oh, it's me, dearie.
Always has been, always will be.
Milah?
Bae?
I'm home.
Bae.
Papa?
Where's mom?
Well, she probably just... lost track of time.
Grab your cloak.
We'll find her.
Ahoy, my three mates!
Milah.
Milah.
It's time to go.
Good. So go.
Who's this?
Ah, it's no one.
It's just my husband.
Oh. Well, he's a tad taller than you described.
Please. You have responsibilities.
You mean like being a man and fighting in the ogre wars?
Other wives became honored widows
while I became lashed to the village coward.
I need a break.
Run home, Rumple.
It's what you're good at.
Mama?
Bae.
You were supposed to wait outside, son.
You don't really
wish I'd died...
during the ogre wars, do you?
I wish you'd fought.
Don't you?
Well, I- I'm alive,
and I'm here with you,
with Bae.
This isn't a life,
not for me.
Why can't we just leave?
W-we've talked about that.
You don't have to be the village coward.
We could start again,
go somewhere no one knows us,
see... the whole world beyond this village.
I know this wasn't the life you wanted,
but it-- it can be good...
here.
At least try,
if not for me, then...
for Bae.
Okay.
I'll try.
What are you doing?
I was, uh, gonna make you breakfast.
No. In-- in the basement.
I saw you practicing magic.
Want some breakfast?
No, we need to talk about this.
It was just a couple of spells. Nothing to be concerned about.
Okay, then be honest with me.
Why did you bring magic here?
I've told you. Magic is power.
Why do you need it?
Tell me.
You don't need power, Rumple. You need courage...
to let me in.
Rumplestiltskin, you need to get to the docks now.
The docks? Why?
The men who came into port last week-- they've taken Milah.
They're setting sail. You must hurry.
On your feet for the captain.
I- I remember you, f-from the bar.
It's always nice to make an impression.
Where are my manners?
We haven't been formally introduced.
Killian Jones.
Now what are you doing aboard my ship?
You have my wife.
I've had many a man's wife.
No, you-- you see, we-- we have a son,
and he needs his mother.
And see, I have a ship full of men who need... companionship.
I-I'm begging you.
Please let her go.
I'm not much for bartering.
That said,
I do consider myself an honorable man,
a man with a code. So...
If you truly want your wife back...
all you have to do is take her.
Never been in a duel before, I take it?
Well, it's quite simple, really.
The pointy end goes in the other guy.
Go on.
Pick it up.
A man unwilling to fight for what he wants,
deserves what he gets.
Please, sir.
What am I gonna tell my boy?
Try the truth.
His father's a coward.
Keep swinging, dwarves.
Did they find any fairy dust yet?
No, not yet.
But they will, and when they do, we'll figure out a way
to get Mary Margaret and my mom back.
I'll be back later with lunch.
I hate mine dust.
Leroy?
If you find anything, I'll be at the sheriff's station.
You taking over as sheriff?
Stepping in...
Until Emma gets back.
Belle?
Come on. At least come and eat something.
Belle?
I was wondering if you'd heard from your daughter.
Is this some kind of cruel joke?
Would I have made this flyer if I knew where she was?
The only reason she's missing
is because of the deal I made with you,
but I'd held out hope she might have survived
such a wicked trade.
And she has.
Why hasn't she come looking for me?
Well, she did.
She even made the flyer like this one.
And let me guess.
You took care of it by throwing it in the trash.
I don't expect you to help me.
I just wanna know she's safe.
And now, thanks to you,
neither one of us knows where she is.
You're a monster, Rumplestiltskin.
It really is you.
The dark one, in the flesh.
Or... Whatever that is.
You've gone to a lot of trouble to meet me.
You better hope I agree it's worth my time.
I've heard you've been looking for something,
and as luck would have it.
I'm a man who trades in hard-to-find objects.
Like a bean,
a magic bean.
That can transport you between worlds.
I've been told,
they no longer exist in this land.
Not in this land, no.
But the ships that dock here often return
from far off lands with treasures
they don't always understand.
And yet you do.
It's my job,
as is knowing the rumors of who might pay the highest price
for said treasures.
And what rumors could they be?
That... You were once a great coward
But that you became the dark one to overcome that.
And protect a-a son who you lost despite all--
It's not nice to spread rumors.
A bean!
Where... Is it?
I don't have it.
But I hid it. I-I swear.
You haven't heard my price.
I spin straw into gold.
Price shouldn't be a problem.
Oh, I don't want money. I want eternal life.
Only the dark one has life eternal.
Tell you what, my son.
What I can do-- what about youth?
Spin the clock back...
Till you're a little boy again.
Close enough. Deal.
But remember...
You fail to deliver, I spin the clock forward
and turn you into dust.
Thank you. Thank you.
You sure you don't want anything?
Where's my scurvy crew?
Ah! Here we be, cap'n!
Where's my beer?
You know, I suddenly find myself quite thirsty.
Cheers.
Thank you.
Are you okay?
That's your third iced tea this morning.
Wouldn't wanna have to call you a cab.
No, I-I've never had it iced before.
It's--it's delicious.
I haven't seen you in here before.
Well, I, uh...
I've been a kept woman until recently.
Let me guess. Bad breakup?
I... think I may be headed there.
And do you have a place to stay? Any family here?
Uh, I'm--I'm not sure. I'm still looking.
But I'm on my own for now.
I could ask granny about a room here.
Really?
Thanks.
Ruby.
Belle.
What I really need, though, is--is a life, a job.
Well, uh, what do you like to do?
I do love books.
The library. It's been closed forever,
but, uh, things are changing now.
Maybe they need a librarian.
Excuse me, Miss.
You startled me.
I-I was just wondering if you had any spare change.
Oh, no, sorry. I-I don't have any money.
What--what about a friend? Are you meeting anyone here?
Uh, no. Why?
I just wanted to make sure.
Hey, you! Stop.
Even gutter rats have more manners than you just displayed.
No, I'm so sorry, sir.
I was wrong.
Not a rat at all. More...
More like a crocodile.
What's your name... Crocodile?
You. I remember you.
Always nice to make an impression.
Where are my manners?
We haven't been properly introduced.
Rumplestiltskin,
or as others know me,
The dark one.
I see my reputation precedes me.
It does?
Good!
That's gonna save us time
during the question and answer portion of our game.
What is it you want to know?
How's Milah, of course?
Who?
Only too happy to, uh, dig out the memory,
but... it gets really messy.
She's dead.
Died a long time ago.
What is it you want?
We didn't get a chance to finish our duel.
Ha! Not now.
Tomorrow at dawn. I am not a cruel man.
Get your affairs in order.
Also, you can spend tonight knowing
it'll be your last.
Maybe I am cruel.
And don't think about trying to escape,
because I will find you,
and I will gut your entire crew...
like the fish.
May I have a word?
Sheriff.
Uh, acting sheriff. And I'm already late
on another busy day, cleaning up the mess you made.
My apologies. That was a moment of poor judgment on my part.
And it's not lost on me
that I'm now here to ask for your help.
Well, then it shouldn't be lost on you when I say "No."
Hear me out first.
I'm here to report a missing person.
She left my home early this morning.
Her name is Belle.
Back in our land, you mentioned you loved someone once.
Is--
Yes.
You also said she died.
I thought she had.
Well, why don't you just use the tracking spell
you gave me to find Jefferson?
It only works if you have something the person owned.
I-I don't.
How can you be sure she's gone missing
and not... run away?
I can't.
Look, the townsfolk
are less than sympathetic to my plight, but you--
You're in the rather unique position
to understand exactly what I'm going through.
Won't you help me?
Pick it up, dearie,
and let's begin.
There's no need.
Sorry,
but killing a man with his own sword
was just too delicious to pass up.
Ships that pass in the night.
Well, at least one ship.
Go on. I'm ready for the sword.
No.
Do you know what it's like
to have your wife stolen from you?
To feel powerless to stop it?
It feels like having your heart ripped from your chest.
Actually, let me show you.
Stop!
Milah.
Who are you? What-- what do you want from me?
I'm just a man who procures hard-to-find objects.
In this case, the object was you.
So then who-- who put you up to this?
Belle?
Oh. Oh, how I've missed you, Belle.
I'm so sorry this is how we had to be reunited.
Please understand.
I had no choice.
But kidnap me?
After the curse broke,
I searched all over for you and discovered
the dark one still had you captive.
He wasn't holding me captive.
I chose to be with him.
Are you saying you fell in love with him?
But I fear it may be over now.
It must be.
Promise me you no longer love him,
that you will never see him again.
I'm not-- I'm not a child.
You don't understand what that man will do to you,
what he's already done.
No, you don't understand.
It's my life.
Then I don't have a choice.
I'm sorry.
Do it.
What? Father?
Father, what-- what are you doing? Stop!
Good-bye, Belle. I love you.
Father!
Yeah, that's him, all right.
Do you remember turning a butcher into a pig?
Can't say that I do. Why?
Well, he does.
And apparently, it was his father.
I'm beginning to understand why nobody wants to help you.
Well, what-- h-has he seen Belle?
Afraid not.
Okay, so what's next?
Granny's.
We can see who else you terrorized there.
Look, uh...
Can I ask you a question?
About you and Mary Margaret?
H-how are...
How does that work?
Are you asking dating advice?
Of course not, no.
Honesty.
That's how we did it.
Hard work and being honest with one another.
Well... I don't lie.
There's a difference between literal truth
and honesty of the heart.
Nothing taught me that more than this curse.
Milah. Uhh!
How?
Milah, you have to run.
No. I'm not leaving without you.
Oh, how sweet.
It appears there's more to this tale than I know.
Tell it to me, Milah.
Please don't hurt him. I can explain.
Tick-tock, dearie. Tick-tock.
That first night when Killian and his crew
came into the tavern,
he told stories about the places he'd been,
and I fell in love with him.
I didn't mean for it to turn out this way.
I didn't know how to tell you the truth.
I'm sorry.
And so here we are.
You've come to save the life of your true love,
the pirate.
I didn't realize the power of true love before.
It is impressive.
I'd hate to break it up.
Actually, no.
I'd love to.
Aah! Wait.
I have something you want.
Well, I find that very difficult to believe.
Where did you get that?
You know who I took it from.
I may not know what the dark one wants,
with a magic bean,
but I have it.
Oh, I feel a proposal coming on.
The magic bean in exchange for our lives.
Deal?
I wanna see it first.
Belle, huh?
Sorry. Doesn't... Ring a bell.
Ruby, listen to me.
If you've come across her, you gotta tell me.
I'll make sure nothing bad happens.
Yeah, but what about him?
I've got him. Trust me.
She was in earlier.
She was looking for a job.
I pointed her in the direction of the library.
When do you think she went there?
Don't know.
But...
When you find her, give her this.
She left it in her booth.
No, that's mine.
She didn't have anything for the cold.
You sure you'll watch out for her?
Yes.
Why?
I think...
I think I can find her.
Lately, since things changed,
I've been, uh, a little more sensitive to odors.
What, you can smell her?
I guess it's 'cause of the wolf thing.
What's wrong?
I had her, but... I lost her trail.
It must be the flowers.
I can't track her anymore. I'm sorry.
Don't be. This is her father's shop.
You again.
Out. This is a private establishment.
you're not welcome.
Where's Belle?
I won't let anything happen to her, Moe.
We're just worried.
Don't be. She's safe.
So you can stop looking.
Look, if I could just have the chance to talk to her.
You will destroy Belle like you destroy everything else.
Well, I won't let that happen.
What have you done with her?
There's only one way to get her away from you.
What have you done?
I have to make her forget about you,
no matter the cost.
Even if it means she forgets me, too.
He's sending her across the town line.
Where are you sending Belle across?
You know we have patrols on the storybrooke line
to make sure no one crosses accidentally.
So how are you planning to pull it off?
Where?! Where are you sending her across?
Tell me where!
Stop it. You're gonna kill him.
You've been down in the mines.
The tunnels. They lead out of town.
Move it out!
Milah, what happened?
Fetch some water.
Get the captain water!
And get me that prisoner from below deck
along with the booty he carried. Now!
Bring up the prisoner!
Well, well, seems like you finally found the family
you could never have with me.
All right, get your sorry arse up there.
You asked to see it, and now you have.
Do we have a deal?
Can we go our separate ways?
Do you mean,
do I forgive you?
Can I move on?
Perhaps. Perhaps.
I can see you are... truly in love.
Thank you.
Just one question.
What do you want to know?
How could you leave Bae?
Do you know what it was like walking home that night...
Rumple--
knowing I had to tell our son...
Please.
His mother was dead?
I was wrong to lie to you. I was the coward. I knew that.
You left him! You abandoned him!
And there's not a day that goes by
that I don't feel sorry for that--
Sorry isn't enough!
You let him go.
I let my misery cloud my judgment.
Why were you so miserable?
Because I never loved you.
Enough!
No!
I love you.
You may be more powerful now, demon,
but you're no less a coward.
I'll have what I came for now.
You'll have to kill me first.
I'm afraid that's not in the cards for you, sonny boy.
I want you alive.
Because I want you to suffer like I did.
Killing me is gonna take a lot more than that, dearie.
Even demons can be killed.
I will find a way.
Well, good luck living long enough.
please.
Please, please stop. What are you doing?
Sending you on a little ride under the town line.
Once you cross,
you'll forget who you were in the other realm and who you loved.
This should help you find the key.
I left it at the bottom of the cart.
Good luck.
William!
I'm begging you! Please don't--don't do this!
Please!
Stop!
What's happening?!
That is seriously... Wow.
Belle, are you all right?
I, uh, I think so.
Do you remember who I am?
I do. Rumplestiltskin. I...
I remember.
What's wrong?
Thank you for what you just did,
but that doesn't change that you're too cowardly
to be honest with me.
But, Belle, I--
I tried to tell him that, Belle. Come with me, darling.
After what you just tried to do to me?
You're no better, father.
You don't get to decide what I do or how I feel. I do.
If either of you cared about me, you would've listened.
I don't wanna see either of you again.
Ever.
This one is a classic.
The syrup goes on the pancakes--
the, um, round things.
But I kind of like when it gets on everything.
You know, uh, thank you.
And not just for this, but...
for everything.
No worries. And stay here until you're on your feet.
Granny will be fine with it.
Oh, I almost forgot.
Someone dropped this off for you at the front desk.
"We may sit in our library,
and yet be in all quarters of the earth."
You gave me the key?
I heard of your interest, and I, uh...
I made some inquiries.
There's an apartment for the caretaker.
If you want it.
If--if this is some way to win me back,
after everything you--
That's--that's-- that's not why I'm here.
I came because...
You're right...
About me.
I am a coward.
I have been my entire life.
I tried to make up for it by collecting power,
and the power became so important
that I couldn't let go...
Not even...
when that meant losing the most important person in my life.
Your son.
Baelfire is his name.
After he left,
I dedicated myself to finding him.
I went down many, many paths
until I found a curse
that could take me to the land where he'd escaped.
Here.
And I found myself in this little town
with only one thing left to do.
Wait for the curse to be broken
so that I could leave
and find him.
But instead of looking for him, you brought magic.
Because I'm still a coward.
Magic has become a crutch
that I can't walk without.
And even if I could,
I know now I can never leave this place.
Because anyone who leaves forgets the people they love.
So when you go to look for Baelfire...
You won't know him.
Magic comes with a price.
Belle, I have to break this new curse.
That's why I was using magic
that night you saw me down in the basement.
I have lost so much that I loved.
I didn't wanna lose you again
without you knowing...
everything.
Good-bye, Belle.
Do you, um,
Have you ever had a hamburger?
Yes, of course.
Well, I haven't.
But I hear that Granny's makes a great one.
Maybe--maybe we could...
try it sometime?
I would like that.
No.
He tricked me!
Allow him to speak.
I want my bean.
Let me tell you how it works on my ship.
I make the demands. You follow them.
The bean's now mine.
You have to give me something for it.
Oh, I will. Your life.
The chance to join my crew.
So instead of the promise of eternal life,
I get to scrub blood off your decks. How is that right?
What if I was to tell you I was about to set sail
to a land where none of us will ever grow old?
Where I can discover how to get my revenge on Rumplestiltskin?
I'd say I could live with that.
Good. What's your name, sailor?
William.
William Smee.
Can I have my hat?
Well, Mr. Smee,
welcome aboard.
Harden up and get ready to set sail, mates!
There's bumpy seas ahead.
What's the name of the place we're headed, cap'n?
Neverland.
You're probably wondering
why I brought you here.
I found this
in the mines...
Mr. Smee.
I am so sorry. I didn't have--
I'm not interested in apologies.
I'm interested in information
about the man you work for.
I'll tell you anything you wanna know about Moe.
No. Not about moe.
Your captain.
Where is he?
I've never seen him in Storybrooke, I swear.
For some reason, when the curse hit,
It--it didn't take him.
Then where... is... he?
Hello, Hook.
Hello, Cora.
You tell me it's something important
you needed to show me.
Sparkly dirt. Wonderful.
Just the remains of a magical wardrobe
that can travel between worlds.
Is it enough to get us where we need to go?
Not quite, but it's a start.
We're almost ready to set sail.
What's our port of destination?
Storybrooke.
Curious name. Is that where--
She is.
And so is he.
Excellent.
You'll be able to see your daughter.
