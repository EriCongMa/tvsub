Attention, passengers.
The 6:45 train is now departing.
Take the far end of the platform.
Yeah.
Attention, passengers.
The 6:45 train is now departing.
I'm just saying that "Kent Drake"
is not the name of a real person.
I've seen his file and his picture.
We had a videoconference interview.
Tall, dark, handsome,
Suit slightly too large for his body?
Because his superhero suit is on underneath it.
He is not a superhero.
He is a military-school graduate.
Superhero.
Glasgow Medical School.
Just finished a tour in Afghanistan.
Marvel superhero.
Well, is that a good thing or a bad thing?
If you have to ask...
Anyway, he wants to move from trauma medicine
to forensic pathology,
And Kent is the strongest applicant I've had
for an assistant medical examiner
since I came to Boston, so...
Six-month rotation?
You'll spend the entire time trying to figure out
what his superhero power is...
or isn't.
Uncle Enzo was getting rid of it.
I can understand why. That is horrible.
Oh, I have seen worse, and, even if it is, it was free.
Well, the true value of something
isn't always determined by its price, Angela.
Which is a super polite way of saying that is horrible.
Well, you two don't have to look at it.
I got it for Frankie.
Well, he doesn't have any taste. He'll probably love it.
Rizzoli.
Isles.
Hey, I need some help getting this to Frankie's place.
It'll have to wait till later. Sorry.
I bet it's super uncomfortable, too.
It's still free!
第六季 第一集
Right now, she's a Jane Doe.
Homeless guy found her this morning.
Didn't see her get dumped.
You want to keep her wrapped up, right?
Yes, I don't want to lose anything
that might be trapped in the rug with her.
Hey, good luck, Frankie.
Thanks, Garcia.
How does everybody know I'm trying to get the bric commander job?
Because you've had lunch with every boss at BPD.
Well, not every boss.
Yeah, only because nobody wants to watch McCorskey eat.
Well, I would say he has a temporomandibular disorder.
Makes chewing difficult.
Well, he doesn't know you said it.
If you feel so bad, why don't you take him out to lunch?
I don't feel that bad.
The dumpster was emptied two days ago,
so the body could only have been there since then.
Are there any offices or apartments
that are near this alley?
No, it's all warehouses and manufacturing.
Well, that probably means
she came from somewhere else, then.
And judging by the size of this rug,
Might have taken two people to get her here.
Two people who didn't think anybody would notice them
dumping a body in downtown Boston.
So we can eliminate folks who stand out.
Clowns.
Siamese twins?
McCorskey.
I'll make sure the uniforms are asking
about two people looking suspicious.
Centaurs.
Pirates.
Organ-grinders.
Well, everyone would notice the monkeys.
Excuse me.
Excuse me!
Dr. Isles.
Yes.
No.
Hi. I'm Kent Drake.
Nice to meet you.
And you must be Detective Rizzoli.
Yes. Hi.
Senior criminalist Chang, she, uh --
Well, um, she holds you in very high regard.
Anyway, Susie told me to go ahead and get started.
Now, I was concerned about losing any trace evidence,
so I -- I've wrapped the body so I could vacuum around here.
Watch the rug, please.
Um, now, given the fact that she's a Jane Doe,
I removed her effects and laid them out.
Hopefully, we can help with identification.
In plastic wrapping, per jaybee.
Yeah, well, I didn't know
your policies and procedures around here,
So I just went, well, textbook.
You've been very busy.
Yeah, well, in a conflict zone,
you get used to moving at a fast pace.
I'm sorry. Do you like my shoes?
They're very comfortable.
You should try them sometime.
No.
Nope!
The internet village.
I'm just gonna go there.
Nice to meet you.
Is she always like that?
Yes.
In the very best way possible.
Well, let's get started.
We only have six months to complete your training.
That's Mona.
Mona Carson.
When was the last time you saw her?
When she gave her notice three weeks ago.
She was so nice.
I just can't believe that she --
She say why she was giving her notice?
No.
She'd been pulling away from all of us for a while.
You must have some idea.
Spike.
Is that her boyfriend?
Yeah.
When they started to get serious, she changed,
got...nervous, withdrawn.
Spike is probably not the name his parents gave him.
That's the only thing she ever called him.
But I have a picture.
He was at Mona's birthday party.
He still look like that?
Last time I saw him.
I never liked him, but with your friends,
it's hard to say something, you know?
Watch your fingers.
Watch your fingers. Okay.
That way.
All right.
Oh, god.
I don't remember Frankie's apartment being this nice.
Yeah, it's a different apartment. He moved.
What?
Yeah, this one is two floors higher.
I guess I didn't notice
what button you pushed in the elevator.
I was so worried about trying to avoid a hernia
of the entire body.
That's not what a hernia is.
Yes, I know that.
How come I didn't know
that Frankie was getting a new place?
Uh...he was keeping it a secret?
Until when?
I...
Oh! What the hell?!
Until now, I'm guessing.
I've seen your chest.
Yeah, but that was always near a pool.
Ma, what are you doing here?
What are you doing,
not telling me that you got a new place?
I was gonna tell youse, as it's all fixed up.
There -- it's all fixed up.
I don't want that.
It's a nice chair.
It's awful,
and I'm trying to go a different way.
Yeah, the secret way.
Come on, Janie.
Like you don't have any secrets.
Yes, I have secrets. I'm allowed to have secrets.
You are not allowed.
I just wanted it to be totally nice when you saw it.
So you'd know I'm not your door-and-cinder-block,
desk-using younger brother anymore.
All right, that's sweet.
What about the chair?
Totally cramping my style.
Will you take it downstairs?
I'm getting ready for a date.
Sure.
Fine, fine.
I'll do it.
I think you look great.
You should wear pants.
Have fun tonight.
Ma, this chair is --
Free!
Free covers a lot of ugly.
So, it turns out our vic not only quit her job,
she closed her social-media accounts,
cancelled her cellphone, stopped using her credit cards.
To top it all off, when they searched her apartment,
they found a packed suitcase.
She was about to go on the run.
Or enter a convent.
Both good options for a woman with a bad boyfriend.
Well, I think there are a few other things
she might have considered.
I didn't find any calls to shelters
or restraining orders filed with police.
Is there any evidence that Spike was actually abusive?
One neighbor said she never heard them fighting,
but a couple of weeks ago,
she complimented Spike on his hair --
he almost ripped her head off.
So he's wound a little tight.
Clearly.
Tight enough to snap
if he thought Mona was gonna leave him?
Only way to know for sure is to find him.
Is her apartment missing a rug?
Hardwood floors. No way to know.
If it was easy, anybody could do it.
Holiday.
Rizzoli.
Sounds like something your mom would serve for dinner.
"Kids, come to the table.
The Holiday Rizzoli is ready."
You don't know many Italians, do you?
Just you guys.
Because my ma would've said that about 80 decibels louder
and the phrases "Before I" and "Don't make me"
are conspicuously missing.
I went through Mona's cellphone records.
Before she stopped using it,
there were a lot of calls to a Cecil Wilson.
Is that the boyfriend, Spike?
If my name were Cecil,
almost anything would be preferable.
We have an address?
Yep. I'll text it to you.
And Jane.
Tell her I'll meet them there.
And while our satellite offices
don't have the lab equipment that we do,
We will process, on a priority basis,
any evidence you deem necessary.
How long have you actually worked here?
About five years.
And did you ever practice any other type of medicine
before you became an M.E.?
Only in my residency.
So, our refrigerated storage is down the hall.
Would you like to see it?
Do you actually enjoy this managerial side of your job?
You ask a lot of questions.
I'm sorry. I'm just curious.
I am not prying maliciously.
Please, feel free to ask me anything you like.
Well, I have worn those shoes, working out,
but I've never really thought of them as business attire.
Right, well, technically, that's not a question, is it?
No, I just don't find them suitable.
Unlike your 4-inch heels?
Three, and I often have business meetings.
You don't have to justify your choice to me.
I have no judgment.
If he's in there, he hasn't come out.
If he's not there, he hasn't come home.
All right. We're gonna go check out the apartment.
You sit tight. Call us if you see him.
BPD. We'd like to talk to you.
Frankie, he's on the run,
Probably going down the fire escape.
Head down to the lobby
in case he goes through a window on another floor.
Frankie, he's headed north down the back alley.
Take the far end of the platform.
Boston police!
Drop your weapon!
Back up. I need everyone to take a step back.
I need an ambulance
at the Essex street subway platform for a gunshot victim.
This is an officer-involved shooting.
Did he have a gun?
Yeah.
Did you pick it up?
No.
Where is it?
I don't know. We'll find it.
Where is it, Korsak?!
Jane, he -- he -- he had a gun.
I-I-I swear he had a gun.
Okay. We'll find it.
He had a gun, Jane.
Okay.
We just need to know what happened
so we can figure out where it went.
I was chasing that Spike guy.
He ran through a group of people,
And then, all of a sudden,
that... other guy was pointing a gun at me.
You said he ran near Spike?
Yeah, yeah, he definitely did.
Is it possible the gun was in Spike's hand
and you just thought that it was --
The guy I shot had a gun!
Al-all right, Frankie. He's got to ask, okay?
Okay.
All right.
Oh, my god.
If we can't find that gun, I'm screwed.
Listen to me, okay?
Korsak and I are going to talk to the witnesses.
All right? We'll look at the security video.
How long before IAD gets here, huh, 10 minutes?
They're not gonna let you do anything.
Frankie.
Do you remember Bennie Johnson?
He was a dirty cop. This is a totally different thing.
We will find the gun, okay?
I promise.
Jane.
How is he?
Not much bleeding externally,
So it's possible that he's hemorrhaging internally.
The trauma unit is waiting for him at general.
Okay. What is that?
Frankie seems anxious, which is understandable.
This was a very traumatic event.
So the EMTs gave me a mild sedative to administer to him.
And he can't talk to IAD until it wears off.
I'm just treating the symptoms.
We're gonna send you to the hospital, okay?
I'm fine.
No, you're gonna go to the hospital,
and Maura has a sedative to help you calm down.
Don't talk to anybody until you can think clearly.
Okay. Okay.
I heard back from the union.
They're sending a lawyer to the hospital.
Okay, thanks.
Social services to pediatrics.
The victim's name is Sean Hughes.
23 years old, lives in south Boston.
What are the odds that Spike and Sean don't know each other?
Seems unlikely.
So, if Mona and that carpet
were put in a dumpster by two people --
Maybe Sean's one of them, maybe Spike's the other --
And they were meeting at the platform.
Sean pulls a gun
'cause he doesn't want to get caught for Mona's murder.
It makes sense.
Still doesn't explain what happened to the gun.
Well, maybe it got kicked into the tracks
and a train pushed it down the tunnel.
Maybe somebody picked it up.
Hitchcock from IAD.
Oh, that's a short straw.
We need the security video from that platform.
IAD's gonna piss all over us
if we start investigating this shooting.
Well, then we better do as much as we can
before they find out.
Sean Hughes is a student at SBCC.
Takes a lot of poli-sci classes.
I found some donations to left-leaning politicians
and pictures of him at demonstrations,
but everything's of the chant-in-unison sort.
Nothing indicates he's violent.
He ever been in our system?
No, he's clean.
Except that, if Sean had a gun --
He had a gun.
Then Sean didn't have a license for it.
It's possible he registered under another name.
I'll keep digging.
Who's processing the warrant for his credit-card records?
No one.
I don't want IAD knowing that we're looking at him
and shutting us down before we even get started.
Um, what about the security video at the subway platform?
Techs are at the subway working on it.
Should be in our building any minute.
Can you sweet-talk a copy for us?
It's the fastest way we're gonna clear Frankie.
Rizzoli.
Yeah.
I'm grabbing a sandwich.
How's a half-hour?
Great. Thanks.
IAD?
Clock's ticking.
The victim's stomach contents.
Maltodextrin, oat powder,
whey isolate.
Protein shake.
The ingredients are consistent
with a commercial product called Parallax.
Computer geeks drink it so they don't have to leave their chairs.
Well, she had excellent muscle tone,
So she definitely left her chair.
Is there something else we can do?
Mona died before the shooting,
So I'm not sure what else she has to tell us.
It's a simple question, detective.
How did Frankie seem this morning?
Fine.
He was the same asshole
that I've been dealt with for the past 35 years.
Look, we get it.
You're chasing a potential killer.
It's a crowded subway platform.
Frankie gets worried a bystander may get hurt,
So he fires off a warning shot.
Is that what Frankie said?
We're just trying to figure out how an unarmed civilian
gets shot by a BPD detective.
You don't have to figure it out.
All you have to do is -- is watch the security video.
The facts should speak for themselves.
Wha-- have you seen it?
We're not at liberty to say.
Did you see the gun, Jane?
No.
Simmons, come on, all right?
You're a good guy. Just --
Just keep an open mind, okay?
Of course.
Seems like you need to keep an open mind yourself, detective.
Vince.
Hey, Sam.
It's been a long time.
You were at the bar last night.
You know, you should come back to the bowling league.
You're right. I should.
Send me an e-mail and let me know the next night.
Yeah, will do.
IAD knows something.
Yep.
The video system at the subway malfunctioned.
It won't clear Frankie because it's blank.
How do you know that?
Sam Lewis slipped me this downstairs.
He knew they wouldn't tell us.
There'll be a lot of ass-covering.
没有录像
We didn't see anything.
We haven't found a witness who saw anything.
Without that video...
It's just Frankie's word there was a gun.
There's no proof.
They're gonna hang him out to dry.
Here's the latest on the police shooting
at the Essex Street subway station.
The spokesperson for Boston General confirmed
that the victim is in surgery...
Here, baby.
...and, at this point...
Okay,
had no comment,on his condition.
that's enough of this.
They're saying the D.A.
is gonna take the shooting to a Grand Jury,
if the facts continue to support it.
Maybe even tomorrow.
The facts won't support it.
Ma...
I could go to jail.
Nope.
We didn't find a gun.
Which doesn't mean there wasn't one.
Then where did it go?
I don't know.
But I know you and I know Jane
and you don't just shoot people for no reason.
And Jane won't stop
until she gets to the bottom of things.
Right?
Frankie, everything's gonna be okay.
I know it.
Have you made any progress yet?
What if he did it, Maura?
I mean, what if he shot an unarmed man?
I'm afraid it's a little worse now.
Sean Hughes died.
His body is on its way here for an autopsy.
Well, you can't do an autopsy
because you're Frankie's friend.
Right.
And I can't watch the autopsy because I'm Frankie's sister.
That is, in theory, true.
How long have these cameras been in the autopsy room?
My predecessor thought he might get rich
if he made a series of instructional videos.
Get out of the way!
Oh! Come on.
Did you see the stomach contents?
Uh -- no.
Okay, give -- give me your coffee.
Wait, that --
Steve?
Hmm?
I went to get a coffee and they made it wrong,
so I have an extra cappuccino.
Thought you'd be tired and you might want it.
No, thanks.
Okay.
Well, I will just --
I'll leave it right here in case you change your mind.
Okay.
Come on. Get the coffee.
Well, what are you gonna do
when he finds out it's used coffee?
Yes!
Yes! Okay.
There you go.
He had some weird food.
Mona had a protein drink in her stomach.
I mean, there's no way for me to know
if what's in that basin is the same as what she drank, but...
Well, two liquid lunches do seem coincidental.
I'm not going to say that.
Yeah, but if they're drinking the same kind of drink
and Sean Hughes and Mona Carson are connected
and he's murder-adjacent,
and I can keep looking into his shooting
as part of my case.
I will totally forgive you for taking my coffee.
You're welcome.
Korsak, hey, what judge owes you a favor?
I-I'm really sorry, detectives.
I'm not supposed to let anyone in.
Right, except for anyone involved in the investigation.
Good for you, standing your ground.
I'm sure that Sergeant...
Washington.
Washington would like to hear about this.
Not every newbie can do that.
Aren't you impressed, Korsak?
Bursting.
Thanks.
Good job.
What the hell are those?
I have no idea.
Jane, I--
Hey, I just sent you a picture. What are we looking at?
Look at the back or the bottom. See if there are any labels.
Yeah, FCO, DME, SFX.
Those are routers.
The codes on the bottom correspond to airport codes of
the cities they're routing through.
Jane--
Routers?
And they had programmer food in their stomachs.
These three knew each other. They were up to something.
Jane--
That's why Sean had a gun. That's why Mona is dead.
Korsak.
Yes.
Can you guys come back to BPD?
Yeah, we'll be right there.
Hey. Let's see it.
I grabbed the footage from social-media sites,
so it's jumpy and there are missing moments,
But it's the best I can do with what we've got.
Stop.
Back it up.
There.
Play it forward, slowly.
There was a gun.
Somebody took it.
We know it wasn't spike because we saw him run off.
Are you gonna tell IAD?
No.
They won't let Frankie off the hook
unless we can deliver them another suspect.
So we should do that.
Yes, we should.
That's Rizzoli-ese for "thank you."
Hey, Korsak.
Come here for a second.
Watch this guy right here.
He doesn't panic when Frankie's gun goes off.
No, and then he just calmly walks into the crowd.
Like he sees Sean's gun on the ground
and heads over to pick it up?
Yeah.
Why?
Maybe he needed a gun.
Or maybe he didn't want Sean to be found with a gun.
Again, why?
Well, we have spike, who runs right near a guy with a gun,
Then we have this guy, who is completely unfazed by the entire thing.
Some sort of criminal conspiracy.
I'm okay with saying they weren't planning a bake sale.
The algorithms for facial recognition fall into two categories--
geometric, which focuses on features, and photometric.
So how long does this program usually take to find a match?
A few minutes.
A few... days.
Forever.
This is the Essex Street subway platform.
And this is where Boston rapid transit
keeps the wireless routers that control the signal lights
and the switches for the west side.
So maybe Mr. Laptop was trying to break in to the router
to disrupt traffic, even crash a train.
Hello.
Oh, I'm sorry. Kent Drake.
Vince Korsak.
Kent is doing a rotation here before taking over
as the assistant medical examiner in Springfield.
You two have a lot in common. You're both ex-military.
Vietnam?
Spanish-American war.
That's funny.
At least my shoes have laces.
I hate him.
So, are we narrowing the search?
Yes, but the trick is
to not narrow it so much that you exclude the subject.
This one didn't.
John Stanton.
Six months ago, his house was seized,
eminent domain,
and he was arrested for trying to set fire to a bulldozer.
Guy with a cause collected a few cohorts.
Who took his house?
BRT.
His house was in the new path of the southern spur of the subway.
Detective Hitchcock told me that,
even if you had a warrant, I shouldn't let you in.
Hardly seems sporting.
Or legal.
I got to call in.
I've got a warrant, and I'm not gonna let you stop me,
But you call internal affairs.
I don't want you getting in trouble.
Good man.
Well, I'm not trying to...
We got about 15 minutes.
A router isn't gonna give us much --
an IP address, a log of who accessed it.
John Stanton has been completely off the grid for two months.
A PI address and a log is more than we had.
IP address.
What'd I say?
PI address.
That'd come as no surprise to you
that I often don't know what you're talking about.
Weird.
What?
Someone's pinging this location, trying to get a response.
Can you tell where they are?
Shouldn't take more than 15 minutes.
Y-y-you can't see who it is, though.
No, but I have a name
and a pretty good idea of what this is about,
so that's enough for me to catch him.
Thanks, Jane! Okay.
Okay! Lots of feelings.
I get it, yeah. Okay.
Oh, God!
Okay, yeah.
Okay, wait for it.
It's Korsak. He wants you to meet him.
All right, the hug's over, Frankie.
You okay to get a ride back to the precinct?
No problem.
Have you seen him?
We don't know who's in there.
Nina just said someone inside that restaurant
is pinging the router at Sean Hughes' house.
You know IAD is gonna go ballistic if we arrest someone.
This totally throws a monkey wrench
in their plan to pin this on Frankie.
I know.
Well, I would understand if you wanted to stay here.
Up yours, Rizzoli.
I'm ready.
Cecil.
Nice to finally meet you.
I didn't have anything to do with that.
Then who did?
I don't know.
But you knew she was dead,
or you wouldn't have run from us.
Maybe I just don't like cops.
You know, we hear that a lot, usually from guilty people.
I didn't kill Mona.
Did John Stanton?
Yeah, we know about him.
We know about his beef with the BRT.
Did you know that Sean died?
So that leaves you and John
as the only two people that we get to put in jail
for whatever stupid thing that you had planned,
but you're the only one we got in custody.
We didn't do anything.
Not yet.
Do you think John Stanton's sitting around,
wondering how you're doing?
The minute that he puts your plan into action
is the minute that you're on the hook for it,
and her murder
and Sean's shooting.
Who doesn't like cops now?
Is everything all right?
Yes, yes.
Susie told me to get her ready
so that she can be released to her family.
Okay.
Does it make you feel any better?
What?
Does it make you feel any better
figuring out who committed the murder?
It's very satisfying using science to solve a mystery.
I don't think that answers my question.
Some cases are...
so awful that I put them away.
I choose not to think about them
so they don't color my view of the world.
But most of the time, I believe that the truth
helps the people who loved these victims.
I guess that makes me feel better.
Good answer.
Come on. You can see a gun.
Frankie didn't shoot an unarmed man.
What you just showed me doesn't prove anything.
Okay, okay, fine. How about this?
All right, Mona Carson.
This guy, John Stanton, killed her,
and we believe that Sean Hughes helped dispose of her body.
You have a very active imagination, detective.
Mona Carson is dead because she was involved
in a plan to crash a subway train
at Essex Street Station.
Do you have proof of any of this?
Meet Cecil Wilson.
Was there a plan to crash a subway train?
It was mostly John. We were --
Was Sean supposed to bring a gun to the platform?
Yes.
Now, we have solved this case for you,
and we'll let you take the credit
if you call the D.A.'s office right now
and tell them that Frankie did nothing wrong.
Where's Stanton?
I'll tell you after you make the call.
Come on. You get to take a picture with the mayor!
This is detective Hitchcock.
I need to speak to the D.A.
Okay, where's Stanton?
I have no idea.
I will tell you --
He's too smart to go to Essex Street.
Now, there are three other subway stations
with wireless routers.
What do you say we split up and find him
before he kills a bunch of innocent people?
I don't see him.
Me either.
I mean, now that we're down here,
do you think he would actually risk
getting caught on one of these platforms?
I wouldn't, not if I could avoid it.
Neither would I.
Holiday.
Hey. Is there any way that Stanton
could turn off the signal lights or switch the tracks
without ever coming down to the platform?
Maybe. He'd need a booster to amplify the wireless signal
so he could access it above ground.
What does a booster look like?
A plastic box.
Small.
He could tape it anywhere,
but he'd want line of sight for a better signal.
I'll look this way.
Okay.
Korsak, I found it.
I unboosted him.
There he is.
Put the laptop down.
You're gonna be losing a lot more than that signal.
Hey, we're heading out.
Oh, great. Have a good --
Nice!
He looks superhot, right?
I-is that a bad thing to say?
It -- it's not actionable, is it?
I mean, you don't work for me.
Okay, well, then I will meet you in the lobby.
So, the toe shoes were uncomfortable?
No.
I just don't like people making assumptions about me.
Ex-military guy puts on a slightly nerdy affect
to throw off his new colleagues.
Yeah, something like that.
Exactly like that.
I wanted to see how you'd react,
what you'd react to.
Still, it's a bit like lying, isn't it?
But we all lie in our own little way, don't we?
Have a nice evening.
Yeah, I thought he was gonna cry when you called.
Who are you kidding? He cried.
Yeah, he cried.
Don't tell him I told you.
Here we are!
Oh! What are these?
These are called the last word.
Seemed an appropriate way to celebrate our victory.
Yes.
Oh, okay.
Cent'anni.
Cent'anni.
Well, that'll put hair on your chest.
Speaking of hairy chests, where's Frankie?
He went to go pick some stuff up, he said.
He should've stuck around
to keep an eye on his liquor cabinet.
I cleaned him out.
This is a great apartment.
I just can't believe he kept it secret.
I can't believe how much I'm starting to like this chair.
Ooh! Did you bring dinner? I'm starving!
No.
I hope better.
I was, uh...
Well, I guess I was scared,
