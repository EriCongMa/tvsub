all right .
something smells good over at monica &apos;s station .
my god ! this is amazing ! you &apos;ve never made this before ?
oh , no . i don &apos;t know anything about cooking .
i had to ask what it was called when the water makes those bubbles .
hats off to the chef .
your mouth was full . i didn &apos;t hear .
hats off to who ?
the chef !
that &apos;s right !
you &apos;ll find that i don &apos;t micromanage . i don &apos;t shy away from delegating .
that &apos;s good to know . but let &apos;s stop focusing on what you don &apos;t do ..
and focus on what you do do .
what i do do ..
is create an atmosphere of support for the people working with me .
nice sidestep on the &quot; do do &quot; thing .
hardest thing i &apos;ve ever done .
oh , you gotta go !
don &apos;t worry . you &apos;re ready .
really ?
absolutely ! just fight all your natural instincts , and you &apos;ll be great .
monica , check these out .
those look like cookies .
i know , yeah . and i made them all by myself .
i mixed the ingredients , i put them in the oven , i took them out .
granted , i should have used the oven mitts , but still .
monica , my star student .
you called me that before , so i fashioned a star out of foil .
now , no pressure . if you like my cookies , you give me the star .
wow , a star !
i know you all hate me , and i &apos;m sorry , but i don &apos;t care .
okay , joey , you &apos;re up next .

i was the point person on my company &apos;s transition from the kl5 to gr6 systems .
you must have had your hands full .
that i did . that i did .
so let &apos;s talk a little bit about your duties .
my duties ?
all right .
you &apos;ll be heading a whole division , so you &apos;ll have a lot of duties .
i see .
but there &apos;ll be 30 people under you ..
so you can dump a certain amount on them .
good to know .
we could go into detail ..
no , don &apos;t , i beg of you .
all right . we &apos;ll have a definite answer for you on monday .
but i can say with some confidence , you &apos;ll fit in well here .
really ?
absolutely .
you can relax . you did great .
yeah , thanks .
i was really nervous . i &apos;m told i come on too strongly .
and then it was really hard to sidestep that &quot; duty &quot; thing .
duties ?

what &apos;s going on ? do you not like katie ?
no . no , she was nice . i mean , she was a little slutty , but who isn &apos;t ?
well , i liked her .
of course you did . you &apos;d date a gorilla if it called you lndiana jones .
did you get a fresh batch of pregnancy hormones today ?
no . it &apos;s just that .. katie bothered me .
why ? what was wrong with her ?
there was nothing wrong with her . she was lovely .
okay . so , what &apos;s the matter ?
i don &apos;t want you to date her .
why ? what , are you jealous ?
yes . and not because i want you to go out with me .
because i don &apos;t want you to go out with anybody .
it &apos;s terrible to even think this and it &apos;s inappropriate ..
but i want you to be at my constant beck and call , 24 hours a day .
i &apos;m very sorry , but that is just the way that i feel .
okay .
what ?
i won &apos;t date . i &apos;ll ..
i &apos;ll be here with you all the time .
really ?
but i &apos;m being so unreasonable .
true , but you &apos;re allowed to be unreasonable . you &apos;re having our baby .
oh , ross , thank you . thank you .
you feel better ?
no , not really . you &apos;re pressing the baby into my bladder ..
and now i have to pee .
okay .
rach ?
yeah ?

oh , rach , i was just messing around .
like you did when i had to pee ?
oh ! i knew that .
i knew that ! i was just messing with you too !
okay . because for a minute you seemed ..
