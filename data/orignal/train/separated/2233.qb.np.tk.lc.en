there is a town in maine ...
i &apos;d like a room .
welcome to storybrooke .
where every storybook character you &apos;ve ever known ...
is trapped between two worlds ...
an evil queen sent a bunch of fairy tale characters here .
and now they don &apos;t remember who they are .
victims of a powerful curse .
everything you love , everything all of you love ,
will be taken from you .
only one knows the truth ,
and only one can break her spell .
it &apos;s your destiny .
you &apos;re gonna bring back the happy endings .
you enjoy your stay .
you know , you had the same look on your face
before we bought it , too .
you couldn &apos;t see past the elderly windmill on the lawn
and said you &apos;d never buy an old lady house .
do you remember what made you change your mind ?
i see the windmill &apos;s gone .
come on . everyone &apos;s waiting .
who &apos;s everyone ?
this is gene .
good to see you , david .
how you doing ?
and this is ellen , his wife .
ellen , hi .
you , too .
and frank .
welcome home , david .
hey .
hey .
dr. whale .
hi , david .
hi .
look , i know this is a lot , but ...
it &apos;s good for you .
the smallest thing can trigger your memory .
just try and have fun .
thank you , dr. whale .
i &apos;ll do my best .
you know why he doesn &apos;t remember ?
the curse isn &apos;t working on him yet .
henry ...
david has amnesia .
which is preventing the curse
from replacing his fairy tale story
with fake memories .
right , because everyone here has fake stories
that prevent them from remembering who they really are .
right , and now is our chance to help him .
we just have to get him to remember that he &apos;s--
he &apos;s prince charming .
we just have to jog his memory
by getting him and ms. blanchard together .
didn &apos;t we just try that ?
and it woke him up .
hey .
you &apos;re the ones who saved me , right ?
oh . yeah , i @-@ i guess .
and , uh , you &apos;re also the only ones i know here .
you can hide with us .
fantastic .
thank you .
so ... you ever use a sword ?
i &apos;m sorry ?
emma , you live with mary margaret , right ?
you know if she &apos;s coming tonight ?
no , she couldn &apos;t make it .
oh .
you should go out there .
there &apos;s plenty of food .
go .
be with your husband .
i lost him once , now i have him back .
but it &apos;s like i still don &apos;t have him back .
you have no idea how that feels .
actually , i do .
i lost someone once , too .
really ?
yes .
but the love i lost , there &apos;s no bringing him back .
you have a chance here .
go to him .
you &apos;re right .
and , regina , thank you .
thank you for being such a good friend .
it &apos;s been so lonely . i &apos;m not used to having one .
neither am i.
well , like it or not ,
you have one now .
have you seen david ?
um ... he ...
no .
did you not get the invite ?
david .
here .
so i heard you resigned from the hospital .
was it me ?
because of what i told you ,
about how i felt ,
about you .
come on . don &apos;t tell me it &apos;s one @-@ sided .
you &apos;re married . it should be no @-@ sided .
what it should be doesn &apos;t matter .
whoever married kathryn-- it &apos;s not me .
i didn &apos;t choose her .
i &apos;m choosing you .
now i know you feel it . i can tell .
i know you think that we have this connection ,
but maybe ...
it &apos;s because i happened to be the person who saved your life ?
so ... why don &apos;t we leave it at that ?
next time , make sure i &apos;m really dead .
well done .
&quot; well done &quot; ?
there &apos;s an understatement .
you see what my son did to that brute ?
he just killed the unkillable .
ahh , a valiant feat , for sure ,
but it is still just a man .
can he do the same with a dragon ?
do fairies sprinkle dust ? do trolls live under bridges ?
father , relax .
i can kill whatever beast you set after me .
my kingdom is plagued by a dragon
like nothing you &apos;ve ever faced before .
he has killed every warrior that &apos;s tried to slay him .
he &apos;s yet to face me .
my kingdom needs this threat vanquished .
and my kingdom needs gold .
i &apos;m sure we can work something out .
careful . remember what happened to frederick .
your sword .
consider it a down payment .
you &apos;ll get the rest
when you deliver the dragon &apos;s head to me .
it &apos;s a deal .
forgive me if i refuse to shake on it , king midas .
come . let &apos;s discuss the details .
a toast to our fearless prince .
yeah !
no . there &apos;s no celebrating today .
this was but a simple test .
the task before us is too big , too important to make light of .
just because i was easily able to kill this brute doesn &apos;t m--
good @-@ bye , my son .
your majesty , there is no time to grieve .
if midas learns he is dead ,
he will find another warrior to slay his dragon ,
and we will never see an ounce of his gold .
yes . yes .
the kingdom must survive .
so what are we to do ?
i have asked for help .
it should be here soon .
oh , it &apos;s here .
leave us .
move .
so this is how you treat my gift ?
you really must be more careful .
he was not a gift .
he was my son .
a son i gave you .
in a deal we made .
you did me no favors .
yes ! yes , i did .
shame you and the queen couldn &apos;t conceive a child on your own .
my price for that is a pittance .
but now that she &apos;s gone , well , i assume that conceiving an heir
is out of the question ,
let alone a dragon slayer .
then let &apos;s do another deal .
bring him back .
i need my son to do this .
i &apos;ll give you anything .
anything ?
what do you want ?
there &apos;s a magic wand i desire .
it belongs to a certain fairy godmother who &apos;s patron to your family .
i wanna know her whereabouts .
done .
now tell me .
how do i bring my son back to slay the dragon ?
bring him back ?
oh , no , no . that &apos;s out of the question . he &apos;s dead .
magic can do much , but not that .
but you just said--
nothing about resurrection .
then my kingdom is lost .
i am alone .
oh , dear .
oh , dear , dear , dear , dear , dear .
did i not tell you
that i could have your son slay the dragon ?
and am i not ...
a man of my word ?
i thought you said he was gone forever !
oh , that he is .
but his brother ...
his what ?
his twin brother .
did i not mention there was another ?
you might wanna ease up
or that brillo pad &apos;s gonna press charges .
the dishes were just piling up .
this have anything to do with david stopping by ?
i saw him sulking away as i pulled up .
we just ...
um ... he just ...
yeah , i know what you both &quot; just . &quot;
and you did the right thing .
he made a pretty compelling case ...
but he &apos;s still married .
i know .
i was just at the party .
what do i do ?
you need to stop cleaning and have a drink .
here &apos;s the thing .
i don &apos;t know a lot about relationships ,
other than having many that failed .
but generally speaking ,
if you think something you wanna do is wrong ...
it is .
so ...
you gotta stay strong ,
and he has to figure out his life .
cheers .
you look different .
your hair . it &apos;s longer .
you used to always have a buzz cut .
you used to complain that long hair was itchy and hard to take care of .
i guess it grew while i was in there .
so i was gonna go to bed .
do you ... wanna join me ?
you mean , &quot; go to bed &quot; go to bed , or ...
go to bed ?
whatever you want .
why don &apos;t we just ... sit and talk some more ?
this ...
isn &apos;t right .
come on . come !
come on .
ah ! didn &apos;t see that coming , did you ?
honey !
mother . how was the market ?
it was ... interesting .
interesting ?
normally , you come back cursing the prices .
oh , well , that &apos;s still the case .
but this time , i had a very ...
interesting talk with the grain merchant .
grain ? we don &apos;t need any grain .
he has a daughter . she &apos;s ready for marriage .
he thinks the two of you would make a great couple .
mother ...
i know , i know .
i hate myself for even bringing it up .
let me guess . she has a dowry that will save the farm .
we are running out of options .
mother , please .
as poor as we are , love is one thing i can afford .
i will find a way to save this farm ,
but i won &apos;t do it by marrying for riches .
when i marry , i want it to be because i choose
to spend the rest of my life with someone i love .
when are you going to learn ?
you can &apos;t have everything .
oh , perhaps he can .
a twin brother ?
and you gave him to that man ?
we were poor , barely surviving .
and ... he came along with an offer .
one of you for the farm .
why didn &apos;t you ever tell me ?
the deal forbade us from ever speaking of it .
your father regretted the decision
the minute that man took your brother .
he carried the guilt with him to his grave .
hate to interrupt this tender moment .
time is of the essence .
mother , wait in the house while i deal with this .
what do you want from me ?
oh , not me , dear . the king .
he needs a prince to slay a dragon .
i &apos;m not a dragon slayer .
no , but your brother was .
this newfound kinship will be your salvation .
simply play the part .
the king &apos;s knights will take care of everything else .
all you must do
is deliver the dragon &apos;s head to midas .
what &apos;s in it for you ?
what &apos;s in it for me is my business .
you should be asking yourself what &apos;s in it for you .
you do this , your poor mother--
well , the king is going to make sure
she never wants for anything ever again .
your farm will be saved , and you ...
should you survive ...
you shall come home , the conquering hero !
now don &apos;t tell me you don &apos;t want that .
i don &apos;t have a choice , do i ?
oh , everyone has a choice , deary .
just make sure it &apos;s the right one .
欢迎归来 无名氏
some hell of a doctor , huh ?
no way he wakes up on someone else &apos;s watch .
hello , dr. whale .
so i heard that you resigned from the hospital .
i hope it wasn &apos;t because of me .
w @-@ why would it be because of you ?
well , our date . i never called you after .
yeah , i know .
i know . it &apos;s not classy , and i &apos;m sorry ,
but if you could find a way to get over it ,
you know where to find me .
have a good day .
ms. blanchard , may i have a word ?
of course .
i wanted to talk to you about my friend kathryn .
but more specifically , i wanted to talk to you
about her husband david .
you don &apos;t belong together .
he &apos;s not yours . he &apos;s taken . find somebody else .
i haven &apos;t done anything .
really ?
so he just up and left his wife on a whim ?
he did what ?
you don &apos;t know .
well , i suspect you soon will ,
so listen carefully , dear ,
because it &apos;s in your best interest .
stay away . he &apos;s in a fragile state .
he doesn &apos;t know who he is or what he &apos;s doing ,
and you &apos;re this close to wrecking multiple lives .
so before you do something that can &apos;t be undone ,
let him remember who he was .
there he is--our savior ,
the man who is going to tear the dragon limb from limb .
you do this , and you &apos;ll be a legend .
here . let me .
you fastened it wrong .
here . give me that .
well , how will i fight ? how will i protect myself ?
you won &apos;t .
you will stay outside the cave while we kill the dragon .
if you don &apos;t come out of this alive ,
midas won &apos;t give our kingdom any gold .
you might have the title of hero ,
but not the job .
the dragon &apos;s lair is through there .
you stay here . we &apos;ll be back .
did you know him well ?
who ?
my brother the prince .
yeah , we knew him .
he was the bravest man i ever met .
they need our help .
we stay here !
our orders are clear .
people are dying .
don &apos;t move !
stay back !
where &apos;s your sword ?
stay here .
you didn &apos;t see that coming , did you ?
careful . looks sharp .
you can &apos;t be here .
i @-@ i needed to see you .
tell me you didn &apos;t leave your wife because of me .
i do not want to destroy your marriage .
you &apos;re not . it &apos;s me .
i don &apos;t want to hurt her either ,
but the most hurtful thing to kathryn would be me pretending .
she needs someone to feel about her ...
the way i feel about you .
i &apos;m really trying hard to stay away from you ,
to do the right thing .
why is that the right thing ?
because you already have a life .
with someone i didn &apos;t choose .
the man who chose that life ,
whoever married kathryn is gone .
the man here wants someone else .
you really have to leave me alone .
is that truly what you want ?
go .
meet me tonight . at least think about it .
i &apos;ll be at the bridge where you found me at 8 : 00 .
think about it until then and then decide .
if you don &apos;t show ,
i &apos;ll know ,
and i &apos;ll never bother you again .
but if you choose this ,
if you choose us ...
you &apos;ll know where i &apos;ll be .
sometimes the cliches are true .
okay . what do you want ?
remember when i said no night shifts ?
i need you to work tonight . just this once .
why ?
i volunteer at an animal shelter ,
and the supervisor is sick ,
and someone needs to feed the dogs .
very lucky you brought a bear claw .
emma , can i talk to you for a minute ?
i &apos;ll just go patrol my office .
thanks .
he left his wife .
david--he left her .
he left kathryn .
hey . slow down .
he--he did it for me .
he wants me to be with him .
he wants me to meet him tonight .
that &apos;s ...
i mean , i &apos;m trying so hard to be strong ,
but he just keeps coming .
i mean , how do i stop it ?
you know , how do i let him down ?
what would you do ?
i &apos;d go .
what ?
he left her .
that &apos;s one thing to say that he wants you ,
but it &apos;s another to actually make a choice ,
and now he has .
that &apos;s all you can ask for .
given her new friendship with kathryn ,
i don &apos;t think regina would be happy .
all the more reason to do it .
good lord , is this really happening ?
you tell me .
he has done it , everything you asked for and more .
my son battled the dragon and prevailed .
bring it to the palace .
put it between the chimera and the mapinguari .
we did it .
we pulled it off .
yes .
now how much longer before i can return home ?
that &apos;s a discussion not for now .
from this day forth ,
may that beast &apos;s head be a reminder to us
of the valiant warrior who killed it ,
the bravest , most noble prince i have ever met .
you have earned my utmost respect .
we treasure that respect , king midas ,
just as we respect your treasure .
yes , yes . you were promised gold ,
and gold you shall have ,
but i did not get to where i am by thinking small .
i stand before you now because i dared to dream big .
i was not just looking for a dragon slayer .
i was looking for the strongest warrior in the land , a hero ,
someone who could unite the kingdoms ,
someone i would be proud to call family .
bring her .
gentlemen ...
may i present my daughter abigail ?
beyond gold , beyond anything ...
i value her most .
i promised her
i would only give her hand in marriage
when i could find a companion worthy of her ,
and now i have .
he killed the dragon ?
i guess he &apos;ll do .
and so , prince james ,
i offer you my daughter &apos;s hand in marriage .
king midas , i am humbled by your generous offer ,
but i can &apos;t honestly say i &apos;m wor--
my son . always so humble .
if you say anything but &quot; yes , &quot;
you will be responsible for the destruction
of everyone and everything in our kingdom .
you will marry this girl ,
or i will kill you .
i will kill your mother .
i will turn that farm to ash .
do you understand me ?
i &apos;ll take your silence for wisdom .
follow it . i know you &apos;ll make the right decision .
mr. nolan ?
oh , i &apos;m sorry . i didn &apos;t mean to startle you .
i was just heading home from work ,
and i saw you .
are you lost ?
yeah . yeah , kind of .
i &apos;m looking for the toll bridge .
ah , where you were found .
yeah .
trying to jog your memory ?
no , i &apos;m meeting someone .
so you made your choice .
yes .
well , i don &apos;t suppose i can convince you to change your mind .
i can &apos;t change what i feel .
no . of course not .
walk down the street to mr. gold &apos;s pawnshop .
you &apos;ll find a fork in the road . go left .
it will take you to a hiking trail that leads directly to the bridge .
thank you , uh , for understanding .
good luck , david .
i hope you find what you &apos;re looking for .
hello ?
hello ?
charming .
i &apos;m sorry ?
the mobile . isn &apos;t it charming ?
exquisitely designed , masterfully crafted .
i could get it down if you like .
no , no . no , i mean , it &apos;s--it &apos;s very nice ,
but actually i &apos;m looking for the toll bridge .
the mayor said there was a fork in the road by your shop , but ...
it seems ms. mills has led you astray .
yeah . yeah , you &apos;d think the mayor would know her own town .
one would think .
out of the door , turn right .
two blocks , you &apos;ll find the trail . can &apos;t miss it .
thank you .
see something you like ?
where did you get that ?
that old thing ?
that &apos;s been gathering dust for ... forever .
i think ...
this belonged to me .
really ?
are you sure ?
yes .
i remember .
mother .
ohh , you &apos;re back . you &apos;re alive .
yes .
i did it .
are you hurt ? i &apos;ve been so worried .
i &apos;m fine , mother , really .
oh , look at you .
look at you . you--you look like ...
like a ... oh , you look like a prince .
come inside . i &apos;ll make us some supper .
you should see the house , the farm .
the king is going to take care of us .
he &apos;s already started .
what ?
what &apos;s wrong ?
midas wants to unite the kingdoms
by marrying me to his daughter .
what ?
it makes the grain merchant &apos;s dowry
look like sheep dung .
no .
you were right to turn down that offer ,
as you must this one , too .
every day you &apos;ve been gone has shown me
it was shameful of me to ever encourage you otherwise .
your freedom to choose
is more important than anything .
i &apos;ll give up the farm .
no .
they can &apos;t force you .
yes , they can , and because of our ruse ,
midas can never really know who i am , which ...
we can &apos;t ever see each other again .
yes .
then don &apos;t do it . run away .
i can &apos;t . they will kill you .
i lose you either way .
at least i &apos;ll know you &apos;ll be happy .
i already accepted midas &apos;s offer .
i didn &apos;t come here for advice , mother .
i came here to say good @-@ bye .
there was too much at stake .
i couldn &apos;t let the kingdom suffer on my account .
i couldn &apos;t let them hurt you .
you know , you were right about one thing .
i can &apos;t have everything .
oh , my boy .
my sweet , sweet boy .
give this to your wife @-@ to @-@ be .
no , mother . i don &apos;t love her .
i don &apos;t even know her . that--i @-@ i can &apos;t take this .
just because you don &apos;t know her
doesn &apos;t mean you won &apos;t grow to love her .
true love follows this ring wherever it goes , my son .
i had it with your father .
i &apos;ve had it as your mother .
now you will have it .
take it .
no . no .
take it , and i &apos;ll know ...
even if i never see you again ...
i &apos;ll know you &apos;ll find love .
i &apos;ll know you &apos;ll be happy .
you came .
you sound surprised .
in fact , you almost sound a bit disappointed .
i remember .
kathryn ?
everything .
and you love her ?
i don &apos;t know ,
but i know i did .
i remember how i felt , and ...
i think i have to honor that .
and everything that you said to me--
is true .
i do have feelings for you , intense feelings ,
feelings i don &apos;t quite understand .
you &apos;re going back to her .
it &apos;s the right thing to do .
the right thing to do ...
was not to lead me on .
i know .
so you &apos;ve made your choice .
i &apos;m sorry .
that &apos;s okay .
i guess it just wasn &apos;t meant to be .
this is volunteering ?
plans ... changed . regina needed me to--
sleep with her ?
no .
why were you ... sneaking out the window ?
uh , because ...
she didn &apos;t want henry to know .
you did this with henry in the house ?
he &apos;s sleeping . he doesn &apos;t know .
oh , my god . i wish i was henry right now .
this is disgusting .
i really do work at an animal shelter .
you can finish my shift . i &apos;m done working nights .
you were right . i did hate that windmill out front .
you remember .
how much do you remember ?
enough .
i know we weren &apos;t at a good place when i left .
i know you thought i was leaving you , but i wasn &apos;t .
i wanted to work things out .
i just ...
needed some time .
then i had my accident and ...
got much more time than i expected .
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m sorry , too .
i know we have work to do .
let &apos;s see what happens .
i &apos;d like that .
let this mark the beginning of a new era ,
of a new kingdom ,
united and strong .
an era of mutual prosperity .
abigail , james , as i stay to work out the particulars
of our new land with king george ,
go to your new home at my palace .
we &apos;ll be along shortly ,
and the celebration will be beyond your dreams .
thank you , daddy .
i trust that you know best .
i &apos;m glad you made the right decision , son .
thank you ...
father .
come . i &apos;m tired of waiting .
well , then our journey shall begin .
i thought we might take the scenic route .
smile , son .
you &apos;re on the road to true love .
i told you the troll road would &apos;ve been quicker .
are you even listening to me ?
halt !
there &apos;s something in the road .
rough day ?
don &apos;t feel like talking .
come on . sometimes it &apos;s easier to
talk to someone when you don &apos;t give a crap what they think .
you ever walk into a situation
where you know exactly what &apos;s going to happen ?
and then you go into it anyway ...
and then when what you &apos;re afraid of happens ...
you kick yourself ,
because you should have known better .
but that &apos;s just who you are ,
so you keep punishing yourself .
no .
how do you do that ?
by never doing what &apos;s expected .
it keeps life interesting .
can i buy you a drink ?
