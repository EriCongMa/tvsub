leonard , are you in the shower ?
i can &apos;t hear you ! i &apos;m in the shower !
i asked if you were in the shower ,
but that &apos;s moot now !
what ?
moot ! rendered unimportant by recent events !
i can &apos;t hear you ! i &apos;m in the shower !
i have to skip the chitchat .
emergency .
what kind of emergency ?
you get mathematical-- 32 @-@ ounce banana smoothie ,
16 @-@ ounce bladder .
you might not want to do that .
i assure you i do .
sheldon , i &apos;m not alone in here .
what ? !
hello , sheldon .
what are you doing in there ?
she can &apos;t be in here !
we were in here first ; you can &apos;t be in here .
according to the roommate agreement ,
paragraph nine , subsection b ,
&quot; the right to bathroom privacy
is suspended in the event of force majeure . &quot;
and believe me , i am experiencing
a very majeure force .
come on , you can &apos;t wait two minutes ?
oh , leonard , let the man pee .
penny ? penny ? penny ?
what ?
move . move . move !
dr. leonard hofstadter ,
you are officially charged
with two violations of the roommate agreement .
do you waive reading of the charges ?
yeah , fine .
hang on . no .
my client does not waive reading of the charges .
cool . i &apos;ve got a lawyer .
and i &apos;ve seen her naked .
proceed .
very well .
&quot; count the first :
on or about the 28th day of april ,
the accused did knowingly and with malice aforethought
deny access to the shared bathroom in a time of emergency ,
to wit , my back teeth were floating .
count the second : the accused exceeded
the agreed upon occupancy of the shower ,
to wit , one , unless we are under attack
by water @-@ soluble aliens . &quot;
can i see the roommate agreement ?
um , it &apos;s fairly technical .
i think i can handle it .
top of her class , cambridge university .
licensed to practice law in three countries
and your face .
all right , based on a cursory reading ,
it doesn &apos;t look like you have much of a case , sheldon .
do so , do so .
oh , i &apos;m afraid not .
section seven here , on the right to enter the bathroom
in emergency situations , is not specific
as to what constitutes an emergency .
oh , that &apos;s ridiculous !
a bathroom emergency is self @-@ explanatory .
is it ? if leonard forgot to trim his nose hair ,
could he barge in while you were showering ?
irrelevant . leonard doesn &apos;t trimis nose hair .
he thinks because he &apos;s short nobody can see up there .
my point is , sheldon , the legal principle is ,
ambiguity in a contract benefits
the party that did not draft it ,
in this case , leonard .
so much for count one .
but ...
there &apos;s no buts , sheldon ; that &apos;s how the law works .
schooled !
as for the shower capacity issue ,
i cite addendum j.
&quot; when sheldon showers second , any and all measures
shall be taken to ensure an adequate supply of hot water . &quot;
i believe this supercedes the occupancy issue .
superceded !
this isn &apos;t over .
no offense , but shower sex with you
is now the second best thing that &apos;s happened today .
mmm , greek food on pizza night ?
this is the most delightfully cruel thing
we &apos;ve done to sheldon since we left that fake message
from stephen hawking on his voice mail .
seriously ?
i wish to discuss your theories of black holes .
meet me at the randy &apos;s donut by the airport at 2 : 00 a.m.
what is that you &apos;re eating ?
tonight is pizza night .
i &apos;d like to refer that to my attorney .
according to what i see here ,
thursday nights are franconi &apos;s pizza night .
yes , and when franconi &apos;s went out of business ,
we switched to graziano &apos;s .
that &apos;s interesting .
can you just switch restaurants like that , priya ?
a good question , howard .
turns out you can &apos;t .
according to the document you drew up , sheldon ,
the selection of a new takeout restaurant requires
public hearings and a 60 @-@ day comment period .
were those criteria met ?
no .
opa ! opa ! opa !
this is greek food ?
leonard , you hate greek food .
not as much as you .
fine . i &apos;m nothing if not adaptable .
i got you the lamb kabob .
thank you .
if you think about it ,
greek food isn &apos;t that far from italian food .
they share a spice palette .
and what a civilization is the greeks &apos; !
they gave us science , democracy ,
and little cubes of charred meat that taste like sweat .
penny ? penny ? penny ?
hey . what &apos;s up ?
the mean indian lady tried to make me eat lamb .
congratulations . pizza night will now be at your apartment .
order one .
oh , i &apos;m sorry , honey ,
i &apos;m meeting amy and bernadette for dinner .
but you &apos;re welcome to tag along .
a girls &apos; night ?
oh , i don &apos;t know if i &apos;m up for an evening
talking about rainbows , unicorns and menstrual cramps .
okay , suit yourself .
we &apos;ll probably be trashing priya a little .
shotgun .
okay , i &apos;d like to propose a toast to a wonderful girls &apos; night out .
fair warning-- we can get ca @-@ razy .
yeah . last week we smoked cigars
and pretended to be dragons .
really , amy ?
tobacco and alcohol ?
need i remind you not a lot of scientific discoveries were made
by people having a good time ?
why did you bring him ? he &apos;s harshing my buzz .
i felt sorry for him .
priya &apos;s giving him a hard time .
ooh , the priya bashing &apos;s starting early . yay !
okay , what &apos;s up with those pantsuits ?
i need some context .
pantsuits suck .
and that opens her up
to justifiable ridicule for wearing them .
good one , bernadette .
see ? ca @-@ razy .
you smell like baby powder .
it &apos;s talc .
but as that &apos;s a primary ingredient of baby powder ,
i understand your confusion .
oh , i &apos;m not confused at all .
you &apos;re like a sexy toddler .
i don &apos;t know how to process that .
i do .
amy and sheldon sitting in a tree .
k @-@ i @-@ s @-@ s @-@ s @-@ s @-@ i @-@ n @-@ g.
that &apos;s too many s &apos;s for &quot; kissing . &quot;
not if they &apos;re doing it for a long time .
sheldon ... have you ever kissed a girl ?
other than my mother , my sister and my mee @-@ maw , no .
but in the interest of full disclosure ,
i was once on a bus
and had to give mouth @-@ to @-@ mouth resuscitation to an elderly nun
who passed out from heat exhaustion .
every year i get a christmas card from her ,
signed with far too many x &apos;s and o &apos;s .
that doesn &apos;t count .
aren &apos;t you even a little curious ?
yeah , you &apos;re a scientist--
where is the curiosity ?
i &apos;m available for experimentation .
thank you .
not necessary .
we know everything there is to know about kissing .
it requires 34 facial muscles
and 112 postural muscles .
oh , blah , blah , blah .
give me some sugar , bestie .
i &apos;m certainly glad no one said
they were curious about aztec human sacrifice .
hey , i know-- let &apos;s take sheldon dancing .
ooh , i totally want to see sheldon dance .
i bet he looks like a spider on a hot plate .
no , thank you , but for the record ,
i &apos;m an excellent dancer .
proficient in the rumba , waltz and cha @-@ cha .
really ?
i don &apos;t see why that &apos;s surprising .
i excel at so many things .
you &apos;ve had my sourdough bread .
did you take dance lessons ?
against my will ,
in the south , preadolescent children
are forced through a process called cotillion ,
which indoctrinates them with all the social graces
and dance skills needed to function in 18th century vienna .
oh , we are so taking you dancing .
no , you most certainly are not .
well , what does your cotillion training say is expected
of a gentleman when three ladies ask him
to escort them to a dance soiree ?
i saved a nun &apos;s life ,
why am i being punished ?
take us someplace we can waltz .
where you can what ?
waltz . it &apos;s a social dance from austria
choreographed to a three @-@ four time signature .
oh , waltz .
here we go .
* i kissed a girl and i liked it *
* i hope my boyfriend don &apos;t mind ... *
what happened to you ?
shake it baby , shake it !
&lt; i &gt; muy caliente , &lt; / i &gt; sheldon !
care to dance ?
oh , i &apos;m sorry , i &apos;m engaged .
how about you ?
oh , what the hell .
how come if we &apos;re the smart people ,
we don &apos;t do this every night ?
what &apos;s 16 times 14 ?
my burps taste like cranberry juice .
and there &apos;s your answer .
would you like to come in for a nightcap ?
if you &apos;re referring to the beverage ,
you know i don &apos;t drink .
if you &apos;re referring to the hat you don
while wearing a nightshirt and holding a candle , i have one .
i have yoo @-@ hoo .
it &apos;s hard to say no to yoo @-@ hoo .
the name literally beckons .
make yourself comfortable .
thank you .
is someone smoking ?
oh , that &apos;s just ricky .
you own a smoking monkey ?
don &apos;t be silly . he &apos;s one of the animals
in my department &apos;s nicotine addiction study .
what &apos;s he doing here ?
i &apos;m giving him emphysema .
the least i can do is let him hang out and watch cable .
remarkable .
aren &apos;t you worried about secondhand smoke ?
a little . the real danger is him biting
my face off while i &apos;m sleeping .
is he deliberately blowing smoke at me ?
yeah . he &apos;s kind of an ass .
thank you .
may i share something with you
that &apos;s troubling me ?
of course .
what &apos;s rattling around that big bulbous head of yours ?
priya has essentially nullified
my roommate agreement with leonard ,
making life in the apartment very uncomfortable for me .
and you want me to kill her ? done .
no , of course not .
i trained ricky how to smoke .
i can train him to shoot a poison dart .
no jury would convict us &apos; cause people love monkeys .
i understand
the alcohol has stirred up whatever it is
that makes girls go wild ...
but i really need to talk to smart amy now .
excuse me .
have you considered that your intelligence
might be the very thing causing your dilemma ?
no .
what do you think ricky over here would do
if an interloper encroached on his territory ?
well , when challenged , monkeys generally assert their dominance
through chasing , assault and a stylized penile display .
that &apos;s a little outside my comfort zone .
you &apos;re being too literal .
my point is , he would not meekly surrender to the rules ,
and neither should you .
are you suggesting i play dirty ?
yes , dirty .
dirty ... dirty ... dirty .
which brings me to our next order of business .
fascinating .
i hope you don &apos;t take what i &apos;m about to do
as a comment on what we just did .
who &apos;s to say you shouldn &apos;t be dissecting our brains ?
you really are an ass .
morning , sheldon .
oh , good , you &apos;re up .
i &apos;ve written a new and improved
roommate agreement that benefits me greatly .
i &apos;d like you to sign it .
why would i want to do that ?
excellent question .
do you remember what happened to the alien ,
played by talented character actor frank gorshin ,
in the &lt; i &gt; star trek &lt; / i &gt; episode &quot; let that be your last battlefield &quot; ?
uh , captain kirk activated the self @-@ destruct sequence
and threatened to blow up the &lt; i &gt; enterprise &lt; / i &gt;
and kill them both unless he gave in ?
affirmative .
computer , this is dr. sheldon cooper .
activate self @-@ destruct sequence .
code 1 @-@ 1 @-@ a @-@ 2 @-@ b.
self @-@ destruct sequence activated .
what are you gonna do , sheldon ,
blow up the apartment ?
that was my first thought , but all my cool stuff is here .
so what happens when it counts down ?
unless leonard signs the new agreement
in the next 41 seconds ,
this computer will send an e @-@ mail to your parents in india
saying that you &apos;re in a secret relationship
with the whiter @-@ than @-@ marshmallow @-@ fluff
leonard hofstadter .
oh , my god .
what &apos;s the big deal ?
trust me , it &apos;s a big deal .
they &apos;re gonna find out about me eventually , right ?
yeah , of course , just not today .
20 seconds .
are you ashamed of me ?
of course not .
then why can &apos;t we tell your parents ?
please , don &apos;t push this .
he does that all the time , doesn &apos;t he ? 15 .
okay , fine , sheldon , you win . turn it off .
no , he &apos;s bluffing .
i never bluff . ten .
it &apos;s blackmail !
nine .
we give up .
eight .
this is ridiculous .
it &apos;s a laptop with a full charge .
honestly , what do you see in him ?
give him what he wants or we &apos;re done .
three .
really ?
two .
okay , i &apos;ll sign it !
self @-@ destruct sequence aborted .
you may have gone to cambridge ,
but i &apos;m an honorary graduate of starfleet academy .
good morning , amy .
it most assuredly is not .
are you experiencing dehydration , headache ,
nausea and shame ?
yes .
i also found a korean man &apos;s business card
tucked into my cleavage .
what happened last night ?
ah , memory impairment ;
the free prize at the bottom of every vodka bottle .
sheldon ?
all right .
last night you gave me some excellent advice
regarding my problem here at home ,
you kissed me and then vomited on and off for 40 minutes ,
following which you passed out on your bathroom floor .
i then folded a towel under your head as a pillow ,
set your oven clock to the correct time
because it was driving me crazy ...
... and i left .
okay .
don &apos;t really know where we go from here .
i suggest we treat our relationship
as if it were a crashed computer
and restore it to the last point we both agree it worked .
terrific . thank you .
they were out of menthols !
get off my back !
not easy living with a temperamental little primate .
come on , priya , just admit i embarrass you !
