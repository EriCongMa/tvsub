it &apos;s mona . &quot; hanna won , so mona loses . &quot;
mona might be safe , but that doesn &apos;t mean she &apos;s not on on this .
we &apos;re dropping the charges against you . you &apos;re free to go .
i think that the red coat that i was chasing might have been ali .
and this is what ali wanted us to see .
they &apos;re having a celebration tonight .
and board shorts thinks that ali is gonna be there .
i think &quot; a &quot; is a guy .
you need to leave ravenswood .
we &apos;re crashing a party .
i don &apos;t like the idea of you guys being there alone .
i &apos;ll get on the next bus .
what &apos;s your name ?
caleb .
miranda .
are you running away ?
it &apos;s complicated .
you need to be careful .
yeah . i will .
one of you has been touched
by the one alison fears the most .
help her go find her uncle .
and then find me when you get home .
i love you , hanna marin .
you &apos;re not leaving , are you ?
not tonight .
what &apos;s your last name ?
rivers .
alison ? it was you , wasn &apos;t it ? in ravenswood .
i wanna come home . but you have to help me .
who are you afraid of ?
aria ?
where has she been hiding all this time ?
i don &apos;t know .
do you think she &apos;s been hiding
right here in rosewood ?
why would she be hiding ? why couldn &apos;t she just come back ?
i don &apos;t know .
you keep saying that .
because i don &apos;t know .
okay , what do we know ?
somebody tried to kill ali . they buried her in her back yard .
right , and then rrunwald pulled her out .
yeah , like a carrot .
well why didn &apos;t she just call the cops ?
which cops was she supposed to call ? wilden ? garrett ?
ali not calling the cops is the only thing i do understand .
you guys , we just found out that ali is alive .
she &apos;s really alive .
why am i not insanely happy ?
thought it was just me .
it &apos;s not .
look we can figure out ow we feel about this later .
the fact is that ali &apos;s alive .
right . and she &apos;s been hiding out this whole time .
maybe it was in rosewood . maybe it was in philadelphia .
maybe it was in nova scotia .
okay ? but the sooner we can make it okay for her to come back ,
the sooner we can sit her down in a chair
ask her what the hell is going on ...
and why she would do this to us .
ali always liked games .
what ? like she &apos;s been playing with us ?
chasing us around the game board--
like she was &quot; a &quot; ?
tell me you &apos;ve never thought that yourself .
no . that &apos;s crazy , isn &apos;t it ?
well , we have to consider every possibility , don &apos;t we ?
not the ones that make you want
to hide in the closet with a quart of ice cream .
there &apos;s someone ali is so afraid of
she can &apos;t come back .
who ?
toby said the only thing that shana was guilty of
was selling jenna &apos;s car to mona .
and cece &apos;s been busy running from the cops
&apos;cause she killed wilden .
what about board shorts ?
we don &apos;t even know if that &apos;s a real person .
it was a real person who came after me in that house .
so caleb didn &apos;t find anything in &quot; a &quot; &apos; s apartment
when he was in ravenswood ?
nothing . it was completely cleaned out .
guys , i wonder if ali reached out to anybody besides us .
such as ?
such as her brother .
maybe we should be talking to jason .
no . w @-@ we all agreed
that it was too dangerous to tell anybody .
whoever tried to kill ali &apos;s still around .
okay , but suppose jason already knows she &apos;s still alive .
at least then we wouldn &apos;t be the only ones in charge of a secret .
okay , i &apos;ve been thinking , and i have a theory .
you have what ?
a theory .
do you want to hear it or not ?
guys , don &apos;t-- don &apos;t fight in the crypt .
hey , look-- ali &apos;s not in the box .
she &apos;s alive somewhere .
but somebody is dead .
at that somebody must have been buried in the back yard
after ali was pulled out
but before the men came to set up the &quot; gaze @-@ boh &quot;
and pour the cement .
&quot; gazebo . &quot;
whatever . i @-@ it still means
that there &apos;s a girl missing somewhere .
and that girl went missing around the same time that ali did .
so , we figure out who &apos;s really in there
and connect them to someone that we do know ,
then that would solve the whole thing .
yeah , but the body that was in the box
was identified as ali .
how--how did that happen ?
i don &apos;t know how , but it was .
yeah , so , why ?
because it was important to somebody that we think it was ali .
you &apos;re right-- that &apos;s an actual theory .
apology accepted .
knock knock .
who &apos;s there ?
第四季 第十四集
still change the sheets ?
fresh linen keeps her room from getting musty .
what did you want to ask me about jason ?
uh , i @-@ i tried calling him ,
but his voicemail &apos;s always full .
do you know where he is ?
people react to stress in their own ways .
i &apos;m sure you can understand
why jason needed some time by himself .
sure .
he told me he was gonna drive across the country ,
maybe stop and visit some friends in montana .
he didn &apos;t have a set plan .
but i can reach him in case of emergency .
is this an emergency ?
no . no , ma &apos;am .
just--if he calls , tell him that i said &quot; hello . &quot;
certainly .
i think it &apos;s time that i change this comforter ,
don &apos;t you ?
yeah . guess .
no , i understand .
but the interview &apos;s already set up .
why don &apos;t i come in anyway ?
no , it wouldn &apos;t be inconvenient at all .
no .
i ... appreciate that .
thanks for the call .
bye .
do you think the bank is telling people not to hire you ?
they don &apos;t have to . people watch the news ,
read the papers .
mom , you did not kill wilden . you &apos;re innocent .
yeah , well people make a distinction
between &quot; innocent &quot; and &quot; not guilty . &quot;
don &apos;t worry . there are plenty of jobs
that won &apos;t consider me a public @-@ relations train wreck .
call your father . he wants an answer .
i &apos;m not going with him and isabelle .
it would be a lot of fun .
australia is a long ways away
from all that &apos;s been happening here .
well , isabelle thinks if she gets me below the equator ,
i &apos;ll be freed from your influence .
not much chance of that .
and besides , the water in australia runs backwards ,
and i cannot deal with that .
that &apos;s a new dimension in awkward .
and she wouldn &apos;t tell you where jason was ?
she said he wanted his private time .
what &apos;s the difference between that and hiding out ?
well , yeah . what &apos;s he got to hide from ?
well , that &apos;s what i want to ask him .
mrs. d. said she could reach him in case of an emergency .
somebody &apos;s gotta know where he is .
yeah , but we haven &apos;t heard
anything since that night at spencer &apos;s .
from who ? &quot; a &quot; or ali ?
take your pick .
no , i @-@ i &apos;m just saying that ...
quiet just makes me a little nervous .
i think you should probably hold me right now .
otherwise &apos; m going to explode ,
and you will have to explain that to the custodians .
you can &apos;t leave for that long again .
it &apos;s just a week .
no . it was more like two .
did you get any answers about your mom ?
some . not enough .
there was a time mona would &apos;ve driven right over us .
she must be making progress .
yeah . she &apos;s working on her aim .
i got off the blocks really strong .
good eight feet before i hit water .
it would &apos;ve been perfect if i had just waited that half @-@ second
for the heat to actually start .
i &apos;m sorry .
sorry for what ?
talking about swimming .
i &apos;m the one that should be sorry .
my head &apos;s just been somewhere else .
i &apos;ve noticed .
what are you thinking about ?
nothing you need to worry about .
i like worrying . i &apos;m very good at it .
it &apos;s okay . don &apos;t want you trying to fix me .
i &apos;m not trying to fix you . i just want to make you feel better .
just let me feel what i &apos;m feeling right now .
okay ?
all right .
hello , stranger .
mona .
i thought you might want a ride in my new wheels--
a victory lap in jenna &apos;s mustang ,
since she won &apos;t be needing it anymore .
kind of creepy , don &apos;t you think ?
creepy is as creepy does .
i &apos;ll think about it .
you &apos;re shutting me out again .
i can understand the others ,
but not you .
i thought we moved on ...
after what i did for you .
that &apos;s just it , mona .
i don &apos;t know if you did do it for me .
now ...
you all know the plot to jekyll and hyde ...
but you don &apos;t know the story .
that happens with great writing .
it gets turned into cliches ,
and we lose the raw power of the original .
but the original , in this case , is amazing .
stevenson was so caught up with his own story
that he wrote the draft in three days .
well , listen .
clear your mind of all the knockoffs
and make sure you &apos;re ready to discuss .
miss montgomery ?
can i see you for a moment ?
it &apos;s weird seeing her talk to ezra ,
you know , when we know she &apos;s seeing jake .
well she can &apos;t see jake when he &apos;s in harrisburg .
well , if aria wants to talk about it , she can .
but i &apos;m too overstocked on weird .
&apos;kay . show us what you got .
all right .
so they found this girl over in courtland
named sara harvey .
she went missing the same time ali did .
she &apos;s blonde . same age .
her parents think she ran off with a boy .
and her friends set up a tribute site .
why did you pick this girl ?
well , i narrowed it down .
i mean , she &apos;s sort of ali &apos;s size ,
the timing is right ,
and it &apos;s not too far away .
i don &apos;t remember ali ever saying anything about courtland .
well , she never said anything about brookhaven
or taking flying lessons , either .
should we talk to her friends ?
oh , already did . i sent them an e @-@ mail .
what did you say ?
&quot; we think your friend is in our friend &apos;s grave &quot; ?
yeah , spencer , that &apos;s exactly what i said . duh .
no , i just said that we have some things in common
and we should talk .
it could be like a support group thing .
wow . yeah . hanna , you &apos;re two @-@ for @-@ two .
who did that ?
it is an important place for every boy and girl .
it &apos;s where you and your friends come to learn
what you &apos;ll need to know
in order to prepare for life and work .
you don &apos;t just learn math and history at school .
you learn how to be good citizens .
and being a good citizen is something you learn not only--
&quot; ali , ali , oxen @-@ free ? &quot;
&quot; whoever finds her gets to keep her . &quot;
... in the hallways and cafeterias
谁找到她 就得陪着她 亲亲 -a
because being a good citizen is a full @-@ time job .
did we just get dared ?
double @-@ dog dared .
tells everybody what kind of american you are .
i wanna say something ,
and i &apos;m--i &apos;m saying this with no expectations .
i put you in an impossible position with malcolm .
i thought i could make all the pieces fit .
and ... i did that
because i didn &apos;t wanna have to give you up .
that was incredibly selfish .
i &apos;m sorry .
no . this is my apology .
one way or another ,
i think my days are numbered here .
yeah . mine , too .
i know i &apos;ve probably used up all my chances with you ,
but ...
after you graduate and we both leave this place ,
i would like to try and be the person you think i am .
what makes you think i &apos;d know where jason is ?
he is your son . he &apos;s my half @-@ brother .
please don &apos;t be sarcastic , spencer .
that &apos;s sort of like the native tongue in this house .
have you asked else where he is ?
no , not directly .
have you asked anyone indirectly ?
yeah . mrs. dilaurentis .
you drop that right now .
i just wanna talk to him .
suppress the urge .
spencer , if you think about it , you &apos;ll realize that
it &apos;s in everybody &apos;s best interest
that we just say untangled from the dilaurentis family .
dad , jason is more than just a &quot; tangle . &quot;
why is it so important to talk to him ?
because nobody has even heard from him since he left town .
i mean , i @-@ i wanna know if he &apos;s all right .
fine . if i can find out where he is ,
will you promise me you &apos;ll stay away from jessica dilaurentis
directly and indirectly ?
i promise .
was all right there in the visitors &apos; log where dr. palmer lives .
he &apos;s a popular man .
i found the names of six people who worked with him at radley .
what made you think to look in the visitors &apos; log ?
i tried to think like you .
good answer .
did you track these people down ?
most of them .
and most of them wanted to talk
as long as i didn &apos;t get them into trouble .
wait , so these people knew your mother didn &apos;t jump ,
they knew about wilden , and yet they never said anything ?
well that &apos;s because
radley is owned by a big health care company .
declodyne .
that &apos;s who pays their pensions .
okay , but why would an accident
be more damaging than saying a patient committed suicide ?
and what makes this worth bribing a police officer ?
did you try this declodyne place ?
legal is run by this woman named mainway ,
but you need an appointment to make an appointment .
why does everything always lead back to radley ?
&apos;cause radley is where everyone goes to leave their secrets--
wilden , mona , cece .
me .
but at this point , i would just be happy
if someone would officially say my mom
didn &apos;t kill herself .
did you ever see that mythbusters
where they proved that a mouse can scare an elephant ?
okay , so , i talked this girl tina--
well , on the computer ,
and she wants to meet us .
us ?
all of us ?
yeah . as many &quot; us &quot; as we can get .
i don &apos;t wanna do this alone .
well , you should have thought about that before you hit &quot; send . &quot;
em , what &apos;s the matter with you ?
there &apos;s nothing the matter with me .
wait--
have you forgotten that ali &apos;s alive
and she &apos;s counting on us
to make rosewood safe for her to come back ?
that &apos;s right . ali &apos;s alive .
she &apos;s been alive the whole time and didn &apos;t tell us .
she talked to us but she never told us she was alive .
hey , you &apos;re not the only one
who feels like she &apos;s been playing &quot; hide and seek &quot;
since junior year .
yeah . i mean , sometimes i imagine her
wet and scared in a cardboard box
by some train tracks .
and , other times i see her in a penthouse ,
dripping diamonds and laughing at us .
but ... we don &apos;t know
which one &apos;s the truth .
none of us do .
so we have to bring her back .
you got pretty while i was away .
i &apos;m saving it all up for you .
god , i &apos;m glad you &apos;re back .
i &apos;m so glad to be here .
you know i said i would come to you .
i know . i ...
just--me coming here is less complicated .
less complicated how ?
i &apos;m sort of ...
keeping multiple promises to people right now .
trust me , it &apos;s less complicated .
well , is everything okay ?
i mean , how &apos;s miranda ?
she &apos;s good--
um , under the circumstances .
just the ... family stuff with her ,
it &apos;s , um , extremely complicated
well , you fixed them , right ?
i &apos;m trying .
the thing is , hanna , um ...
the reason i came back ...
i missed you .
i missed touching you .
and i missed kissing you .
i missed watching you walk barefoot cross the kitchen floor .
i thought i &apos;d go crazy missing you .
let &apos;s get out of here .
mrs. mainway ?
you &apos;re a hard woman to see .
that &apos;s because i &apos;m very busy .
too busy to save your company a couple million dollars
snd a lot of bad press ?
is your name cavanaugh ?
yes , it is .
it was the four of us :
sara , claire , avery , and me .
when sara disappeared ,
it was like all of a sudden , the center was gone .
we know what you mean .
yeah , ali was sort of the middle for us .
sara was the reason we were all friends .
there &apos;s always this one girl
who just seems to be everything
and have everything .
and out of nowhere , she decided to talk to you .
she makes you special .
avery thinks sara &apos;s still out there somewhere
with amnesia or something .
one day she &apos;ll just show up out of the blue ,
walk back into our lives ,
and wonder what all thewas about .
avery couldn &apos;t make it today .
she had to do something .
did the four of you guys ever go to rosewood ?
you &apos;ve got that funky little movie theater .
we went there a couple of times .
it &apos;s like she kept us all on hold
when she disappeared .
left us dangling .
that sounds like she did it on purpose .
she didn &apos;t .
something happened to her .
that &apos;s what everybody thinks .
except avery .
she &apos;s the one who saw her last .
on labor day ?
day after labor day .
the day after ?
the first day of school ,
avery saw sara riding on her bike
out to the big park we have .
they found the bike but not sara .
is it different ...
knowing she &apos;s dead ?
it &apos;s different .
but it &apos;s not easier .
mr. fitz !
you always have a book in your hands .
oh , d-- seems that way .
i wanted to tell you
i &apos;m having a lovely time with jekyll and hyde .
oh . it &apos;s just so gruesome
in a really good way .
oh , i &apos;m--i &apos;m happy you &apos;re enjoying it .
i &apos;m happy you &apos;re back teaching .
so am i.
spencer and emily think you &apos;re the best .
so does aria .
i &apos;m a little envious .
&quot; envious &quot; ?
of the other girls .
the support they get ,
how they depend on you .
makes me think how much better i &apos;d be doing
if i found the right mentor .
someone at radley thought this should be covered up .
and they got a police officer to do it .
that &apos;s a great deal to assume based on one document .
well , there &apos;s more where that came from .
what is it that you want , mr. cavanaugh ?
i want everybody to know
my mother did not commit suicide .
well , i-- i don &apos;t really know
how we could help you with that .
someone at a sanitarium you own
paid detective wilden to alter his report .
radley is just one facility
in the declodyne family .
well i bet it causes more trouble than most .
a loss like this--
closure &apos;s difficult .
look , you need closure , too .
preferably before your next stockholder meeting .
meaning what ?
meaning if we &apos;re here ,
you probably have more problems with this place .
maybe even worse .
it &apos;s all conjecture .
you can &apos;t prove any wrongdoing with what you have .
well we don &apos;t need to prove anything .
we just have to go on the internet and say it .
the dates don &apos;t work .
what do you mean they don &apos;t work ?
someone saw this girl sara after they poured the cement .
crap . yeah ,
&quot; crap &quot; is right .
hey , we &apos;ll talk later , okay ?
right .
hello , hanna .
everything okay ?
i think so .
i &apos;m going to work for mrs. dilaurentis
in the real estate office .
you are ?
i need someone in there .
i will get you the copy of my real estate license .
you made my mom so happy .
when i found out that she wasn &apos;t working at the bank anymore ,
i figured t wasn &apos;t her choice .
people in this town can be very intolerant .
well , thank you .
it wasn &apos;t my idea .
alison suggested it .
wait--ali did what ?
she still shows up ...
in my dreams .
she wanted me to help .
such a great comfort , seeing her .
you shouldn &apos;t sell yourself short , mona .
you &apos;re a strongly motivated student .
i &apos;ve had to be . i mean ,
i &apos;ve had a rather dickensian life up until now ,
full of folly , and grudges ,
and false imprisonment ,
people thinking i &apos;m one thing
when i know i &apos;m something else .
but you know all about that sort of thing .
what makes you say that ?
just a feeling .
maybe it &apos;s the books you have us read--
all the masks and secret identities .
that reading list is very revealing
if you know what to look for .
and what are you looking for , mona ?
what did the count of monte cristo want ?
do you think you &apos;re entitled to that much revenge ?
you &apos;re in that school every day .
you &apos;ve seen what &apos;s happened to me .
and i know about some of the things
you &apos;ve made happen to others .
&quot; he who is without sin , &quot; mr. fitz .
let me tell you what i &apos;ve learned about rosewood high :
is that fear is the number @-@ one motivator .
and i wish it was love of knowledge , but it &apos;s not .
it &apos;s fear--
fear of failure , fear of being discovered ,
fear of liking the wrong person .
you figured that out ,
and somewhere along the way , you dumped all that fear .
and that &apos;s what makes you special .
&quot; special &quot; ? moi ?
but it also makes you vulnerable .
see , fear can be a very good thing , mona .
it can keep you from underestimating people
and keep you from making mistakes
about how far you can push someone
before they push back .
well ,
i knew i could count on you for good advice .
well feel free to talk to me any time .
she said she talked to ali in her dreams .
maybe she does .
no , it can &apos;t be real .
i mean , she &apos;s talking to herself , isn &apos;t she ?
i , uh--i &apos;m not as quick on the draw as i used to be
when it comes to reality .
what do you mean ?
it &apos;s complicated .
you know , you &apos;ve been saying that a lot lately
when you don &apos;t want to answer a question .
&quot; it &apos;s complicated . &quot;
things are complicated .
may not want them to be , but they are .
all kinds of things happen that we &apos;re not expecting .
it &apos;s hard to explain .
try me .
ravenswood turned into more than i thought it would .
yeah , i know . that &apos;s why i &apos;m glad that you &apos;re out of there .
hanna , i might have to go back .
what do you mean , &quot; might &quot; ?
i have to go back .
no , you don &apos;t .
i do .
i told you i made some promises .
what kind of promises ?
and don &apos;t say that it &apos;s complicated .
just ... some stuff that i have to take care of .
that &apos;s all .
you ever think about being a lawyer ?
only in my worst nightmares .
how do you feel about this ?
i feel like i should tell my dad .
you should .
i will .
have more important things to do right now .
hey , dad .
hey .
toby .
mr. hastings .
your mother &apos;s wall @-@ to @-@ wall depositions ,
so we &apos;re on our own tonight .
okay .
your daughter is very smart .
i know .
i mean , she &apos;s a genius .
radley sanitarium has to admit my mom wasn &apos;t a suicide .
it was a cover @-@ up .
&quot; an exhaustive internal investigation
&quot; found oversight issues .
appropriate actions will be taken . &quot;
you should &apos;ve seen her .
this is declodyne .
yeah .
radley &apos;s bad for their image ,
so this gives them cover to clean up .
if they &apos;re admitting this much ,
there must be a lot more .
yeah , there is .
but this is all we really wanted .
mmm , this is good .
spencer got them to blink . but if she were a real lawyer ,
she would &apos;ve explained the sort of opportunity you have there .
you &apos;d do a lot of damage with that .
could shut the whole place down .
close radley ?
mm @-@ hmm . once and for all .
did you hear that ?
yeah . i did .
hi . thanks .
i &apos;m--i &apos;m sorry for calling you like that .
no problem .
can we go someplace ?
i know somewhere ,
if you don &apos;t mind a drive .
no . no . i don &apos;t mind .
okay .
claire ?
i remembered you said you worked here .
do you want some tea ?
and i ... check on it for my friend
when he &apos;s out of the country .
i write here when i can .
no cell service . no internet .
it &apos;s--it &apos;s close to town ,
but it &apos;s not too close .
so it &apos;s kinda perfect .
it &apos;s kinda like the place that we talked about once .
yeah . it is .
but by the time he offered me the cabin ,
things had changed .
ezra , i have to ask you a question .
what do you want ?
right now ...
a time machine .
we could ...
start over and i could avoid all the mistakes .
somebody might say that we were the big mistake .
i don &apos;t buy that .
i &apos;m seeing someone .
i know .
mr. hackett watches me like a prison guard .
i &apos;ve noticed .
and ... i swear i would strangle maggie
if i ever got the chance .
it &apos;s--it &apos;s not just that things have changed .
they &apos;re all just inside out , and i ...
i wake up and i have to lie there for a couple minutes just--
just trying to remember what &apos;s real .
we could have this place .
that &apos;s real .
for how long ?
i don &apos;t know .
it could be our secret .
i wanted you to know why avery wasn &apos;t there today .
you said she was busy .
busy sleeping .
mostly that &apos;s what avery does now .
they keep adjusting her meds .
it just gets worse the longer sara &apos;s gone .
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m sure alison
was a great person .
but sara wasn &apos;t .
she was pretty , and poised , and perfect . and ...
everything she gave you ,
she took two things away .
i @-@ i can &apos;t talk like this to the others ,
i &apos;m saying it to you .
why me ?
seeing you today made me so jealous .
&quot; jealous &quot; ?
that your friend is dead .
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m terrible .
but that &apos;s what i keep thinking .
you &apos;re done . you &apos;ve--
you &apos;ve got your life back .
not us .
she &apos;s gone but she &apos;s not gone .
and we can &apos;t get away from her .
and i &apos;m so tired of being sara &apos;s friend .
just ... sucks the life out of you .
i understand how you feel .
no , you don &apos;t .
i wished sara was dead before she disappeared .
i told you i am a terrible person .
i have to go .
no , you don &apos;t .
it &apos;s time .
no ! it &apos;s not .
your watch is broken .
it &apos;s late .
well then take me with you .
i can &apos;t .
then i &apos;ll follow you .
don &apos;t .
is this about miranda ?
it &apos;s not like that .
like what ?
like what you &apos;re thinking .
what am i thinking ?
i mean , i @-@ is this about
the girl i told you to look after ?
she needs me .
but it &apos;s not like that sounds .
you say that , but what am i supposed to think ?
i @-@ i can &apos;t tell you what to think .
i don &apos;t even know what i &apos;m thinking .
all i know is that i have to go ,
and you have to say .
it &apos;s best for the both of us .
hanna .
please don &apos;t do this .
do what ?
what am i doing ?
i @-@ i &apos;m standing in front of my own door in my own house .
i &apos;m sorry . i have to go .
why am i supposed to make this so easy for you ?
this is not easy .
god , i gave her to you .
i &apos;m so stupid .
you are not stupid .
that is not what happened .
well then what happened ? tell me what happened .
i can &apos;t .
is this how it works ?
they just leave ?
&quot; it &apos;s not you ; it &apos;s me . &quot; and then ...
they &apos;re just out the door .
no .
what are you doing ?
just trying to help .
toby doesn &apos;t want your help .
no , i think he does . now .
why are you suddenly so interested in closing down radley ?
mmm , actually been thinking about it for quite a while .
place is outdated and dangerous .
toby &apos;s mother probably isn &apos;t the only victim of that place .
you figured that out .
it &apos;s why you were able leverage that letter out of them .
so what do you get out of this public service ?
spencer , i saw you in that place .
you can &apos;t tell me you wouldn &apos;t like to see
it taken apart brick by brick .
so you &apos;re doing this for me ?
i &apos;m touched .
i always do what &apos;s best for my family .
ali let me kiss her ... once .
i &apos;m not so sure i want to hear this .
i &apos;m not so sure i want to tell you , but ...
i have to say it out loud .
she let me kiss her ,
and ... i thought it was this incredible gift .
now i know it wasn &apos;t .
what changed your mind ?
i realized it didn &apos;t mean anything to her .
i don &apos;t think she ever loved anybody .
i don &apos;t think she knew how .
she just collected love from other people .
she &apos;s been gone so long ,
and you &apos;re still thinking about her .
because she broke my heart .
i mean , really ...
like , i @-@ i could hear it crack inside me .
i hate her for being so mean to you , so cruel .
cruel would mean she cared what she was doing .
i don &apos;t think she did .
is this how you finally start to say &quot; good @-@ bye &quot; to her ?
i guess it is .
look , whatever happens ,
i &apos;m not gonna let that be the way we say &quot; good @-@ bye . &quot;
bye .
good @-@ bye .
you &apos;d ... forget your head if it wasn &apos;t attached .
i &apos;m not gonna forget anything .
so we still don &apos;t know who &apos;s in there .
we just know that it &apos;s somebody .
somebody &apos;s daughter . somebody &apos;s friend .
rest in peace ,
jane doe .
guys ...
are you okay ?
no .
what is that ?
it was ali &apos;s .
she showed it to me .
it &apos;s ... sort of like a diary
but ... more like a journal where she wrote things .
where did you find it ?
i took it ... from the lair in ravenswood .
wh @-@ what ? y @-@ you &apos;ve had it this whole time ?
why didn &apos;t you show this to us before ?
because of what &apos;s in it .
because of what she said about us .
all of us .
