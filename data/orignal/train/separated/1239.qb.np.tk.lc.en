dr. rollins .
i thought i &apos;d let you know in person .
the judge set a day for the hearing .
the court can compel your friends to come ,
but they may not be sympathetic to the cause .
so this court thing ...
it &apos;s just about how we feel about charlotte getting out .
it is about a getting out .
five &quot; a &quot; free years .
what are we gonna do ?
you got involved in government first
and your mother is going to be a state senator .
your bosses are very angry .
they &apos;re not angry .
they gave me an advance on a second book .
they know what happened in south america .
college wasn &apos;t what i thought it was gonna be .
i had a hard time , when my dad died
i just couldn &apos;t see a point to it .
my family has always had a missing part .
what &apos;s missing is my sister charlotte
and now i wanna bring my sister home .
you &apos;re here to tell me if you &apos;d feel safe
should charlotte dilaurentis leave the hospital ?
no , i would not feel safe .
so that &apos;s that .
judge says charlotte can go home .
hi , ali .
did charlotte come to your hotel room last night ?
i don &apos;t know where she is .
you don &apos;t know where charlotte is ?
we went to bed and this morning she was gone .
what is she doing here ?
making sure that charlotte &apos;s really dead .
charlotte was dead when she was thrown from the bell tower .
the death &apos;s been ruled a homicide .
you &apos;ll get a call .
when did you tell jordan ?
tell him what ?
this town , charlotte
everything we went through .
she means the things she can &apos;t google .
when i knew i was falling in love with him .
hmm , liam and i aren &apos;t there yet , but ...
i know he &apos;s gonna have a lot of questions when i get back .
are you sure you should leave tonight ?
you know the cops wanna talk to us before we go .
yeah , i &apos;ve already missed a few days of work .
we all have , aria . we &apos;re staying .
okay , well , my boss asked me to come back .
you guys , this wasn &apos;t an easy job to get .
i can &apos;t lose it .
they &apos;re gonna ask us questions about that night .
yeah , we were all together
and none of us left the hotel . what else is there to say ?
i think the person the cops should really be talking to
is right over there .
can she really not sign her own name ?
i still haven &apos;t told anyone about what happened , have you ?
do we really believe she doesn &apos;t remember ?
i think she &apos;s lying .
just like she lied about having
swedish syndrome to get her sentence reduced .
stockholm syndrome . and it is a real thing .
she was never kidnapped , spencer .
she was living out in the world .
she chose to help charlotte torture us .
you know , the judge didn &apos;t see it that way .
if sara really was brainwashed , she &apos;d have a pretty
strong motive to kill charlotte . revenge .
oh , i hate to break up this party , but i gotta get going .
i &apos;ll walk you to your car .
okay .
i &apos;ll call you soon .
okay .
love you .
love you too .
hey , um , i didn &apos;t wanna say anything in front of the others
but i know that you left the hotel
the night charlotte was killed .
where did you go ?
i got up around 3 a.m. to hydrate and i saw you leave .
i had to check my messages and , um , then my phone died
so i , i had to grab my charger from my car .
then what ?
i came back to the room .
you were gone longer than that . i tried to wait up .
hanna , you &apos;re remembering it wrong .
which isn &apos;t a surprise considering how wasted you got .
i wasn &apos;t that drunk .
you threw up in a bathtub .
that was emily , not me .
look , all i &apos;m saying is
if you did go somewhere , we should know .
well , i didn &apos;t , so there &apos;s nothing to tell .
okay .
i have a plane to catch .
mom , caleb just got here .
already you &apos;re putting him to work ?
what &apos;s wrong ?
the news of charlotte &apos;s death is spreading fast .
some bloggers are trying to link you and the girls to it .
why am i not surprised ?
i am . it &apos;s a disgusting thing to do .
my opponent is running a dirty campaign .
well , how do you know that she &apos;s behind this ?
i &apos;m trying to figure out where it &apos;s coming from .
it doesn &apos;t matter . it &apos;s already out there .
and it would be a mistake for me to go
with you to your interview tomorrow .
why ?
because i &apos;d be a distraction .
honey , the &quot; rosewood observer &quot; has more class
than to pay attention to a few tasteless tweets .
mom , i &apos;m partially responsible for charlotte &apos;s getting out .
on the night that she did , she was killed .
so whichever way they spin it , her death and my association
to it will come up and it &apos;s best
if i &apos;m not with you when it does .
hey , i found a link to a blog that originated in rosewood .
it &apos;s been shared over 400 times .
maybe it is best if you skipped this one .
yeah .
i &apos;ll call my team .
and see if they can get a handle on this .
okay .
i am really afraid that she &apos;s gonna lose
this election because of me .
hey , don &apos;t say that .
i &apos;ll hack into the voting machines
and make sure that she wins .
caleb .
i &apos;m kidding .
look , they have 400 retweets .
i will get 4000 good ones by tomorrow morning .
thank you .
yeah .
i &apos;m really glad that you &apos;re here .
me too .
alison .
her burns severely limit her ability to use her hands .
she couldn &apos;t have done this .
you &apos;re taking sara off the suspect list .
i don &apos;t understand .
charlotte &apos;s death was violent .
there was a struggle .
you sure you wanna hear this ?
i need to know what happened to my sister .
her neck was broken by a blunt force trauma
before she was thrown from the bell tower .
i &apos;m sorry , alison .
we &apos;re looking at everyone , but particularly
the people charlotte targeted .
do you think your friends could have had anything
to do with charlotte &apos;s death ?
no , i don &apos;t .
you sure about that ?
that &apos;s great .
9 : 00 works .
i &apos;ll see you in the morning . thanks .
how was the service ?
um , ali said some nice things and her doctor ..
did you go to the cemetery ?
no . why ?
well , the dilaurentis &apos; plot is close to ours , so ..
no , we just left after the service .
look , why don &apos;t you come with me tomorrow morning ?
we could water the flowers and say hi to dad .
yeah , &apos; cause i don &apos;t need to see where he &apos;s buried to say hi .
okay , but you haven &apos;t seen it .
and since the funeral you haven &apos;t even seen his headstone .
i &apos;m sorry . i can &apos;t do it tomorrow .
i promised ali i &apos;d be available to her all day
and she really needs me , so ..
i &apos;m gonna take a shower .
hi .
i &apos;m sorry . i think you have the wrong room .
i didn &apos;t order that .
i did .
jordan . how did you--
i got the key from your mom . i wanted to surprise you .
i thought the magazine was going to print tomorrow .
it is , but the cops wanna talk to you
and that trumps work for me .
how are you ?
i &apos;m better now that you &apos;re here .
champagne ? what are we celebrating ?
us .
i spoke to my uncle and he has agreed to let us
have the estate for the wedding .
in the hamptons ?
wow , that &apos;s amazing , but--
i &apos;m not rushing you , but ..
... i had to come here with some good news .
i &apos;m sorry , it &apos;s just ..
between charlotte &apos;s death and the cops circling us
i feel like i &apos;m in a time warp .
i don &apos;t want you to worry about that , okay ?
i spoke to my mom &apos;s lawyer .
he has agreed to come down here go to station with you .
that &apos;s really not necessary .
i know how the cops have treated you in the past
and we shouldn &apos;t take any chances .
maybe we should just go back to new york tonight .
hanna , once the cops talk to you
and realize you had nothing to do with this
it will all be over .
i just want this day to be over .
well , just because you had a bad day ..
doesn &apos;t mean it has to end that way .
fettuccine from balthazar .
frisee salad from dean and duluca .
and a red velvet cupcake
from the greenwich bakery .
aria , hey . uh , come in .
uh , i only have a minute .
i &apos;m on my way to the airport . i just ..
i just needed to stop by and clear the air before i leave .
we didn &apos;t see each other the night that charlotte was killed .
you didn &apos;t call me . i didn &apos;t leave the hotel .
we didn &apos;t walk or talk or go anywhere .
understood ?
whatever you say , aria .
that hurt ?
no .
i &apos;ve just never been really good with needles .
oh , you &apos;ll get used to them .
the injections too .
so are you in school or working ?
um , work and school .
i &apos;ve a couple classes left before i graduate .
just hold that there , please .
so you &apos;re going to , uh , hollis ?
oh , no . pepperdine .
i &apos;m actually in san diego now though for work .
well , you live in california
but you &apos;re doing your treatments here ?
is that bad ?
travel puts a lot of stress on the body .
it &apos;s really best if you complete your treatments in one place .
will that be a problem ?
no . no problem .
i just , i really need this to work .
oh , i &apos;m sure everything will be fine .
well , see you tomorrow , okay ?
&quot; the flower was placed in her hand
&quot; to make it look like a suicide .
&quot; her fingernails were wiped clean .
so were her hands . &quot;
i &apos;m so sorry , ali .
who would do something like this ?
sara harvey .
well , the police can &apos;t see how she could push someone
off a building when she can barely hold a fork .
maybe she &apos;s lying about that .
or maybe she had help .
either way , they took her off the suspect list .
aria left town quickly .
she had to go back to work .
well , she was still angry with charlotte .
she wasn &apos;t angry . she was scared .
and she said everything that she needed
to say up on that stand .
i saw her dad this morning .
he said that she left town one day earlier than planned .
i was hoping that you guys would come to dinner tonight .
emily , caleb . jordan too .
i could really use the company .
it &apos;s been really lonely in that house .
sure .
what should we bring ?
welcome back , montgomery .
good morning , mr. greene .
staff meeting . two minutes .
be right there .
mmm . god , i missed you .
i missed you too .
and this .
what ? work ?
yeah , work .
boston . normalcy .
yeah , i still can &apos;t believe what happened .
aria , are you okay ? are @-@ are you freaked out ?
no , i &apos;m okay . kinda freaked out .
but mainly i &apos;m just glad to get back to regular life .
oh , we should get to that meeting .
yeah , we @-@ we should .
oh , how was ezra fitz ?
did you talk to him ?
briefly .
he &apos;s thinking about giving back that advance .
oh , jillian &apos;s not gonna like that .
no , she won &apos;t .
what ?
无效信用卡
is it broken ?
um , yeah , yeah . i don &apos;t know . i don &apos;t know . maybe .
you &apos;re emily , right ?
this thing can be finicky sometimes .
let me try .
i &apos;m sorry , i don &apos;t have any cash on me right now--
not a problem . really .
thank you .
are you okay ?
yeah .
yeah , i &apos;m fine . thank you .
so what should we take to alison &apos;s ? sushi ?
the only tuna you &apos;re gonna find in this town is out of a can .
then i guess thai food is out of the question too ?
unless you wanna go back to new york .
if we leave now , we can make an 8 o &apos;clock reservation .
are you worried about spending the night with alison
or introducing me to caleb ?
both .
i will be on my best behavior , okay ?
alright , keep the conversation light
and we &apos;ll leave right after after we eat .
deal ?
yeah , fine .
but if we &apos;re going there , we &apos;re not just bringing food .
the police thinks that the murder was premeditated .
that &apos;s why they &apos;re looking at us .
alright , let them look .
they &apos;ll see that you put what happened behind you
and you &apos;ve moved on .
you know it hasn &apos;t been that easy .
going to therapy isn &apos;t a strike against you .
you need a lot to overcome .
i still am overcoming it .
it &apos;s not gonna make anybody think
that you &apos;re capable of murder .
no , this might .
what is this ?
it &apos;s a paper that i wrote my sophomore year at georgetown .
&apos;each of us had to do a case study&apos;
&apos;on a unique murder and i did mine on a woman&apos;
&apos;who was killed on her wedding night.&apos;
did you know that it &apos;s human instinct to go head first
when you leap to your death ?
no .
&apos;well , it is.&apos;
&apos;and later on , they discovered that her neck&apos;
was broken before she fell .
she was found holding her bridal bouquet
and her fingernails were wiped clean .
what class was this for ?
it &apos;s for criminology .
look , that &apos;s exactly the way that charlotte died .
what if somebody knows that i wrote this paper
they know my history here and they &apos;re trying to set me up ?
spence , breathe .
being back here is making you paranoid .
nobody &apos;s trying to hurt you , okay ?
i &apos;m telling you
this is all just one big coincidence .
i don &apos;t think the police are gonna see it that way .
you told me you had a relationship with this person .
ezra fitz was my high school english teacher .
and he told you he &apos;s gonna give back the advance back ?
well ... he said he &apos;s thinking about it .
you heard about what happened to his girlfriend .
he &apos;s not in a good place right now .
no writer is ever in a good place , aria .
i thought the teacher angle would help
but perhaps that &apos;s the problem .
maybe fitz isn &apos;t taking you seriously
because you were his student .
liam , i want you to take over .
take over ?
jillian , it &apos;s not aria &apos;s fault .
&apos;she went to testify at this hearing&apos;
&apos;and there was a murder in this town--&apos;
liam &apos;s right .
i just , i got really distracted
but it won &apos;t happen again .
jillian , i know this author .
i can get through to him better than anyone else .
this isn &apos;t personal , aria .
i just want somebody to bring back the book we paid for .
liam , you can stay .
hey , sabrina .
hey , hi .
do you have a sec ?
sure .
um , ezra says that you manage the place now .
he put me in charge when he and nicole went to colombia .
they thought it &apos;d be a month long thing .
hell of a way to get promoted .
yeah . well , i won &apos;t keep you .
i just wanted to stop by and ask you a favor .
sure .
um , could you not tell anyone
that you saw me outside at the medical center today ?
i &apos;m not quite sure who i would tell .
i know , it &apos;s just my mom comes here sometimes
and my friends and ..
yeah . i won &apos;t say anything .
thanks .
emily ... i had cancer ..
... several years ago .
i didn &apos;t want people to know .
i didn &apos;t want them to think of me
as the sick girl with cancer .
but i learned the hard way you need support
when you &apos;re going through something like that .
i don &apos;t know what i would have done without my family my friends .
i don &apos;t wanna make assumptions about what you &apos;re going through .
no , i &apos;m , i &apos;m sorry , you had to deal with that
but i &apos;m fine .
and the last thing i need to do
is to give my mom something else to worry about .
okay .
okay .
hi .
you guys bring enough food ?
oh , there &apos;s more .
hey , hanna . hi , jordan .
hey , jordan .
hey .
so good to see you .
you too .
uh , jordan , this is caleb . caleb , jordan .
i finally get to meet the caleb rivers .
yeah , it &apos;s nice to meet you .
any chance you wanna help me
get the last load of food from the car ?
uh , yeah . how much did you guys bring ?
i know . i come from a big family .
always over @-@ order .
they &apos;ll be fine .
how are you doing ?
i &apos;m holding up , i guess .
i &apos;m glad everyone could make it
except for aria .
has anyone talked to her ?
uh , not since she left .
yeah , i &apos;ve called her a few times .
she hasn &apos;t returned my calls .
she &apos;s probably just busy with work .
what are you doing ?
i was just gonna make some room .
i bought those for charlotte to welcome her home .
spence .
okay . well , then the flowers can stay there .
i &apos;ll go get some serving spoons .
that was weird .
yeah , maybe she knows about us .
this is her way of pitting us against each other .
i don &apos;t know . i think she just wants her pages .
we can figure this out .
if fitz isn &apos;t taking you seriously , then i &apos;ll go--
that &apos;s not the issue .
then @-@ then what is ?
aria .
wh @-@ what &apos;s going on ?
ezra fitz is not the same person that you met
on his book tour two years ago .
but i am gonna talk to jillian
and i &apos;m gonna convince her to give me another shot .
yeah , you should .
just duck if she picks up the phone , okay ?
for how long ?
couple of weeks .
maybe a month .
my mom asked me to stick around for a while .
the salk institute won &apos;t mind ?
no .
what do you do there ?
um , we research cures .
alzheimer &apos;s , diabetes
infectious diseases .
damn .
well , you &apos;ll save &apos; em , i &apos;ll dress &apos; em .
oh , perfect .
and i think it goes in this way .
god , there &apos;s four bottles of wine
and nobody can find a wine opener .
this is not happening .
uh , it &apos;s actually , it &apos;s backwards .
i used to have one just like it .
you kinda have to angle the leaves down .
oh , the one with the scratch on it ?
yeah , it &apos;s the first piece of furniture
we put into the new place .
hanna wouldn &apos;t let go of it .
caleb ?
yeah .
um , i can &apos;t find any wine glasses .
you wanna go check the pantry for me ?
yeah .
nice .
so do you and caleb see much of each other in dc ?
uh , yeah , we do .
i mean , i don &apos;t really see much of anybody except for my phone .
but of all the people that i don &apos;t see
i don &apos;t see caleb the most .
the least .
uh , it &apos;s nice you keep in contact .
i barely see any of my friends from high school .
oh , we didn &apos;t , uh , for a while .
and then we ran into each other in madrid .
it was crazy . it was a total fluke .
i was just finishing my year abroad
and he was backpacking through europe .
i was about to get on a train in salamanca
and i heard my name and i looked up
and he was just standing there
on the opposite platform .
wow . that sounds amazing .
yeah , it was .
have you seen any wine glasses ?
ali de @-@ boozifed the place when she thought
charlotte was coming home .
but i &apos;ll help you find the wine glasses
if you help me find an opener .
deal .
jordan seems nice .
he is .
uh , congrats on your engagement .
i @-@ i meant to say that yesterday . sorry .
thank you .
so you kept the table ?
of course , i did .
look , when you left for europe
i wanted to focus on my career .
i wasn &apos;t looking for another relationship .
you seem happy .
i am .
i &apos;m glad .
uh , found them .
looks like we got what we need .
thank you . i , uh , i appreciate you calling .
ali , who was that ?
lorenzo . he said he &apos;d call with any updates .
what was it ? the update ?
time of death .
charlotte was killed around 4 : 00 a.m.
are you okay ?
lorenzo says this is good news .
they &apos;re one step closer to finding her killer .
let &apos;s say grace .
hanna , hand .
thank you , heavenly father .
for this healing food and these dear friends .
and thank you to all those who are working tirelessly
to seek justice for charlotte .
and thank you for helping the police find charlotte &apos;s killer .
and anyone who could be protecting him or her .
thank you always for your guidance and love .
amen .
amen .
amen .
that was awkward .
was that speech directed at us ?
not at us , but aria maybe .
why would ali think that aria had anything to do
with charlotte &apos;s death ?
maybe she did .
aria left the hotel the night that she was killed .
how do you know this ?
i saw her .
she left around 3 : 00 a.m. and i don &apos;t know when she got back .
let &apos;s just ask her .
well , i tried that .
she denied going anywhere but her car .
okay , well , there are surveillance cameras , right ?
in the lobby of the hotel ?
yeah .
your mom &apos;s the manager .
so maybe you could find a way
to get a look at the footage from that night .
no . i &apos;m don &apos;t do stuff like that anymore .
hanna , i know it &apos;s a lot to ask , okay ?
but how else are we supposed to make sure
that aria came back before charlotte died ?
how &apos;s alison doin &apos; ?
um , she &apos;s dealing in her own aali way .
well , i &apos;m sure it helps having you around .
showing there &apos;s a light at the end of the tunnel .
hollis medical center ? wait , you have an appointment ?
are you feeling okay ?
i &apos;m fine .
i @-@ it &apos;s just an interview ..
for grad school .
grad school at hollis ?
oh , why didn &apos;t you tell me you were applying ?
i &apos;m just exploring my options . i mean , honestly it &apos;s ..
the institute just wanted me to look into it .
okay .
so what are you thinking ?
i mean , you &apos;ve always talked about sports medicine .
you know who you should talk to ? aunt kathy .
she &apos;s a nurse practitioner .
right ?
here you go , ladies .
let me know if you need anything else .
you know , honey , if you &apos;re worried about paying
for it , you shouldn &apos;t be .
dad left you all that money for exactly this reason
and you can just take out a loan for the rest .
you know , all the work you &apos;re doing
the person you &apos;ve become
your dad would be really proud of you , emmy .
i wasn &apos;t expecting anyone .
i thought you went back to boston .
i did . i flew back to talk to you .
oh ! well , you could &apos;ve called .
my boss has this thing about how it &apos;s harder
to say no in person .
this is about the book .
drink ?
no , thank you .
they won &apos;t take back the advance .
ah ! so they are mad .
n @-@ not mad .
they just loved &quot; ostinato . &quot;
well , it made them money .
it made them feel things .
it &apos;s a really good book , ezra
and i am not just saying that to flatter you . it is .
i promise you they are not going to love the follow @-@ up .
that &apos;s it ? that &apos;s the book ? &apos;
it &apos;s as far as i got .
can i look at it ?
hey , first draft is a first draft .
i &apos;m sure it &apos;s not that bad .
that night after we saw each other
after i went back to the hotel
where did you go ?
what are you asking me ?
you know what i &apos;m asking you .
where did you go ?
home . i ..
i went home .
spence , stop worrying about the paper .
you gotta let it go .
are you sure you &apos;re okay sleeping on the couch again ?
yeah , totally .
it &apos;s a lot more comfortable than those hostel beds in europe .
can you believe that it &apos;s been three years
since we were in madrid ?
that &apos;s crazy .
i don &apos;t think i &apos;m ever gonna forgive you
for dragging me to that awful bullfight .
come on , it was not that awful .
it @-@ it was awful when you started screaming
savages at the drunk crowd .
it was terrible from the beginning .
that &apos;s why i was screaming .
it was awful .
okay .
you made me cry .
i didn &apos;t make you do anything .
you didn &apos;t stop me from crying in the street .
you were , you were pretty livid .
it was not okay .
but , hey , i redeemed myself when i snuck us into retiro park
with a couple bottles of sangria .
yeah , you did .
oh , my god , that was the most beautiful sunrise .
yeah .
it was my best night in europe .
mine too . hands down .
uh , hey , your mom asked me to ..
stick around and help with the campaign .
that &apos;s a great idea .
汉娜
let me know if you need anything .
thank you .
where does jordan think you are ?
talking to my mom .
there she is .
it &apos;s 3 : 12 .
what the hell was ezra doing there ?
so much for just going to her car .
hey , the hallway &apos;s clear
but there &apos;s a cleaning crew down the hall .
okay , hurry .
i &apos;m going as fast as i can .
what did i miss ?
aria left the hotel with ezra .
what ?
but she didn &apos;t come back with him .
it &apos;s 4 : 28 .
what time did ali say that ccharlotte was killed ?
close to 4 : 00 .
just because she came back after the time of murder
it doesn &apos;t mean that she had anything to do with it .
no , but it doesn &apos;t look good .
what do we do ? do we erase the video ?
we &apos;re not in high school , emily . we &apos;re gonna talk to aria .
she won &apos;t tell us anything .
well , she doesn &apos;t have a choice this time .
how did you know i was back ?
i saw you visiting ezra .
we know you saw him the night charlotte died .
we know you left the hotel for more than five minutes .
yeah , and by the time you came back
charlotte was already dead .
it &apos;s time to tell us what really happened that night .
you didn &apos;t have to come by .
well , you said you couldn &apos;t sleep .
ugh , i can &apos;t .
i just keep going over what i said to the judge .
god , that look on ali &apos;s face .
look , what you said was honest and brave .
so if your friends are giving you a hard time--
no , no , no , no , they &apos;re not ... at all .
they &apos;d actually wish that they &apos;d said the same thing .
i mean , that &apos;s the crazy part .
i @-@ i just thought if one of us had said no
that that would just be the end of it .
yeah , me too .
hey , can we go somewhere ?
anywhere but here .
of course .
why is everything closed ?
it &apos;s suburban pennsylvania and about 4 : 00 a.m.
yeah , i want pizza .
doesn &apos;t anybody care that i want pizza ?
you know , i know this little
bookstore cafe around the corner .
it &apos;s closed , but i happen to know the owner .
no , no , i should go . it &apos;s late .
yeah , sure .
is that alison ? looks like her car .
i think that &apos;s charlotte .
do we call someone ? do we call the police ?
no , aria . she &apos;s free now .
it &apos;s her town now as much as ours .
oh , she &apos;s free and she &apos;s already lurking in the shadows .
why the hell is she not home with ali ?
&apos;cause that &apos;s the kind of world we live in .
people like nicole disappear and charlotte gets to walk free .
ezra .
hey , are you okay ?
yeah . you know , it &apos;s @-@ it &apos;s getting late .
you should probably get back to your hotel .
yeah .
goodnight .
he told me he went home afterwards .
but ... i don &apos;t know .
he @-@ he was so angry .
aria , what is it ?
i know him .
and i know that ezra can &apos;t look me in the eye when he lies .
and when he told me he went home , he didn &apos;t ..
look at me .
well , we have to tell someone .
lorenzo , ali , anyone .
no , we don &apos;t .
now this is a giant leap .
we &apos;re talking about ezra killing someone .
i mean , until we have actual proof
we don &apos;t tell anyone anything .
it &apos;s not .
it &apos;s not a giant leap .
in fact , i think i told ezra how to do it .
ezra was on his book tour ,
we got some time to lunch .
he was still trying to figure out what he wanted
to write next and he said that he was toying around
with the idea of a murder mystery .
i had just written my paper , so i told him about the case
in detail .
maybe ezra did do this to protect you .
protect me ?
by copying some bizarre murder from the past ?
spencer , this was a public case .
you are the only two who knew about it .
he saw how upset aria was in the courtroom .
and he &apos;s still angry about what happened to nicole .
i mean , who knows what he &apos;s capable of now ?
if he did kill charlotte and the police find out ,
it &apos;s gonna look like you were involved too .
you left the hotel with ezra and you came back a half hour
after charlotte was killed .
nobody can see that security footage .
why did you show this to me ?
i wanted you to know that i wrote it .
somebody from my class could remember it
and read about charlotte and connect the dots .
what dots ?
do you know anything about what happened to charlotte ?
no .
then i &apos;m not worried .
mom , how can you not worry ?
if this gets out , it &apos;s going to ruin your campaign
if i haven &apos;t done that already .
you haven &apos;t . and it won &apos;t .
we &apos;ll get ahead of this .
how ?
caleb already started a narrative
about you being bullied on social media .
if this comes up , it &apos;ll already be diffused .
you are not a liability , spencer .
you &apos;re my daughter .
美军上校
i was in class when mom called the school .
human anatomy .
everything we went through in high school .
i thought we were done with disasters .
the next semester
nothing made sense anymore .
if you really are watching over me , then ..
i guess you know this already .
i flunked two classes
and they took my scholarship away .
after that , i , i couldn &apos;t go back there .
i flew home that summer and i was , was ready
to tell mom about everything , but ..
she was such a mess ..
and i couldn &apos;t do it .
i know that i messed up ..
okay , but i &apos;m going to fix it .
i am fixing it .
everything okay ?
yeah , i &apos;m fine .
thank you for coming over .
ali , what &apos;s this about ?
last night you asked me if i thought my friends
had anything to do with charlotte &apos;s murder .
do you wanna change your answer ?
yes .
