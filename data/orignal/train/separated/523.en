Internal Affairs
You may think that doing hot yoga after a spin class
is a good idea, but trust me, it is not.
I must be insane.
I'm Ben Franklin.
Your sponsor has told me so much about you.
Wait. You're Ben Franklin.
Don't you just love how we can be
anyone we want online?
Anyway, your sponsor asked me to check on you
because he, well, now we
are worried about your health.
Ok.
No, honey, it's not ok.
Look at you.
You look super stressed to me.
Are you stressed?
Maybe a little.
The problem is, you need to be a better manager.
I'm trying.
You've only recruited 3 members in 2 months.
Now, 5 is the magic number.
when your 5 people each recruit 5 more,
well, then you can kick back and relax.
I know. I'll get there.
When?
Next week?
Next month?
Don't jeopardize your health. You understand?
Now go get 'em.
Fine.
Hi, George.
Yeah, I talked to her.
Are you sure?
Ok.
Yeah. I know what to do.
Agent Hotchner.
Mr. Axelrod would like to see you.
Please.
Axelrod.
Thank you, Director Cochran.
Hello, Hotch.
You couldn't just call?
I could have. We'd still have to meet.
Figured I'd cut out a step.
Plus, this is more comfortable than a parking garage.
What's this about?
A joint NSA-DEA investigation into Libertad,
the online illicit drug site,
has gone south fast.
I heard about it.
Yeah, well, one DEA undercover agent's now dead,
two are missing.
Someone in the cartel made them.
It would appear so.
I'd like your team to investigate.
Why us? Surely the DEA's got leads.
True. You and your team are better.
What do you really want?
Look, someone gave up those agents.
I have good reason to believe it was
the assistant DEA director in charge of the operation,
Bernard Graff.
I need you to get the proof.
Why not go to the Office of Professional Responsibility?
It'll raise some flags.
Graff would suspect an internal affairs investigation.
You're already involved in the darknet with Giuseppe Montolo,
so you have the perfect cover.
What makes you think it's Graff?
He knows technical details beyond the scope of his job.
And there's a flash drive that never leaves his wrist.
I think it has the access code to the Libertad servers.
I did you a favor once.
Consider this repayment.
A mole hunt is ill-advised for those
who don't want to risk their own skins.
It's an old proverb I just made up.
Axelrod asked for my help.
Well, in that case, you need to start with a profile.
Now, why would a high-level official
be involved with a secret criminal enterprise?
Lure of easy money.
Boredom. Thinking he's smarter than everyone else.
Fantasy of living a different life.
I assume you want to keep this between us for now?
Yeah.
Garcia, are you ready?
Uh, hold on, please.
Yes.
See, the blue plays off the sweater.
It's complementary, but it's not matchy-matchy.
You've been here a week. Have you thought about unpacking?
It might make things a bit easier.
I took my hotplate out 'cause I was sick of the cafeteria food,
but I'm not going to be here much longer
'cause of this new case, huh?
You guys are going into the belly of the beast.
You're gonna find out who's targeting me. Am I right?
Among other things.
The darknet--that's where all Montolo's cronies live.
If anyone can find the answer,
sir, it's you guys. I know you can.
The NSA and the DEA are both involved,
so we'll be part of a joint taskforce.
Go ahead, Garcia.
Ok. Uh, 3 weeks ago
undercover DEA agent Mark Bowers disappeared.
He was based in El Paso,
but 5 days ago his body showed up in Ciudad Juarez,
just across the Mexican border.
Ciudad Juarez is one of the most dangerous cities in the world.
Not only was Agent Bowers found strangled,
but he also had another human face covering his own face.
Another human face?
Yes. I guess skinned or scalped.
I don't now what you call it,
but I couldn't put the pictures up here.
You can see them on your own tablets.
It is typical for drug cartels to use a corpse to send a message.
Yeah, body parts sent to family members.
A face on top of another face
could easily mean he's undercover or he's two-faced.
Which is bad news for the two missing agents.
They were both undercover.
Yeah, John Portman vanished a week ago.
And then Sarah Miles disappeared yesterday.
All of these agents were investigating the Libertad drug cartel.
Well, if someone knew that they were undercover,
then there has to be a mole on the inside.
Well, we have to consider all possibilities.
This cartel is in fact unique in a few ways.
Yeah, it appeared on the
darknet after the Silk Road was shut down.
It has an online
and an on-the-ground component based in El Paso.
It's run by someone named George Washington.
An identity that can be assumed by different individuals.
El Paso's just across the Rio Grande
from some of the worst drug violence there is.
Not a bad place to set up.
Yeah, you're right about that.
I mean, it'd be so easy to fly under the radar
when there's bigger fish to fry right down the road.
All right. You'll all head to El Paso
and find out what happened to the missing agents.
I will run the cyber part of the investigation from here.
Happy hunting.
John?
John, is that you?
Oh, God.
What happened?
Do you know where we are?
Sarah?
Who are you?
What do you want with us?
Why are we here?
"The enemy is within the gates.
"It is with our own luxury, our own folly,
our own criminality that we have to contend."
Marcus Tullius Cicero.
Sarah Miles, one of the missing DEA agents,
has two young children, age 3 and 5.
I can't imagine what kind of sacrifices
she had to make to go undercover.
We all do what we have to.
She may have thought the Libertad assignment
wasn't as dangerous as infiltrating
one of the bigger Mexican syndicates.
Speaking of which, Mark Bowers, the dead DEA agent,
his body was found 50 yards away from a mass grave
filled with enemies of the Sinaloa cartel.
So was disposing his body there
a forensic countermeasure
to throw suspicion on a different group?
It could be. The area's been a battleground
for the Juarez, Gulf, and Sinaloa cartels.
Plus a lot of smaller gangs and splinter groups are formed,
all with shifting alliances.
Yeah, but why? Why launch a ground operation?
I mean, isn't an online platform enough?
Greed and hubris. Gotta think like a drug lord.
Why have one when you can have both?
You must be Agent Hotchner.
Yes, sir.
I'm assistant DEA director Bernard Graff.
Welcome to the cyber war against drugs.
We could always use the extra help,
but I'm surprised the NSA pulled you into this.
Aren't you busy hunting psychopaths
who cut up prostitutes or something?
Well, we have a case and there may be some cross-over.
You mean Giuseppe Montolo and the online hit men.
Yes. We're interested in
whoever the successor to the Silk Road may be,
and Libertad seems to fit the bill.
Well, if you ask me, the NSA's got it easy.
All they do is monitor and analyze.
But when it comes to putting away the bad guys,
you and I have to do all the dirty work. Isn't that right?
No, no.
It's not related.
Are you kidding me?
My best friend did not just have a hiking accident.
I'm out of here.
Simon.
Well, he seemed upset.
This is Adrienne Mitchell,
our head Libertad intelligence specialist.
Agent Hotchner's from the BAU.
Nice to meet you.
The man who just left was our confidential informant Simon Kahn.
He just learned his friend died.
I'll give him some space, then we talk to him again.
Our specialists have been posing online as buyers and dealers.
We made contact with Simon 5 months ago,
who alerted us to the hybrid nature of Libertad.
He's a TOR network relay operator for them.
He wants out but claims he's not being allowed to quit.
Is he being threatened?
Apparently, but we haven't seen the evidence.
Does he know who the head of the cartel is?
The real I.D. of George Washington?
No. But he does know the number two.
It took months to get him to come in.
He was close to giving us a name,
but now he's scared again.
I'd like to get my own analyst on this, if you don't mind.
She'll work out of the BAU.
By all means.
Jake, would you mind showing Agent Hotchner
where he can set up, please.
Yes, sir.
Thank you.
Thank you.
We need to find out why he's really here.
They were all posing as buyers.
Agent Bowers had been undercover the longest at 4 months.
Portman went undercover 3 months ago.
Sarah Miles, 10 weeks ago.
Any of them make contact yet?
We heard from Bowers twice,
once from Portman two days before he vanished.
There's been no direct contact from Sarah.
So how did you know they were missing?
They let us know they're ok via dead drop,
leaving a chalk mark at a designated location every 3 days.
All of them missed their check-ins.
Ok, now, you said you had contact with two of the agents.
Yes, very briefly.
But they passed along useful information.
It seems the ground crew of the Libertad cartel
are all customers who get a cut of the profits
if they recruit more customers.
Pyramid scheme. That's innovative.
We've I.D.'d some of the lower level members,
but who we really need to get to is Ben Franklin.
This individual is the nexus
between the ground operation and the internet.
We think Bowers made contact with that person,
but he was killed before we could follow up.
Have you checked in with their families?
Any of them made contact?
Funny you should ask. Sarah Miles' husband says
there was a hang-up call
from a number he didn't recognize 3 days ago.
It was the anniversary of his and Sarah's first date.
Did you trace the call?
It came from a bar just outside of town.
If it was Sarah, it would be a violation of protocol.
Chances are it was a wrong number.
Or not.
John?
Don't give up. We're gonna get out of here.
Think of your family.
Tessa.
And the boys.
They love you.
The boys...
We're still waiting on the DNA results.
I can tell you that whoever did this took his time
in carefully cutting off the face.
So the unsub had special skills.
I wouldn't go that far.
But to dissect the fascia
and reflect the musculature off the face
takes time and patience.
And this face was placed on top of Mark Bowers.
A little bit more than that.
The C.O.D. was manual strangulation.
Nothing unusual there.
But take a look at this.
This could be a case of stigmataphilia,
sexual arousal from tattoos or body piercings.
Perhaps, but it's also functional.
In order to secure the skinned face on top of this one,
the killer needed to find a way to attach it.
Was this done postmortem?
Yes.
That means the unsub
spent a lot of time with the dead body.
Not the typical M.O. of a drug cartel killer.
This feels like the unsub is getting off somehow
in taking the time to savor his kill.
And we know he likes the wet work.
Hi. Uh, we're Agents Jareau and Lewis with the FBI.
We're wondering, have you-- have you seen this woman?
She would have been here about 3 days ago.
No.
Are you sure?
She might have been in here with somebody else.
It's a bar. Lots of people coming and going in here.
Well, she's missing, so any information you can give us
will be greatly appreciated.
Sorry.
All right. Thank you.
Oh, I'm sorry. One other thing.
Who's the general manager here?
I am.
Oh, that's great. Because we actually got an anonymous tip
that somebody was skimming off the receipts,
so we're just gonna need to take a quick look at your books.
H-hold on.
I thought you were interested in a missing person.
We are. But the FBI also handles federal tax violations.
I mean, you have books, right?
'cause if you don't have books,
we're gonna have to shut this place down.
Can I see that photo again?
This one?
Ok. Yeah, you know what?
I think I remember her now.
Yeah, I--she wasn't in here very long.
She was talking to a, uh, soccer mom.
Soccer mom?
Yeah.
She was cute, like you.
Oh. Thanks.
Axelrod said you were a real straight arrow.
Like Eliot Ness reborn.
Is that your dad?
Yeah.
That's my dad.
He was in the DEA, too.
His father, my grandpa, was a G-man.
It makes you all wonder, doesn't it?
About what?
If what we're doing really matters.
In the end, we're all just government employees, aren't we?
After we're gone, someone will take our place.
New criminals replace the old.
Make you want to give it all up for a different life?
I know why you're really here.
Hornet.
Most people aren't aware
there are multiple darknets.
TOR network is just one of them.
There are over two million users on Tor,
which is slowing it down, making it too vulnerable.
A lot of operations are jumping ship
to other Darknets, like Hornet.
You think Libertad will?
Probably.
But I bet Giuseppe Montolo's hit men have already moved.
You're here because you think
we have undercover access to a Hornet router.
Do you?
No. We're still working on it.
So your presence here is premature.
Excuse me.
Yeah, Dave.
Yeah, keep me posted.
Thanks.
My team have found evidence
of a serial killer working in the El Paso area
using the drug violence as a cover.
Well, it's a good thing you're on this case, then, isn't it?
What do you want with us?
You leave her alone.
What are you doing with him?
Where are you taking--
Answer me!
John!
Oh, no!
It's, uh, Agent John Portman.
His face is, uh, missing.
I'm sorry.
He was a good man.
The coroner said he was in bad shape.
He was severely dehydrated
and had evidence of electrical burns.
So he was held and possibly tortured.
Any significance to this area?
You mean like a mass grave nearby?
No.
Agent Lopez?
Excuse me.
That means the unsub's given up on a forensic countermeasure.
It could be border control's tighter,
or he's just getting more bold and careless.
One victim was found in Mexico, the other one here.
Where's his home base?
Well, given how much easier it is for an American
to go back and forth across the border,
I'd put my money on el paso.
We need to deliver the profile.
Yeah.
We're looking for an American serial killer
who's trying to hide amid all the drug war violence.
His most recent victims,
all undercover DEA agents,
were investigating the Libertad drug cartel.
His postmortem work on his victims
requires both patience and diligence,
suggesting he's in his mid-thirties or older.
He may have a history of mental illness and hunting skills,
based on the dissection of those victims' faces.
This serial killer likely had victims
prior to the death of the DEA agents,
And those bodies were in all likelihood
hidden amongst the numerous drug cartel targets.
The killer knew our agents were undercover,
So it has to be someone from inside the cartel, right?
Well, since anyone could join Libertad,
the unsub could be a member, but it's not the only choice.
Someone on the inside could be aware of the unsub's predilection
and has been funneling new victims his way.
That person may have discovered the victims' true identities
or responded to an anomaly in the recruiting pattern.
It is possible that the DEA agents were having a
difficult time hitting their recruitment numbers.
John Portman has provided a face for the unsub.
We need to move quickly to save Sarah Miles
from being the victim who wears that face.
The first dead DEA Agent may have known who the
nexus was between the internet and ground operations.
Did you figure Graff out yet?
No. But something's definitely wrong.
I'll talk to you later.
I thought you should know I'm having the ground investigation
into Libertad suspended for now.
I understand.
You know, I've been wondering.
Instead of looking for Montolo's hit men,
have you tried looking for the Dirty Dozen?
Did Axelrod tell you about that?
Aren't we all sharing information here?
We got a problem. Simon Kahn, our C.I.,
is dead.
His car exploded outside his apartment.
He was coming to meet me.
John?
He...didn't kill me.
Oh, wait. Yes, he did.
He begged me not to hurt you.
To let you go because you're a wonderful person, he said.
Oh, please...
So I tried to feel what he felt for you,
but to be honest...
I didn't feel a thing.
Agents. DNA results are back from the M.E.
It appears the skinned face on the first victim, Agent Bowers,
belonged to Arvin Cole,
repeat drug offender, with multiple arrests
for possession of cannabis and pcp.
Is he a part of Libertad?
It's hard to tell.
Well, any drug addict would be a good candidate for Libertad.
Ok, so Arvin Cole is the one victim we know of
who wasn't a DEA agent.
Maybe he knew the unsub personally.
Hey, baby girl, I need you to look into something for me.
Tell me it's your melted chocolate eyes,
because I'm so there.
Likewise, but first things first, silly girl.
Find out everything you can on an Arvin Cole.
He's a repeat drug offender from El Paso.
Got it. Ooh! I need to tell you something that I found.
There was a serial killer investigation
among the drug cartel chaos that started back in 2011.
By whom?
A detective Morales
of Ciudad Juarez police department.
What'd he find out?
4 bodies over the course of 6 months were found,
all with their faces removed,
and the conclusion was it was probably a calling card
to a new street gang.
Ok, and now where is this detective now?
He's deceased.
He had a brain tumor in Mexico City a year ago.
Well, did anyone follow up on the investigation?
No. But detective Morales sent his report
to the El Paso police department
in case there were any similar victims
on the American side of the border.
Except there weren't any until John Portman.
All right, thanks, Garcia.
Ok, I'll hit you back when I have something.
This is Hotchner.
It's Graff. We need to talk. It's urgent.
Meet me at the Raleigh Hotel bar. I'm heading there right now.
What a mess.
It looks like suicide.
Is that his weapon?
Yeah.
He had just called me to meet him.
About what?
He didn't say.
He must have known you were about to expose him.
I didn't have anything.
You find the flash drive?
It wasn't on him.
I'm sure he felt you were getting close.
Paranoia probably got the best of him.
So where does that leave us?
We'll tear apart his life,
figure out who the other players in Libertad are
and bring it down.
But as for the missing DEA agent,
I trust your team will find her soon.
Thanks for your help on this.
We need to talk.
Graff didn't kill himself.
I know. The question is, who did?
The mole.
What do you know about a mole?
Graff told me months ago.
He's the one who alerted the NSA
that an insider might be running Libertad.
And you and Graff thought it was me,
that I came to tie up loose ends.
Yes, but then Graff said it wasn't you,
when you were genuinely surprised
that Libertad might leave the TOR network.
Do you have the flash drive?
He gave it to me for safekeeping.
He said he found something new.
Graff was storing evidence against the mole.
It looks like someone requested a police investigation file.
Someone from the NSA.
Hey, what do you have, Penelope?
I have gone through the phone and E-mail records of Arvin Cole,
the pothead and PCP user.
I can say without a shadow of a doubt
that all of his friends are real high
on the skeevy and burnout spectrum.
Except for one.
And who's that?
Jillian Carter. She looks like a regular soccer mom.
She has 3 kids.
He talked to her on the phone twice
the day before he vanished.
Soccer mom, you say?
The epitome of one.
She ran a bake sale for her team and everything.
I've just sent you her photo.
This could be who the bartender was talking about.
Garcia, we need Jillian's address.
Oh, I can do one better. I'm tracking her cell phone.
She's 5 blocks away. 220 Mason.
Climb on up.
Jillian Carter.
We're with the FBI.
The Libertad Cartel?
Is this a joke?
This is not a joke.
Listen, I'm here voluntarily,
and I appreciate everything the FBI does for our country,
but do I really look like a drug dealer to you?
You'd be surprised.
You've been positively I.D.'d as the woman
talking to a missing DEA agent in an El Paso bar.
Who I.D.'d me?
We also know you had contact with Arvin Cole,
a known drug offender.
We have his phone and email records here.
You spoke with him twice 3 weeks ago.
The following day, all of his outgoing calls and emails stopped
because presumably he was dead.
That's a mistake.
It's an old phone number.
I donate all my old cell phones,
so someone must have used it
and it was still registered in my my name.
Easily enough to solve that.
We'll just pull up the audio record
from our friends at the NSA.
Request set.
Whatever you find,
you can't prove it was me on the phone.
There's voiceprint recognition.
That's not foolproof.
See, my husband's Owen Carter.
He's one of the biggest corporate attorneys in the State.
So you're not part of Libertad for the money.
Then why do it?
I'm guessing it started as a simple addiction
to painkillers or benzos.
That you were a bored housewife
and Libertad tapped into
your hidden ambition and business skills.
My husband's gonna have a field day with you.
Hotchner.
Graff didn't kill himself.
It was Graff's gun. There was residue on his glove.
They weren't his gloves. They were too big.
He was very meticulous.
Ok.
He was set up.
Do you have proof?
Not beyond his dead body and the urgent call he made to me.
All right, so my hunch was off.
Partly.
The head of Libertad is definitely an insider.
And the evidence points to you.
I'm going to give you one chance to come clean.
If it is you, make no mistake, I will take you down.
Do you recognize that number?
No.
But it's an NSA prefix.
Someone called Simon Kahn from this number
a half an hour before he was killed.
It could have come from any NSA office. It wasn't me.
A year ago, someone from the NSA
requested a file transfer from the El Paso Police Department.
It was about a serial killer investigation that started in Mexico.
This came from an onsite server.
It means whoever requested this
was in Fort Meade December 2, 2014.
I wasn't even in the country.
I was in France at my niece's wedding.
Would you like to see the photos?
Who tipped you off about Graff?
My boss.
Right now agents are searching your house,
confiscating your computer.
Go ahead. They won't find anything.
Just means my kids can't do their homework now.
Your kids looked healthy and happy.
I gotta say, you seem like a good mother.
I am.
You think they'll agree when you're in federal prison?
I'm a white woman with no prior record.
I serve on 3 charity boards.
No jury will ever put me away.
Do you want to take that chance?
Yeah, I can't imagine having a convicted felon for a wife
will be a good thing for your husband.
But he doesn't know about your secret life, does he?
Which is why you haven't bothered to call him yet.
I'll tell you what.
Why don't we call him for you.
That is Owen Carter, right?
What do you want?
We know you're the nexus between Libertad's ground
and internet operations. Who is your contact?
George Washington.
I don't know his real name.
If you had any concerns about someone, what would he do?
He'd tell me to give them specific instructions to meet again.
They were supposed to
take the local bus number 8 to the last stop,
Esperanza Valley.
And then?
I don't know.
I never showed up to those meetings.
Well, this is charming.
Last bus of the day.
Good place for a serial killer to pick up any stragglers.
This must be a stop for migrant workers.
Probably get dropped off here and then shuttled to farms
throughout the valley.
It's not harvest season right now.
The store's closed.
Hey, mama, listen, I need you to find the owner
of the Diablo General Store in Esperanza Valley.
Okey dokey.
Uh, looks like that store has been owned
by the Dufour family for 60 years,
currently managed by Jacob Dufour.
It's closed in the Winter months.
Wait, Garcia.
Garcia, you're cutting in and out.
I got a bad cell signal out here. Hello?
Hello, can you hear me?
Yeah, yeah, I got you.
Look for residents in the immediate area with sketchy histories.
Incarceration--
Uh, you're cutting out, too,
But I think I get the drift of what you're saying.
Garcia.
Call me back.
I got cut off.
Probably the last pay phone left in the State
and it doesn't work.
All right, I'm gonna try back up the hill,
see if I can get a better signal.
I'll check out the nearby neighbors, see what they know.
You're about to get some company.
Hey, baby girl.
Where have you been? I have been calling and calling.
Calm down. Calm down. I'm here now.
Well, I didn't want you to
go try to talk to a neighbor or go to a farm.
Then you'd run into Jacob Dufour himself.
Why? What do you got on him?
Oh, I have a boatload of crazy.
He has a history of mental
illness and animal cruelty since he was a teenager.
In and out of psychiatric hospitals.
Apparently he would cut the
heads and the pelts off of various animals
and he'd wear them, and said he wanted to know
what it felt like to be in someone else's skin.
Garcia, where does Dufour live?
The farm closest to the store. And keep me in the know.
I want to be sure of you guys.
All right, thanks, mama.
Howdy, ma'am.
Can I help you?
You live here?
Sure do. Name's Jacob Dufour.
I'm the owner of the farm.
And you are?
Special agent Tara Lewis of the FBI --
You all right?
Fine. Fine. Just go.
Go!
Help me.
Please...
Please help me.
It's ok. It's ok. It's ok.
You're gonna be all right.
You're all right.
I've got you. I've got you.
Don't leave me, please.
I've got you, I've got you. I've got you.
Oh, please.
Agent Hotchner.
This is a surprise.
Director Cochran.
My team found the serial killer
responsible for murdering the drug enforcement agents.
His name is Jacob Dufour.
Excellent.
I envy the work the BAU does.
It must be so satisfying.
Dufour wasn't working alone.
He had a helpful partner
putting the victims into his hunting zone.
Dufour didn't even know they were DEA agents.
Who was the partner?
You.
Me.
And how is that possible?
In 2011 there was a local investigation
into a serial killer who
was taking advantage of the drug violence.
You requisitioned a file
and figured out how the killer was operating.
I applaud your thoroughness, but this is really unwarranted.
There's $5 million in Bitcoin in a Panamanian bank account
that we have traced back to you.
Well, this is clearly a setup.
Axelrod, tell him. Tell him.
Take him.
Do you mind if we borrow your pen?
Something tells me the access
codes to the Libertad servers are in there.
Wait. Agent Hotchner --
You're under arrest on multiple counts of racketeering
and conspiracy to murder a federal agent.
This is a mistake!
You don't know what you're doing!
I could use a drink.
How about you?
Sure.
You know, Hotch, as long as you don't threaten
to take me down again, I think we could actually be friends.
So Libertad's been completely shut down.
Yes, but all of its competitors are stepping in as we speak.
How's Garcia doing?
She's disappointed she can't go home, but she's doing ok.
I'll bring her a new garden troll
to cheer her up when I get back.
That's a good idea.
I'll talk to you soon. Bye.
Am I right? You doing all right?
Well, uh, I don't really have a choice, do I?
No.
Well, then, yes, I am hunky dory.
I am. I'm, um...
I'm gonna put some satin sheets on that,
I'm gonna put a splash of color over there.
