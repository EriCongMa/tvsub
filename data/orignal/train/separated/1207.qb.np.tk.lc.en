we &apos;ve wanted this for so long ,
a life without &quot; a , &quot;
and ali back .
people are preparing for ali &apos;s return
and it &apos;s not with flowers and welcome home banners .
i &apos;m going back to school .
and if we just stick together , everything is going to be fine .
there was still a girl in that grave .
someone killed her .
and jessica was going to say that it was you .
i &apos;m really worried that my dad tried to stop her .
you think that your dad--
yeah .
and so does my mom .
i mean , she practically admitted it .
i can &apos;t stop thinking about shana &apos;s family .
every time i close my eyes ,
all i can see is her grandmother .
you &apos;re just going to have to find a way to forgive yourself .
can &apos;t tell if this is mars or a satellite .
do you have the coordinates ?
it says we &apos;re supposed to be dressed
appropriately for the presentation .
like , business conservative ? i &apos;d rather wear vomit .
okay , but we have to find the planet
so that we can study it .
hanna ?
look , there &apos;s no rule that says
you have to walk into school with her tomorrow .
well , it &apos;s not written down but it &apos;s understood .
we &apos;re gonna walk down those hallways with ali
and everyone will think what they &apos;ve always thought .
which is what ?
that we &apos;re her puppets .
but you &apos;re not .
so who cares what they think ?
people know who you are , hanna .
they do ?
&apos;cause lately i don &apos;t .
are you still having nightmares about shana ?
i see her everywhere . everywhere .
it &apos;s like she &apos;s haunting me for what i did to her .
look , all right , all right .
this isn &apos;t about shana .
this is you doing this to yourself .
okay ?
i wish i could fix this for you .
and i know it &apos;s silly but ...
i keep waiting for that &quot; a &quot; message .
you know , that text that &apos;s gonna come in
with a picture of me standing over shana &apos;s dead body .
that picture doesn &apos;t exist .
you don &apos;t have to live in fear of your cell phone anymore .
no ? tell that to my right eye .
it still twitches every time i get a text .
what &apos;s she doing out this late ?
i don &apos;t know .
since she &apos;s been back she &apos;s practically lived in her bedroom .
alison ?
is this a date ?
no .
no .
ali , what are you doing ? who was that ?
oh , my dad forgot my enrollment forms on his desk .
and he &apos;s stuck at home on a call ,
so his flunky dropped me off .
i guess school is the kind of thing
that my mom handled .
i haven &apos;t had a chance to say how sorry i am
about your mom .
do you want me to talk to your dad ?
good luck finding him .
he &apos;s avoiding me like the plague .
does alison know ?
what you think he did to her mom ?
it &apos;s not the kind of information
that i want to arm her with
until i know for sure that he did it .
so if action is character , then who is alison now ?
been reading fitzgerald ?
i &apos;ve been re @-@ reading fitzgerald .
i already know alison &apos;s story
but i find it hard to picture her as a victim .
she seems really genuine when she says
that what she &apos;s been through changed her .
and i want to believe her .
but you don &apos;t .
how can i believe a story that i haven &apos;t been told ?
i mean , if the truth is in the details ,
we still don &apos;t know what happened to her .
spencer , we wouldn &apos;t be us
if we didn &apos;t believe in second chances .
but it &apos;s okay to close the door
on someone if they &apos;re toxic .
it &apos;s jenna .
i didn &apos;t know you two were talking again .
we &apos;re not .
i haven &apos;t talk to her since she moved to new york .
hello .
i &apos;ll be right there .
what &apos;s going on ?
shana is dead .
she could hardly get out the words ,
but jenna said she was murdered .
i &apos;m sorry , spence .
okay , nobody likes lying to toby .
but if he finds out what happened in new york ...
just tell him the truth .
if you &apos;re lying to protect me , you don &apos;t need to .
it &apos;s your decision , spencer . it &apos;s not hers .
alison , you don &apos;t have to stand watch .
spencer said that toby was taking her home .
jenna &apos;s not coming here .
he said she sounded broken .
she &apos;s still full @-@ on blind , right ?
maybe she came back
&apos;cause she wants to be close to her family .
hey , no offense , but if she &apos;s sad
she could cry in new york .
let &apos;s face it ,
we blinded jenna , we killed her girlfriend .
she &apos;s back to punish us for it .
said with absolutely no tact but you &apos;re right .
i had no idea that jenna was living in new york .
which means that shana was lying
when she said that jenna didn &apos;t know that she was after us .
she came home to finish what shana started .
and i still don &apos;t have time for a hobby .
what ?
the new normal was supposed to be a carefree senior year .
&quot; a &apos;s &quot; dead and we &apos;re still plotting
our zone defense in the dark .
you guys have put up with so much to help me .
and i &apos;ve made a lot of enemies .
but it &apos;s not going to be us against them tomorrow .
just like i &apos;m working to earn back your trust ,
i &apos;m going to try and make amends with everyone i hurt .
does that include jenna ?
i &apos;ve been through a lot worse .
you can do this .
maybe she &apos;s not coming .
oh , she &apos;s coming .
we should have picked her up .
why didn &apos;t we pick her up ?
her dad wanted to drop her off .
guys , i don &apos;t think she &apos;s coming ,
i think she &apos;s here .
you guys coming this weekend ?
yeah , i &apos;m planning on it .
once a bitch , always a bitch .
hey , ali , remember me ?
do they love her or do they hate her ?
i can &apos;t tell .
wait , ali knows cindy and mindy ?
hey , cindy . hey , mindy .
she used to call them &quot; gayrons . &quot;
gayrons ?
yeah , like gay morons .
so that &apos;s the queen of mean ?
i can &apos;t watch this .
you &apos;re leaving ?
ready ?
thanks for waiting for me .
ali , do you know where your first class is ?
i &apos;m supposed to go to the guidance counselor &apos;s office .
but i can &apos;t remember where it is .
i &apos;ve got chem lab .
it &apos;s close . i can walk with you .
thanks , em .
well , i hope you have a good first day back .
yeah .
call us if you need us .
we &apos;ll meet up for lunch , okay ?
thanks .
for everything .
i can &apos;t believe she &apos;s actually back in school .
as abnormal as this is , it kind of feels normal .
baby steps .
spencer hastings ,
please report to the office .
spencer hastings ,
please report to the principal &apos;s office .
mom ?
honey , i &apos;m sorry to have to do this at school .
what &apos;s going on ?
we have to go home and pack .
what for ?
i &apos;m leaving your father ...
and you &apos;re coming with me .
let &apos;s do something that nobody else in this school is doing today ,
talk about somebody other than alison .
gladly .
so my girlfriend is coming into town from philly tonight .
i &apos;m having a party so she can meet all my friends .
i didn &apos;t know you had a girlfriend .
what &apos;s she like ?
see for yourself .
the party starts at 7 .
can i bring travis ?
of course .
great . see you later .
is melissa coming with us ?
you need a jacket .
and that gray sweater that you love ,
let &apos;s bring that .
mom !
look , i will answer all of your questions
when we get to the hotel .
but right now i need you to stay focused on
helping me get us out of here .
mom , i need you to be honest with me .
i will help you but i need to understand
what we &apos;re running from .
we &apos;re not running .
you pulled me out of school
so that we could be gone before dad gets home .
does he even know that we &apos;re leaving ?
damn it , spencer . when you latch onto things ...
i just want to know the truth !
your father did take me to a spa .
but i never checked in .
i was working with a private investigator .
then the night that jessica was killed ,
your dad and melissa told me that they went to a diner in ridgeville .
that was a lie .
you think that both of them ...
i thought your father and i had an understanding .
we always agreed that , no matter what ,
we would never involve you and melissa in all of the ...
all of the what ?
mom ?
i want you to know that i &apos;ll take care of you .
we &apos;ll take care of each other .
spence , call us back .
we &apos;re getting worried .
i haven &apos;t seen ali since first period .
maybe they skipped .
no , ali sent a text .
she &apos;s in guidance counselor hell .
with everything going on with spencer &apos;s family ,
i don &apos;t like not knowing where she is .
i was thinking about going to jenna &apos;s after school .
i can swing by spencer &apos;s .
okay , back up . why would you be going to jenna &apos;s ?
because i believe what toby told spencer .
and if jenna &apos;s broken because of what i did ...
i don &apos;t know , maybe there &apos;s something
i can do to help .
what could you do to help ?
yeah , last night you thought
she was staring blind daggers at you .
both of you , back off , okay ?
i &apos;m just saying , if she &apos;s not looking for us
or smelling for us , then
look , hanna , i really hope that you find a hobby .
and i hope you have a carefree senior year , em .
but i &apos;ve got to find a way to live
with what i did in new york .
okay , aria ...
i can be sorry for her loss .
all right ? that &apos;s what i can do .
the glee club &apos;s sponsoring frozsing @-@ a @-@ long tonight .
导致其发挥失常
i think i &apos;m more of an adele dazeem than idina menzel .
it &apos;s free pizza on a school night .
you sure that doesn &apos;t trump 20 questions with your mom ?
is it okay if i hum ?
i &apos;ll see you at 7 ?
yeah .
i &apos;m surprised you came to practice .
i heard you went home early .
i wasn &apos;t feeling well . but it passed .
are you sure you didn &apos;t leave because of alison ?
i know she &apos;s your friend , but even being
in the same room with her makes me feel sick .
well , if you &apos;re staying out of school to try and avoid her ,
then she still has power over you .
then she still has power over me ...
because i can &apos;t stand to be in the same room with her .
i hate seeing you so upset .
i &apos;m fine .
no , you &apos;re not .
you &apos;re one of the bravest people i know ,
and i &apos;m not going to let you forget that .
jenna ?
jenna ?
who &apos;s there ?
is someone there ?
do you want me to leave ?
it &apos;s okay if you stay .
paige ?
it &apos;s up to you , emily .
thanks for getting us together , em .
paige and i are both lucky to have you as a friend .
that &apos;s the only thing we have in common .
paige ...
i am ashamed of the way i treated you .
i put people down to ...
feel better about myself .
you are a terrible person , alison .
and i hated you for it .
i didn &apos;t care if you were dead .
i was happy you were gone .
i &apos;m sorry .
for what you did to me or for yourself ?
for all of it .
i can &apos;t believe you can think about homework tonight .
and that you would trust me to give you your assignments .
you were actually the first person
that i thought of when she said that she was leaving him .
&apos;cause i remembered how hard it was for you
when your dad left .
i can &apos;t believe he &apos;d risk everything to kill mrs. d.
the police were asking questions about
the girl that was in ali &apos;s grave ...
and he was just trying to protect me .
he thought mrs. d. was gonna set me up to take the fall for it .
travis is downstairs .
spencer , i saw your mom at the bradbury yesterday .
is everything okay at home ?
yeah , we &apos;re just having plumbing issues .
ohh . well , tell veronica we &apos;re here to help
if you need anything .
thanks , mrs. marin .
spence , you could have told her the truth .
not about the murder part ,
but about your parents splitting up .
she would never judge that .
i &apos;m not really even sure why i lied .
i know that we &apos;ve never really been
like a warm and fuzzy family ,
but i always thought that my parents were gonna stay together .
we &apos;re here for you , spence .
i promise .
you want to order some food ?
uh , i already have plans .
it &apos;s a school thing .
can i tag along ?
i invited paige .
so ...
yeah , i get it .
so i &apos;m sure this sounds lame , but do you care
if i stay for a little bit ?
my dad &apos;s working late , and i just ...
i don &apos;t want to go home to an empty house .
yeah .
my mom &apos;s in the den if you need anything .
em ?
when i was talking to paige
i realized that i owe you an apology , too .
i always made you think that your feelings for me
were totally one @-@ sided .
that wasn &apos;t true .
those kisses weren &apos;t just for practice .
i don &apos;t know what you want me to say .
you don &apos;t have to say anything .
why are you telling me this now ?
i just thought you should know .
caleb ?
what are you doing here ?
hey , blondie , come hang out with us .
could you keep it down , biff ?
this is a coffee shop , not the locker room .
you looking for a fight , man ?
no , no . he &apos;s just a little bit irritable .
he hasn &apos;t had his coffee yet .
caleb , when did you get back ?
two coffees for hanna .
and ... why haven &apos;t you called me ?
hanna .
better get your coffees .
caleb , where are you ?
why aren &apos;t you answering my calls ? are you mad at me ?
can you just call me back so i can find you ?
you dropped your phone .
thank you .
god , this punch is so tasty .
it &apos;s best consumed rapidly and repeatedly .
cheers .
cheers .
so , lucas ,
where is your girlfriend ?
i ... don &apos;t see her right now .
are you sure that she &apos;s even real ?
oh , she &apos;s real , all right .
lucas , you &apos;re doing it with her !
hanna . shh !
okay , now that is consumed best rapidly and repeatedly .
whoa , you okay ?
hey , cowboy , where have you been ?
i &apos;ve been looking for you all night .
you &apos;re the one that &apos;s been on your phone all night , hanna .
lset me rub that bald head of yours .
okay , come on .
i think you &apos;ve had enough .
actually , you don &apos;t know what i think .
you don &apos;t even know the half of it .
come on , come on .
oh , there we go .
did i just say that you don &apos;t even know the half of it ?
here you go .
bridget woo just told me she saw jenna tonight .
she &apos;s probably drunk .
jenna or bridget ?
bridget .
bridget .
she also told me shana &apos;s dead .
who are these people ?
jenna &apos;s a blind girl who used to go to our school .
her and shana were dating , right ?
i don &apos;t know what they were .
you don &apos;t like her ?
alison and jenna hated each other .
my friends and i didn &apos;t realize we had been
drafted into their war before it was too late .
too late for what ?
three minutes till show time , folks .
find your seats and your duet partners .
so are you anna or elsa ?
i &apos;m humming .
i knew it was you in my room today .
you scared me .
what were you doing in my house ?
do you want to--
do you want to come inside ? i can make some tea .
what i would like is an answer .
i heard about shana .
so i was just coming to see if you were okay .
why would you care if i &apos;m okay ?
look , with ali back , it &apos;s just--
it &apos;s bringing up a lot of stuff for everyone , and ...
we all feel really terrible about our part in the accident .
i was--
placating your guilt ?
jenna ...
look , i might be the last person on earth
that you want to talk to right now .
but for two years , we felt that alison was dead .
so i know how it feels to lose someone .
right .
but you still have your friends .
i don &apos;t have anybody left .
right , but i guess that is nobody &apos;s fault
but my own .
are you sure you don &apos;t want to come in for that tea ?
i didn &apos;t really know shana that well ,
but if you ...
if you wanted to come in and talk
and tell me about her ...
i think that would help .
thank you , aria .
yeah .
求救 我在教堂
you don &apos;t scare me , mona .
you &apos;re not as good of a liar as you used to be .
i know you were all in new york
the night shana was murdered .
and i can prove it .
what do you want , mona ?
what i &apos;ve always wanted--
and that &apos;s for you to leave town .
i don &apos;t care where you go or how you get there .
i want you gone .
i &apos;m not a threat to you .
you may have convinced hanna and the others
that you changed .
and maybe you are trying to be a decent person ,
but that won &apos;t last for long .
people do change .
when someone shows me who they are ,
i believe them .
i don &apos;t need to be taught a lesson more than once .
you &apos;re suddenly the victim of what , mona ?
my bullying ?
what do you call what you did to those girls ?
you almost killed hanna .
no one feels worse about that than i do .
but i &apos;m all better now . even the doctors say so .
i don &apos;t believe you .
if you could prove that we were in new york ,
you would have done it already .
i &apos;m back and i &apos;m staying , so get used to it .
no one wants you here .
you &apos;re wrong , mona .
just like before , everyone wants to be my friend .
and that &apos;s what you &apos;re afraid of .
all i had to do was say &quot; i &apos;m sorry &quot; to cindy and mindy
and they were practically begging me
to sit at their lunch table .
you &apos;re scared because you know that
it &apos;s not gonna take me long to win over your army of losers .
i made you loser mona once ,
and you know i can do it again .
we don &apos;t have to do this .
leave me alone .
你还好吗
hey , han , we &apos;re all at ali &apos;s .
you might be asleep , but just call us when you get this .
i don &apos;t think it was a coincidence
that all of you were busy tonight .
did you see who was driving ?
it couldn &apos;t have been mona .
she got into that church way too fast .
she had help .
sounds like an ambush .
you &apos;re shaking .
hey , here .
well , what did you do when she slapped you ?
i just stared at her .
look , i think you &apos;re right .
if mona had any proof that we were in new york ,
she would have used it by now .
she was just trying to scare you .
well , she succeeded .
i would be madder than a skunk at travis
if he weren &apos;t as baffled by your behavior as i am .
when you sober up we &apos;re having a serious talk about consequences .
and yours won &apos;t just be a hangover .
okay , mother .
but if you don &apos;t stop spinning the room , i &apos;m going to throw up .
thanks for not being mad at me .
oh , i &apos;m mad at you , hanna .
but i know you won &apos;t remember ,
so we &apos;ll talk about it tomorrow .
okay , mother .
why would you do this to yourself ?
caleb &apos;s back .
ali &apos;s really missing her mom tonight .
okay . i will .
she &apos;s okay with me staying over .
she said to give you a big hug .
you probably don &apos;t remember
what i told you when i pulled you out of that barn .
i remember every word ...
but i don &apos;t know what &apos;s real and what i made up .
you said you missed me the most .
you were the hardest one to leave behind .
hey .
hey .
look , i-- i know that there &apos;s no more &quot; a , &quot;
but you should seriously still lock your door .
you stopped by paula &apos;s ?
yeah , it &apos;s key lime .
why pie ?
why not pie ?
jenna &apos;s all alone now .
she &apos;s all alone , and she &apos;s blaming herself .
i just wanted to tell her that she should blame me .
you should both be blaming shana .
she was the one that was holding the gun , remember ?
ali , she always thought that jenna was manipulating shana ,
but i think that jenna actually loved her .
look , aria , you have to stop beating yourself up for this .
i don &apos;t know how i &apos;m going to get past it .
do you see this ?
this is what she did to me .
i &apos;m lucky to be alive , and so are you .
just like she told you , remember ?
shana wasn &apos;t playing a game .
i &apos;m so sorry .
i don &apos;t ever want to hear you say
you &apos;re sorry again .
ali ? are you asleep ?
does that hurt ?
i can handle it .
if you feel as bad as you look--
not so loud .
so how does mona know that we were in new york ?
she &apos;s mona .
but how did she send that &quot; new york minute &quot; text
to your burner phone the night we got back into town ?
the other day i learned
how to make my own satellite on the web .
what are you going to do with a satellite ?
the point is that you can learn to do anything on the web .
using a bluetooth sniper rifle ,
the hacker can receive signals
from a thousand yards away .
you can be blue @-@ snarfed in seconds ,
and the entire contents of your phone will be
wirelessly uploaded .
so mona blue @-@ snarfed us ?
what &apos;s going on ?
some people really did hope that you changed .
we &apos;re not afraid of you , mona .
afraid of me ?
what lies has she told you ?
alison attacked me last night .
and when she started saying things
like she could make me disappear ,
i turned my phone to video .
you &apos;re scared
because you know it &apos;s not gonna take me long
to win over your army of losers .
i made you loser mona once
and you know i can do it again .
it &apos;s ...
that is the last time i underestimate that bitch .
how are you going to try and spin this one , ali ?
i mean , we know you &apos;re a great liar ,
so i &apos;m sure this is going to be a good one .
everything i told you last night was true .
she slapped me first . i swear it .
i didn &apos;t tell you that i slapped her back
because i felt terrible about it .
&quot; loser mona &quot; ? really ?
are we back to that again ?
i know how it looks .
but you know what she &apos;s capable of .
i mean , she set me up .
come on , guys .
mona &apos;s found a lot of ways to trick us
into believing things were real when they &apos;re not .
i mean , spence , you landed in radley
because of one of those elaborate stunts she pulled .
maybe mona deserved it .
but you went out of your way to lie to us .
again .
nice car .
it used to be mine .
they don &apos;t want things to go back to the way they were .
they remember how alison treated them .
like they were her dolls .
good .
then maybe we can really get rid of her .
so what does a world without &quot; a &quot; look like ?
well , it turns out the hastings don &apos;t need &quot; a &quot;
to make a mess of things .
we can do that all on our own .
are you mad at me for waiting so long to tell you ?
spence , get over here .
all i want you to know is that you &apos;re never alone .
not even for a second .
i thought i &apos;d find you here .
why haven &apos;t you returned my calls ?
travis is a nice guy .
i didn &apos;t come back to screw that up .
so why did you come back ?
did you change your hair because alison &apos;s back ?
probably .
em , i know i screwed up .
em , will you look at me please ?
why wouldn &apos;t you just tell us the truth ?
it &apos;s so much easier than lying .
i didn &apos;t tell you everything because i was afraid
that i was gonna lose you .
please .
that &apos;s not going to fix this .
there is breaking news tonight
in the investigation of the jane doe
who was buried in alison dilaurentis &apos;s grave .
we expect the rosewood police department
to make a statement regarding the identity
of the murdered girl .
did miranda find her family ?
i don &apos;t know .
the night you left ravenswood was the last time i saw her .
you have to come with me .
we gotta go .
caleb , come on .
... the rosewood police chief
will be making a statement any moment now ,
guys , it &apos;s starting .
announcing the identity of the body
found in the delaurentis backyard 2 years ago .
this mystery has continued to haunt rosewood
as the murder has never been solved .
and this announcement is
right on the heels of the more recent murder
of alison &apos;s mother jessica delaurentis .
and not only that , the police department
is under a lot of pressure right now
as these are not the only murders ...
are they together now ?
have you been drinking again ?
i had one sip of beer .
oh , here he comes , we &apos;re going live .
we take you now to the rosewood police chief .
good evening , ladies and gentlemen .
i &apos;ve called this press conference
because we received confirmation tonight
that the name of the victim that was buried alive
on the dilaurentis property
was bethany young .
she was a 17 @-@ year @-@ old patient at the radley institution
and was believed
to have run away from the hospital on the night
that alison dilaurentis was allegedly kidnapped .
did they just say &quot; allegedly &quot; ?
the victim &apos;s parents have been notified
and the family is requesting at this time
that you respect their privacy and allow them
to grieve over the loss of their loved one .
there will be no comments and no questions--
oh , my god !
what the hell was that ? !
are you okay ?
guys , what just happened ?
oh , my god .
my god .
toby ...
... your house .
was there anyone in there ?
toby , stay here ! please !
that &apos;s the last box .
welcome home .
all units in the vicinity ,
please respond to an explosion at 47 serenity lane .
ambulances and paramedics are en route .
