okay , five newtonian equations down .
only seven quantum mechanical proofs to go !
we are cooking with c @-@ h @-@ 4 .
cooking with gas .
and they &apos;re both single , fellas .
come on , guys . can &apos;t we just have one day
where we respect and support one another ?
hello , family .
there was an incident this morning
at our annual neighborhood block party .
cam usually provides the entertainment at these things ,
but he had lily &apos;s birthday party , so phil volunteered .
who needs a fizbo if you can have a philbo ?
what ? !
i mean , where does it end ?
it &apos;s so long ! it &apos;s comically long ,
when you think about it .
thing is , phil &apos;s terrified of clowns .
just thought if i was the clown , i wouldn &apos;t be scared .
like how you can &apos;t tickle yourself .
sebastian , no !
i got this ! sebastian !
your mom &apos;s worried about you , buddy ,
even though there &apos;s absolutely no reason to be --
smell -- oh , god .
s @-@ s-
s @-@ clowns !
honey .
they were everywhere .
i recognize that i embarrassed the family this morning ,
but i assure you that --
phil , honey , just come on over here for one second .
just a sec .
honey , you are not the first person to put on a clown outfit ,
walk into a hall of mirrors , and --
i guess what i &apos;m saying
is if you think you need to do something
to make up for that ,
don &apos;t think that .
no !
oh , my god , the computer froze !
daddy to the rescue !
well , i feel heard .
yeah , you know what , dad , i @-@ i think it &apos;s okay .
i just need to do a hard reset --
no , i don &apos;t think it &apos;s a reset issue .
i think the surge protector just blew .
i am going to plug this bad boy directly
into the wall and ..
oh , my god ! you fried my computer !
all of our work is gone !
honey , calm down . these hard drives are designed
to withstand temperatures of up --
oh , my god , it &apos;s on fire !
damn it .
what is wrong ?
huh ? nothing .
you know , i totally forgot some of my navy buddies
are meeting downtown later
for a little reunion at o &apos;brien &apos;s pub .
well , nothing special is happening here today ,
so you have permission to go .
well , i don &apos;t really need your permission .
why don &apos;t you just keep quiet and take yes for an answer ?
ay , there &apos;s my handsome , perfect , amazing boy !
still not going on the class trip .
why are you being such a dummy ? is this because i --
mom , i don &apos;t want to talk about it .
why am i the only one in this house
that ever wants to talk about things ? !
ay , papi , what is wrong ?
not now .
okay , that &apos;s it .
if the men in this house don &apos;t start talking to me ,
i swear to god that i will make life miserable
for each and every one of you !
no , not yet .
oh , don &apos;t tell me the power just went out !
my sleep number bed is stuck on the nap setting .
calm down .
this is exactly why i sprung for a new generator .
which , you &apos;re welcome , just kicked in .
now , granted , it doesn &apos;t power everything .
i had to make some hard choices .
that &apos;s it ? the bar and the pool table ?
the frigerator &apos;s black .
okay , jay , you &apos;re not leaving
until you put power in the important things .
i swear to god , don &apos;t make me more mad than i already am !
can &apos;t i just do it when i get back ?
would you stop doing that ? !
it &apos;s lily &apos;s 8th birthday ,
and we had a little backyard party planned .
hot dogs , some balloons --
you know , i mean , we really just threw it together .
kind of like my birthday party last year .
okay , you told me that you did not want me to do anything --
anyway , we were all set for a casual kids &apos; party ,
but then lily got an e @-@ mail .
she &apos;s coming ! she &apos;s coming ! she &apos;s coming ! ashley &apos;s coming !
ashley &apos;s coming ?
mitchell , ashley &apos;s coming !
oh , my god ! well , now , wait a minute .
ashley s. or ashley w. ?
&quot; w &quot; !
ashley w. &apos; s coming !
ashley is the most popular girl in lily &apos;s class .
i mean , you invite her ...
but you never think she &apos;s gonna accept .
no . something must have fallen through , or --
the point is , she decides who &apos;s in and who &apos;s out .
so we had to up our game .
which was a fun challenge .
yeah , considering it had been a while
since we &apos;d thrown any sort of fabulous birthday party .
you begged me not to make a fuss . you said --
oh , because that sounds like me , yeah .
all right . once sophie boards the bus ,
we will be on our way to the princess park ,
where we will all pick out our princess costumes !
i think ashley &apos;s having a really good time .
yeah ? how can you tell ?
she &apos;s still here .
oh , no ! is it raining ?
not to worry , sweetie . we have parasols .
it worked !
good . i powered up all your essentials .
now i &apos;m gonna go meet my buddies .
i see my espresso machine didn &apos;t make the cut ,
but i &apos;ll manage .
one of the guys i &apos;m meeting was lost at sea once .
had to eat a jellyfish .
i &apos;ll speak to him of your courage .
so , power &apos;s out . had to come over . real quick .
phil got dressed up as a clown
and then had a panic attack in a hall of mirrors ,
so he &apos;s gonna be looking to overcompensate for a lot ,
so please don &apos;t indulge in any of his --
hey , jay .
right here .
i remembered you had a generator .
i &apos;m just gonna upload a few quick files for alex .
don &apos;t ask .
i never do .
i can &apos;t open the jar .
well , lucky for you your uncle --
brother @-@ in @-@ law phil is here .
and with one mighty twi--
we should be ...
good to go .
no !
no , no , no , no , no !
no , no , no !
dad , stop helping !
hey , monster .
hey , you .
andy and i started out pretty hot and heavy ,
but , uh , the last few weeks i &apos;ve just been super busy ,
so i guess he &apos;s feeling neglected ,
and he &apos;s acting a little cold .
i mean , a chuck on the arm ?
what are we , huck finn and tom sawyer ?
those are people , right ?
ay , there &apos;s a puddle !
stella or joe .
i &apos;ll see you in a couple of hours .
no , no , no , no ! look , it &apos;s a leak ,
because it &apos;s coming through the wall .
most likely your gutters backed up .
consider it handled .
please don &apos;t ask me . please don &apos;t ask me .
luke ! to the gutters !
okay , princesses , your castle awaits !
what gives ?
the roads were starting to flood ,
so we were hoping to ride out the storm here .
yeah , sure .
also , dad , we &apos;re hoping to keep the princess theme alive ,
so if you could pretend to be a --
interested ?
no .
okay .
ladies , it &apos;s costume time ! we have ...
costumes !
belle , we have elsa , we have ariel !
costumes ?
ew , costumes .
what are we , 5 ?
okay .
uh , okay , so , that &apos;s happening .
hey , ashley hates the costumes .
you got to think of something else !
what do we do ?
well , i don &apos;t know .
our friends are basically 8 @-@ year @-@ old girls .
what would they want to do ?
dance party !
yeah ? yeah ? okay . okay , girls .
uh , let &apos;s get some music started here , huh ?
oh , god , cam , there &apos;s no power .
there &apos;s cam power .
what is that ?
well , had i listened to you and we not donated to npr ,
we wouldn &apos;t have gotten this free emergency radio
that we then re @-@ gifted to jay and gloria .
i wouldn &apos;t call $ 19 a month free , but okay .
all right , let &apos;s get a little funk in here , ladies !
okay .
little more funky energy in this thing !
got to warm up , you know ?
got to get it warmed up !
i don &apos;t know what &apos;s wrong with me .
this is my butter @-@ churning arm .
third drawer from the left .
i have no idea what you &apos;re talking about .
thank you . what &apos;s with the robe ?
i had to go outside and cover my drought @-@ resistant garden .
timing , right ?
well , anyway , there &apos;s no power in my room ,
and i wasn &apos;t gonna get dressed in the dark , so ...
how crazy is your dad , huh ? !
braving the elements !
keeping the family dry ! that is fur !
what &apos;s the plan , luke ?
there are no bad ideas ,
but waving a metal shovel around in an electrical storm
could have a downside ,
so let &apos;s put it back in the garage , huh ?
whoa , that was close !
oh , my god ! not again !
oh , honey , you &apos;re gonna be fine .
i can &apos;t believe you let him get struck again !
again ?
don &apos;t worry about it , champ .
i don &apos;t even think it hit him .
last time he smelled like aluminum .
last time ? !
honey , your father and i are trying to talk .
okay , everyone .
don &apos;t feel like you have to wait for me to get back .
jay !
the leak is growing !
i was just on my way back out .
i &apos;ll do it . - but --
sit !
that &apos;s a silly excuse not to go to your school trip .
mom , i &apos;ve made my decision .
what &apos;s going on here ?
i could cut the tension with my machete .
it &apos;s so ... nothing .
i mean manny got his robe
caught in the refrigerator door ,
and i may have accidentally seen ...
him .
oh , you saw .
okay . manny , it &apos;s over .
what happened happened .
it &apos;s done .
okay , good , because i have a problem
and i need your help , claire .
yes . you got it . what is it ?
well , manny doesn &apos;t want to go to his school trip
because there is a rumor
that the kids want to go skinny @-@ dipping ,
and he &apos;s self @-@ conscious about his body .
i &apos;m gonna pretend i don &apos;t understand
why you &apos;re including me in this conversation .
i &apos;m just saying --
you could tell him since you already peeped .
i didn &apos;t peep .
tell him that he has a beautiful body
so at least something good comes out of the peeping .
please stop saying that .
when i see luke naked , i am going to tell him ,
&quot; luke , you have a beautiful body . &quot;
&quot; when &quot; ?
maybe she doesn &apos;t think i have a beautiful body .
iay , dios mio ! claire , is this true ?
no ! okay , i can &apos;t do this .
i &apos;m -- i &apos;m just gonna go ahead and walk away now .
but if a bolt of lightning should strike this house ,
you can send it my way .
what -- they didn &apos;t like the peanut @-@ butter sandwiches ?
no . no one would touch them after ashley said ,
&quot; crunchy ? &quot;
what are you , crazy ? she &apos;s right there .
this is ridiculous .
are we really gonna let an 8 @-@ year @-@ old dictate this party ?
you know how peer pressure is .
i had an ashley when i was lily &apos;s age .
she blackballed me from the cafeteria table ,
and then no one would sit with me .
i had to eat outside with the class rooster .
and then one day ...
okay , if this ends in another case
of you almost eating one of your animal friends , i can &apos;t .
but ... okay . this is ... this is what i &apos;m gonna do .
if we get ashley on board ,
everything else will just fall into place .
i convince juries that guilty people are innocent .
i can certainly convince ashley
that our party ideas are dope .
yeah , but don &apos;t say dope .
i won &apos;t say dope .
hey , ash .
so , listen .
oh , gosh . oh , good call .
um , i &apos;m thinking about kicking this party up a notch ,
more grown @-@ up activi ...
uh , i @-@ i @-@ it &apos;s still ...
yeah . yes , it is . my word .
kind of a tweener on sizes .
and we always tend to go smaller , don &apos;t we ?
i mean , human nature , am i right ?
anyway , um , a lot of high @-@ school girls
are really just falling in love with pictionary ,
and i sort of ... um , uh ... oh , gosh .
cam bought me this shirt , and i ...
can &apos;t believe i just tried to blame cam .
mitchell , take responsibility -- you eat bread , you billow .
anyway ... your shirt is really nice , and i ...
yeah . take the call .
nobody .
bye , ash .
hey , sexy !
what &apos;s all this ?
oh , just a little something special for you and i.
i would put those away .
joe goes crazy if you play with his blocks .
maybe it &apos;s time for us to get a little crazy .
come here .
i was afraid of this .
this is why i was trying to slow things down with haley .
women are always drawn to me physically
in a very intense way .
which often fizzles out
before we have a chance to connect emotionally .
so ...
yes ?
there are so many things about you
that i just don &apos;t know .
i feel , in the book of haley , i &apos;m only in chapter one .
turn the page for me , girl .
what ?
would it help you to open up if i were to brush your hair ?
you mean in a hot way ?
i got us some wine .
you know what would be better ?
two cups of soothing green tea
to warm our emotional availability .
ooh , the places we will go . i &apos;ll be right back .
i hope this doesn &apos;t sound conceited ,
but everyone wants me .
i just knew there had to be a rational reason
andy was rejecting me .
beth &apos;s coast guard uniform .
i can &apos;t believe he &apos;s not over her .
she &apos;s a size six !
who moved my blocks ? !
okay , so , vi equals 367 meters per second ,
and d equals .00214 , so th ...
alex , did you know i was struck by lightning ?
no , no , no , no , no , no , no . not right now .
maisie , continue .
uh ... i lost it .
so ... can we talk about my thing now ?
okay , look , you &apos;re really hot ,
and under the right circumstances ,
i could see myself making out with you , but ...
but we &apos;re trying to re @-@ create
all the work that we lost on the computer this morning , so ...
also , every time you open your mouth ,
you let out a cloud of stupid over the entire room .
i don &apos;t want to be in here with you losers anyway .
and another thing ...
can we circle back to what maisie just said ?
get out !
hey . back already ?
never left .
and now the pool &apos;s a centimeter
from overflowing right in the house .
i got to pump the pool .
wait , wait , wait , wait !
jay , i want you in that bar ,
and i need to feel like a man .
let me pump your pool .
all right . one hose in the pool , the other one ...
jay , shh . it &apos;s me .
you &apos;re right . i &apos;ll do it .
no , no , no , no , no . i got it . i got it .
gloria , i &apos;ll be back in a couple hours !
what the ... son of a bitch ! who left the door open ? !
stella ! stella !
she probably got outside .
who the hell left the door open ? !
not me !
nope .
oh , god .
what have i done ?
stella ! stella ?
all set , here , jay ! working like a charm !
admit it !
you didn &apos;t think i could actually ...
oh , no , no , no . what are you doing ?
what are you doing ?
wha-- well , phil had this in his trunk
and i didn &apos;t have faith in your &quot; talk to ashley &quot; plan , so ...
so you decided to go with bleeding clown ?
well , how did your talk with ashley go ?
is your shirt stapled ?
yea ... don &apos;t worry about it .
okay , i will not have our daughter eat lunch
with a rooster for the next year .
we have a fully @-@ licensed clown right here .
and i defy
any child to not be delighted by that !
a clown .
you don &apos;t like clowns ?
please .
you know what ?
shut up , ashley !
jay ! jay .
the water is coming inside the house from the pool !
of course it is .
because phil was supposed to pump it out !
actually , there &apos;s an emergency valve .
at the north end of the pool . i know that valve .
i &apos;m gonna open that valve .
haven &apos;t you done enough already ?
please ! i need this !
and who else would dare to jump
in that pool right now anyway ?
me !
i &apos;m not sure about the rest of you ,
but i &apos;m going swimming , in the rain , in my clothes !
pool party !
i am not gonna ...
can i come ?
do whatever you want , ashley .
yeah .
is she following ? don &apos;t look back .
everybody stand back !
i opened the valve !
i &apos;m happy for her .
your husband &apos;s outside half naked .
there &apos;s still time to go downstairs
and body shame him if you like .
okay . let &apos;s you and me get this over with .
okay , you &apos;re really putting on mixed signals here .
please stop talking . okay .
of course you &apos;re insecure about your body .
you &apos;re a teenager .
it &apos;s part of the job description .
but if this whole skinny @-@ dipping thing ever even happens ,
you have nothing to worry about .
easy for you to ...
you &apos;re still talking .
you have nothing to worry about
because nobody &apos;s going to be looking at you ,
because all those other kids
are gonna be too preoccupied with their own insecurities .
but if they do ?
you &apos;ll be fine .
you &apos;re the most confident kid i have ever met ,
and that is always sexy .
thanks , claire .
and if this helps you in any way ,
i &apos;ve always found you sexy , too .
super .
stop pouting !
that &apos;s so not you .
who cares that you dressed up as a clown ,
then scared yourself in many mirrors ?
actually , what &apos;s even more embarrassing
is that i thought if i ran into that fun house
and grabbed that kid ,
everyone would look at me
like the hero i always wanted to be .
correction . what &apos;s most embarrassing
is everything i &apos;ve done since then
to try to make up for the first thing .
what are you talking about ? &quot; hero &quot; ?
you &apos;re so much more than that .
you have flaws .
you fall down a lot .
you frighten yourself .
you cannot even open a jar . you cry all the time .
i &apos;m really ready for this to build into a compliment .
the point is that you are comfortable with yourself ,
and you make people around you feel comfortable .
they feel that they can talk to you .
that &apos;s your superpower !
pool &apos;s drained , leaks are fixed , generator &apos;s running ,
and i &apos;m meeting my buddies .
why , jay ? why you have to go out ?
it &apos;s a hurricane outside !
i just do .
i think you probably loosened it with the ...
don &apos;t .
here &apos;s your precious uniform !
that &apos;s beth &apos;s .
oh , so you admit you &apos;re still in love with her !
what ?
just saying &quot; hey &quot; hurts , doesn &apos;t it ?
haley !
haley !
stop ! what are you doing ?
you won &apos;t kiss me . you won &apos;t even touch me .
and then i find beth &apos;s uniform ?
so you tell me , okay ?
what do you do with it anyway ?
you -- you -- you sniff it , you snuggle it ,
you put it on a coat rack and dance with it ? !
i &apos;m sending beth &apos;s things back to her ,
and i got her uniform pressed because i love my country .
so , y @-@ you and beth , you ...
there is no beth . there &apos;s only you .
i &apos;m just trying to slow us down a little .
we kind of started this whole thing off in the middle .
i just want us to catch up emotionally
to where we are physically so we don &apos;t burn out .
we &apos;re not going to burn out .
i liked you way before we ever hooked up .
i just want our relationship to be as good as our affair .
i mean , we never even had a romantic first date .
i know .
maybe we should wait for the perfect moment
so we can start our relationship right .
something special and magical , like in the movies .
what do you want me to do ,
chase you through an airport ?
i think we got it .
oh , yeah .
come on !
a damn tree &apos;s blocking the street .
i need my chainsaw .
jay , i know you didn &apos;t ask my advice ...
i &apos;m glad you noticed that . i &apos;ve been stuck here all day .
now , i &apos;m going to that bar !
the last thing i need &apos;s another delay .
where the hell &apos;s the chainsaw ? !
it &apos;s right there .
i &apos;m not gonna get there , am i ?
we don &apos;t have to talk about it .
old navy buddy of mine , big jake , died today .
guys in my unit have a tradition
whereas , when one of us goes , the rest of us ,
no matter where we are , find the nearest irish pub ,
at 7 o &apos;clock , silently toast the fallen .
started with 10 guys .
four of us left .
probably should have told gloria about it ,
but i don &apos;t know .
we all went through some rough stuff together ...
hard to talk about .
thanks .
phil .
why can &apos;t we remember this last piece ?
we just had it this morning .
hey , guys . i know you &apos;re busy ,
but do you think being hit by lightning
can make people smarter ?
get out of here .
yeah . it &apos;s probably just a myth .
there &apos;s so much crazy stuff written on the internet these days .
turns out , when they figured it out the first time ,
the formula was in the background of a selfie i took .
anyway , if you don &apos;t think lightning can do that ,
it must not be true .
after all , you are the smartest people i know .
