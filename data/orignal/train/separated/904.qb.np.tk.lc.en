back in the &apos; 80s ,
my mom was obsessed with thanksgiving .
when it came to her cooking , ererything had to be perfect .
she even made practice turkeys fore the big day .
i need feedback .
that &apos;s good !
but not great .
what ?
i &apos;m going again .
to my mom , it was a time for family .
for my dad , it was a hassle .
why do we got to schlep all the way here to go shopping
when we got a perfectly good market
a minute away from our house ?
well , i thought this time of year ,
a change of scenery would --
oh , look ! murray , there &apos;s your father !
what are the odds we &apos;d run into him
in a totally random grocery store ?
you got a bag boy to tip you off , didn &apos;t you ?
so , i have eyes everywhere .
what ? does that make me some kind of villain ?
bevy , every year you ask me to invite
that spiteful , miserable man to thanksgiving .
you got to give it up .
you &apos;re right .
he &apos;s your father , and i have no right to --
hi ! ben , look ! it &apos;s your son -- murray !
you remember murray .
hi , dad . how you doing ?
my foot &apos;s still got that thing . and i need eye surgery .
yeah , good stuff .
so , any plans for the holiday , ben ?
yeah , i got it right here .
this compartment is the stuffing .
that &apos;s the sweet potatoes .
that gray circle -- that &apos;s the turkey .
come on , wouldn &apos;t a home @-@ cooked meal
be much better than that ?
that depends . you know what
happened the last time i ate your cooking .
that was right after we got married .
that was ages ago .
your turkey was drier than the sun .
it was like eating the inside of a vacuum bag filled with pencil shavings .
i did not enjoy the meal .
you ? no .
it was the first time i &apos;d ever cooked thanksgiving by myself .
my kids were little . they were hanging all over me .
i didn &apos;t even have a baster . i was baster @-@ less !
no baster could fix your food crimes .
sorry , pal . you deserve better .
nice seeing you , dad .
eh , it was okay .
this is not over .
you invite that callous , hurtful man to thanksgiving right now !
see , i see why you &apos;re hocking me all the time to invite him .
you just want to show my dad that you &apos;re a good cook .
the best cook .
and family is important and ... stuff .
well , it &apos;s not gonna happen .
it &apos;s bad enough you invite my moron brother every year .
oh , stop . marvin &apos;s not that bad .
gobble , gobble ! hide your turkeys , ladies !
you little muskrat !
looking good , uncle marvin .
i &apos;m feeling good . i lost 10 pounds .
i gained 6 , lost 4 , gained 2 .
also , your voice is weird .
it is . i @-@ i &apos;m hoping this isn &apos;t where it lands .
that &apos;s the spirit .
mur @-@ man !
what &apos;s with the , uh , pajamas ?
you mean these certified medical scrubs ?
as you know , i &apos;m almost a fully licensed chiropractor .
ah . good . another one of your half @-@ baked schemes .
schemes ? what schemes ?
first , you were breeding alpacas .
then you were selling alpaca wool .
then came alpaca burgers .
what the hell was i supposed to do with a dozen dead alpacas ? !
regardless ...
those were all obvious steps to chiropractology .
i don &apos;t know if that &apos;s the official title .
they reveal that to us at graduation .
that &apos;s something to look forward to .
see that ? negativity .
i could take away all of your stress
just with a single -- &quot; tktk ! &quot; -- crack of your cervical spine .
no .
come on . come on ! come on !
aah ! no !
i &apos;m serious . stay away from me .
hey , come over here . come on .
no , no , no , no .
don &apos;t struggle . come on .
no . no !
i don &apos;t want to break anything .
get off me .
this feels dangerous and unsafe !
it is if you fight it !
oh , i hate thanksgiving ! i hate it so much !
i &apos;m a healer ! let me heal you !
make it stop !
it was november 20th , 1980 @-@ something ,
and pops was ready to pass down a thanksgiving tradition .
erica , guess what . i got something for you .
a car ?
no .
did you get me a car ?
no .
did anyone get a car ?
no . what is it with you kids and wanting a car ?
it &apos;s kind of like , we don &apos;t have a car ,
but we want one .
like a car .
look , this is even better .
i want you to take over the thanksgiving toast .
my grandfather passed it down to me , and now i pick you .
you have to keep a lame @-@ ass family tradition alive .
you see , that &apos;s why i &apos;m picking your sister --
&apos;cause she &apos;s the heart and soul of this family ,
who &apos;ll keep this tradition alive .
lies !
i &apos;m the heart , soul ,
and deadly fists of this family , not her !
i want to do it !
you &apos;re right , kiddo .
if you really want to be toastmaster general ,
then you deserve a fair shot .
you &apos;re so dead .
saying words good is my specialness .
to life !
you &apos;re clearly picking me .
i &apos;m picking you .
to life .
dad , i @-@ i know you &apos;re swamped
watching your big football contest .
go , blue team .
i actually like the green team .
fun stuff .
listen , i don &apos;t want to waste your time ,
but i thought you should know
that i might be working on my best video project yet .
w @-@ what &apos;s happening ?
i just need six more hours of therapeutic massage
under my belt before i &apos;m board @-@ certified .
this isn &apos;t a good time .
gotcha .
anyway , now that i &apos;m getting older
and growing as an artist ,
i &apos;m venturing away from robot movies
and fart @-@ based comedy skits to more serious work ,
with real emotional impact .
this still isn &apos;t a good time .
the moment felt right .
it &apos;s not .
roger that .
point is , i need a better wide @-@ angle lens
to fully realize my vision , but they &apos;re quite pricy .
my vision is i won &apos;t have any children asking me for money .
go away !
okay , okay , but this counts as an hour .
i &apos;m gonna go get the paperwork for you to sign .
look , all i want you to do is watch what i have already .
i think you &apos;ll see what i mean .
that year , i discovered the song &quot; cat &apos;s in the cradle . &quot;
like any teenage kid , the catchy chorus
and &quot; my dad is a jerk &quot; lyrics spoke to me .
and the cat &apos;s in the cradle and the silver spoon
little boy blue and the man in the moon
what i didn &apos;t realize --
it spoke to my dad even more .
but we &apos;ll get together then
you know we &apos;ll have a good time then
oh . that song .
always manages to hit you hard , you know ?
i guess . i @-@ it &apos;s only halfway done .
you finish it .
wait . for real ?
yeah . before i change my mind .
turns out &quot; cat &apos;s in the cradle &quot; made my dad feel things ,
and like any good son , i &apos;d use this to manipulate him .
hey , dad , they just released a new dungeons &amp; dragons module .
can you drive me to the hobby shop tonight ?
i understand none of that , but i feel good saying no .
i &apos;m off to work .
okay , but when you coming home , dad ? i don &apos;t know when .
all i did was subliminally remind him of the song .
we &apos;ll get together then .
damn .
let &apos;s just go now .
as i was working over my old man ,
barry was working out new toast .
&quot; f &quot; is for family .
&quot; a &quot; is for how awesome this family is .
&quot; m &quot; is for &quot; mmm , turkey . &quot;
&quot; i &quot; is for my eyes that get to see you all .
&quot; l &quot; is for ll cool j ,
who probably also celebrates thanksgiving .
&quot; y &quot; ?
because he &apos;s american , like us .
family !
i mean , you got charm .
uh , but what you don &apos;t have is a good speech ,
or charm . i just said that to cushion the blow .
damn it . what am i supposed to do ?
erica &apos;s so smart and emotional
and has these female hormones that make her feel stuff .
how do i compete with that ?
well the first thing you got to do
is lie down and let your uncle marvin
crackle your spine bones and your neck tendons
to release toxins .
okay .
okay ?
okay !
okay !
right there ?
yeah . facedown . there you go .
got to get a good stretch on here .
this flank .
that -- that hurts my body .
that means it &apos;s working .
as for your speech ,
there &apos;s one thing that i learned in back @-@ cracking school ,
and that &apos;s how to captivate a client .
go on .
you see , in the manual , it says
that constant talk and distraction helps them ignore
the searing pain that is spinal alignment .
that makes sense .
it &apos;s not just about using your words .
it &apos;s also ... about flash !
flash ! you &apos;re right .
that &apos;s what i need to add to my toast !
exactly .
now , just get up there
and show them what you got , kid .
i &apos;m good .
you look good .
well , what &apos;s going on in here ?
just watching &quot; alf &quot; and playing &quot; cat &apos;s cradle &quot; --
no relation to the song .
you know the song , right , dad ?
that song .
you know what would push this father / son moment over the top ?
you whip us up a malt to share .
that &apos;s a great idea , pal .
what &apos;s going on ?
just some father / son bonding time .
tell me what you &apos;ve done to him ,
or i &apos;ll make you go outside and play catch with your dad
on the lawn in front of the entire neighborhood .
no .
and not with one of those soft nerf balls , either .
not the hard , white ones with the sewing on them .
that &apos;s right -- baseballs .
okay , okay !
truth is , &quot; cat &apos;s in the cradle &quot; makes dad bend to my will
&apos;cause the words make him sad .
how selfish can you be ? !
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;ll stop .
you most certainly will .
after you use your evil to help me .
seriously ?
play the song .
get him to invite pop @-@ pop to thanksgiving
so he can finally see what an amazing cook i am .
isn &apos;t your thing , like , way more selfish than mine ?
oh , yes .
now that man will eat my food and his words .
and also ... family &apos;s important and stuff .
there &apos;s a lesson in there . figure it out .
gobble , gobble .
it was almost dinner time ,
and even though i manipulated dad into inviting pop @-@ pop ,
the old grouch was a no @-@ show .
do we have to wait for pop @-@ pop ? i &apos;m starving .
just give me a scoop .
hey ! don &apos;t ruin the presentation .
half of eating is done with the eyes .
murray , where &apos;s your father ?
he &apos;ll be here any minute .
still waiting on dad , eh ?
that &apos;s weird .
i thought you called him , murray .
okay , you &apos;re really laughing it up ,
which tells me you &apos;ve done something idiotic
and you want me to hear about it .
go ahead .
after you called our father
to invite him to thanksgiving , i called him back ,
and i said that i was going to pick him up ,
but i never did .
you know , even for you , this is incredibly stupid .
uh , it &apos;s brilliant ,
and you have your son adam to thank for it ,
&apos;cause he keeps on playing that &quot; cat &apos;s in the cradle &quot; song .
and , uh , everyone knows
that it &apos;s the greatest revenge song ever written .
how do you get revenge from that song ?
hello ?
it &apos;s about a boy who gets shafted by his dad ,
just like we were .
and then he grows up ,
and his dad calls him to hang out ,
and then the boy is just like
&quot; ha ! i &apos;ve been waiting for this moment .
i have my own life now .
so suck it , old man ! &quot; click !
that &apos;s not what it &apos;s about !
it &apos;s about spending time with your kid .
what you talkin &apos; &apos; bout , murray ?
it &apos;s right there in the lyrics .
the cat eats the baby with the silver spoon
those aren &apos;t the words !
it didn &apos;t eat a baby . no baby got eaten .
the cat eats the baby ...
no baby gets eaten .
... with the silver spoo-- would you wake up ?
a cat cannot use a spoon .
it &apos;s got paws .
a cat can very easily just pick up a spoon like so
and --
hey . whoa ! stop !
wh-- i @-@ it &apos;s dinnertime . where are you going ? !
to get my father .
you &apos;re gonna ruin my ruthless revenge plot against dad !
what kind of thanksgiving is this ? !
what we didn &apos;t know ...
... was thanksgiving was about to get awesome .
why don &apos;t we just hear a toast while we &apos;re waiting ?
erica , show us what you got .
thank you , pops .
well , i &apos;m just gonna speak from the heart and say --
ladies and gentlemen @-@ men @-@ men @-@ men ,
are you prepared for the ultimate
thanksgiving extravaganza of love @-@ love @-@ love @-@ love ?
and with that , barry appeared from the smoke
to take thanksgiving to a new level .
what the heck is this ?
an idiot giving a thanksgiving toast .
y &apos;all &apos;s about to get touched , ninja pilgrim @-@ style .
turkeyyy @-@ yah !
it was educational .
and so that &apos;s when chris colombo married pocahontas
and they feasted upon corn , or maize ,
named after its &quot; a @-@ maize @-@ ing &quot; taste when buttered .
it had music .
it was packed with metaphors and symbolism .
it had pyrotechnics ...
and breaks for hydration .
it had emotional pandering ...
look at us -- love .
he leaps from half @-@ court !
... and a cinematic climax .
3 points for family !
the nuclear weapons are disarmed !
the goldbergs saved the world !
in conclusion , thanksgiving !
and it ... was ... awesome !
wait ! you actually enjoyed that confusing pile of garbage ?
it was a real experience .
i feel like i just went to atlantic city .
i liked the part where you showed the baby pictures .
but it made no sense !
how can a slam dunk disarm nuclear weapons ?
can &apos;t wait to hear what you got in store , erica .
i think we should space them out a bit .
no ! please .
talk from the heart .
uh ... we should wait on pop @-@ pop
because that is the right thing to do .
so i &apos;ll be upstairs .
not writing a speech .
just , uh , waiting for them to show up , so i &apos;ll be g @-@ gone .
as erica retreated , pop @-@ pop was on the warpath .
i can &apos;t believe you people --
making me wait outside nearly seven minutes
in the dead of fall .
it was just a little mix @-@ up , dad .
marvin will apologize .
you want me to apologize to him ,
the man who picked me up from soccer practice at midnight ?
i had a thing .
that &apos;s it !
i &apos;m not stepping one foot in that house as long as he &apos;s here !
good . now i got something to be thankful for .
hey ! what are you doing dropping the pants ?
that &apos;s my thing .
i &apos;m the one that invented dropping your slacks at the door .
it &apos;s thanksgiving . pull up your pants .
how you doing , ben ?
you think you &apos;re better than me ?
speaking of better , try my turkey , ben . taste .
no , no , no . i learned my lesson a long time ago .
here . heat this up . i &apos;m starving .
come on . you can &apos;t have thanksgiving from a box .
just take a taste , ben .
i &apos;m not kidding you .
take a damn taste .
i &apos;ll take a taste ! i &apos;m eating out here !
everyone , just calm down .
adam , uh , why don &apos;t you
just play your &quot; cat &apos;s in the cradle &quot; video ?
oh , hey ! son of a bitch . i love that song .
that &apos;s got that nice message in it .
that right ?
yeah , there &apos;s this needy brat
who &apos;s been pestering his dad for years .
his dad just wants to be left alone .
all right , so , now , years later , they &apos;re on the phone ,
but his son now -- oh , he &apos;s finally into his own crap .
so his father hangs up the phone
because now he &apos;s got what he &apos;s always wanted --
to be left the hell alone .
it &apos;s a revenge song !
the son wins in the end !
no one wins !
it &apos;s about the struggle to not let time slip away .
no one thinks that !
adam . do your jedi mind trick .
play the video and make people listen to you .
that &apos;s why you &apos;ve been playing that damn song all the time ? !
oh , balls .
you were screwing with my mind ? !
mom was the one that tricked you into inviting pop @-@ pop
so she could force @-@ feed him turkey .
what ? !
what ? !
what ? ! i can &apos;t hear !
i &apos;m outside here ! speak louder !
who &apos;s ready for a high @-@ octane ,
tear @-@ jerkin &apos; thanksgiving toast ?
oh , boy . this is real bad timing .
watch out , russia .
it &apos;s the american baseball team ,
and they &apos;re hitting home runs for family .
oh ! my decorative gourds !
dude ! you &apos;re stealing my whole speech !
no , it &apos;s different !
you did basketball . i &apos;m doing baseball .
what ? !
doesn &apos;t matter . i win .
i forgot what it was for , but i beat you .
you don &apos;t even know what this is about ? !
i dislike you so much !
stop it ! stop it !
everybody stop it !
stop it ! it &apos;s thanks--giving !
i don &apos;t care what it is !
i want these crazy people out of my house !
no ! i &apos;m so close !
ben , try my yams .
i learned my lesson . no .
no yams ! i &apos;m taking out the leaf !
no ! not the leaf !
what &apos;s happening ? !
i feel so left out !
my back .
it was a thanksgiving stalemate .
dad wanted everyone out ,
and marvin was refusing to come in .
what are you still doing here ?
thanksgiving &apos;s over . go home .
no . we can still save this thing .
barry , help me set the table around your father .
i can &apos;t move !
i sold 80 @-@ pound vacuums door to door with a shattered pelvis .
suck it up !
marvin , get inside .
murray threw his back out , and we need your magic hands .
yes , i can see how you might think ,
based on my consistent claim that i &apos;m a chiropractor ,
how i might be of some service in this particular situation .
you can &apos;t help ?
what kind of a male nurse are you ?
i am a chiropractor , damn it .
at least , i will be once the school is recognized by the state .
there &apos;s no way that man &apos;s touching me !
okay , that &apos;s enough . i have something to say .
again , it &apos;s very bad timing .
look , maybe we &apos;re a garbage family ,
and maybe we don &apos;t always get along .
but , you know , maybe that &apos;s okay .
maybe that &apos;s a good thing .
i mean , barry &apos;s one of the biggest idiots of all time ,
but he gave the best toast this family &apos;s ever seen .
yes !
ignoring the first part .
and if this utter dope can pull that off ,
well , then i &apos;m sure my dopey uncle
has learned enough at back school
that he can fix my dad .
no ! do not get inspired by her speech !
&apos;cause the fact is it &apos;s thanksgiving !
and if a family can &apos;t believe in each other
on a day like today ...
well , then , when can we ?
sure , it was insulting , but also deeply moving .
that night , erica proved
that she could toast with the best of them .
what is happening ?
your faith in me is all the training i need .
no !
you can do it , marvy .
no !
it &apos;s all you , uncle marv .
no !
give it a shot , marv !
i &apos;m a little drunk .
i &apos;m going in !
don &apos;t go in !
what are you doing ? !
flash !
how you feel ?
i actually feel better .
look -- he &apos;s standing straighter !
i told you i &apos;m a god !
marvin saved thanksgiving !
marvin . marvin !
even though marvin took all the credit ,
my mom still got the moment she always dreamed of .
damn it , marvin ! you &apos;re -- you &apos;re hogging the yams !
look at my old man loving your food .
guess you finally got what you wanted .
raised a moron .
yeah . it &apos;s great .
but look at them all there .
family and stuff .
yeah . family and stuff .
it turned out to be our best thanksgiving ever .
and even though barry and erica battled over the best speech ,
in the end , pops reclaimed the crown .
i &apos;d like to make a little toast .
normally , this holiday makes me think of the love of my life --
my wife , irene .
but as i look around this table tonight ,
i realize we shouldn &apos;t dwell on the loves we &apos;ve lost .
&apos;cause there &apos;s more than enough love right here .
cheers .
hear , hear .
thinks he &apos;s better than us , that bastard .
if anyone would like a spinal adjustment ,
meet me on the couch when this is over .
i don &apos;t get it .
how on earth can you think
this song &apos;s about being a lousy father ?
just a theory .
well ...
i watch you with your kids .
you &apos;re , um ...
not like me .
you &apos;re a good father to them .
even to the weird one .
i don &apos;t know which one that is , but thank you .
hey . the -- the video over ?
i @-@ i got nervous , so i left .
yeah . i @-@ it , uh , played well .
noticed my name on the end there .
since when am i your producer ?
since you paid for the lens .
i couldn &apos;t have done it without you .
any of it .
so ...
yeah .
yeah .
you okay ?
yeah . i &apos;m good .
and the cat &apos;s in the cradle and the silver spoon
little boy blue and the man in the moon
when you comin &apos; home , son ? i don &apos;t know when
but we &apos;ll get together then , dad
the guys from water polo team
invited me on a ski trip .
no .
would you just hear me out before you say no ?
i already said no .
well , i wrote a little song
about father / daughter relationships
that just may make you realize
that our time together is fleeting .
a butterfly emerges from a cocoon
a dad and daughter gaze at the moon
fathers and daughters and fathers of daughters
and the man in the moon is neglecting his daughter --
that song made me realize how precious our time is .
so i can go on the ski trip ?
no . i want you by my side all weekend .
this really backfired on me , huh ?
