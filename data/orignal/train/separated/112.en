第六季 第十一集
400, 500, 600,
700, 800, 900, 1,000.
That's $5,000.
The bank bag. Where's the bank bag?
Sign here.
Are you the one going to prison?
No.
Then what the hell you doing?
Good.
Pay for the hotel room, room service
and my dry cleaning.
Six hours of consultation,
which starts now.
You can go.
I was staying.
No, you weren't staying.
No women.
I'll call you.
Yeah, he'll call you.
Like his first day of school.
Dad, Dad!
Calm down. We're on our way.
So, four years?
Yeah.
Two with good behavior.
You go for three weeks to Statesville first.
It's a maximum security prison.
That's where D.O.C. will classify you
either as minimum, medium or maximum.
Well, I'll end up in minimum, right?
Maybe. There's overcrowding these days.
So some minimum inmates end up in maximum.
You need to prepare for maximum.
You've done time?
A week in County.
A week where-where guys are waiting
for their mommies to bail them out?
Prison is different.
Half the inmates are never going home.
Now, tell me, Mr. Agos.
Do you think guys like that are gonna hesitate to beat
the crap out of you for looking at them the wrong way?
Look, you don't need to scare me straight. I get it.
I just need tips on what to do.
Sure. You want a tip?
I got one.
Here, put it on.
'Cause if you don't start paying attention,
your cellies are gonna make you their prom queen.
Okay.
No. Not okay.
Shut and listen.
What are you gonna do to protect yourself, Mr. Agos?
Any family or friends doing time?
No.
No one who can vouch for you on the inside?
No.
That's your tip.
Okay? Find a friend.
A white guy.
There's no such thing as a post-racial lockup.
Someone jumps off on your block, you got to run with your own.
Because if something happens to you,
white defends white
and black defends black.
Got it?
I got it.
Good. Now, let's find you a white friend.
Yeah?
Kalinda, I need your help.
I'm on my way to you.
No.
The prison consultant is advising me to find a convict inside.
Someone I can trust.
In Statesville?
Yeah.
And one other thing. He's suggesting it be someone Caucasian.
Right. I get it.
Anyone in mind?
I'll call you back, okay?
Is that your girlfriend?
Yeah.
But it's complicated.
You're gonna want to uncomplicate that today.
I'm serious.
This isn't about me.
This is about Cary.
A lot of things about Cary
end up being about you, Kalinda.
I know, but, uh,
he needs help in Statesville.
For the first three weeks, someone to watch his back.
Kalinda, last time we stood right here,
you threatened me.
Eh, my mistake.
Even worse than threatening me,
you threatened my son.
I'm sorry, sir.
But that had nothing to do with Cary.
You know, he has never wavered once in his support for you, sir.
All he asks is that you help him find someone on the inside.
That's all.
Someone, uh... white.
You're gonna get a call in a few hours.
Or a few days.
I need you to take it.
From?
Someone.
You're asking for a favor, Kalinda.
I'm asking for one in return.
You want Cary to have a friend?
Say yes.
Yeah.
Hello?
Yeah, this is Ray.
Who's the guy coming in?
Cary Agos.
Oh, yeah. He's the lawyer caught with Trey Wagner.
Yes.
With the export train?
Yes, that's right.
When's his self-surrender date?
Uh, his sentencing is at 5:00 today...
Sorry, what-what did you just say?
That'll get him here by 8:00 a.m. The next day.
I can meet his transport.
Yeah, no, you said something about Trey's export train.
The $1.3 million in heroin.
You mean "Import," Right?
No, Trey and his buddies were trying to get into their own business.
Selling to someone in Toronto.
Cary was accused of conspiring with Bishop's crew
to get the drugs into the city.
But he couldn't have.
Why? What do you mean?
Because the drugs were already here.
Who said that?
Someone who was arrested with Trey Wagner.
He said the drugs were being readied for export,
but Cary was charged with giving advice on
how to import drugs, not export them.
Yes, to be guilty of conspiracy,
Cary's advice had to have been followed.
And it wasn't. He's innocent.
Look, is this enough to get him off?
I don't think so.
But we could get his plea withdrawn.
Where are you, Kalinda?
I'm coming to you.
No, uh, go to the courthouse.
I will petition for time with Judge Cuesta.
And I'll meet you there.
Okay. I'll meet you there, too.
No, Alicia, Judge Cuesta doesn't like you.
You stay where you are.
No, what are you talking about? Meet who where?
Look, I can't not be involved.
I know, and I'll call you. Just sit tight.
Alicia, you have a debate tomorrow.
If you don't prep for it, you will lose it.
It's that simple.
Okay, I, uh, I got three journalists and one moderator.
And I acted really mad about the standing, so we got it.
We got standing!
Yeah, they think Alicia wants to sit.
I just need to call Cary.
No, you don't. You need to debate.
Oh, Adrian. How are you?
I'm good, Mr. Gold.
It's unfortunate we're inside today.
It's so beautiful outside.
Yeah. Alicia,
this is Dr. Adrien Fluke,
Professor of Renaissance Literature at the University of Chicago.
He'll be playing Frank Prady today.
Yes, in Middle English.
"His heed was balled, that shoon as any glas,
and eek his face..."
No. But thanks.
Johnny?
We need to have a word with Alicia.
Would you give us a second, Adrien?
Sure.
You are down by two points.
That's within the margin of error.
Yes, but you've settled there.
We've let the Prady team think
that you're going into this sedate and soft.
That's why during the debate negotiations we asked
that you be seated.
It's a less aggressive stance.
And we've also leaked some campaign memos
arguing that voters don't want
to see a woman be aggressive.
All to catch them with their pants down.
But this only works if you use the debate
to take the fight to them.
I just need a second.
Take her phone.
What?
Take her cell phone.
Hide it.
Dad, I'm the body woman.
I'm not gonna take her...
You work for this campaign.
When she hangs up, take her cell phone!
Some inmate rolls up on you...
Stand up.
Okay, keep your distance.
Okay? Don't square up.
That's aggression. You're gonna provoke.
So, bring it down a notch?
Yes!
Deescalate.
And the best way to do that is to get him to say yes.
You ever spend time around a toddler?
Like, "No, no, no, no!"
It's the same thing with these cons.
Some gangster wants something that belongs to you,
get him saying yes,
and watch the resistance just fall away.
Okay, first question.
Let's start with the personal-- Alicia?
Your law partner recently
pleaded guilty to a drug charge.
Mr. Prady,
do you have a question for Alicia about this?
I do.
What you need for State's Attorney is
someone who upholds the moral authority of their office.
Someone who does not have a compromised law partner.
And someone who fights
for the law-abiding citizen.
Now, do you really think that you're that person?
Mrs. Florrick?
Yes?
Do you have a response
for Mr. Prady's question?
Oh, I thought he was still busy making a statement.
No snark. Come on!
Well, here's the thing.
Um, Cary's innocent.
My law partner, he didn't do it.
Mm-hmm. Why'd he plead guilty?
Mr. Moderator, can he just interrupt like that?
That's a Romney move. Don't referee.
You've got to get her in the game.
I'm her body woman,
not her fluffer.
When did you become so crass?
No, but it is a pertinent question--
if he's innocent, why did he plead guilty?
I didn't think I was debating two people today.
But, um...
well, it's important to remember that sometimes
innocent people plead guilty.
They...
Alicia?
We're taking five...
Diane?
How's it going?
We're meeting with Cuesta in a minute.
Kalinda got an affidavit from Toronto.
That's great news.
We may need Peter's help
if this doesn't work.
I know, I'm ready to call him.
All right, wait.
Uh, that's somebody on my other line now.
I'll call you back.
Hello?
Hello, Diane, this is Eli.
Eli, I don't have time right now.
Oh, yes, you do.
I need you to stop taking Alicia's calls.
We're trying to prepare her for the debate of her life
and all she's thinking about is Cary.
Well, then tell her to stop calling me.
Diane, listen to me.
Alicia can make a difference for Cary
and any other Cary that comes along, but only if she wins.
All right, I'll see what I can do, I got to go.
Isn't this case over, counselor?
I'm afraid not, Your Honor.
My client would like to file a motion to withdraw his plea.
Oh, come on.
We have new evidence that shows the prosecution charged my client
with a crime they knew he did not commit.
Your Honor, this is not gym class.
There are no do-overs.
What evidence?
An affidavit from Canadian authorities that show
that the drugs at issue in this case were part
of a Toronto-based drug operation.
Okay, am I supposed to be impressed?
The Toronto detectives noted that the shipment arrived
in Chicago on May 11, two full weeks
before my client allegedly gave his damning advice.
Your Honor, the prosecution has charged my client
with conspiring to import $1.3 million worth
of heroin into the country.
That charge is inconsistent with what in fact occurred.
But your client pled to those facts.
Yes, because he was being framed.
Framed by who?
ait a minute, wait a minute.
Counselor, where is the evidence
that the prosecution knew about this?
Because the only way I'm rescinding the plea
is if you can show that the prosecution withheld exculpatory evidence.
But, Your Honor, my client pled...
I don't care what he pled to.
I only care if he pled
because the prosecution lied.
Now, do you have proof that the prosecution knew
that the drugs arrived on May 11?
No.
Well, then there's nothing I can do.
We only ask for our day in court.
And you can have it.
If you can show proof of a Brady violation
and bring it to me before the sentencing hearing at 5:00 P.M.
That's not much time.
Six hours. We've had worse.
We have been given a task.
Probably the most important task we will face
this year or any year.
Two days ago, Cary Agos accepted
a plea bargain on drug charges,
and will spend four years in prison unless...
unless we can find a Brady violation
in the state's attorney's work.
We have six... five hours and 36 minutes
before Cary is taken into custody.
Kalinda.
Okay, so the drugs at issue
in this case were imported two weeks
before Cary allegedly committed conspiracy.
And the Canadian authorities knew this.
That's the exculpatory evidence you think they buried?
Yes, but any buried evidence will do.
All right, so we'll break up into groups.
Carey Zepps, your team will focus on discovery.
Evidence boxes are here.
Check to see if the SA's office had any involvement
with border agents, Homeland Security, anything.
And, Brian, you do the same
with the Chicago PD.
Uh, Someone should also contact Mexican authorities.
See if they knew anything about the shipment.
Kalinda?
Uh, no, I'm gonna stay with the Canadian side.
I have friends up there.
Uh, okay.
Let's regroup in two hours for a progress report.
Remember, Cary is counting on us.
Kalinda.
Cary called me.
Should we tell him?
He'll want to know what we have.
I know.
But we have nothing.
And Cary's preparing to go to prison tomorrow.
We should let him prepare.
I think you're right, okay.
This time it's Alicia. Wait.
Hi, Alicia.
Cuesta needs a Brady violation,
or he won't vacate the plea.
We have until 5:00.
Uh, no, Alicia, listen to me.
Uh, no.
Diane, I can leave right now.
No, we have everybody on this,
we don't need you.
And, Alicia, I need you to stop calling me.
What?
Uh, yeah, I don't mean to be rude, but we need to focus here.
Um, I'll call you at 5:00 after the sentencing. Good-bye.
Good, can we continue?
I'll hold that for you.
Do you want some milk?
No. What?
I-I don't like milk.
Why not? It's good for you.
Let's go, let's do it.
So, what's this about, Ma'am?
You're with the Ontario Division,
is that right, Inspector?
It is-- "O" Division, narcotics.
And you were tracking the shipment of heroin coming in from Chicago?
Yes, ma'am, we were following a gang out of Rexdale.
And you believed their heroin
was being transported through Chicago?
Yes, but when I reached out to Detective Prima...
Uh, wait a minute.
Excuse me, Inspector, but did you say you contacted...
Detective Prima?
Yes, I... I e-mailed him
an official request for information. Why?
Do you still have that e-mail, Inspector?
Yes. Certainly.
Can you send it to me?
Yes, if I knew what this was about.
The Chicago police believe that $1.3 million in heroin
was being imported into the States,
but you wrote to them that it was being exported
into Ontario, correct?
Yes.
And what did Detective Prima say? Excuse me.
Well, I don't mind saying I-I, uh, was a little disappointed
he didn't have the courtesy to, uh, respond.
Diane... we need to subpoena Prima now.
You found the Brady violation?
Yeah.
Anyone you trust out here?
Uh... yeah.
Who? Family?
No.
Sounds like my life.
Girlfriend? Friend? Wife?
A friend and a girlfriend.
Who's the friend?
Alicia.
The girl that was here, right?
Right.
Give her your power of attorney.
Everything you need done, everything you need sent.
Do not trust the girlfriend.
Things change when you go inside.
Go ahead, call her.
Call Alicia.
One of the reasons I'm running,
if not the prime reason,
is that I saw how a marauding state's attorney
ruins people's lives.
Not just the life of my partner,
but the lives of widows and orphans, whose loved ones
have been murdered in the recent gun violence.
Do you have a response to that, Mr. Prady?
My... response to... - Uh, to what Alicia just said
about the State's Attorney's office.
What the hell?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, that was totally inappropriate
on-on my part.
She just looked so serious staring at me.
Uh... what do I think of the,
uh, State's Attorney's office?
I...
I just...
Okay, well, this was a... great idea.
Mr. Fluke, what are you doing?
Dr. Fluke.
Thank you very much, okay? And nothing.
I'm not doing anything. I'm fine.
He's high.
High? No, I'm not high.
I... I'm pleasant.
Okay, we need a new sparring partner.
Come on, guys, this is medical marijuana
for my glaucoma, okay?
I'm functioning here, I really am.
You need to get laid.
You got to start creating memories now.
What's your girlfriend's name?
Kalinda.
Give me your phone.
You're going two to four years without a moment f affection or comfort,
oso give me the phone.
Maybe that's her.
Hi, Alicia.
No. Why?
What?
Where are we on overturning the plea?
I can't ahold of Diane.
What do you mean?
Your plea. The Brady violation.
It, um... okay, uh, l...
let me call you back.
Your Honor, we would like to subpoena the backup drives
of the CPD's Fourth District.
This is completely unnecessary, Your Honor--
Detective Prima stated on the record
he never received an e-mail from Toronto.
Then he shouldn't mind us taking a look at the backup.
You know you only have four hours left, Counselor?
I do, Your Honor. It's very dramatic.
Objection!
The defense is trying
to manipulate your affection for the dramatic,
Your Honor.
I know she is,
Madam ASA.
And yet, I do love the dramatic.
Subpoena approved. And if I were you,
Ms. Lockhart, I would race out of this court right now.
Thank you, Your Honor.
Oh, we're in.
That's CPD's server.
Okay, good. Now, can you access
the individual e-mail archives?
I can access anything, Kalinda.
Good, 'cause I need positive proof
that he received this e-mail.
Nope, he did not.
What?
He didn't receive that e-mail.
You know that already?
I do. There.
Wait. Couldn't it have been deleted?
Ah... that's the question, isn't it?
Howell.
Yeah, time for the metadata.
You delete an E-mail, it's still gonna show up in the metadata.
Metadata don't lie.
Are you the girlfriend?
Uh, who is this?
It's the damn tooth fairy. Are you his girlfriend?
Is this the Bishop call?
It's the prison consultant.
Your boy's throwing up in the bathroom.
If I were you, I'd get your ass down here and do your job.
My job? What's my job?
It's your boyfriend's last four hours of freedom.
You need to screw his brains out.
Look, I'm a little bit busy right now, okay?
He's going away for four years. Four years.
What else do you have to do that's more important than that?
Okay, almost there.
I'm getting him a hooker.
You don't get down here,
I'm getting on the phone with five hookers I know.
'Cause he's a nice kid, and he deserves a memory.
Yeah, look, I'll get back to you, all right?
Okay, here we go. Metadata.
And wear something sexy.
What?
Uh, bad news.
I went to his spam folder, and he has it set up
to automatically delete at the end of every week.
Well, couldn't he have read it first?
Nah. The metadata says he never opened it.
Sorry, K. It's a dead end.
Good. You came to your senses.
Okay, I approve.
All right, I'm gonna leave you two alone for a minute.
Not too long. We got work to do.
Treat me like an adult and tell me everything!
It was a Hail Mary pass,
and you needed to focus on getting ready for prison.
I don't care how far-fetched it is, Kalinda.
If there's even the slightest chance of me beating...
There isn't.
What do you mean?
Alicia said that there was...
We were trying to find a Brady violation.
And there isn't one.
I'm sorry, Cary.
Okay.
Hey, I got to live in hope for an hour.
That's something, I guess.
Less talking, more sex.
So, Eli, is there anything in particular
you want me to focus on?
Just one thing.
Bury her.
Bury her?
Don't let up. Go for the jugular.
Just like you would if it were a real debate.
Okay.
Character. Character is the central issue in this campaign.
The S.A. must be above ethical reproach,
and that is where my opponent falters.
Excuse me, but I...
The company that we keep matters.
Mrs. Florrick has represented the biggest drug dealer in Chicago.
She has represented the wife-killer, Colin Sweeney.
Governor Florrick, we're all acquainted
with Governor Florrick's record.
As a candidate for this office,
Mr. Prady should understand the importance
of judging people on their own merits,
instead of engaging in guilt by association.
The cynicism is beneath him.
Better.
So that was a memory.
Hey. Again?
Sure.
I won't disappear on you.
Four years is a long time.
Two years with good behavior.
I'll be here.
Good.
So... rotated the tires?
How hard would it be
to fake the metadata of Prima's account?
What do you mean, Kalinda?
How hard would it be to make it look
like he read the E-mail from Canada?
You know that's illegal, right?
Yes, but I'm asking hypothetically.
It wouldn't be that hard. But, Kalinda, you hack someone,
you pray there are no cops waiting on the other end.
This is all cops?
Kalinda. Anything?
Not yet.
But I'm working on something.
Let me know as soon as you can.
We've only got two hours.
Okay, look, uh, here's the thing.
You show me, in theory, how one would do it.
Then you leave.
You don't contact me, I don't contact you.
And if this gets more serious...
you tell the truth: I asked you how to hack into an account.
But you had nothing to do with it.
Kalinda.
I love you.
I'll do what you ask.
But you can get in some real trouble with this.
I know.
Show me.
Like this.
Always like this.
It's not because someone's gonna steal your food.
It's because someone might slip
a piece of glass into it.
Now eat.
I'm not hungry.
Three squares a day. Food's lousy,
but you got to keep your strength up.
Look, you got a misconception about all this.
From Oz and Shawshank.
Where you're going, it's not like that.
You're gonna be fine. Your first few months
and your last few months are the hardest.
Anyone ever ask you about taking off?
Yeah.
What do you tell 'em?
Problematic.
Why?
Where do you go?
Two years goes faster than you think.
It's four years.
You ever been to Spain?
They have extradition.
Look, you do what you want,
but you're not built to be an outlaw.
My whole life, I wanted to be one thing.
A lawyer.
And I had it.
I had it. I had it figured out.
Get to the top, take the cases I wanted,
help the people I wanted.
Now...
I can't...
can't figure anything out.
Look at me.
Don't do it.
So it can't be used to investigate you,
your husband, or your partners.
Now, that, that is the height of cynicism.
Let's talk cynicism.
The cynicism of a lifelong Republican
switching parties in advance of his candidacy.
Mr. Governor.
Hi. Sorry. Hi.
I had an hour. I thought I'd take a peek.
You can't stay away.
I'll just sit over here, out of the way.
This is what I would do.
Scroll back up.
That shows the E-mail went directly to the detective's spam folder.
Now, that shows that it was deleted unread.
If one were to do this,
that's what one would change.
Now correct the date,
move it out of spam,
and change it to "Read."
Easy. Now you have to do it here.
Make it match.
Congrats.
He officially read the e-mail the day he got it.
Um, do you have a minute?
Yeah. One sec.
Yeah, I'll talk to you, K.
Thanks.
Um, I think I found something.
I was thinking back over our interview with Prima.
He kept saying "We."
"We never heard the name Inspector Frazier." Who's "We"?
Well, he means the force, the police.
I don't think so.
Check this out. This is a transcript of Prima's interrogation
of Trey Wagner, when they got him to wear the wire.
Now, it's just Prima and Trey, but it's weird.
Read that.
"I'm going to see what I can do to help you, Trey,
but you gotta help me, too."
"I don't know anything."
"Shut up... you lying piece of crap."
You see? It's like good cop/bad cop,
only he's doing both cops.
Someone else was there.
Kevin Rodriguez.
That's Prima's former partner.
All the paperwork right up to Trey's arrest
has both their signatures, Rodriguez and Prima,
until the day of the interrogation.
After that, it's just Prima.
Now, maybe he retired or got relocated or...
Or maybe he wanted off the case.
Very smart.
When I apply myself. Now, my guess is
if they're hiding him,
Rodriguez might have something to say.
We only have an hour.
Diane, look, I think we may have something.
I'll meet you at court, but, if you can, delay Cuesta.
I may need more time.
The problem starts with guns.
The S.A.'s office should aggressively pursue weapons violations...
Except that the office doesn't have the resources to do so.
No, that's not true.
Sorry?
The S.A. Has the resources.
They just choose to allocate them elsewhere.
Thanks for the clarification.
My point
is that this office's apathy
of charging gun crimes sends the wrong message.
I agree. Further scrutiny
of, uh, this office's charging policies is warranted.
Wait a minute. Is that it?
Sorry?
"Further scrutiny."
Now, she just made a good point:
guns are a problem,
but violent crime is a bigger problem,
so choices have to be made.
You know what,
why don't we take a few minutes here.
Thanks, guys.
Okay.
Finn, you-you can't leave.
Eli, I am obviously intruding in there.
No, you're not intruding. Let me talk to him.
It's just that there are... Oh.
Alicia, something, uh... A client thing came up.
I have to get back to work.
Oh, I understand.
Thanks for pitching in.
You're gonna do great.
You were kicking my butt in there.
I think you kicked mine, too.
So we need to find a new Prady.
Hey. We should let Eli mix up the order of the questions.
That way it makes you pivot on the fly.
Sounds good.
Peter, you know I respect
the line, the line between husband and governor.
But I need to cross it and ask you a favor.
Okay.
Cary.
I'm not asking you to consider a pardon-- I'd never go there.
I just want him safe.
You want me to speak to the D.O.C.
and get him put into a minimum security facility.
I don't want him to look over his shoulder
for the next two years.
This won't have any political blowback.
This isn't Bill Clinton helping Marc Rich.
I can't do that,
and you know why.
You're right. Sorry I asked.
You don't think I want to help Cary?
He worked for me, for God's sakes.
Let's just start this thing.
It's Diane.
Have you heard anything from Kalinda?
No, not yet.
Cuesta's running behind, thank God.
Call me the second you hear from her.
The Illinois supreme Court? Me?
Yes, sir.
Things are moving fast-- I have been asked
by the justices to gauge your interest.
Well, yes, of course,
I'm honored, I'm flattered.
Let me walk you through how this will play out.
James Castro is corrupt and he's going down.
Especially if Alicia Florrick becomes the new
state's attorney, so if you conspired with him,
if you obstructed justice...
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, i did nothing wrong.
I wouldn't play ball with Castro,
so they took me off the case.
And what about your partner?
He seemed to have no problem running with it.
He's the senior detective, what the hell am I supposed to do?
All I care is what you do now.
Listen to me.
Castro is a lame duck.
He can't hurt you anymore.
Don't you want to look good in front of the new S.A.?
What happened in that interrogation?
Why'd they take your name off the transcript?
Well, I'll certainly be ready.
I'm just... Wow, I-I
I thought Flaherty or Dominguez
were a shoo-in for the next spot.
Well, sir,
you have fans.
Chief Justice Ryvlan called you an inspired choice.
He thinks you'd bring fresh gusto
to the justices' deliberations.
And when are you meeting with Flaherty and Dominguez?
Well, there's no plan to.
Not yet. You are our man.
Really?
You sound surprised.
Well, you've been Peter Florrick's man for years,
and Peter Florrick wouldn't cross the street to stop me
from choking, so yeah, I guess I am surprised.
Things change.
No, they don't.
And you keep checking your watch, sir.
And the governor just called to see if I'm still
stuck in this meeting instead of presiding in court
on a case involving his wife's firm.
Okay, this was good.
You tell the governor next time he calls:
go to hell.
He was the most corrupt S.A. This county has ever seen.
And now he's the most corrupt governor.
And that's saying something.
Why don't
you just sit down...
No, no. I'd much
rather destroy his wife's firm in court.
Even though I've been successfully stalled
for two hours.
Why are you doing this?
Can you be more specific?
It's the most fundamental
question any candidate has to answer, Mrs. Florrick.
Why are you running for office?
Why do you want to be State's Attorney?
I'm running because I believe there is a failure in leadership
in the State's Attorney's office.
No,
you're setting up a straw man,
Mr. Castro is not in this race.
I'm not just blaming Castro.
Cook County has a history
of prosecutors with serious ethical shortcomings.
There it is.
Well, I think there is a difference
between unethical and controversial.
I know it well. My husband,
unfortunately, was both.
Your husband...
is not in this race, either.
But he is.
What he did as S.A.,
what he's doing now as governor,
informs voters' perception of me.
For better or worse.
Absolutely,
but I think it is critical that people
understand I am not my husband,
and that they can expect more of me in office.
More accountability. More responsibility.
You're never happy. She's kicking his ass.
I don't want a career in politics.
I'm simply a lawyer,
by training and by temperament.
And what that means is I have the character
to put the demands of this job
before my own self-interests
and the discipline to ensure that winning cases
does not become more important than seeing justice done.
Based on your past, Mr. Prady,
I don't think you can say the same.
This is a good time for a break.
What the hell?
You just graduated. That was amazing.
It's finally going good for her, and you go and do that?
They needed a break.
They did not need a break. Your boy needed a break.
You have a problem with me?
Yes,
you were worried about your candidate's ego.
Do you guys want me to leave?
I'm worried about a marriage. You should be, too.
That's complete and utter crap, and you know it.
Think of the long term, Elfman.
Are you doing this for some stupid little S.A.'s race...
No, I'm doing it because I want to win.
I am, too. They win if they're married.
Look at them.
Oh, come on,
Eli, don't try to save your boy at my girl's expense, okay?
I'm not doing that. They're tied together at the waist.
That's exactly what you're doing. She was taking flight
I'm not trying to save one over the other,
that is stupid.
In there, she was starting to kik his ass.
I have worked with them for over five years now.
You know what, you don't know anything.
You know I know them better than you.
You just konw how to protect your meal ticket and that is it.
Why don't you work in the trenches before you say that kind...
Why don't you get the hell off of my campaign?!
This is not your campaign.
This is by far the lowest
trick I've seen in all my years on the bench.
Your Honor?
Don't you dare feign ignorance with me, Ms. Lockhart.
The fact that you conspired to waste this court's time
is not only personally offensive,
it's potentially actionable.
I have no idea what...
It shows poor judgment,
tremendous disrespect, and will deservedly color
every interaction both of you have in this court and
every court in the jurisdiction.
Where's your client? Where the hell is Cary Agos?
I'm here, Your Honor.
Good. Get your ass up here for sentencing.
Your Honor,
we have found the Brady violation,
and we ask...
Oh, yes,
you have your Brady violation
because you delayed me.
Uh, Your Honor,
with respect, I did nothing of the kind.
And we insist that you see this Brady violation.
What did you get?
Kalinda got it. I just pulled it down from her computer.
Your Honor.
I ask leave to approach?
With great caution, counselor.
As you would a lion in a cage.
Good job. They're looking at it now.
Looking at what?
What you found.
Diane pulled it off your computer.
This is metadata from Detective Prima's
account proving that he saw the Canadian e-mail.
That is your Brady violation.
That's a flat-out lie.
We have proof,
Your Honor, that Detective prima buried evidence.
Not once have I buried evidence.
Diane.
Diane.
Let me handle this.
This is ridiculous. How can she just
go and smear my name like that?
Is this Morse code?
What am I looking at here?
It is a metadata report taken from
Detective Prima's computer
proving that he was in receipt of information from the Canadian police.
Geneva, you got to help me out here.
You know this isn't true.
Yes, Geneva, help us out here.
Because from where I sit it looks like the State's Attorney's office
and the Chicago PD are playing fast and loose with the facts.
The state has new evidence to submit.
Uh, Your Honor...
I just received
a statement from Detective Rodriguez.
Mr. Agos may have been a victim of entrapment.
Okay, everybody bring their evidence up here.
Now.
You okay?
Yeah.
Sit down, Ms. Pine. Now.
If your office spent this much
time working within the confines of the law,
the streets would be free of criminals.
We move that we be allowed to retry this, Your Honor.
Excuse me, but we move for an immediate dismissal, Your Honor.
This is not just a matter of a cover-up of the original investigation,
but the police detective who received that e-mail lied to the court.
I did nothing of the kind.
Sit down, sir,
and stop your lying.
I did nothing wrong.
This shows you did something.
Now sit down or I'll hold you in contempt.
Okay, here's how we're doing this.
Mr. Agos.
Please accept my apologies on behalf of this court
for the egregious and overzealous prosecution you've suffered.
I know these words don't make up
for the last six months of your life--
no words ever can--
but they're all I have.
And so I will use them now.
This case is dismissed with prejudice.
Your Honor--
No, leave the poor guy alone.
You're free to go, Mr. Agos.
With our apologies.
Thank you, thank you.
Oh, thank you, Kalinda.
Thank you.
Hello. Yeah, Diane, what happened?
I... Thank you.
Thank you. No, I'm...
Oh, my God, I'm good, I'm good. I...
Okay. No.
I'll-I'll talk to you.
Alicia.
You all right?
