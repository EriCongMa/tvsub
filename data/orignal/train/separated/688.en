the falcon is back on the Graysons' payroll.
Then let's go hunting.
Could it be that you've lied about the pregnancy
you claim to have terminated?
You want proof? I'll give it to you.
I think that we're in this for the same thing--
to get what we can from Conrad
before we take him down.
So you with me?
I bumped into Emily on my way in,
and naturally I inferred that you two had got back together,
which she confirmed.
I hope this isn't too awkward for you.
No. All is fair in love and war, as they say.
Charlotte! What just happened?
You okay?
This is for Padma
and Colleen.
What happened with Trask?
He killed Padma.
Destroying evidence?
I'm not saying a word.
A person's true identity can often be difficult to discern...
Even to themselves,
causing one to question their character...
their calling...
their very existence.
For most, time provides clarity.
But for others...
these questions remain unanswered...
for an identity cannot be fully defined...
when it is a guarded secret.
You know, I've even missed your mysterious exits.
I didn't want to wake you.
I haven't slept this well
since there was a ring on your hand.
History repeating itself,
just like us.
So I made reservations at La Bernadier for lunch.
I got that table you like.
We don't have to hide the fact that we're dating anymore.
Might as well go on a few actual dates.
Ems?
You there?
Sorry. I was... up worrying about Nolan.
The police were questioning him all night.
But they didn't charge him?
That's because he didn't murder anybody.
Well, I've learned the hard way,
that the truth doesn't always set you free.
Listen, they're gonna release him in a few hours.
I really want to be there.
Then let's put lunch on hold.
Give me five. I'll drive you.
No, I-I think I should probably go by myself.
The press is gonna be all over this.
You remember what they were like when you were acquitted.
Like sharks in a blood frenzy.
I'll call you later, okay?
Well, someone out there clearly has you targeted.
I'm just trying to protect you.
Oh, spare me.
The only thing you're protecting is your pompous campaign.
Here are the medical records you so sensitively demanded.
Proof of the termination of my pregnancy.
Though what you're going to do with it,
I can only imagine.
Well, my plan is to stay ahead of the press.
Nightline's reporters are among the most thorough.
If they try and break the scandal this evening,
we are now poised to counter with an appropriate response.
You mean spin.
Victoria, you were a 16-year-old girl,
the victim of horrible abuse by your stepfather.
Your own mother banished you to the streets.
Now detestable as it is, the truth,
in this case, would only work to our advantage
And highlight the campaign's promise of full transparency.
The cavalier way that you exploit my personal pain
is appalling.
If you've been
suffering with your choices all these years, my dear,
I'm only happy I was able to provide you
with a comfortable place in which to agonize in style.
We need to adjust your talking points
for this evening's "Nightline" interview downtown.
You are deranged if you think
that I'm going to sit by your side on live TV
while I expose my personal life to shore up your voting base.
Well, my darling, your presence is mandatory,
So I suggest... that you be on the chopper at 5:00.
And I suggest that you go to hell.
I come bearing gifts.
Black coffee for you,
Skinny nonfat cappuccino for me,
And a not-too-hot hot chocolate for Carl.
I'm sorry. I have no idea what babies drink.
Not that.
Thanks, Ashley.
And that's not all.
What's this?
Conrad's official schedule.
I may have been demoted,
but I still have access to his calendar.
Is there anything here I can use?
The election's a week away.
I still don't have enough leverage
to get conrad to confess to what he did to Amanda.
Allow me to draw your attention
to the three tax board meetings this week.
They're all rubbish.
He and I concluded the tax board sessions last month.
My guess--those meetings are a smoke screen.
What do you think he has planned?
I wouldn't put anything past that man,
but unfortunately, I'm unable to dig any further
without arousing his suspicion.
Don't put yourself at risk.
I can take care of it from here.
Well, do it quickly.
He's gaining confidence, and with good reason.
Recent polling showing
Conrad Grayson within striking distance
of embattled incumbent governor Mark Stoddard,
who seems to be fielding one bad campaign leak after the next.
In other breaking news,
Tech guru Nolan Ross has just been released from custody
after being held for questioning in the murder
of former employee and rumored lover Padma Lahari.
Go.
Thanks, Aiden. I'll see you soon.
20 hours...
They kept me in that place...
shoving pictures of Padma in my face--
The crime scene, her body.
Nolan, I know how you're feeling. I'm sorry.
I want to help you.
How?
By taking down the Falcon.
Listen, if it weren't for him,
they would never have been able to frame my father
or force Padma into delivering that program.
It doesn't matter who killed her, Nolan.
The Falcon is the reason that she's dead.
Look, believe me,
I want to make him pay.
But he's been underground for two decades.
No one knows what he looks like,
let alone how to contact him.
Victoria does.
She gave Conrad documents this morning
that prove she terminated her first pregnancy,
but we both know that's a lie,
which means that she's got someone covering her tracks,
someone tech-savvy enough
to alter hospital records in a matter of hours.
Uh, what hospital?
I tracked down the nun who helped Victoria.
She sent me to St. Michael's, but, of course,
there's no record of her ever giving birth there.
I-I'm sorry.
I can't go head-to-head with the Falcon.
He is... the best there is.
Better than me.
I don't believe that for a second.
Nolan, listen to me, this could be our only chance
to bring the Falcon to his knees.
But I can't do it alone.
Then let's take the bastard down.
第二季 第十八集
We were mortified at the evidence presented at the trial.
David Clarke was our trusted friend,
or so we thought.
Once the prosecution presented the data seized from his computer,
David's betrayal became clear.
Uh, the communiques, the money laundering--
The evidence was black-and-white.
Evidence fabricated by the Falcon.
Look, I know how important taking this guy down is to you,
but are you sure about using Nolan?
I mean, if he makes a mistake,
then you risk jeopardizing your own operation.
Nolan was like a son to my father.
And after what happened with Padma, he needs this.
I found it.
I searched the records at st. Michael's hospital,
and look what I found buried in the code.
So this Falcon--
He just works for the highest bidder?
True hackers are all about the challenge,
proving they're the best.
So his ego is his weakness.
We can use that to draw him out.
How?
If Victoria believes that someone found out about her procedure--
She would go straight to the Falcon,
accuse him of sloppy handiwork,
And that would blow his motherboard.
I think I've got just the thing
to push victoria over the edge.
Oh, Patrick, sweetheart,
be quiet for mommy, please?
Reminds me of Arshile Gorky.
With a dash of Kandinsky.
Art student?
Just spend a lot of time at the New York Artist Academy Library.
I'm the dean of admissions there.
Oh, wow. Small world.
You have a good eye.
And he has a matching pair.
Oh, no. I'm just the baby's au pair.
You know, we have several scholarships available.
伪造
You can imagine how deeply disturbed
I was by that e-mail.
Clearly, someone has managed to expose your forgery,
伪造
Which you led me to believe was next to impossible.
Not next to impossible. Impossible.
Oh, I suggest that you consult an online dictionary
for the meaning of the word.
Don't forget that while you may be able to disguise your voice
with parlor room theatrics, I know your true identity.
What do you want?
The source of the leak.
Uncover it, seal it...
Permanently.
Emily.
What are you doing here?
Well, Nolan said that you've been calling, so...
I wanted to let you know that he's okay,
But he's just gonna lay low.
You didn't have to come all this way to tell me that.
I wanted to check in on my godson as well.
Emily, I don't need you... coming down here all the time,
worrying about us.
Well, I do worry,
and I promised Amanda that I'd look after her family.
While shacking up with the one that ruined hers.
Jack...
I can't do this right now.
I got somewhere I gotta be.
Carl hasn't cried once since his last bottle.
I think I'm starting to get the hang of it.
Ashley.
I thought you hated babies.
Turns out, Carl's the exception.
He's quite the little charmer.
Like I said, Emily,
we're okay.
The only way I'll make it through Harvard is if you're by my side.
大学招生日
Your grades won't matter as much if you crush the S.A.T.,
top it off with a killer essay
and a letter from my father.
No, I-I just don't think I'm a harvard guy, Charlotte.
I was thinking more like N.Y.U. or something.
But they want a killer essay, too,
and I haven't even started the first sentence.
Well, look, I'll come over tonight and help you out with it.
By the time we're through,
there won't be a dry eye in that admissions office.
Thank you.
Good luck, not that you'll need it.
Bye.
You sure know how to hit a bitch.
Looking for round two?
Relax.
It's a compliment.
So you're "overachieving Ivy Leaguer" now?
Last year, weren't you "spoiled, angry party girl"?
Which one's the real Charlotte Grayson?
It's Clarke. What do you want, Gina?
A simple answer.
When you took all those pills last year,
were you really trying to kill yourself?
What the hell kind of question is that?
The kind I wish I could ask my brother.
He did the same thing last summer.
Swallowed, like, half a pharmacy.
I was just wondering what he was feeling before he died.
That really sucks.
You want to get outta here?
Yes. The whole world.
I still can't believe Padma's gone.
It's crazy, but, uh...
sometimes I...
catch myself I.M.ing her, like, at work,
like she's still down the hall.
And then it...
It hits me all over again.
That's not crazy.
The loss never really goes away.
But taking action helps with the pain.
I should've tracked down the Falcon while David was still alive.
Don't do that to yourself.
You are not responsible for this, Nolan.
The Graysons and the Falcon are.
Somebody...
just accessed Victoria's medical records.
Falcon took the bait.
Oh, which means he's about to trigger
that little rewrite I did to his code.
A little too on the nose?
Got him to respond the way we wanted him to.
"D.Y.T."?
"Defend Your Title."
Back in '88,
I set the world record on "Street fighter"
at the mongoblaster tournament.
It was held at, uh, Teddy's Arcade in Brooklyn.
Looks like the Falcon's ready to play.
Tell Nolan to take as much time away as he needs,
and if there's anything else I can do to help,
just let me know, okay?
Thanks, Daniel. And Nolan says thanks, too.
Listen, I was thinking about coming to the studio later
to see your interview.
That is, if you think your father won't mind.
No. No, not at all.
I-I'd love to have you there.
Great. I'll see you then.
I love the Jedi mind trick on Danny boy.
But it'll all be for bubkes if I can't break the Falcon.
You will.
Mr. Grayson, your 2:00.
Mr. Takeda, thank you for the meeting.
It's been a long time.
Yes, it has.
Please take a seat.
Thank you.
I know your time is valuable, so I'll get to the point.
I'm concerned about Aiden Mathis.
He's recently made some unauthorized,
and dare I say, reckless trades.
Well, big risks, big rewards.
Unfortunately, his aggressive style
has upset some long-term clients--
clients that I can't afford to disappoint.
Now I assume you've kept your personnel files of all your employees.
Absolutely. Extensively.
I was wondering if I could look over Mathis',
if you wouldn't mind, of course.
Yes--
Daniel, how--how familiar are you with the Overton...
Mr. Takeda.
This is a surprise.
If, uh, if you two gentlemen are finished,
I'd like to take my old boss out for a drink.
Of course.
Mr. Takeda, thank you for agreeing to the meeting.
Appreciate your help.
Thank you, Mr. Grayson.
This place is awesome.
I had no idea it was here.
Well, the coolest places are the hardest to find.
Same goes for people.
Definitely true in your case.
You sure don't make it easy.
I don't care what people think.
That must be nice.
why do you?
I mean, you're practically a celebrity.
You should be out using the Grayson name to do whatever you want.
But instead, now you hide from it.
I'm not hiding.
I just don't have the luxury of being invisible.
If I mess up, my parents know about it within ten minutes.
Screw them.
Embrace your inner bad girl and come out with me tonight.
I can't.
I promised Declan I'd help him with his college essay.
Or you can tear it up with me
and to hell with the rest of the world.
It's your choice.
Jump in anytime.
I'm waiting for someone.
You win.
A bird of prey, perhaps?
Falcon?
Smart move,
using Grayson to get my attention.
What do you want?
Thanks to you,
I'm currently the prime suspect
in the murder of my girlfriend.
And there are certain details of my life
I'd prefer didn't surface in the investigation.
I need everything on this drive scrubbed from the web.
I'd do it myself, but, uh...
They're watching my every keystroke.
I'll pay you whatever you want.
Don't insult me, Ross.
Did you hack into the state department back in '91 to make money?
Oh, yeah. I know everything about you.
Your real middle name is Leslie.
Your hacker handle was "Lord Zolton."
You used to visit David Clarke in prison, which means
you undoubtedly believe I played a role in his demise.
Look, will you help me or not?
I think I'll pass.
Uh, how about, uh...
We play for it?
I win, you do the job for me.
And when I win?
You won't.
Jack, what's going on?
How you doing?
I'm sending you some pics.
Oh, my God. That's Alison Stoddard.
What the hell is Conrad doing with the governor's wife?
You're out of practice, Ross.
You've been spending too much time in the real world.
What? You should visit it more often.
You of all people should know,
the only existence that matters is online.
You know what?
You are hiding in a world of ones and zeros...
Too afraid to make an emotional connection.
Caring for someone doesn't make you weak.
It makes you stronger,
Which is why...
You... Just...
Got... Schooled.
You win.
Knockout.
Now...
You either
honor our agreement,
or it's game over
for your precious hacker reputation.
Charlotte.
You've been avoiding me.
No, mother. I've just been busy.
Punching classmates in the face?
Would you have approved if I slapped her instead?
Now if you'll excuse me, I'm outta here
before dad drags me into his interview.
Oh, you're safe.
I believe he's on the way to the studio right now.
And I believe you're mistaken.
Ah, and for the piece de resistance,
the true heart and soul of our family home,
my ever-beauteous better half,
Victoria.
Conrad, what is this?
The full-access tour for the "Nightline" audience.
Uh, would you mind if we take a few minutes
before Ms. Chang's arrival?
Looks good. That's great.
Now, now, now,
before you turn me to stone with that look,
you left me with little choice, my dear.
And you have left me with a little bit of a migraine.
I expect you to convey that to Ms. Chang.
Oh, Victoria, look, I--
look, I'm sorry... for the ambush,
but I implore you. Would you do this for me?
My God. You really do want this.
Oh, second only to how much I've always wanted you.
Well, you can only have one of those.
Never fear, Conrad.
I'll assist you in your rise to power.
Your emotions for Emily have endangered her mission.
Daniel's growing suspicious of your past,
a past that should've been erased,
along with your name.
I thought my sister was still alive.
I wanted to keep my name so she could contact me.
More emotions. More mistakes.
No.
Emily needs me.
You're wrong.
This path...
that you've led us down leads nowhere.
You see...
I killed the man who murdered my sister.
It gave me no peace.
So vengeance isn't the answer.
And when Emily's mission is over,
then she'll realize that.
And I'm gonna end this, fast,
and with no more casualties.
And there's nothing that you can say
That would change my mind.
Governor Mark Stoddard...
and his wife Alison have been married for 28 years.
Both native Ithacans.
Alison actually defeated Mark
in the race to become student council president.
I don't think that Conrad and Alison
are having an affair.
Is she even his type?
She's a woman.
Something else is going on.
But what could it be?
I couldn't say,
But after years spent in the revolving door of Grayson manor,
I do know one thing.
Conrad has a tell.
It betrays when he's lying.
He opens his mouth?
No, it's in his eyes.
If I had five minutes with that man,
I swear I could get to the bottom of this,
but unfortunately, I am persona non grata again.
Not if you play your cards right.
Who knew I had it in me?
Oh, besides you, of course.
Although... truth be told,
you throw me a token
and jump me in front of "Street Fighter,"
and... I turn into Bruce friggin' Lee.
Until, uh...
I'm in front of actual flesh-and-bone bad guys,
and I... fall apart.
You got the Falcon to do exactly what we needed.
Yeah, I gotta give her props
for that "Victor Victoria" gag.
No wonder no one could find... shim.
Well, that's about to change.
I've gotta get to the interview.
I will text you an I.P. address
right before they go live.
I'll be ready.
Don't worry.
No one can prove you mothered a kid out there.
Not even the kid.
Are you absolutely certain?
Because there is a news crew setting up in my living room,
ready to go live.
Do you understand me?
You weren't the target. I was.
You just got caught in some high-tech cross fire
between hackers.
I won't be collateral damage in your duel.
I told you, your secret is safe.
I-I got the scholarship?
Two years at L'ecole Des Beaux Arts,
all expenses paid.
Your flight to Paris is next week.
There's only one ticket.
Well, because there's only one scholarship.
but I can't just leave Patrick.
You have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, Vicky.
The kid's parents will find another nanny.
Thank you. No, it'll be great.
I'll talk to her now. All right.
You made it.
Deja vu.
Are you sure you're ready to face the cameras again?
The question is, are you?
The producers are pushing for you to join me.
Now I know it's a little late--
Daniel, how quickly have you forgotten?
Emily values her privacy. Isn't that so?
Actually, I'd love to do whatever I can
for Conrad's campaign.
What's good for one Grayson is good for all of you,
Isn't it?
I'm as grateful as I am humbled.
Then it's settled.
Great.
Daniel, we're ready.
I'll corner Conrad as soon as the interview's over.
And I'll keep my ears open.
So, Daniel,
the last time you sat down with "Nightline,"
you had just endured a grueling murder trial,
Grayson Global was on the verge of financial collapse.
And yet, here we are a year later,
you're C.E.O. Of the family business,
you're reunited with your fiancee,
and "Vanity Fair" went so far as to call you
"this generation's John-John and Carolyn."
I-I don't know about that last part,
But, um, I won't deny
I'm thrilled to be back with Emily.
Well, in keeping with your father's platform
for transparency,
perhaps you'd like to comment
on the flip-flop from last year's interview.
Back then, you vowed full support for your father,
and yet, recently, there have been reports
that you led a coup against him at Grayson Global.
All due respect,
simply the press trying to stir up a story.
No, my father stepped down
to focus on his political career,
and I humbly filled the vacancy.
Fair enough. Now, Emily,
The press is clamoring for details
about your rekindled romance.
And yet, you don't seem to share the Graysons' policy
for transparency.
Well, Daniel and I aren't ones to kiss and tell.
You know, when Daniel suggested that
you join us for this interview,
I asked him if there were wedding bells in the offing,
and he said I should ask you directly.
Well... one thing that I've learned
is that you never can be certain what the future holds.
That being said,
I can't imagine an honor greater
than joining the Grayson family.
Well, from where I'm sitting, it's a perfect fit.
Jack.
What do you want?
Listen, I'm sorry you had to see that.
I owe you an explanation.
You don't owe me anything.
What you saw tonight,
it isn't what you think.
I know what I saw, Emily.
You're gonna be a Grayson.
And frankly, I don't want anyone from that family
around my son.
What are you saying?
I don't want you to be Carl's godmother anymore.
Bye, Emily.
已签完封好并寄出 都是你的了
Yeah?
Okay, slow down.
作为一名纽约大学的毕业生
Oh, it's Declan.
I completely forgot to cancel with him.
Go. I'm right behind you.
All right.
Declan.
Charlotte, hey.
I thought you were gonna help me with this essay.
Are you okay?
I'm fine.
It's just, my parents have this stupid interview,
So they've hidden me away in the tower
to maintain the family image.
Well, then why don't I come to you?
I can bring Carl, and--and he'd love to see you.
I know his uncle would, too.
Um, I don't think that's a good idea.
Look, I promise I'll help you tomorrow.
I really gotta go.
Hold on. I--
Can you check again? We're on the list.
Excuse me, sir?
Can you please check one...
It's under "Grayson."
Hey, Charlotte, over here.
Pose for the camera.
Hey, come on.
How about a smile, ladies?
Feel like putting on a show?
Well, needless to say, a man in my position
will always be subjected to scandal and turmoil.
But the challenges that we have faced as a family
have only fortified our commitment to truth, openness,
and accountability.
Okay, yeah.
That's precisely why we've welcomed you into our home.
Well, I have to say, I'm so happy to hear that,
because my team has just independently confirmed
a tip that we received
about a long-secret pregnancy--
Uh, Juju, I'm gonna-- I'm gonna stop you right there.
Uh, apparently, it was only a matter of time
before my opponent would use
this painful chapter of my wife's past against me.
Victoria faced a tragic choice
in her adolescence.
I know that if she had the opportunity to do it over,
she would obviously have chosen life.
Mr. Grayson, I'm sorry.
Just to be clear,
are you saying your wife had an abortion?
In 1973, yes.
And while we wish we could've kept the matter private,
we're not afraid of the truth.
Wait. Wait. For the record, Mrs. Grayson,
are you now denying that you abandoned
a 6-month-old boy named Patrick
to enroll in a European art school?
The story is true.
"Nightline" will be back after this commercial break.
I really should watch more television.
Oh, I thought you might be calling.
The only evidence of Victoria's son...
existed on my computer, Ross.
How did you do it?
What, you didn't catch that little present
that I left on your jump drive?
The second you plugged it in,
a shadow program automatically booted,
giving me access to your computer,
which I can see you hacking away on
at your not-so-secret cyberspot.
I already know
everything there is to know about you,
and, uh, I'm not the only one.
Check your in-box, Edith.
Yeah.
Nice, clear shot, wouldn't you say?
The FBI certainly thought so.
Keep your hands where I can see 'em.
You messed with the wrong person!
So did you.
The falc0n was a consultant for Grayson Global--
Edith Lee.
Back then, she was just a computer prodigy
brought in to design the company's internal network.
So when the Graysons needed an expert
to fake evidence against my father,
they used someone in-house.
David Clarke's betrayal was the birth of the falc0n.
After that, she erased her identity,
went off the grid.
There was a girl in the retreat photo.
She never showed up in any of my research.
I always just...
assumed she was an employee's daughter.
Another face for you to cross off.
Actually.
This one's all you.
To Padma.
And David.
Listen, I'm gonna call you later, okay?
How are you holding up?
I'm fine.
At this point, nothing my parents do surprises me.
Even the likelihood that you have a brother out there?
Yeah, well, maybe that, but right now
all that concerns me is you.
Are you angry?
Why, because my boyfriend sandbagged me
on live TV?
Boyfriend?
You know, that's the--
that's the first time you've called me that
since we got back together.
Listen, I'm sorry for what I did.
But you didn't leave me much choice.
The only thing keeping us from being together is you.
And if history really is gonna repeat itself,
I can't do this.
I want to spend the rest of my life with you, Emily.
But only if you want the same.
The next time I see you,
if you decided to put that ring back on your finger,
I'll have my answer.
If you're thinking of jumping,
allow me to assist you.
I'm in no mood for your gallows humor.
That's ironic,
considering how you hanged my reputation tonight.
Your reputation?
I don't give a damn about your reputation.
Yeah, or your son you've been covering up.
Or how did she put you abandoned?
Yeah, all those years ago.
Well... it's only a matter of time now
before the media bloodhounds drag him out into the open.
I'll leave you to your demons.
Thanks for watching Carl.
Everything okay?
I was watching the Grayson interview on TV.
Whole family's a train wreck, aren't they?
Except for Charlotte.
So this, um, Emily and Daniel thing--
is that, I don't know, is that weird for you?
I'm done with Emily.
I don't want her around my son anymore.
Dec, from now on, we gotta be careful who we trust.
Who, like Ashley?
Ashley's slick, but...
I'm using her to my advantage.
Good night.
Good night.
Quite a show.
You know, if I were still
your trusted director of communications,
I would've advised against live television.
Yeah, well, hindsight is always 20/20.
Or "Nightline" in this case.
Ms. Davenport, did you really come all this way
to vaunt your ability to gloat?
I also came to help.
You need to be more careful.
I've put too much into this to sit on the sidelines
in the final week of the election
and watch it go down in flames.
Welcome back.
Hello, Nolan.
Victoria.
What a... well...
pleasant surprise.
To what do I owe?
You're a computer genius, and a reformed hacker
if one's to believe your publicist.
Oh, she added "Reformed."
Might I add...
reinstated sole owner of Nolcorp?
Oh. Interesting.
And... in return?
Help me find my firstborn son.
As much as I hate to say it,
Shouldn't you be with Daniel right about now?
I was.
Daniel's pushing me to define our relationship.
What, are you asking me for my permission?
I don't know.
Well, this was your plan all along, wasn't it?
Rip the golden boy away from his family,
tear the Graysons apart from the inside?
Leave them broken, powerless.
Yes.
Well, then tell me this one thing.
When this is all over, when...
when they've paid for what they did to your father,
then what?
I can be with you.
Then marry the son of a bitch.
And take them down once and for all.
