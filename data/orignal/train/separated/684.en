Mr. Grayson here made some kind of deal with the court.
Helping you would be beneficial towards restoring
his public profile.
Daniel's adding a new feather in the company cap.
Stonehaven United.
Nolan Ross is hiding the Carrion program.
We're counting on you.
Helen Crowley made contact with me,
told me that my sister's still alive.
And we need to draw her out.
Who were those guys?
I have my suspicions.
Brava.
Now let's see if she buys it.
Every human is born of collusion.
We come into this world the result of a covenant.
Sometimes made of love...
Sometimes of circumstance...
But almost always made in secret.
I have to assume
that you're reading that rag at that decibel
for my benefit.
What in this house isn't for your benefit, dear?
Though I did catch wind of some news
that I'm sure will interest you.
Jason Prosser is vying for Stonehaven United.
Now that's a lead from the initiative
you were once in sole possession of.
Well, what are you implying, Conrad?
That you're trying to subvert the deal
to prove Daniel's incompetency to Helen.
Don't get me wrong. I approve of the plan.
Just not with your visibility.
I've had my communications director
assemble a Montauk dossier.
As I go forward with my plans to clean up the docks,
I expect you by my side
as the wife you've recommitted to be.
So you're still using Amanda Clarke's hardships
to feed your delusions
of one day occupying the governor's mansion?
Morning, all.
Darling, happy birthday.
Thanks, daddy.
Just don't spend it all in ten places.
Sweetheart. Oh.
Is it possible that I have a 24 and 18-year-old?
Where does time go?
And where is Daniel?
Oh, believe it or not, he's already in the office.
So driven that apparently
he forgot his little sister's big day.
Good morning.
Oh, good morning.
Charlotte, would you excuse us for a minute?
It seems that the cat has dragged itself back in.
There's the report you requested.
Thank you.
So this is the new communications director?
Don't you know that politicians
tend to keep their concubines in the closet?
Spoken like a woman that no one is sleeping with.
You'll be happy to hear that Ms. Davenport and I
have put our past behind us,
and we are now looking to the future.
Well, I can only imagine what kind of horrifying footage
that will yield.
You look like the loneliest man in the world.
First I'm banned from Grayson Global,
now your house.
How long till our scheming
gets me banned from the Hamptons entirely?
That's why I called.
I needed an honest moment.
I miss you.
Me, too.
As most of the time I'm with you,
I'm resigned to playing the jealous ex.
Well, you played it perfectly last night.
Thank you.
How are you doing with it?
As well as a woman leading on her ex-fiance
can possibly feel about herself.
He's taking me to lunch, to a new oyster bar.
Oysters. Subtle.
Hey, well, at least our... mission is on track.
Aiden, I know how hard it must be,
waiting for a lead on your sister,
but until they give you proof that she's alive--
I can subsist on hope,
which is more than I've had for the past decade.
So what's your next move?
Unfortunately, it's not mine. It's Helen's.
She's holding all the cards.
Whatever happens,
we're gonna figure it out, okay?
I promise.
I know what you're up to.
You had the seller stage this place
with all my favorite decor, didn't you?
Anything to end your never-ending house hunt.
You've hated all the other places
for the most nitpicky reasons.
Well, we've only looked at... 12.
At an average of 20,000-square-foot per,
which adds up to--
A marathon.
I see your point,
and I think...
I do love this house.
Great! I'll call the agent.
And this can be yours tomorrow.
Okay. What's wrong now?
Well, the key-- it's a little... pedestrian.
Okay, 'kay, 'kay. Well, nothing's... perfect.
Except... maybe you.
I thought we were going for lunch.
We are.
You love Kumamotos, right?
Well, they're only fresh on the west coast,
and since the oysters can't come to us...
No, I know what you're gonna say--
we gotta take this slow.
But Stonehaven wants face time with everyone in the running,
and I'm at my best with you by my side.
Daniel...
I can't just pick up and leave.
I didn't even bring anything with me.
Don't worry. I packed you a bag.
I even bought you a couple of new outfits for Los Angeles.
It's all on board.
Listen, Em...
You helped me land Takeda Industries and NolCorp.
But this is my first real play as C.E.O.
Help me make it a trifecta.
Please.
Great.
Now I promise, this is a business trip.
All right? We can take it as slow as you like.
Unless...
Easy, tiger. Let's get Stonehaven first.
Then we'll decide how to celebrate.
You could've just called.
That's so impersonal after all we've been through.
And besides, it's in my best interest
to keep the ball in my court.
I have my suspicions you were behind
that little stunt at the wine auction.
Oh, you flatter me.
If you recall, they gassed us both.
A perfect cover for your partner
to run the interrogation.
You and Victoria Grayson have much to gain
by working together--
you to save your sister, she to save her son.
I assure you, I had no part to play in our abduction,
nor would I ever collude with that woman.
I work alone.
And until I see proof of my sister's well-being,
that's how it's going to stay.
What's your name again, darlin'?
Colleen.
That right? You got a family somewhere?
I have a brother.
What do I have to do?
Kill Victoria Grayson.
You have 24 hours.
第二季 第十二集
Not only do I appreciate your plight,
it may surprise you, Mr. Porter,
but we have a considerable amount in common.
We're both entrepreneurs,
both in complicated relationships.
We took over our father's businesses,
and we inherited their sins.
Clearing the drug charge won't be a problem for my lawyers,
but murder...
Jack didn't kill anybody.
We know, but we also know
that the gun used to kill Joe Ryan
was registered to his father.
I thought that's why we were here,
so you could help us with that.
Or is it the other way around?
Are we just the poster children for your new public image?
Oh, you mean do I have a selfish motivation for this?
You bet.
See, my daughter chooses to spend her leisure time
in your questionable establishment,
putting herself in harm's way.
It's a concern I'm sure you share for your son Carl,
a child proudly named after the man
whose legacy you're willing to go to jail to uphold.
The shooter's name is Matt Duncan.
The Ryan brothers put him in the hospital
trying to get him to talk, but he wouldn't break.
I'll get the authorities on the line.
No, look, without Matt Duncan,
my dad would've lost the Stowaway six years ago.
He protected us then. I'm standing by him now.
Oh, I can see we're both stubborn, too.
But unlike you, Mr. Porter, I value self-preservation
and the living.
I'm afraid I'm unable to help you
if you're unwilling to help yourself.
Feel free to show yourselves out.
I knew this was a mistake.
The only mistake being made here is yours.
Father's friend or not, Matt Duncan is a murderer.
If you don't call him out, Carl loses his dad,
and I lose my husband...
Assuming I even get to call you that
before they lock you up.
After the Northridge quake,
my father was inspired to use the profits
from our military contracts
to create a privatized disaster-relief firm.
Stonehaven and its employees meant everything to my father.
And I'm not interested in handing it over to someone
with plans to break it up and sell it for parts.
Believe me, that's not my intention at all.
Forgive me, but your company's rather dubious reputation
doesn't offer much comfort.
Well, I think we can all agree
that Grayson Global needs its own kind of disaster relief.
Why don't you mention what we were talking about earlier?
Right.
My goal is to re-brand our image
so that the "Global" refers to world view,
not world domination.
Thank you for your candor.
And I can tell you
that your bid is on top of a very short list
of competing offers.
Well, thank you very much for this opportunity,
Ms. Carlisle. It's been a pleasure.
Lovely to meet you.
You, too.
You see?
If it weren't for you, I may have lost her just now.
Thanks for the assist.
Well, we haven't won yet.
But it's looking up.
Should we head to the hotel?
Yes.
The pieces of the puzzle
are beginning to come together, Ms. Lahari.
All but yours.
I'm doing everything I can.
Remember what's at stake for you
if you don't find the Carrion program.
Not a moment goes by that I don't.
You're one of many irons I have in the fire.
Don't give me a reason to pull you out.
Looking for...
something?
Damn.
I was trying to hide this so you'd find it later.
I can't do anything about the pedestrian key,
but I can change what you keep it on.
His name is Hanuman.
He's an avatar of shiva
and a deity that wins against demons and bad spirits.
He'll keep you safe in your new home.
You stopped listening at "Avatar," didn't you?
I heard every word you said.
Thank you...
for always looking out for me.
Happy 18th, Charlotte.
From your nephew.
Aw. It's Carl's little handprint.
It's so sweet.
18 is a big one.
You're independent, free.
In my case, I literally was,
since that was the year I was released from juvie.
It was also the year our dad died.
Yeah...
It was.
I wish I had known you then.
I can't imagine what it was like
to lose the only family you had.
Thanks.
Speaking of...
Where's yours?
Daniel forgot.
My father is hopefully getting
the Ryan brothers out of your hair,
and I'm meeting my mom in the city tonight
for the ballet.
It's kind of a tradition.
Speak of the devil.
So what's the program tonight? I pray it's Balanchine.
Well, that's just it, Charlotte.
Everything's okay, but I had to leave town suddenly,
and I won't be back until tomorrow.
But I promise to make it up to you.
Are you serious?
You do know that I love you, don't you?
Yes.
Good. Then keep that close to your heart
till I get back tomorrow.
Okay, thanks.
I'll take care of that, Mr. Prosser.
What does it mean
when your mom cancels your birthday?
I'd say it's her gift to you.
I guess being a Grayson
just means learning to live with disappointment.
You're not a Grayson.
Not really.
Victoria?
I'll get right on it.
Jason.
I am peeved with you.
It seems that you've thrown your hat
into the Stonehaven ring.
Simply my compulsion to leave no stone unturned.
Well, then as a major shareholder of Grayson Global,
let me disabuse you of your pessimistic outlook.
Aren't you still my competition?
Business makes for strange bedfellows.
My son, though well-intentioned,
is not ready for this acquisition.
So I'm here to protect the family business.
There's something you're not telling me.
Only that you would make an excellent steward
for Stonehaven.
And should that come to pass,
I hope you'll allow me to thank you later.
As for now, I have a meeting to get to.
Oh, you're not serious.
I can't believe you. You crossed the country
to lure that rat into helping you.
I just bumped into him.
Oh. I'm here for you, Daniel.
Although I see that you brought reinforcements.
Yeah, it's nice to have someone's unconditional support.
Well, then allow me to offer you mine.
Now if your intention is to rehabilitate grayson global's image,
I would encourage you to not go through with this acquisition.
Why,because I'll affirm my standing as C. E. O.?
No,quite the opposite.
These disaster-relief companies swim in dirty pools,
And Stonehaven is no exception.
They're not humanitarians. They are profiteers.
Are you really trying to take the moral high ground?
Have you forgotten what you are,
what you've profited from?
I suggest you that you do your research
And find out why these people want...
Do my research?
You want me to do my research?
You should probably go upstairs
Before you say something you regret in public.
Think about it.
Yeah.
I assume,per our agreement,you're here to dissuade my son
from going through with this acquisition?
You need to explain to me exactly why
you are so set against it.
Did you not understand a word I said?
This is not in Daniel's best interest.
And unlike my son,Prosser can hold his own.
Now he's sitting on the fence,
and I'm here to push him in the right direction.
There you are.
Aiden, listen,I don't have a lot of time to explain,
But Daniel decided to sweep me off to l. A.
to help him get stonehaven.
And I'm sure he thinks you'll seal the deal
in that blue dress you're wearing.
Behind you.
What the hell are you doing in l. A.?
Funny,I thought the same thing
when I saw you in the lobby with Daniel.
You're saying you didn't follow us?
While I'm not thrilled your lunch date
turned into a change of time zones,
I do trust you,emily.
Then what are you doing here?
Helen found me.
Our little ruse at the auction worked.
She believes victoria's behind everything.
Now she wants proof of her meddling with the initiative's plans.
How can I help?
Go back to new york.
If they believe you're in league with Victoria,
it could have dire consequences.
I can't leave, Aiden.
If Daniel loses stonehaven,
We lose our link to the Initiative.
Well,then our missions are at odds.
Maybe not.
Prosser knows that I'm with Daniel,
So I can't dissuade him, but maybe you can.
To what end?
Making Stonehaven a sure thing for Daniel
forces Victoria to expose her true intent.
And if I'm successful, you'll go?
I'll have no reason to stay.
They release you?
Oh,hey. No,uh... insurance ran out,
So I figure I'd give my girls a chance to take care of the old man.
How you doing,jack?
Not so good.
The ryans framed me with a drug charge.
I was arrested, And the police found a gun on my boat.
And since it's a murder weapon--
I told you to stay away from them.
You--you should've listened.
That's not gonna change the past,matt.
They're gonna pin Joe Ryan's murder on me.
Do you understand that? The one that you're guilty of.
And you want me to confess?
I know this still weighs on your conscience,
or you wouldn't have told me you did it.
You don't know what it's like to have someone hurt your child.
And, yeah, it weighs on me. But I learned to live with it.
Wish I could say the same for my dad.
You heard about what happened,right?
Heart attack at 52.
My kid never got a chance to meet him.
You want him growing up without a father,too?
Another copy of my room key,please.
Okay.
Always the sign of a good visit.
Now you already know this,
but that "Forbes" Cover did you no favors.
Airbrushes are for super models.
Last thing I need Is for people believing I've gone soft.
The man who shorted the subprime collapse? No chance.
So,uh,what brings you to l. A.?
You know who I am. What do you think?
That you're here for Stonehaven.
My boss has a significant interest In grayson global.
He sent me to monitor negotiations.
Right. Satoshi takeda.
I recognize you from the wine auction.
I-I-I did read the "Forbes" Piece
About your passion to
acquire businesses that are good for the soul.
Is--is that for real?
It's my new philosophy,yes.
Well,then there's something you need to know.
A friend at the D. O. J. Informed me
That donna carlisle is looking to dump her father's company
in advance of an indictment,
and the lucky winner inherits the lawsuit.
Why are you telling me this?
Professional respect...
And for my soul.
But look on the bright side.
More time to spend with whoever's getting that key.
Give me a dial on Carlisle. It's Jason Prosser.
I'll have your oldest scotch.
Neat.
You have my father's tastes.
And your father would've been Joe Ryan,correct?
Yeah,his name came up when I was at the Montauk p. D. ,
helping to clear your partner's bogus drug charges.
Hey,does the name Matthew Duncan ring a bell?
In this envelope is mr. Duncan's confession
to your father's murder.
I'm gonna make this... very easy for you.
There's $50,000 for your signature
and a swift departure.
Oh,come on. Haven't you put these boys through enough?
Victoria.
I wanted to find out how the meeting went.
And I see I have my answer.
Were you planning on leaving without saying good-bye?
It seemed consistent with your aversion to open communication.
Some guy in the lobby told me about Stonehaven's pending lawsuit.
Well,then you were lied to.
Over and over,it seems,
starting with the moment you began priming me
for this sour deal in the first place.
I'm no one's rube,Victoria.
No,you're not.
You've always had a strength and clarity of purpose
that I admired from the first day we met.
And I remember the night...
Conrad parading you around that party
at the governor's mansion like he owned you.
But you're no one's possession,are you?
No.
Least of all Conrad's.
The next morning, The David Clarke scandal broke.
That's right.
David made himself vulnerable to the wrong people.
The same people who are about to take hold of my son.
Unless?
Unless you win Stonehaven.
Jason,please. I beg of you.
I don't want Stonehaven. What I want is you.
But you've known that all along.
Do what I ask...
And I'm yours.
I'm so glad Prosser bowed out.
Finally gives us a chance to relax.
Well,we always did make a good team.
And this time I promise to appreciate it.
I don't want to lose you again.
Daniel, please...
No,no,whatever it was, I'm--I'm not that guy anymore.
I'm just happy that you're giving me a chance to prove it to you.
What's in the bag?
Oh,it's a present for Charlotte.
For her birthday?
Oh,my god. I completely forgot.
Well,it can be from both of us.
To teamwork.
Teamwork.
Hey,Donna. Come to a decision yet?
Right.
No,no. Yeah. No. I understand.
Yeah,best to be cautious.
No,we'll see you at 8:00. All right.
Prosser's back in the game.
What?
I'm sure my mother did whatever she could
to keep him wrapped around her talon.
Carlisle wants to hear final pitches side by side tonight,
only I've already said my piece.
About Stonehaven.
But not about your competition.
Hey, big honcho. Or is it head cheese?
Listen,Nolan,I need a favor.
I'm in L. A. and under a time crunch.
You think you could do a little digging for me on Jason Prosser?
Sure. Uh,question is,why would I?
Because you're my employee.
And your friend ms. Thorne suggested you...
Might be able to access the inaccessible.
Did she now?
I'll get right on it.
Thank you.
Please stay on the line.
Your call is very important to us.
You sold our stake in the bar? What the hell were you thinking?
That it's time to put this to bed.
Matt Duncan confessed. That's what we wanted.
That's not what dad wanted,Ken.
He made plans for us,which the porters
and the rest of these bottom-feeders on these docks cut short.
Trying to turn these docks into anything
more than what they already are is a waste of time,
Especially now that they've got Conrad Grayson on their side.
Conrad grayson is a businessman.
And I'm gonna convince him to sell the Stowaway back to us.
I'm gonna make dad proud,okay?
With or without your help.
And simply put,my goal is for Stonehaven
to continue on the same path ideologically.
That is exactly my hope.
Personally,I admire your mission to protect your father's legacy.
My dad was a good man,and not just to his own kids,
to any child, especially disaster victims.
He'd see their faces and how terrified and innocent they were--
I was living in Bushwick during the blackout of '77.
I thought the world was ending.
My father's camera store was looted,
burned to the ground.
Really?
You know,my father helped to rehabilitate that whole borough.
You were probably one of the kids who inspired him.
Well,then I have a personal obligation to repay him.
I'd like to raise my offer if you'll consider it.
Well,as moving as your story about the blackout is,
Ms. Carlisle wishes to uphold her father's mantle,
not destroy it.
Perhaps you'd like to explain to her how you colluded
to inflate gas and oil prices after 9/11?
I was never involved in those transactions.
But your subsidiaries were.
In my short time as C. E. O.
I've learned I'm not only accountable for my own actions,
but for those of everyone working under me.
Why is none of this public record?
Well, because the lawsuits were all settled and buried.
That's a fine allegation coming from a Grayson.
Oh, don't confuse my record with my father's. All right?
Listen, Donna, I never knew your father, but I assume
he'd be greatly disappointed if one of the children he helped
now helps to destroy what he created.
Yes, he would be...
As am I.
I'll have my lawyers draw up the contract,
and we'll go from there.
I'll leave you two to talk details.
Excuse me.
Hello.
Uh, as requested, I hacked Aiden's phone.
I'm sending you the file he just received
from Helen Crowley.
Ems, they've got his sister.
So, uh, where are you from, Colleen?
You ask too many questions.
Our time's almost up.
You're right. Let's, uh, kick things up a notch.
Try it. You'll like it.
Like you said, time's running out.
Why the hell wouldn't Aiden tell me about this?
Well, perhaps it has something to do with the subject line--
"a life for a life"?
We know he's trying to save his sister,but...
who's the target?
Victoria.
Track his phone before it's too late.
Jason.
You and your son make an admirable team.
You set me up,
and he and that woman on his arm knock me down.
What are you talking about? What happened?
Exactly what you knew would happen.
Another Grayson victory.
Jason, my son is in grave danger.
I swear that I have--
Whatever trouble he's in, he deserves it.
And you've earned whatever heartbreak it brings.
What are you...
Aiden!
Damn it!
Why didn't you tell me?
And if I had? I know Victoria belongs to you.
I saw the video. I had Nolan hack into your phone.
Is it really her?
I'm certain of it.
Look, I know what they're promising you,
but you can't let them turn you into their assassin.
If I don't, then I've failed her for the second time.
And if you do, then you give them all the power.
Listen to me, right now Daniel's victory is their main concern,
and they have that. You kill his mother,
you distract him from their main purpose.
Tell Helen that you realized this, and instead,
you helped seal Daniel's victory over Prosser.
Okay?
Look, I'm going back tonight.
You should, too.
We're gonna find your sister.
But on our own terms, not theirs.
And when we do, we are gonna make them pay
for every second they kept you apart.
Do you understand that?
Home again. Home again.
Yeah, we don't have to be, you know?
I mean, we can refuel the jet,
head to the Bahamas, the Azores--
anywhere without business or my mother.
I think I just want my own bed.
But, you know, maybe we can plan another trip sometime soon.
Just got your e-mail. Bidding on the house?
Did you know that there was a secret passage?
Because I am totally hosting a murder-mystery dinner.
That's what finally got you to commit,
a secret passage?
Mm, and, uh...
someone to walk through it with?
I don't know, Nolan.
After everything with Marco--
Hey, my feelings for Groucho Snarx
were fleeting and...
and a mistake.
I mean, he was only after one thing,
and it wasn't me.
Just...
some dusty old computer program.
You mean Carrion?
Right.
Victoria.
How was your flight back?
You know, you and I could stand here all day
trading barbs and nettling each other's last nerves,
or we can cut the crap.
Why did you accompany my son to California?
Because he asked me to.
And I thought I could sway him.
Yes, but in which direction?
I was forced to walk a fine line
between my allegiance to you
and my relationship with Daniel.
Surely you could understand,
seeing as you've just done the same with Prosser.
Well, the difference is
that my son floats through life on crests of women,
unable to make his own decisions.
You could've dissuaded him at any point. Why didn't you?
I guess I wanted to see him win.
You selfish little girl.
In doing so, you may have caused him his greatest loss.
Nolan?
Welcome back.
I read about how the west was won.
讲述美国一家族四代的拓荒历史
I hope I helped the cause with your faux beau.
I think I'm gaining his confidence back.
But I might be losing Victoria's.
It's only a matter of time
before she poisons me to Daniel.
Well, not if you poison her first,
which is a far more fitting end than a bullet,
don't you think? Speaking of which,
Have you heard from Thomas Crown?
Well, I've tried triangulating his phone.
He's either jammed it or dumped it.
I just hope I made the right decision.
I know I didn't.
With the house?
Isn't this the one that I'm buying you?
I don't think so.
It seems nothing
can save me from evil spirits.
11 years ago,
I started working on something.
Have I told you what carrion is?
Rotting meat?
Mm, in the form of a million lines
of binary brilliance that...
have the ability to knock Manhattan off the power grid
in less than a millisecond.
That's what Marco was looking for.
Right program,
wrong C.F.O.
Last week, Padma referred to carrion as a person.
And today she called it a program.
I never told her that.
I'm sorry, Nolan.
Did she get her hands on it?
No.
And even if she had, it's unfinished.
I keep the final sequence locked up in here.
The timing can't be a coincidence.
Padma played an instrumental role
in acquiring NolCorp while seeking out Carrion,
and now Daniel's latest purchase is a disaster recovery firm?
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
That's the initiative's master plan,
turning out the lights?
What concerns me is what happens when they do.
What's your plan for Padma?
I don't know yet.
My advice?
Play her like she's playing you.
Dad?
Mom?
Bon anniversaire, ma belle.
I thought you canceled my birthday.
Never.
We rescheduled it.
We're celebrating you, sweetheart,
Not the gregorian calendar.
Go on. Blow out the candles.
I only have one wish this year.
Anything.
I have spent the last two days
thinking about family
and what it means to be a daughter,
a sister, and now an adult.
And my only wish
is that you support my first adult decision.
I'm changing my name.
I filed papers at the courthouse today.
You can now call me charlotte clarke.
Happy birthday, Charlotte.
From me and Daniel.
Emily.
Well, I didn't realize we'd extended invitations.
Emily doesn't need one.
Let's get you a drink. Love you, sis.
I hope I didn't interrupt your time with your family.
Trust me, I didn't want to be around
for the aftermath of Charlotte's announcement.
I can't imagine what hell
my dad's giving her right now.
Is everything all right?
Oh, I can't do this.
I'm sorry. I need to be honest with you.
A few weeks ago,
Victoria asked me to rekindle our relationship.
She wanted somebody to keep an eye on you
during your transition at work.
I said yes.
So you're the one who leaked Stonehaven to her.
Which is why I fought so hard to help you win it back.
Believe it or not,
I thought I was doing it for the right reasons.
You must think I'm an idiot.
There isn't a single aspect of my life
that my mother hasn't meddled in.
You knew?
I mean, I-I strongly suspected.
Her plans so rarely break in my favor,
I guess I just stuck my head in the sand.
In all fairness, I guess I was using you
as much as you were me.
I was curious to see how far you were willing to go.
Well, now you know.
You think we'll ever get back
to being the people we once were?
Maybe.
Just not tonight.
Hey, can you just tell me what you said to Matt?
Honestly, not much.
He must have had a crisis of conscience.
You did the right thing, Jack.
Daddy saved us.
I'm just glad Conrad stood by his word.
He got the drug charges dropped
and banished the Ryans.
Oh, yeah, because now we're business partners
with Conrad Grayson.
I know. It's not ideal.
Ideal? The guy was stealing money from his daughter
while she was locked up in rehab.
Enough, Declan.
I'm instating a ban on all complaining,
frowning, and negative attitude.
It's not good for any of us.
I didn't sign off on this deal.
Ink's already dry.
You're gonna have to take that up with your brother, Kenneth.
I'll buy it back.
$60,000.
$65,000.
Let me save you this embarrassing display.
Exclusive of your 6-year vendetta
against the wrong man,
I know why you think you want the Stowaway.
I have been approached by investors for decades
with plans to develop the docks,
and each one has resulted in the same conclusion--
The owners have very deep roots,
and they aren't going anywhere.
You live in the castle above the village.
You don't know what I know,
What my father knew, how these people work.
He almost had the waterfront in the palm of his hand.
All we need is the Stowaway, and we can regain
that foothold that he once had.
By what, changing community opinion
with town hall meetings?
Nah. With muscle.
Applying the proper amount of pressure,
I can have roulette wheels spinning by memorial day.
Overly arrogant and ambitious.
I like that.
Think about it.
Think about all those jobs you'll be creating.
It's right in line with your new public image.
Conrad, we should talk about this.
You're right.
We absolutely should talk about this.
Ashley, could you please close the door?
You don't always have to pay for dinner, you know.
Well, chivalry isn't dead.
It's just somewhere in my office.
You said it's your platinum card?
It's probably
next to my computer somewhere.
I forgot to warn you about that trick drawer.
Don't worry. I'll clean it up.
I still don't see your platinum card.
It'll turn up.
I guess it is your turn to pay.
Deal.
Aiden, what happened?
The Graysons could see you--
I don't care.
It's done.
They made it look like an overdose.
Aiden...
Aiden, I'm so sorry.
But you can't trust these people.
You can't trust this.
Listen to me--
Listen to you?
I did listen to you,
and that's exactly how this happened.
You made me believe that they were manipulating me,
giving me false hope,
when it's you I shouldn't have trusted.
If there's a chance that my sister's alive,
then I'm gonna find her.
Aiden-- and if she is dead...
Then this is on you.
Aiden.
Aiden!
