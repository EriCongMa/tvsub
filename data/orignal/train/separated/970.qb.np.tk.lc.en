a proposal was made ...
your niece came to my restaurant ,
asked me for a hostessing job .
i &apos;m sorry .
another was broken .
oh , katherine , you don &apos;t have to ...
mike , please .
a secret was kept ...
carlos is gonna find out about this thing eventually .
by then , i will have proved i can
do the job , pregnant or not .
she &apos;s still unconscious . i &apos;d like to
run some tests . another &apos;s revealed .
julie &apos;s pregnant .
bree van de kamp was having an affair .
and whenever her lover called ...
she needed an excuse to leave work early .
i &apos;m off to the jeweler &apos;s .
gotta get my pearls restrung .
i &apos;m off to the salon .
gotta keep this red hair red .
i have to visit my aunt in the hospital .
she has shingles .
but on this particular day ,
bree was surprised to find
her work had been done for her .
morning .
katherine , it &apos;s barely nine .
how long have you been cooking ?
i don &apos;t know . since three , four .
you don &apos;t need to do this whole luncheon by yourself .
well , i don &apos;t mind .
when i &apos;m happy , i have all this excess energy .
gotta channel it somewhere .
oh , you must be pretty darn happy .
any particular reason ?
isn &apos;t it obvious ?
i &apos;m in love .
that &apos;s wonderful !
why didn &apos;t you tell me you were seeing someone ?
you know what ? it doesn &apos;t matter .
the main thing is you &apos;re finally over mike .
i &apos;m not over mike .
you &apos;re not ?
no , silly , who &apos;d you think i was in love with ?
but mike just married susan .
oh , honey. their first marriage went down in flames .
this one &apos;s gonna crash even faster .
they &apos;re not even sleeping together .
what makes you say that ?
last night , the light in the upstair den was on at 3 : 00 a.m.
that doesn &apos;t mean anything .
maybe susan wanted to read without waking him .
no . mike made a mistake and he knows it .
he &apos;s just waiting for julie to feel better ,
and then he &apos;ll dump susan and beg me to take him back .
so ... grab an apron . we still have dessert to make .
i &apos;m thinking tarte tatin .
it &apos;s mike &apos;s favorite . we &apos;ll make an extra one for him .
poor bree .
she wanted to help her friend .
but she didn &apos;t have time
to deal with katherine &apos;s imaginary lover ...
i have a teeth cleaning , so i won &apos;t be able to help you .
not when she had a real one .
you wouldn &apos;t know it to look at him ,
but that nice man who delivers your mail
hits his wife .
you &apos;d never guess by her smile ,
but that nice woman across the street
embezzles from her boss .
and that attractive couple who jogs by every morning ?
well , they like their cocaine .
the sad truth is ,
we don &apos;t know our friends and neighbors
nearly as well as we think we do .
even the people we love ...
keep secrets .
need coffee .
well , this isn &apos;t helping you get your coffee .
whatever. it &apos;s wakin &apos; me up .
hey , bud . hey , what are you still doin &apos; home ?
i thought you had a morning class .
actually , i &apos;m thinking about quitting school .
what ?
yeah . i thought i might get a job .
danny , our family &apos;s been in this country five generations .
it &apos;s time one of us got a diploma .
okay , what &apos;s going on ?
talk to me .
no one talks to me at school , no one sits near me ,
and everybody thinks i &apos;m the perv who attacked julie .
look , this is a temporary thing .
the police are gonna catch this guy ,
and everyone will know you are innocent .
yeah , but meanwhile , i &apos;m the campus freak .
baby , do me a favor. let &apos;s talk about this later .
if you go to school today ,
we &apos;ll figure something out when you get home , okay ?
okay .
okay .
why you being so nice to him ?
there is no way we are lettin &apos; him drop out of school .
i know that
but we have to be careful here .
you know danny--
when he gets unhappy , he gets sloppy ,
says all sorts of things he shouldn &apos;t .
okay .
so now all we &apos;ve gotta do
is figure out how to make a teenager happy .
damn it !
what &apos;s the matter ?
oh . nothing fits .
my breasts have gotten huge .
oh , yeah . i hate it when that happens .
every time i &apos;m pregnant--
second trimester like clockwork . bam !
why are you smiling ?
why do you think ?
&quot; the supremes &quot; are back .
what did i tell you about naming them musical groups ?
i know .
it &apos;s just that &quot; benny and the jets &quot;
are so happy to see &apos; em .
this is serious .
i have to hide these things at work
so carlos doesn &apos;t find out i &apos;m pregnant .
what am i gonna do with you guys ?
i got some ideas .
hey , hey , i got a meeting .
wait , but--but they &apos;re only like this for two weeks
until they get all sore ,
and you give me that &quot; don &apos;t touch me &quot; look .
okay . good @-@ bye , tom
oh , come on. no , lynette , come on . call in sick .
kids get snow days .
we could call it a boob day .
okay , it is way too early for the &quot; don &apos;t touch me &quot; look .
so i waited around all morning , carlos ,
for that repairman that you told me to call ,
and he never showed .
no , i &apos;m not done . i &apos;m sharing my day with you .
then your children took my $ 300 perfume
and gave their dolls a bath .
yes , i spent $ 300 on perfume . but you &apos;re missing the point !
oh , really ? you don &apos;t like it when i yell ?
well , how about this ?
i have taken care of your demon spawn children
for 12 hours . my shift is over .
so , you , uh , having fun working at the restaurant ?
i &apos;m having fun working with you .
oh ! look who &apos;s here .
hi , gabrielle .
i was talking to her .
so ... i thought i was gonna pick you up .
john offered to give me a ride .
and i appreciated the company .
okay , time to go inside .
someone &apos;s got homework .
bye .
night .
you remember homework , john--
that thing that kids in high school have to do ?
i remember it . i think you used to help me with mine .
what are you doing with her , john ?
i take care of my employees
really ? do you drive the busboys home , too ?
i will pick her up from now on .
come on .
hey there .
how &apos;s she doing ?
much better .
the doctor says the swelling in her brain has subsided
she could come to at any moment .
that &apos;s terrific .
mm . julie , you should see the flowers andrew brought you .
they &apos;re gorgeous .
it &apos;s the least i could do .
julie knows how i feel about her . don &apos;t you , jules ?
i love that you two have stayed friends all these years .
yeah , well , we--we kind of lost touch
when she was in med school ,
but--but ever since she quit ...
i mean , we talk all the time
she quit med school ?
i @-@ i thought she told you . it was six months ago .
she &apos;s been out of school for six months ?
you are so lucky you &apos;re in a coma right now .
what has she been doing all this time ?
she didn &apos;t know what she wanted to do with her life ,
so while she was deciding , she got herself a job ...
waiting tables .
did you just say &quot; waiting tables &quot; ?
i thought she--
told me ?
yeah , no , she didn &apos;t .
this is unreal .
yesterday , i found out julie thought she was pregnant .
and now i &apos;m finding out that my daughter the surgeon
is actually my daughter the ... waitress .
i &apos;m gonna need a moment .
take your time . i &apos;ll--i &apos;ll just ...
wait !
the guy .
what guy ?
julie was seeing some guy .
you two talk all the time .
what do you know ?
now would be an excellent time to wake up and help me .
andrew , who is he ?
he may be the one that attacked her .
all i know is there was a guy , but
i don &apos;t know his name .
why would she tell you she &apos;s seeing someone , not say who .
because he &apos;s married .
what you got there ?
mints .
mints ?
mints that are ...
&quot; ribbed for her pleasure &quot; ? !
yeah , we found a whole box of them under ana &apos;s bed .
ana !
can i have one before dinner ?
no ! no , you can &apos;t eat these !
these aren &apos;t mints . they &apos;re ... balloons .
grownup balloons .
do you and daddy play with them ?
if we did , you and i wouldn &apos;t be having this conversation .
nice knock .
what are these ?
well , those are condoms .
you see , when a boy and a girl like each other--
shut it . juanita and celia found these under your bed .
okay , i want a lock on my door .
i &apos;ve got news for you .
that is not where the lock is gonna go .
this is really none of your business .
sorry . 17 plus condoms ? totally my business .
what &apos;s the story ? are you sleeping with john rowland ?
aunt gaby , he &apos;s my boss .
ah ! and the oscar goes to ... not you .
okay , fine .
but we haven &apos;t done anything ...
yet .
&quot; yet &quot; ? why is there a &quot; yet &quot; ?
i love him .
did you hear me ? i said i love him .
i heard you . i was swallowing vomit .
you and john-- not gonna happen .
what is it about john that gets you so crazy ?
he was just your gardener .
i &apos;m not crazy ! and this conversation is over .
i promised the girls
they could fill these with water and drop them off the roof .
come on , kids . let &apos;s go !
hey , porter. can i talk to you ?
hey , mrs. bolen .
uh , sorry . i &apos;ve gotta go pick up penny from school .
this &apos;ll just take a minute .
okay .
so , uh , this friday night , what do you say you help me
throw danny a little party at our place ?
a party ?
yeah . he needs to make some friends .
he &apos;s a little shy ,
and this whole thing with julie has not helped .
okay , here &apos;s the thing . danny and i don &apos;t hang out .
we don &apos;t have that much in common .
well ... danny likes money .
do you like money ?
sure .
see ? you do have something in common .
are you bribing me ?
no . this is to pay for the party .
and , of course , if there &apos;s a little left over ...
and i almost forgot .
you can &apos;t have a party without beer .
okay , is this a trick ?
is my mother hiding in the bushes
to see if i take the bait ?
i just want him to have a good time .
so make sure you invite some nice people ,
maybe a couple of cute girls .
anything for my good friend danny .
all right , how about this one ?
it &apos;s a lovely 4 @-@ tier cake with pink fondant .
okay .
well , after showing you 43 cake designs ,
i &apos;ve learned that &quot; hmm &quot; means &quot; no . &quot;
but you &apos;re getting married in two days ,
so unless you wanna shove wedding jell @-@ o
into each other &apos;s faces , you really need to make a decision .
oh , i &apos;m sorry . we just want everything to be perfect and--
what &apos;s this one ?
oh , this must be a new design by my partner katherine .
you like it ?
i love it .
wonderful .
now ... what flavor do you want ?
i would suggest
a classic white cake with raspberry genoise .
hey , carlos , notice anything different about lynette ?
what are you talking about ?
check her in this photo from the christmas party last year
before ...
after .
lynette got implants .
definitely . and look at those puppies .
wait a minute . aren &apos;t you gay ?
you can &apos;t ask me that .
well , if you &apos;re not ,
i &apos;m gonna have to punch you in the face
for checking out my married friend .
so gay !
judy @-@ liza @-@ barbra gay !
proud member since &apos; 89 !
so for the third quarter ,
net income increased by 20 % compared to ...
what are you looking at ?
sorry , lynette . i just ...
i know .
you know what ?
your little secret .
oh , god , you know about the twins ?
well , i mean , yeah . i have eyes .
okay , first of all , this was not planned .
it wasn &apos;t ?
god , no ! tom and i went out to dinner ,
he got me drunk , and the next thing ii knew ...
so tom &apos;s responsible for all this .
well ... who else ?
god , you are such a good wife .
i wish you &apos;d talk to gaby ,
get her to jump on the bandwagon .
thus ... gaby already have her hands full
with the two she &apos;s got ?
mnh , they &apos;re okay .
i always thought we could do better
what ? ! you know , gaby really looks up to you .
if she knew you got a boob job
she might consider it .
boob job ?
sorry . breast enhancement .
just give her the name of your doctor .
he did great work .
oh , now i ...
o @-@ okay . got it .
sure .
by the way , let this be a lesson to you .
don &apos;t try to hide things from me .
i &apos;m a little too sharp for that . okay .
susan ?
here .
hey , i , uh , just got called on a job .
it &apos;s just a busted water main ,
so i should be back by ... whoa .
what happened here ?
i came across julie &apos;s journal .
okay .
she never says his name .
whose name ?
the married man she &apos;s been seeing .
she doesn &apos;t use his name . she just uses the initial-- &quot; d. &quot;
why would she use a code in her own journal ?
oh , because she &apos;s afraid her mom might come across it ?
okay , i know that i am invading her privacy .
i mean , screw it . this is an emergency .
i bet this d. is the sick bastard who ...
and you know the worst part ?
i read this and ...
it &apos;s like it was written by a stranger .
i mean , who is this girl ?
she dropped out of med school ,
she leaves her full scholarship to wait tables ,
and then when she came back ,
she started an affair with a married man .
i don &apos;t know that julie .
i mean , what is going on with her ?
hello ?
really ?
you can ask her yourself . she &apos;s awake .
dr. hill ? how is she ? can i see her ?
yeah , just so you know ,
she doesn &apos;t remember anything about being attacked .
she &apos;s very tired and needs her rest ,
so just sit with her , okay ? no questions .
of course .
i &apos;ll just ... sit .
oh , julie .
it is so good to see you awake .
hey , mom .
oh , how are you feeling ?
oh , wait . i forgot .
doctor said no questions .
so .. i &apos;m just gonna sit here and ... look at you .
thanks .
i &apos;m really tired .
oh . well , you just sleep , baby .
just so you know , you &apos;re not pregnant .
what ?
well , lynette said you were scared you might be .
but you &apos;re not , so ...
yay !
she shouldn &apos;t have told you that .
oh . now i &apos;ve upset you . i &apos;m sorry .
uh , just ignore me and you sleep .
okay .
if you want ,
i could tell your boyfriend that you &apos;re better .
my boyfriend ?
well , i knew you thought that you were pregnant ,
and i don &apos;t see you going the turkey baster route ,
so i just assumed that you had a boyfriend .
i could call him for you .
ugh , mom .
unless you think he strangled you
because he &apos;s married .
i don &apos;t want to talk about this now .
then we won &apos;t .
i &apos;m not even here . you just rest .
how can i rest
when you come in here with all these questions ?
have i asked you one single question ?
i mean , besides that one ?
i think you should go .
julie , please . i am your mom .
there is not a thing that you can &apos;t tell me .
i know , and i &apos;m telling you to go .
okay .
i miss you , too .
a peach nightgown . why ?
karl , we are not doing this on the phone again !
if you can &apos;t sleep , take a pill .
katherine , i &apos;m glad you &apos;re here .
we , uh , really need to talk
if it &apos;s about
ordering the tents for the henderson reunion ,
already done .
i saw you at mike and susan &apos;s last night .
you were spying on me ?
i am not the spy in this story .
okay , you saw me .
want to know what i saw ?
susan went to bed early , and mike watched a ball game .
does that sound like a marriage to you ?
that sounds exactly like a marriage .
all i know is ,
it was really nice
to watch a ball game with mike again .
through a window !
katherine , you are losing your grip here .
mike loves susan . he is not coming back to you .
and if you can &apos;t accept that ,
then you really need to get some help .
you just cannot stand to see me happy , can you ?
okay , i realize you &apos;re upset-- because
you know that once i get mike back
i am gonna have more in my life than just work .
and i &apos;m not gonna be able to do your job for you .
excuse me ?
you &apos;re never here anymore , bree .
you &apos;re always so busy these days .
but you &apos;re never too busy
to take bows for the food that i cooked ,
and i am tired of carrying you !
okay , well , that &apos;s gonna stop right now .
because i am putting you on sick leave for three weeks ,
effective immediately .
i &apos;m not sick .
yes , you are .
now go .
you &apos;ve got some admirers out there .
oh ?
yeah , as you walked by ,
i heard one of them say ,
&quot; check out the rack on that one . &quot;
can i do the honors and call security ?
no , and here &apos;s why .
they &apos;re the bertollini brothers .
they &apos;ve got a $ 200 million pension fund
they &apos;re looking for somebody to run .
why are you telling this to &quot; the rack &quot; ?
just listen . we take them to dinner ,
they admire the girls up close and personal ,
then we close the deal .
and then they leave the money on the dresser , right ?
what , you &apos;re mad ?
yeah . of course i &apos;m mad .
you can &apos;t use my breasts as bait .
where do you get this attitude ?
come on . you don &apos;t buy christmas ornaments
unless you &apos;re gonna hang &apos; em on a tree .
okay , bad metaphor .
my point is , why would you get those things
if you don &apos;t want people looking at them ?
i guess ...
i ...
i wouldn &apos;t have .
okay .
when do we do this ?
tomorrow night .
and if it makes you feel any better ,
buy yourself a new dress ...
on the company .
a man just gave me a credit card because of my boobs .
that makes me feel less like a hooker .
john .
hey , gaby . what &apos;s up ?
if my niece has her way , her skirt .
excuse me ?
you pulled out the old john rowland charm ,
and now ana has fallen for you .
so she has a little crush . i think it &apos;s sweet .
no , no , no .
&quot; sweet &quot; would be doodling your name in her notebook .
ana bought condoms in what looked like a valu @-@ pack .
wow . i had no idea she was that serious .
i mean , i was only flirting with her ... a little .
well , she &apos;s 17,
so you &apos;re also flirting with an orange jumpsuit .
you &apos;re pretty worked up about this .
you should be , too .
if you lay one finger on ana ,
carlos will knock every tooth out of your mouth ,
which will make you pretty darn popular in prison .
look , i &apos;m not really into ana .
okay , i was flirting with her
to see if you still cared .
and obviously , you do .
no , i don &apos;t .
really ?
uh , if you weren &apos;t jealous ,
then why &apos;d you forbid me to drive ana home ?
because i remember what you could accomplish
in a parked car .
look , i think about those days a lot , gaby .
i mean , i was just a kid .
you know ,
i had to mow lawns for a living ,
and i couldn &apos;t offer you anything but--but sex .
but now i can offer you so much more .
w @-@ what are you talking about ?
i have a lot of money now , gaby .
you know , and--and you &apos;re stuck in a house
with two kids and a husband who &apos;s never home .
and when i saw you again ,
with macaroni and cheese on your t @-@ shirt ,
i said to myself , &quot; what a shame .
&quot; you know , this gorgeous woman
should be sipping champagne on a yacht . &quot;
so ... what , you &apos;re gonna rescue me ?
tell me you &apos;re not unhappy .
i &apos;m not .
why don &apos;t i believe you ?
ana , wait !
carlos ?
he isn &apos;t home yet .
ana , we have to talk .
you knew that i liked him . how could you do this ?
okay , what you saw wasn &apos;t what you thought it was .
oh , did you slip ,
and your tongue accidentally fell into john &apos;s mouth ?
i didn &apos;t kiss john ! john kissed me !
and no tongues were involved !
yeah , well , you have your version . i have mine .
we &apos;ll see which one uncle carlos believes .
okay , aana , i &apos;m gonna tell you something .
ten years ago ,
john rowland and i ...
had an affair .
your uncle carlos knows about it .
a lot of people got hurt .
but we survived it .
i have no more feelings for john .
but today i found out he still has feelings for me .
i saw you staring at this the other day .
i didn &apos;t understand it then .
now i do .
ana ...
i was staring at a memory . yes .
and sometimes when i &apos;m having a rough day ,
i think about what might have been .
but trust me , i would never go back .
look , ana , i love your uncle iarlos ,
and we have a wonderful life together .
please , do not do anything that &apos;s gonna hurt him .
hey , guys .
finally got home early .
mmm . so what &apos;s new ?
i was just telling aunt gaby ...
that i wanna quit my job .
anyway , i have homework .
mom ?
i found this on my bed .
you like it ?
yeah . what &apos;s the occasion ?
the party . i want you to look good .
you didn &apos;t have to do that .
why not ? i wanted to buy something nice for my son .
besides , it made me feel less guilty
about buying this for me .
cute , huh ?
yeah
wait till you see it on me .
are you ever gonna get that thing taken care of ?
what , the scar ?
mnh . i don &apos;t even see it anymore .
they can get rid of those things these days , mom .
yeah , but that costs money .
so ?
we have to be careful about money. you know that .
i don &apos;t see dad being careful .
he bought a new set of golf clubs .
danny , listen to me .
after the explosion , i was in bad shape .
you father took real good care of me .
he hung in there .
he &apos;s a good man . don &apos;t you forget that .
one day , i &apos;m gonna make a lot of money ,
and we &apos;re gonna get that scar fixed .
oh , honey .
and don &apos;t worry .
whatever happens , i &apos;m gonna take care of you .
whoa . check out the dress . it &apos;s fantastic .
what &apos;d it cost ?
my dignity .
worth every penny .
aren &apos;t you going to check your jacket ?
well , it &apos;s a little chilly in here .
lynette , it &apos;s not chilly .
and even if it was , that &apos;s more
of a reason to lose jacket .
come on . it &apos;s just for one night .
fine .
i will check this for you . go meet the guys .
and there he is now .
hey , i was just telling these guys about--
hey , could i talk to you for a sec , dad ?
yeah , excuse me for a second .
what are you doing ?
what , i can &apos;t talk to people ?
a lot of people are here ,
but you pick a couple 20 @-@ year @-@ old girls ?
danny , come on . i &apos;m saying hello
to a couple of your friends .
yeah , well , don &apos;t .
you know , i &apos;ve been gettin &apos; this
vibe from you for a while now ,
and i don &apos;t think i deserve it .
oh , i think you do .
you do ? why is that ?
because i know .
you know what , son ?
jeez , nick ! what the hell ? !
what do you gotta crash every party in the world ?
i bet you want him the hell out of here .
i &apos;m on it . have fun , baby . come on .
hi , sweetheart .
hooker &apos;s home .
how did it go ?
it was bizarre .
from the moment i walked in with the girls here ,
i got smiles , winks . men pulled out my chair .
the busboy filled my water glass every two minutes .
and the bertollini brothers ,
who think our proposal was written on my cleavage ,
were putty in my hands .
they signed the deal on the spot !
that &apos;s great !
congratulations .
so why are men so obsessed with these things ?
i don &apos;t know what to say , honey .
i mean , some guys , uh , are just breast men .
&quot; some guys , &quot; huh ?
me ? i appreciate all aspects of the female--
i &apos;m up here , tom . come on .
come on , i &apos;ve seen pictures of your old girlfriends .
just admit it .
okay . my name is tom.scavo , and i like big breasts .
but you married me .
man , i stepped right into that one , didn &apos;t i ?
so let me ask you . you ever feel like you compromised ?
yeah .
okay , i &apos;m giving you one chance to start over .
no , no , no , no. i ...
i need you to not be perfect .
why ?
because i &apos;m not perfect .
i &apos;m not ... rich .
i &apos;m not brilliant .
i &apos;m not movie star handsome .
if you didn &apos;t have this one flaw ,
i would spend every moment of every day wondering ,
what the heck is she doing with me ?
you may not be brilliant ,
but you can tiptoe through a minefield
better than anyone i know .
well done .
i tried to wait up , but today was just too much .
what happened ?
well , the repairman finally showed up ,
but he didn &apos;t have the right part so he left again .
then celia hid my car keys
so i couldn &apos;t take her to the dentist .
then she forgot where she put them .
i told them both
they &apos;d be sorry when their father got home ,
except you didn &apos;t ... until now .
i &apos;m sorry , gaby .
it &apos;s okay .
it &apos;s kind of funny when you think about it .
what ?
my life .
it just seems so small sometimes .
i spend my days
thinking about detergent and groceries ...
or how i &apos;m gonna get the spot out of the upholstery .
it &apos;s not at all
the life i thought i &apos;d choose for myself .
but some days ,
i look up ,
and i realize i &apos;m happy .
i &apos;m honest to god happy with my life .
anyway , i just thought you might like to know that .
can i help you with that ?
katherine .
you &apos;re supposed to be on sick leave .
i &apos;m better. really .
now what can i do ?
i don &apos;t want to fight .
neither do i .
i &apos;ve lost so much these past few weeks .
my job and your friendship . it &apos;s ...
it &apos;s all i have left , and i can &apos;t lose those .
oh , honey .
so ... are we friends again ?
of course .
i &apos;ve just been worried about you , that &apos;s all .
but if you say you &apos;re better , then .... i believe you .
good , because i really , really am .
what the hell is that ?
oh , that &apos;s the cake .
no , that &apos;s my cake .
yes . the bride saw your design and just loved it .
no , it &apos;s my cake--
the one i designed for my wedding--
mine and mike &apos;s .
well , aren &apos;t you glad we found a good use for it ?
after i watched another bride marry my fiance
i am not going to watch another bride eat my cake .
well , no one says you have to watch , dear .
katherine , i know you &apos;re upset ,
but don &apos;t you dare take it out on that cake !
it &apos;s mine . and if i can &apos;t have it , nobody will .
katherine , don &apos;t you touch that cake !
let go !
help ! somebody help !
stop that woman !
it &apos;s mine !
... to be my lawfully wedded wife and one true love .
i promise to cherish , honor and protect you ,
and to love you more each day than i did the day before .
you may now kiss the bride .
katherine , no !
good to see you out of bed .
i &apos;m sorry about yesterday .
so ... have you remembered anything else about the attack ?
nothing .
uh , julie ,
you know , everybody wants to see the guy who did this
off the streets , but the police don &apos;t have much to go on .
so ... if they could talk to this man that you &apos;re seeing
mom .
maybe they could cross him off the list .
he didn &apos;t do it .
and i &apos;m not seeing him anymore , okay ?
i broke it off .
you broke it off ?
well , that &apos;s a motive right there .
at least let them question him .
if he &apos;s innocent , he has nothing to lose .
except for his family when they find out .
so now you &apos;re concerned about his family .
what did you say ?
you heard me , julie .
for god sake , what are you thinking , dating a married man ?
don &apos;t do this .
i am your mother . i love you .
i have spent the last five days sitting there ,
not sleeping , not eating .
don &apos;t shut me out .
i was lonely. okay ?
he was nice .
it--it just happened .
i don &apos;t see how .
this is not something you would do .
well , guess what ?
i &apos;m not perfect anymore .
that perfect daughter you remember
who was always there when you needed her ,
who held everything together when you were falling apart ?
she &apos;s grown up , and she &apos;s going to make mistakes .
you wanna make mistakes ? fine .
dye your hair , drop out of school . i don &apos;t care .
i never expected you to be perfect ,
but i didn &apos;t raise you to do something this stupid .
you know what an affair like this can do .
you saw it firsthand .
morning .
katherine ?
where do you think you &apos;re going ?
to the test kitchen .
we need to start prep on the berman bar mitzvah .
yesterday , you nearly destroyed my company &apos;s reputation .
today you &apos;re worried about prep work ?
i don &apos;t want to talk about yesterday .
it won &apos;t happen again .
that &apos;s right , because you &apos;re fired .
i &apos;m sorry , but i see no other way
to get you realize how serious this is .
you have got to give up this obsession with mike
before it ruins your life .
i need to work . it &apos;s all that &apos;s keeping me going .
you need help , counseling .
i &apos;m telling you this as your friend .
you are not my friend .
yes , i am .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m taking such a firm hand .
your only job now is to get better .
katherine ...
i &apos;m gonna need you to give me your keys .
there ya go .
a souvenir of our ... friendship .
you wouldn &apos;t think of it to look at her ,
but the lady next door is having a nervous breakdown .
you &apos;d never guess by her smile ,
but the wife of your uncle once betrayed his trust .
and that daughter you adore ...
well , she &apos;s having an affair with a married man .
the sad truth is ,
we don &apos;t know our friends and neighbors
nearly as well as we think we do .
even the people we trust most ...
keep secrets .
hey , julie .
it &apos;s dominic .
