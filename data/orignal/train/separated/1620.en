You wrote the code in labview?
Do it again in java.
Why are you being such a bitch?
Because bitches get things done.
We both know that I'm not smart enough for you,
and that's why you won't date me.
You broke my heart.
Is that Mariana?
What the hell is she doing?
I don't think I'm really ready to smoke pot.
The thing is we're not smoking it.
We're eating it.
So I looked into Kyle's alibi witness, Patrick Molloy,
and it turns out that he was arrested
for lewd and lascivious acts with a minor.
I think I might know why the prosecutor didn't want
Kyle's lawyer to see the forensics report.
It says that the killer was right-handed,
but kyle's left-handed.
I have some tax issues with the IRS.
Are we going to lose our home?
So?
So?
That was...
Pretty terrible.
Oh! Yeah.
The worst.
Ever.
You know what I was thinking?
I was thinking maybe we could try again.
You know, see if...
You can could do better?
Me?
You started it, woman.
I'm gonna have to show you my "A" Game.
It sure was good for your "B" Game.
Let's see, I think I have some left-over chinese.
Did you hear something?
No.
How about pizza? What are you in the mood for?
Oh, whatever's easiest.
I got a lot of homework tonight anyway.
I'll, uh, let AJ know we're home.
Uh, yeah?
Hey, it's me.
Uh, I didn't end up working that extra shift after all, so, uh...
Yeah, I invited Brandon to dinner
and, uh, he's here.
We're both here. So, uh, if you, uh--
How's pizza sound?
Uh, yeah, pizza sounds good.
I can't find my bra.
Uh, pepperoni, mushroom?
Uh, yeah.
Hey.
Hey.
Oh, hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Uh, we were just...
Studying for calculus.
Chemistry.
Uh, Callie, do you want to join us for dinner?
Uh, no, actually, I, um, have to--
I have to be home...
But thanks.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
The only way that we'll be ready in time for competition
is if the whole robotics team is working 24/7:
Before school, during lunch,
after school, free periods, even nights.
Well, is it okay if I schedule in some time to sleep?
You can sleep when it's over.
Well, look who decided to join us.
Sorry, I was doing homework at AJ's,
and we lost track of time.
Okay, family dinner is not an option.
It's the only time I get to see all of your beautiful faces.
Oh yeah? Then why don't you make Brandon come?
Um, Brandon was actually at Mike's for dinner.
How nice. Maybe if we're lucky, one of these days
we'll be graced with his presence too.
Mariana, please put your cell phone away
at the dinner table.
Well, can I be excused then?
Yes.
No!
What? We just sat down.
But she's the first female team leader,
it's a big deal.
Are there any more potatoes?
He speaks!
What? Who?
You and your brother are going to
eat us out of house and home.
Uh, speaking of house,
Has anyone heard from Gabe lately?
Uh, no, why?
Because he hasn't been by to work on the garage in days,
and I'm starting to think he's blowing us off.
Well, he was-- he was here yesterday
when I got home from school.
He was? Doesn't look like he did much.
Well, he's gonna get it done! What's the hurry, anyway?
Hey, watch your tone.
It's the principle of the matter, Jesus.
All right? We did something for Gabe,
and in exchange he promised to do something for us.
He needs to keep his word.
Well, he is. Jeez.
Hello?
Hey, sorry, did I-- did I wake you?
No, no, what's-- what's up?
Um, yeah, is everything okay?
I mean, you've been kind of MIA,
and my moms are starting to wonder what's going on.
Yeah, sorry.
I, uh, haven't been feeling that good, so...
Uh, okay.
Okay, well, um, look, you-- you got to get back here,
because they really want to get this remodel finished.
Got it. I'll be there tomorrow...
For sure.
Okay.
The rent on the houses big enough for all of us
is higher than our mortgage.
What about apartments?
Really? We're all gonna move into an apartment with no yard?
You think the kids bicker now?
When they're all on top of each other with nowhere to go--
How are you okay with losing our home,
all the memories that we have here?
I am not okay. I'm not okay at all,
But what am I supposed to do?
Let the IRS throw my dad in jail?
That's a stretch, Lena.
That's not what you told him,
and what if he does drive himself off a cliff like he said?
He was being melodramatic.
He's not gonna kill himself.
All the stress might kill him.
I still say that we should talk to the IRS, you know?
See what other options we have.
And what if they do offer us a payment plan?
Where is that money gonna come from?
We barely make enough money right now
as it is to pay our bills.
We'll take on other jobs if we have to.
What about... Asking your mom?
No, no, absolutely not.
I'm not asking my mother to bail out your father.
That's not what I--
You'd be asking her to save our home.
I'm not asking my mother for money, Lena.
It's just not gonna happen.
I know that this is heart-breaking...
For all of us.
But my dad, he needs the money
that we're gonna get from the sale,
The money that he--
he gave us in the first place to buy this place.
How can you expect me to save our asses
and then let my parents hang out to dry?
Careful, Mason.
Okay, Mason, no coloring on my sheet music!
Okay, you can draw in your coloring books.
That's it, okay?
Did he? I'm sorry.
It's okay, it's not a big deal.
No, no, Mason!
That's not a toy! Cort, can you please?
Mason, do what Brandon says. Okay?
That's not yours.
Sorry, I'm just going over my work schedule.
I mean, he's not really hurting it, right?
No, I guess not. Um, I got to go.
Oh, don't forget you're picking up Mason
from preschool this afternoon.
Oh, damn. Well, I was--
I was hoping I would get some time to practice.
There's not a lot of time before the audition.
I get it, but I mean if we're gonna make rent this month,
I can't miss work again.
Well, maybe Eddie can take him?
Well, until this custody thing is settled
I can't ask eddie to take him when it's not his turn.
I have to prove that I can handle Mason by myself.
Detective, really?
Yeah, I've been thinking about it for a while.
You ready to leave the beat for the good old boys club?
It pays more. I've got five kids going off to college
sometime soon, hopefully.
Those good old boys are just gonna have to get ready
for this good old girl.
So, um, I came home early yesterday.
AJ and Callie were in his room,
and, uh, I'm pretty sure they were, uh...
Having sex?
Yeah.
I mean, it's Callie. I thought you should know.
Yeah, I appreciate it.
So what? I should...
tell AJ they can't be doing that
in my place any more, right?
I'm not really sure we can make 'em stop.
You know, remember what you were like at that age.
No.
Well, if they're gonna be having sex,
I'd rather them do it some place safe.
You know, not a car or god knows where.
You will have a conversation with him about wearing a condom?
Yeah, of course.
But-- I mean, what? You're okay with this?
Uh, I guess.
Are you?
Yeah, I guess,
but, um, Brandon was with me.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah. I wonder if it was weird for him?
Oh, please, it was a long time ago.
They're siblings now.
Plus, Brandon's living with his girlfriend.
I guess so.
Have anything to say about how that's going?
Well, he seems pretty determined to live with her
until he goes off to Juilliard.
If he gets in.
If not, I don't know how he can afford
to pay rent on an apartment.
Wait a minute? He's paying the rent?
And a lot more.
He has no more money left.
What do you mean? What about the money for the hand settlement?
He gave it all to her.
What?
The mailbox is full
and cannot accept any messages at this time. Good-bye.
忘了拿体育课的东西
Can I help you
or do I need to invest in a "No Loitering" sign?
Sorry, um, I, um--
I heard that you could, um, hook me up.
You know, with some, uh...
Green.
You mean pot?
Sure, what kind?
Uh, do you have gummy worms?
I don't carry edibles. I meant, "What strain?"
Indica or sativa?
I, uh, usually go with indigo.
Indica?
Right, yeah.
Do you want it loose or rolled?
Never mind, rolled.
Got it.
Every time I finish picking up,
hurricane Mason's already made another lap
around the apartment.
Oh, no need to apologize.
Uh, hey, I'm sorry for stopping by.
I didn't have your number.
Oh, that's fine.
Can I get you something to drink?
No thanks.
I was hoping to talk to you about Brandon.
Okay.
Look, first of all, I just want to say
that I'm supportive of your relationship.
I think you're a very nice girl
and you clearly care for Brandon.
It's just that, uh...
all this is a lot of responsibility
at any age, but especially at 18.
I mean, he hasn't even graduated high school.
Look, I didn't ask for Brandon to move in with me.
I have no doubt that this was his idea.
Just like I'm sure you didn't ask him
for the money he gave you.
I didn't ask for the money.
Look, that's the thing about Brandon.
He doesn't have to be asked.
He sees a pretty girl in need,
and he feels like he has to save her.
Well, I don't need any saving.
I can take care of myself and my son.
Well, I'm sure you can,
which is why I--
I was hoping you could, uh, encourage him to move back home.
I'm not sure what I could say.
Well, I mean,
you could, uh...
tell him that it's confusing for your son
to live with a man that isn't his father.
You think I'm confusing my son?
You know, your son's pretty confused too.
Yeah, I agree.
But not about me.
I mean, do you have any idea why he's living here?
I mean, I think I do, yeah.
It's because he's not comfortable living at home.
Why is that?
Because his moms are blaming him
for everything that happened with Callie.
They think it's all his responsibility,
and he doesn't want to live with them
looking over his shoulder every day
like he's some kind of creep.
What do you mean?
What do you mean, "Everything that happened with callie"?
They had sex!
And the only reason I'm telling you this
is 'cause I'm tired of everyone acting like
Brandon's the one being selfish,
when really he's just trying to make things easier
for everybody else.
And his moms know?
Yes.
And that's why
there's nothing I can say to get him to move home.

All right!
我需要你
All right.

So-- so did you find Molloy?
We did, um...
Unfortunately, he doesn't remember that day,
but he's not saying that you weren't at the rec center,
he just-- you know, it was four years ago.
But the good news is we found something else.
We've been going through your lawyer's files,
and there was a missing page in the forensics report,
and it said that the killer most likely was right-handed.
Well, I'm left-handed.
I know, so Aaron's gonna
talk to the lawyers at JJC,
hopefully it'll be enough for them to take on your case.
You know, if they can prove that this page
was deliberately withheld from your attorney,
this could be huge.
What's wrong?
I spent a lot of time trying to get used to the idea
that I was probably gonna die in prison.
It's been a while since I've had any hope.
No.
No, no, okay, what were you thinking
running wire on the exterior?
You're just asking for it to get cut on the field.
But I-
These kinds of mistakes
are gonna get us slaughtered.
Okay.
All right, um...
Here, I'll do it myself.
Someone's a little tense today.
Okay, we don't have time to keep building
and rebuilding this robot
if we want to be ready for competition in three days.
But you do have time to go visit Nick?
Can we not talk about that right now?
So you're not stressed about it?
He's locked up.
Not that locked up if he has access to a phone
and is texting you constantly.
Oh, and where have you been?
I-- I hit my head and...
Whatever!
Just help Emma mount the shooter.
Where is my soldering iron?
Yeah, don't worry. I'm sure I'm fine.
It's probably just a concussion.
She's been like this all day.
Yeah, welcome to the last 16 years of my life.
What did you do?
I just got into it with a nail gun.
You should see the other guy-- gun. Never mind.
Does it hurt?
Yeah, I mean, a little.
You don't have any aspirin, do you?
Yeah.
So what are you doing with a nail gun?
Um, I was helping Gabe out with the garage remodel.
He hasn't been showing up,
so my moms are kind of freaking out,
but can we not tell Mariana?
Okay.
Do you think he's blowing the job off?
No, no, no, he's-- he's sick.
No, he wouldn't do that. He's a good guy.
Well, I think you're a good guy for helping him.
Uh, a good enough guy to, uh...
have another chance...
with you?
I-- I haven't had time
to think about that.
Okay.
Hey! Less talky, more worky.
Can I have some of those?
My head is killing me!
Yeah, if her head doesn't kill her,
I might have to.
Hey, what are you doing here?
Well, don't sound so happy to see me.
Sorry, I just, um...
What's going on? Is everything okay?
Uh, well,
I've just been thinking a lot about the house.
You know? Um...
so I asked my mom
if she would help us out.
And?
Well, she doesn't have the cash...
but she offered to sell her condo, move in with Will.
Move into his motor home?
Which-- you know...
We can't let her do.
For his sake as much as hers.
Well, I, uh-- I made a call
today as well to the IRS,
and, um...
they said that they would stay the lien on the home
if we could come up with $2,000 a month.
Okay, so we could work nights and weekends.
Seven days a week.
Just to never see the kids or each other...
just to pay for a house that...
wouldn't feel like a home 'cause we're never there.
So I guess we'll call the real estate agent?
First we need to talk to the kids.
Yeah.
Okay, Mason. So...
The blanket is an island...
and the rest of the floor is the ocean.
So you don't want to fall off the blanket,
or else you'll fall in the water and drown.
Right?
Wow, drowning?
Is that like a new parenting technique?
I just-- I really have to practice,
so unless you want to watch him?
No, no, looks like you got it covered.
Oh, um, thank you for putting my, uh...
you know, in my backpack yesterday.
Yeah.
Oh, no, no, no, no. Hey, buddy,
No, no, this isn't a toy.
All right, go back on the island
or else you'll get eaten by the sharks.
All right? Stay there.
Hey.
What's up?
Are you stoned?
Uh, a skunk...
sprayed me.
A stoned skunk.
You're high.
Are you freaking kidding me?
What is wrong with you, jude?
Upstairs, now!
Oh, you need a shower before moms get home and bust your ass.
Hurry up!
Mason?
Mason!
Mason!
No, no, no, no, no. Mason!
Mason, where are you!
In here!
I don't think I've ever seen that
blue eye shadow on you before.
Mariana, could you put that away please?
Sorry, one sec.
I have so much to do on this robot,
I should really be in the lab right now.
Okay, well, this is not gonna take long.
We just want you guys to know first...
that everything is okay.
We're gonna be fine.
Mason, I would like you to sit down now, please.
Good job, buddy.
Um, so what's up then?
We, uh--
we're selling the house.
You're kidding me, right?
Are you serious?
We-- what? Why?
For financial reasons.
What's going on with you? Are you okay?
He bumped his head.
How'd you do that?
I'm fine, it's nothing. I just-- I have a headache.
Ugh, tell me about it!
So we're losing the only home
that we've ever known? Great.
Where are we moving to?
Why do you care?
You don't even live here any more.
Hey, Jesus.
Hey, I've lived here longer than you have!
Oh, yeah, and now you're shacking up with your MILF.
Jesus, hey!
What?
"Mother I'd like to facebook."
Cut it out now.
Wait, are we like broke?
Oh, God, I'm not gonna get into a decent school.
Are we gonna be homeless?
Mariana, listen.
Grandma and grandpa are going through a rough patch,
and since they have money invested in this house,
we-- we need to sell it to pay them back.
We're gonna be fine, you guys.
Okay? We're gonna rent until we can buy a new house.
We're gonna have to live in an apartment?
Mariana, a lot of people live in apartments.
Uh-oh. Okay, you have got to tell Courtney
that she needs to get her son under control.
I can't tell her how to parent her kid.
Someone should. You okay, bud?
Yes.
Okay.
We're gonna go, all right?
What?
Come on, Mason.
Where are you going?
We're gonna go. Say bye, Mason.
Bye.
Bye, buddy.
Mason, bye, buddy.
I can't believe this is happening.
Are we still gonna be able to go to Anchor Beach?
Of course you will go to Anchor Beach, honey.
Now where are you going?
I don't-- I don't feel so good.
Jesus! Oh my god!
Honey, are you okay? What's going on?
Hi, sweetie!
Oh, were you a good boy for Brandon?
Yeah.
Was he?
Yeah.
Uh, yeah, yeah.
He was pretty good, except he got into my mom's makeup.
What? How did that happen?
Weren't you watching him?
Well, I was, but it turns out
playing Chopin's Etude Number 10
while watching a toddler is harder than you think.
Great, like your moms need another reason to hate me.
They don't hate you.
Mason, damm it!
No, no, no, no!
How many times do I have to have to tell you?
Hands off the keyboard!
This is not a toy!
Okay, Brandon, it was an accident.
No, he needs a time out, Cort!
Hey, don't yell at my son!
It's not your place to discipline him!
Well, somebody needs to.
I discipline him.
No, you don't! You let him run wild!
You don't set any boundaries!
Okay, that's why he's in our bed every night,
and that's why he ruins our stuff.
He's out of control!
Great.
It's good to know what you think of me as a mother.
Cort.
It's time for bed.
What's taking so long?
I don't know.
Do you think he's gonna be okay?
I mean, he's gonna be okay, right?
I'm sure it's nothing serious.
He probably just forgot to eat lunch or something.
Are you all right?
Just, I still have this freaking headache.
Maybe it's empathy pain.
You know, like twin-tuition.
What? It's a thing.
No, it's not that.
I took some of Jesus's ADHD pills.
Why?
To stay up, to stay focused.
That's like taking speed. Are you crazy?
I'm just so stressed out about the competition.
You don't need to take pills.
You're brilliant, Okay?
And we've got this.
And the whole point of the competition
is to have fun and to learn something,
not... to be an idiot.
I know.
Promise me you won't take any more.
I won't. I promise.
It was stupid.
Hey, is he okay? What happened?
We're not sure. Apparently he hit his head
earlier in the afternoon,
and then just collapsed after you left.
They just took him for a CAT-scan.
We're just waiting to hear.
Mrs. Foster?
Did you find anything?
We did.
Something pretty surprising.
What is that?
That's a...
Nail.
As you can see,
it's embedded several inches into his frontal lobe.
Oh my god.
What?
First of all, it's not life-threatening,
and we're lucky it didn't reach his motor cortex.
So he's gonna be okay?
There is a slight chance this could affect his speech center.
We won't know until we remove it.
How-- how did this happen?
Well, has he been using a nail gun?
N-- has he?
No, not on the robot.
Um, he told me that he was working on your garage,
and that the gun recoiled and hit him in the head.
What was he doing working on the garage?
I think he was, um,
covering for his birth father.
Why-- why wouldn't he say something?
The skull has pain-sensitive nerves,
but there aren't any within the brain itself,
so he probably didn't realize
he did anything more than nick himself.
Okay, is he awake?
Is he aware of what's happening?
We have him sedated and we're prepping him for surgery,
and Dr. Wong, our top neurosurgeon, is on her way,
so your son will be in the best hands possible.
Can we see him?
Uh, yes, but just the moms for now.
It's going to be okay.
Okay, don't worry.
Jesus'll be okay.
It's gonna be all right.
Hey, Ana called me about Jesus.
What happened? Is he all right?
No, he's not.
He shot himself in the head with your nail gun.
What?
He's got a nail in his head
because you didn't show up to do your job.
Look, I'm sorry, I've been sick. I didn't--
Just go...
before my moms see you.
I'm-- I'm really sorry.
Yeah, well, if he's not okay, it's on you.
So is this something you do now?
You get high?
I don't want to talk about it.
Fine, you can talk to moms.
All right, fine.
It's the first time I've smoked it,
but... I ate some gummy worms before--
Well, like, edibles.
Where'd you get them?
I'm not kidding. I'll tell them.
All right! God!
Noah has a medical marijuana card.
Don't lie to me, Jude.
I swear. His mom got it for him for anxiety.
What kind of mom gives their 15-year-old kid pot?
I don't think it's any worse than giving him a bunch of pills.
Oh my god.
Look, people use it for attention problems,
like Jesus.
You don't judge him for taking his meds, do you?
No, that is--
At least weed is natural.
Okay, well, let's be real.
People use it sometimes as an excuse to get high.
Well, it helped me.
I was a little anxious before my test the other day,
so I took some.
And guess what? I got an "A."
Seriously, you're getting high at school?
Don't be an idiot, Jude!
Look, if I find out that you've done it again,
I will go straight to moms, and I'm not kidding.
Hey, any word yet?
No, he's still in surgery.
Thanks for coming, Mike.
Yeah, of course.
You get a chance to talk to Cortney?
Uh, yeah.
Well, what'd she have to say?
Uh, let's talk about it later.
Who's that?
It's Aaron.
Should I be worried about this guy?
No, we're texting about Kyle.
The JJC's not taking his case.
What about the report that said the killer was right-handed?
They said it's not enough.
He just can't catch a break.
You know, and what's so unfair is that he has an alibi witness
who would get him out if he just told the truth.
I love how much you care about people, Callie,
but maybe this time, you ought to just--
What? Give up?
No, and let Kyle go to a maximum-security prison,
where he'll be beaten and raped
and treated like a piece of garbage for the rest of his life?
I didn't mean it like that.
No, I know.
Um, I'm gonna use the restroom, okay?
Hey, so, uh, I've been thinking.
I'm not really comfortable with you and Callie
being intimate under my roof.
Oh, well, okay.
'kay.
Callie!
Hey.
Noah, hey.
How's Jesus?
Still in surgery.
Oh, and this is my mom. Nicole.
I'm one of the volunteer chaplains at the hospital,
so we just wanted to come by and see
if there's anything we can do for you and your family.
Yeah, there is.
Um, look, it's your business
if you want to buy pot for your son,
But I don't want him giving any more of it to my brother.
Did you?
Just once.
I'm sorry.
Maybe it is better if we just go.
Maybe it is, yeah.
Hey.
My love, how you doing?
Jueves cheeseburger, para hermana y...
Private taco.
What, baby?
Psych!
What? Come on.
Jesus, stop.
Jesus.
Well, that's too bad,
You know, because it would've been nice to live in a world
without your awful jokes.
Ha. Hey, it's a good look for you.
So they went up your nose and into your brain?
Meh, it probably wasn't too hard.
There's a lot of extra space up there.
Are you in pain?
No, no, it's not bad.
Mm-hmm, well, by the way,
you are banned from using power tools
for the rest of your natural life.
Oh, and you totally don't deserve to here this,
But Emma told me to tell you
Quote, "She's done thinking about it,
and the answer is 'yes.'"
I don't think I want to know.
So the realtor wants to talk about the listing price.
Are you seriously on your phone right now?
You told Noah's mom what we did?
No, I told Noah not to give you any more gummy worms
and his mother happened to be there.
After all the stupid stuff that you've done
and I've never told anybody,
You go and tattle on me?
You know what? I'm never gonna tell you anything again.
So just stay out of my life... For good.
Hey, everybody, come here, come here.
I know that we're all upset about the house...
But it doesn't matter where we live.
Home is-- it's just where we're all together.
Yes?
You kind of sound like a greeting card.
What are you doing?
My job.
Your job is gonna be someone who can keep his commitments,
not put my son in harms way.
Look, I feel terrible Jesus got hurt.
Okay, but you have to know
that I did not ask him to come in here
and work for me. I would never do that.
It doesn't change the fact that he did
because you weren't here, Gabe.
I don't mean to keep letting him down, and...
I am appreciative
of everything you've done for me.
It certainly doesn't seem that way,
the way you've been acting.
What do you want? I'm struggling here.
With what? What is wrong with you?
What's going on?
I-- I don't know what the problem is.
I don't know what's wrong with me.
Have you really been sick, Gabe?
Really?
I just--
I'm really having a hard time, you know...
Even getting out of bed in the morning.
Sounds like depression to me, don't you think?
Yeah, I guess, but it's not your problem.
Look, peace, okay?
Can we just-- just talk to me.
It's stupid for men to feel this way.
If you don't do anything about it
because you think it's stupid, it's never gonna get better, is it?
I thought...
That when I got off that list that everything would be normal.
But all I can think about is how much of my life
was wasted...
And how I'm never gonna get any of that time back.
Yeah, you won't, that sucks.
Now the only thing you can do is get help,
make sure that you don't lose any more.
I really...
Need to finish this.
Okay.
Thank you.
How are you?
Good.
Excuse me, Mr. Molloy.
Sorry to bother you again.
I already told you, okay? I don't remember.
Look, I know that's not true.
I know that you remember that Kyle was at the rec center
the day that Mrs. Johnson was killed
Because you talked to his lawyer.
Look, uh, it was four years ago.
Right, I don't remember what I had for breakfast today,
so-- what can I get you?
Look, an innocent 17-year-old kid
is gonna spend the rest of his life in prison
if you don't tell the truth.
You need to leave me alone.
Okay? I've got work to do.
My mom's a cop.
We know that you were arrested right before Kyle's trial...
for lewd and lascivious acts with a minor!
You need to get the hell out of here.
And we know you made a deal.
I said get the hell away from me, bitch!
Hey! Do not touch me!
What is going on?
Are you the manager?
Yes!
Okay, you should know that you're employing a child molester!
I don't know who this crazy bitch is.
She just came up to me, started screaming.
Right, you need to leave.
How can you live with yourself?
No, seriously, how?
Do I need to call the cops?
No, I'm going.
You should know this isn't over.
Why don't you take your break?
Hey, it's Molloy again.
That girl I told you about, she came back,
and she knows about the deal we made.
How?
I don't know.
She says her mom's a cop.
What the hell is going on?
Beats me.
What's her name again?
Callie Adams-Foster.
Alright, I'll handle it.
I'd love the opportunity to be your realtor.
