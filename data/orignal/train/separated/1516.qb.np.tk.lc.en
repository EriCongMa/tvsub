we &apos;re back !
funniest thing --
stella fell in love with this dog on our walk ,
just stared at it lovingly .
turned out to be her reflection in a hubcap .
can you blame her ?
i got an &quot; a &quot; on my history exam , by the way .
really , you &apos;re competing with the dog ?
don &apos;t let it bother you , girl .
jay , we need to talk .
i went to an allergist today ,
and he thinks that joe &apos;s rash is an allergy .
what a surprise -- an allergist found an allergy .
he thinks he might be allergic to stella .
what ?
the only reaction this dog gives people is the giggles .
i mean , when she tried to lick her own face ...
in my village , if a goat acted that dumb ,
we wouldn &apos;t even eat it .
this allergy thing is very serious .
we need to separate them for a week
to see if the rash goes away .
i don &apos;t know if i can go that long without seeing joe .
not joe ! the dog !
i already called mitch and cameron .
they &apos;re gonna take her .
for a week ? !
she &apos;ll be traumatized ! she &apos;s very sensitive !
she scrapes her butt on the driveway .
why don &apos;t you like her ?
she &apos;s never done anything to you .
ay , look ! my face cream !
do you know how much this costs ?
no . how much ?
don &apos;t change the subject !
the dog goes now !
you know , now that i think about it ,
i could be allergic to stella .
i &apos;ve been a little stuffy since we got her .
you were stuffy long before stella .
do you not remember scolding that waiter at chuck e. cheese
for serving you from the right ?
victorian .
modern .
craftsman .
spanish .
european ... gothic ?
andy , it &apos;s the castle from &quot; frozen . &quot;
i &apos;m sorry , but you &apos;re not ready .
what ?
to hear that you &apos;re ready !
congratulations , assistant !
i &apos;m moving you up to the next level .
holy cow .
that was an emotional thrill ride .
this sunday ,
you are manning the open house of the cope cod on linden .
that means you &apos;re gonna be sticking
the sign and the balloons on the corner ,
you &apos;re gonna be turning on all the lights ,
you &apos;re gonna be baking all the brownies .
i will make you proud , sir .
what else are you gonna do ?
i will make sure people sign in .
what else ?
when i show someone the master bedroom ,
i &apos;ll say , &quot; this is where the magic happens . &quot;
i &apos;m sold !
yes !
hey , buddy . i got to hit the mall a little later .
you wanna grab a couple of chair massages
till they kick us out ?
nah . i &apos;m gonna go hang out with some of my friends .
okay .
have fun .
teenagers , huh ?
yeah , it &apos;s been happening more and more ,
but it &apos;s natural .
kids that age want distance .
one day , they &apos;re holding your hand so tight it hurts .
the next day , they &apos;re eating the apple you kind of wanted .
not me .
i never turned down an offer to hang with my dad .
luckily for him , he died before my rebellious teenage years .
that must be grandpa with stella .
remember , lily , she &apos;s only gonna be here for a week ,
she &apos;s not gonna be our permanent pet .
don &apos;t tell me , tell larry .
he &apos;s been acting jealous all day .
you &apos;re being crazy !
hey , dad .
hey , jay.there &apos;s our precious little houseguest .
okay , guys , listen up .
she gets three walks a day .
keep her off the bed . we &apos;re training her .
no chicken bones . if she starts to wheeze --
remember when you dropped me off at summer camp ?
you barely slowed down the car .
you never had a condition that made it difficult to breathe .
i was a closeted gay kid at sports camp .
i spent the week in mid @-@ faint .
lily , don &apos;t forget to give stella lots of belly rubs .
grandpa , this is coming
at a really bad time for me and larry .
okay , well , now , don &apos;t you worry
about wily not woving you yet .
aw , who &apos;s the little weeble wobble ?
i can &apos;t watch this . okay .
bye , dad .
oh , i don &apos;t know . i guess in my free time ,
i like to keep up with the latest discoveries
in renewable energy .
just think , a few more months
and you &apos;ll never have to deal with this again .
you know , i don &apos;t mind college interviews .
i actually like discussing the things that they --
i was talking to the mirror .
i know all you had to do to get in your college
was like their facebook page ,
but this is princeton .
i have to show them that i &apos;m a serious thinker ,
and you could be a bit more supportive .
you &apos;re right . i &apos;m sorry .
your outfit &apos;s perfect .
thanks .
if you &apos;re applying to lumberjack school .
and majoring in having your cats eat you when you die .
well , hello .
how was your first day back in the closet ...
business ?
that doesn &apos;t make any sense . i &apos;ve never worked here before .
it &apos;s just a gay joke , mitchell .
don &apos;t overthink it .
you settling in ?
yeah . yeah .
i mean , you know , i &apos;m in jeans and i &apos;m at work --
i feel like a mechanic .
i am looking forward
to doing a few days of freelance legal work for my dad
because , uh , where i work ,
i &apos;ve gotten the unfair reputation
of being the office nag , which is ...
see , it &apos;s only because i work with a bunch of slobs .
i mean , i must tell these people 50 times a day --
&quot; wipe down the microwave , &quot; &quot; clean the coffee pot , &quot;
&quot; whose moldy lunch meat is this , kevin ? &quot;
so , did they put up much of a fight
when you asked for that time off , or ... ?
yeah , it &apos;s so nice and casual here .
i can &apos;t wait to get my chill on .
what are you doing ?
what ? this is me .
no , it &apos;s not .
for the next few days it is .
when i leave here ,
men will want to be me , women will want to shop with me .
have you ever thought of
trying to be nicer at your regular job ?
i mean , i &apos;ve had to learn
how to balance being a friend and a manager .
you could call it being a &quot; franager . &quot;
but i don &apos;t have to , right ?
yes , you do .
i am your boss . you have to do everything i say .
okay , all right , here comes lucy .
she &apos;s new , and dad wants me to talk to her
about the way she dresses .
he says it &apos;s distracting .
watch and learn . lucy &apos;s about to get franaged .
oh , good , it &apos;s a verb , too .
hey , luce .
oh , hi , ms. dunphy .
oh , no , come on . please , my dad is ms. dunphy .
i &apos;m just claire .
so , listen , if you were looking for some clothes for work ,
nordstrom &apos;s having a fabulous sale .
i picked up this appropriate little number there .
well , i &apos;ll have to check that out .
great .
thanks .
see what i just did there ?
i got to get back to work .
do you want to have lunch later ?
aren &apos;t you going to the pasta factory with the gang ?
oh , is it somebody &apos;s birthday ?
i @-@ i don &apos;t know .
uh , something they do on mondays .
oh , right , yeah , yeah . uh , p @-@ pasta factory monday .
i knew that .
doesn &apos;t seem like you did .
break time &apos;s over . get your work done .
looks like someone has an issue with anger franagement .
let &apos; er rip !
what a cannon !
58 miles per hour .
wait . what ? !
yes !
what are you guys doing ?
when we were at the mall ,
we got this baseball shows you how fast you throw it .
you guys went to the mall together ?
yes , we sure did .
and we got the free portrait at sears to prove it .
we should scan that bad boy before it gets ruined .
um ... bye ?
you &apos;re outta there !
milady , for you .
looking good there , haircut !
ah , there he is ! there &apos;s my karaoke partner .
hey , listen , next time you &apos;re ebony , i &apos;m ivory , all right ?
two days down , one to go ,
and everybody in the office still loves the new me .
go ahead , leave a dirty coffee filter .
oh , park askew .
laid @-@ back mitchell doesn &apos;t mind .
you know , it is really nice
to be liked for who you really are pretending to be .
all right .
i &apos;m gonna see you tonight at ronna &apos;s party , right ?
okay . what party ?
aw , the two saddest words in the english language .
nah , it &apos;s no big deal .
we &apos;re just stopping by a bar after work ,
have some beer , some hot wings .
look at me .
no , it &apos;s cool .
this is my fault .
when i first started here ,
somebody asked me to do something and i said no ,
and now they think i &apos;m not interested .
yeah , that &apos;s probably it .
i might drop by this one , though .
i think people would appreciate it .
no , you can &apos;t go .
what ? why not ?
well , you know how y @-@ you think
that you &apos;re their boss and their friend ?
you &apos;re one of those things .
oh , my god . they hate me .
no . lots of people like you .
like who ?
uh , well , me . i do .
yeah ?
and , um , the , uh ...
dad . dad &apos;s a big fan .
how &apos;s my little angel ?
not great today .
i &apos;m settling in .
not you two -- stella .
oh , she &apos;s fine .
cam &apos;s taking great care of her .
is she getting enough walks ?
cam comes home from work at lunch ,
takes her right to the dog park .
in fact , he &apos;s there with her right now .
not the one on barrington .
&apos;cause there &apos;s an unsnipped chow
always tries to hump her silly .
oh , hi , mr. pritchett .
hey , lucy .
lucy likes you .
hey , claire , check out my new shirt .
i have you to thank .
oh , no , that &apos;s all you .
you were supposed to talk to her
about storing those zeppelins in a hangar .
i did !
well , do it again . louder . this is a place of business .
she needs to throw a tarp over those bounce houses .
dad , i think you &apos;re the one who &apos;s being offensive .
it &apos;s my company . take care of it .
hello ?
what dog park are you at ?
good afternoon to you , too , jay .
stella and i are at rancho .
thank god .
keep your eye out for randy chows .
the figure skater ?
just keep stella &apos;s safe .
jay , she &apos;s fine . she &apos;s having a great time .
h @-@ here , i &apos;m gonna send you
a hilarious picture i just took of her .
she &apos;s never looked happier .
probably just being polite .
what the hell am i looking at ?
oh , god , w @-@ what -- what did i send you ?
what &apos;s that thing around her neck ?
uh , that is just a new collar .
her old one was looking a little tattered .
don &apos;t go buying her presents !
she &apos;s still my dog .
you &apos;re a glorified kennel .
it &apos;s just a fun little collar that i bejeweled .
what &apos;s next ? you gonna dress her in fishnets ,
put her in a window in amsterdam ?
just keep it casual !
oh , my god . you &apos;re such a slut .
oh , i love it .
nothing , i &apos;m just taking my sister
to a college interview at a coffee shop .
i know , right ?
oh , i totally forgot to tell you what happened last night .
lisa , enzo , and i were at a bar in echo park ,
and enzo was like ,
&quot; my dream is to run the bases at dodger stadium . &quot;
so i &apos;m like , &quot; screw it , let &apos;s do it . &quot;
so , lisa tucks her hair up to a baseball cap ,
and we convince the grounds keeper that she &apos;s justin bieber
and that &quot; justin &quot; will take a picture with him .
and it worked !
no , you shut up ! that &apos;s not even the best part .
enzo starts running the bases ,
and he whips his shirt off .
and lisa gets caught up in it and takes off her shirt ,
and the grounds keeper &apos;s like ,
&quot; whoa , you &apos;re not justin bieber . &quot;
so he starts chasing us around with a rake .
i know !
oh , wait . who is that ?
denise ? put that dirty hooker on the phone .
hey , girl . did i tell you what happened last night ?
so , enzo said that his dream
was to run the bases at dodger stadium ,
and i was like , &quot; screw it , let &apos;s do it . &quot;
oh , my god !
do you ever stop talking ? !
i am sitting here trying to mentally prepare
for one of the most important moments of my life ,
so can you please just shut up ?
i know , right ?
all right , looks like they &apos;re finishing up .
i should probably go in now .
ooh , tell her cute dress -- nanette lepore , fall collection .
great . i &apos;ll open with , &quot; cute dress . &quot;
cute dress .
andy , 36 hours to the open house .
you ready ?
i was born ready .
actually , that &apos;s not true .
i was two months premature ,
weighed three and a half pounds .
i &apos;m a little nervous .
there &apos;s only one way to get over that --
mock open house !
starting in five ... four ...
uh , business card !
you &apos;re not andy .
sorry to disappoint you .
i &apos;m here !
welcome . come on in .
thank you .
what &apos;s happening ?
i was about to give mr. dunphy here
a tour of this beautiful open house .
i do not know who mr. dunphy is , although he sounds cool .
i &apos;m just a handsome plastic surgeon relocating from tucson .
and i &apos;m his son .
good idea . pretend to be my son .
so , is this the kitchen ?
great question . yes , it is .
fully updated with an open floor plan ,
perfect for large families .
do you and the missus have other kids ?
nope , just me , so it &apos;s way too big .
you seem terrible at your job .
i don &apos;t know .
you seem like a family with a lot of friends .
it &apos;s great for entertaining .
how diverse is the neighborhood ?
i only ask because i &apos;m married
to a beautiful african @-@ american woman .
i can &apos;t say who ,
but you may know her from &quot; avatar . &quot;
this neighborhood has a wonderful mix
of different cultures and ethnicities .
ooh , sounds dangerous .
luke ...
here &apos;s all you need to know --
in the last two years , home values in this neighborhood
have increased by twice the city average .
it &apos;s quiet . it &apos;s safe .
i can &apos;t think of a better place
to raise a beautiful mixed @-@ race family .
i &apos;m gonna have to have a quick conversation with zoe ,
but i think you just sold a house .
yes !
good . is this finally done ?
&apos;cause , dad , i was thinking maybe you and i
could put on tuxedos and test @-@ drive rolls @-@ royces .
aw , luke , i &apos;m sorry . i wish i could ,
but i already promised andy i &apos;d teach him how to tie a tie .
come on , buddy . i got a song and everything .
i have to let you know ,
my neck is extraordinarily ticklish .
you don &apos;t say .
don &apos;t you dare .
don &apos;t . don &apos;t !
get over here !
no ! no , no , no , no , no , no , no !
it was so nice to meet you , gita .
i &apos;ll be sure to send you that recording of my bassoon solo .
you &apos;d better !
could you kill me over the phone ?
oh , my god . these kids are all the same .
please tell me
we weren &apos;t this aggressively boring when we applied .
it &apos;s all debate team , orchestra , a.p. , gpa .
i wanted to smack one of them in her smug little face ,
but i &apos;m pretty sure she was a robot .
i can &apos;t believe i &apos;m missing spinning for this .
hi . i &apos;m alex dunphy .
i got to go .
oh , great . have a seat . i &apos;m vanessa .
would you like some coffee ?
no , thanks , but i actually have a crazy fact about coffee --
bees love caffeine because it &apos;s found in nectar ,
but i don &apos;t know that much about b &apos;s ,
as you can see from my transcript .
so , i see here that you &apos;re on the debate team
and you play the cello .
yes , but i am so much more than that .
i &apos;m also a part of the french club .
tell me more .
i &apos;m so sorry for wasting your time .
this was a big mistake .
i &apos;m probably not princeton material anyways .
i mean , i spent most of last night
in the back of a squad car .
wait , what ?
well , crazy story --
my friend enzo &apos;s dream
was to run the bases at dodger stadium .
and i was just like , &quot; screw it , let &apos;s do it . &quot;
oh , by the way , cute dress .
is that a nanette lepore ?
oh , my god , yes . good eye .
so , what happened next ?
well , then my friend lisa
tucks her hair up into a baseball cap ,
and we convince the grounds keeper that she &apos;s justin bieber
and that &quot; justin &quot; will take a picture with him .
oh , my god .
you &apos;re so naughty . i love it .
you know it , slut .
oh , my god . i am so sorry .
aww , you &apos;re cooking us a steak dinner -- how sweet .
yeah , i came home from work early to cook us dinner .
that &apos;s crazy .
this is for stella .
ay , jay ...
you don &apos;t know what i &apos;m competing with over there .
cameron &apos;s wooing her with belly rubs ,
jewelry , kisses on the mouth .
i just want her to remember who loves her the most .
i don &apos;t think stella is ever going to forget
how much you love her ,
no matter how much time
she needs to stay with mitch and cam .
what are you talking about ? she &apos;s coming home friday .
that &apos;s the thing .
look .
the rash is gone .
well , we don &apos;t know that &apos;s stella .
a lot of things cause rashes .
maybe he &apos;s less stressed this week than last .
what &apos;s going on ?
we have to get rid of stella .
slow down . we haven &apos;t decided anything yet .
yes , we have . it &apos;s what &apos;s best for joe .
and for whatever it &apos;s worth , my eyes have stopped itching ,
i can taste my food , and i have more energy .
you took a three @-@ hour nap yesterday .
i was tired from the marathon .
the &quot; downton abbey &quot; marathon ?
that family is exhausting .
i can &apos;t believe this .
ah , jay , i &apos;m so sorry .
maybe you can get a fish !
&apos;cause it &apos;s so much cuter driving down the road
with your fish &apos;s head sticking out the window .
fish !
oh , my god .
are you here for another lecture ?
because you made your point loud and clear .
i &apos;m keeping it casual .
i haven &apos;t even looked at stella this morning .
okay , do not read too much into that --
i just took that off one of lily &apos;s teddy bears .
it &apos;s fine .
i &apos;m glad you guys are spoiling her ,
because i won &apos;t be able to anymore .
joe &apos;s allergic .
no .
yeah , and i figured since she likes you so much ,
maybe you guys could keep her .
well , i mean , if that &apos;s what &apos;s best for everyone .
maybe you better check with mitch first ?
he &apos;ll deal .
i made her a steak .
okay .
and this is her daybed .
i guess i better say goodbye .
hi , sweetie .
come here . i want to talk to you .
now , honey ,
you &apos;re gonna live here from now on .
don &apos;t give me that look .
it wasn &apos;t anything you did .
you &apos;ve been the best dog i could ever have asked for ,
and i love you very much . so ...
stay away from cars ...
don &apos;t eat anything pointy ...
and be a good girl .
goodbye , stella @-@ bella .
i didn &apos;t think i &apos;d get through that without crying .
me neither .
hey , dad , check out this video .
it &apos;s a teacup pig playing a piano .
i saw that . andy sent it to me .
unbelievable .
that &apos;s what i thought ,
but then andy and i did some digging .
it turns out pigs are crazy musical .
good ol &apos; andy .
is something up , buddy ?
i said &quot; no &quot; one time .
and suddenly it &apos;s all &quot; andy this &quot; and &quot; andy that . &quot;
well , i didn &apos;t mean anything by it .
it just seemed like you needed some space ,
so i gave it to you .
i get it .
you &apos;re at that age when you want to separate .
yeah , i separate from you ,
not the other way around .
maybe i don &apos;t want to do dumb stuff with you all the time ,
but
that doesn &apos;t mean you get to replace me .
what ?
are you kidding me ? i could never replace you .
if it were up to me , we &apos;d do everything together .
really ?
yeah , i &apos;d go to college with you .
we &apos;d @-@ we &apos;d be roommates . we &apos;d try to join a frat .
none of them would take us .
we &apos;d start our own .
oh , my god . that sounds amazing .
why wouldn &apos;t they take us ?
well , yeah , they &apos;d take me , but i &apos;d be like ,
&quot; no way , bradley ,
not without my little pal , here . &quot;
i have mixed feelings about that , dad .
do you have mixed feelings about a hug ?
yes .
well , i need one , so i guess i &apos;m gonna go hug andy .
fine .
hey , judy , that was a hilarious e @-@ mail .
pickles are better than men .
did you get that ? it was so--
have you done any work since you came here ?
i &apos;m working the room .
there he is . sport coat .
sport coat ?
i can &apos;t believe these idiots think you &apos;re funny .
okay . you know , i have a theory
why people here don &apos;t like you .
i know why they don &apos;t like me .
it &apos;s cause dad makes me do all his dirty work .
look at this list of people i &apos;m supposed to reprimand today .
let &apos;s see here .
well , he does have a point , glen does smell .
i &apos;m gonna start with lucy .
lucy , the last person who likes me .
oh , it &apos;s okay .
hey , luce .
hey , claire . i got you one of those cookies that you like .
oh , don &apos;t make this harder than it has to be .
is there something wrong ?
yes .
it &apos;s not easy for me to discuss , but--
claire , i got this .
it &apos;s my complaint . i got it .
lucy ...
you &apos;re at work , so please dress like it .
these &quot; tops &quot; that you wear are completely inappropriate .
sorry to offend you .
you know what ?
while i &apos;m at it , glen , shower more often .
chuck , stop using &quot; reply all . &quot;
a @-@ and , doris , no one cares
about what you dreamt about last night .
let &apos;s keep in mind this is a place of business , folks ,
all right ?
this feels good .
is there a carl ? !
lawyers .
am i right , sport coat ?
that &apos;s not sport coat .
i &apos;m home .
oh , hi . how are you feeling ?
i &apos;ll be fine .
oh , jay , i &apos;m so proud of you .
you made a sacrifice today .
you did the right thing for your son .
look how happy he is .
i guess .
wait a minute .
what &apos;s that on his neck ?
what ?
his rash came back .
no .
you must have some stella on you .
no , no , i went to straight to the club after .
took a shower , maybe cried a little bit in there ,
changed clothes to make sure .
plus , i just got here .
a rash would take longer to come out .
what &apos;s that smell ?
what smell ?
it smells like flowers or something .
i didn &apos;t get any flowers .
i smell something , gloria .
what &apos;s new around here ?
the fact that you noticed something .
it &apos;s you .
what &apos;s new ? what ?
perfume , lipstick ?
i &apos;m getting lavender with ,
i want to say rose hips .
it &apos;s your face cream !
i did buy some more this morning , but--
the same kind that stella was eating
before joe &apos;s rash cleared up ?
and now you &apos;re wearing it again , and his rash is back ?
no , it can &apos;t be my face cream !
please don &apos;t make me say goodbye to my face cream !
stella was eating it to save joe !
but that still doesn &apos;t explain
why i &apos;m still feeling so much better .
i can breathe for th--
stella &apos;s coming home a hero !
lily , can you come out here , please ?
why do we have to do this ?
because she &apos;s become attached , jay .
she &apos;s even sleeping with her now .
hi , grandpa .
hi , honey .
lily , do you remember how i said
stella was gonna be staying with us from now on ?
well , it turns out ...
she &apos;s gonna go home with grandpa .
okay .
lily , it &apos;s important to express your feelings .
don &apos;t bottle them up .
okay . i can finally sleep without all of her snoring !
all right , enough . hand her over .
come here , baby .
what is that ?
please don &apos;t make fun of me . i &apos;m very vulnerable right now .
can you get me one ?
