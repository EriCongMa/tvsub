something &apos;s happened .
it was totally an accident .
not a big deal . i just want to do
the mature thing and come clean about it .
but , um ,
i accidentally saw nick &apos;s pee @-@ pee .

what &apos;d she say ?
i accidentally saw nick &apos;s pee @-@ pee
and his bubbles .
but it &apos;s not a big deal .
ain &apos;t no thing .
ain &apos;t no thaaang .
oh , nick , hey .
so , that was weird , right ?
i &apos;m running out the door , jess .
i think we should talk about it .

the peen what i saw .
bonjour , le peen .
you &apos;re blocking the door .
okay . cool .

tell that guy to behave .
the adventure begins .
okay . excuse me , jess .
that was so horrible .
what am i gonna do ?
he &apos;s never gonna speak to me again . i &apos;m so embarrassed .
it &apos;s not a big deal .
i &apos;ve seen nick &apos;s stuff , like , a million times .
you have ?
i mean ... how ?
we grew up together .
locker rooms , swimming pools ,
penis fights-- it just happens .
why haven &apos;t i seen it ?
why do you want to see it ?
he &apos;s my best friend .
again , why do you want to see it ?
what if nick gets into an accident ?
what if he &apos;s horribly disfigured ,
and i have to identify him ,
and all that remains are his private parts ?
and i &apos;m standing there and i &apos;m saying ,
&quot; sorry , officer , i can &apos;t help you ,
because no , i haven &apos;t seen his penis . &quot;
and then boom , he &apos;s buried in an unmarked grave .
again , why do you want to see it ?
what did it look like ?
what do you mean ?
just say when .
just sa ... serious ...
seriously ? are you se ... are you serious ?
okay , you know what . this is impossible .
i &apos;m starting over .
schmidt , i need your help .
okay ... all right , jess , fine .
what happened after you walked in ?
i don &apos;t know . i kind of laughed .
jess , you can &apos;t laugh at a naked man ,
especially nick .
nick is delicate ...
like a flower .
like a chubby , damaged flower who hates himself .
now , listen to me . you &apos;re gonna act
like this never happened .
we live together .
we &apos;re a family .
families talk about things .
no . families ignore things until they go away .
hey , mom , hey , mom , hey , mom ,
i &apos;m a bunny , mom. mom !
mom , mom , mom ,
i &apos;m a bunny , mom. mom !
no one wants to talk about their feelings , jess .
never talk about this again .
okay . i &apos;ll ignore it .
not gonna talk about ...
or sing about it .
... the bing @-@ bong . i &apos;m done .
this is my ... my chambre .
what does that mean ?
you &apos;re a good kisser .
can we , can we be serious ? do you mind just being serious ?
i &apos;m gonna get serious-- on your face .
i have no idea what that means .
actually , let &apos;s not laugh when you &apos;re near my penis .
take it off .
here , just take your shirt off .
here . do ...
do you want me to go first ?
you &apos;re offering just to take your ...
oh , my god !
look at you .
take off your clothes now .
president obama .
yeah , i like him to watch over me .
do you , like , want to take it slow ... or something ?
this is nice .
yeah .
hi , nick .
so i guess your date went well .
sleepover party .
i have something from school
that , um ... made me think of you .
it &apos;s a feeling stick .
whoever &apos;s holding a feeling stick
has permission to say whatever he or she is feeling
without being judged .
i &apos;ll go first . um ...
i feel like i want to know what you &apos;re feeling .
believe it or not , that &apos;s not the first time
someone &apos;s broken my feeling stick .
i have a travel size .
no .
nick , wait !
nick , we have to talk about this .
what are you doing ?
i &apos;m sorry i saw your doojer and your chickadees .
and i didn &apos;t mean to laugh . i just ...
then why did you laugh ?
is there something funny about it ?
no .
it &apos;s beautiful .
stately .
a real treat .
oh , my god .
i think it &apos;s great you dance naked to jamaican music .
that &apos;s really cool .
you should explore your sexuality .
nick ?
excuse me .
come on , nick . i dance naked all the time .
we have to talk about this .
nick !
nick , please talk to me .
jess , there &apos;s nothing to talk about .
you ruined my date .
every time i tried to take my clothes off , jess ,
i heard your little ...
your little crazy giggle scream .
and all i want to do is have meaningless sex
with a beautiful woman who , yes , talks in mind @-@ bending riddles .
but i can &apos;t ,
because i can &apos;t get your little ...
out of my head .
well , maybe you don &apos;t want to have meaningless sex .
maybe that &apos;s not your style .
i have a bing @-@ bong and chickadees .
it is my style .
stop following me .
then stop running away from me .
i just want to have a mature conversation .
how can we have a mature conversation
when you can &apos;t even say the word &quot; penis &quot; ?
i can say the word &quot; pen ... &quot;
say it .
i ...
&quot; peernyas . &quot;
what ?
&quot; peernis . &quot;
you said &quot; peernis . &quot;
penis .
not singing .
penis .
not like a ghoul .
i ... i can say it !
pianist .
no , you said &quot; pianist . &quot;
enispay !
not pig latin .
&quot; peernis . &quot;
okay , not in swedish .
&quot; pemo . &quot;
not in fake italian .
penis !
shut up !
say it with me-- &quot; pe ...
pe ...
... nis . &quot;
... neers .
yeah , i &apos;m the one that &apos;s immature .
hey , man .
i &apos;m the only one who hasn &apos;t seen it .
what ?
just the gun .
no .
just the roses .
what ?
just the hub , where it connects .
get out .
fine !
i thought we were best friends .
we are .
apparently not .
best friends don &apos;t do this , schimidt .
they do it all the time .
you laughed ?
yeah , i couldn &apos;t help it .
did you freak out and make that noise
that you always make ?
what ? i don &apos;t always make a noise .
fine .
i guess i missed the moment
when everybody got cool about sex .
i really messed up .
ah , guys are simple .
you know what i would do ? i would just make it even .
you &apos;ve seen his ; show him yours .
no .
i can &apos;t do that .
hey , winston .
oh , no . oh , man .
the interview ? did you mess up ?
no , i didn &apos;t mess up .
killed it . i was amazing .
at one point , i was on the outside
of my body watching myself be amazing .
well , that &apos;s a good thing , right ?
the woman asked me
why i wanted to sell medical supplies .
i had no answer .
i &apos;ve done anything but play basketball my entire life .
&quot; winston bishop is an american basketball player
who played professionally in latvia ,
and he loves ducks . &quot;
winston , did you write the part about the ducks ?
i don &apos;t even like ducks that much , man .
okay , look , man .
you got to get off wikipedia , all right ?
you &apos;re going crazy .
i was the guy who was good enough
to play in latvia .
and then one day , i don &apos;t know , man--
i just lost it .
they found another black guy .
means &quot; the better black guy . &quot;
a better melno ?
you &apos;re @-@ you &apos;re the best melno .
i don &apos;t know , man .
i just don &apos;t know what comes next .
you know what you do next ?
come on . you &apos;re gonna get up .
let &apos;s get up . come on , buddy .
we &apos;re gonna get you out of the house .
we &apos;re gonna get you moving . it &apos;s gonna feel good .
whoo ! this feels good .
totally . i love it .
you know , i think i was just scared , man .
i &apos;ve been playing basketball my whole entire life .
what if i was wasting my time ?
maybe i should have been figuring out my life like you .
i don &apos;t have anything figured out .
i &apos;m a fully @-@ grown man with roommates .
i have a stupid job . i &apos;m single .
my best friend won &apos;t even let me see his penis .
i mean , my whole life is a sham .
i actually feel a lot better .
thanks , schimidt .
winston , my legs !
schimidt ?
my legs are seizing up .
schimidt !
i hate my life . i hate my ...
making new discoveries .
i &apos;m a fear @-@ based person , apparently .
stop it . go . i need a ...
give me a hug , please . 911 .
ow . ow .
i &apos;m sorry about last night , amanda .
so you &apos;re ... you &apos;re , like , super into &quot; cuddling . &quot;
no , i &apos;m not super into cuddling .
i &apos;m just getting out of a relationship ,
and i think i got nervous .
i &apos;ve heard that i &apos;m not great at talking
about what i &apos;m feeling all the time ,
and so i &apos;m sorry about last night .
honesty .
i like that .
oh , yeah !
you are so hot !
i can &apos;t believe you &apos;re into me .
okay .
oh whoa , this is happening .
take off your pants . take off your pants !
okay , okay , okay , okay .
take your pants off . yeah ?
you want me to take them off ?
yeah . yeah . take them off .
yeah , take this ... want me to ?
okay . want me to take these off ?
yeah .
okay , lights on , pants off . here we go . okay .
oh , i &apos;m totally cool with this .
yeah . all right .
what are you doing ? !
what is ... ? ! who is that ? !
what are you doing ? !
hi . i &apos;m jess .
welcome to our home .
we live in a world with rules . we knock .
we have doors .
and we knock on those doors .
i &apos;m sorry , nick .
just knock !
nick ... i ...
put that down .
but we have to talk ...
nothing to talk about .
i feel that nick is not honoring the feeling stick .
i feel me , too .
i feel schimidt &apos;s had a particularly bad day ,
and i feel that if nick is truly schimidt &apos;s friend ,
he would show schimidt what &apos;s in his pants .
i feel supported .
what is going on with you two ?
what are you doing ?
i feel nick is yelling .
stop it !
yo . i just wanted to thank you
for taking me running .
made me feel a lot better .
now , i might not have a job or anything ,
but at least i can run a mile .
i mean , watching you try to run , yeah ,
that was just pathetic .
i needed that .
i suffer from exercise @-@ induced asthma .
do you suffer from exercise @-@ induced crying ?
it &apos;s a real thing , man , okay ? eia .
you know what i learned from the internet ?
we got nothing to worry about .
everybody has their moment .
we might get a cat one day .
that cat might play the keyboard .
a bear might fall on our trampoline .
we don &apos;t need to have it figured out right now .
our moments will come .
hey , man .
let &apos;s keep bro &apos;ing out .
come in .
jess , you don &apos;t have to knock
once you &apos;re in the room .
i worked on something for you .
all right .
penis .
very good .
thank you .
um , so did amanda call you back ?
no , i don &apos;t see amanda calling me back .
i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s okay .
maybe you were right .
maybe i &apos;m not ready
for meaningless sex with beautiful women .
well , you know , maybe when you are ,
you &apos;ll be able to show her your other penis .
your heart penis .
get out of my room .
okay .
hey , um ... when i was , um ,
leaving in a hurry ,
um , did you see ...
everything ?
yup .
even my ... my gumbo pot ?
ugh . gumbo pot ? get out .
get out schimidt .
