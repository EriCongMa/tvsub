there ain &apos;t no bear back there .
fellas !
well , the way i feel right now , i &apos;d like to meet a bear .
what would you do if you did meet him ?
that bear would have just as much chance as this pork chop .
where you boys all going ? it ain &apos;t over .
somebody &apos;s going to get something they ain &apos;t expecting .
have a bite .
look out , here he comes !
where &apos;s furio ?
he couldn &apos;t get a flight
out of rome , so i &apos;m driving again today .
come on in , he &apos;ll be right down .
no coffee . i gotta go . okay ?
what did you do to your hair ?
i cut it . what do you think ?
i thought we agreed that you &apos;d talk to me before doing something to your hair .
what do you think of it ?
it &apos;s short .
good , he eats his carrots .
makes you look younger .
benny &apos;s waiting for you .
all right . well , here .
you fat honey dripper . come up with the rest of our money ,
or i &apos;ll strip the lard off your ugly ....
pretty .
cosette ? come on , mommy .
let &apos;s go for a walk .
where &apos;s the dog ?
you shut the tv ?
where &apos;s the dog ?
oh , my god ! cosette .
what ?
christopher !
she &apos;s not breathing . her neck feels broken .
what the fuck ?
oh , my god , she &apos;s dead !
i fell asleep .
what ?
she must &apos;ve crawled under there for warmth .
are you fucking crazy ?
you fucking killed her !
i didn &apos;t kill her . i must have sat on her .
jesus .
my poor baby .
i &apos;m sorry . it was an accident , for christ &apos;s sake .
how long have i said she shouldn &apos;t be on the furniture ?
it &apos;s because you were fucking high , christopher .
you and your fucking smack ! fuck ! lifestyle .
i &apos;ll get you another dog .
i don &apos;t want another dog !
four in the side .
one up the ass .
so nobody &apos;s heard from ralph ?
i &apos;m starting to worry .
i &apos;ll call him again .
try the gay man &apos;s choir .
i read they were having tryouts today .
three ball , far corner .
son of a bitch .
where you been ?
this was in the mail for you outside , tony . ups .
what &apos;s going on ?
he &apos;s calling ralph .
leave a message and leave your phone number .
with my schedule , i cannot look up phone numbers .
answering machine , again .
you &apos;re up , t.
how you doing ? feeling all right ?
me ? yeah , great .
fuck .
what &apos;s that , ton &apos; ?
that &apos;s tony and ralph &apos;s horse , pie @-@ o @-@ my .
where you going ? your shot .
what are you doing ?
that &apos;s a forfeit . that &apos;s our money .
bing .
get rid of that fucking picture .
what ? you don &apos;t want to--
you hear me ? burn it !
i never want to see the fucking thing again !
what ?
what &apos;s with ralph ? fucking bermuda triangle ?
this shit with his kid . he &apos;s probably down in the bunker .
i &apos;ll tell you . if i didn &apos;t know better ....
we &apos;re off the record here , albert .
we &apos;re off the record ?
it &apos;s tony .
what ? am i wrong ?
honestly ? i don &apos;t know .
take a leak .
this is bad , my friend . i mean , don &apos;t get me wrong .
i wouldn &apos;t piss on this ralph if he was on fire .
but to whack the guy over a horse ? how fucked up is that ?
if it can happen to him , it can happen to any of us .
what &apos;s next ? you get clipped for wearing the wrong shoes ?
what can you do ? tony &apos;s the boss . centuries of tradition here .
exactly my point . if tony did do this ... whack ralph over a fucking horse ...
that guy would be the first guy on line to pull his fucking plug .
i think justin recognized me a few minutes ago .
thank you .
come in , he &apos;s getting dressed .
i &apos;ll wait in the car .
well , welcome back .
i bring presents .
really ? that is so sweet .
also , for the grownups , i bring some of my uncle &apos;s wine ... but it &apos;s come later .
i just made some coffee . are you sure ?
thank you , but i wait in the car .
what &apos;s the matter with you ?
i &apos;m sad for my father .
all right , but you gotta get over it .
so i unwrap the paper ... and there she is ...
with her head held high and her ears perked up .
and there i am smiling .
what happened then ?
still , i gotta be the sad clown . a front for my friends , my family .
you know , a brave front .
i &apos;ve heard you describe yourself this way .
the sad clown .
i &apos;ve never seen it .
carmela also painted a very different picture .
what do you mean ?
volatile , punching the walls .
compulsive gorging on food .
kind of a far cry from the seltzer bottle and bicycle horn .
i &apos;m sorry .
maybe you &apos;d like carmela to be here , if i &apos;m so fucking obnoxious .
what i &apos;m trying to establish is your response to sadness ...
is usually rage , not humor .
you two don &apos;t have to trouble yourselves .
because i doubled my dosage .
i don &apos;t want you taking 80 milligrams of prozac .
you kick it up to 80 for a week , 10 days ...
just to pull back on the stick , get the nose up ...
then you duck back down to 40 before the limp dick thing sets in .
one : that &apos;s ineffective .
two : it &apos;s not a treatment for grief .
let &apos;s get back to pie @-@ o @-@ my .
it &apos;s sad that you &apos;ve lost something that you love .
that being said ... it is a horse .
what the fuck is the matter with you ?
the only other time you &apos;ve become this emotional in here ...
it was those ducks .
that was a whole different thing . they were ducks .
is it different ? you haven &apos;t grieved in this way for people .
your mother , your best friend .
can &apos;t i just be sad for a horse without some touchy @-@ feely ...
freudian shit component to it ?
when it was the ducks , it embodied feelings of dread ...
about your family , that something terrible was going to happen .
it &apos;s just the miserable way she died .
it just makes me wonder what kind of fucking toilet world we live in .
a friend of the family , little boy ...
gets shot with an arrow , cuts off the flow of blood to his brain .
thirteen years old .
he &apos;s going to live , but he &apos;s never gonna be right .
how awful for the parents .
yeah .
my nephew . i love that kid like i love my son .
but i think he &apos;s got a drug problem , heroin .
it kills me just to say it , because i got so many hopes tied up in this kid .
this is christopher ?
this 9 / 11 shit , i don &apos;t know . the shit that &apos;s going on everywhere .
it &apos;s like some fucking asshole is stalking the human race .
anthony , do any of your associates think about any of this ?
i don &apos;t know , we don &apos;t talk about it .
i know it &apos;s fucking ridiculous ,
but i feel like the reverend rodney king jr . , you know ?
&quot; why can &apos;t we all just get along ? &quot;
what &apos;s ridiculous about it ?
come on , don &apos;t jerk me off .
this is me you &apos;re talking to .
you &apos;ve caused much suffering yourself , haven &apos;t you ?
my wife prays to god .
what kind of god does this shit ?
how about carmine lupertazzi ?
christopher ever talk about a dinner with him and tony last july ?
what &apos;s the matter , adriana ?
you and christopher arguing ?
it &apos;s a stressful time , right before a wedding .
a lot of guys get cold feet .
he &apos;s fucking stoned on h all the time , okay ?
there , you happy ?
we put you guys on the mailing list for hazelden .
that rehab shit ? that &apos;s where all the brochures are coming from ? from you ?
convince him he needs help , that he should be in rehab .
look at you , with that little face .
these flat screens , i &apos;ll tell you , no glare , high definition .
i was watching on the waterfront down at sears .
karl malden &apos;s nose hairs looked like fucking bx cables .
voice mail again .
chrissy , we &apos;re down here waiting for the tvs .
let me ask you something .
the other day , t with that picture ...
he looked like he was going to cry .
still no word from ralph .
where the fuck is this kid ?
what you want around here ?
can you do an eighth of scag ?
$ 500 .
yeah , wrap it up .
get the fuck out the car , bitch !
motherfucker , you know who i am ?
who the fuck is this ?
you know who the fuck i &apos;m with ?
you ain &apos;t no fucking cop , that &apos;s for sure .
the fuck you going to do with that ?
stick it up your mother &apos;s twat !
goddamn it !
what ?
little piece of shit . the cork , it got stuck in the bottle .
homemade crap .
that somebody cared enough
about to carry all the way from the old country for you .
what a fucking week .
i talked to ronnie , asked her if she &apos;s even heard from ralph .
little fucking kid &apos;s got a respiratory infection now .
she just heard about pie @-@ o @-@ my , she &apos;s sick about it .
hello ? we &apos;re talking about justin here .
sorry , i was thinking about my mother , her skin condition .
oh , my god . did i forget to take that out ?
what &apos;s wrong with you ?
really , ma . dad &apos;s right .
it &apos;s not a bad drive . it &apos;s interstate up to boston .
if you don &apos;t want to accompany me , fine .
your sister can come up from florida .
come on , she &apos;s not going to do that .
of course i &apos;ll go .
did she tell you , hugh ? my horse died .
pie @-@ o @-@ my ?
that &apos;s too bad .
god , this wine .
there was a fire at the stables .
she had to be destroyed . you should &apos;ve seen her .
string beans , hugh ?
baby , what happened ?
he got jacked by some spics .
they took his ride , his fucking watch , too .
jesus christ , the cartier ?
christopher , you &apos;re bleeding .
stop touching it .
do you think i could get some money ?
what ?
who are you ?
eddie . from down the park .
he &apos;s good people , adriana .
i took him home . he was all fucked up , but i straightened him out .
he owes me $ 30 .
get the fuck out of here .
what ?
get out of my house .
don &apos;t stiff me on this , man .
get out !
what &apos;s the matter with you ? the guy &apos;s my friend .
that &apos;s your friend ?
hazelden ? what &apos;s this ?

where do you get your balls ?
what are you doing ?
what ? sil said torch it .
a classy piece like this ?
horse with the trees , wooden frame ?
$ 25,000 to $ 30,000 at a minimum .
i think it was tony said he wanted it burnt , paulie , specifically .
put it in my car , i &apos;ll take it home .
all right .
it &apos;d be an honor to hang this picture in my house .
tony , can you come down here , please ?
what &apos;s the matter ?
what happened ?
your nephew .
christopher did this ? he hit you ?
what for ?
what &apos;s the difference ?
he was high .
little prick , i &apos;m going to wring his fucking neck . where is he ?
he &apos;s been using drugs . heroin .
who &apos;s this ?
you called me , maricon .
where &apos;s christopher , asshole ?
fuck your mother .
his car was stolen by some puerto ricans . they took his cell phone , too .
i don &apos;t know what to do .
i already packed a suitcase for my aunt &apos;s in daytona .
take it easy . don &apos;t do something you &apos;ll regret .
three weeks before their wedding .
maybe he needs to be in rehab .
you can hire someone to do an intervention , apparently .
girls , come on . we &apos;re a family here .
now i gotta spell it out for you ?
take it easy . let me figure out how to handle this .
please , don &apos;t hurt him .
at this stage the fight is getting closer because ....
why am i always having to come here ?
how are you doing , man ?
did we come at a bad time ?
the decorating ideas .
you want to come in ?
i &apos;m sorry for the mess .
please , this is nothing .
so , there is a page from metropolitan home .
now , wait till you see how a mirrored backsplash can amplify a room .
you want something ? something to drink ?
we gotta go .
if you &apos;ve got a cup of coffee .
he loved that little man , by the way .
gobbetto .
he &apos;s good luck .
not that he remembered to thank you . and meadow loved that book .
you know , i feel bad . i didn &apos;t give you something .
i bring something , but i forgot it when i left that morning .
balsamic vinegar , 35 years . from my sister &apos;s husband &apos;s family .
live in modena .
so , aside from your dad ... was it wonderful being back in italy ?
it was wonderful , yeah .
go home and see your friends , your family .
i gotta be honest ...
it was not so nice .
i don &apos;t belong there no more . -no ?
something change .
maybe me .
what do you mean ?
i &apos;m like a visitor in my own town .
life went on without me .
there is nothing there for me now .
no special someone ?
i feel strange to live here also .
maybe i should never have come to america .
you &apos;ve made such a nice life for yourself , though .
you &apos;ve got a wonderful home . a girlfriend .
no .
what do you mean , no ?
jessica ?
i try to talk to her ... but there is no communication .
like with some people , you know what i mean ?
that &apos;s what love is built on . -si .
so why did you come back ?
you said you &apos;d take me to compusa so i could get a new magic stick .
and i will .
i got stuff to do . i told you .
i &apos;d better get going .
thank you very much for the vinegar .
where &apos;s branca ? she jump ship already ?
she &apos;s in hospital for a while .
cyst .
where &apos;s the old fart ? i gotta talk to him .
it &apos;s his afternoon nap . you want me to wake him ?
give him a while .
want some wine ?
from furio &apos;s uncle in italy ?
he says they had a lot of sun in this year .
salute .
it needs ice .
i &apos;m going to watch the bloomberg .
what &apos;s all that ?
i &apos;m making a website for my business .
you know how to do that ?
i &apos;m going to pay somebody ... $ 35 an hour ?
i stuck , i call bill .
you got married yet ?
maybe when he gets back from port st. lucie .
the baseball spring training for his mets .
that bill &apos;s a lucky man .
you russians , you got all the angles , you come over here , you bust your ass .
people are people .
look at you . you got every excuse to be in the bottle ...
and here you are designing websites .
what do you mean ? what excuse ?
your--
no , what ?
come on , you know , that--
my leg .
of course .
i don &apos;t think of it right away .
there are worse things .
... digital countdown timer with automatic shut @-@ off .
simply put your food in and set the timer , walk away .
your new george foreman grill will tell you exactly ...
when your food is grilled to perfection .
this grill does all the work for you .
with my exclusive 20 @-@ minute digital countdown timer with auto ....
heroin , you got only one option .
a dog you love catches rabies , you put her out of its misery , anthony .
salute .
so what do i do , uncle jun &apos; ?
the feds get him in his condition , who knows what he &apos;s liable to say .
you go on trial , like me , you won &apos;t sleep at night .
all the more reason to clean him up .
still , he &apos;s ....
he &apos;s a major liability . if it were anybody else ....
it reminds me of people &apos;s feet .
i don &apos;t know if i can do that other thing .
dominic palladino , do you remember him ?
b &amp; e guy , a real juicer .
he &apos;s in aa now .
i thought maybe i &apos;d give him a call .
they can treat this shit nowadays .
me with the competency hearings . you with the head shrinkers .
this one in rehab now .
i was so upset when he didn &apos;t bring me a present back from italy .
he got something for a.j. and for meadow .
he gave me some vinegar , but i don &apos;t think it was meant for me .
it must &apos;ve meant something , that he felt bad .
carmela , you sound like you &apos;re 15 years old .
i say i &apos;m helping him decorate .
i bring a.j. with me . now even he smells a rat .
if tony suspects one iota , you know what &apos;ll happen to furio .
these guys are living in a different century .
it didn &apos;t stop you .
steve at the gym ?
i felt so guilty all the time . the lies and the sneaking .
it took jackie going in the hospital to get me to stop .
we haven &apos;t slept together yet .
you &apos;re not fucking him ?
so this isn &apos;t really real .
it is real .
we communicate .
he looks at me like i &apos;m beautiful .
he thinks i &apos;m interesting when i talk .
just those few minutes when we see each other , i live for those .
i feel like my life is slipping through my fingers and i will never be happy .
if you haven &apos;t slept with him yet , don &apos;t .
and don &apos;t go over there anymore .
we &apos;re all here ?
good afternoon .
for those of you who don &apos;t know me , i am dominic ...
and i &apos;m an alcoholic and an addict .
don &apos;t forget &quot; scumbag . &quot;
as some of you obviously don &apos;t know ...
i &apos;ve also been in recovery now going on four years .
i joined aa in prison , and frankly , it saved my life .
okay , now , we &apos;re all here today because we have one thing in common .
not only do we share a certain background and culture ...
we care about chris and want to help him with his heroin addiction .
any one of you been involved in an intervention before ?
caught our daughter smoking pot once , but ....
not really , no .
no problem .
an intervention is a non @-@ judgmental confrontation .
a &quot; care @-@ frontation , &quot; we call it .
now , what i need from you guys is to make a list of specific times ...
where christopher &apos;s drug use impacted on you directly .
for example , adriana , is it ?
you would say something like this :
&quot; christopher , last monday you came home from work high ...
&quot; and belligerent , and you were physically abusive to me . &quot;
what if he &apos;s high when we try to talk to him ?
then we wait till he &apos;s sober . my first intervention , steven patrano
waited 10 hours for me to sober up .
your first intervention ?
in 1997 , i suffered a relapse .
as in heroin addiction , alcoholics suffer a fairly high recidivism rate .
great . so he &apos;s taking advice from a two @-@ time loser .
there are no losers in recovery .
actually , i never really met ralph &apos;s kid .
i saw him once from a distance , though .
handsome boy .
he &apos;s got a long struggle ahead of him , that &apos;s for sure .
doctors , rehab ... physical therapy ....
i think i &apos;m going to have the medallions of veal .
you make me late for a table at tavern on the fucking green ?
how &apos;s the real estate business ?
excuse me ?
you know , hud . garside street , you , ralph , zellman .
zellman tell you this ?
carmine doesn &apos;t know anything about this yet .
i &apos;m giving you an opportunity to cut a deal , make it right .
last time , frelinghuysen avenue ,
i cut you in out of friendship , but that &apos;s over .
you got nothing coming to you . you or carmine .
you sure you want to go down this road ?
how much to paint a different suit on him , change his face a little ?
pardon me ?
why throw it away ?
a stronger chin , maybe .
i was thinking like those paintings in the courthouse .
something classy , you know , like a revolutionary war general .
napoleon and his horse . that kind of thing .
he &apos;s rather portly to be napoleon .
not napoleon , exactly . like napoleon .
sit down . relax .
what &apos;s going on , ton &apos; ?
i think i know what happened to ralph , and if i &apos;m right ...
he ain &apos;t coming back .
it was new york .
johnny sack ?
what was it ? the fat joke ?
i &apos;m sure that didn &apos;t help .
carmine .
this hud thing we &apos;re into , they wanted a piece of it .
i think they confronted ralph ... things went sour .
what &apos;d he say , john ?
wasn &apos;t what he said so much
as what he didn &apos;t say .
we &apos;re talking about new york here .
before we do anything in terms of a payback ...
you go to your people . i want a full investigation .
nobody makes a move until we know what happened .
you understand ?
what the fuck ?
what &apos;s going on ?
have a seat .
i &apos;m dominic .
i know you don &apos;t know me , but ....
you &apos;re the guy who broke into stew leonard &apos;s that time .
you stole all those pork loins .
yeah , but that &apos;s not why i &apos;m here today .
we &apos;re here to talk about your drug problem .
what ?
jesus christ , you fucking kidding me ?
sorry , baby , please .
no , fuck this shit .
you were told once . now , sit down .
sit down .
ma ? jesus .
this won &apos;t be easy for any of us .
but i want you to know that we &apos;re here today because we care about you .
what was this , your idea ?
all we ask is that you listen .
adriana , you want to begin ?
&quot; christopher , i love you very much .
&quot; my only dream is that we have a happy life together .
&quot; the last few months , things have got very bad with us ...
&quot; because of you using drugs all the time .
&quot; you &apos;re high all the time and i can &apos;t take it . &quot;
be specific , hon .
&quot; when we first started going out , we made love all the time .
&quot; now , because of the drugs ... &quot;
jesus , is this fucking necessary ?
go ahead .
... &quot; you can no longer function as a man .
&quot; last week when i came home to learn that you had killed our dog ...
&quot; that was the final straw . &quot;
you killed the dog ? what &apos;d you do that for ?
it was an accident .
was it barking ?
he sat on her while he was high .
jesus christ .
i fell asleep .
she got suffocated or something .
are you done , adriana ?
you killed little cosette ?
i ought to suffocate you , you little prick !
tony , we &apos;re going in order .
&quot; when i came in to open up one morning ...
&quot; you had your head half in the toilet .
your hair was in the toilet water . &quot; disgusting . &quot;
i told you , i had the flu .
i said my piece .
great , i can &apos;t even defend myself , now ?
no one &apos;s attacking you .
it doesn &apos;t change anything .
but i can verify that he was sick for a little while .
this thing with the dog . how could you not see it on the chair ?
you &apos;re getting emotional .
that &apos;s because i know what it &apos;s like to lose a pet !
i happen to know that you were high at my mother @-@ in @-@ law &apos;s wake .
you were talking non @-@ stop for 20 minutes , nothing but gibberish .
my mother &apos;s wake .
jesus christ .
you want to read your statement ?
i don &apos;t write nothing down . so i &apos;ll keep this short and sweet .
you &apos;re weak . you &apos;re out of control .
you &apos;ve become an embarrassment to yourself and everybody else .
listen to you .
guys .
we said &quot; non @-@ judgmental . &quot;
fuck that . let him take his medicine .
seriously , you want to talk about fucking up ?
watch it , chrissy .
what ?
i thought we &apos;re being honest here .
you got some balls , you know that .
all of you .
you want to talk about self @-@ control , how about you , sil ?
fucking every slut working in the place when you got a wife and kids .
or you , paulie . remember last winter in the woods with the russian guy ?
i am warning you !
there he goes , mr. type a personality .
we &apos;re talking about you killing yourself with drugs !
not my fucking personality !
right .
i &apos;m going to kill myself ?
the way you eat , you &apos;ll have a heart attack before you &apos;re 50 .
sit down .
you &apos;re talking to the boss .
good , maybe someone will smack some goddamn sense into him !
great , my own mother . fuck you , you fucking whore !
son of a bitch !
guys , please !
come on !
excuse me . how &apos;s he doing ?
i &apos;m a relative .
he slipped off the kitchen counter spraying for ants ?
he was wearing socks .
are you aware that he has a drug problem ?
really ?
the man has a hairline skull fracture . we &apos;ll admit him , keep him overnight .
one minute .
give us a minute , okay ?
does it hurt ?
they gave me some aspirin .
enjoy it , because it &apos;s the last fucking drug you &apos;ll ever take .
i &apos;m sorry , t.
shut the fuck up and listen to me .
you &apos;re my nephew , christopher ,
and i love you .
that &apos;s the only reason you &apos;re alive right now .
if it were anybody else , anybody ...
they would &apos;ve had their intervention through the back of their head .
you and me , we &apos;re close .
we &apos;ve done a lot of things for each other .
that cop shot my father .
i know what you &apos;re telling me , i &apos;ll never forget that .
this is how you repay me .
i gotta worry if you &apos;ll flip over a nickel bag of white powder .
no , tony , never .
you lied to me .
i told you , you were the future of this family . i gave you that responsibility .
and you looked me in the eye , and you accepted it ...
and you were fucking high .
shut up .
tomorrow morning i gotta go with patsy up to this rehab place in pennsylvania .
you &apos;re going in . you &apos;re staying in .
you &apos;ll go to every session , and you &apos;ll keep your mouth shut .
now , if you need anything , anything at all ...
patsy &apos;s going to be half a mile away from you ... in a motel .
do you understand what i &apos;m saying to you ?
do you understand ?
tony , i &apos;m sorry !
how did i fucking get to this ?
so he comes again .
brought some pastries .
is he taking a nap ?
yeah .
is he driving you to drink ?
i can drive myself .
i needed that .
what &apos;s the matter ?
spent a long time in the hospital last night .
the shit that goes on down there .
i wasn &apos;t expecting visitors .
how about those mets ?
don &apos;t start with me and those mets .
you know , i was thinking about you .
so you &apos;re drunk already .
no . i was thinking about the way you are .
how you always have this little smile , like you got your own private joke .
you don &apos;t talk much , do you ?
i wish i knew your secret .
lose a leg and start making websites .
that &apos;s the whole purpose for people like me , to inspire people like you .
jesus , no offense .
that &apos;s the trouble with you americans .
you expect nothing bad ever to happen ...
when the rest of the world expects only bad to happen .
they &apos;re not disappointed .
that &apos;s a fucking grim outlook .
you have everything , and still you complain .
you lie on couches and bitch to your psychiatrist .
you got too much time to think about yourselves .
sounds like me all right .
you &apos;re not so bad .
you have many fine qualities .
you are big and strong ...
full of life , mischief .
i have always feel positive towards you .
you should see yourself now ...
