I had to take it.
I mean, have you really thought about
what he's gonna do? Everyone is gonna die --
everyone.
You did the right thing.
I'm gonna go to the police. I have to go to the police.
I'm gonna give it to them.
If I don't, if he goes through with it --
If he finds you, he might hurt you again.
Ju-- I'll come with you. Just...tell me where you are.
Just promise me you'll come alone.
I promise.
I'm sorry.
Where is it?
You get away from me.
You can't stop us now.
Everything is in place. It's too late.
You get away from me.
I always thought you were different.
But you're just like the rest.
You're selfish.
Give it to me.
No.
Help! Somebody call an ambulance!
That's crazy, man. I'm just like, "Whoa."
She just stepped out. She jumped in front of that car.

I told you to get rid of him.
Lizzy, I'm not getting rid of him.
Your safety is of great concern to me.
Yeah, I can handle myself.
I just -- I don't want him watching me.
What is all this?
There was an incident this morning in Dupont Circle.
A woman was struck by a taxi --
Carrie Ann Beck.
Maddox Beck's wife?
Yes. The leaders of the Front.
Well, how is that possible?
They died trying to bomb BP's London office
in response to the Gulf oil spill.
So the world believes.
In truth, they took their work underground.
Personally, I once admired Carrie Ann.
However, since going underground,
they've become too radical for my blood,
advocates for a level of destruction
that...I find chilling.
So who killed her?
I believe her husband is responsible.
I don't understand. Weren't they partners?
Didn't they found the Front together?
Yes, but their partnership was a tenuous one.
She was always the more moderate voice,
only interested in operations
that related directly to the environment.
Beck, on the other hand, views himself as a chosen one,
a messianic figure who sees humanity as a virus
that needs to be eradicated in order to save the planet.
I fear he got rid of his wife
because she was trying to stop him
from implementing a plan to do just that.
These are the last known photographs of Maddox Beck and his wife.
They're the founders of the Front.
2012 -- firebomb strikes a biotech park in Boston,
conducting genomics research, causing $64 million in damage.
2013 -- four staff members were killed and
4人被害 16人入院治疗
16 hospitalized.
Ricin was mailed to the Fairbanks BLM office,
which manages transatlantic pipeline.
Just got off with the M.E.
He'll have a tox work-up on Beck's wife within the hour.
We can't assume Beck killed her
just because Reddington says so.
Get to the morgue. I want a cause of death.
Her body's not at the morgue. She's at city memorial.
Labor and delivery.
She was pregnant?
Yeah, 30 weeks.
From what they can tell, the -- the baby's fine.
And the mother?
The doctors declared her brain dead.
They put her on life support
until they can safely deliver the -- the child.
Most of the injuries were sustained,
uh, during the accident,
but she suffered some injuries beforehand, as well --
lacerations to the -- the head and the hands
and, um, defensive bruises on the forearms.
Think he beat her?
I think she was in one hell of a fight.
You say in your notes
she had clay under her fingernails?
Clay?
From where? That's odd, isn't it?
The really odd part is that the -- the clay
is 700 years old.
The soil found under the nails of Carrie Ann Beck
dates back to the 14th century.
It's called raw sienna.
Okay, so, what's it doing there?
Raw sienna was used by painters at the time,
painters who belonged to what's known as the Sienese school.
The prado in Madrid has an exhibit going on right now
featuring paintings from the Sienese school.
Last week, one of those paintings was stolen.
That's what she and Beck were fighting over, this painting.
Maybe they were trying to sell it on the black market,
fund their operation.
There were 22 paintings at the exhibit.
The one that was stolen had been on loan
from the Santa Caterina Church in Pisa,
and it was, by far, the least valuable.
Then why did they steal it?
♬His crusade was a search for God♬
♬And they say♬
♬It's been a long way♬
♬To carry on♬

♬The town I've left behind♬

Come on!
Number 76.
Number 76!
I've been busting my ass!
And now you fire me because I'm not, what, fast enough?!
I'll need all your research.
No!
And any leads as to her whereabouts.
You want me to find the girl? I'll find the girl.
But these things take time!
You don't have any leads.
You know what? I don't have time!
And yet you've had me waiting out there for over 45 minutes!
Do you know the vending machine is broken?
It's as if you enjoy making people miserable!
I work at the DMV!
If you can't do this, I need to find someone who can.
Everything rests on finding the girl.
I understand, and I'm trying my best.
But you didn't give me much to go on,
and I've had some --
Is something wrong?
You know what?
Just forget it!
Talk to me.
It's mom.
Ohh, Glen.
Three months ago, she was in the shower,
noticed this...lump.
How bad?
Got into her bones.
They bombarded her with chemo.
We've tried everything --
the pills and the diets, biofeedback,
music therapy, the flaxseed diet.
Flax seed?
Part of the Budwig Protocol.
I don't have time for this.
Oh, I'm sorry!
Has mom's illness cramped your busy schedule?!
Every time you can't deliver, you do this --
these cockamamie stories!
My mother is dying!
Yes, and your brother-in-law had legionnaires disease,
and your house was flooded,
and I'm still no closer to finding the girl.
Get out!
You're the most gifted tracker I know, Glen,
but your mouth runs like a scalded dog.
I don't know why you're mad at me.
You're the one who came up short.
Codes. What kind of codes?
You mean written on the back of the painting?
Not on the back -- under the paint.
The museum sent us everything they had
on the stolen painting.
When it was acquired last year,
they ran a series of tests to determine its authenticity.
Yeah, they used thermal imaging to do microscopic
and spectroscopic analysis and found this.
What's it mean?
Museum doesn't know. I spoke with the curator.
Call the National Gallery. Get Lillian Sharp in here.
If anyone can make heads or tails of this, she can.
Keen -- where is she?
She had an appointment.
Look, when I agreed to do this, I --
It's just taking longer than I thought.
Is he out there?
Yeah. I'm going out back.
This is for last week.
Do it one more week, and I'll pay you double.
I'll be back in one hour.
It's a map.
A map to what?
A bedtime story.
It's a legend about the Apophis strain,
an ancient plague weaponized in the 14th century,
by both the Byzantines and the Ottomans
that was mistakenly released
and believed to be the real origin of the Black Death.
You're talking about the bubonic plague.
No -- pneumonic plague,
which is airborne and far more fatal.
Scientists now believe that was the plague
that killed 200 million people,
one of the largest pandemics in history.
That's why, to prevent armageddon,
the sworn enemies agreed to task four priests
to take the strain to the end of the world.
And this map indicates
in which end of the world it's hidden.
Agent Cooper,
you're not taking this seriously, are you?
Maddox Beck is.
He killed his wife to get this map.
These symbols -- trust me. This map is worthless.
Thursday. Same time?
Keen.
Lizzy, I need to see you. There's been a development.
This map is priceless.
You need to move on this now.
If the Apophis strain is out there --
You didn't tell this to the FBI?
Lillian is paid to embargo certain key details
from your colleagues
if she believes they may be of interest to me.
You sure she can be trusted?
I could say the same thing about you.
Ladies, please.
I'm surprised the two of you haven't met
at a conference or company retreat.
Does the FBI do a Christmas party?
One of the priests sent to guard the strain got sick.
And to protect it, the dying man swallowed it whole,
taking it to his grave.
We know this because the others survived
and created the map.
And the markings? What do they mean?
They're archetypal alignments.
When you connect them, they create lay lines
linking a network of historically significant sites.
You said the priests were sent to the end of the world.
Where?
Well, I said it was the end of the world -- not anymore.
If I'm reading this correctly, the strain is buried here --
in America.
Red's source says the map points
to burial ridge in Staten Island.
It's the largest native American burial ground in New York.
We've contacted local authorities.
We're on our way now.
I-I don't know how to break this to you,
But, uh, Beck beat you there.
What are you talking about?
New York field office
got called in on a grave robbery.
According to park police,
our guy, Beck, he knew exactly where to look.
The bones contain the DNA of the plague.
Once he has it, he can replicate it.
That's why he took the bones.
No, he wanted to take them, but according to park police,
whoever was buried there was moved.
Hundreds of years ago.
I'm sending you an image of what was left in its place.
Got it.
We think it's a marker, some sort of addendum to the map.
It's Cyrillic.
It's ancient Cyrillic. It looks like some sort of equation.
"P" equals 100.
"O" that sort of looks like a ribbon equals 9.
Those dash symbols in between
denotes that the number to the right
should be multiplied by 1,000.
It totals 109,120.
Probably a measurement. Is there a standard form?
Cubits.
Uh, one cubit is half a yard.
109,120 cubits is 54,560 yards.
What?
I was good at math.
There's another engraving here. Looks like, what, a moon?
Or a sun, which rises in the east.
The strain's final resting place.
54,560 yards or exactly 31 miles.
Hello, Aram. Agent Navabi.
You certainly look radiant.
Mr. Reddington. Um...
If you're looking for, uh, A-Agent Keen --
I'm not. I'm looking for you.
Aram, are you there? What is it?
What's 31 miles east of Burial Ridge?
纽约
This is the oldest church in the city.
The graves in the church, they're sacrosanct.
Is there another way in here?
The southeast stairwell, behind the
Show me.
You want me to find a girl.
You can't tell me her name,
and none of the other people who work for you
were able to find her.
Yes.
That's not much to go on.
It's not.
Out of curiosity, the other people who couldn't find her,
this...girl...um...
W-what -- what did you do to them?
Aram, this woman is critical in my war with Berlin.
FBI! Don't move!
You know what I have in here.
You wouldn't be here if you didn't.
Put it down.
It's incredible, isn't it?
Finding America a century before Columbus,
surviving, protecting the secret.
His life had one purpose -- the plague.
You're not walking out of here.
Do you know how contagious this is?
Shoot me, I drop it,
and then we're both infected.
I said put it down.
Either you let me go, or we both die.
The choice is yours.
You're just like everybody else.
You're gonna save your life
at the expense of millions of others.
Is that why you killed your wife?
Carrie Ann killed herself.
She wasn't able to go through with it,
but somebody needs to have the courage
to do what's necessary.
Radio Foster. Tell him we're on our way.
Ressler!
They have it. It's gone.
The plague, it's gone.
Call state and local police.
Tell them we want lookouts and checkpoints
at every highway leading out of the city.
Find Maddox Beck!
You had him.
He was in possession of the strain.
Did you hesitate or not?
He threatened to release it.
And now a mad man is out there
with the ability to start a pandemic.
Enough. If it's the pneumonic plague,
there are antibiotics, protocols.
For the strain that exists today,
not the one that's 700 years old.
We have to assume that there is no cure
for whatever Beck got his hands on.
I said that's enough.
This is unbelievable.
Alert the C.D.C.
Tell them that a potential category 5 threat
has just been identified with no cure
and a high probability of exposure.
Agent Keen.
Whatever decision you made, I'm sure it was the right one.
I've seen you under pressure in the moment.
Thank you.
I mean it.
The way you handle --
Take Mr. Reddington, for example.
He asked me to do one thing, and I freeze up,
but you're always able to - - What?
What? What are you talking about?
Oh, wait. Uh, no, just, um... you're solid.
Reddington asked you to do -
No, forget that -- bad example.
What did Reddington ask you to do?
200.
That is the exact number of species
that grows extinct every year.
That is 10,000 times
the natural rate of extinction,
And one species is responsible.
Ours.
The reason that we are making the ultimate sacrifice...
...is because earth is literally dying.
Everybody knows it,
and no one will do anything about it.
To preserve life on earth,
we need to become...
extinct.
Sharon.
It's time.
Your wife made it perfectly clear
your daughter has no interest in seeing you.
Oh, dear.
The F.B.I. is not in the business
of handling your personal affairs.
The F.B.I. is in the business of my business.
Why else would I be in business with the F.B.I.?
If she is in danger, we will protect her,
either from Berlin or you.
Who told you she's my daughter?
You have no right to have anything to do with that girl,
not since the night you abandoned her.
I'm touched.
You just upended your ex-wife's entire life.
I'm not gonna let you do the same thing to her.
As a rule, I consider jealousy to be a base emotion.
But in this case, it's quite endearing.
Oh, God. I am not jealous.
I assure you, Lizzy,
my quest to find this young woman
will in no way compromise our relationship.
"Our relationship"?
Where are we on the case?
No, no, no.
We're not doing that.
I understand you lost Beck. It must be disheartening.
Let me be perfectly clear.
Aram is not going to help you find your daughter.
And the guy you have following me --
either you get rid of him, or I will.

♬I better go it alone♬
It's about Agent Keen.
♬Na, na, na, na na♬
Sir.
She seems unusually agitated.
I'm not sure why,
but I believe she's hiding something from me.
♬Down on the corner♬
♬See me standing on a makeshift home♬
♬With the dust storm blowing♬
♬Na, na, na, na na. In a long black shadow♬
Hiding what?
I'm not sure.
♬Pull a hammer from a coal mine♬
But I think she's worried you may expose her.
♬Comb my hair back♬
She's made it clear she wants you gone.
♬Where my number was written♬
I told her that's not an option.

I think she may try to manipulate the situation.

Don't worry.
I've got eyes on her as we speak.

I need to go inside.

Can I go inside?

♬In a voice that was singing underneath the window♬
♬Na, na, na, na, na♬

Amen.
Unconfirmed reports indicate hundreds
have been infected as a result of the outbreak.
The capitol and the supreme court have been evacuated.
Metro police have quarantined a 15-block area,
reaching from Constitution to Pennsylvania avenue.
Patient zero has been I.D.'d as Sharon McManus.
Prelim autopsy confirms we are dealing with
a genetically modified strain of pneumonic plague.
Modified how?
We have no idea,
but it is working at an accelerated rate.
People in the quarantine, none of them look sick yet.
From what the CDC can tell,
the contagion works in three phases,
the first of which is incubation.
Right now, it is dormant in their immune systems.
It is not airborne yet,
but that is only going to last for the first few hours.
Then what?
It turns the victim symptomatic, then infectious.
Based on what we can tell from the time of death
and the rapid depletion of patient zero's target cells,
those healthy-looking people will be dead in nine hours.
How many people are we talking about?
Roughly 2,300 in quarantine, sir.
Talk to me about the treatment protocols.
There are none.
In order to understand how the disease was altered,
to find a cure, we need a sample of the original strain.
And Beck has the only one.
Full E.R.T. report on patient zero's effects just came in.
They found this on the victim's shirt --
hair from a rodent,
a rat species specifically bred for scientific purposes.
Rattus norvegicus.
There are only two licensed suppliers for clinical trials.
And in the last month, they've only had one shipment
that didn't go to a university or research facility.
You got Beck's shipping address.
Two storied property in Thurmont.
Send the biohazard team at Quantico.
Clear!
I need you to come in.
I found your girl.
Number 84.
The picture you gave me, the one of the girl --
I had it aged up in the system
and marked as an FBI inquiry five weeks ago.
The vending machine is still not working.
Then Dolly goes in for hair plugs.
She's the only one in the Southwest Service Center with access,
so I'm frozen out.
The woman grading the written tests needs to shower.
But this morning, Dolly comes back, and guess what.
Old Dolly got a hit...
A 97% match on your girl.
Zoe Dantonio.
As I said, these things take time.
What the hell is that?
It's a new vending machine.
Yours is broken.
Consider it a bonus.
Site's decontaminated.
The equipment looks like it's been used recently.
My God.
D.C. was just the beginning.
24 cities. On every continent.
They're gonna be on planes.
Aram, get me the FAA.
When an organism is ill,
it develops antibodies to combat the illness.
Nature creates the instruments to eradicate deadly disease.
In this case, the disease is humanity.
We're the antidotes.
Climate change, water shortages,
a population approaching eight billion...
We won't live to see it.
And there will be no one left to remember.
But our sacrifice
will usher in the dawn of a new earth.
Sharon began our crusade,
and now the rest of us must see it through.
To a new day.
To a new day.
CDC quarantined a vehicle found at Dulles.
There was an inhaler mask discovered outside of the car.
We won't have the official results for a few hours,
but the toxins inside
appear to match those found in Beck's lab.
Vehicle's owner was one Ron Crocker,
boarded a plane to Panama City two hours ago.
Every passenger on that flight will be infected.
We have Crocker's travel profile?
Yeah.
One-way ticket, traveling alone,
no checked baggage.
Ticket purchased within the last eight hours.
Can you apply the same criteria to passengers on flights
from Dulles to the other target cities?
Every matching profile is a potential follower
infected with the plague.
Okay, 31 matches.
Of those seven are business travelers
who made last-minute reservations using corporate cards.
Are they already in flight?
All but one -- Chris Perez.
Leaves Dulles for Toronto within one hour.
Probably still in the incubation period.
We can take him down, isolate him before he boards.
You work with Aram.
Notify the FAA of those infected flights.
You get to Dulles,
make sure Perez does not get on that flight.
Final boarding for Flight 428,
service to Toronto, please proceed to Gate A.
We've located four of the suspects.
Two land in 45 minutes -- Moscow and Sao Paulo.
Get word to the air marshals on board.
Have teams on the tarmacs ready to quarantine those planes.
Contact the TSA and have them patch us
into the airport security feeds.
We have to assume the passengers are all infected.
Quarantine won't help them, only the cure.
Which we don't have.
Follow me, please.
Coming through!
Make way! Federal agents coming through!
Stand aside, please!
Coming through here! Federal agents!
He's not at the gate.
Aram, you got eyes?
Looking. Looking now.
I'm gonna double back.
Okay.
Come on.
Go back -- there.
That's him.
There he is.
A black jacket with a gray hoodie, a green shoulder bag.
Near Gate C-13.
What's going on?
Officer down! I need a medic!
You can't come in here.
Samar, you're gonna bleed out! You've got to open this door!
It's out. I'm infected.
If you come in here, you will be, too.
You'll be okay.
18 of the flights have been quarantined,
and the suspects have been arrested.
The others -- diverted with military escorts.
What about the infected?
Liz and Samar -- how much time do they have?
Worst-case scenario -- eight hours.
I was able to trace a credit card
tied to the plane tickets Beck purchased,
but he created a VPN.
The computer he used
accessed the Internet within a 50-mile radius of Abingdon.
Get our people in Virginia the coordinates.
Have them start a canvass.
And the radius -- narrow it down.
Mr. Reddington, I-I'm calling about Agent Keen.
Circumstances have changed, Aram.
I found what I was looking for.
You have? I mean, uh, you have.
That's so -- that's fantastic.
But, uh, that's actually -- that's not why I'm calling.
Uh, Agent Keen, she and Agent Navabi,
they've been infected.
When?
Just over an hour ago.
Where are you on Beck?
He's somewhere outside Abingdon, but I don't know where.
I've searched the public record --
uh, tax bills, power, phone.
It's like -- it's like he lives off the grid.
Well, there you have it.
Have what?
Hello?
What?
Nothing.
What made you smile?
Nipple guards.
A year ago, I, uh...
Tom and I, we were going to adopt a newborn,
and we were having a baby shower.
And one of the guests,
this teacher, she brought nipple guards.
Did she know you were adopting?
Uh, exactly, yes, she --
it was like she was reminding me that I wasn't pregnant.
I was just so pissed. I didn't even thank her.
God, I wish I could just go back and thank her.
I had it all figured out.
I was gonna have a baby...
and a husband.
And then he showed up.
You know everyone talks about it, right?
They don't want to bring it up with you.
Why you? Who is he to you?
Reddington is...
the bane of my existence.
And yet, here he is, trying to reconnect with his daughter?
Trying to find her?
And I find myself feeling possessive.
Possessive of him,
jealous of the girl he's trying to protect.
And if that's not embarrassing enough,
that's exactly how he predicted I'd feel.
You think they've delivered that baby yet?
Carrie Ann Beck's?
That's probably why she backed out, right?
Because of that baby.
And when they find a cure, when we walk out of here,
it'll all be because of that baby.
I figured it out.
Technically, Mr. Reddington figured it out,
but I think I know where Beck is.
He's a radical environmentalist,
so any electricity would be solar.
We have a 50-mile search area. That could be dozens of houses.
Using grid-tied power.
But people who want to sever ties with the government,
they would use off-grid systems, which are very uncommon.
How uncommon?
I could only find one
with the capability to support a compound large enough
for Beck and his followers.
Um, I should mention --
I'm pretty sure Mr. Reddington has a head start.
Pepper, what's...
You two out here playing grab-ass in the woods
just smacks of something biblical.
Who the hell are you?
I'm the snake in the grass.
I was a big fan of yours at one time.
I remember you
in that little, inflatable boat in the North Sea,
going up against that oil platform,
huge waves tossing you up against the pilings,
fire hoses and steel oil drums raining down from above.
My God, it gives me goose bumps just thinking about it.
Then I had the good fortune
of sharing a cell in a prison outside Sochi
with a -- an associate of yours, Yevgeny Bushkin --
big bear of a man, 150 kilos on an empty belly.
As I remember it, Yevgeny went on hunger strike
to protest some oil pipeline
that threatened a vital something-or-other.
You probably remember better than I.
But the point is the old boy
didn't eat for 74 days.
Imagine that.
I wouldn't have the discipline.
My weakness is sausage and peppers.
But Yevgeny...
he did it.
Wasted away like christ on the cross,
dying for a cause --
your cause.
And I remember thinking that the only men I've known
that have people who are willing to die for their cause
are either saints or megalomaniacs.
And you...
are no saint.
Which is why I'm not surprised
to find you and Pepper waiting out Armageddon
here in Eden.
You and I both know
you're not gonna die for your cause.
Put that down.
You dig up a plague,
hatch a plan to spread it around the world,
but before you do, you synthesize a cure --
for yourself and your Eve.
Ironic, isn't it.
If you were half as dedicated to your cause
as Yevgeny was, there would be no vaccine,
I wouldn't be here,
and you and Pepper would be free to romp like bunnies
until the convulsing and hemorrhaging started.
You're wrong.
My actions are about our crimes against the earth.
I'll be frank, Mr. Beck,
because I'm in a bit of a hurry.
I'm not here for you.
I think you know what I'm about to ask for.
What's he talking about?
You never told him?
Told me what?
Where is it?
Please. Don't.
Never told me what?
We don't have much time.
My business is finished here.
I'll leave the two of you.
I'm sure you have plenty to discuss.
♬You were born into a strange world♬
♬Like a candle, you were meant to share the fire♬

♬She'll build you armor, keep you warm as a hen♬
♬The stars may fall♬
♬The rains may pour♬
♬But I will love you evermore♬
♬'Cause you were born♬
