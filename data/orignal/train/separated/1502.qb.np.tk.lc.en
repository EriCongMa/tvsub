oh , new yorker , you &apos;ve done it again .
jay , check out this cartoon .
does it have a talking dog ?
no , it &apos;s a commentary on ...
i &apos;m out .
here you go ,
one of my best efforts .
have at it .
mm , i can &apos;t eat that .
why not ?
the pickle &apos;s touching it .
there .
the juice got on the bread and , ew , what &apos;s that stuff ?
spices .
they look like sea monkeys .
have you ever really examine a jar of pickles , jay ?
it &apos;s like a swamp there . i &apos;ll pass .
what happened ?
i made him a beautiful sandwich and he won &apos;t eat it .
yeah , &apos; cause it had pickles on it .
joe is taking a nap .
i &apos;m gonna go to the dry cleaners .
well , if you &apos;re passing a sushi restaurant --
she &apos;s not .
i &apos;ve never heard of anyone not liking pickles .
aw , big day for you , then .
i &apos;m just gonna make myself a grilled cheese .
i think i saw some gruye in there .
do we have any fig ?
sit down .
this whole persnickety thing is not gonna fly in the world .
never hand people another reason to make fun of you .
you mean like all the cool kids
with their leather jackets and their pickles ?
well , you &apos;re gonna sit there
until you at least try a pickle .
you &apos;re drunk with power .
you got that right .
oh , no .
what ?
the tonys are coming .
cam , this is exactly why i don &apos;t want you watching them --
you &apos;re already so angry .
not that tonys --
anthony lamarque , botox tony .
they &apos;re coming to the wedding .
but , seriously , another revival of &quot; anything goes &quot; ?
are we really doing this again ?
i &apos;m surprised that they &apos;re coming ,
because when i mentioned the wedding to tony ,
he seemed completely disinterested --
oh , the botox .
oh , no .
your cousin pete , all of his kids .
everyone &apos;s accepting , mitchell !
we haven &apos;t even gotten the list from my dad yet .
and your dad &apos;s friends drink like soldiers .
because they were soldiers .
i mean , i am grateful for their service ,
but we are not gonna be able to afford this wedding .
okay , maybe we need to pull back on a few things .
like what ?
uh , the centerpieces ?
why even have a wedding ?
i don &apos;t know , cam .
because we love and respect each other
and we &apos;re raising a child together ?
do you want to help or not ?
maybe we could send un @-@ vitations .
is that a thing ?
we &apos;ve already made a lot of people angry
by just being able to get married .
let &apos;s not alienate the ones on our side .
all right . maybe we could sell something .
we &apos;re thousands over budget .
it would have to be something great .
here , you can sell my diamond ring .
oh , honey , that &apos;s candy .
i &apos;m gonna kill that jackson !
i do have something of value --
a &quot; spider @-@ man versus doctor octopus &quot; comic book .
issue number 3 , 1963 , near @-@ mint condition .
it &apos;s worth 5 grand .
i traded a football for it when i was 9 years old ,
and my dad was mad
because the football was signed by dan marino .
i said , &quot; get it signed by rita moreno , and i &apos;ll keep it . &quot;
oh , no .
my nephews are flying in from tulsa
- the big ones .
the pie eaters ?
that &apos;s it . i got to sell my wyatt earp .
this here is a belt buckle once worn
by the great wyatt earp .
my grandpa gave it to me when i was 7 years old ,
and he said , &quot; son , this will keep the bad guys away . &quot;
in my early 20s , i wore it to
a cowboys @-@ and @-@ indians disco party .
and let &apos;s just say it didn &apos;t .
no . i can &apos;t let you do that .
that means the world to you .
cam , i will sell my &quot; spider @-@ man . &quot;
mitchell , my belt buckle was owned
by a legend of the old west .
i don &apos;t think your comic book
would even cover our balloon budget .
well , that &apos;s very offens--
wait . what &apos;s the balloon budget ?
hey , mom , can we put this stuff somewhere else ?
it &apos;s cluttering up my room .
what is it ?
oh , just some mementos of mine .
a few of your dad &apos;s .
oh , zima !
yeah .
what &apos;s zima ?
just a party in a bottle .
man , that reminds me of some wild times .
cranking the bjork in my saturn
before me and my buddies snuck some &quot; z &quot;
into &quot; sleepless in seattle . &quot;
i wish you &apos;d covered my ears for that .
ooh , mom . who &apos;s this hottie with his arm around you ?
cute !
oh , that &apos;s bobby nash , my old boyfriend .
why &apos;d you break up with him ? for dad ?
let &apos;s just say he took his eye
off the ball and struck out .
so i stepped up to the plate
and nailed her in the cheap seats .
yeah , let &apos;s not say that .
well , i &apos;m off .
oh , honey , i &apos;ve got to stop by the drug store .
do you need anything ?
no , thank you , my dear .
the dunphy glands produce all the drugs i need .
except for , uh , foot spray .
could you grab me some of that ?
sure .
oh , wow , mom !
what a dork , right ?
what were you thinking ?
it was comfortable . my dad didn &apos;t approve .
enough said .
i know it &apos;s hard to believe ,
but i was actually a bit of a nerd back in the day .
and it was suggested that i was out of my league
when i landed claire .
by jay , mostly .
and my friends . a @-@ and my parents .
and claire .
what &apos;s this ?
oh , my gosh .
that is your father &apos;s answering machine from college .
god , i sometimes forget how old you guys are .
you &apos;ve reached phil &apos;s world !
party time ! excellent !
he &apos;s so cute .
hi , phil . this is mitchell ,
uh , pritchett , claire &apos;s brother .
i just wanted to thank you for setting me up with your cousin .
she was very nice .
the only problem is she lives kinda far , so ...
that &apos;s the only problem ?
hey , dunph @-@ dog , it &apos;s ling .
grab your rollerblades
and meet us at the bike path , playa !
but i got to be done by 3 : 00,
&apos;cause today &apos;s the day i fly my new helicopter .
phil , hey , it &apos;s claire . um ...
i need to tell you something ,
and i don &apos;t want to do it on your machine .
it &apos;s really important --
oh , no , no , no .
you know , life @-@ and @-@ death important .
come on . come on .
not death , um , just life .
i mean ... i just -- oh , hell , i &apos;m pregnant !
oh , sweet newlyweds !
don &apos;t worry . you don &apos;t have to marry me or anything .
let &apos;s talk as soon as you can .
why weren &apos;t we more careful ?
stupid duran duran concert .
all right !
that &apos;s enough .
i was conceived at a duran duran concert ?
classy start to a classy life .
you were not conceived at the concert .
it was after the concert .
oh , wha-- in the car ? !
it was a very nice car .
listen , i am done . stop snooping . i &apos;m going .
the seats folded all the way back .
oh , images .
i can &apos;t believe they kept it .
i have a name .
the answering machine .
you know , we could have some fun with this .
i &apos;m home !
hi , mom .
manny , what are you doing sitting in front of a pickle ?
jay says i can &apos;t leave until i taste it .
why do you torture him like this ?
&apos;cause he &apos;s too stuck in his ways , gloria .
this is good for him .
he &apos;ll taste the pickle , he &apos;ll find that he likes it ,
he &apos;ll try more things .
this is good parenting .
this is not going to play well in my memoir .
you know , you &apos;re one to talk .
how many times have i asked you
to try my mother &apos;s blood sausages ?
totally different . that &apos;s disgusting .
how do you know it &apos;s disgusting if you &apos;ve never tried it ?
you &apos;ve never tried grandma &apos;s delicious blood sausage
that &apos;s right there in the freezer ?
oh , you &apos;re right .
we do have some left over .
really ? it hasn &apos;t been all gobbled up yet ?
okay , mr. father of the year ,
time for you to show manny that you &apos;re not a hypocrite .
looks like you &apos;re in quite a conundrum .
you know , you could &apos;ve said --
&quot; a pickle &quot; ! dang it ! it was right there .
hello .
hi . can i help you ?
uh , yes .
um , i have something pretty special
that means the world to me ,
yet i gladly part with it
to prove my love for my fiance
cam , you don &apos;t have to ...
i do .
this is a belt buckle that was once owned
by the legendary wyatt earp .
and when my grandfather gave it to me , and rest his soul ,
he said &quot; son , this year is a
are you ok ?
i can &apos;t be here for this . you do it .
and get a price on that divine lamp .
um , anyway ...
look , i didn &apos;t want to say anything
in front of your fiance
but this is a cheap replica
given away by a gas @-@ station chain in the &apos; 60s .
there &apos;s tons of them out there .
it &apos;s worth about 20 bucks .
are you sure ?
pretty sure .
that family loves to dress up a story .
and a pig .
well , how about a first @-@ edition number 3
&quot; spider @-@ man versus doctor octopus &quot; in near @-@ mint condition ?
keep talking .
that ...
uh , uh , that &apos;s pretty much it .
why isn &apos;t she calling ?
aren &apos;t you the doubter ?
she &apos;ll call in three ...
two @-@ o @-@ o @-@ o ...
one ! one &apos;s next !
yeah .
press record .
hi , mom .
haley , honey ,
did you mean to send this text to your dad ?
text ? what does it say ?
&quot; i hate to spoil your golf game , but ... &quot;
uh , no , no . i @-@ i didn &apos;t send that .
must have accidentally dictated
when you and dad were talking .
okay . that &apos;s weird .
well , while i have you on the phone ,
would you mind emptying the dishwasher and doing --
oh , you &apos;re breaking up .
haley , can you hear me now ?
nope . bye .
got it .
told you we &apos;d get it .
now just for a little creative editing ...
your mind is so brilliant .
if you put this much effort into your schoolwork ,
there is no telling the things you could --
why do you have to ruin everything ?
i know , she &apos;s always talking about my potential .
fore !
do you think i hit her ?
nah , she &apos;s fine .
sorry i &apos;m so distracted today .
what &apos;s wrong , buddy ?
let me ask you something .
do -- do you ever get the sense
that your wife feels like she could have done better ?
god , no . nah , she &apos;s the luckiest woman on earth .
i mean , if anything , i could &apos;ve done better .
the noises that come out of that woman at night ?
it &apos;s like she &apos;s that black guy from &quot; police academy . &quot;
oh , speak of the devil .
message from my wife ,
not the black guy from &quot; police academy . &quot;
oh , that &apos;d be so awesome .
that would be neat .
phil ? hey , it &apos;s claire .
um , i hate to spoil your golf game , but ...
i &apos;m pregnant !
what ?
let &apos;s talk as soon as you can .
i have to leave .
what ? we &apos;re in the middle of a game .
i have to be with claire !
oh -- my clubs !
my hat !
my sandwich !
i &apos;m sorry i freaked out in there .
how -- how much did we get for it ?
you know , here . i couldn &apos;t do it .
what ? no .
this belt buckle means so much to you .
i &apos;m just gonna -- i am going to sell my comic book instead .
oh , mitchell , that is so sweet . you know --
the idea of me parting ways with a belt buckle
that my grandfather arm @-@ wrestled wyatt earp for --
he arm @-@ wrestled him ?
oh , yeah , but not in a contentious way .
you know , they were friends .
my grandfather saved his life during a train robbery .
a -- a train robbery ? that &apos;s -- wow .
cam , wow !
they had a real bond .
the great wyatt earp and honest abe tucker .
i have it , i &apos;ll store it ,
and if i need to , i will use it .
you know what ? i quit .
pardon me for trying to broaden his horizons .
no , no , no . you &apos;re not quitting anything .
you &apos;re going to eat your sausage ,
and you &apos;re going to eat your pickle .
i am tired of every day cooking two different meals .
no tomatoes . white meat only . extra bacon .
he gets extra bacon ? what the hell ?
today is the day you two are stopping this silliness !
fine , we &apos;ll all conquer something today .
what do i have to conquer ? i eat everything .
pet stella &apos;s belly .
what ?
you won &apos;t touch stella &apos;s belly .
yeah , because it &apos;s the creepiest thing ever .
has like 30 nipples .
i &apos;ll eat the blood sausage ,
manny eats the pickles ,
you pet her belly .
i &apos;d rather eat the dog .
don &apos;t be a hypocrite .
nice and long , like you mean it .
i want to see that leg shake .
let me get these !
what &apos;s happening ?
i &apos;m just so happy !
really ?
oh , did you finally get a hole in one ?
a hole in one .
i hope our baby has your sense of humor .
our what ?
why didn &apos;t i see it ?
the drug store , the bloated ankles ,
you &apos;ve been so moody lately ...
what are you talking about ?
there it is .
phil , i am not pregnant .
you &apos;re not ?
no .
well , why &apos;d you leave me that message ?
didn &apos;t leave you a message .
are you sure ? you &apos;re very forgetful when you &apos;re pregnant .
i think i would remember !
then why have you been so moody ?
maybe because you just told me i have giant ankles !
shh , i don &apos;t want him to hear us fight like this .
give me this .
okay . this is gonna be good for everybody ,
so let &apos;s get it over with .
fine .
okay .
we &apos;ll go on the count of three .
one ...
two ...
three .
uh ! oh , no !
i &apos;m gonna throw up !
why so moist , jay ? ! why ? !
is this a bad time ?
sorry to barge in here like this .
i guess it &apos;s weird that , uh , i &apos;m still storing stuff here .
i just wish you would have come in sooner
before i went to second base with stella .
all right , i &apos;ll be two minutes .
if you need money for the wedding ,
why sell something that you love ?
why don &apos;t you just ask jay ?
no . no . no . no .
why not ? he &apos;s your father .
i don &apos;t feel right asking my dad for money , okay ?
i &apos;m an adult , and i have my comic book .
i hate to spoil your golf game , but ...
i &apos;m pregnant !
let &apos;s talk as soon as you can .
oh , they are good .
i can &apos;t believe they pulled such an elaborate stunt .
i don &apos;t know whether to be angry or impressed .
it &apos;s so diabolical .
i don &apos;t know where they get that ...
wait . wait . wait .
we could really have some fun with this .
you know , it &apos;s funny ,
i never saw you as a comic @-@ book guy .
oh , no , i wasn &apos;t , but i don &apos;t know .
spider @-@ man --
he -- he spoke to me .
i -- i think it &apos;s because it &apos;s about this nerdy kid
who has this special secret side of himself
that he can &apos;t share with anybody , and --
and that &apos;s how i always felt .
spider @-@ man made me feel like it was okay to be different .
and ... it made me feel tough enough to --
to get through the rough times .
oh , mitchell , that &apos;s so sweet .
i didn &apos;t know that .
are you sure you want to sell it ?
yes , yes .
because , like spider @-@ man , i am brave and strong .
oh ! spider web ! spider web !
mitchell .
it &apos;s in my mouth .
oh , mitchell !
what ? ! oh !
no ! no ! oh , no !
give me a break , phil !
what do you want from me ? !
shh !
i didn &apos;t say anything .
a little compassion when you thought i was pregnant
would have been nice !
i &apos;m sorry . it was a knee @-@ jerk reaction .
you got that half right !
well , you &apos;re not pregnant , anyway , so who cares ? !
and what did i say that was so terrible ? !
well , i believe your exact words were ,
&quot; great , another kid that we could screw up . &quot;
oh , i &apos;m sorry . but we both know that &apos;s true .
wait . are you saying we never should have them in the first place .
like you never said that !
this is awful .
this is what you thought gonna happen ?
i didn &apos;t think that far ahead .
i never do . you know that .
you should &apos;ve stopped me !
you said this was going to be fun !
nobody is having fun !
careful ? ! please , phil !
if you hadn &apos;t gotten me pregnant ,
i never would have married you !
i would have married bobby nash !
you would ? !
oh , yeah !
and right now , i would be on my 100 @-@ acre ranch in aspen
with my strapping 6 &apos; 4 &quot; hedge @-@ fund husband !
you really wish you &apos;d married bobby ?
oh , every single day !
no , phil .
dad , are you okay ?
yep .
that &apos;s what i am to everyone around here .
mom ...
just &quot; okay . &quot;
phil !
hey , mom ?
not now .
phil !
you guys hear that ? we totally got them !
quick ! we need a blow dryer !
is this some sort of gay emergency ?
no , dad , it &apos;s not a gay emergency !
it &apos;s my comic book .
we need to -- ohh , god !
it &apos;s ruined .
mitchell , it &apos;s okay .
it probably wasn &apos;t worth that much anyway .
it was worth $ 5,000 ! your belt buckle is garbage .
it came from a gas station !
your grandfather never met wyatt earp !
i didn &apos;t hold on to that for quite as long as i thought .
hey , i &apos;m sorry .
i -- i didn &apos;t mean to blurt it out like that .
no , it &apos;s -- it &apos;s okay .
i -- i kinda suspected the dates didn &apos;t line up .
now i &apos;m starting to think that wasn &apos;t
amelia earhart &apos;s compass .
i &apos;m so sorry , but i am sure that jay can help you two out .
no , no , no , no , no .
we want to do this on our own .
can i ask you a question ?
why are you having such a big thing anyway ?
well , because we &apos;re only getting married once .
i &apos;m just saying , why do you need to make into a spectacle ?
a s-- a spectacle ?
this could be the universe &apos;s way of telling you
to bring it down a notch .
invite your family , your friend pepper ,
and , what &apos;s his name , the -- the -- the flouncy one ?
uh , l &apos;david .
i don &apos;t have a flouncy friend named l &apos;david , dad .
do -- do you mean l &apos;michael or j &apos;marcus ?
i &apos;m not sure who you &apos;re referring to .
whatever .
i &apos;m just saying keep it small .
why pay all that money for people you barely know ?
oh , oh , you mean like any of your friends ?
oh , please , you don &apos;t want any of my friends there .
really ? because i &apos;ve --
i &apos;ve been asking for a list for months now .
so , so who doesn &apos;t want them there --
me or you ?
why are you getting upset ?
because , dad , if -- if this was claire &apos;s wedding ,
you would be all over it .
you &apos;d be wanting to have it at your club .
you &apos;d be inviting all your friends .
oh , please !
i wasn &apos;t that thrilled when claire got married , either .
&quot; either &quot; ? for god &apos;s sake , just stop talking .
everybody back off .
i don &apos;t think i &apos;m out of line
suggesting my friends don &apos;t want to see
a father @-@ son dance at a big gay wedding .
there is no father @-@ son dance , dad .
i don &apos;t know what things go on there .
do i walk you down the aisle ?
does someone throw a bouquet ?
i mean , i &apos;m just saying , i don &apos;t know
how this stuff plays out
with my guys from the club .
oh , you mean the guys who sit around the locker room
watching football naked ?
no ! no ! see , this -- this isn &apos;t about them .
this is about you .
you are the one that &apos;s uncomfortable here .
fine . i admit it .
this whole wedding thing is weird to me .
now , see , why do you get to be you ,
but i don &apos;t get to be me ?
see , i didn &apos;t choose to be uncomfortable .
深受广大同性恋的喜爱
i was born this way .
are you really throwing a gay anthem in our face right now ?
oh , damn it . give me some credit .
you know how far i &apos;ve come .
i mean , what more do you want from me ?
you know what , dad ? y @-@ you do .
you do get to be you .
if -- if it really makes you that uncomfortable , then ...
don &apos;t come to the wedding .
mitchell ...
no ! no , see ? we &apos;re scaling back already .
phil , honey ...
what happened down there ?
you attacked me .
in a fun way . we were both doing it .
i heard you this morning ,
talking about your super @-@ cute boyfriend bobby ,
saying that i was the &quot; comfortable &quot; choice ,
that you only married me because your dad hated it .
no , sweetheart .
i was not talking about you .
i was explaining to the girls
about an outfit that i was wearing in a picture
that was the comfortable choice
that my dad hated .
oh , honey .
you can &apos;t possibly think that &apos;s why i married you .
okay , i -- i get it a @-@ about your dad .
i -- i -- sometimes i do wonder , you know ,
if you hadn &apos;t gotten pregnant ...
would we even be here right now ?
yeah .
well , i wonder the same thing , too .
you do ?
yes . all the time .
just last week ,
you and the kids were outside washing the car ,
and you got in that soap battle
and everybody was running around laughing .
and i stood there at the kitchen window ,
and i was thinking how lucky i am .
&apos;cause i would have missed all of this
if i hadn &apos;t married you .
i knew you were watching .
that &apos;s why i dropped the sponge .
that &apos;s what got my attention in the first place .
you really don &apos;t regret not marrying bobby nash ?
no .
he was cute , but he was boring .
he never once made me laugh .
you laugh at me all the time .
i do .
i liked how happy you were
when you thought i was pregnant .
of course i was .
do you think you could pick that up for me ?
i don &apos;t know .
it &apos;s so far down here .
see ? i told you they were gonna be fine .
door lock !
run !
go ! go ! go ! go !
hey , phil , it &apos;s mitchell , claire &apos;s brother .
i heard about your and claire &apos;s whole pregnancy situation ,
and i &apos;m -- i &apos;m sorry my dad didn &apos;t have a better reaction .
don &apos;t take it personally .
he &apos;s just like that .
he &apos;ll -- he &apos;ll come around .
and if not ...
his loss .
yeah , okay , anyway ,
uh , now that we &apos;re gonna be family ,
it &apos;s -- it &apos;s probably a little weird for me to date your cousin ,
so maybe you could ask her to stop paging me ?
it &apos;s so crazy .
i know . uncle mitchell with a pager .
no , stella . okay ? no !
stella , i said no .
you ...
okay , but just this time , okay ?
and you keep your mouth shut about this .
