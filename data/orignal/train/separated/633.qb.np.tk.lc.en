my father was an innocent man ,
destroyed by powerful people .
the graysons are behind this ,
and they &apos;re gonna pay .
i &apos;ve dedicated my life to avenging his death .
eventually , someone &apos;s gonna find you out .
and i won &apos;t stop until they &apos;ve all paid the price .
you can &apos;t go in there !
i have to . jack &apos;s inside .
oh , god ! declan . oh , my god .
there was a bomb at grayson global .
i think conrad meant it for me .
i want to save you .
i can &apos;t just walk away ,
not now . maybe not ever .
certainly not for me .
where &apos;s my brother ?
he &apos;s gone , jack .
freeze ! fbi ! get on the ground .
nolan ross , you &apos;re under arrest .
nothing that &apos;s gonna keep me from making grayson
pay for what he &apos;s done .
jack , don &apos;t do it .
don &apos;t throw your life away because of the choices that i &apos;ve made .
what are you talking about ?
i &apos;m amanda clarke .
fear ...
it &apos;s a fire that burns from birth
in even the coldest heart .
it motivates and paralyzes the best of us ...
or is used as a weapon by the worst .
but when your path is one of treachery and deception ...
the greatest fear of all ...
is that the truth is absolute .
i &apos;m sorry .
afternoon , sunshine .
i hope this weather holds . it &apos;s beautiful .
well , it &apos;s never rained on a grayson memorial day kickoff .
i &apos;m not a grayson yet , daniel .
then why don &apos;t we finally set a date
to make you one ?
let &apos;s just get through tomorrow first , okay ?
you know , i still can &apos;t believe
you tried to engineer a family reunion .
too bad only half my family &apos;s gonna be there .
but aren &apos;t you the slightest bit curious
why we haven &apos;t heard from your mother these past six months ?
well , i can only hope after the way she left things with us ,
that she &apos;s in such a dark , lonely place ,
that we never hear from her again .
surprised you don &apos;t get thrown .
you &apos;re light as a feather .
oh , and you &apos;re constantly saying all the right things .
something the matter ?
i hope you understand that it &apos;s not a good idea for you
to be staying here while conrad returns .
here .
hey , don &apos;t need-- you don &apos;t have to put me up .
and you didn &apos;t have to stay with me these past six months .
i &apos;m so grateful that you did .
you know , i would have been happy to have you join me in the city .
i wasn &apos;t trying to hide you .
i just wanted to keep you all to myself .
charlotte .
oh , my , i wasn &apos;t expecting you for a couple of weeks .
well , apparently , we no longer own property in paris ,
which i loved discovering at 3 : 00 a. m. ,
after chartering a car from brussels .
darling , i &apos;m sorry nobody told you ,
but the european market is very strong right now .
as is your stableboy , it seems .
i know the past few months have been very difficult for you ,
losing declan and the baby ,
but i was hoping that graduating early
and going to europe would prove restorative .
or perhaps you &apos;re just suffering from jet lag .
maybe you should go home and lay down your head
and have a good bite to eat .
we &apos;ll discuss it later .
that &apos;s a lot of words for &quot; welcome home . &quot;
we still own the manor , right ?
only took ten years to return the favor .
i was kinda hoping you &apos;d have to repay this one never .
thanks for having them let me out of a side gate .
wasn &apos;t ready to face my fickle public yet .
well , i &apos;m glad you &apos;re back among the living , nolan .
took a lot longer than expected
for the fail @-@ safe i invented in carrion
to ferret out all the initiative numbers ,
exonerate me .
all that matters is that it did ,
and let &apos;s never say the words
&quot; carrion &quot; or &quot; initiative &quot; ever again .
amen to that .
speaking of ...
how go the rules of engagement ?
i &apos;m doing my best to avoid setting a date
while daniel looks for a job .
and i guess i can sympathize since , well ,
nolcorp has gone the way of the flip phone .
so ... what &apos;d i miss ?
jack was about to shoot conrad ?
yes , nolan .
i thought it was the right move to stop him .
all right , i know , but no , just going all birth name on him .
wait . you didn &apos;t tell him i was president of the inner circle , did you ?
i haven &apos;t seen him .
after declan &apos;s funeral , he packed up the stowaway
and left with carl .
i guess that &apos;s for the best .
i don &apos;t wanna risk losing one of the few friends i have left .
i &apos;m sorry , nolan .
you should never have been involved in my plans .
no dice , ems .
i will be by your side until we have taken down
everyone who wronged your father ...
and me .
especially if this is your new summer pad .
not mine .
for serious ?
if memory serves , i still owe you a house .
i guess sometimes payback &apos;s not a bitch .
although i imagine it will be
for new york &apos;s first and worst family .
what do you have on tap ?
a long summer of fun .
beginning with tomorrow &apos;s memorial day party ?
and if everything goes as planned ,
that &apos;ll be the last one the graysons ever attend .
revenge
one day before its debut ,
and you &apos;re still missing the depth in my eyes .
arctic pools , laila . arctic pools .
you know what ? uh ... give me a minute .
thank you .
finally achieving the immortality you &apos;ve always hoped for .
oh , no , my legacy lies in the work i &apos;m getting done .
it &apos;s a springboard both for the state &apos;s rehabilitation
and my ascension to the higher offices to which i &apos;m destined .
to that extent , i &apos;ve been going over the specs of the party
ms. thorne &apos;s been kind enough to throw in your mother &apos;s dormancy ,
and while security is acceptable for a typical hamptons hobnob ,
it &apos;s sorely inadequate for a future presidential candidate ,
so we will be adding handheld metal detectors
and x @-@ ray scanners at all the entrances .
is that why you called me here ?
to make me head of your security detail ?
i mean , i know i need a job , but i &apos;m not that desperate .
i didn &apos;t say you were .
this is a dossier for rice &amp; hawthorne ,
where a primo v. p. position awaits .
i said , dad , hedge funds aren &apos;t for me anymore ,
and neither are your connections .
it &apos;s time to make something of myself .
well , as long as it isn &apos;t kickstarting a poetry review .
oh , that &apos;d be my chief of staff ,
who worked at rice &amp; hawthorne , by the way .
scotty , what &apos;s the good word ?
there are much nicer places to get a drink .
some of them are even open .
just ... getting a little fresh air .
miles away from your penthouse
and the venue of the party that you didn &apos;t invite me to .
i &apos;m sorry , ashley . i didn &apos;t know you were in town .
knowledge is power , emily .
i thought you had power , ashley .
to pay me to forget about all the crap he &apos;s done .
but that well has dried up ,
and since there &apos;s no upside to me barking about it ,
i &apos;m coming to you .
for what ?
everything you have .
i saw that look in your eye the night of the election .
you weren &apos;t there to save conrad &apos;s life .
you were there to save jack &apos;s .
and since i know how you still feel about him ,
i will stop at nothing to expose you to the graysons
for the fraud you really are .
that &apos;s not how it happened , ashley .
and to be honest , you seem a little desperate .
i &apos;ll be at your party tomorrow ,
and you can introduce me to some men of standing .
sound like a plan ?
is that all ?
no . we &apos;re just getting started .
&quot; i want a virgin screwdriver . &quot;
margaux ?
i mess up one order when i &apos;m 14,
and you &apos;ll never let me live it down .
you seemed very happy with your orange juice .
such a nice surprise to see you .
how long has it been ?
oh , well , since before you knew how to properly ask for a drink .
light summer reading ?
yeah , i wish .
looking for my next career move .
i &apos;ve never understood how making money is a job description .
but of course , your kind are a necessary evil
as i &apos;m here to be ogled by yet another investor .
that could be &apos; cause you &apos;re not wearing a bra ...
or because boys never grow up .
you didn &apos;t catch me looking , did you ?
but you still noticed .
i &apos;m actually late .
but let &apos;s catch up tomorrow at your girlfriend &apos;s memorial day party .
you &apos;re coming ?
i try not to miss a chance to see american culture--
elusive as it is .
all right . well , i &apos;ll see you then .
yes .
all right .
uh , margaux ...
emily &apos;s not my girlfriend . she &apos;s my fiancee .
oh , my mistake .
i can never keep up .
emily ?
i saw the doors open . i was hoping you were home .
oh , my gosh . look at you . you look so different .
thank you . i like it .
and you &apos;ve obviously been in the city too long .
you &apos;re missing the most beautiful sunset .
i hope you didn &apos;t cut your trip short
just so you could make my memorial day party .
no , i &apos;m home because my lovely mother
has left me no other monetary option .
have you seen her ?
seen her ?
i almost caught lady chatterly with her lover .
her lover ?
more like boy toy , actually .
i think he &apos;s even staying at the house .
beautiful .
emily .
it &apos;s a shame you still feel the need to drop by unannounced .
had you called beforehand , i would have invited you to dinner .
i had the most marvelous salad of asparagus
i picked fresh from the garden this morning .
well , i &apos;m sorry i missed it .
well , i should box some for you ...
along with any animosity you and i may have shown each other .
let &apos;s allow the past to remain so , shall we ?
that &apos;s actually why i &apos;m here .
i haven &apos;t received your rsvp for tomorrow .
i &apos;m sure you know that we &apos;re unveiling your husband &apos;s portrait ,
and i worry that your absence will
send the wrong message .
oh , well , i have little concern of what people think of me at the moment .
well , then this probably won &apos;t matter to you either , but ...
i wanted to let you know i ran into ashley .
she told me you were having an affair .
and she &apos;s so desperate ,
she thought she &apos;d blackmail me to protect your secret .
and you came to warn me .
well , that &apos;s very kind .
well , suffice it to say ,
that her facts are as ill @-@ conceived as her intentions .
oh , i don &apos;t doubt that she &apos;s wrong , victoria .
but ...
i will say that you seem happy .
is it possible that
someone else has lifted your spirits ?
like ... patrick ?
oh , of all people , you see right through me .
yes . he showed up the night of conrad &apos;s election .
though i haven &apos;t laid eyes on him since he was 6 months old ,
i had no doubt that he was my firstborn .
he &apos;s changed my heart .
well , i should head back to the city ...
back to the man who changed mine .
i trust that you &apos;ll keep this information to yourself .
then i trust i &apos;ll see you tomorrow .
i think both you and i understand the importance
of protecting the sanctity of the family .
as much as we have to deal with those who won &apos;t .
bye .
well , i think she &apos;s gonna love meeting you , jorge .
okay . all right . i &apos;ll see you then . thanks . bye .
i didn &apos;t hear you get in last night .
i got a late start leaving the hamptons--
dropped in on your mom for a goodwill call .
yeah ? and how is the witch ?
she actually said she &apos;d come today .
really ? seems like we &apos;re all doing better apart than together .
it &apos;s been a long time , daniel . what could go wrong ?
you know , your rosy optimism
almost makes me forget my family fortune &apos;s been stolen ,
and i &apos;m unemployed .
look , we can worry about that tomorrow .
today , let &apos;s just relax and try to enjoy ourselves .
not if our esteemed governor has anything to say about it .
he &apos;s amping security-- x @-@ ray scanners , the whole line .
so make sure you &apos;re not sneaking in anything explosive .
ok .
claims it &apos;s &apos; cause he &apos;s entertaining a presidential run .
or his ego .
there &apos;s a difference ?
dad !
there &apos;s my little ...
woman , it would seem .
europe did wonders .
you would have loved it .
why don &apos;t you tell your overworked dad your favorite moment ?
that &apos;s easy .
i &apos;d just come out of the reina sofia ,
which was life @-@ changing .
and i see a newsstand selling the &quot; herald tribune &quot;
with you on the cover .
and i was so proud , i turned to the stranger next to me
and said , &quot; that &apos;s my dad . &quot;
you can &apos;t imagine what it feels like to hear that .
i &apos;m proud of you , too , kitten ,
especially after everything you &apos;ve been through .
charlotte ? you didn &apos;t tell me that we had a visitor .
if it isn &apos;t south hampton &apos;s most ravishing shut @-@ in .
it appears monastic life suits you , victoria .
so i imagine such anonymous contentment must seem odd
to a man who has to service ... 20 million people .
oh , you know , my constituents are clamoring for you , too , my dear .
that &apos;s a din i &apos;m prepared to quell .
as i &apos;m planning on coming to the unveiling today .
that &apos;s a timely change of heart .
may i presume that you &apos;ll also be representing my office in binghamton
for the transfer station opening next week ?
mm , baby steps , conrad .
i &apos;ll see you at the party , dad .
yeah .
look , i hope you can respect that i need to keep the trappings of this office
for as long as possible--
not only for the good i &apos;m doing ,
but lest you forget , it &apos;s our sole source of income .
oh , believe me . i would love nothing more
than to see you remain at the state house .
especially after the inexcusable things you did while living here .
yes , all in my endeavor to keep us alive--
a debt you can now repay by going to binghamton .
to christen a landfill ? i think not .
then you leave me with only one option .
and what &apos;s that ?
as of tomorrow , grayson manor is on the market .
conrad &apos;s increased security at every entrance .
and for what i &apos;m planning for the graysons ,
let &apos;s just say , i have to bring it in with me .
mm , so much for nesting .
i need you to hack this x @-@ ray machine .
cyber @-@ revenging has brought me nothing but trouble .
so for now , i &apos;m done with coding , camming ,
programming , and hacking .
i &apos;m nolan two point ... no .
but ... there may be a way .
how ?
trust me .
i always trust you , don &apos;t i ?
i &apos;ve got more unpacking to do .
fine .
and i &apos;m not the only one unpacking .
jack &apos;s back .
i hope you don &apos;t mind if i let myself in .
my family is paying for this suite , after all .
what are you doing here ?
exactly what i was going to ask you .
though i guess i know what you were doing at my house .
charlotte , you don &apos;t understand .
and when i tell my father about you ,
he &apos;ll squash you like a bug .
your father knows i exist .
who the hell do you think you are ?
i &apos;m your brother .
what ?
patrick . i &apos;m your brother .
well , i guess it &apos;s typical .
daniel and i go away for a couple of months ,
and my mother buys our replacement .
and i &apos;m sorry you have such a low opinion of your mother .
she &apos;s been nothing but gracious , generous , kind .
well , if you think you &apos;re just gonna
enjoy the perks without the misery ,
you &apos;re wrong .
my mother will draw you in and destroy you .
it &apos;s what she does .
and if she doesn &apos;t , i will .
charlotte .
jack ?
you want a drink ?
no , thanks .
i want a drink .
i &apos;m glad you &apos;re back .
where you been ?
i was introducing my son to his extended family .
how is carl ?
he &apos;s good .
i am so sorry that i lied to you--
that i didn &apos;t tell you the truth in the first place .
i ...
i know .
well , i think about all the opportunities you had to tell me ,
that night under the fireworks ,
the night sammy died .
i wanted to .
but you didn &apos;t .
so i ask myself why--
why was this so important to you ?
then a couple weeks ago , i ...
i was leaving my uncle &apos;s place in pittsburgh ,
and carl was asleep in the back .
i looked in the rearview , and ...
just as he was waking up , his eyes caught mine .
and ...
he just sprang to life .
and in that moment , i saw ...
the love that a child has for their father .
and i understood ...
why you &apos;re doing what you &apos;re doing .
and why you told me when you did--
to save me .
i didn &apos;t know how i felt about you till this moment .
and i &apos;m sorry .
i just don &apos;t feel anything .
i &apos;ll keep your secret ...
but it &apos;s just me and carl now .
leave us alone .
oh , you know , it was so strange coming downstairs this morning
and not seeing you at breakfast .
and obviously , you felt the same
since you asked me to pop by .
and i could use a happy moment .
you look--well , you look incredible .
oh , it &apos;s just something i threw together
for emily &apos;s party this afternoon .
what &apos;s this ?
that &apos;s actually-- that &apos;s why i called .
um , i can only consider myself a freelancer
if i actually paint on occasion .
so , um , i &apos;m going back home to the city .
so you &apos;re leaving me ?
or was that your plan all along ?
drawing me in ,
then abandon me as payback for my transgressions ?
no .
i don &apos;t even know what kind of person would do that . i--
then what happened ?
did someone say something ?
it &apos;s just time .
time for both of us .
and , um ...
i &apos;ll be in touch . i promise .
bye .
can you believe it &apos;s been two years since we met ?
gosh , it feels like so much longer .
can i get you something ?
uh , just water would be great .
all right . i &apos;ll see you in a bit .
thanks .
no , no , no !
don &apos;t tell me you &apos;ve stopped drinking now .
oh , come on . you know me better than that .
it &apos;s for emily .
your fiancee , right ?
ashley .
welcome . that &apos;s a bold move--
taking this tradition from the sea to the land .
well , people feel less like prisoners
when they have the option to leave .
trust me , i &apos;m staying .
dr. velez .
you must be ashley .
jorge velez .
charmed .
we met at an alzheimer &apos;s benefit .
i thought you two might hit it off .
oh , um , if you &apos;ll excuse me .
sure .
i &apos;m so happy you could all make it .
emily .
thank you for picking up the mantle
and launching the season off in style .
i hope you say a few words after my dedication today .
oh , i , uh , you know ,
i may have prepared a little something .
and you , too , victoria ?
oh , i don &apos;t want to take the spotlight
on what &apos;s essentially your coming out party .
well , after a 6 @-@ month absence ,
i daresay it &apos;s also yours , my dear .
yeah , they &apos;d all love to hear what you &apos;ve been up to .
trust me , i have very little of interest to say .
it doesn &apos;t look like ashley has that problem .
i &apos;m going to go look for daniel .
governor grayson .
oh . good to see you .
great to see you .
daniel ... your family arrived .
huh , i didn &apos;t think you could pull it off ,
but the gang &apos;s all here .
em , i &apos;d like for you to meet margaux lemarchal .
oh , pascal lemarchal &apos;s daughter . enchantee .
i &apos;m a huge fan of all of his publications--
especially &quot; voulez . &quot;
oh , that &apos;s why i &apos;ve moved here--
to start the american version .
a new magazine in the digital age ?
even with a strong brand behind it ,
it &apos;s not an easy prospect .
which is why i &apos;m doing it against pascal &apos;s wishes .
sometimes it needs crossing an ocean
to get out of a father &apos;s shadow .
and what do you do ?
i mean , besides throw lovely parties .
well , i work for a lot of different charities ,
making sure people get what they deserve .
notify security .
excuse me .
hold it right there . hold it right there .
what the hell are you doing , nolan ?
i meant to , uh , r.s.v.p. , but , uh ...
was unceremoniously detained .
you could have been shot , mr. ross .
beats waiting for a death sentence , governor .
keep an eye on him .
you look piqued , conrad .
i cannot suffer any more bad press
due to that fool .
well , let &apos;s get straight to the unveiling .
refocus the crowd .
that &apos;s a good idea .
today we unveil the portrait
that will serve as a remembrance
for all of the good that you &apos;ve done for generations to come .
ladies and gentlemen , i give you ...
governor conrad grayson .
well , first of all , i would like to offer each and
every one of you the warmest of welcomes from this lovely location .
and from the office ...
i &apos;m -- i &apos;m sorry .
we , uh ...
damn it , what is that ? um ...
please step back . it &apos;s okay .
the press is getting antsy .
someone should probably make a statement .
maybe we should wait until we have something to say .
i was concerned after your syncope
that your collapse may have been something hypoperfusive .
so i ran a full panel .
and it came back with a c.a.g. score of 48 .
i &apos;m afraid you have huntington &apos;s disease , governor .
what is that ?
it &apos;s a neurological disease where one slowly starts
to lose motor skills and mental acuity .
it &apos;s progressive .
and it &apos;s fatal ?
no .
uh , you need to get tested , son . it &apos;s genetic .
how ... rapid is the onset ?
depends on the patient .
you have a high @-@ stress job , governor .
nonsense .
my grandfather worked until retirement with this disease .
you need to consider your options .
say nothing , conrad ,
until we know what to do .
not even to your staff .
daniel ... brief the press .
my father will be fine .
he &apos;s suffering from severe dehydration ,
but he &apos;ll be back on his feet in 24 hours ,
so that &apos;s all i got to say .
sorry , ma &apos;am--
no , he knows me .
yeah , she &apos;s good .
okay , go ahead .
i do hope your father will be okay .
ah , our fathers are nothing if not survivors .
i can see your worry .
but a colleague in paris has huntington &apos;s ,
and he &apos;s doing well , so i know conrad can fight this .
how -- how do you know what my dad has ?
um , well , i received a news alert as i walked up ...
quoting a source close to the family ,
which i assumed was you .
excuse me . i &apos;m sorry .
oh , victoria .
patrick &apos;s left me .
conrad &apos;s dying , and now ... daniel may have it .
you know , all was good for a while .
now it &apos;s being torn away ,
and i just have to sit here and take it .
well , sometimes forces beyond our control
can change everything .
we &apos;ll get through this ...
together .
dad &apos;s diagnosis is out there .
what ?
apparently someone &quot; close to the family &quot; went to the press .
i hate to say it ,
but with conrad &apos;s condition being public knowledge ...
he has to step down .
i &apos;m gonna go talk to him .
who knew besides us ?
only dr. velez .
but i can &apos;t believe that
he would destroy his career over this .
unless he was a little too candid
with someone he &apos;s interested in .
and since ashley wants money ,
i &apos;m sure she netted a handsome payday
by selling her story to the press .
you &apos;re responsible
for what happened to conrad today , aren &apos;t you ?
he had no right being governor in the first place .
so you almost kill him ?
isn &apos;t that exactly what you were stopping me from doing ?
i &apos;m not killing anybody , jack ,
but i will let them suffer .
these are terrible people doing terrible things .
this is what they deserve .
did amanda get what she deserved ?
did declan ?
will i , once the graysons start connecting dots ?
&apos;cause they know what amanda clarke
was trying to do to them .
they just killed the wrong girl .
yeah , you &apos;re right .
finish this by the end of the summer ,
then leave for good .
or i &apos;ll tell everyone the truth .
ashley .
i thought conrad asked for me .
well , one of your many misconceptions , miss davenport .
emily told me about your pathetic attempt to blackmail her
and your vendetta against our family .
i thought you might like to explain it yourself .
well , emily obviously didn &apos;t tell you the full story ,
like the fact that jack porter
tried to assassinate your husband
the night he got elected .
and who do you think gave him the gun ?
well , i also know that conrad planted that bomb
at grayson global and led jack there to die .
with a text message sent from your phone .
i hope you didn &apos;t use your phone this time
to sell conrad &apos;s story to the media .
i did no such thing .
what you &apos;ve done is try to sleep your way to the top
after failing at a myriad of jobs
we gave you out of pity .
well , at least i tried to work for it
as opposed to having everything handed to me .
that &apos;s funny . it seems as though you want me
to hand everything to you .
conrad &apos;s last act in office
was to requisition your cell records .
that prove , in fact ,
that you attempted to lure jack to his death .
get on that plane . go back to croydon .
we &apos;ll bury the information .
sound like a plan ?
you two are evil .
what we are , like it or not , is family .
i &apos;ve been reading about this disease .
paranoia . facial tremors .
loss of judgment .
memory .
my dad &apos;s in for some ... seriously rough waters
until , uh ...
until he ...
then let &apos;s get married
before the end of the summer .
for my dad &apos;s sake .
yeah .
that means a lot .
you got a date in mind ?
how about august 8th ?
i know it sounds silly , but ever since i was a kid ,
i ... always imagined something wonderful
would happen on that day .
and now something will .
i &apos;m gonna go for a swim to clear my head ,
but let your family know .
at least something good happened today .
what are you doing ?
waiting for your father to come home .
i still can &apos;t believe it .
so are you gonna put dad in patrick &apos;s room ?
assuming your son will keep staying at the south fork .
it really was such a lovely way to meet my brother .
i hope i didn &apos;t scare him off .
how dare you , coming back here as if you run things ?
you have no idea what you &apos;ve done .
since you &apos;re obviously much happier with your other children ,
i &apos;m moving out .
fine .
婚礼打算在8月8日举行
given the turn of events ,
i assume you &apos;ll keep my house off the market .
don &apos;t worry , victoria .
neither of us is going anywhere .
and here ...
is to buying me a house ...
just down the beach from you .
away from the prying eyes of victoria on her cupola ,
where i could never do this .
so ... ashley &apos;s been ... daven @-@ deported ?
guess that &apos;s what happens when you get two takedowns for the price of one .
which i couldn &apos;t have done without you .
what happens next ?
jack came to see me .
gave me an ultimatum .
well , that &apos;s heavy .
what are you gonna do ?
have the wedding of the century .
take down victoria once and for all .
when &apos;s the big date ?
august 8th .
a fitting end ...
to a path of revenge .
fear is the most primal of emotions .
it can linger as a memory
burned into one &apos;s mind of a parent taken too soon .
or burrow into one &apos;s soul as self @-@ doubt
over a child &apos;s rejection .
but the one thing we all fear the most ...
is the unknown .
patrick .
what are you doing here ?
same thing as you .
looking to destroy the girl next door .
