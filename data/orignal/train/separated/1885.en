I had this memory game when I was a kid,
a bunch of cards facedown in rows.
Each card has a picture.
You turn one over, look at it...
Then you turn it back over.
Then you have to try and remember
where its matching card was.
I have to get on a plane. I have to get on a plane.
Dr. Grey, Dr. Grey, you were on a plane.
You were in a plane crash. Can you tell me what you--
Derek!
Meredith, get up!
Sometimes you have no idea.
Where--where's my sister?
My sister-- where is Lexie?
No, no, no, no.
Where--where--where's my husband and--and--and Cristina?
Lay back and relax.
I have to get--
All right.
I have to get to my sister and my husband.
All right. Hold on. Hold on.
I--my sister.
Hey, you can't go in there.
Don't tell me where I can go.
...there's an infection and I need to see him.
And other times, it shows us exactly what we need to see.
Doctor, we've got them. We're taking care of them.
That's your mama.
Hey, honey.
You sit here. Mama's here, baby.
Mama's here.
The cards seem completely out of order and random,
but you keep turning them over.
And the more cards you see...
you get a sense of how everything fits together.
They're taking us home tomorrow on a plane.
And I said no planes, but we don't have a choice,
because of Mark and Arizona, so...
So I told Bailey to just sedate us--
Sedate all of us.
And we'll never know it happened.
Right?
Cristina?
Cristina?
I wish they had put me out, too.
Yeah, I know what you mean.
All I keep thinking is,
we're gonna crash on some tropical island
and get attacked by a polar bear.
Now... I don't know what you mean.
You should watch more TV.
I don't even know how you can think of leaving.
Because it's Harvard.
Meredith, because you don't turn down an offer from Harvard.
You have two,
maybe three surgeries left on your hand before--
You know what? Maybe they have doctors there.
Maybe one can help me.
With Mark in the condition he's in, and Cristina?
I'm not saying we leave tomorrow.
They're just looking for a time frame.
Well, I'm sorry, Derek.
I know you really want to go. But I can't even think about it.
This is not about me. This is about you.
You're at the beginning of your career.
It's you they want.
I don't know. I'm not the same man that they hired.
Don't say that.
80%, Meredith.
Don't say that!
We stay here, we work here,
we move into that beautiful house that you built us.
That was our plan.
That was before you got a job in Boston.
And that was before our plane crashed.
Mm. Blowing off Harvard. Wow.
You're blowing off Hopkins. Wow.
No, I'm postponing Hopkins till Robbins is better.
Avery did the same thing for Sloan.
And I stayed.
And you stayed because you have no place else to go.
Oh. Wake me up in ten for Chunky Stu.
You just ate.
Stuart. Short-bowel syndrome kid.
I'm doing an intestinal transplant.
He puked on me the first time we met,
so I call him "Chunky stu."
Arizona hated it,
but Stuart thinks it's hilarious.
How is Arizona's infection? Is it getting any better?
Don't know. I haven't seen her.
What do you mean? You're running her service.
You really think she wants to talk to me?
I mean, what am I supposed to say to her--
"Hey, remember the time that I quit
"And you got pissed "And took my seat on a plane that crashed,
"And now you're trading in your wheelie sneaks for a peg leg?
Sorry. My bad"?
How are we doing here?
Hey, Jackson, you're talking to Sloan, right?
Keeping him updated.
Yeah. Not about work stuff, though.
He doesn't need that kind of pressure right now.
What is wrong with you two?
I just said that--
No, I'm just saying, they're fine. They're gonna be fine.
Arizona's not gonna lose her leg,
and Sloan is coming back.
They're coming back.
So let's act like it.
They're gonna be fine.
We're all going to be fine.
How long are we saying that this is okay?
As long as she needs.
I, for one, find it refreshing.
They say, if you don't have something nice to say...
She never has anything nice to say.
Come on, Yang. I'm wide open. Just hit me.
I said no more damn restraints!
Look, she is clearly a danger.
She doesn't even belong on this floor.
She is violent, uncommunicative, and I'm worried--
Oh, she communicated. She just hasn't talked yet.
Look, there is nothing physically wrong with her.
She belongs up in psych.
I am the chief of surgery and her husband.
Don't tell me where she belongs.
Well, with all due respect, sir,
that is exactly why you shouldn't be making this decision.
Okay.
Okay. It's time.
It's time to get up.
They are gonna take you upstairs
and they're gonna pump you full of antipsychotics.
And you're gonna go slack-jawed and cuckoo's nest.
And you'll never be you again.
Cristina, please, I am begging you. Please.
You have to say something.
Cristina, please.
Do you hear me?
Say something, please.
不忘往昔
Derek, you are gonna be just fine.
How salvageable is that hand, you think...
I'm a surgeon.
What was that? Did you get that?
No.
It's all right.
We're gonna take good care of you.
There was damage to the second metacarpal,
but the first M.C.P. joint was completely crushed,
so at Boise did an x-fix.
I revised it to an internal fixator.
And then I removed a lot of scar tissue
so there wouldn't be contractures.
Smart.
Oh, thank you. Thanks.
Did you see how I, uh--
No, no, your work is--is great.
Um, Derek, it's the, um, nerve damage
that I'll concern myself with.
And it looks like a pretty easy fix.
You know, that'll get you your prehensile strength back.
That'll get you this back.
Which will get me back into the O.R.
That's... the hope.
Well, that's the point, isn't it?
Of course.
But your hand was badly damaged.
And I think conservatively,
I can get you back to 80% function.
Meredith, I can teach,
consult.
I just may never do another surgery.
Oh, don't talk like that.
Meredith...
I'm alive.
We survived.
Zola has both her parents.
I know.
That's enough.
Meningioma. Patient is female, 44 years old.
It's a tricky spot.
It's right up against the sagittal sinus.
Which is why I suggested Dr. Ramsey see what you might do.
No radiosurgery. I'd cut it out.
Right, but with two draining veins in the way,
it might be safer to see how she responds--
This woman's gonna live for another 40 years.
The tumor can recur too easily.
You need to dissect the two draining veins clear
and approach it from this direction.
You get it all, she's cured.
Well, that's much sexier, isn't it?
That's why we keep him around.
Thanks, Shepherd. I'd be happy to have you join me...
or if you'd like to observe.
I, um... probably have a class to teach.
Good luck.
She's right.
You're invaluable.
Great.
Oh, hey, Dr. Shepherd. This is pretty cool.
Dr. Ramsey's got a meningioma invading the sagittal sinus.
She was gonna do it radiosurgically
but decided to go after the whole thing.
Oh, is that so?
Yeah. She just freed the first draining vein.
Yeah, I got it, Ross. Thanks.
There's bleeding on the sinus.
Suction.
Cottonoids.
Okay, let's put the head of the table up.
No, no, no, no. Get the head down.
B.P. is 90 over 50.
CO₂ is down to 22.
All right, get the head down. Move it down.
She's sucking in air. You have an air embolus.
Boki, bulb irrigate the field.
Make sure no more air gets in there. Seal it off.
Thank you, Dr. Shepherd. That was, uh--
All right, you have a hole in the sinus you need to take care of.
Yes, yes.
You have to carefully reapproximate the edges of the patch graft.
I'll just seal it with a clip.
No, don't. That could occlude the sinus.
There. See? Bleeding stopped.
Oh, B.P.'s 210 over 130.
Venous infarction. Ventriculostomy tube now.
She's coding.
It's not your fault.
You didn't force her to try your approach.
If she couldn't pull it off, well, then--
I could've pulled it off had I been in there.
Well, you'll be back in there.
No, I won't.
I will be the former neurosurgeon
Derek Shepherd, research librarian.
Shut up.
Mark, the guy gave me 80%.
Well, get back to 100%.
It's not gonna happen.
Don't give me that crap. You love a hopeless case.
It's true. It's the only reason we're still friends.
I'm glad you're doing better.
Me too.
You will be, too.
100%, you'll see.
Yeah, coming along.
X-ray shows excellent alignment.
I hear Schachter moved your surgery up.
Yeah, couple days.
Well, fingers crossed. Oh.
Ohh, sorry.
That was...
No, it's okay. It's fine. I get it.
So I had a look at, uh, Schachter's plan.
He's opted for an end-to-end repair.
What'd you think?
It's good.
Oh, it's great. He's amazing.
He's the best, right?
But?
But nothing.
It's just that I've-- I've been in there.
I've seen the amount of gap in the nerve,
and I know it's messier,
but I thought a nerve graft might be better.
That's all.
I'm sure he's--he's thought of it already.
Uh, he's the best.
Well, that would be--
Be much riskier. You're right, it is.
But it could mean a full recovery.
You could use your own A.I.N. for the graft.
I've used it before.
It's practically gift-wrapped for a median nerve graft.
Yeah, but if the graft doesn't take,
we shorten the nerve more.
I could lose more function than I have now.
You're right. It's stupid.
That's why Schachter's not doing it.
He's smart not to...
Which is why you should.
What?
I want you to do the surgery.
No.
No.
Okay, graft, please.
Perfect.
This looks...
perfect.
It's Arizona. There's a problem.
Watch that line. Hold her. Get some restraints.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Somebody--ow! Damn it!
All right, I got it. I've got it.
2 of lorazepam now! Now! There's the restraints.
Calm down. Easy.
Calm down. Okay. Okay.
The combination of extreme exhaustion, dehydration, and exposure
seems to have put her in a state.
What do you mean?
We think it's reactive psychosis.
She's unresponsive,
and then when we go to examine her,
She becomes... violent.
I'm here, okay?
I wouldn't do that.
It's all right.
All right. All right. All right.
Cristina. I'm gonna help you.
Cristina, I am gonna help you. I'm gonna help you.
I'm here. Cristina, I'm here. I'm here.
Cristina, I'm here now.
It's okay. I'm gonna help you.
So she doesn't speak at all?
She hasn't yet.
She just stares...
and breathes.
It's kind of weird,
but the way that they talk about her around here,
it's like she's a legend, you know?
Mm. And now she's like an end table.
Shane, that's horrible. Stop it.
Sorry.
I'm gonna take a leave of absence.
I think three years ago, I said I was gonna figure out
how to make a great roast chicken.
Still haven't done it.
I just like how a house smells when there's a chicken in the oven.
You're gonna feel stronger in a couple of days
or weeks.
It takes as long as it takes.
And we have all the time in the world.
When you're back on your feet, you'll go back to work
at whatever pace you want.
You'll go back into the O.R., and you can do your magic.
You won't have to deal with patients or families.
I'll take care of all of that.
You ready to get out now?
I can't.
What?
I can't get out.
Are you...
You can. I'll... I'll help you.
I stayed awake for four days.
I remember...
every single minute of those four days.
The fire went out.
It was really, really dark.
There were so many stars.
I remember getting the bugs out of Arizona's leg.
I put leaves on it, trying to keep them out.
And Mark...
Mark just kept dying.
It was so annoying.
I kept trying to help him,
but he just kept trying to die on me.
I just wanted to lie down...
and sleep on him because he was warm.
And I wanted to sleep.
Meredith was asleep.
Everyone was asleep.
Arizona got the last of the water,
and I remember drinking something bad.
It might have been the fuel from the plane?
I drank...
my pee.
The noises...
the animal noises...
fighting and growling right...
next to us, right there.
I kept waiting for them to come and kill me,
but they didn't.
And then I realized...
they were fighting over Lexie.
I tried to keep them off of her.
I tried.
But I couldn't get out.
I can't get out.
You're out now.
I've got you.
You hear me?
I can't get out.
Don't you see?
I'll never get out.
You okay?
Yep.
You sure you know what you're doing?
Yes. It's one highway all the way to Minnesota...
through Montana, cross one of the Dakotas,
I can't remember which.
No, I meant by leaving.
Are you sure you're okay with it?
Are you sure it's the right thing to do?
Meredith, not you, too.
Owen just tried to...
Well, yeah, because I'm worried that you're just running away.
Well, yeah, I am. I'm fleeing,
like Bambi from a forest fire,
and so should you, 'cause horrible things happen here.
No, something horrible happened,
and we should stick together.
You know what? We have stuck together.
And we've grown together, like two gnarled trees
twining around each other, trying to survive.
Survive what? Cristina, this is life.
Bad things happen. It's hard.
You find your people,
you find your person, and you lean on them.
Oh, god love you, Mer.
You know, so many horrible things have happened to you,
and maybe you're okay with it,
but you shouldn't be.
Go to Harvard,
anywhere except here,
seeing your dead sister around every corner.
Hey, your mother died here. Your husband was shot here.
George died here.
It's my life, and you were here for it, too.
I mean, now you sound like the same scary loner bitch
who rode in here on a motorcycle five years ago.
Like the past five years has never happened?
Well, you know, a part of me wishes it hadn't.
Oh, okay. Well, then you should just go then.
And you should not look back. Go.
Meredith...
No, you know, Cristina, you're right. I'm not your person.
And owen isn't your person.
Your person is you, and it always has been.
What the hell did they do to this guy out there?
Hold my hand.
He's bradying down.
Yeah, I got a pulse.
Clear.
I flew to Boise.
I-I was there, but they wouldn't let me in.
They said I wasn't family.
It's not fair.
You don't deserve...
You deserve better.
Shh. Stop it.
I'm here.
I'm not going anywhere, Mark.
I love you.
I love Lexie.
Loved.
I'm sorry.
Callie.
Callie.
Go home.
No, I'm all right.
No, you're not.
You've been up for the past two nights
bouncing between Arizona's room and here.
I just need some coffee. Can you, um...
Can you stay with him while I run to the cafeteria?
I'll stay with him all night.
I just feel like we're losing him, Derek.
Usually when I talk to him, I sense that he's there,
that he's listening, but I think he's giving up.
I'm so scared,
the second I leave this hospital,
I'm gonna get a phone call that he's dead.
That's not gonna happen tonight.
Promise?
If he starts going south, I'll tell him to cut it out.
He idolizes me. Mm.
He'll do whatever I say.
Thank you.
You heard what I told her.
Don't make me look like an ass.
Pull it together.
A lot of people counting on you.
Damn it. I knew I shouldn't have gone home.
Is he okay? Did he code?
Just come see.
Oh, god. Where the hell is Shepherd?
Avery, tell me what's going on.
Torres.
Where you been?
Pretty amazing recovery, right?
Yeah, his SATs are good
He's being weaned off pressors.
Yeah, B.P. is 110 over 60.
And he's making inappropriate sexual comments to Brooks.
It's fine.
No, it's--it's not.
But, uh, right now I'm really, really enjoying it, so...
You think it's the surge.
Mm. It--it might be.
I don't. I don't think it is.
What's the surge?
In many terminally ill patients,
they have a final surge of energy.
They get better before they get worse.
But this is not that.
But in a little while, he'll do what all patients do.
He'll have epiphanies,
He'll tell you what really matters in life,
ask for his family.
The man is telling dirty jokes. It's not a--not a surge.
No, I don't think so either.
Uh, I have a facial lac.
Uh, oh, I had a consult this morning--
breast augmentation, "B" to "D."
Did you tell her her breasts were beautiful the way they are?
No, I still think that's weird.
Well, I know you do, but you're wrong.
You tell her she's beautiful just the way she is,
and if she believes you,
you've saved someone
an unnecessary surgical procedure.
And that is definitely not how I talk to patient.
No, but it's how you talk to a woman, Avery.
We're in the business
of making people feel better about themselves.
Again, sometimes when you talk,
I feel like a male prostitute.
She's a person on the precipice of change, Avery.
She's scared and she's worried.
God, the things we worry about.
So pointless.
And we get to help take that worry away.
It's why we're doctors.
It's actually why we're people,
but somehow we forget that all that matters is people.
And whether we walk away leaving them better
or worse for having met us.
We control that, Avery.
I want you to promise me something.
If you love someone,
you tell 'em.
Eeven if you're scared that it's not the right thing.
Eeven if you're scared that it'll cause problems.
Even if you're scared
that it will burn your life to the ground,
you say it, and you say it loud.
And then you go from there.
Hey, where's my kid? I want to see Sofia.
Avery, why don't you run up to day care
and bring her down here?
I can't bring a baby in the I.C.U.
No, but you can sneak one in.
Come on, Avery. Grow a pair.
You know what? Forget it. I'll do it.
Whoa, no, no, no. All right. I'll get her.
I'll get her.
Yes!
My man!
Is this what I think it is?
There's no way to know.
We'll just... take it as it comes.
Okay?
Um, can we talk? I'm leaving.
No. Actually, I've gotta grab Sofia for Sloan.
He needs to see her.
But I can, uh, call you later.
Uh, no, Jackson. I'm--I'm leaving...
for home--Moline.
My flight's in a few hours.
What do you...
I...I don't have a job here anymore.
My contract actually ended a few days ago,
but I stuck around, waiting for Sloan to get better,
and he's better, so...
All right, I've gotta get Sofia right now, okay?
But can you just wait?
Just wait for me at Joe's.
We can have a drink, we can talk.
Just... okay? Just wait for me at Joe's.
Don't tell Callie.
She's about to operate on Derek.
Okay.
Derek doesn't need to go in this surgery worried,
so don't say anything to him.
They can reschedule the surgery, Mark.
I'm sure they'd want to.
No.
That surgery's gonna get Derek back into the O.R.
where he belongs.
Nobody's got better hands than him,
except maybe Callie.
Have you looked at her hands? They're beautiful.
Sofia has her hands.
Callie...
really doesn't even know how good she is.
Sometimes you wish people...
would just see themselves the way you do.
Listen to me,
this the surge talking?
No, this is you.
This is all you.
So keep going...
'cause I'm not going anywhere.
The extensive bone injury
along with the degree of soft-tissue infection
is... troubling.
No matter what we do, it's--
If the infection goes to the bone,
it'll be hard to treat.
And eventually, you're looking at bone loss.
I'm gonna have to say...
Officially, I'm recommending amputation.
Show me those.
Show them to me.
I withhold consent.
I withhold consent.
Before you drug me or sedate me,
I give n-nobody permission to cut off my leg.
And certainly not some yahoo in dump truck, Idaho.
I want to go home to Callie.
She'll know what to do.
Just take me home.
How's that? Mm. Yeah.
Does that feel all right? Does that hurt?
It doesn't hurt.
And anything that doesn't hurt feels good.
Thanks.
Is the infection better or worse?
Don't worry about that right now, okay?
Just... try to feel good.
Uh, sorry I haven't been around.
I, uh, just wanted to let you know
that I gave, uh, Chunky Stu--
Uh, sorry, Stuart, his intestinal transplant today.
It went great. He's-- he's responding well. Oh.
Uh, and I know that you like to do that thing
where you bring him his favorite food
in a couple of months when he can handle solids,
So it's, uh, it's Hawaiian pizza,
I just thought I should tell you.
Thank you.
I feel like crap.
It should've been me on that plane.
If I could trade places with you, I would--
I would let you.
I had that thought a lot, too.
And I didn't like myself for it,
but I did.
I kept thinking about my wife and baby,
and how you had no wife and no baby,
you had no one.
I only went on that plane because I was pissed at you.
So I kept wondering...
I'm only here because he's so selfish and thoughtless.
And no matter how hard I tried to make him better,
he's still a horrible person.
So now...
I keep wondering...
Why this would happen to someone like me,
instead of someone like you?
So I guess I'm still pretty pissed off.
Would you get out of my room,
please?
Hey. Look who's here.
Hey. We just had lunch,
and now it's back to the crayon mines for her.
Bye, baby. I'll see you tonight.
You need to take her to the park more.
She goes from that apartment to the day care.
She's indoors all day.
Okay.
Yeah. We should...we should get a house.
Slow down.
Then she could have a yard and she doesn't...
Have to be inside...
all the time.
Hey. What's wrong?
Do we have a plan yet?
Do we?
We are waiting for the infection to improve,
and then we will know what options we have.
Well, if the vancomycin isn't working,
then put me on colistin. It'll be stronger.
I understand that it's hard to just...
No, you don't.
You don't, because you know what your life is going to be.
You know if you're going to...take her to the park
or if you're gonna stand at an O.R. table again.
You will.
Of course you will.
I know. I know what my options are!
And the longer we wait,
the more that my vascularity diminishes,
the more the nerves die, the more the muscle atrophies,
and then there's only one option left!
Okay, we are so far from that happening.
Do something, Callie!
You need to do something.
Please. Please don't give up on...on me.
Arizona, I'm not.
Promise...promise me...
I...
You won't let them take my leg.
I promise.
I do. I promise, okay? I promise you.
It's okay.
This is a good plan.
You're not her doctor.
Oh, I'm not saying I'll do the surgery.
Carlson can do it.
There is a real possibility she may lose her leg.
You need to help her prepare for that.
No, no! No.
An intramedullary nailing can save the leg.
Define "Save"?
Her leg will never be the same.
A prosthetic can give Arizona a better quality of life
than years of rehab and chronic pain.
I don't need to tell you this.
No, in fact, it's pretty condescending.
Or the surgery will make her infection worse
and increase her risk of D.V.T.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's her leg.
I'm risking it. I am doing it.
You are not doing anything.
She is your wife, not your patient.
She's not, though. She's not my wife!
I...
I don't know who she is.
Did this happen with Cristina?
It's like you're looking at her, but there's nothing inside?
I feel like she's just this shell.
All the Arizona's been scooped out...
And she's just this shell now,
and I want her back.
And I don't think I'll ever get her back
if we cut off that leg,
so I'm going to save it.
I've made a plan to save it, and you're gonna get on board.
And then we'll work out a plan to get Cristina back,
but you need to help me now.
I don't think I'm ever gonna get Cristina back.
You gonna use a free flap to cover the open fracture site?
Yeah.
Where are you thinking about pulling it from?
There we go.
That's from Mark. He's still doing great.
He said to tell you good luck tomorrow.
Hey, it's still way down. Oh.
Looks good.
And I haven't eaten since breakfast.
Okay, your surgery's not till noon tomorrow.
Carlson doesn't care if you eat now.
Well, I'm just...I'm gonna be an unbelievably good patient.
Oh. Okay.
I have to go.
'cause you're an unbelievably good doctor.
Say more.
Come here.
My wife is the doctor that's going to fix
Derek Shepherd's million-dollar hand.
She's that good.
Okay, stop. You're freaking me out now.
You...
are outstanding.
And I love you.
I love you, too.
I, uh, brought you a piece of Chunky Stu's pizza.
He, uh, he's eating tonight, thanks to you...
Us.
He's out of the woods, so...
I'm out of here.
I'm going to Hopkins.
I've really, uh, been busting my ass
to make sure everything's run smoothly,
And, uh, now I'm...I'm done.
So just...
Good-bye.
I'm sorry this happened to you
and I'm sorry that it made you hate me.
It's Arizona. There's a problem.
What?
She's crashing.
Crashing? She's--
Temp's 104, serum lactate is 6.
She's in septic shock.
Shut up. Shut up. Shut up.
Uh, do you have her on pressors?
I've got her on pressors, triple antibiotics.
I've got her on aggressive I.V. fluids.
Did you give her supplemental oxygen?
I intubated her. She's crashing.
Do you...
Uh, did you start her on hy-hydrocortisone?
Yeah.
Um... do you have her on pressors?
Yes, I told you. Yes.
Look, she's still deteriorating.
She's dying.
It's the leg.
It's the leg.
Cut it off.
Go. Just do a good job, please. Do your best.
Callie, what do you need? What can I do?
Nothing. I'm fine.
I'm fine, really.
I know.
"In the event that my heart stops beating
and I stop breathing, I want to be resuscitated."
Well, don't go crazy, but...
if you can get me back, yeah, get me back.
Initial here.
"In the event that I am close to death
"and life support would only postpone
"that moment of my death,
"I, 'a'--want to receive tube feeding,
"'b'--I want tube feeding only as my physician recommends,
"and 'c'...
I do not want tube feeding."
Initial one.
This section specifies a time of withdrawal of care.
"Life-sustaining care shall be withdrawn
if signs of recovery are not seen after a period of..."
30 days.
You've reached Cristina Yang. Leave a message.
Hey, so I haven't called because...
well...
neither have you, so...
You were right...
About all of it.
You were right.
Crash cart!
This is a place where horrible things happen.
You were right to go.
You're probably escaping disaster.
Clear!
Uh, will you take her, please?
Look at me.
I practically grew up here.
10-blade.
Here you go, doctor.
And you're right.
It's hurt me...
In ways I'll probably never get over.
I have a lot of memories of people...
people I've lost forever.
But I have a lot of other memories, too.
This is the place where I fell in love...
The place where I found my family.
This is where I learned to be a doctor...
where I learned how to take responsibility
for someone else's life.
And it's the place I met you.
So I figure this place has given me
as much as it's taken from me.
I've lived here as much as I've survived here.
It just depends on how I look at it.
I'm gonna choose to look at it that way
and remember you that way.
Hope you're good.
Bye.
Hello?
You are my person.
