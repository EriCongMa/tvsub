one bravo 142 , in pursuit of a possible code 10 vehicle
heading westbound on bishop street .
all units be advised , one bravo 142 is in pursuit .
units to respond in two or less .
unit , per the watch commander ,
do you have a suspect description for responding units ?
that &apos;s negative . he took off before we could approach .
as of now , we &apos;re still chasing the taillights .
suspect now inside the shipyard .
i need containment around the perimeter .
responding units be advised i am now on foot .
responding units , the handling unit is now on foot .
any responding unit not on the containment ,
meet the handling unit at the east gate
for a grid search assignment .
spread out . he has to be here somewhere .
sarge !
sarge , i got tire tracks !
he must have ditched the car in one of these containers .
let &apos;s get &apos; em open .
this is the car .
no sign of the driver .
sarge , over here !
what you got ?
blood .
open it .
oh , my god .
have you ever thought about investing in gold ?
are you a financial planner with clients interested in gold ?
maybe you &apos;d considered gold ,
but the commissions were just too high .
i &apos;m convinced the market &apos;s gonna crash .
with the u.s. dollar falling and inflation rising ,
i &apos;ve already converted considerable amounts
of my assets into gold .
i remember the &apos; 70s when gold went through the roof .
call the international gold and silver broker &apos;s association
and receive the lowest pricing anywhere .
now is the time to buy gold again .
gold savings accounts ,
gold investment accounts , gold ira accounts .
u.s. coins , international coins ...
i was watching that .
through the blanket ?
oh , well , i was listening anyway .
yeah , i mean , because there &apos;s nothing
more soothing than the sound of somebody trying
to sell you gold coins , right ?
you know , i need something
to block out the sound of the ocean
&apos;cause the waves keep crashing
over and over and over again , steven .
some would say it &apos;s a relaxing sound , danny .
yeah ? some people would .
and other people , like myself ,
would say it &apos;s hawaiian water torture , okay ?
two weeks now , i can &apos;t take it anymore .
okay , you know i don &apos;t mind you crashing with me
till you find your own place , right ?
i appreciate that .
okay , but i can &apos;t sleep with the tv on .
i can &apos;t sleep with the tv off .
and we discussed that before you moved in .
yeah , we did . i think i remember
that it &apos;s mcgarrett house rule number 32 :
no tv after midnight .
i &apos;m sorry the hotel didn &apos;t working out for you .
wait , wait , whoa , whoa . the hotel didn &apos;t &quot; not work out , &quot; okay ?
it became infested with black mold .
there &apos;s a difference . that &apos;s a sign from god .
but ...
i have become accustomed to doing things a certain way .
yeah , i know , and your way , your way is completely insane .
it &apos;s nuts . who can take a shower in under three minutes ?
have you ever heard of a navy shower , danny ?
a navy shower ?
no . where do you think
i would have heard of something like a navy shower ?
i &apos;m not in the navy .
three minutes is a luxury
in a navy shower , danny !
mcgarrett .
on the way .
put your pants on .
we &apos;re going to work .
who &apos;s the mummy ?
how &apos;s it coming , max ?
well , based on my preliminary examination ,
it appears that the cause of death
was a single gunshot wound to the chest .
there was no exit wound ,
so i will be able to recover the bullet
and send it to ballistics .
no wallet was found on the victim , though ,
so i &apos;m attempting to ...
oh , hello , gentlemen .
how nice of you to arrive .
max , you o ... you okay , something wrong ?
as i was saying , i &apos;m attempting to get his fingerprints ,
but it seems that all of his fingerprints
have been sanded off ,
so we will have to find another way to identify him .
interesting , &apos; cause even when fingerprints are sanded down ,
you know , they grow back in a few weeks ,
so to keep &apos; em filed down to that level takes
a lot of time and effort .
maybe our killer didn &apos;t want this guy identified .
yeah , i mean , if he &apos;s sanding down his fingerprints ,
just imagine what he did to our vic &apos;s face .
somebody went to a lot of trouble
to hide this guy &apos;s identity .
the question is : why ?
kono and i have been looking into the muscle cars
found at the shipyard to see
if our vic &apos;s connected to them somehow .
let me guess-- they &apos;re not headed to any dealership .
nope , vin plates were popped off or filed down ,
and the containers were tagged to ship to china and japan .
yeah , big market over there for american muscle cars .
yeah .
victim may have pissed off the car thieves .
maybe , but why leave the body in the trunk
of one of their stolen cars ?
maybe they were going to dump the body
when the ship was at sea .
hpd has the cars .
we can head over there .
maybe we can collect some evidence .
we find the car thieves , we might find the killer .
right now i &apos;d settle for an id on our vic .
max .
max .
max .
ah , good to see you , agent weston .
good to see you , max .
he &apos;s ignoring us .
um , you said on the phone you , you got something for us ?
yes , i was able to recover a nine @-@ millimeter bullet
from our victim &apos;s thoracic cavity
and send it over to ballistics .
okay , were they , uh , able to find a match ?
yeah , did they get a match , max ?
unfortunately , the search for a match proved unsuccessful .
however , i did find something very interesting
after i was able to remove the victim &apos;s bandages .
please follow me .
great .
behold .
note the sutures under the eyes and the chin .
those would be consistent with recent implantations .
what kind of implantations ?
you mean plastic surgery or ... ?
recently , since the sutures haven &apos;t been removed .
judging by the onset of rigor ,
the work was probably done around time of death .
also note the numerous surgical scars .
this man had work done on his cheeks ,
his nose , and his brows .
his appearance was severely altered .
well , maybe it wasn &apos;t the killer
who didn &apos;t want this guy identified .
maybe it was the vic himself .
right .
great , so we have no way to identify him ?
that &apos;s not entirely true .
any implant that goes in a human body
is marked with a serial number .
i can trace that serial number
back to the clinic that purchased them
and then use that information to obtain an id .
of course , i &apos;m still in the middle of a full investigation ,
so once i know more , i will let you know .
great . thanks , max .
thanks , max .
you &apos;re welcome , agent weston .
anything to help a friend .
what did you do to him ?
i &apos;m sorry , what , what did i do ? why me ?
well , he &apos;s obviously upset about something .
boys ...
evidently you automatically assume it &apos;s me .
that &apos;s ridiculous .
well , i @-@ i know it wasn &apos;t me .
you offend more people than i offend .
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s true at all .
guys .
i &apos;m gonna have to give you a time @-@ out .
let &apos;s get out of here .
we got a murderer to catch .
&apos;69 camaro z28 .
ah , the thieves had good taste .
hey , didn &apos;t uncle keako have one of these ?
mm @-@ hmm .
man , i loved that ride .
that rusted out old thing ?
i couldn &apos;t believe it when he let me take it to the prom .
okay , i do not want to hear about your prom night .
actually wasn &apos;t as glamorous as you might think .
i , uh , i ran out of gas
and had to walk five miles for a refill .
smooth , cuz .
find anything ?
nothing-- no prints , no tool marks .
these guys were pros . you ?
uh , yeah , come take a look .
now , all the cars match descriptions of recently stolen vehicles ,
except for the one we found the victim in .
so you &apos;re thinking it wasn &apos;t stolen ?
i don &apos;t know , maybe the car belonged to the vic .
that makes sense .
he could have gotten jacked , fought back .
only why leave the body ?
all right , what do we have in terms of leads ?
all right , well , one thing these cars all have in common is new parts .
okay , so either they &apos;ve all been recently restored ...
huge coincidence .
... or
the car thieves had the work done
to make it harder for us to track them .
but it could be a way to track our killers .
let &apos;s go find out who pimped these rides .
all right .
howzit ?
for you , pretty lady .
that &apos;ll be a hundred bucks .
$ 100 for an air freshener ?
no , no .
for your information . what i pay , you pay .
and the air freshener ?
threw that in for free .
uh ... thanks , i guess .
all right , what you got ?
aren &apos;t you going to hang that up ?
oh . yeah .
uh , thanks , kamekona .
i always wanted an air freshener that smells like ...
spam musubi ?
yeah .
they call that fragrance line aromas of hawaii .
i got loco moco for myself .
uh , brah ...
oh , yeah .
the manager does not know
of any &apos; 69 camaros getting boosted ,
but he know one bruddah where you can get one .
this bruddah have a name ?
ken nakoa .
word is , all you got to do
is get a shopping list of the wheels you need ,
few days later ...
he delivers your groceries .
not mine .
i wouldn &apos;t partake in such a morally questionable arrangement .
others ...
don &apos;t have my strength of character .
of course .
make sure that ken nakoa gets this asap .
&quot; 1966 ford mustang . &quot; what &apos;s this ?
it &apos;s our shopping list .
shoots .
thanks for the spam .
it &apos;s max .
just be nice .
hi , max .
i was successfully able to remove the implants from the victim
and trace the serial numbers back to a manufacturer .
all right . that &apos;s really great .
do they know who the buyer was ?
the manucturer confirmed they sent the implants
to pukana la clinic , run by dr. thomas james .
he &apos;s known to do excellent work .
uh , great . that &apos;s great .
excellent work . thank you very much .
great work .
say , max , uh ,
is it possible that you &apos;re upset with us--
perhaps danny-- for some reason ?
did he just hang up on us ?
i think he did . max ? yeah .
definitely something you did .
you know this guy , doc ?
yeah , his name was ryan jackson .
i did the work on him myself about two days ago .
what happened ?
that &apos;s what we &apos;re trying to find out .
right , so anything you can tell us
would be a ... be a great help .
of course .
jackson wasn &apos;t our normal patient .
i can tell you that .
okay , well , in the world of elective surgery ,
what defines normal , doc ?
the amount of work , for starters .
normally , people come in here for small jobs--
liposuction , botox , maybe a face @-@ lift .
but not , uh ... not jackson ?
no .
jackson came in specifically asking
for complete facial reconstruction .
i recommended rhinoplasty , a brow lift ,
insertion of cheek implants , the works .
you didn &apos;t think it was a little suspicious ?
i mean , what if this guy was a murderer ,
child molester , i don &apos;t know ?
that &apos;s not my job .
that &apos;s not your job ?
no , you just , uh , cash the check .
um , we &apos;re gonna need to see his file ,
uh , payment information , if that &apos;s all right .
no , of course .
great .
i mean , i can get you the file , but
there &apos;s not gonna be any payment information .
jackson paid in cash .
i &apos;m sorry . cash ?
it &apos;s not uncommon .
these procedures are elective surgeries ,
which aren &apos;t covered by insurance .
here &apos;s the file .
all right , thank you .
look , anything else you can remember
about ryan jackson ?
um , only that he left in a hurry .
i wanted him to stay overnight after the procedure ,
but when i went to recovery to check on him , he was gone .
look at this .
there &apos;s something about this address .
numbers don &apos;t look right .
what do you mean ?
yeah , it &apos;s just as i thought .
the numbers are too high .
this address right here--
it &apos;d put us in the middle of the ocean .
well , that &apos;s not good .
also , what , no photos ? pre @-@ op ,
post @-@ op photos ?
normally , we take them ,
but jackson asked that none be taken .
claimed it was a privacy issue .
excuse me . what are you doing ?
your spidey @-@ senses tingling ? what &apos;s going on ?
did jackson fill out his paperwork right here ?
yeah , of course .
all of our clients fill out their intake information here in the lobby .
cosmetic dentistry ?
so , there &apos;s something wrong with my teeth ?
flip it over .
&quot; dr. ryan jackson , dds . &quot;
coincidence .
his name is also ryan jackson .
our victim didn &apos;t even use his real name .
pretty slick .
so who the hell is this guy ?
you guys owe me big @-@ time for this .
for what , a makeover ?
you look hot .
now go mingle .
and try not to trip .
in six @-@ inch heels ?
not making any promises .
one foot in front of the other , kid .
i still think kono would have looked way hotter in this outfit .
sorry , sistah .
i did my time undercover , now it &apos;s on you .
keep an eye out for nakoa .
yeah , this place is a known hangout
for local muscle car owners ,
and it &apos;s right in the middle of the neighborhood where nakoa works ,
so , he should be by pretty soon .
okay . got it .
hey , got him .
headed my way .
love to get a look under the hood .
how often do you use that line ?
wouldn &apos;t have thought you were into whips by looking at you .
oh , there &apos;s a lot of stuff
i &apos;m into that might surprise you .
oh , really ?
like ... ?
like 350 horses .
that a 351 windsor ?
uh @-@ huh . get you to 60 in under six seconds .
phew ! moves fast .
i like to move fast .
let &apos;s take her for a test ride , see what she can do .
yeah , okay .
get in .
she rides smooth .
wait till you open her up .
unlock the door !
don &apos;t make me ask you again .
come on ! come on !
you-- out , now !
not you . drive .
i said , drive !
she bought it .
that &apos;s right .
whoa , what &apos;s going on ?
everything locked up .
hit the gas , man .
i &apos;m trying . i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on .
what are we gonna do ?
i can &apos;t get the door open !
the whole thing is stuck !
the engine &apos;s dead .
oh , man , it &apos;s the cops .
damn it !
we got to get out of here , man !
it &apos;s a trap .
damn it !
license and registration , please .
the way we figure it ,
you and your friends tried your car grab scheme
on this guy , and it went bad .
all right , then you stashed
the body in the trunk of one of the cars you stole .
look , i &apos;ve never seen king tut before in my life .
you really expect us to believe that ?
i don &apos;t care what you believe . it &apos;s the truth .
doesn &apos;t care what we believe .
how about this , nakoa , all right ?
we saw the shopping list , yeah ? you steal cars .
you stole that car , there was a dead guy in the trunk , so ,
you talk to us , or you &apos;re going to be talking to a cellmate
for the rest of your life .
you see how this works ?
i knew it was too good to be true .
what are you talking about ?
we saw that baby on the side of ala moana ,
keys still in the ignition , pristine condition ,
just begging to get taken .
the whole thing felt weird .
you &apos;re lying .
i swear on my kids .
we took it to the docks and put it with the others .
why didn &apos;t you check the trunk ?
it was a rush job . didn &apos;t even get a chance to paint it .
cleared out the inside and stashed it .
it &apos;s a classic .
figured someone would be asking for one eventually .
find anything inside the car ?
only thing i found was a duffel bag on the passenger seat .
where is the bag now ?
nakoa &apos;s story checks out .
tod has our vic dead before the car was stolen .
well , at least we still got nakoa on grand theft auto .
right ?
right .
what do you got , kono ? anything interesting ?
yeah , i got three shirts , three pairs of shorts ,
socks and three pairs of boxers .
all right . well , now we know our victim
preferred boxers to briefs , but still no id .
that &apos;s not all .
i found this in a side pocket .
it goes to room 235 of the kalihi motel .
i already reached out to the manager ,
and the renter &apos;s name is adam raines .
could be our victim &apos;s real name .
yeah . or our killer .
good work .
nice place .
yeah . wonder if it comes with black mold .
too soon ?
little bit .
okay .
hey , hey . no , it &apos;s okay .
we &apos;re five @-@ o. we &apos;re five @-@ o.
it &apos;s okay .
what &apos;s your name ?
suzie greene .
where &apos;s adam ?
adam raines ?
yeah .
how do you know adam ?
he &apos;s my boyfriend .
is he in some sort of trouble ?
he was supposed to be back by now .
suzie , do you know if adam has had
any plastic surgery recently ?
yes . why ?
what ?
has something happened to adam ?
yeah .
he loved that car .
restored it himself ; that &apos;s how we met .
he started coming into the shop ,
i worked in the pick up parts .
after we started dating , he said
he used to return stuff just as an excuse to see me .
how long were you guys together ?
a year and a half .
he moved in with me about a year ago ,
but ...
we @-@ we hadn &apos;t seen each other much lately .
why is that ?
he worked on a cable ship ...
laying underwater electric cable across the pacific .
he &apos;d be gone a month ,
home a week .
we tried to make it work the best we could .
but then , uh ...
what ? did something happen ?
about a week ago , he ...
called me , left me this strange message .
do you still have the message ? can we hear it ?
thanks .
suzie , it &apos;s me .
i ... i made a big mistake .
we have to move as soon as possible .
someone out here ...
i think my past caught up with me .
i can &apos;t talk now . i &apos;ll explain everything later .
call me back . i love you .
i @-@ i called him back ,
and , um ...
he said he was getting off the ship in a few days
and to meet him here .
when i saw him , he was so scared .
he told me to stay put
and that he &apos;d be back soon .
that was the last time i saw him .
do you have any idea
what he meant by his past catching up with him ?
i &apos;d always assumed that he had some sort of trouble with the law ,
but he never wanted to talk about it ,
so i learned not to ask .
you have to understand , adam was the gentlest man in the world .
so when he told me something happened on the ship
and we had to go ...
i said okay .
okay .
suzie , listen , do you , uh ...
do you have a photo of adam , what he looked like
before the ... the surgery ?
yeah . yeah .
can you ... think of any reason
or do you know why adam would have had plastic surgery ?
no .
no , he just said he would look different when he came back .
but he promised to tell me everything
as soon as we were safe .
okay ,
and you were just gonna ... go with him , no questions asked ?
if the person you loved had to move
halfway across the world , what would you do ?
what do you think ?
i think something must have happened
on that cable ship that set this guy off .
let &apos;s go find out what it was .
gentlemen .
i &apos;m cory sampson .
welcome to the triumph .
thank you .
not much i can tell you about adam raines .
he only been working here shy a year .
quiet guy . kept to himself . hard worker .
could &apos;ve made it a career if he &apos;d stuck around .
no complaints ?
never missed a shift
till he went on the milk run this morning .
i assume , since you &apos;re here , he &apos;s in some kind of trouble ?
adam raines is dead , sir .
sorry to hear that .
though you don &apos;t seem very surprised .
ships like this ,
hardly in port , always at sea ...
they &apos;ve been known to attract the occasional drifter .
yeah , middle of nowhere , good place to hide .
not the type to file notice .
when one takes off , i just assume they start running again .
all right , uh , any mishaps on the rig recently ,
perhaps one that would have sent adam running ?
incidents happen all the time out here .
this isn &apos;t exactly a cruise ship .
also , maybe he got into a beef
with somebody who followed him off the rig .
anybody else not come back this morning ?
everyone else is accounted for .
all right , listen , you got a crew list or something
that would show us the people that left the same time adam did ?
sure thing . list is in my office .
adam left on shore leave five days ago .
it looks like billy murphy hopped on that chopper last minute .
who &apos;s billy murphy ?
adam &apos;s roommate .
punk from boston , got here a few weeks ago .
all right , we need to talk with him .
what &apos;s this ?
well , it turns out
adam raines isn &apos;t our vic &apos;s real name ,
so i &apos;m looking through facial recognition
to see if i can get a match .
any luck searching the house ?
place was cleaned out-- no pictures ,
no personal items , even the fridge was empty .
our vic didn &apos;t want to leave a trail .
looks like we got a hit .
u.s. marshals ?
identity &apos;s classified .
who is this guy ?
give me a second .
hey , lori , what do you got ?
well , i just got off the phone
with a friend at the u.s. marshal &apos;s office .
our vic &apos;s name was jimmy sheehan .
who &apos;s jimmy sheehan ?
well , according to the marshals ,
he &apos;s a proud member of the witness protection program .
sheehan was an auto mechanic from boston ,
and one of three witnesses
to a murder committed by mickey o &apos;hara .
yeah . also known as &quot; lucky &quot; mickey o &apos;hara
of the boston irish mob .
head of the l street crew , o &apos;hara was convicted
of killing a man on castle island
in south boston three years ago .
turns out sheehan &apos;s testimony put o &apos;hara away ,
and after the trial , the three witnesses
were put into witsec and then moved to arizona .
okay , well , let me guess-- the witness protection
did not prove to be very protective .
no . the other two men were dead within a year .
after that , sheehan left the system
until he resurfaced here under the name ...
adam raines .
good work , guys .
so , sheehan and his roommate , they &apos;re both from boston .
maybe murphy was sent out here to find sheehan .
could be a retaliation hit .
apparently , somebody packed in a hurry .
how many ways off this ship ?
only way off is the way you came on .
that &apos;s murphy .
get up there ! move !
billy murphy .
back off , or i cut his throat !
calm down .
i just want to talk , that &apos;s all .
i &apos;m not talking to anybody .
now , back the hell up .
okay , listen ,
i &apos;m not moving .
i just want to talk to you .
okay ? just have a conversation .
let the guy go .
not gonna happen , brother .
don &apos;t do anything stupid , okay ?
right here , huh ? right here .
how about now , brother , can we talk now ?
get up , let &apos;s go .
okay , please .
please , please , please , trust me ,
this is gonna be a whole lot easier
if you just tell us about jimmy sheehan .
aren &apos;t we outside your jurisdiction ?
he &apos;s not the smartest guy , is he ?
yeah , you &apos;re right , murphy ,
these are international waters , okay ?
which means we &apos;re bound to the laws of the flag
that the ship flies , which is what , daniel , again ?
chinese .
oh , yeah , it &apos;s chinese .
okay , that &apos;s good , because that means
that out here we &apos;re not actually members of law enforcement .
all right ? which also means we &apos;re not bound
by silly little rules like , i don &apos;t know , due process ,
so that &apos;s fine with me if
that &apos;s the way you want to go .
no , no ,
that &apos;s not the way ... please .
why not ?
nobody &apos;s around .
that &apos;s not the way .
please trust me , that &apos;s an ugly way .
we can help each other , i believe .
help ?
yes , help .
how ?
i &apos;ll tell you how .
uh , we , uh , checked the satellite phone on the ship .
we know that you made some calls to the 617--
that &apos;s boston , right ?
yeah .
well , i can only imagine you were calling a loved one .
we can help you by letting them know that you are now in custody
and that you are fully cooperating with the police .
it &apos;s ringing .
i got it .
no , no , no , no , wait , wait .
wait , i &apos;ll talk . i &apos;ll talk !
i &apos;ll talk . come on .
man wants to talk .
all right , then , talk .
look , i never wanted to start anything .
i owe 30 large to l street .
bad bets . i came out here to hide , make some money ,
you know , pay &apos; em off before they found me .
all right . so then you recognized sheehan , huh ?
not right off . it took me , like ,
two weeks to figure it out , but eventually .
i mean , it &apos;s not every day
someone takes down mickey o &apos;hara .
everybody back home knows jimmy .
okay , so you called back home
and what , you arrange a visit ?
i did what i had to do .
they said they were sending out some guys .
i flew off to oahu to meet them .
i told them where to find jimmy ,
and they cleared my debt .
that &apos;s it .
all right ,
you said &quot; guys . &quot;
what guys ?
john and simon o &apos;toole .
brothers , age 35 and 33 .
grew up in southie .
both of them joined the l street crew before they were 18 .
suspected in over 12 murders that the government knows about ,
including the witnesses from the o &apos;hara case .
they &apos;re widely considered the top two
triggermen for the irish mob in boston .
these are the kind of guys that would have no problem
putting a bullet in jimmy sheehan &apos;s chest .
got a hit back from tsa .
looks like the o &apos;toole brothers arrived on the island
the day before sheehan was killed .
guys , i just pinged the cell phone number
murphy used to contact them .
they &apos;re at the kalihi motel .
that &apos;s where suzie &apos;s staying .
they &apos;re tying up loose ends .
you &apos;re making this so hard on yourself .
just tell us what we need to know , huh ?
where &apos;s jimmy ?
danny .
freeze !
drop your guns .
don &apos;t take another step !
got three seconds , or i put a bullet in her .
put the gun down .
one .
put it down .
two .
three .
put your hands behind your back now .
they kept asking about a man named jimmy sheehan .
they wanted to know where he was .
i told them i didn &apos;t know , but they didn &apos;t believe me .
come on , we need to get you to a safe place .
you hear that ?
yeah , i mean , i &apos;m not a rocket scientist ,
but if the o &apos;tooles thought that jimmy sheehan was alive ,
it means that they did not kill him .
yeah , okay , so if they didn &apos;t kill him , who did ?
you do a lot of smiling for a guy
who just saw his brother get shot .
simon knew the risks .
and i &apos;m smiling
&apos;cause you got nothing .
we got nothing .
nothing except , uh ,
kidnapping , first @-@ degree assault ...
murder one .
murder one .
i have the best lawyer in the world on speed dial .
he &apos;ll get it down to a class b felony--
ten years max , i &apos;ll be out in five .
you think so ?
know so .
well , that is , of course , if the girl makes it to trial .
i &apos;m sorry , is that a threat ?
wait a minute .
what about the murder of jimmy sheehan , huh ?
i mean , ballistics are going to come back
on the nine @-@ millimeter .
it &apos;s going to match your gun .
no , it won &apos;t , &apos; cause i didn &apos;t kill him .
if you didn &apos;t kill him ,
what are you doing in hawaii ?
don &apos;t say vacation .
we know about the phone call .
murphy couldn &apos;t keep his mouth shut , huh ?
all right ,
so it &apos;s possible me and simon
heard our old pal jimmy was here , and maybe
we came out to have a chat .
murphy gave you his address ?
and we figured we &apos;d tail him to a nice quiet spot
to have our conversation ,
but we lost him that afternoon .
we thought the trail was dead till we realized
he rented a room at a motel ,
and that &apos;s when we stumbled onto the girl .
at what point did you lose jimmy ?
parking structure on ala moana boulevard .
we watched him pull in , waited for hours .
he never came back out .
if jimmy got popped , it was in that building .
thanks for the information .
oh , keep smiling .
i almost forgot .
uh , ballistics already came back on your gun .
i told you i didn &apos;t kill him .
no , you didn &apos;t kill him ,
but the bullets matched a bunch of other open murders ,
you know , very specifically , the two other witnesses
in the mickey o &apos;hara case ,
so you should call your lawyer--
that really brilliant lawyer you were talking about--
maybe get your sentence knocked down
to 50 , 60 years , something like that .
enjoy federal prison .
it &apos;s really nice this time of year .
see you .
so i got the security footage
from the parking structure where o &apos;toole lost sheehan .
there &apos;s no video , but they do have a stop @-@ motion camera
that captures license plates .
okay .
sheehan arrives here , right ?
but he never leaves .
oh , he left .
i mean , the car had to come out .
right , so i checked out the structure .
turns out that there &apos;s another exit
on the far end of the lot .
it &apos;s only for monthly users .
well , they got security footage there ?
no , but what it does require is an id card .
and that &apos;ll be the list of people who have one .
let &apos;s take a look .
one person swipes his card three times .
that doesn &apos;t make any sense .
three times-- that &apos;s an odd number .
i mean , you come in , you come out , bang .
unless ...
you exit twice .
that &apos;s right ,
once in somebody else &apos;s car
and then you double back for your own .
so maybe our guy drives out sheehan &apos;s car
and then comes back for his .
pull his id .
i think we just found our killer .
and our plastic surgeon .
can i help you ?
sir .
wait , you can &apos;t go back there .
dr. james is about to begin a procedure .
so he didn &apos;t die from the gunshot ?
no , no , he died on the table--
a complication with the surgery .
nobody said anything ?
the doctor was , um ,
was doing the surgery , uh , alone .
yeah , jimmy insisted that he do it that way because he was
worried that his real identity would get out .
when he died , the doctor panicked .
thought he was going to lose his practice ,
so he tried to cover it up .
right , he put the body in the trunk of jimmy &apos;s car
and he left it on the street .
why shoot him ?
because he figured if anybody found the body ,
they &apos;d just assume
that jimmy &apos;s past had caught up to him . you know ?
i just don &apos;t understand .
why didn &apos;t he just tell me everything ?
well , i think , &apos; cause he didn &apos;t want anything to happen to you .
he was trying to protect you and keep you safe .
i &apos;m really sorry .
you like that ?
yes , i do .
now you can watch all the tv you want .
this is , uh ... i &apos;m touched , thank you .
uh , but i do believe that i found a place .
really ?
yeah , nice little house
for rent right down the street from you .
forget about it .
oh , right , rule number 56 :
no coworkers living on the same block .
something like that , yeah , just ...
no , put it out of your mind . okay ?
these are still very nice .
wow , they work good .
can &apos;t hear you at all-- perfect .
excuse me .
excuse me , excuse me , hey , hey , hey !
what the hell are you wearing ? i wholeheartedly approve .
i &apos;m just curious , that &apos;s all .
it &apos;s theme movie night at max &apos;s .
we &apos;re all invited .
i @-@ i wasn &apos;t invited .
i @-@ i wasn &apos;t invited either .
oh , yes , you were .
see ?
max is doc @ spacetrekkie ?
yeah , it &apos;s his personal e @-@ mail .

i knew this was your fault .
