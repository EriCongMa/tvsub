one , two , three .
okay .
okay . great .
all right . don &apos;t do that .
don &apos;t do what ?
once you get up , don &apos;t look down at your feet .
how am i supposed to know
where my feet are if i can &apos;t look down at &apos; em ?
let &apos;s do it again .
come on .
all right , i feel like a goof .
okay , i mean , am i gonna actually surf at any point
during this surfing lesson , or no ?
yeah , but you got to master the basics .
i don &apos;t care about the basics .
i &apos;m doing this &apos; cause grace wants to learn how to surf ,
and i figure , it &apos;d be a nice thing for me to do with her .
okay , and i &apos;m positive that this
is not what she had in mind .
okay . okay , okay . you think you &apos;re ready ?
of course i &apos;m ready . come on .
okay , go catch a wave , brah .
maybe we can just work on the basics this much more . okay ?
and then we &apos;ll go .
what the hell is that ?
it &apos;s a tsunami warning .
it &apos;s a tsunami ... ? are you kidding me ?
we have to evacuate the area now . come on .
hey , get out of here . you move !
danny , come on . let &apos;s get out of here .
attention . this is a mandatory evacuation .
okay , let &apos;s go !
move away from the beach .
this a mandatory evacuation . move away from the beach .
governor .
sir .
okay .
where &apos;s the point of origin ?
what &apos;s the eta of the first wave ?
tsunami warning buoys picked up the wave
about a hundred miles northeast of wake island .
they think it was triggered by a deep ocean landslide .
eta on the first set of waves is , like , three hours .
yes . sir , i can be there in ten .
yes , governor , i &apos;ll be there five .
competitive much ?
it &apos;s a curse .
command &apos;s called all personnel back to base .
we &apos;re gonna take the fleet out to deep waters and ride it out .
huh . must be nice .
i guess the rest of us
who don &apos;t have a seat on an aircraft carrier--
we &apos;ll just have to get our snorkels out .
mmm . be careful today , okay ?
yeah . you , too .
hey , everything is gonna be okay , monkey .
i promise you that . it &apos;s good news .
we get a day off of school , that &apos;s all .
well , my friend tommy said the waves can get
as tall as buildings and go as fast as race cars .
oh , he did , huh ?
well , tommy also told you
that he killed a tiger shark with a boogie board .
okay , tommy is what i like to call a pathological liar .
so from now on , we are gonna put the closed sign
on our ears when tommy talks , okay ?
tommy .
tommy &apos;s a goof , babe .
what &apos;s up ?
hey , i need you to meet me
at the tsunami warning center at ewa beach , all right ?
what ? right now ?
yeah . now . the head of the center ,
a dr. norman russell , has gone missing .
hey , you there ?
yeah . it &apos;s just , i got grace ,
and , um , stan and rachel are out of town .
you got anybody to watch her ?
no , i don &apos;t . why ? you got anything in mind ?
yeah .
howzit , bruddah ?
you got a high @-@ priority assignment for me .
high @-@ pri ... yeah .
are you sure this is a good idea ?
he looked after my sister .
yeah , i know , and your sister ran away .
hey . that &apos;s bulai , brah . she tricked me .
playing on my emotional vulnerabilities .
that part &apos;s true .
shut up , you .
and besides , i &apos;m great with keikis .
i got this .
baby , you remember kamekona from christmas ?
yeah ? what do you say ?
i mean , word on the street is , he &apos;s a lot of fun .
you want to go hang out with him for a little bit ?
but i want to stay with you .
that &apos;s understandable .
but listen .
you &apos;re gonna go play at his house for a little while
because it &apos;s really far away from the water .
okay ? and that &apos;s what i want you to do .
the second we get this thing figured out ,
which will be very soon-- i can assure you that--
i &apos;m gonna come back , and i &apos;m gonna get you , i promise .
okay ? is that okay ?
okay .
you like shave ice , grace ? killahz .
i &apos;ve been working on some new flavors .
i need a taste @-@ tester .
you down with helping me out ?
yeah .
awesome ...
all right . i love you .
love you too , danno .
you got , uh , seat belts ?
danny ...
no worry . no worry .
trust me , bruddah .
got your back .
you guys know that .
all right , tell me something .
why is it that we &apos;re not helping thousands of people evacuate ?
instead , we &apos;re looking for one missing person .
because , danny , that one person is responsible
for making sure those thousands of people are safe .
all right , fair enough . define missing .
missing as in , hasn &apos;t been seen
or heard from since last night .
chin and kono are checking his house right now .
look , sheldon , there &apos;s a big difference between evacuating
at a level one and a level three .
you need to make the call .
i need more time with the data .
dr. russell &apos;s usually the one who defines the inundation zone .
but dr. russell isn &apos;t here ,
so today , it &apos;s your job .
i ...
excuse me . i &apos;m sorry to interrupt .
i &apos;m lieutenant commander steve mcgarrett from five @-@ o.
this is detective danny williams .
we &apos;re investigating the disappearance of dr. russell .
sheldon tunney , deputy director .
commander sam hale . coast guard .
you &apos;ll have to excuse me , but we need to move now .
so if you &apos;re not going to make the call , i will .
better to be safe than sorry .
i &apos;m declaring it a level three .
oh , sorry about that .
lot of confusion around here without dr. russell .
okay , look , i see a room full of scientists .
what is so important about dr. russell ? i &apos;m just curious .
let &apos;s talk in my office .
look , normally , there are a number of us who can interpret
the data we &apos;re receiving from the warning buoys .
but the stuff we &apos;re getting now is riddled with anomalies .
anom ... what kind of anomalies ?
wave height , water pressure , barometric shift .
they all affect the calculations
as to the size and magnitude of the wave ,
and they &apos;re all over the map .
okay , i &apos;m a visual learner .
okay , uh , here . look .
this is a simulation based on our most recent data .
in the previous set of data , the wave
was about half the size ,
but before that , it was off the charts .
ever since the buoy triggered
5 a.m. , there &apos;s been no discernible pattern .
the data keeps changing .
what about the other warning centers ?
are you consulting with them ?
we &apos;re the main center for the entire pacific rim .
we checked with our satellite center in alaska ,
but they &apos;re receiving
conflicting data , as well .
okay , so what you &apos;re telling me is , all you people--
you have no idea what &apos;s coming at us ?
is that right ?
i can make an educated guess
based on the most recent data .
but we &apos;re talking about a wave that could be the size
of a three @-@ story building ,
and traveling at the speed of a jet plane .
i don &apos;t want to guess .
well , looks like tommy was telling the truth for once .
who &apos;s tommy ?
he &apos;s an eight @-@ year @-@ old boy .
okay , uh , so what you &apos;re saying is ,
dr. russell could make sense of all of this ?
if anyone could , it &apos;s him .
he practically developed this technology .
he knows these waters better than anyone .
when &apos;s the last time you spoke to him ?
last night at about 5 : 00,
when we were leaving the office .
and then at 6 : 00 a.m. , i get a page that
the first buoy had indicated a tsunami .
and protocol demands that i consult with dr. russell
before initiating any of these emergency procedures ,
but he never contacted me , and i couldn &apos;t get a hold of him .
guys , he lives for this stuff .
he &apos;d be the first person
at this office the minute his pager went off .
chin , what do you got ?
looks like foul play , gentlemen .
forced entry .
signs of a struggle .
well , the neighbors have been evacuated .
but no disturbances have been reported to hpd .
so , hawaii &apos;s top tsunami expert comes up missing
on , uh ... on the one day that we need him ?
you know what they say about coincidences .
i don &apos;t .
they usually take a lot of planning .
okay , what do you think ?
this happened fast .
they definitely came in from there .
i think he was sitting there , got up .
there was a struggle . he came this way .
he hit the wall .
sorry , ma &apos;am . hold it right there .
and he hit the deck .
blood trail goes that way .
this is my father &apos;s house .
looks like a lot of blood .
could be a gunshot wound .
gunshot wound ?
what happened ?
where &apos;s my dad ?
courtney , when was the last time you spoke to your father ?
last night around 8 : 00 .
okay . what were you guys talking about ?
my physics final .
i had a question about free particles .
and i was totally lost , and he helped me .
what ?
i would just really hate it if the last time
i talked to my father was about physics .
do you remember anything else he said ?
uh , doesn &apos;t matter how trivial it seemed .
uh , we talked about going for a hike this weekend .
that &apos;s it .
um , he seemed totally , you know , fine .
but when the sirens went off this morning ,
and i didn &apos;t hear from him , i started to get worried .
who would want to hurt him ?
all right , listen . i promise you that we &apos;re doing
everything we can to find your father , but right now ,
you have to evacuate .
i &apos;m staying here .
i got it . i got it .
courtney ,
your father would want you to be safe . i know that .
all right ? i &apos;m going to have an officer take you inland
and the second i hear anything ,
you will be the first to know . you have my word , okay ?
okay .
all right ?
thank you .
my friend mark . he &apos;s a very good guy .
he &apos;ll take care of you , all right ?
okay , so what do we got ?
skid marks and white paint chips .
looks like someone pulled out of the driveway fast
and clipped russell &apos;s car-- could be our kidnappers .
there &apos;s only 100,000 white cars on the island .
good shape .
what else ?
empty sandbag .
it could be garbage ,
but one man &apos;s garbage is another man &apos;s evidence .
let &apos;s grab it .
so , i &apos;ve accessed the twc security log
to digitally retrace russell &apos;s last steps .
it looks like he logged in this morning at 5 : 32 a.m.
that &apos;s about a half an hour
before the first buoy indicated a tsunami .
well , maybe he had an early indication of the landslide .
do we have any idea of what he saw ?
no . he didn &apos;t log in from this computer , so i can &apos;t see
what he was accessing .
wait a minute . if he didn &apos;t log in from this computer ,
then maybe he &apos;d been taken already .
can we trace the ip address from where he did log in ?
no . the security log doesn &apos;t record ip addresses ,
but what it does record are failed login attempts .
now , when he logged in , he entered
an incorrect password twice
before entering the correct one .
wait . don &apos;t you mean somebody else was trying
to guess his password ?
that &apos;s what i thought at first , too .
but the incorrect password that was entered
was the same both times .
okay . and if somebody was trying to log in ,
they would have been trying out different passwords .
exactly .
the other thing is ,
the incorrect password was made of up four numbers :
&quot; 1015 . &quot;
the real password is &quot; courtneyrose . &quot;
it &apos;s his daughter &apos;s name .
right . they &apos;re nothing alike .
i think he entered the wrong password on purpose .
he was trying to send a message , which means at 5 : 30,
when he sent that message , he was still alive .
okay , so at what point are we going to follow the sane people
and just get to high ground ?
as soon as we figure out what message dr. russell was sending .
okay , we can &apos;t do that , uh , i don &apos;t know , up on a mountain ?
somewhere ? ferris wheel ? building ?
something high ? huh ?
mamo , what &apos;s up ?
brah , you got to get these cops off my back .
they want me to board up and get off the beach .
just do as they say , mamo .
okay ? there &apos;s a tsunami coming .
it &apos;s not safe to be on the beach .
steve , i was here in &apos; 60,
&apos;64 , and &apos; 75 . i &apos;ve seen &apos; em all .
i know the water .
there &apos;s no tsunami in her today .
okay , listen . i hear you ,
but you got to get out of there , just in case . all right ?
okay , brah . but i &apos;m telling you .
somebody &apos;s blowing smoke up somebody &apos;s &apos; okole .
just be safe , mamo .
that &apos;s good . so , mamo doesn &apos;t think that there &apos;s a tsunami .
i guess not . but i mean , who knows the water better than him ?
scientists , steven .
scientists that study this type of thing , okay ,
that told us a tsunami &apos;s coming in one hour and 27 minutes .
these watermen have been reading the waves
for hundreds of years , danny .
i @-@ i commend them for their commitment . i really do .
if mamo wants to help , why doesn &apos;t he use his insights
and tell us where dr. russell is .
that would be insightful .
you know what ? this whole thing , it doesn &apos;t add up .
i mean , why would anyone kidnap dr . russell ?
it &apos;s not like he has
any classified government secrets or anything .
who benefits ?
anybody selling bottled water or gasoline .
that was a joke , steven .
wai , wait , wait . no , no , no .
this isn &apos;t someone starting a fire to empty a crowded theater .
okay ? this is a natural disaster .
you cannot create a tsunami .
that &apos;s right . unless you can .
where are you going ?
back to the tsunami warning center .
did you pick up auntie emele ?
okay . good .
all right . be safe , cuz .
you didn &apos;t get called in , did you ?
all right . how much more of the hospital do you have to evacuate ?
okay . just be safe .
bye .
was that malia ?
yeah .
how &apos;s auntie emele ?
fine .
have you seen malia since we ran into her at the hospital ?
you guys aren &apos;t getting back together again , are you ?
easy , cuz . i &apos;m just checking on the hospital &apos;s evacuation .
look , we have to get somewhere
on the failed password and the paint chips .
everyone &apos;s already evacuated . we may have to join them soon .
okay .
how are the latest projections ?
same as before . all over the map .
we &apos;re preparing for the worst .
what &apos;s the latest on dr. russell ?
we think we got a lead , but we need to know
how does the early warning system work ?
how do you get your information ?
well , it &apos;s really not that complicated .
hop up . okay .
look .
these markers indicate the location
of the tsunami warning buoys .
the buoys record information about the wave
and send that data to the goes 11 satellite .
and the goes 11 transmits the data to us .
got it .
could you , uh , maybe just simplify ?
uh , 20 words or less .
like @-@ like the field trip version ?
i don &apos;t know what that means .
all right .
buoys in the water get info .
send it to the satellite .
the satellite sends it here .
okay , that &apos;s all . was that so difficult ?
no .
question . is there a relay station
that the signal passes through
or any place that could compromise the signal ?
no . it &apos;s a clean feed from goes 11 to us .
oh ! you &apos;ll have to excuse me .
okay , thank you . you &apos;ve been very helpful .
yeah .
how was that helpful ?
you just be quiet for a second , okay ? so the adults can think .
think ? think ? thinking ? is that what that face means ?
hey , it &apos;s me .
what do you need ?
why can &apos;t i just be calling to say hello ?
theoretically , it &apos;s possible . sure . but you never have before ,
and it seems like a really odd time to start .
that is a fair point .
uh , i need to know if there &apos;s a second signal
being transmitted on the same frequency
as the goes 11 satellite .
sure .
what &apos;s going on ?
i don &apos;t know yet .
what ?
what are you talking about-- a second signal ?
th @-@ this . i understand that .
there &apos;s a buoy and it goes to a satellite
and the satellite goes here . i understand that .
but , mr. wizard ,
i &apos;m curious . why do we care ?
tunney was saying the data kept changing this morning .
okay ? what if it &apos;s changing
because a false signal is overriding
the actual signal from space ?
this ... space .
so the buoys and the satellite thing is ...
they &apos;re not ... ?
dr. russell , danny ! dr. russell !
why are you yelling at me ?
just ...
steve ?
hey .
okay . you were right . there is a second signal ,
and it &apos;s not coming from space .
it &apos;s coming from a boat in the ala wai harbor .
okay , i need to know if anybody is on the boat .
okay , can you get me thermals ?
are you trying to get me court @-@ martialed ?
come on . i wouldn &apos;t ask if it wasn &apos;t important .
although , having you on land more often
would have its benefits .
okay , thermals are up .
you got at least one live body on board .
can you text me the coordinates ?
i can do you one better .
it &apos;s the avery claire , slip 21 .
you &apos;re the best . thank you .
steve , please tell me
that you &apos;re not even thinking of going out there , okay ?
this is right in the path of the wave .
it &apos;s okay . i got an hour . there &apos;s plenty of time .
i &apos;ll call you later , okay ?
your theory .
dr. russell was kidnapped
to create a fake signal .
what ? no gold star ?
let &apos;s go get the boat , okay ?
wait . what if you &apos;re wrong ?
this is good . this is genius .
now we &apos;re driving towards the water . this is your plan ?
this is your plan ?
listen to me . if i &apos;m gonna die on this island ,
which i never should have come to in the first place ,
your face is not the last face i want to see .
you understand that ? respectfully , of course .
mcgarrett , 5 @-@ 0 .
ok .
i know you like it here .
i like ... here ? i like ...
incorrect . you are incorrect , my friend .
then why the board , huh ?
i mean , did hell freeze over ?
did i actually miss out on seeing you trying
to get up on that thing ?
no comment .
all right ? let &apos;s stick to a more pressing theory ,
as to why you think dr. russell is in this boat .
because this is where
the second signal is coming from .
the second signal ?
yeah .
oh . okay . well , i hope you &apos;re right .
because if you are not ,
we are going to be sleeping
with the fishes , literally , in 45 minutes .
chin , go ahead .
we &apos;ve got a problem .
what is that ?
the wave just picked up speed-- it &apos;s coming in faster
than they thought .
how much faster ?
it &apos;s coming right now .
all right . come on , steve . what are we doing ? let &apos;s go .
come on .
it &apos;s not coming .
it &apos;s not coming .
the water &apos;s not receding .
if the wave was coming , the water would be receding .
nobody else ... nobody else finds that significant enough
to call this thing off .
danny , there &apos;s nobody else here . there &apos;s no one around .
nobody else knows about the second signal .
this is just a wild guess : that &apos;s not dr. russell .
yeah . i don &apos;t think so .
okay . my work is done .
can we go now , please ?
come on .
where &apos;s dr. russell ?
look , could we ... could we do this on land ?
potentially maybe in one of these tall buildings ? tenth floor ?
please .
the tsunami &apos;s not real .
is it ?
maybe it &apos;s late .
what if it &apos;s late ?
the warning center &apos;s been picking up her signal ,
not the actual feed from the satellite .
she &apos;s been transmitting false data since this thing started .
naughty , naughty , naughty hacker .
if that is true , understand ,
you are in a lot of trouble-- so who are you
and who are you working for ?
hey . we &apos;re still dry .
yeah , sorry ,
it was a false alarm .
right after you hung up ,
the buoy &apos;s warning sensors updated and pushed
the wave &apos;s arrival time back to 11 : 00 a.m.
that &apos;s still not a lot of time
for you guys to get out of there , though .
it &apos;s okay , i don &apos;t believe the tsunami &apos;s real .
russell wasn &apos;t on the boat , but we found the source
of the fake signal-- it &apos;s a hoax .
a hoax ? that &apos;s a hell of a practical joke .
how can you be sure ?
we can &apos;t be , which is why right now
we stick to the primary plan .
hey , do you remember what i told you about coincidences ?
they take a lot of planning .
the false alarm hit at 10 : 15 .
10 : 15 , as in 1 @-@ 0 @-@ 1 @-@ 5 ?
that &apos;s dr. russell &apos;s failed password .
he knew-- and he was trying to tip us off
by manipulating the data .
that &apos;s what i think , too .
but what i don &apos;t get is , why take russell
and then have him fake a tsunami ?
to create a distraction .
any potential witnesses have cleared out .
the police are busy with the evacuation .
it &apos;s the perfect time to pull off something big .
you guys see if you can figure out what they &apos;re after .
we &apos;re gonna work on trying to find dr. russell .
got it .
this is what i &apos;m gonna do .
i &apos;m gonna ask you , uh , one more time ,
and then i am gonna potentially get angry .
so , please tell me-- where is dr. russell ?
look , you &apos;re just transmitting information , okay ?
dr. russell is sending
it to you from someplace else , isn &apos;t he ?
against his will .
mebody &apos;s forcing him to do this .
this is the part where you answer his question .
okay .
you see ?
you put us both in a bad position now-- he &apos;s gonna go do something stupid .
any luck with the paint you found outside russell &apos;s place ?
yeah , turns out it &apos;s unique .
only issued to government vehicles .
government ?
i &apos;m thinking maybe
our abductors stole one so they could hide in plain sight .
town &apos;s crawling with them .
i just haven &apos;t heard back from hpd .
yeah , well , i think they &apos;re a little bit busy right now .
what are all these ?
well , all government @-@ issued vehicles ,
they &apos;re equipped with gps .
so these are the live locations of all the evac trucks
sent out by department of emergency management ,
the coast guard , the national guard .
any one of them could have been at russell &apos;s .
hard to get eyes on them all .
yeah .
how many of these are in or around the evac zone ?
twenty @-@ four .
all of them with the same white paint we &apos;re looking for .
mcgarrett thinks all this
is a distraction from some bigger crime ,
so what we should do
is narrow down a list of high @-@ value targets
within the evacuation zone-- consulates ,
locations of visiting dignitaries , ambassadors ...
the bigger the distraction , the bigger the target .
yeah .
all right .
get some answers here .
cute kid .
look at you .
you &apos;re all cleaned up , nice , combed , fancy .
a little ... side part going on .
obviously , a long time ago .
that , uh ,
that &apos;s your little girl-- you don &apos;t see her that often , do you ?
i think kids are the best .
best thing ever .
the thing is about them at that age
is that they have the worst memories .
you know , my daughter , when she was three years old ,
she hadn &apos;t seen her uncle in , i don &apos;t know ,
five , six months , and then he
comes around , goes to pick her up ,
and she goes bananas .
i mean , she loses her mind ,
like she &apos;s never seen the guy in her life .
all right , starts screaming bloody murder .
i take her back .
anyway , they grow up fast , is what i &apos;m saying .
you know what else ? when you get locked up
for kidnapping dr. russell , i mean ,
it could be five ... it could be ten years .
before you see her again .
no , you can &apos;t do that !
okay .
speaks .
look , i don &apos;t know any dr. russell , okay ?
okay . so tell us what you do know .
every eight minutes i get an e @-@ mail
with new data from somewhere .
and they &apos;re giving me 25k to transmit it
over the tsunami warning frequency .
who is ? who &apos;s paying you ?
i don &apos;t know . it &apos;s all anonymous .
they found me online .
they sent me the money , in cash , and a pager .
the pager went off this morning ,
so i started broadcasting .
how long is this supposed to go on for ?
i don &apos;t know , until noon ?
and then what ?
it &apos;s over , i guess .
all right , i need to know who &apos;s sending these e @-@ mails .
how am i supposed to know that ?
you &apos;re a hacker . hack .
come on .
howzit ?
yo , fridge , what &apos;s good ?
how &apos;s my baby girl ?
oh , she &apos;s easy kine , brah .
right now my family &apos;s teaching her about king kamehameha
and the unification of the hawaiian islands .
okay . what ... hold on , what is that sound ?
please do me a favor-- don &apos;t do the part
where the king throws his enemies off the cliff .
ah , that &apos;s the best part .
could i just speak to her , please ?
keiki , danno for you .
hello ?
hey , baby . how you doing ?
can i go home now ?
no , you got to hang in there a little bit longer for me , okay ?
i &apos;m gonna be there just as soon as i can .
okay .
i love you , monkey .
love you , too .
is there anything else you want to do , grace ?
mmm ... me and daddy like to play cards .
shootz , you &apos;re looking at the king of go fish .
how about five @-@ card draw ?
hey , everything okay ?
is it okay ? yeah , it &apos;s perfect .
daughter &apos;s spending the day with an ex @-@ criminal informant .
everything is just peachy .
i blame you .
excuse me . i blame you .
how are we going on a location ?
i have a floating i.p. buried under layers
of firewalls and encryption .
rome didn &apos;t burn in a day .
i @-@ i don &apos;t ... i &apos;m pretty sure that &apos;s not ...
all right , is that him ?
no , it &apos;s an e @-@ mail from your friend .
it &apos;s been eight minutes-- i have to refresh the data .
oh , no , don &apos;t bother-- just trace the e @-@ mail
and find out where it &apos;s coming from .
no , wait , we need her to keep
transmitting until noon like she agreed .
otherwise , the kidnappers are gonna know
that their cover is blown
and dr. russell is as good as dead .
okay , so we &apos;ll just keep thousands of people in the dark
and maintain panic in the streets .
i like it .
the governor
is not gonna cancel the alert until we know for sure
from dr. russell that there is no real threat .
hah . gotcha .
there &apos;s our man .
chin , what do you got ?
the address checks out .
it &apos;s an old storage warehouse down on the docks .
okay , we &apos;re on the way .
hey , you got any hits on the paint
we collected at the crime scene ?
i ran a list of potential high @-@ value targets within the evac zone ,
and i crossed them against gps locations
of the government vehicles within the area ,
and only six of the targets
have government vehicles within a couple blocks .
okay , they only wanted tanya to keep up
the signal until noon , which means
whatever &apos;s going down is going down right now .
we don &apos;t have time to cover all the targets and find russell .
fine . guys , grab the op gear , meet us at the docks .
all right ...
this is the place ; they came in here .
it &apos;s bolted from the inside .
how do you want to get in ?
right over there . there &apos;s no sight lines .
just a few more hours ,
and you &apos;ll get to see your daughter .
i &apos;ve got eyes on dr. russell .
it &apos;s time for your next transmission .
get to work .
stay put .
five @-@ o ! drop your weapon !
you couldn &apos;t have walked him down the steps ?
what &apos;s in his hand , danny ?
he drew his gun on me , okay ?
you know , this guy looks familiar .
well , if he &apos;s in the system , we &apos;ll get a name .
got it .
they said i needed to keep sending new data until noon .
if i didn &apos;t give them new numbers every eight minutes ,
they were gonna kill my daughter .
she &apos;s okay . we had an
officer take her someplace safe .
thank you .
all right , you said &quot; they . &quot;
i heard him on the phone .
they needed a sector of the city evacuated .
which sector ? did you hear ?
no . but they needed me to fabricate data
that would force an evacuation deep inland .
do you have any idea what they were after ?
no .
hey .
hey , i got a hit on the print .
all right , hey .
name is harrison dunphy .
dishonorably discharged from the coast guard
eight years ago due to conduct unbecoming .
coast guard ?
yeah .
kono , bring every coast guard vehicle with white paint
and get a live location , okay ?
we need to see if these guys are
in front of any of the potential targets .
right , you got it .
this guy , dunphy ,
he ever serve with the 14th district ?
yeah . how &apos;d you know that ?
&apos;cause eight years ago ,
hpd worked a joint narco case with the guard .
we raided a shipment coming in off a freighter .
impounded 700 kilos of cocaine ,
along with millions of dollars in cash .
$ 28 million ?
$ 28 million that ended up
in the hpd asset @-@ forfeiture locker .
which is right in the center of the evacuation zone .
kono .
i &apos;m already on it .
pulling up the forfeiture locker .
there &apos;s a white truck parked out in front right now .
that &apos;s it-- they &apos;re going for
what they think is $ 28 million .
what they think is $ 28 million .
not until you borrowed $ 10 million of it to save my life .
we didn &apos;t have a choice .
look , if we didn &apos;t meet hesse &apos;s demanding $ 10 million ,
he would &apos;ve killed you .
well , $ 28 million , $ 18 million ,
doesn &apos;t matter-- they &apos;re hitting
the locker right now .
she &apos;s right .
hold on for one second . let &apos;s just think .
think about what this means .
hey , i know what this means , danny .
we go bust these guys ,
hpd does an inventory on that money ,
they are gonna see that $ 10 million is missing .
it doesn &apos;t necessarily trace back to us .
we asked the governor to borrow $ 10 million ,
and she turned us down .
as soon as the hpd tell her exactly how much is missing ,
she &apos;s gonna put it all together .
well , what &apos;s the alternative ?
we could let &apos; em go .
get a clean slate ...
all right , and then i &apos;d never
look at my daughter in the face again . let &apos;s go .
i &apos;ll drive .
we &apos;re doing the right thing .
i know .
we knew about the risks when we took the money .
i know .
we should call hpd , get backup .
that &apos;s an excellent idea-- just invite more cops
to arrest us .
you know what ? i know what you &apos;re thinking , all right ?
this is all my fault , and that &apos;s fine .
listen to me , i was there , too , my eyes were wide open ,
and i would do it again .
it was worth it for chin .
but you have to admit we &apos;ve been crossing the line
a little too easily lately .
all right ? and now it looks like we are going to pay for it .
hpd command .
yeah , this is five @-@ o.
we need assistance at the main station .
five @-@ o , be advised , closest responding unit is ten away .
what are you talking about , ten away ?
you guys should be right there !
all units are tied up on evac line
at lunalilo street .
who ordered them that far back ?
orders came down from the warning center from commander hale .
hale ? from the coast guard ?
affirmative .
thank you , dispatch .
it was him .
he knew the warning system , the evacuation protocol ,
and he had access to russell .
what do you think the odds are that he was with the 14th when
that bust went down ?
okay , he was playing us this morning ,
captain america out to protect the coastlines .
i don &apos;t like being played .
we need to call the coast guard , tell them
they &apos;re gonna take down one of their own today .
that &apos;s him right there .
hey , hands , hands , hands !
what the hell are you doing ?
we &apos;re supposed to be getting out of the evac zone .
shut up !
got a scratch , right on the money .
all right , hands on the truck right now !
hands on the truck right now !
your buddy dunphy tell you about his hit @-@ and @-@ run this morning ?
what &apos;s going on here ? we have to clear this area right now .
that &apos;s i &apos;ve been telling them .
game &apos;s over , hale .
we know there &apos;s no tsunami ,
and we know what you &apos;re after .
this guy walks out the front door of hpd
with millions of dollars in confiscated drug money .
that &apos;s ridiculous ! i have no idea what you &apos;re talking about !
then you won &apos;t mind us taking a look
in the back of your truck .
you &apos;re making a big mistake , commander mcgarrett .
are we done here now ?
because if it &apos;s okay with you ,
i &apos;d like to get back to my job evacuating the city .
after which i look forward to having a nice , long chat
with the governor about this incident .
recognize this ?
we found one just like it outside of dr. russell &apos;s house .
it &apos;s a sandbag . there are thousands everywhere .
yes , there are .
that &apos;s smart .
wait till the disaster &apos;s been averted ,
everybody &apos;s relieved , the cleanup &apos;s underway ,
and then you come back and you collect .
coast guard tracked that drug deal for six months .
it was supposed to be our takedown ,
but then hpd swooped in ,
took the credit .
now i &apos;m being pushed out before my 20,
no pension , no benefits .
my country owes me .
hey , let &apos;s clear one thing up right now .
you swore to support and defend this country ,
no matter what the cost .
she doesn &apos;t owe you anything , okay ?
this , uh ...
could be our last chance to say it . go on .
book him , danno .
how much money is this ?
it &apos;s $ 28 million .
it was .
lost again !
hey , babe .
daddy !
what are you doing , taking everybody &apos;s dough ?
yeah ? good girl .
thank you , brother .
what are you looking at ? we &apos;re all in this together .
lieutenant commander , she &apos;s ready for you .
the governor only wants mcgarrett .
listen , whatever happens , none of us
would &apos;ve done anything any different , all right ?
yeah .
she wanted to thank us .
actually , she wanted to , uh ,
to congratulate us on another job well done .
i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m sorry , what ?
all right , what about the money ?
$ 28 million .
it &apos;s all present and accounted for .
wh @-@ whoa . i don &apos;t understand .
