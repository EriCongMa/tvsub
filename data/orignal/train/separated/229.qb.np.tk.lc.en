gossip girl here--
your one and only source
into the scandalous lives of manhattan &apos;s elite .
jonathan karp called .
he got an advance copy of next week &apos;s best seller list .
did i go up at all ?
you dropped off the list .
there must be some way i can convince you
to write a blog for the &quot; spectator . &quot;
i wanna take &quot; gossip girl &quot; down .
i wish i could explain better ,
but i can &apos;t .
know that i never meant to hurt you .
oh , my god .
the &quot; girl &quot; you &apos;re seeing is our boss ?
now you know
and so does the rest of the world .
nate &apos;s mine .
you were taking money
to reveal confidential information about me .
if you don &apos;t believe me ,
you should ask your fiance .
he &apos;s the one who paid her .
what &apos;s scaring me is that you &apos;re changing into him .
i &apos;m sorry i lost my temper
the night you told me louis proposed to you .
i &apos;m sorry i treated you like property ...
i &apos;m sorry i didn &apos;t tell you i loved you when i knew it .
but most of all ,
i &apos;m sorry that i gave up on us when you never did .
blair ?
louis , what took you so long ?
what are you doing here ?
louis &apos; not coming .
are you thirsty ?
shall i serve you up there ?
no . i &apos;ll come down ...
just so i can go find louis .
let me help .
how do i know i can trust you ?
you can .
good morning , upper east siders .
or is it ?
we hear a certain future royal
has had more than one rude awakening this week .
uh @-@ oh . mr. chuck in dream again ?
when chuck &apos;s in them , they &apos;re all nightmares .
what he do now ?
behave like a perfect gentleman ,
which makes him even more chilling .
that fake apology of his
has permeated my subconscious
and haunts me even when i sleep .
apology not seem so fake to me .
that &apos;s because english is your second language .
as the wedding draws closer ,
he &apos;s trying to make me question my decision to choose louis .
but i have no questions .
and with louis in italy overseeing trade negotiations ,
i &apos;m not going to let anything interrupt my week of
relaxation , nesting , and serenity ...
especially not chuck bass &apos; faux @-@ lanthropy .
or his attention @-@ seeking love of animals .
grab the bread .
not even chuck &apos;s media mind games
can disrupt the calm i feel while feeding the ducks .
besides , you could use the exercise .
i &apos;m pregnant , too , remember ?
please tell me you &apos;re not just getting home from yesterday .
did you spend all night with zarkana again or what ?
early morning charity event meeting .
is that what you &apos;re calling it now--charity ?
wait . seriously ?
being decent is more of a struggle than i thought .
if i keep busy doing good ,
then there &apos;s less of a chance
i &apos;ll find myself in a situation which triggers old habits .
yeah , well , i have faith in you .
i could use some time on the straight and narrow myself--
at least away from anyone who might tempt me .
i thought things with you and diana were going well .
you two were all the talk of the papers last week .
isn &apos;t going public what you wanted ?
yeah , except that it hasn &apos;t changed a thing .
i mean , we don &apos;t leave her house or the office ,
and it &apos;s just sex and work all the time .
same as before .
if diana won &apos;t commit to you in private
like she does in public ,
maybe it &apos;s time to explore your options .
monkey !
how &apos;s the book tour going ?
uh , where are you now ? nashua ?
uh , i &apos;m in--no , i &apos;m in burlington , vermont .
you don &apos;t sound so sure .
ah , you know how it is on the road .
all stops start to-- start to blend together .
it &apos;s been great so far , though .
i knew it would be .
people who still go to bookstores are real readers .
they don &apos;t care if a book &apos;s on some best @-@ whatever list .
yeah . it--it seems that way .
uh , turnout &apos;s been great .
charlie , serena , um , care to join us for a 2011 version
of a family breakfast ?
we don &apos;t want to be late .
you know what ? i should be going anyway .
i gotta meet alessandra soon .
that was awkward .
ugh , long story .
bring us back some real maple syrup .
which i hope i can read about on your new blog .
i know you &apos;ve been posting ,
but i haven &apos;t been able to check it out yet .
that &apos;s the problem . no one has .
i know diana wants me to write about myself ,
but i don &apos;t know what to say .
i now realize why gossip girl is anonymous
and only takes shots at other people .
maybe it &apos;s none of my business ,
but it seems that if you want people to read you ,
and you need people to read about you first .
get gossip girl &apos;s attention--
even a date would do it--
then steal her thunder
by telling the real story on your blog .
you know , you may be an evil genius .
when i want to be .
i know you &apos;re not happy ,
but it &apos;s what i needed to do to keep him here .
trust me .
if we &apos;re gonna take down &quot; gossip girl , &quot; it &apos;s necessary .
don &apos;t worry .
i won &apos;t lose nate or serena .
just give me a bit more time .
i &apos;ve been thinking about you all week .
why have you been avoiding me ?
look , i have a boyfriend . okay ?
i don &apos;t believe you .
well , you have a girlfriend .
yeah , who schedules time with me as if it were a board meeting .
and who &apos;s my boss .
well , maybe i want something more .
if you want more , ask for it .
charlie !
my office .
and do us both a favor and ask her , not me .
well , there must be some mistake .
we just spoke to him from vermont .
yeah , of course . we &apos;ll let you know if we hear anything .
what &apos;s going on ? is dan okay ?
i &apos;m not sure .
that was his agent , alessandra . she says he missed
his book signing in boston yesterday ,
and he didn &apos;t check in to burlington either .
can &apos;t find him anywhere .
isn &apos;t this nice ?
we &apos;re communing with nature , finding our inner peace ,
and i &apos;ll still make my afternoon prenatal massage .
slow news cycle ?
thank you , arthur .
what are you doing here ?
our treaty of 2010 clearly states
the duck pond is my domain .
don &apos;t try to fool me with your puppy dog eyes .
i apologize for the intrusion ,
but your limp @-@ winged friend here waddled into the dog park
and was about to become a labrador &apos;s lunch .
and out of the goodness of your heart ,
you came to his rescue .
i like duck l &apos;orange as much as the next person ,
but it seemed cruel to let the poor creature suffer .
mm , especially in front of a photographer .
what a lucky duck .
i &apos;ve imposed on your domain long enough already .
if you &apos;ll excuse me , monkey needs his constitutional .
how much more do you need to see ?
of duck pond ?
it not really my thing to begin with .
of chuck trying to manipulate me
into believing he &apos;s become a good person .
he knows perfectly well i chose louis .
he endorsed my decision .
but now for reason ,
he &apos;s trying to make me second @-@ guess myself .
i can &apos;t allow it .
this does not sound like week of serenity to me .
he &apos;s forced my hand .
i must expose chuck as a fraud
who &apos;s only pretending to evolve
so he can win me back
before louis comes home .
in drama ,
there are many ways to unmask a villain .
i need to start a war between serena and gossip girl .
stay on her and let me know what happens .
of course .
regarding nate ,
i thought i told you to keep your distance .
you &apos;re not gonna want to hear this , but ...
that ... was all him .
maybe you should loosen up a little ,
not be on him all the time ?
i think i &apos;ll pass on the unsolicited romantic advice ,
thank you .
just make sure serena &apos;s all over &quot; gossip girl . &quot;
diana ...
i would never do anything to jeopardize where i am right now .
i finally have a life here .
i &apos;m not gonna screw that up ,
especially for a guy .
sometimes you know who the bad guy is from the start .
are you okay ?
yeah . i &apos;m sorry . i think that was my fault .
no , not true . i was-- i was blinded by the maps .
do you live in this building ?
no , i work here . can i help you find something ?
i &apos;m looking for my ex @-@ girlfriend , ivy dickens .
do you know her ?
no , i &apos;m sorry .
i think she ...
but most times ,
you find out they &apos;ve been right in front of you
all along .
right . that &apos;s all for now .
let &apos;s reconvene after lunch . thanks .
you look like you wanna say something .
look , i guess i &apos;m just a little confused .
about ?
us . i mean , diana , what are we ?
what do you want us to be ?
i &apos;m not sure anymore ,
but i &apos;m starting to think we won &apos;t be anything
if we keep mixing work and pleasure .
maybe i should start looking for another job .
i get it .
working together , going home together--
it &apos;s all too much .
why don &apos;t we take a couple of days off ?
i &apos;m going to paris tonight anyway .
maybe you should have some fun while i &apos;m gone ,
without the pressure of me on top of you all the time ?
so to speak .
is that your way of saying that we &apos;re not--
we &apos;re not exclusive ?
if that works for you , it works for me .
i just want you to be happy .
you &apos;re my right @-@ hand man .
i can &apos;t afford to lose you .
these not look like happy nursery decorations .
i can &apos;t rest until i can prove chuck
is still his satanic self .
what do you think would be more effective--
having his shirts pressed with too much starch
or getting him served blended scotch
at the empire bar ?
what this test testing exactly ?
we &apos;ll be there , in clever disguises , of course ,
to see him eviscerate the dry cleaner
or fire the bartender , thus proving
that he &apos;s only pretending to be magnanimous when he knows
that i &apos;ll be there or will see it in the press .
you sure you not just do this
because you and prince louis not in a good place right now ?
i admit our relationship has seen stronger days .
and , yes , while it &apos;s true that i was upset with louis
and his momentary lapse of morality ,
he only did what he did out of love ,
and i forgave him .
but i simply cannot have chuck chucking with my head .
so i have to prove this to him and myself .
so what do you think , starch or scotch ?
i &apos;m sorry that security guard was no help .
that &apos;s okay . i didn &apos;t come to new york to find ivy anyway .
really ? i had this whole soul mates reuniting story
worked up in my head .
not quite .
just have some of her stuff to give back to her .
actually , uh , i &apos;m in town for a job interview
i have in two hours .
you know , db bistro is looking for a new line cook .
wow . well , you must be a really talented chef
to even get an interview there .
it &apos;s a huge deal .
if i can find my way there .
well , why don &apos;t i show you ?
you--you don &apos;t have to do that .
well , i &apos;ve actually been suffering from writer &apos;s block lately ,
so a walk might do just the trick .
you up for some company ...
max .
cool . serena , by the way . i just have to take this .
one second . hey .
please tell me the reason you &apos;re still not at work
is because you met a cute guy in a business suit .
well , no suit , but definitely cute .
sounds perfect .
i &apos;m about to walk him to his interview now .
no ! forget that . you need to take him to lunch--
someplace fabulous
where you can be seen by people that read &quot; gossip girl . &quot;
like , um , that place you took me--bg .
i don &apos;t know . i just don &apos;t want to make him late , though .
i expect to read all about you .
bye .
bye .
who &apos;s the guy ?
some nobody she found on the street .
gossip girl will love it , trust me .
now you &apos;re off to bergdorf &apos;s to get that picture .
make your e @-@ mail to gossip girl as depressing as you can .
maybe she &apos;ll post it verbatim .
hey , charlie .
i can &apos;t talk now .
it &apos;ll only take a second .
unless you wanna get me fired ,
you need to stop talking to me here .
i just wanted to make sure he didn &apos;t check out . thank you .
well , the hotel in boston says he &apos;s still checked in .
well , maybe he just fell asleep .
remember when you used to tour ?
we didn &apos;t know if we were in norway or denmark ,
never mind what time the show started .
sure , but we always managed to get make the stage .
and i know dan .
it &apos;s not like him to skip out on an obligation .
and i know you .
what time would you like to leave for boston ?
the morris minor is in the parking lot in brooklyn .
it &apos;d be faster to drive .
why are you still following me , nate ?
you said you didn &apos;t wanna talk at the office .
hey , come on . you &apos;re a rhodes .
if you had a boyfriend ,
the whole upper east side would know about it .
and what about diana , who you might not think you &apos;re dating
but who thinks she &apos;s dating you ?
i &apos;m not so sure that &apos;s true anymore .
that &apos;s where we &apos;re going ?
so when girls like you say &quot; lunch , &quot;
they really mean clothes ?
there &apos;s a restaurant inside .
are you sure we have enough time for this
before the interview ?
i am relying on you to be my official guide
to getting around manhattan .
you know what ? i , um ...
i probably did miscalculate time .
you should go .
go to 6th avenue and make a left . it &apos;s on 44th .
i &apos;m sorry .
oh , and you should try to work apricots in somehow .
boulud is obsessed with them .
wait . where are you going ?
will you just admit that you &apos;re not dating anyone
and that you like me ?
just a little bit ,
and we can see what happens ?
i mean , i &apos;m a pretty good judge on things like this ,
and , you know , when you kissed me last week ,
there was a lot of chemistry between us , and i know--
i mean , that &apos;s what i was talking about .
uh @-@ oh , charlie .
looks like you &apos;ve stayed in character all too well .
too bad there &apos;s always an understudy
waiting in the wings for you to slip and fall .
&quot; nate archibald &apos;s cougar and her cub in pride war &quot;
are you purposely trying to make a fool of me ?
i told you it was an emergency .
to hide from max , your mysteriously reappeared ex ?
i do think it seems a tad convenient
that the only way to do that was to snog nate .
look , i don &apos;t know why max is here ,
but if he finds me , i could lose everything .
fine . i &apos;ll take over that side of things
and get your ex out of our hair .
you focus on proving to nate that you do not
nor will you ever have any romantic interest in him .
understood ?
thank you .
just let me know what you want me to do .
oh , it &apos;s very simple .
you &apos;re gonna ask nate out on a date .
they &apos;re voting on &quot; gossip girl &quot;
and in a surprisingly positive turn for the 21st century ,
the cougar is winning ,
but it appears you chose the cub .
i didn &apos;t choose anything .
diana tells me she wants to take some time off ,
then charlie just kissed me and ran .
i mean , i thought we left stuff like that behind in high school .
maybe we &apos;re maturing too fast .
which is why you &apos;re back to playing
&quot; phantom of the opera &quot; sex games ?
the mask is from a benefit performance
of &quot; sleep no more &quot; i &apos;m sponsoring tonight .
the whole audience wears them .
oh , yeah , i heard about that .
it &apos;s kinda like , uh , &quot; macbeth &quot; in an old hotel , right ?
and the audience can follow the performers
from room to room ?
and since the set is 100,000 square feet
and pretty much in the dark .
it provides the perfect opportunity to disappear for a night .
and avoid any run @-@ ins with blair ,
which may set back my recent progress .
care to join ? i can get you a ticket .
looks like i won &apos;t need one .
陪我去吗 -查莉
why is it when you don &apos;t want gossip girl to post about you ,
she does constantly ,
and when you do , silence .
i share your frustration .
ever her &quot; chuck bass spotted &quot; page is broken .
not one blip . he &apos;s off the map .
wait . why are you looking for chuck ?
i have no choice .
he &apos;s trying to destroy my relationship with louis
because he knows it &apos;s vulnerable .
i &apos;m pretty sure the only war chuck is waging
is with his own demons .
he &apos;s hired a new therapist .
he &apos;s focusing on his businesses .
he &apos;s even throwing a benefit tonight for charity .
oh , no . he got to you , too ?
chuck may be sponsoring a performance ,
but it &apos;s only because in the dark with his mask on ,
he is safe to reveal his true self .
b , whatever you &apos;re thinking , stop .
just work on your relationship with louis .
and let chuck work on himself .
meanwhile , i &apos;m gonna stay home and work on my blog .
well , how hard can that be ?
and if you write about how many strokes it takes
to brush your hair , people will read it .
i &apos;ll pitch that to diana now .
you know , charlie told me
that she didn &apos;t think anyone would read my blog
unless i was on gossip girl &apos;s radar again .
well , i always thought you were too good to blog .
just tell diana it &apos;s not for you .
well , i think you &apos;re too good to scheme .
so if i talk to diana ,
you &apos;ll leave chuck alone ?
absolutely . go talk to diana .
good luck .
hello . this is blair waldorf .
i was hoping you had a ticket left for tonight &apos;s performance .
diana .
hey . i am so grateful for all your help last week .
why do i feel you &apos;re about to break up with me ?
i &apos;m not willing to sell myself or anyone else out
to attract an audience .
everyone sells themselves , serena .
it &apos;s just how you do it that matters .
i don &apos;t think you understand .
i &apos;ve been trying so hard to get off &quot; gossip girl . &quot;
today i almost hurt an innocent stranger
to--to make you happy .
it just-- it didn &apos;t feel right .
and the worst part is he actually seemed like a good guy ,
and now i &apos;ll probably never see him again .
oh , my ... gosh .
max , we were just talking about you .
looks like you spoke too soon .
we met this morning . he , uh , was looking for his ex
who apparently works in the building .
diana .
i &apos;m sorry . i hope i &apos;m not interrupting .
not at all . please stay .
so i just wanted to let you know that i got a second interview
with boulud himself thanks to your apricot tip .
oh , that &apos;s--that &apos;s great .
that was really nice of you to-- to track me down
just to tell me that .
well , seeing as you helped your friend max get a job ,
you two should celebrate . get a bite to eat .
show him the city .
isn &apos;t your friend throwing a benefit tonight ?
you know , that-- that actually ... could be fun .
what do you think ?
i &apos;m in .
great .
why don &apos;t you rush home and get changed ,
and i &apos;ll give max all the details .
and you can meet him there ?
i can &apos;t wait .
me , too .
seems &quot; the play &apos;s the thing &quot; tonight .
but watch out , players .
you might be the ones getting played .
welcome all , to the mckittrick hotel .
the card you were handed upon your arrival
is your ticket .
if you find yourself holding an ace ,
please take the door to your left and enjoy .
no talking .
no photos .
no phones .
feel free to explore ,
follow , watch ,
curiosity shall be rewarded .
you must remain masked at all times .
not nice to steal .
thanks for the invite . i wasn &apos;t sure what to think
after you ran off this afternoon .
and , listen ,
if you &apos;re worried about getting in trouble at work ,
diana &apos;s off to paris , and we will be wearing masks .
you know , i &apos;m just a little anxious about the performance .
it &apos;s dark in there and crowded .
um ... i &apos;m gonna get a glass of water
before we go in .
would you just wait for me here ?
yeah , sure .
that was good .
well , it would be better if you would just tell me your plan .
i don &apos;t feel comfortable stringing nate along .
well , i had planned just to catch you two together here ,
making nate feel so guilty ,
he came running back to apologize ,
but ... something better struck me .
deuces ? all deuces may now enter .
hey , you ready ?
i hope so .
diana , thanks again for the tickets .
is serena here yet ?
oh , you just missed her .
they called her card , and she had to go in .
but she told me to tell you to find her .
she &apos;s wearing a beautiful gold dress .
you can &apos;t miss her .
great . have fun .
i intend to .
you really think pillows under covers trick me ?
you lumpier now .
you can &apos;t expect me to sit on my pregnant laurels
while chuck gets away with a secret double life .
but you tell miss serena--
that i wouldn &apos;t undermine chuck ,
but that &apos;s completely different
than revealing his authentically evil self .
maybe you need to face fact mr. chuck really is good .
never . that &apos;s what he wants you to think
so he can destroy everything in secret .
look !
there &apos;s famous polish film director agnieszka holland .
where ?
where ?
i know you suggested being fashionably late ,
but maybe i overdid it .
not to worry . max hasn &apos;t even arrived yet .
oh , i hope he didn &apos;t get lost again .
maybe i should go look for him .
women like us don &apos;t do things like that .
just wait here . i &apos;m sure he &apos;s just running behind .
i &apos;d better get in .
they called queens some time ago .
can you do me a favor ?
nate .
hi .
oh , my god . i &apos;m not even sure how we lost each other ,
but one minute i &apos;m at this massive feast ,
the next , i &apos;m in this freaky psych ward .
there was this nurse--
well , i &apos;m glad you &apos;re safe .
where do you want to head to next ?
uh , you know what ?
actually , i heard that the experience is even better
if you stay split up , so why don &apos;t you go find the witches ?
they &apos;re awesome , and i think i see lady macbeth .
diana , what are you doing here ?
i thought you were in paris .
well , i decided it was , um , more important
to spend time with you .
that &apos;s really sweet and unexpected ,
but i &apos;m here with someone . i &apos;m sorry .
yeah , charlie . i know . i saw you both come in .
i have to say , i was surprised .
you said we weren &apos;t exclusive .
neither is she , apparently .
you know she &apos;s seeing someone , right ?
yeah , she mentioned something about that ,
but i &apos;m pretty sure she was just making it up .
well , then maybe they broke up .
because last i heard ,
she felt he wasn &apos;t paying her enough attention ,
and she was trying to remedy that .
anyway ...
i won &apos;t bother you anymore .
i just hope you &apos;re not part of that plan .
final group is going inside now .
don &apos;t you wanna join them ?
oh , no , thanks . i &apos;m--i &apos;m waiting for someone .
who it seems isn &apos;t coming .
... beguile the time . look like the time .
bear welcome in your eyes ,
your hands , your tongue ...
blair ?
of course you knew it was me .
was it my perfume ?
i should get back to the performance .
you can &apos;t disrupt the drama .
looks like we &apos;re stuck ... together ...
alone ... amongst the masked and anonymous .
do you remember when we used to play dress @-@ up ?
how could i forget ?
though i didn &apos;t think
this was your kind of entertainment anymore .
at least i know i &apos;m safe , locked in here
with the new chuck bass who has none of his old urges .
i have to admit ,
i had a hard time believing you at first ,
but now i see--
the therapy , the apology--
you really have changed .
as warm as it &apos;s getting in here ,
i can sweep the hair from the nape of my neck
without setting you off .
it &apos;s such a relief ...
to be able to ... let my guard down .
they even have red hots .
mmm . you never could resist .
do you want one ?
no , but thank you .
no one is looking .
even the new chuck bass must still have some
of his darkest desires .
just a taste .
are you ready , charlie ?
there &apos;s nate .
go kiss him .
ivy ?
max .
it &apos;s been the performance of a lifetime
for cousin charlie , but tonight ,
it looks like it just might be the final curtain .
i knew you were still the same chuck .
you thought by one fake apology and a few charitable acts ,
that you could get me to question
all the reasons i &apos;m with louis ,
but i was right .
you are incapable of change .
seems you know me too well .
and now , thanks to you , i &apos;m more certain than ever
that i chose the right man . good @-@ bye .
good @-@ bye , blair .
i can &apos;t remember the last time i drove it ,
but it died as soon as i pulled out of the garage .
yeah , thanks .
well , just let me know when it &apos;s ready ,
and i &apos;ll head back .
yeah , i need to get on the road tonight .
bye @-@ bye .
dan ?
one more ?
no , thank you .
are you okay ?
i just saw the &quot; gossip girl &quot; blast .
&quot; serena van der who ?
last girl standing , or simply stood up &quot; &quot;
she is so heartless and humiliating .
oh , this is nothing
compared to when she called me
&quot; irrelevant &quot; at graduation
or when she lied to the world that i had an s.t.d.
this is exactly why we need to work together ...
on your blog .
so gossip girl loses her readers ,
and her attacks lose their power .
or i just develop a thicker skin ,
which is what i &apos;ve done over the years .
it just upsets me when she goes after people
that aren &apos;t strong enough to defend themselves .
i should probably go .
see you tomorrow .
okay .
bye @-@ bye .
well , it turns out you were right about charlie .
i &apos;m sorry . i didn &apos;t want to see you get hurt ,
even though i can see how much i &apos;ve hurt you myself .
how can you hurt me ?
i &apos;m your right @-@ hand man , after all .
you &apos;re more than that .
last week , i told everyone you were my boyfriend
not because you wanted me to , but because i wanted to .
i care about you .
well , then why didn &apos;t you just tell me that earlier ?
because i didn &apos;t think that was what you wanted to hear .
although judging from tonight ,
maybe you &apos;d rather be with someone else .
think about it .
let me know .
it was one thing to-- to feel like my book
wasn &apos;t exactly appreciated in the upper east side .
i expected that . but--
but then the readings on the tour--
i mean , they--you know , they were less and less full .
in hartford , i think , like ten people showed up ,
and half of them were there to get out of the rain .
my book is a failure , dad .
i &apos;m--i &apos;m a failure .
you &apos;re not a failure .
when i started touring with lincoln hawk ,
we didn &apos;t even have a--
a bus , a roadie ,
an amp that didn &apos;t create massive feedback .
i know . i &apos;ve heard this more than once .
yeah , but what you don &apos;t know about this tour
is how many times we played for a handful of people .
in marfa , texas ,
our entire audience was a bartender .
yeah , but that bartender-- he spoke to his friends ,
and they told their friends ,
and soon we were selling out .
it just takes one person to connect with your art ,
who feels like you directly communicated with them
to start a groundswell .
but you can &apos;t connect with that person
unless you show up .
thank you , dad .
i think , uh , i think i needed to hear that .
what are you doing in new york ?
in town for a job interview .
what &apos;s really weird is what you &apos;re doing here .
what the hell just happened back there ?
i recognized you .
let &apos;s get outta here , catch up .
i &apos;m here with someone .
in fact , i thought you were her when you kissed me .
i should really go find her . her name &apos;s serena .
serena van der woodsen ?
do you know her ?
everyone in new york knows her--of her .
well , i &apos;d like to get to know her better ,
so i &apos;m gonna go find her .
please don &apos;t .
fate brought us back together for a reason .
i miss you .
i made a mistake in l.a. , and i &apos;ll tell you all about it
if you just come with me .
i &apos;m not gonna drop everything because you tell me to , ivy .
you walked out on me .
you knew it was max behind that mask , didn &apos;t you ?
i told you we were going to show nate for the last time
that you were the wrong choice for him .
why would you use max when you said
that you would help me get rid of him ?
i found a better plan ,
and i like watching you squirm .
but ... let me put you out of your misery .
you &apos;re fired .
what ?
clearly , your ex is going to out your secret .
please don &apos;t do this .
it &apos;s already done , and now ...
so are we .
oh , wait .
one last piece of business .
a quick picture for &quot; gossip girl &quot; &quot;
and then serena is in place .
oh , come on--
ohh . perfection .
what name shall i use when i send it in--
ivy or charlie ?
doesn &apos;t matter . i &apos;ll surprise you .
all masks eventually have to come off ,
and with them , so do the gloves .
dorota , i hope you &apos;ve learned your lesson .
i will always be right about
charles bartholomew bass ,
and now that i &apos;ve proven i made the right choice with louis ,
tomorrow we can get back to my restful week of prenatal pampering
before i welcome my fiance home with open arms .
so i don &apos;t get it .
you kissed blair so she &apos;d think you hadn &apos;t changed ?
the only way for blair to move on
is if she thinks i never will .
i had to kiss her to set her free .
that may be the most selfless thing you &apos;ve ever done .
i &apos;ve never been more good and less happy about it .
and what of your happiness , archibald ?
was there a clear winner in the war for your heart ?
my heart was always in the same place .
i realized it was my head that was being messed with ,
so i &apos;ve decided to make my own decisions
instead of letting everyone else pull my strings .
starting now , i see .
you wanted to see me ?
yeah , i did .
lock your windows , upper east siders .
looks like serena &apos;s cuckoo cousin charlie
is off her meds again
and about to jump to her own conclusion .
what are you doing here ?
what happened to your date ?
my date stood me up .
what happened to you ?
i saw &quot; gossip girl . &quot;
i know i shouldn &apos;t let her get to me like this ,
but ...
i feel like she &apos;s after me
or ... on to something .
maybe i took on too much too fast when i came back .
i told diana i quit .
i think maybe
i ... should just go home .
no , no , don &apos;t let &quot; gossip girl &quot; bully you .
come on . you have to rise above it .
everything is so fragile right now .
if i make one false move , my whole world collapses .
don &apos;t leave . come on .
whatever you &apos;re feeling , let me help you .
we &apos;re family .
i &apos;m so sorry for what i said today .
you don &apos;t need to be seen with some guy
to define who you are .
don &apos;t worry . i know that .
i don &apos;t think i &apos;ll ever see that guy again anyway .
but i &apos;m not alone . i have you , right ?
come here .
i have to go make a quick call ,
then we &apos;ll hang out and chat more , okay ?
sure .
we all wear different masks for different reasons .
nate , you matter to me ... a lot .
i was just trying to be cool .
you know , that &apos;s my thing ,
although i &apos;m beginning to see i may need a new ... thing .
from now on , equals .
just us , together , seeing what happens .
you can take it .
are you sure ?
because right now you &apos;re my priority , not business .
it &apos;s fine .
i &apos;ll get the champagne .
hello , serena . everything okay ?
not exactly . you know , it &apos;s one thing
when gossip girl tries to humiliate me ,
but when she goes after someone like charlie ...
ohh . i hadn &apos;t seen &quot; gossip girl . &quot;
what &apos;s she done ?
just what she &apos;s done a thousand times before ,
and i &apos;m sick of it . i &apos;m ready to help you bring her down .
well , i &apos;m sorry for the circumstances
that brought you to this decision .
i &apos;m looking forward to working with you on this .
see you at 9 : 00 .
i &apos;ll be there .
some masks we put on
because it &apos;s truly who we want to be .
some we wear because we can &apos;t bear to face
what &apos;s really underneath ...
or because it &apos;s what someone else needs us to be .
everything &apos;s set .
good . very good .
you should never have doubted me .
you &apos;ve done a fine job rehabilitating my grandson &apos;s image .
he &apos;s right where i need him to be .
and serena &apos;s right where we need her , too .
always a pleasure working with you , william .
and some masks we wear because we hope to stay hidden .
but that &apos;s the problem with wearing masks .
they can be ripped off at any moment .
