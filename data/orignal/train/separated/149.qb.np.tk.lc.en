gossip girl here--
your one and only source
into the scandalous lives of manhattan &apos;s elite .
don &apos;t you think it &apos;s time for you to head home ?
i am home .
no , i mean your other home , the one with your wife in it .
&quot; as for the rest of my estate , i leave to you ,
ivy dickens . &quot;
you are never gonna get away with this .
you don &apos;t have a case . i didn &apos;t do anything wrong .
the court will decide that .
our relationship is not choosing one world or another .
our relationship is our world . we &apos;re a team .
serena &apos;s gossip girl . i &apos;m gonna prove it to you .
you saved chuck &apos;s life ,
and you did that because ...
i &apos;m chuck &apos;s mother .
you &apos;re actually her . you &apos;re gossip girl .
please , whatever you do ,
just don &apos;t tell anyone .
it &apos;s one thing to accuse serena of being gossip girl .
but sending in that video about chuck ?
i can &apos;t forgive that .
i &apos;ve always hesitated going after lola &apos;s father
for child support .
do you even know who he is ?
i &apos;m looking right at him .
what if my dad doesn &apos;t even know i exist ?
what if all he &apos;d want is to know me ?
i &apos;m sure he does .
you know you love me .

in our modern age ,
there are so many ways for information to travel .
and yet , with all our tablets and smartphones ,
there are still some people
who like to get their morning dish the old @-@ fashioned way .
even without the information highway ,
good news always seems to travel fast .
but bad news ?
well , you know what they say ...
you know , i must commend myself
on my choice of wardrobe for you today .
you are striking just the right tone of literate and serious yet
playful and accessible .
i &apos;m just meeting a couple of simon &amp; schuster publicists .
it &apos;s really not a big deal .
not a big deal ? what could be more important
than strategizing ways to publicize yourself ?
i don &apos;t know . maybe the banking crisis or--
or what &apos;s going on in syria or--
dan , we know you &apos;re never gonna be trending on twitter
if you choose those topics to discuss .
now just be humble , self @-@ deprecating ,
with a tinge of intellectual superiority .
and always leave them wanting more .
have a great day !
dorota !
run me a hot bath .
i want a long soak in the tub and catch up on my reading .
i have better idea .
how about you take quick shower ,
then supervise me as i clean out your closet ?
you need more space ,
and i @-@ i @-@ i need to work off baby weight bad .
did you see the look on ivy &apos;s face
when mother &apos;s nurse accused her
of &quot; taking unfair advantage of the weak and elderly &quot; ?
well , thank god that woman came forward
and said what actually happened .
i knew right then that the judge would invalidate the will .
tell me , lily .
how much exactly did you pay that nurse to lie for you ?
&apos;cause i have done nothing but love and care for cece .
it &apos;s not my mom &apos;s fault that the truth finally came out .
so why don &apos;t you leave us alone
before we head into one of these offices
and file a restraining order against you ?
hey , mom . where was rufus this morning ?
i was kinda surprised he wasn &apos;t here to support you .
well , rufus had an appointment ,
and i just told him not to cancel
because as long as you were by my side , i &apos;d be fine .
so what happens now ?
the money just reverts back to you ?
well , now that the will has been revoked ,
the estate will be split 50 @-@ 50 between me and carol .
and she &apos;s flying in tonight to sign the paperwork .
there &apos;ll be gloating , no doubt .
well , believe me , it &apos;s a small price to pay
to be done with this whole thing .
and thank god nobody knew how dirty it really got .
here she comes !
lily ! lily ! is the family still fighting with each other
over your mother &apos;s inheritance ?
how &apos;s it feel going from high @-@ class to high @-@ trash ?
well , i assure you , this is all one big misunderstanding .
the entire rhodes clan couldn &apos;t be happier .
any truth to the rumors
that you and your husband are no longer living together ?
no . none at all .
serena , shall we ?
wait , just one more question .
i think you dialed the wrong number .
obviously , you meant to call your son and not me .
i know the news of me being chuck &apos;s mother
must have come as rather a ... big surprise to you .
ya think ?
but it doesn &apos;t have to ruin anything between us .
except for the small fact that
every time i look at you now , i see a bass in my face .
you know i still have feelings for you .
and now that you &apos;ve broken up with that girl lola ,
i think you might still have feelings for me , too .
am i wrong ?
i should really go .
i &apos;m gonna be out of the office all day . but ...
can we meet after work tonight
and at least talk it through ?
i don &apos;t know . i never really saw myself as
a &quot; sleep with your best friend &apos;s mother &quot; kind of a guy .
just think about it , okay ?
all right .
is it true what the paparazzi said about you and rufus ?
are you really not living together ?
well , we &apos;re taking a little hiatus to clear our heads , yes .
why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
well , because i didn &apos;t want to worry you .
rufus is in brooklyn . he &apos;s fine .
and , you know , he &apos;ll come around like he always does .
my bigger concern is the public perception
of this whole mess that ivy caused .
&apos;cause let me tell you something , serena ,
nothing ruins a family reputation faster
than a money fight .
you should be focusing on fixing things with rufus .
i know ! we &apos;ll have a big family dinner here tonight ,
to celebrate our victory in court .
and i &apos;ll invite a reporter from the new york social diary
to dispel all the rumors of family strife .
you think the way to handle this
is by inviting the media into our home ?
i &apos;ll find a way to get rufus here .
you bring lola .
we &apos;re not exactly in a good place right now .
well , get in one . once they see us all together ,
these vicious rumors will evaporate before they began .
nathaniel , are my ears playing tricks on me
or did i hear you on the phone with a young lady earlier ?
no , not exactly . um ...
you mother called to talk to me .
well , i &apos;m not sure which one of us this is more awkward for .
neither am i.
between my history with diana and now yours ,
it &apos;s just too weird to even be in business with her .
i would love to find some funding
and possibly buy her out for good .
you interested ?
unfortunately , i &apos;m still trying to decide
what kind of relationship i want with her .
which means i &apos;m not ready to put her out of business just yet .
what you &apos;re saying is , since i already screwed her ...
i don &apos;t need to also .
oh , by the way , i hope you don &apos;t mind .
i called andrew in
to figure out where diana &apos;s getting her money .
she needed my grandfather last time .
someone must be bankrolling her now .
and when you find out who it is ?
i &apos;ll try and convince the investor to bet on me alone .
do what you have to do ,
but i am respectfully staying out of it .
andrew .
mr. bass .
i did some digging .
i found out that diana is getting her funding
from an australian holding company .
were you able to find a name ?
andrew , i need you to find out
everything you can about diana payne .
i &apos;ll tell you , dorota ,
for the first time in a long time ,
i feel as if all is right in the universe .
not the dior !
wait .
why did you throw these away ?
i haven &apos;t read &quot; new york &quot; magazine yet .
it &apos;s too much clutter . it clutter your brain .
you sure you want to read , miss blair ?
there are some bad things about friends in there .
don &apos;t you know me at all ?
i love reading bad things about my friends .
it &apos;s the only thing that makes me feel better about myself .

dan made the approval matrix ?
in the highbrow / brilliant box ?
&quot; dan humphrey writing a new book--
one that isn &apos;t a cheap sequel to &apos; inside . &apos; &quot;
that &apos;s brilliant ?
i mean , i &apos;m surprised he made the magazine at all , but ...
上榜理由 : 比金 · 卡戴珊婚姻还短命
he &apos;s highbrow and i &apos;m lowbrow
&quot; for being married for less time than kim kardashian &quot; ?
与克里斯 · 亨弗里斯婚姻短暂仅72天
i was so wrong , dorota . all is not right in the universe .
the universe is totally upended ,
and we must right it immediately .
and how we plan to do that ?
i must become as highbrow as dan this instant .
hello , sweetie .
hey , dad . i @-@ i think i need your help .
for you , anything .
what &apos;s going on ?
word got out about all of our family drama
over grandma &apos;s inheritance ,
and now mom wants to have a big dinner tonight
and--and invite the press to try to fix it .
i don &apos;t know . i just don &apos;t think
that &apos;s the right way to handle it .
this is just your mother &apos;s process .
she needs to make sure
everything looks good on the outside
before she takes care of the inside .
well , is there any way you can make it ?
you &apos;ve been such a calming presence
during all this craziness .
and carol is gonna be there ,
which usually only adds to the conflict .
i wish i could , sweetie ,
but there &apos;s no way i can get into town on such short notice .
but don &apos;t worry .
i promise you , everything is gonna be just fine .
okay . well , thank you anyway .
i love you , dad .
love you , too , angel .
bye .
i &apos;ve always been a daddy &apos;s girl ,
but sometimes the problem with fathers ...
sorry about that . now where were we ?
i think you were about to tell me
how you found out that you &apos;re my dad .
is that they can be real sons of bitches .
how am i supposed to be okay with this ?
my mom knowingly kept me from you all these years .
it may sound crazy , but i think in her ... own way ,
she was just trying to protect everyone .
well , she still should &apos;ve told me about it ,
and then it could &apos;ve been up to you and me
what kind of relationship we wanted to have .
i know in your mind you think we lost a lot of good years , but ...
the truth is ,
i was a lousy dad
to serena and eric .
i think i finally learned from my mistakes .
so instead of looking back and cursing your mother ,
how about we focus on what we can have moving forward ?
now your mom told me not to tell anybody about us ,
but ...
if you &apos;d like everyone to know the truth ,
it &apos;s fine by me .
i think it would be best if we didn &apos;t tell the family just yet .
i won &apos;t say a word .
okay .
have you heard the good news ?
a judge invalidated my mother &apos;s will ,
so we can now finally put all this drama behind us .
now where are the champagne flutes ?
uh , lil ... why are you here ?
well , because we &apos;re having a celebratory dinner
tonight at our place , just the family ,
and i want you to come .
i &apos;m sorry you &apos;re upset with me ,
but i think it &apos;s time we put our petty fighting behind us
and move on .
what do you say ?
i &apos;d say that doesn &apos;t sound like a real apology .
well , i &apos;m not sure i &apos;m the one who needs to apologize .
oh , you think i am ? for what ?
taking ivy &apos;s side , paying her way behind my back ?
she was basically homeless .
that &apos;s because the home she &apos;d been living in was mine .
that &apos;s exactly right , lil .
it was yours , not ours .
do you see what we &apos;re doing here ,
all this fighting and finger pointing ?
i thought we were in this together ,
but you do whatever you feel like .
well , i could say the same thing about you .
this isn &apos;t how a marriage is supposed to be .
who &apos;s wrong ? who &apos;s right ? it doesn &apos;t matter .
what matters is that we &apos;re in a partnership .
i couldn &apos;t agree more .
then how about you give me a call
when you &apos;re ready to be a partner again ?
wow . that must &apos;ve been one quick jet
you took to get you back to new york already .
serena . hello .
do you wanna explain why you lied to me
or why you were hanging out with lola ?
if you must know , i ...
bonded with my niece at cece &apos;s wake .
she &apos;s been a bit lonely with all this stuff
with her mother .
i &apos;m just ... trying to be there for her .
but that still doesn &apos;t explain
why you told me you weren &apos;t in town .
i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s just , you invited me to a family dinner ,
and i heard rumors that lily and rufus are having problems .
as you know , my presence tends to be
the opposite of helpfup around the two of them .
i never should &apos;ve lied to you .
i @-@ i didn &apos;t know what else to say .
well , if you wanna make it up to me ,
why don &apos;t you come to dinner tonight ?
please ? i &apos;m not gonna take &quot; no &quot; for an answer ,
so just say &quot; yes , &quot; dad . for me ?
you convinced me .
thank you .
you know , i &apos;m--i &apos;m gonna invite lola , too .
i &apos;ll see you at mom &apos;s at 8 : 00 , okay ?
great .
yeah , i appreciate that . thanks .
were you able to reach jack ?
no . apparently , he &apos;s taken a leave of absence
from bass australia ,
and no one seems to know where he is .
of course , they say that &apos;s rather normal for jack .
well , you have a visitor . want me to let her in ?
yeah , sure . thanks , amy .
nate , hi .
lola , hey .
i just recently gained insight
into how painful it must &apos;ve been
for chuck to find out that diana was his mom .
and i &apos;m just really sorry for the role i played in that .
oh , yeah , well , thanks for that .
but ... why ? what happened to you ?
my father finally came forward ,
and , um , i just spent the morning with him .
so i really needed someone to talk to .
well , i &apos;m glad you came to me . believe it or not ,
i went through the same thing with chuck
when he thought he found his mother a couple years ago .
another woman besides diana ?
yeah , but it turned out none of it was true .
it was just all this big lie orchestrated by his , um ...
orchestrated by his uncle jack .
hey , lola , i &apos;m--i &apos;m really sorry ,
but i can talk more about this later .
i &apos;ve just gotta deal with something right now .
are you gonna be okay ?
thanks .
hey , amy , would you give me andrew tyler ?
and if you can &apos;t reach him ,
see if you can find any information online
about a woman named elizabeth fisher .
so as i was cleaning out my closet this morning ,
i suddenly had a brilliant--
and highbrow .
thank you , dorota . a brilliant and extremely highbrow idea .
such a shame to have all these beautiful accessories
that are hidden from the world the vast majority of the time .
so i decided to allow f.i.t.
to exhibit my shoe and handbag collection .
this is the purse i brought to prom ,
and , of course ,
that is the shoe that louis brought back to me from paris
in the beginning of our storybook romance .
which ended even more famously than it began , didn &apos;t it ?
maybe if you were still a princess , i &apos;d bite ,
but since you &apos;re no longer royalty ...
she still royalty to me .
down , dorota . it &apos;s okay .
also , it &apos;s far too similar
to an exhibit we already did with daphne guinness .
perhaps another time .
who was that guy ?
some representative from f.i.t.
more like similar word , but spelled &quot; s &quot; --
it doesn &apos;t matter . how was the meeting with your publicist ?
they just wanted to see me in person
so they could tell me i &apos;m one of the five people nominated
for the new york public library &apos;s 2012 young lion in fiction award .
and there &apos;s a cocktail reception tonight
where they &apos;re honoring the nominees .
i was wondering if , uh , if you would be my date .
well , of course .
i can &apos;t wait to be there to honor you ,
my boyfriend ,
who &apos;s doing such highbrow , brilliant things .
in fact , i &apos;m gonna buy a new dress since clearly
nothing is worthwhile in my entire collection .
okay , but it &apos;s a cocktail party .
you can keep it casual .
despite what f.i.t. believes ,
i think i know how to dress myself for an evening out ,
thank you very much .
hey ! have you seen lola ?
i just saw on &quot; gossip girl &quot; that she was here .
oh , you just missed her .
oh . i just left her a message
inviting her to this family dinner tonight ,
but i really wanted to make up with her in person
after our tiff last week .
oh , i &apos;m glad .
lola could really use some friends right about now .
she &apos;s just going through some things , you know ?
unrelated to you , but ...
really ? everything okay ?
she just met her father for the first time today .
she spent the morning with him . i think the whole experience
just kind of threw her for a loop , you know ?
she spent the morning with her father ?
yeah .
nate , no word from andrew yet , but i think i found
that phone number your were asking for .
ah . thanks , amy .
listen , serena , i really need to go deal with this . excuse me .
lily may have wanted the perfect nuclear family ,
but this bomb is going to start a war .
how &apos;s this for tonight &apos;s speech ?
&quot; i learned many things writing this book .
&quot; number one-- don &apos;t exploit your friends . &quot;
&quot; number two--if you are going to exploit your friends ,
uh , you--you should probably tell them about it first . &quot;
i can do better than this .
you know , i &apos;d be happy to accompany you to the event
as your proud father , if you want me to .
okay , what &apos;s going on , dad ?
you haven &apos;t wanted to spend this much time with me
since i wrote a term paper
on british punk rock and the subculture of scorn .
all right , you got me .
lily invited me to this big family dinner tonight ,
and i &apos;m not sure if i wanna go .
well , do i need to remind you that lily &apos;s still your wife ?
don &apos;t tell me you &apos;re on her side .
no , i &apos;m not on any side .
but you gave me some very good advice recently
on the importance of equality in a relationship .
and if lily is taking steps to make things better ,
how can you not at least try to do the same ?
that &apos;s all .
oh , hi .
mom , i know you wanna have
this great family dinner here tonight ,
but you have to cancel .
why ? what happened ?
i just ...
i just found out that lola &apos;s not my cousin ,
but she &apos;s my sister .
which means dad was having an affair with carol
while you were still married .
how did you hear this ?
well , dad lied to me about being out of town ,
and then i saw him with lola .
and--and then nate just told me that lola spent the morning with her father .
well , there still could be some other explanation .
no , no , this is the explanation . it explains everything--
carol hiding lola from us , hiring ivy to be her .
you know in your heart that this is the truth .
serena ...
your father and i divorced for many reasons .
his philandering was just one of them .
nonetheless , we need to handle our present problems
before we start digging into past ones .
are either one of them aware that we know their secret ?
okay , then let &apos;s keep it that way
until after the reporter leaves and dinner is over .
and then i &apos;ll sit down with your father and carol alone
and calmly sort through this in a mature manner .
i want you to put this out of your mind ,
plaster on your best happy face , and go get ready for the party .
will you do that for me ?
if that &apos;s what you want .
i &apos;ll see you in a few hours .
hi . this is lily .
i know i &apos;m probably the last person
you wanna talk to right now ,
but i have a partnership proposition for you .
i &apos;m sorry to leave all this
on your answering machine , elizabeth .
i just really need your help .
i mean , if you have any proof whatsoever
that you are in fact chuck &apos;s real mother ,
and if you care about him even a little bit ,
now would be the time to come forward .
feel free to contact me anytime , day or night .
thank you very much .
what &apos;d you find out ?
that the first record of our &quot; diana payne &quot;
was three years ago .
before that , it &apos;s like she didn &apos;t even exist .
so if diana payne &apos;s not her real name ,
how do we ever find out her story ?
how do i look ?
suspicious .
you heard mr. humphrey .
why you dressed so fancy for casual book party ?
ah , guess the opera gloves may be a bit much .
i smell a scheme when i see one . what &apos;s going on ?
it is very simple , dorota .
after carefully studying back issues of &quot; new york &quot; magazine ,
i realized that i don &apos;t aspire to be anything
like the highbrow / brilliant people at all .
they &apos;re all boring doctors curing diseases
and lame philanthropists trying to save the world .
who wants to be on that list ?
but mr. dan &apos;s not lame .
fine . he is the exception to the rule .
but my point is--
highbrow / despicable .
that &apos;s where you find
the headline makers having all the fun .
gwyneth , victoria beckham ,
mayor bloomberg--
those are my people , dorota ,
and it is time that i become one of them again .
now i have written a list of talking points
for when the press calls later this evening .
&quot; do say blair is generous and impulsive .
don &apos;t say any of this was premeditated . &quot;
you going to steal mr. dan &apos;s spotlight on big night ,
aren &apos;t you ?
that would be merely despicable .
but if i do it while performing
an incredibly honorable and magnanimous deed ,
then it &apos;s highbrow / despicable .
so i was , uh , thinking about what we talked about earlier ,
and i decided that as your husband ,
i &apos;d like to come and support you this evening .
oh , that &apos;s very sweet of you rufus ,
but unfortunately , dinner &apos;s been canceled .
i &apos;ll call you later .
all right , you got me here .
now what kind of a &quot; partnership proposition &quot;
did you have in mind ?
i can work with this .
you can work with what ?
take my coat , will you ?
uh ... you look beautiful ,
but i did tell you this was casual , right ?
this is casual .
be right back .
dorota , why isn &apos;t anything posted on &quot; gossip girl &quot; yet ?
i don &apos;t know . i sent in tip about how your elie saab couture
upstages stodgy lions ten minutes ago ,
just like you said .
well , it isn &apos;t working .
no one &apos;s paying any attention to me .
hey . how you doing ? i &apos;m dan humphrey .
it looks like i &apos;m going to shift into phase two
earlier than i thought .
... on modern class distinctions
and the near ritualistic social mores of the upper east side .
it was almost austenian in nature .
or waldorf @-@ ian ...
being as that i was his muse and inspiration .
and hi . i &apos;m blair waldorf .
hi . blair waldorf .
hi . blair waldorf . hi .
victor , i really appreciate you doing this for me .
the empire just isn &apos;t the same without you , man .
well , i might be back there very soon
if anyone finds out what i just did .
well , i &apos;ll be super quick , i promise .
all right , diana .
reveal yourself .
well , i really appreciate the invitation .
yes , of course . i think it &apos;s very important
for you to see firsthand all this infighting over money
has been just so wildly exaggerated by the press .
you can understand how to an outside eye--
oh , nonsense . the truth is , one bad egg
threatened to tear the whole family apart .
but as you &apos;ll see this evening ,
i would never let that happen .
i &apos;m , um , sorry that my husband won &apos;t be in attendance ,
but he &apos;s feeling a little under the weather . excuse me .
are you all right ? because this isn &apos;t exactly
the happy face that we talked about earlier .
i just still feel a little weird about tonight .
is it too late to cancel ?
darling , it is already happening .
oh , carol !
looking just as great as ever .
hi .
hi . uh , carol , this is
david patrick columbia of the new york social diary .
hi ! nice to meet you .
if you wanted to see my underwear ,
all you had to do was ask .
are you just gonna stand there , staring at me ,
or would you like to tell me
why you &apos;ve broken into my hotel room ?
if you must know , i was ...
looking for something for you to wear .
the truth is , i &apos;ve just been ...
thinking about your call today .
i &apos;m listening .
our chemistry is clearly undeniable .
and ...
i &apos;m just tired of fighting it .
so ... i &apos;m not going to anymore .
good evening , carol .
how are you ?
you can breathe easier now , william .
since i &apos;ve gotten half of my mother &apos;s estate ,
you &apos;re no longer in danger of losing everything anymore .
and our little secret ?
i see no reason to tell anyone else . how about you ?
hello , sweetheart .
you &apos;re looking lovely as ever .
oh , thank you . i get it from my mom .
wow ! look who &apos;s here . can you believe it ?
all of us together in the same room ,
one big happy family .
well , now that our final guest has arrived ,
if you &apos;ll follow me , i know we &apos;re in for quite a meal .
next up to say a few words about his book
and tell us
what the young lions means to him--
dan humphrey .
thank you , deborah .
your brilliant short stories inspire me to write better--
and get to the point quicker .
i believe it was hemingway who once said--
what ...
a wonderful introduction , dan .
i truly could not tell you how moved i was
by all the touching things
you wrote about me in &quot; inside . &quot;
a book can only be read by people who know how to read it .
otherwise , it is nothing more than a paperweight or a doorstop .
which is why i , blair waldorf ,
have decided to provide an endowment
to the young lions fund
to help with children &apos;s literacy ,
so that all the despicable new yorkers out there like me
can one day grow up to read &quot; inside &quot; themselves .
however , as always ,
i prefer to remain anonymous .
so a toast to dan .
and to literacy .
and to me ...
anonymously .
cheers ?
well , in the spirit of the evening ,
i &apos;ve decided to serve tonight &apos;s meal family style .
mom , this is so unlike you .
you hate anything family style .
yes , well , i &apos;ve since realized
how important sharing is
to the family dynamic . us van der woodsens
share more than you could possibly imagine .
yeah , like when you used to steal my leg warmers
when we were teenagers .
yes , just like that , or when you stole my husband
and decided to have a baby with him behind my back .
oh , my god .
mom , why are you doing this now ?
okay , i think david &apos;s seen enough family bonding
for one evening .
no , please , serena , let him stay .
i don &apos;t want there to be any more secrets .
why did you tell lily ?
i never said a word .
lola was never supposed to know about this .
well , maybe if you didn &apos;t want me to know ,
you shouldn &apos;t have tried to blackmail him .
and if it wasn &apos;t bad enough that you slept with my husband
all those years ago and left your daughter
in the dark about her father &apos;s identity ,
then you send an imposter into my home to get money .
you know what ? i don &apos;t need to listen to this any longer .
i got what i came here for--
my half of the inheritance ,
and i &apos;m leaving .
it &apos;s not exactly that easy .
gentlemen ?
what &apos;s going on ?
you &apos;re being arrested for fraud .
ivy is the one who committed fraud , not me .
yes , well , you &apos;re the one that put her up to it ,
so that kinda makes you the mastermind
behind the whole thing .
well , unfortunately for you ,
ivy would never admit that to anyone .
otherwise , she would incriminate herself in the process .
ivy ?
actually , i &apos;ve already given my statement ,
and in exchange for ratting you out ,
i got off scot @-@ free .
uh @-@ oh , carol .
dinner &apos;s over , and it looks like
ivy just served you your last supper .
you realize this isn &apos;t just hurting my mom .
it &apos;s hurting me , too .
your mother deserves to be punished .
she defrauded all of us ,
and we should have done this months ago .
you know , don &apos;t listen to her , lola .
this has nothing to do with fraud .
this is all because i slept with her husband two decades ago .
but here &apos;s the thing , lily .
i never would have been with william in the first place
if he were happy with you .
one tip--
if you want things to go smoothly in the jail ,
put her in solitary .
you know , maybe my mom was right keeping me from you all these years ,
because the truth hasn &apos;t helped anybody .
lola , wait .
let me take you home .
you know i never meant
for any of this to happen , right ?
oh , wow , what &apos;s next ?
you gonna walk her down the aisle ?
wait , wait , wait , wait , wait . where are you going ?
they haven &apos;t even handed out the certificates to the nominees yet .
did you really feel the need to steal the spotlight
from me tonight because i was above you
on the--on the back page of some magazine ?
no , that &apos;s ridiculous .
is it ? &apos; cause you said in your speech
something about me being &quot; brilliant and highbrow , &quot;
and if it &apos;s about that ,
it &apos;s a bit of an overreaction , don &apos;t you think ?
i mean , you know none of that stuff means anything to me .
well , it means something to me ,
and it isn &apos;t just about the magazine .
i don &apos;t wanna live in someone else &apos;s shadow anymore .
i did it the whole year i was with louis ,
and then with chuck before that .
i &apos;m sick of being behind the scenes in a relationship .
you &apos;re not behind @-@ the @-@ scenes with me .
that &apos;s what i love about us .
we are equals in this .
well , that &apos;s not how i feel ,
and it &apos;s clearly not how other people view me .
maybe you are so focused on how everyone else perceives you ,
that you no longer know who you are .
and that &apos;s too bad ,
&apos;cause if you could only see what i see ...
is it safe to assume that you &apos;re ready to , um ,
resume our relationship again ?
what do you say we go downstairs and grab a drink together
and continue exploring our options ?
okay .
actually , diana , i , um , just got a text from chuck .
he &apos;s back home , and he &apos;s , um , wondering where i am .
so if i could just take a rain check on that drink ,
then i &apos;ll just see you at the office .
wait a minute !
serena , give me a minute , please .
hey , look ...
i &apos;m sorry for not being truthful with you today .
and for cheating on your mother all those years ago .
that &apos;s between you and mom ,
but you lied to me today to protect lola .
you left me when i was 4 years old ,
and when i tracked you down ...
you wouldn &apos;t even see me .
all i ever wanted my whole life was a father ,
and all you ever did was avoid me ,
and then now when you find out about lola ,
you just rush to be by her side .
well , you broke my mom &apos;s heart ,
and now you just broke mine .
rufus .
don &apos;t get up . i &apos;m not gonna be long .
apparently , you did have a dinner tonight ,
or so i read from a newsfeed
about you getting your sister arrested .
carol hurt this family too badly to just get away with it .
you sound just like your mother .
well , i &apos;ll take that as a compliment .
my mother would have done anything
to preserve our family name .
no matter the consequences to the actual family members ,
right ?
i &apos;ll bet
you even paid off the nurse to testify against ivy .
you know , i @-@ i thought we &apos;d grown together ,
but if this is who you wanna be ...
i don &apos;t wanna have anything to do with it .
rufus , are you saying you &apos;d like a divorce ?
&apos;cause where exactly
are you gonna find some other upper east side woman
to take care of you the way i have ?
spoken like a true rhodes .
you just made my decision for us to spend some time apart
that much easier .
so ... thank you .
oh , hey . how was your day ?
i &apos;ve decided to delete certain disturbing images
of my mother &apos;s past from my mind ...
and attempt a relationship with her .
well , before you two start bonding
and having spa weekends together ,
maybe you should see this .
elizabeth fisher e @-@ mailed me that picture a few minutes ago .
take a look at the date in the corner .
it &apos;s right before you were born .
but diana said elizabeth couldn &apos;t get pregnant .
well , i guess she lied to you .
jack probably put her up to it .
jack ? what does he have to do with this ?
turns out he &apos;s the one funding diana .
he could have paid her to tell you whatever you wanted to hear .
and had her pretend elizabeth &apos;s donated blood was really hers .
but if elizabeth really is my mother ,
then why would she deny being the donor ?
something still doesn &apos;t add up .
you were right .
the problem wasn &apos;t your success .
it was me .
somehow between being traded for a hotel
and selling out for a tiara ,
i lost my true self .
but i wanna be found .
could you possibly help ?
i have a feeling that the real blair waldorf
is a lot closer than you think .
wasn &apos;t all that long ago that she and i
were working side @-@ by @-@ side at &quot; w , &quot;
and i totally fell for her .
and what was that girl like ?
that girl is , uh , fiercely strong ,
independent , outspoken , beautiful ,
capable of anything , and no man or magazine
should be able to take that away from her .
she sounds great .
i look forward to meeting her again .
i can &apos;t believe lily did this to me .
neither can i ,
but you have to stop thinking about your sister
and start doing what &apos;s best for our daughter .
with you under arrest ,
it &apos;s going to be very difficult
for you to access your money .
if you sign over power of attorney to me ,
i give you my word that i &apos;ll take care of lola ,
and i will get you the best damn lawyers
your mother &apos;s inheritance can buy .
you really care about her , don &apos;t you ?
i just wanna do the right thing .
you did the right thing .
carol never should have put you in this position .
i want you to know i &apos;m not like her .
i might have ... come to new york
because carol paid me to , but once i met you ,
the only thing that mattered to me
was feeling like i was a part of your family .
so you &apos;ve said , but there is , um ,
nothing to be done about that , is there ?
i could tear up this check .
lily , please .
just let me earn back a place in your heart .
good @-@ bye , ivy .
hello ?
i did what you asked .
i &apos;ll sign carol &apos;s half of the estate over to you
when i get to the apartment .
thank you .
we both know she does not deserve that money ,
and your getting it away from her
is the least you could do after what i found out
about you two today .
but you are going to take care of lola , right ?
that was our deal .
what kind of a monster do you think i am ?
you think just because she &apos;s a product
of your extramarital affair that i would punish lola .
i wouldn &apos;t do that .
why don &apos;t i believe you ?
see you soon .
on second thought ...
take me to j.f.k.
what do you want ?
i know we &apos;ve had our ups and downs .
well , mostly downs .
but ... we &apos;re sisters now .
half . what &apos;s your point ?
i don &apos;t know a ton about being a sibling ,
but i have a hunch that uniting against parents
is a pretty major bonding experience .
i was thinking the best way for you to get back at your mom
is by helping me get my mom out of jail .
you never really stood a chance of exposing me as gossip girl ,
and i &apos;m not really interested in being your sister
all of a sudden .
so please just stay away from me and my family ,
okay , sis ?
i &apos;ll show you out now .
you okay ?
the only thing that diana and elizabeth
have in common is my uncle jack .
take a look at this photo again .
you see the tattoo on the guy &apos;s arm ?
yeah . so ?
so i know that tattoo .
check it out .
the man in that photo is not my dad .
it &apos;s jack .
what if all this subterfuge over my mother &apos;s identity
was actually disguising the real question ?
it &apos;s not who &apos;s my mom . it &apos;s who &apos;s my dad .
