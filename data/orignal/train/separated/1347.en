Oh, look at that.
Aw, come on! It'll be fun!
No. It's freezing.
Great!
Look, nobody else is out here. It's just you and me.
All right, look, I'm getting in.
Seriously.
Go!
Just give me one good reason why you won't.
Um...it's cold.
Okay.
It's dirty.
Yeah.
I don't want to.
Is that it? That's so boring.
Now, that I like.
That was unexpected. I like it. That's good.
Come on! Whoo!
Whoa, that's cold! Whoo!
Come on! Yeah, the water's fine!
Cathy! Come on! Take a picture!
The water's fine!
Cathy? Cathy?
Oh, my god!
Cathy, what is it?
What is it? What's going on?
What's going on? Hey! What's going on?
Look!
You need a theme.
I've got a theme.
What?
Booze.
People can drink at home. You need to...amp up the fun.
Yeah, like, great music can do that.
Yeah, get a jukebox.
I got a jukebox in the back. It's busted, though.
I'm gonna get it fixed.
It's got every tune ever done by Tiffany on it.
That explains why it's busted.
You need a theme.
For a jukebox?
Yeah, Maura's right.
And -- and you know what? You should switch it up.
Like, one week, do '80s hair bands.
And the next week, do southern rock.
You know, I think a little consistency would be better.
Like, all Josh Groban all the time.
I like it. That way, the bar would be consistently empty.
We would always have seats.
The bar will be full. I'm working on live music.
And you will always have seats.
Detective Kors-- um, uh...
Dirty Robber. This is Vince.
Angela, what do you think the place needs?
Yeah, ma, you're unusually quiet.
I'm thinking.
Paging Dr. Isles.
No, this is a job for two, Dr. Rizzoli.
What's up, mom?
Nothing.
Résumés? This about the job hunt?
Job hunt. How is it going?
It's not.
Nobody wants to hire a woman of a certain age.
They want to hire a 22-year-old.
Well, statistically speaking, that's not true.
Although some jobs do require more youthful employees,
I think if you just expand your universe to just --
Really? Statistics now?
There's comfort in numbers.
Not for me.
Résumés sent out -- 37.
Job interviews -- one.
Jobs gotten -- zippo.
Rizzoli.
Isles.
Korsak.
Hey, I got to call you back.
Yeah. We'll be right there.
Thank you.
I'm sorry. Ma.
Yeah, okay, forget it.
We'll talk about it later?
Okay, go. Go solve crimes.
I'm staying here.
Hey, Vince.
Gonna stay and hang some of your posters, okay?
Oh, that's very nice of you, Angela. Thanks.
Yeah, I'm very generous.
I'm also eating for free.
Excuse me. I'm looking for Mr. Korsak.
I'm here about the job.
Oh, you'll just have to leave your résumés.
We're gonna have to reschedule. I'm sorry.
You got any experience?
Not really. I'm just 22.
You'll be fine.
Well, this is a first.
I've seen it once.
Is there anything that you haven't seen once before?
You cutting me slack.
Come on, tell us.
Oh, guy fell off a sailboat. Probably drunk.
Probably urinating.
When a man stands up to urinate, his center of gravity is high
but the lifeline to the sailboat deck is low,
so without a hand to steady himself --
Got it. Y-- back to your guy.
Yeah, drunk, fell off a boat,
died of a heart attack in the water.
Both feet washed up in a couple of days.
Never found the rest of him.
So...his feet were detachable?
Well, everyone's are -- kind of.
The tendons connecting the foot to the leg are thin,
so they dissolve and break away in the seawater.
Another reason I hate the ocean.
What are the other reasons?
It's full of drunk guys peeing in it --
I think that's enough.
Well, the buoyancy of the running shoe
caused the detachable foot to rise to the surface.
The current would wash it right to this beach.
So there could be a body on its way.
Yep. Got guys in the harbor searching.
They may find it first.
Maura, can you even tell us anything from just a foot?
I'll be able to tell how the foot was separated.
Big fish could do that. - You've seen that -- once.
I didn't say once.
And once I examine the bones,
I'll be able to check for damage from the impact of a jump.
Yeah, we'll have Nina check surveillance cameras on bridges.
Yeah, we'll also check missing persons,
see if somebody went out for a jog and didn't come back.
Call us if you find anything.
All right.
Detective Rizzoli.
Tell us about the serial murderer
dumping body parts into Boston harbor.
Who tipped them off?
Looks like they got the same call we did.
What do you got, doc?
Well, based on the condition of the tissue,
the foot was in the water for less than 24 hours.
What about impact damage?
None. This wasn't a jumper. It was sawed off.
Looks like somebody's doing a thorough body disposal.
Anything else?
Well, the sneaker is a specialty brand
used by serious runners -- it has a zero drop.
Wait, wait, wait. You're losing me.
A zero-millimeter differential in height from heel to toe,
which provides a wider range of motion,
strengthening the foot, forcing it to work harder.
Forcing it to work harder?
I'll never buy these.
What's that?
Uh, the wear pattern.
There's more of it on the outside. Supination.
The user rolled along the outside of the foot.
Maybe you can give a description of the shoe
to other precincts.
So if we find other shoes,
we can compare the wear patterns.
Yeah.
Well, we've gone over all the accident reports.
So far, no people -- or feet --
have been reported missing.
I'll keep looking here.
I'll keep looking everywhere else.
Are we playing video operation?
These are body parts that have washed up on beaches
in the northeast over the last 10 years.
Uh, Jane doesn't like the ocean.
Well, that's not why, but I'll add it to the list.
I like the ocean, but don't get me started on lakes.
Why? Lakes are great.
There's no current.
Have you ever seen what settles on the bottom?
Great. Now you've ruined lakes.
Nina, is there any connection
between these body parts and our foot?
Not yet. But take a look at this.
Since 2007, 11 different feet have washed up in Canada
on the shores of British Colombia.
No one knows why.
So they don't have anything. Eh, we don't have anything.
We've got a little more than that --
another body part washed up.
A foot?
A torso.
You're gonna need more screens.
Thanks, Mr. Pompilio.
Uh, can you get his contact information?
Anything from the fisherman?
Yeah, he's a local.
Comes down once a month. Casts off the pier.
And he saw the torso wash up,
but he didn't see where it came from.
It's illegal to cast off the pier.
He caught us a torso. Maybe we'll let it slide.
Similar saw markings to the ones on the foot.
Can you tell if it's the same saw?
No, the blade markings won't be that specific,
But this is a rough cut made with a ripping blade.
Definitely a murder.
Yeah, we just... don't know why or of who.
Detectives, is this the work of a serial killer?
We're just opening the investigation.
Somebody tipped them off again?
We know one thing's for sure.
Come on.
We got a leak in the department.
That's what posters are for.
I need your Jane Hancock.
Whoa. I don't actually work here.
I don't love you, Louis.
I don't, do not, love-o, no-o.
Goodbye, Louis.
Okay, I'll sign.
Louis?
Yeah.
Well, he's a little obsessive.
That's what makes him so good at his job.
He never misses a detail. His bosses love him.
Do you love him?
Of course I love him. He's fantastic.
He wants us to move in together.
Son of a bitch.
And you don't want to?
No.
Because you're worried he'll... find out who you really are
and see all your flaws?
Yeah.
Don't you think he's a little afraid, too?
Louis? No. Mnh-mnh, no. He's perfect.
Louis is a man?
Yeah, well, then he's not perfect.
No!
What's your problem, Louis? Back off.
She doesn't want to talk to you right now.
Angela.
Yeah, well, don't call back until...
Margaret.
...till margaret calls you.
How did he take it?
Yeah, not so good.
He was still talking.
I know!
He never listens.
Yeah, well, I bet you he listens when he gets his way.
Perfectly.
How is he with the laundry?
"Que es laundry?"
Yes! Remember these?
Yeah. The thing. Volkswagen made them.
You could take the top off, take the doors off,
Make it different shapes.
Ah, so cool.
I'll tell you what's uncool -- it's in my spot.
All right.
Oh, it belongs to Chip.
The forensic artist?
Well, if he gets assigned parking,
I need to call the union.
I would so hate to be Chip right now.
Oh, yeah, he's gonna get an earful.
Yeah, you should tell Chip
to watch where he parks his thing or he's gonna lose it.
No, the car. It's a -- n-never mind.
So, is someone dumping the pieces
one at a time in the harbor
to throw us off time of death,
or is this some sort of statement?
Well, it could be that the parts were dumped at the same time
and the current is deciding when they wash up.
What do you think about the psychology of a murderer
who cuts people up with a saw?
Well, it could speak to efficiency.
Mm. Or he was very good in shop class.
This is Dr. Isles.
I have finished my external examination.
I'm making a "Y" incision on the torso.
Cutting people up like this, it's --
it's such an odd combination
between passionate and ruthless.
It's, oh, just...
Not you, the murderer.
What?
Do you smell that?
That wasn't me.
Almonds.
Oh. Yeah.
Get out. Now.
I told you it wasn't me!
Jane, it's cyanide. It smells like almonds.
When do we get our clothes back?
Exposure was brief,
so decontamination shouldn't take too long.
Jane?
What?
It's just a tickle.
Let me see.
What? Stop!
Jane, cyanide poisoning
stops the cells of the body from being able to use oxygen.
That didn't happen, and that thing hurts my eyes,
as it has the last four times that you've used it.
Here.
Keep hydrating.
It'll help keep your lungs clear.
I'll breathe better when we catch "Edward Sawhands."
Susie ran a tissue sample today,
and the results just came back.
It confirms that cyanide was the cause of death.
And the time of death was 24 to 30 hours ago.
What about the blade marks?
It was the same type of blade on both body parts.
It's a crosscutting blade, commonly found on a sawzall.
Which you can get in any hardware store anywhere.
And Susie's gonna test for cyanide in the foot.
Okay, I'll have Nina check for large purchases of cyanide.
And in a few hours, the tide comes in.
Coming through.
Do you mind if I get some more...
Hello?
Hi. Excuse me. Do you mind if get another cup of c--
Okay, so my new superpower is invisibility.
Okay. What?
No, no. I-I-I realize that.
No, look, Carlo, I'm gonna get Karen a big-ass diamond.
That's a given. I'm talking about the proposal, okay?
I want you to film it for me.
Can I help you?
Tell me, what's the plan?
What?
To propose to your girlfriend? What's the plan?
Uh, I-I don't know. It's just some lady.
I-I'm on the phone.
Hang up. This is important.
Why should I?
Because you're gonna blow this engagement,
no one is ever gonna love you, you'll die alone.
I'll call you back.
All right. Tell me.
Okay, well, I-I was thinking that I wouldn't say a word
but I would deliver the ring
in this weird, like, rube goldberg-type device
with all my bros.
Uh, no, no, I-it'll be great. It'll be like the ok go video.
Okay... no.
Drink this.
But I have to go back to work.
They can sell widgets without you.
I need to talk to you about women.
'cause you got a lot to learn.
What's up?
Oh. You got your clothes back.
Yeah, I mean, the scrubs were comfortable.
But every time I got in an elevator,
someone wanted to tell me about their rash or their headache.
And what would you say?
"Drink some water. Get some sleep."
You're an excellent doctor.
Thank you.
Mm. What's this?
A titanium rod from the torso.
Murder weapon?
Support for a crumpled spine. We'll get to that.
Now, there was cyanide in the torso, but not in the foot.
So the poison killed him too quickly,
and it got to his heart before his extremities.
Excellent supposition.
Thank you.
But incorrect.
Backsies.
There are no backsies.
Well, I had my fingers crossed.
Okay.
There were traces of blood in the foot, "O" Positive,
but the blood in the torso was "A."
So the parts are from different people.
We've got two victims.
New paperweight? Thanks.
It's a titanium rod.
Maura extracted it from the torso's spinal column.
The victim had degenerative spine disease.
There's a serial number on it.
Which Nina traced.
It was implanted in a Richard O'Connell
6 years ago when he was 19.
Local guy?
Yeah. Mom and dad are on their way in.
Do they know?
No.
Nina found the leak.
I don't believe it.
I got to take care of this.
Go. I'll talk to the victim's parents.
Thanks.
Hi.
Did I disturb your journey to another universe?
Actually, it's a heightened version of our universe.
I call it Bostonia. See? There's faneuil hall.
It's a working spacecraft, which I --
I didn't come here for the comics, Chip.
Oh. Is this about the parking?
I talked with the angry-bear guy, Korsak.
You've been leaking information to the press
about active murder investigations,
which could compromise those investigations.
I haven't leaked anything.
You sent e-mails from your work computer.
Oh, right. Yes, I did.
I mentioned some things to my cousin.
He has a local crime blog. He put the word out.
That's leaking.
No, it's just talking about work stuff with a blood relative.
This is your defense?
Yeah. So, we good?
No.
And you are so screwed.
The angry-bear guy accepted my apology.
That was parking. This is leaking.
He was an amazing athlete.
He was a swimmer, broke all the high-school records.
But his back was -- was hurting.
The coach told us that it was the long season,
so Richie rested.
He took advil by the handful,
stretched, slept on a heating pad.
Nothing helped.
It was a horrible summer.
After the first workout of the new season,
we took him to a specialist at mass general.
He had a serious condition.
Spondylolisthesis.
It's a... a rare spine disease.
It's very painful, and there's no cure.
Must have been very difficult for him.
That's what's amazing --
He handled the diagnosis with such... dignity.
He did everything the doctor asked.
And then he had surgery.
The titanium rod in his back?
It helped his, uh, posture, but not the pain.
He never complained, but it got to him.
We wanted him to have a second surgery but...
He didn't want to?
He stopped listening when he found this --
this healer.
Another doctor?
He called himself a doctor, but he didn't use medicine.
What did he use?
I don't know.
Richard got crazy when we asked questions.
He stopped taking his medication...
And stopped doing the exercises.
And he got worse. Much worse.
But he said that we didn't understand, that we...
we didn't have faith.
He thought he would get better?
He was sure of it.
Mr. O'Connell, what was the doctor's name?
Murray. Mark Murray.
Only Dr. Murray understood.
Only Dr. Murray could get him well.
When was the last time you had contact with your son?
He hadn't returned our calls for a month.
So, Richard O'Connell gets worse,
but that only makes him believe in this Dr. Murray more?
Faith is a powerful thing.
So is reality.
What did his surgeon say?
Well, the titanium rod stabilized his spine,
but he still had a progressive disease.
Which would never go away. Mnh-mnh.
Well, Dr. Murray promised a cure, gave him hope.
False hope.
Well, desperate people take what they can get.
Dr. Murray's license had been suspended by the a.M.A.
Hmm, can't wait to meet him.
Yeah, I got a bunch of fake problems
he could pretend to help me with.
How long's Murray been renting this place?
Uh, a little over a year and a half.
Heck of a place for a doctor's office.
Ooh. Well, whoever was manning the desk left in a hurry.
And they took all the people magazines.
Check with the phone company.
See when the last phone call was placed.
There's something you have to see.
Come on around. Take a look.
Just when I thought I couldn't be less of a fan of this guy...
At what point do you think Richard O'Connell
lost faith in his treatment?
When he realized his doctor was a psychopath.
If he realized.
I talked to the other tenants.
This place is classy.
We got a guy who buys your grandma's gold jewelry
and melts it down,
we have an earwax-removal specialist
who uses turkish candles,
and we have a woman who rescues cats.
Is that right upstairs?
'cause I heard some awful noises.
Yeah.
Uh, and apparently, she rescues them to keep them.
Do they know Dr. Murray?
No. He kept odd hours and used the entrance out back.
It's a perfect place to practice imaginary medicine.
Oh, come on.
This is Dr. Mark Murray.
Prepare yourself
to experience the healing properties of sound.
One man's wall of sound
is another man's medical equipment. Ugh!
Now I need medical help.
Hey, what's this?
"Tumors, facial." "Tumors, lymphatic."
"Joint pain, mild."
He's got a playlist for everything.
I don't want to hear what went along with that.
Detectives, we found dr. Murray's appointment book.
He had a patient coming in -- Russ Pfeiffer.
Mr. Pfeiffer, how long were you seeing dr. Murray?
Today was my first appointment.
So you didn't know him?
No. He was going to treat my rheumatoid arthritis.
Is he okay?
He was gonna treat you how?
By using sound waves
to create new pathways through my neural system.
Mr. Pfeiffer, traditional medicine --
My traditional doctor practiced traditional medicine.
He gave me pills -- anti-inflammatories --
for years, until my liver started breaking down.
Then pain pills, which worked -- too well.
I lived in fear of becoming addicted to them.
Constant pain or fear of addiction--
those were my choices.
How did you hear about Dr. Murray?
I was on the way home from the pharmacy with all of my prescriptions
When I saw this man putting up fliers on the bus bench
that said "Miraculous healing."
You can smile. You don't need a miracle, do you?
Uh, Mr. Pfeiffer, I-I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to offend you.
I was skeptical, too.
I asked a lot of questions.
The man said he was Dr. Murray's assistant,
and he told me such amazing stories of recovery.
He himself was cured of cancer by Dr. Murray's sound waves.
He looked at the big bag of pill bottles I was carrying
and told me he used to have a bag twice the size
And if I saw Dr. Murray,
I...wouldn't need any pills ever.
And what was his assistant's name?
That's the damndest thing.
I never got his name.
He didn't give you a card or anything?
He referred to himself as Dr. Murray's assistant.
I never heard him use his own name.
Thank you, Mr. Pfeiffer. You've been very helpful.
I can go?
Yeah.
No, let me do it.
Mr. Pfeiffer,
give us a call if you remember anything else.
We need to find that assistant.
Yeah. That's the miracle we need.
Uh, excuse me.
I'm looking for my waitress from this afternoon.
I didn't get her name.
Was there a problem?
No. She was awesome.
Uh...I-I brought Clint in to meet her--
not, like, for dating.
Uh, I'm about to be engaged. He's pre-engaged.
Well, pre-pre-engaged.
Hmm. This waitress just gave me some really great advice.
And I need a dose-- a big one.
Yeah, I thought I was clueless.
Well, you are, but I'm--
Was it Terry?
Uh...nope.
Evelyn? Short red hair?
I think she was the bartender.
I mean, she was back there when she told me
I had no idea how to propose to my girlfriend.
And I have even less.
He really does.
Uh, she had dark hair, gravely voice,
pushy, kind of inappropriate.
You're talking about Angela.
Okay.
Well, she's not here.
But I'm the owner. I know a lot about proposals.
Um...okay.
Seriously. I've been married three times.
We should go.
Yeah. It's-- it's getting late, so...
Thank you.
Thank you.
He should talk to Angela.
Definitely.
Blood from both the foot and the torso
were present at the crime scene.
Which doesn't mean they were murdered there.
Uh, no, but they were definitely cut up there.
Jane. We got to go.
Dr. Murray was kicked out of the A.M.A.,
But Nina found a bogus license he filed with the city
when he rented his office.
It lists information on the assistant.
His name is Bob Burke.
Well, let's go talk to him.
That's why we got to hurry.
An emergency call for Bob Burke just came in.
And the paramedics are already on their way.
I heard a noise, so I came out on the porch.
I saw Mr. Burke stumbling out of his apartment.
He fell to his knees, vomited, and passed out.
That's when I called 911.
You did the right thing.
I'm Detective Jane Rizzoli.
Um, can I ask him a few questions?
As long as I can keep working on him.
Absolutely.
Uh, M-Mr. Burke,
I need to ask you a couple questions about Dr. Murray.
Y-you worked for him?
I idolized him.
He was a visionary.
He was also your doctor?
He saved my life.
But... t-then he...
Then what?
M-M-Mr. Burke, please tell me.
He began to believe that he was above men...
like a God.
What's wrong with him?
We're working on that.
Almonds.
What?
He's been poisoned by cyanide.
Everybody get back!
Dr. Isles.
Dr. Rizzoli.
Dr. Rizzoli.
He's actually a nurse.
That's--
Why do you have to be that way?
She's the one who's disinfecting our clothes.
Oh, go talk to your smiley girlfriend.
Maybe she's got a thing for nurses.
Yeah, and tell her that she can solve all of her problems
by drinking lots of water and getting tons of sleep.
No, he can't say that. He's not a doctor.
I want my clothes back.
Tomorrow.
You good?
I'm good.
I'm saving a ton on dry-cleaning so...
Your clothes are in the back of my trunk.
What about Frankie's?
Yep.
Thanks for bringing them.
Oh, I guess she likes a man in uniform.
Oh, wait.
Seriously, you do need to flush out your system.
With alcohol.
Exactly. Excuse me.
May we get some service for the doctor, please?
We got a surgery in an hour.
He's weak, but when he wakes up, he could talk.
Thank you, doctor.
Hey.
Hi.
Uh, detective Jane Rizzoli.
I remember.
Thank you.
Um Mr. Burke...
Bob.
Okay, Bob, um...
Can you tell me about Dr. Murray?
He used sound waves to push my cancer into remission.
My oncologist didn't believe it,
but the tests showed it was gone.
I quit my job as an accountant to work for Dr. Murray.
You were his assistant.
I did everything.
I answered phones, handled billing.
Um, did you help with the treatments?
He put patients in specific acoustical environments
that he designed himself.
Uh, I adjusted the levels during the procedure.
And what were the results?
I saw miracles --
Arthritis just...gone,
scoliosis straightened.
Tumors disappeared.
But...then...
What? Then what?
I was an accountant, so I knew spreadsheets.
I catalogued Dr. Murray's treatment protocol.
Dr. Murray was obsessed with data.
He wanted to prove to the medical community
that they were wrong,
that he had the answer to curing all disease...
with sound.
I know. I know.
It seems crazy, but that's what I saw happening.
Everyone got better.
But then someone didn't.
Two patients didn't respond at all...
And Dr. Murray went a little...crazy.
How crazy?
He killed them.
So the world wouldn't know he failed,
and when I wouldn't help him cover up the murders,
he came to my apartment and held me down...
...and poured a vial of cyanide down my throat!
I'm sorry, but you're gonna have to leave.
He's gonna come back.
I'm the only one who knows! He's gonna come back!
No, you're safe here, okay? I promise.
I promise.
No shots! I will not have any shots!
Hey, Frankie.
Hey, Jane. I found a home address for Dr. Murray.
Okay, great. Um, text me the address.
I'll be there as soon as I can get a guard on this door.
I don't expect there'll be any permanent damage
from the cyanide.
Uh, Mr. Burke experienced a significant amount of vomiting,
which limited the amount of poison in his system.
Well, I'd like to see the results of his tox screen
so I can compare it to what I found in the two victims.
I'd love to help, but I can't.
I could get a search warrant.
We didn't do a tox screen.
That's standard procedure.
It is, but Mr. Burke
is vehemently against western medicine --
No needles, no tests.
And since he was conscious when admitted,
we had to ask for his consent, which was denied.
Then there's no way to determine his toxicity levels.
Is he aware of how dangerous cyanide is?
Oh, he's aware.
Oh, and against my advice,
Mr. Burke's demanding his release.
Susie. Grab a collection kit.
Hey, Korsak.
YO.
Look at this.
Nice boat.
Yeah, perfect for dumping body parts in the harbor.
But who's doing the dumping?
Oh, boy.
Yeah.
Dr. Isles.
Hi. It's me.
Can you send me a photo
of the wear pattern on the bottom of the running shoe
that washed up in the harbor?
Yep.
Send it to Korsak's phone.
Uh, the sneaker showed pronounced supination
in the wear pattern.
Right, and the outside edges were worn down.
Yes, it was a specialty running shoe made by Altra.
Wear patterns match.
Yep. Same manufacturer. It's also zero drop.
Um, I'm gonna have CSRU come in here
and bag the shoes and dust the apartment.
Wait, Jane. There's something else.
Bob Burke wouldn't allow the hospital to run any blood tests,
so I sent Susie over to his apartment,
and she managed to get some samples
off the welcome mat where he vomited.
Okay.
There was no trace of cyanide.
It had to come out, or he'd be dead.
No, no, no, he -- he reeked of it.
I smelled it. The paramedic smelled it.
No, he reeked of almonds
because his discharge was laced with almond extract.
He probably swallowed enough to make himself throw up.
And to make us think he'd been poisoned.
All right. Thanks.
Burke played us.
Yep.
We can't let him leave the hospital.
Harrington's guarding Burke.
That's Dr. Murray at the bottom of the harbor.
Harrington's not answering.
Frankie.
Get everybody to the hospital. Bob Burke's our killer.
Excuse me.
He looked so sick.
I didn't think he had enough strength to overpower me.
Okay. You all right?
I'm pissed!
Yeah, me too.
Jane.
Burke's gone.
He's got Harrington's uniform.
Lock down the hospital. We're on our way.
No one leaves without my authorization.
Riley. Brown. Come on.
Detective Rizzoli, how long will this take?
As long as it takes to make sure everyone's safe
and to bring Burke into custody.
Now, we have to lock down the entire hospital
floor by floor.
As my men arrive, they'll replace hospital security, okay?
I promise we'll get it done as quickly as possible.
Come on.
So, I need you at the back exit near the loading dock.
Detective Rizzoli ordered me to sweep the parking lot.
Yeah, we're almost there. What's the word?
First two floors are clear.
Okay, don't forget to check the janitor's closets.
And the air vents.
And the air vents.
He's not going anywhere.
That's him. That's him.
Freeze. Boston Police.
Hands in the air now.
You know what's in here?
Almond extract. Goes great with cookies.
You sure about that?
Absolutely.
I love a good almond cookie.
Stop.
I'm gonna get in the car now.
Don't come any closer!
Don't. Don't.
That better be almond extract.
It is. Come on.
I wouldn't carry cyanide in my pocket.
Put your hands on the wheel.
You're under arrest for the murder of Dr. Mark murray
and Richard O'connell.
Got him.
Bob was obsessed with Dr. Murray
and the idea that he found some miracle cure.
And I went through Burke's charts.
The cures that they were experiencing were temporary.
So they felt better
because they believed they were getting better.
Exactly. The placebo effect.
But eventually, the illnesses reasserted themselves.
After a year's worth of data,
he knew the experiment had failed.
He wanted to close up shop.
Bob wouldn't let him.
Well, why did he kill the other guy?
Richard O'connell realized
he wasn't getting better with sound.
He filed a complaint with the attorney general's office.
They opened an investigation.
It's just all so sad.
But I got to tell you,
sometimes faith is the only way we get through things.
Yeah, but, ma, it can't be the only thing.
No. That's why I have you.
Excuse me.
Excuse me, Mr. Korsak,
Is this a good time to talk about the bartending job?
I am so sorry, but that position has been filled.
Okay.
That's who didn't get the job?
Whoever got hired must be spectacular.
Yeah, she could be the future Mrs. Rizzoli.
I would be okay with that.
Actually, she is the current Mrs. Rizzoli,
and she's supposed to be on duty.
I already punched in.
Okay, I need a priest and a shrink right about now.
That would be me, Frankie!
Okay, bartender,
Can I get a shot for my brother, please?
Make it a double, on me.
On the house -- everyone.
Ma! Can I get a tequila, three limes, on ice?
I'm gonna go with a beer chaser with that.
Okay, okay, one at a time!
Detective Rizzoli?
Oh, good. It's Chip.
I've been looking for you.
You got me fired.
No, Chip, you got you fired.
Take credit where credit is due.
Thank you. Thank you.
You're welcome.
I needed a kick out the door,
and she gave it to me.
Yeah, she's good like that.
I hated being a forensic artist.
It was standing in the way of my dream.
Besides, who wants to be around death all the time?
Well, sometimes you...
It's not that bad.
I understand, Chip.
After you were so mean to me, I --
I wasn't mean.
Who wants to lose a tongue?
You made me realize
there was something missing in Bostonia.
I added a vigilante fighting for truth and justice,
with no regard for the rules.
And now it's gonna be published.
Look for it in your local comic shops.
So...
this is for you.
Oh, my God.
It looks a lot like you.
That's a lot of, lot of cleavage.
All right. Let me see that.
Nope. No. Can't look at that.
We'll need to keep this out of prisons.
Yeah.
Korsak.
Hey, a quarter's a quarter.
I like it.
Really?
Oh, come on. Don't be mean.
You're gonna have a lot of fans.
