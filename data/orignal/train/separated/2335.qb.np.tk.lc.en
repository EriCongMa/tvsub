for over a century , i have lived in secret ,
until now . i know the risk ,
and i have to know her .
elena , she &apos;s a dead ringer for katherine .
where is he ?
they have him . i can &apos;t get in .
pearl says we &apos;re not here for revenge , right ?
that &apos;s exactly what we &apos;re here for .
can you make it ?
take my wrist . you need more blood .
stefan , he &apos;s dead .
you were like this other person .
everything &apos;s gonna be ok .
they found vicki donovan .
a storm unearthed the grave off county road .
she &apos;s dead ?
matt .
could you turn it up a little bit ?
it &apos;s not annoying yet .
sorry .
when you goin &apos; back to school ?
soon .
oh , come on . just drink already .
come on .
this self @-@ detox is unnatural .
could you get that away from me , please ?
how long did it take you to wean yourself off of it
after you last indulged ?
that &apos;s not good .
be fine . it just takes a little bit of time .
i don &apos;t get it . you know ,
you don &apos;t have to kill to survive .
that &apos;s what blood banks are for .
i haven &apos;t hunted a human in ...
gahh ... way too long .
oh , i &apos;m impressed .
it was completely self @-@ serving .
trying to get the town off the trail of vampires ,
which is not very easy ,
considering there &apos;s an entire tomb of them running around .
what are we planning on doing about that ?
we &apos;re not gonna be doing much of anything
if you don &apos;t have your strength .
there &apos;s nothing wrong with partaking
in a healty diet of human blood from a blood bank .
you &apos;re not actually killing anyone .
i have my reasons .
well , what are those holier @-@ than @-@ thou reasons ?
you know , we &apos;ve never actually discussed that .
you know , i @-@ i &apos;d love to hear this story .
you &apos;re really enjoying this , aren &apos;t you ,
just watching me in a struggle ?
very much so .
i hate to break it to you , damon ,
but ... ahem ... i actually have it under complete control .
you do ?
oh . well , then you should just carry on
making the rest of us vampires look bad .
have a great day , stef .
oh . hey , i almost forgot something .
come on , jeremy . going to school .
walking out the door now .
you forgot this .
thank you .
elena .
uncle john . hi .
jenna .
john . you made it .
said i &apos;d be in by noon .
oh , what you say and what you do
are typically two very different things .
uncle john . what &apos;s up ?
i had some business in town .
i thought a visit was in order .
how long you staying ?
i don &apos;t know yet .
hmm . ok . well , i &apos;m gonna go to school . i &apos;ll see you later .
what &apos;s up with jeremy ?
he just lost a friend ,
so try to be sensitive .
i &apos;m always sensitive .
right . so really , how long are you staying ?
can &apos;t you at least pretend that you &apos;re happy to see me ?
oh , my god , john .
it is so good to see you .
how have you been ?
no , i can &apos;t .
did you really think i was just gonna sign
the escrow papers and send &apos; em back ?
actually , i did .
i &apos;m not gonna let you sell my brother &apos;s office .
it &apos;s not up to you or me .
it belongs to jeremy and elena .
they &apos;re minors , so i get the final say ,
being that i &apos;m the estate &apos;s trustee .
he said his trip is open @-@ ended .
uncle john . i never really liked that guy .
heh . does anyone ?
i am here for moral support if you need me .
thanks . i think i &apos;ll suffer this one alone .
you &apos;ve been through enough .
thank you , by the way , for just ... for everything you did
at vicki &apos;s funeral and her memorial .
i couldn &apos;t have done it without you .
of course , matt .
so is caroline still baking for you guys around the clock ?
she finally went to her dad &apos;s , which is a good thing
because my mom was gonna strangle her
if she dropped off more lasagna .
what &apos;s your problem ?
i just don &apos;t want any .
all right .
they say she oded .
that &apos;s what i don &apos;t get . she was doing ok .
apparently not .
how &apos;d she end up buried in the woods ?
that &apos;s what i don &apos;t understand .
by whomever was with her when she oded .
yeah , but you leave her there .
you don &apos;t take the time to bury her .
maybe she saw something and ...
hell , man , i don &apos;t know .
the coroner &apos;s office has officially ruled
vicki donovan &apos;s death a drug overdose .
her family has been notified .
the truth will stay in this room ,
and we can put this behind us .
thank you , sheriff .
and on to a more pressing issue .
john gilbert has asked to say a few words .
welcome back , john . it &apos;s good to see you .
thank you , mayor .
hello , everyone . it &apos;s wonderful to see you .
i wish it were under better circumstances .
as a founding family member ,
i find it &apos;s d duty to report some very distressing news .
he &apos;s a gilbert ?
elena &apos;s uncle .
his name &apos;s john , but i call him jackass .
a hospital blood bank in the neighboring county of amherst
has reported several breakins over the past two weeks .
7 hunters , 4 campers , and 2 state employees
have been reported missing as well ,
all of this within a 75 @-@ mile radius of mystic falls .
ok . no need to get alarmed right at this moment .
meaning he doesn &apos;t wanna cancel the founder &apos;s day kick @-@ off party .
you think all of your problems are over ,
but i &apos;m here to tell you nothing &apos;s been solved .
i made a copy of a paper that jeremy wrote for me .
i think you should take a look at it .
jeremy wrote this ?
he &apos;s very clear that he didn &apos;t think it was real .
i really hope you &apos;re right ,
because i &apos;ve done so much to protect him from all this .
so how do you deal with it ?
what do you mean ?
i don &apos;t know . with all the lies and the secrets .
you have to lie to everyone who &apos;s important to you .
it &apos;s not safe for them to know the truth ,
so , yes , i keep it from them ,
but it &apos;s only because i love them .
i think stefan &apos;s a good guy ,
but , uh ...
at the end of the day , he &apos;s still a vampire .
i know it &apos;s hard to understand ,
but stefan &apos;s different .
he would never do anything to hurt me .
i have no interest in the founder &apos;s day kick @-@ off party .
sure , you do . it &apos;s tradition .
far be it for us to break from tradition .
the gilberts have been a part of this town for 150 years ,
one of the founding families ,
and with that distinction comes certain obligations ,
including going to the party .
one day , when you can appreciate the significance ,
i &apos;ll tell you all about your heritage .
hmm . the gilbert family legacy .
i forgot how sacred it was .
i &apos;m not a gilbert , so i was never cool enough to hear it .
why does she hate you ?
we used to sleep together .
i &apos;m standing right here .
why would he write a report on vampires ?
do you think he &apos;s starting to remember ?
damon took away those memories for good .
you don &apos;t have to worry about that .
tell you what . why don &apos;t you just ask him ?
i ... i can &apos;t .
why not ? i mean , if he doesn &apos;t know anything ,
then it &apos;s just a ... an innocent question .
i don &apos;t even know how to talk to him anymore .
i mean , we used to be a lot more open with each other ,
but now , with all these secrets just piling up ...
you know , i haven &apos;t even told him
that i &apos;m adopted yet .
maybe it &apos;s time you start opening up to him again .
i &apos;m not saying you should tell him everything ,
but at least try to find
out what he does know and be prepared for it .
what about you ? how are you doing ?
i &apos;m much , much better .
yeah , i &apos;m ... i &apos;m still , you know , a little , uh ...
a little jittery ,
a little bit on edge , but , uh ...
i &apos;m ... i &apos;m gonna be ok .
i &apos;ve been really worried about you ,
and i missed you .
i just needed to lay low for a little while ,
and , uh , let my body readjust .
it &apos;s only been a few days .
it feels like a lifetime .
i &apos;ve missed you , too .
stefan , what &apos;s wrong ?
stefan .
oh , good . you &apos;re here .
you ask , i come .
i &apos;m easy like that .
no , elena , i will not ...
go to your bedroom with you .
just like i remembered .
stop messing around .
you know , did you know
that your uncle &apos;s been kickin &apos; it with the founder &apos;s council ?
what ?
yep .
perfect . we &apos;ll just add it to the growing list
of how everything &apos;s falling apart .
what happened right there ?
uh , nothing .
look , damon ,
i ... i &apos;m worried about stefan .
he says that everything &apos;s ok ,
but he &apos;s clearly struggling .
how long is it gonna take before he &apos;s back to normal ?
few days , give or take .
it &apos;s been a few days .
give then . i don &apos;t know .
what &apos;s the big deal ?
he &apos;s not himself , damon .
well , maybe his problem is he &apos;s spent too long not being himself .
please don &apos;t make me sorry for aking you .
it is what it is , elena .
hey .
the stefan you know
was &quot; good behavior &quot; stefan , &quot; reign it in &quot; stefan ,
&quot; fight against his nature
to an annoyingly obsessive level &quot; stefan ,
but if you think there &apos;s not another part to this ,
then you have not been paying attention .
he &apos;s not you , not even close .
well , he doesn &apos;t wanna be me .
but that doesn &apos;t mean deep down that he &apos;s not .
what &apos;s up ?
do you have some time to talk ?
uh , yeah , sure .
not here .
come on . let &apos;s get out of the house .
i just can &apos;t believe mom
and dad never told you that you were adopted .
i &apos;m sure they would have eventually .
why were you worried about what i thought ?
because ... i don &apos;t know . it &apos;s weird ...
going your whole life
thinking you &apos;re related by blood to someone .
does it bug you that we &apos;re not ?
no . jer ...
you &apos;re my brother . that &apos;s all that matters .
so mr. saltzman said you &apos;ve been doing great in history now .
yeah . yeah , he &apos;s really been helpin &apos; me out .
he gave me some extra credit and stuff .
he loved your vampire paper .
yeah , he thought i had a clever angle .
what drew you to that subject matter ?
uh , i don &apos;t know . um , boredom .
or maybe i &apos;m just as nuts as the long line of gilbert crazies .
the gilberts aren &apos;t crazy .
ah , easy for you to say . you &apos;re not one .
ouch .
oh , god .
i shouldn &apos;t be here .
come on . don &apos;t be a downer .
it &apos;s a party for the founding families .
that would be us . it would be rude to skip it .
you know , i ... i really liked you
a whole lot better when you hated everybody .
oh , i still do .
i just love that they love me .
how you feelin &apos; ?
i &apos;m good . i &apos;m fine .
no cravings ? no urges ?
has that whiskey you been drinkin &apos; all day doin &apos; its job ?
we are who we are , stefan .
pretending doesn &apos;t change that .
ah , nothing would make you happier
than to just see me give in , huh , damon ?
whatever . it &apos;s inevitable .
i &apos;m gonna go find elena .
don &apos;t embarrass me , young man .
i &apos;m so glad you could join us tonight .
it was nice of you to reach out to us .
this town is one big family ,
and when we lose a member ,
we all have to come together .
matt . kel .
well , i guess dead kid
rates a special greeting from the mayor , huh ?
god , mom .
i need a drink .
hey , check it out .
dude , your dad &apos;s gonna beat you down if he catches you .
yeah , let him try .
all right , screw it .
hey . how are you ?
are you drunk ?
ok , i know it &apos;s a little weird ,
but it &apos;s really helping me .
the alcohol , it , uh ...
takes the edge off .
you &apos;re totally that drunk high school guy
at the party sneaking booze .
i totally am . yeah .
how worried do i need to be ?
oh , no . you don &apos;t need to be worried .
it &apos;s just until , um , the cravings go away .
listen . i think we should enjoy it while it lasts .
would you like to dance with me ?
you hate dancing .
i usually have to beg you .
no , no , no . you have to beg the sober me .
the drunk me , there &apos;s no begging necessary .
there &apos;s really no one dancing .
that &apos;s because they need something better to dance to .
be right back .
yeah , that &apos;s not gonna work .
i already tried to bribe the guy with 20 bucks and a date .
he said carol lockwood
has complete control over the music choices .
you &apos;d be surprised what stefan can accomplish
when he puts his mind to it .
thank god .
have i entered an alternate universe where stefan is fun ?
is he gonna be ok ?
eventually .
one way or another .
history teacher , 3 o &apos;clock .
how do i look ?
beautiful .
ah , i &apos;ve been lookin &apos; for you .
here i am .
i haven &apos;t seen you in a while .
yeah . well , uh ,
things have been a little crazy . heh .
but i &apos;m here now .
do you wanna get a drink ?
sure .
ok . great .
when did this happen ?
deejay had a change of heart .
wanna dance ?
i don &apos;t know .
yes . yes .
matt . matt .
come on .
ah , you know i love a woman in uniform ,
but i have to side with this look .
you look ... you look smashing .
heh . thank you , damon .
cheers .
i needed that .
you know , i had my doubts about you at first
but like everyone else on the council ,
you &apos;ve won me over .
heh . thanks , liz .
it &apos;s ... it &apos;s really nice how welcoming the council &apos;s been .
i like my life here in mystic falls .
starting to feel like home again .
well , then you &apos;re not gonna like what i have to tell you .
jonathan gilbert &apos;s claims check out .
the blood banks , the missing people , all of it &apos;s true .
we might have a problem .
excuse me , sheriff .
um , i was curious if there &apos;s been
any more information on what happened to vicki donovan .
it was an overdose , jeremy .
yeah , but her body was buried .
somebody must have done that .
we &apos;re aware of that .
the investigation is ongoing ,
but there &apos;s nothing more i can tell you at this time .
i &apos;m sorry .
uh , that &apos;s ok .
please dance with your alcoholic vampire boyfriend .
watch it .
i &apos;m sorry . my fault . i &apos;m clumsy .
heh . then get off the dance floor .
excuse me ?
that &apos;s no way to talk to a lady .
whatever .
i think you need to apologize .
i &apos;m sorry .
now say it like you mean it .
i &apos;m really , really sorry .
stefan , it &apos;s fine .
now walk away .
are you all right ?
have you noticed what your brother &apos;s been up to ?
nope . been too preoccupied with yours .
jeremy &apos;s been asking questions
about vicki dodovavas death .
he knows that her death was ruled an overdose .
really ? &quot; oh , but , sheriff ,
someone buried her .
who would do that ? &quot;
i know . i know . me .
i mean , i could compel him ,
but he &apos;s wearing vervain .
no . i don &apos;t want you to compel him .
if he keeps asking questions ...
damon , no . i &apos;m serious .
i &apos;m not gonna do that to him again . i &apos;ll handle it .
ok .
don &apos;t say i didn &apos;t warn you .
i saw that .
we &apos;ll keep that between you and me .
where &apos;s the ladies &apos; room ?
this way . i &apos;ll show you .
is that soda ?
vodka . thank god .
damon , right ?
john .
we didn &apos;t get a chance to meet at the council meeting .
yeah . it &apos;s ... it &apos;s a pleasure .
are you enjoying the , uh , kick @-@ off ?
oh , yeah . forgot how much fun
these small @-@ town celebrations can be .
yeah . yeah .
when &apos;s the last time you were here ?
hasn &apos;t been that long . my brother &apos;s funeral .
how long have you been in town ?
well , not long at all .
so what do you think , damon ?
you know this vampire problem is real , right ?
it &apos;s a potential blood bath .
i wouldn &apos;t overreact , john .
oh , i think it &apos;s like 1864 all over again ,
vampires running amok .
guess we &apos;re just gonna have to hunt them down ,
throw &apos; em in a church , and burn them to ash .
that is the story , huh ?
part of the story , yeah .
oh , there &apos;s , uh ... there &apos;s more ?
oh , there &apos;s a lot more .
you see , seems there was a tomb under the church
where the vampires were hidden away ,
waiting for someone to come along and set them free .
but then you already knew that , didn &apos;t you ?
being that you &apos;re the one that did it .
and you &apos;re telling me this , why ?
i just thought we &apos;d get the introductions out of the way .
well , you know that i could rip your throat out
before anyone would notice .
yeah .
yeah . ok .
but you probably ingest vervain , so ...
why don &apos;t you take a bite , find out ?
it &apos;s not worth my time .
jer .
i , um ... i heard about your conversation with sheriff forbes .
no one is trying to figure out what happened to her .
they &apos;re willing to believe that she oded .
the coroner &apos;s office confirmed it .
if that &apos;s what they said happened , then ...
is that what you believe ?
what do you think happened ?
i think somebody killed her and buried her body ,
and i don &apos;t think we should write it off just &apos; cause it &apos;s easy .
they &apos;re just doing what they can to move on .
the truth is the only thing that &apos;s gonna help people move on .
jer , just ... just let it go . ok ?
whatever it was , she &apos;s gone now .
whatever it was ?
so you don &apos;t think it was an overdose .
yes . i ... i do .
is there something you &apos;re not telling me ?
why aren &apos;t you looking at me ?
stop it . that doesn &apos;t mean anything .
if there was something else , you would tell me , right ?
of course i would .
oh , god . i ca ... i can &apos;t even walk .
i know . me neither .
oh , god . matt &apos;s gonna kill me .
ah , he won &apos;t even notice .
i think he &apos;s actually letting himself have some fun for once .
yeah , well ... well , i know i &apos;m supposed to be
on my best behavior because of vicki ,
but i don &apos;t wanna think about it .
i can &apos;t , &apos; cause if i do ...
yeap , i was a dick to her .
i was really bad .
that &apos;s what i hate
is i can &apos;t make any of it right .
it &apos;s like i don &apos;t deserve to even miss her .
you &apos;re nice to talk to me .
i don &apos;t have anyone to talk to .
i don &apos;t have anyone to talk to either .
who knew i &apos;d be missing all the fun at the founder &apos;s parties ?
this is rare , believe me .
is it bad that i &apos;m , uh , enjoying myself ?
no . it &apos;s great that you &apos;re enjoying yourself .
thanks for making me dance .
hey , not a problem .
air . ah heh .
air . i need some air .
um , come with me ?
sure .
you havet seen my mom , have you ?
um , no . not in a while .
all right .
oh , my god .
what the hell are you doin &apos; , man ? !
matt ...
mom !
whoa . dude , calm down .
matt ! no !
stop it !
tyler !
tyler ! stop it ! you are hurting him
somebody &apos;s help us .
stop ! tyler ! hey !
what the hell was that ?
here , matt , get up . are you ok ?
what the hell was that ?
i &apos;ll take it from here . i &apos;ll take it from here .
it &apos;s all right . it &apos;s ok .
you hurt ?
go get cleaned up . it &apos;s ok .
go get cleaned up .
thank you for your help .
everything &apos;s fine . everything &apos;s fine , everybody .
come on . everybody back to the party . let &apos;s go .
come on . have a good time .
are you ok ? where is she ?
i don &apos;t know .
come on . put your head up .
do you wanna hear the bad news or the really bad news ?
hmm . actuay i don &apos;t want any news , damon .
all right , let me rephrase .
do you wanna hear
how the council &apos;s back in vampire mode
or how i just killed uncle john gilbert ?
what ?
great party by the way , huh ?
damon .
is everything all right ?
no .
i ... i ruined it .
i always ruin it .
what is wrong with me ?
what are you doing ?
i &apos;m sorry .
you &apos;ve gotta be kidding me .
thank you all .
thank you very much . thank you .
thank you all for joining us tonight .
in just a few moments , we will officially begin the countdown
to our upcoming founder &apos;s day celebration ,
and it &apos;s a very special one this year ,
the 150th birthday of our town .
and ... and i would like to welcome back
one of our town &apos;s favorite sons
to do the honors of ringing our official charter bell .
john gilbert , would you please join me up here ?
150 years of community , prosperity , family .
we take care of each other ,
look after each other ,
protect each other .
it &apos;s good to be home .
look at his right hand .
whose ?
the town &apos;s favorite son . look at his ring .
oh . that looks like mine .
yeah , and that would be a big coincidence
if he didn &apos;t just come back from the dead 5 minutes ago .
where the hell did you get that ring ?
isobel , my wife .
who gave birth to elena
under the medical care of the esteemed
dr. grayson gilbert , john &apos;s brother .
oh . you think john knew isobel ?
i think john knows a lot of things .
take care .
have a good night .
sorry about that , man .
no , really , i &apos;m terribly sorry .
you don &apos;t wanna do this , man .
sorry about that , too .
god , all i can do is apologize .
what &apos;s that about ?
get out of my way , please .
no girl to show off for now ?
i see how this is . heh .
wh @-@ what are you , man ?
stefan .
stefan .
hey . hey , are you okey ?
what happened ?
my arm .
i lost my balance and fell .
i &apos;m clumsy .
let &apos;s go .
dad , i &apos;m sorry .
i don &apos;t even know what happened .
i was drinking , and ...
i lost control .
can &apos;t explain it ..
that is the last time you ever embarrass this family .
what are you doing ?
matt , don &apos;t .
i can &apos;t do it anymore , mom , so just go , all right ?
you &apos;ve done it before and more times than i can count .
i &apos;m not leaving you .
matty .
mom !
don &apos;t you get it ?
i &apos;m better off without you .
no .
tonight was a ...
god , i &apos;m so sorry .
i know i failed you , and i failed vicki ,
but i won &apos;t do it to you again .
i promise i &apos;ll get it together .
i want you out of the house ...
and my life by morning .
matty .
goin &apos; somewhere ? hmm ?
never like to be the last one to leave a party .
it &apos;s too desperate .
you here to kill me again ?
or you gonna let mr. saltzman do your dirty work ?
ok , you obviously know who i am .
i do . alaric saltzman ,
a highchool history teacher with a secret .
sure know a lot for someone who just got to town .
more than you can imagine , damon .
my knowledge of this town goes beyond anything that you
or you or the council knows .
so if you were planning on some clever high @-@ speed ,
snatch @-@ ring , vamp kill move ,
know that if i die
everything i know goes to the council ,
including the fascinating little tale
of the original salvatore brothers ,
and their present @-@ day return to mystic falls .
how &apos;d you get the ring ?
i inherited one ,
my brother gray , the other . this was his .
and i wouldn &apos;t have given mine to isobel
had i known she &apos;d hand it over to another guy .
so you did know her .
who do you think sent her your way
when she wanted to become a vampire ?
you sent her ?
guilty .
why , did you think someone else sent her ?
maybe katherine pierce ?
how do you know about katherine ?
how do i know anything , damon ?
what do you want ?
so many questions .
it was a pleasure meeting you , rick .
i &apos;ve heard so much about you .
not so excited that we have
another month of these founder &apos;s day events .
tell me about it .
you okay ?
fine .
are you sure ?
i &apos;m fine , elena .
oh , my god . you scared me .
sorry .
i &apos;m sorry that i ... i ran off earlier .
what happened ?
is everything ok ?
no .
talk to me .
stefan , tell me .
i tried ...
so hard to keep it together tonight .
and it was working . it was working ,
uh , but ... but then matt &apos;s mom , she , uh ,
got hurt , and she was bleeding ,
and i had her ... her blood on my hands .
and then what happened ?
and then that ... that guy in the parking lot ,
i wanted to feed on him ,
and it took everything inside of me not to do it .
but you didn &apos;t ?
no , but i wanted to .
god .
elena , i ... my ...
my head is pounding ,
i feel like my ... my skin is on ... is on fire .
i have this hunger inside of me that i &apos;ve never ...
i &apos;ve never felt before in my entire life ,
and all i keep thinking about
is how i promised that
i would never keep anything from you ,
and so i &apos;m telling you this .
that &apos;s ok . i need you to tell me these things .
but i don &apos;t want you to see me like this .
i don &apos;t want you to know that this side of me exists .
stefan , you &apos;re gonna get through this .
i &apos;m gonna help you pull through .
it &apos;s gonna be ok . you &apos;re gonna be ok .
no , no , no , no . no , no , no , no , no .
no , i &apos;m sorry . i ... i can &apos;t .
i @-@ i &apos;m afraid of what i could do to you .
i &apos;m not .
stefan .
stefan , i &apos;m not .
i &apos;m not , ok ?
i love you so much .
