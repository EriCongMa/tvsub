My father was an innocent man,
destroyed by powerful people.
The Graysons are behind this,
and they're gonna pay.
I've dedicated my life to avenging his death.
Eventually, someone's gonna find you out.
And I won't stop until they've all paid the price.
You can't go in there!
I have to. Jack's inside.
Oh, god! Declan. Oh, my god.
There was a bomb at Grayson Global.
I think Conrad meant it for me.
I want to save you.
I can't just walk away,
not now. Maybe not ever.
Certainly not for me.
Where's my brother?
He's gone, Jack.
Freeze! FBI! Get on the ground.
Nolan Ross, you're under arrest.
Nothing that's gonna keep me from making Grayson
pay for what he's done.
Jack, don't do it.
Don't throw your life away because of the choices that I've made.
What are you talking about?
I'm Amanda Clarke.
Fear...
it's a fire that burns from birth
in even the coldest heart.
It motivates and paralyzes the best of us...
or is used as a weapon by the worst.
But when your path is one of treachery and deception...
the greatest fear of all...
is that the truth is absolute.
I'm sorry.
Afternoon, sunshine.
I hope this weather holds. It's beautiful.
Well, it's never rained on a Grayson memorial day kickoff.
I'm not a Grayson yet, Daniel.
Then why don't we finally set a date
to make you one?
Let's just get through tomorrow first, okay?
You know, I still can't believe
you tried to engineer a family reunion.
Too bad only half my family's gonna be there.
But aren't you the slightest bit curious
why we haven't heard from your mother these past six months?
Well, I can only hope after the way she left things with us,
that she's in such a dark, lonely place,
that we never hear from her again.
Surprised you don't get thrown.
You're light as a feather.
Oh, and you're constantly saying all the right things.
Something the matter?
I hope you understand that it's not a good idea for you
to be staying here while Conrad returns.
Here.
Hey, don't need-- you don't have to put me up.
And you didn't have to stay with me these past six months.
I'm so grateful that you did.
You know, I would have been happy to have you join me in the city.
I wasn't trying to hide you.
I just wanted to keep you all to myself.
Charlotte.
Oh, my, I wasn't expecting you for a couple of weeks.
Well, apparently, we no longer own property in Paris,
which I loved discovering at 3:00 A. M. ,
after chartering a car from Brussels.
Darling, I'm sorry nobody told you,
but the European market is very strong right now.
As is your stableboy, it seems.
I know the past few months have been very difficult for you,
losing Declan and the baby,
but I was hoping that graduating early
and going to Europe would prove restorative.
Or perhaps you're just suffering from jet lag.
Maybe you should go home and lay down your head
and have a good bite to eat.
We'll discuss it later.
That's a lot of words for "welcome home."
We still own the manor, right?
Only took ten years to return the favor.
I was kinda hoping you'd have to repay this one never.
Thanks for having them let me out of a side gate.
Wasn't ready to face my fickle public yet.
Well, I'm glad you're back among the living, Nolan.
Took a lot longer than expected
for the fail-safe I invented in Carrion
to ferret out all the initiative numbers,
exonerate me.
All that matters is that it did,
and let's never say the words
"Carrion" or "Initiative" ever again.
Amen to that.
Speaking of...
How go the rules of engagement?
I'm doing my best to avoid setting a date
while Daniel looks for a job.
And I guess I can sympathize since, well,
Nolcorp has gone the way of the flip phone.
So... what'd I miss?
Jack was about to shoot Conrad?
Yes, Nolan.
I thought it was the right move to stop him.
All right, I know, but no, just going all birth name on him.
Wait. You didn't tell him I was president of the inner circle, did you?
I haven't seen him.
After Declan's funeral,he packed up the Stowaway
and left with Carl.
I guess that's for the best.
I don't wanna risk losing one of the few friends I have left.
I'm sorry,Nolan.
You should never have been involved in my plans.
No dice,Ems.
I will be by your side until we have taken down
everyone who wronged your father...
and me.
Especially if this is your new summer pad.
Not mine.
For serious?
If memory serves,I still owe you a house.
I guess sometimes payback's not a bitch.
Although I imagine it will be
for New York's first and worst family.
What do you have on tap?
A long summer of fun.
Beginning with tomorrow's Memorial Day party?
And if everything goes as planned,
that'll be the last one the Graysons ever attend.
Revenge
One day before its debut,
and you're still missing the depth in my eyes.
Arctic pools,Laila. Arctic pools.
You know what? Uh... Give me a minute.
Thank you.
Finally achieving the immortality You've always hoped for.
Oh,no,my legacy lies in the work I'm getting done.
It's a springboard both for the state's rehabilitation
and my ascension to the higher offices to which I'm destined.
To that extent,I've been going over the specs of the party
Ms. Thorne's been kind enough to throw in your mother's dormancy,
and while security is acceptable for a typical Hamptons hobnob,
it's sorely inadequate for a future presidential candidate,
So we will be adding handheld metal detectors
and x-ray scanners at all the entrances.
Is that why you called me here?
To make me head of your security detail?
I mean,I know I need a job, But I'm not that desperate.
I didn't say you were.
This is a dossier for Rice & Hawthorne,
where a primo V. P. position awaits.
I said,dad,hedge funds aren't for me anymore,
and neither are your connections.
It's time to make something of myself.
Well,as long as it isn't kickstarting a poetry review.
Oh,that'd be my Chief of Staff,
who worked at Rice & Hawthorne,by the way.
Scotty,what's the good word?
There are much nicer places to get a drink.
Some of them are even open.
Just... Getting a little fresh air.
Miles away from your penthouse
and the venue of the party that you didn't invite me to.
I'm sorry,Ashley. I didn't know you were in town.
Knowledge is power,Emily.
I thought you had power,Ashley.
to pay me to forget about all the crap he's done.
But that well has dried up,
and since there's no upside to me barking about it,
I'm coming to you.
For what?
Everything you have.
I saw that look in your eye the night of the election.
You weren't there to save Conrad's life.
You were there to save Jack's.
And since I know how you still feel about him,
I will stop at nothing to expose you to the Graysons
for the fraud you really are.
That's not how it happened,Ashley.
And to be honest,you seem a little desperate.
I'll be at your party tomorrow,
and you can introduce me to some men of standing.
Sound like a plan?
Is that all?
No. We're just getting started.
"I want a virgin screwdriver. "
Margaux?
I mess up one order when I'm 14,
and you'll never let me live it down.
You seemed very happy with your orange juice.
Such a nice surprise to see you.
How long has it been?
Oh,well,since before you knew how to properly ask for a drink.
Light summer reading?
Yeah,I wish.
Looking for my next career move.
I've never understood how making money is a job description.
But of course,your kind are a necessary evil
as I'm here to be ogled by yet another investor.
That could be 'cause you're not wearing a bra...
Or because boys never grow up.
You didn't catch me looking,did you?
But you still noticed.
I'm actually late.
But let's catch up tomorrow at your girlfriend's Memorial Day party.
You're coming?
I try not to miss a chance to see American culture--
Elusive as it is.
All right. Well,I'll see you then.
Yes.
All right.
Uh, Margaux...
Emily's not my girlfriend. She's my fiancee.
Oh, my mistake.
I can never keep up.
Emily?
I saw the doors open. I was hoping you were home.
Oh, my gosh. Look at you. You look so different.
Thank you. I like it.
And you've obviously been in the city too long.
You're missing the most beautiful sunset.
I hope you didn't cut your trip short
just so you could make my Memorial Day Party.
No, I'm home because my lovely mother
has left me no other monetary option.
Have you seen her?
Seen her?
I almost caught lady chatterly with her lover.
Her lover?
More like boy toy, actually.
I think he's even staying at the house.
Beautiful.
Emily.
It's a shame you still feel the need to drop by unannounced.
Had you called beforehand, I would have invited you to dinner.
I had the most marvelous salad of asparagus
I picked fresh from the garden this morning.
Well, I'm sorry I missed it.
Well, I should box some for you...
along with any animosity you and I may have shown each other.
Let's allow the past to remain so, shall we?
That's actually why I'm here.
I haven't received your RSVP for tomorrow.
I'm sure you know that we're unveiling your husband's portrait,
and I worry that your absence will
send the wrong message.
Oh, well, I have little concern of what people think of me at the moment.
Well, then this probably won't matter to you either, but...
I wanted to let you know I ran into Ashley.
She told me you were having an affair.
And she's so desperate,
she thought she'd blackmail me to protect your secret.
And you came to warn me.
Well, that's very kind.
Well, suffice it to say,
that her facts are as ill-conceived as her intentions.
Oh, I don't doubt that she's wrong, Victoria.
But...
I will say that you seem happy.
Is it possible that
someone else has lifted your spirits?
Like... Patrick?
Oh, of all people, you see right through me.
Yes. He showed up the night of Conrad's election.
Though I haven't laid eyes on him since he was 6 months old,
I had no doubt that he was my firstborn.
He's changed my heart.
Well, I should head back to the city...
back to the man who changed mine.
I trust that you'll keep this information to yourself.
Then I trust I'll see you tomorrow.
I think both you and I understand the importance
of protecting the sanctity of the family.
As much as we have to deal with those who won't.
Bye.
Well, I think she's gonna love meeting you, Jorge.
Okay. All right. I'll see you then. Thanks. Bye.
I didn't hear you get in last night.
I got a late start leaving the Hamptons--
Dropped in on your mom for a goodwill call.
Yeah? And how is the witch?
She actually said she'd come today.
Really? Seems like we're all doing better apart than together.
It's been a long time, Daniel. What could go wrong?
You know, your rosy optimism
almost makes me forget my family fortune's been stolen,
and I'm unemployed.
Look,we can worry about that tomorrow.
Today, let's just relax and try to enjoy ourselves.
Not if our esteemed governor has anything to say about it.
He's amping security-- x-ray scanners, the whole line.
So make sure you're not sneaking in anything explosive.
OK.
Claims it's 'cause he's entertaining a presidential run.
Or his ego.
There's a difference?
Dad!
There's my little...
woman, it would seem.
Europe did wonders.
You would have loved it.
Why don't you tell your overworked dad your favorite moment?
That's easy.
I'd just come out of the Reina Sofia,
which was life-changing.
And I see a newsstand selling the "Herald Tribune"
with you on the cover.
And I was so proud, I turned to the stranger next to me
and said, "That's my dad."
You can't imagine what it feels like to hear that.
I'm proud of you, too, kitten,
especially after everything you've been through.
Charlotte? You didn't tell me that we had a visitor.
If it isn't south Hampton's most ravishing shut-in.
It appears monastic life suits you, Victoria.
So I imagine such anonymous contentment must seem odd
to a man who has to service... 20 million people.
Oh, you know, my constituents are clamoring for you, too, my dear.
That's a din I'm prepared to quell.
As I'm planning on coming to the unveiling today.
That's a timely change of heart.
May I presume that you'll also be representing my office in Binghamton
for the transfer station opening next week?
Mm, baby steps, Conrad.
I'll see you at the party,dad.
Yeah.
Look, I hope you can respect that I need to keep the trappings of this office
for as long as possible--
not only for the good I'm doing,
but lest you forget, it's our sole source of income.
Oh,believe me. I would love nothing more
than to see you remain at the state house.
Especially after the inexcusable things you did while living here.
Yes,all in my endeavor to keep us alive--
a debt you can now repay by going to Binghamton.
To christen a landfill? I think not.
Then you leave me with only one option.
And what's that?
As of tomorrow,Grayson Manor is on the market.
Conrad's increased security at every entrance.
And for what I'm planning for the Graysons,
let's just say,I have to bring it in with me.
Mm,so much for nesting.
I need you to hack this x-ray machine.
Cyber-revenging has brought me nothing but trouble.
So for now,I'm done with coding,camming,
programming,and hacking.
I'm Nolan two point... no.
But... there may be a way.
How?
Trust me.
I always trust you, don't I?
I've got more unpacking to do.
Fine.
And I'm not the only one unpacking.
Jack's back.
I hope you don't mind if I let myself in.
My family is paying for this suite, after all.
What are you doing here?
Exactly what I was going to ask you.
Though I guess I know what you were doing at my house.
Charlotte,you don't understand.
And when I tell my father about you,
he'll squash you like a bug.
Your father knows I exist.
Who the hell do you think you are?
I'm your brother.
What?
Patrick. I'm your brother.
Well,I guess it's typical.
Daniel and I go away for a couple of months,
And my mother buys our replacement.
And I'm sorry you have such a low opinion of your mother.
She's been nothing but gracious,generous,kind.
Well,if you think you're just gonna
enjoy the perks without the misery,
you're wrong.
My mother will draw you in and destroy you.
It's what she does.
And if she doesn't, I will.
Charlotte.
Jack?
You want a drink?
No, thanks.
I want a drink.
I'm glad you're back.
Where you been?
I was introducing my son to his extended family.
How is Carl?
He's good.
I am so sorry that I lied to you--
that I didn't tell you the truth in the first place.
I...
I know.
Well, I think about all the opportunities you had to tell me,
that night under the fireworks,
the night Sammy died.
I wanted to.
But you didn't.
So I ask myself why--
Why was this so important to you?
Then a couple weeks ago, I...
I was leaving my uncle's place in Pittsburgh,
and Carl was asleep in the back.
I looked in the rearview, and...
Just as he was waking up, his eyes caught mine.
And...
He just sprang to life.
And in that moment, I saw...
the love that a child has for their father.
And I understood...
Why you're doing what you're doing.
And why you told me when you did--
to save me.
I didn't know how I felt about you till this moment.
And I'm sorry.
I just don't feel anything.
I'll keep your secret...
But it's just me and Carl now.
Leave us alone.
Oh, you know, it was so strange coming downstairs this morning
and not seeing you at breakfast.
And obviously, you felt the same
since you asked me to pop by.
And I could use a happy moment.
You look--well, you look incredible.
Oh, it's just something I threw together
for Emily's party this afternoon.
What's this?
That's actually-- that's why I called.
Um, I can only consider myself a freelancer
if I actually paint on occasion.
So, um, I'm going back home to the city.
So you're leaving me?
Or was that your plan all along?
Drawing me in,
then abandon me as payback for my transgressions?
No.
I don't even know what kind of person would do that. I--
Then what happened?
Did someone say something?
It's just time.
Time for both of us.
And, um...
I'll be in touch. I promise.
Bye.
Can you believe it's been two years since we met?
Gosh, it feels like so much longer.
Can I get you something?
Uh, just water would be great.
All right. I'll see you in a bit.
Thanks.
No, no, no!
Don't tell me you've stopped drinking now.
Oh, come on. You know me better than that.
It's for Emily.
Your fiancee, right?
Ashley.
Welcome. That's a bold move--
taking this tradition from the sea to the land.
Well, people feel less like prisoners
when they have the option to leave.
Trust me, I'm staying.
Dr. Velez.
You must be Ashley.
Jorge Velez.
Charmed.
We met at an alzheimer's benefit.
I thought you two might hit it off.
Oh, um, if you'll excuse me.
Sure.
I'm so happy you could all make it.
Emily.
Thank you for picking up the mantle
and launching the season off in style.
I hope you say a few words after my dedication today.
Oh, I, uh, you know,
I may have prepared a little something.
And you, too, Victoria?
Oh, I don't want to take the spotlight
on what's essentially your coming out party.
Well, after a 6-month absence,
I daresay it's also yours, my dear.
Yeah, they'd all love to hear what you've been up to.
Trust me, I have very little of interest to say.
It doesn't look like Ashley has that problem.
I'm going to go look for Daniel.
Governor Grayson.
Oh. Good to see you.
Great to see you.
Daniel... your family arrived.
Huh, I didn't think you could pull it off,
but the gang's all here.
Em, I'd like for you to meet Margaux Lemarchal.
Oh, Pascal Lemarchal's daughter. Enchantee.
I'm a huge fan of all of his publications--
Especially "Voulez."
Oh, that's why I've moved here--
to start the american version.
A new magazine in the digital age?
Even with a strong brand behind it,
it's not an easy prospect.
Which is why I'm doing it against Pascal's wishes.
Sometimes it needs crossing an ocean
to get out of a father's shadow.
And what do you do?
I mean, besides throw lovely parties.
Well, I work for a lot of different charities,
Making sure people get what they deserve.
Notify security.
Excuse me.
Hold it right there. Hold it right there.
What the hell are you doing, Nolan?
I meant to, uh, R.S.V.P., but, uh...
was unceremoniously detained.
You could have been shot, Mr. Ross.
Beats waiting for a death sentence, Governor.
Keep an eye on him.
You look piqued, Conrad.
I cannot suffer any more bad press
due to that fool.
Well, let's get straight to the unveiling.
Refocus the crowd.
That's a good idea.
Today we unveil the portrait
that will serve as a remembrance
for all of the good that you've done for generations to come.
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you...
Governor Conrad Grayson.
Well, first of all, I would like to offer each and
every one of you the warmest of welcomes from this lovely location.
And from the office...
I'm -- I'm sorry.
We, uh...
Damn it, what is that? Um...
Please step back. It's okay.
The press is getting antsy.
Someone should probably make a statement.
Maybe we should wait until we have something to say.
I was concerned after your syncope
that your collapse may have been something hypoperfusive.
So I ran a full panel.
And it came back with a C.A.G. score of 48.
I'm afraid you have Huntington's disease, governor.
What is that?
It's a neurological disease where one slowly starts
to lose motor skills and mental acuity.
It's progressive.
And it's fatal?
No.
Uh, you need to get tested, son. It's genetic.
How... rapid is the onset?
Depends on the patient.
You have a high-stress job, governor.
Nonsense.
My grandfather worked until retirement with this disease.
You need to consider your options.
Say nothing, Conrad,
until we know what to do.
Not even to your staff.
Daniel... brief the press.
My father will be fine.
He's suffering from severe dehydration,
but he'll be back on his feet in 24 hours,
So that's all I got to say.
Sorry, ma'am--
no, he knows me.
Yeah, she's good.
Okay, go ahead.
I do hope your father will be okay.
Ah, our fathers are nothing if not survivors.
I can see your worry.
But a colleague in paris has Huntington's,
and he's doing well, so I know Conrad can fight this.
How -- how do you know what my dad has?
Um, well, I received a news alert as I walked up...
quoting a source close to the family,
which I assumed was you.
Excuse me. I'm sorry.
Oh, Victoria.
Patrick's left me.
Conrad's dying, and now... Daniel may have it.
You know, all was good for a while.
Now it's being torn away,
and I just have to sit here and take it.
Well, sometimes forces beyond our control
can change everything.
We'll get through this...
together.
Dad's diagnosis is out there.
What?
Apparently someone "close to the family" went to the press.
I hate to say it,
but with Conrad's condition being public knowledge...
he has to step down.
I'm gonna go talk to him.
Who knew besides us?
Only Dr. Velez.
But I can't believe that
he would destroy his career over this.
Unless he was a little too candid
with someone he's interested in.
And since Ashley wants money,
I'm sure she netted a handsome payday
by selling her story to the press.
You're responsible
for what happened to Conrad today, aren't you?
He had no right being governor in the first place.
So you almost kill him?
Isn't that exactly what you were stopping me from doing?
I'm not killing anybody, jack,
but I will let them suffer.
These are terrible people doing terrible things.
This is what they deserve.
Did Amanda get what she deserved?
Did Declan?
Will I, once the Graysons start connecting dots?
'cause they know what Amanda Clarke
was trying to do to them.
They just killed the wrong girl.
Yeah, you're right.
Finish this by the end of the summer,
then leave for good.
Or I'll tell everyone the truth.
Ashley.
I thought Conrad asked for me.
Well, one of your many misconceptions, Miss Davenport.
Emily told me about your pathetic attempt to blackmail her
and your vendetta against our family.
I thought you might like to explain it yourself.
Well, Emily obviously didn't tell you the full story,
like the fact that Jack Porter
tried to assassinate your husband
the night he got elected.
And who do you think gave him the gun?
Well, I also know that Conrad planted that bomb
at Grayson Global and led Jack there to die.
With a text message sent from your phone.
I hope you didn't use your phone this time
to sell Conrad's story to the media.
I did no such thing.
What you've done is try to sleep your way to the top
after failing at a myriad of jobs
we gave you out of pity.
Well, at least I tried to work for it
as opposed to having everything handed to me.
That's funny. It seems as though you want me
to hand everything to you.
Conrad's last act in office
was to requisition your cell records.
That prove, in fact,
that you attempted to lure Jack to his death.
Get on that plane. Go back to Croydon.
We'll bury the information.
Sound like a plan?
You two are evil.
What we are, like it or not, is family.
I've been reading about this disease.
Paranoia. Facial tremors.
Loss of judgment.
Memory.
My dad's in for some... seriously rough waters
until, uh...
Until he...
Then let's get married
before the end of the summer.
For my dad's sake.
Yeah.
That means a lot.
You got a date in mind?
How about August 8th?
I know it sounds silly, but ever since I was a kid,
I... always imagined something wonderful
would happen on that day.
And now something will.
I'm gonna go for a swim to clear my head,
but let your family know.
At least something good happened today.
What are you doing?
Waiting for your father to come home.
I still can't believe it.
So are you gonna put dad in Patrick's room?
Assuming your son will keep staying at the South Fork.
It really was such a lovely way to meet my brother.
I hope I didn't scare him off.
How dare you, coming back here as if you run things?
You have no idea what you've done.
Since you're obviously much happier with your other children,
I'm moving out.
Fine.
婚礼打算在8月8日举行
Given the turn of events,
I assume you'll keep my house off the market.
Don't worry, Victoria.
Neither of us is going anywhere.
And here...
is to buying me a house...
Just down the beach from you.
Away from the prying eyes of Victoria on her cupola,
where I could never do this.
So... Ashley's been... daven-deported?
Guess that's what happens when you get two takedowns for the price of one.
Which I couldn't have done without you.
What happens next?
Jack came to see me.
Gave me an ultimatum.
Well, that's heavy.
What are you gonna do?
Have the wedding of the century.
Take down Victoria once and for all.
When's the big date?
August 8th.
A fitting end...
to a path of revenge.
Fear is the most primal of emotions.
It can linger as a memory
burned into one's mind of a parent taken too soon.
Or burrow into one's soul as self-doubt
over a child's rejection.
But the one thing we all fear the most...
is the unknown.
Patrick.
What are you doing here?
Same thing as you.
Looking to destroy the girl next door.
