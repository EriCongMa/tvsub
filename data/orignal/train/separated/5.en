第五季第十三集
You crossed the line.
I am not going back.
There are lines.
And then there are lines.
Do you know what needs doing?
I'll tell you what needs doing.
You make your own lines.
What's going on?
He shot the other guy.
Now they're blaming the bald guy.
Now she's in trouble.
I got it.
Hello.
Hello.
Is your mother home?
Uh, Mom?
Oh, it's by the door!
Tell him the piping on the jacket is leather!
Uh, the piping on the jacket's leather.
When do you want it back?
When do you want it back?
Thursday.
Good.
And could you also tell her, uh, Charles Lester is here?
Uh, Charles Lester is here.
What?
Grace, go to your room for a minute.
I'll be right there.
Why? Who is that?
Grace, please.
Uh, Zach, go to your room for a minute.
I'm working in the kitchen.
Bring your work in your room.
Nice to meet you, Zach.
You, too.
Nice boy.
So, now, did you want starch with any of these?
Ha-ha. What are you doing here, Mr. Lester, at my home?
Oh, we have a problem.
Then call me.
No. This is not something for the telephone.
May I, uh...
Can we do this tomorrow?
I'm sorry, no.
Wow, what a beautiful apartment.
You know, I have no eye at all, but this is beautiful.
Thank you. What's the problem?
I have it right here.
Just tell me.
No, no. I-I have it written down.
I probably should get a smart phone.
My wife says that's the only way to... Mm.
Uh, the bond hearing is at 10:30 tomorrow morning.
Uh, Mr. Bishop is at the, um,
Pike Street station. Is that a "P"?
Lake Street station.
Oh.
Drug arrest?
Why do you ask that?
Why do I ask if it's a drug arrest?
Because it's Lemond Bishop.
Well, he has legitimate businesses also.
Is this about his legitimate business?
Not really.
Then what are we talking about?
Mr. Bishop had nothing to do with these murders,
said family spokesman and lawyer
Charles Lester.
Maybe it's a different Charles Lester.
He's just the spokesman.
It's not like he actually did it.
"An ex-Bishop captain,
who spoke off the record, said,
Stay out of Charles Lester's way and whatever you do,
don't give him your name."
I read your investigative report, Marilyn.
All two pages of it.
I told you, Eli,
I could only report on what I could clearly confirm.
You're hurting Peter with these games.
This is not a game, Eli. You stonewalled me.
I can't write a report...
Peter needs you to clear him.
Jim Moody acted alone. That's what you heard.
Peter never saw this tape until you showed it to him.
We'd like to see an amended report by tomorrow night.
This is not just...
Hello, Ms. Garbanza.
I'm Nelson Dubeck with the Office of Public Integrity.
Would you mind joining us for a second?
Did you see who's...
Yep.
They still represent Bishop's legitimate businesses.
We can't get away from them. We see them more now.
We have to stop sharing clients.
All rise.
Uh-oh.
What?
Judge Kluger. I have a lunch with him.
Okay, we have a...
probable cause hearing.
Mr. Bishop, we've seen you in here before.
Your Honor.
And Mrs. Florrick and Mr. Gardner,
Ms. Lockhart...
and, um...
Mr. Agos.
Mr. Agos. I'm sorry.
We have a full cast of characters. Like a clown car.
And, you, sir,
uh, you're a new lawyer here?
Charles Lester, Your Honor.
You step in if one of them dies?
Let's hope that won't happen.
No, I'm just, uh,
Mr. Bishop's personal attorney.
And the federal government.
You have no one to hold hands with over there, Mr. Asher?
I hold hands with justice, Your Honor.
I see. How does justice feel about that?
It was a joke, Your Honor.
Oh, a joke. I see.
Well, I'm gonna have to watch out for you, you wag.
Let's dig in. What do you got?
Uh, Your Honor, it'll only take a few minutes
to establish probable cause in this case,
as the evidence is overwhelming.
Really? Mrs. Florrick.
Your Honor, according to the DEA's own search warrant,
it stemmed from a single eyewitness.
And I imagine you'd like to hear from that witness.
We definitely would, Your Honor.
You have to jump on it. They want to impress Bishop,
win back all his business.
Ms. Moretti, what were you doing at 4:10
in the afternoon on February 26?
I was in a condominium unit
across from the Bruckman Building.
The Bruckman Building is a residence owned by the defendant, right?
Yes. I sold it to him.
And what did you see from the window?
Well, I was getting ready to show another unit
when I saw three African-American individuals
getting out of a black SUV.
Was the defendant among them?
He was. He was standing watch in the alley
while the other two were carrying duffle bags into the back entrance.
I saw one of the bags zipped open,
and there were white packets inside.
Like bricks.
How far away was she?
Cary's questioning.
And these bricks,
did they look like drugs to you?
Objection. Calls for a conclusion.
It sure does. I will sustain that.
Howard Lyman, please. It's Will.
Are you comfortable?
Reasonably.
You scared me to death.
Sorry. The black van tends to intimidate.
We need your help, Ms. Garbanzo.
Ms. Garbanza.
My apologies.
We're looking into your boss, ma'am.
You mean Eli Gold?
No.
Why?
Voter fraud.
I can't help you.
Yes, you can.
Y-You'll think you can't
because of your loyalty to Peter...
You mean Governor Florrick.
But you'll soon realize you're vulnerable.
Do you want to know why?
No.
You have no attorney-client privilege.
Everybody else is a lawyer. The world is full of lawyers.
You're the type that goes to jail.
For what?
Conspiracy to defraud the public.
Please open the door.
But there's another reason you'll talk to me, Marilyn.
I said open the door. Let me out.
It's the right thing to do.
What are you doing?
Why?
What's the matter?
Well, he's not the, um...
brightest.
Mr. Lyman, as a Lockhart/Gardner lawyer,
were you assigned a task on Mr. Bishop's case?
Yes.
And could you tell us what that was?
I could.
What was it?
I was to assess the property
that Mr. Bishop was gonna purchase.
And were you assessing properties
on February 26 at 4:00 P.M.?
Yes. And a lot of other dates.
But on that date, were you assessing
a property at 1677 South Oakley Avenue?
Yes.
And is that anywhere near the Bruckman Building
where Ms. Moretti claims she saw Lemond Bishop
unloading white bricks?
No, it's, like, 20 miles away.
And who showed you these condos on South Oakley?
Ms. Moretti.
Your Honor, the only proof is this man's opinion?
Actually, if I may continue, your Honor.
Please.
Now, Mr. Lyman, did you happen to take photos
of the condo at South Oakley?
Panoramic photos.
And is this one of your photos?
Yes, it is.
And who is that there in the corner?
That's Ms. Moretti.
We submit the camera and the stamped photos
as evidence, Your Honor.
Okay.
AUSA Asher, do you and justice have anything to offer?
I'm sorry, Your Honor. Uh, this is Agent Cheswick.
He's not from Justice. He's a DEA agent.
I'm referring to your holding hands with justice.
I'm-I'm sorry, Your Honor?
Do you guys joke much over there at Justice?
All the time.
Good. Your friend from DEA,
does he have anything to offer?
Your Honor, I think I can clear up a confusion here.
I was just rushing over here after interviewing Ms. Moretti.
And she apologizes,
but she made a mistake.
She saw the defendant transporting drugs
a day earlier, on February 25.
Have a seat.
You were just rushing over here?
You don't seem very out of breath.
I'm a good runner.
Are you? Okay, here's what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna free
Mr. Bishop.
Your Honor, that's completely unacceptable.
...walk away? Wait, guys, this isn't Crossfire.
I'm gonna free Mr. Bishop on $100,000 bond.
I'm not dismissing the charges.
We're gonna go to trial. But I'm gonna
tell you something, guys: you can't do this.
You tell a story, and you stick to it.
I have a lunch with Judge Kluger tomorrow.
I didn't know he was on this case.
I thought you said this lunch was just about a book
he's writing about lawyers.
It is, but I...
It doesn't feel...
I think I should cancel.
What?
You don't want to piss off a judge,
not one we're arguing in front of.
Mrs. Florrick, do you have a minute?
There's no way the real estate agent could've seen me
moving any product on February 25.
Because you're innocent?
No.
I was moving product on February 26.
So you're saying they got their facts right,
but the witness couldn't have seen it.
Yes, she wasn't there.
And she couldn't have seen it on February 25
because it wasn't happening.
You think they don't want to reveal the reason
they knew about the drugs?
Yes.
A confidential informant?
Didn't I tell you she was smart?
Yep, that's what we're considering.
Who?
Well,
when Mr. Bishop was here last week, um,
who was in the meeting?
No.
We've reviewed our memories, Mrs. Florrick.
We only mentioned Mr. Bishop's February 26 location once,
and that was in the meeting with your firm.
No. It had to have been someone else,
someone from your crew.
No.
Mr. Bishop kept his location private.
But he did share it with your firm in case there was trouble.
You were the only ones who knew where he was.
So...
could you give me those names?
Actually, do you mind taking the stairs
and giving us a minute?
Hi. I don't think we've met.
Uh, Charles Lester.
Clarke Hayden.
Were you in the meeting last week?
Oh, Mr. Lester, can we talk?
Definitely. And, uh, you must be Robyn, right, the bubbly one?
I don't know about that.
And what was your last name?
Uh, okay, we're gonna talk.
Excuse me.
I'll investigate.
If there was a leak...
and I very much doubt that there was... then I'm responsible.
Okay. That's good of you.
But Charles will work with you.
Mr. Bishop, this is my firm.
This is my life.
If this goes wrong, you won't be the one doing 15 in Pekin.
I thought you liked working with me, Alicia.
Did I do something wrong?
No.
Not at all, but after the meeting, did you talk to anyone?
After the Lemond Bishop meeting? No.
I mean, I did talk to people, but not about the meeting.
And did you take notes?
Yes.
Where are those?
In my desk.
I lock my desk.
I am so sorry that I'm late.
I couldn't find a cab, and I hate to drive.
Mr. Lester, we were just finishing up.
Really? Oh, darn.
Well, maybe I can just listen in on the end.
Mr. Hayden.
Hello, sir.
You were just saying that you didn't tell anyone
about the facts discussed in the Bishop meeting,
and that you didn't show anyone your notes.
Actually, I didn't say that... about the notes.
You...?
Are you sure?
Yes.
So, you showed someone your notes.
No, I locked them in my desk.
I just wanted to be exact.
I hadn't said it yet.
Good. Thank you.
So, just a few questions from me.
Did you do a cost-benefit analysis of Mr. Bishop, sir?
Of all the clients, yes. Why?
Oh, I don't know.
I'm just nosey.
Who did you share this analysis with?
Just the partners here.
No one else?
No one else.
Now, you have a friend from high school
who works for the Drug Enforcement Agency.
Howie?
Howard, yes,
and I can't find his last name.
I didn't leak anything.
Well, that stands to reason.
When was the time you saw Howie?
2002.
And what about your father?
When was the last time you saw him?
Mm, like a month ago.
He reminds me of you, actually.
A handsome devil, eh?
He wanted to be a lawyer, but
they were kind of the turn on, drop out sorts.
Did your dad have a drug arrest?
Oh, yeah, more than one.
He grew pot in our backyard for a while.
So, that's odd,
you becoming an investigator for Treasury?
Ah, I needed a job. Student loans.
And you had lunch with a friend
from Treasury just last week.
Yeah. How'd you know that?
I know everything.
But you didn't tell your friend anything about your work here?
Uh, yeah. He thinks it sounds like a real kick,
starting up like this.
No. But nothing about client meetings?
Oh, no, no.
That never leaves these walls.
It's not us, Mr. Lester.
Those are the three most honest people I know.
Well, I know a lot of honest people,
but I don't always trust them because...
they talk too much.
No, that's... that's just Robyn's way.
Trust me.
The leak is elsewhere.
Okay.
Now, I'd wanted to clear everyone
before I asked your firm to do this,
but events are moving too quickly,
so, I have to ask you to, uh,
keep this completely to yourself.
We need you to be on call
at 3:00 tomorrow.
Why?
Well, Mr. Bishop is delivering something to O'Hare.
In case of trouble, I need you on call.
This is not a good time for Mr. Bishop.
I would urge restraint.
Unfortunately, this is a delivery he can't delay.
Just be on call at 3:00.
Okay. I...
Oh, God.
What?
I have to go.
Judge Kluger, I am so sorry.
Oh, Alicia. Please. It's no problem.
How are you?
Good.
I'm, uh, so sorry.
I got tied up with a client.
Yes, I figured as much.
Tied up and gagged to keep you away from me.
Um, how's the book going?
Oh, it's good. Uh, uh, good.
Unfortunately, another judge has just called me,
and-and I'm gonna have to cut this short.
You... Oh, now?
Yes, unfortunately.
It's a... it's an emergency.
Okay, um, well, can I...
can I call and-and let me schedule another time?
That would be fine, yes.
Well, can I walk you?
Oh, no, no,
uh, because I have to start this on the phone, so, um...
Why don't you stay and have a drink?
Again, I'm so sorry.
Yes, this is Kluger.
What's going on, Cary?
I'm drinking.
Is this some kind of punishment?
No. You asked me for drinks.
I'm drinking.
Funny.
You want to get me to talk, you just say talk.
Don't play games.
Good evening, Marilyn.
Eli.
It's just the two of us today.
Peter asked me to take this meeting.
What?
He's avoiding me.
No. He has a scheduling conflict.
For our last three meetings?
It's been busy.
Maybe you haven't heard.
He's governor.
You have a great talent for turning friends into enemies.
Issue a report supporting the governor.
And I'll be back in his good graces?
No.
What is it?
A video of a stuffed ballot box.
Thank you, Marilyn.
This is the first step toward clean government.
You really never drive?
Never.
Haven't you seen the statistics on roadway deaths?
Yeah, but the same statistics apply when I'm driving.
True, but that'd be your fault, not my fault.
Sir, do you know why I stopped you?
I have no idea.
You were driving recklessly.
Crossed the median a few times.
Something funny, sir?
Yes, I find it funny.
Do you always conduct routine traffic stops
with DEA agents in tow?
Please step out of the car.
Sir, we see what appears to be cocaine
in plain view in the rear of your vehicle.
That gives us probable cause to search.
I'm now opening up the trunk of your vehicle.
Hello, Mr. Bishop.
Agent.
You want to tell me what this is?
That's, uh, pancake batter, sir.
It's more than 900 grams, that's 10 to 50 years.
For Bisquick?
Take a look at the bottom of the trunk.
Robyn, I left you three messages.
Please call me back.
Has anyone seen Robyn?
Mr. Hayden, have you seen Robyn?
Uh... there.
Robyn, where have you been?
Why aren't you answering your phone?
At lunch.
Mr. Lester said not to take any calls this afternoon.
He... Why?
Mr. Bishop was taking something
to the airport at 5:00 and might need me.
No, at 3:00.
No, at 7:00.
Mr. Bishop,
we're your lawyers.
You need to trust us, or get new representation,
but this childish test...
I was just pulled over on the way to the airport.
We told four people at your office
four different times for Mr. Bishop's delivery.
12:00 p.M. For Mr. Agos, 3:00 for you,
5:00 for Ms. Burdine, 7:00 for Mr. Hayden.
Don't you want to know when we were pulled over?
No.
3:00, Mrs. Florrick.
Your time.
Mr. Bishop, I didn't...
We told you
and only you, that I was dropping something off
at the airport at 3:00.
After you were told this, you met with Judge Kluger.
To discuss his book at lunch.
Did you tell anyone
either in person, or on the phone?
No!
Did you text
or e-mail?
No, I didn't. I...
I...
Yes?
I left myself a voice mail reminder.
Did you ever talk on the phone
about Mr. Bishop's
apartment drophouse?
Yes, with Cary Agos.
We discussed it.
Lemond, don't use the phone!
Don't worry. It's a burner.
Dex, I need you
to drop off some burners at Florrick-Agos.
We have... A problem.
The DEA is tapping them.
Drop everything else and get over there, now.
Hey, this is funny.
What?
They think it's DEA surveillance.
Burner phones again?
You've done this before?
No, when we were
leaving Lockhart/Gardner.
This is different.
How long do we have to use these?
We don't know. The DEA
is getting to Bishop through us,
so any business calls,
use these, and be careful,
the packaging can cut.
We got to go to court.
Get a preservation order.
Why? That won't help us now.
It will with the judge.
He already thinks they lied about the real estate witness.
So, we'll show they lied to protect their wiretap.
That was... almost Will-like.
Thank you, Diane.
Be careful what you say.
Hello, this is Alicia Florrick.
Wow, that was formal. It's Eli.
I want to talk to you about this voter fraud investigation.
Actually, Eli, let me call you on another line.
Another... Why?
I'd rather talk to you on another line.
Yep, she's on to us, she's switching numbers.
Who's she on with?
Eli Gold.
Right, one of mine.
We can trace it back through his line.
Oh, and, uh, I just sent you something.
This isn't one of those things where the guy jumps up
and scares you?
No, it's pets riding a roomba,
it's very cute. Watch it, it goes fast.
Damn it, I hate those.
I got her on Eli Gold's line.
Hey, Alicia, what was wrong with your work line?
Nothing, we're just having some issues.
Have Peter call me on this number
when he wants to talk, okay?
Got her burner number, I'm sending it to you.
Glad to see you two are working, finally.
What's up?
We got a problem with the Marwat warrant.
The...
The one that became the Florrick warrant.
Oh, right. Lawyer.
She's married to the governor.
Right, well,
she represents a drug dealer named Lemond Bishop.
They just realized we're listening.
They what?
They just realized that we are listening,
well, actually they think it's the DEA,
but they're still changing numbers.
How did they realize?
We don't know.
You can get around it?
The new numbers? No problem,
but we're not sure how we got exposed.
All right. Come with me.
Let's go.
It wasn't our fault.
I didn't say it was. Come on.
I've got a translation to do.
It can wait.
Okay, what do we have today?
It has come to our attention,
Your Honor, that our phones are being tapped by the DEA.
Excuse me?
Hold on, Frank.
It's come to your attention how?
The DEA attempted to execute an arrest using information
that only could have been gleaned from our calls.
Well, that's exciting.
Frank, is it true?
Is your friend tapping their calls?
Just one second, Your Honor?
Okay.
What relief are you looking for, Mr. Agos?
An order to preserve the wiretaps.
For later discovery?
Yes, Your Honor, we believe that this...
this- this real estate witness, I forgot her name...
Oh, I forgot her name. Screw her.
We believe, Your Honor,
that she lied in order to protect the real reason
for the warrant: the DEA's wiretap.
Wow. Okay, hey,
Frank, where are we?
Uh, Your Honor, uh, h- how could we possibly preserve a wiretap
when there isn't one.
Your Honor, that's a lie.
The DEA showed their hand...
To suggest that a U.S. Attorney would stand in open court
and knowingly deny the existence of a wiretap is preposterous.
Oh, he happens to be right.
If the DEA were wiretapping your phones,
they would have to say so
or they would go to jail.
The prosecution has been lying
since they stepped into this courtroom.
I'm gonna deny the preservation order
because there's nothing to preserve.
Well, then, again, we ask, Your Honor,
under these circumstances,
that this warrant based on supposed testimony be thrown out.
And the charges brought against Mr. Bishop be dismissed.
All right, I'll consider the motion,
and I will return... with my ruling.
He's ruling against us.
Here's a difficult decision.
Do we tell Lockhart/Gardner?
Tell them what?
They're being tapped.
I mean, if we are, they are.
I didn't do anything wrong.
I used it exactly the way I said I would.
You endangered an NSA warrant.
The subject knows she's being surveilled.
Look, you were encouraged to
share your intelligence with other departments.
That's what you did.
In case you didn't realize,
there's still a drug war going on in this country.
And a drug war didn't bring down the Twin Towers.
Oh, God, do you guys love pulling that out.
This has gone way beyond terrorism and you know it.
I know we can't do our job
if you keep making mistakes.
Tell him.
The target, Mrs. Florrick, is changing her numbers.
She's being more cautious.
But about us. The DEA.
Not you guys.
But I...
We're cutting you off.
Oh, you can't do that.
I just did.
No more tidbits about where Bishop is picking up his drugs.
Do your own homework.
Yeah, I would, if we were given the power you have...
The only explanation that makes sense
is that the DEA is tapping our phones.
And they're probably tapping yours, too.
But they denied it in court.
Yeah. And they lied when they put that phony witness on the stand.
Well, thank you, Cary.
We appreciate you sharing with us.
What do you think?
I think it would explain
how the DEA got their information on Bishop.
It could also be a Florrick-Agos attempt
to undercut our business.
We have to divulge to our clients.
Our clients worry about our security.
Kalinda, why don't you find out if Cary is telling the truth.
Sure.
The, uh, motion to dismiss the warrant is denied.
We are gonna go to trial. Any other motions,
cause of actions, speak now or forever hold your piece.
Your Honor, I have a request for a substitution of counsel.
You what?
AUSA Alvarez will be stepping in.
Why wasn't this done in the probable cause hearing?
Why is this being done now?
I am resigning, Your Honor.
You're recusing yourself.
No, I mean I am resigning from my position as US Attorney.
Is it something we said?
Your Honor, it's not you.
This is an interoffice matter.
What's going on?
I don't know.
Some interagency battle?
Ah, there you are.
We were just leaving.
Do I know you?
No. Not yet.
Nelson Dubeck, with the Office of Public Integrity.
And this is John, Ron, and Patrick.
Um, do we have an appointment?
No, I'm sorry, we didn't have time.
So what is this regarding?
We have a videotape we would like to show you.
You look like you've seen this before, Mrs. Florrick.
Really?
What would I look like if I hadn't seen it?
Well, in my experience, when a wife sees evidence
that her husband has stolen something, she is... surprised.
Oh, I see.
Which one's my husband?
This is serious, Mrs. Florrick.
I would take it seriously.
Mr. Dubeck,
my husband has spent every day
of the last four years being investigated.
Every single day.
Actually, I'm wrong.
There were six months when he wasn't investigated,
the six months he was in prison.
You're not inspiring confidence, Mrs. Florrick.
The only time my husband didn't do something wrong
was when he was in prison?
Did I say something amusing?
I used to be like you,
certain, deferential to authority...
Is that what I am?
...thinking everyone being investigated
is obviously guilty.
It's just a matter of time.
You should be investigated.
It changes you.
You know what's different this time, Mrs. Florrick,
from all the other times your husband has been investigated?
This time, you were his lawyer.
Yep, on election night.
This time,
you can go to prison yourself.
That's what will really change you.
Are you here to serve a subpoena?
No, not yet. Like I said,
I'm giving you a chance to get in front of this.
Thank you, but no.
I'd get my affairs in order
if I were you, Mrs. Florrick.
You've got kids to think about,
your new law firm.
Eli, where's Peter?
Where are you calling me from, China?
It's a bad connection. Where's Peter?
In a meeting. Why? What's wrong?
A man from the Office of Public Integrity just left my office.
His name is Nelson Dubeck.
He has a copy of the video you showed me.
That's impossible.
The Tribune reporter agreed to hold the story.
Eli, he showed it to me.
Nora, get Marilyn now.
I don't care what she's doing.
Okay.
Marilyn gave it to him?
I don't know, maybe.
Alicia...
I need to ask you a question.
Marilyn was under the impression
that an old friend of yours could hurt Peter.
Who?
Will.
How?
He found the video.
He's the one who told Peter the votes were fraudulent.
The Feds have nothing unless they have him.
Do you have any influence left there?
No.
You get more on that drug dealer?
Better.
Don't.
What if it's important?
Then you'll miss an important call.
Why were you giving me the silent treatment?
I can't trust you.
Why not?
Well, I can't trust you either.
That's true.
Mutually assured destruction.
Are you telling the truth about the wiretap?
That Lockhart/Gardner is being wiretapped? Yes.
What are you doing about it?
Buying burner phones.
Did you alert clients?
We talked about it.
But you haven't yet.
We're getting our house in order...
and you should, too.
Kalinda,
I'm telling the truth.
He's lying.
You're sure?
Yeah.
Will, I just talked to Kalinda.
We're okay.
Cary wants us to chase our tails?
That's what it looks like.
Wow. It's almost fun to watch.
I think Will and Diane end up getting it on.
What? You're crazy.
Listen to them.
That is not sexual attraction.
You need a life.
This is a dossier on the new AUSA, Theresa Alvarez.
Texas Tech undergrad, Northwestern Law.
She was in tax fraud before moving
to organized crime.
Where was she born?
Mm, I don't know.
Where does she live?
We don't need that.
Yes, we do.
Mr. Lester... We should look
into Asher. Find out why he resigned.
He's a law-and-order type, so...
my guess is when he heard about the wiretaps,
it didn't sit well.
A crisis of conscience?
Only one way to find out.
I am not answering that question.
Sir, if you're aware of illegal activity...
What I'm aware of is that my responsibility to this office
does not end with my departure.
But it ends if someone in the government committed a crime.
Hey, how's Tyus?
Excuse me?
Your son, Tyus.
He goes to Tisch now, right?
My nephew Akiva goes there.
He loves the place.
Yeah, Tyus is fine.
And your daughter Scarlett,
she plays on that AYSO team.
Am I right?
All right.
This is what's gonna happen, Mr. Lester.
You're gonna leave my office,
or I'm gonna call the marshal
and have you arrested...
Sir, I'm sorry.
I used to work as an investigator for Treasury,
so I get what you're going through.
Sometimes you see something that doesn't make sense,
something wrong, and you can't participate.
But it's also wrong to pretend it didn't happen.
No. But nice try using my conscience against me.
Lemond Bishop is a scumbag
who should be dropped in the deepest hole
in the U.S. Penitentiary Service.
But this isn't about him or the DEA.
The wiretap isn't?
What's it about?
If I have a confession to make,
I'll make it to my priest.
This isn't over yet.
Mr. Asher, the warrant
w... Uh, strike that.
Given that, um... Strike that.
Did you prepare the warrant
that is the subject of this probable cause hearing?
That's the one.
Objection. Work product, Your Honor.
Mr. Asher worked with the prosecution.
Yes, until he resigned two days ago.
Yes, but he was privy to our trial strategy.
So I won't ask about trial strategy.
This is about the prosecution perjuring themselves.
In what way?
We believe there's an active wiretap.
Believe. Your Honor. This is a fishing expedition.
Yeah, but it's actually pretty specific
for a fishing expedition.
I'm gonna overrule, but...
be ready for a great Monty Python-sized boot
coming down on your head, Mr. Lester,
if you stray too far afield.
Got it, Your Honor.
The warrant that you prepared for this hearing, was that
based on the sworn affidavit of DEA Agent Lee Cheswick?
Yes.
Are you aware of any wiretaps that were
in fact the undisclosed basis of this warrant?
Objection. No foundation.
Of course there's no foundation.
If the warrant was fabricated, the foundation's been concealed.
Overruled.
Please answer, Mr. Asher.
Mr. Asher? On advice of counsel,
I refuse to answer on the grounds that
my answer may incriminate me.
Well, we have ourselves a ball game.
Judge, no adverse inference can be drawn
from Mr. Asher's invocation of the Fifth.
Thank you, Counselor. I'm actually familiar with the Constitution.
Do you have any further thoughts?
No, Your Honor.
Well, that went better than expected.
Robyn, what did you say Asher said about the wiretaps?
The thing about it not being about Bishop?
Or the DEA, right?
Have you ever heard of parallel construction?
No.
All right, well,
this is a Reuters article on the NSA.
The NSA?
Yeah.
They've been handing tips gleaned from their surveillance
on to other departments, including the DEA.
What?
Yeah. So...
according to this article,
the DEA can't use classified information to build a case
so it creates a new evidence trail.
Like the real estate witness.
Yeah.
That's parallel construction.
Wait, so...
you're saying that the NSA is surveilling Bishop?
Yeah.
Or us.
You know we're trying to fight terrorists here.
I do know that.
It's a very important job.
You've also been asked to assist our investigation.
We already have a leak from this warrant.
Not from our department.
The target knows she's being surveilled.
Well, again, that's not from my department.
What do you have?
Alicia,
I need to ask you a question.
Marilyn was under the impression that an old friend of yours
could hurt Peter.
Who?
Will.
How?
He found the video.
He's the one who told Peter the votes were fraudulent.
The Feds have nothing unless they have him.
Yes.
That is interesting.
All rise.
Thank you.
You know, this one is tough because... thank you...
on one hand, we have a-a quantity
of cocaine that has been found on the defendant.
Your Honor, we would disp...
And on the other,
we have a witness who doesn't seem
to know one day from another,
and a prosecutor who just won't talk.
Judge, if I may...
You may not.
This is when I talk and this is when you... listen.
Despite Ms. Alvarez's admonition,
the court may and does draw an adverse inference
from Mr. Asher's performance.
I find the warrant at issue
to be compromised, and therefore,
the motion to quash is granted.
You can't cross the line
and then act like you didn't cross the line.
Then shoot me.
Shoot me.
Who's that?
That's his girlfriend.
She's pregnant.
Why does he want to kill her?
She was with his partner.
Okay.
I think this will make sense if I get more wine.
Kluger.
Hi, uh, Judge. Alicia Florrick.
I hope this is a good time.
What can I do for you, Mrs. Florrick?
Oh, I wanted to reschedule our lunch.
You did?
Yes. Uh, to talk about your book.
Well, that's very kind of you.
I've decided not to write that book.
See, publishing is a mug's game.
I'm learning Mandarin.
I see.
Um, well, we could...
Yes, and I've-I've mastered a new phrase.
Zai jian.
It means good night?
Good...
What?
Nothing.
I just feel bad for her.
The Florrick lady?
Don't worry, she'll be all right.
You think so?
No. I don't know.
It's none of our business anyway.
Thanks for seeing me, Mr. Gardner.
Yeah, I had a feeling it was one of those
speak to me now or speak to me later? Kind of things.
Just a few questions.
If any of these questions
touch upon Governor Florrick
in the time I represented him,
then I am bound by attorney-client privilege.
You are not bound
if you were asked to protect an ongoing conspiracy.
What ongoing conspiracy?
The election fraud this video depicts
and the ensuing cover-up you participated in
constitutes an ongoing crime.
Now, if you answer my questions,
I can offer a grant of transactional immunity.
But you have to cooperate fully.
If any of your questions touch upon Governor Florrick
in the time I represented him...
I was under the impression
that Governor Florrick's wife
stole some of your top clients.
You'll really do hard time for him?
If any of your questions
touch upon Governor Florrick...
All right.
This is a subpoena.
Let's see how your resolve stands up
in front of a grand jury.
Or...
you can talk to me now.
It was nice meeting you, Mr. Dubeck.
And you.
See you again very soon.
Can't wait.
