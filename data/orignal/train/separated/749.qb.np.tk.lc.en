oh , my god ! what is that ?
i don &apos;t want to hear it , okay ?
my mother sent it to me .
it belonged to my father .
we have the same exact butt .
what are you wearing ?
what are you wearing ?
i &apos;m dressed for my booty burn boot camp class .
i know what you &apos;re thinking .
it &apos;s not because i need it .
i go to inspire the others .
please take that thing off .
you look like a homeless pencil .
i will not take it off . i have a pass .
a pass ? what kind of pass ?
a dead dad pass .
which means i can do what i want when i want
and no one can say anything about it .
like right now , i want to tap dance ,
and you , jess , you cannot tell me that this isn &apos;t tap .
nick , that &apos;s just not tap !
my dad died !
i &apos;m sorry . it &apos;s just not .
hey , y &apos;all . look at these fancy invites .
do you think it &apos;s to a gala event ?
i &apos;ve always wanted to go to a gala event .
what the hell are you wearing ?
dead dad pass .
oh , my god ! it &apos;s cece &apos;s wedding .
wait a minute .
it &apos;s in three weeks ?
she didn &apos;t tell me it was in three weeks .
cece didn &apos;t give me a plus @-@ one .
how dare she not give me a plus @-@ one .
you can &apos;t invite an ex to a wedding and
not give him the dignity of consolation sex .
girl better recognize .
schmidty gonna go get his plus @-@ one .
ew , nick , what are you doing ?
dead dad pass .
i have not technically been asked to be maid of honor ,
but i am throwing cece &apos;s
surprise bachelorette party here tonight ,
and the only males invited are strippers ,
so oil up or get out , guys .
seriously though , this is a really big deal for her .
some girls plan their weddings ,
cece planned her bachelorette party .
i want to have the dirtiest bachelorette party of all time .
then you better have it in a pigpen .
no , i mean i want strippers and a mechanical bull
and balloons in the shape of ding dongs ,
and i want to wear the kind of underwear
that goes between your cheeks .
i &apos;m also gonna need your help .
oh , god . we could &apos;ve left .
see . you know what ?
we had ample opportunity to leave .
i saw it coming miles away ,
me , too .
and did nothing .
no .
i just need you to kidnap shivrang
so i can get cece alone .
roughhouse him a little bit , drop him off in the desert
till he don &apos;t breathe no more ?
what ? !
i &apos;m so happy you guys could come help .
all the way from india .
aw , look at all the ladies bonding .
this is so exciting . you know ,
grandmother and ankita auntie just couldn &apos;t wait to meet you .
just a little overwhelmed .
i &apos;m gonna take a ...
i know .
wait , listen .
look , babe . just think .
when all of this madness is over ,
you and i will finally get to , you know ...
what are you doing ?
freaking me out .
you know , make love .
which i am personally looking forward to greatly .
and we &apos;ll already be married forever .
i &apos;ll @-@ i &apos;ll get it .
hello ...
shivrang ? what are you doing here ?
i , uh ... you stole my question .
hi . how are you doing ?
my invitation didn &apos;t have a plus @-@ one .
if this is a mistake , i would just like an apology
for the pain that you &apos;ve caused me .
also reimbursement for all travel expenses .
not a mistake . there &apos;s no plus @-@ one .
who is this ?
i &apos;m gerard depardieu .
who do you think i am , lady ? i &apos;m schmidt .
get in my room right now , schmidt .
move . i &apos;m going to your room right now .
hey , you listen to me . that is my future family , okay ?
you cannot speak like that in front of them .
and , no , you cannot have a plus @-@ one .
this wedding has a budget .
plus @-@ ones are for spouses and serious partners only .
so you just assume that
i won &apos;t have a serious partner by then ?
i know for a fact you won &apos;t , okay ?
you &apos;re not a relationship guy , and that is fine .
i can do anything i put my mind to .
i once figured out alyssa milano &apos;s phone number
just by randomly choosing numbers .
every girl that i &apos;ve ever slept with wants to be my girlfriend .
it &apos;s just the way that it is .
if you have a real girlfriend by the time of the wedding ,
i will happily give you a plus @-@ one .
challenge accepted .
not a challenge .
time to go make some dreams come true .
i ...
hey , ladies .
i just want to thank you all for coming on such short notice
for cece &apos;s last night of freedom .
hi , models .
hi . hi . i &apos;m a lawyer .
i &apos;m sadie .
i &apos;m a lesbian .
hey . hi . hi , lesbian .
i &apos;m 39 weeks large right now .
i can &apos;t stand for more than 60 seconds
but just wanted to say i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m so excited
to be raging with you all .
so bring on the cranberry juice , right ?
i need this .
it &apos;s really weird .
you &apos;re acting really weird .
so many models .
i know . i know .
so many .
you can look . don &apos;t touch .
one more thing ? i am a doctor
if anyone &apos;s got any areas they want ... looked at .
i &apos;m fine to take a peek . that &apos;s too much .
don &apos;t make me call your wife .
oh , my god ! oh , my god !
cece &apos;s here . everybody assume surprise positions !
she &apos;s coming . cece &apos;soming .
i don &apos;t get what &apos;s happening .
i &apos;m just gonna run upstairs
and quickly grab a cd from jess .
i &apos;ll come , too .
that &apos;s okay . i ... i &apos;ll be really fast .
i want to see what your friends are like .
have fun .
okay .
it &apos;s gonna be great . it &apos;s just jess .
okay .
bye .
i @-@ i &apos;ll be right here .
hey , nick . sorry , i thought you were jane lynch .
jane lynch . nice ...
nice wheels , man .
yeah , thank you .
i &apos;m a bit of a car man myself . well ,
you know i decided to ...
right on . good for you .
go for some ...
winston ! oh , take the car . take the car .
i &apos;m gonna beat your ass with an athletic stick , boy !
winston ! winston !
jess said to kidnap him , so that &apos;s what i &apos;m doing .
it &apos;s a figure of speech , you idiot .
you nervous ?
uh @-@ huh .
surprise ! surprise !
it &apos;s your bachelorette party !
jess , i ...
love it ? i know .
complete with your favorite game ,
pin the dong on the shivrang !
pin the dong ! pin the dong !
oh . hello . oh .
um , jess , this is ankita @-@ ji ,
shivrang &apos;s aunt all the way from india .
hello .
ankita @-@ ji , this is jess ,
my non @-@ blood related best friend .
welcome ... to california .
may i please use your restroom ?
i need to wash my hands .
yes , of course . it &apos;s down the hall . um , also
there &apos;s a very sexually aggressive message on the mirror
and i apologize for that .
pin the dong . pin it .
i can &apos;t .
come on , cece . get the bull &apos;s @-@ eye .
i haven &apos;t seen shivrang &apos;s penis .
it &apos;s that small ?
you still know where it goes though .
just hit me . i &apos;m about to commit the rest of my life
to a man that i have never seen naked .
cece , chances are he has , like ,
a standard garden @-@ variety penis .
and if we &apos;re all really honest with ourselves ,
isn &apos;t it all about the gonads ?
am i right , ladies ?
no . no .
i &apos;m trying to make her feel better .
and ankita cannot hear anything about this , all right ?
she will not understand . you guys have to promise
to keep it g @-@ rated tonight .
cece , you &apos;ve dreamt of this party your whole life .
i wouldn &apos;t want to change it .
no .
really ?
i can &apos;t .
really ?
i can &apos;t .
okay .
cece , what if it looks like an old carrot ?
what if it &apos;s curly ?
oh , god .
if he &apos;s using it right ,
no one &apos;s seeing his penis .
okay , i &apos;m gonna fix this .
so , if jess is throwing cece a surprise bachelorette party ,
does that make this my surprise bachelor party ?
you shut that pretty mouth of yours , romeo ,
before i fill it with fire !
hey , you gotta ease up , winston .
i got to go .
oh , no , no , no .
i got a call .
no , don &apos;t . please .
i need a picture of shivrang &apos;s penis .
dead dad pass ! new topic !
cece &apos;s really freaking out .
she hasn &apos;t seen his penis .
for the love of god ,
dead dad pass .
and i need it to scale ,
so please put , like ,
a nickel or a big toe
or a golf pencil in there for reference .
it &apos;s not gonna happen !
one picture and you can come home .
give me 20 minutes .
if you want to end this ,
we need to get a photo of shivrang &apos;s penis .
there it is .
cool .
hey , shivrang ! we &apos;re liars , man !
we are throwing you
a good old @-@ fashioned american bachelor party !
bachelor party ! yeah !
whoa ! whoa ! hey ! what are you ...
stop .
what is wrong with you ? !
i know .
why don &apos;t we talk about some of the things
that we love about shivrang ?
i &apos;ll start . um ...
he has really good taste in magazines .
this sucks !
boring !
so lame .
jess , let &apos;s put in the slideshow that you made for cece .
no , i don &apos;t think that &apos;s a good idea .
yes ! time for porn cinema .
no !
oh , my god , no !
oh , my god . no . guys , guys ...
how are we gonna get a picture of shivrang &apos;s junk ?
well , spoiler alert :
women are liars .
yeah . yeah .
they &apos;re supposed to want commitment , right ?
but then i offer it to them on a silver platter
and they throw it back in my face like a comedy pie .
i know this is awkward because we slept together ,
and i never returned
any of your phone calls ,
so this might come as a shock to you ,
but ... will you be my girlfriend ?
oh , god .
i thought you had herpes .
but no to the girlfriend , you dick .
do you remember two years ago
when we were watching coverage of the bp oil spill
and doing it during the commercials
and then you asked me if i wanted a serious relationship
and i laughed in your face ?
well , my new answer ... is yes .
be my girlfriend !
what &apos;s that all about ?
cream cheese in bulk ?
i mean , it &apos;s possible that cece &apos;s right .
i mean , maybe i &apos;m just not
a serious relationship kind of guy .
what are you talking about ?
you dated elizabeth for , like ...
for years .
yeah .
elizabeth ?
yeah , but elizabeth doesn &apos;t count .
she was during my &quot; big guy &quot; period .
so you like the foot rub ? softer ? harder ?
that &apos;s perfect , big guy .
look at all these little toes .
all my little toesies feel so good when you rub &apos; em , though .
this little ... this little one went to market .
if elizabeth doesn &apos;t count ,
then why is it seared into my brain forever ?
you were awfully salty about that .
she counts .
we need to make cece jealous ,
and i don &apos;t think that &apos;s the route we want to take .
then go to the wedding alone .
oh . well , then , go with elizabeth .
great idea , winston . i &apos;m gonna ask elizabeth .
yeah . you were of no help to me , nick .
that &apos;s what ... my whole thing about the whole thing
with elizabeth was that i was also suggesting ...
thanks , guys .
you &apos;re an idiot , dude .
you &apos;re the worst .
you guys were ...
how did you know we were here ?
oh ! oh , i just couldn &apos;t decide .
your country &apos;s refusal to embrace robbie williams
will forever baffle me .
well , i got to say , we &apos;re really glad
you &apos;re back at the table with us , shivrang .
shivrung .
let &apos;s play a classic
bachelor party game right now .
mm @-@ hmm , all right .
i &apos;m gonna take a photo of my junk .
oh , no , you &apos;re not .
yeah , i am . &apos; cause this is what we do in america , shivrang . what ?
i work here . it doesn &apos;t matter .
they &apos;re not gonna fire me .
oh , okay .
yeah , yeah , it &apos;s fine .
okay . yup .
just ...
that is my junk in a photo . okay .
it &apos;s your turn , shivrang . take a photo of your junk .
oh , no . no , thanks .
we &apos;re all doing it .
no , it &apos;s not ... absolutely not .
i &apos;m begging you .
but i will get us another round of drinks .
take the photo ...
take the picture , shivrang .
who fancies a shandy ?
what the hell is that ?
it &apos;s a drink .
two for you guys coming right up .
cece actually designed that toilet .
cece was a volunteer nurse , and , um ...
no bottoms ?
you know , what @-@ what happens in orlando stays in orlando .
nadia , seriously , turn it off .
cece , is this how you like to spend time with your friends ?
is this the kind of wife you want to be ?
no , no . it &apos;s not at all , okay ?
i didn &apos;t even know this party was happening .
it was a surprise .
i promise you , this is so not me .
i didn &apos;t want any of it .
cece , you wanted a bachelorette party
ever since i &apos;ve known you .
why do you have to pretend to be somebody you &apos;re not ?
what are you saying ?
i &apos;m just saying ,
this is all moving really , really fast ,
and maybe you need to get to know shivrang a little bit more ,
and maybe you need to slow this down
so he can get to know you .
i &apos;m getting married in three weeks .
are you saying that i shouldn &apos;t get married in three weeks ?
no . i &apos;m just saying that maybe you should ...
i knew it ! i knew it !
you have been against this wedding from the beginning .
fine ! i don &apos;t think you should marry shivrang
if it means you have to change who you are .
yeah , well , i don &apos;t need to take relationship advice
from a girl who &apos;s in the middle of a seventh grade debacle
with a boy across the hall !
&quot; oh , i &apos;m a single adult , and i kissed another &quot;
&quot; single adult . what &apos;s gonna happen ? &quot;
&quot; does nick like me ? &quot;
&quot; i better go pick out a party dress . &quot;
&quot; i wear pajama sets ! &quot;
you question my pajamas ,
you make me question our entire friendship .
let &apos;s say it , jess !
you never asked me
to be your maid of honor .
it &apos;s awful hot in here .
who wants to cool down with a double scoop of alfredo ?
not now , alfredo !
seriously ?
congratulations , cece .
well , chaps , i guess we &apos;ll just have to make our own .
but first , i have to use the bathroom .
see you in a minute . this is fun .
are you thinking what i &apos;m thinking ?
fire ... !
real fire . this fire is real .
fire !
what are you doing ? you were supposed to take the picture .
aah ! it &apos;s burning so fast !
go put it out ! you ... oh !
look , you guys are acting really , really peculiar .
what is going on ?
what is going on ... is that , uh ...
recent i &apos;ve been one @-@ half orphaned .
i &apos;m sorry .
my @-@ my dad passed away .
we orphans , man !
and it would mean the world to us--
not so much--
if , uh ...
i miss walt so much .
if we can get a photo of your penis .
wait . what ? i &apos;m sor ...
it would help with the grieving , it would just ...
for walt , man .
all right , all right , enough !
okay .
we need a photo for ... for cece .
cece ?
yeah . she &apos;s freaking out
&apos;cause she &apos;s never seen you naked .
and she &apos;s afraid it looks all funky .
so just show us that it looks regular ,
and we all go home .
she &apos;s freaking out ?
look , guys , i &apos;ve @-@ i &apos;ve got to go .
i have ... i have to talk to her .
oh , you &apos;re ... we &apos;re all in the same car . ugh !
you know , i &apos;m gonna take care of this .
how are you gonna take of this ?
crop , rotate , rotate ... and send .
what are you doing ?
i mean , this .
i just send a picture
of your penis to jess ...
no !
... and told her it was shivrang &apos;s .
no !
so now , we good .
you did not just do that .
shivrang .
what , shivrang ?
shivrang , what ?
what ? no , nothing . it &apos;s nothing . don &apos;t .
oh , my god . &quot; shivrang &apos;s shiv &quot; ?
you got your idiot roommates
to kidnap my fiance
well , you were freaking out !
to take a picture of his penis ?
well , let &apos;s see it .
what &apos;s this ?
three more weeks of winter .
oh , my god .
what are you doing ?
get out !
sorry . i &apos;m so sorry . i immediately regret that .
show me !
okay .
you are scared
because you haven &apos;t seen your future husband &apos;s manhood .
where i come from , women cry about this for days .
this is real .
this is not a dream .
look , i &apos;ve kept off the weight .
you knew me when action sandals
were my necessary footwear .
what do you want ?
why do you think i want something ?
because i dated you for four years .
i know when you want something .
what do you want ?
i would like to take you to a wedding ,
because i miss you so much ...
no , i can &apos;t take you seriously
when you &apos;re wearing such tight pants .
get to the point .
okay , look , my model ex @-@ girlfriend
is getting married to some small little indian man
who i just don &apos;t understand .
okay , and i want you to pretend to be my girlfriend
so she gets very sad , and then , breaks off the wedding ,
and then , runs away with me .
no . not a chance .
no ?
wait , wait , wait , please .
elizabeth ?
i &apos;m only gonna say this once .
you were the greatest boyfriend .
i loved big guy .
but then , you lost weight , and you got mean .
you stopped listening to me .
you changed completely .
you stopped paying for my dinner .
elizabeth , to be fair ,
at that point , you were eating the lion &apos;s share of the food .
and you were sitting there eating one basil leaf ,
looking like an idiot panda bear .
well ...
look , i loved big guy
with all my heart .
but i have no interest in helping the guy
who &apos;s standing in front of me now .
i hate your hair .
and i looked , and i looked ,
and i couldn &apos;t find it . where is it ?
and then , i realized ,
that is not his leg .
oh , hey , uh , jess , uh , please tell me ...
that nobody &apos;s looked at your photos in your phone .
um ... you &apos;re too late .
cece looked at it .
we all looked at it .
prize hog , shivrang .
yeah , &apos; cause ...
i &apos;m so sorry they made you do it .
oh , it &apos;s okay .
actually , it wasn &apos;t mine .
what ? !
what ? !
whose was it ?
it was mine .
what ? ! no way !
yeah , it was , uh ... those were my privates .
are you serious ?
i &apos;m serious . give me my phone .
i want it back now .
i have a dead dad pass .
no .
i have a dead dad pass !
no . no ! no ! it &apos;s my property !
what is going on here ?
and why is alfredo crying in the elevator ?
hello , you .
what &apos;s up , nadia ?
it &apos;s just ... it &apos;s just that
there &apos;s so much we don &apos;t know about each other , and i ...
it &apos;s fine . that &apos;s it . i &apos;m showing it to you .
i &apos;m showing you my software .
no , no , no ! no , no !
it &apos;s called hardware , jack .
yeah .
if it run , i catch it .
i mean , i don &apos;t want to see it . i do .
but not @-@ not ... not here .
i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s just , you know , i @-@ i ...
sometimes it feels like we &apos;re just moving so fast ,
and i feel crazy that we &apos;re just ...
jumping in blindly .
but maybe that &apos;s what makes this special .
it &apos;s just a real leap of faith , shivrang .
yeah , uh , but look , the first thing
that you need to know about me is
that it &apos;s actually pronounced shivrung .
i don &apos;t know how to pronounce your name ? !
no , no . you were just so pretty ,
i didn &apos;t want to correct you .
but look , the most important thing
is that i am gonna do my best
to make you the happiest woman on the face of the earth .
shavvy &apos;s getting nasty .
shavvy a dog .
shavvy ?
we &apos;re friends now .
dead dad pass .
look , cece ...
i just wanted to say that
if i was ever selfish in our relationship ...
what do you mean &quot; if , &quot;
and what do you mean , &quot; relationship &quot; ?
that &apos;s fair . um ...
if i was ...
i sincerely apologize .
so , challenge unaccepted . i don &apos;t want a plus @-@ one .
i &apos;m really happy for you .
thank you .
good night , schmidt .
schmidty out .
i just want to say , um , i &apos;m really sorry about ...
no . i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m ... i &apos;m sorry .
and there &apos;s , uh ...
there &apos;s something i &apos;ve been wanting to ask you .
it &apos;s not traditional in indian weddings
to have a maid of honor , but ...
i would really love it if you would be mine .
yeah . i mean , i don &apos;t know ...
what ? !
yes ! oh , my god , thank you so much for asking me !
i paid . all yours , no judgments .
why &apos;d you come back , schmidt ?
the big guy is ...
well , he &apos;s still somewhere inside
this ... perfect body .
he needs you to coax him out a little bit .
please tell him what to do next .
eat the pizza .
eat all the pizza ...
while i watch ... right now .
okay .
oh . it &apos;s so greasy .
so many covers .
hey , guy . oh , boy .

is this your happy dance , big boy ?
how about that ?
oh , there he is .
here &apos;s my big guy .
it &apos;s like i &apos;m waking up from a bad salad dream .
