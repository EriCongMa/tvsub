kate says &quot; adios &quot; to you at prison
and gets busy with her disappearing act .
missed her by two days .
where &apos;d she go ?
she &apos;s a ghost , man .
she did an outstanding job of melting away .
kate ! kate ! !
she &apos;s being held by someone .
she &apos;s too scared to say who .
interpol told me the man
who has kate is with the fbi .
you think it &apos;s fowler .
i do now .
what &apos;s he want from you ?
could be anything .
i &apos;m not done with this investigation , burke .
neither am i.
neal , neal , he &apos;s close .
the man with the ring ?
yes .
he wants something .
who is he ?
i can &apos;t tell you .
please just tell me where you hid everything .
hello , kate .
hello , peter .
we need to talk about neal .
kate .
if only there were some way
to compare this to your life .
i get it , moz . i &apos;m a pawn .
your analogy lacks creative thinking .
you &apos;re upset because it &apos;s accurate .
see , kate has reign over the entire board
while your movements are more ...
restricted .
fowler has to be lying about peter .
there &apos;s no way he has kate .
neal , everyone has a price .
and peter &apos;s been in the perfect position
to control everything .
i hate to give the suit credit , but he &apos;s smart .
i know him .
there &apos;s no way he could do it .
if you &apos;re so sure , then prove it .
find the ring ...
... you find the king .
that &apos;s if he has it .
i &apos;m the bishop , if you were wondering .
i wasn &apos;t . oh .
do you trust him ?
look , he &apos;s the guy you want for this .
well , you didn &apos;t answer my question .
morning , peter .
morning . agent landry , meet neal caffrey .
the con man turned fbi consultant .
my reputation precedes me .
well , you &apos;re hard to miss .
you took a swan dive out of a judge &apos;s chamber
into a bakery awning .
i really don &apos;t like that picture .
but they do have the greatest cake in town .
what &apos;s up ?
agent landry is here from the dallas field office .
he &apos;s following a boiler @-@ room case .
actually , i &apos;m just still catching burke up
on the details .
nice to meet you .
oh , yeah .
you think caffrey is the right man for this job ?
oh , yeah .
he &apos;s a criminal .
so are the guys in the boiler room .
look , i busted him for bond forgery .
i know the story .
then the guy breaks out of prison .
three months left on a four @-@ year sentence .
then he &apos;s an idiot .
no . no .
it was for a girl .
well , it looks like he could have his pick .
yeah , well , there &apos;s something special about kate .
point is , she &apos;s no longer an issue .
you got a tracking anklet on him ?
how &apos;s that work ?
we can pull a map on his movements at any time .
when he &apos;s working or with me ,
we don &apos;t worry about it .
when he &apos;s off the clock , he &apos;s on a two @-@ mile radius .
he goes outside that , we get an alert .
look , you need somebody who can sweet @-@ talk their way
into a high @-@ pressure sales environment .
he &apos;s your guy .
thanks .
got some rangers tickets -- box seats .
you guys interested ?
okay .
this is a boiler @-@ room scam .
we &apos;ve got an office full of junior gordon gekkos ,
selling bad stock .
it &apos;s a classic pump and dump .
guy in charge buys half a million shares of dollar stocks
gets his boys to inflate the price
by selling it over the phone ,
then dumps his stock when it peaks ,
leaving our buyers holding worthless shares .
people are losing their homes over this .
guy last month got taken for $ 50,000 .
he &apos;s got three kids
and no roof to put over their heads now .
the average victim of this scam loses nearly 30 grand .
so we need to shut this room down .
room is mobile ?
they &apos;ve run this operation four times now .
every time they dump the stock , they pick up ,
move to another location .
who &apos;s the guy in charge ?
that &apos;s what we &apos;re trying to figure out .
landry has got somebody on the inside ,
a female informant .
female .
how did she work her way into the boys &apos; club ?
she hasn &apos;t .
that &apos;s why we &apos;re sending in someone who can .
someone who can hustle with the best of &apos; em .
i guess we won &apos;t be drawing straws .
all right , you &apos;re gonna interview with a guy named brad .
of course his name is brad .
you think i can keep up with these guys ?
peter , i &apos;m flattered .
oh , give me a break .
you could sell light switches to the amish .
madison cookler -- that &apos;s our girl on the inside .
yeah . exactly .
she won &apos;t know who you are .
what &apos;s her role in all this ?
the guys transfer the calls ,
after they make a sale , to her .
she takes down all the buyer &apos;s information .
but thanks to her , we know exactly what kind of stocks
these guys are looking to hawk .
we went fishing with several of our own front companies .
they took the bait on that one .
rhymer pharmaceutical .
and you got a tap on every phone in the place .
yep . we &apos;re recording every call .
but the sales are real .
we just want to know who &apos;s behind it all .
so do i.
what &apos;s that ?
nothing .
for me ?
peter , i didn &apos;t get you anything .
&quot; for me ? peter , i didn &apos;t get you anything . &quot;
we call it an eagle .
recorder , transmitter , gps .
keep it on you at all times .
love it .
we need to cut your anklet on this one .
love it even more .
no , you don &apos;t .
after your last escape ,
we need a home run .
a lot of people think i made a mistake .
well , let &apos;s prove them wrong .
yeah . or else you &apos;re headed back to maximum security .
glad some things never change .
madison , give me some good news .
two closes , 3,200 shares .
yes , that is what i like to hear .
yeah , don &apos;t get your hopes up .
i already got dibs on that one .
does she know that ?
since when does that matter ?
i &apos;m brad .
you must be , uh ... nick halden ?
guilty as charged .
your u5 says you were terminated from lehman brothers .
yeah , the market crashed . haven &apos;t been feeling the love .
oh , you couldn &apos;t find a job working anywhere else ?
i wasn &apos;t interested .
i want to make some real cash .
listen , our turnover rate is huge .
high volume , high money .
you make sales , you get paid .
you know what ?
don &apos;t waste time taking down client information .
just transfer over to the girls over there . they mop up .
it &apos;s women &apos;s work , anyway , right ?
yeah , okay . let &apos;s do this .
hang on a second . i haven &apos;t hired you yet .
you , take a break .
let &apos;s start your interview .
you gonna give me some numbers ?
yes . take your pick .
this 216 area code feels lucky .
you got that ? 216 .
cleveland . getting ready to reroute the call now .
is there anybody in particular you want me to send it to ?
come on , newbie .
mr. charles fairweather is waiting
for the deal of a lifetime .
what am i selling him ?
the dream , which today is rhymer pharmaceutical .
hello ?
mr. fairweather .
speaking .
my name is nick halden , and i want to be your broker .
i &apos;ve already got a broker .
really ? how &apos;s he doing for you ?
he make any money last year ?
nobody made any money last year .
that &apos;s not true .
if you were with me , you would have netted 3 % .
and that &apos;s after the crash .
i don &apos;t believe you .
well , you got an e @-@ mail address .
i &apos;ll send you my earnings report right now .
biotech and alcohol were up .
how did you get my number ?
your old broker .
he &apos;s not smart enough to keep you to himself .
what do you do for a living , charlie ?
i &apos;m a history teacher , but i &apos;m not interested ...
&quot; the only history that &apos;s worth a damn
is the history we make today . &quot;
you know who said that ?
i believe henry ford said that .
yes . yes , he did , and he was right .
have you heard of rhymer pharmaceutical ?
no .
of course you haven &apos;t .
&apos;cause your job is to teach ,
and my job is to know about companies like rhymer
before everyone else .
you know when you don &apos;t buy a stock ?
when your cab driver tells you about it .
now , if you &apos;d known about ibm
before the invention of the microchip ,
would you have bought in ?
of course .
well , rhymer is poised for a breakout on the same scale .
monday , the fda will approve them to begin clinical trials
on a quantum confined nanotechnology
that has the potential to transform cancer medicines .
and i can get you in on the ground floor .
that sounds like insider trading .
not at all . no , it &apos;s completely legit .
i pore over a thousand pages of scientific technical b.s.
so i can make you rich at 3 bucks a share .
let &apos;s start small , okay ? a thousand shares .
i double that for you next week , and then we get serious .
sounds nice , but i &apos;d have to ask my wife .
oh . your sale just died , rookie .
mr. fairweather , if you invest with me ,
the only question you &apos;ll have to ask your wife
is what kind of hardwood floors
does she want in her new house .
i don &apos;t know .
life comes down to a few moments , mr. fairweather .
this is one of them .
he &apos;s good .
i &apos;m in .
but let &apos;s make it 5,000 shares .
thank you .
i &apos;ll transfer you over to one of our girls ,
and she &apos;ll take your information .
so , how did my interview go ?
yes ! yeah !
yes ! yes ? !
believe me , i wouldn &apos;t be giving you this information
if i didn &apos;t feel confident enough
to own a few thousand shares myself .
what do you mean you don &apos;t invest over the phone ?
the cuban missile crisis was solved with a phone call .
we have to move on this right now .
you don &apos;t get rich buying into a high market .
the market is down .
what do you need , an engraved invitation ?
look , you want the good things in life ?
what are you gonna do ? are you gonna work harder ?
no , you &apos;re gonna invest smarter .
oh , jones , turn that down .
the college tuition is gonna be covered .
see , now you &apos;re starting to talk like a smart investor .
look , this is a stepping @-@ stone to your first million .
all right , i appreciate your business .
come on , crazy eight , let &apos;s go .
crazy eight ?
no ? eh .
you land close to eight whales in one day ,
you can buy your own nickname .
time to hit the bars !
oh , no , we &apos;re not going with them .
why not ?
he wants to meet you .
who ?
the man behind the curtain .
if caffrey goes out of range , we &apos;ll lose his audio .
that &apos;s okay . he &apos;s still recording .
that &apos;s him ?
avery phillips . the guy in the left .
avery phillips is the youngest guy
to have a seat on the new york exchange .
he &apos;s the man with the plan .
he finds the stocks , fronts the cash ,
we do the legwork .
who &apos;s he talking to ?
his business partner .
partner looks upset .
usually they work together .
our room is all avery ,
which is why they &apos;re not exactly simpatico right now .
keep that to yourself .
you must be my new rainmaker .
yeah .
i see you &apos;re having problems with your associate .
bro .
i don &apos;t want to get pinched
because you &apos;re having domestic troubles .
you &apos;ve got balls .
i like that .
what my business partners and i discuss
isn &apos;t of your concern .
so go relax . have fun .
not cool .
it &apos;s a little early for you
to be calling it a night , isn &apos;t it ?
yeah , well , i got the man behind the curtain .
his name is avery phillips .
all right , i want to get moving on this .
meet me in the office in an hour .
i &apos;m in your neighborhood .
why don &apos;t we meet at your place ?
my place ?
yeah , it &apos;s a little late for the plant bureau walls .
besides , you have better coffee
yeah , i do .
coffee , my dear .
oh . thank you , mrs. burke .
you &apos;re welcome .
i was gonna be up in -- what ? -- six hour anyways .
thanks , honey .
all right , let &apos;s see what eve got recorded here .
that &apos;s a good start .
jones ?
hmm ?
lauren &apos;s pulling up intel on phillips .
check your e @-@ mail .
got it .
well , avery &apos;s been very busy .
yeah .
i &apos;m gonna go rummage through your drawers
and steal your most precious belongings .
i &apos;m kidding . i need to go to the bathroom .
upstairs . first door on your left .
leave the seat down when you &apos;re done .
i &apos;ll be damned .
everything all right ?
never been better .
okay .
first door on the left .
find anything ?
oh , hey . uh , maybe .
avery &apos;s credible on paper .
he runs a separate legit brokerage
with this man , daniel reed .
i saw them arguing . they &apos;re partners .
yeah , but they don &apos;t trust each other .
sounds par for the course .
checked with finra .
their business is profitable ,
but something tells me that
avery &apos;s trying to push out reed .
they &apos;ve run the boiler @-@ room scam together
on the side in the past , maybe for startup capital .
but according to your new buddy brad ,
this current shop is all avery .
he &apos;s planning something on his own .
so , let me wrap my head around this for a second .
let &apos;s just say i &apos;m reed .
you &apos;re avery . you &apos;re trying to screw me .
why ?
money . it &apos;s that simple .
isn &apos;t it always ?
so you manipulate your friends and the people around you .
yeah . all to get rid of you .
and i never saw it coming .
what &apos;s with you ?
i found my ring . it &apos;s peter .
i &apos;m so sorry , man . i truly am .
i don &apos;t understand why .
he &apos;s a suit .
this is what they do . are you gonna play it out ?
what choice do i have ?
they &apos;ve got you off your anklet for this one .
you could run .
i &apos;d need some cash .
we can get cash .
so , what are you gonna do ?
get the money .
we know who we &apos;re after .
now all we need is proof
that avery is getting a cut of the profits from the room .
well , can we get the boiler @-@ room books ?
we make that request ,
we tip our hands , and they close shop .
no , we need another way in .
we already set up a company they &apos;re exploiting .
how about we set up a c.e.o. to exploit them ?
where you going with this ?
well , let &apos;s say that the owner of rhymer pharmaceutical
is onto the scam .
so he walks into avery &apos;s office with a proposal .
earning reports and a share of the profits
in exchange for silence .
we create the right backstory ,
give this c.e.o. a working history .
it could fly .
question is , who do we send ?
how about you ?
you look like a guy people can trust .
but i &apos;d also believe you could be bought ,
for the right price .
if you played it right , i mean .
all right , that &apos;s all .
do we have a problem ?
why would there be a problem ?
no , i &apos;m just excited to see you go undercover .
it doesn &apos;t happen very often .
it happens more than you think .
i still have some active aliases .
you &apos;re a man of many faces .
i appreciate your business , ma &apos;am .
i &apos;m gonna transfer you over
to my associate madison .
will you hold on just a moment ?
i &apos;m about to close a sale .
that &apos;s cool .
just don &apos;t transfer the call to madison .
why not ?
just do what you &apos;re told .
what am i , an intern here ?
look , i have no idea what &apos;s going on , all right ?
avery says freeze out madison ,
that &apos;s what we do .
just go to linda for now .
all right .
and , by the way , uh , avery &apos;s having a party
at his place on saturday .
clear your calendar .
you hear that ?
yeah , sounds like they &apos;re getting suspicious
of our inside man .
&quot; woman . &quot;
yeah . &quot; woman . &quot;
i need that ebid analysis tuesday
jason . tuesday .
mr. edison .
glad to meet you .
no , you &apos;re not .
direct . i like that .
i know what you &apos;re doing to my company .
rhymer pharmaceutical isn &apos;t worth all that attention .
tell me why a guy like you is buying all those shares .
you have proof i bought any shares ?
we both know how these games are played .
i may not work on wall street ,
but that doesn &apos;t mean i can &apos;t smell a shark in a suit .
you &apos;re making a move , some kind of a move ,
and you &apos;re setting yourself up big .
that &apos;s what guys like you do .
why are you here , mr . edison ?
bottom line ?
yeah .
i want in .
the money you stand
to make from taking over my company
means that you owe me board membership to your firm .
i &apos;m not talking about controlling interest ,
just a taste of the profit .
or what ?
or i talk to the feds .
or i talk to the shareholders .
do you know who i am ?
yeah , i &apos;ll give you until monday
to give me your projected earnings .
you know what you stand to lose .
i want to know what i stand to make .
tell you what .
i &apos;m having a little get @-@ together this weekend .
i &apos;m not here to be your friend .
if we &apos;re gonna do business off the books ,
we should discuss it off the clock .
fair enough . what do you have in mind ?
pull !
hey , what &apos;s going on over there ?
avery &apos;s doing a little business .
maybe you should mind your own .
you know , you &apos;re a little psycho .
i &apos;m just playing , dude .
come on , crazy eight , you &apos;re on deck , man .
no , no , i &apos;m cool , man .
you already loaded it . you take that shot .
nice place .
well , what can i say ?
i &apos;m a boy with my toys .
what &apos;s life like without a little fun , right ?
how old are you , anyway ?
29 this month .
but just because i &apos;m ahead of the curve
doesn &apos;t mean that i can &apos;t enjoy my success .
hmm .
you want to see something really cool ?
sure .
come with me .
comics .
my prized possessions .
i &apos;ve been collecting since i was a kid .
you still are a kid .
guilty as charged .
i &apos;m peter pan in the flesh .
every kid needs inspiration .
these are mine .
you see this
this is nice .
i could trade that for your car .
you like superheroes .
those that go above and beyond
what the ordinary human can do .
yeah .
that &apos;s you -- minus the cape .
you &apos;ll love this .
this vault is completely tricked out .
if there is a fire , the room clamps down ,
the air is sucked out in 10 seconds .
that &apos;s pretty cool .
damn right .
you steal from me , same thing .
the door shuts ,
you &apos;d die with no air to hear yourself scream .
mr. edison , these are the guys .
guys , this is mr . edison .
who &apos;s up ?
nick is .
no , i &apos;m good , man . you go ahead .
dude &apos;s been passing on us all day .
not really a gun guy .
that &apos;s all right .
let the grownups play with the big @-@ boy toys .
do i know you ?
no , i don &apos;t think you do .
nick , back off , man .
it &apos;s all right .
is there a problem , nick ?
nick , take your shot .
pull .
pull .
just &apos; cause i don &apos;t like guns doesn &apos;t mean i can &apos;t use one .
damn . that was crazy .
why don &apos;t you boys keep this party going ?
you can have a cocktail ...
shoot something .
we &apos;ve got some business to take care of .
hey , man . why is madison here ?
just shoot some birds , man .
they know she &apos;s a mole .
damn it . this is gonna go bad fast .
back my play .
no .
neal , what is wrong with you ?
i saw your ring .
what ?
i know you &apos;ve got kate !
a lot of us have those rings .
not now . back my play .
hey ! avery !
this guy &apos;s been playing you !
you got yourself a spy !
what , are you selling me out now ?
trust me . i &apos;ll explain it later .
i knew i recognized this son of a bitch !
what do you mean ?
search him .
check everything . check his picket .
what is that ?
what is this ?
what is this ?
who are you ?
like he said ...
i &apos;m a spy .
two years ago , this guy tried to extort me on insider trading .
you can &apos;t trust him .
oh , i &apos;m the one you can &apos;t trust ? that &apos;s a good one .
who are you ? s.e.c. ?
fbi ?
you really think the fbi could afford a gadget like that ?
no .
he &apos;s a corporate spy .
who do you work for ?
your partner . daniel reed .
reed ?
you think he doesn &apos;t know what you &apos;ve been planning ?
he &apos;s been onto you for months .
take madison home .
put her in a car , give her a bottle of wine ,
tell her she &apos;s employee of the month .
how do we keep this quiet ?
we &apos;re gonna put him on that trap ,
and we &apos;re gonna launch him off the front lawn .
you really gonna play the whole bad @-@ guy thing ?
you buy him .
flip him on reed .
what &apos;s reed planning ?
he knows you &apos;re gonna cut him out of his half .
he hired me to find out how so he can cut you out first .
how am i supposed to flip him if i can &apos;t even trust him ?
pay me in stock .
i help you , i get rich .
i screw you , i get nothing .
i want 5 % .
got cojones on this one .
i &apos;ll give you 2 % .
3 % .
okay .
3 % .
neal , are you out of your mind ?
peter doesn &apos;t have kate .
you sure about that ?
yes , i am .
how often is he gone , elizabeth ?
how many late nights when you don &apos;t know where he is ?
okay , stop it .
peter is the best thing that ever happened to you ,
and you &apos;re smart enough to know that .
yeah , well ... he has the ring .
that &apos;s your evidence ?
here &apos;s the ring .
it &apos;s a 10 @-@ year fbi pin .
put in 10 years , you get one .
most of us have them made into a ring .
well , i &apos;ve never seen you wear it .
it &apos;s a fraternity thing .
come with us to the next bureau accommodation dinner .
you &apos;ll see hundreds of them .
will i get one ?
no .
i &apos;m sorry , peter .
i promise you , we &apos;ll figure out who it is .
whoever it is is with the bureau .
yep , that is a problem .
but i need you to help me get avery first .
go in and play reed against him .
make him think his partner &apos;s betraying him ?
maybe he &apos;ll do something stupid .
thank you , guys .
it &apos;s all right .
you gonna tell him that you met with kate ?
i don &apos;t think he &apos;d trust me enough for me to tell him
what happened that night .
after the case . then i &apos;ll decide .
now what ?
i want you to tell reed
that we &apos;re gonna dump the stock next friday .
when &apos;s the real dump ?
this friday .
while we &apos;re celebrating ,
he &apos;ll get to watch his stock become completely worthless .
this is brett &apos;s hot dogs , from , i guess ,
wherever they make them -- i &apos;m not sure .
um ... and that &apos;s all we do all weekend -- eat hot dogs .
excuse me .
could you give us a minute , please ?
yeah , go ahead .
thank you .
this better be good .
it is . you know who i am ?
yeah , you &apos;re avery &apos;s new &quot; rainmaker . &quot;
your partner &apos;s cutting you out .
what ?
get lost , kid .
i want you to tell reed
that we &apos;re gonna dump the stock next friday .
when &apos;s the real dump ?
this friday .
while we &apos;re celebrating ,
he &apos;ll get to watch his stock become completely worthless .
that son of a bitch -- i &apos;m gonna kill --
no , you do something ,
you lose your chance to win the upper hand .
why are you telling me this ?
i figured it might be worth something to you .
why do i need you ?
because avery trusts me .
i &apos;m trying to make a profit .
we can take him down , make some money in the process .
and what do you need ?
access .
i want his financial records ,
proof he &apos;s been running these rooms .
we can hold that information over his head .
the problem is , i couldn &apos;t find anything on his home
or office computer .
avery doesn &apos;t trust computers .
cause they &apos;re too easy to hack into .
but he has a ledger .
there &apos;s no paper trail
because he literally keeps it on paper .
find this ledger , and we got him .
we need to figure out where he keeps it .
i know exactly where he keeps it .
this has got to be where avery holds the book --
with his comics .
it &apos;s a perfect location .
yeah , according to the company who installed it ,
we &apos;re dealing with
a state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art fire @-@ suppression system .
it &apos;s the same kind they use in the top museums .
when triggered , a polycarbonate glass wall seals the room ,
and then a hydraulic vacuum sucks out the oxygen .
fire dies , no damage to what &apos;s inside .
and if i &apos;m in there , no air to breathe .
well , there is a kill switch .
but we don &apos;t know where it is .
wonderful .
tech lab has another cool gadget for you .
this mini breather .
it will give you five minutes of air ,
just in case the system is triggered .
it &apos;ll fit perfectly in one of these .
cigar tube -- nice .
fbi &apos;s been watching &quot; thunderball . &quot;
breaking out all the toys on this one , guys .
anything happens , jones and lauren
will be stationed with a unit right outside the property .
five minutes &apos; worth of air .
yep .
what &apos;s your response time ?
roughly five ... minutes .
roughly .
i &apos;ll be at the house to back you up
in case anything goes wrong .
how are you gonna pull that off ?
they &apos;re dumping the shares on friday ,
so everyone &apos;s having a little party to celebrate .
we &apos;re both on the invite list .
so just -- just so i &apos;m clear , um ...
if anything goes wrong , i suffocate .
then we &apos;ll make sure nothing goes wrong .
yeah .
or i can practice holding my breath .
you got the new ferrari yet ?
i do .
twin turbo v8 with adjustable rear spoilers .
quite a piece of metal .
once this deal is done ,
you won &apos;t settle for the street model .
you &apos;ll be able to get the design of pre @-@ release from italy .
ever been to the factory in maranello ?
no .

he is .
this picture was on my desk the same day that you had it .
and you never said anything .
what was i gonna tell you ?
i recognized the ring .
this guy with kate is with the bureau .
i started poking around ,
trying to figure out who it is .
it &apos;s fowler .
i think so .
of course . yeah . you start digging around ,
that &apos;s when he bugged your phone .
yep , the phone , the o.p.r investigation ,
operation mentor -- all of it .
he wanted to know what i was onto .
and that was kate .
i passed word to her saying i wanted to meet ,
talk about you .

five years . first time i caught neal .
what do you want ?
leave neal alone .
i can &apos;t do that .
why not ?
what does neal have that you so desperately want ?
i can get it for you .
why would you do that ?
why ? because he &apos;s good .
because he &apos;s the smartest guy i &apos;ve ever met .
and i &apos;m tired of watching you twist his heart around .
he &apos;s my friend . let him go .
neal stole a piece .
he &apos;s stolen a lot of things .
this one is special .
it &apos;s a music box .
that &apos;s my price .
did you ever love him ?
tell fowler i know , and i &apos;m not backing off .
peter !
don &apos;t push him .
he &apos;s controlling her .
i don &apos;t think so .
she &apos;s not working for him , peter .
neal , when are you gonna face the facts here ?
she may not be on your side .
you &apos;re wrong !
oh , damn it , neal , come on !
i looked into her eyes !
i didn &apos;t see concern for you .
no . this is an angle .
she wants this music box . do you know where it is ?
i might .
come on , you &apos;re gonna cut me off now ?
i know where it is .
good .
so what is it ?
catherine the great had a room in her palace
in st . petersburg made entirely out of amber .
you &apos;ve heard of it ?
yeah , it was dubbed the eighth wonder of the world ,
but nazis looted it in world war ii .
yeah , well , one of the things they took
was an amber music box .
it &apos;s got to be worth a few bucks .
yeah .
but not enough for all this .
there &apos;s something inside it .
it &apos;s holding some secret .
i want to see it .
i &apos;m gonna need some time .
well ... it &apos;s ready .
