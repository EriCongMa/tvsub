You lie.
Would a simple servant of God have this?
You're no more a priest than I am.
Here's your burning bush.
So talk to your god.
This is Burke.
Op-sec 3828.
We have a situation.
第67号
Officer Collins.
Martin Wilcox. We spoke on the phone.
Of course. Detective, thanks for coming.
Susan, this is detective Wilcox with metro P.D.
I've brought him up to speed.
Mrs. Ames, we'll do whatever we can to find your husband.
Thanks.
Eugene disappears sometimes to Atlantic City, once to Vegas,
but he always calls,
and he's never gone for more than a few days.
And I understand there's some incident
that happened before his absence --
Eugene came home.
He said he got an anonymous tip
about trespassers over by one of the marina docks.
The lieutenant went to check it out,
came back about an hour later,
said he got the scare of his life.
He ran into an FBI agent on one of the old ships,
said she pulled out a gun as he was boarding.
An FBI agent?
Said the FBI was looking for two fugitives
who escaped Cumberland the night before.
If something happened to Eugene, it's got to be one of them.
Don't you think?
This agent he spoke with --
Is there any chance your husband got a name?
He did better than that. She gave him a card.
特别探员
Special agent Elizabeth Keen.
I've never seen anything like it.
What is it?
I don't know.
It was...I think it contains some kind of message.
Where'd you get it?
I need you to see if you can figure out
what it is, how it works.
There are people who are far more qualified
at this kind of thing than me.
But none that I know and trust.
I hope I'm interrupting.
Yes.
No. No.
You're not answering your phone.
So leave a message.
Dembe did. Two, in fact.
We have a new case, Agent Keen.
Then tell Cooper.
That's not how this works.
I think I left my soup in the microwave.
Lobster bisque.
I know exactly how this works.
You lie, say what you need to say
to make me believe you actually care --
That's not true.
You're after the fulcrum. It's why you're here.
Not to help me or protect me
or whatever spin you're selling today.
Well, I'm not buying it.
From this point on, there's no reason for us to talk
unless it's about the work.
Fine. Then let's work.
I think you'll find today's most intriguing story on page 20,
bottom-left corner.
"According to Uzbek authorities,
father Aleksandr Nabiyev,
a local priest in the Tashkent region of Uzbekistan" --
You're intrigued because a priest was kidnapped?
No. I'm intrigued because the priest is not a priest.
From what I hear,
he good father Nabiyev is an agent of the CIA.
That's a crime, Agent Keen.
Going back to the cold war,
the CIA has a long and controversial history
of using religious figures as spies
in violation of executive orders,
internal CIA policy,
and promises made by every president since Ford.
And you know who kidnapped this agent?
I do.
Unfortunately, he's an associate of mine.
His name is Ruslan Denisov.
He commands a nasty, little band of separatists
known as S.R.U.
Translated, they are the supreme republic
of a free, righteous, and independent Uzbekistan.
I told Ruslan it was a bit much,
but he can be quite melodramatic,
not to mention violent and entirely unreasonable.
Politics are his passion,
and to fund his separatist agenda,
he's become something of an abduction mogul,
specializing in senior executives of foreign corporations
working in or passing through the region.
He holds them for ransom
at prices far above market standard.
Your company has made it clear
it has no interest in paying for your release.
And you do business with this man?
Don't underestimate the usefulness
of a nasty band of armed separatists.
But lately, Ruslan's been breaking promises.
His temper has cost me and my partners
considerably more than he's worth.
So everybody wins.
You help us rescue the agent,
We eliminate a thorn in your side.
Careful on this one, Lizzy.
You have more than just a blacklister
to worry about this time.
The CIA will do whatever it takes to keep this quiet.
Richard Gagnon, executive V.P.
for a French video-component manufacturer.
Here he is before he was taken...
...and here he is the day S.R.U. released him
in exchange for $2 million cash.
We have a list of over 30 victims.
I don't understand. This guy makes a fortune
taking corporate execs.
Now he takes a CIA Agent.
Why change the business model?
Let's find him and ask.
I'm sorry, but people's faith is sacred.
Religion should be off-limits to spies.
Wouldn't work in my country.
Yeah, well, the agency knows the law,
so they've gone this far,
something big is going on in that area.
It's a simple question, Mr. Heyworth.
Is father Nabiyev an operative of the CIA or not?
We all know that would be illegal.
That's not an answer to my question.
Not to my knowledge.
Look, I didn't call this meeting
to make a case against the agency.
We're here because I have an informant
who I think can help get your man back safely.
If he were our man -- and I'm saying "If" --
the agency would prefer to handle this on its own.
If an American citizen's been kidnapped overseas,
That's FBI jurisdiction.
If he's your asset, I can keep you involved.
If not, you're out.
Agent Cooper, your task force
will run point on the investigation
And any hostage negotiations.
My people can leave tonight.
Commander Kushan.
I'm Agent Keen. This is Agent Ressler.
On behalf of the bureau, we appreciate your help.
Let me be very clear, Agent Keen.
It is you who are here to help me.
This is an Uzbek military operation.
All due respect, sir,
An American citizen has been abducted.
Which is why we have extended the courtesy of our invitation.
But you will not be negotiating with Ruslan Denisov,
and you will not be negotiating with me.
And you will turn over your firearms.
If that's a problem and you wish to return to your country --
No. No problem.
My men will escort you to your hotel.
We're being watched. 1:00.
I didn't notice him.
I was too busy checking out Hugo Boss on the corner.
Whoever he is, he isn't a fed.
That suit wasn't bought on a government salary.
The other one, the watercolorist,
She -- legs like a shot-putter.
She gets me in this headlock.
I black out.
Next thing I know, I wake up, no sheets,
vaseline everywhere.
The lipstick on the mirror overhead reads,
"Same time next year?"
I haven't missed an art expo in Basel since.
Lizzy! Please excuse me.
What are you doing here?
I promised to help.
I can't be an effective resource
If I'm thousands of miles from the action.
It's not safe.
We just saw the CIA at the airport.
They see you...
I'll be sure to say hello.
Uzbekistan has no extradition treaty
with the United States.
Who are your friends over there?
Go get cleaned up. We'll have dinner.
I know a wonderful little hole in the wall
that's actually in a hole in the wall.
What's going on with you and Reddington?
You two have a little lovers' quarrel?
I don't trust him.
Reddington's untrustworthy?
Welcome to my country.
The FBI in Uzbekistan --
for a year, I tried to get your attention.
Now here you are
because the only thing Americans understand is violence.
If you know so much about Americans,
you'd know that our government
doesn't pay ransoms to terrorists.
One man's terrorist, another man's freedom fighter.
I don't want your money -- not for myself, anyway.
As you can see, business is good.
I took your Agent Burke for another reason completely.
Burke -- that's his name?
Almost 25 years ago,
my country sold an American company, Anneca oil,
the rights to build a pipeline
through Tashkent to Andijan region.
The price was absurd.
The Uzbek people received a fraction of the value.
Corruption -- well, you know.
These things happen, and I don't care.
But now, the pipeline is leaking.
Leaking?
Hundreds of villagers have been killed,
hundreds more are sick, and the company does nothing.
Our lawyers are no match for your wealthy attorneys.
The American Embassy looks away.
The CIA is here, watching, doing nothing,
Reporting on any threats to your American interests.
Mr. Denisov --
I took one of theirs.
A vice president of Anneca Oil.
I tell him that there are chemicals in the water that we drink,
that our children bathe in.
But he says no.
The company did tests. The water is safe.
So I did a test of my own.
I give him back to you now to show you my good faith
so you can show the others the truth.
The negotiations for your Agent Burke begin tomorrow.
We saw hostages, at least four.
I don't think Agent Burke was one,
but he's probably there.
We have got to find that compound.
That won't be easy.
The local army can't even find them.
Well, we got your photo of the guy Denisov released --
The Anneca V.P. --
compared it to known company execs
and got a match -- Jeffrey Hanover.
How long ago was he taken?
That's the thing. I don't know.
From what I can tell,
Anneca never reported him missing.
You're kidding.
They tried to handle it privately.
If that pipeline is leaking,
the last thing they want is attention.
Yeah, well, I'll tell you one thing.
Whatever it was eating at Hanover's flesh,
It wasn't just water.
He should survive.
His skin has been burned, corroded.
And the chemicals?
It's certainly consistent
with prolonged exposure to benzene
and polycyclic hydrocarbons
Commonly associated with oil development.
Thank you, doctor.
Agent Ressler. Dean Walker, E.V.P. at Anneca.
Just wanted to say thanks for bringing Jeff home.
It's all part of the job.
I just flew in. Company sent me straightaway.
If there's anything you need, I'm here to help.
Yeah, I doubt that.
We saw you this morning watching us at the airport.
How long have you really been here?
Three weeks.
The company sent me to deal with Denisov,
see if we could work something out.
Privately?
Jeff's family wanted it that way.
They were afraid if the FBI got involved --
Maybe you're the ones who were afraid.
Anneca's got nothing to hide.
This leak Denisov keeps talking about --
he's the one responsible. It's a scam.
His men sabotage the pipeline and then demand a fortune
because the locals are getting sick.
So this is how you respect my operation?
I told you, you have no authority here.
Denisov contacted us.
Commander, I know this is your case,
but if Denisov wants to talk to the FBI --
Not an option.
It's an option if Denisov says it's an option.
He's the one who's holding an American hostage.
Yes, a Frenchman, a German, and many others.
I'm sorry. You can't order us not to talk to him.
I could arrest you and your partner
for interfering in my investigation.
What investigation?
You've been tracking this guy and his group for over a year.
He's still abducting innocent people,
holding them for ransom --
You and your partner
will remain at the Tashlan hotel under military guard.
If you try to leave,
your stay in Uzbekistan
will be a lot longer than you bargained for, hmm?
Well, you certainly make friends fast.
Truth is, I'm impressed.
Not with you, with Ruslan.
He never really struck me as a man of the people.
The guy's a psychopath. He's in over his head.
He doesn't know anything about pipelines.
Agent Keen is late.
She's having room service.
What, are you in the doghouse?
Oh, that's a shame.
She's gonna miss
the most tantalizingly delicious Khorem baklava.
Ruslan's a criminal.
Even if Anneca comes to the table,
Denisov would have no idea what to ask for.
The guy doesn't even know enough to know what he wants.
The lawyers would eat him for lunch.
You may be right.
When's the next sit-down?
Tomorrow morning.
Well, given your new entourage,
I gather you may need my help to attend.
Actually, I think we've got that covered.
Mr. Denisov, thank you for your willingness to talk to us.
The bureau spoke with Anneca Oil,
and the good news is, they want to fix this.
That is good news.
To be honest, I was a little worried.
I mean, who am I? I'm just a criminal.
I don't even know enough to know what I want.
I will not be negotiating this deal myself.
I've decided to bring in a professional,
someone to make sure
that the company lawyers don't eat me for lunch.
Mr. Denisov, it is my pleasure to be here.
Hello.
My name is Raymond Reddington. And you are?
I've spoken to my agents.
They assure me Agent Burke is alive.
So, where are we?
My people are concerned.
They were driven to a village
less than 40 miles from the S.R.U. compound.
They saw the damage being done by the pipeline firsthand.
Wait. Your people know where the compound is located?
They don't know the exact location,
but based on drive time and the terrain they encountered,
we think the compound is somewhere
near the southeast base of the Zarafshan range.
We can have a black-ops team on the ground tonight.
That would be a mistake.
We don't know with certainty if Agent Burke is even there.
I'm willing to take that chance.
And destroy the trust they're trying to build with Denisov
as well as endanger the lives of those still on the ground?
I agree. At this point, a raid is premature.
Agent Cooper, I'm assuming your informant
can be of assistance on this one?
From what I hear, he's right at the center of this.
Then we stay the course for now.
I will see to it
that every one of your interests and expectations
are met or exceeded.
What the hell are you doing?
I'm sorry. It's been a while since I've done one of these.
Did I screw up already?
You're not really gonna negotiate for Denisov, are you?
You're the one who insisted
that our interaction be strictly professional.
You gave us this case to help us get the agent back,
not represent the other side.
Agent Keen, in this world,
there are no sides, only players.
Are we really supposed to sit here
and hammer out a deal?
Absolutely not.
I was thinking we might get out for a bit.
The first day of negotiation
is rather like the first day of school.
Get out? Where?
Let's go on a field trip, shall we?
What you're smelling is benzene,
a common pollutant in oil production.
It's in the air we breathe and the food we eat.
This way.
We boil all our water for drinking.
And add andrographis to counteract the toxins.
Does that work?
No.
Carcinogens are ingested.
And cause melanomas, damage internal organs...
Lung, liver, and kidney failure.
Somewhere, 6,000 miles away,
a group of bean counters in a boardroom
did a cost-benefit analysis.
And concluded that these people aren't worth
the cost of responsibly maintaining their pipeline.
The exec I talked to,
he said your men were sabotaging the pipeline.
Said it was a scam.
My youngest brother died of benzene poisoning last year.
So, who's the hostage here,
Agent Burke or these poor devils?
Look, I don't care what math they did.
No company can ignore this.
It's bad for business.
Only if someone can prove the truth.
Anneca spends a fortune on lobbyists
to make sure that doesn't happen.
Maybe we can contact the State Department,
see if they can apply some pressure...
try and clean up this mess.
And I can see to it
that Agent Burke is released unharmed.
See?
No sides. Only players.
Keen.
Agent Keen. I'm glad I caught you.
You know, you're not an easy woman to reach.
I'm sorry. Who is this?
Detective Martin Wilcox, Metro P.D.
Assistant Director Cooper's office gave me your number.
I hope I caught you at an okay time.
What's up, detective?
I'm looking into this missing-persons case.
The vic actually works for the P.D.
It's a Lieutenant Ames, D.C. Harbormaster.
How can I help?
I heard that you two ran into each other up on one of the harbor rigs.
It looks like you gave him one of your business cards.
Right. Right.
I think you said something about the FBI
searching for fugitives out of Cumberland.
Thing is, I-I've made a few calls,
and nobody seems to know anything about it.
Well, that's because it didn't happen.
It was a cover.
I couldn't share why with the lieutenant at the time.
Is there any chance you can share it with me now?
Might help me clear this case.
I'm sorry.
Well, you're gonna have to tell me something.
I mean, you being out there alone,
drawing your weapon, giving a false story --
it raises some questions.
I've already said more than I can say.
May I ask... Lieutenant Ames
who reported him missing?
His wife. Married 32 years.
Well, I hope you find him, detective.
Good luck.
You told Ruslan the State Department was open
to the idea of an inquiry.
You haven't touched your baklava.
You told him, and he's not interested?
Just one bite.
I didn't come here for the baklava.
I came here to talk about the negotiation.
A Russian milonga.
Watch closely, Lizzy.
Everything you need to know about negotiation
is there in the tango milonga.
We've got eyes on the S.R.U. Compound.
You spoke to Commander Kushan?
Yes, sir. He understands we want this resolved tonight.
I want full deniability for the agency.
Get out in public, far away when this happens.
We've been ordered to stand down,
but local authorities dealing with local issues --
nothing we can do about that.
Understood.
At the outset, they are opponents.
Each has something the other wants.
They size one another up,
Assessing risk, setting boundaries,
Challenging each other to breach them.
A sensuous battle --
violence and sex...
balanced on the blade of a knife.
Nothing given that is not earned --
nothing taken that is not given.
This is the pure essence of negotiation.
Not a poker game, but a milonga.
A tango.
A seduction.
What's wrong?
Everything.
Commander, we have searched all the buildings.
There is no sign of the hostages,
including the American.
When exactly did this happen?
Last night around 2100 hours.
Uzbek special forces are reporting
a full-scale raid of the Compound.
It was the CIA -- the man in the restaurant,
he wanted to be seen in public.
What about Burke?
They went this damn far, they better have found him alive.
According to the official report,
they haven't found him at all.
It was an all-out assault.
At least a dozen S.R.U. fighters
were killed by an army unit led by --
Commander Kushan.
How the hell did he know how to find the Compound?
Heyworth.
That son of a bitch was ordered to stand down.
Who's on the phone?
Cooper.
Harold! Good. I want you to hear this.
Reddington, you know this wasn't our move.
The CIA --
The CIA did what the CIA does.
I expected as much,
which is why Agent Burke and the other hostages
were moved from that compound.
The question is
why on earth you would share the compound's location
with the very people I advised you not to trust.
I'll deal with Heyworth.
Oh, Heyworth is the least of your troubles now.
I warned you about Denisov.
I told you he was violent and unstable.
How do you think he'll react to losing a dozen of his men?
You think he'll kill Burke?
I have no idea.
But now I'm afraid Denisov may not trust me,
and I certainly don't trust you.
The negotiations are over.
I was stupid to trust you!
Ruslan.
I was stupid to think that they respected us
or would deal with us fairly!
Take a breath.
I told you to move the hostages. You did.
Your assets are intact.
He was left behind at the compound,
abandoned by his commander.
Ruslan, he's more valuable alive than dead.
Not to me.
I hope that made you feel better.
Apparently not.
The CIA killed you, you understand?
They did this!
Sacrifice the bishop.
Reykjavik, '72.
God, I can remember it like it was yesterday.
I was in Steven Bash's rec room down in the basement,
eating fried egg and bologna sandwich
when he did it.
Did what? Who did?!
Bobby Fischer.
It was game 13, move 50 --
Rook takes bishop, B5.
He sacrificed his bishop.
That's when Russia lost the cold war.
It was staggering.
Spassky had no answer because he had no endgame,
and neither do you.
When you capture and kill a C.E.O.,
you incur the wrath of a company.
When you capture and kill a CIA agent,
you incur the wrath of the U.S. government.
That's boots on the ground, drones overhead.
What will be your answer to that?
My men were murdered.
A message has to be sent.
You're only seeing the next move.
People have been pillaging your country's resources
since time began.
Someone has to offer a better alternative.
That someone could be you.
Ruslan, there is an endgame here that you don't yet see.
But you see it, don't you, Agent Burke?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Denisov here is so blinded by anger,
he thinks this problem started when he became aware of it.
But you and I both know that's not true.
Why don't you tell us about Zhabin?
I don't know anything.
The CIA put you here for a reason.
They violated their own policy and federal law
to hide you among locals
because there's a secret they want to protect.
Now tell us about Zhabin.
No.
Make no mistake, Mr. Burke.
My friend here is still making
the bed he'll have to lie in for the rest of his life.
But my bed is made, and I assure you
my bed accommodates a broad spectrum of behavior.
So you tell us what little you know about Zhabin,
or I'll put you in the ground myself.
Give me the gun.
Leonid Zhabin --
He's the former cabinet minister,
part of the old Soviet Regime.
Ran this whole region from the late '70 th the early '90s.
A ruthless, corrupt, evil man.
He gave Anneca the right to build the pipeline.
And in return, he got a massive kickback
and piece of the ownership interest.
Possibly insane, very religious now,
as if that can save him.
All these sick people are his fault.
Maybe he doesn't like you.
For you, I'm afraid absolution
won't be quite so easy to obtain.
I need all the details
exactly how the Anneca oil rights were sold,
for how much, including gratuities,
contingencies, and all the participants.
I want absolution in the next world,
not a life in prison in this one.
Understandable.
But it's the confession, not the priest,
that gives us absolution.
The U.S. Government says this isn't torture.
What do you think?
Let me talk, please.
Look at yourself.
Rich as Croesus,
and you let Anneca Oil poison your own countrymen.
We didn't just poison our countrymen.
We killed them, hundreds of them.
Looks like we're hostages now, too.
Ressler, I think I'm in trouble.
You think you...
I got a call from Metro P.D.
They've got a missing-persons case,
the D.C. harbormaster.
He showed up where I was holding Tom.
Whatever you're about to confess, Keen, don't.
I didn't kill him. I didn't.
It was Tom.
Tom?
Why would Tom kill
the one person in a position to rescue him?
To protect me.
I realize how insane that sounds.
I met the harbormaster the first time he showed up
and gave him my card,
told him I was there searching for two fugitives.
You lied to him.
To explain why I was there.
I had no idea Tom would kill him.
I tried to stop it.
Was there witnesses?
Somebody must have been watching Tom
while you weren't there.
There was someone.
Thanks for coming down.
Look, I don't think I can help you.
You can't keep me here.
Take it easy. Nobody's keeping you here.
Just want to ask you a few questions,
then you're free to go.
Tell me about Elizabeth Keen.
Where have you been?
Good news.
I've reconsidered our position.
Negotiations will resume immediately.
Did you talk to Denisov?
No questions.
Burke's dead, isn't he?
No. We have new evidence to present.
There is one proviso, however.
That mouthpiece from Anneca, the one you spoke to?
Bring him along.
Wait, wait. We can't leave.
Kushan's doubled the guards outside.
It's too risky.
I may need to have a chat with this Commander Kushan.
We'll come to you. See you in an hour.
We've been through this.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Well you are Samuel Aleko,
the same Samuel Aleko who was the custodian
for an abandoned vessel docked in D.C. Harbor,
a rig called the Phoenix.
Zebra mussels.
Yeah, I got to say, Sam,
I've seen guys tripped up by a lot of things,
but zebra mussels?
Yeah, that's a first.
Ah, there it is. Yeah, see?
Y-y-you -- you spoke to the shellfish inspector,
and y-you refused to let him board,
and you promised to vacate the slip.
See?
I know you were there.
You gentleman are doing a wonderful job.
Sorry. Sorry. Traffic coming into the city.
Price of progress.
This is Dean Walker from Anneca.
Who's this?
The smoking gun.
That sounded dramatic.
Leonid Zhabin.
This is the new evidence that you were talking about.
Ex-minister Zhabin hasn't been in power for 20 years,
and with all due respect, sir, the man is not mentally well.
Perhaps not,
but "In a mad world, only the mad are sane."
Kurosawa.
What the hell is he talking about?
History, Mr. Walker.
My new friend knows a great deal
about the history of your company's pipeline.
History is not new evidence.
Or maybe it is.
As it turns out, we do agree on one key detail.
Your company's current pipeline
is not the worst thing on earth.
Then what is?
The first pipeline -- the one Anneca built in 1988,
four years before the current one.
Is that what he told you? The man is delusional.
Probably.
There was only one pipeline.
We broke ground to build it in '92.
Read the contracts.
You're right. The contracts do say that.
It started before the Wall fell.
Uzbekistan was still
a constituent republic of the Soviet Union.
Mr. Gorbachev was changing our future.
I was allowed to secretly open our markets
for an American pipeline.
This is fiction.
I sold the rights to them that year,
and they built the first pipeline right away.
You couldn't even wait to do it right!
We were all so greedy.
The first line was an unmitigated disaster.
Hundreds were killed.
Whole villages became ill.
I still see their faces.
Then the Soviet Union collapsed, and all hell broke loose.
Anneca paid Mr. Zhabin to orchestrate a cover-up.
Bury the dead,
destroy any record that the first pipeline ever existed.
It wasn't the only disaster
cloaked by those momentous events,
hidden from view in the fog of a new world order.
It's a good story.
But that's all it is -- a story from a crazy old man.
Who happened to keep a complete set of the original documents
in the hope that, one day,
he might find the courage to set things right.
You engineers did better the second time around.
At least this one took 20 years to start leaking.
If this is true
and Anneca is responsible for hundreds of people's deaths,
then you and the other high-level executives will be prosecuted.
Reparations can be paid to the alleged victims.
We can fix this.
Reparations are all well and good,
but the people I represent don't want you to fix it.
They don't?
No.
The Uzbek people
have had quite enough of Anneca's promises.
They want you to leave.
Pack up your pipeline and leave.
That won't happen.
Mr. Denisov thought you might need some additional incentive,
so Mr. Zhabin was kind enough to direct him
to one of the mass graves
where victims of the first pipeline are buried.
His men are on their way there now.
I can stop them if we have a deal.
Can I get some water, please?
Oh! Yes! Of course.
This is the water they drink in the villages,
the ones directly above your pipeline.
Drink up.
Talk to your board.
You have 24 hours until we go public.
Effective immediately, Anneca Oil has elected
to cease operation of its local pipeline.
And we are thrilled to announce
some exciting and highly profitable
new initiatives on the horizon.
We got to go.
S.R.U. just confirmed -- Agent Burke's being released.
Where?
Drop point outside the city.
...Construction of three new schools
for the people of this great country.
Thank you.
And now I'll take a few questions.
Commander Kushan.
It's good to meet you.
I've heard nothing but terrible things.
What kind of deal are we talking about?
It all depends on what you got to say,
how valuable it is to the case.
I can take you to the body.
Is that valuable enough?
They should be here any time now.
Director Heyworth, the agents are on site.
Please advise.
Do not move until they take possession of the asset.
S.O.G. team is standing by in the perimeter,
awaiting your go.
Once the exchange is complete,
I want Reddington taken into custody.
If Denisov shows, kill him.
Car's arriving now, sir.
Team leader, stand by.
Can you confirm Reddington is in the vehicle?
Affirmative.
Agent Burke. Welcome back.
We have eyes on target.
Reddington's out of the car, sir.
Nobody moves until I give the order.
Hey, Arnold.
Sir, I tried to stop him.
You and I have a problem.
Take a step back, Harold.
You ignored a Justice Department directive.
You told Kushan how to find that compound.
You can't prove that.
You and I both know
my people are there to protect an asset of yours.
I can neither confirm nor deny.
If anything happens
to those agents,
the next time your phone rings,
it'll be the Attorney General calling.
Sir, standing by for your order.
Sir, our window's closing.
Requesting authorization to take immediate action.
Stand down.
I need your help.
Commander Kushan and his men are at my compound.
His men are.
If you can get me out of the country --
I can.
But I won't.
They will arrest me.
Perhaps.
Sooner or later, we all must pay for our crimes.
Is Kushan...
You still don't see it, do you?
The endgame.
You could run this country, Ruslan.
What you've done is that important.
You brought a multinational corporation to its knees,
saved countless lives.
You'll make this country billions.
You may go to prison for a bit.
But you will emerge a hero.
One of the few standing in your way
is Commander Kushan.
Well, not standing.
Commander Kushan?
More on this breaking story.
Just hours after Anneca Oil's announcement
that the company is shutting down its pipeline
comes this surprising development.
The government and French Oil conglomerate Savillion
have reached a deal
to nationalize a brand-new pipeline.
The deal, said to be worth billions,
should gain easy approval
and will be finalized within days.
I never saw it coming.
I knew you had to have an angle.
Elizabeth Keen, this is Claude Hippeau,
senior vice president of Savillion.
Enchantée.
You were having drinks together the day we arrived.
You knew exactly what was gonna happen.
I had an inkling.
Au revoir, mon ami.
Give my regards to the wife -- and the mistress.
That's why you wanted Anneca to abandon the pipeline,
to clear the way for another company to get the contract?
You say that as if it's a bad thing.
Anneca shuts down operations,
the victims are well compensated,
maybe get a little justice,
a new firm is poised to deliver
a state-of-the-art pipeline -- everybody wins.
You get a payday from Savillion for making it happen.
Vive la France.
Did you find anything?
No.
I mean, uh, yes.
Looks like some kind of beta technology.
A recording device.
I'm thinking it's late '80s, early '90s.
But how it works, what it does...
I don't have the faintest idea.
Have you spoken to Mr. Reddington about this?
No.
But he might have some insights.
You have to tell me -- promise me
you will not talk to Reddington about this.
Mum's the word.
We got a deal, right?
No jail time if I testify?
You're not gonna believe
what I have to say.
Tell me about Elizabeth Keen.
