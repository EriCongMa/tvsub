critical hit . he couldn &apos;t have gone far .
he wouldn &apos;t go to a hospital .
the bleeder works for kirk .
he &apos;ll know where to find them .
i have a location .
i was trying to help . he has to know that .
i &apos;m not on your side here , kate .
i need to speak with the patient .
he &apos;s gone .
as you well know , one of the keys to my success
is a clear and consistent understanding
of my own limitations .
so often people overestimate themselves ,
misapply their gifts .
the cleaner suddenly fancies herself the strategist .
wisdom is learning the boundaries
of one &apos;s designated lane .
for instance , this , i will do poorly .
clumsily , with more mess than necessary .
it &apos;ll take longer
and be considerably more unpleasant to boot .
but i can &apos;t very well have you do it , can i ?
raymond reddington , my favorite rubio .
my god , i haven &apos;t seen you since you snuck off at carnival .
red , jesus .
what &apos;s wrong with you ?
we &apos;re looking for a name .
take a close look , manny .
he worked for a man who abducted someone i care about .
he &apos;s a cop .
who &apos;s his rabbi ?
i don &apos;t know , but i know who might .
is it true ? she &apos;s alive ?
apparently .
wait , wait . wait , wait , wait , wait , wait .
how is that ... there were complications during labor .
and the doctor , he declared her dead .
he lied .
but there was a funeral . i @-@ i was a pallbearer .
yes , and who knows what was in that casket ?
it was a charade , aram .
so agent keen is alive ?
but her funeral and her death ...
she faked her death . why would she do that ?
to get away from reddington .
so that her and tom and agnes
could have a normal life .
away from us ?
yes , after everything we did for her .
best we could tell ,
liz and tom &apos;s plan was to go into hiding in cuba .
alexander kirk found them .
why ? what does he want with agent keen ?
look , all we know right now is that
when reddington got there , liz and tom were gone .
i just got off the phone with the embassy in havana .
briefed them on kirk , gave them the tail number to his plane .
if that was how he was planning to get off the island ,
that &apos;s not gonna happen .
and , uh , what about agnes ?
at this point , we don &apos;t know .
notify fbi headquarters .
elizabeth keen is alive .
the plane is ready .
mato and the baby ?
not yet .
notify me as soon as they &apos;re here .
my baby .
she &apos;s on her way .
that &apos;s what you said before .
masha ...
my name is elizabeth .
i understand that you have questions , that you &apos;re upset .
i &apos;m sorry it has to be like this .
you &apos;re not my father .
well , i am , masha . i am .
and i intend to prove that to you .
agnes will be brought here ,
but the person doing that has a job to do first .
what job ? with tom ?
what are you doing to tom ?
let me out !
there &apos;s nothing more depressing than a failed communist state .
it doesn &apos;t even really pay to be corrupt .
when dirty cops play poker in america ,
they &apos;re able to play for real money .
let &apos;s raise the stakes .
a new game .
you tell me who the head worked for ,
you keep the money , a 5 @-@ way split .
we &apos;re keeping the money .
a young woman and her child were taken .
a russian has entered the country .
i have it on good authority
your friend here was assisting him .
i think it &apos;s time for you to leave .
make that a 4 @-@ way split .
i &apos;ll give you a name .
well , isn &apos;t this your lucky day ?
the head worked for a jhosep balzan ?
i &apos;ve never heard of him .
yeah , he &apos;s a supplier of all manner of contraband on the island .
if the people you &apos;re looking for are still in cuba ,
balzan is protecting them .
should i assemble a team ?
dembe , call silvio in san cristóbal .
tell him to put a team together . we &apos;re going after elizabeth .
第四季第一集
第79号
here .
you think i &apos;d drug you ?
you kidnapped my infant daughter ,
my husband , and me .
i &apos;d say you &apos;re capable of anything .
listen ...
you were my entire life .
you were all your mother and i ever cared about .
now you don &apos;t know any of that
because reddington took you away from us
when you were just a little girl .
he and your mother had an affair .
for a time , i thought maybe he was the father ,
but i have proof that he &apos;s not .
he &apos;s just a spiteful , evil man .
couldn &apos;t accept it when katarina broke off the affair .
one day i came home , and you were gone .
he &apos;d taken you .
i never thought i &apos;d ever see you again ...
until there you were in the news ,
you ... and reddington ,
the most wanted fugitives in the world .
if you cared so much about me ,
you wouldn &apos;t hold me hostage .
he &apos;d taken my beautiful child and turned her into a criminal .
attack my wedding , everyone i love .
everything i did was to get my child away from reddington .
who understands that more than you ?
you did the exact same thing ,
faked your own death to get your child away from him .
we have a problem .
the pnr have surrounded the plane .
then find another plane .
agnes will be here shortly .
and tom ?
hey , they have my baby ! please !
keen , you breathe a word ,
i &apos;m gonna fire two bullets --
one in the cop
and the other between the eyes of that screaming kid .
you got it ?
he &apos;s got a gun !
no , don &apos;t -- please !
where are we on kirk ?
pnr grounded his plane .
there &apos;s no sign of him or keen .
i informed the bureau
that elizabeth keen has risen from the dead .
they said three hail mary &apos;s
and they &apos;re on the lookout for the zombie apocalypse .
i understand . you feel played .
don &apos;t you , sir ?
look , we should be halfway to havana by now .
why ? she obviously doesn &apos;t want our help .
maybe or maybe not , but she needs it .
you &apos;re willing to risk your life after what she did ?
all right , let &apos;s just have this conversation .
keen lied to us , took advantage of all of us ,
and no one is more upset about that than i.
or ... relieved .
truth be told , i didn &apos;t think it was possible
to be this joyous and livid at the same time .
but i have a job to do --
find keen and her family
and bring them home safely .
and i know that no matter how i feel ,
i can do that job .
i need to know if each of you can say the same .
hello , raymond .
elizabeth , are you okay ?
of course she is .
unlike you , i would never hurt my own daughter .
elizabeth ?
elizabeth .
? i &apos;m on your left .
constantin .
what do you want ? name it .
you bring her out unharmed , you &apos;ll have it .
of course , the concierge of crime wants to cut a deal .
you &apos;ll give me whatever i want ?
yes .
in exchange for masha ?
whatever you desire .
what i desire is to raise my child ,
to watch her grow ,
and to have back the 26 years of being a father
that you took from me .
but you can &apos;t give me that , can you ?
no , she was never yours to raise .
patrol unit incoming .
military patrol . armored military .
agnes . do you have agnes ?
i don &apos;t have her .
go . find agnes and tom .
i &apos;m not leaving here without you .
you just don &apos;t get it , do you , raymond ?
she doesn &apos;t want to be with you .
that &apos;s why she faked her own death --
to get away from you .
raymond , we have to go now .
if they get you , they &apos;ll kill you .
raymond .
did you hear me ? you have to go .
go !
elizabeth , i will come for you .
harold , gather your team .
reddington . where are you ?
tell me you have agent keen .
no , but she &apos;s still on the island .
kirk &apos;s preparing her exit plan .
i don &apos;t know what the preparations are ,
but i know who can find out -- manuel esteban .
the chilean spymaster ?
who &apos;s esteban ?
our next blacklister .
manuel orentez esteban .
leader of pinochet &apos;s caravan of death
that institutionalized
a state @-@ sponsored system of terror
through abuse , abduction , and murder .
according to our database , he died in 1989 .
except he didn &apos;t .
esteban is alive and well and a legendary enforcer
for a series of authoritarian regimes .
assuming what you say is true and esteban is alive ,
what makes you think he can help locate keen ?
kirk &apos;s man in cuba is protected by the military .
if the military is involved , esteban will know about it .
we &apos;ll never find esteban in time .
we have no assets in cuba .
of course you do , harold .
esteban . he works for your government .
castro took him in , and the cia immediately
put him on the payroll as a double agent .
what little you know
about the inner workings of the cuban government
is courtesy of manuel esteban .
the cia knows where to find him ,
and he knows where to find elizabeth .
what are you talking to reddington for ?
i thought your task force
was disbanded after agent keen &apos;s death .
it turns out she &apos;s not dead . she &apos;s been kidnapped .
and if we have any hope for finding her ,
it rests in finding esteban .
i need to know where to find him .
i hate getting into bed with reddington .
i ... hate needing him
and his list .
if you find agent keen ,
will he continue to give you names ?
he just did -- esteban .
according to him , esteban works for the agency .
good lord .
is there anything that man doesn &apos;t know ?
how can we contact him ?
the agency reaches out to him
through the state department &apos;s weekly travel advisory .
set a meeting , a message is encoded in the advisory ,
detailing where and when .
the meeting is set for the national museum .
you &apos;ll be going to cuba undercover , as tourists .
he &apos;ll be going . not me .
you may be fine with doing this job , no matter how you feel .
i can &apos;t .
how you feel ?
how about how keen feels ?
forget about what she did
and try to figure out why she did it .
i have , and someday , maybe i &apos;ll be okay with it .
but right now i &apos;m not .
what ? you &apos;re okay with this ?
no .
but for now , i accept it .
you &apos;ll be going alone . here &apos;s how it &apos;s gonna work .
your agent will be detailed
with the dallas / fort worth arts and cultural committee .
esteban will expect to meet at the café aventura
across from the national museum .
once inside , take a table in the back , order an egg coffee .
i appreciate you burning a source for this .
you knowing he exists is the least of esteban &apos;s problems .
now that we &apos;re all chummy with the cubanos ,
his relationship with the agency is , uh ,
something of a liability .
you &apos;re gonna scrub him ?
let &apos;s just say , if you wanna reach out to esteban ,
you should do it quickly .
jesus . hot as balls in here .
you guys actually drink this stuff ?
kill him first . come back for the cop .
meet you at that place .
get out of the car ! get out of the car !
romina .
move it . hey .
let her go .
look , you can take me , all right ?
do whatever you want . just give me my little girl !
hey ! i &apos;m begging you ! give me my little girl !
please !
you and i are gonna have some fun , man .
don &apos;t talk . they &apos;ll kill us .
where are we ?
how many people does he have down there ?
my family . they have a way out .
he wants me to tell him how .
he &apos;s going to kill me .
i &apos;ve seen his face . anyone who sees --
it &apos;s him .
right . upright .
so the rumors are true .
they sent you to finish me .
not quite , no .
the americans want me dead ,
so our relationship dies with me ,
so i get embarrassed .
look , i &apos;m not here to kill you , pal ,
i &apos;m here to tell you that
raymond reddington wants to see you .
oh , so now the u.s. government is reddington &apos;s messenger .
oh , you know how it works .
the american government has deals
with all kinds of scumbags .
look , i &apos;ll tell you how it works .
you &apos;re gonna give me your phone .
i &apos;m gonna dial a number .
okay , cowboy .
i like this one .
reddington ?
manuel esteban .
my heavens , you &apos;re a devil to get ahold of .
i &apos;m surprised we &apos;ve never met .
i &apos;d like to have a little chitchat .
how would you feel about a blind date ?
i &apos;m looking for a woman .
aren &apos;t we all ?
her name is elizabeth keen ,
and the man holding her has the protection of the far .
they know where she is ,
which means you know where she is ,
or you could certainly find out .
why would i help you ? you &apos;re an anarchist .
probably .
maybe more of an opportunist .
and i have the opportunity to help you .
you spent a lifetime bouncing
from one authoritarian regime to the next .
but this is the last stop .
you &apos;re a relic .
the détente between america and cuba
makes you a man without a country .
sooner or later , both sides will want you dead .
my money &apos;s on sooner .
i can take care of myself .
clicking like a hairless fruit bat is impressive , manuel ,
but you and i both know avoiding a lamppost
is very different from avoiding an assassin &apos;s bullet .
echo location can &apos;t help you with that , but i can .
what do you propose ?
i know what it &apos;s like to be hunted .
i &apos;ve protected myself for 30 years .
and i can protect you ...
after you locate elizabeth keen .
all right , listen to me , please .
the baby -- i can pay you .
quiet .
not me . i have a friend .
whatever you want , he &apos;ll help you .
we &apos;ll get you off the island , he &apos;ll protect you .
i said quiet , man .
look , just let her go !
all right , you can kill me . i don &apos;t care .
just let my baby go .
let &apos;s go and dig .
i know you don &apos;t want to talk to me . fine .
then listen .
it was excruciating
to watch you mourn elizabeth &apos;s death ,
to know that i was making you endure that .
yes , i betrayed you ,
but only after you had betrayed her .
raymond , you have to change .
i took elizabeth from you ,
and now i need your help to get her back .
but when you do ,
as i &apos;m sure you will ,
you have to let her go .
why don &apos;t you wait in the car ?
i have a location for the girl .
and the child ?
i asked , but people know nothing about a child .
tell me about the location .
it is heavily protected .
20 , maybe more .
i &apos;ll need more men .
that won &apos;t be necessary .
i have a blood disorder .
good .
i &apos;m dying .
even better .
they &apos;re here .
oh , baby . are you okay , sweetheart ?
let me look at you .
oh , you &apos;re okay .
oh , my god .
it &apos;s okay . you &apos;re a strong girl .
everything &apos;s gonna be okay . you &apos;re with mommy now . shh .
she &apos;s beautiful .
yes ? yes , it &apos;s good to hear from you .
you disappoint me , balzan .
yes , yes , of ... course .
it &apos;s the pilot .
everything is on schedule . i &apos;ll notify the men .
i assume the husband &apos;s been taken care of .
is it done ?
what &apos;s taking so long ?
angel .
angel ?
angel .
he wants to talk to you .
hello . who &apos;s this ?
all that matters is that you have a little girl ,
and you have her mother .
tom .
i &apos;m coming for them ,
for you .
and not just me , an army .
you hear me ?
an army is coming for you .
you lost tom .
we &apos;ll be going soon .
where ?
home .
i &apos;m not going anywhere with you .
i faked my death to have a normal life .
there &apos;s nothing normal about being held prisoner .
a temporary inconvenience .
you &apos;ll see in time that the normal life you want ,
i &apos;m the only one who can give that to you .
she &apos;s hungry , which means i need to feed her ,
which means you need to leave .
of course .
i &apos;ve done what i can , but you must hurry .
kirk has chartered a float plane .
there isn &apos;t much time .
for either of us .
a stevedore will meet you on pier 36 .
i &apos;ve arranged for a berth
on a container ship bound for caracas .
adios .
we have an eta on that plane ?
your job here is done , donald .
like hell it is .
i came here to get keen . i &apos;m not leaving without her .
you think i &apos;m gonna let you tag along so you can inform
the people who kidnapped elizabeth
they have the right to remain silent ?
i appreciate your assistance ,
but i &apos;m not interested in having an ethical debate with you
about whether they have the right to consult
with an attorney before i put a bullet in their head .
excuse me .
what about that dirtball ? i suppose you think , uh ,
i should be okay with letting him walk .
it &apos;s entirely up to you .
you made a deal with him .
yes , in order to save elizabeth ,
i made a deal with the devil of the day .
i did . you didn &apos;t .
if you have a problem with that ,
you &apos;ve got 12 hours before his ship leaves
to do something about it .
otherwise , safe travels home , donald .
elizabeth ?
ready to go ?
balzan !
balzan !
he &apos;s gone . your guards , your security , they &apos;re all gone .
the child and the girl -- find them .
this is agent mojtabi .
aram , it &apos;s tom .
tom ? hey . tell me you &apos;re with agent keen .
the man who took agnes --
he &apos;s driving a blue dodge sedan , late &apos; 50s .
he &apos;s taking her straight to liz .
if we can follow the car ...
we can find them . okay , let me think . let me think .
okay , what i &apos;m thinking is , um ,
did you help agent keen fake her death ?
aram !
not helpful , i know . okay . but did you ?
at the funeral , when you put a flower on her casket --
the car -- it has an old tube radio .
local oscillator .
the oscillator . right . of course .
okay , if you could rewire it ,
you might be able to turn the pll receiver into this --
into a low power mono fm transmitter
that produces a signal that you can trace . yeah . i know .
you do ? then , uh , why are you ...
to get you to trace the signal , aram .
oh . oh , you already ... uh ...
wow , that &apos;s , uh , that is impressive .
okay . hang on . i &apos;m on it .
thank you .
did you know ?
at the christening ,
when you made me a godfather to agnes --
look , man , i know you &apos;re upset , all right ?
but right now is not the time .
i &apos;m trying to ping the signal . waiting for a reply ...
from both of you .
aram ...
of course i knew .
i &apos;ll let you know when , uh , i find the signal .
thank you .
shh , shh , shh .
shh . shh .
please , agnes , stop crying . mommy &apos;s here .
shh , shh , shh .
think about what you &apos;re doing .
what are you gonna do ? hurt me ?
hurt my baby ?
kirk will kill you if you do .
are you a mother ? do you have children ?
look at her ...
no !
little mama , you got spirit .
get up . get the baby .
you &apos;ll learn to trust me .
get the baby and the things . we &apos;re leaving .
like hell we are .
no !
i wish there was another way , i do ,
but reddington &apos;s on his way .
agnes !
come on . get her onboard .
yeah .
mr. reddington . it &apos;s aram .
it &apos;s not a good time .
i have information on agent keen . a location .
she &apos;s being held near this --
a small fishing port in playa larga .
we &apos;re on our way .
magic . how &apos;d you do that ?
we &apos;ll have elizabeth shortly .
and agnes .
agnes ?
right . tom called .
thanks to him , i was able to track the vehicle
where he had last seen agnes , a blue dodge sedan .
thank you , aram .
agnes is here .
luis , you and your men take
the perimeters to the north and the west .
dembe , secure the house .
silvio , you &apos;re with me to the south .
you stay put .
that &apos;s not your child .
they &apos;re gone .
i &apos;m sorry , raymond .
we have her .
you told them he worked for us ?
do you have any idea
what kind of blowback i &apos;m dealing with here ?
and it doesn &apos;t take long to find out who told the cubans .
i heard it was an anonymous tip .
agent ressler ...
are you a traitor or -- or just a moron ?
look , the agency was gonna assassinate esteban ...
i have no direct knowledge --
so the cubans wouldn &apos;t find out
who was feeding secrets to the cia .
whoever this anonymous source is ,
he just saved a lot of lives .
what are you talking about ?
now that america knows about
esteban &apos;s little torture chamber ,
the cubans are going to want plausible deniability .
let &apos;s not mince words .
you took it upon yourself to tell the cubans about our --
no , i took it upon myself to stop what esteban was doing .
do you have any idea what that was ?
no , of course you don &apos;t ,
because all you care about is what esteban was doing for you
there are bigger issues , agent ressler .
torture , abuse , murder .
i don &apos;t see any bigger issues than that .
excuse me .
have you heard from reddington ?
no .
uh , last time i spoke to him ,
he was on his way to the location
where agent keen was being held .
i &apos;m sure he &apos;ll call . i &apos;m sure they &apos;re okay .
i think you were wrong not going to cuba .
i &apos;m not saying what agent keen did was right ,
but as long as her life is in danger ,
as long as agnes &apos;s life is in danger ,
i think we have to put our feelings aside .
what &apos;s happening to liz is her own fault .
i know that sounds harsh , but it &apos;s true .
she made decisions that have consequences ,
and now she has to live with them .
she &apos;s in trouble .
i know , and i &apos;m angry about that .
because if she &apos;d behaved differently ,
she wouldn &apos;t be in this position .
but she is . and no matter how we feel ,
i think we have to do something about it .
i don &apos;t .
if you don &apos;t help ,
and something happens to agent keen or agnes ,
i know you .
you won &apos;t be able to live with yourself .
yes ?
it &apos;s tom .
tell him we were too late .
kirk has elizabeth .
what about agnes ?
she &apos;s with us . safe .
your daughter is safe .
raymond , i &apos;ve been thinking about where we go from here --
