wouldn &apos;t it be cool if our duck and our chick had a baby ?
we could call it chuck .
or dick .
listen , i need a favor .
i was in the shower , and as i was ...
... cleansing myself , i felt something .
was it like a sneeze , only better ?
no . i mean , like , a thing on my body .
well , what was it ?
well , i don &apos;t know . it &apos;s kind of in a place that &apos;s not ....
it &apos;s not visually accessible to me . and i was hoping maybe you guys ...
... could help me out .
come on , you guys ! it &apos;s no big deal !
well , what is it ? is it a mole ?
no , it &apos;s too wrinkly to be a mole .
is it ? what , a pimple ?
no , it &apos;s ...
... fancier than a pimple .
ross , just go see a doc
guys , what &apos;s ?
well , it &apos;s definite . two more weeks of winter .
yeah , right .
the one with ross &apos; thing
and this is the coffeehouse . this is where i play my music .
good deal .
these are my friends .
people ? this is vince . vince , the people .
vince is a fireman .
have you ever rescued anyone from a burning building ?
ninety @-@ eight hot saves . highest on the force .
if joey and i play with matches , we could get you up to an even 100 .
fire safety is not a joke , son .
you &apos;re right . i know .
look , i gotta go . i &apos;m on call tonight .
see you saturday .
he &apos;s cute , pheebs .
but you just started dating that teacher .
oh , jason ?
we &apos;re seeing each other tonight .
well , pheebs ?
two dates in one day ? that &apos;s so unlike you .
i know , i know . i &apos;m , like , playing the field .
i &apos;m juggling two guys . i &apos;m sowing my wild oats .
you know , this kind of , like , oat @-@ sowing , field @-@ playing juggler .
so do they know about each other ?
does a dog &apos;s lips move when he reads ?
okay , no , they don &apos;t know .
hey , guys .
well ?
how &apos;d it go at the doctor &apos;s ?
he said there &apos;s definitely nothing to worry about . it &apos;s benign .
what is it ?
he couldn &apos;t even tell me .
he said it was just some sort of &quot; skin abnormality . &quot;
so it &apos;s just skin .
well , no . he said it &apos;s skinlike .
okay . so it &apos;s not skin .
well , it &apos;s in the skin family .
the worse thing is , he said , being unable to identify it ...
... he was reluctant to remove it .
you should go to my guy .
because when i went in there with my third nipple ...
... he just lopped it right off .
so i guess i &apos;m lucky .
i mean , not as lucky as people who are born with two nipples .
at least they knew what yours was . you know ? yours had a name .
maybe they &apos;ll name yours after you .
you know ? they &apos;d call it &quot; the ross . &quot;
and then people would be , like , &quot; oh , he &apos;s got a ross . &quot;
yeah , that &apos;d be cool .
pete &apos;s breaking up with me .
what ?
i just checked my messages .
he said that when he gets back , &quot; we need to talk . &quot;
and ?
well , that &apos;s it .
people never say , &quot; we need to talk , &quot; unless it &apos;s something bad .
that doesn &apos;t necessarily mean he &apos;s breaking up with you .
really ?
maybe he just cheated on you .
i won &apos;t get rich doing it , but i gotta say , it &apos;s cool ...
... knowing you &apos;re making a difference in a kid &apos;s life .
that is so great .
oh , my god !
oh , my god !
we &apos;d better call the fire department .
well , we don &apos;t need a fireman .
we need , like , a good mechanic .
what ?
lt &apos;s probably just low on coolant .
oh , my god ! here they come ! we gotta get out of here !
wait . why ?
if i wanted to see a fireman , i &apos;d date one .
that &apos;s all it is . a third nipple .
you know ? just your run @-@ of @-@ the @-@ mill third nipple .
you can take it off . just slice that baby right off .
take your shirt off . let &apos;s see what we &apos;re dealing with .
what are you doing ?
just showing you my run @-@ of @-@ the @-@ mill , slice @-@ it @-@ right @-@ off third nipple .
well , that &apos;s not a third nipple .
first of all , it &apos;s on your ass .
well , then what is it ?
wait a minute . hold it .
jansen , come in here .
i &apos;m with hamilton !
he &apos;s good with weird things . bring him in too .
you know what you don &apos;t see a lot ? topless tap dancing .
l really enjoy these little talks we have .
i gotta go water pete &apos;s plants .
you know what ? if he &apos;s gonna break up with me , maybe i won &apos;t water them .
if he &apos;s gonna break up with you , maybe joey and i should do it ...
... if you know what i mean .
or ...
... we could go and pee on them .
i can &apos;t take it , you know .
i &apos;m afraid one of them will catch me with the other .
it &apos;s making me crazy !
why don &apos;t you break up with one of them ?
what happened to playing the field ?
it doesn &apos;t feel like playing anymore .
it &apos;s feels like work . it &apos;s like i &apos;m working in the field .
so pick one of them .
which one do you like more ?
vince is great , you know ? because he &apos;s , like , a &quot; guy &quot; guy .
he &apos;s just so burly , so very burly .
okay , good . so there you go . go with vince .
but jason &apos;s really sensitive .
sensitive is important . pick him .
oh , sure . go with the sissy .
jason is not a sissy .
i meant chandler .
you know , i have dinner plans .
thank you so much for coming on such a short notice .
ladies and gentlemen , i &apos;ve been practicing medicine for 23 years ...
... and i &apos;m stumped .
okay , this is the den .
all right , check this out . lights !
all right , less lights ! bad lights !
lights , go away !
see ? you just need the right command .
and the dimmer switch .
for a rich guy , that &apos;s a small tv .
that &apos;s the video phone .
but you shouldn &apos;t be here . so don &apos;t touch anything .
ikea , this is comfortable !
this place is amazing !
oh , god ! that &apos;s the nicest kitchen .
i know .
it &apos;s the nicest kitchen .
the refrigerator told me to have a great day .
look , a millionaire &apos;s checkbook .
joey , put that down .
oh , my god , that &apos;s pete . get out !
how the hell do you answer a video phone ?
i guess that &apos;s how .
monica , how &apos;s it going ?
oh , it &apos;s good . it &apos;s good .
just here , watering the plants .
don &apos;t forget that ficus there by rachel .
chandler &apos;s on the couch !
i see him . you guys are the worst hiders , ever .
hi .
how you doing ?
the other day when you said you needed to talk ...
... just so i know , is it good news or bad news ?
it &apos;s good news . it &apos;s definitely good news .
hold on a second , i have another call .
how &apos;s it going ?
it &apos;s still me .
i &apos;ve got picture @-@ in @-@ picture here .
i &apos;m gonna have to call you back later .
monica ? you . i &apos;m gonna have to call you back .
so i &apos;ll see you soon .
okay . i love you .
i love you .
we love you too !
well , it &apos;s good news . it &apos;s good news .
what do you think the good news is ?
look at this !
he wrote a check for $ 50,000 to &quot; hugo lindgren &apos;s ring design . &quot;
sorry . what do you think the good news is ?
oh , my !
monica &apos;s gonna marry a millionaire !
you gotta get mom on the phone ! call mom ! call mom !
and that &apos;s pete &apos;s mom .
you have to make it a theme wedding . and the theme could be :
&quot; look how much money we &apos;ve got ! &quot;
i mean , you could put money in the invitations .
you could have , like , little @-@ money place settings .
and you could start with a money salad .
i mean , it &apos;ll be dry , but people will like it .
would you stop ?
we &apos;ve only gone out a couple of weeks .
we don &apos;t know if he &apos;ll propose .
but this is pete . he &apos;s not like other people .
on your first date , you went to rome .
for most guys , that &apos;s like a third or fourth date kind of thing .
well , if that &apos;s what it is , then it &apos;s crazy .
monica &apos;s right . we &apos;re talking about marriage here .
she can &apos;t just rush into this .
what do you know ? you married a lesbian !
you could do worse monica.he &apos;s a really good guy .
you know what you should do ? don &apos;t decide now .
wait until you &apos;re in the moment and whatever you feel will be the answer .
pete gets down on his knee and pulls out that pumpkin @-@ sized diamond ring ....
i gotta go . i have to break up with vince .
so you &apos;re going with the teacher ?
i like vince a lot , you know ? but jason is so sensitive .
in the long run , i think sensitive is better than having ...
... a really , really , really nice body .
jason . definitely jason .
wish me luck !
good luck !
oh , my god !
sorry .
i was imagining what it &apos;d be like to catch the money bouquet .
excuse me . is vince here ?
oh , sure .
i didn &apos;t know you guys actually used those .
so what &apos;s up ?
this isn &apos;t gonna be easy .
i don &apos;t think we should see each other anymore .
good deal .
i &apos;m sorry .
no , it &apos;s okay .
it &apos;s just that i thought we had something pretty special here .
i felt like you were someone i could finally open up to .
there &apos;s so much in me i haven &apos;t shared with you yet .
my god ! i didn &apos;t know you were so
i &apos;m sorry . i can &apos;t talk .
i &apos;m gonna go write in my journal .
wait ! wait ! wait !
if you wanna take care of that thing , go see my herbal guy .
thanks . but i wanna remove it , not make it savory .
when girls sleep with guys with weird things on their body ...
... they tell their friends about it .
give me that .
okay , don &apos;t be mad at me , but i couldn &apos;t resist .
bride &apos;s magazines ?
i know you said you &apos;d say no if he asked you ...
... but how great would you look walking down the aisle ...
... in this donna karan ?
you so would !
you should get that anyway .
well , for clubbing .
it is so weird .
i know what i said . but this morning ...
... i was lying in bed , imagining what it &apos;d be like to say yes .
i know it &apos;s a little sudden , and it &apos;s rushed ...
... and it &apos;s not like me to do something like this .
but it doesn &apos;t mean i can &apos;t . right ?
i mean , i &apos;m crazy about pete .
and i know that we want the same things .
and when i thought about saying yes ...
... it made me really happy .
oh , my god !
i know .
i need more pie .
mon , if you do get married , can i bring two guests ?
you didn &apos;t break up with that fireman ?
that was my way of telling you .
well , it turns out he &apos;s incredibly sensitive .
he keeps a journal and he paints .
he even showed me charcoal drawings that he drew of me .
he &apos;d prefer watercolors , but he has easy access to a lot of charcoal .
so will you dump jason ?
yeah , because i have to break up with someone .
so jason is sensitive . but now , so is vince .
plus , vince has the body . you know ?
so ....
it &apos;s really just about the math .
come on in .
you sounded serious on the phone .
is anything wrong ?
you must be ross .
i am guru saj .
listen , i gotta tell you , i &apos;ve never been to a guru before , so ....
well , relax .
if it makes you feel any better , i &apos;ve attended ...
... fine medical schools in central america .
well , let &apos;s take a look at this skin abnormality of yours .
come on , have a seat .
as i suspected , it &apos;s a kundus .
what &apos;s a &quot; kundus &quot; ?
i don &apos;t know . what &apos;s a kundus with you ?
please lie down .
i &apos;ve got a salve that ought to shrink that right up .
i guess it &apos;s worth a try .
sure . we should see results
clearly not the way to go !
what ? what ?
we appear to have angered it .
we ? we angered it ?
i think i see the problem .
and i &apos;m afraid we &apos;re gonna have to use a much stronger tool .
love .
oh , god !
often these things are nothing more than negative energy ...
... trying to escape your body .
now. this is not gonna come off unless you learn to love it , my friend .
so let me hear you say , you will love the kundus .
l love the kundus .
there is absolutely no way this is gonna come off ...
... unless you start to ....
what was that ?
well , it &apos;s gone .
how &apos;s that ?
got caught in my watch .
lights .
romantic lights .
nice .
so there was this thing i wanted to talk to you about .
oh , right . i &apos;d completely forgot about that .
i &apos;ve been doing a lot of thinking .
and i look at my life ...
... and i feel like i &apos;ve conquered the business world .
and i feel like i &apos;ve conquered the intellectual world .
and now i have the most beautiful woman in the world .
but there &apos;s one thing missing .
what &apos;s that ?
it &apos;s time for me to conquer the physical world .
i wanna become ...
... the ultimate fighting champion .
you wanna what ?
i wanna be the ultimate fighting champion .
it &apos;s the most intense physical competition in the world .
it &apos;s banned in 49 states .
what are you talking about ?
my trainer , hoshi , is teaching me ...
... jeet kune do and brazilian streetfighting .
i even had my own octagon training ring designed .
and i suppose you used a ring designer for that .
i want you there , in the front row , when i win .
i want you close enough to smell the blood .
what do you think ?
my parents will be so happy .
crazy underwear creeping up my butt
crazy underwear always in a rut
crazy underwear
what is he doing here ?
all right , just keep playing .
you &apos;ll get through this . you &apos;ll be fine .
okay , thank you .
and as always , no one talk to me after the show .
i was passing by and saw you were playing .
this is cool , seeing you up there .
what &apos;s going on here ? who &apos;s this guy ?
i don &apos;t know ! he just started kissing me . get him , vince !
what ?
i &apos;ve been dating both of you .
and it &apos;s been really horrible , because it &apos;s been ...
... a lot of fun for me .
but i like you both ...
... and i didn &apos;t know how to choose .
so i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m terrible . i &apos;m a terrible person .
relax . it &apos;s okay . i mean ....
we never said this was exclusive .
neither did we . so give yourself a break .
really ?
we haven &apos;t been going out that long .
come on , we haven &apos;t even slept together yet .
you haven &apos;t ?
you have ?
well , this is none of my business .
i can &apos;t believe this ! you slept with him ?
well , i made you a candlelight dinner in the park .
i &apos;m gonna make this real easy for you .
that could &apos;ve been really awkward .
you made him a candlelight dinner in the park ?
yeah , but i can do that for you . i &apos;m gonna do that for you .
i can &apos;t believe i went out with somebody ...
... who &apos;d have an open flame in the middle of a wooded area !
everything &apos;s gonna be all right .
okay , dick ?
hello . i am guru saj .
he &apos;s a duck , right ? because otherwise ...
... this is way out of my league .
he &apos;s got a really bad cough , and our vet can &apos;t stop it .
is there something you can do ?
let me see .
let me see .
