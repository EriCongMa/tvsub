all right , i saved the best for last .
organized crime is asking us to keep an eye out
for any financial movement from the motor city .
apparently , the detroit mob &apos;s in town .
this guy , frank de luca ,
has been spotted poking around our local criminal hot spots .
organized crime thinks that he &apos;s looking for somebody .
do they know who ?
no , but last night , this numbers runner
met with an unfortunate accident
after somebody tried getting information out of him .
o.c. suspects it was de luca doing the asking .
we got al capone on tax evasion .
maybe there &apos;s a financial angle that we can play de luca .
that &apos;s it . meeting adjourned .
sounds like we &apos;ve got an easy day .
we do . please don &apos;t complicate it .
i would never . can i take an early lunch ?
sure .
something wrong , boss ?
neal just complicated my day .
have organized crime get those files on the detroit mob .
you got it .
okay , you degenerates , listen up .
there are great opportunities here .
we &apos;ve got ultrasonic stun @-@ gun binoculars ,
cane swords , cattle prods , morning @-@ star maces .
this iron do anything ?
oh , you ever need a multi @-@ directional mike
with optional tear @-@ gas dispenser valve ?
no .
who &apos;s this little guy ?
no , no , no. no , it &apos;s not for sale .
can &apos;t have that . here , uh , try this .
no , don &apos;t eat this . trust me .
moz , i need to talk to you .
not now , neal .
this is important .
did you talk to a numbers runner recently ?
uh , yeah , eddie nine @-@ ball . why ?
he &apos;s dead , moz .
hey , listen up , new york underworld .
i &apos;m frank de luca jr. from detroit ,
and i &apos;m here looking for a man
who &apos;s known as &quot; the dentist of detroit . &quot;
so you think the dentist is a myth , huh ?
no one man could do everything he &apos;s done .
well , i &apos;m here to tell you -- the dentist is real ,
and i have good reason to believe
he &apos;s right here in new york city .
and so , surely , one of you knows who the dentist is .
okay .
please ...
tell the dentist that i &apos;m making an appointment ,
and if he doesn &apos;t keep it ...
... he can say goodbye to his friend .
that &apos;s mr. jeffries .
what &apos;s going on , moz ?
neal ...
i &apos;m the dentist of detroit .
this everything from organized crime ?
including a map of de luca &apos;s
suspected movements around the city .
what do you know about him ?
de luca sr. was gunned down five months ago ,
leaving his son frank to take over the family business .
leo mazzera -- drives the car , scares the people .
we got caffrey &apos;s tracking data cued up .
what did he do now ?
took an early lunch .
yeah , remind me to stay on your good side .
you notice him perk up when peter mentioned the detroit mob ?
yeah , but we &apos;ve been tracking caffrey for seven years .
he has no detroit ties .
but mozzie does .
jones , overlay neal &apos;s tracking data with de luca &apos;s .
de luca &apos;s in red .
look at that --
neal &apos;s movements , de luca &apos;s movements .
looks like de luca found who he was looking for .
you &apos;re not meeting de luca .
i &apos;m not going alone .
i &apos;ll have this in the sky to scan the area &apos;s weak spots
while you go to a higher @-@ ground position
with your laser -- - moz !
are you actively trying to die ?
you can &apos;t take on de luca .
neal , i &apos;m on a rescue mission !
mr. jeffries is in trouble .
let &apos;s keep talking this through .
how did de luca find you ?
well , he knew i was connected to the group home .
he must have tracked my donation .
did you shore up your account ?
i had to transfer the cash immediately --
only had time to dummy back one account ,
not my usual four .
there you go .
what are you doing ?
in case it &apos;s de luca .
i &apos;m gonna stand behind you .
that &apos;s wise .
that looks remarkably like peter .
hey , guys . what you doing ?
oh , just being oppressed by the man -- the usual .
something for the crazy man who has everything ?
oh , that &apos;s sweet darnell ,
my taste @-@ tester .
you can never be too careful .
you in danger , mozzie ?
i live in danger , suit .
this wouldn &apos;t have anything to do with frank de luca , would it ?
come on , guys .
organized crime &apos;s been following de luca .
i know he was here .
he &apos;s forcing a meet with moz using an old friend as leverage .
neal .
why ? what does he want with you ?
i @-@ i &apos;m a man of many secrets , but i am going to that meeting .
absolutely not . de luca &apos;s dangerous .
i @-@ i &apos;d like to see you try and stop me .
consider yourself a protected witness .
you can &apos;t do this !
oh , i can .
what does de luca want with you ? - he wants --
don &apos;t say it , neal .
de luca wants mozzie
because he &apos;s the dentist of detroit .
neal ! et tu , brute ?
et tu ? !
i &apos;m sorry . it &apos;s to keep you safe .
mozzie is the dentist of detroit ?
i know . i &apos;m still trying to wrap my head around it .
you know , i resent your judgment
and your misguided misunderstanding
of things you do not understand ...
neal , the dentist is linked to hundreds of crimes
going over decades -- some really bad stuff .
mozzie &apos;s a lot of things , but he &apos;s not bad .
can you protect him ?
i can ...
but i can &apos;t ignore what he &apos;s done .
yeah , boss ?
diana , get me everything you can find
on the dentist of detroit .
we &apos;ve got our next case .
attica !
hunger strike !
what &apos;s going on , neal ?
it &apos;s not what you think .
he got on the bad side of the mob .
i didn &apos;t know he did it as the dentist .
i didn &apos;t .
he told me some of the story .
let him tell you , too .
i know why the caged bird sings !
how many suits do you have hiding out there ?
i ask the questions .
did you find mr. jeffries yet ?
does he even hear me ?
detroit police searched his home and office .
they didn &apos;t find much , but his car is missing .
it &apos;s a good thing , moz .
de luca probably came around asking questions ,
and mr. jeffries fled .
the dentist of detroit -- suspected mastermind
in at least three major securities frauds .
i &apos;ve also got a litany of violent crimes --
assault , battery , aggravated assault ,
assault with intent to intimidate --
page after page of this stuff .
are you the dentist ?
no comment .
neal &apos;s convinced me to hear you out
so i can decide whether or not to book you .
talk to him , moz --
if not to help yourself , then to help jeffries .
just tell him the story .
we talk about jeffries first .
fine .
start talking .
detroit , 1969 .
we just put a man on the moon ,
gas was 35 cents ,
and i was orphaned .
hey , there , little man .
isaac jeffries found me .
it &apos;s okay . it &apos;s okay .
you want your little friend ?
he was the best thing that ever happened to me .
i see his name is mozart , huh ?
you &apos;re gonna be okay .
as you can imagine ,
growing up an orphan in 1970s detroit
wasn &apos;t all gumdrops and unicorns ,
especially for a small kid with thick glasses .
don &apos;t let him get it !
throw it in the mud !
look , his eye came off .
now he needs glasses like you .
that bear was the only thing i had left of my real parents .
you &apos;re having a hard time with the other kids , aren &apos;t you ?
yeah .
well , they &apos;re intimidated
&apos;cause you &apos;re smarter , and they know it .
&quot; there is no knowledge that is not power . &quot;
you know who said that ?
unh @-@ unh .
ralph waldo emerson .
now , you strive for knowledge ,
use what you learn ,
and you &apos;ll always stay ahead of them .
mr. jeffries fixed it .
he was the one person who looked out for me .
there you are , good as new --
well , maybe with a bit more character .
character defines personality ,
and in that department ,
your cup runneth over , little man .
from that day on ,
i read everything i could get my hands on --
emerson &apos;s &quot; self @-@ reliance , &quot;
thomas pynchon &apos;s &quot; v. , &quot;
erich fromm &apos;s &quot; escape from freedom , &quot;
du picq &apos;s &quot; battle studies . &quot;
i took jeffries &apos; advice
and used that knowledge to fight my own wars .
seriously , i don &apos;t have any money for you , billy .
try kenny nusbaum .
i saw him stealing a $ 20 out of locker 9 .
oh , wait .
locker 9 &apos;s yours , isn &apos;t it , biily ?
let go of my hair !
or you &apos;ll do what ?
those with no eyes to read readily
are doomed to the worst errors ...
to paraphrase du picq .
i didn &apos;t take your money !
jeffries saved me .
he gave me a life , and he told me how to live it .
do you have any idea where he might be ?
well , we exchanged secret messages over the years ,
but ...
wait , when they searched his house ,
did they find any stuffed animals ?
yeah .
yeah , they , uh -- the cops thought it was odd
until they realized he worked at a group home .
right here -- elephant , tiger , bear .
the -- the bear !
the bear is me .
it was holding an apple .
that was a clue , the big apple .
he &apos;s coming here to warn me .
you &apos;re ... sure about that ?
i think i am .
the fbi will find jeffries ,
and we &apos;ll put him under protection .
what if they find him first ?
i have to go to de luca &apos;s meeting .
no , mozzie , de luca may have already killed one man .
we don &apos;t want to add you to that list .
they don &apos;t know what the dentist looks like .
i could go in mozzie &apos;s place .
neal ...
you &apos;ll never pass as the dentist .
i could be his assistant .
this isn &apos;t your fight .
no , it &apos;s not .
but you are my friend .
stay put .
north sniper team set .
ground unit moving into position .
south sniper team set .
all right , snipers are in position .
we have jones standing by with s.w.a.t.
you &apos;ll be transmitting through this .
any problems , mozzie &apos;s waiting by the phone .
got it . don &apos;t worry , peter .
i &apos;ll be watching from the car .
all right .
mr. de luca ?
we &apos;ve got eyes on de luca .
you -- i remember you from the warehouse .
you &apos;re too young to be the dentist .
i &apos;m not the dentist . i &apos;m his lip man .
oh , you &apos;re his lip man .
he &apos;s his lip man .
well , i do my own talking .
and my message goes directly to the dentist ,
not to some flunky ,
so no dentist , no deal , all right ?
he &apos;s a no @-@ show . jeffries will be mortified .
hey , hey , all right , all right , all right .
hey . the dentist is here .
neal , what are you doing ?
where ?
black sedan , north side of the street .
well , that could be anybody .
i &apos;ll need some proof .
okay .
ask him a question .
diana , have mozzie take over this call .
the dentist is in .
mr. de luca has a question for you .
ask him ...
what &apos;s his favorite ice cream ?
mr. de luca would like to know ,
what is your favorite ice cream ?
seriously ?
bubble gum .
bubble gum .
dentist pulled a con -- a big one -- on my father .
i want him to pull the same hustle
on this guy here in new york
who , uh , wasn &apos;t so friendly to me .
who &apos;s the mark ?
patrick o &apos;leary .
irish mob .
all the details are in there .
de luca thinks o &apos;leary &apos;s responsible
for his father &apos;s death .
rule number one -- don &apos;t mess with the family .
he came all the way here
to put the dentist in the middle of a mob war .
mozzie gets caught in the crossfire .
two birds , one stone .
what sort of con did mozzie pull to
have de luca so pissed ?
i don &apos;t know , but it involved
stealing 500 grandfrom de luca &apos;s dad .
no wonder they &apos;ve got it out for the dentist .
who they think is you .
what &apos;s that look ? i don &apos;t like that look .
de luca wants the dentist to run a con .
if you go through with it ...
and put the cash in de luca &apos;s hand ,
we got him on extortion .
de luca goes down ,
and mozzie and jeffries are free .
that &apos;s why we pay you the big bucks ...
... if we paid you .
think we can get mozzie to tell us how he did it ?
you threaten him with a future of toilet wine ,
and he will sing like a canary .
i can scare him pretty good .
before i tell you anything ,
i want complete immunity
and the truth behind darpa &apos;s --
no and no .
you are still a suspect in a dozen other crimes .
start talking .
fine .
but the statute of limitation
protects crimes committed by a minor .
minor ? how long ago did this happen ?
when i was 12 .
you were 12 when you stole 500 grand from the detroit mob ?
gifted child .
there &apos;s your immunity . talk .
look , when you &apos;re an orphan ,
a @-@ a family is like your holy grail .
mr. jeffries worked really hard to find me one , and he did ,
a wonderful urbane couple from sterling heights .
they taught me about all the finest things in life --
music , art .
they were quite decent ...
... for people who wore suits .
what went wrong ?
they had a son --
an only child .
their son -- he got jealous ,
so he stole a priceless family heirloom
and pinned the crime on me , and i got scared ...
ran away .
i hit the streets .
i got a job making book for a numbers guy .
before long , i knew the business better than he did .
i &apos;m tellin &apos; you , biggie ,
if we open a policy bank ,
we can centralize where runners report bets ,
we can hire more people , and we can triple our profits .
ah ! get lost , kid .
biggie ? seriously ?
problem was , who &apos;s gonna trust a kid ?
adults like to feel superior .
they want to think they &apos;re smarter than everyone else .
so i learned the art of the con .
dang , bruno , six in a row !
sometimes i wish i worked for someone
who knew what he was doing ,
someone with some brains , you know ?
like you .
oh , bruno , not the hair , man .
you got yourself a patsy .
you use what you learn .
i talked bruno into opening a back office
in a betting parlor .
he was the public face of the dentist .
i was the brains .
why &quot; the dentist &quot; ?
i was 12 .
a dentist was the scariest thing i could think of ,
and ... it worked .
together , bruno and i
ran the biggest street lottery in town ,
had runners working for us all over the city .
the dentist is busy . come back later .
people loved us ...
except the ones who owed us money .
that &apos;s when de luca came in .
he didn &apos;t like me cutting into his profits .
frankie jr . , stay by the car .
de luca caught wind of the dentist ,
threatened bruno into closing shop .
what are you looking at ?
i wanted payback ,
so i got de luca sr. on a wire con .
he went in for 500 large .
how &apos;d he find out you were the kid behind the curtain ?
bruno sold me out .
he told them i was the dentist .
i had to retire the moniker -- no more dentist .
i took the money , left for new york ,
and became a new person .
all right , what about everything
attributed to the dentist since then ?
de luca didn &apos;t want the world to know
he &apos;d been taken by a prepubescent grifter .
he started the rumor that the dentist was superman .
yep .
the dentist became the perfect patsy
for every criminal in the northeast .
you &apos;re a living conspiracy theory .
see ? they do exist .
ohio turnpike clocked jeffries &apos; car
running a toll a couple of hours ago .
mr. jeffries would never run a toll .
he &apos;s a very conscientious driver .
wait ! that &apos;s another clue !
do they have a photo ?
it &apos;s on its way .
look , mozzie &apos;s given us everything we need
to run the con on o &apos;leary .
what are you gonna do with him now ?
i &apos;m gonna check and recheck every case in this file .
your story better hold up .
it will .
you &apos;re in danger ,
and you &apos;re a liability to us on the street .
jones , take him to a safe house .
an fbi @-@ monitored safe house ?
that &apos;s legalized torture !
it &apos;s that , or i set you in lockdown
until this is over .
ah , safe house it is .
but -- but i have demands .
my atopic eczema requires custom @-@ made silk pajamas .
reading glasses , slippers , sleep machine -- all vital .
oh , and -- and i have soft gums ,
so i &apos;ll be needing my electronic toothbrush .
do we look like your errand boys ?
fine . then no complaints
when i &apos;m forced to sleep in the nude tonight .
make a list .
i &apos;ll make a list .
you &apos;re giving me a headache .
this isn &apos;t exactly the plaza of safe houses , is it ?
the mattress isn &apos;t hypoallergenic .
i saw a dead mouse on the bathroom radiator .
ah , lucky bastard got out while he could .
all right , here are the items you requested , moz .
oh , great . right here .
thanks .
oh , you touch anything ,
and you &apos;ll be hearing from my lawyer .
you are your lawyer .
scared ?
got pictures of jeffries at the toll .
oh , let me see that .
look what &apos;s on the dashboard .
yeah , a book , a cd .
a particular book , a particular cd .
&quot; escape from freedom . &quot;
a masterpiece .
and the cd -- &quot; la femme . &quot;
freedom . femme .
lady liberty .
yes !
he &apos;ll be going to the statue of liberty when he gets here .
i @-@ i guess it &apos;s worth checking out .
you guess ?
you see what i have to put up with because of you ?
how long do i have to stay in this stygian limbo ?
you won &apos;t be safe until we run the con
and get de luca in cuffs , okay ?
i beg of you , hurry , for the sake of my sanity .
and mine .
this is our mark -- patrick o &apos;leary .
those of you from organized crime know him well .
de luca plans to scam o &apos;leary
for half a mil in a wire con
and pin it on the dentist .
this is our chance to take them both down
and stop a mob war .
de luca is coercing the dentist into running the con for him .
now , unfortunately ,
de luca wants his guy present at the scam
to make sure things are running smoothly .
which means we &apos;ll have to go through with the wire con
if we &apos;re gonna put the cash in de luca &apos;s hands .
i &apos;ll need a half dozen flat screens ,
professional satellite equipment ,
and video @-@ delaying software .
we &apos;re gonna build a betting site to rival the competition .
how do we get o &apos;leary there ?
eliminate the competition .
come on , guys .
enjoy your ride downtown , gentlemen .
what &apos;s this -- some kind of bust ?
illegal off @-@ track betting . site &apos;s closed .
anonymous tip was called in .
you a customer ?
innocent bystander .
besides , your car looks filled up .
we can make some room .
it can tow up to 5,000 pounds .
come on , big fella . watch your head .
sorry to hear about your place , o &apos;leary .
if you need something new ...
5715 park avenue south
you &apos;re the rat who probably called the feds .
that would be my boss .
he &apos;s trying to drive business his way .
those were my friends . tell your boss he &apos;ll be sorry .
sure thing ...
or i could help you send a stronger message .
what does that mean ?
my boss has me picking up strays on the sidewalk
like a bench advertisement .
we have our differences .
so you &apos;re on the outs with your boss . what do i care ?
because i can help you take him down .
who are you ?
a lip man trying to move up in the world .
how &apos; bout we take this conversation
somewhere a little more private ?
i still can &apos;t believe you &apos;ve got mozzie
in an fbi @-@ monitored hotel .
we call it a safe house ,
and diana &apos;s headed there for company .
ooh , muffins .
ah , ah , no . these are for mozzie .
oh , seriously ? you really feel that bad for him ?
him , diana cooped up together in that room ...
you &apos;re amused by all this .
you just want to go there on your own , don &apos;t you ?
yeah . can you blame me ?
no . but you &apos;ll need permission from the head agent
if you want to see him .
oh , really ?
please ?
permission granted .
thank you .
all right , now , on a serious note ,
this case that you &apos;re doing with neal -- is it dangerous ?
no , it &apos;s more fun than dangerous .
you saw &quot; the sting , &quot; right ?
与保罗 · 纽曼出演
yeah , something to do with horses and betting .
if the mob &apos;s involved , how could it not be dangerous ?
door &apos;s open , neal .
who knew the ball and chain cleaned up so nice ?
ah , you don &apos;t look so bad yourself .
so , who &apos;s newman and who &apos;s redford ?
i &apos;m newman . he &apos;s redford .
did you talk to de luca ?
yeah , he &apos;s dropping leo at the parlor in an hour .
we should go .
oh , wait . before you go , hold on .
i got to get this .
all right , prom picture .
say &quot; cheese . &quot;
cheese .
beautiful . be safe , please .
we will .
what do you say , newman ?
you ready to scam half a million dollars for the detroit mob ?
let &apos;s go , kid .
not a bad setup .
glad you like it .
building it was like pulling teeth .
dentist humor .
you &apos;re enjoying yourself .
yeah .
looks like we got company .
there &apos;s de luca &apos;s guy .
all right , i &apos;m on it .
looks like the kind of place
someone could lose a lot of money .
o &apos;leary close ?
yeah , our guys clocked him leaving his office
10 minutes ago .
well , by the time he gets here ,
there &apos;s gonna be five races left on the card .
that &apos;s five chances to get the money .
can you do it ?
yeah .
you know , you could have at least baked a file into these .
oh , please .
i don &apos;t think they have love seats in the joint .
oh , the joint ?
oh , do you know your way around the big house , do you ?
i may have spent some time in jail once ...
or twice .
a repeat offender ?
the first time , i got caught with a fake i.d.
&quot; allegedly . &quot; never confirm .
right . and the second time ?
second time , i allegedly streaked across campus .
mrs. suit !
well , it was college . i lost a bet .
does the husband know about this ?
he might know about one of them .
i &apos;ll let you guess which one he knows .
all right , so , tell me ...
about these de lucas that my husband &apos;s meeting with , huh ?
he &apos;s a killer .
i @-@ i was 12 , and i can only imagine
what they would have done to me , given the chance .
that &apos;s why i left detroit and changed my name .
um ... gin .
so , you just kept running from the de lucas ?
i mean , have you thought about confronting them ?
putting an end to this whole feud for good ?
yeah .
i hadn &apos;t .
but now they &apos;re threatening people i care about .
if anyone should be taking a bullet from de luca ,
it should be me .
i miss anything ?
he set the bed on fire ?
no , no . he behaved .
i &apos;m gonna -- i &apos;m gonna get going .
elizabeth , um ...
peter will be fine .
yeah , i know he will .
bye . i &apos;ll call you .
i need some fresh melon .
mr. o &apos;leary , delighted to have you .

shame .
we &apos;ll need to check your briefcase .
my associate will show you around .
have a good time .
so , walk me through this .
i installed a worm on the central computer
that delays every feed .
we &apos;ll get the race results three minutes before my boss ,
giving us a small window to place the bet .
he &apos;s bound to realize the feed &apos;s delayed .
yeah , which is why we have
to hit it hard and fast if we &apos;re gonna do this .

with your glossy smile and those annoying little hats .
you love my hats .

you never do what i tell you to do ,
and every time i turn my back ,

hey , diana . everything okay ?
mozzie pulled a ferris bueller .
he &apos;s out ?
yeah , that &apos;s not the worst of it .
soverow &apos;s shame in the lead ,
but coming up on the outside is amazon eddie !
amazon eddie moves into the lead !
now might be a good time to slip out .
tell de luca i &apos;m ready .
nice work . he &apos;ll be expecting you .
now two lengths !
soverow &apos;s shame trying her best to make up ground ,
but it &apos;s too little too late .
it &apos;s amazon eddie for the win !
no !
i was set up .
this whole damn thing was a setup .
you did this .
what ?
hey , is there a problem ?
there &apos;s a problem .
he had his guy lure me here to get my money with a delay .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
you &apos;re damn straight you do .
you know who i am ,
and you know what i &apos;m capable of , okay ?
so you tell your associate --
my associate is a con artist , which is why i fired him .
so listen -- i don &apos;t want to cause another scene here .
so how about i just give you the money that you came in with ,
you walk out of here , and we &apos;ll call it even ?
hey . you get o &apos;leary calmed down ?
he went for it .
jones is escorting him and his money out back .
that &apos;s one problem down .
we have another problem ?
yeah .
i got your text .
you &apos;d better have a damn good reason for changing the meet .
as my moniker suggests , i &apos;m a big fan of bridgework .
i don &apos;t have time for games . give me o &apos;leary &apos;s money .
frank de luca jr .
we meet again . long time , frankie .
who the hell are you ?
i &apos;m the man your father spent 30 years looking for .
i &apos;m the real dentist of detroit .
squad &apos;s still five minutes away .
i want a perimeter around the bridge .
what the hell was mozzie thinking ?
no clue .
all right , so the guy from the meeting a couple of days --
works for me .
i &apos;m the man who scammed your father .
no myth -- the legend of detroit . - guys , guys .
it ends here , today , on this street .
seriously , who the hell are you ?
1981 , brush park .
you knocked my bubble @-@ gum ice @-@ cream cone onto the ground .
really ? that was you ?
you made a fool of my father ?
and your father had a thing for blood feuds ,
and he ended up six feet under because of it .
yet here you are , doing the exact same thing .
i thought you wanted to be your own man , junior .
can &apos;t make out a weapon on de luca .
should we move in ?
we &apos;ve got nothing on him ,
unless de luca picks up that briefcase .
that o &apos;leary &apos;s cash ?
yeah .
but we both know this isn &apos;t about the money .
this is about taking me down , only it didn &apos;t work .
well , i can take care of that right now .
yeah , you could .
come on , moz . give it to him .
and then my people could go after you ,
and your people could come after mine .
you see where this is going ?
what the hell is mozzie doing ?
fighting his own war .
we can end this .
you could just walk away ,
and the suits can &apos;t touch you .
what do you mean -- the suits ? you talking about the feds ?
yeah . only you know them as my lip man and his boss .
you set me up ?
you set me up , you freakin &apos; weasel ? !
aw , someone got double @-@ crossed in this ?
we should all be shocked .
that &apos;s what happens .
i &apos;m gonna turn and walk away .
you can be smart and do the same thing ,
or you can make the same mistake your father did .
your decision .
pick it up . pick it up .
my father would have wanted it this way .
fbi ! fbi !
drop your weapon !
drop your weapon !
drop your weapon !
fbi ! fbi !
drop it , drop it ! drop it !
freeze !
drop your weapon !
now i &apos;ve got you on extortion and attempted murder .
you should have listened to him .
hope it was worth it , de luca .
please don &apos;t go rogue on me again .
what the hell is wrong with you ?
you should have let me handle this .
de luca &apos;s always armed , and he &apos;s good .
s.w.a.t. or not ,
he most likely would have shot you , suit .
and if we hadn &apos;t shown up ?
i knew you would .
thank you , peter .
you guys ever tried bubble @-@ gum ice cream ?
you got your stuff from the feds .
yeah , complete with fbi taint .
you doing okay , moz ?
i know how hard it is to give up everything .
i @-@ i couldn &apos;t do it .
i kept a part of jeffries with me ,
and i know i &apos;m lucky i get to do that .
and i know your connection to the fbi ,
but it &apos;s not who we are .
when we do finally get to sell our art ,
we really have to remember that .
what are you saying ?
oh , you and peter --
enjoy it while it lasts .
hope you don &apos;t mind -- i brought a friend .
mr. jeffries ?
you &apos;re okay !
your fbi friends found me at lady liberty .
i &apos;m glad you got my clues .
i told you , suit .
you haven &apos;t changed at all ,
except for a bit more character up there .
oh , well , father time has a cruel sense of humor .
how &apos;s everything down at the group home ?
i know my donations weren &apos;t much , but ...
they were enough .
&quot; the smallest good deed &quot;
&quot; is worth more than the grandest intention . &quot;
oh , duguet .
&quot; good deeds are the seeds to good actions . &quot;
temple . &quot; action is eloquence . &quot;
shakespeare .
&quot; false eloquence is exaggeration -- &quot;
&quot; true eloquence is emphasis . &quot;
alger . good one .
are they really having a quote @-@ off ?
oh , yeah .
my goodness .
is that mozart ?
he loved this little bear --
couldn &apos;t pronounce his name , though .
kept calling it &quot; mozzie . &quot;
a sentimentalist .
yeah .
i can &apos;t believe mozzie
kept tabs on jeffries all these years .
