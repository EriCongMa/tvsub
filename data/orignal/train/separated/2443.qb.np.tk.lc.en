to get home , we &apos;ll harness the power of the eclipse
using a mystical relic .
what about bonnie ?
she sacrificed herself so i can come back .
where did you put your magic ?
i put it somewhere safe .
i hate you
because if i don &apos;t hate you
and i have to hate myself .
and i deserve better than that .
she hates because she &apos;s got a thing for you , mate .
i got a look at lady whitmore &apos;s labs .
it turns out the injury doesn &apos;t exist anymore .
you &apos;re not just a liar , but you &apos;re a liar with secrets ,
i &apos;m older than you .
by 5 minutes .
just trying to check what page we &apos;re on .
when the coven calls us home ,
they don &apos;t care if we &apos;re in love or not .
you sound like dad , and that &apos;s not a compliment .
josette .
where are they ?
oh , jo . come on out jo ?
i know you can hear me .
josette ?
where are they , jo ?
everything &apos;s gonna be ok , all right ?
everybody &apos;s just playing a game .
you guys want to play a game ?
you want to play hide @-@ and @-@ seek ?
ok .
come on out , jo .
you know i won &apos;t kill you .
wakey , wakey .
how did i ...
get so lucky to arrive here
on a private flight piloted by yours truly ?
oh , you would have been superimpressed with my flying skills ,
but i &apos;d already knocked you out with painkillers .
where are we ?
portland , oregon ,
stomping grounds of courtney love , tonya harding ,
and tons of other awesome people .
you could have brought me anywhere in the world ,
and you took me to portland ?
this is where i grew up .
i &apos;ve been counting eclipses
since i was imprisoned on this empty planet ,
and according to my running tally ,
i &apos;ve been here for 6,771 supernaturally repeating days ,
so in the real world , which we &apos;ll never get back to
because you sent your magic away in a teddy bear ,
today &apos;s my favorite day of the year .
and what day is that ?
thanksgiving .
i &apos;m cooking you dinner .
i &apos;m a vampire .
i don &apos;t know . maybe a little less emphasis on vampire .
i &apos;m ... a vampire .
i mean , there &apos;s only so many ways you can say it .
well , maybe liam will stop digging
into lady whitmore &apos;s miraculous recovery ,
and you won &apos;t have to come clean .
or he &apos;ll keep digging , realize that i force @-@ fed
her my vampire blood , and then just bail .
ok . you know all of this can go away with one fell mind wipe .
so lie and lie again and again and again .
ok . if you want to tell him the truth ,
i support you 100 % ,
but if you &apos;re rushing into this
to escape some conflicted feelings over a certain ex
who just came back into your life ,
then i suggest you keep your fangs to yourself .
jo .
where &apos;s alaric ?
don &apos;t kill the messenger .
something about an impromptu guys &apos; weekend .
you can &apos;t miss friendsgiving .
i mean , matt and jeremy are already cleaning up
the whole tripp mess , and caroline &apos;s mom has to work .
we &apos;re already low on friends as it is .
well , if it &apos;s any consolation ,
our thanksgiving was roadside chili .
hey . were you invited to friendsgiving ?
of course . caroline demanded i bring string beans .
why ? were you not invited ?
nope .
ooh , boy .
you messed with the wrong girl &apos;s feelings .
what do you mean bonnie &apos;s in the prison world ?
damon said that she wasn &apos;t there ,
that she found peace with--
why didn &apos;t he tell me this ? &apos;
why wouldn &apos;t i consult you in a decision that
might permanently change your life ?
i wonder .
he didn &apos;t want to get your hopes up .
he honestly thought bonnie died trying to free him .
if she sent her teddy bear over ,
it could mean she &apos;s still--
bonnie &apos;s still alive ?
oh , my god !
so we &apos;re in portland right now ,
trying to track down some gemini thing .
ascendant .
this is amazing .
alaric , you might want to keep the news to yourself .
i tracked this lead 4 months ago .
it was a dead end .
stefan sends his love .
wait . what--
bonnie &apos;s alive ?
is that the reason caroline assigned me
the turkey and the cranberries ? stefan wasn &apos;t invited .
see what you did ? now we &apos;re pulling your weight .
i really hope you figure this out before christmas .
yeah . well , i &apos;m glad you &apos;re both finding amusement in this .
why don &apos;t you just date her , put us all out of our misery ?
because i don &apos;t think about her that way . she &apos;s my friend .
who would make a great girlfriend .
look . one , she &apos;s hot objectively .
two , she puts up with you .
big plus . 3 , very , very well organized .
organizational skills ?
there are no drawbacks to this woman , stefan .
eh , she did sleep with you .
see ? another plus .
oh ! look . we &apos;re here .
behold the gemini coven exactly how it looked
4 months ago .
memories .
pitter @-@ patter of little siblings &apos; feet ,
witchy @-@ woo , chanting in the air ,
mom and dad calling me an abomination .
why did you want to come back here ?
because i can finally show it to someone .
my coven goes out of their way to make sure no one finds us ,
but since they &apos;re not here to be paranoid freak shows ,
mi casa es su casa .
come on .
like i said , uh , 3,000 miles ago ,
it &apos;s not here .
can we , uh , go home now , please ?
you know what ? check the gps again .
just because we don &apos;t see anything doesn &apos;t mean it doesn &apos;t exist .
not unlike caroline &apos;s feelings for stefan .
hilarious . keep them coming .
oh , no . is stefan feeling sensitive
about ruining his friendship with caroline ?
she really liked him , and he broke her heart .
see , stefan ?
even the bear knew .
i saw that from a mile away ,
and my brain &apos;s made of cotton .
give me this .
ms. cuddles one ,
invisible creepy mansion zero .
where do you want the stuffing ?
well , hello to you , too .
i &apos;ll take that .
hi . i &apos;m jo .
you look--have we met before ?
liv , and no , but you &apos;re dating my occult studies professor ,
which i guess somehow earned you an invite for thanksgiving dinner .
nice to meet you , too .
where &apos;s luke ?
he &apos;s outside testing a new filter on his phone .
he &apos;s making me this stupid retrospective video
for our birthday .
22 . go us .
what &apos;s with her ?
liam , hey . you &apos;re here .
bearing the white wine of surrender .
i owe you an apology .
i checked lady whitmore &apos;s medical records again ,
and everything was normal ,
which i would have known if i had double @-@ checked them
before making accusations that were unfounded , baseless , dickish .
is that enough adjectives ?
getting there .
am i glad to see you .
you , too , liam .
come on .
would you mind ?
yeah .
thanks .
did you ...
risk my career switching lady whitmore &apos;s medical chart ?
i &apos;m glad it worked .
yeah . thank you .
anybody want to take a stab at how
bonnie &apos;s teddy bear undid whatever was cloaking this place ?
he said without laughing .
jo told me she got rid of her magic
by putting it away for safekeeping .
maybe bonnie put her magic away in this .
why would bonnie put her magic in ms. cuddles ?
to keep kai from using her to get out .
can &apos;t say i miss that .
it &apos;s all yours , brother .
that smells great .
not exactly a turkey dinner ,
but it &apos;s what my family had in the fridge on may 10 , 1994 .
don &apos;t touch that .
heh . your pager ? why ?
because it &apos;s brand @-@ new , looks cool ,
and i don &apos;t want you to bust it .
listen , kai . my magic &apos;s gone ,
which means we will be stuck here forever .
why don &apos;t we just divide the world in half
and go our separate ways ?
i get it .
i knocked you out , kidnapped you against your will .
you don &apos;t see i &apos;m trying to apologize ?
i will never trust you
or like you or enjoy your company for
so much as one second , so just quit trying .
just let me leave here unharmed .
fine . can we at least have one last dinner conversation
before my eternity of aloneness resumes ?
so you agree ?
one last dinner , and then we peacefully
go our separate ways .
in the spirit of thanksgiving , i &apos;ll even let you take my car .
how can i help ?
all right ! if everyone could gather
around the table at their assigned seats ,
then , um--
oh . sorry i &apos;m late .
we will each share something that we are
thankful for in 100 words or less , so ...
do you want a drink ?
once we sit , there &apos;s a good chance caroline
won &apos;t let anyone get up .
i &apos;m not really in the mood .
did i do something to piss you off ?
no , tyler . you didn &apos;t .
uh , anyone want to see some embarrassing baby videos of liv ?
oh . you know what ? now would actually be
an excellent time just to shut down anything
with an on @-@ off button .
whoever wins has to make ...
no . please let the food get cold .
whatever that is is far more important .
happy birthday ! wave to me !
hi , josie .
hi , josie .
how old are you ?
4 .
how do you add that ?
you guys want to do some numbers ?
ok . what &apos;s one plus one ?
two !
two plus two ?
4 !
nice .
what are you watching ?
that kind of sounds like your voice .
that is my voice .
i took that video 18 years ago
at a birthday party for the twins .
oh , my god .
lukas and olivia ?
jo as in josette ?
hang on . you guys know each other ?
i &apos;m their sister .
jo lived here .
there &apos;s a drawer inside full of stuff ,
newspaper articles about jo &apos;s medical clamp ,
pictures of her as a kid ,
pictures of her as a teenager .
hold , please . rewind .
that &apos;s kai from planet 1994 .
wait . jo is his sister ?
either that , or they both have a thing for cosby sweaters .
i didn &apos;t know i had guests .
you &apos;ve met kai ?
met him ? watched him die ,
watched him come back to life .
why ? you know him ?
yeah . he &apos;s my son .
i &apos;m joshua parker .
damon salvatore .
invisique .
what the hell just happened ?
i don &apos;t know .
what &apos;s wrong with you guys ?
they can &apos;t see you anymore , damon ,
which means they also can &apos;t see this .
no !
so if you don &apos;t know each other ,
then how did you all just happen to end up
at the same tiny liberal arts school ?
we had a family friend here--sheila bennett .
you knew bonnie &apos;s grams ?
she took me under her wing .
she also helped my family put kai away .
kai ? wh--kai as in damon &apos;s kai ?
as in our brother , my twin .
there are two sets of twins in your family ?
yeah , there were until my coven
put kai in a prison world .
now there &apos;s just luke and me .
i &apos;m sorry . did you say coven ?
oh , my god . liam ...
is still here .
i think he meant oven .
yeah .
oh , look ! we don &apos;t have a wine opener on the table .
liam , you have a wine opener in your room .
why don &apos;t you get it ?
take your time .
as you were saying , you put kai away ?
kai killed 4 of our bothers and sisters to make a point ,
but he was really targeting lukas and olivia .
why them ?
because in our coven , twins are in line to be leaders .
hence our lame @-@ ass name--gemini .
kai wanted to be the leader ,
but that wasn &apos;t possible if lukas and olivia were alive .
so i protected them with magic .
which just pissed him off more .
where are they ?
my brother was born without his own magic .
he can only draw it from others .
it made him feel like a freak .
my parents saw him acting out ,
isolating himself , and they realized that
he &apos;d never be capable of leading our coven ,
so he kept having children until another set of twins were born .
kai figured it out , and he snapped .
where are they ?
i just need some information .
not looking to make enemies .
funny way of showing it , buddy .
you were trapped with kai .
i need to know how you got out .
strangest 4 months of my life .
that whole repeating the day thing ,
phew , disconcerting .
is kai still there ?
yeah , he is with my friend bonnie ,
which leads me to why i &apos;m here .
does kai know how to escape ?
look . i &apos;ll tell you everything you want to know ,
but first , i need something from you .
it &apos;s round , about yea big ,
a bunch of little gears and wheels and things .
it &apos;s a lot harder to describe than i thought .
the ascendant .
yeah . you know it . where is it ?
why would i give you the key to my son &apos;s prison ?
because i &apos;ll say please .
do you have any idea what it feels like
to come home and find 4 of your children dead ,
another one impaled , two running for their lives ?
do you think that image has ever left my mind ?
he was a psychopath , so they sent him away .
kai went to his prison , jo dodged a bullet ,
and now the leadership falls on us .
ok . well , now that we &apos;ve all gotten to know each other
a little bit better , could someone please pass the dinner rolls ?
sorry that my family drama
isn &apos;t appropriate dinner conversation , caroline .
that &apos;s not what i meant .
liv
just ...
leave me alone .
ok . i think i may have missed something .
if you and liv can both be the leaders of your coven ,
why did she just get so upset ?
because there aren &apos;t two leaders , are there , jo ?
in our coven &apos;s tradition ,
after their 22nd birthday ,
the twins merge their strength .
the stronger one wins , absorbing their twin &apos;s power ,
and the weaker of the two ...
the weaker of the two what ?
the weaker one dies .
caroline &apos;s out looking for you .
she wanted to apologize .
why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
what ?
that my coven requires my brother and me
to merge when we turn 22 ?
because that &apos;s not totally screwed up .
you &apos;re talking to a guy with a gene that turns him into a wolf .
look . if you don &apos;t want to merge , then don &apos;t .
your coven doesn &apos;t control you .
my coven needs a leader .
you don &apos;t understand that because you &apos;re not one of us .
you &apos;re not even supposed to be in my life .
let me help you .
you can &apos;t help me .
why do you think i &apos;m trying to get rid of you ?
when i look at you ...
i feel everything i don &apos;t get to have .
i either die in the merge ,
or i get to live with the fact that
i killed my own brother .
so tell me , tyler , how can you help with that ?
so when you say merge ,
you don &apos;t actually mean merge , do you ?
that &apos;s exactly what i mean .
if kai gets out , he &apos;ll head straight for jo .
his ability to siphon magic will overwhelm jo ,
and she will die , and our coven will be left
to the whims of a madman .
which is now moot thanks to blond and blonder ,
thank goodness .
look . let &apos;s talk about this ascendant .
i won &apos;t let him out , damon .
all right . i wasn &apos;t gonna say anything
because you &apos;re his dad and all ,
but if he gets out , i &apos;ll just kill him .
it &apos;s that simple .
i &apos;ve watched jo her whole life .
she &apos;s done well on her own , survived war ,
become a doctor , but if jo merges with kai ,
she will cease to exist .
kai won &apos;t just be our coven &apos;s problem .
he &apos;ll be everyone &apos;s problem .
i think i met your dad .
well , that &apos;s improbable considering he lives in portland .
believe it or not , i &apos;m actually in portland .
ric , you need to tell me what &apos;s going on right now .
damon &apos;s gone , as in into thin air ?
oop . careful . you just sounded genuinely concerned for my brother .
i don &apos;t have feelings for him anymore .
that doesn &apos;t mean i want him to blink out of existence .
he didn &apos;t . it &apos;s some sort of cloaking spell .
alaric &apos;s on the phone
with jo trying to figure out how to break it .
and to think we could have all been sitting around stuffed ,
playing board games .
so just to be clear , jo was invited to friendsgiving ,
but i wasn &apos;t .
friend code states that in matters such as yours and caroline &apos;s ,
i must , with no exception ,
take the side of my best friend .
and you should just kiss and make up . it &apos;s getting weird .
you &apos;re just mad because no one knew how to carve the turkey .
how did you know that you could trust me ?
trust you with what ?
when you were honest with me
about what you were .
how did you know that you could trust me
with such a huge secret ?
it &apos;s easy .
i was in love with you .
i want you to know everthing .
you owe me dinner .
ric , listen to me .
if my dad knows that you want to open kai &apos;s world ,
he &apos;ll think you &apos;re willing to free him .
he &apos;s going to retaliate .
phesmatos incendere ad pulvox .
what the hell are you doing ?
and i hate to break it to you , ric ,
but you traveled 3,000 miles for nothing .
the ascendant &apos;s with me .
you got to be kidding me , right ?
jo ? you ok ?
something &apos;s wrong .
jo ?
jo , what &apos;s wrong ?
i think my dad ...
jo , what the hell is going on ?
my dad &apos;s trying to kill me .
what the hell is she talking about ?
her dad &apos;s trying to kill her ?
jo , jo , answer the phone .
ric ?
elena , what the hell &apos;s going on ?
something &apos;s happening to jo .
you have to find her dad and stop him
from whatever he &apos;s doing to her .
well , that &apos;s gonna be problem
because even if we could see the house
i haven &apos;t been invited in .
invite him .
you can come in !
but we can &apos;t see the damn house .
they need magic !
crap .
elena , we have to do something .
definite signs of hemoptysis .
shut up , liam .
ask them if they see an old tree stump in the front yard ?
yeah , i see it .
go there now !
really ?
you &apos;ve been eating that same piece
for 45 minutes .
is it a crime to want to savor our last meal together ?
i had thanksgiving dinner with you .
now you keep up your end of the deal
and give me your car keys .
i should probably teach you how the clutch works . it &apos;s finicky .
quit stalling and give me your keys .
fine . i &apos;m stalling .
but don &apos;t you want to hear how my story ends ?
i &apos;ve read the newspaper .
you murdered your siblings ,
and your coven sent you to live in this prison world .
my family sent me to this prison world .
my father ,
the great coven leader who treated me like crap
for 22 years and then locked me here .
it &apos;s like his--like his kids didn &apos;t even matter .
coven always came first no matter what .
if kai has access to an ascendant
and is sharing his prison with the bennett witch ,
he will eventually find his way out .
at least , this will keep him from merging .
you &apos;re just gonna take out jo ?
the coven comes before family .
what the hell are we gonna do with a knife ?
maybe it &apos;s jo &apos;s version of ms. cuddles .
nice shot .
invisique .
well , i guess the , uh ,
disappearing act &apos;s their shtick .
yeah .
hey . anybody hear from jo ?
you need to tell me what &apos;s going on .
you have to get more ice .
i &apos;m not an idiot , elena .
i know you &apos;re lying to me , so whatever it is ,
just tell me , please .
she &apos;s crashing !
dr. laughlin , look at me .
jo , can you hear me ? jo !
come on , dr . laughlin . please wake up .
check for dilation .
holy crap .
what the , what happened to her ?
i don &apos;t know .
call 911 . i &apos;ll start cpr .
call 911 , elena . we need help .
she &apos;s about to die .
liam ...
liam , there &apos;s not enough time .
what are you doing ?
elena , your face .
it &apos;s ok . my blood will heal her .
jo ?
i &apos;m ok .
i &apos;ll get you some water .
elena . elena , stop !
how did you do that ?
how did you do that ? !
i &apos;m a vampire .
you &apos;re what ?
it doesn &apos;t matter because as much as i like you
my life is complicated enough .
so you &apos;re not gonna remember anything from tonight
or about lady whitmore
or the fact that we even dated at all .
you &apos;re gonna go home , get some rest ,
and i &apos;ll see you at work on monday .
i &apos;ll see you monday , elena .
olivia , lukas ?
olivia ?
lukas ?
come out . come out wherever you are .
stop !
i &apos;ll do it .
i &apos;ll merge with you .
just don &apos;t hurt anyone else .
so jo agreed to the merge ?
well , we need a celestial event ,
so the plan was to
use the power of the eclipse happening the next day .
she even gathered our coven to help .
the power of the eclipse will merge us as one .
you know what to say ?
been practicing my whole life .
sanguinem desimilus ...
sanguinem generis fiantus .
i don &apos;t feel anything .
sanguinem desimilus ...
sanguinem generis fiantus .
josette , what did you do ?
why can &apos;t i feel your magic ?
and why aren &apos;t they saying anything ?
they should be saying something .
they should be saying something , right ?
we &apos;re merging . this should all be a bigger deal .
sanguinem filio ,
sanguinem effurgarex perpetuum .
sanguinem filio ,
sanguinem effurgarex perpetuum .
phesmatos filio ,
phesmatos effurgarex perpetuum .
they tricked me good .
instead of using the power of the eclipse for the merge ,
my dad used it to send me here ,
and where &apos;d jo &apos;s magic go ?
you know , it made zero sense .
magic doesn &apos;t just , like , disappear ,
but then you made yours disappear
when you hid it in miss . cuddles , and it hit me .
my sneaky little twin sister
hid her magic ...
in this .
still there .
still here
and still full of magic .
well , it was .
i just sucked it out .
you have magic again .
good for you .
i also have the ascendant .
doesn &apos;t matter . you need a bennett witch to do the spell .
about that . i &apos;ve watched you do the spell twice now .
i don &apos;t think i need a bennett witch to do the spell .
i think all i actually need
is bennett blood .
all right . so let &apos;s just get this straight .
we went to the airport , we took off all our clothes
for security just so i can come out here ,
have my brain scrambled by papa kai ,
who by the way can disappear into thin air--
poof -- only to find jo &apos;s rusty knife full of magic .
and we learned that the ascendant ,
i.e. the only reason we flew our asses out here in the first place ,
is actually with jo
at whitmore 5 minutes from where we started .
great .
jo said she kept it with her to ensure
that kai would never be released .
genius . great . then we go home .
shotgun . come on .
guys , hey . we can &apos;t do this , ok ?
we need to find another way
and one that doesn &apos;t end up with my girlfriend dead .
girlfriend ?
you &apos;ve been on , like , 3 dates .
nice , damon .
what ? i &apos;m just saying he barely knows her ,
and her literal evil twin is over there with bonnie right now .
guys , i will do what i can to help ,
but we &apos;re not letting her brother out , all right ?
the ascendant is off the table .
ok . get the ascendant from jo .
do whatever you got to do to get it ,
you understand ?
i understand .
what are you doing ?
what ? you got a better idea ?
good morning .
where am i ?
you passed out , so i brought you home .
you kidnapped me ? romantic .
i am protecting you , liv .
i &apos;m not letting you sacrifice yourself
because your coven needs a leader .
they &apos;ll come after me .
let them .
magic doesn &apos;t work in mystic falls ,
so if your coven wants to find you ,
they &apos;ll have to do it the old @-@ fashioned way .
they &apos;ll have to go through me .
i &apos;m sorry i ruined thanksgiving .
you &apos;ll make up for it next year .
we &apos;ll find another way , liv .
i &apos;m not going to let you die .
you &apos;re here .
that &apos;s good .
that actually saves me a trip .
needless to say , there were leftovers .
you made me a doggie bag .
just because i hate you doesn &apos;t mean i want you to starve to death .
besides , bonnie &apos;s alive .
you know , this is , like , the first thanksgiving
in forever where there &apos;s something to actually be
thankful for , so ...
caroline , um , look .
when damon was gone , i , um--
i pushed you away .
yeah , i know , stefan .
you pushed everyone away .
it &apos;s kind of what you do .
but i pushed you away the most .
i knew that you were the one person who would
sit with me and let me cry ,
and i didn &apos;t want to cry anymore ,
so i
had to push you away the most .
thank you for saying that .
listen .
enjoy the leftovers .
you should have brought me with you .
well , first , you should have told me that bonnie was alive ,
and then you should have brought me with you .
well , ric had more frequent flyer miles ,
and ric didn &apos;t deliberately forget our entire relationship .
yeah . i deserve that .
so you and bonnie spent the last 4 months together ?
yeah .
what did you do ?
bicker mostly .
cooked , ate .
we went through a tetris phase , but i beat it ,
and she got mad .
we talked .
a lot .
apparently there are a lot of words in the english language ,
and bonnie knows just about all of them .
yep .
i know this is gonna sound pretty strange ,
but i &apos;m really happy that
the two of you had each other .
she sacrificed herself so i could come back .
because when she wasn &apos;t talking , she was listening .
she listened for hours and hours and hours ,
so when the opportunity presented itself for me
to come back , she made sure i took it .
what did you talk about ?
what do you think ?
i broke up with liam .
dr. future humanitarian award wasn &apos;t good enough ?
what went wrong ?
what do you think ?
look . i &apos;m at a crossroads right now ,
where i could go live my life
the way i think i probably should and be successful
and safe and probably very happy ,
or i could risk all that
for this tiny glimmer of a feeling inside
that i just can &apos;t shake .
well , robert frost , what &apos;s it gonna be ?
i don &apos;t know ...
but i do know someone who could give me some pretty sound advice .
any chance you &apos;d be willing to help me
bring my best friend bonnie back ?
so i can ask her ?
sure .
what ?
&quot; i lied &quot; ?
there &apos;s no car .
the bastard took the car .
