Accept.
That is all you have to do right now.
And it is enough.
Come on.
Breathe, Rachel.
The count is full.
Jenkins winds up, delivers.
Breaking ball. Aah!
Mother of Francis!
No! Jo Friday, off!
Hello! A little help!
Oh! Come on! The play's at second!
What are you doing?!
Well, at least somebody's appreciative.
Hey! Jo Fri-- off, Jo Friday.
Jane, what are you doing?
Why'd you give the dog our burgers?
You want food? Go hunt and gather, all right?
Okay, if that's a pizza,
I'm sorry for anything I have ever done,
Especially, Tommy, when I locked you out of the house
and pretended like I didn't know who you were.
Did she really do that?
Still crying over it.
Daddy.
So, you gonna invite your old man in, or what?
Level of decomposition suggests
she's been here for at least two days.
She's still not picking up.
She does have a personal day. Still...
This is the first case
they're working together since the shooting.
Look at this.
"Professional frenemies?
Cop shoots medical examiner's mob father."
Sheesh. That's bad.
Jane didn't have a choice.
Paddy would have pulled the trigger on us.
You and I know that, but how would you feel if I shot your father?
My father's not a mobster.
You having a hot flash?
Your cologne not working for you today?
The medical community is debating if men go through menopause.
You could be experiencing a decrease in testosterone.
I got plenty of testosterone.
How about you, Frost?
Love the smell of deco in the morning.
Ooh, maggots like it, too. Look here.
Steam from the pipes has accelerated decomposition.
You know, few students know about these old tunnels.
2.1/4 miles of them run beneath the university.
They were constructed to house steam pipes...
They should just apologize for whatever they said
to each other in that cat fight.
"Cat fight"? Women hate that expression.
They do?
Damn! So many new rules.
Hey, Janie, you got any more chips?
Can you believe the contract they gave this guy, huh?
Calls himself a pitcher.
Can't even throw the speed limit.
Good one, Tommy.
Oh! What are you doing?
Pilgrims lost 8-7. - Jane --
You disappear for a year,
and then you show up to "Bro-out"
over a day-old DVR'd ballgame?
I came here...
to give you this, okay?
"Once upon a time,
two wonderful people fell in love"?
You're gonna love Lydia. She's a dynamite lady.
Tommy, something you want to say?
Leave your brother alone.
Tommy?
No. I-I mean... I...
Look, look.
We see each other when I'm in town, all right?
When you're in town?
You know, Tommy's the only one
who never -- who never judged me.
Well, Tommy's always been so flexible
about what's right and wrong.
I don't want you bullying your baby brother.
That doesn't work anymore, pop.
Talk, Tommy.
I introduced him... to Lydia.
Wait till you meet her.
You're divorced, so how do you plan
on having this big catholic wedding?
Yeah, the church kind of frowns on that.
Just some paperwork I got to fill out.
What kind of paperwork?
Oh, my g--
You're gonna try to get an annulment, aren't you?
Janie, it's a piece of paper. It means nothing.
Does Ma know she didn't mean to have kids?
Look, I have no desire to hurt your mother, all right?
She doesn't know, does she?
You haven't even had the guts to tell her.
So, I guess that makes us all bastards.
Hey. Where you been?
My father remembered he had a family and popped by.
Wow. My dad's a dick, too.
No, I'm busy feeling sorry for myself.
Now I got to feel sorry for you, too?
Well, this'll cheer you up. We got a body.
Rachel Lawson, 25.
Grad student in earth and planetary sciences.
Now I feel sorry for her, too. Where's the body?
It's down there.
How long she been there?
Looked like a couple of days, but you could ask --
Relax, Frost. I'll ask Dr. Isles.
Victim rented a car. It's parked outside.
There's nothing in it.
Here's the rental car agreement.
"BCU campus car."
She was a V.I.P.
She rented a car every weekend for the last 20 weeks?
Yeah, it's a lot of mileage. See?
Maybe she was going home.
She's from Boston.
She wasn't due to return the car until tomorrow.
Well, where was she going, and why'd she come back early?
Studies show that 5% to 7% of the male pop--
Hello... Detective Rizzoli.
Hello, Dr. Isles.
Well, I don't see any drag marks.
No. Lividity confirms that she was killed here.
She's passed through rigor.
So she's been dead at least 36 hours.
She's in workout clothes. What was she doing down here?
She was strangled.
Thank you, doctor. I can see that.
Looks like the weapon was a garrote.
Garrote.
Gee, I would love a history lesson on the...
...garrote. Wouldn't you, Frost?
Well, It was most popular in the 17th century.
When it was used as a means of silent assassination
by the thuggee cult in India.
Well, let's be on the lookout for the thuggees.
What are those red patches?
Urticaria.
Urticaria?
Oh, uh, maybe you'll know what this means.
The yucky red stuff is a rash.
Uh, thank you for clearing that up.
Yes, that was a good explanation.
Let's go.
You stay.
You have any idea what Rachel was doing in the steam tunnels?
Steam tunnels? What steam tunnels?
You have any idea what this is?
It was Rachel's.
Okay, let's take it with us.
Uh, where's her bedroom?
Should I be worried?
In horror movies,
they always get the roommate next.
The campus is on high alert,
And there are campus police outside your apartment.
You'll be safe.
And here I thought I missed out
on the whole "Roommate bonding" Thing.
Oh, what a relief
"Cruelty free cotton."
I hate it when people are mean to cotton.
And vegan shoes. Can you say "Vugly"?
Says the woman who's been wearing the same boots
for the past two years.
Oh, snap!
Okay, Rachel had a "Skinny" Section and a "Fat" Section.
How do you know about "Skinny-fat" clothes?
I've tried on all sizes.
Oh, snap again! Whoa.
All right, what do we got here?
Loofah, aloe vera toothpaste...
A crystal...
That's a deodorant.
How do you know?
Told you -- all sizes.
Oh, hello!
Here's a sure way to keep the weight off.
Cocaine.
Why? Why would somebody do this?
Rachel was the kindest person.
Did Rachel mention any problems she was having?
Maybe with friends?
No. She was there to study environmental geology.
She was very dedicated.
She worked very hard.
Was she seeing anyone?
NO.
She wouldn't have talked to you about that.
Mr. Lawson, did you just come from a business trip?
No. Why?
Your watch is set to a different time than your wife's.
Are you separated?
Yeah.
Did you tell Rachel?
I told Rachel I was leaving her mother...
When I brought her back to school after winter break.
That's when she started going down into the tunnels, isn't it?
We don't know why she was there.
Why do you say that?
Rachel wasn't an only child. She had an older sister.
Emily died when Rachel was 7.
Rachel would go down into the basement.
She would sit there in the dark for hours.
When she was really suffering,
She'd find a place...
It was my fault she was in those tunnels.
This may not be my place...
but this beautiful girl loved you both very much.
Honor her by being kind to each other.
You just pulled a midnight.
What, did you take another shift?
All this stuff with pop,
I'd figured I'd at least make some overtime.
You talk to Maura yet?
Frankie, I don't think we're ever gonna be friends again.
We just keep making it worse.
Okay. Thank you. Yes. Okay.
Dad hasn't told her?
No.
I ran a check on her. On Lydia.
Frankie, you can't be doing that.
They watch stuff like that, all right?
What'd you find out?
You don't want to hear it.
No, I don't. Tell me everything.
She's 28 years old.
She's younger than us! Mm-hmm.
Hey, Rizzoli.
You got a minute?
Yes, sir.
Hey, Frankie.
Hey. Lieutenant.
Look, how we doing with that murdered BCU girl?
I'm getting a lot of heat from the brass.
Parents are going nuts over there.
Uh...yes, uh, I haven't actually... spoken to Maura -- dr. Isles...
Just sign it, and then everything is fine.
...in... I just want an annulment.
Are you okay, Rizzoli? Is everything all right?
...this piece of paper right now.
Just do me that favor. Okay?
Sure. Sure, I'll sign it.
Good.
Over your dead body!
All these years I had to put up with your snoring!
My snoring?!
What about your creams and your -- and your flossing?
In the bed, you flossed!
That's right! Right.
In our marriage bed, where we made three children!
Ma, come on.
That's right, and you still treat them like kids.
Okay, move on, Angela!
Frank, come on. This isn't the time or place.
Let's take it outside.
This is not your business. I'm talking to my wife.
Your ex-wife.
Thank god.
I will not dishonor our children!
I won't do it!
Angela!
I idolized you. You know that?
Janie...
No, no. I don't want to hear it.
You need to go, pop.
Ma...
Tommy?
Hey. Maura.
How you doing?
How'd you get down here?
Oh, I got my ways.
Tommy, this area is secure.
I'm on the job.
Murphy's funeral home needed more pick-up guys.
Guess your people are too busy with murders,
so they hired me to pick up the ones that just croak.
Well, great. Congratulations.
So, listen, I, um... I kind of need some advice.
From me? Sure. Shoot.
Well, you know my dad's back.
I heard about what happened at the caf?
Jane told you?
Uh, no. No. Jane and I are...
not so,
close as -- as we used to be.
Well, you know my dad's getting remarried, right?
Yeah, he told us today.
No wonder jane was so off.
Well, I mean, it's kind of a good thing
that you and jane aren't talking.
Oh, no, it's not. It's awful.
Well, I just mean, you know, now that you're not talking,
maybe we could
Tommy.
What? A guy's got to dream, right?
Advice. You said you needed advice.
Right. I'm gonna tell you something,
but you can't tell anyone.
I'm a vault.
I, uh...
I kind of...know...
my dad's fiancee.
"Know."
as in the biblical sense?
Yeah. That sense.
I-I mean, I only "knew" her one time,
but that's just still wrong, right?
I mean, do you think I should tell my dad?
Lower extremities are well-muscularized,
no evidence of trauma.
Results are in on the white powder.
What, from the victim's apartment? Was it cocaine?
Negative for cocaine.
Well, what was it?
Heroin? Crystal meth? Ketamine?
Sodium. Bicarbonate.
Tricky. Baking soda.
Thank you, Susie.
Uh, you're welcome.
Nice work, senior criminalist Chang.
Nice work, chief medical examiner Maura.
Well, that explains why Rachel had white powder
in her shower caddy.
"Caddy"?
Livor mortis is indiscernible.
Okay. I'm sorry.
Please explain to me why she had baking soda in her caddy.
You were just being nice because you want information.
She used it to wash her hair.
It's less toxic to the environment than shampoo.
Well, that's commitment.
She's really fit, yeah?
She's had anterior dislocations
to both her left and right humerus bones.
I'd love to know why that's relevant.
It's too bad you don't guess.
Well, you're in luck. It's national guessing day.
Are you celebrating?
I am.
She has these injuries because of repeated
chaturanga dandasana to urdhva mukkha svanasana.
I know what that is -- yoga.
Are you breaking out in hives from the guessing?
Not yet.
And her rash is the result of "Defatting,"
the chemical dissolution of dermal lipids.
What's that in "Yucky rash" lingo?
She was submerged in icky stuff.
Oh, submerged, great.
So the vegan girl is bathing in chemicals
great.
Jane.
What? I thought we were done.
Okay.
Rachel was not snorting coke.
What was she doing with it?
Washing her hair.
That's expensive shampoo. You --
Jane.
It was baking soda, all right, Frost?
So why was she in the tunnels,
who was in there, and why did they kill her?
Uh, Jane, you should,
Did you check her financials?
She owed bcu 27 grand, which --
which is weird, because
it was all covered with student loans and grants.
So what'd she do with all that money?
I'll get a subpoena for her bank records.
Yeah, we got to figure out what this is.
Oh! Nice T.P. Tail.
What?
Why didn't you tell me?
Tell you what?
We didn't even notice.
Yeah, right. They can see it from across the street.
God, can this day get any worse?!
Sorry.
Find the symbols on Rachel's tile.
There it is.
It's trademarkd.
"Sensei Matta yoga."
Rachel's bank shows automatic
monthly payments to the same place.
She spent $25,000 on yoga?
In five months?
Enlightenment is expensive.
Owner's name is... sensei Matta.
Well, that's not the name his mother gave him.
Yoga studio is nearby. Come on, let's go talk to him.
He went to a lot of trouble to hide his identity.
Maybe we keep it on the down low
so we don't spook him?
Stop!
Frost, track his business records,
find out what his real name is.
Come on, Korsak. Let's go do some yoga.
Crap.
What?
Floater just beached himself
on the north bank of the Charles.
Man, you're lucky.
It's probably a suicide. You'll make detective.
Yeah, when I'm 104.
Come with me.
Really?
Yeah, come on.
Would you pay 25 grand to look like that?
I'd rather drink my six-pack.
Have a boston whaler with a tuna tower.
Welcome. Love and light.
Oh, I'm sorry, this is a caffeine-free zone.
Uh, I'm -- I'm sorry. We had no idea.
Oh, that goes in composting.
The middle one.
It's so wonderful when couples come in together.
Oh, we're not a --
Accustomed to... such a nice yoga studio.
Yoga is an excellent way
to keep up with the demands of a young wife.
And I'm very demanding.
Whew, you sure are... babe.
I teach a beginners' class in a few minutes.
You'll take it.
Oh, no, no, no. No.
We're not dressed for yoga.
Actually, we would like to meet sensei Matta.
Nobody meets the master until after class.
You have anything a little less...
stretchy?
His eyes and his tongue are gone.
That's from fish activity, right?
Looks different in the books.
He's got boobs.
It's from the bloating.
He's been in the water a... a while.
Hey. Look at his forehead.
You think that's fish activity?
It could be blunt force trauma.
So it might not be a suicide.
Right?
Hey, hey, hey. Come here. Grab his arm.
We can pull him out ourselves, right?
I'll get him.
Tommy. What are you doing here?
Working. What?
You think you and Jane are the only Rizzolis
that can look death in the face? Move.
All right.
How about you?
Can you look death in the face?
And as we easily hold our balance,
take your gaze to the ceiling and breathe.
With your right hand flat on the floor,
take that left arm and extend it to the ceiling
and reach.
As we move from half-moon ardha chapasana,
into an easy variation king dancer...
If it's so easy,
why doesn't she come up with something harder?
I'm scared.
Can you please stay on your own mat?
If you can't do this simple pose,
just do adho mukha svanasana.
I'd like to adho mukha svanasana her.
I'll help.
Apparent skull fracture.
Holy crap, it's my first murder.
Stop right there!
I can't take it. I can't do it.
What? W-what'd I say?
This man might have hit his head when he jumped.
Or slammed into rocks when his bungie cord snapped.
For all I know,
Wile E. Coyote dropped an anvil on his head.
It was just a gut feeling. I --
This is a scientific process.
Do you understand, officer?
You do not guess, leap to conclusions,
speculate, theorize, wonder,
or tell me about your gut.
Am I clear?
Yeah. Clear.
I hope you experienced
a little bit of love and light transformation.
Words cannot begin to express.
Yeah, we're so transformed,
We're ready to meet sensei Matta.
He rarely leaves his spiritual retreat
in western Massachusetts.
But you said after --
It's a ways, but it might be worth it.
What's the address?
You can't know that until you ascend.
That girl, hon -- what was her name? Rachel...?
Oh, Rachel Lawson,
The one that told us about this place.
That's the one, yes.
She said she'd been to the retreat.
Rachel ascended very quickly.
Huh. Must be flexible.
Sensei Matta believes Rachel is, uh...
Spiritually gifted.
I'll get you packets to fill out.
Now that you're ready to ascend,
you'll put a credit card on file.
Rachel's parents said she didn't have a boyfriend.
Yeah. But they didn't know
she was "Spiritually gifted," either.
I got a bad feeling.
Me too.
Anything?
Yeah. A lot.
Got a name -- Matthew Moore.
That's your sensei Matta.
Well, how are we gonna find his retreat
in all of western mass?
What are these shaded areas?
I've been busy.
Sensei Matta yoga bought 20,000 acres there,
all within the last year.
It's all protected land. How?
Using their nonprofit religious exemption.
Ohh, now I really have a bad feeling.
I'v also been through all of BCU's security footage
of tunnel entrances.
Rachel started going in five months ago.
Right after her parents separated.
Then she stopped for months.
Started going again two weeks ago.
I want to know what happened two weeks ago.
Me too.
Last time was three days ago,
The day she was murdered. No one followed her.
There's a lot of tunnel entrances in campus buildings.
Somebody was in there.
The victim's rash was caused by benzene and 1,4-dioxane,
Likely from a fresh water source.
I've narrowed it down to seven lakes in western Massachusetts.
Are you saying those lakes are polluted?
I'm not. The ph levels and mineral content are.
Swell. My sprout troop used to
have sleepover camps at one of those lakes.
You were a sprout trooper?
Yes. Why is that so hard to believe?
You mean because it is your
"duty as a sprout trooper
to be kind, friendly, generous"?
I was so sweet and kind,
I won "Sweetest Camper."
Two years in a row.
So, ha ha ha.
Was anyone else there?
To watch you... accept your award?
Nice recovery.
The pollution must be recent because it's not showing up
in any of the water quality reports.
Bet you that's where Rachel
was driving that campus car to.
Well, it's a small needle in a big haystack.
I am going there and doing my own water quality testing.
Hey! Dr. Isles...
Since you're going anyway,
would you get a statement from Matthew Moore?
Goes by the name of Sensei Matta.
Oh! You can't have a medical examiner
go get a statement from a suspect.
That's my job.
Hey! You two can go together.
I'm sure she's taking a different road.
There's only one.
You're right. I am.
I have to go get a few things.
I'll tell Cavanaugh.
Swing and a miss.
Ah. Where's your car?
Hey, Mo, it's Korsak.
Hey! My car!
What are you doing to my car?!
Uh, my job.
I don't know how many times I've told you about parking here.
I park here every day, Mo.
Oh, not today.
Have a great rest of your day, all right?
I'm gonna rent a car.
Yeah, me too.
Don't forget your lunch!
What is that?
Mortadella on foccacia bread,
with a little roasted red pepper.
Korsak put you up to this?
All I'm going through, and you two can't be civil?
Don't you dare pull the annulment card.
He wants me to sign a paper
that says I didn't want you kids!
Ma, we're grown-ups.
We know you wanted us.
If you're such a grown-up,
then act like one and stop this!
Hey. Just saw big Mo towing your cars.
You want to borrow mine?
Oh, you're good.
One little thing for your mother,
and you can't do it?
It is more energy efficient if we take one car.
Fine, but I'm driving.
Why do you get to drive?
Because it's an unmarked, and because I'm a cop,
and becau-- just get in the car, Maura!
Have a good time, girls.
I am not listening to Led Zeppelin.
I'm not listening to Yo-yo Ma.
I don't listen to yo-yo ma...
...in the car.
Oh, that's right, pardon me.
Yo-yo Ma's just for the jacuzzi.
Put your seatbelt on!
It's on!
The next lake is 42.3910 degrees north.
Longitude? Really?
Can you just tell me to "turn left at Popeye's Chicken"?
There is no Popeye's Chicken in western Massachusetts.
72.3830 west.
The acoustic vibrations of hard rock
have been shown to increase the risk of an accident.
Did you pass gas?
No, I did not!
Okay.
Hey, ma.
Are you girls having fun?
Oh, yeah, we're great.
Maura's having gastrointestinal issues.
I am not!
Jane used to fart on long car rides
and blame her brothers.
Did you just say "fart"?
Have you listened to the audiobook yet?
It's in the cooler.
Uh, "What to do when your former best friend is a bitch"
Really?
Mm. Too bad it's wet!
Have fun. Love you both.
Bye, ma.
Our Charles river floater is Paul Mcnamara.
He was a professor at Waltham University.
Professor of hydrology. Studied groundwater. Hmm.
Fracking is an
invasive way to extract natural gas.
Proponents say it will liberate the U.S.
from dependence on foreign oil.
But my research indicates
it will destroy the environment.
750,000 views.
Wow. Popular professor.
Mm. Not everybody loved him. Listen to this comment.
"What does this idiot tree hugger
want us to put in our gas tanks?
How about his blood?"
Somebody killed him.
We don't know that, Frankie.
You saw the front of his head.
Oh, wait.
You -- you didn't, did you?
Remind me not to invite you to my next floater.
Go straight past the coniferous spruce.
Maybe I'll pass a hemlock, too.
Oh, look. A homo sapien.
Oh, crap. In a guard booth.
Love and Light.
Love and Light. You here for the retreat?
Yes.
Okay, what's your name?
Oh, uh, our names may not be on your list.
We -- we just ascended. Today, in fact.
Oh. Well, unless you have your double platinum soul certificate,
I can only allow you go as far as the public picnic area.
Ohh. Well, we understand.
Love and Light.
Love and Light.
Let's hope he doesn't run that.
There's the lake.
Nothing gets pass you.
Love and Light.
Hurry up.
Okay. Oh! Shoot!
We need to leave.
No, I need to talk to Matthew Moore.
No. Listen to me. We're in danger.
Those don't look like yogis.
What did you take a picture of?
I'll tell you in the car.
Please! Trust me.
Rachel definitely swam in that lake.
And I know why it's so polluted.
I saw fracking equipment.
What is fracking?
It's a controversial process to drill for natural gas.
They pump hundreds of chemicals thousands of feet underground.
It pollutes groundwater.
You've got to be kidding me.
That's why we pulled a Thelma and Louise?
Well, Jane, it's illegal here.
Rachel was a geologist.
Maybe Sensei Matta didn't bring her here to sleep with her.
Maybe he brought her here to help.
Yeah, but she wouldn't have helped.
Her interest was in the environment.
Exactly.
So maybe she saw what you saw,
She uncovered the fracking, and that's what --
You okay?
I-I think so.
Oh, crap.
My phone is wet.
What? What? Can you move your leg?
No, it's stuck.
Okay.
Get down! Get down! Get down!
Maura, get out of the car.
Get out of the car!
I can't get my leg out!
Maura, get out of the car!
My leg is stuck!
Maura, go!
Run!
Stay down. Stay down.
Go for the tree line. Go! Go!
I got Jane's voicemail again.
Cell service is iffy, though.
Maybe they're yelling so loud,
they can't hear their phones.
What is that?
Looks like a partial impression of a shut-off valve,
a big one.
You only find equipment like this in boiler rooms.
I think your floater was in the tunnels.
Where we found Rachel's body?
Yeah, I think his head was smashed against
a shut-off valve somewhere in the tunnels.
We might be looking at a double homicide.
So, how'd he get in the river?
There's an outflow of the tunnel
that dumps right into the Charles.
Look for a link beteen Rachel Lawson and Paul Mcnamara.
Come on. We got to try to keep going. Come on.
We haven't seen them in hours. I need to stop.
Okay!
What? What? Did you pull something?
No.
Take it off.
All right, all right.
Oh, my god, Maura.
Your leg, I-it's hard, and it's cold. It's like a dead body.
What that?
It's compartment syndrome.
Well, what does that mean?
The post-tibial artery must have ruptured in the crash.
But you've been walking on it!
Blood from the artery is leaking.
The pressure built.
And now the blood is trapped
in one of the lower compartments of my leg.
Okay, bottom line it for me.
The blood supply to my lower leg has been compromised.
I'll lose my leg unless --
Unless we get you to a hospital.
Maura, come on!
No, unless you do a fasciotomy.
I need something sharp.
What? No, Maura, I --
Maura, I'm not gonna cut your leg off
with a nail file.
Do you have sugar packets?
No, why, did you bring coffee?
I could use it to dress the wound.
Do you still have your phone?
Yes. Yes.
Why didnit think of that?
That's luck. We can call 911.
Oh, it's busted!
The touch screen is Gorilla Glass.
No, Maura.
I'm -- I'm not gonna do this.
It'll work. Okay.
You're gonna make a six-inch incision right here.
And a five-inch there.
Okay, just try not to cut the superficial peroneal nerve.
No. I can't do this.
Take off your shirt.
What? Okay, now I know you've suffered a head injury.
And let's go. To bind the wound. Okay, come on.
Oh, god, Maura. Please -- please don't make me do this.
Listen to me. Listen to me.
You just keep on cutting, okay,
Till the blood starts to flow.
Maura, I'm sorry. I can't do this.
You're a sprout trooper! Okay?
Just -- once you make the double incision,
you massage the wound like this.
Okay, the blood will be black.
I can't. I can't. I'm so sorry. I can't do this.
I'm sorry.
I really like my leg, Jane.
Please.
Come on. Come on.
Oh, god.
Okay. Okay.
Okay.
All right. All right. You ready?
Okay.
Use more pressure. I'm okay.
You're all right?
I'm not okay!
Maura?
Maura?
Rachel was a PhD candidate in geology at BCU,
Mcnamara is a professor of hydrology at Waltham University.
Too close to be a coincidence.
She didn't take any classes with him.
Nope.
Any e-mail correspondence?
No. No phone calls, text messages, nothing.
Maybe she watched his "Fate of the earth" Talk.
Searching Rachel's browser history.
Hold on.
There it is -- his "Fate of the earth" Talk.
So, she knew his work on fracking.
They were talking to each other.
I found a thread in the comments section
between Mcnamara and "RockRachel."
What's it say?
"I have evidence of fracking.
"Can you meet today in tunnels under geo building?"
That's two weeks ago.
Looks like they met again...
The day Rachel was killed.
"Meet me. Same place. 3:00. Bad news."
Where the hell is Jane?
Come on, Maura, it's time to wake up.
I dreamt we were camping.
I voted for you.
Can you turn the heat down?
Come on, we got to get you out of here.
You won sweetest camper again.
I didn't win.
My leg hurts. Why -- why does my leg hurt?
Sensei Matta, I presume?
And you are officer...
Detective Rizzoli.
Detective?
Kind of stupid to drive a car
registered to the Boston Police out to my retreat.
Don't you think, detective?
Get up. Both of you.
My friend's hurt. She can't move.
Get her off the ground.
Let's go.
It's all right. It's all right.
What if their car crashed?
Try not to worry, Ma. I'm sure they're okay.
The state police would have called BPD,
Mrs. Rizzoli.
All right, thanks.
That was my contact in army personnel records.
Matthew Moore is an ex-army ranger.
He was a blackwater operative, too.
Sounds like one badass yogi.
I don't like it. I'm gonna take a ride up there.
Take a ride?
They could be at any one of those seven lakes.
I got to do something.
Jane and Dr. Isles are out there.
How'd you make the transition from yoga to fracking --
hard left at fraud?
This land is full of black gold -- all from shale rock.
I just needed capital to tap its potential.
And a religion to hide behind?
So you swindled vulnerable college students?
I was already a martial arts master.
Didn't take much to repackage what I knew and sell it.
You figured out that Rachel was a brilliant geologist,
and you brought her here to analyze your rocks for free?
Actually, she paid me for the privilege.
She was very obedient.
And she...helped until she realized
that you were destroying this wilderness.
She stole shale samples from me,
gave them to an environmental conspiracy crackpot.
I guess you could say we were at cross-purposes.
I'm a homicide detective.
Every cop from here to Boston will be looking for us.
Too bad you can't look behind you.
You'd have a nice view of the water when it comes through.
See, you're in a spillway for one of my reservoirs.
A few million gallons of water's gonna come pouring through here.
It's pretty toxic from all the fracking.
If I were you, I wouldn't drink it.
Let's go.
Come on!
Come on!
Try your phone.
I can't, Maura.
It's busted, and it got wet.
Call your mom. Tell her we're friends again.
Okeydokey.
Hey, Ma --
Oh, crap, it works!
The microprocessor dried.
Yay!
Maybe just texting. Wait.
Crap. No. I-I can only send symbols.
Son of a...
Type 42-point...
391...
0...
Okay, thank you, Maura.
It's morse code. Nice job, Maura.
What the hell?
That view is not okay.
Jane? Maura, you down there?
Korsak?!
Down here! Help!
You okay?
Yeah.
We got to get Maura out of here, all right?
The spillway to the reservoir is open. Hurry.
Did Sergeant Korsak come on our camping trip?
Great job with the morse code.
The coordinates put me almost on top of you.
Watch her leg! Watch her leg!
Can you walk?
Uh, I can hop.
You stayed with her.
I wouldn't leave her.
Frankie, come help!
They're back from the hospital!
Okay, I got her.
You got her?
All right?
Yeah.
I spoke to Korsak.
They got Sensei Matta and his guys.
Got her?
Yeah.
Are you sure you're okay?
Yeah. Let's get her some water.
So, I didn't tell my pop about knowing you-know-who.
I think that's wise.
You think I should tell my Ma?
No!
Tommy, did you hurt her?
No. No, no, he didn't.
My surgeon was very impressed with Jane's incisions.
I always wanted a doctor in the family.
Well, too bad. You got two cops and...
An undertaker.
No, no, no. No. Not doing that ever again.
I got three great kids.
I think you got a doctor, too.
Thanks.
And thank you for saving my leg, Jane.
I think you two should apologize to each other.
Butt out.
Butt out.
I'm sorry if you are.
Okay, but I'm less sorry.
No, we were both jerks.
You were both assholes.
Ma! Watch your language!
And...
...I didn't really win "Sweetest camper" award.
You didn't?
I missed you.
