for over a century i have lived in secret ,
until now . i know the risks , but i have to know her .
i &apos;m elena .
i &apos;m stefan .
i &apos;m damon .
you didn &apos;t tell me that you had a brother .
it &apos;s complicated .
elena , she is a dead ringer for katherine .
which one of you dated her first ?
katherine is dead , and you hate me
because you loved her .
i was hoping i &apos;d see you again .
she &apos;s not a puppet .
she doesn &apos;t exist for your amusement ;
for you to feed on whenever you want to .
they &apos;re whatever i want them to be .
wear it for me , for ... good luck .
you want to kiss me .
vervain in the necklace .
it &apos;s been a while since anyone
could resist my ... compulsion .
there &apos;s nothing human in damon .
no good , no kindness , no love .
only a monster who must be stopped .
hello ?
jeremy ?
hello ?
this is logan fell coming to you live
from the streets of mystic falls
with breaking news of another deadly animal attack .
the wild animal terrorizing the citizens of mystic falls
has claimed another victim ,
local high school student elena gilbert .
police are certain that forensic eviden will confirm
that this is the same animal responsible for recent attacks .
you know it &apos;s coming next .
bad dream ?
do you know how easy it was
to get into your head just now ?
you really need some human blood .
it might even the playing field .
football reference .
too soon .
all right , i deserved that .
but i just wanted to let you know ,
they caught the culprit .
the animal responsible for killing
coach tanner and all those people .
what are you talking about ?
it was a mountain lion . really big one .
it attacked a hunter this morning .
it &apos;s all over the news .
&quot; deadly beast captured .
all &apos;s well in mystic falls . &quot;
why would you cover your tracks ?
i &apos;ve decided to stay a while .
i &apos;m just having way too much fun here with you and elena .
can &apos;t touch her now .
well , the vervain keeps me out of her head .
maybe that &apos;s not my target .
believe it or not , stefan ,
some girls don &apos;t need my persuasion .
some girls just can &apos;t resist my good looks ,
my style and my charm
and my unflinching ability
to listen to taylor swift .
this is john varvatos , dude .
dick move .
i can confirm that a 12 @-@ foot puma mountain lion
attacked a hunter and was subsequently shot and killed .
the hunter is in stable condition .
the real animal is still out there ,
waiting for me , challenging me to fight back ,
to stop him .
but how do i stop a monster
without becoming one myself ?
to repeat , the animal terrorizing mystic falls
has been caught .
scum ball .
scum bucket .
who are you talking to ?
him .
the news guy ,
also known as logan &quot; scum &quot; fell .
did your mom ever tell you why i moved away from mystic falls ?
oh , no way .
you and him ?
this is logan fell .
he &apos;s cute .
he is not cute .
there &apos;s nothing cute about him .
what are you doing with that ?
i went yesterday and got it from the safe deposit box .
mom had told mrs. lockwood she would loan it
to the founder &apos;s council for their heritage display .
is that grandma beth &apos;s wedding ring ?
originally it was great @-@ great @-@ grandma mary &apos;s wedding ring .
how much do you think this stuff is worth ?
you know , like on ebay ?
you &apos;re not gonna find out .
that stuff is mom and dad &apos;s . you can &apos;t just give it away .
i &apos;m not giving it away .
it &apos;s called a loan , jeremy .
are you ok ?
i &apos;m good .
sorry .
maybe we should press pause .
yeah , you &apos;re probably right .
that was getting a bit ...
yeah . yeah .
how do you look in a suit ?
i can pull one off .
how about tomorrow night ?
will you be my date to the founder &apos;s party ?
they still do that ?
have you been before ?
no , the salvatores
don &apos;t get invited anymore .
well , this year , there &apos;s this heritage project
that meant a lot to my mom .
she was really involved in the founder &apos;s council ,
and it was her favorite party .
i know it sounds really boring , but
i would be honored to accompany you ,
miss gilbert .
the pleasure is all mine , mr. salvatore .
no yellow . jaundice . go for the blue .
i don &apos;t like the blue .
well , i do .
and if i &apos;m gonna be your date
you can not be my date .
my mother is going to be there ,
and she is a very proud gun owner .
i went through a lot of trouble
to make sure this party wasn &apos;t cancelled .
it &apos;s very important i be there .
please take me .
you should come to the founder &apos;s party with me .
not if you &apos;re wearing that dress .
what &apos;s so special about this bella girl ?
edward &apos;s so whipped .
you gotta read the first book first .
it won &apos;t make sense if you don &apos;t .
ah , i miss anne rice . she was so on it .
how come you don &apos;t sparkle ?
because i live in the real world ,
where vampires burn in the sun .
yeah , but you go in the sun .
i have a ring . it protects me .
long story .
will these bites turn me into a vampire ?
it &apos;s more complicated than that .
you &apos;d have to feed on my blood , then die ,
then feed on a human &apos;s , whole ordeal .
this book , by the way , has it all wrong .
you can be very sweet when you want to be .
yes , i can be sweet .
are you going to kill me ?
but not yet .
why not ?
because there &apos;s something i need you to do for me .
anything .
how good are you at getting this little nose
where it doesn &apos;t belong ?
oh , i &apos;m excellent .
so what happens with the season ?
one big forfeit ? are they looking for a new coach ?
i don &apos;t know , dad .
i doubt anybody &apos;s thinking about that right now .
charles , founder &apos;s party ,
focus .
how are you all doing over here ?
ah , we &apos;re doing great , sweetheart .
is there anything else i can get you ?
we &apos;re fine , thanks .
just the check , honey .
here you go , mayor lockwood .
thanks .
you &apos;re taking damon to the founder &apos;s party ?
what about me ?
go with elena .
she &apos;s asking stefan .
ok , go by yourself .
gee , thanks . what about your mom ?
is she ok with you bringing damon ?
and i &apos;m supposed to care why ?
he &apos;s older sexy danger guy .
older sexy danger guy ?
is that an official witch twitter tweet ?
no more witch jokes , ok ?
at whole mr. tanner prediction thing has me freaked .
ok .
and damon &apos;s not dangerous .
you know , he just has a lot of issues with his brother .
you know , like major , deep @-@ rooted drama .
like ... ?
i &apos;m not really supposed to say anything .
caroline forbes , when have you
ever kept a secreat in your life
ok .
but you can &apos;t tell elena .
no .
so what you gonna buy me ?
ugh , some class .
oh , your parents are gone . i guess you can be close now .
what the hell does that mean ?
you treat me like trash . i &apos;m sick of it .
i don &apos;t think you &apos;re trash .
really ? then who are you taking
to the founder &apos;s party ?
vicki donovan .
do you want me to ask you to the founder &apos;s party ?
no .
it &apos;ll be stupid and lame .
true .
but it &apos;ll be less stupid and lame if you were there .
you realize you had to ask him to ask you , right ?
you figure if you dress up like
a respectable young lady ,
he &apos;ll finally treat you like one ?
screw you , jeremy .
you know you &apos;re making the wrong choice ,
yet you make it anyway .
it &apos;s sad .
i didn &apos;t know you were here .
just going through stefan &apos;s homework .
boy , this country sure has dumbed down
in at last hundred years .
why he wants to go to high school is beyond me .
i mean , in the seventies , he went ivy league .
harvard , i understood .
actually , no . i didn &apos;t get that either .
go ahead , purge .
get it out . what &apos;s on your mind ?
why are you here , damon ?
to spend time with you , zach .
family &apos;s important .
i know you .
you always have a motive .
so tell me , what is it this time ?
you are in no position to question me .
i didn &apos;t mean to upset you .
this is not upset , zach .
what &apos;s going on ?
having a family moment , stefan .
spending some quality time .
hey , are you ok ?
no , i &apos;m not .
and neither are you .
how many more people have to die before you see that ?
i see it . all right , zach , i see it .
then why aren &apos;t you doing anything about it ?
i can &apos;t , zach .
i can &apos;t .
it would take human blood .
it &apos;s the only way that i could
stop him , and i can &apos;t do that
the vervain could weaken him
if he ingested it .
it would help get you the upper hand .
vervain hasn &apos;t grown here since 1865 .
damon saw to that .
the little i had , i gave to elena .
what ?
you &apos;ve been growing it .
it &apos;s just something that &apos;s been
passed down in generations
blood only runs so deep
when you &apos;re related to vampires .
damon would kill me if he knew that i had it .
but you &apos;re telling me .
why ?
because i trust you .
and you &apos;re gonna need it if you want to get rid of him .
i &apos;m here for my mom . i was supposed
to pick up a box
right here .
please be careful .
yeah , careful with it , dick .
hey ! not now , ok , guys ? please ?
i &apos;m fine . he &apos;s just being a punk .
i got your punk .
look , tyler ,
maybe you should go . tell your
mom that i &apos;ll see you tonight .
would it make a difference
if i told you i actually like vicki ?
not even if you meant it .
delicate flower vs. naughty vixen .
tough call . can we mix them ?
look at you , getting all pretty for your date .
you seem happy @-@ ish .
i am ... ish .
tonight &apos;s going to be a good night .
but don &apos;t let that stop you
from telling me whatever it is
you wanted to tell me as soon
as you walked in the door .
what if i tell you in the morning ?
i don &apos;t want to ruin the night .
bonnie , out with it .
ok , but it has to go in the vault ,
because caroline will kill me
if it gets back to damon that she squealed .
apparently stefan has a very interesting back story .
do you know what happened
with his ex @-@ girlfriend katherine ?
i know that they both dated her
and that &apos;s why they have issues .
yeah , they both dated her , only she chose damon .
and that drove stefan mad , he did horrible things
to try and break them up .
he manipulated katherine .
he filled her head with all these lies until finally
it worked , and she turned against damon .
that sounds like one person &apos;s side of the story ,
meaning damon &apos;s .
i just wanted you to know .
anyway , his past relationships
are none of my business .
unless he &apos;s a calculating , manipulative liar .
that is your business .
stefan is none of those things .
yeah ? how do you know ?
do they still wear ties at this thing ?
why are you even going ?
it &apos;s only fitting .
we were at the very first one , remember ?
i think it &apos;s better
if we don &apos;t draw attention to ourselves .
so you should stay here .
i &apos;ll see to it elena has a good time .
my goodness , i &apos;ve driven you to drink .
can &apos;t seem to rid myself of you .
what else am i supposed to do ,
besides go about living my life ?
go about living my life .
see , therein lies your eternal struggle .
you &apos;re dead , dude .
get over it .
what do you think ?
hello ?
hi , mrs. lockwood .
what do you mean ? it is ?
are you sure ?
&apos;cause i saw it .
let me check .
i will find it and bring it .
ok . bye .
what &apos;s wrong ?
ahh ! god , what now ?
the pocket watch . where is it ?
what watch ?
the one you stole from mom &apos;s box .
look , mrs. lockwood just called me , freaking out .
it was on the list , jeremy .
and she can &apos;t find it
and she thinks she &apos;s the one who lost it .
maybe she did . maybe tyler took it .
don &apos;t even play that card . jeremy , you took it .
if i go online , am i going to find it on ebay ?
is that how you pay for your pot ?
screw you .
i would never sell this , ok ?
then why did you take it ?
because it &apos;s supposed to be mine .
dad said it goes to the firstborn son .
his father gave it to him , and now what ?
and he was going to give it to you .
yeah .
look , jeremy , it &apos;s still yours , ok ?
mom promised mrs. lockwood .
what do you want me to do ?
just take it and get out .
it &apos;s cool not growing old .
i like being the eternal stud .
yes , being a 150 @-@ year @-@ old teenager
has been the height of my happiness .
you cracked a funny , stefan .
i should have a drink to celebrate .
you and katherine were the perfect couple .
it was hell watching you dance with her .
my happiness was short @-@ lived , as you well know .
i remember .
i left the party early , i was waiting for her .
the night you dropped her off
i was waiting just inside .
you were such a gentleman ,
gave her a kiss on the cheek .
and what she really wanted was ...
oh , well .
here &apos;s to history repeating itself , huh ?
i admire your effort , stefan .
pouring yourself a drink
then spiking the bottle with vervain .
i &apos;m not some drunk sorority chick .
you can &apos;t roofie me .
but i can &apos;t help but feel a little used .
i thought we were having a moment .
i have to go to the party anyway .
who knows what i &apos;ll do ?
enjoy yourself
great to see you . thanks so much to coming .
hi .
hi , nice to see you .
hi sir
lives too short ? that &apos;s nice
hey .
come on in .
uh , let &apos;s go this way .
why ?
line &apos;s too long .
we can go around back .
come on , party &apos;s in the back .
thanks for coming .
that was his favorite scotch .
i &apos;m sorry , i thought it would work .
i wasn &apos;t counting on it .
you knew it would fail ?
did what i wanted .
it lowered his guard .
you won &apos;t expect me to try again so soon .
i doubled what i put in the scotch .
caroline !
you look smashing .
thank you , mrs. lockwood .
this is my boyfriend damon .
oh , well , come on in .
lovely to meet you .
i &apos;ve been looking forward to
this party for quite a while .
well , enjoy .
wait here .
really , you couldn &apos;t even change out of the badge for this ?
i &apos;m working , honey .
who &apos;s the date you just tried to sneak past me ?
just some guy .
he &apos;s a little old for you , don &apos;t you think ?
oh , &apos; cause otherwise you &apos;d approve .
yeah , i doubt that .
hi , mayor lockwood .
hey. hey , guys , come on in .
thank you .
where &apos;s your dad ?
memphis . good .
with stephen .
your parents &quot; ?
there &apos;s a lot of history here .
jenna .
hello rogan
it &apos;s good to see you .
i thought i might see you here .
you knew it .
i dreaded .
but were secretly hoping .
and now that i have ...
whoa , hey , not so fast .
i know you . you have a lot more insults in you
i can tell .
your hairline &apos;s receding .
no , it &apos;s not . you want to have lunch ?
nope .
you haven &apos;t changed a bit .
oh , yes , i have .
i &apos;m meaner now .
&quot; the founding families in mystic falls welcome you
to the inaugural founder &apos;s council celebration . &quot;
wow , look , it &apos;s the original guest registry .
look at all these familiar names--
sheriff william forbes ,
mayor benjamin lockwood .
is that damon salvatore ?
and , look , stefan salvatore .
the original salvatore brothers .
our ancestors . tragic story , actually .
we don &apos;t need to bore them with stories of the past .
it &apos;s not boring , stefan .
i &apos;d love to hear more about your family .
well , i &apos;m bored . i want to dance .
and damon won &apos;t dance with me .
mm @-@ mmm .
could i just borrow your date ?
i don &apos;t really dance .
oh , sure he does .
you should see him .
waltz , the jitterbug , the moonwalk .
he does it all .
you wouldn &apos;t mind , would you , elena ?
it &apos;s up to stefan .
sorry , but i &apos;m not gonna take no for an answer
i want to apologize to you
for being such a world @-@ class jerk
the other night when i tried to kiss you .
there &apos;s no excuse .
my therapist says i &apos;m ...
acting out , trying to punish stefan .
for what ?
it &apos;s all in the past . i don &apos;t even want to bring it up .
let &apos;s just say that the men in the salvatore family
have been cursed with sibling rivalry .
and it all started with the original salvatore brothers .
damon told you to ask me to dance .
didn &apos;t he ?
now why would he do that ?
would you like one ?
thank you .
ok , just tell me if you see my mom .
the salvatore name
was practically royalty in this town .
until the war . there was a battle here--
the battle of willow creek .
right .
i know , we talked about it in class .
confederate soldiers fired on
a church with civilians inside .
what the history books left out
was the people that were killed .
they weren &apos;t there by accident .
they were believed to be union sympathizers .
so some of the founders
on the confederacy side back then
wanted them rounded up and burned alive .
stefan and damon had someone they loved
very much in that church .
and when they went to rescue them , they were shot .
murdered in cold blood .
who was in the church that they wanted to save ?
a woman , i guess .
doesn &apos;t it always come down
to the love of a woman ?
look , i &apos;m sorry that you and stefan
have this thing between you ,
but i can &apos;t get in the middle of it , damon .
i just ...
i hope you two can work it out .
i hope so , too .
so you want to dance ?
me dancing ?
not pretty .
maybe you could show me around .
i mean , this place is amazing .
yeah , if you like living in a museum .
maybe i should just strip naked
and give pastor bill a lap dance .
i mean , that &apos;s why we &apos;re
hiding in a corner all night , isn &apos;t it ?
you &apos;re scared of how i &apos;m going to act ?
you afraid of what your parents
are going to think about your date
from the wrong side of the tracks ?
i don &apos;t care about what they think .
great . let &apos;s go say hi .
knock it off , vick .
or we could just , you know
sneak up to your bedroom .
as long as nobody sees us , right ?
vicki , i swear ...
what &apos;s a matter , ty ?
you scared to stand up to your mommy ?
it &apos;s pretty pathetic .
let go !
tyler ...
we didn &apos;t get a chance to say hello earlier .
it &apos;s vicki , right ? matt &apos;s sister .
yes , ma &apos;am .
you &apos;ll have to forgive my son &apos;s rudeness .
he gets it from his father .
well , that &apos;s ok , mrs. lockwood .
tyler and i were just saying good night .
that &apos;s what you get when
you bring the trash into the party .
what &apos;d we miss ?
we were just chatting .
drink , damon ?
no , thanks , i &apos;ll pass .
stefan , do you have another dance in you ?
absolutely .
they look so cute together .
don &apos;t talk , please .
don &apos;t shoot . only need to refill
shooting and place carrion
feigned indifference . i like it .
i &apos;m over the banter , logan .
i &apos;d really rather you just left me alone .
i &apos;m sorry , jenna .
about your sister .
thank you .
came to the funeral .
i know .
i saw you .
yeah , i didn &apos;t want to push my way in ,
but i wanted to be there for you .
and when i heard you were staying in mystic falls ,
i thought maybe ...
well , maybe i could have
a second chance to make things right .
her name was monica , wasn &apos;t it ?
i hope damon didn &apos;t drive you too crazy .
no , actually , he was on good behavior .
he even apologized
and explained why he is the way he is .
and it all goes back to katherine .
so tell me about her .
what happened ?
it &apos;s not something i like to talk about .
i get that . i do .
i just want you to know that you can .
i mean , i burden you with all of my drama ,
and i want you to do the same .
i know .
thank you .
the truth is , stefan ...
i don &apos;t really know that much about you ,
and i &apos;d really love it if you would open up to me .
damon said something , didn &apos;t he ?
he likes to play games and cause trouble , elena .
this isn &apos;t about damon ,
it &apos;s about me trying to get to know you .
look , you &apos;re the mystery guy , and i like that .
but with mystery comes secrets ,
and this thing with katherine .
let it go . i don &apos;t want to talk about it .
well , then , say something about yourself . anything .
otherwise , i &apos;m left with nothing but what other people tell me .
don &apos;t you see what damon has done here ?
he &apos;s trying to get you to turn against me .
well , then i guess it &apos;s working .
this is my fault . i planted doubt .
i &apos;m a doubt planter .
it &apos;s not your fault .
i just-- i feel terrible
because i said that i wouldn &apos;t get in the middle of it ,
and that &apos;s exactly what i did .
i got all snotty .
elena , honey , there you are .
i notice the watch still isn &apos;t in the collection .
oh , um , i &apos;m sorry , mrs. lockwood .
i , um , i couldn &apos;t find it .
i guess it &apos;s still packed up
in my parents &apos; stuff somewhere .
i see .
well , please let me know if you do find it .
ok .
where have you been ?
looking for you .
your brother barely danced with me for five minutes--
ok , just a minute . stand right ... there .
um , you &apos;re not supposed to touch .
what is that ?
it &apos;s a very important crystal .
well , how did you know th it was there ?
because i put it there .
when ?
a long time ago .
tonight , i &apos;m taking it back , thanks to you .
well , what &apos;s it for ?
never you mind .
you can &apos;t just steal it .
it &apos;s not stealing if it &apos;s mine .
come on. well ...
vodka tonic .
ok , i know that this is probably going to be strike 3,
but i hope you can see it for what it is .
and what is it ?
persistence .
groveling , commitment . take your pick .
i fled town because of you .
fled .
i was young and stupid ,
and then things changed .
life got ... real .
you &apos;d know that better than anyone .
hypothetically speaking , if allowed ,
how would you make things right ?
well , more groveling , of course .
a recap of the past few years spent soul searching .
cheese fries .
obvious .
i know my audience .
yes to lunch . call me .
look around . what &apos;s missing ?
the flames , the candles .
why aren &apos;t they lit ?
there &apos;s matches in the kitchen .
bitch .
so how are things with stefan ?
great . just great .
really ?
well , my radar must be off ,
&apos;cause i was getting all sorts of other vibes ,
what is that ?
don &apos;t !
oh god , caroline , what happened ?
nothing , ok ? !
that is nothing . did somebody hurt you ?
no , ok , nothing .
it just ...
my mom would kill me .
did damon hurt you ?
no ! of course not !
just leave me alone , ok , elena ? !
god !
there is something seriously wrong with you .
you stay away from caroline
or i will go straight to her mother ,
the sheriff . you got it ?
stay away from her .
i &apos;m sorry .
i take it all back .
you &apos;re completely right about damon .
what did he do ?
there are bruises
all over caroline &apos;s body .
bite marks , and he has her all confused
and messed up in the head .
you don &apos;t look surprised .
i &apos;m handling it .
handling it ?
stefan , you should be having him arrested .
elena , please .
i ...
i don &apos;t expect you to understand .
i don &apos;t understand anything , stefan .
so why don &apos;t you just clear it up for me ?
look , there are things that you don &apos;t know , ok ?
things that i want to tell you , but i can &apos;t .
and i may never be able to .
and i just need you to trust me .
trust is earned .
i can &apos;t just magically hand it over .
i &apos;m so sorry . i have to go .
you look amazing. what are you doing here ?
i was thinking maybe i could make
one more wrong choice today .
i still have 17 minutes .
don &apos;t !
she took it off and i got flustered , ok ? !
i didn &apos;t know what to say .
but i swear , ok , i did not tell her .
i just told her that you didn &apos;t mean to hurt me .
you make me crazy , you know that ?
it &apos;s ok . i forgive you .
i swear i didn &apos;t say--
unfortunately ...
i am so over you now .
what the hell ?
you know , i couldn &apos;t spike your drink ...
so i spiked hers .
caroline ?
there you are .
i &apos;ve been looking everywhere for you .
are you ok ?
yeah . i &apos;m fine .
caroline , what happened ?
i &apos;m fine .
no .
you &apos;re shaking . caroline--what--
i &apos;m fine !
caroline , come here , come here .
i did what i had to do ...
to protect elena , to protect everyone .
yes , damon , the headline reads
&quot; deadly beast captured .
all is well in mystic falls . &quot;
thank you for staying so late .
did you get the gilbert watch ?
she claims it &apos;s packed away in her parents &apos; things .
i can get it .
good . we &apos;re going to need it .
are you sure ?
5 bodies all drained of blood ?
i &apos;m certain .
