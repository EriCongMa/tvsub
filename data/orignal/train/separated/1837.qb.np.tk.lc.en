we &apos;re doctors .
we are trained to take care of human beings .
and we pretty sure we know what to look for .

i mean , everybody wants kids , and you &apos;re the people .
you wear roller skates for shoes . i don &apos;t get it .
you know what ? i don &apos;t know .
maybe there &apos;s something wrong with me .
&apos;cause it &apos;s not natural . it &apos;s not womanly .
maybe i &apos;m cold and heartless and dead inside .
no , i &apos;m not saying that !
well , yeah . but a little bit , you are .
no . no .
cuts ...
infection ...
genetic mutation .

smushy little ... baby ...
wrapping its chubby little arms around your neck
and breathe in that ...
that intoxicating baby smell .

oh ... oh , the baby &apos;s crying . we can &apos;t go to spain .

tom evans .
tom evans is ... is here ?
you didn &apos;t know ?

excuse me . no , he didn &apos;t .
an evans bypass .
clear your schedule . scrub in .
uh , no , i ... i , uh , i can &apos;t . i ... i gotta go .
and here she is .
your cruise director ... dr. yang .
dr. evans . hi .
hi .
hello . hi . hi . i ... i &apos;m ... cristina yang .
i ... i &apos;m a huge fan .
she &apos;s a groupie ,
but you &apos;re gonna forgive her ,
because she &apos;s one of the finest cardio resident &apos;s
you &apos;ll meet anywhere .
quite a recommendation . are you scrubbing in with me today ?
yes . it &apos;s an honor and a privilege . uh , i ...
here are the patient charts and , uh , the most recent labs .
if there &apos;s anything else you need , just ask me ,
&apos;cause i &apos;ll be around here all day , following you .
um , if ... if that &apos;s okay with you .
uh ... she is a groupie . i like her .
this is my wife , dr. meredith grey .
pleasure to meet you .
likewise . i hear great things .
of course , i hear them from your husband ,
so grain of salt .
dr. yang ?
yes .
all yours .
oh , yes , of course .
the patient is right this way , sir .
think she &apos;s gonna drool on him ?
i think she is .
oh , okay . i gotta go . i &apos;ll see you soon .
is that thomas evans from baylor ?
yes , but don &apos;t get too excited . he &apos;s only here for one case .
oh , are you sure ? because i overheard
chief shepherd discussing the fact
that dr. altman doesn &apos;t have a permanent contract .
so it would actually be a really genius move on the chief &apos;s part
to go in and seize that opportunity to ...
oh , here we go again .
what ?
shut up .
she thinks your husband walks on water .
i don &apos;t .
i don &apos;t . i , um ...
no , i &apos;m ... i mean , it &apos;s ... it &apos;s a professional thing .
it &apos;s , um ... it &apos;s a mentor thing .
he &apos;s ... he &apos;s just my mentor because he &apos;s ...
he &apos;s married ... to you .
and you guys are ... are so great and ,
um , together ... together as a married couple ,
and you ... you ... you are so great .
i , um , i do ... i do think that your husband is brilliant ,
but i &apos;m ... i &apos;m sure that you think that , too , so ...
that &apos;s right .
okay . that , um ...
thank you .
you can see it , right ?
the ... the resemblance ?
it &apos;s a newborn .
it resembles other newborns .
okay . all right . fine .
but you want incontrovertible proof ?
here we go .
look at that .
well , it &apos;s impressive . i &apos;ll give you that .
well , i mean ... i mean , a lot of that swelling is from the birth .
it will go down .
he &apos;s a sloan .
right . he &apos;s a sloan .
what is it ?
trauma choppers .
nice .
hey , could you ... could you hand me my ...
oh , well , okay . good morning .
good morning .
yes , it is . i have a trauma chopper 15 minutes out
and a small window of time
where i can actually practice medicine .
right . plus thomas evans is here .
he is . he &apos;s doing a coronary ...
is he interviewing for my job ?
because i &apos;ve been waiting to hear about
a permanent contract from you , and i haven &apos;t .
and thomas evans is here ...
teddy , temporary contract . you said you were looking elsewhere .
yeah , i ... i was , but i stopped .
i didn &apos;t know that .
oh , i &apos;m sorry . i should &apos;ve told you .
look , i &apos;d be happy to consider you for the permanent position .
consider me ? for ... for my job ?
i had to run a search .
i can &apos;t get caught without a head of cardio .
okay . well , i ... i ... i &apos;d like to be considered .
i &apos;ll throw you in the mix .
hey , the baby &apos;s sleeping .
thank you for ...
everything .
i &apos;m happy to help .
dad .
everything &apos;s fine . the baby &apos;s doing great .
hey , can you grab my bag ?
oh , yeah .
what is all that ?
you ...
did you buy all this for the baby ?
yeah . i figured he was gonna need stuff ,
and i was already in the store .
i mean , i know it &apos;s lame .
all the girl &apos;s stuff was way better .
but boys like army crap , right ?
oh , no . well , that &apos;s a choking hazard .
and , well , he &apos;s a little young for that .
and ... and that .
he &apos;s just a little young .
well , whatever . it doesn &apos;t really matter anyway .
he &apos;s gonna be getting a lot nicer stuff soon .
here . uh , this is the number
for the people that are gonna adopt him ... trish and keith .
can you call &apos; em ?
mark ...
yeah .
do you want me to handle that call ?
no , no . i &apos;ll take care of it .
it was a fishing boat accident and two patients ...
one with a head lac and abdominal pain ,
the other , they said something
about a fish hook being stuck somewhere .
why would they send a chopper for a guy with a fish hook ?
uh , i &apos;m pretty sure they said fish hook , chief shepherd .
okay .
&quot; i &apos;m pretty sure they said fish hook , chief shepherd .
but if i &apos;m wrong , you can spank me . &quot;
shut up .
&quot; oh , chief shepherd , i do hope i &apos;m wrong . &quot;
what do we got ?
uh , i &apos;ve got the son ... head laceration and crush injuries .
the dad &apos;s right behind . let &apos;s go .
okay .
50 @-@ year @-@ old male , penetrating trauma to the chest .
hypotensive in the field , gotten 2 liters of l.r. en route .
big hook !
big hook !
mrs. smitte , when is the last time you took a flight of stairs
instead of an elevator ?
oh , god , it &apos;s ...
it &apos;s been years .
this time next week , you &apos;re gonna do it .
and your grandkids , you have ... you have grandkids ?
two .
they &apos;re not gonna know what hit &apos; em .
they won &apos;t be able to keep up with you .
you mean it ?
i mean it .
he means it .
excuse me . sorry .
oh , hey . come in , come in , come in .
no .
why ?
okay , hold it steady . grey , get in there .
what do we have ?
oh , my god .
here we go .
fishing boat accident .
something fell on him .
and the hook ?
looks like he fell on it .
pressure &apos;s at 68 systolic .
tracheal deviation
and absent breath sounds . get me a 14 @-@ gauge needle .
right behind you .
dad .
what are you doing to him ?
grey , get him outta here .
i &apos;m trying . doug , please .
go on , son . i &apos;m all right . oh , god .
what is that ? what the hell is that ?
dad , i ... i don &apos;t know what happened .
i had the rope in my hand one minute , and ...
doug , doug , come on .
no , i did this . i ... i &apos;m sorry . dad , i &apos;m so sorry .
it &apos;s ... it &apos;s okay . it &apos;s not your fault .
of course it &apos;s his fault !
i was thrown on top of this shark hook
because he let go of the rope .
who the hell &apos;s fault is it ?
let &apos;s leave the hook in until we get him up to the o.r.
i &apos;m feeling a depressed skull fracture .
all right . go ahead and order a head c.t.
right away , chief .
that was the first thing he taught me when i joined the crew .
i don &apos;t know how ...
we didn &apos;t play ball when i was little .
we tied knots . i know how to tie that knot .
doug , you made a mistake . it was an accident .
what if it wasn &apos;t ?
i &apos;ve thought about it sometimes ...
hitting him ... or hurting him .
he pisses me off sometimes and he &apos;s harsh and ...
are you telling us you did this on purpose ?
no , not on purpose . i just ...
i don &apos;t ... i don &apos;t feel so good .
okay , just try to relax . deep breaths .
deep breaths .
okay , uh , grey , order a head c. t. and get a c.t. angio .
i think i saw , uh , some fluid around his spleen .
i &apos;ll do it .
uh , i think there &apos;s some ...
and i &apos;ll just deal with the vomit .
so , um , the nurse says i &apos;m being discharged ?
i have to leave tomorrow ?
i just had the baby , like , today .
well , that &apos;s a good thing . it means you &apos;re doing great .
no complications .
right , little man ?
well , where am i supposed to go ? my mom kicked me out ,
and those friends i was staying with in portland were like ,
&quot; you gotta pay rent or you gotta leave ... &quot;
and ... i can &apos;t pay rent . i don &apos;t have a job .
i don &apos;t have anything .
you can stay with me .
really ?
sure . just until you figure things out .
you &apos;re gonna be okay . sloans are tough .
you hear that ? we &apos;re tough .
maybe we should ... keep him .
do you think you could ?
maybe .
you want to hold him ?
no . i ... i don &apos;t think i know how to ...
do you want to hold him ? he &apos;s pretty great .
look who it is .
hi , baby .
look at that .
you &apos;re a natural .
it &apos;s up to you .
if you think we can do this , raise him ...
together ...
if you think we can , then ...
hey , guys .
he really needs to go to the nursery to be monitored
and get his newborn checkup .
i &apos;m monitoring , and i did the exams .
he &apos;s all good .
mark , when you get a minute , i &apos;d love to have a quick word .
hmm . caught a big one , huh ?
that &apos;s funny .
he &apos;s got a small hematoma .
hey , can i ask you something ?
why did you hire altman ?
what &apos;d you see in her ?
well , what do you see in her ?
i think she &apos;s good . she works hard .
i feel bad even looking .
i &apos;ll feel worse , though , letting a stronger candidate pass us by .
not the feel @-@ good job , is it ?
can &apos;t you give me a little insight ?
no . see , that &apos;d be doing the job for you .
i &apos;m not gonna give you the fish .
you got a big hook in there .
learn to fish yourself .
what kinda life is that ,
living five months at a time on a boat ,
working 20 hours in terrible conditions ?
in 2007 , the c.d.c. marked crab fishing
the most dangerous job in the u.s. , with an annual fatality rate
28 times higher than any other job . what ?
dude , it &apos;s like working with forrest gump .
the kid &apos;s 15 .
he should be doing algebra , going to school dances .
how much you bet he did it ?
what ?
hooked his old man on purpose .
i &apos;d say 70 % , it was an accident , 30 % attempted murder .
what ? karev &apos;s right .
too much nature makes people crazy .
ah , okay . there ... is the tear .
grey , you want to embolize it ?
really ? i &apos;ve never done it before ,
but i ... i read that if you use ...
you want this kid to bleed to death or what ?
don &apos;t analyze everything .
just ... do it .
tell me that you called the parents .
sloan &apos;s having second thoughts .
sloan picked those parents . she asked you to call them .
she was pretty clear .
well , now she &apos;s not clear .
by law , she &apos;s got 48 hours
before the court terminates her parental right .
sloan changed her mind ?
maybe .
that &apos;s great .
no , it &apos;s not .
what , she can &apos;t change her mind ?
people change their minds .
this baby needs parents ,
not an 18 @-@ year @-@ old child
and a father who she met five minutes ago .
shut up !
mark ...
no .
you know , you don &apos;t get to tell me what to do here .
i appreciate your help , but you don &apos;t ...
my mom is dead .
my dad &apos;s never gonna get off the couch again .
i don &apos;t have any brothers or sisters .
this is my grandson ...
my grandson .
i &apos;m not just gonna turn him over to some strangers
when i might have a chance at a family .
so just ... give me a minute here .
how &apos;s he doing ?
his temp &apos;s high . i ... i can &apos;t figure out why .
is his dad in surgery yet ?
yeah , they &apos;re prepping him now .
doug ,
would you like to see your dad before he goes into surgery ?
he &apos;s probably calmed down .
he hates me .
he &apos;s always hated me .
and now i practically killed him .
he doesn &apos;t want to see me .
once when i was little ,
i was really mad at my mom , and ...
i had heard that saccharine can kill you ,
and so ... i swear to god , i almost put , like ,
ten packets of sweet &apos;n low into her coffee all at the same time .
i w ... i was this close .
and while she was thinking of sweetening her mom &apos;s coffee ,
i tried to run my old man over with a car . it &apos;s normal .
no , that &apos;s ... that &apos;s not normal .
those hooks were meant to catch sharks .
he &apos;s never letting me near him or the boat again .
i don &apos;t even know where i &apos;m supposed to go .
ow . ow , my head is , like , pounding .
hey , we should get blood cultures and a repeat c.b.c.
we need to find out why he &apos;s burning up .
you do that , sweet &apos;n low .
i &apos;m gonna go watch them pull out a hook .
the baby smiled at mark .
he looked up and smiled at him like he knew him .
that poor baby &apos;s parents ,
just sitting ...
stop calling them the baby &apos;s ...
that baby &apos;s parents ...
the mature , capable , financially secure ,
emotionally stable , loving parents ,
who were deemed fit by sloan and the state of washington ,
are sitting there by the telephone
staring at the sky blue nursery walls that they just painted .
those are the parents .
not mr. midlife crisis
and his teenage kid
who ... who bought her infant son a bag of lollipops
and juicy couture onesies .
so she has a lot to learn .
no , she doesn &apos;t .
she made the one sound parenting decision she needs to make .
she found a lovely couple to raise her baby .
and she did that months ago ,
when she wasn &apos;t flooded with postpartum hormones
or ... or overwhelmed by heartfelt pleas from her dad ,
when she had time to think clearly ...
about what was right for her and ...
and what was right for the baby .
she made a decision , a good decision .
and it would ... it would
be great if we could just try and respect that .
crap . sloan .
is he okay ?
i ... i don &apos;t know . uh , he won &apos;t stop crying .
well , what happened ?
i ...
i don &apos;t know . i was just holding him ,
when mark was to go get a bottle for him .
and he &apos;s not stopping , and i think something &apos;s wrong .
what happened ?
sloan got worried . she paged us .
but the baby &apos;s fine .
oh , he &apos;s just hungry is all .
no , i ... i don &apos;t know how to do this . i don &apos;t ...
you can &apos;t do it wrong ,
and we &apos;re right here if you need help .
no , no , no , he &apos;s crying .
i ... i don &apos;t think ...
i don &apos;t think he wants me to do it . please .
here . oh , god . i don &apos;t feel so good .
well , you &apos;ve been up all night .
you &apos;re exhausted and dehydrated . drink that .
thought i &apos;d check to see how far along we are .
almost ready to extract the hook .
suction .
after they get him off the hook ,
we &apos;ll go in to evacuate the hematoma
and plate the skull fragments , right ?
no , i thought we &apos;d throw him back in . catch and release .
thank you , dr. kepner .
well , walter &apos;s lucky .
it looks like he doesn &apos;t have to lose any lung .
yeah , no thanks to his kid .
mm .
well , it was an accident . that happens .
that kid shouldn &apos;t have been there in the first place .
well , he &apos;s the guy &apos;s son ... family business .
there &apos;s something to be said for loyalty .
you put a person in a job like that
because they have the skills to handle it ,
not because they &apos;re your friend or your kid .
are you intentionally equating me with the idiot son
that dropped the crab cage on his dad
or is that just a happy coincidence ?
all right . we are to extract the hook from the man .
all right , nobody move but dr. hunt .
on my count .
one ...
two ...
snagged an artery ...
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m ... i &apos;m sorry .
god bless you .
he &apos;s stabilized and ready for you .
i &apos;m sorry .
look , if this doesn &apos;t go your way ,
please don &apos;t take it personally .
you &apos;re an incredible surgeon . i see that .
it &apos;s just that evans has published dozens of times .
he &apos;s won awards .
she won a bronze star for service to her country .
does that not count ?
and the anastomosis is done .
fine suture hook .
you &apos;re not using a side clamp ?
nah .
it &apos;s a special technique .
i get a very clean ...
very nice anastomosis this way .
much less trauma to the surrounding structures .
you just parachuted that vein graft down .
is ... is that to avoid memory in the suture or tangles later on ?
excellent observation , yang .
have you already applied for your fellowships ?
oh , i &apos;m only in third year .
oh , right . i forgot .
it feels like i &apos;m working with a fellow .
thank you .
oh , would you like me to cut the last suture ?
that &apos;s ok . i already got it .
it looks like you &apos;ve barely operated at all .
it &apos;s ... it &apos;s so perfect .
well , that is the goal , dr. yang .
that is the goal .
excellent .
hook guy is stable for now . how &apos;s the kid ?
crappy .
nothing to do now that we &apos;ve finished with the angio .
lexie &apos;s babysitting him .
hey . have you , uh , seen evans ?
it was amazing . who saw ?
dude , you &apos;re like a kid with trading cards ,
except with heart surgeons .
yeah . i gotta have &apos; em all .
i thought teddy was the love of your life .
oh , she is . she is .
but ... evans .. brilliant .
i mean , brilliant .
i mean , so is she . but ... i love them both .
i &apos;m a cardiothoracic whore .
what can i say ? it feels so good .
speaking of whores , has anyone seen
the love @-@ struck intern fawning over my husband ?
april &apos;s not an intern .
you bat your eyes like that , you &apos;re an intern .
oh , don &apos;t worry . that &apos;s not derek &apos;s thing .
anymore .
i was the love @-@ struck intern .
it is his thing .
no , he &apos;s grown out of it .
out of what ,
chicks who shave their legs and laugh at his jokes ?
sure he &apos;s grown out of it .
i shave my legs .
sometimes .
she &apos;s calling him chief sheperd .
i don &apos;t make the rules .
i &apos;m just telling you , it &apos;s a thing .
powerful guys like adoring girls .
look , whatever . do what you want .
that baby &apos;s delicious .
yeah .
i was thinking i could take paternity leave .
you know , at least for a couple of weeks .
i could help sloan get the hang of things .
i don &apos;t know if a couple of weeks is enough .
what ? she &apos;s a good kid . she &apos;s got good instincts .
well , her instincts led her to put the baby up for adoption .
i don &apos;t know .
she &apos;s unformed . she &apos;s a baby herself .
i don &apos;t know .
i don &apos;t know either .
arizona wants to go to spain .
she &apos;s picking a suntan over a family ,
which i don &apos;t get .
didn &apos;t she have , like , a happy , idyllic childhood ?
totally . she talks to her parents every day ,
every day .
part of which could be the brother thing .
what brother thing ?
he died .
her brother died .
and i &apos;m an idiot .
you have a cold .
it could &apos;ve happened to any of us .
yeah , but it didn &apos;t .
it was me
on a day that shepherd is
interviewing evans for my job .
and i &apos;m the new girl here who no one really knows .
and even yang ... is in love with evans .
and i
i have a freaking cold .
it &apos;s okay .
you &apos;re gonna be okay .
okay , what happened ?
he became lethargic and febrile , coughed up blood .
his sats dropped out .
his x @-@ ray shows there &apos;s
a large hemothorax where we took the hook out .
all right . well , then we &apos;re gonna have to go back in .
the repairs must not have held .
you should get a c.t. to confirm
before cutting into a patient that &apos;s unstable .
there &apos;s no time for that .
you wait , and he could go
into multi @-@ system organ failure .
shepherd , you have to trust that i know what i &apos;m doing .
i &apos;ll call up to the o.r. let &apos; em know you &apos;re coming .
yes , this is chief shepherd .
we &apos;re gonna need a cardiac o.r.
you paged me . hey , what &apos;s up ?
doug has fever and rigors ,
and he &apos;s starting to get a productive cough .
so deal with it .
look , hook guy is tanking . he coughed up blood or something ,
so they &apos;re taking him back to surgery . i want in .
wait . he ... he coughed up blood . what did it look like ?
was it like currant jelly ?
did he have leukocytosis with a left shift ?
his paco2 was 28 , right ?
i don &apos;t know , encyclopedia brown .
i didn &apos;t memorize the chart .
let him go , grey . he has a surgery he wants to see .
thank you , dr. bailey .
dr. bailey , both patients have
productive coughs and signs and symptoms of sepsis .
i am probably wrong ,
but if i &apos;m not , this is infectious .
you &apos;re probably not wrong . you &apos;re probably right .
why do you want to hand your big save over to karev ,
who &apos;s gonna march around the hospital acting like he put it together ?
i didn &apos;t . i ...
you are handing your power over to a boy
because he &apos;s giving you sex .
i &apos;m not . i ... i ...
i &apos;m dr. bailey . i know everything .
and you have a superpower .
that memory of yours is a superpower .
and on top of it , you &apos;re a good doctor .
and yet , you &apos;re letting
alex karev treat you like a scut monkey .
i don &apos;t care how good the sex is .
if that &apos;s what it costs , you &apos;re paying too much .
i &apos;m ... i &apos;m not ...
scut monkey , all day .
doctor .
thank you .
i was right .
i know ,
now what are you gonna do about it ?
karev , what &apos;s the status on your patient ?
temperature spiked , but the dude &apos;s doing fine .
we &apos;re running new labs .
dr. altman , stop .
dr. grey , you always shout at people
right before they start operating ?
doug has klebsiella pneumonia .
and i &apos;m guessing walter here does , too .
we need to start to imipenem , stat ,
or things could get ugly fast .
klebsiella ?
it &apos;s highly contagious in close quarters ,
like living on a crab boat for months at a time .
and i think that hemothorax is a mixture of blood and an empyema .
thanks for the heads @-@ up .
yeah , well , you were busy .
maybe we should open him to check anyway .
no , i , um ...
i ... i think i was wrong here .
get him out of the o.r. , into the icu now .
this day has to end .
oh , tell me about it .
i was supposed to watch tom evans work .
meanwhile , i got stuck in an o.r. all day
watching teddy altman decompose right in front of my eyes .
i don &apos;t understand . what &apos;s tom evans doing here ?
taking a look around .
why ? you don &apos;t need evans . you got teddy .
i don &apos;t need teddy if i &apos;ve got evans .
what ? no , you ... you can &apos;t .
me and ... me and teddy , w ...
oh , god . see , this is my point exactly .
i can &apos;t staff this hospital , based on the fact
that she &apos;s hunt &apos;s friend and your flavor of the month .
you know what ? i &apos;m just sick of worrying about this .
this job is exhausting .
i &apos;m sorry . that &apos;s what you &apos;re complaining about ?
screw you .
i &apos;m losing everything today .
everything !
go ahead .
how am i supposed to call a couple of strangers
and tell &apos; em to come take my kid ?
sloan &apos;s your kid , mark .
you &apos;re not losing her .
they &apos;re not taking her .
hey ! did you see me in the o.r. ?
you &apos;re an idiot .
what ?
you really think that evans is gonna take you under
his award @-@ winning wing ? he won &apos;t .
he doesn &apos;t need you . he doesn &apos;t care about students .
he &apos;s a rock star , not a teacher .
he is a rock star .
teddy , he &apos;s totally a rock star .
i mean , did you see him in there ?
he was like an octopus doing a million things ,
like cutting , retracting , suctioning all at once .
you think that i need you to
hold my instruments when i operate ?
you think that helps me save the patient ?
i do it so that you can learn , cristina .
i &apos;d be a lot faster in the o. r. without you .
did you notice ? your gloves were
totally clean at the end of surgery .
did you learn a lot ?
teddy , it was one surgery .
he &apos;s here for my job , cristina .
do you really not get that ?
if evans is in , i &apos;m out .
so , you know , good luck with your new attending .
i get it .
you watch parents go through horrible ...
unimaginable pain , every day .
and ... you went through horrible ,
unimaginable pain when you lost your brother .
and your parents never got over it .
but if we had a baby ...
our baby &apos;s not gonna be
one of those kids in your nicu .
our baby won &apos;t be your brother .
i mean , knock on wood , but ...
do you know how happy our baby would be ?
i &apos;m gonna say this once ,
and then i &apos;m not gonna say it again .
i &apos;m not broken . i &apos;m not some psychodrama .
my lack of interest in having a child is not some persology
you can pat yourself on the back for having diagnosed .
i like my life . i like it the way that it is .
i don &apos;t want it to change .
i thought i liked it with you in it .
i hope i &apos;m not wrong .
wait .
i called your mother .
what ?
why ? she kicked me out .
she &apos;s on her way . she misses you .
she &apos;s worried about you .
right .
i &apos;m worried about you , too .
okay ,
if this is the part where you tell me that you talked to her
and she convinced you that me keeping my baby was a bad idea
because i &apos;m young and irresponsible ...
that &apos;s not what the conversation was about .
okay , well ... so you thought it over
and you decided that you don &apos;t have time for a kid ?
that &apos;s fine . i get it . you have a life . you &apos;re busy .
but you know what ? i can handle this kid on my own .
no , you can &apos;t .
having a kid is hard .
and you are young and irresponsible .
and keeping him is probably a bad idea .
but if that is your decision , if that &apos;s what you want ,
then i &apos;m in . i &apos;m all in .
i &apos;m not too busy for my family .
but ...
don &apos;t keep the baby for me .
you &apos;ll always have me .
and i &apos;ll always want you .
and that &apos;s true no matter what you decide .
you &apos;re my kid .
and i &apos;m so happy ...
i get to know you , sloan .
i &apos;m so happy about that .
what are you doing right now ?
can we walk and talk at the same time ?
where are we going ?
you need to talk to derek shepherd about teddy
and why replacing her with evans would be a huge mistake .
remember , be persuasive and strong .
use a lot of words .
cristina , i am not 12 .
i &apos;m not saying that you &apos;re 12 ...
dr. yang , good work today .
thank you , dr. evans .
this is important .
shepherd .
hunt .
look , before you say anything , i just want you to know
that i think , uh ... she &apos;s a fine surgeon .
evans is interested ?
yeah , i think so .
well ...
well , evans is good . he &apos;s really good .
and patients would come here from all over .
that would be ... that would be good for this hospital .
well , i &apos;m glad you feel that way .
yeah , and teddy has a lot of connections ...
mainly on the east coast , so she &apos;d be fine .
if that &apos;s what you decide ...
she &apos;d be fine .
thank you .
all right , walter . i need you to squeeze my hands .
all right . let &apos;s do a little push against them .
not bad , all things considered .
you like being captain ?
do i like it ?
no .
me neither .
you know what it beats , though ?
it beats not being captain .
come here , son .
you ok ?
this was my fault .
and i &apos;m sorry .
thanks , dad .
now just remember ,
the sloans , we bloom early .
so when you start to grow hair on your face , don &apos;t be shy .
live it up .
all the other guys will be jealous .
and it &apos;s okay to rub it in a little bit .
but not a lot .
you don &apos;t want to be considered too full of yourself .
no one likes a vain guy in the locker room .
mark .
oh , my god .
is that him ?
hey there .
hi there , little guy .
he &apos;s so beautiful .
this is ...
and , this ...
thank you .
he has your dad &apos;s chin .
what ?
that &apos;s crazy .
come in .
chief shepherd ...
are you busy ?
did you just call me chief shepherd ?
i did .
go with it .
what are you doing with the shades ?
shh . no one can know .
no one can know what ?
about our secret love , chief shepherd .
our secret love ?
by the way , chief , i picked up your dry cleaning for you .
and i ...
had your car washed .
and i dusted off your desk ...
... with my bottom .
is there anything else i can do for you , chief shepherd ?
let me see if i can come up with a list of things .
oh , chief shepherd .
give me a beer .
you screwed me today . that was my patient .
you made me look like a moron . get your own beer .
you ... you can &apos;t be an ass to me all day
and then expect me to give you respect .
you can &apos;t be an ass to me all day
and then expect me to give you sex .
and you can stop with the patronizing nicknames .
i am a nice person who
couldn &apos;t even bring myself to attempt matricide by sweet &apos;n low .
that makes me charming to anybody else .
i am a nice person and i am nice to you .
so whatever your damage is ,
you better start to be freaking nice to me ,
or i am not spreading my legs for you anymore ,
no matter how much i may want to .
now give me a damn beer .
as doctors ...
we have an arsenal of weapons at the ready ...
my cousin &apos;s baby punched her in the face .
literally .
she had a black eye from a 1 year old .
who needs it , right ?
i don &apos;t need that .
they scream , they &apos;re grimy ,
they ... smell like poop , and the house smells like poop .
don &apos;t .
don &apos;t .
don &apos;t .
antibiotics to kill infections ...
narcotics to fight pain ...
tell me you &apos;re staying .
please .
i &apos;m staying .
okay .
okay .
scalpels and retractors to remove tumors and cancers ...
derek .
to eradicate the threat ...
i heard you gave teddy a contract .
yes , i did .
well , i &apos;m glad . it was the right move .
loyalty ... it &apos;s a powerful thing .
it makes for a great chief .
i offered it to evans .
he passed .
but just the physical threat .
for every other kind ...
you &apos;re on your own .
