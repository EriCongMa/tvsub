i &apos;m sorry . i don &apos;t mean to overstep , but i don &apos;t know
that this movie is really appropriate for children .
i &apos;m terrified to see it . that &apos;s why we &apos;re here during the day .
it &apos;s okay . we &apos;re good .
okay .
i tried .
yeah . all you can do .
you know , i &apos;ve--i &apos;ve read this book ,

who wouldn &apos;t shut up .
just leave .
第三季 第五集
hello ?
i &apos;m running late .
this knucklehead &apos;s kept me waiting for over an hour .
i never had to wait like this when his dad was running things .
yeah .
and soda was a nickel .
just tell them that your family is coming over .
this guy fired his own father .
he &apos;s not gonna care about my family .
okay , then just leave .
you don &apos;t need his money .
once a week , i have eight family members
coming to my house for free food .
i &apos;m not going anywhere .
okay . i see you when i see you .
are you okay ? what is wrong ?
i want to be homeschooled .
really , manny ? do you want me to learn you english ?
what is going on ?
i have a big report due ,
and the teachers don &apos;t seem to care about the substance .
all they care about is the flash .
manny , sometimes you can be a little bit old @-@ fashioned .
remember the first time
you saw the kids with the backpacks with wheels
and you thought they were too flashy ?
you &apos;re going to school , not boarding a flight to denver .
it &apos;s getting absurd .
reuben freestyle @-@ rapped his report on irish immigrants .
that doesn &apos;t even make sense .
maybe you do a riverdance . maybe .
what is your report on ?
the mafia .
perfect . we do a papier @-@ mache tommy gun .
oh , no . we shouldn &apos;t have to jazz it up .
okay , then we go upstairs and we get your old rocking horse
and we chop the head off .
no , that &apos;s a terrible idea . i love brownie !
do you want to send a message or not ?
jay never wants me to help him with his business ,
and now suddenly , manny doesn &apos;t want to listen to me either .
it &apos;s very frustrating .
i have all the answers .
hey ! there he is .
bring it in , jay . how you doing , joshie ?
it &apos;s josh now .
have a seat .
ah , all right .
so i flipped through your proposal ,
and here &apos;s the thing--
we &apos;re about to build our largest luxury condo complex yet .
and i have an important question for you--
what is it you want to build ?
closets .
see , i was kinda hoping you &apos;d say &quot; dreams . &quot;
i thought that was implied .
jay , i &apos;m looking for closets nobody &apos;s ever seen before ,
you know , a big &quot; wow ! &quot;
you know what i &apos;m saying ?
you want a nice closet with sharp design ,
quality materials , and expert craftsmanship .
uh , i mean , i want it to be like , bam !
you know , people are gonna walk in there and go
&quot; whoa ! what do i hang first ? &quot;
i wanted to hang myself .
yeah , let &apos;s talk more specific .
what exactly do you like and what don &apos;t you like ?
all right , fair enough . uh ...
i don &apos;t like this . this makes me sad .
i do like getting my mind blown .
i love your enthusiasm .
uh , before i go off in the wrong direction ,
how about an example ?
all right , check this out .
so , like , three weeks ago , i &apos;m down in south beach .
i walk into this thumpin &apos; club .
bartender says , &quot; what do you wanna drink ? &quot;
i say , &quot; wow me . &quot;
he mixes this thing together . i take one sip ,
and i &apos;m like , &quot; hello , nurse ! &quot;
and she &apos;s like , &quot; you &apos;ve been unconscious for two days . &quot;
that &apos;s what i want in a closet .
i don &apos;t think i need to hear any more .
whatcha doing there ? homework ?
what do you want ?
i need to borrow some money . it &apos;s really important .
how much ?
$ 900 .
what ? !
come on . if you were in trouble ,
i would do anything for you .
we &apos;re not just sisters .
we &apos;re best friends .
look , i would if i could ,
but i don &apos;t have any money .
and since we &apos;re talking ,
i never told anyone this before , and it ...
... wipe that smug smile off his stupid face .
his face is stupid .
oh ! i can &apos;t believe ridiculous people like him end up in office .
well , why don &apos;t you run ?
you &apos;re smart , you care about the community ,
and you &apos;re easy on the eyes when you put a little effort into it .
are you serious ?
yeah , you know ,
maybe change out of the sweaty gym clothes every once in while .
i thought you were talking about running for office .
go on .
i &apos;d be lying if i said i &apos;d never thought about it .
i mean , i know it &apos;s a ridiculous little local thing ,
but it might be fun to get out there and contribute .
plus i think i &apos;d be good at it .
you &apos;d be great .
mm . how would this work ?
i mean , who would be here for the kids after school ?
who would take them to practice and recitals
and keep them from burning the house down ?
it must be so hard being a single mom .
claire , i will .
if you wanna fly ,
i &apos;m not gonna hold your feet to the ground . hmm .
i wanna be the one to push you off the cliff .
i think i &apos;m gonna do it .
great .
go fly .
phil .
no .
oh , phil !
i &apos;ll admit it . i &apos;m turned on by powerful women--
michelle obama , oprah , condoleezza rice ,
serena williams--
wait a minute .

no , i can &apos;t eat .
we should &apos;ve stayed and seen &quot; the muppets . &quot;

and i understand that i can pick up a form here .
fourth floor .
elevator down the hall .
beyonce , when &apos;d you start working here ?

i am entering the race for town council ,
and i am running against you .
oh . well , don &apos;t you have pluck .
no , i plan on winning , so ...
oh , yeah , i bet you do .
marcia ! rocking the bangs ! love it .
do you know why , of all the dogs in the world ,
i breed puggles ?
why do i feel like this is a rhetorical question ,
and you &apos;re about to l--
it &apos;s because they &apos;re lovable , yes ,
but they &apos;re also tenacious hunters who won &apos;t quit
until the kill is complete .
really ? &apos; cause i feel like they just yip a lot .
look , lady , you &apos;re going down .
i &apos;ve won six straight elections .
i don &apos;t plan on losing to some bored housewife ,
so don &apos;t quit your lack of a day job .
excuse me !
excuse me !
excuse me .
hello ?
anne .
haley did that ?
oh , god . okay . um ...
i &apos;ll call you right back .
for your information , sir ,
i am no bored housewife .
no , i @-@ i would kill for &quot; bored . &quot; why isn &apos;t this lighting up ?
oh , it &apos;s because it &apos;s , uh , staff only .
yeah .
here . allow me to ...
not get that for you .
good luck !
dad , i cut my arm .
oh , wow . you sure did , buddy .
i &apos;ll get you fixed up .
where &apos;s mom ?
she belongs to the people now .
my allergies are acting up again .
well , it is your lucky day ,
because , missy ,
dr. dad has everything you need .
behold the healing powers of grape flavoring .
where &apos;s mom ?
some people took her .
drink this .
listen , guys , your mom is taking on more responsibilities
outside of the ... house ,
but don &apos;t you worry .
good old ... dad-- oh , my goodness !
i &apos;m so sorry !
you punched me !
dad , you gave me the drowsy kind .
there &apos;s a drowsy kind ? !
i have to study for a test !
oh ! it really hurts !

no . no , no , no .
i &apos;ll get it .
oh , you made it . how was it ?
why ? what &apos;s wrong , babe ?
i don &apos;t want to talk about it .
do it anyways .
uh , this stupid kid &apos;s been in the business about ten minutes .
he barely looks at my proposal ,
and he says he wants more &quot; wow . &quot;
what does he mean by more &quot; wow &quot; ?
it &apos;s the &quot; bieber @-@ ization &quot; of america .
what do beavers have to do with anything ?
the beavers--they build the dams all over the country
so there &apos;s no floods ,
is the &quot; beaver @-@ ization &quot; of the americas .
i &apos;m finding there &apos;s less and less we can talk about .
so why didn &apos;t you tell him
that you &apos;ve been in the business for such a long time--
it &apos;s not gonna make any difference .
he wants to make a change .
and i got a factory full of people depending on this .
yeah , but maybe if you tell him that -- - gloria , please .
i @-@ i @-@ i &apos;ve had a tough day .
can we please not talk about it ?
but i want to help .
trust me . i wish you had the answers .
i do !
hey , guys .
hey , grandpa .
hey , jay .
what &apos;s with her ?
just tired . growth spurt .
hi , guys .
hi , baby girl .
hola , lily . how are you ?
dads are fighting .
no , uh , we &apos;re not fighting .
no , not at all , honey .
no . okay , uh , go play , sweetheart . okay ?
let &apos;s go play with some blocks . let &apos;s go stack some blocks .
all right . okay , the reason we &apos;re fighting
is &apos; cause this one thinks he &apos;s dirty harry .
having a hard time picturing clint eastwood in that shirt .
okay , let me ask you something .
today , at a stoplight , a guy ran into our car ,
and then just took off .
i wanted to chase after him . mitchell ...
kept a level head and called the police .
pfft . police . aren &apos;t they too busy winning the war on drugs ?
okay , so which one of us did the right thing ?
hit and run . gotta chase him down .
i chase the people all the time .
no . no . that &apos;s--that &apos;s irresponsible and dangerous .
okay , well , what if he had been armed ?
he wasn &apos;t armed . he had a hillary bumper sticker .
this isn &apos;t an isolated incident .
this morning he flipped out at somebody at the muppet movie .
you saw the muppet movie without me ?
oh , no .
no , honey . just the first two numbers .
no , lily . wait .
hi . hi . hi . phil , where are you , honey ?
i need to talk to you . do you know what our daughter did ?
nothing . she &apos;s fine . she &apos;s reading .
no , not her . haley . haley !
come over here . i want to talk to you .
there she is .
not a scratch on her .
do you have something you want to say to us ?
uh ...
mm ... let me help you out here .
fake id &apos;s ?
what ? !
mm @-@ hmm .
haley tried to get her and her friends some fake id &apos;s .
i wasn &apos;t gonna use them for drinking .
we just wanted to get into this club to see a band .
she took a bunch of money from them and then she lost it .
how much ?
$ 900 .
oh , my god ! oh !
you &apos;re kidding me !
it &apos;s not my fault !
i gave money to this guy . he &apos;s the one who ripped us off .
what happened to your face ?
oh . i ran into a door .
yeah .
what happened to your face ?
dad hit me .
it was an accident .
phil !
i was trying to open up a band @-@ aid !
what &apos;s wrong with her ?
growth spurt .
what &apos;s wrong with her ?
i drugged her .
phil !
i accidentally gave her the nighttime allergy medicine .
mm . all right , one thing at a time .
haley , how are you going to repay your friends ?
i don &apos;t know .
i know . you go there with a couple of guys--
she &apos;s gotta get the money back . who is this kid ?
a guy at school &apos;s cousin &apos;s friend . he lives in gardena .
well , if you know where he lives , just call the police .
no cops . we can &apos;t afford a scandal right now .
claire &apos;s running for town council .
that was before ,
when i thought you could take care of the children .
i take my eye off the ball for one minute ,
and i &apos;ve got one in a coma , one with a black eye ,
and one running a crime ring .
well , to be fair , haley started her crime ring
when your eye was still on the ball .
it &apos;s not a crime ring .
i just gotta get my hands on that $ 900 .
i know how the mafia would handle this .
the kid is right . i &apos;m sick of these smart @-@ ass punks
who keep changing the rules
and think they can get away with anything they want .
i &apos;m gonna pay this guy a visit .
haley , text me his address .
i &apos;m going with you .
me , too .
oh , no . no . nobody &apos;s going anywhere .
okay , we &apos;re not vigilantes .
shotgun !
no ! no weapons !
in my country , it is tradition
when the men are out seeking vengeance ,
the women--they stay home , and they drink .
sometimes i think you just make this stuff up .
do you want a drink or not ?
oh , yeah .
so what happened ?
you were running for office , and now you &apos;re not ?
mm . i don &apos;t really want to talk about that .
i know . i am sick and tired of no one needing my help .
you are going to tell me what is wrong ,
and i &apos;m gonna give you the right answer ,
because i have all of them .
so why are you not running for office ?
because my family needs me too much .
you saw what just happened .
why are you not running for office ?
that doesn &apos;t work on me .
why are you not running for office ? !
because i don &apos;t want to lose !
i--pfft !
i haven &apos;t done anything outside of my house in 18 years .
i don &apos;t want the first thing i do to be a complete failure .
okay .
i &apos;m gonna tell you a story about a little girl
who entered a beauty pageant ...
even though she was very , very scared that she was going to lose .
let me guess . you won .
of course i won ,
but i was talking about my cousin maria conchita .
she had a nose like a toucan .
she stuffed her body in this bikini .
and at the end , she finished dead last .
how is that a good story ?
because she faced her fears , and it didn &apos;t kill her .
what killed her two weeks later was a bus .
are you serious ?
yes , because she couldn &apos;t see anything coming with that big nose .
this guy has won six elections .
i am way out of my league .
look , i don &apos;t know anything about this guy ,
but i know that you &apos;re a tough lady ,
and i come from a family of tough ladies .
and i have to say , sometimes you scare me a little bit .
and i know that you &apos;re strong enough to win
and definitely strong enough to be okay if you lose .
i scare you ?
are you kidding me ?
i want thanksgiving at my house !
why does everybody think i talk like that ?
this is it .
w @-@ w @-@ wait . no , no . come on . do we have a plan ?
it doesn &apos;t seem like we have a plan .
yeah , i got a plan . either he gives us the money ,
or he gets a private performance from england dan and john ford coley .
that &apos;s not a good plan . that &apos;s not even a good band .
if all you &apos;re gonna do is criticize , just wait by the car .
okay , fine .
i &apos;ll see you in jail .
it &apos;s gonna be a big adjustment for two of you .
yeah ?
you peter ?
what do you want ?
you know haley dunphy ? you owe her $ 900 .
we &apos;re here to collect .
you dig ?
i tried to call that girl , like , ten times ,
but her voice mail was always ... full .
that does sound like haley .
so how are you gonna make this right ?
you guys want the money , right ? that &apos;s fine .
i don &apos;t need any hassle . hold on .
i &apos;ll just ... grab it .
that was easy .
he &apos;s lucky he didn &apos;t put up a fight .
i would &apos;ve treated him to a reunion of crosby , stills , nash , and young !
we got a runner !
runner !
stop ! stop !
stop !
no . no . no .
no .
i got him !
oh , my god . you did !
don &apos;t be so surprised .
help ! he &apos;s slipping out of his skinny jeans .
these are cute . i totally have these .
there you go !
oh , you got it back ! thank you !
hey , don &apos;t thank me . thank your uncle mitchell .
he &apos;s the one who tackled the guy .
i got grass stains .
well , i will tell you one thing .
i have learned my lesson .
disappointing my family and friends
is punishment enough .
nice try . you &apos;re grounded for two weeks .
okay , we have big news .
claire has decided to run for mayor after all .
thank you , but it &apos;s town council .
it doesn &apos;t matter . you &apos;re not going to win anyways .
but she &apos;s going to be okay . you see ?
i help the people .
why don &apos;t you two let me help you ?
well , i can &apos;t speak for jay ,
but i guess i &apos;m just too proud to ask for help .
are you serious ? she cuts your steak .
what about you ?
i don &apos;t want to bother you with my business .
what else do i do every day ?
i don &apos;t know . i &apos;m guessing the gym .
and ... one other thing ?
dad , you should listen to her . she might really help you .
she could be an asset .
asset .
heard it .
and look at the shelves over here .
they &apos;re for the shoes . those are my favorite ones .
so what do you think ?
wow !
same ... exact ... closet .
we never needed fake i.d.s on the farm .
we figured if a 16 @-@ year @-@ old could drive a tractor ,
he could drink a beer . not at the same time , of course .
it &apos;s missouri , not texas .
i used a fake i.d. to get into an &quot; r &quot; -rated movie--
&quot; the fabulous baker boys . &quot;
i found the title to be misleading .
lot of michelle pfeiffer-- that &apos;s all i &apos;m saying .
i remember when i got my fake i.d.
me , too . crazy times .
hell , yeah . i tried to enlist in the army ,
but they saw right through me , so me and a bunch of guys
drove across state lines , we got a bunch of booze .
we loaded up on fireworks , and i woke up in the morning--
i kid you not-- in a mexican strip joint .
you ?
uh , i used mine to rent some bowling shoes and kept &apos; em .
suckers probably spent months
trying to track down dr. richard hertz .
