don &apos;t ask .
don &apos;t tell .
it &apos;s probably obvious , anyway .
i was up all night crying .
let &apos;s see if she &apos;s here . gloria ? !
sarah fink , my lab partner
who i hoped one day would be my love partner .
i caught one of my so @-@ called friends hitting on her ,
and now she &apos;s like the fetal pig
we once so happily shared --
cold , unresponsive , heartless .
you got two choices --
you can mope your way up those stairs and soak in a pity bath ,
or you can pick yourself up , march into that school ,
and act like you don &apos;t even know that girl .
thanks .
if mom asks , i borrowed her tub pillow .
jay , don &apos;t forget to drop joe at mitch and cam &apos;s later .
yeah , what time are they expecting me to , uh --
oh , what the hell ?
oh , isn &apos;t it cute ?
last night when i went to do my nails ,
the girls did it just for fun .
what &apos;s fun about a lifetime of gender confusion ?
ay , please .
it &apos;s the same as when you took him to the dodgers game
and you brought him back with that dodgers cap .
you think ? or is it different in every conceivable respect ?
ay , and don &apos;t forget that phil is gonna be meeting you
at mitch and cam &apos;s
to help you bring lily &apos;s princess castle here .
she &apos;s outgrown it , but joe loves that thing .
ay , don &apos;t make that face .
you &apos;re gonna bring it , right ?
sure , honey .
okay . hold him .
i picked a fine time to run out of lavender bath beads .
i wanted two rough and tumble boys .
i got a manny ...
and a pedi .
she &apos;s my first girlfriend , really .
this time tomorrow , she &apos;ll be in our living room ,
if we can fit her through the doorway .
okay , i feel like i have to ask .
dad &apos;s about to buy a &quot; miss pac @-@ man . &quot;
ms. what was our struggle for ?
and not just any &quot; ms. pac @-@ man , &quot;
but an original 1982 fully reconditioned podium @-@ style unit .
with original coin return .
they &apos;re even throwing in the stool .
come on !
oh , you know , you &apos;re right . it &apos;s stupid .
just be taking up space we need
for things we actually use , like the piano -- oh , wait .
what &apos;s going on with you ?
oh , i have a throbbing headache .
it &apos;s making it hard to ...
pretend that you &apos;re sick ?
yeah , you just ate a bushel of cereal .
check the structural integrity of the trophy case , bitches ,
&apos;cause mama &apos;s bringing home some hardware !
awards day at school --
the one day of the year alex has some real swagger .
ironically , the one thing she &apos;s not good at .
when i say &quot; trophy , &quot; you say &quot; trophy &quot; !
trophy !
trophy !
can i get a wha @-@ what ?
what ?
i always worried that alex winning all those awards
would bother luke , and looks like it finally did .
can &apos;t be easy growing up in the shadow of a superstar sister .
look at mitchell .
okay , do you have any queens ?
yeah , two big ones .
okay , you know what ? it was funny the first time .
now it &apos;s just getting mean .
what was that ?
mr. polasky , our upstairs neighbor , died last week .
he was 93 , and he &apos;d been sick for a while .
yeah , and we -- we tried cheering him up
with a &quot; get well &quot; sign in the front yard .
okay , how &apos;s that look ?
looks great .
honestly .
oh . no ! no .
&quot; get well son &quot; ?
okay , well , you know what ?
&quot; soon &quot; seemed a little bossy anyway .
mitchell and i have always discussed
trying to buy the place
in the event something happened to stan .
we -- we could use the extra space for a guest room
or an office or maybe even ...
a nursery .
i think i may want another child .
but i don &apos;t want to bring it up to mitchell
and put pressure on him
because he &apos;s been so adamant about not wanting one .
the last thing he &apos;s thinking about is a ...
nursery .
lately , i &apos;ve been having stirrings ,
but because it was such an emotional roller coaster in the past ,
i don &apos;t want to bring it up
unless i have some sort of indication ...
that we &apos;re both on the same page .
that &apos;s why , when gloria asked if we &apos;d watch joe ,
i said &quot; sure . &quot;
it &apos;d be a chance to remind mitchell
how nice it is to ... have a baby .
claire dunphy .
what can i do you for ?
oh , it &apos;s not so much what you can do me for .
sounded a -- a tiny bit prostitute @-@ y .
i &apos;m sorry about that .
actually , i do have a tiny favor to ask .
you know , i love your family .
i mean , haley , our homecoming queen .
yeah .
and now alex winning just about every academic award .
i know .
it &apos;s been an honor to teach the dunphy children .
well , today i &apos;m here to talk about luke .
is that the science rabbit ?
that &apos;s my son .
yes . of course .
that &apos;s sort of the point .
i think he &apos;s feeling a little bit overlooked .
i was wondering if you could just ,
you know , toss him one of those awards today .
just ...
well , i &apos;m afraid all of the award winners
have already been decided .
oh , but , hey , if it makes him feel better ,
he was in the running for the integrity award .
he just got edged out by --
scott wheeler ?
oh , that little weasel &apos;s a narc .
halloween carnival , 2008 --
&quot; mrs. dunphy &apos;s grape juice smells like medicine . &quot;
it was a long morning .
it would mean so much to him .
well , claire ...
that wouldn &apos;t be fair .
i know . i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m so sorry .
i @-@ i @-@ i really am -- so embarrassing .
maybe there &apos;s some sort of , um --
i don &apos;t know , like , a -- a -- a donation or something
i could give to the auto shop to , um ... grease the wheels .
we &apos;re good on grease .
but you can never have too much brake fluid , so --
or perhaps the soccer team could use some new cleats ,
help them get their ...
kick back ?
okay , mrs. dunphy , i &apos;m really doing everything i can
to ignore the fact that you &apos;re trying to bribe me
for the marlon boniface integrity award .
i &apos;m so glad you can remember that name ,
but you can &apos;t remember luke .
my first day off in a month ,
i &apos;m headed out the door to go shopping with gloria ,
and my stupid boss needs me to pick up some stupid orchid .
like my time &apos;s not valuable ?
gloria was gonna help me pick out a toe ring .
oh , i don &apos;t care if you are here illegally ,
you &apos;re gorgeous .
listen , mister , for your information , i am --
flower . he &apos;s talking ... flower .
gavin , i would like to introduce you --
where are the photos from the milan show i asked for ?
i @-@ i don &apos;t remember you asking for them .
oh . i guess one of us is mistaken , but who ?
the fashion icon profiled by vanity fair
for pioneering a new sock length ,
or the part @-@ time employee who shares a stapler ?
sorry .
sorry , sorry , sorry . here they are .
oh , look what &apos;s new for fall .
thumbprints .
do you know the thai , german , argentine , mexican
gourmet food truck back to basics ?
yes .
i need you to make me a standing reservation there .
how do i make a standing reservation ?
parking &apos;s a bitch .
i need you to go there , find a spot ,
and stand in it until i arrive .
i wanted to kill him .
but i bite my tongue , because in this family ,
they think that i am a colombian hothead ,
which is crazy because a colombian hot head is
when you set somebody &apos;s head on fire .
it smells terrible , but it sends a message .
go somewhere else .
it &apos;s me -- gloria .
what are you doing ? i told you to go shopping without me .
i couldn &apos;t enjoy it knowing you &apos;re standing there
like a little orange cone .
it &apos;s my job . it &apos;s fine .
no , it &apos;s not fine . he &apos;s a terrible man .
but i did a little something to make you feel better .
oh , my god , what have you done ?
he messes with something i love --
i mess with something he loves .
the second it goes missing ,
he &apos;s going to check security cameras ,
and i &apos;m going to get fired .
so what ?
he &apos;s the worst person i have ever met ,
and there was a man in my village
named flavio the baby puncher .
hey , cone . move .
okay . um , just -- just leaving .
hello ?
faster .
i &apos;d already been caught trying to bribe the principal ,
but believe it or not ,
i was still trying to think of a way
to get luke that award .
then i saw scott wheeler .
yeah , he was a narc and a goody two @-@ shoes ,
but he was also just a child .
and i knew the right thing to do .
sometimes all it takes is a little nudge .
what ?
he is so adorable .
i know , isn &apos;t he ?
remember when lily was like this ?
what do you say when i &apos;m not here ?
joe , let &apos;s show mitchell
how you can catch and throw the ball .
let &apos;s see .
is this so that i &apos;ll learn ?
oh , yes -- well , no , but , i mean ,
if you pick up on it , that &apos;d be great .
well , no , actually , here --
joe , let &apos;s show cam how we can dance , huh ?
i love a dance party .
oh , there we are . i like this beat .
should i join you ?
yes , of course .
okay , if you insist .
oh , how fun is this ?
so fun .
you look so happy .
you look so happy .
no , seriously , i wish you could see
the happy look on your face .
well , if it &apos;s half as happy as the look on your face ...
mitchell , are we almost discussing
what i think we &apos;re almost discussing ?
i want to have another baby .
i do , too .
i just was afraid to say anything .
i was , too .
i -- but the timing seems right , right ?
i mean , we both seem to be on the same page .
i @-@ i just really miss having a baby around .
the writing &apos;s on the wall .
but mostly on the curtains .
oh , boy , okay .
oh . all right . that &apos;s fine .
there &apos;s water underneath the seat there if you want it .
those guys at the loading dock
really gave me the business
when they found out i was hauling a princess castle .
something was bugging him . he needed to talk .
it &apos;s like i don &apos;t want to be happy .
well , you &apos;ve obviously got something on your mind .
claire and i had a thing .
oh , you &apos;re just gonna make fun of me .
no , i promise i won &apos;t make fun of you .
i &apos;ve always wanted a &quot; ms. pac @-@ man &quot; machine ,
but claire said no .
actually , she didn &apos;t say anything .
she just made a disapproving noise , and i rolled over .
pretty wimpy , huh ?
no . i &apos;ve been there .
really ?
you have to sometimes .
that &apos;s the way marriages work .
all this happy wife , happy life sort of stuff .
tell you what would make me happy .
this bad boy right here .
it &apos;s still in my shopping cart
cause i just can &apos;t say goodbye .
who doesn &apos;t want a happy life ?
but soon you &apos;re saying , &quot; yes , dear , &quot;
and , &quot; whatever you need , dear , &quot;
without even thinking about it .
anti @-@ glare plexi , reinforced podium .
stand up every once in a while , you lose all your power .
it &apos;s even got a wrist pad for your knob hand .
before you know it ,
you &apos;re picking up a pink princess castle
for your pedicured 2 @-@ year @-@ old ,
saying goodbye to your last chance
to have one red @-@ blooded man in the family .
and you &apos;re getting that damn game , phil !
what in the name of &quot; pac @-@ man &quot; creator toru iwatani
have you done ? !
you deserve it .
you work hard . you provide for your family .
no regrets .
you know what ? i don &apos;t regret it .
of course you don &apos;t .
i &apos;m the owner of a &quot; ms. pac @-@ man &quot; !
this is exhilarating !
thanks , jay .
you know , every now and then ,
i wonder how you really feel about me .
bup bup !
i &apos;m sure you &apos;d do the same for me .
gotcha .
good .
message received .
good .
what the hell did you do ? !
i thought you sent me a message !
have you lost your mind ? !
thank god it &apos;s still in one piece .
we can probably--
okay , dummy .
we get this thing in the backyard ,
we nail it together ,
and gloria will never find out .
don &apos;t do this , jay .
as your best friend , i implore you .
if we rebuild this castle ,
we tear down everything we built today .
what ? and what ? !
we stood up for ourselves .
there &apos;s no turning back .
we &apos;re going to tell claire and gloria what we did .
i &apos;m scared , phil , okay ?
they count on that fear . they feed off it .
no more .
someone &apos;s looking sexy and sweaty .
that &apos;s right .
and this sexy , sweaty someone
is now the proud owner of a vintage &quot; ms. pac @-@ man &quot; game .
oh , it came ?
they promised they weren &apos;t gonna deliver it until tomorrow .
i wanted to be there to see your face .
it was killing me this morning
when you said you wanted to get your own .
do ya love it ?
love , i love you .
jay ?
what took you so long ?
joe &apos;s gonna be here in 30 minutes .
what happened to the castle ?
little snafu .
about this princess castle--
what &apos;s that ?
black paint and a skull flag
so that we can turn this princess thing
into a pirate castle .
pirate castle ?
yes . he &apos;s a boy .
we have talked about this .
why do men never listen ?
it &apos;s always , &quot; sure , honey . sure , honey . &quot;
i don &apos;t know . marriage is hard .
okay , we can solve both our problems .
we put this princess castle together in the next 30 minutes .
let &apos;s go !
how does that solve my problem ?
just go !
oh , my gosh , what happened ?
joe took lily &apos;s car for a little spin .
had a little fern @-@ der bender , but it &apos;s okay . it &apos;s fine .
well , the curtains he drew on
are gonna need to be professionally cleaned ,
but they were overdue .
yeah . it &apos;s fun having this energy back in the house .
it is . where is that little pudding @-@ filled rocket , anyway ?
oh , there he is . there he goes .
you see him ?
okay , yeah , he &apos;s going into the bathroom .
okay . oh . it &apos;s locked .
locked ?
i &apos;m gonna go around to the other door . yeah .
joe !
joe !
okay , well , that &apos;s gonna clog .
all right , i &apos;ll get the plunger .
okay , now , sweetie , listen .
we can &apos;t use that much toilet paper
because it &apos;s wasteful .
oh , my gosh . my keys .
no , no ! no ! no , no , no !
oh , good , it didn &apos;t clog .
okay . oh , geez .
lily , did you spill purple paint on the floor ?
yeah , i &apos;m the problem today .
oh , geez .
oh , god ! the vanderkolff !
what ?
oh , god , the vanderkoff !
it &apos;s okay . it &apos;s okay . it &apos;s okay .
we &apos;ll , we &apos;ll just get it professionally cleaned .
yeah , w @-@ we &apos;ll just throw it in with the curtains .
ball !
oh , no , that &apos;s not a ball .
no . no , no , no . that &apos;s a criminally expensive santangelo bowl .
okay , i &apos;m gonna sneak around behind him
snd you &apos;re just gonna keep him talking .
joe , you don &apos;t want to do this .
you know , as of right now , you haven &apos;t done anything wrong .
you just hand that over to me ,
and it &apos;s like nothing ever happened , see ?
okay , he &apos;s not baby face nelson . he &apos;s an actual baby .
okay , you know what ? you want to help out ?
slide something underneath it like a throw pillow .
throw !
you forget what a handful kids are when they &apos;re little , huh ?
yeah , i didn &apos;t realize how easy we have it
now that lily &apos;s so independent .
yeah .
plus , we &apos;re not as young as we were when she was like this .
mitchell , are -- are we almost discussing
what i think we &apos;re almost discussing ?
maybe we shouldn &apos;t rush into having another kid ?
it &apos;s a big decision , and i love the way our lives are now .
oh , god , me , too !
th @-@ th @-@ this doesn &apos;t make us selfish people , does it ?
of course not .
baby joe &apos;s stuck in the well .
leave him .
he &apos;s fine .
no , no , no . a little bit more to the left .
what are you doing here ?
i can &apos;t believe i have to beg you to go shopping .
well , i have to make sure
that you &apos;re putting that thing in the right place
since this stupid , horrible job is so important to you .
ay , haley , i have to say ,
today i lost a little bit of respect for you .
goodbye , gloria .
you need to learn how to stand up for yourself .
do you know how easy that is for you to say ?
no , no . nothing in english is easy for me to say .
unlike you , i don &apos;t have a rich husband .
what i do have is a reputation for being a screw @-@ up
who never follows through on anything .
which is why , in case you haven &apos;t noticed ,
i &apos;m in my third year of a two @-@ year college program
and still living in my parents &apos; basement .
look , i know that this job sucks ,
but it might actually lead to something .
do you know who had this job five years ago ?
gavin , and he worked for an even bigger jackass than he is .
hey ! that was a quick lunch .
yeah , the line was too short .
it &apos;s over . i can &apos;t be seen there .
i wouldn &apos;t want people to think i was a jackass .
uh , look , when -- when i said that ,
i really didn &apos;t --
okay , first of all , you were just leaving .
second of all , maybe permanently .
faster .
you know what , gavin ?
i have had enough of -- - no .
what ? why not ?
it &apos;s time i stood up to this guy .
i &apos;m probably gonna get fired ,
so i might as well get in a couple shots before i lose my dental .
no , you were right before .
it &apos;s very easy to be like me ,
to scream first and think later .
but that &apos;s not how the world works .
let me go talk to him .
no .
yes .
i caused all this .
anyways , it &apos;s good for me every once in a while
to swallow my pride .
what do you want ?
i just want you to listen to my voice
and look into my eyes and ask yourself ,
&quot; did this woman made it all the way here from colombia
without knowing some very bad men
who would love to do her a favor ? &quot;
okay . i don &apos;t know what &apos;s gonna happen next ,
but it feels so good to apologize .
oh , my god , i still have my job .
oh , that &apos;s great ! let &apos;s go celebrate .
oh , you know what ? i can &apos;t .
i have to go spread seeds on his front lawn
so he can run through birds when he gets home .
i have one more thing that i need to apologize for .
call me the periodic table , &apos; cause i got all the &quot; metals . &quot;
that &apos;s nice , honey .
luke , how was your day ?
well , luke won the boniface integrity award ,
whereas i got all --
are you kidding me ?
that is fantastic !
i &apos;m so proud of --
the bonerface !
you win that award , everyone calls you &quot; bonerface . &quot;
it &apos;s the super nerd award .
my underwear got pulled over my head by a girl .
it always goes to scott wheeler ,
but someone pushed his car into a handicapped spot
so i &apos;d get the award .
and i think i know exactly who did it .
well -- - manny !
you framed scott wheeler so i &apos;d win the bonerface .
it adds up .
first , lower your voice . we &apos;re not stevedores .
second , you &apos;re wrong .
third , it serves you right , anyway ,
after you hit on sarah fink .
oh , for god &apos;s sake .
there are plenty of other girls out there .
get over it .
that cinnamon stick is from srillanka !
get off me !
you smell like a candle .
it &apos;s lavender bath beads , you son of a bitch !
and the award for the saddest brawl goes to
okay , stop it ! stop it ! stop it ! stop it !
i did it ! i did it ! i got you the bonerface !
ugh the bonifa-- what &apos;s it called ?
just get out of here .
you ?
yes .
why ?
because i didn &apos;t know it was a nerd award .
i just knew it was an award , and i wanted you to have one .
and you were second in line to get it , anyway ,
so i just , you know ...
rigged it because you think i &apos;m a loser
who could never win his own award ?
no . no .
i @-@ i just ...
alex has her awards and
thanks for believing in me .
joe &apos;s gonna be here soon .
let &apos;s pick up the pace . window looks good .
let &apos;s raise the roof .
i don &apos;t think it &apos;s time to celebrate , jay .
we haven &apos;t even put on the roo-- oh .
honey .
i am so sorry .
you just seemed so upset this morning ,
and i assumed it was about awards day and alex .
i don &apos;t even care about awards .
then why didn &apos;t you want to go to school ?
this isn &apos;t still about that fight
that you &apos;re having with manny over sarah fink , is it ?
i don &apos;t even like sarah fink .
i told her to stop calling me .
well , then why does manny think that you &apos;re ...
you didn &apos;t hit on her . she hit on you .
and you &apos;re -- you &apos;re trying to spare manny &apos;s feelings .
i am the dumbest person in the world
to think that you would ever need my help
to win an integrity award .
i could not be prouder .
maybe next year , alex .
okay . awning is done .
supposed to be a drawbridge .
weren &apos;t the chains a clue ?
a lot of criticism
from a guy who just sawe1d half his shoe off .
who are we kidding ?
we got a wall on backwards .
i don &apos;t even know where that stuff goes .
it barely looks like a --
castle !
joe , wait !
hey , buddy .
hey , it &apos;s gonna look even better when it &apos;s painted .
ah , the awning &apos;s a nice touch .
jay , this castle &apos;s supposed to look like so --
oh , my goodness !
oh , joe , look what you did .
do you expect me to believe
that a 2 @-@ year @-@ old can destroy a whole house in one second ?
oh , wow , yes .
easy .
for sure .
jay , do you want to tell me what really happened ?
no one wins anything
without help from family and friends
who steer you away from bad ideas ...
wait , phil ! phil ! phil !
... and toward good ones .
i don &apos;t know what got into us today .
oh , with the baby thing ?
yes . it &apos;s the last thing i need right now .
it &apos;s the last thing any of us need right now .
yeah .
because every time anyone accomplishes anything ...
he or she achieves it ...
nice .
... with the help of a thousand silent heroes .
the selfless team players who offer their support ,
not to be recognized ,
but because it &apos;s the right thing to do .
awards aren &apos;t usually given out
being a good person , but today ...
they are .
ladies and gentlemen , the winner
of the marlon boniface integrity award is ...
this is awesome .
luke dunphy .
no !
alex dunphy .
wow , this is a surprise .
let me tell you about a little girl with a dream .
muchas , muchas gracias .
where was i ?
awards day ...
or as sanjay patel knows it , passover .
all that little girl wanted
was a calculator and a chance .
