when my mother left my father ,
she didn &apos;t tell him she was leaving
and taking me with her
until we &apos;d landed on the other side of the country .
in those days , it was called family troubles .
today it &apos;d be called kidnapping .
could you page dr. shepherd one more time ?
i paged him two minutes ago .
it &apos;s really very important
that i speak with him right away .
he &apos;s a brain surgeon . everyone looking for him
thinks it &apos;s really very important .
i &apos;ll let you know when he calls back .
sir , you know how i said i wanted to do a gunther today ?
i sent you an e @-@ mail with my new screening criteria
for my clinical trial .
did you get a chance to look at it ?
not yet . uh , torres has a patient from the sinkhole .
she would be perfect for--
you know , i &apos;m inserting an islet cell device this afternoon .
i &apos;d like you to be there ,
see how it works , okay ?
oh , no . you &apos;re gonna do a hundred of &apos; em .
can i see the next one ? today &apos;s just not a good day--
i &apos;d like it to happen today .
no , sir . the fifth years are at each other &apos;s throats .
and it &apos;s affecting the work .
i almost pulled a spleen out of a man with a hole in his lung .
i need you in this surgery .
i can &apos;t have you supervise a gunther .
torres can supervise . it &apos;s her patient .
who doesn &apos;t love a gunther ?
fine . do a gunther .
but be in my o.r. by 4 : 00 .
4 : 00 . okay . come on . go .
cristina .
what are you doing ?
oh , bailey paged 9 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 .
well , what happened to the chest tube ?
an intern &apos;s doing it &apos; cause it &apos;s intern &apos;s work ,
which i love .
i &apos;m--i &apos;m loving
the back @-@ to @-@ the @-@ basics thing .
it &apos;s so valuable , but , uh , 9 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 , so ...
hey .
oh , and you have to go .
so no worries . we &apos;ll talk later .
i had such a good attitude today ,
and now it &apos;s gone .
dr. webber called .
he &apos;s gonna put the thing in .
now ?
at 4 : 00 .
wait . they just call-- why would he do that ?
i don &apos;t know , but i &apos;m not complaining .
i just want the damn thing over with .
so i &apos;ll , uh ... i &apos;ll call you when i &apos;m in a room .
okay .
okay
bye .
bye .
you see that ?
i wish i did . i can &apos;t see anything .
hold the nerve root retractor .
it &apos;s yours again , dr. shepherd .
why is my pager going off every 30 seconds ?
gloria &apos;s checking on it .
his s.s.e.p.s are coming up .
there &apos;s still a lot of epidural bleeding .
dr. shepherd , when you have a second .
does it look like i have a second ?
what the hell is the problem ?
they said it &apos;s something about your baby .
she was pinned under her car ,
her leg was amputated in a pit of dirt ,
her abdomen is pulp ,
and her pelvis is probably crushed .
you will work together
to assess her injuries and repair them .
oh , in the o.r. ?
no , at the jiffy lube . yes , in the o.r.
now dr. torres will supervise your work .
if you &apos;re killing her , she will step in .
otherwise , you &apos;re on your own .
don &apos;t screw this up
like you screw everything else up you &apos;ve touched lately .
ladies and gentlemen ,
step away from the patient .
is she--is she here ?
she is ,
and as soon as--
i want to see her .
hey , hang on . we need to check you out first .
does she know about her leg ?
she &apos;s unconscious .
all right ? i &apos;ll go and see how she &apos;s doing , okay ?
hey , lie down .
i will see how she is doing .
i &apos;m gonna get someone to take you to c.t.
and then i will come back with a full report .
okay ?
okay .
all right .
it &apos;s an open book pelvic fracture .
and a comminuted femur fracture .
has anyone fully examined the stump ?
pneumopericardium and an enlarged cardiac shadow .
she needs a chest tube and a c.t.
free fluid . she needs the o.r.
an embolization and angio
would help stabilize the pelvic bleeding .
an angio &apos;s just gonna waste time . we could pack her in the o.r.
call the o.r. tell them to
prep for an emergent laparotomy .
hello ? a c.t.
excuse me .
i &apos;m telling you guys ...
oh , no , no .
something is going on with her heart .
what do you mean , no ?
that &apos;s my patient .
we &apos;re doing a gunther .
what the hell &apos;s a gunther ?
it &apos;s , uh , like a team @-@ building exercise .
see , the hospital does it
when the residents aren &apos;t working well together .
it seems to help .
if the patient doesn &apos;t die . one time , the patient died ,
and then it didn &apos;t help at all .
oh . um , so what , they , uh , prep her and then--
uh , no , no , no . no attendings . just the bunnies .
in the o.r. ?
yes , the o.r. why does no one seem to get that part ?
no , no . not this patient .
i just pulled her out of a hole in the ground .
that almost ate her alive .
and her husband had to cut off her leg .
dr. torres will be there every step of the way .
bailey !
they can handle this .
i said no .
the chief said yes .
i &apos;m sorry .
oh , yeah ? who died and made you god ?
okay , look , i think what we need to do is ,
we just need to take a moment ...
april , you &apos;re chief resident not chief of surgery .
did somebody call the o.r. ?
no , because she needs a c.t. to assess her cardiac injuries .
what did i say about ...
no one gives a crap what you have to say .
still want to take her to radiology ?
maybe wait in line for a little while till the machine &apos;s free ?
is somebody gonna call the o.r. ?
they &apos;re still finding their groove .
you &apos;ve reached dr. meredith grey .
i can &apos;t ...
let &apos;s check the liver first . it &apos;s the most likely source .
what ? no .
hey , yang . where &apos;s meredith ?
i don &apos;t know .
she &apos;s in cardiogenic shock . that &apos;s our main concern .
yang .
they fired her .
maybe she &apos;s putting anthrax in karev &apos;s locker .
b.p. &apos; s tanking . we need to up her fluids .
no . her pericardium is filled with air and blood .
do you listen to anyone else , ever ? all the time . just not you .
or me , apparently .
she &apos;s not answering her phone or her pager .
i haven &apos;t seen her . i was in the pit . she &apos;s not in the pit .
i was in the elevator . she &apos;s not in the elevator .
page dr. grey .
i just did , sir . she didn &apos;t answer--
page her again .
chief .
henry just told me that
you called him in to insert the device today .
yeah . i had an opening .
well , but he hasn &apos;t had his pre @-@ op labs
and he hasn &apos;t had ...
well , we can rush the labs . it &apos;ll be fine .
well , but he could come in in a week .
i mean , it just seems a little weird to race him in here ...
look , it is a simple procedure . it &apos;ll be over in an hour .
don &apos;t worry about it .
dr. bailey .
i wanted to keep an eye on the gunther .
an intern just pulled me ...
i need you now .
you need to spend some time with the mice .
this is why i left my gunther ?
once you put a couple of devices in mice ,
putting one in a human &apos;s a breeze .
all that space .
sir ,
i have a full schedule
that i already had to take apart
so i could watch you put this thing in a person
this afternoon .
henry . altman &apos;s husband .
i would like to keep an eye on the gunther ...
put on a mask , dr. bailey .
even with mice , you need a sterile field .
this ...
is mouse t.
he &apos;s skinny .
so it won &apos;t be easy .
get yourself some gloves .
danny , you have a little bit of blood in your brain ,
so i &apos;m gonna have one of my colleagues
take a look at your films .
is it bad ?
it &apos;s probably nothing ,
but i just don &apos;t want to take any chances .
did susannah wake up ?
they &apos;re starting her surgery now .
and she does have some internal bleeding
that they need to repair .
well , and wh @-@ when will ...
when will you tell her about her leg
after the surgery ?
we &apos;ll just see how it goes , all right ?
but , but , i @-@ i ... will she be able to feel it ?
i mean , what if--what if she sees it ...
danny ...
and nobody &apos;s told her ?
her leg is not the big problem right now , okay ?
she just needs to get through the surgery .
but she has ...
an incredible team working on her .
really , they &apos;re ... unbelievable .
give me a 10 @-@ blade , please .
don &apos;t give her a 10 @-@ blade .
the woman just had her leg hacked off .
she doesn &apos;t need her chest cracked open
for something we &apos;re not even sure she has .
yeah , well , i &apos;m sure , and if her heart craps out ,
she &apos;s not gonna give a rat &apos;s ass about her leg .
look , we know that she is bleeding from her pelvis and her abdomen ,
which gives her plenty of reason to be hypotensive--
let &apos;s just do an x @-@ lap and see what we &apos;re dealing with .
no !
karev , start the incision .
w @-@ why him ? just because you &apos;re pissed that i &apos;m chief resident
doesn &apos;t mean that you can pretend i &apos;m not here .
nobody cares that you &apos;re chief resident .
can everyone just shut up , please ?
we are wasting time arguing .
the only logical conclusion is , take care of the heart first .
hey , how is the e.r. still a zoo ?
no , they got everyone who survived out of the hole a while ago .
it &apos;s quieted down .
she got the crossword down there ?
sudoku . you ever try it ?
bores the crap outta me .
amen .
who do you think the gunther is ?
what do you mean ?
is this your first one ?
the name gunther comes from the doctor , not the patient .
one of the residents always kind of emerges
as a leader when they do this .
and the first time , it was this little quiet guy named gunther .
and everyone thought he was gonna flame out of the program ,
but it turns out , he &apos;s the alpha dog .
great .
we know it won &apos;t be avery . he doesn &apos;t have any balls .
well , karev &apos;s got the balls , but everyone hates him .
so i don &apos;t really see them following his lead .
bound to be yang .
i don &apos;t know . kepner &apos;s kind of a dark horse these days .
you feel good about that position ?
you willing to back that up ?
what , like , 50 bucks ?
bring it .
how are they doing ?
still trying to agree where to start .
i just had to put an islet cell device ...
in a mouse .
do you know how small a mouse &apos;s omentum is ?
i &apos;m gonna go with really small .
up the dopamine to 15 .
happy now . she &apos;s bottoming out .
well , if we &apos;d get in there and pack the pelvis ,
that alone will help the blood pressure , right ?
well , yeah , i hope so ,
&apos;cause her systolic &apos;s down to 68 .
because her heart is exploding .
okay ...
is this where i step in ?
we need to stabilize the internal bleeding .
and then we can get a t.e.e. while we &apos;re in there ...
yang ! what are you doing ?
opening her chest . what does it look like ?
rib spreader .
oh , my god .
we &apos;ll have these lab results back in a few minutes ,
then you &apos;ll get a happy cocktail ,
and they &apos;ll take you up to the o.r.
i mean , his glucose levels aren &apos;t spiking or anything ?
no .
i mean , nothing that would make you want to push this up ?
nothing . we got an opening ...
opening , right . okay .
are you nervous ?
no .
she &apos;s nervous . it &apos;s kinda cute .
all right . i &apos;m--
i &apos;m--i &apos;m gonna go .
i love you so much .
and you have made me ...
so happy .
i mean , like ...
like really , really happy
for the first time in my life , i think .
are you saying good @-@ bye ?
no . no . no .
&apos;cause you--you keep telling me , this is a simple procedure .
it is . it is .
it--it &apos;s--it &apos;ll ...
it &apos;ll--it &apos;ll-- it &apos;ll be fine .
yeah , but that sounded like ,
&quot; and if i never see you again , remember i love you . &quot;
it did .
i should go .
i think it &apos;s a good idea .
it &apos;s a rim subdural .
片中病人的颅ct中显示右侧硬膜下有典型的半月影
it &apos;ll probably reabsorb .
i &apos;m not that concerned . you should keep an eye on it .
good .
everything all right ?
meredith disappeared with zola .
wh @-@ what do you mean , she disappeared ?
she ... had a rough day .
she probably just went out for a walk .
derek , there are a hundred possible explanations .
don &apos;t assume the worst .
you know why i do that ?
because lately ,
the level of insanity in my wife &apos;s behavior
defies imagination .
i know , but sometimes-- even with cristina--
sometimes , they surprise us .
got some bleeding in the upper right quadrant .
give me more suction and lap pads .
do you see any bile or pancreatic secretions ?
none here .
negative .
hey , i &apos;m watching henry &apos;s surgery today .
why ?
&apos;cause the chief loves an audience .
not because he &apos;s worried that something &apos;s wrong
and he--he wants you there to help ?
i don &apos;t think so .
have his accu @-@ cheks been bad ?
no , but he wasn &apos;t supposed to be in surgery
for another two weeks ...
and then this morning , he calls henry up
and has him race into the hospital--
he &apos;s getting batty in his old age .
oh , well , that &apos;s great ,
&apos;cause he &apos;s cutting open my husband today .
i &apos;ll be standing there , contemplating my mortality .
if the batty acts up , i &apos;ll lend a hand .
something is not right .
you know what you sound like ?
a wife .
cardiac rupture , like i said .
a lot of bleeding down here .
jackson , help her hold pressure there .
lap pads down in there , please .
looks like yang &apos;s the gunther .
yep . no surprise .
what does that mean ?
it means she took over while everyone else
is standing around looking like idiots
doing whatever she says .
i mean , look at avery . useless .
i gotta go . kepner .
what was i thinking ?
more lap pads over here .
oh , no . no , no . this is the opposite ...
of what she should be doing .
i &apos;m trying to teach her some humility ,
and she &apos;s running the o.r. on a massive trauma .
what can you do ?
some people are racehorses . she &apos;s a racehorse .
v @-@ fib .
i need the paddles .
charge to 20 .
clear .
no change .
okay , i need 1 of intracardiac epi .
someone take over massaging the heart .
i got it .
oh , my god .
oh , my god . oh , my god . alex ?
look at me .
alex , look at me . alex ?
oh , my god , alex !
what the--
alex !
racehorse ?
my bad .
what the hell just happened ?
epi . give me another epi .
here you go , doctor .
i can &apos;t find a pulse .
why the hell doesn &apos;t he have a pulse ?
i need a crash cart .
an epi doesn &apos;t stop a healthy person &apos;s heart .
what did you do ?
i don &apos;t know .
all right . her heart &apos;s back .
i &apos;m gonna deal with the pericardium .
forget about the pelvis for now . she &apos;s bleeding
through the packing in the right upper quadrant .
should i repack it ?
try a pringle maneuver .
graft , please .
get me and dr. altman gowned and gloved ,
and i need something to stand on .
dr. bailey , it &apos;s under control .
we got a lot of hands in here ,
and two more surgeons
are only gonna confuse matters .
i &apos;m gonna ask you to step back , please .
can i get another pledgeted 3 @-@ 0 prolene ? suction .
v @-@ fib . charging to 200 .
clear .
alex ?
alex ?
can you hear me ? alex ?
you crazy bitch .
you almost killed me .
i called home . i scoured the hospital .
i even had an intern
call every e.r. in the city
to make sure she wasn &apos;t run over by a bus .
there &apos;s no simple explanation .
why don &apos;t you let me handle talking to nicky &apos;s dad ?
i don &apos;t mind .
i &apos;m fine .
how is he ?
there were three fractures in nicky &apos;s spine .
we repaired the damage .
looks like , neurologically , he &apos;s intact .
this is the &quot; wait and see &quot; part .
can i see him ?
he &apos;s in recovery right now .
they &apos;re not gonna let you see him .
i can &apos;t believe that this is happening .
we were just walking down the street ,
talking about why people don &apos;t have gills .
i was holding his hand ,
and he just ...
slipped away .
how do you go through the day when one minute to the next ,
your child could just ...
excuse me .
i &apos;m sorry .
he &apos;s ...
let &apos;s go find nicky .
i thought you said , they weren &apos;t gonna let me see him .
well , we &apos;re gonna figure something out .
you need to see your son .
don &apos;t touch me .
i &apos;m not touching you .
don &apos;t touch my gurney !
all right , get this artery . see right there ?
yeah .
good . now do a tie on the hemostat .
who &apos;d have thunk it ?
avery &apos;s the gunther .
what the hell happened ?
yang almost killed karev ,
and avery &apos;s the gunther .
avery ?
get outta here .
hand to god .
avery .
good job , son .
thank you .
i &apos;m right here if you need anything .
damn it .
my guy won .
we &apos;re gonna be great together .
sorry .
a little hiccup in the gunther .
take your time .
you know , i &apos;ve seen you open an abdomen before
whereas dr. grey--
i don &apos;t want an observer . i want an assist .
oh , okay . is something wrong ?
no , this is a teaching hospital .
and you &apos;re not too old to learn .
yeah , but it &apos;d be good experience
for grey to see--
dr. bailey , if wanted a resident &apos;s help ,
i &apos;d ask for it .
here you go , doctor .
thank you .
whenever you &apos;re ready .
all right , then get back to me with her post @-@ op crit .
and make sure you &apos;re aggressive
with the dressings on her leg .
i &apos;m still worried about an infection .
okay .
you know why she just did what he said , right ?
because he &apos;s the gunther .
how did it go ?
we &apos;ll have to go back for definitive repairs ,
but we stopped the major hemorrhaging ,
got the leg all cleaned out .
good
nice work today , avery .
thank you .
i just hope she pulls through .
how &apos;s alex ?
he should be fine .
apparently ,
he had an underlying arrhythmia ,
so the epi ...
i was moving too fast and i made a mistake .
you think ?
boy , you got a mean streak .
i mean , you look like a nice girl , but ...
scratch the surface ...
don &apos;t mess with the nice ones .
i think i stole a baby .
okay , first of all , you didn &apos;t steal the baby .
she &apos;s your baby .
what you did is ,
you took her for a nap ...
in a very odd location ,
and you failed to answer your phone .
but , you know , many people find all the technology
in our lives to be intrusive .
so you &apos;re not the first person who didn &apos;t answer her phone
or her pager .
well , and , you know , all we have to do is--
is find a reason why you were awol for an hour .
four ...
hours .
janet was gonna take the baby , so ...
i took off .
okay . okay .
you know , people make mistakes .
i mean , i almost killed alex
in the o.r. today .
so we &apos;ll just figure it out .
how ?
i don &apos;t know .
no .
how &apos;d you almost kill alex ?
with a c.c. of epi .
what @-@ whatever . you know , he &apos;ll be fine .
just , um ...
just stay here . i &apos;ll fix this .
what are you gonna do ?
i &apos;m gonna fix it .
hand me a 10 @-@ blade , please .
okay .
have to be careful not to cut too deep
into the omentum .
dr. webber .
yes .
hi . teddy altman here .
yeah , nice to see you .
i @-@ i thought that dr. bailey was just observing .
yeah , well , she &apos;s here , so she &apos;s gonna make herself useful .
dr. webber , i &apos;m a surgeon .
that &apos;s the word on the street .
you have an attending assisting you
in a simple subcutaneous device insertion .
you rushed henry into surgery with an hour &apos;s notice .
what ... wh @-@ what are you not telling me ?
dr. altman--
is there something that he didn &apos;t tell me
about his checkups ?
i mean , is--is--is his hba1c too high ?
here we go .
look , i am a doctor
and i know when something is wrong ,
and something is wrong .
dr. altman , i &apos;m fond of you ,
so i &apos;m gonna count to 30 in my head
before i call security .
richard , i &apos;m--i &apos;m just asking you--
get out of my o.r. right now .
i don &apos;t need to be here .
they just want to observe me
and make sure i don &apos;t pass out again .
not a bad idea .
how &apos;d the kid do ?
he has a few spinal fractures ,
but it looks like he &apos;s out of the woods .
you need to make up with your friends .
whatever .
one of them almost killed you today .
it was an accident .
nobody has your back .
nobody is looking out for you .
that &apos;s when accidents happen , okay ?
this isn &apos;t a personal problem . this is a professional one .
it makes you a bad hire .
also , it means that i have to worry about you ,
because no one else is .
and i don &apos;t want to worry about you .
i &apos;d much rather be kicking your ass on my peds ward .
cristina .
do you want to sit and talk for a minute ?
i do . i ...
i really very much do ,
but i have to go do something right now ,
and it can &apos;t wait .
please ...
please believe that i want to talk to you
and i &apos;m not blowing you off because i &apos;m a terrible person
or because i don &apos;t care about you .
none of that is true .
she okay ?
uh , no change .
i just ...
i don &apos;t want to mess this up
like i messed up everything else .
what ? you were great in the or .
i wasn &apos;t the gunther .
i was a super @-@ duper assistant .
are they gonna fire me as chief resident ?
no .
it was your first day .
they &apos;ll just ...
make you do it again .
it &apos;s time to place the device .
what do you want me to do ?
place the device .
sir , is there anything you want to tell me ?
don &apos;t screw it up .
a surgeon doing the early stages
of human trials on his experimental procedure
never hands over the reins
to someone else , ever ,
unless something is wrong .
altman said this was weird ,
but i just thought she was being a wife .
bailey ...
are you drinking again ?
ooh , that would explain a lot .
yes , it would . god , i wish it were that simple .
pick up those forceps , dr. bailey .
now watch the superficial arteries .
that &apos;s where it gets dicey .
let &apos;s get more retraction , dr. grey .
right . okay . don &apos;t--don &apos;t-- don &apos;t rush it .
all right . you see those blood vessels ?
yep .
implant the device as close to those as possible .
without their oxygen supply ,
the islet cells would die off .
good .
and eventually the vessels
will just take over the oxygen delivery
to the device completely .
look at that .
it &apos;s interesting , right ?
it &apos;s actually kind of beautiful .
nice work , dr. bailey .
close him up .
did--did--did he just ...
he just left ?
get up .
no . i &apos;m under 24 @-@ hour observation
because you almost killed me !
i revealed an arrhythmia you didn &apos;t know you have .
i probably saved your life .
i &apos;ll run an ekg on you later . just get up .
you &apos;re supposed to have my back .
i made a mistake .
all right ? i @-@ i @-@ i was drunk ,
i was pissed off--
oh , for the love of--
no , i screwed up ! you screw up all the time .
i don &apos;t have anybody . you guys are all i have .
you have to forgive me !
fine !
whatever . forgiven .
just ... get up out of the damn bed .
oh , sorry . i was paged here .
that was us .
we paged your wife , too . do you know where she is ?
well , that is the question of the hour .
i have no idea where she is .
well , we &apos;ll fill her in later .
shut the door , please .
dr. webber just informed me
that he tampered with the drugs and placebos
in your clinical trial .
excuse me ?
n @-@ no .
it was , uh ... meredith .
dr. grey apparently was covering for him .
she knew and she ...
was trying to protect him .
you have my apologies .
i destroyed your trial .
she wasn &apos;t covering for you .
what the hell are you doing ?
i &apos;m protecting your wife . what are you doing ?
this is wrong , and you know that .
what are you trying to do to her ?
she was trying to save adele . she was trying to save me .
at what point are you gonna stop punishing her for that ?
and there &apos;s no pain in your abdomen ?
nope .
really ? or are you just being stoic for me ?
i &apos;m a man in a gown .
i can &apos;t pretend to be brave and strong .
you can .
i kinda lost it today .
dr. webber kicked me out of the or .
really ?
okay , um , so ...
you know how we both figured that since i was a doctor
that ... i would be really calm
while you were having your surgery ?
mm @-@ hmm .
that may not be the case .
you &apos;re just a mess , like any ordinary wife would be ?
yeah , it &apos;s pathetic .
i think it &apos;s adorable .
i have a chronic tumor condition .
i &apos;m a frequent flyer in the o.r.
i &apos;m gonna be a basket case every time .
so sad .
uh , if you &apos;re headed in there , you may want to wait .
they &apos;re acting like
he just came back from the wars .
what ?
something happened with the chief .
where have you been ?
we &apos;ve been trying to reach you for hours .
i &apos;m sorry .
where &apos;s zola ?
hey . susannah just got out of surgery ,
and it went as well as it could have .
we &apos;re not gonna know much for a little while .
okay .
look right here .
we had such an awful fight right before .
i ...
i brought up her mother in an argument ,
and th @-@ that--that is one of the red buttons .
i swore i would never do that .
why--why did i do that ?
she &apos;ll forgive you . you saved her life .
maybe for a while , and then she &apos;ll get better
and she &apos;ll remember why she got out of the car .
maybe she won &apos;t . you know ?
maybe you both just decide to forget , move on ...
pretend it never happened .
does that work ?
it can &apos;t hurt to try .
you married ?
i @-@ i &apos;m sorry . it &apos;s-- it &apos;s not my business .
i didn &apos;t mean to pry .
oh , that &apos;s all right . yes .
yes , i &apos;m married .
what did you do ? !
i want you to shut the door
and then i want you to sit down .
you &apos;re throwing your whole career away
for that damn girl ?
this is not the end of my career .
the fda will never come anywhere near you again .
that is the end of your islet cell trial ,
not to mention any other thing you might be cooking up with
the fda--
sit down !
you ...
open it ...
what ...
and read the first page .
&quot; the artificial pancreas : a cure for diabet-- &quot;
how about &quot; the artificial pancreas :
&quot; a @-@ a huge missed opportunity that you blew
because you-- &quot;
read the next line .
&quot; principal investigator : miranda bail-- &quot;
it &apos;s yours now .
i have no pending trials with the fda .
ever since her surgery , zola &apos;s had weekly blood tests ,
and , uh , the results i got today
were a little weird , so i wanted to take a look at her .
yeah , and , you know , with babies ,
i mean , when a doctor calls--
i got worried ,
so i just rushed her right in ,
and i must have left my phone in the day care center .
and your pager .
my pager i had to turn in because they fired me .
what &apos;s wrong with her ?
her white count was elevated .
14.5 . um , i wanted to make sure there wasn &apos;t
a post @-@ op infection or a c.s.f. leak or something .
um , on my exam , she looks fine .
no signs of spinal shock .
i re @-@ ran her c.b.c. ,
and her white count was 8 .
totally normal .
must have just been a stress reactant ...
or a fluke in the labs , &apos; cause , uh , well , she &apos;s fine .
it &apos;s true .
c.s.f. leaks are a problem with spina bifida babies .
that &apos;s ... that &apos;s great you caught that .
i &apos;m sorry . i didn &apos;t mean for any of this ...
i didn &apos;t mean for any of this to happen .
i know . i know .
i still don &apos;t understand
what you possibly could &apos;ve been thinking .
they fired me .
janet basically told me
they were gonna take zola away .
i mean , possibly send her back to malawi .
you and me ?
i just needed some time .
i just needed to hold her and look at her
and just think about how everything ...
everything got so screwed up .
you should take zola .
janet has a problem with me , not with you .
and we need to do whatever we can
to make sure they don &apos;t take her away ,
and if that means that you have custody of her and i don &apos;t ,
well , then that &apos;s what we need to do .
you &apos;re not fired .
richard &apos;s gonna take the fall for you .
what ?
he can &apos;t do that . i &apos;m not gonna let him do that .
yes , you will .
if you want to keep this baby , you will let him protect you .
dan ?
oh , my god .
sweetheart .
danny , i was scared .
oh , i know .
i didn &apos;t know where you were .
i &apos;m right here .
you--you were asleep ,
and they--they didn &apos;t want me to wake you up .
i fell down .
you sure did .
you stayed , though .
i &apos;m not going anywhere .
don &apos;t go anywhere .
i &apos;m right here .
oh , i love you so much .
you &apos;re a big baby .
mm . okay .
all right , the top row
all got the device on the first round .
dr. webber tweaked the protocol
pretty substantially after that ,
which means the second set , that &apos;s these guys here ,
they all ... tend to do a lot better .
i &apos;ve been off the project for the last couple of weeks ,
but i &apos;m pretty sure i remember the drill .
i can walk you through it .
it had to be mice .
all right .
let &apos;s take it from the top .
how &apos;s it looking ?
can &apos;t tell .
they can &apos;t just take the baby away , can they ?
i don &apos;t know .
meredith says you didn &apos;t do it yet .
i didn &apos;t change my mind .
i know .
i know . you don &apos;t change your mind .
you &apos;d cut off my leg for me , wouldn &apos;t you ?
well , i wouldn &apos;t botch it like that guy did .
i &apos;d leave you a good stump so you could get a prosthesis .
when &apos;s the appointment ?
now .
okay .
okay .
let &apos;s go .
i ...
oh , god .
they &apos;re not gonna find a better family than two doctors .
it &apos;s--it &apos;s gonna be fine .
anybody want to go check on sofia ?
why ?
&apos;cause when somebody &apos;s talking about
taking someone &apos;s baby away ,
you want you to see your baby .
oh , you guys . she &apos;s fine .
i &apos;m right behind you .
ma @-@ maybe we should leave , too .
i mean , i &apos;m sure they don &apos;t want us
just sitting here staring at them .
i don &apos;t know .
they &apos;re trying to keep a family together .
that &apos;s ... not easy .
you know , it can &apos;t hurt to stick around ,
make sure they &apos;re okay .
you see , this--this is why you &apos;re the gunther .
i have terrible leadership instincts .
that doesn &apos;t make me a better leader .
a better person maybe , but--
we are in a bit of a bind right now .
a lot of questions came up today
about your relationship ,
about your employment--
well , she got her job back . that was a misunderstanding .
she disappeared .
well , that was a @-@ a miscommunication .
and the part about you two living in separate houses ,
that &apos;s miscommunication , too ?
look , i get it .
it &apos;s not easy bringing a child into a relationship .
you &apos;re allowed to have some bumps in the road .
but this afternoon , when it looked like
you two had split up , your wife got fired ,
she lied to me about it and left with the baby .
i set off some alarms .
now i &apos;m trying to dial them all back ,
but it &apos;s not that easy to do .
once the system is set in motion ,
there &apos;s a certain protocol that has to be followed .
once the agency believes
that there are questions about meredith--
janet , meredith is the best mother
a child could have .
she loves zola . she loves me .
and if there is a flaw with her , it &apos;s ...
she loves people so much that she &apos;ll do anything for them .
derek , please .
i hear you .
but no matter what i say ,
social services still has to reevaluate the placement .
and while that happens ,
zola can &apos;t be in your home .
i &apos;ll give you a minute to say good @-@ bye .
we should-- we should let her sleep .
she &apos;s ours . nobody &apos;s taking her away .
and ...
she &apos;ll wake up in half an hour ,
and then we &apos;ll ...
take her home for dinner .
nah . we should wake her up .
hi , little baby .
daddy &apos;s here .
daddy &apos;s here ...
hi , sweet girl .
little goose .
adele . honey .
yeah , i &apos;m on my way home .
no , i &apos;m not working late .
i told you , i &apos;m having dinner with you .
yeah , well ...
this time i mean it .
i &apos;m gonna give you an injection to numb the cervix .
if you &apos;d like some i.v. diazepam ,
it won &apos;t knock you out , but it &apos;ll calm you down .
okay .
i want to ask you one more time ...
are you absolutely sure this is what you want to do ?
then let &apos;s get started .
sorry .
it &apos;s ... time to go .
derek .
janet is a very nice lady .
we like her a lot .
she &apos;s gonna find you a very nice family
to go stay with for a while .
and then you &apos;re gonna come right back to us ,
and everything &apos;s gonna be fine .
okay ?
okay .
she likes her bottle room temperature , not too warm .
and she cannot sleep without that giraffe .
it &apos;s in the front pocket of the diaper bag .
and there &apos;s extra pacifiers in there .
you &apos;re gonna need them when you p @-@ put her in the car .
you think that true love is the only thing
that can crush your heart ...
the thing that will take your life ,
and light it up ...
or destroy it .
then ...
