I want -- I want a wife and a house and a family!
Amelia and, uh, Owen's wedding today -- I want that!
I can't marry him because I'm already married.
Okay, don't do that, okay?
Let's get you into you bed.
No, no. Stop.
Dr. Karev, hold on.
Hey. What are you -- Alex!
You made an astonishing error in judgment...
If you had been anyone else, you wouldn't have been suspended.
You would have been fired.
And I'm done talking about this here -- church and state.
My baby is dying, its blood supply is cut off,
and it's going to die.
You saved two lives today.
I like him.
Who?
Riggs.
I really like him.
Don't you wish
you could just take it back --
that thing you said, that thing you did.
They look very happy.
They do.
Yeah, that won't last.
I'm not saying I don't want it to.
I'm not just being an ass.
Actually...
It's just never been - my experience of happiness.
That it lasts.
There's no "Undo" button.
There's only hoping we can learn, we can change.
Right?
We can do better.
Has it been yours?
But do we have to do this right now?
You're right. Time and place, my bad.
They did literally just get married,
so let's try to be happy for them for like five minutes.
Absolutely.
Okay.
Yes! Let's be happy.
You want to dance?
Well, not that happy.
No? All right, well, then, um...
You want to get out of here?
And do what?
Be somewhere else.
Together.
We can't take back what we've done.
Are we doing this?
Doing what?
Dancing.
It has been a very stressful day.
And now it is over.
The newlyweds are wed. Mission accomplished.
And now is traditionally the time when we dance.
So, who's with me?
Not her.
I guess it's you, then.
We can't undo the past.
'Cause the future keeps coming at us.
What do we got?
We got a male, mid-20s.
Status post-blunt trauma to the face and neck.
Oh, my God. DeLuca.
Possible zygomatic fracture, a broken nose.
He might have a brain injury.
What happened?
We'll need a CT.
All right, let's get him to Trauma One.
Let's go.
Page Avery!
Two champagnes.
You got it.
I thought you were dancing with Maggie.
Eh, Webber cut in. Where were we?
You have to stop.
Stop what?
You have to stop being where I am, talking to me.
Sounds unreasonable with our jobs.
Besides, I like being where you are.
Stop.
We have a problem. I have a problem.
What's that?
Hold this. My phone is ringing.
Jo.
Hey, Wilson. What's up?
Wilson.
Slow down, slow down, slow down.
Take a breath.
What happened to DeLuca?
No, you're too good. I can't keep up with you.
You should have seen me in high school.
In high school, I only danced in my room.
Meredith's a good dancer.
Meredith's always trying to get people to dance.
Something has happened to DeLuca.
What?
He's in the E.R. He's been hurt.
That's all I know.
I should go. Should I go?
You should go.
She's been drinking. Can you drive her?
Sure.
Where are you going?
God.
What happened?
Broken nose. Bleeding posteriorly.
I paged Avery.
No. Karev, what happened to him?
He's got a hyphema --
the anterior chamber of his eye's filled with blood.
DeLuca. Look up for me.
Yeah, it's entrapped.
DeLuca, DeLuca! Calm down.
It's gonna be -- It's all right.
It's bleeding through his airway. He's aspirating.
We need to intubate him.
Push 20 of etomidate.
Chief? The police are here.
Where's Avery?
I put a call out to plastics.
I didn't ask for plastics. I asked for Avery.
I'm here, I'm here.
What the hell?
Looks like an orbital floor fracture with entrapment.
Who did this?
Head and face CT are pending.
Look, can you just reset his nose, please?
What happened, Jo?
I just --
He shouldn't have come back here.
He shouldn't have come back here.
Who shouldn't have come back here?
Here you go. Just take it easy.
Jo, where's Alex now?
Now's not the time.
Will you stay with her?
Me? She called you.
I need to reduce his fractured septum.
Bruising around the clavicle. There's an obvious deformity.
He broke it.
All right, let's get a chest film.
Start him on a Lorazepam drip.
All right, on my count.
1, 2, 3.
CT's ready.
Alex. May I speak to you for a moment?
We ready to go?
I got it.
Alex?
All right, let's go.
Alex!
I got this.
Now.
All right, let's move him.
Say something.
What do you want me to say?
You think no one is gonna realize this is you?
Look at that hand. You could go to jail.
This is assault.
I'm a doctor. I have a duty to report you to Bailey.
I came home. He was on top of her.
Jo was drunk.
He was... He --
Mer, come on.
You're gonna turn me in to Bailey?
You slipped in the rain. That's how you hurt your hand.
Mer.
Have you seen Andrew? I heard it's bad.
They said it's bad.
They're taking him to CT.
Oh, my God.
What happened?
I don't know.
DeLuca.
And he's a surgeon here?
He's a surgical resident, yes.
And you don't know the nature of the incident?
Well, his face is smashed in, so...
I mean as it pertains to...
That's all I know. It might have --
He might have been mugged.
It might have been a bar fight or something.
He was with one of our doctors when he came in, Dr. Karev.
That's --
K-A-R-E-V. I'll tell him to find you.
Excuse me. Tatum, go ahead.
Chief, you want me to page Dr. Hunt?
On his wedding night? Why would you do that?
Kepner's out. Hunt's out.
I was just wondering who's covering Trauma.
Um, looks like it's you.
Wait, you mean it? I'm coming back?
I just said, "It looks like it's you," Didn't I?
Uh, look. If you see Karev, have him find me?
Why? What do -- what do you think happened?
I don't know what happened. That's why I want to find Karev.
Miranda...
What?
Nothing. Nothing.
Okay.
DeLuca came into the E.R., apparently beaten pretty badly.
Can you tell me what happened?
I don't remember anything.
Was he here with you?
Jo.
Did DeLuca hurt you?
Do I need to call the police? Did he try and --
No. No. No. He -- It wasn't his fault.
It was my fault. I --
I ruined it. I ruined everything.
How?
He brought me home, and then I told him a--
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
What? What? You told him what --
I have to go to the hospital. I have to see Alex.
No, you're not gonna go anywhere now.
Now, is there someone I could call?
Y-your mom or your dad?
I don't ha--
You don't know anything.
I'm sorry.
Wilson, who can I call?
Just please go.
No. Not when you're like this.
No, yes, because I am drunk and gross and I am your surgeon.
I'm one of your surgeons. I'm a good surgeon.
This isn't me, so I just --
I'm okay now.
So I will see you again when I am a surgeon, okay?
So just please go --
No, no, no. You drank too much, okay?
You screwed up, and now
everything is crashing down around you.
Just go.
Well, you came to the right guy.
Because I've done it more than you ever will.
And I can tell you from experience...
With a little coffee and a little sunlight,
your troubles will get smaller.
And the world will keep standing.
I promise.
Okay?
Okay.
I have coffee.
Good.
We'll get you some food
and some aspirin
and you'll feel better.
And it will come back to you.
And whatever happened, you can tell me.
Or you can tell me who you'd like to talk to.
Sound all right?
Well, hell.
Go around the block!
What's wrong?
Nothing. It's just --
It's weird.
We broke up -- Badly.
I-I-I'm not sure if I'm the person he wants to see.
Forget it. I'm being crazy.
What?
No, I thought you were still with him.
With DeLuca? Me?
No. You thought that?
Yeah. I mean, you were very --
No! No. He broke -- We broke --
It ended.
Okay.
Yeah, a while ago.
Okay.
It was just too hard, you know, with us working together --
Yeah, well, I get that.
Not that it couldn't work at work with work people.
I think it can.
It could with the right work people.
Oh, God.
It's Maggie. I'm here.
Has he been conscious?
He was on intake, but we had to tube him.
What's it look like?
His head CT's clear, but he does have an eight-ball hyphema.
Who did this?
We don't know.
Karev brought him in,
but we haven't heard what happened yet.
Actually, we should find out who we need to call.
I'm gonna go grab his personnel file.
His mother. She's probably at work.
I'll call her. She knows me.
How is he? Is there a brain injury?
He just got out of CT.
Did you see his scan?
Well, no, but the radiologist said they're clear.
Will you look? Will you look at it yourself?
Alex, they said --
What if they missed something? What if --
What if he has a delayed bleed
and he drops dead tomorrow?
I will. I will look at the scans.
Alex, this is really bad.
It's bad. I know. I know.
I just --
I-I went crazy.
I just -- I --
What if I talk to DeLuca,
just, you know, before he says anything.
Maybe you should talk to the police.
No, no, no. Can we wait until we find out how bad it is?
You know, just --
Go -- go check his scans, please.
I will go check the scans.
Hey, um, have you talked to the police yet?
Uh, yeah. Uh, no. - I mean -- Uh why?
Miranda said you should come see her.
How's the hand?
What?
It looked like it was giving you trouble earlier.
Oh. I slipped in the rain.
Look, man, uh,
DeLuca's gonna clear everything up when he gets out of surgery,so
is there anything
there isn't.
Okay.
You know, I got the guy here. I helped him, okay?
This eye's a big problem. His pressure is getting out of control
We need to get him to an O.R.with an ophthalmologist right away
Could he lose his eyesight?
The thing is, the eye's paralyzed.
It's trapped in the fractured socket.
We get in there, we free it, then we drain the blood.
I've got a call into Jan Reger.
She's great, but she's in Whidbey Island, so --
You can't do it?
Uh, technically, yes, I -- I could --
Then why are we waiting for Jan Reger?
She's an ophthalmologist. I'd rather have
It's his eyesight.
It's his career, Jackson. Let's not wait.
She's right. Avery, if you can do it, do it.
I'll do it.
How's Kepner doing?
She's good.
She's, uh, sleeping.
What -- what are you doing?
Hey. Shhh. I'm here, I'm here.
Oh, she was just fussing a little bit,
so I- thought you could use the sleep,
and I just swooped her up.
We are bonding.
Somebody's just fascinated with their grandma.
Riveted. Yeah.
How are you feeling?
I'm okay. Hurt.
Oh, no doubt.
April, I can't believe what you went through.
It was worth it.
She's beautiful. She's just absolutely beautiful.
I just wish I knew what to call her.
Jackson didn't tell you?
No, I just got here.
He'd probably want to be here to tell you.
We don't have to wait for him.
Well, uh...
We wanted something strong, memorable...
Is it Catherine?
Are you little Catherine?
We thought there could only be one Catherine.
Her name is Harriet.
Harriet.
Oh. I like it.
Tubman.
Exactly. Tubman.
Also "The Spy."
which is a very good book.
I love it.
Harriet Avery.
It's beautiful. It just flows.
I'm sorry, who said her name was Avery?
Are those Andrew's head CTs?
I thought they were clean.
Yeah, I'm just double-checking.
I want to make sure we didn't miss anything.
They look good.
Thanks.
God.
What do you think happened?
I don't know. Maybe a mugging or something.
I just got off the phone with his parents.
And apparently, he neglected to tell them that we had broken up.
Oh, God.
Mer, was I really crappy to him?
DeLuca? He broke up with you.
He's a good, good guy.
Am I being stupid?
Chasing after Riggs, when DeLuca was right there?
I mean, am I being stupid?
I don't know. Maybe.
I was gonna talk to Riggs tonight.
At the wedding, while we were dancing, I was gonna say,
"Hey, how about you and me?"
And then Richard Webber jock-blocked me.
Of course.
And now Riggs thinks I'm in love with DeLuca.
I swear, maybe this is just --
What are you doing in scrubs?
I thought I'm going in on Avery.
Yeah. I'm going in. Not to operate.
Just...
I don't know.
To hold his hand.
I guess so.
Yeah.- Yeah
It's stupid.
It's not at all.
He's a good guy. Nothing wrong with that.
I know, but I'm not -- I don't --
Come on, he's gorgeous. You can't do much better.
Good luck. I hope it works out.
Okay.
Thanks.
You all right, then?
Thank you for bringing Maggie.
I said "Are you all right?"
I'm fine.
But you don't need to do that. You don't need to check on me.
What? I'm a nice guy. I'm being nice.
It's what I do.
You were very nice.
You did a nice thing for Maggie.
But now you're ruining it.
You okay?
Listen, Alex, it wasn't --
You were drunk.
It wasn't your fault, I know.
What are you talking about?
DeLuca.
He pushed himself on you, right?
You were drunk and he tried to take advantage of you --
No. No, no, no, no.
Alex. I -- I was drunk, yes,
because I was upset you had left.
You were upset about us? About me?
Yes, of course!
So this is what you do?
You bring this guy back to our place to screw?
If you would just let me talk to you --
'Cause you were upset.
Just listen to me!
You know what? Forget it.
It's like I said,
you can't help it, it's not your fault.
It's easy for you to throw people away,
to just move on when things are bad.
It's not you. It's the way you were raised --
or not raised.
I wanted to marry you.
I was asking you for something you're not capable of.
I should have known better.
Okay.
So, first, the muscle of his eye is trapped here
in the bone fracture, so I'm just gonna pop it out.
There we go. All right.
Micro scalpel, please?
Will he see again?
We'll see.
Once I am able to flush the blood out of there,
his intraocular pressure should come down
and his vision should return.
But don't worry.
His eyes should be just as pretty as ever.
Will everyone stop doing that?
I want his eyes to work because they're his eyes.
Sorry. You're right.
And he's a surgeon. He can't be one with one eye.
Okay?
It doesn't mean that I love him or I miss him or I'm pining.
He's a friend.
No, he's not a friend because the breakup was a train wreck,
and he probably hates me, but he is a person,
or was a person, that I was personal with.
I mean, you had feelings.
You had huge feelings,
and you can't be expected just to turn those feelings off like some robot.
Especially if you've been through something horrible together.
I get it.
Yeah, you do.
Try having a baby with him.
That's okay. I'm good.
Hello. How we doing?
Good. Almost done here.
How is he?
He's got a grade four hyphema.
Dr. Avery's trying to drain it now...
But...?
I'd be worried about rebleeds, long-term vision loss.
Which would mean...
Whoever did this just ended his career as a surgeon.
You know, I, um...
I think I know who it is.
Why haven't you said anything?
I'm not sure, um...
I --I think because I can guess what he did.
He reacted.
In a split second, in the moment,
and a horrible thing happened.
I know what that's like.
What about you? It is just blind loyalty?
It's not blind.
He's earned it.
When I first got here,
he was one of the worst people I had ever met in my life.
And now he's one of the best.
And I know both of those people are still in there.
I just want to make sure the right one wins.
Well, anyway, I --
I don't think it should come from me.
Me, either.
Okay. There you are.
What are you doing here?
Webber called me.
He said he thought you might be with me.
He said DeLuca got beat up, and then you ran off.
Look, I'm here 'cause I'm your friend, dummy.
What happened?
What are you doing?
I'm leaving.
Okay, fine. I'll drive you.
No, I'm leaving, leaving.
You're quitting?
Yeah.
You're quitting the program.
And you're not gonna tell me what this is?
I can't.
You -- Okay, hey. What the hell? Jo.
What happened with DeLuca?
You can talk to me.
I'm the one that left you at the bar with him. What?
She was really upset about Karev.
She was also really drunk.
So you left her with DeLuca?
To keep her safe, yes.
I didn't want to leave her there alone.
So he made sure she got home okay,
and you have to understand --
I do. She wanted to hurt Alex back.
But she may have hurt him for good this time.
I mean, this could end his career.
I mean, this goes well beyond just sleeping with another guy.
She didn't sleep with DeLuca.
Did he force himself on her?
No, he
He kept her safe!
He got her home. He made sure she was okay.
DeLuca was kind and nice and thoughtful, and --
DeLuca was trying to keep her from getting hurt
or from hurting herself, and then you walked in.
Okay, how do you know Edwards isn't lying about the whole thing?
Because I wanted her to be, which is awful.
But I was hoping for some reason
that you beat that man half to death
that doesn't make you a monster.
You know she wasn't lying.
Is DeLuca out of surgery? Did he wake up?
You have to go to Bailey and say something.
If he presses charges...
He should press charges.
He's not the bad guy here, and Jo isn't the bad guy.
We're the bad guys -- Really bad guys.
If I don't say something... If you don't say something...
I want to run.
You can't run.
I thought I grew up.
I just said this to Jo yesterday.
I went back there t-t-to talk to her, to make things right,
to do the grown-up thing.
Alex...
Let me talk to DeLuca. Just let me try, okay?
Wilson!
Did you hear what happened?
Not yet.
But I know it's not worth leaving here.
I made a mess.
I can't fix it. I can only make it worse.
So I am walking away from it.
It's better for everyone, okay?
Just --
Move. Please.
No.
I don't know what happened,
but whatever it is,
you won't get it fixed by running from it.
And you won't gain anything by quitting.
We don't quit.
I won't let you.
Now, you ditched me once today.
I'm not gonna let it happen again.
I mean, she's your baby.
You can call her whatever you want.
Just as long as it's "Avery."
I'll say this.
Avery wasn't my name, either.
But I took it on - and I built it into something.
And the name that I built will open doors for this little girl.
I'm just thinking of her future.
Yeah, well, the name Kepner means something, too.
What?
Where I come from, it means good people,
a tireless work ethic,
a fair and honest price for quality pork,
the people you call when you're in trouble.
Yeah, it may not open doors, but Kepner means something.
Now, can I have my -- Aah!
It's all right. It's all right. I've got her.
No, Catherine, I can hold my own baby.
No, April, you can't.
No, you can't.
You nearly died bringing her into this world.
You did something superhuman.
So now you get to rest and heal.
Harriet's just fine.
She's got her grandma,
and that's what grandmas are for.
So now just relax.
Sleep for an hour.
You're gonna have - her whole life to hold her.
Rest and heal.
She's gonna need you.
Couldn't you hyphenate?
Avery-Kepner?
We are hyphenating, Mom.
That's what we decided, right?
Yes. Kepner-Avery.
Well, why didn't you say that?
Because she's my baby.
That's your baby.
She is my baby.
Dr. Leo, call the pharmacy.
Dr. Leo, call the pharmacy.
Who's there?
Who is it? Is somebody there?
I'm sorry.
Jo.
Are you okay?
Am I okay?
You were pretty drunk, and I was out.
I was worried that he was gonna --
No. I'm -- I'm -- I'm fine. I'm perfectly fine.
How are you?
You tell me. How am I looking?
You look...
really ugly.
Don't make me laugh.
I'm sorry for putting you in that position.
Don't. It was just wrong place, wrong time.
No, you were trying to help me, and I j-- I just -- - Jo.
It wasn't you.
It was him.
Please don't tell anyone.
What I told you about...
That I --
That -- that you're married?
Yeah. Please.
Oh, I see.
That's why you came here, huh?
I thought you came here 'cause you cared.
No, that's -- That's not --
You know what? Don't worry.
It's cool. Your, uh -- Your secret's safe.
You know, you could pick better guys.
Jo?
What are you doing here?
Can I talk to you, please?
Get -- get away from me. No! - Please.
Listen, DeLuca, I didn't know.
No, go away!
Get out of here!
You came to my house -- - Leave!
I saw you on top of her.
Alex, go!
Somebody!
Go!
Somebody!
Help!
I'm sorry.
Help!
Call security, somebody?
Sir. Just calm down, all right?
We need you to calm down.
Let's calm him down.
You all right?
Oh, sorry, nope. Forget I asked.
Well, you can tell Maggie
that her boy's angio showed no vascular injuries...
so no worries.
Thanks.
He's not her boy. He's hurt.
She's just being kind.
All right.
I have to do something.
That I don't want to do.
Then don't do it.
I have to.
Then do it.
I will.
Nathan...
Come and sit with me a while.
What? Grey, what?
I don't have time to -- -
It was Alex.
What was Alex?
The person who beat up DeLuca...
was Alex.
When did you know?
I knew.
Something happened between and DeLuca.
Oh, stop. Just stop.
Dr. Bailey --
Hey. Call security.
Tell them to find the police.
Tell them Dr. Karev does not leave this hospital.
What?
Meredith.
It's Alex?
Yeah, come on.
You knew it?
And you didn't say anything?
Karev.
You're under arrest for aggravated assault.
He just walked up and turned himself in.
Made it real easy. He'll be city lock-up.
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can be used against you in a court of law.
You have the right to an attorney
and to have an attorney present during questioning.
If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be appointed for you.
Do you understand these rights as I have read them to you?
Yes.
You were just gonna lie to everyone?
Did you know about Karev?
No! I didn't.
Not for sure.
Ow!
Warren.
I have been lied to by so many people today.
If you lied to me, too...
I guessed, okay? I had suspicions.
What? And you didn't tell me?
Because I didn't know.
Okay, look, you can tell your wife when you have suspicions,
but you can't tell the Chief.
And you weren't my wife. You were the Chief.
Church and state.
I wasn't going to lie to everyone.
You lied to me.
I asked you what happened, and you lied.
Alex and I were trying to -- - trying to what?
Trying to figure out a way to justify the beating
he gave to Andrew? What?
I don't know.
I poured my heart out to you all day.
And you knew this.
It wasn't about you, Maggie.
I am your sister.
I know.
Do you?
'Cause it means something different to me.
You encouraged me to stay.
You offered me a home and a family.
And I accepted. And I wasn't kidding.
I will go down swinging for you.
It means something to me.
I thought I could trust you.
You can.
From here on out.
Don't do it again.
Don't lie to me again.
Okay.
Okay.
I'm -- I'm gonna get that.
Oh, God. What are you doing here?
I want to know what the problem is.
What?
At the wedding, you said we had a problem.
I want to know what the problem is.
The problem is you showing up here, looking for --
What are you looking for?
I'm not looking for anything. It's right here.
Meredith. Hey! Listen.
There's something happening here.
We both know it.
So what's the problem?
Someone is going to get hurt.
I can handle it.
Not you.
From what I can see, you seem indestructible.
So what's the problem?
Tell me.
The problem is...
you're wrong.
I don't feel the same way.
So let's just drop it, okay?
Good night.
Best to keep the past in the past.
Move on. Learn from it.
Who was that?
Oh. That was no one.
It was just someone looking for directions.
Where are you going?
If we don't learn from our mistakes...
...we wind up locked into a future we'd never choose.
It was nice knowing you.
Shut up.
What?
You think I'm keeping my job or my medical license?
We don't know what's going to happen.
I'll tell you what isn't gonna happen.
Me ever setting foot in that hospital again.
Sorry.
Why?
You didn't punch the guy.
But I told Bailey.
You did?
Yes. I had to.
I know.
It's better. You did the right thing.
Mm. Right now, being the guy who got beat up would feel better.
You said it yourself. We're grown-ups.
We can't run.
We have to face up to the stupid things we do.
Supposedly, if you face up to them,
something good comes out of it.
I don't know what, but...
15 to 20, probably.
I'm sorry.
Shut up.
The past is written.
There's no changing it.
What's done is done.
But the future is ours to choose.
For better or worse.
