my father was an innocent man ,
destroyed by powerful people .
the graysons are behind this ,
and they &apos;re gonna pay .
i &apos;ve dedicated my life to avenging his death .
eventually , someone &apos;s gonna find you out .
and i won &apos;t stop
until they &apos;ve all paid the price .
wrapped my car around the utility pole ,
and i broke sara &apos;s spine .
i haven &apos;t spoken to her since that night .
your husband had me investigate
the cause of the wreck .
it was one of your children .
so it was patrick .
victoria will cover it up .
it was me , i swear ! i &apos;ll confess .
you &apos;re my girl , and that &apos;s all that matters .
you came back here to help . you &apos;re everything to me .
i can &apos;t marry you , emily .
the only way to win daniel back is share a piece of yourself .
i want nothing more than to stand beside you
on our wedding day .
and i want that , too .
love built on lies is an arduous endeavor .
for wherever passion and treachery meet ,
dissolution begins .
hey , come back to bed .
uh , after my swim .
watch out for sharks , okay ?
still , we fight to hold our ground in the emptiness ...
always .
ignoring the fact that every relationship ...
even the ones we cherish ...
inevitably dies .
nolan ?
nolan !
nolan ?
nolan ?
you &apos;re okay .
what the hell are you doing barging in here ?
didn &apos;t you hear me screaming for you ?
i was doing my morning hydrotherapy .
i just saw patrick leaving . i thought you were in trouble .
no , that ... couldn &apos;t be further from the truth .
last night was our first night together .
that &apos;s good that it just started ,
&apos;cause it has to end .
because he tried to rid the world of conrad grayson ?
visions of that guy &apos;s demise dance in your head 24 / 7 .
an innocent man died instead .
patrick is a criminal .
yeah , not the patrick i know .
you don &apos;t know him well enough to say that .
wait , wait . i &apos;m sorry .
are you telling me how to feel ?
i am telling you to be rational .
what do you even see in this guy ?
someone who wants to fit in here but doesn &apos;t .
em , someone like me .
we kept &quot; us &quot; a secret for a reason .
patrick and i didn &apos;t wanna get caught up
in the crossfire between you and victoria .
so what happens now ?
is he your next takedown ?
i haven &apos;t decided .
i wish things were different , nolan .
you have the handwriting of a mail bomber .
we can go back to paper menus .
those worked just fine for 35 years .
don &apos;t you want a hip and happening spot
where a certain parisian magazine editor
will feel at home ?
i think margaux already does .
you did a really great job with the remodel .
yeah , there &apos;s just one thing missing--
a bald little man who &apos;s prone to spit @-@ up and diaper rash .
yeah .
well ... i miss carl , too ,
and so does my grandma in jersey .
when &apos;s he coming back ?
after daniel and emily &apos;s wedding .
it &apos;s the last distraction before the season dies down ,
and ... my life starts again .
if i had my wish ,
that distraction would be over with now .
anyway , i &apos;m out .
my mother has summoned the entire family to breakfast
to discuss the impending nuptials .
i am so looking forward to seeing my father .
you &apos;re not serious .
actually , while i detest him more than ever ,
he and i have had a reconciliation of sorts .
it &apos;s for a good reason .
there &apos;s no good reason .
how did he manipulate you ?
he didn &apos;t .
i manipulated him , and i did it to protect you .
hey .
you know that charlotte lied to conrad
and confessed to sabotaging his brakes ?
that is a new low for victoria .
jack , patrick did it .
if that &apos;s the case ,
then what &apos;s to stop him from getting rid of her
to keep the truth from ever coming out ?
i &apos;ll be watching him .
i would never let anything happen to charlotte .
you know that .
i want him gone !
jack , just stay out of it .
the last time you didn &apos;t loop me in ,
i had to send my son away
&apos;cause i thought he might be in danger .
hustle up ! we &apos;re late !
you &apos;re forcing people to stumble around in the dark , emily .
that &apos;s how people get hurt .
you &apos;re good with a knife .
yeah , well , i &apos;ve slaved away in enough restaurants .
well , then you &apos;re invited to one
that &apos;ll treat you like a king .
the spruced up stowaway premieres tomorrow ,
and drinks are on me .
well , thank you , charlotte . i appreciate that .
i have to see how i feel , though .
i &apos;m coming off a pretty late night .
so late , you didn &apos;t come home .
may i have a word ?
yeah , sure .
excuse me .
yeah ?
we have pressing matters to discuss .
go to the gallery , and i &apos;ll arrive shortly .
all right ?
okay .
we have the windows in the foreground here .
um , so ...
uh ... you can see the tone ...
thank you-- of the architecture ,
and the thing i wanna show you most of all ...
perverse as that display may be ,
we &apos;re here to discuss the sacred bond of marriage .
call it motherly concern , but i couldn &apos;t help but notice
the tension between the future bride and groom .
so before things progress to the point of no return ,
let me assure you , there is no shame in hitting pause
while you sort things out .
well , that won &apos;t be necessary , victoria .
as a matter of fact ,
daniel and i have decided on our honeymoon--
a weekend cruise to nantucket for immediate family .
yeah , it &apos;s full steam ahead .
we talked last night , and ...
we couldn &apos;t be more on the same page .
a family honeymoon .
i thought it would be nice way to decompress
after the insanity of the wedding .
won &apos;t it just ? hmm .
the yacht leaves from here right after the reception .
honey , you have a little something .
what ? what ?
let me get it .
daniel , could you carve out some time for me today ?
mm . it &apos;s gonna be tough .
i &apos;m covering for margaux &apos; cause she &apos;s in l.a.
please ? i need your business savvy .
i wanna do my part to boost the bottom line of the stowaway .
i didn &apos;t know you had such an entrepreneurial spirit .
i &apos;ll move some meetings .
good morning , kitten .
it &apos;s lovely to have you back in the litter .
lovely to be here , daddy .
won &apos;t your mistress be joining us , conrad ?
i &apos;m sure we could rustle up a pop @-@ tart .
she is not my mistress .
morgan is a real estate specialist .
and what will you be purchasing ? a place in hell ?
why , i &apos;m sorry to disappoint ,
but i &apos;m actually on the other side of that transaction .
grayson manor has been sold .
most of our other assets have been liquidated
to keep us afloat , but this estate
is still driving us into the red .
morgan produced an all @-@ cash buyer--
a saudi prince , no less , with an offer that i--
i just couldn &apos;t refuse .
stop gloating , you spiteful beast .
you know this home is my haven .
oh , well , here i thought
your haven was your illegitimate son
and that adorable little gallery you share .
at the risk of sounding like a neurotic bride ,
wasn &apos;t this house supposed to be command central for the wedding ?
oh , it &apos;s okay , babe . we &apos;ll figure something else out .
or maybe we could buy it .
it would be an honor to keep grayson manor in the family .
magnanimous offer , but i &apos;m afraid the deal &apos;s done .
how long do we have ?
escrow closes in three weeks .
well , the wedding &apos;s in five .
my plan depends on them staying here ,
and i need you here , too .
having a man on the inside has been invaluable .
what ?
well , we share one kiss last night ,
and now you &apos;re doling out compliments .
not here , aiden .
fine , but we &apos;re continuing this later .
so who do we take out of the equation first ?
the real estate agent ?
she already closed the deal .
is the buyer vulnerable ?
he &apos;s a saudi royal
paying cash , so no .
our only option ...
is to take down the house itself .
and , uh , nolan , that is call number three .
if it gets to four , i &apos;m calling the cops .
what is it ?
conrad sold my hamptons estate .
did it just to hurt you , i bet .
for the last time .
from now on , i vow to be free of him .
and how can i help ?
allow me to put the gallery and its contents
in your name .
that way , he can never profit from our hard work .
you trust me with this ?
my entire future
is now in your reliable hands .
and i &apos;ll do everything i can to protect it .
i know you will , patrick .
just as i know what you &apos;ve done .
you tried to take conrad &apos;s life .
you don &apos;t need to deny it .
that bastard humiliates you every chance he gets .
he treats you with nothing but hate .
i couldn &apos;t stand by and let him get away with it .
i &apos;m not gonna apologize for wanting him dead .
but you gotta believe me . i ...
i never meant for an innocent man to die .
conrad put father paul in that car , not you .
you tried to spare me from a monster .
it was an act of pure selflessness ,
and one i will always cherish .
so what now ? does conrad know ?
no . he never will .
i made sure of that . you &apos;re safe .
i love you , mom .
you never called me that before .
well , i didn &apos;t know i &apos;d be giving out business advice
while you tried on shoes all morning .
i &apos;m a multitasker .
yeah ? and what &apos;s your task here ?
i &apos;m surprising jack with a cake
to celebrate the bar &apos;s makeover .
actually , could you pop in and grab it
while i run across the street and get a card ?
the order &apos;s under &quot; stowaway . &quot;
all right , well , hurry up , okay ?
hi . picking up something for the stowaway ?
sara .
i didn &apos;t expect to see you--
walking ?
yeah , the , uh , random time
you dropped into into the rehab facility ,
i hadn &apos;t quite mastered it yet .
well , you &apos;ve made , uh , you &apos;ve made so much progress .
no help from you .
listen , i wanted to be there , okay ?
you weren &apos;t interested .
i &apos;m not talking about moral support .
i &apos;m talking about being able to pay
for the medical treatment i still need .
everything &apos;s covered by the settlement .
not quite . your mommy and daddy
screwed me in the fine print ,
so now i gotta work 60 hours a week
to afford a crappy h.m.o.
i didn &apos;t know that .
yeah , well , you &apos;ve been busy .
i saw your , uh , your publisher &apos;s profile
in your magazine .
i love how i am the problem you had to overcome
on your road to greatness .
sara ?
come on , charlotte . let &apos;s go .
you know , maybe you fooled your readers into thinking
you &apos;ve grown up , danny ,
but you will always be the clueless frat boy who was
&quot; all good to drive &quot; after five drinks ,
and you crashed your car ,
you crushed my spine , and you never looked back !
come on , let &apos;s go .
you didn &apos;t return any of my calls .
got a little worried .
sweet to check on me .
you didn &apos;t need to .
well , the truth is , i &apos;m--i &apos;m selfish .
i just didn &apos;t wanna be alone .
truth is ... neither do i.
what &apos;s going on ?
let &apos;s just say i did something impulsive and ...
so stupid .
patrick ...
we started something great .
something that &apos;s moving faster
than anything i &apos;ve ever experienced with ... a @-@ anyone else .
but life has gotten suddenly complicated .
look , if we had met in another place ,
in another summer , or--or had different friends ,
different mothers ...
nolan , we talked about this , right ?
we agreed we weren &apos;t gonna let
victoria and emily come between us .
turns out it &apos;s not that easy .
that &apos;s not an answer ... nolan .
it &apos;s not good enough for me , at least .
i wanna be with you .
i don &apos;t know why they get a vote .
they shouldn &apos;t .
then what &apos;s standing in our way ?
well , at least it &apos;s still in one piece .
are you ?
i guess .
one thing &apos;s certain . she hates me .
daniel , that was a shock to both of you .
emotions were running high . sara was angry .
ah , she was right .
i am clueless .
i created a new life for myself with emily
and ... put her out of my mind completely .
that &apos;s not true .
if you didn &apos;t care about her ,
you wouldn &apos;t have tried to reach out to her two years ago .
oh , i should &apos;ve tried harder .
charlotte , she &apos;s working in a bakery to pay
for medical bills that are my responsibility .
dad keeps our legal papers in the city .
i &apos;m gonna dig up that settlement
and do what i should &apos;ve done a long time ago--
read it .
mill &apos;s family bakery .
hello ? may i speak to the manager , please ?
speaking .
oh , great . i need to report an employee
who was inexcusably rude at your bakery today .
her name ?
sara munello .
prince mishari signed off on the inspection report .
that &apos;s great .
his final request is for additional pictures
of your private beach .
well , given the king &apos;s ransom he &apos;s paying ,
you and your photographer will have unfettered access
to immortalize every magnificent acre .
you know , this deal went down so quickly .
there are rooms here i still haven &apos;t seen .
the walk @-@ in humidor .
the billiards hall .
your bedroom suite .
i love a good master .
and i love the attention of a beautiful woman .
however ... i &apos;m not in the market for one .
i thought i heard the chatter of rats ,
and here you both are .
morgan , might i suggest a renovation project to the prince ?
should tear down the conservatory .
it &apos;s a useless room .
mr. mathis ...
i suspect that my husband
and his real estate broker are colluding .
to what end ?
to hide the profits of the sale of my house .
well , i &apos;ll have my contacts in banking
look into the transaction
and report any suspicious activity .
thank you .
in the meantime , i suppose
i should make new living arrangements .
oh , don &apos;t be silly .
as long as you keep what patrick did a secret ,
you &apos;ll always have a place with me .
well , then consider it done .
now if i were you ,
i would spend less time
reading about tourist destinations
and more time exploring ways
we can send emily thorne packing .
hey , sorry , i got swamped here in the city .
uh , i &apos;m coming home soon .
don &apos;t bother .
a random crack opened up in the living room ,
so i called the contractor ,
and guess what we have ? foundation issues .
what , you get a second opinion ?
just got a third . they start work early tomorrow ,
so you should probably just stay at the penthouse .
you sure you don &apos;t need my help ?
no , i got it covered .
i &apos;ll call you when it &apos;s safe to come home , okay ?
daniel ?
everything okay ?
yeah .
just preoccupied with some ... work .
i &apos;m sorry i can &apos;t be there to help .
trust me , i &apos;m fine .
good night .
do it .
to my ultimate revenge .
may it unfold as we &apos;ve planned .
it will .
i always thought i &apos;d handle this alone ,
and i didn &apos;t need anybody &apos;s help .
that &apos;s because that &apos;s how we were trained .
i can &apos;t imagine doing this without you , aiden .
not anymore .
look , our future &apos;s so close .
we play this right ,
it &apos;s just me ... you ...
and a beach in the maldives .
sounds like a dream .
oh , it &apos;s real .
damn ... stowaway .
oh , you clean up nice .
the only thing i hate about this sexy little minx
is that , uh , she &apos;s closed today .
this seat &apos;s , uh , always open for friends .
something the matter ?
yeah ...
emily .
she &apos;s kinda screwing with my life ,
and i want it to stop .
call her on it . don &apos;t back down .
well , you do speak from experience , or ...
at least , i imagine you do ,
or i don &apos;t know , or not . forget it . ignore me .
just--just talk , nolan .
she &apos;s not completely off @-@ base .
still , i had to make a choice .
so i made the one that &apos;s right for me .
i &apos;m ...
i &apos;m seeing patrick osbourne .
victoria grayson &apos;s patrick ?
see , emily thinks he &apos;s shady .
but i think he &apos;s the one .
yeah , no , i mean , i know it &apos;s fast .
it is , nolan . it is .
look , i &apos;ve heard things about him . he &apos;s messed up .
he tried to kill conrad . instead he killed that priest .
did she tell you that ?
&quot; she &quot; who ?
emily .
yeah , the only way that you would have known about patrick
is if she discussed it with you .
you know ...
i &apos;m done talking around what &apos;s real
when we shouldn &apos;t have to .
i can &apos;t sit in a chair reserved for friends
and lie to your face anymore .
emily thorne ...
is amanda clarke .
you know it .
i know it .
and now we both know the truth about each other .
make it look like they own half the hamptons .
how &apos;s that ?
yeah .
be right back .
okay .
i @-@ i &apos;m morgan holt--
the agent for the property next door .
of course , miss holt .
i &apos;m emily , daniel grayson &apos;s fiancee .
congratulations on what &apos;s sure to be
the biggest sale of the year .
try decade .
emily , you &apos;ve got such a ruckus going on over here .
i trust this project will be ending soon ?
well , hopefully tomorrow ,
but then i &apos;ll have to do it all over again
in a couple of years .
that &apos;s how long my contractor says
i can stave off mother nature .
what on earth do you mean ?
my foundation &apos;s shifting again .
again ?
can &apos;t you shore it up ?
the problem is the ground under the foundation .
environmental engineers call it
&quot; dramatic beach erosion . &quot;
it &apos;s a big problem on this side of the island .
well , there must be something you can do .
sadly , no .
and if global warming continues
to spawn more superstorms ,
the beach is gonna disappear in half that time .
still , how can you resist a view like that ?
for now , i &apos;m just gonna fight the useless fight
until i run out of money ...
or sand .
excuse me .
nolan ?
you left this at the stowaway .
yeah , i realized that after you ...
threw me out of the bar .
so wait , are we ... speaking again ?
there &apos;s something that &apos;s been eating away at me .
how long have you known ?
i &apos;ve never not known .
before he died , her father made me promise
that i would look out for her .
it &apos;s a simple request from a man that i idolized .
i just ... never realized it would blow up into this .
i should have just come out and asked you .
it &apos;s not like i didn &apos;t suspect that you knew ,
but the chance that you didn &apos;t
always stopped me .
i hate that my first instinct
is to protect her after everything she &apos;s done !
you &apos;re not alone .
why do we do it ?
because we see the broken
and betrayed little girl inside .
i understand if our relationship
is finished .
if it is ...
at least it ended in truth .
i &apos;m your friend , nolan .
unfortunately , friends can &apos;t always tell each other
what they want to hear .
i get what you &apos;re going through .
i married someone with secrets , but the difference is
i never really knew who amanda was .
you know full well about patrick .
patrick &apos;s not evil .
that &apos;s not what i &apos;m saying .
i &apos;m saying that right now patrick doesn &apos;t know
that charlotte took the rap for him .
yes , taking her out would be one way of ensuring
that the blame stays with her , but , uh ...
if you can tell me with 100 % certainty
that he won &apos;t be driven to hurt anyone else ...
i &apos;ll drop this .
then i have to let him go .
but ... how ?
i &apos;ll take care of it .
did you want to say good @-@ bye to him ?
i don &apos;t think i can .
will you promise me ...
that he won &apos;t be hurt ?
what are you doing here ?
i stopped by your work
to apologize for what happened yesterday .
your boss gave me your address .
ex @-@ boss .
i was fired .
i &apos;m so sorry .
it &apos;s not on you to apologize .
for the record , it was daniel &apos;s fiancee emily
who gave the details of the car accident
to the magazine .
he &apos;s not the same spoiled frat boy , sara .
he &apos;s changed .
yeah , well , it seems he still has other people
cleaning up his messes , so ...
he &apos;d kill me if he knew i was here .
i know you &apos;re probably gonna be angry at him forever ...
angry ?
i hate him ...
but not as much as i hate myself .
you know , after all the hell that danny &apos;s put me through ...
my heart still skipped a beat when i saw him yesterday .
is that pathetic or what ?
not at all .
whatever .
look , i &apos;ve got stuff to do .
a new job &apos;s not just gonna coming knocking . so ...
or maybe it just did .
i am not accustomed to rushing home
for cryptic texts , mr. mathis ,
especially when i &apos;m in the middle of a sale
with brancusi bronze .
what could possibly be so urgent ?
a time @-@ sensitive transaction about to take place
in conrad &apos;s office , which i thought you might enjoy .
thank you .
you &apos;ll have to pour another one for your property prostitute .
i assume that &apos;s who you &apos;ll be fitting ?
indeed , morgan is on her way with the closing documents .
and i expect to see every line item of that deal ...
to the cent .
ahh , the steady thrum of your persecution complex .
fear not , victoria .
there &apos;ll be enough profit to go around .
not anymore .
when were you planning to disclose
the 30 feet of beachfront you lost in the last 20 years ?
that &apos;s absurd .
our beach is as big as it &apos;s always been .
is it ? here &apos;s the coastal commission &apos;s most recent survey .
what do you know , conrad ? we &apos;re slipping into the sea .
the shoreline erosion is indisputable .
keeping it from the buyer is fraud
and makes me liable .
oh , well , not if you &apos;re fired .
you think you can just hire someone else ?
no one is coming near your toxic property
when i tell every broker in new york
how you tried to screw me .
you did this .
you &apos;re so desperate to keep this in your feeble grasp ,
that you just ruined an extraordinary chance
for me to keep this family solvent and intact .
oh , conrad , my hands are clean .
and this pile hasn &apos;t been a home for years .
which is why i &apos;m doing what i never thought i could ..
letting go of grayson manor .
i &apos;ve been putting my affairs in order ,
and i am leaving it and you permanently .
well ... if it &apos;s a divorce you want ,
you better brace yourself for a fight .
well , that &apos;s the beauty of what &apos;s before us .
with a worthless estate , there &apos;s nothing to fight for .
i &apos;ll be out by week &apos;s end .
she has to stay .
well , unfortunately , there &apos;s no way to keep victoria
inside the house or the marriage .
everything she cares about
now lies outside the grayson empire .
the graysons have taken everything from me .
i &apos;m not gonna let them take away my future with you .
so what do you suggest ?
trap her with the one thing she can &apos;t resist .
well , the fact is
you &apos;re my real estate attorney , edward .
you &apos;re supposed to know about the erosion issue .
well , instead ...
look , you &apos;ve cost me millions ! all right ?
i &apos;ll see you in court .
i never understood why rich people don &apos;t lock their doors .
you know , if we can &apos;t sell this place ,
perhaps we &apos;ll just turn it into a home for wayward boys .
i mean , there &apos;s victoria &apos;s bastard ,
her brit ...
you .
i &apos;m not staying after our chat .
well , what could we possibly have to discuss ?
the only concern that we share--
charlotte &apos;s safety .
continue .
my information isn &apos;t free .
you are much too late for a handout .
i don &apos;t want money .
first--i want your word
that you will handle this without bloodshed .
and second ...
you and i will never be good ,
but once i tell you this ...
the two of us ...
declare a cease @-@ fire .
agreed ?
well , don &apos;t just stand there . shoot .
now i remember when i let you sneak into my parties .
now i &apos;m lining up to get into yours .
yeah , well , open up a &quot; vouletab ... &quot;
and i can guarantee you a both
anytime you want .
just make sure those fashionistas order food ,
even if they don &apos;t eat it .
i see you took my advice about boosting profit margins .
i &apos;m proud of you .
you might not be after you see what i &apos;ve done .
she lost her job .
helping her get another was the least i could do .
our family lawyers took her to the cleaners .
the settlement language specified
only sara &apos;s hospital expenses were to be covered .
that was a disgusting way to get out of paying
for the years of rehab and physical therapy she needed .
so are you gonna talk to her ?
i was planning to . i ...
i don &apos;t know what to say .
just be honest . the words will come .
smells good .
yeah , a mafia don i did time with
gave me his nonna &apos;s lasagna recipe .
jack &apos;s coming over for , um ...
boys &apos; night .
how &apos;d it go with patrick ?
it &apos;s over .
yeah , jack went to , uh , conrad ,
and told him that patrick tampered with his brakes .
he &apos;s probably being chased out of town as we speak .
jack went rogue , and you didn &apos;t tell me about it ?
actually , i gave him my blessing .
this had nothing to do with you , emily .
victoria took a huge risk covering that up .
patrick is precious to her ,
which makes him invaluable to me .
you had no right eliminating someone
who was an asset to my plan !
well , buckle up for what &apos;s next .
i told jack that i &apos;m in the inner circle .
what ? !
he was never supposed to know that .
do you realize how out of touch you sound ?
besides , aiden , jack , and i
are the only moons circling planet emily .
i know you &apos;ve tried to keep us in separate orbits ,
but we were bound to collide . and you know what ?
i &apos;m glad we did ,
because there are no more lies between us
about you or anything else .
that &apos;s a huge mistake .
not for me , it wasn &apos;t .
your need to control everything and everyone
has kept me isolated when i didn &apos;t need to be .
i &apos;ve had no one else to talk to about the crap that i &apos;m going through .
i talked to you about patrick !
all you did was tell me to be rational .
i can &apos;t turn off my emotions . i &apos;m not a robot .
i &apos;m a human being .
i thought we were on the same page .
you wanted to be a part of this .
yeah .
but , ems , all i have ever really wanted ...
was friendship .
what are we doing in this bayshore dump ?
my contacts provided me with conrad &apos;s financials .
i did some digging ,
connected the dots , and you &apos;re right .
he does have a problem with sharing .
what &apos;s in here ?
don &apos;t be scared , victoria .
heaven awaits .
now isn &apos;t that a sight for sore eyes ?
is it truly ours ?
yes .
it &apos;s the missing grayson fortune .
you scam artist !
you have been hiding everything from me !
what are you talking about ?
this family &apos;s entire estate is locked in a warehouse .
in gold .
i saw it with my own eyes .
well , if that &apos;s the truth ,
i &apos;d like the coordinates of that location .
do not feign ignorance . to think i almost
walked away from this marriage with nothing .
well , i am not going to leave quite so easily now .
you know , curious as i am as to the cause of this windfall ,
you know , i &apos;ve been waiting your return to discuss
one of my own , although mine &apos;s a little less financial
and a little more forensic in nature .
this knife that i was told belonged to declan porter ,
the one that charlotte said she used
to sabotage my car in order to kill me .
well , it turns out it comes from the patrick osbourne collection .
were you aware of that ? and do not feign ignorance .
where did you learn of this ?
oh , from the same detective who covered up the details of the car wreck in the first place .
remarkable-- convincing your daughter
to confess to murder just to save your mongrel son .
please , conrad ...
would you have me beg for his life ?
oh , victoria , i &apos;m not gonna kill him .
no , no . i &apos;m just gonna pluck him away from you forever .
my associates are already handling it .
you know , i still root for the mets because of you .
my father will never forgive me for it .
yeah , well , yankee fans are spoiled
and used to getting their way .
you know , some of my favorite memories are watching those games at your house .
beers on the couch ,
barbecues that didn &apos;t call for coats and ties .
i took a look at the settlement last night .
i never had before .
i always thought you &apos;d be better taken care of than you were .
though my mom and dad , they led ...
oh , would you grow a pair
and stop hiding behind your parents ?
i &apos;m not hiding behind my parents .
and if you think that i &apos;m
looking for a handout--
will you let me finish ?
i thought you were set for life , sara .
and now i know what really happened .
you were cheated , it wasn &apos;t right ,
and i am sorry .
i &apos;m sorry , okay ?
why are you doing this , daniel ?
to earn your forgiveness .
i know i have a long , long way to go ,
but i want to try , okay ?
you gonna let me try ?
victoria and conrad are reunited with their money .
considering the trust between them is at an all @-@ time low , they &apos;re going to want
to account for every last bit .
which will keep them busy and bound together
until my wedding day .
we should have given it to them in pennies .
what &apos;s wrong ?
i had a fight with nolan .
his priorities are different now .
everything &apos;s off @-@ balance .
that &apos;s because you &apos;re caught between two worlds , emily .
and this life we &apos;ve chosen it &apos;s a ...
it &apos;s a selfish one .
you know , we &apos;re lucky that we found each other .
just remember , in five weeks &apos; time ,
this will all be over , we &apos;ll be together .
the hamptons will just be a distant memory ,
and we &apos;ll never see any of these people ever again .
conrad had men waiting for me
in front of the gallery and by my car .
i slipped out the back .
thank god . yeah , i @-@ i don &apos;t understand this .
i thought you said he wouldn &apos;t find out .
there isn &apos;t time for an explanation .
all right ? you must go now .
go ? go where ?
to the philadelphia airport .
what ?
this is your bag . inside are your tickets , some cash ,
and contact information for someone who owes me a favor .
no .
please , patrick .
conrad is a ruthless man . you are not safe .
he &apos;s a ruthless man . i &apos;m not leaving you here
alone with him .
i will take care of him .
it &apos;s too soon . i @-@ i have questions .
i &apos;m just getting to know you .
i will bring you back when the time is right ,
i swear , and i will give you the answers .
all of them .
please .
take it .
why ?
go .
i can &apos;t .
go !
obey your mother .
i should have taken you up on that good @-@ bye .
yeah , that &apos;s why i offered it .
no closure sucks .
emily .
what &apos;s wrong ?
look , i &apos;m ...
i know i &apos;m not very good at expressing myself .
the thing is , y--
you &apos;re two of the most important people in my life .
the wedding is in five weeks , and--and this--
this last bit of time we have--
i don &apos;t want either of you to feel alone or in the dark
or at risk ...
because of me .
i want nothing left unsaid .
uh , why ? you &apos;re leaving long island ,
not the planet .
in order for me to do this properly ,
i ... have to disappear without a trace .
i &apos;ll be gone for good . you &apos;ll never see me again .
is that all you have to say ?
no .
like i said , i want to tell you everything ...
including my plan for august 8th ...
the day victoria grayson ...
goes down for the murder of emily thorne .
