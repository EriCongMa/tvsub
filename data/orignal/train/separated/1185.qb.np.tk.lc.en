第三季 第二十二集
either you shut hanna up , or i will !
i drove by the accident on my way home .
his car was gone .
told you it would sink .
malcolm , this is aria .
nice to meet you .
it is so nice to meet you too , malcolm .
am i just crazy to think that this could work ?
toby is &quot; a. &quot;
who &apos;s &quot; e. lamb &quot; ?
that &apos;s what toby called himself to get in and out of radley .
so , what does this mean ? is toby dead ?
maybe he just wants us to think that he &apos;s dead .
either way , spencer needs to know about this .
where is spencer ?
i was hoping she &apos;d be here , but she isn &apos;t .
do you think spencer just didn &apos;t get your s.o.s. ?
maybe , but she must have gotten one of the other
twelve messages we sent .
okay , you guys , she has ditched school before .
all right ? it &apos;s not a big deal .
yeah , you &apos;re right , i guess .
okay , we just need to get through today .
if she doesn &apos;t call or show up ,
we &apos;ll go to her house after school .
girls , good , you &apos;re all together .
i think you know spencer &apos;s sister , melissa .
have you seen spencer ? have you talked to her ?
not today .
is something wrong ?
spencer didn &apos;t come home last night .
she &apos;s not answering her phone .
i was hoping she was here with you .
which is why i came here before i went to the police .
police ?
i understand spencer &apos;s been a little &quot; distracted &quot; lately .
was there something on her mind that she shared with you ?
anything about her plans ?
no , mr. hackett ,
she hasn &apos;t said anything to us .
you &apos;re her friends . she must have said something .
you can now call the police from my office .
thank you .
let me know if you hear from spencer .
yes , sir .
hello .
hello .
i &apos;m eddie .
i &apos;m jane doe .
least that &apos;s what it says on my chart .
i &apos;ve met some of your relatives .
i come from a long line of does .
just gonna check the dressing on those bandages .
check away .
what &apos;s a three @-@ o @-@ two ?
i heard someone say that &apos;s what i am .
it &apos;s a law that lets paramedics
send you for a psych evaluation
instead of throwing you in jail .
mm , lucky me .
you are lucky .
if the county psych ward hadn &apos;t been filled ,
you wouldn &apos;t have been diverted here to radley .
so , this is luxury ?
compared to county , this is vegas .
what happens next ?
you get a doctor visit to evaluate
your mental state .
what &apos;s the matter with me ?
just curious .
well ...
you &apos;re supposed to have amnesia .
well , if i do , i certainly don &apos;t remember it .
try to get you some extra tapioca .
thanks .
no trouble .
radley .
melissa must have the police looking for spencer by now .
i do not need more police in my life .
yeah , none of us do .
okay , the only thing that counts right now is finding her .
now , are you sure that spencer didn &apos;t say anything
about what she was going to do ?
just that i should stop looking for toby .
what are we supposed to do ,
just sit in our rooms and do our homework ?
we look for her .
we look where the police won &apos;t look ,
because we know her better than them .
like that bookstore that she likes .
or that crazy lab theater at hollis .
we look , we keep talking , and we check in with melissa
in case she hears anything .
mom , you &apos;re not gonna find anything in the paper .
if wilden took time off , he &apos;s not missing yet .
i just wanna see if anyone &apos;s found anything . like a body .
like a body ?
or his car .
hey , well , if they had , there &apos;d be somebody at the front door
long before you &apos;d read about it in the paper .
where is he ?
and what the hell does he want ?
it &apos;s ted .
answer it .
i can &apos;t .
ashley marin &apos;s social secretary .
hi .
yeah , she &apos;s right here ,
she just has her hands in some bread dough .
are you still down for coffee later ?
no ! no , no , no !
absolutely .
great , i &apos;ll tell her .
okay . bye .
why did you do that ?
because
nothing is wrong , and ...
we have to act like we believe it .
god , i want a pretzel .
just put some salt on it .
斯宾塞不在书店
you need some help ?
you know what i hate about arithmetic ?
you can &apos;t charm your way through it .
well , i &apos;m sure that if anyone could , it &apos;d be you .
coffee . coffee solves everything .
i thought that things were
going okay with the new ghost @-@ writing job .
it was , and then ...
things changed .
well , do you have a plan ?
i need something more than freelancing , that &apos;s for sure .
i was actually thinking about teaching again .
i liked it . i &apos;m good at it . i &apos;m just ...
not sure .
i know things haven &apos;t been fun for you .
look , you &apos;re the one who
went from zero to daddy in sixty seconds .
god , i miss you .
why ? i &apos;m right here .
no , i know , but i ...
i still miss you .
spencer ...
olli , olli , oxen free .
good morning , ted .
ashley .
hey , hanna .
hi .
i thought i &apos;d come along . but i &apos;ll pay for my own coffee .
don &apos;t worry about that , i owe you both at least a cup of coffee .
why ?
for connecting me with jamie doyle .
he &apos;s been great .
the steeple &apos;s coming along .
oh , and we should get the bell back
from the foundry tomorrow .
that &apos;s wonderful .
well , let me grab my jacket and we &apos;ll go .
afternoon , padre .
detective wilden .
ashley . hanna .
detective ...
looks like you &apos;re getting a lot of work done .
uh , yes ...
sorry i missed the bell coming down .
i had a couple of days off , went fishing .
catch anything ?
no . but that &apos;s the way fishing works .
sometimes you just have to be patient .
now it &apos;s back to work .
well , maybe you &apos;ll have better luck there .
maybe ...
i &apos;ll be just a minute .

they called me to evaluate a &quot; jane doe &quot;
the park rangers found wandering near a camp ground .
why didn &apos;t you tell them who you are ?
i lost my bag with my wallet and my phone .
and then i knew what would happen
if i did tell them . so i didn &apos;t .
it &apos;s been very nice not being spencer hastings .
even if for only a couple of hours .
what happened in the woods that made you not want to be spencer ?
toby cavanaugh is dead .
i saw his body in the forest .
somebody killed him .
if this is true--
it is true . i saw it .
why didn &apos;t you tell the park rangers ?
because that wouldn &apos;t bring him back .
if someone killed toby--
somebody did kill toby , but i am the reason that he &apos;s dead .
i &apos;m gonna call your family ,
and then i &apos;m going to call the police .
do you understand ?
yes .
okay .
i &apos;ll be right back . stay here .
where have i got to go ?
dad ? hey , can i talk to you ?
sure .
dad , i need to talk to you about ezra .
and he doesn &apos;t know that i &apos;m telling you this ,
and i really probably shouldn &apos;t--
aria .
when i talked to your mom , she told me about ezra .
about the woman in delaware . and the boy .
she thought that i should know .
don &apos;t be angry at her for telling me .
i &apos;m not angry at her . although i should be .
how are you with all of this ?
okay .
mm , not okay , just ... okay .
look , that &apos;s only one of
the reasons that i needed to talk to you .
ezra is taking on these big responsibilities .
and he &apos;s just trying to do the right thing .
and it &apos;s hard , you know , he , he needs money .
and he needs a job .
a job .
teaching .
it &apos;s , it &apos;s what he knows how to do ,
and he &apos;d probably still be a teacher at hollis if ...
things had worked out a little different .
probably .
so , is there something that you can do about this ?
i don &apos;t know .
you don &apos;t know , or ... you don &apos;t know if you &apos;re willing to do it ?
i talked to mom and dad .
they &apos;re trying to get a flight , but the weather &apos;s bad .
everything is grounded from london to spain .
wow . spain too .
they &apos;ll get here as fast as they can .
meanwhile , i will try to get you out .
don &apos;t bother .
don &apos;t bother ?
it &apos;s a 72 @-@ hour evaluation .
it &apos;ll be over by the time they get here .
spencer , what happened ?
how far back do you want me to go ?
right .
i &apos;m on a psych ward , and you &apos;re the one crying .
i &apos;m responsible for you .
it &apos;s okay , melissa .
no , it &apos;s not okay , none of this is okay .
then it &apos;s not okay , it &apos;s all screwed up .
does that make you feel better ?
stop it .
i &apos;m sorry .
all this time , i just thought you were being cruel .
i never thought that you might be ...
unwell .
that &apos;s a big relief for both of us .
melissa wanted me to know that spencer was in radley ,
so she came in on her way out there .
dr. sullivan called her .
what &apos;s sullivan have to do with this ?
sullivan found spencer at radley .
that &apos;s where the rangers sent her .
what ? where was she ?
melissa said that spencer was in the woods all night .
wait , she was just wandering
around in the woods ? why ?
was she looking for toby ?
i don &apos;t know .
you guys , we have to go there .
we have to talk to her .
family visits only .
it &apos;s some kind of mandatory evaluation .
i don &apos;t like the idea of melissa being the only one
that &apos;s able to get in there .
i know . that &apos;s why i left dr. sullivan a message .
what am i taking ?
shotgun antibiotics to knock out any infection .
no tranquilizers , nothing like that ?
no , they need to do a mental evaluation .
can &apos;t do that if you &apos;re under the influence .
down the hatch .
&quot; e. lamb &quot; ?
that &apos;s me .
eddie lamb ? your last name is lamb ?
yep . somewhere in the past ,
i had an ancestor with a flock up some mountain .
my shift &apos;s over .
hang in there .
at least you know you &apos;re not jane doe anymore .
night .
night .
spencer &apos;s hurt ?
why did they take her to radley ?
we don &apos;t know .
they found her at a campsite .
and she &apos;s not allowed visitors because they &apos;re doing some sort of
evaluation on her .
i &apos;m canceling new york .
wait , you &apos;re not gonna go to the seminar ?
mom , you have to go .
it &apos;s not a good time for this .
it &apos;s exactly the right time .
hanna , it &apos;s not just a promotion .
i told you , we &apos;d have to relocate , move to new york .
get out of rosewood .
right .
which means , get away from wilden .
it can &apos;t be that easy , just leaving .
well , i &apos;m a big fan of the easy way .
we can &apos;t just run away .
just go to the seminar . please .
and then we &apos;ll decide what to do later .
i don &apos;t want you alone in this house while i &apos;m gone .
i &apos;ll just stay at emily &apos;s .
mom , it &apos;s only for a few days .
dr. sullivan .
oh , emily . how are you ?
okay ...
the way we left that last session--
we heard about spencer .
she &apos;s all right . she &apos;s safe .
when can we see her ?
not while she &apos;s under observation .
what happened to her ?
did she say why she was out there all alone ?
emily , spencer said she saw a body in the woods .
she thought it was toby .
oh , god ...
the police and the rangers have been looking ,
but they haven &apos;t found anything .
do you think she was lying ?
i think spencer was in an agitated state when they found her .
i &apos;m not certain what she saw .
the police have been trying to contact toby &apos;s family ,
to find out if he &apos;s all right .
do you know where he is ?
no , i don &apos;t .
i thought the toughest thing we were gonna have to deal with
senior year would be her prom dress .
and that is still coming up .
meanwhile ...
meanwhile ...
what are we supposed to do about ezra and his situation ?
uh , are we supposed to do anything ?
aria wants us to .
push comes to shove , and she goes to her parents .
yeah , and we &apos;re not ... useless .
not yet .
mm . i &apos;m the one who got him fired . i could ...
talk to the dean .
do you want to ?
well , he is a good teacher .
other aspects of his character are debatable ,
but yes , he is a good teacher .
something else .
what ?
if we helped him stabilize this new family ,
he might end things with aria .
i suppose that &apos;s true .
but is it a reason to help ?
no ... no ...
no , that &apos;s not right .
i know what i saw , he &apos;s dead .
spencer , why don &apos;t you want to believe that he could be alive ?
because i know what i saw !
the body , did you see the face ?
no !
no , but i know that it was toby !
spencer , i think you took a lot
into that forest with you .
i wanna see my friends .
please , when can i see my friends ?
not during the evaluation . after that ...
after that , what ?
after that , you &apos;ll either be released
or further treatment will be recommended .
i can call emily ,
if you have a message for them .
just ...
tell them that i miss them .
you made it .
can &apos;t stay long . but , uh , you wanted to talk ?
i wanted you to meet someone .
emily fields , missy franklin .
missy , emily .
so , shana was telling me that you swim ?
hello . yes . i swim .
i met missy at the airport in colorado .
no way i wasn &apos;t introducing myself .
she &apos;s headed for philadelphia ,
i thought it &apos;d be fun if you two met .
sit down .
what do you want ? i &apos;ll buy .
um , g @-@ green tea .
so , does rosewood have a good program ?
yeah , pretty good .
the sharks , right ?
right , sharks ...
oh , god , um ... congratulations .
it &apos;s not too late to say congratulations , is it ?
no , it &apos;s never too late to say congratulations . thank you .
you ever lose one of those badges ?
not if you want to keep your job .
they have a chip , right ?
that &apos;s how they work with the doors and stuff ?
you &apos;re asking the kind of questions i &apos;m supposed to report .
i &apos;m just curious .
seventy @-@ two hours .
that &apos;s not long .
you can do that standing on your head . then you &apos;re out .
what if i really am crazy ?
you &apos;re not crazy .
there was some trouble with the old badges .
they had to change the whole system .
what kind of trouble ?
what kind do you think ?
people getting out ? people getting in ?
you want tapioca or vanilla tonight ?
surprise me .
i can &apos;t stop thinking about spencer in that place .
we &apos;ll get her out .
shouldn &apos;t we have seen it coming ?
okay , i have to split myself between disasters .
it &apos;s after three , so i &apos;m thinking about my mom .
hey , if wilden wants to come after you , he will .
it &apos;s not like new york is in some other country .
new york is on another planet .
i don &apos;t know if she &apos;ll get the job , but ...
i want her to have the option in case things get worse .
so , what did wilden tell people about his car ?
emily said he reported it stolen .
don &apos;t you think they &apos;ll find it ?
i mean , don &apos;t all cop cars have gps ?
no , it doesn &apos;t work under water .
it doesn &apos;t ?
nothing works underwater , it &apos;s a scientific fact .
you actually think you &apos;ll go to new york ?
if it &apos;s to keep my mom safe from wilden , then ...
i &apos;ll make the sacrifice .
yeah , i ... hear it &apos;s awful primitive out there .
say cheese !
let me take one of you two .
great .
i have to get going , but send me the video of your meet .
i will . and i &apos;m gonna try
what you said about the cross @-@ over turn .
it works for me . bye , shana . bye , emily
bye .
i didn &apos;t know you swim .
paige didn &apos;t tell you ?
no .
wonder why she never mentioned it .
don &apos;t forget to send me those pictures .
you &apos;ve got my e @-@ mail .
what makes you think this kid stole my i.d. ?
because i saw it . i saw your i.d. with his picture .
w @-@ what would he need it for ?
to see somebody in here .
somebody that he couldn &apos;t just visit because ...
he was doing things for her .
out in the world .
she ?
yeah , the patient &apos;s name was mona vanderwaal .
do you remember her ?
she &apos;s hard to forget .
and the boy .
his real name was toby .
you haven &apos;t touched your pudding .
saving it for later .
delayed gratification . shows discipline . patience .
i &apos;m not so patient .
wasn &apos;t just the badges .
they had a problem with the visitors &apos; passes .
they traced it back to someone on the staff .
who ? who was it ?
i like my job .
i &apos;ve been here since i got out of the navy .
one of the ways that you keep your job
is by keeping your mouth shut .
eddie . it seems like we &apos;re a little bit past that point .
maybe . maybe not .
she was here .
mona vanderwaal .
this was her room .
* will the circle be unbroken ? *
* by and by , by and by *
* there &apos;s a better home awaiting in the sky , in the sky ? *
* will the circle be unbroken ? *
* by and by , by and by *
* there &apos;s a better home awaiting *
* in the sky , in the sky ? *
okay , what do you suppose loser mona was doing in there ?
praying for bigger boobs ?
why do you even bother going to church ?
i like to cover my bets .
what is that ?
you were writing in it all during service .
it &apos;s my diary .
since when do you keep a diary ?
since forever .
let me see .
okay .
no , you &apos;re gonna have to wait till after .
till after what ?
after i &apos;m dead .
ew , don &apos;t be so gruesome !
i &apos;m not being gruesome , i &apos;m being mysterious .
forget it . i don &apos;t want to read your stupid diary , anyway .
yes , you do .
i &apos;m writing them for you .
&quot; them &quot; ?
they &apos;re beyond scandalous .
you &apos;re gonna need them
if you &apos;re gonna carry on after i &apos;m gone .
carry on with what ?
fresh muffins at the bakery . come on !
here you go .
thank you .
please , have a seat .
i didn &apos;t send her to ask for any favors .
no , i know that .
i @-@ i didn &apos;t swear her to secrecy about what &apos;s going on ,
but i never told her to ask for help .
i don &apos;t want you or ella to think that i would do that .
w @-@ we know that you didn &apos;t .
and i &apos;m sorry she put you in that position .
oh , don &apos;t be angry at aria . she wanted to help .
oh , no , i @-@ i &apos;m not angry with her , i couldn &apos;t be .
there are just things about this situation
that i haven &apos;t been able to explain to her .
well . pride is a tricky thing .
why did you come here today ?
i talked to the dean .
i wanted to see if there was room
in the department for you .
and , uh , i &apos;m afraid that there isn &apos;t .
but i still want to help you , if i can .
because ?
could just be habit .
i have reached a point in my life
where i spend a great deal of time
trying to make some kind of amends
to someone for ... something .
there &apos;s no shortage of bad judgment in this world .
tell me about your son .
you got all kinds of secret talents .
i don &apos;t play so much anymore .
my sister and i used to play four @-@ handed pieces .
but that was a long time ago .
toby &apos;s not a name you hear everyday .
no , it &apos;s not .
i &apos;ve known one toby in my life .
nice kid .
i met him when his mother was a patient here .
my toby &apos;s name was cavanaugh . what about yours ?
be a hell of a coincidence if it was the same toby , wouldn &apos;t it ?
yes , it would .
do you believe in coincidences ?
not as much as i used to .
excuse me ...
hi there . what &apos;s the number on file for the ...
keep practicing .
just a minute , and i &apos;ll get it for you .
we could just say that we &apos;re spencer &apos;s cousins .
hanna , nobody &apos;s ever gonna believe that .
we have to find out
why she &apos;s so sure toby &apos;s dead .
well , they have to let her out after 72 hours .
no , they don &apos;t have to let her go at all if she &apos;s really ...
you know ...
what are you saying ?
i &apos;m saying , &quot; a &quot; has been turning the screws so long ,
one of us was bound to snap a string .
just never thought that it would be spencer .
i did .
why ?
because there &apos;s a downside to being too smart .
you were never the weak link , emily .
spencer was .
so , where &apos;s the fourth musketeer ?
haven &apos;t seen her today .
if you mean spencer ,
i think you know exactly where she is , she &apos;s in radley ,
and you &apos;re the reason why .
radley ?
don &apos;t play dumb , mona .
could &apos;ve gotten through senior year and been finished ,
but you wouldn &apos;t leave it alone .
listen to me--
no , you listen .
if spencer doesn &apos;t get better , and she doesn &apos;t get out of radley ,
you &apos;re gonna wish you broke your neck
when you fell off that cliff .
attention .
aria montgomery , report to the principal &apos;s office .
aria montgomery , to the office
this is a compmpletely informal conversation .
i want to make sure that we avoid any ...
misunderstandings or miscommunications .
okay ...
ezra fitz has applied to the school district
as a substitute teacher .
if his application is approved ,
he will probably , at some point ,
be assigned to cover a class here .
it &apos;s come to my attention that ...
since mr. fitz left rosewood high ,
you have seen him .
occasionally .
in a social context .
yes
the school has no interest in the ...
personal lives of pupils .
but under the ... unusual circumstances ,
i feel that i have to ask .
are you currently seeing ezra fitz ?
seeing him socially ?
no , i &apos;m not .
i @-@ i saw him ...
after he left rosewood high . socially . a few times .
um , i suppose it might have looked like something that it wasn &apos;t .
which it wasn &apos;t .
there was never any question of it ...
being anything serious .
i &apos;m glad you both realized that before things ...
went too far .
yeah . it &apos;s definitely a good thing .
otherwise , it might have been a little ...
awkward ?
yes . very awkward .
i &apos;m sorry if this was embarrassing , but , uh ...
i wouldn &apos;t be doing my job if i didn &apos;t ask .
no , i &apos;m glad that i could clear things up for you .
and you have .
good .
small world , isn &apos;t it ?
well , they call it training ,
but it &apos;s more of an assessment .
to see if you can do the job .
i &apos;m sorry to cancel so late , but ...
the bank only does this twice a year .
nah , that &apos;s okay . it &apos;s , it &apos;s important .
and i &apos;ll only be gone a couple of days ...
this time .
this time ?
yeah , if it works out ,
i will be ... taking hanna to new york with me .
so the promotion wouldn &apos;t be here .
no , it &apos;s in new york .
well ... when would you go , if they offer it to you ?
i &apos;d have to make the decision pretty quickly .
miss the great unveiling ...
we can come back for that .
well , i should wish you luck .
but i don &apos;t think i can right now .
wouldn &apos;t feel honest .
i like seeing you .
right here .
i like seeing you .
if there was some other reason ,
for you leaving , besides the promotion ...
would you tell me about it ?
this is the only reason .
&quot; if . &quot; would you tell me ?
because maybe i could do something about it .
i &apos;d like to try . if you &apos;d want me to .
there &apos;s nothing you have to worry about .
are you sure you don &apos;t want a cookie ?
no . thank you .
okay .
i brought them for sybil .
she was my favorite nurse . very kind .
it &apos;s important to reward kindness .
i bet you were surprised to see me .
you &apos;re taking a big risk .
coming here . talking to me .
just visiting a friend .
why did you kill toby ?
what did that get you ?
that &apos;s an interesting question .
if it were true , if i killed him ,
why would i want to talk to you ?
look at all that &apos;s happened since you turned me down
on our little drive up the mountain .
all the pain and disappointment and loss ,
because you were stubborn .
but i believe in second chances .
i &apos;m a generous person .
no , you &apos;re not .
you wouldn &apos;t be here if you didn &apos;t need something .
whatever it is , mona , the answer &apos;s no .
ali was never pregnant .
she thought she was , and she panicked ,
but it was a false alarm .
no way you can be sure of that .
ali told me .
i have her diaries . remember ?
i don &apos;t have all of them , but ...
i have most of them .
and i know where the rest of them are .
i have the answers , spencer .
i have the answers to questions you haven &apos;t even thought of .
leave me alone .
you have all these bits and pieces .
you &apos;re trying to put together a jig @-@ saw puzzle ,
but you &apos;ve never seen the picture on the front of the box .
you need me .
otherwise , you &apos;ll never really know anything for sure .
go away !
before i start choking you again .
mona , i &apos;ve got nothing left to lose .
they already think that i &apos;m crazy .
you &apos;re not crazy .
you &apos;re as sane as i am .
your mom should have the contact info .
i will call you as soon i get to the hotel .
okay .
don &apos;t worry , mom . i &apos;ll be fine ,
we &apos;ll be okay , mrs. marin .
i love you .
i love you .
geez , did you pack enough for three days ?
if i forgot something , i can always go back .
ignore him .
hanna , you don &apos;t have to talk to him .
you know what , emily ?
sometimes you poke the bear ,
and other times , the bear pokes you .
it &apos;s from a movie .
hello .
hello .
are you following me ? me and my mom ?
why would i do that ?
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m just wondering if you are .
no , i &apos;m not following you .
well , then go away .
i went away .
right . you went fishing .
that &apos;s right .
and now i &apos;m back .
and while i was away , i did some thinking .
you , me , and your mother . it &apos;s complicated .
i don &apos;t think any of us have been
completely honest with each other about things .
honesty is tough .
yeah , but you could make that easier on everybody , hanna .
and how could i do that ?
the car , hanna .
the car ?
just give me the keys , and tell me where you left it .
that &apos;s all you have to do .
and then there &apos;s no more trouble from me .
all i want from you and your mother is that car .
i knew who i was when they found me .
and i knew that my family and friends would be worried .
but i just ...
i wanted to fold up and stop .
i didn &apos;t , i didn &apos;t wanna think anymore .
you were overwhelmed .
yeah , well , i wasn &apos;t spencer hastings
for almost a whole day , and ...
nobody else showed up to take the job , so ...
guess i &apos;m stuck with it .
because you &apos;re the only person in the world that can be you .
you don &apos;t have to rub it in .
i &apos;m sorry , this can &apos;t be very entertaining .
i mean , there are people here with real problems .
just like you .
yeah , just like me .
i , uh ...
i fell down in the woods .
when i was running .
i fell down , and i looked at the ground , and i ...
saw my hand , and my sleeve , and ...
the little button on my sleeve .
and some dirt ,
and an old acorn , and i said to myself :
&quot; okay , if this is the last thing that you ever see ,
i can handle that .
i &apos;m done .
i &apos;ve had enough . &quot;
but it wasn &apos;t the last thing that i saw .
i just kept going .
how do you keep going
when the worst thing has happened ?
what do you have to change inside to survive ?
who do you have to become ?
i &apos;m sorry , i don &apos;t expect you guys to understand .
you don &apos;t know me .
i &apos;m sorry , but that &apos;s true .
you don &apos;t know who i am anymore .
and you can &apos;t count on me .
