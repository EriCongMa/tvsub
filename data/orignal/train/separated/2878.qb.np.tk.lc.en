oh , you know what ?
no .
wait a second .
i know it &apos;s in here . -you know what ? i &apos;m good .
sorry , i guess it &apos;s in my big bag .
say , does anybody have a goldfish ?
why are you here ? shouldn &apos;t you be at work ?
they sent me home .
they said i can &apos;t work if i &apos;m sick .
sorry you &apos;re sick .
i &apos;m not sick !
i don &apos;t get sick .
getting sick is for weaklings , it &apos;s for pansies .
no one thinks that you &apos;re a pansy ...
but we do think that you need a tissue .
i have not been sick in over three years .
i think you &apos;re sick because that used to be in your nose .
i &apos;ll get tissue.i don &apos;t need a tissue . i &apos;m fine @-@ d .
when you put a d at the end of fine ... you &apos;re not fine .
i &apos;m fine @-@ d.i &apos;m fine @-@ d .
it &apos;s a really hard word to say .
yes ?
hi . is rachel here ? i &apos;m her sister .
oh , my god , jill ! oh , my god , rachel !
oh , my god , introduce us .
this is chandler . and you know monica and ross .
and that &apos;s phoebe . and that &apos;s joey .
how you doing ?
don &apos;t !
honey , what are you doing here ?
which sister is this ? is this the spoiled one or the one that bit her ?
daddy cut me off.never mind , i got it .
you know what i said ? i said , &quot; i &apos;ll hire a lawyer ,
sue you , take all your money ... and cut you off ! &quot;
wow . what did he say ? that he wouldn &apos;t pay for my lawyer .
then he told me to learn the value of money ... from the one daughter he &apos;s actually proud of .
did you hear that ? my dad &apos;s proud of me.my dad &apos;s proud of me .
rach ?
oh , yeah . sorry .
honey , so what did you do that made dad cut you off ?
okay , i bought a boat.you bought a boat ?
it wasn &apos;t for me , it was for a friend .
boy , did we make friends with the wrong sister .
i knew it was stupid and i shouldn &apos;t have done it ...
but she bought me all these cds and said i had a cute haircut .
and your daddy didn &apos;t understand ?
i know , and usually i just cry and say i &apos;m sorry and he forgives me .
oh , yes , good criers , the green girls .
i mean , the green sisters .
man , no matter how you say it ... it still sounds like you &apos;re talking about green people .
i &apos;m at rock bottom .
this is the best thing that could &apos;ve happened to you .
you &apos;ve needed to get out on your own .
when i did it , at first i was scared , but then look at me now .
i am the only daughter that dad is proud of .
i can &apos;t believe him . how does he expect me to buy stuff ?
maybe , you know , you won &apos;t buy stuff for a while.i don &apos;t understand .
this is what you &apos;ll do . you &apos;re gonna get a job.you &apos;re gonna get an apartment .
and then you will live off the money that you earn .
okay , i know this is what you did ... but that doesn &apos;t sound like me .
okay , but it can be . it can be you .
and you can stay with us . right , phoebe ?
of course , yeah .
oh , that &apos;s so great !
okay , i &apos;m really gonna do this . i don &apos;t know how to thank you .
oh , i like cars .
you all finished ?
yes.-great.
okay , here are the tips for this morning.jen gets 50,50 for me
and joey owes 8 dollars .
what ?
for all the free food you gave away .
if it &apos;s free , how come you &apos;re charging me for it ?
we don &apos;t give anything away unless it &apos;s a birthday .
what if they came in third in a modeling contest ?
no .
sorry .
i just had the hardest day . some of these are so heavy .
how did you pay ? i thought your dad took your credit card .
i memorized those numbers when i was 15 .
but look at all the cool make @-@ it @-@ on @-@ my @-@ own stuff i got !
this is my &quot; please hire me &quot; sweater .
and these are my &quot; don &apos;t you want to rent me this apartment ? &quot; pants .
charging clothes to your dad doesn &apos;t qualify as making it on your own .
oh , mr. scientist has to get all technical .
rachel &apos;s not gonna think it &apos;s a good idea .
so who made her queen of the world ?
i would love that job !
what &apos;s going on ?
jill ! did you shop ?
no.they did .
yeah , we went shopping !
you went shopping ?
then you came here and paraded it under jill &apos;s nose ... when you know she &apos;s trying to quit .
that &apos;s terrible .
sorry , jill .
so , what &apos;d you get ?
oh , well , all right . thank you.i got this , you know , &quot; i want a job &quot; sweater .
and then i got .. these are apartment pants .
apartment pants ?
you &apos;ve never heard of them ?
of course i &apos;ve heard of them .
ross , what &apos;d you get ?
i got this ... this .
a pashmina ?
yeah !
i love these babies .
really ? what &apos;s a pashmina ?
it &apos;s a rug .
jill ?
i &apos;m sorry , rachel .
you think that &apos;s gonna work on me ? i invented that .
right ! but i am sorry .
it &apos;s okay . one little setback is okay.but don &apos;t let it happen again , okay ?
okay .
now , since daddy paid for all this stuff , i should take it all away .
but i &apos;m just gonna take the pashmina .
and the pants .
i &apos;ll take it all , because that way , you &apos;ll learn the lesson .
alrighty.i &apos;m gonna run a couple of errands and i will see you at dinner .
she took all my stuff .
yeah . everything but the little blue one .
that &apos;s the best one ! oh , my god . thank you so much !
oh , my gosh , that was so lame . like a pashmina could be a rug .
oh , yeah ? how about you with the &quot; i &apos;m sorry &quot; ?
shut up ! i wasn &apos;t like that at all .
what about what i said about the apartment pants ? how dumb was l ?
were you this cute in high school ?
oh , stop .
no , you stop .
no , you stop .
you stop
why don &apos;t i sit here and then you &apos;ll both stop it ?
okay . so , what do you want to do ? let &apos;s do something crazy
i know , let &apos;s rest and drink lots of fluids .
okay , i &apos;ll rest .
but if i &apos;m going to bed , then you &apos;re coming with me .
see , that would be impossible to resist if you weren &apos;t all ... drippy here .
are you saying that you don &apos;t want to get with this ?
i don &apos;t think you should say that even when you &apos;re healthy .
come on .
don &apos;t take this personally.i just can &apos;t have sex with a sick person .
i &apos;m with you . i can &apos;t have sex with a sick person either . disgusting !
but i &apos;m not sick ! let me prove it to you .
we are two healthy people in the prime of lime .
see , that &apos;s the thing , i would like to stay in the &quot; prime of lime . &quot;
oh , okay , now i &apos;ll do it .
hey . what &apos;s up ?
i think there &apos;s something you should know .
better not be about the apartment pants.i just pitched the idea to my boss at ralph lauren and she loved it .
no . it &apos;s just , i was ... i was with ross and jill after you left ...
and i &apos;m pretty sure i saw a little spark between them .
what ?
i mean , it &apos;s probably nothing .
but i wanted to warn you that there might be something .
with ross and jill ?
yeah .
with ross and my sister ?
yes
with my sister jill and my ex @-@ boyfriend ross ?
yes
oh , there is no way .
okay , then .
oh , my god ! i cannot believe that !
i don &apos;t like it when he dates anyone , but my sister ? isn &apos;t that incest or something ?
and they &apos;re gonna have sex .
oh , no ! what if he marries her too ?
this is just terrible . this is just terrible .
and i can &apos;t stop it . i don &apos;t own ross .
and jill should be able to do what she wants to do .
oh , my god , i can &apos;t believe ross is marrying my little sister .
this is the worst thing that could &apos;ve ever happened to me .
but great news about the apartment pants , huh ?
that &apos;ll be $ 3.85 .
what ? yesterday you said i was too pretty to pay .
it &apos;s just , i can &apos;t , because my manager said that i ..

yeah ?
so you guys talked ? so you get along ? so you &apos;re gonna go out ?

god , no . what would make you think that ?
phoebe said she thought she saw something between you guys.i mean , he &apos;s nice .
he &apos;s the kind you &apos;re friends with , but not the kind you date .
he &apos;s the kind you date , because you did .
but me ? not so much .
oh , not so much . what do you mean ? is there something wrong with ross ?
no , no , no . he &apos;s just ... i don &apos;t know . you know , he &apos;s just a little bookish .
are you saying he &apos;s a geek ? you think so too ?
no . ross is not a geek .
then let &apos;s just say he &apos;s not my type .
handsome is not your type ?
smart , kind , good kisser.what , those things aren &apos;t on your list ?
ross is great . you &apos;d be lucky to be with him .
if it means that much , then i &apos;ll ask him out .
oh , no . that &apos;s not what i meant .
you know what ? you &apos;re right.he has been really nice to me .
yeah , but he &apos;s not your type .
but maybe that &apos;s good .
i &apos;m doing all these different things.maybe i should just try dating a geek too .
yeah , but you don &apos;t want to try too much too fast .
you remember what happened to the little girl who ... tried too much too fast , don &apos;t you ?
