ah ... three more , cocktail johnny .
schmidt , that is melon @-@ flavored liquor .
it &apos;s 4 proof , okay ? that is safe to drink while you &apos;re pregnant .
melon balls .
schmidt , no matter how much you get drunk ,
cece &apos;s still gonna be engaged .
now , i know you &apos;re down about it .
i &apos;m not down about cece .
this is , this is a mess . listen ,
there are plenty of things to be down about :
the air pollution in china , the deficit ,
the hobbit wasn &apos;t very good .
if i want to see dwarves in a real @-@ time dinner scene ,
i would &apos;ve gone to koreatown . booyah ! ball me .
ball you ?
ball me !
what are you ...
how do you get these toppy things off , nick ?
oh , schmidt ... you look like a lab rat .
okay , you know what ?
i &apos;m adding that to your bill .
what the hell is this ?
what ? ! you &apos;re giving us a check ?
no more free drinks .
i didn &apos;t even know you had these here .
take all of my money and then get out of my room .
you guys , come on .
show a little respect . this is my job .
nick , i saw you pee in the register .
yeah , once . you think i was sober for that ?
you once put a sign out that said
&quot; take a drink , leave a drink . &quot;
okay , it &apos;s the only job i have , and i &apos;m trying to be ... good .
okay ? it &apos;s about time i got a little responsibility .
responsibility ?
i thought of a new promotion .
it &apos;s like ladies &apos; night ,
but it &apos;s the opposite : it &apos;s guys &apos; night .
the new manager loved the idea , and if it goes well--
maybe there &apos;s a promotion ,
i can start moving up in the world .
what ?
i want him .
i want him ... bad .
what is this ?
i think nick being ambitious and driven
about the bar is making me ...
want him more . is that , like , a thing ?
no . no woman &apos;s ever been attracted to power and success .
it &apos;s just like ...
i thought it was one kiss and then it was over .
hey , sorry , i &apos;m just putting a load on .
got a shift at the bar .
you know that there &apos;s a separate compartment
to put the soap in ?
i didn &apos;t know that .
little soap house .
anyway , i &apos;m getting this mess cleaned up .
i gotta say , it feels really good .
do any of you guys know where the iron is ?
get out ! what ?
i want to iron my button @-@ down .
get out , nick ! get out .
what is happening right now ?
why are you being so mean to me ?
get out !
what is going on with you ?
there &apos;s a new manager , that &apos;s why i &apos;m making you guys pay .
and you actually care about what he thinks ?
hey , shane .
hey , guys . this is shane . this is my new manager .
oh , got it .
i &apos;m really excited to have her here .
we &apos;re really getting this place in order . we &apos;re , uh ...
makes a lot more sense now .
god , i can &apos;t stop thinking about the other night .
hope you gave that bar an extra wipe @-@ down .
you &apos;re just like the opposite
of everyone i went to business school with .
i mean , look at you . you &apos;re just ... you &apos;re so real .
yeah .
oh , yeah . he &apos;s incredibly real .
as real as they get .
yeah , the realest .
shut up , both of you .
you &apos;re a mess .
yeah . i got dirt on my face after we made out .
god , i loved it . get back to work .
you got it .
get back to work !
i &apos;m joking . no , but seriously .
yeah . joke . seriously ,
get back to work . yeah .
get back to work . yeah .
i know this isn &apos;t gonna end well ,
but the whole middle part &apos;s gonna be awesome .
good for you .
schmidt , stop drinking that .
i &apos;m gonna take care of this .
if i feel down , i come here .
i love this place , man . you know , the sound of bubbles ,
soothing synth music .
if this place doesn &apos;t take your mind off of cece ,
then i don &apos;t know , man .
look at that .
so beautiful .
and exotic .
perfect curves .
giant almond eyes .
caramel @-@ colored stripes .
sumptuous lips .
are you talking about the fish ?
excuse me . you , sir , that works here .
what is this fish-- the one that floats like an angel ?
how much for this one ?
ah , that is the lovely but elusive california lionfish .
it &apos;s perfect . i must have it .
s @-@ sadly , sir , you can &apos;t .
what do you mean i can &apos;t ?
it &apos;s ... illegal , sir .
this fish is protected by the great state of california .
gimme it !
no ... ?
what are you doing ?
why can &apos;t i have the things that i want ?
sorry about that .
don &apos;t look at the fish , kids .
you can &apos;t have any of them !
none of them are for sale !
love is a lie . it is .
calm down !
love is a lie . love is a lie .
we &apos;re leaving . we &apos;re leaving .
oh , you &apos;ve got to be kidding me .
schmidt , no . absolutely not .
no ! i don &apos;t trust fish .
they breathe water-- that &apos;s crazy .
yeah , he &apos;s got a whole thing going .
schmidt-- an aquarium ? !
when did you become a bond villain
that couldn &apos;t afford not to live with roommates ?
this is where i will keep my lionfish .
your lionfish ?
a rare beauty .
the result of generations
of interracial fish breeding .
just undulating in that water with that wry smile .
perfect , round fish breasts .
pull it together .
what is this hat ?
they say it &apos;ll be impossible for me to have it .
but i &apos;ll get it . she will be mine , and ...
we will create a life together .
we &apos;re not talking about fish here , are we ?
no .
clearly talking about cece .
yes .
yeah , &apos; cause he said &quot; fish breasts . &quot;
he said &quot; fish breasts . &quot;
i mean , fish don &apos;t have boobs .
hey , jess .
that &apos;s my name . what &apos;s yours ?
just kidding . i know what it is . it &apos;s nick .
you okay ?
yeah .
you haven &apos;t stopped moving since we &apos;ve been talking .
it &apos;s a nice @-@ looking dress . you look good in it .
oh , god . okay .
jess ! jess , wait !
jess ... jess , would you please wait ?
hey , i was wondering ,
can i get a ride to the hardware store ?
i want to throw a punching bag up
at the bar for guys &apos; night ,
but my car &apos;s not working , so can i get a ride ?
no . no .
come on , can i please have a ride ?
wait , hold on . don &apos;t move . hold on .
you got an eyelash .
why do you smell so good ?
it &apos;s &apos; cause i did laundry .
ah . i smell like a baby in a damn meadow .
look at this . my underwear .
they &apos;re blue now .
i think it &apos;s &apos; cause i put colors in the whites .
i &apos;m still figuring it out ,
but i &apos;m really excited about laundry .
good job .
hey , how do you put your underwear back in ?
just ...
i feel like it &apos;s too big to get back in now .
it &apos;s tricky to get it in .
fine !
thank you .
do you mind if we stop along the way ?
i &apos;m thinking of getting a salad
&apos;cause i want to eat healthier .
oh ! god ! nick !
i &apos;m thinking of taking a vitamin today .
oh , god ! shut up !
it &apos;s good .
yeah .
yank that chain .
yank it .
i feel like russell crowe in every movie he &apos;s ever done .
all right , nick . um , we have to go .
we just got here .
we have tons of stuff we need to get .
fine .
let me see what we have left .
a whole bunch of stuff .
long @-@ shafted ... drive drill ?
new nut wrench ?
our old nut wrench is bad .
quick @-@ hardening ... caulk .
you don &apos;t want to wait forever for that caulk to harden .
lube for ... drill shaft .
and we-- also , can we get a box of gummy sharks ?
just remember ... you caught him pleasuring himself
to a mail @-@ order steak catalogue .
hey , jess , i need the cart !
look what i found !
look at this big ol &apos; pipe .
check it out , schmidt-- i got you a clownfish .
i don &apos;t want some janky freshwater bitch fish , winston .
i want a lionfish .
let &apos;s just cut through the crap , okay , schmidt .
we both know what you really want is cece .
cece the woman ?
yeah .
you can &apos;t put a woman in a fish tank , winston .
that doesn &apos;t make any sense .
look , winston , if there was
one thing that stood between you and happiness ,
don &apos;t you think i would be there to help you get it ?
no matter how stupid it was ?
you &apos;re right , schmidt .
if i was doing something stupid ,
you definitely would be involved .
yeah , you &apos;re damn right i would be .
and i would probably be there to make it even stupider .
now , i &apos;m going to walk out that door ,
and i &apos;m gonna purse the object of my dreams .
and if you don &apos;t want to join me ,
then i &apos;m gonna carry that weight alone .
i &apos;m in .
let &apos;s get you a lionfish . where do we start ?
we &apos;re gonna start at the source .
the ocean .
that &apos;s an even better idea .
hey , jess .
i got some hot soup .
i feel good ...
jessy feel good ...
i like to say words with my mouth .
well , your jaw is super bruised ,
so you need to get some rest .
but you have some fun pain meds .
right ?
i like you .
yeah , i like you , too , jess .
yeah ... and i like , your little bubble belly .
oh , thank you .
blows up like a ... bubble .
yeah , that &apos;s what it does .
i want to have sex with you !
okay .
i want to have sex with you .
whoa , do you know what you &apos;re saying right now , jess ?
yeah .
are you sure ?
i want to have sex with you .
sexy time for you , says me .
you are a beautiful white man , nick miller .
okay .
read all about it .
yeah .
i &apos;m judy garland .
yeah , so it &apos;s the pills .
this is nonsense .
whoa ! jess , hey , hey , hey , no , no , no , no , no ...
heck , no ... no ...
don &apos;t do this right now .
i &apos;m judy garland .
hey , judy , let &apos;s get you to bed , doll .
whoa , whoa ! you are way too drugged @-@ up for this ... okay ...
this little piggy went to the market .
that little piggy can &apos;t be touched by you right now .
this little piggy went ...
this little piggy went to market !
it &apos;s hot ! i put my hand in the hot soup !
ow ! you ... aah !
hey , nick !
will you be a doll and get me some mustard ?
that is not flattering on you .
you &apos;re an incredibly lovely man .
are you calling my phone ?
yeah , i &apos;m calling it right now , winston .
i can &apos;t find it .
are you kidding me ?
damn it , winston ,
it take me 20 minutes to fit this thing with your ...
whoa , ok , hey ! careful ! hey ! what are you ...
why is your waist so weird ?
that &apos;s my ass cheek ! sch @-@ schmidt !
i &apos;m getting your phone .
that kind of tickles .
hey ! stop saying
&quot; that &apos;s my ass cheek &quot; and stop touching his butt !
look at that shiner .
not cool !
somebody messes with my boy , that means we mean &quot; bid @-@ ness &quot; !
we doing this ? let &apos;s do this !
are we not ... are we not doing it ?
it doesn &apos;t feel like you guys want to do it .
let &apos;s just say hypothetically
that a girl says something to you while she &apos;s on painkillers .
and that girl says that she might want to
have sexual intercourse with you .
please tell me we &apos;re not talking about jess .
and you had no idea that &apos;s how she felt .
like , no idea .
you thought the door was closed .
in fact , you thought that door was so closed
that you went out to another door ,
but had i known that the first door was open ,
that &apos;s the door i wanted to walk through .
wait , okay , wait ...
i would &apos;ve walked through that door .
do you see how i &apos;m in a tough spot ?
can we stop calling it &quot; walking through a door &quot; ?
because for me , i feel like it &apos;s more like sliding past a drape .
okay , if a girl on painkillers says
that she wants to have sex with you ,
is that the drugs or is that real ?
and if so , how do i end it with shane before jess finds out ?
i @-@ i @-@ i meant the door .
nick , jess ...
all right , good talking , guys .
good stuff . yeah , i love that .
hey , guys .
what happened to your eye ?
you smashed me in the face , remember ?
right here .
that &apos;s funny .
seriously , what happened ?
is your jaw okay ?
oh , you know what ?
i can &apos;t even feel it .
the doctor &apos;s got me so goofy on these painkillers ,
it &apos;s like it never happened .
it &apos;s like it never happened .
but i sure got a chin shiner .
yeah , you do .
right ?
so , i &apos;ll see you at guys &apos; night .
uh , no , no , no , you ... i don &apos;t ...
i think you should rest .
yeah , girl , you gotta protect that face .
yeah , hey , for real , you should stay home
and you should rest , jess .
that &apos;s so sweet .
thanks , guys .
what are doing out here ?
this is crazy .
we &apos;ve been standing in the ocean for two hours
trying to steal an illegal fish .
i don &apos;t know why you want that damn fish so bad .
but what i do know is that it &apos;s gonna make you happy .
and that &apos;s all i care about .
remember , i &apos;m the one who shaved your shoulders
after you got that scoop @-@ neck sweater .
i appreciate it .
i &apos;d do the same to find whatever it is that makes you happy .
you want to lose that last 55 pounds ,
i &apos;ll help you do that .

jess , wait !
what are you doing here ?
he left me a voicemail from the ambulance .
he was rambling a lot , but i brought him this .
whoa , where &apos;d you get that ?
you know , one of the perks of being a model .
you get to meet a lot of sketchy people .
the guy who got me this also said he could get me
a box of dolphin steaks or a mostly white baby .
good to know .
how &apos;s he doing ?
uh , hey , listen ,
i think it might be good for him
if you just gave him some space .
space ?
cece , you &apos;re getting married .
it &apos;s killing him .
okay .
yeah .
um , just tell him i came ...
mm @-@ hmm .
by , or ... or not .
he &apos;s waking up . you should go .
okay .
you know ... roommate .
winston .
i just realized something .
it was never about a fish .
it was a metaphor .
it was about cece .
don &apos;t feel bad about not seeing it .
look , man , it was subtle as hell .
oh , my god , is that a lionfish ?
where &apos;d that come from ?
the lion ... the lionfish ?
you . that came from you .
when the paramedics came , you ...
you had it in your hand .
they were like , &quot; whoa , you can &apos;t get one of these . &quot;
and i was like , &quot; he caught it in a ... &quot; you did it .
hello , fish cece .
gonna put you back in the sea .
i &apos;m sorry , what ?
look , winston , i don &apos;t know if it was the jellyfish &apos;s venom
or the paramedic &apos;s urine , but it made me realize ...
... she &apos;s not mine to keep .
she belongs out there .
in the great , wide open ocean .
uh , schmidt , that don &apos;t go to the ocean .
what are you , the city planner ?
well , i &apos;ve got some explaining to do .

hey , jess ...
last night ,
when you were on pills ...
... you said you want me .
shut up .
you put your hand in my pocket .
no , i didn &apos;t ...
you said &quot; this little piggy wants to go to the market . &quot;
shut up , nick .
it &apos;s something you were just saying ,
that &apos;s fine , that &apos;s cool ,
we &apos;ll move on and not talk about it ,
but it is something that i &apos;ve thought a lot about .
but you were never clear about that ,
so that there were other options .
and this little piggy ran around to different markets ,
but he didn &apos;t know .
what are you talking about ?
do you want to have sex with me , yes or no ?
yes !
no ! yes ! i mean , i did .
but that was before i knew that you were ...
you were doing all that for your boss , so you sleep with her .
fine , forget- forget the boss .
okay .
well , i just , you know , i thought it was ...
it was nice to see you actually trying at something .
so ...
that &apos;s why you were more attracted to me ?
wait a second .
i thought it was attractive that you were trying .
that &apos;s why ?
you &apos;re a frickin &apos; gold digger , jess .
what ? !
i think that &apos;s what you just said .
if i were a gold digger ,
do you think i &apos;d be interested in you ?
i would be the worst gold digger in the world .
you &apos;re a friggin &apos; gold digger .
no , i &apos;m not , nick .
i &apos;m so disappointed in you .
shut up !
i &apos;m not a gold digger .
then prove it .
ow ! my jaw .

then move your damn head .
then kiss me like a man !
damn it !
what &apos;s wrong with your hand ?
i burnt it in your damn soup . is that what you wanted ...
well , who burns their hand in soup ?

you &apos;re a mess !
you are so annoying with your little shorts .
why are you so angry all the time ?
i told you , shut up .
shut up and take off your clothes right now .
and i mean it , take off your clothes .
you &apos;re just chaotic . everywhere you go .
stop talking !
wherever you go ! you are--
this is not the time to talk ,
that is the stupidest thing ...
i &apos;m gonna grab some paper towels .
an aquarium the size of a sixth grader just broke ,
and you &apos;re grabbing paper towels ?
yes , i &apos;m getting paper towels .
what are you thinking ? !
okay , you know what ?
i &apos;m out .
you can &apos;t clean this up with paper towels .
i &apos;m not ...
you don &apos;t want to clean it up .
no , that &apos;s not what it is .
well , you know what ?
if you &apos;re not cleaning it up ,
i do not want to be told
i &apos;m not cleaning it up .
what to do , by you , right this second !
i &apos;m not ... just &apos; cause i &apos;m a woman ?
that &apos;s it ! i &apos;m out !

you piss me off !
this is a bad idea .
i know you &apos;re going out into the ocean

and should you meet a charming ...
physically fit , what-- i don &apos;t know , whatever kind of fish
gefilte fish come from ...
