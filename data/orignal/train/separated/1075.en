They want me in D.C.?
The job's yours.
I can't leave until I know the whole truth,
until I really know
what happened to david siegel that day.
I'd like to request a book for study.
Mosconi claimed that the greatest wealth in the world
was within its pages.
You're gonna steal it for me.
There's something you should know about me.
I'm not an FBI agent. I'm a criminal informant.
All the pages held hidden symbols,
culminating with a picture of an idol.
This is the idol of sita.
The idol had eyes made out of rare diamonds.
The hope diamond-- we're looking for its twin.
It's a forgery. It's a good one.
The initials c.H.-- Curtis Hagen.
We're going after the Dutchman again.
Hagen.
I found this in Hagen's wallet.
Hagen was watching someone all day and taking notes.
It could be whoever shot him.
That's the same block where we found Siegel's body.
Neal, who's listed in apartment three?
Wait. Electronic trip wire.
Someone has been studying you.
Not just me.
This is everyone who's in my division.
Whoever murdered Siegel also framed Hagen.
Probably killed him as well.
This is Rebecca's apartment.
Who is she, Neal?
Let me guess-- she never invited you over.
It's outside my radius.
I bet that's why she chose it. Who is this woman?
I have no idea.
We have to leave, right now.
She doesn't know we were here, and we need to keep it that way.
I'm staying here.
And then what, you'll confront her,
convince her to tell you everything?
Or you could bring her in, question her.
On what grounds?
I don't have a warrant or hard evidence.
We don't know what we're dealing with here.
We leave, regroup, and figure out what to do.
Siegel died six blocks from here.
Somehow, he must have been onto Rebecca.
Talk, now.
I told you--
Hagen was threatening her.
At least I thought he was.
Instead, he was working with her.
Siegel must have found out about it and followed her here.
She sees Siegel, realizes her cover's blown,
shoots him on the way back to his car.
She killed him.
Neal, we will not let her get away with this,
but you need to tell me everything.
I mean everything.
Hagen was looking for a lost treasure
that Mosconi hid a hundred years ago.
The same Mosconi from the Gershon exhibit?
Where I met Rebecca.
I approached her for information on Mosconi...
exactly like Hagen wanted me to.
They played me from the start.
What's so valuable that they went through all this?
The lost twin to the hope diamond.
The motion detector at the door
is an electronic trip wire.
It's a custom job, from all appearances.
The windows are wired too. It's professional work.
We don't know much about this woman,
Rebecca Lowe,
But as of now, she's the prime suspect
in the murders of Curtis Hagen and agent David Siegel.
Neal, you want to give us a minute?
I'm fine.
Come on, Caffrey,
Grab a cup of coffee with me.
She was my girlfriend, all right?
Peter, I appreciate you trying to protect me,
But I can handle this.
I know what you're thinking,
and I want you to stay away from this.
You said it yourself-- she can't know we were there.
If I don't act like everything's normal,
she'll get suspicious.
Okay, but we use it to our advantage.
While you're keeping her occupied,
we'll search her home.
She was so sweet and thoughtful...
so normal.
We were supposed to go shopping next week.
Well, it's safe to say that's canceled.
I kind of feel duped, and I barely know her.
I can only imagine what Neal must be feeling.
I'm just worried whether he can keep up appearances.
Don't you feel bad for him?
I do, but...
he lied to her about who he was too.
You know, hon, you should be a little more understanding.
You know, what I understand is that a life of lies
catches up to you, and it did for Neal.
Hey, find anything?
Oh, a dusty earring behind your dresser,
predating Rebecca, but no bugs.
Cubic zirconia--
could explain the lack of follow-up.
As Oscar Wilde said,
"A woman's face is her work of fiction."
Well, everything about her was fiction, Moz.
If it's any consolation,
I didn't see it coming, and I vetted her.
That worked out well.
She had us all fooled, and that's not easy to do.
The truth is...
I was excited about someone for the first time in a while.
I know you cared about her.
I cared about the person she pretended to be.
If only it were that easy.
It has to be.
We're having lunch tomorrow
while the F.B.I raids her apartment.
If Rebecca killed Hagen, there's a chance--
That she has the blackmail video, yeah.
Rebecca.
This is unexpected.
I couldn't wait until lunch.
Hope you don't mind.
Why would I?
What's the surprise?
For my hero.
Nothing says "thanks for saving my life"
like vanilla bombolini.
You okay?
No, I'm not.
I shouldn't have left you alone yesterday,
after everything you went through.
It's okay. Really, I...
I needed some time alone.
Well, I should have been there.
But no time like the present to make up for it.
What are you doing?
Calling the F.B.I...
To let 'em know I'll be late.
Morning.
Hang on, hang on, hang on.
Neal, talk to me.
Morning, Peter.
What's wrong?
Listen...
I'm gonna be a little late. Rebecca's not feeling well.
I'm gonna make her some chicken soup.
She's there now?
Okay, you caught me.
I ordered it from 2nd Avenue deli.
Are you okay?
Oh, Peter says hi. - Feel better.
Uh, tell him I say hi.
Rebecca says hi.
We'll head to her place now.
I see I've come down with something.
It'll buy us a little time together.
You are an awfully good liar, Mr. Caffrey.
Should I be worried?
No more lies. I promise.
With that in mind,
there's something you should know.
What's that?
Curtis Hagen, the man who kidnapped you--
He's dead.
What happened?
He was shot by a sniper, killed instantly.
That's horrible.
He did kidnap you.
Still, no one deserves that.
Any idea who shot him?
I was hoping you could tell me.
Did you see who was holding you?
They might have been involved.
No.
He only spoke once or twice,
his voice was muffled, he wore a mask.
I'm sorry.
What?
Just admiring you.
It's impressive how well you've handled everything.
Peter, do you want us to scan all the rare-book research?
I mean, she's got drawers of it.
Yeah, photocopy and replace everything.
She has an entire folder on Neal's childhood.
I mean, we don't even have that kind of intel on him.
Make an extra copy.
Yeah.
I know you had to destroy the Codex,
but yesterday you said there was still a way.
What did you mean by that?
I shouldn't have said anything. I...
I can't involve you in it anymore.
Neal, this all leads to the twin of the hope diamond.
We can't stop now. We're so close to finding it.
You were kidnapped because of the Codex.
I can't let that happen again.
This can't be halfway.
We can't be halfway.
If I'm gonna be in your life,
It has to include this part of it.
Well, then maybe it's time I step
away from that part of my life.
What?
Come on, you don't actually think you could do that.
If it came to that...
to us...
Yeah, I could.
I got to say-- it's kind of weird seeing my life
summed up in a file.
And, damn, she is thorough.
Anything you want to admit to before it goes into evidence?
There's nothing illegal about having
three different profiles on OKCupid, all right?
This has gone too far.
What'd you find?
I've got to get my wife out of the city.
正门
I have to go.
What's wrong?
I forgot a doctor's appointment.
I'm sorry.
Wait.
We need to finish talking about this.
Oh, we will. Um, dinner? Tomorrow?
Rebecca--
yeah?
I think I'm falling in love with you.
Neal, I-I-I don't know what to say.
You don't-- you don't have to say anything.
I just-- I needed you to know.
Dinner...
Tomorrow.
Yeah, I'll see you then.
Bye.
You sure you don't want to stay?
I can't.
That one goes on the top file.
How much time do we have?
Not much. She's on her way there now.
I stalled her as long as I could.
Someone tripped the sensor. Meet me back at the office.
Almost done-- ten more minutes.
Make it five.
Be right back.
Where you going?
I saw a Chinese place down the street.
Gonna check out their menu.
外卖菜单
外卖菜单
正门
Good. You're here.
You guys were able to set everything up on time?
Yep, we have full video and audio of her apartment.
Just in time to watch her pack.
You think she's onto us?
No, my menu trick worked.
She hasn't looked for bugs or cameras,
so I don't think she knows we were there.
She's calling someone.
Let it go to voice mail. Jones, turn up the volume.
Peter--
We're gonna hear it eventually.
Hey, Neal, it's me.
Um, look, I've been thinking
a lot about what we talked about earlier,
what you said to me, and, um...
I love you too.
I can't believe I just said that into your voice mail.
I--
I guess I just couldn't wait to tell you.
Okay, I'm gonna hang up before I embarrass myself worse,
But, um, I'll see you tomorrow.
So you told her you loved her?
I had to buy you guys some time.
The question is, what angle is she playing?
That's why she was packing.
You think she's moving on to her next target?
I think you're the only target she cares about.
Yeah, she's packing up everything
from before she became Rebecca.
Because she wants to stay as Rebecca.
Neal, I think she meant what she said.
She's in love with you.
She profiled my exes to
handcraft a persona I would fall for...
building the perfect girlfriend.
I think she built it a little too well--
fell for her own con.
You really think she would have thrown it all away
and settled down with me?
It explains why Hagen turned on her.
He lost control.
And it also explains why she turned on him.
Maybe she got a read on me and decided to play along.
Okay, let's assume you're right.
What reason would she have for telling you she loves you?
Keep me around, help with the diamond.
It's a possibility, and in that case,
she still has no idea we're onto her.
Or I'm right, and she means it,
and we can use it against her.
You know, your relationships
aren't the only ones that are under her microscope.
You have to get Elizabeth out of town.
Already did-
sent her to Bruce's in Washington
until it's settled.
So let's settle it.
What are you thinking?
If she's fallen for you or not, she needs you.
We know that much.
So let's see what she does
when we threaten to take you away.
Thanks for coming in on such short notice.
I, uh--I hope we didn't mess up your day.
There's not much to mess with. I still don't have a job.
Oh, well, I bet you're wondering why you're here.
I'm assuming it has something to do
with the Gershon Museum robbery.
Is there new information?
This isn't about the museum.
Oh. Now I'm wondering why I'm here.
It's about Neal Caffrey.
What about him?
We have reason to believe
that he's been engaged in illegal activities
behind our back for some time now.
What kind of illegal activities?
Does this man look familiar to you?
N-no, who is he?
His name is Curtis Hagen.
Has Neal ever mentioned that name?
I don't believe so. Why?
He was murdered yesterday.
Neal Caffrey is our prime suspect.
You see what she just did?
Pretended not to know Hagen?
Her fake concern
to the news that I'm a murder suspect.
Nah, looked like real concern to me.
It was real, but it wasn't for me.
It's almost impossible not to react
to unpredictable news in some way.
A good con knows how to turn those tells into an advantage.
You play poker?
Ah, I host the occasional Friday night game.
You'll never be invited, no offense.
In poker, it's too obvious to act calm
when you're nervous.
But when you see that fourth ace drop...
The blood pressure spikes.
Yeah.
A good player knows you can't control that,
but you can hide its meaning.
She's hiding her own concern of getting caught
by acting concerned about me.
Or maybe you want her to be lying.
I mean, it would be easier, wouldn't it?
Neal isn't here today, is he?
No, we assigned him to another case across town
so that we have the opportunity
to interview his known acquaintances.
I'm--I'm sorry, this is just a lot to process.
I know Neal. He's not a murderer.
No, no, he wouldn't get his own hands dirty,
but he's not above hiring others.
There's a lot you don't know about Neal Caffrey.
He's told me about his criminal past,
but he says that's all behind him now.
He says that a lot.
Neal had a history with this man.
He also had a strong motive to want him dead.
Which is?
I'm afraid I can't say.
So what am I supposed to do?
If I were you, I'd keep my distance.
I think that went well.
She should consider a second career on Broadway.
Yeah, so should you, Peter.
I think I sold a complete distrust of Neal pretty well.
All right, we showed our hand.
There's no way she's sticking around
after the FBI calls her in about a murder she committed.
She's gonna run.
Unless she has a reason to stay.
It's her. Madison Square Park, one hour.
I'll assemble the team.
All agents maintain position until my word.
Rebecca's in the park now, sending Caffrey.
Hey. I got here as fast as I could.
You okay?
Walk with me.
How's the audio?
Five by five.
As long as Neal keeps the pen pointed in the right direction.
Rebecca, what's going on? You're starting to worry me.
I was called into the FBI this morning.
What?
They were asking about Hagen.
Neal, I had to warn you.
They think you hired someone to kill him.
Me? That's insane. That...
I didn't do it. You have to believe me.
What are you gonna do?
I have to run.
He's good.
Two can play at that game.
Run? Neal, there has to be another way.
The feds could have followed you here, all right?
They didn't. I made sure of it.
You wouldn't know it if they...
Trust me, I would.
I can't trust anyone right now.
Look, I hate to say it, but this is good-bye.
I can go with you.
Living on the run isn't a life for someone like you.
You're not that kind of girl.
Maybe I'm not the girl you think I am.
Neal, there's something that I have to tell you...
About who I really am.
Something's wrong.
Let's see if Caffrey can save it.
That's what all this is about, isn't it?
I have to hand it to you -- almost worked.
What are you talking about?
Letting me make the decision to come clean to you --
That was very clever.
Rebecca, you're not making any sense right now. What --
I didn't see the feds earlier. I must be slipping.
If there are feds here, they're here for me.
They think I'm the one who killed Hagen, come on.
There's no more point in lying, Neal.
We've been made. We got to grab her.
But we don't have anything on her.
If we don't go, she's gonna run.
You're right.
On my signal.
Let's start telling the truth.
Did you kill Siegel?
Where's my diamond?
Tell me if you killed Siegel, I'll give you the location.
We're done playing games, Neal.
I was gonna give everything up for you.
I don't know what I was thinking.
Jones, cut her off. Move in now. Move in.
Come here!
Go! Go! I got him.
All agents head towards north exit!
Suspect headed west on Fifth!
All units, subject heading south
on Fifth Avenue in taxi number 86Z5.
We've coordinated with NYPD and state police.
All eyes are on train stations, buses, airports.
There is no way she's leaving this island.
We need to go back to her apartment.
We made copies of everything there.
But we only had time for a quick search.
We looked in the bag she dropped.
Nothing in it but a burner phone and some cash.
Where are we on the cab?
We got the license number,
but it was already found. Ditched on 13th and Broadway.
Check all traffic cams and surveillance within a half mile.
Already on it.
Now that our cover is blown,
let's tear her apartment apart.
Maybe we can find something that tells us
who we're dealing with.
Excellent.
Pull up all the floorboards
and check for any hollow spots on the ceiling.
Make sure you take the back off,
check between the cardboard backing and the picture.
Talked to the landlord.
Said she was a loner -- never had anyone over.
Any references?
He didn't bother to check.
She paid six months cash up front.
Six months.
She even knew how long it would take.
You think I deserve this, don't you?
No one deserves this.
I always prided myself
on being one step ahead of everyone.
Always the con man, never the con.
Look how far it's gotten me.
Maybe there's a lesson to be learned in that.
Shot fired! Everybody down!
Peter?
Yeah?
We scoured the area-- so far, no sign of her,
but we've got units canvassing the neighborhood.
What about where the shot came from?
It looks like a rooftop from across the way.
She didn't leave anything behind.
How is he?
He's all right. Keep looking.
Well?
I'm fine.
This is unnecessary.
Just sit still.
She ruined my jacket.
Yeah, and we're gonna make her pay for that,
But you're going home.
I told you, I'm fine.
She shot you.
She shot at me.
She hit Hagen square in the heart.
She doesn't miss.
If she wanted to kill me, I'd be dead.
Fine. It was a warning shot,
and I'm taking the warning.
Why take the shot in that moment?
Maybe you looked especially smug.
Or maybe we were close to something
she didn't want us to find.
You had just finished searching this area.
About to turn...
The radiator isn't an ideal place to hide something.
Once the winter comes, everything inside it would be destroyed.
But she only paid for six months.
She wasn't planning on seeing the winter.
There's a seam here.
It's her go-bag.
With this, she could go anywhere.
Without it, she's stuck.
We've got her trapped.
Jones is running every alias we have on her through the system.
I'm hopeful something will ping,
give us some clues to who she is.
You don't seem very optimistic.
We still can't prove she took a shot at you,
and we didn't get a confession at the park.
The most we can get on her is stalking
and possession of fake I.D.s.
We need more proof
than Siegel's cooper 3 connection.
That's true.
He was standing outside her building.
then he walked to his car,
where she got a jump on him.
Yeah, she tossed Siegel's gun and badge in the trash,
but she wouldn't be so careless with her own gun.
What's the best way to get rid of it?
Drop the gun in the river.
But it'd take 30 minutes to get there by foot.
That's too far to carry a weapon
that could get her life behind bars.
Mm, she wouldn't have hailed a cab--too close to the scene.
On the video, she was headed north.
Towards her home.
Did you find any equipment that could have melted the gun down?
Unless you count her hot plate, no.
All right.
So either she ditched the gun in the sewer grate
and kept moving...
We checked all of them.
Or she went home, waited for the heat to die down,
then disposed of it.
Eh, it could be anywhere.
What?
It was raining the day Siegel died, right?
Right.
What?
What if she hid it somewhere where it would never be found?
This is dappled.
The day this was set, it was raining.
She could've tossed the gun in here, smoothed it over,
and no one would ever know.
Construction should have been done months ago.
I never would have thought of it.
Thank god for bureaucracy.
X-rays showed something metal,
but with all that rebar in there,
it's hard to tell what it is.
Let's hope you're right.
Otherwise, the City's gonna be pretty pissed at you.
The ballistics were a match,
and we found a fingerprint on one of the bullets inside.
It matched Rebecca's.
Now we just have to find her.
Well, we're one step closer. One of her passports pinged.
With who?
MI5. I sent you the file.
MI5 is serious business. How'd she get on their radar?
She was one of their agents.
Her real name is Rachel Turner.
Her father was American colonel in the U.S. Army.
Her mother was British.
She moved around her whole life,
constantly uprooted, starting over,
never learned to form attachments,
but got very good at faking them.
She was a perfect shot,
great at developing underground contacts.
Turns out she used those contacts
to sell confidential information.
That's when she went underground.
Every time they get close to her,
she reinvents herself and disappears.
Not this time.
You were right.
I'm not sure about what, but I like to hear that.
Rebecca fell in love with me.
Yeah.
It should be comforting.
It means what we had was somehow still real.
But it's not.
I wanted it to be.
And she's a murderer.
You didn't know who she really was.
If I'm the only thing she's staying for,
let's use it.
No. I'm not using you as bait.
You already did.
When she didn't know the truth.
Now she does, and need I remind you, she shot at you.
I'm still here.
Let's keep it that way.
Go home, Neal.
I'll call you if I hear anything.
Hey, this is Rebecca.
Sorry I missed your call.
Leave a message.
I know you have Hagen's blackmail on me,
and I have something you want--
The location of the diamond.
Let's talk.
This is ridiculous.
Indian food is traditionally enjoyed on the floor.
I'm not gonna hide in my own home.
You have an ex with a sniper rifle, Neal.
Bare minimum--we have to stay low and avoid windows,
Which is no easy task with this open-concept design.
I offered her a trade--
The location of the diamond
in exchange for Hagen's blackmail video.
We don't have the location, neal.
What we have is a nearly indecipherable equation
locked up in the steel trap of my mind.
But she doesn't know that.
Hand me the gobi. I'm stress-eating.
It was the only way to draw her out.
So best-case scenario--
You meet with her, she brings the video.
The Feds show up, arrest her, and find the video.
All the blackmail Hagen has on me is exposed,
and I go back to jail.
That's the best-case scenario.
Worst-case--she discovers I don't know the location,
realizes I'm trying to pull one over on her...
And I find myself reciting Proust over your grave.
Looks like I need to find a third scenario.
Yeah.
Should I be brushing up on my Proust?
No F.B.I outside?
You know I don't want the bureau
to get ahold of that video.
Regardless, as long as you're on that anklet,
I'd rather not linger.
Where's my diamond?
Location's in here.
Your turn.
Giving up millions and millions of dollars
for this one little video.
You must really want it.
Looks like we both got what we wanted.
Come with me. Let's get the diamond together.
Why would I do that?
Because you want to be with me,
and you know I want the same thing.
I know you want that diamond.
It stopped being just about the diamond a long time ago.
We can have everything we want.
There's nothing in our way anymore.
Except that I can't possibly believe you.
Take it.
I don't care anymore.
Just come with me.
The F.B.I is on the way.
You called the feds?
You killed my new handler.
Don't make me do this, Neal.
Too late.
It's over.
You're an idiot.
We could have had everything.
It wouldn't have been real.
You're a con man.
You could have convinced yourself,
but instead, you choose to stay shackled.
And yet, still freer than you. -
You're always running from one identity to the next
because you can't face the truth.
What's that?
That you hate who you really are.
And I can see why.
You know me so well,
You know I never turn up without a way out.
Actually, there are three ways out--
through the south window or one of two doors.
You've always underestimated me.
There's a fourth way.
Hold it right there!
F.B.I! Stop right there! Stop right there!
Put your weapon on the ground!
Now!
Oh, look...
Somebody already beat me to it.
Now you know why I didn't mention the fourth way.
Rachel Turner, you are under arrest for murder.
I gave you strict instructions not to bait her.
It worked, didn't it?
How'd you know she wasn't gonna shoot you?
Rachel Turner has been officially charged
with the murder of Agent David Siegel.
I guess that's what they call closure.
Look at it this way--
The next lucky woman who comes along
is gonna seem like a million bucks.
Either that, or every relationship after this
is gonna seem really boring.
Well, there's a lot of room between really boring
and someone taking a shot at you.
It takes a damn good agent to help solve his own murder.
Something else I should tell you.
I'm not sure I'm up for another surprise right now.
I don't think this will come as a huge shock to you.
You're going to Washington.
They want me as a section chief in D.C.
Well, it's been a long time coming.
You deserve it.
Uh, the job starts in two weeks.
Two weeks? Wow.
Yeah.
Hard to imagine not working here anymore.
Yeah. Poor Jones. What's he gonna do?
Well, I'm hopeful that he will keep you out of trouble.
In light of recent events,
I'm not sure that's the best idea.
You helped bring in Siegel's killer.
That's the only thing you should feel responsible for.
If anyone sees it differently, they should come talk to me.
She got what she deserved. You, my friend, did not.
Not yet...
But the game's not over.
You want to go after the diamond?
Well, look on the bright side.
Now we don't have to split it three ways.
Are you sure you're ready?
There's no reason to wait.
Peter's on his way to D.C. Rebecca's behind bars.
Wow. It took me longer
to get over my favorite barista moving to Brooklyn.
I'm guessing millions of dollars in treasure
would have helped speed up your recovery.
Considerably.
So we have an equation to solve.
Moz?
I must summon the equation from the depths of my mind.
I require total silence and a sprig of rosemary.
Rosemary?
It stimulates the brain.
Well, I don't have any rosemary.
Then total silence will do.
I really appreciate the opportunity, Bruce.
Yeah, you bet. Oh, I can't wait to get started.
Bruce, I have to run. El just got home.
I appreciate you keeping an eye on her.
Thanks, bye.
So good to be home.
Good to have you home.
Really good.
How's Neal doing?
Pretty shook up.
Did he learn something from it?
Well, I'm afraid to say it, hon, but maybe.
Well, for the better?
We'll see.
Are we celebrating?
Siegel's case is closed.
Rebecca is behind bars,
and the Burkes are going to Washington.
Is it official?
It is. I just spoke to Bruce.
I'm so proud of you.
Well, this is actually perfect timing,
'cause, um, I have some news of my own.
When we first started talking about Washington,
I reached out to the National Gallery.
They just called me and offered me a position.
What? Fantastic.
I can't believe you didn't tell me.
Well, I didn't want to get my hopes up.
You know, I thought it was a long shot.
To us...
and to our new life.
We're really doing this, aren't we?
Yeah, I think we are.
You okay?
Yeah, it's just, uh--
it's finally hitting me, you know.
we're gonna be packing up this whole house
and walking out that front door.
Yeah.
It's gonna be tough to leave.
Yeah.
But then again, there will be a new door we can go through...
at the National Gallery.
And the F.B.I headquarters.
To new doors.

Yes.
I'm impressed, Neal. That was well played.
What's the threat? You kept a backup of the video?
No, I didn't.
There's no threat, just a promise.
I'll see you soon.
