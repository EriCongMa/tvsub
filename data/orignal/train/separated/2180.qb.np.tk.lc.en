&quot; aloha oe &quot;
so , uh , we have , uh ,
been together for , um , three years .
four .
see , this is , uh , specifically what i am talking about .
i &apos;m just correcting you .
okay . uh , four years .
it was three years , 11 months , two days-- exactly .
you done ?
detective williams asked you a question .
when ?
he asked if you were going to allow him to finish his thought .
i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m ... whose side are you on ?
i don &apos;t take sides , commander .
i &apos;m an objective observer .
as you know , the governor asked me to oversee
the annual psychological audit of personnel ,
and i was concerned by what detective williams had to say .
thank you .
okay . yeah , fine .
so , we , uh , we don &apos;t ... we don &apos;t agree on a few things ,
but i don &apos;t see why that &apos;s such a big deal . um , i &apos;m gonna ...
i &apos;m gonna go ahead and stop . &quot; a few things . &quot;
a few things ? we don &apos;t agree on anything .
okay , name one .
okay . um , i never get to drive my own automobile .
and i don &apos;t understand why you &apos;re angry about that .
i mean , i &apos;d think you &apos;d be grateful
for being driven around .
he gets driven around all day , every day .
who am i ? miss daisy ?
sometimes i like to drive my own car .
sometimes you do drive .
sometimes ? are you saying that with a straight face
in front of this woman ?
i ... do i ...
do you never drive your own car ?
i don &apos;t always drive your car .
no .
i get to drive my own car when you &apos;re not in it .
when i &apos;m alone , i get to drive my own car . yeah .
that &apos;s sometimes .
okay , you know what ? okay , fine .
you want to know why you spend
so much time in the passenger seat ?
do you want to know ?
this should be fanta ...
yes , of course i want to know . i get carsick if i don &apos;t drive .
and he laughs . and he laughs-- first time i &apos;ve told him that .
&apos;cause it &apos;s ridiculous .
&apos;cause it &apos;s ridiculous , okay ?
he &apos;s a control freak .
he &apos;s a gigantic control freak .
it has nothing to do with motion , trust me , please .
well , detective williams .
yeah .
commander mcgarrett is sharing something
very personal with you .
perhaps you could show him a little respect .
but he &apos;s lying .
i &apos;m not lying .
he &apos;s a navy seal .
so what ? what does that got to do with it ?
okay , okay .
what does that got to do with it ?
please stop .
i don &apos;t really want to be here , respectfully .
i &apos;m sure he doesn &apos;t either .
but if you &apos;re not gonna be honest ,
i &apos;m gonna leave .
i &apos;m being honest .
gentlemen .
yes .
this is a mandated review .
so let &apos;s continue , shall we ?
fine with me . yeah .
it &apos;s good .
why don &apos;t we shift gears a bit .
all right .
describe how you two first met .
hands up ! don &apos;t move !
who are you ?
who are you ? i am detective danny williams .
lieutenant commander steve mcgarrett .
this my father &apos;s house .
put your weapon down right now .
no , you put your weapon down
and show me your i.d. !
you show me your i.d. , right now !
i &apos;m not putting my gun down .
neither am i.
four years ago ...
governor jameson asked me
to start a , uh , major crimes task force .
and danno ...
i &apos;m gonna stop ...
you see , he knows that i don &apos;t like that .
you &apos;re right . excuse me , sir daniel .
th @-@ this ... is going right off the rails ...
okay , okay . come on , come on . i &apos;m teasing , all right ?
right after i started the task force ,
detective danny williams was my first hire .
you got no choice , detective .
governor gave me jurisdiction on making you my partner .
we &apos;re gonna get along great .
right . i personally wouldn &apos;t call it ,
um , a &quot; hire . &quot;
it was more like a kidnapping .
a ransom . it &apos;s the kind of thing , i didn &apos;t have a choice .
i liked his sense of humor .
you know , his personality .
you &apos;re right . i don &apos;t like you .
when you &apos;re getting shot at ,
it is nice to reflect on what a nut job this guy is .
tell me about the others .
well , after danny signed on ,
we recruited chin ho kelly .
i can &apos;t be a cop anymore .
i &apos;m the last person the department wants
to see wearing a badge .
he was fired from the hpd at the time .
that &apos;s right , but we straightened that out .
yeah , and then , uh , kono kalakaua--
that &apos;s chin &apos;s cousin-- she was next .
i &apos;m told she wasn &apos;t even a police officer at the time .
so your cousin tells us
you &apos;re graduating from the police academy next week .
how &apos;d you like to earn a little extra credit before you do ?
yeah , she was a few weeks away
from graduating from the academy .
but , uh , we needed a female , you see ? and she fit the bill .
and just recently , we recruited a former hpd swat commander
named lou grover , from chicago .
we want you to join five @-@ o.
so five people make up the five @-@ o task force ?
yeah , but we &apos;re , uh ... we &apos;re more than a task force , you see .
w @-@ we &apos;re &apos; ohana .
why the look , detective williams ?
oh , no , n @-@ no look .
um , i guess i was just , uh , agreeing with him ...
for the first time .
i think we &apos;re good .
you &apos;re doing great , honey . keep going .
keep going .
i can &apos;t .
come on , just a few more steps .
the view ... it &apos;s fantastic .
hey , now .
you haven &apos;t turned around once .
well , what can i say ? i &apos;ve got the best scenery right here .
well , this &quot; scenery &quot; is gonna need an afternoon
at the spa after this .
deal . now hustle ; we &apos;re almost there .
trust me , you &apos;re gonna love what you see .
race ya ?
you &apos;re on .
what is that ?
aren &apos;t you gonna rinse off ?
i &apos;d rather watch you .
get over here .
you take such good care of me .
have you thought any more about what we talked about ?
ugh , i &apos;m sorry .
hey , it &apos;s okay .
you got to take it , right ?
yeah .
hello ?
yeah . yeah , i got it .
i &apos;m on my way .
adam ...
don &apos;t ever apologize for doing your job , okay ?
go . i &apos;ll take the boards home .
okay .
all right .
i &apos;ll see you later .
i &apos;m heading to a crime scene .
diamond head trail .
in case you lose me .
what do we got , lou ?
two dead .
name of todd sands and tracy powell .
both schoolteachers on the mainland .
i found this on the male vic .
apparently , he was looking for a romantic spot
to pop the question .
any witnesses ?
just the birds .
these are 7.62 rounds .
this is military issue .
mahalo , commander mcgarrett .
you saved me a trip to ballistics .
you &apos;re welcome , max . what do we got on the victims ?
they appear to have been shot in close proximity .
how close ?
dr. shaw , care to opine ?
well , based on several identifiers ,
including multiple through @-@ and @-@ throughs ,
i &apos;d estimate ten to 15 feet ,
with a trajectory of approximately 45 degrees .
all right , who &apos;s your friend , max ?
this is dr. shaw .
she &apos;s a recent graduate of johns hopkins university .
i will be mentoring her in the medical arts .
oh . well , lucky you .
you must be detective williams .
yeah .
i have given her the full heads up .
you gave her the heads up on what ?
it &apos;s all true .
i &apos;m steve mcgarrett .
welcome aboard , dr. shaw .
nice to be aboard .
okay , i don &apos;t get it .
so , if they were attacked at close range ,
what are we looking at here ?
very fit mugger with a serious automatic weapon ?
well , that would be a sound theory ,
except for i found both wallets ,
rental car keys and jewelry in their backpacks .
maybe it was personal .
perp knew they were climbing , was waiting for them at the top .
what do you got there , danny ?
think we found our shooter .
you ever see anything like that before ?
it &apos;s a ucav .
a combat drone .
so what are you saying ?
a machine did this ?
not on its own .
someone , somewhere , pulled the trigger .
what are you guys doing here ?
you first .
i &apos;m on surveillance . how &apos;d you find me ?
your mother &apos;s car has an anti @-@ theft device .
technology &apos;s not my friend .
get in before you blow my cover .
no , no . wait .
i got it .
that &apos;s very 1988 .
okay , jerry , i know i &apos;m gonna regret asking this ,
but what is it that you are surveilling ?
what you two should be keeping an eye on .
ah , good point .
girls in spandex .
next door over .
vintage books .
what about it ?
two weeks ago , the owner came back
from a trip to dusseldorf ,
where he purchased the entire inventory
of a library that was closing down .
get out of here .
well , let &apos;s go arrest this guy .
what are we doing ?
not so fast , mcgruff .
he hasn &apos;t committed a crime yet ,
but he &apos;s gonna-- trust me .
okay , how do you know that ?
that library in dusseldorf was ancient .
and the books inside it were period .
the paper in those books--
75 % cotton , 25 % ultrafine linen .
you know what that means ?
i do . it makes for good counterfeiting stock .
you , sir , are going to the head of the class .
just &apos; cause he bought the books ,
it doesn &apos;t mean he &apos;s gonna recycle the paper
and start printing bills ,
all right ?
what else is he gonna do with them ?
i don &apos;t know , maybe the vintage bookshop owner
is @-@ is gonna sell them .
no one reads hard @-@ copy books anymore-- even i know that .
jerry , you might be onto something here , okay ?
but you can &apos;t be doing this .
you &apos;re a civilian .
i &apos;m a seeker of truth .
you are also a , uh , conspiracy theorist ,
who still lives with his mother
and has yet to file a tax return .
listen to me ,
call the hpd , they can handle this .
i did call the hpd .
they treated me like i was some sort of nut job .
that &apos;s ... shocking .
jerry , i &apos;ll help you dig into this ,
i promise , all right ?
but right now , we need your help . take a look at this .
whoa , not here .
we &apos;re too exposed .
what is that ?
where was this taken ?
here , on oahu .
this thing was used in an attack this morning .
left two people dead .
i &apos;ve seen drones before ,
but i &apos;ve never seen anything like that .
i reached out to my military contacts ,
but they wouldn &apos;t disclose much information
due to operational security .
so i figured maybe you could help .
okay , i &apos;m pretty sure what we &apos;re looking at
is a prototype domestic surveillance drone .
minus the evil aftermarket weaponized payload , of course .
the government has been denying use of domestic drones
for a very long time , all right ?
that &apos;s why you hit a brick wall with the military .
think they &apos;re gonna admit to violating your right to privacy ?
better chance of getting a backstage pass at area 51 .
okay , what about a manufacturer ? any ideas ?
i seem to recall some chatter about a drone
coming out of a super @-@ secret advanced development program
a branch of a local military contractor named venpax systems .
it could be your manufacturer .
obviously , you didn &apos;t get that from me .
obviously .
i &apos;d like to help you guys out ,
but the truth is i can neither confirm nor deny
that this particular uav belongs to us .
you can &apos;t ?
no .
okay , well , maybe you can , uh , &quot; confirm or deny &quot;
that these people are dead .
did you know them ?
no .
todd sands and tracy powell--
they were here on vacation .
they got here on monday , they went to a luau ,
and they did a tour of waimea falls park .
and now they &apos;re dead , and i want to know why .
look , you have to understand that
this project is a matter of national security ,
so i can &apos;t just answer your questions
without compromising what we &apos;re doing here .
and you have to understand ,
if you don &apos;t answer our questions ,
the only thing you &apos;re gonna be compromising is your freedom .
commander , we &apos;re under contract by the military .
that means that we operate under their level of security .
so threatening me isn &apos;t gonna work .
book him , danno .
did you hear what i just said ?
yeah , loud and clear .
put your hands behind your back .
you &apos;re under arrest for obstruction , withholding information ,
and impeding a murder investigation .
none of that &apos;s gonna stick , and you know it .
true .
but how many more government contracts
do you think you &apos;re gonna get
after a background check shows an arrest on your record ?
let &apos;s go .
okay .
okay .
all right , this is qv @-@ 901 .
it &apos;s a surveillance drone with no other payload ,
which means it flies unarmed .
three weeks ago , while it was on a routine test flight ,
it was hijacked , never recovered .
how do you hijack a drone ?
gps spoofing .
somebody jammed venpax &apos;s control signal to the uav ,
fed it false gps data ,
and made it land wherever the hijacker wanted it .
okay , so what are we looking at here ?
inside job ?
security breach ?
we don &apos;t know yet .
uh , venpax gave us a list
of all their current and ex @-@ employees
that had clearance on the project ,
so we should run their names against the victims ,
see if we come up with a connection .
right , and if we find one , that might explain motive .
i &apos;ll tell you something , takes a special kind of brilliance
to hijack a drone , arm it and reprogram it .
we are dealing with one very smart ,
very sick son of a bitch .
same drone that attacked our hikers this morning .
witnesses say that it flew in ,
hovered , gathering a crowd , and then bang , opens fire .
ten seconds later , we got five dead , 19 wounded .
chin ho and kono are running i.d. &apos; s right now
to see if they can make any connection
between the victims of both attacks .
one of my guys got a few shots off at the drone ,
trying to bring it down .
bystander caught it on video .
that &apos;s good shooting .
if he had missed , more people would &apos;ve been dead .
we can &apos;t find any correlation between
the kuhio beach and the diamond head victims .
which means the targets could be random .
all right , we need to start looking at this
as an act of terrorism .
except for the fact that no group or individual
has claimed responsibility .
well , maybe they &apos;re not done yet .
oh , good . i &apos;m glad you &apos;re all here .
i got some more intel on that drone you &apos;re looking for .
but first , a disclaimer .
whatever i share with you today
is in no way connected to me , my family or anyone i know .
i &apos;m strictly here on a tour of the palace , nothing more .
any attempt to associate me
with the information i &apos;m about to share
will be vehemently denied by myself
and the attorney i will retain .
are we understood ?
d @-@ do we ... should we sign something , everybody ?
or just , &quot; get on with it , &quot;
will that suffice , jerry ?
you &apos;re so naive about how this world really works .
jerry , we get it . get on with it . what do you got ?
as far as drones go , they may be state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art ,
but the technology is still incredibly immature .
they are severely limited
by a whole heap of engineering issues ,
such as an unprotected frequency band .
there &apos;s just not enough spectrum to go around .
okay .
what does that mean in the language the rest of us speak ?
it means that you can buy all the equipment you need
to hijack a drone at your local hardware store .
you can ?
oh , good . well , then , um ...
go ahead . that should cover it . go ahead .
okay , not so fast , donald trump .
i can jack this thing from your shooter .
only problem is , got to be within 200 yards from the drone
to tap into the frequency .
okay , so what you &apos;re saying is
there &apos;s nothing we can do until it attacks again .
correction : we have to be there when it attacks again .
sarge , some guy just called
claiming he &apos;s responsible for the drone attacks .
how do we know it &apos;s real ?
he knew details we haven &apos;t released to the public .
said he &apos;s gonna call back
in ten minutes and wants to speak to someone in charge .
patch him through to mcgarrett .
chin , run a trace .
we &apos;re on it .
almost there .
come on , chin .
come on , come on , chin . come on , come on .
almost there , almost there . almost there , almost there .
all right , go .
this is steve mcgarrett . who am i talking to ?
you &apos;re going to have to do much better than that , steve .
oh , you think this is funny ? seven people are dead ,
and there &apos;s a lot more in the hospital .
on the contrary , i think it &apos;s a tragedy .
but it &apos;s nothing compared to the hundreds
killed by your drone attacks
in the middle east .
you &apos;re comparing sworn enemies of the united states to innocent civilians .
there were plenty of innocents killed in those attacks , too ,
commander mcgarrett .
you of all people should know that .
so that &apos;s what this is about for you ?
revenge ? is that right ?
justice .
justice ?
you want our government to apologize for keeping us safe ?
no . we are way past apologies .
america needs to be reminded what it &apos;s like to be terrorized .
to be afraid to step outside .
so you &apos;re saying this isn &apos;t over ?
not by a long shot .
okay , hold on .
just hold on a second . wait .
expect more blood in two hours .
tell me you got that .
no . he must have bounced that call off
追踪失败
a dozen different relay stations and satellites .
lou , call the hpd .
tell them the island is under siege .
we need to get everybody off the streets right now .
the governor is asking everyone to remain indoors , away from windows
and do not venture outside until further notice .
now let &apos;s go through what we know right now .
a weaponized drone opened attack in waikiki ...
let &apos;s go , let &apos;s go , everyone !
let &apos;s go ! we got to get indoors !
keep your keikis close !
everyone get indoors !
let &apos;s go , let &apos;s go , everyone !
keep your keikis close !
danno , what &apos;s going on ?
doesn &apos;t matter what &apos;s going on , all right ?
go inside , listen to your coaches , do as they say ,
and i will call you as soon as i can , all right ?
all right , i love you .
love you , too .
off the beach . we need everyone off the beach right now .
we need everyone inside .
guys , check this out .
i broke down the drone pilot &apos;s call with a wave modulator
and i unscrambled his voice .
america needs to be reminded what it &apos;s like to be terrorized .
to be afraid to step outside .
our mystery voice belongs to a
jonathan redmond , an ex @-@ venpax employee .
乔纳森 · 雷德蒙
he was fired three years ago for stealing company hardware .
venpax had his voice print on file
after redmond made numerous harassing phone calls .
all right , did venpax ever press charges ?
no , they were worried that the company secrets would get out during a trial .
yeah , well , no wonder they didn &apos;t mention redmond to us .
a cancer like that could kill a billion @-@ dollar contract .
but , lucky for us , redmond continued his thieving ways
and was arrested by hpd two years ago
for several burglaries .
he served 18 months , then was paroled a few weeks ago .
all right , where do we find this punk ?
clear .
clear .
clear .
maybe he &apos;s operating it from a remote location .
danny , call chin , have him run background
on redmond &apos;s family , friends ,
anybody who might know where he is .
kono .
hey . you find redmond ?
no , he &apos;s keeping a low profile .
okay . well , i ran his financials .
i found four wire transfers , totaling $ 500,000,
deposited to an offshore account .
who sent the money ?
i traced it back to a textile company here in town .
the cia thinks it &apos;s a front for the srs .
srs is an international terrorist group
made of the best former soviet union intelligence agents .
redmond told us he &apos;s on a rampage for revenge
and ideological reasons , but this half @-@ a @-@ million bucks
makes me think that &apos;s just to throw us off .
maybe this is really about money .
all right , so if these srs guys
are paying redmond to terrorize the island ,
the question is : why ?
i mean , it makes no sense , right ?
i mean , if they wanted to hit us bad ,
they &apos;d have far more impact on the mainland .
guys , i don &apos;t think we &apos;re looking at the whole picture .
i think it &apos;s about something bigger .
i dug a little deeper , and i found more wire transfers
to a systems analyst named lawrence turner .
up until a month ago ,
turner was working for a local military contractor .
the cia discovered he &apos;d been using his security clearance
to download thousands of classified documents .
and he started selling them , piece by piece .
let me guess-- they were bought , paid for
by the same textile company that slid redmond the 500 racks .
exactly .
where &apos;s turner now ?
well , that &apos;s what the cia wants to know .
when they went to arrest him last month ,
he disappeared .
cia thinks that turner &apos;s still on the island .
they have their eyes on the ports and the airstrips .
and they &apos;ve been monitoring the chatter
ever since he fell off the radar .
they think he &apos;s never left .
whoa , sarah connor , i come in peace .
jerry , what the hell is that ?
it &apos;s how we &apos;re gonna stop our shooter .
oh ! easy , boy .
check it out-- this thing creates an electromagnetic field
which will disrupt our pilot &apos;s signal .
all you got to do is get me close enough to the drone ,
and this puppy will do the rest .
oh , that &apos;s all .
okay . well , how we gonna do that ?
we give our shooter a little bait .
bait ?
like , uh ...
oh , we &apos;re the , uh ... the bait ?
where are you guys ?
kalakaua and saratoga .
all right , just keep circling the block .
if our guy bites , we &apos;re two minutes away .
so stupid . this is so stupid .
okay ? it &apos;s stupid .
what ?
what , what ? i &apos;m chum , okay ?
my life has been reduced to a piece of chum .
thank you .
it &apos;s a solid plan .
it &apos;s a solid plan ?
now it &apos;s ... it &apos;s a solid plan hatched by a guy
who believes that aliens are living amongst us .
you got a better plan ? i &apos;d like to hear it .
what , like , right this second ?
no , next week . after we &apos;ve enjoyed
the traffic @-@ free roads
and the no wait for a table at blt next week .
hey , hey ! i don &apos;t need the sarcasm , okay ?
i &apos;m already risking my life . i don &apos;t need the added sarcasm .
okay , you don &apos;t like it , you can get out and walk .
how about that ?
what is this , high school ?
no , look .
sir .
sir .
wake up . get up . wake up .
we got to get you inside , okay ?
you got to get indoors , all right ? go .
steve !
get down ! get down !
we &apos;re taking fire on koa and ocean !
hang on .
steve , you all right ?
take cover . go . take cover .
come on , get up , come on . that thing &apos;s coming back .
we got to get out of here . come on .
i can &apos;t drive , danny .
oh , really ? there &apos;s a silver lining in the face of death .
fantastic .
my leg will heal . don &apos;t get used to it .
come on . let &apos;s go .
faster , danny . come on .
it &apos;s going fa ... this is as fast as it goes .
you know this . you &apos;re not even redlining , okay ?
look , shut up , okay ? i don &apos;t know what &apos;s worse ,
your driving or your backseat driving . zip it .
kono , go ahead . we &apos;re a little busy .
guys , air traffic control
is reporting a small aircraft on approach .
no , no , no , no , no . i thought we shut down the airport .
we did . but this thing isn &apos;t landing at the airport .
it &apos;s headed for town .
wait a minute . we got this all wrong .
this is a ... this is an aircraft extraction .
the drone attack was just a diversion .
right , they paid redmond to clear the streets
so they can land a plane and pick up lawrence turner .
if he gets on that plane ,
he &apos;ll compromise national security .
steve .
i see it .
lou , where are you ?
right behind you !
all right , come on , jerry .
it &apos;s your turn .
this thing is gonna work , isn &apos;t it ?
theoretically ...
no , no . wrong answer , jerry . wrong answer .
okay , okay . it &apos;s gonna work ... i think .
i got a lock on its signal !
she &apos;s mine .
you got it .
all right !
one nasty killing machine down for the count !
nice one .
go , go ! stop that plane . i got this .
jerry , check the transmission log .
it &apos;ll tell us where the pilot &apos;s operating from .
copy , copy .
one will suffice .
copy .
okay , got it .
the operator &apos;s gps coordinates are
north two @-@ one , dot , 288824,
west 157 dot 852056 ...
steve , the plane &apos;s starting to move .
it &apos;s taking off !
no way we &apos;re gonna stop that now .
relax , partners .
i got this .
jerry , what are you doing ?
feeling the force .
just like skywalker on the trench run .
hang on .
son of a bitch .
he really did it .
we got movement !
i got turner !
on your knees !
get your hands on your head !
seven people are dead , even more injured .
for what ? a payday ?
isn &apos;t that why we get up in the morning ?
that &apos;s what i get up for .
and this .
turner !
it &apos;s over .
lawrence turner ...
... you &apos;re under arrest for espionage .
you know , you ought to look into
whether they got some kind of a loyalty program .
like , they &apos;ll give you a card ,
and every fifth bullet extraction is free .
well , i &apos;m certain such a program doesn &apos;t exist , captain .
i believe he was joking , max .
ah . i can see how that was an attempt at humor .
oh , keep it up , wise guy .
you might see an attempt at murder .
lou , he wasn &apos;t being rude .
he &apos;s @-@ he &apos;s just max , and you &apos;ll learn that .
you know , that reminds me , max . it &apos;s been killing me all day .
what did you tell your new protégé about me ?
i beg your pardon ?
well , you said you gave her a heads up .
heads up about what ? what did you say ?
oh , yes . i just explained to dr. shaw
that commander mcgarrett is the leader of five @-@ 0,
and that you &apos;re his
deeply cynical , misanthropic , short @-@ tempered partner .
what ?
you know , i think i see what you mean about him .
now , dr. shaw agreed with my assessment .
however , she did think you were cute .
really ?
uh @-@ huh . well , she got a point ,
right ? i can live with that .
what ?
brother , i thought you were shot .
i was . in my thigh .
thigh ? that don &apos;t count .
for you ? no , for you , it would not .
thought you was down for the count .
i brought you some garlic shrimp and some balloons .

i thought your car was shot up .

you can help me out with my surveillance .
wow . that &apos;s , uh ... that &apos;s tempting , jerry .
but you know what ? i think i &apos;d like to go home .
i &apos;ve had enough excitement for one day .
okay ?
no , i got it .
now ... where were we ?
adam , there is nothing i &apos;d like more than to be your wife .
so what &apos;s stopping you ?
it &apos;s just everything that we &apos;ve been through .
i just want to know that we &apos;re gonna be safe .
i can &apos;t go through that again .
thinking i &apos;m gonna lose you .
hey , you &apos;re not gonna lose me .
i promise .
you promise ?
i promise .
when i heard you were coming to see me , i asked myself why .
and then i realized ,
it &apos;s the two @-@ year anniversary of my sister &apos;s murder ,
which means you must be here to apologize
for letting it happen .
you remember the $ 25 million in an offshore account
you tried to bribe me with ?
internal affairs has been watching me ever since you were arrested .
they think i have that money .
it &apos;s not my problem .
i want you to sign an affidavit saying that
the money never changed hands .
why would i do that ?
because maybe for once in your miserable life ,
you &apos;ll want to do something decent .
let me think about it .
i &apos;ll get back to you .
thank you , sir .
who is he ?
that &apos;s what we have to find out .
because if he knows ,
we &apos;re gonna have to deal with that .
grace ?
grace ?
i believe grace isn &apos;t due back from school for another half hour .
whoa , whoa , whoa . stop .
what are you doing in my house ?
who are you ?
i &apos;m marco reyes .
that supposed to mean something to me ?
your brother never mentioned me to you ?
my brother ... no . no , he didn &apos;t .
well , i &apos;m hurt .
matt and i were so close .
what is it that i can do for you ?
your brother took something from me ,
and you &apos;re gonna help me get it back .
