Since Lot was afraid to stay in Zoar,
he and his two daughters settled in the hill country,
ehere he lived in a cave.
The firstborn said to the younger,
'our father is getting old,
'and there is not a man in the land
'to have intercourse with us as is the custom everywhere.
'Come.
'Let us ply our father with wine and then lie with him,
that we may ensure posterity by our father.'
So that night, they plied their father with wine.
And the firstborn went in and lay with her father.
The next day, the firstborn said to the younger,
'let us ply him with wine again tonight.
And then you go in and lie with him.'
So that night, too, they plied their father with wine.
And then the younger one went in
and lay with her father.
And so it was that the two daughters of Lot
became pregnant by their father.
And thus, Lord, we maketh your word our command!
Amen!
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here
in the sight of God and in the face of this family
to join together this --

What do you feel like -- Italian, Thai?
Are we really gonna do this?
Do what? I'm hungry.
Not talk about it.
I'll probably get turned down.
The trial -- nobody gets in this thing.
It's false hope.
Did you hear what the doctor said?
I mean, were you even listening?
I mean, he said the prognosis is --
He said he couldn't predict.
No, he said that the trial was your best shot.
You don't want to do it, fine.
Then do it for me. I can live with that.
Just want to think about it.
There's nothing to think about.
I don't care if you get fat.
I don't care if you lose your hair.
You're applying for this trial.
You're gonna be accepted. Do you understand me?
I am not losing you.
Soon as I get to the office...
I'll make the call.
DMV? Really?
I've never even seen you drive.
That little fella,
the one through the glass, his name is Glen Carter.
His mother calls him "Jelly bean."
A loathsome individual who, sad to say,
possesses an uncanny ability to locate anything.
I presume you've heard of Justin Kenyon?
The smiling public face of the militia movement.
Who hasn't?
Yes. The very voice of reason,
the rebel darling of the fringe right --
charming, rustic, camera-ready,
the perfect spokesman to spin vile hatred and prejudice
into treacly dross that passes for plainspoken common sense.
Forget it.
Excuse me?
Justice knows exactly who Justin Kenyon is.
We know what he is.
The church of the shield is a cesspool
of polygamy, doomsday paranoia,
ritualized elder and child abuse,
but he also has four of the most prominent civil rights attorneys.
in the country on retainer -- we can't touch him.
How do you suppose he pays
for those high-priced lawyers --
Charitable contributions?
His church has been audited
by the I.R.S. every year for the past decade.
His books are impeccable.
So are mine.
Justin Kenyon -- head of the church of the shield,
a polygamist cult located on a 15,000-acre reserve
in the smoky mountains.
Kenyon declared it a nation-state,
and petitioned to secede
in U.S. district court three decades ago.
According to Reddington,
Kenyon has dozens of shipping containers
buried on his property.
Terrorists, cartels,
and criminals contract with him to store cargo,
no questions asked.
Reddington compiled a partial inventory
from his sources.
It includes all manner of contraband.
From drugs and hot merchandise to military ordnance,
antiaircraft guns, missiles, R.P.G.s, Semtex.
Sounds like a one-stop storage facility
for the criminal underworld.
In 1982,
Kenyon published a book entitled "The Silver Bear Prophecies,"
which he purported were delivered to him
by the spirit of an ancient Druid Elder.
In it, he claims to be the latter-day incarnation
of an entity the silver bear called "The Ken'yon."
How convenient.
Ken'yon and his followers will ascend into heaven for six days
and return to -- and I quote...
"Rain fire upon the new Babylon.
"The defiled States of America,
"and our children shall cleanse her streets
with the blood of her founder's enemies."
According to Reddington,
Ken'yon has fallen off the radar.
His clients have been unable to reach him
or anyone on the compound since last saturday.
Which means they don't have access to their stored goods.
As you can imagine,
this makes a number of very dangerous people
very, very nervous.
Not interested. Can't be done.
Glen, you have found things for me with far less to go on.
Ernie's retirement party's tonight.
I got to pick up the shrimp platter.
You found Jerry Minkie's wife
after she ran off with the uber driver,
the one with the Subaru.
I don't even like shrimp.
You found, uh, the other guy -- who was that? -- that...
mobster who was hiding out in needles.
Glen, look, you and I...
We've had our differences,
but I have enormous respect for your abilities.
You know that.
If anyone can help me, it's you.
It's not the shrimp. It's the dip, that sauce.
I don't like sauces.
You know what? Forget it. I don't need this.
What are you so upset about?
There isn't a retirement party, is there?!
You're making it up!
That's what this is about!
This is what you want --
to see me get all lathered up!
You're pathological. You realize that, right?
Ernie's shrimp platter?! You can't be serious!
Do you even see the irony in that?
Tell me about the safe.
Glen, I'm upset!
Your spook friend -- he said it was critical.
As I've already told you,
he said there is a safe in St. Petersburg.
On the second floor of I don't know where --
a bank, an apartment.
He died before he could tell me more.
The spook...
What was his name?
Alan Fitch.
Alan...
Fitch!
Fitch.
Kenyon's been off the grid for three days.
According to his own words, that gives us 72 hours
before he delivers his version of armageddon.
His counsel has assured us nothing is amiss,
and under no circumstances
are we to attempt direct contact.
They've already won two civil judgments
on Kenyon's behalf for harassment.
That was before we knew he was sitting on enough ordnance
to arm a third-world country.
This could all go south fast and end up looking very badly.
I don't give a damn how it looks.
Well, that's a luxury we cannot afford,
not after Waco and Ruby Ridge.
We're looking at a tactical nightmare --
78 square miles of virgin forest,
a mountain stronghold with enough food and potable water
to withstand an armed siege for months.
And even if by some miracle
we manage to put down resistance
and seize that compound without loss of life,
without harm coming to the 26 children who reside there,
what if Reddington is wrong?
Lizzy, exactly when have I been wrong?
I told you -- there are political considerations.
If we raid Kenyon's compound
and come up empty-handed --
You will not come up empty-handed.
But if we do,
then we'll have validated kenyon's allegations
that the federal government are a pack of jackbooted thugs.
We'll have raised him up as a martyr for the Constitution.
That's exactly what he wants.
Lizzy, I have gone to considerable lengths
to point you and your team in the right direction,
and now, due to political considerations,
people will die.
And when they do
and the bureaucrats decide that the loss of innocent lives
trumps their career prospects,
you be sure to give me a call.

Unit B61 to dispatch,
run a check on a late-model chevy van,
Tennessee plate number Delta-Oscar-Charlie-7-7-1.
Unit B261, that tag number is 10-40 stolen,
registered to a 2005 Jeep Cherokee.
Copy?
Copy that.
Show us your hands!
Hands outside the window now!
What the...
Hold your fire!
It's just a --
ATF estimates there was enough Semtex in that van
to level five square blocks.
Anything on the victims?
Vaporized.
The presumed dead include two Alabama State troopers
and the occupant of the van.
We just got footage of the explosion.
Hold your fire! It's just a --
It's just a what?
The V.I.N. numbers on the van's differential
match a vehicle registered to Kenyon's church of the shield.
Judge is signing the search warrant as we speak.
Also, the plates were swapped out
for one stolen off a Cherokee
at a truck stop five miles down the road
from the Kenyon Compound.
I got a hit on another set of plates
stolen from the same location.
Another van passed through a tollbooth
on the MD 200 headed into D.C.
Reddington was right.
If we'd listened to him,
we wouldn't have a gang of fanatics
joyriding with enough ordnance to level a small city.
Ressler and Keen, get to that compound.
The warrant should be sealed and delivered
by the time you arrive.
Navabi, the van -- find out everything you can.
Harold Cooper.
Dr. Levin, hello.
W-was I accepted?
I see.
You know, Jeff, you don't owe me an apology.
I know you did everything you could.
Thank you.
Hey, I just got off the phone with the doctor.
I'm afraid it's...bad news.
I am not taking you to St. Petersburg.
You are if you want to know where the safe is.
How do I even know you've found it?
You don't.
But I got two weeks of vacation I got to take
before the end of the year or I lose it.
It's February!
We could take your jet,
have a few laughs on the way,
Some of those nuts -- the honey-roasted ones.
I want what I paid for --
the location of the safe.
Can I be honest with you?
I doubt it.
I've never been out of the country.
My dad, our vacations as a kid,
we drove everywhere --
South Dakota, Florida.
But you -- I look at you...
and all the places you go...
and I'd just like to do that once.
Plus, I think it'd be fun.
I feel like we might have a good time.
I'm screwing with you!
I was born in London,
but I've never been on a private jet.
Anyway, I clock out at 5:30.
I'll need to stop by the house,
grab a shower,
feed the turtle.
I can have a bag packed and be wheels up by 9:00.
Sheriff, have you met Kenyon?
He makes a habit of coming into town for breakfast.
He's a bit of a blowhard
but always friendly, cooperative.
Plus, the church has provided volunteers for community events,
search-and-rescue operations.
So, what are you suggesting --
We collar this guy
at the next Rotary Club pancake breakfast?
I'm suggesting he can be talked to.
He's reasonable,
and I'm suggesting you let my boys handle this
instead of lighting this whole mountain up
and starting World War Ⅲ.
What are the odds we'll be met with armed resistance?
It's a dead certainty.
You step one foot on Kenyon's land
without his express consent, he'll put a bullet in you,
Badge or no badge.
Now, we've cleared the estimated kill zone,
and we've evacuated the surrounding areas.
We're waiting on a sniper team now.
Hold your fire.
It's just...
a kid.
It's just a kid.
Excuse me, Miss?
Take this.
Hey, h-hold on!
Hey, halt! No!
Return to the firing line!
Do not approach the suspect!
Return to the firing line! Do not approach the suspect!
I'm Samar. What's your name?
Do you know what that does?
You planned on killing a lot of people today.
Was that your mission?
It's not going to happen. Do you see?
They're all too far away.
There's no point now.
It's just the two of us out here.
If you push that button...
Only two of us are going to die.
Do you understand?
Just you and me,
and I don't want to die today.
Do you?
Come on out.
Come on.
Come here, give me your hand.
It's gonna be okay.
Go, go!
Kenyon's unaccounted for.
53 of his followers slaughtered.
No sign of him.
That's puzzling.
It appears all the adults were murdered
and the children are gone.
Kenyon's ideology has always been
about vanquishing the infidels and rising to power,
not about killing their own.
This is a group of survivalists.
They might have been attacked by a rival militia.
We found a number of dead bodies surrounding the perimeter.
And the storage containers?
Located, secured, and searched --
about a dozen of them so far.
They've been pretty much cleaned out --
no weapons, no ordnance.
According to an inventory list,
we're missing small arms, RPGs,
three hellfire missiles,
plus over a ton of semtex,
C4, Demex, and Plastite.
What was that?
That was... a vase.
What about the vehicles?
All the church's vehicles are accounted for,
except for one.
Another bomb.
Something's gone sideways, Lizzy.
Kenyon is the devil we know,
but now either others are involved
or there's been a complete breakdown in the organization.
Either way, be careful out there.
You're sure this is the apartment?
This is the apartment.
You're positive?
Your tone is insulting.
My tone?!
I endured 13 hours with you on my jet,
12 of which you had your shoes off.
You snored.
You insulted my flight attendant!
I thought she was pregnant.
Glen, the safe!
We haven't found it yet, have we?!
I know everything one can possibly know about Alan Fitch.
I worked on this 'round the clock,
and you know how irritable I can be if I don't get my 10 hours.
I've reviewed six years of bank records,
and I traced the cash payment he made
to purchase an apartment in this very building
on this very floor.
Trust me, the safe is here.
I don't trust you.
What the hell is this?
The title to apartment 221.
Apology accepted.
What?
We're in apartment 212.
You don't know the cross that I bear,
the things I've had to overcome --
My dyslexia.
You're not dyslexic.
Raymond.
Oh, really, doctor?
Is that your professional opinion?
Forgot to pack my medication.
I was shocked when you told me I could come along.
It threw me.
I left my dyslexia pills on the counter.
There are no pills for dyslexia.
Get this to Sorenson for a trace on the number.
How old is he?
He's 10.
10?
What the hell are we dealing with here?
I've seen this before in fanatical sects.
The children are indoctrinated from the time they're born,
force-fed by rod and rote --
In this case, the gospel according to Justin Kenyon.
To rain fire upon the New Babylon.
Oh, my god -- coroner's preliminary report
on the massacre at the compound.
What do you got?
Not a shot was fired.
Every single one of those people was stabbed,
strangled, stomped, or bludgeoned to death.
Dear god.
And something else.
A field office in Richmond just got a call
from a former cult member --
Dawn Weston.
Swears our truck bomber is her son.
She's our only surviving witness.
Of a crime committed in my jurisdiction.
That makes her my responsibility.
Look, these are dangerous people.
We have an entire unit
tasked with providing protective custody.
There's no point in hashing this out now.
No matter how this shakes down,
the first thing we need to do
is get that girl safely off this mountain -- agreed?
What are you looking at?
Watchers.
Watchers?
Shh, it's a secret.
I thought he was dead.
Your son, Finnian.
Finn, we always called him.
Finn.
There are some things that you need to understand about Justin,
about the way that things were.
You see, h-his word was not just the law.
It was the word of God himself.
Justin was our oracle.
He was our burning bush.
I understand.
You don't.
You can't,
not unless you were there. You...
God, what have I done?
Tell me.
According to Justin...
Each man was to take unto himself three wives.
Which wasn't a problem in the early days,
but as we began to have children...
He must've seen the flaw in his plan.
What flaw?
There were too many boys, of course.
More than half the children were, you know, male, and so...
He began the walkabout.
The walkabout?
The first new moon in January,
lots would be drawn among the boys.
We would have a great feast in celebration,
and the chosen one would be the guest of honor.
He was treated as a man.
How old were the chosen?
8 or 10.
Just before the onset of puberty.
After the feast, the boy would be awakened
and taken deep into the woods, and then...
You left him there in the middle of nowhere,
in the bitter cold.
He said there were too many.
You're hurt.
I'm okay.
Ressler's pinned.
Ressler, talk to me! You injured?
I don't think anything's broke, but I'm stuck.
I can't... I can't budge this thing.
The radio's shot.
Anybody got cell reception?
Mine's busted.
Somebody live back there?
Not that I know of.
You wait by the car with Amy.
I'm gonna see if I can go get us some help,
check out that smoke.
Keep an eye on that girl.
Shouldn't you be prepping for your confirmation hearing?
It's a no-brainer.
You're looking at the next attorney general.
I'm happy for you, Tom.
For us, Harold, for us.
I want you to consider taking the director's chair.
Tom, I don't know.
It's what we've always talked about.
A rising tide lifts all boats.
I'm flattered, Tom.
But I can't.
I'm not leaving here with a "no."
I'd love to take you up on this, Tom.
You know I would.
But I'm dealing with some...
health issues.
What, Harold? Is it serious?
To be honest with you, yeah. It's very serious.
There was a clinical trial that held out some hope,
but, uh...
Look, you didn't come here to talk about my health.
I'm happy for you. I really am.
Are you in the FBI?
Yes, I am.
My daddy says all the people who work for the FBI
are gonna go to hell.
Some days it feels like that, sweetheart.
He says they're gonna burn in a lake of fire.
Who's there?!
What is it?
Hey, Starkweather!
It's them.
Who?
The watchers.
Sweetie, come here.
Get down, get down!
The only cure for corruption is disruption.
The only cure for corruption is disruption.
The only cure for corruption is disruption.
The only cure for corruption is disruption.
The only cure for corruption is disruption.
The only cure for corruption is disruption.
The only cure for corruption is disruption.
The only cure -- - Finn.
The father said to his servants, "Quick,
put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet."
Do you r-remember me?
Mama?
Yes, Finn.
You're telling me that this attack
was masterminded by a bunch of kids?
Not just kids -- a tribe,
militarily instructed by their elders
from the time they could walk in tracking,
evasion techniques,
hand-to-hand combat, firearm training.
And left to die in the woods?
Starting with Kenyon's own son, David.
Why? Come on, keep going.
The gospel according to Kenyon --
"And each man shall have unto himself three wives."
There were too many boys.
It was the only way to maintain the ratio.
The mountain was supposed to kill the boys,
but it didn't.
It was a crucible. The weak died --
injuries, disease, exposure...
Get out of here! Come on,
Get out!
...but the strong survived,
perfectly adapted, with their own laws,
their own society, their own gods,
chief among which was Justin Kenyon.
"Was"?
David is their leader.
A few weeks ago, he declared his father an apostate.
He said that Justin had abandoned his calling
and that it was up to them
to fulfill the prophecies of Ken'yon.
Did he tell you where this final truck bomb was headed?
The only people who know are the other drivers and David.
I can't raise Liz or Ressler.
Samar, my dear,
bump in the road I can help smooth over,
or have the clouds finally parted
and this is a social call?
She's missing.
Agent Keen?
And Ressler.
They were supposed to deliver a witness two hours ago.
They haven't been seen since they left Kenyon's compound.
Have you mounted a search?
I'm on my way out to assist HRT,
but there are hundreds of square miles of rugged terrain.
It could take days.
The weapons.
Agent Keen said there was a complete inventory list.
You have it?
Well, we have a manifest. Why?
Send it to me.
Ressler!
Raymond!
Oh, that's a shame.
Dendrobium?
My own hybrid.
I call them "snows of Everest."
Lovely.
Friend of yours?
A small accounting problem.
Ruth.
Ruth!
I'm afraid I'll need your undivided attention.
Put on his parka.
Tie him from the back of the snowmobile.
I'll be out in a minute.
Very well.
You have my attention.
Ruth...
I will be forever indebted to you
if you could be so kind as to provide me
with the activation codes for the Hellfire missiles
you have stored at Justin Kenyon's compound.
Yes.
Are you Navabi?
Yeah.
It's for you.
This is Samar.
Agent Navabi, what do you know about Hellfire missiles?
What does that have to do with anything?
Quite a lot, actually.
There were three of them stolen from the compound.
I've since acquired their activation codes.
You're going to launch three Hellfire missiles?
Don't be silly.
We just activated the cameras in their nose cones.
I've seen quite a lot of activity,
but, then, boys will be boys.
Liz and Ressler?
Not sure.
I have... two other views,
Only one of any tactical value.
It looks like they're in some sort of large hand-built structure.
Where? - Funny you should ask -- in standby mode,
the guidance systems ping GPS coordinates every 30 seconds.
You ready?
Go.
Who are you?
My name's Elizabeth.
This isn't about me or the others, father.
This is about you -- your legacy, not mine!
You think I haven't seen it?
Read it?
Prevarications and betrayals.
Tell me who you are.
You've denied the Lord
a thousand times...
Who's in charge?
Kenyon.
...spending too much time
I want to talk to him.
among the infidels...
Only David talks to Kenyon.
You disgust me.
David! David!
What?
What?!
The prisoner wants to talk to you.
Caleb, watch the road.
Make sure nobody else comes.
Where are the others?
Amy's safe, along with the others.
She's gonna be one of my wives.
We're all gonna get married -- all of us.
As prescribed by Kenyon.
And the man? Ressler?
What have you done with him?
See?
He's alive.
Freeze! Move away from him!
Step away from him!
I said freeze!
Federal agents! Get on the ground!
Back off!
Are you okay?
Yeah.
Kenyon's upstairs.
Get this guy right here.
Get him out of here.
He's gone.
Kenyon.
Stand down! We found the...
What?
The third van.
Get these kids out of here!
See if you can locate those missing girls.
They've got to be around here somewhere.
Call for backup.
No backup!
Just round up these kids
with the personnel we've got and clear out.
Yes, ma'am.
Don't come any closer!
I've got 300 pounds of explosives in this van!
Go ahead.
It's what he wanted, isn't it?
What do you know?
I know your father...
wanted you dead.
He sent us out there to make us stronger,
to be warriors, to fulfill his prophecy!
All those boys --
they wouldn't have made it if it weren't for you,
taking them in, teaching them how to survive.
Your father never wanted them.
He never wanted you.
But you're not your father, David.
You're better than him.
You're right.
I am.
Coward!
ATF's been over the grounds.
They've searched the buried containers.
If you're wondering about what you stored there,
it's long gone.
What's this?
A key.
I bought you an apartment at the Audrey,
top floor, splendid view of the Potomac.
Why?
It's time to leave the motel behind.
I'm happy where I am. Thank you.
You've been many things lately, Lizzy,
but happy is not one of them.
That motor lodge you call home crushes the spirit,
smothers the soul.
And you think a view is gonna change that?
I once stayed at a villa in Bali
with a view of the Indian Ocean.
Every morning, all I saw before me was...
possibility.
That and a gorgeous housekeeper named Putu, who used to --
Thanks, but, no, thanks.
I wish you'd stop.
Stop what?
Trying.
Stop hoping things are gonna get better between us.
You and me, it's just business.
That's all it's ever gonna be.
Single malt.
Highland, if memory serves.
I got you in.
Tom, I thought I was clear.
I appreciate you thinking I'd be a good director, but --
Screw the director. I got you into the trial.
At Georgetown.
What?
How?
Good questions.
I know a guy who knows a guy.
Wait.
Am I taking another patient's spot?
Because... I couldn't accept that. That wouldn't be right.
Righteous to the end.
Relax.
It was going to be 35 patients, and now it'll be 36.
Thank you, Tom.
There are good ships...
and there are wood ships.
The ships that sail the sea.
But the best ships are friendships.
And may they always be.
The number from the safe traces to a blind exchange.
We can't identify the party you'll be speaking to.
Yes.
I'm calling on behalf Alan Fitch.
The safe.
You found the safe?
Who the hell is this?
