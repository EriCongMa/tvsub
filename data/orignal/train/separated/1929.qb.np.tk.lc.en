&quot; got to be real &quot;
on an operating table ,
a person is at his most vulnerable -- naked , exposed .
i do not need another sister .
get out .
i mean , she &apos;s a lying liar .
i would know if my mother were pregnant when i was 5 .
my mother was not pregnant when i was 5 .
get out .
she &apos;s , like , psycho , like a stalker .
i &apos;m being stalked . alex , this is criminal .
i mean , you --
what &apos;s your problem ?
get out ! i &apos;m naked here !
okay , so what ? i &apos;ve seen it before !
no big deal ! i &apos;m in crisis !
okay , fine . it &apos;s -- your junk is spectacular .
jo is a very lucky girl .
can we get back to me now ?
why are you making that face ?
mer , i realize that i said i would take over as your person .
maybe that means i have to buy your tampons
and act like your husband &apos;s hair is special and crap .
but i have a very important presentation
to make to the board today to get a job ,
which i need because i got fired by dr. butthole !
i have been practicing all night .
i am sleep @-@ deprived .
i need to shower -- alone -- and focus !
you didn &apos;t even hear what i said !
no . and i don &apos;t care .
the new cardio chief thinks she &apos;s my biological sister .
she what ? wait .
what ? ! that &apos;s insane .
thank you .
he &apos;s in the shower ,
and she &apos;s in the bathroom with him while he &apos;s in the shower .
so , go in there with them .
no ! i am not going in there .
you &apos;re the girlfriend .
no . yeah , i am , but i &apos;m not .
they &apos;re this little team together .
they are war buddies , and i don &apos;t fit .
and then they look at me -- well , she looks at me --
like i &apos;m just the stupid , naked girl in alex &apos;s bed .
so go be the stupid , naked girl in alex &apos;s shower .
i am a doctor .
i am a surgeon . i deserve respect .
you &apos;re a girl in her pajamas
with her ear to the door of a bathroom .
how much respect can anyone give you right now ?
she stole my alex .
you know what ? i miss cristina yang .
when cristina yang was here , nobody stole my alex .
oh , my god . you &apos;re scared of meredith grey .
no , i &apos;m not . are you ?
no .
hi , dr. grey .
tell alex i &apos;ll be downstairs .
and if anybody asks you , i am sick .
skin is not a very tough armor .
it &apos;s soft , easily broken .
okay , i &apos;m only here to give a speech
on residual limb health , and that is it .
that is it .
yeah , i got to pull back , okay ?
we have a kid .
arizona is starting a fellowship .
we &apos;re trying to have another kid .
i am stretched out far too thin .
i completely understand .
i said no already .
i know that . you &apos;re just gonna meet a couple guys . come on .
navy seals , green berets , army rangers .
wounded warriors from the most badass specialized ops forces
in the u.s. military .
but ...
you &apos;re too busy to help our nation &apos;s heroes , so ...
i do not like you .
then i directed the rfa needle to where the blood supply
entered the abnormal parabiotic tissue mass .
to interrupt the blood flow to the abnormal fetus .
yes . then i removed excess amniotic fluid .
nice . and then she delivered full @-@ term ?
she did -- months after i completed
the operation that i &apos;m telling you about .
why are you not taking notes ?
oh . sorry . i thought we were just , you know , talking .
and i thought you were my fellow .
i am -- completely .
no , i &apos;m so excited to be your fellow .
i just need a little -- little time
to get up to speed , you know , like four ...
... three -- three weeks .
yeah , &apos; cause i have a lot of cases on my --
dr. robbins , for the purposes of this fellowship ,
we are not peers .
and four weeks is 10 % of the average gestational age .
in that amount of time ,
a fetus &apos;s lungs become a fully functioning organ .
everything in utero happens at hyper speed .
and the sooner you get up to that speed , the better .
get a notepad .
avery , i &apos;ve got a backlog of some cases .
amy &apos;s doing a great job ,
but there &apos;s some stuff i got to get on top of .
so , you need help ?
i need you to reschedule this meeting for tonight .
no .
oh , are we rescheduling the meeting ? oh , thank god ,
because callie and i have an appointment tonight ,
and apparently , i &apos;ve already started my fellowship .
we are not rescheduling the meeting .
tomorrow work for you ?
no , tomorrow &apos;s bad . thursday ?
listen to me speak , all right ?
we are voting on a new member of the board .
it &apos;s happening tonight . understood ?
derek !
derek , why is there suddenly an order
for carbamazepine in eric schneider &apos;s chart ?
he needed a good anti @-@ convulsant .
and i had already written him one for valproic acid .
you can &apos;t go around writing orders on my patients .
i &apos;m doing my job .
no , you are doing my job .
i am chief of neurosurgery .
if you have a problem with that ,
you should take it up with the board .
until then , i will call you when i need you .
what happened to the two diverting loop ileostomies i had today ?
you &apos;re welcome .
so you had the easiest day possible .
you are going up against karev , so i figured you &apos;d want
plenty of time to practice your board presentation .
i don &apos;t need to practice .
i need my schedule back the way it was .
you sure , though ?
karev &apos;s pretty tight with some board members .
so am i.
well , meredith grey was in the bathroom with karev this morning .
well , not that tight .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m saying .
look , edwards ...
i am going to walk in there and tell the truth .
i deserve this .
and if any one of them has the misguided impression
that there is any choice at all in this matter ,
i will set that person on the righteous path
before he or she can reveal him-
or herself as a moron .
oh . pileup on i @-@ 5 . trauma coming in .
why are they paging me ? isn &apos;t grey on the pit today ?
she &apos;s sick .
if my mother were pregnant , i would have known .
adoption agency made a mistake ?
and randomly put the name &quot; ellis grey &quot;
on a birth certificate ?
i don &apos;t think so .
pierce has got to want something .
maybe she thinks there &apos;s money to inherit .
the only thing you inherit in this family is alzheimer &apos;s .
whoa . dark .
good one , though , huh ? yeah .
she &apos;s not my sister .
you know who you should ask about this ?
the guy who was banging your mom back then .
i &apos;m not asking richard webber .
all i &apos;m saying is , he &apos;s got skin in the game .
disgusting .
he &apos;s the only living person who would know if it &apos;s true .
richard webber is like a second father to me ,
and if he knew that i had a sister , he would tell me !
paged to the e.r. ?
yes .
you ?
mm @-@ hmm .
sounds big .
mm @-@ hmm .
i told her last night .
how &apos;d it go ?
could have gone better .
give me some room , please ! everyone , please !
what the hell is this ?
what &apos;s going on ?
37 @-@ year @-@ old male rear @-@ ended a lumber truck .
anyone who is not treating this patient ,
please move out of the way .
hey , hey , hey ! you heard the woman !
this is not a spectacle for your amusement .
holy --
cool ! i &apos;m sorry .
edwards !
get a close @-@ up !
okay , we need to get this man on his back in less than 60 seconds .
got to work faster .
one more inch to the right , he &apos;d be d.o.a.
how you want to proceed ?
ultrasound &apos;s negative for fluid around the heart ,
so i would do a laparotomy .
his airway is compromised .
he needs a chest tube and intubation now .
yeah , we &apos;re almost done here , okay ?
it &apos;ll be safer on his back .
no , there &apos;s no time .
i &apos;ll have to go in nasally . 7 @-@ 0 e.t.tube ?
charlie , i hate to tell you this ,
but your day is actually about to get a little worse .
hold the work !
hold on , charlie .
hold on .
almost there .
okay .
okay , push 100 of propofol , please .
pushing
here we go .
well done , doctor .
sorry ?
i said very good !
uh , okay . he &apos;s clear .
on his back on my count .
one ... two ... and three .
you want to give me a robot leg , like the terminator ?
robotic ,
more like the six @-@ million @-@ dollar man .
uh , actually , it costs a little more than that .
but the project is fully funded , all expenses paid .
the leg will be free .
a free six @-@ million @-@ dollar robot leg ?
listen .
i &apos;ve been through three prosthetic legs .
each one hurt more than the last .
why is this so --
well , the leg is entirely painless .
free , pain @-@ free robot leg ?
sounds made up .
it was made up -- by dr. torres .
it is cutting @-@ edge technology . dr. torres is a genius .
you &apos;ll be amazed at this --
okay , let &apos;s just slow down for a minute .
we still have to run a number of tests
to make sure you &apos;re even a candidate for the study .
but , again , the program is fully funded .
unbelievable .
major hunt was right .
he &apos;s been going on and on about you .
yeah , i bet .
i told him how busy i am . he knows .
he knows my plate is full . he just doesn &apos;t care .
i am an attending with an entire service of my own .
herman and i have shared dozens of patients before .
oh , and now he &apos;s just bringing this guy to my lab , right ?
like i &apos;m gonna say no to a guy
who gave up his leg for our country .
she has me reviewing journals and doing skills labs .
i have a case report that &apos;s due by 4 : 00 .
i &apos;m sorry . ex cuse me .
i have a neuroblastoma to remove at 4 : 00 .
wait .
is this your way of telling me that you &apos;re canceling
our meeting with the surrogacy agency tonight ?
what ? no ! w-- no , i will -- i will figure that out .
okay . i just ...
say something to help me .
you own a hospital .
you are a raising a beautiful girl .
you save babies . you &apos;re gonna save more , right ?
you can do this , too .
if anyone can , you can .
oh .
oh . okay .
um , listen , i will meet you at the agency with a smile on my face .
and we will get ourselves a new baby .
yeah .
a.b.c. &apos; s intact .
i need to assess his gcs .
if you &apos;d be quiet , he &apos;s trying to talk now .
sir , can you tell me your name ? what &apos;s your name ?
steve .
forget your helmet today , steve ?
aah . it hurts .
i &apos;m giving you something for the pain .
you might start to feel sleepy now .
it &apos;s a depressed skull fracture .
it is pretty deep . we &apos;re gonna need a c.t.
and because of the position , probably an angio .
i can make that decision if you &apos;ll give me room to look .
amy , i don &apos;t think he &apos;s gonna make it ,
and it &apos;s gonna get ugly , so let me do it .
ah . because only you can save him now .
screw you . i &apos;ve got him .
maybe you can both take him -- like a team , or a family .
i have him . kepner , you &apos;ll assist .
let &apos;s take him up to c.t.
the african outreach program has given 34 kids
excellent outcomes and a chance they never would have had .
and it gave me something , too .
starting that program gave me a sense of ownership
and a -- and a level of passion that i didn &apos;t know i could have .
i have this passion for this hospital .
i look forward to --
mer .
huh ? yeah , it &apos;s great .
you &apos;re gonna vote on this . i don &apos;t want to blow this .
and it &apos;s bailey .
bailey did deliver my baby and save my life .
what have you ever done ?
why aren &apos;t you at your own house ,
drinking and having bitch baby tears
about your fake sister with your husband ?
derek doesn &apos;t know .
he doesn &apos;t know ?
i can &apos;t talk to him right now .
oh , come on . he gave up the job in d.c.
he &apos;s staying , and you &apos;re still mad ?
you won .
no .
i never asked him to stay . this wasn &apos;t a compromise .
i didn &apos;t win . he forfeited , so we both lost .
so you &apos;re not talking to him ?
he &apos;s walking around like he &apos;s a martyr ,
waiting for me to be grateful .
i am not grateful .
my career is just as important as his !
i &apos;m the sun .
i &apos;m the sun .
and he can go suck it !
i &apos;m the sun .
all right . we &apos;re done .
hey !
you can sit here and get drunk and then vomit and cry ,
and i can never get any prep for my presentation done ,
or we can do something about this .
you want to do something about this ?
it &apos;s so light .
it &apos;s a 100 % titanium body and 13 sensors .
but before we can get you in a leg like this ,
we need your muscles and nerves to interface with the sensors .
so , this electromyogram will show spikes
when your muscles contract
and then go flat when they rest , okay ?
all right . go ahead and flex for me , jeff .
when this is done , i get to keep it ?
well , it &apos;s all funded , including follow @-@ up , so ...
yes .
sorry . i @-@ i know how that sounds .
it &apos;s just , all i wanted was to be a ranger , you know ?
i still dream about it all the time --
pack on my back , running , my team .
then i wake up and get out of bed .
i try to stand , and i forget about it .
so , you know , when you say &quot; free robot leg , &quot;
i think i &apos;m still dreaming of running with the guys .
jeff , are you still flexing ?
yeah .
can i take a picture of it ?
yeah .
my mom is gonna freak .
jeff , flex harder for me .
what ?
i should be seeing readings .
what -- what &apos;s going on ?
uh , w @-@ we &apos;re just having trouble with the e.m.g.
no , no . it &apos;s not the e.m.g.
jeff , i &apos;m
dr. torres , can i talk to you for a moment
excuse us , jeff .
that was inappropriate .
inappropriate ? you were about to reject him from the study .
yes . you saw those readings .
look , the way his amputation was performed ,
there &apos;s no way this will work .
okay , it &apos;s a crappy amputation , owen .
probably because it was done in less @-@ than @-@ ideal circumstances .
he is a soldier , callie .
i know that , okay ?
i feel bad about that , all right ?
i care about that . i really do . you know who doesn &apos;t care ?
you know who doesn &apos;t give a damn about his service ?
the robot leg .
all the robot cares about is that the nerves in his leg
aren &apos;t communicating with his muscles ,
which means they can &apos;t communicate with the sensors in the prosthesis ,
which means the robot leg won &apos;t work .
then you can find a way to help him .
just -- just figure it out .
i &apos;m sorry . are you not listening to me , owen ?
are you deliberately being obtuse ?
i just told you his nerves ...
just fix it .
just get back in there -- - i just told you i can &apos;t !
fix it ! that is an order !
oh , an order ?
who -- who are you -- general patton ?
i &apos;m your chief of surgery .
on the surgical floor , you are my chief .
in my lab , funded by the money that i procured ,
i am in charge !
are we clear ? !
no , you don &apos;t get these guys &apos; hopes up
and then leave them with nothing !
no , no , no . no , i didn &apos;t do that , owen .
you did that .
you &apos;re the one out there running your mouth at the rehab center about
&quot; free , pain @-@ free six @-@ million @-@ dollar man robot legs ! &quot;
i &apos;m about to go in there and crush his dreams because of you !
we &apos;re gonna pull on my count . we ready ?
one ...
two ...
three .
easy .
easy .
okay , kelly clamp .
apply pressure .
got it .
more suction . i need to see or feel .
okay .
that &apos;s got to be the fastest splenectomy i &apos;ve ever seen .
yeah , this isn &apos;t my first rodeo .
i hope i &apos;m that fast someday .
you will be .
in about 4,000 rodeos .
so , i hear you and hunt had a little episode in the hallway .
he told on me .
you can write me up all you want for insubordination ,
but i stand by the fact
that i do not take orders regarding my own lab .
and hunt can kiss my
i &apos;m not asking you
to take orders in your own lab .
what i &apos;m asking is maybe that you not have a screaming match
in the middle of the hallways of the hospital ,
because when members of the board cause a scene ,
i have to stop practicing medicine , which i love doing ,
and become a hall monitor , which i don &apos;t really love doing .
i got to come down here
and lecture you about responsibility and honor
and crap i really don &apos;t want to be lecturing you about .
you know , i &apos;m down to three procedures a day , okay ?
if i &apos;m lucky . not even long procedures .
i &apos;m sucking fat , lifting boobs , butts .
butt implants are huge .
i just want a good , intense , smart surgery .
you know , like , uh , the ones where your feet hurt ,
when your feet hurt because you &apos;ve been on them for hours .
or your mind hurts because you &apos;ve had to improvise and paint --
surgeries of joy .
but no , i can &apos;t have those ,
&apos;cause i run the board .
grey calls in sick .
your wife tries to give up peds surgery on me .
and boy shepherd &apos;s in a pissing match
with girl shepherd , which they won &apos;t admit .
and yang screws us with bailey versus karev .
and i think richard has
the hots for the new cardio god ,
maggie or whatever ?
which is gross , &apos; cause she is 12 .
so , now you and hunt are running around screaming at each other ?
i don &apos;t get to be a surgeon .
i &apos;m a hall monitor .
i will stop screaming in the hallways .
all right , what &apos;s wrong ?
hunt &apos;s got this bug up his butt
about a candidate for my robotic limb project ,
and ... as much as he wants it to happen , those nerves
are not communicating with those muscles ,
and there &apos;s -- there &apos;s nothing i can do about it .
i can .
targeted muscle reinnervation .
i create an alternate traffic route for the nerve signals .
it &apos;s like , um , if there &apos;s construction on the highway ,
you pick a side street , right ?
i can dissect a nerve at its current location ...
and rewire it wherever you need it .
connection established .
you are wasted as a hall monitor .
i know !
well ... i am done here .
lung crisis averted .
okay . partial gastrectomy and splenectomy done .
we can start the diaphragm repair .
this was , i have to say ,
the most fun i have had since i got here .
well , you &apos;ve done some very good work .
me ? you -- that was amazing .
what was that -- a @-@ a 15 @-@ second splenectomy ?
well , 20 .
18 . i might have stolen a peek at the clock .
well , it was inspiring . i &apos;m glad i was here .
thank you all .
i will check on him in post @-@ op .
the bowels seem to be intact ,
but we &apos;re gonna run it again just to be sure .
bailey , you have this ?
indeed , we do .
i need your username and password .
this is illegal .
we &apos;re just logging into the hospital system .
to get maggie pierce &apos;s personnel file
to get her date of birth , which is illegal .
yeah , so is pretending to be someone you &apos;re not .
now , put in your password .
once we figure out when she was born ,
there &apos;s got to be something we can use
to prove that your mom wasn &apos;t pregnant at the time --
you know , photos or a video or something .
you can call pierce &apos;s bluff .
you &apos;re a very different person than cristina .
cristina and i would just be dancing by now .
yeah . i know .
here we go . look at that .
pierce &apos;s birthday -- november 22 , 1983 .
so , basically , your mom would have been knocked up
around , uh ... spring of &apos; 83 .
what was going on in the spring of &apos; 83 ?
what ?
that &apos;s when she tried to kill herself .
so , that &apos;s done .
maybe you want to practice your speech on me .
or maybe i want to focus
on making sure mr. hays is stable post @-@ op .
but karev --
okay , edwards , i am afraid of snakes .
i &apos;m afraid of large spiders .
and while it might not be rational ,
i am occasionally afraid there might be a shark
waiting for me in a public swimming pool .
why would there be a shark
waiting for you -- - i said it wasn &apos;t rational .
i am afraid of those things .
what i am not afraid of is alex karev .
you shouldn &apos;t be .
you should be afraid of everyone else .
say more .
alex karev is the closest thing
meredith grey has to a brother .
he lives in her old house .
he started a program that brought a daughter into her life .
robbins is karev &apos;s mentor .
torres is married to robbins .
so whoo ! team karev .
jackson avery -- friend of alex karev .
we used to double @-@ date .
speaking of which , avery has a history of making wrong choices .
oh . hey , dr. herman .
sorry i don &apos;t have that case report in to you yet .
i &apos;ve got this neuroblastoma on this baby ,
and the mom got really overreactive ,
and so i @-@ i had to reassure her .
dr. robbins , in fetal surgery , every patient you treat
will come encased in a mother --
a mother whose heightened state of concern
is a biological and evolutionary necessity .
if you lack the basic skills to --
no , i don &apos;t . i don &apos;t . no . no . huh @-@ unh .
moms are kind of like my thing . i &apos;m great with moms .
i actually teach other people how to be great with moms .
yeah , no , you can ask anyone .
i need your start paperwork .
right . i just need to get caught up on that .
i am great with moms !
i know !
it was right after that she moved us to boston .
i mean , i was 5 .
all my memories of boston are so hazy .
do you remember your mom getting suddenly fat ,
then suddenly not fat ?
alex , that whole time was just a blur .
everything that happened after she tried to kill herself
was just a blur for me .
i don &apos;t want to talk about this anymore .
let &apos;s just keep working on your speech .
i &apos;m not working on my speech .
i &apos;m going through the emergency @-@ room admits
for seattle grace in june of 1983 .
what ? how ?
we computerized this like two years ago .
how are you on the board and i &apos;m not ?
wait . right there .
there it is .
well , don &apos;t click on it , because i &apos;m not --
i &apos;m not sure i &apos;m ready to see this .
are you ever ready for this stuff ?
&quot; patient admitted with wrist lacerations
and loss of blood . &quot;
scroll down . scroll down .
beta @-@ hcg came back positive .
she was pregnant .
look in the notes .
&quot; advised patient of pregnancy .
patient was unaware of pregnancy when admitted . &quot;
she &apos;s my sister .
i owe you an apology .
were you going to give me one , or is this just a heads @-@ up ?
i &apos;m sorry , okay ?
we &apos;re okay ?
no ! n-- come back here !
come back and say a bunch of crap to make me understand
why you were yelling at me and giving me orders
and generally being a big old ass .
no , we &apos;re not okay .
i need something to be ...
good .
to ...
i need something to feel right .
okay , i &apos;m not depressed .
i &apos;m not -- my heart is not broken .
i &apos;m not grieving .
she &apos;s not dead . she &apos;s out there .
she &apos;s living out her dreams ,
and i know -- i know she &apos;s happy ,
and that makes me feel proud for her .
but there is this other feeling
that doesn &apos;t completely feel fair or right or good .
she goes on , day in and day out , happy , without me .
but every morning , i wake up , and there &apos;s this pit ,
this feeling here that ...
maybe my dreams are over .
maybe -- maybe i had my dreams and they &apos;re over now .
and i &apos;m gonna be this single guy .
no wife , no kids , no family .
she was my family .
and now she &apos;s someplace else , and i let her go , and ...
it &apos;s good that i did .
i mean , it &apos;s better -- for her .
but for me ...
so i need something to be good .
i need a reason to get up every morning ,
to not crawl back into that cave
that i was in before i met her .
i mean , you know she saved me ?
you were there . you remember how i was .
i was -- i was ...
dark .
that war made me dark .
and that darkness -- it is still in me .
she just lit it up .
so i just thought -- i just thought ...
maybe to beat back that darkness ,
i would -- i would do some good .
i &apos;d just ... do something good .
i &apos;d go be with those guys who &apos;d remind me ...
i just need something to be good .
that &apos;s why i dragged you to that rehab center .
that &apos;s why i , um ...
... wanted you to help .
that &apos;s why i pushed too hard , and t @-@ that &apos;s it .
i &apos;m not gonna talk about it anymore , okay ?
so just -- just say that we &apos;re okay , okay ?
okay .
great .
owen ?
for god &apos;s sakes , callie .
no , i just -- i was just gonna ask if you wanted to --
i was just gonna ask if you wanted to watch jeff &apos;s surgery .
jackson &apos;s doing a little targeted muscle reinnervation .
he &apos;s moving the nerves
to where they can talk to the robot sensors .
want to watch ?
how &apos;s our motorcycle guy ?
my motorcycle guy ?
i fixed him , like a boss .
like your boss , actually .
amy , you &apos;re an excellent surgeon .
you have nothing to prove .
oh , i know i don &apos;t .
but if you try and fight me over the leadership
of this department , you will lose .
my resume will kick your resume &apos;s ass .
i am better than you .
oh , my god , derek .
there is no limit to your narcissist .
i have been playing this game longer than you at a much higher level .
that is all there is to it .
bite me .
where did she go ? dr. shepherd ?
i &apos;m dr. shepherd .
yeah , i @-@ i know . ms. dr. shepherd .
her post @-@ op c.t.s are back .
let me see them .
i ... shouldn &apos;t .
kepner , i am dr. shepherd .
so , we repaired the subdural bleed , but --
that is a big aneurysm .
yeah . it &apos;s grown . it &apos;s way bigger than it was before .
okay , book an o.r. and scrub in .
okay . i &apos;ll let her know .
no , with me , kepner . you &apos;re gonna scrub in with me .
it &apos;s her patient .
well , it just got too big for her .
tell her or don &apos;t tell her .
just prep an o.r. and scrub in .
okay . so , now what are you gonna do ?
go talk to her ?
well , i called richard , and he &apos;s coming over .
is that okay ?
yeah , sure .
it &apos;s just , you know ...
we &apos;ve got this board meeting thing ,
and i don &apos;t want to rush you , but i got to go get ready ,
and you got to be at this meeting , too .
alex , you &apos;re prepared .
your speech is great .
why are you so --
because i want this , mer .
you know ? i don &apos;t just need a job .
yang thought i could do something bigger ,
and for the first time , i feel like i can , too .
you know , i @-@ i feel like i should really ...
like i have something to offer .
and i &apos;m scared to death ,
and i don &apos;t want it to go like crap , all right ?
take all the time you need .
thank you .
when did you know ?
i found out the night i met maggie pierce .
you didn &apos;t know ? ellis didn &apos;t tell you ?
believe me , don &apos;t you think ...
when pierce asked about your mother ,
i felt like i was being hit by a car .
and when she asked about you ...
i ...
when was that ?
the night of the mass casualty --
the mall explosion .
that was a week ago .
so , you knew i had a sister
and you had a daughter ,
and you didn &apos;t tell me ?
you didn &apos;t tell her .
i tried .
what the hell is wrong with you ?
don &apos;t you think i want to ?
i tried . i tried again today .
well , when are you planning on doing it ?
i would have liked to do it 30 years ago !
i would like to have been a father !
to know my child !
to have a say !
but your mother stole that chance from me .
gown and glove me .
i don &apos;t believe you .
i don &apos;t believe you !
suction . amy , you don &apos;t have to scrub in .
i want to be sterile when i come over there
and stick that bovie in your eye .
kepner , move ! you &apos;re on my list .
you have put me in an awful position .
amy , he never had a good prognosis .
i went endovascularly to fix the aneurysm ,
but he starting re @-@ bleeding .
i can see that .
fibrin glue .
now , why is that suction not working ?
okay , can somebody change the canister ?
got it .
amy ...
i see it .
100 of mannitol , 125 of solu @-@ medrol .
he &apos;s gonna herniate .
he may not have time to herniate !
he &apos;s in florid d.i.c.
he &apos;s not clotting anymore .
knox , check his pupils .
fixed and dilated . there &apos;s no gag reflex .
he &apos;s probably already brain @-@ dead .
the next thing i heard ,
she had moved you to boston .
she never said a thing to me about being pregnant .
i had no choice in the matter . i --
she knew , and -- and she left .
i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s just ...
we had an amazing day today .
and she &apos;s someone i &apos;d very much like to know .
so , she came here looking for answers
about her biological mother .
you are her answer .
you have to tell her .
don &apos;t make her wait .
i mean , ellis made the decision for you .
don &apos;t do that to pierce .
so , you &apos;re re @-@ routing the deep peroneal
with the biceps femoris ?
exactly .
you know , if you made this process
part of the initial amputation ,
you could cut out the second surgery altogether .
add -- what -- 2 , 3 minutes to the initial surgery ?
that could make a world of difference .
that &apos;s a great idea , actually .
thanks .
avery , did i mention that hunt and i
are starting a special project with veterans ?
we are ?
we are .
we are taking a chunk of my research money
and focusing it on prosthetics for vets --
free , pain @-@ free , right ?
right . right .
that sounds great .
that is good for the hospital . good work , guys .
you want in ?
i mean , unless you &apos;re too busy
with butt implants , hall monitoring .
yeah , well , i guess you would benefit
from having a good plastics guy who knows nerves .
ew . ew . that was so weak .
did you see him trying to
pretend he already had friends on the playground ?
yeah , don &apos;t pretend that you have friends on the playground .
he tried to be cool .
don &apos;t try to be cool . it &apos;s sad .
don &apos;t try to be cool .
shut up .
adding on this reinnervation ,
it revolutionizes the whole thing .
i mean , the potential for control
these patients can have is -- is --
it &apos;s incredible .
i mean , i could change the way the world does amputations .
sounds like you really want to do this .
i @-@ i do .
i do !
and i know it &apos;ll take so much time ,
and -- and we &apos;ll be stretched so , so thin .
but i really think that --
so , wait .
so , are you saying that maybe we should wait on this baby ?
what ? no .
no , no . why would you say that ?
no . because you just said it was gonna be too much to juggle .
and you &apos;re supposed to say , &quot; it &apos;s not a problem .
&quot; you can do it , callie . we can do it all . &quot;
you &apos;re -- you &apos;re supposed to support me
the way that i &apos;ve been supporting you
ever since you decided
you needed to start this fellowship .
but what if we can &apos;t ?
i mean , what if we can &apos;t do anything and everything ?
are you saying you don &apos;t want to ...
are you saying you don &apos;t want a baby ?
&apos;cause , then , w @-@ what are we doing here ?
why -- why are we meeting with this lady
who &apos;s gonna help us find someone to help us make a baby
if you don &apos;t want a baby ?
don &apos;t put words in my mouth .
this was my idea . i --
yeah , but y @-@ you don &apos;t want to carry it ,
and then i couldn &apos;t , and you still didn &apos;t want to carry it ,
and then we find this ,
and then you find something else to do .
oh , my god . it &apos;s so obvious .
i can &apos;t believe it .
say it .
just say the words . you don &apos;t want a baby .
hi .
35 @-@ year @-@ old male admitted status
post @-@ ejection from a motorcycle without a helmet .
head c.t. revealed --
what ?
i &apos;ll do the op note if you want .
you gonna steal this part , too ?
stealing ? no , i &apos;m just trying to help .
this guy was a lost cause .
whether he was or wasn &apos;t , he was my responsibility ,
and i didn &apos;t need your help ,
and i don &apos;t need any more of your bullying .
bullying ? i am trying to be nice .
look , i get it !
you were king of all neurosurgeons ,
right hand to the president .
and now you can &apos;t have that ,
so you need to be king of the hospital
and kick around the peons .
you of all people should understand
that this was the future of neuroscience .
i mean , this is what we would &apos;ve dreamt of in med school
if we &apos;d thought it was even possible that it could be done .
then you shouldn &apos;t have given it up .
but the least you can do is stop stomping around here
punishing people for a choice you made .
i didn &apos;t make a choice .
meredith made a choice and backed me into a corner .
and because i love my kids and i love my wife
and i want to do what &apos;s best for her --
i do . i want to give her everything .
but something like this will not come again .
this is it . this is as high as i go .
i have never taken a step back in my career ever .
i &apos;ve never felt like this before ,
and i feel like she forced me .
okay , well , i know the feeling ,
because it is happening to me right now .
i &apos;m -- i &apos;m not trying to --
no , i know that you &apos;re not trying to ,
but you are , derek !
you are doing it to me .
and meredith -- you say that you want her to have everything ,
but not if it interferes with you having your everything .
and it is not fair , and i am saying no , too ,
because you have to live with the choices you make .
i am trying to .
i am trying .
i know .
we &apos;re all trying .
it &apos;s just , no one wants to give up ...
or give in .
and no one should .
right ?
time for the board meeting .
okay .
how &apos;s our masterpiece doing ?
good . he &apos;s good .
great . you coming ?
yeah , no , i &apos;m just gonna be a minute .
i &apos;m , um ... just reviewing his chart .
want to make sure everything &apos;s perfect
since they are gonna be teaching this in med schools .
i know , right ? it &apos;s crazy .
let &apos;s go .
i &apos;ll make sure that she gets there .
uh , a @-@ all right , fine . don &apos;t be late .
um , a @-@ and actually , the three of us ,
we should , you know , meet --
get together , talk about timelines , protocol .
yeah , i &apos;ll fill you in on the funding stuff ,
and we &apos;ll figure out a subject pipeline .
okay .
you okay ?
yeah . i just , um ...
i need something to be good , too .
okay .
all right .
how sobby do i look ? 1 to 10 .
6 .
okay .
so , how &apos;d it go today ?
did meredith help you with your speech ?
uh , not really .
if this doesn &apos;t work out ,
i hear radioshack &apos;s hiring .
she must have helped some .
i mean , you guys were at the house together all day .
yeah , well , she &apos;s got a lot of stuff going on .
do i have pit stains ?
what kind of stuff ?
oh , nothing . don &apos;t worry about it .
you sure i look okay ?
yeah . you look great .
dr. karev .
dr. bailey .
i &apos;ll tell them you &apos;re on your way .
pierce ?
hey ! dr. webber !
did you check in on our impalement patient ?
he is doing great !
i need to tell you something .
i should have told you sooner .
okay .
ellis grey and i knew each other --
very well .
we had a relationship --
oh , my god . oh , my god . stop talking .
it &apos;s funny , but that is the first thing i thought
when we first spoke and you told me that
you &apos;d known my mother .
i thought , &quot; what if it &apos;s him ? &quot;
but then you never said anything .
and then days went by , and you still never said anything ,
so i thought it couldn &apos;t possibly be true ,
because what kind of person
would do something like that --
would let me sit there and talk like an idiot
and never speak up ?
no one decent . no one honest .
a coward .
the only reason that you would do something like that ...
is if you &apos;d known about me all along
and never wanted me , either .
no . no , that &apos;s not true . that &apos;s not --
why should i believe you ?
why should i believe a word you say to me ? !
well , this must &apos;ve been a nightmare for you ,
me showing up here like this .
don &apos;t worry -- it has been worse for me .
good night , dr. webber .
surgeons are bred to be invulnerable .
it &apos;s very hard to lay ourselves bare .
hey . how are you feeling ?
hey . uh , not great . weird day .
you don &apos;t have a fever . you still sick ?
no , i @-@ i wasn &apos;t sick .
i @-@ i &apos;m -- i am a little drunk , though .
you &apos;re drunk ?
yes . i was at alex &apos;s --
okay , meredith , you got to help me .
i @-@ i @-@ i @-@ i &apos;m trying to understand .
okay , listen , this crazy thing is happening --
you said you had to stay here
to make the most of your career .
just listen to me .
wait -- so , i gave up the brain mapping initiative
so you can play hooky and get drunk with your friends ?
this is why we &apos;re staying in seattle ?
because we know exactly how deep some injuries can go .
but vulnerability isn &apos;t the opposite of strength .
it &apos;s a necessary part .
we have to force ourselves to open up ...
... to expose ourselves ...
... to offer up everything we have ...
... and just pray that it &apos;s good enough .
i &apos;m sure you did fine .
sure are taking a long time .
alex ?
otherwise ... we &apos;ll never succeed .
congratulations .
i -- wait . karev ?
bailey ?
wha--
hey ! there she is .
hey . congratulations .
oh , my ...
