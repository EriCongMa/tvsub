here you guys go . some cookies . wow .
okay , great .
um , as you guys know , i &apos;m moving in with caroline ,
and i &apos;m glad we can talk about this like adults .
caroline is , uh , quite the baker .
anything else , anyone ?
you &apos;re making a huge , life @-@ ruining mistake by moving in
with a woman who turned you into an agoraphobic ,
turtle @-@ faced , borderline alcoholic .
i &apos;m going to start over ,
&apos;cause this did not go the way i had planned .
as you guys know , i &apos;m leaving ,
so there are some things we need to work out .
yeah , like , what am i going to do with all that extra money
i have now that i don &apos;t have to cover for you anymore ?
okay .
maybe i &apos;ll buy a city .
oh , and you can open a mall
and call it winston &apos;s corners .
what are you guys doing ?
you &apos;re just sitting here and letting this happen ?
what else are we going to do ?
the guy obviously knows what he wants .
i do .
when nick leaves ,
i &apos;m going to call a plumber
and just throw cash at him while he works .
fitties and hunnits , hunnits , hunnits .
look , while you &apos;re at it , can you please call an exterminator
so we can get rid of that crime against nature ?
yeah , he &apos;s not fooling anyone .
you think , just &apos; cause he &apos;s a snappy dresser ,
the mice don &apos;t see the hammer ?
mice come from all over the building
to laugh at that dummy witch .
is this a freaking carob chip ?
what , are you trying to buy our love with hippie chocolate ?
you idiot .
aren &apos;t you going to miss this , nick ?
winston , can you take me to the doctor tomorrow ?
he &apos;s taking the bandages off .
the old washington monument .
ready to serve this great nation once again .
can you stop ?
what ?
it &apos;s time to make this horse into a unicorn .
can we save this talk until after we &apos;re done
interviewing neil here to take nick &apos;s room ?
hey , don &apos;t worry about me .
i could talk about my dingus all night long .
neil , tell us about yourself-
you know , uh , anything we should know ,
aside from the fact
that you responded to our craigslist ad with a fax ?
well , um , yeah , my name is neil .
um , just coming out of a pretty hairy divorce .
i am in human resources .
well , i used to be .
i had the unique , uh , experience of having to let myself go .
i did not take it well .
let me ask you a question .
i would love for you to save your questions till the end .
are you going to be a wuss about things
like crabs and bedbugs ?
like , crabs from maine ?
i hope you like feminist rants ,
&apos;cause that &apos;s kind of my thing .
neil , she &apos;s just saying this to scare you .
what are you ...
what are you doing ?
shut up .
i &apos;m a cutter .
neil , uh , i want you to give us a minute , okay ?
i got to go talk to my roommates in the bathroom . guys ?
okay . yeah .
you &apos;re acting insane .
i &apos;m acting insane ? that guy &apos;s insane .
look , jess , when you moved in , we all had to roll with it .
to be fair , you do some pretty weird stuff .
you know , i still can &apos;t get used to the way
you let us know when you &apos;re using the toilet .
i &apos;m good with neil .
i am , too .
what are you guys doing ?
nick &apos;s leaving .
you &apos;re his friends .
aren &apos;t you going to fight for him to stay ?
you &apos;re in .
ah , yes ! okay .
and get ready for songs ,
&apos;cause i am kind of a troubadour .
this is happening , nick . this is happening .
whoa , whoa ! why you taking back your lamp ?
i think you just answered that when you called it my lamp .
no , man . squatters &apos; rights .
what &apos;s wrong ? you still afraid of the dark ?
what ? no . dude .
&apos;cause , if you are ,
i &apos;ll leave this behind .
nick , first of all , i &apos;m not afraid of the dark .
but if i were afraid of the dark ,
that would be a totally rational , adaptive evolutionary response .
good night , winston .
that &apos;s ridiculous .
i &apos;m not afraid of the dark .
good night , sweetheart .
unless the monsters get you .
you came .
what you got in there ?
it &apos;s a hard cast .
yeah , things didn &apos;t go quite like we had hoped at the doctor .
yeah , so i told the guy
i had never been snowmobiling in my life , you know , and ...
oh , god !
that &apos;s not my penis .
but look , on the bright side ,
it is impossible for me to get aroused in this thing .
here , watch-- say something hot to me .
fresh @-@ pressed linens .
nope , nothing .
not an inch .
like a swaddled baby .
hey , cece .
they &apos;re ready for us .
oh , okay .
just hang out , okay ? have fun .
that &apos;s right . ride that missile .
grip it . yeah .
you &apos;ve got a whole tank full of jet fuel .
you &apos;re heading straight for the sun .
what the hell war is this ?
all right , turn around and face him .
am @-@ am i ...
am i supposed to want to buy a missile ?
i don &apos;t understand .
just pounding the drum of war .
what @-@ what , did no one listen to eisenhower ?
all right , so that &apos;s everything .
i took my fair share of rubber bands ,
so i don &apos;t want to hear about it .
in my room , you will find a shoe box .
in that box , there is a guinea pig
that i said i would bury ,
so please deal with it .
there &apos;s a corpse in your room ?
all right , guys , well , thanks for helping me move .
what are we standing in a circle for ,
like a bunch of weirdos ? let &apos;s go .
hey , nick ?

thanks for helping me move .
i love the way he smelled .
caroline and i are starting a whole new life together .
right now , we &apos;re trying to decide
between eggshell and soft mint for the walls .
my gut says that eggshell is trying too hard ,
but soft mint is really tricky to match .
have i told you guys about the bay windows i &apos;m going to have ?
yes , you have .
yeah , you just did .
they are stunning , right ?
i &apos;m going to curl up in those like a damn cat .
