who took me to a rave , and i got to wear a tube top ,
and i stuffed cash in a caged go @-@ go boy &apos;s speedo ?
we &apos;re still party people .
oh , joanne , before i forget , can i get a punch ?

if that was your gay card , it would be revoked .
okay , you know what , claire ?
you &apos;re being a little high school you .
i am sorry , mitchell , but i get one free night ,
and i can &apos;t spend it at a place
that is a proud supporter of wilson elementary .
we all need to give back , claire .

but thank you anyway .
no problem . well , it was nice meeting you .

i was a little nervous
you wouldn &apos;t see what &apos;s so special about this place .

you &apos;re gonna make your own decisions .
you wanna go with them , don &apos;t you ?
no , we &apos;re doing our thing .

okay , i don &apos;t know about you ,
but i got about five minutes of fabulous left in me .
yeah , in my mind , i &apos;m already in our kitchen .
i &apos;m watching my potpie rotate in the microwave .
okay . okay . when did hats come back ?
that one &apos;s come back about eight times .
pick a side of the room , lady .
all right , there &apos;s , like ,
a thousand people waiting for wine .
i wanna try on a couple of dresses ,
and then julian here &apos;s gonna take us to a club across town .
i think we &apos;re gonna go home .
what ? why ? it &apos;s 9 : 30 .
it &apos;s 9 : 30 ?
when did you two become such old women ?
first , you take me to that senior center for porridge ,
and now you can &apos;t even stay up past luke &apos;s bedtime ?
it &apos;s friday . we get tired on fridays .
we get very tired .
i have 3 children . i &apos;ve been tired since 2005 .
let &apos;s rally . you &apos;re my ride .
if you want to stay out , i can take you home .
really ?
of course .
okay . all right , girls , go home ,
roll up your hair , clap out the lights ,
&apos;cause this guy , who i just met ,
is gonna show me a good time .
okay , well , if he was straight ,
this would be just like high school .
this is ridiculous .
she &apos;s obviously got a pistol under that poncho .
how do you watch this stuff ?
he &apos;s been up there for more than one hour .
i can &apos;t stand this .
who &apos;s been up there ?
ronaldo &apos;s doing the dishes right in front of her .
manny , in his bedroom .
gloria , are you even watching this ?
i &apos;m doing this for you .
what does he has in that box that he cannot show to me ?
little boys are supposed to keep secrets from their mothers .
wait . the judge just peeked through the window .
is he interested in celia now ?
she could be his daughter .
i bet it &apos;s a birthday gift for me .
yeah , that sounds right . what &apos;s he saying ?
i &apos;ve never seen him this mad .
wait a minute .
i already found my birthday gift underneath his bed .
it &apos;s a giant hat .
when did hats came back anyway ?
now she &apos;s reaching under the poncho .
like she &apos;s gonna shoot ronaldo .
he &apos;s the main character , right ?
that &apos;s it . i &apos;m going up there .
wait , gloria . no . don &apos;t go .
why not ?
think about it .
13 @-@ year @-@ old boy , talks about girls all day long .
we have more security on these computers than the pentagon .
what do you think he &apos;s doing up there ... alone ?
do you think he ordered some movies ?
movies , magazines , whatever the hell .
how dare do you say that , jay ? !
he &apos;s a little boy ! he &apos;s just a boy .
i don &apos;t want to talk to you . i &apos;m gonna take a walk .
gloria , come on .
come back . i know you &apos;re not mad at me .
you just ...
oh ! what &apos;d she do ?
ronaldo !
wang chung !
pay up , gentlemen !
yes !
thank you !
really ? that &apos;s so nice .
another pitcher , my good woman .
claire would have killed me if she &apos;d known
that i let haley go off alone
while i chilled in a bar with some undergrads ,
but i happen to trust my daughter .
also , i was tracking her location with the gps on her phone .
fellas , cedar and los alamos . that &apos;s , uh ...
pi chi house ?
pi chi ?
oh , come on . why is my bluetooth not working ?
oh , god . it &apos;s longinus . he &apos;s gonna be so mad at us .
hey , longe . don &apos;t be mad at us for leaving .
i went back to our spot , and everybody was gone .
who does that to a sister ? !
we &apos;re sorry , but the sitter called ,
and , uh , lily was running a fever .
so ... we feel even worse
about dumping claire on you and your hot date .
who is gorgeous , by the way . seems super funny , too .
perfect for you .
please , i wish that was a date .
he &apos;s my trainer , and he &apos;s straight .
what ? julian &apos;s straight . oh , i love it
when a straight person and a gay person go out together .
i &apos;d love it a lot more if he was gay .
oh , my god . this isn &apos;t our car .
what ?
this isn &apos;t our prius !
they--they must &apos;ve given us the wrong one at the valet .
that &apos;s why the bluetooth isn &apos;t working .
we stole a car ? are you serious ?
what &apos;s happening ?
oh , we stole a car . uh , we gotta go .
okay , we did not steal a car , cam . it was given to us .
why are you giving me attitude ? you &apos;re the one that stole a car .
how is this a stolen car ? ! how ? !
i don &apos;t know ! i &apos;m confused !
do you have an aspirin ?
this isn &apos;t my car !
hey , lukie . hi . what &apos;s going on ?
oh , i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;ll check .
i have it .
well , i could bring it by
and meet you outside in 20 minutes ?
no , sw--out--out-- outside , sweetie .
okay . bye @-@ bye .
do you mind swinging by my kid &apos;s sleepover ?
i gotta give him this retainer .
it &apos;s on the way to the club .
sure , no problem .
oh ! you are so sweet .
holy pythons , batman . do you ever leave the gym ?
uh , no . actually , i &apos;m a trainer and a masseur .
oh , my god .
i &apos;m gonna have to try out that second one .
zip , please .
i gotta say ,
this night is turning out to be a lot more fun than i expected .
i &apos;ve got two kids at sleepovers
and one upstate with daddy .
the fun is just beginning .
unbelievable .
the valet gave our car away to someone , like ,
an hour and a half ago .
you know what that means .
our potpies could be anywhere by now .
they probably went home . if--if we knew their address ,
maybe we could see if our car was there .
oh , yeah . and how do you propose we do that ?
calculating route home .
yeah .
oh , you &apos;re good . mm .
oh , and look . only .6 miles away .
prepare to turn right in 500 feet .
notice how she didn &apos;t wait
until after the turn to tell me , cam ?
really ? this ? now ?
i &apos;m just ...
oh , look . they went to see jay @-@ z.
we almost went to see jay @-@ z , didn &apos;t we ?
no , no , no , &apos; cause remember it started at 8 : 30 .
oh , yeah ,
which meant he wouldn &apos;t have gone on until 10 : 00 .
and then that parking nightmare .
oh , and those stairs .
okay , i &apos;m hearing it now .
is claire right ? are we in a rut ?
well , we might be , especially compared to these people .
look at this . cancun luggage tickets .
a parking pass to yosemite .
a triathlon bib . this is living .
no , but you know what ? we have lily , okay ?
i know .
you can &apos;t do that with a child .
they have a car seat .
okay , fine , we &apos;re in a rut .
destination ahead in 900 feet .
you know , maybe we just need to be around
more stimulating people .
well , we &apos;re gonna be in about 900 feet .
it &apos;s not the craziest idea . they seem like fun people .
yeah , and maybe we can be new couples friends with them .
yeah .
you know , we can go out to concerts ,
try exciting new food , maybe do some luxury camping .
yeah , hitch our wagon to their star
and see how fast they spice up our life .
you have arrived .
i believe we have .
you dumb son of a bitch !
oh , my god .
oh , my god ! oh , my god !
oh , my god ! oh , my god . what &apos;s happening ? !
i can &apos;t believe you came back here , you filthy , cheating pig !
where is she ? where is she ? !
back up , i said !
i &apos;m trying ! we are in a rut !
really ? you wanna talk about that right now ?
no , we are stuck ! we &apos;re in an actual rut . we &apos;re stuck .
ohh ! oh , my god . oh , my god !
we are victims of a hate crime right now !
go ! go !
oh , my god !
oh , no , you don &apos;t .
dad , what are you doing here ?
what &apos;s this , buddy .
ginger ale .
oh , really ? &apos; cause is smells-- okay , it smells like ginger ale .
but that doesn &apos;t prove anything .
what the hell ?
we are leaving .
i &apos;m having a nice time with--
with this clown ? and by the way , it &apos;s a little cliche
to pick someone who looks exactly like your dad .
i got your number , pi chi .
i know you .
yeah , you do .
this is ben ford . he &apos;s in my class .
he &apos;s visiting , too .
you were my t @-@ ball coach .
my dad &apos;s your doctor . he &apos;s right over there .
what is wrong with you ?
are you trying to ruin college for me before i even get here ?
no , i @-@ i &apos;m not .
i am so sorry . you are not a clown .
you were an excellent backup shortstop .
alecia . bruce .
go , bullfrogs-- dogs !
go , bulldogs .
claire !
wow . really ?
no , it &apos;s just a shock , is all .
jay ?
so celia &apos;s carrying the judge &apos;s baby .
no wonder she shot him . she &apos;s hormonal .
who are you talking to ?
the housekeeper .
maria , i &apos;ve gotta go . thanks a lot .
jay , i need you to talk to manny .
what ?
well , if he &apos;s doing what you think he &apos;s doing ,
then he needs to talk to a man .
i don &apos;t want him to be ashame of anything .
then you don &apos;t want to send me in there .
yeah , but what if-- if he has questions ?
what if he doesn &apos;t know how to--
gloria , gloria , whatever he &apos;s going through ,
he can work it out himself .
help ! i &apos;m stuck !
ay , no , jay , go . i beg of you !
go ! go ! go !
gloria .
i &apos;m extremely reluctant to do this .
please hurry !
ay , no . i cannot look at this .
what the hell ?
i can &apos;t get down , jay .
what ? what happened to manny ? !
ay , somebody say something to me !
gloria ,
it &apos;s okay .
come on in .
okay .
he was hanging from that bar up there .
what ? why ? what do you have on your head ?
it &apos;s a weighted helmet to stretch me so i can get taller .
manny ! why do you have to get tall now ?
love , mom . why else ?
i lost bella to durkus because ,
in her words , &quot; he &apos;s tall . &quot;
everybody else is getting taller but me .
you think it &apos;s the coffee ?
no .
maybe . but--
but hanging downside up is not gonna help you .
the web site said it would .
listen , manny ,
you &apos;re already intelligent and beautiful and funny .
if you get tall , you &apos;re going to have everything ,
and those poor boys
are not gonna have anything to compete with you .
look at this .
you have a mark on your head now .
i &apos;m gonna go get you some ice , okay ?
that &apos;s a lot of pretty words , but they don &apos;t help me tomorrow .
sorry , kid . it &apos;s just one of those things .
you get taller when you get taller .
why don &apos;t you get ready for bed ?
ah , jeez .
you know , when i was your age ,
i started working out to get the girls .
you think that would help ?
yeah . so tomorrow , we start working out .
okay ?
maybe i &apos;ll even show you a few pull @-@ ups
on , uh , this bad boy here , huh ?
you see that ?
pretty soon , that &apos;s how strong ... you &apos;re gonna be .
thanks , mom .
shh !
i don &apos;t want them to know i was here .
okay .
oh , claire , i thought that was you .
thank god . come in .
i can &apos;t . &apos; cause i &apos;m sick , remember ? sorry .
well , my dvd player just broke ,
and none of us know how &quot; gone with the wind &quot; ends .
but you saw it , right ?
oh , is that claire ?
yeah .
can you tell us what happened ?
i could , but i don &apos;t want to ruin it for you .
no , we really need to know . we need to know .
claire . just tell us . -um ...
scarlett is ... really mad at clark gable
because , um , he says so many bad things .
and didn &apos;t he , um , burn down a farm or something ?
claire , have you been drinking ?
i had a hot toddy . made one for my throat .
pretty dressed up for a night in bed , right ?
yeah , i @-@ i just threw on the first thing i could find ...
when luke called , and it was just right there on the chair .
she has a stamp on her hand .
okay . all right .
before we bust out the pitchforks and the torches ,
may i remind you
that i &apos;ve driven every one of your children home
and heimliched at least one , bethenny .
hi .
hello .
this is totally inappropriate . but could i use your bathroom ?
sorry . you kept pushing the drinks .
i--friend . gay friend . gay .
i @-@ i &apos;m not gay .
yes , you are .
i @-@ i &apos;m not gay . i &apos;m--i &apos;m french .
you thought i was gay ?
are you serious right now ?
well , are you ?
you &apos;ve been throwing yourself at me all night .
no , no . no , i have not .
bethenny , grab the pinot .
bethenny , do not grab the pinot .
you undressed in front of me . you squeezed my arm .
you asked me for a massage . what was all that ?
that was--that was me safely objectifying a gay person .
wow , claire !
when i wrote &quot; don &apos;t ever change &quot; in your yearbook ,
i didn &apos;t mean it like this .
oh , ease up , holly .
okay , i lied .
i lied , but i get one night to myself ,
and i just wanted to spend it with some fun gay people .
it &apos;s not my fault this one decided to be straight .
i &apos;ve always been straight .
oh , you don &apos;t get to talk !
i took fashion advice from you !
oh , my god . do i even look good in this dress ?
no . not you .
it &apos;s really short , isn &apos;t it ?
it &apos;s short .
yeah .
please ?
please , just listen to me for one second .
go away ! stop following me !
hey , you wanna tell me why you &apos;re bothering this young lady ?
oh , no , no , no , no . officer , this is my daughter . tell him .
tonight , i don &apos;t know who you are .
she &apos;s ... she &apos;s joking .
i &apos;m not dangerous .
in fact , i @-@ i @-@ i helped to put all the lights on this path .
20 years ago ,
some friends and i took back the night . so ...
i @-@ i think i just ...
i embarrassed her a little .
&quot; a little &quot; ?
that sweatshirt embarrasses me &quot; a little . &quot;
yep , that &apos;s a daughter .
tonight was insane .
why did you have to act like that ?
you were at that party .
i see you talking to frat boys , and--
isn &apos;t that why we &apos;re here , so i can experience college ?
i mean , what are you gonna do when i actually go ?
i don &apos;t know . freak out , i think .
look ...
your whole life , my job has been to protect you--
a job i kinda love .
now i feel like i &apos;m being forced into early retirement .
i just needed to find you and make sure you were okay ...
for as long as i still get to do that .
just like you--
piss me off and then say something sweet .
i &apos;m not leaving until the fall .
maybe by then i can figure out
how to put a force field around you .
i &apos;ve been working on that one
since the first time i tried to fasten you into your car seat .
i pinched your chunky little thigh .
even though you basically just called me fat .
so ...
is it really fun ?
what ?
no !
we all struggle with limitations ...
some we &apos;re willing to accept ...
you know , i just wanna be home ,
reading on opposite ends of the sofa .
and some we &apos;re not .
i &apos;m so embarrassed i did that .
i &apos;m just so happy that that was all it was .
why ? what &apos;d you think i was doing ?
it &apos;s never too late to grow in life .
oh , my god !
&quot; thanks to our patented lengthenator ,
you can increase your height by up to 4 inches . &quot;
i can &apos;t believe he would spend $ 50 on this thing .
i know .
he could &apos;ve got a 2 @-@ year subscription to &quot; playboy &quot; for that .
he &apos;s not getting the &quot; playboy &quot; ever ! ow !
he &apos;s a little boy !
wouldn &apos;t it be great if we woke up tomorrow
and our car had found its way home ?
yeah , i feel that &apos;s not the way it &apos;s gonna happen .
happened on the farm one time .
a tornado scooped up one of our calves ,
dropped it who knows where . six months later ,
a full @-@ grown cow comes walking up the driveway--
same markings , same moo .
that night , we--
we ate like kings .
okay , i &apos;ve told it before .
oh , my gosh ! it &apos;s our car !
