in therapy , the subject was tom &apos;s new girlfriend .
what about sex ?
not yet .
i ... he wants to end the marriage .
susan wanted to quit ...
maybe i &apos;m not a real artist .
this class has been really good for you .
but decided to face the challenge instead .
you &apos;re hiding something ,
and i &apos;m gonna pull it out of you .
there is a chance that you might actually become an artist .
carlos tried to drown his guilt ...
carlos !
hey , gaby .
and ben showed bree the site where construction
was about to begin .
have you ever been here before ?
once .
paranoia ...
it &apos;s the irrational fear that someone is after you ...
that you &apos;re going to be exposed at any moment .
paranoia can sneak up on you ...
causing you to stumble at every turn .
and just when you think you &apos;re in the clear ...
and the danger has passed ...
paranoia reminds you ...
gaby ?
lynette ?
that no place is truly safe .
oh , my god .
where &apos;d he go ? is he gone ?
for now , but we gotta hurry .
i think we &apos;re close . i recognize this area .
god , this is creeping me out .
well , it doesn &apos;t help that it &apos;s halloween .
let &apos;s just dig him up and get this over with .
ladies ?
ladies !
bree ?
bree ?
honey ? are you okay ?
paranoia--
it &apos;s the irrational fear that someone is after you .
but even when you hope it isn &apos;t real ,
it can still scare you to death .
no !
susan delfino had always been a great student .
that &apos;s because she knew how to be the teacher &apos;s pet .
some liked gifts .
some liked extra credit .
and some just liked her .
but in her new class ,
susan would learn that not every teacher ...
happy halloween .
was in the market for a pet .
i thought you might like a little treat
complete with candy corn .
who doesn &apos;t like candy corn ?
apparently you .
it appears some of you have remembered
today is the day i select my intern .
oh , is that today ?
i have a commission due tuesday ,
and i need all the help i can get this weekend .
now this is obviously a prestigious honor .
that goes without saying .
and it won &apos;t be awarded based on brownnosing ,
bootlicking or cupcake making .
that about covers all your moves .
my decision will be made solely on talent ,
experience , and who irritates me the least .
oh , crap .
and that &apos;s why--stand up , amy .
i &apos;ve chosen ...
susan delfino .
sit down , amy .
that was fun .
me ?
meet me at 5 : 00 tomorrow . we &apos;ll discuss your duties .
thank you so much . i @-@ i &apos;m so grateful .
but could we make it 5 : 15 ?
my son has soccer practice--
i have no kids .
and he &apos;s not very good so he won &apos;t be going .
see you at 5 : 00 .
hey , babe . how you doing ?
fine .
good .
great .
glad to hear it .
would you like your own cup ?
sorry .
just ...
that night really scared the hell out of me .
scared me , too .
yeah , but you haven &apos;t done anything about it .
i thought you were gonna check out an a.a. meeting .
gaby , i &apos;m not an alcoholic .
tell that to the cab driver who helped me
carry you inside the house .
fine . if it will keep
your fingers out of my coffee ,
i &apos;ll go to a meeting .
thank you .
i love you .
we &apos;re gonna get through this , okay ?
oh ! and do me a favor .
if it turns out you are an alcoholic ,
promise you won &apos;t be one of those whiny ones .
okay , we gotta talk .
oh , god , he brought jane ?
hey , sweetie . how was your dad &apos;s ?
it was fun .
good .
look . it &apos;s my halloween costume .
i &apos;m gonna be a swan .
right . how about you be something
mommy can actually make , like a ghost
or a 13 @-@ year @-@ old american teenager ?
you don &apos;t have to make it . jane said she would .
of course she did .
well , i should go thank her for helping me to parent you .
jane , it &apos;s okay . you don &apos;t have to stay in the car .
or maybe you should .
i mean , i don &apos;t wanna show you up with my fancy sweats .
oh , stop . you look great .
look , i think it &apos;s sweet that you volunteered
to help penny make her costume .
hey , i hope i didn &apos;t overstep .
you know , it &apos;s just , before medical school ,
i dabbled a bit in fashion design .
of course you did .
it &apos;s nothing .
couple of semesters in paris .
ah , paris . c &apos;est la plus belle ville du monde , no ?
oui . oui , oui . yes .
she &apos;s-- she &apos;s teaching me .
of course she is .
anyway , making penny &apos;s halloween costume
is sort of a ... mother / daughter tradition .
since when ?
since always .
actually , i started it already , and i don &apos;t want to oversell ,
but it &apos;s gonna be pretty great .
i &apos;m sorry . she didn &apos;t say anything .
i &apos;m sure she didn &apos;t want to hurt your feelings .
well , if you change your mind , it &apos;s really no trouble .
i &apos;ve already made a bunch of costumes
for the kids in the cancer ward .
of course she did .
oh , god . you &apos;re closing the curtains .
this can &apos;t be good .
it isn &apos;t . i just heard the details
of ben &apos;s latest real estate project .
mom !
oh , honey , not right now .
we &apos;re talking .
you told me to try on my costume .
you said you &apos;d fix the yolk .
oh , this is will take two seconds .
celia &apos;s going as bacon .
this works a lot better when we &apos;re together .
so what were you guys talking about ?
um , i was just telling your mother
a very scary halloween story about these four witches
who buried a monster deep in the woods .
cool .
and after they buried the monster ,
they went on with their lives
until this big , frightening real estate developer came along
and decided to build condos
right where the monster was buried !
oh ! sorry , sorry .
are you sure ?
yeah . witches always lie .
not this witch .
well , i think one of those witches
better go see what she can do to kill the project .
how ? !
i don &apos;t know . it &apos;s your story .
fine .
yeah . that actually was kind of a lame story .
it wasn &apos;t even scary .
trust me , honey . it is really , really scary .
sorry i &apos;ve been a.w.o.l. for the past two weeks ,
but , uh , that &apos;s only &apos; cause i--
i &apos;m sorry . have we met ?
ben , is it ?
i know , i know . i ...
i &apos;ve been swamped getting my new project under way .
but i wanna make it up to you .
how ?
tomorrow night , my place , dinner for two ,
cooked by one .
tomorrow &apos;s halloween .
so ? it &apos;ll be fun .
we can , uh , pass out candy to trick @-@ or @-@ treaters .
and then maybe later ,
we can ... trick a little ... treat of our ...
i don &apos;t know where i was going with that .
all right , you want a date with me ?
yeah .
beg .
excuse me ?
on your knees , soldier .
renee , dear , sweet , horrible girl ,
would you do me the honor of dining with me
on tomorrow ?
i would .
was that really necessary ?
it was for me .
i had to make sure i wasn &apos;t rolling over
for a guy with a bald spot .
intern susan delfino reporting for duty , sir .
i was wondering how long it might take me to regret this .
wait . i just want to say how honored i am
that you chose me .
it &apos;s nice to know that when the history of art is written ,
there &apos;ll be one small footnote with my name on it .
susan , jasper , jasper , susan .
i &apos;ll pick him up monday night .
i don &apos;t understand .
well , he &apos;s my son .
you &apos;re watching him for the weekend .
my ex says he &apos;s deathly allergic to tree nuts , cats ...
and something else . i can &apos;t remember .
uh , wait a-- wait a minute .
so ... you have a son ? somebody married you ?
briefly . i was young and needed money .
she was rich and wanted a child ,
and now one weekend a month ,
jasper and i spend some quality time together .
see you monday .
uh , wait a minute . um , so ...
that &apos;s what this is .
i &apos;m just a ... glorified babysitter .
no , no , no , no .
as per school policy , we &apos;re calling it an internship .
that way , i don &apos;t have to pay you .
so , jasper , looks like it &apos;s just you and me .
what are you reading ?
&quot; tips for surviving a nuclear attack . &quot;
the people of nagasaki never saw it coming .
i know how they feel .
so ben and i are having sex tomorrow .
ew . not in front of my kid &apos;s costume .
sorry . it &apos;s our first time . it &apos;s kind of a big deal .
first time ? i thought sex was like shaking hands for you .
it is . i like to get it over with early .
so there &apos;s no pressure .
but with ben , there &apos;s been all this buildup , so ...
pressure ?
yeah .
i like him ... a lot .
and i want our first time to be great .
that &apos;s sweet .
that &apos;s why i got some sex drugs in chinatown .
less sweet .
&quot; woman love fluid . &quot;
i gotta put some tape over that .
this stuff work ?
even if it all it jacks up is my confidence ,
that is good enough for me .
okay . what do you think ?
this looks like a cat , right ?
sure , after it &apos;s passed through a coyote .
what is going on ?
you always go for easy costumes .
didn &apos;t you once staple math tests
to penny &apos;s jeans
and send her out as &quot; smarty pants &quot; ?
yes , but this year , tom &apos;s new girlfriend
offered to make penny &apos;s costume ,
so i , of course , said i would .
damn , why is there no chinese costume fluid ?
well , you &apos;re in luck .
i have a friend in new york that is a costume designer ,
and he has three tony awards .
and he &apos;ll make my kid &apos;s cat outfit ?
sadly , he &apos;ll do anything for cash .
he &apos;s a huge cokehead .
that means he &apos;ll do it fast , too . that &apos;s great !
i @-@ i mean , for us .
poor guy needs help .
my thoughts and prayers are with him .
hey there .
if you &apos;re , uh , here for the meeting , it just ended ,
as i &apos;m sure you can tell by the massacre
at the doughnut box .
actually , i was just ...
really looking to talk to somebody .
well , i &apos;m allen .
carlos .
why don &apos;t you tell me what &apos;s going on with you , carlos ?
come on in .
okay . all right .
i , uh ... had a little incident
a few nights ago .
got loaded ... and i left the house ,
and , uh ... i don &apos;t remember doing it .
uh @-@ huh , you blacked out , huh ?
yeah , i &apos;m so jealous of you guys .
uh , i was always cursed with total recall
of every horrifying second of my benders .
so how often does this happen ?
it doesn &apos;t .
i usually don &apos;t drink that much . just lately .
yeah ? oh . so what &apos;s &quot; lately &quot; ?
i don &apos;t know .
two months , maybe .
something happen two months ago ?
you lose your job ?
did your wife leave you ? dog die ?
no .
nothing i can think of .
&apos;cause usually this sort of thing is triggered
by some kind of traumatic incident .
you know , i don &apos;t think this was such a good idea .
hey , i wasn &apos;t trying to pry .
allen , thanks , but i really gotta be going .
was good meeting you , carlos .
listen , if , uh ,
you ever wanna talk , here &apos;s my cell .
day or night , i &apos;ll pick up .
appreciate it .
good luck to you .
bree .
what ? is everything all right ?
i just saw some miscreants throwing eggs at your house .
i tried to run over and catch them ,
but i was too late .
ah , it &apos;s probably some kids warming up for halloween .
no , no , it wasn &apos;t kids , and they shouted something
unpleasant about real estate developers ,
including an anti @-@ australian slur .
uh , i &apos;ve never heard an anti @-@ australian slur .
what was it ?
i &apos;d rather not repeat it .
the point is , there seems to be some strenuous opposition
to the chapman woods development ,
and as your liaison ,
i think you should consider relocating it .
all right .
let me consider it .
nah . screw &apos; em .
excuse me ?
i already sunk $ 100,000 into moving this project
from hawkins lake ,
and there &apos;s no way i &apos;m doing it again .
well ... what happened at hawkins lake ?
we were all set to go , bulldozers at the ready ,
and then the environmental impact study
turns up five endangered yellow @-@ spotted frogs .
frogs ?
yeah . the slimy little bastards are now the proud owners
of 50 acres of waterfront real estate .
i &apos;m just curious . have you had your environmental impact study
in chapman woods yet ?
uh , tomorrow , but i &apos;m not worried .
my guys have been over every inch of it .
not a miserable amphibian in sight .
yes .
and i can &apos;t imagine that would change overnight .
they &apos;d actually stop a construction project for a frog ?
if it &apos;s an endangered yellow @-@ spotted frog , they will .
now come on . help me find some .
ugh . things creep me out .
you know that story
where the princess has to kiss the frog ,
turn him back into a prince ? so not worth it .
i don &apos;t care how rich his dad was .
gaby , you know where they don &apos;t have frogs ?
prison ! which is where we &apos;re gonna be
if we don &apos;t plant some at ben &apos;s construction site .
fine . i &apos;ll help .
oh . saw one . ohh !
oh , is that one ?
does he have spots on his legs ?
he has to have spots on his legs .
well , you &apos;re good with crafts . you can stencil some on later .
damn it !
this is more of a boys thing . why isn &apos;t carlos here ?
because i didn &apos;t tell him about the construction .
what ? why not ?
because he &apos;s got a lot on his plate right now .
or , actually , in his glass .
he &apos;s been drinking a lot .
really ? do you want me to speak to him ?
no . no . he &apos;s been going to a.a. meetings .
he said he met a great sponsor . he &apos;s doing fine .
i certainly understand what he &apos;s going through .
it &apos;s kind of a miracle
that i &apos;ve stayed sober through all of this .
don &apos;t move . there &apos;s one by your foot .
this is gonna be a long day .
so ... you wanna play some video games ?
that &apos;s original .
okay . um ...
something more creative .
you wanna carve a jack @-@ o &apos; -lantern ?
i &apos;d rather stick a knife in my eye .
only 36 hours to go .
37 . he &apos;s always late .
i am the candy @-@ bot 3000 .
please give candy .
aw , m.j. , you look amazing . i mean ...
i am mom @-@ bot 3000 .
costume approved .
you guys sound stupid .
your insult does not compute .
shut up ! nobody cares about being a dumb robot !
hey , what &apos;s going on ?
i just hate all this halloween stuff .
how can you hate a holiday that &apos;s all about dressing up
and getting free candy ?
it &apos;s the best day of the year .
jasper , does your dad not let you celebrate halloween ?
he says it &apos;s for kids .
you do know you &apos;re a kid , right ?
okay , that &apos;s it .
you and your father are coming
trick @-@ or @-@ treating with us .
he &apos;ll never go for that .
oh , you just let me talk to him .
i can be pretty persuasive .
i &apos;d rather stick a knife in my eye .
oh , come on . your son is dying to go trick @-@ or @-@ treating .
it &apos;s just a couple hours .
until i deliver these paintings ,
it &apos;s the only thing i care about .
that and a cigarette .
don &apos;t look at this . it &apos;s not done .
gaby , will you stop with the sanitizer ?
your hands are gonna slide right off the wheel .
i can &apos;t help it .
i can still feel those slimy things
crawling through my fingers .
speaking of which ,
how come i don &apos;t hear anything moving in that box ?
shouldn &apos;t they be croaking or something ?
maybe they &apos;re resting .
or dead .
you don &apos;t think they &apos;re dead , do you ?
oh , god ! don &apos;t bring that in the front seat .
i don &apos;t hear anything .
all right . i &apos;m trying to remain calm .
please tell me those are your long @-@ webbed fingers
on my arm .
gaby , do not panic .
aah ! get it off !
stay calm ! stay calm !
don &apos;t panic !
watch the road !
oh , god ! i think it &apos;s on my leg !
stop swerving !
i &apos;m trying to get the lid back on !
get it off me !
careful ! it &apos;s crawling under the brake pedal !
not anymore !
oh , they &apos;re getting away ! they &apos;re so fast !
what the hell could endanger them ? !
ohh ! detailing is never gonna get that out !
we &apos;re so screwed .
will you please stop saying that ?
in 12 hours , those bulldozers are gonna break ground .
i think the phrase &quot; we are so screwed &quot;
cannot be said enough .
there must be something we can do .
they &apos;re gonna find alejandro &apos;s body .
they &apos;ll--they &apos;ll do an investigation .
they &apos;ll learn he &apos;s my stepfather .
unless ...
unless what ?
there &apos;s no body to be found .
mom , i need my cat costume .
dad and jane will be here soon .
i &apos;m just putting on the finishing touches .
the tracking number is jhkwrxa .
i &apos;m not sure why the tracking numbers are all letters ,
but it &apos;s your system , so--
oh , forget it , forget it . there he is .
up here ! up here ! don &apos;t--don &apos;t ring the doorbell .
i just put my baby down for a nap .
toss the package up here .
i &apos;ll catch it . i have three sons . come on !
nice .
i can &apos;t wait any longer . let me see .
finished . all yours .
thanks , mom .
i can &apos;t believe you made this all by yourself .
mrs. scavo ! i need a signature !
let &apos;s go try it on . come on .
okay .
go , go .
i &apos;m just saying you are one good wig
away from being a fantastic cowardly lion .
drop it , witch .
just say it for me once .
&quot; i do believe in spooks .
i do , i do , i do believe in spooks . &quot;
look , i &apos;m only here because you kidnapped my painting .
the ransom was two hours of trick @-@ or @-@ treating ,
no costume , no chitchat .
all i &apos;m doing is counting the minutes
till i can get back to work .
score . check it out .
they had giant peanut butter cups .
nice going , sweetie .
i got a chocolate bomb . you want some ?
no , thanks , pal . what i want is to go .
but we &apos;ve only done half the street .
okay , well , tell you what .
what if we leave now , and i &apos;ll give you 20 bucks ?
you can buy all the candy you like .
your father &apos;s just messing with you . run on ahead .
i promise i &apos;ll go fast , andre .
he calls you &quot; andre &quot; ?
oh , yeah , i prefer it .
&quot; dad &quot; isn &apos;t an accurate characterization
of our relationship .
he &apos;s your son .
he &apos;s her son .
biologically , he &apos;s yours .
ontologically , he &apos;s getting in the way of my work .
well , psychologically , you &apos;re a freakin &apos; sociopath .
do you see how desperately that boy
is trying to connect with you ?
and you do everything you can to push him away .
i &apos;m not interested in the relationship .
tough .
i mean , he &apos;s not a novel you can just toss aside ,
if it &apos;s boring .
or a painting you just walk past
&apos;cause it &apos;s not interesting .
he &apos;s a person with feelings .
okay , just keep going . this is really making the time fly by .
i have spent the last few weeks trying to get you to like me ,
and i just realized something . i don &apos;t like you .
your painting is in the utility closet
next to your classroom .
go take care of your masterpiece .
i &apos;ll take care of your son .
hi .
thank you for letting me tag along
trick @-@ or @-@ treating .
chloe &apos;s 20 now ,
so i &apos;m nostalgic for things like this .
aw , you &apos;re lucky . my older kids
are 20 as well , but this one kept knocking me up ,
so now i won &apos;t get to be nostalgic until i &apos;m 90 .
so ... is penny ready ?
&apos;cause we gotta get to the mcallisters&apos;
before they run out of popcorn balls .
she &apos;s just putting on her costume ...
that i sewed with my hands ,
and i &apos;m pretty proud of it .
mom !
this is amazing .
look . i &apos;m a kitten with a whip .
meow .
this is just
in case she &apos;s attacked by dogs .
you &apos;re proud of this ?
yep . i thought it was cute .
yeah , if she &apos;s trick @-@ or @-@ treating for dollar bills !
it &apos;s completely inappropriate !
honey , go back upstairs
and see if you can find those &quot; smarty pants . &quot;
do i have to ?
penny , are you sure you put the whole costume on ?
i think so .
there wasn &apos;t a skirt that went with it ?
&apos;cause i &apos;m pretty sure a skirt was a part of that pattern .
right ?
yeah , yeah . there was .
well , i &apos;d bet i could help you find that skirt your mom made .
i bet you could .
go on .
trick or treat ? !
hold that thought .
trick or treat ? !
what amazing costumes .
now don &apos;t get me with your hook .
and look at you . aren &apos;t you the prettiest little princess
in the whole ... world ...
now ... let &apos;s see if we can find something &quot; fun size &quot;
for me to enjoy .
whoa ! is it , uh ...
is it hot in here ?
uh ... don &apos;t think so .
okay .
maybe i should , uh , take off a layer .
you all right ?
i &apos;m not sure . i &apos;ve got this ...
this tightness in my throat .
yeah , and your eyes look a little glassy .
uh , you sure you &apos;re okay ?
we can do this another night , you know .
no , no , no . i &apos;m fine , really .
now ... get over here , big man .
what about the house with the spiderwebs and the bats ?
that didn &apos;t scare you ?
nah , it takes a lot more than that to scare me . aah !
how did you get in here ?
this was under the mat .
it &apos;s a great hiding place , by the way .
had me stumped for a good four seconds .
mommy ?
can we go trade candy ?
well , you &apos;ll have to ask jasper &apos;s ...
andre .
yeah , it &apos;s fine .
all right . yeah .
thought you were gonna finish your painting .
i will .
but i was thinking about what you said .
and you realized the error of your ways
and came to tell me that ?
god . is that how things work in your world ?
look , i get you don &apos;t like me . most people don &apos;t .
i &apos;ve learned to live with that mainly by not caring .
oh . i think you care .
i swear to god i don &apos;t .
you have to understand , susan .
my work is always gonna come first .
even before jasper ?
that &apos;s what i was getting to . i heard what you said .
he is my son .
and i &apos;m gonna try to be a better dad .
well , i bet it &apos;ll make you a better painter .
i bet it won &apos;t .
you need to know something about being a true artist .
this--this gift , this curse , whatever it is--
it consumes you and blots out everything else--
friends , family , everything .
i would never let that happen to me .
you may not have a choice .
trick or ...
that &apos;s weird . they didn &apos;t even wait for the candy .
how &apos;s dinner coming ?
oh , it &apos;s just about r-- oh , my god .
what happened to you ?
what ?
you need to see a doctor .
oh . over this little rash ? don &apos;t be silly .
stand still , stop running in circles .
i &apos;m not moving .
oh , that &apos;s not good .
you know , o @-@ on second thought ,
i &apos;m not really feeling very ...
oh , okay . okay .
definitely time for a doctor .
almost finished .
wow , from cathouse to house cat in ten minutes .
you could do this professionally .
you mean like the person who made it ?
yeah . i may have ...
slightly overexaggerated my sewing skills .
i guess ... i was feeling ...
this is new for me .
it &apos;s new for me , too .
you gonna bust me ?
for trying to look good ?
lynette , when my husband left me
for our swedish au pair ,
i went out and bought my daughter a car .
she was 13 .
well , then it &apos;s official .
you &apos;re better at everything , even bribery .
please . you had a career and raised five kids .
i could barely keep it together with one .
who says i kept it together ?
i think you &apos;re doing pretty great .
you &apos;re smart , confident .
in fact , this might sound a little weird ,
but ... you seem like the kind of person i could be friends with .
it doesn &apos;t sound weird .
before , when you saved my ass out there ,
that was the kind of thing a friend does .
happy to help .
then ...
can i ask you to help me with something else ?
sure .
you think maybe you could stop
trying to take my husband away from me ?
what ?
your marriage ended .
you know what this feels like .
whoa . whoa . that &apos;s not fair .
the circumstances were completely different .
maybe they were .
but you still know how it hurts .
so i &apos;m asking you , please ,
back off .
okay ?
you think i &apos;m gonna give up on him
just because you can &apos;t accept your marriage is over ?
we have five kids .
one of them is just a baby .
i &apos;m not letting my husband go without a fight .
well , according to tom , you &apos;re always looking for a fight .
my ex was like that , too .
you know , and when you find somebody who isn &apos;t ,
you wanna hang on to them .
you should give this to penny .
okay , the girls are asleep . listen for the doorbell
in case there are some late trick @-@ or @-@ treaters .
i know the drill .
oh , and don &apos;t wait up for me . i &apos;ll be late .
we &apos;re taking lynette out for a drink .
oh . sorry .
i &apos;m fine , gaby .
it &apos;s just her first holiday
without tom and the kids ,
so we wanna give her a fun night out ,
you know , to boost her spirits .
bye .
we &apos;re digging up the body tonight ?
we have no choice .
ben &apos;s bulldozers start tearing up the woods tomorrow morning .
where are carlos and susan ?
carlos is not in a good place right now .
i didn &apos;t wanna freak him out .
and susan has done nothing but freak out ,
so it &apos;s just us .
come on .
oh . okay .
i ... i can &apos;t believe this .
we &apos;re getting rid of a dead body again .
i know . i &apos;m so sorry .
no , i just spent the evening
with my husband &apos;s new girlfriend .
this doesn &apos;t sound so bad .
how you feeling ?
better .
they gave me a shot of cortisone .
the doctor said it was something i ate .
maybe strawberries or nuts .
really ? uh , he told me it was the woman love fluid .
okay . good @-@ bye . nice knowing you .
i mean , you do know
you &apos;re not supposed to roofie yourself , right ?
go away .
well , i don &apos;t get it .
now why would you take something like that ?
because ... i wanted tonight to be special , okay ?
and ...
because i haven &apos;t been with anyone since my divorce .
you ...
when i moved here , you offered me sex
before you even knew my name .
well , yeah , but that was before ...
can i put the sheet back on ?
that was before i realized how much i like you .
well , i like you , too .
uh , would you like some , uh , company under there ?
trick or treat
trick or treat
uh , so this is the part where you give me candy .
i don &apos;t know about this . what ever happened
to &quot; never return to the scene of the crime &quot; ?
she &apos;s got a point .
we just need to do this
in the most efficient manner possible--
find the grave , dig up the body ...
sounds easy so far .
wrap it in a tarp , weight it down with some bricks
and toss it in the lake .
i have all the supplies in my trunk ,
along with clean towels , hand sanitizer ,
and breathing masks in case the stench is overwhelming .
anyone wanna guess what a corpse looks like
after two months in the ground ? ohh .
oh , yeah . is it just bones ,
or is there , like , other stuff , too ?
did you hear something ?
yeah . what is that ?
who &apos;s there ?
who is that ? !
i don &apos;t know .
what do we do ?
run .
okay !
no ! split up .
where &apos;d he go ? is he gone ?
for now , but we gotta hurry .
i @-@ i think we &apos;re close . i recognize this area .
oh , god , this is creeping me out .
well , it doesn &apos;t help that it &apos;s halloween .
let &apos;s just dig him up and get this over with .
okay .
gaby ?
lynette ?
oh , my god .

paranoia ...
it &apos;s the irrational feeling
that the whole world is against you .
