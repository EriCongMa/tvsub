he wanted to end it .
last time he wanted to stop coming , but l talked him out of it .
why ?
lf l was at sloan and he had a pituitary tumor . . .
. . .would l stop him from coming ?
elliot , it &apos;s like that thing with watching a train wreck .
l &apos;m afraid and repulsed by what he might tell me .
but somehow l can &apos;t stop myself from wanting to hear it .
okay .

lt makes me look like a sick man .
you &apos;re not sick .

how he could make such heartache funny is beyond me .
my god , with that father .
we don &apos;t know what poverty is .
didn &apos;t the mother come off nicer ?

that &apos;s what he said .
l guess nobody should eat but him .
you should &apos;ve seen him in the golf outfit .
he looked like wallace beery .
where does he get the effrontery ?
he &apos;s the boss . whether he has grand mals or not .
and this shit is okay with you ?
l know that you love him , junior .
l don &apos;t want to say anything disparaging .

my finances are nobody &apos;s damn business .
that garbage is my business .
l don &apos;t want you and that shitbird fucking it up !
your business ?
why don &apos;t you get that through that bald dome of yours ?
why does everything have to be so difficult ?
you know , back in the &apos; 50s we worked together .
even rival families settled their differences amicably .
l remember albert anastasia lying all amicable on the barbershop floor .
there were exceptions. l &apos;m just saying .
l &apos;m sorry . should l come back ?
lt &apos;s all right .
we &apos;re done here .
so bad night last night , huh ?

l suggest you talk about stress management with him .
to tell you the truth , l was surprised to hear from you .
l was sorry we missed our visit .
l had a feeling you weren &apos;t interested .
oh , no .
l stopped by the other day , but l guess you were out .

funny how life works . the different paths .
all leading to the cemetery .
can l ask you something , corrado ?
was my lou ever , you know , on the take ?
no , of course not .
why would you ask such a thing ?
sometimes , you know , l &apos;d find money .
hundreds of dollars . cash. ln his pockets at night .
probably won it at the racetrack .
you think so ?
sure , why not ?
somebody has to win .
well , the kitchen needs some work .
you know , a little marble , maybe some new fixtures .
lt &apos;s nice .
think they &apos;ll come down on the price ?
l don &apos;t know .
