oh , the rain has washed away the playground shed !
i &apos;m being chased by sports !
it &apos;s called &quot; precipitation , &quot; &apos; cause it never fails
to precipitate unruly behavior .
and saddest of all , those who do not have a friend
to play with in the rain ,
doomed to get only single pneumonia .
a spit wad ?
well , at least i &apos;m getting some attention .
and the best part is i &apos;m bombarding her
with her own homework .
丽莎 · 辛普森
begone !

the autobiography of charles manson ?
古老西部时代的文化和习俗

lisa , you got a call from someone named isabel .
may i ask what this is regarding ?
ooh ! a budding new friendship ? oh !
boy , how come you can &apos;t get a new friend ?
what &apos;s wrong with the one i got ?
i finally got that m &amp; m out of my inner ear .
i remembered correctly , it was a green one !
don &apos;t eat it . it &apos;s been in his ear .
don &apos;t eat it.it &apos;s been in his ear .

it makes reading impossible .
lisa , your food &apos;s getting cold !
it &apos;s raw veggies . they &apos;re supposed to be cold !
well , someone who loves you put melted butter on them !
thank you , mr. bergstrom .
i &apos;ll tell lisa you dropped by .
i better go .
okay , but one more thing :
i noticed we &apos;re both doing presentations
on franklin roosevelt at school . why don &apos;t we do them together ?
oh , my god . someone wants to be my partner .
can &apos;t screw this up .
downloading , downloading , downloading ,
downloading , downloading ...
franklin roosevelt bravely instituted
a series of reforms called the new deal .
which ran totally counter
to america &apos;s tradition of limited government .
p.s. it was also unconstitutional .
um , fdr &apos;s steadfast leadership
also helped america win world war two .
until the weak @-@ kneed democrats sold us out at yalta .
if you haven &apos;t guessed , lisa , i &apos;m a republican .
a lincoln republican ?
not really .
a reagan republican ?
keep going .
first president bush ?
getting there .
oh , dear god .
i must say , lisa ,
it was amusing to see you thoroughly de @-@ high @-@ horsed .
that isn &apos;t a word .
ooh , back on the saddle she climbs .
i just can &apos;t believe someone like you
would be a republican .
i mean , isn &apos;t your last name gutiérrez ?
just what exactly are you saying ?
i &apos;m just saying that people of your heritage-
which could be any one of many heritages ,
i &apos;m not pigeonholing ...
is it a catholic thing ?
i &apos;m a non @-@ observant jew from argentina .
ay , caramba !
do you even know what that means ?
uh , there @-@ there &apos;s a caramba in my eye ?
it &apos;s the spanish version of &quot; hot damn . &quot;
ay , caramba !
hmm ? lisa , is everything okay ?
yes . why ?
because you &apos;re doing your homework
and you don &apos;t look happy .
my new best friend isn &apos;t what i thought .
she &apos;s a ... republican !
what is so funny ?
they &apos;re destroying the world !
they are , huh ?
i thought i &apos;d show you this
when you were older , but ...
美国的早晨
you voted for reagan ? !
it was a crazy time , the &apos; 80s .
you don &apos;t hear me listening to the thompson twins anymore .
although ...
* hold me now ... *
so , you were going through a phase ?
all right , &apos; 80s party !
where &apos;s the beef ?
* tear down that wall *
* because i think the beef is behind that wall *
鼓舞人心绝佳歌曲
* you say i &apos;m a dreamer ... *
now get up here , boy !
we &apos;re gonna do &quot; the super bowl shuffle . &quot;
no ! you never let me be mike singletary !
fine . you &apos;re mike singletary .
enjoy your mediocre coaching career .
my name is homer , i &apos;m a real fullback
gonna run that ball , don &apos;t want no flack
if you try to run , you &apos;ll get a heart attack
why you little ... !
hey , big man , don &apos;t want no trouble
i &apos;m just here to do &quot; the super bowl ...
shuffle ... &quot;
excuse me .
people &apos;s views change .
bobby kennedy worked for joe mccarthy .
larry david was on fridays .
what are you trying to say ?
isabel &apos;s only eight . as she grows up ,
surprising things will happen
to her body ... of beliefs .
but she could always use a friend like you .
isabel ?
lisa ?
listen , i &apos;m really sorry about ...
no , it &apos;s okay .
my mom says you &apos;re just going through a liberal phase .
what ? ! my mom says you &apos;re going through a conservative phase .
there &apos;s no such thing .
conservatives only get more conservative .
because every year ,
they get a little further through atlas shrugged .
listen , we &apos;re both eight years old .
can &apos;t we just play monopoly or something ?
my father owns a monopoly !
尚有28 % 空缺
that young filly is exactly the kind of candidate
we need to start recruiting !
she &apos;s a young , dynamic latina .
yee @-@ haw ! i said that just right !
without the hispanic vote ,
even texas is poised to turn blue .
blue !
yeah , we must reach her and groom her
before she fattens up like chris christie .
he thinks gop stands for &quot; gravy on pancakes . &quot;
but despite my mirthful remarks , obesity is no laughing matter .
雄起吧少年 来竞选班委
just can &apos;t resist those words , &quot; sign @-@ up sheet . &quot;
oh , looks like i &apos;ll be running against isabel .
and ralph ?
just call me ralph nader .
i don &apos;t know why .
isabel !
i want this campaign to be about the issues :
same @-@ sex field trip buddies ,
providing class pets with a path to citizenship ...
and no digging up past relationships .
sure , lisa and i dated .
sure , she broke my heart .
i &apos;m sure your researchers know all about it .
this is the first i &apos;ve heard of it .
really ? but i got this !
how long has it been since you washed your stomach ?
you can &apos;t ask that anymore !
quit shoving !
i &apos;d like a word with you , young lady .
how did you get in there ?
slid in through the grates .
here &apos;s the scoop .
you &apos;re our future ,
so we can &apos;t afford to have you lose .
and i love the spanish--
from the inquisition to the delightful franco years .
佛朗哥时期 弗朗西斯科 · 佛朗哥独裁统治西班牙的时期
what are you talking about ?
move over ! i know how to talk to kids .
we want to give you a little present .
a tainted victory that will haunt you forever .
i &apos;d rather do this myself .
but who &apos;d own you then ?
you couldn &apos;t buy me with a wheelbarrow full of ice cream .
whoa , nicely done .
you &apos;ve charmed another one right into the arms
of the libertarian party .
maybe we can help her without her knowing we &apos;re helping her .
no one says i can &apos;t buy a second grade election .
why , i had enough money to fix people magazine &apos;s
sexiest man alive .
most of the money went to convincing them
that i was alive .
who ordered the yumboni ?
right here !
now , smithers , i want you to eat this for me .
describe every taste .
and don &apos;t forget the brain freeze .
sir , i am lactose @-@ intolerant .
and i &apos;m back @-@ talk @-@ allergic !
so start eating !
have a great day , kids .
and , bart , i &apos;ll pick you up after school
to take you to karate lessons .
mom , after six weeks , i figured out
that sensei weinstein is really my psychiatrist .
either way , for 45 minutes , you &apos;re not my problem , sweetie .
don &apos;t worry , lisa , despite the paid ad ,
i am strictly middle of the road .
idiot !
pick a lane !
what are you doing ? !
i &apos;m as bewildered as you are .
i don &apos;t know why ,
but the springfield republican party is grooming me .
grooming ? yuck !
unfortunately , i can &apos;t stop it .
the supreme court says spending money is free speech .
well , then you could use your free speech
to denounce this intrusion of big money into our election .
mm , i &apos;ll think about it
while i &apos;m on my listening tour of the cafeteria .
pour me another .
what are you doing ?
it &apos;s imaginary .
fine .
i got to go .
i &apos;ll see you later .
ay , caramba !
bart , i need you to help me win the election .
i can help , but it &apos;s gonna get rough .
i &apos;m fine with rough .
you don &apos;t know what rough is .
that ain &apos;t rough .
more like a gentle breeze .
maggie hits harder .
did the good night pixie just kiss my cheek ?
okay , you got my attention .
you want to win this election ?
then from now on , you do exactly what i say .
now , the other candidate , lisa simpson .
okay , i &apos;m a liberal .
and sometimes that &apos;s a dirty word .
liberal .
but what liberal really means is someone who believes
that those who have more than enough
should share a little with those who don &apos;t .
and those principles
have consistently been in place
during this country &apos;s most prosperous times .
so if that &apos;s a liberal ,
then i am a liberal .
and hang me .
sorry , we &apos;re just setting up
for an occurrence at owl creek bridge .
the democratic party pantheon .
四大自由 新政 新边疆
such lofty ideals .
and here come the spirits .
michael dukakis , walter mondale ,
john kerry ?
these are all losers !
i &apos;m afraid you &apos;re heading for a loss , lisa .
and when we lose , we lose big .
what about obama ?
harry truman ?
bill clinton ?
lisa , you &apos;re a lot like me .
play the saxophone , come from a small town ,
raised by a mother with no help .
so , do you know how i can win ?
i don &apos;t even know why i &apos;m a ghost .
all these guys are alive .
john kerry here is secretary of state .
doing a bang @-@ up job .
well , we still have a long way
to go on asian currency issues .
absolutely .
and , lisa , i &apos;m only appearing in this dream
so i can visit with you about the clinton global initiative .
see , our mission is to turn ideas into action .
and to find innovative solutions that will hel ...
hey , hey , hey !
you can &apos;t fall asleep in a dream !
i know what i &apos;ve got to do .
hello , isabel ? listen ...

electioneering or negative campaigning .
if my friend lisa wins , so be it .
and i also want to say that if ...
time &apos;s up . but i ...
stop showboating .
back in the banner shed you go .
good morning .
we have completed the tally of the votes
for class representative .
one brief announcement : the tainted greek salad
has given several students
nightmares involving michael dukakis .
it may recur tonight , so if possible ,
have your parents strap you to the bed .
and now the results .
first grade rep-- results delayed indefinitely
due to jelly on the ballots .
second grade rep--
isabel gutierrez .
third grade rep , no votes cast .
congratulations , isabel .
fourth grade rep-- last name weiner , first name ima ...

do it and you &apos;ll kill him .
hey , lis .
hey .
i &apos;m sorry i fired you .
eh , no hard feelings .
a lot of good things have been happening to me .
thanks , bart.
i think you might feel better
if you looked at these exit polls .
they find me a pointy @-@ haired know @-@ it @-@ all .
yes , but they agreed with everything you said .
what are you getting at ?
53 % said they &apos;d vote for a liberal .
just not you .
huh . you hear that , world ?
they love my ideas , just not me !
and that is half the battle !
ha !
hello , i &apos;m elder anderson cooper .
welcome to our first debate
between republican isabel gutierrez
and lisa simpson , representing
the democratic robot zombie coalition .
first question : ms. simpson , what would you do
to get america out of afghanistan ?
i &apos;d just throw in the towel and make it a state .
that &apos;s our girl .
