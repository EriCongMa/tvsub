what &apos;s that ?
i got a mysterious package ,
postmarked las vegas .
baume &amp; mercier .
oh , my god .
this is so beautiful .
i had it engraved .
here .
&quot; you are my life . love , t. &quot;
they couldn &apos;t fit &quot; tony .
i believe that .
thank you .
but i don &apos;t know what it &apos;s for .
well , like i said , i was sorry
i had to go out to vegas when i did .
once you explained
you had to take care of christopher &apos;s business interests ...
god knows kelli &apos;ll need the money .
the baby .
i &apos;m talking about delay
just take care of that , all right ?
bobby ?
john stefano .
you touching asbestos ?
no , i don &apos;t work with that shit .
it &apos;s ok .
shame about chris moltisanti .
where &apos;d you get these bozos ?
ecuadorians . bunch of &apos; em polacks .
why ain &apos;t they wearing space suits ?
that &apos;s a union rule .
if i couldn &apos;t run this job without that contract ,
none of us gonna make any real scratch .
you don &apos;t got an envelope ?
you must have seen fights before .
your friends beating up the african kid ,
why do you think that &apos;s been impossible to shake ?
they had my back after all the shit with blanca .
they care about me .
did you try to stop the beating ?
i &apos;m one individual . what could i do ?
i know kids on lexapro who say it &apos;s great
and i still feel like shit .
why can &apos;t i catch a fucking break ?
your classes , how are you enjoying those ?
english is boring .
and the other one &apos;s kind of interesting
but it &apos;s pretty depressing .
the lsraeli @-@ palestinian conflict ?
people blowing each other up because their god says
they &apos;re allowed to live in a certain patch of fucking sand .
and other people &apos;s gods say they &apos;re supposed to live there .
maybe i shouldn &apos;t have taken it .
you seem to be taking it all personally .
these mujahideen assholes , like in lndonesia ,
and they want to kill everybody .
have you considered writing about your ...
experience with the somali boy ?
a short story , perhaps ?
why would i do that ?
it might help clarify your feelings .
i was watching cnn
and this story about these kids in some lraqi hospital ,
how the burn unit doesn &apos;t have the right medicine or something .
and then they show this story
about some mall in minnesota
and these gigantic fat people
buying stuff
and eating all this shit .
it &apos;s like my parents .
you should see our house .
the stupid coffee maker they got ,
the media room .
then there &apos;s blanca .
her kid hardly talks .
she can &apos;t afford to send him to a decent school .
you think your feelings about blanca
in any way relate to this african boy ?
she &apos;s not black .
i mean ,
she &apos;s pretty tan .
there he is .
hey . welcome back .
welcome back , tone .
good to see you again .
how was your trip ?
great . had a fucking blast .
yeah ?
business too . christopher &apos;s shit .
some fucking guys out there owed him money .
little carmine took it on the cleaver set .
we had it framed .
talk about a trip
i met this girl , fucking beautiful .
yeah ?
boys .
hey .
we did peyote .
come on .
really ?
bobby did mushrooms once .
stuffed mushrooms , a whole platter .
fuck you .
anyway , that &apos;s some nutty shit ,
the desert ,
the light .
i did x once . the fucking was incredible .
yeah , you kidding ? off the fucking charts .
you wouldn &apos;t believe it .
really ?
and the sun
came up
yeah ?
we saw stefano .
he didn &apos;t have an envelope .
any movement on that ?
we should probably see phil .
i got dosed with acid once , back in &apos; 68 .
i was with your dad and them at the copa .
fucking boac stewardess put it in my drink .
jerry vale started singing and i look over ,
your uncle jun &apos;s got laser beams shooting out of his eyes .
i used to love that house , but now
it &apos;s so big , especially at night .
you &apos;re afraid , all you got to do is call .
right ?
two minutes , i &apos;ll be over .
i know . thank you .
you &apos;ve been so great . both of you .
meadow had another mystery date .
that sounds exciting .
what are you doing ? sit .
i made your favourite , steak pizzaiola .
they spray a virus on beef
rather than clean the rat shit out of slaughterhouses .
what is this now ?
it &apos;s true . read the paper .
i do read the paper . never heard that .
i &apos;m not talking about the sports page .
the fda ,
they approved a virus spray because it kills
a similar bacteria found on meat .
must be a good thing , then .
yeah . for the meat packers ,
the fucking god of the bottom line .
all right , that &apos;s enough .
we &apos;re trying to eat here
and you &apos;re upsetting people that have been through a tragedy .
fine . bury your head in the sand .
how about i bury yours in that fucking wall instead ?
tony .
20 years , he won &apos;t crack a book .
all of a sudden he &apos;s the world &apos;s foremost authority .
at least he &apos;s getting an education .
an education &apos;s to help you get a better job .
he &apos;s actually reading . this can &apos;t be bad .
&quot; the blood @-@ dimmed tide is loosed
&quot; and everywhere the ceremony of innocence
is drowned .
&quot; the best lack all conviction ,
&quot; while the worst are full of passionate intensity .
&quot; surely some revelation is at hand .
&quot; somewhere in the sands of the desert
&quot; a shape with lion body
&quot; a gaze blank and pitiless as the sun ,
&quot; is moving its slow thighs ,
&quot; while all about it reel shadows of the indignant desert birds .
&quot; the darkness drops again ,
&quot; but now i know that twenty centuries of stony sleep
&quot; were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle ,
&quot; and what rough beast , its hour come round at last ,
&quot; slouches towards bethlehem to be born ? &quot;
hey , tony .
you don &apos;t look so good .
this job .
you want a sandwich , a cannoli ,
on the house ?
no . this microbe of mine ,
from pakistan .
still ?
you got a minute ?
we &apos;d like to show you some pictures .
angelina jolie , i hope .
these the gentlemen ?
that &apos;s them .
what the fuck ? what ?
don &apos;t know . financing , maybe .
maybe
yeah .
honestly , i &apos;m not even sure we still have them in the country .
thanks for stopping by .
next time we &apos;ll have party hats .
your nephew &apos;s widow ,
she get my flowers ?
well , if you sent &apos; em , i &apos;m sure she did .
well , i won &apos;t expect a thank you any time soon .
the grieving process takes time the closer you are to somebody .
yeah , i know .
so , brass tacks ,
what brings you all the way out to the city ?
good news . the condos at the navy yard .
paulie &apos;s guy at the joint fitters says
they &apos;re breaking ground .
well , that is good .
good , yeah .
the other thing , this asbestos .
i thought about your offer .
what do you say to 15 %
plus we forget about the balance
of what you owe me on the vitamin truck ?
first off , it wasn &apos;t an offer .
it &apos;s my position . 25 % .
that &apos;s it ?
what else would you like me to say ?
come on , phil , what &apos;s the problem ?
i come here in good faith ,
i make a reasonable counter .
which i considered and rejected .
do we need to talk in private ?
for what ?
ok , then , in front of everybody
when you were sick
in the hospital ,
we talked .
we shared a
an understanding about life .
this is business , anthony .
yeah , i know .
but i &apos;m talking to you here on a human level .
there &apos;s a limit , phil . come on .
a point where business bleeds into other shit ,
feelings make things financially unfeasible .
charles schwab over here .
so that &apos;s it ?
no leeway , no compromise , just stupid fucking jokes ?
you want compromise ? how &apos;s this ?
20 years in the can ,
i wanted manicotte .
but i compromised .
i ate grilled cheese off the radiator instead .
i wanted to fuck a woman
but i compromised again .
i jacked off in a tissue .
you see where i &apos;m going ?
yeah .
butch , coco , didn &apos;t anybody call you ?
about what ?
don &apos;t tell me the cheques are late .
there ain &apos;t any cheques .
the fuck you talking about ?
silvio , mr soprano &apos;s guy ,
came by this morning , said to pull your jobs .
fuck that .
where &apos;s our money ?
i don &apos;t got it . there &apos;s no jobs .
motherfucker .
i &apos;m sorry . somebody should have called you .
jesus christ !
guys , that &apos;s enough . it &apos;s not his fault .
yeah ? maybe it &apos;s your fucking fault .
call the police !
tony soprano owes you $ 320 .
hey .
i was just watching borat on cable .
you can watch that thing 50 times and it &apos;s still hilarious .
he brings that lady his shits .
it wasn &apos;t fair to the people involved .
you loved it when it came out .
what do you want , meadow ?
how was your exam ?
i didn &apos;t take it .
leave that .
ok ? thank you .
why didn &apos;t you take the test ?
cos i dropped out , ok ?
what &apos;s going on with you ?
i &apos;m your sister .
you have to talk to me .
is this still about blanca ?
you know , i don &apos;t know any more .
i know how you feel , ok ?
when finn and i split i cried every day
for a month .
you realise we &apos;re gonna bomb lran ?
you don &apos;t know that .
you watch .
bush , before he leaves office
and you know i &apos;m right .
ok .
but you need to learn to shut stuff out .
are you crazy ?
i mean , do you hear what we &apos;re talking about ?
you say that , but i come in here
and you &apos;re surfing the web for porn .
it &apos;s not porn .
al jazeera ?
don &apos;t you ever feel like there &apos;s no point to any of this ?
why don &apos;t you try setting goals for yourself ?
maybe you should move out .
right . in my condition
i mean , i can &apos;t hold a job .
jesus , aj , there has to be something you can do .
look , i &apos;m ill , meadow . all right , i &apos;m on medication .
millions of people take lexapro .
i need mom &apos;s cooking .
it could mess with my blood chemistry .
do mom and dad know you dropped out ?
no , and don &apos;t tell them .
i took time off , remember ?
they broke my balls but it really wasn &apos;t so bad .
of course not . i mean , you &apos;re their pet .
we &apos;re ltalian , aj . you &apos;re their son .
do you have any idea what that means ?
you &apos;ll always be more important .
you &apos;re awake .
i made lincoln log sandwiches .
maybe later .
i am meeting gab for lunch
and then we are stopping at nordstrom .
if you go out , make sure you set the alarm .
ok ?
jeez !

help !
help ! my arms ! they &apos;re frozen !
aj , what the fuck ?
dad ! help !
help !

what the fuck did you do ?
help !
all right , i got you . stop fighting me .
all right . don &apos;t !
all right , turn around . grab the side .
grab the side right there .
all right .
all right .
god damn it .
hold that .
help me .
all right , climb .
what &apos;s wrong with you ?
all right . are you all right ?
all right , come here .
come on .
turn around .
come on , baby .
you &apos;re all right , baby .
you &apos;re all right , baby . you &apos;re all right .
you &apos;re all right .
well , here we are .
i &apos;ll get him settled . you can come tomorrow during visiting hours .
i love you , sweetie .
i love you .
i love you too .
he &apos;s had a lot of valium .
but he was better for a while .
look , it &apos;s not your fault .
you warned us .
come on , come on .
come on , it &apos;s gonna be ok .
it will , mom .
but he was always so happy .
he was our happy little boy .
come here , baby .
there you go . white balls .
skip .
hey , tone .
there he is .
you hungry , t ? i &apos;ll send the kid for baja fresh .
anything from phil ?
no , not yet .
all right , let &apos;s dispense with the 500 @-@ pound elephant in the room .
my kid tried to off himself .
we all fucking know .
that &apos;s it .
nobody &apos;s got nothing to say ?
how &apos;s he doing , tone ?
they got him under observation .
whatever the fuck that means .
stupid fuck .
where did i lose this kid ?
what did i do wrong ?
come on .
don &apos;t blame yourself , t.
a lot of pressure on kids today , tone .
still , to try to kill himself ?
it happens , skip .
happen to your kids ?
or yours ?
they &apos;re all different , tone .
my son patrick ?
i love him to death
but he can be a moody prick sometimes .
heather , you know , she was 1.5,
she went through a rough patch .
jason , same thing .
and he &apos;s got the hyperactivity to boot .
my son too . the older one , james .
he tried to kill himself ?
no .
i don &apos;t know , he gets the blues .
the important thing is aj &apos;s getting the help he needs .
whatever it is , i &apos;m sure it &apos;s a chemical imbalance .
ask me , it &apos;s all these toxins they &apos;re exposed to .
it fucks with their brains .
between the mercury in fish alone ,
it &apos;s a wonder there ain &apos;t more kids jumping off bridges .
i can &apos;t fucking shake it .
shake what ?
i &apos;m depressed .
excuse me ?
i &apos;m depressed .
i &apos;m telling you , don &apos;t you start now .
what does that mean ?
it means what it means .
i have enough on my plate . i don &apos;t need you adding to it with your bullshit .
bullshit ?
it &apos;s an illness .
and it &apos;s fucking hereditary .
thank you , i know .
i am intimately acquainted with the soprano curse .
your father , your uncle , your great @-@ grandfather
who drove the donkey cart off the road in avellino ,
all of it .
you think it &apos;s a joke ?
am i laughing ?
then what are you saying ?
he didn &apos;t get it from my family ,
that &apos;s all i &apos;m gonna say .
your family don &apos;t even talk .
your father &apos;s so bottled up
it &apos;s a wonder he &apos;s even got a stomach left .
as opposed to yours ?
my father was out @-@ front about what bothered him .
with a bullet through your mother &apos;s beehive hairdo .
i knew it .
i was wondering how long it would take for you to throw that at me .
you &apos;re amazing . you know ?
in high school , you were the happy @-@ go @-@ lucky rascal ,
the comedian , the rapscallion .
but all of that was bullshit , wasn &apos;t it ?
poor you .
she got married under false pretences .
you &apos;ve been playing the depression card
until it is worn to shreds .
and now you &apos;ve got our son doing it .
card ? card ?
you heard me .
so it &apos;s all me ,
our sonny boy ? you had nothing to do with it ?
it wears you down , tony . that &apos;s all i &apos;m saying .
do you have any idea what it &apos;s like to spend day after day
with somebody who is constantly complaining ?
fuck you .
it could have been a cry for help .
aren &apos;t you listening ? he did cry for help .
he &apos;s lucky i came home and heard him .
i meant the botched attempt .
on some level , he may have known
that the rope was too long to keep him submerged .
or he could just be a fucking idiot .
historically , that &apos;s been the case .
me and carm were getting along so good too .
my father and his panic attacks ,
my fucking demented uncle ,
not to mention the other one , eckley the fucking retard .
you think there are other reasons why your son is so unhappy ?
he &apos;s got the world by the balls ,
every fucking advantage ,
and he hits one little pothole and he goes into hysterics .
yeah , i know .
i &apos;m not taking the rap ,
not completely .
she coddled him , his mother . i said it before .
every little problem , she &apos;s right there to pick him up
and wipe off his tears
on her apron strings .
children need to feel safe .
i &apos;m sure that made him into the man he is today .
are you ashamed of him ?
yeah , actually i am .
the coward &apos;s way out .
isn &apos;t that what they call it ?
i think whoever said that didn &apos;t understand depression .
but you do , don &apos;t you ?
where &apos;s dad ?
meadow got rear @-@ ended on bloomfield avenue .
he &apos;ll come see you later .
is he still mad ?
he was never mad , aj .
he loves you .
how long do i have to stay here ?
dr. vogel thinks it might be a good idea for
the time being just to take a time @-@ out .
like i &apos;m in preschool
did you see dr. vogel today ?
today we have group .
did you eat today ?
i had some turkey . it had no flavour at all .
i &apos;ll bring some chicken parm tomorrow .
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s allowed on
account of all the bulimic girls .
so it &apos;s front @-@ row mezzanine at grey gardens
and the guy says
excuse me .
you &apos;re tony soprano &apos;s kid ?
yeah .
small world , running into you like this .
i &apos;m sorry , do i know you ?
you got a little cream on your mouth , sweetie .
be happy to add to it .
what ?
excuse me .
lucky guy , her dad .
must be fun tucking her in at night .
do you have a problem ?
not yet .
would you like one ?
coco , come on .
what ? i &apos;m saying hello .
come on , let &apos;s go .
hey , best to your dad .
what the hell was that ?
but that is not for you to decide .
don &apos;t say anything .
what , are you two talking about me again ?
what &apos;s the matter ?
nothing .
what ?
do you know a guy named coco ?
why ?
she was out on a date last night
and he came over and pulled some crap .
what ?
how ?
we were in the city , little ltaly .
we were having dessert
and he came up out of nowhere
and just started saying all this weird stuff .
what kind of weird stuff ?
how he &apos;d like to tuck me in at night .
stuff like that .
tuck you in ?
i could smell the sambuca on his breath .
what exactly did he say ?
he came up to us
and he asked me if i was your daughter
and then he said
i had whipped cream on my mouth .
yeah ?
what else did he say ?
it &apos;s all right .
it &apos;s ok . he &apos;s an idiot
but he &apos;s harmless .
i &apos;ll talk to somebody .
so this boy you &apos;re dating ,
this man , who is he ?
you promise not to start with an inquisition ?
will you stop with all the secrecy , please ?
it &apos;s patrick parisi , ok ?
you &apos;re kidding me .
that &apos;s exactly why i didn &apos;t want to tell you
and why he didn &apos;t tell uncle patsy .
i thought he where are you going ?
meeting . sil .
we have dr. vogel later , don &apos;t forget .
i thought pat parisi was engaged .
they broke it off .
we kind of hooked up at the cleaver premiere ,
we started talking .
he &apos;s changed a lot .
i really like him .
so why the big mystery all this time ?
i knew you and daddy never liked him .
no , it &apos;s not that we didn &apos;t like him ,
it &apos;s just ...
so all those times you told me
you were staying with your friend kimmie in the city ,
i suppose you were at his apartment ?
sometimes .
look , there &apos;s something else .
what ?
i &apos;ve decided not to go to med school .
what ? why ?
it &apos;s just too hard .
lsn &apos;t anything that &apos;s worthwhile ?
you have no idea .
of course not .
don &apos;t get sarcastic .
i really think it &apos;s law for me .
you should hear patrick talk about the justice system
and what it means .
it &apos;s really inspiring .
obviously sheila resents me . i &apos;m dating her father .
the sullen looks ,
the transference to me of her issues with her mom .
as your favourite patient says ,
&quot; maybe i should put my shoe up her ass ? &quot;
which patient of mine says that ?
mine , elliot .
your favourite patient of mine
he hasn &apos;t been in the paper much lately .
you miss that , don &apos;t you ?
my father was a rabid untouchables fan .
make of that what you will .
what , elliot ?
i ran into nancy duggan last week .
do you know nancy duggan ?
vaguely .
she &apos;s on staff at rikers lsland ,
works with a lot of sociopaths , as you can imagine .
anyway , she told me something interesting .
a lot of studies about talk therapy
as it relates to sociopaths
and criminals ,
one of them is the criminal personality conducted
by yochelson at st elizabeth &apos;s .
essentially
it concludes that
talk therapy ,
while not only being useless with sociopaths ,
actually serves to validate them .
yochelson says
they sharpen their skills as conmen on their therapists .
crocodile tears , what have you .
why are you smirking ?
i &apos;m not .
really ?
we showed data .
the one @-@ year reconviction rates
were higher for offenders in therapy
than for those receiving no treatment at all .
some peppers and cheese .
gorgonzola , all right ? don &apos;t forget .
sit down .
easy .
you motherfucker . my fucking daughter ?
my fucking daughter , you motherfucker .
want some sambuca with this ?
tony , you &apos;re making a big fucking mistake here .
how about i put a bullet in your fucking head ?
don &apos;t do it !
you want some ?
it &apos;s always what you think , isn &apos;t it ?
it &apos;s never how i feel .
poor you .
it &apos;s all your mother &apos;s fault , isn &apos;t it ?
i didn &apos;t say that .
you &apos;re a mama &apos;s boy .
you &apos;re gonna call me names now ?
no one is calling anyone any names .
how about my confirmation ?
you called me an animal .
i did not !
i was in the garage and you said ,
&quot; what kind of animal smokes marijuana at his confirmation ? &quot;
he was using illegal drugs in the home .
did it ever occur to you that i might have been self @-@ medicating ?
give me a break , will you ?
and how about second grade ?
you made me show up to school in that dorky raincoat .
i got beat up because of it .
you would hole up in that room for hours .
because i was never really secure expressing my feelings in that house .
i mean , that &apos;s why .
what kind of poem is that to teach college students ?
would you like to tell your parents
what your grandmother said ?
my mother ?
grandma . dad &apos;s mom .
what did she say ?
that it &apos;s all a big nothing .
what is ? -
life .
that was her , all right .
ok , fine , she said those kinds of things .
she sat up in bed
when she could hardly move .
she could hardly breathe .
she said in the end that your friends and family let you down ,
and that you die in your own arms .
when was this ?
when she was in that nursing home
and you made me go see her .
we &apos;re not too young to be grandpas .
tone ?
carmine lupertazzi .
i &apos;ll see you later , skip .
all right .
we should have dinner , you know ,
carm , donna , maybe the kids .
yeah .
i hear wedding bells are in the air .
you want anything ?
no , i &apos;m good .
if there &apos;s anything i can do , tony , for anthony jr .
thank you .
when alexandra had that bout of anorexia ,
we had this terrific psychologist .
she tried to kill herself , your daughter ?
no .
she had serious problems , though , didn &apos;t she ?
not really . it &apos;s all under control .
so ,
the reason i &apos;m here ,
you could probably guess .
what happened at coco &apos;s restaurant .
this alteration you had with him ,
you &apos;re at the precipice , tony ,
of an enormous crossroad .
phil &apos;s considering shutting down the hackensack mall project
with a plumbing strike as we speak .
fuck it . let him .
easy for you . i have the scaffolding contract .
is that what this is about , carmine ?
what do i owe you ?
come on . you know me better than that .
my daughter , carmine . my daughter .
you got a little girl .
you almost killed the guy .
i should have killed him . i &apos;d have had total support
but i held myself back .
you were being prudent .
fuck that .
i lost it .
timing couldn &apos;t have been worse , but what the fuck ?
so you go to phil ,
i go with you , hats in hand ,
bended knees .
why me ?
doesn &apos;t every parent make mistakes ?
why not you ?
cos i &apos;m a good guy ,
basically .
i love my family .
there &apos;s a balance . there &apos;s a ying and a yang .
you think you know . you think you learned something .
like when i got shot .
know what ?
all right .
when i was in las vegas , i took peyote .
curiosity , i don &apos;t know .
you were searching for something .
well , i saw some things . not things per se ,
hallucinations ,
roger corman shit .
there wasn &apos;t any of that .
what was there ?
it &apos;s kind of hard to describe .
you &apos;ve done it , right ? acid , shit like that .
no .
all i can say is
i saw , for pretty certain ,
that this ,
everything we see and experience ,
is not all there is .
what else is there ?
something else .
but that &apos;s as far as i &apos;m gonna go with it .
i don &apos;t fucking know .
alternate universes ?
you gonna be a fucking comedian now ?
i &apos;m not .
maybe .
this is gonna sound stupid ,
but i saw at one point that our mothers are ...
they &apos;re bus drivers .
no , they are the bus .
see , they &apos;re the vehicle that gets us here .
they drop us off and go on their way .
they continue on their journey .
and the problem is that we keep trying to get back on the bus
instead of just letting it go .
that &apos;s very insightful .
jesus , don &apos;t act so surprised .
you know ,
you have these thoughts and you almost grab it .
and then ...
butch , how are you ?
phil is not accepting visitors right now .
i just talked to him on the phone .
i just talked to him in person .
he ain &apos;t seeing nobody .
what &apos;s going on , butch ?
i just brokered this thing .
he came here to make a peace offering .
a semi @-@ trailer of drills , makitas .
we don &apos;t want your fucking drills .
fuck it .
let &apos;s go .
that &apos;s right , cocksucker !
go back to new jersey !
phil , what are you doing ?
take that piece of shit and get off my stoop .
but we just talked about this .
well , cooler heads prevailed .
uncle philly .
uncle philly , my ass .
will you just come down so we can discuss this ?
there &apos;s nothing left to discuss , carmine .
