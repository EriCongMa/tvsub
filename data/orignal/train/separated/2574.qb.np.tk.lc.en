connecting trains to the orange and blue line . at farragut street .
bergman &apos;s , right ?
the store where you bought your hat .
oh , yeah .
i didn &apos;t -- i didn &apos;t leave the tag on , did i ?
no .
i walk by there every day on my way home .
i saw the hat in the display window ,
and i knew i had to get it for my dad .
but in gray . gray &apos;s his thing .
that &apos;s very thoughtful .
next stop , woodley park .
when &apos;s the last time you saw him ?
sunday .
we both go to st. patrick &apos;s episcopal .
good . that &apos;s good .
woodley park .
it was nice to meet you .
you , too .
please allow passengers to exit before boarding the train .
sir , you forgot your briefcase !
sir , you forgot your briefcase !
what the hell ?
i can &apos;t breathe .
are-- are you okay ?
call 9 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 .
miss , are you okay ?
please help me ! please , i need help !
please !
47号
what is this ?
café au lait--
unless you like the dark nut better .
but don &apos;t decide yet .
i &apos;m sorry . let &apos;s start over .
why is our dining room no longer dine @-@ able ?
we &apos;re remodeling .
clearly , and we &apos;re doing it at 7 : 00 a.m.
well , the guy at the hardware store said
to hang the samples in the morning
so that you can see what they look like throughout the day .
what do you think ?
i like this one .
grandma &apos;s pumpkins ?
grandma &apos;s what ?
i know it &apos;s ridiculous .
oh , i &apos;m just so sick of this room .
why ? i like this room .
it &apos;s not the room .
it &apos;s just that someone invaded our lives , our house .
they put that stupid box in the floor .
it doesn &apos;t matter anymore .
they made me believe you were a monster .
i doubted you .
i doubted us .
yeah , we &apos;re past it .
we &apos;re gonna be fine .
and i don &apos;t think that we need to destroy the dining room .
i think that we just need --
to move ?
i was gonna say we need time ,
but , uh , it &apos;s good to know where your head &apos;s at .
keen .
turn on the tv .
babe , can you turn the tv on ?
what channel ?
any channel .
地铁爆炸案嫌疑犯
this is the scene at d.c. &apos; s red line station .
details are still sketchy ,
but rescue teams and emergency personnel
are arriving on the ...
lady ! you can &apos;t park here !
hey , officer ! she &apos;s with me .
what do we got ?
appears to be a biological attack on the red line .
how many dead ?
37 .
no survivors on the train car .
agent ressler !
agent ressler ,
uh , we got something you should probably see .
the transit authority gave us access
to their closed @-@ circuit feeds .
what am i looking at here ?
a man carrying a briefcase .
he boards the train at dupont circle .
four minutes elapse .
the same man exits the train
at the next station , woodley park .
he &apos;s not carrying the briefcase .
he left it on the train .
and moments later , at precisely 6 : 42 a.m ...
i think we found our delivery device .
i &apos;ll radio the evidence team .
i reached out to my contacts at the agency .
central intelligence or national security ?
both .
what &apos;d you find out ?
nothing . but that in itself has some value .
there was absolutely zero foreign chatter
prior to the attack on the red line .
地铁爆炸案嫌疑人
so , you think this was homegrown ?
if i had to put money on it ,
which i wouldn &apos;t , yes .
where are we on that briefcase ?
i reached out to cdc ,
but they denied our request to release it as evidence .
why ?
because it tested positive
for trace amounts of radioactive material .
we &apos;ll have to wait on decontamination protocols .
excuse me .
we &apos;ve got a caller into the tip line .
the person claims they can i.d. our suspect .
this is special agent keen .
agent keen , i have a tip .
you &apos;re a winter , not an autumn .
stop wearing olive .
you know , i don &apos;t have time for this .
you &apos;re not the one who had to listen
to that god @-@ awful hold music for 7 minutes ,
which wouldn &apos;t have been necessary if you &apos;d take my calls .
it &apos;s a little snug . don &apos;t you think , martin ?
you know , as much as i love our little talks ,
you &apos;re holding up a line
for people that might have actual information .
this isn &apos;t a social call .
i can identify the man you &apos;re looking for , lizzy .
okay . who is he ?
phones are so impersonal .
why don &apos;t we meet for show and tell in 30 minutes ?
dembe will forward you a location .
if you care to hear me out , wonderful .
otherwise , good luck with your case .
the man you &apos;re looking for is named frederick barnes ,
a former defense research scientist
out of arpax systems in annapolis .
you may not be familiar with his name ,
but you &apos;re likely familiar with his work --
biochemical agents such as cytochlorin ,
black phosphorus , paratoxin .
barnes headed the project team that developed all of them ,
but he was more than just a research scientist .
he was gifted ,
a savant of government @-@ sanctioned mass killing .
what do you mean , &quot; was &quot; ?
five years ago , the man quit his job ,
sold his house , and entered the free market .
started selling his creations to the highest bidder --
autocrats , terrorists , me .
betraying your country and auctioning off its secrets .
where have i heard that before ?
you want to compare him to me ?
be my guest .
i &apos;m perfectly comfortable with what i am .
but , please , make no mistake --
frederick barnes is a very special animal ,
one with the tools and know @-@ how
to kill thousands and thousands of people all at once .
what he &apos;s lacked until now has been the desire .
so , what &apos;s changed ?
well , that &apos;s the question .
barnes has always operated with a certain level of detachment --
always the designer , the seller ,
never the delivery agent of his own weapons .
but if barnes is now willing to use his work
to kill indiscriminately ,
then he is , quite literally ,
the most dangerous man in the world .
hey , dr.buckman.
we &apos;ve managed to i.d. 31 of the victims so far .
the other 6 presented
with pseudoaneurysm of the internal maxillary artery ,
making them unrecognizable .
can you translate for the medically challenged ?
the arteries in their face exploded .
that was the cause of death ?
it was just a symptom of the larger condition --
kurz disease is what killed them .
oh , i &apos;ve never heard of it .
no one has .
it &apos;s a vascular disorder , extremely rare .
causes the veins and arteries to harden
until the body &apos;s starved of oxygen .
odd thing is , it usually takes about a decade
for this disease to run its full course .
in this case , it took two minutes .
either of you eat lunch yet ?
no .
good .
follow me .
children ?
his name is ryan demsky , 9 years old .
he was here on vacation with his dad
from st. paul , minnesota .
you said this disease is rare .
how rare ?
in the last 5 years ,
there have been a handful of kurz infections worldwide .
we &apos;ve seen almost 600 new cases since july ,
which seems impossible ,
since the virus isn &apos;t particularly contagious .
unless someone was intentionally spreading it .
that &apos;s the conclusion we came to , as well .
a few months back , atlanta opened up an investigation
tracking large infection clusters .
our suspect has a background
in biological and chemical warfare .
is it possible that he weaponized this disease
and somehow modified it to make it more lethal ?
technically ? sure .
but he &apos;d be operating on the frontiers of fringe science .
one thing &apos;s clear , though .
your man has access .
access to what ?
strontium 90 , a radioactive isotope .
we found traces of it on the delivery device .
he probably used it as an immunosuppressant .
strontium 90 isn &apos;t something
you can just pick up at your local piggly wiggly .
it &apos;s a waste by @-@ product of nuclear reactors --
toxic , highly regulated .
there &apos;s only a handful of people in the world
who can procure it in sizable quantities .
let me guess -- you happen to know one of them .
actually , i happen to know three them --
the first of whom was apprehended
by russian authorities last month .
the second , vaporized by a drone in quetta ,
courtesy of your colleagues in the five @-@ sided foxhole .
and the third ?
is likely barnes &apos; supplier .
cut to it -- i want a name .
i &apos;m afraid it wouldn &apos;t do you any good .
the fbi has no jurisdiction where he operates .
in any case ,
i &apos;ve already set a meeting with him for this afternoon .
and what makes you think he knows how to find barnes ?
he knows how to get paid by him . that should be sufficient .
and he &apos;s just gonna willingly hand over this information ?
we &apos;ll cross that bridge when we get there , donald .
look , we &apos;re wasting precious time .
you want to catch a mass murderer
before he strikes again ,
and for that to happen , i need to catch a plane .
you should come , lizzy .
we could have a therapy session on the way ,
talk out our problems .
have you ever been to cuba ?
i &apos;m sorry .
all my tropical wear &apos;s in the wash .
you &apos;d look positively radiant in a guayabera dress .
i know a little shop in reston .
we could stop before our flight .
there is no &quot; our flight . &quot;
you have something more pressing than finding your suspect ?
actually , i was able to track down
barnes &apos; old research partner ,
so i &apos;m hoping she can fill in some of the missing pieces .
so , i guess you &apos;re on your own .
i &apos;m sorry you &apos;re upset with me .
that would imply i care enough to be angry .
i might do the same in your position .
it &apos;s easier to blame me for framing your husband
than face the truth of what he is .
tom teaches 4th grade .
he &apos;s overworked and underpaid
and still wakes up every morning with a smile on his face .
you know why ?
because he knows nothing
of the terrible world you and i live in .
end of story .
oh , that &apos;s not the end of the story .
i &apos;m confident you &apos;ll come to see that .
but in the meantime ,
we need to find a way to move past this .
because for me ,
there &apos;s just no fun in it unless you &apos;re there .
and if there &apos;s no fun to be had , i &apos;m not interested .
we should probably get going
if you want to make havana by noon .
quick , say something nice to me .
it &apos;s been a dreadful morning .
would good news suffice ?
you wanted to know if it ever went on the market ?
is it really for sale ?
i take that to mean
you &apos;d like me to move forward with the purchase ?
perhaps this day can be salvaged after all .
mrs. forrester ? special agents keen and ressler .
we &apos;d like to talk to you about frederick barnes .
he was brilliant , ahead of his time .
he -- he was a rising star at -- at work .
i @-@ i was never quite sure why he decided to leave .
were you aware of any problems barnes may have been having
at work or in his personal life ?
what personal life ? we worked 16 @-@ hour days .
oh , that &apos;s an understatement .
he practically had an living in that lab .
he --
frederick was obsessive .
every research problem was like a puzzle that he had to solve .
when did you last speak with him ?
five years ago ?
last i heard , he was taking a teaching job at purdue .
is he in some kind of trouble ?
hey , buddy . this is our son , ethan .
is it okay if i go over to caleb &apos;s ?
do me a favor . not right now . go upstairs .
i &apos;ll be right up , okay , sweetie ? go . thank you .
do you have any contact info for barnes ?
even an old phone number could help .
yeah , i might have something in the kitchen .
i need to ask you a personal question about your son .
does he have kurz disease ?
yeah . how did you know that ?
because i just saw dozens of corpses
infected with a weaponized variant of the disease .
barnes released it on the red line this morning .
he killed 37 people , including a 9 @-@ year @-@ old child .
and i have a hard time believing the coincidence
that your son is infected with the same disease
your former research partner is now using to commit mass murder .
so , if there &apos;s something you &apos;re holding back ,
now would be a good time to re @-@ evaluate that decision .
frederick is ethan &apos;s father .
does your husband know this ?
it just happened .
i thought it was best for the family to keep the secret .
does frederick know he &apos;s ethan &apos;s real father ?
yeah .
when ethan was 5 , he -- he developed kurz ,
and they -- they told us it was untreatable .
frederick wouldn &apos;t accept that .
he had contacts in the pharmaceutical industry .
he reached out to them
to secure research funding into the disease ,
but everyone turned him down .
why ?
kurz is too rare .
small disease means small profits .
that &apos;s why barnes is killing .
he wants to infect enough people with kurz disease
that it gets on the public &apos;s radar .
why ?
because then it can &apos;t be ignored anymore .
the more people that die ,
the more attention the disease gets .
and the more profitable it will be to invest research dollars .
putting aside how insane this sounds ,
if you &apos;re right , barnes is just getting started .
good afternoon .
good afternoon .
ahh , gracias .
gracias .
manny , as always , you look like hell .
says the devil himself .
come here .
so , what brings you to my neck of the woods , gringo ?
just you , manny . it &apos;s all you .
let &apos;s talk about strontium 90 .
strontium 90 ? of course that &apos;s what you want .
because you can &apos;t want drugs or qassam rockets
like anyone else .
a qassam rocket is a fertilizer @-@ filled trash can .
i wouldn &apos;t fire that eyesore at my worst enemy .
how much do you need ?
12 kilos .
what exactly are you going to do
with 12 kilograms of strontium 90 ?
bueno .
i &apos;ve secured the funds on the purchase .
i &apos;m ready to proceed on red &apos;s word .
good . i &apos;ll let him know once he &apos;s done with soto .
excellent .
$ 6 million . i need three weeks .
i need it now .
not possible .
fresh out , i &apos;m afraid .
then perhaps i could get in touch with your previous buyer
and make them an offer instead .
are you threatening to cut me out of my own business ?
because we &apos;re not that good of friends .
what , are they gonna pull their guns
and hold them all sideways at me ?
manny , i &apos;m sure we can come
to a mutually beneficial arrangement .
i &apos;m listening .
reach out to your buyer ,
convince them to sell back some of their purchase to you
at a premium .
what kind of premium ?
my client will put up $ 10 million
for immediate delivery ,
with a hefty transaction fee for yourself , of course .
did he take the bait ?
like a trout to a butterworm .
he should be calling barnes any minute .
call &apos;s going through now .
good , run the trace .
what do you need ?
a bottle of beer and a pork sandwich .
how about you ? what do you need ?
how about barnes &apos; location ?
地区总法院
sir ?
are you with group 33 ?
yes .
i was actually hoping to reschedule my jury service .
i &apos;ll need your summons .
yes .
you know what ? i think i left it in my car .
i &apos;ll be right back .
cooper .
red got us a 20 on barnes .
where is he ?
the courthouse in arlington . we &apos;re on our way in now .
federal agents ! federal agent !
fbi ! move ! move ! move !
take the north stairwell . i &apos;ve got the second floor .
all right , everyone . single file .
your tax dollars at work .
help !
somebody help us !
federal agent , fbi .
i &apos;m gonna need your tanks and your mask .
i need you to evacuate everyone in this hallway
and get everybody out of here now , including yourself . go !
stop ! fbi !
help me , please !
somebody , help !
it &apos;s okay . it &apos;s okay . it &apos;s okay . stop ! stop ! stop !
we &apos;re gonna get help . i &apos;ve got you . come on .
out !
out of the way !
move !
freeze !
i &apos;m only gonna say this once -- drop the gun .
you first . i &apos;m gonna count to 3 .
if that gun is not on the ground , i will shoot this man .
and you will be dead one second after .
1 , 2 , 3 !
you don &apos;t have to do this !
all right ! all right !
drop the gun and kick it away .
drop the gun ! now !
let him go .
cindy wright . you must be lew .
is that short for louise ?
no . thanks for meeting me on such short notice .
oh , not a problem .
as i &apos;m sure my assistant told you on the phone ,
the house is in escrow .
we &apos;re only accepting backup offers .
i understand .
why don &apos;t we head inside ?
i &apos;ll give you a tour of the property .
oh , that won &apos;t be necessary .
my client &apos;s prepared to make an offer .
double the asking price ... in cash .
i &apos;m sure you can find a fair commission for yourself --
assuming your escrow falls through , that is .
i just got off the phone with dr. buckner .
she &apos;s coordinating triage teams at d.c. general .
how bad ?
26 confirmed dead ,
but it looks like the attack was contained to the jury room .
and your survivor ?
too soon to tell .
but given her level of exposure ,
dr. buckner &apos;s not optimistic .
what have you got ?
casualty lists .
i keep asking myself , &quot; how is barnes choosing his targets ? &quot;
and that got me thinking --
a courthouse and public transportation .
what do these two things have in common ?
they &apos;re both managed by the state .
right , but more importantly ,
they both contain random groupings of people --
various ages , genders , ethnicities .
i &apos;m not sure i follow .
well , it seems like barnes is targeting
large cross sections of the population .
you don &apos;t get a more random sample than a jury pool .
so ... barnes wants to kill different types of people ?
i don &apos;t know .
is it possible these aren &apos;t just attacks ?
could barnes be conducting
some kind of demonstration or experiment ?
agent keen ? a word .
you &apos;re on duty , correct ?
are you carrying your badge ?
of course .
why ?
because it &apos;s protocol .
then would you care to explain
why you would surrender your firearm to a suspect
in the middle of a hostage situation ?
it was a judgment call .
barnes was going to kill that officer .
i realize you &apos;re new at this , agent keen ,
but some rules don &apos;t have exceptions .
and giving up your weapon ,
that happens to be top of the list .
i am fully aware of our field regulations .
and since you willfully ignored them ,
your actions will be subject to a formal review .
what does that mean ?
it means an administrative panel will decide
whether or not you &apos;ll be sanctioned .
and we &apos;ll see where we go from there .
you mind telling me what the hell that was ?
if you &apos;re asking whether i reported you ,
the answer is yes .
why would you do that ?
look , keen .
i like you . i respect you .
but that moment back there with barnes
showed me that you &apos;re unqualified to be in the field .
you would &apos;ve taken the shot ? is that it ?
it &apos;s easy to make the tough call after the fact , isn &apos;t it ?
it &apos;s what any trained field agent would &apos;ve done ,
which is precisely the point .
and that hostage would be dead .
then i guess that &apos;s just what happens .
that &apos;s a man &apos;s life you &apos;re talking about .
yes .
one man &apos;s ,
which you traded for hundreds , possibly thousands ,
by letting barnes get away .
and if you can &apos;t understand why that &apos;s a bad call ,
you don &apos;t belong in a tactical unit .
you &apos;re a very lucky girl .
please tell me that &apos;s the last one .
the last one , i promise .
what are the tests gonna tell us ?
whether you have any infection in your body .
what happened to those people at the courthouse ,
is that gonna happen to me ?
not if i can help it , sweetheart .
you just hang tight , okay ?
if you &apos;re here for more blood , i &apos;m pretty tapped .
nothing that exciting , i &apos;m afraid .
i &apos;m just here to change out your i.v. bag .
how are you feeling ?
a little , um ...
light @-@ headed .
by there you accidentally dial the wrong number you &apos;re calling
because you hit the dead end .
so , which is it ?
barnes got away , and the trail &apos;s dried up .
you g @-@ men are top shelf .
let me guess .
ressler slipped on a banana peel ?
do you know how to find him ?
i &apos;m not a gumball machine , lizzy .
you don &apos;t get to just twist the handle
whenever you want a treat .
we can &apos;t keep doing this little waltz .
don &apos;t hang up .
i &apos;m listening .
the reason barnes is still out there
is because i let him slip away .
and it &apos;s only a matter of time before he kills again .
so , please , i need your help .
ah , music to my ears .
what was that last part again ?
i need your help .
all you had to do was ask .
i saw in the coverage
there was a survivor from the arlington attack .
you should assume barnes knows that , as well .
which means what ?
has he been to see her yet ?
uh , no .
are you sure ?
why would he ?
barnes may be a scientist , but he &apos;s also a killer .
and in that line of work ,
a survivor is considered unfinished business .
maybe we beat him to it .
or maybe red was wrong .
what &apos;s going on ?
we have reason to believe ms. rubin is in danger .
from what ? !
ms. rubin ? elisa ?
who &apos;s had access to this room ?
just dr. buckner and the nurse .
lock down the hospital . no one gets in or out .
i want every single employee identified .
is she okay ?
help me with her .
what is that ?
looks like a bone marrow biopsy wound .
i didn &apos;t authorize this procedure .
you were right about barnes .
they weren &apos;t just attacks . they were experiments .
he was searching for someone
with a natural immunity for kurz disease .
you mean like elisa rubin ?
that &apos;s why she survived the attack .
her test results just came back .
she has zero sign of infection .
so , he &apos;s going to use this genetic immunity
to synthesize an antidote ,
then , if barnes believes he has the cure ...
he &apos;s going for the boy .
come on . come on .
hello ? mrs. forrester ,
this is special agent keen .
i need you to listen to me very carefully .
is your son , ethan , with you ?
uh , yeah . why ? is something wrong ?
take your son and get out of your house immediately .
we have reason to believe that frederick barnes is on his way .
i need you to get ethan to a safe place .
anne !
anne , are you there ?
what are you doing here ?
we need to talk .
mrs. forrester ?
the police are already on their way .
well , then , i don &apos;t have a lot of time .
please , i need to see ethan .
it &apos;s true , isn &apos;t it ?
what happened to all those people on the subway ...
it was you .
i did ... what i had to do for our son .
and you &apos;ll understand soon enough .
no . get out of our house .
anne ...
stay away from him !
anne ! no !
ethan . don &apos;t be scared .
i &apos;m ... a friend , and i know you haven &apos;t been well .
and i &apos;m here to help you .
but i need you to trust me .
can you do that ? can you trust me ?
ethan ?
no , ethan ! ethan !
ethan , it &apos;s okay ! ethan !
no ! no ! no !
ethan ! i &apos;m not gonna hurt you .
just relax and breathe . it &apos;s okay .
anne , we &apos;re here .
step away from him !
i can &apos;t do that .
i think you &apos;re probably well aware of that by now .
i know what you think you have in that needle .
yes , my son &apos;s future .
your cure is experimental .
it could just as easily kill him .
if i do nothing , he dies anyway .
you don &apos;t know that .
yes , i do .
there &apos;s no other treatment .
there &apos;s no universe
in which i let you stick that thing in his neck .
this ... is his chance .
this is the only chance that he &apos;ll ever have .
and i don &apos;t think you &apos;re gonna stop me .
ethan ?
ethan ?
what are you doing here ?
i brought you a souvenir .
what &apos;s your feeling about guava ?
anxiety .
oh , you &apos;re in for a treat .
i take it from the coroner &apos;s van
that barnes is no longer with us .
pity .
tell that to the families of the people he murdered .
every cause has more than one effect .
say what you will about frederick ,
but someone who &apos;s willing to burn the world down
to protect the one person they care about ...
that &apos;s a man i understand .
is that meant to be directed at me ?
aren &apos;t you presumptuous ?
is that how you somehow justify your actions ,
by some misguided notion of protecting me ?
from whom ?
my husband , i suppose .
i don &apos;t need your protection .
maybe not .
but i do need you to do this job .
i &apos;ve accepted that .
and believe it or not ,
i appreciate what you do for the bureau .
and at work , you and i are partners .
but that &apos;s where this relationship needs to end --
at work .
i don &apos;t want you in my personal life .
i don &apos;t know how to make that clear .
you know the problem with drawing lines in the sand ?
with a breath of air , they disappear .
you may not like me .
you may not understand how or why i do what i do .
but i &apos;m here because you want answers to questions
you haven &apos;t even thought of yet .
now , if that doesn &apos;t matter to you ,
the solution is simple --
i get in this car and i disappear .
you have a deal with the government .
you have a tracking device in your neck .
you don &apos;t believe raymond reddington
could cease to exist in 60 seconds ?
i offer that particular package to clients .
you &apos;re offering to walk away ?
i &apos;m not going to beg you
to allow me the privilege of helping you .
so , say the word , and i &apos;m gone .
tell me to go , lizzy .
then i guess i &apos;ll see you tomorrow .
hard to believe ,
but i &apos;m just about finished up here .
yeah , i &apos;m done .
that was a difficult call you made with barnes .
would &apos;ve been tough for anyone in that position .
i keep going over that moment in my head ,
wondering what would &apos;ve happened
if i &apos;d just let him go through with it .
given what we know ,
that drug was probably the real thing .
what made you do it ?
because you were right . barnes needed to be stopped .
and if the cure &apos;s genuine ,
it &apos;ll be vetted through the proper channels .
if it &apos;s too late for ethan by then ?
then i guess that &apos;s just what happens .
what is this ?
we &apos;re remodeling .
clearly .
long day ?
you have no idea .
it &apos;s killing you , isn &apos;t it ?
did you really get rid of all our stuff ?
do you seriously not remember ?
what ?
wow , okay . it was friday night .
we &apos;d just driven in from rochester
and picked up the keys to this place ,
but our furniture wasn &apos;t coming until sunday .
so , we drove to the store , and we got ike .
oh , yeah , the lamp .
remember , that &quot; a &quot; was scratched off the finish ?
poor guy was in the clearance bin .
and on the way back ,
we stopped at that little chinese place and got takeout .
that was our first night in this place .
yeah . that &apos;s all we had .
it &apos;s all we ever needed .
just you , me , and ike .
strange .
i remember it being bigger .
i don &apos;t understand . of all the places --
marigot , doha , florence , seychelles --
why this place ?
i raised my family in this house .
it &apos;s lovely .
no , it &apos;s not , but it used to be .
time to go .
did you prepare everything the way i asked ?
this place must hold a lot of memories for you .
i spend every day trying to forget what happened here .
this should help .
