what &apos;s up , honolulu ?
let &apos;s light this candle .
hey , folks , welcome to the bobby raines show .
i am the aforementioned bobby raines ,
as most of you know ,
just a note , if you &apos;re gonna send me fan mail ,
don &apos;t put your name on the front in crayon
&apos;cause i &apos;m not opening it .
that &apos;s all i need to do
is find some rabbit pellets in there , and i got hantavirus .
thank you .
five miles offshore today on the snark ark
&apos;cause i &apos;m not going onshore .
i refuse to do it .
i cannot go into the city anymore .
i &apos;m sorry .
the kids in that occupy movement driving me
absolutely crazy when i go by .
to me , it appears to break down
into two main groups , uncle fester .
you got the wide @-@ eyed stoner kid
who &apos;s hitting the gecko bong more frequently
than one of bob marley &apos;s kids at a phish concert
or else you have the disaffected rich kid who &apos;s gonna show my dad
that i &apos;m not part of the whole machine .
and you walk in his shoes .
you walk in his shoes .
i &apos;ve just had enough .
so what are you trying to say , bobby ?
what i &apos;m saying is : it &apos;s over .
it &apos;s time to zamboni off the loser ice
and get these kids out of there .
one man saving the world
as we know it is another man &apos;s vagrancy .
and at this point , i only see you as squatters who apparently
don &apos;t know squat , all right ?
we &apos;ve had enough of it , kids .
time to go home now .
get back in the basement , okay ?
and , you know , they always hit me
with &quot; well , you don &apos;t have any compassion
for the common man . &quot;
wow , you kidding me ?
i want to help the helpless .
i don &apos;t want to help the clueless .
and you have officially lapsed over
into clueless , my friend .
listen , you &apos;re looking back on times
that weren &apos;t even hip when they were hip .
woodstock was a mud hole with no cell coverage .
all right , my man ?
you &apos;re a dreamer . you are a rebel
without a clue .
and i &apos;m sorry
to blow your mind , little silver surfer .
but guess what ?
it &apos;s a time in history
when your mind deserves to be blown .
come on , monkey ! come on down !
all right , you &apos;re splashing .
grace , i &apos;m waiting here ! come on !
don &apos;t wave . come on !
you &apos;re safe
let &apos;s do it again
so what &apos;d you do ?
you made a new friend today ?
no , that was dylan from school .
his mom works here .
dylan , huh ?
yeah , he &apos;s the funniest boy in school .
i bet he &apos;s a regular chris rock .
who ?
all right , listen to me , all right ?
i &apos;m gonna tell you something , i want you to pay attention .
i &apos;ve told you before
you gotta be careful around boys , understand ?
danno ...
no , no , no , listen .
you can &apos;t trust all boys . you just can &apos;t .
they , uh , they have , uh ...
what ?
they have motives .
they got motives .
now , listen , i don &apos;t want to scare you
and make you think that all boys are evil , okay ?
but this kid ...
he &apos;s just a friend .
he &apos;s evil , all right ? i said it . he &apos;s evil .
all right ? understand me ?
that boy &apos;s not good .
nod your head if you understand .
i love you . come on .
hey , didn &apos;t you go to the pool at the hilton today ?
yeah , i did , yeah . and grace loved it . good .
maybe a little bit too much .
you want to talk about it ?
no , i don &apos;t want to talk about it .
what &apos;s , uh , what &apos;s with all the rubberneckers ?
our vic , bobby raines .
the radio guy ?
yeah .
oh , man .
you know this guy ?
yeah , man , raines .
he was a comedic genius .
he used to have a show back in new york .
i used to listen to it all the time .
i &apos;m sorry , man .
what do we know ?
all right , so s.i.s. is still processing , but it &apos;s looking
like some type of an explosion .
like an equipment malfunction ?
more like a bomb .
what about his family ? they been notified ?
he &apos;s divorced . he &apos;s got a daughter .
used to talk about her all the time .
yeah , chin &apos;s tracking her down now .
she definitely doesn &apos;t need to see this , so please
keep her away from here , okay ?
yeah , yeah .
this charge was directional .
they used low explosive .
it was nota mass detonation device .
this charge was meant
to kill whoever was sitting in front of it .
a directional hit would be consistent
with the injuries .
our victim sustained massive hemorrhaging
and lacerations to the chest cavity and head .
he died instantly .
who was in this room , max ?
his producer .
he was hit by the backblast , wasn &apos;t he ?
that is correct .
but his injuries were minor
due to the fact he was not in the broadcast booth .
we should go find him .
you &apos;re extremely lucky you weren &apos;t in that booth
when that bomb went off .
it came close .
i was headed in there on the next commercial .
i can &apos;t believe bobby &apos;s dead .
i &apos;m sorry , man .
listen , besides you ,
who else had access to that soundboard ?
no one .
we were a two @-@ man operation .
i produced ; bobby was the voice .
okay . anybody else you could think of
have access to the yacht ?
here when we &apos;re docked ?
me , bobby , yacht club security .
nobody got in or out without a keycard .
miles , can you think of anybody
who &apos;d want to do something like this ?
look , bobby completely rewrote the rule book
on what you could do in radio .
and he &apos;d speak his mind.some people didn &apos;t like it .
i thought he came here to retire .
yeah , he did ,
but a guy like raines ,
he &apos;s only happy when he &apos;s behind the mike .
he had all the money in the world ,
but he missed his acolytes .
acolytes ?
that &apos;s what he called his fans .
okay , so let me get this straight .
bobby gets tired of living the good life ,
he picks up the mike and starts his show back up , right ?
yeah . it was a total pirate operation .
bobby-- he buys up the signal ; we air when we want to .
and our ratings--they were sky @-@ high .
i mean , we were smoking the competition with static .
with static ?
yeah . he didn &apos;t keep a regular schedule ,
so his die @-@ hard fans --they &apos;d keep their dials tuned in
to raines &apos; station so they wouldn &apos;t miss him .
it &apos;s gone ! it &apos;s gone ! wait .
breathe . what are you talking about ?
raines &apos; body-- it &apos;s gone !
what do you mean , it &apos;s gone ?
somebody stole my van
with the body in it !
okay , first of all , please slow down , okay ?
we don &apos;t even know which way they went .
this road is the only way out of the marina .
easy , please !
easy , speed racer , huh ?
actually , this vehicle was engineered
to be driven in this manner .
would you stop it ? you &apos;re not helping !
commander , i am personally responsible for that body ,
so hammer down if you will .
kono , this is not a good time .
you &apos;re interrupting vehicular manslaughter .
you &apos;re chasing the morgue van , right ? -how &apos;d you know that ?
a couple of raines &apos; fans took the body .
they &apos;re live @-@ tweeting everything , and i &apos;m tracking them through their phones .
okay , finally , the internet is good for something .
where are these idiots ?
get over to aloha tower .
you &apos;ll be able to cut &apos; em off there .
there it is !
hey , hands on the wheel ! on the wheel !
hey , you , you , get out of the car .
hands behind your head .
interlock your fingers.hands behind your back .
interlock your fingers.against the hood .
against the hood here .
the body &apos;s still here ! he &apos;s okay !
you mean , aside from the fact
that he &apos;s dead , right , max ?
okay , so let me get this straight :
you guys stole the body
&apos;cause you &apos;re big bobby rainesfans , is that right ?
not fans .
acolytes , dude .
&quot; dude &quot; ?
yeah.sir.
so where exactly were you planning on taking this body ?
we were gonna fly him to the big island ...
... and toss him in the kilauea volcano .
wait a minute . you were gonna fly him commercially ?
kind of weekend at bernie &apos;s style ?
okay , well , that is without question
the stupidest thing i have ever heard in my entire life .
i second that .
get these guys out of here .
tell me , brandi .
did your father get any threats recently ?
no . i mean , there were always the crazy acolytes ,
people who hated what he said ,
but we grew up like that .
you get used to it .
could he have been worried about something at work ?
he never talked about work when we were together .
how was his relationship with his producer miles rogers ?
they were like brothers .
moved here from new york together .
all right .
so no change in your father &apos;s routine or behavior recently ?
tell him about the gun .
a gun ?
about a month ago
my father took me with him to buy a gun .
did he say what he was worried about ?
no , i just remember it being odd
&apos;cause my father was anti @-@ gun his whole life .
he got one for brandi , too .
he said he wanted me to be able to protect myself .
and he never said why ?
do you think he knew someone was trying to kill him ?
that &apos;s what we &apos;re gonna find out .
all right , good .
see you back at the shop .
all right , so get this .
turns out that raines was getting a little jumpy recently ,
was gearing up for bear ,
got himself a gun and one for his daughter .
did chin say there was a threat ?
uh , the daughter didn &apos;t know of anything specific .
so , what , he just runs out and joins the nra ?
well , maybe he &apos;s just a worried father looking out
for his helpless , defenseless , and very innocent little girl .
listen , don &apos;t give me a look .
okay , i would be very content knowing
that grace had a stun gun in her back pocket at all times .
there are very many unsavory characters
roaming around this rock .
why don &apos;t you tell me what happened at the hilton today ?
nothing happened at the hilton .
&apos;cause you seem upset to me .
you became a shrink all of a sudden ?
yeah , and you can take a seat in the back there ,
uh , if you &apos;d be more comfortable lying down .
or you can stay where you &apos;re sitting
and tell me what happened , because either way ,
i &apos;m gonna keep asking you , so it &apos;s up to you .
okay , sigmund , you want to know what &apos;s bothering me ?
it &apos;s your hour .
okay , i &apos;ll tell you .
today by the pool ,
there was this very , very creepy , creepy child .
okay .
i mean , real , real malcontent .
mm @-@ hmm .
okay , and @-@ and you should have seen grace .
i mean , she &apos;s giggling like a schoolgirl
every time this kid opens his mouth .
uh , grace is a schoolgirl .
and this guy &apos;s a stalker , okay ?
he &apos;s a stalker.he fits the profile .
profile ? called her five times in three days .
how do you know that ? -because i dumped her phone .
you dumped your kid &apos;s phone ?
yes.and the stalker is ... ten ? is he ?
what , ten years old ?
ted bundy was ten once .
yes , he was , danny .
yes , he was .
fong took apart the soundboard .
the wiring for the ieds
was connected to the sound effects button
marked &quot; boom , &quot;
and they were hidden here
and here in these two speaker boxes .
s.i.s. lifted
some prints off the soundboard .
most of them belonged to raines and his producer ,
but there were a couple of foreign ones
we ran through the system .
all right , good.we get any hits ?
yeah . they came back to tony archer , ex @-@ nypd
homicide.spent 30 years
as the lead investigator , 90 % conviction rate .
according to the press back in the day ,
he wrote the book on interrogation techniques .
what &apos;s he doing on our island ?
he retired to oahu four years ago .
six months after landing ,
he pulls a p.i. license .
check this out .
back when he was on the job ,
nypd got hit
by a corruption scandal .
wait a minute.i remember this .
raines used to talk about this .
he went hard
at the nypd on the radio every morning .
he was relentless .
were there ever charges filed against archer ?
no .
he was clean , but the guys that were dirty were friends of his .
well , maybe archer was harboring a grudge against raines .
he certainly had the know @-@ how . says here
he did a stint on the bomb squad .
we have an address on this guy ? -no , but he has a slip
registered in his name at the south shore sailing club .
hey .
don &apos;t move ! who are you ?
five @-@ o.-five what ?
put your weapon down right now .
you &apos;re trespassing.-put your weapon down !
maritime law says that i can shoot your ass off right now .
there is no such law . what are you talking about ?
what if i blow it off anyway ?
how about you put the gun down right now ?
last time i &apos;m gonna tell you .
listen , tough guy ,
i want a little i.d. first , all right ?
my name is commander steve mcgarrett .
the badge on my vest is the only i.d. you &apos;re gonna get .
i didn &apos;t bring my glasses ,
so you want to step a little closer to me ?
oh , yeah ? why don &apos;t you come over here ?
i just finished saying that , mcgruff , didn &apos;t i ?
mcgarrett . two &quot; rs , &quot; two &quot; ts . &quot;
mcgarrett . - whatever .
i hope you &apos;ll find it in your heart to forgive me .
listen . whoa . just listen .
i see no reason for one of us to get shot here .
we don &apos;t have to do this .
what we should do is maybe , uh ,
put our little peashooters down at the same time .
oh , yeah , how &apos;s that done ?
well , uh ,
you count-- one , two , three .
on the count of three , we put our guns down , huh ?
you got it .
you want me to start ?
that would be nice .
all right .
all right .
one .
you &apos;re doing good . keep going .
two .
three .
learned a big lesson , didn &apos;t you , pal ?
like you learned a big lesson , too , old man , huh ?
look , are these bracelets necessary ?
i know you guys ran me . you know i &apos;m a cop .
oh , you &apos;re an ex @-@ cop .
so do me a favor . zip it .
we found your prints all over raines &apos; boat .
well , of course you did .
you found plenty of &apos; em , too , didn &apos;t you , muscles ?
muscles ?
that &apos;s nice .
uh , it &apos;s detective danny williams .
the reason you found those prints on the boat , detective ,
is because bobby was my best pal .
i mean , i &apos;m his daughter &apos;s godfather .
i had a beer with him at least once a week ,
every week on that boat .
oh , and speaking of the , um , aforementioned ,
there &apos;s one sitting over there .
would you mind fetching that for me ?
you guys talk
telepathically ? because i don &apos;t hear an answer .
please .
what the hell &apos;s your name again ?
still detective danny williams .
well , danny , you &apos;re a big hump
okay
a hump .
all right , listen .
let &apos;s go back . how did you know raines ?
from back in new york ?
yeah . i did some work
for him in new york , and i did a little work for him here .
so , what kind of work ?
uh , work work .
like , uh ... you know , after you retire work .
a little of this , a little of that .
okay , pretend i &apos;m an idiot .
okay .
uh ,
security .
i did a little security work .
i mean , bobby was a ... a nut job magnet , right ?
so ... security .
okay , i @-@ i just ... i don &apos;t know if it &apos;s me .
i find it to be a very big coincidence
that you used to work bomb squad
and now this guy &apos;s dead , and he was killed by a bomb .
coincidence ?
mm @-@ hmm .
you got me there , hairdo .
you got me there .
so let me tell you the story .
here &apos;s how it goes .
i moved out here pretending i was going to retire ,
but because i was a good cop ,
i knew that this guy , too , would move out here someday .
so , one night , i paddle out to his yacht ,
and , because i know how , i plant
this very sophisticated bomb .
then i leave my prints all over the boat
just to confuse you guys .
i &apos;m telling you , this was a perfect crime .
my luck i had to run into you two sherlocks .
i mean , that is some amazing , amazing police work .
that was ... that was great .
that was very entertaining .
he &apos;s wasting our time .
lock him up .
okay .
what is that ?
what is what ?
there it is again .
what &apos;s the sound ?
well , i @-@ i don &apos;t ...
i don &apos;t hear nothing .
there &apos;s a sound !
well , i mean , it &apos;s a very old boat .
it &apos;s creaky , probably .
watch him .
yeah , yeah .
danny .
mmm .
nice .
danny , get him over here .
sit down .
you want to explain this ?
bait .
no , try again .
guy &apos;s my suspect .
suspect ? no , you don &apos;t get a suspect .
what do you mean ?
he &apos;s crazy ! keep him away from me !
hey , you &apos;ve been
in a chum box , pal . nobody &apos;s going
to go near you-- believe me .
stop talking .
who are you ?
len marks .
i ... did i just say stop talking ?
i asked him .
who are you ?
leonard marks .
i &apos;m a security guard at the yacht club .
yeah , now , tell my boys here
why you didn &apos;t show up for work last night ,
and why you left your post
and allowed someone to kill my best friend . tell them .
huh ?
i met a girl .
you were supposed to be on the job ,
you bum , you rent @-@ a @-@ cop piece of garbage , you .
okay , okay , okay , okay .
you took off work &apos; cause you met a girl .
i met her at the slippah &apos;s bar the night before .
okay , so what &apos;d you do ? you called in sick ?
no . he didn &apos;t even do that . the guy just didn &apos;t show up .
that &apos;s what he did.- all right .
all right , all right . when you did show up ,
did you notice anybody hanging around raines &apos;s yacht ?
anybody scouting it out , acting weird ?
anything ?
yeah .
his acolytes were always trying to get a piece of him--
photos , autographs , anything .
that &apos;s it . now we &apos;re talking , buddy .
whoa .
what ? what are you doing ?
what the hell are you doing , man ?
get out of here . the guy &apos;s a suspect .
he &apos;s supposed to be in jail . hey .
get ... get off ... would you stop ?
the guy belongs in jail , all right ? okay . all right .
so we &apos;ll save him a place right next to you--
the bunk right on top , okay ?
can i ask you a question ?
yeah , go ahead . you got shoes ?
i &apos;m in hawaii . what the hell do i need shoes for ?
you &apos;re going to jail . you got to have shoes to go to jail .
oh , so now you &apos;re concerned about my health and hygiene ?
that &apos;s very nice . that &apos;s very sweet .
you want to fetch them ?
they &apos;re right over there .
fetch .
you ready ? yeah .
let &apos;s go .
this is frigging stupid !
hey , max .
so you said you have something .
yes .
during my examination , i used a sticky disc
and an x @-@ ray fluorescence detector
to scan the body for trace .
i found potassium nitrate , carbon ,
sulfur , barium , and copper
both in the wounds and on the torso .
so is that good or bad ?
it &apos;s perplexing . how so ?
well , the first three components make gunpowder ,
common in bomb victims .
however , the latter two are utilized
to create the colors green and blue ,
respectively .
colors . okay .
you &apos;ve lost me , max .
i found thin paper inside raines &apos; wounds .
i sent it over to the lab for analysis ,
and they determined it was nosing paper .
oh , like the kind you use to make firecrackers ?
well , not exactly .
the bomb used to kill your victim was manufactured
using repurposed commercial @-@ grade fireworks ,
the kind you would typically find in a july fourth
or chinese new year &apos;s celebration .
i imagine it was a rather crude weapon .
but very effective .
chin and kono have got
a list of importers and permit holders
for professional @-@ grade fireworks .
okay , i got them chasing them down now .
okay . wait , wait , wait .
hold it . hold it . hold it . hold it .
j @-@ just let me get this straight here , magoo .
you now have your crack task force team
running around , asking guys if they illegally sold fireworks
to some wacko that wants to blow up raines ?
that &apos;s good
because i literally can see them
lining up to confess down there .
and i bow to your prowess as a detective .
please , shut up . all right ?
what we do after we drop your sorry ass off in jail
is our business , you understand ?
listen , just , please , dick tracy , stop .
because you and i both know
this is a complete waste of time .
you know it .
got a better idea ? yes .
yes , i have .
i always have a better idea .
give me the phone .
why ?
i want to schedule a pedicure .
i know a guy . give me the phone .
oh , well , he knows a guy . that &apos;s very promising .
give me the phone .
there you go .
hey , yo !
hold on a minute . this is your guy ?
that &apos;s my guy .
that &apos;s our guy .
easy , gentlemen .
plenty of me to go around .
hey . what &apos;s up , t ?
what &apos;s up with the jewelry ?
they run you down for the cash you owe me
on the card game last week ?
cash ? cards ?
what are you talking about , man ?
you know there &apos;s no gambling on this island .
it &apos;s illegal , right , officers ?
so how can i be of service
to my community ? well , i &apos;ll tell you .
okay , you remember that big mortar firework you got me
for new year &apos;s eve a couple years ago ?
of course i do .
hpd wasn &apos;t too happy when you launched it off of magic island .
oh , true that .
well , um , we need to know
where you bought it .
at the fireworks store , where else ?
it &apos;s the only place they sell that heavy @-@ duty stuff .
oh , good . you can take us there , right ?
can , can .
but i ain &apos;t walking in there .
that &apos;ll damage my future firework @-@ acquiring skills .
all right .
it &apos;s two blocks down . let &apos;s roll .
all right , come on . okay .
hold it .
listen , since we &apos;re trying to work together ,
maybe you could consider taking these things off .
maybe you can consider putting your shoes on .
don &apos;t need shoes .
stop . don &apos;t enable him .
i want to help you , gentlemen ,
but i &apos;m just the humble owner of a tiny
produce market .
just , uh , produce , huh ?
look at that . whoa !
okay , oh , what do we got ?
what do we got here ?
wow . yeah .
these kind of look like
fireworks to me .
let me tell you something about this , okay ?
i don &apos;t care about this .
i want the aerial mortars .
the large aerial mortars ,
you understand me ? sell any of those ?
look , i sell mortars for new year &apos;s .
this guy comes in , he wants big ones .
i had to call china for that .
okay , what &apos;s this guy &apos;s name ?
i didn &apos;t ask .
what &apos;d he look like ?
haole .
dark hair .
about your height .
that &apos;s all i remember .
okay , book him , muscles .
i like this guy .
come on . turn around .
no , no , wait , wait .
i remember a truck .
i brought the fireworks to a farm truck , and he drove away .
wait , farm truck ?
y @-@ you sure about the farm truck ?
yeah . i only remember
because it had a big picture of a lettuce on it .
what ?
um , we , uh , we got to go back to the boat .
come on . we got to go back.back to the boat ?
okay , so what are we doing here ?
bobby had this pet charity , uh ,
hale ku &apos;oko &apos;a--
house of freedom-- for runaway kids .
hold on a second .
i heard about the charity .
they put the kids up and give them legal help
to emancipate themselves , right ? that &apos;s right .
raines was involved in that ? oh , yeah , big @-@ time .
why ? what &apos;s so special about this charity ?
i guess when bobby was a kid , his dad was
a piece of work .
used to knock him around with
whatever the hell he had in his hand .
and , uh , well , anyway , it was bad .
so , one day , he ran away ,
never looked back.made something of himself .
and , uh , i guess he wants to get back to the kids .
it &apos;s here ... here you go .
here you go.here you go .
there &apos;s your head of lettuce right there .
let me see that .
why &apos;d you take this picture anyway ?
uh , i guess somebody &apos;s parents ,
they thought that raines was , you know ,
getting in the middle of some of their family business .
they didn &apos;t like it .
so they got together and they wanted to protest .
me , i wanted to take pictures ,
just in case , you know , they crossed that line again .
what are you talking about ?
well , some of these runaway charities--
they &apos;ve been vandalized .
just , you know , property damage
kind of crap.well , right ,
until now .
is that why raines bought the gun ?
no .
that would be me .
i told him he should be strapped ,
in case something happened .
guess it did him a lot of good , right ?
come on , you didn &apos;t know
that these whack jobs were gonna go out
and make bombs out of fireworks .
yeah , yeah . look , all right .
let &apos;s put a name to this face and find our killer .
doug leland
tax records show that he works at taka &apos;s farm
on the north shore , but when we reached out to them ,
they said he hadn &apos;t been there in days .
is something wrong ?
uh , this is a computer .
wow , that &apos;s pretty good , detective .
i &apos;m kono , by the way .
uh , anthony .
pleasure to meet you.pleasure.
i hope to enhance that feeling as time goes on .
all right ,
do we know where leland lives ?
uh , yeah .
we got a home address , but it &apos;s bogus .
it &apos;s not even a residential building .
see , uh ...
i don &apos;t know .
what don &apos;t you know ? what are you thinking ?
i &apos;m thinking that this guy didn &apos;t do it .
is that right ?
yeah , that &apos;s right .
care to elaborate ?
yeah , um ... leland &apos;s a coward .
see , when hpd rolled up ,
the protestors he was with ,
they all linked arms and sat down .
but not this guy ; he just ran .
yeah , he ran because he had something to hide . makes sense .
well , you see a suspect , i see a coward .
this afternoon , you couldn &apos;t see anything without your glasses .
hey , check this out .
according to this ,
leland worked demolitions
for five years
at a mine in colorado.that means he knew explosives .
do you still think that he didn &apos;t do it ?
i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m just saying ,
there &apos;s something about it don &apos;t feel right .
but he has motive ; he has means ,
which means he &apos;s a suspect , so we will check him out .
in the meantime , what do we got on his known associates ?
well , hpd has field interview cards
on the protestors associated with leland ,
and most of them live or work off @-@ island ;
couple of them are in jail , except one :
karen whitfield .
let &apos;s go talk to her , see what she knows .
what do i do with him ?
tony.hmm ?
it &apos;s been a pleasure , and you &apos;re free to go , all right ?
go ? go ? w @-@ where am i going ?
what , am i gonna go to the beach , have a mai tai ?
there &apos;s some guy running around there
that killed a friend of mine .
i don &apos;t think so , pal.i don &apos;t think so .
you got no choice.look , you don &apos;t know me .
i don &apos;t know you .
but i knew bobby .
and i owe him .
i owe more than one .
so i &apos;m asking you , please ,
please let me help you with this one .
doug told me he was losing his son due to
the emancipation program raines supported .
uh , the hale ku &apos;oko &apos;a house ?
that &apos;s right .
and i didn &apos;t think it was right .
some radio guy getting in the middle of family problems ?
doug was trying to work things out with his son .
want to sit ?
okay .
no , no , thanks .
i &apos;ll stand .
i got , uh , two new knees a couple years ago--
warranty expired .
so how do you know leland ?
i met him at one of the protests .
do you have children ?
when i was 12 years old , i broke my arm .
and that was right after i &apos;d just gotten stitches
after falling off my bike .
one of my teachers thought i was being abused by my father
and tried to put me in a home .
and when i tried to tell them the truth ,
they just thought i was scared and lying .
it took two years for everything to get back to normal .
but if i had been taken away ,
my life and my father &apos;s would have been ruined .
so , when i heard leland &apos;s story , i wanted to do something .
and because i &apos;m a paralegal , i was able to help
with some forms to fight the emancipation .
but ...
but , um ... that never happened , did it ?
no .
so you just stopped helping him .
just stopped . why ?
look , karen , um ...
i lost a very ...
very , very dear friend of mine ; he got murdered .
and , uh ,
i just think leland might know something .
i was with doug one day , and i saw ...
i don &apos;t know , these @-@ these devices
with wires coming out of them .
these diagrams
and these pictures of someone &apos;s house and boat .
it ...
i &apos;m so stupid .
i should have just ...
it &apos;s okay .
um , did you ask him about it ?
i got scared .
i just left .
we never talked after that .
and where did you see this ?
in his r.v.
where is that ?
he had it parked near manoa falls .
but that was a couple weeks ago .
um ...
karen
do you think that doug is capable of murder ?
doug blamed raines for breaking up his family .
he was angry and he talked about sending raines a message ,
so ...
yes .
i think he killed him .
move it !
on the couch !
clear .
let &apos;s go .
you &apos;re lying !
we found the exact same type of bomb materials
in your r.v. that was used to kill raines .
what can i say ? it &apos;s a coincidence .
bomb @-@ making a hobby of yours ?
yeah , i like to work with my hands .
you think this is a joke ?
raines financed your son &apos;s emancipation
and you wanted him dead for it .
i wanted him dead . that &apos;s right .
but i didn &apos;t kill him .
i don &apos;t believe you .
those bombs were just meant to scare him .
i wanted to blow that whole damn runaway home into the sky .
but ...
but what ?
i don &apos;t know ...
all right ? i just couldn &apos;t do it .
where were you two days ago ?
i drove my r.v.up to manoa .
anybody who can vouch for that ?
no .
i went up there alone .
wait . you drove your r.v.
up to manoa a couple days ago ?
that &apos;s right .
and before then ?
i &apos;d never been there before .
leland &apos;s friend karen told me
the r.v. was parked in manoa falls weeks ago .
now leland &apos;s saying he &apos;s never been there before two days ago .
one of them &apos;s lying .
yeah . or both . i &apos;ll go tell mcgarrett .
karen whitfield ?
five @-@ o !
karen ?
karen .
her body &apos;s still warm .
hey , hey , hey ! drop the gun !
don &apos;t be ridiculous.i told you :
when i got here she was dead already , and she was still warm .
so naturally , i searched the perimeter ,
looking for the killer .
what is he doing here ?
i am following the evidence .
what evidence ?
come here .
see this ?
slippah &apos;s bar .
okay . so what does that have to do with the murder ?
well , slippahs bar &apos;s this joint that my suspect--
that , uh , security guard--
he was there that night that the bomb was planted .
okay , i understand ,
but i &apos;m sure there were plenty of girls there .
that &apos;s very true .
but when i showed him her picture ,
he i.d. &apos; d her as the girl he went home with .
all right . so she picks him up ; she steals his keycard ;
she gets access to the yacht .
where she plants one of the bombs
she stole off of leland after she &quot; befriended &quot; him .
homegirl &apos;s quite the operator .
nice .
gold stars all around here .
okay . so @-@ so karen blew up raines .
uh , makes sense , but it still does not explain motive .
and it still does not explain
who killed her .
so , it turns out that karen whitfield &apos;s an alias .
her real name is susan dupree .
she has outstanding warrants in arizona and california
for sweetheart scams ...
targeted the wealthy &quot; lonely seeking love &quot; set .
and she also had a male partner .
that &apos;s an old school scam right there .
okay , well , raines was single .
maybe he was one of their marks and things did not go so good .
no , no , no , no . if @-@ if he had a girl ,
i think i &apos;d have known about it .
there &apos;s no way .
we need answers . we need the partner .
okay , what do we got on the partner ? what do we know ?
not much . white male , early 20s .
no real i.d. or composites ,
but according to the crime report
they made off with close to a million dollars
before they disappeared .
yeah , well , close to a million dollars
wasn &apos;t enough for these two .
they came here to pull another scam .
tell me , when did she get to oahu ?
i got the credit card statements .
she bought a ticket from phoenix to oahu last summer , june 12 .
okay , give me phone records from the day she landed , kono .
all right , got some outgoing 808s ...
give me names .
whoa , what is it ?
it &apos;s todd dutton .
that &apos;s brandi &apos;s husband .
yeah . and karen &apos;s partner .
why ?
now tell me why .
you talk to me , you son of a bitch ,
or i will kill you right here .
i don &apos;t care who &apos;s watching .
look , it &apos;s not what you think , okay ?
i @-@ i would never hurt brandi .
what ?
what &apos;d you say ?
you wanted her money .
so you and karen-- you had bobby raines killed
because you knew that your wife stood to inherit bobby &apos;s millions .
no , no ... i didn &apos;t have anything to do with that .
that was all karen &apos;s idea .
why ?
she was tired of waiting .
waiting ?
waiting , but that &apos;s @-@ that &apos;s the grift , right ?
isn &apos;t that the plan ?
you wait ?
the plan was for me to marry brandi
and to @-@ to skim off of her trust .
but this time it was ... it was different .
different how ? how different ?
i fell in love with brandi .
and karen knew she wasn &apos;t getting a payday , huh ?
she killed mr. raines
because she thought that if ...
if my wife inherited his money , i &apos;d pay her off .
you just killed her instead ?
i went over there to reason with her .
okay ? things ...
i mean , they got out of control .
i just ... i wanted her out of my life .
bobby trusted you .
he gave you his daughter , but now ...
he gave you his daughter .
i &apos;m sorry .
not good enough .
hey .
i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s nice .
i think tony had it right :
the whole shoe thing &apos;s overrated .
nice .
look , on that ... i mean , if this is something you &apos;re gonna do ...
regularly ...
you should invest in some nail clippers , danny .
no , no . i @-@ i didn &apos;t ...
i didn &apos;t say that it &apos;s gonna be a lifestyle choice .
you know , i just ... i &apos;m enjoying it ; it feels good .
it does feel good . that it does , my friend .
that it does .
and you know what else ?
we got everything we need right here .
no . no . we don &apos;t have everything we need
because this guy-- he promised me
an authentic slice of new york pizza--
a real , authentic new york slice .
and all he did was bring us to the ss minnow here .
yeah , what &apos;s with that ?
depressing , and it &apos;s ... it &apos;s not honest .
tony ! i am starving . what &apos;s going on ?
put a sock in it , will you ?
here she comes .
the one , the only , original ray &apos;s ,
flown in direct .
now . when tony archer promises you something ,
you can bet you get it ... 50 % of the time anyway .
here . try it .
you &apos;re a good man .
you &apos;re a good man , tony .
this is beautiful .
all right . this is sweet .
what are you doing ? you fold ... you fold it up ?
this is good .
fold it up . bend it over .
oh , this is good .
that &apos;s a ... that &apos;s a good piece of pizza right there .
no , no , no , no .
see , where we come from , you don &apos;t say &quot; piece . &quot;
it &apos;s a &quot; slice . &quot; we call it a slice .
slice . no , hold on . don &apos;t try to , um ,
domesticate him . he &apos;s an animal .
trust me . i &apos;m not an animal .
you were born an animal .
you &apos;re gonna be an animal for the rest of your life .
it &apos;s pizza . what makes me an animal ? hold @-@ hold it .
hold it . hold it . huh ?
let me ask you something .
you two hens peck at each other like this all the time ?
all the time ?
no .
yeah .
absolutely . no , no .
well ... come on .
i &apos;ll tell you what i &apos;m going to do .
&apos;cause i &apos;m a good guy .
and more importantly , i need some laughs in my life .
i &apos;m gonna be your marriage counselor .
you got a problem with a case ,
or any time you need help , basically ,
i &apos;ll be here for you .
