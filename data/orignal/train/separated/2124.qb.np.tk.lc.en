hey , ma .
where you sneaking off to ?
i &apos;m not sneaking off anywhere .
i was just trying to be considerate and not wake you up .
oh , that &apos;s nice .
thank you for being considerate
while sneaking off .
where you going ?
i &apos;m just ...
um , i &apos;ll get that .
oh , good morning .
morning , ma &apos;am .
i got it , mom .
hey , buddy . hey .
what is all this ?
don &apos;t worry about it .
what &apos;d i just say ? don &apos;t worry about it .
sign the thing for the guy .
no , not until you tell me what &apos;s in the boxes .
okay , i &apos;ll sign it .
all right ?
thanks , buddy .
good luck .
all right .
so , you &apos;re really not gonna tell me what &apos;s in the boxes ?
you &apos;re not gonna tell me where you &apos;re going ?
i have an appointment .
it &apos;s really none of your business .
okay . well , have fun at your , uh ,
none @-@ of @-@ my @-@ business appointment .
okay . have fun with your mystery boxes .
what &apos;s all this ?
a farewell breakfast .
oj or papaya this morning ?
jerry , i appreciate this farewell breakfast
and the farewell dinner last night ,
and i think we both agreed
it &apos;s time for you to move on , right ?
was it the snoring ?
no .
because , you know , i can get one of those breathing mask things .
listen to me . it wasn &apos;t the snoring , okay ?
it wasn &apos;t ... it &apos;s not you at all .
you didn &apos;t ... it &apos;s me .
you &apos;re a great roomie . i &apos;m just ...
i like to live alone , okay ?
you can understand that , right ?
you sure it &apos;s safe for me to go home ?
yeah ! yes !
the @-@ the chinese government are ...
they got ... they got bigger fish to fry right now .
we can still be friends ?
what are you talking about ?
we are friends . that &apos;s not gonna change .
good @-@ bye hug ?
come on .
that &apos;s it , buddy .
jerry .
you want me to get that ?
might be better if i get it , jerry .
mcgarrett .
okay , i &apos;m on my way .
i gotta go , all right ?
you okay with this ?
okay .
divorce attorney ?
you sure ?
i &apos;m positive .
she told you that ?
no , it &apos;s not what she told me .
you followed her ?
i might have followed her .
you followed her .
i did .
but she was being very suspicious this morning , okay ?
she &apos;s sneaking all around the house .
and you &apos;re not allowed to judge me , okay ,
because i know for a fact that you surveilled your own mother ,
and that makes us even , so ...
you know what ?
maybe seeing a divorce attorney isn &apos;t the worst thing .
i mean , then your mother can weigh her options , right ?
no @-@ no @-@ no . attorneys are never a good thing , okay ?
they get a hold of you , and forget about it . it &apos;s no good .
all right , well , you &apos;ll want to hope that this
top secret op you got planned for tonight works .
it will . i hope .
uh @-@ huh .
how are you gonna get her out of the house ?
day of beauty at the spamakani .
shiatsu massage , mani @-@ pedi by the pool .
the whole thing , it was not cheap .
but if it works , it &apos;ll be worth it , you know ?
hey , chin , what do you got ?
mailman noticed that the door was forced .
thought it looked suspicious and dialed 911 .
operating theory is that we &apos;re looking at a burglary gone bad .
how bad ?
take a look .
the victim is the homeowner ,
russell donovan .
and based on preliminary examination ,
mr. donovan &apos;s c.o.d.
is a close @-@ contact gunshot wound to the ventral thorax .
that , along with the rather notable hematomas
and ecchymoses along the victim &apos;s arms ,
suggest that the victim made
quite a struggle prior to being shot .
liver temperature puts the time of death
at approximately 3 : 00 a.m.
looks like whoever busted in here brought their own key .
very subtle .
so , this guy gets woken up to the sounds of a burglary ,
come outs , this guy surprises him with a gun ,
and here we go .
what else do we know about mr. donovan ?
he s a 45 @-@ year @-@ old school teacher . single father .
lives here with his 16 year @-@ old daughter , kelly .
where is she ?
at this point , we &apos;re not sure . bed &apos;s still made .
we &apos;re still trying to determine whether
she &apos;s staying with some other family or maybe a friend .
hey , i don &apos;t think she is .
a neighbor a few houses down saw a car
racing down the block around 3 : 00 a.m.
with kelly in the passenger seat .
they brought it up to an officer during the canvass .
we get a description of the car or the driver ?
nothing solid on the driver-- male , 20s--
but we have a plate .
vanity tags , h2osprt .
commander .
you may want to look at that .
it &apos;s the daughter &apos;s cell phone .
csu found it on the floor of one of the bedrooms .
looks like she was trying to call for help .
killer took her .
duke , get a maile amber alert out right now .
i want that girl found before this turns into a double homicide .
how &apos;s it going ?
aloha .
we &apos;re looking for jay cooper .
that &apos;s jay over there .
how do we get him down ?
let me call him in for you .
jay , bring it in .
five @-@ o wants to talk to you .
can i help you gentlemen ?
ditch the hardware . we &apos;re gonna be here a while .
i want you to take another look .
i think you might be mistaken .
i don &apos;t need to take another look .
i don &apos;t know them .
i &apos;ve never seen this girl before in my life .
okay , fine . then why don &apos;t you explain to me
how she was in your car this morning
leaving the scene of a murder / kidnapping ?
what ?
wait . hold on . what car ?
2008 blue chevy impala .
&quot; h2o sports &quot; vanity plate registered to you .
i wasn &apos;t driving that car last night .
oh , somebody drove that car .
well , it wasn &apos;t me .
it died on me about a week ago .
it was towed to &apos; aikapu &apos;s auto repair over on 17th .
as far as i know , it &apos;s still there .
i don &apos;t understand .
that car was for sure here
when i closed up and was pau hana last night .
anything else missing ?
uh , just one of my mechanics .
kid named tommy fa &apos;aloa .
he never show up for work .
i been calling his ass all morning trying to get a hold of him .
is he the type that might borrow a car ?
tommy ? nah .
he had pilikia with the law a while back ,
but he &apos;s a good kid .
been nothing but honest and reliable since the day i hired him .
do you recognize these people ?
yeah , that &apos;s russ donovan and his daughter kelly .
been a customer of mine for a couple years .
schoolteacher , i think .
i never even know he had a daughter until she brought
her car in here a few months ago with a transmission problem .
did something happen to them ?
they okay or what ?
no , they &apos;re not okay .
mr. donovan was murdered early this morning ,
and we suspect his daughter kelly was kidnapped by the person
who was driving that blue impala .
what , you think tommy had something to do with it ?
well , we don &apos;t know . i mean , it &apos;s looking like maybe , yeah .
you got a recent address for him ?
right upstairs . i rent him one room .
any family you know about ?
none that i know of .
this no make sense .
i know tommy &apos;s done some stupid things in the past ,
but ... the boy &apos;s not a killer .
well , nobody &apos;s a killer until they kill somebody , right ?
tommy fa &apos;aloa was first arrested when he was 12 years old .
since then , he &apos;s been locked up for assault , burglary
and a couple of strong @-@ armed robberies .
right , but never anything approaching
the level of murder or kidnapping .
well , something set this kid off .
just got off the phone with csu .
search of tommy &apos;s room came up empty .
so i searched into his juvie record
to see if i could get some info on his family .
check this out .
it &apos;s not a pretty picture .
parents were charged with meth trafficking in 2000
when tommy was just seven years old .
they were also charged with child abuse
when cps found evidence that tommy
was severely malnourished and physically abused .
he was put into foster care .
and when he wasn &apos;t in jail ,
he bounced around from family to family until he was 18 .
okay . all right , catherine , listen , call crime stoppers .
have them get tommy &apos;s photo to all the local tv stations ,
and let &apos;s get a dedicated tips line set up , too .
got it . kono &apos;s also running down past arrest associates
and digging into some phone records .
uh , we also flagged his credit cards and bank accounts .
so , if they &apos;re on this island , we &apos;ll find them .
jerry , what are you doing here ,
and why do you have my father &apos;s toolbox ?
i found it in your garage .
you found it . okay , yes . you found it .
because it @-@ it wasn &apos;t lost . that &apos;s where i keep it . in the garage .
what were you doing in my garage ?
laundry .
i thought i &apos;d get a load in before moving out .
we should go .
all right , jerry ,
i thought ... i thought this morning
we ... we both agreed that you were leaving .
you were leaving this morning , right ?
well , i was .
but then i found this little anomaly .
it &apos;s a giant mystery that &apos;s been sitting under your nose the whole time .
okay , jerry , what &apos;s the mystery ?
what color is this ?
well , it &apos;s red , jerry .
that &apos;s a good guess , but it &apos;s actually american rose .
okay . you don &apos;t get it , do you ?
no .
these toolboxes only came in one color ,
alizarin crimson , not american rose .
so the question is , who would repaint a toolbox ?
i don &apos;t know . who would repaint a toolbox , jerry ?
no one .
not unless they were trying to hide something .
take a look at this .
you &apos;d be surprised what you &apos;d find
with an active imagination and a little scraping .
this means something to you .
shelburne was a code name my mother used as a cia operative .
the other two lines , they don &apos;t mean anything to me .
hold on . back up .
did you just say your mom worked for the company ?
still does .
whoa . info bomb .
i need a sec to process this .
shelburne is misspelled .
there should be an &quot; e &quot; on the end of it .
it &apos;s probably a mistake .
probably not .
look , i know you got a lot on your plate ,
but this is clearly some kind of code or cipher .
so if it &apos;s all right with you , i &apos;d like to dig a little deeper .
i promise i &apos;ll stay out of your hair .
okay . all right .
see what you can do .
do me a favor : keep it on the dl
and , uh , keep me in the loop .
of course .
we &apos;re a team .
steve ?
yeah .
thanks .
okay , so tommy &apos;s cell phone is turned off ,
making it untraceable . no shock there .
but we also ran kelly &apos;s phone and found this .
multiple calls between tommy and kelly dating back three months .
and they start the day after she took her car into the shop .
and they &apos;re not these two @-@ minute
&quot; when will my car be ready ? &quot; type of phone calls .
yeah , some of them lasted over an hour .
these two were in a relationship .
yeah .
that could explain a lot .
young , innocent girl falls for ...
older bad @-@ boy type ; father disapproves ,
tries to break it up .
yeah .
and he pays for it with his life .
tommy , look out !
hey , hey ! what the hell are you doing to my car ?
stop it !
stop it ! you &apos;re gonna kill him !
tommy !
get in the car !
all units be advised , subject vehicle , black sedan ,
license plate mike @-@ quebec @-@ sierra @-@ 117,
last seen in the 3600 block of north salt lake boulevard .
there . center lane . black sedan .
plates match .
call duke .
sergeant lukela .
hey , duke ,
mcgarrett . listen to me , we got eyes
on the subject vehicle , okay ? he &apos;s headed northbound
on salt lake approaching aloha stadium .
i &apos;m gonna need roadblocks .
copy that .
all right , we got cops .
what ?
don &apos;t @-@ don &apos;t look .
don &apos;t turn around .
tommy , what are you doing ?
what are you doing ?
disconnecting the air bags .
son of a bitch . he &apos;s made us . all right , put the pursuit out .
this is lieutenant kelly . all units ,
please be advised we are in pursuit of the vehicle .
hang on .
what ?
look out !
you all right ?
yeah .
that &apos;s a pretty good trick .
son of a bitch .
ma ?
ma ?
ma , you home ?
daniel ?
i thought you were at work .
i was at work . i called you 30 times .
i was worried about you .
i told you we &apos;re doing something at 3 : 00 .
what &apos;s going on ?
sorry .
what are you doing ? what , are you crying ?
no . i was cutting onions before .
did you bring the onion in the bathroom ?
no . do you always have to be a detective ?
yeah . pretty much . it &apos;s what i do .
you want to have a seat , mom ?
sure .
look , ma , i know , uh ...
i know you went and saw a ... an attorney today .
oh , yeah ? how do you know that ?
because i &apos;m a detective .
what happened ?
what did he say ?
he said that it would be rough ,
that we don &apos;t have a lot of savings
and that we would have to sell the house .
well , that &apos;s ... that can &apos;t happen .
i know that . all those memories and everything .
but ...
daniel , i deserve someone who appreciates me .
i deserve to be happy , too .
and if it takes ...
getting a divorce and selling the house ,
then so be it .
that is on your father , not me .
okay . so ... so what happened ? what @-@ what ...
what &apos;d you do ?
i mean , i have been here for a month ,
and he hasn &apos;t tried to call once .
the silence , it speaks volumes , doesn &apos;t it ?
yes . uh , but , mom ...
so i went to the lawyer and i filed for divorce today .
i &apos;m sorry .
i know that hurts , and i &apos;m really sorry .
it is not about me . it is about you ,
and it &apos;s about you being happy .
all right ? so if you make a decision that makes you happy ,
then i will support you no matter what , okay ?
i promise .
i love you .
i love you , too .
now , come on . i told you , i got something nice planned today .
yeah , i don &apos;t really feel like going anywhere .
which is exactly why you should do this . trust me , okay ?
it &apos;s gonna be very nice . i got you a @-@ a beauty day ,
a day of beauty at the spamakani .
okay ? they &apos;re gonna do all kinds of nice things ,
uh , set you up really good
and put a pretty smile on that beautiful face , okay ?
you did that ?
i did that , yes .
uh , all paid for by me , your loving son ,
who you cannot say no to .
uh , also it is gonna be too late to get a refund ,
so if you could . come on . it &apos;ll be really nice .
okay , i &apos;ll do that for you .
you know , your father could learn a few things from you .
uh , we got about ten minutes , though .
let &apos;s go , okay ?
you guys okay ?
oh , a little banged up .
egos a little bruised , but we &apos;ll live .
they found the car ditched a couple of miles away .
probably jacked another set of wheels by now , huh ?
i &apos;d say so .
how &apos;s tommy &apos;s latest victim ?
gsw to the thigh , just missed the femoral artery ,
but he &apos;s in stable condition .
you said on the phone you had some other news ?
yeah .
the phone company got back to me with the incoming
and outgoing call records on donovan &apos;s home phone .
there was a phone call placed to tommy &apos;s cell phone
30 minutes before donovan was killed .
wait a minute . so , this whole thing could have been planned ?
maybe , but then why would tommy need
to force his way in with a crowbar
if kelly was there to let him in ?
oh . uh , i @-@ i know what you &apos;re thinking .
a beautiful mind .
i get it , but don &apos;t worry .
the marker &apos;s erasable ,
and i can have all this cleaned up in five minutes .
you won &apos;t even know i was here .
what is all this stuff ?
well , i was thinking about what you said
about &quot; shelburn &quot; being misspelled .
you see , a lot of codes use ciphers
that don &apos;t repeat letters .
&quot; shelburne &quot; has two &quot; e &quot; s ,
but on the toolbox ,
there &apos;s only one . and one of the ciphers
that eliminates repeat letters
is called &quot; polybius square . &quot;
i think that &apos;s what the &quot; ps &quot; stands for .
polybius square .
boom . you see that ?
you and me finishing each other &apos;s sentences .
well , you just ... you just told me what ...
oh . all right , i got it .
can we ... ? i don &apos;t have all day , jerry , is all .
copy that , partner .
i constructed this
polybius square , and i used the code name shelburn
to decipher the two other letter sequences
on the toolbox , and it gave me these numbers .
it &apos;s pretty cool , right ?
sure .
yeah , yeah , i mean , it &apos;d be cooler
if i knew what the numbers meant , though ?
the &quot; q &quot; in the first sequence is
actually the greek symbol phi .
phi .
which ...
phi , which is sometimes used to denote latitude .
bingo .
these are geographic coordinates ?
exactly .
and the mystery location is ...
cambodia .
your dad have any connection to that part of the world ?
i mean , he served in vietnam in &apos; 68,
but my mom is shelburne .
she hadn &apos;t even met my dad in &apos; 68 .
so what does any of this have to do with her ?
i just can &apos;t believe this is happening .
i mean , i didn &apos;t like tommy .
i told kelly that .
but i didn &apos;t think he &apos;d ever kill her father .
why didn &apos;t you like tommy ?
he was older than her , and just seemed sketchy .
kelly said he was even in prison .
i told her to dump him .
i mean , she could have any guy she wanted at school .
but tommy had her convinced
he was trying to turn his life around .
i didn &apos;t buy it .
amy , did kelly ever mention
the two of them running away together ?
like , where they might go ?
no , never .
i just don &apos;t get why she liked him .
all tommy ever did was make her life more difficult at home .
what do you mean ?
nothing .
i just ...
you know .
it caused a lot of problems .
amy , i &apos;m just trying to get kelly home safe ,
so if you know anything that can help me do that ,
you need to tell me .
he was hitting her .
tommy ?
no . her dad .
so , i was able to pull these images from kelly &apos;s computer .
according to her best friend , amy ,
russell donovan was an overprotective ,
controlling father who had a bad temper .
right , and , apparently , he liked to use his fists .
yeah , and kelly wasn &apos;t just documenting it with pictures .
csu was able to recover this journal during a search of her room .
she writes about incidents of abuse
dating all the way back to when she was 11 .
it &apos;s , uh , some pretty chilling stuff .
that &apos;s what her and tommy had in common .
they were both victims of abuse .
these photos look like they were taken recently .
well , maybe kelly finally got the courage
to take a stand against her father
and she was gathering evidence to make a case against him .
so , kelly gets into a beef with her father ,
she threatens to turn him in , he gets rough with her ,
she goes , and she calls tommy .
tommy shows up ,
forces his way in and puts a bullet into donovan &apos;s chest .
maybe not .
ballistics report just came back ,
and the slug that max took out of russell donovan &apos;s body
was an exact match to a nine @-@ millimeter glock
that was registered to him .
donovan was murdered with his own gun .
so , tommy didn &apos;t go there intending to murder kelly &apos;s father .
no . he went there intending to save her .
all right , that &apos;s it .
there &apos;s nobody left inside but the clerk .
remember , honk twice if there &apos;s trouble .
look , are you sure you want to do this ?
we &apos;re gonna need the cash if we want to get off this rock .
right .
tommy , wait .
i love you .
i &apos;ll be right back .
okay .
liquor store ? how long ago ?
couple of minutes . clerk i.d. &apos; d the stickup man as tommy .
anybody hurt ?
no , not this time .
they fled south on kaukonahua road in a cadillac
that was reported stolen in the area a little while ago .
call hpd , have them get a helo in the air .
i want roadblocks in a 15 @-@ mile radius , 360 @-@ degree perimeter .
the whole place needs to be locked down .
no one gets away this time .
copy .
there &apos;s over 900 bucks here .
yeah . should be enough to lay low
till we can make the move to the mainland .
we got to ditch this car , get off the road .
gonna be lots of cops out there looking for us , you know ?
were you scared ?
yeah . yeah , i was .
i &apos;m just glad the clerk didn &apos;t get stupid .
and what if he did ?
would you have shot him , too ?
only if i had to .
3 bravo 233 to central . be advised ,
we are in pursuit of a code @-@ 10 vehicle with two occupants .
the subject vehicle now headed southbound
on the 1500 block of kapiolani boulevard ...
slow down ! just slow ...
what &apos;s wrong with you ? what &apos;s the matter ?
what &apos;s the matter with you ?
slow down !
what are you talking about ?
it &apos;s like your first time on a roller coaster .
n @-@ no .
roller coasters aren &apos;t this scary , okay ?
this is petrifying .
danny , danny , danny , danny !
what ?
we &apos;ve done this 118 times .
and i have been petrified 118 times .
okay ? i &apos;m just verbalizing .
verbalizing ?
look , yes , it means to @-@ to be verbal .
i know what it means .
3 bravo 233 to all units ,
be advised suspect vehicle is now on ilalo street
approaching kakaako .
okay , we &apos;re about five minutes out ,
assuming we make it there at all .
kono , what do you got ?
a pretty good theory , i think .
you know those photos on kelly &apos;s computer of abuse ?
they &apos;re not real .
the digital time stamp data
on the photos didn &apos;t match with the details in the journal ,
so we took a closer look at everything .
max examined the photos of kelly &apos;s injuries ,
and he &apos;s convinced they were self @-@ inflicted .
wait a minute.she faked the abuse .
why would she do that ?
to convince tommy she was being abused ,
and then manipulate him into killing her father .
we got any evidence to back this up ?
four months ago ,
kelly paid for access to a commercial database ,
and she used it to run a criminal history check on tommy fa &apos;aloa .
hold on . that &apos;s @-@ that &apos;s a month before she met him at the shop .
that &apos;s right .
she used him , steve .
she needed someone to get rid of her father ,
and tommy fit the bill perfectly .
parolee with a temper and a violent criminal past ,
no girlfriend on the island , no family .
he was the perfect candidate .
if she wasn &apos;t being abused ,
why would she want to murder her own father ?
money . life insurance .
her father had a platinum policy ,
and kelly was the sole beneficiary .
hold on .
tommy !
throw out your weapon
and place your hands on the dashboard in front of you .
this is your last warning .
throw your weapon from the car
and place your hands on the dashboard .
duke ? duke ?
hold your fire . hold your fire .
nobody fires until i give the order .
damn !
i &apos;m so sorry .
i just wanted to stop him from hurting you .
it wasn &apos;t supposed to be like this .
no .
actually , it was .
help !
help ! he has a gun !
no ! kelly , wait !
gun ! gun !
hold your fire !
put the gun down !
get away from me !
put the gun down !
hold your fire !
cease fire !
cease fire !
cease fire .
hold your fire !
cease fire !
tommy . hang in there , kid .
all right ? you hang in there .
get me a paramedic here right now ! i need a paramedic !
hello ?
hey ... if you can hear me , i need to talk to somebody .
look , i &apos;m not supposed to be here .
there &apos;s been some kind of mistake .
oh , thank god .
look , there &apos;s been some kind of mix @-@ up .
i shouldn &apos;t be here .
no . you &apos;re right where you belong , kelly .
you better get used to it ,
&apos;cause you &apos;re gonna be in a place like this for a very long time .
who are you ? what @-@ what are you talking about ?
i &apos;m a victim .
you know , a lot of people have sat in that chair--
murderers , thieves , terrorists .
you know what makes most of them ... so dangerous ?
it &apos;s the same thing that makes you so dangerous .
the complete lack of a conscience .
the inability to feel remorse .
i was kidnapped .
my father was murdered .
you &apos;re not a victim .
and tommy fa &apos;aloa ... he wasn &apos;t your boyfriend .
he was your mark .
and now he &apos;s dead .
you knew everything about him , didn &apos;t you ?
you knew where he was from .
you knew what he did .
you handpicked that kid .
i have no idea what you &apos;re talking about .
you found someone who was capable of killing ,
someone who had nothing to lose and no one to love ,
and then you convinced him
that your father was abusing you .
you see , tommy ...
tommy thought he was protecting you from a monster .
but as it turns out ...
the monster &apos;s you .
kelly , you know what a sociopath is ?
you think i &apos;m stupid ?
no .
on the contrary , i think you &apos;re brilliantly evil .
i &apos;m just glad we were able to stop you when we did ,
&apos;cause left alone , who knows how many bodies
would &apos;ve been left in your wake ?
i want a lawyer .
right now . and i want my phone call .
i get a phone call !
kelly !
you get nothing .
that &apos;s your father &apos;s million @-@ dollar life insurance policy .
he was a real planner , your dad .
he wanted to make sure you were taken care of
in case anything were to ever happen to him .
but you knew that , didn &apos;t you ? what you didn &apos;t know
is that he recently let the policy lapse .
he stopped paying the premium .
you &apos;re lying .
no , she &apos;s not .
you see , your dad had to make a choice--
start saving for your college education
or keep paying this premium .
he couldn &apos;t afford both .
chose your education .
so you see , kelly , it &apos;s like i said .
you get nothing .
happy reading .
here you go .
thank you .
wow , ma .
check you out . you look amazing .
thank you .
you look very nice yourself . why are you all dressed up ?
that &apos;s a fantastic question . come on , i &apos;ll show you .
all right .
you really look good .
what are you up to , daniel ?
just wait for it , ma . i &apos;ll show you .
this way , lady .
whoa , what is all of this ?
uh , the table is right this way .
silvio &apos;s ?
yeah .
that &apos;s where your father and i ...
had your first date , yeah .
this is all authentic.this is the original table
that you guys sat at . um , had it all shipped in .
so that &apos;s what the boxes were ?
yeah . this is ... this is the last of it .
it &apos;s amazing , but how did you do this ?
you were at work all day , weren &apos;t you ?
i did a little , uh , preplanning .
uh , i took care of all the finances ,
and , uh , my beautiful sisters back in jersey , they took care
of the purchasing and the shipping .
and i even , uh , imported a thickheaded consultant
from the mainland
to make sure i got all the details just right .
you did .
hi , eddie .
hello , clara .
okay , you guys got some stuff to discuss .
i &apos;m gonna go check on the kitchen .
okay .
thank you .
you really hurt me , you know .
i &apos;m sorry .
i love you and ...
i miss you and i want you to come home .
well , that &apos;s not gonna do it .
you can &apos;t just come here and say you &apos;re sorry
and expect me to go running back home .
why didn &apos;t you call me ?
i must have had
the phone in my hand at least a dozen times , i swear i did ,
but ...
but what ?
i was ...
embarrassed ...
and ashamed .
i was confused .
confused about what ?
about everything .
you see , for more than half of my life ,
that firehouse has been ...
my world .
i had someplace to go every day .
i had a purpose .
then ...
one day , i just ...
age out .
and ... they throw me a nice dinner
and they send me on my way with a shiny plaque .
you have no idea
what it &apos;s like to have something like that taken away ...
to @-@ to feel like ...
to feel like you just don &apos;t matter anymore .
oh , you think so ?
i know exactly what it feels like to not matter anymore .
but i missed you , i missed you all the time ,
and i really thought
that when you retired , that it would be our time again .
we wouldn &apos;t have the kids ,
and we can fall in love all over again
and be romantic and be a couple and have a good time .
but you made me feel like i didn &apos;t matter ... at all .
oh , clara , that &apos;s not true .
i realize that ...
you &apos;re all that matters .
if i could , i &apos;d go back and i would treat you
like the princess that you are .
i , uh ...
i came here to get you back .
and i &apos;m not leaving without you .
&apos;cause the truth is ,
i &apos;m nothing without you .
i love you .
may i take your order ?
what do you recommend , young lady ?
um ... well , we &apos;re out of everything but pizza .
okay .
well , then , i guess it &apos;s pizza .
one pizza .
would you like wine with dinner ?
oh , sure .
definitely .
daddy won &apos;t let me open it by myself .
enjoy .
thank you , baby .
how we looking out there ?
i think it &apos;s working .
yeah ?
have a look .
what are we doing here ?
joe white told me you were the man to see ,
uh , regarding doris .
and i &apos;ll tell you the same thing i told him .
the location of agency assets is classified .
i can &apos;t change the rules just because it &apos;s your mother .
i &apos;m not asking you to tell me where she is .
look , i &apos;m compromising my position with the agency
even acknowledging she &apos;s an active asset .
so why don &apos;t you tell me exactly what it is that you want ?
looks like an empty field .
yeah , we both know it &apos;s more than that .
walk away , commander .
well , you know i &apos;m not going to do that ,
so why don &apos;t you , uh , save me the trouble
and tell me what &apos;s in this field ?
and you know that &apos;s classified .
if i told you , i &apos;d be violating operational security .
what &apos;s one more violation ?
you gotta be kidding me . you wore a wire ?
the recording gets destroyed
right after you tell me what &apos;s in this field .
it &apos;s a grave .
it &apos;s a grave . okay . whose grave ? who &apos;s buried here ?
i &apos;m done talking .
i &apos;ve already said enough .
listen to me .
what you say here stays here .
it stays between us .
i &apos;m not going to do anything to jeopardize your career .
