mike ross is a fraud , and i &apos;m gonna make sure
he never sees the inside of a courtroom again
unless he &apos;s wearing an orange jumpsuit .
that woman doesn &apos;t get anything
by prosecuting a fraud like you ,
but she would love to get harvey specter .
i &apos;m not turning on harvey .
you gotta listen to me !
i &apos;m throwing you a goddamn lifeline !
i want to tell jeff the truth about mike ross .
he told you he loved you , didn &apos;t he ?
i just don &apos;t want to lie to him anymore .
your whole story about how louis got his name on the door
is bullshit !
and i came here to tell you the truth .
it &apos;s over . we &apos;re done .
never even thought for a second
that you would even consider
an idea so disgusting as turning on harvey .
the only reason i thought about it
is because i am scared to death of you going to prison .
i explicitly told you to stay away from mike &apos;s case .
i don &apos;t care .
donna , i don &apos;t think you get it .
there is going to come a time where you &apos;re gonna
have to choose between yourself and them .
if they &apos;re gonna come for me , they &apos;re gonna come for me .
are you saying you &apos;re coming back to me ?
yes , i am .
then i &apos;ll see you back in the office tomorrow .
dad , you know i have to practice .
i know you do , sweetheart ,
but there &apos;s something i have to tell you .
what is it ?
we &apos;re moving to connecticut .
what ? why ?
your mom and i think it &apos;s best for you .
and what if it &apos;s not best for me ?
honey , it is .
and i found us a great apartment just outside hartford .
lot more kids . you &apos;re gonna love it .
an apartment .
that &apos;s right .
it &apos;s gonna be so much better than this big , creaky--
there &apos;s something you &apos;re not telling me .
no , there isn &apos;t .
yes , there is .
how do you know that ?
i don &apos;t know ,
but i do .
oh , okay , donna .
my ... business hasn &apos;t worked out ,
and your uncle offered me a job .
i &apos;m so sorry , honey .
it &apos;s okay , daddy .
i &apos;ll let you practice .
dad ?
will there be a room for my piano ?
honey , i &apos;m afraid there won &apos;t be .
but your aunt teaches musical theater
just a few towns away .
i &apos;ve already signed you up .
thanks , daddy .
ms. paulsen .
could i get you a drink ?
i &apos;m not gonna be here long enough to finish it .
oh , you &apos;re gonna be here till i tell you you can go .
which you &apos;re gonna tell me sooner than you think ,
because i &apos;ve don &apos;t have anything to say .
i get it .
harvey specter was your boss for a long time--
maybe even more than your boss--
in which case , there &apos;s no chance in hell
you didn &apos;t know that he was conspiring with mike ross
to break the law .
the only thing i know is ...
that unless you &apos;re gonna arrest me ,
i &apos;m walking out that door right now .
good .
you &apos;re as tough as i expected you to be ,
so for now , you are free to go .
i told you i wouldn &apos;t be here long .
you &apos;re gonna get the door for me ?
oh , i &apos;m not opening the door to be polite .
i &apos;m opening the door so i can see the look on your face
when you see who &apos;s in that room across the hall .
dad ?
what the hell did you do ?
i didn &apos;t do anything .
turns out your father got himself involved
in a shady real estate deal several years ago .
my father has never done anything wrong in his life .
just like mike ross and harvey specter
have never done anything wrong ?
ms. paulsen , maybe you should reassess
the quality of the men in your life .
let me in that room .
sorry , not possible .
but next time you see your father ,
maybe you explain to him you put his life on the line
for the man you work for .
you know , i never thought that i &apos;d say this to another woman ,
but you are a cold , heartless bitch .
i am , and i &apos;ve got a card .
why don &apos;t i just leave that in your purse ?
in case you change your mind
about helping me out with harvey specter .
what are you working on ?
i &apos;m just trying to figure out what gibbs is gonna do next ,
figure out how to fight it .
is there anything i can do to help ?
yeah , you can tell me what your father said
you should do about me .
how would that help ?
because i can &apos;t really focus on this
while i &apos;m worrying about that .
he told me to look in the mirror .
and ?
how do you expect him to react , mike ?
he &apos;s angry and he &apos;s hurt , and--
rachel .
he told me to get rid of you .
good .
why good ?
because you told me that you would stay with me no matter what ,
and when you keep things like that from me ,
it makes me wonder .
but when you tell me and i see that look in your eyes ,
i don &apos;t .
mr. litt , i &apos;m all settled in .
i just wanted to say
that i &apos;m so thrilled to be a part of your te--
yeah , you &apos;re happy as a clam .
let &apos;s get one thing straight .
you may have filled donna &apos;s shoes with harvey ,
but it &apos;s not gonna be that easy filling them with me .
well , if that &apos;s how you want to play it .
i already know that . i heard all about you .
yeah ? from donna ?
from norma .
what ?
you knew norma ?
damn skippy .
played mah @-@ jongg with that woman
every tuesday night for the last 30 years .
mrs. fillstein &apos;s game on 81st street ?
the very one .
i &apos;ve been trying to get into that game forever .
you know she kept you out , right ?
norma did that to me ?
well , i can &apos;t say as i blame her .
said it was her only peaceful night of the week .
30 seconds in , i can see what she means .
but you could turn this around .
play your tiles right with me , i could put in a word for you .
oh , anything you could do would be so appreciated .
yeah . that &apos;s more like it .
i can do even better .
please , make yourself at home . take the day .
well , in that case , i &apos;ll see you tomorrow morning ,
bright and early .
you &apos;re here .
i am .
it &apos;s good to have you back , harvey .
good to be back , donna .
all right , enough sentimentality .
i need you to--
clear your schedule for the next two months ? done .
i also gave half your business to the partners that backed you
and the rest to jessica and louis .
i didn &apos;t ask you to do that .
no , you asked me to come back to your desk .
i sure as hell did .
what &apos;s next ?
what &apos;s next is , get mike into this office ,
and i don &apos;t want him wearing casual clothes ;
i want him with his superman outfit on .
he &apos;s gonna need a hell of a lot more
than a cape and some tights , because i just got
a special delivery from the u.s. attorney &apos;s office .
don &apos;t tell me ; she &apos;s issued subpoenas
for every case mike &apos;s ever touched .
she issued subpoenas for anything
anyone at this firm has ever touched .
what does that mean ?
it means they &apos;re not just after mike anymore .
they &apos;re officially coming after all of us .
mike &apos;s already here . i &apos;ll get him .
i &apos;m telling you , harvey , this move is no joke .
that woman gets in the door , she will find something
to pressure someone into saying whatever she wants ,
and i &apos;ll be damned if i &apos;ll let her rifle through my house .
what exactly are you saying ?
i &apos;m saying we need outside counsel .
absolutely not . there &apos;s nobody we can trust .
there is one person we can trust ,
because you already told her mike &apos;s goddamn secret .
jessica , i am not bringing scottie into this thing .
i &apos;m telling you i can handle this .
you don &apos;t even have a strategy to stop these subpoenas .
well , then i guess it &apos;s a good thing i do .
well , then why don &apos;t you stop patting yourself on the back
and start telling me what the hell it is ?
we go on offense .
what exactly does that mean ?
it means that we don &apos;t have to prove
that she can &apos;t subpoena our records ;
she has to prove that she can .
and she doesn &apos;t have a shred of evidence
proving that you knew about me .
if she got those subpoenas in the first place ,
she must have something .
wrong , i worked in the d.a. &apos; s office for five years .
judges give out subpoenas like candy .
then i suggest the two of you get the hell on down there
and take that woman &apos;s candy away .
the fact is , your honor , she has no grounds
to even issue these things in the first place .
what is he even doing here ?
i &apos;m here because i &apos;m a lawyer
and i &apos;m innocent until proven guilty .
and those subpoenas aren &apos;t about coming after me ;
they &apos;re about coming after him .
you &apos;re damn right they are , because there &apos;s no way
he didn &apos;t know you &apos;re a fraud .
where exactly is your evidence of either one of those things ?
i see . they &apos;re not trying to fight these subpoenas .
they &apos;re trying to get me to turn over whatever evidence i have ,
which i don &apos;t have to do for another three weeks .
you &apos;ll do whatever i say you have to do .
now , i want to know what started this whole thing .
we received an anonymous email from a reputable source .
yeah , and a stranger called me the other day
saying you killed six people .
can i subpoena her bank records ?
you think this is a joke ?
you &apos;re damn right this isn &apos;t a joke .
i &apos;m being accused of a crime based on some bullshit email
no one &apos;s even seen .
i &apos;d ask if you have that email on you , ms. gibbs ,
but i wouldn &apos;t want to put you in the position of lying to me ,
so let &apos;s have it .
this is from a general harvard faculty address .
it is . we are working on tracking down the sender .
well , you &apos;d better find them ,
because without corroborating testimony ,
i &apos;ll not only quash these subpoenas ;
i &apos;ll toss the entire case .
son of a bitch . it &apos;s henry gerard .
harvey , if gerard was gonna say something ,
why would he wait until now ?
i don &apos;t know , but it &apos;s the only goddamn person
it could be .
all right , then i &apos;m gonna go see him .
and do what ?
i &apos;m gonna get to him before gibbs does ,
get him to recant .
this isn &apos;t testimony .
it &apos;s a tip to a crime you actually committed .
i don &apos;t care . we have leverage on gerard .
were you in there ?
this woman has her sights on both of us .
you go up to boston , she &apos;s gonna have people
crawling all over harvard ,
and you &apos;re gonna be the one who led her to gerard .
i can &apos;t just sit here and wait for the sword to drop .
wait a second .
you can &apos;t go there , i can &apos;t go there ,
but i know someone who can .
jessica .
i was wondering when you were gonna show up at my door .
so you &apos;ve heard about mike ross .
oh , everybody &apos;s heard about mike ross .
now i finally know what you were hiding from me the whole time .
but what i don &apos;t know is how the hell
you let something like this happen in the first place .
we &apos;ll talk about that in a minute .
but i &apos;m not just here to apologize
for what happened between us .
i &apos;m here to ask for your help .
you want me to represent the firm .
if it comes to it , i want you to represent me .
you got a lot of nerve coming in here to ask me that .
jeff , please .
i made the mistake of not trusting you once .
i don &apos;t want to make that same mistake again .
then you &apos;re gonna have to tell me the truth about everything
right now , and it &apos;s not gonna be protected
by attorney @-@ client privilege ,
and you &apos;re gonna have to trust that i &apos;m not gonna turn you in .
i was never worried that you were gonna turn me in .
i was worried about putting you in a position
where you had to lie .
but i was ready to tell you that night anyway ,
so i might as well tell you now .
rachel , what &apos;s going on ?
i just got a call .
they took donna down to the u.s. attorney &apos;s office .
we have to get down there right now .
no , we don &apos;t . i &apos;m gonna take care of her .
you go ahead and do what we were gonna do together .
harvey , donna getting taken in changes everything .
it changes nothing , so stop talking to me
and do what you have to do .
it was henry gerard .
what ?
the person who handed me in was henry gerard .
it was an anonymous email .
no way . how would he even know that you &apos;re not a lawyer ?
that case we took last year , he figured it out .
well , then why would he wait to turn you in now ?
i don &apos;t know , but what i do know is ,
you need to get up there and you need to get him to take it back .
how the hell am i supposed to do that ?
that &apos;s what you and i are gonna figure out right now .
wait a second . where &apos;s harvey ?
he &apos;s got an important meeting that--
what could be more important than this ?
louis , it &apos;s a personal matter--
where is he ?
they brought donna in for questioning .
goddamn it , this is what i was afraid of .
i &apos;m heading down there right now .
louis--louis , listen to me .
they &apos;re gonna try and put pressure on donna
to turn on harvey , and the best way
to make that pressure go away is to make gerard go away ,
which can make this whole case go away .
give me the goddamn email .
now , before you go up there , we &apos;re gonna--
i &apos;m sorry . wait a second .
why would someone who knows you &apos;re guilty
call you a &quot; potential &quot; fraud ?
i @-@ i don &apos;t know .
he &apos;s trying to cover his ass somehow .
&quot; a potential fraud besmirching the sacrosanct name
of hallowed harvard university &quot; --
louis , we really don &apos;t have time for this . please .
mike , i know who wrote this email .
it &apos;s not henry gerard .
excuse me , miss .
are you alone , or can an old man pull up a seat ?
hi , dad .
so have you looked over the deal ?
i have .
and you see the potential i &apos;m talking about ?
it &apos;s a great project .
but ?
i &apos;m not sure how wise it is
for you to get back into development .
i understand you would feel that way
after what it did to you , but--
i feel that way because of what it did to you .
donna , i told you .
the banks are crazy for this kind of thing right now .
all i need is $ 250,000 .
i can get a loan five times the size .
i don &apos;t know ; that just sounds really risky .
aren &apos;t you always telling me that harvey says
if you want to get ahead , you need to take risks ?
that &apos;s why you came to me .
you &apos;re not looking for my money ; you &apos;re looking for harvey &apos;s .
it would just be to secure the loan .
after the bank gives me the money , he &apos;s free and clear .
harvey &apos;s never gonna go for that .
i mean , even i know that &apos;s not legal .
donna , people do this kind of thing all the time .
it &apos;s a sleight of hand , nothing more .
dad , you &apos;re doing fine .
do you really need to risk everything again ?
donna , i manage a real estate office .
everybody there makes more . everybody there is doing better .
i used to be better .
i know i can do this .
please , all you have to do is ask harvey .
if he says no , he says no .
dad , i &apos;m so sorry .
don &apos;t worry , sweetie .
people have tried to rattle my cage plenty of times .
it &apos;s never worked before , and it &apos;s not gonna work now .
that &apos;s what i told her . you &apos;re gonna be okay .
donna , can you give us a minute ?
harvey ...
yeah ?
they &apos;re saying this has to do with that deal
i talked to you about seven years ago .
and ?
is there something you &apos;re not telling me ?
the only thing i haven &apos;t told you
is that i &apos;m gonna get him out of this , no matter what .
what the hell did you do ?
what are you talking about ?
they didn &apos;t bring you in here
if you didn &apos;t do something seven years ago ,
and if i &apos;m gonna get you out of this ,
i need to know what you did .
i did what everybody else did .
i inflated my collateral because you shut me down ,
so don &apos;t come in here telling me this is my fault .
i shut you down to protect donna
from getting involved in exactly something like this .
this is on you , not on me .
well , aren &apos;t you high and mighty ,
coming in here accusing me of putting my daughter at risk
when the whole reason she &apos;s in the position she &apos;s in
is because of something you did ?
that &apos;s right .
they told me this is because they &apos;re trying
to get donna to testify against you ,
and they want me to help them get her to do it .
then why don &apos;t you ?
because i know it would kill her ,
and no matter what you may think ,
i would never do anything to hurt my daughter .
did you talk to donna ?
i talked to harvey , and he said it &apos;s gonna be f--
i don &apos;t care what he says .
what are they coming after her for ?
mike , harvey asked me not to--
rachel , what are they coming after her for ?
they &apos;re not coming after her for anything .
they &apos;re coming after her father .
what ?
turns out he was involved in some sort of real estate deal
and they &apos;re saying it wasn &apos;t on the up @-@ and @-@ up .
goddamn it !
mike , calm down . it &apos;s nothing .
harvey &apos;s gonna get them out of it .
look , it &apos;s really just a minor violation ,
and no one would even care if it weren &apos;t for--
me . you were just about to say if it weren &apos;t for me .
mike , i--
that &apos;s it .
i &apos;m pleading guilty .
i &apos;m gonna take the reduced sentence ,
i &apos;m gonna do the time , and all of this
is gonna go away once and for all .
that &apos;s not an option , and you know it .
the only reason they went after donna &apos;s dad
is to get to harvey and jessica .
if you plead guilty , all you &apos;re gonna do is help them do that ,
so you &apos;re either gonna turn on the two of them
or you &apos;re gonna fight this thing out till the end .
we need to talk .
about what ?
about what we &apos;re going to do
if that prosecutor gets a hold of those subpoenas .
you mean what we &apos;re gonna do about the letter that mike has
that proves you knew he was a fraud .
yes , that &apos;s what i mean .
i &apos;m assuming you were smart enough
to destroy that thing the second they let you out .
and i &apos;m assuming you destroyed the affidavit
that you had rachel sign saying she knew the truth about me .
i didn &apos;t ,
but i had the same conversation with louis , we worked it out ,
and i &apos;m here to tell you
i will get rid of mine if you get rid of yours .
i knew it ; you &apos;re actually considering
turning your back on me and harvey .
i &apos;m not turning my back on anyone ,
but we both know you &apos;ve done some things
that make me question whether or not i can trust you .
well , then , the least you can do
is find the time to speak with my attorney
before that ruling comes down .
your attorney ?
i &apos;m sure you &apos;ve heard of him .
his name &apos;s jeff malone .
you &apos;re even lower than i thought you were ,
and i didn &apos;t even think that was possible .
coming from someone with your moral compass ,
i take that as a compliment .
what gives you the right
to come after my secretary &apos;s father ?
i &apos;m not the one prosecuting him .
it just so happens that one of my colleagues
is going after him on a completely unrelated matter .
bullshit , the only reason you &apos;re doing this
is to put pressure on donna to come after me .
well , now that you mention it , the judge did say
i needed something tying you to mike ross &apos;s fraud
in order to get those subpoenas ,
and maybe that something is donna paulsen .
i should ask her .
you already did ask her ,
and now you &apos;re manufacturing
a bullshit case against an innocent man ,
and i &apos;m gonna make sure you pay for it .
he &apos;s not in here because of what i did .
he &apos;s in here because of what you did .
so instead of blaming me , take a look in the mirror ,
&apos;cause all you have to do is admit what you did ,
and all of this goes away .
louis .
what are you doing here ?
you know why i &apos;m here .
i &apos;m here because of this .
i don &apos;t know what that is .
please , your language is all over it .
you might as well have signed your name .
what i want to know is why .
i got a call about an article
on mike ross &apos;s meteoric rise to junior partner .
problem is , i remember every student that &apos;s ever gone here ,
and there is no mike ross ,
so i double @-@ checked my file room ,
and then i sent this .
sheila , you are messing with my firm .
why didn &apos;t you come to me first ?
because it didn &apos;t occur to me that i had to .
that is bullshit !
you reported it anonymously
because you didn &apos;t want to look bad .
you didn &apos;t trust me to keep you out of it .
no , i reported it anonymously
because i was ashamed that it happened on my watch ,
but i &apos;m not gonna stand by while somebody besmirches
the good name of harvard university .
you have no proof that mike ross besmirched anything .
why are you defending this lowlife ?
because if you &apos;d come to me first ,
i could have stopped this whole thing from happening .
oh , my god .
you knew .
sheila , please , you don &apos;t know him like i know him .
what exactly are you doing here , louis ?
i want you to retract that email .
tell &apos; em that you made a mistake ; you found the file .
i can &apos;t do that .
sheila , please .
when we broke up , i forced myself to accept it ,
because ultimately i knew we wanted different things ,
but it killed me ,
because i also knew that we were soul mates .
but the fact that you &apos;re asking me to do this ...
we are not soul mates .
i &apos;m begging you .
at least don &apos;t come forward .
i never was gonna come forward , louis .
now leave me alone .
i thought i &apos;d find you here .
how are you doing ?
well , they &apos;re coming after my father
for something he didn &apos;t do .
how do you think i &apos;m doing ?
i &apos;m sorry . do you want to be alone ?
no . i &apos;m sorry . it &apos;s just--
donna , please , you &apos;re worried sick
for someone you love .
i get it .
it &apos;s just , last year my life was in harvey &apos;s hands ,
and he told me that my worrying about what would happen
if he lost would only make it more likely for him to lose .
i know , and you can &apos;t help but worry about it ,
because it &apos;s your father .
no , i can &apos;t .
and you can &apos;t help wondering ,
if it comes down to it , what will you do ?
what ?
no , rachel , how can you even ask me that ?
i get it .
because if it comes down to it ,
you want mike to consider turning on harvey .
that &apos;s not what i said .
you know , if you &apos;re just here to get me
to think about doing that , i don &apos;t need that right now .
no , no , no , donna , i came in here
because i care about you and i am--
i &apos;m sorry that i even brought it up .
are you sorry ?
excuse me ?
do you think that i don &apos;t know
that all your problems are solved
if i tell them that harvey did this ?
no , donna , all of my problems are solved if mike tells them .
but , yes , my life gets a whole lot better
if harvey takes responsibility for what he did .
what he did was give mike a chance
to make something of himself .
which is why mike &apos;s never gonna turn on him .
but you know what ?
i would be lying if i said it didn &apos;t cross my mind
that maybe mike should think about making a deal .
and you can &apos;t tell me that since they picked up your father
that the thought hasn &apos;t crossed yours too .
well , thinking about it and talking about it
aren &apos;t the same thing ,
and right now , i &apos;m focusing on having faith in harvey .
louis , what the hell ?
i &apos;ve been looking for you all morning .
what happened ?
it was her .
and ?
she &apos;s not gonna retract the email .
shit . what did she say ?
oh , what the hell do you think she said ?
said she knows you &apos;re a fraud ,
she &apos;s not gonna take it back ,
and now that she &apos;s figured out that i &apos;ve been a part of it ,
she can &apos;t stand the sight of me .
all right , then we need to think of something else--
oh , did you just hear what i just said ?
she can &apos;t stand the sight of me .
louis , i know you &apos;re feeling bad ,
but right now , donna is under the gun .
what do you want me to do about that ?
i don &apos;t know , but if she doesn &apos;t retract that email
and they find her--
no , they &apos;re not gonna find her ,
because she sent it from a general faculty email
because she &apos;s ashamed of herself like she &apos;s ashamed of me .
and this is all your fault ,
so get the hell out of my office
instead of trying to figure out a way
to cover your goddamn ass !
you can believe this or not , louis ,
but right this second ,
i &apos;m actually looking out for donna .
i &apos;m sorry , mike .
right this second , i cannot help you .
good , you &apos;re here .
listen , i need you to take care of--
before we get to the game plan ,
i need to know what &apos;s going on with donna &apos;s father .
i &apos;m taking care of it .
did you get louis to go see gerard ?
it wasn &apos;t gerard . it was sheila sazs .
you gotta be kidding me .
louis told his girlfriend about you ?
no , harvey , you told your girlfriend about me .
louis risked his neck to get sheila
to take that email back to save our asses .
what are you so bent out of shape for ?
i &apos;m bent out of shape because he couldn &apos;t do it ,
and on top of that , donna &apos;s dad is only in this mess
because of what we did , and you won &apos;t let me help .
that &apos;s right , mike ; i won &apos;t let you help ,
because you &apos;re under investigation
for being a fraud .
you &apos;re under investigation too ,
there &apos;s nothing to be ashamed of ,
then let &apos;s act like there &apos;s nothing to be ashamed of .
okay , that &apos;s all well and good , mike ,
but i &apos;m the one representing donna &apos;s father , not you ,
which means i &apos;m the only one with a credible reason
to pay a visit to the banker that gave him
that shitty loan in the first place .
harvey , this is killing me !
i have to do something .
right now , the best thing you can do
is think about what we &apos;re gonna do
if they put it together about louis &apos;s girlfriend ,
because if they find her , we &apos;re in deep shit .
how did you find me here ?
i remember every game you have
from our work on your case .
and i knew i had to find you at a place
where we couldn &apos;t be bothered by anyone from harvard .
because everyone from harvard now knows you didn &apos;t go there .
which is why i need someone from harvard
to tell them that i did .
are you crazy ?
no , i &apos;m smart .
all they have is an anonymous tip
and no corroborating evidence .
you sign this affidavit saying that i was in your class ,
their whole case gets dismissed .
and what if it doesn &apos;t ?
then i go to trial .
this is reasonable doubt .
i get acquitted , they can never try me again .
or it &apos;s not reasonable doubt , you don &apos;t get acquitted ,
and i go to jail for perjury .
i remember when you were willing to commit perjury
and we didn &apos;t just stop you ; we saved your ass .
i don &apos;t care . i &apos;m not risking everything for you .
this isn &apos;t just for me , all right ?
they are coming after everyone that i care about .
i feel for you , mike ,
which is why i never turned you in in the first place ,
but i can &apos;t do what you &apos;re asking .
and what if i anonymously told harvard
that you took a bribe from a student for a grade ?
you willing to bet everything that i won &apos;t do that ?
you do what you have to do ,
but i &apos;m not putting my life in jeopardy
by signing that goddamn thing .
wait a minute , wait , wait .
what if i had a way that you could help me
without having to perjure yourself ?
and how exactly would i do that ?
it &apos;s right in your wheelhouse .
we &apos;re playing poker too .
i just--
i just need you to help me bluff .
harvey , i need to ask you to do something .
of course , donna . i &apos;d do anything for you .
well , it isn &apos;t for me . it &apos;s for my father .
he wanted to know if you would consider
investing in his real estate project .
i &apos;m sorry . i can &apos;t do that .
you just said that you would do anything for me .
i meant i &apos;d consider anything , and i just did .
you haven &apos;t even looked at it .
i don &apos;t need to .
you &apos;re family to me , he &apos;s family to you ,
and you don &apos;t invest money with family .
that &apos;s not what you said when marcus needed money
for his restaurant .
that &apos;s different .
why ?
because marcus actually knew what the hell he was doing .
you know what , harvey ? if you don &apos;t want to invest , don &apos;t invest ,
but i don &apos;t need a lecture from you
on what a bad businessman my father is .
yes , you do .
oh , really ? why &apos;s that ?
because if i know you ,
you &apos;re thinking of giving him access to your 401k .
so ? what if i am ?
donna , this man lost your family &apos;s money once .
you &apos;re gonna give him the chance to do it again ?
harvey , this man is my father ,
and he has been there for me my whole life .
and i know what happened between you and your mother ,
but don &apos;t you judge him for what she did .
how dare you ? this has nothing to do with that .
you have a blind spot when it comes to him .
i &apos;m trying to protect you .
well , you &apos;re not . you &apos;re being an asshole .
and for your information , keeping me from being there
for my father isn &apos;t protecting me .
it &apos;s pissing me the hell off .
good , donna , you &apos;re here . look , i need you to--
the only thing i need is for you to tell me what you did ,
because i just found out that they &apos;re
formally charging my father with bank fraud tomorrow .
goddamn it .
what did you do ?
all i did was strong @-@ arm a banker .
and why the hell would you need to strong @-@ arm a banker ?
because he had evidence that needed to get lost .
i knew there was something you weren &apos;t telling me .
what the hell happened seven years ago ?
what happened is , you came to me
asking a favor for your father , so i went to him
asking a favor of my own .
bullshit . you don &apos;t ask people for favors .
you force them to do things !
you &apos;re goddamn right i do .
i told your father if he took your money ,
i &apos;d pull every string i have to shut his deal down .
you had no right to do that .
i don &apos;t care if i had a right to do it or not .
i wasn &apos;t gonna let you lose everything
just because you couldn &apos;t see the truth about him .
the truth is , you went behind my back ,
and then he did something illegal ,
and now i have to choose between you and him
because of what you did !
what i did was keep you
from being involved in this mess .
no , harvey , what you did was start this mess
the day you went ahead and hired a fraud .
what happened ?
they &apos;re formally charging donna &apos;s father ,
and we need to figure out a way to get his case thrown out .
well , then we have to get my case thrown out ,
because then they won &apos;t care about donna &apos;s dad .
and how the hell are we gonna do that ?
i went to see gerard .
god damn it , didn &apos;t i tell you not to do that ?
that was before we knew he wasn &apos;t the one
that tipped them off .
if he wasn &apos;t the one who tipped them off ,
what the hell did you go to him for ?
i went to him for this .
this is a vaguely worded statement .
it doesn &apos;t even specifically say you went to harvard .
it doesn &apos;t have to .
it says that he &apos;s known me to be an amazing lawyer ,
that i &apos;ve shown mastery of the material that he teaches ,
and that as far as he &apos;s concerned ,
i &apos;m an outstanding student of the law .
it &apos;s total bullshit .
it &apos;s not total bullshit , all right ?
if they don &apos;t find sheila and we do this ,
we could get the whole case thrown out .
gibbs &apos;ll see right through this .
she &apos;ll put gerard on the stand ,
and she &apos;ll ask him point blank
if he knows for a fact that you never went to harvard ,
and we &apos;ll have signed our own death warrant .
she &apos;s not gonna do that , because it violates
the number one rule of being a lawyer that you taught me :
don &apos;t ask a question that you don &apos;t have the answer to .
it &apos;s too big a risk .
harvey , donna &apos;s dad is at risk ,
and he &apos;s at risk because of me .
the only way to get him out is to have me to turn on you
or for us to get this whole thing thrown out ,
so are you on board with this or not ?
we better pray this bullshit works ,
because , if it doesn &apos;t , at least one of us
is gonna end up in prison tomorrow .
all right , what are we doing here ?
your honor , we have a motion
to dismiss mike ross &apos;s case .
on what grounds ?
on the grounds that i have a letter here
from professor henry gerard of harvard law
saying that mike ross was in his class .
this is ridiculous .
even if mr. ross were in that class ,
it doesn &apos;t mean he was matriculated .
you still haven &apos;t shown any evidence that he wasn &apos;t ,
which is why that document should get this case dismissed .
this document is
a cryptically worded piece of shit ,
and you &apos;re a man who has a reputation
for crossing the line .
ms. gibbs , language . what are you implying ?
your honor , there &apos;s a good chance
he coerced this professor gerard into signing this thing .
so our exhibits are all from blackmail ,
but yours are squeaky clean because you &apos;re mother teresa ?
i may not be mother teresa ,
but i don &apos;t resort to coercion to get my evidence .
then what exactly are you doing
with donna paulsen &apos;s father ?
care to tell me what he &apos;s talking about ?
i &apos;ll tell you . she fabricated a charge
against an innocent businessman to pressure my secretary
into giving false testimony against me .
your honor , it &apos;s standard practice
to find leverage against a vital witness .
oh , is it also standard practice to have
a federal marshal rough me up in a holding cell ?
ms. gibbs , if i find out there &apos;s an abuse of power here ,
i will be switching my focus to you .
then before you rule on their motion ,
the state has the right
to question this professor gerard .
your honor , can ms. gibbs and i have a minute alone ?
please .
you think i don &apos;t know this letter is complete bullshit ?
i pull this clown up on the stand ,
he &apos;s gonna tell me the truth in a minute .
okay , this clown is one of
the most distinguished ethics professors in the country .
you put him up there , this case is over for you
before you even get started .
then why the hell isn &apos;t he here right now
verifying this thing ?
because that kid cares more about donna paulsen
than he does about himself .
what do you want ?
i want to make a deal-- that letter for donna &apos;s father .
this is too good for you .
if you really had gerard , he &apos;d be down here right now .
if it were up to me , he &apos;d be down here right now ,
but this is mike &apos;s call .
this is a one @-@ time offer , and the clock &apos;s ticking .
you still get to go to trial ,
we get donna and her father off limits ,
and we both live to fight another day .
i want my subpoenas too .
no way . judge said no .
you try to pull this thing out at trial ,
i will rip your professor friend to shreds .
your honor , ms. gibbs and i have come to an agreement .
she &apos;s dropping all charges against james paulsen ,
and we withdraw our motion to dismiss .
see you next week .
nice club .
are you new ?
just visiting . not much of a golfer .
unfortunately , neither am i.
harvey specter .
jim paulsen .
i assume this is about the opportunity
donna brought you .
it &apos;d be an opportunity if the numbers added up , jim ,
but they don &apos;t .
i don &apos;t understand .
i thought you were the type of man
that was willing to take risks .
i am--
but not if it puts people i care about in jeopardy ,
which is why i &apos;m here to tell you
that when donna offers you her 401k ,
you &apos;re gonna tell her you don &apos;t need it anymore .
no offense , mr. specter , but what my daughter does
with her money is none of your business .
well , it became my business when donna put you
so far up on a pedestal that she couldn &apos;t smell
the bullshit you were dishing out .
it &apos;s not bullshit .
yes , it is . i looked at that deal .
there &apos;s no way you &apos;re getting the kind of money you need
without doing something shady .
inflating my assets to get a loan isn &apos;t shady .
everybody does it .
that &apos;s what everybody thinks until the music stops ,
which is why if you involve donna in this deal ,
so help me god , i will pull every string i have
to tie your project up in court for the next 20 years .
i &apos;m just trying to make my way .
all i &apos;m telling you is , you can make it without donna .
you act as if you think i don &apos;t love my own daughter .
people who love other people
don &apos;t put them in positions to break the law .
i just got off the phone with my dad .
he told me the good news .
i told you i &apos;d take care of it .
what did you do ?
it &apos;s not important .
harvey .
we withdrew our motion to dismiss mike &apos;s case
in exchange for her leaving you alone .
so i hurt mike &apos;s case .
no , you didn &apos;t .
the whole thing was based on a bluff
that never would have held up anyway .
this way , we at least got something for it .
thank you , harvey .
and i &apos;m sorry for what i said .
no .
you were right to say it .
i never should have put you in this position , donna .
if you want to go back to work for louis , i &apos;ll understand .
no , you shouldn &apos;t have put me in that position ,
but if i was gonna leave you for hiring mike ,
the time to do that would have been years ago .
i hope i &apos;m not interrupting your premature celebration .
you better not be reneging on our deal .
oh , no , i &apos;m gonna honor it .
i just dropped by to serve you with these .
you and your partners are hereby subpoenaed
to hand over every single document in the entire firm .
no .
no way the judge granted that
just because we withdrew our motion to dismiss .
she didn &apos;t .
she granted it when a sheila sazs from harvard
came forward and said she wrote that anonymous email .
that &apos;s right , mr. specter .
your chances of winning this case just took
a mighty big turn for the worse .
what are you doing here ?
you never came to see me ,
so i thought i would come to you
and find out why you &apos;re so willing
to let all those dangerous letters
just keep floating around out there .
i think you mean letters that are dangerous to your client .
well , i &apos;m holding one right here
that puts your woman in a world of trouble , mike ,
so no , no , i don &apos;t .
oh , i get it .
i didn &apos;t crumble to jessica , so now you &apos;re here
to take a shot at strong @-@ arming me into a trade .
no , see , i came to see why ,
when the woman that &apos;s been protecting you for so long
asks you for a simple gesture of trust ,
you seem to think that
all she &apos;s doing is protecting herself .
because she is protecting herself .
you &apos;re goddamn right that &apos;s what she &apos;s doing ,
but that &apos;s not all she &apos;s doing ,
because from the second that she found out about you ,
she &apos;s had to lie for you ,
and she still treated you like family ,
and it cost her everything .
give me a break . until now , it didn &apos;t cost her anything .
you better watch yourself .
what the hell are you doing ?
it cost her her relationship with me !
you didn &apos;t know about that , did you ?
well , now you do .
so you &apos;ll destroy that if i give you mine ?
i &apos;m an attorney . i can &apos;t destroy evidence .
but you ? you can do whatever you want .
you trust me to do that ?
no , mike .
jessica does .
louis , i need you to sit down .
what is it ? what happened ?
is your father okay ? i &apos;ll go down there right now .
he &apos;s fine . harvey took care of it .
oh , well , then i don &apos;t need to sit down .
&apos;cause whatever it is , if you &apos;re okay , i &apos;ll be okay .
sheila came forward .
what ?
she admitted she was the one to write the email .
that &apos;s not possible .
she promised me she wouldn &apos;t do that .
i &apos;m sorry , louis , but she did .
i need to be alone .
louis , i don &apos;t think this is the time for you to--
i said get out .
he did it ?
he did .
what did you say to him ?
i told him how much it cost you ,
and then i did what we talked about .
well , it &apos;s a good thing you did ,
because those subpoenas just came down .
jessica , i don &apos;t know that i &apos;ve ever been
much of a spiritual person ,
but i would be lying if i didn &apos;t admit
that sometimes i think god has a plan .
what are you saying ?
i &apos;m saying that maybe he &apos;s trying to show you
that there &apos;s more to life than
pearson specter litt .
i &apos;m not gonna be your attorney on this one .
i think you can find someone better .
no .
i trust you , and there &apos;s no way
i find someone that i trust more .
then find me when this is all over ,
and we &apos;ll see if we can put that trust to better use .
gretchen , whatever it is , it can wait till tomorrow .
this can &apos;t wait .
i want to apologize to you .
for what ?
when jack soloff nominated mike ross for partner ,
i know it hurt harvey a little ,
because he wanted to be the one to do it ,
so i called the &quot; aba journal &quot;
to write an article about mike .
i wanted to surprise harvey with it .
you &apos;re saying the article that tipped sheila off was you ?
yes .
why are you telling me this ?
because i &apos;m sorry .
and if anyone ever asks , i &apos;ll deny ever saying this ,
but ... i know you all knew .
and i &apos;m with you .
what &apos;s the matter ?
i know i said i don &apos;t want you to keep things from me ,
but i don &apos;t want to keep things from you either .
what are you keeping from me ?
it &apos;s actually good and bad news .
we had a chance to get this whole case thrown out today ,
and it didn &apos;t work , but we did get donna off ,
and for the first time , i actually started to believe
we can get out of this thing .
and why were you afraid to admit that to me ?
because i didn &apos;t want to get your hopes up .
and i didn &apos;t really believe it before .
yeah , what &apos;s up ?
sheila sazs came forward ,
which means they &apos;re gonna try and pit us all
against each other even more .
