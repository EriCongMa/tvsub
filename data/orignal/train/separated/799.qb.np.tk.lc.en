jess , where are you ? it &apos;s jacob &apos;s first birthday .
you &apos;re his godmother , i need you here .
sir , hi . who are you ?
this is a private residence .
i &apos;ll be right there .
hey , nick . it &apos;s me , jess .
i have really bad news .
we have to go to a one @-@ year @-@ old &apos;s birthday party .
i &apos;m not interested in that birthday party .
thank you for the invitation .
good night .
i &apos;m so hungover .
why today ?
what ?
you think it went bad ?
we &apos;re your new neighbors .
um , i think y @-@ your bagel fell out of your mouth .
i &apos;m jewish .
why didn &apos;t you guys tell me
i was still wearing ladies &apos; sunglasses ?
i look like magic johnson &apos;s son , ej .
hey , you guys , i got a problem .
you know that guy that i &apos;m dating ?
buster , your child bride ?
he &apos;s 20 , okay ? not that it matters .
is he smooth all over ?
does he take baths in the sink ?
i sent him a bunch of drunk texts last night .
what ?
oh , dear lord .
i know .
&quot; i miss the way that your hands smell &quot; ?
did you write an entire jewel song in here ?
is it from pieces of you ?
you want to buy a rabbit with him ?
this isn &apos;t a text message--
it &apos;s a freaking russian novel .
okay , well , you know what , what do i do ?
text him one of the little yellow men . the @-@ the emoticons .
you know , with the ... with the fa ... with the faces .
i hate all of you .
okay , so we really
tanked it with those babes .
look , we need to orchestrate a situation
which allows us to put our best foot forward .
that &apos;s easy . we help &apos; em move .
winston . winston ... shh .
why ? it makes perfect sense .
helping a girl move makes you
come off as a doormat , you know what i mean ?
honey , honey , honey , just ...
listen to coach .
baby , look ,
let us handle this , okay ?
you go help cece deal with the text messages .
you know , maybe i will .
okay .
but only because i really do enjoy helping people .
you &apos;re gonna be great , buddy .
you &apos;re gonna do good things , man .
you think we were too harsh on him ?
he makes you . he does .
don &apos;t blame yourself .
how the hell did this happen ?
i found some things and i put them on .
throw this on .
okay .
cover up the tops .
you look great .
no .
i couldn &apos;t have done it without you .
no , you &apos;re ...
you &apos;re getting emotional . you do this when you &apos;re hungover ,
but i &apos;m gonna need you to stay focused
so we can get to that party .
yeah . we just need the gift .
yeah .
i got the gift .
all right .
why is it in the box ?
it &apos;s supposed to be out of the box , assembled .
i said i would put it together before the party ,
and it &apos;s before the party . so what &apos;s the problem ?
just give me five minutes .
ten minutes , tops .
but i got this thing .
this is it .
christmas morning .
our little guy waiting by the fireplace ,
but there &apos;s no gift .
&apos;cause daddy &apos;s in the other room putting it together .
did you say &quot; our &quot; kid ?
yeah , sometimes i think about
what our kid would be like .
don &apos;t you ?
yeah .
you don &apos;t think about the future ?
can we not talk about this right now ?
six hours ago , i was lapping cognac out of winston &apos;s hands .
drink it up , checkers . forget what you saw .
never talk about anything serious when you &apos;re hungover , jess .
i don &apos;t even really think about it that much .
i just think about , you know , passing things . just ...
nothing specific . we live in a house by a lake .
that sounds pretty specific .
we live in a town with a sense of history
but not so much history
that the locals are suspicious of new people .
two small children
who are so incredibly creative they named themselves .
we don &apos;t need to discipline the kids
&apos;cause they &apos;re so afraid of disappointing us .
our house smells like cider .
and if there &apos;s a horse out back ,
you &apos;re not gonna get any guff from me .
anyway , that &apos;s where i &apos;m at .
what are you ... what are you thinking ?
what , um ...
where do you picture us ?
where do you ... nick .
nick .
oh , god .
i still feel like crap .
guys , will you , um , look at this follow @-@ up text
that i &apos;m sending to buster , please ?
it &apos;s for the little boy ?
try to be helpful , okay ?
what are we looking at here ?
are those ... nursing cats ?
winston said it was funny .
it &apos;s not . it &apos;s incoherent .
no .
it &apos;s borderline pornographic .
wait , those are not cats . that &apos;s a human man !
oh ! what is he suck ... what is he sucking on ?
what web sites are you going to ?
what are you guys doing out here ?
obviously we &apos;re creating an accidental bump @-@ in
with our hot new neighbors .
elevator &apos;s on the move .
you got to go . you &apos;re too hot .
you &apos;ll confuse them .
yes , well , of course . it &apos;s my garden party ,
and zachary quinto is not on the list .
um , you sure you can handle that , winston ?
i &apos;m fine . i &apos;m fine . ooh .
are you sure ?
i &apos;m fine . i &apos;m fine .
to the right a little bit . up right .
son of a bitch .
okay . thank you so much .
we &apos;ll get you some nice cold lemonade after this , okay ?
ooh , be careful .
oh ! good lord .
you know what , we don &apos;t have to talk about the future .
let &apos;s just put this toy together .
i want to talk about the future .
okay .
i would love to talk about it .
great . all right .
yes , great .
i always thought it would be cool to be a long @-@ haul trucker .
you want to be a long @-@ haul trucker with a family ?
no , the family would be in montana . or @-@ or mars landing ,
you know , if the government finally steps up .
where is mars landing ?
where is mars landing ? it &apos;s on m ... it &apos;s on mars .
it &apos;s the american capital of mars .
and if you don &apos;t think
there &apos;s gonna be space travel in the next 20 years ,
then you &apos;ve got your head
buried in sand , girlie .
i ...
it &apos;s already basically happening .
i always thought i &apos;d move back to portland .
oh . portland , earth ?
it &apos;s like friendly san francisco .
slow food ,
fast bicycles ,
great schools ...
education is very important to me .
that makes me happy .
it &apos;s something we agree on .
i really want my kids to beg for it .
what ?
&apos;cause if you force a kid into school , he &apos;s gonna hate it .
oh , no .
if you make a kid work
and sit in the yard and grind and grind
and grind ...
what ?
... eventually , that little kid
is gonna beg for education .
then you hand it to them
like the gift that it should be .
no !
that &apos;s why public school &apos;s a joke .
i &apos;m so hung over ,
and my body &apos;s shutting down
and nothing you &apos;re saying makes any sense .
there is something serious i have to tell you
about the future .
the name of my firstborn child
has to be reginald veljohnson .
i lost a bet to schmidt .
reginald veljohnson ?
that is non @-@ negotiable . unfortunately .
the dad from family matters ?
well , the actor who plays the dad .
the dad is carl winslow .
what was the bet on ?
i said i could flip a big pancake ...
... and i couldn &apos;t .
how is this going to work ? !
the only upside is
the original name was gonna be ass baby ,
and i kind of talked my way out of that one .
all of the guys in this building are so sweet .
it &apos;s no problem , yeah .
couldn &apos;t be easier , really .
just a p ... piece of cake .
we love it .
you know , it was my idea to help move .
the only reason we &apos;re doing this is because you forced us to .
if we don &apos;t help now , we &apos;ll look bad .
yeah , now they &apos;re gonna think of us
as &quot; nice &quot; and &quot; helpful . &quot; nightmare .
oh , cool !
uh ... your brother ?
actually , it &apos;s my boyfriend .
yet he &apos;s not here to help you move .
he &apos;s out of the country .
afghanistan . second tour .
please thank him for ,
uh , for his service .
yeah .
are you and your boyfriend
and michelle and her boyfriend gonna go on a , like ,
double date kind of thing
whenever he gets back from afghanistan ?
she doesn &apos;t have a boyfriend .
she &apos;s not really the relationship type .
oh . okay .
i &apos;m just having fun right now .
i feel you . i feel you .
no .
girl , i want to feel you ...
and then there was one .
may the best man win .
i am also involved in this .
winston , get out of here .
what is your problem ?
and then there were three guys ...
here &apos;s what i &apos;m saying :
reginald is way too shy
to beg for an education .
he &apos;s very sensitive , and when he &apos;s out on the horse ,
all he &apos;s doing is staring at leaves
and writing poems about them .
why do i have a horse ? you know how many
people are killed on a horse every year ?
you &apos;re not listening to what i &apos;m saying .
what i &apos;m saying is ,
i &apos;m not gonna take reginald out on the damn lake
when you &apos;re out on your space truck ...
we &apos;re not living by the lake .
why would i spend my hard @-@ earned
truck driver money on an earth house ?
you make up so much science fiction ...
science ...
... but you know nothing about science .
do you know what science is ?
okay , science is more of a belief than anything else .
no . do you know what science is ?
yes . what you believe in .
have you ever taken a science class ?
i &apos;ve taught two at a community college .
when did you teach science at a community college ?
i made that up . i didn &apos;t think you were gonna fact @-@ check me .
my kids are not gonna
beg for an education , okay ?
they &apos;re gonna be forced to go to school
just like everybody else
and they &apos;re gonna hate it !
can i actually be very real with you for a second ?
yes .
here &apos;s what i really believe :
you can create
a plan for your life ,
and then crazy things get thrown at you ,
and that , by the way , is the closest thing
that i have to a plan .
so maybe it &apos;s crazy to talk about being
an intergalactic truck driver .
but what i think is crazier
is trying to plan
every single detail of our future .
i think it &apos;s crazy not to . i just can &apos;t live that way .
i guess we just disagree .
well , we never agree on anything , ever , nick .
why are we doing this right now ,
jess ? we &apos;re hungover .
just because
i want to know we &apos;re going in the same direction ,
that we &apos;re on the same page .
yes , we are .
well , we live on different planets !
you &apos;re talking about the fake future !
i just ...
i guess we want different things .
clearly , we do .
clearly , we do .
all right , so what are you saying ?
should we just break up ?
yeah , right . like we &apos;re just gonna break up .
just break up !
over what ?
you don &apos;t like lakes ,
i don &apos;t like space . that &apos;s okay !
this is not why people break up !
i break up with thee , sir !
i break up ...
i don &apos;t do voices .
i think i &apos;m still drunk .
let &apos;s just get to the party .
build this toy and go .
yeah .
let &apos;s do it .
we are an unstoppable toy @-@ building team !
yes , we are .
all right , well , first hurdle :
the instructions are written upside @-@ down .
ah , it &apos;s a false alarm .
okay , hit me . what do you got ?
okay , take the thing
that looks like a meth lab .
this thing ?
and put it in the thing
that looks like a pipe bomb .
now we &apos;re cooking with gas .
we &apos;re a good team .
i agree .
you know what , jess ... and if you want to move
to portland in the future ,
then we &apos;re gonna move to portland .
you know , we &apos;ll live by the lake .
i &apos;ll learn to fish ,
and me and reginald will start
a newsletter , you know ...
&quot; lake father , lake son . &quot;
and you know what ?
if you want to be a long @-@ haul trucker ,
i can deal with that for six months , tops .
yes !
um , this piece is a little sticky ,
but i think i can just jam it .
what did you just do , jess ?
oh . well , i put the swastika in the guillotine .
how is this a children &apos;s toy ?
why is it so brittle ?
what is that ?
i &apos;m not sure what i &apos;ve been doing .
hey , michelle .
hey . you guys are lifesavers .
you have beautiful taste , by the way .
really . is this early californian ?
you know , this color , actually ,
it symbolizes a woman &apos;s fertility .
i was pregnant once .
cool .
what- what do you know ?
thank you , guys .
no , thank you .
so much .
all right . talk to you la ... you see her blink at me ?
wait , you think that was a sex blink ?
that wasn &apos;t a sex blink .
that was definitely a sex blink , dude .
you would not know a sex blink if it blinked you in the sex .
what ?
it &apos;s over already , man .
you don &apos;t have a shot .
&apos;cause the chicks you pull are gremlins .
you did not just talk about my chicks .
my chicks look great .
just like me .
i &apos;m saying my chicks
literally look just like me . all of &apos; em .
in varying color ,
but they look like me .
that is super awkward ,
and i don &apos;t feel like you know what
you &apos;re saying right now .
coach !
oh , man , i can &apos;t believe
you just did that to her vase .
whoa ! dude !
i will knock you out where you stand ,
and you ... in the ground .
i will pound you from the side !
i will pound you from the back ! that sounded weird .
once again , schmidt has found himself
in a position where he is infuriated !
i will fight your face !
i will freak out so hard
on you right now , you don &apos;t even know , on your face .
what are you two ...
oh , my goodness . guys !
her study @-@ abroad mirror ?
her dream vase ?
come on , guys .
have some self @-@ respect .
we &apos;re ...
hey , jess ?
i don &apos;t think that belongs there .
that &apos;s why it doesn &apos;t fit in .
well , i don &apos;t think this water bottle goes here , either .
but you put it there .
well , why did we take the toy out of the box ?
we could have just given the box to the kid .
what does he know ? he &apos;s one . he eats pennies .
and he poos in his pants .
because not putting the toy together is lazy .
so , if we can &apos;t put the toy together ...
i @-@ i know , but it &apos;s not gonna fit .
you can &apos;t just keep pushing it because it ...
oh , god .
okay , where &apos;s the tape ?
oh , we used all the tape .
oh , you used all the tape .
yeah , to fix the things that you broke .
you used a lot of duct tape .
actually you broke a lot of pieces .
all right , give it to me . i &apos;m gonna use a lighter .
and i &apos;m gonna melt the plastic . i &apos;m gonna weld it together .
what ? you don &apos;t think that &apos;s a good idea ?
no , you should , i think you should try it .
i also like doing zippo tricks .
what happened ? !
i burned my finger !
are you okay ?
yeah , it &apos;s fine . my skin &apos;s a little bubbly .
well , i knew that was a bad idea .
then why didn &apos;t you say anything ?
why didn &apos;t you put the toy together
when i gave it to you two weeks ago ?
because i &apos;m not santa claus !
i don &apos;t just put toys together
two weeks in advance !
and also , it &apos;s none of my business what they want to do with the toy .
maybe they want to return it .
maybe they want to put it together as a family .
that is not my business .
what do you want from me , jess ?
i just want you to take a little more responsibility .
just a little bit more .
and i want you to have a little faith in me !
i &apos;ve gotten this far in my life .
and i &apos;m doing just fine .
i mean , for the most part .
there &apos;s definitely a few blunders here and there
that we could look past .
whatever ...
the blanket &apos;s on fire !
i can see that , jess . go get a bucket .
where is it ? in the kitchen ?
no , that &apos;s for meat .
we need a different bucket .
oh , right !
the famous meat bucket !
you said the meat bucket was a brilliant idea !
why would i think an unrefrigerated
bucket of meat was a good idea ? !
to taste what meat tasted like before electricity !
why would you want that ? !
why did you say it was brilliant ! ?
because , nick ...
if i was always honest with you ...
... then we would never stop fighting .
let &apos;s go !
we have to go !
wait , my hat !
what ?
my hat .
so sorry . i &apos;m sorry .
so sorry . sorry .
it was uncool .
i &apos;m so sorry ! do you need ... ?
here , do you want ... ?
how did this happen ?
it was winston &apos;s fault .
he just ca ...
he carries things wrong .
what ? !
i have heard just about enough from you two .
what ? ow !
winston !
girls , i know you &apos;re both smart enough
to know exactly who broke your things .
it &apos;s the same two clowns
who &apos;ve been trying to sex michelle
every which way from tuesday .
i mean , i ain &apos;t gonna lie .
i &apos;ve been trying to sex you every which way from tuesday myself .
i &apos;d be crazy not to , michelle .
you &apos;re a very beautiful woman .
you have crazy witch eyes , and i dig it .
you &apos;re like a witch ! you know .
but i &apos;m a good guy .
now , if you &apos;ll excuse me ,
i have a job to do .
my name is winston bishop .
welcome to the building .
whoa , winston , i would not ... that &apos;s a ...
winston ,
what are you doing ?
that &apos;s a big ...
oh ! whoa ! son of a ...
winston , you do know that the building &apos;s on fire , right ?
i got this ! move , move !
cece , hey .
i didn &apos;t think you would pick up the phone .
i &apos;ll @-@ i &apos;ll make this quick .
&apos;cause i &apos;m sure you hate talking on the phone .
oh , i actually do .
&apos;cause i &apos;d much rather ,
um , talk in person .
you know ? face to face ?
what are you doing here ?
i just , i was , uh , walking over here to see you .
and then you called me .
didn &apos;t all those texts really freak you out ?
oh , no , no , no , no . they freaked me out .
i thought you were gonna murder me .
you know , i called my mother , changed my locks .
then i kind of , you know , had a change of heart ,
and i thought , &quot; well , you know , i like this girl . &quot;
i &apos;d much rather just come
and look at you with my eyes .
and talk to you with my face .
if you ever got off the damn phone .
yeah .
right ?
i , mm @-@ hmm . i understand .
hi , cece . how are you ?
hungover ?
yes .
would you like to come and get some pancakes ?
yeah , i could , i could use some pancakes .
it &apos;s gonna be a bouncy ride .
my kangaroo &apos;s around the corner .
but i did bring an extra helmet . you &apos;re lucky .
all right .
nick , why is this so hard ?
i don &apos;t want to fight all the time .
i don &apos;t know , and it &apos;s awful .
do you ever miss
when we were just friends , jess ?
and there wasn &apos;t this pressure
to be together and to be ...
be different people ?
yes .
be different people .
i &apos;m sorry , but i &apos;m not that guy who &apos;s gonna
put the toy together . that &apos;s just not me .
i &apos;m the kind of guy who &apos;s gonna leave it in the box .
i don &apos;t want you to be that guy .
i @-@ i want you to be yourself .
i want you to be yourself .
are we ... ?
no ! i love you !
well , i love you , too .
more than i &apos;ve ever loved anybody .
but what if that &apos;s the only thing we have in common ?
i miss my friend .
i really miss my friend , too .
so , what does that mean ?
are we ... ?
yeah .
earn this .
was that saving private ryan ?
it was . it was a hu @-@ huge moment in that movie .
and i just , i know this is a moment .
so , um , i &apos;ll walk you to your room then , i guess .
schmidt is living in my room .
schmidt &apos;s in your room , yeah .
yeah .
do you think i could ... ?
yeah , oh , yeah , yeah , yeah .
it &apos;s cool .
jess ?
jess , you didn &apos;t have to run away .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re so afraid of .
it &apos;s just a man doing full downward facing dog in the nude .
it &apos;s a couple of testicles just hanging upside down .
i can hear you laughing in there .
yeah , you liked it .
you telling nick about it ? what &apos;s he saying ?
