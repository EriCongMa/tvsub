mystic falls ... i was born here .
this is my home .
and mine .
and mine .
for centuries , supernatural creatures have lived among us .
they were vampires , werewolves , doppelgangers ...
witches .
and even hybrids .
then there &apos;s elena . she &apos;s one of us now .
you &apos;re a vampire now ...
you just have to learn the right way to be one .
and i &apos;m gonna teach you .
now there &apos;s a hunter in town , determined to kill us all .
there &apos;s more to you than meets the eye , isn &apos;t there ?
and only i know his secret .
you &apos;re one of the five .
so what is all this ?
some personal items that i snaked
from the vampire hunter &apos;s rv .
may he rest in peace .
i &apos;m searching for a supernatural handbook .
you know for a fact he was supernatural ?
definitely wasn &apos;t natural .
the guy magically appears just as someone
blows up the entire founders &apos; council ,
covered in a tattoo that only jeremy gilbert ,
of all people in the world ,
seems to be able to see .
klaus mentioned something about him being one of the five .
and then he kamikazes himself with explosives .
seem natural to you ?
what &apos;s the five ?
that &apos;s what i &apos;m hoping is in the first chapter of the handbook .
liz forbes , my favorite sheriff .
what ?
that &apos;s ... concerning .
keep me posted .
what , you &apos;re not going to tell me ?
i can &apos;t tell you . it &apos;s private . we &apos;re in a fight .
you &apos;re in a fight , i &apos;m not in a fight .
i &apos;m over it . i &apos;ve been over it .
you &apos;re not still mad at me about elena ?
you let her feed on you . i &apos;m always going to be mad at you .
but we &apos;re not in a fight .
very well , then .
they didn &apos;t find any remains at the explosion site .
so connor &apos;s still out there .
apparently so .
i &apos;m going to need you to get on this today .
i have to take elena to college .
i &apos;m sorry , you have to do what , exactly ?
i &apos;m teaching her how to feed .
she needs to learn snatch , eat ,
erase now more than ever .
we &apos;re not in a fight , remember ?
i know it &apos;s crazy ,
but i almost killed matt last night .
damon had to rip me off of him
and then compel him to forget .
call it doppelganger curse or whatever ,
but i can &apos;t drink animal blood .
i can &apos;t drink from a blood bag .
i can only drink from the vein .
a little slow . almost got you .
that &apos;s why we &apos;re not using the wood ones
for hunter defense class .
what about caroline ?
she &apos;s a genius at self control .
she &apos;s too good .
she doesn &apos;t understand how hard it is .
and you , well , i know what being around
too much blood does to you , so ...
i can &apos;t put you through that .
so i guess that leaves damon , huh ?
don &apos;t be jealous . you know i wish it could be you .
fine . you wish it could be me .
we &apos;re crashing bonnie &apos;s trip to whitmore college .
the professor that took over her gram &apos;s classes ?
he invited her .
listen to me .
you &apos;re the one who &apos;s getting me through this .
no matter who teaches me how to feed .
ok .
just be careful , ok ?
the blood , the feed ...
it &apos;s easy to get caught up in it .
i will .
i promise .
what &apos;s that ?
the key to your new truck .
it &apos;s parked outside , paid for , insured ,
everything but a big red bow .
if that &apos;s your idea of an apology ...
you should probably give it to elena .
she &apos;s the one you killed .
you &apos;re trying too hard .
last i heard , you were leaving town--forever .
well , i was .
but then i thought to myself , how can i when my sister ,
clearly so desperate for love and affection ,
is left here ...
bribing the help .
what do you want , nik ?
i thought i was dead to you .
things change , rebekah .
i &apos;ve stumbled upon something i think might be of interest to you .
doubt that .
no ? well , what if i told you
the brotherhood of the five still existed ?
what ?
you see ?
and like that , bygones .
come on , love . work to do .
we don &apos;t have anything to do .
there is no &quot; we . &quot;
i don &apos;t care about the five ,
and i don &apos;t care about you .
as you wish .
you &apos;re ok with this ?
if i could spell you out of wanting blood , i would .
but i can &apos;t , so better you doing this now
than at freshman orientation .
something tells me that college isn &apos;t in my future anymore .
oh , stop with the pity party .
if i can go to college , you can go to college .
you ? went to college ?
sure . plenty of times .
i always had a thing for sorority girls .
you &apos;re disgusting .
i know .
when i say the word &quot; witch , &quot;
what pops into your head ?
halloween costume ?
villain of a fairy tale ?
maybe an ex @-@ girlfriend ? well , whatever image it is ,
it &apos;s probably not tanielle soso ...
is that him ?
yeah .
he &apos;s kind of ...
hot .
i &apos;m an admittedly crappy photographer .
now , in reality ,
or in this reality , at least ,
witches have appeared across every culture in history .
they &apos;re the architects of the supernatural .
responsible for everything that goes bump in the night ,
from ghosts to vampires
to doppelgangers ...
what is this guy , witchipedia ?
shh , shut up .
now , if you &apos;re a skeptic , you &apos;d call that a coincidence .
but if you &apos;re a true believer ...
you know what , there really isn &apos;t such thing .
what if i &apos;m ... a ripper ?
you &apos;re not a ripper .
what if i am ?
well , then , pick someone and we &apos;ll find out .
stoner guys are no good to grab . they &apos;re too paranoid
and you don &apos;t want the extra buzz .
now , she is fun @-@ sized .
but too alert . geeky girls are inherently suspicious
of anyone who &apos;s nice to them .
what you want is the little blonde , pretty girl .
self absorbed , easily flattered .
you just have to separate her from the pack
and make your move .
am i interrupting you guys ?
or is it maybe the other way around ?
sorry .
i was just saying how much i love witches .
yeah , you and me both , brother .
all right , listen , we should probably talk about
the readings that none of you did .
looks like i &apos;ll have to beef up the hybrid security detail .
i was going to take him ,
but i figured you went through
such trouble to truss him up
in your red room of pain .
it &apos;s from the inquisition .
i thought it was a nice touch .
what &apos;d you get out of him ?
not enough .
he &apos;s mum about the council fire
and he &apos;s not saying anything about this greater evil
we &apos;re all supposed to be shivering over .
what brings you snooping ?
well , i can &apos;t say it in front of him .
as i &apos;m sure you &apos;ve figured out ,
our friend here can &apos;t be compelled .
you &apos;re full of mysteries , aren &apos;t you ?
i told you , i don &apos;t know anything .
thankfully , i know plenty .
shall we ?
so what &apos;s with the home invasion ?
damon said you knew something about this guy .
i should have figured you were up to something
when you healed elena from the werewolf poison
without asking for anything in return .
i was feeling benevolent .
you &apos;re never benevolent .
who is this guy ? what &apos;s the five ?
so many questions .
it &apos;s a good thing i have nothing to do today .
except get answers out of you .
fine .
you might actually be useful
in persuading my sister to cooperate .
the brotherhood of the five
was a group of highly skilled vampire hunters .
we crossed paths with them in the twelfth century .
italy . my siblings and i had followed
the normans as they conquered the south .
feeding , turning people as we went .
these demons live among you .
passing as human .
but with the bloodshed came exposure .
so witness with your own eyes ...
he &apos;s putting on quite the show .
he &apos;s nothing .
i could eat him for sport .
still , you should heed the warning .
between you here and kol in the east ,
you have not been discreet .
stories of the original vampires are spreading .
i welcome such infamy .
if you &apos;re worried about discretion ,
perhaps you should wrangle our sister .
so these hunters
have been around for 900 years ?
apparently .
well , our friend in the other room
is the first i &apos;ve seen since then .
kind of makes you wonder
what they &apos;ve been up to all these years .
and rebekah had a thing with one of them ?
she didn &apos;t just have a thing .
she fell in love with him .
he told her all his secrets .
which i will gladly share with you ...
provided you do one thing for me .
and what &apos;s that ?
get rebekah over here .
she &apos;s being stubborn .
and hateful . i need to make peace with her .
i want her to give me some very important information
about the hunter , which she won &apos;t do
unless she believes we &apos;ve made up .
and ...
what &apos;s in it for me ?
just get her here and i &apos;ll tell you .
and stefan ...
trust me when i say this--
that hunter in there
holds the answer to all your prayers .
april .
can i get you some more water ?
i &apos;m good .
i &apos;m not just sitting here alone
like the loser new girl . i &apos;m with my friend . she just ...
sorry . family drama .
you two are friends ?
is it so hard to believe i would have one ?
yeah . it is .
and i &apos;m keeping the truck .
off limits ! i have dibs .
you won &apos;t remember any of this .
klaus wants me to fake peace with you
so you &apos;ll talk about the five .
yeah , i bet . don &apos;t help him .
he &apos;ll just betray you . it &apos;s what he does .
all right , forget him . help me instead .
why ? you hate me more than he does .
because i &apos;m going to figure out what he &apos;s up to .
and plus i can give you the one thing that he won &apos;t .
and what &apos;s that ?
a clean slate .
i &apos;m not saying that i &apos;m willing to forgive you
for what you did to elena ,
but i &apos;m willing to set it aside and start over .
why would you do that ?
because you &apos;re obviously
not leaving town any time soon ,
and i &apos;m just looking for a way we can all get along .
plus , you can &apos;t be too happy wandering around school
with no friends .
what if i don &apos;t care what you or anyone else thinks ?
i &apos;m pretty sure that you care what ,
matt over there thinks .
so maybe i can talk to him
about a clean slate , too .
she &apos;s young and healthy , she &apos;ll heal up like a charm .
just keep your eye on the ball .
it &apos;s not a game , damon .
fine , it &apos;s not a game ,
it &apos;s a high @-@ stakes dangerous maneuver .
now , just go . just like we practiced .
that &apos;s all you have to do .
hey ! you &apos;re in my anthro class , right ?
uh , yeah . i guess so .
i , uh , totally spaced
and forgot to get the reading list . do you have it ?
sure . let me check .
this isn &apos;t going to hurt . please don &apos;t scream .
who &apos;s that ?
it &apos;s my little sister .
get out of here . go back to class .
what the hell are you doing ?
i just ... i saw the picture , and i--
everybody is someone &apos;s uncle or father
or camp counselor or bible study teacher .
elena , you don &apos;t know these people . why do you care ?
i care because i &apos;m still me !
i still have the same feelings , damon .
sorry if that spoils your master plan
to turn me into a super vampire .
what &apos;s going on ?
nothing . elena &apos;s educating me
on the importance of feelings .
did you talk to the professor ?
for a second . he found some stuff of my grams
in his office and he &apos;s going to dig it up for me .
oh , uh , this .
oh , nice .
the answer to all of our problems .
a frat party , douche central .
which is why you &apos;ll be eating very well tonight .
so what should we go as ?
victims or killers ?
you feeling all right , mate ?
are the shackles too tight ?
welcome home , sister .
this is a trick ?
how do you know he &apos;s one of the five ?
where &apos;s his bloody tattoo ?
oh , the tattoos aren &apos;t visible
on this lot like they were on the last .
let &apos;s eat .
thank you , my lovely .
i could kiss the council
for burning up all the vervain in town .
they made my life so much easier .
rebekah , love , eat your veggies .
i &apos;m not eating till you apologize .
for which indiscretion ? there have been so many .
you broke my neck .
you threw away elena &apos;s blood
so i can &apos;t make any more hybrids .
&apos;cause you took me for granted ! -
that &apos;s what big brothers do , sweetheart !
let me just name the million other people
i &apos;d rather be having dinner with right now .
all right , fine .
i &apos;m sorry .
i often forget how delicate you are .
forgive me ?
i &apos;ll take it under consideration .
ok , good . ahem .
now , why don &apos;t you tell me about rebekah &apos;s hunter ?
right . alexander .
nice chap , forgoing the obvious issues .
he was looking for creatures of the night ,
which is why we felt quite safe around him
wearing our daylight rings .
i &apos;m unaccustomed to such luxury .
well , it &apos;s the least we could do
to repay you for opening our eyes to the truth .
we &apos;re curious to hear more about your order .
your crusade .
we are but five men .
bound by fire and the last breath
of a dying witch to a single cause .
the destruction of all vampires .
and how do you hope to achieve this ?
we have the ultimate weapon ,
which no vampire can survive .
so , that &apos;s what this is about ?
a weapon ?
not just any weapon .
rebekah , love , don &apos;t get ahead of the story .
how is a weapon the answer to all of my prayers ?
ok .
why don &apos;t we just skip with the theatrics
and get right to the point ?
not quite yet .
because in order to find this weapon ,
we need to solve the puzzle ,
which seems to have disappeared .
what puzzle ?
the tattoo .
what is it ?
a map .
leading us to its treasure .
fat lot of good a tattoo &apos;s going to do if we can &apos;t see it .
we can &apos;t , but someone else can .
why don &apos;t you tell the hybrid to bring him in , love ?
you see , the hunter was so eager to get
to the bottom of his mystery tattoos
that he mentioned there was only one other person
who could see them .
i wouldn &apos;t . lucky for us ,
young jeremy here is a bit of an artist .
i &apos;m not helping you with anything .
i &apos;m afraid you are .
i &apos;m frankie .
unassuming serial killer .
i &apos;m jack .
and these are the two lovely ladies
i just ... rippered .
welcome to the murder house .
bloody mary &apos;s free until midnight .
enjoy yourselves .
well , hats off to these idiots .
oh , look , there &apos;s professor creepy .
his name is professor shane , and he &apos;s not creepy .
i &apos;m going to go talk to him .
you do that .
inebriated sleazeballs all covered in blood .
come on , pick one .
i think i found one .
roofie guy ?
nice choice . go get &apos; em .
i &apos;m sorry .
drink ?
sure .
i &apos;ll be right back .
great party , right ?
you &apos;re not going to make a sound .
now remember , the idea is not to kill him .
elena .
elena , step away from the ledge .
elena !
leave and forget about this .
nice touch
how do you feel ?
i feel good !
i want more .
you set me up at the hospital .
led me to a trap .
why ?
you were trying to hurt people who are important to me .
important to you ?
that vampire just threatened to kill you .
i don &apos;t understand how you
could see the tattoo if you &apos;re a sympathizer .
what exactly do you understand ?
&apos;cause a couple days ago , you seemed to have all the answers .
and now you know jack .
where did this tattoo come from ?
why am i the only one who can see it ?
years ago , i met someone with a mark .
claimed he had this intense desire to kill vampires .
like it was ingrained in his dna .
told me the same thing i told you--
if i could see the mark , i was a potential .
who was he ?
just a guy i served in iraq with .
i lost track of him , and then one day ...
the tattoo just showed up on me .
it started on my hand , but the more vampires i killed ,
the more it spread , like ...
like it was trying to tell me something .
i just--i just don &apos;t know what .
so tell me more about this tattoo .
my sister &apos;s suitor was unwilling to tell us anything .
rebekah , however , was more than willing to ...
investigate , isn &apos;t that right ?
how do you read these symbols ?
the map took my brothers and i years to translate .
the sword ...
is the key to reading it .
have you considered my offer ?
to come with me when i leave to follow the map ?
i have .
and i would like that very much .
what is that ?
oh , that ?
that ...
is a very special weapon .
for a very special kind of vampire .
when my brotherhood has achieved its destiny ,
those monsters will cease to exist .
until then ,
we have the daggers .
do you really believe they &apos;re all so evil
they must be put down ?
let us not talk of such evil .
let us do this .
mmm . and this .
and this .
and this .
my sister &apos;s boyfriend
threw a slumber party that night .
he and his brothers put us all down in our sleep .
elijah , kol , finn ... and me .
how was i supposed to know ?
cheers . to my sister &apos;s uncanny ability to choose men .
i thought the daggers didn &apos;t work on you
because of your werewolf side .
they don &apos;t .
what happened ?
ask him .
only , he cannot answer
because i have ripped out his tongue ,
along with the rest of them .
nik , i had no idea !
but you should have .
your only family was nearly wiped out
because of your stupidity !
what did he promise you ?
nothing .
nothing .
he would not have made a move
unless he knew you were vulnerable .
you trusted him ...
over me !
what did he promise you ?
nothing , nik , i swear !
what did he promise you ? !
tell me , rebekah !
go ahead , rebekah , tell him .
tell him what the hunter told you
the tattoo leads to .
what &apos;s this great weapon that could bring upon the end
of the vampire species ?
a cure .
he said there was a cure .
there is no cure for vampirism .
i &apos;m telling the truth , stefan .
then why wouldn &apos;t you have searched for it , found it ?
because when the hunters drew their final breath that night ,
the marks disappeared from their body .
the map was gone , the brotherhood of the five extinct .
for 900 years , there was not a whisper of another hunter
until our friend in there showed up in town .
well , now we have the map , what do we do next ?
we don &apos;t do anything .
you can &apos;t be trusted , little sister .
you &apos;ll be blabbing this secret to the first boy who calls you pretty .
i mean , it &apos;s pathetic , really , isn &apos;t it ?
how she continues to hand her heart
to any man who shows her a hint of affection .
you think she would have learned by now
from the endless cycle of disappointment and deception !
but i haven &apos;t ! instead i stay with you
and let you leech every moment
of happiness from my life .
you know , at least i faired better than finn .
klaus left him daggered because he was tired of his judgment .
no , finn was a dullard .
he &apos;s more interesting lying in a box .
you want the cure for elena , don &apos;t you ?
so you can go back to mass producing your hybrids .
that &apos;s why you brought stefan in ,
cause you knew he &apos;d help you even though he hates your guts .
you know what , you can shove your cure .
well , i hope you got what you wanted out of her
before you chased her off .
she never would have told me what i needed to know .
but she &apos;ll tell you .
what do you need me to find out ?
the map is useless without the tool to decipher it .
the sword .
she knows where it is . and you &apos;re going to get her to tell you .
you have a chance to save elena
from the very thing that &apos;s going to destroy her .
you can call it a deal with the devil
if you like .
but you know you won &apos;t walk away from it .
i put your grandmother &apos;s stuff around here somewhere .
there were a couple family photos
and a first edition stephen king .
did you know she liked &quot; cujo &quot; ?
this is amazing . it &apos;s all stuff you picked up on your travels ?
yeah . i , uh , i do this thing .
it &apos;s like a one man traveling occult exhibit to small towns .
it funds my crazy indiana jones adventures .
do you practice ? like she did ?
i &apos;m a true believer . just don &apos;t tell anyone .
no , i don &apos;t practice . not anymore .
i lost control of myself and there were consequences .
witches love their consequences , don &apos;t they ?
you know , there are other ways to practice magic . if you &apos;re interested .
are you ...
no . no , no , no .
i &apos;m just , uh , i &apos;m just a guy with a very open mind
who has seen a lot of things .
and i &apos;m willing to test some of them out .
if you are .
don &apos;t scream . this isn &apos;t going to hurt .
oh , my god . oh , my god .
let &apos;s get out of here .
nice lines .
now , if you could just hurry it up a little bit .
i &apos;m done .
what is this ?
it &apos;s the tattoo .
i &apos;ve seen the tattoo , you repugnant punk .
there &apos;s more to it .
that &apos;s all of it .
he said every time he kills a vampire , it spreads .
nate !
tell the girl to take jeremy home .
keep this one alive at all costs .
looks like you got too much leash .
you &apos;re not going anywhere , so you might as well .
stop the racket .
you &apos;re lucky i can &apos;t kill you .
freak .
who am i ? why am i acting like this ?
because you listened to damon
and damon makes everything he wants
sound like a good idea .
i should be here with stefan .
i shouldn &apos;t be here with him .
i should be going through all this with stefan .
i &apos;m guessing we should hit the road .
you were supposed to help her ,
and you let her get completely out of control .
she &apos;s not out of control , she was having fun .
this isn &apos;t fun . she &apos;s acting like a different person !
she is a different person ! she &apos;s a vampire .
we &apos;re a predatory species . we enjoy the hunt ,
the feed , and the kill . and when the guilt gets too bad ,
we switch off our humanity and we revel in it .
is that what you want ? her to be like you ?
she already is like me .
and you know what makes me able to drink my fill
and leave someone breathing and not rip their head off
like my brother , is that i can revel in it .
i can make it fun .
i got your message .
i &apos;m sorry . i know you wanted my help .
he just ... makes me so angry .
no one deserves to be treated that way .
i wanted it back then .
the cure .
i was willing to leave behind my family for it .
would you take it if you had the chance ?
or is it just for elena ?
part of me wishes that she and i can have
an eternity together .
but damon &apos;s right .
there &apos;s not a single vampire
who hasn &apos;t killed a human .
elena will kill .
and then there will be the pain ,
and the guilt , and then ...
the humanity switch .
elena , she &apos;s driven by love .
by compassion .
when she turns off her humanity ,
then i don &apos;t think we &apos;ll ever get her back .
so i &apos;d do anything to save her .
i envy that .
you and elena .
i envy the love you have .
i really did believe alex
when he said he loved me .
he promised we &apos;d be married .
we even picked out a church .
san vittore in brienno .
i know you want my help , stefan .
but i just can &apos;t do anything
that lets my brother get what he wants .
i never did answer your question .
if it meant that i got to be with her ...
have children ,
grow old with her ...
if it meant that we &apos;d die together ,
be buried together ...
then , yes .
i &apos;d take the cure .
i buried him .
even after everything .
i laid him to rest in the place where we would be married .
what kind of hopeless fool does that ?
but that &apos;s what you wanted to know , isn &apos;t it ?
because i buried him with his sword .
i &apos;m sorry , little sister , but you &apos;re right .
you really are a hopeless fool .
i &apos;m sorry , rebekah .
go right ahead .
laugh at the girl who loved too easily .
but i would rather have lived my life than yours , nik .
no one will ever sit around the table telling stories
about a man who couldn &apos;t love .
do it .
look me in the eye
and do it , you coward !
do it !
i have a plane waiting .
i &apos;ll get the sword .
my hybrids will keep an eye on connor .
you put rebekah somewhere no one will find her .
and make sure jeremy forgets everything he heard today .
i &apos;ll take care of it .
no one must know about the cure , do you understand ?
not damon , not elena .
nobody .
if this gets out , it could mean all our deaths .
so if you tell anyone ,
i &apos;ll erase each and every memory from all of you .
i won &apos;t say anything .
it &apos;s just you and me in this , stefan .
some secrets are stronger than family .
well then .
good night .
damon ...
i &apos;m sorry .
things got a little heated at the party ,
and ...
i shouldn &apos;t have let that happen .
it &apos;s just that i-- i feel like--
what do you feel , elena ?
when you tell me what a vampire should be ,
deep down , i believe you .
i think that you &apos;re right , and i--i hate that feeling .
because i don &apos;t want to be ...
you don &apos;t want to be like me .
hey .
hey .
what are you doing here ?
just hanging out with jeremy .
we had a couple things to talk about .
any news on the hunter ?
no . no , nothing new .
well , then today was a bust .
she &apos;s all yours .
so , uh ...
what happened ?
i learned how to feed
without hurting someone .
it was awful .
you were right , i ... got caught up in it .
ah , it &apos;ll get easier .
but i don &apos;t want it to get easier .
i can &apos;t live like this .
stefan , i &apos;m ...
feeling things that i don &apos;t--
i don &apos;t want to feel , and i &apos;m becoming someone
that i don &apos;t want to be .
i don &apos;t think i &apos;m going to survive this .
hey . yes , you will . i promise .
no .
you just have to hold on .
yeah , i got it . i &apos;ll keep him fat and happy .
you should send two more for protection .
make that three .
shouldn &apos;t you be in mystic falls killing vampires ?
