i had this badass professor in med school .
she seemed invincible .
then one day , she needed her gallbladder out .
and the surgery killed her .
her platelets stopped clotting .
she bled out on the table .
everything that could &apos;ve gone wrong ...
did go wrong .
surgeons have a name for it .
we call it a perfect storm .
funny .
never thought it would happen to me .
ethan , so they &apos;re moving you and your dad
to a safer hospital for now , okay , buddy ?
can &apos;t you come , too ?
they need me here . okay ?
hang out a minute . we &apos;ll send the gurney back down .
it won &apos;t be so loud once you &apos;re inside ,
and then it &apos;s just-- it &apos;s just fun , okay ?
i don &apos;t know how you can even pretend this isn &apos;t an issue .
because it &apos;s not .
were you even gonna tell me you wanted to adopt him ?
well , that didn &apos;t happen , so--
but you wanted to .
owen ...
you want kids .
this is about one kid , this kid who needed--
okay , but the fact that you are lying to yourself
doesn &apos;t make me feel better about you lying to me .
i am not lying about the fact that i love you
and i want my life to be with you .
you don &apos;t think you &apos;re gonna look at me one day
and only see the things i couldn &apos;t give you ?
god , has it ever occurred to you
i might know my own mind better than you ?
oh , my god .
figures you &apos;d go into labor in the middle of a super storm .
okay , we need to go over your birth plan .
we never talked details .
hang on .
i can &apos;t bully people unless i know what to bully them about .
maybe you should get back into bed .
you want to go back to bed ?
no !
she says no .
what do you need-- a pillow , a bouncy ball ?
ice chips .
she says ice chips .
are you gonna do this the whole time ?
okay , i &apos;m gonna check on connie ,
see what &apos;s taking her so long .
oh , she &apos;s with other laboring moms right now .
she &apos;s busy .
you &apos;re the only one i care about . the rest can wait .
did you talk to owen ?
yes and no .
god , how is your pain now-- 7 , 8 ?
9 .
talk to me about owen . it helps .
uh , well , owen is ...
at a 10 .
this guy was cleaning his gutters in hurricane @-@ force winds .
it &apos;s like he wanted to spend the night on an o.r. table .
not that i &apos;m complaining .
you &apos;re awfully excited about another man &apos;s misfortunes .
no , i just meant
i &apos;m glad dr. bailey &apos;s getting back into an o.r.
yeah , so am i.
i can &apos;t do this .
miranda ...
go back inside .
all right , what is our risk of flooding here ?
oh , you got water pumps . you got sandbags .
the lights keep flickering .
now are the generators--
i tested &apos; em last month .
listen , you guys got patients to worry about .
you take care of them .
this--this hospital &apos;s my patient .
these beds are filling up fast .
yeah , people think this is the safest place
to sit out a storm .
half these people aren &apos;t even sick .
they &apos;re just scared .
yeah .
not used to it yet ?
it just feels really weird on my finger .
i keep running it into stuff .
pin it your scrub top .
oh , cool .
chief . hey , uh , there &apos;s a patient in o.r. two
who needs an exploratory lap immediately .
the patient &apos;s already under .
do you have any general surgeons available ?
you look available .
i @-@ i &apos;m not , sir .
uh , uh , excuse me .
e @-@ excuse me .
uh , you &apos;re my son &apos;s doctor-- jimmy strickland ?
is he done with surgery already ?
no , sir . uh , we haven &apos;t started yet .
i @-@ is everything okay ?
um , everything is fine , sir .
uh , i &apos;ll be the doctor operating on your son .
will you walk with me , mr. strickland ,
and fill me in on what happened ?
i would like to help out , chief , however i can &apos;t .
well , it makes it hard when you won &apos;t touch a patient .
actually , i was gonna suggest that we get someone
to make sure there &apos;s enough surplus blood in the o.r.s.
cut her some slack .
what happened to you ?
a tree .
karev , if you &apos;re free ,
the nicu needs help getting all these babies out of here .
i thought arizona was overseeing this .
has anyone seen her ?
hey , you okay ?
uh , yeah , no .
the nicu &apos;s just understaffed , and i should be there already .
you need an extra set of hands ?
oh , no . please , just ...
no .
i understand your concerns , tim , but we were just told
to evacuate the highest priorities first .
so crystal &apos;s baby gets taken to safety
and mine is stuck here ?
it &apos;s perfectly safe here , tim . okay ?
the pit says we have to suspend evacuations due to the weather .
wait . we were just down there .
the last rig to leave couldn &apos;t even make it
out of the parking lot .
don &apos;t worry . don &apos;t worry .
all of our staff is very well trained ,
and your babies are in very good hands , okay ?
i only see two nurses .
no one else made it in for their shift ?
oh , okay . all right . this is important .
the makers of tiny humans get easily spooked .
it is our job tonight to keep the tiny human makers happy ,
or they will mutiny , and we are outnumbered .
we remain calm . we remain confident .
because everything is just fine . understood ?
you need some help ?
yes .
no .
i @-@ i thought that i told you--
i &apos;m not gonna sit on my hands
while there &apos;s a roomful of babies that need help .
what can i do ?
you can cross @-@ check the med rec forms
so we can get the correct dosages .
we &apos;re outnumbered .
keep the tiny human makers happy , right ?
well , i didn &apos;t expect to see you again so soon .
her contractions are every three minutes .
and she doesn &apos;t want drugs .
i have dr. knox available
in case she changes her mind .
look , she doesn &apos;t want drugs .
okay , can everybody just please shut up ?
i want to push . i feel like i need to push .
can i push ?
i just need to check first ...
what &apos;s going on ?
meredith , i need you not to push .
why ?
there &apos;s face presentation .
i can feel your baby &apos;s face .
so we &apos;re gonna need to do a c @-@ section .
a c @-@ section ? i do not want to have surgery .
i know .
all right . you know what ? it &apos;s just a &quot; c. &quot;
that &apos;s barely surgery . a moron could do a &quot; c. &quot;
i--no offense .
okay .
well , don &apos;t panic . it &apos;s just a power outage .
there are generators . the power &apos;s gonna go on any second .
yeah , it &apos;s gonna be fine .
derek ?
yeah , any second .
&apos;perfect storm&apos;
okay , stay calm .
let &apos;s get some flashlights ,
all the light that you can find .
somebody get me a headlamp .
right away , doctor .
dr. warren , how &apos;s the gas ?
good . backup battery switched itself on .
his b.p. is still dropping , though .
i can &apos;t see what the problem is .
why isn &apos;t the echo on battery power ?
there should be a manual switch .
ross , go look .
i know the generator should be on .
i &apos;m asking why it &apos;s not .
webber , i &apos;m checking in . do you need anything ?
some light would be good .
the emergency lights shoulda kicked on .
well , they didn &apos;t .
frank , when the generator went out in &apos; 06,
you said there was air in the fuel system .
then you told me that it would never happen again .
yes , sir .
well , then maybe you should get your ass down there
and get lookin &apos; .
i &apos;ve got a man open on the table here .
yes , sir .
hang in there , people . we &apos;re working on it .
that probably helped .
yelling at the guy .
yes ! i got it !
damn it .
pericardial effusion .
page russell .
uh , i don &apos;t believe he made it in , sir ,
because of the storm .
dr. yang &apos;s the senior cardio surgeon in charge .
okay , then get yang .
can &apos;t you just rotate the baby
and--and push his face away ?
it &apos;s very risky , for the baby , for meredith .
uh , dr. yang .
dr. webber needs you in o.r. two .
to do what ? i can &apos;t operate in the dark .
no one is operating in the dark .
okay , just go . i &apos;ll be fine .
okay , happy , come here
and update me as soon as they &apos;ve made a decision .
so what are the risks of repositioning the baby ?
not the minor risks . the big , ugly , scary risks .
because i &apos;m a lightning rod for those .
it &apos;s not an option .
why not ?
are you saying babies with face presentation
can &apos;t be born naturally ?
it &apos;s not a good option .
neither is cutting into my wife in the dark .
how many babys have you delivered in your career ,
dr. shepherd ?
what , a couple , maybe more ?
when i say a vaginal delivery isn &apos;t an option ,
i mean , it &apos;s not an option .
now i could stand here and waste time
explaining how your baby is in a mento @-@ posterior position
and how pushing a baby like that
will hyperextend its neck ,
which can be fatal ,
or i can better spend my time prepping your wife ...
and baby for a delivery
that will not endanger either of their lives .
so ...
which do you prefer ?
we &apos;re having a c @-@ section in the dark .
yes ...
we are .
the vents kicked on to battery power ?
i checked them all twice . they &apos;re working .
all the babies are breathing .
good .
listen , uh ,
we were talking before the whole tree thing happened--
it &apos;s fine . we--you can just forget that i--
um , no sudden moves . wilson , don &apos;t turn around .
uh , karev , can you discreetly
check out that monitor behind me ,
the one for crystal &apos;s baby vent ?
do you see that red light ?
yes .
that &apos;s the low @-@ battery light , right ?
oh , crap .
keep smiling .
mm . okay , uh ,
wilson , will you go check the drawer over there
where we keep the spare batteries ?
tell me what you see .
slowly and casually .
no batteries .
okay .
okay . no one panics .
i am going to look for spare batteries
while you all act like nothing &apos;s wrong .
understand me ? nothing &apos;s wrong .
something &apos;s wrong ?
no .
blood &apos;s here .
oh , uh , thank you , nurse .
oh , uh , i &apos;m--i &apos;m sorry , bailey . i thought you were--
i &apos;m just trying to do what i can to help out .
four units a.b.-neg.
i yelled at her .
i thought it would work ,
that tough love is what she needed
to get her back inside the o.r.
i joined in as an anesthesiologist on this surgery
because i thought that would get her back in this o.r.
my way didn &apos;t work either .
there &apos;s blood in there ,
exiting the heart .
i can &apos;t find out where unless i open him up .
and i &apos;m not opening his chest with no light .
i am not operating on people in the dark .
sir , i cannot operate under these conditions .
didn &apos;t we just teach the syrians
how to operate under these conditions ?
i &apos;m not in syria .
yang , this is james strickland .
he &apos;s got a wife , carol
and four kids back in arizona .
james &apos; dad is 80 and alone
since james &apos; mom died on christmas .
and he &apos;s far too stubborn to move into assisted living ,
which is why james found himself
on his father &apos;s roof trying to clean out his gutter
when the storm hit .
he was just trying to take care of his dad .
he &apos;s a good man .
and he will die on this table if you don &apos;t operate , yang .
while we stand around and watch ,
this man will die .
i &apos;ll scrub in .
you two own the hospital .
can i request that o.r.s be stocked with
more than one flashlight in the future ?
you get this baby out of me safely ,
and you can have whatever you want .
what about william ?
i like sebastian .
sebastian shepherd ? that &apos;s a bit of a mouthful .
brooks ?
i &apos;m not giving birth to a country singer .
no , it &apos;s--i see heather .
brooks .
dude , you &apos;re operating in the dark on your wife ?
yeah .
uh , chief hunt asked me to go to the o.r.s
and let them know that the guy is trying to fix the emergency lights .
we could use a hand with these lights .
okay , here we go .
wait . i &apos;m scared .
there is nothing to be scared of .
we can do this .
everything will be fine .
okay ?
don &apos;t mess this up .
sit down , please , so i can work .
okay , let &apos;s go . ross , light .
a couple of people have asked for two blankets .
one per person . that &apos;s it .
matthew , what are you doing here ?
my rig stalled out in the river that used to be pike street .
i walked the rest of the way here .
how can i help ?
grab some blankets .
okay .
okay , now ordinarily , i &apos;d discharge you ,
but for now , this is home , all right ?
torres , blood &apos;s been distributed .
anything else i can do ?
you hear that noise ?
oh , my god !
it flipped right over .
oh , my god .
oh , man .
what happened ?
i don &apos;t know . i just--
oh , my god . fire !
oh , my god .
the bus caught on fire !
hurry ! hurry !
i smell gas .
there &apos;s a fuel leak somewhere .
we were coming from the church ,
trying to wait out the storm .
careful .
the roof , it caved in on us .
we had nowhere else to go .
we &apos;ve got to get everyone away from this fire .
easy . easy .
all right , if you can walk ,
let &apos;s get you inside ! this way !
we &apos;re gonna need to setup an emergency triage inside .
we &apos;re gonna need meds . bailey , can you handle this ?
y @-@ yeah . uh , murphy !
we gotta move , hunt . this thing &apos;s gonna blow .
avery , hurry up !
i got one more .
she &apos;s jammed between two seats . help me get her out .
this is not how i wanted to do this .
well , you once said that about marrying me .
look how that turned out .
i love you .
and your baby is out .
what do you see ?
i don &apos;t know . it &apos;s too dark .
i don &apos;t hear him crying . why isn &apos;t he crying ?
somebody talk to me .
i don &apos;t hear him crying .
all right .
here you go .
look at that .
he &apos;s perfect .
he &apos;s just perfect .
derek ?
his breathing is shallow . his sats are low .
why are his sats low ?
well , in the dark like this , it &apos;s hard to be sure .
but it &apos;s not uncommon ,
especially in babies like these that come out early .
we &apos;ll get him to the nicu and make sure everything checks out .
derek , go with him .
do not leave his side for a second .
do you hear me ?
okay .
okay , guys , don &apos;t leave her side .
make sure she &apos;s okay . you understand me ?
got it , boss .
yes , sir .
another battery light just went on in there .
any luck ?
no .
no one thought about spare batteries .
and pretty soon , all those machines are gonna die out there ,
and then all those babies are gonna die ,
and all because i didn &apos;t think ahead to stockpile batteries .
and also , i cheated on my wife with that ...
woman out there , and i &apos;m a horrible person .
i &apos;m horrible .
i &apos;m in love with that intern out there ,
but i won &apos;t tell her .
and i keep saying to myself i won &apos;t tell her
because everyone i love turns out to be crazy
or mean or cancer @-@ y or--
or leaves .
but the thing all those women have in common is me .
they were all fine before they met me .
i &apos;m ... damaged goods or something .
so you &apos;re not the worst person in this closet .
there are no batteries in here .
what the hell are we gonna do ?
i have no idea .
okay , we need antibiotics , anti @-@ inflammatories ,
and pain meds-- lots of pain meds .
i &apos;ve never heard screams like that before .
oh , no . it &apos;s dead .
there &apos;s no way for me to ...
punch in my code .
how--how are we supposed to get meds if ...
oh , come on . open .
he looked good , right ? i mean , that-- that cry was loud .
and he--he looked good . you saw him , right ?
uh , i guess so .
i didn &apos;t get a good look .
say good things .
when you don &apos;t have the information
and you &apos;re talking to the mother of a newborn , you say good things .
&apos;cause nine out of ten times , that &apos;s what &apos;s going to happen ,
the good things .
what are you teaching these guys anyway , dr. grey ?
i know , right ?
dr. ryan , it &apos;s an emergency .
i &apos;ve got a mom with a placental abruption .
okay , meredith , i &apos;ve closed your uterus ,
and i just started to suture your incisions .
do you trust these guys to finish ?
have you taught them that much ?
i &apos;ll do it .
no , you stole neuro . you &apos;re not stealing this .
this is my surgery , my patient ,
my incision , mine .
dr. grey , i &apos;m sorry . that was inappropriate .
it &apos;s okay , ross . i like the enthusiasm .
go scrub .
thank you .
thanks , connie .
good luck , mommy . congrats .
more light .
uh , to your left .
i can &apos;t find the source .
everything i look at turns out to be a shadow .
i @-@ i could kill him if i do this .
well , you &apos;ll certainly kill him if you don &apos;t .
will you stop saying that ? it &apos;s not helping . i can &apos;t see .
then don &apos;t look .
everyone , turn out your lights .
uh , what do you mean ?
i &apos;m sorry . what ?
shh . yang .
listen for it .
you know what a healthy heart sounds like .
listen and tell me where the problem is .
now , everyone ,
lights out
and quiet .
it &apos;s ...
wait .
i think it &apos;s ...
it &apos;s here .
i got it .
i got it . i have my finger on the leak .
it &apos;s ventricular .
lights , please .
if the ventilators stop working ,
then these babies die
unless we manually bag them .
crystal &apos;s battery light has been on a while ,
so when it dies ,
you switch her baby over to manual ventilation
calmly and quietly .
you guys , go check on the other babies .
dr. shepherd ?
his sats are low , even with oxygen .
i think he needs c @-@ pap .
this yours ?
yeah .
congrats , man . let &apos;s take a look at him .
thank you .
wilson , go .
excuse me .
hey , crystal .
i &apos;m just gonna switch your little girl
over to a manual vent , okay ?
oh , wow . look at her .
i think she &apos;s grown since yesterday .
found another red light ,
on the hitchens baby in the back .
that makes two more so far .
three . i just found another one , too , but it &apos;s fine .
i &apos;ll just jump in and bag my baby when it &apos;s time .
and dr. edwards can bag hers .
we don &apos;t know how long the power &apos;s gonna be off .
we could be bagging these babies all night .
we &apos;ll bag all night .
it &apos;s fine . we can do this .
thank you .
okay , the important thing is that we keep calm
and we don &apos;t alarm the parents , cause there &apos;s no reason to ...
excuse me , dr. robbins ?
yes , tim . what is it ?
this red thing right here , is this a low @-@ battery light ?
where are hunt and avery ?
that fire &apos;s getting bigger .
where are the pain meds ?
i got a patient in pain over here .
i @-@ i tried to get the meds .
the machine , it-- it won &apos;t open without power .
i can &apos;t get it to open .
all right . never mind that .
i &apos;ve got at least two open fractures
and some nasty lacerations .
you want to jump in over there ?
i ... i don &apos;t , uh ...
uh , you need meds .
i &apos;ll figure out the meds . murphy .
smell that ? there &apos;s gas everywhere .
i have a daughter . she &apos;s 3 .
have--have you seen her ? is she okay ?
all right , i &apos;m gonna have to wrap this arm
to stop the bleeding .
no , no , she &apos;s wearing pink high @-@ tops .
her name is evelyn . i call her evie .
everyone &apos;s inside , ma &apos;am . i &apos;m sure that she &apos;s there .
if we can move this thing even an inch ,
i think we can get her out of here .
let &apos;s do it fast .
need some more light over here .
ross , what is taking so long ?
it &apos;s fine . it &apos;s just--
it won &apos;t stop bleeding .
ooh . oh , god . that &apos;s--
that &apos;s a lot of blood .
how much blood ?
i don &apos;t know . it &apos;s not coming from your uterus .
brooks , shine a light over here . i feel something on my hand .
there &apos;s blood coming out around of my i.v.
i &apos;m in d.i.c.
i need f.f.p. , packed red blood cells , and platelets .
i had a fall .
what ?
yesterday , i @-@ i fell down the stairs .
i might have injured something in my abdomen .
did you feel any pain ?
i &apos;ve been in labor .
go get help , now .
ross , we don &apos;t have time .
you need to open me back up and find the source of this bleed .
i can &apos;t . i &apos;ve never--
shane , it &apos;s a basic midline laparotomy .
pack the four quadrants .
find the source of the bleed .
do not let me bleed out on this table .
dr. grey--
shane , do it , right now .
good . good . it &apos;s moving .
pull her out . pull her out .
all right , go , go .
i got her .
ah . all right , we &apos;re gonna walk you out through the door .
we &apos;re gonna-- you &apos;re gonna have to walk--
no , no , no , no .
my leg , my leg . i can &apos;t .
ma &apos;am ... i &apos;m gonna need you to cover your eyes , all right ?
ready ? here we go .
aah ! stay down .
all right .
this is ridiculous .
so you &apos;re saying you don &apos;t have any extra batteries ?
manual ventilation is just as effective--
my monitor just went black .
i &apos;m on it .
my baby can &apos;t die . is my baby gonna die ?
mine &apos;s out , too .
all right . i &apos;m on my way .
see ? we &apos;re handling it .
everything is under control .
under control ? do the math .
you have doctors on four different babies right now .
you &apos;re the only one left .
you &apos;re telling me you can ventilate a dozen babies
all by yourself ?
okay , okay--
this is not okay !
everybody . everybody , shut up !
you &apos;re right . there are not enough doctors
in this room to ventilate every baby .
but there are enough people .
he &apos;s right . we can teach you .
you want us to bag our own babies ?
actually , it &apos;s pretty easy .
i learned how to do it my first day in med school .
i &apos;ll show you .
you just take the bag with your dominant hand ,
give a good , hard squeeze every second .
so one one thousand .
two one thousand .
three one thousand .
you want to try ?
not really .
no , you &apos;ll be fine . i &apos;ll be right here .
come on .
one one thousand .
two one thousand ...
that &apos;s great . that &apos;s great .
everything &apos;s gonna be just fine .
it looks like the spleen is the source of the bleeding .
okay , so mobilize the spleen ,
divide it by its ligamentous attachments--
i can &apos;t . i &apos;ve never done it .
you can . you &apos;ve seen me do it .
mobilize , assess the injury ,
and stop the hemorrhage .
okay .
okay .
i need metz
and lap pads , please .
and follow me with suction .
that &apos;s right , ross .
that &apos;s it . you got this . this is your o.r.
you don &apos;t need my help .
yes , i do .
no , you don &apos;t ,
because i &apos;m gonna lose consciousness in a few seconds .
and you &apos;re gonna be on your own .
and you &apos;re not gonna freak out .
and , shane , if i arrest for more than nine minutes ,
let me go .
don &apos;t revive me . i do not want to be a vegetable .
do you understand me ?
shane , i need you to respond .
i need to know you understand me .
dr. ross , your ...
superior
is asking you to respond--
yes , dr. grey .
ross , you can--
you can do this .
and t--
tell derek ...
i know
the baby &apos;s name .
it &apos;s ...
you okay ?
that was ...
you made me a better doctor tonight ,
dr. webber .
thank you .
you &apos;re welcome .
i &apos;m gonna go check on meredith ,
see if we have a baby yet .
grey &apos;s having her baby ?
well , what do you know ?
well , i oughta see what &apos;s holding up frank .
i see what she means--
miranda--when she talks about you .
she says that you can , uh ,
pull greatness right out of people .
i wasn &apos;t able to pull it out of her , apparently .
it &apos;s not working . it &apos;s jammed .
&quot; in case of emergency , use the key . &quot;
a bus crashed . this is an emergency .
we are using the damn key . here .
dr. bailey , can you help us ?
it &apos;s dr. grey . she &apos;s in surgery , and she &apos;s in bad shape .
dr. grey is very capable . she &apos;ll figure it out .
she &apos;s not operating . she &apos;s the one on the table .
dr. bailey !
dr. bailey ?
don &apos;t just stand there . get the meds .
let &apos;s go .
move fast . this thing &apos;s a ticking time bomb !
come on . come on . come on . come on .
almost there . done .
all right . let &apos;s go .
start a large @-@ bore i.v.
where &apos;s jackson ?
right behind us .
no , he &apos;s not .
hey .
your name is evie , right ?
i like your shoes , evie . those are really cool .
bet you can run pretty fast in those , huh ?
hey , you want to race ? i bet i could beat you .
come on . just grab my hand . we can go right now .
come on . here , take my hand .
i &apos;ve mobilized her spleen .
i considered splenic salvage ,
but i can &apos;t control the bleeding .
i did everything she said .
everything she said , dr. bailey .
another set .
move over .
where is meredith grey ?
i delivered her baby hours ago .
she should be in recovery .
she &apos;s not . where is she ?
hey , i have an idea .
why don &apos;t we go find your mommy , huh ?
yeah , come on .
i know where she is . we &apos;ll go find her right now .
come on , evie .
we &apos;re not gonna be able to salvage any of this .
i need to do a complete splenectomy
to get control of the hemorrhage .

i have to believe it &apos;s &apos; cause she had a great teacher .
you know , if you &apos;re gonna feel responsible
for making your ladies crazy or giving &apos; em cancer ,
then you should at least take credit
for helping make &apos; em great .
my baby &apos;s doing great .
i extubated her . she &apos;s on a nasal cannula .

i made a mistake .
i @-@ i can &apos;t ...

you will not believe
the night i have had so far .
callie .
lights .

is that arizona &apos;s ring
pinned to ... your scrub top ?
yeah.i mean , it must be ...
we had a pyloric stenosis baby .
projectile @-@ vomited all over the place .
i got soaked .
arizona ... was nice enough to lend me some scrubs .
thank you , by the way . you &apos;re a lifesaver .
this place looks so different in the dark .

you think the tree ruined my couch ?
i think it ruined your entire living room .

no , you don &apos;t .
you don &apos;t even know what i &apos;m gonna say .
i think i do , and you shouldn &apos;t .
jo
i &apos;ll mess it up , alex .
i mess everything good in my life up ,
and ... we work as friends really well ,
and--and i don &apos;t wanna mess that up .
you won &apos;t mess anything up .
last night , before the tree ,
you asked me a question .
you wanted to hear me say the words .
so i &apos;m ...
saying them right now .
i don &apos;t hear anything .
shut up .
okay , but ...
i &apos;m serious .

april ...
i haven &apos;t been fair to you , i know , and i &apos;ve--
i &apos;ve really hurt you .
and you &apos;re getting married .
when that bus exploded ,
and i thought you were gone , i ...
you &apos;re getting married .
unless you can give me a reason not to ?
oh , there you are .
how &apos;s meredith ? how &apos;s the baby ?
good .
think she &apos;s ready for , uh , visitors yet ?
yeah , sure . go for it .
well , we could , uh , go together .
do you know how much i love you ?
i do .
i felt ... such joy today
in that dark o.r ..
i could hear the blood moving .
i knew exactly what the heart muscle was thinking .
and i realized after ,
i feel that way all the time .
i &apos;m made for the o.r ..
even the boring procedures , i can feel ...
pure joy , content .
you feel that ...
with just me ?
what kind of a question is that ?
derek watches zola put applesauce in her ear ,
and he &apos;s enchanted .
you felt that way with ethan .
you &apos;re reading way too much into this .
okay , if you could stop for a second
and listen to your heart--
cristina , you don &apos;t know
what i want in my life .
am i enough , owen ?
do you really believe i &apos;ll be enough ?
i wish it were different .
no , no--
i &apos;m sorry .
cristina .
owen .
it already happened .
cristina , i said no .
i thought--i thought we were past the hard stuff .
i thought--i thought we were finally good .
we were . we--we are .
we &apos;re married !
i know .
we ... god , we have a child !
i know !
how could you do this ?
i don &apos;t know , except i did .
after all that &apos;s happened this year ,
everything we &apos;ve been through , everything we &apos;ve survived--
the bankruptcy , mark , the plane ...
oh , you weren &apos;t on the plane , callie !
you weren &apos;t in the woods ,
and you did not hear meredith crying for lexie
and mark moaning in pain
or hearing me scream in pain .
you weren &apos;t there ,
and you keep acting like you were ,
but you weren &apos;t , and it wasn &apos;t your experience !
i lost mark . you almost died . you--
&quot; i lost mark . you almost died . &quot;
you weren &apos;t on the freaking plane !
you want it ? the street cred ?
the badge of honor ? the warrior wounds ?
then great .
stick out your leg ,
and i will go grab a bone saw ,
and let &apos;s even the score !
it always comes back to the leg .
i trusted you , more than anything ,
more than anyone ... in my life .
and you decided to cut it off .
to save your life !
you didn &apos;t lose anything !
i did !
i did .
there &apos;s an end to every storm .
apparently , i lost you .
once all the trees have been uprooted ...
once all the houses have been ripped apart .
what do you think about bailey ?
bailey ?
you like it ?
i love it .
what do you think ?
the wind will hush .
the clouds will part .
the rain ...
yeah , that &apos;s your little brother .
will stop .
i heard what you did .
i couldn &apos;t be more impressed .
are you-- are you all right ?
y-- i need to talk to richard .
look , he @-@ he came to me .
he tried to help me ,
and i called him a drunk .
i @-@ i blamed him .
i turned on him . of all people , that man--
okay , hey , hey , hey , hey . it &apos;s okay .
he knows you , better than you think .
maybe you owe him an apology .
no , i owe him everything .
now do you know where he is ?
the sky will clear in an instant .
and only then ...
in those quiet moments after the storm ...
do we learn ...
who was strong enough ...
to survive it ?
