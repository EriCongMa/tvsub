I don't like quinoa. It's too grainy.
It's not a grain. It's a chenopod.
Well, I don't like "Keenopads."
Chenopod.
Quinoa is closely related to beets, spinach, and tumbleweed.
Tumbleweed?
Yes, put that at the top of my "Do not serve" list, too.
Are you having second thoughts?
Well, I can't back out now.
I mean, Dr. Nolan asked us
to do this presentation six months ago.
And, yes, I do not enjoy thinking about Hoyt.
I mean, serial killers go after complete strangers.
How'd I manage to get the one who wanted to get personal?
Well, you presented a unique challenge
to someone like Charles Hoyt.
So you're saying it's a compliment
that he tried to kill me?
I suppose.
Let's go over the presentation again.
Okay.
All right, two setups at the blood cottage.
The first is the West Roxbury mansion,
where we found Martin Yeager's body.
His wife, Gail, was missing,
but we found evidence of a second body
and eventually discovered Gail's body in a remote area.
What's the matter?
Just remembering the motile sperm I found on her body.
Yeah, right?
It's not bad enough that he's a serial killer.
No, no. Can be a necrophiliac, too.
Yay.
Three-day symposium
where we can re-live our four-year nightmare.
Only Dr. Nolan could convince me to do something like this.
Did you finish it?
Yes, I made myself, but I thought
she did a really good job with the forensics.
Yeah, I did, too.
She sold 100,000 copies so far.
America loves a serial killer.
Oh, can you get it?
Yeah.
Dr. Nolan. Hi.
Thank you. Please come in.
So nice to see you both.
Welcome.
This is my research assistant, Jack Roberts,
and my publicist, Tim Felding.
So nice to meet you, Detective, Doctor.
I've heard so much about you both.
We've been together for six months on my book tour.
Tim humors me by listening to my stories.
Hardly humoring you.
There is a reason that your book's a best-seller.
Well, congratulations on the success.
Thank you, but I'll be glad to get back to my research.
Would you like to join us for dinner?
Oh, that's very nice of you,
but I need to make some phone calls,
get ahead of any controversy over tonight's presentation.
You think the blood cottage will be controversial?
We have had press ask to cover it.
My worry is it might appear to be
a bit gratuitous to the layperson.
Well, let the press know
that it's a powerful investigative training tool.
What a great way to spin it.
What time should we pick you up?
Uh, we can take you.
Thank you.
That's very kind of you.
Great. Well, we'll see you there.
Lovely.
My new role as a book author came with an entourage.
Well, who doesn't love an entourage?
Mmm. This is so delicious.
Mm. Props, even for the quinoa.
Thank you.
Dr. Nolan, what is forensic psychiatry, exactly?
It's a branch of medicine that focuses on
the intersection of law and mental health.
And why did you decide to specialize in serial killers?
Mom.
It's all right. I get asked that a lot.
During my psychiatric residency,
a 5-year-old boy was referred to me for treatment.
Why? What happened to him?
Ma.
I want to know.
He'd strangled his puppy.
A 5-year-old?
Yeah. So, see? Tommy's not so bad after all.
Not funny.
Okay.
But what made you decide to focus on these three?
They were a good sample.
Charles Hoyt was a brilliant medical student,
which is unusual.
Why?
Well, most serial killers are of average intelligence.
Yeah, like these two --
Gilbert Dean Reeder was a trucker.
David James Johnson was married with children.
So, he had a family? Isn't that unusual?
No, not really.
How could his wife not know?
Well, not every serial killer
is a social misfit or a monster, ma.
Unfortunately, they're so normal,
they hide in plain sight.
That's what makes them so hard to stop.
Well, we should get going.
Why can't I go with you?
I told you, it is only for law enforcement.
Even I find the blood cottage disturbing.
It looks real, ma.
The crime-scene techs, they set up forensic dummies.
How do they make the dummies look real?
You'd be surprised.
They bleed synthetic gel. It's not pretty.
Okay. Who thinks of this stuff?
We agree on the definition of a serial killer --
three or more murders -- but what we don't agree on
are the investigative techniques,
and that's why we're here.
Tonight, we begin with Detective Jane Rizzoli
and Dr. Maura Isles.
If you've read my book...
...you know that these two were instrumental
in the capturing of serial killer Charles Hoyt.
追捕连环杀手
Thank you. It's very nice to be here.
Putting a stop to Hoyt's killing spree
became very personal for me.
During the course of my investigation,
Hoyt developed an obsession with me
and tried to kill me more than once.
The truth is, this is difficult to talk about.
I'm glad that he's dead...
because he can't hurt anyone else, ever.
But I will never stop wondering why.
We know about 70% of serial killers
were abused as children, and 60% have brain damage.
But we also know that every society has them.
So tonight, we focus not on why but on how --
how we investigate.
What you're about to see is a staged crime scene.
It's what we call a blood cottage.
We will show you how we analyzed the forensic details
of the murder of Martin Yeager and his wife, Gail.
When we arrived at the crime scene that you're about to see,
Martin Yeager was duct-taped and slaughtered,
and his wife, Gail, was missing.
Um, this teacup was one of Hoyt's signatures.
He, uh, would place it on the man's knee
and -- and use it as a warning device.
Does he look a little too real to you?
What's going on?
I don't know.
Excuse us just for a second, please.
He looks real because he is real.
Whoever did it wanted to get to us
- wanted to get to all of us.
It worked.
Jenkins.
What do you need, Detective?
Keep everybody at least 10 feet away from the stage, okay?
It's a crime scene, even if they are cops.
You got it.
Thanks.
You okay?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
What did you get from campus security?
Well, they said it's an all-cop symposium,
So there was no need for additional security.
They got that wrong.
Yeah.
What about access?
Auditorium is always open.
All right, tell the uniforms not to let anybody leave.
These guys are all cops, Jane.
Well, they're all suspects now.
All right.
You were right...
both BPD crime-scene techs.
Found their uniforms and badges backstage.
Kent Williams. June Ferguson...
I don't recognize either one of them. Do you?
No.
What's in the box?
Props they brought to dress the crime scenes.
All right, we're gonna need
all of the campus security footage, okay?
Made the calls. It's already coming in.
What do you make of this?
Everybody here had experience with serial killers.
This is like some taunt --
like, "I can do this, and you can't stop me."
Smacks of Hoyt, doesn't it?
I'm not sure.
But what about the teacup, Jane?
It's the same pattern as the Yeagers' crime scene.
Is there a teacup in the prop box?
Yeah.
Okay. That means the killer brought his own.
There are 100,000 copies of Dr. Nolan's book out there.
Is there a photo of the teacup in the book?
Right there.
Yeah, you can just make out the pattern.
So whoever has this book could've re-created this.
Yeah, it may not be connected to Hoyt at all.
So we're looking at, what --
8,000 BCU students, 950 faculty and employees?
And all those cops.
Can you estimate the time of death?
I measured their core temperatures.
They were both at 35 degrees celsius.
They died about two hours ago.
Let me show you something over here.
Looks like a burn.
Hoyt used a stun gun. That's not from a stun gun.
I found an identical mark on our male victim's arm.
Is that a burn or a branding?
Jane.
Um, go talk to her. Maybe she can help.
What should I do?
The detectives think
that we should keep the symposium going.
Why?
The suspect might be here.
You think he might be part of the law-enforcement community?
I'm wondering how I should respond to the press.
You should let the public information officer
handle it right now.
I have seen so many grisly photos
and videos of crime scenes, but I've never actually seen...
Dr. Nolan, are you all right?
Doctor, take a seat.
No, no, I'm fine.
I'm fine. I just...
You want some water?
No, no, no.
I-I-I knew them, the crime-scene techs,
June and Kent.
I asked them to do this. I feel responsible.
No, you are not responsible.
I can't believe that we were enjoying dinner
while this was happening.
Dr. Nolan, I know this hard,
but we are going to need your help.
Organized, controlled,
chose random victims, fearless.
Because he took out two police-department employees
at a symposium for serial killers.
Although until there's a third murder,
technically, he's not a serial killer.
The theatrical staging indicates he wants to play.
With us.
Which means this will escalate.
You think there'll be more?
I do, yeah.
The burns are significant.
None of Hoyt's apprentices ever added their own signatures.
Trace evidence is doing a complete work-up on the bodies.
I won't be able to do the autopsies till tomorrow,
but I'll be able to tell you more about the burns then.
Uh, we can wait downstairs if you're not finished.
Is it all right if I head back to the hotel?
Of course, yes. Thank you so much for your help.
We went through all the security footage.
There are no cameras monitoring the auditorium.
We're trying to track every person
who was on campus at the time of the murders.
That'll be thousands.
Yeah.
I matched credentials for all law-enforcement
against their registration for the symposium.
Everyone's who they said they were.
It's 2:00 A.M. Let's go home.
All right.
You can stay with me tonight.
No. I'm fine.
It's not him, Maura.
I know, but it's still stressful.
I want to go home, take a bath, and pet my dog.
I got to check on Kojak. She had puppies.
Kojak had a sex change?
Can we meet back here in six hours?
Hey, Jo.
You'd be barking like crazy if somebody was in here, right?
You can't wag your tail
and make friends if it's a bad guy, okay?
Okay, Jo. I'm overreacting, right?
Come here, sweetie.
On days like today, I think I'd like to be you.
Hello, Jane.
I'm sorry to have to wake you.
You looking for this?
Come in.
I wanted you to meet Theo.
Did I ever tell you how I learned to kill?
My first pup was named Rascal.
You remember what we talked about, right?
I still remember that first time,
when I could feel Rascal's pulse as the blood was pumping.
You know what I did, Jane, right?
You can't... No.
No!
Hey, Jo. Jo, come here.
Sorry, sweetie.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Maura, somebody's at the door.
It's Jane. She just called.
Thank you.
Hey, ma.
I just had the worst nightmare.
What was it about?
Rather not say.
Okay. Sit. You want some eggs?
No, just -- just coffee, please.
Okay.
Thanks, ma.
Okay. I want to know if I have PTSD.
I don't know. I'm not an expert.
But you've thought it.
Anybody who's gone through
the trauma you've gone through with Hoyt
would likely suffer from post-traumatic stress.
I just thought these nightmares would have stopped by now.
At least 75% of people suffering from post-traumatic stress
do have nightmares.
So I have it?
No, I didn't say that.
Can you just forget about it?
Well, actually, no.
No, don't forget about it.
There is something called imagery rehearsal therapy.
You replay the dream, Jane, but you change the way it ends.
Okay. I can do that.
It's just so real.
It was like it meant some-- do you think it meant something?
The science behind dreams isn't well-established.
Maura, I just want your opinion.
It doesn't have to be peer-reviewed.
Themes and patterns in dreams may be telling you something
your frontal cortices ignore when you're awake.
Take a sick day.
Have Sergeant Korsak and Detective Frost handle it.
Please, baby, stop.
Come on. Look at you.
You know I can't do that, ma.
Trace evidence didn't find anything
on the duct tape, the clothing, or the body.
That's too bad.
You see the pattern in the burn?
Yeah.
Well, there's a similar pattern in the male victim's burn.
So you think the killer used the same object to brand them?
Possibly. I'm taking an impression of both burns.
I'll have Frost run a description of
both burns through the ViCAP database.
But I'm not holding out hope.
We're gonna get a hit
on anyone that's ever been burned with a cigarette.
Anything?
Not yet. It's still drying.
Hoping to get a negative of a negative.
A who?
Well, a burn is a negative impression,
so a latex is a --
Negative-negative. Got it.
Okay, skip to the part
where you tell me what it was that burned them.
You know, I think it's healthy
that you've begun to process your trauma.
I knew I opened a can of PTSD worms today.
Can we just not talk about it, please?
No, your reaction is normal.
Okay. Have you talked to Dr. Nolan today?
Yes. She thinks that we should have
all of the symposium's participants
do a personality test.
All cops have taken it. I've taken it.
Yeah. Me too.
It's a requirement to get your license renewed.
And if the killer is law enforcement,
he'd have taken it,
which means he'll know what we're trying to do
and try to beat the test.
Yes. But I plan on comparing our results
to the ones on file.
Oh, good idea.
Neither impression is very clear.
So, four negatives.
Bummer.
CSRU didn't find anything at the crime scene.
Nothing? No hair, no fingerprints?
No saliva, no blood, not a damn thing.
Not even a footprint.
No one is this good the first time out.
Stupid friggin' way to try to solve a double homicide.
How many have you collected?
59. But everyone on the list signed in.
We should get all 120.
And you've been confirming identification?
Yes. They've been showing me photo I.D.s.
I've got better things to do.
You'd think they do, too.
If anyone gives you a hard time, let me know.
Oh, I can handle these guys.
Why would the killer re-create the Yeager murders?
That question kept me up all night.
There are different categories of serial killers.
This one seems to fall into
either thrill killer or power-seeker killer.
If I fail your test,
am I a thrill man or a power man?
Thank you, Detective Fletcher.
You know, in Pittsburgh, we wouldn't be farting around
giving personality tests to cops.
We'd have them help,
probably even have an arrest by now.
Thank you for your input.
Any time.
Take my card.
You call me when you're ready to solve this.
Grandiosity is the hallmark of psychopathy.
I can't wait to score Detective Fletcher's test.
We've identified these three --
Detective Mike Clemens, from Omaha,
Detective Reggie Jones, from New York,
and this one -- Detective Chuck Fletcher, from Pittsburgh.
All show the signs of evasiveness,
inconclusive responses, and defensiveness.
They tried to beat the test?
We think so.
We compared our tests
to tests their departments had on file.
So trying to beat it got them caught.
We noted high scores for ego and hostility
in all three of these,
along with an absence of empathy.
They're psychopaths.
Or sociopaths.
I'd need to do some more testing.
It's enough to round them up and interview them.
Did Detective Frost get anything on the ViCAP search
when he ran the burns?
Over a thousand hits.
Not much help.
Jane okay?
Yeah. Are you?
Yeah.
You know all our stories.
You've probably read my statements.
Yes, I did.
This must be very difficult for you, too.
You once rescued Detective Rizzoli
from Charles Hoyt.
I did.
Worst night of my life.
Wish I'd killed the son of a bitch.
Okay, thanks.
Clemens and Jones are in a seminar at the symposium.
Chuck Fletcher didn't sign in.
You look at Fletcher's file?
Yeah, got it right here.
He's a 15-year veteran
with a lot of black marks on his record.
45 complaints for use of excessive force?
That's a lot.
Got passed over for a promotion recently.
Disciplined for drinking on the job...
Serial killers are often substance abusers.
We got to find Chuck Fletcher.
Sergeant Korsak.
Okay, we're on it.
Get Jane.
They found a body at the BCU campus.
Is that dumpster emptied on a regular schedule?
I'll find out. Why?
I'm just thinking whoever dumped that body
was looking for maximum impact.
Killer knew once that dumpster was moved,
everybody's gonna get a good show.
Dead guy's a cop.
What?
Guess we can rule out Chuck Fletcher.
You're right, Jane.
Dumpster gets emptied at 10:05,
right as classes let out.
All right, come on. Let's take a look at the body.
Stabbed.
One wound under the solar plexus.
And look at his wrist.
That's the same burn.
So somebody lured him here.
That's why his gun's still in the holster.
Yeah. Either he knew his killer or he wasn't afraid of him.
Both ears were severed, and the damage to his eyes
appears to have been inflicted post-mortem.
See no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil.
Oh, god.
What is it?
The second killer that Dr. Nolan profiled --
that's what he did to his victims.
You think the serial killer
is working his way through my book?
I don't know.
But this could be directed at me?
I'm not a detective...
I don't have any family, and no one has threatened me.
All three of our victims
had ties to law enforcement and the symposium.
But what do you make of the copycat aspect?
Serial killers like to play out their own individual fantasies.
Exactly.
So why play out someone else's fantasy?
With the exception of the burn,
our killer is just re-creating murders.
Perhaps he's saying, "You solved this the first time,
but you won't solve it a second time."
He's certainly giving us a challenge.
The third killer in your book is David James Johnson.
Could that be next?
He looks like the perfect family man.
Doesn't he?
He used to chain his victims to a wall.
Drive knives, nails, or scalpels through their hands and feet,
usually while they were still alive.
4% of the population is either a sociopath or a psychopath.
Well, luckily, they're not all serial killers.
And I do think law enforcement serves as a deterrent.
Unlikely.
Serial killers are impulsive by nature,
fearless of consequences.
Jane, it's me!
Why are you yelling?!
I didn't want to scare you.
What are you doing here?
Spending the night.
What -- no, Frankie.
I don't remember inviting you.
Some whack-job has taken out three cops in the last 24 hours.
I'm not sleeping alone tonight. Neither are you.
Well, I'm not sleeping with you.
Come on.
If something happened to you, I couldn't forgive myself.
Nothing's gonna happen to me.
Please, get yourself a beer.
Thanks. I got one.
Jane, it's just me!
I got some food.
Hi, ma.
Hi. Hey, Frankie.
Hey, ma.
So, let me guess --
you're here to make sure the boogeyman doesn't get me?
Yes. That's what mothers are for.
So, who wants some lasagna?
But we could start with some chocolate.
You always get it first!
I want the hearts.
Frankie -- fine. I will give you the hearts.
I'm taking an impression of his burn.
Let's hope it's a better negative-negative this time.
Let's not anticipate results, but I think it might be.
I see something.
Looks like snakes on a stick.
Are those wings?
I think it could be the Rod of Asclepius,
which often gets confused with the Caduceus.
Who would get confused?
The Caduceus is two snakes
entwined around the Magic Wand of Hermes, topped by wings.
Right. Who doesn't know that?
You'd be surprised.
And Asclepius was an ancient Greek physician,
and that symbol is one snake, encircling a staff.
The medical symbol?
Yes.
Maura...
do you think June and Kent were burned by the same thing
that made this mark on Chuck Fletcher?
I think they were all burned by an object
that is approximately 1.9 by 1.5 centimeters.
That's his signature.
Let's run it through ViCAP.
Six hits with burns
that sort of look like the ones on our victims.
Maura, was the same object used to brand them?
The burns look similar, but the images just aren't good.
I can't be sure.
First murder was in 1988.
There wasn't another murder with that burn until 1999.
Why stop for 11 years?
Killer could've been incarcerated.
Many serial killers stop for long periods.
Frost, can you pull up the case file on the first murder?
It's a double murder --
A prominent Cleveland pediatrician and his wife.
Dr. Sheppard Appleton and his wife, Susan,
女儿幸存
were shot to death in a home invasion.
And their daughter survived by hiding in a closet.
So the first victims weren't law enforcement.
What about the other four murders?
No ties to cops. All random people.
What else do we know about that double murder?
Doctor was shot twice in the chest while watching TV.
Wife was hit in the abdomen,
crawled, shot another five times at point-blank range.
Can you say "Overkill"?
So these may or may not be related.
If they are related,
then our killer went from guns
to copycat serial murders.
Well, it's not unheard of in the research
for a serial killer to change his M.O.
Jane, what if none of these six unsolved murders
have anything to do with our three?
Then we're back to square one.
You sure you don't want soemthing?
I know it's a police station, but the food is good.
No, I'm good. Thanks.
I had Jack burn DVDs of all my interviews.
Thank you, Jack.
I'll meet you outside.
I hope it helps.
I can't imagine how,
but you're welcome to go through them.
Did any of these three men
ever mention communicating with anyone on the outside?
I don't think so.
But I do know that they all got fan mail.
Explain that one to me. You got any copies of those?
No, I'm sorry.
I'm a simple guy. I don't care why.
Just want to stop them.
I had a thought about how Detective Fletcher
might have been lured behind that dumpster.
Really?
Well, I want to confirm it first.
But I can take a look at the area
on my way to the next seminar at 4:00.
I'd like to go there with you.
Dog alarm. Got a new litter of pups.
Mom won't leave them.
Luckily, I live close by. I could meet you there.
Well, why don't I send Jack ahead
to get my PowerPoint presetation ready?
And we could swing by your place
and then take a look at the dumpster.
I don't want to slow you down.
My dog died right before my book tour.
It would be so good to just pet an animal today.
Well, come on, then.
Hey, Frankie, can you take these DVDs upstairs?
Sure.
You on puppy watch?
Yeah.
Any instructions?
Jane and Frost know what to look for.
So, what we're looking for
is any mention of someone on the outside.
Okay.
Oh, Jane, let me listen to the Hoyt interviews.
That's okay. I got it.
So, please talk to me about your family history.
I'd like to know the details
of the first time that you killed a living thing.
So, can we go back for a second
and talk me through that first murder again?
I'd like to ask you about detective Rizzoli.
Well, I love to talk about detective Rizzoli.
Don't be jealous.
We have a special relationship, too, Victoria.
Tell me why you like her so much.
I love your neck.
It's so beautiful.
And your breasts...
very firm.
Tell me, Jane -- what would you like to do to me?
I'd like to get my gun...
...and put it in your mouth and pull the trigger.
Okay?
Guns are so impersonal.
We're trained doctors, Victoria.
So was Sheppard.
"Sheppard"?
Just think --
think how exquisite it would've been to
feel Sheppard's pulse as
the blood drained out.
And Susan's, too, as she crawled...
Hoyt knew about the double murders in Cleveland.
What?
You think Hoyt did it? - No. There --
There's no way he could have.
He was training at Fort Stewart.
Those murders are the key.
Are those all the photos?
Oh. Just got one more.
Oh, my god.
Push in on his left wrist.
You see his cufflink?
The medical symbol. That has to be it, Maura.
It's the right size,
and it would make a similar impression.
Where's the other cufflink?
Frost, push in on his right wrist.
It's not there.
Spearmint okay?
Sounds delicious.
Oh. Who do we have here?
The dark one is Starsky,
and the little white one is Hutch.
They're rescues.
You're not married?
No.
Three wives, not one of them ever looked at me
the way my dogs do.
They think I'm the greatest man who ever lived.
Always glad to see me, aren't you, fellas?
Uh-oh. Mom's hungry.
Nursing takes a lot of calories. Come on.
The daughter, Tory,
was taken to a local hospital and treated for shock.
We should find her and talk to her.
She says in her statement to police she never saw the killer.
Well, maybe she did and was too scared to say.
She'd recently given birth.
Who? The wife?
The 14-year-old.
That's what the medical exams revealed.
Well, she didn't mention it to the police.
No. There are no hospital records of her giving birth.
Well, her father was a pediatrician.
Maybe it was a home birth?
Was she ever treated for broken bones?
Yes.
Uh, more than once.
But no reports of abuse?
No.
Check to see if Dr. Appleton
had privileges at the hospital where Tory was treated.
儿科医生 医学博士
He did.
So everyone who cared for his daughter worked for him.
That's why no one reported the abuse.
I think you might be right, Charles.
Knives and scalpels might be more satisfying.
Perhaps because it was my first time.
I was still conflicted.
You needed some distance, yes.
Big risk, giving us that interview.
Hardly.
Your colleagues won't be able to
put my complicated puzzle together.
You killed your parents.
And started again 11 years later?
In medical school?
Yes.
After I read about unsolved murders
that turned out to be the work of Charles Hoyt.
So organized, controlled, meticulous.
Why me?
You're a "simple guy."
You come home every day at 3:30 to feed your nursing dog.
I'll get Jack started,
and I'll still make it to the symposium by 4:00.
With my alibi and one for Jack, too,
no one will question me.
Do you think of yourself as part of the system, Sergeant?
I don't know what you're asking me.
Have you ever interviewed a teenage girl?
Many times.
And what would you do if that girl --
who is...14, let's say --
told you that she had been repeatedly raped
by her prominent father?
I'd arrest him.
Liar!
You would hide behind the system.
My mother hid behind her perfect home
and her respectable husband --
Dr. Appleton, pillar of the community.
Do you know how they explained my son to people?
Oh, I already know the story.
Please. I like hearing it.
Tell me.
They said he'd been abandoned at my father's office,
and they put him up for adoption.
I'm sorry.
Yeah.
Hello.
Do you know that you can desensitize a child
by having him practice violent behavior?
Makes sense. Is that what you did to Jack?
When I finally found him, yes.
Remember when you were 5...
and I taught you how to kill a puppy?
Yeah, mom.
I do.
Don't.
We're not here for the puppy.
We're here for you.
OK. Thank you.
That 14-year-old girl who witnessed her parents' double murder
went into foster care.
Why do you look so ominous?
Because she changed her name
from Tory Appleton to Victoria Nolan.
Oh, my god.
It's Dr. Nolan?
Yeah.
How? She was with us when the murders occurred.
She has a partner.
68% of female serial killers kill in teams.
Where did you get that from?
Her introduction.
Where is she right now?
Uh, she's gonna be at the symposium in 30 minutes.
Korsak's not back yet?
Yeah, where is he?
He's taking his sweet time today.
Maybe he's getting a little more than puppy love.
What do you mean?
What? He and Dr. Nolan went back to his house to feed his dog.
Frost.
Jack, use the carbon-steel scalpel.
All right.
You trained him well.
Haven't I?
I let him do the last three on his own.
How many have you done together?
Not enough.
Tell him what we have planned.
Charles Hoyt preferred to go
between the palmar interosseous bones.
Like he did with Jane.
But David felt it was more painful to split the ulna
and the radius bones.
Don't make your son do this.
I don't make him do it. He enjoys it.
Oh, I do.
I have so many good memories of doing this with my mom.
This isn't random.
This is personal.
Yes, it is.
I hold you responsible for what happened to Charles.
A little help down here!
You cut his work short. He had so much left to do.
It's time.
Jack, give me his gun.
Charles taught me guns ruin the experience.
How many?
Murders? Oh, it's crass to count.
We don't brand them all. It'd make it too easy.
But we'll brand you.
Not yet.
Take the scalpel.
Yes, I know the sequence.
Carbon steel...
Why do you let her tell you what to do?
She doesn't tell me what to do.
Stop wasting time, Jack.
Sorry, mom.
And here I thought you were doing this all by yourself.
Obviously. You've been at the crime scenes.
You've seen my work.
No. What I've seen is your mother telling you what to do.
His hands, Jack, now.
All right!
How old are you? 25?
You let your mother tell you what to do?
Finish it!
Yeah, I'd never put up with that.
Shut up!
You telling me or you telling her?!
I said finish it!
Shut up!
Now look what you made me do!
Don't move, you piece of crap.
Call an ambulance.
You okay?
Not for me, for them.
There's bolt cutters in that tool bag.
Yeah, I need E.M.S.
at 6424 Dorchester Avenue.
Oh, let him die.
He's always reminded me of my father.
Make her walk, Frost.
Come on.
You sure you're okay?
Yeah.
I am glad to see you, though.
Well, I always did want to rescue you.
Come on.
Oh. Pretty cold, huh?
Her telling us to let her son die.
Psychopaths are incapable of forming relationships.
Poor kid.
That "poor kid" hit you in the head with a 2x4.
He was gonna drive a scalpel through you.
I'd have shot him through the nuts, if they'd hurt my dogs.
Well I really like your porch, Sergeant.
It must be nice to have a porch.
Yeah, you can check out your neighbors.
Got any cute ones?
Yeah. Three sisters live next door.
Your age or our age?
Go knock. Check for yourself.
It's nice to finally see your home, Vince.
It's nice having you. Next time bring some food.
Yes...
We're rushing over this time.
Yeah, ok, that was good thinking.
Cheers.
Cheers.
