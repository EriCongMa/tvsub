I've been tracking down my missing RV.
Toby gave it to "A," but Spencer already knew that.
I'm sorry.
Toby just isn't ready to let you guys know what's going on yet.
I found this. Red coat is "A," right?
We're looking for a blond.
It's not this.
E·兰博
E. Lamb? Eddie lamb?
That's me.
E·兰博
I'm sorry. I'm not interested.
How many points for the word "Slut"?
Stop! That's my car! What are you doing?!
I kinda wish I had done it.
If anything like this happens to you again,
I wanna be ready.
It's the gun. At least I think it is.
Why do you have that?
Because I found it in my mom's closet. I have to get rid of it.
Hold it! Don't move!
That gun was used to kill Detective Wilden,
and your mother's fingerprints are on the bullets.
I've got a key to sign in.
Come on, guys. Let's go.
'Cause we're breaking in to Wilden's apartment.
Look for letters, pictures--
anything that might connect Wilden to Shana and Jenna.
If she doesn't find that key, we're gonna have a problem.
We can't afford for me not to be working.
Could you just put Bob Larabee on the phone?
He took the initial report.
Thanks. I'll wait.
Bob? No, no, no, we're -- we're in the motel.
I have to meet the insurance adjustor over there about 2:00,
but look, before we do --
Yes, I understand it was a stolen car,
but no sign of the driver?
I mean, if he was strung-out
enough to drive straight into my living room,
then how did he get away so fast?
No, no.
Look, I know you're doing everything you can,
but this car crashed into my house.
My daughter could've been sitting in that room.
Look, I'm just gonna call you back
after I meet with the adjustor, okay?
All right, thanks. Bye.
How does someone just run away from an accident like that
without one neighbor seeing him?
You better bring a jacket.
It's supposed to get cold tonight.
I'll come straight home after school to help you unpack.
Don't you have a college guidance session today?
Yeah, it was scheduled for this morning, but I figured...
Honey, don't miss that, please.
Mom, I wanna help you out.
You can help me by thinking about your future.
还行 你妈妈呢
How are they?
She said they're fine.
"A" really likes throwing cars at people.
Is there any chance this really was an accident?
Yeah, that's what I thought.
No, okay, "A" did this, but why?
To keep us off balance, keep us from finding red coat,
or Cece Drake, or whoever we're dealing with.
Well, I think it really was Cece,
and I hope that Toby and Caleb find her.
God, Spence, what is taking your mom so long?
Courts run on judge-time, not lawyer-time.
Well, it's an arraignment.
All they have to do is set bail and she can go.
She said that she would call you
the minute that your mom was released.
Just take a breath, all right?
Mom?
Hi. Have you girls had breakfast?
Mrs. Hastings, where's my mom?
Spencer, why don't you take Aria upstairs for a minute?
No.
No, I want them here.
Hanna, we entered a plea of not guilty,
but the judge refused to grant bail.
No.
Why?
First degree murder of a police officer,
a district attorney who doesn't want to make any more mistakes.
But we're definitely going to appeal.
Okay, and how long is that gonna take?
The papers will be on the judge's desk this afternoon.
But some things have been put in motion.
What sort of things?
Hanna, your mother is going to be transferred to another location.
What location?
She's being remanded to the state prison in Muncy
until the trial.
They'll move her tomorrow.
God, you promised.
Honey, I'm sorry.
I should be the one in jail, not my mom.
Hanna, you didn't do anything wrong.
Yeah, somebody killed Wilden
and "A" is taking advantage of that.
It's not your fault.
My mom went out there to protect me,
how is this not my fault?
It's Caleb. I can't talk to him right now.
Hanna, my mom is a really great lawyer.
Well, then why isn't my mom out?
Because it's just one hearing.
She'll win the case. She always does.
Always?
Okay, so do you wanna go to school? Or not go?
No, you guys go. I'll be okay.
Are you sure?
I'm gonna have to see my dad.
If my mom doesn't come back,
then I have to move in with him and the gruesome twosome.
You guys go. I'll be fine.
Okay.
Spence, tell your mom I'm sorry
if I yelled at her.
She's an attorney, okay? She's used to it.
A really good one.
Okay, well, call us if you need anything, all right?
Yeah. I'll be good.
Hey, Aria.
Sorry.
No, I'm sorry.
Hey, so I'm gonna be out late tonight with the team.
I'm checking in with you
in case dad calls from Syracuse.
But please don't say I have a curfew.
What's going on with the team?
We're celebrating after the game.
How do you know that you're gonna be celebrating?
Well, if we win, it's a celebration.
If we lose, it's a party.
So, what time do you think -- - Just don't wait up.
Mike, what time are you -- - It's important.
I need to spend time with these guys.
Why?
It's different...
since the thing with Connor's car.
Well, what's that have to do --
I'm handling it.
Where did you get that bag?
I'm taking a class there.
In martial arts? Why?
There's nothing wrong with learning how to defend yourself.
So is it an elephant?
A dinosaur?
Oh, come on, Malcolm, you need to give me a hint.
oh, okay, is it supposed to be me?
Uh, well, hey, listen, Rembrandt.
We're gonna talk about this later. I'm with a student now.
But, okay. Love you. Bye.
Hey, come in.
I didn't even think you were gonna be here.
Yeah, me neither.
But my mom wants me to focus on the future,
with or without a house.
Oh, my God, Emily, I'm so sorry.
I can't even imagine what the two of you must be...
feeling.
Do the police have any idea?
They're still investigating.
They know it was a stolen car.
We don't have to do this now.
With the accident and
everything that's going on with Hanna's mom --
If I don't, then I'll start missing deadlines.
Just start thinking that things are gonna get better, right?
Right.
Emily, when I first got here, you and your friends
were dodging some pretty serious threats.
And I know that Mona confessed to a lot of that,
but is there anybody else who still wants to hurt you?
Is history repeating itself?
You guys took a long time to speak up,
and if this is happening again --
It was an accident.
Some speed freak lost control
and used my front porch as a bumper.
Where is this college?
Maryland.
She isn't answering my calls.
She's really ragged right now.
She thought her mom was gonna get bail. We all did.
I just don't like her being alone, you know?
Well, she said that she's gonna call her dad.
Come on. That's not any better than being alone, if you ask me.
Look, I'm gonna cut after English
and make sure she's not at home still hiding under my sheets. Okay?
How are the rest of you doing?
We're just dandy.
Spencer...
I drove by Emily's, okay?
They're still pulling pieces of that car out of the living room.
So, I'm gonna ask you again: How are you doing?
We're trying to stay positive.
If "A" is escalating things,
maybe it means that we're getting too close for comfort.
Maybe you and Toby are getting too close to Wilden's killer.
Anyway, that number that you pulled from Nigel's cell phone,
did you ever figure out who was on the other end?
Somebody really smart.
The number is assigned to three people and three addresses.
All in New York.
Well, which one is real?
I don't know. That's why Toby went to New York --
to knock on some doors, see who answers.
Maybe Cece Drake.
Maybe.
Okay, will you please just have Hanna call me?
I will.
Thank you.
This college is tiny.
Is it worth even filling out an application?
Why not?
Well, if there's hardly any slots --
Well, let's not write our own rejection letter quite yet.
You probably have a better shot than most people.
Mr. Fitz, I don't swim anymore.
No, I'm talking about your work outside of the pool.
These little colleges are looking to build communities.
And they'd probably be pretty excited
about the work you did last summer in Haiti.
That was for, like, three weeks.
Yeah, three weeks you spent volunteering,
Thinking about others and not yourself.
That's... pretty impressive.
I don't feel very impressive.
Are you still in touch with any of your old supervisors?
I only had one. Zoe.
Call her.
Ask her to write you a reference.
Somebody's gotta remind you who you really are, Emily.
Hello?
Hello. You have a collect call
from an inmate in a correctional facility.
Ashley Marin.
If you wish to accept and pay for the call,
please press three now.
Hanna.
Mom. Are you okay?
So far.
Veronica told you about the bail
and how they're gonna move me?
Yeah. Yeah, she told me.
I don't want you to worry about this, sweetheart.
We are going to get through this.
I miss you.
I miss you.
We are going to be all right.
God, it's not fair.
They can't take you away like this.
Right now it's not fair, but things can change.
Yeah. Yeah, they can.
Veronica's gonna bring you here tomorrow
so we can say...
So I can see you, okay?
Okay.
I love you, mom.
I love you.
I should let you go.
Okay.
Bye.
Thanks for coming.
What do you want?
I'm gonna confess to killing Detective Wilden.
You're gonna help me.
Whatever they do to me will be as bad as what they do to her
That's probably true.
You're taking an awful big chance.
I can't let my mom go to prison
I mean talking to me.
Suppose I'm the one who actually set up your mother.
Were you serious when you said
you never wanted this "A" to hurt my mom?
Yes, I was.
Well, then you have to help me do this.
Why me?
Because this is going to be the biggest lie I've ever told.
I need you to make it sound perfect.
Me, Spencer, the others,
we all tell lies,
But you're the only one who actually knows how to live in a lie.
Hanna?
Who are you?
I'm Beckett.
Sam or Saint Thomas?
圣托马斯·贝克特 坎特伯雷大主教
Beckett Frye. You must be Spencer, right?
Yeah. What are you doing here?
I'm interning with your mother.
Goldberg Penn Law School alumni fellow.
Right, that's why you'd be at her office,
Why are you in our kitchen?
Blame the District Attorney.
Discovery in the Marin case.
They send you everything and make you wade through it.
D.A. got cute and sent to your mother's home address
instead of her office.
Somebody's in a jail cell. They make it like it's a game.
It is a game.
That's why they use the words "Winning" and "Losing."
You're gonna make a great lawyer.
Thanks.
Do you have many more of these?
Plenty.
Let me give you a hand.
What do you think you're doing here?
I'm the one who killed Detective Wilden. I did it.
Go home, little girl. You're just trying to save your mother.
No, she's just trying to take the blame. I did it.
You can't just keep repeating, "I did it."
You have to tell them
how you did it and why you did it.
Okay, I know that.
Everything that seems to point to your mom,
make it point to you, okay?
Motive. What's your motive?
He was threatening me because I told people
he got Alison Dilaurentis pregnant.
I think he might have killed her.
That's good. That's really good.
I think they sent us Wilden's grammar school report cards.
No, I checked the box numbers before I signed for them.
No, your daughter's here.
Your mother wants to know why you're not at school.
I'm checking on Hanna.
You hear that?
No, she's the only one here.
No, don't worry about it.
Yeah, yeah, take your time.
I'm gonna be fine. I promise you.
Hey, Jake.
Hi. Thank you so much.
I'm not taking you away from a class, am I?
I'm good.
So I think that my little brother is taking a class from you.
Mike...
Montgomery. Yeah, great kid.
Yeah, I'm actually really worried about him.
Has he said something to you?
Something that someone like me should know about?
I know that I shouldn't even ask that.
Since you are, it must be important.
Yeah, thank you.
He did say something odd.
What?
He said, "it's hard to focus on the game
when your own teammates are playing against you."
What does that mean?
I'm guessing some of his teammates think he's an easy target.
What is it with your family? First you, now your brother.
You didn't tell him that I said that I was scared, did you?
No, I didn't, but --
I don't want you to. It's --
I won't.
Okay.
It's important. He doesn't need to worry about me.
Aria, I know we had the conversation
about you not being... available.
But if you're scared and you need help,
I'm here for you...
without any complications.
Okay?
Hello.
Hello.
I thought it was time I thanked everybody who looked after me.
You're welcome.
I brought you something.
达伦·威尔登 W-46809
Have a cookie.
The night Toby's mom died you were questioned by police.
By Detective Wilden, only he was Officer Wilden then.
I wasn't questioned, I was interviewed.
Come on, Eddie.
They talked to everyone who was working that night.
And what did you say?
You've read it.
"Subject reported patient Cavanaugh
"was not in her room at bed check.
"He discovered the roof access door unlocked.
"He went up to the roof and looked over the east ledge
and saw a body on the ground below."
That's what Wilden wrote in his notes.
Yeah, that's what I told him.
Then why in the official report
Does it say that she jumped from a window and not the roof?
It doesn't make any difference, the woman's dead.
If it doesn't make any difference,
then why would Wilden change the facts when he filed the report?
Why would he lie?
Why does anybody lie?
You think somebody paid him off
to lie about how Toby's mom died?
Didn't you ever wonder how a guy like Wilden
goes from being patrolman to detective so fast?
You should have told somebody when they filed the report.
Tell who? The police? Wilden was the police.
Well, Toby deserves some answers... and so do I.
Spencer, if I were you, I would put this back
where I found it and forget that I ever saw it.
It's not going to change anything,
not for you, not for me, and not for Toby's mother.
Yeah, well, my friend Hanna's mother
is sitting in jail accused of killing Wilden,
so I need to know who else wanted to see him dead.
The police took all the high heels in my house.
My mother's, mine.
And left you with nothing but flats?
That's barbaric.
You said there was a woman's shoeprint where Wilden was killed.
Are they going to find a match
with something from your mom's closet?
I don't think so.
Why not?
'Cause there's a pair missing.
Manolos. They had mud on them.
They were hidden under the sink, and then they were gone.
You threw them out.
No, they just weren't there anymore.
No, Hanna, you threw them out.
They're the shoes you were wearing
when you met Wilden at the lake and shot him.
I did?
You tried to clean them and when you couldn't,
you threw them away.
You wore those shoes that night, not your mother.
You threw them out.
I threw them out because they were my mom's
and I didn't want anyone to think that those were her prints.
You see? It all makes sense now, doesn't it?
Now let's talk about the gun.
有汉娜的消息吗
You didn't tell me you came from perfect town, U.S.A.
Zoe, great to see you.
Hey. This town is almost as photogenic as you.
Almost.
Was this really on your way?
It was close enough.
I figured when I got your email, it was worth the detour.
So where you been, Joe Dimaggio?
You don't call, you haven't answered any emails,
nobody's heard from you in months.
I know, I'm sorry.
I really did wanna stay in touch, it's just...
It's been a little, um...
I've been busy.
Keeping busy is good.
I was just worried that you were still dealing with losing Maya.
Still miss her.
You don't have to tell me.
I saw your face when you got off the plane.
I thought it would take an entire summer to rebuild you.
Was I any help at all that summer?
Or was I just another disaster area?
Excuse me?
By the third day, you were M.V.P. of the entire team.
We had to pry the electric drill out of your hands.
I'm putting a crew together this summer,
and I wish I had an Emily on every single team.
Where are you guys going this summer?
Nicaragua.
Why? Do you wanna come?
I don't think this is what you expected
when you got involved with my daughter.
No, it's not.
I'm sorry about that.
Thank you for coming.
I'm worried about Hanna.
She's worried about you.
I can't help her from here.
I can't do anything from here.
I'm worried about what she might do...
if things don't work out.
Did she say anything?
Nothing.
But I know how she thinks and...
she wants results and she will charge
right into a situation without thinking and...
she gets that from me.
I think she gets a lot of things from you.
She's brave, she's loyal...
And stubborn.
She can be.
She's very angry right now,
and I don't want her making any mistakes because of that.
She listens to you.
Yeah, sometimes.
She does.
More than you know.
I'll do whatever I can.
Thank you.
Visiting hours are now up.
Visitation is over.
Mrs. Marin...
Hanna loves you.
She would do anything for you.
That's what I'm afraid of.
So you haven't been in a pool since...
The accident? No.
Well, maybe we need to rethink handing you the power tools.
I mean, we can find something a little less physical.
No, I'll be fine by next summer.
It's not permanent, the injury.
It's all behind me.
I'm not looking to swim in college and --
You don't need to sell yourself to me, Emily.
I could write you a glowing recommendation in my sleep.
Emily.
Mom.
What are you doing here?
I'm sorry to interrupt.
Oh, this is Zoe, uh, my supervisor for Habitat for Humanity.
致力于消除全球贫困住房和无家可归的现象
Oh, right, right. It's nice to see you.
I figured you were working today.
What's wrong?
I had to meet with a second adjustor,
and it looks like we're not gonna be back
in our house for months.
But I need to get this to the police,
and I was wondering if maybe...
Yeah, I understand. You shouldn't have to walk in there.
I'll drop it off.
Thanks.
I'll see you back at home.
Well, back at the motel.
Yeah.
It was really great to see you again.
You too.
You're living in a motel?
Yeah, just for now.
It's a long story.
Sounds like you have a lot going on.
Maybe I should've checked in a little bit more
before I roped you into this again.
No, I wanna go with you guys next summer.
Is the sign-up form in here or should I do it online?
Where did you get the gun?
I found it in my father's desk.
I was afraid of Wilden,
so I took it in case he ever tried anything.
They found your mother's fingerprints on the bullets.
I don't know anything about that.
Look, my dad had that gun when he lived with me.
My mom probably loaded it once.
But I was the first one to ever shoot it.
And you shot it at Wilden.
Yes.
You followed him to the lake and you shot him.
That's right.
What was that like?
What?
You killed someone.
He was as close to you as I am
and you shot him.
What did that feel like?
What the hell kind of question is that?
The sort of question that will let them know
whether you're lying or telling the truth.
Make me believe you were there.
Tell me what you did.
Hello, Hanna.
Look what I found.
Mommy's not gonna be able to fix this one for you, Hanna.
And just like that, you pulled the gun on him.
Self-defense, Hanna.
Remember? We're going for self-defense.
He must have said something, done something.
But maybe you can fix this one for yourself.
I mean, you are your mother's daughter.
I've been tried to reach you.
I know.
I thought you were supposed to be with your dad.
He had a work thing.
Hanna, what is she doing here?
Oh, it's so nice to see you, too.
Caleb, look, Mona found out about my mom
and she came here.
We just...
We've been through a lot,
so we're just trying to move on.
Mona doesn't move on, she goes right through.
Don't you, Mona?
I don't have the slightest inkling
of what you're talking about.
Caleb, you were looking for me,
you found me, and I'm okay.
Like hell you're okay.
It's complicated and I don't do complicated.
Okay, if my mom doesn't get out of jail,
I have to move in with my dad, his wife,
her blonde tarantula of a daughter.
So compared to that,
talking to Mona makes all the sense in the world.
It's my calming influence.
God, just leave me alone.
Okay? For now.
Sure.
I'll leave you alone.
We're almost finished.
Hey.
Hi.
Honey, your dad wants you to meet him
at the club for dinner.
We're gonna be working here for awhile.
Okay.
I didn't hear you leave.
You were busy.
By the way...
do you want me to slip that file back in the box
before your mother notices?
What file?
I'll take care of it.
Suit yourself.
Mike's phone.
Who's this?
Mike's butler. Who's this?
It's his sister. Can you just put him on the phone, please?
Hey, guys. Guys, is Mike back there?
He's not conscious.
Yet.
Just put Mike on the phone okay?
Now.
Hello?
Hello?
Tell me again.
I saw him in town.
You saw who in town?
Detective Wilden.
I followed him out to the lake,
and I saw his car there.
But they found his car in town.
I don't know anything about that,
but I saw his car at the lake.
Did you see anyone else there?
No.
Wilden was...
angry.
He's gonna blame all of this on my mom. I know it.
He's been after me and my mom.
Why?
Because of what he did to Ali.
No one believes us. No one will help us.
He wants to hurt my mom.
Well, now it's his turn to be scared.
And I'm gonna make him stop.
You did this.
I'll do worse if you don't leave us alone.
You're in very big trouble, Hanna.
I can make your mother's life a living hell.
Unless, that is, you and I work something out.
He hurt your mom. He wants to hurt you.
He's got all the power. Nobody's going to help you.
You're the only one in the world who can do anything about it.
You're all alone out there.
Bugs are getting in your hair
and the lake smells like something died in it.
What happened next?
Two, Hanna.
You shot him twice.
And then I ran away.
Who moved the car and put the body in the trunk?
I don't know.
All I know is I killed him.
I shot him with my father's gun
'cause he was after my mom
And no one was gonna help us.
Are you sorry that you killed him?
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm sorry.
Of course you are.
All you have to do now is tell the truth...
And everything will be all right.
Where do you think you are going?
You didn't think I'm gonna leave you alone with her, did you?
Hi.
Have you heard from him?
No.
Where does the team usually hang after the game?
I don't know. I just know that
they played Richland.
Uh, was he at a house party?
Well, it kind of sounded like
he was at a bowling alley, just not as loud.
There were all these crashes and pings and --
an arcade.
I know a place near there.
Uh, you know, I don't remember the street.
Okay, um...
Should we just get in your car and drive there?
Yeah, let's do it.
Hold on, it's him.
Mike, hey. Where are you?
Your friend said that you were unconscious.
Undressed?
No, not undressed. Unconscious.
He was just messing with you.
Are you okay?
Yes, I'm fine.
I might just stay at Billy's tonight.
You're not coming home at all?
It's three blocks away, okay? I'll see you in the morning.
Why would he just put me through that?
He doesn't know I told you about his teammates.
So he probably doesn't know why tonight scared you so much.
Right.
Great, so now I'm spying on him.
You're his sister.
Mike's a great guy.
He's got his struggles, but he's working on 'em.
I think he can take care of himself.
You think?
If it gets out of control, I'll tell you.
Okay.
And honestly...
I'm more worried about you.
You want me to stay for a while?
Yeah, are you hungry?
I'll take that as a yes.
And you let Mona talk you into this?
Mona is helping me. It was my idea.
Hanna, it's insane.
First of all, you can't do it.
Second of all, you would never pull it off.
And third, I am not gonna let you do it.
I have to do this.
Maybe "A" will settle for
ruining my life and leave my mother alone.
Neither one of you is going to prison.
My mother's already there.
If they take her away tomorrow, I'll never get her back.
Look, it'll be okay. I'll be fine.
You will be fine?
Hanna, you're talking about going to prison, okay?
Prison for kids is still prison.
You don't need to do something just because you feel guilty
about something that somebody else did.
You think she killed him.
You think my mom shot Wilden.
I did, okay?
Until I talked to her today.
She never killed anyone.
I didn't know you were going shopping. I could've helped.
I just picked up some of the essentials.
Um, we're gonna try to eat out most of the time.
But... did you drop off the --
Yeah, and everybody at the precinct asked about you.
They're gonna want you back, mom.
I think they already feel bad.
It doesn't matter how they feel, Em.
It's, uh... it's already done.
I'm gonna be starting to look for other work tomorrow.
I had a great meeting with Zoe.
She's gonna write me a recommendation letter for college.
That's wonderful.
I'm glad there's someone in your corner.
She's leading a crew in June to Nicaragua,
invited me to come.
Wants me to join the group
for the whole summer until I start school.
She even said that she'd give me some sort of leadership role
where I'd be, like, a team captain or something
and supervise the new volunteers.
Mom?
What's wrong?
Nothing.
It sounds like a great opportunity.
I don't have to go for the whole summer.
I can come back in August.
You know, see what happens with the house.
Maybe if dad comes back, he can spend time...
Stop. You don't need ot organize your whole calendar around me.
This is a really important summer for you.
Mom...
Have you eaten?
Why don't you let me make you something to eat?
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
We can eat later, okay?
I'll fix you something.
I'd like to speak to a detective
about a murder.
Hey, I'm sorry if I hijacked your night.
It's fine.
I'm happy to be here.
Now, what are you in the mood for?
Comedy? Rom-com? Sci-fi?
Insidious 2.
Have you seen the first one?
Twice.
This one looks even more terrifying.
Fun terrifying.
It opens next weekend. You wanna go?
Sure, it's a...
Sounds good.
What did you think of Beckett?
I don't think anything yet.
You'll like him. He's smart.
Did you talk to Hanna?
Yeah, she's with her dad.
What's gonna happen to her mom?
They'll move her to the state facility tomorrow,
which is excessive
and interferes with my ability to mount a defense.
And I'll keep after Judge Reilly until she agrees to bail.
Meanwhile, she stays in a cell?
Yeah.
Oh, I should have warned Beckett about you.
Do you know what's in there?
They're trying to choke us with Wilden material.
Most of it is useless.
That is not useless.
That is about Wilden and Radley and Toby's mom.
Wilden was at Radley the night that Toby's mom died,
And what he wrote in his notes doesn't match the official report.
Somebody paid him off to lie about the facts.
It's not relevant.
Not relevant?
Wilden was crooked. He was always crooked.
Spencer, you're done with Radley.
Be grateful for that.
Mom, Toby thinks his mother killed herself.
Maybe she didn't.
And this links what happened out there with Wilden.
Honey, nothing we do or say is gonna bring back Toby's mother.
If you want to help toby, help him move on.
Yes?
No, I haven't.
What do you mean?
When did this happen?
All right, I'll come right down there.
Mona Vanderwaal is at the police station.
She just walked in and confessed to killing Wilden.
