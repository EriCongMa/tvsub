so your flight leaves tomorrow , so ...
yes , if we &apos;re ever gonna have sex , we gotta do it right now .
now , what @-@ what i was actually gonna say
is do you want to print your boarding pass at the airport
and use their ink instead of ours ,
but i like that yours ended with sex .
i said sex , but i meant meaningless sex .
oh , i heard that . that &apos;s what i heard .
i heard meaningless sex .
....... n my room .
yeah , i &apos;m right behind you .
time @-@ wise . i &apos;m not pitching positions .
okay , great .
holy ...
oh , my god !
i am so sorry .
nobody was here when i got home ,
and the bed just looked so good ,
i went full goldilocks , and you must be reagan !
it &apos;s so good to meet you .
i put on my special underwear , because ...
nick !
jess is back !
and i made a promise
to myself when you left
i &apos;d be wearing these when you came back !
and i &apos;m doing it .
oh , my god ! thank you !
i &apos;m doing it . i &apos;m doing it .
all right , great , i &apos;m gonna get out of here .
no , stay .
nah ! nah !
the la county courthouse gift shop is straight up bull .
can you believe i had to have these shirts made ?
yeah , i can believe that .
where &apos;s reagan ? probably putting on her shirt still .
yeah , reagan &apos;s not exactly the matching t type .
i @-@ i feel like the moment has passed , don &apos;t you ?
yeah , i feel like it &apos;s so passed .
yeah .
that &apos;s the thing about moments , though .
they come and they go . they &apos;re fleeting .
that &apos;s a moment .
this is a moment .
which makes me believe that although
that one passed , maybe it ...
it &apos;s also just , um , i &apos;m leaving tomorrow .
yeah .
so we don &apos;t want to make it complicated .
i mean , right now we &apos;re just roommates
that made out a couple of times .
well , i &apos;m glad we talked this out .
now your last day here won &apos;t be weird .
nothing about this conversation
makes me believe that that is true .
yeah .
glad it &apos;s not gonna be weird .
winston &apos;s weekly letters .
90 % redacted , but still full of news .
&quot; i &apos;ll leave you with my thoughts on the trial . &quot;
big black line , big black line .
they redacted that stuff ?
big black line .
&quot; lol . &quot; big black line .
&quot; gotta go , or i &apos;ll be late for my first dance class . &quot;
you know , actually the dance class has become
more of a dance gathering .
you know what , maybe schmidt and i will join you ,
because the wedding is almost here ,
and we have to work on our first dance .
come . i mean , you know , two more referrals
and i get to have my birthday party there .
hey , reagan .
hello .
how was jury duty ?
jury duty was quite simply the tops .
did i have a knack for it ?
i suppose . was i elected foreman ?
unanimously .
am i going on the news tomorrow
to explain the verdict to laymen non @-@ jurors ?
you know i am .
nice !
and yet ,
i nearly threw it all away for love .
his name was juror 237b ,
and we made the courthouse
our hothouse .
blood splatters , mucous seeps .
but nothing could happen between us ,
because , as every american knows ,
personal contact through the exchange
of personal information
between members of a sequestered jury
is strictly forbidden .
but i promised myself ,
once the trial had ended ,
i would find him .
extra ! extra !
&quot; i &apos;m gonna find that juror , &quot; vows jessica day !
page two : it &apos;s war in the pacific !
what ? !
schmidt ...
i ... schmidt !
i need your help .
this is reagan &apos;s last day .
i know it is , and you know what ?
whatever embarrassments or failures
the rest of your life may hold ,
no one can ever take away
what you &apos;ve accomplished this week .
a goddess walked among us ,
and you went to first base with her .
several times .
and i actually did a really good job kissing her .
but now i &apos;m making it weird .
no .
yeah , every time i open my mouth ,
i &apos;m tarnishing my legacy a little bit .
but i have a plan . i &apos;m gonna shut up .
love it .
i &apos;m not finished yet . there &apos;s more to my plan .
do you need more ?
yes , i need more .
what more could there be ? just shut up .
i &apos;m going to shut up
until we say good @-@ bye .
and then ...
i &apos;m gonna hit her with a goosebumps walkaway .
i don &apos;t know who he is .
is he an old @-@ fashioned baseball player ?
goosebumps walkaway is the line
that they guy says to the girl
in the movie that gives her goosebumps
and then he walks away forever .
it &apos;s that line that ...
that haunts her .
that consumes her .
that rings in her ear for all of eternity ,
granting you ...
immortality .
you &apos;re damn right . immortality .
come here . i want to say
good @-@ bye to you .
but it &apos;s not true .
so @-@ so bad @-@ bye , reagan .
bad ... bye .
okay , that was terrible .
now , go write 20 more .
learn them , inhabit them , practice them ,
and then throw those away .
then write another 20 and submit them to me for my approval .
can bad @-@ bye be one of them ?
no .
so 40 new ones .
yeah .
that &apos;s too ... that &apos;s excessive .
so , what is your plan for finding this guy ?
i &apos;m typing words i know about him into a computer .
handsome plus los angeles plus 237b ...
... is a dead end .
not if you &apos;re looking for japanese adult film star ,
handsome los angeles .
born in february of 1937 ?
handsome , tell me your secrets .
looks like you are figuring that out .
so i &apos;m gonna go anywhere else .
hey , jess .
hi . hey , reagan .
wow , you were in here .
i was , yeah .
anybody else back there ?
if there was , i &apos;d be terrified .
it &apos;s a small space .
so you and jess are just talking .
i can only imagine what you guys are talking about .
well ... i can &apos;t stand it for another second .
i have to address the 800 @-@ pound gorilla that &apos;s in this room .
it &apos;s elephant in the room .
800 @-@ pound gorilla is a different thing .
okay , i guess i have to address the 800 @-@ pound elephant
that &apos;s in the middle of the room .
it &apos;s just elephant . the 800 pounds ,
that goes with the gorilla thing .
800 pounds is not a very big elephant .
jess ! reagan and i were romantic together .
i didn &apos;t know that .
which means i &apos;ve been romantic with both of you .
cool .
and it &apos;s not just because you have brown hair
and you &apos;ve shared this room .
but because you &apos;re great , top @-@ shelf ladies .
and i had the opportunity , and so i reached in the cookie jar ,
and i grabbed a chocolate chip and an oatmeal .
and i &apos;m not saying who &apos;s who .
i &apos;ve gotten off @-@ track .
your worlds must be turned
absolutely upside down .
this must be devastating , as it is to me .
we &apos;re all feeling emotions we couldn &apos;t even begin to discuss .
a lot of us are having bad anxiety ,
and our legs are feeling weird and tingly .
i think we &apos;re fine with it .
i think it &apos;s great .
i &apos;m really glad i came in here
and , uh , talked about this .
i feel like we &apos;ve gotten a lot of ... great .
well ...
winston !
i didn &apos;t hear winston .
he just screamed my name .
he needs help .
all right , i &apos;m coming to save you .
that &apos;s the most embarrassed i &apos;ve ever been
for anyone not doing improv .
he &apos;s being so weird .
i gotta get out of here for the day .
well , how would you like to drive around los angeles
and look for a juror ?
thank you for being reagan
travel to the car
and find a juror
your heart is true , but you &apos;re not walking fast enough .
you and nick , tell me everything .
the power went out .
we went into the basement .
there were rats , he passed out , we kissed .
oh , my god .
and you like him .
no . no , i don &apos;t .
we just hooked up a few times .
let &apos;s focus on you .
here &apos;s a courtroom sketch .
yep , there he is , 237b .
god , he can dress .
but we &apos;re gonna need more than that .
we need something distinctive , so did he have like a ...
he walked with a limp or he had a hook hand
or a neck tattoo-- anything ?
no .
he was perfect .
we all were .
except for the guy sitting next to him ,
9c-- ugh .
what was wrong with him ?
he never got why bunt v. che was a relevant precedent .
also he wheezed ... a lot .
like the door of a haunted house .
he has asthma .
we can find that guy
and see if he knows anything .
i used to peddle inhalers . what color was his ?
oh , uh ... red .
like the door of a haunted house !
sorry .
the only group excursion
we took was to a haunted house .
by the way , if you like haunted houses
but hate lines , january &apos;s a great time to go--
dr. foley ?
reagan lucas .
i was just calling to ask you if you were still
handing out samples of ciliabreez ?
six months after the recall ?
oh , dang .
jim ?
nothing more bad @-@ ass
than calling a doctor by his first name .
sorry .
all i need from you is the name of a patient .
what is this , winston ?
who are all these unusual people ?
where &apos;s the instructor ?
it is a gathering , not a class .
i &apos;ve told you that before .
listen , it &apos;s fun .
that &apos;s not dancing . these people aren &apos;t dancing .
dancing is about precision
and domination and sweat .
check out my ass . check out my ass !
my butt is alive !
we &apos;re not gonna learn our first dance here .
i &apos;m gonna call my beijing opening ceremonies contact .
he &apos;s fantastic .
no , no , no .
look , i always imagined that our first dance
would just be you and me having the time of our lives .
very choreographed time of our lives .
no .
having fun-- that &apos;s how i want to start our lives together .
can you please just try ? please ?
yeah , i &apos;ll @-@ i &apos;ll @-@ i &apos;ll try .
just listen to the music .
let it build . let it build .
got to let it wash over you-- oh , there &apos;s the wave !
let it wash over me on the three count ?
yes !
i think so .
it &apos;s happening . it &apos;s happening .
well , just teach me the steps and i &apos;d be happy to join in .
there are no steps .
what dance are you guys doing ?
because it is not humpty &apos;s !
this is his dance , y &apos;all !
and humpty hump is his name !
during cece &apos;s first wedding ,
nick and i went into a duct
to catch a badger that winston had released .
naturally .
it was crazy !
it was chaotic !
it was largely nick &apos;s fault .
but then i realized he &apos;s the only person
i &apos;d ever go into a duct with .
nick kind of sneaks up on you .
you think he &apos;s one thing ...
and then ...
yeah , nick is great .
but i &apos;m leaving and
we &apos;re both cool about that so--
oh , right , you &apos;re both totally cool about it .
i get goosebumps walka-- okay , okay , just think-- okay .
oh , wait , reagan , before you go !
&quot; wherever the fridge of life takes you ... &quot;
you came in , i liked you , then you left !
what , what is that ... ? !
stop thinking ...
that this is good @-@ bye .
and start knowing it as ...
bye ...
bye .
pretend i didn &apos;t do the &quot; byes . &quot;
so , dr. foley says our guy spends all of his time here .
with all this grass , no wonder his asthma is bad .
there he is !
hey , 9c !
oh , no . no , no , no , no , no !
you do not run my life anymore . good @-@ bye !
is that adult man afraid of you ?
i take a bathroom break when i want to !
i cracked skulls as foreman .
严禁吸烟
&quot; men only &quot; ? !
it &apos;s 2016 !
clearly , i make the rules .
that &apos;s why my office is a hut .
fine , we &apos;ll get a man .
so , winston didn &apos;t answer .
schmidt said , &quot; they &apos;re desecrating the time warp .
desecrating it ! &quot; and he hung up .
but i got a hold of nick .
he said that he &apos;s super busy ,
which means he &apos;s naked and doodling .
but he said he &apos;d make time for us , which is good .
wait , sorry , so nick is coming ?
yeah .
no , just call him and tell him not to come .
i thought you were cool .
i am cool .
you don &apos;t really seem cool .
it &apos;s just that when i see him , it &apos;s a , it &apos;s weird ,
mm @-@ hmm . &apos; cause i &apos;m , i &apos;m leaving
and it &apos;s , it &apos;s complicated .
i do-- i just , i don &apos;t really know how to ...
right .
god , i &apos;m crazy about him !
yes ! i knew it !
i knew it .
okay , yes .
that &apos;s enough . you &apos;re right .
you know what happens now .
i don &apos;t want to hug you .
you know what happens now !
i &apos;m not hugging you .
yeah , you are .
i &apos;m not hugging you .
you know the juror &apos;s name ?
i think it was 237b .
what &apos;s that guy &apos;s name , yeah ?
oh , yeah , no .
i really , really can &apos;t . it &apos;s like ... nah ...
i like that guy , really ?
what &apos;s the name of the juror ?
no !
calls hand sanitizer &quot; ham sanitizer . &quot;
tell me the name and i &apos;ll give you the hat !
quit it ! quit it !
he calls dna &quot; d and a. &quot;
you want grass stain on this white hat ? !
please no .
but he kisses you like a coal miner greeting his wife .
after a day in the caves .
did they go into caves ?
237b is gary garcia !
gary ?
i &apos;m not jumping this ! let &apos;s go !
you get back here !
gary garcia !
look at her out there .
treating the laws of music
as mere suggestions of music .
must be frightening to love a daredevil .
what happened to you ?
growing up a husky boy ,
i learned that i had no margin for error .
hey , fatty , it &apos;s called &quot; the hustle . &quot;
the slightest mistake meant ridicule ,
so i had to learn to do everything perfectly .
i learned to dance a dance the way
that it was meant to be danced .
and until i learned to dance
that dance perfectly , i would never dance that dance .
and then exactly 364 days later ...
do the hustle !
do the hustle ...
sock it , man !
go !
no complaints here , fatty .
no complaints .
let me ask you a question about this mean kid
at the talent show-- was he a child emperor ?
no , he was as poor and trashy as they come .
so he had no power over you then or now .
schmidt ,
you got to stop letting childish ridicule dictate your actions .
oh , yeah , well , your @-@ your smelly butt looks dumb in those pants .
hello ?
winston , i need you
to run a name through the system .
that &apos;s a real thing , right ?
yeah , nice vest !
hey , look , bishop altered his uniform again .
poor guy .
it &apos;s a bloodbath .
he &apos;ll live . come here , come here , come here .
come here !
so , here &apos;s my plan .
i knock on reagan &apos;s door and the moment
before she says good @-@ bye ,
i give her the goosebumps walkaway of your choosing ,
and then i walk away .
what direction ?
what direction ? do i , uh-- ?
do you go left , right or backwards ?
left , le ... uh , left !
nick .
uh , right , right .
backwards .
left is a great choice .
&apos;cause that &apos;s what i started with .
left is a great choice .
thank you , man .
that &apos;s , that was my instinct , left .
and i would read that one .
that &apos;s &apos; cause this is a perfect one .
when are you gonna tell him how you feel ?
never . i &apos;m still leaving .
what would be the point of telling him how i feel
when nothing can possibly come from it ?
so ...
there are 28 guys named gary garcia .
great , i can do that .
that &apos;s not bad . really ?
on that piece of paper .
931 in the system ; still printing .
are you sure that gary didn &apos;t have
something distinctive about him ?
just a smile big and wide ,
like the door of a haunted house .
boy , was i wrong . gary garcia .
in my mind , he was lawrence from torrance .
in your wildest fantasies , he lives in torrance ?
lawrence from torrance , not lawrence of torrance .
he was born in torrance ,
but now he lives in brentwood .
lawrence of brentwood .
kind of sounds like the sponsor at the end of a game show .
yeah . &quot; pat sajak &apos;s wardrobe
furnished by lawrence of brentwood . &quot;
yeah .
this is why you should tell nick how you feel .
even if nothing comes of it .
so you won &apos;t end up like me .
i never told gary how i feel ,
and now i never can .
you can , and you should .
don &apos;t let miller become your garcia .
hi , nick .
i want to say something to you before we say good @-@ bye .
sayonara , sammy .
sayonara .
what ?
that &apos;s the shower .
i know it is .
hello and good morning . hello and good morning .
you okay ?
it &apos;s not so bad
if i don &apos;t think about the trial .
trial , trial , trial , trial ...
hello and good morning !
today , more on that trial
that &apos;s been captivating los angeles .
joining us is the trial &apos;s foreman .
thank you for being here , ma &apos;am .
thank you for having me , alan ; i &apos;m a big fan .
also with us , via satellite ,
is another member of the jury .
no way it &apos;s him ! - whoa ...
what are the odds ?
well , exactly one in 11 , nick .
juror ...

historicbrentwood.info.
gary of brentwood .

all right , man .
i &apos;m gonna take off .
i gotta head to the station before my dance gathering .
you can &apos;t go to the station like that . they &apos;ll make fun of you .
when are you gonna stop worrying about what people say ?
when i look into my suggestion box ,
it is full .
people have a lot to say about the way i live my life .
but there is only one comment card
that i pay attention to .
and you know what that card says ?
it says , &quot; great job .
keep it up . &quot;
and you know who filled out that card ?
me .
you know how i know ?
because i recognize my motherfreakin &apos; handwriting .
now that &apos;s a goosebumps walkaway .
i can do this .
right ?
yes , i can do this .
oh , what ...
hey , i was just about to call you .
nick , look , there &apos;s something
that i wish i would &apos;ve said to you last night , but i didn &apos;t ,
so i &apos;m gonna say it right now .
sayonara , sammy .
those are such beautiful words .
i &apos;m sammy .
hello ?
reagan ...
i &apos;m gonna need some time to process
everything you just said .
yeah , i really put myself out there .
i ... hey ...
in light of recent events ,
i think it &apos;s important
that we have each other &apos;s current information .
i mean , i know i have your phone number
because i just dialed it
and i have your address because i lived there .
&apos;cause jess said it on tv .
i &apos;ve got a flight to catch .

totally . yeah .
like , any ... thing .
any thing at all .
yes .
gah ! what are you doing here ?
well , it &apos;s been six weeks since we &apos;ve talked
and i was ready to talk .
you and gary looked great on television .
well , that &apos;s how i want you to remember us :
blurry and talking like zuul .
well , then , mission accomplished ?
hey , did reagan say anything to you ?
yeah , she actually did .
she said , uh , &quot; sayonara , sammy . &quot;
does that mean anything ?
no , but whatever it means
will factor heavily into tonight &apos;s nick @-@ on @-@ nick time .
i don &apos;t want to know .
what nick @-@ on @-@ nick time is .
masturbating .
way more inf than i wanted .
everybody does it three or four times a day .
three or four times ...
i &apos;m talking about masturbating .
but never am i fully into it physically .
what ?
i missed you , kid .
missed you , too .
god , your nose hairs have gone totally bananas .
i &apos;m gonna get my scissors .
cece ,
i &apos;d like to show you something
that i have not been working on .
i will not .
you do the hustle , you stupid bossy song .

oh , it &apos;s the best time of my life !
