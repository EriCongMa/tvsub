so there &apos;s this bird--
some sort of swallow , i think .
where are we with avery ?
holding offers from usc . ,
penn , tulane and emory .
tulane and emory are in love . they want him bad .
every september , thousands of &apos; em ditch rainy seattle
to winter in mexico .
grey ?
these birds aren &apos;t dumb .
uh , still between boston and seattle .
if i &apos;m gonna lose one of my talented residents
and my top neurosurgeon ,
i &apos;d love a decision sooner than later .
you and me both , hunt .
yang ?
well , she didn &apos;t tell you ?
uh , stanford and columbia are playing hardball ,
but i &apos;m confident that we &apos;re still in the mix .
and every year , crowds of people gather around seattle
to drink beer and watch the flocks take off .
lee , steinman , and renaldo ?
offer from rice .
leaning toward wash u.
baylor and san diego are both after him .
they call it the great migration .

so let &apos;s get answers from our people as soon as possible .
thank you .
and let &apos;s not forget that we &apos;ve agreed to assist
boise memorial with their conjoined twin surgery ,
so make sure your teams are ready to leave from the lobby
no later than 10 : 00 tomorrow night .
you should be proud .
you trained these kids well .
you should be proud . you trained &apos; em .
yeah .
i sure did .
we passed our boards !
we killed the boards !
i just think it &apos;s weird
that we &apos;re not even talking about it ,
you know , things are unresolved here .
we &apos;re still friends .
it &apos;s all good , jackman .
i love this song !
excuse me .
kepner &apos;s wasted . that &apos;s a first .
yeah , well , lately she &apos;s been all about ...
firsts .

thank you so much for calling .
mayo wants to give me a research lab .

u.v.a. wants a board @-@ certified surgeon

music ! come on !
cristina ?
what are you doing ?
i don &apos;t know .
are you drunk ?
i don &apos;t know .
we got one whole day .
tuck &apos;s with his dad . i think we should make the most of it--
sargent exhibit at the art museum ,
pike place ,
maybe watch the sunset over the water .
12 whole hours to get to know the city that you have lived in
for the past ten years but still have yet to s--
no . no , no , no , no , no . you are supposed to be naked .
okay , well , the--the hospital just called .
a @-@ a stomach perf with intestinal obstruction
and an enlarged liver .
they don &apos;t know what &apos;s causing it .
uh , uh , could be fun . you want to come ?
so how much longer do i have ?
don &apos;t tiptoe around . just give it to me straight .
jake , you &apos;re not dying . he can be a little neurotic .
uh , we &apos;re hoping we &apos;ll be able to figure out more
during your surgery .
well , do you think it &apos;s something
that i @-@ i picked up abroad , like ebola or something ?
we were just on our honeymoon .
you two just got married ?
you seem like you &apos;ve been together a while .
it &apos;s our third in 12 years honeymoon .
we went to kauai the first time .
oh , beautiful .
yeah , then we got divorced .
then we went to fiji the next time .
the beaches .
yeah , and then we got divorced .
this time , my bride ,
she insisted on thailand .
we just can &apos;t seem to stay way from each other .
con-- congratulations .
so this patch here is your tumor .
it &apos;s invading the wall of your right ventricle .
what we &apos;ll do is , uh , we &apos;ll resect the tumor ,
then repair the ventricle ,
and replace the tricuspid valve .
dr. yang is the best that we have .
y @-@ you couldn &apos;t be in better hands .
come on .
where is she ?
arizona ? she &apos;s , um ...
patients .
so ... so many patients .
so , um , basically ,
you all want to chop up my heart into a jigsaw puzzle .
it may give me a few more months ,
most of which , i &apos;ll be spending in a hospital bed ,
while my best friend in the world
does everything possible to avoid me ?
or i spend the rest of my short life
lying on a sandy beach in belize .
nick , you need this surgery--
tell scottsdale i said good @-@ bye .
looks like i won &apos;t get the chance .
hunt needs to know where we are on boston ,
and i gotta let harvard know
what i &apos;m doing by the end of the day .
we &apos;re not going . anything else you need to know ?
you know , i may have told you , i have family on the east coast .
a couple of times .
and i may have replied that my sister lives here .
and if cristina chooses stanford ,
it &apos;s a 2 @-@ hour plane ride .
but if she chooses columbia ,
it &apos;s only a 2 @-@ hour train ride .
we &apos;re not going .
they want me to run
the entire neurosurgery department at harvard .
webber loves me , and bailey loves me .
i will be teaching the best fellows in the world .
we are staying .
we &apos;re leaving .
here you go , apes .
i was thinking i could take the trauma rooms ,
and , uh , we could split the beds .
i can handle trauma , alex .
it was one phone call .
it doesn &apos;t mean i can &apos;t practice medicine .
i still have three great hospitals who want me .
of course they do , apes .
don &apos;t call me apes .
karev , come here .
you &apos;re gonna get a phone call in a few minutes ,
and not just any phone call .
it &apos;s from keith collier .
i don &apos;t know any keith colliers .
he was one of your examiners at the boards .
oh , crap . i failed , didn &apos;t i ?
they changed their minds . son of a--
karev , karev ,
keith is a good friend of mine .
now whatever you told him at the boards
really impressed him .
i mean , really impressed him .
he wants to offer you a peds surgery fellowship
at hopkins .
hopkins has the best program in the country .
they &apos;ve already chosen their fellows for next year .
which is what makes this so extraordinary .
they &apos;re adding a position just for karev .
this is you playing some kind of practical joke ,
then at the end , you &apos;re gonna tell me i learned something
when i really haven &apos;t .
i @-@ i am not joking .
i have no skin in this game .
hopkins is the dream .
i know .
it &apos;s really not cool to screw with somebody &apos;s head like this .
you know that .
i know .
make sure your ringer &apos;s on .
he &apos;s full of crap .
i don &apos;t think so .
i &apos;m over this .
cristina , i made a decision .
oh , you have ?
you &apos;re going to stanford .
oh , you &apos;ve made my decision .
there &apos;s no way you &apos;re going to columbia .
and mayo &apos;s in minnesota . please .
和斯坦福所在的加州都很远
and since we &apos;re staying here ,
stanford &apos;s only a couple of hours away .
you &apos;ll come up . i &apos;ll bring zola down .
we can get drunk on the weekends .
okay , well , maybe i shouldn &apos;t bring zola .
hey ! there you are .
is there anything you want to go over on the conjoined twins
before you head out to boise ?
no . i &apos;m ... i &apos;m good .
you sure ? &apos; cause you &apos;re gonna be
the sole cardiothoracic surgeon representing seattle grace .
which , i mean , you know , is kind of unheard of
for an attending to allow her fellow to do .
but that &apos;s just the kind of faith i have in you .
technically , i &apos;m not a fellow yet .
i know . right ?
i mean , so just think about all the things
that you &apos;re gonna be able to do when you are .
tip of the iceberg , yang . i &apos;m proud of you .
you haven &apos;t even told her you &apos;re leaving ?
i haven &apos;t decided yet where i &apos;m going .
you just did .
stanford .
hopkins !
hopkins is not in the running .
not for you . for me . hopkins .
hopkins wants me .
hopkins wants me .
johns hopkins , the hospital ?
alex , how ?
not hopkins refrigeration school ?
i kinda bitched out their chief of surgery , at my boards ,
and i ... i ... i guess he was impressed .
so they know you &apos;re a jerk ?
they totally know ,
and they want me .
hopkins wants me .
i &apos;m not surprised at all .
i am 100 % surprised .
nice work , evil spawn .
yes !
hopkins !
the stomach &apos;s adhered to the bowel ,
and look at the size of this liver .
you know , this is one for the record book .
we should be taking pictures .
oh , we really should .
sure . let &apos;s take a break .
wait for someone could find a camera .
we got all the time in the world .
we do have all the time in the world .
this is my only case today .
because it &apos;s your day off .
i &apos;ll have another day off .
i made a lunch reservation .
i even brought the crossword .
we could skip the crossword for one week .
that &apos;s not right .
what in the name of chickens is going on here ?
is it crohn &apos;s disease ?
maybe it &apos;s just a mystery .
maybe lee harvey oswald &apos;s magic bullet &apos;s been dancing around
in mr. steiner &apos;s intestines for 50 years .
sometimes we just never figure it out .
you marvel at the wonder of it all while you sew &apos; em up ,
and you go eat lunch .
is it a metabolic syndrome ?
oh , maybe it &apos;s autoimmune .
what did you tell keith ?
finish up .
yes , sir .
i told him i needed a day or two to think about it .
you know , i made a commitment to robbins .
i don &apos;t know what i &apos;m doing here .
i &apos;m freaking out .
what &apos;s hopkins giving salary @-@ wise ?
it &apos;s competitive .
they throw in a loan @-@ repayment package , moving expenses ?
you did the whole africa thing .
tell me you at least asked for an international rotation .
oh , karev .
look , it &apos;s not like i have any leverage .
and these are two of the best programs in the country .
who both want you .
and now &apos;s the time to shake &apos; em down .
i mean , pit &apos; em against each other .
you call hopkins back and tell &apos; em what you want ,
and then get hunt &apos;s ass down here
and give him the same demands .
what if he doesn &apos;t want to play ball ?
i mean , if he doesn &apos;t have the money ,
he doesn &apos;t have the money .
oh , he has the money .
and when he lies and says that he doesn &apos;t have the money ,
and he will lie ...
you &apos;re not doing your job as the chief if you don &apos;t lie ...
you tell him you know about his incidentals and overhead fund .
incidentals and overhead fund .
exactly .
you say those four little words ,
and i promise ...
the kingdom will be yours .
how &apos;s julia ? you impregnate her yet ?
no , i was all ready to , but then lexie ...
she told me she was in love with me .
what did you say ?
i said , &quot; thank you for your candor . &quot;
&quot; thank you for your candor &quot; ?
what was i supposed to do ?
oh , i don &apos;t know ... kiss her .
julia &apos;s away on a conference . i &apos;m not a cheater .
usually .
look , i owe it to the both of them to ...
i don &apos;t want to mess this one up , okay ?
julia wants to give me everything i want .
but i &apos;m in love with lexie , who doesn &apos;t want anything i want .
dr. shepherd .
dr. sloan .
lexie , come on in .
oh , uh ...
plenty of room .
you know , actually , i was just gonna update you
on the boise doctors &apos; bios , but since you &apos;re both here ,
i &apos;m just gonna give it to you , and then that way , i can ...
leave .
oh , uh , no . oh , sorry . you guys go . i &apos;m gonna stay .
oh , hey , lexie , about that other thing ,
don &apos;t think i forgot what you said .
i just need to ruminate on that ... ah .
you know ? run it up the old flagpole ?
okay .
you know , it &apos;s too bad meredith and i are moving to boston .
i &apos;m gonna miss this .
hey , you got a second ?
&apos;cause i cannot figure out what to do about tulane ,
and there &apos;s this whole other thing
that happened at the boards .
i mean , it &apos;s all kinda thrown me for a loop .
aw . look at that . she &apos;s cute .
must be nice in here with all these cute little babies .
yeah .
is she dying , like , right now ?
&apos;cause nick is .
remember nick , your brother &apos;s best friend ,
your rock , who is right now packing up
and bailing on a surgery that he needs to live
because you can &apos;t get your stubborn head out of your ass
and let go of the fact that he didn &apos;t come to you sooner ?
callie , i--
no , i @-@ i don &apos;t get it .
you watch babies die every day .
when things looked bad for me , you didn &apos;t leave my side .
and now your best friend &apos;s asking for you .
look , you need to get your crap together
before he leaves ,
because if he goes now , he is gone .
she &apos;s not actually dying , is she ?
no .
okay , good .
you said you &apos;d know more once you got in there .
we hoped we &apos;d know more .
unfortunately , we weren &apos;t able to find the cause .
but the good news is , we were able to repair
all the damage to your abdomen .
well , what &apos;s the point if you don &apos;t know what &apos;s doing it ?
something is eating my insides .
maybe it &apos;s stress , you know ?
you &apos;re so worried about the worst @-@ case scenario ,
you finally made it happen .
okay , coral can poison you . that &apos;s a known fact .
and look at you . i told you not to pet those monkeys .
what ? it &apos;s a rash . it &apos;s not from the monkeys .
would you please take a look at her arm ?
it &apos;s been there for weeks .
let me see . uh , where did you say you honeymooned again ?
thailand .
you know , where pigs walk around inside restaurants .
it &apos;s called local color .
it &apos;s unsanitary .
life is unsanitary .
that &apos;s what makes it fun , for god sakes .
mrs. steiner , please hold still .
oh , what is this here ?
is that--
right there--
that &apos;s ...
a worm .
good news .
i think we found what &apos;s eating your insides .
the nasty critter ?
raw fish ?
sushi in thailand from a train station .
i &apos;m looking for more damage . want to help ?
no . i &apos;m gonna cancel our lunch reservation .
oh , are you really still moping about lunch ?
i had a plan .
we had a day .
ben , there is a gnathostoma worm
in this man &apos;s body .
these things eat through the viscera ,
migrate through the tissue .
this is a once @-@ in @-@ a @-@ lifetime parasite .
i &apos;m sorry if i find it
a little more interesting right now
than the crossword and garden salad .
the patient is on antiparasitics .
the worm is going to die .
wh-- there &apos;s nothing else you can do right now
other than go to lunch .
this is not like one of your movies
where--where--where the larvae gestate in the brain ,
leaving the poor host a hollowed @-@ out zombie
whose bite will now infect the whole populous on the base .
what movie is that ?
what ?
no , that sounds good . i haven &apos;t seen it .
i made it up .
oh , man !
okay , let &apos;s see now . there &apos;s ...
man .
you made a commitment .
technically , that was a verbal agreement .
i never signed a contract .
i would like to think that your word is as good as a contract .
n @-@ n @-@ normally , yeah .
but ... this is hopkins .
i just think you should know what they &apos;re offering me .
oh , really , like what ?
like , uh , m @-@ moving expenses .
you live here .
true .
but this is the extra dough
that hopkins was willing to offer .
i &apos;m just asking you to add that on to my new salary .
karev ,
even if i wanted to , i couldn &apos;t .
that budget is already set .
we don &apos;t have the dough . okay ?
maybe you should recheck that budget .
you know , see what you got lying around in your ...
incidentals and overhead fund .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
oh , i @-@ i think you do .
oh , we can add spaghetti wednesday
to the list of things i &apos;m not gonna miss about this place .
are you kidding ? best deal in town .
i &apos;ve watched alex go through six bowls already .
true that .
hey , i hear stanford has a farm @-@ to @-@ table chef .
you can text your order right from the o.r.
well , i &apos;ll factor that in . i still haven &apos;t made my decision .
well , it &apos;s gotta be stanford . where else would you go ?
i don &apos;t know . i might stay .
everything &apos;s on the table .
she likes the spaghetti , too .
tulane &apos;s got crawfish .
i mean , that &apos;s a selling point .
u.s.c. , i mean , what-- what do they eat in l.a. ?
souls .
2 @-@ 1 @-@ 2 . it &apos;s new york .
mount sinai .
answer it .
bad news is only bad news if you pick up the phone .
april kepner speaking .
cristina .
oh , really ?
okay .
okay .
oh , my gosh . okay .
no , no , no , no .
no , thank you .
they--they didn &apos;t pull my offer ?
oh , no . they did .
i just figured that &apos;s what you &apos;d sound like
in the face of rejection .
hey , you want my fries , apes ?
not if they &apos;re pity fries .
i tasted the sample .
no , you still got case western and seattle , right ?
you &apos;re gonna be ... fine .
so what does sloan think about tulane ?
he hasn &apos;t weighed in one way or the other .
there &apos;s something wrong with him .
i think he &apos;s disturbed or something .
then again , i &apos;ve been pretty disturbed myself these days .
2 @-@ 1 @-@ 6 .
cleveland .
maybe case western &apos;s offering loan assistance .
this is kepner .
oh , yeah ?
well , you know what ? i am an awesome surgeon .
and i would &apos;ve rocked your stupid little program
so it is your loss . go to hell !
where are you going ?
belize .
you &apos;re going to have the surgery .
why , so i can get a few more months
of pain and suffering ?
so you can live , and then you &apos;ll have radiation ,
or we &apos;ll get you in a clinical trial .
oh , now you have an opinion , doctor ?
after you &apos;ve been m.i.a. for three days ?
i &apos;ve been a little busy , nick . i--
look , i get that this is scary for you .
i really do .
but it kinda sucks for me , too .
they &apos;re telling me i &apos;m riddled with cancer ,
and i &apos;m completely alone .
where &apos;s your sister ? did--did you call your sister ?
you &apos;re the one that &apos;s supposed to be here .
you &apos;re the one who &apos;s supposed to have my back through all this .
and you &apos;re nowhere ! you &apos;re gone !
i have your back !
then have it !
please ...
please ... have the surgery .
it &apos;ll work .
and i &apos;ll be here .
i &apos;ll be here .
i promise .
damn , phoenix .
things a guy has to do to get your attention .
i love the fireplace , the stonework .
you hated it a month ago .
and the windows .
these views are amazing . you are a genius .
i will build you a dream house in boston .
what will we do with this one ?
mark will buy it .
his dreams have always been my dreams .
harvard is offering me a $ 10 million endowment .
they &apos;re setting me up with an entire research team .
i &apos;m gonna cure alzheimer &apos;s , meredith .
that &apos;s my dream .
not this house .
you &apos;re making this choice with cristina .
she &apos;s not the only factor .
i &apos;m your husband .
you should make it with me .
so i didn &apos;t see any further damage
from the parasite on your scans .
that &apos;s great , but you can &apos;t just
leave a worm inside of him forever .
this thing has teeth . you have to get it out of me , please .
you know , i have a worm inside of me , too ,
but you don &apos;t hear me crying about it .
yours is in your arm , and they &apos;re taking it out today .
mine could be anywhere .
oh , my god . my penis .
it &apos;s not gonna get to your -- it doesn &apos;t do that , does it ?
my legs .
okay , well , which is it your legs or your penis ?
no , i &apos;m serious . i can &apos;t feel my legs or my arms .
it &apos;s -- it &apos;s weird . it &apos;s all going numb .
what ?
can you move your toes ?
what about your fingers ?
no .
shoot .
okay .
can you feel that ?
barely .
what &apos;s wrong ? what &apos;s happening to him ?
page shepherd .
right away , doctor .
well , the thing &apos;s gnawed through all the discs .
c @-@ 3 to c @-@ 5 are all inflamed .
so it &apos;s in there .
the worm &apos;s in his cervical spine ,
nesting , waiting .
so there &apos;s a chance of paralysis .
complete paralysis . i need to get in there quick .
otherwise , he &apos;s gonna be a quadriplegic .
go . i &apos;m going in with you . i &apos;m on your six .
i &apos;ll get him prepped . lock and load , people .
she &apos;s on your what ?
i have no idea .
okay , dealer &apos;s choice .
do you want to do the ventriculoplasty
or resect the tumor
or ...
do you want to be primary surgeon ?
fine .
fine ?
okay , what is going on ?
are you staying ? are you going ?
&apos;cause it @-@ it &apos;s driving me crazy . i @-@ i don &apos;t ...
if it has to do with owen , whatever it is ,
i am sure the two of you can fix it .
i &apos;ll take all of it .
what ? all of it --
the ventriculoplasty
and as much of the tumor as you &apos;ll let me do .
thank you . it &apos;s very generous .
i &apos;ll see you in there .
okay , marion ,
the ultrasound shows
the worm went deeper into your tissue
but we should still be able to get that nasty thing out .
jake could die
or he could be in a wheelchair for the rest of his life .
i &apos;m the one that insisted we go to thailand .
i keep trying to turn him into somebody else .
maybe we made a mistake .
what do you mean exactly ?
how do you know it was a mistake ?
i don &apos;t know why we keep coming back to each other .
we &apos;re the same people ,
but we keep expecting a different outcome .
isn &apos;t that the definition of insanity ?
or love .
if there &apos;s a spark , there &apos;s a spark .
or maybe you think there &apos;s a spark ,
but it just happened once , so you can &apos;t really tell ,
and there &apos;s no time to actually figure that out
because you &apos;re probably moving halfway across the country .
are we gonna get this worm out any time soon ?
yeah . get the irrigation ready .
right . on it .
c @-@ 3 and c @-@ 4 are just a mess .
i &apos;m gonna have to go further in here than i expected .
you might as well go all the way to c @-@ 5 .
i mean , from the look of this lesion ,
that &apos;s where the bastard set up his hive .
i don &apos;t want it to be any more invasive
than it has to be .
don &apos;t argue with her .
she &apos;s starring in her own sci @-@ fi movie .
you mess with her , she &apos;ll pull out her ray gun
and atomize your ass .
and he &apos;s still pouting . you &apos;re a physician .
is this really the first time you missed a lunch
and the crossword because of a surgery ?
here we go .
it was important to me .
well , this parasite &apos;s important to me .
yeah , i can see that .
you know what ?
fine . let &apos;s do it right now . give me the damn crossword .
just forget it .
oh , no . nobody &apos;s ever gonna forget it .
where is dr. warren &apos;s bag ?
miranda ...
oh , there it is .
and this is why you don &apos;t work with your girlfriend .
i warned them .
here we go . oh , this is gonna be so great .
it &apos;s way better than a once @-@ in @-@ a @-@ lifetime ,
bone @-@ eating parasite .
let &apos;s see . one down .
dr. bailey--
oh , no , no , no .
no help from you . i &apos;m too excited .
this is what i live for .
let &apos;s see &quot; peruvian mountain range . &quot;
oh , andes . five , uh @-@ huh .
&quot; planet with water , four letters . &quot;
oh , mars . duh . uh , &quot; fancy sauce &quot; ?
fancy ... ooh .
remoulade .
stop .
what ? no , no . i &apos;m on a roll . come on .
hey , this can &apos;t be the sunday , &apos; cause this is way too easy .
what &apos;s--oh , hey , this one , 21 across .
&quot; my question to you . &quot; hmm .
i &apos;m asking you to put it away .
he &apos;s asking you nicely , dr. bailey .
oh , no , no , no . when he doesn &apos;t get his way ,
he holds on to it in his cheek like a squirrel with a nut .
we are doing the crossword .
what is &quot; my question to you &quot; ?
it &apos;s a bunch of letters .
um ... oh , maybe it &apos;s a phrase .
&quot; my question to you , &quot; anybody ?
how many letters ?
uh , 2 ... 9 ... 13 .
it &apos;s 13 letters ?
14 .
no , i &apos;m looking at it . it &apos;s 13 .
no , it &apos;s 14 . count again .
i just counted .
what , do you have x @-@ ray vision from across the room ?
&quot; will you marry me &quot;
is my question to you .
and the reason why it &apos;s so easy
is because i made the crossword .
took me two damn months
not to mention getting a mockup made of &lt; i &gt; the new york times . &lt; / i &gt;
the phrase has 14 letters .
&quot; will , &quot; four , &quot; you , &quot; seven ,
&quot; marry , &quot; 12 , &quot; me ... &quot;
14 .
got it .
it was in c @-@ 4 .
all right , temp &apos;s down to 30 degrees .
cross @-@ clamping the aorta .
all right . let &apos;s see what we &apos;re working with .
damn it .
this wasn &apos;t in the scans .
the tumor &apos;s infiltrated much deeper into the ventricle .
reconstructive ventriculoplasty
isn &apos;t gonna cut it .
we could do a fontan ?
directly sew the right atrium to the pulmonary artery .
we could patch whatever &apos;s left .
that would help with blood flow ,
but the hole in the resection would--
yeah . he--he &apos;d arrest right on the table .
we could do an r.v. to a p.a. conduit--
no , the thing would calcify . it would kill him .
a cadaver homograft ?
uh , the hole would be way too big .
it &apos;s instant heart failure .
they don &apos;t know what to do , callie .
they have no idea .
no , it &apos;s--it &apos;s altman and yang , okay ?
they &apos;ll figure something out .
they &apos;re gonna figure something out .
come on , guys . come on .
hey .
sedona .

cancer free ?
the tumor had taken over your heart ,
and there was no good way to get it out so ...
they had to close up .
but i thought ...
you said it was my best shot .
it was .
so ...
i guess i &apos;m going to belize .
yeah .

short of offering her my own job .
i mean , i &apos;ve sang , i &apos;ve--i &apos;ve danced , i &apos;ve--
i slept with someone else .
so ...
there &apos;s nothing that you could &apos;ve done .
she &apos;s not leaving you .
she &apos;s leaving me .
i &apos;m sorry .
hopkins didn &apos;t pull the offer , did they ?
they , uh , gave me the international rotation
and the moving expenses ,
and they took care of , uh ,
all my loans-- college , med school .
they &apos;re even throwing in a mortgage allowance .
i could buy a house .
good .
they gave me everything i asked for .
so did hunt .
then ...
why the hell aren &apos;t you celebrating ?
no one &apos;s ever wanted me like this .
you just don &apos;t recognize the view , karev ...
the crowd going wild ,
people taking pictures ,
the snap of the tape as you break it .
what are you talking about ?
what it looks like when you finish first .
chief , you paged ?

you--you don &apos;t have to worry about that--
it &apos;s not just about the boards .
i &apos;ve had to do some last @-@ minute rejiggering of my budget ,
and i just don &apos;t have the money--
this is a top @-@ ranking hospital . there &apos;s always money .
i @-@ i @-@ i can help you find it .
i &apos;m really good with budgets .
chief ...
i have nothing left .
seattle grace was my last option .
you &apos;re not the best candidate
for the job anymore .
i am sorry .
they &apos;re conjoined at the sternum and the diaphragm .
it &apos;s tricky .
i can handle it .
so seattle &apos;s still in the mix .
that &apos;s a surprise .
because of owen ?
cristina , he should be with someone who wants a baby .
and you should be with someone who wants you .
you know what ?
you and everyone else needs to just ...
shut up about it .
it &apos;s a huge decision .

banging into windows ,
being eaten by cats .

i guess they come back to what they know .
people say it &apos;s pretty cool
watching them go .
they say you can actually see the moment ...
when , at some mysterious signal ...
all at once ...
the birds decide to leave .
so maybe i &apos;ve been missing out .
whatever .
