oh ! oh . good morn @-@ ing .
how did i spend my summer vacation ?
i got over my breakup with andy .
i got a job at grandpa &apos;s country club .
好发于青少年 具有传染性
i got mono .
too close !
put your mask on !
no one misses two weeks at caltech and catches up .
what am i gonna do ?
well , honey , i think you need to focus
on getting a little bit stronger ,
a little bit healthier and just a little farther .
how do nerds even get mono ?
did you all practice by kissing the same pillow ?
shouldn &apos;t you be at work by now ?
i got fired .
my plan was to hide it from my parents until i got a new job ,
but with smarty @-@ pants alex home ,
i had to be more careful , or she was going to figure it out .
her being super @-@ sick is coming at a really bad time for me .
you got in late last night , huh ?
yeah . it was payday ,
and a game of craps broke out in the kitchen .
see this watch ? enrique &apos;s grandfather &apos;s .
you &apos;re giving it back , and remember , the second that job
interferes with your grades , you &apos;re done .
did you finish your history report ?
just got to dot the i &apos;s and cross the t &apos;s ...
and put in all the other letters .
it &apos;s okay , everybody !
i &apos;m alive !
i had a traumatic experience after an open house .
have a good one .
oh , no .
monday lunch , monday dinner .
tuesday breakfast , tuesday lunch .
welcome home .
open house went great . lots of interested buyers .
fun fact -- some stranger , probably a long time ago ,
wrote their last will and testament right here on your wall .
trust me on this .
did nobody notice i was gone for 18 hours ?
why aren &apos;t you all making posters ?
i figured you were in your office .
i went to bed really early last night ,
and when i woke up this morning , i thought you &apos;d gone for a run .
alex ? i can &apos;t believe this !
well , honey , the important thing is that you are okay .
now , i &apos;m very sorry , but i &apos;ve got to get to work .
we are bidding a big job against my old nemesis ,
closets , closets , closets , closets .
i &apos;m back in there .
i want to live outside .
no , senor , we &apos;re not having that argument anymore .
mowgli lives outside .
is mowgli that dirty kid at his preschool
whose parents drive the car that runs on french fry oil ?
no . it &apos;s that dirty kid that runs around &quot; the jungle book . &quot;
jay , tell him he can &apos;t .
first time i saw &quot; tarzan , &quot; i wanted to live outside .
dad said fine . i walked in the woods , met a hobo .
taught me how to open a can with a bird &apos;s beak .
that story &apos;s not helping !
i &apos;m doing it .
no ! jay !
of course not .
why learn self @-@ reliance when the industrial machine
depends on constant consumption ?
no eggs for me . i &apos;ll be having porridge .
are you really still doing this ?
over the summer , i went to a wedding in ju · rez and met frida ,
this amazing girl who enlightened me
to how communism can rid the world of injustice .
mm . what a beautiful reception .
yeah .
oh , right . that &apos;s a bad thing .
i live simply now , and it &apos;s good for me .
might it also help my chance of kissing her one day ? yes .
and if that requires living in a world
where the government chooses all our songs , so be it .
i &apos;m gonna take a coffee
to the guy putting up the security cameras .
it &apos;s not coffee the laborers need , jay . it &apos;s dignity .
and i &apos;m going to fight for that
until my fingers are raw and my back is bent .
six months ago , we took you to the dermatologist
for taking too many bubble baths .
brought you this .
oh , thanks . almost done here .
take your time .
important thing is ...
oh , no .
guess what .
a black family &apos;s moving in right across the street
the same day my security cameras are going up .
well , what am i supposed to do ?
i made the appointment weeks ago
right after the break @-@ in down the street .
but they &apos;ll think i made the call the minute i saw them
because i &apos;m a racist old man .
why would the neighbors just assume that you &apos;re a racist ?
gloria , gloria , gloria .
you &apos;ll never understand the stereotypes old white men face .
goal !
nice shot , tom .
do you want to play with us ?
you know , i &apos;m off contact sports right now .
i twisted my ankle playing running charades ,
but you two should get ready for dance class .
okay , go . go , go , go !
okay , why do you look so satisfied ?
did you just listen to an npr story
that proved you right about something ?
no , no , but you know tom ,
the friend that lily &apos;s playing with ?
well , i know of him . we haven &apos;t formally been introduced .
well , it turns out that tom used to identify as ... tina .
oh , i wish you wouldn &apos;t have told me .
you know how proud i am of my gender identificadar .
well , tom &apos;s been having some problems at school ,
and -- and lily has been really respectful of him .
oh , she is so sweet .
she really is .
she gets all the credit on this one .
this so doesn &apos;t matter .
we raised her to have an open mind .
totally . we deserve some kudos here , too .
there &apos;s enough kudos for everyone .
you know , a kudo would be an excellent name for a parenting award .
oh , thank you , gwyneth .
lily , if you &apos;re still watching , go to bed .
get out of here , you weirdo !
part of being the boss is being a bummer .
it was hard at first , but i &apos;ve learned to accept it ...
mostly .
it &apos;s really been ...
margaret , you knew i was in here .
sorry . i just had some messages .
uh @-@ huh . luke &apos;s guidance counselor --
luke fell asleep in class again .
haley &apos;s car payment is late .
and the credit @-@ card company .
phil made a large purchase
on a tibetan website called copingcandles.com.
tell the creative team to get their giggles out .
i &apos;ll be ready for them in 10 .
but when you &apos;ve been the bummer all day at work ,
you don &apos;t love having to be the bummer at home , too .
hi , honey . is your brother around ? i need to yell at him .
of course he &apos;s around .
why would he leave me in peace
to do some work at the kitchen table
when he could just barge in and --
luke ! game down !
this is your senior year ,
also known as your last year to not suck .
honey .
dad , you hit &quot; place order &quot; once ,
and then you wait for the confirmation .
i &apos;m sorry .
don &apos;t be sorry ! be smart !
that angry screeching
was the sweet sound of my new home bummer .
i &apos;m just so tired and in pain and irritable .
it just makes me so mad at everyone .
sorry for yelling , mom . why were you calling again ?
i forgot .
damn it , mom ! write it down next time !
all right .
here we are .
okay . don &apos;t forget to give funkmaster linda her check
for today &apos;s class .
bye , tom .
bye , tom .
hey , lily . can you hang back a second ?
i shouldn &apos;t . linda says being late is wiggity @-@ wack .
we just want to know why you called tom a weirdo
back at the house .
i don &apos;t know .
okay , well , we don &apos;t make fun of people who are different , okay ?
you know how hard it was for daddy and me ?
yeah .
growing up in missouri , i was so mistreated
that one of my best friends was an old scarecrow
i found in the creek .
some of your stories would be more impactful
with fewer details .
fine . i won &apos;t do it again . can i go now ?
okay , but -- but do you understand why what you did is wrong ?
yes !
well , this bothers me .
they &apos;re getting along great , and then one little spat ,
and her instinct is to go all baby bigot on him ?
well -- and i say this with love --
she did just get back from spending a full summer
with your family in missouri .
oh . so we &apos;re blaming my family , then ?
i &apos;m -- i &apos;m just saying maybe when she gets back from there ,
she needs to be reminded of our values .
you know -- un @-@ hick her .
oh , the h @-@ bomb !
possibly the most offensive slur
ever thrown around in the south .
well ... y--
look , i @-@ i love those people , too ,
but you did just admit
they can be a little close @-@ minded down there .
well , they are a little bit set in their ways .
it was actually illegal to run for mayor without a mustache
until 1980 . - see ? it &apos;s --
and then again from &apos; 82 to &apos; 85 .
okay .
input .
input !
please don &apos;t throw the remote again .
oh , i was just , like , trying to get signal .
don &apos;t blame me about breaking the other ones .
one got stepped on ,
and the other one fell down the garbage disposal .
you &apos;re not even trying .
anyways , stop worrying about the remote control
and worry about your own dog .
she &apos;s peeing in the corner .
maybe if you ever leave her outside ,
she will guard us , and we wouldn &apos;t need cameras .
first of all , stella &apos;s not peeing in the corner ,
because i housebroke her myself .
second of all , no dog of mine should ever have to work .
there he is . there &apos;s my old pal .
jay . how you doing , huh ?
i &apos;m so glad you called .
i haven &apos;t been good about seeing people since reynetta left .
did you hear ? she started dating my brother !
listen , it &apos;s such a nice day . let &apos;s go outside .
isn &apos;t your backyard nicer ?
nah . it &apos;s all pool and chairs .
so , how you been , buddy ?
i want to tell you everything is okay so you won &apos;t worry ,
but things have been real bad .
you know what might help ?
you pop that hat off , you get a little sun on your face .
ooh ! the sun is rough on my eyes .
i cry almost every day .
pretty much , the only time i &apos;m happy is when i clean my gun .
yeah , life , huh ? here , give me a hug .
there you go . oh .
there you go . you &apos;re a good friend , jay .
you got your own problems , but you &apos;re right there for me .
damn it !
why do you need them to know you have a black friend ?
i &apos;m putting security cameras in the same day they move in .
i &apos;m mad about that , but it feels good to be held .
come here .
come here .
flashbacks , nightmares , anxiety --
my imprisonment in the closet
resulted in all the symptoms of ptsd .
my insurance company helped me to find a therapy dog
and agreed to cover everything ,
and then they found out i wasn &apos;t in the military .
oh , boy .
hey , alex , honey , could you help me reset the router ? !
oh ! no .
bad luck ! bad luck ! !
alex &apos;s laptop had every piece of homework
she ever did in high school .
it was the holy grail ...
i think .
thanks to alex &apos;s hard work ,
i don &apos;t know what that is and never will .
not again !
oh , dad , i didn &apos;t know you were home .
haley , thank god .
could you reset the router for me ?
i would , but i took a late lunch from work ,
which i have to get back to work .
are you okay ?
i &apos;m fine .
i think i &apos;m just hyperventilating .
should pass in like 20 minutes or s @-@ so .
okay , well , i &apos;m gonna head back .
wouldn &apos;t want to be consistently late
and get fired , right ?
alex , honey .
good girl .
good girl .
input ! i know you can hear me
because i can see your green light !
it &apos;s like one of those videos where the pit bull
swims with the baby chick .
you just know something bad &apos;s gonna happen .
where are your keys ? i need the jumper cables .
what happened ?
i spent the last hour in my car ,
listening to the commodores with my windows down ,
and the neighbors didn &apos;t even come outside .
that must be your good friends the harlem globetrotters .
hey .
hey !
gloria invited us to sit by the pool
till we have to pick up lily at hip @-@ hop .
my asian granddaughter takes a hip @-@ hop class ?
why are we not talking about this in the front yard ?
we brought cupcakes . manny , cupcake ?
oh , i see . fill my mouth with bourgie opiates
so i can &apos;t speak for the people ?
that was a lot .
he &apos;s trying to get a communist girl to kiss him .
we have our own kid problems .
i mean , we had an incident this afternoon
during lily &apos;s playdate with tom ,
who used to identify as ... tina .
i don &apos;t totally get the hand thing , but i like it .
they had a fight , and lily said the worst possible thing .
i mean , that poor boy &apos;s been through enough . mm .
oh , i am sure that the parents have gone through a lot , too .
sure . you just don &apos;t get comfortable
with something like that overnight .
let me ask you guys something .
if , someday , lily wanted to be lou
and had the whole chop @-@ chop , bing @-@ bang thing ,
how would you be with that ?
we love lily .
lou .
we love lou .
and there &apos;s nothing she could do -- - he .
he .
there &apos;s nothing he could do
that would change that .
so you wouldn &apos;t even need the minute that tom &apos;s parents did ?
well , no , no . maybe a minute .
i mean , there &apos;d @-@ there &apos;d be a lot of things that i &apos;d be giving up
that i &apos;ve always imagined doing ,
like -- like walking her down the aisle in her wedding dress .
you know ?
or whispering in her husband &apos;s ear
that he &apos;ll never replace me .
well , that &apos;s interesting , because the minute it took me
to accept the fact that my son
was living a different
kind of life than the one that i anticipated ,
mitchell called me an
old , straight , white bigot .
and now you &apos;re just like me .
oh , my god , mitchell . are we where lily gets it ?
are we not as open @-@ minded as we think ?
but that &apos;s our thing -- lording our tolerance over others .
i guess what this proves is ,
there &apos;s a little bit of prejudice in everyone --
you , me ,
the neighbor across the street judging me for my cameras .
i &apos;m gonna do what i should have done at the beginning --
talk to them .
that &apos;s not a good idea .
watch me !
joe , you &apos;re not going to live outside !
fine !
alex is never away from her laptop ,
so i had to steal assignments one at a time .
i &apos;m not proud of stealing ,
but i &apos;m not unproud of how i &apos;m stealing .
oh , honey , i &apos;m so sorry ,
but now that you &apos;re awake ,
what happened in here , huh ?
i &apos;ll tell you what happened here --
the same thing that &apos;s been happening all damn day !
me dealing with animals who don &apos;t care
that we are air @-@ conditioning the outside
and insist on rotting their brains by watching vapid housewives
spit wine on each other .
and you . can &apos;t even be bothered to use a plate !
oh , she &apos;s a bummer , huh ?
something funny ?
no .
what are you even doing home ?
don &apos;t you cat @-@ sit for your boss on tuesday nights ?
alex , maybe you &apos;d feel better if we went for a walk
or a ride in the car , huh ? go for a ride in the car !
you know what ? there are just too many distractions here .
i don &apos;t care how sick i am . i have to go back to college .
no !
no !
no , no , no , no , no .
of course you do !
was i the kind of person
who would send her sick sister back to school
just to keep her from figuring out i got fired ?
did i use her laptop
to get through community college ?
let &apos;s get you back there . it &apos;s friday night .
maybe there &apos;s a party you can listen to .
excuse me . i don &apos;t mean to bug you .
hello .
you &apos;re just moving in . i &apos;m right across the street .
listen .
let me stop you .
you had the cameras scheduled ,
worried about how it would look ,
brought your black friend out ,
blasted commodores .
it &apos;s not my first time moving into a white neighborhood .
we &apos;re good .
yeah ?
i did my residency in new hampshire .
all right . listen , you guys need anything , let me know .
you got it . i &apos;m shawn , by the way .
jay pritchett .
jay .
it &apos;s okay , gloria . all handled .
this is my wife , gloria .
this is shawn -- and i want to get this right ,
beautiful african name -- shawn m &apos;badawe .
i said , &quot; by the way . &quot;
hey , lily . we need to talk .
i was actually just heading out .
no . sit down , please .
look , it was wrong of you to be mean to tom , okay ?
even though daddy and i
aren &apos;t always as open @-@ minded as we should be ,
we @-@ we want you to be better than us .
o @-@ kay .
no . listen . we accept people for who they are .
daddy and i would accept you no matter what --
boy , girl , gay , straight ...
though , if you &apos;re a lesbian ,
please be the fun kind .
i didn &apos;t yell at tom because he used to be tina .
what ?
i yelled at him &apos; cause he made fun of ...
made fun of what ?
what &apos;s @-@ what &apos;s to make fun of ?
oh , thank god .
he called you guys weirdos for putting that painting up ,
so i called him a weirdo .
well , honey , why didn &apos;t you tell us ?
&apos;cause i didn &apos;t want your feelings to get hurt .
get hurt ? how ?
because that rube tom knows nothing about art ?
cam , she was protecting us .
but you don &apos;t have to , sweetie , okay ?
don &apos;t feel like you can &apos;t be honest with us
just to protect our feelings .
really ?
really .
hey , you can tell us anything .
okay .
i hate the painting , too .
it was hard for us to hear , but in the spirit of tolerance ,
we accepted the fact that a 9 @-@ year @-@ old
might not want to fall asleep
under the watchful eyes of her half @-@ naked fathers .
call the sistine chapel . i guess art is out .
so , do you hate the whole idea of murals , or just --
roll !
it &apos;s going to be so exciting
to get back to all that science stuff again .
you know -- beakers , calculators , ray guns .
alex , are you sure you don &apos;t want
to spend a few more days here to recover ?
you can sleep on the end of our bed if you want to .
yeah , stay , alex .
sleeping does sound good .
doesn &apos;t it ?
but , first , how about you take a nice , hot shower ?
i just hope that big pile of wet towels isn &apos;t on the floor
like it was this morning .
aww , you guys are so sweet .
no , but what -- what about all the science stuff ?
all the fun . you know -- snapping each other in the butts
with your goggle straps .
you know what ?
staying here a few more days
may help me kick this sickness a little faster .
there you go . wait a second .
i thought i already packed my laptop .
why is it on the hallway table ?
uh , why is anything anywhere ?
why aren &apos;t our feet at the end of our arms ?
who opened my 12th @-@ grade &quot; grapes of wrath &quot; essay ?
oh , my god . you just want me to stay here
so you can steal all of my old homework .
wow . i can &apos;t wait to hear what you have
to say about this lapse in judgment .
hey , it &apos;s better than what mom &apos;s doing .
she &apos;s just using you to yell at us .
i would nip that back talk in the bud .
i can &apos;t believe it . he &apos;s right !
honey , you &apos;re getting upset again .
come on . let &apos;s go get a treat .
stop with the petting and -- and the walks .
you &apos;re using me as a therapy dog .
that &apos;s ridiculi--
am i ?
well ... what about what luke &apos;s doing ?
we just dealt with him .
and , haley ...
you are the only one who really cares about me .
that &apos;s it ! i &apos;m going back to school .
i will drive you , sweetie .
alex , no . stop ! stay !
how do you ask a human not to go , again ?
alex , wait !
right .
we &apos;re still leaving . she &apos;s just catching her breath .
come on . i feel so bad . i had no idea what i was doing .
i feel worse . i really , really knew what i was doing .
our poor sick daughter .
we should be taking care of her .
so , is knowing all this enough ,
or do we have to , like , do something ?
breaks my heart .
i should quit my job and nurse her back to health .
you got fired , didn &apos;t you ?
alex had to take the semester off .
i was disappointed &apos; cause she was disappointed ,
but i was also kind of happy to have her home a little longer .
aww . mask !
cam ?
oh , i just wanted to tell her how proud i was
of how she handled herself today ,
but she &apos;s already asleep . well ,
you can tell her in the morning , okay ?
oh , by the way , i found an article online
about a family of montenegrin art restorers --
let it go , babe . come on . come on .
oh , cam .
look what she did .
jay , what are you doing ? come to bed .
i &apos;ve got these new state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art cameras .
i thought i &apos;d review the day ,
see how many times our neighbor glared at us .
wait a second .
is that manny licking cupcake wrappers from the trash ?
i knew he &apos;d fold .
ah , the vigor . it &apos;s almost pornographic .
are these cameras everywhere ?
yeah . that &apos;s the garbage area .
then we got the backyard , front door .
go inside . wait .
that &apos;s joe peeing in the corner , not stella .
that &apos;s it . he lives outside now .
come . we &apos;ll watch him from the cameras .
hold on .
you have a problem .
i &apos;m gonna get you one of those rubber remotes ,
they put in nursery schools
and insane asylums .
thank you .
