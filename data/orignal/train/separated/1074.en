David Siegel.
Cause of death was a gunshot wound to the sternum.
What do you want?
You're gonna help set me free.
The Mosconi Codex.
You want me to risk jail for a little light reading?
If this book is a puzzle,
maybe these are the pieces.
I know that the codex leads to the window.
Isn't it lucky you were already planning to steal it for me?
The decoder lens. It doesn't work on ours.
Because it's a copy. So what's the plan?
Leverage the decoder for the evidence tape.
Then you'll be free.
Depends on Peter.
You robbed a vault under my watch.
I can explain.
Don't you dare try to justify it.
I did it for you!
Why should we lose everything?
What does it say about me if I let this go?
Neal, you robbed a vault under my watch.
I can explain.
Don't.
Don't you dare try to justify what you did.
I put myself out on the line for you all the time!
I nearly lost everything--
I did it for you!
Make sure dawson has authenticated the confession.
He took a bribe. I did the right thing.
No, it isn't right.
What does it say about me if I let this go?
That's not justice. You're--you're innocent.
I did the right thing.
Why should we lose everything?
None of this is right. Things are gonna change.
I've been promoted. I turned them in.
Don't you dare try to justify what you did.
That's not justice. You're--you're innocent.
Why should we lose everything?
I did it for you!
This is Burke.
I catch you at a bad time?
Bruce, hey, sorry.
I was on a run.
You can relax.
Section chiefs don't go through standard physical evals.
Section chief.
They want me in D.C.?
There was an opening at HQ.
The higher-ups took some convincing,
but I was able to push you for it.
Job's yours.
You need to catch your breath?
No, I--
You know, I gotta be honest, it's--
This is not the best time.
I have case files and pending case files.
It's just--
There will always be cases pending.
I trust you trained the people under you well enough to handle them.
When would I have to be in D.C.?
Two weeks.
That's awfully soon.
Peter, are you ready to leave White Collar or not?
New case?
Potential art forgery at the sullivan auction house.
Figured it'd be the perfect assignment for you and Caffrey.
You and I can take care of it.
Can we talk?
What's on your mind?
Well, I was gonna ask you the same thing.
I'm fine.
Yeah, sure, you're fine,
until I mention Caffrey's name.
Then, you look like you wanna punch a hole through the wall.
It's not that obvious, is it?
Not to anyone else here,
but I've known the both of you long enough
to tell when something's up.
Look, I don't know what happened,
and I'm not gonna ask,
but I just think it's time to end the cycle.
Cycle?
Yeah.
You know, the one where Neal does something wrong,
finds a way to justify it,
and puts you in the hot seat as a result.
So it is that obvious.
Well, Peter, you have an opportunity
few agents in this bureau ever see,
and you should have moved on to it by now.
I mean, you've let one CI hold you back long enough.
I have a few loose ends here that need tying up.
I'm all for tying up loose ends,
as long as they aren't Caffrey.
And Peter, you--
You always take responsibility for him,
but maybe it's time he starts
taking responsibility for himself.
That's all I wanna say.
So how long will the suit box you out?
Oh, he'll call me when he needs me.
His words?
More or less.
I'm guessing more, but you're not wearing
handcuffs and an orange onesie.
That means something.
That means he doesn't wanna go back to prison.
Yet he blames you for his freedom.
He can't see past the fact that the law was broken.
Irony has seldom been more perverse.
Well, this all started with Hagen.
Today, it ends with him.
He wants the window, I want the blackmail he's got on me,
and I don't plan to walk away with nothing.
Yeah, neither does he.
So it's time to make a trade.
Where is it?
In a safe place.
But you're not getting the window,
not today.
That wasn't what we agreed.
I'm renegotiating.
New deal in play.
You get the window, I get the video of me
stealing those gold coins.
I thought you might be inclined to
try something like this,
so I brought along a little incentive for you to consider.
Are you considering, Neal?
Where is she?
If you ever want to see her again,
you will let go of me.
If you hurt her, I swear--
What?
She is innocent in all of this.
I disagree, she's in your life,
and that makes her fair game.
No, this is between you and me.
Rebecca was never a part of our deal.
Well, she is now, and I have her.
Don't presume to know what I'm capable of.
This address.
You have 30 minutes to deliver the window.
If you contact the FBI, she's dead.
You try anything clever, she's dead.
Oh, and if you forget to bring
the little bald friend of yours along,
well, you get the picture.
Look I-I need more than 30 minutes.
That's all you have. That's maybe all she has.
Anything?
Still no audio.
And no indication of where she is.
The visual's too tight.
What about a trace?
According to my software,
this image is being transmitted from a cell tower
halfway around the world.
Hagen covered his tracks.
Yeah, he's bouncing the signal around like a beach ball.
How are we for time?
11 minutes.
What about the address he gave us?
That's an empty train station.
Been closed for years. This could be a trap.
I don't care, I'm getting her back no matter what.
I thought you might say that.
Fortunately, I'm always prepared.
A listening device.
A transmitter with GPS tracking.
This earwig acts as the receiver.
If I plant it on Hagen,
he could lead us to Rebecca.
It's a big if, but it's an option.
Maybe our only one.
Neal, it's not the only one.
No.
No, it's too risky, all right?
He could help us.
After everything Peter and I just went through,
there's no telling what he'll do.
I'm on my own.
No. We're on our own.
Ten minutes and counting. Let's go.
Hey.
Hey, honey.
You okay?
Better now.
You know, I could've met you at the office.
No, it's nicer here.
Yeah.
Bruce called.
I start the section chief job in Washington in two weeks.
Two weeks?
Yup.
Wow. Okay.
Two weeks.
Okay, I've--I've planned parties with less preparation.
I can do this, we've gotta put the house on the market,
and pack everything up.
And we haven't even decided on a neighborhood.
It doesn't feel right.
Honey, we-- we've had this discussion.
I know, but you're the only person
I can talk to about this.
And I will always listen,
but you were innocent.
You deserve to be free.
I've made my peace with what Neal did,
but I'm not sure if I've made peace with myself.
For what?
For accepting it. The timing of this--
Is a sign for you to move on.
Honey, there's something else.
So that's what this is about.
I can't leave until I know the whole truth,
until I really know what happened
to David Siegel that day.
Work?
Yeah.
Possible forgery at an auction house.
I'm interviewing the manager in 15.
Should I dare to ask?
No. Neal's not working with me on this.
What?
You said you made your peace with what he did.
That's right.
Have you actually made your peace with him?
When it comes to work,
I can't let emotions cloud my judgment.
I think you already have.
We're here.
I brought you the glass. It's yours.
Now tell me where Rebecca is.
This is a very small window.
The--the pane acts as a filter.
My guess, you hold it over the original codex,
and you'll see the hidden message mosconi placed in it.
Now let her go.
You're a little taller than I pictured.
A little hackier than I pictured.
Let's see Ms. Lowe then, shall we?
No.
I came through on my end.
Yes, you did.
But now, I'm renegotiating.
The original Chapter 13.
There is a message here.
And you want us to stay and figure it out.
He's smart, and you're slippery,
so better I keep an eye on you both.
How do I know she stays safe?
Funny, isn't it? Don't need a gun.
Don't even need blackmail anymore.
Just one striking image.
Look.
If you want us to solve this puzzle,
you have to tell us everything,
Chapter 13, the stained glass, the masons.
First, where does this all begin?
This all began with another striking image.
This one.
This is a Mosconi.
I was restoring the mural several years ago
when I noticed something.
Each shade of light is different.
Cambridge, cobalt, indigo, teal.
13 distinct hues of blue.
Legend has it that the Masons entrusted Mosconi
with something of great value.
He ensured its safety by hiding it
shortly before he left this country,
But not without leaving a trail.
Those hues that you identified
are the beginning of that trail.
13 is a sacred number for the Masons.
He never referenced it in any other work but one.
The Codex.
Chapter 13.
So, uh, what's the pot of gold?
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.
It's Peter. We've got a case.
Agent Burke can wait.
I don't think you get it.
If I don't show up, Peter gets suspicious.
If he gets suspicious, he checks my anklet,
which leads him right here.
Fine, but your friend stays. Any--
I wanna talk to her before I leave.
I'll stand right here until you hand me the phone.
Rebecca, it's me. It's Neal.
I can't hear her.
She can hear you. And that's good enough.
Listen to me. I'm coming for you. It's gonna be okay.
I'm gonna get you out of there. Just--
Bad form to keep a lady waiting.
Hurry along to Agent Burke.
I'll have this all figured out before you get back.
Just go.
If anything happens to her or him,
you'll see what I'm capable of.
Tell me what you see.
A lot of people,
but I'm sure we'll find Waldo in there somewhere.
I'm not in the mood for levity.
Well then, let's not waste any time.
You have someplace else to be?
You rang, I came. Is there a problem?
Your tone, for starters.
Insubordinate?
Edgy. What's going on?
Of course I'm edgy.
You're upset with me,
and I have no idea what I can do or say to make it right.
Just do your job.
Mr. Rawling, you're the house manager?
You must be Agent Burke.
This is my colleague Neal Caffrey.
Is this the piece in question?
A vision of the Last Judgment by William Blake,
thought to have been lost for over 200 years.
How did it come to your auction house?
Anonymous seller.
I'd have called us as well.
Of course, Gentlemen, I do have the information for the seller,
but I can't provide it
until the painting has been proven inauthentic.
You don't wanna upset the vendor
and risk your commission. Understandable.
Neal?
Okay. Let's see what we see.
Tracing sheets won't help.
Anything placed between the page and the glass
distorts the concealed image.
Tell me something useful.
Okay.
Um, there's a certain tiger fish
that's been known to eat crocodiles.
You are an odd little creature.
Yeah, and you're a stock thug.
You can't even do your own dirty work.
Your obvious weakness is your hubris.
You speak with such authority.
I've dealt with guys like you before.
Then you know we have big teeth
and very little patience.
Stay focused.
There's a hidden image on each page.
It looks like it's from some ancient language.
Trace the images.
Paint directly on Mosconi's pages?
We need to line them up
so we can see the bigger picture.
You'll destroy the original Chapter 13.
Is it so difficult for you to take a leap of faith?
I reserve my leaps of faith
for space exploration and the chupacabra.
I thought you were the artist.
Show me what you can do.
Oil and tempera paints are aged perfectly,
mixed what just the right amount of chalk.
If it's a forgery, it's a good one.
Monotype processing.
Initially inked on a non-absorbant--
What is it?
The initials "C-H."
Curtis Hagen.
We're going after the Dutchman again.
I want everything that you can dig up
on Hagen since his release:
where he's staying, who he's associated with,
what he is having for dinner.
I mean everything.
Yeah, on my way.
I didn't think Hagen would slip up so soon,
but I guess he did.
Yeah, but why use the same M.O.
that landed him prison in the first place?
Ah, it could be something he pulled out of storage
for a quick payday.
The information on the seller.
Thanks.
"Douglas Nemon."
Obviously, an alias Hagen's using.
No known residence, but we have a P.O. Box,
and we have a telephone number.
Do you have any buyers lined up?
Several.
Good.
The FBI is about to become one of them.
You have a plan?
We clear the art as authentic,
let the sale of the piece go through,
and track the money back to Hagen.
Could work.
Mr. Rawling, grab whatever you need.
You're gonna come back to the bureau with me
So we can put this transaction in motion.
All right, we finished here?
When I say we are.
look, I did my part.
Why don't you wanna see this through?
Honestly?
I don't like you looking at me as some kind of liability.
All I did was help you.
At a cost I'm not comfortable with.
Well, more comfortable than a prison cell.
Watch it.
I did what you couldn't.
What?
You heard me.
You took a system I believe in and corrupted it.
Because that system didn't believe in you.
Don't say another word. Now, we are finished here.
Go home.
Mr. Rawling, you ready?
You bet.
Let's go.
Nice cigars.
You know, it's bad luck to celebrate
before a job is finished.
You like this? Nicaraguan Imperiales.
Great with scotch.
When this is over,
you light up a stogie and release Rebecca?
Just like that?
I said I would.
And Neal?
He served his purpose.
"A wise man does not waste
so good a commodity as lying for naught."
I'm flattered you think me wise.
I was referring to Neal.
When this is over, he's gonna make you pay,
and you won't even know it's happening.
I'm not that easily fooled.
I know more about you than you think.
Well, I know a little about you too.
About me?
Yeah, good luck.
I think Theodore Winters would need the luck.
Don't you?
I know your name. Do you know mine?
Moz, you all right?
Yeah, I'm okay for now.
So is Rebecca.
What was the pressing matter?
You're getting what you want.
How much longer do you need to keep her?
You didn't answer my question.
It's a forgery investigation.
Second-rate hack trying to sell
a Vermeer knock-off to the Met.
Amateur hour.
Let me talk to Rebecca.
I swear, I didn't say anything to Peter.
Now, let me talk to her.
Excuse me.
By all means, carry on.
Hello? Yes. Of course.
All right. Keep working on the pages.
Pretend you're explaining the process to me.
Was it really a forgery case?
Yeah, except the artist was Hagen.
What?
He put a piece on the market.
They found his signature hidden in it.
Why risk selling a fake now?
I don't know, probably to raise capital.
He can't fund a treasure hunt on unemployment.
Something isn't right.
Yeah, starting with the timing.
And the signature? He's smarter than that.
Maybe this is all part of his plan.
I have no idea,
but he can't know the FBI is after him.
Yeah, he'll think you sold him out.
That's not good for Rebecca.
Well, you'll need ears and eyes
on the suit's investigation.
All taken care of.
You still have that earwig?
That's a fast turnaround.
We've had some very enthusiastic bidders.
What was the going price?
950,000.
That's good.
I assume you still have my account number.
Once we finalize the paperwork,
the money will be transferred to you.
Thank you very much.
Got nothing on the cell trace.
Well, we still have the account.
Let's have someone from tech
ready to engineer a false transaction.
Mr. Rawling, we're gonna need you
to give a statement to one of our agents.
It may take some time.
If you would.
How many more pages?
Two.
Now one.
Neal, if you'd be so kind
as to apply the finishing touch.
Why?
Ceremony.
And because I said so.
Hagen may have his bases covered
when it comes to the phone,
but we'll see how good he really is in a minute.
If this doesn't work?
It'll work.
We might need Caffrey after all.
I mean, we may have the tech,
but he knows how someone like Hagen thinks,
what his next move could be.
I won't let Hagen make another move.
Jones, I thought about what you said,
about how Neal needs to take responsibility for himself.
Yeah.
You're right.
I need to keep a distance.
So why did you take Neal
to the auction house in the first place?
That was a mistake.
Listen, I wanted to ask you earlier.
What happens to Neal when you leave?
He's the next ASAC's problem.
You know, because I could...
Jones.
Don't volunteer to take him on.
Trust me. You'll regret it.
Come on. Let's see if our setup's ready.
Something wrong?
Almost finished.
It's done.
This isn't like the other ones.
So I'm guessing that's the pot of gold?
Let's see how we get there.
I've never seen this language before.
Neither have I.
That's why you're next task is going to be
to translate it for me.
That could take days, weeks, maybe.
Rebecca doesn't have that time.
Better get a move on.
We're not doing this.
You have any ideas?
Got something.
Hang on.
This is a real time link to the IP activity
on Hagen's account, courtesy of our friends downstairs.
Money for the forgery was transferred two minutes ago.
Strong signal this time.
Doesn't look like there's any re-routing.
I knew he wouldn't wanna wait.
He had to check on his money.
There's only one computer logging in to that account at the moment,
And it's right here in New York.
已证实
We got him. Downtown brooklyn.
Assemble a team and move out.
The FBI's on the way.
Never my favorite words.
If they grab Hagen,
I may never see her again, Moz.
There's gotta be a play here.
I think I just found it.
All right, take a look at the pages,
a good look.
Rain man it.
I got it.
You got it?
Yeah.
Good.
What are you doing?
Take one more step and I drop it.
You're bluffing.
You drop that light, and she's as good as gone.
Yeah, so is the Codex.
It's your choice: you release Rebecca
or watch everything you work for go up in smoke.
What's gonna be?
We need to talk about this.
You have five seconds to decide how important this message is.
We may have forgotten to mention
that the FBI is en route.
You are...
A particular kind of bastard?
Yeah, I heard that one before.
Three seconds.
Two seconds.
Stop.
One!
Call whoever you need to call, and make it fast.
I want her out of there.
Let her go.
Put her on the line.
Give her the phone.
Rebecca?
I'm here, Neal.
All right, listen to me. Wherever you are, you run.
Get to a populated area. You understand?
I'm -- I'm going.
Just keep moving and stay on the line, okay?
Okay.
all right.
Satisfied?
Not quite.
Here's a striking image for you.
Back exit.
We can cut over to six, hit the bridge.
This time of day, we can be there 10, 15 minutes tops.
NYPD can get there faster.
Already coordinated. We'll have their eyes.
But the arrest belongs to us.
I'm not letting Hagen get away
with another technicality.
So I'm assuming you don't wanna tell Caffrey.
He'll know when he needs to know.
In the meantime, have someone from the Bureau pull his tracking data.
All right, you think he's up to something?
Told him to go home. Wanna make sure he did.
Rebecca, where are you?
I think I'm somewhere in Brooklyn.
Neal, we have to go now.
All right, hold on. You have it, right?
Every symbol safely stored here.
I am the Codex now.
I need you to get a safe house ready.
We need a secure place to hole up
in case Hagen comes after us.
And you?
Just call me when you're done.
All right, I'm still here.
I'm still with you.
Is anyone following you?
I'm not sure. Maybe. I don't know.
I'm not hanging up until I know you're safe.
I'll only feel safe when I'm with you.
All right, what are your cross streets?
What do you see?
Uh, Kent and Flushing?
Neal, I'm scared.
I'm on Taylor right near the park.
I'm coming to you.
I'm passing Hall street.
Do you see anyone behind you?
Lots of people. I-I don't know.
All right, I'm almost at Flushing.
All right, I'm turning toward you now.
I'm still here.
I'm still here too.
Thank god.
It's okay.
It's okay. I'm still here.
You okay?
Yeah.
You sure?
Yeah.
Agent Burke, is your team ready?
Yes, sir.
I'll take point.
Let's move in.
That's a go.
FBI.
Hands where I can see them.
Agent Burke.
We have so much to discuss.
Are you sure it's safe to be here?
It's only temporary.
Moz is gonna find a safe place for you to stay
until this whole thing blows over.
Rebecca, it's time to end this.
What? You mean tell the FBI?
Yeah.
No. No way.
You'll get into trouble.
Look, we started this together.
And now, you wanna finish it?
Tell me what you found.
Well, all the pages held hidden symbols,
symbols that added up to some kind of message,
culminating with a picture of an idol.
Describe the idol.
It was Hindu, female.
Did she have a crown?
Yeah.
What are you thinkin'?
Is this what you saw?
Yes.
This is the idol of Sita, deity of wealth.
It was created centuries ago.
I've heard about it.
The idol had eyes made out of rare diamonds.
But over the years, the idol vanished.
And only one of the diamonds was ever recovered.
A stone which is now sitting in the Smithsonian.
The hope diamond.
We're looking for its twin.
The other eye, the other diamond,
it could be right here in New York.
Yeah, Hagen said the masons entrusted Mosconi
with something of great value.
There's a lot of gap years in the history of the idol.
So it's possible the Masons had it at some point.
That diamond is a good reason
for Hagen to go to all this trouble.
It's a good reason for you
to decode those symbols you found.
Where are the pages?
The codex is gone.
To save you, I had to destroy it.
There's still a way we--
You have a safe house?
What I have is bad news.
The FBI's got Curtis Hagen in custody.
How do you know?
I heard it through the earwig.
If he tells Peter there's footage of me taking those coins,
it sets off a chain reaction that lands us all behind bars.
What are you gonna do?
Anything I can to make sure that doesn't happen.
What is it?
I have to leave.
I'll be back. I promise.
Be careful.
Recognize this?
William Blake, if I'm not mistaken.
Judgment Day. Pretty fitting.
More like rush-to-Judgment Day.
The painting's a fake.
You've no proof that it's mine.
I wouldn't be so sure.
Why would I do something that bold?
Well, I think that you got out of prison,
had that piece ready to go,
and decided to make some quick cash.
What, ride off into the sunset? Is that it?
You tell me.
It's too rudimentary.
Criminals aren't that complicated,
and if I remember correctly,
I caught you the first time because of your ego.
Maybe prison humbled me.
I doubt it. People like you don't change.
Heard we got Hagen.
Stay at your desk.
I didn't sign this painting.
You saying you were framed?
Say that was the case.
Now, we have to think, who did it?
Had to be someone who knew me,
had to be someone who knew
that I used to sign my work.
That'd be anyone in this division.
Someone in this division
who has an affinity for art forgery.
Neal?
You're lying.
What if I made you an offer?
I'll take a confession.
There's something to show you,
your eyes only, my place.
This conversation's over.
You can bring all the people you want,
all the backup you need,
but you're gonna want to keep this strictly between us.
Peter. A moment?
I checked Caffrey's tracking data.
You're not gonna like it,
especially when you look at the time stamp.
What is it?
He was with Hagen all afternoon.
Peter--
Save it.
We're all takin' a ride.
This is as far as they go.
It's okay. I got it from here.
This better be worth my time.
It's worth more than that.
Really? What's that?
Freedom, Agent Burke.
All right, stop.
Look, this could be a setup. We don't know what's in there.
I do, evidence.
How can you be sure?
I love watching the two of you dance.
A bit cathartic, really.
Shut up.
By the way, you're going to prison again.
I doubt that.
Keep dreaming.
I have been dreaming of payback,
for the two of you taking away years of my life.
You did that to yourself.
Now, I'm doing it to you.
Beg.
What?
Beg me for your freedom.
Shots fired!
Everybody get down! Get down!
All Agents, subject down!
Call medics and SWAT!
Close off immediate area now!
Hagen.
Hagen.
You were at that building with him.
Think I wouldn't check your anklet?
What were you doing, Neal?
I was working with Hagen.
Peter, listen to me. He was threatening Rebecca.
I didn't have a choice.
Then you should've told me.
I couldn't take that risk.
What sort of work was it?
Some kind of puzzle he wanted me to solve.
Look, I'll explain everything later.
What's important is that Rebecca is safe now.
Why did Hagen bring me here?
Like I said, it could've been a setup.
"Beg me for your freedom?" What did that mean?
Look, that could mean anything.
He could've been setting me up.
I mean, you heard him. He wanted revenge.
Who did this? And I swear, if you hold back--
I have no idea who would've taken him out.
Hagen's place has been tossed.
Someone did a pretty
thorough sweep of the apartment, and recently.
Have the team go through it with a fine-tooth comb.
All right.
Can I see that?
No, personal effects that were on the victim
My handler's right over there.
I'm not gonna try anything. Please.
Thanks.
I'll be right back.
Call the building manager. Check Hagen's mail.
I want something.
You got it.
Don't think I'm finished with you.
I found this in Hagen's wallet.
"Blue Ground Cafe." It's a coffee shop.
"8154 Linden Avenue."
That's the same block where we found Siegel's body.
Uh-huh. Check out the back.
Hagen was watching someone all day and taking notes.
Could be anybody.
Could be whoever shot him.
Barista remembered Hagen.
Not much else.
All right, Hagen sat right here all day.
He was looking at something.
That building across the street?
People moving in and out.
Good vantage point if you're watching someone.
Noting when they enter...
And when they exit.
I'll need to contact the super
to get a list of all residents in the past six months.
Or just check the directory.
Neal, who's listed in apartment three?
No one. It's blank.
That might explain the question mark.
Siegel was here, and so was Hagen.
They we're looking into the same person.
Let's see who lives in number three.
I don't think anyone's home.
Wait.
Electronic trip wire.
Careful.
What is all this?
Neal, this is professional reconnaissance work.
This is all my movements over the past year,
perfectly catalogued.
A map of your radius.
Someone has been studying you.
Not just me.
This is everyone who's in my division.
The entire team.
Neal?
Whoever murdered Siegel also framed Hagen.
Probably killed him as well.
This was practice.
This is Rebecca's apartment.
Who is she, Neal?
Neal?
Neal?
