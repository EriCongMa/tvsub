you think i hit my son in the face ?
i was trying to give him a spanking
and he ran away from me into a doorjamb .
and , quite frankly , this is all your fault .
you were the chaperone on a seventh grade camping trip
and allowed our sons to spend the night in a tent together ,
with out my permission .
did you quit your job because of me ?
i care more about defending you than i do about keeping my job .
you shouldn &apos;t ,
because we did do something on the camping trip .
i made an inventory .
it &apos;s what they call it in aa .
what i &apos;m most ashamed of is that i loved getting high
more that i loved you .
i wish we could adopt callie .
dad didn &apos;t sign the papers .
he did , but they didn &apos;t actually ever get sent .
because i took them out of the mail and ripped them up .
i can &apos;t sign the papers again . i love you .
i don &apos;t love you .
i &apos;m your sister .
no you &apos;re not ,
you &apos;re a spoiled little brat .
we can &apos;t do this .
well , i &apos;m not getting adopted .
quickly , please , in here .
please , hurry .
ok , everybody back . let &apos;s give them some room .
he was telling me he was
upset about a fight he &apos;d just had with his ...
and he just grabbed his chest , like , he couldn &apos;t breathe ,
and ... and ... and he started shaking ,
i had to help him to the ground .
is he ...
panic attack .
it wasn &apos;t ... it wasn &apos;t a heart attack ?
nope . happens all the time .
really ?
the symptoms are pretty similar : chest pain ,
shortness of breath , rapid heartbeat ...
and you &apos;re sure ?
i &apos;m pretty sure , yeah . the ekg looks fine .
but we should probably take you in
for some observation , just to be 100 percent certain .
no , no . i &apos;m fine .
no , robert . you should ...
ok , if you think i should .
what &apos;s going on ?
i mean , he said he signed the papers .
shouldn &apos;t he have to , like , stick to that ?
you &apos;d think so , wouldn &apos;t ya ?
well , he was clearly upset by the whole thing .
i think ... i hope , anyway ,
that with a little time and space from the drama of it all ,
he &apos;ll come to his senses .
you really think that &apos;s gonna happen ?
i do , actually . this all went down so fast ,
and there was so much emotion involved .
he just needs a little room to change his perspective .
he &apos;s gonna do the right thing , i know it .
i can &apos;t believe he pulled this . he seemed like such a nice guy .
yeah , well , not everyone is not what they seem .
it &apos;s a lesson for all of us .
hey , callie ... hey .
it &apos;s gonna be ok . we &apos;re gonna work this out .
you hear me ?
ok . ok , listen , why don &apos;t
you all go get changed out of your clothes .
put on something comfortable ,
we &apos;ll put something out for dinner . ok ?
i was looking for you before dinner , but i ...
no , i know . i , um ... i came out here hoping you ...
yeah , i know , i saw you go so i figured ...
callie ...
i ...
you know , actually ,
i don &apos;t think i can handle anymore bad news today , brandon .
it &apos;s not bad news . not really .
i just don &apos;t want you to give up .
i know . i know .
ok . good night , then .
night .
hey , bub .
i just wanted to check up on you .
it &apos;s quite a day , huh ?
are you all right ?
about all the callie and robert stuff ?
yeah .
it &apos;s gonna be ok though , right ?
yes , honey ... it &apos;s gonna be fine .
and thank you for telling me
i know that wasn &apos;t easy for you ,
and i really appreciate your being honest with me .
are you gonna tell connor &apos;s dad ?
uh ... no , i don &apos;t think so .
i don &apos;t work at anchor beach anymore , so i don &apos;t have to ,
and i really don &apos;t see any reason to upset things any further .
you know , honey ,
what you guys did , it wasn &apos;t wrong .
it just , it wasn &apos;t appropriate on a school trip .
i just don &apos;t want you to feel ashamed for ...
you know , for being curious .
ok .
ok .
she &apos;s just devastated , as i &apos;m sure you can understand .
so i was hoping that you ... you could talk to your husband .
i know why you &apos;re here . i understand completely .
but i &apos;m not sure i agree .
i was with you , i really was .
i knew that robert and sophia were getting too
invested in callie ,
and i knew they were gonna get hurt ,
but i also knew that they would be fine ,
because they only want what &apos;s best for callie .
and then it sort of dawned on me .
they only want what &apos;s best for callie .
because they love her .
and when she called him her father yesterday ,
seeing how he lit up and ...
and how devastated he was that he upset her ,
he had a panic attack , for god &apos;s sake .
i just ...
i just think he deserves a chance to get to know her
a little better before all this is decided .
i didn &apos;t know you were ...
stef stopped by to talk about ...
yesterday .
yeah , of course .
all right , look , um ....
i feel awful about everything that went down .
sincerely .
i &apos;m sure you do .
and that &apos;s why i &apos;m here .
i &apos;d just like to see you make things right .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m trying to do .
no , robert , i think you need to sign the papers .
look , um ... i just wanna
have some sort of relationship with my daughter .
well , she doesn &apos;t want to have a relationship with you . not now .
and after that stunt yesterday ,
lena and i are not going to try to persuade her otherwise .
well , i &apos;ve been trying to figure out a way to handle this .
i was hoping it would be a little more civil ,
but you don &apos;t leave me any choice .
you &apos;ll be hearing from my lawyers tomorrow .
i &apos;m gonna petition the court for custody .
damn . good job .
you ever been to one of your dad &apos;s aa meetings ?
like to see him get a chip or something ?
uh , yeah , a couple times . why ?
what &apos;s it like ?
aa ? kinda weird ,
but , you know , my dad was happy i went though .
why was it weird ?
uh , everyone &apos;s sitting around ,
talking about all the horrible things they did ,
and then everyone else is laughing .
laughing at them ?
no , no , no , more like with them .
like , they &apos;ve done worse stuff , so ...
what ... what &apos;s the matter ?
you think you got a little drinking problem ?
is this ... about ana ?
nah , i was just curious .
ok . dude , don &apos;t get all wrapped up in ...
so do you think it really works ? aa ?
i think so , yeah . i hope so .
i kinda have to , you know ?
all right , man , you &apos;re up .
right .
you know , maybe we should ...
lower it ?
yeah , lower it .
one , two , three and four .
and five , six , seven , eight .
and one , two , three , four .
five , six and ...
that was really good .
it was ! except for the end .
maybe we could , like , simplify it ?
we could , but , i mean , don &apos;t you wanna end with a bang ?
you know , really impress the judges ?
you &apos;re gonna get it .
when ? the competition &apos;s this week !
maybe i should just give up my solo ...
what ? no , no . absolutely not .
it &apos;d be better for the team .
no , it wouldn &apos;t ! mariana , when you &apos;re on , you &apos;re fierce .
hey , and i know you didn &apos;t
make me spend all my free time coaching you
just so you could bail at the last minute .
ok , now come on , let &apos;s do that last eight .
you just gotta spot that turn .
ok ?
ok .
and five , six , seven , eight .
* wait for it *
* wait for it *
* here it comes *
* like a cannon sounding *
* but you can &apos;t break from the crowd *
* you been to the desire *
* caught in the crossfire *
* here it comes *
* you try to outrun the pounding *
* when it stormed in like a cloud *
* it must make you so tired *
* being caught in the crossfire *
oh , my god , you guys are so good together !
come on , walk me out .
so , apparently , we are good together .
at least that &apos;s what your sister thinks . what about you ?
what are you being so weird about ?
nothing . i just ...
i just hope the band doesn &apos;t go all fleetwood mac .
no doubt ?
i hope brandon and lou dating doesn &apos;t ruin everything .
brandon and lou are dating ?
oh , my god . that makes so much sense .
i was wondering why she kept giving him those bedroom eyes .
don &apos;t worry , i &apos;m sure it &apos;s all gonna be fine ...
come on , i gotta get home .
brandon , stop it .
why ? why did you have to go over there ?
wait , you think this is my fault ?
are you &apos;re kidding me !
you think that robert decided that he wanted custody of callie ,
simply because he saw me standing on his patio ? seriously ?
i &apos;m sure it didn &apos;t help ,
seeing you standing there all defensive and territorial !
he was already upset . why couldn &apos;t
you just give things a little time to cool down ?
you &apos;re so impulsive ! you can &apos;t ever leave well @-@ enough alone .
well , i &apos;m sorry , lena , i am who i am .
but i &apos;m not gonna be blamed for
being impulsive by a woman who just quit her job on a whim .
i was trying to defend jude .
what do you think i was trying to do for callie ? !
and protect jude from what ?
from getting into trouble for the shenanigans in the tent ?
which he actually did !
i love this about you ,
how passionate and idealistic you are , lena ,
how you would do anything to protect our kids ,
but by trying to protect one , you are hurting all of them .
excuse me ?
we cannot raise this family on one salary .
i &apos;m gonna get another job .
before the mortgage is due ?
what are you doing ?
i &apos;m going to sleep on the couch .
no , you &apos;re not .
you gonna stop me ?
you &apos;re not gonna sleep on the couch ,
because we have a house full of kids ,
and as soon as one of them sees you ,
they &apos;re all gonna know that something &apos;s wrong ,
and we &apos;re gonna have five
freaked out teenagers and nobody wants that !
so get your ass in bed ! please . please .
listen ...
what are you doing ? what is that ?
a wall .
to make sure you don &apos;t touch me tonight .
well , you don &apos;t have to worry about that .
i &apos;m sorry .
i know i was being all cranky on
saturday when you went to that fundraiser thingy .
you totally gave me the silent treatment yesterday .
i did not !
hayley , i texted you like 50 times ...
and i replied . once .
with a big pile of dookie emoticon ... that &apos;s not a reply .
ok , ok ... i &apos;m sorry .
i was talking to my mom about it and she was all ,
&quot; being there for people you care about is really important . &quot;
and i know you care about callie . i mean , she &apos;s like your sister .
and you care about me , right ?
yeah , you know i do ...
so you &apos;re coming to the dance competition ?
my solo &apos;s , like , amazing .
yeah , my whole family is gonna be there .
your whole family is coming to see me ?
yeah , well , i mean , i guess i am .
mariana &apos;s on the dance team , remember ?
oh . right .
so i got a very interesting phone call this morning .
it seems one of the big @-@ wigs at idyllwild
saw you play at some music competition last fall ,
and would like to offer you a full ride
to go to their summer music program .
yeah , i know , it &apos;s just one
of the most prestigious programs in the country .
but i ...
brandon , you know how this looks on a college application ?
you can basically write your
own ticket to any music school in the country .
no , i know , but my hand ... remember ?
right ...
i mean ,
that competition was before all this happened .
i can &apos;t play like that anymore .
ok , i hear you . but if you were gonna give it one more shot ,
idyllwild would be the place to do it .
they got some of the best teachers , experts ...
therapists in the world .
but , i ...
just ... will you think about it ?
i got a little time before we need to let them know .
all right .
i just want you to know i hear your concerns .
it &apos;s not something i take lightly ,
and we &apos;ll review again at the end of the year , ok ?
anybody have any questions ?
i have a question ...
you don &apos;t have to avoid me , ok . i &apos;m not mad .
you &apos;re not ? you seemed pretty mad the other day .
well , i &apos;m over it , ok . it &apos;s fine .
you just gotta stop telling your moms everything , ok ?
did your mom really quit her job ?
why , like , because of my dad ?
wow . is she ok ?
i think so .
we &apos;re ok ?
yeah .
did you do the science homework ? i didn &apos;t get it at all ...
coach kim wants everyone to read the rules for the competition .
a few years ago we lost because of a technicality
and she &apos;s all flipped out that we &apos;re gonna , like ,
have the wrong barrettes or something and get disqualified so ...
really ? nobody ?
what ? i like to be informed .
ok . so i &apos;ve been thinking ,
and i think we need to rearrange the orders of the solos .
wait , the competition is tomorrow , why are we making changes ?
i think we have to flip
mariana &apos;s and david &apos;s ,
so when we end up in formation for the last section ,
we make a better inverted triangle .
so i &apos;m still third ?
and i &apos;m last ?
but the music &apos;s really different at that part .
it &apos;s still two counts of eight . can we just try it please ?
that was beautiful .
thank you .
where is this coming from ?
um ... i got offered a scholarship
for this summer program .
um ... idyllwild , if you &apos;ve ...
yeah , of course .
yeah .
that &apos;s so cool .
hungry .
two @-@ thirds or sixth ... that &apos; not ... i don &apos;t know , bud .
you &apos;re going to have to talk to one of your siblings about this ,
&apos;cause back in my day , math did not look like that .
hey . so , i have got good news
and i have some ... less good news .
the good news is , i got my job back .
you did ?
and the less good news is
i &apos;m going need to sit down with connor and his dad
and talk about the camping trip .
it &apos;s important to monte , and ,
to be honest , it &apos;s important to me , too .
there are some things , as a mom , that i can overlook ,
but that as an administrator ,
i have to deal with , and this is one of them .
but , i &apos;m sure everything &apos;s gonna be fine .
i don &apos;t want you to worry , ok . i just wanted to let you know .
ok .
you roll over anymore i &apos;m giving you a dog treat .
i &apos;m sorry , i &apos;m just freaking out about the competition tomorrow .
i know it &apos;s stupid , it &apos;s just a contest .
no , it &apos;s not stupid .
you &apos;ve been working really hard and it &apos;s important to you .
well , yeah , but it &apos;s kind of nothing compared
to what you &apos;re going through .
you know what game no one wins ?
let &apos;s rank our troubles .
besides , it &apos;s super not fun .
i &apos;m just sorry i have to work
so i &apos;m gonna miss your big win ... unless you blow it .
hey , is brandon with lou ?
oh , yeah . totally . mat &apos;s , like , freaking out about it .
he &apos;s almost 100 percent sure they &apos;re walking into ,
like , a &quot; no doubt &quot; situation ,
which i totally didn &apos;t get until
he told me that gwen stefani used to be with that drummer guy ...
or wait , which one was it ?
which one has the crazy eyes ? anyway ...
we should probably get some sleep .
yeah , right . like that &apos;s gonna happen .
jude , why don &apos;t you tell mr. stevens what you told me ,
about what happened in the tent .
so , um , that night , after bed check ,
we had some girls come into our tent
and we played some games and stuff .
then we ending up making out with them and ...
and ?
uh , nothing . that &apos;s it .
well , that was exactly what i was afraid of ...
is it ? exactly ?
yeah . it is .
look , i know you think
i &apos;m some sort of big homophobe or something , but i &apos;m not .
i just want to make sure that
my kid &apos;s properly supervised when he &apos;s supposed to be .
you &apos;re absolutely right , sir . we hear you , loud and clear ,
and we are gonna make some changes in the way we ...
we chaperone trips like these .
thank you . i just want connor to be able to be a kid .
not grow up so fast .
but he is growing up ,
and , maybe you &apos;re right about one thing ,
he &apos;s getting a little old for me to be spanking him , so ...
you &apos;re still grounded , but that &apos;s it . ok ?
well , i think it &apos;s safe to
say we all learned a little something here .
why don &apos;t you head back to class .
well , that &apos;s good your dad &apos;s being cool .
i can &apos;t believe you told your mom . again .
i didn &apos;t tell ...
i can &apos;t ... i ...
i can &apos;t be friends with a little bitch
who tells his mom every time something happens .
oh ! you made it !
like i was gonna miss a chance to see you shine .
aw , thank you .
i &apos;m really proud of you .
wow . they &apos;re really good .
i know .
mariana .
oops , gotta go .
i &apos;ll be the one hollering the loudest .
ok , so i &apos;ve been doing a little recon ,
and after seeing what the other teams are doing ,
i think we should cut that last solo
and put in that double time section we &apos;ve been working on .
wait ... you &apos;re cutting my solo ?
what the hell ?
i &apos;m sorry , but it &apos;s the weakest one .
no , it &apos;s not ! and why do we have to cut a solo anyway ?
we need a bigger finish if we &apos;re gonna win .
and mariana was a hot mess at practice yesterday .
yeah , because you changed her placement !
the music was totally different !
i mean , you basically sabotaged her .
i &apos;m sorry , are you accusing me of something ?
yeah , i &apos;m accusing you of being a jerk .
well , this jerk happens to be team captain ,
and since coach kim isn &apos;t here ,
what i say , goes .
if you don &apos;t like it , you don &apos;t have to dance .
what did you just say ?
come on , kaitlyn . tia &apos;s like our best dancer .
you don &apos;t have to do this .
you heard me .
this is a really important competition for us
and i don &apos;t think mariana is ready .
if you disagree , you don &apos;t have to be on the team .
you know what ? you &apos;re right , i don &apos;t . i quit .
good luck , guys .
your honor , we found him , like you wanted .
uh , we served him papers , like you asked .
um , he even signed them .
so where are they ?
well , from what i can gather , his daughter destroyed them .
that is true , your honor , but it &apos;s also true
that i regretted signing them the second i did it .
look , this whole , horrible mess ...
it &apos;s made me clear on one thing ...
callie is my daughter and i love her .
and we all ...
we believe that callie belongs with us .
and what do you think , callie ?
go ahead , tell him .
i think the adams / fosters are my family .
and nothing is going to change that .
well , like all custody issues , this is a tricky one .
both sides make compelling arguments :
familiarity , in the case of the adams / fosters ,
versus biology , in the case of the quinns .
arguments that , under other circumstances ,
would be the definitive winner .
but these are not other circumstances .
so here &apos;s what i think we should do ...
let &apos;s take the remainder of the 180 @-@ day abandonment period
and make sure we &apos;re making the most informed decision possible .
until that time , callie will remain in her current foster home .
but ... i &apos;d also like callie
to spend one day a week with her father .
fine .
i &apos;ll see robert once a week ...
but i won &apos;t see anyone else . i won &apos;t go to the house ,
i won &apos;t see jill and i won &apos;t see sophia .
you guys , we can &apos;t do this without tia .
well , i &apos;m not dancing if she is , so ...
you guys , it really shouldn &apos;t be that hard .
it &apos;s really just comparative geometry .
ok , look , ok , we &apos;re going from seven people ,
an odd formation , to six , an even one .
anytime we &apos;re in three , five , seven
it just becomes two , four , six .
there &apos;s never a point person .
so if that &apos;s you , you just give up the middle , reset
so you &apos;re equidistant from your partner and the midpoint .
ok , anchor beach , you &apos;re up .
kaitlyn , we &apos;re supposed to share centre ...
come on , mariana .
everybody comes up here and talks about
how they hit rock bottom and
then started turning their lives around but not me .
i hit rock bottom ,
definitely the time i left my kids
on christmas day to go get high .
merry christmas , kids , mommy got you some crack .
i mean , who does that ?
so , yeah , i hit rock bottom ,
stayed there for about a decade ,
and then decided i was ready .
so , i think one day at a time ,
god willing , things are different now .
god , i hope so .
i just pray that i can do better
for this baby than i did for my twins .
thank you .
go away , sophia .
please , just listen to me .
no .
i just wanted to apologize .
i don &apos;t care , you &apos;ve ruined my life .
all right ? so leave me alone .
i didn &apos;t mean to , callie . ok , i &apos;m sorry .
i am so , so sorry .
save it , sophia . ok .
there &apos;s nothing that you can say that will make me forgive you .
don &apos;t say that !
if you don &apos;t forgive me ... i &apos;ll kill myself .
don &apos;t be melodramatic .
i mean it .
just go home . i have work to do .
oh , my god ! you were amazing !
duh ! i know ! but thank you .
oh , be right back .
don &apos;t even talk to me right now .
i stuck my neck out for you and ...
... and we qualified .
yeah . i saw . congrats .
you &apos;re not hearing me . we qualified .
you remember those rules that kaitlyn was handing out ?
you know , the ones you made fun of me for taking ?
well , i actually read those ,
and it turns out only one member of the qualifying team
has to be on the competing team at state .
and i qualified . that &apos;s why i didn &apos;t walk off with you .
ok , so ...
so , let &apos;s start our own dance team .
if i have to listen to kaitlyn for one more second ,
i &apos;m gonna shoot somebody .
most likely her .
and i &apos;m way too pretty to go to jail .
i can &apos;t believe you . god , you are so sneaky , you know that ?
sometimes i use my powers for good . so you in ?
yes , yeah , abso @-@ freaking @-@ lutely .
good .
all good ?
oh , yeah .
ooh , hey , kaitlyn ,
guess what ? i quit ! bye !
we got in a fight , and i was upset ,
so i wasn &apos;t looking when i walked into the street .
i &apos;m so embarrassed ...
well , you need to pay more attention .
thank god nobody was seriously hurt .
this could have been really terrible
for you and a lot of other people .
all right , i uh ...
i gave both the drivers my information ,
so , obviously , we &apos;re going to pay
for all the damages here , so thank you .
ok , have a good night . be careful .
and thank you , callie , for calling us .
it wasn &apos;t an accident .
what ?
we were having a fight ,
and she told me that
if i didn &apos;t forgive her she &apos;d kill herself .
i didn &apos;t realize it at the time , but she meant it .
she walked into traffic .
you know it wasn &apos;t an accident .
sophia ?
is that ... is that true ?
why ... ? why would you ...
sometimes i just wanna die .
what ?
i don &apos;t really think i can do this any more .
come on . come on , let &apos;s get you home .
see you at home .
so what &apos;s gonna happen to her ?
well , robert said they &apos;re gonna get her some help , so ...
oh , thank god .
if any of you is ever feeling like that ,
i want you to come talk to us , ok ?
and if you don &apos;t wanna talk to us ,
talk to a sibling , or somebody .
there &apos;s always someone who &apos;ll understand , ok . you promise ?
yeah .
hey , bub , i &apos;ve got a plate for you in the oven .
thanks .
no , i got this .
so what was it ? wrestling ?
coach was in a mood , made us stay late .
hayley was pretty upset that you weren &apos;t there tonight .
honestly , i was , too .
it &apos;s hot , it &apos;s hot ...
how was your performance ?
she was amazing . and she totally saved the show .
really ? i &apos;m sorry i missed it .
yeah , me too .
but we &apos;re gonna see it when they go to state .
what ? you made it ?
looks like it .
nice !
hey , how was your solo ?
so , i was , uh , thinking about this summer ...
and , uh , here &apos;s the thing ... the band is gonna go on tour .
yeah , well , good for the band ...
mom ...
brandon , you &apos;re 16 .
seventeen . almost .
ok , almost 17 .
do you really want to spend the summer
between your junior and senior years of high school
playing gigs in dive bars in albuquerque ?
yes .
why don &apos;t you let us talk about it for a little while ,
it &apos;s a big decision .
ok , all right , yeah .
as long as you think about it .
oh , we &apos;ll think about it .
ok .
are you really serious about this ? the tour ?
yeah .
what about the scholarship ?
you &apos;re not even gonna consider going to idyllwild ?
are you gonna tell stef and lena ?
no , and i would appreciate it if you didn &apos;t either .
fine , but your just going to give that up ?
brandon , classical music is ... that &apos;s like your one true love .
well , we don &apos;t always get to have our one true love , do we ?
is it because of lou ?
is that why you wanna go on tour ?
&apos;cause you &apos;re seeing her , right ?
it doesn &apos;t hurt , sure .
but , no , that &apos;s not why i &apos;m going on tour .
i &apos;m going on tour because i think it would be freaking awesome .
is lou why you can &apos;t be with me ?
no .
it &apos;s not ?
no , you &apos;re the reason why i can &apos;t be with you , callie .
you don &apos;t know what you want .
you &apos;re just reacting all the time .
and you only ever come to me when things get hard for you ,
or when everything is going wrong .
do i have feelings for you ? of course , i have feeligns for you .
i &apos;m always gonna have feelings for you .
but i don &apos;t ... i don &apos;t trust you .
i didn &apos;t mean it in a bad way .
is there another way to mean it , brandon ?
i &apos;m done .
we &apos;re done .
we have to be done .
