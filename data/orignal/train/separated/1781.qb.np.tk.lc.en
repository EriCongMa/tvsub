oh , look at all that chest hair .
and overbite .
of course you &apos;re a wolowitz .
son of a bitch , he bit me .
okay , i guess i &apos;ll just go to the emergency room to be safe .
howie , this is just your hypochondria .
when i sat on the mute button and thought i &apos;d gone deaf ,
that was my hypochondria .
we &apos;ll find another time to tell him i &apos;m pregnant .
morning .
morning .
&quot; we &quot; ?
what is this ?
i don &apos;t know .
maybe it says something on the back .
&quot; continued on milk . &quot;
if you &apos;re tricking me into making my own breakfast ,
it didn &apos;t work for my mom , and it won &apos;t work for you .
&quot; are . &quot;
&quot; we are ... &quot;
&quot; see spoons for more . &quot;
what could it be ?
&quot; we are groot &quot; ?
&quot; we are the champions &quot; ?
&quot; we are family &quot; ?
&quot; i got all my sisters with me . &quot;
are you serious ?
yeah .
are you sure ?
pretty positive .
that &apos;s a joke , because the pregnancy test says ...
oh , my god .
this is incredible .
we &apos;re gonna be parents ?
we &apos;re gonna get to board planes first .
finally gonna get to see
what &apos;s in that family bathroom at the mall .
i know , it &apos;s crazy .
it is crazy .
i mean , how do you ... prepare for something like this ?
i &apos;m not even sure i &apos;ve held a baby before .
oh , it &apos;s okay , you &apos;ll figure it out .
but how &apos;s this all gonna work ?
do we get a nanny ?
i mean , can we afford a nanny ?
and if we can , we can &apos;t get a pretty one ,
&apos;cause it &apos;ll wreck our marriage .
we can &apos;t get an ugly one , &apos; cause it &apos;ll scare the kid .
i @-@ i don &apos;t know , howie .
are we in a good school district ?
you &apos;re catholic , i &apos;m jewish .
what religion do we raise it ?
and if it &apos;s a boy , do we get him circumcised ?
people say it &apos;s barbaric ,
but if we don &apos;t , it looks like a pig in a blanket .
calm down , it &apos;s gonna be okay .
how &apos;s it gonna be okay ?
look at me , i &apos;m a mess .
and that means this baby &apos;s gonna half a mess .
and that &apos;s even before we screw it up
with our cut @-@ rate moderately attractive nanny .
hey , raj , i read a couple guys in your department
may have discovered a new planet in our solar system ?
oh , i heard about that .
why didn &apos;t you discover it ?
because instead of being in the telescope room ,
i was busy making you guys homemade jam for the holidays .
well , you be sure to let us know
when you win the nobel prize for boysenberry .
hello .
hey , bud .
ready to play when you are .
yeah , um , in a minute .
i actually need to tell you guys something .
if it &apos;s &quot; thank you &quot; for the homemade jam you got in december ,
congratulations , you &apos;re the first one .
what &apos;s going on ?
i &apos;m , uh ...
uh , gonna be a father .
that &apos;s so amazing .
what ? congratulations .
oh , no .
why &quot; oh , no &quot; ?
because this changes everything .
what about comic book night ?
uh , what about playing games together ?
what about our trips to disneyland ?
how can we do those things with a child around ?
relax , there &apos;s room for two babies in this group .
oh , dear lord ...
penny &apos;s pregnant , too ?
you &apos;re the other baby .
oh , really ?
okay , well , would a baby have to shave once every 11 days ?
would an adult refuse to eat his graham crackers
because one of them was broken ?
i guess we &apos;ll call this a draw .
so , i &apos;m glad you guys are here .
there &apos;s something i want to share with you .
howie and i are going to ...
leonard says you &apos;re pregnant .
what ?
&quot; don &apos;t say anything .
act surprised when she tells you . &quot;
all right , how you want to do this ?
i &apos;m pregnant .
oh , my god , i can &apos;t believe it !
this is so exciting !
yeah , it &apos;s all real exciting .
are @-@ are you not happy about this ?
i am . of @-@ of course i am . i &apos;m ...
i &apos;m sure it &apos;s just the hormones .
but it &apos;s weird--
howie &apos;s the one who &apos;s been talking about having kids for years ,
and i was all excited to tell him
because i thought he &apos;d be thrilled ,
but then he started to flip out
and now this feels like a bad idea
and i &apos;m gonna get fat .
no , no , come on . come on , you &apos;re not gonna get fat .
you &apos;re gonna be beautiful and glowing
and @-@ and have the cutest little baby bump ever .
easy for you to say , skinny bitch .
sorry , hormones .
oh , that &apos;s all right . all i heard was &quot; skinny . &quot;
i wouldn &apos;t make too much out of howard
not reacting the way you expected him to .
yeah , i &apos;m sure it was just the initial shock of it all .
you &apos;re probably right .
after we talked about it , he started to calm down .
i shouldn &apos;t be raising a kid .
i don &apos;t even eat my own vegetables .
buddy , i @-@ i think you might be overreacting .
and then there &apos;s this nose .
i mean , what if he looks like me ?
or worse ...
what if she looks like me ?
not to mention the impact on our social circle .
everything &apos;s going to change .
howard won &apos;t be able to come over as much .
well , he could bring the baby here .
oh , but then we &apos;d have to baby @-@ proof the apartment .
you know , my sister has one of those toilet locks in her bathroom .
i have two doctorates , i still had to go in the sink .
oh , my god , and do you have any idea
how expensive having a kid is ?
i read that in los angeles , raising a child through college
can cost over a million dollars .
a million dollars ?
god , it &apos;s like my nuts just kicked me in the nuts .
that &apos;s it-- i got to start
earning more money right now .
i know-- you could ask bernadette
for a raise in your allowance .
this isn &apos;t a joke .
i wasn &apos;t joking .
it &apos;ll be fine .
people have kids every day .
you &apos;ll figure this out .
yeah , come on ,
this is great news and you know it .
you &apos;re right , it is , i &apos;m just ...
a little overwhelmed right now .
hey , you know what we should do ?
all get vasectomies so this doesn &apos;t happen to us ?
go out and celebrate .
but not your worst idea .
hey , let &apos;s go do something to get your mind off this .
yeah , yeah , we should go out .
where ?
uh , i don &apos;t know , a bar ?
can &apos;t drink .
we can , but all right .
are you hungry ? how about that sushi place you love ?
doctor said i can &apos;t have sushi .
okay , look , we don &apos;t have to go anywhere .
we can just , you know , stay here and hang out in the hot tub .
doctor said i can &apos;t go in the hot tub .
maybe you should get a new doctor .
what , he said you can &apos;t laugh either ?
i &apos;d like to propose a toast to our friend , howard--
his , um , his big heart , his beautiful soul ...
and his tight little pants
that somehow did not make him sterile .
cheers .
well , look at this .
i bet whoever invented tiny umbrellas
doesn &apos;t have to worry about money .
he can have all the kids he wants .
and can keep a small portion of their heads dry .
if i &apos;m gonna have any chance of raising this kid ,
i need to come up with a big idea to make some money .
there &apos;s no reason you can &apos;t .
that &apos;s easy for you to say .
you and sheldon already came up with your superfluid helium model .
that &apos;s just research .
we &apos;re never gonna make any money from it .
forget helium . the real superfluid
is the fruit punch in this mug .
reminds me of my daddy &apos;s secret
&quot; don &apos;t tell mama &quot; juice .
uh , these are strong , you should slow down .
i &apos;ll just take one last sip .
okay , how about this for an invention--
slightly ... bigger cocktail umbrellas .
how is that a new invention ?
i don &apos;t know , all apple does is change the size of things
and we keep buying them .
it &apos;s true . i like my giant ipad
and my little ipad
almost as much as my regular @-@ sized ipad .
this place is terrific .
why @-@ why have we never been here before ?
the same reason we don &apos;t do a lot of fun stuff-- you .
that &apos;s some smart talk from a guy
who can &apos;t even keep his face in focus .
where &apos;s the bathroom ?
uh , it &apos;s in the corner .
excuse me .
hey , how you doin &apos; ?
i hope the bathroom is clearly marked .
doesn &apos;t matter . he &apos;s headed for the kitchen anyway .
maybe that &apos;s an idea--
guidance systems for drunk people .
they have that . it &apos;s called uber .
in your supercooled helium experiments ,
did you create quantum vortices ?
yeah . why ?
well , if you made a guidance system ,
couldn &apos;t you use those vortices as a gyroscope ?
i &apos;ve never thought about that .
and since it &apos;s in a quantum state ,
it would maintain an infinite persistence .
groundbreaking revelations , tropical drinks .
tell me this isn &apos;t like the
best episode of sex and the city .
you may have actually just come up with something .
you think so ?
i really do .
you guys , the bathroom here is amazing .
there &apos;s people cooking in it .
think about all the fun things you get to do when you have a baby .
yeah !
yeah , you get to buy toys and little clothes .
i kind of already do that for howie .
and @-@ and whenever you &apos;re hungry ,
you &apos;ll be in a minivan with cheerios all over the floor .
oh , and i just found a new travel cup for sheldon .
it only lets out three at a time .
so , when did you guys decide to get pregnant ?
well , we didn &apos;t exactly decide .
we were talking about it ,
and then one night we got a little reckless .
oh , tell us !
yeah , tell us .
no , i &apos;m embarrassed .
oh , come on , we &apos;re all grown @-@ ups .
we &apos;ve all done it .
me ! me @-@ me , too !
i &apos;m a grown @-@ up and i &apos;ve done it !
fine .
we were out one night ,
and things got a little spontaneous .
oh , that sounds juicy .
well , sheldon was going on and on about time zones
and railroad schedules , and i went out ...
wait , i remember that . hang on .
you did it at our place ?
kind of on sheldon &apos;s bed .
what ? !
no !
i was headed to the bathroom ,
and i passed howie on his way out .
usually he says , &quot; do not go in there , &quot;
but this time he said , &quot; hey , let &apos;s go in here . &quot;
how could you do that ?
i &apos;m sorry ,
but you know what it &apos;s like when you &apos;re with your man
and one thing leads to another .
i do know what that &apos;s like . i really do .
i &apos;m not seeing anyone
using liquid helium vortices like this .
i &apos;m not finding anything either .
that &apos;s a good sign .
oh , wait , i found something .
damn . what is it ?
this video . the baby panda sneezes ,
and the mama panda gets so scared .
can you focus on what we &apos;re talking about ?
all right .
look , now , this may be the rum talking ,
but as long as the unpinning rate of the vortices
is kept within 1.1 and 1.3,
the magnus force issue should be negligible .
even drunk , he &apos;s still smarter than all of us .
and stronger .
yeah . who wants to see me beat up the bartender ?
i &apos;d enjoy that .
nah , she &apos;s a good kid .
if this is a viable thing , we could get a patent
and license it to companies that make guidance systems .
look at that . you &apos;ve known you &apos;re gonna be a father
for less than a day and you &apos;re already stepping up .
i &apos;m telling you , you got this .
maybe you &apos;re right .
of course he &apos;s right .
you and i both know how hard it is growing up without a father .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m confident you &apos;re gonna be
the best dad you can be .
thank you , sheldon .
you &apos;re welcome .
and if he has twins , we can do
all kinds of neat experiments on them .
you guys can go in if you want .
no , we &apos;re a team .
if you can &apos;t go in , we &apos;re not going in .
then why are we drinking ?
okay , it &apos;s not like she &apos;s got the christ child in there , all right ?
oh . it &apos;s leonard .
he says sheldon &apos;s drunk and they &apos;re gonna do karaoke
if we want to join them .
that sounds fun .
oh , no .
sheldon &apos;s drunk texting me .
what &apos;s it say ?
&quot; would you like to sing karaoke with us . &quot;
how is that a drunk text ?
he used a period instead of a question mark .
he &apos;s so wasted .

thank you , pasadena ! good night !
that was such a fun night .
probably &apos; cause you got to see your man
up there rockin &apos; the mic .
yeah , yeah . i was a little surprised
when you decided to beat @-@ box .
that was really an asthma attack .
i just sold it .
well , i am so happy for howard and bernadette .
me , too .
so , you ever think about it ?
babies ?
well , i &apos;m not in a rush but someday , yeah , sure .
what about you ?
i think we &apos;d make amazing parents .
will you guys keep it down ?
on the other hand , we might lack a certain maturity .
