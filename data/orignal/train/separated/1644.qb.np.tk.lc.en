damn you , walletnook.com !
problem ?
the online description was completely misleading .
they said eight slots , plus removable id .
to any rational person , that would mean room for nine cards ,
but they don &apos;t tell you , the removable id takes up one slot .
it &apos;s a nightmare !
okay , now , do you really need
the honorary justice league of america membership card ?
it &apos;s been in every wallet i &apos;ve owned since i was five .
why ?
it says &quot; keep this on your person at all times . &quot;
it &apos;s right here under batman &apos;s signature .
... and this is leonard and sheldon &apos;s apartment .
guess whose parents just got broadband .
leonard , may i present , live from new delhi ,
dr.and mrs.v.m.koothrappali.
hi !
tilt up the camera up ! i &apos;m looking at his crotch .
sorry , papa .
oh , that &apos;s much better .
hi .
hi !
and over here is sheldon .
hi !
he lives with leonard .
oh , that &apos;s nice .
like haroon and tanvir .
no , no . not like haroon and tanvir .
such sweet young men .
they just adopted the cutest little punjabi baby .
no , we &apos;re not like haroon and tanvir .
so , are you boys academics like our son ?
yes .
and your parents are comfortable with your limited earning potential ?
oh , yes .
not at all .
papa , please . don &apos;t start .
it was just a question .
he &apos;s so sensitive .
okay , that &apos;s my life . that &apos;s my friends .
good to see you . say good @-@ bye .
bye .
bye .
wait ! wait !
before you go , we have good news .
put the computer down and gather your friends .
what is it , papa ?
i don &apos;t see your friends .
is it just me , or does web chatting
with your clothes on seem a little pointless ?
rajesh , do you remember lalita gupta ?
the little fat girl that used to kick me in the samosas and call me untouchable ?
yes .
well , now she &apos;s a dental student at usc ,
so we gave her your contact information .
why did you do that ?
you &apos;re 26 years old , rajesh .
we want grandchildren .
but , papa , i &apos;m not supposed ...
lalita &apos;s parents approved the match .
if you decide on a spring wedding , we can avoid monsoon season .
a spring wedding ?
it &apos;s up to you , dear .
we don &apos;t want to meddle .
if you don &apos;t want to meddle , then why are you meddling ?
if i may , your parents probably don &apos;t consider this meddling .
while arranged marriages are no longer the norm ,
indian parents continue to have
a greater @-@ than @-@ average involvement in their children &apos;s love lives .
why are you telling me about my own culture ?
you seemed confused .
sorry , mumi , papa , but with all due respect ,
i really don &apos;t want to ...
i &apos;m sorry , darling .
we have to go .
doogie howser is on .
grandma ! it &apos;s doogie time !
bye @-@ bye !
bye @-@ bye !
i don &apos;t believe it .
neither do i.
doogie howser &apos;s been off the air for like 20 years .
actually , i read somewhere that it &apos;s one of the most popular programs in india .
it might speak to a cultural aspiration
to have one &apos;s children enter the medical profession .
i bet you &apos;re right .
i bet they love scrubs .
what &apos;s not to love ?
excuse me ! hello ?
my parents are trying to marry me off to a total stranger .
what am i going to do ?
i suggest you go through with it .
what ?
romantic love as the basis for marriage
has only existed since the 19th century .
up until then , arranged marriages were the norm ,
and it served society quite well .
it &apos;s the entire premise of fiddler on the roof .
i &apos;m not a big fan of musicals , but i love that show .
me too .
of course , it speaks to me culturally .
understandable , but there &apos;s a universality to that story which transcends ethnicity .
let &apos;s not forget it &apos;s got some really catchy tunes .
oh , absolutely .
yeah !
okay , i know what i &apos;m going to do .
what ?
find new friends .
so who wants to rent fiddler ?
no need , we have the special edition .
well , maybe we are like haroon and tanvir .
&lt; font color = &quot; # ffff00 &quot; &gt; the big bang theory season01 episode08 &lt; / font &gt;
this is dr.sheldon cooper .
yeah , i need to cancel my membership to the planetarium .
well , i &apos;m sorry , too , but there &apos;s just no room for you in my wallet .
i understand , but it was between you and the museum of natural history ,
and frankly , you don &apos;t have dinosaurs .
i &apos;ll miss you , too . bye @-@ bye .
okay , i know you &apos;re texting about me and i &apos;d really like you to stop .
oh , dear , i am rightly and truly screwed .
hey , i thought you were finding new friends .
i &apos;ve got some feelers out .
in the meantime , listen to this .
hi , rajesh . this is lalita gupta .
uh , your mother gave my mother your phone number to give to me .
so , i &apos;m calling you and ... call me back . bye .
can you believe how pushy she is ?
so don &apos;t call her .
if i don &apos;t call her , i won &apos;t hear the end of it from my parents .
so call her .
how can i call her ? you know i can &apos;t talk to women .
i &apos;m done . anybody else ?
give me the phone .
why ?
just give it to me .
what are you doing ?
don &apos;t worry . you &apos;ll thank me .
hello , lalita ? raj koothrappali here .
yes , it is good to talk to you , too .
so what are you wearing ?
oh , not important .
uh , so , anyhow , when would you like to meet ?
friday works for me !
i &apos;ll call you with a time and place .
but in the meantime , keep it real , babe .
you may now thank me .
for what ? making me sound like a simpsons character ?
fine . next time make your own date .
i didn &apos;t want to make this one !
look on the bright side , she might turn out to be a nice , beautiful girl .
great , then we &apos;ll get married ,
i won &apos;t be able to talk to her
and we &apos;ll spend the rest of our lives in total silence .
it worked for my parents .
hi , guys .
oh , hey .
i need some guinea pigs .
okay , there &apos;s a lab animal supply company in reseda you could try .
but if your research is going to have human applications ,
may i suggest white mice instead ?
their brain chemistry is far closer to ours .
i swear to god , sheldon , one day ,
i &apos;m going to get the hang of talking to you .
his mom &apos;s been saying that for years .
what &apos;s up ?
well , i finally convinced the restaurant to give me a bartending shift ,
so i need to practice mixing drinks .
oh , great .
well , the key to acquiring proficiency in any task is repetition .
with certain obvious exceptions .
suicide , for example .
so , leonard , how about it ?
you know , penny , we &apos;d love to help you ,
but 拉杰 is going through some stuff right now ,
and besides , he doesn &apos;t drink , so ...
really ?
um , raj is going through some stuff right now and he &apos;d like to take up drinking .
okay , here you go , leonard .
one tequila sunrise .
thank you .
you know , this drink is a wonderful example of
how liquids with different specific gravities
interact in a cylindrical container .
thank you .
okay , raj , what &apos;ll it be ?
whatever you recommend .
uh , how about a grasshopper ?
i make a mean grasshopper .
okay ? good.coming up .
sheldon , what are you going to have ?
i &apos;ll have a diet coke .
okay , can you please order a cocktail ?
i need to practice mixing drinks .
fine .
i &apos;ll have a virgin cuba libre .
that &apos;s , um , rum and coke without the rum .
yes .
so ... coke .
yes .
and would you make it diet ?
there &apos;s a can in the fridge .
a cuba libre traditionally comes in a tall glass with a lime wedge .
then swim to cuba .
bartenders are supposed to have people skills .
okay .
raj , here you go .
all right . who &apos;s next ?
i &apos;d like to try a slippery nipple .
okay , you &apos;re cut off .
anybody need a refill ?
where did my life go , penny ?
one day i &apos;m a carefree bachelor ,
and the next i &apos;m married and driving a minivan
to peewee cricket matches in suburban new delhi .
are you talking to me ?
is there another penny here ?
i had such plans .
i had dreams .
i was going to be the indira gandhi of particle astrophysics .
but with a penis , of course .
amazing .
ever since i was a little boy ,
my father wanted me to be a gynecologist like him .
how can i be a gynecologist ?
i can barely look a woman in the eye !
you know what ?
i &apos;m not going to let my parents control my future any longer .
it &apos;s time for a showdown .
somebody give me a computer with a webcam !
okay , sweetie , i think that &apos;s the grasshopper talking .
and it &apos;s about to tell my parents that
i &apos;m not riding an elephant down the aisle with lalita gupta .
okay , calm down .
look , no one can make you get married .
why don &apos;t you just meet this girl and see what happens ?
haven &apos;t you been listening to me ?
i cannot talk to women .
um , raj ...
no , no , let &apos;s see how long it takes him .
um , raj , honey , you say you can &apos;t talk to women ,
but you &apos;ve been talking to me .
and now we &apos;ll never know .
you &apos;re right . i ...
i am talking to you .
hello , penny , how are you ?
i &apos;m fine .
okay , now i just need to make sure i have a lalita before i meet the grasshopper .
it &apos;s a sweet , green miracle .
okay , if you &apos;re going to drink on this date ,
just promise me you won &apos;t overdo it .
overdo what ?
happiness ?
freedom ?
this warm glow inside of me that promises everything &apos;s going to be all hunky @-@ dunky ?
yeah , that .
why don &apos;t you bring her to my restaurant
while i &apos;m tending the bar so i can keep an eye on you .
okay .
wait a minute . what &apos;s the plan here ?
let &apos;s say he meets her , he likes her , they get married .
what &apos;s he going to do , stay drunk for the rest of his life ?
worked for my parents .
i can &apos;t believe i &apos;m sitting here next to little lalita gupta .
well , you are .
little lalita .
that &apos;s fd of kinun to say .
little lalita , little lalita , little lalita .
you should try it .
oh , it &apos;s okay .
you have lost so much weight .
that must have been difficult for you because you were so , so fat .
do you remember ?
yes , i do .
of course you do .
who could forget being that fat ?
well , i &apos;ve been trying .
so you &apos;re a dental student .
mm , are you aware that dentists have an extremely high suicide rate ?
not as high as , say , air traffic controllers , but , then ,
there are far mo dreentists than air traffic controllers ,
so in pure numbers , you &apos;re still winning .
yay , me .
do you have a drink that will make him less obnoxious ?
drinks do not work that way .
i &apos;d say he &apos;s doing fine . look at her .
the last girl my mom set me up with had a mustache and a vestigial tail .
sorry i &apos;m late .
what happened ?
nothing . i just really didn &apos;t want to come .
virgin diet cuba libre , please .
okay .
in a tall glass with a lime wedge .
oh , i &apos;ll wedge it right in there .
so how &apos;s koothrappali ...
oh , my lord .
what ?
that &apos;s princess panchali .
i &apos;m pretty sure her name &apos;s lalita .
no , no , princess panchali , from the monkey and the princess .
oh , yeah .
i tried to watch that online , but they wanted my credit card .
it &apos;s a children &apos;s story .
oh , no , it isn &apos;t .
when i was a little boy and got sick ,
which was most of the time , my mother would read it to me .
it &apos;s about an indian princess who befriends a monkey
who was mocked by all the other monkeys because he was different .
for some reason , i related to it quite strongly .
i know the reason .
we all know the reason .
sheldon , what are you getting at ?
that woman looks exactly like the pictures of princess panchali in the book .
how often does one see a beloved fictional character come to life ?
every year at comic @-@ con .
every day at disneyland .
you can hire snow white to come to your house .
of course , they prefer it if you have a kid .
hey , guys .
isth is lalita gupta .
lalita , this is leonard and sheldon and howard and penny .
isn &apos;t it great ? she isn &apos;t fat anymore .
forgive me , your highness , for i am but a monkey ,
and it is in my nature to climb
i did not mean to gaze upon you as you comb your hair .
i &apos;m sorry ?
you are the living embodiment of the beautiful princess panchali .
oh , no kidding .
who ... who is that ?
a beloved character from an indian folktale .
us indian or &quot; come to our casino &quot; indian ?
you indian .
the resemblance is remarkable .
i can practically smell the lotus blossoms woven into your ebony hair .
well , thanks .
i imagine you smell very nice , too .
i shower twice a day and wash my hands as often as i can .
really ? so do i.
but you &apos;re a dentist . he &apos;s nuts .
don &apos;t be insulting , rajesh .
so , sheldon , tell me more about this princess you say i look like .
it was said that the gods fashioned her eyes out of the stars
and that roses were ashamed to bloom in the presence of her ruby lips .
oh , my .
back off , sheldon .
what ?
if you do not stop hitting on my lady ,
you will feel the full extent of my wrath .
i &apos;m not hitting on her .
and i am not your lady .
and you have no wrath .
you are my lady .
our parents said so .
we are , for all intents and purposes , 100 % hooked up .
okay , let &apos;s get something straight here .
the only reason i came tonight was to get my parents off my case .
i certainly don &apos;t need to be getting this old world crap from you .
that &apos;s exactly the kind of spirit with which princess panchali
led the monkeys to freedom .
screw princess panchali .
hey , you can &apos;t talk to me like that .
but you &apos;re not princess panchali .
luckily for you-- she could have you beheaded .
sheldon , are you hungry ?
i could eat .
let &apos;s go .
what just happened ?
beats the hell out of me .
i &apos;ll tell you what happened .
i just learned how to pick up indian chicks .
what are we supposed to say to lalita &apos;s parents ?
i play golf with her father .
i won &apos;t be able to look at him .
maybe you should keep your eye on the ball , papa .
oh , now you &apos;re a funny man .
this is not funny , mr.funny man .
dr.and mrs.koothrappali , in all fairness ,
it wasn &apos;t entirely raj &apos;s fault .
this is a family matter , sheldon .
i &apos;m leonard .
oh , sorry . you all look alike to us .
but he &apos;s right , papa .
listen to him .
you ! you are the one who ruined everything .
who is it ? we can &apos;t see .
turn us . turn us .
go ahead , tell my parents why they won &apos;t have any grandchildren .
how would i know ?
do you have a low sperm count ?
this has nothing to do with my sperm count .
you are wearing the boxers that we sent you , aren &apos;t you , rajesh ?
yes , mumi .
because you know what happens to the samosas when you wear tighty @-@ whities .
can we please stop talking about my testicles ?
sheldon , tell them what you did .
what did i do ?
you left with his date .
friends don &apos;t do that to each other .
all right , noted .
sorry .
sorry ? that &apos;s all you can say is sorry ?
take it , raj . it &apos;s more than i &apos;ve ever gotten .
and may i point out , she woavdn &apos;t hule asked me to go with her
if you hadn &apos;t been drunk and boring .
drunk ?
and boring-- her words .
i knew it .
he moves to america and he becomes an alcoholic .
i &apos;m not an alcoholic .
then why were you drunk ?
it was just this one time , papa , i swear .
are you in denial ?
do we have to come over and do an intervention ?
don &apos;t embarrass him in front of his friends .
all right .
carry us outside .
we want to talk to you in private .
but , papa , please ...
now , rajesh !
i have to go .
now , listen to me ...
at least wait till i get into the hall .
okay , well , good night .
hold on .
what happened with you and lalita ?
we ate , she lectured me on the link between gum disease and heart attacks--
nothing i didn &apos;t already know-- and i came home .
so you &apos;re not going to see her again ?
why would i see her again ?
i already have a dentist .
i wonder who &apos;s going to tell his parents they &apos;re not having grandchildren ?
to life , to life , l &apos;chaim
l &apos;chaim , l &apos;chaim , to life
life has a way of amusing us blessing and bruising us drink ,
l &apos;chaim , to li ... fe .
i don &apos;t believe it . what &apos;s gotten into him ?
maybe a couple virgin cuba libres that turned out to be kind of slutty .
you didn &apos;t .
