and maybe rip a grape off a stem--i &apos;m starving .
whole foods , wow .
reminds me of when i was a whole person .
max , we can stop looking for the club .
all right , all right .
i &apos;m gonna lay down some beats while you check out our beets .
organic !

this is why i didn &apos;t want to know anything !
you ask a guy his name
and you find out he &apos;s dj &apos;ing next to radishes .
and what kind of loser comes here to dance ?
holla !
and i don &apos;t mean the kosher bread !
oh , no . how did you find me here ?
whole foods is my sexy secret .
you know what &apos;s not a secret ?
the organic preparation h in that basket .
whole foods is where i come to get my groove on .

as much as i &apos;d love to see what else you &apos;re gonna buy
to rub on your butt , we &apos;re leaving
before that dj sees me .
you mean dj fresh @-@ and @-@ local ?
the music be bumpin &apos; and we buyin &apos; pumpkins !
let &apos;s go . i can &apos;t believe i wore these for this .
wake up .
it &apos;s tuesday , and the dj didn &apos;t come .
maybe he just drank too much .
no ! he didn &apos;t show at all .
there &apos;s no dj fresh @-@ and @-@ local in my ones and twos .
well , what did you expect ?
you ran out of there without even saying &quot; hi . &quot;
we should &apos;ve stayed at the club .
stop calling it a club !
he djs at a supermarket ,
which is the lamest thing i &apos;ve ever seen ,
not counting the time
you tried to bring back the phrase
&quot; oh , no , you didn &apos;t . &quot;
i &apos;m surprised at you .
what if i judged you for some of your jobs ?
uh , bar @-@ back slash captain of a shrimp boat
in the gulf of mexico isn &apos;t the bomb ?
what about when you worked at the gap ?
who told you about the gap ?
you , that time you were drunk , folding a sweater ,
and you tried to help me &quot; spring into summer &quot;
with cargo shorts .
fine ! i fell into the gap . i needed the money .
maybe sebastian needs the money , too .
who ?
and if you ever tell anyone about the gap ,
you will have a gap between your neck
and where your head used to be .
&quot; oh , no you didn &apos;t . &quot;
hey , i wasn &apos;t sure if it was too late to come by
but the ouija board said , &quot; go ahead , the girls are up ! &quot;
you use that ?
the only spirit i listen to is 2 @-@ buck @-@ chuck ,
and he mostly tells me to take my top off .
yeah , ouija helps me make all my big decisions .
like coming to america ,
adopting a chinese orphan ,
and leaving a chinese orphan at the fire station .
those boards are creepy .
you never know what you &apos;re inviting in .
i mean , what if we open a hellmouth ?
aw , come on , girls , look around .
i mean , you already have .
okay , now shh . okay ...
ouija ,

oh , now , see , that is creepy
because i was shoving it to &quot; no . &quot;
do you want to get back with him ?
well , i &apos;m torn .
and also , i don &apos;t know what to do .
throw your hands in the air like you just don &apos;t kale .
max , i &apos;m proud of you for overlooking his job
and giving this guy a chance .
he &apos;s making a dj face . i &apos;m out .
oh , my god , dylan .
no , we can &apos;t leave now .
i just saw this girl ,
and she is the last person i want to see .
what is the problem ?
it &apos;s hilary waldare .
we went to wharton together .
so competitive with me .
loved it when i lost all my money .
she even threw a party to celebrate
and then had the nerve to invite me .
worst party ever , by the way .
uh , worse than being at a dance club that has a price club ?
max black in the house of grain .
and now he saw me .
well , i &apos;m gonna go hide before she sees me .
i &apos;ll be in tom &apos;s shoes . nobody &apos;s ever over there .
