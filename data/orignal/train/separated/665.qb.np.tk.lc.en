emily &apos;s not your friend , amanda .
you need more proof ?
i called your lawyer
i had her send over a messenger with the divorce papers .
it &apos;s time to end this .
your family has been calling nonstop .
羟考酮止痛片 遵医嘱服用
you gotta face &apos; em eventually .
take the box .
bury your father &apos;s secrets away from here .
come to paris with me .
i can &apos;t .
hello , danny .
no ! no , no , no ! amanda !
my god .
i @-@ i didn &apos;t .
go . my truck &apos;s up the road .
the keys are inside .
hey !
mom !
it &apos;s tyler .
mom ?
i ...
don &apos;t say a word .
my father &apos;s false imprisonment taught me that
in a crisis you quickly find out who your real friends are .
tragedy and scandal , it seems ,
have a unique way of clarifying people &apos;s priorities .
we heard a cell phone ring
up by the sand dune .
i saw someone in a dark hoodie
hiding behind the saw grass .
i don &apos;t know . it could &apos;ve been a hoodie .
it could &apos;ve been anything , like a guest from the party .
it &apos;s hard to say .
tyler wasn &apos;t a bad person . he--he was sick .
the guy went all benihana on my arm
and tied me to a chair .
that boy was a menace .
if you people had been doing your jobs ,
you &apos;d have made sure the little psychopath stayed locked up
after holding us all hostage at gunpoint .
when i went home to get daniel clothes ,
i saw that my gun was missing .
i &apos;d left a window open . tyler must have ...
broken in and stolen it while we were at the party .
so what were you and mr. barrol fighting about ?
i don &apos;t remember a fight .
you have 15 stitches in your head .
how do you explain that ?
tyler had a history of violence ,
he threatened your whole family at your birthday party .
look , i can understand
if you felt like your life was in danger ...
you shot him , didn &apos;t you ?
don &apos;t say a word .
i don &apos;t remember .
mr. and mrs. grayson ,
you &apos;ve had a very busy few months here in the hamptons .
are you charging him ?
not yet ,
but if you &apos;re planning on joining
the labor day exodus to the city ,
don &apos;t .
well , then we &apos;re going to be taking him home .
in case it &apos;s lost upon you , he has severe head injury .
he &apos;s also covered in blood , presumably the victim &apos;s ,
who was apparently killed by bullets
fired from his fiancee &apos;s gun .
no , we still have a lot of questions .
yeah , which won &apos;t be answered until his lawyer is present .
or do you want me to call him right now
and just let him know that my son &apos;s rights are being violated ?
mr. grayson , come with me .
come on . let &apos;s go home .
we have a car waiting for you .
i &apos;m gonna go with emily ,
but i need to speak to my mother first ...
alone .
whatever you need .
smart move , running back to the house to create a cover
for how tyler got your gun .
it might not even matter .
tyler could &apos;ve told daniel everything .
tyler &apos;s not exactly a reliable source ,
and ... daniel loves you .
unless that &apos;s changed .
we had an argument at the party .
i &apos;m not sure where we stand .
well , you &apos;re standing in a police station ,
and i would say the more pressing issue
is the whereabouts of your father &apos;s infinity box .
it &apos;s safe and sound .
you ready to go ?
yeah .
are you okay ?
what were you talking to your mother about ?
we had words at the party .
i just ...
i just wanted to clear the air .
that &apos;s good . you &apos;re gonna need ...
as much support as you can get right now .
daniel , what happened on the beach with you and tyler ?
弗兰克 · 史蒂芬 梅森 · 特德韦尔
what &apos;s this ?
why don &apos;t we call your fiancee and ask her ?
i did , after all ,
find it underneath her living room floorboards .
i don &apos;t remember .
i had the cook set up some breakfast
in case you &apos;re hungry .
i &apos;ve also been tracking the media coverage
of daniel online .
wait a second . wait . how , uh ...
who alerted the media ?
well , there &apos;s a picture online of daniel
in his bloody tux .
someone from the party must have snapped it .
oh , well , so much for decorum .
she &apos;s right . it &apos;s everywhere .
&quot; bloody billionaire beach battle &quot; ?
do the police really think daniel killed tyler ?
of course not .
well , dad took the helicopter into the city .
when it returns , i &apos;ve made sure
the best defense attorney in manhattan is gonna be on board .
ashley , could you please get me an aspirin ?
of course .
i think her time would be better
spent trying to get that photograph taken down .
okay , i &apos;ll call nolan ross
and see if we can have access to his tech team .
and you should get to bed , young lady .
get some rest .
the next few days are gonna be challenging .
i &apos;m only here to pick up clothes .
i &apos;m going back to declan &apos;s .
sweetheart , we need you to stay here .
your brother &apos;s in real trouble ,
and we need to stay together as a family .
your mother &apos;s right .
we need to present a united front .
fine .
i &apos;ll move back in when you do .
that &apos;s what i thought .
you must be exhausted .
hey , sammy .
you should take him for a walk .
i will .
just gonna change first .
where you been ?
oh , jeez . dec.
you scared the hell outta me .
what are you doing in here ?
i &apos;ve been wondering what happened to you .
i thought you sailed off to haiti .
my engine crapped out .
i figured that when i saw the &quot; amanda &quot; in her slip
an hour ago .
so where you been all this time ?
it &apos;s 5 : 00 in the morning , man .
why aren &apos;t you sleeping ?
well , it &apos;s been a crazy night .
tyler was murdered .
tyler ?
me and charlotte found him .
and daniel pops up from a dune , covered in blood .
that &apos;s-- that &apos;s insane .
are-- are you okay ?
fine .
charlotte &apos;s a wreck , though .
she told the cops that she saw some guy in a hoodie
on the beach by tyler &apos;s body .
what about you ?
i was too far away .
i didn &apos;t get a good look at his face .
i &apos;m gonna crash .
what are you doing ?
looking for answers .
what is this ?
i don &apos;t know . it must belong to the previous owner .
how did you--
tyler told me you &apos;ve been playing me ,
that you had secrets hidden underneath the floorboards .
daniel ,
tyler was crazy .
he was a liar .
he held us at gunpoint .
you &apos;re right . i &apos;m sorry .
no .
you don &apos;t need to apologize .
you &apos;re injured , you &apos;re traumatized .
i love you , daniel .
i &apos;m gonna be by your side no matter what .
come on . you need to get some sleep .
as of now ,
daniel hasn &apos;t been charged with anything .
all we know is ,
tyler barrol appears to have been shot to death
and daniel was found unconscious at the scene
with some blood on him .
everyone &apos;s waiting on the coroner &apos;s report
as well as the results from your fingerprint
and gunshot residue test .
until those come back ,
we won &apos;t know what we &apos;re up against .
mr. brooks ,
i want to tell you how grateful we are
that you &apos;ve agreed to represent daniel
and that you can count on my husband and i
to work as a team .
where is your husband ?
mr. brooks was kind enough not to question your absence ,
but i am not feeling so indulgent .
i haven &apos;t slept . i &apos;m tired .
and i didn &apos;t want our history clouding the room .
246 fatalities
in the bombing of flight 197 .
the final death toll will likely surge
to include the many unaccounted for ...
conrad , are you all right ?
on the ground .
a homegrown group of violent radicals ...
what is it ?
calling themselves the americon initiative ...
i &apos;ve made a terrible , terrible mistake .
the president , awakened last night to news ...
uh , you know the plane that went down , flight 197 ?
i &apos;m responsible .
what on earth are you talking about ?
that group that claimed responsibility for the bombing ,
i was laundering money for them .
conrad .
the investigation &apos;s gonna tie back to the company .
i &apos;m gonna go to prison for the rest of my life ,
if i &apos;m lucky .
they &apos;re gonna freeze all of our assets ,
and you &apos;re gonna have to raise daniel alone
under a cloud of disgrace .
life as we know it , victoria ,
is over .
no matter how much we try to escape our past ,
we seem destined to repeat it .
like it or not , we are in this together ,
again .
good to see you , old timer .
good boy .
jack .
shouldn &apos;t you be on a boat
halfway to haiti right now ?
yeah , well , my engine had other ideas .
you okay ?
yeah , i &apos;m fine .
it &apos;s daniel i &apos;m worried about .
the police were questioning him pretty hard .
do they have any other suspects ?
i don &apos;t know . they &apos;re not really keeping us in the loop .
how &apos;s declan ?
finding tyler &apos;s body must have been pretty awful .
yeah , he &apos;s , uh , he &apos;s playing it cool , but ...
i &apos;m not buying it .
you haven &apos;t heard from amanda , by any chance , have you ?
no .
still no luck getting ahold of her ?
no , her phone &apos;s disconnected .
anyway , thank you
for looking after sammy .
anytime .
i need to see what happened on jack &apos;s boat .
he never left town .
what ? he should be down around the outer banks by now .
try my back porch .
no , i swear , he left the harbor .
i saw him or ...
at least , uh , shamu did .
see ? what did i tell you ?
jack !
jack , wait !
amanda ?
what are you doing here ?
mea culpa , babe .
jack said he had engine trouble
and the last time he saw amanda was last week .
why would he lie to me ?
probably because he &apos;s covering up another one of her messes .
talk to him . see if you can find out why amanda came back .
and where she &apos;s been hiding , right ?
especially that .
hey , charlotte , what are you doing ?
i barely slept last night .
my head is pounding .
you &apos;ve no idea what these past few days have been like for me ,
finding out david clarke is my father ,
and now daniel getting wrapped up
in tyler &apos;s murder investigation ,
knowing how close we probably came to getting killed , too ...
by that creepy guy in the hoodie .
uh , well , maybe you should call that shrink again .
you said she really helped last time .
talking &apos;s overrated .
and taking pills isn &apos;t ?
were you high last night ?
come on , charlotte .
you &apos;re supposed to be the smart one here .
and you &apos;re supposed to be on my side .
where are you going ?
i &apos;ve had enough interrogation for one weekend .
we should &apos;ve gone to paris .
i know .
i &apos;m so sorry .
hamptons police department .
just a minute .
they &apos;re gonna fry me , aren &apos;t they ?
no . no .
no , i &apos;m not gonna let that happen , okay ?
ms. thorne , hamptons police department .
okay ?
ms. thorne , we have a warrant for daniel &apos;s arrest .
open the door now .
that &apos;s him .
daniel grayson ,
you &apos;re under arrest for the murder of tyler barrol .
you don &apos;t have to--
stay back .
daniel . take your hands off my son !
daniel &apos;s fingerprints were found on emily &apos;s gun .
he handled that gun a dozen times .
his hands were tested positive for gunshot residue .
the blood splatter on his tuxedo
was the same type as tyler &apos;s .
in a political climate like this ,
the d.a. goes first @-@ degree murder .
all right , it &apos;s time you told us
everything that happened on that beach , son .
it &apos;s okay .
do it .
tyler was talking crazy , waving the gun around .
we had a struggle , and i managed to get ahold of it .
and then he charged at me .
keep going .
so i fired .
three times ?
once , then i blacked out .
next thing i remember was my mother calling my name .
tyler was shot three times .
once in the chest , twice the back .
i didn &apos;t shoot tyler in the back .
how do you know ?
i thought you said you blacked out .
when you and tyler struggled ...
where did he hit you ?
right here , on the side of the head .
there &apos;s a hematoma on the back of your head .
that &apos;s a hard spot to reach if you &apos;re fighting face @-@ to @-@ face .
we can use it to float the theory
there was a third person on the beach
that knocked you out ,
set you up .
you &apos;re rich . who hates you--
disgruntled investors , hostile competitors ?
amanda clarke .
ah . great .
where can we find her ?
mrs. grayson . mrs. grayson .
how does it feel to have your son
facing life in prison ?
mr. grayson , what affect will a murder trial
have on grayson global stock ?
mrs. grayson .
the grayson family have no comment ...
do you think your son did it ?
except to say that daniel is innocent of the charges
and they &apos;re sure that justice will be served .
amanda ?
victoria .
come on in .
well , when you and daniel decided to get married ,
you probably never would &apos;ve dreamed that your engagement
would have included a ... murder investigation .
i don &apos;t think anyone could imagine
something so horrible .
well , under the circumstances ,
i would understand if you were reevaluating
the future of your relationship .
so ...
this is my engagement present to the two of you .
you want me to open it now ?
no .
i want you to hold on to it .
and i need to know that you &apos;ll stand by daniel &apos;s side
no matter how rough the road gets .
if you abandon him ,
it &apos;ll send a very public message about his innocence .
honestly , that never even crossed my mind .
emily .
victoria .
why did you come back to this house
when we were all at the police station ?
i knew that they would take daniel &apos;s suit .
i wanted to make sure that he had a change of clothing
for when they did .
well , that was quick thinking .
maybe your time in the juvenile detention facility
will end up being an asset in daniel &apos;s court case .
i got a problem and i don &apos;t know where else to go .
uh , oh , welcome to the cone of silence .
you know what this is ?
a ... wire receipt for $ 5 million .
someone sent it from the southampton trust
to a small bank outside of montreal .
i called the bank , but i couldn &apos;t get &apos; em
to give me any information on who it came from .
was it you ?
no .
then it must have been the graysons .
i think this had something to do with what happened on the beach .
oh , really , &apos; cause you want to get wrapped up in a murder investigation ?
i already am .
the receipt was in amanda &apos;s jacket .
i thought you said she left .
she showed up the other night as i was heading out .
we were all set to go to haiti , and she took off .
nolan ...
nolan , i followed her to the beach .
i spent hours looking for her .
i @-@ i--driving around .
she was gone .
probably straight to canada
to collect the $ 5 million .
you asked for my advice
so i &apos;m not gonna sugarcoat it .
throw away the receipt and let it go .
and while you &apos;re at it ,
why don &apos;t you let amanda go , too ?
i can &apos;t do that .
jack !
this is emily . leave a message .
call me ...
asap .
you &apos;re gonna want to sit down for this one .
do you believe daniel killed tyler ?
of course not .
the stuff they &apos;re saying about him online ,
it &apos;s like they &apos;re talking about a completely different person .
they are .
i just wish there was something i could do to help him .
is this what it was like for you when you found out
david clarke did all those hideous things ?
do you think about him every time you look at me ?
charlotte .
i want to know about him , mom ,
what kind of person he was when he was with you .
it feels like you &apos;re a million miles away .
if only .
you know , my aunt charlotte has a farm in kansas--
50 acres .
we could pack our bags and leave tonight .
i can &apos;t leave daniel with conrad .
well , we can pack two bags , bring the kids with us .
besides , when conrad finds out about us ,
i &apos;m gonna be finished on wall street .
i &apos;m gonna be packing my bags regardless .
well , that &apos;s why no one can find out about us , david .
i &apos;ve lived that life before ,
and i can &apos;t live it again .
well ... what about love ?
can you live without that ?
i promise to tell you everything one day ,
but today is not the day .
i need you to think hard about that person you saw on the beach .
you might remember things that you don &apos;t realize .
do you understand me ?
your brother &apos;s life may depend on it .
i got your message . what &apos;s so important ?
jack found the wire transfer receipt in amanda &apos;s jacket .
did you find out how much amanda told him ?
it doesn &apos;t sound like she had a lot of time
to chat before she took off .
you ever notice how ,
whenever you want her to leave ,
girlfriend keeps popping up
like the homicidal stripper version of whac @-@ a @-@ mole ,
but whenever you need to find her ,
she vanishes ?
and manages to pull jack even deeper into trouble .
ms. thorne ?
i &apos;ll call you back .
mr. brooks .
i apologize for the ambush ,
but i wanted to speak to you alone .
to be perfectly blunt ,
the more dirt i have on daniel ,
the better prepared i &apos;ll be when the fur starts flying .
ah . looking for skeletons .
skeletons , addictions ,
secret relationships ,
proclivities .
wow . you are blunt .
your fiance &apos;s facing a murder charge .
this isn &apos;t the time for subtlety .
victoria is convinced amanda clarke had something to do
with what happened on that beach .
have you had any run @-@ ins with her ?
i just met her this summer .
she used to live in this house , actually .
she came by once
looking for childhood memories .
do you believe she hates the graysons enough
to frame daniel for murder ?
i think you &apos;d have to find her
and ask her .
all i know is ,
she &apos;s a very troubled girl .
i already have my investigators on it .
thank you , ms. thorne .
mr. brooks .
since we &apos;re being candid ...
i think there is something you should know .
about daniel or amanda ?
about the graysons .
i understand daniel got into a few scrapes
over the last few years .
like anyone his age ,
he &apos;s had a few youthful indiscretions .
and what role did you and conrad play in those indiscretions ?
i &apos;m not sure i follow you .
did you honestly believe i wouldn &apos;t find out
you paid off a judge last summer
to downgrade daniel &apos;s d.u.i. and reckless endangerment charges ?
where on earth did you hear this ?
i told him .
i thought you were on daniel &apos;s side .
or was that just a ruse ?
as far as i &apos;m concerned , emily is the only one here
who seems to have daniel &apos;s best interests at heart .
no one loves my son more than i do .
what if the prosecution
had blindsided me with that mid @-@ trial ?
we were very discreet .
that girl was almost killed .
her brother took a 9 @-@ iron to daniel &apos;s aston martin .
many people know exactly what you did .
everyone &apos;s looking for a member
of the 1 % to smack down ,
and daniel is tailor @-@ made to take that fall .
so unless you &apos;re ready to level with me ,
i might as well be up at shinnecock hills
practicing my backswing .
of course , mr. brooks .
from here on out , you &apos;ll have
complete and utter candor from both of us .
do you have any leads on amanda clarke ?
still working on it .
did you know that she dated that young man
who runs the stowaway tavern in montauk ?
his name is jack porter .
i &apos;ll pay him a visit .
but my more immediate concern
is the security tapes from the party .
what now ?
apparently , they were tampered with .
kept on a 3 @-@ minute loop
for the bulk of the evening .
and how does that impact us ?
the prosecution will make it look like
daniel engineered it
so no one would see him kill tyler .
how long have you been working for takeda ?
what are you talking about ?
i know you disabled the security cameras at the party .
it &apos;s got takeda &apos;s stamp all over it .
do i really need to kick your ass again ?
how did he recruit you ?
okay .
he cozied up to me
at the investors &apos; shindig earlier this summer .
he wanted me to look out for you .
why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
because he told me not to ,
and he can be very convincing .
i &apos;m sorry , ems .
no , you know what ? it &apos;s my fault .
i should never have brought you so deep into this .
well , it &apos;s a little late to put that genie
back in the infinity box .
anyway , we have more pressing problems
than your loyalty issues .
the graysons are on a mission to find amanda .
until they do , they &apos;re gonna be looking for a fall guy
closer to home .
jack .
ms. davenport , how are the graysons holding up
during this very difficult time ?
they &apos;re devastated .
daniel grayson &apos;s arrest is a terrible injustice .
the evidence will show
that not only did daniel not commit the crime ,
but that there was another person on the beach that night
who had both the motive and the means
to murder tyler barrol and frame daniel for the crime .
the grayson family are offering a $ 100,000 reward
for any information leading to the conviction of the killer .
charlotte .
is everything okay ?
this is the prettiest spot on the beach .
it &apos;s so peaceful .
yeah , i really lucked out .
hard to believe i grew up with a sister right next door
and i never had any idea .
do you think she knew the truth this whole summer ?
my mother thinks she did .
there &apos;s just so much i want to ask her
about her life , her father ...
our father .
but chances are , that won &apos;t happen now .
is that why you &apos;ve been taking those pills ?
you know ...
jack and amanda came over one day and ...
they told me that your father built this swing .
he couldn &apos;t have been all bad .
hey , jack , you got a sec ?
yeah . what &apos;s up ?
do you remember when i was 9,
and me and jimmy smithson were playing frisbee in the bar .
and i broke dad &apos;s favorite beer sign ?
the neon one with the clock ?
yeah , and dad went ballistic .
you know , i @-@ i &apos;d never seen somebody actually turn purple .
so i ran up to my room , started packing a bag .
you know , figuring i was gonna run away .
and you told him you did it ,
even though he grounded you
and wouldn &apos;t let you go on that camping trip to the adirondacks .
dec--
no .
you are the most stand @-@ up guy i know .
i &apos;ve seen you take the heat for other people
over and over again ,
but you got a lot more to lose here
than a couple of days in the mountains .
and i @-@ i don &apos;t care who you &apos;re protecting or why .
but as of now , i &apos;m gonna start protecting you .
single malt .
neat .
coming up .
where &apos;s that pretty girl who tends bar ?
amanda , is it ?
our business is seasonal .
when the summer ends , people move on to the next gig .
happens every year .
you two were dating , right ?
you ask a lot of questions .
benjamin brooks .
i represent daniel drayson .
i have another question for you .
where were you saturday night ?
i was starting to sail to haiti .
i was getting ready to help with the rebuilding there .
aren &apos;t you the altruist ? what stopped you ?
engine trouble .
that &apos;s a shame .
pretty soon , fall will be here . it &apos;ll be too rough a trip .
should &apos;ve left when you had the chance .
let me know if you hear from amanda .
oh , i can have your boat fixed and ready to go by nightfall .
running away is not gonna solve anything .
and i gotta find amanda before the graysons do .
and how are you gonna do that ?
i don &apos;t know yet .
does it matter to you if your clients are guilty ?
i never ask .
cynical .
the last thing i need
is to have my judgment clouded .
and in 20 years , i haven &apos;t lost a case ,
so if ain &apos;t broke ...
what &apos;s your take on all this ?
i think daniel shot tyler .
and i think he &apos;s gonna get away with it .
and yet you continue to work for the graysons .
i come from a town called croydon ,
just outside of london .
population--no one cares and dropping .
i want more out of life than planning parties
and making sure other people &apos;s lives run smoothly ,
but for now ...
it &apos;s my job .
the camera sure loves you .
you play your cards right ,
you can parlay daniel &apos;s trial into a whole new career .
but then ...
i think you already know that .
looks like you could use some company .
two months ago ,
we were being heralded in &quot; the times . &quot; as a golden couple ,
and now look at us .
one child arrested for murder ,
and the other can &apos;t look at us without contempt ,
divorced but living under the same roof .
at least it &apos;s a 20,000 @-@ square @-@ foot roof .
it &apos;s not like we &apos;ll be tripping over each other .
24,000 .
oh . how the hell did we get here ?
mm . i don &apos;t know .
i believe it &apos;s called the domino effect .
you know , one move begets another ,
and then before you know it ...
they all fall down .
i &apos;m worried .
jail is no place for a boy like daniel .
there is a perception
in this part of the world
that power and money exert undue influence .
i want it clear--
in my courtroom ,
justice has no price tag .
i have carefully examined the wealth of forensic evidence
linking daniel grayson to the crime scene
and taken into consideration the grayson family &apos;s
unlimited resources
as well as private planes .
given the serious nature of this crime ,
i hereby deny bail ...
oh , my god
for daniel grayson ...
and order him to be remanded to the maximum security
correctional facility on rikers island while he awaits trial .
daniel . daniel .
bailiff , would you please remove the defendant ?
you gotta do something .
do the graysons see the judge &apos;s ruling
as a huge defeat ?
the grayson family have the greatest respect
for the court &apos;s decision regarding daniel &apos;s bail .
but they do view this as a minor setback ,
and one they &apos;re sure the justice system will remedy
as quickly as possible .
i &apos;d also like--
you &apos;re not going anywhere , are you ?
no , declan needs me .
oh , kudos for the family values .
but you &apos;re making a colossal mistake .
does this mean you don &apos;t want a drink ?
make it a double .
it &apos;s gonna be a long fall .
nolcorp , i.t. department ,
hey , it &apos;s nolan .
those photos we pulled down for the graysons ,
i need you to find out where they originated .
adversity creates unexpected alliances ...
but treaties of this nature
seldom form with an equality of power .
well , here she is--
the media &apos;s new it girl .
mm . it &apos;s quite an upgrade
from the queen &apos;s favorite worker bee .
i take it you didn &apos;t summon me here for an autograph .
i &apos;m all for a meteoric rise , ash ,
but , uh , i followed a hunch ,
and sourced the scandal pics
that are blowing up the internet .
and guess where the trail ends .
who else knows ?
just us ...
for now .
loyalties forged in apprehension and mistrust ...
are tenuous at best ...
easily broken when held up
to the unforgiving light of the truth .
but in the darkness of our most desperate hours ...
it &apos;s often these loyalties that lend us the strength
to do what we know must be done .
you should &apos;ve heeded my warning .
what did you do ?
what happened on the beach ?
the boy was going to expose you .
you won &apos;t get away with this , tyler .
sure i will ,
but emily won &apos;t .
no !
stay back !
maybe you should call emily first .
ask her permission to pull the trigger .
she &apos;s a wolf in sheep &apos;s clothing , you idiot .
and you &apos;re just a helpless little lamb
headed for the slaughter .
please . help me .
no !
but there were others .
the girl you call amanda .
she has been taken care of .
amanda !
and then ...
jack .
the other boy you have feelings for .
you cannot save them both .
a conflicted heart feeds on doubt and confusion .
it will make you question your path ...
your tactics ...
your motives .
when you stare ahead and darkness is all you see ,
only reason and determination
