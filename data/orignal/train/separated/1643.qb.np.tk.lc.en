watch this , it &apos;s really cool .
call leonard hofstadter .
did you say : &quot; call helen boxleitner &quot; ?
no .
call leonard hofstadter .
did you say : &quot; call temple beth seder &quot; ?
no .
here , let me try it .
call mcflono mcfilooloon
calling rajesh koothrappali .
oh , it &apos;s very impressive .
and a little racist .
if we &apos;re all through playing &quot; mock the flawed technology , &quot;
can we get on with halo night ?
we were supposed to start at 8 : 00 . it is now 8 : 06 .
so we &apos;ll start now .
yes , first we have to decide
if those lost six minutes will be coming out of game time , bathroom time or the pizza break .
we could split it two , two and two .
if we &apos;re having anchovies on the pizza , we can &apos;t take it out of bathroom time .
oh , what fresh hell is this ?
oh , hey , penny . come on in .
hey , guys .
see a penny , pick her up , and all the day you &apos;ll have good luck .
no , you won &apos;t .
uh , can i hide out here for a while ?
sure . what &apos;s going on ?
well , there &apos;s this girl i know from back in nebraska , christy .
anyway , she called me up , and she &apos;s like , &quot; hey , how &apos;s california ? &quot;
and i &apos;m like , &quot; awesome , &quot; &apos; cause , you know , it &apos;s not nebraska .
and the next thing i know she &apos;s invited herself out here to stay with me .
8 : 08 .
anyway , she got here today and she &apos;s just been in my apartment yakity yakking about every guy she slept with in omaha ,
which is basically every guy in omaha ,
and washing the sluttiest collection of underwear you have ever seen in my bathroom sink .
is she doing it one thong at a time , or does she throw it all in ...
like some sort of erotic bouillabaisse ?
he really needs to dial it down .
i know .
so if you don &apos;t like this christy , why are you letting her stay ?
well , she was engaged to my cousin while she was sleeping with my brother ,
so she &apos;s kind of family .
i apologize for my earlier outburst .
who needs halo , when we can be regaled with the delightfully folksy tale of the whore of omaha ?
oh , i don &apos;t think she &apos;s a whore .
no , yeah , she &apos;s definitely a whore .
i mean , she has absolutely no standards .
this one time she was at ...
where &apos;s howard ?
bonjour , mademoiselle .
i understand you &apos;re new in town .
oh , good grief .
aw , i cannot believe christy let howard into my apartment .
and i cannot believe people pay for horoscopes ,
but on a more serious note , it &apos;s 8 : 13 and we &apos;re still not playing halo .
okay , fine . we &apos;ll just play one @-@ on @-@ one until he gets back .
one @-@ on @-@ one ? we don &apos;t play one @-@ on @-@ one .
we play teams , not one @-@ on @-@ one . one @-@ on @-@ one .
well , the only way we can play teams at this point is if we cut raj in half .
oh sure , cut the foreigner in half . there &apos;s a billion more where he came from .
hey , if you guys need a fourth , i &apos;ll play .
great idea .
no .
the wheel was a great idea , relativity was a great idea .
this is a notion , and a rather sucky one at that .
why ?
why ?
oh , penny , penny , penny .
oh , what , what , what ?
this is a complex battle simulation with a steep learning curve .
there are myriad weapons , vehicles and strategies to master ,
not to mention an extremely intricate backstory .
oh cool . whose head did i just blow off ?
mine .
okay , i got this . lock and load , boys .
it &apos;s the only way we can play teams .
yes , but whoever &apos;s her partner will be hamstrung by her lack of experience ,
and not to mention the fact ...
there goes your head again .
okay , it &apos;s not good sportsmanship to shoot somebody who &apos;s just re @-@ spawned .
you need to to give them a chance to ... now , come on !
raj , raj ! she &apos;s got me cornered.cover me !
cover this , suckers !
penny , you are on fire !
yes , and so is sheldon .
okay , that &apos;s it .
i don &apos;t know how , but she is cheating .
no one can be that attractive and this skilled at a video game .
wait , wait , sheldon , come back .
you forgot something .
what ?
this plasma grenade .
look , it &apos;s raining you .
you laugh now-- you just wait until you need tech support .
gosh , he &apos;s kind of a sore loser , isn &apos;t he ?
well , to be fair , he &apos;s also a rather unpleasant winner .
well , it &apos;s been fun .
you know , penny , we make such a good team .
maybe we could enter a couple of halo tournaments sometime .
or we could just have a life .
i guess for you that &apos;s an option .
good night , leonard .
good night .
as usual , nice talking to you , raj .
what do you suppose she meant by that ?
she &apos;s an enigma , raj .
and another thing-- there &apos;s a certain ethic to the game , penny , a well
established ...
she &apos;s gone , sheldon .
well , she could have said good @-@ bye .
okay , i have a problem .
it &apos;s called carpal tunnel syndrome , and quite frankly you deserve it .
what &apos;s wrong ?
well , um , howard and christy are ...
kind of hooking up in my bedroom .
are you sure ?
look , i grew up on a farm , okay ?
from what i heard , they &apos;re either having sex or howard &apos;s caught in a milking machine .
do you mind if i stay here tonight ?
no , take the couch , or my bed .
i just got new pillows . hypo @-@ allergenic .
the couch is good .
hold that thought . leonard , a moment .
let me guess . you have a problem with this .
where do i begin ?
it &apos;s up to you . crazy person &apos;s choice .
well , first , we don &apos;t have houseguests .
frankly , if i could afford the rent , i &apos;d ask you to leave .
your friendship means a lot to me as well . what else ?
well ...
our earthquake supplies . we have a two @-@ man , two @-@ day kit .
so ?
so if there &apos;s an earthquake and the three of us are trapped here ,
we could be out of food by tomorrow afternoon .
i &apos;m sorry , are you suggesting that if we let penny stay we might succumb to cannibalism ?
no one ever thinks it &apos;ll happen until it does .
penny , if you promise not to chew the flesh off our bones while we sleep , you can stay .
what ?
he &apos;s engaging in reductio ad absurdum .
it &apos;s the logical fallacy of extending someone &apos;s argument to ridiculous proportions
and then criticizing the result .
and i do not appreciate it .
i &apos;ll get you a blanket and a pillow .
okay , well , since i &apos;m obviously being ignored here , let &apos;s go over the morning schedule .
i use the bathroom from 7 : 00 to 7 : 20 .
plan your ablutions and bodily functions accordingly .
how am i supposed to plan my bodily functions ?
i suggest no liquids after 11 : 00 p.m.
here you go .
thanks , leonard .
wrong .
i &apos;m listening .
your head goes on the other end .
why ?
it &apos;s culturally universal .
a bed , even a temporary bed ,
is always oriented with the headboard away from the door .
it serves the ancient imperative of protecting oneself against marauders .
i &apos;ll risk it .
anything else should i know ?
yes , if you use my toothbrush , i &apos;ll jump out that window .
please don &apos;t come to my funeral . have a good night .
sorry about that .
that &apos;s okay .
fyi-- his toothbrush is the red one in the plexiglas case under the uv light .
got it .
well , sleep tight .
thanks .
funny expression , &quot; sleep tight . &quot;
it refers to the early construction of beds
which featured a mattress suspended on interlocking ropes , which would occasionally ...
sleep tight .
what are you doing ?
every saturday since we &apos;ve lived in this apartment i have awakened at 6 : 15,
poured myself a bowl of cereal ,
added a quarter cup of two percent milk ,
sat on this end of this couch ,
turned on bbc america , and watched doctor who .
penny &apos;s still sleeping .
every saturday since we &apos;ve lived in this apartment i have awakened at 6 : 15,
poured myself a bowl of cereal ...
i know , i know .
look , you have a tv in your room .
why don &apos;t you just have breakfast in bed ?
because i am neither an invalid , nor a woman celebrating mother &apos;s day .
what time is it ?
almost 6 : 30 .
i slept all day ?
no , it &apos;s 6 : 30 in the morning .
what the hell is your problem ?
okay , this cereal has lost all its molecular integrity .
i now have a bowl of shredded wheat paste .
hola , nerd @-@ migos .
why do you people hate sleep ?
are you wearing my robe ?
oh , yeah . sorry , i &apos;ll have it cleaned .
that &apos;s okay , keep it .
where &apos;s christy ?
in the shower .
oh , by the way , where did you get that loofah mitt ?
yours reaches places that mine just won &apos;t .
you used my loofah ?
more precisely , we used your loofah .
i exfoliated her brains out .
you can keep that , too .
well , then we &apos;ll probably need to talk about your stuffed bear collection .
howard ?
in here , milady !
there &apos;s my little engine that could .
chugga @-@ ghugga , chugga @-@ chugga ...
well , there &apos;s one beloved children &apos;s book i &apos;ll never read again .
hi . christy .
leonard .
i &apos;m sheldon .
right . you &apos;re howard &apos;s entourage .
uh , so , christy , what are your plans ?
oh , well , howard said he &apos;d take me shopping in beverly hills .
yeah , no , i meant plans to find someplace to live .
you know , other than with me .
not that i don &apos;t love having you , but it &apos;s ...
it &apos;s a little crowded .
you know , penny , you &apos;re always welcome to stay with us .
oh , terrific .
now we &apos;re running a cute little b &amp; b.
let me offer a little outside @-@ the @-@ box thinking here .
why doesn &apos;t christy stay with me ?
for one thing , you live with your mother .
i do not .
my mother lives with me .
well , then it &apos;s all settled .
christy will stay with howard , penny can go back to her apartment ,
and i &apos;ll watch the last 24 minutes of doctor who .
although at this point , it &apos;s more like doctor why bother ?
sheldon , you just can &apos;t dictate ...
no more talking ! everybody go !
so what do you say ?
want to repair to casa wolowitz ?
what is that , like a mexican deli ?
i &apos;m sorry , i should have mentioned this earlier .
my last name is wolowitz .
oh , that &apos;s so cool .
my first jew .
i imagine there aren &apos;t very many kosher cornhuskers .
cornhusker : 美国内布拉斯加州居民的绰号 ( 意为剥玉米皮的乡巴佬 )
but you &apos;re still taking me shopping , right ?
anything you want .
okay , i &apos;ll go pack my stuff .
when they perfect human cloning , i &apos;m going to order 12 of those .
howard , can &apos;t you see she &apos;s using you ?
who cares ? last night , she pulled off her blouse and i wept .
look , howard , i know her . okay ?
she &apos;ll have sex with anyone , as long as they keep buying her things .
really ?
yeah .
yay !
if you &apos;ll excuse me , i have some bar mitzvah bonds to cash .
i &apos;m sorry , we cannot do this without wolowitz .
we can &apos;t order chinese food without wolowitz ?
let me walk you through it .
our standard order is : the steamed dumpling appetizer , general tso &apos;s chicken ,
beef with broccoli , shrimp with lobster sauce and vegetable lo mein .
do you see the problem ?
i see a problem .
our entire order is predicated on four dumplings
and four entrees divided amongst four people .
so , we &apos;ll just order three entrees .
fine . what do you want to eliminate ?
and who gets the extra dumpling ?
we could cut it into thirds .
then it &apos;s no longer a dumpling .
once you cut it open it is , at best , a very small open @-@ faced sandwich .
hi , fellas .
oh , where &apos;s your annoying little friend who thinks he speaks mandarin ?
he &apos;s putting his needs ahead of the collective good .
where he comes from , that &apos;s punishable by death .
i come from sacramento .
can we get an order of dumplings but with three instead of four ?
no substitutions .
this isn &apos;t a substitution . it &apos;s a reduction .
okay.no reductions .
fine .
uh , bring us three orders of dumplings .
that &apos;s 12 . we &apos;ll each have four .
that works .
no . if we fill up on dumplings , we need to eliminate another entree .
no eliminations .
if we have extra , we &apos;ll just take the leftovers home .
and divide it how ?
i &apos;m telling you , we cannot do this without wolowitz .
wolowitz is with his new girlfriend .
if you had let me invite penny , then you would have had your fourth .
have you seen penny eat chinese food ?
she uses a fork and she double @-@ dips her egg rolls .
we don &apos;t order egg rolls .
exactly , but we &apos;d have to if she was here !
can we please make a decision ?
not only are there children starving in india ,
there &apos;s an indian starving right here .
there &apos;s an idea . why don &apos;t we just go out for indian food ?
you &apos;re nice boys .
tell you what i &apos;m going to do .
i &apos;m going to bring you the four dumplings .
when i &apos;m walking over to the table ,
maybe i get bumped , one of the dumplings fall to the floor .
no one has to know .
i &apos;ll know .
how about soup ?
yeah , we can always divide soup .
what about the wontons ?
hey , guys , what &apos;s up ?
it &apos;s halo night .
yeah ? okay .
so ?
well , with wolowitz spending all of his time with your friend christy ...
she &apos;s not my friend .
friends do not get their friends &apos; care bears all sweaty .
right . anyway , uh , with wolowitz occupied elsewhere ,
we had something we wanted to ask you .
sheldon ?
yes .
penny ...
we would very much appreciate
it if you would be the fourth member of our halo team .
i don &apos;t think i need to tell you what an honor this is .
oh , that &apos;s so sweet , but i &apos;m going out dancing with a girlfriend .
you can &apos;t go out ; it &apos;s halo night .
well , for penny , it &apos;s dancing night .
you go dancing every wednesday ?
no . then that &apos;s not &quot; dancing night . &quot;
look , why don &apos;t i play with you guys tomorrow ?
tonight is halo night .
it &apos;s like talking to a wall .
all right , now , sheldon , you and i are about to have a problem .
sheldon , remember , we role @-@ played this .
yes , but you didn &apos;t portray her as completely irrational .
all right , fellas , i gotta go .
but good luck .
maybe we should &apos;ve asked if we could go dancing with her and her girlfriend .
okay , assuming we could dance-- which we can &apos;t--
there are three of us and two of them .
so ?
it &apos;s the chinese restaurant all over again .
i assure you that cutting a dumpling in thirds is child &apos;s play
compared with three men each attempting to dance with 67 % of a woman .
oh , for god &apos;s sakes , sheldon , you &apos;re driving me crazy !
your anger is not with me , sir , but with basic mathematics .
no . i &apos;m pretty sure my anger is with you .
what &apos;s happening to us ? we &apos;re falling apart .
who are you calling ?
the only man who can restore any semblance of balance to our universe .
hi , this is howard wolowitz .
and this is christy vanderbelt .
we can &apos;t get to the phone right now because we &apos;re having sex !
you &apos;re not going to put that on your message , are you ?
nah , i &apos;m just kidding . i &apos;ll re @-@ record it .
sheldon , think this through .
you &apos;re going to ask howard to choose between sex and halo .
no , i &apos;m going to ask him to choose between sex and halo three .
as far as i know , sex has not been upgraded
to include hi @-@ def graphics and enhanced weapon systems .
you &apos;re right , all sex has is nudity , orgasms and human contact .
my point .
i &apos;m just saying , you can take the damn plastic off the couch once in a while !
why , so you and howard can hump on it ?
ladies , ladies , i &apos;m sure there &apos;s a middle ground .
shut up , howard !
you know what , you guys talk .
i &apos;m gonna take my scooter out for a little spin .
you happy ? you drove your own son out of the house .
hey , what are you guys doing here ?
it &apos;s halo night .
he &apos;s not a man , he &apos;s a putz !
and don &apos;t you take that tone with me , you gold digger !
what &apos;d you call me ?
you heard me !
and i &apos;ll tell you something else , you &apos;re barking up the wrong tree .
&apos;cause as long as you &apos;re around , howard is out of the will !
you know what ? i got better offers .
i &apos;m outta here .
that &apos;s right .
go back to babylon , you whore !
so , halo night , huh ?
i thought she was the whore of omaha .
sheldon , you got him in your sights ! fire !
he &apos;s charging his plasma rifle !
i can &apos;t shoot now .
i &apos;m cloaking !
now , raj ! kill sheldon !
i can &apos;t see him !
that &apos;s why they call it cloaking , dead man !
start throwing grenades !
i &apos;m all out !
hey , guys . my friends and i got tired of dancing ,
so we came over to have sex with you .
raj , hop in the tank !
we said no tanks !
there are no rules in hell !
son of a bitch . med pack !
i need a med pack !
told ya .
there &apos;s a sniper . use your rocket launcher !
all i &apos;ve got is a needler and i &apos;m all out of ammo !
and now you &apos;re out of life .
why &apos;d you hit pause ?
i thought i heard ... something .
what ?
