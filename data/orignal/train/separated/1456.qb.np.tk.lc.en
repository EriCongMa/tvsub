oh phil , honey you &apos;re still up .
ok . how &apos;s this sound ?
mitchell , i love you very much ,
not only love you but i admire you
and someday i hope to ...
are you firing him or proposing to him ?
honey , this was supposed to be a part @-@ time job .
he was gonna be done in the summer anyway .
just be direct .
i should have warned him .
how do you tell someone
they have a reputation for being lazy ?
mitchell ? lazy ?
yeah . yeah . he handed in a couple of contracts late ,
but i didn &apos;t want to say anything
because he &apos;s practically doing this for free .
i can &apos;t do this !
this isn &apos;t the face of a cold @-@ blooded hatchet man .
will you do it ?
oh , i &apos;m sorry . did we wake you up ?
no , i was up .
i &apos;m worried about tomorrow .
my art teacher acts like i don &apos;t exist ,
but i have one last chance
to impress him at our year @-@ end art fair .
a few students are doing living versions of famous paintings .
i &apos;ve chosen this one , and i &apos;m using my own family .
brilliant , right ?
when i told him , he said , &quot; that &apos;s nice , alice . &quot;
it &apos;s been a year .
alice ? really ?
honey , do you think you &apos;re nervous
because you &apos;ve got a little crush on mr. jarvis ?
no .
are you sure ?
because i &apos;ve seen the way you look at him--
sounds like you &apos;re the one with the crush ! mm .
i &apos;ve just never had a teacher not like me before .
well , ms. davis . mm .
please . she &apos;s a gym teacher .
she is to teaching what dr. seuss is to medicine .
and to think she didn &apos;t like you .
you ? what &apos;s your problem ?
nothing . i &apos;m just excited for tomorrow .
i &apos;m getting a medal at school
because i put out a fire .
maybe that &apos;s what i should be when i grow up ...
a professional medal @-@ getter .
luke , what happened ?
i don &apos;t know .
i was just walking by and i smelled flames .
i was there .
i don &apos;t like this .
we &apos;re not supposed to be in here .
just keep a lookout !
we &apos;re ten seconds away from creating luketonium .
oh , crap !
look what you did !
luke , what happened ?
i don &apos;t know .
i was just walking by and i smelled flames .
okay , guys , you &apos;re gonna be dragging tomorrow
if you don &apos;t go to bed right now . let &apos;s go . go .
fine . come on , alice .
i &apos;ll be up in a minute .
&quot; mitchell ,
i can &apos;t tell you how hard ...
how hard this ... &quot;
no , that &apos;s-- no , it &apos;s not personal enough .
okay , okay .
&quot; i can &apos;t tell you how hurt and angry this makes me ,
but you &apos;ve been late too many times .
i &apos;ll need your keys . &quot;
daddy , no ! i &apos;m so sorry !
honey , i didn &apos;t hear you come downstairs .
you couldn &apos;t sleep , either ?
uh , yeah .
no , there &apos;s just , like , a lot on my mind with graduation ,
and what to wear . how does this look ?
wait a second . you &apos;re carrying your shoes .
how am i supposed to judge the whole outfit ?
put &apos; em on .
第三季 第二十三集
so make sure you give this menu here
a good , thorough reading .
soup .
you didn &apos;t even look at it .
soup .
check out what &apos;s below the soup--
sandwiches .
have you check out what is below this outfit ?
this doesn &apos;t come from sandwiches .
look !
&quot; the jay pritchett &quot; ?
i don &apos;t understand .
they named you after a sandwich ?
no ! they named a sandwich after me !
&quot; turkey , bacon , swiss cheese ,
red peppers , anchovies on wheat &quot; ?
most people would stop after the salty bacon ,
but i double down with the anchovies .
were you making a sandwich or attracting deer ?
is this bum bothering you , miss ?
oh , i should get a picture of this--
an actual waitress sighting in this dump .
i took a chance and put in an order for your sandwich ,
although most people like their jay pritchetts to go .
what &apos;s happening ?
gloria , it &apos;s maxine .
so you &apos;re married to jay .
where &apos;d you tie up your seeing eye dog ?
no , no , i &apos;m not , um ...
okay , i get it . i get it .
here &apos;s that number for that neck doctor i want you to see .
thanks .
what &apos;s wrong with your neck ?
for 30 years , i &apos;ve been hearing it &apos;s a handball injury .
but it always seems to get worse with stress .
maybe it &apos;s that audit he &apos;s got coming up .
audit ?
it &apos;s nothing .
oh , isn &apos;t that cute ? he doesn &apos;t want you to worry .
here &apos;s your sandwich .
now you should worry .
look at it-- my prettiest child .
why didn &apos;t you tell me about your neck ?
it &apos;s fine . take a bite .
your company &apos;s getting audited ?
nothing !
three bad days , then it &apos;s over .
come on ! i &apos;m--i &apos;m anxious to hear what you think .
i see it growing on ya .
it &apos;s like maxine when she first tried it .
you know , she--
i don &apos;t like it .
you probably didn &apos;t get all--
jay , i try it . i don &apos;t like it .
that &apos;s all you can say ?
it tastes bad in my mouth .
it &apos;s like a fish and a turkey
beat themselves to death with a pepper .
okay , fair enough . maybe a little picky , though ,
from someone who prepared a colombian specialty
and said , &quot; why are you not eating the hooves ?
they &apos;re the best part . &quot;
i &apos;m back !
oh , hey , uncle cam .
oh , thanks again for picking me up last night .
you &apos;re welcome , but you have to be more careful .
i was the responsible one .
lisa was drinking , and i took her keys ,
and then e--
i understand .
my senior year , i had a pretty crazy night myself
involving a bottle of corn mash and an overturned plow .
seriously ?
yeah . you don &apos;t know terror until you &apos;ve had to
stare down the eyes of a missouri state trooper
and talk your way out of a p.u.i.
honey , you don &apos;t drink coffee .
i do when i &apos;ve been up half the night
worrying about a project that &apos;s only one @-@ third done ,
and i still have an apron to sew , scenery to paint ,
plus my normal crushing workload . so ...
unless you have a better way for me to stimula--
oh , god .
god , coffee &apos;s bitter .
that was your first sip ?
okay , i got the chafing dish ,
salt and pepper shakers-- perfect matches , both .
i may have to readjust my grapes .
oh . ow . i &apos;ll just give you a little privacy .
welcome back to the light show . hi .
hi , lily .
hi , daddy .
lily ...
sweetheart , no .
no , no , no , no . we &apos;re-- we &apos;re not gonna do that today .
actually-- actually , claire ,
we &apos;re--we &apos;re trying not to use the word &quot; no &quot; so much .
we just read a book that said
children learn to rebel against that word .
so we redirect her into a new activity instead .
oh . here--well , just watch this .
lily , sweetie , hi . it &apos;s daddy here .
would you like to listen to some music ?
okay . there you go .
see ?
every new generation thinks
they have cracked the code on child rearing .
what &apos;s the latest theory ? never say &quot; no . &quot;
i say &quot; no &quot; every day in this house .
but at night , she &apos;s a &quot; yes &quot; machine .
no .
oh , it doesn &apos;t seem that she is redirecting her own energy
as much as using a lot of ours .
but do you see how she &apos;s slowly transitioning
from the lights to the music ?
yeah . yeah , i do .
it &apos;s hard to believe there was ever a time
when we just said , &quot; stop doing that . &quot;
oh . the garbage disposal .
lily , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no .
now let &apos;s redirect you into a nap , huh ?
actually , we &apos;re doing this new thing
where we let her tell us when she wants to take a nap .
it &apos;s called &quot; being your own nap captain . &quot;
come on , sweetie .
phil .
did you ring the doorbell ?
oh , no , &apos; cause i have these two coffees .
one is for you .
thank you .
here &apos;s my life-- a full @-@ time job ,
a 3 @-@ year @-@ old , and a second one on the way .
and as a favor ,
i agreed to do a little work for phil &apos;s agency .
the problem is , i &apos;m very good ,
and the more i do , the more they want me .
i @-@ i even turned in a few assignments late
so that they &apos;d fall out of love with me a little bit .
right .
how--how long have you been standing here ?
are--are you-- are you all right ?
oh , yeah .
&apos;cause you &apos;re-- you &apos;re really blinking .
i &apos;m a stress blinker ,
and what really gets me going is confrontation .
i hate it . i @-@ i avoid it at all costs .
terrible at it .
once , i , uh , i tried to break up with a girl ,
and i danced around it so much ,
she didn &apos;t know i had broken up with her .
20 years later , we &apos;re still married .
i am ... really ... sorry ...
about the cold coffee .
it &apos;s not that cold . it &apos;s lukewarm , so ...
okay , so--
funny story about that expression--
when the kids were younger , um , we had a , uh ,
a wading pool ...
and occasionally , luke would have an accident ,
and , um , alex would scream ,
and we &apos;d say , um , &quot; it &apos;s okay , honey ,
he &apos;s just making it lukewarm . &quot;
wow , so--
so i gotta get going ,
but i @-@ i &apos;ll see--
okay , wait !
i &apos;m just gonna come straight out and say it .
mitchell , you &apos;ve done a wonderful job for the agency
since you decided you &apos;d help us out for just a little bit .
and we couldn &apos;t ask for more , could we ?
i wish it didn &apos;t have to end .
in fact , if it was up to me , you &apos;d stay on forever ...
phil , phil ...
but it is not just up to me , is it ?
so ...
i ... phil , i saw this coming ,
and--and look ...
i bailed . i made an excuse and left .
but i @-@ i @-@ i &apos;ve gotta be straight with him .
&quot; phil , i cannot stay on with your firm forever . &quot;
oh ! god , it &apos;s gonna crush him .
maybe i can get claire to do it .
well , that was easy !
we &apos;re really proud of you , buddy .
see you at the ceremony .
you &apos;re not a hero .
i put out a fire .
a fire you started .
was there a fire ?
yes .
did i put it out ?
that &apos;s not--
answer the question .
yes .
i &apos;m getting an award for it .
if they gave awards for starting fires ,
i &apos;d be getting one of those , too .
i know you have a conscience , luke .
do you see this flag ? it stands for justice .
so when that fire marshall gets here ,
i know you &apos;re going to look at that flag
and do the right thing .
you were very quiet all the way home .
are you upset at me because i honked at that old lady ?
normally , we leave the honking to the driver ,
but i &apos;m used to it .
is it because of the sandwich ?
ah , you maybe could have eaten half of it ...
said a couple of nice things .
it &apos;s just a sandwich , jay .
it &apos;s not about the delicious sandwich , gloria .
it &apos;s about being respectful of a person &apos;s feelings .
but i was just being honest .
you don &apos;t have to be honest
about every little thing in a relationship .
some things you say , some things you don &apos;t .
what are the things that you don &apos;t say ?
gloria , i really don &apos;t wanna do this anymore .
oh , really ?
but you cannot just try to teach me a lesson ,
and then not even ..
okay , fine .
i don &apos;t say this ,
but it ... bothers me a little bit
that you &apos;re just a tiny bit ... loud .
loud ?
not all the time .
only when you , you know , when you talk .
so i embarrass you ?
gloria ...
what ?
am i being too loud again ?
all right . buckle up .
oh , i &apos;m gonna go and try to do the laundry ,
and i &apos;m gonna do it very quietly
so i don &apos;t bother you . maybe manny can help me .
manny !
i get it .
manny !
i get it .
now you &apos;re not even making any noise .
okay , this is way too many grapes ,
and this spoon is modern day ,
so if we use it , everyone at the table has to react in shock
at the spoon from the future .
okay . and that went down the drain .
and you need a nap .
you need a nap .
i got it . ooh , i lost it . shoot .
let me know if i can eliminate any distractions for you .
oh , i got it . no , i got a finger on it . there it is .
oh , lost it again .
maybe you should just wait until it comes to you .
you know , make it the captain of its own spoon platoon .
i understand the point you &apos;re making , claire , but ...
oh ! now i &apos;m stuck .
yeah , cam , you are stuck .
you are stuck on a philosophy that clearly doesn &apos;t work .
sometimes , you need to say &quot; no &quot; to a child .
yeah , and sometimes you need to say &quot; no &quot; to an adult .
no , claire . no , i don &apos;t need help raising my child .
oh . okay .
sorry .
guess i @-@ i do have a lot to learn .
right now , i @-@ i &apos;m looking forward to learning
if you will get your arm out of there
before lily gets to the garbage disposal switch .
um ... lily , sweetie !
c @-@ can you do something , please , claire ?
i would like to . really , i would ,
but i would probably just say &quot; no &quot;
and shred her confidence and mangle her self @-@ esteem .
okay , fine ! i &apos;m sorry ! just--here ,
stop her ! stop her ! sweetie !
what to do with you ?
claire ! okay !
ohh ! yes !
you think that &apos;s funny , don &apos;t ya ?
oh , sure .
yes . well , it &apos;s wicked , claire . it &apos;s wicked .
come on . we &apos;re leaving , lily !
lily !
it &apos;s living art .
we stay perfectly still for 90 seconds ,
basically doing nothing .
sounds like my first wife .
i don &apos;t know . she always moved for me .
as long as you both agree it was only 90 seconds .
two nerds with one stone !
i love working in an office .
is that your brother @-@ in @-@ law ? i thought you fired him .
i did , before work .
then what &apos;s he doing here ?
is he disgruntled ? he looks disgruntled .
no , he always looks like that .
hey . how &apos;s it going ?
hey , hey . listen--
okay , i know this is uncomfortable ...
but we really need to talk about my future here .
but i @-@ i @-@ i thought we--
no , i know . i know i led you to believe
that i &apos;d be able to stay on here indefinitely ,
and--and ... o @-@ okay ,
don &apos;t get all blinky . oh .
no , it &apos;s not all bad news , okay ?
okay .
you will have me until july , like we agreed .
okay , great .
yes .
hey , could you jump on the elevator with me real quick ?
yes .
yes . i could use a hand carrying up some stuff from my car .
oh ! my goodness . i probably need some empty boxes , don &apos;t i ?
you know what ? you head down ,
i &apos;ll meet you at the glass doors .
there was something else . what was it ?
i know it &apos;s in there . oh , yeah , you &apos;re fired .
what ? f @-@ fired ? !
w @-@ what &apos;s going on with these things ?
you trying to open &apos; em ?
i guess i better ... get somebody .
wait , wait , wait , wait , wait , wait--
you &apos;re firing me ?
i @-@ i don &apos;t even like this job .
that can &apos;t be safe .
is someone trapped in there ?
the guy they fired .
oh , the lazy guy ?
lazy ? !
you handed in a couple of things late .
i should have warned you .
i &apos;m terrible at breaking bad news .
well , then why did you come over to my house
and tell me how great i was ?
that was me trying to fire you !
i haven &apos;t felt like this since i tried to
break up with claire 20 years ago .
someone &apos;s stuck again ?
that lawyer with the attitude they just fired .
they said it was your attitude ,
like you were doing us a favor .
i was doing you a favor !
why didn &apos;t he get the service like everyone else ?
lazy
don &apos;t worry . he can &apos;t get you .
two hours i was stuck in there
with the entire office of people staring at me ,
i @-@ i finally had to lie down .
doesn &apos;t help my reputation
figures .
you guys nailed it .
dude , that was surreal .
dad , come on !
we have a minute to set up !
where are mitchell and cam ?
hey , manny . thanks for what you said before about the flag .
it really got me thinking .
i knew you had a conscience , luke .
and more importantly , you &apos;ve got a good ...
you didn &apos;t .
yep . and thanks to you ,
i had them move the ceremony to right under the flag .
i &apos;ll sign a picture for you .
oh , there you are . i was afraid you weren &apos;t coming .
it was a discussion .
if we weren &apos;t gonna show up ,
we would have clearly let you know ,
and not humiliated you in public .
if it &apos;s any consolation ,
the lawyer we hired to replace you
is already suing the elevator company .
you &apos;re sitting on my hand .
be thankful you have two .
i almost lost one today .
oh , stop being such a baby .
she was nowhere near that switch .
shh ! keep your voices down.we &apos;re about to go on .
why you looking at me ?
am i too loud ? is that what everybody thinks ?
what ?
there &apos;s a backstory here
you don &apos;t wanna know about .
i want turkey .
save your appetite , baby girl .
and don &apos;t forget , afterwards ,
we &apos;re going to lenny &apos;s for a bite to eat--
more than a bite if you value my feelings .
oh ! great , we get to see maxine .
what ? you know maxine , too ?
oh , we all know maxine .
love .
second @-@ best hugger in the world ,
after mr. burt reynolds . story to follow .
all right , guys , this will all be over in 90 seconds .
hold your poses .
okay .
i really wanna impress mr. gorgeous .
jarvis ! shut up .
hey , mitch , i know this isn &apos;t a good time ,
i @-@ i just want you to know ,
i &apos;m really--
i know , phil.you &apos;re really sorry , okay ?
but this is gonna take me a little time to get over , all right ?
actually , i was gonna say i &apos;m really gonna need your parking pass .
what ? !
our next stage presentation will be alex dunphy &apos;s interpretation
of norman rockwell &apos;s 1943 painting ,
&quot; freedom from want &quot;
how do you sleep at night , luke ?
with a medal around my neck .
i want turkey .
lily , no !
she doesn &apos;t understand that word .
cram it , claire .
control your child , cam .
it &apos;s not that difficult . i &apos;ve raised three .
really ?
cam !
why don &apos;t you ask haley what time she got home last night ?
uncle cam !
sorry , dear . collateral damage .
what is he talking about ?
your arms are shaking .
oh , yeah ,
i &apos;m sure that the great maxine can do a better job !
you can criticize my parenting all you like , cam ,
but my son just won a medal .
for a fire he started .
luke , is that true ?
how long ? it &apos;s getting heavy !
you &apos;re not getting that parking pass back .
i tried to let you down easy .
you don &apos;t know how to talk to people , phil .
it &apos;s just like when claire didn &apos;t even know you dumped her .
what ?
when did dad dump you ?
i didn &apos;t dump her ! i just tried to !
i am losing it !
just a few more seconds !
i want turkey .
lily , no !
we really are trying to not say that word .
b @-@ minus ,
but there was a silver lining .
&quot; i expected more , alex . &quot;
alex !
i am gonna call haley and tell her
we &apos;re not going to that deli .
i can &apos;t take another minute of cam .
you know , i &apos;m not even sure
i believe all these new parenting theories ,
but i &apos;ll be damned if i &apos;m gonna let her tell me they &apos;re wrong .
we are not going to dinner .
i tried that sandwich .
it &apos;s not that good . you &apos;re not missing anything .
i sure won &apos;t miss seeing luke and that stupid medal .
i play by the rules . where &apos;s my medal ?
jay can stay with that maxine .
she &apos;s not loud like me .
in fairness , you can be a little quick to give advice .
well , i &apos;m always ready to help ,
if that &apos;s what you mean , yeah .
yeah , but if you &apos;re not careful , it can come off a little ...
know @-@ it @-@ all @-@ y .
that &apos;s not a word .
what you mean to say is ,
it can come off like i know it all .
i &apos;ve always been this way .
that &apos;s why i wanted to break up with you .
the word &quot; fired &quot; doesn &apos;t even apply .
you can &apos;t get fired from a favor .
okay , sweetie , maybe you should just let it go .
like i always say , it &apos;s better to carry a tune than a grudge .
okay , you ... you &apos;ve never said that , but ...
and--and what about this grudge you &apos;re holding against claire ?
i don &apos;t see you trading that in for a tune .
that is completely different .
she insulted my parenting skills .
which , you have to admit , you can be pretty defensive about .
okay , so maybe we both can be a little sensitive .
n @-@ no . no .
no . these--these are-- these are not equal .
no , you have no idea what it feels like to be fired .
yes , i do . i &apos;ve been fired . everyone has .
not me .
never ?
no .
nope , i &apos;ve always been very good at what i do .
so then maybe what you &apos;re feeling
is a little insecure about your work for the first time .
that &apos;s hogwash .
as someone who &apos;s seen actual hogwash ,
i can assure you that it &apos;s not .
i don &apos;t know why you &apos;re so bothered by maxine .
she &apos;s nice .
oh , good ! why don &apos;t you , jay , and maxine
live together , eating sandwiches forever ? !
can i float a theory here , mom ?
you sound like you &apos;re jealous .
please !
me jealous of that woman ?
i just don &apos;t like the way they talk to each other !
and the little jokes ,
and she knows everything about his life !
just makes me feel like , em ...
is that jealous ?
ay , my poor sisters .
just you ? i thought the whole family was swinging by .
who knows what they &apos;re doing ?
right now , they &apos;re all sniping at each other .
ah , who needs &apos; em ?
right . as long as i have you , maxine ...
i &apos;m off in five .
hey , luke !
what &apos;s with all the hardware ?
well , he set fire to a school and lied about it .
you know they give medals for anything these days .
it &apos;s going back tomorrow .
he doesn &apos;t get a lot of medals .
i just really need one of these .
don &apos;t hold back . oh !
my girls . there they are . hi .
hello , hello . hi , all .
hey , cam . hey !
come on in !
i , uh , i appreciate your coming .
and , again , i really , really--thank you .
there she is .
well , look who made it .
hola , maxine . so nice to see you .
let me get you some menus .
we don &apos;t need it .
it &apos;s jay pritchetts all around !
gloria , if you want your sandwich without anchovies ,
i won &apos;t be offended .
of course , then it &apos;ll be a jack feldman .
hey , man .
is the repair guy here ?
he &apos;s working on it .
um , listen , uh ,
it &apos;s katie &apos;s birthday , skip &apos;s assistant .
big 3 @-@ 0 . still no ring .
you woke me up to tell me that ?
no , no . i @-@ i grabbed you some cake .
oh , sure it &apos;s not for employees only ?
okay . had that coming .
who are you talking to , phil ?
mitchell .
who ?
mitchell , my br-- uh , the lazy guy .
i was doing you a favor .
all right , just give me the cake . i &apos;m hungry .
