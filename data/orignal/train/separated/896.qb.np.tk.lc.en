back in the &apos; 80s , they combined
the two greatest things in the world --
music and television .
we all remember our favorite veejays introducing
the coolest videos on a constant loop .
the budgets were as high as the hair ,
and the animation ranged from dancing cats
to hunky cartoon boyfriends .
and no one was more addicted to it than me and my sister .
i can &apos;t decide whether that guy &apos;s hotter
as a human or a cartoon .
if jessica rabbit taught us anything -- cartoon .
i mean , what did we even do before mtv existed ?
i think we just listened to music like animals .
get out !
you &apos;ve been watching this music mtv television for six hours .
enough is enough . go do your homework .
well , if you think about it , i &apos;m gonna be a musician ,
so this is my homework .
and if you really think about it ,
my life &apos;s passion is making films ,
so this is my homework , too .
well , my passion is snuggies ,
which i &apos;m gonna shower you with if you don &apos;t leave right now .
go before i kiss your belly .
and you -- have you even looked at the college catalogs i brought you ?
actually , i have ,
and i &apos;ve narrowed it down to my top choices .
oh , yes ! it &apos;s happening !
you &apos;re growing up .
oh , no . it &apos;s happening . i &apos;m not ready for this .
make time stop . make it stop !
focus !
okay , one option is the london conservatory of music .
ocean between us -- pass .
there &apos;s also an awesome music program at ucla .
country between us -- pass .
boston school of music .
a connecticut between us -- pass .
mom .
what about something here in town ,
like the prestigious jenkintown funk academy ?
that &apos;s the dance studio / karate dojo
next to the mattress store .
there &apos;s got to be something within driving distance .
well , i guess juilliard is in new york .
that &apos;s my dream school , but no one gets in .
we &apos;re going to juilliard .
okay , stop .
that &apos;s the best school in the country .
best for you , closest for me .
i am gonna make this happen .
i &apos;m not getting in .
we &apos;re going to juilliard .
it &apos;s impossible .
we &apos;re going to juilliard !
it was may 6 , 1980 @-@ something .
the school day was going off without a hitch
all thanks to the watchful eye of principal earl ball .
let &apos;s go , youngsters .
activate those legs so we can activate those minds .
ooh , yes .
that &apos;s definitely going into &quot; earl &apos;s pearls . &quot;
hello there , sir .
um , there was a spill in science lab .
and we needed a mop .
we were kissing . she &apos;s pretty .
why did you call me when it &apos;s usually my wife
who handles this annoying school crap ?
well , truthfully , i couldn &apos;t reach her .
and more truthfully ,
i didn &apos;t try because she scares me .
sorry i &apos;m late .
we &apos;re having a sale down at the --
son of a bitch .
oh , this guy .
and that guy was lainey &apos;s dad ,
my father &apos;s archenemy , bill lewis .
look , i called you both in here today
because we need to talk about what &apos;s going on with your kids .
there &apos;s nothing going on ,
because i very clearly and emphatically forbade it .
well , for the third time this week ,
i caught them canoodling in secret .
it &apos;s unacceptable .
we have a saying in texas -- &quot; don &apos;t blame the armadillo .
blame the armadillo &apos;s dumb father . &quot;
we have a saying here --
you &apos;re bald .
i &apos;ll have you know , the ladies love it .
okay .
what is happening here right now ?
i &apos;ll tell you what &apos;s happening .
this schmuck lives in philadelphia ,
yet he roots for the dallas cowboys .
who does that ?
red @-@ blooded americans , that &apos;s who does that .
got to say , it surprises me ,
this friction that exists between the two of you ,
considering how similar you are .
please .
come on .
no , no , no .
for example , you &apos;re both fathers .
you &apos;re both small @-@ business owners .
you both seem very angry .
that is true .
i &apos;ll give you that .
and you &apos;re both football fans .
now , this is a bond which i can respect
as a lifelong fan of the new york football giants .
whoa , you &apos;re a giants fan ?
why the hell do you live in philadelphia ?
he &apos;s got a point .
unlike the giants last season .
for your information , we won the conference last year ,
so suck it !
so what i actually mean to say is that it &apos;s always easier
to get along than be short with each other .
and that is one of &quot; earl &apos;s pearls &quot;
you can take to the bank .
well , thank you for your wise advice
and , uh , the giants suck .
yeah . they suck so hard .
but good luck next season .
whoops .
that day , my dad and bill lewis discovered
their mutual hatred of the giants
wasn &apos;t the only thing they had in common .
what are you doing here ?
everyone knows it &apos;s the best bar
across the street from the school .
do you know how i discovered this place ?
last year &apos;s christmas concert -- i bailed at intermission .
you lasted a lot longer than i did .
40 kids playing &quot; jingle bells &quot; on the clarinet ?
i mean , how does that ever end well ?
i &apos;ll tell you how it ends --
with five of these , bill .
you got that right , murray .
hey , &quot; bill murray , &quot; like the ghostbuster .
that &apos;s funny . i love bill murray .
oh , he &apos;s the best .
remember , uh , &quot; caddyshack &quot; ?
yeah .
&quot; cinderella story .
used to be a greenskeeper ,
about to be masters champion .
got about an eight iron , i think .
it &apos;s in the hole . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s in the hole . i &apos;m in &apos; stripes . &apos; &quot;
wow . that is terrible .
yeah . impressions aren &apos;t my thing .
&quot; well , at least you got that going for you . &quot;
as my dad started to break the ice with his archnemesis ,
my mom was heating up her quest
to make erica &apos;s dream of juilliard come true .
mrs. goldberg , i understand that the college admissions process
can be a very scary journey .
the best thing i can say is i &apos;m scared , too .
honestly , it is hard out there .
wow . that &apos;s your opening ?
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;ve been up for the past 26 hours .
i have a sick parrot at home .
well , the good news is , we &apos;ve narrowed down
our top choice to juilliard .
i know it &apos;s long shot ,
but do you think i have a chance of getting in ?
absolutely .
erica , you can do anything that you set your mind to .
it &apos;s like my posters say --
&quot; keep reaching for the stars , &quot; &quot; hang in there , &quot;
and that &apos;s the band rush .
that &apos;s because i &apos;m the cool guidance counselor
who shows up at the school basketball games
in a casual polo .
see , erica ? this can happen .
this is so cool .
well , i &apos;m gonna go work on my audition . thanks , mom .
oh , that &apos;s the spirit .
you can do anything you want -- anything at --
ah , yeah , she ain &apos;t gonna get in .
excuse me ?
look , erica is very talented ,
but juilliard is another level , okay ?
they only take the best of the best .
and that &apos;s my daughter .
okay , let me break it down for you .
imagine all of the best people in a room .
they only pick the best of those best people .
my daughter .
okay .
maybe i &apos;m not making myself clear .
we start with the best .
my daughter .
not just at this school , but of all the people --
the whole world .
they only pick the best of those best people .
so , when can we take a tour ?
you know , maybe a visual aid
might help you understand this a little bit better .
this is patty snitzenberg .
she wrote this piece .
she carved the cello .
she &apos;s also blind .
and they rejected her
like the cold sons of bitches that they are .
well , erica is getting into juilliard .
you want to know why ?
&apos;cause i will make it happen .
you don &apos;t know the things i &apos;ve done for my children .
you don &apos;t want to know .
i kind of want to know .
you cannot know .
look , this has to happen .
i convinced her to apply . i gave her hope .
yeah , i used to have a &quot; hope &quot; poster up there , too .
then i realized it was giving the kids
too much unrealistic hope .
but with my mom in charge , we didn &apos;t need hope .
meanwhile , my dad was charged up on his new friendship .
look at you handsome fellas .
the hell &apos;s the matter with you ?
yeah .
you seem happy when you should be super angry with me .
nah . you &apos;re a cute kid .
what ?
okay , what &apos;s going on here ?
nothing . i just had lunch with bill lewis .
you know , once you get past the shiny head -- not so awful .
oh , my god . you &apos;re friends now ? !
let &apos;s not get crazy .
this is amazing !
if mr. lewis likes you , then he &apos;ll like me .
i &apos;m proud of you , mur .
never thought i &apos;d see the day where you made a friend .
what are you talking about ? i got friends .
name one .
vic .
he &apos;s your employee . you pay him to be around you .
what about deli guy ? love deli guy .
you only love him &apos; cause he gives you corned beef .
do you even know what he looks like ?
yeah , deli guy .
you know , uh ... wears an apron .
goes like this .
face it , dad .
this is your first real friend .
so , when are you hanging out next ?
okay , he &apos;s just a guy i had lunch with .
it &apos;s no big deal .
hello ?
hold on .
it &apos;s him .
play it cool .
tell him you &apos;re on the other line with another friend .
get out of here .
hey , bill .
yeah . nothing .
just , uh , watching the tube .
are you kidding ? i love cheese steaks .
barry !
get off the phone . i can hear you breathing .
ask him how he &apos;s feeling ,
then compliment his telephone voice .
barry !
as my dad made plans with his new best friend ,
my mom had her own plan
to make erica look like the best of the best .
hi , juilliard admissions board .
i &apos;m erica goldberg from jenkintown , pennsylvania .
and i &apos;m going to play --
cut .
cut . that &apos;s a cut .
no , not &quot; cut . &quot;
i &apos;m in the middle of my juilliard audition .
hon , i love the spirit and the passion
and everything you &apos;re doing here ,
but it &apos;s , like , &quot; gag me with a spoon . &quot;
sorry , do you kids still say that ?
we never really did .
you need a video that stands out ,
like the ones on your mtv music television .
ooh , i like where you &apos;re heading here .
we &apos;re talking crazy camera angles ,
pyrotechnics , jiggly girls .
everyone loves jiggly girls .
we &apos;ll put a pin in that one .
guys , juilliard is a serious place .
i just need to showcase my voice .
you said it yourself --
mtv is the way people want to experience music these days .
sure , you can sing .
but we also want show them that
you &apos;re a star like madonna .
but you really are a virgin . say you &apos;re a virgin .
actually , no , don &apos;t tell me .
i guess a cool audition tape would kind of make me stand out .
you focus on your music and leave the rest to us .
yeah .
by the time we &apos;re done ,
juilliard will be begging you to go .
just trust mama .
nothing crazy .
you got it , schmoopie .
we got to figure out how to get a white stallion down here .
it was saturday afternoon , and my dad was about to take
his friendship with bill lewis to the next level .
i &apos;m going out .
whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa . wait .
going where ? dmv ? car wash ?
picking up trash on the highway ?
i &apos;m meeting bill lewis .
exactly .
this is the first time you &apos;re hanging out
with your new , special friend .
you &apos;re looking like a monday morning
when i need you to look like a friday night .
i usually sit in front of the tv with no pants on friday night .
seems like that &apos;s most nights .
look , lainey and i need this friendship to work .
that means putting in some actual effort .
but not too much effort .
you don &apos;t want to seem like you &apos;re trying too hard .
here , let me fix this .
stop it , you moron .
i &apos;m having cheesesteaks with another middle @-@ aged man .
he doesn &apos;t care what i look like .
of course not .
although my dad does have
some surprisingly strong opinions about loafers .
he &apos;s not a fan .
would you consider changing to a lace @-@ up ?
no ! where &apos;d you get my shoes ?
do you even have an icebreaker ?
anecdote , topic of conversation , funny joke ?
you guys are nuts .
get out of my head !
and so began the first
and only bromance of murray goldberg &apos;s life .
for the next two weeks ,
their adventures would become the stuff of legend .
bill and murray were a dynamic duo
that shared so much in common ...
like tv ... and sitting .
and food and more food
and bathroom breaks ...
and napping ...
... and sitting and sweating ...
could you turn the air @-@ conditioning on ?
right over there .
... and tv ...
... and more tv .
you think i could pull off a magnum mustache ?
you throw away your razor and buy a hawaiian shirt ,
because you are magnum .
a sony watchman .
bill , you shouldn &apos;t have .
well , i saw it , and a tv reminded me of you .
1.1 / 2 @-@ inch screen , glorious black @-@ and @-@ white ,
and you can take this thing anywhere and no one will even notice .
this is perfect for my on @-@ the @-@ go lifestyle .
yup , my dad was discovering the highs of true friendship .
unfortunately , he was about to discover the lows .
well , it &apos;s late . i guess i should go .
you sure you don &apos;t want to watch me watch ?
nah , i can &apos;t .
to be honest , i should probably be by myself .
tough night for me and all .
okay .
&apos;cause seven years ago today my wife left me
to raise lainey on my own .
o @-@ okay .
kind of rocked my world .
o @-@ okay .
i guess talking it out would be helpful .
or taking a nice walk alone .
and with that , bill lewis opened up his heart
to my closed @-@ off dad .
i wish i had some batteries .
meanwhile , i was downstairs kicking off my career
as a visionary music @-@ video director .
whoa . what &apos;s with the stool , honey ?
don &apos;t call me &quot; honey . &quot; it &apos;s weird .
and what &apos;s all this crap ?
okay , i watched seven straight hours of mtv ,
and i cracked their formula .
a music video is one part thumping bass ,
one part big hair , and one part animated dancing cat .
go away .
trust your director .
ditch the stool and sit on this taxidermy ram .
and my mom said i was creepy for owning this .
um , why is dave kim here ?
we needed a crew , and he said he would work for free
if he could stand close to you .
classic love story -- pop star falls for roadie .
that &apos;s never happened in the history of music .
oh , it will . in fact , it &apos;s already begun .
action .
* you with the sad eyes *
* don &apos;t be discouraged *
as director , it was my job
to amp up my sister &apos;s tender love ballad .
first , the wind machine ...
gah ! why ? !
... next , a rock &apos; n &apos; roll reptile ...
... followed by a thick , haunting fog .
can anyone hear me ?
and since all my mom cared about
was getting erica into juilliard ,
she paid for a blue screen .
stop it . mom , what are you doing ?
it &apos;s a dancing cat like in the paula abdul video .
my mom even hired a band of sexy ,
stone @-@ faced , robert palmer dancers
from the jenkintown funk academy .
yep , i drew from every badass music video before me ,
from a @-@ ha to zz top ,
and it was genius .
meanwhile , my dad was looking for a clever way
to bail on his friend .
hey , guys .
help me .
i should go .
no , i should . uh ...
okay , let &apos;s go out the back door .
come on .
thanks for this , mur .
it &apos;s nice to have a friendly ear to count on .
see you soon ?
yeah , we &apos;ll be in touch .
drive safe , pal .
and that concludes my brief foray into friendship .
wait , what ? no !
he cried on my shirt -- on my shirt !
deli guy never cries on my shirt .
deli guy isn &apos;t your friend !
i &apos;m sorry , but bill &apos;s got to go .
don &apos;t you dare hurt him .
he &apos;s a wonderful person and the gatekeeper
to the only hot girl i ever tricked into liking me .
it &apos;s over , barry . move on .
okay , i don &apos;t want to get real right now ,
but if you blow this friendship , i &apos;m gonna be extremely angry .
you &apos;re always angry .
damn it ! it &apos;s so true and even more angering !
for the next week , my dad avoided bill lewis
as my mom desperately waited
for me to finish my masterpiece .
i &apos;m trying to work here .
the deadline for juilliard is this week .
just show us what you &apos;ve got .
* so don &apos;t be afraid to let them show *
* your true colors *
stop it ! stop it . stop .
this part &apos;s definitely not right .
i said , knowing what was to come .
my intention was for erica to be beckoned
into a magical cartoon world like in the a @-@ ha video ,
but it ended up looking like this .
* ... inside you can make you feel so small *
* and i see your true colors *
oh , no , no , no , no , no , no .
my god !
here &apos;s the thing --
i may have bitten off more than i could chew .
it turns out animation is really hard
and it requires hundreds of people .
this is terrible ! i can &apos;t send this in .
look , we all agree this video isn &apos;t it .
not it ?
are you seeing what i &apos;m seeing ?
there &apos;s robots punching dragons ,
and i &apos;m a droopy @-@ eyed stick figure riding a unicorn !
gag me with a spoon !
see , i knew you still used that phrase .
you know , i could probably cover a lot of this with smoke .
a lot of smoke .
just forget it . i &apos;m not an idiot .
i know i &apos;m not the best ,
and i probably have no chance of getting into juilliard .
and at that moment , my mom knew erica was right .
i &apos;m sorry , mom , but it &apos;s over .
turns out , my mom &apos;s dream of keeping erica close to home
was only pushing them apart .
ever since bill &apos;s emotional outburst ,
my dad had been avoiding him .
only problem -- he couldn &apos;t hide forever .
oof . hide me .
huh ?
hey , mur .
there you are , standing behind that other guy .
it &apos;s me , bill lewis .
oh , hey , bill .
what are you doing here , where i work ?
hadn &apos;t heard from you in a week .
thought i &apos;d drop on by , see if you &apos;re okay .
yeah , well , uh , we &apos;ve just been crazy @-@ busy here at work .
anyway , hey , you want to hit tgi fridays ?
it &apos;s like every day is friday at that place .
actually , i got lunch plans with vic .
who &apos;s vic ?
i &apos;m vic .
you and vic buddies ?
i never heard you mention him before .
yeah , we don &apos;t hang out much . he &apos;s just an employee .
was i just an employee
when we went clamming together that one time ?
you went clamming with this man , and you didn &apos;t invite me ?
i didn &apos;t even know you then .
it was nothing .
oh , is that right ?
what &apos;s the problem here , mur @-@ man ?
you know what the real problem is ?
you and your man tears .
murray &apos;s got walls .
how about you , vic ?
you want to hit up tgi fridays with me ?
no , man . i don &apos;t know you .
well , this is a fine how @-@ do @-@ you @-@ do .
i &apos;ll see you never .
walls , murray . you got walls .
as my dad watched his only friend walk out of his life ,
my mom was finally ready to set erica off on her own path .
hey , schmoopie @-@ boops .
stop it . i told you no more music mtv videos .
agreed .
this is the way you should have done it all along --
your way .
w @-@ what &apos;s the point ?
the point is to try .
look , don &apos;t give up
just because i pushed you in the wrong direction .
my mom finally accepted that she couldn &apos;t control
where her little girl would get into college .
take this guitar and do what you do best .
but as long as erica stayed true to herself ,
she &apos;d always find her way back home .
* you with the sad eyes *
* don &apos;t be discouraged *
* oh , i realize *
* it &apos;s hard to take courage *
* in a world full of people *
* you can lose sight of it all *
miss him , don &apos;t you ?
no .
then why are you watching the teeny tv he gave you
when there &apos;s a big one right there ?
maybe it was kind of nice to have somebody to hang out with ...
... even though he cried .
murray , that &apos;s what friendship is .
you got to be there in the good times and in the bad .
i guess i &apos;m just not cut out for that kind of thing .
no , you are .
&apos;cause of all the friends i ever made in my life ...
... you &apos;re my favorite .
turns out , bill wasn &apos;t my father &apos;s first friend .
it was pops .
and it made my dad realize that opening yourself up
isn &apos;t as hard as he thought .
oh , it &apos;s you .
should i leave ?
&apos;cause you never know when i might express my feelings --
you know , like a human being .
if you &apos;re sad ,
you can talk to me about your ex @-@ wife and all .
i &apos;m actually feeling better today .
thank god .
hey , bill murray .
it &apos;s funny how life works out .
you find that your worst enemy can become your greatest ally .
and the greatest guidance counselors
aren &apos;t the ones you &apos;re given in school .
they &apos;re the people who love you most .
well , here goes nothing .
no matter what happens ...
you &apos;ll always be the best of the best to me .
&apos;cause in the end , when you &apos;ve got family to help guide you
and good friends to lean on ...
nothing in life is impossible .
&quot; and the flowers are still standing . &quot;
&quot; i &apos;m bill murray . &apos; meatballs &apos; and &apos; scrooged . &apos; &quot;
you know , that &apos;s not really an impression .
funny movies , though .
they &apos;re very funny . funny movies .
比尔 · 路易斯
i know you still got a couple of years here , but we like to check in early
to see where you &apos;re thinking of going to college .
where did you go to school ?
princeton .
okay . let &apos;s cross that off the list .
princeton happens to be a very prestigious university .
but you &apos;re here .
so ...
hey , i have a lot of side projects .
like what ?
i sculpt .
i &apos;m working on a heart smart cook book .
and i have my bird .
yeah , maybe there &apos;s someone else i can talk to .
that &apos;d probably be best .
hang in there , andre , hang in there !
