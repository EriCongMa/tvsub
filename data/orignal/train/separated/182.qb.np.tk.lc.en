gossip girl here ...
your one and only source
into the scandalous lives of manhattan &apos;s elite .
you never heard of olivia burke ?
you know , that &quot; endless knights &quot; series
has made , like , a billion dollars .
i have been dreaming of coming to nyu
and just being a normal student .
this night is finally over ,
and as far as i &apos;m concerned , so are we .
where &apos;s your better half ?
i don &apos;t know . i was looking for her .
well , i can leave .
it &apos;s okay. stay .
i &apos;m not sick .
then what are you doing home so early ?
did something happen ?
ask jenny .
i &apos;m still your friend . i &apos;m still your sister .
i just can &apos;t let the worlds get confused .
i want nothing to do with you in either world .
have you been so busy that you &apos;ve forgotten
what time of year it is ? let me give you a hint--
couture , quadrilles and cutthroat competition .
that &apos;s right .
it &apos;s time for cotillion .
this guy &apos;s a foot shorter than me .
here &apos;s one that &apos;s 6 &apos; 2 . &quot;
yeah , and he goes to york .
that &apos;s practically public school .
have i not impressed on you three
how important tomorrow night is ?
it &apos;s my debut in society . i have to be perfect ,
and that means having the perfect escort .
i told you who i wanted .
we tried .
well , try harder .
graham collins is the hottest guy on the upper east side .
there &apos;s like this bubble of perfection around him
that we can &apos;t penetrate .
well , you better figure out a way .
otherwise , tomorrow night i &apos;m taking one of your escorts .
just like the mob , new york prep schools
have their own five families .
you may be the john gotti of constance , little j. ,
but that doesn &apos;t mean
you &apos;ll ever be part of this cosa nostra .
oh , my god. everyone &apos;s here .
come on. let &apos;s go say hi . ..
i have a surprise for you .
in that case , why are you still dressed ?
that was yesterday .
today we &apos;re seeing the kandinsky exhibit
and having dinner at e.a.t.
well , i &apos;d love to , but i think you &apos;ve forgotten
today &apos;s nate &apos;s move @-@ in day .
we &apos;re celebrating with a lost weekend .
i never signed off on a lost weekend .
do you really think i wanna spend my weekend
watching women with tramp stamps work out their daddy issues
it &apos;s for nate . anyway , you &apos;ll be busy with cotillion .
aren &apos;t you supposed to be a mentor ?
and risk running into serena ? no , thank you .
though it does kill me to imagine
those poor girls stumbling along without my guidance .
isn &apos;t it about time you and serena made up ?
you love cotillion. you should be doing it together .
don &apos;t the festivities begin tonight ?
there &apos;s a dinner at the van der woodsens&apos;
for debs and mentors .
but knowing serena , she &apos;ll probably flake .
or she &apos;ll be waiting for you , apology in hand , and really ,
a debutante ball without blair waldorf
is like a tour de france without lance armstrong .
i resent the comparison to that man @-@ whore .
though your other point is well taken .
i suppose the charitable thing
would be give serena the opportunity
to beg for forgiveness .
don &apos;t get too lost , bass .
a lot of my responsibilities from k.c. &apos; s office
would translate to this job
event planning , writing press releases .
okay .
&quot; okay &quot; as in i have the job &quot; okay &quot; ?
what ?
just like that ?
you make a good case .
also , i remember our summer relay races
at nate &apos;s hamptons house .
underneath that smile is a heart of a killer .
me ?
need i remind you of the potato sack race incident of &apos; 98 ?
i still have evidence of your unsportsmanlike behavior .
although given our new circumstances ,
i maybe have to forgive you now .
um ... i should , uh , i should probably go .
i , uh , i &apos;m a mentor at cotillion this year ,
and my mom asked me to host a dinner at our house .
of course. well , we &apos;re here all day every day .
but i &apos;ll see you monday .
great .
thank you so much for asking me to come in and interview .
our talk on election night really meant a lot to me .
me , too .
i didn &apos;t realize we were hiring .
could always use another person , right ?
do you think you can get brain damage
from learning too much too fast ?
no .
you &apos;re the one who wanted the real college experience ,
cramming for exams .
i know .
oh , my god . no way !
please tell me that guinevere will use the unholy grail
to free lancelot from arthur &apos;s eternal torture .
endless knight 4 ? why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
because it &apos;s not happening .
those rumors have been going around forever .
but warner bros. sent out a press release .
i &apos;ll never trust harry knowles again .
sorry , guys .
weird .
it &apos;s not happening .
if it were true , i &apos;d have about a hundred phone calls
about it by now .
crap .
i &apos;ll be right back .
i &apos;m sure it &apos;s not true .
though it &apos;d be kinda awesome .
all right , debs , enough socializing .
uh , we have a lot to get through .
so if you &apos;ll please find your escorts
and take your places ...
um , lily ,
um , as you know , i don &apos;t have my escort situation
fully ironed out yet , so ...
oh , that &apos;s okay. um , maximillian here
will , um , dance with you today .
he is divine . i think it &apos;ll be great
to have some one @-@ on @-@ one tutoring because i know
you have some catching up to do .
ca @-@ catching up ? i , uh , this was the first rehearsal .
i know , but , um , the other girls
have been taking ballroom for years ,
so you will be great .
you have your father &apos;s natural rhythm .
um , i &apos;m just gonna get a drink of water .
okay .
hey , jenny . hey , jenny .
hi. uh , you &apos;re kira , right ?
i &apos;m eric van der woodsen .
our mothers arranged for me to be your escort .
oh , right. so humiliating i couldn &apos;t get my own date ,
but thank you .
well , it &apos;ll be fun .
you &apos;re jenny humphrey &apos;s brother , aren &apos;t you
that &apos;s my claim to fame
those girls who hang out with her are so lucky .
who &apos;s her escort ? well , she &apos;s obsessed with getting graham collins
graham lives in my building . we &apos;ve been neighbors forever .
i could ...
not breathe a word .
i know graham , too . i went to camp suisse with him .
i could probably introduce them myself .
so why don &apos;t you ?
because , uh , jenny hates it when other people get involved
in her personal life . i would definitely stay out if it if i were you .
really ?
absolutely. so you ready to dance ?
sure. just let me get my shoes
all right . okay , ladies , find your escort .
i want to make her remember why she came to college .
the ... the part that doesn &apos;t involve the library
or waking up with a textbook stuck to your face .
i think if we can do that , then we got a fighting chance
at keeping her here .
you mean like &quot; the 15 things every college student
must do before graduating &quot;
uh , yeah , exactly that. uh ...
yeah. no , we haven &apos;t cheered ourselves hoarse
at a sporting event. we haven &apos;t gotten sick
after a beer pong tournament at bar none .
we haven &apos;t had sex with someone we don &apos;t want to see again .
well , no , actually , i ... i did that one with georgina .
true .
you know , but we haven &apos;t done any of this--
falafel at mamoun &apos;s , frat party crawl .
it &apos;s for real this time
my parents , my manager and three of my agents
are all flying out from l.a. on monday
to convince me to do it .
it &apos;s like &quot; the sopranos , &quot;
but with bagels .
hadn &apos;t they all agreed to give you this year for college ?
well but it doesn &apos;t really matter . i &apos;m pretty sure they &apos;re
on the phone with the dean right now ,
getting him to let me finish classes from location .
i mean , how do i fight that ? by telling them that college is
about a lot more than just classes .
you don &apos;t have beer pong on location .
what ?
we &apos;ll explain on the way .
but your college life begins now .
you don &apos;t know the dances .
no , i do . i ...
i ... you &apos;d think that it would be enough
to just be the queen of constance , but , no
then you have to be the queen of the entire upper east side
which means having the perfect escort and ...
i &apos;m just gonna make a complete fool out of myself , aren &apos;t i ?
probably .
you know , i ... i really thought
that if ii made the perfect debut
people would finally forget that i &apos;m just a brooklyn nobody .
it helps if you count out loud .
eric , you don &apos;t have to be nice to me .
i &apos;ve been so awful to you and jonathan .
it &apos;s true . but i &apos;m a better person than you are .
that &apos;s also true .
come here .
there &apos;s only one official dance .
you can learn that easy .
stop complaining . start counting . ready ?
one , two , three , four , out . one , two , three , back in .
you know , i wish that you could just be my escort .
at least then ii &apos;d have fun .
ii &apos;m gonna turn you .
okay .
um ...
well ...
what about jonathan ?
he &apos;s not graham collins , but he is a whitney .
debuting with gertrude whitney &apos;s great @-@ grandson
will count for a lot with the deb ball crowd .
walk .
well , do you think he &apos;d even go with me ?
well , he will once i talk to him .
well , then i &apos;ll have my minions call off the search .
thank you .
in the complicated world of debutante balls
one must choose her dance partner wisely .
you never know when a hand on the hip
can lead to a knife in the back .
blair .
serena . anything you want to say to me ?
welcome .
i see . that &apos;s it ?
uh , well , there &apos;s a list of debs and their mentors
on the coffee table .
you can find out who llily assigned you to .
my deb &apos;s right here , right , jenny ?
uh , yeah , serena &apos;s my mentor. why ?
oh , of course , if that &apos;s what you want . it &apos;s just a shame .
you know how i feel about your potential .
blair , are we really doing this right now ?
i gave you a chance to apologize
how about you apologize ?
i &apos;m here , aren &apos;t i ?
ahem . okay , look , i have enough of my own problems
so i &apos;m not gonna let you guys make me a pawn in your war .
war ? what ? of course not .
who &apos;s your escort ?
jonathan whitney .
your stepbrother &apos;s boyfriend .
do you remember who my escort was ?
nate .
jenny , when you descend those stairs tomorrow night
everyone there will judge you , based on that moment
for the rest of your life .
this is not like your wedding day .
cotillion only happens once . now you already have one strike
against you because of the whole brooklyn misfortune
and add a &quot; b + &quot; escort and top it off with
a mentor who &apos;s known more for her mug shots
and topless photos in ibiza than her
social graces ?
okay , you know what ? jenny ,
you shouldn &apos;t be caught between blair and me .
it &apos;s not fair to you on your big night .
she can be your mentor . it &apos;s fine .
how selfless .
actually , i &apos;m working for congressman tripp van der bilt
and i should get back to that . but you have fun tonight .
these are probably the last people in new york
who still think you matter .
no . i &apos;m sorry . i don &apos;t want to .
jenny feels bad about what happened .
great . she should feel bad
that doesn &apos;t mean i have to be her escort to cotillion .
she &apos;s at the tipping point
she &apos;s not darth vader yet .
she could still stay anakin .
we have to stop her before we truly lose her to the dark side .
fine . but she &apos;d better really want to do this .
she does . i promise .
hey . i didn &apos;t think you were coming in till monday .
well , my night suddenly opened up
and i know you said you work late
so i thought you might be hungry .
thanks . i &apos;m starving .
but are you sure ? i mean , it &apos;s friday night .
i &apos;ll take real politics over the
ones at cotillion any night
joe wilson has nothing on blair waldorf .
okay .
so what--what is all this ?
uh , 1 speech , 15 drafts .
is there anything your new media
relations rep can do to help ?
well , the speech is about school lunches ,
teacher salaries and term limits .
that &apos;s all ? here . let me see .
oh , watch out for your tie . there you go .
congressman ? i &apos;ll come back .
actually ... you know , i have to finish this .
you--you don &apos;t want to run anything by me ?
why don &apos;t you go home ?
tomorrow you can meet brian . you &apos;ll report to him .
okay .
thanks for the food .
yeah .
hi . i &apos;m kira . i go to constance with you .
yeah , sure , i &apos;ve seen you around .
you have ?
that &apos;s awesome .
blair waldorf &apos;s your mentor ?
who needs graham collins when you have her ?
what do you know about graham ?
when eric told me you wanted to go with him ,
i called and asked him , and he was totally up for it .
he told me he texted you , but you said you already had an escort .
what ? when ?
today . right after you left rehearsal .
oh , my god .
did you text graham collins that i didn &apos;t want him
to be my escort ?
i knew that if you had the chance to go with graham
you &apos;d make the wrong choice .
that wasn &apos;t your decision to make
i don &apos;t believe this .
jonathan .
mentee and mentee &apos;s stepbroth / escort &apos;s boyfriend ,
can you please stop embarrassing me ? people are staring .
eric tried to sabotage me .
i was trying to save you .
i don &apos;t know why everybody loves graham so much .
i went to camp with the guy , and he &apos;s a ...
he &apos;s a creep . what ?
you knew him this whole time
i had a plan from the beginning ,
and i should have stuck to it
i &apos;m going to cotillion with graham collins .
i &apos;ll allow it . sorry , eric .
actually , blair , since i &apos;m queen of constance
and graham collins wants to be my escort ,
i don &apos;t think i need you as my mentor anymore .
jenny , you &apos;re lucky to have me . don &apos;t push it .
your era &apos;s over .
and so is that headband .
so should i call graham ?
now that i know he wants to go with me ,
i think i &apos;ll call him myself .
uh @-@ oh , little j .
you &apos;ve stepped on eric &apos;s toes one too many times . whoa .
she can &apos;t get away with this .
she won &apos;t .
now he &apos;s found a new partner .
who knows what could happen
when these two start to tango ?
morning . oh . i see the moving in went well .
hey , blair .
blair .
excuse the mess . how was dinner ?
did you and serena work things out ?
oh no . she took off immediately , thank god
then i had to relieve her of her mentor duties .
is that pole artist wearing my agent provocateur corset ?
just make sure she &apos;s careful undoing the eyehooks .
they pinch . i just came to grab a dress for tonight .
the last time i saw blair that freakishly calm ...
was when serena left for boarding school .
and you know as well as i do , the calm won &apos;t last .
and when it breaks ,
there are going to be pieces of blair all over the wall .
and i really don &apos;t want to clean up that mess .
what are she and serena fighting about this time ?
basically how each one loves the other
more than the other loves her .
can you even fight about that ?
you might want to ring housekeeping .
chocolate leaves a stain .
toodles .
hey . i didn &apos;t realize you were here .
yeah , i &apos;m just about to take off . i was leaving you a note
to check out this new press release .
i &apos;m sure it &apos;s fine .
just show it to bour summer make it back .
okay .
did i do something wrong ?
no , i just-- i don &apos;t have time to chat .
um , i &apos;m at work , serena .
but you &apos;re-- you &apos;re just acting like
you don &apos;t really want me here or something .
that &apos;s not it .
well , what then ?
this was a huge mistake .
what was ? hiring me ? tripp , i &apos;m sorry ,
but you &apos;re--you &apos;re the one who asked me
to come in for the interview . if you didn &apos;t want me
working here , then why would you do that ?
i did want you here .
i find you smart and charming
and i wanted to help you out . but having you here ?
i didn &apos;t realize how much it would affect me .
say something .
sorry . um ...
you know what ? don &apos;t worry about me .
it &apos;s not gonna be a problem . i have to go .
serena , wait . please .
it &apos;s--it &apos;s fine .
excuse me .
i don &apos;t understand .
how can you make me queen ?
simple . to become queen , you must take down the queen .
but i want to be jenny &apos;s friend .
kira , let me tell you a story
i used to have a friend like jenny .
she was beautiful , fabulous ,
and she let me make all these sacrifices for her .
and you know what i got back in that investment ? zero .
because girls like her run emotional ponzi schemes .
serena will never like you the way you like her .
you mean jenny .
details . now are you ready to be queen ,
or do i need to find a new frog ?
we hear jenny humphrey
has landed graham collins as her escort .
better put on that lip gloss , ladies .
look like you &apos;ll be kissing jenny humphrey &apos;s ring
by the end of the night .
good @-@ bye , jenny from brooklyn .
on three . one , two three ! whoo !
oh , god .
this is even more amazing than dancing in the fountain .
i &apos;ll be right back .
um , don &apos;t do any mind @-@ altering substances without me .
okay . all right .
you know , i think this is gonna work .
really ?
it &apos;s gonna-- yeah , she &apos;s gonna--what ?
i knew you were trouble humphrey
you &apos;re trying to get olivia to abandon
her calling as queen of the undead .
you don &apos;t
think morgana could take over camelot
vanessa , don &apos;t ...
sorry . but lancelot
wouldn &apos;t let that happen would he ?
if the realm falls into the wrong hands ,
it &apos;s on your head .
he means you can kiss your credit rating good @-@ bye .
nice v @-@ neck
thank you for coming .
that &apos;s-- those are your people .
shut up .
who &apos;s ready for a keg stand ?
i have to take the movie .
even i have to admit--
this may just be my makeover swan song .
and not to take anything away from your moment ,
but i &apos;m still not sure anyone &apos;s going to think
i &apos;m better than jenny .
they will when they see who your escort is .
but i &apos;m going with eric . i mean , he &apos;s nice and all , but ...
eric &apos;s not your escort anymore .
then who is ?
you know graham collins , right ?
graham ?
spin your partner &apos; round and &apos; round .
looks like little j is going down .
you know , you don &apos;t have to do this if you don &apos;t want to .
oh , well , it &apos;s a little late for that .
that . you look beautiful jenny
i &apos;m just saying , i &apos;ll always love you ,
with or without society &apos;s approval .
thanks , dad ,
but honestly i can &apos;t wait to walk down those steps .
so i &apos;ll see you soon .
hey , jenny . have you seen blair ?
um , no , not yet fortunately
i &apos;m looking for my escort , graham collins .
he &apos;s , uh , sort of this year &apos;s , i guess , you .
i &apos;ll take that as a compliment . hey , have fun tonight .
thanks . i plan to .
always lead with the right .
and no claw hands . relaxed fingers .
oh , look .
a lost boy from lost weekend .
chuck actually sent me to find you .
he has a surprise in the private lounge upstairs .
he says &quot; please . &quot;
go . we &apos;ve got it under control .
okay .
but i &apos;m just curious . you never told me--
how exactly did you get graham to ditch jenny for kira ?
i told graham that what happens at camp suisse .
doesn &apos;t stay at camp suisse .
little van der woodsen ,
i &apos;m impressed with your natural talents .
and we were good long distance ,
you know , with your sushi pun text flirting and all that .
i know . it &apos;s much easier to be pithy on ichat .
i &apos;m gonna be back next year .
there &apos;s too many people depending on me for this one .
i grew up on these sets . this crew is like my family .
i never thought i &apos;d be sad to
hear about &quot; endless nightfall &quot;
when do you have to go ?
well , fight choreography starts right away ,
so , you know , with the midterms over ,
it makes sense for me to leave for london next week .
so much for the ultimate college experience .
what ? no .
i have had the ultimate experience , with you guys .
they say that the friends you meet here last a lifetime .
do you guys want to get out of here ?
absolutely .
yeah . let &apos;s do it .
what are you doing here ?
waiting for you .
you sent me a text to meet you ,
and then you keep me waiting for half an hour ?
i didn &apos;t text you . i lost my phone .
nate told me to come meet ... chuck .
right .
going down .
not without me .
can you press the button , please ?
i &apos;ve pressed the button .
if you don &apos;t believe me , you can press it yourself .
great .
hello ? i &apos;m trapped in the elevator
with someone who sucks all the air out of the room .
send help or i &apos;ll be dead within the hour .
not until you two work things out .
bass ?
th @-@ this is a punishable offense ,
and not the kind of punishment you like !
i &apos;m only doing what you refused to do yourself .
chuck , this is not funny .
there &apos;s a single malt
and some laduring macaroons in the storage box ,
plenty to sustain you until you two figure things out .
so ...
what did my text supposedly say ?
that you were sorry and you missed me .
did you text me back ?
miss jane cordelia trapp ,
escorted by mr . theodore davis iii .
miss sawyer harriett bennett ,
escorted by mr . evan jameson jr .
miss jennifer tallulah humphrey ,
escorted by mr . graham collins .
my apologies .
miss kira abernathy ,
escorted by mr . graham collins .
who &apos;s your escort , dear ?
what just happened ?
jenny humphrey went to a ball .
i don &apos;t--i don &apos;t know .
jenny humphrey had a great fall .
and none of her minions , mentors or friends
want to put jenny together again .
what is wrong with her ?
jenny , my darling , what happened ? are you all right ?
do you want to pick someone else to walk with ?
it doesn &apos;t work that way , dad . you only get one chance .
have you seen blair ?
uh , no . sorry . i know she &apos;s behind this .
and it &apos;s all because i didn &apos;t want her as my mentor .
what if it &apos;s all for the best ?
i mean , don &apos;t you think that maybe being queen
isn &apos;t worth it ?
you really don &apos;t understand .
i was going to walk down those steps
and finally stop having to prove myself .
let it go , jenny.i &apos;s over
that &apos;s what blair thinks .
hi . are you still here ?
you went looking for your father ?
yeah , and i @-@ i found him , too ,
but he didn &apos;t want to see me .
what ?
why didn &apos;t you say anything while all of this was happening ?
i guess i was ashamed .
your dad adores you ,
all your dads do .
and rufus would do anything for dan and jenny .
even nate--he may have to go to prison to see his dad ,
but the captain would never turn him away .
i &apos;m even jealous of nate &apos;s dad .
not knowing you
is your father &apos;s loss .
maybe , but i ...
i just can &apos;t seem to let it go .
i keep leaving him messages
and writing letters to addresses i &apos;m not even sure are his .
you miss him .
you &apos;re allowed .
i don &apos;t want to .
all i even remember of him is him going on trips
and then coming back and bringing me presents .
and then one day he didn &apos;t come back .
and now it &apos;s like
i @-@ i can &apos;t seem to get anything right anymore .
between carter and the paparazzi
and brown and ...
and now tripp .
tripp van der bilt ?
yeah , it--i guess i &apos;ve--i &apos;ve kind of had a crush on him .
but it was nothing . i mean , he &apos;s--he &apos;s married ,
and he &apos;s always treated me like a kid .
but now we work together , and tonight--
did something happen ?
no . no , nothing . your text saved me .
but now i don &apos;t know if i can trust myself around him .
then you can &apos;t see him again .
carter was one thing , but tripp is a married congressman .
i know .
serena ...
i know .
promise me you won &apos;t see him or speak to him again
without coming to me first .
okay . i promise .
thank you , blair .
if you two want to kiss ,
it won &apos;t count as cheating .
creepy , chuck .
okay , wait . so you guys used a prefab college experience
to get me to stay ?
oh , yeah .
shamelessly plucked from the headlines .
wait , how many did we eventually get through ?
i think we got , uh , what-- let &apos;s see . there &apos;s the ...
beer boggle and fountain yoga
you know , i think we got a solid 14 out of 15 .
so you can go back to london with your head held high .
what ?
i am not going with just one more to go .
now come on . let &apos;s--let &apos;s do the last one .
let &apos;s just do it right now .
mm . it can &apos;t be worse
than the bathroom at fat black pussycat &apos;s .
i wouldn &apos;t say worse
that one .
have you ever , uh ...
have i ? no . no .
no , never .
wait ... no , never . have you ?
once .
but it was in a movie ,
so that doesn &apos;t really count .
not me . no .
let &apos;s find nate and chuck and congratulate them .
and then torture them .
may i have your attention , please ?
due to extenuating circumstances ,
we have one last debutante to present--
miss jennifer tallulah humphrey .
she &apos;s walking alone ?
nobody walks alone .
escorted by mr. nathaniel archibald .
a college guy ?
nate archibald is ... epic .
well , we found nate .
oh , e. , you tried to play dirty at the dance .
but you should know
nobody puts jenny in the corner ,
and now she &apos;s having the time of her life .
so thanks for saving me again .
you know how these girls are .
i &apos;m glad it worked out .
nate ?
i gotta say , i didn &apos;t see that one coming .
well , i learned from the best .
good answer .
the other queens would like to pay their respects .
you look beautiful , jenny . enjoy your night .
thank you .
so ... now what ? you wanna get something to eat ?
yeah , but first i need to stop by tripp &apos;s office ...
to hand in my resignation . it &apos;s
just up the street
that &apos;s my girl .
thanks for comin .
you won &apos;t believe who jenny got to walk with her .
i read all about it on &quot; gossip girl . &quot;
but i didn &apos;t come here because of jenny .
were you serious on your message ?
have you really been scheming with blair ?
uh , yeah , i @-@ i know it sounds crazy , but--
so it &apos;s official-- you &apos;ve sunk to jenny &apos;s level .
i was doing it to help her .
although it didn &apos;t exactly turn out
as i planned .
really ? i am shocked
the point is , it doesn &apos;t matter . she &apos;s not worth our time .
she &apos;s not the only one .
i don &apos;t want to do this anymore .
well , we won &apos;t . like i said , i &apos;m--i &apos;m done with jenny .
i &apos;m not talking about jenny .
jonathan , come on .
i promise i &apos;ll never talk to her again .
it &apos;s not about jenny . it &apos;s about who you &apos;ve become .
i liked you because you were different from everyone else .
you were smart and you knew who you were .
you didn &apos;t need to prove anything to anyone .
and now ?
i &apos;m ...
i &apos;m sorry , eric , but it &apos;s over .
you were the one who said
to restrict our scheming to outsiders .
desperate times , desperate measures .
and i &apos;m willing to accept my punishment .
in fact , i left a few props up in the lounge .
sadly , your punishment is going to be an evening without me .
i &apos;m gonna spend it with my best friend .
oh , and if you ever loan out my lingerie again ...
well ...
i just hope you like me in flannel .
eric .
i thought maybe you bailed .
did you see it ? it was awesome .
i really showed blair . she even admitted it herself .
yeah , you really showed her .
hey , look , i &apos;m sorry about jonathan becoming collateral damage .
but you understand , right ? i had no choice .
and you did lie to me .
oh , a bunch of us are going to serafina . you wanna come ?
go celebrate with your friends .
okay .
you know , you really put yourself on the radar tonight .
better not make that mistake again , or you &apos;ll pay for real .
she can threaten me all she wants .
i &apos;m not going back to social oblivion .
don &apos;t worry .
next time we take jenny down , it &apos;ll be for good .
some people think that when the party ends ,
the night is over .
but i &apos;ve found
it &apos;s when the music stops and the lights come up
that the real trouble begins .
hi .
i &apos;m glad you came . i want to apologize .
i shouldn &apos;t have said anything .
no , i &apos;m--i &apos;m glad you did .
but i don &apos;t think it &apos;s a good idea
for me to work for you anymore .
i actually came here to say that i quit .
i completely understand why you &apos;d want to quit
after what i said today .
but don &apos;t throw this away , serena .
you deserve this opportunity .
and i want you there .
for whatever reason , i trust you ,
and i don &apos;t have many people i can say that about
in my work or my life .
yeah , i , uh ...
i feel the same way .
and i promise to never cross that line .
we &apos;re both adults .
we &apos;ll just agree to keep things friendly and professional .
okay .
friendly and professional .
plus , i still owe you for the injury .
yeah .
serena !
i mean , serena , there you are .
may i speak to you alone for a moment , please ?
hey , tripp .
blair , it &apos;s okay .
i &apos;ll call you tomorrow . i &apos;m ... i &apos;m fine .
i can see that .
i &apos;m sorry . she &apos;s a little ...
did you even ...
i still really don &apos;t get
how these events work .
one chance , two chances .
jonathan , graham , nate .
even i can &apos;t explain that one .
but i don &apos;t think i &apos;ve seen jenny this happy ... ahh .
since she was 8 and made her first dress .
thanks , lil .
i know the committee didn &apos;t make it easy for you
to let in a humphrey from brooklyn .
well , what kind of parents would we be
if we didn &apos;t do what we could do to make our children happy ?
mmm . coming to bed ?
mm , yeah , in a minute .
uh , vanya said there &apos;s something
to sign for to pass the street
okay . yeah . mm .
you better get your beauty rest now ,
because it looks like things could get ugly in the morning .
