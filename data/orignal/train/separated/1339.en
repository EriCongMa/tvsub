You went without me.
You wouldn't get up.
Because it was nighttime.
It was 4:30.
Yeah. In Boston, we call that "Nighttime."
Good morning.
How far did you go?
I went to the, uh, B.U. Bridge.
You went 12 miles? Are you supposed to do that?
Sure. Why not? Me and my braces have made peace.
Can you leave those on?
They're so hot.
Don't. I-I'm sweaty.
I love you.
Well, I say it to you in my head.
I guess it was time to say it out loud.
That sounds so bizarre when we say it.
So which one of us is gonna say "Uncle"?
Yeah, there doesn't seem to be a way around it, does there?
One of us has to be a house-spouse.
Why is it so complicated?
Don't stress. They've extended my leave.
We have two more weeks to think about it.
Really?!
Morning!
Everybody decent in there?!
Yes! Perfect timing!
We were hoping to have an orgy,
and then we realized we were one person short.
Ha. Hey, Maura.
Hi. Uh, you still want to run to Boston Joe's?
Go. I know you hate my army coffee.
I'm sorry.
Get out of here.
I'll see you later.
Wait! Bye.
Okay, bye.
Come on! Get him! Get him!
Yes!
Oh, shoot!
Hey, wait!
Oh, no.
Hey, there. Did you miss your bus?
Hey, my name's Brent.
I work at the three-ring car wash.
I know. Silly outfit, right?
Well, uh, come on.
I'm going right past, uh, Lower Mills elementary school.
Is that where you're headed?
Yeah.
I-I-I can drop you.
T-that's -- that's okay. - Oh, come on. Here.
Wait. Hey, that's mine!
Hey, hey. What the hell are you doing?
No! Don't! Let go of him!
Let go of him!
Back off!
Why don't you mind your own business?!
No, I want to know what the hell you think you're doing.
Get off of me!
I'm calling the police.
What do I do?
Indecisiveness is associated with a range
of problematic psychological outcomes,
including anxiety and depression.
Well, if he has to leave the army
or I have to quit my job, I can assure you both of us
are going to be very anxious and depressed.
Okay. Why can't we be like them?
Look, they're so sweet and simple.
Oh, morning.
Are you helping Neda?
or just flirting?
Flirting. You're gonna get me in trouble.
Two low-fat flat lattes coming up.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thanks for being so nice to her.
She worries every time she sees you.
Why? Because she called me a "Bitch" the first time she met me?
I've already forgotten it.
You know what? In fairness to Neda,
she did think that you threw your hot coffee on a stranger.
See?
Your mom is so great, Jane.
How do you know my mom?
Don't tell me she's cheating on her espresso machine
and buying her coffee here.
No, I met her at the division one caf?
Angela is letting Neda use it
as a model for her master's thesis.
Oh? What's your thesis?
It's a business plan to turn Angela's drinks and healthy homemade food
into a chain.
Maybe ma will make it rich after all.
Well, it's all theoretical.
No, it isn't.
You've been helping her integrate
more vegan recipes into her menu.
What? No. Don't do that.
Coffee party's over.
Frost, will you give us a ride
back to my place so we can change?
Sure thing.
Thanks, Neda.
Thank you.
See you later.
Okay, this is a weird one.
Well, let's start with introductions. Who's that?
Abraham Reynolds. Lived right over there.
He died being a good samaritan.
What happened?
10-year-old boy named Zack says a man
tried to grab him and force him into a car.
Reynolds saw it, jumped in to try to rescue the kid.
He appears to have suffered a subdural hematoma.
Did the boy describe the kidnapper?
He said it was a clown.
What is it?
In 1988, a 10-year-old boy was abducted by a clown
on his way home from school.
Nick Hamilton.
I'll never forget it. I was 12.
Ma wouldn't let us go anywhere for months.
We called it the "Summer of the clown."
I was still in uniform. It was a bad time.
Well, what happened to Nick?
Never found him -- or the clown.
A random clown kidnapped a kid?
No. No. No.
There were three attempted kidnappings on young boys
before the clown grabbed Nick.
I never liked clowns.
Coulrophobia -- fear of clowns.
A recent study has confirmed
that clowns are disliked by most children.
What do we know about this clown?
Said his name was "Brent"
and he was headed for his job at a clown car wash.
As far as I know, there are no clown car washes in Boston.
Frost, can you do a search?
Yeah, sure.
Oh, he's holding something.
Satin polyester trim.
Yellow. Shiny.
Looks like something a clown would wear.
No clown motifs on any businesses near here,
including car washes.
Found something.
Yeah. Looks like a petal, maybe?
Yeah, it's a piece of a plastic flower.
We might have a footprint here.
Yep. Clown shoe. Big one.
All right, let's have CSRU get here
and make a cast impression.
I'm not liking this.
Me, either.
Tell me our poor, dead Samaritan managed to scratch the clown.
I'm not sure I have any skin cells yet,
but there's a beige, powdery substance
under his index finger.
We need the killer's skin, Maura.
He had a pre-existing condition.
Wait, no! Don't stop!
We could get lucky and get the killer's DNA.
Hold your horses.
Homer said that to Antilochus
to get him to stop driving his chariot like a maniac.
Aha. I had always wondered.
See this? It's an aneurysm.
What, it burst when his skull struck the curb?
Yes.
Anything on the plastic flower?
Uh, we did a headspace analysis.
I'd like a headspace analysis.
It would help me figure out
if I'm going to marry the love of my life,
or stay here and solve murders and become an old cat lady.
You'll never be a cat lady.
You'll be a dog lady.
Are you having lunch with Casey?
Wh-- only if you talk faster about the plastic flower.
It has volatile organic chemical levels
close to 1,000 parts per million.
Even faster.
The FDA hasn't allowed levels over 500 since 1990.
Wait, since 1990...
That means...
The flower was probably manufactured in the '80s.
Don't cancel your lunch.
I-I-I'm not. I'm ordering files from the archives.
If the costume our killer was wearing is from the '80s,
Maybe there's a connection to that '88 kidnapping.
Jane asked me to bring up all the incident reports.
Put them over there.
Okay, but you're gonna need a bigger squad room.
There are hundreds of boxes down there.
Do you really want to go through all the incident reports
from June, July, and August of '88?
No. We really want you to go through them all.
Look for any reports that mention a clown.
Why would the clown be back?
If you find it boring going through old files,
maybe Martinez has something exciting to do.
Yeah, somebody's got to count all those seized Xanax pills.
Hey, Frankie, did you ever notice how Frost
can talk and work at the same time?
"Bats in the attic."
"Lost car keys."
"My neighbor flashed his butt at me."
These aren't sorted.
That's why you're here.
Did you find the three files on the attempted kidnappings?
Yeah. They're right there.
I also found the missing-persons files.
Ah, I remember that kid.
尼克·汉密尔顿
His face was everywhere, even on milk cartons.
Yeah, the only witness to Nick's kidnapping
was a housewife who saw it from her kitchen window.
"A housewife"?
Are you gonna tell me the ladies
like to be called "Domestic engineers"?
"The ladies"?
Oh, stop busting my balls.
We got to set up a separate tip line.
I'll set one up in BRIC.
Yeah, brace yourself. We had
thousands of false clown sightings in '88 --
teenagers playing pranks, parents flipping out.
Didn't help us find this boy.
Oh, the forensic artist just finished with Zack.
He was the only witness to the clown.
Release it, although I doubt the bad guy
is still wandering around in his clown getup.
This is beautiful.
I never have a real lunch.
Last time I was on a picnic,
I was with my family at Franklin Park Zoo.
And my father insisted on fixing the water fountain
and snapped the pipe.
I hope it was the marine section.
No, it was the elephant section.
What did the elephants do?
They shot water at us.
I know you, uh -- you hate to be away
when you're in the middle of a case, so...
It makes me mad that some poor guy
trying to save a kid got murdered.
Let's not talk work.
It's okay. I want to support you.
I support what you do.
I want to do the same for you.
Casey, I don't want to be responsible
for ruining your career.
You know, they want you to be a general.
Do you know how few people get that opportunity?
I feel the same way about asking you to be an army wife.
Your work's important, and you're so good at it.
So, what do we do?
So, maybe it's time I resigned my commission.
If anyone was born to be a leader, you are.
I googled you, you know.
So you know about the sex change?
Shut up.
No. I know that you have a Purple Heart.
I know that you have a Distinguished Service Cross.
And I know how you got those medals.
Here. Put this on your finger.
I want to see what size you wear.
Okay.
All right.
Well... let's hope you're a 7.
How did you know?
I pay attention.
I always thought I'd know what to say
when the man I loved proposed to me.
But I'm making you wait. It's not fair.
Sure, it is. We haven't figured it out yet.
Just...
Just don't say anything. Just wear it.
See how it feels.
I think my customers are gonna be able to tell
the meatballs aren't meat.
You can taste the chickpeas.
Maybe you can give them an upbeat name,
Like "Ciao, italia meatballs."
You think that'll fool Jane?
Uh, no.
Is everything all right?
No.
You ever get what you've wanted,
and you're not sure you want it anymore?
Uh, yes, positive-psychology research suggests
we should not only be careful what we wish for
but why we wish for it.
I just got offered the job of a lifetime.
Well, that's wonderful!
In beijing.
Oh. That's...far.
What does detective Frost say?
I haven't told him yet.
What do you want to do?
Take the job...
and stay in Boston with Barry.
Those are mutually exclusive.
I just wish I could have it all.
No one has it all.
Do you... regret your choices?
I mean, you're a, you know, respected professional.
You made it.
Fulfilling your dreams requires a lot of hard choices.
You know, pain over a breakup will fade,
But you need to ask whether putting him before yourself
is something that you will regret.
Did you find anyone who wears a size-25 clown shoe?
Uh, no, but I did find skin cells
under the victim's fingernails.
Looks like enough to give us a DNA profile of his attacker.
What about the beige, powdery stuff?
Uh, we ran it through the gas spectrometer.
It's paint.
Paint? What, like clown face paint?
Uh, no, like flexible latex paint.
It's a mixture of rubber cement, pigment, and naphtha.
What's naphtha?
Highly volatile mixture of hydrocarbons.
You gonna mention that diamond you're wearing,
or do I ignore it?
You don't watch many romantic comedies, do you?
I do not.
Well, I'm supposed to get all giggly and girly
and you're supposed to squeal.
Why would I squeal over
a colorless, crystalline form of pure carbon?
You have to admit it's pretty.
I just wanted to wear it for a couple minutes.
I don't want to think about what it means. I just...
Talk to me about the paint!
It was used on a slush-molded latex mask.
Okay, so, our good samaritan
must have grabbed the killer by his rubber clown mask.
Can you trace the manufacturer?
Lab techs are already working on it.
So...you're leaving?
What? No. No.
I didn't say "Yes."
Can you see yourself as a general's wife?
I mean --
What if I leave behind my life here
and we don't work out as a couple?
Or he leaves his?
One of us has to ruin a career for us to be together.
It's...it's not fair.
Well, if life were fair,
All 7 billion of us would have one shoe
and a piece of cardboard to call "Home."
How are you gonna survive with one shoe?
How will I survive without my best friend?
Maura.
Wait! What are you doing?
I think I have a foreign body on my cornea.
Wait. Maura...
No. No. I'm okay.
Dr. Isles. Why would you do that?
I'm -- I'm sorry, Detective. Do what?
Encourage my girlfriend to move to China.
I wasn't encouraging her.
I was simply being a sounding board.
Really? "The pain over a breakup will fade.
The regret that you put him before yourself won't."
I'm so sorry. I --
But that is out of context. I-I didn't --
She's leaving on Friday, thanks to you.
This isn't too bad.
No. Shouldn't take us more than a couple of years.
What is this pile?
213 clown sightings.
We got hobo clowns, fast-food clowns,
mimes, evil clowns, bozo the clown.
I must have taken a few hundred of those myself.
I can't believe all we have to go on
are 25-year-old incident reports.
What's the matter?
Nothing.
Doesn't look like nothing.
Sergeant Korsak.
Yeah, where?
Okay.
Kid was abducted by a clown fitting our description.
Grab Jane. Let's go.
Did you see what happened?
No, no -- I was making a delivery,
and I pulled over as soon as I saw this backpack
in the middle of the street.
We'll need to take that.
The boy must have dropped it.
Please tell us everything you saw.
I-it happened so fast.
All I saw was the clown driving away with a little boy.
Can you describe the car?
Uh...g-grey, maybe, o-or silver?
A sedan? Compact? Station wagon?
Sedan, I think.
Did you get a good look at the boy?
Not really. He looked so frightened.
I'm looking for my son.
He should be home. His bus stop is right here.
That's my son's.
That's Kevin's!
Okay, okay, um, do you have any pictures of your son?
They're -- they're -- they're in my house.
Okay. W-why don't we go to your house and get them, okay?
Okay. Okay.
I just -- I-I have to call my husband first.
We failed that kid.
No, we didn't.
Yes, we did.
We didn't catch the clown, and now he has her little boy.
Jane.
What?!
I'm on a picnic with my boyfriend
while the killer's out looking for his next victim.
I have something. We've identified
the manufacturer of the mask through the paint formula.
It was made by Every Mask, Inc.,
and they went out of business in 1989.
I'll start making calls,
see if I can track down someone who might have records.
Something just came in on the tip line.
What do you have?
A text with a video link came in on the tip line.
Texted by phone?
Yeah
Did you track the phone?
No go. It was sent from a burn phone.
Bet you didn't think you'd see me again, did you?
Oh, my god.
That's a taunt.
Say hello to Kevin.
Tell me that he's breathing, Maura.
Tell me that child is alive.
I-I can't tell, Jane.
We got to find that boy.
Frost, let's go through every piece of video
that he sent us frame by frame.
Play it from the beginning.
Jane? Sorry.
Can I talk to you?
I-I-I can't right now.
I-it'll have to wait. I'm sorry.
It can't.
Okay, um, jut give me two seconds.
I'll meet you downstairs.
Okay, uh, start with the section
where he moves the camera.
Jane, we can go through this.
We'll call if there's anything.
Go
Hey. I'm so sorry. I know you're busy.
No, no. I'm sorry, too. I just -- I don't have a lot of time.
My leave's been canceled.
What?
I've got emergency orders to return.
I'm catching a plane now.
You have to?
Yeah.
Okay, uh...
Well, I-I-I wish I could take you to the airport,
but we have a missing kid.
Oh, it's okay. I mean it.
No, it's not.
What do -- what do we do?
I don't know. Do you?
Still on hold with city hall.
Do they know it's an emergency?
That's why they haven't hung up.
They're going through about a decade's worth
of business records.
Yeah, yeah. Still here.
Detective Frost, could you continue
playing the video in slow motion?
Uh-huh. Great. Thanks.
A guy named Buzz Wallace owned Every Mask, inc.
Let's hope Buzz is still alive and he kept good records.
Hey, freeze it there.
Is that a window?
I can enhance the image.
Do it. That's a window.
Are those houses across the street?
Yes. There's a weather vane.
Let's see which way the arrow on it's pointing.
I'll check the wind direction for this morning.
North by northeast.
So, the arrow is pointing north-ish.
Which means you're looking for a house
on the east side of a street that runs north to south.
Thank you, Magellan.
Okay.
Good news/bad news.
He did manufacture those masks, but he sold thousands of 'em.
Sergeant, didn't the boy, Zack,
say the clown was headed to a clown car wash?
Perhaps there was a car wash in that time
that had some kind of a sales stunt?
I'll see if Buzz sold any clown masks
to a car wash in the 1980s.
Got something -- a fire-alarm box
on the telephone pole across the street from the basement.
The first number is worn off.
That would identify the district.
There are 1,200 of those all over the city.
Oh! Oh, good thing Buzz is retired.
Guy is always online.
Yep -- he says he shipped a dozen clown masks
to three-ring car wash in 1988.
Searching for a three-ring car wash.
Three-ring car wash. It was owned by William Miller.
It closed in 2007.
Got a home address?
2141 Lincoln Avenue.
Looks like William Miller died six months ago.
The house is in probate.
Miller left the house to his son, Brent.
The clown told Zack his name was Brent.
I'll retire from the army. I'll come back to Boston.
Jane!
And you'll hate it. And you'll hate me.
And... and I have to go.
Me, too.
Bye.
We got a possible address on the house.
We have units on the way.
Okay, well, let's pray that boy's still alive.
No.
No, no, no, no, no. No. Kevin?
Mommy?
No, sweetie. Listen to me, okay?
You're safe. I'm a police officer.
We're gonna take you home, okay?
Okay. Get him out of here.
Contact wound.
Put the gun right to his own head.
Saved us a whole lot of trouble.
Looks like he was doing construction.
Probably planned to sell the family home
once it cleared probate.
There's an area of tattooing and scorched skin
around the perimeter of the wound.
Blowback on the right-hand glove.
It's likely a suicide.
I've got a box of clown costumes here.
Let's get them in for processing.
Brent Miller was in Boston in '88.
He and his father are pretty good suspects
in the disappearance of that boy, Nick Hamilton.
All right, let's get the cadaver dogs
and the ground-penetrating radar here.
Search the property for his body.
There's no telling how many crimes this guy committed.
"It will all be okay."
Yeah, sure it will.
Jane?
I'm terrible company.
So am I. I didn't come by to talk.
Where's your ring?
Huh? Oh, it's -- safe deposit box.
Maura, this is talking.
I'll stop. And Angong won't talk, either.
Oh, good. You brought Angong.
Who is Angong?
Tang koon tee nan.
I thought you could use a Thai massage.
Ohh, you are so weird and wonderful.
And if we move your coffee table,
Lawan could give me one, too.
God, no wonder Frost is mad at you.
I'm sorry.
Well, tell him, not me.
No, I'm apologizing to you, too.
For what, Maura?
This isn't very relaxing, by the way.
I think I was really talking to you
when I told Neda to follow her own path.
So you think Casey should be the one to give up everything?
Well, I like the idea of that
better than the idea of you on an army base,
serving mint juleps to Casey's officers.
Don't worry.
Really?
Yeah, I'm sure they all drink beer.
Angong, hit her!
It's yours.
What do you say?
Thank you.
You're welcome. How's your arm feeling?
Okay.
Kind of wish you guys had better band-aids.
Really? Okay.
I'll look into that. What, like -- like spider-man?
You ever seen the bacon-shaped ones?
Bacon? Okay.
That sounds cool. Okay.
Kev, can you tell me what happened yesterday?
It's okay. Honey, you're not in trouble.
You should tell Detective Rizzoli everything, okay?
The clown said he had a puppy.
He said if I guessed how big his feet were,
he'd give me the puppy.
Is that why you got in the car?
Yeah.
Oh, my God.
But you threw your backpack out the window, though, didn't you?
Yeah...
Yeah.
...when I knew something bad was gonna happen.
That was really, really smart.
Excuse me.
Be right back.
I ran a tox screen, looking for sedatives.
Kevin tested positive for valium.
Okay, thanks.
Did the clown give you anything to eat or drink?
Yeah. He gave me some milk and some cookies.
Is that why he doesn't remember anything?
Was there something in the milk?
There was valium.
Hey. Thank you very much.
Thanks for finding me.
Is it okay if I get a hug?
Yeah.
Okay.
Good. Come here.
You did great.
Okay.
Pack up, then. Thanks.
Damn it.
Ground-penetrating radar team didn't find remains?
Searched every inch of Brent Miller's place.
Nothing.
I've been digging into his background.
He worked at his father's car wash
while he got his teaching credential,
left Boston in August of '88
to take a teaching job in Philadelphia.
That would have been after Nick Hamilton's disappearance.
Any missing kids or clown sightings in Philly?
Nope.
Miller didn't even have parking tickets.
Where did he go for 25 years?
Flea-hopping from school to school,
up and down the east coast.
They chased him out.
I made calls to the schools where he worked.
Nobody would talk.
Once he was a teacher, he didn't need a clown costume.
He had access to all the boys he wanted.
They put him on indefinite paid leave at his last job.
Molestation's hard to prove.
Most boys don't want to testify.
I'm not sure I would.
What's going on between you and Dr. Isles?
Nothing.
You're a bad liar, Frost.
The crime lab compared the footprint we found
at the first kidnapping scene yesterday
to the clown shoe that Brent was wearing.
They match.
Makes sense.
Brent tried to grab Zack,
and then killed Reynolds when he tried to stop him.
I don't think it was Brent Miller.
What?
Miller weighed 225 pounds.
And whoever made this impression weighed less than 175 pounds.
So, two different men wore the shoes?
We got two clowns?
It's the only explanation.
So, who killed Reynolds?
Got a toxicology report back,
and Miller had valium in his system.
You found valium in Miller and the boy?
That's odd.
And both had enough to render them unconscious.
Then how did Brent kill himself?
I don't think he could have.
Did you see anything on his body
to indicate he might have been tied up?
No. No ligature marks.
The only thing I noticed...
This.
What's that from?
Contact dermatitis.
Wait.
Wait, that could be from...
From what? What are you looking for?
This.
He could have been bound to the chair
that we found him in with ace bandages.
That would explain the patch of dermatitis.
That's a pretty effective restraint.
It wouldn't have left any traces if it hadn't touched his skin
where he was perspiring.
So, this is Miller with Kevin.
But we know it wasn't Miller who tried to grab Zack
because of the footprint evidence.
Seems like someone wants us to think the clown is back.
Somebody framed Brent Miller.
It makes sense to frame him for a current kidnapping
if he got away with Nick Hamilton's kidnapping in '88.
Wait a minute.
What if Miller molested other boys 25 years ago?
He left Boston, comes back.
What if a grown-up victim saw him
and decided it was payback time?
Frankie, can you grab the incident reports,
the ones of the kids that claimed
they saw that clown in '88?
There aren't that many.
The three attempted kidnapping victims,
Nick Hamilton, and, uh...
Oh, this one.
Derrick Johnson, 8.
There's a note here -- "See additional information."
Well, the detective's notes are in the archives.
And there's also a VHS tape
with an interview with the kid -- I can get 'em.
Carol Lewis is the detective. She retired about 10 years ago.
Yeah, grab everything you can find.
Let's see what that boy has to say.
Okay.
德里克·约翰逊
Derrick says a clown dressed like an American flag
grabbed him at turtle pond
and molested him behind the big rocks.
So, why didn't detective Lewis go forward with the case?
Must have been something wrong with the case.
She was a good cop, really competent.
I got it up.
Play it.
Now, Derrick, why did you wait two weeks
to tell your mom and dad that the clown bothered you?
I don't know.
Were you afraid you might get in trouble?
I was scared.
He didn't want me to tell.
He? Who? The clown?
No. I mean, I didn't want to.
He's lying. Who's "He"?
What did the clown do?
H-he saw us fishing.
"Us." Did you hear that?
He came out of the woods...
He was with someone.
The clown was in the woods?
Why is the clown in the woods at turtle pond?
What? You're talking.
Why were you in the woods?
I mean I wanted to fish at night.
He said it again! "We."
There was no way that kid was out there by himself.
And it got dark, and then I saw a face.
And I got scared.
And the face saw me, and it was the clown.
There's no way I'm going to sleep tonight.
Me, either.
Derrick Johnson would be 33 now.
Frost, find out where he is.
When did they pave over the trails at turtle pond?
Oh, so I can talk now?
1988.
I only remember 'cause I wanted to
ride my bike on the new paths, and ma wouldn't let me
because there was a crazed clown in Boston.
1988.
We're onto something.
What if Brent Miller left his job at the car wash,
and on his way home
put the clown mask on to dump Nick Hamilton's body?
Yeah, you can drive a car right up to where
Derrick said they were fishing.
You could bury the body on one of the dirt paths,
knowing it was gonna be paved over.
Okay, let's do a search at turtle pond
with a ground-penetrating radar.
Derrick Johnson lives in town.
Look at his weight -- 169 pounds.
Right in line with the clown-shoe impressions.
He had his license revoked for D.U.I.'s.
Pretty good rap sheet.
Tried to commit suicide in custody.
Being molested as a kid would sure give him motive now.
He lives in a men's shelter.
Let's go pick him up.
Derrick, do you know this man?
No.
What about him?
Don't show me that. I hate clowns.
You hate clowns because of
what this man did to you, don't you?
I was...
8 years old.
And... I just wanted to have an adventure.
You know, see what it was like to fish at night
for trout in turtle pond.
What happened?
He said...
"Hey, slugger. Catch anything?"
And then he...
then he caught me.
It must have made you very angry.
I hated him.
I hated what he did.
I hated what happened to me...
Because of him.
I still do.
Did you hate him enough to kill him?
Yeah.
Wouldn't you?
Excuse me. It's important.
I compared Derrick's DNA in CODIS
to the DNA in the skin cells
found in the scrapings from under Reynolds' fingernails.
It's not Derrick's DNA.
But...?
I did find common markers.
So, our killer is someone related to Derrick?
Closely related.
They found a body at turtle pond.
Is it a boy?
Yeah.
And after that,
you just push the drawer in like that.
It's that easy!
Mm-hmm. That's all you have to do, bud.
All right.
Hi.
Eli, uh...
call mom and tell her to come pick you up, okay?
Yeah. Okay.
All right, bud.
Oh, it's great news
about that, uh -- the boy, Kevin.
Yeah. Yeah. I'm relieved.
So, you need my statement?
No.
This is you
and your little brother Derrick at turtle pond, isn't it?
Yeah.
Yeah. Why?
You tried to kidnap a boy yesterday.
You ended up killing an innocent man --
a good Samaritan who tried to stop you.
No, I don't -- I don't know what you're talking about.
I brought you guys the boy's backpack. Do you remember?
You were driving Brent's car, weren't you?
And when Kevin threw the backpack out the window,
you knew you had to come back,
because your fingerprints were on it.
N-no.
You first tried to grab Zack,
but that went south when you killed a man.
But you had no choice, did you?
'Cause you already had Brent Miller tied up in his basement,
so you had to go through with your plan, grab another boy.
I don't know a Brent Miller.
No?
Okay, well, then you
wouldn't mind giving us a sample of your DNA.
If you'll just chew on your cheek.
We can do a swab and be done.
Show us your hands!
I know you want us to think you got a gun under there.
Don't let it end like this.
No. End it.
Shoot me.
No.
Show us your hands.
Think about your son, Craig. Don't do this to him.
Come on.
There you go.
Okay.
You wanted the world to know
what he did to your little brother, didn't you?
You saw Derrick.
How many lives did that man ruin, huh?
You animal.
You perverted piece of crap.
Did he molest you, too?
Is that why you put the gun to his head
and pulled the trigger?
We have credit-card receipts.
Brent came into your store and bought supplies.
You recognized his voice, didn't you?
He called my son...
"slugger."
Why would you do it like this, Craig?
You traumatized two little boys.
I didn't mean to.
It just got out of control.
But I owed Derrick that much.
'Cause I wanted that pedophile to admit it,
you know, to expose him for who he was.
You wanted to do more than expose him.
Yeah, I wanted him dead.
You're under arrest, Craig.
Can I say goodbye to my boy?
Yeah.
Is Angong booked?
I can call her.
No, don't. I want to wallow.
What an awful case.
And he's still mad at me.
Did you apologize?
Yes. Repeatedly.
He'll get over it.
I'm still mad.
I'm still sorry.
I'm still wallowing.
This sucks.
We know of two nice Thai masseuses.
Excuse me?
Certified massage therapists, Detective Frost,
from the prestigious Lotus Palm School.
Mm-hmm. And who hasn't heard of the Lotus Palm School?
Okay. Well, in that case...
I get Angong.
Wait. You can't call dibs. You had her last time.
Frost, can you give us a second? I can too call dibs.
You cannot have Angong every, single time!
I can too have Angong every, single time!
