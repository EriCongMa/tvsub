i &apos;m gonna spend some time at home , be with the baby .
if you have any doubts about your husband ,
you can &apos;t go through with this adoption .
if there is even one shred of doubt --
i can &apos;t do it .
you &apos;re not ready .
you leak classified data in the name of improving security .
i was authorized to start the bidding process .
authorized by whom ?
what the hell are you doing in my house ?
you &apos;re the dirty rat , diane .
we came into the post office to make a point .
you talk too much .
土耳其 伊斯坦布尔
i didn &apos;t know anything about the safety deposit box
until i saw the will .
i &apos;ve had all the necessary paperwork certified --
the trust and ... the death certificate .
the paperwork is in order .
but to access your husband &apos;s box ,
you will need the key .
is there anything else ?
no . thank you .
i &apos;m terribly sorry for your loss , mrs. reddington .
the box in istanbul .
it &apos;s been cleared out .
this was left behind .
i was just starting to feel the endorphins
vibrating in my spleen .
the key .
how did you get it ?
macau . last winter .
i &apos;ve always hated macau .
no , thank you .
the documents in the box are worth over $ 10 million .
you stood me up in florence .
i had to get your attention somehow .
i have a proposition .
in that case , perhaps we should move to your room .
i &apos;ll take the check .

right . no .
okay , sure . yeah , no , i @-@ i &apos;ll talk to you soon .
right .
oh , that was , uh , brian .
he and katie say hi .
did you tell him ?
why would i tell him ?
i thought he &apos;d ask .
i just told him it &apos;s taking longer than we expected .
i know this is hard .
we spent six months talking about adoption .
we spent another year going through the process .
i know .
i &apos;m sorry .
yeah , i &apos;m sorry , too .
katie &apos;s pregnant .
that &apos;s great .
we should , um , get them something .
have them over for dinner ?
wait . tom , don &apos;t just walk away while we &apos;re talking !
she &apos;s breathtakingly unattractive ,
but she &apos;s worth over $ 40 million --
the only vermeer in private hands .
that &apos;s considered a masterpiece ?
last night , i got up for a scoop of orange sherbet ,
and she caught my eye .
i just stood here in the dark squinting at her .
poor thing ruined my appetite .
even after i went back to bed ,
all i could hear was the hideous music she must be playing .
didn &apos;t sleep a wink .
why did you buy it ?
oh , my god , no . she &apos;s not mine .
she belongs to some hedge @-@ fund manager who lives here .
i thought you lived here .
well , for now .
the owner &apos;s been on vacation
ever since the s.e.c. started its investigation .
i &apos;ve never met the man ,
but his housekeeper is an old friend .
please .
do you have any idea how much the u.s. government has spent
on signals intelligence in the past year ?
no . - your country has become a nation of eavesdroppers --
frequency domains , triangulation ,
satellites , crypto @-@ whatever .
you &apos;ve forgotten that what matters most
is human intelligence --
alliances , relationships , seduction .
madeline pratt is a master at --
madeline pratt ? madeline pratt --
is a thief ...
and a woman of ...
singular talents .
and now you want something of hers
and you expect the fbi to help you get it .
it was the right decision ...
not to have the baby .
what did she take from you ?
i &apos;m sorry for ... your suffering .
madeline pratt . how do we find her ?
finding her is easy .
catch her is difficult .
luckily , she &apos;s asked me to help her plan a heist .
to steal what ?
the effigy of atargatis .
the effigy was thought to be lost ,
disappeared from the british museum in 1983 .
two months ago ,
it pops up at an estate sale in henderson , kentucky .
the feds raided the auction
and paraded it back the syrians .
ah , here it is -- the effigy .
novak , i have friends
who are looking for this funny little statue ,
and they &apos;re not the least bit interested in antiquities .
what is the real story ?
the kungur six .
it &apos;s said that when the cold war was ending ,
its owner hid a list inside the effigy ,
a list of soviet spies .
why is that relevant today ?
the kungur six are still active and are said to be responsible
for some of the most damaging intelligence breaches
in the past 30 years .
find the effigy , and you find them .
finding them would be
the holy grail of u.s. counterintelligence .
you allowed him to vet everyone that works here ?
i made no promises .
but i understand it was a precondition of his return ,
that aside from security and principal staff ,
everyone else has to be off @-@ site .
i agreed to his terms to get him in here .
where we go from here is up to me .
excuse me .
that &apos;s great .
harold , look at you !
sit down .
no , no , no . i &apos;m fine , thank you .
i was just looking at the pictures of charlene and the kids .
how old are they now ? the kids , not charlene .
diane fowler . where is she ?
i have no idea .
and frankly , i &apos;m flummoxed as to why you would even care .
you expect me to believe that you walk in here
after she vanishes and there &apos;s no connection ?
has diane gone missing ?
perhaps you should ask agent malik .
she works for the woman , doesn &apos;t she ?
i &apos;ve had no contact .
well , there you go .
you made it clear . you thought we had a mole .
and you wouldn &apos;t set foot inside this facility
until that mole was captured or dead .
who decided on this paneling ?
you told us you wouldn &apos;t come in until the mole had been caught .
i said nothing of the kind .
you said our house wasn &apos;t clean . is it ?
i suppose you &apos;ll have to ask diane fowler when you find her .
when we find out what &apos;s happened to her --
and we will find out --
if you had anything to do with it ,
you &apos;re gonna spend the rest of your life in a box .
understood ?
you smell nice . something new ?
did you hear me ?
madeline pratt .
what about her ?
this is the madeline pratt you all know and love --
politically active , influential , a good citizen .
what you don &apos;t know is the madeline pratt that i love .
$ 6 million in diamonds
stolen from a de beers outpost in the congo .
security fibers used in printing the czech koruna ,
taken from a mint in prague
and used to produce counterfeit bank notes .
the madeline pratt you know
fosters relationships with incredibly powerful people .
the one you don &apos;t exploits those relationships
in ways that impact national security .
well , we can &apos;t just arrest her . we have no evidence .
what you do have is an opportunity ,
which brings us back to the effigy of atargatis .
madeline feels her profile is too high right now
to steal it herself , so she &apos;s asked for my help .
where is the effigy ?
secure wing in the syrian embassy ... for now .
but it will likely be repatriated at any moment ,
which means maddie is rushed and vulnerable .
she &apos;s trying to make a grab
that would normally take months to plan .
do the syrians know what &apos;s inside the effigy ?
if they did , it would be in damascus by now .
i can only assume , harold ,
that madeline has a russian patron ,
since it &apos;s the russians
who want to protect the identities of the kungur six .
i &apos;m not sanctioning an op
in support of you going in to steal anything ,
let alone something that may affect national security .
i &apos;m flattered that you think i &apos;m up to it ,
but thieving is not my strongest suit .
luckily , we have an ace of spades among us .
isn &apos;t that right , agent keen ?
what &apos;s he talking about ?
is there something you want to tell us ?
no , sir .
your father &apos;s criminal record
didn &apos;t show up on your background report .
maybe yours is missing , too .
i don &apos;t have a criminal record .
because you never committed a crime ,
or because you were never caught ?
yes . i believe my work speaks for itself .
sir , i can do this .
all right . we take the case .
but understand , if you do this , you &apos;re gonna be on foreign soil .
if something goes wrong , we can &apos;t protect you .
i need to know about you , how you respond under pressure .
this is an embassy .
security , cameras , armed guards everywhere .
one mistake , and you go to prison .
nicole here is as calm as a hindu cow .
tell her that story about frank .
who &apos;s frank ?
a guy i knew .
what story ?
we met in high school . we grifted .
small jobs really ,
just whatever we had to do to pay the rent .
tell her about omaha .
i was 17 .
there was a drugstore . thursday night .
they made bank deposits on friday .
i was the lookout . the night manager came back .
he forget his glasses .
i gave the signal , but ... nothing .
i &apos;d convinced myself
that frank was the only thing i had in the world , so ...
the night manager was an easy decision .
what did you --
i seduced him into the alley .
and then what ?
i played him for a little bit , then i kissed him off ,
told him he &apos;d get more next week .
and frank and i went away .
and lived happily ever after . the end .
i thought you didn &apos;t believe in happily ever after .
i didn &apos;t come here to audition .
wait . the job . it &apos;s yours .
i don &apos;t want the job . call somebody who does .
how did you get my phone ?
what if i paid you double ?
see , this is what i love about the two of you .
headstrong , yet vulnerable . confident , but cautious .
i think you &apos;re gonna get along great .
your name will be on the guest list .
the statue &apos;s in a u.l.-approved class i vault
situated in a strong room
one level below the ground floor .
how long will it take to breach ?
an autodialer can circumvent the electronic keypad
in two , maybe three minutes tops .
i &apos;ll supply equipment that can get through a metal detector .
what about physical security ?
there are two guards stationed outside that strong room ,
armed and mobile .
they do a hall sweep every 20 minutes .
when they take their patrol at 9 : 20,
you &apos;ll have 10 minutes .
how do i get in ?
dirar marwan , embassy official .
he has the security credentials you &apos;ll need
to get to the structure &apos;s classified lower level .
he takes a coffee break every day at 4 : 00 pm ,
wears his i.d. on the lapel of his jacket ,
easy enough to unclip in a standard brush pass .
this lift needs to be round trip , not one way .
can &apos;t raise any flags .
i know someone who can clone his badge
before marwan can return to the embassy .
okay , here we go .
you good ?
i will be in 90 seconds .
what &apos;s that ?
it &apos;s madeline pratt &apos;s sim card .
i swiped it when i palmed her phone .
if i &apos;m gonna do this ,
i want to know who she talks to and why .
you know how to palm a phone ?
how will you return his badge ?
i won &apos;t .
you will , in a second brush pass
before he re @-@ enters the building .
he &apos;s coming .
we have about 15 seconds . hurry .
how are we doing on marwan &apos;s i.d. ?
how long you need ?
almost there .
okay , 30 seconds .
he &apos;s on the move . i need the badge now .
somebody stall him .
we ... are a go .
oh , my god .
i &apos;m so sorry .
it &apos;s fine .
it &apos;s all right .
good .
did you get it on him ?
yes .
hey , um , i &apos;m sorry . i , uh , broke our rule .
i shouldn &apos;t have walked away upset .
brian and katie are having a kid .
it &apos;s hard .
whoa , mama .
hey , is this like an undercover thing tonight ?
&apos;cause , uh , if you need a partner ,
i &apos;ve got some pretty good fake i.d.s.
zip me up .
hey , i wanted to ask you something .
so , um , you know i have
that , uh , teacher conference in orlando this weekend ,
and i was thinking you should come with me .
you know , just sunshine and beaches
and get away from all this .
um , orlando &apos;s landlocked .
i &apos;m pretty sure there aren &apos;t any beaches .
and that &apos;s why i don &apos;t teach geography .
i would love that .
yeah ?
we could use a vacation .
tell me about it .
just you and me .
do you want to maybe go undercover
before you ... go undercover ?
we have a problem .
i had my people run background
on the guest list for tonight &apos;s event .
the file &apos;s on the ottoman .
rasil kalif -- notorious playboy --
works as a cultural attaché in the syrian embassy .
apparently , madeline &apos;s been seeing him for some time .
why is that a problem ?
cultural attaché is kalif &apos;s cover .
truth is he &apos;s been recruited as an asset
by the russian bratva -- he &apos;s a mobster .
my guess is he &apos;s the one who hired maddie
to steal the effigy .
and right about now ,
she &apos;s walking into the embassy as his date .
what ?
you said her profile was too high and she wasn &apos;t going .
well , she is .
why would she hire us to steal the effigy
when she &apos;s obviously planning on stealing it herself ?
and i like your clutch .
what are you wearing ?
a tuxedo .
i &apos;m your plus one .
you can &apos;t get into that embassy .
oh , yes , i can .
some of my best friends are syrian .
you act like this is a joke .
there &apos;s a digital net over the embassy .
aram can &apos;t access the surveillance feeds .
i &apos;m going onto foreign soil to steal a priceless artifact
with no backup .
you have me .
and i &apos;m not gonna let anything happen to you .
you wanted to see me , sir ?
close the door .
i meant what i said to reddington .
this thing with fowler --
wherever she is , whatever happened --
i &apos;m gonna get to the bottom of it .
diane and i didn &apos;t have a lot in common ,
but she put this task force together , made it possible .
without her , none of this would ever have happened .
you &apos;re talking in the past tense .
agent malik ,
you know as well as i that diane fowler
is never walking into this facility again .
as far as i &apos;m concerned , this is a murder investigation ,
and reddington is our chief suspect .
he was clearly convinced that fowler was our mole .
i don &apos;t care what he thinks .
even if reddington &apos;s right and fowler was dirty ,
he &apos;s not judge , jury , and executioner .
he can &apos;t just kill her . that &apos;s not the way it works .
find out what he knows . who did he talk to ?
what evidence did he have ?
i want to know everything .
there &apos;s madeline .
think she beat us to it ?
stay on task .
we have two minutes to access the security door .
shall we ?
lizzy , i know this must be very difficult for you ,
but we can &apos;t both lead .
how did you know about omaha ?
i didn &apos;t .
you &apos;re the one who brought it up .
well , it was a heartwarming story .
the night manager and the alley .
i made it up .
you &apos;re not a cop tonight . you &apos;re a criminal .
and you &apos;re gonna be fine . just be yourself .
the security door is behind you .
20 feet on your right .
okay , i &apos;m gonna need a distraction .
be yourself .
mind if i cut in ?
what are you doing here , madeline ?
what are you doing here , red ?
i came to watch you .
thank you .
you still wear the hell out of a tux .
my plane is 15 minutes from here .
we could be in tegucigalpa by breakfast .
the girl -- tell me about her .
what would you like to know ?
how did you pick her ?
fate .
she &apos;s a little young for you .
you think ?
last summer , what happened in florence ?
what happened to you ? you left me alone .
i deserve an explanation .
i was serious about tegucigalpa .
what do you think ?
right now .
what happened in florence ?
come ! i need to get you to the safe room .
all embassy dignitaries will head to the safe room .
quick , quick . quick . quick , quick .
hurry .
there was a man . he had a gun . the man had a gun .
suspect spotted in stairwell a @-@ 2 .
reddington ! it &apos;s him !
he &apos;s the one who did this ! call security !
there you are ! what the hell happened to you ? !
you just leave me stranded with that awful algerian ? !
he &apos;s been hitting on me for 20 minutes !
sir , this is a secure area !
well , not secure enough if you ask me , sister .
you know what ? why don &apos;t you ask rasil ?
we wouldn &apos;t even be here
if it weren &apos;t for that troublemaker .
always an agenda with him .
cultural attache . culture my ass .
the things i do for this one .
gallivanting around the globe
for your little assignations with you @-@ know @-@ hmm @-@ hmm ,
cher furs and bikinis
as if i wouldn &apos;t rather be back in dutchess county
with my shelties .
hey , don &apos;t take anything for granted !
everything you have was bought and paid for by your boyfriend !
do you have any idea whose horn this tramp is blowing ?
let &apos;s just say it starts with bashar and ends with assad ,
gassing you faster than a sunni .
so , let &apos;s get her out of the hot seat
and into a limo -- good god !
crumbs up !
what ?
your cummerbund . pleats up !
you look like bob yoshimura in 8th @-@ grade swing choir .
it &apos;s upside down !
god , that hurts !
what the hell was that ?
i don &apos;t know .
it just felt so right in the moment .
where &apos;s pratt ?
gone .
and the effigy ?
gone with her .
i have what you want .
when you &apos;ve wired payment ,
i &apos;ll contact you with the location of the effigy .
if i don &apos;t hear from you within the hour , it &apos;s gone .
what the hell with reddington ?
he told me he &apos;s going to try and locate pratt .
for all we know , he set up this whole thing
so he could get the identities of the russian spies
damaging national security .
the syrians know the safe was opened as a distraction ,
and they &apos;re still trying to account for
exactly who was in that panic room with the effigy .
they &apos;re attributing the whole heist to reddington .
she knew where the effigy was the entire time ,
and she used us to get it .
she got me to set off the alarm ,
and she used reddington &apos;s notoriety
to get the syrians to believe that he took it .
we got something .
the sim card keen took from pratt &apos;s phone .
this is a list of outgoing calls she made
over the past two weeks .
several of these calls were to a mosque outside of arlington .
homeland has a person of interest tied to that mosque --
a cleric named firas ashear .
and he &apos;s connected how ?
we &apos;re not sure .
but the biggest red flag is his family &apos;s connection
to the people &apos;s liberation alliance .
extremist organization out of aleppo .
apparently , the father is a local warlord
with financial ties to the group .
find him .
bring him in for questioning .
tickets have been booked , bags are being packed ,
and we are all set to fly out first thing tomorrow .
tom ...
don &apos;t tell me . work .
there &apos;s nothing i can do .
there &apos;s never anything you can do
because your job has now become our life .
what do you want me to say ?
you don &apos;t have to say anything .
you know what ? i &apos;m gonna change my ticket .
i &apos;m gonna fly out tonight .
tonight ? what ? wait .
no , i &apos;m not gonna wait .
i think some time apart might be the best thing for us .
that is the last thing i want .
it &apos;s not always about what you want , liz .
you want me to rough him up for you ?
i hate this job .
how do you know madeline pratt ?
she called me last month , asked about the effigy .
i &apos;d never met her before ,
and i don &apos;t know how she found me .
so , why &apos;d she call you , then ?
because the effigy of atargatis once belonged to my father .
he stole it from the british museum .
he was a patriot who revered atargatis .
he thought it belonged in syria .
then why put it up for auction ?
he didn &apos;t .
as i told ms. pratt ,
my father only possessed the effigy for a few months ...
until the americans raided our compound .
what were they looking for ?
all i remember is opening a door
and seeing him holding the statue .
he slipped something inside it , a piece of paper .
what did it say ?
i don &apos;t know .
but he placed the effigy in my arms
and told me to run and protect it .
i was 7 .
when the americans found me ,
they took the statue as a trophy .
they let me go , but ...
my father ...
what happened to your father ?
i never saw him again .
for me , that was the day he died .
the cia sanctioned a covert op to raid the compound
of al hakam ashear in early december 1983 .
the agency received credible intelligence
that ashear had met with a former kgb agent
to purchase information .
what kind of information ?
ashear paid $ 3 million
for the location of the kungur six ,
which , according to the son &apos;s story ,
he hid in the base of the statue .
so , it appears the six aren &apos;t people .
what do you mean ?
during the cold war , there were rumors
that russia was able to
hide several nuclear weapons in america .
those weren &apos;t rumors .
pratt was hired to steal the effigy
because inside it are directions to those weapons .
the kungur six are not russian agents .
they &apos;re nuclear bombs .
hidden all across the country .
tell me about the coordinates .
what coordinates ?
stop it .
i had a little talk with rasil .
we had a few laughs , compared notes about you .
he told me all about that delightful thing you do
with a trouser belt , which was a bit hurtful ,
since i was pretty sure it was our thing .
the coordinates .
it &apos;s over . you were played . go home .
you really want to know why i brought you into this ?
florence . because you didn &apos;t show .
florence was everything ,
our way out , a fresh start .
but to you , it &apos;s all just a job .
tegucigalpa ? honestly ?
if i was interested in having an affair ,
i &apos;d find a man with hair .
raymond .
raymond , is that you ?
raymond , say something .
ra @-@ 115 suitcase nukes .
this is the kind of device
the kgb would smuggle into the u.s. at the time .
each bomb has about 50 pounds of high @-@ explosive material ,
blast radius of nearly 2,000 feet .
you place one of these near a high @-@ profile target ,
the fallout alone guarantees mass casualties .
get a nest team on standby .
where are we on kalif ?
we confirmed reddington &apos;s allegation .
rasil kalif is an asset
working undercover for the russian mafia .
if they get their hands on these nukes ,
god knows who they may sell them to .
the syrians aren &apos;t getting the effigy back .
it &apos;s gone .
i &apos;ve already sold it to the russians .
i ran out of gas .
huh ?
i was so excited to get home ,
i didn &apos;t even bother to look .
my head was just ...
i ran out of gas .
what are you talking about ?
it was christmas eve .
i ...
pulled off to the side of the road .
seemed like it &apos;d been snowing for days .
no traffic . no cars to come help .
just me and a car full of gifts .
it was more than 20 years ago .
i must have walked four miles .
five , maybe .
it was so still .
just cold and white .
the whole time ,
all i could think about was them in our house .
the warm light in the windows , the smoke from the chimney .
the sound of my daughter at the piano .
the smell of the tree and the fire ,
oyster stew on the stove .
i was so upset to think that i &apos;d ruined christmas for them ,
being wait , leaving the gifts in the car .
but the closer i got ,
the more i realized how funny the whole thing was ,
how much they &apos;d love the story ,
daddy running out of gas ,
how every christmas they &apos;d get such joy
from telling that story at my expense .
and then , finally ...
i got there .
i walked ...
i walked through the door .
and there was ...
just blood .
all i saw was blood .
all there was was blood .
i can ...
i can still s @-@ smell the nape of her neck ...
feel her little ...
fingers on my cheek ...
her whisper in my ear .
that &apos;s why i didn &apos;t show up in florence .
it &apos;s why i haven &apos;t shown up
in a lot of places over the years .
no , don &apos;t .
please , please .
no , please ! stop !
please stop ! please stop !
please come back !
i &apos;ll tell you what you want to know !
now , i gave you what you wanted . where is he ?
no .
we have the location of the effigy .
you son of a ...
yes .
you &apos;ll never get to it in time .
damn you , reddington !
damn you , raymond !
you let me out of here right now , you son of a bitch !
was it true ?
that story about your family ?
was any of it true ?
we should have gone to tegucigalpa .
we have to assume we &apos;re late to the party , so ...
watch your backs .
come on .
go ! go !
clear . clear .
rasil &apos;s just bailed out !
cover !
e.r.t. examined the statue .
there was nothing inside , no coordinates .
no papers of any kind ,
nothing on kalif or any of his men .
it appears madeline sent us
on a good old @-@ fashioned snipe hunt .
i sent a team to the warehouse
where you said we could find pratt .
she was gone . where is she ?
let &apos;s talk about the effigy .
why ?
the idea that it actually contained anything
was obviously a myth .
or maybe madeline double @-@ crossed the russians
and kept the coordinates to the nukes for herself
and led you to believe it was all a myth .
you have them .
while you were chasing the effigy , i was ...
coming to terms with madeline .
in a moment of ...
weakness , she gave me the coordinates .
you knew there was nothing inside the effigy
when you sent us after kalif .
i thought you might have a passing interest
in rounding up some russian mobsters .
the coordinates . where are they ?
relax , harold .
i have no use for rusty russian firecrackers
left over from the &apos; 60s .
you want the effigy .
and you want the bombs .
how about a trade ?
hi , you &apos;ve reached tom keen .
i &apos;m away from my phone right now , but leave a message-
case file on pratt .
you taking off already ?
yeah . meeting audrey for dinner .
i think he &apos;s gonna leave me .
no . go .
you have dinner .
she &apos;ll understand .
hi . uh , tom keen checking in .
mr. keen . alone , right ?
hello .
may i help you ?
special agent walter gary martin .
d.c. bureau .
let me just start by saying
the director really values all the work you &apos;re doing here .
personally , i can &apos;t think of anyone
better suited for the job .
your office said you wanted to talk about diane fowler .
absolutely .
i tell you what .
i &apos;ve heard people talk about the post office ,
but this facility ...
now , look , i don &apos;t want to sound any alarm bells ,
but i &apos;ve become aware of the fact
that you &apos;ve tasked one of your agents
to investigate the disappearance of diane fowler .
is that a problem ?
the disappearance of the head of the criminal division
is a situation we need to manage ... carefully .
what does that mean ?
