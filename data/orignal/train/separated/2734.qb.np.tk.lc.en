sorry .
it &apos;s a whole new world .

no . i didn &apos;t look at the brand name when i picked it up .
it just looked like mine , that &apos;s all .
i gave you that briefcase for christmas , ton &apos; .
i know , honey . i know .
his license has a kingman , arizona ,
address and no phone is listed .
what &apos;s in the briefcase ? did you look ?
yeah , of course i looked .
there &apos;s a bunch of brochures
for solar heating systems . no company name .
he &apos;ll get in touch .
that was a great lecture .

nothing .
try not to worry , ton &apos; .
my whole life &apos;s in that case . thank you .

i am sorry , but we &apos;re completely booked .
you &apos;re kidding . - i &apos;m afraid not .
there &apos;s six conventions in town . you might try the omni .
trouble is i lost my wallet ,
so how the hell am i going to check in there without a credit card ?
you &apos;d face the same problem here .
yeah , but i stayed here as a guest just last night .
you couldn &apos;t sign on that bill , you &apos;ve already closed it out .
thanks for being so helpful .
hi .
what can i get you ?
well , i don &apos;t know if you remember me ,
but i was in here last night around 8 : 00 .
i was sitting right over there .
i ordered the blackened grouper sandwich then i canceled .
said i had pains in my stomach . - vaguely , okay ...
well , when i was leaving , i picked up a wallet and a briefcase
and i thought they were mine ,
but they weren &apos;t .
oh , jesus .
you don &apos;t happen to remember who was sitting next to me ?
you know , there was a guy .
he was about your height .
you know the reason i remember is he &apos;d had that grouper sand too
and i was afraid we &apos;d mess the orders up . i think he left before you .
and he never came back ?
no .
you know the name kevin finnerty ?
he drives a lexus .
you know him ?
it &apos;s a joke . infinity ? lexus ?
i imagine you could use one on the house .
yeah , yeah . you said a mouthful .
uh , scotch rocks .
all right .
glenlivet okay ?
oh yeah , better than okay .
well , might as well hang out here
in case he shows or calls .
you realize i can &apos;t even get on a plane without a picture id ?
oh , god , that &apos;s right .
well , tell me about costa mesa .
nice place to live ?
around here ? it &apos;s dead .
give me the grouper sandwich .

a few of us are getting a table .
dude lost his wallet and briefcase .

we &apos;ll all pound his ass . okay , thanks .
u. s. drill bit . aerospace and industrial equipment .
we just sold our gear and coupling unit to wheela @-@ brator
to focus on pumps and compressors .
interesting .
tony ,
you never did tell us how you made the jump
from selling patio furniture to precision optics .
well , like my wife says , that &apos;s a good question .
excuse me for one minute .
hi , daddy . i made volleyball .

how &apos;s your brother ?
mom put him to bed early . he puked .
oh , no. ls she around ?
mom ! bye , dad .
bye , baby .
ton &apos; , how ya doing ?
finnerty didn &apos;t call there , did he ?
no . i &apos;d have let you know right away .
where &apos;d jeff and kansas go ?
to bed , and they sucker @-@ punched you , buddy .
they paid the check .
you guys all had a hand in this , didn &apos;t you ?
listen , we &apos;re just impressed to be in the presence of a man
whose sales team snatched the brass ring
12 consecutive quarters .
it &apos;s not such a big deal .
there &apos;s always a faster gun .
i &apos;m 46 years old .
i mean , who am i ?
where am i going ?
join the club .
now is the time you can clearly hear his voice .
let us rejoice in his love .
this isn &apos;t going to happen .
what are you talking about ?
i saw your face when you got off the phone with your wife .
so ?
don &apos;t sweat it . it &apos;s sweet , actually .
but you talk about them back there a lot .
i could even be some other guy tonight
and get away with the whole shebang .
but no , i blow it .
they &apos;re looking for a perp .
his eyes are open . two , three .
he &apos;s bucking the vent . give me the lights .
i &apos;ll get some restraints .
four milligrams ativan .
he was just lying there peacefully just like he has been and then he just--
he &apos;s still bucking .
room three ! the gunshot .
he pulled his tubes out !
i have to retube him .
oh , god .
etomidate and sux and an airway box .
take the family out . - give us room to move .
please wait outside . - where &apos;s the ativan , please ?
i got him .
tony .
dad ?
mr. soprano .
tony ?
what , honey ?
who am i ? where am i going ?
we &apos;re right here with you . tony , who am i ?
get ready to retube him . sir , can you hear me ?
who am i ? where am i going ?
dad !
tony !
i &apos;m going to have to insist that you guys leave .
getting this breathing tube back in is something you &apos;re not gonna want to see .
what &apos;s going on ?
you &apos;re just getting back ?
matt &apos;s car wouldn &apos;t start .
yeah .
dad &apos;s not so good right now . they made us leave .
i got to go .
what &apos;s the latest ?
he came out of the coma for a minute .
they took the breathing tube out .
that &apos;s good , right ? that means he &apos;s breathing on his own .
they had to put the tube back in .
goddamn junior .
anthony soprano is not going to die .
i don &apos;t know what everybody &apos;s talking about .
nobody &apos;s saying he &apos;s going to die .
could one of you take these guys home , please ? 2 : 00 a. m .
you can &apos;t live in this icu . two nights straight is too much .
i &apos;m okay . mead spelled me last night .
i &apos;m staying tonight too .
i want you to go back .
okay , people call the house . i need somebody there .
ma , you want some tea ?
van helsing , let &apos;s go .
i &apos;ll take him .
i got it .
he &apos;s on my way . - bullshit , you live in bellevue .
what do you care ? - you already brought the sfogliatelle !
let &apos;s go .
got him back on the ventilator , mucus plug .
the bullet didn &apos;t just tear up the pancreas , it impacted the gall bladder .
sepsis is the big problem . an infection in the blood .
i &apos;ve got him sedated and restrained
so he can &apos;t pull his breathing tubes out .
okay , then what ?
as we discussed before ,
we &apos;re probably not looking at a very good outcome here .
should we call dr. plepler ?
i &apos;ll let him know . and taschlin too . he &apos;ll stop by .
does he know that he &apos;s dying ?
we don &apos;t know .
welcome to the omni . how may i help you ?
name is finnerty . i called and reserved a room .
yes , mr. finnerty , we have you down for a single room for the night .
did you wish to keep that on the visa ? uh , yeah .
i &apos;ll need to take an imprint to cover incidentals .
sure .
room 728 .
elevators are on your left .
have a good night . thank you .
good night . - night .
kevin finnerty ?
we thought we heard that man say your name .
how fortuitous we should meet up with you again .
you know him ?
this is important .
months you have ignored our letters and phone calls .
well , we are now filing suit against you .
no , okay , back up .
i &apos;m not kevin finnerty .
i have his wallet by mistake and i guess i look a little like him ?
so he is from around here ?
we had a horrible winter at the monastery
because of your heating system .
i &apos;m not kevin finnerty .
lose your arrogance .
son of a bitch !
hey ! hey , come on guys .
did you see ? he hit me ! don &apos;t let him-- he hit me !
you okay ?
don &apos;t let him go !
i was just trying to block your fall .
did you see that ?
why would i be joking ?
he slapped me in the mouth .
did you file a police report ?
i &apos;m staying here under somebody else &apos;s credit card .
you could &apos;ve explained that .
oh , you &apos;re so sure ?
it &apos;s fraud .
does the hotel know if there &apos;s a buddhist temple or anything around ?
they say there &apos;s more than one .
if i could find the place and i could get some words in edgewise ,
they might point me to finnerty .
but who wants more complications ? i just want to come home .
i know . you never even wanted to go to this conference .
i agree . you should just leave tomorrow and not go on to houston .
i &apos;ll wire you cash .
can i claim the cash without id ?
shit . that &apos;s a good question .
all right , i &apos;ll call doenitz ,
see if the company can help .
i miss you .
i miss you too ,
but you &apos;re off in your own world .
you &apos;re too distracted with work .
this is partly your fault .
call me later if you can &apos;t sleep .
love you .
love you .
good morning .
mead honey ?
how is he ?
the same .
but another night has passed and he is still with us .
he &apos;s not the same .
his fever dropped to 39.1 . that &apos;s 102 @-@ point @-@ something .
oh , dr. plepler . good morning .
hear we had a rumpus last night , huh ?
oh , god . it was awful .
how long since he left my o.r. ?
his amylase is 41 .
hematocrit still okay ?
yup .
good .
hi . how &apos;s my big brother doing today ?
everything &apos;s okay here .
you mean just the surgery per se ?
uh @-@ hmm .
well what about the sepsis ?
yeah , well that &apos;s the concern .
what did taschlin say this morning ?
dr. taschlin never came in here this morning .
well , no matter . i &apos;ll be talking to him .
go ahead and change the dressing , huh .
does this mean the chances
could be worse my husband could not come out of his coma ?
actually , now we &apos;ve induced coma .
what ? why ?
control the seizures while we try to knock down the fever with antibiotics .
it says his temperature &apos;s down some .
the problem here is not only
are we looking at the obvious negative outcome ,
but in these cases
we also contemplate degrees of brain damage
in the event he does survive .
what antibiotic is he on ?
zosyn .
sorry , doctor , she volunteered in an icu this summer .
columbia pres in new york . she &apos;s thinking about a career in medicine .
oh , good .
or law , i don &apos;t know .
good morning , doctor . i &apos;m the sister . we met yesterday .
look , you &apos;re all doing the right thing .
you &apos;re staying with him , keeping contact , but talk to him also .
keep him engaged . you might want to play some of his favorite music .
you know fortunately for him ,
he is at a level @-@ one trauma center .
or with his injuries , believe me , he would have been dead 12 hours ago .
okay , i see . thank you , doctor .
&quot; thank you , doctor &quot; ?
&quot; i &apos;m sorry , she volunteered at an icu &quot; ?
you treat these guys like rock stars .
he &apos;s the doctor , meadow .
well why bring up brain damage now ?
we &apos;ll cross that bridge if we have to .
i came by to help , guys . anything .
i left nica with bobby &apos;s mother .
you both should get some rest .
come on in and see him . your sister &apos;s here too .
oh , my god . oh , god . i can &apos;t get used to this . oh , my god .
oh , my god . i can &apos;t ...
i know , janice . i know .
get her some water . come here , sit down .
it &apos;s okay , it &apos;s okay .
that &apos;s my brother !
what are these ?
a watch and a pencil .
repeat the following sentence ,
&quot; no ifs , ands or buts . &quot;
i &apos;ll do it if i fucking feel like it .
take your ultimatums and stick them in your ass .
no , repeat the sentence .
what is this person talking about ? !
these people are trying to establish for the government ,
that if you shot anthony soprano , which we &apos;re not conceding ,
that it certainly wasn &apos;t intentional--
that you were confused and disoriented .
don &apos;t coach him , please .
my nephew anthony ?
that &apos;s why you &apos;re here in custody .
where &apos;s mel ?
you dismissed mr. melvoin as your attorney and hired me .
because of his paralyzed hand from his stroke , it made your nervous .
if somebody shot my nephew it was him himself .
he &apos;s a depression case .
you got any beefs ,
i &apos;m the one you come to .
likewise , weekly i &apos;ll collect for the skip .
i &apos;ll keep it for him until he &apos;s back on his feet ,
taking out a portion for carmela
to run the house and that shit there .
good .
absolutely .
anybody got any questions ?
for now , not personal questions relating to yourself ,
but about the family .
yeah , vito .
the sports book in roseville .
by rights , that should go to me now .
eugene was with me . - yo , what &apos;d i just say ? not about yourself !
what do we do about junior ?
he &apos;s in jail . that puts him out of our reach .
not necessarily .
he &apos;s a demented old fuck .
i say we do nothing . let him rot , sever all ties .
end this embarrassment right now .
he &quot; marvin gayed &quot; his own nephew , the boss of this family .
what happens to junior is tony &apos;s call .
that &apos;s right .
bobby ,
all due respect , where the fuck were you that night ?
why was the skipper babysitting junior ?
i had other family obligations .
ask my wife . tony volunteered .
are we done ? i &apos;m going back to the hospital .
he &apos;s gotta make an issue out of everything lately .
roseville &apos;s been junior &apos;s territory since the big bang ,
which means it goes to bobby now that junior &apos;s out of the picture .
vito already pulls down more scratch
than anybody , from the unions .
let him go to the hospital first ,
that fat fucking kiss @-@ ass .
i &apos;m buying tony a nice little stereo for the room .
he don &apos;t need that .
look at this fucking mutt .
who wouldn &apos;t like to take the easy way out ?
maybe the poor fuck was suffering
from inoperable cancer or some shit .
suicide runs in families .
maybe it was his mother or his old man
took the gas pipe when eugene was a kid .
his son , the drugs maybe .
i knew him better than anybody , but still ...
maybe he was a homo , felt there was nobody he could talk to about it .
that happens too .
good thing tony never heard about him killing himself , at least .
got enough on his plate .
the nurse told me she saw aj .
she did ?
i asked him to bring dad &apos;s tony bennett box set from home .
yeah , it &apos;s been kind of weird .
would you call it growing up soprano ?
i guess . i don &apos;t know .
come with me .
hold on there .
what did i tell you ?
we were just talking .
don &apos;t talk to them . say nothing .
where are your father &apos;s cds ?
i forgot .
oh jesus god , anthony .
everybody is pitching in here but you .
thanks , mom .
i wish you would go to class if this is all you &apos;re gonna do .
with my father in the hospital ?
go to the deli on broad street . get some bagels .
all right ? get enough for everybody upstairs , an assortment .
and go this way .
look . chris just sent this over .
a little stereo .
mead , my god , i &apos;m telling you ,
she seems like she &apos;s grown up so much . what she knows .
she will make a terrific doctor .
i got some cds from my car .
oh , yes , you like this one .
anthony , anthony .
ho , sheriff of nottingham .
my kingdom for a mortadella , huh ?
they make a great sandwich here . no getting around it .
what about that disease you picked up over there
in diarrhea @-@ stan or wherever the fuck you were ?
this might be the cure .
yeah , we &apos;re sorry to hear about tony .
i got nothing to say about what happened so--
that &apos;s not why i asked . how &apos;s he doing ?
he &apos;s fucked up . you know what i think ?
i think you don &apos;t come here for the sandwiches .
i think you come &apos; cause you miss us .
hey , i can &apos;t blame you . that job you got now must be depressing .
how goes the war on terror anyway ?
working it .
i heard fieldcrest reported a truckload of towels missing .
we actually spend a little more of our time trying to interdict
the financial networks that fund the terror cells worldwide .
no shit . - truck hijacking , narcotics .
in fact , if you ever heard of anything going down ,
middle easterners , pakistanis ,
you &apos;d be helping a lot if you picked up a phone .
and called you ?
it &apos;s your country too , isn &apos;t it ?
like i &apos;d know one of these suicide jerk @-@ offs if he bit me on the ass .
you knew matoush zhia . hung out at your girlfriend &apos;s club .
he was a drug dealer , her friend .
i didn &apos;t know shit about his politics till one of your people told me .
something to keep in mind .
i take that terrorism shit seriously .
and tony , don &apos;t even get him started .
this song was playing in your car
that entire weekend
we all went down to long beach island .
remember artie and charmaine broke up for the first time ?
first of many .
she accused him of letting her drown in the ocean . remember that ?
that wave picked her up
and slammed her down on her head in the sand ?
oh , my god , her around water .
and remember the time that she got cramps from eating that huge calzone ?
you had to go in after her .
she almost dragged you down by your hair .
oh ... imagine that .
at one time you had enough hair
that a woman could grab it with both her hands .
you &apos;re going to be fine , tony . i know it .
the doctors say you &apos;re going to be fine too .
they are very confident .
they know that you are really strong .
you &apos;re strong as a bull .
you know that that &apos;s always gotten to me .
when you used to pick me up and throw me over your shoulder--
oh , my god , tony .
you used to get me so hot down there .
i can feel it right now just thinking about it .
you are going to be okay , tony .
your friends ,
your kids all love you .
a long time ago i told you you were going to go to hell when you died ,
when you had that mri .
and you threw my words back at me when we got separated .
and you were right . that was a horrible thing to say .
it &apos;s a sin ,
and i will be judged for it .
you &apos;re a good father .
you care about your friends .
yes , it &apos;s been rough between us .
i don &apos;t know , our hearts get so hardened
against each other . i don &apos;t know why .
but you are not going to hell .
you &apos;re coming back here .
i love you .
mr. finnerty ,
sorry it took so long ,
but i saw some things on the ct scan i didn &apos;t like ,
which is why i ordered the mri .
how long have i been here ?
in looking at your mri ,
see these dark areas ?
these are parts of your brain that have been oxygen deprived .
uh @-@ huh .
unfortunately , these are consistent
with a diagnosis of alzheimer &apos;s . - what ?
you &apos;re going to want to see a neurologist when you get home ,
but the radiologist here has seen the studies and he concurs .
alzheimer &apos;s ? i &apos;m 46 years old .
what the hell ?
this goddamn miserable trip .
the good news is the treatment picture
isn &apos;t quite as bleak as it would have been a while back .
it &apos;s a death sentence .
you &apos;re a smurf for 10 or 15 years and then you die
shitting in your pajamas .
i know people with alzheimer &apos;s .
mr. finnerty , talk to your own docs back home .
my name &apos;s not even finnerty .
i lost my wallet and my briefcase , and i picked his up .
so you guys took out his insurance card from his wallet .
how &apos;s that float your boat ?
well , what is your name ?
what does it matter ? i &apos;m not going to know myself soon .
you can rest here a while .
you &apos;re fine other than the minor concussion .
fall like that could have broken your neck .
i &apos;m lost .
aj wanted to come but he got
a really bad stomach flu from a burrito .
law firm &apos;s being so understanding about me taking time off
from my internship to be here .
finn &apos;s coming out .
he really likes you .
i was reading this morning and i found this .
i want to share it with you .
by jacques prevert--
&quot; our father which art
in heaven , stay there ,
and we shall stay on earth ,
which is sometimes so pretty . &quot;
look , i took some pepto @-@ bismol .
how much do you know about the prius ?
i could &apos;ve been naked in here .
you need to familiarize yourself with hybrid cars , meadow .
it &apos;s important . this is the conversation of the future .
why are you breaking my balls about hybrid cars ?
i don &apos;t give a shit . i &apos;ve been up all night .
oh , you &apos;re tired ? poor you .
you never give two fucks about the environment .
ls that what &apos;s crawling up your butt ?
that i was at the hospital last night when you told mom you &apos;d come ?
i didn &apos;t say one word to you about it and neither did anyone else .
we &apos;re all so glad you fucking kicked your stomach flu , okay ?
i saw how you looked at my plate of food .
i can &apos;t eat at my own house ?
i wasn &apos;t looking at your plate . it &apos;s all in your mind .
don &apos;t you find this completely embarrassing ?
what ?
this , our family .
our father gets shot by our goober fucking uncle ?
what is that ?
yeah , it &apos;s embarrassing .
i don &apos;t want to think about what finn &apos;s parents are saying .
i mean , i don &apos;t really give a shit about my friends .
they know what dad does , but like , some of them remember uncle junior .
he was always a fucking mummy .
why did dad hang out with him ?
you know dad .
he takes those things seriously , all the italian family stuff .
yeah , i got the big lecture . now look .
i know .
look at these fucking reporters .
hey ! fuck you !
i &apos;ll be glad to sit with tony .
hospital rules , it &apos;s family only for now , but thank you .
angie phoned .
guess she &apos;s very busy over there with her body shop .
huh @-@ uh .
oh , look who &apos;s here . hey fabio , i &apos;m available .
so what ? now there &apos;s an actual roster
of who stays with dad and when , and i &apos;m not on it ?
frankly , aj , i didn &apos;t think you &apos;d be interested .
i was sick and i &apos;ve been trying to study ,
which is what everybody &apos;s usually hassling me about 24 / 7 .
i guess there always has to be something , right ?
come here and sit down , okay ?
&quot; studying . &quot; he goes clubbing in new york .
well you cut him too much slack . you still protect him .
i know he avoids tony because he can &apos;t face seeing him like this .
it frightens him . - it frightens everybody .
he should get a pass ? you know kids his age are getting blown up in iraq .
you know something that &apos;s interesting ? janice noticed
that when aj talks about tony &apos;s possibly
not coming out of this , he can &apos;t even use the word &quot; dad . &quot;
he says &quot; anthony soprano is not going to die . &quot;
well , that &apos;s a fascinating psychological nugget ,
but it don &apos;t change the fact
that if that kid don &apos;t pull his end in this ,
he &apos;s never going to forgive himself and nobody else should either .
it &apos;s just that tony has always loomed so large for aj .
well maybe it &apos;s just that aj is a selfish boy who doesn &apos;t give a shit .
i &apos;m sorry your son is no longer with us
but don &apos;t use mine as a guinea pig for your ideas on parenting .
i never saw you take a hard line .
why do you think i &apos;m talking to you like this ?
the thing is , tony has an open incision .
if you are there in the room and they change the dressing ,
it &apos;s very hard to take .
and i don &apos;t know that aj should see that .
hey ! get the fuck off the property !
hey ! i warned you yesterday . the curb line is your limit .
i know . i know you hate it .
i &apos;m not going to tell you what to do , finn .
how would you describe your husband &apos;s relationship with his uncle ?
were they close ?
you know of any issue they might have been having ?
i don &apos;t speak with junior . i haven &apos;t for years .
my husband knows how i feel and he never brought him up .
what was your conflict about ?
it &apos;s not something i &apos;m going to discuss with you .
your husband ever talk about junior soprano &apos;s mental state ?
you &apos;re flying full @-@ fare coach ?
i did hear him telling other people
how junior was getting more and more confused--
calling my husband johnny , which was his father &apos;s name ;
resisting getting a haircut , that kind of thing .
you spoke with your husband what time of the night of the incident ?
i-- i don &apos;t know . - i &apos;m not bailing .
meadow , could you ?
i &apos;m just trying to understand . - understand what ?
you &apos;re coming out from california to support me with my father being shot
or because dental school is just sucking for you .
both. ls that so awful ?
if you have any more questions you &apos;re going to have to call my lawyer .
when he was taken into custody ,
junior made pointed references
to the mcguire sisters , sam giancana .
you mean the kennedy assassination ?
yeah .
you mean as related to this ?
my husband was three years old .
oh , i could sleep right here . it &apos;s all right . he &apos;ll be okay .
the shelby gt 500 ? 450 horsepower .
oh baby , and this guy on campus has one ?
and the mustang &apos;s not as expensive as the m3
i used to talk about getting all the time .
jennifer , another round when you get your chance .
chris !
oh , ahmed .
you guys here again ? you ought to put up a tent on this fucking bar .
how &apos;s tony ? the girl said he was hurt pretty bad ?
he &apos;s keeping his dick up .
his uncle did this to him ?
i was saying to muhammad , why the hell--
not something we talk about .
please , give tony our best when you talk to him .
i will .
