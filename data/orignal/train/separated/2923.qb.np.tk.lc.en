i &apos;d like to meet him . he sounds like a standup guy .
he &apos;s protective of me , so you &apos;d better watch yourself .
your roommate , is he good @-@ looking ?
must be tough to keep your hands off him .
i &apos;m pretty sure he &apos;s gay .
no ! no , he &apos;s not ! why are you trying to ruin the game ?
which brings us back to greely &apos;s theory of dominance .
that &apos;s it for today .
does anyone know where the freeman building is ?
it &apos;s the new building on avenue a.
that &apos;s across town . i &apos;m teaching there in 10 minutes .

i &apos;m sorry , i couldn &apos;t even get through that .
i knew it . tell me your moves .
all right .
well ..
i start by having a bottle of wine sent to my table from a fan .
oh , my god . and that works ?
if you add , &quot; this is embarrassing . i just want to have a normal life . &quot;
you poor little famous man .
okay , how about this one ?
i was gonna wait until the end of the night to kiss you ..
but you &apos;re just so beautiful , i don &apos;t think i can .
oh , my god !
wow , that was fantastic ! i almost leaned in . really .
so tell me one of your moves .
all right .
so where &apos;d you grow up ?
that &apos;s your move ?
boy , rach , you &apos;re lucky you &apos;re hot .
come on , just answer the question .
queens .
were you close to your parents ?
with my mom . not so much my dad .
why not ?
i don &apos;t know . there &apos;s just this distance .
we both try to pretend it &apos;s not there , but it is .
it &apos;s gotta be rough .
yeah , it &apos;s really tough . sometimes i think ..
wow !
nice move !
&quot; where &apos;d you grow up ? &quot; so simple .
thank you .
now , excuse me . i &apos;m gonna use the restroom .
now you &apos;re watching me walk away .
yes , i am ! so simple !
you won &apos;t believe what i did today .
clearly not shower or shave .
i played this all day , and now i rule .
they should change the name to &quot; ms. chandler . &quot;
although , i hope they don &apos;t .
you stayed home and played ms. pac @-@ man while i went to work like a chump ?
i got the top 1.0 scores . i erased phoebe off the board . high @-@ five !
what is the matter with your hand ?
i played for eight hours .
it &apos;ll loosen up . check out the scores .
also , look at the initials . they &apos;re dirty words .
chandler , why would you do that ?
because it &apos;s awesome .
you think it &apos;s clever ?
they only give you three letters , so after a @-@ s @-@ s , it is a challenge .
but clearly you &apos;re up to the task .
this one &apos;s not dirty .
put it together with that one .
oh .
if you don &apos;t clear this off , you won &apos;t get one of those from me .
ben &apos;s coming over tomorrow . this can &apos;t be there .
he won &apos;t know what they mean .
he &apos;s 7 , not stupid .
have you talked to him lately ?
i &apos;m gonna unplug it .
i &apos;ll have nothing to show for my day . like work .
no !
hey , look ! it &apos;s still there !
this thing must have some kind of primitive rom chip !
wow . the dirty words and the computer talk .
this is just the coolest you &apos;ve ever been .
you gotta beat your scores .
with the claw ?
fine , i &apos;ll do it . we gotta get this off .
carol &apos;s still upset that you taught him &quot; pull my finger . &quot;
pull my finger . my hand is messed up !
i am not gonna answer that .
oh , come on . just pick one .
between monica , phoebe , chandler and ross ..
if you had to , who would you punch ?
we &apos;re friends . i wouldn &apos;t punch any of them .
chandler ?
yeah , but i don &apos;t know why .
i &apos;m having a wonderful time !
me too !
this is the best date i ever had .
i know !
i laughed so hard . did you see the wine come out my nose ?
joey , i think everybody saw it .
i never knew i could enjoy the non @-@ sex part of a date so much .
that &apos;s because you have never been on a date with me before .
all right . now don &apos;t judge me .
i normally wait till my date leaves , but i &apos;m ripping into the swan .
okay , then you don &apos;t judge me .
i &apos;m gonna suck on the cellophane from that brownie .
oh , yeah .
so tell me , what are joey tribbiani &apos;s end @-@ of @-@ the @-@ night moves ?
well , if i want the girl to kiss me ..
first , i make my lips look irresistible .
how do you do it ?
now you can &apos;t tell anyone , but ..
i put on shiny lip balm .
oh , my god .
like a moth to a flame , i tell you .
okay , now you go .
no , i don &apos;t want to tell you .
why not ?
it &apos;s embarrassing .
more embarrassing than shiny raspberry lip balm ?
i didn &apos;t say raspberry before , did i ?
just tell me , rach . just tell me .
okay .
all right , stand up .
well , when we &apos;re at the door ..
i lightly press my lips against his .
then move into his body , just for a second .
and then i make this sound :
it doesn &apos;t sound like anything , but it works .
oh , yeah . that would work , yeah .
all right , i gotta go to bed . i had such a wonderful time .
me too .
you were 50 minutes late ? did you crawl ?
no , i ran , okay ? it &apos;s really far .
when did people stop understanding &quot; get out of my way &quot; ?
why didn &apos;t you take a cab ?
with the traffic and one @-@ way streets , it &apos;d take me twice as long .
and i have class three times a week . who am i , rockefeller ?
you won &apos;t be able to keep doing this .
if i don &apos;t , they &apos;ll take the class away from me .
and i put it in my family newsletter .
your what ?
you &apos;ve seen it , the geller yeller .
right . wow .
i figured out a faster route . i &apos;m sure i can make it this time .
i just can &apos;t be afraid to get a little bit hit by cars .
hey .
hi !
remember when we talked about cujo ?
i can &apos;t believe you haven &apos;t seen cujo .
relax , it isn &apos;t citizen kane .
have you ever sat through citizen kane ?
yeah , it &apos;s really boring . but it &apos;s , like , a big deal .
anyway , i was thinking about renting cujo .
well , let &apos;s do it tonight .

oh , right .
hey , joey , can i ask you something ?
yeah .
after our date , did you feel weird ?
oh , my god . you did too ? it freaked me out . what was that ?

oh , yeah . yeah , the lobster .
i was up sick all night .
me too . all night .
really ? we didn &apos;t cross paths .
yeah , well , that &apos;s because ..
i stayed in my room .

okay , i got that .
i &apos;ll escape there . i &apos;ll come back here .
all right . come on , ms. pac @-@ man .
well , you &apos;re just a little bitch , aren &apos;t you ? !
hey , you guys ?
i &apos;m sorry that i was hogging the game before .
but if you don &apos;t get off soon , i will cut you .
oh , my god ! your friends have some unfortunate initials .
they &apos;re all chandler .
chandler couldn &apos;t get this good .
i did . but it came at a price .
ben &apos;s coming , and he can &apos;t see this .
by age 7 , kids have already seen orgies .
was it just me ?
so ..
we &apos;re about out of time .
now , i know i &apos;ve given you a lot of new information .
and it may seem a little overwhelming .

and suddenly seen them in a different way ?
