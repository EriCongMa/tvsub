eradicate .
take that , blorgons .
good show , inspector .
oh , wow , there are 50 years of these , huh ?
yeah , isn &apos;t it great ?
we can go anywhere and any time in the universe .
but it will probably be london during the blitz .
oh , i think i finally got abed to agree to
let you come to the inspector spacetime convention .
yay .
are you watching inspector spacetime ?
why does he have to wake up so early ?
can &apos;t we just tell abed
that we &apos;re sleeping together ?
no . no . abed &apos;s fragile .
we have to ease him into it , okay ?
do we want him to freak out
and then we have to rescue him from some fantasy world
where submarines are small enough to enter the bloodstream ?
i totally want to do that .
we need to go over the convention schedule again .
go , go , go , go , go .
just a minute .
troy , it &apos;s a week away ,
and we need to revise our whole strategy .
troy .
i &apos;ve printed out several maps of the convention center
and color @-@ coded the best potential routes .
now we know i have a longer stride ,
but i &apos;m assuming your superior physical fitness
will allow you to compensate with greater speed .
one thing &apos;s for sure , though . we need to save time
by changing into our costumes in the car .
curling iron .
thanks .
coming .
hi , abed .
just here for my breakfast date with troy .
oh , good morning , britta .
i haven &apos;t seen you in over 12 hours .
yeah .
i know you two are having sex .
i &apos;ve known for weeks .
what ?
why didn &apos;t you say something ?
i love doughnuts .
第四季 第三集
i just need to get my sunglasses , and then we can go .
we &apos;re gonna be late , and you don &apos;t need sunglasses
to go to an inspector spacetime convention .
you &apos;re right . for an inspector spacetime convention ,
i would need a bag to put over my head .
but annie and i are going skiing .
that is the only reason i agreed to this road trip .
what are you doing here ?
i always come early to save my seat .
and what &apos;s this about a road trip ?
look , pierce ,
no one was trying to leave you out .
we just assumed you wouldn &apos;t be interested .
which is why we left you out .
that &apos;s not fair .
why can &apos;t i go to a captain warptime convention ?
because you &apos;ll ruin it .
i &apos;m getting sick of everyone assuming
that i have nothing to offer .
you know , in ancient greece , it was considered an honor
to invite a person my age
to a space convention ?
we didn &apos;t invite shirley either .
well , that &apos;s better then .
all right . good night .
good night .
i can &apos;t believe it-- our first inspecticon .
it &apos;s beautiful .
now are you sure it &apos;s okay britta &apos;s here ?
because she can just wait in the car .
it &apos;s cool .
now the first thing we need to do
is find the booth where they take the gluon photo .
it &apos;s a photo where two people are fused together
like the inspector and reggie were bonded
for eternity in episode 704 .
wait , was there a female inspector ?
yes . and everyone hates her .
not because they &apos;re sexist .
because she sucks .
well , i think it &apos;s cool .
britta .
annie .
you &apos;re on your own , al capone .
everyone &apos;s entitled to their own opinion .
am i the only one freaked out by that ?
no , i think abed was just showing
that he &apos;s accepting of our relationship .
no , really . what was it ?
hey , annie , sad news .
they closed the ski slopes .
a dozen scouts got buried in an avalanche . so sad .
i say we cut our losses and head home .
what ? why ? we &apos;re already here .
we can still have fun hanging out at the convention .
i &apos;d have more fun hanging out with
the parents that are circling the block .
jeff , why are people staring at you ?
because they &apos;ve never seen a man who &apos;s had sex before ?
all right , how many of those do you have in your chamber ?
enough for the whole ride home .
jeff .
what ?
we wanted it to be a surprise .
you bear a striking resemblance to inspector spacetime &apos;s
supervillain thoraxis .
okay . now we &apos;re definitely leaving .
but i &apos;ve never been on an adult vacation before .
this is the first time i &apos;ve stayed in a hotel
without a number in its name .
hey , you can stay if you want .
fine . i &apos;ll be in my room .
good . the reservation &apos;s under my name .
enjoy the nerds .
i will enjoy the ...
jeff won .
i know .
abed , the gluon photo line looks really long .
we should probably get in it now .
definitely . right after i find toby .
who &apos;s toby ?
toby weeks . arguably the biggest
inspector spacetime fan in the world .
we &apos;ve been emailing for months .
you never mentioned him .
well , you &apos;ve been so busy lately having sex .
besides , we talked about embracing change ,
so i &apos;m expanding my social circle .
i just hope he makes it .
he works in nigeria in banking .
he almost couldn &apos;t come because all his money
was tied up in this financial thing ,
but i sent him 700 pounds
and a plane ticket , so he should be here .
oh , abed .
there he is .
you must be abed .
inspector . ooh , before i forget ,
here is your check .
thanking you very much indeed .
nice .
you wouldn &apos;t believe how many people i emailed asking for help ,
and they completely ignored me .
toby , this is britta .
fraulein .
and my best friend troy .
and where &apos;s your constable ?
oh , my best friend andrew .
he was supposed to come , but then his wife
wouldn &apos;t let him go at the last minute .
she &apos;s such a ...
minerva .
yeah , yeah , oh , minerva .
what a bitch .
wait , was that the female inspector ?
not in front of toby .
hey , gluon line , we should probably get in it right now .
alternatively , someone might just happen
to have a pair of tickets to the sold @-@ out panel ,
&quot; which inspector would win in a fight in space ,
and which inspector would win in a fight in time ? &quot;
we can get that photo later .
yeah , later .
that was when i wanted to take it .
are you sure troy and abed want us here ?
they do . they just don &apos;t know it yet .
now , remember , we &apos;re just a couple of captain warphead fans .
nobody will even notice we &apos;re here .
excuse me .
oh , yes ?
will you come with us ?
where ? why ? when ?
room service .
yes , i &apos;d like to order some food .
and how many people will be dining today , mrs. winger ?
oh , i &apos;m not ...
two . yeah , i &apos;d like a turkey burger
and a second turkey burger , but with no bun .
my husband doesn &apos;t do carbs .
but he would like a scotch .
and what kind of scotch would your husband prefer ?
the good kind .
i &apos;ll see what we can do .
yes , mrs. winger ?
excuse me , i don &apos;t mean to bother you ,
but are you nigel cuthbertson ,
the actor who played thoraxis ?
call me nige .
we have every right to be here , and i don &apos;t know
if you &apos;re being sexist , ageist , racist ,
or what , but i don &apos;t think i like your @-@ ist .
actually , we need your help .
we &apos;re focus @-@ testing a new american version
of inspector spacetime ,
and you two represent several significant quadrants .
oh , i don &apos;t know .
your thoughts would be very valuable to us .
we &apos;re in .
toby , did you see ...
the christmas special ?
horrible .
but when you consider what it set up ...
brilliant .
is that ... ?
let &apos;s go .
what about the photo ?
do they even have to talk ?
they could just touch tentacles and download .
you know , this is good , because , you know ,
abed &apos;s branching out ,
and toby &apos;s really , really great .
no . troy , i have seen that look .
girls have given me that look .
you are not being crazy .
that dude is trying to steal your boyfriend .
i &apos;m gonna get a refill .
i mean , what if abed wants a replacement ?
he makes me so angry and so sad ,
all at the same time .
i know , but you have to hide it ,
because , for some reason ,
men find these feelings to be psycho ,
and , if you freak out , it &apos;s only gonna push abed away .
like i always say , if you love someone ,
set them free , and , if they don &apos;t come back to you ,
they were never yours to begin with .
that makes no sense .
what if they get hit by a car or fall down a well ?
remind me not to put you down as my emergency contact .
all right . play it cool .
make nice with toby .
yeah .
so ?
what did everyone think ?
i thought it was pretty good .
i was confused .
and what confused you ?
the time travel mostly .
also the space travel .
anything else ?
how many clipboards you got ?
raise the klaxon .
me lorry &apos;s plunging it into the thames , me thinks .
hey , do you mind if i practice my american accent ?
i have an audition .
of course .
you really are an inspector spacetime fan .
ever since i was little .
what is it you like about the show ?
i think the show &apos;s philosophy poses some really interesting ...
questions about the nature ...
i &apos;m so sorry .
bow before thoraxis .
this is my ringtone .
bow before thoraxis .
okay , seriously , what was it ?
you wear glasses ? you have a back brace ?
say it . i don &apos;t care .
and i asked myself
what does space smell like ?
you see , the thing of it-- -
oh , hey , there you guys are .
oh , this is so nice , just three friends ,
friending around all unthreatened @-@ like .
terribly sorry . this is slightly embarrassing .
i seem to have forgotten your name .
it &apos;s troy !
you know it &apos;s troy !
okay , it &apos;s the first part of troy and abed .
toby and abed in the morning ?
that &apos;s ridiculous .
i &apos;m not psycho !
okay .
where was i ? oh , yes ...
troy &apos;s been acting weird lately .
the same thing happened with my constable when he got a wife .
which means of course i now have one spare ticket
to the 50th anniversary inspector spacetime
convention in london .
demiceninspecticon ?
but it &apos;s so soon , and london &apos;s too far .
in england , cadbury creme eggs are sold year @-@ round .
i thought that was just a legend .
just a minute .
just a second .
i &apos;ve got your hair dryer , mrs. winger .
oh , thank you , randy , but it &apos;s not for me .
it &apos;s for my husband .
he really needs the diffuser for his hair .
it sounds shallow , but he &apos;s a lawyer .
actually , having dual careers has put
a lot of stress on our marriage .
hence the separate rooms .
but i think this trip is really gonna change all that .
my husband will finally see me
not as a world @-@ famous police detective ,
but as a woman .
your husband &apos;s a lucky man .
that he is .
tastes of bog .
you see ? it &apos;s funny because it &apos;s clear .
actually i would like to say something .
i am friends with a couple of huge inspector spacetime fans ,
and i think what they like about the show
is that it &apos;s smart , complicated ,
and doesn &apos;t talk down to its audience .
so , if you &apos;d like to make a really good american version ,
you should stay true to that .
hey , instead of this constable ,
what about a blonde with long legs
and a tennis racket ?
yes .
please ! for me .
bow before ...
normally we don &apos;t concern ourselves with adultery ,
&apos;cause then hotels wouldn &apos;t exist .
but everyone here thinks you &apos;re so nice ,
so i have to bring you down here .
i don &apos;t believe it .
he told me he was leaving .
say your catch phrase .
i ...
rather not .
what the hell is going on here ?
suddenly our marriage isn &apos;t worth repairing ?
what ?
wait !
nigel is married ?
that is so thoraxis !
and your american accent isn &apos;t at all convincing .
we come all this way ,
and you just leave me alone without
so much as sending a text message
i &apos;m sick with it , jeff nigel winger
can i get two more of these , please ?
enough !
this day has turned crazy .
i &apos;m gonna go upstairs , towel off ,
and pray to god that i wake up in the middle of
a final for a class i didn &apos;t know i was enrolled in .
shoo .
oh , honey .
you went all psycho girlfriend on abed , didn &apos;t you ?
yeah . i screwed up .
classic troy .
it &apos;s okay . it happens to the best of us .
i got you a present .
a quantum spanner .
yeah , it lights up or
plays music or something .
britta ,
would you agree to be bonded to me forever
in the gluon chamber for an expensive souvenir photograph ?
absolutely .
thank you .
what ?
i can &apos;t wait . we can visit the original spacetime set .
and i &apos;ve got a spare bedroom ,
so you can stay as long as you like .
that all sounds great .
but i don &apos;t know if i could just pick up and leave .
i have a life here .
for now .
what do you mean ?
well , let &apos;s face it .
neurotypicals don &apos;t have the same focus you or i have .
they always get distracted ...
by marriage , kids , competitive cooking shows .
like your best friend david .
that &apos;s right .
who was planning on coming here
even though you were trapped in nigeria ?
yeah , but i wouldn &apos;t say trapped .
and you went to me and not to your best friend
and constable for help ?
well , his wife probably deleted the email .
she &apos;s a total ...
minerva . right .
and you &apos;re dressed as the third inspector ,
who was famous for trying to strangle the actor
who played constable dudley , because they were
both pursuing linda mccartney .
david doesn &apos;t actually exist , does he ?
you &apos;re mad .
nothing you &apos;ve said can prove that .
except that when we met you said
his name was andrew .
bollocks .
yeah .
all right . guilty as charged .
look , i had to be sure , didn &apos;t i ?
when you sent me that first email
in which you figured out that inspector spacetime
is both his own grandfather and grandmother ,
i knew we were soul mates .
you and i are special .
neurotypicals won &apos;t admit it ,
but some people are just better than everybody else .
they can &apos;t handle it , so they always leave .
just like how the brilliant inspector has constant adventures ,
while his constables always eventually return
to their dull , ordinary earth lives .
but maybe there &apos;s a reason the inspector
always chooses a human companion .
he &apos;s an alien , but his human friends keep him
grounded and invested in the world ,
like with me and troy .
if i could winger you for a second .
sure . i don &apos;t know what that means , but ...
maybe all relationships are made up of
logical inspectors and emotional constables , and we need both
to make space and time a better place .
maybe you &apos;re right .
wait , wait . toby , toby , toby , no .
wait just a second .
just playing a game .
you have to let me out !
no , not until stockholm syndrome sets in .
how long do you think that &apos;ll be , a couple of hours ?
would you love me if i got you a churro ?
annie .
annie , i ...
i &apos;m not sure how much air there is in here !
and still you talk .
troy will find me .
who ?
you know who troy is .
yeah . troy will find me .
everything okay ?
everything &apos;s fine .
what is a gluon anyway ?
can we stop talking about abed ?
i &apos;m sorry . i can &apos;t .
it doesn &apos;t feel right .
it &apos;s okay . i understand .
go to him .
are you sure ?
i &apos;ve told you before .
i don &apos;t care about inspector spacetime .
toby .
where &apos;s abed ?
he &apos;s packing .
he said you have a girlfriend and don &apos;t need him anymore .
he &apos;s coming with me to england .
you &apos;re lying .
how would you know ?
because abed &apos;s my friend ,
and he would have told me .
and he would have explained it to me in very clear terms ,
because i get confused sometimes .
he &apos;s in there , isn &apos;t he ?
no .
hey , troy .
hey , abed .
toby , have you ever been in a fight ?
because i have .
oh , my god . he can make a fist .
that would hurt harder than a slap .
he &apos;s in that one .
i knew that .
you okay ?
i am .
you know , for the first time in my long history
of being locked inside things ,
i knew someone would come .
still want to take the gluon photo ?
what do you think ?
yes .
yes .
well , i just went upstairs and saw your room .
saw the two robes , the two coffee cups ,
one with lipstick , one without.and--
i saw actual hair that looked a lot like mine
on my side of the sink , so i have some questions .
oh , god .
first one ,
is that actually my hair , and , if so ,
did it fall out naturally ?
because if it did , you need to tell me right now ,
&apos;cause i have to call science .
also , what the hell is going on ?
all right , i may have been play @-@ acting
that we were married , and then
the staff hought you were cheating , and i had to save face .
do i have to worry about this ?
no , i was just daydreaming .
i mean , i &apos;ve married you at least a half a dozen times .
and troy . and zac efron .
mostly zac efron .
does zac get a drink thrown in his face ?
i don &apos;t know . i guess i was a little hurt
that you ditched me .
i mean , we are friends , right ?
would it have been that painful to hang out together ?
well , i can tell you one thing
your fantasy got wrong .
if we were married ,
you wouldn &apos;t find me flirting with
another woman in a hotel bar .
but there are a lot of things that you think are fun
that i wouldn &apos;t want to do because i &apos;m ...
older ?
not lame .
do you want to hang out now ?
can i buy you a drink ? what do you want ?
an appletini .
oh , god , don &apos;t make me order that .
please ?
please ?
appletini .
that is so great .
and i have a surprise for you guys .
really pushing me here .
he &apos;s back .
do you mind if we crash this party ?
that we already crashed .
pierce , shirley , i &apos;m glad you guys made it .
it was rude of me not to invite you .
i &apos;m sorry .
just remember , abed ,
i did my best .
we both did .
you &apos;re welcome .
so i guess we &apos;re taking off .
actually , i &apos;d like to stay for a little while .
yeah ?
yeah .
you don &apos;t have to do that for me .
well , who says it &apos;s just for you ?
guys , get your phones ready ,
because you are only gonna see this once .
bow before thoraxis .
see , this is why i don &apos;t hang with you folks on the weekends .
here we are , the 1960s ,
the greatest , grooviest period
in the entire history of the entire universe .
i &apos;m lucky . i get to visit places like this
because i can travel through time and space ,
but not both at once .
do you know why that is , ensign ?
because , inspector spacetime ,
our minds would be blown with the space / time confusion .
that &apos;s right .
and now i must sleep with the sexiest woman here ,
who is also my grandmother ,
or i will cease to exist .
how do you know i &apos;m not your grandmother ?
there &apos;s only one way to find out .
