the wheels on the bus
i can hear you staring at her .
i am not staring .
you think i should go with her ?
i don &apos;t know .
i mean look . what &apos;s the worst gonna happen ?
she says &quot; no &quot; ?
will be the first time you heard it .
and the blue lace trim will go perfect with my eyes .
your eyes are brown .
contacts . duh .
now all i need is the perfect date .
there &apos;s a car in the road .
what &apos;s going on ? did he run out of gas ?
that sucks .
should i call for help ?
uh , probably just a flat .
i need you all to remain in your seats .
everybody quiet down !
you all right ?
come on !
shh , be quiet !
kevin .
i need you .
hey , i got your text .
i &apos;ve been meaning to call you back about dinner the other night .
look , i had a really great time .
oh , uh , what are you talking--
no . have you seen the news ?
no . why ? what &apos;s going on ?
we need all hands on deck .
what we have is a school bus abduction
which occurred at approximately 1 pm this afternoon .
what we do know is there were 24 students on board ,
along with the driver and a monitor .
gps appears to have been disabled .
last known ping was a little over two hours ago .
highway patrol has traced the route it was last traveling
but found no signs of any accidents .
we have helicopters and ground units in the dc area
working local search and rescue .
which means we &apos;re likely dealing with more than one unsub .
we &apos;ve attempted to contact everyone on board ,
but so far all calls have gone unanswered .
but we can confirm that the students dropped off
at the first two stops have been accounted for .
the average school bus
holds approximately 80 gallons of diesel fuel ,
making it possible for them
to travel up to 550 miles on a single tank .
which is why we believe
they &apos;re still within a 200 @-@ mile radius .
it could be a kidnapping ,
but we can &apos;t rule out anything from a terrorist act
to a child trafficking ring .
how does a busful of kids just vanish into thin air ?
it doesn &apos;t . whoever &apos;s got them &apos;s got a two @-@ hour head start .
we &apos;re treating this as a mass abduction .
the suvs are outside and
we &apos;ll set up our command post at central high .
french novelist giraudoux said ,
&quot; i &apos;m not a afraid death .
it &apos;s the stake one puts up in order to play the game of life . &quot;
ok , thanks . local pd says they just found
a backpack full of the kids &apos; cell phones
half a mile from the second bus stop .
disarming the gps , disposing of cell phones
feels less random and more premeditated .
there were 7 other buses from different schools on their route .
why target this particular bus ?
maybe a group of kids got together to pull it off ?
waited for their friends to
get off at an earlier stop , then made their move .
ok , i &apos;m checking school disciplinary records
seeing if i can find any recent suspensions .
it could be about a specific target
and the other kids just got in the way .
alex , you &apos;re on speaker .
uh , i &apos;ve been looking over the personnel files
of the bus driver , roy webster .
something isn &apos;t adding up .
what did you find ?
over the past 3 years ,
webster had several altercations with students
but was never formally reprimanded .
it sounds like the school hasn &apos;t told us the whole story .
we know how disrespectful
some teenagers can be . maybe he snapped .
it could be payback for years of abuse .
what about the woman who was on the bus ?
that would be carol roberts , retired teacher ,
assigned to monitor webster &apos;s bus 6 months ago .
what &apos;s that about ?
i took a bus all through high school .
we never had a monitor .
makes you wonder who she was there
to keep an eye on-- the kids or webster ?
please , it &apos;s too tight .
just let us go . we won &apos;t tell anyone .
hey , hey , wait , wait .
wait !
弗吉尼亚州 弗雷德里克斯堡
addyson transferred to central high last year .
did she mention any enemies ?
so sean &apos;s been riding the bus since he was a freshman ?
did he have any run @-@ ins with mr. webster ?
i know this is difficult for both of you .
i just have a couple of questions .
billy &apos;s a sophomore , right ?
can you tell me a little bit about him ?
he &apos;s a good kid .
he stays out of trouble for the most part .
been just the two of us for a while .
his dad passed when he was 10 .
please , find my baby .
he &apos;s all i &apos;ve got .
i compiled background info on every kid on that bus .
their cell phone records , their texts , twitter feeds ,
facebook activity , everything .
great . can you help me go through these sim cards ?
thanks , by the way .
of course .
uh , that &apos;s , uh , sean parker .
he never posts a status update
without being witty or sarcastic .
that &apos;s trent walker ,
your classic high school jock .
oh , my god .
that &apos;s addyson jones .
look at the time .
that was taken while they were still on the bus .
that &apos;s right before they went missing .
in the chowchilla case , the unsub used car trouble
as a ruse to get the bus driver &apos;s attention .
yeah , i remember .
the driver became a hero overnight .
the most isolated part of the highway .
it &apos;s surrounded by nothing .
no witnesses . nobody to interrupt .
making them the perfect target .
mr. webster has worked with the school for 15 years .
according to his file , he was never reprimanded
for the altercations he had with the students . why is that ?
he agreed to complete mandated classes .
in exchange , the incidents wouldn &apos;t go on his record .
were the parents made aware of the school &apos;s disciplinary actions ?
look , being a bus driver can be stressful .
you &apos;re responsible for getting these kids to and from school .
add a few unruly teens and someone &apos;s bound to bump heads .
is that why carol roberts was assigned to monitor the bus ?
agent hotchner .
we found a body .
it &apos;s roy webster .
he suffered two bullet wounds .
the first was a clean shot to his left leg .
the second in his chest .
why not go for the kill first ?
they probably still needed him to drive .
if they dumped webster this quickly ,
i &apos;m sure carol roberts isn &apos;t far behind .
there &apos;s no way somebody pulled this off alone .
one unsub probably controlled the adults
and one controlled the kids .
well , why get rid of them before they reached their destination ?
you &apos;re on speaker , garcia .
hey , i reran the last gps signal of the bus
through a proxy server , retracing the route ,
and it turns out that the signal was never disabled ,
it was just masked .
so i sent the coordinates to your phones .
this is less than a mile away .
bus is all clear !
morgan .
all clear .
northeast corner clear .
south corner clear .
barn was registered to a violet burgin .
she died a few months back .
it &apos;s been abandoned every since .
making this a perfect transfer point .
they found something .
please don &apos;t hurt us .
it &apos;s ok . you guys are safe now .
there &apos;s only 14 here . we need to find the other 10 .
move !
are you ok ?
he &apos;s mine .
why only take some of the kids ?
smaller numbers . easier to control .
if this was a child trafficking ring ,
they wouldn &apos;t have left any of them behind
regardless of the risk .
whatever the reason , they only needed 10 .
what do you want with us ? !
i don &apos;t hear anything .
do you ?
no .
mine is dead , too .
what is this thing ?
where are we ?
what happened to mrs. roberts ?
they probably killed her like they did mr. webster .
they &apos;re gonna kill us , too .
sean .
cut it out .
why do you think they took their masks off ?
welcome to hell , people .
did you hear that ?
number 2 and number 5 step forward .
wait , am i number 2 ?
who &apos;s number 5 ?
it &apos;s you , man .
addy ...
let &apos;s go .
it &apos;s time .
the rules are simple .
you follow our instructions , you live .
you don &apos;t ...
that &apos;s enough . they got the message .
you ready ?
may the best man win .
you ok , addyson ?
i &apos;m fine .
you all right ?
yeah .
what was that ?
players , the game will commence
in 3 ...
2 ...
1 .
well , whenever i &apos;m trying to remember important details ,
i find it really helps if i close my eyes and try to relax .
yeah , that &apos;s great .
you guys were on your way home from school .
can you tell me what happened next ?
the bus had stopped .
think he ran out of gas ?
that sucks .
are you all right ? is everything ...
he shot mr. webster
in the ...
ok . all right . all right .
slow down .
all right . let &apos;s go back .
let &apos;s go back .
did you get a look at the man who shot mr. webster ?
no .
he wore a mask .
what type of mask ?
like a gas mask .
what happened next ?
they both had guns .
one walked up and down the aisle
while the other one just stood there .
so there were two of them ?
ok .
then what happened when you arrived at the barn ?
they lined us up .
our hands were tied .
i was so scared .
i wanted to run , but they had guns .
they put collars around our necks .
that &apos;s when they started taking turns .
taking turns doing what ?
picking .
where &apos;s billy ?
they said you found the bus .
there &apos;s still a number of students unaccounted for .
but we &apos;re still looking .
oh , my god .
stop it !
i can &apos;t open it .
these things aren &apos;t budging , billy .
no matter what , we stick together , ok ?
ok ?
ok .
how about we get the adrenaline going , huh ?
it &apos;s all about endurance .
training is as important as the battle itself .
there &apos;s a table at the end of the hallway with a box on it .
open it .
what &apos;s in it ?
it &apos;s a flashlight .
what &apos;s this for ?
look to your left .
dividing them into groups ...
you think that was to maintain control ?
mm , could be , but how do you explain the shock collars ?
torture .
still , there doesn &apos;t seem to be any method
to how or why they were chosen .
ok , so far we have two white males , early 20s ,
and wore gas masks , of all things .
abducting a bus ,
a form of transportation ,
gas masks , shock collars .
dividing people into teams .
this sounds a lot like &quot; gods of combat . &quot;
this is a video game .
it &apos;s ok .
it &apos;s just a little steam .
almost there .
now what ?
i &apos;m gonna get you out of here safely .
to do that , i &apos;m gonna need you to follow my orders .
it &apos;s important that you listen to each command .
take the one on the right .
he &apos;s telling me to take a right .
addyson , i know what you &apos;re thinking .
don &apos;t follow him .
it &apos;s not worth it .
take the path to the left .
why ?
just trust me .
i &apos;m not leaving you behind .
you see what you made me do ?
trent , just go . just do what they say .
don &apos;t make me do it again .
these guys are replicating a video game ?
in the game , you take over a form of public transportation .
subway , train , bus .
that &apos;s how you get your players .
wait a minute .
you &apos;ve played this game before ?
well , i may have played it once or twice .
as i remember , the game consists of 5 players .
captain , lieutenant , a pair of soldiers ,
and the pawn .
maybe the unsubs picked them based on their personality type .
well , sage and trent are both athletic .
so they probably would have been considered lieutenants .
wendy would most likely have been considered the pawn .
they preselected these kids .
probably got details about their lives from social media sites .
most teens don &apos;t use privacy settings .
anyone can gain access .
they planned their attacks
and struck the bus when it was most vulnerable .
that explains why the unsubs only needed 10 of these kids
and left the rest behind .
so how do the collars fit into all this ?
they &apos;re used to keep your player
from straying from their mission .
the object of the game is to destroy
as many of your opponents as possible .
the one with the highest body count wins .
it &apos;s just a rat .
don &apos;t worry , you &apos;ll get used to those .
what ? it &apos;s only blood .
you haven &apos;t even gotten to the best part .
oh , my god !
my captain &apos;s asking for an update .
he wants to release a statement .
we &apos;re just concerned if we release certain details
that we &apos;ll have copycats .
can you at least give me something ?
what kind of people are we dealing with ?
well , based on the unsubs &apos; behavior at this point ,
we believe they suffer from an extreme gaming addiction .
they &apos;re avid gamers ,
involved in the multi @-@ user online first @-@ person shooter game ,
&quot; gods of combat . &quot;
and like any addiction ,
this took over their lives and became an obsession .
we think that this video game
aggravated a pre @-@ existing affinity for violence .
then something blurred the lines
between fantasy violence and real violence .
they &apos;ve managed to depersonalize these kids
as a way of rationalizing the body count .
and playing this game taught them to be methodical
and dangerously strategic .
the fact that they &apos;re mimicking
specific and unique elements of this particular game
will help us predict their behavior .
they probably met online .
we think these unsubs chose these particular kids
because they displayed certain traits
that matched the characters from the game .
these kids are motivated and positive
when the game goes the way that they want it to .
on the other hand , if the game doesn &apos;t go as well ,
they will be the opposite--
blinded with utter rage .
snap out of it .
all right ? let &apos;s focus .
there &apos;s a key in her sweater pocket . go grab it .
move !
ok . now put it on .
see ? that wasn &apos;t so bad , now , was it ?
so these guys just got together
and decided to pull this thing off ?
you know , something this elaborate ,
it &apos;s likely they &apos;ve known each other for years , actually .
hey , i just got off the phone with the people who produce &quot; gods of combat . &quot;
turns out they have 6 million players worldwide ,
40,000 of which are d.c. residents .
garcia , if they &apos;re capable of this type of violence in real life ,
do you think we &apos;d see some sort of evidence of it
in their gaming history ?
what type of evidence ?
yeah , he &apos;s talking about the universal
online gaming code of conduct .
sure . it prevents against stuff like harassing ,
threatening other players , cyber @-@ bullying , that kind of thing .
how &apos;s this supposed to help us find these kids ?
instead of looking for people who play the game ,
we need to look for people who were kicked out .
what do you think is happening to them ?
i don &apos;t know , wendy .
you think they &apos;re dead ?
i said i don &apos;t know .
come on .
let &apos;s stick together , ok ?
yeah ?
hey , guys , i think i found something .
when i downloaded the tpf file ,
i was able to extract the source code
and generate an outpost based on
blacklisted hell mod players .
english , please ?
oh , yeah .
mod levels are hacked modifications to the game .
they were not a part of the original game design .
they &apos;re secret levels .
the only ones who could find them are those that know they even exist .
and the hell mod in this game was like
a battle royale .
i mean , literally , anything goes . there are no rules .
if you get killed off playing hell mod ,
your entire gaming profile is deleted .
a profile that would have taken years for them to build .
their sudden loss of access to their game
could be what spun them out of control .
let me get this straight .
instead of starting over , they decided to build their own game ?
it &apos;s more than that .
this is a competition .
trent , she &apos;s catching up .
hurry up !
come on , man .
come on ! come on !
damn it !
you blew the lead .
what happened to you ?
don &apos;t listen to her . keep going !
unlock the box , then blow his brains out .
what ?
you complete this mission , you move to the next round .
the next ...
what--what is this ?
make me proud .
i did what you wanted already !
trent , what &apos;s happening ?
focus , dude .
say something !
trent !
you know , i wonder what your family would say .
what , you didn &apos;t think i did my research ?
i can &apos;t believe you &apos;re blowing it !
damn it , trent !
you still live on deep wood lane ?
maybe i should go get your little brother dylan
to come and take your place .
he takes the bus , too , right ?
no .
please don &apos;t hurt them .
hurry up , trent !
use the key to open the box on the table .
you &apos;ll thank me later .
that &apos;s the barrel . it doesn &apos;t fit there .
hurry up . hurry up , addyson , he &apos;s almost there .
load it .
load it ! you got it .
you got it !
go on , shoot him .
shoot him !
shoot her ! shoot her !
yes !
a months ago , two players were kicked out at the same time
for hacking into hell mod . previous to that ,
they both logged thousands of hours playing the game ,
dating back to early 2000 .
you got any names , garcia ?
no , just online handles , but--
you know what &apos;s weird ?
they were both playing from the same ip address .
so they live together .
they &apos;re roommates , maybe ?
or siblings .
did you see that ? she just walked up to him and boom !
it &apos;s just the first round .
trent .
oh , my god .
oh , you felt that rush , didn &apos;t you ?
i knew you would .
no . i didn &apos;t feel anything .
trent , i &apos;m sorry .
he made me do it .
oh , yeah . not knowing whether it was gonna be you or him
lying in that pool of blood .
hey , you gotta pull yourself together .
it &apos;s time to meet your next opponent .
girl .
dude , i beat you with a girl .
i get it .
let me show you again .
let &apos;s go .
come on .
round 2 .
all right .
let &apos;s go , number 4 .
you &apos;re up .
i can &apos;t .
i can &apos;t .
i can &apos;t .
maybe you didn &apos;t understand me the first time .
i &apos;m going .
ok . it &apos;s ok .
i &apos;ll take her place !
i &apos;ll take her place .
dude , no , that &apos;s not part of the rules .
it &apos;s ok .
wait !
no !
wendy ! oh , wendy , god !
why are you doing this ? !
you guys are crazy !
hey , what the hell was that ?
what ? he volunteered . you don &apos;t need her anymore .
she was my player .
oh , come on . she was your pawn .
she was gonna die anyway .
you don &apos;t know that .
can we please get back to the game ?
take the corridor to your left .
there &apos;s a box with a gun near the end .
take it .
you &apos;re gonna need it .
it doesn &apos;t make any sense .
it they are siblings , how do you explain the gaps in time
when they weren &apos;t logged in at the same location ?
yeah , it looks like it happened several times a year ,
sometimes from different states .
maybe their parents got divorced .
maybe the parents got divorced .
maybe the parents got divorced .
leave it to the genius to come up with the obvious .
here we go .
joshua and matthew moore .
they both went to central high .
their parents worked two jobs each to make ends meet .
led to a messy divorce .
joshua went to live with his dad in arizona .
matthew stayed with his mom in d.c.
that &apos;s how they knew when to strike .
they probably rode the same bus route .
long hours , different schedules .
they were latchkey kids .
video games became their sitters .
as they got older , they got more competitive
and it became more about bragging rights .
this game became the core of their sibling rivalry .
only it wasn &apos;t just a game .
&quot; gods of combat &quot; was their one constant connection to one another .
oh , come on , addyson , get over it .
there &apos;s casualties in every war . let &apos;s go .
your enemy &apos;s closing in .
are you all right ? what happened ?
don &apos;t come near me .
oh . what &apos;s going on ? where &apos;s trent ?
take out your gun and shoot her .
she already killed trent .
trent--trent &apos;s dead ?
i had no choice .
you &apos;re going to be next .
it &apos;s either her or you , billy .
no .
they said they &apos;d hurt my family .
shoot her !
now !
i &apos;m sorry , billy .
shoot her .
shoot him !
clear !
clear !
if they &apos;re in here together , why are they using these ?
it &apos;s what they &apos;re using to communicate with their players .
i recognize that &quot; uhh . &quot;
i have gone through every frequency and wavelength ,
and i haven &apos;t been able to pick up on anything .
all right , well , just slow down .
i &apos;m frustrated .
i get that . all right , let &apos;s go back .
you &apos;ve checked audix ?
yes .
all right .
nady systems ? akg ? electrovoice ?
voco pro ?
yes , yes , and yes . i &apos;ve gone through every frequency
in the fricking northern hemisphere and nothing .
i don &apos;t know . i mean , these are the only frequencies that i know
that are aboveground .
wait .
underground .
no , i said aboveground .
e.l.f. you &apos;d need to have extremely low frequency .
it &apos;s the only one that can penetrate underground !
got a hit .
you have lipstick on your face .
picked up a ping on the e.l.f.
it &apos;s emanating from somewhere
in this 25 @-@ mile radius , west of bolivar .
what fits ?
well , there &apos;s a few old factories
and a couple of bunkers from the seventies .
what is this ?
the old paper mill .
you know , given the size and location ,
that could be the perfect spot .
i &apos;m gonna pull the schematics .
find him . he &apos;s in there .
if you miss this time , you &apos;ll be sorry .
oh , come on . it froze !
hello ? can anyone hear me ?
if someone is there , please say something .
my name is penelope and i &apos;m with the fbi .
they &apos;re listening to us .
no , no , wait , listen .
you &apos;re safe . i just-- i isolated the signal .
they can &apos;t hear us right now . what is your name ?
i &apos;m ...
i &apos;m billy .
you gotta help us .
what the hell is he doing ?
why isn &apos;t it working ?
what the hell was that ?
i don &apos;t know . it was working fine a second ago .
damn it !
lost the signal .
i bet that bitch screwed up something with that last shot .
no . somebody &apos;s interfering with the signal .
you did this , didn &apos;t you ?
me ?
what the hell are you talking about ?
matt , you gotta be kidding me .
listen , billy , we are on our way right now .
you just need to hang tight a little while longer .
i know you &apos;re wearing a collar .
yeah .
i &apos;m gonna help you take it off . ok ?
i tried that already . it keeps shocking me .
billy , listen to me .
they can &apos;t hurt you anymore . got it ?
ok .
there you go . ok .
now , i want you to find me something sharp in there .
all right .
remember , when mom and dad split up ,
we made a promise ...
that we &apos;d stick together always .
it &apos;s us against the world , dude .
it &apos;s always been that way .
come on .
put down the gun .
what ? what is it ?
someone hacked into our signal .
they know where we are .
make sure that you--
billy ?
billy , can you hear me ?
what happened ?
they shut down the system .
listen to me , ok ?
the police are on the way .
they can &apos;t hurt us anymore .
ok , addyson ?
hold still . i &apos;m going to get the shock collar off .
i had to reboot the whole system .
it &apos;s gonna be a few hours .
where are you going ?
i &apos;m not waiting .
what are you doing ?
there &apos;s only one way to finish this .
game on .
come on .
ok .
you can do it .
ok .
you got it .
ok .
ok .
no !
where do you think you &apos;re going , huh ?
uh @-@ uh . now is not the time to play hero .
let her go !
unless you want her blood on your hands ,
literally ,
you &apos;ll put the gun down .
billy .
just put it down .
go ahead . listen to the girl .
do it !
you , come on .
come on !
let &apos;s go . that &apos;s it .
that &apos;s it .
billy ...
now , i &apos;m gonna do what my players couldn &apos;t .
drop the gun , matt .
it &apos;s ok , it &apos;s over .
come on .
fbi ! drop your weapon !
i &apos;m agent morgan . this is agent rossi .
we &apos;re the good guys . but drop the gun .
how do i know this isn &apos;t part of the game ?
kid , you gotta trust me ,
just like you trusted my friend penelope .
come on , now . i know you &apos;re scared ,
but don &apos;t do anything stupid .
drop the weapon !
my baby boy !
i &apos;m so sorry , trent .
where &apos;s josh ?
where &apos;s my brother ?
where &apos;s josh ?
you answer me . where &apos;s my brother ?
he &apos;s dead ?
i guess i won .
frederick douglass said ,
&quot; it is easier to build strong children
than to repair broken men . &quot;
hey .
thanks for everything today .
i &apos;m glad i could help .
um , do you want to go and get a drink with me ,
right now , talk ?
i , uh ...
i kind of already have plans .
it &apos;s just that we have reservations and stuff .
yeah , i get it . you don &apos;t have to explain .
i &apos;ll see you around .
right .
see you around .
how you doing ?
do you ever have one of those days
that you want to unplug from everything ...
literally ?
give me your phone .
and your tablet .
and your other phone .
ok . tonight you &apos;re coming to my house .
we &apos;re going to listen to tony bennett on vinyl
and drink 18 @-@ year @-@ old scotch .
i don &apos;t drink scotch .
you &apos;ll learn .
thanks .
