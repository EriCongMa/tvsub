it &apos;s so creative . coupons for hugs ,
which are usually free .
but this makes it official , which is so great .
i was so proud of myself when i thought of it ...
because you &apos;re impossible to buy for .
you never want anything .
um , things i want :
robot dog , night- vision goggles , bug vacuum ,
g.p.s. watch , speakers that look like rocks .
i love my wife , but she sucks at giving gifts .
i &apos;m sorry for the pay- channel language ,
but- oh , yogurt maker .
i can &apos;t not think of things i want .
第一季第八集
i can &apos;t tell if she needs a diaper change .
i &apos;d think we &apos;d be able to tell .
no , with these diapers , it &apos;s hard to tell .
triple leakage protection .
leaklock .
contours to protect her little body .
no gapping or chapping .
cam , do you think that maybe we need a-
night out . yeah .
yeah . yes . just a few hours with a couple of adults ,
few drinks , no baby talk .
it &apos;ll make us better parents .
stop drilling . you &apos;ve struck oil .
we &apos;ll get gloria to babysit . we &apos;re going out .
you got some spittle .
do i ? you know who &apos;d be fun to call ?
sal .
sal .
ooh , raise the roof , lily . yeah .
we &apos;re calling sal .
sal is our very best friend in the whole wide world .
the reason we love her so much ...
is she has absolutely no inhibitions .
no .
and that &apos;s before she starts drinking .
hanging out with her ...
is like an amsterdam saturday night every day of the week .
and , ironically ,
sal &apos;s not allowed back into amsterdam .
any day of the week .
of course we would love to have the baby .
all the other cousins are sleeping over tonight .
the more , the merrier .
okay , see you tonight . bye- bye .
is haley still coming ?
you &apos;re related . i will spray you with the hose .
all the grandkids are
coming over for jay &apos;s night . family tradition .
everybody wears p.j. &apos; s , which they love .
i make my famous sloppy jays , which are really sloppy joes ...
but made by jay , which they love .
and then we all watch a western together ,
which they don &apos;t really care for , but hey , it &apos;s jay &apos;s night .
so , mom , there &apos;s a party tonight at andrew adler &apos;s ,
and everybody &apos;s gonna be there .
ooh , that sounds like so much fun , but i have other plans .
oh , that &apos;s hi- larious . but i &apos;m talking about me .
that &apos;s unusual .
honey ,
you said you &apos;d go to your grandfather &apos;s tonight .
see , that &apos;s what &apos;s so perfect about this .
andrew only lives , like , a couple blocks away from grandpa &apos;s .
so i figured that i could go-
sweetie , you made a commitment .
but i really want to go . plus , every time i go over to grandpa &apos;s ,
manny just stares at me the whole time .
maybe if you wore a bra-
alex .
what ? i can &apos;t wait to go to grandpa &apos;s .
family means everything to me .
&apos;cause you have no friends .
no . because i love grandpa .
and he &apos;s getting older .
who knows how many years he has left ?
is grandpa dying ?
didn &apos;t they tell you ?
alex , stop torturing your brother .
no . your grandfather is fine .
for now .

you expecting someone special ?
thank you .

i &apos;m sorry .
oh , what are you apologizing for ? they &apos;re gorgeous .
that &apos;s too much . with the view- master and the bracelet ...
and the flowers and the balloons-
balloons ?
they &apos;re attached to your car .
i just don &apos;t want you to feel bad ...
about your little ... coupons .
wait a minute . you- you
thought the coupons were your only present ?
are you kidding me ?
they aren &apos;t ?
no ! oh , phil , come on .
it &apos;s our anniversary .
those coupons were just , like ,
a fun little way to kick off the day .
your real present is coming tonight , and you &apos;re gonna love it .

that &apos;s why it &apos;s in the noodle . so i guess-
no . what album is that on ?
second . i wanna say second .
what &apos;s on the cover ?
there &apos;s a warlock , i think , or a seascape .
warlock . oh . millennium sunrise .
millennium sunrise .
there is no millennium sunrise record .
what- what ? you &apos;re not a fandau .
you didn &apos;t even know who i was at the door .
i saw it in your eyes .
please don &apos;t say anything to claire .
she made a mistake .
am i being punk &apos;d ?
this means so much to her , and i don &apos;t wanna hurt her feelings .
her feelings ? well , what about my feelings ?
this is my career , man .
you know , my music was the soundtrack to people &apos;s lives .
now i &apos;m nothing . how do you think that feels ?
this is really humiliating .
no , no , no . don &apos;t go . don &apos;t go .
hey . what are you guys doing ?
he let me touch it !
yeah , i think she said &quot; kill , &quot; cam . i do .
maybe it was just a joke . she &apos;s always had a dark sense of humor .
that &apos;s true . remember her halloween costume ?
when she came as siegfried and part of roy .
it was too soon .
yeah . yeah . this was just a joke .
yes . yeah . here she comes .
look , i &apos;m gonna bring up lily . we &apos;ll see what she says .
show her some pictures .
pay up , bitches .
whoa . more drinks .
free drinks .
sal , you &apos;ve got to look at these pictures .
what are they ?
it &apos;s lily at the zoo .
oh , cute .
look at that one .
cute ! cute . cutie , cutie , cute , et cetera .
so you guys are gonna have to bring lily to cabo ,
now that you &apos;re the guys that always bring lily ?
well , you know-
yeah , probably .
i will throw her in the ocean .
what ?
i said i gotta go pee .
okay , that wasn &apos;t even close .
nope .
i mean , what do we do ? do we say something ?
how do we even bring it up ?
she threatened our child , and that &apos;s your concern- a segue ?
you know what this is ?
what ?
this is first- child syndrome .
what ?
it &apos;s where the first child is happy ,
and then the second child comes along ,
and the first child gets jealous of the second child
and starts acting out .
yes . that &apos;s brilliant , except sal &apos;s not our child , so-
think about it . listen , we &apos;ve practically done everything for her .
we &apos;ve held her when she &apos;s cried .
we &apos;ve carried her when she couldn &apos;t walk .
we &apos;ve done everything but potty- train her .
um- hey , guys .
i was thinking- oh .
oh . sorry .
when we go to cabo ,
we have to find a hotel with a swim- up bar ,
&apos;cause this going back and forth to the bathroom is a fool &apos;s game .
okay , let &apos;s get more drinks .
sal , we got to talk .
it &apos;s about lily .
oh , shocker .
okay .
do you think it &apos;s at all possible ...
that maybe- maybe you &apos;re jealous of her ?
what ? what ?
it &apos;s just-
i don &apos;t know .
i don &apos;t- where- why would you say that ?
well , because you won &apos;t look at any pictures of her ...
and you talked about killing her and throwing her in the ocean .
okay , that was a joke , you guys . come on .
fine . show me the pictures of yoko .
see , it &apos;s ...
it &apos;s a joke . you guys ! come on .
&apos;cause she &apos;s asian , and she broke up our group .
i- i just- look , let &apos;s at least
acknowledge that things have changed between us .
and you know what ?
because lily &apos;s here doesn &apos;t mean we love you any less .
no . absolutely not .
what &apos;s wrong ?
we used to be really close , and
you used to call me a lot . and now you never call me .
well , but we-
no .
and last week i had a really bad dream ,
and i was thinking , &quot; okay , i &apos;m gonna call them . &quot;
and then i thought , &quot; oh , no , you can &apos;t call them ...
because you might wake up their baby . &quot;
you can always call .
oh , honey , always call us .
no . i &apos;m sorry we haven &apos;t been there .
we &apos;re here now , okay ?
okay ?
feel better ?
i think you just put a little-
spittle ?
did she just fall asleep ?
i wish lily would fall asleep like that .
give her eight shots of tequila .
i don &apos;t understand why she &apos;s not falling asleep .
i have a theory .
i got the movie .
manny , why don &apos;t you go fire up some popcorn ?
you looking for these ?
you took my shoes ?
no , i took your freedom .
sorry , kid . it ain &apos;t your night .
why are you being like this ?
i just wanted to go to that party for , like , two hours .
i would &apos;ve been back by now . would that have killed you ?
she &apos;s just like her mother .
why are you treating haley like this ?
me ? she &apos;s the one acting like a pill .
you &apos;re taking this too personally .
when i was haley &apos;s age , i loved my grandfather ,
but i still wanted to go to parties and be with boys .
i know . i know . so did claire ... and mitchell .
but you know what ?
you try to put something over on me , you &apos;re gonna lose .
so , what ? now you &apos;re gonna make this into a big game ?
i &apos;m trying to keep &apos; em around a little bit longer , that &apos;s all .
i mean , who knows how many nights like this i got left ?
i miss you already .
what &apos;s wrong with this kid tonight ?
go in the kitchen and help out the guys , and i &apos;ll be right in .
it &apos;s great that you wanna spend time with your granddaughter ,
but is this really the way ?
fine .
you &apos;re a good abuelo .
she &apos;s upstairs .
i know .
dylan !
yeah ?
get up .
you &apos;re here to take haley to the party , right ?
yeah .
she &apos;s in the house .
how did you know i was here ?
this is how i first met phil .
thanks again , grandpa . we &apos;ll be back by 11 : 00 .
i will track you down .
i believe that .
what &apos;s that smell ?
sloppy jays . help yourself .
there &apos;s plenty left .
oh . sloppy jays because your name &apos;s jay .
right on .
can &apos;t believe she &apos;s into this guy .
if you want , i &apos;ll fix you a plate .
yeah , definitely . that &apos;d be great .
but what about the party ?
we can go in just a minute . just let-
oh , no way . the gunfighter . i love this movie .
dylan , the party .
oh . but ... cowboys .
don &apos;t fight it , haley . they never grow up .
thanks .
i &apos;m going to the kitchen for an espresso .
anybody need anything ?
no , thanks .
okay .
two , three , four .
the year was 1991 .
america was immersed in desert storm .
meanwhile , stateside , another storm was brewing ...
in my heart .
this is stupid , isn &apos;t it ? this is-
no .
is it stupid , phil ?
no . just keep- keep going , claire .
it &apos;s wonderful .
okay .
after a romantic dinner at fratelli &apos;s ,
a certain nervous young couple shared their first kiss ...
as the radio played this song .
* so true *
* funny how it seems *
* always in time *
* but never in line for dreams *
* head over heels when toe to toe *
* this is the sound of- *
you know what ? no . no . sorry . sorry . not gonna do it .
what &apos;s wrong ?
what &apos;s going on ?
do you even know the name of this song ?
p- &quot; true . &quot;
&quot; true . &quot;
&quot; true . &quot;
right . this is false . see ?
i &apos;m not gonna play &quot; true &quot; for someone who &apos;s false .
see , he doesn &apos;t- he doesn &apos;t even know the band .
he &apos;s not a fan , a fandau .
yes , he does know the band .
of course he does . &apos; cause this is our song .
you love this song . tell him this is our song .
right . tell him , phil .
it &apos;s not our song , claire .
our song is
&quot; if you leave &quot; by orchestral manoeuvres in the dark .
oh !
are you sure ?
pretty sure . i sang it at our wedding .
oh , i &apos;m an idiot .
well , actually , he &apos;s the idiot .
he fell in love to a break- up song .
ignore him . this is beautiful .
i love it .
i hate this . i hate this .
you &apos;re so sweet and nice , and i can &apos;t even give you ...
a decent anniversary present .
i love you so much , and i feel you just are never gonna know it .
i know it . i know it .
you do know it ?
yes .
you do ?
and this is an awesome gift .
you know why ?
why ?
you just gave us a new song .
okay .
sort of brought you back together , eh ?
seems .
sort of .
rekindled fires of a dying passion ?
sure .
shot a ray of hope into this gloomy suburban lie ?
all right , buddy .
just play it , lzzy .
for you , claire .
* i know this *
* much is true *
* i know this *
* much is true *
she is so sweet .
isn &apos;t she ?
like a little angel .
let me hold her .
oh , thank god .
