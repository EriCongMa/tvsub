第一季 第十五集
what are you looking at ?
not what , who .
that new kid ?
i don &apos;t wanna go there . i heard he &apos;s sketchy .
you should probably go first ,
and i &apos;ll count to 50 .
okay .
i barely remember jason .
we didn &apos;t know him ,
he was just ali &apos;s older brother down the hall .
if that &apos;s alison &apos;s bracelet ,
what about the one we found in the woods ?
someone made a copy of alison &apos;s bracelet .
well , if the bank finds out about your unauthorized loan ,
that &apos;s ... it &apos;s like a felony , right ?
it &apos;s only a felony if they find out .
hey , was that maya ?
how is she ?
it &apos;s all good .
i &apos;m not sensing good here , emily .
maybe she &apos;s moved on .
find a better place to hide it .
there &apos;s a shadow right there ,
like someone was following her .
spence , do you know who that is ?
uh ... i have no idea .
wait . where &apos;s ian ?
don &apos;t worry , he went to philly to be with melissa .
i didn &apos;t realize life existed at this hour .
come on , guys , just walk . you need to see this .
i always hoped my first sunrise would have tequila in it .
i &apos;ll make coffee .
well , when it &apos;s ready just pour it down my throat .
i thought we were done looking at this .
i mean , we know the shadow is ian , right ?
you woke us up for this ?
it &apos;s important .
i couldn &apos;t let it go .
have you been up all night ?
maybe .
you have .
one eye is bigger than the other .
you look like a strung out power puff girl .
stop looking at the eye . just look at the picture .
who &apos;s having coffee ?
there &apos;s only one place where this picture could have been taken from .
where ?
alison &apos;s bedroom .
no , alison is in the picture . she clearly didn &apos;t take that .
okay , but somebody in her house did .
like who , her parents ?
no . her brother .
jason .
you know , my mom ran into him at the bank .
he &apos;s back in town .
why ?
we have to call him .
eww . i am not going to talk to him .
me either .
i will .
we need to know if he took this .
okay , can you move that meeting up ?
i &apos;ll need to be on the road by four .
okay , great .
let &apos;s go over the schedule for the rest of the week .
would you pass me a banana ?
that got moved to thursday .
what ?
when did that get on the schedule ?
n @-@ no , it &apos;s fine .
did she say what the appointment &apos;s about ?
i &apos;m just surprised , that &apos;s all .
okay . thanks , denise .
i &apos;ll see you when i get in .
what just happened ?
mrs. potter made an appointment to see me this week .
the lender ... of our unauthorized loan .
i thought she came to the bank once a year .
yeah , well , she &apos;s a year early ,
and i &apos;m $ 50,000 short .
what are we gonna do ?
you &apos;re gonna go to school .
hey .
hey ...
jason . i &apos;m--
i &apos;m sorry to interrupt your workout . this can wait .
really . it didn &apos;t sound that way on the phone .
what are you doing back in town ?
just ... taking care of family business .
spencer , why did you come here ?
this was sent to me .
it looks like it was taken from the second floor of your house .
yeah . it does .
so , why do you sound not convinced ?
look , after ali disappeared ,
we got bizarre things in the mail .
sympathy cards from strangers
and letters with conspiracy theories about what happened to her ...
sometimes it was photos--
blurry images of a blond girl running away from the camera .
but that &apos;s definitely ali . and it &apos;s my yard .
and it was taken the night that she disappeared .
i mean , look . she &apos;s got the same yellow top on .
spencer , they have programs now
that make photoshop look like scissors and a glue stick .
look , i &apos;ll tell you what .
my family hired a p.i. ,
i &apos;ll take the picture to him and see what he comes up with .
spencer .
ali &apos;s memorial was the hardest thing i &apos;ve ever done .
i was a jerk .
i @-@ i know that now .
well , that wasn &apos;t the term that i would have used , but ...
it works .
good time .
ease up , fields .
this is a practice , not a meet .
looks like somebody ate their wheaties this morning .
way to hustle , emily .
thanks , coach .
paige , looks like you &apos;ve got some competition .
emily , remember , she likes to win .
happy to have her back .
so , is this for real this time ?
can we count on you for the full season ?
yeah . i was distracted for a while , but ...
that &apos;s over now .
okay . good .
hanna , stop worrying .
there &apos;s no thing we can do at this point .
i &apos;ll talk to you later , okay ?
hanna . hi .
who are you talking to ?
my mom .
is everything okay ?
uh--yeah . everything &apos;s fine .
oh ! here .
i forgot to give these to you last night .
thank you .
oh , i owe you big @-@ time .
are you sure your dad &apos;s not gonna miss these ?
oh , please .
he joined the museum board for networking .
the man doesn &apos;t know the difference between a monet and a mojito .
well , hey , how can i get you back ?
pay for the extra toppings on my pizza delivery .
all right , you got it .
oh , and a dvd rental ,
because if i have to hole up in my room all night as your alibi ,
i would like to do it with jake gyllenhaal .
wait . what alibi ?
aren &apos;t you both going to the museum thingie ?
no , um ...
spencer got the tickets for ...
me and ezra .
you &apos;re taking mr. fitz ?
i really wish you &apos;d just call him ezra .
and yes , i &apos;m taking him .
he just ... doesn &apos;t know it yet .
it &apos;s a surprise .
i don &apos;t know , i just figured that a date out of town
would give us a chance to actually have a date .
yeah . uh , i get it .
you guys do kind of have the social lives of shut @-@ ins .
girls ?
hi .
hey , everyone ?
can i get everyone &apos;s attention , please ?
i &apos;ve been thinking a lot about team spirit lately .
what is spirit ? and how can we create--
actually , can you not open your presents until after i &apos;m done ?
like i was saying ,
a leader inspires spirit .
these are my gift to you to boost morale--
all righty , paige ,
i &apos;m sure everybody appreciates your gifts ,
but i want you swimmin &apos; , not shoppin &apos; .
all right ! listen up , sharks !
i want you focused .
like emily .
she renewed her commitment and broke a record today !
that &apos;s what i &apos;m talkin &apos; about ! i like that !
all right , ladies , let &apos;s get back to class .
come on ! come on !
hey , paige ,
i just--
hey .
miss montgomery . what can i do for you ?
i was wondering if you could look over my reading assignment .
perhaps this could wait until after the makeup test has been administered .
actually ...
it would be great if you could just review it now
so i know i &apos;m on the right track ?
okay .
what do you think of my work so far ?
looks outstanding .
great .
then i &apos;ll turn it in at the end of the day .
great .
hi , this is shley marin .
please leave me a message , i &apos;ll get back to you .
hanna , we missed you in p.e. again today .
i missed you too .
oh . well , that &apos;s the third time you &apos;ve ditched p.e. ,
so i &apos;m gonna have to give you detention for the rest of the week .
excuse me , but my ankle is still throbbing .
mm @-@ hmm . i don &apos;t know if you heard , but i got hit by a car .
i heard , but i also saw you complete
the six @-@ hour dance marathon on saturday .
that was for a good cause , and my adrenaline kicked in .
you know when moms get super @-@ human strength
when their kids are trapped under a tree or , uh , a hummer ?
is that who pulled you out from under the car ?
okay , well , call your super @-@ mommy
and tell her that you &apos;ll be coming home late this week .
skipping gym ?
if you really want to earn some bad girl stripes ,
i &apos;d be happy to help .
if you &apos;re proposing that we get matching tattoos ,
the answer is no .
母亲 : 我需要钱
让艾瑞亚妈妈看看她女儿在隐瞒什么吧
mom ?
hey , sweetie .
what &apos;s happening ? what are you doing ?
i , uh , i thought i &apos;d make some pancakes .
i haven &apos;t made &apos; em in a while .
you want to get the mix ? it &apos;s in that cabinet .
you know , i didn &apos;t tell you this ,
but when you were in the hospital and they ...
gave you the stitches behind your ear ,
they wanted to shave off all your hair on that side .
and i told them , &quot; no way .
&quot; i know my kid , and she may be unconscious now ,
&quot; but if she wakes up with a shaved head ,
she is gonna go into permanent shock . &quot;
i want you to know
that no matter what happens ,
you will always ... be my baby girl ,
and i will always figure out a way to take care of you .
you want some bacon ? i &apos;ll make some bacon .
pretty .
thanks .
congratulations on your times today .
first freestyle , now butterfly--
you break any more records and we &apos;ll have to test you for doping .
bring it on .
you know , you &apos;ll have to do more than break records
if you want to become team captain .
who said i wanted to become captain ?
come on , emily .
you checked out on this team for months ,
and now you check back in and act like you never left ?
of course you &apos;re gunning for captain .
i &apos;m not gunning for anything .
good .
because being so into the breast stroke
could really end up hurting you .
what does that mean ?
it means we all know what team you really play for .
you know what , paige ? you need to suck it up .
if you want to beat me , work harder .
玫瑰镇家长教师联谊会
hey , han .
oh , hey .
so , i &apos;m gonna get a mani @-@ pedi after school .
do you want to come ?
uh , i can &apos;t . i &apos;ve got homework .
homework ?
what subject is more important to you than your cuticles ?
why are you so down ?
is it about you and sean breaking up ?
that doesn &apos;t mean you give up on him .
believe me ,
with all the stuff that ezra and i have had to deal with ,
we should have been history by now .
well , maybe it &apos;s a sign from the universe .
maybe you guys should just ... cool off for a while .
what do you mean &quot; cool off &quot; ?
take a break .
don &apos;t see each other in rosewood
or ... anyplace else .
honestly ?
i can deal with the universe throwing me curveballs ,
but if they &apos;re gonna start coming from my best friend ,
then i have a problem .
aria , you have to sneak off to philly
just to have a date with him .
you really don &apos;t want me to be with him .
i don &apos;t want you to get hurt .
he &apos;s not the one who &apos;s hurting me .
please , just don &apos;t go tonight , okay ?
i have a bad feeling about this date .
i think that bad feeling is called &quot; jealousy . &quot;
that &apos;s not what this is about .
really ?
because that &apos;s exactly what it looks like .
why is this called &quot; meat &quot; casserole ?
that lunch lady has a gift for suspense .
where &apos;s hanna ?
who cares .
what ?
i don &apos;t know .
em , how &apos;s swim practice ?
can we talk about something else ?
okay . i &apos;ve heard of communal cramps , but this is ridiculous .
what happened to all that &quot; first real date &quot; excitement ?
i mean , yesterday you were ready
to give me tongue for giving you two tickets .
you &apos;re not into it anymore ?
no .
i mean , yes .
yeah , i &apos;m ... so into it .
we &apos;re ... gonna have an amazing time tonight .
okay , so ...
talk . what are you gonna wear ?
i can &apos;t decide between my backless or my strapless .
go with the red one . be bold . what do you think , em ?
about what ?
what are you looking at ?
it &apos;s nothing .
just some girl on my swim team who wants me to disappear .
what &apos;s her name ?
paige mccullers
oh . i know her .
we played field hockey together . we named a penalty after her .
what &apos;d she say ?
some snarky comment about me being gay .
i will destroy her .
can i help ?
it &apos;s okay . i took care of it .
anyone else thirsty ? i &apos;m gonna get a drink .
who &apos;s this from ?
paige . whatever it is , you can have it .
she &apos;s trying to bribe her way to becoming the next team captain .
do you ... think they &apos;re from the same place ?
it &apos;s possible .
if they were ,
maybe the store owner could tell us
who bought the fake alison bracelet .
yeah , or maybe even the jenna one .
and we would know who &quot; a &quot; is .
there &apos;s only one way to find out .
chamberlain employed a policy where concessions were made
in order to avoid war .
who can tell me if appeasement actually worked ?
anybody ?
it didn &apos;t .
when the territory was annexed ,
hitler &apos;s aggression only increased .
would anybody like to share their thoughts
on why appeasement did not work ?
spencer .
because giving in to a bully never works .
can you elaborate on that a little bit ?
even if you give them everything that they ask for ,
it &apos;ll never be enough .
your only choice is to stand up to them ,
even if it costs you something .
very nice .
okay , people , please do not race me towards the door ,
it hurts my feelings .
term paper is next week . don &apos;t forget .
mrs. montgomery !
ms. marin , detention is that way .
i know , but i have to talk to mrs . montgomery .
it &apos;ll have to wait until tomorrow .
it can &apos;t . i have to talk to her today .
you should have thought of that earlier . move it .
take it inside , take it inside .
are you stalking me ?
yeah . can &apos;t get enough of that knock @-@ off cologne .
hey , princess . where ya goin &apos; ?
the princess needs a pee .
good luck . we get our bathroom break at ten after .
i have got to get out of here .
what &apos;s the hurry ?
you want to be the first in line to see your boy justin bieber &apos;s new movie ?
first of all , it &apos;s not just a movie-- it &apos;s his real story .
about what--his hair ?
you know what , just don &apos;t talk about the beebs , okay ?
you don &apos;t know the beebs , you don &apos;t understand the beebs .
or his hair .
calm down , girl . it &apos;s only an hour .
in an hour she &apos;ll already be in philly .
who ?
mrs. montgomery .
the teacher ? why do you care ?
forget to turn in your homework ?
no .
but if she gets there ...
a lot of people are gonna get hurt .
is mrs. montgomery running a terrorist cell ?
why am i even talking to you ?
just turn around , sketchy .
why do you get to leave ?
my social worker just had me excused .
you know , email is a beautiful thing .
meet my social worker .
hello .
hey , where are you ?
you look good .
i @-@ i thought we were taking the train .
i know you had your heart
set on being coughed on by commuters , but ..
so this is what a real date with ezra fitz looks like . damn .
you can hang up now .
i got a message you wanted to see me .
have a seat , girls .
an incident involving a homophobic comment
has been brought to my attention .
now , we have a zero tolerance policy--
coach walton ,
whatever happened between us , it &apos;s over now .
i need to know what happened ,
and then i &apos;ll decide if it &apos;s over .
there is really nothing to talk about .
in that case , you can go , paige .
emily , if you don &apos;t tell me what happened ,
there &apos;s nothing i can do to help you .
it was just a misunderstanding .
can i go ?
did you turn the key quickly ?
yes , i did . any quicker and it &apos;ll snap off in my hand .
of course the car had to break down when i &apos;m on my way to an art opening .
why couldn &apos;t it break down when i &apos;m on my way to , say ,
i don &apos;t know , jury duty ?
it hasn &apos;t broken down . it &apos;s the kill switch .
try it again . go ahead , jiggle it .
i did jiggle it .
well , try it again .
i wouldn &apos;t have to master the finer art of jiggling
if you had just listened to me in the first place .
ella , please , not again .
i begged you not to buy a used car with a kill switch .
you didn &apos;t even know what a kill switch was .
it &apos;s a switch that stops the flow of electricity to the engine
so that thieves cannot steal the car !
well , now you know , after i explained it to you .
that &apos;s it .
i will hitchhike .
instead of making me drive all the way
out of my way to help you .
i did call aaa ,
and we have used up our entire towing allowances .
that &apos;s not possible .
it is when you drive a used car with a stupid kill switch !
jason .
your housekeeper let me in ,
said i could wait for you here .
so ... what did your private investigator say ?
well , the picture ...
is real .
and for all i know , i may have taken it .
what do you mean you may have taken it ?
i honestly don &apos;t remember .
i &apos;m not proud of it ,
but that whole august is a blur .
i was high for most of it .
you were ?
are you surprised ?
well ...
it &apos;s just to me you were always
ali &apos;s strange older brother .
we never saw you . you were always behind a closed door .
yeah--
getting high with a bunch of losers .
ian ? ian thomas ?
we partied that whole summer .
after he broke up with your sister ,
he practically lived at my house .
but ian &apos;s a triathlete .
he &apos;s the poster boy for preppy .
poster boy by day and party boy by night .
convincing though , isn &apos;t he ?
ah , i don &apos;t get it . this always fixes it .
you can only repair things so many times
before they break for good .
what the hell is that supposed to mean ?
i was talking about the car .
you sure about that ?
yes .
you know what , just leave it alone . i can call a cab .
maybe next time you &apos;ll find a date classy enough
to pick you up .
i &apos;m not meeting a date .
this ticket was given to me by the p.t.a.
one ticket .
you &apos;re the one wearing a new shirt-- are you going on a date ?
oh , my god ...
you &apos;re going on a date .
ella , i don &apos;t want to
you bought a new shirt for this person .
why didn &apos;t you just say something ?
because this is not something i want to discuss .
have you been working out ?
ella .
what ?
you walked out on me . remember ?
i think i need to call a cab
uh , if i &apos;m going to make it on time .
no , i &apos;ll drive you .
no , no , no .
we both don &apos;t have to be late .
no . you &apos;re not gonna be late , and neither am i.
all right ? it &apos;s fine , i &apos;ll drive you .
wow . i can &apos;t believe ian
spent that whole summer at alison &apos;s house .
watching alison .
i &apos;m officially creeped out .
can you be creeped out and eat at the same time ? faster ?
why do we have to eat dinner at four @-@ thirty ?
because this appointment is at five ,
and it &apos;s far away ,
and i don &apos;t know how long we &apos;re gonna be there .
we both know what happens to me when my blood sugar drops .
why do i have to eat ?
oh . i guess you don &apos;t .
and why &apos;d you have to make an appointment for a bead shop ?
because this shop is at her home .
sounds like she makes dream catchers in her kitchen .
are you sure you don &apos;t want that ?
i &apos;m stuffed .
if i eat any more i &apos;ll be swimming in two lanes .
that &apos;s okay . you can have your lane and paige &apos;s lane .
did the coach kick her off the team ?
what do you mean ?
for what she said .
how did you know the coach knew about that ?
because i told her .
what ?
you spoke to my coach ? why would you do that ?
because that girl has been bullying people since j.v.
and she needs to be put in her place .
she was--by me , when it happened .
why are you so mad ?
i didn &apos;t think you &apos;d care
if i spoke to your coach .
i thought you were fine with
people knowing that you and maya were a couple .
i am .
i &apos;m not upset that the coach knows i &apos;m gay .
i &apos;m mad because
if i wanted her to know what paige had said ,
i would have told her myself .
i &apos;m not some helpless little lamb .
i know that ,
but you &apos;re my friend
and i didn &apos;t want her to get away with it .
well , i can stand up for myself .
well , you never did with alison .
thank you for making sure my feelings didn &apos;t get hurt .
emily , i &apos;m sorry
i have to go .
i just remembered i have a test tomorrow .
sorry ,
i just needed a breath of fresh air .
it &apos;s cool .
i can &apos;t believe the artist is a no @-@ show .
right ? if somebody threw me a party
with champagne and crab cakes
to celebrate my work ,
i think i &apos;d try and stop by .
yeah . if it were my work ,
i &apos;d show up if people put out folding chairs
and sweaty jeans .
plus , i &apos;d be there .
true .
are you disappointed that the artist didn &apos;t show up ?
no .
the only person i cared about seeing is you .
i &apos;m sorry . for a second i forgot i was--
not in rosewood ?
it &apos;s okay . me too .
when i first saw the limo ,
i thought i was gonna have to ride in the trunk .
yeah . i could get used to this .
ready for more culture ?
lead the way .
hi , mom .
what are you doing here ?
i couldn &apos;t just sit around in my room and wait .
what are you gonna say to her ?
i need you to go home .
why can &apos;t you just tell her the truth ?
hanna , please .
i can &apos;t lose you , too .
so sorry to interrupt .
i just got off the phone with mrs. potter &apos;s housekeeper .
she called from the hospital .
mrs. potter had a heart attack .
is she going to be okay ?
they couldn &apos;t revive her .
poor thing . i mean , she wasn &apos;t young , but still ...
thank you for telling me , denise .
i know , baby .
that smell never went away .
it came with the car .
no , actually it came from mike dropping a turkey wrap
underneath the driver &apos;s seat , remember ?
it had been there for , like , a year or something ?
more .
by the time we found it , you thought it was roast beef .
i did .
ah . yeah .
oh , you have enough cash for a cab ride home ?
yeah .
okay .
well , so , i guess that &apos;s it .
have a good time .
thanks .
i can &apos;t believe you drove me all the way here .
why ?
i just--
i don &apos;t know anybody else who would do that for me .
well , it &apos;s only fair . i mean , i was the one
who suggested that we buy a used car with a kill switch .
goodbye .
goodbye .
well , i know it &apos;s in here somewhere .
oh , here it is .
i have wonderful earrings to match .
thanks , but , um , i just came here
to find out who bought these two bracelets .
oh , well , let me see .
well , i can tell you
these bracelets were made within the last six months .
i changed vendors . people were complaining about the clasps .
you do keep records , right ?
yes , dear , i &apos;m trying ,
but as you can see ,
i &apos;m a little better at beading than organizing .
please , it &apos;s important to me .
wait a minute .
here it is !
you found it ?
yes ! now , these two were purchased
by a spencer hastings .
does that help , dear ?
aria ?
hey .
i was just calling you .
yeah , i &apos;ve kind of been avoiding you .
i kind of got that feeling .
listen , i need to tell you something .
last night--
last night was one of the best nights of my life .
wait . did you go to the museum ?
yeah , in a limo .
and the only thing that made it less than perfect
was being in a fight with you .
i &apos;m sorry , hanna ,
i &apos;m ... i &apos;m sorry for going off on you like that .
and you &apos;re right , okay ? being with ezra , it &apos;s a risk ...
but he &apos;s someone that i &apos;m willing to take a risk for .
i know it sounds stupid .
no , it doesn &apos;t .
i get it .
so , what did you want to say ?
nothing . um ...
i &apos;m just really glad it worked out .
what the hell ? !
i saw the lineup .
i know what you &apos;re doing .
what are you talking about ?
coach replaced me as the relay anchor with you .
so go and talk to coach ! like you did ?
i would never rat out a teammate because my feelings were hurt .
i take care of things myself .
you are like one of those things that sticks to the side of boats
that can only be removed with a hacksaw or something .
very nice .
i thought fancy rosewood girls like you
knew how to say &quot; please &quot; and &quot; thank you . &quot;
well , please peel your sweaty body
off of my locker .
thank you .
so , you want to give it back to your teacher , toss it ,
or , uh , put it on your charm bracelet ?
what is that ?
it &apos;s what stopped mrs. montgomery from getting to philly .
she didn &apos;t get there ? how do you do that ?
you want a lesson in popular mechanics ,
or do you want to just say thank you ?
neither .
so , how much do i owe you ?
i don &apos;t want your money .
well , then , what do you want ?
i &apos;ll think about it .
oh , and , by the way , they &apos;re barnacles .
what ?
the things that stick on the side of boats .
hey , i was just going to text you .
why ? what &apos;s up ?
i was wondering what you were doing after school today
and hoping you might want to go clothes shopping with me .
sure . why the sudden urge to splurge ?
i just think it &apos;s time to upgrade a little .
so , how was your sleep @-@ over at spencer &apos;s ?
oh , you know . the usual .
chick flick , popcorn , cosmo quiz , lights out .
how about you ?
uh , me ? um , i had a great night .
oh , yeah ? what &apos;d you do ?
i went to see this really wonderful exhibit .
what ?
yeah , they had a big opening
at the philadelphia art museum .
you--you went last night ?
yeah .
oh , i know , partying on a school night ,
i know i &apos;m out of control , but ...
it was great , it was really exciting to meet the artist .
it was really exciting .
so , anyhow , i have to get to class , and so do you ,
so meet me in my office after .
yeah . sure .
okay .
keep your voice down .
why ? nobody &apos;s home .
yeah , but melissa could come home any minute .
good . i want her to .
why are you making me do this ?
why do you care if she knows ?
i &apos;m not making you do anything , spencer .
i &apos;m telling you , by tomorrow morning
melissa will know everything ,
and there &apos;s nothing you can do about it
except let her hear it from you first .
fine .
i &apos;ll tell her .
you win .
but this it is ,
because i am sick of your games .
we all are .
you trying to get me voted off the island ?
it won &apos;t work .
i don &apos;t think you &apos;ll have much of a choice .
i made you , spencer .
i made all of you .
before me , you were just some goody @-@ goody in plaid
who did whatever mommy and daddy told her to .
you are so full of yourself !
you think that just because you brought us together
you can treat us like puppets ?
but you are . don &apos;t you see that ?
you don &apos;t exist without me .
really , ali ?
then tell me this--
what is a leader without any followers ?
because it seems to me the
question isn &apos;t whether we will exist without you ,
but whether you will exist without us .
and as far as i &apos;m concerned , you are dead to me already .
so the shadow in the picture isn &apos;t ian , it &apos;s you ?
yeah .
why didn &apos;t you tell us before ?
i don &apos;t know .
i guess that i was scared .
this is gonna sound crazy .
but i think that i didn &apos;t tell you
because there was always a part of me
that wondered if it was my fault .
i mean , i wished it , and then it came true .
oh , spence , you didn &apos;t mean it .
it was just something you said in the heat of the moment .
besides , ali said stuff to us that was worse-- much worse--right ?
spence ?
oh , my god !
is that ...
it &apos;s jason .
beading is hard on the eyes , you know ?
oh , don &apos;t be startled .
that &apos;s just my pet . where was i ?
oh , yeah , the eyes .
you have interesting eyes , dear .
the eyes are the window to the soul .
not to worry , dear .
