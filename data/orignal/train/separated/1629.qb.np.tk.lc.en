so you are considering going into experimental physics ,
my door is always open .
once again , i &apos;m sorry
that the demonstration didn &apos;t quite work out ,
but now we know what happens
when you accidentally spill
peach snapple into a helium neon laser .
short answer is ... don &apos;t .
and now to tell you about the theoretical physics department
is dr. sheldon cooper .
dr. cooper ?
forget it .
excuse me .
sheldon , we both agreed to do this .
it &apos;s a waste of time .
i might as well explain the laws of thermodynamics
to a bunch of labradoodles .
if you don &apos;t do this ,
i won &apos;t take you to the comic book store .
hello .
nice work with the laser , by the way .
looking out at your fresh young faces ,
i remember when i too was deciding my academic future
as a lowly graduate student .
of course , i was 14 .
and i &apos;d already achieved more than most of you
could ever hope to , despite my 9 : 00 bedtime .
now , there may be one or two of you in this room
who has what it takes to succeed in theoretical physics .
although , it &apos;s more likely that you &apos;ll spend
your scientific careers teaching fifth graders
how to make papier mache volcanoes
with baking soda lava .
oh , good god .
in short--
any one who told you that you would someday be able
to make any significant contribution to physics ,
played a cruel trick on you , a cruel trick indeed .
any questions ?
of course not .
i weep for the future of science .
now if you &apos;ll excuse me ,
the latest issue of batman is out .
come , leonard .
laser demonstration &apos;s looking pretty good now , huh ?
i love this time of the year .
the leaves are turning ,
there &apos;s a bracing chill in the air .
plus there &apos;s a whole new crop of female grad students
about to put on just enough winter weight
to make them needy and vulnerable .
that &apos;s right , honey , have another calzone .
daddy can wait .
isn &apos;t there a university policy
against dating graduate students ?
no , if you can talk to them , you can ask them out .
damn , there &apos;s always a catch .
hey , guys .
hey , leslie .
so , dumbass , i heard you made a grad student
throw up last night .
the truth can indeed be a finger down the throat
of those unprepared to hear it .
but why should i cater to second @-@ rate minds ?
because first @-@ rate minds call you &quot; dumbass &quot; ?
oh , yeah ? well ...
you &apos;re a mean person .
excuse me , dr. cooper ,
i &apos;m ramona nowitzki .
i was at your talk last night .
i think you &apos;re just brilliant .
that is the prevailing opinion .
oh , now i &apos;m gonna throw up .
howard wolowitz , department of engineering ,
co @-@ designer of the international space station &apos;s
liquid waste disposal system .
ew .
dr. cooper , i &apos;ve read everything you &apos;ve published .
i especially liked your paper on grand unification
using string @-@ network condensates
and were wondering how you determined
that three @-@ dimensional string @-@ nets provided
a unified picture of fermions
and gauge bosons ?
amazing , an intelligent labradoodle .
woof .
the fact is i &apos;m quite close to a breakthrough
in showing how neutrinos emerge
from a string @-@ net condensate .
oh , my god , that would change the way we view
the entire physical universe .
it &apos;s what i do .
you know , the pishkin @-@ wolowitz
liquid waste disposal system
is turning a few heads as well .
again , ew .
you know , i &apos;d love to hear more
about how you intend to add neutrinos .
could we get a cup of coffee sometime ?
i don &apos;t drink coffee .
i do . i love me a cup of joe .
well , it doesn &apos;t have to be coffee .
how about dinner ?
i do eat dinner .
great . i know a terrific little italian place .
i never eat in strange restaurants .
one runs the risk of non @-@ standard cutlery .
excuse me ?
sheldon lives in fear of the three @-@ tined fork .
three tines is not a fork .
three tines is a trident .
forks are for eating ,
tridents are for ruling the seven seas .
what if i brought food to your place ?
that would be acceptable .
on mondays , i eat thai food .
mee krob and chicken sate
with extra peanut sauce from siam palace .
you got it .
i already have your address .
what a nice girl .
sheldon , do you have any idea what just happened ?
yes. apparently i &apos;m getting a free dinner .
oh , yeah , no , this thing &apos;s majorly out of order .
see ?
sorry .
that &apos;s okay .
guess i &apos;m taking the stairs .
where you going ?
4 @-@ a .
oh , are you here to see leonard ?
no , dr. cooper .
dr. sheldon cooper ?
we &apos;re having dinner .
sheldon cooper ?
tall , thin ,
looks a little like a giant praying mantis ?
he is cute , isn &apos;t he ?
sheldon cooper ?
hi , leonard .
hey , ramona. come on in .
thanks. where should i put this ?
uh , the kitchen &apos;s fine .
hey , what are you doing ?
i need to see this. uh @-@ huh .
the viewing area &apos;s right over there .
sheldon , your girl ... date ... person ... ramona &apos;s here .
oh , hello .
oh , sorry i &apos;m late .
i just got so caught up reading the draft of your latest paper .
did you enjoy the humorous footnote
where i illustrate mirror @-@ symmetry
by likening it to the flash playing tennis with himself ?
so funny .
but the idea that you might be able to incorporate gravity ,
i have to tell you , i found it physically exhilarating .
my hypotheses tend to have that effect .
i &apos;m sorry i didn &apos;t bring enough for your friends .
i assumed we were going to be alone .
no , we were just going .
to watch , right ?
no , come on , now , we &apos;re going out .
oh , come on , we &apos;ll be quiet .
let &apos;s go , let &apos;s go .
okay , you two .
have a nice ...
whatever this is .
okay , you guys , look ,
i know this is none of my business ,
but i just ... i have to ask--
what &apos;s sheldon &apos;s deal ?
what do you mean &quot; deal &quot; ?
you know , like what &apos;s his deal ?
is it girls ... ? guys ... ? sock puppets ... ?
honestly , we &apos;ve been operating under the assumption
that he has no deal .
come on , everybody has a deal .
not sheldon .
over the years , we &apos;ve formulated many theories
about how he might reproduce .
i &apos;m an advocate of mitosis .
i &apos;m sorry ?
i believe one day sheldon will eat an enormous amount
of thai food and split into two sheldons .
on the other hand , i think sheldon
might be the larval form of his species ,
and someday he &apos;ll spin a cocoon and emerge two months later
with moth wings and an exoskeleton .
okay , well , thanks for the nightmares .
hey , do you want to hang out with us ?
what are you guys gonna do ?
my mom &apos;s making a brisket tonight .
the one with the little onions ? mm ...
yeah , i &apos;m busy , so ...
good night .
her loss. let &apos;s go .
brisket party !
b @-@ to @-@ the @-@ r @-@ to @-@ the @-@ i @-@ s @-@ k ...
to @-@ the @-@ e @-@ to @-@ the @-@ t ...
hey , aren &apos;t you having breakfast ?
yes .
are you experimenting with nutritional suppositories again ?
not in these pants .
so ... how &apos;d it go with ramona last night ?
oh , great .
she &apos;s smart , insightful
and she has a very unique way of , you know , revering me .
here &apos;s your spinach mushroom omelet .
thank you .
did anyone touch it ?
gloves were worn by everyone involved .
i was vigilant .
ramona pointed out that i &apos;ve been wasting 20 minutes a day
standing on cafeteria lines .
time which would be better spent
tackling the great physics problems of our day .
you don &apos;t tackle the big issues , ramona .
you fence with them .
en garde. riposte .
touche .
morning .
hi , leslie .
so , sheldon ,
i see you &apos;re organizing your papers
for the smithsonian museum of dumbassery .
there won &apos;t be any room
until they get rid of the permanent leslie winkle exhibit .
oh , good one .
i see you got a grad student to fight your battles for you .
i &apos;ll let you keep your lunch money today .
okay , dr. cooper is on the verge of a breakthrough .
if you &apos;re going to stay ,
you &apos;ll have to be respectful and quiet .
wait for me .
so have you worked out the neutrino issue ?
well , to paraphrase mozart ,
all the subatomic particles are there .
i just have to put them in the right order .
you &apos;re so witty .
aren &apos;t i ?
hey , guys , this package came for ...
dr. cooper is working .
yes , i &apos;m close to a breakthrough .
ooh , it tickles !
sorry .
holy crap on a cracker .
hey , penny .
hi. you probably don &apos;t want to go in there .
why ? what are they doing ?
the only way i could explain it
would be in a therapist &apos;s office with dolls .
hoo @-@ boy .
dr. cooper &apos;s working .
yeah , i can see that .
sheldon , halo night , koothrappali &apos;s. you coming ?
oh , yes , it &apos;s halo night .
let me just dry my tootsies .
you &apos;re not going to halo night .
yes , i am .
it &apos;s wednesday. wednesday &apos;s halo night .
didn &apos;t a great man once say , &quot; science demands nothing less
&quot; than the fervent and unconditional dedication
of our entire lives &quot; ?
he did .
and who was that great man ?
me .
sorry , leonard .
seriously ? you &apos;re not coming ?
you heard her. how can i argue with me ?
okay , well , once again , you guys have a good ...
whatever this is .
dr. cooper , i have to tell you
your friends are holding you back .
i prefer to think of it as &quot; i &apos;m pulling them forward . &quot;
halo night ?
a man with your intellectual gifts
doesn &apos;t waste an evening playing video games .
he does on wednesdays .
not if he wants a nobel prize .
he does want that .
does a man with my intellectual gifts
play paintball on weekends ?
what do you think ?
drat .
now shall we get back to work ?
i suppose .
battlestar galactica comes on tonight .
i guess i can wait for the dvd .
and then never ever watch it .
penny ! penny !
penny !
sheldon , honey , i &apos;ve told you ,
it &apos;s a small apartment .
you only have to knock one time .
please , please , i don &apos;t have a lot of time .
look , ramona finally dozed off ,
and i need you to help me get rid of her .
get rid of her how ?
i don &apos;t know ,
but apparently i &apos;m in some kind of relationship ,
and you seem to be an expert at ending them .
excuse me ?
i see man after man leaving this apartment never to return .
okay , first of all , it is not man after man .
dr. cooper ? ! hide me .
hide you ?
i formally request sanctuary .
why aren &apos;t you working ?
she distracted me .
i told you , penny , i don &apos;t have time for your nonsense .
i have important things to do .
oh , man .
i know what &apos;s going on here .
really ?
well , then will you explain it to me ?
you &apos;re in love with dr. cooper .
uh , yeah , no , that &apos;s not it .
don &apos;t try to deny it .
he &apos;s a remarkable man ,
but you have to let him go .
oh , gee , okay .
i know it &apos;s hard , but he &apos;s a gift to the whole world ,
and we can &apos;t be selfish .
yeah , he &apos;s a gift all right .
sisters ?
uh , sure .
sisters .
holy crap on a cracker .
sheldon ?
what are you doing ? !
it &apos;s morse code .
why ?
so we can communicate through the wall .
we are communicating through the wall .
yes , but the communication is not encrypted .
i don &apos;t know morse code .
it &apos;s very simple .
this is a ...
this is b ... this is c ...
sheldon , i &apos;m not going to learn morse code
at 3 : 00 in the morning !
all right .
don &apos;t come in here , don &apos;t come in here , don &apos;t come in here ,
don &apos;t ... oh !
what &apos;s going on ?
shh ! ramona &apos;s sleeping on the couch .
i know. when is she going home ?
never. that &apos;s the problem .
i need your help .
what are you talking about ?
i &apos;m invoking the skynet clause of our friendship agreement .
that only applies if you need me
to help you destroy an artificial intelligence
you &apos;ve created that &apos;s taking over the earth .
come on ! don &apos;t nitpick !
good night .
shh. all right .
i &apos;m invoking our body snatchers clause .
the body snatchers clause requires me
to help you destroy someone we know
who &apos;s been replaced with an alien pod .
yes. she &apos;s in the living room. go .
i &apos;ll wait here .
sheldon , what are you doing out of bed ?
now ! do it !
you know you need your sleep
in order for your cognitive processing
to perform at optimum levels. now come on .
godzilla clause ?
not unless she destroys tokyo .
rats .
i &apos;ve got it !
i finally reconciled
the black hole information paradox
with my theory of string @-@ network condensates !
it &apos;s unbelievable !
it &apos;s paradigm @-@ altering .
and i could not have done it without you .
oh , please , i just offered a little encouragement .
it was a lot more than that .
you helped me work out the masses of all the fermions
and you pumiced my hammer toe .
how can i ever repay you ?
well , would you consider naming it the cooper @-@ nowitzki theorem ?
who &apos;s nowitzki ?
i &apos;m nowitzki .
oh , you want me to share credit ?
uh @-@ huh .
get out !
oh , hey , hi .
oh , bite me !
sisters ?
excuse me , dr. cooper .
i &apos;m kathy o &apos;brien .
i just finished reading your paper
reconciling the black hole information paradox
with your theory of string- network condensates ,
and it just took my breath away .
maybe when i publish it , i &apos;ll include an inhaler .
would you possibly have any time for me to pick your brain ?
let &apos;s see. today &apos;s thursday .
thursday nights , i eat pizza from giacomo &apos;s .
sausage , mushrooms , light olives .
great . i &apos;ll bring it to your place .
i have the address .
what a nice girl .
sheldon , do you see what just happened here ?
yes , i &apos;m getting a free pizza .
i &apos;m on a roll .
more pad thai , please .
sheldon , you &apos;ve already had four servings .
you might want to slow down a bit , buddy .
just one more bite .
sheldon ?
sheldon , are you okay ?
i &apos;m just so ... full .
