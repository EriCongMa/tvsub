For over a century, I have lived in secret until now.
I know the risk but I have to know her.
Elena, she's a dead ringer for Katherine.
Why do I look like her?
You are adopted.
This girl showed up, 16
and about to give brith.
What else do you know about her?
Just her name, Isobel.
My wife Isabel spent her life researching
paranormal activity in this area.
Where is your wife?
Damon killed her.
There is a tomb underneath the church.
The spell sealed Katherine in that tomb, protecting her.
I am gonna bring her back.
She's not here.
You knew Katherine isn't in there.
She knew where you were, she did't care.
Jesus, you scared me.
Do you know what day it is?
Saturday.
And what year?
It's 2010.
You Ok?
Thank you.
Wait, what's your name?
It's Harper, sir.
How did you get out here?
And why are you dressed like that?
You seem like a very nice person.
I'm sorry.
Sorry for waht?
阿橙 紫尾猫 小鹏有 内丘 默默
Hey, Bonnie, it's me just checking in,
seeing how you're doing.
We miss you here.
Don't let your aunt drive you too crazy.
Come home soon.
Love you.
What are you doin' out here?
It's cold.
Thinking, writing.
The, uh, funeral for Bonnie's grandma,
brought back a lot of mum and dad.
I was wondering you said you were doing
dome digging about them,
the adoption.
Right.
So did you dig?
Come on inside.
Your dad kept everything from his medical practice--
Records, logs, old appointment books.
I found an entry from the night you born
Patient and a birth date.
Isobel Peterson.
Do you think that's her real name?
Pregnant teenage runaway?
Probably not. First name, maybe.
But where'd she get peterson?
Classmate? Best friend?
So I binged it.
I searched for all the Petersons in this area
Born the same year as Isobel, found 3--
2 men and a woman, Trudie,
Who lived in Grove Hill, Virginia.
That's not far from here.
Well, watch this.
Isobel.
She was a cheerleader.
Trudie still lives there.
This is her address.
What about Isobel?
I couldn't find angthing about her.
Listen. There's something else.
Mr. Saltzman, Rick,
His wife was from around here,
And her name was also Isobel.
wait
"was" as an..
She died.
Alaric's wife might have been your mother?
It can't be true, right?
I mean, the coincidence alone is just crazy.
I have the address for her friend Trudie.
You wanna talk to her?
I--I don't know, I...
I--I don't know.
If it's true and they are the same person,
That means that my birth mother is dead,
And I don't know if I could handle that.
Elena, did Jenna tell you anything about Alaric's wife?
How she died?
just she was killed and case was never solved
You knew that already?
The night at the school when he attacked me,
He told me some things about her death.
Well--
no, no.
It's not possible.
The coincidence is-- it's too much.
Now, listen, if you do decide to go
Talk to Isobel's friend,
I'll go with you. Ok?
I just don't know how gonna do yet
I should get goin'.
I gotta go deal with Damon.
How's he doing?
He's dealing in his own way.
How do I taste?
Oh, so much better than your friends.
But shh. Don't tell them.
They might get jealous.
No. Buzzkill bob.
Greetings
Can we talk?
Yeah.
Without the tri-delts.
Anything you have to say to me,
You can say in front of them.
They're really good at keeping secrets.
You're worried about me.
That's nice. Don't be.
There's no need. I'm fine. Why wouldn't I be?
It's almost 145 years of one goal get in that tomb.
I succeeded.
Granted, Katherine wasn't in there to be rescued,
But why dwell?
No, it's so liberating not having a master plan,
Because I can do whatever the hell I want.
That's kind of what I'm afraid of.
Relax. I haven't killed anyone in-- too long.
those girls
end up their dorm with headaches,
Think they blacked out.
Business as usual.
Predictable you didn't
pull me over here for a pep talk.
So drink up. Spill it, brother.
There was a woman you may have known a few years back
named Isobel,
most came round here from Duke
you wanna discuss the woman in my past
Seriously
You killed her.
What's your point?
I just--just wanna know
if you remember anything about her.
Oh, it's like a needle in a haystack, Stefan.
Well, think hard. It's important.
Nothing is important, not anymore.
great job
I have to go
and exploit some women in the name of grief
Which I'm sure you understand.
"Ttfn," Said the tri-delt. Heh.
What?
This is boring. I'm bored.
but we have this entire house to ourselves
I mean, it's practically a bachelor pad.
And...
So shouldn't we do something
A little bit more bachelor-paddy?
What? Something like this?
Something like that
I don't know.
This is a pretty good show.
Seriously?
Oh God
not on my couch.
Mom.
Hey.
I don't know. It's just weird, you know,
me being raffled off like a Disney cruise.
In this town,
Fundraising is like indentured servitude.
You don't have a choice.
Besides, you are bachelor and you are eligible
so there you go
With this.
Oh, god. I can't believe I'm gonna do this.
what
I am totally gonna ruin this moment
but I have to tell you
Elena recently found out she was adopted,
And she's been looking for her birth mother...
Whose name was Isobel.
Isobel? Like my wife?
Isobel never had a baby.
Are you sure?
Not before you were together?
Nope. No way.
This is Elena's birth mother.
Ah, she, uh--
She never told me.
I gonna go.
Trudie?
Tru-trudie peterson?
Yes.
Uh, my name is Elena Gilbert.
I wanted to talk to you about Isobel Flemming.
Well, I haven't heard that name in years.
How do you know her?
I think that, um, well...
Do you know she had a baby
that she gave up for adoption.
My god.
You're her daughter.
I was just gonna make some tea. Would you like some?
Sure.
Uh, the kitchen's this way.
I wasn't gonna come. I didn't think I was,
But I was driving, and I hit this stoplight,
And it made me think about when I was learning
How to drive and then my mom would always warn me
About this blind turn on the left-hand side,
And then I was thinking about my mom, and--
I have your address,
I'm sorry for barging in
It's no problem.
Um, just a surprise, though.
I haven't thought about Isobel in years.
When was the last time you saw her?
About 17 years ago,
when she left to go have you.
We kept in touch for a while,
But, well, you know, people drift apart.
And you don't know where she ended up?
She was in Florida for a while.
She was on her own, you know, she wasn't easy.
Do you have any idea who my father is?
I could never get her to fess up.
Anyway, she finally pulled it together,
got into college on a scholarship.
Where did she go?
Somewhere in Carolina. Duke, I think.
Smart girl, smart school.
Let me just grab that.
So it's been a few month, where have you been?
Well, here and there. Never one place too long.
You know Pete.
No, actually, I don't,
because you never brought him around.
So blonde's the new flavor of the month, huh?
So sorry I scared her off.
She's not a flavor, mom. I like her.
So she's the one?
No, probably not, but maybe.
Matt, seriously,
Liz Forbes's daughter.
Mom, seriously. Knock it off.
Ice, please.
So, uh, you heard from Vic?
No, but don't worry.
She will come home eventually when she needs something.
I played that game.
Are you playing it now?
No. Then what are you doin' home?
You trying to say I need a reason to come back?
Sit down. Eat with me.
Tell me everything I've missed, hmm.
Thanks for meeting me.
Something's come up.
Jenna told you.
Yeah.
So it's true.
Your wife Isobel was Elena's birth mother.
What does Elena know?
About your wife?
About everything. About you, your brother.
She knows what I am,
and she knows that you know about the vampires.
Does she know about Damon and Isobel?
No. I couldn't tell her until I was sure.
You said you'd help me.
I asked Damon without saying too much.
He doesn't remember.
Ask him again.
Damon is not stable right now.
You know, he murdered my wife
Or at the very least made a meal out of her.
When has he been stable?
I'm telling you not to push this.
Give me a reason not to.
Your survival. How's that for a reason?
I'll handle it, but for now, I need you to let it go.
Is what you tell Elena?
Let it go?
Leave Elena out of this.
I need to know what happened.
I think you would, too.
I need something more than just your wife's
name pictures about everthing of Damon.
Just a few more minutes.
Can't you, uh--
Can't you fix it at morning
I like working in night.
Yes I like sleeping in night. With you.
Ok, I'll bite.
What is it, thesis stuff?
Look, baby, I'm in a 3-way here with you and your computer,
The least you can do is let me know what you're up to.
I was doing research,
And I dug up all this stuff
About this small town in Virginia near where I grew up.
It's isolated, out of the way, and quiet,
And every now and then, people die mysteriously,
And they say that it's animal attacks.
Except, these bodies are drained of blood.
It's vampires and it has to be.
I'll get my garlic and holy water,
And then maybe, just maybe...
No.
We can get some sleep.
Come here.
No.
Look, this is why I love you,
Because you believe in all of this stuff,
So much so that you're making a degree out of it.
you're like Mulder except hotter than a girl
This is not a joke, Rick.
You think that this is cute,
But I'm gonna prove it.
And Mulder was right in the end.
They came to the game for us.
The football team hadn't won in years.
We were the stars.
Well, Izzie was.
But I was a damn good backup.
Heh. This is great. Thank you.
You're welcome.
You haven't touched your tea.
What is this?
Oh, it's just some herbal mixture
Vervain?
You know.
Know what?
You didn't invite me in,
And you're serving vervain tea.
You know.
I think that you should probably leave.
Wait. What are you not telling me?
Please, leave
Now.
Bourbon.
Behold, the teacher
dancing, paper degree?
It's, uh, more fun with a buzz.
Well, most things in life are.
Sober's depressing.
You don't strike me as somebody who gets depressed.
You say that like you know me.
Just a hunch.
You have a good afternoon.
Not likely.
Daytime drinking, huh?
It's all the rage.
Listen, I need a favor.
You ever been in love?
Excuse me?
Have you ever been so bent on someone,
That you just have your heart ripped out by them?
You forget I was married.
Right. Gay husband.
She'll have what I'm having.
Sit down.
There's a fundraiser here tonight
That the founder's council is throwing.
The town's most eligible bachelors get raffled off for dates,
And, well, we are short of bachelor.
As this what you doing, no one vampires
organize bachelor raffles?
Oh, trust me.
At this point, I miss the vampires.
Look, you're a hero to this town, Damon.
I know most people don't know it,
But you are, and you're single and a catch.
Oh, come on. Help me out.
Carol Lockwood won't let me live it down
if I come up empty handed
You know, a room for the woman
Clamoring want to win a date with me
Sounds tasty.
Thank you.
One thing.
Can you get information on someone for me?
Alaric Saltzman, the history teacher.
There's just something a little off about him,
And I just-- I just wanna make sure that the high school
Did their homework on this guy.
You got it.
Thanks
May I help you?
Thank you for the text.
You're welcome.
I didn't tell her anything.
I--I kept my promise.
The girl though, she knows something
At won't be a problem.
She won't get any closer to the truth.
Good.
So I'm done?
Yes. You're done.
No! I won't invite you in.
You can't come in!
I'm not a vampire, so, yes, I can.
I don't understand, I did what you told me.
I did my part!
And now I have to do mine.
Stephen
Me.
You look, um...
Dashing? Gorgeous?
Irresistible?
Wrecked.
You look wrecked.
No reason why.
Do you know that I am one
Of mystic falls' most eligible bachelors?
Huh.
Yep.
How are you doing?
Never better
What can I do for you?
I'm a barrel of favors today.
It's my newfound purpose-- how can I help people?
I'm just meeting Stefan. We're going to the fundraiser.
Help a guy out, will you?
Can't get this.
So I found out who my birth mother is.
Ecch. Who cares?
She left you.
She sucks.
Stephen, there you are
Uhh. I need a bigger jacket.
Wow. You know,
An occasional sorority girl might, um,
You know, help fill you out a little bit.
He's fine.
He is Damon
Maybe this hard is good for him
Or remind him has one even he doesn't to beat
Won't hold my breath.
So I went to see Trudie Peterson.
I know. I'm sorry. I didn't plan it.
How was it?
She has vervain.
She knows about vampire stuff,
Stephen,this can't be coincidence
It Isn't.
This is Alaric's wife.
This is her. This is isobel.
He gave this to you?
Everything he knows about vampires, he learned from her.
He believes that she was killed by one.
Oh, my god.
Listen, Elena, there's a lot
There is a lot about Isobel than Alaric can tell you,
I need you hold of
before you talk to him.
Why?
I know that it's a lot to ask of you,
But will you do that for me?
Tickets for the raffle are now on sale.
All proceeds benefit the annual founder's day celebration.
That's a good look for you.
Embarrass and comfortable?
That's the one
Hey, look. I'm, uh, sorry about earlier.
It was just kind of a...a shock.
Well, I'm sorry for dropping it on you,
but I felt like you should know.
No, I get it.
At some point,
maybe you and Elena could talk.
I'm sure she'd like to hear about Isobel,
what she was like.
Yeah.
Or not. No pressure.
I don't know if that's a...a great idea.
At least not...not for a while.
Where'd our girlfriend go?
She's on her way to the grill.
I, uh, wanted to talk to you.
This is the woman, Isobel. From north Carolina.
Remember or not?
Who wants to know?
I do.
Who else wants to know?
Did you kill her?
Sorry. Don't know her.
Hey, are you comin'?
The real housewives of mystic falls await.
He's already been hit on, like, 35 times.
He's total cougar bait.
Impressive.
Embarrassing
Hi,Mrs.Donovan
Hi, Elena honey.
Hi, Kelly.
Long time no see.
How are you doing?
Oh, same old.
Oh. Matty tells me you broke his heart.
Mom.
Just kidding.
Calm down.
He found his rebound girl
Oh. Here you go, sweetheart.
However many that'll buy.
I just hope I don't get bachelor 3.
I dated him in high school.
Not impressive.
In any way.
Very exciting.
I've got the big date planned.
It's a romantic dinner,
Secluded spot somewhere woodsy.
You're making me think I should buy a ticket
Well, you are in charge. You could always rig it.
Pardon me.
I ran the check on the history teacher.
You want this before or after your big debut?
How's it look?
He checks out.
Couple of speeding tickets.
It's a rough story, though.
Turns out his wife went missing a few years
back North Carolina
North Carolina?
She have a name?
Yeah. Isobel.
Isobel.
And what do you do, bachelor number 3?
Yeah, I'm a plumber.
Well, isn't that wonderful?
We could always use more plumbers.
Moving on.
Number 4, "Alaric saltzman."
Wow. That's quite a mouthful.
What do you do, alaric?
I'm a teacher at Mystic Falls high.
Oh, beauty and brains, ladies.
This one's a keeper.
what do you teach?
history.
History, oh ,get the fun fact
About Mystic Falls, something crazy.
He probably saving the best stories for his date.
And last, but not least,
Damon salvatore.
We don't have much on you.
Well, I'm tough to fit on a card.
Do you have any hobbies, like to travel?
Oh, yeah. L.A., new york.
Couple of years ago, I was in north carolina,
Near the duke campus, actually.
I think--I think alaric when to school there.
Didn't you, Rick?
Yeah, 'cause I-- I know your wife did.
I had a drink with her once,
she was a great girl, never tell you that?
cause she was--
She--
Delicious.
Are you ok?
I just need some air.
Elena
He killed her,
Damon was the vampire that killed her?
I don't know what happened.
Alaric said that they never found the body.
Oh, my god. Stefan.
I know. I'm sorry. I wanted to tell you,
But I just-- I wanted to know more.
I was feeling sorry for him,
Hoping that this whole Katherine thing would change him.
I'm so stupid.
He doesn't know about the connection to you.
I thought about confronting him.
But he is already so on edge.
Why are you protecting him?
Because you are not the only one hoping that he might actually change.
That man.
I saw that man outside of Trudie's.
Get back inside. Come on
And bachelor number 3 goes to 37458.
That's me.
Ah. Kelly Donovan. Lovely.
You and the plumber should have so much fun.
Congratulations, Ms. Donovan.
Ok. Just...stop.
Stop trying so hard.
This thing you're doing, this nice thing, it's fake,
like you, like your mom,
and for some reason, Matt fell for it,
but that doesn't mean that I will.
I don't like you, ok?
So tell plumber boy I'll be at the bar.
Whoa. Easy there.
Buy a ticket like everyone else.
Did you enjoy that,
rubbing it in to alaric saltzman?
What?
Just as I was starting to think that there
Was something redeemable about you.
Elena.
Am I missing something here?
Did I forget to mention earlier when we were talking
about my birth mother,
the one that gave me up?
Her name was Isobel.
Go ahead. Reminisce about how you killed her.
Let's get you home.
I have a message for you.
What?
Who are you?
Stop looking.
Stop looking for what?
She doesn't want to know you.
She doesn't want to talk to you.
Isobel.
You need to stop looking. Do you understand?
She's alive? Does that mean she's a...
Elena, he's under a compulsion.
Do you understand?
Yes. I do.
Good.
I'm done now.
Come on. Let's get out of here.
37649.
That's me.
Congratulations.
And bachelor number 5, Damon Salvatore.
37552.
What are the chances? Me.
Where'd he go?
I'm gonna call you later.
I think it's time to let this vampire crap go.
I mean, the research, the trips,
it's become an obsession.
This is important to me.
Why? Why is this so important?
Explain to me. I mean...make me understand.
I mean, what's the point of this?
You don't want kids. You're barely ever home.
I just want us to be normal people.
Maybe I don't want to.
Maybe I want more.
Here we go. Home, sweet home.
Wait. Why...why are we back here?
I wasn't ready to leave.
Yeah, you were, mom.
You're the best, Matty.
I know.
I'm...I'm sorry...
I was gone so long.
Why are you really home, mom?
It's Pete.
He's gone,
and it's all my fault.
I did it. I always do it.
No, you didn't, mom.
It's not your fault.
You're all I have left.
Please don't leave from me
I'm not goin' anywhere.
Are you really this stupid?
Guess so.
You gotta put down the stake.
Wow. That's courage.
Where's Isobel?
What have you done to my wife?
You want me to tell you I killed her?
Would that make you happy?
Because I think you know what happened.
I saw you feeding on her.
Yeah. I did, and I wasn't lying.
She was delicious.
Oh, come on. What do you think happened?
Not an inkling?
Never considered the possibility?
I turned her.
Why?
She came to me, all pathetic,
Looking for vampires.
There was something about her,
Something I liked.
There was something special.
I turned her because she begged me to.
Yeah. But you knew that, too, didn't you?
Hmm. I guess she wasn't happy at home,
Wasn't happy with life in general,
Wasn't happy with you.
Ah, this is a shame.
Unrequited love sucks.
Sounds like I got a lung.
We're kindred spirits,abandoned by the women we love.
What happened?
What did you do?
Dude, what? He attacked me.
Damon.
All I did was tell him the truth.
His wife didn't want him anymore.
It's not my fault he couldn't handle it.
Like you've been handling Katherine?
I'm handling it fine. You know what?
Isobel came to me.
She found me.
And if she's related to Elena,
That means she's related to Katherine.
Maybe katherine sent her to me.
Stop it. You don't have to keep looking.
Can't be a coincidence Isobel sought me out.
Mm-mmm. Can't.
I'm assuming you'll take care of this.
What happened?
What's going on?
You were just...
Did Damon turn you?
No. I--I went for him,
And then he, uh-- he stabbed me.
No, no, no.
You must have vampire blood in your system.
Somebody slipped it to you.
Then how?
I, uh...
Isobel.
Surprise gifts aren't fair.
I always feel bad for not getting you something.
Just open it.
Oh, that's a giant piece of jewelry.
Just tell people it's a family heirloom.
Nobody questions that.
Where'd you get this?
If I told you, you'd laugh at me.
But promise me that you'll always wear it.
It'll protect you from all the things that go bump in the night.
A ring to ward off the demons, eh?
Consider it a-- a token of my love,
My affection, and if nothing else,
An apology for being so crazy.
Well, you were definitely crazy.
I'm selfish, and I'm obsessed,
And I'm a horrible wife.
But you love me anyway.
Yes, I do.
This ring protected me.
That's impossible.
I know.
Was there a problem?
Did you find her?
What's going on?
Isobel?
Thanks.
It's harper.
I'm glad you found us.
Ms. Gibbons,
This gentleman is a friend of mine.
May he come in?
Any friend of Pearl's is a friend of mine.
Please do. Come in.
