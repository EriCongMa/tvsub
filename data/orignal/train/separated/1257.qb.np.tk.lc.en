level of decomposition suggests

sheesh . that &apos;s bad .
jane didn &apos;t have a choice .
paddy would have pulled the trigger on us .
you and i know that , but how would you feel if i shot your father ?
my father &apos;s not a mobster .
you having a hot flash ?
your cologne not working for you today ?
the medical community is debating if men go through menopause .
you could be experiencing a decrease in testosterone .
i got plenty of testosterone .
how about you , frost ?
love the smell of deco in the morning .
ooh , maggots like it , too . look here .
steam from the pipes has accelerated decomposition .
you know , few students know about these old tunnels .
2.1 / 4 miles of them run beneath the university .
they were constructed to house steam pipes ...
they should just apologize for whatever they said
to each other in that cat fight .
&quot; cat fight &quot; ? women hate that expression .
they do ?
damn ! so many new rules .
hey , janie , you got any more chips ?
can you believe the contract they gave this guy , huh ?
calls himself a pitcher .

look , look .
we see each other when i &apos;m in town , all right ?
when you &apos;re in town ?
you know , tommy &apos;s the only one
who never -- who never judged me .
well , tommy &apos;s always been so flexible
about what &apos;s right and wrong .
i don &apos;t want you bullying your baby brother .
that doesn &apos;t work anymore , pop .
talk , tommy .
i introduced him ... to lydia .
wait till you meet her .
you &apos;re divorced , so how do you plan
on having this big catholic wedding ?
yeah , the church kind of frowns on that .
just some paperwork i got to fill out .
what kind of paperwork ?
oh , my g--
you &apos;re gonna try to get an annulment , aren &apos;t you ?
janie , it &apos;s a piece of paper . it means nothing .
does ma know she didn &apos;t mean to have kids ?
look , i have no desire to hurt your mother , all right ?
she doesn &apos;t know , does she ?
you haven &apos;t even had the guts to tell her .
so , i guess that makes us all bastards .
hey . where you been ?
my father remembered he had a family and popped by .
wow . my dad &apos;s a dick , too .
no , i &apos;m busy feeling sorry for myself .
now i got to feel sorry for you , too ?
well , this &apos;ll cheer you up . we got a body .
rachel lawson , 25 .
grad student in earth and planetary sciences .
now i feel sorry for her , too . where &apos;s the body ?
it &apos;s down there .
how long she been there ?
looked like a couple of days , but you could ask --
relax , frost . i &apos;ll ask dr. isles .
victim rented a car . it &apos;s parked outside .
there &apos;s nothing in it .
here &apos;s the rental car agreement .
&quot; bcu campus car . &quot;
she was a v.i.p.
she rented a car every weekend for the last 20 weeks ?
yeah , it &apos;s a lot of mileage . see ?
maybe she was going home .
she &apos;s from boston .
she wasn &apos;t due to return the car until tomorrow .
well , where was she going , and why &apos;d she come back early ?
studies show that 5 % to 7 % of the male pop--
hello ... detective rizzoli .
hello , dr. isles .
well , i don &apos;t see any drag marks .
no . lividity confirms that she was killed here .
she &apos;s passed through rigor .
so she &apos;s been dead at least 36 hours .
she &apos;s in workout clothes . what was she doing down here ?
she was strangled .
thank you , doctor . i can see that .
looks like the weapon was a garrote .
garrote .
gee , i would love a history lesson on the ...
... garrote . wouldn &apos;t you , frost ?
well , it was most popular in the 17th century .
when it was used as a means of silent assassination
by the thuggee cult in india .
well , let &apos;s be on the lookout for the thuggees .
what are those red patches ?
urticaria .
urticaria ?
oh , uh , maybe you &apos;ll know what this means .
the yucky red stuff is a rash .
uh , thank you for clearing that up .
yes , that was a good explanation .
let &apos;s go .
you stay .
you have any idea what rachel was doing in the steam tunnels ?
steam tunnels ? what steam tunnels ?
you have any idea what this is ?
it was rachel &apos;s .
okay , let &apos;s take it with us .
uh , where &apos;s her bedroom ?
should i be worried ?
in horror movies ,
they always get the roommate next .
the campus is on high alert ,
and there are campus police outside your apartment .
you &apos;ll be safe .
and here i thought i missed out
on the whole &quot; roommate bonding &quot; thing .
oh , what a relief
&quot; cruelty free cotton . &quot;
i hate it when people are mean to cotton .
and vegan shoes . can you say &quot; vugly &quot; ?
says the woman who &apos;s been wearing the same boots
for the past two years .
oh , snap !
okay , rachel had a &quot; skinny &quot; section and a &quot; fat &quot; section .
how do you know about &quot; skinny @-@ fat &quot; clothes ?
i &apos;ve tried on all sizes .
oh , snap again ! whoa .
all right , what do we got here ?
loofah , aloe vera toothpaste ...
a crystal ...
that &apos;s a deodorant .
how do you know ?
told you -- all sizes .
oh , hello !
here &apos;s a sure way to keep the weight off .
cocaine .
why ? why would somebody do this ?
rachel was the kindest person .
did rachel mention any problems she was having ?
maybe with friends ?
no . she was there to study environmental geology .
she was very dedicated .
she worked very hard .
was she seeing anyone ?
no .
she wouldn &apos;t have talked to you about that .
mr. lawson , did you just come from a business trip ?
no . why ?
your watch is set to a different time than your wife &apos;s .
are you separated ?
yeah .
did you tell rachel ?
i told rachel i was leaving her mother ...
when i brought her back to school after winter break .
that &apos;s when she started going down into the tunnels , isn &apos;t it ?
we don &apos;t know why she was there .
why do you say that ?
rachel wasn &apos;t an only child . she had an older sister .
emily died when rachel was 7 .
rachel would go down into the basement .
she would sit there in the dark for hours .
when she was really suffering ,
she &apos;d find a place ...
it was my fault she was in those tunnels .
this may not be my place ...
but this beautiful girl loved you both very much .
honor her by being kind to each other .
you just pulled a midnight .
what , did you take another shift ?
all this stuff with pop ,
i &apos;d figured i &apos;d at least make some overtime .
you talk to maura yet ?
frankie , i don &apos;t think we &apos;re ever gonna be friends again .
we just keep making it worse .
okay . thank you . yes . okay .
dad hasn &apos;t told her ?
no .
i ran a check on her . on lydia .
frankie , you can &apos;t be doing that .
they watch stuff like that , all right ?
what &apos;d you find out ?
you don &apos;t want to hear it .
no , i don &apos;t . tell me everything .
she &apos;s 28 years old .
she &apos;s younger than us ! mm @-@ hmm .
hey , rizzoli .
you got a minute ?
yes , sir .
hey , frankie .
hey . lieutenant .
look , how we doing with that murdered bcu girl ?
i &apos;m getting a lot of heat from the brass .
parents are going nuts over there .
uh ... yes , uh , i haven &apos;t actually ... spoken to maura -- dr . isles ...
just sign it , and then everything is fine .
... in ... i just want an annulment .
are you okay , rizzoli ? is everything all right ?
... this piece of paper right now .
just do me that favor . okay ?
sure . sure , i &apos;ll sign it .
good .
over your dead body !
all these years i had to put up with your snoring !
my snoring ? !
what about your creams and your -- and your flossing ?
in the bed , you flossed !
that &apos;s right ! right .
in our marriage bed , where we made three children !
ma , come on .
that &apos;s right , and you still treat them like kids .
okay , move on , angela !
frank , come on . this isn &apos;t the time or place .
let &apos;s take it outside .
this is not your business . i &apos;m talking to my wife .
your ex @-@ wife .
thank god .
i will not dishonor our children !
i won &apos;t do it !
angela !
i idolized you . you know that ?
janie ...

you need to go , pop .
ma ...
tommy ?
hey . maura .
how you doing ?
how &apos;d you get down here ?
oh , i got my ways .
tommy , this area is secure .
i &apos;m on the job .
murphy &apos;s funeral home needed more pick @-@ up guys .
guess your people are too busy with murders ,
so they hired me to pick up the ones that just croak .
well , great . congratulations .
so , listen , i , um ... i kind of need some advice .
from me ? sure . shoot .
well , you know my dad &apos;s back .
i heard about what happened at the caf ?
jane told you ?
uh , no . no . jane and i are ...
not so ,
close as -- as we used to be .
well , you know my dad &apos;s getting remarried , right ?
yeah , he told us today .
no wonder jane was so off .
well , i mean , it &apos;s kind of a good thing
that you and jane aren &apos;t talking .
oh , no , it &apos;s not . it &apos;s awful .
well , i just mean , you know , now that you &apos;re not talking ,
maybe we could
tommy .
what ? a guy &apos;s got to dream , right ?
advice . you said you needed advice .
right . i &apos;m gonna tell you something ,
but you can &apos;t tell anyone .
i &apos;m a vault .
i , uh ...
i kind of ... know ...
my dad &apos;s fiancee .
&quot; know . &quot;
as in the biblical sense ?
yeah . that sense .
i @-@ i mean , i only &quot; knew &quot; her one time ,
but that &apos;s just still wrong , right ?
i mean , do you think i should tell my dad ?
lower extremities are well @-@ muscularized ,
no evidence of trauma .
results are in on the white powder .
what , from the victim &apos;s apartment ? was it cocaine ?
negative for cocaine .
well , what was it ?
heroin ? crystal meth ? ketamine ?
sodium . bicarbonate .
tricky . baking soda .
thank you , susie .
uh , you &apos;re welcome .
nice work , senior criminalist chang .
nice work , chief medical examiner maura .
well , that explains why rachel had white powder
in her shower caddy .
&quot; caddy &quot; ?
livor mortis is indiscernible .
okay . i &apos;m sorry .
please explain to me why she had baking soda in her caddy .
you were just being nice because you want information .
she used it to wash her hair .
it &apos;s less toxic to the environment than shampoo .
well , that &apos;s commitment .
she &apos;s really fit , yeah ?
she &apos;s had anterior dislocations
to both her left and right humerus bones .
i &apos;d love to know why that &apos;s relevant .
it &apos;s too bad you don &apos;t guess .
well , you &apos;re in luck . it &apos;s national guessing day .
are you celebrating ?
i am .
she has these injuries because of repeated
chaturanga dandasana to urdhva mukkha svanasana .
i know what that is -- yoga .
are you breaking out in hives from the guessing ?
not yet .
and her rash is the result of &quot; defatting , &quot;
the chemical dissolution of dermal lipids .
what &apos;s that in &quot; yucky rash &quot; lingo ?
she was submerged in icky stuff .
oh , submerged , great .
so the vegan girl is bathing in chemicals
great .
jane .
what ? i thought we were done .
okay .
rachel was not snorting coke .
what was she doing with it ?
washing her hair .
that &apos;s expensive shampoo . you --
jane .
it was baking soda , all right , frost ?
so why was she in the tunnels ,
who was in there , and why did they kill her ?
uh , jane , you should ,
did you check her financials ?
she owed bcu 27 grand , which --
which is weird , because
it was all covered with student loans and grants .
so what &apos;d she do with all that money ?
i &apos;ll get a subpoena for her bank records .
yeah , we got to figure out what this is .
oh ! nice t.p. tail .
what ?
why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
tell you what ?
we didn &apos;t even notice .
yeah , right . they can see it from across the street .
god , can this day get any worse ? !
sorry .
find the symbols on rachel &apos;s tile .
there it is .
it &apos;s trademarkd .
&quot; sensei matta yoga . &quot;
rachel &apos;s bank shows automatic
monthly payments to the same place .
she spent $ 25,000 on yoga ?
in five months ?
enlightenment is expensive .
owner &apos;s name is ... sensei matta .
well , that &apos;s not the name his mother gave him .
yoga studio is nearby . come on , let &apos;s go talk to him .
he went to a lot of trouble to hide his identity .
maybe we keep it on the down low
so we don &apos;t spook him ?
stop !
frost , track his business records ,
find out what his real name is .
come on , korsak . let &apos;s go do some yoga .
crap .
what ?
floater just beached himself
on the north bank of the charles .
man , you &apos;re lucky .
it &apos;s probably a suicide . you &apos;ll make detective .
yeah , when i &apos;m 104 .
come with me .
really ?
yeah , come on .
would you pay 25 grand to look like that ?
i &apos;d rather drink my six @-@ pack .
have a boston whaler with a tuna tower .
welcome . love and light .
oh , i &apos;m sorry , this is a caffeine @-@ free zone .
uh , i &apos;m -- i &apos;m sorry . we had no idea .
oh , that goes in composting .
the middle one .
it &apos;s so wonderful when couples come in together .
oh , we &apos;re not a --
accustomed to ... such a nice yoga studio .
yoga is an excellent way
to keep up with the demands of a young wife .
and i &apos;m very demanding .
whew , you sure are ... babe .
i teach a beginners &apos; class in a few minutes .
you &apos;ll take it .
oh , no , no , no . no .
we &apos;re not dressed for yoga .
actually , we would like to meet sensei matta .
nobody meets the master until after class .
you have anything a little less ...
stretchy ?
his eyes and his tongue are gone .
that &apos;s from fish activity , right ?
looks different in the books .
he &apos;s got boobs .
it &apos;s from the bloating .
he &apos;s been in the water a ... a while .
hey . look at his forehead .
you think that &apos;s fish activity ?
it could be blunt force trauma .
so it might not be a suicide .
right ?
hey , hey , hey . come here . grab his arm .
we can pull him out ourselves , right ?
i &apos;ll get him .
tommy . what are you doing here ?
working . what ?
you think you and jane are the only rizzolis
that can look death in the face ? move .
all right .
how about you ?
can you look death in the face ?
and as we easily hold our balance ,
take your gaze to the ceiling and breathe .
with your right hand flat on the floor ,
take that left arm and extend it to the ceiling
and reach .
as we move from half @-@ moon ardha chapasana ,
into an easy variation king dancer ...
if it &apos;s so easy ,
why doesn &apos;t she come up with something harder ?
i &apos;m scared .
can you please stay on your own mat ?
if you can &apos;t do this simple pose ,
just do adho mukha svanasana .
i &apos;d like to adho mukha svanasana her .
i &apos;ll help .
apparent skull fracture .
holy crap , it &apos;s my first murder .
stop right there !
i can &apos;t take it . i can &apos;t do it .
what ? w @-@ what &apos;d i say ?
this man might have hit his head when he jumped .
or slammed into rocks when his bungie cord snapped .
for all i know ,
wile e. coyote dropped an anvil on his head .
it was just a gut feeling . i --
this is a scientific process .
do you understand , officer ?
you do not guess , leap to conclusions ,
speculate , theorize , wonder ,
or tell me about your gut .
am i clear ?
yeah . clear .
i hope you experienced
a little bit of love and light transformation .
words cannot begin to express .
yeah , we &apos;re so transformed ,
we &apos;re ready to meet sensei matta .
he rarely leaves his spiritual retreat
in western massachusetts .
but you said after --
it &apos;s a ways , but it might be worth it .
what &apos;s the address ?
you can &apos;t know that until you ascend .
that girl , hon -- what was her name ? rachel ... ?
oh , rachel lawson ,
the one that told us about this place .
that &apos;s the one , yes .
she said she &apos;d been to the retreat .
rachel ascended very quickly .
huh . must be flexible .
sensei matta believes rachel is , uh ...
spiritually gifted .
i &apos;ll get you packets to fill out .
now that you &apos;re ready to ascend ,
you &apos;ll put a credit card on file .
rachel &apos;s parents said she didn &apos;t have a boyfriend .
yeah . but they didn &apos;t know
she was &quot; spiritually gifted , &quot; either .
i got a bad feeling .
me too .
anything ?
yeah . a lot .
got a name -- matthew moore .
that &apos;s your sensei matta .
well , how are we gonna find his retreat
in all of western mass ?
what are these shaded areas ?
i &apos;ve been busy .
sensei matta yoga bought 20,000 acres there ,
all within the last year .
it &apos;s all protected land . how ?
using their nonprofit religious exemption .
ohh , now i really have a bad feeling .
i &apos;v also been through all of bcu &apos;s security footage
of tunnel entrances .
rachel started going in five months ago .
right after her parents separated .
then she stopped for months .
started going again two weeks ago .
i want to know what happened two weeks ago .
me too .
last time was three days ago ,
the day she was murdered . no one followed her .
there &apos;s a lot of tunnel entrances in campus buildings .
somebody was in there .
the victim &apos;s rash was caused by benzene and 1,4 @-@ dioxane ,
likely from a fresh water source .
i &apos;ve narrowed it down to seven lakes in western massachusetts .
are you saying those lakes are polluted ?
i &apos;m not . the ph levels and mineral content are .
swell . my sprout troop used to
have sleepover camps at one of those lakes .
you were a sprout trooper ?
yes . why is that so hard to believe ?
you mean because it is your
&quot; duty as a sprout trooper
to be kind , friendly , generous &quot; ?
i was so sweet and kind ,
i won &quot; sweetest camper . &quot;
two years in a row .
so , ha ha ha .
was anyone else there ?
to watch you ... accept your award ?
nice recovery .
the pollution must be recent because it &apos;s not showing up
in any of the water quality reports .
bet you that &apos;s where rachel
was driving that campus car to .
well , it &apos;s a small needle in a big haystack .
i am going there and doing my own water quality testing .
hey ! dr. isles ...
since you &apos;re going anyway ,
would you get a statement from matthew moore ?
goes by the name of sensei matta .
oh ! you can &apos;t have a medical examiner
go get a statement from a suspect .
that &apos;s my job .
hey ! you two can go together .
i &apos;m sure she &apos;s taking a different road .
there &apos;s only one .
you &apos;re right . i am .
i have to go get a few things .
i &apos;ll tell cavanaugh .
swing and a miss .
ah . where &apos;s your car ?
hey , mo , it &apos;s korsak .
hey ! my car !
what are you doing to my car ? !
uh , my job .
i don &apos;t know how many times i &apos;ve told you about parking here .
i park here every day , mo .
oh , not today .
have a great rest of your day , all right ?
i &apos;m gonna rent a car .
yeah , me too .
don &apos;t forget your lunch !
what is that ?
mortadella on foccacia bread ,
with a little roasted red pepper .
korsak put you up to this ?
all i &apos;m going through , and you two can &apos;t be civil ?
don &apos;t you dare pull the annulment card .
he wants me to sign a paper
that says i didn &apos;t want you kids !
ma , we &apos;re grown @-@ ups .
we know you wanted us .
if you &apos;re such a grown @-@ up ,
then act like one and stop this !
hey . just saw big mo towing your cars .
you want to borrow mine ?
oh , you &apos;re good .
one little thing for your mother ,
and you can &apos;t do it ?
it is more energy efficient if we take one car .
fine , but i &apos;m driving .
why do you get to drive ?
because it &apos;s an unmarked , and because i &apos;m a cop ,
and becau-- just get in the car , maura !
have a good time , girls .
i am not listening to led zeppelin .
i &apos;m not listening to yo @-@ yo ma .
i don &apos;t listen to yo @-@ yo ma ...
... in the car .
oh , that &apos;s right , pardon me .
yo @-@ yo ma &apos;s just for the jacuzzi .
put your seatbelt on !
it &apos;s on !
the next lake is 42.3910 degrees north .
longitude ? really ?
can you just tell me to &quot; turn left at popeye &apos;s chicken &quot; ?
there is no popeye &apos;s chicken in western massachusetts .
72.3830 west .
the acoustic vibrations of hard rock
have been shown to increase the risk of an accident .
did you pass gas ?
no , i did not !
okay .
hey , ma .
are you girls having fun ?
oh , yeah , we &apos;re great .
maura &apos;s having gastrointestinal issues .
i am not !
jane used to fart on long car rides
and blame her brothers .
did you just say &quot; fart &quot; ?
have you listened to the audiobook yet ?
it &apos;s in the cooler .
uh , &quot; what to do when your former best friend is a bitch &quot;
really ?
mm . too bad it &apos;s wet !
have fun . love you both .
bye , ma .
our charles river floater is paul mcnamara .
he was a professor at waltham university .
professor of hydrology . studied groundwater . hmm .
fracking is an
invasive way to extract natural gas .
proponents say it will liberate the u.s.
from dependence on foreign oil .
but my research indicates
it will destroy the environment .
750,000 views .
wow . popular professor .
mm . not everybody loved him . listen to this comment .
&quot; what does this idiot tree hugger
want us to put in our gas tanks ?
how about his blood ? &quot;
somebody killed him .
we don &apos;t know that , frankie .
you saw the front of his head .
oh , wait .
you -- you didn &apos;t , did you ?
remind me not to invite you to my next floater .
go straight past the coniferous spruce .
maybe i &apos;ll pass a hemlock , too .
oh , look . a homo sapien .
oh , crap . in a guard booth .
love and light .
love and light . you here for the retreat ?
yes .
okay , what &apos;s your name ?
oh , uh , our names may not be on your list .
we -- we just ascended . today , in fact .
oh . well , unless you have your double platinum soul certificate ,
i can only allow you go as far as the public picnic area .
ohh . well , we understand .
love and light .
love and light .
let &apos;s hope he doesn &apos;t run that .
there &apos;s the lake .
nothing gets pass you .
love and light .
hurry up .
okay . oh ! shoot !
we need to leave .
no , i need to talk to matthew moore .
no . listen to me . we &apos;re in danger .
those don &apos;t look like yogis .
what did you take a picture of ?
i &apos;ll tell you in the car .
please ! trust me .
rachel definitely swam in that lake .
and i know why it &apos;s so polluted .
i saw fracking equipment .
what is fracking ?
it &apos;s a controversial process to drill for natural gas .
they pump hundreds of chemicals thousands of feet underground .
it pollutes groundwater .
you &apos;ve got to be kidding me .
that &apos;s why we pulled a thelma and louise ?
well , jane , it &apos;s illegal here .
rachel was a geologist .
maybe sensei matta didn &apos;t bring her here to sleep with her .
maybe he brought her here to help .
yeah , but she wouldn &apos;t have helped .
her interest was in the environment .
exactly .
so maybe she saw what you saw ,
she uncovered the fracking , and that &apos;s what --
you okay ?
i @-@ i think so .
oh , crap .
my phone is wet .
what ? what ? can you move your leg ?
no , it &apos;s stuck .
okay .
get down ! get down ! get down !
maura , get out of the car .
get out of the car !
i can &apos;t get my leg out !
maura , get out of the car !
my leg is stuck !
maura , go !
run !
stay down . stay down .
go for the tree line . go ! go !
i got jane &apos;s voicemail again .
cell service is iffy , though .
maybe they &apos;re yelling so loud ,
they can &apos;t hear their phones .
what is that ?
looks like a partial impression of a shut @-@ off valve ,
a big one .
you only find equipment like this in boiler rooms .
i think your floater was in the tunnels .
where we found rachel &apos;s body ?
yeah , i think his head was smashed against
a shut @-@ off valve somewhere in the tunnels .
we might be looking at a double homicide .
so , how &apos;d he get in the river ?
there &apos;s an outflow of the tunnel
that dumps right into the charles .
look for a link beteen rachel lawson and paul mcnamara .
come on . we got to try to keep going . come on .
we haven &apos;t seen them in hours . i need to stop .
okay !
what ? what ? did you pull something ?
no .
take it off .
all right , all right .
oh , my god , maura .
your leg , i @-@ it &apos;s hard , and it &apos;s cold . it &apos;s like a dead body .
what that ?
it &apos;s compartment syndrome .
well , what does that mean ?
the post @-@ tibial artery must have ruptured in the crash .
but you &apos;ve been walking on it !
blood from the artery is leaking .
the pressure built .
and now the blood is trapped
in one of the lower compartments of my leg .
okay , bottom line it for me .
the blood supply to my lower leg has been compromised .
i &apos;ll lose my leg unless --
unless we get you to a hospital .
maura , come on !
no , unless you do a fasciotomy .
i need something sharp .
what ? no , maura , i --
maura , i &apos;m not gonna cut your leg off
with a nail file .
do you have sugar packets ?
no , why , did you bring coffee ?
i could use it to dress the wound .
do you still have your phone ?
yes . yes .
why didnit think of that ?
that &apos;s luck . we can call 911 .
oh , it &apos;s busted !
the touch screen is gorilla glass .
no , maura .
i &apos;m -- i &apos;m not gonna do this .
it &apos;ll work . okay .
you &apos;re gonna make a six @-@ inch incision right here .
and a five @-@ inch there .
okay , just try not to cut the superficial peroneal nerve .
no . i can &apos;t do this .
take off your shirt .
what ? okay , now i know you &apos;ve suffered a head injury .
and let &apos;s go . to bind the wound . okay , come on .
oh , god , maura . please -- please don &apos;t make me do this .
listen to me . listen to me .
you just keep on cutting , okay ,
till the blood starts to flow .
maura , i &apos;m sorry . i can &apos;t do this .
you &apos;re a sprout trooper ! okay ?
just -- once you make the double incision ,
you massage the wound like this .
okay , the blood will be black .
i can &apos;t . i can &apos;t . i &apos;m so sorry . i can &apos;t do this .
i &apos;m sorry .
i really like my leg , jane .

okay .
all right . all right . you ready ?
okay .
use more pressure . i &apos;m okay .
you &apos;re all right ?
i &apos;m not okay !
maura ?
maura ?
rachel was a phd candidate in geology at bcu ,
mcnamara is a professor of hydrology at waltham university .
too close to be a coincidence .
she didn &apos;t take any classes with him .
nope .
any e @-@ mail correspondence ?
no . no phone calls , text messages , nothing .
maybe she watched his &quot; fate of the earth &quot; talk .
searching rachel &apos;s browser history .
hold on .
there it is -- his &quot; fate of the earth &quot; talk .
so , she knew his work on fracking .
they were talking to each other .
i found a thread in the comments section
between mcnamara and &quot; rockrachel . &quot;
what &apos;s it say ?
&quot; i have evidence of fracking .
&quot; can you meet today in tunnels under geo building ? &quot;
that &apos;s two weeks ago .
looks like they met again ...
the day rachel was killed .
&quot; meet me . same place . 3 : 00 . bad news . &quot;
where the hell is jane ?
come on , maura , it &apos;s time to wake up .
i dreamt we were camping .
i voted for you .
can you turn the heat down ?
come on , we got to get you out of here .
you won sweetest camper again .
i didn &apos;t win .
my leg hurts . why -- why does my leg hurt ?
sensei matta , i presume ?
and you are officer ...
detective rizzoli .
detective ?
kind of stupid to drive a car
registered to the boston police out to my retreat .
don &apos;t you think , detective ?
get up . both of you .
my friend &apos;s hurt . she can &apos;t move .
get her off the ground .
let &apos;s go .
it &apos;s all right . it &apos;s all right .
what if their car crashed ?
try not to worry , ma . i &apos;m sure they &apos;re okay .
the state police would have called bpd ,
mrs. rizzoli .
all right , thanks .
that was my contact in army personnel records .
matthew moore is an ex @-@ army ranger .
he was a blackwater operative , too .
sounds like one badass yogi .
i don &apos;t like it . i &apos;m gonna take a ride up there .
take a ride ?
they could be at any one of those seven lakes .
i got to do something .
jane and dr. isles are out there .
how &apos;d you make the transition from yoga to fracking --
hard left at fraud ?
this land is full of black gold -- all from shale rock .
i just needed capital to tap its potential .
and a religion to hide behind ?
so you swindled vulnerable college students ?
i was already a martial arts master .
didn &apos;t take much to repackage what i knew and sell it .
you figured out that rachel was a brilliant geologist ,
and you brought her here to analyze your rocks for free ?
actually , she paid me for the privilege .
she was very obedient .
and she ... helped until she realized
that you were destroying this wilderness .
she stole shale samples from me ,
gave them to an environmental conspiracy crackpot .
i guess you could say we were at cross @-@ purposes .
i &apos;m a homicide detective .
every cop from here to boston will be looking for us .
too bad you can &apos;t look behind you .
you &apos;d have a nice view of the water when it comes through .
see , you &apos;re in a spillway for one of my reservoirs .
a few million gallons of water &apos;s gonna come pouring through here .
it &apos;s pretty toxic from all the fracking .
if i were you , i wouldn &apos;t drink it .
let &apos;s go .
come on !
come on !
try your phone .
i can &apos;t , maura .
it &apos;s busted , and it got wet .
call your mom . tell her we &apos;re friends again .
okeydokey .
hey , ma --
oh , crap , it works !
the microprocessor dried .
yay !
maybe just texting . wait .
crap . no . i @-@ i can only send symbols .
son of a ...
type 42 @-@ point ...
391 ...
0 ...
okay , thank you , maura .
it &apos;s morse code . nice job , maura .
what the hell ?
that view is not okay .
jane ? maura , you down there ?
korsak ? !

yeah .
we got to get maura out of here , all right ?
the spillway to the reservoir is open . hurry .

great job with the morse code .
the coordinates put me almost on top of you .
watch her leg ! watch her leg !
can you walk ?
uh , i can hop .

frankie , come help !
they &apos;re back from the hospital !
okay , i got her .

all right ?
yeah .
i spoke to korsak .
they got sensei matta and his guys .

yeah .
are you sure you &apos;re okay ?
yeah . let &apos;s get her some water .
so , i didn &apos;t tell my pop about knowing you @-@ know @-@ who .
i think that &apos;s wise .
you think i should tell my ma ?
no !
tommy , did you hurt her ?
no . no , no , he didn &apos;t .
my surgeon was very impressed with jane &apos;s incisions .
i always wanted a doctor in the family .
well , too bad . you got two cops and ...
an undertaker .
no , no , no . no . not doing that ever again .
i got three great kids .
i think you got a doctor , too .
thanks .
and thank you for saving my leg , jane .
i think you two should apologize to each other .
butt out .
butt out .
i &apos;m sorry if you are .
okay , but i &apos;m less sorry .
no , we were both jerks .
you were both assholes .
ma ! watch your language !
and ...
... i didn &apos;t really win &quot; sweetest camper &quot; award .
you didn &apos;t ?
i missed you .
