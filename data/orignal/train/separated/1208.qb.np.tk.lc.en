are you okay ?
hey , cowboy , where have you been ?
i think you &apos;ve had enough .
actually , you don &apos;t know what i think .
people are preparing for ali &apos;s return
and it &apos;s not with flowers and welcome home banners .
what are you saying ?
i &apos;m saying your friend hurt a lot of people ,
me included .
and i &apos;m not interested in continuing that ,
but i &apos;m also not going to out the people
who feel like they need to protect themselves .
maybe she &apos;s not coming .
oh , she &apos;s coming .
ali , do you know what your first class is ?
mom , what &apos;s going on ?
i &apos;m leaving your father .
caleb , when did you get back ?
i don &apos;t ever want to hear you say you &apos;re sorry again .
alison attacked me last night .
you &apos;re scared
because you know it &apos;s not gonna take me long
to win over your army of losers .
and you know i can do it again .
why wouldn &apos;t you just tell us the truth ?
it &apos;s not gonna fix this .
i &apos;ve called this press conference
because we received confirmation tonight
that the name of the victim
that was buried alive under dilaurentis &apos; property
was bethany young .
she was a 17 @-@ year @-@ old patient at the radley institution .
it &apos;s your house .
is anyone in there ?
toby !
想我了吗 贱人们 -a
it &apos;s from &quot; a. &quot;
what does it say ?
&quot; did you miss me , bitches ? &quot;
it can &apos;t be .
shana &apos;s dead .
where &apos;s toby ?
i don &apos;t know .
will you please call me later ?
okay . bye .
well , what did toby say ?
nobody was inside the house .
thank god .
yeah , but his dad did break his leg trying to avoid
a tree coming down .
it could &apos;ve been worse .
yeah . caleb &apos;s with them at the hospital .
guys , what does this mean ?
想我了吗 贱人们 -a
that we were wrong about shana ?
that &quot; a &apos;s &quot; alive and knows that i killed her .
that &apos;s impossible .
we all heard what shana said in that theater .
no , she never said that she was &quot; a. &quot;
she never used those words .
she had everything but the letter painted on her .
em , come on .
we got a text seconds after the house blew up .
either shana can cause explosions
from the grave or &quot; a &quot; is back .
or never left .
well , what are you saying ?
i think &quot; a &quot; took a nap and woke up tonight .
&quot; a &apos;s &quot; been here the whole time just watching us ,
waiting for the right moment to resurface .
but why now ?
that &apos;s what we have to figure out .
you look like you got as much sleep as i did .
i was with toby until an hour ago .
how is he ?
still pretty shaken .
i still don &apos;t get why &quot; a &quot; would blow up his house
when we were all just three doors down .
&quot; a &quot; doesn &apos;t shoot and miss .
there has to be a reason .
did you see this ?
wait , that &apos;s it ?
they &apos;re not gonna look into what caused the leak ?
the cops in this town should be riding around in clown cars .
i think you guys need to tell them who &apos;s behind this .
tell them what ?
we don &apos;t have a face or a name .
hanna , this isn &apos;t a game .
&quot; a &quot; blew up a house .
we can &apos;t .
it would unravel too much .
meaning ?
things happened while you were gone .
it &apos;s not the same as when you left .
i &apos;ve noticed .
caleb , i had no idea when you &apos;d come back
or if you &apos;d ever come back .
i won &apos;t be staying long .
i &apos;m thinking of going to montecito for a while .
i just assumed if you weren &apos;t in ravenswood
that you &apos;d be here .
i don &apos;t want to commit to anything .
well , um , it &apos;s late .
i should probably get to school .
shana wasn &apos;t &quot; a. &quot;
i killed an innocent person .
shana wasn &apos;t innocent , aria .
yeah , but the cops aren &apos;t gonna believe that
when they find out how long i &apos;ve been covering this up .
and it &apos;s only a matter of time before &quot; a &quot;
exposes what i did .
we don &apos;t know if this person has any idea about
what happened in new york .
what are you doing ?
looking for a connection .
a connection to what ?
between mrs. dilaurentis and bethany young .
why ?
i &apos;m starting to think i wasn &apos;t too far off
about my mrs. d theory .
mrs. d was on the board at radley sanitarium .
bethany was a patient there .
bethany was buried in her yard in the same spot
where ali was buried .
you think that &quot; a &quot; killed bethany and mrs. d ?
that would be a connection .
when i was writing my book ,
i interviewed some of the staff at radley
and i think the name bethany young came up .
i just don &apos;t know which file it &apos;s in .
okay , i can help you look after school .
we &apos;re gonna get through this .
i &apos;ll see you later .
dad .
i didn &apos;t see your car outside .
it &apos;s in the garage .
why aren &apos;t you at work ?
a little hard to concentrate
when your wife and daughter are living at a hotel .
i have class in 10 minutes .
spencer .
what the hell is going on ?
you have to discuss that with mom .
i would love to , but she won &apos;t return any of my calls .
we know that you lied about
where you and melissa were the night
that mrs. dilaurentis died .
how do you know that ?
what are you gonna do when the cops find out
that the pills that killed her are in your medicine cabinet ?
you think i did it ?
i know that you were just trying to protect me .
damn right , i &apos;ve been trying to protect you .
but i would never take a life to cover up
something you did .
i didn &apos;t do anything .
neither did i.
then where were you and melissa ?
wait , they drove to the lake to talk ?
yeah , that &apos;s what he said .
but he wouldn &apos;t say what they talked about
or why he lied .
have you talked to melissa ?
yeah , i &apos;ve left her like five message .
your mom did the right thing by leaving .
it &apos;s ezra .
i &apos;m with spencer .
okay .
yeah . well , thanks for checking in .
i &apos;ll see you later .
he &apos;s trying to find a link between bethany and mrs. d.
has he found one yet ?
no .
he &apos;s left messages for all his contacts at radley ,
but so far nothing .
and you &apos;re going over to ezra &apos;s place later ?
yeah . i &apos;m gonna help him sort through his files .
is that the only reason ?
is there something going on between you two ?
no .
then why did you bring him to emily &apos;s last night ?
okay , we had a slip .
a slip ?
well , technically , it was two slips .
oh , my god ! aria !
i thought you said that you were never gonna go there again .
i meant it when i said it .
are you forgetting about what he did to you ?
what he did to us ?
no , of course not .
you couldn &apos;t eat or sleep for weeks
after you found out about that book .
okay , well he took a bullet for us , spence .
yeah , but that doesn &apos;t change the fact
that he deceived you for years .
you okay ?
somebody dropped their lunch tray
and she practically jumped out of her skin .
so much for the new normal .
yeah , i knew it was too good to be true .
too good to be true ?
these last two weeks have been nothing but crap .
is toby still at the hospital ?
yeah .
he &apos;s there with jenna and her mom .
what &apos;s up with caleb ?
how long is he in town for ?
who knows ?
oh , my god .
what is it ?
oh , my god . ali .
&quot; i buried your mom the same way
i watched her bury you .
a. &quot;
&quot; a &quot; killed my mother .
who could it be ? mona ?
someone working with shana ?
yeah , or someone we haven &apos;t even thought of yet .
spence , are you okay ?
my dad didn &apos;t do it .
i accused him of murder , but he didn &apos;t do it .
well , it made sense why you thought he did .
unless your dad &apos;s &quot; a. &quot;
i &apos;m sorry , i &apos;m just putting it out there .
no , he can &apos;t be .
and he thought that i killed alison , now bethany .
that still doesn &apos;t rule out your sister .
some things never change
and now we &apos;re back to square one .
no , ezra thinks that bethany can ultimately lead us to &quot; a. &quot;
okay , then we have to try to help ezra find out
as much as we can about her .
aren &apos;t we stretching a little here ?
you have a better plan ?
i can &apos;t wait around for answers .
i need to leave town now .
but you just got back here .
the only reason i came back is
because i thought that &quot; a &quot; was dead .
if &quot; a &quot; wanted to kill you , why not just do it ?
why play games and blow up a house ?
i have no idea .
but i &apos;m not sticking around to find out .
but if you leave rosewood , then we can &apos;t protect you .
yeah , and besides , it &apos;s not like before , ali .
the cops are watching your every move .
the whole world knows you &apos;re alive .
even if you could run , where would you hide ?
this is absolutely ridiculous .
i am so disappointed in your lack of cooperation ,
but when you change your mind , there &apos;s my number .
think . give me a call .
okay ? we &apos;re out of here . let &apos;s go .
spencer . eddie . hi .
thank you for coming out .
i hope that i wasn &apos;t interrupting anything .
i have a few minutes .
great .
you look good . how are you doing ?
well ...
well enough to stay out of this place .
did you hear about the cavanaugh settlement ?
i &apos;m glad the family got some money .
they would &apos;ve preferred the truth .
heard about mrs. dilaurentis , too .
yeah .
i don &apos;t really think that it was a coincidence
that bethany young was found buried in her backyard .
do you ?
probably not .
did you know bethany well ?
if i did , i can &apos;t talk about it .
right . okay .
do you maybe want to go get coffee later ?
i can &apos;t talk about bethany or any other patient
not to the cops or reporters or you .
look , i know that you have a set of rules
that you have to stick to and i understand that ,
but somebody very close to me
might be framed for her murder .
so if you could just tell me anything at all ,
like if anybody from rosewood ever visited her or anything ,
it would be such a great help .
i wish i could .
eddie , you got a phone call .
good seeing you , spencer .
yeah .
i should never have come back here .
look , i get that you &apos;re scared , ali .
we all do .
that &apos;s why you &apos;re staying with me .
you can &apos;t just babysit me forever , hanna .
wait . don &apos;t just open it .
it &apos;s just travis .
i &apos;ll be in the kitchen .
hey you .
this is a nice surprise .
is it ? because we had plans to go to the grille at 7 : 00 .
i know you weren &apos;t drunk when we made them .
look , i &apos;m sorry .
with everything going on i totally spaced .
travis , i would go , but ali is in there
and i really don &apos;t want to leave her alone right now .
she &apos;s going through a tough time .
i saw mona &apos;s video .
looked like ali was the one making it tough .
don &apos;t believe everything that you see .
and about lucas &apos; party ,
i hope that i didn &apos;t do anything too embarrassing .
just on your phone all night trying to call someone .
i was ?
i don &apos;t remember that .
but i don &apos;t really remember anything
after the room started spinning .
figured there was somewhere else you wanted to be .
yeah , in bed with an ice @-@ pack .
so we &apos;re okay ?
yeah . great .
i &apos;ll call you when ali leaves .
okay .
later .
ali ?
i don &apos;t know .
just get there , okay ?
yeah , okay .
yeah . see you then .
who are you on the phone with ?
doesn &apos;t matter .
well , it sounded like you are making plans to go somewhere .
were you ?
alison .
i can &apos;t live in a world
where i jump every time the doorbell rings .
so what ? you &apos;re just gonna run away ?
please don &apos;t tell the girls or try to stop me .
what are you gonna do ?
say that you were kidnapped again ?
do you think i want to live like this ?
because i don &apos;t .
i &apos;d love to stay , hanna , but i can &apos;t .
not while that psychopath is still out there .
and don &apos;t worry , after i &apos;m gone ,
you can go back to focusing on your little love triangle .
ali , wait .
i &apos;ve made my decision , hanna .
so have i.
i &apos;m gonna help you .
nothing in this pile either .
okay .
that was a fun day .
look , ezra , what happened the other night ...
felt right , didn &apos;t it ?
it doesn &apos;t mean that things can go back to the way
that they were .
so what does it mean ?
i &apos;m not gonna pretend like i don &apos;t miss it ,
us , because i do .
i do , too .
yeah , but then i remember everything that happened
and how we met , all the lies that you told .
believe me , i wish i could go back and change things .
but you can &apos;t .
and the other night was a mistake .
evening , mr. fitz .
i &apos;m lieutenant tanner , state police .
mind if i ask you a few questions ?
sure , yeah .
this was outside your door .
great . thank you so much .
mind if i come in ?
sure . of course .
come in .
moving out ?
oh , no . just getting rid of some old school files .
so what can i help you with , lieutenant ?
just some questions about shana fring .
i thought the new york detectives
were handling that case .
they are .
but shana was a former resident of rosewood ,
so we &apos;re just helping them gather further information .
yeah , i see , i see .
did you know shana well ?
no . she was never actually a student of mine .
did you ever mention to her
that your mother owned a theater in new york ?
no , i never mentioned that to any of my students .
so it &apos;s just a coincidence
that her body was found there ?
it came as quite a shock to me and my family .
you were shot the night before shana was killed .
that &apos;s right .
when we found shana ,
she had some gun residue on her sweatshirt .
sorry , what was the question ?
do you remember anything about your mugger ,
something that would help the investigation ?
nothing that i haven &apos;t already said .
well , that &apos;s all for now .
thank you for your time .
yes , of course .
well , let me know if i can be of any further help ,
lieutenant .
i certainly will .
you need to give me those names , paige .
the ones conspiring with mona .
i can &apos;t tell you ,
especially after the way alison treated her .
mona altered that video , paige .
even if she did , mona didn &apos;t make her say those things .
alison isn &apos;t sorry about the way she treated anybody .
she &apos;s still the same manipulative person
she always was .
whoever blew up the cavanaugh house
is now threatening her .
i thought it was a gas leak .
someone caused that leak .
and you think it &apos;s mona ?
it &apos;s possible .
with a little help from her friends .
why would mona wanna blow up the cavanaugh house ?
that &apos;s what we &apos;re trying to figure out .
look , i know how you feel about alison .
but could you live with yourself if something happened to her ,
knowing that you could &apos;ve done something to stop it ?
all your father did was
substitute one ridiculous lie for another .
well , maybe you &apos;d change your mind
if you just talk to him .
i don &apos;t even want to look at him right now .
well , you &apos;re going to have to .
he at least deserves to know that you &apos;re gonna leave him .
unless you expect me to deliver that news as well .
great .
your father &apos;s here .
i asked him to come .
yeah , i got it .
okay .
thanks .
um , noel &apos;s gonna pick me up from princeton station at 10 : 00 .
you &apos;re taking the train ?
not from here .
i need you to take me to newtown station at 8 : 00 .
no . no .
i &apos;ll drive you to princeton .
look , i want to make sure that you get there safely .
and my mom &apos;s out with ted , so we can use her car .
hanna , you don &apos;t have to give me so much .
ali , you can &apos;t just walk out of your house with a bag of clothes .
you &apos;re right .
but i want to see my dad ...
before i leave .
and i need to get a few things from my house .
well , i &apos;ll drop you off now
and then i &apos;ll go get cash for you .
and just call me whenever you &apos;re ready to leave .
thank you .
you &apos;re really saving me , hanna .
come on .
okay , we need to get these boxes out of here right now .
okay , let &apos;s just slow down a second here .
tanner &apos;s probably on her way back here with a search warrant .
she &apos;s not on her way back here .
how can you say that ?
i mean she basically said
she knows that shana was the one that shot you .
well , then why would she want to search my place ?
&apos;cause she knows that you &apos;re hiding something , that &apos;s why .
well , she &apos;s gonna need a whole lot
more than suspicion to get a search warrant .
if she does come back , she &apos;s gonna find proof
that you were lying about how well you knew shana
and that ali wasn &apos;t kidnapped .
i guess i could move this stuff into my storage unit .
wait , no .
no , because if it &apos;s registered in your name ,
they &apos;re just gonna search that , too .
okay , let &apos;s just put everything in my attic
until we find a better place .
my dad &apos;s in syracuse until sunday .
okay . that &apos;s a good idea .
what is this ?
oh , my god , i think that &apos;s supposed to be mrs. dilaurentis .
how can you tell ?
i mean that &apos;s her house .
she was obsessed with her roses .
and she definitely wore scarves like that .
bethany .
how many bethanys do you know ?
just one .
and she was buried in mrs. dilaurentis &apos; backyard .
ezra , who would want you to have this ?
why ?
my money &apos;s on &quot; a. &quot;
i still have my security cameras up in the hallway .
hey , didn &apos;t you hear me knocking ?
no . sorry .
paige named names .
lucas and melissa are working with mona .
and they &apos;re all after alison .
melissa ?
oh , my god . have you told spencer ?
no , not yet .
where is ali ?
she went home to have dinner with her dad .
i &apos;ll go tell her .
no !
why don &apos;t you wait till the morning to do that ?
this is too important to wait .
8 o &apos;clock train ?
yeah .
i was thinking of visiting my grandma .
wrong direction , hanna .
new jersey isn &apos;t on the way to oklahoma .
ali &apos;s leaving .
no . she &apos;s not .
she was going to but i stopped her .
i don &apos;t believe you .
emily , wait .
okay , fine . you &apos;re right .
how could you let her go without telling us ?
it &apos;s not safe for her here .
like she &apos;ll be safer out there all alone .
it &apos;s what she wants .
are you sure that &apos;s the only reason
why you &apos;re helping her ?
what is that supposed to mean ?
your hair . your clothes .
you know , a lot &apos;s changed with you
since she &apos;s been back .
oh , yeah . and nothing &apos;s changed with you ?
i saw you holding her hand last night .
she was frightened .
she reached for me .
what was i supposed to do , slap her hand ?
don &apos;t you dare follow me .
let &apos;s go , ladies .
practice starts in one minute .
dad ?
hey , where are you ?
no , i didn &apos;t get your message .
that &apos;s okay .
yeah , don &apos;t worry .
um , i &apos;ll just sleep over at hanna &apos;s tonight .
i love you , too .
bye , dad .
逃出来的宝芬妮 · 杨
驾驶证 温特 · 玛尔尼 纽约
dad ?
no !
no !
oh , my god .
ali .
it &apos;s okay .
we &apos;re calling the police .
no . you can &apos;t do that .
and you can &apos;t call my dad either .
ali , someone broke into your house and attacked you .
exactly .
okay , if anyone knows that this happened ,
i &apos;m never gonna be able to leave here .
look , if you don &apos;t want anyone to know then fine .
okay , but you &apos;re not going anywhere .
at least , not tonight .
mind if i come in ?
sure .
toby told me that i &apos;d find you here .
what &apos;s up ?
i don &apos;t know .
just wanted to see you .
something happen ?
ali was gonna leave town tonight for good
and i was helping her .
look , whoever killed ali &apos;s mom is still out there .
i understand her wanting to go .
i realized i wasn &apos;t helping her to keep her safe .
part of me wanted her gone .
it makes sense .
you never liked who you were when you were around her .
i still do ...
want her gone .
hanna , whatever she stirred up inside of you
is not gonna go away even , if she leaves .
i should know .
i left ravenswood and what happened there
is still with me .
what did happen ?
and i know it &apos;s not just about
you not knowing where miranda is .
well , i hope you decide to stay .
you see anything yet ?
just you , arriving at my door .
i can &apos;t believe you still have a camera in your hallway .
makes sense with all the research material here .
so whoever dropped off that picture
had to have done it after i arrived
but before tanner came .
yeah .
okay , now we wait .
you know , i &apos;ve been thinking ...
maybe you should tell tanner the truth about shana .
you know , that she was the one that shot you .
where &apos;s this coming from ?
ezra , you lied to the police .
you could get into serious trouble .
but if i tell the truth now ,
they &apos;re gonna know i &apos;ve been covering something up .
oh , god , i hate that i dragged you into this mess .
you didn &apos;t .
i dragged myself into it when i decided to write a book .
oh . did you see that ?
no . go back .
do you know who that is ?
yeah , it &apos;s eddie lamb .
he works at radley and he &apos;s one of the people
i interviewed for the book .
eddie lamb ?
that &apos;s who spencer talked to today .
she said he wouldn &apos;t tell her a thing ,
that it was against radley policy .
i guess he &apos;s had a change of heart .
okay , but why leave it for you and not spencer ?
it wasn &apos;t &quot; a. &quot;
whoever it was could &apos;ve killed me and chose not to .
who would want to scare you like that ?
lucas .
your sister .
melissa ?
she &apos;s part of mona &apos;s gang .
look , we don &apos;t know who it is . okay ?
it was too dark to see anything .
oh , my god .
how could this happen ?
it happened because she was alone .
hanna wasn &apos;t with her .
where is hanna ?
i didn &apos;t call her .
she was gonna help ali leave town tonight .
what ?
what ?
don &apos;t be pissed at her .
what happened is just more proof that i should go .
we &apos;re no closer to figuring out who &quot; a &quot; is .
that might not be true .
eddie lamb gave this to ezra .
eddie ? wait , from radley ?
yeah .
what &apos;s it supposed to be ?
it &apos;s a drawing of my mother .
we think that bethany drew that while she was in there .
so they did know each other .
doesn &apos;t look like bethany liked your mom too much .
really ? what gave it away ?
was it the demon or the spear ?
what did eddie say ?
he didn &apos;t .
he left it anonymously .
ezra still has a camera in his hallway
and we saw it on the video .
i don &apos;t get it .
why would eddie leave that for ezra ?
eddie wants ezra to know
that there &apos;s something to look into at radley .
one of us has to get in there .
i vote spencer .
what ?
you know the place the best .
i can &apos;t go back in there .
i was committed .
and her dad helped toby &apos;s family win a settlement against radley .
i think i have a way in .
&quot; see how easy it is for me to kill you ?
if you leave rosewood , i will . a. &quot;
i don &apos;t get it .
for 2 years , &quot; a &apos;s &quot; been hunting you down
like a warrior cat and now--
&quot; a &quot; wants you alive and in town .
but why ?
what &apos;s worse than death ?
i never thanked you for what you did tonight .
i didn &apos;t do anything .
you risked your life for me , em .
most people see danger
and they run in the opposite direction
as fast as they can .
it &apos;s getting late .
do you want me to take you home ?
i don &apos;t want to be alone tonight .
can i stay here ?
we &apos;ll just sleep .
i promise .
yeah . yeah , of course .
hey , i got you banana nut .
thank you .
is toby coming ?
no .
he wanted me to stop along over at the house
to see if anything survived the fire .
ah , that poor family .
if there &apos;s something i can do for them ,
please let me know .
yeah .
i &apos;m with spencer at the brew .
i &apos;ll be there around noon .
i still have to get our stuff
and check out of the hotel first .
okay . bye .
is that dad ?
it was .
are we moving back home ?
yes .
but your father &apos;s moving out .
we decided it was the best thing for everyone .
you both decided this ?
i don &apos;t understand though .
i thought you said that everything went well ,
that you believed him that he was telling the truth .
i do .
so ?
honey , leaving your dad isn &apos;t about one lie .
it &apos;s about years of them .
i thought you guys were happy .
we were .
some of the time .
mom , can &apos;t you please ,
please just give him one more chance ?
no , honey .
i already have .
too many .
what are you doing for lunch later ?
do you want to eat with me ? my treat .
i can &apos;t . i got things to do .
look , i &apos;m sorry for not calling you back last night .
there was just-- there &apos;s been a lot--
going on .
right ?
yeah .
i mean , with ali back--
caleb .
when i saw him this morning at the grille
i figured that &apos;s why you &apos;ve been so distracted .
that &apos;s not the only reason .
well , i &apos;ll give you one less thing to worry about .
travis , wait .
i can &apos;t keep doing this if you &apos;re only in it halfway .
i like you too much for that .
you have a great school record
