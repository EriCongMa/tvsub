right now , all i see is sand .
so , south ...
sandistan , i think .
when are you gonna get home ?
they kept me out here for 10 months . who knows ?
do you need to get that ?
no , not right now .
you sure ?
maybe you have to sign for something .
special delivery .
this is a treat .
you never surprise me at home .
how &apos;d you get the time off ?
james ?
you can stop faking .
来活儿了
when you &apos;re really asleep , you do that leg twitch thing .
no , i don &apos;t .
what &apos;s going on ?
&apos;cause there &apos;s something .
why does there have to be something ?
can &apos;t i just want to make my wife happy ?
it &apos;s nothing .
it &apos;s a good thing .
so there is a thing .
yes . but i &apos;ve been in an airplane for 20 hours ,
and we &apos;re not gonna talk about this right now .
and i also just heard your phone go off .
that means you &apos;ve got a psycho killer to catch .
we aren &apos;t done talking about this .
shh . i &apos;m sleeping .
look .
it looks like someone is taking the term &quot; motor city &quot; too literally .
in the last month ,
detroit p.d. has found two different crime scenes
in the trunks of two different cars .
married couples in each trunk ?
yeah . brian and melissa cain in car number one ,
paul and elizabeth garrett in car number two .
elizabeth was found alive by a couple of kids ,
but by the time the paramedics got there ,
she had lost too much blood .
well , it takes a lot of skill to force a couple into their own car ,
even with a gun .
but once he does , it &apos;s one @-@ stop shopping for this guy .
his car become an abduction vehicle and a dumping site .
according to missing persons reports ,
he holds on to them for about a week .
do you know what he does with them during that time ?
yes , unfortunately i do , and that information
is on your tablets in picture form .
and if you &apos;ll excuse me , i &apos;m going to go to my happy place .
wow , this guy sure likes to cut , doesn &apos;t he ?
mostly shallow .
they could almost be considered hesitation marks ,
except for the sheer number .
m.e. puts the count at nearly 50 per victim ,
and the cause of death is one final stab that &apos;s fatal .
physical and psychological sadism .
they never know if the next cut is the one that will kill them .
and the amount of urban decay in detroit
gives him a lot of room to maneuver .
we need to stop him before he takes another couple .
oh , god .
oh , god ...
it &apos;s ok . it &apos;s ok . it &apos;s all right . just hang on .
why is he doing this to us ?
i don &apos;t know , i don &apos;t .
mary , i can &apos;t help you .
you have to take it out .
no , no . no , you &apos;ll die .
phillip ...
it &apos;s time .
thank you .
thank you .
oh , phillip ...
mary ...
noooo !
&quot; we are not the same persons this years as last ,
nor are those we love .
it is a happy chance if we , changing ,
continue to love the changed person . &quot;
w. somerset maugham .
so , we know this unsub uses the victims &apos; own cars as his dumpsite .
technically , it &apos;s not a dumpsite ,
it &apos;s a transportation disposal modality .
the point is ,
what does he do once he abandons the car ? walk ?
well , both cars were found about 500 feet
from public transportation .
he could catch a bus or a train ,
but back to where ?
his secondary location is most likely in detroit .
both the couples he kidnapped are from grosse pointe ,
which is one of the most affluent communities in all of america ,
and it &apos;s only 8 miles from downtown .
well , then he &apos;s probably from grosse pointe , too .
to overwhelm two people at once , he has to blend in .
it feels like the real question is , why married couples ?
if he &apos;s a sadist ,
having a witness to his torture heightens his pleasure .
israel keyes kidnapped a husband and wife at gunpoint ,
got them in a car , took them to a remote location ,
and then killed the husband in front of the wife .
keyes was a sexual sadist , though .
this guy , i don &apos;t know .
cutting a husband and wife to death ,
it &apos;s--it &apos;s more like he &apos;s mocking their marriage bond .
that &apos;s where my head &apos;s at .
they took each other for better or worse ,
now i &apos;m going to show you worse .
so his home life &apos;s probably a wreck .
at least one ex @-@ wife , not to mention his mom and dad .
all right , we need to hit the ground running .
reid , i want you working on a geographic profile .
blake , you and rossi go to the morgue , cover victimology .
jj and morgan , go look at the cars .
we need to understand how he &apos;s gaining control of the victims .
near as i can tell , your guy cuts in a mirror pattern .
what he does to the husband
he matches with the wife .
except the wife had diagonal cuts downward
and the husband &apos;s were horizontal .
in their chest and torso , yeah .
that gives me a sense of the attacker &apos;s height .
if the attacker &apos;s taller than the victim ,
the knife will go down .
but if he &apos;s shorter , it &apos;ll go in straight .
so the unsub &apos;s taller than the wife but shorter than the husband .
wife &apos;s 5 &apos; 4 , &quot; husband &apos;s 5 &apos; 8 , &quot;
so the unsub &apos;s about 5 &apos; 7 . &quot;
shrimpy guy .
wait a minute . look at the first couple .
she was 5 &apos; 11 , &quot; he was 6 &apos; 2 . &quot;
but the cutting angle is the same .
down on her , straight on him .
well , it doesn &apos;t work if the unsub &apos;s 5 &apos; 7 . &quot;
the geometry &apos;s off .
i couldn &apos;t account for it .
frankly , i was hoping you could .
right . face me .
put your right hand up .
i &apos;m the wife , i &apos;m 5 &apos; 4 . &quot;
stab me in the chest .
but i do the same to you .
this is why he takes couples .
he wants them to hurt each other .
i posted extra patrols around the transit stops like you requested .
good .
and i gave dr. reid as detailed a map
of detroit and grosse pointe as i could .
so , he should be all right there .
what &apos;d you find ?
well , date night is very important to this unsub .
he goes on dates ?
no , but his victims do , and the unsub knows that .
brian and melissa cain were abducted on a saturday night .
their last known credit card purchase
was at an ice cream shop they regularly frequent .
paul and elizabeth garrett had a standing matinee
they went to every sunday .
they were abducted in the early evening ,
most likely on the way to their car .
he stalks them and learns their routines .
picks couples @-@ oriented activities as his moment to strike .
seeing them happy could enrage him .
it gives him the upper hand .
they &apos;re focused on each other . they don &apos;t see him coming .
ok , then , but how does he get them both into the car ?
get in the car or i &apos;ll kill your wife .
i could see that once , but twice ?
well , let &apos;s play it out .
all right .
i would sit in the front seat .
the unsub would get in the back with the wife .
he &apos;d make the wife get in first .
it &apos;s just awkward .
there &apos;s too many variables .
he could lose control at any minute .
somebody fights back
or the husband just waits for the wife to get in
and then locks the unsub out .
well , what if he was waiting inside the car ?
it &apos;s dark , they &apos;re not paying attention .
he jimmies a door .
but that would leave a mark .
he didn &apos;t leave any marks .
all right , well , let &apos;s go look at the other car .
hey , jj , wait a minute .
what ?
the car didn &apos;t lock .
it beeped .
yeah , it beeped ...
but it &apos;s not making that locking sound .
he &apos;s hacking the cars .
that &apos;s how he &apos;s getting in .
how we doing , baby girl ?
we are doing terrible . we have another one .
my guys found the car 90 minutes ago .
make and model tells me it doesn &apos;t belong in the neighborhood .
what are we , 5 miles from the last crime scene ?
less .
what do you know about the victim ?
well , the car is registered to dennis hammond .
this is his wife mary .
she was dumped alone . he &apos;s off pattern .
what about the husband ? did the unsub have a shot at him ?
actually , your agents are talking to him now .
oh , god .
uh , mr. hammond , if you want ,
we can do this at the station .
no .
no , what do you need to know ?
can you explain why it took you two days
to file a missing persons report on mary ?
i was traveling . i didn &apos;t know .
you didn &apos;t check in with your wife ?
we &apos;d been fighting .
about what ?
we have a standing thursday night dinner
at our favorite restaurant .
last thursday my boss told me
i had to stay in cleveland through the weekend .
but i didn &apos;t get around to telling her that ...
till later that night .
when she went to the restaurant by herself .
yeah .
so , the victim was supposed to meet her husband for date night
and he never showed up .
so the unsub wanted both but only got one .
he &apos;s been patient and organized up to now .
why wouldn &apos;t he wait ?
maybe one was enough ?
no . he gets off on watching couples .
this unsub wouldn &apos;t change his m.o. without a reason .
we &apos;re missing a male victim .
hi , honey , it &apos;s me . i picked up your prescription
and now i &apos;m on my way home .
i &apos;ll see you soon .
just calling to check in .
what are you talking about ?
you never check in . you &apos;re always too busy
when you &apos;re on a case to do anything .
well , today i am .
so ... how are you ?
i &apos;m fine .
you quit doctors without borders , didn &apos;t you ?
i did not.- just say it .
i did not quit .
well , then what ?
come on , you &apos;re killing me here .
the worst thing you can do to a linguist is not communicate .
alex--
you knew that when we got engaged .
alex , they offered me the position at harvard .
they did ?
yeah .
decent hours .
better pay .
what did you tell them ?
i told them that i would only consider it
if they gave you a position in the linguistics department ,
and they said ok .
they did ?
they did .
now do you understand
why i was waiting for you to come home
so we could , you know , celebrate this thing together ?
this good thing .
it is . it &apos;s a very good thing .
it &apos;s just ...
not what you want .
not right now .
it &apos;s taken me 10 years to get here .
not just to get to the bau ,
but to restore my reputation inside the bureau .
i know .
and the job comes first for both of us .
that was the deal .
yeah , well , the deal also came with veto power .
remember ? one of us could always say ,
i want to be a couple again .
alex ...
i want to be a couple again .
blake .
i gotta go . let me think about it .
that means no .
no . no , it means let me think about it .
love you .
what do you have ?
grosse pointe p.d. got another missing persons report .
emma churchill .
married ?
her husband called it in .
why doesn &apos;t this unsub want men anymore ?
the condition of mary hammond
is drastically different than the couples .
fewer cuts on her , but he held her for a shorter period of time .
it &apos;s not just quantity , it &apos;s quality .
the cuts are more superficial .
like he &apos;s trying not to hurt her .
until the one final stab in the sternum .
she died quickly .
that doesn &apos;t make sense .
the unsub doesn &apos;t want to kill her quickly .
he &apos;s a sadist .
why would he do that ?
he wouldn &apos;t .
but whoever she was locked up with would .
you think there &apos;s another victim ,
one that we didn &apos;t account for ?
you asked why this unsub doesn &apos;t want men .
it could because he still has one .
based on the ages of the victims ,
we believe that the unsub
is a 30- 40 @-@ year @-@ old white male from grosse pointe .
up until now he &apos;s been an equal opportunity ,
anger retaliatory sadist .
which is fancy talk for
he hates the husbands as much as the wives .
most likely because his own marriage failed in a humiliating way .
and his wife left him for a man
she may be engaged or even already married to .
but a major shift happened with mary hammond .
he wasn &apos;t able to kidnap the husband ,
but he needed someone to cut her .
so his m.o. was forced to evolve .
we believe he &apos;s abducted the sixth victim , a man ,
probably someone who reminds him of his own failed marriage .
and he &apos;s keeping number 6 alive so he can repeat the process
with emma churchill .
number 6 could be a surrogate
for the ex @-@ wife &apos;s new husband
or actually be the new husband .
which is why the fastest way to find this unsub
is through this most recent unknown victim .
we need missing person reports for all men
in grosse pointe and detroit as soon as possible .
even though number 6 was forced to kill mary hammond ,
he may find it easier to cross that line with emma churchill .
what the hell ...
i don &apos;t belong in here !
is there anybody in there ?
hello !
shut up .
hello !
shut up !
do you want him to come in here ?
him , who ?
him .
so we didn &apos;t see the pattern
until we inspected mary hammond &apos;s car .
we know he hacks the remote . it &apos;s not hard .
it runs on a radio frequency .
pretty easy to jam . 20 bucks at your local electronics store .
all right , so the victim thinks she &apos;s locked her car .
but she hasn &apos;t .
we thought that explained his entire abduction m.o. ,
then garcia ran a diagnostic on this car &apos;s onboard computer .
hey , baby girl . take it away , mama .
sir , this guy is creepy clever .
if i may direct your attention to the gps .
yeah , i &apos;m looking at it right now .
all right , the map seems to be working fine .
when you drive , the map moves with you .
let &apos;s see what happens if you look at the driving history .
he covers his tracks ,
so we we can &apos;t find a secondary location .
yeah . like i said , creepy clever .
and here is the diabolical part .
when i checked the software &apos;s internal time stamp
to see when he turned it off , it &apos;s the same on every car--
3 days before date night .
all right . thanks , garcia .
of course , of course .
so he breaks into the car before the abductions .
even his stalking &apos;s organized .
but in order to pull that off ,
he needs access to their cars without attracting attention .
we &apos;ve already checked garages and dealerships .
nothing matched the service records .
which means there &apos;s some target @-@ rich location
where all the victims go .
they park , he hacks in .
we just don &apos;t know where .
yes , this is ssa aaron hotchner .
i need to speak to the a.g. , please , as soon as possible .
yes , sir . the bau needs a favor .
and we need it fast .
no .
there &apos;s been some kind of mistake .
i didn &apos;t do anything wrong !
you can call my husband . he &apos;s waiting for me .
did he attack you in your car ?
there was no mistake .
i &apos;ve been in here long enough to realize
he doesn &apos;t make mistakes .
how long have you been in here ?
is it still april ?
no .
it &apos;s may .
may .
he ... he gives me clean clothes and food , but ...
there &apos;s no schedule to it . i can &apos;t keep track of the days .
oh , my god .
what &apos;s your name ?
emma .
hi , emma .
i &apos;m phillip .
begin .
what does that mean ?
i just want you to know ...
i &apos;m really sorry we have to do this .
oh , my god .
agent hotchner , what you &apos;re asking for is extremely sensitive .
we &apos;re asking for you to cooperate with a federal investigation .
you &apos;re presuming
that the 3 different car companies represented in this room
track our drivers via their gps .
that &apos;s a bold presumption .
actually , it &apos;s not bold , and we &apos;re presuming nothing .
when customers access their gps for the first time ,
they go to a &quot; terms and conditions &quot; screen .
they scroll to the bottom , they click the box that says &quot; agree &quot;
so they can start using it .
they don &apos;t realize they &apos;ve just agreed
to allowing their car to communicate its entire driving history
with your corporate headquarters .
for research purposes only , of course .
the only reason these people
agree to share this information with you
is that they don &apos;t take the time to read the fine print .
but i do .
we &apos;ll need to consult with risk management .
we don &apos;t have time for lawyers .
a woman &apos;s life is on the line and we need an answer now .
i said , begin .
emma , i have to come in there .
no .
no !
get away from me !
get away !
then calm down .
calm down .
it &apos;s not your turn .
it &apos;s my turn .
garcia , i don &apos;t get it .
didn &apos;t the car companies give you the same gps data ?
yes , they did .
but the meta @-@ data has to be translated into latitude and longitude ,
which is like looking for a needle in a needlestack in a field of needles .
can you match the date ?
we know he breaks into the cars 3 days beforehand .
well , that would imply that
there is a time stamp on each of the numbers ,
which there is not , thank you very much .
and forgive my tone , but i am frustrated !
wait .
my mood is changing .
we may have a lotto here .
ding . there is exactly one point of common intersection
for each of the 4 cars ,
and i am sending it to you now .
want to take a field trip ?
i don &apos;t get it .
why here ?
access , maybe . he knows the victims
will be away from their cars while they work out .
hey , what if it &apos;s a stressor for him ?
how so ?
maybe--
maybe she left him for a guy like that .
he comes here to blow off steam ,
sees that , it only makes him angrier .
when the unsub takes a closer look ,
he sees she &apos;s wearing a ring .
so he follows her back to her car ,
and he &apos;s picked his next victim .
he &apos;s gotten to the point where any husband and wife will do .
that &apos;s a lot of anger .
what do you mean , it &apos;s your turn ?
i mean , you have-- you have to stab me .
what ? i &apos;m not gonna do that .
then he &apos;ll kill us both .
now , i &apos;m gonna go sit down on your cot .
this is some sort of trick .
no .
it &apos;s better if i sit .
in case i pass out .
you have until i count to 3 .
ignore him and do what i say .
1 ...
just do it , right here . it won &apos;t even hurt .
2 ...
just do it , ok ? just right here , emma .
oh , god !
3 .
please .
there , see ? you did it .
do it again .
what ? no !
again .
no !
no , please .
what &apos;s your husband &apos;s name ?
let go ! let go !
my wife &apos;s name is maya .
i say her name to remind myself why i &apos;m still alive .
stop , please , don &apos;t !
what &apos;s his name , emma ?
please , what &apos;s his name ?
say his name .
his name is john .
you &apos;re doing this for john .
no !
all right , so the unsub &apos;s using the track as his hunting ground ,
which means he found number 6 there , too .
and that victim would have pushed his button in a special way .
you think he could be one of the trainers ?
none of the missing men are particularly athletic .
so a regular old fitness buff , then .
worked out at the track ,
just happened to talk to the wrong unsub .
well , jj and i like phillip connor .
this guy .
how come ?
well , for starters , his mother reported him missing
just after mary hammond disappeared .
and when i spoke to his mom ,
she told me that he and his wife maya got engaged
while she was still married to another man .
that would push the unsub &apos;s buttons , all right .
keep digging into phillip connor .
if he is number 6,
then he &apos;ll lead us to the unsub .
i &apos;m gonna need one more .
oh , yes .
so you and john ,
how &apos;d you guys meet ?
i &apos;d rather not say .
yeah .
might as well . we &apos;re gonna be here a while .
ok . you first .
when i started dating maya ,
she was already ...
you know .
with somebody .
married to somebody .
it was awkward when we did the whole round of meet the friends .
they &apos;d ask , so how did you guys meet ?
we &apos;d be like ...
well ...
it was a christian dating website .
so you met online . what &apos;s the big--
i &apos;m not christian . i &apos;m jewish .
technically .
technically .
genetically . but i &apos;ve never set foot in a synagogue .
how &apos;d you break that to john ?
i haven &apos;t .
yet .
get back in your cell .
don &apos;t . don &apos;t go .
it &apos;s ok . we can still talk through the glass .
come here .
listen carefully .
there &apos;s a way out of here .
you don &apos;t want me to--
no .
you want to talk about what &apos;s bothering you ?
no . nothing &apos;s bothering me .
something &apos;s bothering you . i can always tell when you &apos;re bothered
because you whisper lyrics to yourself .
hip hop specifically .
i thought it was odd at first , but then i remembered
your dissertation was on the fluidity of metaphor .
you seem to have a particular fondness for nas .
how did you know ?
morgan made me listen to him when we started working together .
he said anybody that can &apos;t
quote &quot; illmatic &quot; is ignorant .
so ... do you want to talk about it ?
oh . the text , it &apos;s from my husband .
is that a bad thing ?
he just wants to know if i &apos;ve thought about his offer .
what offer ?
to teach with him at harvard .
how would you tea--
yeah .
tough call . what do you think you &apos;re gonna do ?
when we got married , part of the attraction
was that we were both obsessed with our work ,
and for a while that was ok .
yeah , the last time we talked about it ,
you seemed to prefer it .
oh , not anymore .
i don &apos;t like going home to an empty house .
may i offer some advice ?
sure .
we need to turn around . you just passed the house .
that &apos;s not the advice , though .
blake , for the last 10 years ,
this job has been my life .
and then , for a few months ,
i had a taste of what you have .
so , work ...
there &apos;s always work ,
and there &apos;ll always be work .
what &apos;s rare is finding someone who makes us happy .
yes , my son went to that track .
did he ever talk about who he met there ,
maybe someone who took a particular interest in him and maya ?
mrs. connor ?
he didn &apos;t go there to exercise .
he went there to watch maya .
why would he watch his own wife ?
after they married ,
phillip started to get , uh ...
funny .
he kept saying to me ,
if she cheated with me , she &apos;ll cheat on me , mom .
did she cheat on him ?
no .
but she had had enough .
they &apos;re not divorced , but they are separated .
and i can &apos;t say i blame her .
my son is sick .
he enjoys being sick .
it makes people pay attention to him .
we need to talk to maya as soon as possible .
do you have her phone number ?
uh ... yeah .
i &apos;ll go get my cell phone .
wait .
your son &apos;s sickness--
does he cut himself ?
h @-@ how did you know ?
emma .
help me .
let me in there .
let me in !
oh , god . what did he do to you ?
punished me for helping you .
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m so sorry .
it &apos;s not your fault .
ok ? it &apos;s not--
cut him .
leave him alone !
cut him or i &apos;ll kill you .
how can number 6 be the unsub ?
we profiled a sadist .
that all changed when he had mary hammond alone .
he found something else that worked for him .
the guy &apos;s wife left him because he was a cutter .
so he took those women not because of sex
but because of something better .
they validate his obsessive @-@ compulsive disorder ,
turn it into a shared bonding experience .
then he got to play two roles--
the unsub who tortures and the sympathetic prisoner .
so i just spoke with phillip &apos;s soon @-@ to @-@ be ex @-@ wife .
according to her , he lives in a day @-@ rate motel .
he &apos;d need more space and privacy than that .
i &apos;m here , sir .
what do we know about phillip connor &apos;s work history ?
uh , he freelanced in the area , mostly computer stuff ,
that the car company subcontracted out to .
he needs infrastructure . something he could convert .
garcia , what work site sticks out as the biggest ?
there &apos;s a microprocessor plant in foreclosure .
is that the kind of thing you &apos;re looking for ?
the clean rooms . he could seal his prisoners in there
and no one could hear them scream .
we &apos;re gonna need a strategy .
if he &apos;s got abandonment issues ,
he won &apos;t hesitate to kill emma .
unless we give him something he wants even more .
can you make that happen ?
if i can &apos;t , it &apos;s gonna be one hell of a bluff .
and i need your help .
what do we do ?
you have to .
you &apos;ll die .
we don &apos;t have a choice .
no . no , we can fight .
