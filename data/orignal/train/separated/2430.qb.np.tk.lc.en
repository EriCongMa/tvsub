silas .
hello , my shadow self .
every time i close my eyes ,
i can feel myself drowning ,
and i need to make it stop .
after months of heartache and pain ...
bonnie &apos;s dead , elena .
... we still hold on to hope .
i want to use silas &apos;s death
to bring bonnie back to life .
i can feel you !
bonnie ?
it worked !
i &apos;m back .
but our victory came at a cost .
my hair is going gray ,
and my teeth are falling out .
i &apos;m not sure what that suggests ,
but it &apos;s definitely not health .
you &apos;re aging , katherine .
you have a few months .
every supernatural being that passes over to the other side
will pass through you .
that &apos;s gonna hurt like a bitch .
and new threats are about to rise .
good news about having vampire blood in your system is ,
is that &apos;s step one to creating a new vampire .
this is step two .
preliminary report subject 62547 .
subject has transformed from human to vampire
in approximately 14 days .
indicators predict a positive response
to first bag of undiluted augustine blood .
physical strength is an unforeseen side effect .
terminating transfusion .
activating emergency procedures .
hi , mom !
i know we haven &apos;t seen each other or talked in a while ,
so i wanted to make you a video update .
um , i finally finished my whirlwind summer tour ,
got a new do ,
and i &apos;m in college at whitmore ,
where grams taught .
this is my dorm !
it &apos;s huge , right ?
look .
it even has a fireplace !
i mean , what dorm has a fireplace ?
oh , here they are !
hey , guys ! say hi to my mom !
they &apos;re planning me a welcome party .
just--just something hokey .
i miss you .
um , please come visit when--ha--
when you get a chance .
i &apos;ll , um , i &apos;ll talk to you soon .
mmm @-@ wha . bye .
&quot; and by the way , mom ,
i &apos;m not a witch anymore
because i died and then came back from the other side . &quot;
&quot; yeah . i &apos;m the supernatural anchor
that connects our two worlds together , so ... &quot;
&quot; technically , i &apos;m a ghost
that people can still see and touch , so ... &quot;
ok . so i left out a detail ... or two .
i &apos;ll explain when she visits .
how big is this party going to be ?
well , let &apos;s see .
silas and tessa are gone ,
and you finally aren &apos;t .
which equals massive cause for celebration !
which equals a massive party .
hopefully since
each of us have only made one friend in college so far .
and given that mine went radio silent after he kissed me ,
and your
was last seen at a tea party for a vampire @-@ hating secret society .
hmm . augustine , right ?
the one who covered up your roommate &apos;s death
and wants to kick you off campus ?
what ? i &apos;ve kept up !
the other side is boring .
what else am i supposed to do ?
all right . so augustine wants us gone .
who cares ? it doesn &apos;t matter .
it &apos;s not gonna happen .
we &apos;re moving on with our lives
together as functional vampires ,
former witch anchor thing .
i don &apos;t know .
and we &apos;re having a party .
with jell @-@ o shots !
oh , shoot !
um , i have to go register for classes .
what ?
nothing .
have fun registering .
oh , my god !
oh , my god !
wait . registering for classes ?
i know . i--she &apos;s-- i know i have elena &apos;s blessing .
i still don &apos;t need to rub it in her face
day one in the triple dorm room .
we could always sneak back to my place .
you mean , damon &apos;s house ?
while we &apos;re at it , why don &apos;t we just have sex in his bathtub ,
or maybe katherine could watch .
this hair , by the way , kind of hot .
you ok ?
yep .
i got to go to class .
see you tonight ?
yeah .
ok .
i &apos;m ready .
i know this is gonna sound lame , but--
any time you start with &quot; this is gonna sound lame , &quot;
guess what--it is .
this is for bonnie ,
and you had a really big part in bringing her back ,
so i think that you should come .
oh ! wait . hang on . wait .
hey ! hey , aaron .
hi . long time , no see .
here . you &apos;re coming .
who &apos;s aaron ?
party in a dorm . no , thanks .
i know what you &apos;re doing .
you like to push people away ,
but the thing is-
how do you know that about me ?
because you told me at the costume ball
when i compelled it out of you .
ok . forget that i said that ,
forget that i know anything .
we &apos;re starting over .
you &apos;re coming to my party .
there will be free beer ,
and it will be really good for you .
see you then .
see you tonight .
well , that was an embarrassingly close call .
maybe i should be there
so you don &apos;t spill all of our secrets
and make out with the moody mystery guy .
the only moody mystery guy that i want to make out with is you .
oh , and speaking of which , invite stefan .
speaking of moody or making out ?
either way , he &apos;ll never show .
his memory &apos;s back , and he remembers he hates us .
just try , ok ? i bought bourbon ,
so he could just get drunk
and hate us from afar .
well , i &apos;ll be sure to relay the message .
so apparently we &apos;ve been invited to a college party .
yeah . that was my first reaction , too .
then elena promised a bottomless well of top @-@ shelf alcohol .
stefan ?
you ... ok ?
yeah , i &apos;m fine .
how about my favorite reading chair ?
just tell elena thanks ,
but i &apos;m not really up for a party tonight .
how about now ?
matty blue @-@ blue , i want another drink .
no ! you &apos;re drunk and scaring the customers .
you realize that every single time you say no
it just makes you hotter , right ?
what are you watching , some czech reality show ?
how &apos;d you know it was czech ?
eye contact . we &apos;re getting started .
you translate , you drink .
ok .
what the hell am i looking at here ?
so over the summer , i went to prague , met a girl .
she followed me back here .
and then her boyfriend put some spirit thing in my head .
oh , dear . this is bad .
why ?
my friends will come looking for this blade .
protect it at all costs .
some guy named kristof ,
he , um-- he activated you .
what do you mean activated me ?
he &apos;s a traveler .
travelers are a faction of witches .
they &apos;re big on spirit possession .
you &apos;ve got one inside of you .
it &apos;s kind of like a human parasite
that &apos;s hitching a ride in your brain .
so how the hell do i get it out of me ?
that girl , the one that followed you back from prague ,
was she , um , i don &apos;t know ,
feisty , a little accent ,
ridiculously beautiful ?
pretty much , yeah .
her name was nadia .
why ? do you know her ?
you could say that .
i , uh handed out all the fliers .
oh , and , uh , damon said that he &apos;s gonna try and bring stefan .
funny . that seemed to imply that damon is actually coming .
maybe a call from a mysteriously hot biology t.a. will help .
well , look who rose from the dead .
i need your help .
what happened , jesse ?
just come to my room , please .
ok . i &apos;m coming , but what &apos;s going on ?
it &apos;s a long story . my roommate &apos;s gonna be home .
jesse !
jess , you home ?
i &apos;m sorry , man .
oh , my god .
who the hell turned you into a vampire ?
it was torture . i was in some cell all day ,
and then at night , he &apos;d take me out and do experiments on me .
what kind of experiments ?
i don &apos;t know . he &apos;d starve me
and then inject me with some weird blood .
what am i supposed to tell my parents ?
they left me all these messages .
they &apos;re wondering where the hell i am .
we &apos;re going to call them
and tell them that you lost your phone but you &apos;re ok .
where is wes now ?
i locked him in his lab after i attacked him .
honestly , though , the escape was kind of a blur .
i wasn &apos;t exactly in my right mind .
well , you &apos;re new , and you &apos;re hungry .
not for long .
i brought our stash .
how are you doing ?
&quot; our &quot; stash ?
you &apos;re a vampire , too ?
you say it like it &apos;s a bad thing .
first rule of being a vampire is realizing
how awesome you are !
how &apos;s he doing ?
he &apos;s all right . he &apos;s alive .
elena , wait .
i was thinking that jesse could do it .
you &apos;re a vampire now .
you may have hurt him , but you can also heal him
with your blood .
holy crap . that &apos;s insane .
you want to teach him about compulsion ?
hey , stranger ,
lookie what i stole .
knock yourself out .
hey . come on .
please just have one drink with me .
please . stefan , i &apos;ve had a bad ... year really ,
and it would be nice to have a friendly face .
one pity drink .
see ? the universe at work .
i don &apos;t know if you knew this ,
but our doppelganger stars are fated to be together ,
so like it or not ,
you &apos;re gonna end up with somebody who looks like me ,
although the universe seems to have
all of its eggs in the elena basket ,
but at this point , i don &apos;t really blame it .
what is wrong with you ?
other than the joint pain , receding gums ,
and the fact that i have to pee every 5 minutes ,
i &apos;m dandy ,
but , hey , enough about me .
why are you all by your lonesome ?
so i could avoid talking to anyone .
well , if you did want to talk to someone ,
i &apos;m right here ,
and , uh , let &apos;s be honest , i &apos;m wasted ,
so i &apos;m not gonna remember .
look . i thought that killing silas
would allow me to move on with my life ,
but i was wrong .
i spent my summer locked in a safe .
one minute , i think i &apos;m fine ,
the next minute i feel like i &apos;m dying all over again .
oh . classic ptsd .
you survived a pretty traumatic event ,
and now you &apos;re back , and you &apos;ve got nothing but free time
to just relive that terrible experience in the safe .
well , allow me to give your life a purpose .
help me with one little favor .
should have know this was gonna come around to you ,
needing something from me .
i &apos;m just trying to help .
what would i know about post @-@ traumatic stress ?
i only had my newborn ripped from my arms
by my judgmental father
and then had to run 500 years
after my entire family had been slaughtered by a psychopath ,
but , hey , that didn &apos;t have any lingering side effects .
hey.all right .
all right . what do you need ?
i thought you never wanted to see me again .
why &apos;d you call me ?
stefan , i &apos;d like you to meet nadia petrova ,
my daughter .
so your mom &apos;s like me , too ?
yeah . long story .
she &apos;s , um , surviving fine .
you &apos;ll be great .
your eyes keep scanning the room .
you afraid i &apos;m gonna go vampire postal on the fourth floor freshmen ?
no . i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m just looking for my , um ...
i &apos;m not sure what he is actually .
boyfriend ?
friend with benefits ?
he &apos;s my best friend &apos;s little brother ,
he &apos;s still in high school ,
and i ... think i &apos;m madly in love with him .
have you been keeping an eye on jesse ?
yep . i &apos;ve been teaching him the art
of sublimating vampire hunger via grain alcohol .
and i sent damon to question wes .
you realize that damon &apos;s going to kill wes , right ?
he &apos;s not going to kill him .
he &apos;s getting information .
you realize that you &apos;re wrong , right ?
ok . look . i know that you &apos;re not crazy
about damon and i being together--
no , no , it &apos;s fine .
i &apos;m fine with you two being together
as long as you can acknowledge
the kind of person you are together with .
what do you want ?
what i want is to be drinking copious quantities of booze
and making out with my girlfriend ,
but unfortunately , i can &apos;t do that
until i get a bunch of answers out of you .
careful with those .
these ? these right here ? why ?
i mean , we &apos;re on a college campus , right ,
full of students ?
i can &apos;t imagine an m.d.
has a bunch of infectious diseases just lying around .
m.d.-ph.d. i &apos;m a researcher .
well , that explains it .
i &apos;ve met a lot of people like you .
science over medicine , right ?
let me guess . you use these
in your little vampire lab rats , don &apos;t you ?
not in the mood to talk ?
fair enough .
we &apos;re gonna play a little game
where i inject you with
whatever the hell necrotizing fasciitis is .
it &apos;s a flesh @-@ eating bacteria .
gross .
so i &apos;m gonna do that ,
and i &apos;m gonna ask you a bunch of questions .
if you answer me correctly ,
i &apos;m gonna give you some of my delicious ...
vampire blood , and we &apos;ll heal you right on up .
if you don &apos;t answer me correctly ,
we &apos;re just gonna have to see
how much flesh these little guys can eat .
just out of morbid curiosity ,
which one of you is younger ?
i am .
right .
ok . so here &apos;s the knife the traveler left behind with me .
now what are we doing in here ?
take a seat , matt .
this is ridiculous .
what the hell was that ?
she &apos;s calling on matt &apos;s passenger .
easy , easy , easy .
hello , gregor .
i &apos;m nadia &apos;s mother .
it &apos;s a pleasure to finally meet you .
what do you want ?
here &apos;s the thing .
nadia &apos;s my only child ,
so naturally , i &apos;m suspicious of anyone who wants to date her .
why don &apos;t you tell us the real reason why you &apos;re in mystic falls ?
to track and kill silas .
oh . so it has absolutely nothing to do with this ?
how did you get that ?
i would much rather be getting drunk right now ,
so why don &apos;t you stop wasting our time
and tell us what you &apos;re doing here ?
fine . after silas was dead ,
i was meant to kill her .
i didn &apos;t see that one coming .
you were using me to get to her ? why ?
why would you kill her ?
that &apos;s what the travelers want .
i don &apos;t question my orders .
see why i don &apos;t want you dating my daughter ?
because travelers are ruthless , manipulative hypocrites .
i know ...
because your grandfather was one .
what did you just do ?
give it a rest . matt will be fine .
gregor on the other hand , not so much .
i just expelled his spirits .
there &apos;s a reason why he wanted this knife so badly .
it &apos;s the only thing that will truly kill a passenger .
turning a kid into a vampire
so you can experiment on him ?
tch . harsh .
what is it about this place
that turns people into mad scientists ?
human trials are a vital part of modern medicine .
yeah , but don &apos;t people usually volunteer or sign waivers ,
maybe get some dough for tuition .
sometimes you do what &apos;s necessary for the greater good .
i &apos;m not the greatest guy in the world ,
but it sounds like some mengele level crap
that you &apos;re spouting out ,
so i got to ask ...
what is your greater good ?
rabies . sounds fun , doesn &apos;t it ,
and appropriate given the circumstance .
are you doing ok ?
am i on the famous other side ?
you are .
what , um ... what got you here ?
i died .
no . i mean , what were you ?
a witch . what are you ?
the anchor to the other side .
every supernatural being who dies passes through me .
that doesn &apos;t seem like it &apos;d be a lot of fun for you .
it &apos;s better than being dead .
i &apos;m so sorry .
such a stupid thing to say .
it &apos;s ok , honey .
dying wasn &apos;t fun ,
but then you felt my pain ,
so i guess you know that .
i &apos;m sorry ,
but you know what ?
the pain &apos;s gone now .
and seeing a friendly face over here certainly doesn &apos;t hurt .
sorry ! pretty much had to wrestle elena to get her to give me these .
you ok ?
yeah . i think i am .
good . i &apos;m gonna need you to come with me .
where are we going ?
to register for classes .
that feels amazing .
that &apos;s one of the other fun side effects .
everything is heightened .
so that feeling never goes away ?
nope .
well , rabies was a bust .
i guess i &apos;ll find something a little more immediate .
i wanted to turn jesse into a new kind of vampire .
well , that &apos;s awfully ambitious of you .
i am awfully smart .
ebola .
why ?
your kind is dangerous to humans .
you &apos;re dangerous because we &apos;re your food source .
i want to change that .
what ?
last time i kissed you , you got all weird ,
and it was awkward , and ...
if vampires don &apos;t need to feed on humans ,
they &apos;re no longer a threat .
i &apos;m not buying the good doctor bit .
human blood will only satiate jesse temporarily ,
until he gets a taste of what he really craves .
well , what exactly does he really crave ?
you bit me .
hey . you ok ?
yeah . i just got to get out of here .
jesse !
ok . so this isn &apos;t the lamest party that i &apos;ve ever been to .
aaron , hey . you made it .
barely . i think i fell asleep .
i just woke up .
weird . well , this will make it better .
oh . now i know why wes told me to stay away from you .
cheers .
mmm . you &apos;re trouble .
so , hey .
how do you know wes anyway ?
he &apos;s my legal guardian .
really ?
what about your parents ?
uh , dead .
mine , too .
birth and adoptive .
whoa . dark .
no offense , but usually , i &apos;m the biggest freak in the room .
so how &apos;d it happen ?
uh , our car went over a bridge .
i lived , they didn &apos;t .
you ?
i was 6,
and we went camping ,
and i woke up to the sound of my mom screaming .
i went to check it out , and i saw blood everywhere .
they had bite marks all over their neck .
bite marks ?
yeah . they said a bear got into the camp .
so i shuffled around distant relatives for a while .
eventually , wes took me in .
so wes is the closest thing to family i have left .
i think we both need another jell @-@ o shot .
i &apos;ll be right back .
i &apos;m glad that you came .
yeah . me too .
hey . have you seen jesse ?
no .
wait . where are you going ?
to call damon ,
to make sure that he doesn &apos;t kill dr. wes .
there you are .
get away from me .
stefan , you &apos;re ok .
relax .
i can &apos;t do that .
do you understand me ?
you have two options , stefan .
you either deal with this now , or you run ,
but either way , it &apos;s gonna catch up to you .
i can &apos;t breathe , stefan .
stefan , tell me the name of the first person that you kill--
ahh--killed . mmm . name him .
gius-- giuseppe salvatore .
and the next ?
focus on the name .
thomas fell .
see ? you &apos;re in control , on solid ground .
you &apos;re not drowning . you &apos;re not dying .
name them .
honoria fell , marianna lockwood ,
christopher gilbert ,
margaret forbes .
see ? i told you i knew what i was doing .
thank you .
you &apos;re right .
gregor is dead . happy now ?
you deserve better , nadia .
rot in hell .
jesse feeds on ... vampires ?
that &apos;s what doogie said ,
and apparently once he starts , he can &apos;t stop .
hey . um , the fact that he told you this
means that he &apos;s still alive , right ?
as of now .
good . please don &apos;t kill him , damon .
damon , tell me that you won &apos;t kill him .
ok , ok , ok . i won &apos;t kill him .
bye .
problem is i know people like you .
a lot better than you realize .
if i let you live , you &apos;re just gonna do it again .
you &apos;re gonna turn another vampire ,
you &apos;re gonna do another experiment .
the only way to really handle you is just to snuff you out .
you &apos;re lucky i don &apos;t feel like burying a body .
what the hell did you do to me ?
easy there , killer .
wasn &apos;t bad enough that you locked me up and poked me full of needles ?
now i want to feed on the girl i like ?
you feed on monsters , jesse .
in case professor forbes forgot to tell you in your training , sweetie ,
i &apos;m a lot older than you ,
and that means i &apos;m a lot stronger than you .
actually that &apos;s not 100 % accurate .
what the hell did they do to you ?
damon !
jesse , jesse , let go . jesse !
he &apos;s gonna tear my head off .
elena , please .
no ! no !
no , jesse ! jesse , come here .
hold on . hold on .
just stay with me , please .
jesse , just stay with me , please .
no .
what did you do ?
he was gonna kill damon .
but we promised that we would help him .
she didn &apos;t have a choice , all right ?
once he had the taste of vampire blood ,
there was nothing stopping him .
go ask dr. frankenstein .
i &apos;ll go deal with him .
caroline , i &apos;m so sorry . i--
yeah . me , too .
because the elena that i used to know
would have given jesse a chance .
dear nadia ,
sorry i had to kill your boyfriend ,
but it was the motherly thing to do .
suicide , however , not very motherly of me .
i ran from my enemies for 500 years ,
and then one day , i stopped .
now a new enemy wants me dead .
sure i could run from the travelers ,
but there &apos;s still one enemy that i can never escape , time .
so call it pride or vanity ,
but after the life that i &apos;ve led ,
i refuse to drift off into the sunset .
good @-@ bye , nadia .
what are you doing ?
i told you
you either face your problems , or you run .
i chose option 3 .
and what problem has you jumping off of a clock tower ?
i &apos;m dying , stefan .
i &apos;m dying of old age .
i don &apos;t know . the cure did something
to speed up the entire mortifying process .
you &apos;re katherine pierce .
suck it up .
i &apos;ll admit it .
i miss magic .
step away from the candles .
oh , my god .
i think jesse &apos;s dead .
what ?
i &apos;m not ready . i don &apos;t want this .
bonnie , what &apos;s going on ?
bonnie !
what is it ?
i &apos;m the anchor to the other side , jer .
every supernatural being that dies
has to pass through me .
how often does that happen ?
why--why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
i &apos;m back , here , touching you .
we knew there would be consequences .
just kiss me .
what ?
kiss me .
you ... and me ...
this , this is worth it .
any consequence is worth this .
i &apos;m sorry .
i didn &apos;t mean what i said earlier .
it was out of line .
it just sucks , you know ,
cause jesse was one of the good ones .
i know ,
and i wouldn &apos;t have killed him
if i could have done something .
he was dangerous .
i need you to believe that .
i need you to believe me when i tell you that caroline .
i believe you , ok ?
i believe you want to celebrate
the fact that we can go to school
and function like regular freshmen .
i get that . i want that , too ,
but , elena , when are you gonna figure out
that the outside world is not nearly as dangerous as the person
you &apos;re inviting into your own bedroom ?
wow ! why don &apos;t you tell me how you really feel ?
the day that i stop telling you
is the day that we &apos;re no longer best friends ,
and ...
i hope that day never comes .
if you &apos;re gonna do this ,
i &apos;d much rather prefer a bullet through the brain .
actually i &apos;m gonna wait
until i can compel all this out of your head .
what the hell &apos;s that ?
why does this say 12144 ?
what do you care ?
because i was 21051 .
21051 . hang on .
you were an augustine vampire ?
augustine . i haven &apos;t heard that name in decades .
vampire lab rats , coded subject names .
i thought you guys shut down 60 years ago .
you thought wrong .
you know how i said i wasn &apos;t gonna kill you ?
i lied .
atomized vervain .
when working with vampires , you can never be too careful .
i &apos;m sure augustine will be thrilled to have you back .
