you really know him .
i really do .
never ?
no .
why not ?
because you can never go back .
forstman &apos;s insisting that i run the money
through switzerland and the caymans
before it comes out on the other side .
you &apos;re obligated to report it .
i didn &apos;t , and i &apos;m not going to .
what are you talking about ?
rachel , hey--
logan and i kissed .
mike , no , please .
and when i said that it didn &apos;t matter
what i &apos;d do next because i have you ?
i was wrong .
because we &apos;re done .
that &apos;s your fee for putting this deal together .
son of a bitch .
you didn &apos;t bring me here for you to sign on the arrows .
you brought me here for me to sign on the arrows .
yep .
you cannot take a job with that man .
what are you gonna do about it ?
i hired mike ross back at the firm .
what ?
you &apos;re really gonna drop me ?
you &apos;re damn right i am .
i never want to see you again .
are you back here ?
no , i &apos;m going to stay somewhere for a while .
mike--
rachel , whatever you &apos;re going to say ,
now is not the time to say it .
i &apos;m coming back to work tomorrow .
if you can &apos;t accept that ,
then whatever you were going to say to me
won &apos;t matter .
thought you might need this .
thank you .
so , the way i see it , you &apos;ve got three options .
you can wear what you were wearing last night ,
you can go back to your place and change ,
or you can grab anything you want from my closet .
nothing ? i thought for sure you would leap at the chance--
mike &apos;s coming back to work today .
i know .
what am i gonna do ?
you &apos;re gonna do
what you &apos;ve been doing since the day mike left .
you &apos;re gonna walk into harvey &apos;s office with your head held high ,
and you &apos;re gonna do your job .
mike &apos;s job .
rachel--
i don &apos;t know how to be near him without being near him .
i &apos;ll tell you how .
give him space .
i don &apos;t want to give him space .
i want to run to him
and hold him and tell him that i love him .
i know , but , rachel ,
if you try to pull him towards you right now ,
all you &apos;re gonna do is push him away .
trust me . let things be .
they &apos;ll turn out the way they &apos;re supposed to .
you don &apos;t know that .
i do know that .
okay .
rachel , i &apos;m gonna tell you something i &apos;ve never told you .
i slept with harvey .
oh , my god .
but you told me that--
i know what i told you .
it was once , and i never would have done it
if we were still working together .
but then , he left the d.a. &apos; s office ,
and ...
it happened .
and then , the next time i saw him ,
he wanted me to come with him to the firm ,
and i did , and that was that .
would you have wanted a relationship with him ?
i would have wanted to try ,
but he wasn &apos;t ready .
and if i had pushed him to be ready ,
i would be sitting here talking to somebody else
about somebody i used to work with a long time ago .
what are you saying ?
i &apos;m saying everything turned out the way it was supposed to .
but you said the reason
that you two never--is because you can never go back .
i lied .
oh , i &apos;d let you go ,
but i was here first .
words to live by
by harvey specter , the most selfish man in the world .
don &apos;t mind if i do .
wait a second .
what are you doing here so early ?
i always get in this early .
you never get in this early , and i know that for a fact
because this is the time i get in every single day .
you should sleep in once in a while .
it &apos;s good for you . trust me .
i do it every single day .
it just so happens that this morning , i have work to do .
what work ?
the schmoolkinsberg brief .
the schmoolkinsberg brief ?
that &apos;s what you &apos;re going with ?
it &apos;s not gonna write itself .
i &apos;m taking your name off the wall .
seriously , i &apos;m here for the tokyo markets .
name one tokyo market .
the nikkei .
name another .
honda , toyota , kia .
kia &apos;s korean .
yeah , but they &apos;re in the same time zone .
where it is currently dinner .
i &apos;m a tired of this inquisition .
this is exactly why i don &apos;t come in this early .
and the reason that you &apos;re here this early this morning
is because it &apos;s mike ross &apos; first day back .
is it ?
louis , why are you here so early ?
i am taking this forstman document ,
and i am burying it in the bowels of these files .
and then , i am putting these files
deep in the bowels of our storage .
louis , please stop saying bowels .
katrina , i don &apos;t have time to give a shit about bowels ,
&apos;cause after this , we are starting fresh .
and i don &apos;t want to hear about gillis industries , sean cahill ,
charles forstman ever again .
well , look who it is , bonnie and clyde .
just the people i wanted to see .
what do you want , sean ?
to serve you with this .
what the hell is that ?
he wants all files relating to the gillis industries takeover .
oh , i don &apos;t want the files .
i &apos;m taking them .
bullshit .
we have 60 days to fight that or comply .
you want to tell him or should i ?
it &apos;s not a subpoena , harvey . it &apos;s a search warrant .
so you &apos;re gonna give me all the files ,
or you &apos;re gonna head downtown with these two fine gentlemen .
okay , sean .
have it your way .
you &apos;re going to take that hall .
you &apos;re going to run into what appears
to be the mummified remains of a legal secretary .
her name is norma .
mm @-@ hmm .
she &apos;s gonna limp you up to the 60th floor
where you will find 30 years worth of files
that haven &apos;t been sorted since the reagan administration .
or is it the 56th floor ?
it could be the 35th floor for all i know .
the point is , while you &apos;re trying
to find the ark of the covenant ,
we &apos;ll be downtown in front of a judge blocking this bullshit .
you think the threat of you getting to a judge
before i find what i want is gonna get me to leave ?
then stay ,
but who do you think &apos;s gonna get the job done faster ?
you and those two windbreakers or bonnie and clyde .
welcome home , sailor .
you were out to sea a long time .
i was , but now i &apos;m back .
and this place hasn &apos;t changed a bit .
maybe it has .
is this a new spinner &apos;s album ?
no , and you know it &apos;s not new .
you and harvey joked about it .
i could have sworn that was a different one .
said the man with the photographic memory .
okay , that doesn &apos;t mean i &apos;ve seen every album--
you have no idea where to go , do you ?
not a clue .
come with me .
donna , i went to the bullpen .
some guy with a soul patch was sitting at my desk .
that &apos;s because it &apos;s not your desk anymore ,
and you &apos;re not cool enough to pull off a soul patch .
i dispute that .
are you even capable of growing a soul patch ?
i had a goatee my sophomore year of never .
look , it &apos;s not your desk anymore
because you &apos;re on the other side of the bullpen now .
which other side ?
the other side . like , not the side that you were on .
towards the door or away from the door ?
which door are you talking about ?
which door are you talking about ?
you know what ? just shut up and keep walking .
you &apos;re not here five minutes ,
and you &apos;re already a pain in my ass .
this is the other side of the bullpen .
are you serious ?
i know .
i fought it tooth and nail .
i mean , if it were up to me , you &apos;d be setting up shop
in the file room .
you did this , didn &apos;t you ?
well , i didn &apos;t not do it .
thanks , donna .
it &apos;s good to have you back , mike .
well , some of us have work to do ,
and of course , by &quot; some of us , &quot;
i mean you .
as soon as word got out that you were coming back ,
the partners started taking numbers
to give the boy wonder their work .
thanks , donna .
you already thanked me .
not for that .
for not mentioning rachel .
mike .
come on .
you expect me to believe you don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on ?
i know enough to know that it &apos;s between you and her .
shit .
look who &apos;s back .
shit , look who &apos;s still here .
somebody had to pick up your slack
while you were shiting the bed on wall street .
which is why it &apos;s good to be back here
where there &apos;s a shity lawyer like you
to make me look good .
it &apos;s good to see you .
thanks , katrina .
don &apos;t thank me . thank louis .
oh , i did when he hired me back .
i &apos;m sure you did ,
and i &apos;m sure he would never tell you this ,
but i wanted you to know
what he gave up to bring you back here .
what are you talking about ?
jessica gave louis one wish
when he closed forstman ,
and he had a whole plan to manage his work schedule
so he could try to reignite things with sheila .
and he gave all that up because he cared more about you
than he did about himself .
i didn &apos;t know that .
well , like i said ,
i thought you should .
welcome back .
i have court in ten minutes .
now , what are you three doing in front of my face ?
we &apos;re here
because he showed up at our offices this morning
with a search warrant .
a search warrant , i &apos;m sorry to say ,
you have no authority to stop .
yes , you do , because he deliberately
went outside your authority to get it .
what ?
your honor ,
i went to a different judge because my office
tried to reach you , but you were unavailable .
check with your clerk . there &apos;s a record of the call .
did you make it from judge franklin &apos;s house ?
because he &apos;s the one who signed the warrant at 8 : 30 last night .
the same judge you play golf with every thursday .
and barack obama plays basketball with eric holder .
let &apos;s arrest everybody .
i &apos;m not interested in everybody .
i &apos;m interested in why you went around me .
because i needed a warrant last night
to stop them from destroying evidence this morning .
and the day someone &apos;s guilty until proven innocent
is the day that argument holds an ounce of water .
better get your glass , harvey .
that day &apos;s coming sooner than you think .
well , it &apos;s not today .
i &apos;m revoking your search warrant
until we can have a full hearing .
your honor--
now , that &apos;s enough .
if you want to go rummaging around in a law firm &apos;s files ,
you better come to me with more than innuendo .
i better get going .
i have to look up the word &quot; innuendo , &quot;
if you know what i mean .
harvey , i &apos;m telling you , that man is not going to stop coming .
i &apos;m going to suggest something radical here .
and what is that ?
we could just give him what he wants .
the fact is we &apos;ve got nothing to hide .
harvey , i don &apos;t care that we have nothing to hide .
a police officer follows a car long enough ,
he &apos;s gonna find a busted taillight .
and even if he doesn &apos;t , he &apos;s gonna bust it himself .
well , what are you suggesting we do ?
i don &apos;t know , but this whole witch hunt
is about cahill thinking you colluded with mike ross .
so now that he &apos;s back ,
why don &apos;t you collude with that fraud
and get us the hell out of this ?
see you got yourself an office .
yeah , it &apos;s not as nice as the one i had , but--
it &apos;s still a step up .
you mean because it &apos;s smaller or because the view is worse ?
i mean because it &apos;s my old office .
you &apos;re shiting me .
look in the top left drawer .
you &apos;re serious .
i am .
donna said she did this .
she had the idea to give you an office .
it was my idea to give you this office .
and it just happened to be empty .
something like that .
right .
it &apos;s good to have you back where you belong .
okay , enough fun .
sean cahill &apos;s trying to go through every file
we have on the takeover . you in ?
i sure as hell don &apos;t want to do an amicus brief
for paul porter .
good .
then figure out a way to keep cahill
from getting his hands on our documents ,
and do it fast because we don &apos;t have much time .
harvey , have you considered
the fact that he &apos;s been going after us for collusion ,
and we didn &apos;t collude ?
what are you getting at ?
why don &apos;t we just give him all the files ?
we have nothing to hide ,
and fighting him makes it look like we do .
that &apos;s what i said to jessica .
you know what she said to me ?
&quot; a cop follows a car long enough ,
&quot; he &apos;s gonna find a busted taillight .
and even if he doesn &apos;t , he &apos;s gonna bust it himself . &quot;
speaking of jessica ,
you never told me how she felt about me coming back .
find a way to beat cahill , and then ask me that again .
you just had to get to him first , didn &apos;t you ?
what , did you give him a lock of your hair ?
what are you talking about , louis ?
you think i didn &apos;t notice you conveniently
put henderson in my old office
so you can give mike your old office ?
for your information , louis ,
henderson begged for your old office
because he thinks you &apos;re the best attorney
that &apos;s ever walked the face of this earth .
oh , bull--really ?
absolutely .
so you &apos;re not just saying that to butter me up
so i &apos;ll let this go ?
hand to god ,
or as henderson would say ,
&quot; hand to louis . &quot;
okay , then .
just as long as you &apos;re not trying to pull one over on me .
that henderson is going places .
don &apos;t move .
what are you doing ?
taking a mental picture of this moment .
louis , that &apos;s not a mental--
mike ross , the prodigal son , returns .
thanks .
you &apos;re very welcome .
and louis , i want to thank you again for bringing me back .
i &apos;m never gonna forget it .
and if there is every anything that i can do to repay you--
mike , please .
don &apos;t insult me .
you do not owe me , and if you really care about me ,
you will never mention repaying me with a favor again .
really appreciate it , louis .
good .
now , i need you to drop whatever it is you &apos;re doing--
oh , louis , i can &apos;t drop what i &apos;m doing .
harvey just asked me to--
what do you mean you can &apos;t drop what you &apos;re doing ?
i just brought you back here . you owe me .
you just told me never to mention that again .
what , do you think i meant that ?
i said that because that &apos;s what people say .
now , what you say is ,
&quot; screw what harvey asked me to do .
&quot; i don &apos;t give a shit about him .
i only give a shit about you , louis . &quot;
louis , this isn &apos;t just for harvey .
it &apos;s for the firm , okay ?
sean cahill--
bullshit .
that &apos;s just the kind of thing that harvey--
did you just--did you just--
did you just say , &quot; sean cahill &quot; ?
yeah . he &apos;s trying to get access
to our files on the gillis takeover .
why didn &apos;t you say that in the first place ?
we need to fight this son of a bitch
with the full force of the law , mike .
that &apos;s what i was doing .
then , do it .
you don &apos;t have time to work on this case .
i need to bring it to katrina .
louis , are you okay ?
no , i am not okay .
mike , this is an attack on our firm ,
and an attack against one of us is an attack against all of us .
get the hell to work .
we &apos;re in trouble .
sean cahill is trying to get the gillis files .
louis , you buried that document .
you don &apos;t understand .
the sec is gonna have these files forever ,
and eventually , they &apos;re gonna see the money
went in one place and came out the other ,
and i &apos;m the person who did it .
what do you need me to do ?
i want you to cover up my tracks as best you can .
and what are you going to do ?
i &apos;m going to try to fix it so the goddamn thing
never happened in the first place .
what are you doing here ?
i didn &apos;t think we had any further business to discuss .
we don &apos;t . we just have a problem
with the business we just did .
are you here to shake me down for more money ?
i &apos;m here to give it all back .
louis , i told you--
no , just listen to me , okay .
the sec--they &apos;re trying to get access to our files .
that happens , they see
that your payout was routed offshore
and you didn &apos;t pay taxes on it .
they &apos;ll see i haven &apos;t paid taxes .
i have until the third quarter of two years from now
to report that income ,
and if i need to , i will .
are you crazy ?
they &apos;re not idiots .
nobody has money wired through a swiss bank and the caymans
if they &apos;re planning on reporting it to the irs .
that &apos;s not proof of anything ,
and the only thing they &apos;ll definitely find if they get a look at those files
is that you embezzled money .
so get out of my office .
listen to me , goddamn it .
we need to undo this deal .
i tell you what , louis .
have a seat .
you want peace of mind ?
draw up the same paperwork we already signed .
only this time , have harvey sign it instead of you .
what ?
you &apos;re the one who said you &apos;d go to the ends
of the earth to stick it to him .
taking his client is one thing .
framing him for a felony ?
that &apos;s another .
it &apos;s your call .
use your name , replace it with his ,
i don &apos;t give a shit .
but the deal is staying in place .
i heard they hired a new hotshot attorney ,
but they never said how handsome he was .
look , rachel , i &apos;m really swamped right now .
too swamped to even stop by and say , &quot; hello &quot; ?
saying hello is just gonna lead to saying a lot more ,
and now is not the time to have it out .
well , i &apos;m not here to have it out with you .
i am here to work with you on fighting off sean cahill .
i don &apos;t need any help .
but you just said you were swamped .
because i &apos;m trying to avoid having a conversation with you ,
which , obviously , isn &apos;t working .
well , mike , i am harvey &apos;s associate now .
so you working a case with him , you &apos;re working it with me .
he didn &apos;t say anything to me about it .
well , he said it to me .
why do you think i &apos;m here ?
i don &apos;t care what he said . it &apos;s not a good idea .
what isn &apos;t ? for us to even be in the same room together ?
not right now . no .
you &apos;re the one who chose to come back here .
so ?
so you don &apos;t get
to act disappointed that i work here too .
rachel . listen to me .
i told you that i needed space .
what do you call staying in a hotel ?
based on this conversation ,
i call it a smart move .
okay , mike , i &apos;m sorry .
where are you going ?
get some air .
they hire you back after helping them break the law ,
and this is what they give you for lunch ?
you wouldn &apos;t ask that if you &apos;d ever had
one of these bagels .
maybe not , but let me ask you this .
you remember that game show called let &apos;s make a deal ?
not interested .
you haven &apos;t heard what &apos;s in it for you .
i don &apos;t need to hear what &apos;s in it for me
because i know what &apos;s in it for you .
you &apos;re a smart kid .
i see why they wanted you back .
i &apos;m gonna get back to my bagel , which is gonna
taste so much better when i &apos;m not looking at you .
all right , before you gobble that up , think about this .
sooner or later , i &apos;m gonna get those files .
but there &apos;s nothing to stop you from giving them to me
all on your own .
if you do that ,
any of those files that say &quot; mike ross , &quot;
i &apos;ll replace with &quot; anonymous former employee . &quot;
that would be tempting , sean ,
if i actually had something to hide .
oh , i do have one more question , though .
is harvey footing the bill ?
what ?
for your room at the soho grand .
that &apos;s where you &apos;re staying , right ?
you should try the cobb salad .
it &apos;s out of this world .
guess who just got propositioned
by a striking blonde ?
please tell me it was kate upton .
isn &apos;t she a little young for you ?
last night , she told me i was the perfect age .
to be her father .
when are you gonna understand
they all want a daddy , mike ?
you want to talk about cahill or just
keep bragging about things that never actually happened .
what did cahill want ?
it &apos;s not what he wanted .
it &apos;s what he gave me .
well , let &apos;s have it .
son of a bitch knew i was staying at a hotel .
what are you getting at ?
didn &apos;t you say
he sidestepped judge hopkins to get a search warrant
for our files ?
you &apos;re thinking he went around hopkins
to get authorization to follow us ?
i &apos;m thinking he never got authorization at all .
then we need to get a list
of the sec &apos;s requests for surveillance by tomorrow .
i have a friend at justice .
since when ?
okay , i don &apos;t , but i thought it sounded cool .
mike , this is serious .
we need that list , and we need it by tomorrow .
on it .
good news , louis .
i not only misfiled and misdated that document ,
i added in 10,000 others that look just like it .
that thing is as buried as it &apos;s ever going to be .
what the hell difference does it make ?
it &apos;s all for nothing .
what happened with forstman ?
what do you think ?
he didn &apos;t go for it .
no , something else happened because
you wouldn &apos;t be this upset if he just turned you down .
he wouldn &apos;t undo anything ,
but he is willing to let me pin the whole thing on harvey .
how could you even do that ?
oh , i don &apos;t know .
make up a new document , forge his signature .
doesn &apos;t matter &apos; cause i &apos;m not gonna do it .
louis--
katrina , enough .
you did good work , but the truth is ,
if we have to turn over those files ,
they find that transaction .
i &apos;m gonna end up in prison .
then you and i
better figure out a way to make sure
harvey wins that motion .
okay .
don &apos;t you have a funny way
of giving someone space .
what ?
not only did you do exactly what we talked about not doing ,
but you lied , and you used harvey &apos;s name to do it .
i am sorry .
no , sorry &apos;s not good enough .
this is the second time we &apos;ve had this conversation recently ,
and i want to know why the hell we &apos;re having it again .
i didn &apos;t mean to lie .
i just--i went to mike to talk--
that &apos;s my point .
you couldn &apos;t even make it through one day ?
i thought that i could .
and then , i saw him sitting there , and i just--
rachel , just because something &apos;s hard to do
doesn &apos;t mean that you can &apos;t do it .
okay . i shouldn &apos;t have brought harvey into it .
but i am not going to apologize for talking to mike
because he and i aren &apos;t the same as you and harvey .
excuse me ?
that didn &apos;t come out that i--
i did not tell you that
for you to just throw it back in my face .
i didn &apos;t mean to throw it in your face .
i respect that you let things take their natural course .
but i want to make things work with mike ,
and the only way i know how to do that is to fight for him .
fight for him all you want ,
but don &apos;t lie about harvey ever again .
you &apos;re missing it in here already ?
just passing through .
i lied to you .
i know you lied to me--
not that .
harvey never assigned me to your case .
i did it because you left our home ,
and you came here .
and all i can think every time i look at you
is how sorry i am .
and the reason i want you to leave me alone
is all i can think when i look at you
is him .
then why did you come back ?
i was drowning , and louis threw me a lifeline .
i &apos;m your lifeline , too .
a lifeline ? you &apos;re the one that threw me overboard .
mike--
and why did it have to be him ?
i don &apos;t need you to keep telling me that you &apos;re sorry
or to be charming or anything else .
i just need to get that image out of my head .
did you get it ?
no .
a little heads up would have been nice .
i don &apos;t exactly have a backup plan .
well , good thing i do .
what are you talking about ?
it doesn &apos;t matter whether we have proof of our theory or not .
it just matters whether or not our theory is true .
you typed up a fake list .
exactly . brilliant .
it would have been a little more brilliant
if you didn &apos;t get here at the last second .
it wouldn &apos;t work if it doesn &apos;t look real , and that takes time .
okay , just give it to me .
i got it .
oh , well , well .
if it isn &apos;t the wonder twins .
form of &quot; douche bag . &quot;
shape of &quot; got you by the balls . &quot;
no , no , no , no . it &apos;s got to be an animal .
i don &apos;t care what it has to be .
what that is , is every surveillance request
from the sec in the last three months .
mike , why don &apos;t you tell him what &apos;s on there ?
oh , he knows what &apos;s on there and what &apos;s not on there ,
which would be me and you .
wait a second , doesn &apos;t that make any evidence
he &apos;s planning on using today inadmissible ?
i believe it would .
save yourself the embarrassment , sean .
withdraw your request for a warrant ,
a subpoena , or anything .
all right . let &apos;s get this thing going .
what are you two doing at his table ?
you want to tell him or should we ?
your honor , i am formally withdrawing my request
to go through their files .
then , why are we all here ?
because i want it to be on the record
that logan sanders requests the release
of all communications between these two gentlemen on his behalf .
what ?
you heard me .
your honor , how do we know that signature isn &apos;t fabricated ?
go ahead .
give mr. sanders a call .
he &apos;ll tell you it &apos;s true .
because unlike you , he was more than happy
to sign the request in exchange for immunity .
pending verification of this signature ,
you are to give him everything he asks for immediately .
your honor .
i told you i &apos;d get those files sooner or later .
guess it &apos;s gonna be sooner .
what &apos;s that ?
it &apos;s 50 different ways we can stop sean cahill in his tracks .
why did you--
i told you .
an attack on one of us is an attack on all of us .
harvey is my brother , and if cahill &apos;s coming after him ,
he is coming after me .
louis , it doesn &apos;t matter .
there &apos;s nothing we can do about it .
what do you mean there &apos;s nothing we can do about it ?
logan sanders cut a deal with cahill .
we have to release all communications
between me and harvey on gillis .
just between you and harvey ? that &apos;s it ?
none of the forstman stuff ?
that &apos;s it .
thank god . we &apos;re in the clear .
louis , one second ago , you said that an attack on harvey
was an attack on you .
yeah , yeah , yeah .
and you just said there &apos;s nothing we can do about it .
but that doesn &apos;t make it a good thing .
doesn &apos;t it ?
what are you--
mike , did you collude with harvey or not ?
of course i didn &apos;t .
that &apos;s exactly my point ,
so as far as i &apos;m concerned , this matter is done .
guess what this is ?
louis , i was never really a star trek fan .
it &apos;s the resting heart rate of a happy man .
it &apos;s over ?
we &apos;re sending them files ,
but we &apos;re not sending them our files .
i don &apos;t understand .
logan sanders signed a deal ,
blah , blah , blah .
they &apos;re not getting the forstman document .
and that &apos;s the end ?
that &apos;s the end .
congratulations , louis .
thank you , katrina .
you know what ,
why don &apos;t take the rest of the day off and check out
that mummenschanz retrospective
i &apos;ve been telling you about .
thank you , louis , though i may do something else .
suit yourself , but i &apos;m telling you right now .
it &apos;s a game changer .
they--
am i to understand logan sanders waived privilege ?
yeah , it &apos;s his right .
goddamn it , harvey .
you never should have cut that man loose as a client .
well , i cut him loose because i knew
he was the kind of person who would do what he just did .
bullshit . you cut him loose
because you knew mike ross was coming back here .
well , you &apos;re damn right i did .
i &apos;m not gonna apologize for it .
you should have discussed it with me first .
well , it &apos;s easier to ask for forgiveness than permission .
forgiveness ?
you just said you &apos;re not going to apologize for it .
you know what ? i &apos;m not ,
because i don &apos;t want to hear a lecture
on the amount of billings his company brought in .
you mean the $ 20 million going back over two decades .
i don &apos;t give a shit if it &apos;s $ 100 million .
you want to have it out over which clients we keep ,
i &apos;m happy to .
but in this case , i made a call ,
and you &apos;re either gonna back me or you &apos;re not .
we need to stop fighting .
excuse me ?
we &apos;re not fighting .
yes , we are .
i &apos;m not talking about you two .
then what the hell are you talking about ?
cahill .
you want us to give in ?
no . i &apos;m saying he wants all the files ,
let &apos;s give him all the files .
rachel , what are you doing here ?
i told you needed some time .
and then you told me that you needed to get that image
out of your head .
which is why i need--
no . no , it isn &apos;t .
because you &apos;ll never completely get it out of your head .
tess .
yes , tess .
and my image isn &apos;t made up , and ...
it wasn &apos;t of two people kissing .
but i got over it without getting rid of it because
forgiveness doesn &apos;t work that way .
you knew how i felt about him .
you knew what it would do to me , and you did it anyway .
and i told you i made a mistake .
what do you want from me , rachel ?
i want you to decide
if you love me more than you hate what i did .
and if you don &apos;t ,
then i want you to tell me that it &apos;s over .
and if you do ,
then i want you to come home .
afternoon , sean .
well , you &apos;re in a good mood for a man
who keeps getting his ass kicked .
well , at a certain point , you get tired of fighting .
well , i wouldn &apos;t know ,
but after this , we can grab a beer ,
and you can tell me what it &apos;s like to be a loser .
your honor .
mr. specter ,
you better be here to hand over your clients files .
i &apos;m here to do more than that .
we &apos;re handing over all of the files
in the gillis industries takeover ,
but i want the court to catalog every piece of paper in there
so sean doesn &apos;t &quot; find one &quot;
that was never there in the first place .
isn &apos;t this what you were arguing against from day one ?
we changed our minds because we have nothing to hide .
no , no . this is a ploy .
he &apos;s trying to get me on record stating that we have everything ,
and if i find nothing ,
he &apos;s gonna file malicious prosecution charges .
actually , sean ,
i &apos;m filing those charges right now .
and when you don &apos;t find anything in the contents
of everything you ever asked for ,
this bullshit search becomes exhibit a.
your honor , he has no basis to file that action .
i can &apos;t stop the man from giving you
exactly what you were in here asking me for two days ago .
now , are you gonna proceed under threat
the malicious prosecution or not ?
what &apos;s the matter , sean ?
afraid you won &apos;t find anything ?
just give me the files .
you wanted to see me ?
i wanted to give credit where credit is due .
cahill went for it .
yes ,
and when he finds nothing , we &apos;ll be done with him .
good job .
thank you .
and thank you for taking me back ,
especially since i know you didn &apos;t want to .
would you have wanted to if you were me ?
i did just come up with that fix .
a fix for cahill coming after you for colluding with harvey ?
a problem i never would have had
if i &apos;d never met you .
why &apos;d you call me down here ?
i want to know why the hell you came back .
you know , it &apos;s funny . if you &apos;d asked me that this morning ,
i would have said because i had no place else to go .
i didn &apos;t ask you this morning .
i &apos;m asking you now .
then it doesn &apos;t matter why i came back .
what matters is that i &apos;m staying
because this is where i belong .
hey , just the person i was looking for .
you heard ?
i heard that i just
booked a plane ticket to boston
to surprise sheila ,
and i need you to cover the mcbain hearing tomorrow .
louis , the mcbain hearing is the least of our worries .
what do you mean ?
harvey went to court this morning
and agreed to hand over
every single document on the gillis takeover ,
including forstman .
what ? why would--
because he thinks we have nothing to hide .
shit . then it &apos;s only a matter of time
before i &apos;m marched out of here in handcuffs .
i &apos;m not gonna let it come to that .
oh , how the hell are you gonna stop it ?
by replacing one document with another .
i am not framing harvey .
this isn &apos;t framing harvey .
it &apos;s freeing you .
what are you talking about ?
this makes it look like forstman &apos;s payment never
went to any offshore accounts
and that you never took a piece of it .
no , that &apos;s forgery .
which is less of a crime than what you did .
i didn &apos;t ask you to do this .
then don &apos;t use it ,
but you &apos;re the one who said that if we give them those files ,
it &apos;s only a matter of time .
louis , cahill &apos;s looking for dirt on harvey and mike ,
not you and forstman .
he won &apos;t even give this a second glance .
but if he does , it puts harvey in jeopardy ,
and i might as well frame him just like forstman wanted me to .
then you have a decision to make
because they &apos;re turning everything over first thing tomorrow .
louis , is everything okay ?
yeah , everything &apos;s fine , mike .
donna ?
what can i do for you , harvey ?
everything taken care of for the file transfer tomorrow ?
it was taken care of 20 minutes before you asked for it .
great . here &apos;s howard , miller , and klein .
i &apos;d like to get a jump on these right now .
oh , it &apos;s late , harvey . we &apos;ve had a long day .
maybe we can just--
come on .
we can order from that shity thai place you love .
knock this out in two hours .
is that an order or a request ?
what are you--
i have a date tonight , harvey ,
so unless you think we &apos;re gonna lose
howard , miller , or klein ,
i &apos;m leaving .
have a good night .
thanks , harvey .
don &apos;t forget to use protection--
stop right there .
oh , so when i go out with someone ,
you can give me all the shit in the world ,
but when you do--
yep . that &apos;s exactly how it works .
get used to it .
what &apos;s wrong with you ? you look like you just saw a ghost .
i feel like i did .
i think we have a problem .
what do you mean ?
we just took step number one
to finally putting this cahill bullshit behind us .
yeah , that &apos;s what i &apos;m saying . i don &apos;t think it is behind us .
what ?
i don &apos;t know what louis did ,
but i think he did something wrong .
what are you talking about ?
when he came to me yesterday , he was chomping at the bit
to help fight cahill .
that &apos;s louis .
he &apos;d take a bullet for this firm , you know that .
then why did he immediately change his tune
after i told him that
logan was only releasing our communications ?
he seemed relieved ?
he seemed ecstatic ,
and before that ,
he was pissed that i was working on your stuff
until he found out it was to fight cahill .
what exactly are you thinking he might have done ?
i don &apos;t know exactly ,
but i think he cut some sort of deal with forstman .
he did cut a deal with forstman .
i &apos;m talking about an illegal deal .
mike , i know forstman &apos;s a snake ,
but this is louis you &apos;re talking about .
i know , but you weren &apos;t there when he made me that offer .
i &apos;d never seen him like that .
he was desperate to keep me from working for &quot; that man . &quot;
mike--
and then on top of that ,
i found out what he gave up to get me back here .
sheila .
but why would he care about us handling over everything
if he didn &apos;t care about the communications between us ?
because if he did make a dirty deal with forstman ,
it wouldn &apos;t have been in those documents .
it would have been in the other documents .
the documents we just told the court
we &apos;re happy to turn over .
what are you gonna do ?
i &apos;m gonna find out what the hell louis did .
go home , mike .
there &apos;s nothing you can do tonight .
i made a huge mistake .
