第五集
don &apos;t do it , emma .
how do you know my name ?
i know many things .
and i &apos;m here to tell you , leave the sword alone .
i would do anything for my kingdom .
which is why i need you to drink this .
your death will be the cornerstone of a great new kingdom .
we can &apos;t trust arthur .
pity your husband didn &apos;t listen
when you tried to warn him .
turns out david was right .
we can trust arthur .
you could just set me free .
the only one who can get me that sword is you .
i @-@ i can &apos;t .
多年前
dark one ?
dark one !
enough !
i command you to stop !
you destroyed her .
the only woman i ever loved .
and now ...
i will destroy you .
my god .
i miss her .
you really think giving the dagger to arthur
is the best way to help emma ?
we trust him .
implicitly .
did you learn those big words at shepherd school ?
how do you know you can trust him ?
because we &apos;re good judges of character .
and we would never act against emma &apos;s best interest .
is the dagger in there ?
are you sure
handing the one thing that can control your daughter
over to arthur is the right thing to do ?
have you lost the power of comprehension ?
hand over the da--
what are you doing ?
when did you get so liberal with dark magic ?
no choice .
arthur has them under some kind of spell .
he wants them to bring him the dagger .
he wants to reunite it with excalibur .
unite it ?
it was once one blade .
it was broken in half a long , long time ago .
what happens when they &apos;re together ?
he wants to kill merlin with it .
i don &apos;t have to tell you how bad that would be for all of us .
how do you know this ?
how do i know this isn &apos;t the darkness in you
rearing its head ?
it &apos;s true .
we don &apos;t have a lot of time . arthur &apos;s expecting them soon .
he &apos;s the king .
so you want to take on all of camelot ?
i want to free merlin first .
then i can help my parents and stop arthur .
that &apos;s a great plan , but we have no idea
how to get him out of the tree .
you already said it ...
dark magic .
no .
you can &apos;t keep using it .
it &apos;s a risk i &apos;m willing to take .
careful , emma .
i &apos;ve been on that slippery slope .
you know where it got me .
all due respect ...
i &apos;m not you .
so he just ... vanished ?
could it be magic ?
your squire ... did he wield such power ?
not that i ever saw .
well , there &apos;s no sign of tampering .
then he must have lied about having the bean .
must &apos;ve hidden it on his person somewhere and used it to escape .
how could he be so selfish ?
we could all be home right now .
desperate times .
our people want so badly to return .
we must do something to raise their spirits .
the despair of being away ... that &apos;s what caused all this .
who knows what else it can lead to ?
well , you &apos;re right ... people need hope .
and as your hosts and leaders of this town ,
it is up to us to provide it .
what do you have in mind ?
how about a dance ?
a dance , huh ?
looking for an excuse
to ask your girlfriend out on a date ?
girlfriend ? what girlfriend ?
she &apos;s not my girlfriend .
who &apos;s not your girlfriend ?
i think a dance is exactly what we need .
henry , who &apos;s this girlfriend ?
well , if it &apos;s dating tips you need , lad ,
i know my way around women .
over your dead body .
regina ! let &apos;s start planning .
i think it is time storybrooke had a ball .
so , who is this girlfriend ?
what do you know about her ?
belle . what is it ?
it &apos;s , uh , it &apos;s rumple .
what happened ?
he &apos;s missing .
better eat up .
you &apos;re gonna need your strength
if you &apos;re going to remove the sword .
i won &apos;t be able to do it now .
you should really just let me go .
please .
i @-@ i need to see belle .
you &apos;re not going anywhere until you get me my sword .
well , you have so much power . w @-@ w @-@ why do you need excalibur ?
tell me , when you were the dark one ,
did you advertise your plans ?
my plans were always hidden .
but my reasons were not .
every time i used magic ,
i told myself it was all for my son ...
to protect him .
how noble .
despite my best intentions ...
i still lost him .
i &apos;m stronger than you were .
well , that ...
that really doesn &apos;t matter .
the more you justify what you &apos;re doing ,
the more you push them away .
and take it from me ...
you will always lose the ones you love the most .
merida .
yes , dark one ?
get him out of my sight . take him to the woods and begin .
how long do you think you can hold my heart and threaten me ?
as long as it takes me to get what i want .
maybe .
but i &apos;m thinking i can break your spell !
now take him to the woods ...
and make me a hero .
first , we need to know
how the potion you &apos;ve been working on
will react to my dark magic .
bring me the vial .
i &apos;m not doing a damn thing until you tell me how you knew
david and mary margaret were under a spell .
we don &apos;t have time for this .
make time .
fine .
i saw it in this ...
a dreamcatcher .
emma , this is dark magic .
i know .
these things catch more than dreams .
i know .
and you have to wave it over someone to capture a memory .
i don &apos;t .
this dark magic is stronger ,
more unpredictable than any magic i &apos;ve ever used .
the image just appeared .
it showed me what arthur did to them .
look , it &apos;s gonna be okay .
the dreamcatcher also showed me
a memory that &apos;s going to help us .
merlin &apos;s .
i saw him .
merlin wept for the loss of the only woman he ever loved
moments before the dark one trapped him in the tree ...
using one of his tears .
emma , that &apos;s it .
sometimes , spells are like snakebites .
you can make the antivenom with the venom .
if a tear of lost love trapped merlin ...
then another one might be able to get him out .
so , what do you say ?
let &apos;s go get ourselves a tear .
so , how long have you had nicodemus ?
my mother gave him to me for my seventh birthday .
she was a champion rider .
but , um ... she passed away
before i even learned to gallop .
my dad died before i really got the chance to know him .
there &apos;s just so much i wish i could tell him .
you know ?
yes .
i do know .
i &apos;ve never met anyone i could talk to about this before .
i should put nico &apos;s saddle away .
i &apos;ll be right back .
what &apos;s that , lady violet ?
if i pull excalibur from this stone ,
i will be forever your hero ?
what is going on in here ?
you &apos;re one of those visitors , aren &apos;t you ?
from the other land .
ah , yes .
you &apos;re the one who &apos;s been running around with my daughter .
henry .
you &apos;re violet &apos;s father ?
you may address me as &quot; sir morgan . &quot;
how old are you , boy ?
13 , sir .
and no skills with a sword or a horse ?
what sort of squire are you ?
i &apos;m ... i &apos;m not a squire , sir .
i &apos;m a writer .
a writer .
tell me , boy ...
when this kingdom is attacked by ogres ,
will you protect my daughter with your pen ?
violet belongs with someone who will become a knight ,
a hero who understands this world ...
someone like her .
now get out of here before you cause any more damage .
did you see my text ?
about the block party .
yes .
everything okay ?
i &apos;m afraid i &apos;m not in the mood for parties .
my horse ran off this morning .
oh ... oh , no .
did you check the stables ?
he &apos;s gone .
my father &apos;s out right now
trying to lure nico with some pumpkin .
it &apos;s his favorite treat .
it &apos;s okay . he &apos;ll come back .
the town isn &apos;t that big .
maybe tonight will help you get your mind off of it .
henry , i can &apos;t go dancing or go to a party
or anything ... not while he &apos;s still out there .
i &apos;m gonna find your horse , violet .
and i know just the person to help .
do you remember why i first brought you to storybrooke ?
of course ... operation cobra .
bring back all the happy endings .
well , your mission isn &apos;t over .
henry , things are different now .
they don &apos;t have to be .
show me that the mom i know is still in there somewhere .
she is . this is me .
then prove it .
help me return my friend &apos;s happy ending .
don &apos;t think about running . with that limp ,
you wouldn &apos;t make it 10 feet .
pick up the bloody sword and let &apos;s make a hero of you .
but i @-@ i can barely stand , much less fight someone .
now you can stand .
all a man needs is a sword and one good hand .
you &apos;ve got both , so pick it up .
look , t @-@ this is useless .
if she wants me to pull excalibur ,
then-- then let me try .
when i fail , she can move on .
when you fail , there &apos;s no moving on . you turn to dust .
what do you care what happens to me ?
i don &apos;t ! i care what happens to me !
and my brothers and my kingdom --
none of which i can help while this goes on .
so whether you like it or not , you &apos;re going to get me home .
i can never be brave .
me whole fate rests in a coward &apos;s hands .
it &apos;s really come to this ?
yes , you will be . you have to .
you have the wrong man .
well , if words won &apos;t drive you ,
we &apos;ll have to figure another way , now , won &apos;t we ?
there has to be something .
and i &apos;m gonna find it .
so , the horse likes pumpkin , huh ?
yeah . violet &apos;s dad is out trying to lure it with some .
back in my bail @-@ bondsperson days ,
i caught a guy because he loved pizza ,
but i didn &apos;t walk around
randomly holding a slice of pepperoni .
there is a better way .
i &apos;ve missed this -- us .
operation cobra .
me too .
so , tell me about you and violet .
she &apos;s okay .
we like some of the same stuff .
like what ?
i played her some music , and she was into it .
what did you play ?
yaz .
what song ?
&quot; only you . &quot;
did your dad teach you that move ?
he said it always works .
did with me .
he loved that song .
it &apos;s a good song .
yeah , it is .
okay .
let &apos;s get your girl &apos;s horse .
i have a good idea where to start .
henry ! careful .
moms .
i was , uh ... getting in the camelot spirit .
you know -- trying to understand this world .
by swordfighting ?
w @-@ well , sir morgan , violet &apos;s father ,
had a little advice for me to fit in .
that &apos;s all .
trouble is , i &apos;m not sure
if i &apos;m ever gonna be good at this knight stuff .
well , if you &apos;re not , you &apos;re not ,
but ...
changing so someone likes you never works .
i mean , i ...
i liked your dad because he was always himself .
but-- but maybe , if i try ,
i could be something better than i am .
if you didn &apos;t change for the better ,
you wouldn &apos;t be with robin .
true .
but do you really think a girl from camelot
would be interested in someone
who &apos;s just like every other boy around here ?
remember when i told you about daniel ?
yeah . your first love .
and it wasn &apos;t because he tried to impress me
by being like the others .
it was because he was so different ...
so unique .
henry , in camelot ,
you &apos;re a mysterious stranger from an exotic land .
that &apos;s a good thing .
i think i can work with that .
thanks .
i have to go make a few arrangements .
emma .
i think i might know where to get
our missing ingredient to free merlin .
from me .
all right , regina . this is going to be intense .
last chance to back out .
i can take it .
look into the circle .
so , this is your decision ?
this will make you happy ?
it already has .
then who am i to stop you ?
thank you , mother .
daniel .
if you want to have a life together , a family ,
then there &apos;s one important lesson i can impart on you .
it &apos;s what it means to be a parent .
you always have to do what &apos;s best for your children .
mother !
no !
no !
i &apos;m sorry .
it was like it was happening all over again .
got it .
thank you .
i didn &apos;t know how things were for you .
i ... didn &apos;t know ...
you could see it , too ?
i &apos;m so sorry .
i don &apos;t understand how a mother could do something like that .
she thought it was for the best .
showtime .
henry says he &apos;s got emma occupied .
you told henry what we &apos;re doing ?
no , but he &apos;ll let us know when she &apos;s headed back .
let &apos;s do this .
you okay ?
protection spell .
it would appear she doesn &apos;t want you trespassing .
you want to try , pirate ?
well , i know she doesn &apos;t want me to .
henry .
she &apos;d let henry in .
do you have anything of his on you ?
i do now .
thank you , henry .
you &apos;re our hero .
uh ... hi , m &apos;lady .
i mean , uh , violet .
i mean ...
p @-@ please sit down .
thank you .
i was really happy to get your note .
i was worried when you disappeared from the stables .
you were ?
yes .
you wanted me to worry ?
yes .
i mean , no .
i mean ... are you thirsty ?
sure .
is that magic ?
no .
it &apos;s soda .
here .
it &apos;s like a carnival in a can .
so , uh , this is granny &apos;s .
it &apos;s pretty great .
she had some lasagna in the fridge that didn &apos;t go bad ,
so i was able to heat it up .
you really are from another world .
is -- is that okay ?
yeah , it &apos;s great .
so , i thought after dinner , we could watch a movie .
it &apos;s easier if i show you .
on my phone .
the screen &apos;s small , but here -- look .
if i &apos;d known i was coming , i would &apos;ve loaded more ,
but i brought &quot; commando &quot; and &quot; harold and maude . &quot;
we &apos;ll do &quot; harold and maude . &quot; it &apos;s a good date movie , i think .
a date ?
what &apos;s that ?
it &apos;s , uh ...
never mind .
are you ...
courting me ?
maybe .
you &apos;re sweet .
but ...
oh , no .
i just don &apos;t think i feel the same way about you as you do me .
your father told you what happened , didn &apos;t he ?
what ?
no .
i mean , yes , he did mention he met you ,
but no , that &apos;s not it .
he doesn &apos;t think i &apos;m a hero .
well , i am .
henry , please ...
listen , i @-@ i thought we were
just spending time together as -- as friends .
and ... i liked it better that way .
i &apos;m sorry .
there we go .
that &apos;ll do .
mom , this is genius !
yeah , when the first curse ended ,
this peter guy opened this place .
i wouldn &apos;t have known about it ,
but it got so many noise complaints .
guess &quot; peter peter &quot; likes his parties .
hadn &apos;t thought of it till you mentioned the pumpkins , though .
violet wasn &apos;t kidding .
look !
would you look at that .
come on .
careful , henry . i got this .
mom , i guess you need to step back
and let me handle this .
i didn &apos;t do anything .
you &apos;re the dark one . now get back .
henry ...
it &apos;s okay . i got it .
it &apos;s okay , nicodemus .
come here , boy .
it &apos;s okay , nicodemus . come here , boy .
come here .
yeah . here you go .
see ?
told ya .
now that you &apos;ve got your girl &apos;s horse ,
don &apos;t you have a dance to get to ?
now we know why she didn &apos;t want you down here .
indeed .
i don &apos;t think she wants anyone to see this ,
and i think i know the reason why .
take a gander .
excalibur looks quite familiar .
the dagger .
it &apos;s the -- the same design , the same edges .
what the hell does she want with this ?
and with gold . what is she up to ?
well , given our missing memories ,
i &apos;d wager whatever it is , it &apos;s not good .
let &apos;s take a better look at the damn thing and find out .
stop !
i can &apos;t believe i &apos;m about to say this ,
but it could be booby @-@ trapped .
you could get killed .
oh . i didn &apos;t know you cared .
i don &apos;t .
but right now , you &apos;re useful ...
ish .
he was here .
rumple was here .
and now he &apos;s gone .
let &apos;s try searching the rest of the house .
no time . it &apos;s henry .
she &apos;s on her way back .
hey . what are you doing ?
what the hell is that ?
it &apos;s a dreamcatcher .
baelfire gave her one similar to this a long time ago .
but this , it &apos;s different .
wait a minute . why would she have it ?
because they can be more than just objects of folklore .
when imbued with magic , they can be quite powerful .
i think i know how emma took our memories .
go on , emma . do it .
arthur could be here any second .
and now for the final ingredient --
the tear .
it should &apos;ve worked .
it should have worked !
regina ...
it &apos;s simple .
your heartbreak wasn &apos;t strong enough .
what ? !
no , no , i know it was real .
but there &apos;s robin now .
you &apos;ve moved on . you &apos;ve healed .
sorry i &apos;m late .
henry , are you okay ?
yeah , i &apos;m -- i &apos;m fine .
no , you &apos;re not .
what happened ? henry ?
i don &apos;t want to talk about it .
you can tell us anything .
i tried doing what you said .
i tried acting like myself .
but she didn &apos;t want anything to do with me .
henry .
violet &apos;s right .
in this world , i &apos;ll never be a hero .
you may not be a hero in her world ...
but you will be in ours .
this &apos;ll work .
this tear .
your tear , henry .
it can free merlin ?
you can save me , kid .
stop !
stay away from the tree .
i won &apos;t ask twice .
you and your people have done nothing but lie to me
ever since you got here .
you &apos;re no savior . you &apos;re a fraud .
go ahead .
call me a fraud again . i dare you .
we welcomed you -- celebrated you .
and in return ,
you bring the dark one into the heart of my kingdom ,
endangering all who live here .
give me the dagger !
you want it ?
come and get it .
now , emma .
it &apos;s working !
charge !
i &apos;ve been waiting for you ...
... emma .
and you --
the boy who would be king .
my great hope .
how you &apos;ve disappointed me .
i disappointed you ?
you gave me false prophecies .
sent me on an impossible quest !
you ruined my life !
put it away , arthur .
we both know that broken sword can &apos;t hurt me .
this is not finished .
she had excalibur ?
trapped in a stone in her basement .
well , then we need to get it back at once .
it would be disastrous if the dark one took possession of it .
that have anything to do
with its striking resemblance to the dark one dagger ?
how do you know about the dagger ?
i &apos;ve spent a lifetime trying to end the dark one &apos;s existence .
i know much about the dagger .
what i don &apos;t know about is your blade .
care to enlighten us ?
yes .
there &apos;s a reason they resemble each other .
they were forged as one weapon and then broken in two .
i &apos;ve spent years trying to reunite them .
that &apos;s why you were so interested in the dagger
when you arrived .
i apologize for not telling you sooner ,
but i had to make sure i could trust you .
the restored weapon has great power .
it can eradicate all dark magic forever .
that &apos;s a good thing .
of course .
but in the wrong hands , it can also destroy all light magic .
that &apos;s their plan .
to snuff out the light forever .
what happened in camelot ?
how did emma fall so far ?
just try to have some fun tonight , okay ?
henry .
henry , you did it .
well done , lad .
well done .
henry , this is my father , sir morgan .
father , this is henry .
you &apos;ve made my daughter very happy .
we owe you a great deal of thanks .
it was nothing , sir .
heroic and humble .
you &apos;re a good man , henry .
you &apos;ll make a fine knight someday .
thank you , sir .
now , you two --
enjoy the festivities .
thank you , henry .
glad to see the bears didn &apos;t get ya .
please .
please . i @-@ i -- i can &apos;t fight .
no . you won &apos;t fight . big difference .
you know , my father used to say , &quot; if you want a lad to fight ,
give him something to fight for . &quot;
w @-@ what are you doing ?
reminding you what you have to fight for .
where did you get that ?
oh , means something to you , doesn &apos;t it ?
if you want it , you &apos;re gonna have to fight me for it .
oh ! i see it &apos;s chipped , eh ?
must be fragile .
we wouldn &apos;t want to drop it , now , would we ?
no , please . please don &apos;t . don &apos;t .
so , what happened ?
did your belle see the yellow @-@ bellied man you really are ?
i bet you she did , didn &apos;t she ?
ooh ! that had to sting !
oh ! did you feel that ?
feel what ?
that swing right there !
you weren &apos;t thinking of yourself or the limp .
you were thinking of her .
that was an act of true bravery .
ready to try again ?
good !
because we &apos;ve got a long way to go
before you &apos;re ready to take on emma .
if emma used this to rip our memories ,
maybe it can tell us what happened in camelot .
well , what are we waiting for ?
you &apos;re afraid of what you might see , aren &apos;t you ?
emma clearly thought she had good reason for what she did .
who knows what happened to us there ?
there &apos;s only one way to find out .
i &apos;m violet .
henry .
are these henry &apos;s memories ?
no .
no , i think it &apos;s that girl he has a crush on .
我会给你一个惊喜 亨利
violet .
can you keep a secret ?
of course .
good .
because henry can never know about this .
violet , listen .
you will get this back . i just need your help first .
w @-@ w @-@ what do you need ?
i need the tear of a lost first love -- a fresh tear .
i need you to break henry &apos;s heart .
henry .
there .
that should do it .
emma .
we &apos;re so sorry .
if we would &apos;ve known how bad it was ,
we would never confronted him on our own .
it &apos;s okay . i &apos;m just glad merlin could help .
merlin ?
y @-@ you &apos;re ... merlin ?
expecting someone ...
older .
yes .
well , let &apos;s just say that being a tree --
good for your skin .
well , now that the great sorcerer is among us ,
maybe he &apos;ll tell us .
can you do what your apprentice said ?
can you free emma from the darkness ?
sure .
but with a caveat .
darkness like this takes a hold of a person ,
find its way deep inside , where nobody else can see .
so if i am to free you from its grasp ,
i must know one thing .
emma , is your heart truly ready to be free ?
because it is as much up to you as me .
emma .
hello .
what the hell is going on ? what are you doing ?
i &apos;m here to see henry .
you know that &apos;s not what i mean .
you took our memories , and now gold .
what are you trying to do ?
emma .
there is nothing you can &apos;t come back from
if you just tell us .
what i &apos;m doing is my business , but it &apos;s for the best .
trust me .
i was starting to .
and , like henry , i was seeing the good in you .
but i was wrong .
i thought you could be different .
i thought you could escape the darkness .
but then you had to go and rip a 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl &apos;s heart out .
what ?
now you &apos;re breaking and entering ?
oh , no . you don &apos;t get to be self @-@ righteous with me .
not after what you &apos;ve done .
henry saw what you did .
he &apos;s devastated .
i was trying to make it up to him .
make it up to him ?
by reuniting a girl and her horse ?
oh , let me guess .
you let the damn thing out in the first place .
you forget -- i have some experience with dark ones .
everything &apos;s a manipulation .
it all would &apos;ve been fine
if you could &apos;ve just helped yourself and stayed out of it .
maybe you &apos;re the one causing pain .
listen to you trying to justify everything .
if i &apos;m the one on the moral high ground ,
you &apos;ve fallen quite a ways , ms. swan .
don &apos;t &quot; ms. swan &quot; me . we &apos;ve been through too much .
you know i never would have done that to henry
if i didn &apos;t have good reason .
&quot; good reason . &quot;
you know , that &apos;s exactly what my mother said
to justify what she did to daniel .
what i did in camelot , i did to protect henry .
she thought she was protecting me , too .
i didn &apos;t have a choice .
there &apos;s always a choice , emma .
you &apos;ve said that to me a thousand times .
we were running out of time .
it was the only way to free merlin .
merlin ?
wait -- we freed merlin in camelot ?
but if that &apos;s true , why are you still the dark one ?
this is a waste of time . i want to see my son .
well , i don &apos;t think he wants to see you .
goodbye , ms. swan .
