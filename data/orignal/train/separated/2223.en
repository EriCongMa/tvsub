There is a town in Maine
where every storybook character you've ever known
is trapped between two worlds...
You're the only thing in this whole place that feels right.
Victims of a powerful curse...
The evil queen sent everyone from the enchanted forest here.
They don't remember who they are.
I just wanna make sure Henry's okay.
He's fine.
She's a con woman. All I'm doing is trying to protect you.
You belong together.
How in the hell did you get like this?
Only one knows the truth...
How far are you willing to go?
As far as it takes.
And she'll stop at nothing...
Graham!
Till someone breaks the spell.
Graham! Graham!
Don't underestimate me.
You have no idea what I'm capable of.
Papa! Papa!
They've come for Morraine.
No! No!
No! No! Please. Please.
No! Don't take her!
Please.
No! You can't take her!
She's my baby! Don't take my baby!
Nonsense. She's a fine, strong girl.
She'll make a fine soldier.
It's a mistake. She's turning 14. Only 14!
Orders of the duke.
The ogre wars have taken their toll this season.
More troops will turn the tide.
They lowered the age again, papa.
I know.
Take her.
No!
She'll ride with me.
No! You can't have her!
The dark one seems to think I can.
My birthday is in three days.
They'll come for me in three days.
We'll find a way. We'll... we'll find a way.
Gold?
You in here?
Well, it is my shop.
What is that?
Oh, this is lanolin. Used for waterproofing.
It smells like livestock.
Well, it is the reason why sheeps' wool repels water.
It stinks.
Um, if there was a reason you called the sheriff's department,
if you want to talk about that quickly or outside...
Yes.
I just wanted to, uh, express my condolences, really.
The sheriff was a good man.
You're still wearing the deputy's badge.
Well, he's been gone two weeks now.
And I believe that after two weeks of acting as sheriff,
the job becomes yours.
You'll have to wear the real badge.
Yeah, I guess.
I'm just not in a hurry.
So, um, thank you for the kind words.
I have his things.
What?
The sheriff.
He rented an apartment that I own.
Another reason for my call, really.
I wanted to offer you a keepsake.
I don't need anything.
As you wish.
I'll give them to Mayor Mills.
It seems like she was the closest thing he had to family.
I'm not sure about that.
No love lost there, I see.
I fear that all of this stuff
is headed directly for the trash bin.
You really should take something.
Look. His jacket.
No.
Well, look.
Your boy might like these, don't you think?
You could play together.
I don't...
No, please.
They... they grow up so fast.
Thanks.
You enjoy these with your boy.
Your time together is precious, you know?
That's the thing about children--
before you know it...
you lose them.
Brought you something.
Thought we could use them together for Operation Cobra.
Thanks.
Oh, come on.
What's up? You've been ducking me for weeks.
I think we should stop Cobra stuff for a while.
You don't play with a curse.
Look what happened to Graham.
Henry, I told you. They did an autopsy.
It's totally natural causes.
Okay, whatever. You don't believe. Good.
I could keep you from messing with it
and getting killed.
You're worried about me?
She killed Graham because he was good.
And you're good.
Henry...
Good loses. Good always loses,
because good has to play fair.
Evil doesn't.
She's evil.
This is probably best.
I don't want to upset her any more.
I'm sorry.
That's not for you.
It's been two weeks.
Promotion is automatic.
Unless the mayor appoints someone else
within the time period, which I'm doing today.
So who's it gonna be?
After due reflection, Sidney Glass.
Sidney from the newspaper?
How does that even make sense?
Well, he's covered the sheriff's office
for as long as anyone can remember.
And he'll do whatever you want him to.
You just cannot stand the fact
that things have been getting better around here, can you?
Better?
Are you referring to Graham's death as better?
No.
He was a good man, Ms. Swan.
He made this town safe, and forgive me for saying it,
but you have not earned the right to wear his badge.
Graham picked me... to be deputy.
He was wrong.
No, he knew what he was doing.
He freed this office from your leash.
You're not getting it back.
Actually, I just did.
Ms. Swan, you're fired.
Toaster broken?
It wasn't when I started with it.
Pretty sure it is now.
I just needed to hit something.
What's going on?
Regina fired me
so she could put one of her own puppets in as sheriff.
That's my job.
Never heard you so passionate about it before.
What happened?
I don't know. I just...
I know I want it back.
There must be a reason.
Maybe...
I just want to beat her.
Good evening, Ms. Swan. Sorry for the intrusion.
There's something I'd like to discuss with you.
I'll let you two talk.
Come on in.
Thank you.
I,
I heard about what happened. Such an injustice.
Yeah, well, what's done is done.
Spoken like a true fighter.
I don't know what chance I have.
She's Mayor, and I'm...
Well... Me.
Ms. Swan, two people with a common goal
can accomplish many things.
Two people with a common enemy...
can accomplish even more.
How would you like a benefactor?
A benefactor?
Do you mind?
You know...
It really is, quite shocking
how few people study the Town Charter.
The Town Charter?
Well, it's quite comprehensive.
And the Mayor's authority?
Well, maybe she's not quite as powerful as she seems.
Bae.
Bae.
Waken up, son. Come on, waken up, son.
We're going now. We're going now. Come on. Come on.
It feels wrong to run away.
It's worse to die, son.
I'm not having you taken away to that ogres-war.
Alms? Alms for the poor? Alms for the poor?
Yes.
Oh, thank you. Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
Are we sure there's no other way?
Oh, I can't lose you, Bae.
You're all I got left, son.
You don't understand what war is like,
what they do to you.
Quick. Hide. In the ditch. Hide. Go. Go.
Go!
Stop right there!
What are you doing on the King's Road?
We have some wool to sell at the fair in Longbourne, sir.
I know you, don't I?
What was your name?
Spindleshanks?
Threadwhistle?
Hobblefoot?
His name's Rumplestiltskin.
Hush, boy.
Rumple...
The man who ran.
Is this your boy?
How old is he?
What's your name?
I'm Baelfire and I'm 13.
When's your birthday?
In two days' time.
Hush, boy.
Did you teach him how to run as well, Rumplestiltskin?
Did he tell you?
Did he tell you how he ran,
and the ogres turned the tide of the battle,
and all the others were killed?
And he returned home
to a wife who could not bear the sight of him.
Please.
You see, women do not like to be married to cowards.
Please don't speak to my boy like that.
It's treason to avoid service.
Take the boy now.
No. No. No. No. What do you want?
What do I want?
You have no money,
no influence, no land, no title, no power.
The truth is, all you really have is fealty.
Kiss my boot.
I don't understand.
You asked my price.
Kiss my boot.
Not in front of my boy.
Kiss my boot!
Papa!
No. No. No.
It's okay. Let me help you. Let me help you home.
Thank you, old man.
I don't have any money to pay you.
I can think of another way.
You just feed me whatever you can spare,
and I'll find a way to be your benefactor.
Come. Come.
Come.
Everyone deserves to feel safe in their own homes.
That's why Sidney Glass is my choice for post of sheriff.
This man has put the needs of Storybrooke above his own
for as long as any of us can remember,
as chief editor of the Storybrooke "Daily Mirror."
Please welcome
your new sheriff.
Hang on a second.
Oh, Ms. Swan, this is not appropriate.
The only thing not appropriate is this ceremony.
She does not have the power to appoint him.
The Town Charter clearly states "The Mayor shall appoint"--
A candidate. You can appoint a candidate.
It calls for an election.
The term "candidate" is applied loosely.
No, it's not. It requires a vote.
And guess what, Madam Mayor-- I'm running.
Fine. So is Sidney.
I am?
I am.
With my full support.
I'll guess we'll learn a little something
about the will of the people.
I guess we will.
Another day gone.
There'll be no fleeing now.
No.
You need to find another way.
You need to choose a different path.
Choose?
What choice do I have?
Everyone has a choice.
I'm the town...coward.
The only choice I have...
is which corner to hide in.
I'm lame...
friendless...
The only thing I've got is my boy...
And they're gonna take him away from me.
If they take him away, I will truly...
truly become dust.
Not if you have power.
You may as well say diamonds.
Get a hold of yourself.
Think.
Why do you think that someone as powerful as the dark one
would work for a useless fool like the Duke of the Frontlands?
Tell me.
The Duke has the dark one in thrall.
He's enslaved him with the power of a mystical dagger.
And on the blade is written a name--
The true name of the dark one.
If you were to steal the dagger...
then you would control the dark one yourself,
and then no one
would be able to take your son away from you.
But...
to keep a man like the dark one as a slave?
No. I-I can't.
I'd be terrified.
Then perhaps
instead of controlling the power...
you need to take it.
Regina.
Shall I move some things,
make a bit of space for your rage?
You found that loophole in the Town Charter.
Legal documents-- contracts if you like--
always been a fascination of mine.
Yes, you love to trifle with technicalities.
I like small weapons, you see--
the needle,
the pen,
the fine point of a deal.
Subtlety-- not your style, I know.
You're a bastard.
I think your grief's getting the better of you, Regina.
Shame what happened to Graham.
Don't you talk about him.
You know nothing.
What is there to know? He died.
Are you really going up against me?
Not directly.
We are, after all,
both invested in the common good.
We're just picking different sides.
Well, I think you picked a really slow horse this time.
It's not like you to back a loser.
She hasn't lost yet.
She will.
Never underestimate someone who's acting for their child.
He's not her child.
Not legally.
Now who's trifling with technicalities?
How was school?
Okay.
You're reading that paper pretty hard.
Sidney wrote it.
Is it a lie?
曾经的囚徒 艾玛·斯旺监狱产子
No.
I was born in jail?
Yes.
These records were supposed to be sealed.
Tell me you're not scarred for life.
I'm not.
Well, not by this.
Good. Then let's throw this out,
and we will get our news from something more reliable,
like the internet.
That's what I've been trying to tell you.
Good can't beat evil
because good doesn't do this kind of thing.
My mom plays dirty.
That's why you can't beat her, ever.
I have a new ally. Mr. Gold said he's gonna help.
Mr. Gold?
He's even worse than she is.
You already owe him one favor.
You don't want to owe him any more.
Don't do this.
This was a juvie record.
This was sealed by court order.
I don't know how you got it,
but that's abuse of power and illegal.
Oh, I'm sorry. You didn't want people to know
you cut his cord with a shiv?
I don't care what people know,
but this hurts Henry.
He would've learned eventually.
We all lose our heroes at some point.
He doesn't need to lose anything more.
He's depressed, Madam Mayor.
He doesn't have any... any hope. Don't you see that?
He's fine.
He's not fine.
I mean, think about it-- watching his adoptive mother
throw an illegal smear campaign against his birth mother?
You don't think that would be upsetting?
All I did was expose him to the truth.
And as for the legality,
I did nothing wrong.
But you and Sidney will have a chance
to get into all that at the debate.
Debate?
Yes, Ms. Swan, there's a debate.
You two can talk about jail time and juvie records
and maybe even your new association with Mr. Gold.
He's a snake, Ms. Swan.
You need to be careful who you get into bed with.
I'm not getting into bed with anyone.
I'm just fighting fire with--
All right. Come on. Let's go. We gotta get out of here.
I can't move! You have to get me out.
Help me.
Keep that fire good and stoked, Bae.
The sheep's fat needs to be liquid.
And get that wool good and soaked.
Why are we doing this, papa?
This is good wool. We can spin and sell.
These are our keys to the castle, son.
Once I'm inside, there's something I have to take.
What do you need to take?
That old beggar-- he told me a fine tale
about the Duke and his magical dagger.
What does it do?
If I own that dagger,
I control the dark one.
If I kill the dark one with the dagger,
I take his powers.
By God's name.
Imagine me with those powers.
Can you imagine me with those powers, Bae?
I could get to redeem myself.
I could turn it towards good.
I'll save all the children of the Frontlands,
not just you, my boy.
I'd love to see that,
but if the law says I'm to fight, I-I can fight.
No. No. The--the law doesn't want you to fight, son.
The law wants you to die.
That's not battle.
That's...
That's a sacrifice, son.
You look at that red in the sky.
That's not the--the fires of the battlefields.
That's the blood of our people, son.
It's the blood of children,
the blood of children like you.
I mean, what sane person would want to get involved with that?
So it's true?
What?
It's true--it's true you ran.
I had no choice, son.
And mother--
did she leave you like the knight said?
You told me she was dead.
She is dead.
So... What do we need to do?
The duke's castle is made of stone,
but the floors and the rafters...
made of wood.
Why does that matter?
Because wood burns.
You're gonna leave me, aren't you?
Oh! Oh! Ow! My ankle!
Set me down gently!
Seriously? You're complaining about how I saved your life?
The firemen are here.
It's not like we were really in danger.
Fine.
Next time, I'll just--
No, you know what? Next time, I'll do the same thing
and the time after that,
because that is what decent human beings do.
That's what good people do.
Hey, did Emma really rescue my mom?
Enough.
Regina.
I'm fine.
A nice shot of the victim?
Sidney, what the hell are you doing?
Are you trying to hand this election to her?
But it's news.
She's the competition, you fool.
Did you really rescue Regina?
She did. The firemen said it.
They saw it.
You are a hero.
We should see if they have a picture of the rescue.
We can make campaign posters.
Oh, people would love that. That's a great idea.
Wait.
So I'll get the photo and then you--
Can you write it up?
This is how good wins.
You do something good, and people see it
and then they wanna help you.
Maybe you're right.
You see, Henry?
We don't have to fight dirty.
Loads of visitors today.
I do hope you're not gonna break my little bell.
You set the fire.
I've been right here, Ms. Swan.
Take a whiff. It smells like your sheep crap oil.
Turns out it's flammable.
Well, are you sure?
There's some construction working
on at city hall at the moment.
There's loads of flammable solvents used in construction.
Why did you do it?
If I did it,
if I did it, that would be because
you cannot win without something big,
something like, uh,
oh, I don't know, being the hero in a fire?
How could you even know I'd be there at the right time?
Maybe Regina's not the only one with eyes and ears in this town
or maybe... I'm just intuitive.
Were I involved.
I could've run and left her there.
Not the type.
I can't go along with this.
You just did.
This is just the price of election, Ms. Swan.
A price I'm not willing to pay.
Find another sucker.
Okay, go ahead. Expose me.
But if you do,
just think about what you'll be exposing
and what you'll be walking away from.
Oh, yes, and, uh,
who you might be disappointing.
今日公布
David, hi.
Mary Margaret.
I was just, uh...
Yeah, me, too.
How are things?
Okay.
Oh, I got a job.
Yeah. I'm working at the animal shelter.
Really?
Yeah.
So... Sidney?
Yeah, well, my wife is friends with Regina, so...
Oh, right. How is kathryn?
Good. She's meeting me here later.
That's wonderful.
Well, I'm all out of posters. I'm gonna go get some more.
Citizens of Storybrooke,
uh, we welcome you to--
Uh, welcome, citizens of Storybrooke.
Oh. Uh, we welcome you--
citizens of Storybrooke, welcome, uh...
I'm not gonna win.
What are you talking about?
Everyone's talking about what you did in the fire.
No, Henry's right.
I can't beat Regina at this, not the way she fights.
Watch and see.
Is this really just about beating Regina?
It's just...
Henry.
I want to show him that good can actually win.
That's why you want to win it for him,
but why do you want to win the election for yourself?
That is why.
I want to show him that a hero can win.
And if I'm not...
If I'm not a hero and I'm not the savior,
then what part do I have in his life?
Okay. There it is.
There it is.
Papa! I was so worried for you.
Bae
Are you burned? The castle--
I'm fine, son. I'm fine.
I need you to go home and wait for me there.
Come with me, please. I have a bad feeling.
Bae, this is something I have to do on my own.
Go home, son.
Go home and wait for me, Bae.
I'll be back. You go.
Zoso.
Zoso.
I summon thee.
You were asking for me?
Submit, oh dark one!
I control you.
Yes, you do.
Wield the power wisely.
You can wield at any time now.
It's almost dawn.
That means it's your son's birthday.
I bet Hordor and his men are already on their way to your house.
No, they can't take him.
You don't control them.
You control me.
Have you ever wondered
was he really your child at all?
Unlike you, he's not a coward
and yearns to fight and die in glory.
No.
What a poor bargain that would be--
to lay down your soul to save your bastard son.
So I ask you...
what would you...
have me...
do?
Die!
It's you.
You're the beggar.
Looks like you made a deal you didn't understand.
I don't think you're gonna do that again.
You told me to kill you?
My life was such a burden.
You'll see.
Magic always comes with a price,
and now it's yours to pay.
Why me? Why me?
I know how to recognize...
a desperate soul.
No.
No! Stay!
You have to tell me what to do!
Tell me what to do!
Rumplestiltskin
Tragedy has brought us here,
but we are faced with this decision,
and now we ask only that you listen with an open mind
and to please vote your conscience.
So without further ado, I'd like to introduce you
to the candidates-- Sidney Glass
and Emma Swan.
Glass. Swan.
Sounds like something that a decorator would make you buy.
Wow. Crickets. Okay, uh...
Uh, Mr. Glass, your opening statement.
I just want to say that if elected,
I want to serve as a reflection of the best qualities of Storybrooke--
honesty,
neighborliness...
and strength.
Thank you.
And Emma Swan.
You guys all know I have...
what they call a, uh,
troubled past,
but you've been able to overlook it
because of the, um...
hero thing.
But here's the thing,
the fire was a setup.
Mr. Gold agreed to support me in this race,
but I didn't know that that meant he was going to set a fire.
I don't have definitive evidence,
but I'm sure.
And the worst part of all this was...
The worst part of all this is,
I let you all think it was real.
And I can't win that way.
I'm sorry.
Another?
Oh, hell, yes.
Hey, Henry.
What's this for?
You stood up to Mr. Gold.
It's pretty amazing.
He did something illegal.
That's what heroes do,
expose stuff like that.
I shouldn't have given up on Operation Cobra.
I thought I might find you here.
With a drink.
And my son.
Here to card me, officer?
Well, not at all. In fact, I think I'll join you.
Here? I don't know.
I think they're setting up a back room for the victory party.
Well, you'll have to tell me what that's like.
Congratulations.
Sheriff Swan.
Wait. What?
It was a very close vote.
But people really seem to like the idea of a sheriff
brave enough to stand up to Mr. Gold.
Are you joking?
She doesn't joke.
You didn't pick a great friend in Mr. Gold, Ms. Swan.
But he does make a superlative enemy.
Enjoy that.
Everyone's watching from behind their curtains today.
Dark one.
No.
Who are you?
Have you forgotten me already?
What was it you used to call me again?
Spindleshanks?
Hobblefoot.
Papa?
Rumplestiltskin.
Wonderful.
And now you shall know me,
as the new dark one.
How about a little fealty?
Kiss my boot.
No! Papa!
Papa?
What has happened to you?
You're safe, Bae.
Do you feel safe, son?
No.
I'm frightened.
I'm not.
I protected what belongs to me.
And I'm not scared of anything.
The sheriff's jacket,
I thought you might want it after all.
You do know I'm armed, right?
It's all part of the act, my dear.
Political theater in an actual theater.
I knew no one was gonna vote for you,
unless we gave you some kind of extraordinary quality.
And I'm afraid saving old Regina's arse from the fire
just wasn't gonna do that.
We had to give you a higher form of bravery.
They had to see you defy me,
and they did.
No way.
There is no way you planned that.
Everyone's afraid of Regina,
but they're more afraid of me.
By standing up to me, you won them over.
It was the only way.
You knew I'd agree.
Oh, yeah.
I know how to recognize a desperate soul.
Why did you do this?
We made a deal some time back, Ms. Swan.
We established that you owed me a favor.
I know that can be a bad feeling,
Owing someone.
Now that you're sheriff,
I'm sure we'll find some way for you to pay back what you owe me.
Congratulations.
