then she moved to england and picked up this fake british accent .
on the machine , this is her message :
&quot; monica , darling , it &apos;s amanda calling . &quot;
are you trying to do a british accent ?
chandler gets pedicures .
just so i know , how many more of those can i expect ?

&quot; oh , so sorry to catch you on your mobile . &quot;
if you didn &apos;t wanna get me on my mobile , then don &apos;t call me on my mobile .
and she always brags about all the famous people she &apos;s met .
oh , i know !
&quot; i slept with billy joel . &quot;
all right , who hasn &apos;t ?
what are we gonna do ? i don &apos;t wanna see her .
let &apos;s just cut her out .
what ?
cut her out of our lives .
just ignore her calls and dodge her till she gets the point .
well , i guess we could try that . but it seems so harsh .
have you ever done that ?
no . had it done to me , though .
feels good .
all right , mr. geller , right this way .
so how dark do you wanna be ? we have one , two or three .
well , i like how you look . what are you ?
puerto rican .

you &apos;ll face the red light .
when the light &apos;s on , the spraying &apos;s about to start , so close your eyes .
when the spraying stops , count to five ..
pat yourself to avoid drip marks , then turn to get your back . got it ?

all right , turn around . i gotta get a look at this thing .
sorry .
well , this is romantic .
i &apos;m sorry . this has never happened to me before .
i &apos;m an expert at taking off bras . i could do it with one hand .
i could do it with my eyes closed . once i just looked at one ..
and it popped open .
i blame your bra .
it &apos;s a standard @-@ issue bra clasp .
then i blame you . yeah . that &apos;s right . you threw me off with all your slapping .
okay , look , i &apos;m really sorry about that , joey .
but do you think maybe , on some level , you don &apos;t want to take off my bra ?
no , i don &apos;t have another level .
hi .
oh , dear god .
hold on . there &apos;s something different .
i went to that tanning place your wife suggested .
was that place the sun ?
oh , and it gets worse .
oh , my god , you can do a duet of &quot; ebony and lvory &quot; all by yourself .
how could you mess this up ? it &apos;s so easy .
you go in the booth , count to five and turn around .
how do you count to five ?
one , two , three ..
damn it !
i know !
what is up with miss hawaiian tropic ?
how was your date with joey ?
well , it was good , until we got back to our apartment .
and then we were fooling around and he started to put his hand up my leg ..
and i kept slapping it away .
you didn &apos;t like that ?
well , it wasn &apos;t just me , all right ? he freaked out too .
he couldn &apos;t even undo my bra .
really ? one time he just looked at my bra and it popped open .
i do not know what &apos;s wrong with us .
we &apos;ve kissed before and that &apos;s been great .
but this time it was leading somewhere ..
and i was very aware of the fact that it was joey touching me .
you guys have been friends forever .
the first time you kissed ross was weird .
you couldn &apos;t stop laughing . you got through that .
okay . that &apos;s true . that &apos;s true , we can do this .
you &apos;re right . we can do this . we &apos;ll just power through .
chandler , can i talk to you for a second ?
no need , problem solved . we are powering through .
chandler , stop . it &apos;s not going to pop open .
you don &apos;t know .
hi , phoebe .
hey .
is amanda here yet ?
no .
i &apos;m sorry for screwing up that &quot; cutting her out &quot; plan , but i have a new plan .
chandler will call in a few minutes with an emergency .
okay , what kind of emergency gets us both out of here ?
what do you think of mike and chandler being in a car accident ?
are you kidding ? i love it !
okay .
hi .
hi .
hello !
it &apos;s so nice to see you .
both of you , look at me . look how young i look !
oh , gosh , we have so much to catch up on .
but first things first . touch my abs . i don &apos;t exercise at all .
oh , gosh . so , monica , you &apos;re married .
yeah , his name is chandler and he &apos;s ..
oh , smell my neck .
it &apos;s not perfume . it &apos;s me . it &apos;s my natural scent .
musty .
gosh , this is brilliant . gosh , it &apos;s just like old times .
i &apos;m so happy you two are friends again .
when were we not friends ?
well , it was 1992 .
and i remember , because that was the year i had sex with evel knievel .
we were friends in 1992 .
no , i distinctly remember you were dodging her calls ..
and trying to avoid seeing her .
you were going to cut me out ?
well , kind of .
oh , my god !
oh , bugger .
should i not have said that ? i feel like a perfect arse .
well , in america , you &apos;re just an ass .
hello ?
chandler , what &apos;s wrong ?
oh , my god , are you all right ? yeah , i &apos;ll be right there .
i &apos;m so sorry , but chandler was in a car accident .
oh , my god .
yeah .
was mike with him ?
nope .
got the champagne ?
yes . ready to power through .
excellent . put it on ice , the phone is off the hook ..
and , in the interest of powering through ..
oh , sure . now . yeah .
okay , sexy ..
very sexy . sexy . all right , let &apos;s do it !
okay , you &apos;re scaring me a little bit .
get over it , soldier , we gotta do this .
okay . you like that , huh ?
oh , yeah .
you like that ? let &apos;s kick this into high gear , huh ?
yeah , baby ! i &apos;ll show you how we do it !
no , no , no !
you kneed me in my misters !
what ? oh , my god . i &apos;m so sorry .
joey ? are you okay ?
soldier down .
we are not friends with phoebe anymore .
if she asks , i protested a little , but okay .
i just found out that she tried cutting me out .
can you think of any reason why someone would want to do that ?
what is wrong with me , chandler ? tell me .
i had a very bad car accident .
chandler , thank god you &apos;re alive . monica , can i talk to you outside ?
i have nothing to say to you .
my flat is twice this size .
you know , they asked me to be one of the spice girls .
please , monica , in the hall ?
oh , that accident must have been terrible .
you look positively ghastly .
well , aren &apos;t you a treat .
i can &apos;t believe you tried to cut me out . why , phoebe ? why ?
it was right after we were living together ..
and you were driving me crazy , okay ?
you were really controlling and compulsive and shrill .
well , i &apos;m still all those things !
you &apos;re also so generous and kind and scrappy .
i am scrappy .
exactly . no matter what i tried to do , i couldn &apos;t keep you out of my life .
of all the people i &apos;ve cut out ..
you were the only one who ever clawed her way back in .
that &apos;s because i &apos;m scrappy .
yeah , you are , and i &apos;m so glad that you fought your way back in ..
because i don &apos;t know what i would do without you .
i don &apos;t know what i would do without you .
well , i guess we should go back in . i mean , you gave me another chance .
we should do the same for amanda .
yeah , i guess you &apos;re right .
can you believe it ? i &apos;ve never had any professional dance training .
now , let me explain how this works . you go into the booth and ..
i &apos;m gonna stop you right there , glenda . okay ?
does it look like this is my first time ?
now , i want four two &apos;s , and i want them all on my back .
okay .
wait . there &apos;s two sets of nozzles ! which one is it ? which one is it ?
oh , son of a bitch !
are you kidding ?
how did we do ?
i &apos;m a twelve .
what is the matter with us ?
well , i know what &apos;s the matter with me .
no , i mean with us , you know ? i mean , is it supposed to be this ..
difficult ?
i don &apos;t know .
that fake british woman &apos;s a real bitch , but she sure can dance .
hey .
hi .
hey , listen , can i ask you a question ? when you and monica first hooked up ..
was it weird going from friends to more than that ?
kind of . sneaking around , having to hide from you guys ..
no , no , no . no , i mean ..
sexually .
yeah , was there a part of you that felt like it was ..
really wrong ?
actually , no . no , it felt right , you know ?
if felt like , &quot; i can &apos;t believe we haven &apos;t been doing this the whole time . &quot;
i can tell from your expressions that &apos;s the good news you were hoping for .
well , i &apos;m gonna go continue to spread the joy .
just because it happened that way for them doesn &apos;t mean it has to for us .
yeah . yeah , absolutely .
i mean , just because something &apos;s difficult doesn &apos;t mean that you quit .
right , totally .
yeah . and so ..
we &apos;ll just keep trying and trying until we do it .
if not , we &apos;ll just be a couple that never has sex .
that &apos;s a plan .
i did not see this coming .
i know .
i don &apos;t know , i don &apos;t get it . i mean , i was so sure this is what i wanted .
me too .
well , how come monica and chandler could do it ?
i guess they weren &apos;t as good friends as we are .
i bet you &apos;re right .
so ..
yeah .
i love you .
love you too .
all right , i &apos;m going to bed .
yeah , me too .
yeah . i &apos;m not going anywhere for a while .
dude , it &apos;s chandler . let me in .
go away !
i don &apos;t wanna see anybody !
i went to the tanning place and the same thing happened to me . let me in .
really ?
did you count mississippi @-@ ly ?
