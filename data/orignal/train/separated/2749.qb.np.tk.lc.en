tony hey . i tented the bulbs .
oh good .
i &apos;ve been meaning to ask you ...
the sacrimonis ...
i &apos;ve been doin &apos; his yard over there a year and change now ...
and ?
i guess what i &apos;m asking is
how much longer do i have to keep doin &apos; this on the arm ?
oh so it was okay when we were gettin &apos; you
out of your feech la manna problem huh ?
but suddenly ... short fuckin &apos; memory ?
i appreciate that tony . don &apos;t get me wrong but ...
you &apos;re a selfish prick sal . you know that ?
her husband &apos;s in jail . don &apos;t you think this is the time
when mrs. sacrimoni needs you the most ?
the federal prosecutors and myself have been told
to clear our calendars for the next five months .
so trial is upon us .
and the feds have reached
a complete accounting of your worth .
&quot; the vintage wurlitzer &quot; ?
they go through my fuckin &apos; sock drawer ?
they shot a video the day of your arrest .
they even tracked down the 180 grand
in boca raton under your father &apos;s name .
they estimate your net worth at $ 5 million ...
while ginny lives on scraps .
... between your cash and portfolios
with fidelity and vanguard
your 401k and severance parachute from essany scaffolding
condo in deal beach at 450
maserati ginny &apos;s yukon
and the house and its contents valued at a million two .
is this all part of your plan ron
make me so fuckin &apos; depressed that i hang myself ?
it &apos;s my obligation to raise the idea again of cooperating .
flip ?
let me explain something to you again ron
but differently .
being a rat where i &apos;m comin &apos; from
that &apos;s like asking a person where you &apos;re comin &apos; from
to become a fuckin &apos; nazi .
i don &apos;t wanna hear that shit again .
good .
because frankly i don &apos;t represent turncoats .
cause it would kill your practice .
what happened to my stuffed pork loin ?
you ever hear of knocking ?
i ordered it special .
you had them send it up to carmela ?
you get what you pay for .
hi .
she &apos;s your little twin .
bacala &apos;s got no fuckin &apos; genes at all .
you never miss a chance to shit on him do you ?
i &apos;m joking come on . she looks like you that &apos;s all .
i don &apos;t know why you just can &apos;t admit
that you blame us that you got shot .
unfortunately i have only myself to blame .
&quot; unfortunately . &quot; oh .
so obviously you &apos;d like to blame somebody .
i have only myself to blame .
you don &apos;t blame me for the shooting ?
well you fuckin &apos; blame me for something !
jan the baby .
you know marrying the boss &apos;s sister
usually it &apos;s a step up .
but you keep your goddamn foot on our necks .
you punish bobby because he &apos;s my husband .
will you stop huh ?
to be his age and not to be a captain ?
oh now i see what this little visit &apos;s all about .
he works so hard for you
and what does he get ?
merciless ridicule
about his weight about his model railroading .
he &apos;s a grown man !
oh but it &apos;s okay for neil young .
he owns lionel !
domenica ! take care of your things .
i don &apos;t know where it comes from
all your anger your hate for me .

i know i annoy people .
i think about you
iying in that hospital bed ...
i cried for you .
i sat with you .

the girls come around enough and that helps .
allegra &apos;s a little bitchy but it &apos;s painful for her to be here .
plus she thinks i resent her happiness .
newlyweds .
she &apos;s probably freaked out
that she &apos;s not happier herself .
ginny that kitchen ...
and this room the light ...
not his decision to make .
i &apos;m running that shop not him .
my days are completely full .
i shouldn &apos;t .

it reminds me of the palladian villas i saw in ltaly .
thank you . sometimes i forget .
and it &apos;s embarrassing . i spend most of my time upstairs .
wellbutrin .
i wish there was a pill
john in that place ?
of course i can &apos;t say my pain &apos;s worse than anybody &apos;s .
yeah yeah . we &apos;re both grownups .
i &apos;d rather go with my own instincts .
your feet are like fuckin &apos; icicles .

tony i &apos;ve been very patient with you because you &apos;ve been sick .
you were going to talk to the building inspector .
my spec house .
oh yeah . yeah yeah .
i sent little paulie .
they made some headway with the supervisor
but the other guy the inspector he &apos;s a piece of work .
next i &apos;ll get sil on it .
gotta pay a visit to the montville building department .
to what end ?
i &apos;ve been promising carm i &apos;d lean on this inspector .
completely went out of my head .
the guy &apos;s name is uh ron senkowski .
ginny sack &apos;s brother anthony .
ah the lord of the lenses .
actually we just started carrying these .
the newest cross pen .
ah ... a rollerball .
you want a classic fountain ?
nah . have a seat .
so how &apos;s your brother @-@ in @-@ law ?
john &apos;s fuckin &apos; made of steel .
i was told &quot; your ears only . &quot;
oh that &apos;s why he didn &apos;t get a pen ?
no l ... he &apos;s fuckin &apos; with you anthony .
johnny &apos;s a silent partner
in this heavy equipment leasing thing in new orleans .
good . fema &apos;s down there handing out krugerrands in buckets .
he said post @-@ katrina
you had some knowledge of business in the area .
well let me say this
dick cheney for president ... of the fuckin &apos; universe .
on account of john &apos;s uh liquidity problems ...
the asset freeze ...
he &apos;d love you to contact these brothers
the owners--and turn it into cash .
me ? says phil leotardo shouldn &apos;t be involved .
just know john &apos;s asking as a friend .
and obviously there &apos;s a finder &apos;s fee .
what the hell &apos;s this a siesta ?
what ? i wasn &apos;t sleeping .
i was resting my hips .
i &apos;m supposed to have surgery .
am i early ?
what do you mean ?
dinner .
i am interviewing a new contractor for my spec
bill degillio .
he built the sacrimoni house .
he did decent workmanship . ginny says he works for a price .
so ?
well your sister loves that house .
she said it reminded her of a &quot; villa in ltaly . &quot;
what is he coming here now ?
i picked up a couple of sandwiches from ltalianissimo .
you know your father did this house
and it was more than decent workmanship .
you think about replacing him before you rush off
into something that could maybe cost you a lot more of your time .
why do you suddenly care so much about my dad ?
and i like that she has these little projects
and charities what @-@ have @-@ you .
makes her happy
keeps her busy .
but ...
even in bed she &apos;s a million miles away .
sounds like you want to encourage her with this house
as long as it doesn &apos;t interfere with your life .
carmela and me we
we came to an understanding
when we reconciled
i would financially back her spec house
and she would have more of a don &apos;t @-@ ask @-@ don &apos;t @-@ tell policy
towards my work
and my recreational life outside of the home .
but you tell me there hasn &apos;t been
much recreating since the shooting .
no and that &apos;s okay .
fucking janice came to visit me at work .
that doesn &apos;t happen often .
well she shops for meat there .
we get it free .
and by the way again if you ever need a roast
or any specialty kind of cut
please just ask .
my dad used to drop us off there
when he had to run errands .
we &apos;d go into the back and we &apos;d steal cigarettes
play house you know shit like that .
anyway she was all upset .
she said that i was mean to her
and her husband .
what did you say ?
well it doesn &apos;t matter
cause she &apos;s right .
i love it when i can take a shit on her
and her husband .
what &apos;s that about ?
even when they told me that uncle jun &apos; might need diapers
i thought about bobby having to change him
i still get a kick out of it .
it makes bob seem weak ?
your sister too ?
these are acts of kindness .
janice only does &quot; acts of janice . &quot;
trust me .
you two have never really gotten along ?
well not never . she was my older sister .
i thought she was pretty cool .
and she gave it back to my mother .
let me tell you that was some heroic shit .
because she defended you .
please . it was every man for himself .
i remember one time my parents left her in charge .
go ahead .
well she stood in the hallway and she tape @-@ recorded
me and barb having a fight .
and she held that cassette tape over my head for a month .
fuckin &apos; extortion .
made me make her bed get her shit .
did she do that to barbara too ?
well that &apos;s not the fuckin &apos; point .
i &apos;ve been coming here--i don &apos;t know--five years now
and you still don &apos;t understand what it means to tape somebody in my family ?
you still don &apos;t fucking get this ?
listen as far as that thing goes
the coffee with the chicory
what the fuck is that ?
oh shit .
i suck at talking like this john . i &apos;m sorry .
our friend with the stomach .
in town or near home ?
your neighbor .
a.s.
yeah all right .
just say &quot; the thing i asked you to do . &quot;
&quot; the coffee with the fuckin &apos; chicory . &quot;
is he gonna get it for me ?
yes .
bad news is he wants 10 cups for himself .
not seven .
all right . done .
did you pick up the birthday cake for gin with the marzipan flowers ?
the stuff behind the pool ?
no an actual fuckin &apos; cake .
it &apos;s her birthday .
what are you doing ?
i &apos;m comin &apos; with you .
okay but stand clear .
what &apos;s going on ?
pastor heard water running
went down basement &apos;s flooded
and they &apos;re trying to shut down the pipe .
but the pastor &apos;s trapped standing on a milk crate .
anybody go get him ?
there &apos;s an arcing wire hanging .
these assholes skipped a conduit when they remodeled .
i spent years as a contractor .
electrical is where i got started .

what the fuck did i tell you ?
fuck you . the guy was gonna get cooked .
what are you trying to be a big man ?
back the fuck off !
what the fuck jim ?
boys boys calm down .
okay now let &apos;s cut the bullshit get the water turned off
and pump out the damn basement .
i gotta say i thought you guys were morons for doing this shit
but now i can see it &apos;s a fuckin &apos; rush .
you should join the department . that would be good .
we could use another moron .
of course it &apos;s a commitment firefighting .
every day it &apos;s there .
you have to have a passion really .
i &apos;ve got these bad hips . supposed to have surgery .
well this is all bullshit talk anyway .
you &apos;re probably gonna forget this craphole
the minute you hear from your publisher .
hey darts ! five bucks a point . who &apos;s in ?

well according to john the retail value of bayou leasing
is around six mil . seem about right ?
between five and six .
let &apos;s do this again chere .
well you &apos;re gonna have to find a buyer and deliver john &apos;s half to me
and in about 30 days give you a chance to get a couple of bidders .
his half ?
yeah .
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s up for debate .
had you controlled your fuckin &apos; football jones
we wouldn &apos;t even have no fuckin &apos; silent partner .
that man floated me 50 grand . 50 .
next thing i know he &apos;s buying in for half a fucking million .
look at him sitting there like they don &apos;t do this shit every day .
you took john &apos;s loan . he helped you expand .
now it &apos;s time to cash in .
listen mr soprano that &apos;s what i &apos;ve been saying all along .
you know you two don &apos;t seem like brothers .
in @-@ laws . he married my little sis .
15 years of womanly company
but i had to come all the way to new jersey to get truly fucked .
you know i &apos;m doing this as a favor to john .
and i don &apos;t need another headache .
so do we got a problem here ?
no sir . i &apos;m buying a boat .
now you fancy yourself a businessman .
would you sell now with all that money pouring into new orleans ?
john sacrimoni asked me to .
well we &apos;re very different people .
ahem yeah .
heard about bobby bacala ?
yeah my sister called with the breaking news .
that fuckin &apos; part of newark
even the cops don &apos;t go there no more .
so you heard everything .
doctors said the slug blew bits of sidewalk into the eye there .
yeah i heard .
but they &apos;re optimistic .
right doctors .
it &apos;s always good news till it ain &apos;t .
speaking of that whatever the fuck happened to you
with the prostate ?
well actually t i &apos;ve been dealing with some shit .
cancer to tell you the truth .
what the fuck paulie ?
it was early . maybe i caught a break .
still encapsulated .
i &apos;m taking a course of radiation
to knock the psa back into the single digits .
well are you all right ? the hair and shit ?
heh knock wood eh ?
i must have done good things in my life .
yeah .
all right .
the cancer ...
your ears only .
absolutely .
you hear about bobby ?
yeah .
should &apos;ve seen him .
put a patch over his eye like hathaway .
he was really rattled .
still let &apos;s face it
it was kind of stupid to be out there that late .
ton &apos; cops don &apos;t even go there no more .
anyway bobby &apos;s vision &apos;s fucked now .
they &apos;re hoping the repair will take .
he could be a candidate for a cornea transplant .
he should be a candidate for a brain transplant .
to his credit
all he was thinking about was straightening out for the week .
fuck that &quot; honor and loyalty &quot; shit .
it was a maneuver carlo cause he knew it was his own fucking fault .
what ?
don &apos;t give me that look .
including the wife &apos;s lra
and his pension
we &apos;d go for 240 months .
20 years and 90 % of his assets ?
makes trial seem like a risk worth taking .
have you seen the discovery evidence ?
you came to us .
my client insisted the house is off @-@ limits .
he wants his wife provided for .
so what do you have in mind ?
renee again the shit that has nothing to do with him :
the house her lra the yukon
the deed on the daughter &apos;s condo .
and 12 years .
for a conspiracy to commit murder ?
get back to me when you &apos;re sober ron .
it &apos;s broken . wanna switch ?
oh no no . i &apos;m good .
carm just called . she &apos;s still getting her folks in the car .
where &apos;s barb and tom ?
i asked them to bring wine .
we &apos;ll see how long that takes .
did you take the vicodin ?
giants huh ?
fucking blowing &apos; em out .
as long as they don &apos;t beat the spread .
where are you going ?
out .
the giants are kicking ass here .
i &apos;m going to eric &apos;s to watch the chargers .
what channel &apos;s that on ?
some people aren &apos;t too cheap to buy the satellite package .
sit down . this is a giants house .
i hate the fucking giants .
ho ! what &apos;d we say about that language ?
aj didn &apos;t have to come to sunday dinner .
aj has a job . do you wanna go get a job ?
go ahead .
but first go get your last report card
and read it out loud to everybody .
no ? i thought so .
now go finish your spanish report before dinner .
set the table honey .
my brother @-@ in @-@ law almost got his fucking eye put out .
some fucking crackhead animals .
that is terrible .
yeah it is but ...
jesus christ it &apos;s one thing after another with her family .
you mean the bad luck ?
or do you feel like somehow they deserve it ?
i don &apos;t know but ...
fucking janice attracts drama .
she creams over the misery .
does she remind you of anyone ?
when we were growing up she had something
you know ? she ...
she had beautiful hair and she was built and ...
guys her age were always buying me ice cream
giving me baseball cards kissing my ass
to get in good with her .
sounds a little like jealousy .
no guy wants his sister to be the town pump .
you weren &apos;t sexually threatened ?
oh jesus christ will you make up your fucking sick mind ?
first it &apos;s my mother . now i wanna fuck my sister ?
it &apos;s normal not sick
that she functioned as
the focus of your early sexual feelings .
in fact it was probably mutual .
oh jesus christ .
you describe her as &quot; built . &quot;
all those afternoons in your father &apos;s office &quot; playing house . &quot;
whatever your bond
what happened between then and now ?
she fought it out with my mother and finally took off
first minute she could .
what if you had taken off ?
well that never would have happened
&apos;cause i wasn &apos;t like that . i did what i was told .
your father &apos;s son .
yeah that &apos;s right .
and all that went with it .
that &apos;s right . all the success and the money .
but beyond that what else did you inherit ?
i &apos;ll tell you what i inherited ...
my mother .
janice got laid . she took off .
she laughed at all this shit .
then the trip &apos;s over and she &apos;s back and she &apos;s one of us .
and she wants her piece .
well let me tell you she gets nothing !
&apos;cause i got the scars ! so it &apos;s mine !
what are you doing ?
cooking . how was the call ?
it was nothing . it was a laundromat on webster .
thought i &apos;d make a little dinner like we do back home .
we got pasta badan
macaroni and potatoes
real peasant food .
we got a little salad .
then pork chops
and vinegar peppers .
i fuckin &apos; miss this shit i gotta say .
i can see why .
you gotta wait for that .
what ?
nothing .
i just realized
the other night when you cut the power to the church ...
i was a real dick
yeah . but it was only because i was worried you know .
something could &apos;ve happened to you .
that &apos;s a nice thing .
you don &apos;t understand .
vincent ...
i love you .
i love you &quot; johnnycakes . &quot;
10 : 30 gotta be .
hour and a half lunch .
the halfway fuckin &apos; point .
don &apos;t look at your watch . not yet .
save it . treat yourself .

think of those sandwiches jim made .
when you &apos;ve eaten the last bite
this fuckin &apos; day is halfway gone .
11 : 30 has to be .

maybe even a quarter to 12 : 00 .
okay look .
now .
fuck me !
vincent ?
jiggle the toilet after .
vincent !
vincent !
moment of truth ?
it &apos;s still up to the judge
but they &apos;re gonna recommend 15 years
and $ 4.1 million .
you keep the home
the 45k in equity from the girls &apos; variable life insurance
and ginny &apos;s lra which is worth about 110 grand .
and ?
that &apos;s it .
or go to trial .
15 fucking years .
you &apos;re a young man .
in 15 years you &apos;ll be 67 .
the golden years .
grandkids .
do i have to to do the allocution ?
you know the allocution is always part of it
practically the whole point .
i &apos;ll take it .
that lra of ginny &apos;s
she worked the tie counter at wanamaker &apos;s .
that &apos;s where we met .
no mocha mix ?
i was looking forward to fresh blueberries this morning
but mom hasn &apos;t shopped .
what are you doing hanging around here ?
finn asked me into the city to see a movie
but i didn &apos;t want to go and i told him he could go
if he wanted to and he went .
really ?
yeah really .
don &apos;t give it to me okay ?
i know . i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s just ...
he doesn &apos;t fucking get it .
i don &apos;t even know what he &apos;s thinking lately .
he spends more time at jeffrey &apos;s apartment than with me .
come on .
you know who &apos;s really good to talk to about stuff ?
your mother .
this whole year off together i &apos;ve seen such a selfish side .
&quot; i &apos;ll come back early . &quot; he said that . he actually said that .
all right well ...
maybe he thought you wanted him to go .
i mean you did say it .
yeah or maybe subconsciously he &apos;s done .
we sleep together at jeffrey &apos;s apartment
and finn sleeps on the floor half the time
and i &apos;m right there for him .
okay well honey when you &apos;re living in sin with some guy
you can &apos;t expect---living in what ? !
jesus christ .
you should talk to your mother about this shit !

i was going to go on friday when the schedules are looser .

my god . how come your airbag didn &apos;t go off ?
somebody took it out . they sold it .
sold it ? who would do such a thing ?
look i &apos;m really sorry . i was in a rush .
so you admit it was your fault .
yeah absolutely .
let me get the damages here and i &apos;ll be on my way .
mmm we should file a police report .

well john was really counting on this .
and ginny needs the money
for allegra for the family .
what ?
he changed the terms .
what a bigger piece for his fat mouth ?
no smaller actually .
but it &apos;s the house .
he wants you to unload it to his sister
at a reduced price .
half actually .
but the new orleans thing ...
he &apos;ll knock 2 % off his finder &apos;s fee
and he &apos;ll make sure those pricks sell .
i guess beggars can &apos;t be choosers .
and the worst part is
i gotta sell the idea to ginny somehow .
gab took me to her moroccan tile place .
by the way i don &apos;t wanna pester you
did sil make a visit ?
yeah i meant to tell you .
he didn &apos;t have any luck with that inspector .
really ? you &apos;re kidding .
no . sorry about that .
did he bring him a gift ?
cash .
so how hard did he lean on the guy ?
carm sil knows his business .
look i know you &apos;re disappointed but ...
i just gotta put this out there
just sell it . you &apos;ll get a good price .
30 % return on your investment .
so that &apos;s it ? you you just give up ?

oh those sons of bitches .
all my planning for a fucking year !
and they let people build those fucking monstrosities !
you wanna go out to dinner tonight at least ?
why not put a runner here
or a large diameter round oriental ?
it could cut down on the echo and warm it up .
well i &apos;d rather we spend on what we have to right now .
window treatments .
mr. sacrimoni during the time period
beginning approximately january 1.1996 through today
were you employed by or associated with
the new york faction of an organized crime family of la cosa nostra ?
yes .
sacrimoni allocuted in federal court
admitting at least a 10 @-@ year connection with la cosa nostra .
