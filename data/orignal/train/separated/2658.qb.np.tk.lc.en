is there any sign of them ?
no , but don &apos;t slow down now .
did you get hurt back there ? either of you ?
i don &apos;t think so . i avoided the bullets , anyway .
well , you always wanted a shotgun wedding .
it &apos;s okay . it &apos;s all right .
we &apos;re gonna get through this , all right ?
all they did was stop a wedding .
they can &apos;t touch what we have .
reddington &apos;s lying to me . i know it .
if my mother wasn &apos;t trying to abduct me ,
why &apos;d solomon ask for masha ?
do you really think this woman is gonna hire a team of mercenaries
to kidnap her own daughter ?
if that woman knew reddington , she would .
she &apos;d know it &apos;s the only way to pry me out of his grip .
but where &apos;s she been all this time ?
and why &apos;d reddington say she &apos;s dead ?
well , i got a more pressing question for you --
where the hell are we going ?
team leader , this is operator 4 @-@ 6 .
i have eyes on tango ,
moving south on brightwood avenue . copy ?
i beg to differ . we &apos;ve got masha contained inside the church .
that &apos;s a big negative , team leader .
target is southbound in a festive black sedan .
suggest you break off current engagement .
all teams , continuous fire for 15 seconds ,
and then full withdrawal .
what are they doing ? !
they just realized she &apos;s gone .
they &apos;re keeping us pinned so they can launch a chase team .
you need to get out of here .
baz !
down !
they &apos;re pulling back .
they heard the sirens .
half of metro p.d. must be out there by now .
we got to get out there . let &apos;s go .
well , thanks to construction delays in columbia heights ,
i have a fixed position for tango .
sending the nav ... now .
hi ! congratulations .
yeah . best wishes .
okay , you promised to tell me what &apos;s going on .
who sent the army ?
are you okay ?
what do you think ?
that was supposed to be our wedding ?
who &apos;s honking ?
everyone .
tell tom to drive you to the mill shop on l street .
i &apos;ll send you the address and meet you there .
it &apos;s owned by a friend -- yong @-@ sun hopgood .
he &apos;ll provide safe haven .
we need to get you off the street quickly
before solomon finds you .
i &apos;ll take it under advisement .
son of a bitch . are you okay ?
i wish people would stop asking me that .
liz , what are you doing ?
don &apos;t worry . they &apos;re not gonna shoot me .
they &apos;re gonna get the tires . hang on .
liz , what the hell is wrong with you ?
give me that .
get down !
where &apos;d they go ?
there .
we &apos;ve got to keep moving .
no , tom , i can &apos;t run .
all right , all right , all right , i know .
in here .
okay , i &apos;m sorry .
i know you told me to stop asking if you &apos;re okay .
yeah , i know . i &apos;m not okay .
the car wreck . something hurts inside .
okay , hold on . let me find something for the pain .
demerol .
what about the baby ?
i don &apos;t know . i &apos;m not trained for this .
oh , my god . we &apos;re terrible parents .
team leader , police are approaching the area .
what is it ?
oh , my god , the baby !
no .
give me a shoutout .
no word on the escape vehicles yet .
we got federal , state , and local agencies in on the search ,
but media outlets have been alerted .
stay on it .
armor @-@ plated s.u.v.s don &apos;t just vanish .
look , i wouldn &apos;t count on it .
whoever gave solomon soldiers --
they gave him good ones .
i mean , they wore flexion gloves .
there &apos;s no fingerprints on anything , not even these .
green @-@ tipped . armor @-@ piercing .
and that &apos;s all they left behind .
they even dragged away their dead .
any word on keen ?
reddington &apos;s getting her to a safe house .
he &apos;ll notify us when she &apos;s landed .
i have something .
when dembe fought off one of the men ,
his helmet came off .
i found this earcom in one of the nearby pews .
it &apos;s like nothing i &apos;ve ever seen .
good work .
see if aram can track down the manufacturer .
our priority is to identify that attack team .
i need a little help here !
let &apos;s get her on a gurney .
what happened ?
oh , she was , uh , in a car accident
and she said she was fine and then she started bleeding .
how many months ?
uh , eight .
is the baby okay ?
we &apos;re gonna check her out . get an i.v. started .
send off a trauma panel . get her on a fetal monitor .
team leader , incoming from the north .
two metro p.d. cruisers . 40 seconds out .
operator 4 @-@ 6 , you got eyes on the target yet ?
negative . too many points of exit .
metro p.d. now 20 seconds out .
may i suggest you implement an exit strategy ?
she &apos;s hurt .
operator 4 @-@ 6 , where &apos;s the nearest hospital ?
vectoring you to mary margaret on central avenue ,
two blocks north of 27th .
your bleeding seems to have stopped on its own .
did the painkiller help ?
is the baby okay ?
that &apos;s all i care about .
that &apos;s all she cares about , but i need them both healthy .
well , the heartbeat looks okay , and baby &apos;s moving around .
all good signs .
but the o.b. &apos; s heading down now just to make sure .
now , in the meantime , we &apos;re gonna run some more tests ,
see if there was any other trauma from the accident .
thank you .
尼克披萨店
i don &apos;t want to talk to him .
what do you want ?
elizabeth . here . now .
i &apos;m right in front of the place . where is she ?
there was an accident .
is she hurt ?
we don &apos;t know .
i mean , we don &apos;t know how bad she --
she was bleeding . we &apos;re at mary margaret hospital .
can you put her on ?
what ?
you need to leave .
mr. kaplan will be there in five minutes to pick you up out back .
did you hear a word tom just said ?
i can &apos;t protect you in a hospital .
you can &apos;t protect me in a church , either .
let me rephrase that .
i cannot safeguard you
and the dozens of innocent patients and medical personnel
who &apos;ll be caught in the crossfire
when solomon and his storm troopers put together where you are .
i know how desperately you want to protect your baby , lizzy .
so think .
you &apos;ll be fine , sweetie . nothing to be afraid of .
i &apos;m taking you to a private icu
with the county &apos;s top emergency @-@ care team .
i know what that means .
i &apos;m right here .
i &apos;m right here .
what ?
my water just broke .
oh , wow . this is -- this is happening .
um , w @-@ w @-@ what is our eta ?
three minutes out .
from where ?
three minutes out from where ?
an abandoned warehouse ?
because i let a fugitive , a killer ,
a sociopath into my life ...
i know .
... now i am being hunted
by god knows who &apos;s chasing me ,
but they &apos;ve got body armor and assault rifles ,
and i have to give birth to my child -- to a baby --
in a filthy warehouse !
it &apos;s a nightclub .
is that supposed to make me feel better ?
no , it &apos;s not .
your baby deserves more than we can provide .
welcome , dr. korpal .
what have we got ?
a 31 @-@ year @-@ old female 32 weeks pregnant
status post mva with abdominal pain and bleeding .
r.h. status ?
unknown , but her labs are cooking .
okay , he &apos;s in .
i should have known it &apos;d be you on call .
liz , what happened ?
nothing good .
it &apos;s okay . let me take a look .
uh , since when are you an o.b. ?
as an e.r. physician ,
i &apos;m trained in the emergency aspect of all the specialties .
i saved your ass , didn &apos;t i ?
damn it , reddington . where &apos;s liz ?
circumstances prevent me
from sharing more information at this time , harold .
whoever employed solomon &apos;s services ,
they know too much .
they &apos;re breathing down our necks even now ,
listening , watching .
i can feel it .
who attacked us at the church ?
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m hoping your team finds something at the scene .
we need to put down this threat quickly .
i &apos;ll be in touch when i can .
hey , reddington , wait .
of course ,
it &apos;s a risk for all of us ,
but it &apos;s possible , right ?
what &apos;s possible ?
liz .
she suffered a placental abruption ,
likely from the crash .
it &apos;s when the placenta rips away from the walls of the uterus .
as a result , the baby &apos;s not getting enough oxygen .
the heart rate is plummeting .
if i don &apos;t perform an emergency c @-@ section
in the next 10 minutes ,
her baby &apos;s going to die .
it &apos;s pointless trying to identify a manufacturer .
that earcom is pure black market .
nitride transistor technology ,
a built @-@ in terahertz radio .
we &apos;re back to square one -- chasing shadow warriors .
uh , not exactly .
there were no prints on the outside of the earcom ,
but i pulled partial fingerprints
from the button battery inside .
asa jacobi .
first air cavalry brigade .
missing , presumed dead during the iraq war .
he left a wife behind .
track her down and pay her a visit .
see if there &apos;s anything there .
perimeter defense is in place --
exits , rooftops ,
and lookouts on all avenues of approach
for a six @-@ block radius .
everything will be fine , raymond .
oh , for god &apos;s sake , dembe ,
spare me the mystical reassurance .
everything is not fine .
where the hell was the perimeter defense at that damn church ?
you should have deployed four teams , five teams .
look at her lying there in this barbaric situation
with her child &apos;s life at risk .
everything is not fine .
she never should have been at that godforsaken church .
stop it , raymond !
this has little to do with dembe
and nothing to do with
that poor girl in there .
she &apos;s been telling you for months
that you &apos;re a danger to her baby .
this is on you , raymond .
nobody else .
you were wrong to make her believe you could keep her safe .
you made us all believe .
operator 4 @-@ 6 , this is team leader .
we lost the target .
last seen at mary margaret hospital .
do you have a visual ? over .
negative .
but fresh hospital intel just in .
&quot; suspected placental abruption with vaginal bleeding .
variable fetal deceleration present . &quot;
sounds like tango &apos;s about to pop out a bun .
given her medical condition , she can &apos;t be far away .
let &apos;s canvass these areas .
as soon as i get this epidural in ,
you &apos;re gonna feel a whole lot better .
okay .
and we &apos;ll be ready to go .
and you get to stay awake the whole time .
really ?
okay .
why is she in so much pain ?
her baby &apos;s not receiving enough oxygen .
it &apos;s fighting to stay alive inside her womb .
trust me , that &apos;s a good thing , but i need to work fast .
push another five of morphine .
nik , please just tell me ,
nothing &apos;s gonna happen to the baby .
the moment you hear your baby cry ,
you &apos;ll know that everything &apos;s going to be okay .
now , you &apos;re gonna feel some pressure as i insert the needle .
take a deep breath .
just stay with me , all right ? i &apos;m right here .
it &apos;s fine . we &apos;re having a baby .
i love you .
you &apos;re gonna do great .
this just isn &apos;t how i pictured the birth of our baby .
how &apos;d you picture it ?
magical .
okay , hold on .

sometimes they just need a reminder it &apos;s time to breathe .
all right .
congratulations .
you have a healthy , beautiful baby girl .
hi !
a girl !
hi .
i still like agnes .
you know my feelings .
besides reliving childhood traumas ,
it &apos;s an old lady name .
but with babies , everything that &apos;s old is new again .
besides ,
it was sam &apos;s mother &apos;s name .
he &apos;s the only family i ever knew .
congratulations , elizabeth .
may i see her ?
no . get out .
please , go away . make him go away .
it &apos;s been a long day . she &apos;s had a lot of drugs .
it &apos;s not the drugs .
this is my daughter .
i &apos;m begging you .
just wait out here .
let me talk to her .
congratulations .
agent navabi found asa jacobi &apos;s wife .
she &apos;s living in phoenix ,
and she has had no contact with her husband
since he went missing .
a dead end .
no .
for the first few years after his disappearance ,
she got a series of unusual phone calls .
she could hear breathing on the line ,
but the caller wouldn &apos;t speak .
prank calls aren &apos;t unusual .
they are when they always fall on your wedding anniversary .
so i traced the wife &apos;s phone records .
those calls were all made on pay phones ,
but they were paid for with calling cards .
you find a billing address ?
yep , and the accounts used to pay those bills
also paid for this
mid @-@ century columbia heights charmer .
been under single ownership for the past 20 years ,
only there is no owner .
it &apos;s an alias .
get ressler and samar there now .
we &apos;re clear !
clear !
looks like no one &apos;s home .
downstairs !
go .
what the hell is this place ?
keep an eye on things here . i &apos;m gonna get some air .
liz , she &apos;s beautiful .
i &apos;m sorry , dembe .
i know , raymond .
what is it ?
doctor .
doctor .
what &apos;s wrong ?
my chest .
hey , she can &apos;t breathe .
give me the baby .
what &apos;s wrong with her ?
o2 levels are dropping . get her some oxygen .
i need a stat ekg , cardiac panel ,
and a vq scan .
ekg stat .
what &apos;s happening ?
i have to get back to you on that .
nik , do something .
i checked with aram .
those cables belong to
a cross @-@ country fiber @-@ optic network .
whoever tapped them can intercept digital communications
across half the eastern seaboard .
hold on . something &apos;s happening .
i think someone &apos;s shutting it off .
已断开
team leader , one of your men was just compromised .
his tactical error
just led the fbi to one of our fiber taps .
and due to inherent security risks ,
he cannot be allowed to remain in the field .
what kind of error ?
i believe he lost his earcom .
which one of you lost his earpiece ?
that &apos;d be me , sir .
well , it &apos;s been found .
oh , good . yeah .
when you fall prey to errors ,
you become prey .
somebody clean that up .
the scan confirmed my fear .
the placental abruption caused amniotic fluid to leak into liz &apos;s blood ,
producing a severe inflammatory reaction .
are you with me , liz ?
i &apos;m gonna put you on a bipap machine .
it forces your lungs to expand and helps you breathe , okay ?
i &apos;ll be right back .
i need to be straightforward .
the bipap is a band @-@ aid .
the amniotic fluid will cause liz &apos;s lungs to swell .
the next stop is heart failure .
no .
she needs to be intubated and put on a ventilator as soon as possible .
you mean induce a medical coma .
i know it sounds scary ,
but it &apos;ll allow us to control her breathing
and force oxygen into her system .
i just don &apos;t have that equipment here .
tell mr. kaplan whatever you need .
we &apos;ll have it here immediately .
liz .
it &apos;s okay .
we &apos;re gonna need you to take slow , deep breaths .
breathe with the machine .
just breathe , babe . just breathe .
that looks right . okay , let &apos;s go .
we need it in o.r. now .
pull up 20 of etomidate and 100 of sux .
liz , you can do this .
when you wake up , i &apos;m gonna take you away from here .
we &apos;re gonna be lying on a beach under the sun .
just you , me , and our little baby girl .
i promise you .
if things go sideways ,
you &apos;re gonna take our baby to that beach , right ?
don &apos;t say that . they won &apos;t go sideways .
we have too much to look forward to .
i need to put you under now .
you &apos;re about to get very sleepy .
once she &apos;s tubed , i &apos;ll need
a post chest intubation x @-@ ray and a.b.g ..
i &apos;m sorry i kicked you out .
it wasn &apos;t fair after all you &apos;ve done for me .
i &apos;ve done nothing for you , lizzy .
i &apos;m scared for my little girl .
push the meds .
it &apos;s the children whom the world almost breaks
who grow up to save it .
i don &apos;t want that for her .
i wasn &apos;t talking about her .
i was talking about you , elizabeth .
oh , raymond .
i do love ...
do something !
we &apos;ve maxed out the vent settings .
her lungs are too damaged . they &apos;re shutting down .
there &apos;s nothing more i can do here .
&quot; here . &quot; what do you mean , &quot; here &quot; ?
in the hospital , there &apos;s a device called the ecmo .
it allows us to oxygenate her blood out--
can we get one here ?
there &apos;s no time .
then we &apos;re going to the hospital .
tell the paramedics we &apos;ll need the ambulance .
solomon knows we haven &apos;t left the city .
we have to assume they &apos;re monitoring the area .
a convoy traveling at high speed ...
you &apos;ll be intercepted and attacked
before you can get there .
i &apos;ll handle that .
i want a full protective detail to stay on site .
i &apos;ll ride in the ambulance , stay with liz .
i still have the browning , but i need clips .
no , you stay here .
like hell i &apos;m staying here .
she &apos;s my wife -- will be my wife .
and she &apos;d insist you stay and protect her child .
you &apos;re a father now .
morgan , i have something for you and danny .
whatever you need , boss .
cooper .
we have a medical emergency .
we &apos;re at 1438 west randall ,
laying a course for mary margaret hospital .
we &apos;ll be duck hunting .
i can have an escort there in six minutes .
we don &apos;t have six minutes .
you &apos;re gonna have to meet us on the way .
we &apos;re losing her , harold .
we &apos;re losing elizabeth .
team leader , i have eyes on a white ambulance
heading south on randall &apos;s lane at high speed .
none have been officially dispatched in that grid .
solid copy , operator 4 @-@ 6 .
are they taking the on @-@ ramp to the highway ?
unclear . without that data node , i have blind spots .
all teams on map grid 32 @-@ v ,
tango in a white ambulance .
find them .
what &apos;s her status ?
blood pressure and heart rate are crashing .
i &apos;m giving her atropine now .
i want a dopamine drip on standby .
keep her heart beating , niko .
please , just keep her heart beating .
recycle her blood pressure now and every five minutes .
aram , where are we going , pal ?
we need eyes . take us to keen .
yeah , hang on .
i just got a visual on her ambulance .
charting intercept course .
okay , take your next left .
i &apos;m gonna route you around traffic .
team leader , the target location has been acquired .
pulling up coordinates now .
routing you south @-@ southwest on langford .
target in white ford ambulance .
dopamine .
hands in the air !
hands in the air ! step out !
what &apos;s going on ? we &apos;re just responding to a call .
what do you mean , the wrong ambulance ?
use your tinkertoys and find the right one .
they &apos;re making fools of us .
patience is our ally , team leader .
searching for the precious cargo now .
cooper said something about duck hunting .
what did he mean ?
a decoy . they &apos;re using a decoy .
how much farther to the hospital ?
2.1 / 2 miles .
an ecmo team is standing by to receive her .
her heart &apos;s barely contracting .
if she &apos;s not on bypass within the next few minutes ...
oh , my god .
engage targets , but do not kill elizabeth keen .
the driver &apos;s been hit .
squeeze every five seconds .

i &apos;m losing her .
no , you &apos;re not .
she &apos;s not responding to medication .
then do something else .

i &apos;m so sorry .
back up !
go on , back up ! keep everyone away !
you need to leave , raymond .
the police are here .
raymond .
i don &apos;t want elizabeth in the morgue .
i want our people to handle this .
i &apos;ll take care of everything .
this way . come on .
i got you .
it &apos;s okay .
i should have stayed with her .
there &apos;s nothing you could have done .
was she in pain ?
at the end ?
no . she never woke up .
i can &apos;t do this alone .
without her .
i don &apos;t know what to do .
you &apos;ll learn fast .
do you mind ?
her name is agnes .
that &apos;s a good name .
