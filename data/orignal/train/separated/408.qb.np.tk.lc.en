hey ok now is not the time to play .

paul .
paul .
paul !
paul !
call 911 !
this is captain paul collins .
he &apos;s the third victim in 2 weeks
in providence rhode island .
captain ?
yeah he just returned home 2 weeks ago
from his fourth tour in iraq .
he &apos;s a decorated war hero .
was he targeted because he &apos;s in the military ?
no . just like the first two victims
he was targeted because he was convenient .
he was killed at a church during an early service .
neck was cut open severed the carotid artery .
bled out in a matter of moments .
right in front of his daughter .
murder in a church is highly symbolic .
is there a religious agenda involved ?
the detective on the case jake moreland
ruled that out because of the first two victims .
the first victim mike o &apos;donnell was found
under a sink in the men &apos;s room at a restaurant .
what kind of restaurant ?
local place white tablecloths and jug wine .
the second victim karen lagrassa
was killed at the laundromat .
all 3 had their throats slashed .
aside from m.o.
the victimology &apos;s all over the place .
it &apos;s like this guy doesn &apos;t care who he &apos;s killing
just how .
and he &apos;s doing it in public
without compunction for who sees him .
do we have a sketch ?
all anyone can agree on
is that it &apos;s a white male between 25 and 40 .
well that narrows it down to all of providence .
hard to fault the witnesses
given how bloody these murders must be .
what bothers me is the cooling off period
is getting shorter and shorter
with no attempt to hide who he is or what he &apos;s doing .
i mean an unsub this bold
could be suffering from a major psychotic break .
i already asked detective moreland to pull recent releases
on prisons and mental hospitals .
we need to get to providence asap .
whether he &apos;s suffering a psychotic break or not
this could be the start of a spree .
and anyone is a potential target .
&quot; show me a hero
and i will write you tragedy . &quot;
f. scott fitzgerald .
why is he using a knife ?
guns assure the highest number of fatalities .
if all he &apos;s interested in is quantity
he could be doing this more efficiently .
he could be training .
spree killers often to dry runs
before they start their rampage .
most spree killers have lost control by the time they begin .
they &apos;re always male .
and if they don &apos;t fall into the school shooter category
they &apos;re older
40s and 50s socially isolated .
the stressor &apos;s usually the dissolution
of their last social outlet .
george hennard was inspired by james huberty .
between the two of them
they shot 43 people at fast food restaurants .
well if he &apos;s practicing for his mass murder
he &apos;s definitely getting bolder about it .
and bloodier .
right now the shock and awe of the bloodletting
seems to be what he &apos;s going for .
but soon that won &apos;t be enough .
that makes sense with regards to his fantasy life .
if he is planning something big
he &apos;ll spend his day dreaming of it
getting back at slights
both real and imagined .
without a specific target victim
we need to concentrate on the crime scenes
and see what they tell us .
prentiss you take the laundromat .
i &apos;ll have detective moreland meet you there .
i &apos;d like to take a look at the church
if you don &apos;t mind .
good . jj you and morgan
interview captain collins &apos; wife .
she got the best look at the unsub .
see what she remembers .
reid and i will run point from the police station .
agent rossi ?
you must be father kendellen .
thank you for coming so quickly .
it &apos;s the last we can do father .
to be honest
i &apos;ve been struggling to understand all this .
it &apos;s been ... trying .
i don &apos;t like to see crime tape
in front of church doors .
i can &apos;t imagine how you feel .
ash wednesday &apos;s next week .
these doors should never be closed to the community .
to be honest agent hotchner
when they told me bau was coming
i expected more than two agents .
the rest of the agents went straight to the crime scenes .
i believe there &apos;ll be information there
that may determine where the unsub will strike next .
as soon as you can i &apos;d like you to meet
agent prentiss at the laundromat .
yeah sure .
any idea on where he may hit next ?
we can double patrols .
it &apos;s honestly too early to tell .
well your gut must be telling you something .
well this far he &apos;s struck at a restaurant bathroom
a laundromat and a church .
he chooses his victims not out of preference
but of favorable circumstance .
with each kill he &apos;s growing bolder
telling us he doesn &apos;t care who sees him .
so next time it &apos;ll be even more public .
yes . our technical analyst
is compiling a list of public events
that your department should be monitoring .
garcia are you there ?
wired for sound and ready for action .
what have you got so far ?
well you got your &quot; sesame street on ice &quot;
your harlem globetrotters your beatles cover bands
not to mention the dozens of college bars
and late @-@ night hangouts frequented by the youth of america .
no event is too big or too small .
good . keep going .
aye aye cap &apos;n .
no respect even now .
i do the talking .
no comment no comment no comment .
what &apos;s the fbi &apos;s involment in the investigation
no comment .
in the murder of captain collins ?
we are strictly here just to advise the providence police department .
is the collins murder tied to
the other two stabbings of last week ?
and when they are ready to make their statement they &apos;ll let you know .
thank you .
they &apos;ve been out there all day .
some of my friends wanted to come by
they didn &apos;t want to be on the 6 : 00 news .
your husband &apos;s a hero . unfortunately
the circumstances of his death has caused this to be a media circus .
well you &apos;d think they &apos;d show a little--
what did i tell you sophia ?
get away from the window .
are we going to be on tv ?
not if i can help it .
go in your room and play .
i &apos;ll be there in a sec .
i spent years waiting for a phone call
or one of those letters they used to hand @-@ deliver
to dead soldiers &apos; wives .
they want to know if i want to bury paul
at--at arlington
but i don &apos;t have--
ok .
i know you have a job to do .
let &apos;s do this so it &apos;s done right .
that &apos;s what paul would say .
what do you need to know ?
it happened right here .
you told the police you weren &apos;t sure
when the unsub walked in ?
yes .
i don &apos;t know .
one moment he wasn &apos;t there and then he was .
all right let &apos;s walk through the mass .
you told the police that you were late .
they came in during the first reading .
you know most of your parishioners on sight ?
yes .
but not the unsub right ?
no .
i don &apos;t know how i could have missed him .
you know the collins family personally right ?
of course .
i mean paul he grew up at this school .
whenever he came home he made sure to come to mass .
and they sat there in the back
so as not to disturb the mass ?
yes .
once they were settled
could you see them ?
no .
then let yourself off the hook father .
if you couldn &apos;t see the collins family
you couldn &apos;t see the killer .
no .
but he was definitely there by communion ?
yes .
not before ?
i don &apos;t remember .
all right . meg we can take a break if you need to take a break .
hey . what is it sweetie ?
i shook his hand .
when was that ?
when we all say &quot; peace be with you &quot; and we shake hands .
i shook his hand .
that &apos;s right .
she &apos;s right .
during the sign of the peace .
he touched my baby . he--
oh god . he t--he touched my baby .
meg i know this is difficult .
but i want you to try and focus .
ok ? stay with me .
i need you to tell me what happened during communion .
we all got up .
who got out first paul ?
yes .
but he let me and sophia go first .
paul always goes last .
we--we took communion
and we--we went back and we uh ...
we ...
that &apos;s ok .
we &apos;re almost done .
you &apos;re doing great .
paul was on your right .
sophia was on your left .
what happened ?
she was playing .
and after communion you pray .
i leaned down and i told her that .
so you were facing to your left away from paul
away from the killer .
you never see him coming you never see him go .
i need a break .
of course .
i want to stay here .
meg might recall ...
more and even if she doesn &apos;t
what she &apos;s going through ...
what &apos;s wrong ?
this unsub isn &apos;t psychotic
and he &apos;s not gonna go on a spree .
he &apos;s too patient .
ok but ...
what is he trying to accomplish ?
i don &apos;t know .
get the stuff out ...
all right i &apos;m folding ...
i don &apos;t hear you approaching .
you always talk to yourself ?
good . if these machines were on
i definitely wouldn &apos;t hear you come up behind me .
jake moreland providence p.d.
emily prentiss .
great . can you do that again ?
sure .
ok .
you come in through the back door
slash my throat walk out .
there &apos;s no cameras inside or outside of the building .
the same is true for all the crime scenes .
which means you &apos;re smart enough
to plan for that in your attacks .
but careless enough to drop a knife 10 feet
after i cut you .
but you didn &apos;t leave any fingerprints .
no . he did that at all 3 crime scenes .
mass murderers and spree killers
they often fetishize their weapons
but this guy discards his . why ?
he can get a new knife anytime he wants .
they carry these at army / navy stores .
it could be a scare tactic .
hoso ?
americans typically are more terrified
by the presence of a knife than a gun .
the most of the rape victims for instance
they &apos;re more likely to scream out for help if they see a gun
whereas they &apos;ll comply if they see a blade .
so victimology and murder weapon
aren &apos;t important to this guy .
what does that leave ?
what is he attacking ?
the crime scene itself .
did you see the sign outside when this place was established ?
1967 .
the same as the restaurant .
second generation italian .
everyone in the neighborhood eats there .
st. alvina &apos;s was built at the beginning of the last century .
so each location has a history in this community .
so he wants to destroy landmarks
pieces of providence &apos;s history .
that &apos;s why the random victims .
he &apos;s making a point .
probably the manifestation
of a deep hatred for the city .
he wants to scar the places
everybody knows and goes to .
not quite . take a ride with me .
we &apos;re gonna have a look at the other crime scenes .
why ?
indulge me .
attack an institution everybody responds .
neighbors come out the mayor assigns extra cops .
a place of worship turns into a crime scene
you feel personally assaulted .
that &apos;s what gets him off .
the response . public outcry .
he wants the big show .
you think he &apos;s revisiting the crime scenes ?
not just revisiting .
reliving .
he &apos;s found a way to keep the murders he &apos;s committed
fresh because they &apos;re always on the city &apos;s mind .
&quot; witnesses say they didn &apos;t see it happen
were alerted by the screams of the victim &apos;s wife and daughter . &quot;
man alive in a church .
this guy he ain &apos;t afraid of nothin &apos; .
need anything ?
i &apos;m gonna grab a smoke .
careful connie those things &apos;ll kill ya .
careful it &apos;s hot .
oh good . &apos; cause i love my tea really warm .
would you like some cream and sugar with your tea too ?
please .
that &apos;s how miss tuffet likes her tea too .
thank you .
it &apos;s good .
but i think sophia &apos;s tea is a little bit better .
thank you .
how many do you have ?
you &apos;re too good at this not to be a mom .
one . a boy .
sophia &apos;s first communion is supposed to be next week .
she &apos;ll do great .
oh . excuse me .
hey rossi .
we &apos;re just getting ready to deliver the profile
but i need you to do something .
i understand .
ok uh call me when you find out more .
bye .
sophia mommy and agent jareau need some privacy ok ?
thank you for the tea .
you &apos;re welcome .
i know that tone of voice .
it &apos;s always followed by bad news .
you should know a lot of these guys need to feel powerful .
producing a spectacle gives them that sense of pride .
i &apos;m trying to quell that by controlling the circus outside .
is he watching us ?
maybe .
we think he revisits his crime scenes .
it &apos;s possible the media could have brought him here .
he won &apos;t shake my daughter &apos;s hand this time if he does .
it &apos;s possible we
suggest that you &apos; ve think of this unsub here .
not as a slasher but as an arsonist .
because the gratification he &apos;s getting
isn &apos;t from the physical act of murder
but from the public &apos;s reaction to it .
arsonists draw attention to themselves
through the fires they set .
the location they choose are highly symbolic to them
while this unsub will never set an actual fire
he has the same psychosis as one who does .
our unsub fits that model .
his locations have been pillars of the community .
the victims he picks aren &apos;t as important as the effect
of killing them outside of your favorite restaurant
or place of worship .
by picking locales with the highest visibility
he &apos;s creating the highest level of fear in that neighborhood
which reinforces his feeling of power .
yeah but arsonists don &apos;t set out to hurt people .
this guy clearly does .
that &apos;s true . and this unsub
definitely falls in the category of sociopath .
his victims are there only to achieve his goal .
he doesn &apos;t have the ability to empathize with them .
to him they &apos;re just tools for him to use
no different than a can of gasoline and a match .
i &apos;ll talk to you later sweetie .
i &apos;m just at the market right now .
all right . i love you too .
but even how he kills tells us something .
slashing a throat is a messy visual act .
it &apos;s designed to create attention
just like a fire .
arsonists are often mission based .
they need make sure their first fire has burnt out
before they set another one .
are these organic ?
yeah .
you know i think i have a fresher bunch of those
back in the truck . holdn one second .
they &apos;re also highly disciplined and focused .
if conditions aren &apos;t right to set a fire
or in this case slash a throat they &apos;ll move on .
you know i &apos;m sorry i don &apos;t .
which actually makes this your lucky day .
if you want to get something else
these hydrangeas are perfect .
they have to go home with somebody .
i &apos;ll give them to you for half .
they &apos;re beautiful . absolutely i &apos;ll take them .
blue for your eyes . how about that ?
in addition to his need to kill
he has self @-@ control .
he has a short cooling off period
because he &apos;s enjoying what he &apos;s doing .
this in turn feeds his ego
and keeps him covering his tracks .
this makes him even more dangerous .
if he gets frustrated encounters too many obstacles
or suffers a blow to his narcissistic ego
he could go on an all @-@ out rampage .
focus on men between jobs
instead of working consistently
he is hunting at his next location .
and he &apos;s revisiting his old scenes .
we recommend you--
yeah .
the news crews are leaving the collins &apos; house .
he &apos;s killed again .
yeah . farmers market at third and shelby .
the press are already on their way .
we could use that .
it &apos;ll feed his ego .
he &apos;ll want to stay and watch .
ladies and gentlemen when you get to the crime scene
we need you to canvass the crowd .
pay particular attention to onlookers who might be
more interested in the scene itself than the victim .
and get photographs of everyone .
excuse me .
jj i need you there .
no hotch i-- i can &apos;t leave .
jj you &apos;re there to control the media .
they &apos;ve left to cover the crime scene
which may distract the unsub .
we can catch him but i need you on top of the press
making sure they &apos;re focused on our goals and not the unsub &apos;s .
jj .
yeah . i &apos;m on my way .
i &apos;m so sorry .
it &apos;s ok . i know that tone of voice too .
somebody died ?
oh my god .
what happened ?
i bet it was that stabber .
stabber ? what stabber ?
you know the guy who &apos;s been cutting
people &apos;s throats open around town .
right . him .
come with me sir .
what ?
what ?
come on .
wait what ?
let &apos;s go .
providence police .
go ahead emily .
hey rossi i got a trail of blood here
but i haven &apos;t found the knife yet .
he ran away .
see where it ends .
got it .
we can &apos;t run this locally .
run ? it &apos;s ran it &apos;s gone .
cnn &apos;s leading with this in 3 hours .
minimize his impact .
do not give him a name .
it &apos;ll just encourage him to kill more .
am i making this deal for full access ?
of course .
just attribute the good work to the providence p.d.
and leave us out of it .
he was just a nice guy who worked here .
i &apos;d seen him here before but never bought anything from him .
what do you remember about the attack ?
i asked if his flowers were organic .
i turned away and the next thing i know
i felt something warm . it was blood .
did you get a look at the guy with the knife ?
the first person i saw was a guy screaming for help
and he was trying to stop the bleeding .
a bunch of people ran over there trying to help
and i think i just stood there screaming .
back up for a second .
who was shouting ?
i don &apos;t know some guy .
when i turned around he was holding the poor man up
trying to get someone to notice .
this guy must have got a lot of blood on him yeah ?
yeah sure i guess .
all right thank you for your time .
officer .
go ahead emily .
i found out where that blood trail ended .
and ?
the unsub changed his clothes .
he left his blood @-@ soaked ones here in the trash .
he &apos;s avoided getting blood on himself up to now .
what changed ?
i don &apos;t know but whatever his reason
he came prepared .
he knew he would be bloody this time .
i &apos;ll get back to you .
what do you got morgan ?
a witness says the first responder a citizen
cried out for help maybe 2 seconds after the stabbing .
he was the unsub .
i think so .
he &apos;s not content with revisiting the crime scene anymore
he needs to be part of them .
detective !
yeah .
establish a perimeter around the market .
put your men no more an 20 feet apart .
every cop needs to be in sight of one another .
whoa wait a minute . what ?
the unsub is still here .
are you sure ?
start by separating the men from the women .
we found discarded clothes .
that &apos;s how we find him . we match by body type .
all right i &apos;m on it . gardella come on .
copy that .
connor is that you ?
hey liddy .
what are you going ?
i gotta get back to the diner .
well you &apos;re gonna be late .
we gotta detain everyone inside here .
oh come on . how many hamburgers have let slide ?
just following orders buddy . let &apos;s go .
you gotta explain to sal when i &apos;m late .
yeah yeah your customers won &apos;t starve .
those gotta be on the board too ?
what &apos;s the next great bit of advice from the fbi huh ?
take it easy gardella . this ain &apos;t the time or the place .
if we hadn &apos;t listened to them
liddy and i would be havg our morning cup of coffee .
we profiled that he was mission oriented
and this kill doesn &apos;t fit that pattern .
the murder of officer liddy is a significant departure
even for someone as unpredictable as this unsub .
this was a murder of self @-@ preservation just to get away .
this location is not his m.o.
secluded with no audience stabbing not cutting .
so ?
so he &apos;s out prowling the streets right now
looking for another victim so the city will pay atteion to him .
you &apos;ve been handed a list of locations
that we think might be of particular interest to the unsub .
we &apos;re asking you to double and
even triple your surveillance in these areas .
keep your wits about you guys .
detective we &apos;d like to speak to you .
sure .
that &apos;s it fellas . thank you .
detective the story has become about officer liddy .
we need to get the attention back on the unsub
or we &apos;re afraid that he may lash out .
up till now the unsub has been disciplined enough
to avoid killing if the circumstances weren &apos;t right .
like an arsonist who won &apos;t set a fire if there &apos;s someone there
to see him leaving while smoke is billowing out the windows .
what if we say that one of the buildings didn &apos;t burn ?
how would the unsub react to that ?
he &apos;d be compelled to come back and finish the job .
then we pick one of the previous locations
show that the community has rallied around it
that they are not afraid of him .
so we need to find a location
with the greatest symbolism up to this point .
that &apos;s easy .
and we use the city &apos;s fallen hero
as inspiration .
should we get the chief of police or the mayor
to make a statement ? it could help with inspiring people .
we &apos;ve got something better .
captain collins &apos; widow .
i--i cannot ask her to do that .
she &apos;s highly visible and she &apos;s someone
with whom the entire city can sympathize .
when she tells the city not to be afraid to come back to church
the unsub can &apos;t ignore that .
and what happens if this draws the unsub to meg ?
we keep her with us .
we &apos;ll take the bastard down .
you want me to read this
in front of cameras ?
yes .
will my husband &apos;s killer be there ?
most likely he &apos;ll watch it on tv .
you &apos;ll have police protection around you at all times .
no .
i won &apos;t do it .
meg please .
we need you .
you represent paul &apos;s memory .
i represent sophia .
paul &apos;s given enough .
so have i.
yes sir .
no i understand . thank you .
that was the mayor . he won &apos;t sign off on a press conference
at st. alvina .
and jj couldn &apos;t make any headway with meg collins .
how long has it been since officer liddy was stabbed ?
16 hours .
well if the unsub was going to go out on a spree
he would have done it by now . why hasn &apos;t he ?
he killed a cop . he &apos;s laying low .
may be . but we &apos;ve profiled this guy like an arsonist .
it &apos;s the aftermath that matters not the act .
you think he &apos;s feeding off
the grief of the police department instead ?
if so then he &apos;s found something new to get off on .
detective .
hold on a second . yeah ?
i need a list of establishments
where your officers socialize--
bars restaunts pool halls everything you &apos;ve got .
sure right . eddie let me get back to you .
another round guys ?
yeah . we &apos;re off the clock anyways .
one more for liddy boys .
here &apos;s to a great cop .
we &apos;ll get this bastard for you joe .
yeah the fbi gonna help you do that ?
we don &apos;t need a profile
to know the kind of guy we &apos;re dealing with .
a coward .
he stabs a cop in the dark
and runs away like a vermin .
gutless .
no kiddin &apos; .
comrades i have amassed employment records for police hangouts .
what do you want me took for ?
white males 25 to 30 .
i &apos;m gonna need more than that .
arsonists typically have a stronger relationship
with their mothers than their fathers
so let &apos;s look for single @-@ mother households
with a history of abuse bad divorce or paternal violence .
manifestations in the son too garcia
like juvenile arrests heavy crimes
a significant drop in grades .
thank you boys . that will do .
oh this looks like something .
what do you have ?
connor o &apos;brien .
his dad went to prison for--
oh lordy--not only setting mom &apos;s apartment on fire
but making it look like it was an accident
so he could collect on the insurance .
rned his kid &apos;s mother for a few bucks ?
yeah . and then connor testified .
and his father was trailed .
he was 10 .
where &apos;s o &apos;brien now ?
he works at the quality cafe .
guys it &apos;s across the street .
thanks garcia .
where &apos;s connor o &apos;brien ? fbi .
connie ? he just stepped out about 10 minutes ago .
did you see which way he went ?
he just went out to grab a smoke . why
garcia i need o &apos;brien &apos;s home address .
what are you guys doing here ?
we were done with our shifts .
we poured one out for liddy .
did you talk to him about the recent mders ?
of course . we said we &apos;d catch the coward .
you disparaged him .
1121 admiral apartment 16 .
it &apos;s the other side of town .
dave you and morgan meet prentiss and s.w.a.t. on site .
connor o &apos;brien !
clear !
he &apos;s not coming back here .
he &apos;s gonna make his last stand .
he &apos;s still gonna need to know he &apos;s foremost on everyone &apos;s mind .
guys !
it looks like he &apos;s got every article that was printed
about his mom &apos;s death .
he has the prayer card from her funeral .
birthday cards .
look all of them signed by his mom not by his father .
look at this .
that &apos;s a lot of hate .
his old man is already in prison . he can &apos;t attack him .
so he goes after the places that remind him of his father .
the only way he can get through to his dad is with violence .
william o &apos;brien aka billy os .
was a connected guy who specialized in turning faulty wiring
into a 3 @-@ alarm fire .
because of connor &apos;s testimony
he was given a life sentence
for the murder of his wife
but it was recently reduced
to the possibility of parole in 5 years .
when was the sentence reduced ?
one month ago .
just before the murders started .
there &apos;s our stressor .
why would he do this to get
back at his father if he &apos;s already in jail ?
somebody &apos;s gotta pay .
he &apos;s a tough guy now .
hey wake up .
wake up !
your mother &apos;s dead .
time to go .
but dad you said i could--
i said let &apos;s go !
it &apos;s ok honey .
just give me one more minute we &apos;ll be out of here .
yeah thanks eddie .
damn it .
where ?
library about a mile from here .
mother was found next to her crying baby .
is the baby ok ?
not a scratch but they haven &apos;t found the knife yet .
it &apos;s his memento now . he won &apos;t stop until he &apos;s killed
as many people as possible .
we have to go to our original plan--
create an event he can &apos;t resist coming to .
he has to believe he was unsuccessful .
if he won &apos;t go back to his apartment and i don &apos;t think
he &apos;s gonna revisit the crime scenes .
the mother from the library ? she &apos;s already gone .
she bled out at the scene . the emts stopped working on her .
tell them to keep trying to resuscitate her .
but she &apos;s dead .
yeah but the unsub doesn &apos;t know that .
tell the press she made it she &apos;s hanging on for dear life .
and we organize a candlelight vigil for her tonight .
if he &apos;s mission oriented and he thinks she &apos;s still alive
he &apos;ll have to come back for her .
and we &apos;ll be there .
let the husband know what &apos;s going on
so he &apos;s aware .
have the press there . tell them to go live
and to keep the focus on us as much as they can .
mrs. collins .
the woman who was just attacked ...
she was a mother ?
yes .
what can i do to help ?
we are live at the latest crime scene
where the fbi is facilitating what appears to be ...
officer ! move this crowd to that corner
and pin them behind the police barricades .
we &apos;ve got a female about 30
her throat &apos;s been slashed she &apos;s hanging on .
there &apos;s a vascular surgeon standing by at the hospital .
yeah one two is your change .
thank you .
can i help you ?
a pack of smokes . uh c @-@ could you turn that up ?
... crime scene where the fbi is facilitating
what appears to be a rescue attempt of the most recent victim .
they are rushing her into an ambulance now .
make some room please !
right this way guys .
how &apos;s she doing ?
we &apos;ve got her stabilized sir .
they &apos;re coming through . please clear it out .
can we clear a path please .
officers i want a 5 @-@ car escort for the ambulance
to the hospital .
as you can see she is still alive
and being rushed to the hospital now .
looks like she &apos;s ok .
no no that &apos;s im-- that &apos;s not possible .
as many of you know
my husband captain paul collins
was murdered this past sunday .
the support i have received has been inspiring .
which is why i &apos;m asking everyone
to support the latest victim julia vecchia
who is fighting for her life right now
at st. frazier &apos;s hospital .
it &apos;s that wife of the soldier who got killed .
on behalf of my husband
we are asking you to come together
at st . frazier &apos;s to hold a candlelight vigil tonight .
please help restore this great city ...
look at her . kid &apos;s got a lot of heart .
thank you .
you think this &apos;ll work ?
it should . we &apos;ve shifted the public &apos;s focus
from connor to his victim .
that should make him angry enough to show up
and try to do something about it .
i got a twine of our suspect .
connor o &apos;brien ?
roll in now . go go .
put your hands where i can see them and get down on the ground !
hey ! fbi !
stop right there !
stop ! moving ! stop fighting !
stop fighting !
stop !
that &apos;s enough ! it &apos;s over ! that &apos;s enough !
she &apos;s dead ! there no possible way she could have survived !
connor o &apos;brien you &apos;re under arrest .
we know why you came down here .
do you ?
i had to make sure .
she--she &apos;s dead right ?
what are you smiling at ? you &apos;re going to jail .
in jail they treat cop killers like kings .
first you gotta see how we treat &apos; em at the station .
get him out of here .
it &apos;s hard to believe that guy was so starved for attention
that he murdered all those people just to one @-@ up s father .
i spoke with detective moreland about connor &apos;s father billy os .
he said the older police knew to give him a wide berth .
he didn &apos;t say much but when he did ...
people listened .
the adult version of a bully .
there are lots of ways that sons defeat their fathers .
i just keep getting ph.d.s.
does the son of a sociopath ever really have a chance ?
you know o &apos;brien committed his
crimes in the same jurisdiction as his father .
it &apos;s only a matter of time before he &apos;s put in the same prison .
william shakespeare wrote
&quot; when a father gives to his son both laugh .
&quot; when a son gives to his father
both cry . &quot;
hey dad .
well well well .
