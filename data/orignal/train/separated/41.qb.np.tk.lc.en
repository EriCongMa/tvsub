arthur gibson , 52 .
worked as a sells manager for industrial machinery manufacturer .
married ?
no . divorced .
next . we need someone at our table .
deborah barber , 38 .
next .
why ?
not sympathetic enough .
really ?
is there a weight limit on sympathy ?
uh , maureen fenton .
housewife . divorced and remarried .
one daughter , 18 .
how did she do it ?
handgun .
killed her husband , then herself .
what &apos;s the daughter look like ?
she signed on to the class action ?
one of the first .
how will she do on the stand ?
good .
then that &apos;s our test case .
make sure she wears the cross .
but i thought mr. yates was doing it .
we thought so , too , but he got cold feet .
we know this is very last minute , caitlin ,
but we think mrg pharmaceuticals is ready to settle .
we just need a strong test case to motivate them .
if i lose , the others can &apos;t sue , right ?
well , they can sue , but it will be harder .
but i &apos;ll have to be on the stand ?
it &apos;s a good case , caitlin . really good .
and we need to make sure
they never make an antidepressant like that again .
sometimes i wonder if god forgives her , you know ?
i have these nightmares of mom not in heaven .
your mom didn &apos;t do this , caitlin . the pills did .
you need to remember that .
i know .
thank you .
oh , say can you see by the dawn &apos;s early light ...
of course , she has perfect pitch .
and this is bad , how ?
it &apos;s at the end .
she gives ten percent to her church .
she works at a food kitchen once a month .
and she volunteers at her kids &apos; school .
private school ?
no , public .
she lives frugally , quietly .
there were no complaints from neighbors , staff , or coworkers .
so she &apos;s a saint ?
for chicago or the world ?
there are no saints .
the smaller the sin , the larger you have to make the magnifying glass .
there .
that &apos;s her husband .
yeah , he &apos;s white , we know .
this is not the south .
with some issues , everywhere &apos;s the south .
i &apos;ll think about it .
she &apos;s good . no paper trail .
keeps her distance from the machine .
no money i could find .
nothing to get a foothold .
hmm . my staff wants me to go after the miscegenation vote .
her white husband .
oh , yeah .
in some neighborhoods , that works .
i could work up some flyers .
what else ?
i &apos;m looking into some clinic visits .
there might be an abortion .
what ? did she film it ?
no . we &apos;re still checking it out .
i am in a meeting .
you &apos;re not gonna like this .
i was tracking a &quot; q and a &quot; that wendy did up at albany park .
you know , getting some shots of people waiting ,
trying to put together an idiot supporter montage .
whoo ! wendy !
so what do you guys like about her ?
she just makes a lot of sense .
you know , it @-@ it &apos;s different .
with obama now , politics is cool again .
no . no , no , no .
what &apos;s the case ?
no case .
it &apos;s the folder i stole from your car .
ah . yeah .
after you trashed it .
so you , uh ... you finding a lot in there ?
some .
you take a lot of notes .
hey , do you know , uh , what i @-@ legal is ?
it &apos;s the illinois lesbian &amp; gay law association .
they just rated chicago law firms on their diversity
in hiring gays and lesbians , and transgenders and ... whatever .
anyway , lockhart / gardner &amp; bond did not do well ,
even though i know for a fact that we have gay associates
who just aren &apos;t acknowledging that they &apos;re gay .
now , in this day and age ,
why would someone not be up @-@ front about their sexual orientation ?
are you coming out ?
you know the theory that i work under ?
no .
it &apos;s better not to keep secrets
&apos;cause then people don &apos;t go looking .
all right .
hello .
hi . it &apos;s me .
yeah .
uh , we need to talk .
no , i agree that &apos;s fantastic .
okay .
mrg pharmaceuticals just fired their team this weekend .
alicia !
what , their jury consultants ?
their everything .
our opponents just fired their lawyers ;
they &apos;re going with a firm from new york .
they &apos;re scrambling .
who did they get ?
we don &apos;t know yet ; we &apos;re trying to find out .
it &apos;s probably bernstein , meyers .
they won that asbestos suit last year .
bring them on . they &apos;ll look like an army against us .
we &apos;ll have three women at the plaintiff &apos;s table ;
they &apos;ll have a half @-@ dozen out @-@ of @-@ towners .
it &apos;ll be david and goliath writ large ,
so i want you to handle voir dire .
me ?
yes . are you ready ?
i am . yes .
um , diane , as your jury consultant ...
don &apos;t worry , if they &apos;re bringing in new york ,
we need to play up our recognizability in chicago .
the new yorkers will object , but let them .
they &apos;ll look like killjoys .
diane , um ... i just need a minute .
and a cup of coffee .
okay . don &apos;t be late .
you &apos;ll be good .
$ 30 to 40 million--
this could turn everything around for the firm .
not to put too much pressure on you .
can i have a regular coffee , please .
thank you .
oh , thank you .
doors are heavy .
yeah .
what ?
oh . my bus pass .
i must have dropped it .
i keep my id with it .
i must have dropped it by the coffee cart .
would you mind ?
yeah . sure .
by the coffee cart ?
yeah , i think ... i mean , i was by the bench for a minute ,
but i think it &apos;s by the coffee cart .
thank you so much .
what are we waiting on , ms. lockhart ?
uh , my co @-@ counsel is just outside , your honor .
she is handling voir dire
and she should be here any moment .
is the defense ready for voir dire ?
certainly , your honor .
then let &apos;s go .
mr. canning .
good morning .
first of all , i want to thank you for your service .
and i probably need to explain a few things .
what were you doing ?
i &apos;m sorry . there was a ...
good morning , mrs. florrick .
i hope you don &apos;t mind we , uh , started without you .
now , uh , before i ask you just a few questions ,
i- i think i probably owe you an explanation .
i suffer from a condition , tardive dyskinesia .
which is really , it &apos;s just a funny word
for a neurological disorder .
and it makes me do this ...
and ... this . and ...
but , uh ...
if you just look at me long enough , you get used to it .
so , um ... you know , feel free to look , and i @-@ i won &apos;t mind .
now the good news is ... these pills .
i- i , um , take these every few hours ,
and- and they don &apos;t make the symptoms disappear completely ,
but they do diminish ...
objection .
approach the bench .
your honor , defense counsel is using voir dire to argue his case .
you &apos;ll have to explain that to me .
this whole case hinges on a drug--
whether in fact an antidepressant drug your client manufactured
made people want to kill themselves .
your honor , i &apos;m simply trying to make sure
that my symptoms won &apos;t be a distraction .
part of my voir dire is to discover who will have problems
with my condition , and who will not .
makes sense to me , mrs. florrick .
overruled .
as i was saying , i don &apos;t want my symptoms to be a distraction ,
but i have to tell you that they do intensify
when i become perplexed ,
and i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m just , i &apos;m really transparent that way .
so , for example , i don &apos;t want you to be distracted
when my opponents are questioning ...
objection .
so , are we going to have a trial at some point ?
your honor , mr. canning is trying , yet again , to taint this jury .
how ? i was helping you this time .
i just don &apos;t want my movements to be a distraction .
no , sir , you were guaranteeing that the jury
will be watching you throughout our testimony to see how you react .
my god , the cynicism here is breathtaking .
have you thought maybe you might have a problem with disabled people ?
your honor !
all right , all right . mr. canning ,
let &apos;s try to keep the pained outrage to a minimum here .
i &apos;m sorry , your honor . it &apos;s just a sore point with me .
mrs. florrick , i understand your point ,
but i think mr. canning needs to inoculate the jury to his ...
what is the proper word ?
condition .
condition .
so again , overruled .
did you have any luck finding my bus pass ?
&apos;cause my driver might need it if the limo won &apos;t start .
okay , we just turned into goliath .
hey , johnny , you got a fast one ?
i need to get out of here by 3 : 00 .
thanks . oh , yeah . of course it &apos;s the dog .
as usual ...
hey , donna .
what &apos;s up ?
you &apos;re talking to somebody .
i &apos;m talking to somebody ?
i &apos;m talking to a lot of people .
somebody from my office .
an investigator named blake ?
&quot; indecent exposure . public masturbation . &quot;
look . i need you to stop talking .
kalinda . four months ,
and this is what you come to talk to me about ?
how are you ?
oh , yeah .
humanitarian of the year .
mr. bay . are any of you mr. bay ?
mr. bay ? i &apos;m donna .
i &apos;m from the public defender &apos;s office .
i &apos;m here to defend you on charges of indecency ,
masturbating in a public park .
do you understand what i &apos;m saying to you ?
are you masturbating right now ?
don &apos;t do that .
get your hands out of your pockets , don &apos;t say a word .
who do you have for us today , ms. seabrook ?
an innocent man , your honor .
i &apos;m sure .
mr. raymond bay , an upstanding citizen ,
who was arrested in berger park with his hands in his pockets ,
supposedly making , as the arrest report states ,
&quot; the motions of masturbation . &quot;
but as we all know , the weather
along the shore last night was unseasonably cold .
mr. bay was doing nothing more than what any of us would do ,
which was warming his shivering ,
and therefore , shaking hands in his pockets .
let this one go , counselor .
time served .
next !
you &apos;re welcome .
you could make a lot of money at a big firm .
why ? when i meet so many interesting people here .
everything &apos;s fine .
i didn &apos;t talk to anybody .
i didn &apos;t tell anybody your secrets .
and if this guy approaches me ...
blake .
i won &apos;t tell him how heartless you can be ,
how insensitive ,
how self @-@ preservation is your number one concern ,
and after four months ,
you can barely say hello .
i won &apos;t tell him any of that , okay ?
my sense is , we got the jury we wanted ,
but the ...
handicap of the opposing counsel has undercut
my earlier assumptions .
meaning ?
he &apos;s co @-@ opted our jury .
i don &apos;t get it .
he &apos;s ... handicapped ?
and he &apos;s using it .
he &apos;s making the pharmaceutical company look like the good guy .
but the medical testimony will prove otherwise .
we still have a slam @-@ dunk here .
yeah , we &apos;re acting like we &apos;re the ones on the run here .
talk to the doctors ,
get them ready for some tough cross .
i &apos;m trying to figure out ...
how to broach this one .
okay .
why don &apos;t you give me a subject line ?
grace , your daughter .
she attended a wendy scott @-@ carr speech ,
and spoke out for her .
we have it on tape .
but not for public consumption .
one of our trackers caught it .
one of our trackers ?
yes . i have to keeps tabs .
well , what did she say ?
oh , wendy &apos;s makes so much sense .
how there &apos;s so much corruption here .
i think she meant chicago .
how much she likes her . i &apos;m paraphrasing , but succinctly .
okay , i will talk to her .
thank you .
and i &apos;m sorry to have to bring this to you .
i promise , next time , i &apos;ll bring something good .
elvatyl is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor .
and this is the antidepressant drug manufactured by the defendant ?
yes .
it controls depression by stopping the brain
from reabsorbing serotonin .
i see . now , let me ask you this .
in your latest clinical trial ,
you found that people taking elvatyl were three times as likely ...
sorry .
they were three times as likely to commit suicide
as those taking sugar pills .
is that correct ?
yes , it is .
uh , it appears that the serotonin transporter gene 5 @-@ htt
increases the synaptic serotonin levels .
and how would you describe that in layman &apos;s term ?
in layman &apos;s terms ?
well , as a threshold matter ,
the mechanism for ssri inhibition
is poorly understood .
think of it as a train switchyard ,
and the ssri is the conductor ,
with the track the absorption rate ,
and the 5 @-@ htt gene as the coal .
thank you . no further questions .
mr. canning .
thank you .
doctor ...
talk to me about sex .
about sex ?
yeah .
this stuff you &apos;re talking about-- this , uh , ssrl ...
ssri .
&quot; i. &quot;
um , how does it affect a person &apos;s sex life ?
well , i &apos;m not sure i understand the question .
well , if ... for example , if there were feelings of jealousy ,
this drug would intensify them , correct ?
yes , i suppose so .
but it couldn &apos;t create jealousy out of nowhere .
i mean , there would have to be a reason
for such jealousy to exist .
objection . beyond the scope .
sustained .
guess we can dodge that question for the moment .
all right , doctor .
getting back to ssrl &apos;s effect on a person &apos;s sex life ...
get lost .
so what is it ?
the abortion ?
no .
but i know why she was going to the doctor .
breast augmentation .
you &apos;re kidding me .
no .
four visits over two months .
so mother teresa got breast implants .
does that humanize her or not ?
i would say not .
i would say you &apos;re right .
she cares about the poor , and yet ...
how much did she spend ?
over two months ...
$ 19,000 .
it &apos;s clinton &apos;s haircut .
no , it &apos;s better than clinton &apos;s haircut .
and yet ...
what ?
the candidate .
he won &apos;t go there .
since when did you care where the candidate wanted to go ?
give me that .
what do you want , eli ?
you can just go to hell .
uh @-@ huh . and what have i done now ?
that was ours . go find your own .
eli , you &apos;re blathering .
i &apos;m just warning you-- stay the hell away !
okay , i &apos;m going now .
what does that do ?
he &apos;s a childs plant .
mm @-@ hmm . i &apos;ve known for a week .
just waiting for a chance to use .
so , go have him make a xerox .
that &apos;s what i like about you , eli .
sorry .
um , my mom was great .
and there was this change that came over her
after she started taking it .
elvatyl ?
yeah . the doctor prescribed it .
i was going away to college , and my mom ...
you know , empty nest syndrome .
could you describe the change ?
within a day , she became more depressed .
she couldn &apos;t sleep .
she had nightmares that made her scream .
it was horrible .
hello .
your stepdad had just started a new job . is that right ?
yes . um , at thurrell interiors .
he designed furniture ?
yes . couches and fold @-@ out beds .
and he worked in a department with all women ?
yeah . why ?
oh , no reason . i just ...
i want to be clear on the facts . that &apos;s all .
11 employees-- all women--
and your stepdad .
yes . he liked his job .
he spend some late nights there , did he ?
at his work ? i guess .
they were trying to get out the spring catalogue .
well , what i &apos;m saying is , actually ...
this is a list of items the police vouchered
when they arrived at your mom &apos;s house .
i want you to do me a favor .
i want you to read for me item number seven .
&quot; a gym bag &quot;
&quot; a bloody gym bag , &quot; it says .
and that was your stepdad &apos;s .
uh , could ... could you read for me item seven @-@ b ?
&quot; women &apos;s panties , black . &quot;
ah , that &apos;s good .
and @-@ and what does it say in the parentheses here ?
&quot; small . &quot;
&quot; small . &quot; that &apos;s good .
well , let me take that .
caitlin , what size was your mom ?
what size ?
you mean , like , clothing ?
yeah .
i guess ... a 12 ?
12 ... 12 would be large ,
not ... not the size of these panties .
it &apos;s all right .
you don &apos;t have to answer .
i - i do have to ask you this question , though .
is it true that your mom and your stepdad
argued over a woman at work ?
no .
a woman he was in love with ?
objection . no foundation .
sustained .
who was much younger and prettier than your mom ?
objection .
mr. canning , that &apos;s enough .
my apologies , your honor .
i have no further questions .
and , uh , i &apos;m sorry for your loss .
we need to regroup .
so how are we doing today ?
your office is ... small .
yes . small , but pure .
so , in the third year , do you get a window ?
should i shut the door ?
no . no , it &apos;s bad enough they think
i &apos;m going to flip back to the defense .
so what &apos;s up ? what do you need ?
why do you think i need anything ?
because you &apos;re kalinda .
my , uh ... my usual sources have dried up here ,
and ... sorry .
i thought maybe you could help .
it &apos;s a personal matter .
it &apos;s a new investigator from baltimore--
blake calamar .
blake calamar .
yeah .
all right .
and what do i get in return ?
well , what do you want ?
who was she ?
the woman who ran out of court ?
an intern at canning &apos;s firm .
damn , if we could undercut canning by subpoenaing her ...
that &apos;s playing on his battlefield .
we need to pull him onto ours .
ours is the medicine .
the problem with the medicine is it &apos;s boring .
but it &apos;s still the truth .
and the truth is boring .
he &apos;s got soap opera , and we &apos;ve got genetic science .
that &apos;s always been our case .
no , that &apos;s our facts .
our case is what we do with those facts .
and right now , our case is failing caitlin .
we need to make medicine sexy .
yep .
a lie always beats the truth .
can adapt ; it doesn &apos;t have to be consistent .
so we need to give the truth the drama of a lie .
increased libido .
one of the side effects of elvatyl
is it has a potential increased libido in women .
good .
we need to meet our last expert witness .
who is it ?
i &apos;m sorry , you want me to say what ?
one of the side effects you noticed
was an increased desire for sex in public places .
th ... that &apos;s ludicrous .
it &apos;s in your study , doctor .
no , it isn &apos;t .
subject 18--
she mentioned it in her trial interview .
she was merely mentioning that as an aside .
our trial interviewer quickly brought her back to point .
yes , that was unfortunate .
we also want you to discuss the increased desire
for oral and anal intercourse
mentioned by subject 35 .
ms. lockhart , this is ...
it &apos;s what we need , doctor .
it &apos;s what caitlin needs to win .
well , i &apos;m not a clown .
i &apos;m not a performing circus animal .
i &apos;m a man of science .
suit yourself , dr. lawton .
but you &apos;ve only fulfilled half your contract ,
and we &apos;ll be stopping payment
as soon as you board that elevator .
thank you , doctor .
did you happen to videotape any of your animal trials ?
your most violent ones ?
i just wanted to hear her speak .
that &apos;s all .
and i want you to hear her speak ,
but you did more than that .
you spoke to someone .
how do you know ?
someone videotaped you .
who ?
are you angry at dad ?
no .
somebody asked me a question , and i answered them .
it &apos;s a free country .
yes , thank you , grace .
you know this will hurt dad .
mom , she &apos;s really good . she really is .
yes , and if you were her daughter , you could talk about that .
so i just can &apos;t say what i think ?
you can say what you think here at home .
but just not to other people .
when you &apos;re 18 .
i know you think i &apos;m being unfair .
but when you &apos;re older ,
and you do something i disagree with ,
i won &apos;t tell it to other people .
i will tell it to you first .
mom , it &apos;s politics . it &apos;s different .
no , this is family ; it &apos;s not different .
then , so , if i disagree with something dad did ,
i should just tell him ?
what do you disagree with ?
* wendy scott @-@ carr went to town *
* just to buy a boob job *
* stuck some tissues in her bra *
* and called it ... *
* a personal matter , completely irrelevant to my job . *
* wendy scott @-@ carr &apos;s double @-@ d ... *
* wendy is fantastic *
* wendy cares for all the poor *
* but wendy now is plastic *
where did you find this ?
online .
so it could be anyone .
it could be the other campaign .
is it ?
that is why the 5 @-@ hydroxytryptamine gene
is a monoamine neurotransmitter .
uh , thank you .
now , in your clinical trials ,
what did you find unusual about this surplus of tryptophan ?
well , oddly , in some subjects , it made them desire anal sex .
anal sex ? really ?
was that surprising ?
yes .
and also , in one subject ,
it caused an increased interest in exhibitionist sex .
objection , your honor . relevance .
the defendant &apos;s case is built on the premise that
mrs. fenton was jealous of her husband because he was having an affair .
we intend to show that elvatyl
in fact encouraged sexual activity ,
which could lead the jury to deduce
that the fentons &apos; sexual relationship was healthy ...
we &apos;ll stipulate that elvatyl causes increased libido , your honor .
thank you , we &apos;d like to argue our own case .
overruled .
so , uh , doctor ,
by exhibitionist sex , you mean
sex in public places , like gas stations and shopping malls ?
oh , yes .
and in one instance , a public park .
really ?
and this was after injecting
white rats with minimal doses of elvatyl ?
yes , we wanted to see the impact of
the 5 @-@ ht2c receptors on dopamine @-@ producing cells .
you sure you couldn &apos;t find any place darker ?
you want to go ?
what ?
you want to go ? !
no .
i just want to make sure you feel anonymous enough .
you broke my heart .
not intentionally .
well , that &apos;s a relief .
donna , i &apos;m not ...
i &apos;m not domestic .
you think that &apos;s what i wanted ?
yeah , i do .
you &apos;re just trying to keep me in line .
what do you mean ?
you phone me so i won &apos;t talk to your guy , blake .
can &apos;t i be multitasking ?
i can &apos;t do this again .
hurts too much .
then don &apos;t think about it .
look , it &apos;s just now , and we &apos;re just here .
and tomorrow we &apos;ll be someplace else .
and that &apos;s tomorrow .
i don &apos;t work that way .
all right , that @-@ that &apos;s enough .
mr. canning , this is a very late addition to the witness list .
yes , your honor , that &apos;s true .
but , as you know , i myself was a late addition to this case ,
and , given my condition , i can be ...
oh , come on .
oh , that &apos;s right . mrs. florrick gets offended when i bring that up .
i only talked to this therapist last night , your honor .
this isn &apos;t just any therapist , your honor .
this is the late mrs. fenton &apos;s therapist ,
and , as such , any conversations they had are subject
to patient / therapist confidentiality .
but mrs. fenton is dead .
that doesn &apos;t matter .
the right remains intact after death .
in illinois , yes , but not in wisconsin .
dr. booth moved his practice to wisconsin in 2009 ;
he continued to counsel mrs. fenton
both telephonically and in person .
this is outrageous .
you can &apos;t decide things differently based on geography .
uh , actually , you can , counselor .
the therapist &apos;s notes and testimony regarding any post @-@ 2009 sessions
will be allowed .
anything before that is disallowed .
so you were seeing mrs. fenton a week before
she shot herself and her husband ?
yes , i &apos;m very sorry to say .
she was a very lovely woman .
i &apos;m so very sorry , caitlin .
and what did she discuss with you at that time , dr. booth ?
well , uh , many , many things , of course .
but , uh , she was very jealous
in the last month of her too short life .
jealous ?
of her husband ?
yes .
she thought he was sleeping with somebody .
did she say who she suspected him of sleeping with ?
she thought he was sleeping with her daughter .
that &apos;d be the plaintiff ,
caitlin fenton ?
yes . but of course , this was just her suspicion .
that doesn &apos;t mean there was actually any reason to suspect .
of course .
but did she give a reason for her suspicion ?
well , again , i would very much like to caution here :
this is merely what she said .
but she found underwear
among her husband &apos;s effects .
and did she say who the underwear belonged to ?
yes . her daughter .
i am so sorry . i am so sorry .
so it &apos;s true , what the therapist said ?
no . i mean ,
my stepdad was ...
i am so sorry .
he came into my room and he took my underwear . once .
it wasn &apos;t a big deal ,
but i told him to stop .
he said he would .
he pleaded with me not to tell my mom .
i am so sorry .
so there were no sexual relations ?
no .
my mom came in , and she accused me of tempting him .
this is after she started taking the pills .
and that &apos;s why i was moving out .
i didn &apos;t want to be the test case .
i really didn &apos;t want to be .
don &apos;t worry ,
we &apos;ll make this work .
what are you doing now ?
anything you want , mr. gardner .
i need something on a dr. randall booth ,
a therapist in wisconsin .
anything specific ?
everything specific .
we need to kneecap him .
whatever you can find .
whatever we can use in court .
okay , i &apos;m on it .
kalinda has been snooping around about me .
don &apos;t worry about it .
if you say so .
* wendy scott @-@ carr &apos;s double @-@ d ... *
* wendy is fantastic *
you know , it is pretty catchy .
* wendy cares for all the poor *
* but wendy now is plastic *
so no one is taking credit for this video yet ,
but how are you dealing with all of it ?
well , it &apos;s difficult ,
but i think that &apos;s just modern politics .
is there perhaps , though , a good point to be made here ?
i mean , you have shot up in the polls .
and you &apos;ve done it as this friend of the downtrodden .
and yet , here we see you getting cosmetic surgery .
were you concerned about your looks ?
no .
about a year ago , i was diagnosed with stage @-@ 2 breast cancer .
not even my best friends knew about it .
and , um , i had to undergo a double mastectomy .
i &apos;m well now .
i know there was the option to live without reconstruction ...
anybody linking to the wendy cartoon , stop now !
stop !
i &apos;m sorry for taking so long to respond to these allegations ,
but it really is a personal matter .
and i just wish we would return to the issues .
so what have you got ?
oh , kalinda , there you are .
you &apos;re working late .
yeah , just trying to get a drug dealer off the streets .
someone i &apos;m sure lockhart / gardner
will be representing tomorrow .
yep . i can feel the moral gravity pulling me in .
so , you called ?
blake calamar .
yeah ?
it &apos;s an interesting read .
do you want to share ?
in baltimore he was working two jobs ,
but i guess you &apos;d identify there .
the only problem was his second job--
it was protecting ms @-@ 13 .
yep .
when he wasn &apos;t protecting bond &amp; associate interests ,
he was out protecting baltimore &apos;s biggest meth gang .
how do you know that ?
he was arrested , never charged .
bond got him off .
oh , no .
that &apos;s official state &apos;s attorney business .
got a lovely little viper nest going on over there .
if i were you , i &apos;d be careful .
thanks .
all i can say is my involvement with this wendy cartoon
has become a distraction from the real issues in this campaign .
a toast to a fallen comrade .
... childs had nothing to do ...
it could have been us .
he had no knowledge of my involvement .
not a bad day &apos;s work , huh ?
come on , eli .
it &apos;s just you and me here .
you pointed the press toward him .
i was asked a simple question by a reporter
and i chose to answer it honestly .
and so i apologize to wendy scott @-@ carr
and to glenn childs .
effective today , i tender my resignation from his campaign .
thank you .
this announcement from patrick sturges is the latest ...
hey , dad .
dad ?
and you were a patient of dr. randall booth &apos;s
before he moved to wisconsin ?
yes .
your honor , we must object again .
and we must overrule again , mr. canning .
now , do you know the reason why dr. booth moved to wisconsin ?
the reason ?
well , i guess it was me .
you ?
can you explain ?
well , dr. booth , he ...
i was his patient and he slept with me .
i threatened to bring charges
so he ... well , he decided to move .
who found her ?
the witness her ?
yeah .
blake did .
and do you have an opinion about dr. booth &apos;s veracity ?
objection , your honor .
sustained .
nothing further , your honor .
your honor ,
it would be our preference to recall dr. randall booth to the stand ,
however it &apos;s come to our attention
that he &apos;s been hospitalized after a burglary attempt at his office .
we ask for a continuance
until we can recall this essential witness .
denied . is there anything else , mr. canning ?
we ask for a five minute recess
so we can discuss a settlement with plaintiff &apos;s counsel .
granted . we &apos;re in recess until 4 : 10 p.m.
so he said , &quot; what do we need to end this right now ? &quot;
i love it when they say &quot; we . &quot;
this is during the five minute recess ?
yeah , the clock was ticking .
so i said very simply ,
as though it were the most natural thing in the world ,
&quot; you want to settle the whole class action ? $ 40 million . &quot;
i thought he was going to come back at ten .
he comes in at 30 .
little did he know we &apos;d take 20 .
so we settle at 35 !
$ 35 million .
of which we get to keep $ 7 million .
we buy another floor of offices .
two floors , with a gym .
why do i seem happier than you ?
because you won .
the firm is solvent .
you make it sound so end @-@ of @-@ the @-@ year boring .
this is big .
it is .
so smile .
no , kalinda , a genuine smile .
look , there &apos;s blake .
oh , i get it .
it &apos;s because he found the witness and you didn &apos;t .
yeah , that &apos;s it .
hey , look , blake &apos;s got a date .
i &apos;ve got to see what kind of woman dates blake . come on .
hi , blake .
hey .
hey .
hi .
oh , that &apos;s right , i think you two know each other .
oh , no , i don &apos;t think we do . i &apos;m alicia .
no , he means me . hi , donna .
kalinda . i was just heading home from work when blake dropped by
and asked if i wanted to come .
so you work with kalinda ?
i do . and how do you two know each other ?
um , from the state attorney &apos;s office .

i didn &apos;t even make the connection .
look , i &apos;m taking you home .
no , you &apos;re not .

and i &apos;m not connected to you .
thanks .
mr. canning .
mrs. florrick .
are you looking for diane ?
i am . we have a few details to work out .
you fought well , sir .
yes , yes , i did .
better luck next time .
why are we laughing ?
well , because we &apos;re funny .
mrs. florrick , you think you were my equal in that courtroom ,
but you were new math ,
i was , uh , advanced trigonometry .
well , too bad trigonometry lost .
i didn &apos;t lose .
lockhart / gardner stumbled their way into a $ 90 million class action .
mrg pharmaceuticals asked me to lower you down to $ 50 million .
i landed you at 35 .
i &apos;m going home with a bonus of $ 1.3 million and stock options .
that &apos;s not losing .
but , hey , it &apos;s been fun ,
and maybe i &apos;ll see you again sometime .
we can mix it up in court .
