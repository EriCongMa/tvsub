closer than you think .
homer-- can i call you homer ?

who just sit and hold hands .

we &apos;re gonna be checking out
a delightful hong kong horror remake
known as crawlspace ,
based on paxing kongjian .
well , count me out , jimbo .
i don &apos;t need to hear how every chick in the movie
got what was coming to them .
shauna , food for thought :
if we don &apos;t watch movies about torture in crawl spaces ,
how will we know what to do
if someone puts us in a torture crawl space ?
not if , when .
nah , i &apos;m gonna go see one of those jennifer aniston movies
where she rolls her eyes on the poster .
错误借口
babe , you know i don &apos;t want you watching a movie by yourself .
you &apos;re a total perv magnet .

someone unthreatening .

now , you stay close to my shauna .
if someone so much as peels a ladybug decal
off her fake fingernails , i &apos;m blaming you !
come on , come on .
the best murder &apos;s always first .
not my eyelids !
are you telling me
the real reason you started dating me
was so you could buy my flower shop ?
yes . your lease was the last thing stopping me
from tearing this place down
and building the biggest horse crematorium in manhattan .
but none of that matters now .
all right , we &apos;ve seen his ass .
let &apos;s go .
hey , i can hook you up
with pinto and black beans .
oh , i &apos;ll do anything for free beans .

corn , flour , corn , corn ,
no gluten , corn .
two stuck together ? !
oh , now i got to fill out a form !
listen , lady , you do not two @-@ time the man
with the skull t @-@ shirt .
jimbo doesn &apos;t care about me .
he didn &apos;t even notice my side braid .
oh , that is cool .
looks like two snakes trying to kill each other on your head .
that &apos;s what i was going for .
you know , for a second grader , you &apos;re pretty sharp .
i &apos;m actually in fourth grade ,
but i read at a second grade level .
they think i might have a problem .
why did i see that movie
the day before i have to clean the crawl space ?
come on , boy ! we &apos;ve got to go home !
i saved big bucks on the delivery charges .
i got to go .
he &apos;s my ride .
not so fast , simpson .
fyi , you got another date tomorrow with shauna .
why can &apos;t you do it ?
we &apos;re going to a seminar :
&quot; extracting lunch money from a cashless society . &quot;
we &apos;re gonna rob the guy giving the seminar .
bart and i &apos;ll figure out something .
doesn &apos;t get any better than this .
that &apos;s weird , my armpits are getting wet !
wow , the tv &apos;s hooked up to the internet .
you can stream whole seasons of old tv shows .
seen it . seen it . seen it .
british version was better .
totally scripted . sued it .
stranded ? what &apos;s that ?
stranded was a show about people marooned on a mysterious island
that &apos;s riddled with religious and scientific paradoxes .
it was huge .
well , the first season and the last season .
well , islands are always entertaining ,
from gilligan to iwo jima .
a plane crash !
wait a minute .
that flashback raised more questions than it answered .
oh , my god .
inside the coconut ,
my pet cat from when i was little .
and on his name tag
is the number of our flight !
purr @-@ gatory .
where are we ? !
what a great opening episode !
and i &apos;m sure everything they said will pay off handsomely !
let &apos;s go . and don &apos;t look guilty .
young lady , i need to check your purse .
i didn &apos;t steal nothing .
if anything happens to her ,
i &apos;ll beat you up from inside your brain .
i stole this .
you stole perfume ?
uh , yeah , me .
i use it all the time .
mi @-@ mi @-@ mi @-@ mi @-@ mi
you @-@ you @-@ you @-@ you
and i are taking a trip to mall jail .
isn &apos;t that what used to be the beanie baby store ?
shut up .
this is so cool .
you took a fall for me .
no one &apos;s done anything for me before .
don &apos;t worry . i made sure he can &apos;t get too far .
i &apos;d use my legs but i &apos;ve forgotten how !
come with me .
hey , the first time we lost maggie was in this store !
bart , here &apos;s my thank @-@ you gift .
what could a girl have that i ...
oh , my god !
it &apos;s just like dad &apos;s !
bart , you haven &apos;t touched your mashed potatoes .
more breast ?
what-- no !
i &apos;m offering you a chicken breast , you boob !
doesn &apos;t anyone here realize i &apos;m only ten years old ?
bart , no dinner means no dessert .
i &apos;m just not ready for cookies !
you know , i should get back to the treadmill .
he exercises so much , but he looks the same .
i guess the weight will all come off at once ,
some day in the future .
don &apos;t you believe anything homer says .
his first word was a lie .
who did this ?
mommy .
she did ? !
then i &apos;m gonna withhold affection
without telling her why .
don &apos;t believe anything you were told by me in the past ,
because that was not me .
but this is me now .
but in less than a second , i &apos;ll be gone forever .
i might be back !
the lava being !
homer !
you &apos;re using your expensive new treadmill
just to watch a show that went off the air five years ago ?
and when i wanted to watch it with you then ,
you said it was pretentious and repetitive .
marge , there &apos;re so many mysteries i need to have solved .
now , if the korean couple can &apos;t speak english ,
why were they doing a crossword puzzle
where the answer to 23 down was &quot; enigma &quot; spelled backwards ?
what does it mean ?
it means use the treadmill for running or take it back !
and where will i watch tv ?
on the tv !
and where will i walk ? !
on the ground !
and where ...
this is the stupidest fight ever !
we &apos;ve had stupider !
i don &apos;t think so .
hey , fart @-@ tholomew .
you did a sweet job watching my woman yesterday .
so , what do you want to do now ?
what any boy would :
push you in a puddle and run away .
maybe i should be faithful to jimbo .
he &apos;s bought me a lot of gum over the past couple months .
listen ...
i could get wedgied for this , but jimbo &apos;s a jerk .
you can do better .
wow . you told me what &apos;s best for me ...
at risk to yourself .
come with me .
shauna , i forgot to grope you goodbye .
at last ! this episode promises to finally answer one question .
homie !
the kids are away and maggie &apos;s napping ...
ooh , that &apos;s great .
can it wait another 104 hours ?
she walked away
and slammed the door . what does it mean ?
what does it mean ? !
it means i &apos;m mad !
oh , that &apos;s such a first @-@ take answer !
this one &apos;s yours , ralphie .
simpson , i guess you don &apos;t have much respect for me .
well , who wears a wool hat to a pool ?
it &apos;s not fair !
you know that &apos;s hilarious !
no horseplay in the pool area .
this isn &apos;t play ; this is some serious payback .
well , that &apos;s , um ...
all right , you may have found a loophole .
all right , i better check .
hello , abby ?
i &apos;m not calling about the shift change ! god !
but , well , since you bring it up ,
if there &apos;s a way to flip saturday with next wednesday ...
simpson , prepare to ...
hey , no running on the deck !
i &apos;m on the grass apron !
huh ? ugh , everyone &apos;s a swimming pool lawyer .
oh thank god , mom will pound them .
why if it isn &apos;t jimbo , dorf and ernie .
bart &apos;s not home yet .
but i &apos;m always looking to encourage non @-@ milhouse play dates .
stick around .
hey bart !
oh , it &apos;s you .
why do men always think with their tongue ?
i came to help you .
then go back to jimbo , and show him every boob you &apos;ve got .
but you told me he was a jerk , and i that i could do better .
all right .
follow me to a place where nerds ,
dorks and dweebs can gather in safety .
this isn &apos;t , like , some creepy place under an off @-@ ramp ?
okay , we &apos;ll go to my second choice .
now you be careful with bart &apos;s undies .
we will , mrs. simpson .
think of this as your personal asgard ,
and i , the all @-@ seeing heimdall , guardian of the gate .
all @-@ seeing ?
yeah , when &apos;s the last time you saw your feet ?
oh , that &apos;s it !
fellow bullies , i &apos;ve got them !
we &apos;ll be right there .
you &apos;re a bully ?
a cyber bully .
anything i do , it is important that
i can lie down while doing it .
you just got yourself in a flame war ... with a teenage girl .
oh , flame on !
you have cloven me from my ponytail to my slipper shoe !
get out !
and never return !
oh , unless you want to buy old archie comics .
20 pound bricks are a dollar .
thank you all for coming to my stranded discussion group .
hey , i loved that show .
wasn &apos;t it awesome when colonel darkwater ...
spoiler alert !
i &apos;ve only seen up to season three ,
episode 17 : &quot; coconut cream die . &quot;
so you don &apos;t know that season five was a complete wank ?
spoiler !
homer , calm down .
it &apos;s not like any of this stuff really took place .
spoiler !
homer , for god sakes ,
i &apos;m trying to put maggie to sleep .
i &apos;m sorry , sweetie .
it &apos;s a strandie discussion group .
yes , it is !
we discuss why airplane go crash @-@ crash
but people don &apos;t die @-@ die .
you wanna know what happens on your stupid show ?
firstly , the &quot; mysterious island &quot;
is 15 miles from long beach .
also , doorway three led to hell
despite the series creators &apos; repeated insistence
it did not lead to hell ,
and the entire strandiverse ,
is a piece of gravel in a cosmic kitty litter box !
thanks , marge .
you ruined my show .
now , i &apos;m going to give you a spoiler
about our marriage : it &apos;s not great right now .
well , since this is a discussion group ,
let &apos;s discuss .
i think they &apos;re having a spat .
i &apos;d say it &apos;s more of a tiff .
oh , so i &apos;m a moron , am i ?
fellas , fellas , i know where this is going .
give me all your weapons now .
now it &apos;s time to talk about what carl wants .
oh , man , they have every entrance covered .
you &apos;d have to be a navy seal to get in or out .
hello , lovebirds .
what are you doing here ?
i &apos;ve been following your storyline from afar , bart ,
waiting for that inevitable point
where you get into trouble you couldn &apos;t get out of .
perhaps i could broker a settlement .
well , that &apos;s my boyfriend , but he &apos;s a wad .
and your brother &apos;s not a wad , he &apos;s a dink
on the road to doofus .
here , here .
the lamb has returned to the slaughter .
whoa , you should write that down , man .
i &apos;ll remember it .
i don &apos;t think shauna should choose any of you .
shauna should choose shauna .
your older sister &apos;s right , bart.
you don &apos;t want me ?
i want to find out who i am .
and that &apos;s something only
an inappropriately older man can tell me .
well , that is one lucky creepy guy .
lisa , are you out there in your slippers ?
come inside !
well , bart , i guess that &apos;s our cue to skedaddle ...
not so fast , simpson ...
uh , what was that thing i was gonna do to him ?
told you you should &apos;ve written it down .
if i wrote down everything you told me to write down ,
i &apos;d have no time for punching .
whoa , you should write that down , man .
lousy marge ...
ruining the delicate relationship
between a man and his tv show .
i &apos;d tell my best friend , but that &apos;s marge too .
homie , come in the bedroom .
care to join me in a private last episode party ?
well ...
it &apos;s okay , dad .
he &apos;s just putting the fear of god in me .
okay , but if this house starts a @-@ rockin &apos; ,
don &apos;t come a @-@ knockin &apos; .
have a wonderful evening , sir .
