dammit !
come on . oh , elroy !
elroy , hey .
computer no worky .
please don &apos;t do that .
computer no worky .
did you forget your password again ?
pelton , i can &apos;t keep track
of all the parakeets you had growing up .
this is different .
no matter what i do , i get the same error .
which one ?
you have been owned by elite fleet 69 .
our hacks are all up in your systems .
i &apos;m not bothering to pronounce them ,
but there are a lot of z &apos;s being used .
oh , crap .
what ?
is there another mask movie coming out ?
the school &apos;s been hacked .
what ?
how can we stop it ?
it &apos;s too late , it &apos;s happened .
no parlo hablo too late at greendale elroy .
there &apos;s always something that can be done .
you know i , i wasn &apos;t gonna say anything but .
you could cut the hardline at the mainframe .
hardline .
mainframe .
to the mainframe !
to the mainframe !
cut the hardline .
you were being sarcastic ?
yeah , but you should look at this .
cancel your offensive performance .
you know the one we mean .
we have all your information .
if you do not cancel this hateful comedy show ,
you will taste our power in this way .
there &apos;s a link .
don &apos;t click it .
oh , what , the green skull will give me a virus ?
my god .
it &apos;s the lunch lady &apos;s emails .
it &apos;s all the lunch lady &apos;s emails .
which lunch lady ?
the hot one ?
you mean the one who serves the hot food ?
mmm , that &apos;s the one .
第六季 第六集
please tell me you guys
aren &apos;t sitting there reading the lunch lady &apos;s leaked e @-@ mails .
no one here could ever do that ,
not even in shifts , it &apos;s decades of data .
i &apos;m reading the greendale
gazette &apos;s highlights of the lunch lady &apos;s e @-@ mails .
i found a torrent of all the highlights
if you don &apos;t want to wait for
the ads to load .
abed , that &apos;s stealing .
those ads are there so
the gazette can pay people to
through the lunch lady &apos;s email .
not to get too liberal , but once they &apos;re online ,
does anyone really own the lunch lady &apos;s emails ?
that &apos;s why the future of the internet is branded content .
wazzledazzle.com has got
five bacardi cocktails inspired by
the lunch lady &apos;s most embarrassing secrets .
you guys are violating her privacy .
i &apos;m pretty sure the media &apos;s doing that , britta .
we &apos;re just reading the news .
the police are here about our computers being hacked .
hi , guys .
i see a few familiar faces here .
a few new ones , as well .
no , just gonna keep the cop you &apos;ve known
for for five years at arms length ?
i get it .
what have you boys been able to figure out ?
don &apos;t call us boys .
and it &apos;s a unique case ,
because it &apos;s hard to decide what laws are being broken .
unless you count the lunch lady &apos;s sex life .
thanks , thanks a lot .
anyway , our city does have a cyber @-@ crime division ,
but it &apos;s well , it &apos;s pretty new .
any leads ?
officer warburton .
i want mcdonald &apos;s .
wants .
mcdonald &apos;s .
some of you probably can &apos;t see from where you &apos;re sitting .
it &apos;s literally a child in an adult sized police uniform .
it &apos;s cute , but it doesn &apos;t help our situation .
so what do we make of the demands ?
well we were able to find out a little more .
this message was posted online and signed , the hackers .
and we assume it &apos;s legit because well ,
that &apos;s just where we &apos;re at .
greendale , cancel the performance of the terrorist comedian
gupta gupty gupta , who seeks
to spread hatred with his hateful comedy .
you guys booked gupta gupty gupta ?
$ 700 .
oh my god dean , he &apos;s renowned for his racist act .
how can he be racist ?
listen to his name .
well , the message says
if you don &apos;t cancel his performance ,
what happened to the lunch lady &apos;s gonna happen to
everyone on the activities committee .
we don &apos;t have a- .
oh god , that &apos;s us .
so , what do we do ?
that &apos;s up to the school .
though i &apos;m just a cop , born in a small town ,
raised in the heartland ,
but i say cancel the performance ,
and give the government the sweeping powers
it needs to detect and eliminate people
before they turn into hackers .
think that &apos;s all i &apos;ve got .
how &apos;s everything otherwise ?
stoked for avengers , avengers , avengers , avengers ?
i hear marvel got really hands on this time ,
they really pinned in joss whedon creatively ,
so how can that go wrong ?
okay , see ya .
i guess i &apos;m gonna call a press conference
and announce the comedy is cancelled .
wait hold on .
what &apos;s that ?
do your thing , inspire them .
to do what ?
to rise to the occasion .
to not let these hackers push us around .
don &apos;t you guys think that we have an obligation here ?
the cop says no .
well the cops say
that your car trunk has something to do with 9 / 11 .
they &apos;re not philosophers , they &apos;re crossing guards with guns .
this is on us as a committee .
the eyes of the world- .
are within hundreds of miles of this room .
okay , how about the eyes of something bigger ?
aren &apos;t you an atheist ?
don &apos;t you hate this government ?
are you even planning on going to see this comic ?
yes , pretty much and of course not ,
i was planning to protest him .
but i can &apos;t believe i &apos;m the one saying this .
for god sakes , we &apos;re freaking americans .
we &apos;re talking about freedom of speech ,
it &apos;s the amendment so important
it &apos;s literally the first one they remembered to add .
for white people .
with penises .
we prefer to be called people without color or vaginas .
look , i know some things have gotten too simple
and other things have gotten too complicated ,
but we still have a legacy
and a job in this country .
we &apos;re the colony so high maintenance the british gave up .
we &apos;re so obnoxious the french sent us a statue .
nobody tells us to shut up .
and yes , i know that
our wealth is no longer distributed ,
and yes , our democracy has been
hijacked and turned into a puppet show about two fake parties
that are controlled by a cartel of monopolies ,
and yes , if our votes had any real power
they &apos;d be illegal .
britta ! freedom of speech acknowledged .
trust us .
cancel the show and you cancel people .
might as well bring dinosaurs back .
what ? let her finish .
britta , you saw what they did to the lunch lady .
you wanna guess how much better my emails are ?
you want me to call a press conference
and say , now do me ?
no , i &apos;ll do it .
let them leak me .
i &apos;m not letting you do this alone .
screw it .
i &apos;m in .
someone has to be the last to stand up ,
and now that someone isn &apos;t me .
i kinda zoned out
and assume we &apos;re standing to go see avengers .
these guys are giving hackers a bad name .
and hacker is already such a dumb name .
i &apos;m not an idealist , i &apos;m a pragmatist .
and it &apos;s never pragmatic to piss you guys off .
so , fine .
you guys .
this is so inspiring .
i guess , just let me know how it goes .
no matter what happens i &apos;m with you ,
but don &apos;t tell anyone i &apos;m with you .
if you do , i &apos;ll deny it ,
but i &apos;m with you here and now .
not literally here and now , right now i &apos;m leaving ,
but i will always have been with you secretly .
bye .
the performance by gupta gupty gupta
will go on as scheduled tomorrow night ,
and we encourage anyone who believes in freedom
to attend mr. gupta &apos;s performance .
although , as a woman ,
and someone with many jewish and black friends ,
i will be deeply offended .
i &apos;m petitioning to have mr.gupta
banned from all campuses across america .
but , one thing at a time .
first , freedom of speech
does not just apply to speech you want to hear .
case in point , am i right ?
definitely get my good side , right here .
oh , i &apos;m being censored !
i &apos;m being censored !
anyway , there &apos;s coffee and scotch in the corner .
screw the hackers and long live greendale !
all right , i &apos;ll see you guys at sound check
in the cafeteria tomorrow .
and there is a good chance that we are going to be targeted ,
so nobody gets on the internet tonight .
what do we say ?
no peeking at the leaking .
promise , promise , promise ?
okay .
jeff .
thank you for backing me up , a little .
well , you turned into the path of least resistance .
deflect all you want ,
but you &apos;re putting your ass on the line for an ideal .
well , maybe a fraction of a butt cheek on the line .
it &apos;s not like i used that stupid greendale email for anything
but porn subscriptions and improv show mailing lists .
what makes you think it &apos;s only your greendale email
they &apos;ll be leaking ?
because they hacked greendale .
do you have a computer in your office ?
yes .
do you check your emails on that computer ?
you look at boobies on it ?
one time .
they got it .
they got everything .
it &apos;s vietnam now , baby .
it &apos;s vietnam !
anyways , like i said , thanks .
hello .
hello .
girls .
frankie .
francesca .
word around school is our emails have been leaked .
is that so ?
oh , the first you &apos;ve heard of it ?
i guess i heard some rumblings .
hm , rumblings .
hello , jeff .
hello , jeff .
jeff winger .
annie .
britta .
frankie .
i hear the hackers leaked our emails .
yeah .
something like that .
should we help set up chairs ?
sure .
something was wrong with that one .
bad chair .
hi , how &apos;s everybody doing ?
i asked a damn question .
fine .
new look .
i &apos;m glad you like it .
i &apos;d hate to think my wardrobe
wasn &apos;t passing muster with this group .
so here i am in a brand new outfit
with an up @-@ to @-@ the @-@ minute shirt .
okay .
i &apos;m not usually the best at non @-@ verbal cues , so i have to ask ,
is it possible that everyone here but me
read all of each other &apos;s leaked emails ?
no .
absolutely not .
it &apos;s possible .
i read it all .
i read all your crap .
i have read everything you guys
have ever wrote about me in an email .
and you guys are the worst people in the world .
screw you guys .
not cool .
mean , mean , mean .
point it at me and i will eat it !
what ?
i will bite your little finger off and i will eat it !
then , let &apos;s see you type
more descriptions of my houseguest @-@ era sinbad wardrobe .
that &apos;s a direct quote from a really mean email i wrote about him .
so now who &apos;s the bad guy ?
okay . how much of the leak did each of you read ?
i have a right to fit in !
okay , stop it ! stop it !
why don &apos;t we all just admit that we ...
i &apos;m not admitting it .
oh , annie , get over it .
come on .
you had my blood tested for amphetamines ?
you were extra jumpy last spring .
we had to double check to be safe .
i don &apos;t think i &apos;m jumpy enough if my friends can steal my blood .
oh , you gave it to us .
for that human genome project ?
we only used half of it for that .
by the way , you &apos;re one percent neanderthal .
how can you judge anyone , light switch licker ?
like this , ew .
you guys hear that sound ?
that is the sound of the hackers winning .
our school &apos;s out there right now ,
pawing through our dirty laundry ,
laughing at us , waiting to see what we &apos;re gonna do ,
waiting to see who wins in the battle
between terror and cool .
we got to be cool , man .
we got to be cool .
and set up for a show .
abed , if you wouldn &apos;t mind please checking the sound system .
no problem .
unless you &apos;re too busy telling your girlfriend
i don &apos;t understand donnie darko .
annie .
i &apos;m cool .
i &apos;ll set up the box office .
oh , or will me opening a box office unfairly influence wagers
in your betting pool about my sexual preference ?
we saw this one coming , and we are so sorry .
oh , that cuts it .
the word sorry fills that crater right to the brim , yeah .
oh , boo hoo .
your friends are curious about your night life .
we kept it among friends .
you told human resources i was a functional alcoholic .
i am required to file a report on every teacher ,
and if you throw another tantrum i will revise yours .
to what ? non @-@ lethal murderer ?
armless javelin thrower ?
what in your unqualified , buzzword @-@ bloated ,
little red school house of a brain
is a functional alcoholic ?
what in your brain is a chapstick lesbian ?
to me , 300 bucks .
unless you care to refute it .
my sexuality is of zero concern to my job and to everyone here .
i swear , if you people were trapped on
a tiger @-@ infested island with no food or water ,
you would judge every ship that came to save you .
how does the tigers survive without food or water ?
oh , it &apos;s not cute , annie .
and i read your entry in the pool .
was your goal to win or just be disgusting ?
i had to pick last .
yeah , well , we all read about ourselves in your weirdly long ,
melodramatic emails to your sister ,
who you might notice never responds .
take a hint .
she &apos;s dead .
i pretend to write her emails as a journaling device .
you wretched , evasive little gremlin .
okay , why don &apos;t we just call that rock bottom .
check one , check two .
check one , check two .
well , well , well , it looks like
jeff winger auto @-@ paid his car insurance
and annie &apos;s book club has a meeting tomorrow .
where do you guys find the bad stuff ?
maybe , maybe what we all
need to do here is have everyone in the room
address and own one thing that they know is out there .
no blame , no shame .
just an explanation .
i &apos;ll start .
now , i &apos;m sure by now , you &apos;ve all seen the emails
between me and the patterson family of herndon , virginia .
not me .
no .
i received their first letter as part of a family email chain ,
christmas of 2007 .
i don &apos;t think you owe us .
although , i , i didn &apos;t understand why they &apos;d written me .
i responded politely .
when i realized they had somehow mistaken me for their cousin .
for some reason , i suppose it was loneliness ,
i simply failed to disabuse them of that notion .
well , that &apos;s- .
i &apos;ve come to love barb and george ,
and gelson and roselle .
and even uncle paul with all his flaws .
and even though our relationship is based on a lie ,
for me it &apos;s ...
one of the realest , i &apos;ll ever know .
i hope you don &apos;t think by explaining that ,
you &apos;re off the hook for the 3d models you &apos;ve been making
of our bodies without our permission .
that &apos;s what those photos were for ?
i &apos;m making a game about lady time travelers .
where in your pants ?
that &apos;s pretty creepy , elroy .
oh , you guys are so suave .
you &apos;re such gentlemen .
you and chang have a daily email chain
ranking annie and britta one and two .
by which you mean ,
chang emails me rankings every day and i don &apos;t respond .
except for february 7th , 2013 .
chang , britta is one , annie is two .
jeff , ha , yeah .
jeff , gross .
and britta , way to instantly memorize
the exact date of your big victory .
hey , silver and gold , ladies , ain &apos;t no losers there .
okay , i think we &apos;re losing sight of what &apos;s important .
says the woman suing her father for $ 80 .
tell it to your fake family .
have you made any creepy boob models of jezel yet ?
jezel is like a daughter to me .
but arguably more like a daughter to her parents .
didn &apos;t you have your own family ?
oh , go write an astronaut .
oh , did anyone see jeff &apos;s letters ?
he writes to astronauts .
talk about creepy .
they &apos;re national heroes !
yes , they are !
leave them alone .
ooh , this i gotta see .
you know , what i don &apos;t want to see ?
your exchanges with your life coach
about the study group when we were dating .
oh , and by the way , clearly , not a life coach , and absolutely ,
just an italian sociopath you met at a dispensary .
you two dated ?
this was a study group ?
yeah , chang was our teacher .
what ?
that &apos;s right , and frankly , haven &apos;t been well utilized since .
dear reid wiseman ,
congratulations on your successful return to earth- .
ladies .
video games .
do you have any more advice ?
dear new ensemble ,
i love you more than my dad .
guys .
what !
this is gupta gupty gupta .
yeah , hi .
fine , whatever .
congratulations .
you guys okay ?
to tell you the truth ,
gupta gupty , we &apos;ve been through a bit of a rough patch .
yeah , the dean was telling me about it
and i &apos;ve been reading about it .
hope you were entertained .
to be honest , i &apos;m really grateful .
this is the first school in six months
that hasn &apos;t canceled , so thanks .
i &apos;m gonna go get ready .
we really did the right thing didn &apos;t we ?
yeah .
it doesn &apos;t matter what we read in the leaks
or what we said to each other tonight .
what matters is that right now here on this campus ,
the people are in charge .
not the hackers .
not the media , not the cops , the people .
abed , go put on some music .
elroy , jeff , put out some more chairs .
annie get ready to introduce our star .
chang , go talk to yourself in the corner .
frankie , let the people in .
hey , neil .
hey .
that &apos;s the whole audience ?
i- .
i can &apos;t do a show for one person .
well , you kinda have to .
but i &apos;d rather not .
well , you have to , jackass ,
because there &apos;s more at stake here than what you &apos;d rather do .
oh , god .
there &apos;s a new message from the hackers .
everyone , quiet down !
abed , cut the music .
people of greendale ,
your activities committee has defied our demands ,
and the horrible racist comedian is still about to perform .
yeah , that &apos;s right . we beat you .
if this performance goes on as scheduled ,
all of your information will be published .
if you do not want this to happen ,
you will find a way to stop this performance .
whoa ! stop , stop , hey !
sit down , neil !
you can stop me ,
but you can &apos;t stop the people from stopping this show .
you hear that ?
my god !
it &apos;s the people coming to stop the show .
now what do we do ?
we have to stop the people .
their freedom of speech depends on it .
frankie , chang , bar the doors .
annie , introduce him , quick !
i don &apos;t wanna do this .
listen , you piece of crap , we &apos;ve been to hell and back for you .
get up there and do your stupid act for freedom .
okay , okay .
ladies and gentlemen ,
he &apos;s performed at colleges and clubs all over .
gupta gupty gupta !
hey , y &apos;all .
look , i see there &apos;s a lot of jews in the crowd .
i mean , you know , there isn &apos;t ,
but usually when i do my act , there &apos;s more .
but , you know , i have a whole jew thing .
do it !
okay , okay .
who is this guy ?
stop performing !
do not stop performing !
okay , this guy .
look at him . it looks like he ate so much .
he &apos;s very fat .
don &apos;t do this to me .
shut up and listen .
i see that you &apos;re fat ,
but are you also black or jewish ?
you know , it &apos;s hard to be fat when you &apos;re black or jewish
because when you &apos;re black ,
your community steals all your food ,
so you can &apos;t eat as much .
and when you &apos;re jewish , nobody ever buys anything ,
so you can &apos;t eat as much .
you &apos;re damned if you do , you &apos;re damned if you don &apos;t .
oh , dear god .
the bastards did it .
they leaked the entire school &apos;s data .
oh , okay .
so hey , fat guy in the audience .
have you found anyone else you could love ,
like another fat person ?
or , are you one of those fat people who will always be alone ?
hey , leonard , you enjoy my girlfriend in 2009 ?
as much as she enjoyed your plagiarized poetry .
i will kill you .
don &apos;t act like you care about me .
i &apos;ve seen all of your cartoons about me .
i am this school &apos;s worst nightmare !
i am a .
man , it &apos;s like road warrior out there ,
but if petrol were privacy
and bad teeth were dirty secrets .
good news ! neil &apos;s talking to us again .
he says he respects our moral position ,
but not our execution .
also , he says he &apos;s never talking to us again .
i don &apos;t see how we can bounce back from this one .
this one ?
yeah .
if you follow a theme of revealed secrets ,
the email hack is the third installment of a trilogy
that began with annie losing a pen ,
in what i &apos;ve come to call the golden age .
i &apos;m guessing the second chapter would be
when your best friend vanished on a mysterious boat trip
after the older one masturbated himself to death ?
yeah .
if that &apos;s one you guys bounced back from ,
we might be okay .
what &apos;s the lesson here ?
i always wanna make sure i know what the lesson is .
i &apos;m a completist .
the rest of the school &apos;s in shambles ,
so maybe we &apos;re more evolved and forgiving than them .
we already know that , stupid .
i feel more desensitized to jokes about jews and blacks .
is that good ?
say what ?
we know the pieces of our privacy , freedom of speech ,
terrorism , and government .
so , the lesson is probably an ironic pairing ,
like one man &apos;s privacy is another man &apos;s freedom .
government is terrorism .
the only free speech is private speech .
a free government terrorizes privacy .
that &apos;s all four , bitches .
terror is terrorized by- .
terry the terrorist ?
tarry not , for terrorism terrifies .
government .
speech .
we caught the hacker .
this is ryan , aka stringcheesehustler , aka fartmitzvah ,
skullandboners88 , frozensucked , captaintitty .
you don &apos;t need to know all his names .
he lives across the street from the campus ,
and he &apos;s got something he wants to say .
don &apos;t you ?
i &apos;m sorry .
for what ?
for guessing your school
master password was changeme .
how do you sleep at night , warburton ?
you were one of us .
you were free .
no one &apos;s free when they &apos;re one of anything .
and to answer your question ,
i sleep alone with one eye open .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m not the one in cuffs .
let &apos;s go , fartmitzvah .
crime doesn &apos;t pay .
crime doesn &apos;t pay .
crime doesn &apos;t pay .
i &apos;m sorry if i used photography
to digitally approximate some of your naked bodies .
it &apos;s all right .
it is ?
no !
anything ?
same as yesterday .
big cloud of data raining over a pasture .
all 8 billion sheep keep grazing .
is that good ?
sure .
the thing you said back there about not being a part of anything .
is that really how you feel ?
it &apos;s not a question of how i feel .
i feel like flying .
i don &apos;t jump off buildings .
do you believe in god , warburton ?
you know , there &apos;s no rule that says we have to be friends , right ?
how about common courtesy ? familiar with that rule ?
the words common and courtesy have opposite values .
common courtesy is just gibberish , hocus pocus ,
a spell we cast when hoping to cheat reality .
you &apos;re a cynical son of a bitch .
i &apos;ll give you that .
you know , my wife , she makes these dream catchers .
shut the hell up .
how fast can you get us to the mainframe hardline ?
yankee doodle dandy !
did you get any of that ?
