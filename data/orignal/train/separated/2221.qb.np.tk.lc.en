vanessa diaz ?
i don &apos;t know anyone by that name .
vanessa diaz &apos;s full name
is vanessa diaz waincroft .
she was gabriel &apos;s wife .
she was shot in their home last night ,
and jimmy brigante pulled the trigger .
now , you already know all this , because you &apos;re the one
who sent him over there to get information .
if i knew where to find gabriel waincroft
i would tell you .
the man killed my father .
i want to see him punished as much as you do .
i think that you &apos;d rather see him dead than in prison .
when the officers came to pick her up ,
sara told them that she had an uncle in the police department .
she said his name was chin .
okay .
and no one &apos;s told her about her mom yet , right ?
no .
sara ...
your father , is his name gabriel ?
do you know my daddy ?
she &apos;s just a little kid . you let her go .
that &apos;s not gonna happen .
is she all right ?
yeah .
i know someone who would love to say hello to you .
where &apos;s my mommy ?
you did the right thing .
child services will find a good home for sara .

max , shouldn &apos;t you be giving this
to your boss at the m.e. &apos; s office ?
that would be the appropriate protocol , yes .
but i wanted you to read first .
okay .
how long will you be gone ?
well , the sabbatical will last approximately three months .
however , rest assured you &apos;ll be in the capable hands
of dr. shaw while i &apos;m gone .
what brought this on ?
an epiphany .
yeah ?
yeah , it was during the
ill @-@ fated test run of kamekona &apos;s catamaran tour .
when flippa set the sails ablaze with a flare ,
we found ourselves adrift at sea .
that &apos;s when i realized that i was gonna die
without having fulfilled my lifelong dream
of joining médicins sans frontières .
which in the stateside is known as doctors without borders .
yeah , i &apos;ve , uh , i &apos;ve heard of them , max .
thankfully they are eager to accept volunteers
who have medical training .
so , now , i get to fulfill my lifelong dream
and make a difference to the ambulatory .
i mean , we &apos;re gonna miss you , but ...
this will be an incredible experience .
i &apos;m proud of you , man .
thank you , commander .
would you stop with the handshake , max ?
come on , we &apos;re &apos; ohana . bring it in .
let &apos;s go .
agreed .
however , i feel that a sentimental bro hug
might be a tad bit premature ,
considering i haven &apos;t left yet .
okay .
that &apos;s ... i &apos;ll be here until we apprehend
the people behind the burgeoning meth epidemic .
what , we got another od ?
when ?
this morning .
female , 37 years old .
c.o.d. was respiratory failure brought on by
acute methamphetamine overdose .
toxicology report showed
that it was a lethal mix between fentanyl and crystal meth
that was used to kill our previous eight victims .
mcgarrett .
911 caller recognized gabriel from his picture on the news .
says he &apos;s been living here for the last couple of weeks .
keep it tight in there .
on me , all right ?
abby , post here .
you got rear security .
keep eyes on this door , in case he doubles back .
copy .
got another od victim .
guys , blood trail .
shell casing .
stop .
stop !
stop right there .
roll over , keep your hands where i can see them .
show me your hands .
gabriel waincroft , you &apos;re under arrest .
oh , you believe this , chin ?
after everything we &apos;ve been through ,
i &apos;m gonna die by the hands of some dumb junkie .
yeah , well , here &apos;s another little irony--
we &apos;re gonna save your life .
and then i &apos;m gonna enjoy watching you rot in prison .
you guys got any signal ?
got a signal here ?
no signal , i just checked .
me , neither .
abby ...

you &apos;re doing great .
yes .
there &apos;s a situation .
five @-@ 0 beat us here to the building .
if they take gabriel waincroft into custody ,
he &apos;ll be protected .
you need to make sure that doesn &apos;t happen .
you &apos;re talking about a lot of collateral .
listen to me ,
i want gabriel waincroft dead .
do whatever it takes .
even if you have to kill them all .
we got company .
at least 20 hostiles headed up the north stairwell .
who are your friends , gabriel ?
i don &apos;t have any friends .
you killed them all .
abby , do you copy ?
abby ?
my condolences .
shut up !
you &apos;re done talking for the day .
listen to me , all right ?
we hold our ground
and then we go find abby .
move !
move !
okay , that &apos;s gotta be shioma &apos;s people .
well , that makes sense .
she &apos;s been looking for gabriel for weeks .
which means they &apos;re not gonna stop
until they get what they want .
is there a back entrance to this place ?
no .
huh ? you sure ?
what are you doing ?
trying to find the open hpd channel .
got it .
hpd dispatch .

to captain lou grover .
this is captain grover .
captain , i have an emergency patch @-@ in
from commander steve mcgarrett .
all right , put him through .
lou .
mcgarrett , what &apos;s going on ?
we got gabriel ,
but shioma &apos;s people hit the building
and we &apos;re under fire ; we are under fire .
how the hell does she even know he was in there ?
i don &apos;t know . they &apos;ve jammed our cells , okay ?
i need you to grab swat .
send hpd to our location right now .
i &apos;m on it .

still no word from abby . we gotta go back .
i wouldn &apos;t worry too much about her , chin .
i &apos;m sure she &apos;s fine .
hey , what &apos;d i tell you about talking ?
i &apos;ll go back with you , chin .
i &apos;m not risking abby &apos;s life for his .
nobody is . nobody is , okay ?
but no one &apos;s going anywhere .
we gotta stay together . we gotta stay on this rooftop .
we leave this rooftop ,
we lose the only tactical advantage that we have .
we stick together ,
we wait for grover , all right ?
chin , i promise you ,
we &apos;re not gonna leave abby behind .
all right .
all right ?
grover , you copy ?
yeah , i copy .

watch out .
yeah .
all right .
we &apos;re gonna jump .
what &apos;d you just say ?
excuse me ?
jump . we &apos;re gonna jump .
what do you mean jump ?
we can &apos;t jump . that &apos;s ten feet across .
it &apos;s the only way off of this thing .
besides , this building is taller than that building .
it &apos;s gonna cut the jump by , like , three feet .
so it &apos;s fine .
oh , really ? oh , really ?
doctor ? well , i &apos;m not so sure
about your mathematics , steve .
would you trust me , for once in your life ?
trust you ?
steve , we might be able to make that jump .
there &apos;s no way that he can .
well , he has to .
i can do it .
doubtful .
look at it this way ,
i come up short , i die .
you get what you want .
i make it ...
take me to prison .
you still get what you want .
all right , we got to go .
we got to go right now .
chin , on me .
guys , we got to go right now .
‭ right now .
how about we don &apos;t commit suicide ,
and we stand here and we shoot all the bad guys
when they come out the door ? how about that ?
good plan , danny , what about when your ammo runs out ?
what do you got , four bullets left , huh ?
what are you gonna do then ?
all right , fine .
steve , you win ,
but i hate it and it &apos;s a stupid idea , okay ?
it &apos;s a very stupid idea and you are going to apologize
to all my family members at my funeral , you understand ?
yeah , no problem .
it &apos;d be a pleasure , okay ?
kono , you and danny first . let &apos;s go .
no , you go . you go first .

no , we lost them .
they &apos;re somewhere in chinatown .
but with all the gunfire ,
hpd will be here any minute .
we need to stand down .
you stand down . i won &apos;t just kill you ,
i &apos;ll kill everyone you love ,
and i &apos;ll do them first ,
so you &apos;ve learned your lesson before you die .
reinforcements are on their way .
forget hpd . i &apos;ve taken care of them .
just make sure you find waincroft .
sit him down .
his pulse is weak .
lou , do you read me ? come in . lou .
kono , you get any signal ?
there &apos;s still no signal .
they must be jamming the network in the whole area .
all right , this ...
is not right , all right ?
even though cell phones don &apos;t work ,
hpd would be flooded with calls right now .
they should be here , huh ?
unless hpd &apos;s communications have been compromised .
maybe shioma has someone on the inside ,
making sure the calls don &apos;t get through .
well , that would explain how they knew
about the 911 call and gabriel .
and that grover and swat are on the way .
there was talk shioma had a mole inside hpd .
guess it was true .
guys , it &apos;s abby . do you read me ?
abby .
hey , where are you ?
you okay ?
yeah .
yeah , i &apos;m with lou .
we &apos;re both okay .
swat got hit pretty hard .
how about you guys ?
we &apos;re fine .
for now .
are you getting any cell phone signal ?
no , cell is down in the entire area .
grover radioed for hpd backup and an ambulance ,
but they haven &apos;t shown up yet .
yeah , well , they &apos;re not gonna show up .
we think that hpd &apos;s been compromised .
abby , it &apos;s steve .
listen , i need you to reach out to coughlin .
see if he &apos;s been investigating
any dirty cops with ties to michelle shioma .
i doubt they &apos;ll talk to me , but i &apos;ll give it a try .
listen , i &apos;m gonna hand you off to grover .
i &apos;ll keep you posted if i find out anything .
you guys ...
lou , hey . you all right ?
barely .
abby saved my ass .
listen , give me your location . i &apos;m coming to you .
no , forget about it . we &apos;re not sticking around .
you know i &apos;m not gonna sit this one out , right ?
i &apos;m not asking you to .
listen to me , lou , get to a landline ,
contact duke on his cell phone .
have him mobilize esu .
but make sure he circumvents the normal communication channels .
okay . what are you gonna do ?
i &apos;m gonna find some transportation
and get gabriel to a hospital .
all right , fine .
two words you never listen to , ever :
be careful .
yeah .
transportation , that &apos;s , that &apos;s a fantastic plan .
what about the yakuza death squad
that &apos;s outside waiting for us ?
how are we gonna get through them ?
i &apos;m still working on that .
he &apos;s working on it .
jerry , we good to go ?
yup .
navy intel just patched me into their titan 4d satellite ,
and fyi , it &apos;s totally awesome .
all right , jerry ,
did you make sure that we are communicating
on the secure channel ?
please , i &apos;ve been working radio frequencies since i was six .
high chatter routes , from honolulu to roswell ,
so trust me when i tell you that the president himself
couldn &apos;t listen in on our comms .
okay , good .
then get us the hell out of here .
on it .
okay , according to the architectural blueprints
of the hawaii theatre ,
there should be a door near the back right of the stage .
that is your egress point .
i got it .
get him up . we &apos;re out of here .
let &apos;s go .
head down the alley .
hang a right . towards king street .
should be a lot of traffic there .
jerry , where is everyone ?
uh , max , now &apos;s not a real good time .
i &apos;m helping the five @-@ 0 navigate the streets of chinatown
so they don &apos;t killed by a bunch of yakuza madmen .
well , is there anything i can do to help ?
not unless you have an ak @-@ 47 and a jet pack .
unfortunately , i do not have either of those items .
hey , guys ,
we got two bogeys coming in your direction
from the alley up ahead .
call of duty , my ass .
good work , jerry .
oh , shh ! red alert !
two suvs just pulled away , headed in your direction .

nice timing , lou .
i finally got a hold of duke .

at beretenia and lisbon .
chin , this alleyway on the right ,
that &apos;s our alley , okay ?

jerry , you there ?
like al in die hard , buddy .
just hang a left on fort street mall
and head toward beretenia .
path &apos;s all clear .
my office said you needed to see me .
you got five minutes .
we think michelle shioma has a mole inside hpd .
i need to know if you &apos;re looking at anyone connected to her .
so it &apos;s &quot; we &quot; now ?
i sent you in there
to help me take them down , abby ,
not become one of them .
we have gabriel waincroft in custody .
five @-@ 0 was extracting him ,
when shioma sent in a team to assassinate him .
they &apos;re literally under attack , as we speak .
what the hell are you doing here ?
trying to save my friends .
whoever shioma has
inside hpd is blocking communication ,
so we can &apos;t call for backup
because we don &apos;t know who we can trust .
that &apos;s why i need your help .
robert ...
if you ever want to see waincroft stand trial
for the murder of your brother , you &apos;ll get me a name .
give me a half hour to cross @-@ reference all my cases .
if shioma &apos;s got someone on the inside , i &apos;ll find them for you .
thank you .
i &apos;m not gonna make it .
get up . get up !
you &apos;re making it to the hospital ,
if i have to drag you there myself .
don &apos;t turn right . don &apos;t turn right .
they turned right .
thanks , max . i can see that .
chin , you got a bogey heading your direction .
gotta get off the street .
like , now .
okay . any thoughts on that , jer ?
i &apos;m working on it .
okay , there &apos;s an apartment building across the street .
glass doors , gold trim . you see it ?

he needs medical attention .
sir , it &apos;s okay . i &apos;m with five @-@ 0 .
please go back inside your home .
what &apos;s the latest ?
chin and gabriel are holed up in an apartment building .
shioma &apos;s men don &apos;t know where they are .
what about everyone else ?
well , someone gave them bad advice about boarding a bus .
yeah , but it &apos;s not important who .
okay , it was me .
but you see the dead bodies all around it ? we won .
well , i guess shioma &apos;s gonna need some more bad guys .
this car &apos;s basically undriveable .
this one , too .
jerry , how far is that apartment ?
half a mile .
half a mile ...
let &apos;s go .
you &apos;re wasting your time .
get it through your head : you &apos;re not dying today .
you son of a bitch .
please ...
damn it .
max , are you there ?
yes , lieutenant .
max , i can &apos;t stop the bleeding .
well , i suggest you cauterize the wound .
yeah , how do i do that ?
ambroise paré ,
the french barber surgeon ,
who was a pioneer in battlefield medicine ,
used to cauterize wounds with gunpowder .
okay , how much do i need ?
how big is the wound ?
about an inch .
half a round should suffice .
uh , jesse , right ?
yes . jesse , i need uh , uh , a pair of pliers
and a @-@ a box of wooden matches , okay ?
coming right up .
i can &apos;t go to jail .
you don &apos;t have a choice .
chin ...
i &apos;m sorry about your father .
i need you to do something for me , chin .
i need you to look after sara .
i know that you saved her ,
and i know what happened to vanessa .
if you knew what happened to her ,
then why didn &apos;t you ever see your daughter ?
because i knew you
would &apos;ve been waiting for me .
you know ...
... she looks just like malia .
yeah .
don &apos;t do it for me , chin ...
do it for my sister .
malia would have been sara &apos;s aunt .
that little girl ...
she &apos;s our blood .
here you go .
bite on this .
hey , chin ,
that suv from earlier
just did a loop around the block
and stopped outside your location .
they &apos;re close .
how far away is mcgarrett ?
three blocks .
might as well be 30 .
excuse me .
did you find anything ?
yeah , officer by the name of natalie ochoa ,
works in hpd communications .
her name cross @-@ referenced with solomon tuasopo .
he &apos;s the guard from halawa .
he &apos;s on shioma &apos;s payroll .
that &apos;s right .
ochoa &apos;s personnel file revealed
tuasopo &apos;s her brother @-@ in @-@ law .
i.a. looked into her but didn &apos;t find anything .
it &apos;s got to be her .
i &apos;m on my way to see her now .
i &apos;ll meet you there .
honolulu police department , district 1 .
what &apos;s your emergency ?
two men just forced themselves
into my neighbor &apos;s apartment across the hall ,
and i think i recognized one of them
from those wanted posters all over the island . uh ...
gabriel waincroft .
sir , what &apos;s the address ?
220 beretenia street , apartment 2d .
please , stay inside your residence .
i &apos;m dispatching a unit immediately .

five @-@ 0 , stay down , stay down .
don &apos;t move !
you , you , down !
forget it , cowboy .

mahalo , jerry .
i feel a badge coming my way .

steve .

a tunnel .
looks like el chapo designed her bathroom .
call the fbi .
tell them we got a fugitive .
michelle shioma &apos;s gone .
she &apos;s in the wind .
the fbi &apos;s on it , but , uh ,
she &apos;s got the resources to disappear .
yeah , she does .
any word on gabriel ?
he went into cardiac arrest in surgery .
he didn &apos;t make it , steve .
okay .
you know , it &apos;s strange .
i thought i wouldn &apos;t feel anything .
hey , buddy ...
you could never have changed that guy , okay ?
you tried--
prison wouldn &apos;t have even changed him .
you need to know that .
he wants me to look after sara .
just because he had a kid
did not make him a father , all right ?
and you and i both know the best thing for that little girl
is that gabriel gets put into the ground .
at least now she &apos;s got the chance at a normal life .
i &apos;m not ready to be a dad .
