i &apos;m in love with his little nose .
yeah , that &apos;s a cute one .
oh , it &apos;s his face , and i &apos;m in love with him .
oh , my god . it just got real .
yeah . are we really doing this ?
i think we are .
are you a little freaked out ?
yeah , a little , but in a good way , right ?
yeah .
right .
you figure out how to use the stroller
and the car seat , the base thingy ?
i think you just gave me a honey @-@ do list , which --
wait . you &apos;re officially a mom .
you know , um ...
i &apos;ve decided i want to stay home for a little while ,
spend some time with the baby and --
are you serious ? can you do that ?
i mean , aren &apos;t you -- uh , you could lose your job .
this is more important .
there &apos;s nothing more profound and of lasting consequence
than the decision to have a child .
the exploitation and perversion of that decision
is the stock and trade of a truly evil organization --
the cyprus adoption agency .
adoption ?
you want me to believe this is a coincidence ?
tom and i are adopting a baby ,
and you serve up an adoption agency ?
life is full of lovely little ironies .
the cyprus agency offers a promise
of something very special -- perfection .
their clients are ordering from an unlimited genetic menu ,
the characteristics of the child they want to bring home .
but the evil is not in what the agency offers .
it &apos;s in how they get it done .
our business is probability .
all the children available for adoption
have some genetic advantage .
i &apos;m owen . owen mallory . hi .
mr. mallory is our founder and c.e.o.
adoption is a big decision .
that &apos;s why we try to make it as simple as we possibly can .
you select your preferences .
we scour the planet for a child that matches that criteria .
oh , this is , um , ted caldwell .
the martins , from montreal .
ted &apos;s our general counsel .
the cyprus agency is in the abduction business .
they don &apos;t locate kids for adoption .
they steal them and adopt them out to new parents .
and moving stolen children is difficult .
there &apos;s copious amounts of paperwork .
they &apos;re using a forger .
one of the best .
but i &apos;m biased . he &apos;s one of my best .
lizzy , i &apos;m giving you the chance
to take down a criminal organization
that is abducting babies from their mothers &apos; arms .
this is the next child the cyprus agency will deliver ,
a boy , less than two weeks from now .
who is he really ?
i have no idea .
but he &apos;s about to become
the child of david and wendy roland .
so , where did he come from ?
i don &apos;t know .
our source says he may have been abducted .
oh , my god .
abduction ? abducted from whom ?
y @-@ you &apos;re saying he may never be our son ?
w @-@ we &apos;ve been through all the details .
what , y @-@ you &apos;re saying there may be another mother out there
who &apos;s looking for him ?
s @-@ so , what do you need us to do ?
i just want to take a moment
to congratulate you .
i know how excited you both are
and how long a road this has been .
someone from our nursing staff will be reaching out
to make arrangements for you and the baby to meet .
do you have a question ?
no .
just -- we &apos;ve heard about birth parents
changing their mind at the last minute .
just want to make sure everything &apos;s accurate .
rest assured . your case , like every case
he &apos;s gonna spook him .
he &apos;s got to ask about the adoption .
our agency does exhaustive
preparation and research that involves a large network
of the most reputable contacts both here and overseas .
your agency said he came from an orphanage in estonia .
can you tell us anything more about that ?
such as ?
well , i @-@ i don &apos;t know . you hear stories --
what these kids went through before they found a home .
oh . no , no , no .
i assure you , you have nothing to worry about .
now , as the agency &apos;s lawyer ,
i &apos;m not involved with the children directly .
but ... well , maybe you could give us
the name of someone in the agency who is .
you should absolutely feel free to speak
with one of our adoption consultants .
would you ... excuse me ? i have to take this phone call .
i think we have a situation here .
they &apos;re asking questions about estonia .
that &apos;s it . we got him . move . move . move .
no . no , it just feels funny .
i don &apos;t think they &apos;re onto anything ,
theodore caldwell ?
excuse me ?
fbi .
no , no , no .
we need to talk .
fbi ? about what ? talk about what ? this is a misunderstanding .
we know about the abduction .
what abduction ? !
you can do the right thing here .
you can help us .
you don &apos;t understand .
you can help us . tell us about the agency .
no loose ends . i &apos;m already dead .
help us find the real parents .
real parents ?
oh , my god . you have no idea .
i &apos;m -- i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m sorry .
the truth is , the cypress agency --
she &apos;s a tough little punjab .
doesn &apos;t talk so much .
that &apos;s why you &apos;re here , mr. brimley .
she &apos;s telling the truth .
don &apos;t bet the trailer money , but i pushed her hard ,
and i &apos;m telling you -- that girl &apos;s cleaner than a duck fart .
thank you , teddy .
let &apos;s talk .
already did .
yes , but now that you &apos;ve been vetted by mr. brimley ,
i &apos;m more inclined to listen .
like i said , to get into the black site so quickly ,
garrick had to have the site layout in advance .
which you gave to him .
no .
i have an rfp we recovered from the trash
of a government contractor , signed by meera malik .
you leak classified data in the name of improving security .
no . i was authorized to start the bidding process .
authorized by whom ?
i don &apos;t know .
all i know is that cooper handed me the order .
putting a bullet in my head gets you nothing .
but letting me help you might get us both what we want .
and why would you want to help me , agent malik ?
someone on the inside betrayed us .
colleagues of mine were killed .
we both want the same thing .
let me go , and i &apos;ll find out who did it .
the order was classified .
you let me worry about that .
you can &apos;t .
those files are confidential .
warrant . i need you to step outside .
get that hard drive to aram .
we need a full work @-@ up on it , pronto .
agent ressler ?
mr. mallory .
i see you got my message .
i did .
i just -- i don &apos;t really understand .
i ...
neither do we .
but it &apos;s clear an adoption
being brokered by this agency is a fraud .
well , i @-@ i can &apos;t believe that .
if there was a misstep with a case ,
it undoubtedly happened overseas .
all of the legal aspects on our end are dealt with
by ted caldwell and his team ,
who i am completely confident in .
someone got it wrong .
all right , agent .
you &apos;re welcome to examine all the records , warrant or not ,
but if there was a false claim made , believe me --
you should be looking into our overseas partners .
we &apos;re launching a wider investigation .
until we &apos;re done , you &apos;re out of the adoption business .
understood . i just ordered an internal review myself .
look , this agency is only as strong as its reputation ,
so i want answers as much as you do .
anything you need -- anything -- just let me know .
27 files .
that &apos;s 27 adoptions brokered in the last 3 years alone .
is that a lot ?
that &apos;s a lot ,
especially when you &apos;re adopting out infants ,
and that &apos;s almost never done internationally .
but there &apos;s the thing . i &apos;ve gone through every case file .
i can &apos;t authenticate a single adoption .
one child was supposedly born to a birth mother in lithuania ,
but i can &apos;t find any record of the birth .
they &apos;re smart . the trails lead to facts we can &apos;t verify
instead of something we can prove is a lie .
bring me evidence . make the case .
compare the kids delivered by the cypress agency
to police reports of missing kids .
i &apos;ll call interpol , check their database .
a lot of their missing @-@ persons files have dna on record .
we should coordinate dna panels on all the kids .
let &apos;s do it .
sir ?
i wanted to talk with you about something .
it &apos;s a personal matter .
good of you to join us .
sir , rough night . my daughter was sick .
i agreed to let you join this task force with the promise
that family wouldn &apos;t be an issue .
i don &apos;t mean to be a hard @-@ ass ,
but in this unit , job comes first , second , and third .
bring her up to speed .
you wanted to talk to me about something ?
it can wait .
the fbi is looking into the cypress agency .
there have been some allegations .
and that &apos;s why we &apos;re asking for dna .
we can confirm -- say , &quot; ah . &quot; good girl --
that she is who the agency claims she is .
i know this is hard . i have a daughter myself .
and you have every right to speak to a lawyer .
but we have a court order authorizing us to collect dna .
here , open up . i promise this won &apos;t hurt .
it &apos;s okay . it &apos;s okay , honey .
there you go . that &apos;s my boy .
very good boy .
aww , you did it . mommy &apos;s got you .
i think this will be my last case for awhile .
i &apos;m gonna spend some time at home ,
be with the baby .
how &apos;s the case coming along ?
we compared the dna to every known sample on file
for missing or abducted kids -- not a single hit .
the cyprus agency delivered 27 children ,
all unaccounted for .
nobody &apos;s ever reported them missing .
you &apos;re so linear .
what &apos;s that supposed to mean ?
the fbi and the police --
the way they teach you to think never ceases to amaze me .
lizzy , not every missing child
is on the back of a milk carton .
who wouldn &apos;t report a missing child ?
people who won &apos;t or can &apos;t go to the police .
criminals .
run the dna again .
this time , don &apos;t look for an exact match .
look at the relatives .
you want to find where those kids came from , that &apos;s how .
you &apos;re arriving at a point of no return , lizzy .
if you have any doubts about your husband ,
you can &apos;t go through with this adoption .
when you get there ,
if there is even one shred of doubt --
there isn &apos;t .
keen , the dna results are in .
we get a hit ?
we got five . you need to see this .
five hits , all women .
according to the dna , these five women
are the biological mothers of 12 of the 27 kids .
the mothers .
let me guess . they &apos;re in prison .
no .
they &apos;re not in the system because they &apos;re criminals --
they &apos;re in the system because they &apos;re missing .
missing ?
all five of them .
five women --
all attractive , smart , in their early 20s .
all five were in college when they disappeared .
four of the five disappeared without a trace .
allison hayes --
she was a physics student at b.u.
she went to class one monday morning and vanished .
the police reports are almost identical .
these were clean grabs , no witnesses .
all except one .
kate ellison , also 20 .
she goes drinking with a fake i.d. at a bar near brown
when she &apos;s a sophomore .
she got taken on the walk home .
a witness said they saw her fighting with a man
who then pushes her into a van ,
but no i.d. was possible .
so , they &apos;re not taking children . they &apos;re taking women .
what &apos;s the timeline ?
kate ellison was taken three years ago .
wait . that can &apos;t be right .
according to the dna test , kate &apos;s the mother
of two children delivered by the cyprus agency .
they &apos;re 1 and 2 years old .
so she gave birth after she was taken ?
she didn &apos;t only give birth .
she got pregnant after she was taken .
so did allison hayes ...
and michelle lefferts .
the kids matching their dna
were conceived after they were abducted .
these women are alive . they &apos;re still out there .
you need something ?
it &apos;s about the mole hunt .
what about it ?
reddington &apos;s been speaking to keen .
he believes that someone in our unit
provided the intruders with intel critical to the breach .
counter intelligence has concluded
that newton phillips acted alone .
you disagree ?
i &apos;m feeling very mistrustful .
do you have actionable intel to support this ... hunch ?
no .
malik ...
i hope your daughter feels better .
you are looking at ted caldwell &apos;s computer ,
the one we seized from his office .
now , most of it was routine ,
but deep in the background
was a file nobody wanted found .
&quot; purchase orders . &quot; what exactly was he buying ?
not buying . from the looks of it ,
i &apos;d say it &apos;s something he intended to acquire .
i had them printed .
it &apos;s a complete dossier -- medical profile ,
grades going back to middle school ,
athletic and extracurricular interests .
charlotte patterson -- in her second year at georgetown .
you think she could be the agency &apos;s next target ?
we can &apos;t afford to risk it .
we need to get her into protective custody .
i just talked to the university .
she &apos;s in a chemistry class at regents hall
until 5 : 00 p.m.
move . move .
class is dismissed . she &apos;s gone .
give me something , aram .
her car &apos;s still there .
she swiped in at the parking structure near campus ,
hasn &apos;t swiped out .
keen , keen , car .
oh , geez . we &apos;ve got her books .
in the van ! step out !
mandell parking garage , shots fired !
there &apos;s a kidnapped suspect in a blue van !
virginia plate -- 8 @-@ 1 , sam , echo , michael , 3 @-@ 6 !
you okay ?
you call me at the office ?
you didn &apos;t answer the cell . i tried you half a dozen times .
perry , the cell is retired .
we went dark . you recall ?
no business .
they &apos;re onto me .
the last pickup , the feds were there .
how did they know the target ?
why are you out making pickups when i said to hold off ?
on new orders , but this was old business .
we lost one the other day .
the lawyer told me to get a replacement .
you should have checked with me first .
where is she ?
she &apos;s in the van , sedated .
okay . show me .
the lawyer said to get a replacement .
the lawyer &apos;s dead .
charlotte patterson never made it home from class .
she was definitely inside that van .
her cell &apos;s not active . we &apos;re setting up checkpoints ,
and every law @-@ enforcement agency
in a 200 @-@ mile radius has her photo ,
along with the make , model , and plate number of the van .
where are we on mallory ?
waiting on documents from overseas .
and the files we seized at the agency
have caldwell &apos;s name all over them .
but there &apos;s no paper trail
proving mallory or anyone else knew what was going on .
are you saying he &apos;s innocent ?
no .
we &apos;ve interviewed employees on three continents --
accountants , marketing , researchers .
they all seem to be clean .
we need proof !
and it would be nice to get it before another woman is abducted .
where are we ?
that &apos;s my question for you .
what &apos;s with the new girl ? i thought we were done .
we are . she was a mistake .
the fbi is looking at everyone .
well , there &apos;s no link to my clinic .
we were very careful .
i don &apos;t care . shut it down .
what happened the other day ? perry said we lost one .
couldn &apos;t be avoided . perry took care of it .
flounder !
hey , where did you go , bud ?
hey , flounder , what have you got there ?
name is kate ellison .
computer said the fbi is looking for her .
thanks for the call .
you get a cause of death ?
single gunshot wound .
and that &apos;s about the only thing in this that makes any sense .
just h @-@ hang on a second . let me get my file .
what are you thinking ?
nothing good .
kate ellison had blond hair and blue eyes .
she dies , and a day or two later ,
charlotte patterson gets taken .
it &apos;s the same type .
maybe the agency needed a replacement .
okay , kate ellison , abducted at the age of 20 .
she dies at the age of 23 .
so , where has she been for the last three years ?
i would say nowhere .
meaning ?
let &apos;s start with the muscle tone .
she has severe muscular atrophy .
her arms , her legs ,
all the major muscle groups are deteriorated .
what would cause that ?
inactivity -- i don &apos;t think that this woman
has stood upright for any length of time in years .
she was in an induced coma .
the needle marks on her arm suggest
that she was fed through a tube .
okay , now , here &apos;s where my findings go
from the crazy to the totally insane .
she &apos;s given birth -- several times .
how is that possible in her condition , though ?
well , she was heavily sedated
and she &apos;s lost a lot of muscle mass ,
but she &apos;s actually in great shape to deliver a child .
her folic acid , her calcium , her iron were all incredibly high .
so , whoever &apos;s been keeping her
has been giving her prenatal care .
if she was shot , maybe she was trying to escape .
that would be pretty tough .
she was on some very heavy sedation --
a benzodiazepine called hydroxipam .
thank you .
aram , what do you have ?
it &apos;s about owen mallory . cooper said get into his life ,
so i started with his undergrad degree from harvard .
oh , let me guess . he never went .
oh , no , he went .
here &apos;s the thing -- he went under a different name .
owen mallory was enrolled as charles lassiter jr .
he falsified his transcripts , applied as the only son
of charles and jill lassiter from bethesda .
we &apos;ve got something on mallory .
aram , send us the lassiters &apos; address .
i know this must be a shock .
his name is owen mallory .
he attended harvard , claiming to be your son .
i &apos;m sorry . what did you say his name is now ?
&quot; now &quot; ? mrs. lassiter , do you know this man ?
he was our son .
the boy we knew was named michael shaw .
and when we met him ,
he was 7 years old and in foster care .
so you adopted him .
he was with us for 16 months .
charles and i --
i mean , we knew michael was troubled .
but nothing could have prepared us for ...
t @-@ the therapist called it severe attachment disorder .
uh ... a @-@ and there -- there --
there were many therapists , all kinds .
we tried .
i know -- i know how that sounds .
but -- but when michael began threatening
to hurt himself and -- and us ,
then the doctors stepped in and felt ...
... for , uh ...
for michael to return ... to foster care .
i &apos;m so sorry . that must have been very difficult .
no , i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s just , in many ways ...
charles and i blame ourselves .
in hindsight , we weren &apos;t ready . we ...
the marriage was troubled .
we -- we just weren &apos;t equipped for a child .
directive for a mandatory security upgrade .
the person who ordered it signed page 6 .
our business is done , agent malik .
sorry i &apos;m late .
what the hell is this place ?
not at all what it seems .
what are we doing here ?
i told you -- i need help tracking hydroxipam .
there &apos;s no federal prescription database .
i can &apos;t subpoena every pharmacy on the east coast .
you don &apos;t have to .
did you know the earliest @-@ known cul @-@ de @-@ sac
is over 2,000 years old ,
unearthed in el @-@ lahun , egypt ?
aristotle himself was a big fan --
said they made it difficult
for the enemy to find their way while attacking .
now , be polite . you &apos;re about to meet
one of the nicest narcotics dealers this side of cleveland .
russell .
red . what &apos;s up , fool ?
smells delicious , russell .
mescaline steam bath .
you want a hit ?
oh , my god .
if only i could do just one . no , thank you .
no , last time i played around with that ,
i ended up naked in the desert
trying to hitch a ride to tuba city .
those navajo tacos -- oh ! heaven !
when was this ?
uh , about two years ago .
she seems like a cop .
thank you .
you see ? i keep telling her that .
she doesn &apos;t listen to me .
listen , russell , this isn &apos;t a social call .
i came for your professional opinion .
i need to know about hydroxipam .
sure , yeah , i know all about that --
that and the betamax and the blackberry .
i don &apos;t understand the reference .
nobody wants it .
uh , hydro is supposed to be a sleep aid ,
but it &apos;s crazy powerful -- too powerful .
the half @-@ life &apos;s like 100 hours .
so ?
so , people need to get up in the morning .
where can i get it ?
you don &apos;t want it .
i do .
okay .
but i got to tell you ,
i don &apos;t think most pharmacies even stock it now .
luckily , i have access to their inventories .
there . see ?
only three pharmacies in 1,200 miles carry hydro .
and of those , only eight doctors wrote scripts in the last year .
what &apos;s this code here ?
that &apos;s what kind of doctor wrote the prescription .
looks like seven are sleep therapists , and one ...
is a fertility doctor .
fbi . we need to talk with dr. gideon hadley .
dr. hadley &apos;s in a meeting .
you &apos;ll just have to interrupt .
i &apos;m not sure waiting is such a --
what have ...
fbi . they &apos;re asking for you .
if there are loose ends , they are not on my side .
take it easy , everybody .
they don &apos;t know anything .
they &apos;re just here to talk .
if they knew something , they would have sent a s.w.a.t. team .
talk to them .
be your charming self . get them to leave .
by the time they get back ,
there won &apos;t be anything for them to find .
and if i can &apos;t ?
take care of it , nestor .
i &apos;m so sorry .
dr. hadley actually stepped out for the afternoon .
i thought you said he was in a meeting .
i thought he was . he &apos;ll be back in a few hours .
you &apos;re welcome to wait .
great .
in the meantime ,
i think we &apos;ll give ourselves a tour of the facility .
find hadley .
keen .
i &apos;m okay .
call it in .
22 victims , all alive ,
including charlotte patterson ,
the girl we lost at georgetown .
allison hayes and michelle lefferts --
we got them all .
except kate ellison .
you solved all those missing @-@ persons reports in one case .
and the mothers of every one of those 27 kids have been accounted for .
sir , there &apos;s a complete ivf laboratory .
the women &apos;s eggs were surgically retrieved ,
fertilized here , and then re @-@ transferred .
it &apos;s all state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art .
the genetic testing is cutting @-@ edge .
it &apos;s remarkable . some of the charts go back years .
well done .
we found kate ellison .
and i &apos;m guessing that &apos;s not the only body
we &apos;ll find before this is done .
is it ... michael ?
we know who you are .
michael shaw ...
adopted at 7 by charles and jill lassiter
and returned to foster care 16 months later .
owen mallory has no record , but ...
michael shaw -- he &apos;s quite a con man , isn &apos;t he ?
thank you .
you must have felt so rejected , being removed --
i wasn &apos;t removed .
i was returned ...
like a defective toy .
i met the lassiters .
is that why you did this ?
to get back at them ?
the lassiters didn &apos;t want a child .
they wanted an accessory to smile for their christmas card .
they wanted perfection ,
like all the others .
so i sell what people want .
everybody wins .
they get their little geniuses , and--
and you and your employees get rich ?
no .
well , yes .
but it &apos;s not about the money for me .
what does that mean ?
i think i &apos;ve said enough .
but my legacy is complete .
and there is nothing you can do to change that .
your legacy .
you &apos;re the father .
the children brokered by the cyprus agency are yours .
why ?
well , i was damaged goods , wasn &apos;t i ?
not fit to survive in their privileged world .
well , i am surviving .
now part of me is thriving in every home
that has my child .
honey ?
what &apos;s wrong ?
are you okay ?
i can &apos;t do it .
do what ?
you &apos;re not ready .
we &apos;re not ready .
no , look-- you don &apos;t have to take any time off , all right ?
just-- there &apos;s a lot of working moms out there ,
and you can do both .
no .
you can do both .
tom ...
it &apos;s us .
it &apos;s us .
i don &apos;t know what &apos;s wrong .
i don &apos;t understand it , but something &apos;s not right .
i can &apos;t have a baby right now .
well , i don &apos;t know what to say to that .
honey , you can &apos;t tell me that there &apos;s not one shred of doubt ,
one shred that wonders ...
if this is ...
broken .
what the hell are you doing in my house ?
i know , diane .
what ?
you signed a directive
ordering a mandatory security upgrade at the post office .
it &apos;s how you got the blueprints into enemy hands .
you &apos;re the dirty rat , diane .
i &apos;m calling the police .
no , you &apos;re not .
you stupid son of a bitch .
sit your ass down .
i signed that directive for your protection .
you remind me of this woman i knew in lisbon .
strange old bird .
if you think fitch or any of his people
are going to let you get away with this ,
you &apos;re more arrogant than i thought .
we came into the post office to make a point .
if you come after me ,
if you so much as lay a finger on me --
you talk too much .
you can &apos;t shoot me .
why not ?
you &apos;re not one of the good guys .
and , as of today , you &apos;re utterly worthless to the bad guys .
fitch and i have an agreement .
he goes about his business . i go about mine .
you and i don &apos;t have an agreement .
i know the truth , red ...
about that night ...
about what happened to your family .
do you want to know the truth ?
more than anything in the world .
but if you know the truth , diane ,
then somebody else does , too .
can i tell you something ...
about reddington ?
i hate working with the man .
he &apos;s dangerous , amoral .
he pathologically flaunts authority .
he &apos;s reckless to the point of suicidal .
but all this , everything we &apos;ve done --
none of this would have been possible if it weren &apos;t for him .
go home , malik .
