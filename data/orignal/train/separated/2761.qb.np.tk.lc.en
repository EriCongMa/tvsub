and we &apos;re done with the yogurt .

the impressions in the butter left little to the imagination .
how about if we split it ?

that &apos;s patio furniture .
so what ? like people will come in and think , &quot; oh , l &apos; m outside again . &quot;
fine .
what about the birds ?
i don &apos;t know . they don &apos;t say , &quot; hello , sit here . eat something . &quot;
you pick one .
okay . how about the ladybugs ?
forget about the birds , but big red insects suggest fine dining .
fine ! want the birds ? get the birds !
not like that , i won &apos;t .
kip would have liked the birds .
hi , pheebs .
what &apos;s going on ?
are you moving out ?
l &apos; m getting ready for the weekend .
are your weekends longer than two days ?
these aren &apos;t all my suitcases .
this one &apos;s paolo &apos;s .
rachel , can we talk for a sec ?
well , sure .
just for a sec , paolo &apos;s on his way .
we haven &apos;t known each other that long .
there are three things you should know :
one , my friends are the most important thing in my life .
two , i never lie .
and three , i make the best oatmeal raisin cookies in the world .
okay . thanks , pheebs .
oh , my god !
i know .
why have i never tasted these ?
i don &apos;t make them a lot , because it &apos;s not fair to the other cookies .
these are the best oatmeal raisin cookies .
which proves that i never lie .
i guess you don &apos;t .
paolo made a pass at me .
what do you think ?
it &apos;s the most beautiful table i &apos;ve seen .
i know .
will you balance plates on these heads ?
who cares ? we &apos;ll eat at the sink . come on !
heads up , ross .
score ! you suck !
are you okay ?
i need some mik .
okay . i &apos;ve got milk .
here you go .
better ?
no .
i feel so stupid ! i think about the other day with you guys .
and i was all , &quot; oh , paolo ! he &apos;s so great !
he makes me feel so &quot;
god !
i &apos; m so embarrassed !
i &apos; m so embarrassed .
l &apos; m the one he hit on .
i unleashed him on you .
if i had never met him
l &apos; m so sorry .
no , l &apos; m sorry .
l &apos; m sorry .
l &apos; m sorry . wait .
what are we sorry about ?
i don &apos;t know .
right . he &apos;s the pig .
such a pig !
oh , god , he &apos;s such a pig !
he &apos;s like a big disgusting pig ....
pig man !
yes , good !
but he was my pig man !
how did i not see this ?
oh , i know !
because ...
... he &apos;s gorgeous .
and he &apos;s charming .
and when he looks
okay , pheebs .
the end .
god .
should i not have told you ?
t rust me , it &apos;s much better that i know .
but i just liked it better before . it was better .
she took it pretty well . paolo &apos;s over there now , so ....
we should go and see if she &apos;s okay . just one second .
score !
game ! nice !
come on , pheebs .
well , it looks like we kicked your butts .
she did . you could be on the olympic &quot; standing there &quot; team .
come on . two on one .
why are you here ? she just broke up with him .
it &apos;s time for you to swoop in .
what , now ?
yes . now is when you swoop .
when paolo walks out , you gotta be the first guy she sees .
she &apos;s gotta know you &apos; re everything he &apos;s not . you &apos; re the anti @-@ paolo .
my catholic friend is right .
she &apos;s distraught . you &apos; re there for her .
you pick up the pieces and then you usher in &quot; the age of ross . &quot;
see this ? see ?
hold it ! ascolta !
how &apos;s it going ?
don &apos;t stare .
she threw his clothes off the balcony . now there &apos;s gesturing and arm @-@ waving .
that is , &quot; how could you ? &quot; or &quot; enormous breasts ! &quot;
here he comes .
i am ...
... to say goodbye .
okay , bye @-@ bye .
paolo , i really hate you for what you did , but i still have five of these ...
... so heat it at 375 until the cheese bubbles .
i just wanna tell you , and i think i &apos;d speak for everyone when i say ....
oh , just look at her .
guys , i think only one of us should go ...
... so she &apos;s not overwhelmed .
right .
and i really think it should be me .
you all right ?
i &apos;ve been better .
i don &apos;t believe this .
i wasn &apos;t supposed to care about this guy .
it was just supposed to be this big , fun , ltalian thing .
someday i could look back and say , &quot; that was a big , fun , ltalian thing . &quot;
it wasn &apos;t supposed to feel like this when it was over .
come here .
listen ...
... you deserve so much better than him .
i mean , you ...
... should be with a guy who knows what he has when he has you .
what ?
i &apos; m so sick of guys !
i don &apos;t want to look at or think about another guy .
i don &apos;t even want to be near another guy .
ross , you &apos; re so great .
are you all right ?
are you okay ?
medium . any cookies left ?
yeah .
see , rach ...
... i don &apos;t think swearing off guys altogether is the answer .
what you need is to develop a more sophisticated screening process .
i just need to be by myself for a while .
i just gotta figure out what i want .
no , no .
see , because not all guys out there are gonna be a paolo .
no , i know . i know .
and l &apos; m sure your little boy &apos;s not gonna grow up to be one .
what ?
what ?
i &apos; m having a boy ?
no .
no . in fact , you &apos; re not having a boy .
i &apos; m having a boy .
huh ? am i having a boy ?
you &apos; re having a boy !
i &apos; m having a boy !
l &apos; m having a boy !
what is it ?
i &apos; m having a boy ! i &apos; m having a boy !
we already knew that !
i &apos; m having a son .
yes ! and that would be a shutdown !
shutout !
where you going ? one more game !
it &apos;s 2 : 30 in the morning .
yeah , get out !
you guys always hang out in my apartment .
i &apos;ll only use my left hand .
come on , wussies !
all right ! okay ! i gotta go !
i &apos; m going .
and l &apos; m gone .
