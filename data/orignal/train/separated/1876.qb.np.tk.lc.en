happy valentine &apos;s day .
okay , baby . there we go .
well , listen , i can babysit tonight
if you guys need some time to ... yourselves .
&apos;cause i have , uh , no plans &apos; cause my life is empty .
i &apos;m alone with no plans whatsoever , at all .
that &apos;s great .
so did you , um , did you make a reservation
somewhere beautiful with lots of flickery candles ?
i made a plan . i think you &apos;ll like it .
you should pack a bag .
oh , wow .
overnight ? oh , gosh . well , what about sofia ?
mark got a sitter .
he &apos;ll be home at 11 : 00 , and then he &apos;s got her .
all right . well , what should i bring ?
um , a bathing suit ?
or i don &apos;t know , what are we talking here ?
uh , no bathing suit . boots wouldn &apos;t hurt .
all right . so ... cold .
could be .
wouldn &apos;t hurt to bring long underwear ,
extra fleece .
yeah . hey , don &apos;t make that face .
no .
it will be fun .
yeah . romantic .
there are times in our lives
when love really does conquer all--
exhaustion ...
sleep deprivation ...
anything .
and then there are those times
when it seems like love brings us nothing ...
but pain .
uh , tonight is still gonna work out , right ?
of course it is . we have a plan .
i &apos;m just saying ...
here you go .
you cancel a lot ,
because of the scalpels and cutting people open .
look , i was promised an elegant dinner .
i rearranged my whole schedule .
i &apos;ve got high heels in the back of my car .
i &apos;m gonna spend all day thinking about &apos; em .
is it camping ?
i mean , does she think i &apos;m going camping
on valentine &apos;s day ?
i don &apos;t know .
well , she &apos;s trying to surprise me . i &apos;m telling you ,
the surprise is gonna be ,
i &apos;m gonna leave her on the side of a mountain .
i mean , do you think camping is sexy ?
it &apos;s not sexy .
you can &apos;t take a baby camping .
sofia &apos;s gonna hate it .
what d--y @-@ you &apos;re getting a sitter .
callie said you &apos;re getting a sitter .
yeah , callie also said you were going camping .
callie &apos;s lost her mind .
thank you .
really , it &apos;s camping ?
i don &apos;t know , but it &apos;s your night with sofia .
ugh . well , i need to have sex with my wife ,
apparently in the woods on cold , hard ground .
and you promised callie a sitter , so get a sitter .
come on . this thing with julia is young and fragile .
there &apos;s a lot of pressure .
i got us a table at campo &apos;s .
well , then you better find a sitter .
i have plans .
yep . i got a hot date .
our--our thing is-- is young and fragile , too .
we &apos;re gonna get a zillion valen @-@ traumas .
i bet a few of them will be good surgeries for our boards .
well , it &apos;s not st. patrick &apos;s day .
those are good traumas--
car crashes , bar brawls .
yeah .
yeah , valentine &apos;s day is all swallowed engagement rings
and guys who threw out their backs getting laid .
you &apos;re just bitter &apos; cause you don &apos;t have a date .
first of all , valentine &apos;s day isn &apos;t for
having a date with some chick .
no , it &apos;s for macking the chicks who don &apos;t have dates .
besides , i have to study for my boards .
you studying already ?
of course . you &apos;re not ?
no , i am .
who put up all this ?
i did .
well , research shows that a cheerful environment
reduces stress and helps patients to feel more ...
okay .
i have to get that baby out of my bed .
she &apos;s ruining my sex life .
yeah , well , mine &apos;s already dead .
he &apos;s gonna leave me .
he won &apos;t .
yeah , he will . he is .
i mean , i know it . and you know what ?
i don &apos;t care .
you know , if he wants to leave ,
if he wants to hate me ,
then fine . i can &apos;t make someone stay .
well , you could kinda beg him to stay .
oh , i &apos;m busy .
i &apos;m focused . i &apos;m a surgeon .
well , everyone &apos;s a surgeon . that doesn &apos;t mean--
it does . for me , it does .
i &apos;m brilliant . i &apos;m gifted .
i @-@ i don &apos;t beg .
you know , if he wants to go , then fine . i &apos;m good .
hey , have you guys started studying for your boards ?
yeah .
yeah . why ?
yeah . cool . me--me , too .
i need labs in bed six .
about time , grey . bed three .
okay .
well , anything for me ?
six weeks of headaches , like blinding .
we were in here last week .
they did a brain scan ,
but they didn &apos;t find anything .
said it was probably a migraine ,
but the pills don &apos;t help at all .
janell , can you rate your pain for me
on a scale of 1 to 10 ?
uh , this morning , it was , like , an 11 .
but now it &apos;s more like a ...
janell ?
honey ?
janell ? can you hear me ?
does this happen a lot ?
yeah . she just shuts down
&apos;cause the pain &apos;s too much or something .
uh , we need an e.e.g. over here .
and let &apos;s page shepherd . quickly , please .
right away .
this isn &apos;t a migraine , right ?
no , it &apos;s not a migraine .
she &apos;s having a seizure .
i have been off of
dr. altman &apos;s service now for two weeks .
i stepped over a line . you reprimanded me .
continuing to punish me is--
fine .
you &apos;re on her service .
get down !
watch out !
what was that ? !
is everybody okay ? !
are you okay ?
yes .
you sure ?
yes .
i don &apos;t know what happened ! i just walked in here !
airway seems fine , but he &apos;s got some j.v.d.
he &apos;s tachycardic with muffled heart sounds .
what happened ?
sir , you &apos;re at seattle grace mercy west hospital .
your van crashed .
no one was hurt , but we need to get you examined .
come on .
i must have fallen asleep at the wheel for a second .
i &apos;ve been working like a dog all week .
oh , god . no , no , no . i @-@ i gotta go . i--
sir , relax , relax . just lie down .
no , i have to go . i &apos;m a florist .
these roses won &apos;t last in the open air . they &apos;re gonna wilt .
sir , you need to calm down .
we &apos;re gonna get you out of here .
maintain in @-@ line stabilization .
we need to get trauma labs , films , and ultrasound .
make sure that c.t. is available ,
and page altman .
right away , doctor .
she &apos;s not responding to the seizure medication , randy .
she is in serious danger of suffering severe brain damage ,
which is why i &apos;d like to place her
in a medically induced coma .
a @-@ a coma ? what do you mean ?
basically , a deep sleep to prevent
the seizures from damaging her brain .
it will also buy us some time
so we can figure out what &apos;s causing them .
she just turned 32 .
we &apos;ve never talked about medical decision @-@ type stuff .
well , every seizure janell has
hurts her brain a little bit more .
we need to do this now .
oh , god . yeah . please do it .
okay .
do it , please .
push 150 milligrams of propofol .
call respiratory while i prep for intubation .
kepner , forget the flowers .
throw them out and get back to work .
we &apos;ve got more people coming in .
kepner .
you &apos;re not throwing those flowers away ?
but--but he--
he doesn &apos;t need to know .
throwing away perfectly good flowers .
everyone &apos;s a cynic these days ...
talking about not believing in valentine &apos;s day .
i mean , what &apos;s wrong with a day
devoted to the person you love ?
i take this day very seriously .
i know you do . happy anniversary , sir .
mm . thank you , dr. grey .
i &apos;m heading home early ,
try and spend most of the day with my wife .
w @-@ what about you ? you hitting the town ?
i &apos;m not hitting much of anything these days .
oh , god . i &apos;m sorry .
that was crass .
i &apos;m h--uh , uh , have no valentine &apos;s plans .
what the hell was i thinking ?
i should &apos;ve listened to my mom .
i used to be young ! i used to be pretty !
i have wasted my entire youth on you !
charlie bilson , 32 , hit by a car
when he ran head @-@ on into traffic .
complains of chest and back pain .
i thought it would happen ! how stupid could i be ?
has abdominal tenderness on palpation .
how stupid ? !
and it looks like a broken nose .
i cannot believe you did this !
okay , if you hadn &apos;t made me chase you down--
you should not have chased me .
you shouldn &apos;t have bothered ,
because it &apos;s over .
this is over .
what happened ?
we &apos;re having breakfast in bed .
one second , you &apos;re so happy--
i thought you were going to propose !
well , what do you think ?
well , she &apos;s wheezing , but we &apos;ll treat that .
you &apos;re gonna be just fine , uh ...
clementine . uh , i think the kids call her clem .
you &apos;re not the mom ?
she &apos;s on her way . she was at the gym .
i &apos;m just the moron that bought the box of peanut clusters
for the kid who &apos;s allergic to nuts .
my son wanted to give her a valentine .
she took a bite , and this happened .
i &apos;m--i &apos;m gonna start you on a breathing treatment .
and then i &apos;m gonna give you an i.v. with medicine
to treat the rash , okay ?
okay . all right .
here .
if it hurts , you can squeeze my hand ,
hard as you want .
okay , clem , here we go .
ready ?
one , two ...
three . okay .
good .
honestly , those little boxes ?
they taunt me , charlie .
i would rather a nice coffee table book
or maybe even a mug ,
because then at least i wouldn &apos;t get my hopes up
every freakin &apos; valentine &apos;s day
when you pull out the little velvet box .
you didn &apos;t even look at the necklace .
i didn &apos;t have to . it wasn &apos;t a ring .
oh , that &apos;s a ...
pretty nasty cut there .
dr. grey .
you want to take a look ?
sure .
come with me .
a man should get to bleed in peace .
thanks .
what ?
mm . i was trying to figure out
why this patient &apos;s having seizures
when i noticed she has a hemolytic anemia .
uh , which means she &apos;s having an autoimmune response .
right . if antibodies are attacking her red blood cells ,
who &apos;s to say that antibodies couldn &apos;t be attacking her brain ,
causing the encephalitis ?
oh , and it &apos;s not a brain tumor .
that &apos;s why you paged me .
well , yeah , and i thought we could spend
valentine &apos;s day together .
uh , you may not have valentine &apos;s day plans ,
but i do , grey ,
plans that i am not willing to forfeit .
so here &apos;s how this is going to go--
in a timely and efficient manner ,
you and i will rule out everything that could be
causing this woman &apos;s body to attack itself ,
virus by virus , tumor by tumor ,
until we land on the one thing--
it &apos;s a teratoma .
what ?
i sent off janell &apos;s csf from her spinal tap
for anti @-@ nmda receptor antibodies ,
and it just came back positive .
show off .
let &apos;s get a scan .
is this our flower guy ?
yeah . he has aintrapericardial diaphragmatic hernia .
whoa . how did his abdominal organs
get into the sac around his heart ?
uh , his chest hit the wheel when he crashed .
well , i &apos;m gonna have to reduce the hernia .
book an or .
bump any nonemergent patients ,
and find someone to scrub in with me .
dr. hunt has agreed to let me back on your service ,
so i can scrub in with you .
really ?
we need to get in there and do the repair
before he tamponades ,
so we should move as quickly as possible .
like i &apos;m ever anything but .
you must think i &apos;m such a bitch .
no .
it &apos;s been eight years .
and it &apos;s--it &apos;s-- every valentine &apos;s day ,
the buildup gets worse .
this morning he wakes me up , and breakfast in bed ,
and then he tells me , he booked dinner
and a nice hotel at the pier ,
and then he pulls out another cheap ass necklace .
eight years .
we &apos;re not exactly teenagers .
maybe he doesn &apos;t know how much you want it .
we go to 20 weddings a year ,
and i sob like a lunatic at every one .
i &apos;m not that sentimental .
he knows .
he knows .
c.t. shows extensive internal bleeding .
he &apos;s also hypotensive .
we have to get him up to the o.r. now .
what--what &apos;s going on ? what &apos;s happening ?
we &apos;re taking your fiance to surgery .
he is not her fiance .
suction .
watch the ...
oh , sorry . sorry .
so anybody got any good valentine &apos;s plans ?
my husband died
in this o.r. a month ago .
dr. yang performed the surgery .
i was in a 7 @-@ hour surgery
and didn &apos;t know that he had died .
dr. hunt kept that a secret .
so i don &apos;t speak to him .
he wants a baby .
dr. yang doesn &apos;t .
so they don &apos;t speak to each other
even though they &apos;re married .
so ...
no .
how about you ?
my girlfriend and i are gonna ...
nothing .
nothing .
we think this thing on janell &apos;s lung
is something called a teratoma .
it &apos;s creating antibodies that are attacking her brain .
well , i don &apos;t get it .
basically , her body sees the tumor as an invader
and is attacking it ,
and her brain is getting hurt in the crossfire .
so this thing on her lung is causing her seizures ?
i think so .
we &apos;ll have to remove it and test it to make sure .
o @-@ okay , so you take it out , her headaches stop ,
and she wakes up from the coma ,
and we get to go on to live our lives ?
that &apos;s the plan .
okay .
we &apos;ve known each other since high school .
she &apos;s my better half .
i mean , i know people always say that ...
but she really is .
you paged me for this ?
why would i do this ?
because it &apos;s fair .
because the three of us are equal parents to sofia
and this is the fair way to decide who stays in with her .
unless you &apos;d rather raise her
with no sense of fairness or decency ...
in anarchy and chaos .
your call .
okay . fine .
best two out of three ?
best two out of three .
you ready ?
rock , paper , scissors .
rock , paper , scissors .
my rock !
crushes your scissors .
rock--hold on , hold on . time @-@ out .
time @-@ out ? i &apos;m sorry , time @-@ o--time @-@ out ?
jackson , team huddle .
oh , my gosh . are you guys kidding me ?
i mean , some of us have surgeries .
can you just give us a second ?
what do you think ?
i think she &apos;s going paper .
she &apos;s going with rocks .
i &apos;m thinking she &apos;s a rock thrower .
yeah , that &apos;s what she wants you to think . all right ?
that &apos;s why she did it two times in a row .
this time , trust me ... go scissors .
okay , you guys , it &apos;s not a chess game .
can we just-- can we do this ?
get out there .
all right .
here we go .
rock , paper , scissors .
no !
oh , yes !
damn it !
i &apos;m getting lucky tonight . happy babysitting .
see you later .
all right .
avery , i said rocks .
my gut told me rocks .
you messed with my head .
you asked my opinion .
julia &apos;s gonna kill me .
she &apos;s having a severe reaction . sorry , clem .
it looks like we &apos;re gonna have to give you a shot .
hand ?
yes , please .
excuse me .
oh , i &apos;m sorry .
oh , clem .
oh , honey .
you poor thing .
hi , mom .
she &apos;s gonna be fine .
the doctor &apos;s gonna give her a shot .
he &apos;s on top of it .
well , i &apos;m glad someone is .
i didn &apos;t know .
the school sends home notes all the time .
it &apos;s in every newsletter .
she can &apos;t even be near peanut butter .
i have a job , terri , okay ? three kids .
excuse me if i don &apos;t read every note the school sends home .
i gave her a shot of epinephrine .
it should do the trick .
he &apos;s hypothermic .
yeah . there &apos;s too much bleeding .
he &apos;s not gonna make it if we keep going .
let &apos;s pack him and get him up to i.c.u.
to stabilize him .
i am not babysitting .
i have made your career ,
and i can break it .
i need to check for a septal hematoma .
i &apos;ll be quick . i got a date tonight .
what makes you think i could babysit ?
well , you know c.p.r. , you can think on your feet ,
you &apos;re fit ,
you can run out of a burning building in no time .
septum looks fine .
and i &apos;m not gonna cancel a date on valentine &apos;s day .
women claim that they don &apos;t care , but they all do ,
a lot .
okay , uh , let &apos;s prep him for i.c.u.
and i &apos;ll -- i &apos;ll stay and monitor him .
no , it &apos;s your anniversary . i &apos;ll stay .
i thought you had a hot date .
really ? with who ?
uh , dr. sloan , i mean ,
if you &apos;re finished here , we &apos;d like to --
oh , i &apos;ll tell you who &apos;s finished .
you &apos;re finished .
thank you .
i already pressed it .
whatever .
i &apos;m moving out .
so if you need me , i &apos;ll be at my mom &apos;s
till i , uh ...
figure something out .
okay ?
okay .
hey , i got your message your lung resection went long .
i pushed our reservations to 8 : 00 .
really ? just like that on valentine &apos;s day ?
i got connections .
i could even push &apos; em to 9 : 00 if you like .
no . absolutely not . no .
as soon as path confirms
that the mass we took out was the teratoma ,
i will go out to my car ,
grab those heels ...
benign granuloma .
all right , fine .
push the reservation to 9 : 00 .
why are you still here ? you can go .
i &apos;d love to . i &apos;d love nothing more .
but nico won &apos;t leave until he knows clem &apos;s gonna be okay .
he &apos;s 10 . who &apos;s the parent here ?
you let that kid run wild .
at least i don &apos;t hover over him ,
afraid to let him out of my sight .
well , maybe i need to hover
because you and your son won &apos;t leave us alone .
what were you thinking , dropping him
at my house today when i wasn &apos;t home ?
he wasn &apos;t gonna stay .
he just wanted to give your spoiled daughter
a box of freakin &apos; chocolates .
well , stop giving us things .
we barely survived the head lice he gave her .
you have no way of knowing who gave who the head lice .
okay , that &apos;s enough .
they &apos;re 10 . they &apos;re in love . they &apos;re cute .
let them be cute , for crying out loud .
excuse me , doctor , something &apos;s wrong with clem .
she &apos;s breathing funny .
get me a size 6 e.t. tube .
what &apos;s happening ?
her airway is shutting down .
i &apos;m gonna have to intubate .
oh , my god .
here you go .
give me some crike pressure .
all right .
i &apos;m in .
all right .
there &apos;s good color change .
sat &apos;s are coming up .
what happened ?
anaphylactic shock .
we &apos;re gonna have to keep her overnight
and see how she responds .
but -- but she &apos;s gonna be okay ?
yeah , yeah , i think so .
now will you go ?
please .
it doesn &apos;t make any sense .
janell &apos;s labs show she has a teratoma .
then the lucky woman has two tumors --
the benign one that we just took out of her lung
and another one --
where ?
her scans and her ultrasound are clean .
what if it &apos;s microscopic ?
okay , um ...
what do we know about n.m.d.a ?
receptor teratomas ?
we know they &apos;re most commonly found
on the ovaries .
you want to take out her ovaries ?
she &apos;s 32 years old .
they &apos;re always 32 and nice and undeserving .
these kind of things don &apos;t happen to nasty people .
his vitals are holding .
that &apos;s good .
mm . his pupils are a little sluggish .
sharon , are you okay ?
can i get you anything ?
i had a ring picked out .
i sent a picture of it
to all of my sisters .
so , uh , they could help charlie surprise me
when the time came ,
&apos;cause that ring was important .
it was so freaking important .
look at him .
he looks--he &apos;s ... he looks ...
i don &apos;t care about that crap anymore .
and i don &apos;t need a stupid ring .
i just ...
i just need him .
that &apos;s it . i just want him to be okay .
please . just let him be okay .
your incision looks good .
you should be back on your feet in a few weeks ,
but i wouldn &apos;t recommend pulling any more all @-@ nighters ,
even on holidays like today .
oh , trust me , brother . i &apos;m done .
i mean , what a stupid business .
people call you up . you know ,
they ask you to make something beautiful .
yeah , so some sorry schlep can forget that
they &apos;ve been treated like crap every other day of the year .
yeah , like my flowers are magic or something .
but i bought it .
nearly killed myself trying to make sure
everybody got their little miracle .
what a joke .
people oughta just stop being so awful to each other ,
you know ?
leave me out of it .
dr. yang will check on you later .
thank you .
thank you .
can i just talk to you for a minute ?
i know you &apos;ve been through hell ,
and i know i was part of it .
and i know you &apos;re grieving ,
and there &apos;s no magic solution to that , but ...
we used to be friends .
and i really ...
really need a friend today .
so how about we just go across the street to joe &apos;s ,
and i &apos;ll buy you a drink , you know ?
or i will buy you many , many drinks .
are you done ?
are you finished ?
yes .
i hate you .
from the moment you decided to put the needs of your hospital
over my dead husband , i have hated you .
i lie in bed at night alone ,
and i look at the spot where my husband used to sleep ,
and i actively ,
with every cell in my body , hate you .
i wish you were dead instead of him .
i think about all the soldiers , good men ,
who died over there in iraq ,
and i don &apos;t understand what kind of god
would allow you to survive .
we are not friends .
this is not grief . it will not pass .
i hate you !
please ... don &apos;t speak to me again
unless it &apos;s work related .
l @-@ l @-@ let me-- let me get this straight .
all right , you--you take this thing out of her lungs ,
and it &apos;s not what you thought it was .
now you want to take out her ovaries .
the kind of antibodies that she had
are most commonly associated with teratomas of the ovaries .
but they can sometimes be found in other places ,
which is why we thought the mass on her lung was it .
chances are high that it &apos;s on her ovaries .
chances are ?
that &apos;s the best you can do ?
she &apos;s young .
she still wants kids . we ...
no .
you &apos;re doctors .
you &apos;re gonna have to do a hell of a lot better
than &quot; chances are . &quot;
if we do nothing ,
she will continue to have the seizures .
and eventually , her body will just completely shut down .
and by that time , she will have suffered
so much brain damage .
that janell , the woman that you love , she &apos;ll be gone .
the nougats are gone . sorry .
did you get these from a patient ?
no .
i bought these for julia , but ...
she &apos;s standing me up
for an emergency ocular transplant surgery , so ...
mm . i &apos;m gorging myself on valentine &apos;s chocolate .
mm . i &apos;d mock you right now
if my mouth wasn &apos;t so full .
try the square ones .
they &apos;re caramel with sea salt .
i didn &apos;t want to disappoint her .
you know , i bought candy and flowers .
i got rose petals , lex .
bags of &apos; em .
i was looking forward to sharing it .
but now i &apos;m alone on valentine &apos;s day ...
eating chocolate .
i can do you one better .
my hot date tonight ?
zola .
i am babysitting .
let &apos;s move ! he &apos;s coding ! he &apos;s crashing .
what is that ? what &apos;s happening ?
what are you ... what are you doing ?
can someone please tell me what is happening ?
sharon ...
he was just fine one second ago .
no , you need to go . now !
what &apos;s happening ?
somebody page dr. webber . taking over compressions .
he &apos;s in v @-@ fib .
push an amp of epi and charge the paddles to 360 .
is it loaded ?
okay . yep , we &apos;re doing it .
clear .
he &apos;s hemorrhaging . probably in d.i.c.
okay , charge again . go .
hang some f.f.p. and factor vii .
clear .
oh , god . no .
i &apos;m so sorry .
his heart stopped . we tried to revive him ,
but despite our best efforts , he didn &apos;t make it .
he died at 7 : 53 p.m.
no indication of a tumor .
it could be microscopic .
there &apos;s a lot of adhesions on this one ,
that could mean inflammation .
which could mean a teratoma .
so let &apos;s take out the right ovary ,
send it to path , and try to save the left one .
dr. grey , i &apos;m the g.y.n.
i really should be the one ...
okay , but you &apos;re a third year ,

he actually thinks that we can just forget
everything that happened .
i don &apos;t even know how to ...
how can he think that we would ever ,
ever be friends again ?
standing over me
is not gonna make me read it any faster .
this part of the specimen is a little abnormal ,
but until i look at a couple more slides ...
move over .
no .
move ... over .
oh , fine .
dr. bailey , see what i see ?
i haven &apos;t confirmed it yet .
a mix of different cell types ,
which is compatible with teratomas .

i &apos;m not great at surprises .
i @-@ i @-@ i wish i was ,
but i know we &apos;re camping .
mm @-@ hmm . you know , i &apos;m pretty sure that
we &apos;re smack @-@ dab in the center
of one of washington &apos;s fine national parks ,
and i &apos;m trying--i &apos;m trying to have a good attitude ,
but this whole blind thing is just not helping matters .

no one &apos;s around for miles .
our patient &apos;s seizures stopped ,
and you know why ?
no .
because i found this teratoma on her ovary .
well , you know , you could &apos;ve told me this at dinner .
you didn &apos;t have to show me a chopped up ovary .
little sucker thought it could hide from me , but it couldn &apos;t .
it took a while ,
but i finally figured out where it was ,
and i went in and nailed it .
you are so sexy when you &apos;re looking at a teratoma .
yeah ?
grade five ?
uh , ruptured ?
yeah , send him over .
blunt trauma to the kidney .
guy crashed into a pole ,
not only shattering his kidney and his renal artery ,
but ruining my valentine &apos;s day .

just go . get home . oh , and it &apos;s your anniversary .
oh , for god sake . a @-@ adele &apos;s probably so angry at you--
i just went home .
she didn &apos;t recognize me .
she thought i looked like a nice guy
and invited me to join her for dinner ,
uh , flirted with me over steaks ,
thought i had a nice smile .
so , no , dr. bailey ,
my wife &apos;s not mad right now .
in fact , i think she &apos;s falling in love with me .
sir ...
i &apos;m so sorry .
yeah , go . go .
i &apos;d like to be alone right now
with a kidney and a scalpel .

and if there is a , uh , ch--
no , i &apos;m not gonna tell him .
no , i &apos;m gonna-- of course ...
ugh ! okay , of course . no , i &apos;m gonna tell him
because if you don &apos;t say anything ,
then you--you bleed out and die
and then read about it in a plastic locket .
i mean , what--what do-- what do you think ?
what should i do ?
zola ?
tell me .
oh , look . oh , hey , hi .

it &apos;s--it &apos;s 11 : 23 p.m ..
you blew me off for dinner hours ago .
i ruined our valentine &apos;s day ?
miranda , i--
i &apos;m a terrible person .
i @-@ i know . i don &apos;t make time like i should .
uh , i &apos;m not good at , you know , romance @-@ y ... things ,
but , look , i am working ,
and you can &apos;t fault me for that .
you can &apos;t fault me for saving lives .
and if--if you &apos;re going to break up with me
for missing a dinner because i was saving a life ,
then , you know , i don &apos;t even want
to have romance @-@ y things with you--
okay , miran @-@ miranda .
wait . why are you in a suit ?
because it &apos;s 11 : 23 p.m ..
valentine &apos;s day isn &apos;t over yet .
you threw this together today ?
oh , no . no , no , no , no , no .
i &apos;ve been planning this for weeks .
see , i knew there was no chance in hell
that we &apos;d make a scheduled reservation .
so , uh , i booked marco here .
i mean , i &apos;m dating dr. bailey .
i know the drill .
i know you .
you know me .
oh , and , uh , i even had marco
put extra crumb topping on your mac and cheese .
i know you .
okay .
thank you , sir .
miranda .
i happen to be very good
at romance @-@ y things .
you are .
we &apos;re always looking for ways to ease the pain .
i thought maybe the , uh , the girls
could have a play date .
and , um , we could , uh , uh , to talk ,
you know , about stuff ,
&apos;cause there &apos;s some stuff
that i &apos;ve been wanting to say .
is that julia ?
i &apos;ll--i &apos;ll go .
avery &apos;s cooking me dinner .
is that julia ? &apos; cause i can go .
oh . that &apos;s ...
but he can go ...
if you want to talk .
should he go ?
nope .
it &apos;s nothing . i--you-- i &apos;m ju--
i &apos;m gonna--it &apos;s-- you know what ?
you two have a very pleasant evening .
don &apos;t be stupid . you love steak .
sofia , your friend &apos;s here .
sometimes we ease the pain
by making the best of what we have .
sometimes it &apos;s by losing ourselves in the moment .
please .
don &apos;t hate me .
i &apos;m begging you .
and sometimes all we need to do to ease the pain ...
is call a simple truce .
