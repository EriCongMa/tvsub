there is a town in maine ...
i &apos;d like a room .
welcome to storybrooke .
where every storybook character you &apos;ve ever known ...
is trapped between two worlds ...
an evil queen sent a bunch of fairy tale characters here .
and now they don &apos;t remember who they are .
victims of a powerful curse ...
everything you love , everything all of you love ,
will be taken from you .
only one knows the truth ,
and only one can break her spell .
it &apos;s your destiny .
you &apos;re gonna bring back the happy endings .
you enjoy your stay .
what do you think of the view , my dear ?
i &apos;ve seen better .
this is taking forever .
i told you the troll road would &apos;ve been quicker .
and far less bumpy .
are you even listening to me ?
yes , of course i am .
now what ?
m &apos;lord !
worry not . it &apos;s but a fallen tree .
fellows , shall we ?
m &apos;lord ... what is it ?
look at these markings .
this tree didn &apos;t fall . it &apos;s been cut .
it &apos;s an ambush .
help me !
show your face , you coward !
you &apos;re a ...
girl .
woman .
you can &apos;t hide from me !
wherever you are , i will find you !
um , where were we ?
uh , something about you wanting 15 kids ?
oh , good lord , no .
i meant in my class , where i teach .
you &apos;ll meet them tomorrow . they &apos;re coming to the hospital
as part of the volunteer outreach program .
oh , yeah , that is a great program .
i mean , obviously i don &apos;t want 15 kids of my own .
i @-@ i mean , not that i don &apos;t want kids . i do .
i want kids , marriage , true love .
i want it all , but that , of course , is ...
wildly inappropriate for me to discuss on a first date .
ruby ?
yes , mary margaret ?
check , please .
hey . you okay ?
oh , in the world of tight spots i &apos;ve been in ,
crashing in my car doesn &apos;t even rank in the top ten .
you &apos;re sleeping here ?
till i find a place .
you decided to stay .
for henry .
yeah . i guess .
this town doesn &apos;t seem to have many vacancies .
none , actually .
is that normal ?
must be the curse .
why are you out so late ?
well , i &apos;m a teacher , not a nun .
i had a date .
from the looks of things , it went well .
as well as they ever do .
tell me he at least paid .
guess if true love was easy , we &apos;d all have it .
you know , if things get cramped ,
i do have a spare room .
thanks .
i &apos;m not ... really the roommate type .
it &apos;s just not my thing .
i do better on my own .
well ... good night . good luck with henry .
yeah .
henry .
we could really use your help with the decorations .
is mr. doe gonna be okay , ms. blanchard ?
his name &apos;s not john doe , honey .
that &apos;s just what they call people
when they don &apos;t know who they are .
do you know who he is ?
no . i just bring him flowers on my rounds .
what &apos;s wrong with him ?
i don &apos;t know .
he &apos;s been like this as long as i &apos;ve been volunteering .
does he have any family or friends ?
no one &apos;s claimed him .
so ... he &apos;s all alone ?
yeah .
it &apos;s quite sad .
you sure you don &apos;t know him ?
of course i &apos;m sure .
come on . you shouldn &apos;t be in here .
i found your father--
prince charming .
henry ...
he &apos;s in the hospital , in a coma .
see the scar ?
he has one , too .
so ? lots of people have scars .
in the same place .
don &apos;t you see what this means ?
the curse is keeping them apart with the coma .
now they &apos;re stuck without each other .
we have to tell ms. blanchard
we found her prince charming .
okay , kid . telling someone their ...
soulmate is in a coma is probably not helpful .
not having a happy ending is painful enough ,
but ... giving someone unrealistic hope is far worse .
but what if i &apos;m right ?
we know who they are .
now they have to know .
and how do you intend to make that happen ?
by reminding him .
we have to get her to read their story to john doe ,
then maybe he &apos;ll remember who he is .
okay .
okay ?
yeah .
we &apos;ll do it , but we &apos;ll do it my way .
let me ask her .
you want me to read to a coma patient ?
henry thinks it will help him remember who he was .
and who does he think he was ?
prince charming .
and if i &apos;m snow white ,
he thinks ... me ... and him .
he has a very active imagination ,
which is the point .
i can &apos;t talk him out of his beliefs ,
so we need to show him .
play along .
do what he says , and then maybe , just maybe
he &apos;ll see that fairy tales are just that .
that there &apos;s no such thing as love at first sight
or first kiss .
he &apos;ll see reality .
something like that .
sadly , this plan is rather genius .
we get him to the truth without hurting him .
i told him that we will all meet tomorrow
for breakfast at granny &apos;s ,
and you will give a full report .
well , i suppose i &apos;ll get ready for my date .
i guess i &apos;ll have to do all the talking .
look , i know this is odd ,
but i &apos;m doing it for a friend .
so please just bear with me .
&quot; as the prince chased the thief on horseback
through the treacherous forest ,
his betrothed crossed her arms and pouted ,
wondering how many dreadful , boring minutes it would take
before they could resume their journey again .
the thief vaulted over a fallen ...
... they didn &apos;t need words to express what they felt in their hearts ,
for it was here , in the shadow of the troll bridge ,
that their love was born ,
where they knew , no matter how they were separated ,
they would always-- &quot;
yeah , i &apos;m sure . he &apos;s waking up .
and he--he grabbed my hand .
everything &apos;s steady ,
same as it &apos;s always been .
what were you doing in here ?
oh , i was just reading h @-@ him a ... story .
oh . well , perhaps you dozed off .
perhaps you imagined it .
no , i didn &apos;t imagine anything .
ms. blanchard , i can only tell you what i see ,
which is nothing .
sometimes there are minor fluctuations in readings .
uh , perhaps you heard the machine register something
and misunderstood .
look , why don &apos;t you go home , get some rest ?
if anything changes , i &apos;ll call you , okay ?
yes ?
it &apos;s dr. whale .
you told me to call you if there was ever a change in our john doe .
something &apos;s happened .
what ?
one of our volunteers said he grabbed her .
there was a slight fluctuation in brain activity .
and who was this volunteer ?
mary margaret blanchard .
i told you i &apos;d find you .
no matter what you do ,
i will always find you .
is this the only way you can catch a woman--
by entrapping her ?
it &apos;s the only way to catch thieving scum .
oh . aren &apos;t you a real prince charming ?
i have a name , you know .
don &apos;t care . &quot; charming &quot; suits you .
now cut me down ... charming .
i &apos;ll release you
when you return the leather pouch you stole with my jewels .
not the jewelry type .
indeed . i noticed .
what is that supposed to mean ? are you insulting me ?
no , quite right . my apologies .
how dare i cast aspersions at the person who robbed me .
where are my jewels ?
i sold them .
what ?
what do you care ?
don &apos;t you have a palace full of treasures somewhere ?
these were special .
among them was a ring that belonged to my mother ,
a ring i was about to give--
the nag with the bad attitude ? that &apos;s what this is about ?
she &apos;s my fiancee .
good luck with that .
you must be getting something impressive
to have agreed to that union .
excuse me ?
i know how this works .
true love ? it doesn &apos;t exist .
it &apos;s all arranged marriages and business transactions .
there &apos;s no such thing as love at first sight
or first kiss .
let me guess .
her kingdom wants to take over yours , and this is--
what , a last @-@ ditch effort to avoid war ?
this is not a takeover .
it--it &apos;s a merger ,
and quite frankly , it &apos;s none of your business .
now this is what &apos;s going to happen .
i &apos;m going to cut you down .
and you will take me to whoever has my jewels ,
and then you &apos;re going to get my ring back .
mm . why would i do that ?
because you don &apos;t want me to tell anyone who you really are .
snow white .
help me get my ring back ,
or i turn you over to the queen &apos;s forces .
and i have a feeling the queen &apos;s not as ...
charming as i am .
i wouldn &apos;t want to stand in the way
of your getting &quot; true love . &quot;
thanks for the shirt . hey , is this your mother &apos;s ?
she &apos;ll never notice .
where does she think you are , anyway ?
playing whac @-@ a @-@ mole .
and she bought that ?
she wants to believe it , so she does .
oh , imagine that .
she &apos;s here .
hey ... don &apos;t get your hopes up .
we &apos;re just getting started , okay ?
he woke up .
what ?
i knew it .
i mean , he didn &apos;t wake up- wake up ,
but he grabbed my hand .
he &apos;s remembering .
what did the doctor say ?
that i imagined it . but i &apos;m not crazy .
i know it happened .
we have to go back .
you have to read to him again .
let &apos;s go .
wait . wait .
what ?
if i got through to him ,
if we made a connection--
you don &apos;t believe--
that he &apos;s prince charming ? of course not .
somehow , someway ,
i touched him .
you &apos;re right . he &apos;s waking up .
henry , you should stay back .
what &apos;s going on ? is it john doe ? is he okay ?
he &apos;s missing .
what the hell are you doing here ?
and you .
i thought you were at the arcade .
now you &apos;re lying to me ?
what happened to john doe ? did someone take him ?
we don &apos;t know yet . his i.v.s were ripped out ,
but there &apos;s no sign for sure there was a struggle .
what did you do ?
you think i had something to do with this ?
it is curious that the mayor is here .
i &apos;m here because i &apos;m his emergency contact .
you know him ?
i found him
on the side of the road years ago with no i.d.
i brought him here .
mayor mills saved his life .
will he be okay ?
okay ?
the man &apos;s been on feeding tubes for years ,
under constant supervision .
he needs to get back here right away , or quite honestly ,
&quot; okay &quot; might be a pipe dream .
well , then let &apos;s quit yapping and start looking .
that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing . just stay out of this , dear .
and since i clearly can &apos;t keep you away from my son ...
i guess i &apos;m just gonna have to keep my son away from you .
enjoy my shirt ,
because that &apos;s all you &apos;re getting .
sheriff ?
find john doe .
you heard dr. whale .
time is precious .
doctor , how long between your rounds
since you last saw him ?
12 hours or so .
then that &apos;s what we need to account for .
you two were the only employees on the floor last night ...
and you saw nothing ?
not a thing .
did anyone walk by ?
i didn &apos;t see nothin &apos; .
ms. blanchard , was there anything unusual you saw
during your trip with your class ?
i don &apos;t think so .
we &apos;re looking at the wrong tape .
this is the ward where henry &apos;s class put up decorations .
if this was really the tape from last night ,
we &apos;d see the banners the kids hung .
you fell asleep again .
you selling me out ?
i ain &apos;t getting fired for this .
at least i don &apos;t drink on the job .
gentlemen , enough .
where &apos;s the real tape ?
oh , he walked out alone . he &apos;s okay .
four hours ago .
where does this door lead ?
the woods .
i thought you weren &apos;t the jewelry type .
what &apos;s that around your neck ?
don &apos;t worry about it .
careful !
it &apos;s a weapon .
dust ? what kind of weapon is dust ?
fairy dust .
i thought that was a good thing .
when it comes from a good fairy .
this stuff is deadly .
it transforms the most fearsome of adversaries
into a form that &apos;s easily squashed .
then why didn &apos;t you use it on me ?
&apos;cause you &apos;re not worth it .
it &apos;s very hard to come by .
i &apos;m saving it for a special someone .
ah , the queen .
you &apos;ve got a lot of anger there , don &apos;t you , snow ?
the charges on her posters are lies .
didn &apos;t stop her from sending her huntsman
to rip out my heart .
what happened ?
well , not everyone is a soulless royal .
he took pity on me and let me go .
i &apos;ve been hiding in the forest ever since ,
trying to amass enough fortune to leave this place ,
escape to another realm--
somewhere isolated , where i can never be hurt .
sounds lonely .
no lonelier than an arranged marriage .
at least i don &apos;t prey on the innocent .
up until now ,
i &apos;ve only ever stolen from the queen .
i thought your carriage was one of hers .
no one else uses that road .
we took the scenic route .
well , lucky for me .
all i &apos;m doing , charming ,
is what it takes to survive .
she wants me dead .
so ... what did you do to incur that much wrath ?
she blames me for ruining her life .
did you ?
yes .
i &apos;m thirsty .
may i ?
sure .
make it quick .
huh . look who we found .
there &apos;s nowhere to hide . the queen wants your heart .
and we &apos;re not going to disappoint her .
what is it ?
the trail runs out here .
you sure ? &apos; cause i thought tracking was one of your skills .
just give me a second . this is my world .
i got it .
right . sorry .
what does he mean , &quot; his world &quot; ?
isn &apos;t finding people your thing , too ?
sure . just ...
people i find usually run to places like vegas .
not a lot hit the woods .
it &apos;s an interesting job-- finding people .
how &apos;d you fall into it ?
looking for people &apos;s just what i &apos;ve done ...
as long as i can remember .
what made you start ?
your parents ?
henry told me that your--
that you were from a similar situation to his own ?
did you ever find them ?
depends who you ask .
henry !
did you find him yet ?
no , not yet . you shouldn &apos;t be here .
i can help . i know where he &apos;s going .
and where &apos;s that ?
he &apos;s looking for you .
hold her still .
ohh ! no !
are you all right ?
you ...
you saved me .
seemed like the honorable thing to do .
are you ready ?
for what ?
my jewels .
right . you &apos;ve got a wedding to get to .
the trolls i sold them to are just beyond the next ridge .
we need to be careful .
what , of trolls ?
you &apos;ve clearly never met one .
aren &apos;t they just little people ?
you &apos;re thinking of dwarves .
show a little respect .
they &apos;ll cut your hand off sooner than they &apos;ll shake it .
well , then let &apos;s get this over with .
yes , we &apos;ve both got places to be .
so let &apos;s go .
you have your lonely little corner of solitude to find ...
and you have a ring @-@ less fiancee to appease .
you &apos;re the one who woke him up .
you &apos;re the last one he saw .
he wants to find you .
henry , it &apos;s not about me . it just--
i think he &apos;s lost and confused .
he &apos;s been in a coma a long time .
but he loves you .
you need to stop chasing him and let him find you .
kid , you need to go home . where &apos;s your mom ?
she &apos;s gonna kill me and then you and then me again .
she dropped me at the house then went right out .
well , we need to get you back immediately .
no !
guys ?
is that ...

i told you . i have a name .
it &apos;s james .
it &apos;s nice to meet you , james .
we should go . there may be more of them coming .
oh , gosh .
where is he ? can you see him ?
the trail dies at the water line .
oh , my god ! oh , my god !
oh , my god !
i need an ambulance at the old toll bridge
as soon as possible .
hang on , hang on . i got him , i got him .
i &apos;m falling .
hold on . i feel it . we need to slow down .
slow down , slow down , slow down .

i don &apos;t know .
it &apos;s okay .
you &apos;re gonna be okay .
watch your backs . coming through .
thanks , guys . we got it from here .
120 over 70 ...
take that .
david ! david , is that you ?
excuse me , ma &apos;am ?
ma &apos;am , you can &apos;t be in here , please .
oh , my god .
you can &apos;t be here right now .
david .
you can &apos;t be here , ma &apos;am .
will you wait over here for a second , okay ?
who is that ?
his wife .
so ...
oh , you probably want this .
right , the gold . thank you .
and , um , you can &apos;t get married without this .
i know . not your style .
well , there &apos;s only one way to find out .
yeah , not me at all .
i &apos;m sure your fiancee will love it .
you know , if you need more , you can have the rest .
the ring is all i require .
oh , no . i &apos;m good , thanks .
we both got what we wanted .
well , wherever you &apos;re going , be careful .
if you need anything ...
you &apos;ll find me .
always .
i almost believe that .
well , good @-@ bye , snow white .
good @-@ bye , prince charming .
i told you , it &apos;s james .
nah . still like &quot; charming &quot; better .
his name is david nolan , and that &apos;s his wife kathryn .
and the joy on her face-- well ...
it &apos;s put me in quite the forgiving mood .
we &apos;ll talk about your insubordination later .
do you know what insubordination means ?
it means you &apos;re grounded .
thank you .
thank you for finding my david .
um , i don &apos;t-- i don &apos;t understand .
you didn &apos;t--you didn &apos;t know that he was here in a coma ?
a few years ago , david and i were ... not getting along .
it was my fault . i know that now .
i was difficult and unsupportive .
i told him if he didn &apos;t like things , he could leave ,
and he did ,
and i didn &apos;t stop him .
it was the worst mistake i ever made .
you didn &apos;t go look for him ?
i assumed he &apos;d left town all this time .
now i know why i never heard from him .
now i get to do what i &apos;ve wanted to do forever--
say &quot; i &apos;m sorry . &quot;
now we get a second chance .
that &apos;s ... wonderful .
well , it &apos;s something of a miracle .
he &apos;s okay ?
physically , he &apos;s on the mend .
um , his memory is another issue .
it may take time , if at all .
what brought him back ?
that &apos;s the thing . there &apos;s no explanation .
something just clicked in him .
he just got up and decided to go for a stroll ?
he woke up and he was delirious ,
and ... his first instinct was to go find something , i guess .
someone .
can i see him ?
yeah , of course .
henry , let &apos;s go .
wait . my backpack .
don &apos;t believe them .
you &apos;re the one he was looking for .
henry .
he was going to the troll bridge .
it &apos;s like the end of the story .
henry , he was going there
because it &apos;s the last thing i read to him .
no , it &apos;s because you belong together .
henry .
madame mayor ?
wait by the car ?
ms. swan , i let you off the hook back there . don &apos;t press it .
i &apos;m sorry , but mrs. nolan--
kinda feels like her story could be a load of crap .
all this time , there &apos;s a john doe lying around in a coma
and nobody puts it in the news ?
nobody goes looking ?
something &apos;s not right here .
well , what else would make sense to you ?
why would ms. nolan lie ?
oh , do you think i cast a spell on her ?
i think it &apos;s rather strange
you &apos;ve been his emergency contact all these years ,
and you only found her now .
well , this town is bigger than you know .
it &apos;s entirely possible to get lost here .
it &apos;s entirely possible for bad things to happen .
and just when it &apos;s convenient , you manage to solve the mystery ?
thanks to you . that tape you found--
that was a stroke of genius .
so we went back and looked at past tapes .
turns out mr. doe &apos;s been talking in his sleep .
he &apos;s been calling out for a &quot; kathryn . &quot;
after that , it wasn &apos;t hard to put the pieces together .
and here i thought you and mary margaret would be pleased .
true love won out .
so bask in the moment , dear .
were it not for you two ,
they would have lived their lives completely alone .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m willing to forgive your incessant rudeness ,
because ...
all this has reminded me of something also very important ...
how grateful i am to have henry .
because not having someone ...
that &apos;s the worst curse imaginable .
emma .
sorry to bother you so late .
is that ...
spare room still available ?
