第六季 第二十二集 &#91; 本季终 &#93;
no . i actually ...
no , it &apos;s not a good idea .
medical marijuana ?
yes . why are you laughing ?
it &apos;s legal now .
because , jacob , there is a fine line
between legal and illegal in this business .
why don &apos;t you just start a nursery ?
i have a business partner
who thinks that this is the better way to go .
let me study up on the regulations ,
and i &apos;ll call you back . jacob , go slow on this .
daddy !
okay , thanks .
all done .
wow . catering .
this must be serious .
just , uh , trying to be respectful of your time .
so , what &apos;s new ?
i &apos;ve been asked to run for president .
not the response i expected , but okay .
by whom ?
the illinois democratic committee .
why ?
are you kidding ?
no . i mean , the race is
already happening , isn &apos;t it ? you &apos;re late .
not to announce . i &apos;m not running to win .
i &apos;m running to be vice president .
the party analyzed the race and decided that the current
frontrunners wouldn &apos;t accept each other as vice president ,
so that meant there &apos;s room for an outsider .
what do you think ?
oh , sorry . i have to get that .
hello .
滑动拨号
yikes .
滑动收听
yeah , can i help you ?
let go of the window .
get your hands off me , man . no , take your hands off !
you want a bullet in your head ?
let go of the window !
no , no ! wait a minute ...
he &apos;s got his cell phone on .
i don &apos;t have any cash !
and it &apos;s recording . check his pocket .
alicia ! alicia , help me , help ...
hi . this is jacob rickter .
please leave a message at the beep .
alicia , we have to head out .
sorry . a client .
okay , listen ,
i &apos;m not running
unless you and the kids agree to it .
peter , i reacted too fast .
congratulations . i know this is what you &apos;ve always wanted .
it is pretty amazing . thank you .
hello .
nicole , hi . i &apos;m jacob &apos;s lawyer .
i was just talking to jacob . is he still there ?
no , he went out to meet with greg .
want me to have him call ?
oh , uh , is greg his partner ?
yes . why ?
do you know where they were meeting ?
no , i don &apos;t . what &apos;s wrong , alicia ?
nothing . it &apos;s probably nothing ,
but i need to get a hold of jacob .
can you try greg for me ?
sure . hold on .
mrs. florrick . hi .
it &apos;s me .
mr. lester ?
i thought i &apos;d just drop by .
my wife says i &apos;m not spontaneous enough , so ...
actually , mr. lester , i &apos;m a bit busy .
yes , me , too .
may i come in ?
actually , i &apos;m in the midst , mr. lester .
do you need the phone number for mr. bishop &apos;s new lawyers ?
you know mr. bishop &apos;s in jail awaiting trial ?
yes , i did . but again , i &apos;m not his ...
can i have a glass of water ?
it &apos;s just so hot outside .
sure .
so , um , how is your friend , uh , kalinda ?
how ? i don &apos;t know .
mr. bishop is very interested in her whereabouts .
do you happen to have any idea where that might be ?
no .
oh , you didn &apos;t need to bring me the whole bottle .
i always think these things are such a waste ,
just ending up in a landfill somewhere .
i recycle .
so , kalinda &apos;s gone from her apartment , her cell phone &apos;s off .
no one seems to know where she is .
and yet in court two days ago ,
you said kalinda talked to you about your case .
so that makes you the last person to talk to her .
so , did she happen to leave you anything , alicia ?
a note or anything ?
no .
really ?
a good friend like you ?
it would make things so much
less complicated for you if you helped me .
for you and your family .
do you know who was just here , mr. lester ?
kalinda ?
no .
my husband , the governor .
maybe you &apos;ve heard of him .
he was here with his two bodyguards .
two more downstairs and two in his suv .
you may have seen them when you arrived ?
they gave me a panic button in the kitchen ,
and when i went to get your water , i pushed it .
so if i were you , i would take
your little bottle of water and go .
and tell mr. bishop i no longer work for him .
okay , i got hold of greg .
oh , nicole , hold on one second .
i need to take this , mr. lester .
if you could take five steps back so i can close the door .
next time you talk to kalinda , tell her i need to speak to her .
good @-@ bye , mr. lester .
sorry , nicole . what did he say ?
well , he said that jacob never showed up .
what &apos;s going on ? what did you hear ?
i @-@ i don &apos;t know ,
but it sounded like jacob had turned on his phone
so i could hear him being accosted by ... two men .
what two men ?
i don &apos;t know . look , it might not be anything .
he had money , alicia , uh , for his business .
let me call the police .
why did he call you ?
what ?
why you , alicia ? why not me ?
nicole , hold on for a second .
what ? wait .
what are you doing ?
i have an idea .
there &apos;s a chance he called me because he was being arrested .
i think what i heard was an arrest .
okay , call me back , alicia .
i will . don &apos;t worry .
29th district booking . how may i direct your call ?
yes . this is alicia florrick .
my client was arrested a half hour ago ,
and i need you to check the arrest queue for his cb number .
client &apos;s name ?
jacob rickter .
hold , please .
cary , hi . do you have a minute ?
yeah . wait . hold on , alicia .
completely ridiculous . you &apos;re being so obtuse ...
what is it ?
do you have any way of getting in touch with kalinda ?
no . why ?
charles lester was here .
when ?
a minute ago .
are you all right ?
yes .
what did he want ?
he wanted to talk to kalinda , find out where she was .
cary , do you have an opinion on this ?
it &apos;s not about
opinions , diane .
of course it &apos;s about opinions .
it &apos;s about opinions , it &apos;s about beliefs .
no , no .
it &apos;s the smart move .
you &apos;re always talking about smart ...
what ?
david ?
david , what ?
simone ?
yes .
you &apos;re the new paralegal ?
yes . oh , did you need anything ?
oh , sure .
did you know louis canning &apos;s wife works here ?
what ?
what ?
he still hasn &apos;t called .
and central booking says he wasn &apos;t arrested .
oh , my god . alicia ...
do you have your cell phone ?
did jacob set this up ?
yes . why ?
there &apos;s this app on both your iphones if he set it up . good .
find a phone .
what &apos;s that ?
it &apos;s the last location of jacob &apos;s phone .
南霍曼大道
my client is here . jacob rickter .
may i see him , please ?
right , he was just signed in two hours ago . hold on .
hello , ma &apos;am .
i was wrong . he &apos;s not here .
uh ... i &apos;m sorry . what ?
the man you asked about--
he &apos;s not here .
but you just said he was .
yeah . yes , uh , i made a mistake .
you ... may i look at your database ?
no . he &apos;s not here .
how @-@ how can you make that kind of mistake ?
i mean , he &apos;s either here or he &apos;s not .
ma &apos;am , i &apos;m gonna have to ask you to leave .
it &apos;s against the law
to hold him without access to his lawyer ,
and i &apos;m his lawyer .
mike , i need your help out here !
please , ma &apos;am .
what ? my client has a constitutional guarantee ...
do you have an automobile near here , ma &apos;am ?
you can let go . i &apos;m fine .
okay , we &apos;re gonna need you to drive away , ma &apos;am .
or what ?
or you &apos;ll be interfering in police matters .
you have a nice day , ma &apos;am .
yeah , it &apos;s homan square .
excuse me ?
homan square . it houses the bomb squad and the undercover cops
and ... the police sometimes hold suspects there , too .
yeah , but they can &apos;t ... they ... they wouldn &apos;t
let me in to see my client .
yeah , but your client &apos;s not under arrest yet .
so the police have taken him , but he wasn &apos;t arrested ?
yup .
because if he was arrested , i would be allowed to see him ?
right .
oh , my god , this is insane .
you need to file a habeas petition right away .
the police mostly take people to homan square
that nobody cares about , so you start caring ...
they &apos;ll release him .
got it . wow .
oh , alicia . i &apos;ve thought about it .
what ?
you and me .
uh , starting a firm .
oh , right .
we @-@ we should do it .
oh , my god .
sorry . i thought you were gonna say no . and i ...
wow , i &apos;ve been apologizing a lot lately . i need to stop doing that .
that ... this is great news . partner .
okay . so , we &apos;re off .
right .
our first client . jacob rickter .
jacob rickter .
we have a habeas matter , i believe ,
but we also have the matter of lunch .
the people are willing to delay until after lunch , your honor .
unfortunately , this is time @-@ sensitive , your honor .
we have a client being held by police
and we need access to him .
he &apos;s not being held .
okay , okay . can this be argued in less than five minutes ?
yes , your honor .
no , your honor .
well , let &apos;s live dangerously and try .
take your hands off !
you want a bullet in your head ?
let go of the window !
no , no ! wait a minute ...
he &apos;s got his cell phone on .
i don &apos;t have any cash !
and it &apos;s recording . check his pocket .
alicia ! alicia , help me , help me , plea ...
that &apos;s an arrest , your honor .
i don &apos;t know what that it is , but there is no foundation
for any part of that .
mr. brody ,
it &apos;s a simple matter , as habeas petitions go .
why can &apos;t you produce mr. rickter ?
very simply , your honor , we don &apos;t have him .
as was explained to mrs. florrick on numerous occasions ,
her client is not in the cb database .
we have not arrested him .
he &apos;s being held in homan square .
do you know that for a fact , counselor ?
we have his wife &apos;s cell phone showing us that his cell is there .
no , it was just turned off there .
it &apos;s not determinative .
anyway , when i hear that call ,
it doesn &apos;t sound like the police .
it sounds like a person being accosted .
he &apos;s right , counselors . call the police
or bring me stronger evidence of an arrest .
otherwise , i don &apos;t know what to do . lunch .
i &apos;m diane lockhart .
yes . i know .
uh , do you need something ?
no , no .
i just wanted to introduce myself .
you &apos;re simone ...
raushenbush .
ah , that &apos;s your maiden name ?
yes .
is that a problem ?
no .
i just think we know your husband .
yes , you do . louis canning .
i used my maiden name in the interview
because i wanted to get this job on my own .
is that all right ?
yes .
uh , just to be clear ,
we &apos;re often in competition with your husband .
oh , i know . i am completely discreet .
completely . you can totally trust me .
nice to meet you .
you as well .
lockhart , agos &amp; lee . please hold .
ms. lockhart .
hello , how are you ?
mr. lester .
you know , it seems that every time
i come up here , this place has a new name .
well , we like to keep you on your toes .
in fact , it &apos;s , uh ,
actually mr. bishop &apos;s intention
to only pursue legitimate work from now on .
cary , hello .
mr. lester .
lemond bishop
is thinking of bringing his business back here .
really ? i thought he was in jail .
he is , yes . uh ,
thus the disappointment
in his current representation .
so , uh , where &apos;s that great little investigator
you have around here ?
kalinda doesn &apos;t work here anymore .
where does she work ?
we don &apos;t know . she left .
well , let me , uh ,
leave you my number .
certainly .
oh , and if , uh , kalinda gets in touch with you ,
you can reach me at this number ,
day or night . talk to you soon .
he &apos;s after kalinda ?
yes .

what &apos;s going on ? are we in trouble ?
are we moving ?
no , your mom and i just wanted
to run something by you .
it &apos;s not over yet ,
nicole . we have a sympathetic judge
and we have new evidence .
i have to go . uh , i &apos;ll talk to you .
sorry . court ran late .
did you , uh , have the talk already ?
no , we just started .
started what ?
okay , so ...
the democratic committee ...
sorry .
the democratic committee has asked me to run for president .
you &apos;re kidding .
that &apos;s great . when ?
uh , well , i &apos;d have to start making trips to iowa next week .
the white house , wow . i &apos;ll be one metro stop away .
actually , it &apos;s not to win .
the logic is , i would run to make myself
a viable candidate for vice president .
cool . that &apos;s still cool .
grace ?
well , would you run together ?
what do you mean ?
you and mom--
would you go to iowa together ?
well , i don &apos;t know if i &apos;ll have the time .
well , maybe ... maybe a few times , hopefully .
look , nothing &apos;s been decided .
i &apos;m not gonna run unless we all agree .
this is going to be a family consensus .
are you still gonna pretend you &apos;re married ?
we don &apos;t have to pretend-- we are married .
you &apos;re living in your apartment , dad .
and mom &apos;s here .
well , that &apos;s because i have to be in springfield .
yes . we &apos;d still have to pretend .
peter .
close the door , okay ?
are we gonna be angry with each other ?
no .
peter ...
you already decided .
don &apos;t put it on us .
put what ? i haven &apos;t decided .
look ...
grace will approve your decision
because she knows you want to run ,
and she doesn &apos;t want to stand in your way .
and then they &apos;ll rip us to shreds ,
because that &apos;s what the press does .
they &apos;ll look into our lives ,
our families , our children ,
and grace will blame herself .
it &apos;s not her decision .
you know it &apos;s not her decision .
it &apos;s yours and eli &apos;s .
you don &apos;t think i can walk away from this ?
i don &apos;t think you can walk away from this .
then you don &apos;t know me .
okay .
i don &apos;t approve .
if it &apos;s up to your family ,
i don &apos;t want you to run for president .
okay .
officer , hello .
you know jacob rickter is in that building , sir .
why don &apos;t you just leave me alone , please ?
his family is going crazy .
they &apos;re worried he &apos;s dead or kidnapped .
i don &apos;t think you realize how bad this is .
jacob rickter is epileptic .
he &apos;s been 12 hours without his medication .
in another four hours he could be dead .
you &apos;re lying .
and if he dies ,
officer tannerman , everybody in that building
has deniability except you .
you &apos;re the only one i &apos;ve told .
and i will sue you for everything you have .
you &apos;re lying .
you have any doubts , call his doctor .
go ahead , call him .
he &apos;ll tell you .
how long do you think we should give it ?
another hour .
alicia , can i be up front with you ?
have you not been ?
no , i have been , but , um ...
this girl that i &apos;m seeing is my ex @-@ wife .
we &apos;re making another go at it .
that &apos;s great . good .
yeah , it is great . it is great .
i don &apos;t like failing at things .
and i @-@ i feel like i failed at it , so ...
no , it &apos;s fantastic .
so it &apos;s not gonna get in the way of us working together ?
what ? no , no . no .
good .
because i want it to work .
hello .
you want to talk to me about my patient , jacob rickter ?
oh , nothing yet , sir . but i &apos;m just getting started .
nah , only if i need help .
do you know how many frozen pizza choices there are ?
it &apos;s like a nightmare of pizzas .
yes , uh ... yes , sir .
i &apos;ll call you , uh , when they make the next move .
thanks .
you looking for me ?
hello , kalinda .
i was wondering when you &apos;d contact me .
well , you can stop wondering .
one more thing off the list .
so ...
maybe you can help me with a problem i &apos;m having .
oh , i was just thinking about recording .
an old lawyer &apos;s habit .
so ... what &apos;s the problem ?
problem ?
do you know a good frozen pizza ?
no .
my wife says pizza in the wall .
now , i &apos;ve never tried it .
listen to me , mr. lester ,
i &apos;m limited for time , so , um ...
do you have a question ?
yes .
did you betray mr. bishop ?
no .
and yet you ran .
i didn &apos;t run .
you moved out of your apartment .
you canceled your cell plan .
in mr. bishop &apos;s line of work ,
those are very suspicious acts .
i read the writing on the wall .
really ? what writing was that ?
dexter was blaming me
for bishop &apos;s arrest .
well , i will admit ,
my suspicions fall between him and you .
but dexter has the advantage because he &apos;s actually here ,
talking to mr. bishop .
you &apos;re not .
hey ! pizza in the wall it is .
i &apos;ll make a deal with you , mr. lester .
you leave my work and my friends alone ,
and i will come and see mr. bishop .
and who do we define as your friends ?
you know who .
look , i will make my case to mr. bishop ,
but you need to butt out of my life .
when could you meet with him ?
wednesday . 8 : 00 .
in the visiting room .
earlier would be better .
wait , what about my phone ?
buy a new one .
all rise !
what &apos;s going on , matan ?
have you got him or not ?
this is all news to me , your honor .
i don &apos;t approve of mrs. florrick
and mr. polmar &apos;s little ploy .
it does seem the police were tricked
into calling this nonexistent doctor .
however , they admitted to having their client .
yes , and i contacted the officers at homan square ,
but they insist , at the time of the habeas hearing yesterday ,
they did not have mr. rickter .
that is b.s. , your honor .
mrs. florrick , you &apos;re winning here .
be gracious .
this is my ruling . i want the police
to open the homan square doors to mr. rickter &apos;s lawyers now .
good . our first win .
well , don &apos;t count your chickens .
mrs. florrick . oh .
mr. kingsley @-@ weaver . did we have a meeting today ?
um , finn , this is my ghostwriter .
oh , really ? wow . that &apos;s , um ...
impressive .
i just heard you were in court this afternoon ,
and i thought it might help
with the writing of the memoir .
oh , actually , today i &apos;m just a bit busy .
perfect . i &apos;ll just stay out of your way .
look , we have to fire her !
we don &apos;t know if canning put her here as a spy .
come on . she &apos;s not a spy .
i talked to her . she used her maiden name .
oh , because she &apos;s worried about nepotism ?
seriously ?
yes .
and she &apos;s doing good work .
look , she goes home to canning and talks , pillow talk .
she promised not to share confidential information .
and she might not even know she &apos;s sharing it .
i know canning .
he &apos;ll use anything .
i agree . we have to let her go .
we just had a cyber @-@ attack
on our e @-@ mail system that almost destroyed us .
can &apos;t keep dropping our guard .
good .
i &apos;ll fire her .
no .
two name partners against one , diane .
no , i &apos;ll do it .
i don &apos;t ...
we &apos;re just economizing .
y ... i &apos;m ... please don &apos;t fire ...
i can do more .
you know , i can work harder .
it &apos;s not that .
you were doing great , and we &apos;ll give you a good reference .
there are no other jobs out there .
well , maybe with your husband .
i did this on my own .
this was me .
i know .
i &apos;m so very sorry .
i have a court order for you ...
i have a court order for you to allow me to see my client .
yes , we received word from the court .
and good news , mrs. florrick ,
he &apos;s already meeting with his lawyer .
excuse me ?
mr. rickter is already meeting with his lawyer .
i &apos;m his lawyer .
not according to mr. rickter .
he &apos;s already talking with his lawyer .
i want to see him now .
i &apos;m sorry , mrs. florrick ,
but he is in a meeting with his lawyer .
i know you &apos;re desperate for his business .
the judge is gonna crucify you .
have a nice day .
meet me in court .
they &apos;re screwing with us .
okay .
notice how calm i am .
let me speak this clearly and simply , mr. brody .
i want mr. rickter here , in my court , today .
if he is not here in the next two hours ,
i will hold you personally in contempt .
and i will begin assigning fines .
are my words clear ?
they are , your honor .
he will be here in two hours .
so this is a standard case for your new firm ?
well , he &apos;s only my second client ,
so it &apos;s too early to tell .
why are you doing this ?
is it about injustice ?
he needed help .
it &apos;s like a puzzle .
how do you get the law to help someone ?
but ...
you care ?
you care ?
do i care ? yes . um ...
what @-@ what is that , a rough draft ?
yes . i like to give my notes some shape .
but it &apos;s not really a narrative yet .
may i see it ?
actually , let me get it in better shape .
whose notes are those ?
oh , just ... feedback .
feedback from whom ?
eli ?
i &apos;m not really supposed to say anything .
it &apos;s my memoir , right ?
i &apos;ll be right back .
you rang , madam first lady ?
sit down , eli .
i would , but i @-@ i don &apos;t like sitting on steps .
i always think dogs urinate there .
whose idea was the memoir ?
whose idea ? mine .
and what was the point ?
to introduce you to the public .
to rehabilitate me .
i wouldn &apos;t put it that way .
but sure , it &apos;s a good way to put
the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s race behind you .
&quot; too much ball busting .
softer words needed .
why the emphasis on work versus home ? &quot;
where &apos;d you get that ?
&quot; rethink . &quot; are these your edits ?
yes .
so , you &apos;re remaking me as ...
a homemaker ?
no .
but the ghostwriter wanted to drive it towards
courtroom and action , and i just wanted it ...
a bit more balanced .
so , you want me to play the wife ...
with the cookie recipes ?
alicia , no .
&quot; ask a. for possible recipes here . &quot;
okay , that was a bad idea .
don &apos;t patronize me , eli .
i read your notes .
it &apos;s a good story .
it &apos;s a story with a lesson .
but it &apos;s not true .
what &apos;s &quot; true &quot; ? !
okay .
no to this .
no to being first lady . no to everything .
jacob , thank god . are you okay ?
i &apos;m good .
but i should &apos;ve taken your advice .
with ?
about the business .
going slow .
why ? what &apos;s wrong ?
mr. rickter , finally !
there was a godot @-@ like quality to our experiences ...
your honor , if i may interject ?
mr. rickter has confessed
to an intent to acquire 25 marijuana plants .
what ? !
a class @-@ three felony
with a minimum sentence of two to five years .
he had no representation . we had no access to him .
he did not ask for a lawyer ,
so no lawyer was provided .
he was held in homan square ...
yes . but now we &apos;re addressing
a different matter , counselors .
i imagine you would move to throw out this confession .
yes , your honor , definitely .
i will hear arguments on this tomorrow .
mr. rickter , you will stay in our custody until then .
have a good evening .
he never asked for an attorney .
yes , but did they mirandize him ?
because the confession is illegal
if they never read him his miranda rights .
well , they &apos;ll just argue that he was never under arrest .
so we &apos;ll refute that .
put jacob on the stand ?
right . good !
okay , good .
i &apos;ll see you tomorrow .
have a good night .
i thought you were gone .
i was .
charles lester is asking about you .
i don &apos;t think it &apos;s safe here .
it is for five minutes .
tequila .
you sure ?
yeah .
for the road .
i left you a note , alicia .
you didn &apos;t give it to lester ?
i didn &apos;t want to .
it &apos;s a confession .
i left it in case anyone came after me .
it gets you off the hook , alicia .
you need to give him the note .
i &apos;m serious , alicia .
you need to give him the note .
a great thing happened when i lost the election .
i gave up .
anger , jealousy ... what people thought--
i just threw them overboard .
it &apos;s nice not to care .
it made me miss just sitting in a bar ...
drinking ...
with you .
one more ?
alicia , i , uh ...
i don &apos;t really ...
i &apos;m not very good at talking .
i never have been , but ...
i do need to say this .
my time with you
as your friend was ,
was the best i ever had .
and ... i &apos;m sorry .
and i &apos;m ...
i &apos;m really sorry that things got messed up .
i wish we had the chance to ... do it over again .
i have to go .
i &apos;ll never see you again ?
i don &apos;t think so .
that &apos;s too bad .
i , um ...
good @-@ bye .
damn you !
damn you three !
mr. canning .
you &apos;ve hurt the one person i love
more than anything on this planet .
your wife was working here as ...
she &apos;s sobbing at home !
she &apos;s inconsolable .
you know , i &apos;ve never , in @-@ in all our years of struggle ,
i have never gone after any of your family members .
we have no family members .
it &apos;s always been business first , but no more .
and i @-@ i &apos;m gonna burn this place to the ground .
i &apos;d watch your words , mr. canning .
i want to be methodical about this ; i want to take my time .
just know this-- i will pull you three apart
until there &apos;s nothing left .
what can he do ?
nothing .
he &apos;s a wounded beast , crying out .
best just to turn away .
i was handcuffed in a small room .
with bars ?
yes .
was there anyone else in this room ?
now and then , they &apos;d bring someone in ,
cuff him beside me and then take him out .
were you fed ?
once .
a bologna sandwich .
did anyone tell you
that you could have an attorney ?
no .
why did you confess ?
because they said they &apos;d let me go .
your honor ,
homan square has been called chicago &apos;s &quot; black site &quot;
come on .
well , what else would you call it ?
a place where citizens are taken without warrant ,
without warning , without rights ,
and then questioned until they confess .
now , your honor , i am staggered
that we still have to stand here
and argue over the legality of this .
the confession should be thrown out , your honor .
it was coerced .
he was a danger to himself ,
that &apos;s why we cuffed him .
it &apos;s police policy .
why did you not tell him his rights ?
because he was not under arrest .
thank you , officer .
when the judge ordered you
to grant me access to mr. rickter ,
did you deny it to me ?
i &apos;m embarrassed to say that i did .
i made a mistake .
i thought it was mr. rickter who had a lawyer ,
but it was another person .
what was the name of this &quot; other person &quot; ?
you know , i don &apos;t remember .
really ? how surprising .
the snark is uncalled for , your honor .
the simple truth , ma &apos;am ,
is that we did nothing wrong .
your client confessed
while he was in our care
and not under arrest .
i &apos;d be more upset about your client &apos;s crimes
than about our mistakes .
so we need someone on the inside
to substantiate rickter &apos;s account .
officer tannerman ?
do you think he &apos;ll talk ?
our best bet .
you sounded good in court today .
yeah ? the speech ?
i don &apos;t give many of those-- i was angry .
and look how effective that was .
well , it looks good on you-- anger .
i got to go .
right , i know .
yeah , it &apos;s getting late .
9 : 00 .
well , if i stay , i &apos;ll just get sloppy , and then ...
something or other ,
and then i don &apos;t know what will happen .
something bad ?
very bad .
mrs. florrick .
it &apos;s kismet .
i just was knocking on your door .
really ?
do you have a minute ?
sure .
do you want me to wait here ?
no , come on in .
i hate to return to old subjects ,
but , uh , kalinda promised to meet with mr. bishop yesterday ,
and she never showed up .
do you know what happened ?
no .
well , has kalinda been in touch with you ?
just one moment , mr. lester .
what is that ?
it &apos;s kalinda &apos;s letter to me .
why did you do that ?
i didn &apos;t want you to have it .
what did it say ?
it said good @-@ bye .
good @-@ bye , mr. lester .
now , your fellow officer stated
that mr. rickter was a danger to himself and others .
was that your observation , too ?
officer tannerman ?
i was not in a position to make any observation .
but you saw mr. rickter being brought in to homan square ?
no , i did not .
you didn &apos;t ?
but you told mrs. florrick
that you saw her client being brought in .
yes , i made a mistake .
oh , you made a mistake that you saw mr. rickter .
oh , well ...
yes , i only heard over the radio
that they were bringing in a 10 @-@ 26 .
that &apos;s all .
10 @-@ 26-- you &apos;re sure that was , that was jacob rickter ?
yes , that &apos;s all i know .
i didn &apos;t actually see them bring him in .
10 @-@ 26 .
10 @-@ 2 ... what is a 10 @-@ 26 , officer ?
chicago police code for detained arrestee .
and jacob rickter was that detained arrestee .
objection . counselor is putting words in the witness &apos; mouth .
from their own words , your honor .
because they believe that our client was already under arrest ,
and therefore he should have been mirandized
and offered the services of a lawyer .
this was a slip on the radio , your honor , that &apos;s all .
officer tannerman ,
did you clearly hear mr. rickter referred to
by the 10 @-@ 26 designation ?
yes , i did .
then i have no choice
but throw out the confession of mr. rickter .
yes !
motion sustained , we are adjourned .
good job , partner .
so this phone here , could you tell me something ab ... ?
hello .
ah , thank you , kalinda .
hate getting new phones .
so you didn &apos;t show up for your talk with bishop .
uh , he was disappointed .
i was planning to see him , but then i realized
bishop &apos;s leaving the business .
he &apos;s giving it all to dexter ,
so what &apos;s the point in meeting him ?
he has no power .
i don &apos;t think it &apos;s a good idea
to test mr. bishop &apos;s power .
why not ?
because he has people like me working for him .
you know , uh , i downloaded a flash drive of data
from bishop &apos;s computer ,
and it had receipts and notes on your , uh , employment .
but i didn &apos;t see a reason
to give it to the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s office .
you could always give me a reason .
that &apos;s a bluff .
no .
what is it with all these tough @-@ talking women ?
you know a word you don &apos;t hear very much anymore ?
demure .
how about bringing that one back ?
sounds like you &apos;re stalling .
all right , okay .
i couldn &apos;t find you , i looked and looked ,
but you were gone .
now , don &apos;t make me a liar by coming back , okay ?
don &apos;t worry .
wait .
are you sure you wouldn &apos;t want to start up something together ?
a business ?
we could dominate .
no , uh ...
i &apos;m good .
oh , good .
hi .
i was just thinking about the other night .
yeah , me , too .
and i was thinking that we can really make this work .
i was looking online at office spaces ,
and if we don &apos;t want too much space , it &apos;s really pretty cheap .
alicia .
that doesn &apos;t sound good .
i can &apos;t be doing this .
doing what ?
there &apos;s , um ...
something ...
between us .
and we push it ,
and then we say we won &apos;t ,
and then we push it again , and ...
i can &apos;t live that way .
i can &apos;t .
we don &apos;t have to push it .
i know .
but it &apos;s not always &quot; do &quot; or &quot; don &apos;t . &quot;
i don &apos;t want to work alone .
yeah , i know .
i &apos;m sorry .
but ... i have to go .
bye .
stupid ...
stupid .
want a partner ?
