and we have liftoff .
yello ? house of the future .
phil , you have two whole days to yourself .
please tell me you &apos;re not gonna spend them
trying to wire the house to your ipad .
nope , &apos; cause i &apos;ve already done it .
i think when you get home ,
you &apos;re gonna be very surprised to see that this house
has an actual functioning brain in it .
great . great .
now go out and see some friends .
i &apos;m headed out now .
i have a third showing at that colonial .
cam gave me a free pass to his gym .
i am--not too bright .
i am--
dim !
honey , if you could hear yourself .
promise me you &apos;ll go outside and play .
miss you , too .
phil dunphy , this is the year 2025 .
welcome . you &apos;re the first one here .
shall we hit the waterslide first ?
i may just sit in the room for a bit .
ugh ! stop moping !
so you didn &apos;t get a date to one stupid dance .
it &apos;s not one stupid dance .
it &apos;s the kickoff to the whole dance season .
it &apos;s like you &apos;ve never heard boys talk .
hi . we are here for the academic challenge .
it &apos;s under &quot; dunphy . &quot;
or it could be under &quot; returning champion . &quot;
not sure how they file these things .
alex wins things , which is great .
but she puts so much pressure on herself .
i ... i almost wish she would lose this year .
plus , that way , i could go on the waterslide .
it &apos;s got a corkscrew , 2 @-@ second freefall ,
and a radar gun at the bottom .
i &apos;m phil .
nothing from the minibar , and no pay @-@ per @-@ view .
can we at least--
no , you may not send things out for pressing .
honey , we have an hour until the competition .
do you want to go to the contestants mixer ?
no , i don &apos;t want to humanize them .
can you believe this is my first bar mitzvah ?
you &apos;ll love it . i heard the gift bags have smartphones .
jewish people are so awesome .
oh , my god . did you see that ? she smiled at me .
people get that way in dance season .
no girl &apos;s ever smiled at me like that .
luke , we have to go to that bar mitzvah .
why ?
there was a connection .
i know this sounds crazy ,
but i feel like my whole life has led to this moment .
you made a very similar speech
to get my mom to stop for those churros .
luke , i need you for this . you &apos;re sneakier than i am .
you &apos;re a bigger liar . you have no moral compass .
look , thanks for all the compliments ,
but breaking into one stupid party ?
that &apos;s not even a challenge .
oh , no . three bar mitzvahs ?
now it &apos;s interesting .
cam , stop .
what ? we have to get them out of there .
what &apos;s taking them ?
we have the most amazing gift for jay and gloria &apos;s nursery .
it was cam &apos;s idea , and it &apos;s a pretty big swing .
it &apos;s not a swing . it &apos;s not a swing .
i just need jay and gloria out of the house
for a minimum of four hours
so i can have my crew install it .
simple .
oh , please . if it were up to you ,
we &apos;d get them something off their gift registry .
oh , you mean the list of things
that they specifically said that they wanted ?
oh , they don &apos;t know what they want .
... before i snap his finger off !
ay , no .
jay was supposed to cancel . we cannot go to lunch .
oh , no .
i am sorry ,
but he &apos;s supposed to pick up the crib at the store ,
and i am too tired . the baby kicked me all night .
it &apos;s either going to be a football player
or a chorus girl .
you can be both .
my senior year , i was a right @-@ side linebacker
and a left @-@ side cancan dancer in &quot; gigi . &quot;
wow , she really set you up for that one , didn &apos;t she ?
yeah , when it came out of her mouth ,
i nearly stopped breathing .
you didn &apos;t call them to cancel .
sorry . you want gas money ?
don &apos;t pay attention to him .
he &apos;s been very grumpy lately .
okay , here &apos;s a thought--
mitchell , you go to the crib store with jay .
that way i can spend some quality time
with this pretty lady .
no , i &apos;m going to lay down .
no , no , i &apos;m gonna take you both to lunch .
okay ? there , it &apos;s settled . now go put a lip on . okay ?
fine . i guess you won &apos;t get in the way .
you mean it , pa ? really and for true ?
i won &apos;t get in the way ?
oh , that &apos;s a good idea .
oh , yeah . the chairs are rocks .
charlemagne .
you can get a 1 @-@ day cushion for $ 8,
or a 2 @-@ day for $ 12 .
alex dunphy .
last year , i got 2.1 @-@ dayers--big mistake .
who wrote the 95 theses ?
my daughter went on to win the whole thing ,
and all i could think was ,
&quot; i just flushed $ 4 down the toilet . &quot;
john calvin .
whoo ! alex !
i guess i just didn &apos;t want to presume
that we would be here for the two days .
but still , what kind of message
was i sending with the 1 @-@ dayer ?
you &quot; whoo &apos;d &quot; me ?
what are you doing here ?
i &apos;m out . i got the question wrong ,
which is embarrassing enough without you &quot; whoo @-@ ing &quot; me !
alex ! alex , come back here . don &apos;t !
don &apos;t !
wait , what are the last four numbers again ?
1 @-@ 9 @-@ 8 @-@ 4 .
it &apos;s kind of a lucky number for me .
it &apos;s the year &quot; footloose &quot; came out .
oh , yeah . and i really am gonna call you for that rematch .
anytime . i mean , not super late ,
but ... wait ,
you &apos;re a bulldog ?
yeah . you ?
i knew there was something about you i liked .
oh , you mean besides me letting you win ?
you know , we have a big game today .
you wanna watch it together ?
shoot . i &apos;m--i &apos;m late for a showing .
no pressure at all , but if you feel like it ,
we could watch it at my place . i could text you the address .
all right . well , thanks .
hey , it was great meeting you , phil .
you , too , dave .
hey , it &apos;s me .
yeah , you were totally right about this gym .
i just met the cutest guy .
what did i tell you ?
that place is like a gay bar with dumbbells .
redundant .
well , i don &apos;t know much about him ,
but he invited me over to his place
o watch a football game tonight .
oh , my gosh , a date .
i have a good feeling about this .
oh , well , don &apos;t start planning the wedding yet .
i mean , i &apos;m not even sure if it &apos;s a date date .
you met him at hook @-@ up central .
of course it &apos;s a date date .
am i even ready for a date date ?
tough love time , david--
simon left you six months ago ,
and you &apos;re bumming everyone out .
it &apos;s time to get back up on that horse .
hope to see you tonight , dave .
i can &apos;t remember the last time
a man made that sound for me .
she &apos;s not here . we have the wrong bar mitzvah .
not if you like prime rib , bubbie .
you said to blend .
i picked up some expressions at the latke station .
p.s.--they &apos;re hash browns .
we &apos;re not blending .
she &apos;s at one of the other two .
come on .
oh . sorry .
such a hurry , this one .
come on .
that is too cute .
what the hell is that ?
oh , that &apos;s the store mascot . that &apos;s hugga bunny .
he goes around and he hugs--
no , i get it .
nice for flu season .
he ought to be called conjunctivitis bunny .
okay .
uh , so , dad ,
the cribs are over there , but while we &apos;re here ,
a little advice--you can never have too many onesies .
all right ? any event , day or night .
throw one on , little pair of booties ,
boom--ready to go out .
dress it up , you could dress it down .
you could--dad ?
dad ?
something was clearly going on with my dad ,
but i wasn &apos;t about to get sucked in .
it &apos;s happened before .
&quot; dad , you seem sad . do you wanna talk ? &quot;
&quot; talk ? ! what are we , girlfriends ? &quot;
to use a sports reference ,
put the football away , lucy .
露西总喜欢把橄榄球收起来 不让查理 · 布朗踢 &#93;
i ain &apos;t kickin &apos; .
so saturday noon ?
saturday noon &apos;s fine , jay .
yeah .
hey , dad , i picked you up a diaper bag .
fun fact-- this insulated pouch
will keep a bottle of prosecco cold
for an entire wiggles concert .
hi .
uh , mitch , it &apos;s doctor--
bob jensen .
nice to meet you .
jay , i will see you .
yeah , i &apos;ll see you then . good , bob .
doctor ? sweater vest ?
my dad acting all shifty ?
he was seeing a shrink .
&quot; dad , i can see that you &apos;re going through something . &quot;
&quot; and i can see your bra strap , oprah .
mind your own business . &quot;
tee up the football all you want , lucy .
still ain &apos;t kickin &apos; .
she clearly misheard the question .
the acoustics in here are terrible .
especially for a little girl
just getting over an ear infection .
oh , my god ,
what are you doing ?
i was explaining your--
oh , i heard ,
because my ears are fine .
i &apos;m sorry . i didn &apos;t ask her to do this .
i &apos;m trying to help you .
you were not . you were trying to help you .
you &apos;re just mad because now you can &apos;t parade me around
like some show pony .
that is not true .
oh , don &apos;t deny it . you bought the 2 @-@ day cushion .
who are you to judge ?
thank you for a fun day , okay ? good @-@ bye .
good @-@ bye ?
ay , cam , sorry ,
but the lunch was two hours ,
and then you had to show me your first apartment .
oh , could you believe how i used to live ?
i really need to take a nap now .
no . no , no . no . no . no , no . no , no .
you know what ? i have , uh , something i want you to do
that &apos;s even more relaxing than a nap .
yeah .
no . i want to take a nap .
there &apos;s my man .
that &apos;s me . your man .
i brought spinach dip . i don &apos;t know why .
i &apos;ll tell you why . &apos; cause it &apos;s delicious ,
and you &apos;re an awesome guest .
get in here .
all right .
how are you ?
good . you ?
good . uh , by the way ,
i left a message for my brother @-@ in @-@ law and his partner
to join us , too .
oh , more people . good .
nice house , by the way .
thanks .
wait a minute . is that your family ?
are you married ?
yeah , but don &apos;t worry . we have the house to ourselves .
they &apos;re all out of town .
i am long overdue for a boys &apos; night .
oh , so your wife is okay with--
oh , yeah . she suggested it .
she knows i need this every so often .
long as i clean up afterwards , she &apos;s fine .
you ready for a margarita ?
sure .
soothing , right ?
you see , as the music relaxes the baby ,
you relax .
no , you &apos;re making the baby jump on my bladder .
how can it relax listening to a song about a hooker ?
she &apos;s not a hooker , she &apos;s a private dancer .
a dancer for money .
she &apos;ll do what you want her to--
oh , my gosh , i taught lily this song .
excuse me .
hello ?
he &apos;s married .
to a woman .
yeah , she &apos;s out of town .
i don &apos;t know . they must have
some sort of arrangement or something .
so what ? if they know about it ,
who cares ?
you &apos;re not ready for a relationship anyway .
just have some fun .
it feels weird . he has other people coming over .
i think i &apos;m gonna bail on this .
he &apos;s just feeling you out like you &apos;re feeling him out .
i promise you , these other guests will mysteriously cancel .
hold on just a second , sweetie .
hello ?
hey , you guys still coming ?
oh , i forgot to call you . we have to cancel .
no problem . bye .
more margaritas for us .
the other guys just cancelled .
are you still there ?
you were right . the other guys just cancelled .
see ?
now listen to me .
you &apos;re gonna have two margaritas .
maybe start a third . laugh at his jokes .
but not in that high falsetto thing .
something more manly . let &apos;s practice .
hey , i &apos;m not gonna laugh for you .
you can be very controlling , you know that ?
why does everybody say i &apos;m controlling ?
oh . gotta go .
looks like this kennel is for bulldogs only .
you all right ?
yeah , i &apos;m all right . i &apos;m great .
oh , good .
listen , uh , i @-@ i don &apos;t want this to sound weird ,
but , um ...
but you and i , tonight ... is this , uh ...
sorry , dave , what was that ?
nothing .
here you go .
for a small fee , we can come to your house
and assemble it for you .
yeah , my dad &apos;s more of a do @-@ it @-@ yourself @-@ er ,
plus he &apos;s not one for strangers in his personal space .
all right . uh , well , can i help you carry it to your car ?
yeah , he &apos;s not gonna go for that , either .
the guy won &apos;t even use the wheels on his suitcase .
likes everyone to think he &apos;s this big , tough guy who--
okay .
yo ! there he is . all right . let &apos;s get this done .
hey , dad , you know--
no , we don &apos;t need any help , mitchell .
just pick up your end .
dad , stop , stop , stop .
what ? a break already ?
dad , you &apos;re obviously going through something .
look , you do not have to go through this alone .
i &apos;m here to talk if you want .
that &apos;s really nice of you , mitchell ,
but do you wanna do it here ?
&apos;cause i saw a little princess table
with a tea set on it .
you and i could have a real gab fest .
argh ! i &apos;m such a blockhead .
can &apos;t we just get this into the car ?
why ? so you &apos;re not late for your shrink session ?
what ?
yeah . i picked up on that .
bunny hugger ! saw that , too .
mobile spinner .
i swear to god ...
what are you doing back here ? !
i didn &apos;t have the room key ,
and i don &apos;t want to be seen in public .
i thought about what you said before ...
when did china &apos;s last emperor
ascend the throne ?
1909 .
and you can say a lot of things about me ,
but i am not someone who lives through her kids .
sorry . it &apos;s 1909 .
do i like to see you succeed ?
of course i do !
tritium is an isotope of what element ?
hydrogen .
but do i need that to
make myself feel important ?
absolutely not .
no , the answer is hydrogen .
as a matter of fact , i &apos;m a little hurt
you would think i was so shallow .
the persian satrapy of skudra included which two areas ?
macedonia and thrace .
i know moms like that , and that is not me .
no way .
macedonia and thrace .
are you freaking kidding me ? !
macedonia and thrace ? what even is that ? !
you &apos;re hardly even listening ! how could we lose this ? !
i said &quot; we . &quot;
yeah . you do that sometimes .
i &apos;m so sorry .
i am one of those moms .
i like it too much when you win .
i really love lording it over the other moms .
well , in our house , i &apos;m kind of your only source for that .
you &apos;re telling me .
haley e @-@ mails me pictures of her nails .
and luke asked me if he &apos;s part owl .
he does get his head pretty far around .
alex , i &apos;m so sorry .
it &apos;s okay .
maybe you do put pressure on me ,
but it &apos;s nothing compared to what i put on myself .
i guess i needed somebody to blame for what happened today ,
and there you were .
you know i &apos;m in awe of you , right ?
come on . i know a back way out of this place .
wait . don &apos;t you have to return that ?
no way . i paid good money for this .
we &apos;re taking it down the waterslide .
okay .
how can she not be here , either ?
this is hopeless .
have a little faith .
did the jews give up when the egyptians chased them
to the banks of the red sea ?
how do you know all this stuff ?
was i the only one listening to uncle menachem &apos;s toast ?
well , i &apos;m glad it worked out for the ancient jews ,
but at the moment
i don &apos;t see god doing me any--
look !
i &apos;m not gonna embarrass you ,
but you got one minute to get out of here .
you , too .
it &apos;s for the best .
all this sneaking around was kind of weighing on me .
let &apos;s just grab our gift bags and go .
no .
i still have 50 seconds .
excuse me .
hi .
my name is manny delgado ,
and i &apos;ve been searching for you
since you smiled at me in the lobby today--
maybe even my whole life .
it &apos;s too late for us to have the magical night i was hoping for ,
but it &apos;s not too late for us
to have a memento of what might have been .
i &apos;ll be waiting .
okay , mitch--
too late . not interested .
now listen .
okay , you know what ? i &apos;m just gonna go out the back .
door , sunroof-- all on lockdown .
okay , look , that guy you met today--
he is a shrink .
but i don &apos;t see him all the time .
you mom and i saw him a little before the divorce .
but every now and then , something comes up for me ,
and i go in for a tune @-@ up .
if you &apos;re waiting for me to ask what &apos;s going on with you ,
you just better keep waiting ,
&apos;cause i learned my lesson .
i &apos;m down about something--
something i knew was coming ,
and now it &apos;s finally happening .
we &apos;re turning my office into the nursery today .
you &apos;ve been moping around like you lost your platoon
over a room ?
not just a room .
it &apos;s the only place in this house
where i can still close the door and read a book or have a drink .
everything in there was mine .
ah , who cares ? everybody &apos;s got their problems .
no .
you know , i can still open my door .
you just locked yourself back in .
look , dad , i ...
i had to give up my home office for lily &apos;s bedroom ,
and i was upset about it , too .
wasn &apos;t hugging bunnies , but ...
all right .
i @-@ i realize that it wasn &apos;t about an office or a room .
it was about how lily was gonna change everything .
but once we got her in there ,
i don &apos;t know . i @-@ i just-- i never looked back .
yeah , i guess i &apos;m just nervous about everything , you know .
yeah .
thanks , kid .
you know , i &apos;m just recalling
me grumbling about giving up my mg roadster
when you and claire came along .
great car . no backseat .
isn &apos;t it funny ? the stupid things that we think--
she was my baby .
are so important .
i guess all told , we had about 50 chickens .
maybe 115 head of hogs .
let &apos;s see , 55 cattle .
oh , you know what &apos;ll be fun ?
let &apos;s see if i can remember all their names . there was ...
albert , lisa
steph , and mike
gloria ! no , gloria !
gloria !
no . i do not want to hear one more story .
i am going to take a nap now .
okay , yeah , sure . whatever you want .
this day &apos;s about you .
just one more thing--
no , no one more thing !
i just wanted to take a picture , you know ,
to commemorate our special day .
okay , fine ! take the picture !
no , not here . the lighting &apos;s terrible .
i was thinking we could take it ...
in your new nursery !
no , cam . no .
but , gloria , come--
somebody has to tell you this . no .
you try to control everything . you take over people &apos;s lives !
it &apos;s always too much with you !
you know , maybe we should talk about this out in the hallway .
why , because there &apos;s gonna be better lighting over there ?
you &apos;re doing it again , cam . you &apos;re doing it again !
you &apos;re right . i am too much .
i do control . i do barge .
i &apos;ll have my friend abelard come back and paint over it .
so this is why you kept me outside all day ?
so that your friend aburar could come and paint a present ?
yeah , rather than getting you a gift off your registry
like a normal person .
i &apos;m so stupid .
i love it !
you do ?
it &apos;s just like you--
full of color ... and life ... and love .
i really did think you &apos;d love it .
what &apos;s going on up here ?
what the ...
okay , that was not my idea . i told cam--
i told him that &apos;s a lot to put on someone &apos;s wall .
hold on . i like it .
really ? oh ...
thanks , cam .
you actually--
makes it easier to give up the room .
wow , that &apos;s close .
guy was an inch out of bounds .
time @-@ out .
you know what ?
i &apos;m not gonna be able to relax
until i get this out of the way .
dishwasher .
pretty cool , huh ?
yeah . it is .
hey , do you think ...
mind if i freshen this ?
yeah , yeah , yeah . allow me .
wow . your hand &apos;s shaking .
remember , dave , it &apos;s just a game .
oh , god ! oh , my god ! my gosh .
oh , come here .
it &apos;s all right .
i &apos;m--i &apos;m just a little wet .
oh , no , you &apos;re drenched .
you can &apos;t sit in that . you know what ?
take that off . i &apos;ll throw &apos; em both in the dryer
and get us a couple of clean ones .
okay .
well , i guess this is something we &apos;re doing .
interception !
interception !
come on , buddy !
come on !
come on , buddy !
come on !
come on ! come on , buddy ! touchdown !
how exciting is this ? !
oh , it &apos;s been so long .
what &apos;s happening ?
uhh . nothing .
oh , my car keys .
shoot . the tv went off .
must have screwed something up .
you know what ? it doesn &apos;t matter .
there &apos;s another one upstairs .
how about we head up to the bedroom
for some halftime festivities ?
oh ... okay .
let &apos;s do this .
i &apos;d forgotten how much fun this can be .
we should make this a regular thing .
phil , phil , wait .
uh , i think i &apos;d better just head home .
what ?
i &apos;m just coming out of a long @-@ term relationship ,
and i guess i &apos;m still pretty fragile .
it &apos;s not that i haven &apos;t had a @-@ a great time .
not at all . hey , i get it .
i &apos;ve spent a few nights in heartbreak hotel .
if there &apos;s anything i can do ...
you &apos;ve already done more than you know .
