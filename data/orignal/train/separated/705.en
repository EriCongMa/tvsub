I want to make you a lot of money, Louise. Trust me.
Your mother came to see me last night.
What did she want?
A loan.
Now she owes me.
Did you get a look at his face?
I could barely make out anything
before he jumped off the balcony.
It is true that David Clarke is alive.
Em.
Are you ready to make an I.D.?
No.
Conrad Grayson faked my death,
and then he locked me away.
We ask for privacy so that David can be with his family.
She got to him first.
You were right.
They're not gonna leave me alone.
Which is why I didn't want you to come here.
I needed to see it for myself.
I'm not fighting with you, David.
I'm simply concerned for you.
Still edgy after the FBI debriefings.
It wasn't easy going over the past 10 years.
I'm so sorry you had to endure that.
I'm grateful that you --
that you were in D.C. with me this week...
...And for confirming what I said.
They're on the move.
No one will ever know what happened to Conrad.
I promise, David.
Can you imagine the headlines if they did?
And we thought we'd create a scandal running away together.
Remember?
Seems like a lifetime ago.
Yes, it does.
I used to think about that day on the beach.
It helped keep me sane when I was...about to break.
I used to imagine our life if we had gotten away.
This time, we will.
I promise.
Hey. Emily.
Those may be fists of fury,
but they're still made of flesh and bone.
Go easy.
Five days, I've been forced to watch my father on TV
while Victoria hasn't left his side.
Yeah, and it's not your fault that she got to him first.
Is that supposed to make me feel better?
I know how fragile a person's mind is
after enduring that kind of torture.
It's exactly the kind of leverage Victoria needs to manipulate him.
And...they just got back from D.C.
She took him to Amanda's grave?
Ems...
Look at what she's doing, Nolan!
We have to get him away from her.
Yeah, I know, and it pisses me off, too.
He was like a father to me.
He is my father.
And he clearly doesn't know that,
which means she hasn't told him.
I mean, we don't know what angle Victoria is playing yet.
I'll take the risk.
The last time you were in a room with your father,
he tried to kill you.
He wasn't coming for me, Nolan.
He was probably looking for Conrad.
Probably.
But it still proves that he is not the man that he once was.
Emily, what if it's worse than we think?
What if Conrad did break him?
Jack, any word from David?
Have you talked to your father-in-law yet?
Guys, stay on the sidewalk. I got a kid inside.
When is David gonna meet his grandson?
Are you afraid he's upset with you
for not protecting Amanda?
Do you think he blames you for the death of his daughter?
Get the hell off my property now!
Now! Both of you!
Victoria, it's Margaux again.
I understand you do not wish to speak with the media,
but we are family, so please... trust me.
Call me back.
You won't hear from her.
She's gonna keep working this three-ring circus
like P.T. Barnum in stilettos.
While I watch from the stands along with everyone else...
Despite the fact that she owes me
and, not to mention, our connection.
Yeah, a connection no one knows about.
Take my advice... keep it that way.
Why?
What happened with David was Conrad's crime, not yours.
To the public, we Graysons are all the same.
Why do you think I haven't been able
to land a client, other than Louise Ellis?
I can help you, Daniel.
Tell your side, change people's opinions.
No, no, no. No press.
I have to do this my way.
Listen, when I was with Emily,
we lived in the headlines, and that was a mistake.
The less people know about you,
the more control you have over your own life.
Is that why you're so secretive about this Louise girl?
Yeah. I can't afford to blow this.
She's that valuable?
I'm still counting the zeroes in her portfolio.
And by some miracle,
she chose me to handle her account.
And I just got to prove that she didn't make a mistake.
Then you know what you must do...
Keep her happy.
David!
Someone just tried to run over David Clarke.
David!
Do they know who did this?
No. No.
They found the car three blocks away.
It was stolen. It's a dead end.
They've offered me police protection
until they catch the guy.
David, we must get you to safety.
Now, I've already talked to a friend of mine
who has an estate in Maryland,
No, I'm not going anywhere.
And they're willing
to allow us to use it, David.
Why would you stay here? It's not safe.
All these stories I hear about Amanda --
nothing really makes sense.
I'd gone to her grave today hoping for some closure,
and it just raised more questions.
I fear you won't like the answers.
I don't care.
I am gonna find out what really happened to my girl.
Victoria was behind this. I'm sure of it.
She's terrified that my father will learn the truth about her,
so she put a police line between us.
Well, it definitely sounds like her shade of bitch.
Which is why you have to be extra-careful,
because now the hotel is crawling with cops and press.
You think that's gonna stop me?
You know what?
Maybe if Aiden were here, he could make you see it.
But he's not, so you have to listen to me.
Victoria's gunning for you,
and she's thought all of this through
with the same precision you usually do.
So before you make a mistake, slow down.
I can't, okay?
Don't you understand, Nolan?
I never went to see him in prison.
All of these years, he believed that his daughter hated him,
and I've lived with that guilt every single day.
Now I have the chance to make it right,
to let him know that his daughter still loves him,
so please, stop fighting me.
Of course.
Of course, kiddo.
I'm sorry.
It's just...
Vicky's done a hell of a job clarke-blocking us.
Only family can get through, and...You don't qualify.
At least, not yet.
Porter. Go home.
But I'm on the roster.
This is about David Clarke, isn't it?
Tough to do your job when reporters are tailing you.
I need you to sit this one out... just till it blows over.
Yeah. Sure, chief.
I saw you got ambushed this morning.
You all right?
I'm dying to get out there today.
Can't stand sitting around, feeling useless.
Imagine all this has got to bring up
some pretty heavy stuff for you, yeah?
It's always there in the back of my mind,
but now every jerk with a microphone's asking me about it.
"What happened to your brother, to Amanda?"
How did you make it through all that?
I almost didn't.
For a while, I thought that God had it out for me.
Turns out, it wasn't God at all...
Just a man who thought he was,
not giving a damn about who he hurt or who died.
Son of a bitch got what he deserved.
Well, the world seems to agree with you, but still...
I mean, a case that high-profile just gathering dust?
It's a little weird, don't you think?
Well, maybe it's 'cause people can see it for what it is...
Justice.
Ah! Danny! You made it!
Is this your first business meeting in a dress shop?
Pretty... pretty sure it is, yeah.
Although, next time,
you might want to choose someplace more private.
My family is still the top story.
They don't bother me.
I'm from the south, dear.
If they are not gossiping about you,
you might as well be dead.
Maybe I like to maintain a little mystery about myself.
Well, I'm still trying to figure you out,
so mission accomplished.
Which part are you trying to f-figure out, exactly?
Well, you and your mama, for starters.
Why the feud?
Oh, there's no mystery.
She's a control freak.
I got tired of her
injecting herself into every aspect of my life.
Hmm. Even your love life?
Especially that.
You want my mom's attention, date me.
Noted.
Too much?
Or "Hot damn"?
Definitely "Hot damn."
So, tell me, Danny,
am I wasting all my top-notch flirting on you?
Is there a...Prim new york girl waiting at home?
No.
No, there's not.
Of course you'd be here.
I need your help.
Why would I ever help you?
Our problems are not the issue right now. Our father is.
Please...I need to see him alone.
Why don't you just scale the building, knock down the door?
I doubt a little police barricade can stop you.
I would do that, but that's not exactly
how I want to reunite with our father.
Oh I get it, so you want me
to pave the way
for your triumphant return.
I think I'll pass.
Are you sure you want to side with your mother on this?
Who do you think was behind the attack today?
No. She loves David. She would never hurt him.
Charlotte.
You and I both know that your mother would do
whatever it takes to get what she wants,
including putting our father's life at risk.
She is manipulating him.
God, Charlotte,
she took him to what was supposed to be my grave.
Do you know how painful that must have been for him?
We have to stop her.
Please. I just want to tell him the truth.
Mother, you need to tell me the truth.
Were you behind the attack on David?
How could you think I would do such a thing?
I do not threaten the people I love
to get what I want.
You are so blind,
you can't even see you're using him.
You took him to that grave?! What's wrong with you?!
Your father demanded to go there against my wishes.
Do you think I enjoy watching him suffer?
Then why not just tell him the truth?
That's all Emily wants to do.
Emily. Well.
She is manipulating you, Charlotte.
That is what she does...she lies.
And when that doesn't work,
she resorts to violence and fear.
If she'd only told me the truth when she first arrived,
the girl in that grave would be alive today,
and so would Declan.
All right, Mr. Clarke. I'll be right outside.
Charlotte.
Oh. Dad.
It's all right. It's all right.
Charlotte, what is it?
If there's, uh, something you need to tell me, you can.
Actually, Dad, there's someone you need to meet.
I became a cop to get control of my life.
And now I can feel it all slipping away again,
and I hate that it's ...
Man, I'm sorry I'm going on like this.
You're not the only Mcmurphy in this cuckoo's nest.
I mean, David was the father that I always wanted.
When I thought he was killed, I fell apart.
But now he's back, and there is a part of me
that just wants to go to him.
Well, every part of me
wants to stay as far away from him as possible.
'Cause of Carl?
David thinks that my son is his grandchild.
What would I even say to him?
I can't imagine lying about something like that.
Personally, I'm glad the truth's finally coming out.
I wish I felt the same.
What do you mean?
Emily has been so focused on getting to David
that she's not thinking through all the variables.
Well, can you blame her? It's her father.
Jack, I know.
But... I'm afraid she's rushing
to meet a man that doesn't exist anymore.
And I don't know what that's gonna do to her.
What are you doing?
Are you selling access to David Clarke?
Maybe sneak in a camera, get some stolen footage?
Um, I'm sorry. I didn't
Get out of here.
I expect better from you.
What? You truly believe others out there are not doing the same?
And that makes it right?
It makes it reality.
You know, some of us have a job to do.
That's why I'm here, but why are you?
I am fightin for Amanda Clarke.
She wanted her father's name cleared
and her enemies brought to justice,
But what she didn't want
was for him to be used by people like you.
You should learn to govern your emotions, Emily.
This is such an unflattering color on you.
上来
People think the secret's in the copper mug.
It's actually the extra vodka.
To... Getting what you want.
I'll drink to that, neighbor.
Mm. Temporary neighbor.
I'm having my yacht brought from Hilton head.
A hotel's not an appropriate place to call home.
You calling me inappropriate?
Well, I don't know.
But it does reveal quite a bit about you.
I mean, look around, Danny.
No personal items.
Nothing to remind you of your family
or where you come from.
You are a man in search of an identity.
And you clearly haven't settled on one yet.
You're unlike anyone I've ever met.
Well, multiple rounds of electroshock therapy
will do that to a girl.
I just haven't figured you out yet, either.
Now, which part are you trying to figure out, exactly?
Is something the matter?
Because... Unless I'm sorely mistaken,
you're just as attracted to me as I am to you.
So, tell me, Daniel Grayson...
What do you want?
Jack.
I thought it was time
David was finally reunited with his son-in-law.
Hello, Jack.
Uh, come in.
Charlotte said you would be joining me.
Do come in. We have so much to discuss.
Where the hell is my father?
And what exactly is your plan once you do find him, Emily?
You know damn well,
which is why you're so desperate to turn him against me.
I will not destroy the memory of his child.
You may have that honor, if you truly are that cruel.
You want to talk "Cruel," Victoria?
How about ripping a child away from her father
or bribing a doctor
into poisoning every good memory she ever had of him?
That is the truth that you're running from.
Now tell me where my father is.
Or you'll what?
Come after my children again?
Or am I to be the next victim in your growing body count?
Oh, that, I could live with.
But could your father?
Have you ever considered what will happen
When you tell him about all your lies
or the death you caused in his name, hmm?
I wonder what he'll feel.
Guilt?
Shame?
Your plan was perfect, Emily, save for one detail...
Your father is alive.
And now you must live with the repercussions of what you've done.
And so will you.
I'll make sure of it.
Then tell him.
Or stay hidden in this pathetic identity.
Either way, it will be tremendous fun to watch.
You can show yourself out.
You know what I see?
Is just a frightened woman
about to lose the last person
she could ever trick into loving her
to his daughter.
David, it's...really great to see you again,
but I'm afraid we were just on our way out.
Carl has a checkup.
You can't. David has to meet his grandson.
Of course.
Hey there, big man.
I'm your grandpa.
It's the first time I've ever said that.
He has her eyes, don't you think?
It's hard for me to remember.
I'll get the wedding album.
There's some great closeup shots of Amanda. You'll see it.
It's a nice home you've made for yourself here, Jack.
I just wish Amanda could have seen this place.
She always wanted a house like this.
Where did you two live?
Down on the waterfront.
Remember the Stowaway?
The-the bar?
They lived above it.
It was nicer than it sounds, small, but cozy.
Here's Amanda.
Oh, yeah.
He does have her eyes.
I'm sorry, guys.
I really need to get Carl to this doctor's apartment.
Yeah, of course. Jack, thank you so much.
You know, it's clear to me
that you've grown up to be an honorable man.
Yeah, Jack's one of the good guys.
I could get in a lot of trouble
if someone finds out I gave you this.
You don't have clearance, Ben. It's a federal case.
Yeah, one they aren't any closer to solving, either.
Figure, why not take a shot at it myself?
And make detective, right? That mean you got a lead?
I got a suspect with motive.
David.
I want to talk to you.
Of course.
Come in. Come in.
No police?
No, they're waiting outside. I wanted some privacy.
Right.
Well, I-I knew you'd have questions about Amanda.
Did you give her the money or the box that I made her?
Did she ever get the journals?
I gave her everything the day she got out,
everything that you asked.
Then why was she living above a bar?
Because...
I know.
You're hearing a lot of crazy things about Amanda right now--
some of them from people you may even think you trust.
I hope you won't take their word as fact.
I hope that you will trust
what you know in your heart to be true.
But that's the problem, Nolan.
See, the more I hear,
the harder it is for me to remember my little girl.
She's slipping away from me.
And that scares the hell out of me.
Figured you'd be here.
Guess it was a bad day all around.
I went to see my father,
and Victoria was waiting for me instead.
I'm not thinking this through properly.
Nolan was right. He warned me not to go.
I doubt there's a person alive who could have stopped you.
Well, you're probably right.
Jack, do you think my father's gonna hate me
for everything I've done?
Stop it.
That's just Victoria getting inside your head.
No, it's not.
You need to have faith in him, Emily.
Trust me, a father never stops loving their child.
People died in his name.
My father never would have wanted that.
Yes, but they started it.
You did what you had to do to stop them.
No one knows that better than me.
Because you were there.
But how am I gonna get him to understand
if I can't even get to him?
Victoria can twist the truth, all of it.
No. She can't.
I know, cause I was just with David.
What?
Yes.
He's afraid,
mainly of losing touch
with the memory of you, Emily.
And the good news is,
he hasn't given up on his daughter.
There is still a chance that you can connect with him.
You need to get David away from her.
I need to bring my father
back to a time that Victoria can't touch,
when it was just the two of us in this house.
My father needs Amanda Clarke.
If you've come here to do battle,
I must warn you, I have an 11:30,
so please be concise.
I am not here to argue.
In fact, I came to apologize for yesterday.
I don't always think clearly when it comes to Amanda.
Then let me assure you,
I have no interest in exploiting her father.
I know.
You're a good person, Margaux.
That became clear to me when you cut ties with Daniel.
So, what brings you by, Emily?
I want to do something for David,
something that I believe will aid in his recovery
and might also give you
a way around Victoria's media blackout.
Forgive me, but how would that work?
You and Victoria seem to have quite--
A strained relationship?
That's a nice way of putting it.
Well, see, that's where you come in.
Obviously, Victoria would never accept a gesture from me,
so it's vital that my name be kept out of the story --
that is, if you're willing to take full credit.
I was wondering when you'd show up.
Want a drink?
What the hell do you think you were pulling yesterday?
Wow. You are not a very good cop.
Terrible deductive reasoning.
So this is all just some sick joke
to you and your mother -- is that it?
No. She had nothing to do with my visit.
What if I'd told David the truth?
And expose Emily?
Not a chance.
You're a coward, Jack -- a joke.
We're done here.
You know, I came here thinking
you were just some kid pretending to be her mother.
You're not Victoria. You're worse.
You're Conrad..
I'm nothing like him.
You're doing exactly what he did.
You are torturing David. And for what?
Some pathetic power trip over me?
He's your father, Charlotte.
No wonder you have to hide behind all that crap.
How else could you live with yourself?
You worked the Grayson kidnapping, right?
Yeah. I was there when Porter got arrested.
Why are you asking?
Well, he's my partner.
Just want to know what kind of man he is.
And you were there for the questioning?
Yeah.
Yeah, Reyes grilled him for hours.
She was sure he was guilty.
She figured Porter planned it all --
you know, grabbed the girl,
planted the camera on her, took Grayson down.
I never bought it.
Why not?
I mean, Grayson killed his wife and his brother.
Whoever pulled that off wasn't the owner of some dive bar.
An operation like that takes money.
So you never looked at Porter for the murder, huh?
He was in with Reyes and me when Grayson got whacked.
Best alibi a guy could have.
Right.
Daniel? Are you here?
You haven't been returning any of my calls.
I'm working.
Well, I may have something
that can help you even more than Louise Ellis.
Margaux, I don't ask about your work,
so stay out of mine.
Don't push me away -- not this time.
You may not see it yet,
but I know we're better together than apart.
I would have never been able to take on Gideon without you.
And now I have found a way
to put your father's scandal behind you --
forever.
But you have to trust me.
Everou got to do, just do it without me.
Daniel, this isn't charity.
It's simply good business --
for both of us.
Where is the police?
I sent them away. I don't want them anymore.
They still haven't found the driver of that car, David.
It's too dangerous.
I was a prisoner for 20 years.
I won't live like one anymore.
David.
You need to trust me when I tell you that you need protection.
Not everybody here has your best interests at heart.
Y-you're not the first person
to say something like that to me.
And it's, making me wonder
who I can trust and who I shouldn't.
Something is not right here.
Mr. Clarke.
Daniel?
Look at you.
Daniel, this isn't a good time right now.
Listen, I'm...
sorry to stop by unannounced.
I just needed to come here today
to personally apologize for what was done to you.
You weren't responsible.
No, still, what my father did defies words,
and reparations need to be made.
That's the deed to your beach house.
Consider it my gift to you.
What are you doing?
A toning for my father's sins.
David, I've already lined up a place for us.
This was my home.
This -- this is what I want.
Emily would never sell to you.
Now, how did you get the deed to this house?
She didn't know I was involved.
I refuse to allow you to use David.
See, I thought you might say that,
so I took a few precautions.
Cat's out of the bag now.
Just smile for the cameras.
Don't want to cause a scene, do you?
David. Hey, this is Margaux Lemarchal.
She heads up...
Lemarchal media. Yes, I-I know who she is.
Do you mind explaining the cameras?
Well, Daniel thought we could contain the gossip
if someone he trusted covered this story.
Let's just go outside.
No, it won't take long.
David, are you comfortable with this?
I am.
Just stick to the questions.
Then I'm happy for you.
This is your home.
You got your father away from Victoria.
Although Daniel and Margaux is a twist I didn't see coming.
Now I know Margaux isn't truly an ally,
she really is her father's daughter.
Shacking up with the son of Conrad, no less.
So, what do we call them?
Maniel?
Dangaux?
Trouble.
That parlor trick you pulled with Daniel tonight
disappointed me, Margaux.
Oh, I'm sorry you feel that way.
I will not allow you to use David like that again.
Well, then, perhaps we should come to an arrangement --
one with less opportunity for surprises.
Give me exclusive rights to David's story.
Consider it repayment of your debt.
I can't speak for David, Margaux.
You know better than that.
But I may be able to facilitate such an arrangement
provided you give us final approval on all stories.
I cannot do that.
Well, that's unfortunate.
As you know, your competitors have approached me.
Who knows what one of the more tenacious reporters
might uncover in their own investigation --
Maybe even your family's connection to the scandal.
And lacking any personal relationship with them,
I may be powerless to stop it.
You would never allow anyone
to tarnish the memory of your Pascal.
Perhaps you're right.
Do feel free to call my bluff.
Victoria.
We have a deal.
Oh, no, no. It's the least that I could do.
I mean, poor guy has really suffered.
Well, yeah, I'd love to meet tomorrow.
Keith, let me call you back.
Saw you on TV with that Lemarchal girl.
You two looked cozy.
So I asked around, and the concierge says
she's been sneaking up here for days.
You lied to me, Daniel.
You're right.
I did lie to you.
And to myself.
You were right about me, Louise.
I've been trying to figure out who I am.
And for a minute, I thought I could be
the guy I was with you yesterday, but...
Today, I was reminded that I'm part of a team,
and we're damn good together.
And what does that mean for me?
Well, you hired me to protect you and your interests,
so that's what I plan on doing from now on.
Unless you're not comfortable with me,
and if that's the case, then we'll go our separate ways.
It's your call.
Why would I go with anyone but you?
Fantastic.
Listen, we are gonna make a ton of money together, Louise.
Tomorrow, you and I start over.
We keep things strictly professional.
And trust me -- I'm doing you a favor.
I mean, you really don't want to be a part of my family.
Yes, hello.
Please connect me to Page Six.
I have a story about Daniel Grayson.
Did you think you could pull that file
without my finding out?
You're a beat cop, Hunter.
You got no business kicking that nest.
Yeah, well, someone should, chief.
Come on -- Conrad Grayson gets killed
days after being exposed for masterminding Flight 197,
and the case is still open?
So... you close it?
No. My suspect has an alibi.
I get you're hungry, Ben. I really do.
And someday, you'll make detective,
but it will not be on this case.
Now... hand over the file.
Trust me --
nothing good comes from this.
Daddy!!
You're making a mistake! You're making a mistake!!
Let go of her! Leave her alone!
To your father's return home.
So, when are you gonna tell him?
When he's ready.
Why wait?
I thought that was the whole point of getting him next door.
This isn't about me, Nolan. It's about helping him.
After what he's been through, my father needs time to recover.
I want to win him back honestly -- with the truth.
And when he's ready, I'll make sure that he knows that...
I'm still here.
We used to dance to this.
It was his favorite.
Are you ready?
How did she get this song to play on cue?
Remote control? Motion sensor?
She didn't need any of that.
She just had to get him back home.
What did you say your name was, again?
Oh, never mind. It doesn't matter.
You're going pretty hard tonight.
I don't want to think anything.
I don't want to feel anything.
Well, in that case,
I got just what you need back at my place.
Then, what are we still doing here?
Never thought I'd be going home with Charlotte Grayson.
I have come to learn...
It's "Clarke."
that evil takes many forms...
My mistake.
...including those that we think we can trust the most.
The anger this bred almost cost me
the thing that I valued above all else --
my memories of you,
the daughter I still love
infinity times infinity.
But now I can feel you again,
which is why I know what I must do,
for you were wronged, as I was,
and by someone I trusted.
There must be repercussions.
And I swear to you, Amanda...
I will have revenge.
