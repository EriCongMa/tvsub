you -- you all right , son ?
are you hurt ?
son , do you need help ?
what &apos;s this ?
a trust account for your child .
i @-@ i can &apos;t take this .
i &apos;m sorry .
when i was young ,
i loved fairy tales .
i was always partial to shapeshifters ,
who seemed good and sweet ,
but they were full of unimaginable darkness .
once upon a time , there lived a woman in the woods .
she was neither purely evil , nor purely good .
she gathered unwanted children
and gave them a home in which to stay .
she promised them they &apos;d live forever and a day .
she changed them into colors , so beautiful , so bold .
she cared for them so sweetly , they never grew old .
you know it .
lady ambrosia .
always creeped me out .
i &apos;m more of a &quot; wizard of oz &quot; fan .
you just can &apos;t beat a farm girl in great shoes .
every culture has their version
of a mythic creature who takes children .
the germans have der grossmann , the mexicans -- la llorona .
but there are whispers that lady ambrosia is not a myth ,
that there &apos;s a real woman out there --
takes unwanted children and raises them
with the promise of eternal youth .
this little boy turned up out of nowhere yesterday ,
and i wonder if lady ambrosia played any part
认定死亡的男孩被发现安然无恙
in his disappearance .
missing children turn up .
he wasn &apos;t missing .
he died four years ago .
and he &apos;s not the first .

i love annapolis .
i had a friend who went to the naval academy ,
and we used to go to this little italian restaurant , marias ,
on the water .
is it even still open ?
i don &apos;t think we know it .
beside the point .
anyway , um ,
it seems like a lovely place to raise a child .
it really is .
we &apos;ve got great schools , a lot of outdoor activities .
oh , there &apos;s this -- this tall ship in --
it looks like a pirate ship .
it &apos;s in the harbor . uh , we take my niece .
she is obsessed with it .
can i be honest ?
i like you guys a lot ,
and you &apos;re probably too polite to ask about it ,
but you do know about my past ?
yeah . we do .
all we want is a healthy baby .
and we know that , with this process , there are compromises .
i &apos;m sure if we work together , we can come up with a plan .
but i have gotten my hopes up before ,
so i just want to make sure you &apos;re completely comfortable
with me being a part of my child--
our child &apos;s life .
three children , all missing and presumed dead .
mary jones died on a family camping trip in 2003 .
jeffrey childs disappeared from his backyard two years later .
in 2012 , ethan linley drowned on the ohio river .
all three were later found alive .
all three had traces of these ritualistic patterns
painted on their bodies .
were they able to explain what had happened ?
identify their captors ?
no . jones was also autistic , and childs was blind .
can you zoom in any closer on the pattern on ethan &apos;s body ?
hang on .
okay .
they don &apos;t look like strokes from a paintbrush .
it looks like finger painting .
check with his doctor .
if navabi &apos;s right ,
lift the prints from the finger paint in the photos
and run them .
ressler , take keen to that hospital .
i want a psych eval on the kid .
agent ressler ?
judy sickler , child services .
this is elizabeth keen .
she &apos;s a clinical psychologist .
she &apos;ll be assessing the child .
well , that might be tricky .
he &apos;s a sweet boy , but nonverbal .
i understand he &apos;s autistic .
is there any sign of abuse ?
aside from a few bumps and bruises ,
being a little dehydrated , he got a perfect bill of health .
hi , ethan . i &apos;m liz .
i &apos;m here to help .
okay , how are you feeling ?
how do you feel ?
don &apos;t think you &apos;re gonna get that back .
first thing he &apos;s been excited about all day .
i can &apos;t believe that he &apos;s here .
ethan .
it &apos;s me .
it &apos;s dad .
i just -- i -- i @-@ i @-@ i don &apos;t understand .
where did you find him ?
the cops won &apos;t tell us anything .
they &apos;re still investigating ,
but , uh , we &apos;ll give you two a moment .
i can &apos;t imagine what it must have been like
for them all these years ,
thinking their child was dead .
what is it ? what &apos;s wrong ?
it &apos;s aram .
apparently , two weeks before ethan disappeared ,
the linleys tried to give him up for adoption .
all right , children ,
who else is excited to celebrate matthew today ?
everybody ?
yay !
all right , children , let &apos;s stop here .
my little angels , this is where it begins .
we &apos;re going to celebrate who ?
matthew !
&apos;cause don &apos;t you know it &apos;s matthew &apos;s day ?
he &apos;ll be safe and always play .
today &apos;s the day he learns to ...
fly !
he &apos;ll be so happy in the ...
sky !
and then what &apos;s he going to be in the sky ?
a butterfly !
a beautiful butterfly .
whoo , matthew ! yay !
matthew !
bye @-@ bye !
how beautiful ! how many butterflies ?
how many ? can you count them ?
so beautiful !
here we go !
here we go !
i know what you &apos;ve done , theodore .
i know what you &apos;ve done .
ethan linley disappeared on may 20 , 2012 .
in the six months before he &quot; passed away , &quot;
his parents met with four different adoption agencies .
ethan apparently requires around @-@ the @-@ clock care --
medical therapy , speech and language therapy .
in fact , jeanne quit her job
to be ethan &apos;s full @-@ time caregiver .
my cousin has special needs .
the burden it places on his parents --
the way they deal with it is incredible .
i &apos;m not saying it &apos;s easy ,
but i &apos;d never give up my kid for adoption .
people give their kids up for all kinds of reasons .
investigators may have talked to the linleys
about adopting out ethan ,
but i doubt they spoke with adoption agencies .
question them . see what they know .
get warrants .
there &apos;s something these parents aren &apos;t telling us .
number 48 .
how you doing ?
i &apos;ve seen you before .
i doubt it .
yes , it &apos;s you .
i know i know you from my spin class , right ?
hot stuff .
i think you have me mistaken for somebody else .
no , no . you are one kooky little white man .
i &apos;m telling you , when calvin plays donna summer --
you just go .
i &apos;ll tell you .
now , you know all the girls in class got a crush on you , right ?
especially me -- i think you &apos;re really sexy .
thank you .
so , you want to get some food after this , hot stuff ?
like i said , i think you have me mistaken for somebody else .
lookin &apos; for some hot stuff , baby , this evening .
i need some hot stuff , baby , tonight .
come on . we could have some fun .
i bet we could .
i need some hot stuff , baby , this evenin &apos; .
come on .
45 minutes , glen ?
45 minutes .
make it quick .
i &apos;m meeting trudy for a nooner at the old colony inn .
vasilia patinka , former kgb --
i need you to find her .
it &apos;ll take time .
i &apos;m stacked up .
stacked up ?
employee training is always 1st of the month .
we &apos;re getting the parking lot re @-@ striped .
i got to get the cones .
i got to book the deejay for the new year &apos;s party .
it &apos;s february .
always thinking ahead , hot stuff .
i do not wait for 45 minutes
in that petri dish of humanity
unless i absolutely have to .
this is a matter of life and death , glen .
so &apos;s my nooner with trudy .
as the french say , la petite mort .
if you find this woman , if you get it done fast ,
your tawdry liaisons at the no @-@ tell motel
will be a thing of the past ,
as i will personally introduce you
to two young ladies you will never forget --
soft , warm , blond , and willing .
willing ?
tell trudy you have to cancel .
noah .
it &apos;s jeanne linley .
have you heard about ethan ?
he &apos;s back .
you told me that he would never be found ,
and now he just ... shows up ?
calm down . i @-@ it &apos;s gonna be fine .
calm down ?
i didn &apos;t work directly with the linleys --
noah shuster did .
could we speak with him ?
i have to go .
we need to talk .
you know where to meet me . one hour .
we &apos;ll figure this all out .
noah finds homes for children who are difficult to place --
kids with emotional disturbances ,
special needs , health issues .
that &apos;s strange . he was just here .
do you have a home address , contact information ?
yes , of course .
client information is privileged .
not anymore .
they said yes ?
open adoption -- you can have qualified contact --
everything we wanted .
it &apos;s great , and i can &apos;t thank you enough .
this is really gonna happen .
um , i &apos;m -- i &apos;m sorry .
um , hang on just a sec .
liz ! liz , it &apos;s me !
tom , where are you ?
listen , it &apos;s all good !
i figured out another way to make some cash .
boys , we &apos;re here .
you can celebrate later . we have work to do .
tell the ball and chain you &apos;ll call her back .
what &apos;s going on ?
no , all you need to know right now
is that everything is gonna be fine , all right ?
we are free .
from what ?
reddington -- all of it .
and , look , don &apos;t make any moves on the adoption .
tom , what have you done ?
i &apos;ll meet you at your place tomorrow night .
i &apos;ll bring wing yee &apos;s ,
and i &apos;ll explain everything , all right ?
i got a good feeling .
i got to go .
i know you like to watch .
you could have called anybody to do the job with ,
but you called me .
you need me .
we need each other .
come with me to zurich , right now .
gina ...
i can &apos;t .
freezing out there . hop in .
♬ i still remember ♬
i &apos;m so sorry about all of this .
i don &apos;t need an apology , noah .
i want to know how this happened .
that does nothing to solve the issue at hand .
what &apos;s important is that we come up with a solution .
now .
now wha--
♬ a few simple changes ♬
♬ and i needed no one but you ♬
make her go to sleep .
♬ what can i do ? ♬
♬ i turned around , i &apos;m alone ♬
♬ now the sun don &apos;t shine ♬
♬ life &apos;s a waste of time since you turned me away ♬
♬ oh , how i tried ♬
♬ to hold on to you ♬
♬ and i hope , love ♬
i think mother hurts the children .
♬ that you will come home , love ♬
i don &apos;t think she turns them into butterflies .
come up here .
♬ it &apos;s all i can do ♬
♬ life is no good without you ♬
you need to stop questioning your mother .
you let ethan get away .
now you need to help us clean this mess up .
do you understand ?
♬ life &apos;s a waste of time since you turned me away ♬
sorry , dad .
it &apos;s me , again .
where are you ?
please call me when you get this .
mr. linley .
this is agent navabi .
you need to come with us .
why ? is something wrong ?
noah shuster .
i don &apos;t know who that is . what &apos;s going on ?
he was the adoption agent
that you and your wife met about ethan .
the day after he disappeared ,
$ 25,000 from one of your accounts was transferred to his .
that &apos;s ridiculous . i never --
sir , you &apos;re gonna have to come with us .
i- i can &apos;t . my wife is not here , all right ?
she said she was going out for coffee .
she hasn &apos;t come back .
i don &apos;t know what &apos;s happened to her .
now you want me to leave ethan alone ?
he &apos;ll be taken care of .
by who ?
come on .
you hungry ?
how do you feel about waffles ?
no toaster .
no microwave . no problem . no problem .
i know , the whole idea
that mozart will improve cognitive skills is a myth ,
but they say babies start learning in the womb ,
so , on the off chance it &apos;ll get him into harvard ...
it &apos;s okay , ethan ! it &apos;s okay !
it &apos;s just a smoke alarm . it &apos;s fine .
ethan ?
what happened ? is everything all right ?
what are you doing ? ! put that away !
what are you doing ? ! get out ! get out !
one last chance -- zurich .
you know i can &apos;t .
thanks , boys .
torch it . call me when it &apos;s done .
i want him gone .
he &apos;s here for your protection .
i don &apos;t want his protection any more than i want your money .
the money isn &apos;t for you .
it &apos;s very generous .
i can appreciate that it comes from a place of concern ,
but it &apos;s dirty money , and i just don &apos;t want it .
i don &apos;t need it .
no , but your child does .
i &apos;m giving my child up for adoption .
why would you do that ?
how can you , of all people , ask me that question ?
the life i have because of you is no place for a child .
i can &apos;t even make a waffle without one of your people
bursting into my home with a gun .
you think your life is too dangerous for a child .
but what is your life without one ?
i can tell you from personal experience -- not much .
what ?
you and tom agree on something .
he wants you to keep the baby ?
oh , yeah .
oh , my god . that &apos;s it .
the key to these abductions is parental consent .
no child can be adopted out without both parents agreeing .
so i had aram look over noah shuster &apos;s case files .
there were 93 cases , including ethan &apos;s ,
where parents considered adoption , then backed out .
of those , 16 kids died or went missing
within a year of the visit --
16 kids with cognitive , physical ,
or psychological issues .
according to ethan &apos;s father , adoption was his mother &apos;s idea .
he was working extra shifts
to pay for ethan &apos;s private school and therapies ,
leaving her alone with him .
he was trying to appease his wife by meeting with shuster ,
but he maintains that he never wanted to go through with it .
well , conveniently for him ,
she &apos;s not around to challenge his side of things .
no , but she had access to a personal trust account
from which she transferred money to shuster .
she could have paid him off ,
and he could have taken her to cover it up .
i think this lady ambrosia is using shuster
to identify mothers and fathers
who want to get rid of their kids
but can &apos;t because their spouses won &apos;t consent .
i searched the national child identification program ,
and of the prints we lifted
from the finger paint on ethan &apos;s body ,
seven of them belong to that group of missing children .
we need to find this noah shuster
and figure out where this city of lost kids is .
you lied to me !
we had a deal .
two ladies for you , one address for me .
ladies , the kind that walk on two legs , preferably hairless .
i want the address .
you think it &apos;s funny ? little dogs ?
i thought they &apos;d be a nice gesture .
i thought you &apos;d like them .
i don &apos;t like them .
or maybe you &apos;re afraid they won &apos;t like you .
dogs are very intuitive .
they &apos;ll know if you &apos;re hiding something .
i am hiding something -- i hate dogs .
they &apos;re homeless .
i &apos;ll call you when i decide to race the iditarod .
ah , you know what ? forget it .
just forget it . i &apos;ll take them back .
your friend vasilia patinka --
she &apos;s living under an alias in gaithersburg ,
1632 south perry drive .
what about the dogs ?
i love &apos; em .
taking an early lunch so we can hit the dog park .
these little marshmallows are gonna get my wienie roasted .
well , you are beautiful , anya .
it &apos;s magical work -- magical !
isn &apos;t anya going to make the most gorgeous butterfly ?
oh , well , it looks like someone &apos;s coming through our door .
we need to talk .
the grown @-@ ups will be right back .
help your friends .
it &apos;s gone too far .
the f.b.i. came to the office .
if they have ethan , if he leads them here ...
well , you can &apos;t let that happen .
you know , what we do matters .
unwanted children feel loved here .
we keep them safe until ...
we have to let them go .
now , you took care of ethan &apos;s mother .
you take care of him .
theo says you hurt them .
he knows .
he doesn &apos;t know . i can handle him .
can you handle ethan ?
oh , no .
agent ressler .
20 minutes ago ,
noah shuster logged into the dcfs website .
why wasn &apos;t his access denied ?
he searched for ethan , and in his file ,
his temporary emergency guardian is listed as --
jesus . call keen .
get units there now .
hello ?
noah shuster looked up ethan in the foster system
and found your address .
we think he &apos;s coming for the boy .
agent ressler &apos;s on his way .
ethan , i just realized
i don &apos;t have an extra toothbrush .
we &apos;re gonna have to go back to the store , okay ?
let &apos;s go .
drop it .
okay .
we &apos;re taking the boy .
ethan , run !
go now !
ethan ?
ethan ?
oh , thank god .
ethan , you can come out now . everything &apos;s okay .
you &apos;re safe now .
you &apos;re safe .
i wouldn &apos;t be here if it wasn &apos;t important .
how did you find me ?
what you endured , most people never recover from .
i doubt i would have .
but you &apos;ve turned it into a calling .
nikolai would be proud .
i never blamed him for what happened .
he blamed himself .
the glasnost files --
there &apos;s something in them i need to see .
that was another life .
one of the bravest men i ever knew was deaf --
zeeb pasha , a communist i shared a cell with
in a military prison outside ankara .
zeeb and i were interrogated by the &quot; k section &quot; --
foot whipping , hung by our wrists , electric shock .
i was nothing more than a groaning heap in the corner .
every time our guard passed the cell ,
zeeb would start signing .
his fingers were a blur --
pointing and tapping , twisting and swirling --
the same thing over and over again and again .
lo and behold , one night , our cell was left unlocked .
turns out the guard &apos;s daughter was deaf .
and old zeeb had been signing ,
&quot; my wife , my daughter , my life . &quot;
six words , unspoken ,
convinced that guard to let us go .
such a beautiful language .
like that girl just then --
what did she say to you on her way out ?
&quot; i &apos;m grateful for you . &quot;
the glasnost files .
i said no .
what if i could give you answers about your daughter ?
would that change your mind ?
the only thing that could change my mind
is you bringing her back .
but since that &apos;s not possible , the answer is no .
i don &apos;t care who you have approval from ,
i am not leaving ethan in your care .
i feel like i &apos;ve made a connection
with him on some level
and that he might tell me where he was being kept ,
where the other children are being held .
you need to say goodbye .
hey , ethan .
you &apos;re gonna go with miss sickler now ,
and she &apos;s gonna take you to a place that is so safe .
and you &apos;re gonna be surrounded by people who care about you .
and no one is ever gonna hurt you again .
okay ?
you took noah shuster ?
baz did , after he saved you .
what is your interest in this case ?
same as yours-- missing children .
brimley is in there ,
speaking to the only man who can tell us
where to find lady ambrosia .
i need to take butterscotch for a walk .
when i get back , i &apos;m gonna need some ground mineral salt
and a corded dremel drill .
come on , poopsie . let &apos;s go . that &apos;s it . very good .
when i said that baz saved you ,
i wasn &apos;t looking for a &quot; thank you . &quot;
i &apos;m just relieved .
i found a couple ...
to take the baby .
thinking about it is one thing , but actually doing it ...
how did she do it-- my mother ?
your parents loved each other very much .
the cold war was hard--
too hard for your father .
when the soviet union was collapsing , he took you from her .
she gave up everything to follow him , to follow you .
the night of the fire--
that &apos;s what they were arguing about ?
your mother , despite what he &apos;d done , she wanted him back .
she wanted them to be a family .
as much as it pains me to say it , he was probably ...
the only man she ever really loved .
and i shot him .
it was an accident .
tell me . i need to know .
your mother was never the same after that .
the man she loved killed by the child she adored--
it was ... just too much .
two months later , she went to cape may
and left her clothes on the beach ,
walked into the ocean , and was never seen again .
so , that night , i killed both my parents .
you were a child .
there should never have been a gun for you to grab .
looking back , i &apos;m not sure i shouldn &apos;t have
raised you myself .
i don &apos;t want you looking back with that kind of regret .
where are they ?
they &apos;re ugly , then they &apos;re beautiful .
answer me . where-- your father--
i &apos;m ugly .
where is he ?
he took him--
the man with the gun .
a policeman ?
oh , my god ! why don &apos;t you have answers for me ?
i thought that you made them beautiful
to keep them from being like me .
look , we have to talk about this later .
your job is to prepare anya .
he refuses to leave .
i didn &apos;t want to force him and make things worse .
i think he wants to speak with you .
hey , ethan .
can i come in ?
so you decided to stick around , huh ?
ethan , what is this ?
ethan drew this ?
isn &apos;t it amazing ?
look at the patterns on the wings .
they remind me of ...
the finger painting .
that &apos;s the same pattern that was painted on ethan
and the other two kids who escaped .
same dark edges , same spotting .
so whoever was holding these kids
was painting them like butterflies .
some sort of ritual ?
feniseca tarquinius --
also known as the harvester butterfly --
highly localized ,
related to a species found in africa and asia .
the only carnivorous butterfly in north america .
carnivorous ?
if there is a ritual , maybe it involves this species .
why would ethan want me to know that ?
track all sales of this species of larvae
for the past 12 months -- i want a location .
we need shuster , but reddington has him .
and , keen ... where the hell is reddington ?
i believe you abducted anya patinka .
where is she ?
if that &apos;s who you &apos;re looking for , you &apos;re too late .
it &apos;s her birthday .
i don &apos;t know what that means .
lady ambrosia -- she -- she means well .
by abducting children ?
no .
we always try to keep our process as humane as possible .
what process ?
what process ?
anya is turning 12 ...
the end of adolescence .
she &apos;ll be ... transformed .
we use nitrous .
and the children are happy , relaxed ,
euphoric f @-@ for their rebirth .
and the other children ?
they help prepare for the celebration
while the wrapping of the butterfly child continues .
where is she ?
we call it the colony --
an abandoned schoolhouse , route 2 south of richmond .
after our son died ...
she wanted to save other children .
s @-@ she turns them into butterflies ,
sets them free s @-@ so they can stay children forever .
okay . this is amazing .
uh , well , maybe not amazing .
i mean , how many people are in the market
for carnivorous butterfly larvae ?
aram .
okay , i tracked nine shipments in the last six months --
eight to sanctuaries , wildlife preserves , and zoos .
and the ninth ?
exactly .
oh , anya .
i know you can &apos;t hear me , but you &apos;re almost there .
you &apos;re almost home .
oh , bless you , child .
bless you .
anya patinka -- where is she ?
who the hell are you ?
her fairy godmother .
i hear it &apos;s her birthday . we &apos;ve come to celebrate .
it &apos;s been some time since freshman english ,
but i seem to recall that fairy tales
about abandonment , death , and witches
are supposed to allow children
to deal with their fears in symbolic terms .
but there &apos;s nothing symbolic about this place .
you &apos;re a real witch .
i don &apos;t know who you are ,
but if you don &apos;t get off my property right now ,
i &apos;ll call the police .
i believe they &apos;re already on their way .
while we &apos;re waiting , how about i tell you a story ?
it &apos;s about a mother , her two sons ,
and a canoeing accident .
you &apos;ve talked to noah .
the family lived by a river .
the boys often took a canoe out to fish .
one day , the canoe tipped .
inexplicably , the elder son , the golden child ,
the champion swimmer , drowned .
while the younger , the lesser child , survived .
the way noah tells it ,
you allowed theo to believe it was his fault ,
that he was the reason his brother died ,
that he would have been better off dead .
they could have died together ,
beautiful and innocent .
theo would have been spared all this .
by &quot; this , &quot; you mean ♬ the horror of being different .
is that why you kill them ?
i save them .
from what ?
i make sure the damaged ones
don &apos;t grow up to be outcasts like theo --
hated , pitied .
no one loves an outcast .
not even his mother ?
i couldn &apos;t send my son away ,
but when i look at him ,
i see what these children shouldn &apos;t be
and what they won &apos;t be .
because i see the life i save them from .
i &apos;m ugly .
from where i sit ,
there &apos;s only one ugly person in the room ,
and it &apos;s certainly not you , theo .
she &apos;s breathing . she &apos;ll be okay .
excellent . we must be going .
theo , you are entitled to as much as anyone --
happiness , joy ,
a mother &apos;s love .
theo , stop him .
stop him .
theo , what are you doing ? stop him !
theo .
theo .
theo , what -- oh , my god ! no !
no , theodore , what are you doing ? !
let me g--
let me go !
i &apos;m not asking !
theodore james !
let me go !
no !
follow me .
♬ here &apos;s another cold day ♬
♬ in that old november way ♬
♬ once again it &apos;s begin ♬
♬ i &apos;m stuck and out astray ♬
♬ and you came in like a wave ♬
hey , tom .
♬ just breathe ♬
i &apos;m just wondering where you are .
give me a call when you can .
♬ just breathe ♬
♬ and the gulp &apos;s from the gut ♬
anya ? anya !
♬ i &apos;m flat on the floor ♬
ohh , anya !
anya !
oh , baby !
♬ there &apos;s no use riding waves ♬
♬ crashed to the shore ♬
♬ through the same pale grin ♬
♬ i gave ♬
i still don &apos;t understand it --
reddington &apos;s interest in this case .
♬ i can just breathe ♬
what does he get ?
♬ just breathe ♬
♬ i can just breathe ♬
thank you .
♬ just breathe ♬
it just keeps getting worse .
&quot; &apos; how can i get there ? &apos; asked dorothy .
&apos;you must walk .
it is a long journey through a country
that is sometimes dark and terrible .
however , i will use all the magic arts i know
♬ just breathe ♬
to keep you from harm.&apos;
she came close to dorothy
♬ just breathe ♬
and kissed her gently on the forehead .

do not be afraid of him ,
♬ just breathe ♬
but tell your story and ask him to help you .
♬ just breathe ♬
goodbye , my dear . &apos; &quot;
♬ just breathe ♬
