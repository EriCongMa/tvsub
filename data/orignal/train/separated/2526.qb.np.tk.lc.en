飞出个辛普森
联手打造的特别篇
ooh . wiggle in .
get comfortable .
hey , a couch is a couch .
yes , there , you see ?
uh , students , each one of you has been assigned
听着不错 不过就是埋个盒子而已
the mandatory honor of contributing
to the springfield time capsule ,
where your arcana will lie dormant until the 31st century .
and ...
by the time you finish talking ,
we &apos;re gonna be opening this damn capsule .
right . time capsule . nelson , give me something .
i brought a picture of my dad .
he &apos;s still at large ...
in my heart !
i brought my lucky rabbit &apos;s foot .
i can have good luck without it .
wish we could put this moment in the time capsule .
consider it done .
uh , how about you , bart ?
let me guess-- you forgot to bring something .
i &apos;m offended you think i forgot .
let &apos;s see .
listen , boy , this is the only legacy you &apos;ll ever leave .
better make this count .
my sandwich !
and so a thousand years from now this capsule will be opened
by some future mayor quimby .
镇长大人的画像
that @-@ that could be anyone &apos;s ooze .
there .
and now , to help secure the jazz vote ,
lisa simpson will play her saxophone .
even god hates jazz .
a mysterious electrical storm
is currently wreaking havoc with our studio .
but i &apos;m not one of those brainless dolts
who mindlessly reads a teleprompter @-@ er ...
error 401 backslash backslash colon reset c @-@ drive
shutting down .
what the hell was that ?
probably just another piece
of america &apos;s space junk falling out of orbit .
remember when this country didn &apos;t suck ?
&apos;cause i don &apos;t .
homer , i think there &apos;s someone downstairs .
relax , marge .
it &apos;s probably just homer coming home late from moe &apos;s .
ooh , the eyes in that picture are following me !
uh , that &apos;s a mirror .
isn &apos;t all great art kind of a mirror ?
we &apos;d better send the dog down .
come on , here &apos;s your chance to protect us , boy .
come on . c ...
stupid dog .
we &apos;ll have to set a trap , bait--
i mean , bart.
all set .
when he starts gnawing at you , i &apos;ll whack him with this broom .
don &apos;t drink my loved ones !
bite my shiny metal ass !
a robot ! with a catchphrase !
hey , homer , you gonna kiss him or kill him ?
all right ! tether @-@ boy !
okay , so , what are you ?
must be a secret government project .
whoa , what do i look like , a narc ?
my name is bender , and i come from ...
the future !
prove it . what happens to homer simpson in the future ?
i don &apos;t know . you die ?
oh ... my ... god .
he &apos;s telling the truth .
i have to take you to our civic leaders .
hey , hibachi head , how are you gonna pay for that ?
let me just transfer some , uh ,
electronic hyper- credits into your register here .
ding @-@ da @-@ ding- ding @-@ ding @-@ ding- ding @-@ ding !
ooh , and , uh , another round for my friends !
ding @-@ da @-@ ding @-@ ding- da @-@ ding @-@ ding .
hey , this blade rummy is all right .
he &apos;s a big spender , plus he fixed the jukebox .
i think they had a thing going .
* oh , baby , what you done to me ... *
i hate it when they get quiet .
listen , uh , i know you &apos;re a robot
and incapable of emotion ...
it &apos;s true .
i &apos;m empty inside !
look , i just want to ask , can we be friends ?
you &apos;re the only guy i know with less hair than me .
sure . that &apos;s why i came to your time--
for all you know .
for all we know !
d &apos;oh !
a , uh , strike !
a totally legitimate strike !
yeah !
hey , uh , what &apos;s the robot version of bro @-@ mance ?
ro @-@ mance .
you future guys have a word for everything ... pal .
you know , they look a little similar .
yeah . like the guy who designed bender
just took a drawing of dad
and stuck an antenna on it .
a little lazy ,
if you ask me .
regardless , i see no reason to believe
that bender is from the future .
robotic technology today is very advanced .
oh , really ?
can your modern @-@ day robots do this ?
it &apos;s not my birthday--
although maggie &apos;s is pretty soon .
i can &apos;t do &quot; maggie . &quot;
the gs look like sixes .
this is the robot who claims to be from the future .
can your present @-@ day robots do this ?
uh , no , no , they cannot .
not sure why they &apos;d want to-- gorbid .
now , why are you here ?
what is your mission , uh , so to speak ?
i don &apos;t remember .
man , this guy doesn &apos;t ask permission--
he just goes right in you .
ibm的 你们是聪明人么
bender &apos;s mission protocol is definitely intact .
it just requires a delicate procedure
known as &quot; unplug and re @-@ plug . &quot;
because that fixes everything .
i remember why i &apos;m here !
to kill homer simpson !
my ears are burning .
not yet , but they will be .
a boxing glove !
but we bowled together .
aw , i can &apos;t do it .
what stopped you , bender , asimov &apos;s three laws of robotics ?
you think robots care
what some hack science fiction writer thinks ?
i killed isaac asimov on the way over here .
well , isaac somebody .
what the ... ? my ass is about to project something .
you don &apos;t have to announce it .
just do it quietly and blame the dog .
bender ,
we &apos;ve just regained contact .
have you killed homer simpson ?
uh , yep .
killed him good .
if homer &apos;s dead ,
why are the creatures he begat
still here and multiplying out of control ?
what the ... ?
you lied to me , bender !
homer simpson &apos;s still alive !
come on , bender , stabbity @-@ stabbity .
wait ! stop ! why must you kill my dad ?
especially when cheeseburgers are doing the work for you .
homer simpson must be eliminated immediately .
the creatures destroying new new york have his dna .
the monsters are stealing our office supplies !
that &apos;s inexcusable !
hello , robot .
looks like everyone gets a turn to say something .
this concludes my turn .
we sent bender back in time to kill homer
before the monsters could evolve from him .
apparently , this was too heartless a task for a robot .
leela , can you handle it ?
in a new new york minute minute .
right in my language center !
professor , y @-@ you &apos;re a fellow man of science .
maybe if we teamed up ,
we could , uh , figure something out .
okay . eh , but remember , to me you &apos;re incredibly stupid .
oh , and the annoying girl may be helpful .
meanwhile , leela , take homer and explore this time period .
find out why people would ever pay for &quot; freemium games . &quot;
i &apos;ll explain .
okay , it starts free , right ?
then you visit your friend &apos;s game ,
and he &apos;s got this awesome candy mansion ...
get a load of those freaks !
and you &apos;re like , &quot; 99 cents ? !
you bet i &apos;d like one ! &quot;
and that &apos;s why i owe clash of candies $ 20,000 .
here we are .
marge , i &apos;d like you to meet leela and fry .
don &apos;t mention her eye . don &apos;t mention her eye .
don &apos;t mention her hair . don &apos;t mention her hair .
i ... am so pleased to meet you .
nice to be hair .
oh , lord .
professor farnsworth ,
i &apos;m dying to know how you got here .
was it a time machine ?
little girl ,
time machines are physical impossibilities .
we teleported through a singularity
that i quantum entangled to bender
under the guise of fixing his collar .
yes , but how did bender get here ?
with a time machine .
but you just said that ...
sample &apos;s ready !
kill all humans .
kill all humans .
start with flanders .
start with flanders .
good news , everyone !
that means it &apos;s bad .
the human dna in the creatures was only half homer &apos;s .
the other half came from ...
someone else .
oh , so we can kill that person instead .
maybe they &apos;re evil and deserve it .
or have one of those annoying voices
that gets on everybody &apos;s nerves ,
with the adding extra noises for no reason .
myveen .
bloingy .
and the other person is ...
oh , who &apos;s that ?
it &apos;s me .
wait a minute . we don &apos;t have to kill you .
oh , well , that &apos;s better .
we just have to kill all your children .
or just one of them .
if you can figure out which one sired the killer rabbits .
we interrupt this hologram
to bring you an important bulletin .
the horrific creatures destroying new new york
have begun metamorphosing .
eat my shorts !
ay , caramba !
what a surprise . it &apos;s bart.
i &apos;m doing the same jokes a thousand years later .
ay , caramba !
but how did a mere boy destroy the future ?
let this be a lesson .
never throw meaningless crap in a time capsule .
that &apos;s it ! all we have to do is dig up the time capsule .
and bury bart in the hole .
i thought people in the future
would be more full of peace and love .
like in epcot center .
in our time , epcot center is a work farm for the weak .
oh , but it &apos;s not as crowded
as the slave labor camps at universal studios .
we &apos;re here .
my bowling buddy .
you can &apos;t dig that up for a thousand years .
plus , i wrote my name there .
see ?
shmayday !
shmayday ! they got scruffy !
nope . they just got my mustache .
but a life without a mustache ain &apos;t worth livin &apos; .
no !
that generator powers the portal .
if they destroy it , we &apos;ll be ...
sucked back into the future .
okay , head count . one , two , three ...
where &apos;s maggie ?
well , little meatbag ,
it looks like it &apos;s just you and me .
stuck in a terrible past
where i know the result of every horse race ever !
to the track !
i want that .
well , you can &apos;t have it .
why , you little ... why , you little ...
why , you little ...
why , you little ... why , you little ...
dad , it &apos;s me .
prove it . when &apos;s your birthday ?
february 23rd .
february has no 23rd .
you ...
yes , it does .
can you please just get us out of this lousy future ?
actually , of all probable futures ,
this is the worst .
it is , &apos; cause my baby &apos;s not in it .
motherly love .
why did we outlaw that ?
madam , our mechanical friend bender is your portal home .
but we can &apos;t use him until the generator is repaired .
homer works at a nuclear plant .
he can help us get home .
oh , are you good at your job ?
i was voted employee of the month
as an april fools &apos; day joke .
why , you little ... why , you little ...
great .
you and fry can bumble around together
while the rest of us give up
and make peace with our various deities .
as for me , i &apos;m an atheist .
oh , nobody &apos;s father , who art nowhere ,
i know you can &apos;t hear me , completely ignore this prayer .
nothing art thou and nothing will thou ever be .
jesus was just a man .
amen .
well , i shall stay here for the decadence .
there &apos;s no debauchery like end @-@ of @-@ the @-@ world debauchery .
your lips , my lips , apocalypse , ooh !
i can &apos;t believe you &apos;re all giving up without a fight .
lisa , we &apos;re just a package delivery service .
and not a very good one .
the only way to handle the creatures
is to do what we do to each year &apos;s super bowl losers :
shoot them into space .
but we &apos;d have to round them up first .
let me take care of that .
if there &apos;s one thing i know how to do ,
it &apos;s manipulate bart.
you &apos;re nuts . i &apos;ve got a will of iron .
okay , let &apos;s get going .
dad , we have beer in our time .
hey , i haven &apos;t had a drink in a thousand years .
there &apos;s a horse called bender &apos;s bounty .
but my memory says he died during the race .
that can &apos;t be true .
and way , way , way back is bender &apos;s bounty .
damn it !
oh , chief , it looks like a robot
killing horses over there .
oh , a 608 ...
lou , can &apos;t you just let me enjoy my day off ?
w @-@ why are you dressed in your uniform , then ?
&apos;cause they &apos;re the only clothes that fit me .
you happy ? happy ?
attention , goblins .
madison cube garden is filled with butterfinger bars .
and people are laying fingers all over them .
they &apos;re evolving . wow .
that &apos;s a first for you , bart.
will you shut up ?
did i remind you to strap yourselves in ?
输家布法罗比尔队
you realize you &apos;re cheering the death
of millions of my children .
it &apos;s working . i guess the instructions were in english .
what the ...
hey , here &apos;s a souvenir photo of you guys coming out of my chest .
aw , i will treasure this forever .
lie detected .
my sweet baby .
feels like you have a full diaper .
i &apos;ll change her .
here &apos;s your cut .
nice knowing you , meatbags .
have fun turning to dust .
wait , wait , wait . you &apos;re the portal .
how are you gonna get to the future ?
the old @-@ fashioned way .
good night , friend .
you &apos;ll always have a special place here with us .
thanks , pal .
look at this mess .
it would have disintegrated upon entry
if someone hadn &apos;t turned off the atmosphere last night .
i like it cold when i &apos;m sleeping .
besides , these horrible earth creatures are delicious .
the johnsons will be here for dinner any minute .
what happened to the handsome man i married ?
i ate him , remember ?
here they are .
hope we &apos;re not interrupting anything .
i can &apos;t take any more .
i @-@ i can &apos;t take it .
well , perhaps the one of you that is female
should go console her .
* simpsons in the future *
* space jokes flying through sound *
* what are those tubes *
* i wonder what *
* ice cream &apos;s like now *
2006 @-@ 2017
* maybe it &apos;s hot *
* or some new temperature they invented *
that &apos;s it , we &apos;re done .
