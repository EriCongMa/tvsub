i came to pay my respects .
then where is my daughter ?
we found a letter from bethany
explaining the matching clothes , explaining everything
and holbrook is doing whatever he can to get it thrown out .
we should &apos;ve told tanner about him and ali months ago .
once it &apos;s all done , this will all be bookshelves .
oh , looks good .
please don &apos;t go .
i have to .
i applied to six colleges .
you want me to find out why you got rejected .
i need to know if it &apos;s me or if it &apos;s &quot; a. &quot;
ali !
&quot; a &quot; set me up .
alison dilaurentis , you &apos;re under arrest
for the murder of mona vanderwaal .
morning .
i was told--
where you from ?
rosewood p.d. , lieutenant tanner--
yeah , i know her .
you waiting for something ?
we &apos;re done .
thank you .
they need to see me .
they &apos;re not taking my calls .
they can &apos;t keep ignoring me .
why did they move you here ?
i don &apos;t have to explain that to you .
you &apos;ve been in these places .
everything but a bell goes off when they smell fresh meat .
tell spencer to cut this embargo crap
before it &apos;s too late .
have you forgotten what it feels like
to be in a cage for something you didn &apos;t do ?
do you remember how that felt ?
yes , i do .
but i also remember whose words put me in that cage .
do you ?
maybe you &apos;ll finally get it when your girlfriend
and the others are chained to this bench , too ,
because they will be .
they &apos;re next .
unless &quot; a &quot; kills them first .
this is unbelievable .
第五季 第十五集
i mean , ali &apos;s in the penalty box
and she &apos;s still playing offense .
or maybe this is just her being iced out ,
getting desperate .
but if you actually think
there &apos;s somebody on the outside helping her--
yeah , totally . i mean , there was a fireworks display .
maybe she planned that before she got arrested .
no way . someone is helping her .
what do you mean , someone ?
i saw alison and holbrook under the mistletoe ,
and he had his tongue down her throat .
it &apos;s him .
we don &apos;t know that for sure .
didn &apos;t tanner say he was assigned
to a case in pittsburgh ?
he &apos;s off it .
he had to take a personal leave to take care of his sick dad .
that &apos;s convenient .
can you see if holbrook &apos;s visiting ali in prison ?
no , guys , he can &apos;t .
why should he be the one
who &apos;s thrown head @-@ first into the lion &apos;s den ?
all units 10 @-@ 19 .
all units 10 @-@ 19 .
i have to go .
spencer , none of us want to put toby in danger .
well , maybe this weekend , we can come up with a plan .
i &apos;m not even here this weekend .
where are you ?
college visit . ballard .
ballard ? i thought it was skidmore .
how many schools did you get into ?
so what are we gonna do about holbrook ?
this smells like wilden all over again .
holbrook is not wilden .
he may be worse .
holbrook &apos;s not that bad of a cop .
he &apos;s just a really bad kisser .
you kissed him ?
when did you kiss him ?
what ?
hanna ?
look . you guys , it was one kiss . closed mouth .
why did you kiss him ?
he helped my mom with the whole wilden deposit box thing
and he stood up for travis &apos; dad in court .
okay , whatever happened to a thank @-@ you card ?
look , if holbrook &apos;s helping alison ,
then she probably convinced him that she &apos;s the victim .
if he knew who she really was then--
seriously though , how many schools did you get into ?
i &apos;ve got to go .
can i talk to you for a minute ?
sure , just let me finish this .
ezra &apos;s bugging out . the opening went from ten bookworms
and a jug of chablis to an event .
caterer , publicist ,
he &apos;s basically had to hire everything but a belly dancer .
damn .
wow , you into belly dancers ?
i was going to ask him for a raise .
i need the cash . forget it .
wait . cash for what ?
a plane ticket to go and see paige over spring break .
my mom won &apos;t even let me touch my college savings .
meanwhile , every day that goes by , paige and i ,
we &apos;re growing further apart .
last time we spoke , i even mentioned
looking into a liberal arts school in oregon--
em , can we not do this now ?
i can &apos;t talk about this .
paige and me ?
college .
the whole subject is making my hair fall out .
seriously , it &apos;s like coming out in clumps .
what are you talking about ?
em , i &apos;ve been rejected
from every single college i applied to .
yesterday , talmadge wait @-@ listed me .
talmadge .
tell me that &quot; a &quot; isn &apos;t responsible for this .
a wait @-@ list doesn &apos;t mean rejection .
yeah , well , the rest of you
are gonna be waltzing off to sorority rush
and i &apos;m gonna be stuck picking up trash in rosewood .
yeah , that &apos;ll be me , dodging &quot; a &quot; messages
and wearing a big floppy hat to cover my bald spot .
aria , you can turn a wait @-@ list into an acceptance .
my cousin wrote an amazing letter to yale
and totally won them over .
no , this is alison &apos;s revenge , keeping me here .
are you in this class ?
so i opened everything that looks work @-@ related
and i just figured eventually i would forward
your mother &apos;s mail to you .
thanks .
so how &apos;s hanna ?
she &apos;s focusing on the future .
she &apos;s actually leaving later today
for a weekend away at ballard college .
it &apos;s a big decision .
looks like you &apos;ve made one , too .
i &apos;m guessing since you &apos;re faxing out your resume .
yeah .
i saw something that looked potentially interesting
and i thought i should ...
you leave and i &apos;m stuck working with some stranger ,
someone who &apos;ll ask a lot of questions about my family .
i have a few about your sister myself .
honestly , jason , maybe you would be better off
just starting fresh with someone new here .
i don &apos;t agree .
is there anything i can say
to get you to stay for one month ?
just till i feel confident enough to say that i belong here and
really believe it .
hey . can &apos;t talk right now .
why ? what &apos;s going on ?
tanner issued another search behind mona &apos;s house .
tanner still thinks ...
that mona &apos;s body is out there ?
i really got to go .
all clear .
what do you mean it &apos;s your knife ?
i recognized it as soon as i saw it . it &apos;s my family &apos;s .
my dad popped the top off a jar with it
when i was eight and broke the handle .
there &apos;s a chunk missing right in the center .
yeah .
how do you know what this knife looks like ?
because i &apos;ve used it . many times .
it &apos;s from my family &apos;s cabin .
when i saw it , i froze .
a million things went through my head .
and for a moment i forgot i was a cop ,
so i didn &apos;t know what to do .
i just left it there .
oh , my god .
but i know i have to go back .
of course , you do . you have to go back and get it .
we have to get rid of it before anybody else finds it .
wait , wait , wait . slow down .
that knife could be the murder weapon .
it &apos;s what we &apos;ve been looking for .
it &apos;s what we need .
we ?
the police .
toby , alison said it herself ,
she wants us with her , behind bars .
she &apos;s already framed me once . the knife is a plant .
you don &apos;t know that .
i want to turn it in .
if alison stole that knife and used it ,
that could lock her away for good .
all we need is just one of her prints .
right , but what if it has mine on it ?
or hanna &apos;s ?
or yours ?
yeah , that &apos;s a gamble , but ...
but what ?
i &apos;m not risking my neck so you can get a medal for this .
this is about doing the right thing .
there is no right thing .
there &apos;s only by @-@ the @-@ book or save @-@ our @-@ ass .
and i know which one i &apos;m doing .
don &apos;t , man .
spencer ?
this is crazy .
i know you feel the same way i do .
i think that we shouldn &apos;t do anything .
we will promise not to touch it ,
if you promise to keep quiet .
you just want to leave it there ?
fine .
then that &apos;s what we &apos;ll do .
but no one can know that we had this conversation .
of course .
caleb , please .
can i borrow your eye ?
sure .
tell me if this is slanted .
and don &apos;t lie to me .
i &apos;ll think i aced it and i &apos;ll live to regret it .
i regret a lot .
i spend my days paddling through a stew of regrets .
it &apos;s perfect .
wow . you &apos;re a really good liar .
i understand that , andre ,
but scallops are not part of the budget .
what ?
he keeps putting me on hold .
well , tell him to stick to the original plan .
and that was , like , three plans ago .
oh , he &apos;s coming tomorrow night .
you should really talk to him .
he teaches at vassar .
have you heard from them yet ?
um , no , no . not yet .
andre , still here .
so listen , we need to go back to the original plan .
because it &apos;s a bookstore .
nobody is coming here for the tamarind dipping sauce .
what ?
he just quit on me .
i can do it .
do what ?
cater your party .
pays more than a barista , right ?
did i miss something ?
when did you become a professional chef ?
i &apos;ve been helping my mom in the kitchen
since i could walk .
let me do it .
yeah , i &apos;m sure it &apos;ll be amazing .
it &apos;s not like emily &apos;s a stranger in that kitchen .
and your guests are gonna be here in less than 27 hours ,
so we could either debate this or i could get started ,
stick to your budget and blow you away . your choice .
did you even take home ec ?
sorry . go for it , emily .
hello ?
this call is from the chester women &apos;s correctional facility .
you have a call from inmate--
alison dilaurentis .
if you like to accept this call , press one .
jason ?
uh , no , alison . it &apos;s hanna &apos;s mom .
mrs. marin , is my brother there ?
your brother ?
can i speak with him , please ?
he &apos;s ...
not able to do this right now .
can you call back tomorrow ?
i need to talk to him .
i &apos;m sorry , alison . you &apos;ll have to call back another time .
please don &apos;t make me do that again .
saying no is not as hard as taking the call .
have you seen her since--
once . i can &apos;t go back .
i can &apos;t even look at her now without thinking
she might &apos;ve had something to do
with what happened to my mom .
that building , where the student union is ,
that &apos;s the original college .
founding father eustace ballard
laid the first brick of foundation himself .
i can show you a plaque carved in wood
from mr. ballard &apos;s outhouse .
okay .
did i mention ballard was also a minister ?
yeah , you did .
remember , and then i told you that
my mom was dating one ?
oh , right . cool beans .
let me grab us a weekend calendar .
save me .
what &apos;s wrong ?
my buddy has verbal diarrhea .
the back of a cereal box is more interesting than this girl .
sorry .
that was supposed to make you laugh . are you okay ?
toby was on a search at mona &apos;s property
and found a bloody knife .
what ?
it &apos;s from the cavanaugh &apos;s cabin .
who put it there ? holbrook ?
caleb , i &apos;m coming home .
no . you &apos;re not , okay ?
that is exactly what &quot; a &quot; wants , for you to drop everything .
don &apos;t .
hanna ? hanna ?
hey . can i show you something before ezra gets back ?
here .
so i spent all of last period in the library
writing my letter to talmadge .
and i don &apos;t want to sound desperate ,
but i just figured , you know , if they see , like ,
a hundred of these every day--
no , it &apos;s good , but--
what ?
you need to make it more personal .
personal ?
what-- what do you want me to tell them ?
that i spent all of junior year
being hunted down by &quot; a &quot; ?
aria , that &apos;s--
yeah , and i wanted to write this , like , 2 weeks earlier ,
but i was too busy being suffocated by a plastic sheet ?
you &apos;re spiraling again .
no , you can &apos;t spiral , emily ,
if you &apos;ve already crashed .
talmadge was supposed to be my slam @-@ dunk .
then yesterday i got a letter that was all slam and no dunk
and i &apos;ve already missed every other deadline .
so if i don &apos;t get bumped up from this wait @-@ list ,
i don &apos;t get to go to college next fall .
i &apos;m going to call my mom .
i didn &apos;t know how to tell you this , but nobody wants me .
aria , that &apos;s not true .
there are many , many , many great colleges
that you can apply to in the future .
no , i mean , i can write a better letter .
you could write the grapes of wrath ,
and it still wouldn &apos;t matter .
talmadge recently hired jackie molina
as an admissions officer .
jackie ?
as in your ex jackie , who hates my guts ?
you forgot to mention that she hates my guts even more .
look , i know it hurts , but it &apos;s a temporary setback .
that &apos;s all . promise .
seriously ?
i mean , the shelf life on secrets around here
has reached an all @-@ time low .
i know . i shouldn &apos;t have told her .
you could &apos;ve at least warned me
before i was carpet @-@ bombed with angry texts .
why was she angry ?
because i didn &apos;t tell her .
and i had to beg her not to tell aria and emily .
what is that ?
you &apos;re going back for it , aren &apos;t you ?
spencer , if my prints are on that ...
i can &apos;t get hauled away on suspicion of murder .
again .
&quot; again &quot; ?
look , i &apos;m sure that hanna has told you some stuff about my past .
but there are things i haven &apos;t even told her .
what did you do ?
i hacked for some dudes in allentown ,
some credit card number scam .
when one of them turned up dead ,
the other one pointed the finger at me .
i mean , i was easy to railroad .
i &apos;d bailed from my foster home .
i was living on the streets .
what happened ?
one of the detectives saw that i was just some stupid kid
who &apos;d made some stupid decisions .
he got me released .
but if i get taken in on a charge like that ,
i &apos;m not gonna have somebody there to look after me .
i &apos;m not a stupid kid anymore .
you &apos;re gonna go tell toby now ?
no .
i &apos;m coming with you .
what about the fillings ?
i mean , do i start with that first ,
or should i maybe be doing--
oh , mom , let me call you right back .
okay , thanks .
i thought you went home to crash .
i did . but i couldn &apos;t sleep .
nervous about tomorrow ?
no , i swerved right past nervous
and went into a full @-@ blown panic attack .
emily , should we be calling in some ... help ?
what do you mean ?
like a professional chef .
why ?
no , everything is totally under control .
food is gonna be awesome .
okay .
we &apos;re gonna be eating dinner off the walls ?
that was an experiment .
but i just spoke to my mom
and she gave me her famous empanada recipe .
great . because i can always
call a restaurant or i can ask--
no . don &apos;t .
there is no need to panic .
everything is gonna be great .
hey , sweetie , how &apos;s it going ?
it &apos;s going great .
i can &apos;t hear you . where are you ?
i &apos;m at the library .
nice . is it impressive ?
oh , yeah .
mom , i really have to get off the phone soon though .
of course .
i just wanted to make sure you &apos;re on the alert ,
if you &apos;re taken to any parties . i just--
mom , i have to-- i have to go .
where is 2 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 ?
thank you .
oh . hello .
i &apos;m looking for a mr. holbrook .
poppa !
this is crazy , this would be hard enough in the day .
we have to find it .
we can &apos;t see anything .
spencer , we have to find it .
what can i do for you ?
i &apos;m looking for a detective holbrook .
i &apos;m his father . who are you ?
a friend of his .
is he around ?
haven &apos;t seen him in weeks .
i thought he was taking care of you .
do you know where i could find him ?
i figured if anyone knew where he was , it &apos;d be you .
you out on bail ?
uh , no .
college weekend .
i &apos;d better get going .
caleb .
so what time did you get home ?
about 3 hours ago .
sorry you didn &apos;t tell me . i woke you up .
who says i went to sleep ?
she still hasn &apos;t written me back .
who ?
paige .
when &apos;s the last time you two ...
forget it .
let me read it .
what ?
this is your way of getting personal ?
yeah . if i &apos;m pitching myself to jackie ,
why not lob it over the plate ?
tell me you didn &apos;t send this .
why ? it &apos;s right in her sweet spot .
&quot; i regret that i squandered my high school career ,
getting involved with an older guy .
i was robbed of all the rituals that my classmates enjoyed .
this secret relationship kept me in a fishbowl ,
separating me from my family , my friends , even myself . &quot;
okay , i don &apos;t need a dramatic reading ,
emily , i wrote it .
if ezra saw this , he &apos;d be so hurt .
no , he wouldn &apos;t .
no he would know exactly what i &apos;m doing .
and once i get accepted , i can just take back every word .
please tell me you didn &apos;t send this .
why do you keep saying that ?
yes , i sent it , i emailed it last night .
it &apos;s done .
oh , shoot . i got to go .
why ?
because i have 200 empanadas to fill .
that is so amazing .
oh , my gosh . what is that spice ?
i &apos;m so glad you like this .
hmm , emily , i want you to meet somebody .
talia sandoval , emily fields .
hi , it &apos;s nice to meet you .
what &apos;s going on ?
oh , i asked talia to help out tonight in the kitchen .
i don &apos;t understand .
um , well , i would just prefer that you come tonight as a guest .
i don &apos;t want to be a guest .
you hired me to--
i know , i know .
but i think that we can both relax knowing that
there &apos;s a professional back there in the kitchen .
let &apos;s just think of talia like a savior .
you know that i &apos;m gonna pay you for the work you did last night .
yeah , it &apos;s not just about last night .
i was hoping i could maybe become more than a barista .
okay , i didn &apos;t realize .
well , we can revisit that at a later day .
right . i &apos;ve work to do .
what is this ?
it &apos;s filling for empanadas .
excuse me .
you know , if the dough &apos;s been in the fridge all night ,
you may want to--
if i wanted advice , i &apos;d ask my mother .
we go way back .
caleb , what are you doing here ?
what happened ?
i couldn &apos;t do it .
what do you mean you couldn &apos;t do it ?
i felt like i was being followed .
i drove to the lake and when i got there , i ...
i just couldn &apos;t do it .
okay , fine , i &apos;ll do it then .
wait . don &apos;t you get it ?
as long as that knife exists ,
&quot; a &quot; is gonna find a way to get it back .
then we make it not exist .
do we even know how to turn this kiln on ?
hang on , i &apos;m looking it up .
it &apos;s got to be one of these switches , right ?
yeah , maybe this one ?
i don &apos;t know if i got it working .
i don &apos;t know . let &apos;s just try it .
spencer !
i think there are still a lot of changes i &apos;d like to make
so we &apos;re sure we &apos;re getting the most--
hi , jackie ?
um , it &apos;s aria montgomery .
do you remember me ?
i &apos;ll see you later , jeff .
sorry , i didn &apos;t mean to interrupt your--
what are you doing here ? don &apos;t you live in pennsylvania ?
yeah . it &apos;s a long story .
i applied here , and then i was wait @-@ listed ,
and then last night i emailed a letter to the admissions board
that i would really like to delete ...
if possible .
why do you want to delete it ?
jackie , it &apos;s-- it &apos;s complicated .
i don &apos;t want to have to get into the details .
oh , you sure did in your letter .
is that why you rushed up here ?
you &apos;re worried i &apos;m gonna share the contents with ezra ?
don &apos;t .
your secret &apos;s safe with me .
if i never spoke to him again , it would be way too soon .
thank you .
after i read your letter ,
i thought about all the time i wasted
believing he was somebody he wasn &apos;t .
i wish they &apos;d invent a pacemaker
that zapped your heart every moment
you started falling for mr. wrong .
would save a lot of girls from making a huge mistake .
not just us .
caleb .
caleb , oh , my god .
hang on , hang on , hang on .
caleb !
oh , my god .
oh , my god , what happened ?
caleb ! oh , my god .
are you okay ? are you okay ?
did the door shut by accident ?
i don &apos;t know .
where &apos;s the knife ? is it in there ?
surprise , surprise .
who did you think it was ?
holbrook ?
look , alison , this isn &apos;t a visit .
i came here to tell you one thing .
give up .
i still know you , at least some of you .
and i know that at every turn you &apos;ve chosen to fight .
but just this once , don &apos;t .
i already have given up .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m here .
i could have thrown you all under the bus , but i didn &apos;t .
i kept my mouth shut .
but do i get a thanks for it ?
what are we supposed to thank you for ?
framing spencer ?
putting a knife in mona &apos;s--
what knife ?
look , if i was clever as everyone thinks that i am ,
wouldn &apos;t i have given myself a better alibi than my brother ?
you want to know where i was
for those missing hours on thanksgiving ?
i was waiting for cyrus .
i got a message from him asking to meet .
he sounded freaked out and i was worried
that he was gonna expose our deal , so i went .
i waited for hours for him and he never showed .
it was only when i heard that mona was missing
that i realized that this was just a trap set by &quot; a. &quot;
i would &apos;ve never been able to explain that to the police .
i couldn &apos;t even tell my own father .
but he lied for me anyway .
hanna , if i was &quot; a , &quot;
why would i let this happen to me ?
i don &apos;t know .
but i do know that if you are &quot; a , &quot;
you &apos;re counting on that last little shred of me
that gives a damn about what happens to you .
and you shouldn &apos;t .
em , hey . hi , have you seen toby ?
no . take an empanada .
no , thanks .
what do you mean , &quot; no , thanks &quot; ?
i made these . eat one .
uh , i just walked in .
and you &apos;re starving . eat it .
wasn &apos;t caleb coming with you ?
he bailed .
he just wasn &apos;t up to it .
em , there &apos;s a hair in this .
just eat around it , okay ?
there you go . i &apos;m so sorry .
who is that ?
i don &apos;t want to talk about it .
melissa ?
are you melissa hastings ?
uh , no , that &apos;s my sister .
oh , that &apos;s a relief .
why is that a relief ?
because i &apos;m not looking for a roommate .
your mom told my mom that i could rent your guesthouse .
wait . when did this happen ?
our moms are friends ?
kind of .
your mom sued my granny &apos;s nursing home for my mom .
have you tried these crab cakes yet ?
they &apos;re awesome , they &apos;re like the new party drug .
thank you for the tip .
i &apos;m jonny raymond . you &apos;re ...
spencer hastings .
the sister who hasn &apos;t checked out yet .
i &apos;m psyched about the space .
i don &apos;t think that you really should be .
you don &apos;t want to live in our backyard .
why ?
because somebody was buried in it .
will you excuse me ?
oh , don &apos;t do that .
hey , they can be saved .
okay , you know what , i &apos;m not looking for a savior .
emily , if i told you how may times i bombed
before i perfected even one signature dish--
i didn &apos;t take this on to flaunt my brand , okay ?
i needed the cash to save a relationship ,
which actually doesn &apos;t make sense
because that relationship doesn &apos;t exist anymore .
and now i &apos;m stuck here , making plans to go and see someone
who &apos;s moved across the country , started a new life ,
and can &apos;t even find a second to return any of my stupid emails .
okay ?
emily , emily . okay , okay .
may i ?
so the first kitchen that i ever worked in
had a hard and fast rule .
just about any tapas can be rescued
with either some slivered almonds or the right sauce .
oh , come on , just try it .
look , if you hate it , you can spit it in my face .
i didn &apos;t expect you to be home .
i was just gonna leave these .
were you at the office today ?
yeah , i figured i could use a saturday to catch up .
but some of the paperwork didn &apos;t make sense .
we have a tenant whose lease expired 3 years ago .
i &apos;m happy to take a look at it and see if i can sort it out .
great .
do you want me to drop it off to your house tomorrow or ...
i &apos;m staying at the edgewood .
my father made it very clear
i &apos;m not welcome since my sister ... left .
why ?
probably because i &apos;m the one who got her arrested .
have you eaten ?
there &apos;s somebody that i really want you to meet .
bob .
so sorry .
bob , this is the young lady i was telling you about .
aria , this is bob milsom ,
who teaches at vassar .
i thought that one gifted writer would appreciate another .
toby , wait .
toby !
you looked me in the eye and
then you deliberately went behind my back--
so did you !
how else would you &apos;ve known
that the knife was gone ? you went back , too .
because i wanted to do the right thing .
yeah , if you thought that ,
then you would &apos;ve picked it up the first time .
you know , you keep on talking about the right thing
as if we &apos;ve no idea what it is .
but in this case , we needed to protect ourselves
and that meant getting rid of it , okay ?
spencer--
so it &apos;s done .
i can &apos;t--
it &apos;s destroyed .
spencer--
caleb and i , we got it--
i can &apos;t . listen to this !
don &apos;t you understand you &apos;re making it worse ?
there are things that i can &apos;t know about ,
things that you can &apos;t say out loud .
you told me once that i could tell you anything .
i &apos;ve got to go .
maybe jessica had a verbal agreement with these tenants .
