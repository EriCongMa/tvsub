For over a century, I have lived in secret.
Until now.
I know the risk, but I have to know her.
Elena. She's a dead ringer for katherine.
What happened to your face?
It's nothing.
It didn't look like nothing.
Matty tells me you broke his heart.
Mom.
He found his rebound girl.
There's a tomb underneath the church.
You saved everyone in the church?
27 vampires, damon.
You can't just bring them back.
It's Harper.
I'm glad you found us.
Annabella. Close the door, please.
That T-shirt...
Hey. Bethanne.
It's bargain.
You guys have been watching the same thing the whole time?
There are over one hundred channels. It's called a remote control.
This button changes the channel.
Hold it like this.
Did you get enough, sweetheart?
For now.
Anna, are you hungry?
Do you want a little?
No. Thank you, miss Givens.
Why don't you lay down for a while and get some rest?
She's fine.
Aren't you, Miss. Givens?
Of course, I am.
I'm fine.
Hey, mom.
Mom.
Hey, mom.
What? I'm trying to sleep.
Uh, I was just making sure you were alive.
I'm sorry, sweetie.
It was a late night.
My head is throbbing.
Yeah, um,
I'd appreciate it
if you wouldn't bring the party home.
And I'm pretty sure the neighbors would appreciate it, too.
It wasn't a party. It was one guy.
Don't be so judgy.
Yeah, well,
I talked Tooberta at the grill
and there's still a bartending position open.
If you, uh, wanted to get a job.
Well, I figured she'd still be pissed
about the last time I worked there.
I think she's desperate.
I'll check it out.
Yeah?
Don't act so surprised.
Well, I mean, I just...
I didn't know how long you planned on sticking around here.
Well, there's background due.
It's back in everything, mom.
Like i said, I'll check it out.
Who's that?
That's Caroline.
Easy.
Yeah, come in.
Hi, Mrs. Donovan.
Ok, well, we're gonna be late,
So, let's just get going.
Yeah.
How are you?
Good.
Damon hasn't said a word to me.
Every time I try to talk to him, he shuts me down.
Do you think he's still trying to find katherine?
I don't know.
He waited 145 years,
Only to find out that katherine could not care less.
I mean, that's gotta hurt, right?
And it couldn't have happened to a nicer guy.
You have every reason to be upset with him.
Have you thought any more about what you're going to do?
About what?
Isobel, my vampire birth mother,
who's related to my vampire ancestor Katherine,
who screwed over your vampire brother.
Nah. Haven't thought about it at all.
I'm sorry I brought it up.
It'd just be nice if we could get through one day
without having to deal with any of it.
No vampire mother or brother.
No vampires at all?
No vampires but you.
I just want to get us back to normal stuff.
like school.
And homework.
And here's a thought.
Fun.
Ooh, that sounds good to me.
When do we start?
We can watch a movie at my place.
Uh, with your mom?
And a 6-pack?
You know, you don't really help the situation.
You could at least try to be nice.
Oh, I'm sorry.
It's hard for me to show kindness
to people that hate me.
I'm not that evolved.
So, what movie tonight?
Whatever you want to do is fine by me.
But I'm late and I gotta go, ok?
Bye.
And the keypad is for texting,
Which is what you do
When you want to avoid talking to someone.
Hey, Anna, It's Jeremy.
I haven't heard from you for a while.
I am... I didn't break it, I sware
I was just showing Harper what you taught me.
What a marvelous device.
Who was that?
Jeremy Gilbert.
Is that your boyfriend?
Of course not.
Uh, what do you think?
You're very respectable.
That's the goal.
I can't say that I miss corsets.
Susie Sunshine gave me her car keys
And her ATM card.
What's that?
I'll explain later.
Where are you going?
We have some business in town.
We'll be back as soon as we can.
I trust that you'll keep an eye on things.
So, I'm the babysitter now.
Frederick.
If this is going to work,
We have to cooperate with one another.
So you say.
I'll watch things, Miss Pearl.
Thank you, Harper.
I'm thinking nothing huge,
Just dinner at the grill,
Maybe late movie.
You mean like a double date?
2 pair out on a friday night,
Coupled.
Yeah, a double date.
Do you think that's a good idea?
Why not?
You know, we all haven't gone out together before
And I don't want it to be uncomfortable for us.
Like, the couple dynamics have changed,
And there's been a little awkwardness
Between you, Matt and me,
And I just think it's important
That we get over it.
I don't know.
You know what?
I... I think that sounds like a great idea.
You do?
Yeah.
Yeah, a nice evening
out with friends.
Sounds fun.
As in fun.
A double date it is.
Ok.
So, we will see you tonight.
Ok.
Ok.
Hello, Damon.
Ever hear of knocking?
An invitation wasn't necessary.
I'm surprised that no living person resides here.
Is it just you and your brother?
Yeah.
How do you keep off all the vampires?
Killed 'em.
Damn!
Have a seat, Damon.
I was hoping we could have a word.
Sure.
Freak.
We've taken up residence
At a farm house just outside of town.
It'll suffice for now.
All 25 vampires?
Not all. Some.
I imagine that a few have already left town.
Others are probably still in the woods
Or, like us, acclimating.
How'd they get out of the tomb?
I think that we screwed up
That part of our hocus-pocus.
I understand from Anna
That the founding families still have a secretcouncil?
And you're a part of it.
Pfft. That's ridiculous.
I've been in Mystic Falls since the comet, Damon.
I'm up to speed.
So am I.
And now that you've infiltrated the council,
I'll need to know everything they know.
Starting with a list of names
Of all the council members and their families.
And everyone you've supplied with vervain.
Yes, that will have to stop immediately.
What exactly are you trying to achieve?
Mystic falls is our home, Damon.
They took that from us.
Our land, our home.
It's time we rebuild.
What, are you crazy?
That was 1864.
Wake up, woman.
The world has moved on.
As a reward for your help,
I'm willing to give you what you want most.
I want nothing.
Katherine.
You wouldn't even know where she was.
You've been under the ground
for the last 1.1/2 centuries.
Katherine and I were best friends
long before we came to Mystic Falls, Damon.
I know how she thinks.
I know her patterns.
I know where to find her.
I no longer have any desire to see Katherine
ever again.
And there's no way in hell i'm gonna play the role of your little minion.
I'm not asking for your help, Damon.
Finding Katherine
Was just a mere gesture of kindness.
The rest is non-negotiable.
I have 400 years on you, little boy.
I'll rip you from limb to limb without even blinking and you know it.
I'll be in touch.
You got me flowers.
Well, I figured it's a date,
why not do it right?
I would have driven, too,
But you're the one with the car.
You know, you'd think that for someone who was around
when the car was invented, that you'd have one.
Oh, I have one.
I just never drive it.
You know, it's not too late to cancel.
Why would we do that?
I don't know.
It just seems surreal.
Like maybe we weren't meant
To get to the normal part.
That's exactly why we're going to do it.
We're going to go out,
have some fun,
And try to remember that we don't have to be so serious.
Listen, when I decided to stay here and to get to know you,
It was so that I could do things like this.
I could bring my girlfriend flowers,
take her out on a date,
try to be normal.
Have you ever even been on a double date before?
Oh, absolutely.
Um, 1972. Hef and the twins.
What?
Yeah. Playmates. I got Miss. June.
Are you serious?
Miss Sommers?
Yes? Hi, Pearl.
Hi. This is my daughter Annabelle.
Of course. Jeremy's friend.
Nice to see you, Miss Sommers.
Oh, Jenna, please.
This property was in
My brother-in-law's family for generations.
It's one of the original structures in Mystic Falls,
used to be one of those old-fashioned drug store thingies.
You mean an apothecary?
You don't say.
Sorry, if it's musty.
No one's been in here for months.
I'll use my imagination.
Annabelle.
Coming, mother.
What's with the glasses inside?
Ahem, my eyes are a little sensitive today.
You're new around here.
Oh, on the contrary.
I'm very old.
Bourbon neat
I haven't been gone that long.
I would remember someone who looked like you.
Yeah? Where'd you go?
Around, about.
Been there.
I love to see a man drown his sorrows.
It'so sxy.
It's more like nursing my wounds.
And you?
I was supposed to be interviewing for the bartender job,
But, um, I think the manager blew me off.
Well, that's not very nice.
Yeah. Last time I was in town,
I slept with her boyfriend.
Well, that's not very nice, either.
It happens.
Yes, it does.
Kelly?
Kelly Donovan.
Jen!
I heard you were back in town.
You used to baby-sit me
And then, I used to party with her.
This woman was crazy.
Not as crazy as you.
Ha, not anymore.
Well, sit, drink.
Uh, I shouldn't.
I'm responsible now, haven't you heard?
Then take a night off. It's good for the soul.
Great for the soul.
This is not gonna end well.
Can't wait.
I hate this house.
It's better than the tomb.
I didn't stay locked up for 145 years
to end up locked up here.
Maybe you should quit complaining.
You gonna stop me?
Let it be, Frederick.
You heard what Pearl said.
I don't care what Pearl said.
What you got, boy?
Try that again.
Back off.
Back off.
We don't fight each other.
Those are the rules.
And I'm tired of your rules. I want out of this house.
Why can't we go into town?
Eventually.
But for now, we have to keep a low profile.
No one knows who I am.
The salvatore brothers do.
And I wish to hell I could run into them.
They're the reason we were caught in the first place.
So, uh, Matt, how do you like working here?
Uh, it's not that bad.
Wait staff comes out pretty good.
You know, they can't keep a bartender to save their lives.
I actually put my mom up for the job.
How's that been
having Kelly back?
You know, the same old Kelly.
She's, uh, she's trying, sort of.
Kelly and my mom were best friends growing up.
That's how Matt and I first met.
We shared a crib together.
You're kidding.
No, we've, uh, known each other our whole lives.
You gotta be kidding me.
Where are you going?
Bethanne and I are going out for a bit.
Hit the town. Kick up our heels.
But we're not supposed to leave.
Miss Pearl made that very clear.
You gonna stop me?
I didn't think so.
Anna.
Surprised?
I, uh, I thought you and your mom were leaving town.
Oh, change of plans.
I'm sorry. I thought you'd be psyched.
No! No, no, I mean, I am.
Of course I am.
All right, then.
Step aside.
Don't be grumpy.
It can't be that bad.
You'd be surprised.
My primary reason for existence has abandoned me.
And, after today's events,
the remains of the shaky ground that I walk on
are about to go kaboom.
Let's get hammered.
Let's.
At least they're having fun.
They're drunk.
Remember when Elena's parents busted us here
after homecoming?
Oh, my God, yes!
We were wasted.
It was the first time I ever got drunk.
I blame Matt.
Her parents got seated at the next booth.
Oh, and Matt had me pretend that I was choking
so we could get away.
Except her dad was a doctor,
so, he jumped up to save her.
And I ran and slipped on the wet floor
and bit it.
In front of everyone.
Do you remember that?
3 stitches, a hangover for days,
and I was grounded from seeing this one for a week.
Well, I'm gonna go to the restroom.
Elena?
Quick, hide.
We're not here.
Why? Where'd we go?
Children under our care at 5:00 o'clock.
This is not role modelish.
Damn.
Ok, so, uh, what made you and your mom
decide to stay in town?
Oh, she got this business opportunity.
She's gonna open up a little store.
It's always be her dream.
So, yeah, we're staying.
And I'm thinking about going back to high school.
So, you'll be seeing a lot more of me.
Oh, yeah?
Enough of home schooling.
You know? I'd like to be a normal teen for once.
But I have to ask my mom first.
She'll have an opinion.
Yeah, well, I wish you were there now.
I actually have to write another paper.
I was thinking about squeezing one more out
on the vampires of mystic falls.
Really?
Haven't you exhausted the subject?
No. No, I want to go deeper, you know?
I want to understand why people were labeled as vampires
back in the day.
I mean, maybe there is such a thing as vampires.
They're just different from the way we always thought they were.
What do you mean?
Maybe they're normal and good,
just outsiders, you know?
Um, misunderstood.
You're kidding, right?
Don't you think it could be possible?
You did give me all that info.
Jeremy, I made it up, ok?
I mean, you were all cute and fluffy
and I wanted to make a good impression.
Is there anything you're not good at?
Double dating.
This is all kinda new to me.
I usually keep to myself.
I don't always fit in.
That's because you're that guy.
What guy?
The guy who seems like he has everything
So, people don't kinda run the other way.
Is that what I seem like?
Pretty much.
What a dick.
What are you doing?
What?
Well, the point of this
was to show him how much you care about Stefan.
You're not to hopscotch down memory lane.
I was just trying to make conversation.
Well, try less.
Caroline.
Katherine.
I'm sorry. You have the wrong person.
Elena, come on.
My mistake.
How's everything going?
Matt's cheating.
No need. I'm awesome.
Stefan Salvatore.
Is everything OK?
Everything's great.
So, you didn't recognize him?
You haven't seen him before?
No, there was nothing familiar about him at all.
All right. Let's call it a night.
You know? Send Matt and Caroline home?
You know, the whole point of tonight was to not have to deal with this stuff.
We need to get through one night,
one normal night.
You sure?
No, I'm not sure.
But I don't know what else to do.
Look, if there's another vampire in town,
He'll still be here tomorrow.
We'll deal with it tomorrow.
Ok.
Oh, it's them.
Come here.
Uh, yeah, this is much better than watching "Damon visit cougar town."
No offense.
Don't remind me.
Man, I've always wanted to see
what it looks like in this place.
Yeah, I guess it's, uh, a bit watch.
Ha! Yeah, my entire house could fit in here, like, twice.
I feel like I've been here before.
It's weird.
Do you guys wanna watch a movie or something?
Whoa, these are great.
That's, uh,
Just a little hobby of mine.
I did the entire Mustang series
when I was 9.
You like cars?
That's an understatement.
Come with me.
So, the thing about cherries,
You have to...
Oh, my goddness.
That's amazing. You were quick.
And that would be my cue.
You giving up already?
Oh, yeah.
See you guys.
Prepare yourself, my friend.
Whoa, wait.
How do you have this?
Got passed down through the family.
Why don't...
Why don't you drive it?
Well, it, uh, doesn't run.
I mean, it's not that I could figure out.
Why would you keep a car that doesn't run?
Be more of a girl right now.
Hey, why don't you come take a look at this for me?
Elena,
remember the old Camaro your dad used to have?
Of course.
Hey, I built and rebuilt that engine 20 times.
Well, I don't like sports cars.
They're too hard to make out in
Nah, it wasn't that bad.
I'm sorry, man.
No, no.
Don't worry about it.
You and Elena, you guys have a history
And ignoring it doesn't do anybody any good.
She's good with you.
You know, I wasn't sure, but she's happy
And I'm glad.
All right. Let's take a look at this.
Damn it!
Need some help?
Damn it!
Stupid shoe.
Gotta pick up your other foot.
Thanks.
There you go.
Thanks.
I think.
Was that Damon Salvatore you were with?
The one and only.
You know him?
We go way back.
He still live out by Miller Lane?
Uh, he lives in the old boarding house.
by Wickery Bridge.
He's still in there
If you wanna say "Hi."
I'd rather stay here and talk to you.
Nice.
Very smooth with the shoe and the flirt.
But I'm a little drunk.
And hot guy plus drunk me equals very bad things.
No.
I'm pretty sure you'd like it.
Sorry.
That was a seriously lame pick-up.
I'm sorry.
That is a nice scent you're wearing.
What is it?
I don't know.
It was a gift.
And that is a cab, so.
Vervain.
Making it hard to find something to eat in this town.
Caroline
I don't want to talk about it.
You are being ridiculous.
And insecure and stupid.
But that doesn't change the fact
That Matt's always gonna be in love with you
And I'm always gonna be the backup.
You're not the backup.
Yes, I am.
I'm Matt's Elena backup.
I'm your Bonnie backup.
Now it's about me and Bonnie?
You don't get it.
Why would you?
You're everyone's first choice.
Piece of cake.
You know what?
Why don't you guys go ahead
And take it for a spin?
Really?
Yeah.
Caroline.
You all right?
If it's not vampire's, it's girlfriend's.
All right. Roast beef, turkey.
What do you want?
Oh, let's do the works.
Pile it high.
All right. I like your style.
Will you grab the bread for me?
Ok.
What are you doing?
It's just a cut.
Will you hand me that towel?
I... I... I can't.
You got a problem with blood, Anna?
What's the matter?
It's just blood, Anna.
What are you doing?
I knew it.
Go for it.
Jeremy.
Jenna. Hey, what's, uh...
What's up?
Regret.
Make sure you lock that up.
Did I just pass their driveway?
Uh, I think it's up there.
This is an amazing car.
Did I pass?
The whole double date thing
Was obviously a test
To see how I would do around Elena.
I don't know.
You were reminiscing
About the Elena years all night.
Caroline,
That stuff came before, ok?
It's not just gonna go away.
I know that, ok?
No. No, you don't.
Because you're letting it turn you into a crazy person.
Look, it's my fault.
I, you know, I made it pretty clear early on
That Elena still means something to me.
But all that talk,
That was just
2 old friends and some memories.
Tonight wasn't about me and Elena.
I was there
Because I wanted to be with you.
And I don't know what this means
Or what we are,
But I do know that you're the only person
I want to be in this car with right now.
I don't even know if this makes sense,
Because I'm not really that good at expressing myself.
No, no.
I think you're doing just fine.
Sports cars.
Yeah.
Now that you've got me here.
What are you gonna do with me?
I'm going to...
Going to do this.
Mom?
Damon?
Oh, my god. Matt.
Oh, my god.
I gotta...
it's fine. Just go.
I...I'll take her home.
Thanks, man.
Where have you been?
Um, I needed some air.
For 3 hours?
Tell me. Where have you been?
Out.
I was out.
Annabelle, don't do this.
I can't fight you, too.
What?
I'm sorry.
Sorry I'm bailing.
Just wish you'd let me drive you home.
Normal people don't have chaperones
or bodyguards or babysitters.
We're normal tonight, remember?
I know, I just get so worried about you.
Stefan, I can't live every minute
afraid that someone's gonna come after me.
I won't.
That's not living.
Ok.
Call me when you get home safe?
Mm-hmm.
Ok.
Bye,Stefan.
Bye.
Don't look at me like that.
Are you crazy?
Save the lecture. Look...
Damn it.
I remember them.
From 1864.
They were in the tomb.
Yeah.
About that.
Matt.
Matt.
I don't wanna hear it, mom.
Look.
Matty, please.
Do you know what I was doing tonight, mom?
I was having fun.
You know, trying to forget about
all the crap that I have to deal with every day?
Just enjoy a night with my friends.
And then, there you are.
Wasted at the bar,
Where I work, by the way.
to pay the bills that you don't pay.
And then you're off acting like a freaking kid?
Hookin' up with some guy half your age.
I'm the kid, mom.
You're supposed to be responsible for me.
I know, Matt.
How was your night?
Oh, same old, same old. You?
Yep.
So, where's Bethanne?
She won't be coming back.
What happened? Where is she?
Well, you were right.
We shouldn't have left.
No.
You hungry?
Next time, you'll listen to me.
I'm home.
Teeth brushed, ready for bed.
Safe and sound.
Oh, good. I'm glad.
Is everything all right?
You sound serious.
No,no.
Uh, not tonight.
You still have a few more minutes left of normal.
I'll pay you back tomorrow, ok?
I had a really nice time on our date tonight.
Such a liar.
No, I'm serious.
In a way, it was exactly what it was supposed to be.
I had a really nice time, too.
Could you help me out a little bit?
What the hell?
I could have killed you.
Yeah, but you didn't.
I should have.
But you didn't.
How did you know?
I knew this girl.
Vicki.
She, uh,
She was attacked by an animal,
A bite to the neck.
She started acting crazy.
You know, weird,
and it...and it seemed like drugs,
But then, you showed me those articles.
And then, I saw your face, and how it changed.
That night in the cemetery when I kissed you.
Look.
You know you can't tell anyone, right?
Ha. Who'd believe me?
You'd be surprised.
Why didn't you kill me?
I don't know.
Maybe I'm a sucker for guys like you.
Like what?
Lost.
Why would you confront me about it?
Why would you risk it?
Because if it was true maybe,
Maybe it's true about Vicki.
And also because...
