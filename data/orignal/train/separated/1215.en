Mona, we need your help.
We just found out that Ali's at the police station.
She's talking to the cops.
But I'm already number one on her hit list.
If Alison finds out I'm siding with you guys,
I'm afraid to think of how far she'd go to stop me.
We never had our talk.
I'm tired of talking.
Happy graduation.
Spence.
I love you.
I wonder if I can trust anyone in that family.
Did Alison know Bethany?
Where are you?
Wait, I can't hear you.
Spencer Hastings, you're under arrest for the murder of Bethany Young.
I-I-I didn't do this.
Where are we going?
To Mona's.
She found proof.
Oh, my God. Mona!
Although we did not find a body,
we have ruled this a homicide.
So what did you get for Toby?
I'm abstaining from Christmas this year, remember?
When you're out on bail for murder,
it just feels like the right thing to do.
And he's okay with that?
Well, he agreed to not giving presents
if I agreed to surprising each other with a gesture.
Like the clowns?
What clowns?
Court jesters. They're clowns, right?
I've always loved these windows.
Let's make a wish.
Yeah, let's make a wish for Spencer.
Guys, Santa is not bringing me a stay-out-of-jail-free card.
Han, want a snowflake?
The last time I was here, it was with Mona.
What'd you wish for?
You're my first friend, Hanna.
I wished for us to always stay close.
We will.
Besties forever.
I promise.
So what'd you wish for?
Jimmy Choos.
Oh, you're getting those.
I am?
If Santa doesn't bring 'em, we'll steal 'em.
Wishes don't come true, Emily.
If they did, people wouldn't die.
I'm still holding out hope.
Hope is a dirty four-letter word.
We live in an "A" world.
They still haven't found Mona's body.
Yeah, that's because
"A" likes to bury the bodies herself.
Yeah, and then throw Ice Balls.
I swear Alison is throwing this party
to rub it in our faces.
I ruined your lives and now I'm the belle of the ball.
Technically, she only ruined my life.
Ruin one of us, ruin all of us.
Yeah, I'd rather dance on dead monkeys
than go to Ali's stupid Ice Ball.
Dead monkeys?
Ali got everything she wanted.
Mona's gone, Bethany's dead,
and now she's making Spencer go down for it.
Is that a reporter or a cop?
Neither. That pen's too nice. My money's on a lawyer.
Hanna Marin?
Yes.
Told you.
Mona Vanderwaal retained me to handle her affairs in the event of her demise.
I was instructed to wait 30 days after her death,
then deliver this to you personally.
Merry Christmas.
Bah humbug.
I'm afraid to open it.
These are drawings of Ali's house.
Yeah, and all of her hiding places.
It's from Mona.
"Hey, Han. If you're reading this..."
She's still playing the game
and I'm talking to you from the grave.
But I went out fighting and that's what you need to do.
Promise me you won't give up, Hanna.
You have to keep looking.
Kisses, M.
I promised Mona we'd always stick together.
Well, you have to figure, "A" keeps souvenirs, right?
You mean Alison.
Different name, same bitch.
There has to be something in Ali's house that proves
she killed Bethany.
And Spencer didn't.
I think Mona just handed us a way
to give you a Christmas, Spence.
And your stay-out-of-jail-free card.
Hey, Santa.
Thank you.
Oh, my God.
Is that us?
"'A' takes a holiday.
You should, too."
Mom.
She's got a lot to show you.
Pay attention.
I know you'd told me never to leave the house
without my face on, but as a corpse,
this is the best I can do for your Ice Ball.
This isn't real.
You were quite the little pianist.
Is that me?
You don't remember?
It's not pretty.
But you need to see it.
See what?
Wait for it.
Alison!
I didn't mean to,
but I found your hiding place.
Did you and daddy give me the same present?
I don't know what you mean.
Daddy will think it's funny when I tell him.
There are not two dresses.
I think you need glasses.
You only saw one dress.
You found the present, one present.
You opened it and there was one dress.
Why, mommy?
Because I don't want daddy to leave us.
And he will, if you tell him about the dresses.
I'll say whatever you want me to.
Good girl.
Now tell me what happened.
The real story.
I was playing the piano.
I looked inside of it and found one present,
one yellow dress.
Good girl.
One more time.
I was playing the piano.
I looked inside of it and found one present,
one yellow dress.
And the monster was born.
Who was the other dress for?
Was it Bethany?
It's not going to be that easy, bitch.
Ali made hiding things into a game.
You're out on bail for a murder charge, Spencer.
Well, it's not a perfect plan,
but it's all I've got.
And I saw the look on my mom's face
after we met my lawyers for the last time.
We've already lost.
It's not over yet.
But, hey, what if Ali leaves the dance early?
She won't.
Aria and Emily are gonna find a reason
to keep her there.
And you will be here to warn us if anything goes wrong.
I thought everybody was splitting up on Christmas.
No, we're all gonna catch up with our parents
before the snow starts.
Mm, sounds like you've got it all figured out.
Toby, this might be my last Christmas.
Spencer...
So...
Merry-ho-ho.
Nice gesture.
Thanks.
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas to you, too.
Merry Christmas.
Okay, where's my friend Claire?
I haven't signed since fat camp.
My bunkmate was hard of hearing.
Merry Christmas.
What's wrong?
I'm pretty sure that some kid peed on me,
and that mean little girl,
she keeps calling me dumb-dumb.
What mean girl?
Ali's little mini-me.
Right there, there she is.
Call her anything you want.
She can't hear you.
Get over here.
All of you.
I'm only gonna say this once.
You mess with Claire, you deal with me.
I'm shaking with fear.
You better start looking over your shoulder,
because you're making a lot of enemies.
And in Rosewood, bitches get buried.
This place blows. Let's get out of here.
Hey, you guys, you don't need a leader.
You just need each other.
I said let's go!
Losers.
Well, I would say that
you put the fear of Hanna in her.
Well, Mona used to say when someone shows you
who they are, believe them.
I don't think people change, Caleb.
They just get better at hiding it.
But mean girls stay mean.
Cookie?
I know you wanted to keep it low-key this holiday,
but this is for tonight.
Is it an Ali-decoder ring?
Ezra, they're beautiful.
Thank you.
And Mandi at the boutique
said it might go well with this.
All right, if this is low-key,
I'm afraid to ask what full-on Christmas
looks like at the Fitzgerald house.
Oh, yeah, don't ask.
It's like how many ponies can you get?
Seriously?
No.
Ezra?
Well, I got two ponies, but I only asked for one.
Merry Christmas.
You got a minute?
What do you want?
So it looks like you and Paige worked things out.
Why doesn't Jenna come over here and talk to me?
And you don't have to be her eyes and ears.
She can still hear, right?
Jenna's not a bad person.
You just wouldn't know that because
Alison convinced you that she was the enemy.
Is that all?
All right, I just wanted to say Merry Christmas.
It's not what I want.
It's what you want.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
My parents want me to come to California after Christmas.
Well, that sounds like a fun winter break.
Look up.
Well, let's see how you look.
It's a Christmas miracle.
I still don't see Ali anywhere.
She's probably waiting to make her grand entrance.
Timed to the perfect song.
Well, we can't leave until she gets here, so...
I'm going to go have my picture taken with Santa Claus.
I think you know what I want for Christmas.
And I think you know I'll do whatever I can to help you get it.
Hanna and I are headed to her house
the second Ali gets here.
We'll make sure she stays here, Spencer.
You've been a very good girl this year.
Santa won't let you down.
Lucas...
Paige said that Ali was building her own army.
Be careful tonight.
We can't trust anyone.
Whoa, check it out!
Who are those other girls?
Let's get out of here while everyone's still basking in the glow of Ali.
Hanna.
Be careful.
Who is that?
Aren't you supposed to be on "A" watch?
Yeah. You need to see this.
What is it?
I just saw Ali kissing Santa Claus.
Come on.
Jeez, Hanna!
Do not sneak up on me like that.
I'm sorry.
Okay, if we're the only ones here, why are we whispering?
I don't know.
Can we just talk in a normal voice?
Because this is spooking me out.
Here, you take the upstairs.
I'll take the downstairs.
Okay, on a creepy scale,
how high would you rate breaking into Ali's house?
On a scale of 1 to 10, it's a 20.
They were just here.
Was it a guy or a girl?
Guy.
Are you sure?
Yes, I'm sure.
I definitely got a sense of "male butt."
Okay, well, I'm gonna go take my photo with Santa Claus.
Come in closer to Santa Claus.
Merry Christmas!
You're on my list, Aria.
The naughty one.
Surprised to see you here.
Yeah, not as surprised as I am to see you.
It's a charity ball.
Giving back to my community.
I didn't realize that Rosewood was your community.
The town has a lot to offer.
It's starting to grow on me.
That's spoken like a guy who maybe met a girl that he likes.
What brings you out tonight, Aria?
Same as you.
It feels good to give back.
I don't know why I have such a hard time believing you.
My boyfriend's probably looking for me.
That's a pretty dress.
Tell Ezra I think he has good taste.
Aria and Emily lost Alison.
Oh, well, I think I just found her.
Merry Christmas, Aly.
You don't need to be afraid.
I led you here,
because I don't want Alison to see us talking.
You really get around, Sydney.
Does Jenna know you're with Ali now?
When I first moved to Rosewood,
Alison offered to be my friend.
I made the mistake of saying no.
When she asked me this time
I gave her the right answer.
I promise you, we're not the enemy.
No, you're just sleeping with the enemy.
I'm not gay, Emily.
That's not what I meant.
Look, until someone puts Ali away,
we're doing what we have to do to survive.
I'm sure you and your friends understand that.
We think she killed Mona.
We do, too.
Alison?
There's this shop in Le Marais
that helps you make your own fragrance.
It's a tiny store,
but I spent the entire day there.
The owner gets you talking.
And the next thing you know, he's created a scent
that's perfect for the person you're telling him about.
Thank you.
Not just for the perfume, but for coming to see me.
When you lose someone,
the first Christmas is always the hardest.
I think my mom is still looking out for me.
I'm sure she is.
I had a dream about her the other night.
She came to warn me about Mona.
Mona can't hurt you anymore.
You know that.
You can't let your guard down, Ali.
Your ex-friends are here tonight.
And I don't think they came to say Merry Christmas.
What did you find, Hanna?
If the winds pick up,
we could be looking at blizzard conditions
for the Rosewood area on this blustery Christmas Eve.
But don't worry, kids, Santa has Rudolph
to navigate his sleigh.
Does the name Holly Varjak mean anything to you?
Spence?
What, Hanna?
If Ali needs to get out of town in a hurry,
she's ready to go as Holly Varjak.
She's writing her happy ending.
To what?
Breakfast at Tiffany's.
Probably the movie, not the book.
Ezra always says that she was his "Holly Golightly."
And Paul Varjak was the guy who convinced Holly
that it was okay to be loved.
So in Ali's manic mind, they got married.
How do you fit all of that information into your one head?
What are those?
Ali was talking to somebody through the personal ads.
Like she did with Mona back when Mona was "A."
If Ali was kissing Holbrook, that would explain a lot.
Yeah, like why Spencer's about to go on trial for murder
while Ali's weaving her way through a winter wonderland.
Ezra, what is it?
Well, if Holbrook is helping Ali,
I want to know when it started.
Oh, my God.
I promised Ali I wouldn't tell
because I thought I was protecting everyone.
But CeCe showed up in New York that night.
And Ali helped to get her out of the country.
You think Holbrook was in on it?
I think he helped CeCe escape.
And he did it for Ali.
Looks like Ali made a friend.
She went in there alone.
They're heading towards the exit.
So is Holbrook.
You guys follow Ali.
We've got Santa.
I'll grab Lucas.
Detective Holbrook.
May I have a word with you for a second?
Sure.
You're leaving your own party, Ali?
What's the rush?
Alison?
Get out of my stuff
or I'll kill you!
Where are you, Hanna?
What's wrong?
We think Ali left the party.
I tried calling Hanna but she's not picking up.
Damn it.
We're our way.
Hanna, you've got to get out of there.
Where did you go?
Mad Hatter?
Mad Hatter.
Hanna!
God, I only had one pen pal.
Ali had a fan club.
"Can't wait to see you."
Oh, my God.
Ali knew Bethany.
And she invited her here for Labor Day.
Damn it, where are you?
Spence?
Spencer?
Hanna?
Spencer?
Come on.
Come on, Hanna. Come on.
Hanna!
Hanna?
Come on.
Hanna?
Hey, please, please, please, wake up.
It's okay.
Oh, my God.
Are you okay?
Hanna?
It's okay, she's gone.
She's gone.
It's okay, she's gone.
You're okay.
Hey, you're okay.
Give mom and grandma Bea a big kiss for me.
And I promise I'll be on the road as soon as it's clear.
Thanks, Dad.
I love you, too.
This is amazing.
Hanna, this letter proves that Alison knew Bethany
and lured her here on Labor Day.
This could create enough reasonable doubt to clear Spencer.
I don't want to say the "H" word,
but I am feeling cautiously optimistic tonight.
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.
And her heart grew three sizes that day.
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.
*Hark the herald angels sing.*
*Glory to the newborn king*
How was the party?
Ignoring me won't make me go away.
It'll just make me mad.
I'm scared, okay?
Is that what you wanted to hear?
It wasn't as gratifying as I thought it was gonna be.
What do you want me to do?
What do you want me to say to make you go away?
Wait for it.
Tell me if Tiny Tim will live.
Do we have to watch this?
It's depressing.
If you think you're depressed now,
look over there.
When?
Does it matter?
It does to me.
And only you.
You look pretty good, considering
that they never found your legs.
Do I know you?
Mom.
It's all my fault.
Look at me.
I'm not dead.
They'll be coming for you soon.
I'm sorry.
Am I going to hell?
No. No.
No!
No!
Please!
Let me out!
Mona!
Mona!
Wake up, bitch!
It's Christmas.
And I promise you don't want to miss it.
My mom called her friend at Highway Patrol.
They don't expect the roads to be cleared until tomorrow.
I'm so sorry, Em.
This is the first time I won't be with my parents on Christmas.
Yeah, me too.
You know, my mom always said Christmas was wherever we were
as long as we were together.
And we are...
together.
Seriously?
Now that is a gesture.
Merry Christmas.
Oh, my God.
Hey, you okay?
My parents don't think Rosewood's a safe place anymore.
They don't want me to visit California,
they want me to move there.
Wait, before graduation?
I'll have enough credits by the end of spring quarter.
I just thought we had more time.
Mona should be here tonight.
The only reason we're celebrating is because of her.
Christmas chicken.
Yeah!
Okay, let's all say a prayer.
To this family.
May we always stay together.
Cheers.
Cheers.
Santa?
Oh, my God.
Who did this?
Em?
Not me.
Merry Christmas, bitches.
