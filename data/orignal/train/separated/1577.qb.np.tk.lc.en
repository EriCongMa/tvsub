as soon as i saw you , i knew there was no need for a dna test .
dear callie , i &apos;m your sister .
her name &apos;s sophia .
you were way better than her .
she only made the team because she &apos;s latin .
it doesn &apos;t even matter whether i &apos;m here or not .
well , congrats . it doesn &apos;t anymore .
hey , girls , change of plans .
party at mariana &apos;s tonight .
i know it &apos;s not true ,
but my dad won &apos;t let me sleep over at your house
because he thinks you &apos;re gay .
he was brilliant .
even got into the junior symphony . he got beaten up .
his hand was shattered .
ok , you need to get everybody out of the house now .
how am i supposed to do that , callie ?
play !
ok , that &apos;s why they &apos;re all here , isn &apos;t it ?
* ... winter , summer , fall *
* they &apos;re all washed up if you &apos;re still way over there *
* maybe slide on in by my side *
it sucks being the responsible one .
it was worth it , though , getting to hear you play again .
that first song , the only reason they played it was ...
i knew they &apos;d love it , and they did .
they are obviously still alive , right ?
and if they &apos;re having a party ,
we &apos;ll certainly find out about it soon enough .
all right , everybody . no mercy .
if we haven &apos;t used it in the last three years , it goes .
oh . hey , mom , remember this ?
oh , my god !
here , take this .
what is this ?
it &apos;s trash , trust me .
wait ! where are you going with that ?
i love that vase .
hey , hey , no mercy , remember ?
for the record , it was a pretty ugly vase .
if brandon wants to use this as a studio ,
brandon should clean it himself .
i am cleaning it , you &apos;re just helping me .
it &apos;s not gonna be just brandon &apos;s space .
this is gonna be a hangout space for everybody .
oh , no , no ! no heavy lifting , mama .
uh @-@ uh @-@ uh . you sort through these .
ugh ! geez ! thank you . thank you .
on second thought , i don &apos;t want you getting hantavirus .
why don &apos;t you go sit down and ... and be pretty .
go delegate from over there .
what &apos;s that ?
oh , i ... i put my family tree together when i was in college .
i traced my mom &apos;s lineage all the way back to africa .
why ?
i don &apos;t know .
i guess i was just curious , about my history .
i can &apos;t believe we kept all this crap .
you guys are lucky to have all this crap from when you were little .
you know , to remember stuff .
well , hey , i have the best memento of all .
oh , look who i found !
&quot; mikey the bikey ! &quot;
i &apos;m sorry , what did you just call that ?
mikey the bikey . we all learned how to ride on him .
don &apos;t you think we should keep that , for the baby to learn on ?
she &apos;s gotta start somewhere .
ok , wait . you just said &quot; she . &quot;
it &apos;s a girl ?
we were not supposed to say anything .
but yes , it is a girl .
outnumbered ! outnumbered ! you &apos;re outnumbered !
you &apos;re outnumbered ! you &apos;re outnumbered !
you are outnumbered !
so have you , uh , you talked to jude yet ?
no , i will . i just haven &apos;t had a chance .
ok .
wow . she looks just like you .
yeah .
you know , at first , i didn &apos;t think i wanted to meet her .
but then i couldn &apos;t stop thinking about her .
you know , it &apos;s not her fault that her dad ...
... my dad ... left mom , you know ?
it &apos;s weird when you say , &quot; your dad . &quot;
i know , i &apos;m sorry . i didn &apos;t mean ...
donald is our dad . ok ?
robert &apos;s just some guy i got some dna from .
what about sophia ?
well , she is just ...
... my half @-@ sister , i guess .
like i &apos;m your half @-@ brother ?
jude , you are my brother . period . ok ?
if you don &apos;t want me to meet sophia , i won &apos;t .
if you want to ...
... i think you should .
and you &apos;re ok with that ?
hey . i &apos;m sorry about the party .
i shouldn &apos;t have said i stood up to my dad when i just snuck out .
i just didn &apos;t wanna hurt your feelings .
but , you know ,
it wouldn &apos;t even matter if i did stand up to my dad ,
&apos;cause it &apos;s not like i have a say . in anything .
so , uh , when do you think we &apos;ll have an answer ?
about the new principal , i mean ?
well , the final interviews with the search committee are tomorrow ,
so soon , i hope .
well , you got my vote .
you &apos;ve been doing a great job since karina left .
thank you .
what &apos;s up ?
um , i just wanted to let you know that i &apos;ve hired an attorney
to represent my interests regarding the baby .
i didn &apos;t want you to be surprised when he gets in touch .
you &apos;re kidding , right ?
i think it &apos;s best if we let them do the talking from now on .
let &apos;s go !
hey . what &apos;s going on ? did i just see april crying outside ?
oh , probably , yeah .
she &apos;s off the team .
she is ?
yeah , it &apos;s kinda your fault .
it &apos;s what ?
i &apos;m kidding .
i mean , mostly . she got completely faded at your party , and ...
she wasn &apos;t the only one .
she &apos;s the only one whose pics are up online ,
looking completely trashed .
she broke the code , so she &apos;s out .
but kaitlyn was ...
mariana , don &apos;t poke the beast . seriously .
ok , so listen up . april &apos;s out , so we need to fill her spot , asap .
yes ?
um , are we sure we wanna let april go ?
i mean , she &apos;s one of our best dancers , and honestly ,
everyone had a pretty good time the other night .
april &apos;s behavior reflected badly on all of us , so she &apos;s out .
so we &apos;re having an emergency
audition session tomorrow after school ,
so spread the word , ok ?
nice crossface .
thanks .
relax , foster , it &apos;s cool .
we don &apos;t need to make things weird .
so it didn &apos;t work out . we can be friends , right ?
teammates ?
right .
jesus , let &apos;s go .
so has your brother said anything about me ?
who , brandon ?
no .
jesus ? um , no , why ?
well , we ... we kinda hooked up at your party ,
and he said he was gonna call me and he , like , hasn &apos;t .
you hooked up with hayley ?
no ! who said that ?
she did . i can &apos;t believe
you hooked up with another one of my friends !
what the hell is wrong with you ?
i mean , why can &apos;t you just date some girl
in science club or something . god , jesus !
science club ? really ?
relax . it was a one @-@ time thing .
oh , it better not be . hayley really likes you .
she &apos;s upset you haven &apos;t called .
so you want me to call ?
yeah !
i &apos;m not gonna let you be some douche who , like ,
mows through girls faster than mom &apos;s weedwacker . call her .
sisters , right ? what a pain .
i really wanna be with you .
i &apos;m sorry , i didn &apos;t mean to pressure you .
no , it &apos;s not that . it &apos;s just , um ...
having sex is a violation of my parole .
seriously ?
they can do that ?
yeah , they can do a lot of things .
so how long you gonna be on probation again ?
um ... you don &apos;t have to wait , or anything .
like , if you wanna ...
no , no , i was making a joke .
it &apos;s good . i can wait .
i &apos;d wait forever for you .
you know the reason i came back from indiana
wasn &apos;t &apos; cause i hated it there , right ?
i mean , them hoosiers are some very nice people .
what i hated was being somewhere you weren &apos;t .
because i love you .
it &apos;s nice .
is that a new song ?
uh , no .
i &apos;m just finding an ending to an old one .
so i decided i &apos;m gonna meet my sister .
uh , half @-@ sister .
oh , yeah ?
well , you tell jude ?
mm @-@ hm . he &apos;s cool with it .
it &apos;s kinda just how he is , though .
hey . sorry i &apos;m late .
you &apos;re not late .
hell , i should leave then , come back in an hour .
hey , lou .
hey .
ok . well , um , i should leave you guys to it . have fun .
so , what &apos;s up there ?
what do you mean ?
it &apos;s pretty obvious you two have a history .
or maybe a &quot; present . &quot;
uh , she &apos;s my sister .
but you &apos;re not related .
you know what ?
i hate when people say that .
adopted siblings are related , ok ?
sorry . she &apos;s not adopted .
callie .
yet . right ?
not legally , but we are a family .
i mean , she &apos;s just as much my sister as mariana is .
ok .
so , what do you want to work on ?
how about the song that we did at the party ?
what was it called , &quot; outlaws &quot; ?
uh , it &apos;s pretty great .
i thought if we dirtied it up a little bit ,
we could add it to the setlist .
actually , that song isn &apos;t really for the band .
why not ?
it &apos;s just personal .
you don &apos;t think &quot; ape man love machine &quot; is personal ?
did you , uh , write it for someone special ?
no . i ... i ... i just had other plans for it .
yeah ? well , i had other plans for the band ,
which didn &apos;t involve you . but things change .
wow . have you heard of this , the &quot; word gap ? &quot;
so babies who aren &apos;t talked to enough
are headed for trouble in school from the get @-@ go .
like basically your entire ability to learn is wrapped up
in how many words you hear in your first years of life .
yeah . makes sense .
but with the two of us for moms ,
i don &apos;t think our child is gonna have anything to worry about .
what ? you talk a lot .
oh , i do ?
yes , you do .
although ...
you really don &apos;t have a lot to say about this timothy situation .
honey , i love you , and i hear you ,
but i have a really big day tomorrow .
i have to go in front of the school board , which timothy is on ,
and nail my interview , and i just ...
i really don &apos;t wanna get worked up about
how much his timing just sucks .
and to top of it ,
i have to deal with this visit to the quinns tomorrow .
well , just use it as an opportunity to suss him out .
oh , i &apos;m planning to .
i mean , besides stalking her at work ,
don &apos;t you think giving callie that letter from sophia
was a little manipulative ?
and why hasn &apos;t he signed the abandonment papers ?
what &apos;s that about ?
lawyers slow everything down ,
you know that .
i &apos;m so sick of lawyers .
and timothy &apos;s timing is impeccable , and strategic .
you have something he wants , and he has something you want .
you think he deliberately sicked his attorney on us
the day before my interview ?
look , respectfully , i think we &apos;ve gotten off track
under karina &apos;s leadership .
if you look in the folders in front of you ,
you &apos;ll find my academic and financial plan
to re @-@ focus anchor beach on our original mission statement :
to educate , cultivate , and motivate well @-@ rounded kids
who are engaged in their community
with a focus on protecting the environment .
that &apos;s why we chose this location ,
with the most extraordinary laboratory in our backyard :
the pacific ocean .
i think it &apos;s time to return to our roots ,
and to bring anchor beach back to greatness .
and i believe that i can provide the leadership to do that .
thank you , lena . nice job .
but how exactly are you planning on
returning the school to greatness
when you &apos;ve been cutting programs
ever since you took over as interim principal ?
i inherited a deficit .
so as vice @-@ principal ,
you were unaware of the financial status of the school ?
no . i was fully aware that things were tight .
the government cut a few programs last year ,
but when we lost the cerars ,
we lost our biggest donors .
which is why karina was reluctant to expel their son ,
and why she lost her job .
well , i think you &apos;ve done a terrific job .
you &apos;ve made some tough calls ,
but i can &apos;t find fault with any of your decisions .
just one last thing . as you &apos;ve disclosed , you &apos;re pregnant ?
yes .
and what &apos;s your due date ?
and how long are you expecting to be on maternity leave ?
well , i &apos;m fairly certain you didn &apos;t ask
any of the male applicants that question , but , um ...
ok , jude .
what &apos;s the study of how living things are classified ?
come on , you know this one .
say the first thing that comes to mind .
ok , who else can answer ?
taxonomy .
that &apos;s correct . what makes up the human genome ?
five , six , seven , eight .
wow . jenna &apos;s really good .
yeah .
she &apos;s kaitlyn &apos;s friend ?
why &apos;d we even have auditions ?
i mean , why didn &apos;t she make the team last time ?
&apos;cause you were better , duh .
really ?
good job , jenna .
just make sure you punctuate that kick at the end .
so it &apos;s really ... here .
ok , next group . let &apos;s see what you &apos;ve got so far .
is this some sort of quid @-@ pro @-@ quo ?
i get your vote as long as we agree to share custody with you ?
&apos;cause that &apos;s not gonna happen .
honestly , lena , it &apos;s nothing like that .
well , your timing would suggest otherwise .
i &apos;m not bartering with my child .
i &apos;m sorry you think i &apos;m such a horrible person ,
but i can tell you i will be 100 percent objective ...
forgive me if i have a hard time taking you at your word .
you volunteered to be our donor .
you said that people like us should have kids ,
and you wanted to help , anonymously . and then you ...
i read the contract .
yes .
and you knew what it was going to say .
you agreed that stef and i should be the parents .
i thought we were friends .
i trusted you because i thought you had integrity .
i do .
no .
people with integrity , they honor their word ,
even when it &apos;s not convenient ,
even when they change their minds .
you can &apos;t just say that you have integrity ,
you have to act like it .
ok , that &apos;s five for tia ,
and one for jenna ?
it wasn &apos;t me . i voted for tia .
you voted for jenna ?
oh , yeah .
i mean , tia &apos;s totally the best dancer ,
but do you really think she &apos;s the best dancer for the team ?
what do you mean ?
i mean , do you think she &apos;s really gonna blend in ?
that &apos;s all i was thinking .
why wouldn &apos;t she ? because she &apos;s black ?
oh , my god , no ! no , not that . no . i ...
i just ... maybe she &apos;s too good ?
and what ? she &apos;s gonna make the rest of us look bad ?
no !
no , i just ... i thought &apos; cause jenna was kaitlyn &apos;s friend ...
we don &apos;t vote for our friends ,
we vote for the best dancer .
right .
well , then i vote for tia , too .
great . it unanimous then .
unanimous .
what ?
nothing .
ok , well , let &apos;s all take tia to coffee .
get her to know her a little better .
we can &apos;t . mariana and i have plans after school .
right .
you doing all right ?
yeah , i &apos;m fine . good .
a little nervous , maybe .
honestly , i &apos;m not even sure why i agreed to do this .
curiosity . we all wanna know
what makes us who we are , biologically , you know ?
i think that &apos;s gotta be one of the hardest things
when you &apos;re adopted .
the rest of us , we wanna know something like
why are my knees bad ,
or how come i can &apos;t sing , we just ask our parents .
and they tell us , &quot; yeah , well ,
that &apos;s what happens to your knees , and it &apos;s only gonna get worse . &quot;
or &quot; none of us coopers can sing . &quot;
and &quot; you really can &apos;t do that . &quot;
so it &apos;s ok . it &apos;s ok to wanna know .
what if they don &apos;t wanna know me ?
well , they asked you here , didn &apos;t they ?
you ready ? let &apos;s do this .
hey ! so how &apos;d your interview go ?
oh ! you know what ? there was a tricky moment or two ,
but i kinda think i killed it .
nice ! you &apos;re totally gonna get it .
what about you ?
how was your dance auditions ? did you guys find your girl ?
oh , yeah . we did . you know tia stephens ?
she &apos;s a junior , i think .
oh , yeah , she seems like a sweet girl .
yeah , yeah , she is . and , you know , she &apos;s black , so that &apos;s good .
why is that good ?
oh , well , just &apos; cause , you know , diversity and all that .
what do you mean ?
well , don &apos;t you , like , have rules about clubs and teams
having to pick some brown kids , too ?
you mean like quotas ? no .
no , we certainly encourage diversity .
because when kids from different ethnic and religious
and cultural backgrounds come together
it &apos;s been proven that it enriches learning and creativity .
ok , relax , mom , i &apos;m not part of the search committee .
you don &apos;t have to give me the principal speech .
what &apos;s going on ?
i don &apos;t know .
i guess just for the diverse person it just makes them feel
like they got a hand @-@ out or a leg up or something .
are you feeling that way ?
no . no , no .
i just ... i don &apos;t want tia to feel that way .
you know , because she &apos;s a really good dancer .
ok . well , you just do your best to make sure she doesn &apos;t .
yeah , i will .
so hayley &apos;s coming over , if that &apos;s cool ?
yeah , sure . you guys have fun .
great .
so you &apos;re 16 ?
mm @-@ hm .
what sign are you ?
cancer .
what ? me , too !
wait , when &apos;s your birthday ? june or july ?
it &apos;s july 11th .
july 15th !
oh , my god , that &apos;s crazy .
sophia .
oh , my gosh . sorry .
your mom was a gemini , right ?
yeah .
more iced tea ?
uh , no , thank you .
any more caffeine and i &apos;m gonna shake apart .
so how long has callie been with you and your partner ?
wife , they &apos;re married .
that &apos;s great .
we had a little marriage equality fundraiser here a couple of years ago .
oh , that &apos;s nice . thank you .
um , well , callie and jude came to us about ...
um , it was over six months ago .
little over six months .
that &apos;s terrific . you have , what , two , three other kids ?
three other kids .
were you looking for more kids ? was that the plan ?
uh , no , actually . we weren &apos;t .
but , uh , but we fell in love with them .
how did they get placed with you ? i &apos;m not ...
well , my ...
i was in juvie ,
and my case worker thought
that i would do better in a house with no male authority figures .
why ?
oh , no , sophia , that &apos;s not ...
it &apos;s ok .
my brother jude and i were in a foster home with ...
with an unfit foster father .
well , i think it &apos;s terrific
that you &apos;ve taken them in and are adopting them .
well , jude and callie have been an incredible gift to us , all of us .
um , hey , can i take callie upstairs ?
i wanna show her my room .
yeah , of course . sure , honey .
i mean , if she wants to .
yeah , great .
ok .
so when are you planning on adopting her ?
uh , well , as soon as your husband signs the paperwork .
we &apos;re just waiting on him .
you won all these ?
yeah .
i was kinda one of those horse girls for a while .
not anymore ?
no . not so much .
i mean , i still have my horse ,
but i don &apos;t get to ride that often .
why not ?
you know , school , activities ,
sat prep , all that stuff .
you &apos;re taking sat prep ?
aren &apos;t you a freshman ?
oh , yeah .
but my school , and my family ,
think all that stuff is super important . so ...
you like horses ?
um ... i &apos;ve never been on one .
really ? well , let me take you riding sometime .
i mean , it &apos;s super fun ,
when you &apos;re not like competing and trying to win and all that .
but you always were ? competing , i mean ?
yeah .
so , what do you do for fun ?
school &apos;s fun , i guess .
what about you ?
i play guitar ,
and i hang out with my boyfriend .
wait , you have a boyfriend ?
what &apos;s his name ?
uh , wyatt .
is it serious ? do you , like , love him ?
i do , actually .
yeah . just haven &apos;t told him yet .
why not ?
there was someone else that i loved ,
not all that long ago .
and just saying those words to wyatt
makes me feel like i &apos;m , i don &apos;t know , betraying him .
i know it &apos;s over , so ...
yeah , we should , um ...
yeah , yeah , you should go .
but can we hang out again ? like , soon ?
we could go riding , or to a movie , or shopping .
i really love what you have on .
oh , um , yeah , you , too . that &apos;s a cool jacket .
thanks .
great . so let &apos;s go shopping .
yeah , i &apos;d like that .
hey , i want you to meet my dog .
he &apos;s seriously , like , the cutest thing ever .
ok .
i was just so shocked when i found out about callie .
i guess i needed to see her for myself .
i know it was inappropriate , and i am sorry .
i just couldn &apos;t believe colleen had a baby and never told me .
but then i thought about it , and ...
... she was probably afraid of what my family might do .
like what ?
like try and take the baby from her ,
get some kind of custody rights .
they would have done that ?
you know , i met colleen when ...
... when i was home from grad school .
and she worked at the beach club that my family belonged to .
and we ... we fell in love .
but my family just assumes
anyone who isn &apos;t from some money is a gold @-@ digger .
which , by the way ,
are why these abandonment papers are taking so long .
anyway , we eloped ,
thinking we could make a go of it ,
but once my parents found out , i ...
it got ugly .
i &apos;m ashamed to admit that i ...
i couldn &apos;t stand up to the pressure from my dad .
i was young , and , uh ...
anyway , i eventually gave in ,
and let him have the marriage dissolved .
it is without a doubt the single greatest regret of my life .
i loved colleen very much ,
and if i had any idea that she was pregnant ,
i never would &apos;ve left .
um , i found them , they were playing with the dog .
but sophia has a ton of homework , so ...
yeah . of course . we should get home .
i &apos;ll go tell the girls .
i &apos;m sorry . this hasn &apos;t been easy on my wife .
i understand .
there &apos;s something else i &apos;ve been thinking about . i , um ...
i &apos;d like to set up a college fund for callie , if that &apos;s ok ?
um ... well , that &apos;s very nice .
i would need to discuss it with my wife ,
but that &apos;s very generous , thank you .
it &apos;s nothing . i &apos;d be honored , really .
i feel like i owe her something .
after all , she is my daughter .
i hope it &apos;s ok i told the girls we had plans .
i just , i don &apos;t want them all up in my business .
oh . yeah , totally .
jesus should be here soon . i &apos;m glad he called you .
can i borrow your toothbrush ?
um , sure ? it &apos;s the purple one right there .
hey , so , um , something &apos;s been bugging me .
since i got on the team , i overheard kaitlyn tell jenna
that it was just because i &apos;m , you know , diverse .
but i was talking to my mom ,
and she told me there aren &apos;t quotas or anything .
and i know i &apos;m not a better dancer than jenna .
truth ?
yes , please .
you maybe had a little advantage because your mom &apos;s principal .
well , she &apos;s not yet .
well , she &apos;s gonna be .
and with all the programs and clubs they &apos;ve been cutting ,
we just thought that ...
she &apos;d never cut the dance team
if her daughter was on it .
so i &apos;m like an insurance policy .
great , i &apos;m the geico lizard of the dance team .
no , it &apos;s not like that .
ok , but so what ?
i mean , everyone uses whatever advantages they &apos;ve got , right ?
and you &apos;re so much better now ,
you could almost make the team anyway .
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m sure you are .
i voted for you .
after all but sabotaging me with those questions ?
especially about my pregnancy .
so that you could address it .
it was on people &apos;s minds , and you handled it perfectly .
everyone was very impressed with your presentation .
if i didn &apos;t get this because i &apos;m pregnant , that &apos;s illegal .
that &apos;s not why . they want new blood .
and the worst part ,
the woman who got it isn &apos;t even really an educator .
she &apos;s corporate .
if it &apos;s any consolation , all the teachers fought for you .
and , uh ... this is for you .
i &apos;m glad you called .
me , too .
i mean , i don &apos;t hook up with just anybody .
me neither .
i had my eye on you at the gym .
and i saw you looking at me .
all the guys look at you . you know that , right ?
yeah .
you could have any guy you want .
well , i want you .
but , um , maybe it &apos;s best
if we don &apos;t tell anyone about this .
at least not right now . you &apos;re great . i ...
i just don &apos;t wanna deal with a
bunch of gossip and teasing from the dance girls .
and honestly , i &apos;d kinda rather my ex not find out about us yet .
are you still into him ?
no .
what about you ? are you over emma ?
yeah . of course .
hey . i thought hayley was coming over .
oh , uh , she &apos;s upstairs .
i was just getting us a little snackeroo .
ok , nothing with too much sugar , ok ?
hey , so you &apos;re not gonna be making any more budget cuts , are you ?
like , to dance ? &apos; cause i &apos;m really into it .
it &apos;s really not up to me anymore .
wait , what ? why not ?
i didn &apos;t get the principal job .
what ? no , i thought you killed it .
i did kill it . but they just decided to go with someone else .
they can &apos;t !
honey , i appreciate you being upset for me ,
but it &apos;s what it is .
it &apos;s not fair .
well , look on the bright side .
now the other kids can &apos;t get mad at you
because your mom &apos;s the one making budget cuts .
do you think the new principal is gonna be making cuts ?
i have no idea .
oh , could you get that , please ?
sure .
hey .
is jesus home ?
um ... no , he isn &apos;t . i &apos;m sorry .
will you tell him i stopped by ?
sure .
the kids told me .
i &apos;m so sorry . they &apos;re idiots .
not the kids , the ... the search committee .
i really wanted this .
i know you did , baby . i know .
did they say why ?
new blood .
they think i &apos;m tainted by karina .
oh , please .
i know they could never admit this , but
i have to wonder if me being pregnant has something to do with it .
timothy even asked me about my maternity leave during the interview .
of course he did , ass that he is .
maybe not as big an ass as we thought .
he signed the donor agreement .
what ? you &apos;re kidding ! are you kidding me ?
no .
why ? did he say why ?
i don &apos;t know . turns out he has some integrity after all ?
i didn &apos;t get a chance to ask him .
well , at least some good news after all , huh ?
yeah .
maybe it &apos;s ...
maybe it &apos;s for the best .
you know , i won &apos;t be under so much stress
and i can take a longer maternity leave .
the one consolation ...
... to losing this job is ...
we get to have this beautiful baby .
which is so much better .
yes .
so how were the , uh ...
how were the quinns ?
oh ! they were , uh , nice enough .
although i think , uh , mrs. quinn is a little freaked out about all of this .
what &apos;d she say ?
nothing .
but why wouldn &apos;t she be ?
robert , uh ...
robert wants to set up a college fund for callie .
wow ! really ?
i just ...
i don &apos;t know , something about it
makes me feel a little uncomfortable .
you know , would it be a bad thing ?
a college fund ? no .
no , sorry . timothy .
letting him be a part of the baby &apos;s life .
not as a father , but as ,
a donor , and a friend .
i just , i saw how callie was
so taken with robert and sophia , and i get it .
everyone wants to know their history .
and are we really gonna keep that a secret from our child ?
as long as he &apos;s not asking to be the dad ,
isn &apos;t a little more love and support a good thing ?
maybe we could find even little room ...
... for that . i don &apos;t ...
i don &apos;t know .
what &apos;s she like ?
she &apos;s cool .
yeah ?
kinda young , maturity wise .
but , um , i like her .
you gonna see her again ?
i am , yeah .
we have plans to go horseback riding , i think .
so listen , um , is it cool if the band starts playing &quot; outlaws ? &quot;
it &apos;s just , lou really digs the song ,
and so do the guys ...
brandon , it &apos;s not up to me .
you wrote it .
yeah , i know .
but i wrote it for you .
i know it sounds stupid , but ...
i don &apos;t know , i felt like i was ...
betraying something ?
yeah .
let lou have the song .
you called ?
yeah , thanks for coming .
i didn &apos;t ...
i didn &apos;t wanna say this over the phone .
i love you , too .
callie , come here a second .
uh , yeah ?
um , when &apos;s the last time you spoke to jude ?
um , i don &apos;t know , this morning , i think .
more specifically , when was the last time he spoke to you ?
so i , um , i got a call from barbara , your science teacher .
she said that you refused to speak in class today .
did something happen ?
is everything ok ?
jude , what &apos;s going on ?
jude , talk to me .
