my father was an innocent man ,
destroyed by powerful people .
the graysons are behind this , and they &apos;re gonna pay .
i &apos;ve dedicated my life to avenging his death ...
eventually , someone &apos;s gonna find you out .
and i won &apos;t stop until they &apos;ve all paid the price .
i &apos;ve been collecting names of grayson global employees .
one of them will be willing to share their account .
thanks for meeting with me , ms. davis .
it &apos;s lydia .
i &apos;m not gonna help you break up their engagement .
regret will haunt you , if you let daniel go .
i want to tell you my plan for august 8th--
the day victoria goes down for the murder
of emily thorne .
i &apos;m not asking you to commit to anything .
i just can &apos;t commit to emily ,
not when i feel this way about you .
i went to the doctor .
are you okay ?
we &apos;re pregnant .
when facing your enemy ,
no amount of training can trump nature .
it separates the strong from the weak .
and sometimes it tell us
that surrender is the strongest move of all .
let her go .
right there . very nice .
big smiles .
yeah , that &apos;s nice , looking at each other .
beautiful .
closer .
right behind her .
very nice .
lovely .
we got it !
all right . next , is the di santo ,
which we &apos;ll be shooting at the stables in 30 .
that lhuillier fits you impeccably , emily--
like it was made for you .
well , all of the dresses have been beautiful today so far .
only 48 hours until the world gets to see
the perfect one you &apos;ve chosen for your big day .
now aren &apos;t there some questions you should be asking
instead of just gushing over my fiance , jess ?
of course .
so tell me , boss ,
how does a man like daniel grayson
take a back seat in all the nuptial preparations ?
by admitting i don &apos;t know the first thing
about planning a wedding .
oh , he &apos;s being modest .
daniel actually selected the color scheme , the venue ...
the cake .
and what are your plans for the days that follow ?
where will you be residing , for instance ?
or when will you be needing a nursery ?
well--
the wedding &apos;s been our main focus .
one thing at a time . all right ?
we &apos;ll be right out .
i don &apos;t know how long i can keep our little secret .
not that i want to tell a journalist before your parents .
well , let &apos;s just keep it quiet until after the wedding .
i don &apos;t want it to overshadow your day .
besides , i thought you preferred to avoid all this publicity .
i don &apos;t know . for some reason , i &apos;m just bursting to tell the world .
mm . well , the truth is ,
&quot; voulez &quot; has put so much into this article
that changing it now would ...
throw the issue into chaos .
and we can &apos;t take that risk .
emily , i need you in that di santo , please .
hopefully ,
these new accommodations will suit your tastes .
anything would be better than that motel you caged me in .
i &apos;ve had handbags bigger than that room .
and where &apos;s my per diem ?
just call room service .
i &apos;m not talking carbs .
i &apos;m talking cartier .
i &apos;ve told you , you &apos;re not to go out in public .
i need to protect my source until my story is finished .
your story ?
you &apos;d still be asking useless questions about nolan ross
if i hadn &apos;t reached out .
and i &apos;ll be grateful if there is , in fact , truth
to the conspiracy theory that david clarke was framed .
but without telling me who was behind it
and finding me someone who can corroborate your claim ,
our story is nothing but a common myth ,
and i won &apos;t print that .
i &apos;ll need a list of people who can back you up ,
and their connection to what happened .
no good ever comes from dredging up the past--
especially ours .
well , as difficult as it may be
for either of us to remember , my dear ,
we had some good times .
oh , that would call into question your definition of &quot; good . &quot;
as you can see , in lieu of a proper muse ,
i &apos;m forced to turn to photographs
to rouse my recollection for my memoirs .
do you care to take a trip with me down memory lane ?
oh , my goodness ,
look how beautiful and innocent he was .
had we even settled on a name yet ?
no .
daniel was still &quot; baby boy grayson . &quot;
and now he &apos;s marrying that charlatan .
oh ... this again .
listen , after your little stunt at emily &apos;s bridal luncheon ,
you are one loosely veiled speech away from the looney bin .
reel it in , victoria .
i was showing him the truth .
just let him be .
your other son became a murderer after only six months with you .
you know , the time has come for you to stop this foolish interfering .
trust me .
i have every confidence
that with his heart yearning for another ,
our baby boy will put an end to emily himself .
婚礼主题
oh , so being busy at work isn &apos;t just an excuse ?
look ...
sara , i &apos;m not avoiding you , okay ? it &apos;s just--
it &apos;s been a week .
you know , every day i wear this , i feel worse .
if you &apos;re not ready to leave emily , then ...
i &apos;m not gonna wait around . okay , i &apos;m not that girl .
i &apos;m not asking you to be .
it &apos;s just things with emily are a little ...
they &apos;re a little more complicated than you know .
yeah , well , it looks picture @-@ perfect to me .
this is all just show , okay ? it &apos;s ...
&quot; voulez &apos;s &quot; start has been less than ideal .
and a spread like this sells magazines , which i need .
yeah , well , i need to stop feeling like the other woman .
so make up your damn mind .
sara , come ...
sara .
there &apos;s the blushing bride .
i would offer you a cocktail , if you weren &apos;t with child .
has the package arrived yet ?
no , not till tomorrow .
what &apos;s wrong ?
daniel &apos;s wavering . he &apos;s been distant all week .
the baby boom didn &apos;t knock him off the fence ,
back into your arms ?
unfortunately , no .
he &apos;s still in contact with sara .
i think he &apos;s keeping the pregnancy a secret
so she doesn &apos;t leave him .
that &apos;s the whole reason you played that card
in the first place .
so ...
leak the story .
he &apos;ll know it was me .
and i can &apos;t risk losing his trust again .
you also can &apos;t risk losing him to sara .
maybe it &apos;s time we start using more drastic measures .
not yet .
i &apos;m meeting with victoria tonight
to finalize the seating arrangements .
i guess i &apos;ll ...
figure out a way to deal with it then .
did you get what i asked for ?
are you sure about this ?
it &apos;s not part of her plan .
yes , i &apos;m sure .
thank you .
it looks good , ross .
now i just need one more thing--
your advice .
well , now where to seat mr. ross ?
hmm . i would say with your other friends ,
but you don &apos;t seem to have any .
i &apos;d like to find a place for nolan at the main table ,
seeing as he is walking me down the aisle .
oh , none for me , thanks .
oh , don &apos;t tell me that you &apos;ve suddenly become
a bride obsessed with her figure .
the wedding is less than two days away , my dear .
the damage is already done .
no , nothing like that .
you know , emily , you surprise me .
after learning her fiancé was in the arms of another ,
most self @-@ respecting women would call things off .
and many wives would leave their husbands ,
and yet , here we are .
am i to assume that you addressed this with daniel ?
daniel is going to be my husband
and the father of my children .
i &apos;ll address it the way i see fit .
your ignoring the problem will only make matters worse .
i can assure you .
victoria ?
what the hell ?
lydia ?
don &apos;t just stand there . zip me up .
what in the hell are you doing here ?
giving your wardrobe some much @-@ needed editing .
you all right , dear ?
you look like you &apos;ve seen a ghost .
well , you &apos;ve certainly proved resilient before , lydia .
i don &apos;t know why i should be surprised .
i take it you saved her .
i &apos;m beginning to question the wisdom of my mercy .
emily , would you please excuse us ?
not only is the man of the house absent ,
but his clothes are noticeably missing from his closets .
do i detect trouble in paradise ?
we had a deal . you were never to come out of hiding .
neither were you .
i should have known better than to trust the ice queen .
when i bartered the evidence against conrad
for charlotte &apos;s safety and was forced to exit that plane ,
i didn &apos;t have to take you with me , lydia .
you owe me your life .
some life .
i &apos;m slinging drinks for honeymooners in ecuador ,
while you &apos;re the first lady of new york ?
you didn &apos;t save me . you got rid of me .
i did disappear .
but my children were menaced again ,
and i had no choice .
and after the hell conrad put me through ,
i regret ever having left that plane .
because of him ,
i &apos;ve become just as much a prisoner of these walls .
maybe we should switch .
if it &apos;s retribution you &apos;re seeking ,
perhaps you &apos;ve forgotten who &apos;s to blame .
oh , victoria .
still so damn good at pointing that finger of yours .
i &apos;m well aware that conrad owes me big .
keep my little drop @-@ in between us ...
and maybe i &apos;ll go easy on you .
low returns like these are expected early
in a publication &apos;s life .
it took three years for my father
to turn a profit with european &quot; voulez . &quot;
we &apos;ll do it in one .
oh , i have a few surprises up my sleeve , mr. sullivan .
i assure you , you won &apos;t be disappointed .
okay , i must go . thank you . merci .
so this mr. sullivan is the reason you keep canceling on me ?
what &apos;s he got that i don &apos;t ?
he buys 16 pages of advertising per issue .
sure , but can he do this ?
probably .
just not as well .
that &apos;s what i thought .
what &apos;s in the bag , romeo ?
well , three rescheduled dinners worth of food .
i hope you &apos;re hungry .
i &apos;m sorry . last week &apos;s been crazy .
yeah . that &apos;s okay .
what is it ?
nothing . i just thought the stowaway
had a messy filing system .
it &apos;s lucky you have an excellent chef , mr. porter ,
or i &apos;d call mr. sullivan back .
great music .
thanks .
charlotte ?
hey , um ... can we talk ?
yeah , of course . what &apos;s up ?
listen , uh ...
i really appreciate everything you &apos;ve done for me .
but ... things aren &apos;t working out .
tell jack i &apos;m sorry .
is this because of daniel ?
am i that obvious ?
i still love him , charlotte .
i know he &apos;s getting married in two days .
you &apos;re the maid of honor ,
and you probably think i &apos;m awful . i--
i don &apos;t even know what i &apos;m saying .
i was trying to quit .
and i &apos;m not gonna let you .
i &apos;ve always thought you two belonged together .
maybe daniel just needs a little push .
oh , trust me .
it &apos;s too late . he &apos;s already made up his mind .
you let me be the judge of that .
are you sure ?
daniel , she &apos;s upstairs with your mother right now .
yeah , how is that even possible ?
it &apos;s really quite a story .
i can &apos;t believe it .
and i can &apos;t believe you &apos;re marrying this one .
so i guess that makes us even .
can you explain this ?
we &apos;ll talk about it later .
oh , don &apos;t let me keep you .
as much as i love rehashing the past ,
a girl needs her beauty rest .
it was lovely seeing you again , lydia .
save it .
they may still be falling for that little act of yours ,
but not me .
oh , lydia .
i think you &apos;ve pretty much cornered the market on falling ,
don &apos;t you think ?
daniel .
are you all right ?
hey , come here .
yeah , i &apos;m--i &apos;m sure .
are you sure ? i &apos;m calling the doctor .
daniel , you &apos;re overreacting . she &apos;s fine .
mom , she &apos;s pregnant .
come on . you okay ?
sorry , victoria .
i didn &apos;t want you to find out this way ,
but ... you &apos;re gonna be a grandmother .
what could possibly be so important
as to require my presence in your bedroom ?
well , our son is getting married tomorrow .
and since i have no clue as to what color
my date will be wearing ,
i don &apos;t know if i should go for the pearl or the bone .
which would keep us from clashing ?
no tie in the world could accomplish that .
the bone .
you missed quite a revelation last night .
did you dig up another selfless deed from emily &apos;s past ?
another selfish act , rather .
emily announced that she &apos;s with child .
that &apos;s marvelous .
don &apos;t be ridiculous .
she &apos;s lying .
why ?
to trap daniel into marrying her one day before their wedding ?
i &apos;m thrilled .
and may even lead with happy news
of the next grayson generation ...
when i talk with &quot; time &quot; magazine .
oh , they &apos;re interested in you ?
must be a slow news year .
well , there &apos;s even talk of a cover .
and when exactly did this invitation present itself ?
oh , just this morning .
well , i must admit that you definitely earned
what &apos;s coming to you .
lydia davis was my father &apos;s secretary .
she betrayed him for a life in the hamptons ,
so ... i took it away from her .
but she didn &apos;t go down without a fight .
five storeyes down , to be exact .
luckily , her tumble
provided us enough time to tie up a loose end .
loose end ?
she found a photo at a grayson party .
i was in the background .
pre @-@ emily thorne / amanda clarke--
all brunette bangs and bad attitude .
nolan fixed it before she could prove anything ,
but ... she still has it out for me .
what do you think she wants this time ?
whatever a pretty blonde who comes to the hamptons wants--
revenge .
i wouldn &apos;t put it past her .
i need you to find out what she &apos;s up to
so we can put a stop to it .
i &apos;m on it .
uh , any tips ?
gird your loins .
and speaking of-- has daniel come around
to accepting the fruit of his ?
i got him to spill the news of my pregnancy
to victoria last night .
what &apos;s next ?
well , we all know victoria has a difficult time
keeping secrets .
i have a few phone calls to make .
i had a feeling i &apos;d find you here .
charlotte , what are you doing here ?
you always run this trail when you &apos;re stressed .
what are you running from now ?
charlotte , come on .
talk to me , daniel .
everything was good with emily--
really good .
i mean , i had &quot; voulez . &quot; we were finally getting married .
i was happy . and then ...
sara .
the one girl who could throw me for a loop .
i mean , i love emily ,
but the way i feel when i &apos;m with sara
makes me question everything .
then maybe you should .
no , no , no . you don &apos;t understand , okay ?
you don &apos;t-- you don &apos;t get it .
danny , it &apos;s me--
if i hadn &apos;t run into sara at the bakery
everything would be fine . but ...
it &apos;s not . i &apos;m not .
look , i @-@ i gotta run , okay ?
i need to talk to you about something , man .
your talk with margaux didn &apos;t work .
even though you-- you threw her off the scent ,
she &apos;s--she &apos;s still digging into conrad .
is there way that you can ...
take control of her computer
and keep track of what she &apos;s writing ?
yes . but it &apos;s just a bit complicated .
i &apos;d need her , uh--
her i.p. address ?
i don &apos;t know whether to be impressed or terrified .
trust me , going behind margaux &apos;s back
is the last way i want to handle the situation ,
but i can &apos;t let her get any deeper .
then tell her the truth .
and become her biggest source ?
she &apos;s a journalist , nolan . she &apos;ll follow the story .
you don &apos;t know that for sure .
why don &apos;t you let her decide ?
can you help me or not ?
thanks again for coming to dr. rosen &apos;s with me .
of course .
oh , my god ! daniel , look !
how did the press find out we were here ?
emily ! emily ! emily !
this is impossible . we only told your mother .
i can &apos;t believe her . oh , my gosh .
just put-- just put the top up .
just go . just drive .
what the hell is wrong with you ? !
i told you we wanted to keep the pregnancy news quiet ,
and you leaked it anyway . and for what--
an @-@ another shot at emily ?
i did nothing of the sort .
and what makes you so certain that she wasn &apos;t behind it ?
come on . what possible reason could she have ?
to make certain that you marry her
and not leave for sara .
what ? what are you talking about ?
i know about your night in the pied a terre .
oh . well , i didn &apos;t sleep with her ,
if that &apos;s what you &apos;re insinuating .
not that it &apos;s any of your business .
no , it &apos;s emily &apos;s .
you told emily ?
you &apos;re damn right , i did .
you are marrying one girl ,
and you &apos;re in love with another , daniel .
no , you don &apos;t know a damn thing about who i love .
i think i do , and so does emily .
and that &apos;s why she trapped you into this pregnancy business .
you &apos;ve completely lost your mind , you know that ?
listen to me , she is a con artist .
she is-- she is going to be my wife ,
whether you like it or not ! you know why ?
because she is giving me the opportunity
to raise a child the right way--
in a loving home .
not with a loveless marriage .
oh , come on .
daniel , open your eyes !
stop !
she has deceived you from day one !
enough ! enough !
this time tomorrow , emily and i will be married .
you lost . okay ? it &apos;s over .
hello ?
jake ?
conrad grayson .
hope i &apos;m not too early .
you &apos;re right on time .
my god .
lydia ?
hello , conrad .
is it really you ?
almost as hard to believe as &quot; time &quot; magazine
wanting you for a cover .
you know , i always harbored a hope when victoria survived
that you &apos;d done the same .
really ?
you &apos;re the one that let me get on that plane .
i &apos;d be dead if it wasn &apos;s momentary lapse of evil .
well , then i &apos;ve never been more grateful for her
than i am at this moment .
and you look ...
like no time has passed .
i &apos;m not falling for this .
we were engaged , conrad ,
and you sent me to my death .
lydia , i did everything i could to stop you .
i mean , if memory serves , you conjured
a sick mother to get away from me .
but i take the blame for inspiring such a turn , but--
i find that hard to believe .
believe what you must .
you obviously thought i &apos;d be set against you
to use this ruse to get me here .
but believe me ,
honesty would have worked .
i think you should go .
why ?
oh , i can see you &apos;re not done with me yet .
trust me , conrad .
when i &apos;m done with you ,
you &apos;ll know it .
that should be all for today , ms. thorne .
or should i say mrs. greysons ?
not yet , don . let &apos;s see how tomorrow goes .
thanks .
hey , don &apos;t stress .
it &apos;s gonna be the best day of your life .
yeah , congratulations , ms. thorne .
is it true ?
hey .
are you really ...
pregnant ?
we wanted to tell you first , but ...
i don &apos;t care about that .
i &apos;m just so happy for you .
and i promise to be a much better aunt
than maid of honor .
what are you talking about ?
i just feel like i haven &apos;t been very helpful ,
to you or daniel .
but i want you to know that i have your back .
and if you &apos;ll let me , your hands and feet .
ladies ?
hi . hi , ms. thorne .
what is this ?
it &apos;s the day before your wedding .
you deserve to be pampered .
so you &apos;re getting a mani @-@ pedi .
thank you , charlotte . i love it .
hey , we &apos;re sisters . it &apos;s the least i can do .
margaux lemarchal speaking .
ms. lemarchal , this is the concierge desk
at the stella hotel .
i &apos;m terribly sorry to bother you ,
but ... a bottle of krug brut was ordered to your guest &apos;s room
by a visitor this afternoon .
a visitor ?
yes . yes , ma &apos;am .
would you prefer that charged to your room
or to mr. grayson &apos;s personal account ?
what the hell were you doing ?
i wanted him to pay , so i was trying to trap him .
and ?
i got nothing .
so you put my entire story at risk ?
and for what--a few dresses and a quick accouplement ?
he &apos;s not the man i remembered .
are you just playing me to reunite with an old flame ?
you &apos;re of no use to me if i can &apos;t trust you .
consider our arrangement terminated .
this stays with me .
oh , you don &apos;t have much left to cling to ,
do you , ms. davis ?
the time has come for victoria to pay
the ultimate price .
and i bring a gift to help you do just that .
ms. davis will no longer be a problem .
turns out she was selling her dirty grayson secrets
to our resident lois lane .
margaux .
but lydia couldn &apos;t help herself .
i caught her meeting with conrad .
old habits .
i alerted margaux to her shifting allegiance .
but once margaux &apos;s dispensed with her , it won &apos;t be long
until lydia &apos;s crawling back to conrad .
let her .
it will keep victoria distracted .
well , it seems that she &apos;s , uh , distracted enough ,
if you &apos;ve already got your fingers on that bracelet .
and i &apos;ll slip it back into victoria &apos;s closet
before she ever knows about it .
once it &apos;s covered in gunshot residue , of course .
yes , i &apos;m calling mr. harman please .
well , do you have a new contact number ?
what about a forwarding address ?
nothing . i see . merci .
i despise people interrupting me when i &apos;m working .
unless , of course , they have a good reason ,
and i &apos;ve got a doozy .
does this mean you &apos;ve reconsidered my proposal ?
you wish .
no , i stand steadfast by my statement .
you and everyone else .
perhaps , as we say in the states ,
you are barking up the wrong tree .
unlike the rest of you ,
i &apos;m not so easily dissuaded .
the truth is out there ,
and i won &apos;t stop until i find it .
do me one favor--
let me give you a lead .
i hope you haven &apos;t written the chapter on me yet .
you may have sweet @-@ talked your way past the help ,
but if you are here to exact more punishment ,
you &apos;ve clearly forgotten who i am .
seeing you , i &apos;ve remembered how much you mean to me .
and i &apos;ve come to my senses .
i realize i shouldn &apos;t have chosen victoria over you .
i &apos;ll never do that again .
it seems we &apos;ve both made mistakes .
then let &apos;s call it even .
shall we ?
you weren &apos;t lying when you said it was complicated .
i never lied to you .
but you didn &apos;t tell me that emily was pregnant .
i didn &apos;t know what to say .
well , now &apos;s your chance .
the moment i saw you in the bakery ...
all the feelings i once had came rushing back .
and i fell in love with you again .
sara , emily &apos;s having my baby .
we both know what a broken home
can do to a kid .
you know , i wish i could tell you that i don &apos;t understand ,
that you &apos;re making a mistake , but i can &apos;t .
i &apos;m sorry .
this is the way it is .
we &apos;re just not meant to be .
good @-@ bye , danny .
sara .
this family is so predictable .
when threatened ,
each grayson has their own retreat ,
like a turtle &apos;s shell--
dad and his den ,
you and this cupola .
daniel &apos;s running trail .
where &apos;s yours , charlotte ?
and please don &apos;t tell me it &apos;s that bar .
i &apos;m hoping it &apos;ll be my new apartment .
once this wedding madness is over ,
i &apos;m moving out of the stowaway .
it &apos;s time i lead my own life , mom ,
just like it &apos;s time for daniel to lead his .
what we did with sara
hurt them both ,
and daniel was better off without us interfering .
we don &apos;t know that .
i do .
i saw the pain he was in because of what we did .
i &apos;m done meddling ,
and it &apos;s time you stopped , too .
it &apos;s tradition for a warrior to have a drink of sake
before going into battle .
now close your eyes . focus .
when coming to the end of your journey ,
it &apos;s important to reflect on the start .
how you &apos;ve changed ,
what you &apos;ve lost ,
and what you &apos;ve gained .
when you and i first met ,
we had both lost so much
and faced immense pain .
but out of that pain came something beautiful ...
love .
a love that will always triumph over darkness .
a love that i would lay down my life for .
amanda clarke ...
will you marry me ?
yes .
our last name is gonna be &quot; ross &quot; ?
yeah . nolan insisted we be distant cousins
so that he can , you know , come and see us
without attracting any unwanted attention .
his heart is even bigger than his brain .
i &apos;m gonna miss him .
well , i &apos;ll remind you of that sentiment
when he &apos;s crashing on our sofa every other month .
who is it ?
it &apos;s daniel .
i should get going . it &apos;s getting late .
here .
it &apos;s just , you know ,
one more night ,
and then we &apos;ll never have to spend another apart .
one more night .
thank you .
there you are .
i &apos;ll take two of whatever you like
and a few minutes to talk .
this is a nice surprise .
what &apos;s up ?
i had an interesting conversation with nolan .
oh , yeah ?
what about ?
that there is more to conrad than you &apos;re letting on .
i don &apos;t know what nolan said , but , hey--
that was the extent of it , actually .
and that the story i &apos;m so desperate to tell
somehow involves you .
and if i care about you as much as he thinks i do ,
i should ask you about it .
so here i am .
don &apos;t be mad at nolan , jack .
he just wants what &apos;s best for you ,
as do i.
please . what is it ?
conrad grayson is responsible
for both the death of my wife and my brother .
what ?
and the secrets that you were looking to unearth
are the reasons why .
i can &apos;t believe that , jack . i &apos;ve known him all my life .
i &apos;ve never--
he &apos;s a bad man , margaux ,
and he &apos;s brought me a lot of pain .
well , you could &apos;ve told me that .
i know you .
you &apos;re a fighter .
i thought you &apos;d try to make him pay .
and since i &apos;ve lost everyone who &apos;s ever tried , i ...
i didn &apos;t want to lose you , too .
look , i don &apos;t want to tell you how to live your life .
but if you keep digging ,
you &apos;ll put yourself in danger .
it &apos;s more than that , jack .
telling that story would mean letting you go ,
and i &apos;m not willing to do that .
there &apos;ll be other stories ,
but there is only one jack porter .
well , this is it .
last chance to skip this silly tradition .
it &apos;s not silly . it &apos;s nice .
the next time you see me ,
i &apos;ll be walking the aisle in white .
what is it ?
i keep wondering why you &apos;re not bringing it up .
my mom said she told you about sara .
i didn &apos;t sleep with her .
okay ? i @-@ i was ...
confused and--and scared .
the last thing i wanted to do was to hurt you ,
and i am sorry .
say something , please .
is it over ?
yes .
yes . i ended it with her because you &apos;re the only one i want .
you &apos;re the only one i want , too .
i &apos;m all in .
with you ...
and the baby .
i &apos;m not going anywhere .
me neither .
what &apos;s all this ?
ah . this is our vast anthology of event photography .
i had them fetched from storage
to provide some inspiration for my memoirs .
and now that my muse has returned in the flesh ...
my cup runneth over .
would you mind if i ...
no . reminisce to your heart &apos;s content .
for tomorrow ,
we begin our future .
everything &apos;s in place .
daniel &apos;s on board .
lydia &apos;s preoccupied .
the evidence is ready .
i think we &apos;re all set .
and you &apos;re engaged to someone who knows the real you .
well done , cuz .
couldn &apos;t have done it without you .
i know .
well , i guess i &apos;m gonna have to get a new hobby .
what are your thoughts on spelunking ?
good night , nolan .
good evening , emily .
victoria .
to what do i owe this visit ?
another empty gift box ? perhaps one for the baby ?
oh , the time has run out for such frivolity .
your wedding is tomorrow , and the game is over .
i &apos;ve washed my hands of it .
instead , i &apos;ve found a place at the main table for nolan ross .
he &apos;s welcome to my spot .
i won &apos;t be in attendance .
congratulations , emily .
