&quot; the entrance to the dungeon is a moss covered door .
&quot; you manage to open it only to find yourself
&quot; face @-@ to @-@ face with a hideous , foul @-@ smelling ,
moss @-@ covered ogre . &quot;
what do you do ?
i say , &quot; hey , ma , what &apos;s for dinner ? &quot;
seventeen .
the ogre is amused by your joke and allows you to pass .
by the by , i liked it , too .
how go the wedding plans , howard ?
great . we spent five hours last night
at macy &apos;s registering for gifts .
looks like i &apos;m finally going to have
that darling little earthenware asparagus dish i &apos;ve always wanted .
see , this is the good thing
about having a girlfriend 9,000 miles away .
i can spend my nights doing whatever i want .
you mean like playing nerd games with us
and then taking a suspiciously long shower ?
maybe .
we enter the dungeon .
you see a dragon .
really ? so we &apos;re playing dungeons &amp; dragons
and we walk into a dungeon and see a dragon ?
isn &apos;t that a little on the nose ?
when you play chutes and ladders , do you complain
about all the chutes and all the ladders ?
are you gonna eat that whole pie ?
maybe . why not ?
who do i have in my life to watch my figure for ?
oh , god , did you watch bridget jones again ?
no , it &apos;s just that everybody &apos;s got someone .
sheldon &apos;s with amy , howard &apos;s getting married ,
you &apos;re dating my sister .
now that howard &apos;s getting married ,
maybe he &apos;ll inflate one of his old girlfriends for you .
you know who i blame for my loneliness ?
the united states of america .
your movies and your tv shows promised streets paved
with beautiful blonde women with big bazongas .
eat another pie , you &apos;ll have your own bazongas .
that &apos;s cruel .
you know it goes straight to my hips .
gentlemen , please focus .
you &apos;re facing a fire @-@ breathing dragon .
i don &apos;t know if i want to play anymore .
because you don &apos;t have a girlfriend ?
well , good lord ,
if that becomes a reason not to play dungeons &amp; dragons ,
this game &apos;s in serious trouble .
now , i assume we use this same wax later on
to neaten up each other &apos;s bikini regions .
yeah , my bikini region is fine .
who &apos;s shocked ? i &apos;m not .
so , bernadette , how &apos;s the wedding planning going ?
and i &apos;m not asking as a prospective bridesmaid .
pick me ! pick me !
we went cake @-@ tasting yesterday .
raj came along .
he cried and ate half the samples .
oh , the poor guy &apos;s so lonely .
we should set him up with someone .
you know , i met a really cute girl at work .
she &apos;s married to a guy in one of our drug trials .
well , hello ?
she &apos;s married .
yeah , but her husband is in
serious congestive heart failure ,
and a little birdie told me he &apos;s in the placebo group .
okay , so future grief @-@ stricken widow
is the one to beat .
are we ready to order ?
one moment .
i &apos;m conducting an experiment .
with dungeons &amp; dragons dice ?
yes . from here on in , i &apos;ve decided
to make all trivial decisions with a throw of the dice ,
thus freeing up my mind
do what it does best-- enlighten and amaze .
page 14 , item seven .
so , what &apos;s for dinner ?
a side of corn succotash .
hmm . interesting .
um , howard , can i see you for a minute , please ?
i don &apos;t want to show any more of your friends
how i can fit in the booster seats .
uh , no , that &apos;s not it . just come with me , please .
let &apos;s see what i &apos;ll be washing that succotash down with .
a pitcher of margaritas .
do you really want that ?
that &apos;s the great thing .
it doesn &apos;t matter .
my mind is freed up to think about more important things .
what &apos;s it thinking about now ?
hamburgers and lemonade .
um , raj , there &apos;s someone i want you to meet .
this is my friend emily . i know her from my spin class .
raj , relax . she can &apos;t hear you . she &apos;s deaf .
emily , this is our friend raj .
look at you guys just hitting it off .
i am so good .
hi .
she says , &quot; it &apos;s nice to meet you &quot; &quot;
does she really mean that
or was she signing it sarcastically ?
raj says it &apos;s nice to meet you , too .
she says she has to go back to her family ,
but penny has her number if you want
to text her and get together .
okay , i &apos;m going to play it cool .
tell her , &quot; maybe . whatever , babe . &quot;
he &apos;ll text you .
look at that . i have a date .
i love america again .
and now for dessert ...
come on , hot fudge sundae , come on , hot fudge sundae .
bam ! that &apos;s what i &apos;m talking about !
okay , as soon as she gets here ,
so she knows i &apos;m cool with it ,
i &apos;m going to make a joke about her being deaf .
i was thinking , &quot; hey , did you hear the one about ... ?
oh , no , i bet you didn &apos;t . &quot;
maybe we should revisit your lonely fat guy plan .
oh , she &apos;s here .
no joke .
she says she &apos;s sorry she &apos;s late .
tell her it doesn &apos;t matter .
tell her , her eyes shimmer like opalescent lilies
in the lake of the palace of the celestial maidens .
really ?
that &apos;s the first thing you want to say ?
i worked on it all night . use it .
look , i don &apos;t know the sign for opalescent .
then spell it .
i don &apos;t know how to spell it .
you &apos;re blowing this for me !
he likes your eyes .
you &apos;re making me sound like a caveman .
she says , &quot; thank you . you have nice eyes , too . &quot;
really ? ask her how many children she wants ,
and whatever number she says , say , &quot; me , too . &quot;
no .
fine . tell her i have a deep , sexy voice
like james earl jones .
she doesn &apos;t know what james earl jones sounds like .
great . then she won &apos;t know i &apos;m lying .
let &apos;s see , what else can i tell you about me
that would make you like me ?
ooh , i love music .
do you love music ?
you really want to ask her that ?
you &apos;re right . everyone loves music .
she says , &quot; do you play an instrument ? &quot;
no ,
but when i was six years old ,
i tried to start a boy band called
frankie goes to bollywood .
but i couldn &apos;t get any other boys to join ,
so my parents asked the servants
to be my backup dancers .
wait , when you sign &quot; servants , &quot;
don &apos;t sign it like i &apos;m bragging .
sign it in a way that i sound humble
with just a hint of &quot; that &apos;s right , i had servants . &quot;
do you hear yourself ?
yes , but she doesn &apos;t . so get signing , hand monkey .
i think i wrote a letter to santa claus every day .
and then on christmas morning ,
under the tree is a little puppy
with a red ribbon .
what are you doing ?
texting bernadette that i &apos;m gonna be late .
dude , what is she saying ?
it &apos;s a funny story about a puppy .
just smile and laugh .
quick , quick , stop smiling .
what ? why ?
the puppy died -- it choked on a doll head .
sad face , sad face !
it &apos;s a little hard to see with the city lights ,
but that w @-@ shaped constellation is cassiopeia .
and she was the mother of andromeda who &apos;s over there .
look , pretty stars .
this is her car .
she hopes she can see you again sometime .
good , good .
oh , boy ,
help me out here .
does she want me to kiss her or not ?
i speak sign language , i don &apos;t read minds .
if you were me , would you kiss her ?
yeah , but i &apos;m a make out king .
i was so smooth on that date .
you ? i made you smooth .
you were an idiot .
whatever , dude . she kissed me .
it might &apos;ve been on your lips ,
but it was my kiss .
oh , fine . let &apos;s agree she kissed both of us .
okay .
mustache is looking good there , sheldon .
don &apos;t thank me . thank the dice .
they told me what percentage of my face to shave .
why are you still doing this ?
because it &apos;s working .
in the past few weeks ,
unburdened by trivial decisions ,
i &apos;ve co @-@ authored two papers
in notable peer @-@ reviewed journals ,
and i &apos;m close to figuring out why
the large hadron collider has yet
to isolate the higgs boson particle .
you left out , got chafed testicles
because you no longer wear underpants .
the dice giveth and the dice taketh away .
is raj out with emily again ?
yeah , every night for the last month .
wow , can &apos;t believe he has a girlfriend .
me neither .
here &apos;s some other fun news on the raj / emily front .
he gave her a pair of diamond earrings and leased her a car .
you &apos;re kidding .
you think she &apos;s taking advantage of him ?
oh , of course not .
she wouldn &apos;t do something like that .
she &apos;s deaf .
handicapped people are nice , leonard .
everyone knows that .
yeah , i actually have information about raj
that would be helpful with this discussion .
could you tell us ?
let &apos;s see .
snake eyes . sorry , bud .
wait , hang on .
doubles . roll again .
okay , get this .
it doesn &apos;t matter if he &apos;s showering her with gifts ,
because the koothrappalis are vastly wealthy .
what do you mean &quot; vastly wealthy &quot; ?
well , &quot; wealthy &quot; means a lot of money .
&quot; vastly &quot; means even more .
i &apos;m not sure what &apos;s tripping you up .
look , i know they have money . i don &apos;t think it &apos;s that much .
no , you &apos;re wrong .
as you know , a few years ago , i achieved one of
my lesser dreams and became a notary public .
well , from time to time ,
i notarize banking documents for raj .
the koothrappalis aren &apos;t just rich , they &apos;re richie rich rich .
well , so how much is that ?
about halfway between bruce wayne and scrooge mcduck .
后者是 《 圣诞欢歌 》 主人公 超有钱也超小气
what the hell ?
the last time we went to the zoo ,
that son of a bitch made me buy him a churro .
listen , guys , i &apos;m sorry , i don &apos;t mean to be rude ,
but i need to go call raj &apos;s sister , who i love so much .
so vastly much .
okay , so he &apos;s got money , and it &apos;s a few gifts and a car .
and she got him to pay off all her credit cards .
what ? he paid off her credit cards ?
damn it , i could &apos;ve dated raj for a couple months .
but i @-@ i wouldn &apos;t have , because i &apos;m not that kind of girl .
we should really talk to raj .
he &apos;s not going to listen , he &apos;s in love .
can &apos;t figure out what to do ?
i remember those days .
now , if you &apos;ll excuse me , i have to ...
stay right here .
yeah , this is a bad idea .
we should go .
no .
i &apos;m the one that introduced him to her .
i &apos;ve got to say something .
you &apos;re engaged to my friend .
hey , bernadette doesn &apos;t mind where i get my motor running ,
as long as i park in the right garage .
i can &apos;t believe you &apos;re engaged to my friend .
oh , here she comes .
smart . whisper so the deaf chick can &apos;t hear you .
nice to see you .
um , can we talk to you about raj ?
she says , &quot; sure , what about him &quot; &quot;
okay , um , gosh , how do i start ?
um , see , raj is kind of naive .
i mean , he hasn &apos;t dated a whole lot of women .
and i &apos;m concerned that , without meaning to ,
you might be taking advantage of him .
you know , by letting him buy you a bunch of expensive things .
and i @-@ i ...
howard , focus .
tell her what i &apos;m saying .
right .
are you a gold digger or not ?
oh , uh , something , something ,
who the something do you think you are ?
mind your own something business
and go something yourself .
wait , i got this now .
i &apos;m so mad at you !
okay , wait ...
how dare you ambush my girlfriend at the gym !
we didn &apos;t mean for it to be an ambush .
just , it &apos;s kind of impossible not to sneak up on deaf people .
and hey , since when are you so chatty ?
i &apos;m hammered .
raj , come here .
this girl is trouble .
i mean , what kind of relationship is it
where you buy her gifts and she gives you sex ?
the best one i ever had !
okay , come on .
you know you can do better .
i see what &apos;s going on here .
you and i had our crazy night together ,
and now you can &apos;t stand to see me with another woman .
it &apos;s okay .
i can &apos;t get mad at your feelings .
i don &apos;t have feelings .
yeah , that &apos;s good .
keep telling yourself that .
he is cuter now that i know he &apos;s rich .
i have a surprise for you .
cover your eyes .
open them .
it &apos;s a real ruby .
it was a little expensive ,
but no one can put a price on love .
although , the people at cartier took a pretty good shot at it .
oh , mummy , daddy .
what a nice surprise .
no , it &apos;s not a nice surprise , it &apos;s a bad surprise .
penny called us .
penny ?
she told us you &apos;re spending all our money
on your new girlfriend .
i just got her a couple of things .
she gives me things , too .
yeah , yeah , i &apos;m a gynecologist .
i know exactly what she gives you .
you need to find a nice indian girl from a good family .
if you keep seeing this woman , you &apos;re cut off .
what ? you &apos;re going to make me choose between the woman i love
and the money i ... have very strong feelings for ?
it &apos;s up to you .
well , i choose love .
you &apos;re an idiot .
love doesn &apos;t last .
well , he &apos;s going to find out eventually .
think about it .
my parents are making me choose between money and you .
i choose you .
no , i think we &apos;ll have to return the car .
and that necklace , yeah , that , too .
but none of those things matter ,
because we have something better .
we have love .
oh , penny , i hurt so bad .
i know , i know .
sometimes i put the tv on mute
just to pretend she &apos;s still with me .
but i can &apos;t watch the closed captioning without crying .
oh , i &apos;m so sorry .
i wish i could make you feel better .
seriously ?
i &apos;m heartbroken and you &apos;re hitting on me ?
what ? ! no !
look , penny , you &apos;re great ,
but i had a long talk with my parents ,
and they said if i date an indian girl ,
i get a maserati .
oh , cheesecake ,
you &apos;re just as good as a woman ,
even though i can &apos;t have sex with you .
try throwing it in the microwave for a few seconds .
should i use the rest room or wait until we get home ?
come on , papa needs to void his bladder .
oh , that &apos;s not what you want to see after three buttermilks .
here you go , boys .
i &apos;ll pick it up when you &apos;re ready .
thanks for dinner , buddy .
yeah , real big of you .
hurry , hurry , hurry .
oh , and don &apos;t cheap out on the tip .
