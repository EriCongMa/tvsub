第一季 第十六集
Gossip girl here. Into the scandalous lives of manhattan's elite.
What's the one thing that no one in our group has,not even Blair?
A boy friend
I met this nice guy and supposed to meet him in park for lunch tomorrow.
Grounded or not grounded,You're not old enough to date.
Name's Asher,and I do go to unity.
He's been staying at the ostroff center.
It's depression?
Is it bad?
Bad enough to try to kill himself.
Oh,my god,Georgina.
What are you doing here?
well,I told you I was coming.
Didn't you get my gifts?
What's Georgina got on you?
Dan I understand,but what's so bad you can't even tell me?
So... tell me about Dan.
Dan of all people cannot know Georgie.
Um. I'm Sarah,by the way.
I'm Dan. nice to meet you,Sarah.
And who am i?
That's a secret I'll never tell.
Spotted...Jenny Jenny Humphrey Wading in the met fountain,
Fishing for change...
Blair Waldorf,seen dallying with an off-duty doorman
At the blarney stone on a monday night.
It looks like the battle
Between the queen b. and little j.
Has moved from the streets to the blogs.
Who's sending this debasing dish?
I have a feeling...
A nice,shiny dime to add to your collection.
Why the fruit cup,b.? lost your taste for yogurt?
So what are we doing tonight?
Asher's parents are in cannes,
So he and Jenny are throwing a party at his house.
It's a really small get-together with just our closest friends.
Sorry,Blair.
Blair can take my place. invitations are nontransferable.
She's new to the group.
Just because your name's on the invite
Doesn't make you a hostess.
Oh! then why is the party planner calling me?
Excuse me,girls.
Hey,dad?
I'm kinda busy. what's up?
I was just wondering what time you want me to serve
Your favorite home-cooked meal tonight. maybe around 8:00?
Oh,um,i have that choir thing.
Remember,i talked to you about it,
And you said I could go cause I've been good? oh,right.
Well,maybe we could wait to eat till after you got home then.
You're gonna be hungry after all that singing. yeah,well,i mean,
They have food there,and it's probably gonna go pretty late.
So,um... tomorrow? okay,love you.
Love you,too.
Sorry. floral emergency.
Oh,and you will be happy to know
That the entire unity lacrosse team r.s.v.p.'d!
Hi! oh,my god. it's Asher.
Let's go say hi.
How did little Jenny Humphrey become the next Brooke Astor?
The same way they all do. marry up.
Hey,why the long face?
Are you still sad mom wouldn't let you go
To monte carlo for the bachelor party? no,i'm fine.
I figured I'd let Bart,Chuck and prince Albert
Have their fun... oh,that didn't come out like I meant it.
Um... gossip girl. looks like jenny's been spotted at gap
Sewing stella mccartney labels into pocket ts.
These rumors are getting to be ridiculous.
Oh,like the one where I'm gossip girl. hey,it made sense at the time.
It never made any sense.
Yeah,it did! it did! yeah,it did. no,it didn't.
Wait,hold on. it's Chuck. I have something to do before school starts,
But tell him I say hi. okay. don't forget about dinner tonight.
Yeah. salut,Chuck.
Yes,i'm still fine.
I haven't heard from Georgina in two weeks.
So if you'd stop calling me,
I'd finally be rid of all of my monsters. bye.
You can read about it all day long,
But you have to walk the city to know it.
Okay,but look,
Anything is better than getting lost on the train every day. subway.
Click those heels all you want. you're not in portland anymore.
Seriously,you and dan are so sweet to adopt me.
I-i'd be a mess without you guys.
Well,more of a mess than I already am.
Red eye to go? yes,please. thank you. hey,Sarah.
Sorry for talking your ear off the other night,guys. he tends to ramble,
As you'll get to know.
Yeah.
Well,i'm a good listener,as he'll get to know.
Are there any new developments?
Uh,no. no,more of the same.
Jenny and her boyfriend are still inseparable,
And she's even more insufferable.
Give her a break. Asher's her first love.
It's infatuation. it's not love. yeah,but to a 15-year-old girl,
I mean,there really isn't a difference.
And how long did it take you,dan? um... that's a little different,
Vanessa.
It took me-- uh,one glance at a ninth grade birthday party?
Yes,but two years to obsess over it. so things are better with...
Serena? Serena. yeah. yeah,good memory.
Right. things are finally back to normal.
Good. well,i mean...
You know,it's--it's tough making friends in a new city.
It'd be really nice to meet her. yeah,Serena would love you.
She loves everybody. not that she would only like you
Because she doesn't discriminate. um... ahem.
See what she meant about that rambling thing?
How's tonight?
Tonight would be perfect.
Good. see you.
Be right back.
Okay.
Oh,my god!
He's so cute!
Hey,can I talk to you for a minute?
Sure. is something wrong?
That's what I was gonna ask you. where have you been lately?
You haven't returned any of my calls. sorry.
It's been harder than I thought to keep up with schoolwork
And the new spring social calendar
And my new boyfriend. yeah. Asher,right?
Yeah. he's cute and smart and basically perfect,
And the best part is I think he really likes me. well,
Then he has good taste.
But... how well do you actually know him?
Oh,that's so sweet. you're being protective. no,i'm not.
But... yes. yes,i am. I've got nothing against him. I just...
Something about him
Makes me feel maybe he's not the right guy for you.
Oh,my god. wait. do you have a crush on me or something? no,i don't.
I just want you--
Don't be embarrassed. it's cute.
I mean,and not so unexpected,actually. I'm flattered.
It's just... my heart belongs to Asher.
I actually gotta go,but,um,text me,'kay?
Oh. bye.
Hey,are you okay? yeah.
What? you're here!
Mmm! and you're late.
Mm,i know. I come bearing apologies and an invitation.
What are you up to tonight? I know what I'm not up to-- having fun.
The s.a.t. tutor was over for four hours last night.
Mm. so this tutor,is he--is he cute?
Mm,well,if hair in the ears is your thing...
I hate that since I'm not gonna
Use the score Chuck bought for me,
I have to study every night.
I can't even be distracted by that--
I see your point. so then how about,um,
Dinner tonight with Sarah instead?
Oh,Sarah again?
What is she,your new girlfriend or something? yeah. just kidding.
But she's new in town,and she does want to meet you.
Well,since Bart and Chuck are out of town,
I already agreed to a quiet family dinner in our old suite.
I'm sorry. what about tomorrow? no,my--my sister and tongue.
The two things that don't go together so well. oh! lighten up.
You have been down on him since the beginning.
Give him a chance and then judge.
Maybe he'll surprise you,like I did.
How are you always so right? it's easy whenyou'realways wrong.
Hey,you got first period free.
Why don't you go get to know him? go! okay. okay. all right,okay.
And the only thing
More shocking than the truth...
Are the lies people tell
To cover it up.
When you revise the seating chart,
Don't forget to place mr. Spitzer
As far away from Serena's table
As possible.
Thank you.
Ugh. what is not on the schedule today?
I don't think I am.
Maybe you could fit me in between
Preston bailey and Sylvia Weinstock?
Well,good luck fitting anything between those two.
What--what are you doing here? well,believe it or not,
I'm here to see you.
Well,i have a laundry list of things to do today. it's about Jenny.
AlIson's away on an artIsts' retreat,
And I could really use a mother's advice.
I think I might be in over my head.
I suppose we could talk about it on the way.
What's going on? see you later.
Hey,Asher. how's it going? you got a minute?
Yeah. uh,but just a minute. Jenny and I have a lunch date.
Well,look,there's no easy way to say this,honestly,
So I'm just gonna-- I'm just gonna say it.
I-i,uh,saw you this morning.
Saw me what? I saw you... you know,i saw you kissing that guy.
You got the wrong person. come on,man. i-i-i don't think I do.
Are you calling me queer? that's... not at all what I said.
You wanna know how queer I am?
I'm so queer,
I'm gonna pop your sister's cherry tonight.
Hey! what'd you say?!
What are you doing? stop it! Jenny,i need to talk to you in private.
Well,anything you have to say to me,
You can say in front of my boyfriend. re--okay. all right,fine.
Your boyfriend is not being honest with you. I wasn't gonna tell you yet,
But i...
Wanted to invite you to the country house this weekend.
Your brother thought we were moving too fast and got upset.
Dan,can't you just let me be happy for once?
Jenny,i want you to be happy. just not with a guy who--
Yeah,i understand that you're threatened by him,
Because clearly he's everything you wanna be.
He's good-looking and worldly,a legacy at dartmouth.
But even you should know
That jealousy clashes with l.l.bean pants.
It's a snub from one party,b.
Plus what's the big deal anyway? you don't even like Asher.
I didn't like last season's
Louis vuitton patchwork bag either,but that doesn't mean
I want to see it all over town on Jenny Humphrey's arm. touch?
What do you say we have a girls' night out tonight? oh,i'm sorry.
I can't. I have dinner with the family.
Let me remind you of a little promise you made.
"don't go to france. I'll be there for you."
I'm really sorry I've been distant,
But things will be better soon,i promise. obviously starting tomorrow.
What's wrong? you look stressed,even for you.
I'm still worried about Jenny.
You mean because she's self-obsessed,
Self-serving,self-centered,self--
No. no,i wish it was about her and herself,
But it's more about who she's with.
I can't get through to her.
I tried,and she just completely blew me off,
And she dissed my pants.
Maybe I underestimated her.
She's just going through a phase. we all went through it.
And apparently,some of us still are in it.
All that matters to someone like Jenny right now
Are the four g's--guys,girlfriends and gossip girl.
It's true. don't feel bad.
Unless it's coming from one of them,
She's not gonna hear it.
Here we go.
Ah,thank you.
I tell her she can't see Asher. she calls him.
I take away her phone. they're on ichat.
How do you keep them from growing up
When they can have a full relationship
From the confines of their own bedrooms? well,the answer is you can't.
She's gonna grow up no matter what. I read her e-mail.
Well,you can't be too concerned about their privacy
When their well-being is at stake,
Especially if you think they're lying to you. was she? right to my face.
I know Serena went through a similar phase.
Well,if Serena's indiscretions were as p.g. as Jenny's,
I wouldn't have needed the botox.
Dan was so much easier.
Well,raising girls is different.
Serena would be a horrible monster for a hundred days,
And then on the 101st,
She'd be my little girl again.
So I just wait and hope,huh?
Well,that's the hardest part.
You have to trust that you've done your job.
She'll come back to you.
That's...
It's perfect.
Beautiful. it's my finest piece. mm-hmm.
Here.
Let me.
Mark ingram,it's beautiful.
You've outdone yourself. oh,wow.
Oh,wow.
This just in--
Asher Hornsby spotted locking lips before class...
But not with his girlfriend.
Looks like gentlemen don't prefer blondes,little j.
They prefer other gentlemen.
Now you know how Vanessa Hudgens feels.
Is this just another round of blanks
Fired between b. and little j.?
I'm tired of being the bearer of bad grudges.
This is the last item that goes to press without proof.
I'm so glad gossip girl finally got her balls back.
Yeah,she was totally turning into the new "page six."
Low blow. wasn't me. wish it was.
Hello? miss Van DerWoodsen?
It's Luke from the concierge's desk.
You asked that we call first
Before delivering anything upstairs? is there something for me?
Yes,a package from a miss Georgina Sparks.
Hello? did I lose you?
Uh,no. uh,just keep it there.
I'll pick it up right after school.
And don't let it out of your sight.
Of course. thank you.
What was that about? nothing. it's just this...
Nothing. I'll see you later,okay? bye.
Bye. hey...
Hey,b.
Dan humphrey--just who I hate to admit I was looking for.
You're dirty.
Wha--uh,what are you talking about?
Cheating,drinking,drugs-- it's all fair game.
But outing your sister's boyfriend is dark.
How did squeaky-clean Humphrey even come up with that?
I didn't come up with anything. oh,my god.
You know something. spill it.
Yeah,i-i might have seen Asher kissing another guy.
So it's true? who was he kissing?
I don't know. I don't-- I don't know. I couldn't see.
But what does that even matter? right now gossip girl's credibility is
The same as Tinsely Mortimer's after a few martinis.
But if I can prove that his duplicity
Is more than just a rumor,then they'll break up.
That's what you want,isn't it? well,yeah,i guess. yeah--
Asher's just using your sister as a cover.
It's your brotherly duty to save her from becoming
The next Katie holmes. and you're in this to help Jenny?
Motive is irrelevant as long as our endgame is the same. no,Blair,
This is not a game to me,okay? I don't want her to get hurt. well,
You should've thought that through
Before you told all of manhattan that Jenny's a glorified hag.
You know what? i--you're on your own.
I'm done.
Suit yourself.
Lly,Rufus. what were you thinking?
You threw her a surprise birthday party
And had her face painted on a cake with a tiara?
It seemed like a good idea at the time.
Yeah,well,so did flannel and acid-washed jeans,
But they weren't flattering either.
What is it?
Is it too much?
Uh,is it not enough?
It's not the dress. it's you in it.
I'm sorry. I thought...
I didn't mean...
We're here as friends,right?
No,we are friends.
It's just how you look.
Nothing new on "gossip girl" for three hours.
Guess she wasn't kidding about her new standards. hey,Jenny!
Oh! sorry,i can't chat,
But have so much fun at your party tonight.
She's totally running to a booty call with your brother.
I cannot believe you just went there. and where have you gone,little j.?
Yeah,you and Asher. how far? far enough.
Playing coy only means one thing. maybe Asher doesn't like girls.
Is that why we went to third? you went to third?
No,he did.
Well done. make him work for it.
Whoever said that money doesn't buy happiness
Didn't know where to shop.
Lucky for me,i may have to go out tonight after all.
Did you get it? lucky for you,is knows five ways to sneak into
The unity boys' locker room,and six to sneak out.
Asher takes an abnormally long shower after practice.
Maybe his lacrosse stick
Isn't the only thing he likes to play with.
Why'd you want his phone so badly anyway? it was once said
That a person's eyes are the windows to their soul.
That was before people had cell phones.
This is a surprise.
Party's not for a couple hours.
Yeah,well,a lot can happen in a couple hours.
Uh,Jenny.
What are you doing? what's wrong?
It--nothing's wrong.
This... it just isn't what we do.
Are you suddenly...
Not happy? i...
I'm holding up my end of the bargain.
What bargain?
You're jenny humphrey from brooklyn.
You need status,access,resources.
I give that to you. what do I give you?
Do we really need to talk about this?
Yeah. yeah,yeah,we do.
So what was on "gossip girl's" true?
Do you really think someone like me
Would just date someone like you?
But you've been so nice.
And I'll keep being nice. nothing has to change,okay?
Asher...
Come on,jenny.
Tonight you're hosting
Your first upper east side party.
That's something that blair and those girls
Can never take away from you.
I know. thank you.
You're welcome. and...
There is something you can do to show your thanks.
I think it would be better for both of us
If we put those rumors to rest once and for all.
What do you want me to do?
If you put the camera here,
She'll never know. are you sure she's gonna be down for this?
It's serena. she goes down for anything.
So how's the new mr. and mrs. shepherd?
I just did something so stupid.
It's hot. I'm too hot.
You're hot.
Where do you think you're going?
I can't talk right now,mom. I'll explain later.
If you invite an old friend to our quiet family dinner,
I expect you to stay and eat.
You know how I always loved when georgina came around.
I ran into lily in the lobby.
You totally forgot to tell her I was coming over for dinner.
Did you get my present?
Breaking news--
Asher Hornsby overheard bragging
That little j. swiped her "v" card at his register.
Jenny,is this true?
It's private.
It's on the internet. yeah,well,it's none of your business.
And since when
Did you start reading "gossip girl" blasts anyway?
Since you became the subject of them.
You're 15 years old,and I'm your big brother.
It is my business. well,it's not true.
You happy? oh. w--
You can't tell anyone,though. everyone has to believe it.
W--are--are you saying
That you actually want your friends to think
That you're sleeping with a guy who's gay?
Do you believe everything that you read on "gossip girl"?
I didn't read it. I saw it.
So you were the one who sent the tip? yeah,i'm--look,i'm sorry,
But I tried to tell you. you wouldn't listen to me.
I needed to get your attention somehow.
Well,i knew about him the whole time.
So... so you let him use you?
Well,maybe I was using him. did you ever think of that?
For once in your life,
Could you just stop judging everyone? no,i'm not. I'm--
You think that you're so different and so good?
Well,guess what,dan?
The minute that you start sending tips to gossip girl,
You're in the game with the rest of us.
B.,now's not a good time.
It's important. look,i know I told you I'd be more available,
But I just can't right now. but it can't wait.
Sorry. it was just blair.
Oh. how is snow white?
Uh,snow not so white. did you hear that she and-- eric.
So,georgina,what brings you back to new york?
Oh,i just had some time to kill.
She went to boarding school in switzerland.
Oh,your parents must be happy you're back. oh,no.
Actually,they've moved to the country full-time.
I'm just in the city to catch up with some old friends.
What about you?
You and that gorgeous tiffany rock
Seem to be the talk of the city. thank you.
Mr. bass and I are very,um,happy.
You look it. you all do.
I mean,there must be love in the new york air.
You're engaged,serena's found a new guy,
Eric found himself a boyfriend.
Excuse me?
Oh,i-i'm sorry. I don't think I heard you right.
What? you haven't met serena's new guy? a boyfriend?
Oh. you mean eric.
You didn't know he was dating someone?
I... didn't think it was a secret.
I mean,i saw them kissing in front of st. jude's this morning
For all the world to see.
Well,don't look so embarrassed,e.
He is a hot piece! well done.
Please,georgina. it's not funny,okay?
You--you didn't know eric was dating a boy.
This doesn't make any sense,because that would mean...
That eric is...
And he's not.
He's just not.
Are you?
Oh,god.
Eric.
Great,mom. that's just great.
How dare you?
Dan went out with vanessa,and I'm going to choir practice
Like we talked about. don't wait up. not so fast.
Where were you gonna change your clothes?
We don't wear a uniform for rehearsal.
Well,unless the choir is entertainment at asher's party,
You have some explaining to do.
How'd you know about the party?
I know a lot more than you think I do.
Nice dress.
I wanted one night out,okay? what was I supposed to do?
Ask my permission.
Well,you would've said no. you're probably right,
But that's no excuse to lie to me. dad,you don't understand,all right?
I'm throwing this party! not anymore you're not.
You need to call asher and tell him you're not coming. I can't.
It's too late,all right?
All my friends-- you heard me.
I promised. all that good behavior from the past few weeks
Just got wiped out from that lie. you can't stop me,all right? I'm going.
Jenny,if you walk out that door,i--
You'll what?! what,dad? what are you gonna do?
Are you gonna put bars on my window
Or chain me to the kitchen counter?
I'm not your...
I'm not a little girl anymore.
You can't make me do anything.
You've already lost my trust.
You really wanna lose my respect,too?
I'm sorry.
Yeah. okay.
Hey,it's me.
Bye.
Who are you talking to?
Chuck.
What,you called chuck?
Yeah. I've been talking to him a lot lately.
Guy's got his faults,but he's never judged me.
I'm your sister.
We're us.
You can tell me anything.
I wanted to,
But it... it's--it's not the type of thing
You blurt out on the way to school.
I was waiting for the right time.
Dinner with georgina definitely wasn't at all.
I'sorry about her...
About me.
I came back for you,
And then I abandoned you all over again.
This isn't like before.
I'm fine,really.
Well,i'm here now.
When I was at ostroff,i met this guy.
We were going through a lot of the same stuff,
And now that guy is dating jenny.
Wait,you're the mystery guy that asher was spotted kissing?
I know this isn't how you wanted this to happen.
Yeah,i guess the important thing
Is that it's happening.
I'm so proud of you.
I love you,no matter...
What you do,who you like,
Whose boyfriend kisses you.
The people who care about you
Will always stand by your side,okay? yeah.
I think I'm gonna drop by asher's party.
There's one more person I have to talk to.
Oh,my god. blair crashed jenny's party.
You look... I know.
Jenny's gonna freak. watch and learn,ladies.
The most important parties to attend
Are the ones you're not invited to.
Where's the host? I have something for him.
Oh,thank god you're here. I'm so happy to see you. hey.
I'm happy to see you,too. you can meet sarah. oh,i'd love to,
But now is really not a good time.
Well,she's here,so,uh... sarah,serena. serena,sarah.
Hi. I'm sarah.
It is so nice to finally meet you.
Dan told me you were pretty,but he didn't do you justice.
Dan,can we talk in private,please? hey,no,no,no. wait.
To show me one of her movies.
I'm a filmmaker,too,of sorts.
Actually,i brought one of my short films.
I was hoping to get your opinion.
Maybe you wanna see it,too,and tell me what you think?
I'll go get my laptop.
Dan,would you get me a coffee? please?
Yeah.
What the hell are you doing,georgina? put that away.
Aw,come on. I'm just having a little fun.
Remember? like old times.
You and me pretending to be different people--
Svetlana and savannah. this is not a game.
I don't know how you even filmed that,
But I'm not playing with you this time. it's just a friendly game.
But we're not friends.
Oh... I think we are.
You see,because with me as your enemy,
Dan sees this.
And if the heavy petting doesn't send him running,
Well,i'll bet what happened after will. hey.
What'd we miss? nothing.
It's like sarah and I have known each other for years.
Oh. great.
We don't need the laptop anymore. thanks.
No,i got a little shy about showing it.
Maybe next time?
Okay.
So was it as special as you hoped it would be?
Cause yours totally wasn't. and yours was?
Ladies,your drinks.
I mean,yeah.
Asher made me feel really safe. you are so lucky.
Mmm,i know.
You guys,blair is here. what is she doing here? she wasn't invited.
We need to talk.
Give us a moment,guys.
I thought you might want this back.
Whatever you found,it's not what it looks like.
It's always what it looks like.
And judging by the texts and photos,
It looks like a little more than friendship.
What are you gonna do with them?
Well,lucky for you,
Your friend is someone I actually care about,
Or I would've used them against you and jenny already.
Too bad you don't care about him the same way.
It's okay,blair. I can handle this.
What's he doing here? what is she doing here?
Are you gonna tell her,or am i? there's nothing to tell.
Gossip girl was right.
Asher was kissing someone this morning... me. oh!
He's totally lying. tell him,jenny.
I was with you all morning.
Yeah. asher's right.
I was with him. eric's lying.
Why would I stand here,in front of everyone we know,
And tell them if it wasn't true?
I'm gay...
And so are you.
Get this faggot out of here!
Go ahead and do it.
What did you just do?
You'll see.
What kind of mother does not know that her son is gay?
The people you know best
Are the ones most capable of surprising you.
The things that I said,the way I acted...
It was not my finest maternal moment.
What if he does something again?
I know how much you love him. so does he.
You just need to remind him of that.
But what if it's not enough? most of the time,it's all we've got.
And what about you? what are you gonna do?
I'm gonna wait for my daughter to come to me,
And then I'm gonna ground her until she's 25.
Ah,we make quite the team,huh?
Always did.
Good luck,lil,
With everything.
I'm sure you'll make a beautiful bride.
Mm,thank you.
Good night,rufus.
Weekend update--
A same-sex kiss hasn't caused this much controversy
Since britney and madonna.
Looks like little j. didn't spread her legs after all.
She spread lies instead.
Asher is gay,
And I have the correspondence to prove it.
Looks like someone needs a semester in france.
Get your things,girls. we're leaving.
Guys,we can still have fun. don't leave.
It's kind of hard to party after the gay bomb drops.
I'm gonna do something out of character
And give you the benefit of the doubt.
Tells us gossip girl is wrong.
Did you or did you not sleep with asher?
I... may have exaggerated a little bit.
Dating a gay guy is an honest mistake,
But lying to your girlfriends about sex is unforgivable.
To think,
I almost asked you to wear a matching dress tonight.
You're branded now with the "l" word.
"liar."
So what are we doing tonight?
We are doing nothing.
I,however,am going home.
But,um...
Tomorrow,dinner at the waverly
And then to 151 for drinks. yeah.
I'll have dorota blackberry everyone an itinerary.
Don't look so sad,little j.
The sun will come out tomorrow...
Even though your boyfriend did today.
Hey,um,i made...
Uh,some tea.
Um,it's probably iced now,but,um...
Look,my reaction earlier-- it's okay,mom.
No,it's not okay.
You just caught me off guard. I guess i...
I just wasn't ready.
Well,i wasn't ready either,so...
It's okay if you need time.
Since you're being so honest,
I'm gonna,um,to try as well,okay?
I'm scared.
And life is tough enough as it is,you know?
I want... I want the best for you.
I'm worried for your safety and your happiness.
I have a better chance of being happy if I'm honest.
I know that,
And I want you to know what love is...
Whoever you're with,
Because it's pretty great.
You would know,right?
Fourth time's the charm.
Ah,yes,
The truth always comes out.
It's one of the fundamental rules of time.
And when it comes out,it can set you free...
Or end everything you fought so hard for.
My,my. if it isn't little j.,risen from the ashes.
I came to tell you in person...
You win.
Oh,sweetie. we just started to play.
No,you don't understand.
I'm done...
With you,with them,
With all of it.
Just like that,you wave the white flag?
I lied,and I stole,
And I lost the respect of my family... for what?
So I can be like you?
You asked me before if it was all worth it.
My answer is,it's not.
I tried to warn you...
There's a price to pay.
I always knew a girl like you couldn't afford it.
Well,you were right.
Well,you put up a good fight...
For a freshman.
Thanks.
I hope you don't expect a hug.
I don't expect anything anymore.
So... she's great,right? what do you think?
Honestly,there's something I don't really like about her.
Okay,but you had your doubts about vanessa in the beginning,
And now you guys are friends. this is different.
I-i don't understand why you--you're...
Why I'm what?
Jealous. there's no reason to be.
She--she actually wanted us to patch things up.
What,you told her about our problems?
Yes,because she wanted to listen to them,
And she had good advice,too. look at me. I love you,okay?
You just have to take my word for it.
Do not trust her.
But you just met her. i...
You know,you've been hanging out with chuck
And you've been partying and avoiding me and lying,
And y-you're trying to tell me who I can and cannot trust?
I-i don't understand that at all.
We--we all live in brooklyn,so...
I don't know.
If--if you need to catch a cab,i think you should do that here.
Dan,don't. I want to talk.
Then talk.
I'm gonna get going.
Hey,just hold on. one--one second.
I forgot something inside. I'll catch up with you guys?
Okay.
Well,i had fun.
How about you? what do you want from me?
I want things to go back to how they were before that night,
Before things got so screwed up.
We were such good friends,and now we can be again.
Why would I want to be friends with somebody who blackmails me,
Who outs my little brother at the dinner table?
Eric was an honest mistake. I would never hurt him.
No,i don't believe you.
I don't believe you about eric,about anything.
Maybe you're right.
Maybe I did it on purpose.
Because I can,
Because I know things
About you,about your family,
About your boyfriend,
And I know them before you do.
Oh,look. cab.
You get home safe.
Hold up,guys! I'm coming.
Another way the truth comes out
When you don't even mean it to...
"angry,"
"change,"
"trust,"
"girl."
Somethin' you wanna talk about?
Who would have thought scrabble could be so therapeutic?
That last one was a triple word score.
Or when,
Without saying a word,
It's still loud and clear.
Dad?
Do you think it'd be okay if I joined you?
You know there's always room for you here.
Yeah,and dad's totally losing,so he could use your help.
Dad,i'm sorry.
Oh. I'm sorry about everything.
But the worst thing the truth can do
Is when you finally tell it,
It doesn't set you free,but locks you away forever.
Blair?
Serena,what are you doing here? it's late.
Oh,my god.
What happened? what's wrong?
Talk to me. I can't.
Of course you can.
No. no,b.,this is the one thing I can't tell you.
I can't tell anyone.
I-i'm not anyone. I'm me. you can tell me anything.
No,i can't...
Because then that'd make you a part of it,
And you can't be a part of this.
What are you talking about? you're starting to scare me.
Hey,hey,hey. we're sisters.
You're my family. what is you,is me.
There's nothing that you could ever say to make me let go.
I love you.
What is it?
I killed someone.
