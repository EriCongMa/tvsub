第七季 第三集
howard ?
hi .
uh , love your coasters .
big fan of lincoln .
it &apos;s george bernard shaw .
big anti @-@ semite .
what are you doing here , howard ?
need a lawyer .
oh , my god , i was such a cow .
oh , well , don &apos;t worry , dear .
most babies are unattractive .
oh , jackie .
grandma &apos;s helping me pick out family photos
for dad &apos;s campaign ad .
oh , you look so stern in these pictures , alicia .
uh , there &apos;s a mr. lyman in the living room .
he said he knew you .
and lucca quinn called .
she said they need you in bond court in an hour .
okay , thanks .
why do you need a lawyer , howard ?
they &apos;re pushing me out .
cary , that little gerbil ,
told me to take emeritus status .
can you imagine that ? me ? huh ?
my billings are up double digits .
well , not you ; your associates .
i &apos;m a partner , i &apos;m adding va ...
whose side are you on , anyway ?
my guess is , they &apos;re pushing you out because of performance .
you don &apos;t do anything , howard .
look ...
you know why i &apos;m here .
you want to get back at lockhart / agos for firing you ;
i want to bring an ageism suit .
we can help each other out .
howard ...
let me give you some advice .
we on the meter ?
no , this is free .
you can &apos;t bring an ageism suit if you quit .
you have to be fired .
and you can &apos;t let them fire you for cause .
so what do i do ?
work harder .
bring more money to the firm ,
and they won &apos;t have a rationale to fire you .
lay the groundwork .
keep a journal of every incident of ageism you encounter .
with details-- who said or did what .
and don &apos;t give them cause to fire you .
i have to go to bond court .
madame .
did you used to sing ?
excuse me ?
sing .
you look like someone i used to know at the civic opera house .
uh , no .
you do have the face of an opera singer .
you are a flirt .
my best quality .
just a second .
hello . who is this , please ?
it &apos;s eli . why are you talking like that ?
uh , talking like what , mr. gold ?
like you &apos;re ... nothing .
where are you , jackie ?
i need these photos right now .
i &apos;m coming directly , mr. gold .
eli , we started .
started ? it &apos;s 10 : 20 .
yeah .
the meeting was at 10 : 00 .
yes , oddly i was told the meeting began at 10 : 30 .
hillary uses iowa to shore up her base ,
and we use it to stake out ground to her right .
hillary will run the table ,
and we &apos;ll be the only vice presidential option
who can pull in the middle . which is why our theme of the week
needs a center @-@ right tilt .
&quot; family first . &quot;
show the florricks as a family who had their troubles
but stuck together , came out stronger .
we &apos;ll be talking to the iowa commission on family ,
catholic charities ...
and of course we &apos;ll need alicia to play ball .
oh , ruth , i already gave you mrs. florrick &apos;s schedule .
right , six days over the next two months .
carl , we &apos;ll talk about this later .
uh , i just want to know ,
why is she controlling the governor &apos;s agenda ?
why are we dancing to her tune ?
no one is dancing to anyone &apos;s tune .
alicia has a job , she has responsibilities .
right , responsibilities ,
like defending murderers and deadbeat dads .
carl , that &apos;s enough .
i &apos;m sure eli &apos;s already talked to alicia about all this .
have you , eli ?
have i talked to her about defending murderers
or how many days she &apos;s giving the campaign ?
how many days ...
i want to hear from ruth .
i &apos;m sure she can talk for herself .
we need more days , eli .
twice as many .
i want you to stay here , eli .
run alicia &apos;s rehabilitation from right here .
from where ? you have my office .
your new office .
oh , yeah , just a sec .
how nice .
a little tight ; we &apos;re looking for something bigger .
but i know it &apos;s all about the work for you .
you can &apos;t harass me out of my job .
now , why would i want to do that ?
it &apos;ll be much more fun watching you come
into the office every day .
oh , and we need mrs. florrick
to appear on mama &apos;s homespun cooking .
i &apos;m sorry , what ?
mama &apos;s homespun cooking .
it &apos;s a cooking show .
daughters learn recipes from their moms .
you want alicia and veronica to do a cooking show ?
yeah , &quot; family first , &quot; &quot; traditional values . &quot;
generational post @-@ feminist respect .
hillary with the chocolate chip cookies .
yes , yes .
hillary with the chocolate chip cookies .
and what if i said alicia and veronica would never do that ?
then i would ask you to be a professional and convince them .
sure .
congratulations , gentlemen , you may think you &apos;re poor ,
but you are not poor enough to have a public defender .
so we have three bar attorneys here for you today .
if you want to find your own attorney ,
you will have to wait until tonight
after the bond hearing ,
which of course will push your hearing till tomorrow ,
but still it &apos;s up to you .
do you understand ?
bully .
next , male 26-- uh , where are you ?
let &apos;s get 12 more before lunch .
your honor , this is mr. howard &apos;s fifth arrest ...
exactly , which is why we ask that ...
four times he has received bail ,
and all four times he has shown up for
his scheduled court appearance .
bully for him--
he may be a thief but he &apos;s a prompt thief .
your honor ...
bail is set at $ 30,000 .
male 27 , criminal damage to property .
interesting strategy .
thanks .
male 28 , manufacture and distribution of a controlled substance .
uh , mr. roland ... &quot; hah @-@ lavin &quot; ?
&quot; lavin , &quot; uh , it &apos;s okay-- everyone gets it wrong .
oh , sorry , mr. hlavin , i &apos;m alicia florrick .
i &apos;m a bar attorney made available to you
by the chicago bar association for your convenience .
you &apos;re not required to hire me ...
uh , i know this .
the judge already said all this .
so , uh , i want you .
good , thank you .
okay , this is your cbr ; it &apos;s how i get paid .
my fee is standard , $ 135 for the first day ...
look , i used to work at the tower of terror in disneyland ,
so i had to say the same thing over and over again for months .
i &apos;m very sympathetic to people
who have to say something by rote .
um , i &apos;ll just sign it .
okay , great .
are you currently employed ?
i was currently employed ,
and then they arrested me , so now i &apos;m not .
any ties to the community ?
um , all my friends are in california .
stanford , class of 2011 .
they built tech start @-@ ups , i came here ,
okay , i don &apos;t need ...
i opened a chemistry lab ,
because i love chemistry , you know ?
i love drugs . i don &apos;t ...
i mean , i don &apos;t love using drugs ...
okay , mr. hlavin , unfortunately we don &apos;t have a lot of time .
you were arrested with someone .
yeah , my dealer .
i mean , not my dealer .
he &apos;s the dealer who sold my ghb ...
male 28 and 29 , intent to manufacture and sell .
okay , let me talk for you , don &apos;t say anything .
that might be hard .
i know , but try .
your honor , mr. roland hlavin was caught
manufacturing ghb with the intent to sell ,
and mr. pierre @-@ paul was caught selling it .
your honor , the state has seized over $ 2 million
of my client &apos;s money .
he has been impoverished by the state &apos;s actions .
as has my client , your honor .
and now they want to imprison him
with this onerous bail amount .
this is the definition
of cruel and unusual ...
really ?
cruel and unusual ? before lunch ?
your honor , my client just wants his day in court .
state requests that bail be tied
to the street value of narcotic seized .
approved . bail is set at $ 300,000 each .
enjoy .
i have an offer .
for both of us ?
no , one of you .
this case matters to the state &apos;s attorney .
he &apos;s offering an exploding plea .
oh , come on .
we &apos;re not turning on each other .
yeah , we &apos;re a united front .
one year to whoever jumps first .
the other gets 25 .
deal explodes in 45 minutes .
starting now .
one year , roland , that &apos;s the offer .
if you don &apos;t take it , your dealer friend will .
he will go to the prosecution
and tell them everything he knows about you .
every transaction , how much you sold .
how much you bought , how much you paid .
he &apos;ll turn on you .
you have to take this deal .
and we only have 40 minutes .
yeah , but that means going to jail , right ?
yes , but , it &apos;s one year versus 25 .
this is a lifeline .
what happened to my &quot; day in court &quot; ?
that was just a strategy to get you out on bail .
but i think i want it , though .
roland .
you were caught selling 50 @-@ gallon drums of ghb .
six of them ...
no .
yes , six .
no , uh ...
all right , look .
after stanford , i came back here .
i got a job at ibm ,
but my brother , he od &apos;d on ghb
at a company party so i quit .
now , ghb gives the user a feeling of euphoria ,
but take it in combination with alcohol and you stop breathing .
roland , we don &apos;t have much time .
i thought i could make it safer .
i felt like i owed that to my brother .
so i did .
this is ghb .
this is what i made .
i call it &quot; snowball chi , &quot;
it &apos;s a designer drug .
your body turns it into ghb
on contact with stomach acid ,
but when you take it or when i sell it ...
it isn &apos;t ghb .
it isn &apos;t illegal .
damn it . i &apos;ll be right back .
don &apos;t make the deal .
what deal ?
they weren &apos;t selling ghb-- it &apos;s a synthetic .
it &apos;s not on the controlled substances list .
so ? they &apos;ll say it &apos;s an analogue .
it &apos;s still illegal .
they &apos;ll say it &apos;s substantially similar .
not in chemical structure .
they &apos;re just trying to get us to jump
because they know it &apos;s not a listed drug--
don &apos;t make the deal .
i did .
i already did .
you just sent your client to jail for no reason .
grace , hi , i need you to call jason ,
get him on an hourly .
tell him i need an expert witness
on synthetic drugs .
okay , &quot; synthetic drugs . &quot;
right . which case is this ?
roland hlavin ;
there &apos;s a silent h before &quot; lavin . &quot;
oh , and i need a friend
or someone who can testify for him .
get me any background .
this is a paying customer ?
well , not yet .
but he may be getting $ 2 million
back from the police .
uh , got to go , grace .
i &apos;ll call you back .
so , this is where you work these days ?
eli , i have allocution in a minute .
can we do this another time ?
do what ?
whatever it is you &apos;re here to do .
have you heard of mama &apos;s homespun cooking ?
do i ... ? what ?
mama &apos;s homespun cooking .
it &apos;s a cooking show .
i need you go on it
with veronica tomorrow live .
i know , that &apos;s what i thought , too , at first .
okay , eli .
i &apos;m a little too busy to deal
with just random words
spouting out of your mouth .
here &apos;s the thing-- you can be yourself .
i want you to be yourself .
on a cooking show ?
with my mother ?
yes .
it &apos;ll be fun . we &apos;ll have fun .
and more importantly , you say yes to this ,
you can say no to a dozen other things .
why can &apos;t i say no
to a dozen other things now ?
because you want to steer events .
you don &apos;t want events to steer you .
yes , this is alicia florrick .
who is this ?
hi , it &apos;s howard .
howard , i can &apos;t help you right now .
i just need something fast .
howard , i don &apos;t have the time .
i need jackie &apos;s number .
you ... ?
jackie florrick .
why ?
i want to ask her out .
mr. hav @-@ lavin , on the charge
of manufacturing a controlled substance ,
how do you plead ?
where &apos;s your lawyer ?
here , your honor .
and why aren &apos;t you here ?
i am now , judge .
mr. hlavin pleads not guilty .
ah , okay .
and mr. pierre @-@ paul , you are charged
with just one count of distribution .
how do you plead ?
counselor ,
are we having a moment of reflection here ?
lucca ?
don &apos;t take the plea .
uh , not guilty ?
your honor , i ...
the defendant reversed herself .
we , we had a deal .
well , first of all , the defendant is a he .
and second of all , that deal has nothing
to do with this court , mr. mcgrath .
if she says yes to you ,
she can change her mind .
we are set for pre @-@ trial motions this afternoon .
i imagine you &apos;re moving
to dismiss , counselors ?
yes , your honor .
bully , we &apos;re done here .
lunch .
you screw me like that and i will screw you back .
have at it .
okay , i just made an enemy i don &apos;t need .
this better work .
no one reaches the summit on her own .
women help women .
i &apos;ve mentored exceptional women .
alicia florrick was one of them .
but now that she &apos;s running her own firm ,
i would like to mentor someone new .
and i &apos;d like it to be you .
naomi , your work is very good ,
very diligent .
and i think your legal opinions are sometimes bold .
never pays to be conservative .
thank you .
so , i &apos;d like to meet once a week or so
and talk about strategies for advancement .
will it mean more hours ?
no .
i only ask because i &apos;m not sure
i can squeeze it all in .
i have a boyfriend now .
we met online .
you understand
this is an honor ?
yes , completely .
and thank you . it &apos;s just ...
ryan &apos;s on the fast track at belvedere
and we &apos;re trying to keep some time for each other .
i &apos;m worried about my last relationship .
i was so focused on my career and where that was headed
that i completely cut out any romantic ties in my life .
and now it &apos;s been about three years since i even went on a date
and then i met ryan online and that was really exciting for me .
and he has most beautiful hair .
do these new summer interns seem less committed to you ?
no . do they to you ?
yes .
well , i think
every outgoing generation of lawyers
looks at the incoming crop and thinks they &apos;re not worthy .
yes .
but this generation isn &apos;t .
they &apos;re worried about their boyfriends and their long workdays .
they &apos;re looking for more balance in their lives .
more leisure time .
that &apos;s a good thing .
let &apos;s get the equity partners together today .
okay , why ?
to talk about alicia .
like ghb , tert @-@ butyl 4 @-@ hydroxybutanoate
contains a gammahydroxycarbonyl moiety .
but that &apos;s the only similarity .
the change in the chemical design is really quite elegant
when you look at it .
thank you .
no , no , sir , this is not your courtroom ; it &apos;s mine .
our apologies , your honor . it won &apos;t happen again .
and this new chemical compound that my client created--
it contains no illegal attributes ?
that is correct .
tert @-@ butyl 4 @-@ hydroxybutanoate
is electrically neutral ,
while ghb is an ionic compound .
so , would that be like the difference between coke and pepsi ?
no , it &apos;s more like
the difference between a butyrate @-@ co @-@ a ligase
and a glycine n @-@ acyltransferase .
thank you , doctor .
dr. marcotte , the federal analogue act
does not require that a drug be listed as a controlled substance
for it to be illegal-- is that correct ?
that &apos;s my understanding .
if it is substantially similar to a controlled substance ,
it is treated as though it were a controlled substance ?
objection . the witness is not qualified to answer a legal question .
and yet , this is a motion to dismiss .
and as much as you three are treating it like a full @-@ on trial ,
i have a life ,
i &apos;d like to get back to it , so overruled .
do you want me to repeat the question , doctor ?
no , you are correct .
an analogue of a drug is treated ,
under the law , as an illegal drug .
and isn &apos;t it also true
that no matter how elegant the defendant &apos;s attempt to elude the law is ...
objection !
i &apos;ll rephrase .
no matter how elegant
this new chemical compound is ,
the high associated with it is identical to ghb ?
yes , that is definitely true .
your honor , once again , the federal analogue act
makes it illegal to produce or sell any drug
that is only a few molecules away from a controlled substance .
it &apos;s not a few molecules away .
it is the difference ...
between coke and pepsi-- yes , i get it .
points for making this folksy ,
counselor , but your motion to dismiss is denied .
damn it . i thought we had it .
what ?
we still might .
oh , thank you .
this is your office ?
yes , i &apos;m thinking of having it painted .
what do you think ?
oh , um , excuse me .
oh , thank you . thank you so much .
oh , i ...
i &apos;m still moving in .
yeah , yes . i can see that .
um ... oh , oh , no ...
no , i &apos;ll go back here .
okay .
um , mr. gold ?
i really don &apos;t know how i can help you .
in fact , i @-@ i don &apos;t know
if the governor would want me to help him .
well , we &apos;re trying to show what a strong family peter has .
oh , sorry .
and there &apos;s something you can help us with .
have you heard of ...
mama &apos;s homespun cooking ?
no , i haven &apos;t .
what is that ?
it &apos;s a reality show .
oh , sounds delightful .
and i &apos;d like you to appear on it with alicia .
sorry .
it &apos;s @-@ it &apos;s @-@ it &apos;s a show
where you would teach alicia a recipe .
oh , sorry .
a new recipe she would then cook for her family .
and i &apos;d love for you to participate .
oh , i wouldn &apos;t miss that for the world .
okay , a few updates .
the turnbow depositions will start on wednesday .
what about the cliven @-@ hartford suit ?
settled .
$ 1.2 million in damages
and remediation for facilities in peoria .
well , someone had a good nap .
would you mind repeating that ?
what ?
i just want to make sure everybody heard it .
oh , it was a joke .
i know . could you say it exactly the way you said it before ?
i said , &quot; someone had a good nap . &quot;
thank you .
carry on .
yes .
well , now that we &apos;re all up to speed ,
uh , i want to discuss alicia .
i think we should turn the temperature down with her .
do you want to invite her back ?
we do that , we lose reese dipple &apos;s business .
i &apos;m afraid david &apos;s right ,
but we could feed her our overflow .
overflow ?
you mean overflow cases ?
yes , it &apos;s financially negligible to us ,
but it could help her .
it could also help neutralize her as a potential pawn for canning .
she &apos;ll be our pawn instead .
howard ?
i &apos;m checking to see who &apos;s here .
oh , would you excuse me ?
uh , are there any opinions on this sub ... ?
this is howard .
oh , hello , this is jackie florrick returning your call .
uh , did you need alicia &apos;s number ?
oh , no , i was calling for you .
well , well , how may i help you ?
i , uh , haven &apos;t done this in quite a while ,
so i &apos;m a , i &apos;m a little rusty ,
but , uh ,
would you like to have dinner with me ?
intent .
what &quot; intent &quot; ?
the federal analogue act has a scienter requirement .
you have to know what you were doing .
you had to know that you were making an analogue drug .
yes , but roland did know .
he knew he was making an analogue of ghb .
yes , but he hasn &apos;t testified to that .
look , my client
didn &apos;t know he was buying an analogue to ghb .
he thought he was buying ghb .
so he can &apos;t be prosecuted for buying a controlled substance ,
because it wasn &apos;t one .
he can only be prosecuted for purchasing an analogue ,
but only if he knew it was an analogue ,
which he didn &apos;t .
it &apos;s a catch @-@ 22 .
yes . a very neat one .
but it only works for my client ...
if he thought he was making actual ghb ,
not an analogue .
that &apos;s right .
you &apos;re not a chemist , roland .
you studied computer science , right ?
yeah , but i did a lot of research .
i mean , you know , i love learning .
wait , hold on .
is there a chance that while you , in fact ,
made tert @-@ butyl whatever ,
you were trying to make ghb ?
tert @-@ butyl 4 @-@ hydroxybutanoate .
your intent is important here .
what you intended to do .
no . wait .
don &apos;t say anything yet .
you can &apos;t be convicted of making ghb ,
because it wasn &apos;t ghb .
you can only be convicted of making an analogue .
but if you thought you were making ghb ...
if you didn &apos;t know you had created an analogue ...
no intent .
right .
to be clear ,
i &apos;m just telling you what your dealer
is going to testify to .
i &apos;m saying that could be your defense ,
if you were trying to make ghb .
so ... no rush .
take a moment and think .
so what were you trying to make ?
ghb .
so you never intended to make an analogue drug .
uh , no .
i thought i was making the real thing .
objection .
what &apos;s your objection ?
he &apos;s just admitted he was trying to manufacture a controlled substance .
yes , but he didn &apos;t succeed in making a controlled substance .
he made an analogue-- i imagine you &apos;re arguing &quot; by accident . &quot;
yes , your honor .
it &apos;s a little cute ,
but it does put you in a bind , mr. asa .
this is semantics .
no . it &apos;s the law .
you know the difference ? i get a gavel .
your honor , we move to dismiss .
hold on , i still get to cross .
you do . mrs. florrick , keep your motion handy .
mr. hlavin ,
how did you know how to make ghb ?
read it online .
and if you were trying to make ghb ,
why did you give it a new name ?
snowball chi sounded cooler .
i &apos;m pretty good at marketing .
i mean , i &apos;m pretty good at most things .
not at making ghb , apparently .
excuse me ?
i &apos;m just saying
you set out to make one thing
and you made something else . that &apos;s a failure .
objection , your honor . badgering the witness .
it &apos;s not much of a badger . overruled .
i didn &apos;t ... it &apos;s not a failure .
you &apos;ve never held a job in chemistry , have you ?
no . so what ?
and you were arrested during your third drug deal ?
fourth .
so you &apos;re not one of these
designer drug geniuses .
you didn &apos;t make something safer or smarter or better .
you &apos;re just a kid who tried to make something off the internet
and you botched the job !
no , it is better .
oh , so you knew you were making something different ?
i knew i was making something that saves lives .
not like ghb ?
that &apos;s right !
thank you .
no further questions .
mrs. florrick ,
your motion to dismiss is denied .
your client will stand trial .
yeah . hey , grace , what &apos;s up ?
there &apos;s something up with your client .
he didn &apos;t go to stanford .
yes , he did . class of 2011 .
no-- yes .
i mean , yes , he &apos;s on the alumni web site ,
but i called the school .
they don &apos;t have a record of anyone with that name .
ever . neither does ibm .
and the home address on his arrest report ?
there &apos;s a cuban family living there .
grace , what &apos;s going on ?
i have no idea .
but your client doesn &apos;t seem to exist .
i have to be out of here in an hour , eli .
me , too .
why ? where are you going ?
i have things to do .
you &apos;re not the only person who works , you know .
i hear you &apos;re punishing yourself .
punishing ?
that &apos;s what owen says .
working for nothing ,
helping the great unwashed .
i &apos;m starting over ,
and it &apos;s a good feeling .
like every new husband . a good feeling--
for the first few months , then ...
why isn &apos;t peter helping you ?
eli ?
don &apos;t ask me .
alicia ?
mom , have you been drinking ?
what ? no . it &apos;s 2 : 00 in the afternoon .
i can smell it on your breath .
i had a little wine at lunch , but i haven &apos;t been drinking .
oh , my god .
let &apos;s go , ladies . we &apos;re gonna have some fun .
i &apos;ll be there in a second .
eli , get her some mints or something .
so i couldn &apos;t find any other discrepancies in his story .

he &apos;s all over social media .
he &apos;s bragging about his new drug ,
talking about his brother .
but ... ?
but then i ran his mug shot
through facial recognition software
and i got a hit .
you did all that ?
i know .
well , zach helped .
so what is it ?
roland .
but he &apos;s in a group of fbi agents .
he &apos;s fbi ?
if that &apos;s him , he is .
mrs. florrick , ready to go .
so , as a working woman--
the mother of two ,
not to mention the wife of the governor--
how do you do it ?
manage it all ?
oh , well , with great help from my mother .
she &apos;s always there when you need her .
so , what &apos;s your go @-@ to meal , veronica ?
well , mama jill ,
i &apos;d have to say that right now , it &apos;s ordering pizza .
well , there &apos;s nothing wrong with that , is there ?
every once in a while .
but today you &apos;re gonna teach alicia
how to make your special lasagna .
yes , my special lasagna .
you remember , dear ,
my special lasagna that i made for you all those years ?
yes , mom , i can &apos;t wait to taste it .
you may have noticed the tone of alicia &apos;s voice .
the irony in it .
i guess i just wasn &apos;t a very good cook when she was growing up .
but you must be making up for lost time .
yes , i &apos;ve had to step up , haven &apos;t i ?
oh , really ? is that what this has been ?
yes . it has .
oh , i know , you &apos;re making fun , but it has .
ever since , you know ... the issues .
mom ...
yeah , what i mean to say is ,
a mother needs to be with her daughter when things get ... difficult .
so what other preparation ... and when i say &quot; difficult , &quot;
i &apos;m not talking about marital difficulties .
mom , why don &apos;t we just change the subject ?
don &apos;t patronize me .
get me eli gold !
i &apos;m not saying what you think i &apos;m saying .
i stayed away for two years
because you didn &apos;t call me .
mom , i didn &apos;t call you
because i didn &apos;t know where you were .
so what about this lasagna ?
thought you might &apos;ve forgotten me .
who was your faculty advisor at stanford ?
what ?
in the computer science department .
um , no one in particular .
but what was his name ?
um ... i don &apos;t know .
why is there a cuban family living in your apartment ?
maybe you called the wrong number ?
what &apos;s the right number ?
why are you asking me this ?
because you &apos;re not who you say you are .
and you sabotaged my defense strategy
and i want to know why .
look , i didn &apos;t mean to .
i &apos;m sorry , i ...
lost my temper .
that &apos;s you .
are you in bed with the fbi ?
are you an informant ?
that &apos;s not me , mrs. florrick .
you don &apos;t have to lie to me .
you &apos;re covered by attorney @-@ client privilege .
okay . so this is what &apos;s going to happen :
i &apos;m going to the judge
and i &apos;m going to ask to be relieved as your attorney .
i can &apos;t let you do that .
you have no choice .
yeah , i do .
i don &apos;t think you want me going to the judge
and telling him how you got me to perjure myself .
what did you say ?
no , it &apos;s what you said .
&quot; you can &apos;t be convicted of making ghb if it wasn &apos;t ghb .
you can only be convicted of making an analogue .
but if you thought you were making ghb ... &quot;
i never told you to lie .
in fact , i explicitly told you not to lie .
let &apos;s let the judge decide .
who are you ?
doesn &apos;t matter .
all that matters is that you keep representing me
until i get my day in court .
eli ?
over here .
this is your office ?
i know .
but once i get some plants and pictures ...
i think it could really be something .
what &apos;s wrong ?
i &apos;m being set up .
no , ruth wouldn &apos;t go after you .
not ruth .
the fbi .
what are you talking about ?
i have a client who i thought was a drug designer .
but i think he &apos;s an fbi informant .
as part of his defense ,
i was walking him through a few different case scenarios .
i explained the implications of each
and i let him decide how he wanted to testify .
is that a lawyerly way of saying you helped him lie ?
no .
but it could be interpreted that way .
what are you thinking ? enemies of peter ?
or you .
it &apos;s a primary .
anything could happen .
so what do i do ?
just ... let me find out what &apos;s happening
and i &apos;ll get back to you .
oh , wait , was the strategy yours
to get your client to lie ?
it wasn &apos;t a lie .
okay . okay . but was the strategy yours ?
no . it wasn &apos;t .
whose was it ?
eli , you &apos;re not ...
oh , mrs. florrick , hello .
ruth .
thank you for your time today .
cooking .
yes , it was a ...
unusual experience .
i hope you got what you needed out of it .
a lot came out of it .
i just wish we had another chair .
we could have a prayer circle .
um , well , i should go .
thank you , eli .
i &apos;m gonna get in here .
excuse me .
thank -- bye .
bye @-@ bye .
you told her to tank the cooking show ?
i didn &apos;t need to .
alicia and her mom do not have
what you would call a &quot; traditional &quot; relationship .
if you &apos;d worked with her longer ,
you would know that .
when you hurt me , you hurt peter .
i do not want to hurt either of you .
eli gold , what am i gonna do with you ?
you could quit .
my mom should be here soon .
can i get you anything ?
oh , no , thank you .
i &apos;ll just wait here .
diane ?
alicia .
i &apos;m so sorry to barge in like this .
oh , no , don &apos;t be sorry .
i &apos;m sure we can take a break from whatever we &apos;re doing .
oh , yes .
there &apos;s a lot of calls to return ,
but i &apos;ll hold them , mrs. florrick .
thank you .
uh , first , let me just say
how impressed i was
with the way you handled the smulders inheritance .
thank you .
you &apos;re welcome .
we seem to have an overload of cases
and not enough associates to handle them .
the partners and i met , and , um ,
we would like to give a few of them to you .
uh ... thank you .
they &apos;re not huge cases .
i &apos;m not a huge firm .
how is it , being on your own ?
it &apos;s been a bit of a struggle , but ...
actually not bad .
big firms aren &apos;t what they used to be .
well , it sounds like business is good .
you have an overload of cases .
yes , i guess it is good .
diane , will you excuse me for a minute ?
so , your guy is a lying egomaniac .
do you trust him to get through trial ?
no .
well , we can &apos;t put him on the stand again .
i don &apos;t need him dragging my client down .
your strategy , the catch @-@ 22,
are you always so creative with the truth ?
i am when i &apos;ve been pushed to reject a one @-@ year deal .
i think we should sever our cases .
separate trials , separate juries .
yeah , sure .
great meeting . thanks .
screw you .
the state calls scott pierre @-@ paul .
mr. pierre @-@ paul , do you have reason to believe roland hlavin
knew he was making a designer drug ?
yeah , he knew .
he marketed it as an alternative to ghb .
said it was safer , no adverse side effects .
and did he ever claim that his drugs
were better than ghb ?
yeah .
yeah , that was the whole point .
his testimony is gonna convict you .
we need to come clean .
about what ?
about you , who you are .
no .
you think that the fbi is gonna protect you
if you don &apos;t give up your identity , but they &apos;re not .
you &apos;re supposed to do what i want .
no , i &apos;m supposed to defend you .
mrs. florrick ,
i realize this rather damning testimony
is upsetting to both you and your client ,
but could you please hold it down ?
your honor , may ...
may we approach ?
no .
by all means .
it &apos;s not like we &apos;re in the middle of anything .
wait ! young man , sit down !
i &apos;ve asked my lawyer not to do this , your honor .
what is she doing ?
i need to speak with my lawyer .
please , may we have a recess ?
make it quick .
because i am an undercover fbi agent .
and you are coming very close to blowing my case .
what case ?
i &apos;m your defense attorney .
you don &apos;t want me to defend you ,
then fire me .
it &apos;s a sting .
of who , me ?
no .
then let me go to the judge and brief him .
no , the judge ...
is the target .
schakowsky ?
he will be offered a bribe
to dismiss all charges against me .
if he does , he will be arrested .
does lucca know ? does the asa ... ?
no and no . no one knows ,
not even the cops who arrested me .
you went to all this effort .
the bureau is cracking down on corruption
in state legislatures and judiciaries .
now , we need you
to go back in there and continue this case .
when the prosecution rests , move for dismissal .
on what grounds ?
you don &apos;t need grounds .
schakowsky will have taken the bribe by then .
he dismisses the case ,
we arrest him .
now , alicia ,
you have no choice in this .
move for dismissal .
any kids , howard ?
no .
i hated kids .
you have a lovely laugh .
my mother hated my laugh .
she forced me to eat a garlic clove every time i laughed .
you &apos;re kidding .
no .
you have a beautiful laugh .
refined .
what &apos;s wrong ?
nothing . it &apos;s ...
just been so long since i &apos;ve been happy .
hello , alicia .
yeah , i wanted to talk to you about this ageism suit .
no , i think i changed my mind .
i don &apos;t want to bring the suit .
i just found out what &apos;s going on with howard .
why he &apos;s acting so weird .
what is it ?
he &apos;s bringing an ageism suit against us .
for what ? what have we done ?
i don &apos;t know .
and you know who &apos;s helping him ? alicia .
how do you know that ?
i heard him on the phone with her .
you need to fire him .
you fire him , you give him what he wants , a cause .
no , we fire him for cause .
next time he exposes himself to a client .
my guess is , alicia advised him not to do anything stupid ,
and he &apos;s boned up on all the cases
in order to appear smart .
diane , where are you going ?
i checked with landau .
he has sources at the fbi .
they &apos;re not after you .
i know .
which means ...
they &apos;re after peter . i got to make a few calls .
no , eli , i was wrong .
what do you mean ? it &apos;s not the fbi ?
no , it is . i ...
then let me make a few calls . if it &apos;s a sting ,
the more exposure they have , the more they have to back off .
eli , you can &apos;t make those calls .
why not ?
because it &apos;s not about me .
it &apos;s about the judge , schakowsky .
it &apos;s a bribery sting .
they pulled the exact same thing
in philadelphia earlier this year .
excuse me .
diane , hi .
tell me something , alicia .
are you always gonna be looking for ways
to get back at me ?
excuse me ?
i thought we had smoothed things over .
i championed you to the other partners .
i got them to agree to send you our overflow .
you accepted my generous offer ,
all the while actively trying to betray me .
betray you ?
i don &apos;t ...
you &apos;re representing howard .
no , i &apos;m not .
you didn &apos;t give him advice about bringing an ageism suit ?
that &apos;s privileged .
you told him exactly what he needed to do
in order to sue us .
diane , this is not what it seems .
actually , sometimes it is .
what is it about ?
howard ? i don &apos;t know , subpoenas maybe .
what did alicia say ?
nothing .
but she is advising him .
bitch .
hey .
what ?
so we tell him to take emeritus status .
we &apos;ve already been through that ,
but he does nothing for the bottom line ,
so we do have cause .
howard .
you wanted to see us ?
yeah .
uh , i just wanted to say , uh ,
i brought in the food service union .
excuse me ?
the food service union .
they were looking for new legal representation ,
and i landed them .
you convinced ronnie erickson ?
oh , yeah , nice guy .
friend of a friend .
$ 33 million in yearly billing .
just thought you three should know .
i take it they were impressed
with my friend ronnie &apos;s business ?
impressed ? they nearly wet themselves .
oh , that laugh . oh , my god .
a nine iron ?
145 yards , pin high .
i &apos;ll never do it again .
you should come with me sometime .
we &apos;ll take the wives .
deal .
speaking of wives , i have a favor , don .
shoot .
you &apos;ve got a case .
roland hlavin .
he &apos;s muriel &apos;s niece &apos;s kid .
he got caught doing something stupid .
i &apos;ll say .
but he &apos;s not a bad kid .
believe it or not ,
he was trying to do something good .
keep people from overdosing .
anyway ,
if there &apos;s any way
that you can dismiss his case ,
give him a slap on the wrist .
jail would break him .
let his aunt muriel have at him .
i can make it worth your while .
i know your son &apos;s been looking for a board seat
over at polytech .
i can make that happen .
all rise .
i understand the defense has a motion .
we do , your honor .
at this time , the defense moves for a dismissal of all charges .
on what grounds ?
the state &apos;s entire case relies on the testimony
of my client &apos;s former codefendant .
his most recent testimony
directly contradicts his earlier sworn statements .
he &apos;s simply not credible .
your motion is denied , mrs. florrick .
this case will go to trial .
let &apos;s pick a date , shall we ?
you tipped him off .
no , i didn &apos;t .
maybe he &apos;s just not corrupt .
have you ever thought of that ?
this was a two @-@ year investigation , and we had him .
apparently not .
yeah , you &apos;re fired .
nice meeting you , sir . good luck .
let &apos;s get started , people .
lot of cases backing up .
bar attorneys , let &apos;s go .
males 45 @-@ 56 , mrs . florrick .
and ...
males 57 @-@ 60 for you , ms. quinn .
your honor ...
i don &apos;t have time to discuss .
let &apos;s go .
male 45 ?
oscar massey , dui .
male 52 .
carter nicholas , exposed yourself in public ?
i &apos;m alicia florrick ,
i &apos;m a bar attorney made available to you
by the chicago bar association
for your convenience .
you &apos;re not required to hire me , but if you don &apos;t ...
thanks for doing that ,
warning me .
i probably never would &apos;ve touched that bribe anyway ,
but i hate the way the fbi turns friends against friends .
it &apos;s terrible , isn &apos;t it ?
yeah .
anyway ,
i certainly owe you one .
good , because i need a little help
with frank landau .
