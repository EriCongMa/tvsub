you &apos;re late .
nope . 30 seconds early .
good . learning to tell time .
i won &apos;t be in today .
what ? does jessica know ?
i don &apos;t tell jessica everything .
oh , it &apos;s like a &quot; harvey specter &apos;s day off &quot; kind of a thing ?
艾德 · 鲁尼和斯洛恩均为影片中主角
should i call ed rooney ,
see if we can get sloane out of school ?
not in the mood today .
life moves pretty fast
if you don &apos;t stop and look around once in a while .
what do you think about hardman running for managing partner ?
think he &apos;s going to win .
why ?
because you don &apos;t call for a vote
unless you have the votes .
good .
we need to tip the scales in her favor .
okay . what do you need me to do ?
i need you to step up . you &apos;re not going to like it .
and jessica can &apos;t know it came from me .
i gave hardman the road map to settling with tanner .
you voted for it .
haven &apos;t we done enough to jessica ?
we &apos;re not doing this to jessica ,
we &apos;re doing this for jessica .
we gonna cross the line with this ?
we &apos;ve been crossing lines
long before we even ever met .
how do i know the patriots aren &apos;t going 19 @-@ 0 ?
because no team from boston is going undefeated
when the road goes through new york .
you got that right .
goddamn patriots .
your dad called .
i &apos;ll call him later .
he always asks why the idiots in charge
haven &apos;t made you partner yet .
he &apos;s so proud . it &apos;s sweet .
he &apos;s right .
you have that look on your face .
louis is getting a secretary .
her name ...
is norma .
what is she , 100 years old ?
she won &apos;t last a week . you heard it here first .
oh , and jessica &apos;s on her way down .
so , you buried the jessica news
to lead with the louis news .
i &apos;m not apologizing for who i am .
hi , is this the location of the douchebag convention ?
it is now .
i thought you went to work .
i had to get this .
look at that . the world &apos;s smallest burrito .
which is why i got more .
breakfast of champions .
trevor , i can &apos;t .
i &apos;m a bike messenger .
i deliver packages , or people die .
am i gonna have to give you a code red ?
okay .
all you did was weaken a country today , kaffee .
well , what can i say ?
thank you .
really ? okay .
i gotta go to work .
remember , we &apos;re going out tonight , so ...
you know , don &apos;t be you .
oh , wait a minute . i still owe you from last week .
no , no , no , you get the dickhead discount .
oh , is that 30 % ? or is that the shit face coupon ?
same thing , because you &apos;re a shit face and a dickhead .
right , got it . have a great day !
later , asshole .
later .
shit .
i need your help on something .
show me the skulls , i &apos;ll crack &apos; em .
not for this . for this , i need your discretion .
i also need to know you &apos;ll take it seriously .
i haven &apos;t worked in the mail room in a long time , jessica .
someone &apos;s stealing from our clients &apos; escrow accounts .
why isn &apos;t daniel here ?
daniel &apos;s managing partner .
isn &apos;t that why daniel should be here ?
and i &apos;m in charge of the money .
you want to go to him with a solution , not a problem .
you don &apos;t always have to let your superiors know what you &apos;re up to .
i &apos;ll try to remember that .
really ? i thought you were under the impression you had invented it .
what do you need me to do ?
i need you to step up . do whatever you have to do to find out
who did it , and do it quietly .
i will .
and when i do ,
i want you to step up for me .
what do you want , harvey ?
i &apos;m an associate who kicks more ass
than any partner in this goddamn firm .
i want a seat at the table .
so many partners , it could be any one of them .
watson scares the kids , but i don &apos;t make him for the embezzler .
the embezzler ? he &apos;s not a batman villain .
and it &apos;s just that kind of thinking that has led you to not catching him .
i was just assigned this 15 minutes ago .
have you ever looked into dortch &apos;s eyes ?
yeah , he &apos;s cross @-@ eyed .
or is he ?
what does that even mean ?
is there a reward for this ?
yes . i make jessica happy , i make partner .
then we get a bigger office .
then i get a bigger office .
hey , i &apos;m helping you out here .
are you ?
what do you think about ginsberg ?
we need to follow the money .
which will lead straight to rutherford .
this would be so much more fun with margaritas .
okay , that &apos;s it . i need facts ,
and i need them right now .
well then , why did you ask me to guess who did it ?
i didn &apos;t .
then why am i here ?
i need you to tell me who handles these five escrow accounts .
well , that &apos;s easy .
zoe .
god , why didn &apos;t you just say so in the first place ?
get out .
if you want to talk to monica eton ,
call her yourself .
i called her ,
but she hung up the minute i said pearson hardman .
of course she did . she hates everybody here .
she doesn &apos;t hate you .
well , no ,
but that &apos;s because i &apos;m adorable .
see , i can &apos;t help you with that .
so why don &apos;t you try using your powers of adorability for good ?
not a word .
and that is not being adorable .
mike , seriously ,
this is not a small thing .
look , the last time you asked me to help you was about donna .
and look at how that turned out .
okay , that wasn &apos;t me , and this isn &apos;t that--
monica eton is not donna .
maybe not , but she still means something to me .
so tell me why i should convince her to talk to someone
who works at a firm that she hates .
because ...
you don &apos;t know the real reason why she left .
monica .
hey , it &apos;s so funny running into you .
louis , we both work here .
yeah . listen , i just wanted to tell you that
i joined the hudson racquet club .
you know , i just figured i &apos;d treat myself
for making junior partner .
good for you .
yeah , i &apos;d love to get you out on the court .
maybe like , if you &apos;re available saturday ?
i can &apos;t .
i can &apos;t saturday , but--
monica , louis .
harvey .
h @-@ dog .
no .
what ?
no , listen . i wanted to talk to you about--
crashing and burning with monica ?
i didn &apos;t crash and burn with her .
so why don &apos;t you stop quoting whatever &quot; b &quot; movie
that came from , and call me when you finally see amadeus .
salieri , mozart .
设计害死了音乐天才莫扎特
are you wearing braces ?
proudly .
walk me through that .
i will walk you through it .
uh , for starters , it costs $ 15,000--
okay , i don &apos;t have time for this .
i heard you had a closed @-@ door meeting with jessica .
i did . or i didn &apos;t .
either way , it &apos;s none of your business .
i just think it &apos;s weird when , you know ,
you have a one @-@ on @-@ one with her ,
when you &apos;re an associate and i &apos;m a junior partner .
proudly wearing braces .
for your information , it is a very small step
from junior to senior partner when you have straight teeth .
just know that people take you very seriously .
that tie . i have the same one .
i don &apos;t want to see it again .
what would he have said if you weren &apos;t wearing braces ?
what a dick .
mark my words , if i am ever in charge of anyone ,
i am going to be the most beloved leader
that those lucky bastards have ever seen .
you know what i &apos;d do , i &apos;d be--
h @-@ dog ? h @-@ dog ?
zoe lawford .
i &apos;m sorry , you are ?
the only man here who could beat you at pool .
uh , head @-@ to @-@ head is even .
i &apos;m up by one .
well , i thought you &apos;d given up altogether .
you don &apos;t call , you don &apos;t write .
i was just trying to give it a little time .
you know , letting mystery build back up .
you mean you didn &apos;t know i transferred to beautiful escrow .
hey , i have my finger on the pulse .
really ?
name three associates in tax law .
boring , more boring , and boring in a skirt .
oh ! august 3rd .
date of my transfer .
i did know .
we miss you up there .
we miss me , or you miss me ?
we miss you .
i need you .
you &apos;re here to look at my files , aren &apos;t you ?
i need you to type in your password
and leave for five minutes .
you &apos;re doing something wrong .
no , i &apos;m fixing something wrong .
fixing what ?
that , i can &apos;t tell you .
why ? don &apos;t trust me ?
i do . but if i tell you ,
then i &apos;m breaking someone &apos;s trust in me .
okay , let me just get this straight .
you &apos;re asking me to risk my job to help you
solve a mysterious problem for an unknown person ,
based on nothing but your word ?
that &apos;s exactly what i &apos;m asking .
oh my god , there &apos;s an emergency in wills and trusts .
thank you . cheers .
you ready ?
i am . hit me , hit me .
all right , um ... all right .
this guy . favorite movie .
grease .
2 .
yes , i agree with you .
oh . what about this ,
rico suave over here , what are you thinking ?
shaves his chest .
no . no , no , man ,
that &apos;s a thing that like , real men do now .
oh , i don &apos;t think so .
i &apos;m sorry ,
did he just say &quot; real men shave thers chests ? &quot;
oh , um , not-- not real men .
just me . that &apos;s all .
i like him . he &apos;s funny .
and hairless .
oh , i &apos;m jenny .
mike .
and just so you guys know , uh , he shaves his chest
because he is , i &apos;m very proud of him , an olympic swimmer .
i am .
is that right ?
so that &apos;s what you do when you meet girls , you lie ?
totally .
if they &apos;re hot .
we also buy them drinks , i &apos;m not sure if--
oh , we drink .
uh , yeah .
bartender ?
wait , no way a girl thought you were
a point guard for the knicks .
well , you &apos;ve never seen me dribble .
uh , i would like to know something about you that &apos;s not a lie .
i love my grandmother .
well , now we know why he &apos;s single .
come on , it &apos;s kind of sweet .
look , i-- i &apos;m not usually in it for him ,
but i really gotta step in here .
dude &apos;s a genius .
trevor , stop .
no , no , no ...
what do you mean , genius ?
all right .
it &apos;s not a thing , it &apos;s just--
no , no , no , here we go .
ask him a math question . hard as you want .
trevor .
hard as you want !
anything .
what &apos;s 75 times 863 , minus 10 ?
64,715 .
how do we know that &apos;s right ?
uh , it &apos;s right . it &apos;s right .
all right , think of a book you read in high school ,
he will recite the first page ...
i don &apos;t want to do this ,
verbatim .
i don &apos;t want to do it .
come on , come on , come on , just do it-- do it for me .
moby dick .
&quot; call me ishmael . some years ago ,
never mind how long ago precisely ,
having little or no money-- &quot;
old man and the sea .
&quot; the box with the baits was under the stern of the skiff
along with the club that was used to subdue the big fish-- &quot;
i know that one , that &apos;s not right .
oh , no , no , no . i got bored , i did page seven .
curious george .
i can &apos;t .
i can &apos;t do that .
what ? come on ,
you can do the other ones ,
you don &apos;t know curious george ?
i never read curious george .
you never read curious george ?
monkeys freak me out .
my girlfriend and i have to go to the bathroom .
i have to go to the bathroom .
and when we come back , these drinkies--
will be filled . absolutely , 100 % .
dude , what are you doing ?
are you trying to blow this ?
what are you talking about ?
i know that you have curious george ,
i &apos;ve seen it on your bookshelf .
for once , we don &apos;t have to lie .
my mom gave me that book . she read it to me every night .
i &apos;m not going to use it to just pick up some girl .
you don &apos;t have to do anything .
let me tell them . okay ?
you &apos;ll probably go home with both of them .
trevor . stop .
fine .
i hate your guts .
i followed the money .
let &apos;s hear it .
louis litt is the man we &apos;re looking for .
are you sure ?
i told you i followed the money .
which , by the way , he &apos;s been spending left and right .
you &apos;re talking about the braces .
$ 15,000 .
not to mention the hudson racquet club .
who knows what else ?
that club costs $ 60,000 a year .
what are you going to do ?
i &apos;m gonna break him down ,
and i &apos;m gonna crack him open .
you wanted to see me ?
i did .
well , if this is about norma ?
truth be told , we can do a lot better .
this isn &apos;t about norma .
pray tell .
how can your your newest junior partner
be of service to thee ?
pray tell ?
you can pray tell me
how the hell you got the nerve
to stand in front of my face
after what you did .
i couldn &apos;t help it .
all those late nights .
your fibers are so tantalizing .
what ?
i fell asleep on your couch ,
just once , because it &apos;s so damn soft .
not the topic of this conversation .
is this about the myspace profile ?
because i can take that down .
okay , fine .
you got me .
i &apos;ve copied the complete works of shakespeare
and i &apos;ve charged it to those bastards at cm ,
i regularly raid harvey &apos;s liquor ,
and i &apos;ve taken every raspberry @-@ bran bar from the kitchen
that we &apos;ve ever bought ...
louis ...
i need to know where stanley gets them , do you ?
enough !
well , should i just ...
what , pack my things ?
not necessary .
thank you , jessica .
thank you for your mercy .
louis .
yeah .
you will replace every one of those goddamn bran bars .
yes .
and , i promise not to walk barefoot in the library ever again .
out .
okay .
next time you bring me a name ,
make goddamn sure it &apos;s the right one .
i followed the money .
you got lost on the way .
you saying louis was framed ?
i &apos;m saying you shit the bed .
i gave you a job to do , and you promptly
asked for a seat at the table .
you want to sit with the grown @-@ ups ?
do your job like a man .
what ?
you need me to remove jessica &apos;s foot from your ass ?
you heard all that ?
intercom was on .
couldn &apos;t help myself .
has it ever been on before ?
has it ever been off ?
wait , what ?
i listen to your private conversations ?
gotta go .
wait .
what ?
i don &apos;t like to be wrong .
it made sense , harvey .
louis is the firm &apos;s financial wizard .
look . louis might not have done it ,
but he can help me figure out who did .
you &apos;re going to ask louis for help on something this big ?
when a dog smells a bone , he digs .
doesn &apos;t mean you have to tell him
what kind of bone he &apos;s digging for .
just so we &apos;re clear ,
i &apos;m gonna keep listening to your private conversations .
pickles .
peppers .
here you go .
here you go . that &apos;s fine .
oh yeah , that girl nikki called me .
oh , that &apos;s awesome .
i don &apos;t even know how she got my number , it &apos;s weird .
i do .
i asked her out . she wanted your number instead .
i didn &apos;t tell her about the curious george thing .
what ?
i don &apos;t know , it &apos;s--
i just felt like i kind of hit it off more
with that jenny girl , that &apos;s all .
the blonde ?
she &apos;s not even as hot .
i liked her better .
well , you can &apos;t do anything now .
girls have rules about that kind of shit .
wait a minute .
are you-- is this a snake ?
are you snaking my girl right now ?
no , i already did .
you called her ?
of course i did .
what a dick .
what ?
son of a bitch .
i--i don &apos;t have
rules against that shit .
okay .
aw , whatever . that nikki girl &apos;s pretty hot too .
yeah .
look at this clown .
he walks like he &apos;s got a rod up his ass .
nice haircut , guy .
man , if i ever look like that , shoot me .
monica , you work late all the time .
i &apos;m not 22 . you are .
all i &apos;m saying is , you work 80 hours a week
while studying for the lsats every night .
well right , but that &apos;s because this time next year
i want to be in law school , and five years from now
i want to be a lawyer .
five years from now , you &apos;re gonna be
a kick @-@ ass lawyer at pearson hardman .
how often does louis ask you out ?
every single day .
there are laws to protect you from
sexual harassment , you know .
believe me , the day i need a law to protect me from louis
is the day i stop being a lawyer .
busy ?
very funny , harvey , let &apos;s get to it , okay ?
because you happen to be interrupting
my lunchtime sanctuary .
you think i don &apos;t know lunchtime sanctuary
means staring at monica ?
first of all , i &apos;ll have you know that
i have been coming here way before her .
and i will be coming here every thursday at 1 : 00 p.m.
till the day i die .
now let me see your friend &apos;s financials .
why are the names all blacked out ?
because of how sensitive it is .
how sensitive is it ?
he works at a powerful firm .
i can &apos;t tell you which one .
they have an embezzler .
ahh , so that &apos;s what your
closed @-@ door meeting with jessica was about .
we &apos;re being hired by another firm .
i &apos;m sworn to secrecy .
if we can figure out who this is ,
a very big head will roll .
where ? hufton and wood ?
bagwell and rose ?
oh , come on . those assholes at jacobson and kearney ?
look , i told you , i was sworn to secrecy .
my god , this is just like a maze of raw data .
can you make any sense of it ?
yeah , i already have .
look at this .
see ?
he &apos;s setting up this patsy to take the fall .
he &apos;s not even gonna see it coming , what a &quot; smuck . &quot;
i &apos;m sorry , did-- did you just say ,
what a &quot; smuck ? &quot;
no , i said what a &quot; smuck . &quot;
you mean schmuck .
you know a schmuck , right ?
&quot; smuck . &quot;
monica ?
mike ross .
can i join you ?
chair &apos;s empty .
i appreciate it .
rachel said this was about one of my old cases ?
this is a lawsuit that we just drew up in your name ,
seeking $ 10 million in damages from pearson hardman .
should have seen this coming .
five years ago you got screwed .
one way to put it .
you had options you didn &apos;t explore .
and you &apos;re exploring them for me .
i can make what stopped you before go away , yes .
harvey will back your claim .
what about jessica ?
you don &apos;t need jessica .
why are you doing this ?
does it matter ?
no . it doesn &apos;t .
i don &apos;t want anything to do with this .
last five years haven &apos;t been easy for you , have they ?
you don &apos;t know anything about me .
i know you &apos;ve been working retail .
it &apos;s a boutique on park avenue , right ?
it &apos;s a good job ,
you &apos;re making what , maybe 40 grand a year ?
this is manhattan .
what , are you covering rent with that ?
so you &apos;re the new attack dog .
well , spot , i &apos;m not revisiting a story
i spent the last five years trying to forget .
just take it with you .
you may change your mind .
and if you call me , i &apos;ll come fetch .
it &apos;s daniel hardman .
what ?
he &apos;s been playing a shell game .
he &apos;s moving money out of one account and into another
for an entire year .
your partner sold you out .
daniel has never done anything unethical .
and the fact that you don &apos;t like him--
i know , isn &apos;t reason to falsely accuse him .
i &apos;m not .
you falsely accused louis .
i stake my career on this .
you are .
he did it .
shit .
he did .
you have to go to the d.a.
i &apos;m going to daniel .
who &apos;s not doing their job like a man now ?
i &apos;m giving him the courtesy of explaining himself .
you shouldn &apos;t .
what you do if it were me ?
come in .
oh . thanks .
are those for me , probably ?
yeah . that &apos;s a thing , right ?
uh , bringing flowers for the roommate of
the girl you &apos;re taking--
you &apos;re just gonna take one of those , okay .
who &apos;s gonna tell her ? you ?
you , lieutenant weinberg ?
that &apos;s from--
a few good men .
yeah .
yeah . i get hbo .
i love you !
uh , nikki is gonna be out any minute , so--
am i-- am i dressed okay , for her ?
um , you--yeah , you look fine . you look good .
good ?
yeah .
would--can you tell me the truth ?
you don &apos;t want the truth .
&quot; &apos; cause deep down in places you don &apos;t talk about at parties , &quot;
&quot; you want me on that wall , &quot;
&quot; you need me on that wall-- &quot;
hey , nikki .
oh , my , god .
that--uh , i-- wow .
those look beautiful .
so--so , do you .
so they-- -
i &apos;m gonna go put these in water .
okay .

are you ready ?
yeah .
then we , are ready
for dinner .
everyone &apos;s ready ,
isn &apos;t that great ?
good night .
that great ?
something i can help you with ?
you can help me understand why you &apos;ve been stealing from our clients .
jessica , i can--
oh , god damn it , daniel .
it was for alicia .
she &apos;s dying .
what ?
breast cancer .
stage four .
why didn &apos;t you say anything ?
she found a lump a year ago .
it was the worst day of our lives .
i have no words .
i thought i could handle it myself .
and the money ?
treatments . not covered by insurance .
why not ?
they &apos;re not in the books .
but i don &apos;t care .
she &apos;s not dying because i didn &apos;t spend the money .
you stole $ 1 / 2 million .
i don &apos;t expect you to forgive me .
what do you expect ?
i honestly don &apos;t know .
wild maine salmon , braised fennel ,
mushroom polenta , arugula salad ...
and do you really need me to keep doing this ?
you really are a genius .
sexy , right ?
what &apos;d you get on your sats ?
ooh , 1590 .
yeah , it was an ambiguous question . i don &apos;t know .
don &apos;t really like to talk about it .
oh , no , no , no . here , let me get that , c &apos;mon .
parents &apos; plastic .
they &apos;re cool .
cool .
listen , um ...
why don &apos;t we go back to your place ,
&apos;cause i live in brooklyn ,
and i &apos;m kind of in a strange roommate situation--
i want to pay you $ 1000
to take the lsats for me .
what ?
that &apos;s why you snaked me from jenny .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
unbelievable .
we &apos;re not all born geniuses .
and i need your help .
yeah , you might not be a genius ,
but you know exactly what you &apos;re doing .
and you &apos;re not getting my help .
come on .
what do you want ?
oh , i don &apos;t want anything .
because i &apos;m not your trained monkey .
tell your mommy thanks for dinner .
grammy !
oh my god , what &apos;s the matter ?
bob , what happened ?
relax , mike .
edith &apos;s fine , i &apos;m just gonna go get her a glass of water .
grammy , here , look at me . what happened ?
i don &apos;t know . i think the floor was wet .
the floor was wet , how did the floor get wet ?
we--it happened fast .
but i &apos;m okay .
but , what are you doing here ?
i thought you had a date .
uh , it di-- no , it didn &apos;t work out .
so , you came to see your grandmother .
that &apos;s not normal , michael .
rea--are we gonna do this , right now ?
thank you , bob ,
i really appreciate it .
that &apos;s what neighbors are for .
here , you drink that , and we &apos;ll be right back . okay ?
for what it &apos;s worth ...
the floor wasn &apos;t wet .
you know , if i were you , i &apos;d get full @-@ time care for edith .
are you crazy ?
did you hear me ?
his wife &apos;s dying of cancer .
so you &apos;re going to let him walk ?
no , nobody &apos;s walking .
the firm &apos;s taking out a loan against its assets .
daniel will pay it back .
great . my dad has gout , can i have $ 1 million ?
cold @-@ hearted son of a bitch .
you know those tuesday lunches at the harvard club ?
he &apos;s taking alicia to chemo .
he stole from our clients ,
which means he &apos;s stealing from us .
when it was louis , you were ready to
break him down and crack him open .
daniel is the reason why i &apos;m here .
he plucked me from the bullpen when i didn &apos;t know my ass from my elbow .
he saw a star to hitch his wagon to .
this is manhattan , harvey .
how many black women to you see
with their name on the door ?
you know what , he was smart to put your name first .
that way you might not notice that you &apos;d always be number two .
careful , harvey .
then again ,
maybe you &apos;re okay staying number two--scottie pippen ...
don &apos;t pull that shit on me .
we made a deal , and i honored it .
it &apos;s time for you to honor it .
wow , a man &apos;s wife &apos;s dying ,
and the first words out of your mouth are &quot; you owe me . &quot;
who &apos;s the bad guy now ?
you asked me what it &apos;s gonna take .
it &apos;s gonna take $ 5,000 .
keep your voice down .
why , am i making you nervous ?
yes .
good . now you know how i &apos;m gonna feel .
you &apos;re asking me to expose myself
so that you can go make a fortune .
so either you figure out how to pay me ,
or you roll the dice on your own .
but trust me when i tell you , these tests aren &apos;t easy .
well , they are for me .
okay .
good .
what made you change your mind ?
none of your business .
you &apos;re not monica .
oh , no , i &apos;m--
rachel zane .
how did you know that ?
i &apos;m donna . i know everything .
everything ?
you started three months ago ,
you have a peach yogurt every morning ,
you &apos;ve got a cute pair of suede pumps i totally plan on stealing ,
and your father &apos;s robert zane ,
name partner at rand , kaldor , and zane .
and , apparently , you don &apos;t like people knowing who your dad is .
well , they just-- they treat you differently .
your secret &apos;s safe with me .
no , it doesn &apos;t really matter .
i won &apos;t be here that long .
it is the cafeteria ?
because it is way better than it used to be .
nope . i live for foie gras fridays .
they don &apos;t have that .
don &apos;t they ?
you &apos;re weird . we &apos;ll be friends .
anyway , i should go . i &apos;m just gonna leave this stuff here for monica .
she should be back pretty soon .
she just has tuesday pilates at chelsea pier .
every tuesday ?
now , i thought you knew everything .
i do .
what are you so bouncy about ?
you &apos;re gonna be so happy that i listen to your intercom .
who is it ?
room service .
what are you doing here ?
delivering champagne . i see you can afford it
since the money you &apos;ve been stealing from our clients
hasn &apos;t been going to your wife &apos;s cancer treatments .
hey , monica , how &apos;s it going ?
harvey .
daniel and i need a minute .
letter of resignation .
you &apos;re gonna sign it ,
and then name jessica as your successor .
i don &apos;t think so .
unflinching in the face of defeat .
it &apos;s not defeat .
you come after me for embezzlement ,
every pearson hardman client you &apos;ve got is gone .
which is why jessica won &apos;t let me do that .
then why are you here ?
waiting for your wife .
what are you talking about ?
she &apos;s invited to a fund raiser .
she &apos;ll be at the front desk in three minutes .
you don &apos;t sign , they &apos;ll send her up to this room .
you do sign , they &apos;ll send her to another room .
you dragged a woman racked with cancer here
to blackmail me ?
you think it &apos;s me she &apos;s gonna have issue with ?
you goddamn bastard .
says the man cheating on his dying wife .
you don &apos;t know anything .
i do .
i &apos;ve seen you with her , and i know you love her .
and this has nothing to do with that .
i also know that you don &apos;t want the rest of alicia &apos;s life
spent picturing this .
if she wasn &apos;t sick , she could probably get over it .
she &apos;s not getting any better , daniel .
you have two minutes .
it &apos;s your call .
there &apos;s something i think you should know .
please .
mike ross had lunch with monica eton today .
i saw him hand her a filing .
and why do you think this concerns me ?
i just think that their meeting
on the eve of the firm &apos;s vote suggests
that jessica &apos;s making a move .
you &apos;ve been good to me since you &apos;ve been back .
she hasn &apos;t .
do what you will .
about time . i wasn &apos;t sure you &apos;d make it .
especially since you didn &apos;t give me a reason .
i &apos;ve got about 5,000 reasons .
we &apos;ll be fine .
oh , my god , you &apos;re high .
i &apos;m fine .
are you crazy ?
i &apos;m about to do something illegal , okay ?
it helps calm me down .
great , you &apos;ll be calm .
how the hell are you gonna handle the test ?
i don &apos;t know , maybe the same way i handled your little quiz the other night .
you were high .
and drunk .
now , if you &apos;ll excuse me , i &apos;ve got a test to take .
and i &apos;ve gotta miss a couple of questions on purpose .
it &apos;s done . hardman &apos;s gone .
harvey ...
what is it ?
i don &apos;t know how to say this .
just say it , donna . what ?
your dad ... he had a heart attack .
harvey , i &apos;m so sorry .
it &apos;s okay .
oh , my god .
good morning , monica .
jessica .
you look tired . did you get much rest last night ?
i want to explain .
i &apos;m not here for excuses .
then why are you here ?
to see you off .
my relationship with daniel
has nothing to do with my work here .
i need to know i can trust my people .
you &apos;re not my people .
you can &apos;t fire me .
i &apos;ll sue for wrongful termination .
which will lead me to implicate you in daniel &apos;s crimes .
i had nothing to do with that .
didn &apos;t you ?
diamond earrings , diamond bracelet ,
and trips to , let &apos;s see now ...
mexico ... france ... hong kong .
hope you liked that one .
i didn &apos;t know .
i don &apos;t care .
you are harvard @-@ educated lawyer .
do you think that a jury will believe
you had no idea where that money came from ?
don &apos;t do this .
louis will accept your resignation ,
and i will never see you here again .
经营合伙人
i expected a fight , but not a dirty one .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
mike ross met with monica eton .
and what does that have to do with me ?
i &apos;m disappointed that you felt the need to go there .
i &apos;m disappointed you think i did .
you really expect me to believe that you didn &apos;t--
stop right there !
you know , you might fight dirty ,
and harvey might fight dirty , but i don &apos;t .
what the hell are you doing ?
trying to get monica eton to file a sexual harassment suit
against daniel hardman ?
okay she left because of their affair ,
which he paid for with embezzled money .
that was five years ago .
and her life fell apart !
i know you think you &apos;re trying to help me ,
but drop it , immediately .
wow . that &apos;s what all this was about ?
nice performance .
i &apos;m trying to help jessica .
mike , you cannot keep me in the dark .
not when you &apos;re the one asking me for help .
couldn &apos;t take the chance that you wouldn &apos;t help .
you told me it was about one of monica &apos;s old cases .
you lied like it &apos;s second nature .
our backs are against the wall .
i did what i had to do .
and you &apos;re proud of that ?
rachel , sometimes you have to cross a line
to do the right thing .
harvey has really rubbed off on you .
i didn &apos;t learn that from harvey .
holy shit , dude .
pays to be a nerd .
yeah , but you still don &apos;t get the girls .
i don &apos;t know , i guess i &apos;m gonna use this
to get my grandma some help .
too bad it was a one @-@ time @-@ only deal .
actually , she has three friends
who want to use my services , so ...
oh , good .
we &apos;re in business .
&apos;cause you &apos;re gonna need to start paying
all the rent around here .
what ?
oh , did you think you were the only one
stepping up his game ?
meaning ?
what ? trevor , no , no , no . not a good idea .
no .
which is why i &apos;m moving out .
unless you want in , in which case ,
you know , i &apos;m still moving out .
but we could go together--
move into a much , much nicer apartment .
that &apos;s jenny .
first date .
could you not tell her about this ?
go get the door .
unbelievable .
jenny .
aren &apos;t you a sight for sore eyes .
daniel came in last night to pick up his things .
threw a phone at my head .
you duck , or is his aim that bad ?
he throws like a girl .
i &apos;m not surprised .
you needed me ?
i wanted you to be the first to know .
we have a new partner .
andrew mccutcheon . solid candidate .
a simple thank you would suffice .
me thank you ? never .
well , i have a partners meeting in five minutes .
i &apos;m gonna break the news that i &apos;m taking daniel &apos;s office .
who &apos;s taking yours ?
i &apos;m looking at him .
you &apos;d be pride .
jessica ...
thank you .
one last tip .
don &apos;t let louis in here after hours .
finally an office big enough for you balls .
okay , i am not touching that one .
you would if you had bigger balls .
hold on a sec , did you listen on jessica &apos;s intercom ?
no . she told me .
before me ?
well , i was the one to figure it out about daniel .
oh , and how did she know that ?
let &apos;s just focus on what &apos;s important .
you just made partner .
we just made partner .
i &apos;ll grab the can opener .
whoa , whoa , that &apos;s pre @-@ trial ritual .
we &apos;re making an exception .
i &apos;ll get the thumbtacks .
two dozen ?
three dozen .
going for the record !
zoe .
harvey .
is word out already ?
word about what ?
oh , don &apos;t be coy . i just made partner .
you &apos;re here to congratulate me .
i knew it . it was hardman , wasn &apos;t it ?
what do you want me to say ?
nothing .
i know how it is around here .
secrets and lies-- standard procedure .
i didn &apos;t build the sandbox , zoe .
no , you just like to play in it .
and you don &apos;t ?
no .
and i don &apos;t like watching what it &apos;s doing
to a man i care about .
zoe--
i &apos;m leaving .
today &apos;s my last day .
because of this ?
look , i did what i did for the good of the firm .
you think that &apos;s what i &apos;m talking about ?
do you know what this is ?
it &apos;s my condolences ,
which i expected to leave on your desk ,
because i thought you &apos;d be out mourning your father .
i had--
what , bigger fish to fry ?
don &apos;t you see ? that &apos;s what this place does .
there &apos;s always bigger fish .
i am dealing how i deal .
harvey , you &apos;ve lost your way .
一位慈父
how &apos;d it go yesterday ?
fine . mike pull it off ?
yep .
he suspect you were in on it ?
nope .
well , now they know .
gonna swing us some votes .
we threw daniel &apos;s ass out once . we &apos;ll do it again .
damn right .
