this is ross geller &apos;s personal physician , dr. filangie .

i discovered that ross forgot to take his brain medicine .
without it , in the brain of ross ... women &apos;s names are interchangeable .
through no fault of his own .
oh , my god ! phoebe .
no , not phoebe . dr. filangie .
oh , no ! you have it too !
what kind of bitch hangs up on a doctor ?
hi !
hey
i hope you don &apos;t take this the wrong way ...
... but i know we had plans to meet up tonight .
i &apos;m worried about what it might do to our friendship .
i know .
how could we have let this happen ?
seven times !
you know , look . we were away .
in a foreign , romantic country .
i blame london .
bad london !
so look ... while we &apos;re still in london , we can keep doing it , right ?
well , i don &apos;t see that we have a choice .
but when we &apos;re back home , we don &apos;t do it .
only here .
you know , i saw a wine cellar downstairs .
i &apos;ll meet you there in two minutes .
mon ? i gotta ask you something.now ?
ross said my name . i can &apos;t just pretend it didn &apos;t happen .
i don &apos;t know .
monica , what should i do ?
just do the right thing .
what ?
tow the line ! thread the needle ! think outside the box !
i &apos;ll talk to ross about what he thinks it meant .
wait ! rachel , no.he &apos;s married.married.
if you don &apos;t realize that , i can &apos;t help you .
okay . you &apos;re right.you &apos;re right . you can &apos;t help me .
jack , is it all our fault ? were we bad parents ?
yes
who serves steak when there &apos;s no place to sit ? how are you supposed to eat this ?
hey , what &apos;s up ?

sorry , dear , i only dance when i &apos;m drunk .
want me to get you something ?
where were you ? we were supposed to meet in the wine cellar ?
forget it . that &apos;s off .
why ?
the next tour of the wine cellar will commence in two minutes .
joey , what are you doing ? you promised , no meat till phoebe has the babies .
we &apos;re in another country , so it doesn &apos;t count .
true .
he &apos;s got a point .
i &apos;m sorry things aren &apos;t working out .
it could be better . it &apos;ll be okay , right ?
oh , yeah ! of course . she &apos;ll get over this .
so you said my name .
you just said it because you saw me there .
if you &apos;d seen a circus freak , you would &apos;ve said :
&quot; l take thee , circus freak . &quot;
it didn &apos;t mean anything . it &apos;s a mistake .
it didn &apos;t mean anything . right ?
oh , no ! of course it didn &apos;t mean anything .
i can understand why emily thought it meant something ... because it was you .
but it absolutely didn &apos;t . it didn &apos;t ! it didn &apos;t !
the band &apos;s ready for your first dance with emily .
oh ! the band &apos;s ready !
we &apos;ve got to do what the band says . i don &apos;t care about the stupid band !
you spit on me , man !
i &apos;m sorry .
emily is taking kind of a long time .
when i locked myself up at my wedding i was trying to pop the window out of the frame .
right
get the hell out of there . you know ?
emily , emily
i &apos;m coming in !
oh , look at that . same thing .
in the middle of everything , if i scream , &quot; yippee ! &quot; just ignore me .
oh , my god ! rachel ! -oh , hello , rachel .
ross said my name.okay ? my name !
ross said my name up there.that obviously means he still loves me !
don &apos;t believe me . i know i &apos;m right .
do you guys want to go and get a drink ?
yes , we do.but we have to change first .
yes , i want to change .
go get a table .
we &apos;ll only be five minutes .
fifteen minutes .
okey
oh , phoebe ! it &apos;s phoebe !
oh , hey , hey .
oh , great .
hi
so , what happened ?
well , ross said my name .
but i don &apos;t think that means anything .
let &apos;s look at this objectively .
ninth grade , right ?
the obsession starts .
then he sees me in a two @-@ piece for the first time .
his obsession begins to grow , right ?
why don &apos;t we go change in my room ?
my clothes are ....
wow , you look ... no time for that .
hey , dude ! let me in ! i got a girl out here !
i got a girl in here !
no , you don &apos;t . i saw you go in with monica .
well , we &apos;re hanging out .
which one of us will be having sex in there ? me or you ?
i suppose i would have to say you .
what if we &apos;re watching a movie ?
which we are ! and we &apos;ve paid for it.it &apos;s my giant .
my giant ? i love that movie !
think this is okay ?
well , ross and emily aren &apos;t going to use it .
oh , it &apos;s so beautiful !
i don &apos;t feel right about this .
oh mon @-@ mon @-@ mon @-@ mon @-@ look ,
this is the honeymoon suite.the room expects sex .
the room would be disappointed if it didn &apos;t get sex .
all the other honeymoon suites would think it was a loser .
okey , okey
emily ?
nope ! not under here !
you didn &apos;t find her ?
i &apos;ve looked everywhere .
you couldn &apos;t have , or you would &apos;ve found her .
keep looking !
yeah ! for about 30 minutes ?
or 45 ?
in 45 minutes , you could find her twice .
for all i know , she &apos;s trying to find me but couldn &apos;t , because i kept moving .
from now on , i &apos;m staying in one place.right here .
it &apos;s getting late .
we &apos;re going to go .
do you guys mind staying here for a while ?
we &apos;ve got to get up early and catch that plane .
yeah , it &apos;s a very large plane .
that &apos;s cool .
but we &apos;ll stay here with you .
thanks , guys !
i really appreciate this , but you don &apos;t need to rub my butt .
we have to leave in an hour .
i know .
i &apos;ve been looking at those doors.they look pretty soundproof , don &apos;t you think ?
we can &apos;t do that . that &apos;s insane .
i mean , a , he could wake up . and b , you know ... let &apos;s go for it .
emily ? emily
emily
nope .
she &apos;s not with us .
we &apos;ve come for her things .
where is she ?
she &apos;s in hiding . she &apos;s humiliated . she doesn &apos;t want to see you again .
we &apos;re very sad that it didn &apos;t work out between you and emily , monkey .
but i think you &apos;re absolutely delicious !
excuse me , i &apos;m standing right here .
oh , yes.there you are .
hurry up ! get some ! there &apos;s a whole cart outside .
goodbye , geller .
now , hold on . hold on .
your daughter and i are supposed to leave tonight for our honeymoon .
tell her i &apos;ll be at that airport , and i hope she will too .
i said rachel &apos;s name , but it didn &apos;t mean anything .
she &apos;s just a friend and that &apos;s all .
that &apos;s all ! now just tell emily that i love her and ...
... that i can &apos;t imagine spending my life with anyone else .
please , promise me that you &apos;ll tell her that .
all right , i &apos;ll tell her.come on , bugger face !
call me .
you spend your life in the bathroom . why do you never go out the window ?
maybe it &apos;s best we never got to do it again .
yeah , it kind of makes that one night special .
technically , we still are over international waters .
i &apos;m going to the bathroom . maybe i &apos;ll see you there ?
okey
can i ask you something ?
no
felicity and i watched my giant . and i thought :
&quot; i &apos;ll never be as good an actor as that giant . &quot;
do you think i &apos;m wasting my life with this acting thing ?
no
the giant &apos;s five years younger than me.you think i &apos;ll ever get there ?
yes
thanks , man .
okay , man .
but what about how much taller he is than me ?
i mean , there &apos;s no way i can make myself taller now .
who knows what science will come up with in the future ...
... but what if i die an unsuccessful , regular @-@ size man ?
you &apos;ve been in the bathroom for a half @-@ hour .
i know !
had the beef tips , huh ?
hi hi
you ate meat !
you had sex !
no , we didn &apos;t .
i know you didn &apos;t . i was talking about monica .
i did not have sex .
this pregnancy is throwing me all off
and making me fat .
i &apos;ll say hi to the chick and duck .
me too !
why would you need to ? you &apos;ve been feeding them .
oh , right . maybe i &apos;ll just go home .
we certainly are alone .
good thing we have that &quot; not new york &quot; rule .
okey
listen , since we &apos;re on that subject ...
... i just wanted to tell you that ....
i was going through a hard time in london ...
... with my brother getting married and that guy thinking i was ross &apos; mother .
right
well , anyway , i just .... that night meant a lot to me .
and i &apos;m trying to say thanks .
you know , that night meant a lot to me too .
it wasn &apos;t because i was in a bad place or anything .
it just meant a lot because you &apos;re really hot .
is that okay ?
that &apos;s okay .
and i &apos;m cute too ?
and you &apos;re cute too ! thank you .
all right , i gotta go unpack .
bye
i &apos;m still on london time . does that count ?
oh , that counts !
oh , good !
rachel
hi
