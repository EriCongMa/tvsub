who you were working for , hank ?
gabriel waincroft .
you &apos;re gonna get in contact with gabriel ,
and you &apos;re gonna tell him everything went down
just as you planned it , and if you do that ,
maybe you won &apos;t spend the rest of your life in prison .
fair enough .
what about the software that he uploaded onto our mainframe ?
we &apos;re gonna use it to catch gabriel .
inspector abby dunn , this is chin ho kelly .
aloha .
san francisco p.d.
is putting together a task force based on what we do .
you know , i really appreciate you jumping in
with both feet on this one .
i was hoping this trip was gonna be more
than just show and tell .
oh , yeah ? well , what do you think so far ?
i like what i see .
crime lab restored over 24 hours of deleted video footage
of a potential murderer .
yeah , that was all me .
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m just ...
this is eric russo . he &apos;s our new lab tech .
he &apos;s also detective williams &apos; nephew .
oh , cool .
by me .
this doesn &apos;t change anything .
can i help you ?
yeah , i &apos;d like to report two murders .
you can find the bodies in the makua kea &apos;au forest reserve .
how do you know this ?
because i put them there .
oh , my god , who is she ?
oh , my god .
i &apos;m professor jeffries , for those of you who cannot read .
i am your new teacher
for principles of microeconomics .
yo . overslept . sorry .
my bad .
next time that you &apos;re late for my class ,
please don &apos;t bother showing up .
okay ?
have a seat . thanks .
all right , uh , so i understand , uh ,
you &apos;ve been covering monopoly markets .
so if nobody has any questions ...
i have a question .
yes ?
what happened to professor thomas ?
is he , like , not gonna come back ?
no , i @-@ i don &apos;t think he will be coming back .
what is that ?
what are you guys eating ?
what &apos;s got you all riled up ?
oh , my god .
oh . oh , my god .
what &apos;s up with them ?
they &apos;re wiping the servers .
nobody touches the table until they &apos;re done .
wait a second . what happened to the plans ?
hpd sent this across this morning .
is that hank webber ? he &apos;s looked better .
yeah , somebody stabbed him
28 times in the yard this morning .
well , this is obviously
the work of gabriel waincroft .
maybe he found out that hank told us
about the virus he put in his computer .
but how could he possibly know that ?
well , my friend ,
that is a mystery that will only be solved
when we lock up gabriel waincroft .
we just lost the best chance we ever had of doing that .
you see , this is a chess game to him .
he just sent us a very clear message
that he is moves ahead .
mahalo .
remember now , hold on to that receipt .
gets you four percent off our half @-@ day catamaran cruise .
don &apos;t go anywhere until i &apos;m finished talking to you .
step back , honestly . get back .
i &apos;m serious . back off .
is there a problem ?
just having a private conversation .
brah , i don &apos;t know you . i &apos;m speakin &apos; to nahele .
you okay , or do i need to enforce my right to refuse service ?
just think about what i said .
who was that lolo ?
my father .
‭ hey , guys .
so , body &apos;s this way , at least what &apos;s left of it .
kono , i &apos;m surprised to see you here .
i thought you and adam had an appointment
with the prosecuting attorney &apos;s office ?
yeah , we already did .
they offered him a deal-- 24 months .
24 months ? goro &apos;s men kidnapped him and tried to kill him .
it was self @-@ defense .
that &apos;s not how the pa sees it .
to them , it &apos;s an opportunity
to lock up the son of a yakuza boss on a double homicide .
yeah , self @-@ defense or not , they can still charge him
with criminal possession of a weapon .
yeah , you know the worst part about this ?
adam doesn &apos;t even seem interested in fighting this .
and so , he &apos;s thinking of taking the deal .
chin , what do we got ?
ranch hand came out to feed the pigs ,
but found that they had already eaten .
max is working on an id now .
all right , remote location , middle of the night .
this wasn &apos;t an accident .
definitely a body dump .
this is an old organized crime trick .
pigs-- they can eat through bone .
they don &apos;t leave anything behind .
hey , max , how &apos;s it going in there ?
well , i &apos;m still looking for some identifying markers ,
such as teeth or fingers .
but i can tell you our victim is male ,
approximately mid to late forties .
fortunately , his liver &apos;s intact , so ,
temperature suggests t.o.d. to be
between 10 : 00 p.m. and midnight .
was he a hot or a cold meal ?
well , if you &apos;re asking whether the corpse was consumed
post or antemortem , i don &apos;t have an answer to that yet .
although ...
eureka !
高兴得来不及穿上裤子就跑到街上喊的话
i found a thumb !
did he just say &quot; eureka &quot; ?
yes , he did .
all right , max , we &apos;re gonna need to get that
back to the lab right away
and run the print though afis .
way ahead of you , commander .
and we have a hit !
our victim &apos;s name is elliot thomas .
appears to be on faculty at o &apos;ahu state .
guy &apos;s got no record .
not even a parking ticket .
all right , so , how does a solid citizen end up pig food ?
i don &apos;t know .
but i think i &apos;m done eating bacon .
when i heard what happened ,
i notified the campus police .
they discovered professor thomas &apos; car
had been here overnight .
they also found some of his belongings on the ground .
he was abducted right here .
yeah , i guess that makes this our primary crime scene .
dean letoa , i don &apos;t see any cameras around .
we &apos;re undergoing facility improvements .
we just installed cameras in the student lots ,
but we haven &apos;t quite got to the faculty yet .
well , we &apos;re gonna need to establish a timeline ,
so , um , do you have any idea
what the professor &apos;s schedule was last night ?
i know he had a lecture that ended at 8 : 00 .
look at this .
touch @-@ up paint .
somebody key his car ?
yes , uh , that happened here last month .
professor thomas filed a report .
was that an isolated incident ,
or does he have some kind of beef
going on with somebody on campus ?
unfortunately , there a quite a few people
who had issues with him .
okay , so , this web site
ranks professors based on student reviews .
now , professor thomas &apos; approval ratings were in the tank .
by far the lowest of any teacher in the whole place .
and check out some of the comments .
&quot; this guy &apos;s not a professor .
&quot; he &apos;s a dictator ,
and his class is like a prison camp . &quot; damn hell .
&quot; professor thomas makes the dude
&quot; from whiplash seem warm and fuzzy .
&quot; and he doesn &apos;t play cool jazz music &quot;
these are some of the nicer ones .
check this one out .
&quot; thomas sucks &quot; &quot;
i &apos;m into the whole brevity thing , you know .
okay , well , it &apos;s clear his students hated him .
and given he was grabbed on campus ,
we need to consider all of them as suspects , right ?
so i just got off the phone with duke .
professor thomas &apos; house was vandalized last week .
someone tossed a brick through the window
with a note attached .
that &apos;s called a sicilian love letter .
what did it say ?
said , &quot; do the world a favor and die . &quot;
oh , that sounds like that could be our guy .
maybe he fired a shot across the old professor &apos;s bow
before he got up close and personal with him .
well , the lab was able to pull a print off the note ,
but there was no match in afis .
i don &apos;t suppose we can just head down to campus
and fingerprint all of his students ?
maybe we can .
how ?
well , it seems to me that there &apos;s now an opening
for a new economics professor at osu ,
and it just so happens that one of our own
minored in business at seton hall .
how could you possibly know that ?
that &apos;s not even in my personnel file .
you think i &apos;m gonna take you on to be my partner
this whole time without doing my homework ?
wait . boss , you &apos;ve been sitting on that for six years ?
that means he &apos;s probably got something on all of us .
whatever .
especially you .
let &apos;s stay on point .
we need somebody on the inside ,
somebody to get intel and prints .
danny , you make the most sense .
no .
what do you mean , &quot; no ? &quot;
no ! i &apos;m not gonna do it .
it &apos;s ridiculous , first of all .
second of all , even if i did do it ,
uh , nobody &apos;s gonna buy me as a stuffy economics professor .
oh , no . i don &apos;t know .
oh , you don &apos;t ?
i don &apos;t know . you got a little , uh , quick temper ,
kind of curmudgeonly .
curmudgeonly .
yeah , and you have an opinion about everything .
you &apos;re the grumpiest person i know .
all right , good .
all right , so let &apos;s say that this stupid idea is
something that we can do .
maybe i can get prints , but intel ?
i &apos;m not gonna be able ...
these kids are not gonna open up to me .
he &apos;s right . they &apos;re not .
we need somebody else in there with you ,
somebody who these kids can relate to ,
who looks like &apos; em , who acts like them .
so let me get this straight .
you want me to leave this lab
to go undercover as a college student
at the biggest party school in the state ?
yes .
it was his idea , not mine .
all right .
if i &apos;m gonna sell this , though , i got to go all in .
don &apos;t do anything stupid .
马龙尼 · 埃里克
you look totally different , uncle d.
that &apos;s a great disguise . yeah ?
thank you . you , too , with the , uh ,
college idiot persona . you are a natural .
okay , so ,
we &apos;re gonna have eyes and ears on you at all times .
right . so , hypothetically speaking ,
if i were to find myself in a compromising position
with one of these coeds ,
and maintaining my cover requires me
to satisfy her sexually ,
that &apos;s cool , right ?
this has &quot; epic fail &quot; written all over it .
you know that , right ?
okay , eric ,
you need to focus on memorizing
the names and faces of these students .
okay , you &apos;re gonna have to get in with these kids ,
you know , embed yourself , and find out
who may have had it in for professor thomas .
i can foc ... holy smoke show .
check it out , uncle d.
that girl &apos;s a legit ten .
hell , if we were back in jersey , she &apos;d be a 12 .
i &apos;m gonna be real honest here , if she killed the professor ,
i wouldn &apos;t care . i &apos;d still marry her .
can i smack him ?
do me a favor , please ,
just try and act professional . that &apos;s all . okay ?
guys , chillax , all right ?
i &apos;m just getting into character .
mrs. tiffany russo .
it &apos;s got a nice ring to it though , don &apos;t it ?
oh , boy .
all right , uh , so i understand , uh ,
you &apos;ve been covering monopoly markets .
so if nobody has any questions ...
i have a question .
yes .
what happened to professor thomas ?
is he , like , not gonna come back ?
no , i @-@ i don &apos;t think he will be coming back .
awesome news .
okay .
uh , look , i need to gauge where you people are .
so there &apos;s gonna be a @-@ a pop quiz right now .
yeah , i know . it &apos;s terrible .
but the good news is ... here , look , there &apos;s good news .
when you &apos;re done with the test ,
you can go directly to your homes
or wherever it is that you choose to go .
just , uh , please hand the test to me , okay ?
yeah ? right when you finish . i &apos;ll be right there waiting .
okay ? it &apos;s gonna be fun , everybody .
how you doing ?
kamekona said you had a visitor yesterday .
then i guess he told you about my father .
you want to talk about it ?
there &apos;s not much to say .
he wants custody ?
i haven &apos;t seen him since i was eight .
he thinks &apos; cause he writes a couple of letters from prison ,
and says he &apos;s sorry that still makes him my father .
and now i got to live with this guy .
this is a court hearing . you know that , right ?
nothing &apos;s been decided yet .
i &apos;d rather be back on the streets than be with him .
no chance he &apos;s changed ?
no .
thank you , mr.tucker.
thank you , ms. reese .
thank you , ms. le @-@ her ?
ler @-@ er ?
lehrer .
‭ lehrer . that &apos;s nice . what is that , french ?
so , will you be keeping
the same office hours as professor thomas ?
&apos;cause ...
i could really use some extra help .
you know , one @-@ on @-@ one ?
right . well , look , if you have any , um ,
questions that , uh , pertain to the ...
the material , the @-@ the work stuff that we &apos;re doing ,
then you ... my door &apos;s open .
okay . totally get what you &apos;re saying .
all right .
later , blood .
dude , i may have bombed this quiz ,
but i am straight @-@ up murdering this undercover thing .
bad choice of words . but i &apos;m already piped into the scene .
i got so much stuff going on .
i got coffee with sienna ,
ultimate frisbee in the quad , study group tonight ,
kegger after that .
okay , all right . slow down , please .
don &apos;t be too eager . if you &apos;re too eager ,
it &apos;s gonna be suspicious , you understand ?
copy that .
good .
maybe i &apos;ll blow off study group ,
see if i can track down tiffany .
the , uh ... the jersey 12 ?
that &apos;s stalking . don &apos;t stalk , &apos; cause that &apos;s illegal .
hey , hey , hey . you did not see the look she gave me , all right ?
we have something real going on here .
uh @-@ huh . all right , look ,
jump street , do me a favor , all right ?
i @-@ i can &apos;t believe that i &apos;m actually gonna say this ,
but your priority needs to be that keg party tonight ,
okay ? it &apos;s a high concentration of students .
blood alcohol level is up , guard is down .
you dig ?
got it . get &apos; em plastered ,
make &apos; em spill on professor thomas .
that &apos;s right .
dean letoa is , uh , about to call an assembly for , uh ,
professor thomas &apos; students , to tell &apos; em that he has passed on .
i want you to be there , observe and report .
will do .
okay , good .
hey , by the way .
yeah .
great class .
thank you .
inspector dunn , i apologize
we weren &apos;t properly introduced at the crime scene .
no worries . you were elbow @-@ deep in human entrails . i get it .
speaking of which , i was able to assemble
what &apos;s left of your victim .
after cleaning off the remains ,
i was able to discover a single gsw to the chest .
unfortunately , i couldn &apos;t find any exit wound ,
but , based on the trajectory , i would assume
professor thomas was shot in the heart .
unfortunately , the heart was eaten .
so you &apos;re saying the pigs ...
the pigs ate the bullet ?
correct . now , thankfully , after digestion ,
we will be able to excavate the evidence .
so we have to wait for the pigs to ...
poop the slug ?
yes . and you will have to monitor them closely ,
because , given the opportunity ,
swines will consume their own excrement .
i &apos;m glad i &apos;m a vegetarian .
okay . well , i can tell you right now
that we won &apos;t be babysitting the pigs .
jerry , hey . what are you doing ?
hey , sorry , jer ,
i know it &apos;s not the most glamorous gig .
are you kidding me ?
i &apos;m searching for the magic bullet .
you guys trust me . this is real cop work .
all right , well , remember , when the bullet comes out ...
i know .
don &apos;t touch it . call csu . got it .
good luck .
what ?
nothing . it &apos;s just ...
you know the last time somebody opened a door for me ?
it was ... never .
oh , come on . not even on a date ?
no .
all right , well , i guess i was just raised to be a gentleman .
yeah . it &apos;s a good thing .
one of the things i always admired about my dad
was his sense of chivalry .
i thought that had died out with his generation .
it &apos;s nice to see i was wrong .
hey , danny . what &apos;s up ?
hey . where are you on the prints that i sent over ?
hmm , we &apos;re about halfway done .
okay , do me a favor .
uh , pull up brandon aquino .
run him next if you haven &apos;t already .
run brandon aquino right away .
eric just called .
apparently he ran out of the assembly the second he heard
that professor thomas was murdered , so ...
who is this kid ?
starting point guard for the basketball team ,
who was failing professor thomas &apos; class ,
which makes him ineligible .
well , there &apos;s a motive .
yeah , we got a match . he &apos;s our guy .
where is he now ?
he &apos;s , uh , in there with the coach .
what did you do ?
sounds pretty ugly .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about !
you need to calm down !
calm down ?
hey , hey . hey , hey , hey , hey !
both of you , shut your mouth ! hey !
brandon aquino , we need to talk to you
about the murder of professor thomas .
whoa , you got the wrong guy . coach did it .
he killed professor thomas !
you threw a brick through the professor &apos;s window .
it had a note on it with your prints all over the note .
you wanted him dead . now he &apos;s dead .
i threw the brick . i was pissed .
i worked my ass off in that class ,
and no matter what i did , it wasn &apos;t good enough .
but i wouldn &apos;t kill him .
that &apos;s a hell of an accusation to have thrown at you , coach .
why would i kill professor thomas ?
coach diggs blew up when he found out i was failing .
he based his whole team around me .
we haven &apos;t won a championship in over 30 years ,
and this season was our best shot .
he said not to worry about it
and he &apos;d take care of it .
i went to ask him to cut brandon some slack .
but he wasn &apos;t interested in having that conversation .
i bet that pissed you off .
yeah . it did .
so i talked to the board of trustees ,
made them see the big picture :
with thomas gone ,
brandon can play .
if brandon plays , the team wins .
and so does the whole school .
so you had him fired .
it was supposed to be his last semester .
so you see ?
the guy was out .
i had no reason to kill him .
i am just so broken up about it , professor jeffries .
oh . ben .
i mean , i can call you that , right ?
no .
i mean , life is just so fleeting .
you really have to make the most of every opportunity .
yeah . that &apos;s , uh ... that &apos;s true .
it &apos;s a very interesting thought .
and probably something ... all this you should discuss
with your grief counselor .
yeah , but , i mean , you seem ...
so approachable .
i &apos;m not .
you are .
that &apos;s crazy , &apos; cause i &apos;m not .
i &apos;m not approachable at all .
my friends think ...
that &apos;s ... i got to get this phone call immediately .
you don &apos;t even know who it is .
i know exactly who it is .
i @-@ i ... wait . wait . seriously ?
yeah , i &apos;m sorry . it &apos;s just , um , i got to take this .
uh ... please , come on .
okay .
sorry . i &apos;ll see you in class .
see you later , ben .
please tell me that brandon did it so i can go home .
brandon and coach diggs both alibied out .
i &apos;m sorry , buddy .
good . great . so i &apos;m gonna be a teacher for the rest of my life .
the good news is that grace will get a free education .
look , we know professor thomas was grabbed on campus .
and brandon aquino wasn &apos;t the only kid who hated him .
his killer is someone at that school . i &apos;m telling you .
oh , good . well , then i better get back to class .
go get &apos; em , professor plum .
it &apos;s jeffries . thank you .
now , let &apos;s shift gears from one cycle to another .
we &apos;ve already talked about plc ,
so we &apos;ll get back to basics ...
although the term &quot; cycle &quot; would infer a notion in the cycle before ...
recovery ... unpredictable ... fickle economic roller ...
of predictability or certainty , these fluctuations ...
now , the peak is ...
anyone has any questions . i &apos;ll be in my office .
thanks for coming in .
oh , that &apos;s very nice . thank you very much .
see you .
okay , so check this out .
i was looking to professor thomas &apos; financials
and i found something interesting .
three months ago he re @-@ mortgaged his house
to purchase a nail salon .
okay .
maybe he found out he was getting fired
and was looking for another source of income .
yeah , well , if that &apos;s the case ,
it turned out to be a great investment ,
because not only was he able to pay back the mortgage ,
he was collecting a $ 3,500 weekly salary .
that &apos;s a hell of a lot of manicures .
and get this-- our previous owner was foreclosed on ,
so our economics professor must &apos;ve been
one hell of a business genius
to turn this place around in record time .
‭ right . $ 3,500 a week for buffing and polishing ?
nobody &apos;s that smart .
all right , steve , listen to me .
i &apos;ve spoken to 48 students , 12 professors .
i even spoke to the guy
who sells poke in the middle of the courtyard .
this plan of yours is a complete disaster . it &apos;s not working .
well , maybe there &apos;s a problem with the execution .
how &apos;s e @-@ train doing ?
oh , e &apos;s fantastic .
you should see the way he plays frisbee now . it &apos;s really great .
and he &apos;s going to a keg party later tonight
and if he doesn &apos;t get completely hammered ,
maybe he &apos;ll give us some information .
good . sounds like the williams family has it all under control .
professor jeffries , great lecture .
thanks , buddy . you hear that ?
despite this ill @-@ conceived plan of yours ,
i am still making a positive difference in young people &apos;s lives .
oh , yeah , give it time , danny , i &apos;m sure by tomorrow
you &apos;ll be making their lives as miserable as you make mine .
i got to go , buddy . i &apos;ll talk to you soon .
kaili huikala ?
yeah .
i &apos;m steve mcgarrett .
been meaning to reach out to you .
heard you &apos;ve been looking out for my son .
i appreciate that .
he &apos;s a great kid .
yeah , he is .
but i &apos;m guessing you didn &apos;t come down here to tell me that .
well , you &apos;re right .
i wanted to talk to you
about nahele &apos;s well @-@ being , actually .
i know you think this custody case is the best thing for him .
but with all due respect , i think you &apos;re wrong .
i appreciate your concern , but nahele &apos;s my son .
and he doesn &apos;t want to be with you right now , kaili .
when i went away he was just a little boy .
i let him down .
i know he &apos;s mad at me for that . i don &apos;t blame him .
but i want to make things right .
i get that , but you come at him too hard .
you &apos;re gonna push him away .
and that trust is gonna take time to earn .
i already lost out on eight years with him .
that was all my fault .
i &apos;m the one who committed those robberies .
but i &apos;m a different man now .
and all i want to do is prove that to him .
that boy &apos;s all the family i got .
&quot; &apos; but it &apos;s unfair &apos; , cried fern .
&quot; the pig couldn &apos;t help being born small , could it ? &quot;
&quot; if i had been very small at birth , would you have killed me ? &quot;
i know .
it gets me every time , too .
oh , that &apos;s what you meant .
gotcha .
my pig latin isn &apos;t as good it used to be . get it ?
yeah , that was bad .
anyway , you just go ahead and defecate
and i &apos;ll just , uh , hang here and give you some privacy .
excellent work , my friend .
take that , warren commission .
how &apos;d it go with nahele &apos;s father ?
well , i mean , he &apos;s uh ...
well , he &apos;s saying all the right things .
he got himself a job .
he seems determined to turn his life around .
he wants nahele to be a part of it .
okay .
you don &apos;t sound so convinced .
when i talk to nahele , i just ...
i got this feeling he &apos;s not telling me something .
that &apos;s all . but maybe i &apos;m being overprotective .
you know ? i just want to do right by this kid .
so where are we at with kono and grover ? any , uh ...
uh , yeah , well , they checked out the nail salon ,
they said it was a ghost town .
yeah , they also spoke
to a couple other business owners in the area .
according to them , it &apos;s always quiet like that .
yeah , but the tax records , however ,
show that the place has been raking it in .
‭ okay , so clearly it &apos;s a front .
that &apos;s what we &apos;re thinking .
according to payroll , one of the professor &apos;s students
was actually listed as an employee .
kid &apos;s name is alfie tucker .
we got his schedule from the school registrar .
his last class of the day was two hours ago .
we &apos;re tracking him down now .
20 o &apos;clock on a friday night .
i think i know where he might be .
ooh , you made it !
how are you ?
you are way behind .
let me tell you something , sweet tiffany ,
nobody plays catch @-@ up better than me , huh ?
mmm . mmm , oh , yeah .
do that again . thank you .
where have you been all semester ?
nowhere .
maybe you &apos;re not looking hard enough .
so what , you just show up to class
whenever you want ?
uh ... or when i got a reason to .
pretty awful about that professor , huh ?
no . thank god he died .
whoa , that &apos;s a little harsh .
you &apos;re right . i do feel bad for the guy ,
but at least we got a shot at passing his class now .
have you seen professor jeffries ?
i &apos;m adding him to my to @-@ do list .
what , are you kidding me ? the guy &apos;s so old
he went to bon jovi &apos;s first concert back in &apos; 84 .
okay , how would you even know that ?
facebook @-@ stalked him .
go for e.
hey , can you talk ?
oh , yeah , ma .
she @-@ she worries about me .
okay , what &apos;s up ?
i &apos;m sending you a photo right now .
let me know you got it .
got it .
good . you recognize that kid ?
sure , yeah , that &apos;s one buck tuck .
what does that mean ? what &apos;s one buck tuck ?
well , his last name &apos;s tucker . he sells one blunt
for one dollar during happy hour , ergo one buck tuck .
he &apos;s the pot dealer on campus .
why , you think this is our guy ?
maybe . uh , apparently he and thomas were partners ,
uh , and they had a @-@ a nail salon that
they were using as a front to launder money .
now i have an idea where the money was coming from .
so maybe the professor &apos;s murder didn &apos;t have to do
with him being a hard @-@ ass to his students ?
maybe not . maybe this was just a disagreement between partners .
right .
if you &apos;re looking for tuck , he &apos;s not here .
just come back for your medicinal needs later .
i heard him say to come in right in .
i heard him say it , too .
where is he ?
i don &apos;t know . i just got back and he wasn &apos;t here .
i &apos;m gonna search all his stuff now .
you got a problem with that ?
no .
uh , go right ahead , i , actually , uh , i have to go study .
you got to study ?
anxious little dude .
ah , college dorm life ,
where personal hygiene
and ramen noodles go to die .
look at that .
an old , worn @-@ out poster stuck to the ceiling .
that &apos;s not weird .
got 20 pounds of weed up here .
that &apos;s , that &apos;s a lot of smoke .
yeah , there &apos;s something else , too
oh , grow lamp .
looks like alfie and the professor weren &apos;t just selling .
you know , if there really is 20 pounds of weed up there ,
you know how many plants that would take ?
yeah .
like a hundred .
and a big space .
a lot of power . that &apos;s well @-@ hidden , right ?
yeah .
i think i know where the place is .
alfie , alfie , alfie ! don &apos;t do it .
close the lighter .
put the lighter back in your pocket .
turn around .
get on your knees , put your hands behind your head .
hands behind your head .
professor jeffries ?
no , i am detective williams .
so you &apos;re not really a teacher ?
no , i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m not really a teacher .
i definitely was not this stupid when i was in college .
yeah , don &apos;t do drugs , just got a new mascot .
hey , that weed wasn &apos;t mine .
i was just burning it for a friend .
okay , first of all , i don &apos;t believe that .
but more importantly , we do not care about the weed , okay ?
you don &apos;t ?
no .
we don &apos;t . we just want to know
why is it that you killed your partner .
what ? !
you mean professor thomas ?
no way . i had nothing to do with that .
well , then why were you trying to burn your crop ?
because i didn &apos;t want to be next .
next for what ? what do you mean ?
look ... all i wanted to do was sell to my friends .
it was never really about money with me .
but i was an idiot .
did a handoff in the parking lot one day
and professor thomas saw me .
i was pretty sure he was gonna have me expelled .
but he had this big idea .
he said i wasn &apos;t taking advantage
of my position in the marketplace ,
that he could help me double my cash flow .
so what , he was , uh , he was , like , your advisor ?
more like business partner .
professor thomas knew he was getting fired .
he said he never wanted to teach again ,
that this could be his retirement .
so he helped me expand the business .
and that didn &apos;t go over so well with some of our competitors .
okay , if you are saying that one of them
potentially killed him , we need a name .
not happening .
i &apos;m not gonna end up like professor thomas .
you think burning your inventory &apos;s
gonna prove you &apos;re out of the game ?
because the people we &apos;re talking about ,
they &apos;re gonna make sure you never grow anything ever again .
they &apos;re gonna kill you .
if i give you a name ...
you have to protect me .
sit down ! sit down !
have a seat !
i never met no professor thomas .
or this alfie . what kind of name is that , anyways ?
sounds like a couple of haoles .
yeah , it was a couple of haoles .
now there &apos;s only one haole ,
&apos;cause you killed the other one .
why would i do that ?
because they started growing their own product ,
and it was your territory--
you couldn &apos;t have that , right ?
grow ? you talkin &apos; pakalolo ?
braddah , kush is about to be legal .
why waste time with that when this whole island &apos;s a garden ?
‭ how &apos;d it go in there ?
he denied all knowledge of alfie and the professor .
his crew said the same thing .
hpd did a sweep of their hang .
found a few weapons , but no drugs .
what ?
i believe him .
i &apos;m just saying , it &apos;s my gut-- i don &apos;t think
he had anything to do with this murder .
hey , so that was chin .
ballistics came back on the slug that jerry recovered .
got a hit back to a beretta nine @-@ millimeter
registered to the honolulu firearms &amp; range on queen .
let &apos;s go .
there &apos;s no way . it &apos;s been here the whole time .
oh , it has , has it ?
yes .
we &apos;re gonna need to see a record of anybody
who has used it in the last 48 hours .
i &apos;ll go print you a list right now .
great . off you go . thanks .
actually , we &apos;re gonna hang on to that for a minute .
hey , uh , steve .
anybody look familiar up there ?
you mean professor thomas ?
no way . i had nothing to do with that .
all right . so this is obviously you right there , you see ?
and then that little nubby thing right there ,
that is a nine @-@ millimeter beretta .
so what ?
so what ?
i shoot that gun at the range all the time .
took it home by accident ;
i returned it the next morning .
that doesn &apos;t prove i killed the professor .
actually , alfie , you &apos;re wrong .
ballistics proves that
that gun was the gun that killed the professor .
and t.o.d.-- that &apos;s &quot; time of death &quot; --
matches exactly the window
where you accidentally borrowed it .
i like how you used the gun range as a library .
that &apos;s nice-- you take the murder weapon out ,
you return it the next day . that &apos;s good .
you know , i seem to remember you saying
this was never about the money .
my guess is , once you tasted some real cash ...
you changed your view on that , right ?
all of a sudden the idea of splitting
the take 50 @-@ 50 wasn &apos;t so appealing .
you &apos;re a smart kid , alfie .
i see what the professor saw in you ,
but you made a mistake--
you left out one small detail .
pigs can &apos;t digest metal .
or , in this case , lead bullets .
what do you mean alfie confessed ?
it means that
he , uh , admitted to it , he said , &quot; i did it , &quot; okay ?
he confessed .
and that &apos;s it ? i mean , you believe him ?
he &apos;s lied to you about everything
and now you trust him ?
okay , listen ,
i apologize , but the fun is over , okay ?
the case is closed . that &apos;s that .
no , uncle d , you &apos;re killing me !
call me uncle d one more time and see what happens , okay ?
sorry . i &apos;m an idiot .
yes , you @-@ you are an idiot .
but , um ...
you did a ... you did a very good job .
i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m proud of you , okay ?
wow . compliment ? thanks .
don &apos;t get used to it .
get your ass back to the crime lab , all right ?
hey , you !
why the long face ?
tiff , i got to tell you something .
what are you still doing here ?
uh , i was just working on my daily report .
sfpd brass wants to make sure i &apos;m actually working here
and not lounging at the beach or taking surf lessons .
well , you know , you might be more comfortable in an office .
you &apos;re welcome to use mine if you &apos;d like .
are you sure ? i mean , you already opened the door for me today--
that &apos;s a lot for a girl like me to take in .
mm @-@ hmm , very funny .
make yourself at home .
mahalo .
what ? did i say it wrong ?
no , you nailed it .
i really appreciate this .
you &apos;re welcome .
good night , abby .
good night , chin .
i &apos;ve gone over mr. huikala &apos;s testimony ,
as well as the social worker &apos;s evaluation .
i also have affidavits here
from mr. huikala &apos;s employer and parole officer .
at this point i feel i have enough information
to render a decision .
the state of hawaii prides itself in reconnecting families ,
and after careful consideration ,
i believe that is what we should do here today .
this court feels that it is in nahele &apos;s best interest
to be reunited with his father .
the petition for custody is hereby granted .
i thought i might find you here .
look , nahele ,
i know things didn &apos;t go down the way you wanted them to , but ...
i @-@ i don &apos;t care what ...
i don &apos;t care what that judge said .
they can &apos;t make me live with him .
actually , they can .
there &apos;s something you &apos;re not telling me , isn &apos;t there ?
and i want to help you ,
but if you don &apos;t let me in , i can &apos;t .
look at me .
i will always protect you , all right ?
all right ?
keiki , i promised shave ice .
just need to make a pit stop first . okay ?
stay in the car , nahele .
read one of your comic books , all right ?
we &apos;ll be back soon .
keiki , your seat belt .
come on , let &apos;s go get that shave ice .
call duke .
get him over to nahele &apos;s father &apos;s place .
tell him i &apos;ll meet him .
