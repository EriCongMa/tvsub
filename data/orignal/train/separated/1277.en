Maura, sweetheart.
Good morning, Angela.
How you doing?
Oh, I don't know.
I don't know.
Go ahead, Maura. Let it out.
I'll get us some coffee.
A tragic accident like that...
you never really see it coming.
I am worried about Jane.
Her and Barry were so close, and...
well, with the pregnancy and all those hormones --
Jane doesn't know that you know
and she hasn't told anyone else, so you need to just --
I know. Keep my trap shut. I will.
Doesn't mean that a mother can't worry.
She's always been so good about sympathizing with others.
But when it comes to her own feelings,
she bottles everything up.
She needs to let it out.
So do you.
You need a good cry, a big cry.
We will. In time.
Dabda.
Gesundheit?
The stages of grief.
Denial, anger, bargaining,
depression, acceptance.
It's from Elisabeth Kubler-Ross' seminal work
in the mid-20th century.
Though current research shows that yearning
is actually a more accurate expression of the final --
Okay. That all sounds great.
When's the crying start?
Hey. Good morning, ma.
Hi, honey.
Thanks for letting me stay over last night.
No problem. I didn't want to be alone, either.
Where you going?
To the station.
Don't you think it would be better
to stay home and feel your feelings?
Ma, he loved his work.
He wouldn't want me to just curl up and stop doing mine.
I don't think that's what your mom's suggesting.
Maybe -- maybe you can sit down, have a cup of coffee?
Real coffee.
I can make us all some breakfast.
I'll take the coffee.
Thanks.
See you later.
Wasn't that your vase?
Yep.
Denial.
Check.
Good morning.
What are you doing here?
I have dealt with hundreds of homicides
and the grieving relatives that go with them.
I can deal with this.
Really?
Because you had coffee in your pencil holder.
It's not a pencil holder. Maura was messing with me.
Go home.
No.
Maybe I wasn't clear. I'm ordering you to go home.
You're ordering me?
Yes.
We don't have a case we're working on.
I'm the sergeant detective of this squad.
And I have the authority to send you home if I think you're not --
If you think that I am gonna let you pull rank on me,
It's not -- - Jane?
Mrs. Frost.
I'm sorry to interrupt.
I... I just didn't know where else to go.
I'm so sorry.
And then the funeral director
started asking me all these questions
Like did I want a viewing,
should Barry wear his uniform,
what kind of music should they play.
And I realized... I don't know.
How could you?
A couple of years ago, Barry sat me down
and had me tell him what I wanted at my service.
It never dawned on me to ask about his.
He was just so young.
Would you like us to take care of the service for you?
I couldn't ask you to do that.
You didn't ask. I volunteered.
Even his father can't get here.
H-he's on a ship doing a support mission
in the middle of the Pacific.
So...it would mean so much if you could help.
We'd be honored.
And of course we'll, uh, keep you in the loop
on all the preparations.
Nobody knew my son better than you all did,
so whatever you decide, I know it will be perfect.
Just what Barry would have wanted.
Well, now you got a reason to go home.
Vince, come on.
Please don't pull rank on me now, okay?
I know your heart is in the right...
Gun!
Put your weapon down.
Put it down.
Help me.
We'll help you as soon as you give us that gun.
What's your name?
I-I don't know.
Okay. What kind of help do you need?
I killed someone.
Who?
I don't know that, either.
Well, I guess we got a case now.
How did you get here?
I, um...I walked by
the deli, dry cleaner,
and then I saw a policeman walk in here,
so I-I followed him.
How about before that?
I-I don't know.
What city are we in?
Boston.
What's your favorite baseball team?
Red sox.
You said you killed someone.
Did that happen in the day or the night?
I-I don't -- I don't know.
We just need it high enough
so I can remove her clothes in private.
That was very considerate.
I'd hate to have to testify on why we undressed her
in front of the entire Boston police force.
Doctor?
Uh, after we've collected the clothing,
take the tarp to evidence and make sure
we process everything that fell off.
Amanda's gonna remove your clothes and your shoes.
And we have scrubs and shoes for you to put on.
If you're cold, I can give you a reflective blanket.
O-okay.
I'm not going home.
Planning a funeral takes a lot of time.
She might have committed a murder or not.
He would have wanted me to stay on the job
and figure out what happened.
Have you noticed that you won't say his name?
Barry Frost.
There. You happy, Dr. Freud?
Well, Freud actually believed that
everything was related to some repressed sexual desire.
I do not think that is the reason
that you will not say Detective Frost's name.
I have to figure out who she is. I will talk to you later.
Probably shouldn't have said that.
All his years on the force,
he's entitled to the pomp and circumstance,
even if he didn't die in the line of duty.
Hey. I heard about Frost.
It's a real shame. He was a good man.
Yeah. He was.
Thanks.
Look, I know everybody means well,
but that's gonna be real tough to do 200 times today.
And, yes, of course he deserves it.
Frost deserves a cop's funeral.
But if we go full pageant, then it becomes a photo op.
If it becomes a photo op, then everyone shows up --
The cardinal, the mayor.
Frost hated the mayor.
He wrote in Bill "Spaceman" Lee
instead of voting for him.
Exactly.
Let's keep what Frost liked and ditch what he hated.
So no to the mayor and...
Yes to bagpipes.
How did he feel about "Danny Boy"?
Yes to bagpipes, no to "Danny Boy."
You be in charge of the music.
I don't know anything about music.
You want to do the eulogy?
You're good with music.
Hey, I volunteered for pictures.
Oh, I'm no good at pictures, either.
Well, why don't you just let me know
when you decide what you're least bad at?
Hey, Jane.
Your woman's fingerprints are a bust.
She wasn't in the database.
But her gun was recently fired.
Any dead bodies lying in the street
that are in need of a suspect to go with them?
Wouldn't that be convenient?
Well, missing-persons' reports matching her description?
No.
Uninvestigated gunshots
anywhere in the Greater Boston area?
Oh, come on.
We all know she's faking amnesia to set up
a mental-incapacitation defense for a murder trial.
Probably.
But she was covered in blood and had no visible injuries.
I mean, based on volume alone, someone is dead
or going to be soon if we don't find them.
No shots. At least not that shot alert picked up.
Okay. Let's get her picture to all roll calls,
see if we can track her in the homeland security cameras.
You all know Roger Wise,
the department grief counselor.
I was very sorry to hear about detective Frost.
I'm here to help any way I can.
So, I can't force any of you to talk to Roger
about this tragic auto accident.
But I can force you to sit with him for 30 minutes,
talk about anything you like.
So, who's first?
I-I got to distribute the photo.
I got to check out the cameras.
I'll, uh...
Thanks for volunteering, detective.
Takes a strong man to open up about his feelings.
Dr. Maura Isles initiating the examination of...
I-I don't want to call you "Jane Doe"
Because that's what I call the other women
who end up on this table who are...
less alive than you.
So, based on the flounce hem of your skirt
and the elasticity of your skin,
I'd say you're in your mid-20s.
The most popular baby name 25 years ago was Jessica.
Okay.
Maura Isles initiating the examination
of Jessica Doe, female caucasian.
Approximate age is 25.
I'm sorry to be talking as if you weren't here.
It's okay.
You're trying to help me, right?
Well, I'm...
I'm trying to find out what happened to you.
I'm going to take scrapings to see if there's
any tissues underneath your fingernails.
So, you like the Red Sox?
Do you have a favorite player?
Dustin Pedroia.
Most defensive runs saved at his position over the last three years.
He's got a nice smile.
Yes, he does.
When I was at BCU,
my roommate took me to a game,
and it was the best hot dog I ever had.
It's the mustard.
I didn't know that.
Been to a game recently?
I don't know.
It's okay.
I am going to floss your teeth.
If you could just open your mouth for me, please.
I wonder what's in that mustard.
Camera tracks her down Tremont to Columbus.
Then she heads onto the bike path, southwest corridor,
and that's it 'cause the cameras stop.
Okay. Well, I got a hit on the gun registration.
The owner reported it stolen three years ago
and doesn't know our woman.
I finished my live autopsy.
Well, technically it can't be an autopsy because that is,
by definition, an examination of a body after death.
Although I could be using the word in the spirit of autopsia,
from the Greek, meaning "to see with one's own eyes."
Anyway. Jessica...
Who's Jessica?
The woman from the lobby.
No, Korsak. Maura's named her.
Now we'll never be able to give her back.
The blood on her clothes was from a single subject,
likely male, type A-negative.
Okay. Probably caucasian.
In Boston, yes.
And in Honolulu?
Well, over a 60% chance that the subject would be Polynesian.
Do you make this stuff up 'cause you know we can't check it?
Yes.
No. I'm not that fanciful.
Jessica also had traces of methylenedioxy on her skirt.
Perfect,
that narrows our search down to 2,000 ecstasy dealers
and about a bajillion ecstasy users.
I also have a possible explanation for her amnesia.
She might be in a dissociative fugue state.
Is that Greek for "faking it?"
'Cause that's what we think right now.
A fugue state is a very rare condition that occurs
when someone experiences a trauma so severe
that they block parts of their consciousness related to it.
A bad thing happens and they forget
anything that might remind them of the bad thing.
Yes.
Jessica doesn't remember who she is
because it's directly connected to the traumatic event.
But she remembers that she likes the Red Sox
because it's not.
There's my vase.
Okay, assuming
we thought this was real... which we do not...
how do we get her to snap out of it?
I would suggest taking her to familiar places
and seeing if anything triggers any memories.
Great plan, but because of her probably fake amnesia,
we don't know anything about her.
Well, she did have a FirstPark ticket in her pocket
and candy-coated fennel seed in her teeth.
Those are digestives often found in Indian restaurants.
So FirstPark garages near Indian restaurants.
Does the phrase "Wild goose chase" mean anything to you?
Yes, but...
at least we get to try delicious digestives
all over the city.
Bye, Maura. Bye, Jane.
All right. How about that? It's called taste of tandoor.
No.
How many stops do we have left?
Two. The next restaurant is on Emerson.
FirstPark Garage is around the corner.
Oh. What do we do when those turn up nothing?
Call dispatch, have them put her picture up on the website.
Nothing? None of this looks familiar to you?
No.
I'm sorry.
Y-you had to
have been to at least one of these places.
I mean, what about Abe & Louie's?
Everybody in Boston's eaten there.
No. Over there. Across the street.
Wait. Korsak, stop.
Stop! Stop the car!
Oh, my gosh! Look out for that car!
What?! Are you crazy?!
Thanks.
I feel so stupid.
No need.
It just seemed so real.
I mean, I could have sworn he was standing right there.
At the beginning of my career,
I was first on the scene at an auto accident.
Older guy ran into a telephone pole.
The M.E. at the time thought he might have
had a heart attack and died at the wheel.
And the man had a smile on his face
Like he died without a care in the world.
For months after that,
I saw the guy all over Boston --
sitting on a park bench, once at Fenway Park.
Did that really happen
or are you just telling me that to make me feel better?
I swear to god. The mind does funny things.
Do you think Frost made us stop?
Uh, I don't believe in that stuff. Do you?
No, but I think if I were dead
and you were here with Frost,
he might have believed it.
I mean, if she's running a con,
does she actually think she's gonna get away with it?
I've said it before.
Criminals are generally very, very stupid.
Okay, listen.
I want to believe that what you're saying is real --
that you don't remember who you are, all right?
And most days, I wouldn't be able to do that.
But today I'm gonna try, okay?
But if you don't remember something...
...I can't help you.
Whoa. Whoa, whoa. What? D-do you have children?
I-I don't think so.
Okay. Uh, does it have something to do with kids?
Are you a teacher?
Yes!
Okay. Okay.
Maybe he's helping us solve this after all.
Any luck?
It would help if teachers in Massachusetts
had fingerprints on file. I'll hop in my time machine
and go back and let the union know your preference.
W-without a name, I'm having to call up individual schools.
And I'm making a list of absent teachers.
And I'm pulling up footage from schools nearby
to see if she wandered out of one of them.
It's gonna take a while to finish it all.
I get it. Fingerprints on file would be a lot easier.
Where's Jane?
It was a long day. I sent her home.
And she listened?
I suppose it's possible she's sitting downstairs in the lobby.
How's it coming with the music for the funeral?
Oh, I've eliminated many, many choices.
So nowhere.
Basically.
Lunch sucked today.
What did you do?
I sat at my desk and...
wondered where Frost would have wanted to go.
What did you decide?
I -- I wasn't hungry.
Oh, hell.
I'm headed home.
Well, you're welcome to spend the night again if you'd like.
No, thanks. I'd rather be alone.
No offense.
None taken. How are you holding up?
I'm tired.
Well, the development of the placenta
is one of the most energetically intense parts
of the first trimester -- that could be the reason.
Or it could be that one of my best friends just died.
Yes. That could be it, too.
I saw him on the street today.
I'm sorry.
I mean, I didn't.
I thought I saw him on the street today.
That's called an anomalous experience.
It's -- it's perfectly normal.
As is crying.
How do you know I haven't cried yet?
Because you would have said, "I had a good cry
and it didn't help," or something like that.
How are you doing?
I think I've moved through denial and anger.
I'm ready to move into bargaining
and I'll have a good cry when I get to depression.
Can't plan a cry, Maura.
I'm not planning it.
I'm just narrowing down the window of its arrival.
And it occurred to me today that --
that we need to talk about our last wishes.
No, we don't.
I want to be buried at sea.
No. I hate boats.
And I'd have to go to city hall
and get all kinds of permits.
Uh, no. Just pick something more landlocked.
Jane, I want to return
to the primordial soup that spawned us all.
But nothing fancy --
A small group of friends and family, a cello.
We're on a boat, Maura.
And a cello is officially fancy.
Well, there would only be one.
And it should play Bach's suite in "G" Major.
And then everyone can toast me with a nice bottle of champagne
before you throw me overboard.
So, what do you want?
I want to die one day before you
so I don't have to go out on a boat.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Hey, ma. What are you doing here?
Making dinner.
I really appreciate it,
but, uh, I'm not that hungry.
Then you'll eat just a little bit.
I just want to go to bed, ma.
You got to eat, Jane. Even if you're sad.
Come on.
Why are you still here?
For Jane.
Yeah, I figured the more progress we make,
the less she'll have to worry about the case.
What about you?
Same thing.
Come on! Please?
Okay, well, t-the next time you ask me for a favor...
I'll...probably help you out because I'm a decent guy.
But I will not be nice about it!
What's going on?
Well, we didn't get anywhere with the local teachers' unions.
And then it dawns on me.
Maybe our woman doesn't work in the public school.
So I called a bunch of private schools near Indian restaurants.
You know who she is?
Lily Greene.
Uh, she teaches at Red Tree preschool.
Only I can't find a judge to sign a search warrant.
I walked in at the right moment.
That just happens to be my specialty.
Good night.
Have a good shift, Todd.
Oh, you have a nice evening, too.
Uh, Dr. Isles?
I-I heard about detective Frost.
I'm sorry. I know the two of you were close.
Thank you, Todd.
He was a nice guy -- a-a really nice guy.
Yes. He was.
Good morning.
Shh!
What?
Oh. What is she doing here?
Watching me.
Before we go to the station,
can we stop and get some breakfast?
We're not going to the station.
We're going to Lily Greene's apartment.
Oh. I'm so hungry. Who's Lily Greene?
You know, Miss "I have blood all over me and I don't know who I am."
So you found out who she is. That's great.
What did she say when you told her?
Well, we haven't told her yet.
I mean, we've got one shot at a confession.
So if we open the door to her apartment
and there's a dead body in there,
it kind of makes it a little difficult
for her to keep faking amnesia --
if that's what she's doing.
Okay, so crime scene, then breakfast.
Why didn't you eat a muffin before you left the house?
There's no nutrition in a muffin.
There's no nutrition in gum.
Well, I like Juicy Fruit.
Clear.
Clear.
Can I come in now?
Yeah.
Just seems that we're one body short of an actual crime scene.
Well, there's been a crime.
Just not one requiring an autopsy.
It's a very thorough search.
Yeah, which begs the question, what were they looking for?
Found some money wrappers. About $2,000 worth.
I can fast-track them for drug residue.
Looks like there's a Mr. Lily Greene.
I pulled up her cellphone records
as soon as we got the warrant.
She made a lot of calls to a guy named Toby Warren.
Okay. Let's get a warrant out for him, too.
Thanks.
Barista gave me the usual.
I didn't have the heart to give it back.
What are you doing?
The part of the job that Frost would normally do
and a lot slower than he would normally do it.
So far, Lily Greene seems like a stand-up citizen.
There's not even a parking ticket.
And all I got on Toby Warren is that he's been
collecting unemployment for the past 18 months.
Maybe she got tired of supporting him.
He trashed the apartment
looking for extra money to soften his landing.
She tracked him down, ended the relationship.
I feel sorry for Kiki if this is how
you think you should end a relationship.
I'm not dating Kiki. She's my life coach.
How about I take over... that
and you go get some fresh air?
I can keep hitting the button.
That's probably a good idea.
My condolences.
How are you doing?
If I get up at the funeral and just say nothing,
will you nod your head
like I'm doing something deep and meaningful?
I absolutely will.
Did you find anything at Toby Warren's apartment?
Not Toby Warren, if that's what you mean.
You have a "but" To go along with that unhelpful information?
His cellphone's been pinging off the same tower for 24 hours.
I had his service provider turn on his GPS.
Is that your way of telling me to get off my ass?
Come on.
We got one bullet embedded in the wood here.
Hey, Frankie. Our gun may have been discharged twice.
Let's see if we can find that other bullet.
Will do.
Thanks.
Based on this wound and that bullet,
he was kneeling when he died.
It's an execution.
So, the bullet entered in his parietal bone
right above the lambdoid suture
and it exited through the right common carotid artery.
In order for her to be covered in arterial spray
on that part of her clothes...
She'd had to have been kneeling
right next to him when he was shot.
That's certainly something I'd want to forget.
But to create that angle and this entry wound,
the bullet fired at at least
15 degrees from perpendicular
and at a distance of greater than 18 inches.
Mm-hmm, so that means she would have to shoot across his body.
That can't be done.
No. Not unless her arms are four feet long.
So, either she's elastic girl
or Lily Greene didn't kill Toby Warren.
Well, I'm gonna go out on a limb
and eliminate your elastigirl theory.
Hey, Doc? I got a round blood drop on the floor here.
And no way that's splatter from Toby Warren, right?
That definitely didn't come from Toby's wounds.
I don't know where the second bullet is,
but it looks like it hit someone.
Well, what if the tissue that you found under Lily's fingernails
were from her fighting the killer?
It could be that's how she ended up with the gun.
Jane, this one's smeared.
Looks like they stepped in it.
Judging from the stride, looks like they were running.
Okay. So...someone shoots Toby.
Lily ends up with the gun, shoots that person,
and he or she runs away.
Those are the facts as we currently know them.
Just because Lily didn't shoot toby
doesn't mean she wasn't involved in whatever got him shot.
Is that your gut?
No.
No, my gut says that whoever ran away
is our killer and that Lily Greene is
a completely innocent schoolteacher
who just had the worst night of her life.
Would you like a cup of coffee?
It won't taste very good, but it'll be warm.
No, thank you. Did you find out who I am?
We did. Your name is Lily Greene.
Um, you're a preschool teacher.
Does any of that sound familiar?
Not really.
Okay.
We think we have an idea of what happened to you.
You do?
Lily...
Do you recognize this man?
No, I s-swear I'll make this right.
If you just give me a chance. I promise.
I'll do anything. It won't happen again.
I didn't think -- I mean, I didn't know.
No. No, no, no. No.
Okay. I-I know this is hard.
I don't want to talk anymore.
Lily...you're safe.
Whatever happened, you're safe now.
And pretending that it didn't happen --
It's not gonna change anything.
Please!
Don't. I swear I'll fix this.
I can. If you just give me a chance, I promise.
Toby.
I'm so sorry, sweetie. He's dead.
Tell me what you remember.
No, he was a good man.
I think he just lost his way, you know?
I do.
I do. What happened?
A couple nights ago, toby told me
that in college he used to sell drugs
and that he started again when he lost his job.
He needed to pay his bills so he took some money.
And the man he was dealing for found out,
said he had to give it back.
Toby told me he was in trouble.
I lent him everything I had.
It wasn't all he owed, but we thought,
you know, if we just showed good faith...
but... it didn't matter.
We'll make him pay for this, Lily. Just help me find him.
His name is Kyle.
That's all I know.
That's enough.
We'll find him. I promise.
Hi.
Did you pick out music for the funeral yet?
I got it narrowed down to about 20 choices.
Which is only slightly better than no choices.
Where are you with the pictures?
Done.
Did you know that he had a wall full of albums?
Guy loved music. Makes sense he'd have a lot of CDs.
Not CDs.
Vinyl.
It was on the turntable.
It's probably the last thing he listened to
before he left on vacation.
Thought it might help you out.
Detective Frost had good taste.
And just like that,
I've narrowed my choices down to one.
Thanks, Frankie.
Frankie, you sure this is a solid lead?
Everybody going in and out of this place
looks more moonshine than ecstasy.
The drugs guys don't know Kyle, but they've heard his name
and they say this is where
most of the ecstasy in Boston passes through.
Why haven't they moved on it yet?
Oh, the usual reason.
Waiting for bigger fish to swim by.
Are you searching through my car?
No.
Was he this annoying as a kid?
So much more so.
I can hear you!
Are you ready?
You mean the funeral?
My mom took the food because she said
she knew what Frost would want.
Maura took the flowers 'cause she said
none of us knew anything about flowers.
You say you're good with the music.
His mom got the minister. I --
I got nothing.
Every time I think about the eulogy, I just...
All I picture is Frost laughing at me.
It -- it --
It really messes with my concentration, you know?
It... maybe you just need to have a good cry, loosen yourself up.
I really wish that all of you --
Is that him?
Yep.
Frankie, that's our guy.
So we can't take him out until we're away from here.
Yeah, we know. And you make sure you put
Korsak's candy back in its hiding place.
I didn't find any candy.
I don't have candy.
Let me see your hands!
Damn.
Stop!
Freeze!
Look at that.
I bet that matches the skin we found
under Lily Greene's fingernails.
Congratulations, Kyle.
You're under arrest for the murder of Toby Warren.
The front desk said that
your father was down here waiting for you.
Dad.
Wait. Detective Rizzoli.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
You know, if you hadn't worked so hard,
I would have never remembered.
I'm very sorry for your loss.
I'm very sorry for yours.
We shouldn't be here today.
Barry Frost was too young
and too good for us to be here today.
But yet, here we are.
I've been given the incredible honor
of talking about how much we all loved Barry.
And I could say "a lot" and go sit down,
but it wouldn't do him justice.
Barry was...
...so many things to so many people.
...A son...
...A cop...
...A friend.
I met Barry when he joined homicide.
And he was so nervous because
parts of the job didn't really agree with him,
but he didn't let that stand in his way.
He just wanted to be the best cop that he could be.
He wanted to work harder, be smarter,
try new things, and push himself.
And I admired
the passion that he brought to his work.
I will miss him as my partner.
And I will -- and I will miss him as my friend.
But as I was preparing this eulogy,
I realized that I didn't want to
just think about what we've lost.
I wanted to find something that we could hold on to.
So I started thinking about Barry
and -- and what I really loved about him.
And -- and one idea kept coming to mind.
I really loved how he made me laugh.
And I will miss that infectious smile
and the joy that he brought to every day.
So, in this moment when it feels like there is none,
here is the good news.
Death may have taken Barry,
but it can't take our memories of him.
Those wonderful and perfect
and beautiful memories.
Those, thank God, are ours to keep.
Maura, I'm gonna be okay.
Yes.
No, no. I'm -- really, I'm going right to bed.
