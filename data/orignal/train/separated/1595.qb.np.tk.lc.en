and now all i feel is worried
about everything , including my marriage .
so you can &apos;t go on the tour .
but i want to go to idyllwild , if i can get in .
i &apos;m withdrawing my suit for custody .
we can adopt you right away .
we kissed . and now we &apos;re like ...
more than friends ?
wyatt , please don &apos;t tell me
you &apos;re acting like this because we broke up .
what the hell do you care ?
you should be with your family , ana .
so should your child .
i think ana wants to keep the baby .
but i think the only reason she isn &apos;t is because of you .
have you thought about keeping the baby ?
i think you should .
are you okay ?
oh , i think the baby is coming .
one recorded fatality .
requesting medical back up .
officer adams foster , i &apos;m right near there ,
i &apos;m on my way .
you okay ?
mm @-@ hmm .
just a bad dream .
yeah ?
go back to sleep .
i miss jesus .
i miss him too .
you think it &apos;s too early to call him ?
no .
he might think it &apos;s too early ,
but i don &apos;t .
hi , love . how are you ?
how &apos;s flintwood treating you ?
let me talk to him .
hold on .
okay , hold on , hold on . mama wants to say hi .
really , woman ?
hey , bubba . so how &apos;s the first week been ?
mama &apos;s talking to your brother .
hey , jesus ,
where are those headphones that you borrowed before you left ?
well , you &apos;re gonna have to mail them back .
are you serious ? you get a padded envelope
and then you just write our address on it .
you do know our address , right ?
and then you stamp it and then you just drop it in the mail .
god , i seriously wonder how you even function sometimes .
mariana , be nice .
what ? he took my good headphones .
i think you &apos;ll survive .
morning .
hey , are you excited about the first day ?
uh , yeah , if i ever get there .
i just looked online and there &apos;s a freaking traffic jam on the 5 .
i wish i didn &apos;t have to commute .
well , we wish you had told us you wanted to go
before the dorms got full . can &apos;t have everything .
brandon , did you get the oil checked
in the car , like we asked you to yesterday ?
yes , it &apos;s fine .
okay , drive safe .
promise .
we &apos;re so proud of you ,
playing piano again .
playing piano at the best music school in the country .
okay , okay , i gotta go , or i &apos;m gonna be late .
okay , drive safe .
yes , you said that .
we can &apos;t live in fear , okay ?
oh , first day of summer school .
who &apos;s excited ?
i am .
okay , look , i have to go .
i have to get to ana &apos;s .
she &apos;s not great , but she &apos;s getting better .
look , i really have to go , jesus .
i keep forgetting to tell you
that your independent study at the drop @-@ in center
has been approved by the teacher board .
oh , good .
so just think ,
you get that done , you pass history
and you will be all caught up
and you can graduate on time , with your class .
it &apos;s almost like i &apos;m a normal teenager .
normal is overrated .
you know what i mean .
yes , so now you just have to decide ...
what to write my paper on , i know .
hey , look , callie wants to talk to you .
talk to him .
hey , dude . how &apos;s it going ?
okay , i have to get to victor and elena &apos;s .
i love you guys .
love you too .
awesome . yeah .
you think we made a mistake , letting her play nursemaid and all ?
i don &apos;t think we really had a choice .
mariana let me in . you ready ?
yeah . we &apos;re gonna go
talk to the man who owns the truck .
okay , well , didn &apos;t the detectives do that already ?
yeah , but we just ...
stef , can i talk to you for a second ?
how &apos;s that going ?
oh , yeah ?
do you really think you should be investigating this ?
i mean , you &apos;re awfully close to it , you know ?
do you not want to catch this guy , honey .
you know , this person that pulled a hit @-@ and @-@ run
on our kids ? they could have died .
of course i want him caught , honey ,
but that &apos;s not what i &apos;m talking about .
do you not understand
why people run from the scene of an accident ?
it &apos;s because they &apos;re high or they &apos;re drunk
or they are wanted for another crime already .
this could happen to someone else ,
another family . is that okay with you ?
no , of course it &apos;s not okay .
okay , well , it &apos;s been three weeks since this has happened
and we &apos;ve got nothing .
the case is gonna be closed if something doesn &apos;t break soon .
okay .
okay .
yeah .
mike .
yeah .
nice .
不要喝咖啡了 喝点茶
yeah , sure .
you have to come back for my adoption .
i don &apos;t know . a few weeks . maybe , like , a month .
promise ?
okay . all right , bye .
that is , without a doubt ,
the longest conversation we &apos;ve ever had .
okay , i gotta go .
i &apos;m meeting connor before class .
oh , hey , have you and connor decided
what you &apos;re gonna do at school ?
are you gonna tell people or ...
um , i don &apos;t know .
we haven &apos;t really talked about it .
well , don &apos;t you think you should , bub-- talk about it ?
you know , whatever you decide , we &apos;ve got your back , right ?
i don &apos;t know . what do you think ?
i mean , i already told my dad .
and he &apos;s , like , the scariest person for me , so ...
i don &apos;t think we should .
really ?
why not ?
it &apos;s just
it &apos;s nobody &apos;s business , you know ?
brother man , brother man , you got some change ?
got a nice jacket .
excuse me , miss , you got some change ?
you got any change ?
no .
okay , princess , thanks .
i &apos;m sorry to bother you . you go on back to your privileged life .
you don &apos;t know me , okay ? you don &apos;t know anything about me .
oh , you want to bet ?
yeah .
hey , get out of here . you , leave that girl alone .
don &apos;t you talk to me like--
i &apos;ll get up on you .
i ain &apos;t doing nothing , man . this is a free country .
i don &apos;t even know why we have weather people in san diego .
maybe you could become one of those ,
when you &apos;re better .
i mean , how hard could it be ?
i &apos;ll get her .
hi , girl . hungry ?
do you want to try breastfeeding her ?
oh , no , there &apos;s no point , not with the brace .
i can &apos;t get her in the right position .
i pumped earlier . it &apos;s in the fridge .
okay .
you &apos;re okay to stay today ?
hi , sweet girl .
sure you don &apos;t want to go see that boyfriend of yours ?
didn &apos;t you say he was leaving soon ?
oh , yeah .
he &apos;s going on tour with his band .
but it &apos;s fine .
and your moms , they &apos;re okay with this ,
with you spending all your time here ?
oh , yeah . they &apos;re totally fine .
and they &apos;re not mad ?
about what ?
that i kept isabella .
no .
not at all .
they &apos;re happy for you , i promise .
there you go , beautiful .
good morning .
hey , so i &apos;ve got a few projects i could use your help with .
we need to repaint the chairs from outside ,
the metal ones . would you mind ?
yeah .
okay , great .
i picked up some spray paint on my way in .
we just gotta make sure we lock up the storage cabinet before we go home .
lock it up ? why ?
kids steal it . they huff with it ,
or sell it to gangs .
looks like i left it in my car . i &apos;ll be right back .
have you got computers in here ?
the center is for foster kids .
i am a foster kid .
okay .
well , what &apos;s your name ?
a.j.
okay , a.j. ,
well , the computers are over here .
is there the registration ?
yeah .
i &apos;m brandon .
ekaterina .
ekater ...
just call me kat .
okay .
so what are you ... ?
piano performance .
oh , yeah ? me too .
name and discipline ?
brandon foster , piano .
sorry .
you said brandon foster ?
yes .
oh , wait . here you are .
but you &apos;re not a pianist . you &apos;re here as a composer .
oh , you &apos;re a composer too , huh ?
i &apos;m tony .
i &apos;m sorry , there must be some mistake .
i &apos;m definitely , like , a pianist .
maybe there &apos;s someone i could ...
miss sanderson , hi . miss sanderson .
oh , teri , please . hi , brandon .
excuse me , i think there &apos;s been a mix @-@ up .
they &apos;ve got me listed as a composer and i &apos;m a pianist .
oh , did you not read your acceptance letter ?
i &apos;m pretty sure it was clear .
i may have seen the word &quot; congratulations &quot;
and started running around the house .
to be honest , i didn &apos;t think your technique was
where it needed to be for the performance track .
but i did hear something in that piece you wrote ,
something really special .
this is a wonderful program .
i hope you &apos;ll give it a chance .
i couldn &apos;t have noticed that you didn &apos;t metion
that the truck had been stolen till the day after the accident .
why was that exactly ?
i already told the cops all this .
well , you didn &apos;t tell these cops .
i used to park it behind the garage
&apos;cause it didn &apos;t have the tags
or the registration or ...
right .
yeah , but the key was in the vehicle when it crashed .
i used to leave the keys up behind the visor .
i never expected anybody to steal a piece of junk like that .
i didn &apos;t even know it was gone till my son said something .
oh , you have a son ?
oh , i don &apos;t recall seeing that mentioned
in the reports . does he live here ?
oh , no .
he stays with some buddies over on cliff .
that &apos;s why i didn &apos;t say anything about him .
well , if you could give us any kind of contact information
you have for him , we &apos;d really appreciate it .
what &apos;s his name ?
thought you might be hungry .
thank you .
so you work here ?
yeah , just part of my privileged life ,
along with seven foster homes and juvie , you know .
i &apos;m sorry .
what &apos;s that ?
oh , it &apos;s stupid .
i don &apos;t think it is . i like it .
let me see .
who is that ?
it &apos;s ... it &apos;s dumb .
it &apos;s this guy that me and my brother made up
when we got put into the system and sent to different homes .
he was like our own private superhero , you know ?
yeah , me and my brother could have used someone like that .
we &apos;d ...
we &apos;d put the symbol in the windows of our bedrooms ,
and that meant we were supposed to meet at belmont park .
like the bat signal ?
yeah .
yeah .
where is your brother now ?
okay , well , if you need anything , just let me know .
what ?
you &apos;re so good at that , callie .
you &apos;re so good
with the kids who come in here ,
getting them to open up . it &apos;s pretty amazing .
now i really hope
that when this independent study of yours is over ,
that you &apos;ll keep working here .
you &apos;ve got a real gift .
who is that ?
uh , it &apos;s me actually .
i wrote it for my audition .
oh , really ?
it &apos;s lovely .
you think so ?
&apos;cause i , you know ... i ... i thought i was coming here as a pianist
and they put me in the composing track .
so i don &apos;t know what i want to do now .
really ?
that &apos;s not a demotion , you know .
composers are the real rock stars around here .
i mean , think about it .
nobody remembers the guy who played mozart
in front of the king ,
but everybody knows mozart .
so the stage will be set up here ,
the refreshments here , where we can keep a good eye on them .
and over here will be the
sort of hangout area . does that sound good ?
perfect . great work .
and day one of summer school ?
off without a hitch , as far as i can tell .
it &apos;s great that we were able to hire those extra teachers .
thank you , kilfer grant .
speaking of the kilfer grant ,
one of the benefits that comes with it is a trip for two
to d.c. for their national conference .
and it &apos;s coming up , like , early july , i think .
i hear it &apos;s incredible . the most amazing
progressive thinkers in the business are all there .
so can you come ?
okay .
when are things gonna stop being weird between us ?
i don &apos;t even know
what that little kiss was about .
i &apos;m straight .
i was married .
it was nothing . right ?
yes , absolutely .
okay , good .
so can we just go back to how things were ?
yes .
and you &apos;ll think about the trip ?
i &apos;m telling you , we &apos;ll have a great time .
i promise .
so , as you know ,
composers are paired with a musician for their magnum opus--
the piece that you &apos;ll be working on together all summer long .
the big news is , this year ,
the piece deemed best by the faculty
will be performed with the los angeles philharmonic
at disney hall .
oh my god , i hope i get kat .
she &apos;s , hands down , the best one here .
okay , so here we go .
mischa , you &apos;re working with andre .
tony , you &apos;ll be with jin .
and , brandon , you &apos;ll be working with ...
wait , no . yes .
right , you &apos;ll be working with kat .
yes , kat .
i &apos;m sorry ,
i &apos;m one of the most accomplished musicians here .
there &apos;s no way you &apos;re pairing me with him . he &apos;s brand new .
i &apos;m s ... i ... i thought
you liked my piece . you said it was lovely .
yeah , i was being nice . sure , it &apos;s lovely ,
for a six @-@ year @-@ old . you &apos;re not ready for this .
i &apos;ve been coming to this
camp every summer for the last five years .
and i &apos;m certainly not gonna lose my chance of playing disney hall
because i got partnered with some amateur .
brandon , please forgive kat .
she &apos;s very passionate about her work .
and i &apos;m sorry , kat , but
these partnerships aren &apos;t up for discussion .
i , for one , am very excited
about what you and brandon come up with together .
but ...
end of conversation .
kieran , you &apos;ll be working with reese .
christian and kay , and timothy ...
okay , so your dad &apos;s coming to pick you up , right ?
do you want me to wait ?
no , i &apos;m good .
okay , i &apos;ll call you .
hey , what are you guys ... ?
daria signed us up to decorate for the party tomorrow .
can you just tell me one thing ?
why ? why would you break up with me ?
i don &apos;t get it .
you know what ? just forget it , okay ?
why don &apos;t you just tell her ?
tell her what ?
that you &apos;re into jude . it &apos;s completely obvious .
i ... i just ...
i can &apos;t .
hey . come in .
is that a baby book ?
is there something you want to tell me ?
no , it &apos;s for isabella .
figured .
i mean , it would be kind of hard for you to be , you know ...
because we haven &apos;t , you know ...
so are you avoiding me ?
i mean , is that why you &apos;re spending all your time with the baby ?
no .
not really .
i mean , i have to do something all summer too , right ?
and you &apos;re gonna be gone .
and ana really needs the help , so ...
and that &apos;s why i &apos;ve barely seen you at all in the last week ?
you &apos;re coming to the party tomorrow at school , right ?
yeah , if i can .
mariana , it &apos;s the start of the tour .
look , i &apos;ll be there as
soon as elena gets home from the bakery , okay ?
okay .
what am i gonna do without these lips for three whole weeks ?
i have no idea .
don &apos;t forget i &apos;m only here till noon today .
oh , yeah . that &apos;s right . why is that again ?
well , i decided that i &apos;m doing
everything in my power this summer
to act like a normal teenager ,
so i &apos;m going to the stupid anchor beach end @-@ of @-@ the @-@ year party thing .
oh , yeah ? where are they having it ?
on the beach , like , right in front of the school .
wow , nice .
we never had any parties like that where i went .
they were like , &quot; school &apos;s over . get out of here . &quot;
yeah , i know . i still can &apos;t believe i go to school--
callie , everything okay ?
yeah , yeah , everything &apos;s fine .
hey . hey , a.j. , wait up .
look , you can &apos;t sleep in there , okay ?
but if you ran away from your foster home ,
or if you need anything , i can help you , okay ?
i won &apos;t get you in trouble , i promise .
hey , sorry i &apos;m so late . the bus never came .
i ended up having to steal jude &apos;s bike .
elena , you can get going ! i &apos;m here !
she left already .
i went to the doctor yesterday
and he told me i could take off my brace .
said i need to take it easy ,
but i can start doing normal things again ,
for a few hours .
well , do you need me to take her ?
she probably needs to be changed .
nope , just changed her .
well , you should probably lift her head a little bit .
her neck is ...
do you need any help ?
okay , well .
be careful . i don &apos;t want you to hurt yourself .
you know what ? i &apos;m fine .
i &apos;ve got this . thank you .
sorry .
listen , i really appreciate you coming all this time ,
but i think i need to spend some time alone with bella , okay ?
okay .
don &apos;t you have a school party today ?
go .
you know , go see that boyfriend before he leaves .
give him a reason to miss you .
it &apos;s my dad &apos;s truck , okay ?
i don &apos;t know what you think i got to do with it .
why would i steal it ? i got my own car .
and a suspended driver &apos;s license .
maybe you just didn &apos;t feel like driving your own car that day .
look , what do you want me to say ? i didn &apos;t take the truck .
i haven &apos;t driven that thing in , i don &apos;t know , a few years .
okay .
you don &apos;t mind hanging out for a few minutes ?
thank you .
you see that cut above his eye ?
looks to be about three weeks old to me , and totally consistent
with someone who might have hit their head on a steering wheel .
i checked his prints .
and ?
they don &apos;t match the ones on the steering wheel .
you &apos;re kidding .
there &apos;s no way it could be him .
okay .
also they &apos;re sending the cars to the junkyard ,
so if you need anything out of the volvo ,
this is your last chance .
i quit my coding class ,
and i gave up my whole summer for her and the baby ,
and now it &apos;s like she doesn &apos;t even want me around .
i &apos;d be willing to bet that &apos;s not entirely true .
well , you would lose that bet .
and stupid mat is leaving .
probably gonna forget
all about me and hook up with all those groupies .
you think someone &apos;s little sister has groupies ?
he is not gonna forget about you .
well , i &apos;m gonna make sure of that .
i &apos;m gonna have sex with him .
wait , you &apos;re gonna lose your virginity ?
are you sure you &apos;re ready for that ?
shouldn &apos;t you be at idyllwild ?
yeah , i didn &apos;t go today .
couldn &apos;t miss the party , right ?
i &apos;m not really sure it &apos;s for me .
what ? really ?
they put me in as ...
wait , brandon , sorry . i &apos;ll be right back .
sorry i crashed your party .
how did you even know i was here ?
you and that guy were talking about it this morning .
i didn &apos;t know where else to go , so ...
what happened ?
i was looking for a place to sleep tonight , you know ,
someplace safe , and a couple guys jumped me .
you ...
you said you could help me .
yeah . yes , i will .
but i can &apos;t really do that
unless i know exactly what &apos;s going on .
i ran away from my foster family .
they was pretty cool and all , but i ran away
&apos;cause i was supposed to meet up with my brother .
he aged out a couple of years ago ,
so he &apos;s been on his own .
but we were supposed to take off and get out of town .
we had this whole plan , but when i was supposed to meet him ,
he never showed up .
okay , what if we called your foster parents ?
they always told me , &quot; you run one time ,
that &apos;s it . we &apos;re done . &quot;
okay , so if you can &apos;t go back ,
we can get you emergency placement .
but where are you gonna sleep tonight ?
you got it ?
yeah , i got it .
okay .
ok , wait , wait . so you two are gay for each other ?
yeah . so what ? you got something to say about it ?
no , man . it &apos;s all good .
i just heard and i thought--
you thought what ?
nothing , man . it &apos;s cool .
then get out of my face .
i knew it wasn &apos;t me .
shut up , daria .
i thought we weren &apos;t gonna say anything .
don &apos;t be mad at connor .
it wasn &apos;t him . it was me .
what ?
well , i thought i was helping .
i thought you were the one who didn &apos;t want to come out ,
so i figured nobody was gonna care .
i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s not like anyone cares if you &apos;re gay .
i &apos;m not gay , okay ?
wait , jude . jude .
do you like the new stuff ...
the new songs , i mean ?
i do like the new stuff .
but i like other stuff too .
oh , yeah ?
and i was thinking
maybe we should do some other stuff tonight .
i mean , you &apos;re leaving soon and ...
on the beach ?
why not ? it &apos;s romantic .
it &apos;s kind of public .
not up here .
it &apos;s your last night .
yeah , i know ,
but , mariana , i don &apos;t want to do it .
i mean , i want to do it ,
but not like this .
it &apos;s our first time , and ...
we gotta get on the road .
we &apos;ve got a midnight show in l.a ..
i &apos;m sorry .
i should probably get back , help load up the van .
okay . i think i &apos;m just gonna ...
okay , well ,
i &apos;ll see you in a few weeks .
i &apos;ll miss you .
i &apos;ll miss you too .
okay .
nice set .
i mean , the new guy you got
could use a little finesse .
it &apos;s kind of like watching a bear play keyboard , but--
we can &apos;t all be classical pianists , you know .
right . no kidding .
turns out , i &apos;m not one either .
they made me a composer at idyllwild .
i &apos;m not even there to play .
is that , is that a bad thing ?
i mean , it &apos;s not what i wanted .
okay , sure ,
but you &apos;re a great composer , brandon .
you love writing songs .
why are you acting like this is
some kind of epic fail or something ?
&apos;cause the kids there are totally out of my league .
is this what happens
when everything just comes naturally to you ...
you just give up the minute something gets hard ?
besides , i &apos;m sure you &apos;re better than you think .
you guys aren &apos;t even playing my songs .
out of respect , brandon . they aren &apos;t ours to play .
well , i think you should ,
play them , i mean .
if i &apos;m gonna be a composer ,
i &apos;d better get used to other people playing my songs ,
even bear paws over there .
what are you doing here ?
well , you know how to throw a party , huh ?
well , i was lonely .
stefanie marie adams foster ,
you haven &apos;t had a night alone in that house
for the last 10 years .
i don &apos;t for one second buy that you got lonely .
what is it ?
i &apos;m a mess .
i &apos;m trying to hold it together .
i &apos;m trying to , i &apos;m trying to find out
who the hell did this and ...
they told , they said someone was dead .
they said there were reported fatalities .
and when i walked up and i saw the volvo ,
it was crushed like a beer can .
i thought ...
i thought we lost them .
i thought my babies were gone .
and i thought i &apos;d never be okay , ever again .
i just wanted to see you . i just wanted to see you .
my love .
my sweet , sweet love .
it &apos;s all gonna be okay .
hey , what are you doing here ?
i go to school here , remember ?
why aren &apos;t you back at the ...
not really in the mood .
yeah , me neither . do you want a beer ?
oops , i &apos;m sorry .
why are you apologizing ?
it &apos;s good for the kids to see that you &apos;re a human being .
not some education reform monster ?
yes , exactly .
speaking of education reform ,
i ...
i can &apos;t go to the conference .
really ? oh , no .
are you sure ?
i am .
i , i have just
too much going on at home right now
for me to even consider planning a trip away . so ...
i hope you understand .
of course .
of course i do .
you &apos;d better leave the lights off .
right . smart .
please don &apos;t , like , mess with anything .
i won &apos;t , i promise .
thank you .
i should , i should thank you .
it probably sounds dumb ,
but i have to write
this paper for my independent study
and i had no idea what to do .
but now i think i &apos;m gonna do it
on what happens to kids when they &apos;re separated in the system ,
like you and your brother .
glad i could help .
okay , well , i &apos;ll be back first thing in the morning
to open up , so ...
&apos;night .
&apos;night .
so you don &apos;t miss her ?
your mom ?
i do sometimes , but ...
out of sight , out of mind , you know ?
okay , how do you do that ?
how do you get your hair to fall like that ?
it &apos;s softer than mine .
what do you do ?
do you use some special conditioner or something ?
no , it just comes out of my head like this .
it &apos;s just so pretty .
thank you .
you &apos;re welcome .
i look it all over for you .
you know , you could have made it a little easier on me , all right ?
i am on crutches .
so i don &apos;t ...
i don &apos;t get it .
what do you mean , you &apos;re not gay ?
do you not like me ?
no , of course i like you .
do you not like me like that ?
no , i do . i just ...
my whole life i &apos;ve always been labeled as something ...
&quot; the new kid , &quot; or &quot; the foster kid , &quot;
or &quot; the kid with the dead mom . &quot; and i &apos;m sick of it .
i mean , why can &apos;t i just be jude ?
i just want to be jude for a while .
does that mean you don &apos;t want to be my boyfriend ?
no .
okay .
okay , good . &apos; cause i thought ...
no , i promise .
another bad dream ?
no , just thinking .
everything okay ?
absolutely .
you know , i was doing a little thinking myself .
i know you &apos;re gonna say no ,
but i think that we should
plan a little trip , just you and me .
we could really use a getaway .
i think it &apos;s a terrific idea .
