did &quot; a &quot; send this to you ?
no , i took it out of paige &apos;s bag .
why would paige have it ?
she may be &quot; a , &quot; aria .
are you emily fields ?
yes .
i &apos;m maya &apos;s cousin nate .
you must be amy .
are you maggie ?
i am .
i like this age . it &apos;s so sweet .
malcolm also happens to be my son .
i &apos;m not gonna ask you to explain anything ,
because you won &apos;t ... i &apos;ll find it out myself
i think we need to keep things on a friendship level .
what about the other night ?
it doesn &apos;t change things .
i am going to help you stop &quot; a. &quot;
and i &apos;m not asking for your permission .
you and paige have been
seeing each other on and off for almost a year ,
and she &apos;s never mentioned anything about ali to you ?
are you finished ? because i am .
shh . it &apos;s okay . it &apos;s okay .
so , the deceased was a friend of yours ?
miss fields , please . i &apos;m trying to understand what happened here .
did you know the victim ?
yes .
the deceased was a friend of yours ?
jury selection is expected to conclude today ,
and defense attorney veronica hastings
made a statement to reporters this morning .
my client is emotionally exhausted .
but he &apos;s relieved to know
that he &apos;s finally going to have the opportunity
to clear his name .
i mean , it &apos;s like all eyes are on rosewood .
can &apos;t help but think that toby
took that job in bucks county just to avoid all this .
she &apos;s taking the long way
because reporters are hounding her for interviews .
okay , how are we gonna do this ?
well , emily think she &apos;s coming over here so we can apologize .
but when she realizes what this is ,
she &apos;ll probably be more mad at us than she was before .
i am not looking forward to seeing that .
in a successful intervention ,
the loved one feels safe , not judged .
great . right ,
so we &apos;ll start out all warm and fuzzy ,
and then we just have to hit her with the truth .
yeah . and that &apos;s your cue .
okay , so ... paige was jealous of ali ,
we know that paige was jealous of maya ,
and she was with emily that night ,
it was easy for her to set us up .
right . and she has the other earring .
so she must have ali &apos;s body , right ?
yeah .
wait . i don &apos;t get it .
if paige was so into emily ,
why would she drug her ?
and then why would she drug herself ?
wait ! hanna ,
i thought we were all on the same &quot; a &quot; page here .
we are . this is a practice run .
right , okay .
uh , drugging yourself is the best alibi ever .
classic sharon stone move .
remember that movie , basic instinct ?
no .
no .
she wrote a murder mystery novel
to cover up a crime that she was about to commit .
it was actually kind of genius .
look , remember , i &apos;m emily here .
we still think that &quot; a &quot; is working with mona .
so what is your connection ?
two people who hated ali .
maybe one of them killed her
and the other one covered their tracks .
or are still covering their tracks
by stealing the body and then pinning it on us .
yeah . and the ultimate prize is
paige gets emily all to herself .
hey , em .
hey . you want some coffee ?
em , you know how much we love you , right ?
we love you enough to tell you the truth ,
even when it hurts .
this doesn &apos;t sound like an apology .
i had to get you here , emily .
i &apos;m sorry for lying .
what is this ?
it &apos;s the three people who love you the most in the world
trying to get you to see who paige really is .
i can &apos;t believe it .
the trial &apos;s started ,
and this how you guys show up for me .
we support you , emily . we do .
but we &apos;re pretty sure that garrett did not kill maya .
and you think paige did ?
are you out of your friggin &apos; minds ?
when did it become so easy for you
lie to your friends ?
emily , wait .
we found that at the trunk show .
in paige &apos;s pack .
it &apos;s the other earring aria put in ali &apos;s casket .
we found a lot of other things exactly where &quot; a &quot; has put them .
three against one . &quot; a &quot; wins .
that was exactly what paige wanted .
great . so now what ?
em wasn &apos;t in first period .
i think she ditched school today .
does three messages and six texts make me a stalker ?
this is the part where you &apos;re supposed to reassure me
that i &apos;m just being a caring friend
and emily &apos;s going to be fine .
she was totally right in calling me out for lying this morning .
so if anybody needs an intervention , it &apos;s me .
what &apos;s going on ?
i haven &apos;t told you guys yet because ezra doesn &apos;t even know .
well , whatever it is , we &apos;re here for you . you &apos;ll be okay .
wes let it slip that ezra
got a girl pregnant before he left for college .
their mom paid her to take care of it ,
but she didn &apos;t take care of it , she had the baby .
it &apos;s a little boy .
ezra has a kid ?
yeah , and i &apos;m not done .
wait , there &apos;s more ?
i found the baby &apos;s mom ... but i didn &apos;t tell ezra .
so ezra has no idea ?
he thinks she had an abortion .
aria , you have to tell him the truth .
well , for whatever reason , she doesn &apos;t want him to know .
and i pushed him to call her .
when they talked , she didn &apos;t say anything about it .
if he finds out that you knew and you didn &apos;t tell him ...
i just really feel like i &apos;m
about to rattle the cage of a sleeping giant .
do you remember what ali said about secrets keeping us close ?
she was wrong .
they tear us apart .
if you &apos;ve got something to say , just say it .
emily called me this morning in tears .
what the hell is wrong with you guys ?
what do you want , paige ?
i want you to leave emily alone .
she &apos;s got a lot going on right now ,
she doesn &apos;t need you guys making it worse for her .
if you think i &apos;m gonna let you hurt her ,
you are underestimating me .
if you don &apos;t back down ,
you &apos;re the one who &apos;s gonna get hurt , spencer .
i won &apos;t let you come between us .
i know who you are .
they think they know you , but they &apos;re wrong .
do they just not want you to be happy ?
they don &apos;t trust anybody . it &apos;s because of &quot; a. &quot;
you mean mona .
if i tell you something ,
promise me it doesn &apos;t leave this room .
emily , you can trust me with your life .
if you tell anyone , it won &apos;t be safe .
there &apos;s nothing i wouldn &apos;t do to protect you .
it &apos;s not me i &apos;m worried about . it &apos;s you .
em , what is it ?
we think there &apos;s somebody else helping mona .
have you told the police ?
that night i came over ,
the night ali &apos;s body was taken , &quot; a &quot; set us up .
they had a photo of us at her grave ,
and we look guilty as hell .
so your friends think it &apos;s me ?
that i &apos;m this new &quot; a &quot; ?
that &apos;s what you were arguing about this morning .
they &apos;ll figure it out . they &apos;ll realize they &apos;re wrong .
and in the meantime they &apos;ll
do everything they can to keep me away from you .
i won &apos;t let that happen .
i have some family stuff to take care of .
but i &apos;ll see you monday .
and i &apos;ll go to the trial every day .
i promise i won &apos;t leave your side .
it &apos;s voice mail again .
she has to be home .
maybe we should just go over there .
so things just went from worse to worser .
that &apos;s not a word . but continue .
paige wasn &apos;t in spanish today . yo hablo sicko .
what ?
she went home sick .
or is she at emily &apos;s ?
i don &apos;t know about you two ,
but i &apos;m really willing to take this to the cops .
no ! i &apos;m already on their radar .
for all i know , paige smeared my blood all over that anklet .
well , emily might be with paige right now ,
and we all know what she &apos;s capable of .
i think we should call her parents .
we &apos;ll tell them everything , together .
spencer &apos;s right . there &apos;s strength in numbers .
all right .
stand down , bitches .
play it my way and emily stays safe . &quot; a. &quot;
if we don &apos;t hear from them the next hour ,
i think we should revisit the idea of telling her parents .
i agree .
this is probably paige just killing time
so she can just find a way to weasel herself out of this .
hanna .
i &apos;m just thinking about emily .
she finally gets over maya ,
and now she &apos;s stuck with some twisted psycho bitch .
it &apos;s just another monster that alison created .
she &apos;s been gone two years , and we &apos;re still caught in her web .
it &apos;s from &quot; a. &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s settle this .
alison &apos;s grave . ten p.m. bring maya &apos;s bag . &quot;
there &apos;s an attachment .
it &apos;s another picture from that night .
paige can brings us down and leave emily completely in the clear .
this must have been her plan all along .
get rid of us , and then she can have emily all to herself .
but she hasn &apos;t sent these to the cops for a reason ,
and it &apos;s probably because
there &apos;s something in maya &apos;s bag that she needs .
something that proves that she killed her .
no , we searched every inch of that bag .
you guys ...
another picture .
&quot; tell emily and i &apos;ll leave you holding the bag . &quot;
is that ali ?
oh , my god .
what was that ?
what was that ?
do you think your mom &apos;s home early ?
mom ?
there &apos;s somebody downstairs .
was it paige ?
what are you doing here ? ! i almost killed you !
with a pink , furry lamp , hanna ?
no . caleb , seriously , what are you doing here ?
you &apos;re supposed to be watching emily &apos;s house .
but there are , like , a dozen reporters camped out on her lawn ,
her mom is home-- she &apos;s safe .
we heard from paige and mona .
you guys aren &apos;t showing up there alone .
hello .
hi , em , it &apos;s me .
please don &apos;t hang up .
i want to make sure you &apos;re okay .
spencer and i are in town ,
and there are reporters everywhere .
so are you okay ?
nate &apos;s going out of town this weekend .
i &apos;m going with him .
that &apos;s great . where are you going ?
the lighthouse rock inn . he found it online .
look , i know it doesn &apos;t seem like it ,
but we are here for you , em .
you &apos;re right .
it doesn &apos;t seem like it .
they &apos;re three @-@ deep on the lawn out there .
yeah , i just got off the phone with hanna .
she said that reporters are all over town .
i know you want to leave , but i really feel like
you need to be with family this weekend .
i will be with family . maya &apos;s family .
i told you , nate &apos;s parents are going to be there too .
it &apos;s our way of celebrating maya
before this whole thing becomes all about garrett .
and nate &apos;s still just a friend ?
he wasn &apos;t at first , but he is now .
i really need a friend this weekend .
are you sure you don &apos;t want me to come ?
don &apos;t worry . he &apos;ll take good care of me .
call me when you get there ?
i will .
oh . thanks , angie .
it actually makes me feel a lot better
knowing emily &apos;s going to be far away from here tonight .
yeah , me too .
so i &apos;ll pick you up at nine .
yeah , see you then .
toby ?
no , please , don &apos;t let me go .
i &apos;m so sorry for everything--
for all the secrets .
spencer , i know who you are .
you never have to say you &apos;re sorry .
here .
thank you .
ezra ?
love you , babe .
expecting company ?
it &apos;s probably mrs. rosenthal from next door .
she locks herself out at least once a week ,
so i keep a key .
that &apos;s sweet .
it &apos;s right by the door .
maggie ?
it sounds like a cliche , but i was in the neighborhood .
well , please come--come in .
maggie , this is ...
my girlfriend , aria .
ezra , there &apos;s something that i need to tell you .
it &apos;s really nice to meet you ... aria .
i &apos;m picking up asignments here and there .
seems like things are really starting to come together ..
i think it &apos;s terrific that you &apos;re writing .
but why did you give up teaching ?
uh , it &apos;s complicated .
that is got to be mrs. rosenthal .
you know the truth . why haven &apos;t you told him ?
that &apos;s not something you spring on someone .
what are you doing here ?
i was curious . he &apos;s the father of my son .
yeah , he deserves to know that .
did you come here to tell him ?
maybe .
i-- i &apos;m not sure .
look , i &apos;ve been through a lot .
i need some time to sort this all out .
i &apos;ve earned it , okay ?
no .
no , it &apos;s not okay .
if he figures out that i &apos;m lying to him--
he won &apos;t figure it out . i promise . please .
there we go .
wait . so what you &apos;re asking me to do--
there &apos;s more to this story than you know .
for malcolm &apos;s sake ,
i need to figure out what &apos;s best for him .
i &apos;m not the only one here with a secret ... amy .
can &apos;t remember her keys ,
yet she never forgets dessert .
is everything okay ?
yeah .
i &apos;ll get plates for this .
thank you .
hey . i thought you were taking a shower .
is that a gun ?
where did you get that ?
you know what , i don &apos;t want to know . just get rid of it .
hanna , this &quot; a &quot; almost killed my mom .
okay ? i &apos;m not letting you go
to that cemetery without some kind of protection .
well , if you plan to bring that gun ,
then you can forget about coming tonight .
it &apos;s not just your call , hanna .
is it loaded ?
listen to me , okay ?
caleb , i swear to god , get rid of that thing now
or don &apos;t let the door hit you in the ass in the way out .
all right .
i hear you .
it &apos;ll stay there until monday and then i &apos;ll get rid of it .
are you good with that ?
hey . it &apos;s gonna be okay .
i promise .
it just feels too easy ...
paige and mona giving up like this .
we &apos;re gonna put an end to this tonight .
now , remember ,
there &apos;s two of them and four of us .
i &apos;m here .
i understand .
are you sure ?
yes .
did you get that job in bucks county just to get away from me ?
i know it looks that way ... but no .
you &apos;re going back .
spencer ...
i am exactly where i need to be .
i love you .
i love you too .
hey , han , it &apos;s spence .
please tell me that you have maya &apos;s bag ,
because i am so ready for this to be over .
change of plans .
right , the app is voice activated ,
so it &apos;ll record any sound that it hears .
and i can pick up the feed ,
so i &apos;ll be with you every step of the way .
caleb , i think that you should take maya &apos;s bag with you .
it &apos;s our only form of leverage , and if she doesn &apos;t admit
to digging up the body , she doesn &apos;t get the bag .
all right . i should just get out of sight .
what do we do now ?
we wait for &quot; a. &quot;
hello ?
you have one minute . get out .
nate ?
it &apos;s ten @-@ forty .
i get mona being fashionably late ,
but paige ? something &apos;s not right .
we &apos;re meeting &quot; a &quot; in front of ali &apos;s empty grave .
there &apos;s nothing right about this .
who are you calling ?
nate .
hey , nate , it &apos;s hanna . can you give me a call back ?
i just want to make sure that you guys are okay .
caleb , do you see anything ?
nothing .
not a car in sight .
looks like a storm &apos;s on the way .
i went for a great hike .
it is dead up here .
not a soul in sight .
must be off season .
my parents will be here in a few hours .
did you call your mom ?
yeah . everything &apos;s fine .
okay , there &apos;s a lighthouse rock inn near bayhead .
there &apos;s one in belmar , too .
nate &apos;s still not answering .
maybe paige sent us here
to keep us away from emily .
so she could get to her .
it &apos;s caleb .
hey , where are you going ?
i just heard you .
i don &apos;t think paige ever planned on meeting you guys .
i &apos;m heading to belmar .
you guys go to bayhead .
we &apos;ll call you later .
we &apos;re going to bayhead .
i brought some dvds .
i thought we might watch a movie later .
i &apos;m not , um , really feeling that great .
i think i &apos;m gonna get some fresh air .
i &apos;ll go with you .
it &apos;s really dark out .
i &apos;ll find my way .
you better wear your jacket .
it &apos;s cold out there .
oh , my god . you scared me half to death .
not really ... but i will .
i wanted to give you this in person ,
because i want to be there when you watch it .
i &apos;ve said so many wrong things to you .
emily , this is me taking the time to get it right .
i &apos;ve been staying at noel kahn &apos;s cabin
trying to figure a way out of the mess that i got myself into
and i &apos;m not totally sure ,
but i think that stalker from true north found me ,
i thought i saw him at a party the other night .
this isn &apos;t about him , it &apos;s about us .
i &apos;m coming home , and ...
if you still want to be with me ,
if i can still count on us ,
i know i can get through this .
how could you not fall in love with her smile ?
why do you have this ?
i think you know the answer .
what you don &apos;t know ...
is how much i loved her .
don &apos;t look at me like that .
i said don &apos;t look me like that .
when i found you at the brew ,
hearing you talk about maya ...
i felt so connected to her .
it &apos;s ironic .
you took her from me ,
and then you gave me a little bit of her back .
did you bring me here to kill me too ?
i &apos;m gonna do to you what you did to me .
i &apos;m gonna take something from you ,
and you are gonna watch me do it .
you &apos;re gonna make a right at the intersection .
how far away are you from belmar ?
i &apos;m not sure . a couple of miles , maybe .
can you just promise me that you &apos;ll be careful ?
there it is on the hill .
hanna ... i love you .
i love you too , caleb .
when we kissed ,
i thought , &quot; maybe i don &apos;t have to hurt her .
maybe i can move on with emily . &quot;
but just like maya , you were playing me .
that &apos;s not true .
i gave you a choice . you picked her .
looks like this place is closed .
wait . no .
there &apos;s a light on in that cabin .
i want you to see this .
no . no !
my friends know i &apos;m here .
my mom knows . they &apos;ll find you .
you underestimate me , emily .
i have been planning this for months .
they think you &apos;re here with nate st . germaine .
and he doesn &apos;t exist .
who are you ? really ?
lyndon .
i &apos;m lyndon james .
lyndon , you don &apos;t have to do this .
you can leave . you can walk away . i won &apos;t tell anybody .
i &apos;ve waited as long as i could .
but i think jenna saw me with maya .
and now with her parents in town for the trial ... time &apos;s up .
damn it .
em !
there &apos;s no one here . i &apos;m calling caleb .
oh , come on .
come on , come on .
come on . come on !
911 , what is the nature of your emergency ?
hello ?
hello ?
no !
come here ! where are you going ?
emily ! emily .
emily .
emily .
come here .
it &apos;s okay .
caleb ! no ! ! !
caleb ! ! !
so , the deceased was a friend of yours ?
miss fields , please .
i &apos;m trying to understand what happened here .
when i was with emily yesterday ,
i got an anonymous text .
ten p.m. saturday , rosewood cemetery ,
or emily gets hurt .
did you know the victim ?
yes .
was he a friend of yours ?
he got me before i got there .
i can &apos;t do this right now .
please just let me talk to my friend .
officers .
i &apos;m so sorry !
han .
caleb &apos;s still in surgery .
how ya holdin &apos;p ?
i &apos;m fine .
pam fields , please pick up the nearest courtesy phone .
must be dad .
no , i never reached him . he doesn &apos;t even know we &apos;re here .
emily , i owe you one .
that was odd . there was no one there .
mom , he &apos;s out of jail ?
emily , i &apos;m so sorry you had to go through that tonight .
but i want you know that you helped an innocent victim .
because of you , garrett reynolds is a free man .
if i knew nate was gonna get garrett out ,
i would have stayed in tonight .
you have to get maya &apos;s cell phone back .
that shouldn &apos;t be too difficult--
paige doesn &apos;t even know she has it .
it sucks we didn &apos;t get to make that phone call .
ring ring . &quot; what &apos;s paige doing with maya &apos;s cell phone ?
o @-@ m @-@ g . she must be the killer . &quot;
oh , well , even the best laid plans go awry .
i &apos;ll see you soon .
