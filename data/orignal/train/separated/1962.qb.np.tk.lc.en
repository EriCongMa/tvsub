dr. hunt and i go back a bit .
she &apos;s joining the program at grey @-@ sloan memorial .
perfect penny killed my husband .
get her out of my house .
wilson , go away !
if you &apos;re out with grey , you &apos;re out , and i &apos;m out .
you just signed divorce papers , and you don &apos;t want a drink ?
what are you , pregnant ?
i think i am .
you have to tell him .
obviously , i &apos;m going to tell him -- when i &apos;m ready .
if you want to start over , forget all that ,
let &apos;s do it .
just like new ?
this is major thorpe .
it &apos;s great what you did in there . i &apos;m just glad i saw it .
well , we said we &apos;ll follow up , and we will .
i &apos;d like that -- to follow up with you .
that guy definitely just asked for your number .
and that &apos;s what flirting looks like .
when babies are born ,
they usually come out crying like there &apos;s no tomorrow .
it &apos;s loud . it &apos;s jarring .
and it &apos;s completely unfair .
that adorable , tiny baby was forced out of its mother &apos;s womb .
and forced to breathe outside air
into its brand @-@ new little lungs .
it &apos;s human nature .
no one wants to be left out in the cold ...
rejected and alone .
i want to meet with the residents immediately .
when a bedridden patient stays in one place ,
what &apos;s the outcome ?
bedsores .
exactly .
when a surgeon stays in one place , what &apos;s the outcome ?
one of us has bedsores ?
stagnation . complacency .
a limited mind .
you have a short time to learn here , people ,
and you &apos;ve snuggled up to your specialties
like a warm , comfy bed .
well , i am your alarm clock .
i &apos;m pulling you out of bed and broadening your education .
this is a resident scramble .
this is filled with attendings &apos; names .
come on up and draw your new service -- at random .
bingo , shepherd .
put it back !
but i -- - back .
dr. grey , i was told to report to --
did you see the scans ?
yeah , i &apos;m sorry i &apos;m late .
i just got off the phone with bauer medical .
they said - that carson &apos;s recovering well
and his incision sites and flaps are doing great .
that is great news .
yeah , dr. thorpe thought so , too .
he also thought you might have given him the wrong number .
thorpe ? who is thorpe ?
he has the right number .
oh , okay , so you &apos;re just gonna what , ignore his calls ?
wait . will someone please tell me what is going on
and who &quot; he &quot; is ?
meredith exchanged numbers
with a hot military surgeon over at bauer .
he says he called but radio silence .
what ?
it &apos;s nothing .
why wouldn &apos;t you tell me this ?
because it &apos;s nothing .
wilson , are you following me ?
i &apos;m with you today . i &apos;m on your service .
blake is with me .
no , actually , all of - the residents were switched .
you need to go talk to blake , then ,
because i don &apos;t have the time to get you up to speed .
so , how hot is hot ?
we have surgery .
hot .
i heard there were puppies !
i thought it &apos;d weird , you know ,
the small talk , the eye contact ,
the polite eating , but really , it wasn &apos;t .
i mean , she was nice .
it was nice .
so you &apos;re getting out there , huh ?
i don &apos;t know about that .
i mean , it was sudden , but yeah , it was a date .
does kepner know about it ?
no . no , and do not tell her , okay ?
sure . whatever .
i mean , i &apos;m not lying , you know ?
i just don &apos;t want her to hear it from someone else .
i mean , i &apos;ll tell her , you know , when the time is right .
we all hear the dogs , right ?
there are dogs somewhere .
once a month , a rescue group
brings in a bunch of puppies for the kids .
it &apos;s good for morale and healing and crap .
no .
what &apos;s the matter ?
okay , i &apos;m on peds today . no .
hope you like dogs .
hey . long night ?
75 @-@ year @-@ old man ran his car into an electrical pole .
electrocution - and a big intracranial bleed .
and a pacemaker implantation .
so i booked a reservation around 8 : 00,
so we should maybe head out around 7 : 00 . that work ?
yeah , i can do that . how fancy is this ?
well , first date , so i took a big swing .
dr. shepherd .
is this mr. mccoll ?
yes , blake . why ?
the patient &apos;s wife is downstairs .
why are you telling me this ? where &apos;s edwards ?
dr. webber mixed us up today . i pulled your service .
no .
no ?
no , where &apos;s the wife ?
she &apos;s downstairs in admitting .
dr. webber told me --
tell dr. webber i said no .
wait . i &apos;m -- i &apos;m in a whole other bracket ?
yes .
your income has jumped significantly since last year
and your husband &apos;s hasn &apos;t , so ...
are those our taxes ?
chief , stop harassing my patient .
people ask us for free medical advice all the time .
it &apos;s not harassment - unless i don &apos;t want to help her .
i just had fetal surgery
and i &apos;ve been stuck on bed rest for weeks .
which is actually pretty great
if you &apos;re an accountant during tax season --
nothing else to do but work .
no distractions except , well , for this .
see , i @-@ i normally do our taxes .
it &apos;s sort of my thing .
but , courtney thinks
that maybe we should change our filing status --
hey , you .
out . you . present .
you can &apos;t tell me what to do .
fine .
i &apos;ll just -- - yeah .
okay , i don &apos;t even --
warren .
oh . sorry . just give me a minute to --
deluca .
okay , courtney hall , 23 weeks pregnant .
she &apos;s post @-@ op from - a fetal laser photocoagulation
to separate a shared blood vessel
between two of her babies .
wow , uh , quadruplets ?
yeah . that &apos;s what i said when i found out .
oh , good . you got it . this is for you guys .
no , you did not need to do that .
yes , we did .
you are the reason all four of our little deductions
are still alive right now .
babies . she means babies .
you kept all four safe inside where they belong .
and i get to lie here for eight more weeks .
she means &quot; thank you . &quot;
fetal medicine has its perks .
surgery ? oh , god .
well , his heart rhythm had become very erratic ,
probably due to the electrical shock ,
so i had to implant a pacemaker .
oh , no . poor griffin .
the other concern is griffin suffered a brain bleed ,
which i operated on .
a brain bleed ?
your husband will be awake soon ,
and we &apos;ll know more then .
oh , he &apos;s --
well , griffin &apos;s not my husband . he &apos;s --
hello , lena .
how &apos;s my husband ?
i understand he &apos;s been in a terrible accident .
i &apos;m sorry . uh , we thought you were the --
i am the wife .
she &apos;s the slut he &apos;s been hitting on the side .
it &apos;s been 11 years , gayle .
how is griffin ? is he dead ?
his accident was severe .
he needed surgery on his heart and his brain --
so , he &apos;s almost dead ?
we can take you to see him if --
i don &apos;t want to see him until he is dead .
so , first , we need to check on
kim coley &apos;s baby &apos;s tracheal balloon , and after that --
warren . go someplace else .
why ?
&apos;cause you &apos;re on my service , and i said so .
how you feeling ?
uh , good . how are you ?
how are you feeling ?
fine .
12 weeks and fine .
did you tell jackson ?
i &apos;m worried - that you &apos;re doing this alone
when you don &apos;t have to .
i &apos;m not . i &apos;m not alone .
i told you .
okay . okay , okay .
so , then , let &apos;s do this right .
let &apos;s get out in front of it .
i think i &apos;d like to start with booking a 3d ultrasound ,
and then , um , - i &apos;d like to run a genetic test
to see if the fetus - has osteogenesis imperfecta .
no . -
april , i get it .
with what you went through last time ,
you don &apos;t want a bunch of needles
being stuck in your belly -- - arizona , i don &apos;t --
but i can do a cvs ,
and then if it &apos;s there , we &apos;ll see it
and then we &apos;ll just -- we &apos;ll know .
the baby &apos;s not getting tested .
what ?
why ?
because my baby will be fine .
she said , &quot; because my baby &apos;s fine ! &quot;
o.i. can be diagnosed early .
why wouldn &apos;t she take the test ? that &apos;s crazy .
i know .
well , then avery - will have to convince her .
she won &apos;t tell him .
i don &apos;t -- i don &apos;t know what to do .
well , i &apos;m not doing this . i &apos;m not lying to my friends .
no one &apos;s asking you to --
no one asking you to lie .
i say , &quot; pass me the coffee , &quot;
and i feel like i &apos;m lying to him .
well , then , we need to talk to her .
&quot; we &quot; ?
i didn &apos;t want to know about this thing in the first place .
fine . i will talk to her .
so ...
what kind of surgeon is he ?
oncology .
we can work with that .
guessing 40s . kind of tall .
and he &apos;s ranked in the military ,
so he has an authoritative side .
i can hear you .
but you can &apos;t hear the phone ringing .
maybe her ringer &apos;s off .
it &apos;s not . suctioning .
sometimes your ringer is off ,
and it &apos;s been off for so long that you forget that it &apos;s off ,
and you need someone to help you figure out
how to turn it back on .
but once it &apos;s on ...
oh , that &apos;s it .
your ringer needs to be turned on .
you &apos;ve been on vibrate for too long .
shut up .
if i answer , then he &apos;ll ask me out .
and then i &apos;ll have to say no ,
and there will be a lot of back and forth ,
and i won &apos;t know when it &apos;s okay to hang up ,
so why answer ?
dr. grey , i saw all your clinic patients .
can i scrub in ?
did you drain mr. kurtzman &apos;s wound ?
no .
okay , blake , well , go get that done .
wilson .
what ?
forget it .
see ? now you &apos;re mixing up your residents .
you need to get that ringer turned on loud and fast .
my ringer is fine .
are you almost done ?
i have three more returns to get through .
don &apos;t bother her during tax season .
it &apos;s the first rule .
should be done in just a second .
um , okay , there &apos;s baby a.
oh , there &apos;s baby b.
yeah .
she &apos;s gonna be a handful , right , hon ?
she &apos;s a kicker .
and there &apos;s baby d.
and ...
go get robbins , would you ?
yeah .
what ? what ?
is something wrong ?
nothing .
nothing . it &apos;s , um ...
it &apos;s quadruplets , right ?
yeah .
why ?
i &apos;m just , um ...
i &apos;m looking , and uh ... it &apos;s probably just me , but --
what ?
i can only find three babies in here .
if i had known she wasn &apos;t actually his wife --
you should have known .
you &apos;re right .
you &apos;re absolutely right . i just didn &apos;t --
get your facts straight before you let me
go spilling medical information to just anybody .
you embarrassed me .
i &apos;m sorry .
she said that she was his --
why are you even here ? i said to tell dr. webber --
dr. webber said that he chooses to decline your proposal .
well , then take the day off .
dr. webber rejected that , too .
watch his monitors , don &apos;t touch him ,
and stay out of my way .
the nurse will bring up his personal things .
these are patient pamphlets on pacemakers .
give it to the side piece .
she can change his diaper .
i &apos;m waiting for the funeral .
mrs. mccoll , your husband --
my husband , my dear , was a sweet man
who turned into a philandering bastard
who only cared about his money , which i should have known
when he handed me that prenup for my wedding present .
that thing is as tight as my spanx .
i see .
if he dies and we are still married ,
i get his $ 30 million , which is way less than i deserve
for putting up with that son of a bitch .
but it &apos;ll have to do .
i &apos;m waiting him out .
well , i don &apos;t think we have to .
he &apos;s 75 with a bum heart , high blood pressure ,
and a cracked skull .
he probably won &apos;t even wake up . right , dr. shepherd ?
we --
we &apos;re doing everything we can .
you wouldn &apos;t screw with me , would you ?
oh , gayle , i wouldn &apos;t .
there &apos;s not much hope . so there &apos;s hope .
so if you want to just sit right over here and wait ...
why the hell -- - oh , come on .
that &apos;s what she wanted to hear .
it &apos;s refreshing .
i mean , most family members are like ,
&quot; please , please , save him . &quot;
i mean , this takes the pressure off us a bit .
shepherd , i &apos;m kidding .
that &apos;s dark .
yeah , sorry .
really funny , though .
dr. shepherd .
what ?
mr. mccoll &apos;s waking up .
i called that wrong .
what --
who the hell are you ?
mr. mccoll .
griffin , it &apos;s me . it &apos;s lena .
you &apos;ve been in a pretty bad car wreck .
you &apos;ve had surgery --
where &apos;s gayle ? gayle !
where &apos;s gayle ?
griffin , just relax , okay ? you need to calm down .
bugs ! help me . bugs !
he &apos;s hallucinating . give him 5 of haldol --
bugs !
he &apos;s calling me . i &apos;m bugs .
he hasn &apos;t called me that in 30 years .
there you are .
bugs , come here .
bugs , come here .
come here .
honey ...
what &apos;s happening ?
what -- - just --
what happened ?
where would he have gone ?
nowhere . he &apos;s in here .
dr. warren &apos;s just a little behind on his fetal medicine .
he &apos;s in here somewhere .
good .
we came in here with four babies and we want to leave with --
there ! see , there he is . he &apos;s --
just ... moved down .
why ? to get away from his sisters ?
courtney , i &apos;m afraid that you &apos;re in labor .
no , i can &apos;t -- i can &apos;t be . it &apos;s too soon .
months too soon .
no , i can &apos;t have them now .
they &apos;ll -- they &apos;ll all die . i can &apos;t be in labor .
i know . i know .
but you are .
am i even having contractions ? i would notice , right ?
when the babies are this small ,
sometimes you don &apos;t even feel the contractions .
well , that &apos;s because she shouldn &apos;t be having them .
are you sure you &apos;re not wrong ?
no , i &apos;m not wrong . - from the position of baby c --
charles . we &apos;re calling him charles .
okay , doug . we &apos;re taking her into the o.r.
in case something happens , we &apos;ll be ready .
what ? no one &apos;s coming today .
doug -- - no ! it &apos;s too soon !
they -- they need more time , right ?
please . do something .
i am .
i can start her on medication to stop the labor
and i can temporarily sew her cervix closed ,
and that might give us enough time .
might ?
labor &apos;s like a boulder rolling down a hill .
once it starts , it &apos;s hard to stop .
but you &apos;re stopping the boulder .
i am .
i am trying to stop the boulder .
he doesn &apos;t remember me at all ?
a brain injury of this nature ,
it &apos;s not uncommon for some memory loss to have occurred .
we &apos;ve been together 11 years .
he wanted a divorce , but she wouldn &apos;t --
can i talk to him ?
help him remember me ?
he &apos;s still confused and agitated .
he &apos;s asking for --
it &apos;s best if you wait out here .
her ?
i took up with that lady ? why ?
because you &apos;re a stupid son of a bitch , that &apos;s why .
heart rate &apos;s looking good .
wait , why would i take up with her when i have you ?
my wife .
you are the funniest .
she is .
she &apos;s the funniest gal i &apos;ve ever met .
and you got the softest hands .
it &apos;s soft as a rabbit &apos;s foot i had when i was --
uh , griffin . stop .
go on . feel them .
i @-@ i &apos;ll take your word for it .
eh , suit yourself . you &apos;re missing out .
what happened , bugs ?
what did i do ?
uh , we fought . a lot .
about money .
oh , i don &apos;t care about money .
yeah , well , you didn &apos;t when we met ,
but you &apos;ve done very well for yourself .
what did i do , bugs ?
why would i ever hurt you ?
oh , i &apos;ve been asking you that for decades .
dumbass .
it &apos;s like a time machine .
i &apos;m good here . you can go .
and magnesium &apos;s up .
okay , courtney . we &apos;re gonna wait
and see if this medication calms everybody down .
and what do i do ? just lie here ?
yeah , and try to relax .
with four babies trying to get over the wall ?
and i still have 73 tax returns ?
well , i said &quot; try . &quot;
contractions increasing .
can i ask you something ?
if a couple &apos;s been married for three years ,
why not file jointly ?
warren .
i &apos;m just ...
no , no .
it &apos;s okay .
well , that &apos;s not the problem .
you guys have a pretty significant earnings disparity .
well , i -- i don &apos;t know if i &apos;d call it &quot; significant . &quot;
it &apos;s more than 200 % .
a little more than that .
her income increase is raising your tax bill by a lot .
this is relaxing me .
honestly , she shouldn &apos;t even be filing as an individual .
she should incorporate .
page kepner .
tell her to meet me in exam room five .
i will be back .
do not take your eyes off of these monitors .
if there is any change in any of them , you get me back here .
ooh , theres &apos; another option .
you could both file as single individuals .
well , how &apos;s that ?
you could do what some of my clients have done .
you could get divorced .
why would we
for the taxes .
grey still ignores me .
gross , gross , gross .
she refuses to fill me in on her patients .
you can &apos;t restart mrs. wheeler on tube feeds yet .
she had high residuals last time .
crap . i thought her ileus was resolved . crap !
you know , this is urine .
i &apos;ve been urinated on three times today .
what did you expect from babies ?
i &apos;m talking about puppies -- dogs .
there are puppies upstairs with the kids .
why aren &apos;t we up there right now ?
because the only thing
worse than peds is peds with puppies
because we &apos;re surgeons , not veterinarians ,
because we should not be urinated upon .
i &apos;m being crapped on .
you have to help me with shepherd .
shepherd wants me dead .
at least she knows who you are .
grey keeps calling me your name .
that doesn &apos;t even sound new .
being kicked out bed was
almost better because then she would see me --
jo .
she &apos;d have to see my face to slam a door in it .
all right , you get 10 more seconds .
what ?
you get 10 seconds to complain about meredith grey .
after that , you &apos;re done .
no more talking about it again , ever .
this is an excellent plan .
how is this fair ?
you talk and you talk about grey ,
but you don &apos;t do anything to change the situation .
you get 10 seconds .
after that ,
the only person you can talk to about meredith grey
is meredith grey .
i can &apos;t say it all in 10 seconds .
no , &apos; cause you have 7 .
what am i supposed to say to her ?
she &apos;s the head of -- - 5 .
a friend would listen . a friend would not --
time .
never again .
can i just say one more --
ever .
hey . i got your page . what do you need ?
do you trust me ?
arizona , i am swamped , and --
i mean , i &apos;m the only one that you ever told ,
so do you trust me ?
yes , of course . i trust you .
i can feel the boulder starting to roll ,
and i need to stop it .
so if you trust me , then let me help you .
and you have to let me help you my way .
which means that you need to tell jackson .
and you need to let me give you a full work @-@ up .
you &apos;re acting like i &apos;m not taking care of myself ,
but i am a doctor .
i &apos;m not stupid .
i &apos;m just not interested in getting certain tests .
i don &apos;t want you going
through what you went through last time , april .
i &apos;m not worried about me .
i am ! and i am trying - to help you get what you want ,
which is a healthy baby .
one that &apos;s not gonna go through horrible pain .
isn &apos;t that what you want ?
dr. robbins .
not now , deluca .
dr. warren sent me . it &apos;s courtney .
oh , thank god you &apos;re back .
you say her contractions are more regular ?
yeah , and baby c is getting -- - charles .
charles is showing recurrent decels .
okay , courtney .
i think that charles is still trying to make a break for it .
what ? how do you know ?
because i &apos;m holding his feet .
how could she not know she was birthing a baby ?
it &apos;s a quad at 23 weeks .
he &apos;s about the size of your hand .
quads . one litter to another .
peds is weird .
we &apos;ll need at least two full nicu teams
down here for the transport .
okay .
i &apos;m just saying . i have done our taxes every year .
why change it up now ?
there was never a reason until now .
things changed this year .
no , one thing changed this year , miranda .
one thing -- your job !
it was a pretty big change .
i need warmers and neonatal resuscitation trays ,
and if you don &apos;t have to be in here , get out .
it &apos;s about to get crowded .
hi , courtney . my name &apos;s dr. karev .
you &apos;re the out guy .
we met you during our tour of the nicu .
i am , and i can assure you ,
we &apos;re gonna do everything we can --
no , no , no . don &apos;t you talk to me .
dr. robbins talks to me .
dr. robbins is the &quot; in &quot; guy . she &apos;s the one .
these babies are staying in .
dr. robbins is &quot; in . &quot;
you &apos;re keeping them in , right ?
it &apos;s charles , right ?
courtney , charles already made up his mind .
he &apos;s partially out , and once he &apos;s completely out ,
they all come out .
dr. robbins . promise me - that they &apos;re gonna survive ,
that they &apos;ll live once their out .
all four babies .
i need four umbilical line set @-@ ups .
warren . wait .
just one .
i &apos;m sorry ?
i said one set @-@ up ! go .
what are you doing ?
i &apos;m stopping the boulder !
heading up to check on mccoll &apos;s vitals .
make sure blake &apos;s watching monitors .
what is blake &apos;s problem ?
what don &apos;t you like about her ?
she seems on top of it to me ,
so what am i not seeing ?
she &apos;s -- no , she &apos;s --
i &apos;m the new guy .
so if she &apos;s the dead fish , i &apos;d like to know .
it &apos;s personal between her and me .
you can form your own conclusions .
aww . that &apos;s kind of you . must be nice for blake .
what does that mean ?
oh , come on . you and hunt are obviously pretty tight .
i &apos;m sure you &apos;ve formed some conclusions about me .
we should go to the steakhouse we went to after our honeymoon .
that place isn &apos;t even there anymore .
i &apos;m sorry , guys . can i get in here a second , please ?
what &apos;s -- something wrong ?
mr. mccoll , can you squeeze my hands as hard as you can , okay ?
follow the light .
blake , what is it ?
page shepherd immediately .
his icp is climbing .
he needs a ventriculostomy , stat .
start a ketamine drip and grab an intubation kit .
what is going on ?
ma &apos;am , we are going to help him , but i need you outside .
have you ever done a ventriculostomy ?
yes , but i &apos;m not supposed to touch him , so
can you do one ?
i &apos;m not supposed to touch him .
you &apos;re the neurosurgeon on call .
shepherd said no , so i &apos;m not gonna drill a hole in his head .
would you please just do it ?
you &apos;re running out of time , blake .
so i &apos;m gonna deliver charles ,
i &apos;m gonna stop labor , sew up the cervix ,
and then leave the rest of the three inside
for delayed delivery .
that &apos;s impossible .
yes .
once charles is out ,
she &apos;ll keep having contractions to deliver the placenta .
they &apos;ll all deliver . it &apos;s how it works .
okay , fine . fine , great .
then i don &apos;t deliver charles &apos; placenta .
after i cut the cord , i sterilize it .
i put it back inside , and we put mom on antibiotics .
do you know how dangerous that is ?
if that placenta stays in ,
it could cause an infection , even sepsis .
it puts mom at risk , all three babies at --
alex , i am a fetal surgeon !
i know more about this than you do .
i know exactly how they can die .
have you done this before ?
has nicole herman ?
no .
i -- i don &apos;t know that anyone has .
oh , robbins . - don &apos;t -- please stop .
stop . i know that you &apos;re gonna say no ,
and i don &apos;t want to be in a position where i go against you .
i know that this is a judgment call ,
but your judgment is not better here .
i know what has to be done ,
and this is the only way that i know how to do it .
okay , what i was going to say ...
good luck .
y @-@ you &apos;re gonna let her --
i &apos;m gonna let her do what she &apos;s here to do .
and i suggest you do the same .
what are you doing ?
his icp was through the roof .
evidence of herniation . he needed a burr hole to --
relieve the pressure . don &apos;t tell me what a ventric is .
why would you let her do this ?
&apos;cause she caught it .
and she could .
get out of my way . get away from him .
ventriculostomy catheter .
did you prep for the egd ?
no . i prepped for a colonoscopy .
when you said scope , i assumed that that &apos;s --
but i don &apos;t need you to assume anything .
never mind .
blake knew we were checking for an upper g.i. bleed . it &apos;s just -
i &apos;m sorry . let me go and -- - it &apos;s fine .
you &apos;re just not blake ,
and so let &apos;s prep for the egd and page me when we &apos;re ready .

it &apos;s not for me . it &apos;s for you .
i think you &apos;d like to know what happens when you &apos;re not here .
edwards says you like that .
just -- suction .
i was tracking his vitals .
he was bradying down slowly and becoming hypotensive .
he had a dilated pupil .
all classic signs of raised intracranial pressure .
i knew that he need the ventric ,
so i asked dr. riggs to prepare it .
he thought i was qualified . i knew i was qualified .
suction . more .
then what ?
i used your craniometric method for the drilling site ...
... prepared it adequately .
i identified kocher &apos;s point at 11 centimeters , then ...
all right , betadine .
more .
just pour the entire bottle on the cord .
karev , how are we doing back there ?

which is something for his size , so ...
so we got all four .

thank god .
how &apos;s courtney ?
she &apos;s stable .
she &apos;s back in her room with three fetal heartbeats .
it &apos;ll be day to day to see if it works , but --
well , even just a day or two more inside
will help the other three .
yeah .
look , you know i didn &apos;t agree with the whole thing .
i didn &apos;t think it would work , but --
hmm . karev .
are you trying to give me a compliment ?
i &apos;m saying no one else could have done what you did .
did you talk to kepner ?
i tried .
i just -- i don &apos;t -- - i don &apos;t think that she hears me .
we --

um , robbins has requested you for her service
for the foreseeable future .
apparently , you &apos;re really good with the moms .
yeah , i &apos;m not .
i just did what robbins --
no , you helped that woman
through the scariest hours of her life .
i did , didn &apos;t i ?
yes , you did .
and you got us a new accountant .
wait , what ?
i hired courtney to do our taxes for us .
&apos;cause , you know , - so many things have changed ,
and , um , we &apos;re both so busy and --
well , you &apos;re a resident , and --
you &apos;re the chief .
i am .
are you okay with that ?
i just , um ...

yeah , see you at home .
i &apos;m -- i &apos;m sorry . what are we doing here ?
you got to tell him .
if he figures it out , sooner or later -- - god .
look , he &apos;s gonna hear it from someone else .
look , i &apos;m just saying the longer you wait ,
the worse it &apos;s gonna be .
and you got to listen to robbins .
wow . you and arizona .
y @-@ you &apos;re a great team .
well , we just want --
no , it &apos;s sweet .
thank you .
really . you &apos;re so invested .
you &apos;re like the supreme court
just trying to tell a woman what she can and can &apos;t do .
i don &apos;t want to see you guys get hurt again .
well , neither do i !
i &apos;m not telling him because we have been through enough .
especially him .
because he never got over the last one .
he never had the chance to , and i am hanging on
to every last shred of faith i have
that this time , it &apos;ll be okay .
but he doesn &apos;t have that .
so it &apos;ll just be better if he doesn &apos;t know yet .
it won &apos;t . you &apos;re making it worse .
you &apos;re right .
i am hard on you .
alex hasn &apos;t had it easy .
everyone he &apos;s ever been with has run away or stolen his job
or gone crazy or broken his heart .
none of them stick .
and he doesn &apos;t deserve to take another hit .
but the point is ,
i -- i am sorry for -- for squashing you like a bug
or whatever it is that i do .
thank you .
but , you know , you are what you allow .
and if you let them pluck off your shiny little insect wings ,
they will .
um ... okay .
so don &apos;t let them . don &apos;t let me .
understood ?
yeah .
and for the record , wilson ...
i am rooting for you to stick .
hey .
are we not going ?
i &apos;m sorry .
i have not had a chance to change .
this day .
we &apos;re canceling .
no . no . i --
i just -- i lost a patient .
and his wife lost him , too .
was it riggs ? did he do something --
no .
no , riggs was great .
i can see why you liked him .
it was blake .
blake lost your patient ?
not at all .
blake has microscope hands ...
a level head ...
more assured in the o.r. than any resident i have ever seen .
she &apos;s a natural neurosurgeon .
and now i have to teach her .
i owe it to her ... to teach her .
dinner &apos;s off .
no . no . owen , i can rally .
no . no .
it is off .
come with me .
come on .
you know , i really don &apos;t like surprises .
you &apos;ll like this one .
excuse me , can we get five minutes before you leave ?
yeah .
five minutes ? for what , exactly ?
come on . let &apos;s go . -
studies have shown that petting a dog
can actually lower blood pressure .
owen .
and they make a really crappy day a lot less crappy .
affection , acceptance ,
and unconditional love .
we all want it .
we all look for it .
nice night .
see , right about now ,
you &apos;re thinking i &apos;m some kind of stalker .
yeah , i &apos;ve called . and i &apos;ve texted .
because i wanted to see you again .
and i thought i &apos;d ask you out ,
but i can &apos;t do that if you don &apos;t call me back .
i thought i &apos;d show up here , ask you .
that way , - if you wanted to turn me down ,
you &apos;d have to do it in person .
looking at my very nice face makes it hard to say no .
so , what do you say , dr. grey ?
would you like to go out with me ?
but when we find it ...
... it &apos;s flat @-@ out terrifying .
um , have you seen dr. avery ?
upstairs in the lab .
because just as quickly as we may have found it ...
... it can disappear .
jackson , can we --
and we &apos;re back out there in the cold .
why is she telling me this ?
alone .
