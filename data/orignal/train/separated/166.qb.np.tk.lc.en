gossip girl here--
your once and only source into the
scandalous lives of manhattan &apos;slite .
i like to date more than one person at once .
you &apos;re free to see other people , too .
did you hire someone to look into my past ?
do you have a lily bass dossier ?
lily ...
i want to see it .
i won &apos;t put my name on a piece of paper
condoning who you &apos;ve become .
then i &apos;ll just have to find another way .
well , you have one other option .
you could file a suit to become emancipated .
you mean divorce my parents ?
the captain is being charged with embezzlement and fraud .
you &apos;re skipping town ?
i &apos;m gonna be a much better father to you
from dominica than i will be from jail .
for the rest of the country , thanksgiving is when families
come together to give thanks , but on the upper east side ,
the holiday thankfully returns to its roots--
lying , manipulation and betrayal .
and from what we hear , just like the indians ,
someone else is being pushed out of their home .
not only are cyrus &apos; moving boxes everywhere ,
but so are his annoying relatives .
but they can &apos;t be that bad .
aaron always talks about his nana .
oh , sylvia ? you know , she kissed me on the cheek .
she left a big , orange lipstick mark .
it looked like i &apos;d been spray @-@ tanned .
and cyrus &apos; nephew spent the morning talking to me
about corn , grain of the future .
and his sister asked me to go shopping with her .
oh , that &apos;s sweet. at century 21 .
ugh. the horror .
but even though daddy isn &apos;t coming ,
i &apos;m determined to have
the perfect thanksgiving i didn &apos;t get last year .
you &apos;re still gonna help me make his famous pie tomorrow ?
yeah , but i can only stay for a couple hours .
aaron is coming to meet my family before thanksgiving dinner .
and how do you plan to introduce him ?
&quot; mom , you d.v.r. &apos; big love . &apos; this is aaron ,
&quot; and he &apos;s just like bill paxton ,
only younger and with scruff . &quot;
i &apos;m serious. the serena i know would never want to share
a guy she really liked with anyone else .
well , i &apos;ll admit , it &apos;s been hard .
i @-@ i like him enough that i don &apos;t want to date anyone else .
and you can &apos;t get the prize if you don &apos;t compete , right ?
there &apos;s so many things wrong with that sentence .
here comes your ghost of boyfriends past to haunt me .
please try to be civil .
okay. pfft .
hey , have either of you seen jenny ? oh , if she &apos;s hiding from you ,
she has better taste than i thought . i tried .
my dad has been calling her cell ,
and he &apos;s been trying her friend agnes &apos; place ,
and she &apos;s just not returning any of his messages .
i was looking for eric .
um , the headmaster said he left early , so ...
well , she has been spending
a lot of time with him over at the apartment .
look , if you see her , could you please just tell her to call us back ,
because i would love this cold war of theirs to end before the holidays .
speaking of , happy thanksgiving .
you , too .
i &apos;m gonna miss your dad &apos;s mashed potatoes , but not the drama .
yeah , well , this year &apos;s gonna be a little quieter , i guess ,
especially if jenny doesn &apos;t show .
uh , i @-@ i guess i &apos;ll see you after the break. yeah. bye .
bye .
oh , sorry .
not as sorry as i am .
archibald , i haven &apos;t seen you around here lately .
why do you care ?
oh , i don &apos;t. if you &apos;re not with the humphreys anymore ,
obviously things are looking up , which is too bad .
i kind of liked watching you slum it .
i thought it would teach you who your real friends were .
well , i guess it has .
i need to be sure you understand what emancipation means .
i do . i &apos;ve been researching it .
she &apos;s made me watch &quot; irreconcilable differences , &quot;
like , 15 times .
once you file , the state opens up
an investigation into your family .
there has to be proof of parental neglect .
just fill out these papers authorizing the investigation .
once you sign them , your parents will be notified .
wait. they have to be notified ?
well , of course .
they need to know you no longer want to be their child .
okay. thank you .
let &apos;s go .
so what are you doing for your holiday ?
i decided to pass
on joining my family at the washoe reservation ,
where they &apos;re helping to stage a protest .
and my plan is to hole myself up in my studio ,
rent &quot; berlin alexanderplatz &quot;
and eat a frozen annie &apos;s organic turkey dinner .
oh ! well , god , you know , no one enjoys a 16 @-@ hour german movie
more than yours truly , but , uh , you could come here instead .
i don &apos;t really feel like seeing jenny .
well , i &apos;m pretty sure she &apos;s not coming ,
so you can take her chair . i didn &apos;t realize it was still that bad
between her and your dad .
where is she having thanksgiving ? with nate ?
no , uh , nate and jenny aren &apos;t spending time together anymore .
uh , so how about it ?
a fassbinder and freezer @-@ free thanksgiving at my place ?
well , when you put it that way ...
i know .
agnes &apos; mother just told me that agnes is
on a modeling assignment in tokyo ,
and she hasn &apos;t seen jenny for a week. then where is she ?
i don &apos;t know . i think i have to call the cops .
you know , uh , when i asked serena this afternoon ,
she said that jenny &apos;s
been spending a lot of time with eric .
eric ! serena ! charles ! we &apos;re home !
so much for coming home a day early .
we should have stayed on necker island .
right .
with dick and bono. right ?
is my daughter there ?
well , rufus , hello to you , too .
no , no one &apos;s here. why would you think your daughter would be ?
is she with eric ? well , i certainly hope so .
i &apos;m pretty sure she &apos;s been with him all week .
what do you mean , all week ?
what , you don &apos;t really believe she &apos;s been staying ...
i &apos;m gonna call you right back .
it was nice of the roths to let us stay at their place
while they &apos;re in aspen .
very. if they hadn &apos;t offered to help ,
i &apos;m not sure what we would have done .
we don &apos;t have a lot of options left , nate .
yeah , i kind of noticed .
but i &apos;m hoping that is about to change .
son , i missed you so much .
just like nate archibald ,
gossip girl has a family waiting for her today ,
so although i &apos;d love to stay and chat ,
i &apos;m signing off until after thanksgiving dinner--
just in time for pie , coffee and surveying the damage .
my life in dominica is ... well , it &apos;s good .
we moved some money offshore before i left ,
enough to get a house on the ocean .
weather &apos;s always perfect. people are nice .
i &apos;m so happy you &apos;re living it up in the caribbean
while we &apos;re squatting with no heat in new york .
hear your father out , nate .
i want to make things better .
i know how hard your life has been because of what i did .
i can &apos;t turn back the clock ,
but i can ask you to come live with me .
all the money in the world isn &apos;t worth it
without the two of you to share it with .
mom , did you know about this ?
yes , and i &apos;d like to go ,
but only if you want to come , too .
please , nate .
we can be a family again .
all you have to do is say yes .
i didn &apos;t know she was there until today .
i called serena. she didn &apos;t even know .
eric must have been sneaking her in at night .
let &apos;s just go wait for her .
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s such a good idea .
the last time i saw you and jenny together ,
it didn &apos;t go very well , and you don &apos;t seem to have
changed your mind about anything .
she &apos;s my daughter .
if i want to see her , you &apos;re not gonna change my mind .
i &apos;m not trying to .
it &apos;s just that i haven &apos;t seen jenny yet .
let me talk to her , see where her head is at .
if there &apos;s one thing i have learned about teenage girls ,
is that sometimes they need someone
outside of their family to talk to .
a @-@ all that might be ue , but it &apos;s thanksgiving .
jenny needs to be with family .
she is. she &apos;s with mine .
once you &apos;ve calmed down , and she &apos;s ready to talk ,
i &apos;ll arrange a meeting .
marshmallows .
jenny likes &apos; em on her , uh , sweet potatoes .
i &apos;m so glad to have the house to myself .
cyrus took my mother to jean @-@ georges for dinner .
god knows why. where &apos;s warren jeffs ?
he &apos;s , um , making dinner for us ,
which would be completely romantic and amazing ,
except when i asked him where he was today ,
he said he was hanging out with a friend .
i know i &apos;m probably being completely neurotic ,
but ali could think of was , was this friend a girl ,
a girl he kisses ?
a woman needs to be with a man who thinks of only her .
anything else is a nonstarter. tell him how you feel .
dorota , more flour .
are you baking already ?
i thought we were supposed to do that tomorrow .
i needed a little tradition of my own to keep me grounded .
it turns out the rose family has a restaurant thanksgiving .
you know , b . , the thing about traditions is
you can make new ones. for all you know ,
you could like his family dinner
more than your own.- ready .
oh. that &apos;s-- that &apos;s my cue to go .
remember , serena doesn &apos;t share .
remember , blair should learn to .
bart , you &apos;re home early .
so are you .
chuck said he thought you were
going out with jonathan tonight .
yeah , so did i. huh .
jenny : they &apos;re home early.don &apos;t come up !
so how were things while we were away ?
not so good .
i don &apos;t think it &apos;s working out with jonathan .
what do you know about someone
at your school named ben shurn ?
um , he &apos;s the , uh ,
the--the captain of jonathan &apos;s swim team. why ?
just ... maybe you might want to ask jonathan
what he was doing monday night .
you &apos;re home .
my plans for the evening got held up at customs .
your dad just insinuated
that jonathan might be dating someone else .
how and why would he know that ?
he has a p.i. on retainer , like i do .
i get that for business ,
but for family and friends of family , it &apos;s just creepy .
not to worry. bart &apos;s people are top @-@ notch and very discreet .
at our old place , he had this safe with files on everybody ,
from staff to senators .
when i was 13 , i found the most
amazing surveillance photos
of gina , my hot italian au pair .
those photos--and gina-- changed my life .
yeah , but what if i don &apos;t want my life to change ?
what else does he know ?
how much do you want to find out ?
this is so good .
but candles and home cooking ?
what &apos;s with the romance ?
bound to give the girl the wrong idea .
well , or the right one .
i &apos;ve had an incredible time with you these past few weeks .
honestly , uh , you &apos;re all i ever think of .
really ?
oh . i mean , that &apos;s flattering .
you &apos;re , of course , welcome to see other people .
that &apos;s your choice .
but , uh , as of right now , this moment ,
i &apos;m officially a 1 @-@ woman man .
wow. a 1 @-@ woman man ?
if--if i would have known we were celebrating ,
i would have brought a bottle of champagne .
well , actually , i &apos;m-- i &apos;m kind of glad you didn &apos;t .
um , i also wanted to talk to you
about the fact that , uh , i &apos;m sober .
oh . i feel a lot better .
my--my work is a lot better since i stopped drinking .
i just need to be around people that are gonna keep me
on the right track , not tempt me over to the dark side .
the dark side. right .
well , i used to party ...
every now and then .
no. no. but that-- that was so long ago .
so it &apos;s--it &apos;s , you know ,
e @-@ except for the occasional celebratory glass of champagne ,
i , um , i &apos;m pretty much a teetotaler now .
so you can count on me .
i &apos;m--i &apos;m--i &apos;m the right girl for the job .
well , i @-@ i figured .
the kids need to tell us things when they happen ,
not after they get caught. the only way to protect them is
to know what they &apos;re up to at all times. don &apos;t you agree ?
yes , but ithis case , it &apos;s complicated .
well , i certainly hope you grounded eric .
well , not yet , but-- where are you off to ?
uh , i just have to get to--
to go find jenny and tell her that we know
she &apos;s been staying here ?
how about you bring her back here ?
because i would love to talk to her .
blair , this is delicious .
i must get the recipe. but you know what ?
the ratio of cinnamon to nutmeg--not enough .
mother ?
yes ?
why are you letting cyrus ruin everything ?
it &apos;s all about his family and his traditions
and his notes on my pie .
oh , honey , calm down .
you know , you always think the--the worst of people .
cyrus made reservations for dinner
at your favorite restaurant , the gramercy tavern .
so he &apos;s having the chef make your favorite recipes--
oyster stuffing that you like .
that &apos;s not the point , mother. the point is
that thanksgiving is a family holiday ,
and this is our family now .
now you get with the program , and fast .
i hope there &apos;s some of that pie left for me .
is there ? huh ? oh ! oh !
gimme. mmm !
dorota , everything &apos;s awful .
i know thing you want to know , miss blair ,
but i not supposed to tell .
who do you work for ? spill it .
your mother make me keep this safe until tomorrow .
keep what safe ?
mr. rose propose this evening at dinner .
they be telling everyone at thanksgiving ,
when whole family is there .
i saw your father today .
yeah , i had a feeling .
i know you both need some time ,
so i @-@ i convinced him to let you stay here for a while .
and when you &apos;re ready , i would love to help you talk to him
and make things right .
thanks for the offer . i really--i appreciate it ,
but , um , you don &apos;t know how he &apos;s been , so ...
jenny , he &apos;s your father ,
and he loves you so much .
and at least for the next couple years ,
you belong at home with him .
thank you , mrs. bass ,
for letting me stay here and everything ,
but i &apos;m pretty tired , so i &apos;m ...
okay , well , get some rest .
we can talk some more tomorrow .
oh , jenny ...
so you &apos;re okay with it , jenny not being with us tonight ?
if , uh , by &quot; okay , &quot; you mean extraordinarily depressed ,
then yes . i miss her a lot .
you know , in the all arguments you two have been having ,
i haven &apos;t once heard you tell her that .
oh , my god. you &apos;re right .
it &apos;s not that rare , is it ?
aaron , what are you doing here ?
uh , i live right around the corner .
i &apos;m just picking something up to take to , um ...
oh , no . it &apos;s--it &apos;s all right . i can hear her name .
serena &apos;s .
uh , you know what ?
i &apos;m just gonna go and see if there are any pecans left .
so , um , you know , could you do me a favor
and say hi to serena &apos;s family for me ?
&apos;cause we all spent last thanksgiving together .
yeah , ablutely .
except bart , actually .
there was this , uh , this crazy thing with , uh ,
with my dad and her mom
and my mom , and it was , i guess ,
like all things in serena &apos;s life , it &apos;s very complicated .
serena &apos;s life is complicated ?
uh , well , yeah. i @-@ i don &apos;t know about you ,
but the serena i know has long , flowing blonde hair ,
towers over both of us . is--is that the same one ?
i just don &apos;t see her as complicated .
so would you say that they &apos;re
cheddar people or more goaty ?
oh , serena &apos;s something goat but cheese .
i think you might want to go with the , uh ,
wines of southern ... france .
well , i guess you don &apos;t know her as well as you think you do .
she doesn &apos;t drink anymore .
oh , sure . i mean , not problematically , of course .
i mean , at least not for months .
wait . months ?
yeah , well , y @-@ you know , the thing in the spring
with georgina ? you two are getting serious .
i &apos;m sure you guys talked about that .
yeah. yeah , yeah , absolutely .
uh , i &apos;m , uh , i &apos;m gonna go pay for this .
mother . is there anything you want to tell me ?
oh , yes , actually , there is ,
and i will tell you tonight at the restaurant
once everyone is assembled for dinner .
of all the things you &apos;ve done , mother ,
this is one of the worst . i &apos;m your daughter .
lumping me in with everyone else to hear the news ?
i don &apos;t know what news you are referring to , blair .
now if you &apos;ll excuse me , i have to go check
the reservations for dinner .
dorota , get it together. we &apos;re leaving .
if i &apos;m just like anyone else to her ,
doubt she &apos;ll notice i &apos;m not at dinner .
but it &apos;s your favorite holiday .
not anymore .
nate ?
hey , vanessa .
i didn &apos;t expect to see anyone here .
i had some paperwork to catch up on .
i thought , it &apos;s thanksgiving .
it &apos;d be quiet . why are you here ?
oh , i borrowed this pixies box set from rufus .
i , um , i was gonna return it . i wrote a thank @-@ you note .
if you could give it to him , that &apos;d be--that &apos;d be nice .
why didn &apos;t you take it by the loft ?
well , i think dan likes me
about as much as you do right now , so ...
look , you and chuck and dan--
i &apos;ve somehow managed to alienate everyone .
if you could just give rufus the cds
and--and the thank @-@ you note , i &apos;d really appreciate that .
of course .
and , vanessa , listen. uh ...
take care of yourself .
all right ?
my new boyfriend aaron
is on his way here to meet everyone ,
and i want your word on something .
if you &apos;re talking about the dress , i say &quot; higher . &quot;
chuck , i want you word that you will not mention anything
about the girl i used to be .
i just got aaron to myself ,
and if the one thing i have to do to keep it that way
is hide my recent history for a while ,
then that &apos;s what i &apos;m gonna do .
i get it. you lied to him .
n--no , i didn &apos;t .
i merely chose not to tell him everything i ever did .
and it will come out naturally , over the course
of the many conversations we &apos;re gonna have ,
as we &apos;re dating exclusively .
you have my word , whatever that &apos;s worth .
where are you going ?
eric &apos;s waiting for me in my father &apos;s study .
we &apos;re having a business meeting .
oh , my god ! you &apos;re here !
hey .
&quot; hey &quot; --that was so not on the same level as my hi .
uh , i bumped into dan at the store .
uh , he just said something . i &apos;m trying to figure it out .
figure what out ?
something about a girl named georgina ?
what ?
what--what &apos;s , um , he even talking about ?
that &apos;s , uh ,
gosh. um ...
well , you know , he &apos;s-- he &apos;s probably just jealous .
yeah. yeah , i mean , he was talking a lot about
thanksgiving last year when you two were together , so ...
yeah. well , i guess he &apos;s just not as over me
as i thought he was. but--but seriously ,
aaron , the next time he starts to tell you stories about me--
no , no , no , no. never again. no , it &apos;s not gonna happen again .
could you ?
yeah .
oh , it , uh , says &quot; lily . &quot;
what &apos;s going on ? is something wrong ?
i &apos;ve been grappling with what to do all day--
what to say , which one of you to talk to first .
is jenny okay ?
yes , but you might not be .
i know it is thanksgiving ,
but i think you should get here right away .
lily ?
i will see you soon .
come on. we &apos;re going .
vanessa &apos;s coming over .
call and cancel .
vanessa abrams .
can i help you ?
i &apos;d like to talk to you about nate archibald .
are you going to open it ?
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;ll tell you the combination .
8 @-@ 7 @-@ 69-- my mother &apos;s birthday .
it &apos;s like the end of every heist movie ever made .
are those gold bars ? i didn &apos;t think they actually made those .
is that-- is that a sat phone ?
encryption. government prototype .
put it back .
i knew you &apos;d come back for more .
chuck , you know how hard this call was for me to make . i &apos;m listening .
the fbi just came to see me , and nate &apos;s in trouble .
tell someone who cares .
chuck , this is serious. he needs our help .
where are you ?
the gallery .
sorry , kid . i have to do something .
yeah. happy hunting .
okay .
don &apos;t you dare answer that blackberry , dorota .
but it &apos;s your mother , and it &apos;s thanksgiving .
and we have nothing to be thankful for .
this is the worst thanksgiving of all time ,
and if we have to wander the upper east side
like outcasts in a jane austen novel , so be it .
maybe we can go feed ducks at boat pond
like when you were little .
fine .
i &apos;m not a monster .
i won &apos;t deny the ducks their dinner .
but if you look like you enjoy even one second of it ,
we &apos;re leaving .
oh , no. none for me , thank you .
mom .
serena , it &apos;s a special occasion. no ,
i &apos;m only 17 .
well , that &apos;s never stopped you. uh , no. no , i said no , thank you , okay ?
oh. uh , mom , have you shown aaron your beautiful art collection ?
oh , yeah. um , was that a jessica craig @-@ martin
i saw over there ? why , yes , it is , aaron. good eye .
i know. yeah , i &apos;ll--i &apos;ll be right back .
i ... my shoes are killing me .
this is crazy , jen .
these are e @-@ mails of mine , photographs ,
notes from my psychiatrist at the ostroff center .
so much for doctor / patient confidentiality , huh ?
what about serena &apos;s and your mom &apos;s ?
i can &apos;t bear to open them .
these are ... five times the size of mine .
i &apos;m sorry .
um , speaking about seeing things ,
have you seen my emancipation papers ?
because they &apos;re not in my bag ,
and i really don &apos;t want anyone to find them .
eric ? jenny ? are you two up there ?
come on downstairs. be social .
uh , yeah. we &apos;re coming .
has chuck finally decided to grace us with his presence ?
actually , um ...
what &apos;s he doing here ?
i invited him .
hi , mr. bass. daniel .
aaron , hey , man .
well , if it isn &apos;t the last person i wanted to see .
wh--i &apos;m--i &apos;m sorry ?
why &apos;d you lie about serena ?
oh , my god .
where is she ?
she should be right down .
dad ?
dan .
and aaron. hey .
what &apos;s up ?
well , your boyfriend called me a liar .
did--did--did i lie about something ?
you know , dan , maybe you and i should talk in private ,
to discuss who said what to whom
and why they felt compelled to say it ?
yeah , uh , that &apos;s-- we don &apos;t need to do that .
she &apos;s right . i lied. yeah , well , it &apos;s not cool , man .
if you have a problem with me dating your ex ,
at least be honest about it. you &apos;re right . i &apos;ll be honest .
yeah . serena , i &apos;m sorry , but i &apos;m already late
to meet my father at the waldorfs &apos; . bye .
you didn &apos;t exactly tell him the truth .
well , you didn &apos;t exactly have to .
you know , i &apos;m sorry .
i thought--i thought he knew . i really did .
well , he didn &apos;t , and he doesn &apos;t .
i &apos;m sorry .
i @-@ i panicked ,
and i was mad at you .
no , i @-@ i should have kept my mouth shut .
but really , serena ? i mean ,
you &apos;re g--you have to tell him everything .
if there &apos;s one thing that we earned this past year ...
see , around here , the truth always comes out .
uh , it just did .
you know , when you called , i thought it was an emergency .
obviously i was wrong .
it &apos;s more like an intervention .
there &apos;s someone you need to talk to .
the fbi knows that your dad &apos;s in town ,
and they think he &apos;s about to commit a crime
even worse than fraud or embezzlement .
like what ?
like extortion and kidnapping .
when your father escaped to dominica ,
he could only get his hands on enough money
to get himself set up .
he should have found a job , reinvented himself .
but instead , he lid the way he &apos;d always lived .
now he &apos;s got nothing left .
yeah , well , if my father &apos;s poor ,
what &apos;s the point of us going to live with him ?
i mean , we don &apos;t have any money .
but the vanderbilts do .
yeah , look , why would my grandparents pay us
to go live with him when they can &apos;t even help us out here ?
i mean , they hate my dad .
maybe that &apos;s why they would give him money--
to leave without you or your mom .
we &apos;ve been monitoring your father &apos;s calls .
he &apos;s trying to get in touch with your grandparents .
w @-@ well , i mean , if this is true ,
why didn &apos;t you just come tell me this yourself ?
we didn &apos;t know if you or your mother
knew what was going on .
after all , she helped him escape in the first place .
but i told him i didn &apos;t think
that you would just leave new york .
especially without saying good @-@ bye to your friends .
i &apos;ll let the three of you talk it over .
this is just too much .
there is still a chance that the captain can get away ,
if that &apos;s what you want .
but you could also end it all now .
how ?
by turning your father in .
i &apos;m sorry i didn &apos;t call you back , okay ?
a lot has been happening. agnes kicked me out .
she burned all my dresses ,
and then i had to crash with eric .
i had nowhere else to go .
and i couldn &apos;t tell anyone i was living here
because then they &apos;d tell you , and you &apos;d be really mad .
i &apos;m not . i &apos;m out of angry . miss you too much .
dad , please don &apos;t try to guilt trip me right now , okay ?
your brother helped me realize
that i haven &apos;t told you something--something important .
what ?
i love you , jenny . i love you so much ,
i &apos;m willing to let you go
if that &apos;s what it &apos;s gonna take to get you back .
and when the time comes for a court hearing ,
i won &apos;t stand in your way .
but there &apos;s nothing you can do
to make me stop loving you .
i &apos;m sorry .
dan and his father just left to look for jenny ,
so maybe now would be the perfect time for you
to tell me what the hell &apos;s been going on here today , lily .
you first .
where did you get those ?
it doesn &apos;t matter. did you read these ?
not yet .
only mine .
none of you were supposed to
find them ? i can &apos;t believe this .
you did this to me , and i dealt with it .
but the kids ? my kids ?
mom , you knew about this ?
we &apos;ll talk about that later .
i &apos;m just trying to protect them .
if you &apos;re gonna let your son and daughter
go where they please and do as they please ,
someone has to look out for them .
there &apos;s a difference between looking out for them
and treating them like criminals in their own home .
how do you expect them to trust us if we don &apos;t trust them ?
god. okay , kids , let &apos;s go .
where are you going ?
oh , well , this day is about family ,
and if you &apos;re not for this family ,
then i &apos;m gonna take mine and spend it with them .
where have you been ?
your mother &apos;s almost done packing. we have to go .
do you really think your plan &apos;s gonna work ?
well , it will if we hurry up .
come on. let &apos;s go .
no , i don &apos;t mean that. are you really planning
on holding me and mom for ransom ?
not all the money &apos;s for me , nate. it &apos;s for you guys , too .
look , this way , you and your mom
will get everything you deserve ,
and i will have enough to start over wherever i go next .
look , i want to take care of you ,
but i @-@ i don &apos;t know what else to do .
no , there &apos;s a different way to get our lives back , dad ,
one that doesn &apos;t require another felony .
the fbi are on the way here .
nate , please--
dad , listen . i love you ,
but if you can &apos;t do the right thing ,
then i can &apos;t respect you .
so the choice is yours .
you go out that service entrance
and you ruin our relationship forever ...
or you be a man
and you turn yourself in when they get here .
well , that &apos;s not a choice .
it is a choice ,
because i &apos;m sick of living in the mess
you &apos;ve created for us , and i &apos;m not gonna do it anymore .
i hope you won &apos;t either .
the annual van der woodsen diner thanksgiving dinner .
hmm. we should have a standing reservation .
i think we do .
what errand did serena have to run ?
i don &apos;t know , but she took her file with her .
maybe she went to burn it .
i don &apos;t blame her . i should have burned mine .
i lied before .
i read it .
eric , whatever you read , um--
i can &apos;t believe you didn &apos;t tell me
you were in an institution like me .
you were 19. you were just a few years older than i was ,
and after everything i went through last year ...
maybe i should have said something ,
but i wanted to be strong for you .
plus , i really wasn &apos;t ready to revisit it .
i look forward to talking about it ... when you &apos;re ready .
it takes time . i should know .
how did you get so wise ?
the nanny .
okay .
how about we have a real thanksgiving dinner ?
it &apos;s not too late .
what &apos;d you have in mind ?
well , come on .
and-- oh , serena .
i @-@ i was hoping that you were blair .
oh , why ? where is she ? maybe you can find out .
she &apos;s ignoring all our calls .
yeah. yeah. maybe she will take yours .
would you mind ?
yeah , of course .
i &apos;ll let you know as soon as i hear back from her .
thank you .
is aaron here ?
he &apos;s over there .
serena , hey .
hey. dan didn &apos;t lie . i did .
it was more of a lie of omission , but still .
i @-@ i @-@ i &apos;m sorry i didn &apos;t tell you everything .
i should have. um , read this .
if you still want to be with me after , then let me know .
she &apos;s on 5th and 71st .
oh , thank you .
happy thanksgiving .
happy thanksgiving , dear .
what are you doing ?
my dad and i got in a fight ,
i was crashing at eric &apos;s , and he finally chased me down .
you &apos;re lucky .
you have a family who fights for you .
mine doesn &apos;t even care if i &apos;m there .
well , your mom loves you in her own way , blair .
but the way your father loves you-
i never had that .
my own dad , as sweet as he is , isn &apos;t here .
your father ...
will go anywhere for you , anytime .
i know because i &apos;ve sometimes
even made it happen .
what ?
what ? is it my hair ?
no . you &apos;re just wrong .
jenny .
you look cold .
here .
come home , dear .
you &apos;ve made your point .
i don &apos;t think i have .
well , i think that you might feel differently
when you find out what i have been
waiting to show you .
i &apos;ll come ...
yes .
on one condition--
jenny has to go home , too .
well , i think that &apos;s a terrific idea .
everyone should be where they belong on
thanksgiving with their families .
now--come on . come on . come on . come on .
we &apos;ll drop you .
what &apos;s going on ?
i love you both .
i &apos;m proud of you .
no , don &apos;t .
let me .
howard , no .
what &apos;s going on ?
mam
what are you doing , howard ?
i &apos;ll be--i &apos;ll be okay .
you have the right to remain silent .
anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law
you have the right to have an attorney present
hey. we were hoping you &apos;d be here .
my mom &apos;s inside , signing papers in the dark .
we got our house back .
now all we need is some electricity .
but look , i , i can &apos;t thank you guys enough .
i &apos;m gonna give you guys a moment .
i ...
didn &apos;t want you to go .
and i don &apos;t like to admit it ,
but i still ...
still ?
it &apos;s not important .
um , there &apos;s the whole thing with jenny ,
and i don &apos;t want to get in the way of that .
vanessa , i haven &apos;t heard from jenny in weeks ,
so ... if you &apos;d like , i mean , uh ,
can we get together sometime ?
i guess that &apos;d be okay .
cool .
call me .
i will .
by the way , i &apos;m glad you stayed , too .
thanks , man .
no , let &apos;s , uh , let &apos;s get drunk instead .
daddy .
oh , sweetheart. oh !
oh , honey .
i would have come sooner .
there was a t.g.v. strike .
wait . this is the surprise ?
i thought you were getting engaged .
we are .
i @-@ i wanted your father to meet cyrus
before we told everyone .
if he didn &apos;t approve of the man
who might become your stepfather ,
i couldn &apos;t quite marry him , could i ?
well , now that the cat &apos;s out of the bag ,
i @-@ i think this calls for a celebration .
mm @-@ hmm. dessert first , i always say .
thank you , dorota .
are you hungry ?
i guess i &apos;m ready for a new tradition .
i was kind of hoping she &apos;d be here .
yeah . i was , too .
you are .
i love you , too , dad .
i don &apos;t--i don &apos;t want to not be your daughter .
guys , i can &apos;t breathe .
good .
good .
i don &apos;t need to read that .
no , i @-@ i think you do .
anything you want to tell me
you can tell me yourself .
i want to know you ,
no matter what you &apos;ve done or how long ago
anyone home ?
what &apos;re you doing here ?
i don &apos;t know . it &apos;s thanksgiving ,
and i couldn &apos;t think of anywhere
that felt more like home .
i &apos;m glad to see that you couldn &apos;t either .
e. , call serena .
i left a message already .
oh , good .
what about bart ?
not coming .
all right . dinner &apos;s way behind schedule , so
who wants to start cooking ?
i do .
hey , vanessa .
hey .
those flowers are beautiful . are they for me ?
yes .
thank you .
hi .
i &apos;m glad you &apos;re back .
i thought you were still mad at me .
i was .
look , i &apos;m really , really sorry about nate .
i mean , if it &apos;s any consolation ,
i don &apos;t think he ever really liked me anyway .
i haven &apos;t heard from him in weeks , so
our friendship is more important than
some guy , right ?
yeah
so let &apos;s just eat some turkey and
put it behind us .
okay .
i missed you .
i missed you too .
i call dibs on mashed potatoes .
hey . jen , your mail &apos;s been piling up here .
it &apos;s mostly catalogs , but still ,
you gotta sift through it .
okay .
before you get going on that ,
you care to help me
find the marshmallows ?
absolutely .
dan , you think you can handle
the cranberry sauce ?
oh , god. yes .
remember how to work that ?
as the end of another holiday draws near ,
i &apos;d like to take a moment
to list all the things i &apos;m thankful for .
i &apos;m thankful that no matter
how dark things might get ,
old friendships can still be rekindled ...
i &apos;m thankful for new relationships
that help us realize how far we &apos;ve
come from who we were ...
and how close we get
when we can really be ourselves .
i &apos;m thankful to know that no matter
what they say . you can go home again ,
whether it &apos;s your home or not .
andrew , bart bass .
i know i told you not to look into
why my wife was in that sanatorium ,
but i &apos;ve changed my mind .
i &apos;d really like to know .
i &apos;d like to know everything .
excuse me . i @-@ i have to go call my folks .
but the thing i &apos;m most thankful for ?
how even on the most giving of days ,
people can still do something unforgivable .
signed , stealed and delivered ,
