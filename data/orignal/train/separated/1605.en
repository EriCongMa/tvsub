I love you.
I love you too.
We heard from Robin. She's recommending your adoption.
You're officially a member of the Adams Foster family.
We didn't do anything wrong.
That's Joe Olsen,
The son of the owner of the S.U.V. that hit the kids.
Didn't you say the guy on the bus was black?
But if Joe lends his father's car to the guy,
hits Ana and the twins in the Volvo,
and takes off?
You have an interesting theory.
I cheated on my boyfriend. I have to live with that.
A.J.
Hey, grandma.
That's Mike. He's my new foster father.
Are you having an affair with Monte?
No, she kissed me.
Surprise.
Jesus.
I had to get a second mammogram.
They saw something in the first one.
What is it?
It's a bat signal.
Why are you sending Connor away?
Connor asked to go live with his mom.
The composer who will be performing at Disney Hall is Brandon Foster.
Oh, I'll come back.
No, it's okay. I'm just getting ready.
So, you excited?
Oh, come on. You're gonna do great.
But I know the feeling. I hate speaking in public.
Just don't forget to breathe, 'cause I actually...
I threw up last night before the concert.
You did?
Yeah.
Well, you killed it.
What, you don't think it went well?
No, no, we rocked it, for sure.
But this professor from Juilliard,
after the concert, invited me
to their final callbacks in New York.
You're kidding.
No.
Okay, so why aren't you freaking out right now?
Because I looked it up
and it's, like, 40,000 a year. And that's just tuition.
Yikes.
Yeah.
Well, we have the college fund
that grandma sharon set up for us.
That's not even gonna cover a year.
Okay, you can't worry about that right now,
'cause, you know, if you get in,
you never know what will happen.
You should go tell moms. They're gonna flip.
Hey, how's A.J.?
Sad.
I mean, other than his brother,
she was the only family he had, so...
I can't believe it's all just packed up,
Just like that. It's like she wasn't even ever here.
They need the room, you know,
for somebody else's grandma.
I talked to the funeral home
and everything's taken care of.
What?
What do you mean?
Nothing.
Just whatever your grandmother's insurance doesn't cover, I got it.
You don't have to do that.
I want to.
Thank you.
I'm gonna get this box out to the car.
Leave your name at the beep.
Hey, it's Foster. Listen,
if you haven't run the prints on that pen yet,
don't bother. The lead's dried up.
Okay? Thanks.
You look nice.
Oh, thank you.
You put that on for Monte?
Stef...
We talked about this.
You said you were okay with me going back to work.
Yes, and I... I am.
I kind of have to be, don't I?
Are you sure about that?
I am.
You remember what we said in the garage... no more half-truths.
Yes, I'm sure.
Oh my god.
What?
What?
The insurance company is refusing to pay for my second mammogram.
You are kidding me.
Well, it's only $300,
but with all of Jesus's plane tickets
and Callie and Jude's legal bills, it's just...
You know, we're starting to get a little behind, I think.
It's making my head hurt.
Hey, ma.
Good morning.
Good morning, Sharon.
Where have you been?
Oh, I was just... I was taking a walk.
This early?
Yeah, you know,
I'm just... I'm still on east coast time.
And in your slippers? That's interesting.
No, I just... I forgot my comfy shoes.
Relax, Columbo.
What are you doing?
Nothing.
What's that?
Just... it's...
The insurance company doesn't want to pay for my mammogram.
What? Why not?
Well, because I already had one, and they wanted to re-image.
But that is fine. Everything's fine. I'm fine.
Please don't make a big deal out of it. Here we go.
Wait a minute, sister. Listen, you need a second opinion.
No, it was a second opinion, mom.
That was, so...
Did you talk to the radiologist?
No, I didn't, but you know how it goes.
They read the thing, and then the tech comes in and tells you
that you're fine. And I am. I'm fine. I'm just fine.
No, no.
No, no, what?
Stef, we need to talk about this.
No, there's nothing to talk about, mom.
Please.
No need to go through other people's mail!
You're not other people.
You're my daughter.
Do you have a minute?
Thanks you for sitting down with me.
Now that the school year's starting again,
I just thought it was important for me to apologize face to face.
I realize I've put us all in a difficult position.
Yes, you have.
I want you to know I'm not proud of what I said...
or did.
But mostly I came here to say,
if you want me to resign from anchor beach, I will.
And that is why I started Fost and Found.
So that foster kids can find valuable resources,
But more importantly, so they can find each other.
Because we all need a sense of community.
And if we ever want change to happen,
there needs to be a place to speak up,
to come forward and tell our stories...
Do you think that girl is for real?
That girl is my sister.
Trust me, she's for real.
...Even if it makes people uncomfortable or mad.
Because there's no way
they're gonna fix these problems if they don't know...
So what do you think about what Monte said?
I mean, how can we expect a bunch of lawmakers
and social workers to know what we're really going through
when they're not living our lives?
The only way real change can happen is if we demand it.
Hey, aren't you...
why aren't you in Colorado?
Oh, yeah, I'm not... I'm not going back.
Why not?
Because he's flunking out.
Mariana.
Well, aren't you?
I didn't flunk out. I was just having
kind of a hard time with the classes there.
But I'd prefer it if, you know, everybody didn't know about it.
So could you shut your trap for once?
Fine.
What are you doing?
We're making posters for my campaign.
Campaign? For what?
Junior class president. Emma's my campaign manager.
Really? Why would you want to do that?
It's so lame.
Jesus.
Junior year is, like, the most important year for colleges.
I have to totally kill it this year
if I want to get into a good school,
And not just academically. I need, like, a full resume
of extracurricular activities, so...
Oh, sorry. You were so boring, I fell asleep.
Wha...? Hi.
What the hell?
Lexi?
Ah! Hi! Oh my god.
What are you doing here? I just talked to you a couple days ago.
I'm back. We're back.
What? How?
We got our visas.
And the first thing my mom did was call your mom
to make sure that I can come back to Anchor Beach.
You're coming back?
But I made her swear to secrecy, so that I could surprise you.
Oh my god.
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.
Oh. Hey, Emma.
Wow, it's like an ex-girlfriend convention in here.
Want me to call Hayley? Maybe she can come over.
And you have to tell everyone how they're selling kids
into these privatized foster homes.
Yeah, I know about these places.
My friend Kiara was in one of them.
Then why aren't you saying anything about it?
I... I will.
But maybe you could post on "Fost and Found," get people talking?
I... I can't.
My foster family already hates me.
What if they saw it?
So have you spoken to your social worker?
She doesn't care, okay?
She works for the company.
Excuse me. I'm sorry, but I need to steal Callie for a minute.
You looked like you might need a little saving.
Thank you.
Oh, forgive me. I'm Justina Marks.
I'm a foster care advocate,
And I have a proposition I hope you're gonna like.
I have $50,000 I'd like to invest in you.
So did you guys come to a...?
Well, we spoke and...
we both have decided that it would be best if you stayed.
Really?
Yes.
But I want to be really clear:
we are not friends.
We are colleagues, nothing more.
My wife is being incredibly understanding and trusting,
and I think the least we can do
is respect appropriate boundaries.
Absolutely.
Yes, absolutely.
My dad has a meeting or something when we get back,
so now we leave a day early.
Well, that sucks.
Yeah.
Wow, you're taking everything, huh?
I'm gonna be back in a month, to see my dad.
And my mom said you can visit whenever you want.
Okay.
You know, school's not gonna be the same without you.
Nothing is.
Jude.
I'm sorry, okay?
I want to stay.
Really, I do.
But you gotta understand...
my dad... he's never gonna change.
Seen Mike?
Uh, no, he went to get coffee.
You want to get this to him for me?
Yeah, sure.
What is it?
He told me not to bother,
but I had already run the prints.
Turns out they do match the ones from the S.U.V.
So looks like maybe you got your guy.
Nice work.
What the hell is this?
Whose prints are on this pen, Mike?
From Mission Beach Elder Care, huh?
Is it A.J.'s? Is this where his grandmother is?
Is that why you were telling me to let this go? Because tell me...
No. No, Stef. It's not A.J.
It's his brother Ty.
What?
Look,
We were at the nursing home,
And this kid came up to pick up Ty.
And I thought I recognized him.
And I went over to take a closer look,
And it was Joe Olsen.
Yeah, yeah, turns out your way out theory... not so way out.
So I ran the prints on the pen that Ty used to sign in.
Wade just said that you told him not to bother.
You planning on burying this, Mike?
Look, Stef, we don't know anything for sure.
No, no, no, no, these prints match.
We have a witness who can I.D. him.
You're kidding me.
Stef...
What about A.J.? I'm just getting through to him.
He's starting to trust me.
What do you think is gonna happen
If I arrest the only family he's got left?
What about my family... our family,
All the people you love...
Jesus and Mariana, Ana, the baby?
What about all the pain they've been through, Mike?
Can we at least wait till after the funeral?
Please.
Look, it's in a few days. Nobody knows anything.
You cannot tell A.J. He's gonna tell his brother,
and he's gone, and you know it.
I'm not stupid.
Fine. I have to go.
Hey there.
So you're back, huh?
Yeah.
Can you believe it?
Remember all the times we used to make out in here?
I have no idea what you're talking about.
So you're not seeing Emma anymore?
No, no.
We ended things a long time ago.
I'm not seeing anyone...
actually.
Well, me neither.
Good to know.
Well, first of all, you two are raising
an amazing young woman here.
Thank you. We certainly think so.
And I think you're in a position to become the spokesperson
the foster community has been waiting for.
And I can get you in front of the people
who need to hear your message, and I have the resources
you're gonna need to expand "Foster and found."
This all sounds really exciting,
But this is Callie's senior year in high school.
She's really got a lot on her plate.
Do you know about Privatized Homes?
These companies are getting paid fees from the state
every time they place a child with a family.
So the more kids they place, the more money they make,
which means that some companies are,
like, pretty much taking anyone who's willing to foster.
Is there something we could do about that?
Absolutely. Absolutely.
I mean, there is so much that needs to be addressed,
but I think the most important thing for us to do right now
is to look at the big picture.
Yeah, it's just
there was this kid at the event today
who's in one of those homes.
Look, I know how hard it must be to have all these kids
reaching out to you, hearing all of their heartbreaking stories.
But, I mean, you can't trust every kid
who comes knocking at your door, asking for help.
I mean, you have to be careful.
Yeah, that's true.
I know that.
There was just something about him.
He reminded me a little bit of my brother.
Give me his name. I'll make some calls.
Uh, it was Jack Downey, I think.
I'll see what I can do.
Hey, mom.
Where are you going?
You startled me. I was just taking a walk.
Another one?
Gotta get my steps in.
So which picture should I use?
That one.
That one.
The left one, definitely.
You like someone who can really get things done.
Yeah, like put people to sleep.
I say right. You look super hot.
But I'm not your campaign manager, so...
That's right. You're not.
Yeah... no, I know.
But, you know, Lexi's just trying to help,
And I think she kind of does have a point.
We can't be boring.
I don't think smart is boring.
I don't think that caring about what matters is boring.
I don't think that you need to be silly and stupid to be sexy.
But if that's the kind of campaign that you want to run,
Then maybe I'm not the girl for the job.
I should probably get home anyway.
Talk to you later.
She's intense.
Yeah.
But she's right.
I think I should stick with Emma as my campaign manager...
Just Emma.
I'm so happy you're back,
But I think it's best
if I just have one vision, you know?
Okay.
Got it.
Sorry.
No hard feelings?
Yeah.
No, no hard feelings.
Thank you for sitting down to talk to me.
I think we could do wonderful things together, Callie.
So you'll think about what I said?
Yeah, yeah.
Okay, bye.
Bye.
Hey, I need you find out where Jack Downey's been placed.
It's important.
Mom.
Open...
Police! Open up!
I can hear you in there.
Hi, Stefanie. How are you?
What the hell is going on, mom?
Oh, this is Will...
My boyfriend.
What's up?
I mean really, what's going on mom?
Why on earth would you not want to introduce us to your boyfriend?
I mean it's not that serious, really.
It's just you know, kind of a fling,
because you know he's young.
I'm not buying that, mom.
I mean, you didn't want us to meet him
because he's young and hot?
Wait he's not homophobic, is he?
He'd better not be homophobic.
Don't be ridiculous, of course not.
I would never even date somebody...
I would hope not.
Who wouldn't like you because you're a lesbian.
Actually I was a little afraid
that he might like you because you're a cop.
What?
Well he's just, he's not a fan of big government,
or a big fan of government period.
He's just...
Wow, my mother's dating an anarchist.
That's brilliant.
What can I tell you?
You know the heart wants what it wants, and the sex is just...
Oh mom I don't want to hear it.
You're such a prude really.
You raised me. Please help me.
We need to make a decision about Jesus.
What do you think?
I don't know. I'm not what do we do, you know?
Do we let him stay home because he's homesick?
Yes, you should let him stay.
Mother, I didn't ask you.
I'm just saying.
Of course I feel for him,
but I think that we should make him go back,
honor his commitment.
Yeah, that's not gonna work.
So you're flunking out huh?
I'm gonna kill Mariana.
I... I guess I was just embarrassed, you know?
I didn't want you guys to be ashamed of me.
Well, that makes sense.
Yeah.
Except for the fact that after we spoke with Mariana,
I called Flintwood. They said you're doing fine.
Better than fine, actually.
So what the hell is going on?
I didn't want to tell you guys this, but...
some of the kids on the team take steroids,
and they were pressuring me to take them too,
so we could be, you know the strongest team possible.
And these kids, they're really good,
like way better than me.
So I did it for a few days,
but I hated how they made me feel, and I stopped.
But here's the thing I can't go back
unless I want to keep taking steroids, and I don't.
The only way for me to stop is if I tell coach,
and then I'm ratting out on everyone
and the guys on the team are gonna destroy me.
Well so I guess he's going back to Anchor Beach, huh?
No, he's not.
There's a waiting list, and he's not on it.
I'm sorry about your grandma.
She seemed really cool.
Well I don't know if I'd call her cool,
but she was pretty great.
Well you still have Ty, that's good.
I'm sorry I missed your speech thing.
How did it go?
Okay I guess.
Afterwards this woman came up to me
and told me that she wants to invest in "Fost and Found,"
And she wants me to be like,
a spokesperson or something.
What does that mean?
I don't know.
I don't really think I'm cut out to be like a role model you know?
Why not?
Why can't you be a role model?
In the comic books, it's always the people
you never think could do it who turn out to be the hero.
I mean, what if Peter Parker
didn't want to be Spider-man after he got bit?
It's too bad, you know?
It's just sometimes it's meant to be,
Super Callie.
So listen, there's this comic convention next weekend.
Comicon?
No, this is smaller.
Okay.
It's more indie. It's really cool.
And I was wondering
if maybe
you wanted to go with me?
Hey, good news.
I just got a call from the Weavers.
Their son got into Hilldale prep,
and he won't be returning this year,
so there's an opening in the junior class.
There's also a waiting list,
and I just don't feel comfortable.
Look, no one will ever know.
Frankly, it's not up to you. I'm the principal.
Jesus was a student here last year,
and I'm thrilled he'll be joining us again tomorrow.
What is that kid doing here?
I invited him.
Why?
Well I mean my boyfriend is moving to L.A.,
so I figured I'd better make some new friends,
if that's okay with you.
Where have you been?
I went to see A.J.
Nice of you.
So if you and A.J. are like,
hanging out, dating or whatever,
that's... that's fine.
But can we make a deal?
If either of us starts seeing someone,
can we just tell each other, okay?
Just so we don't have to find out about it from someone else.
Okay.
Okay.
What did moms say about Juilliard?
Oh, I actually...
I haven't had the chance to tell them yet.
They're gonna be really happy for you. I promise.
Hello.
Hey, grandma.
Actually, can I ask you something?
Uh, you made a lot of money with the stock market, right?
Who wants to know?
Well, I think it's gonna be lovely, gentlemen.
I promise we're going to do right by your grandmother.
And so the only thing left to attend to
is the matter of the bill.
Uh, that's me.
Shall we...
Of course.
Should be a nice service.
Look, I know you miss her. I miss her too.
It ain't that.
What then?
I gotta go, dude. I gotta get out of here.
Soon as the funeral's over, I gotta hit the road.
Wait, hold up, why?
Look, the cops have been coming around.
What the hell did you do, Ty?
I borrowed a car from a buddy of mine,
you know, the day I was supposed to come meet you.
I got into this accident...
A bad one.
I almost killed some people,
and I just panicked and I ran.
Now the cops are coming around and asking all these questions.
I gotta go, before they start to figure everything out.
I probably should have told you before,
but I can't be hanging around.
Where... where... where was the accident?
Mission and "E."
What kind of car was it that you hit?
I don't know.
Green maybe, or blue. I took off so quick.
A Volvo, Ty? Was it a Vvolvo?
It could have been. It was like a station wagon.
Why?
Because it was the Fosters.
Those people you almost killed... it was Mariana and Jesus.
It was the family I've been staying with.
Does Mike know?
About the accident? Yeah.
But he doesn't know it was you,
or else he would have arrested your ass.
I gotta go. I gotta go tonight.
Either you're coming with me,
or you ain't never gonna see me again.
So I just... I don't know how I feel
about letting Jesus jump the line.
You know, if someone found out and made a fuss,
we could lose the charter.
But I don't think that anyone's gonna know.
And, you know, honestly, you have done so much for that school
that I think it's okay if you take a little something in return.
Listen, I had a very interesting conversation
with Brandon this afternoon.
He wanted to know if I would invest the $7,500
that he has left over from his hand money.
He did? Why?
It seems that he has been invited
for the final callbacks for Juilliard,
but he doesn't think he should even try
because he doesn't think you could possibly afford it.
Now I just didn't have the heart to tell him
that I didn't think even I could turn $7500
into $150,000 in a year.
Hello.
Yes, this is she.
I'm sorry, Dr. who's office?
I don't understand.
I never sent my mammogram over to a Dr. Kopak.
Actually, you did.
Okay, you know what? I'm so sorry.
I'm gonna have to call you back, be...
Okay.
Okay, thank you very much.
Yes.
You had the radiologist send my film over to another doctor, mom,
for a second second opinion? Really?
Maybe I did.
What?
Sharon.
How do you do that? What, they can just let anybody
send my... my... my records around town?
No, they have security questions.
They wanted to know your mother's maiden name.
Took me a second, but then I remembered.
Oh my God.
What?
Okay, just...
Honey, what did they say?
They want me to come back
for an ultrasound, and possibly a biopsy.
Oh, all right. So you'll go.
No, I'm not going.
The doctors order these tests and these biopsies
and all this stuff to make money.
It's a racket. And I am fine.
So that's the end of the conversation.
Well, I just can't decide
whether I want the lobster or the shrimp.
I think I might need a second opinion.
What do you think, Lena?
I think I'm gonna get the steak,
or crab, or both.
You're not gonna get both, Jesus, come on.
Don't be a pig. This place isn't cheap.
Don't be silly. You can have whatever you want.
I'm taking everybody to dinner tonight.
Mom, that's not necessary.
No, I want to. I want to.
We're celebrating, aren't we?
Callie's adoption
and Brandon's big debut at Disney Hall,
and also the first day of school.
Oh, yeah.
And we're also celebrating the fact
that Brandon is headed to new york to audition for Juilliard.
What?
Grandma told us what you talked to her about today.
If you get in, we'll figure it out, okay?
I just want you to focus on your audition for now, okay?
Mama, you're gonna have four kids in college soon.
It's not all about me.
I gotta figure out a way to help, at least.
Let's be honest,
the industrial-penal complex has to be fed.
What?
He said, "Penal."
We arrest them. We throw away the key.
That is what police do.
They have a role to play, and that's what it is.
What about "protect and serve"?
What about "protect and serve"?
I mean, don't even get me started about police brutality
and racial profiling.
Gosh, I am parched. Where is that waitress?
Brandon, run over to that bar
and get me a champagne cocktail.
Mom, you can't send a minor over to get an alcoholic drink.
Oh, I think he's a major.
Are you okay, bud?
Hey, I promise you're gonna see Connor again, okay?
Yeah, I know.
It just won't be the same.
I'm not sure I understand why he's going.
Because...
Because his dad just doesn't get it.
And he never will.
What can I get you?
Um, a champagne cocktail.
Um, can I see some I.D.?
Oh, it's not for me.
It's for my grandma.
Okay.
What's that for?
Oh, we used to have somebody come play happy hours,
but he was drunk all the time, so they fired him.
Too bad too. Tips were really good when he was here.
Why? You play?
A little.
Norman, this handsome dude was just asking
if we ever have anyone play that piano.
No, and we never will again.
Sorry.
Thanks.
Here you go, Grandma.
Thank you.
So does it feel different,
being adopted?
Yeah, kinda.
I finally feel safer.
Must be nice.
It is, yeah.
Honestly, the best part of it is knowing
that Jude and I aren't gonna be separated again.
What the hell is that?
It's hella good, is what it is.
Hey, so that comic thing next weekend...
I would love to go, if you still...
Yeah, yeah.
Definitely.
Will you please go get another opinion, honey?
It's for me.
Please.
You're too important to us all.
I'm sorry to bother you, but...
Look, this probably isn't my place,
but don't give up on Connor.
I'm not.
I'd never give up on my son.
He's the one that wanted to go live with his mother.
Absolutely. Of course you wouldn't do that.
What I mean to say is
don't... don't let him give up on you.
So you asked me to let you know
if there's anything going on with me and A.J..
We are going to this comic thing next weekend.
I don't know if it's, like, a friend thing or...
Okay.
Yeah, I just wanted you to know.
Thanks.
Let's go.
Okay, don't leave me.
I need your help getting to the high places.
Watch out.
Aww, hell.
I need Connor's transcripts.
I tried to get him to stay, but...
I guess it's too late.
Jude.
I just wanted to say I'm...
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry for not getting it.
Did you talk to anyone about me?
'Cause I just got taken away from my foster family
and put in a group home.
I thought you didn't like them.
I don't, but this new place sucks.
Well, I mentioned it to this woman I've been working with, but...
Well, thanks a lot.
Hey, do you want to, you know, stay
and play games or something or...?
Nah.
You guys are busy, so it's okay.
See you.
Well, I'm just thrilled
you decided to let me come onboard, Callie.
Me too.
Hey, did you ever talk to anyone about that kid Jack Downey?
Oh, no. No, I'm sorry.
I haven't had the chance to make that call yet.
You know what? You don't have to.
Don't worry about it. But thank you.
This is Mariana, my sister.
She's been helping me with all the coding for the site,
so she's gonna set up your account.
Yep, all you need to do is create a password.
Don't look.
Okay.
Done.
Awesome.
You're now officially an administrator for "Fost and Found."
The biopsy we did on your breast
shows that you have ductal carcinoma in situ.
Which is?
D.C.I.S. is the presence of abnormal cells
contained inside a milk duct in the breast.
So she... she has cancer?
She has what we call stage zero cancer.
I would recommend a lumpectomy,
possibly followed by radiation,
depending on whether we find any microinvasion in the margins.
Without a family history of breast cancer...
