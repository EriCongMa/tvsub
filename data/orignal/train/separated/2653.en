I got a job.
Boston? You're gonna move to --
We're gonna move to Boston.
I'm pregnant.
I assume Tom is the father.
I know you want to believe that our work is done,
but it's not.
I'm thinking about giving the baby up for adoption.
Why would you do that?
My life is so filled with death,
how can I bring a child into that world?
The job fell through.
Reddington.
It doesn't matter. I'll figure something else out.
I'm not a threat to your safety, Lizzy, or your child's.
But I cannot do that if you run away.
You're the only reason I need protection.
I-if you could please call me, it's about...
giving up my child.
Mr. Eriksson, so sorry for the wait.
If you'll follow me.
Happy, baby, what's wrong?
Wait outside.
No, Happy, let's just go!
No!
No!
No, Rafael, please!
That was Peter.
The Vacarros are gathering.
Listen to me.
I don't care if they see it coming.
I don't care if you send them engraved invitations
to their own funerals.
Dad wants them hit,
and he wants Rafael Vacarro found -- today.
Gentlemen.
You must be lost, friend.
Oh, my, certainly not, Dag.
May I call you Dag?
And Gregor.
Please accept my deepest condolences
for the tragedy that has befallen your beloved brother.
Who the hell are you?
A friend -- here to see your father.
Our father's not seeing anyone.
Oh, he'll see me.
This symbol -- I saw it once.
Said to be the mark of the man who can do the impossible.
I was so very sorry to hear about your son.
Perhaps I could be of some assistance.
What kind of assistance?
I fear this child may be lost.
I'm here to help you save the others.

Raymond, I know that you're always going to do
what you believe is the right thing to do.
But I don't ever want you to think
that you have to change your plans on my account.
Plans change.
Between Seoul, Moscow, then back to Beijing,
then Shanghai,
It would have been a month and a half.
I canceled it.
I wanted to bring you something.
Oh, Raymond.
What good is a collection if it doesn't grow?
It's beautiful.
It's German -- pre-war.
Survived the allied bombing in '45.
Miracle.
What is it?
I'm getting married.
Do you love him?
I love you.
You don't have to explain, Liz.
Whatever reason you have for giving your child up for adoption,
I'm sure it's a good one.
When Tom and I were looking to start a family,
you gave us all the information about the birth mother.
Would you be giving prospective parents information about me?
Couples looking to adopt know children
often come from difficult backgrounds.
And that's okay.
Even in an open adoption, I mean,
I would need to see the child.
That makes it more difficult but not impossible.
Whatever a mother's issues,
they're rarely held against the child.
You'll fill out a questionnaire,
which I'll make available to prospective parents.
At the same time,
you'll be able to look at their profiles online.
And if we both swipe right,
we're hooked up for life?
If you and Tom swipe right.
He does have a say in this.
Yeah, of course.
This is a decision that we have to make together,
and I mean, he would be here
if he didn't have to be away for work right now.
Excuse me, where's your restroom?
Gina.
Why are you doing this?
Hey, Jacob. How you doing?
It was nice to hear from you, too.
It wasn't nice hearing from you,
and I want to know why you're doing it -- the real reason.
I see your new home is a work in progress.
What colors are you considering?
You know, I usually like people
to enter my apartment after I'm in it.
Have you ever heard of the Promnestria?
No, is he here, too?
It's a term the Ancient Greeks used
to describe a matchmaker -- a negotiator.
In this case, a man who brings together warring crime families
through mutual self-interest, leverage,
or violence if necessary.
My mother -- was she still alive when I was placed with Sam?
Yes.
Why did she do it?
I let myself in because the situation is urgent.
On Wall Street, a well-planned merger
can return a windfall profit.
Criminal enterprises are no different.
The Promnestria convinces sworn enemies
that there is more profit in friendship.
In return, he gets a percentage of the new venture.
He only surfaces when he sees an opportunity
for enormous financial gain.
And I'm afraid he has resurfaced
to unite two very lethal enemies.
How did my mother die?
As I said, the matter is urgent.
Mads Eriksson runs a criminal conglomerate
with his three sons.
Or at least he did.
Hans Eriksson, A.K.A. Happy,
who later died,
was shot in a New York restaurant by Rafael Vacarro,
son of Daniel Vacarro.
Patriarch of the Vacarro Consortium.
They transported the heroin
processed by the Erikssons until 2003
when they had a falling out over a hijacked shipment.
Each family blamed the other.
And Gregor Eriksson was shot,
and Vacarro's nephew was killed.
If these organizations do merge,
they'd rival the Mexican cartels for the majority
of the drugs trafficking on the East Coast.
Start with the D.E.A.
Find out what they know about a merger.
Pull every tap, listen to every call.
If either side has said so much as a hello to this Promnestria,
I want to know about it.
I'm gonna throw you a baby shower.
Oh, Samar, no --
All I need is a guest list
and whether you want brunch or dinner,
co-ed or single sex,
and where you're registered.
I'm not registered.
Okay.
I'm gonna go talk to the D.E.A.,
and you are going to go to swag4mommy.com
and hunt for some cute onesies.
swag4mommy.com?
Who are you?
A jewish mother. Part of my Mossad training.
Darlings, wonderful news.
Mr. Eriksson and Mr. Vacarro
are open to hearing about our merger proposal.
I agree.
No, I've promised a solution, and we must deliver.
Yes, we'll need to be very creative.
What's that?
No, no, no, no. Say again.
Oh...My.
That is a brilliant idea.
Marilyn, you are a hopeless romantic.
Here, that's for you.
You, you've been of no help whatsoever.
That's why you want in on this? For her?
Your phony wife?
We're not married.
The mark you dumped me for?
She's pregnant.
We're having a kid, so, yeah, I'm doing this for Liz.
You expect me to hire you
so you and the woman who sent me to prison
can live happily ever after in the south of France?
You can think whatever you want, Gina,
and I don't blame you for thinking the worst,
but I need the job.
All right? I need the money.
The Major has been looking for you
ever since you left him for dead with those neo-nazis.
This is his op.
I work for him.
You honestly expect me to bring you on and not tell the Major?
You know what he'll do to me if he finds out?
I get it. I never should have called.
All right, I was desperate, and I thought --
"Gee, let me call the girl I dumped
to see if she can help with the girl I knocked up."
It was nice seeing you.
The take is $22 million.
Split six ways.
You'll have to split your share with the Missus.
Where are you getting your intel?
A confidential source.
I see.
So the D.E.A.'s supposed to hand over all our surveillance,
but you get to play it close to the vest?
Look, we could be allies or enemies.
We're asking for help, not demanding it.
And we're sharing what we know.
Our information is that a merger of the families was proposed.
Proposed by who?
Well, that's what we're trying to figure out.
I mean, you know these guys.
Who could make the peace?
Peace? With Happy getting popped?
If you weren't talking about peace,
I'd be prepping for an escalation,
which is what I should be doing.
Tucker.
You're kidding me, right?
When?
Mads and Danny rolled in an hour ago.
We also got a hit on Vacarro's wire.
We think they're gonna meet.
Guess that makes us allies.
There's a lot of people out here.
You, uh, sure about your intel?
You're questioning my intel
but didn't know your own partner was a Russian spy?
Yeah, 'cause I'm not.
You're not an agent either, comrade.
So I don't know what you're doing here.
Oh, come on. She's just a pregnant lady taking photos.
There's nothing wrong with that.
I've got a 20 on Danny Vacarro.
East side, walking to the corner.
Eriksson coming in from the south.
Yeah.
Say "Cheese."
I didn't think you'd come.
The Promnestria's reputation precedes him.
I've got men all around the park.
Yeah, me too.
Jesus, Navabi.
Seeing as how your boy made the first move,
like father, like son.
That's him. Are you guys seeing this?
Look, we need to hear what's going on in there.
Gentlemen, join us. Please.
I'm not drinking with him.
Please.
You say you can save my children?
You have five minutes to tell me how.
Navabi, get ears in there now.
Every successful merger is based on a recognition
of mutual interest, yes?
Merger?
That's it? That's your proposal?
That we merge our businesses?
If I can get closer to the windows,
I might be able to catch something.
If we don't actually hear them conspiring,
we've got nothing.
Your organizations both value family.
It's your greatest strength
and the source of your greatest friction.
So remove the friction.
Stop the bloodshed by joining the bloodlines.
Your youngest son,
your youngest daughter...
bound in marriage.
Yes, you can do the impossible --
find something we can agree on.
This marriage will never happen.
This marriage must happen.
Before your falling out,
you controlled 65% of the drug trade on the eastern seaboard.
Now you control 22%.
You may not want to merge,
but if you don't, you'll be out of business.
My daughter's not a commodity to use in a business negotiation.
Studies show that love, satisfaction, and commitment
are equally common in both arranged
and love-based marriages.
So I am confident that my proposal
can result in happiness and financial reward.
What you're proposing requires trust.
We have none.
None of my clients do,
which is why you, like all my clients,
must swear to uphold and enforce not only this merger,
but all mergers brokered with my assistance.
Here is my client list.
They are powerful and well-armed.
Should either of you betray the other,
they will destroy your families.
You'll want some time to think it over.
I do hope you see the merit in my proposal.
We do so love a wedding.
Yes, we do.
Yes, we do.
Yes, we do.
What you're talking about isn't a job.
It's a suicide mission.
Only two crews have targeted Reinder-de Groot.
Both were slaughtered.
By Geert Klerken, I know.
But that was 12 years ago.
Which is why nobody has been crazy enough to try it since.
Well, almost no one.
Over the past four months,
a crew of mine has been lifting a piece here,
a piece there from their showroom,
adding up to almost half a million dollars.
Why would you antagonize a psychopath for $500,000?
To get his attention.
Reinder-de Groot uses only the finest stones.
They're transferred to a secure vault
and basement work rooms,
where they're placed in settings
and shipped to stores all around the world.
And you want to hit those work rooms?
I'm getting in.
All I need is a pretty face to help me get there.
Know where I can find one of those?
Remember the jazz club you took me to
in that little cave in St. Germain?
We should go there right now.
No, it closed.
When did it close?
Six months ago.
Oh, my Gosh.
It's been that long.
I can protect you.
All you need to do is ask.
You know what I need?
I need you to take me to Amorino.
Buy me a Stracciatella.
And then maybe I'll give you a bite.
Raymond. We have arrived.
Hello, Lizzy. You have the photo?
Good luck getting an I.D. the D.E.A. had nothing.
Facial recognition was a bust.
C.S.U. swept for prints,
but it's an active business.
They pulled hundreds of latents.
Running those will take time we don't have.
Your law enforcement agencies
love their gadgets and their sweeps.
The FBI admitted to spending, what,
a billion dollars in facial-recognition software?
Which means they spent at least $3 billion.
Honestly, if I paid taxes, I'd be outraged.
Rogelio!
Como esta?
Bien. Raymond!
Hey, hola, Dembe.
What happened to your arm?
Snowboarding.
This man, I want him found.
For you, Raymond, claro que sí.
Right now hotel maids, cooks, waiters,
valets all over the city are receiving that photo
and will be searching for our target.
The people who do all the cooking, cleaning,
washing, carrying, and parking,
they have access to everything.
You may recall I once had the opportunity
to broker the sale of Rembrandt's
"Storm on the sea of Galilee."
You mean do I remember you being in possession
of a stolen masterpiece? Yeah, I recall that.
Well, the man who actually stole the painting --
Rogelio's cousin was his gardener.
How is Tony?
Deported. Last month.
Dembe will give you the number of our man in Calexico.
He just built a fabulous tunnel.
We'll have Tony back by this time next week.
Many thank yous, my friend.
Your fee and a bonus to the first person to spot our man.
How the hell did Reddington find this guy?
He's like a magician. I hate magicians.
That and lap dogs.
I mean, I really hate lap dogs.
Aram, what have you got?
All right, the money for the room was wired
from a phony overseas account,
but I do have a cell number used to book the reservation.
Mr. Cooper is expediting a warrant for a tap.
Also, according to the registry,
his name is Maximiliano Cartier,
马西米利亚诺·卡迪尔
which however awesome is obviously a fake.
Speaking of registries, Aram,
do you want to go in on a baby gift for Liz?
She register for common sense?
'Cause if she's down for having Tom's kid, she needs some.
I think it's romantic to forgive someone you love
even if they had an insane error in judgment,
which gives you night sweats
and causes you to lose nine pounds in a month.
I mean, it could anyway, in...
in theory.
He's got company.
Mr. Vacarro has agreed to move forward if you agree.
What about the stumbling block?
I have a solution.
But I should warn you it will require you to mislead your son.
Hey, guys. Bad news --
The cell number he used to book the room is a burner.
Who is this guy?
You're asking me to hurt my son.
But if I say no, this war will kill him.
You have my permission.
My people are standing by.
It will be done today.
All right, you stick with Eriksson.
I'll, uh, stay with Liberace and the pooches.
You want our daughter to marry an Eriksson?
No, it's not what I want, but after two decades --
This won't change that!
We agree that it will.
And this agreement is enforceable.
By whom? This man you just met?
He has the power to keep the peace?
The killing has to stop.
And whatever price we have to pay to make that happen --
I thought you were mad 'cause I scratched the car.
Alicia.
Baby, we're not doing this.
Mama, I'm not a child anymore.
I know who we are.
All the funerals, the sacrifices made for this family --
I've always wondered what I would have to do
to make a difference.
Maybe now I know.
Yeah, he's still outside at City Memorial.
He hasn't moved in about, uh, 20 minutes.
Why?
I don't know, but maybe you can tell me.
Why don't you search patient records,
staff, physicians, anyone with the last name Eriksson or Vacarro.
I'm looking, but...
Hold on.
No, nothing.
Oh, hang on, hang on. He's moving.
So, I think I have an hour for lunch.
You know you won't have to work once we're married.
Really?
What if I want to?
Hang on. Anna Gardner.
注册护士
She's Christopher Eriksson's fiancée
and a nurse at City Memorial.
Christopher -- which one is that?
He's the youngest son.
That must be why the Promnestria is there.
Get out of the way! Move!
Anna!
Baby.
No, no. No, no, no.
FBI, FBI!
Hey, come here! Come here!
You're gonna be okay.
This is Mr. Fox, our inside man.
Communications, security, our gemologist, the driver.
Very friendly.
Gentlemen. We hit Reinder-de Groot at 5:45.
15 minutes before the security swing shift arrives.
That's the window. We get caught, we're dead.
Not arrested, dead.
Okay, then.
Let's go to work.
I got you a little something.
Some might say it's a disguise,
but I guess it's who you really are.
Just my size.
Such a pretty face.
Christopher.
She's dead.
I know.
They came for me, and they got her.
We have to go after them -- hard.
What we have to do is make it stop.
What does that mean?
Who are you?
You were at the hospital.
My dear boy,
I simply cannot convey the depth
of my condolences for your senseless loss.
And killing a harmless girl, a true innocent --
it's proof that this conflict must end.
We have something to discuss.
They said they're interested?
Yes, they're dying to meet you.
They're checking their schedule,
but they said they want to meet as soon as possible.
Oh, that's perfect.
Well, uh, as soon as you have a time,
just give me a call back.
Okay, that's great, Levi. I'll see you tomorrow.
Levi?
How is your impossibly gorgeous ex?
He asked me to dinner, so I'm going. It's nothing.
Have you decided where to register?
The burp rags can wait.
What happened at the hospital?
Her name was Anna Gardner.
She was a nurse at City Memorial
and Christopher Eriksson's fiancée.
Why would the Promnestria have Christopher killed?
All it does is make his family hate the Vacarros even more,
if that's possible.
He wasn't after the son.
The fiancée was the target.
He's brokering a marriage.
Between these two families? That's absurd.
You really think it's possible
that he had Christopher's fiancée killed
so Christopher would be available to marry a Vacarro?
Arranged marriage has been a tool of peacekeeping
and empire-building for centuries.
It's still practiced in many parts
of Asia, Africa, the Middle East.
Thousands of children are forced
into arranged marriages every year,
often with judicial approval.
The Erikssons and Vacarros are not just families,
they're businesses.
This isn't about love and marriage.
This is about profit and loss.
The Promnestria will require a meeting
of all family members to formalize the arrangement.
Find that meeting, and you'll find him.
And how do you propose we do that?
Funny you should ask, Harold.
Hello, Mads.
Raymond Reddington.
Your contact at the port of New Orleans -- call him.
Confirm he received an anonymous tip about a D.E.A. raid.
Saved you about $10 million in lost inventory.
Do you have any cookies?
I-it's me. I'm told there was a raid.
And we're good?
These are yummy. It's the nutmeg, isn't it?
I'll call you soon.
You tipped my people? Why?
Wedding present.
You heard.
I respect the decision, Mads.
Difficult one, I'm sure, but good for business.
Mazel tov.
My kid is not happy about it.
What about you? Danny Vacarro for an in-law?
Talk about a labor of love.
Thank you for the tip, Raymond.
The families, theirs and ours,
we're getting together tomorrow.
It'd be nice to have a friendly face.
I'd rather die than have an Eriksson touch my little girl.
So would I.
But you're giving her away.
For what?
A business deal that will never hold?
A war that will never end?
Oh, it will.
The Erikssons are all coming to the celebration.
What are you saying?
We kill them tomorrow.
All of them.
We staged the D.E.A. raid
so Reddington could tip off the Erikssons.
In exchange, he was supposed to give us intel
on the families meeting.
So where the hell is he?
I can't get him to call me back.
Okay, so, I've been monitoring the Promnestria's burner,
and he just placed a call
to some kind of personal assistant, I think.
The call was made to a residence in London
owned by a Mr. Alistair Pitt.
So Scotland Yard pulled his taxes.
He's the right age for our suspect,
claims he's a corporate consultant.
Here. And listen.
There's a dinner tonight at the Greenwald to formalize.
I'll need a car to take us there at 7:00,
then directly to the airport.
Notify Ressler and Samar.
I want infiltration teams at the Greenwald Hotel
as soon as possible.
Keen, if Reddington reaches out,
don't take his call.
Mobile 1, we've accessed the hotel feeds.
All units report.
Eriksson is walking in now.
Gregor and Dag are behind him.
Davenport. Come back.
Security's tight.
No weapons, no phones.
On the Vacarro side, I'm seeing Danny, Mariana.
No sign of Rafael.
He knows there's an open warrant.
Warrant or not, everybody who shows up tonight
is getting brought in for questioning, no exceptions.
You got approval for that?
Pitt murdered an innocent woman.
When he shows, we take them all.
Whoa, look what the cat dragged in.
Your fugitive-in-arms, Comrade Rostova.
Don't call me that.
Davenport, we got a visual on Raymond Reddington.
Moving your way. We're gonna breach.
Negative, I repeat, negative.
Do not breach.
This is our op.
We breach now, we lose Pitt.
Look, we'll sweep him up when we grab the others,
but only once we see our target.
Oh, I really do fancy this necklace.
And that ring.
Can I see?
Of course.
Where is the mirror?
It's over there.
It is very nice, but it's about three zeros out of my budget.
Oh, my God.
I have to have it.
Oh, I left the keys in the car. Ugh.
Colin would kill me if I got another one nicked.
Be back.
All right.
Help! Somebody!
Sir! Release that woman!
She's a thief.
Agent Brian Kelly, FBI.
This woman is part of a gang that my team
has been investigating for six months.
I knew it! They owe me a half a million.
Her team is still somewhere in the area.
Do you have somewhere I can take her, somewhere private?
Let's go.
I need to call in the rest of my squad to secure the suspect.
Do you have a back entrance we could use?
Meet the police at the loading dock.
Let them in the back.
Suspect in custody. Come in through the back. Copy?
Copy that. On our way.
Champagne?
Thank you, my dear.
Mr. Reddington.
I'm so honored you were able to join us.
I'm a sucker for mob weddings.
What a night.
Raymond, right?
Mads tells me you two have business dealings?
I didn't know the two of you were on a first-name basis.
We're doing our best to forgive and forget.
There's some good in the worst of us
and some evil in the best of us.
And when we discover this,
we are less prone to hate our enemies.
To our enemies.
Excuse me.
I'm sorry, Raymond, if you'll excuse me.
All things considered, mom's a little cheery.
Keep an eye on her and Danny while I find the happy couple.
You loved her, didn't you?
Let me tell you a secret.
Love isn't a feeling.
It's a choice.
Ah! Darling, come in.
Come, come, come.
Come, come, come.
I understand you two have had an opportunity to talk.
That's good.
Then we're agreed.
I've got eyes on Reddington, Tucker.
Do I have the go or not?
Negative.
I was told to give you guys carte blanche
because you're bringing down guys
Justice hasn't even heard of.
When I asked how you did it, I never got a straight answer.
I think I know why.
You don't know anything.
I know we helped you when you were a fugitive.
Now, what aren't you telling me, Comrade Rostova?
I told you not to call me that.
It's all here.
Right after I finish the toast.
When I raise my glass, that's the signal.
Ladies and Gentlemen...
As the father of the bride, I'd like to say a few words.
So much of what has happened
between our families has been...wrong.
And it's enough.
And if it takes my baby girl to show me the path to peace,
so be it.
Mads, you have my guarantee
that no Vacarro will ever break the agreement
that we've made here today.
May they have the patience to endure one more toast.
I am but a humble guest,
but please permit me to raise a glass
to what I think we all can agree
is the most improbable yet consequential occasion.
What's he doing?
He's trying to draw the Promnestria out.
Love is a funny, fickle thing.
A slippery slope.
Most weddings are fraught with it.
This one, not so much. This is business.
The brainchild of a brilliant opportunist --
A broker of bonds, a procurer of peace.
You would think, being singularly responsible
for this evening's prenuptials, he might take a bow.
Where is he?
Come now, don't be modest.
You do such astonishing, despicable work.
Maybe I think it's enough.
I'm dying to hear how he did it.
How he brought you two jackals together.
How he got rid of Christopher's fiancée, Anna.
How he lied to the boy,
let him believe she was slaughtered by the Vacarros,
only to turn around and convince him
to marry into the very family he despises.
What a telenovela!
What the hell are you --
No, no, no, wait.
I want to hear what he's saying.
I once spent three weeks cooped up in motel on Zihuatanejo
just glued to the telenovela "Amorcito Corazon" --
"My darling sweetheart."
This unlucky-in-love architect who lost the love of her life
when she was 18 because of her controlling father.
But perhaps I cut too close to the bone.
It was you, Mads, who approved the hit.
Isn't that right?
Dad, what is he talking about?
He's wrong. Never would I have --
...Deceive your son, killing the love of his life.
They killed Anna -- you said so.
No, no, no, no. We never touched that girl.
You're the animals who operate like that, not us.
Oh, here we go. Better than TV.
You killed her, didn't you?
For this?
You knew I would never be able to let her go.
We did it to save you!
For the good of the family!
Gentlemen, everyone!
Please, please.
That's our target.
All teams on site, breach, breach now!
Do it now.
Grab the bride and groom. Meet us at the car.
D.E.A.! Freeze! Drop your weapon.
This was so you could get to him.
That's what this whole thing was about.
Might I suggest we have this conversation on the move?
She's not going anywhere.
Oh, for God's sake.
I knew it. He's your informant.
That's why you have so much juice,
why they let you off.
Isn't that right, Comrade Rostova?
I told you not to call me that.
Comrade --
Mr. Pitt and I have a plane to catch.
We most certainly do not.
I'd be happy to drop you somewhere safe along the way.
You want to tell me how many are on your team?
I've told you there's no team.
It was a mistake. I was in a hurry,
and I must have put the ring in my pocket --
Would you mind turning those off?
I'd be delighted.
Hey, we know your gang is hitting jewelry stores
all over the city.
All right, I want names, and I want them right now.
You want to have a go?
I thought you would never ask.
That's for hitting me harder than you were supposed to.
What was that for?
The hell of it.
Come on, family man. We have work to do.
Let's go.
Samar, I just spoke to the D.A.,
and he says he has enough evidence
to put both families out of business.
Hey, what's wrong?
Nothing.
Um, did you ever get registered? Because Aram is asking.
Samar, what's wrong?
I had dinner with Levi.
He's engaged.
To a woman he met a week after we broke up.
And it's fine. We were never gonna be...
It's just, um...
I don't know what I'm doing.
Forget it.
Let's just talk about the shower and how great it will be.
There's not going to be a shower.
Why not?
Well...
...I found this wonderful couple.
Josephine.
Josephine, open this door right now!
He knows. He knows about us.
Josephine!
Where are you?
Our apartment, place St. Pierre.
Hurry, please.
He's insane.
Josephine?
Josephine?
No. Josephine.
You! Get out!
What are you gonna do?
Josephine. Josephine.
Josephine, no.
I bought this flat four years ago.
So that some day I could bring you here
to the scene of your crime.
Josephine Molire.
Now, listen...
Josephine's father was the most prolific
criminal arms dealer in Eastern Europe.
But for all his success, he had a problem,
an enemy.
An aggressive and lethal competitor named Stockwell.
I had nothing to do with what happened to that poor girl --
Yes, you did.
Perhaps not directly, but very much by your hand.
You arranged a marriage.
The youngest Molire daughter to the only Stockwell son--
A burgeoning psychopath
with a long and troubling history of violence.
To guarantee peace and profit for all,
you arranged her marriage to this man.
Please. Don't.
Don't do this.
I held her in my arms
and watched the life disappear from her eyes.
You destroyed a creature
more beautiful than you could ever comprehend.
♬In these demon days♬
♬We're pulling our pay♬
They're not coming.
There's been a bump.
♬The lights on the hill♬
♬Are freezing us still♬
They're rejecting my baby?
No, not exactly. They still want the baby.
♬The fingers of fate♬
♬Stretch out and take♬
♬Us to a night♬
Oh, I see.
♬But something's not right♬
They're rejecting me.
♬Something's gone wrong♬
But I thought you said on the phone...
They hadn't put it together that you were that Elizabeth Keen.
I'm sorry, Liz.
But they'll only take the baby if it's a closed adoption.
Meaning I would never know my child?
My baby would never know who I am?
I can't do that.
I underestimated how difficult this was gonna be.
But if you are intent on giving up your child,
I think you have to accept
that you're not gonna be able to be in its life.

Josephine...
it's done.
