look at all these people
just sitting here and not tipping ,
working on their computers .
this guy has a brand @-@ new apple .
i &apos;ve been eating the same apple for a week .
i blame steve jobs .
these people are more like steve @-@ i @-@ have @-@ no @-@ jobs .
all right , that &apos;s it .
earl , i need to get the wireless router .
oh , is that what this is ?
i thought it was a cookie @-@ warmer .
attention deadbeat diners .
you can &apos;t just sit here all night and only order coffee .
this is not a starbucks .
and i know that because we don &apos;t sell
norah jones cds or bananas .
this is the router for the free wi @-@ fi .
and that is a waitress who needs to make some tips .
seriously , guys , i need actual cash .
this guy just offered to pay me in ideas .
if i pull this plug , the internet will go down .
and you--
that sad email you &apos;re in the middle of writing to your ex @-@ boyfriend ,
the one you shouldn &apos;t send anyway--gone .
and you--
that vaguely pornographic anime film
you &apos;ve been illegally downloading for the past three hours @-@ gone .
and you--that screenplay you &apos;ve been writing ,
you can keep working on it , but we all know how it ends :
with you moving back in with your mother .
now , who &apos;s gonna order ?
great , i &apos;ll go get some menus .
here , caroline , put this back .
ooh , my cookie @-@ warmer .
table ten just ordered cocktails .
yeah , &apos; cause we &apos;re that kind of a place .
does anyone know how to make sex on the beach ?
easy .
i put on my speedo and wait .
those girls have been drinking for hours .
just press every button on the gun and add rum .
look at them . not a care in the world .
having a great time .
i hate them .
i hate them , too .
i hate them more .
i hate that you hate them more .
so jealous .
okay , ready for party of four .
excuse me . pardon me .
excuse me . okay .
hey , baby !
looking good .
mm , always .
i &apos;ll be in my booth .
sophie , you cannot take up a whole booth alone .
there are people waiting . you must leave .
go stand in the corner now !
before i bend you across my knee and spank you
in front of the whole class .
well , i was going to stand in the corner anyway .
but tomorrow night , smaller table .
go stand in the corner now !
okay , i &apos;m over being jealous of them .
still ? what are they--
sitting on vibrators ?
let it go .
they &apos;re not having that good of a time .
no , max , we &apos;re not having that good of a time .
all we do is work .
when &apos;s the last time we took a day and just had fun ?
i mean , those two idiots remind me
how much fun it was when i &apos;d go out to lunch
and have cocktails with my girlfriends
and watch them pretend to eat .
i think you &apos;re talking about day @-@ drinking ,
and i think i like it .
all right , let &apos;s do something fun .
i &apos;ll put on my bolo tie and my best vest
and take my girl out to eat .
so , what is this lunch spot you &apos;re taking me to ?
is it french ?
do you think the chef will send an amuse @-@ bouche to the table ?
no , but this morning i shaved a smiley face into my bush ,
and it &apos;s very amusing .
you know what ?
it &apos;s just so fun to get dressed up
and have someone wait on us for a change .
i even bought new panty hose from dooahnay rayahdey .
you mean duane reade ?
oh , is that how you pronounce it ?
well , we &apos;re here . better get in line .
oh , there &apos;s a line . popular place .
what &apos;s the name ?
&quot; soup kitchen . &quot; that &apos;s a cute name .
very williamsburg .
like , &quot; let &apos;s take our upscale urban bistro
&quot; and make it seem like it &apos;s just a soup kitchen open to everyone ,
but it &apos;s not really a soup kitchen . &quot;
oh , that &apos;s nice . they let them use the bathroom .
and sit at a table .
oh , my god ! this is really a soup kitchen .
this is your idea of treating me to lunch ?
we &apos;re not homeless .
no , but we are soup @-@ less .
and it &apos;s not just homeless people who eat here .
okay , maybe they &apos;re the target audience .
look , there &apos;s a lot of other people
who can &apos;t afford to go out to eat .
you &apos;re right .
why are there so many hipsters here ?
because this place isn &apos;t just for people who don &apos;t have jobs ,
it &apos;s for people who don &apos;t want them .
well , it does smell good .
excuse me .
we &apos;d like to take a look at your lunch menu .
menu changes every day .
also , there is no menu .
there &apos;s , like , four things .
oh , okay . so what do you recommend ?
oh , what do i recommend ?
don &apos;t share needles , and and use condoms .
but you didn &apos;t hear that last one from me .
are nuns even allowed to be sarcastic ?
if they are , i have some serious thinking to do about my future .
this sloppy joe is the most amazing
terrible thing i &apos;ve ever eaten .
i love that it &apos;s basically pre @-@ chewed ,
so all you really have to do is swallow .
so good ,
i used to have these every day when i was a kid .
well , then i guess your childhood wasn &apos;t all that bad .
we couldn &apos;t afford the real manwich mix ,
so my mom &apos;s boyfriend , dirty carl ,
used to bring us leftover meat scraps
and then bash &apos; em together with old ketchup packets
he &apos;d found in cars at the junkyard .
now i understand why you think this is a nice restaurant .
have you noticed the more you drink ,
the better this place gets ?
i &apos;ve noticed the more i drink ,
the better everything gets .
why don &apos;t we drink every day ?
some of we do .
i &apos;m having a great time .
thank you , max .
well , yesterday , you were so bummed about your life ,
i thought i &apos;d take you somewhere
you could feel good about yourself .
okay , i &apos;ve been wanting to say this the whole time .
i feel like we &apos;re the hottest people in this room .
is that terrible ?
yes .
speaking of hot people ...
wait .
are we drunk or do we finally have one brain
and the same taste in guys ?
i don &apos;t know ,
but this is suddenly my new favorite restaurant .
let &apos;s go get ourselves some of that man @-@ wich .
i kind of like &quot; drunk caroline &quot;
way more than the other caroline .
i kind of like her better , too .
excuse me , sisters .
do you know the guy who just came in here ?
the cute one .
he &apos;s so cute , right ?
his name is andy ,
and he just opened a candy store across the way .
shut up ! candy ?
i love candy .
question :
what would make this day even better ?
candy ?
you should totally go for the hot guy .
or you can go for him .
let &apos;s think about this .
he &apos;s clean and not a drug addict ,
so he &apos;s more my type .
well , he &apos;s got a store full of candy and a penis ,
so he &apos;s more my type .
you know what ?
go for it . you &apos;ve got dibs .
aww , that &apos;s so nice of you , max .
yeah ,
and while you &apos;re doing him in the back room ,
i &apos;ll be pocketing some candy .
oh , no . it &apos;s closed .
hey , max , you know what &apos;d be fun ?
if we threw that trash can through the front window ?
i was gonna say we should leave him a note .
and what would be fun about throwing that can through a window ?
have you ever done it ? it &apos;s fun !
oh , the sign &apos;s turned around .
he can see us .
he &apos;s smiling at us .
should we go in ?
if i learned anything as a child ,
it &apos;s when a stranger offers you candy ,
you say yes .
hi .
we thought the sign said you were closed .
yeah , i turned it around . i wanted you guys to come in .
* come with me *
* and you &apos;ll be *
* in world of pure imagination *
if this isn &apos;t your thing ,
i also have some sabbath and some beastie boys .
so , if this is &quot; candy andy &apos;s sweets and treats , &quot;
are you candy andy ?
oh , please . we hardly know each other .
call me candrew andrew .
i &apos;m caroline , and this is max .
max , say something .
can &apos;t . it &apos;s all too wonderful .
look at all the candy crammed in this little space .
it &apos;s like we &apos;re inside willy wonka &apos;s colon .
thanks .
yeah , it &apos;s kind of the look i was going for too .
and i know it &apos;s accurate
because i had the oompa loompas help me .
常把doom @-@ pa @-@ dee @-@ doo挂嘴边 可代表任何词的无义词
they were expensive ,
but what are you gonna doom @-@ pa @-@ dee @-@ doo ?
normally i &apos;d ring the bell after something that golden ,
but i don &apos;t want to scare you .
well , now i have to hear the bell .
now that &apos;s all i want to hear .
do you do free samples ?
you do , by the way .
let me hook you guys up . on the house .
marry this guy right now .
it &apos;s a small store . i can hear you .
good . moves things along faster .
hey , come by the williamsburg diner sometime .
we work there .
we &apos;ll give you free samples of food
you shouldn &apos;t have to pay for anyway .
so , what brings you in to this neighborhood ?
oh , we were having lunch at the--
this ... is a really adorable space .
thank you .
you know , candy is my passion .
yeah , i said it . always has been .
even as a kid , i would have my g.i. joes
sell sweet tarts to my transformers .
gum drops , gummy bears , gummy worms ,
gummy hot dogs , gummy pizza .
ooh , i just had a gummy @-@ gasm .
so what was your favorite candy as a kid ?
actually , i didn &apos;t eat a lot of candy as a child .
okay , i &apos;m gonna overlook that because you &apos;re pretty ,
but maybe we could talk about
your terrible childhood over coffee sometime .
yeah ?
i &apos;d leave you two alone ,
if this place wasn &apos;t filled with candy .
okay , so what &apos;s your favorite flavor ?
coconut .
and i &apos;m walking to the &quot; c &quot; s.
the candy &apos;s alphabetical ?
now i &apos;m marrying you too .
okay .
let &apos;s see . seconut watermelon slice .
how &apos;s that sound ?
um , not so good .
actually , please don &apos;t say anything more about candy .
is it hot in here ?
no , it &apos;s awesome in here .
boston baked beans ?
didn &apos;t know they weren &apos;t real beans till i was 20 .
please stop .
is it cold in here ?
is it hot and cold in here ?
max , i feel weird .
relax , it &apos;s just your lady parts waking up from hibernation .
again , small store . can hear everything .
i am so sorry . pardon me .
oh , uh , are you okay ?
i &apos;m fine .
max , i am not fine .
i &apos;m gonna be sloppy joanne in about two seconds .
tiny , tiny store .
do you need to use the--
no . we &apos;re fine .
we &apos;ll just be going . nice to meet you .
nope , i &apos;m not gonna make it . where is the--
right--right there .
i &apos;m sure she &apos;ll be all right .
i &apos;m just gonna step outside .
the sound of someone throwing up makes me--
oh , dude , i &apos;ve been trying to not throw up this whole time .
whew , what happened there , right ?
feeling better ?
did she tell you she projectile @-@ puked soup and sloppy seconds
all over a really cute guy and his floor ?
let me put it this way , caroline .
in my heroin days , that would have been
a perfectly acceptable first date .
i don &apos;t understand it .
we ate the exact same thing .
how could you have not have gotten sick ?
you must still have &quot; rch girl &quot; stomach .
i &apos;m used to poor food .
what made you sick made my skin clear up .
hi , girls .
hey , sophie .
i &apos;ll be in my booth .
well , this is weird .
it &apos;s okay . you didn &apos;t know .
don &apos;t let it happen again .
okay , good @-@ bye now .
sophie , what do you think you &apos;re doing ?
what ? they were sitting in my booth .
it is not your booth , it &apos;s my booth .
if it was your booth , wouldn &apos;t it have a booster seat ?
oh , sophie wants to dance ? we gonna dance .
max . hi .
it &apos;s andy . from the store .
the guy who let you walk out
with a push pop in your pocket .
that wasn &apos;t a push pop , andy .
i was happy to see you .
well , you &apos;re gonna be even happier in a minute .
yay !
but these come with a catch .
invites for caroline and you
to a party at my candy store .
but maybe don &apos;t wear that uniform .
people are gonna think you &apos;re a giant sugar daddy .
so , she &apos;s still going at it , huh ?
such a skinny girl .
how much more can come out of her ?
nah , she &apos;s just a little embarrassed .
something about self @-@ esteem . i don &apos;t know .
she throws it around like it means something .
well , i &apos;d love her to come . no pressure .
but if you can talk her into it ,
there &apos;ll be unlimited candy for you
for the rest of your life .
look at him , stealing my bit .
the candy man came with invitations
to a party at his store .
what , you think i wasn &apos;t listening at the door ?
i heard everything .
all the vomit jokes . i heard them all .
jewelry , already ?
your new husband likes to throw the cash around .
he is not my new husband .
and now he never will be .
ooh , bubble tape .
i finally meet an adorable , sweet guy .
a guy so sweet , the word &quot; sweet &quot;
is next to his name on actual real estate .
and i completely destroy any chance i have with him .
you didn &apos;t destroy anything .
and it &apos;s good to let him know right off the bat
that you have a gag reflex .
oh ! oh , that &apos;s lovely .
happy valentines &apos; day .
i am not going to that party .
i can never see him again .
well , do you mind if i still go ?
being in a candy store after midnight
is on my bucket list .
funny , i thought that was the impossible one .
you should go . have fun .
i think you &apos;re missing out ,
because you two are perfect for each other .
you &apos;re like hansel and gretel .
they were brother and sister .
so ?
so , no caroline , huh ?
uh , no . she couldn &apos;t make it .
well , i &apos;m feeling very sad ,
but you &apos;ll never know it .
you &apos;re fine .
you don &apos;t seem to be short on other female party guests .
oh , come on . they &apos;re fiends .
some of them i know from the neighborhood .
some i worked with on wall street .
wall street ?
did you have a little candy tray
you walked around with ?
i wish .
that would have been awesome .
i was stuck in an office pushing stock
in pharmaceutical companies .
wait .
you know people who have access to pills ?
and just when i thought you couldn &apos;t get any better .
yeah , one day , i went into the firm ,
and there was no firm .
bankrupt . boom .
end of job , no money . nothing .
and after i drank nonstop for a week ,
i figured , hey , now i can do what i &apos;ve always dreamed of .
open a candy store , be my own boss .
so i used all my savings and opened up this place .
and pretty soon ,
candy andy will rule the world of sweets and treats .
that sound braggy ?
no .
all right , kick everybody out ,
and let &apos;s go back to my place .
ah ... max , no offense ,
but i &apos;m more into your friend .
um , andy , no offense ,
but i &apos;m more into the candy than the andy .
i want you to come to my apartment
and say hey to caroline .
i was right .
you two are perfect for each other .
yeah ?
i mean , it would be nice to hang with her
in pants i don &apos;t care about .
she &apos;s not here .
she must have taken the horse for a walk .
wait , you have a horse ,
and i &apos;m just hearing about this now ?
i have a candy store and it &apos;s out of my mouth ,
in the first 30 seconds .
be right back . i have to pee .
she &apos;ll be okay with me being here , right ?
yeah , she was just embarrassed . she &apos;ll get over it .
what are you doing ? knock first !
why are your legs up in the air like that ?
and why were you holding the shower head
down by your- oh !
i &apos;m sorry .
i thought you &apos;d be home feeling bad for yourself ,
not feeling your bad self .
what are you doing home already ?
why aren &apos;t you at the candy andy party ?
oh , don &apos;t look at me like that .
it &apos;s not like i &apos;m the only person
in the world who masturbates .
also , andy &apos;s here .
we wanted to surprise you .
but then you surprised us .
it &apos;s not a big deal .
that kind of situation happens to a lot of people .
who ? who has that ever happened to ?
i know this might be a delicate area right now ,
but i &apos;m thinking you should probably pay more
than half of our water bill .
hey , girls .
i need some hot tea to warm me up .
there &apos;s no hot water in our building
when i tried to take a shower .
that &apos;s because it &apos;s all in caroline .
max !
you are too tense .
here . take this and relax a little .
eh ?
this doing anything for you ?
well , i &apos;ll be in my booth .
hello , sophie .
what are you doing in my booth ?
it &apos;s not your booth , it &apos;s my booth . and look .
all the other booths are taken .
so you &apos;ll have to sit at small table ,
as is customary for lone diners .
this is my booth .
it &apos;s okay , you didn &apos;t know . okay , bye @-@ bye now .
hello , max . check out my new booth .
i think it &apos;s better .
oh , no . i don &apos;t want to see him again .
look , he &apos;s already seen you at your worst .
you vomited and masturbated . that &apos;s your full range .
hi .
look , i know you &apos;re really embarrassed about--
well , everything .
and there &apos;s really nothing i can say
to convince you not to be .
so ...
who &apos;s embarrassed now ?
and to further my embarrassment ,
i will now do gymnastics in public .
that is not embarrassing . it was amazing .
all right .
well , then come back to my house and watch me masturbate .
or we could just get coffee .
yay , i &apos;m so happy !
thanks , max .
no , not for you . for me .
i &apos;m getting unlimited candy and maybe some pills .
