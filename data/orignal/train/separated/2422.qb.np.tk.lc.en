i &apos;m elena .
i &apos;m stefan .
love brought me to mystic falls ,
love drove me away .
i am not sorry that i &apos;m in love with you , damon .
we &apos;ve all made sacrifices .
i did a spell that brought you back .
you can see ghosts . we can talk .
no ! you can &apos;t be dead !
have a nice human life , katherine .
but our greatest threat is still out there .
silas .
hello , my shadow self .
and he looks
just
like
me .
hey bonnie .
how is the summer almost over ,
and yet , i feel like i got nothing done ?
sound like you &apos;re having fun travelling with your mom .
i still don &apos;t know how i &apos;m suppose to do
this whole college thing without you .
and caroline agrees ,
she spent the whole summer
designing color palette for her dorm room .
while tyler &apos;s been away helping some wolf pack in tennessee .
don &apos;t worry , i already sent them your application , tyler .
all you have to do ,
is register for classes ,
and show up .
matt and rebekah have been sending post cards .
i think they &apos;re in amsterdam now ...
or was it prague ?
i can &apos;t keep track .
and honestly ,
i &apos;m not sure i really want to .
anyway ,
i can &apos;t wait to see you .
when do you get back ?
love , elena .
dear , elena .
wait ,
don &apos;t start with dear .
it &apos;s bad enought you &apos;re dead ,
now you &apos;re a control freak ?
i &apos;m just saying ,
people don &apos;t say dear anymore .
fine ,
how about ,
&quot; hey , elena , what &apos;s up ? &quot;
thank you .
hey , elena , what &apos;s up ?
you guys have no idea , how much i miss you .
i &apos;ve been emailing jeremy ,
who says it &apos;s been surreal to be alive . again .
hey , um , sor ... i thought you left .
i did ...
five hours ago .
all right , there &apos;s um ... there &apos;s pizza in the frig ...
if katherine ingesting the only cure on this earth
and having to live as a human isn &apos;t justice ...
i don &apos;t know what is .
i miss you guys . i &apos;m glad you &apos;re having a great summer .
p.s. have you heard from stefan ?
you ok ?
yeah . i &apos;ve just got this weird feeling ,
like something bad &apos;s about to happen .
well , it is . you &apos;re leaving tomorrow .
you &apos;re trading all this for communal showers
and a meal plan .
can &apos;t you just be a normal boyfriend
and support me as i attempt to have
a normal college experience ?
i &apos;d rather ply you with champagne
and spend the night convincing you to stay .
there were issues at home .
ever since i lost my parents and my aunt ,
i &apos;ve been acting out .
drugs , drinking . i was looking for attention ,
so , i lit my house on fire and faked my own death .
really stress the drug thing ,
and i &apos;d definitely say that the fire was an accident ,
because there &apos;s crazy and then there &apos;s ...
well ... me .
or i could just not go back ,
considering my school already had a memorial for me .
caroline just pulled up .
i--i can &apos;t leave . i should stay
and at least wait until jeremy settles into school .
you &apos;re leaving . you &apos;re going to college .
you &apos;re gonna drink cheap beer
and you &apos;re gonna protest things you don &apos;t care about .
and i am gonna take care of your little brother .
trust me . you have nothing to worry about .
ok , well , at least whitmore is only a few hours away ,
so , if there &apos;s anything you need , jer ,
just call me .
hey , see you on laundry day . ahh .
so , how do you think this whole long @-@ distance thing is gonna work ?
well , i personally plan on forgetting about you
the second you walk out the door .
i love you .
and i love you .
all right .
off you go .
yeah , no . we &apos;re not doing this .
go to school .
you &apos;re dreaming about stefan ?
they &apos;re not dreams . it &apos;s more of a feeling .
maybe i should call him .
so we can hear how happy you are with damon ?
absolutely not .
he &apos;ll call you when he &apos;s ready .
so , i should just live with this nagging pit in my stomach ?
ok , elena , that pit is called guilt .
you feel terrible because you broke stefan &apos;s heart ,
and that nagging feeling
is your brain waking up to tell you
that you &apos;ve made a horrible yet completely reversible mistake .
nice try .
besides , stefan and i left things in a good place .
it doesn &apos;t mean he hasn &apos;t been thinking about you
shacking up with his brother all summer long .
hello . mom ears . still here .
we &apos;re in college , caroline .
we actually made it . we &apos;re here .
we &apos;re all here together .
you brought a panini press ?
small appliances by the fridge .
ok . that &apos;s the last one .
all right . give me a good @-@ bye hug
before i change my mind and drag you home with me .
oh . you can call as much as you want , you know ?
mom , i &apos;ll be fine .
come here .
this is where your dad fell in love with medicine , you know ?
he would be really proud to see you here .
thank you .
ok , go ! before i change my mind and make you stay .
i &apos;m going . i &apos;m going . i love you .
bye , girls .
so , roomie , i think we should drink to something .
i couldn &apos;t agree more .
roomie . ha ha !
to us , and college , and being functional vampires .
to the next chapter of our life .
uh , who are you ?
i &apos;m megan . your roommate .
caroline says , &quot; get your ass to whitmore , bonnie .
we need you . &quot;
tell her i &apos;m at the grand canyon .
you realize you &apos;re just postponing the inevitable , right ?
what happens when your dad finds out you &apos;ve been dead all summsu ?
how many postcards have i sent him ?
how many times has he called ?
i &apos;ve done enough . he &apos;s clearly not missing me .
what about elena ?
i just saw her at college .
she seemed genuinely happy .
i am not taking that away from her .
we &apos;re lucky , jer .
how many people die and still get to talk to their best friends ?
how many best friends can &apos;t feel each other ?
i should get going .
the freak who faked his own death can &apos;t also be late for math .
what ? wait a minute . how did that happen ?
there must have been a mix @-@ up at the housing office .
compulsion . it &apos;s the ultimate unwanted roommate repellent .
that &apos;s exactly what caroline said .
right . so , then just compel her ass out the door .
damon , what &apos;s the point in going to college
if we &apos;re just gonna recreate what happened in mystic falls ?
look at you , giving it the old college try .
did jeremy get to school ok ?
yup . showered , groomed ,
even cut the crust off of his pb &amp; j myself .
so , what you &apos;re saying is that
me being here , you being there ,
this could actually work .
exactly . heh . listen , i gotta ...
go .
it &apos;s been a long summer , damon .
katherine .
5 @-@ star restaurants in paris to tapping kegs in a park .
tragic .
i thought we said no strings .
who said there were strings ?
weren &apos;t you leaving town ?
i thought i &apos;d give you one last chance to come with me .
i have to work . i &apos;m back in the real world now .
i need a paycheck .
great . maybe you could replace those earrings
that street rat nadia stole in prague .
those earrings don &apos;t bring you back to life .
how am i gonna explain to jeremy
that she stole his gilbert ring ?
tell him you had a threesome .
he &apos;ll understand .
don &apos;t call . don &apos;t write .
and whatever you do , don &apos;t you dare miss me .
hey . look who &apos;s back .
look who &apos;s , uh , eating her feelings .
yeah . i just dropped the girls off at whitmore .
ah . join me as i drown my sorrow in comfort food .
what are you doing ?
i &apos;m outing myself as not @-@ stefan .
obviously . don &apos;t be afraid .
don &apos;t move .
what &apos;s happening ?
we &apos;ve met before , actually ,
when i was appearing as your daughter ?
to bash your head in ?
does that ring any bells ?
silas .
indeed .
i am a 2,000- year @-@ old immortal
that caroline and her friends
thought they got rid of .
are you appearing to me as stefan ?
well , yes and no .
this is my true form .
stefan is my doppelganger .
you &apos;re confused .
i know that because i can read your thoughts .
it &apos;s understandable . i mean , i &apos;ve been a little cryptic lately .
what &apos;s with the knife ?
most vampires go straight for the neck .
oh , please , liz . i came first .
vampires are nothing more than a disgusting perversion of me .
i &apos;m unkillable , i &apos;m immortal ,
and i &apos;m psychic , and to function , i need human blood ,
but don &apos;t ever call me a vampire .
cheers .
unfortunately , i can see that you can &apos;t help me find
what i &apos;m looking for , so ,
all you need to remember , liz ...
is that stefan stopped by to say hello .
call your friends , stefan .
let them know you &apos;re ok .
will do , sheriff .
so , your current boyfriend damien--
damon .
is your ex &apos;s brother .
stefan .
and you and stefan are friends
but 3 months ago , he left without saying good @-@ bye ?
do you think i should call him ?
no way .
absolutely not .
do you have a boyfriend , caroline ?
i do . his name &apos;s tyler .
he had to miss move @-@ in day ,
but he &apos;ll be here for the first day of classes .
assuming he registers , and picks a dorm , and buys books .
speaking of minding one &apos;s own business ,
let &apos;s talk roommate ground rules .
privacy is very important to me .
same here .
i have low blood sugar .
my diet &apos;s finicky , so , keep your paws off my stuff .
we &apos;ll split up the shelves .
and if i suddenly get up to leave or disappear for a while ,
don &apos;t follow me or look for me .
ok . sounds good .
ha ! great . then we agree on everything .
excuse me , ladies .
party at whitmore house tonight .
we &apos;ll be there .
i hope so .
i love college .
look who rose from the dead .
nice phone . does it ever ring ?
you &apos;re gonna have to cut me off soon .
my tolerance is a joke now .
it &apos;s just so ... glorious .
you &apos;re miserable .
please . i &apos;m katherine pierce .
i &apos;m a survivor .
you &apos;re a liar .
your hair is messed up . your nails have chipped .
you &apos;re a sad , miserable human being ,
and you want me to turn you .
so , here . go ahead . drink up .
i &apos;ll kill you . you &apos;ll bite the mailman
and you &apos;ll be a vampire again .
go ahead . come on .
i can &apos;t , ok ?
no one &apos;s ever taken the cure before .
if i die , there &apos;s a good chance
i may never wake up .
and that would be tragic .
and deep down , in that mushy @-@ gushy elena @-@ loving heart ,
there &apos;s a part of you that doesn &apos;t want me to die .
what are you doing here , katherine ?
salvatore residence .
hello , principal weber .
this is elena .
oh , dear .
we &apos;ll find him .
so , jeremy &apos;s been expelled .
elena will be cool with that , right ?
when i get back here , you &apos;re going .
wait , damon . there &apos;s someone chasing me .
then run . run far away .
damon , you don &apos;t understand .
i have enemies everywhere .
what happens when word gets out that i am a human ?
i can &apos;t protect myself .
i &apos;m weak . and i &apos;m slow .
do you have any idea what it &apos;s like to run in heels ?
i have blisters , damon .
please , just ... help me .
wish i could say it gets better .
the answer &apos;s no , damon .
why ?
so you can keep dying and coming back to life ?
you felt nothing but sheer agony for 3 months .
you hallucinate conversations with me to have something to do .
just turn off that pesky humanity switch .
it won &apos;t take the pain away .
yeah , but it &apos;ll turn off your misery ,
your fear , your hopelessness .
and then what , huh ?
let &apos;s just say that you actually notice i &apos;m gone .
let &apos;s say i get out of this .
what good is it if i &apos;m a monster again ?
how is that better than any of this ?
did you notice how megan &apos;s juicer
takes up all the small appliance space ?
she has an entire drawer dedicated to organic linen .
what happened to privacy ?
maybe if she didn &apos;t take such long showers ,
i wouldn &apos;t have time to go through her stuff .
how are you ok with a third roommate ?
because we &apos;re trying to be functional .
and being functional means we need friends .
we also need personal space .
i mean , what if we suddenly get a craving
and i want to eat her ?
or our blood bags go bad
because we can &apos;t store them in the mini @-@ fridge ?
and what the hell is protein water ?
you know what ? maybe if i drink it all , she &apos;ll want to move out .
caroline , no--
vervain .
what &apos;s going on ?
are you ok ?
yeah , she &apos;s-- she &apos;s fine .
what happened ?
water just went down the wrong pipe .
i &apos;m ok , really .
i shouldn &apos;t have touched your stuff .
i &apos;m--i &apos;m really sorry .
it &apos;s fine . just sounded like someone was dying out here .
ah . well , i &apos;m glad you &apos;re ok .
she knows who we are .
she drinks vervain water .
that doesn &apos;t mean that she knows about us .
seriously ? we share a bathroom with this girl .
what if she &apos;s a hunter
and she stakes us when we &apos;re in the shower ?
or she steals our daylight rings while we &apos;re asleep
and then we burst into flames when the sun comes up ?
don &apos;t you think that if she was a hunter , we &apos;d be dead by now ?
i think we should lock her up .
you know , let the vervain get out of her system ,
and then we compel her to forget about us .
caroline , i &apos;m not kidnapping our roommate .
the best way to convince her that we &apos;re normal
is to act normal .
do normal , human , freshman @-@ y stuff .
such as ?
hey , i remember you .
hey . flyer guy .
jesse , technically , but
&quot; flyer guy &quot; works too .
i &apos;m elena . this is caroline .
nice to meet you .
sorry .
you can &apos;t be nice to the guy ?
i &apos;m with tyler .
are you ? because he hasn &apos;t called .
from the mountains of appalachia ?
i &apos;m just saying i don &apos;t want you to get your hopes up
thinking that he &apos;s coming
when he hasn &apos;t really shown much interest .
did you tell damon that you &apos;re having dreams about stefan ?
see ? no relationship is perfect .
what the hell ?
someone must own this place .
we have to be invited in .
hey . i was wondering if you guys were gonna make it .
you guys going in or ...
go ahead .
why are you guys just standing there ?
we were just ...
caroline ?
waiting for someone .
she &apos;s late .
so ...
right . well , i &apos;m gonna go hang .
like i said , she knows .
one day . one day where you don &apos;t screw it up .
leave me alone , damon .
you &apos;re lucky you didn &apos;t put one of those idiots in icu .
says the guy that once killed me .
yes . in the privacy of your own home ,
away from prying eyes ,
unlike you , who went all hunter in the middle of a hallway .
you got expelled , genius .
does that mean i don &apos;t have to go back to school ?
i compelled principal weber into a very generous 3 @-@ day suspension .
elena does not need to know about this .
finish eating . meet me outside .
hello , damon .
stefan . welcome home .
thanks .
hey . megan . it &apos;s elena .
just calling to let you know why we left .
so , call me when you get a chance . bye .
ok . it &apos;s settled . when she leaves , we grab her .
or we could just let her know that you weren &apos;t feeling well .
elena , she saw us stuck at the threshold .
we might as well have flashed her our fangs .
there &apos;s no way that out of the thousands of freshmen
we were randomly paired with someone who knows about vampires .
maybe it wasn &apos;t random .
megan &apos;s calling .
hey , megan .
elena , you have to help me .
he &apos;s chasing me !
megan , who &apos;s chasing you ?
help me ! oh , my god ...
we can &apos;t come inside . the line &apos;s too long .
if you come out-- where are you ?
elena , please help me !
megan , can you hear me ?
get outside and we can help you .
oh , my god .
who did this to her ?
this was a vampire .
look , i get why you haven &apos;t called me back all summer .
i wouldn &apos;t call me back , either .
you mean because you stole my girlfriend ?
i &apos;m over it .
cheers .
katherine &apos;s living at chateau salvatore .
how do you know that ?
because i can read your mind .
kidding buddy . katherine called me first .
remember ? it &apos;s always been me first .
right .
hey , jeremy , looking good , man .
hey , stefan . glad you &apos;re back .
yeah . yeah .
all right , i &apos;ll see you at home .
great .
something &apos;s wrong . when he touched me ,
i felt a chill where my tattoo was .
what are you talking about ?
right before i died , silas grabbed me
and i felt the same thing .
silas is gone .
bonnie turned him into a big piece of rock , remember ?
i died .
jeremy , i bound the magic that took down silas .
when i died , the spell must have broken .
he &apos;s free .
that was silas .
that &apos;s impossible .
i &apos;m a hunter .
our whole reason for existing is to kill him .
i know what i &apos;m feeling , damon .
that--that was silas .
i just watched him walk through a crowd of people that saw stefan .
there &apos;s no way he could fool that many people at once .
he &apos;s psychic but no one &apos;s that psychic .
what did he want ?
why are you in my brother &apos;s bathtub ?
why aren &apos;t you ?
i will say that &apos;s a tempting offer .
mm . he flirts .
i like elenaless stefan .
you know , human looks better on you
than i would &apos;ve guessed , katherine .
i think you just accidentally gave me a compliment .
no , i mean it .
you sitting here all weak and vulnerable .
it works .
time for a field trip .
get her out of here .
don &apos;t tell me where you &apos;re going .
god , you &apos;re slow .
guess vamp speed came with the upgrade .
get out of my way and give me katherine .
first drop the stefan look .
what ?
what is happening ? our roommate is dead ,
there &apos;s a vampire at the party .
we don &apos;t know what she knew or who she told .
we should get out of here .
caroline . i left that message in her voicemail .
don &apos;t worry . i took her phone .
you what ?
hey , girls ? i &apos;m diane freeman ,
head of campus security .
are you ok ?
i mean , i think so .
i understand megan was your roommate .
i &apos;m so sorry you had to find her like this .
do they know what happened ?
we found a note .
apparently , she was struggling with severe depression .
wait . what do you mean you found a note ?
your roommate took her own life .
you think this was a suicide ?
we &apos;re convinced it was a suicide ,
but we can &apos;t seem to find her cell phone .
have you seen it ?
no .
ok . if it turns up , let us know ?
what is going on ?
if i have to hear the word &quot; doppelganger &quot; one more time ,
i think i &apos;m gonna actually have to learn how to spell it .
you say you don &apos;t believe me
and yet your mind is spinning at the possibility .
&quot; a , &quot; get out of my head .
&quot; b , &quot; i think i &apos;d know if my little brother had an evil twin .
oh , we &apos;re not twins .
see , when i became truly immortal ,
nature retaliated by creating a version of me that was killable .
it &apos;s called a shadow self .
well , whatever you are , your plan didn &apos;t work .
cure &apos;s gone . now , what do you want with katherine ?
i could tell you , but
wouldn &apos;t it be so much more fun if it were a surprise ?
you &apos;re not getting her .
damon , how well do you know your brother ?
do you really think he would leave town for 3 months
without so much as a phone call
so you could live happily ever after with the love of his life ?
or did you just delude yourself into thinking it would be that easy ?
where &apos;s stefan ?
he &apos;s suffering .
like i suffered .
so , call the hunter . bring me katherine .
and then i will tell you where your little brother is .
where are we going ?
are you deaf ?
i said where are we going ?
how far did you get ?
you said not to tell you .
you picked now to listen to me ?
we just passed old miller road .
good . turn around . bring her back .
what ? no .
what are you doing ? jeremy , stop .
you can &apos;t take me back there , jeremy .
damon wouldn &apos;t just hand me over .
silas clearly got in his head .
shut up , katherine .
hey , what the hell ?
ooh . your thoughts are churning .
it &apos;s like a spool of pink taffy .
it &apos;s very messy but very fun to watch .
anyone ever tell you that &apos;s creepy ?
you &apos;re worried .
jeremy &apos;s not answering the phone .
they should be back by now .
you think something &apos;s very wrong .
there you go , mayor .
this one &apos;s on the house .
thank you , matt .
so , when &apos;s bonnie coming back ?
well , i &apos;m not sure ,
but if you talk to her ,
tell her i said hi , ok ?
thanks for the beer .
you &apos;re welcome .
no way .
nadia ?
you remember me .
yeah . i remember you .
you got rebekah and me drunk and robbed us .
but it was fun until then , no ?
how did you know how to find me ?
let &apos;s skip the how and get to the why .
this wasn &apos;t mine to take .
you traveled 4,000 miles to give me back a ring ?
hey , if you don &apos;t want it ..
no .
i want it .
looks better on you , anyway .
what do you want ?
jaryakat a zem .
daryeet acza .
hey , megan , it &apos;s elena .
just calling to let you know ...
delete .
someone &apos;s been in here .
megan &apos;s tablet &apos;s gone .
along with her so @-@ called suicide note ?
can i see the phone for a second ?
it just doesn &apos;t make any sense .
first the roommate we &apos;re not supposed to have
might know about vampires ,
and then happens to be killed by a vampire
and now the school &apos;s covering it up ?
seriously , who is this girl ?
whatever &apos;s going on , it &apos;s not just about our roommate .
it &apos;s about me .
that &apos;s megan .
with my dad .
jeremy , hold on .
hey , i know you can hear me .
jeremy .
jeremy . aah !
open your eyes , jer .
you do not get to die on me . you hear me ?
i &apos;m supposed to be taking care of you , you little punk .
wake up . i &apos;ll kill you myself . uhh .
katherine is gone .
i don &apos;t care .
hey , caroline , look .
i put a lot of thought into this
and decided to defer school for now .
this werewolf pack i &apos;m helping , they need me .
i know it &apos;s lame to do this over the phone ,
but i figure this way &apos;s harder for you to kill me .
i &apos;m really , really sorry , care ,
but this is important .
you ok ?
yeah , i &apos;m fine .
sorry , caroline .
i &apos;m really glad that you &apos;re here .
i &apos;m really glad you &apos;re here , too .
you &apos;re thinking about it .
flip the switch , brother .
put yourself out of this misery , please .
did you forget how long it took me to come back last time ?
everything i lost in the process ?
you don &apos;t deserve this , stefan .
you did the right thing--you walked away .
you let us be happy , and this is what you get in return ?
how is that fair ?
just turn it off .
turn it off .
wait . stay with me , stefan .
what are you doing here ?
i know this is torture ,
but stay with me .
your humanity is the one thing
that makes you who you are .
don &apos;t let go .
please , stefan .
for me .
hey , sorry it took so long to call you back .
car trouble .
what happened ?
well , some idiot broke the window .
based on your voicemail ,
it sounds like your day sucked worse than mine .
you all right ? do you want to come home ?
i can &apos;t .
especially if my dad &apos;s connected to this somehow .
i need to know why .
yeah , it &apos;s probably for the best .
that l give me more bonding time with your brother .
i love you , damon .
good night .
you didn &apos;t tell her silas was here .
nor did i tell her stefan &apos;s missing ,
katherine &apos;s in town , or you got expelled .
so , you lied .
no . i withheld a bit of the truth
so that elena wouldn &apos;t drop everything
and come running home to help .
i &apos;ll figure all this out .
i hope everyone enjoyed the party .
it is--it is truly great to have an end @-@ of @-@ summer tradition .
my daughter has her own end @-@ of @-@ summer tradition
of overindulging in the cotton candy .
and now she &apos;s off traveling the world
and sending her old man postcards
from all her great adventures .
family is one of our core values here in mystic falls .
it &apos;s what this block party celebrates .
family as community--stefan .
do you mind if i say a few words ?
maybe when we &apos;re done here , ok ?
i &apos;ll take it from here , mayor .
oh , my god .
you &apos;re probably wondering how i did that .
it &apos;s pretty basic mind control .
and until now , it &apos;s been fairly limited to one person at a time .
but this summer , i &apos;ve consumed
an immeasurable amount of blood .
and i felt myself getting stronger and stronger every day .
and i started to wonder ,
what are the limits to my powers ?
how many people can i influence ? two ? ten ?
an entire town square ?
everyone stop talking .
that worked .
now let &apos;s try this .
no one make a sound or move a muscle .
now that i have your attention ,
i need a favor .
i need you to find someone .
you all know elena gilbert .
