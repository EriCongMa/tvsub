maybe we should go back .
that spot i told you about is just a little further .
you said that an hour ago .
ok , so , here &apos;s where we are now .
i think we passed that .
well , this is where we stopped for sammy .
wait , where is sammy ?
sammy .
sammy , quit fooling around .
sammy , where are you ? !
that &apos;s not funny !
don &apos;t ever do that !
all right . sorry .
did you hear that ?
it &apos;s not me .
no , no , no .
stay here .
what is it , dad ?
10 @-@ year @-@ old daniel lanham
was reported missing while on a camping trip
with his father last november .
his remains were just discovered by hikers in pennsylvania .
that &apos;s really close to the appalachian trail .
the rangers are the ones calling us in .
the trail covers 14 states and is nearly 2,200 miles long .
it &apos;s a miracle he was ever found .
i don &apos;t think he was supposed to be .
the unsub could have left him for the elements ,
but he wrapped him in plastic .
remorse ?
think he bonded with the kid ?
if he &apos;s an opportunistic offender , probably not .
what are the chances that daniel was his only victim ?
not good .
garcia , will you let the rangers know
that we &apos;ll be there within the hour ?
yes , sir .
we &apos;re gonna need some more wood , the drier the better .
how much ?
whatever you can carry .
i can help .
great . you can get the twigs .
i can carry logs .
yeah ? you and what army ?
i don &apos;t need one .
keep an eye on her .
hey , wait up , ana .
i &apos;ve got that stick .
hey , come , come .
hey , hold on , wait for me .
here &apos;s one .
ana ! ana , let &apos;s go !
ok .
ralph ellison said , &quot; i am invisible ,
代表作 《 看不见的人 》
understand , simply because people refuse to see me . &quot;
guys , i started a geographic profile
on the assumption that the appalachian trail
is this unsub &apos;s hunting ground .
we got lucky with daniel .
i doubt we &apos;ll find any more bodies .
parents think their kids are lost ,
but what &apos;s worse , he has them .
hiding out in the middle of nowhere .
the pennsylvania police considered daniel &apos;s father a suspect .
they interviewed him several times .
without a body , they can &apos;t charge him .
well , he appeared to be obsessed with finding his son .
he even went back into the woods dozens of times
following daniel &apos;s disappearance .
he claimed he was searching for him .
all right , we &apos;ll start with daniel &apos;s life .
he &apos;s been exposed to a large suspect pool .
community , school , family friends--
we can &apos;t rule anybody out .
agent hotchner ?
ranger turner .
this is agent rossi , dr. reid .
um , got out some of the maps
that we use for search and rescue .
just let me know what else you might need .
do you have the m.e. report on daniel ?
yeah . it got here just before you did .
is mr. lanham here ?
he &apos;s in my office .
we &apos;ve had him in a half a dozen times .
look what happened in march .
mr. lanham , i &apos;m agent hotchner with the fbi .
hello .
i need to ask you some questions .
mr. lanham , you went back to the same spot
where daniel went missing
every weekend from november until mid @-@ march .
that &apos;s right .
and then you stopped going .
why ? what changed ?
mr. lanham , daniel died sometime in mid @-@ march .
you need to explain why you stopped looking for him
at the same time that he died .
i don &apos;t know . i just ...
i just had this feeling that he was gone .
you and daniel went camping regularly in the woods ?
yeah .
his mother had full custody
and we only had the weekends .
i wanted to make them special ,
something he &apos;d always remember .
daniel may have been his only human contact for months .
you think he &apos;s done this before ?
it &apos;s difficult to say .
most child offenders dispose of their victims immediately .
they become overwhelmed with reality
and sometimes shame , until the urge builds up again .
this guy &apos;s moved past that , though .
he feels no remorse about his compulsions .
he &apos;s most likely had other victims .
if he &apos;s a preferential offender , they &apos;d be about
the same age as daniel .
garcia , look for prepubescent boys
who went missing from the appalachian trail in the last year .
better make that 5 years .
this guy &apos;s had a lot of practice .
it wouldn &apos;t have taken long for the elements to destroy the body .
he wanted daniel preserved .
maybe it isn &apos;t a disposal site , maybe it &apos;s a grave .
then he &apos;d have to leave a marker .
and he wouldn &apos;t want other hikers to notice it .
well , he doesn &apos;t consider himself a visitor in the woods .
he feels at home here like he owns it .
and he &apos;d want to show his dominance .
you know , animals make their mark
as high up in a tree as they can possibly reach .
he probably used an ax .
prentiss .
he &apos;s got another body buried around here somewhere .
so the night he disappeared ...
you set up camp ,
then fell asleep ?
yeah .
and then a man came in your tent ?
no . no one came in the tent .
daniel , he--he got up and he went out .
you ok ?
yeah . just bathroom . be right back .
i should have followed him .
but i didn &apos;t .
i fell back asleep .
you and the cops and everybody ,
you think that i did it .
it doesn &apos;t matter .
not to me .
the only thing that i care about
is what my little boy was thinking ...
that i wasn &apos;t there to protect him .
i was his hero and i failed .
how do i live with that ?
you think he &apos;s telling the truth ?
yeah , i do .
we found another body
at the disposal site , wrapped in plastic ,
roughly daniel &apos;s age .
his clothing matches a missing persons report .
boy &apos;s name is tyler stolts ,
and he was abducted 23 months ago .
when did lanham move to the area ?
summer of &apos; 09 .
then we can clear him as a suspect .
tyler went missing in october of 2008,
daniel the following november .
so he takes a kid off the trail in the fall
and keeps him all winter .
it &apos;s like he &apos;s hibernating with him .
what ?
i need to go pee .
go get mom .
please , i really have to go .
fine . make it quick .
go behind there .
ok .
i can &apos;t do it here .
all right . come on .
i don &apos;t want you listening .
then go back there .
ok .
ana , hurry up , it &apos;s freezing .
ana .
he said he &apos;d kill mom and dad .
who ?
me .
what &apos;d you find , reid ?
i went back 10 years , matching reports of missing children
with daniel and tyler &apos;s victimology ,
and in my estimation , this unsub may have taken 12 victims .
how can you attribute all of those to the same offender ?
the dates and locations of the abductions
create an unmistakable pattern .
then if he &apos;s been abducting children for 10 years ,
why weren &apos;t we called in before now ?
the thing is , he walks the entire trail , end to end ,
and each way takes approximately 6 months .
his sixth victim was taken
from dawsonville , georgia , in 2006,
then he walked all the way to manchester , vermont ,
and he took a seventh victim in 2007 .
he wasn &apos;t down south again until 2009 .
when james clutter &apos;s parents
woke up from a night of camping , he was gone .
they just assumed he wandered off .
we didn &apos;t get called in
because nobody knew he existed .
the crimes are years apart and across state lines .
the interesting thing is ,
10 years ago he was a more aggressive hunter ,
likely on the move hunting and killing all 365 days a year ,
but 2 years ago he stopped traveling so far .
he &apos;s slowing down .
i think something &apos;s affected his mobility .
old age or an injury from years of living on the trail .
but the odd thing is , for the past 2 winters ,
he &apos;s returned to this 30 @-@ mile radius .
he takes a victim with him in the fall
to stay with him until spring somewhere within that area .
these are harsh winters .
he needs to find shelter .
and it would have to be heavy camouflaged .
even the most experienced hikers haven &apos;t seen it .
our parents will be looking for us .
they &apos;ll know we &apos;re gone .
we want our mom and dad !
if you let us go , we won &apos;t tell .
promise . we won &apos;t .
right , ana ?
yeah .
you can &apos;t just leave us here in the dark .
robert !
we &apos;ll be ok .
what do we have ?
unsub took two kids this time ,
10 @-@ year @-@ old robert brooks and his 8 @-@ year @-@ old sister ana .
girls aren &apos;t his preference .
not a lot of families camping out in november .
he took what he could get .
and robert wasn &apos;t alone .
he couldn &apos;t risk leaving a witness .
the question is , how long will he keep her alive ?
robert , i &apos;m scared .
what does he want ?
i don &apos;t know .
what is he gonna do to us ?
i don &apos;t know .
do you think he &apos;s gonna ...
stop , please .
mom and dad know we &apos;re gone by now .
so they &apos;re gonna send everybody to find us .
but what if no one ever finds us ?
don &apos;t say that .
we &apos;re gonna be ok .
come on .
it &apos;s gonna be fine .
here .
he kind of looks like mr. binky .
robert ...
whose toys are these ?
the kids wanted their own tent .
they &apos;re too big to fit with us .
we could hear them giggling .
i fell asleep to it .
would it be possible for us to get a piece of each of
the children &apos;s clothing to help in the search ?
sure .
thank you .
i want to go with them .
mr. brooks , i need you to stay in the camp
in case robert and ana come back .
excuse me .
thank you .
mr. lanham , can i help you ?
i heard the news . i know this area as well as anyone .
sir , i can &apos;t have you on the trail .
i &apos;m not out here for vengeance .
what those kids are going through ,
it &apos;s the same thing daniel went through .
i understand .
i need to be here .
maybe you can help out in some other way ,
but you can &apos;t be here .
sir , i &apos;m sorry .
hotch .
excuse me . go ahead , reid .
ok , worst @-@ case scenario-- the children were taken at 9 p.m.
that gives him roughly a 12 @-@ hour ahead start at 3 miles per hour .
he &apos;s got two children .
at 2 miles per hour , that &apos;s roughly a 24 @-@ mile radius ,
the same ground we profiled last night .
but , hotch , if he &apos;s an experienced tracker ,
he &apos;ll probably realize he &apos;s being hunted by now
and discard all nonessentials .
like ana .
she &apos;s not his type .
until we have reason to believe otherwise ,
we have to assume she &apos;s alive .
we &apos;ll deliver the profile and get search and rescue teams going .
no ! what are you doing ?
he could have poisoned that .
but i &apos;m thirsty .
come here . i want to show you something .
i don &apos;t want to leave my sister .
you want a flashlight ?
he &apos;ll bring you one .
robert , please don &apos;t leave me .
robert ...
robert !
this unsub hunts for , abducts ,
and keeps his victims in the woods .
we believe he left civilization
and forged a home for himself right here in the wilderness .
which means he &apos;s lost any societal or moral restraints .
he &apos;s devoted his life to taking children ,
and he &apos;s found the perfect place to hide them .
he &apos;s found or made a shelter which is difficult to find .
it allows him to withstand harsh weather
and is secure enough to keep his victims from escaping .
so it must be sizable , underground or on a mountainside .
sometimes the voices of trapped children gets drowned out
by search parties calling for them .
which is why we &apos;re asking you to call out robert and ana &apos;s names
but leave pauses in between to listen for their responses .
ok , let &apos;s go .
ana !
robert ?
let &apos;s see , iron deposits in mckee &apos;s pond ,
so the water &apos;s undrinkable .
so that would leave ...
i always thought i had searched every inch of those woods .
do you ever think he ever heard me calling his name ?
even if he didn &apos;t , i &apos;m sure he knew you were looking for him .
i was .
i knew he was out there somewhere .
mr. lanham , do you mind if i ask you a few questions ?
you know this area better than anyone ,
and i think that you can help us find these children .
robert , what happened ?
what happened ? tell me .
next time he comes to get me ...
run .
and don &apos;t stop .
no , i don &apos;t want to go by myself .
promise .
ok , promise .
ana !
robert !
ana ? !
ana !
robert !
hey , when do the temperatures drop below freezing ?
by thanksgiving at the latest .
they &apos;d have to go where the food supply is .
and that saves us another 5 miles .
what about shelter ? where did you stay when you were out there ?
i was holed up in a cave mostly .
caves have a natural temperature .
they provide their own heating source .
i need to go to the bathroom .
me , too .
you wait .
i want to go to the bathroom .
get back .
down there .
stay ! get back !
i said go ! down there .
get back !
get up !
get up !
get back ! i said stay there !
run , ana , run !
run ! run !
get away from her !
stay away from her !
get off her ! aah !
get up !
get up !
ana ?
it &apos;s ok . it &apos;s ok . come here .
my name &apos;s emily .
you &apos;re safe now .
we &apos;ve been looking for you for a long time .
hey , ana . where &apos;s your brother ?
i thought he &apos;d run after me ,
but i looked back and he wasn &apos;t there .
ana , do you know which direction you came from ?
i don &apos;t know . i just started running .
robert told me to run and not stop running no matter what .
it &apos;s ok . you did the right thing .
listen , this nice ranger ,
she &apos;s going to take you home to your mom and dad now , ok ?
get up . get up .
get up !
i can &apos;t . i can &apos;t go any further .
this is all your fault .
i told you i wouldn &apos;t hurt you .
robert !
robert !
robert !
no matter how bad things get ,
they can get worse .
i shouldn &apos;t have left robert ,
but he told me to run .
he made me promise .
it &apos;s ok , baby .
but he still has him .
sweetie , you did the right thing .
ana , the man who took you and robert ,
what do you remember about him ?
he smelled .
he was dirty .
anything else ?
he was scary .
and he walked funny .
like with a limp ?
yeah .
good .
that helps us .
she must have come through here .
he &apos;s gotta have a shelter nearby .
all right , back the dogs up .
i &apos;ve never seen this cave before .
it could be a den , or it could go deep .
this has gotta be it .
all right , let &apos;s go .
it looks like he was in a hurry .
he left some cash , a week &apos;s worth of rations ,
and some clothes back there .
look at this .
pills and flowers .
i don &apos;t see this guy as a botanist .
do you think he smokes those ?
this mine &apos;s been sealed for years .
the shaft goes about another 100 feet and collapses in .
i also found a box of ammo
but no gun .
reid , i &apos;m sending you a picture of a flower this guy collects .
it &apos;s loading right now .
this guy &apos;s in survival mode .
if he &apos;s on the run , what does that mean for robert ?
it &apos;s devil &apos;s claw . it &apos;s a homeopathic pain treatment
most commonly used for swollen joints .
the little girl told hotch that the unsub walked with a limp .
he could be using devil &apos;s claw as a pain treatment .
the unsub needs drugs ?
it would explain why he &apos;s covering less and less ground each year .
you know , the thing is , though ,
that flower wouldn &apos;t keep him mobile for 8 months .
if he &apos;s suffering from a degenerative disease ,
he &apos;d have a hard time getting around without painkillers .
all right , come on , let &apos;s get out of here .
i &apos;m gonna tie you .
you make a sound ,
you run for it , you die .
got it ?
let &apos;s go .
come on .
all the trailheads in the area have been closed .
rangers are processing everyone coming off .
he knows every inch of this place .
he &apos;ll get out on a route we didn &apos;t even know existed .
guys , his first abduction off the trail was jonestown , pennsylvania .
what if he grew up around here ?
he could have a friend or relative in the area .
the closest city is harrisburg .
he needs supplies , medication , and a place to hide .
yeah , i don &apos;t want to hear your sob story . just pay me by monday .
what--who is it ?
let me in .
shane , i told you if i ever saw you again--
brandon , open this damn door before somebody sees me .
you stole my whole supply , you son of a bitch .
you know how long it took to buy back the number of pills you ripped off ?
what i got &apos;s so good , we can talk another deal .
ain &apos;t nothin &apos; that good .
what &apos;s your name ?
garcia , cross @-@ reference your list with men convicted
of sex crimes against boys age 8 to 12
in the early 1990s . start with pennsylvania .
he &apos;d have stopped showing up to parole meetings in 2001
and he &apos;s been off the grid ever since .
well , i &apos;ve got about 2 dozen of those , so--
wait .
oh , this is super weird .
11 of these men paroled in the early nineties
have the exact same last known address .
a cluster of pervs ?
that rules out areas that are near schools and parks .
housing options are limited , to say the least .
guess that makes sense .
the cluster would be the one place they feel safe .
garcia , what &apos;s the address ?
sending it right now .
i need at least 3 months &apos; worth .
that &apos;s it , shane . if that ain &apos;t good enough ,
find somewhere else to stay .
i know you got more .
i told you , that &apos;s all i got .
where are you hidin &apos; &apos; em ?
ah , come on .
ah , please ...
thought you said you didn &apos;t have any more .
what the hell is this ?
please , that &apos;s all i got left .
since you &apos;ve been so generous ,
i &apos;m gonna give you an hour .
play nice with him .
i don &apos;t want any bruising .
garcia , we think the unsub
might have suffered from a degenerative disease .
can you check prison medical records ?
ok , i got him .
shane wyland .
he was incarcerated in 1994 for ...
jeez , raping a 10 @-@ year @-@ old .
i have no idea why he &apos;s out now .
i &apos;m sending you his mug shot .
garcia , did any of the current residents of the cluster
serve prison time with him , or did they share a parole officer ?
i &apos;m looking , but i &apos;m currently dice @-@ less .
he &apos;s got a kid with him ,
so he &apos;s gotta be going to someone he knows wouldn &apos;t turn him in .
reid said he &apos;d need painkillers right away .
he left his supply in the mine .
well , there was a lot of money left in that backpack .
i don &apos;t know how much he &apos;s got on him ,
but those drugs aren &apos;t cheap .
but he &apos;s got robert .
to some people , that &apos;s as good as cash .
you ok , buddy ?
oh , i know something that always cheers me up .
want to watch a video ?
stay away from me .
oh , don &apos;t play games now . hmm ?
stay away from me !
come on .
come on .
come on .
you two take the front , rossi and i will take the back .
local pd &apos;s standing by to go in on our say @-@ so .
i &apos;m sorry .
get up .
wake up , kid .
look , i &apos;m sorry .
come on .
he &apos;s gonna kill me .
he &apos;s gonna kill me .
yeah , yeah , that &apos;s fine , well , i &apos;m not calling the exterminator .
you can go buy yourself some damn traps .
whoever did it , just get them out of here .
sir , do you know shane wyland ?
no .
have you ever seen this kid ?
definitely not . anybody under 18 walks in here ,
i got the cops on speed dial .
ok , so you want to score , who do you go to in the building ?
i got nothing to do with that .
come on , man ,
somebody in this building has the hookup .
look , this place is full of lowlifes .
a lot of them sell on the side .
we &apos;re looking for someone who would have moved in here
back in the nineties .
the only cat lived here that long
is brandon stiles .
room 408 .
thank you .
you tip him off , you &apos;re an accessory .
don &apos;t make a mess .
brandon stiles !
fbi !
it &apos;s clear here .
prentiss .
robert was here .
hotch , it looks like robert was in the room .
it looks like there was some kind of a struggle .
if he managed to escape , they could be chasing him down now .
all right , you continue to search the building .
we &apos;ll cover the surrounding area .
got it .
officers cleared the surrounding blocks ,
showed robert &apos;s picture . no one saw anything .
we need to clear every dumpster in a 4 @-@ block radius .
if things went wrong and he killed the boy ,
would he take the body out in daylight ?
he could get him out in a duffel bag .
east stairwell is clear .
copy that . i &apos;m on my way .
i &apos;m not going back to prison .
kid !
come back here !
uhh ! come here !
don &apos;t move !
i didn &apos;t take him . shane brought him to me .
i--i didn &apos;t do anything .
it &apos;s ok , robert . you &apos;re safe now .
get on your knees . get down !
where &apos;s shane wyland ? where &apos;d he go ?
i--i don &apos;t know .
he--he just dropped the kid off .
he said he &apos;d be back in an hour .
hotch , we &apos;ve got robert . shane wyland is not in the building ,
but he may be in the immediate vicinity .
let &apos;s go .
get up . get up !
he got away .
what about the kid ?
he &apos;s headed to the hospital .
uh ... we , uh ...
we found this in the mine shaft .
it &apos;s daniel &apos;s .
i &apos;m sorry , mr. lanham .
how often does that happen ?
not often enough .
shane must have seen the police presence and just taken off .
it was easy for him .
robert &apos;s a tough kid .
knowing he fought back will help him get through this .
in my entire career , i &apos;ve only brought back
a handful of kids to their parents after the 24 @-@ hour mark .
this is not a loss in my book .
before now , nobody knew that
there was a pedophile hunting on the trail .
now we know who he is and what he looks like .
his photo &apos;s been sent to all the ranger stations .
do you think he &apos;ll go back there ?
well , he can &apos;t function anywhere else .
he &apos;s got no place to hide . we &apos;ve taken that away from him .
it &apos;s just hard to accept there &apos;s no justice
for the families he destroyed .
we &apos;ll get him .
