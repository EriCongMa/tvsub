oh , my god .
ryan , what are you doing here ?
it @-@ it &apos;s not what it looks like .
really ?
how am i misinterpreting this ?
my best friend isn &apos;t screwing
my wife on the boat that i paid for
and named after her ?
that &apos;s a relief .
ryan , let &apos;s be reasonable .
reasonable ?
you came to me broke .
i gave you a job .
i put a roof over your head .
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m so sorry .
things just got out of control .
we &apos;re adults .
let &apos;s try and make this work .
i really didn &apos;t mean for this to happen .
so , it was an accident ?
you just took a wrong turn one day
and landed in bed with my wife ?
well , now she &apos;s gonna watch you die .
pull up .
pull up , pull up .
we &apos;re losing altitude .
relax , brah . i got this .
you don &apos;t got this .
you &apos;re a backseat aviator .
you know that ? you tell your partner
how to drive ?
he doesn &apos;t drive .
now , pull up or we &apos;re gonna crash .
pull up .
i can &apos;t .
pull up , pull up !
pull up . up , up , up , up , up , up .
sweet .
passed my written tests with flying colors .
with your help , i &apos;ll be licensed in no time .
yeah , that &apos;s provided you don &apos;t crash the helicopter
during the flight exam tomorrow . okay ?
crash ?
look at me . i &apos;m top gun , baby .
don &apos;t look at me .
the ten @-@ year post @-@ parole plan is working out .
i got my shave ice ,
i got my shrimp ,
and when i officially open kamekona &apos;s island tours ,
that &apos;ll be my entrepreneurial peak .
like king kamehameha landing on waikiki ,
i &apos;ll rule o &apos;ahu .
boys and their toys .
how cute .
this ain &apos;t no toy , sistah .
that &apos;s right .
this is the most technologically advanced
flight simulator on the market .
well , it looks a whole lot like a video game to me .
oh ... up , up , up , up , up , up , up , up , up , up , up !
what are you doing ? pull up ! pull up ! up ! up !
got two words for you : game over .
if you crash a helicopter full of paying customers ,
it &apos;s not gonna be good for your tour business .
you understand ?
i was distracted , brah .
sistah came in dressed like that .
how am i supposed to not look ?
aw . kammy , if you hadn &apos;t crashed in the middle of the ocean ,
i might have taken you out for a drink .
that &apos;s the beauty of a flight simulator .
when you flame out , just hit restart .
take a seat . we &apos;re going to the big island
for some mai tais .
ooh , sweet .
yeah . mcgarrett .
okay , i &apos;m on my way .
i got to go . see you later ?
hope so .
don &apos;t worry . i &apos;ll bring her back in one piece .
repeat after me : altitude is my friend .
altitude is my friend . roger that .
all right .
all right , let &apos;s do this .
ready ?
yeah .
report said arson ?
yep . third boat burned this month .
all the same company .
oahu shark tours .
they take tourists out to dive
with the meat eaters .
there &apos;s been a lot of opposition
about the shark tours lately , right ?
i mean , locals have been protesting ,
saying they create all kinds of
environmental and safety issues .
well , i &apos;m opposed to anything that has to do with sharks ,
uh , due to self @-@ preservation , you see .
i remember your fear of becoming &quot; man sushi . &quot;
uh , hpd got any leads on the first two arsons ?
nothing solid .
the first two arsons happened while the boats were docked .
this time , it was torched at sea .
the fire hit the gas tank , and then ... boom .
how many victims ?
none .
none ?
well , that boat didn &apos;t take itself off @-@ shore .
it was found abandoned .
hpd suspects that whoever was
piloting it must have jumped overboard
before the explosion .
coast guard &apos;s out searching now .
not again . you got to be kidding me .
look , who &apos;s in charge here ?
i got to talk to someone .
here , send him over .
sir , i &apos;m steve mcgarrett .
this is officer kono kalakaua .
detective danny williams .
we &apos;re five @-@ o.
what can i do for you ?
you &apos;re craig brant ,
one of the owners , right ?
yeah . this is my boat .
this is the third one torched .
do you have any idea who did this ?
as a matter of fact , sir ,
we &apos;re focused on trying to locate
anybody who might have been onboard .
do you know who took your boat out last night ?
no one took my boat out last night .
it was docked here all night .
you guys are just as clueless as hpd .
well , if it was docked , then how come
we found it floating three miles offshore
with no one aboard ?
jason .
who &apos;s jason ?
my brother . he goes out
at the end of the day to get the cage we use for the dive .
well , there &apos;s no cage aboard ,
so that means jason must not have picked it up .
he could still be out ?
look , you got to go find him .
know what i don &apos;t understand ?
what ?
why would a tourist want to be put into a cage
and then dunked into shark @-@ infested waters ?
it makes no sense .
&apos;cause they &apos;re on vacation .
you know , they want some ...
some excitement , some adventure .
they need to do therapy .
hold on .
this is where craig said the cage was anchored .
i don &apos;t see a body .
i don &apos;t see a shark cage floating around here .
unless someone sank it .
take a look .
three o &apos;clock .
would they be circling around like that if that thing was empty ?
no .
hate it when i &apos;m right .
well , no signs of petechial hemorrhaging ,
which leads me to believe your victim
was thrown into the cage after being murdered .
what do you got for c.o.d. ?
well , based on these lacerations ,
i &apos;m thinking blunt force trauma .
however , i &apos;m not gonna be able to make a confirmed determination
on either of these theories until my post is complete .
so , someone gives this guy a beating ,
throws him into this cage ,
then torches his boat .
you still think it was the protestors ?
if it was , they made their point , right ?
you know you &apos;re an enabler , right ?
oh , this ought to be good .
go on .
okay .
well , kamekona told me about your little flight school .
okay , i &apos;m helping a friend pursue a dream .
more like delusion .
and if you &apos;re really his friend ,
you should help him open up a bowling alley or something safe .
not , uh , something that defies the law of gravity .
correct me if i &apos;m wrong ,
but weren &apos;t you the guy who helped him
buy the helicopter in the first place ?
yes . under duress , one ;
and two , i never thought that any state or any federal agency
would @-@ would license that man to fly it .
what did you think he was gonna do with a helicopter , danny ?
i don &apos;t know . park it next to his shrimp truck .
turn it into a barbecue .
what do i know ?
what i do know is that i do not ...
do not feel comfortable
with that man piloting three tons of steel
over the town where my daughter lives . okay ?
fine , okay . so you &apos;re not gonna
participate in the inaugural flight ?
no , i am not going to participate in the inaugural flight ,
because there will not be one .
okay , there is no way that that shrimp copter
is ever getting off the ground .
why do you have to always , always be so negative ?
i &apos;ll make a deal with you . how about that ?
okay , he gets his wings ,
and i will fly with him , okay ?
but you and i both know that is never going to happen .
oh , i see . &apos; cause you know what &apos;s gonna happen .
that &apos;s the i @-@ know @-@ everything face .
it &apos;s good .
hey , guys . so , csu finished processing the victim &apos;s boat ,
and they found high @-@ velocity blood spatter on the railing .
well , it can &apos;t have been our vic . he didn &apos;t have a gunshot wound .
yeah , but check this out .
csu also found a partially burned bang stick in the rubble .
ah , that &apos;s good news .
what is a bang stick ?
oh , it &apos;s a specialized firearm that can be used underwater .
fires buckshot on contact .
yeah , skin divers use them
to scare away or kill aggressive sharks .
divers packing heat .
that &apos;s nice .
what , they just go up to the shark and shoot &apos; em between the eyes ?
doesn &apos;t seem very fair .
wait a minute . now you &apos;re on the sharks &apos; side ?
well , i &apos;m not on anybody &apos;s side .
i &apos;m just saying , i could see how they &apos;d get pissed off .
well , i know a really great environmental group
that protects sharks if you &apos;re interested .
no , no . but thank you , kono .
did csu find any gsr on site ?
no , but they did find a discharged shell in the bang stick .
the fire had melted it to the inside .
and since csu didn &apos;t find any buckshot on the boat ,
i &apos;m thinking our victim jason brant used the bang stick
to defend himself against his attacker .
and the perp took the full load .
the only problem is , csu ran the blood ,
and there are no matches in the system .
and there were no gunshot victims admitted to any area hospitals .
okay , if we &apos;ve got a wounded perp ,
he &apos;s gonna have to surface sooner than later .
our techs found fresh paint transfer
on the starboard hull of your victim &apos;s boat .
could belong to our perp &apos;s boat .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m thinking , so i analyzed a sample of the paint
and matched it to altor nautical .
it &apos;s used exclusively on their oceanus line of fishing vessels .
arctic white . please tell me that &apos;s not a common color .
only three registered in this color on the island .
but one &apos;s been in california for the last month ,
and the other &apos;s in dry dock .
that leaves the carlyle , which is docked in haleiwa harbor .
that the same harbor where our victim docked his boat .
hold on a second . you think
we had something to do with jason brant &apos;s murder ?
come on , man . no way .
no way ?
all right , well , shark @-@ infested waters--
that &apos;s not necessarily good for fishing , right ?
basically , your competition .
i &apos;ll admit , i wasn &apos;t sorry about
what was happening to their boats .
nobody likes the shark tours here ,
but we didn &apos;t kill anybody .
all right , well , do me a favor and explain
what happened to your boat there , okay ?
&apos;cause the same damage and paint transfer was on jason &apos;s boat ,
and it matched the paint on your boat .
look , we were trying to be good samaritans .
good samaritans ? what do you mean ?
about a week ago , we pulled in a haul of mahi @-@ mahi a few miles out .
saw an aluminum skiff tied off to the shark tour boat .
some guy was beating on jason pretty good .
we went over to help ,
and the dude bolted in the skiff .
what happened after that ?
we climbed on board to see if jason was okay .
water was pretty choppy that day .
our boats knocked a couple of times .
that &apos;s when the damage happened .
you can ask around .
everyone at the docks heard about
the beat @-@ down the kapu put on him .
kapu ?
wait a minute . you sure about that ?
yeah .
word is they didn &apos;t like the shark tours
so close to their shores .
all right , there &apos;s a lot of kapu members on the north shore .
jason give you a name ?
no .
but everyone knows those guys don &apos;t like
anyone messing with their break .
and if you do ,
they can get pretty nasty .
we need to talk to kawika .
all i am saying is that
it is not beyond the realm of possib ...
in fact , forget that .
it is a very bit possibility that kawika &apos;s surf gang ...
surf club .
oh , excuse me , the surf club .
you &apos;re in a mood today , aren you ?
no , i &apos;m not in a mood .
my mood is fine .
all right , the point is , it is very possible
that the kapu is responsible for jason brant &apos;s murder .
i don &apos;t buy it , okay ?
i don &apos;t buy it .
okay .
at one time , yes , the club was territorial .
there was a lot of outsiders moving into the north shore ,
and-- right or wrong--
they used violence to protect what was theirs .
okay ? but @-@ but now ...
now , they are bastions of philanthropy , right ?
giving of themselves to worthy causes .
huh ? live and let live ? is that it ?
i know these guys , danny , is what i &apos;m saying .
i know these guys , and they &apos;re not killers .
okay , they &apos;re not killers .
well , let @-@ let &apos;s just take a second and look at the facts .
okay ? two witnesses say that they saw
a member of the kapu give jason brant a beating .
okay , and lo and behold , max said the cause of death
was blunt force trauma .
what does that mean ?
it means he was beaten , most likely repeatedly .
so , can we just say that maybe it &apos;s a possibility
the kapu has fell back into their old ways ?
is that possible ?
they &apos;re headed for kawika &apos;s house .
kawika .
what happened ?
someone torched the place .
sure you didn &apos;t do something to provoke this ?
bro , there &apos;s families here , kids .
i understand that , but their fathers are members of the kapu .
what are you trying to say , haole ?
kawika , listen ,
we got a dead shark tour operator ,
and his boats torched in the marina .
bunch of witnesses pointing their fingers at you and your boys .
all i &apos;m saying is , this could be payback .
hey , oh , chin , i need you to do me a favor , all right ?
i need you to pick up the victim &apos;s brother .
his name is craig brant .
thank you . run that in for me ?
yeah , just hold him until we get there .
look , i told you , my boys
had nothing to do with the torching of those shark boats .
and they sure as hell didn &apos;t kill jason brant .
we got witnesses
that say members of the kapu beat him up .
i don &apos;t know anything about that .
kawika , we want to believe you .
all right ? we do .
but your boys have been i.d. &apos; d .
we got to follow through .
if that &apos;s the case , then let me help you .
all right .
hey , who went and gave jason brant lickings ?
i &apos;m going to ask one more time .
who beat up jason brant ?
it was me , kawika .
why ?
answer the man .
this board belongs to my nephew koa .
he was surfing kammieland when a tiger shark went after him .
lucky thing , all he got was the board .
okay , i don &apos;t get it .
how was jason brant responsible for this ?
before he and his brother started these tours ,
sharks never came close to kammieland .
so , you @-@ you blame them for the attack ?
brah , my family &apos;s been surfing this break for over 60 years .
there &apos;s never been this many sharks so close to the shore .
those tours-- they teach sharks not to be afraid of humans .
and those tours are run by conservationists ,
okay , who have every right to be in the ocean ,
as much as you , me , anybody else .
we &apos;re not against sharing the ocean ,
but sharks that aren &apos;t afraid of humans
make it dangerous for every surfer and swimmer in the water .
right , like your nephew .
so , what , he gets attacked ,
you want revenge , and you go after jason . is that right ?
i just wanted to send a message .
tell them the truth , levi .
i am telling the truth .
okay , good .
i &apos;m gonna ask you one time . did you kill jason ,
burn his boat and get rid of the evidence ?
what ? ! no , no way . all i did was scare the guy .
i wasn &apos;t even on oahu last night .
i was judging a surf contest in maui .
all right .
we &apos;ll look into it .
we &apos;re gonna hold you on assault .
if your alibi checks out , you &apos;ll walk .
fair enough .
hey , what the hell &apos;s going on , huh ?
no one will tell me why i &apos;m here .
mr. brant , where were you two hours ago ?
what difference does it make ?
how does that help me find my brother &apos;s killer ?
doesn &apos;t .
excuse me ?
a fire was set to a house on the north shore two hours ago .
you know anything about it ?
look , all i know is , my brother &apos;s dead ,
and you &apos;re doing nothing about it .
well , it &apos;s an ongoing investigation .
maybe you &apos;d like to explain to me
how your fingerprints ended up on this discarded gas can
right by the crime scene .
eye for an eye .
it &apos;s in the bible .
so is , &quot; thou shalt not kill . &quot;
you skip that chapter or what ?
hey , my brother was murdered .
what , do you expect me to go back to work ?
no . we expect you to mourn ,
and then plan a funeral for your brother .
not go out and try burying more people .
come on , man . there were kids near that house .
something happens to them ,
you &apos;re gonna spend the rest of your life in prison .
listen , you lost family today .
we get that .
but torching a house full of innocent people--
that &apos;s no way to get even .
there was a luau , all right ?
they were all outside .
i made sure no one was in the house .
that make it okay ?
no .
i just ... i had ... i had to do something .
yeah , well , i got something for you .
the kapu didn &apos;t do it , okay ?
they got alibis . they all check out .
they may not like you .
they may not have liked your brother .
but they didn &apos;t kill anybody .
then who did ?
sorry , lieutenant . she said she knew you .
leilani .
is this a bad time ?
no , no . come in .
thanks , james .
um , this is a nice surprise .
uh , can i get you some coffee ,
a stale malasada ?
i thought cops didn &apos;t really eat donuts .
well , actually , that clich is true .
no , i just , um ... i @-@ i stopped by to say hi .
you never called .
you never gave me your number .
well , you &apos;re a cop ,
and it &apos;s 2013,
and i can &apos;t really be that hard to find .
you &apos;re right .
uh , the truth is , after what we went through ,
i thought you &apos;d never want to see my face again .
you saved my life .
we survived a prison riot together .
i was kind of looking forward to seeing
what you had in store for a second date .
leilani , there &apos;s nothing i &apos;d like more than to take you out .
but you &apos;re married .
i was .
when you &apos;re ready .
this is chin .
on my way .
you said on the phone you got something ?
yeah , a little show @-@ and @-@ tell .
kono and i looked into the reports
of the previous two shark boat arsons ,
and check this out .
in both cases ,
a time delay device was used to trigger the fires .
what is that ?
it &apos;s a pet food dispenser .
very much like this one .
so , you set the timer like this ...
and at the designated hour ,
the dispenser drops garfield his dinner .
that &apos;s very exciting .
but ...
if you &apos;re an inventive criminal
like our arsonist ,
it does more than just feed the kitty .
now you got my attention .
so , our perp put brake fluid in the dish
and crushed up pool chlorine tablets in the dispenser ,
and then he set the timer .
i take it. this is the show @-@ and @-@ tell part .
if you don &apos;t mind .
when the chlorine tablets hit the brake fluid , boom .
you get a chemical explosion .
obviously much larger than this .
and the timer allows the perp to flee the scene before it goes off .
i bet that voids the manufacturer &apos;s warranty .
and anyone standing within 50 yards of the blast .
now check this out .
the same setup that was used in the first two shark boats
was also used in a construction site arson two years ago .
did hpd have a suspect in the case ?
jimmy amana .
was he charged ?
no . the detectives had motive
but no way to link the evidence to him .
what was the motive ?
amana &apos;s old @-@ school hawaiian , so he believes
the land underneath the construction site was sacred .
a guy like that would object to the shark tours
for similar reasons .
you know how us locals worship our sharks .
they &apos;re sacred animals .
this information isn &apos;t new .
why didn &apos;t hpd question amana
about the shark boat fires ?
why don &apos;t we ask him ?
out of my way !
where the hell are you ? you &apos;re supposed to have my back !
you hear me ?
i need h ... i need help now !
all right , come on .
get up now .
get up . up .
now , that ... was impressive .
uh , i &apos;d give him a nine for degree of difficulty .
minus one for intelligence .
let &apos;s go .
let him go !
let him go now ! hey ! drop your weapons !
put the guns down and let him go .
stand down . stand down .
drop your weapons . put your guns down . let him go .
we &apos;re five @-@ o. drop your weapons .
i &apos;m not gonna tell you again .
drop your weapons .
fbi . this man is our ci .
he &apos;s working a major rico case for us .
okay , well , good for you ,
but he &apos;s coming with us .
amana &apos;s a suspect in our investigation .
with all due respect ,
our case is bigger than a couple of fires .
we gave this guy a pass on the arsons .
a pass ? well , while you guys were giving out
&quot; get out of jail free &quot; cards ,
there was another boat burned last night ,
and this time we have a dead body .
whoa . i didn &apos;t burn any more boats .
i didn &apos;t kill no one .
did you have eyes on him last night ?
not all night .
look , if he committed a murder
because you guys gave him too long a leash ,
you will be held accountable .
maybe you didn &apos;t hear us .
we &apos;re fbi , two years into a rico case .
you really think you can just pull the rug out ?
have a nice day .
i ask a question .
you act dumb .
we can play this game all day long .
what do you want me to say ?
i killed your guy ?
&apos;cause i didn &apos;t .
did i burn some boats ?
yeah . i did that .
but the feds looked the other way .
so , amana &apos;s alibi checks out .
the feds weren &apos;t on him last night ,
but i got a dozen degenerates that say
he was shooting craps at t.o.d.
but the m.o. &apos; s exactly the same .
not exactly . after fong &apos;s discovery ,
csu went back and did a second sweep of the crime scene ,
but they found no evidence to prove
that a pet dispenser was used as an incendiary device .
well , either this is a really bad frame job
or we &apos;re looking at a new m.o ..
hey , max .
what &apos;s this about another victim ?
behold .
gentlemen , allow me to introduce you to
isurus oxyrinchus , the mako shark ,
or simply mano , if you prefer .
i prefer you tell me what it &apos;s doing in your office .
well , a commercial fisherman caught this specimen today ,
and while they were gutting it for off @-@ island sale ,
they found this inside it .
lunch . that &apos;s nice .
any idea who ... that belongs to ?
well , i &apos;m running the prints through afis right now .
but i did find something quite compelling :
there are traces of buckshot in the arm .
that &apos;s the same ammo they use in bang sticks .
okay , so that could be the attacker
jason brant shot on his boat .
brilliant deduction , detective williams .
i ran dna , and it matched
the blood spatter found at the crime scene .
additional vascular analysis indicated that the victim
was very much alive when he was bitten .
well , if he survived ,
then we &apos;re looking for a one @-@ armed perp .
i asked hpd to reach out to the area hospitals .
no reports of walk @-@ ins with that kind of trauma .
and given the amount of blood loss , i doubt he survived .
so ...
this ... guy , he approaches jason at sea ,
jason shoots him with the ... fun stick
and goes overboard .
that &apos;s correct .
okay , but it does not explain
how he also was able to get jason into the shark tank
and set his boat on fire .
unless there was more than one attacker .
so , the prints from the arm came back to this guy ,
hal lewis .
prior to being shark lunch , he was a check bouncer .
he &apos;s also licensed as a commercial fisherman
and co @-@ owns a vessel you &apos;re familiar with : the carlyle .
i believe you interviewed his partners this morning .
yes , we did .
jay lappert and bruce kaneshiro .
yeah , so the story they told you about helping jason
after he was beaten up by the kapu ,
that &apos;s a fish tale .
wow , seriously ?
what ?
just keeping things thematic .
okay . i &apos;m thinking that these three
got into a confrontation with jason last night .
hal gets shot , the other two finish the job .
this was territorial .
if jason was dumping his shark tank into fishing waters ,
it was definitely messing with their haul .
messing with their livelihood .
it &apos;s financial incentive to shut the shark tours down .
hello , motive .
what happened to keeping it thematic ?
clear .
guys , back bedroom .
over here .
he &apos;s dead .
that &apos;s bruce kaneshiro .
what about jay lappert ?
no sign of him . the rest of the house is clear .
okay , so we got three partners .
one &apos;s dead here , the other &apos;s puzzle pieces
at the bottom of the ocean , and one &apos;s missing .
perps could have taken jay .
yeah , unless he &apos;s dead .
then where &apos;s the body ?
all right , thanks .
i got a missing persons alert out on jay lappert .
his boat is gone , too . the coast guard is on it .
all right , well , hpd ran his financials .
last week , jay and his buddies
spent $ 30,000 on diving equipment .
okay , fishermen just scraping by
don &apos;t spend 30 grand on diving equipment .
no , sub @-@ mariner doesn &apos;t spend $ 30,000 on diving equipment .
what are they doing with it ?
hey , guys , there &apos;s something you need to see . follow me .
oh , by the way , the , uh ... the sub @-@ mariner--
he doesn &apos;t need diving equipment ,
&apos;cause he can breathe underwater . ,
you mean prince namor ?
that &apos;s the sub @-@ mariner &apos;s real name .
i love it when you guys geek out .
all right , check this out .
this topographic dive map has an area circled
that &apos;s three miles off from haleiwa harbor .
that &apos;s the exact spot that we found jason &apos;s body .
looks like our three fishermen
were out there searching for something .
jason brant stumbles upon them ,
gets in the way , they kill him .
look what i found .
label &apos;s still damp , and it &apos;s got signs of saltwater erosion .
looks like our guys might have
recently pulled it from the water .
oyster sauce .
mm @-@ hmm , but ...
the drum &apos;s empty .
and that does not smell like any oyster sauce i &apos;ve ever had .
luckily , i don &apos;t know what oyster sauce smells like .
but i know what this smell is .
what , bad licorice ?
close .
it &apos;s mdma .
pharmaceutical @-@ grade ecstasy .
labs our narco squad used to hit
smelled exactly like this .
so that explains the map
and what our fishermen were after :
sunken treasure .
you rang ?
hey , charlie .
we &apos;re sending you over some evidence .
we think it &apos;s mdma .
but it &apos;s been exposed to salt water ,
so it &apos;s pretty eroded .
there is a logo stamped on it , uh ,
so what i &apos;m going to need you to do is enhance it , and then run it
through the logo database , see if we can
come up with a match to any known producer .
copy that .
if that thing was filled ,
that &apos;s a small fortune in x.
and the reason why someone &apos;s knocking off our fishermen .
the logo on the pill suggests that it was produced
by a taiwanese drug cartel the dea believes
has been smuggling ecstasy into hawaii
for the last 18 months .
a couple days ago , two suspected couriers
were arrested when they tried to fly onto oahu under the radar .
okay , let me guess .
there were no drugs on the plane when they searched it .
exactly .
they must have picked up dea surveillance
and ditched their load before they were grounded .
dea recorded the plane &apos;s flight path .
check it out .
they flew right over the area
where jason brant anchored his shark cases .
our fishermen were there , too .
so , i &apos;m thinking maybe they see
the cargo get dropped in the water ,
figure it &apos;s contraband , decide to take it .
until jason brant crashes their party .
he thinks they &apos;re activists
vandalizing his shark cages .
by the time he figures out what
they &apos;re actually doing , they killed him .
all right , now these idiots
are sitting on a ton of dope worth a lot money .
wait a minute .
wait , wait , wait .
that &apos;s why we can &apos;t find jay .
he &apos;s not dead . he &apos;s got the x.
what are you thinking , he took out his partners ?
100 % is ... is way sweeter than splitting it three ways .
if you can unload it , yeah .
hold on . yeah ?
yeah , we &apos;re on our way . okay , that was kono .
coast guard found jay &apos;s boat , the carlyle .
it &apos;s docked at a terminal facility on sand island .
thanks , charlie .
kono , secure the perimeter .
go . go .
five @-@ o ! hey !
put it down , on the floor . right now .
now !
keep your hands where we can see them .
get your hands behind your head .
interlace your fingers .
you , put your hands in front of you .
put them in front of you .
interlock your fingers .
i know , our timing &apos;s horrible .
get down !
hold your fire ! hold your fire !
it &apos;s three weeks to taipei , gentlemen .
enjoy the trip .
please , man , don &apos;t put me in there .
you don &apos;t have to worry about that , mr. lappert .
killing cops is bad for business .
but killing a thief who tried to steal from me ,
well , that &apos;s hard to overlook .
whoa , whoa , whoa . i &apos;m sorry .
i @-@ i didn &apos;t know they were your drugs ! i swear !
but you knew they belonged to someone else .
and yet you still elected to help yourself
and try to broker a deal with my competition .
the buddhists have an old saying :
&quot; i am of the nature to die .
there &apos;s no way to escape death &quot; &quot;
get up .
get up .
well , cuz , when did you learn how to operate a crane ?
first time . just winged it .
book him , kono .
oh . where &apos;s the love ?
she earned this one .
thanks , boss .
i want to see a lawyer .
oh , we &apos;re working on getting you a public defender ,
but no one could believe you &apos;re actually this stupid .
we could dig johnnie cochran up and get him back to work ,
but even he couldn &apos;t get you out of jail .
so , let &apos;s see-- you stole drugs from a cartel ,
and then you killed jason brant
because he saw you do it ,
and then you whack out your own partners .
so , man , i feel like i should just shoot you right now ,
save the taxpayers money for your trial and life in prison .
the only thing i can &apos;t work out is : why would you and bruce
throw hal overboard after jason brant shot him ?
why would you do that ?
hal was bleeding pretty bad .
he wasn &apos;t going to make it .
so , instead of rushing him to the hospital ,
you just decided to sacrifice him to the sharks ?
wow , you are a real humanitarian , you know that ?
okay , what about bruce ?
he was freaking out .
said he couldn &apos;t live with himself after what we did .
he was gonna go to the cops , man .
okay , well , you got to shut him up , right ?
that &apos;s good . so now you &apos;re gonna do time for all three murders ,
and turns out it was all for nothing .
the drugs you went to all that trouble to steal ,
they &apos;re worthless .
what are you talking about ?
the lab tested the ecstasy ,
and the precursor chemicals that they use to make the ecstasy ...
were tainted .
yeah . taking those pills would take you
to the same place as a breath mint .
anyway ...
i hope it was all worth it .
this is so stupid . it &apos;s so stupid .
i can &apos;t believe i let you talk me into this .
we had a deal .
you said if kamekona passed his flight exam ,
you &apos;d fly .
okay , well , next time i say something stupid
like that again , punch me in the mouth .
happily .
thank you .
seriously , though , now that you &apos;re up here ,
you &apos;re glad you came , right ?
no , no . exactly the opposite .
every fiber of my being is telling me
i should not be in this helicopter right now .
if we go down ,
i &apos;ll look after grace for you .
don &apos;t worry , brah .
oh , you will ? how you gonna ...
thank you , kamekona .
shoots , don &apos;t even mention it .
well , kamekona , i am perfectly comfortable
with your aviation prowess , so ...
please , continue your tour .
i ... forgot where i was .
you guys are making me lose concentration .
okay , okay ,
that &apos;s not what i want to hear from the pilot , okay ?
on your left ,
aloha tower .
it was opened september 11 , 1926 .
and did you know in world war ii , aloha tower ...
hey ! come on , man !
relax , brah .
eyes on the road , big guy .
okay ?
how about we buzz the coastline ?
up ahead ,
that &apos;s the one and only magic island .
built on shallow reef in &apos; 64,
it was supposed to become a big hotel .
never finished &apos; em , though . better this way .
the beautiful hilton hawaiian village ,
a resort fit for a king .
elvis stayed here in &apos; 57 .
what are you doing ?
you getting a seizure ? stop it .
i just ... felt the magnum p.i. theme was appropriate .
oh , i used to love that show .
higgy baby was the man .
i was very fond of higgins myself .
and commander mcgarrett shares the same
navy seal lineage as magnum ,
and ...
and what ? what ? i &apos;m not rick , okay ?
well , everyone can agree that you &apos;re
commander mcgarrett &apos;s humorous sidekick .
and if we &apos;re playing this game ,
it &apos;s obvious who i am :
