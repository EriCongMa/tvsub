you can &apos;t see &apos; em.i &apos;m too vain . anyway ...
johnny was very proud of you .
you were very special to him .
i &apos;m sure you were too .
johnny told me if i ever needed anything
i should always call his son .
what do you need ?
not a thing .
fran felstein ?
that was class
she &apos;s got great legs for an old broad .
i was in love with that woman .
she was the reason i never married .
i wanted to propose .
i had the ring all picked out
so what ? she turned you down ?
i hesitated .
how could i bring this life we live on a woman ?
anyway , she took it as a sign i wasn &apos;t interested .
then one night we were all at the 500 club to see enzo stuarti .
your father shows up .
sy devore suit ,
two @-@ inch lapel
that was that .
she never knew my feelings . what could i do ?
for years , i suffered in silence .

nobody wants to hear me .
mario , remember ?
thanks , my name &apos;s jt . i &apos;m an alcoholic and an addict .
hi , jt .
i &apos;m also a tv writer which , by default , makes me a douche bag ,
but you would &apos;ve figured that out for yourselves .
about 15 years ago , i moved from jersey to hollywood
broke into the biz.it was a dream come true
i had money , i had the beemer , the actress girlfriend .
best of all , i had all the flake
i needed to keep me churning out that snappy dialogue .
drugs , alcohol
that shit practically comes with the writers &apos; guild card .
anyway ,
before too long , i discovered heroin .
then things really started to fall apart .
it got so bad that i blew a deadline on a nash bridges .
i got my ass fired . i didn &apos;t work for 18 months .
by the grace of god , i got myself into a rehab programme in pennsylvania
and , with the help of some good friends that i made there ,
i got through it .
chris , where are you ?
there &apos;s my man chris , everybody .
anyway , i wanna talk a little bit about takin &apos; a moral inventory .
so we talked for , like , an hour .
well , it turns out that they had a thing ,
her and my old man . right up till he died .
he got from this woman what he couldn &apos;t get at home .
support ... you know , love .
a smile when you walk in the fuckin &apos; door .
do you think that justifies his infidelity ?
she drove him into that woman &apos;s arms , my mother .
. to all his women .
i &apos;ll tell you one thing . over the years he was rottin &apos; in that grave
i can &apos;t remember once my mother goin &apos; to visit him .
but this lady , fran ...
it &apos;s possible your mother found it very painful .
oh , poor
her.what was it like sitting there with fran ?
a little weird at first ...
here i am comforting my father &apos;s mistress ã€‚
my mother &apos;s lyin &apos; there , dead .
are you attracted to her ?
she &apos;s old enough to be my mother !
oh , jesus christ , it &apos;s an expression .
don &apos;t cream yourself .
i did not want to fuck my mother !
you should &apos;ve seen her in her hairnet .
this conversation &apos;d be over in two seconds .
so , i figured , why not move back to jersey ?
clean slate . it &apos;s better .
my new agent ? next week , he &apos;s got me set up to meet dick wolf &apos;s guy .
i seen dick wolf at rao &apos;s one night .

my mother made him give the dog away .
well , bruce loved him .
he had him for almost ten years , till he moved to tel aviv .
then i had to put him to sleep .
those are the pictures , on the coffee table .
the slippers were your dad &apos;s , too .
look at this . the two of you .
he used to remind me of victor mature .
outside the latin quarter .
holy shit , look at hesh . george gershwin .
he was a whoremaster , and cheap .
he screwed me out of my retirement money .
against your dad &apos;s wishes , by the way .
what are you talkin &apos; about ?
don &apos;t get me started .
come on , what happened ? - your dad owned a racetrack .
with the midget auto racing .
the chickamauga raceway over in new egypt .
him , herman , some other guy ...
phil something . with the hair , from new york .
leotardo .
my father cut him in to pay off a poker debt .
johnny always told me his piece would go to me .
couldn &apos;t put me in his will , obviously .
when he passed , your dad ...
i called hesh .
he sent me 500 bucks.that &apos;s it ?
i &apos;m sorry .
jesus christ , i wish you &apos;d called me .
bruce sends me money occasionally .
that &apos;s not the point . it &apos;s my father &apos;s wishes .
look , forget it .
seriously , i &apos;m sorry .
i shouldn &apos;t have even brought it up .
listen , after we eat , you wanna take a ride ?
so i saw my uncle jun &apos; .
he says to say hello .
junior ?
jesus . how &apos;s he doing ?
i don &apos;t know if you know it ,
but he was always a little hot for you .
he was practically a stalker .
he said he suffered in silence .
suffered in silence ?
he used to skulk outside my building , all hours .
weird phone calls .
i always had a hunch he told livia about me and johnny .
jesus christ .
she was a handsome woman , your mother .
not sexy , exactly , but statuesque .
little nip ?
what is it ?
one for the road , honey .
and this looks like road to me .
vsop .
they can &apos;t be making much , but if i know hesh
him and phil got something going on here .
so , tell me about your women .
your wife , what &apos;s she like ?
i don &apos;t know .
what &apos;s to tell ?
good woman , good mother .
marriage hit the rocks , that &apos;s all . what are you gonna do ?
how about your girlfriend ?
she &apos;s an art dealer . very sophisticated .
dark hair , dark eyes . she &apos;s latin .
you know , from spain .
that &apos;s it .
oh , man , i &apos;m so glad you called .
i really needed this .
so ?
so , what ?
there &apos;s nothing you wanna talk about ?
i was honest with you the other night .
you &apos;re telling me you &apos;re not using ?
what ?
you ran out of ihop like you were on fire and jonesing like a motherfucker .
i was going with a girl to the track . the meadowlands .
i didn &apos;t wanna miss the last race .
i am totally clean and sober .
jesus christ . i was positive you fucking slipped .
thank you , man . i appreciate your concern .
i could have saved you a trip .
i &apos;ll take your action .
you take a dime each on the yankees and st. louis ?
whoa , high roller .
i just got a three grand residual on a that &apos;s life episode .
what , that fake guinea @-@ fest with paul sorvino ?
that was totally unrealistic .
so dusty here .
that silk ?
it ain &apos;t kleenex .
it &apos;s linen .
you know , you &apos;re very ...
i don &apos;t know , you got a lot of class .
just like your girlfriend .
he told me to look out for her so i sent her some money .
no one else did .
so you keep his end for yourself ?
i should give it to some trollop ? besides , i thought i had it coming .
with leotardo in the can , who &apos;s been running that place , huh ?
collecting the rent , filing the taxes , all that ?
what about my share ? all those years , i never saw a dime .
you &apos;re my father &apos;s friend , hesh . my friend !
so how come i never see you ?
what ?
i see you . i &apos;m fucking busy .
never too busy to call me at two am to hear your problems .
one time , that happened .
my therapist was on vacation .
you want his end , kid , you got it . it &apos;s 25 per cent
the closing is not for two weeks .
and i would appreciate it if you tell
leotardo he should assume part of that burden .
well , despite how you feel , my father loved this woman .
she &apos;s not such a bad person , but i don &apos;t know .
something about her always rubbed me the wrong way .
maybe cos she was rubbing him and not you .
how long you know me , bub , huh ?
she &apos;s a little pale for my taste .
mr patronella was last week .
this is a different one .
yes , i &apos;m aware he &apos;s been to two funerals in a month .
well , people die , counselor .
the deceased in question now , mrs crilley ,
was the sister of mr soprano &apos;s cousin .
by marriage .
so she &apos;s not a blood relative per se .
for god &apos;s sake , the man wants to pay his respects .
well , perhaps my next call should be to judge runions .
five hours , it &apos;s not a hawaiian vacation .
he &apos;ll attend the church service
then pay his respects to the family .
thank you , counselor . we appreciate it .
you &apos;re worth every fucking cent !
they &apos;re gonna have scottish bagpipes at the funeral .
it should be interesting .
don provolone . see that fucking game ?
diet coke and whatever he &apos;s having .
ginger ale ?
remind me to send jeter a dozen roses .
you wanna parlay it ?
i was thinking i &apos;d check out that indian casino , play some poker .

high stakes , exclusive clientele .
david lee roth .
i &apos;ll tell you , man .
playing cards , games of chance ,
i never really dug it before .
i was never that good at math .
but there &apos;s something about that excitement that &apos;s so ...
i don &apos;t know .
what is wrong ? i win a bet , you look like you &apos;re gonna cry .
i fucked up again .
my super came by this morning to fucking caulk around the toilet .
he had some weed . -
before you use , you have got to call someone
i know , i know .
i just wanted to see if i could get high like a normal person .
you &apos;re not normal . neither of us are .
on top of that , you ask me to meet you at a bar ?
come here , you maniac .
625k for the track plus all that land ? that &apos;s it ?
that &apos;s it ?
zoning restrictions . we &apos;re lucky we got a buyer at all .

of jack &apos;s from choate , but of course we had no idea .
he insists that we join him for some affair at the pierre hotel .
he won &apos;t take no .
he has a limo , we figure , &quot; what the hell ? &quot;
we go over and he tells us
he &apos;s taking us to the presidential suite .

we go in the suite . it is crawling with models , celebrities .
peter lawford , sinatra .

he takes my coat , he brings me a cocktail ,
introduces me around .
finally , at the end of the night , and get this .
in the interests of national security , he says he needs me to stay .
since i &apos;m wearing a sable , he needs to personally interview me .
make sure i &apos;m not working for the russians .
he said that ?

the day we met , i told you we were at the cemetery to bury his wife ,
my aunt concetta .
70 years , they were together .
poor guy &apos;s taking it very hard .
oh ! my knight in shining armour !
so ?
good morning to you , too .
you got it ?
jesus , you are a fucking trip .
i &apos;m jt by the way .
what is this ? pulp fiction ?

i don &apos;t know . i didn &apos;t see it .
you &apos;re really being a prick . i told you , i need more time .
i don &apos;t have the money .
get it .
you know me . what could you do to me that i haven &apos;t already been through ?
i &apos;m positive we &apos;ll think of something .
and 66 years after taking those sacred vows , &quot; till death do us part , &quot;
and 66 years after
concetta left him and went home to god .
in the two weeks that followed , nicolo struggled without her ,
finally succumbing to irredeemable loss .
the enormity of his grief can hardly be imagined .
how much they went through together -
seeing their children grow
and looking joyfully on as their grandchildren had children .
sickness and health ,
good times and bad
but through it all , one thing remained constant .
they had each other .
it was nicolo &apos;s love for concetta that made him leave this earth
a mere 15 days after she left him .
we take comfort knowing they &apos;re together again ,
seated at the foot of our lord .
let us join together in prayer .
hail , mary , full of grace ,
the lord is with thee .
blessed art thou among women
and blessed is the fruit of thy womb , jesus .
holy mary , mother of god ,
pray for us sinners , now and at the hour of our death ,
amen .
junior , what &apos;s the matter ?
