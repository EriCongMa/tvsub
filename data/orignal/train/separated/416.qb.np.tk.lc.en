i don &apos;t want to be spider @-@ man anymore .
why not ?
i don &apos;t know .
ok . well
you have to make up your mind by tomorrow ok ?
ok .
ok .
you did a good job on the cookies .
teamwork right ?
teamwork right .
can i have one ?
you want a cookie ?
can i have a cookie ?
what do you want black cat or a pumpkin ?
black cat .
black cat . good choice .
the cool thing about halloween
is that it &apos;s a uniquely american holiday .
i mean despite it &apos;s obvious origins in the celtic festival
of samhain and the christian all saints day
it really is a melting pot
of various immigrants &apos; traditions and beliefs .
it became a little more
commercialized in the 1950s with trick @-@ or @-@ reat
and today it rivals only christmas in terms of popularity .
all i asked was what he was doing this weekend .
i &apos;m toying with the notion
of either going to the edgar allan poe shadow puppet theater
or the reenactment of the 19th century phantasmagoria .
i don &apos;t want to know .
oh yeah you do .
phantasmagorias are these amazing pre @-@ cinema projected ghost shows
invented in france
where the showman attempted to spook the audience
using science magic . and it just so happens
that i have an extra ticket .
tempting .
guys i wouldn &apos;t have to worry
about losing my feminine curves
if you all paid more attention
to all the trees we &apos;re consuming around here .
when did you become an eco @-@ freak ?
baby i was born green .
we &apos;re going to detroit .
it &apos;s halloween weekend .
arson investigators have noticed a 3 @-@ year trend
in the days leading up to halloween .
devil &apos;s night .
this unsub is killing only these 3 days out of the year .
how &apos;s he doing it ?
he &apos;s burning his victims alive .
he &apos;s abducting seemingly random people
and dumping their bodies in abandoned parts of town .
he struck again last night .
yeah . tony torrell 40 .
he lives in the suburbs but he was found 20 miles away
in the rivertown district .
he &apos;s attacking the city at its most vulnerable time .
what does he do during the rest of the year ?
he &apos;s dormant .
you know
arsonists are typically white males between 17 and 25
who can &apos;t stay away from fire .
yeah they &apos;re addicted to it and there &apos;s no rehab .
and they target dwellings not people .
so you &apos;re saying he burns
his victims alive but he &apos;s not an arsonist ?
fire is simply his weapon .
and devil &apos;s night gives him the perfect cover to kill .
then we &apos;ve got 48 hours before he disappears again .
well his last victim was athletic .
he wouldn &apos;t be easy to subdue .
the offender must be just as strong
or might have an upper hand if he &apos;s younger .
still how does he transport his victims across the city
and get them inside buildings
without being noticed ?
niccolo machiavelli wrote
&quot; if an injury has to be done to a man
&quot; it should be so severe
that his vengeance need not be feared . &quot;
now i thought devil &apos;s night was halloween eve .
the moniker &quot; devil &apos;s night &quot; is somewhat deceiving .
in detroit
it &apos;s actually a 3 @-@ day
citywide cultural phenomenon
complete with masks chaos and costumes .
say that 3 times fast .
sounds like mardi gras .
yeah a violent one .
vandals and amateur arsonists literally
set hundreds of fires .
who burns their own city ?
it started as pranks in the 1930s
but escalated in the 1970s with disenfranchised youth .
well given today &apos;s economy
it must be a free @-@ for @-@ all .
they &apos;ve got record @-@ breaking unemployment
and foreclosures
leaving a lot of displaced desperate people .
and every single one of these victim
suffered unimaginable pain .
i &apos;m sure that &apos;s what gets him off watching them burn .
it gives him power and control .
the top of the whodunit list is first responders .
firefighters arson investigators
cops and paramedics .
civil servants with a hero complex .
all of whom will be helping us .
this guy &apos;s angry .
aren &apos;t they all ?
not like this .
have you seen these ?
extreme anger usually manifests from a quick temper
but this guy &apos;s patient .
i &apos;m gonna ask garcia to notify us
the minute that someone &apos;s reported missing .
burns 3 people annually .
it &apos;s like his christmas .
and the rest of the year he just plans--
targeting his victims and then choosing
the buildings he wants to kill them in .
there &apos;s a flaw in his plan .
we know about it .
we &apos;re stretched as it is
but we &apos;ve set up a joint task force
with the detroit p.d. to catch this guy .
it &apos;s pretty extensive .
i &apos;d say don &apos;t profile me
but you &apos;re in a roomful of suspects right ?
a city full .
victims abducted across every socioeconomic divide .
and this son of a bitch
is about to burn a few of them alive .
problem is we &apos;ve gotta catch up .
and we know he &apos;s gonna be watching .
well we &apos;re gonna bust him this year .
we &apos;ve got two agents on the way
to last night &apos;s crime scene .
great . i &apos;ll meet them there .
i hope we find something soon .
it gets dark early this time of year .
and we &apos;ll head to the morgue .
hope you have a strong stomach .
gasoline was the accelerant ?
gas vapors collect in a low enclosed space .
when he ignited those vapors burned down to his bone .
we call this a fourth @-@ degree burn .
there &apos;s a fracture on the back of his skull .
that &apos;s right .
was that postmortem ?
no it was antemortem bruising .
he was struck from behind .
blitz attack .
what &apos;s this on her face ?
charred fabric . all of the victims
have the same material on them .
the fire fused the original garment to his flesh
then burned away leaving behind these remains .
he &apos;s covering their faces ?
that &apos;s my best guess yes .
he doesn &apos;t want his victims looking at him
even though he wants to watch them die .
it could be a sign of guilt or inadequacy .
now wouldn &apos;t a guy like this
want to see the terror in their eyes ?
instead he keeps them in the dark .
he &apos;s covering their faces and setting them on fire .
it &apos;s an execution .
it &apos;s easy to see why he sets fires down here .
it &apos;s completely isolated .
he can beat torture or burn somebody
and nobody would hear it .
i never thought the fbi would be here
for our fine city &apos;s tradition .
i &apos;m al garner with the dfd .
agents morgan and prentiss .
i guess devil &apos;s night keeps you pretty busy huh ?
not as much as it did in the eighties .
used to get up to 600.700 fires back then .
in 3 days ?
down to 115 last year .
it still takes everything we got
but fortunately we &apos;ve had some help .
have the police increased their patrols in the rivertown district ?
i wish they could but the city &apos;s reeling from budget cuts .
no . detroit &apos;s finest is a community group
with over a thousand volunteers .
a thousand volunteers ?
well that just added another thousand names to garcia &apos;s list .
do you think he &apos;s one of them ?
can &apos;t rule anyone out .
what is this place ?
it &apos;s an old engine factory .
it &apos;s massive .
and medieval .
from the industrial age
when this city was pumping out more cars and hit songs
than any place else in the world .
this is where we found tony &apos;s charred remains .
the char pattern tracks back to here .
that &apos;s where he stood when he started the fire .
not the best vantage point .
there &apos;s your escape exit .
yeah except he didn &apos;t want that .
he needs to watch the show .
this is the moment he &apos;s been waiting for all year .
one where he doesn &apos;t feel inadequate or rejected .
so he watches as long as he can .
yeah but fire &apos;s unpredictable .
every second in here he &apos;s putting his own life at risk .
and this guy &apos;s obviously confident
that he can get out of here before it &apos;s too late .
but there was a fire alarm .
my men were here in 5 minutes .
and he knew it .
how ?
this unsub doesn &apos;t leave anything to chance .
he knows exactly how long he &apos;s got with his victims .
he probably knows response times
or at least listens to them .
all units be advised of a robbery in progress at 9760 east mills .
this is your man dj cutz with an instant blast .
the feds are in town cracking down on this year &apos;s devil &apos;s night .
so i &apos;d advise everyone to stay off of the streets
and keep them radios locked to fm 99 detroit .
this city is being watched by detroits &apos; finest .
the first time i looked at these victims on the map
none of it made sense .
7 different victims various ages sex and ethnicity .
what do you see now ?
the first victim ...
often tells us the most .
tommy proctor .
well his rap sheet is longer than the nile .
it looks like he &apos;s always walked on the dark side .
the first kill inspired him .
what &apos;s different about it ?
two things . first of all his body wasn &apos;t found for days .
he was buried deep in the building .
that often tells us that they know each other .
not to mention it took many botched attempts to burn them .
because the unsub didn &apos;t realize
how difficult it is to actually burn a human body .
or it &apos;s overkill . he wanted proctor to suffer the most .
which definitely makes it personal .
if he knew the first victim
it &apos;s a good chance he knew them all .
we just have to find out how .
we can start by talking to tony torrell &apos;s wife .
how you doing ?
uh ... i &apos;m fine .
uh i &apos;m here to see agent rossi .
he &apos;s going to be with you in just a few minutes .
i &apos;m agent prentiss .
oh i &apos;m kiersten torrell .
uh ... my husband tony was killed last night .
i know .
and i &apos;m very sorry .
may i sit down ?
oh yeah .
are--are you working on his case ?
yes i am .
is there a picture of him in your folder ?
i want to see him .
kiersten uh your husband was very badly burned .
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s a good idea .
what do you mean he was burnt ?
the person who did this uses fire as a weapon .
was tony set on fire alive ?
we don &apos;t know that--
oh my god .
oh my god this can &apos;t be happening .
ohh ... next week was our anniversary .
i &apos;m so sorry .
are you married ?
no i &apos;m not and i can &apos;t imagine what you &apos;re going through .
but everything you tell us
can help us find the person who did this to tony .
i know this is hard
but i want you to try to remember that
when you &apos;re talking to agent rossi .
now i &apos;d like you to close your eyes and relax .
i want to walk you through
an exercise that &apos;s going to help you recall everything that happened last night .
what like hypnosis ?
no no no . not at all .
now just close your eyes and do the best that you can . ok ?
all right .
think about last night .
you and tony you went to the halloween festival in greektown .
what time was it ?
uh around 9 : 30 .
crowded ?
yeah .
uh there were drums and loud music
some people wore costumes .
tony and i went to the festival every year .
we actually met there when we were in high school .
but this year we decided not to dress up .
what is it ?
a kid dressed in a mask jumped out scared me .
it made tony laugh .
where &apos;s his mama ?
what type of mask ?
uh round like a baby .
ok . what do you see next ?
fire .
they were grilling lamb
and uh people were cheering .
all right . it was a greek restaurant .
baby me and gyros ?
no thanks .
what ?
i &apos;m gonna go check out this mexican food .
oh baby no .
baby i &apos;m be right back .
all right . i &apos;ll come and get you .
all right .
now do you remember anyone in the crowd
anyone that didn &apos;t fit in ?
no .
but to be honest i was already looking at the menu .
all right that &apos;s good . now don &apos;t look up from the menu .
just listen to me .
when you love someone and they step away
there &apos;s an instinctive response to glance up
to make sure that they &apos;re still there .
now you did that last night even if you don &apos;t remember .
ok . you &apos;re getting ready to place an order .
i already know what i &apos;m getting . i &apos;m getting the gyro .
kiersten where &apos;s tony ?
he &apos;s at the mexican restaurant .
is someone around him ?
yes .
uh but i can &apos;t really make out his face .
what about his body ? is it young ? is it old ?
uh ... 25 maybe .
wait .
he &apos;s wearing a mask .
like the kid ?
no no no no no .
it only covers one side of his face .
his ear is gone .
and um ...
what do you see ?
it &apos;s a black guy .
he &apos;s black .
you make him sound like he &apos;s freddy krueger or something .
no but i do think he &apos;s severely burned .
it explains why he chooses this time of the year .
he doesn &apos;t have to hide his scars .
what about his victims ?
he &apos;s punishing them for wronging him .
wronging him ? what about his second victim ?
have you looked at josephine davis &apos; life ?
she was the nicest woman in the world .
how did she wrong this guy ?
he &apos;s had interactions with all of his victims
some more personal than others .
so he &apos;s acting out of revenge .
kiersten and tony didn &apos;t even speak to him .
maybe not that night
but at some point in the past .
now wait a minute .
josephine was abducted from her husband .
tony was abducted from his wife .
you think these couples represent the happiness he covets ?
or something he lost .
he &apos;s a young guy with a deformity .
major insecurities come with that .
a trauma like that would be devastating for him
and anyone in his life .
daddy ?
daddy ?
daddy !
please please daddy !
daddy !
daddy !
daddy !
daddy please !
do you know how rare it is for an arsonist to be a burn victim ?
less than 3.5 % .
this guy &apos;s not an arsonist .
he &apos;s a serial killer who uses fire .
and that choice of weapon tells us that he &apos;s aggressive
driven and destructive just like fire itself .
but why would someone so controlling
choose the most unpredictable weapon ?
this juxtaposition tells us
there &apos;s more going on with him than we realize .
he &apos;s probably experienced some kind of loss
these past few years that started him down this path .
we should look at accidents where couples were burned .
we &apos;re talking about hundreds of fires .
focusing on ones where gasoline was the accelerant .
leaving his victims in the heart of rivertown
in the center of these buildings themselves
may be subconscious on his part
but it says that this affected his very core .
all right hold on . somebody else has just been abducted .
how do we know this is our guy ?
because his daughter said a monster took her daddy away .
kaman !
kaman come on man .
what are you doing ? my little girl &apos;s back there .
you gotta let me go .
the victim &apos;s name is christopher edwards .
he &apos;s 35 . he lives in the suburbs .
what part ?
birmingham .
how far is that from the rivertown district ?
not more than 40 minutes .
he might already be inside .
let &apos;s lock it down . we &apos;ll trap him .
i &apos;m going down there .
i &apos;ll go with you .
garcia have detroit p.d. set up roadblocks .
got it .
chris edwards is a husband he &apos;s a father
he &apos;s a general contractor .
i would check any subcontractors who &apos;ve worked with him .
ok that is a humungous list . what do you want me to do with it ?
anything that requires flames--plumbers electricians welders .
did he fire a welder recently ?
ok . uh he &apos;s been using vinnie &apos;s welding and fence
but he hasn &apos;t hired them back in months .
list of employees coming up .
it &apos;s still a lofty handful .
ok we think he &apos;s been following the investigation .
look at volunteers with detroit &apos;s finest .
ok i &apos;m crossing employees with volunteers .
nothing .
come on baby girl keep checking .
there &apos;s gotta be a connection here .
ok i &apos;m gonna long @-@ shot it and i &apos;m gonna cross
the michigan business directory with the payroll company
and see if i still got what it takes to find stuff .
and i do . his name &apos;s kaman scott .
you got an address ?
i &apos;m working on that .
kaman .
kaman come on man .
kaman you gotta let me go . please let me go .
what do you want ?
i &apos;ll give you anything you want . you want money ?
you want a job ?
just don &apos;t do anything stupid man all right ?
damn it come on man !
ok from the look of kaman scott &apos;s early years
he was on a fast track to
be some kind of hoodlum bad boy super convict
but something happened in 2004 that made him change his evil tune
&apos;cause then there &apos;s no arrests there &apos;s no suspicions
there &apos;s no sign of rehab but he totally cleaned up .
maybe that &apos;s when he met someone .
has he ever been arrested with a man named tommy proctor ?
yeah once uh 2002 ...
yikes and then they collided again in 2005
like literally collided .
kaman was in an accident and his car blew up .
well there &apos;s your gas accelerant .
he was hit by that guy tommy proctor .
there &apos;s your revenge .
twist of fate . the life he left behind came back to haunt him .
so tommy walks away without a scratch
and kaman suffers a ton of third @-@ degree burns
had a boatload of skin grafts
was in a coma for a couple of months
lost his apartment .
oh and then there &apos;s that guy--
his landlord was tony torrell .
so we were right . he does have a revenge list .
what about family friends acquaintances ?
no that kaman is a lone wolf .
and his address just came up .
big bad lives at 5923 mills .
clear here .
clear .
it &apos;s like a cave .
this guy hides out all year long .
with burns like that he &apos;s probably sensitive to light .
and his own skin .
when you look around there &apos;s not a mirror in sight .
this guy doesn &apos;t want any reminder of what he looks like .
there &apos;s nothing personal in here .
well we said he &apos;d have nothing to live for .
for a planner like kaman tonight &apos;s abduction was irrational .
he went on private property and took chris edwards
with a witness present .
maybe he &apos;s finally starting
to feel the pressure and he &apos;s reactive .
more than that he &apos;s meticulous .
he &apos;d have a plan if he got cornered .
he &apos;d have an endgame .
well he already killed the man he blames for his accident .
the other victims are slights compared to that .
and now he needs to hurt the person that hurt him the most .
the one who drives all of this .
the one who broke his heart .
yeah but who the hell is that ?
i swear i won &apos;t tell anybody about this .
aah ! aah ! son of a bitch !
oh god !
i &apos;m sorry man .
i &apos;m so sorry .
it wasn &apos;t my call .
no ! what are you doing ? !
what are you doing ? !
no kaman please no !
oh god ! let me go !
kaman scott worked for chris edwards .
he was fired 7 months ago .
why did he kill him here ?
roadblocks forced him out of his comfort zone .
anything in the van ?
welding equipment cans of gasoline .
and a cage .
i &apos;m getting everyone in the city down here on this .
without his car he &apos;s going to lie in wait until he can &apos;t anymore .
then he &apos;s gonna lash out again .
prentiss .
i think i found something .
what do you got ?
a girl .
there &apos;s two more of the same girl in here .
oh jeez we gotta find out who she is .
if this guy &apos;s feeling cornered all bets are off .
tonight &apos;s his last chance to
get revenge on anyone who &apos;s ever wronged him .
she &apos;s most likely his next target .
garcia we &apos;re gonna send you some photographs .
what do you want me to do with them ?
blow up the background see if you can find anything
that tells us who this girl is .
i &apos;ll hit you back .
uh @-@ uh ! we &apos;re closed !
no you are not .
not to me .
boy what &apos;s wrong with you ? get out .
not tonight .
where is she ?
where is tracy ?
kaman i said ...

i can &apos;t .
i can &apos;t do that tonight . they comin &apos; after me .
what have you done ?
i just need to see her .
