&quot; hard bargain &quot;
i am telling you , once we got these doctors talking ,
it was a horror show .
shh . i just got sofia back down .
oh , and , uh , portland gen has quotas now .
yeah . it &apos;s unspoken , but it &apos;s understood
that you have to churn out a certain number of procedures .
and no research ?
nope . pegasus is only interested
in high @-@ volume , high @-@ price @-@ tag procedures .
barely any patient interaction .
so no research , no innovation ,
no opportunity to do what it is we got into medicine to do .
well , we won &apos;t let that happen to us here .
oh , yeah ? that &apos;s what they said at first .
and then the people that fought management got fired ,
and the rest wore down or they left .
they say there &apos;s one sure sign
of a successful negotiation .
now i don &apos;t want to leave . none of us do .
you guys , come on . we have to do this .
we have to buy the hospital .
whoa . hold on .
maybe she &apos;s right .
just wait .
it &apos;s that when the parties leave the table ...
what if we don &apos;t want to ?
they both feel like they &apos;ve been screwed .
yes . ah , yes .
is it--is it this ?
or ... or that ?
oh , that . oh , exactly that .
the goal is a compromise ...
okay .
your turn .
a situation where everybody wins .
i &apos;m sorry . it &apos;s never been my dream to run a hospital .
okay , well , you might not have to run it .
cristina should be here .
i have been texting her .
i just got back to work .
and , derek , you just got your hand back .
don &apos;t you want to just work ?
work where ?
i don &apos;t want somebody telling me
which patients i can and can &apos;t treat .
or putting a stopwatch
on how much time you can spend with them .
yeah , if we ran the place ,
we could make policy decisions based on experience . do y--
uh , no offense , but that is a naive way of putting it .
the job is much harder than you think .
i wanted it once , and i hated it .
we should stay the course .
i made a deal with pegasus
that apparently will help the sale .
what ... deal ?
nothing , it &apos;s stupid .
but maybe that &apos;s how we make it work ,
from the inside .
what about hunt ?
i mean , he &apos;s pushing for the pegasus sale .
he thinks it &apos;s a good deal .
so what &apos;s he gonna say ?
oh , it &apos;s cahill .
you know , she just wants to strategize .
at 3 a.m. ?
i bet she does .
you know the nurses are threatening a walkout ,
and i have to talk them down ?
you know what ? no .
let &apos;s just not talk about this .
i just want to be here for a few hours with you
where there are no problems .
you know , the sale to pegasus closes in three days .
and cahill says the buyers are getting twitchy ,
and if there is a mass exodus of the staff--
even if there &apos;s a tiny exodus--
i mean , basically if anybody leaves ,
then the buyers are gonna back out ,
and we lose the sale , and ...
the hospital closes .
that &apos;s not gonna happen .
you sure ?
maybe ?
you can be a little more convincing .
okay . that &apos;s not going to happen .
what are we talking about , like $ 100 million , $ 200 million ?
you know what we &apos;re talking about .
we have more than we &apos;re ever gonna be able to spend anyway .
we have more than we &apos;ll ever be--
no , that &apos;s not true .
but i don &apos;t know .
this is a massive undertaking .
nobody knows what it &apos;s gonna cost .
so what are you saying ?
are you saying that they take everything ?
i mean , everything from the lawsuit , from all of us ?
i have no idea what it &apos;s gonna cost to buy seattle grace ,
but i can guarantee you
it &apos;s more than the four of us have combined . i--
that &apos;s only $ 60 million .
i had some money before all this .
i &apos;ve got about ...
700 grand i can get to right away .
it &apos;s true . we have money in the i.r.a. and we have about--
no , let &apos;s not get ahead of ourselves .
well , just the lawsuit damages then .
and , uh , we &apos;ve got mark &apos;s share , too .
mark &apos;s share ?
yeah , and lexie &apos;s maybe ? is that rude of me--
i mean , i would have to ask her f--our--our father--
don &apos;t worry . excuse me . yes , this is rude of you .
okay , i &apos;m sorry , but we can &apos;t waste time on politeness here .
and mark &apos;s share is not our money . it &apos;s sofia &apos;s .
you should &apos;ve talked about this with me-- um ,
that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing .
i mean privately with your wife .
where is cristina ?
i don &apos;t know . i keep texting her .
she would say yes to this .
how do you know that ?
she knows .
leave us alone .
oh , get some sleep .
this isn &apos;t all on your shoulders .
it shouldn &apos;t be .
it is right now .
if i can &apos;t , you know , if i can &apos;t talk the nurses
into staying--
you will .
i just don &apos;t know what &apos;s gonna happen ,
with or without pegasus .
i keep running through the worst @-@ case scenarios and ...
all i know is ...
that i &apos;m happy here with you .
whatever &apos;s falling apart , i just ...
you and i , we &apos;re ...
we &apos;re safe .
right . right ?
exactly right .
i don &apos;t think that it &apos;s right to spend all of our money .
it is an investment .
of all of our money , callie .
if your parents had ever made you have a summer job ...
you might understand .
oh , come on . that is so unfair .
no , you are ready to bankrupt us .
you &apos;re ready to let pegasus horizons turn us into a bunch of robots .
you are ready to sink $ 50 million
into maintaining a good vibe .
so what &apos;s the alternative , we leave ?
no , i don &apos;t want to leave .
this hospital is not something that we lucked into .
this is something that we made .
and webber hired us , and he set a tone .
hunt sets a tone ,
and it &apos;s something i am proud to be a part of ,
and it &apos;s worth fighting for .
shoot . sorry . is that mine or yours ?
it &apos;s mine , but she &apos;s gonna wake yours .
i think callie &apos;s right .
this isn &apos;t about a financial investment .
it &apos;s a much bigger opportunity ...
right .
to stay and make the place we dreamed of work again .
yes .
oh , god . will you two stop it ?
we are not spending this money .
if i have learned anything in the past year ,
it &apos;s that we don &apos;t get to know what &apos;s coming around the corner .
anything can happen , to you , to me . anything .
and our daughter deserves
as much protection as we can give her .
and we have the chance to not have to worry
no matter what happens ,
a chance to be prepared should the worst happen--
i don &apos;t want to live like that ...
getting ready for disasters that may never happen .
well , we have an opportunity right now
to do something about it .
and maybe we have a responsibility to do that--
oh , don &apos;t try and make me feel selfish .
don &apos;t try and make me feel guilty
just because you do .
who said i felt guilty ?
i think--i think you felt guilty ,
but that &apos;s not--it &apos;s not-- .
no , no , no , no , no . let &apos;s--go ahead .
tell me .
some of us died .
and some of us are gonna live with challenges
for the rest of their life .
and you-- you got the money .
and then you got your hand back
and you got your career back ,
and i think that you feel guilty .
i think you feel guilty about your decision to sue
and i @-@ i think that you feel guilty
about having all this money .
and now i think that you want to be the one
that comes in and saves everyone ,
and you have to be the hero .
and it &apos;s selfish and it &apos;s egomaniacal ,
and now it &apos;s affecting my family .
so just stop . okay ?
everything that you &apos;ve done to make it better
has actually made it worse .
so please stop .
i think we should go .
you should .
艰苦的谈判
hey , derek . i owe you an apology .
oh , no . there &apos;s no need .
no , no , i do .
it was late , and i was tired and stressed out .
well , we were all stressed out .
we &apos;re just trying to do our best .
no , i know , but i had no right to call you egotistical .
it was &quot; egomaniacal , &quot; i think .
yeah . i was out of line .
on the other hand ...
you &apos;re pegasus &apos; &quot; face of the hospital &quot; ?
cahill said it would be some brochures ,
some schmoozing , not ...
all of this .
not a whole lot of practicing medicine either .
i hope you know what you &apos;re in for .
no offense , derek .
i mean , it &apos;s a great face , but ...
this is a lot of it .
i mean , this is kind of gross .
this is unacceptable .
dr. shepherd , hold up !
yeah ?
love the picture .
love it . your head is gigantic .
i &apos;m prepping for our a.v.m.
do you prefer o.r. two or four ?
he &apos;s doing an a.v.m. under hypothermic arrest
where he drops the brain &apos;s temperature
to avoid stroke risk .
i know what it is .
he &apos;s the only one in the region who does it .
i know .
i &apos;ve always wanted to see it up close .
can we go now ?
i &apos;m not doing it . cahill wants me to meet the buyers .
he &apos;s the new face of the hospital now .
and the hair . lucky us .
great . just make it go away .
oh , my god .
can we talk about the giant pictures of myself ?
do you love them ?
i want &apos; em down , all of them .
i agreed to a brochure .
&quot; and other marketing materials and collateral . &quot;
this is that .
what are you ashamed of ,
telling people that your hospital
is more than just a set of
clinically sterilized walls and equipment ,
that it is full of people who are intelligent
and passionate about caring for them ?
&apos;cause that is what your face tells people .
says who ?
well , three focus groups can &apos;t be wrong .
so just give it a few days .
you &apos;ll get used to you .
you ready for the nurses ?
marcia lowe to c.t.u ...
it means a lot to me , derek .
i know this is not you .
i know this is a sacrifice ,
but this sale is our last shot ,
and i feel like i &apos;ve been fighting this battle alone .
and to have you in the fight with me ...
that means a lot .
i don &apos;t , uh ...
i don &apos;t want to do this anymore .
oh . oh , i , um--
no , no , no , no . no , no , not--not this .
i want to do this .
lots of this .
i just don &apos;t want to do it ... here .
i want to take you out on a date .
someplace that doesn &apos;t have ...
wheels ...
yes , okay . that would-- that would be nice .
and where fewer people have bled to death .
oh , well , now i &apos;m totally sold .
tonight ?
tonight ?
okay .
great .
i can &apos;t wait to see you out of those clothes .
i meant ... scrubs .
uh , in regular ... clothes .
not that you don &apos;t look great in scrubs ,
&apos;cause you would look great in anything ...
like , uh , coveralls or--
or parka .
7 : 30 ?
7 : 30 .
oh , and if i &apos;m late ,
it &apos;s because i &apos;m still banging my head into a wall
over how this just went .
it went great .
could be a volvulus .
let &apos;s intubate and put in an n.g. tube .
draw 0.8 of etomidate .
when was the baby delivered ?
25 minutes ago . vomiting , distended abdomen .
i need those films back , stat .
give me the etomidate .
sedatives in a newborn need a light touch ,
so i like to do it myself .
it &apos;s okay , buddy . you go to sleep .
i promise you won &apos;t remember any of this crap .
what are you smiling about ?
nothing .
cut it out .
we need to tell his parents
their brand @-@ new baby needs surgery .
his bowels have twisted around the blood supply ,
causing an obstruction .
so ...
we need to do
an emergency surgery to correct that immediately .
so ... we are going to ...
do that .
mr. finch , uh , can i , uh ,
speak with you outside for a sec ?
i know this is a lot to take .
um , are you and your wife okay ?
who , langer ?
i don &apos;t know . i don &apos;t know her that well .
that &apos;s my kid , but she-- but she &apos;s not my wife .
we work together .
we hooked up one time .
we tore one off at an office party ...
and his condom breaks
because he &apos;s too cheap and stupid
to buy decent ones .
i &apos;m almost 40 , i want a baby , so i told him ,
&quot; you &apos;re off the hook , but i &apos;m keeping it . &quot;
and he says that he wants to do the right thing .
i &apos;m gonna raise that baby .
i mean , financially , yeah , but i &apos;m gonna be there .
i want to , you know ... be a father to that kid .
he &apos;s a complete asshat , but he makes a good living .
she &apos;s a bitch on wheels ,
but she &apos;s smart and she &apos;s tough .
a kid could do worse .
and right now all i care about is my baby .
is my baby gonna be okay ?
tell me my kid &apos;s gonna be okay .
can you do that ?
so the chemo didn &apos;t work ?
just like the radiation .
a.j. &apos; s cancer has continued to spread .
so what , surgery now ?
i mean , you said that surgery could kill him .
you said he was too weak .
well , dr. bailey here is suggesting another approach .
yeah , it &apos;s called genome mapping .
if we can identify the specific d.n.a. sequence
of a.j. &apos; s tumor ,
it could open up a variety of treatment options
and targeted drug therapies .
a @-@ and no surgery ?
you can do that here ?
uh , no , not--not yet .
we would have to contract out to another facility .
i &apos;m just waiting for approval
from the hospital advisory board ,
and i think we &apos;ll have that today .
we would just need to have your consent
to try--
we will take this as a &quot; yes . &quot;
okay .
okay , i have salary and bonus breakdowns ,
benefits packages , pension stuff--
don &apos;t be nervous .
i &apos;m not . i can talk to my people .
well , i hope so ,
&apos;cause if not , we &apos;re in trouble .
you trying to make me nervous ?
hey , uh , dr. hunt ?
uh , bailey , i have to--
no , i @-@ i just wondered
what you heard back from the advisory board .
uh , about ?
about m @-@ my genome mapping .
the request i submitted to sequence--
right , right . sorry . um , they turned it down .
well , no , no , no . it &apos;s-- it &apos;s just one sequence ...
it &apos;s a &quot; no . &quot;
for ...
sorry .
okay , so what is the big secret plan ?
we want to pool our winnings from the lawsuit
and buy the hospital .
i was hoping you &apos;d be on board .
maybe i misspoke .
so that is the plan ?
yes .
that is so stupid !
you don &apos;t know the first thing about owning a hospital
or running one , and neither do i.
well , pegasus horizons knows how not to run a hospital .
i mean , you should hear callie &apos;s stories .
it &apos;s this or go somewhere else .
no . n @-@ no one leaves .
owen says if people start leaving ,
the sale won &apos;t go through , and we &apos;re screwed .
that &apos;s why we want to buy it ,
because we &apos;re doctors , and we know how it runs .
did you know you &apos;ll have to file a declaration
for land use for approval by the state attorney general ?
will we ?
i don &apos;t know . i just made that up .
but see ? we don &apos;t know anything about this .
i &apos;m surprised . i thought you &apos;d be on board .
or you &apos;d leave again .
hey , no one leaves .
owen is killing himself trying to keep the hospital open .
can we please stop talking nonsense
and have his back ?
hey . our , uh , panniculectomy was discharged .
said to say thanks .
liposuction day ?
high @-@ volume , high @-@ price @-@ tag ,
&apos;cause when pegasus trims the fat , so do i.
what &apos;s the matter ?
nope . can &apos;t talk about it .
why , &apos; cause of her ?
mrs. berkus .
mrs. berkus .
mrs. berkus !
she &apos;s blotto . what &apos;s up ?
no , i can &apos;t talk about it to you .
i could when we were friends , but now ...
oh , we seriously can &apos;t be friends now ?
yes , we can .
just ...
this is too much .
how about this ?
i will tell you a thing
i would tell you when we were friends .
my mom ... she is driving me nuts
about taking a bigger role in the harper avery foundation .
&quot; grow up , child . get your legacy on . &quot;
it &apos;s not bad advice .
i know that , but i &apos;m working my ass off here ,
and i &apos;m not even an attending yet .
you know what ? you &apos;re a crappy friend .
you &apos;re supposed to side with me .
i d ...
see ? now you go .
so i &apos;ve been seeing this paramedic .
i &apos;m aware .
too much ?
no . i told you
i was seeing stephanie the intern .
was that too much ?
no . i mean , it &apos;s not a thing .
it &apos;s just , you know , fun and ...
we &apos;re not serious .
we both know how that can turn out .
that is true .
okay , your turn .
uh , okay .
so ...
he asked me out ... on a date ,
like our first real date .
and it &apos;s really , like , our fifth date .
and ... and this real date
is probably gonna wind up at someone &apos;s apartment .
and it &apos;s ... going in a direction , you know ?
and it &apos;s one thing to tell a guy
that you &apos;re a virgin and hope he understands ,
but to tell him that i was a virgin and then wasn &apos;t
and now am again ...
i just feel like there &apos;s no way he &apos;s gonna understand that .
i mean , who understands that ?
but i really like him and i just ...
it &apos;s all gonna end tonight .
oh , god . too much .
nope .
oh , way too much , april .
look , tell him exactly what you told me ,
and he won &apos;t care whether you &apos;re a virgin or not .
he won &apos;t ?
he &apos;ll be worried you &apos;re mentally ill ,
because you sound like a nut job .
good to have you back , pal .
hey , i &apos;m kidding .
no , i know . see ya .
come on , april .
i guide the parachute into the heart ,
open it ...
so it will block off the damage caused by his heart attack .
it should keep the rest of his heart
from working so hard while it heals .
that is crazy balls .
i &apos;m in position now .
what did your friend at u.c. davis say ?
are the other interns still dropping like flies ?
yeah .
there &apos;s at least four openings .
what are you talking about ?
mousy , speak .
some of us are talking about ...
looking elsewhere .
why ?
last year , seattle grace
was the residency match you dreamed of getting .
the last few weeks ,
it feels like automotive trade school .
god .
where is your sense of loyalty ?
there are people here
fighting to make sure this hospital stays open at all .
and at the first sign of trouble ,
you show them your ass ?
no . no , it &apos;s just that ...
i &apos;m sorry .
i only have five years
to get as good at this as i possibly can .
and i want to be excellent .
i want to be the best ,
so i can &apos;t waste another minute .
i mean , would you have when you were an intern ?
honestly ?
there &apos;s the volvulus .
all right . retract there .
i &apos;ll dissect .
do you think they can work ,
workplace relationships ?
what ? what do you mean ?
look at these two ...
coworkers who wanted a quickie
and got a baby .
well , they both seem to want the baby .
yeah , but they don &apos;t want each other .
and now they &apos;re stuck seeing each other
at the kid &apos;s recitals and at staff meetings ?
it &apos;s a disaster , right ?
ah , i don &apos;t know . everybody &apos;s different .
true .
you &apos;ve had relationships with coworkers .
yeah .
and look how those played out .
you &apos;re single and alone .
when i met you , you had a mattress and one bowl .
come on . that &apos;s ...
yeah , well ...
it &apos;s just ... more trouble than it &apos;s worth , right ?
what happened ?
hematoma on the liver . it burst .
2 @-@ 0 chromic .
crap . it &apos;s tearing .
pack him . pack him gently .
i need , uh , thrombin and fibrin glue .
get some factor vii in here now .
right away , doctor .
i got your page .
i thought you weren &apos;t doing the a.v.m ..
oh , we &apos;re not .
pegasus wants to do some photos of me in surgery .
it &apos;s not real . you know , it &apos;s just pretend .
but we need some more bodies .
i thought you &apos;d like to come in there .
uh ... with all due respect , sir , may i not ?
what ?
dr. yang &apos;s testing a new protocol .
i &apos;d learn more from watching that
than pretending to do surgery .
i mean , if you really need me to--
no .
it &apos;s okay . go .
thank you .
this is ridiculous .
i have had the same schedule for six years .
and now we &apos;re splitting shifts ?
my husband works two jobs . who picks up my kid now ?
pegasus breaks up shifts differently .
i don &apos;t need this .
and we get shafted . i &apos;m not taking this .
who &apos;s taking this ?
if you know how to talk to your people ,
you should start now .
i am . they keep coming back .
cahill , chief .
look , i &apos;m sorry , but this is not gonna work .
no , shepherd . i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;ve been waiting for 20 minutes .
chief , i just wanted to ask you again
about the genetic screening .
bailey , i &apos;m sorry .
all right , look , i am trying to work with you .
but it cannot be now . but i &apos;m not gonna reschedule my surgeries
so i can do a photo op .
when this hospital is on a firmer financial footing--
no , this isn &apos;t about me looking for extra credit .
it &apos;s just a couple of shots of you in action .
this is about a specific
no , you have enough pictures of me .
bailey
if you just read the chart ,
then you can talk to the stupid board ...
bailey ...
and make them understand
bailey , they didn &apos;t say no . i did .
i didn &apos;t bring it up to them
because it will not be approved .
so we &apos;re just gonna--
the answer &apos;s no , bailey .
yes , sir .
never mind then .
what is it , shepherd ?
nothing . i &apos;m good .
it &apos;s derek shepherd .
i have an idea , a crazy idea ,
and i need you to tell me how crazy .
this isn &apos;t weird .
i know . i wanted to meet outside the hospital .
and then with the rain--
no , i like it . it &apos;s very cloak @-@ and @-@ daggery .
you must be dr.torres.
oh , god !
callie torres , stan grossberg .
he &apos;s my financial advisor .
i think i might have died for a second .
i asked him about the feasibility of our idea .
stan , tell her what you told me .
under federal law ,
physicians cannot own and run the hospital
for which they work .
so we &apos;re hosed .
however , you could ally yourselves with a for @-@ profit
or not @-@ for @-@ profit agency ,
which would be owner pro forma .
then the five of you could form your own management company ,
which would be hired by this foundation .
so we &apos;re not hosed .
basically , you would run the day @-@ to @-@ day operations ,
much like a board of directors .
and again i ask , who wants to do that ?
just let him finish .
i &apos;m sorry , but i &apos;d rather be in an operating room than a boardroom .
besides , i thought we didn &apos;t have enough money to do this anyway .
well , i &apos;m working on that .
estimating the number of beds ,
the , uh , overall operating budget ,
the property and business taxes ,
the franchise tax board payments ...
okay , right , right , right .
i &apos;m asking , is it possible for us to do ?
that &apos;s what he &apos;s saying . it is possible .
it is very possible .
okay , well , how much more money would we need ?
that &apos;s what i was saying , i @-@ i don &apos;t know .
not until i see a hospital financial statement .
how do we get that ?
owen can get that for us .
if we have a hope of outbidding pegasus ,
the element of surprise is sort of crucial here .
owen can &apos;t know any of this .
we &apos;re gonna go behind owen &apos;s back to steal the hospital ?
no , owen will still be chief .
he &apos;s legally obligated to tell them of anything
that might interfere with the sale .
he signed noncompetes , nondisclosures .
if he breaches them , they will fire him .
they will sue him .
there could even be jail time .
he can &apos;t know any this .
you want me to lie to him .
no , i want you to just not say anything for now .
you want me to lie to him .
the nurses aren &apos;t being unreasonable .
they have valid concerns .
and i &apos;m worried
that you don &apos;t know how to address those concerns .
yeah , well , i &apos;m worried you &apos;re asking me
to sell them something that i don &apos;t even believe in .
you &apos;re a doctor .
you know sometimes you have to swallow some bitter pills
in order to get well .
this is a bad pill .
yeah , well , why don &apos;t you tell &apos; em that ?
they need to hear it from someone they trust .
do you remember last week when we operated , the logger ?
before that , i didn &apos;t think that i ever would
or could step up to an o.r. table again .
i was scared the whole time ,
as scared as i have ever been in my life .
i had no idea .
i know .
the only reason i was able to do it ...
was because you were there ,
and i barely even knew you .
but you were so calm and sure .
and if you were okay , i would be okay ,
not many people have this quality .
what happened ? can i ask ?
it &apos;s not a good story .
sorry . it &apos;s none of my business .
no , i mean , it &apos;s-- it &apos;s not an interesting story .
you &apos;ve heard it a hundred times .
i choked is all .
i am good at this job .
so you can believe me when i tell you
that only you can help these people understand
that something that hurts them in the short run
will help them in the long run .
when you tell someone that everything will be okay ,
they &apos;ll trust you .
you know you hold this place together ,
every doctor and every patient here knows that .
i know that you are the cornerstones .
i need you to be strong right now in this transition .
transitions are scary , i know .
but believe me , i ...
i would not be asking you to go through this
if i did not believe that what pegasus horizons offers
is the best thing for all of us .
i mean , if i didn &apos;t , i would leave with you .
i &apos;m asking you to stay .
trust me ,
work with me .
help me get us through this .
can we do that ?
we can try .
right ?
i &apos;ll try .
give it a go .
i can try to repair the liver ,
but it &apos;s incredibly delicate ,
and there &apos;s a high risk that it will be permanently damaged .
and the baby dies .
it &apos;s a risk .
the other option is , we sit tight
and hope the bleeding stops on its own .
and hope he survives that .
what ?
what , what ?
say something .
decide .
well , i say we wait . don &apos;t do anything .
right .
no , that &apos;s stupid .
do the surgery . no , i don &apos;t know .
i don &apos;t know . i can &apos;t ...
i can &apos;t decide .
i can &apos;t . i can &apos;t do this .
you do it . i can &apos;t .
we both decide .
okay ? i &apos;m scared , too .
i &apos;m--i &apos;m as scared as you are .
but you are the biggest , meanest , ballbusting ,
ice @-@ queen , nightmare bitch that i have ever met .
so if i can do this , you can .
let &apos;s ...
wait .
can i have a glass of water , please ?
and a maxi pad for my girlfriend here .
nice .
look at that .
it &apos;s bad enough that they &apos;re up there at all ,
and now i have to deal with this ?
we &apos;ll put a stop to it .
i &apos;ll have this one taken down .
i want them all taken down .
i didn &apos;t do it .
do you believe it ?
what do you mean ?
what you said to the nurses--
&quot; pegasus will lead us to a brighter tomorrow . &quot;
do you really believe that ?
it is the only option that we--
hey , it &apos;s just us now .
it &apos;s me .
no .
no , okay ? no . no , i don &apos;t .
it &apos;s a bitter pill , and we just have to swallow it .
and honestly , i don &apos;t even know
if this is gonna make us better or worse .
then why are you fighting so hard for something--
there &apos;s no other choice .
this is our only shot .
okay , but what-- what if it wasn &apos;t , though ?
what if it &apos;s not all on you to fix everything--
but it is . it is all on me .
no , owen , owen , listen--
i put you all on that plane .
i &apos;m sorry . it &apos;s ... cahill .
what ?
today ?
no , no , no , no , no . no , that is--
that &apos;s ... amazing .
um , i &apos;ll come find you .
what ?
it &apos;s almost over .
this is so stupid .
this is the only way i can think of getting in there .
so we &apos;re in a heist movie now ?
stan needs to see the financial statements .
i will schmooze , distract , and then you--
what , stick one down my shirt ?
i don &apos;t know .
all right , just ... let &apos;s go . get me in there .
gentlemen and ladies , i &apos;m sorry to interrupt you ,
but i &apos;d like to introduce you to my wife , dr. meredith grey .
what a pleasure it is to meet you , sir .
nice to meet you .
oh ! oh , my goodness . oh , oh .
i &apos;m so sorry .
meredith .
oh , no . i @-@ i am a little clumsy . i am so sorry .
they are not approving the genome mapping at this time .
but you said that--
we were sure that it was gonna go the other way .
so i &apos;m sorry .
so now we &apos;re back to a colectomy .
i want to wait another day to see if a.j. improves ,
but ... it needs to be soon .
i @-@ is that our only option ?
yeah , i &apos;m afraid that that &apos;s--
no . there &apos;s one other option .
you can go
someplace that will find an approach that works for him ,
someplace that will give him the care that he deserves .
he won &apos;t get that here .
i say leave .
leave seattle grace and go someplace else , fast .
what the hell was that ?
that was the only medical advice i could give them in good conscience .
i &apos;m thinking i need to take it myself .
hey , whoa . what are you talking about ?
i tried .
i tried to put on the smile and knuckle down
and make it work , but maybe i can get a job in l.a. ,
be where my husband is ,
and tuck ...
tuck &apos;s dad &apos;s never gonna let me move him out of the city--
no , no , maybe i can talk to him , right ?
maybe we can work something out .
stop it . stop it . you and tuck aren &apos;t going anywhere .
i don &apos;t want to work here anymore .
it makes me ... feel small .
i have to make myself smaller to work here .
i @-@ i feel like if i do that ,
i feel like i won &apos;t want to look my son in the eye .
i don &apos;t recognize this place anymore
or the people .
i d--i don &apos;t want to hang around long enough
that i don &apos;t recognize myself .
i &apos;ve had some sucky jobs here ,
but doing nothing sucks the worst .
if his sats stay above 3 for one more minute ,
he &apos;s out of the woods .
i think it could work .
what can ?
you know , people , coworkers getting together .
i mean , don &apos;t judge it from those lawyers .
they don &apos;t even like each other .
look at grey and shepherd .
i mean , they tried to avoid it ,
but it was like fate or whatever .
they had to be together .
it was just right , you know ?
that &apos;s ... beautiful .
you should write poetry or greeting cards .
i &apos;m just saying it could work . ten seconds .
you have a blog that i could follow ?
shut up .
you ever write poems about horses ,
just pretty , pretty horses ?
shut up . five ...
four , three , two ...
one .
yes . yes .
oh , shut up .
i &apos;m sorry ?
no , not you . sorry .
april .
tell him who you are .
if he doesn &apos;t get it , then you don &apos;t need him anyway .
but i really like him ,
and ... i think if i tell him , it &apos;s all gonna be over .
so wait ... a little while .
let him get to know you better .
once he does , he &apos;s gonna want to follow you anywhere .
trust me .
thank you .
i could marry you again right now .
you &apos;re so hot when you &apos;re nefarious . hold on .
arizona wants to meet with all of us .

if this can happen , we need to make this happen , fast .
wait , wait . are you in ?
i &apos;m in .
so what &apos;s the next step ?
well , we don &apos;t have enough money .
we &apos;re gonna have to find the rest somewhere else .
can we do that in three days ?
two now . what about cristina , is she in ?
i don &apos;t know now .
well , ask her .
it &apos;s happening , tonight .
pegasus wants to move up the closing .
they want to buy the hospital tonight .
what ?
how do you know ?
owen told me .
well , did you say anything to him ?
no , i didn &apos;t say anything ,
but we have to do it , for owen .
we have to do this now .
b @-@ before tonight ? we can &apos;t .
no , there &apos;s not enough time .
we have to stop them .
how ? there &apos;s nothing that we can do .
there &apos;s one thing we can do .
hey !
stop right there .
we &apos;re thrilled .
very excited .
shall we start ?
first is the letter of intent .
sign here .
initial here .
oh , dr. shepherd . come in . we were just--
sorry to interrupt . i &apos;d like to talk to dr. hunt for a second .
um , what &apos;s up ?
guys ?
i &apos;d like to tender my resignation ,
effective immediately .
me , too . i quit .
i quit , too .
me , too .
i quit , too .
he thinks we stabbed him in the back .
well , all we did was buy some time
to slow down the sale ,
so we can come up with the money .
i know . i know .
all right , stan says he can meet with us now .
okay , i &apos;ll go get my stuff .
yeah , we get all our stuff &apos; cause we just quit .
what about our patients ?
we &apos;ll get &apos; em covered by someone .
dr. shepherd ,
this young man has something to say to you .
did you get them all ?
pretty much .
good work , ross . go home .
something &apos;s going on here .
what &apos;s going on ?
you &apos;ll know soon .
did you see the look on his face ?
oh , richard will be fine .
no , owen .
this is wrong .
i &apos;m gonna go talk to him . i have to explain .
no . cristina , no .
it &apos;s the right thing to do , for his sake .
when the time is right , we &apos;ll tell him ,
and he &apos;ll understand .
i don &apos;t know if he will .
wait .
nothing . never mind . sorry .
okay , we should , um ...
we should , though ,
uh , stop .
okay , there &apos;s something i have to tell you .
i don &apos;t want to ,
&apos;cause i think it might be the last i see of you .
this is only gonna go so far tonight .
god .
&apos;cause i am , uh ...
saving myself for marriage .
oh , god .
oh , dear god .
yeah , uh , i know .
it &apos;s weird .
and it &apos;s not something you hear every day ,
but it is something that i believe in .
and i can completely understand
if you can &apos;t hang with that .
no . no , i can .
i can hang . i do .
i , i am , too .
are you messing with me right now ?
no . no .
i am , too .
only there &apos;s , um ...
there &apos;s just this one thing .
what ?
nothing .
i am , too .
what the hell was that ?
did you know that they were gonna pull that ?
there &apos;s a way to salvage this .
salvage what ?
they withdrew the offer .
losing those surgeons , losing shepherd ,
completely changes the value of the hospital .
you &apos;d better do something
and fast .
there &apos;s--there &apos;s no way
that we can replace them .
there &apos;s , um ...
i can &apos;t reposition .
i can &apos;t find new buyers .
by tomorrow morning , the whole industry will know .
i can &apos;t . i can &apos;t .
you have to .
you say this is what you &apos;re good at .
it better be , because everyone that i thought was in my corner
just walked out ,
and you are all that i have now .
so either go and get pegasus back ,
or find another buyer .
you say you trust me .
then trust me when i say
you can do this ,
because you have to .
they say that negotiation is an art form .
yet , when we negotiate ...
his b.p. looks good . his labs look great .
we &apos;ll watch him closely overnight ,
but i think he &apos;s gonna be just fine .
thank you .
we have a strategy , we use tactics .
all right , can you please move your fat head
so i can get a look ?
tool .
that &apos;s gonna be fun .
i &apos;m especially excited for that kid &apos;s next 18 years .
hey , you want to go get a beer ?
oh , i would love to , especially after today ,
but , actually
already have plans .
tomorrow night ? is that cool ?
yeah , that &apos;s cool .
okay .
hey . who is that guy ?
that is ...
chest peckwell .
what ?
it &apos;s not his real name .
we just called him that before we knew it .
o.b. resident .
jo &apos;s been mooning over the guy since he got here ,
and she finally grew herself a pair and asked him out .
yay , jo .
she didn &apos;t tell you about him ?
yeah , she did .
&quot; strategies &quot; and &quot; tactics &quot;
aren &apos;t words we use for seeking a compromise .
cristina !
cristina !
cristina !
those are words for going to war .
the first thing you &apos;ll need to do is to form an l.l.c.
so that you can legally get all your funds in one place .
and you &apos;ll need a name for your new corporation .
what did we just do ?
do you know what you &apos;d like to call yourselves ?
how about &quot; the bitter pills &quot; ?
&quot; epic failure &quot; ?
&quot; death spiral &quot; ?
&quot; blind leading the blind , incorporated &quot; ?
