wait minute . i want to confirm this before we can report it .
okay , wbbm can now project that
peter florrick is the next state &apos;s attorney of cook county .
it &apos;s always best to know the truth ,
no matter how much it hurts .
do you believe that ?
yes .
it was a rumor your husband
slept with one of his coworkers two years ago .
there was no one in the department with that name .
leela .
but she doesn &apos;t exit .
unless you &apos;ve heard of her .
have you heard of her ? leela ?
let me introduce you to cook county &apos;s
new state &apos;s attorney , peter florrick !
thanks for coming out so late .
no problem .
don &apos;t worry .
real estate is a 24 @-@ hour a day job .
congratulations , mrs. state &apos;s attorney .
thank you .
so this is available now ?
it is . two bedrooms , two bath .
furnished . $ 2,800 a month .
but to be honest , if you gave me some time
i could probably get that down .
no .
that &apos;s fine . thank you .
it has a view .
most importantly ,
it &apos;s right around the corner from the courthouse .
do you have the lease ?
wow . when you decide , you really decide .
ten minutes ago , i received
a very gracious concession call from wendy scott @-@ carr .
that was peter florrick speaking
to his supporters a few minutes ago .
and now i &apos;ve got his mother , mrs. jackie florrick .
well , you must be a very proud mother tonight .
oh , rob , you can &apos;t ...
hey , babe , where are you ?
i found a place .
what ? !
like a house ?
an apartment .
come look .
what ... ? you there now ?
yes . the kids are staying with jackie tonight .
okay . well , look , can you give me about an hour ?
things are starting to wind down here .
sure .
1601 north state , apartment 908 .
okay , see you there .
我们非常遗憾地通知您 ...
you are so funny .
you got it already ?
is it big enough ?
this is your apartment , peter .
i &apos;ve moved all your things here .
what ?
you &apos;ll have to use your cell phone for a while
until they can get the phones connected ,
and i &apos;ve paid your first three months rent .
i don &apos;t get this .
you slept with kalinda .
look ...
no , don &apos;t ...
peter .
this makes it easier .
so please just take your keys .
alicia , i need you .
you slept with my best friend .
it was before she was your best friend .
oh , god .
look , i &apos;m not trying to make excuses ,
but you know i &apos;ve changed .
i love you .
look , what can i do to make this better .
nothing .
* i thought i was a victim *
* that people hated me *
* i never had a homeland *
* i had no safety huh , yah *
* let it go , let it go *
* turn on the light , y &apos;all *
* i love the beast , y &apos;all *
* let it go , let it go *
* turn on the light , y &apos;all *
* then take your pills *
* i love the beast , y &apos;all *
excuse me , your honor , do i really have to say ?
you do if you want me to rule , miss nyholm .
lockhart &amp; gardner has gotten in the nasty little habit
of pushing legal agenda through emergency injunction .
you can &apos;t decide something that hasn &apos;t happened , your honor .
and , as my opposing counsel well knows ,
there is no liver available yet , so there is nothing to enjoin ...
yes , but as miss nyholm well knows ,
when the donor &apos;s liver does become available ...
i &apos;m sorry , i wasn &apos;t finished yet .
... there will only be a 12 @-@ hour window of viability
and that is what miss nyholm is counting on .
you have no idea what i &apos;m counting on .
she is counting on that liver
being transplanted into another patient .
and at that point , there truly will be nothing to enjoin .
okay . can i have my turn now ?
yes , your honor .
i wish mrs. florrick didn &apos;t think
she was arguing before the supreme court .
and i wish miss nyholm did .
miss nyholm , this 12 @-@ hour window of viability
offers insufficient time for an emergency injunction ,
so your objection is overruled .
continue .
so , marjorie ,
when did your liver start to fail ?
two years ago .
and what happened a week ago ?
there was a match for my liver .
a young man had been in a motorcycle accident
and was brain dead .
my name was at the top of the orsn list .
i know i sound like an expert on this stuff ,
but you get informed really fast when you &apos;re this sick .
so you were told
that this donor &apos;s liver was intended for you ?
yes .
you can &apos;t believe how happy we were .
my s ... son ... oh ...
i &apos;m sorry .
he &apos;s five .
i haven &apos;t told him that there &apos;s a ... a problem yet .
what is that problem ?
i don &apos;t know .
all i know is , my name was removed
from the orsn list .
and what has the doctor told you will happen next ?
well ... without this liver ,
they say i have ...
three weeks .
we need to know how long the donor has .
got it .
how &apos;s alicia doing ?
she &apos;s got patti on her heels .
the motorcycle accident severed his brain stem .
is he in pain ?
no , he &apos;s not .
it &apos;s just that there are people at this hospital
who could benefit ... from this terrible tragedy .
we know , doctor ?
but we need to wait .
i &apos;m so sorry .
my other son-- we &apos;re sending for him .
that &apos;s okay .
you know , if you need anything ...
thank you . mm @-@ hmm .
hey , guys , all that stuff &apos;s coming in here .
what &apos;s going on over there ?
i don &apos;t know .
we &apos;re making space .
they won &apos;t allow their son to be unplugged
until his brother comes from afghanistan to see him .
i know i sound like a ghoul even asking this , but how long ?
they &apos;re putting him on a transport tomorrow .
they think three days .
objection !
asked and answered .
sustained .
well , let me see if i ask this to mrs. florrick &apos;s satisfaction .
what did your specialist , dr. lawton ,
tell you exactly was the reason
why you were removed from the liver contention ?
he said my liver failure was so far advanced
that a new liver would only be counterproductive .
and you might only live another six months with the liver ?
yes , but he wasn &apos;t sure .
i understand that .
and i &apos;m sorry to ask you this , marjorie .
there are only so many viable livers available for transplant .
wouldn &apos;t it be better to see it transplanted into someone
who has a better chance of survival ?
i spent some time in a hospital over the last two years ,
and i know doctors speak of
objective and subjective medical criteria .
dr. lawton &apos;s opinion was subjective medical criteria .
no further questions , your honor .
we ask that we take a recess for the afternoon .
objection . again , your honor , delaying tactics .
one of mrs. florrick &apos;s key witnesses ,
mr. haynes from hospital administration ,
has been called away on an emergency .
he &apos;s not available .
your honor , this is a shell game .
we &apos;ll break for lunch .
miss nyholm , you have two hours
to produce this witness or show cause .
thank you .
it &apos;s my job .
no . you &apos;re not like before .
you &apos;re fighting for me .
change of plan . i want you
to take the questioning of the hospital administrator .
i think you &apos;re getting under patti &apos;s skin , so keep it up .
hello .
phone your boyfriend .
tell him i need to ask him something .
my boyfriend ?
will gardner . tell him i want to see him
in 30 minutes or i &apos;m on to the next .
what ?
it &apos;s good to see you .
and you .
you &apos;ve been working out .
how &apos;s the kid ?
good , thanks .
i &apos;ve been fired .
you &apos;ve been fired ?
by whom ?
my firm . my law firm .
the law firm i spilled blood for .
they fired me just this afternoon .
a senior partner informed me .
and are you looking for a new job ?
i &apos;m looking to sue .
$ 8.6 million .
they fired me because i &apos;m pregnant .
really ?
you &apos;re pregnant ?
i am . it happens .
are you thinking of populating a small island ?
you have five minutes ,
then i go to quinn &amp; holland .
i think they &apos;re still in the building .
so you go from fighting with us in the morning
to hiring us in the afternoon ?
yes .
why do you find that so confusing , mrs. florrick ?
will doesn &apos;t find that confusing , do you ?
you &apos;re using our suit , our donor suit
to get your firm to pay up ?
that is so adorably calculated .
maybe i just think you &apos;re good lawyers .
you have four minutes .
how did it go today ?
judge parks likes us .
we have three days until the liver &apos;s available .
yes , but you don &apos;t know what my firm has coming down the pike .
which you can &apos;t tell us or you will get disbarred .
true , but i &apos;m human ...
and pregnant .
and who knows what a pregnant woman in my state might say .
give me a taste .
we know you &apos;re using this
donor suit as a stalking horse
for a multimillion dollar malpractice
class action against harbor hospital .
the hospital administrator-- he &apos;s not out on an emergency .
you wanted to question him , didn &apos;t you , mrs. florrick ?
you have three minutes .
do you want my case or not ?
they didn &apos;t really fire you because you were pregnant .
of course they did .
but it makes a good story anyway .
then let &apos;s sue .
hello , alicia .
hello , jackie .
may i sit ?
you may .
but in 15 minutes i have to be in court .
why did you do it ?
you &apos;re in my office , jackie .
you &apos;ve come here for a specific reason .
i won &apos;t be put in a position of guessing .
you broke up with my son .
i dropped your children off ,
and found peter not there .
he was in an apartment you moved him into .
yes .
so you waited until he was elected ,
then you made your move .
what move do you imagine that might be , jackie ?
i have no idea .
i am not in your head .
your children were looking for their father .
my children are in school ,
and i intend to see them afterwards
and explain this to them .
and poison them with your bias ?
be cordial here , jackie , or i will ask you to leave .
you and i have had our differences , alicia ,
but i &apos;ve come to respect you ,
and @-@ and admire aspects of you .
but my son is hurting ,
and i ... i cannot see him ... hurt
on the day he should be happiest ,
i have never seen him so destroyed .
this is a private matter , jackie .
it is not for you to get involved .
i &apos;ve watched zach and grace for two years now .
and i thank you ,
but i don &apos;t need your help anymore .
excuse me ?
my children are grown .
they don &apos;t need your help . but thank you .
and i &apos;m glad you got time to spend together .
how can you talk this way ?
because i am this way .
your son has made me this way .
my son loves you .
you will see your grandchildren , jackie .
don &apos;t worry , i will make that happen .
and again i thank you .
you were a lifesaver when i needed a lifesaver ,
but that &apos;s over now .
and i have to get to court .
damn you to hell .
your honor , this is not about one liver .
this is about their class action .
mr. roda , stop . i don &apos;t care .
i still have to adjudicate the case in front of me .
ms. lockhart .
it is our understanding the hospital administrator ,
mr. haynes , was not called away on an emergency call .
instead , he is staying at his vacation home in michigan .
we ask that your honor compel his presence in court
or censure opposing counsel for their deception .
mr. roda ?
i ... your honor , we have no knowledge of this alleged location .
well , then , let me get you their phone and address .
your honor ,
we ask that you disqualify lockhart / gardner
as counsel for the plaintiff .
it &apos;s come to our attention that our retired first chair ,
miss nyholm , has hired diane lockhart
as a counsel in a suit against us .
really ?
well , what happened there ?
our firm found it necessary to relieve miss nyholm of her position ,
and she has since hired their firm
to sue us for damages .
miss nyholm , is this true ?
oh , yeah . it &apos;s really quite dramatic .
i &apos;m sure you can understand , your honor ,
miss nyholm knows our stratagems
and all the specifics of our defense .
mr. roda ,
i can &apos;t tell miss nyholm which firm she can hire .
yes , but you can insist on a strict division
between miss nyholm &apos;s case and this one .
that &apos;s correct .
miss nyholm , do you understand that there
must be a strict division between these two cases ?
i do .
your honor , miss nyholm just grinned
and winked at us when you said that .
i did not . i don &apos;t wink .
miss nyholm , without grinning ,
do you promise to keep these two cases separate ?
i do , your honor .
this is so unprofessional .
please talk to my lawyer .
mr. andrews , hello . i &apos;m will gardner ,
miss nyholm &apos;s attorney . it &apos;s nice to meet you .
do you have a moment ?
if patti looks at her partnership agreement ,
she &apos;ll see grievances must proceed through
automatic arbitration first .
yes , and we &apos;re ready ;
we have an arbiter on call .
well , unfortunately , my schedule won &apos;t clear up for a few weeks .
well , unfortunately , that &apos;s not gonna work for us .
we need you to meet now .
really ? or ... ?
or patti and i are gonna have a very long conversation
about class action suits .
and you know how we pregnant women like to talk .
i will not negotiate with a gun to my head .
so don &apos;t . just negotiate .
not if you were the last man standing , buddy .
welcome to arbitration .
i am retired judge loni goslin .
this is an automatic process intended to encourage
the free exchange of grievances ,
and a presentation of witnesses and exhibits .
and where is your plaintiff today , mr. gardner ?
she should be here any minute .
my apologies , your honor .
i really must insist on punctuality .
um , your honor , i would remind you
of the liquidated damages provision
in miss nyholm &apos;s contract specifying
a $ 50,000 payout in such circumstances .
that is far beyond the $ 8.6 million she is demanding .
yes , but the provision doesn &apos;t cover punitive .
you fired her because she was pregnant .
that is such complete and utter hogwash .
we fired her because she was alienating clients .
we were losing people .
as you can see from these grievance reports ,
miss nyholm has extreme mood swings ,
moments of temper flashes .
as you can see from this america pregnancy association report ,
those are potential side effects of a pregnancy .
oh , come on . you yourself complained
how she uses her pregnancy .
i am so sorry i &apos;m late .
i was changing diapers . what a mess .
oh , my goodness ,
look at you with your little hat !
isn &apos;t it sweet ? i knitted it myself .
and what a big girl , you are , aren &apos;t you ?
i &apos;m so sorry , i thought i &apos;d have day care today .
no , that &apos;s okay . isn &apos;t it okay ?
i don &apos;t know how you do it , zoe .
it must be hard working here .
sometimes .
yeah , i usually look on the bright side of things .
and sometimes there isn &apos;t a bright side ,
so ...
i have to go home ,
take a shower and wash it off .
oh , i asked about the commotion earlier .
um , we &apos;re having someone in for an operation .
i guess he &apos;s pretty big ,
so we had to clear some space .
kevin haynes .
i am harbor hospital &apos;s associate administrator .
thank you , mr. haynes .
and how was your emergency ?
objection .
sustained . ms. lockhart .
my apologies , your honor .
mr. haynes , tell me who jeffrey berkoff is .
who jeffrey berkoff is ?
an internet ceo .
yes , and multimillionaire .
how much has he donated to your hospital ?
objection , your honor .
i &apos;m not sure what this has to do with this case .
i &apos;m not sure either , so why don &apos;t we find out together ?
was my client , marjorie garnett , removed from the donors list
so that mr. berkoff could receive a liver ?
no , not at all .
but mr. berkoff is being flown in to receive
this liver right now , isn &apos;t he ?
room in the donors &apos; suite is being made for him ?
yes , but that has nothing to do with miss garnett &apos;s case .
the allocation of organs is an objective matter
governed by the orsn computers .
the only relevant factors are organ suitability , age ...
and the advance of the disease
which is determined by a specialist ?
yes , but ...
so the computers put miss garnett at the top of the list ,
but a harbor hospital doctor removed her from it ?
well ... that &apos;s an oversimplification .
did you know that jeffrey berkoff donated $ 600,000
to your hospital ?
you &apos;re far away from home .
i need your help .
okay .
what &apos;s going on with lockhart / gardner ?
you &apos;re worried about your job ?
peter florrick isn &apos;t gonna want the guy
who made an enemy of his wife .
diane was sniffing around me for a while
to have me come back , but
i think will had some concerns .
can you talk to him ?
really ?
well , i don &apos;t think that &apos;s gonna fly with miss nyholm .
$ 1 million .
well , i &apos;m sorry to hear that .
of course miss nyholm didn &apos;t tell us about berkoff .
we have our own investigator here .
he hung up on me .
i don &apos;t think he takes you seriously .
or you .
she &apos;s a piece of work , huh ?
and yet she has her moments .
congratulations on peter , by the way .
i saw his speech , it was good .
are you excited ?
i &apos;m ... busy .
i bet he will be , too .
why don &apos;t you take a week off after all this .
spend some time with him .
hello there .
you waking up ?
little sleepyhead .
you want to hear a story ?
no .
once there was ...
turn it back up .
a big castle ...
what ?
with many wonderful machines in it .
and all the machines cost a lot of money to keep up .
and so the king had to keep using the machines
and charging for their use .
good story .
and so , when all the king &apos;s horses
and all the king &apos;s men came to the castle ,
they were charged exorbitant prices .
your dad and i have separated .
you ...
what ?
why ?
because ...
we decided it was time .
i @-@ i don &apos;t understand .
why now ?
because i wanted to now .
this was all just to get dad elected , wasn &apos;t it ?
what ?
staying together .
the day after the election , you get separated .
yes , but that is not the reason why .
then why ?
i needed to see if the marriage would work .
and it hasn &apos;t .
your dad has moved into an apartment
a few miles away .
my god , we &apos;re those kids .
no , you &apos;re not those kids-- you &apos;re our kids .
i know this is hard ,
but i need you to deal with this a little while longer .
so what , do we just go back and forth ?
i don &apos;t know . we haven &apos;t worked out the details .
but i need something more from you .
people are interested in what happens to us ,
so i need you to keep our current situation
from anyone outside the family .
&apos;cause it will hurt dad ?
yes .
and it could hurt us , too .
i think that there &apos;s a lot of attention
to families like ours , and i ...
i don &apos;t want to feed that .
but , mom ... mom , it &apos;s lying .
that &apos;s hypocritical .
yes . and you two are old enough to understand that .
we don &apos;t lie here .
we ... we don &apos;t lie to each other ,
but when people want to hurt us ,
it &apos;s sometimes all right to
not tell the full truth .
you understand ?
grace ?
mom , you need to protect us more .
oh , mom , i &apos;m sorry . i didn &apos;t mean that .
no .
i love you so much .
you didn &apos;t ask for any of this .
and i ...
we &apos;re good . we &apos;re gonna be good .
we &apos;re gonna be good .
okay , so here &apos;s where we stand .
patti &apos;s clearly pointing us in a direction ,
but she &apos;s not filling in the blanks .
so see what you can get on hospital over @-@ testing .
i have someone in the hospital i can talk to .
you should give cary a chance .
a chance to what ?
come back here .
hey .
hello .
hello ?
everything all right ?
yep . got to get to work .
sure .
when did you get billed ?
uh , sorry , i must have left them at home .
i was looking at the bill and i was surprised
to see that there were tests on there
that i don &apos;t remember approving .
ct scans ?
that sounds right .
was it dr. lawton ?
yeah .
he can be a bit overcautious with the radiation scans .
he &apos;s actually been warned about it a few times .
same with the other doctors .
just challenge it .
okay . thank you .
no problem .
hey , do you want to get lunch sometime ?
oh , i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m sorry .
um , uh , forget it .
i just don &apos;t really meet that many nice people .
no , no , sure .
th @-@ that sounds nice .
give me your number .
great .
i don &apos;t believe it .
it &apos;s true .
but why ?
because she &apos;s selfish .
oh , stop it .
she won &apos;t swallow her pride .
she won &apos;t forgive him .
it &apos;s easier to leave him .
jackie , it isn &apos;t the &apos; 50s .
what did she say ?
alicia-- she said nothing .
and peter won &apos;t say anything either .
but he &apos;s devastated .
i need you to talk to her .
you need me ?
she likes you .
you can explain things .
you know it &apos;s bad for peter .
it &apos;s bad for home , it &apos;s bad for work .
the itsy @-@ bitsy spider
went up the waterspout ...
i &apos;m sorry , your honor .
this is the only way i can get her to fall asleep .
oh , that &apos;s okay , really .
let me guess-- you couldn &apos;t find day care ,
again .
your honor , we would like introduce something
into evidence we were hoping to avoid .
oh , i &apos;m sure you were .
our firm wanted to relieve miss nyholm of her duties quietly ,
because , the truth is ,
we discovered she was stealing clients .
miss nyholm tried to steal their business
and start her own firm .
well ?
of course i was trying to start my own firm ,
because i knew they were trying to fire me .
yeah , but they weren &apos;t trying to fire you
because you were pregnant .
they were trying to fire me because i have a working vagina .
and because jerry maguire
roda out there is their new golden boy .
of course it was about my pregnancy .
is there an e @-@ mail out there saying that ? no .
would you write that e @-@ mail , will ?
of course not , but you &apos;d still do it .
take all the cases away from the pregnant woman
and give them to the new harvard boy with the penis .
where are we ?
cross @-@ examination of the hospital administrator .
hit them hard ,
because what happens there is scaring them here .
hello , dr. lawton .
you &apos;re marjorie garnett &apos;s specialist ?
yes , i am .
and you &apos;re the doctor who decided her condition was so extreme
you removed her from transplant consideration ?
well , i was the doctor who examined her
and tested her and found
her liver tumor had exceeded five centimeters ,
which is routinely the cutoff for patient viability .
you mentioned testing .
how many ct scans did you run on marjorie ?
excuse me , your honor .
objection . relevance ?
i &apos;m asking about marjorie &apos;s care .
it seems essentially relevant .
overruled . you may answer , doctor .
i believe i ran three ct scans .
why ?
why did i run three ?
sometimes i like to be more thorough .
you seem to frequently be more thorough .
didn &apos;t the hospital warn you
about your overuse of radiation testing ?
objection , your honor . again .
this is a fishing expedition .
okay . i admit to being lost here .
what fish are you afraid mrs. florrick is chasing ?
she is attempting to use an ongoing investigation
into harbor hospital into ...
excuse me .
i think the word you &apos;re looking for is over @-@ testing .
your honor , we request a short recess
to talk with the plaintiff &apos;s attorney .
anything that gets us to a settlement , i am all for .
we have a sworn affidavit from the donor databank .
we knew nothing about the next potential donee on that list .
it was completely blind .
it doesn &apos;t matter what you knew .
it matters what dr. lawton knew .
but you &apos;re not looking closely enough .
dr. lawton didn &apos;t know .
no one knew who the computers would assign that liver to .
we still have you on over @-@ testing .
yes , you do , ma &apos;am .
and we &apos;re vulnerable on that front ,
but that still doesn &apos;t change the fact
that you &apos;re stealing a liver
from one worthy candidate to give to another .
we have looked at your worthy candidate .
he &apos;s ten months away from death .
i &apos;m fighting your suit ,
ms. lockhart , mrs. florrick ,
and you know why ?
because we &apos;re right .
this is not about saving the hospital money .
this is about preserving the integrity of the donor list .
marjorie garnett is near death ,
and she needs to accept that fact .
you two need to , as well .
i heard .
we have 12 hours .
yes .
we haven &apos;t given up yet .
i know .
i haven &apos;t , either .
as far as we can tell , the doctors didn &apos;t know
the organ would go to jeffrey berkoff ,
so we don &apos;t have that avenue anymore .
you know ,
i loved being a mom .
if i had it to do all over again , i ...
i would have done it differently .
really ?
it looks like it was fun .
well , i wouldn &apos;t have done it all differently .
i don &apos;t want to die .
what will he remember of me ?
has dr. lawton seen these ?
oh , yeah .
he says i was quite the partier .
it &apos;s just odd .
last time i was here , you were firing me .
a lot of water under that bridge .
so , cary , you &apos;ve proven yourself valuable
in the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s office ,
and we &apos;re starting to look to expand ,
but we &apos;re always wanting a ...
... balance of personalities .
okay .
i guess i &apos;m wondering , will you still fit in here ?
well , i have done a lot of growing , being away .
so i want to fit in ,
wherever i go .
and you won &apos;t mind coming over to the dark side ?
i think i &apos;ll find it a challenge .
so you &apos;d be willing to come back as a second @-@ year associate .
that won &apos;t feel like a step down ?
thought i &apos;d be coming back as a third @-@ year .
yes . but your second year
was with the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s office , so ...
it &apos;s only a title , cary .
we &apos;d still offer all of the perks and salary bumps
that i discussed .
sorry .
look , i &apos;ve seen the way third @-@ years treat second @-@ years .
it &apos;s not just a title .
cary , listen . we &apos;re growing again .
and as we grow , we &apos;re hiring people back .
and we can &apos;t break precedent by giving something to you
that we don &apos;t give to others .
think about it , cary .
and alicia will be a third @-@ year ?
eli , i have to prepare for a cross @-@ examination .
this will only take a minute .
and it &apos;s important .
i &apos;m about to argue for a woman &apos;s life .
is it more important than that ?
okay , i thought i could top that .
no .
you separated from peter .
peter told you ?
jackie .
the second that phone rings , i have to go .
is it irrevocable ?
my decision to leave peter ?
yes .
okay . wait .
does that mean it will change or ... ?
no , it won &apos;t .
i don &apos;t want to ask you why ,
but you do know this will look politically motivated .
not the separation , the marriage .
i &apos;ve already talked to zach and grace .
and you should talk to peter .
it will hurt everyone if this becomes a big thing .
yeah . okay .
have you thought about couple &apos;s counseling ?
no .
i know i &apos;m not the best advertisement for it ,
but my ex @-@ wife and i went through it .
and it wasn &apos;t ... as bad as i thought .
thank you .
and thank you for not trying to talk me out of it .
should i try ?
gotta go .
go save a life .
dr. lawton ,
who is marcus orr , sheryl kirk
and gabriel elba ?
they are my patients .
and like marjorie , they suffered from liver failure ?
yes .
but unlike marjorie ,
they received liver transplants .
how many ct scans did you order performed on each ?
i don &apos;t remember .
one ?
that sounds about right .
and who are leelee basso , cynthia hickey and linda gould ?
also my patients .
and how many ct scans did you perform on them ?
again , you &apos;re going to have to tell me .
three , four and five .
which is odd ,
being that the last three patients , and my client ,
are almost 20 years younger .
well , as i said , age is not always a determining factor .
yes , but appearance seems to be .
objection .
sustained .
dr. lawton , of all your liver patients ,
these are the only four patients
with tattoos and body piercings .
i- i don &apos;t remember , i don &apos;t keep track .
during your examination of marjorie ,
you asked her how much alcohol
she consumed in her youth , is that correct ?
i don &apos;t know . probably .
and why is that important to know ?
well , it &apos;s not essential to know .
it helps contribute to a fuller picture of the patient &apos;s lifestyle .
and why is lifestyle important ?
well , as a doctor ...
how shall i put this ?
any way you want .
lifestyle matters to the future health of a patient .
are you more likely to downgrade the status
of a woman you blame for her liver condition ?
no .
then how can you explain the need
for subjecting these four patients-- and only these four patients--
to additional ct scans ?
i don &apos;t think i- i have to explain .
i am a very careful doctor .
this is the most i can offer .
i am having another doctor
look over the first cat scans ,
and if he doesn &apos;t find anything irregular in miss garnett &apos;s test ,
we &apos;ll hopefully have time to reassess .
not much time . six hours .
then i &apos;d better get going .
there &apos;s a chance .
oh , my god .
nothing &apos;s certain yet .
thank you , mr. haynes , for taking a closer look
at dr. lawton &apos;s overuse of cat scans .
and thank you for determining there was bias there .
i would object to that characterization .
mr. haynes reversed dr. lawton &apos;s decision
in the case of marjorie garnett .
he did this for humanitarian reasons :
to save miss garnett &apos;s life .
and once again , thank you .
but that has no impact on this negotiation : your class action .
well , it sure doesn &apos;t look good .
there are four patients we know already
who suffered from dr. lawton &apos;s bias .
my guess is we turn up more .
my guess is bias is in the eye of the beholder .
well , it &apos;s too bad we have a former lawyer of yours
who can help us on that front .
i am so sorry i &apos;m late . are we all playing nice in here ?
very nice .
you ...
yep .
they fired roda , and asked me back .
isn &apos;t it great ?
with better benefits .
so i dropped the lawsuit .
but thank you so much , will .
really .
it probably wouldn &apos;t have happened without you .
we &apos;ll object to your using anything you discovered from us .
i couldn &apos;t have discovered anything from you ,
because you stood up in court
and swore to a strict separation of these cases .
so . shall we get started ?
no .
we &apos;re talking .
we talked .
we &apos;re talking some more .
i don &apos;t want our children hearing this .
i phoned a marriage counselor .
her name is anne gerbadine .
she &apos;s very thorough , she seems very smart ,
and i &apos;m going to start seeing her next week .
i don &apos;t want to lose you , alicia .
if you ask me to give up the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s office today ,
i &apos;d do it in a heartbeat .
lucky me .
i know you &apos;re hurt .
i know you &apos;re angry ...
no , peter .
it &apos;s a &quot; no . &quot;
what is ?
everything .
counseling .
an explanation .
anything you ask , anything you say .
you &apos;re sleeping with will , aren &apos;t you ?
that &apos;s what this is about , isn &apos;t it ?
you and will .
there have been three people in this marriage .
every moment of the last two years ,
you &apos;ve been thinking about him .
go ahead , tell me that &apos;s not true .
oh , my god , the gall !
i &apos;ll take the blame for what i did . i &apos;ll take it happily .
but you share that .
is that why you &apos;re here ?
to disperse blame ?
really ?
that &apos;s the saddest thing i &apos;ve ever heard .
are you divorcing me ?
i haven &apos;t decided .
well , please , let me know when you decide .
yep . you and kalinda . i &apos;ve got her number , too .
she &apos;s blameless in this .
oh , really ?
did you rape her ?
she didn &apos;t even know you then .
she knew you were married .
it &apos;s okay . it &apos;s all right , alicia .
have at it .
you &apos;re the injured one .
no one else .
there &apos;s nothing anyone can say , right ?
yes , there is .
so say something . say something , peter .
say something that &apos;ll make me fall in love with you again .
good @-@ bye .
yep . you got that right .
well , you must be thinking about the old peter florrick ,
because i &apos;m not in the favor @-@ granting mood today .
yeah ?
cary agos , mr. florrick .
i work in the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s office .
i &apos;m not making any hiring or firing decisions .
i understand that . i just want to ...
you understand that , but you &apos;re still here .
i don &apos;t want you to be biased against me
because of my first job .
all decisions will be based on
seniority and departmental needs .
i just ...
i know alicia and i , we &apos;ve had our differences .
and at first , i thought the best thing was just to let it go .
but i think it &apos;s better to explain things .
and you know alicia from ... ?
