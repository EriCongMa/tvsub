what do you mean you can &apos;t take the case ?
jessica won &apos;t lay out the money for the man @-@ hours .
one of the victims was my uncle keith .
please . these people need your help .
i didn &apos;t come forward . they found me .
and i &apos;m not pulling any associate shit .
then what do you call
this pathetic excuse of a candidates list ?
i call it inevitable , because our students can read .
our future is slipping away , and offering jack
name partner or praying to god that harvey
just gets mike off the hook
isn &apos;t gonna stop it from happening .
then you get your ass back up to harvard ,
and you make sure sheila doesn &apos;t show up to that trial .
it &apos;s a ticket to argentina .
i need you to go there until the trial &apos;s over .
court &apos;s not about bullshit like this ; it &apos;s about facts .
and the fact is , you &apos;re not a goddamn lawyer .
are you saying what i think you &apos;re saying ?
because if you &apos;re thinking it , you &apos;re a fool .
you heard her .
she said &quot; the fact is , is that i &apos;m not a goddamn lawyer . &quot;
well , the only way to change that fact
is for a jury to see me be a goddamn lawyer .
you try that , all they &apos;re gonna see
is someone going to prison .
it &apos;s my call , and i &apos;m making it .
we have a problem . they found trevor .
please raise your right hand .
do you swear to tell the truth ,
the whole truth ,
and nothing but the truth ,
so help you god ?
i do .
you may be seated .
mr. evans , how long have you known mr. ross ?
since we were kids . almost 20 years .
so you were close to him ?
yeah , he was my best friend .
are you still close to him ?
well , i doubt we will be after this .
after what ?
after you ask me about the series of events
that have led us all to be here today .
well , we &apos;ll get to your history in a minute ,
but first , i want to ask you a question about current events .
did mike ross approach you three days ago
in an attempt to get you not to testify against him ?
yes , he did .
how exactly did that conversation go ?
what are you doing here ?
you know exactly what i &apos;m doing here .
you said you would not testify .
yeah , well , that was before anita gibbs dragged me in
and told me she was gonna put me away for ten years .
i don &apos;t give a shit what she told you .
you said you were gonna call a lawyer .
yeah , well , before i had a chance to do that ,
they showed me what they had ,
which is names , dates , witnesses , and everything else
they need to put me away for as long as they want .
wait , wait , how would they have--
you think i want to do this ?
i don &apos;t .
but i cannot risk prison for you .
and i am telling you that whatever they have ,
harvey can get you out of this .
and from what she told me ,
gibbs can get you out of this .
she offered you a deal that can make this whole thing stop .
now , instead of telling me not to testify against you ,
why don &apos;t you think about testifying against harvey ?
because unlike you , i would never do that to a friend !
yeah , well , unlike you , when they put me away ,
i &apos;m not going to a white @-@ collar prison .
so if i don &apos;t rip you to shreds up there on the stand ,
they &apos;re gonna rip me to shreds behind bars .
harvey , it &apos;s late . i &apos;ve had a long day .
so if you don &apos;t mind ...
we have a problem .
what now ? my condo &apos;s on fire ?
mike wants to represent himself .
is he crazy ? he can &apos;t do that .
that &apos;s what i tried to tell him .
you don &apos;t try ; you just tell him .
yeah , the only problem with that is ,
he knows it &apos;s his decision .
not to mention , the only thing that &apos;s stopping him
from going to gibbs and pointing his finger
at you or me is his loyalty to us .
so that &apos;s it ?
he &apos;s representing himself ?
i &apos;m not saying that .
then what exactly are you saying ?
i &apos;m saying i have a plan ,
but i need you to sign off on it .
oh , whatever it is , i &apos;m in .
because if that kid handles his own defense ,
you and i are going to be the next ones on trial .
if you &apos;re here to find out if trevor &apos;s testifying , he is .
i can handle trevor .
harvey , we &apos;ve been over this .
and i said we &apos;re not done being over it .
listen to me , i know that fool @-@ for @-@ a @-@ client bullshit .
but the thing i &apos;m being accused of is not being a lawyer .
so if i represent myself , every second i &apos;m up there ,
they &apos;re gonna see me as a lawyer .
and if she rattles you for one of those goddamn seconds ,
they &apos;re gonna see you as a fraud , and they &apos;re never
gonna see you as anything else .
okay .
i got it . you said your piece .
it &apos;s my call . i &apos;m done talking about it .
then we &apos;ll do a trial run to get you ready .
are you crazy ?
you want to waste my time , not to mention
air our dirty laundry , in front of the whole firm ?
mike , in a week and a half , our dirty laundry is gonna be
aired in front of the whole world .
and gibbs is gonna come at you in ways
you &apos;ve never even thought about .
oh , so i get it . you don &apos;t want a trial run to get me ready ;
you want a trial run to show me that i &apos;m outmatched .
you are outmatched by me and gibbs ,
and you &apos;re afraid to find out .
i &apos;m not afraid of gibbs , and i am not afraid of you .
then you won &apos;t mind agreeing , if i beat you ,
you let me represent you in court .
okay , harvey , you want to go ?
let &apos;s go .
but you better bring your a game .
because you might be the best closer in the city ,
but i &apos;m the one fighting for my life .
第五季 第十四集
thank you .
there he is .
harold .
what are you doing here ?
i know what &apos;s going on , okay ?
i know about the trial coming up .
then you know i &apos;m pretty busy right now .
right , which is why i wanted to talk to you .
listen , you &apos;re gonna need someone to testify
that you went to harvard .
i want to be that guy .
harold , that &apos;s an amazing offer , but--
mike , come on , man .
we both know that you didn &apos;t go to harvard .
but honestly , if anyone would have asked me up until this point ,
i would have sworn that you did .
i would have sworn that i saw you
at that--that party with gilcrest
or those pizza nights at pinocchio &apos;s
or pretty much any other memory i have of that time ,
which means , if they put me up there on that stand ,
i &apos;d basically be telling the truth .
i can &apos;t tell you how much that means to me , harold , but ...
mike , i want to do this for you , please .
i know you do .
but i got myself into this mess ,
and i got to get myself out of it .
okay .
but listen , if you change your mind ,
you know where to find me .
ladies and gentlemen of the jury ,
you &apos;re gonna be hearing a lot of things
over the next several days ,
but the truth is , this case is about
nothing more than cold , hard--
innuendo .
and the fact is , i &apos;m capable of reciting every element
of jurisprudence in the state of new york .
and yet despite that , the prosecution is gonna
try to convince you that i am a--
fraud , who not only didn &apos;t pass the bar or go
to law school , he didn &apos;t even graduate college .
there isn &apos;t one piece of hard evidence
proving that i didn &apos;t go to harvard law .
there &apos;s no record of tuition being paid .
no record of a boston address .
there isn &apos;t even a simple picture in the yearbook .
let &apos;s talk about the yearbook .
as he told you , i &apos;m not in the yearbook .
where is mike ross ?
though what he didn &apos;t tell you is that
25 other students are also not in this yearbook .
are those other students being charged with fraud ?
of course not , because we don &apos;t put people on trial
for being sick on picture day , and no matter--
what he says , the fact is , mike ross is not a lawyer .
he &apos;s a fraud .
and we will prove that beyond a shadow of a doubt .
the defense would like to call its first witness .
right there-- he &apos;s such a non @-@ lawyer ,
he doesn &apos;t even know the prosecution goes first .
and you obviously don &apos;t know
jarvis v. the state of new york , 1937,
when calling of the first witness
is of such special nature as to disrupt
the flow of the trial once it &apos;s started .
what the hell special nature are you talking about ?
when the defense wants to call the prosecutor
as its first witness .
harvey , unless you have something to overturn this ,
i &apos;m gonna need you to have a seat .
mr. specter , you said there &apos;s no record of me
ever having an apartment in boston .
can you explain to the jury why there &apos;s no record
of you ever having lived there ?
i &apos;m not the one on trial here .
no , you &apos;re not .
you &apos;re the one in that chair ,
so why don &apos;t you answer the question ,
or we can stop this whole thing right now .
there &apos;s no record of me living there
because i sublet up there when i had my place down here .
so it is possible
that a person not have a boston address
without it meaning that they didn &apos;t attend harvard .
great . thank you so much .
this witness is excused .
and what , exactly , is your reason
for not having an address up there ?
unless you &apos;re too afraid to answer my questions .
no , i &apos;m not afraid of you at all .
my reason is that i chose to live with my friend
trevor during that time .
the only problem with that is ,
your friend trevor has lived in brooklyn his entire life .
exactly a 3 hour and 20 minute drive from harvard .
so you &apos;re saying you made that drive every day ?
no , i only went up for tests
because that &apos;s all i had to do .
i guess you needed some extra tutoring , huh ?
you expect these people to believe that you graduated
from the most competitive law school in the world
without ever going to class ?
see , that &apos;s funny , because you actually
expect these people to believe
that i never went to law school at all
and yet still somehow managed to convince
the smartest lawyers in the world
to make me their youngest partner ever .
whose story is looking more far @-@ fetched now ?
oh , no answer ? great .
no more questions , your honor .
i don &apos;t know if you &apos;ve noticed this or not ,
but he &apos;s kicking your ass .
and i &apos;m about to kick back .
are you two discussing something
that defense should be made aware of ?
just talking about the knicks .
now is the prosecution ready to call their first witness ?
the prosecution &apos;s first witness is this affidavit
from every single member of the defendant &apos;s
supposed graduating class .
objection , your honor . i haven &apos;t seen that .
well , then let me read it to you .
&quot; we collectively come forward to swear
the following regarding michael james ross :
we never saw him . we never knew him .
we never heard of him .
and it makes us sick that he &apos;s taking the good name
of harvard law school and throwing it down the toilet .
please find him guilty on all counts . &quot;
your honor , i move to strike that document right now .
on what grounds ?
on the grounds that it &apos;s completely fabricated .
where &apos;s your proof ?
besides the fact that i actually went to harvard ,
there &apos;s no way you could have contacted
all of those people since last night .
then i suggest you call every one of these people
and put them on the stand .
but when you do , every single one of them is gonna
look you in the eye and say , &quot; who the hell are you ? &quot;
what ? no snappy comeback ?
you can try to trick these people all you want .
but the fact is , you didn &apos;t go to harvard ,
and this proves it .
objection . he &apos;s testifying .
what i &apos;m doing is winning .
all right , that &apos;s enough .
i think this is a good time to take a break .
louis litt .
i &apos;m anita gibbs .
yeah , i know who you are .
question is , what are you doing here ?
and the answer is , i don &apos;t give a shit .
i came here to compliment you
on getting rid of sheila sazs .
i have no idea what you &apos;re talking about .
really ? you think i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on here ?
you two were in a relationship , and when you found out
that it was her that wrote that email ,
you went up to cambridge and convinced her to go to
argentina for the duration of the trial .
you &apos;re out of your mind .
am i ?
you flew to boston three times in the last two weeks .
you took two cabs to her house
and another to within 100 feet of the admissions office .
you have no proof of anything .
i don &apos;t need proof .
because while she may be in argentina now ,
she &apos;s not gonna stay there forever ,
which means when she gets back ,
i get you for witness tampering .
do me a favor and leave me the hell alone .
i will .
for now .
but if she &apos;s not back by the start of trial ,
i &apos;m gonna assume that you want to be brought up on charges .
you son of a bitch . this isn &apos;t real .
i don &apos;t give a shit whether it &apos;s real or not .
you think gibbs isn &apos;t gonna do things like that ?
she is not gonna enter false evidence , and you know it .
but she is gonna set up traps for you
to bungle into like i just did .
this is such bullshit .
you are just pissed because i was kicking your ass
so now you &apos;re cheating .
me ?
you &apos;re the one who testified in your
opening statement and every chance you get .
because that &apos;s exactly what me being my own lawyer gives us .
i don &apos;t care .
if i represent you and it turns out that you need to testify ,
we can call you up to the stand .
and if we do that ,
then gibbs gets to cross @-@ examine me
and make me look like a liar .
well , i don &apos;t know if you &apos;ve noticed ,
but you &apos;re looking like a liar right now .
and i &apos;m trying to keep you from looking like a fool .
you know what ? i &apos;m getting pretty tired of you using that word with me .
too bad , because for all your bullshit up there ,
you still can &apos;t produce one person who remembers you from harvard .
so if you want to have a chance at representing yourself ,
get out of my face and go work on your defense
&apos;cause i got a lot more where that came from .
what can i do for you , louis ?
gibbs knows what i did .
what ?
she knows i got sheila out of the country .
she was waiting for me this morning ,
and she threatened to bring charges against me .
did you admit that to her ?
no .
then she &apos;s not gonna charge you with anything .
did you hear what i just said ?
she knows i went to sheila &apos;s place
the same night she went to argentina .
and what does that prove ?
it proves that i knowingly
bought a witness a ticket out of the country
in the middle of an ongoing investigation .
all it proves is , you rewarded a harvard employee
who &apos;s been steering lawyers towards this firm
for the last ten years .
okay , jessica , gibbs can easily go down to argentina
and ask sheila--
louis , listen to yourself .
she &apos;s not going to do that .
and even if she did ,
it &apos;s not witness tampering
if a subpoena was never issued .
then gibbs is gonna say that i had knowledge
of an impending subpoena ; therefore it is tampering .
you know what , louis ?
i don &apos;t give a shit what gibbs says .
where are you going ?
give that woman a taste of her own goddamn medicine .
where the hell are you going ?
we &apos;ve got mike on the ropes ;
we have to put him away .
sorry , harvey .
something more pressing just came up .
what the hell could be more pressing than this ?
you worry about your shit , and i &apos;ll worry about mine .
oh , i &apos;ve got my shit taken care of .
well , maybe you do , and maybe you don &apos;t .
but what i &apos;ve learned from recent history is ,
if you really were anita gibbs ,
no matter what you had planned ,
you &apos;d be planning something else .
donna , please , not right now .
i &apos;m so busy .
that &apos;s fine .
i just came by to let you know that
jessica had to go out ,
so the trial is done for the rest of the day .
and harvey wasn &apos;t gonna tell me
because he &apos;s playing dirty .
he &apos;s not your enemy , mike .
he &apos;s just doing what he thinks is best .
then i &apos;m gonna do what i think is best .
and what exactly is that ?
look , donna , he may not be my enemy ,
and you may not be my enemy ,
but as long as we &apos;re in this trial run ,
i &apos;m not trusting you with anything .
that &apos;s my boy .
jessica pearson ,
i wasn &apos;t aware we had an appointment today .
we don &apos;t .
i just stopped by to give you this restraining order ,
preventing you from contacting louis litt
without his attorney present .
and let me guess-- his attorney is you .
bingo .
so unless you &apos;re going to arrest him ,
you so much as text him without me present ,
and you &apos;re in violation of a court order .
you &apos;re done driving a wedge between me and my people .
we &apos;ll see how strong your bond is with your people
when i parade every one of them on the stand
and ask them point @-@ blank ,
&quot; did you know mike ross was a fraud ? &quot;
you think we &apos;re gonna have different answers to that ?
no , i think you &apos;re all gonna take the fifth .
and you &apos;re gonna tell yourselves it implies no guilt ,
but in the eyes of the jury ,
you might as well all just stand up there and say he did it .
so you tell your client he &apos;s off the hook for now .
but the next time i talk to him ,
it will be on the stand .
hey , i got your message .
so here i am .
but let me tell you something , mike ,
if you &apos;re here to ask what i think you &apos;re gonna ask ,
gonna be a short conversation .
i need you to say you remember me from harvard .
there &apos;s just one small problem , mike .
i don &apos;t remember you .
&apos;cause you didn &apos;t go there , did you ?
look me in the eye and tell me that i &apos;m wrong .
god damn you , mike . i--i knew it .
jimmy--jimmy !
when we first started ,
you begged me to help you save your career .
no , no , no , no , mike . this is not the same thing .
i @-@ i could have gotten you disbarred .
but it couldn &apos;t have got me sent to jail , and you know it .
i don &apos;t care ! all right ?
i need your help .
mike , you are asking me to perjure myself ,
and i don &apos;t even know who you are .
yes , you do .
i am the same guy you came to when your aunt needed help .
what ? so i owe you for that too ?
yeah , you do .
you and i both know if i get convicted ,
that settlement &apos;s gonna get reopened .
then why the hell did you take it , mike ?
why ?
jimmy , i took a shortcut , man .
just like you took a shortcut once .
now , if i could take it all back , i would ,
but i can &apos;t .
and just like you begged me once ,
i am coming to you and begging you right now .
please .
please help me .
no one in their right mind
would do what you &apos;re asking me to .
that &apos;s not true .
harold come to you ?
mm @-@ hmm .
but you know harold
won &apos;t hold up on the stand and i would .
right ?
jimmy , i need you--
michael .
look , brother , i &apos;m sorry .
i really wish i could help ,
but i cannot risk going to prison for you .
i can &apos;t .
hello ?
louis , it &apos;s me .
sheila , i explicitly told you ,
&quot; do not call me until after the trial is over . &quot;
we can &apos;t take any chances--
someone approached me , louis .
what do you mean someone approached you ?
at my hotel .
i was in the lobby .
a man came up to me and started talking .
he said he was from new york .
he wanted to know how long i &apos;d been
planning a trip to argentina .
then he asked how long i was planning on staying
and , finally , did anyone pay
for my ticket to come down here ?
w @-@ what did you tell him ?
that it was none of his business .
good . that was smart .
you didn &apos;t show them that they got to you .
louis , they did get to me .
listen to me .
they did not subpoena you , so you did nothing wrong .
you just took a trip .
now , if gibbs can prove anyone did anything , it is me .
and i will do anything to protect you , okay ?
i &apos;m sorry , louis . i have to go .
i don &apos;t believe you .
you &apos;re calling rachel as your first witness ?
i sure as hell am .
gibbs can &apos;t call rachel . we took care of that .
we took care of her going out of bounds
to get rachel to turn on you .
we didn &apos;t do anything to stop her calling rachel
to the stand , and you know it .
fine , then i &apos;m stipulating right now
rachel &apos;s taking the fifth to any questions .
oh , bullshit .
you know as well as i do ,
she can &apos;t take the fifth to personal questions .
so you &apos;re just gonna humiliate her
so you can rattle me ?
you &apos;re damn right i am .
gibbs is gonna do the exact same thing .
she is not gonna do that to rachel
in front of a jury , because it will make her look like shit .
she doesn &apos;t care about that .
no , you &apos;re the one that doesn &apos;t care about that .
&apos;cause this is no longer about what &apos;s best for my case ;
it &apos;s because you don &apos;t want to lose to me .
i &apos;m not going to lose to you .
you know what , harvey ? i am--
that &apos;s enough .
while you two have been having your pissing contest ,
i &apos;ve been poring over discovery ,
and i came across the class rankings from mike &apos;s first year .
don &apos;t tell me-- he &apos;s not on it .
no , he &apos;s not .
doesn &apos;t make any sense .
yes , it does .
lola must not have covered all the bases .
then we need to get her to cover all the bases .
are you out of your mind ?
you go to lola , you lead gibbs right to her ,
and this thing is over before it even gets started .
okay , then we get benjamin to do it .
we are not letting another person in on your secret .
well , then what do you suggest we do ?
what we were gonna do with every other piece
of evidence that makes us look like shit .
we find a way to make it look like shit .
there is no way that harvard accidentally forgets
to put a student on this list .
i say we go to benjamin .
and i say i &apos;ll lock you in a room
until this trial starts if you say that again .
then i guess whoever wins makes the call .
you go to benjamin behind my back before we &apos;re done ,
and you going to prison is gonna be
the least of your problems .
mike , you like you &apos;ve been through the wringer .
i have to ask you a question , and ...
i want you to tell me the truth .
well , of course .
do you really think i should be the one up there
fighting for my life , or do you think harvey should be ?
i think that ...
you &apos;re the best person to make that call ,
and that whatever you decide , i &apos;m with you 100 % .
well , then i need to ask benjamin to do something for us ,
and harvey is really not gonna like it .
whatever it is , if you think we need to do it ,
i &apos;m with you .
迈克尔 · 詹姆斯 · 罗斯
it &apos;s done ?
yes .
it won &apos;t hold up forever , but it will hold up for now .
thank you , benjamin . i--
i didn &apos;t expect it for a couple of hours .
i @-@ i haven &apos;t had a chance to get you any bacon .
that &apos;s quite all right , michael .
this one is on the house .
you know , you never asked if what
they &apos;re saying about me is true .
i didn &apos;t need to .
i knew it was true the second i heard it .
i don &apos;t understand .
all these kids who went to harvard ,
they never gave me the time of day .
all they cared about was letting me know
where they went to school and i didn &apos;t .
you &apos;ve never done that to me .
not one time .
i--i don &apos;t know what to say .
say that when you &apos;re done and you &apos;ve beaten this thing ,
you won &apos;t start acting like some asshole who went to harvard .
well , i mean , can &apos;t really promise you that , benjamin .
i &apos;ll have gone to harvard .
that &apos;s not funny , michael .
is the prosecution ready to call its next witness ?
prosecution calls rachel zane .
objection .
your honor , the witness cannot object to testifying
simply because she intends to take the fifth .
the witness doesn &apos;t have to testify because she &apos;s my wife .
what ?
i have a marriage certificate here
from the state of nevada showing that
the witness and i were married in las vegas
six weeks after we started dating .
both of you up here , now .
where the hell did you get that ?
what do you mean ?
you didn &apos;t marry her , and you know it .
then why do i have everything i need proving i did ?
because you did some bullshit to get out of this .
oh , look who &apos;s crying about it now .
keep your voices down .
you think this is a joke ?
you try this in court ,
gibbs is gonna prove you &apos;re not married ,
and rachel &apos;s gonna go to jail for perjury .
he &apos;s right ; you better know what the hell you &apos;re doing .
who said that i was gonna use this in the real trial ?
i get it . this is a fake , just like you .
i said keep your goddamn voice down .
this is as real as that affidavit was , okay ?
now , you wanted to rattle me ; i &apos;ve rattled you .
what are you gonna do about it ?
prosecution calls rachel zane to the stand .
objection . we just went over this .
when spousal privilege is invoked in the moment ,
prosecution has the right to challenge
the validity of the marriage .
this is ridiculous .
objection overruled .
ms. zane , take the stand .
we can skip swearing her in
since she &apos;s just gonna lie about it , anyway .
objection !
ms. zane , if you got married six weeks after dating the defendant ,
why are you engaged to him right now ?
because we did it on a whim .
and we had planned to have an annulment ,
but once we fell more in love , we thought that it
might be wonderful to reveal it to our families
after we were married again .
and how , exactly , did it go
when you got married the first time ?
we were in las vegas--
yeah , yeah , i don &apos;t give a shit where you were .
what color was your dress ? what color was the cake ?
objection .
who was there ?
were there any witnesses ?
your honor , he &apos;s badgering--
who were the witnesses ? and what goddamn time was it ?
your honor , get him off of her !
harvey ...
tell me right now .
let the witness answer .
the dress was white .
and the cake was vanilla with a buttercream frosting .
it was a small ceremony at around 10 : 00 p.m.
and i remember the man who married us
like it was yesterday
because it was the most special day of my life .
and when you came up with this story ,
did mr. ross at least give you the courtesy of
letting you make up your own memories of your supposedly sacred day ?
objection .
since , if he represents himself at trial ,
you won &apos;t have a real wedding for at least two to five years .
harvey .
and i &apos;ve got one more question :
did you vow to remain faithful to mr. ross
throughout your marriage ?
yes , i did .
yeah , then i guess when you cheated on him
with logan sanders , it means you lied to him
at that non @-@ existent ceremony ,
just like you &apos;re lying to all of us right now .
that &apos;s enough .
if you want to bring more outside information
to dispute this marriage , feel free , but for right now ...
this witness is excused .
louis , whatever it is , it &apos;s going to have to wait .
no , it &apos;s not gonna wait ,
because you said you &apos;d take care of gibbs .
i did take care of gibbs .
well , then why the hell did someone from her office
contact sheila in argentina ?
louis , they &apos;re just trying to scare you .
and even if she tells them everything ,
you did nothing wrong with sheila .
what about what we did with mike ?
the only proof they &apos;ll ever have that we knew about mike
is if we tell them .
and when they ask me , i &apos;m going to take the fifth ,
and you are going to do the same thing .
that is not good enough .
i don &apos;t want to take the fifth .
excuse me ?
you heard me .
you get called first , you get up there ,
and you look them straight in the eye ,
and you tell them mike went to harvard .
it was your decision to hire him ,
and you stand by it 100 % .
what &apos;s going on ?
what &apos;s going on is that jessica &apos;s happy asking me
to witness tamper , but when it comes to her
getting on the stand , she won &apos;t--
witness tamper ? what did you have him do ?
she had me move sheila out of the country .
are you crazy ?
look , i did what i had to do .
then why won &apos;t you do what you have to do for me ?
because if i did that , it would open me up to perjury .
if mike gets convicted ,
what does it matter if you perjure yourself ?
both of you be quiet .
look who &apos;s coming .
look who it is . the three musketeers .
and we happen to be in the middle of a meeting .
that &apos;s okay ; i just dropped by to let you know
it looks like the trial &apos;s been moved up till tomorrow .
what the hell did you do ?
i went to the judge , and i said , &quot; your honor ,
&quot; i &apos;d like to start this thing before
every single witness i have disappears . &quot;
no way she granted this without us present .
oh , you can fight it , if you want .
we &apos;ll wait for ms. sazs to finish her trip .
oh , mr. litt seems upset about that .
looks like the wedge i &apos;m driving between you
is starting to work .
your wedge hasn &apos;t done shit .
and i &apos;m gonna tell you something else .
you put me on that stand ,
and i will look the jury straight in the eye
and tell them that mike ross is the best
goddamn harvard @-@ educated attorney i have ever met .
i hired him .
it was my decision , and i stand by it 100 % .
and everyone that comes after me
will say the same thing .
you think she bought that ?
i don &apos;t care if she bought it or not .
i wasn &apos;t bluffing .
and you and mike better figure out
what the hell you &apos;re going to do
because the trial starts tomorrow .
what a coincidence running into you here
twice in one week .
you can skip trying to cheer me up ,
because it &apos;s not gonna work .
rachel--
i don &apos;t want to hear it .
he humiliated me in front of the entire firm .
yeah , he did .
but you weren &apos;t sure if mike could handle this or not .
and at least now , if he can &apos;t ,
you won &apos;t have to be the one to tell him .
that is so easy for you to say , because you have no idea
what it felt like to go through that .
you &apos;re wrong .
i know exactly what it feels like .
what are you talking about ?
try to imagine how he treated me when i left him for louis .
maybe you do know .
yeah . i do .
and ...
i also know that , like nobody else ,
harvey has this ability
to just shut off and not see you as a person anymore .
well , that ability makes me sick .
it &apos;s also probably one of the things
that makes him such a great lawyer .
what are you doing here ?
we got a problem .
you mean besides what you did today ?
mike , listen to me .
no , you listen to me .
that was over the line--
the trial starts tomorrow .
what ?
no . gibbs can &apos;t do that .
technically she can &apos;t ,
but trust me , we don &apos;t have a leg to stand on .
fine .
then i &apos;m filing the motion to be my own attorney .
mike--no .
i don &apos;t want to hear it .
you didn &apos;t beat me , all right ?
so you can be second chair or no chair , but i am first chair .
god damn it , mike .
you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re doing .
do you really think i &apos;m gonna let you
protect me after what you did to rachel today ?
i did that to rachel for you ,
and if you can &apos;t see that , you can &apos;t win this trial .
i can , and i will !
that &apos;s enough !
rachel , it &apos;s fine . i can handle this .
i don &apos;t care . i don &apos;t want you to handle this .
what ?
you said you were with me 100 % .
was that a lie ?
no , but what harvey had to do to me today was brutal ,
and whoever ends up representing you has to do
the same thing to trevor .
you don &apos;t think i can do the same thing to trevor ?
i know you can .
but i hated harvey while he was doing it to me ,
and they &apos;re going to hate you
while you &apos;re doing it to trevor .
and , mike , we can &apos;t have the jury hating you ,
but we can let them hate harvey .
mr. evans , is it true that you were living with mr. ross
in and around the time he claims to have attended harvard ?
yes , we shared an apartment
at 5307 huntington boulevard in brooklyn .
and how exactly did he pay his rent ?
he worked as a bike messenger and made money on the side
taking the lsats for people .
oh , wait , i &apos;m confused .
why would he have to resort to that
if he were a college graduate ?
because he wasn &apos;t a college graduate .
what ?
you mean he never graduated from college ?
no , he was kicked out of college for cheating on a test .
well , isn &apos;t it possible
that while he was living with you ,
he went back to school and completed his degree ?
well , i don &apos;t see how , since most of his spare time
was spent sitting around smoking weed with me .
well , let me get this straight .
before he was employed at pearson specter ,
to the best of your knowledge , he worked as
a bike messenger and a part @-@ time lsat imposter ?
yes .
one last question , mr. evans .
is it at all possible that mike ross
ever attended harvard law school ?
not unless they had a satellite campus at
5307 huntington boulevard in brooklyn .
no more questions , your honor .
given that you smoked all this pot , mr. evans ,
isn &apos;t it possible that if mike ross commuted one day
a week to harvard law that you might not remember that ?
i &apos;d remember .
yeah , maybe you would , but you &apos;d lie
through your teeth about it anyway , wouldn &apos;t you ?
objection .
mr. evans , isn &apos;t it true that you &apos;re a long @-@ time
drug dealer and your testimony today is only happening
because you signed a deal with ms. gibbs giving you immunity ?
doesn &apos;t mean i &apos;m lying .
because you wouldn &apos;t lie
just to get out of going to prison ?
no , i would not .
well , how about if the other reason was to get back
at someone you &apos;ve been jealous of your entire life ?
i &apos;ve never been jealous of mike ross in my entire life .
and i just caught you in a lie .
objection , your honor .
mr. evans , my next move is gonna be to call
jenny griffith to the stand ,
and she &apos;s gonna testify that you lied to her for years
about dealing , and when she found out about it ,
she left you for mike ross .
objection . badgering .
she &apos;s also gonna say that you were jealous of his mind
your entire life , and when you found out
that she left you for him , you were as jealous
as a human being can be .
now , is that true or not ?
your honor .
let me rephrase .
is ms. griffith going to be perjuring herself or are you ?
yeah , i was jealous of him .
and if he lied about all of that , what &apos;s to make us believe
that he wasn &apos;t lying about everything else ?
no further questions , your honor .
your honor , prosecution calls donna paulsen to the stand .
don &apos;t worry , donna .
she won &apos;t ask you point @-@ blank if you knew mike was a fraud .
what if she does ?
if you lie ,
they &apos;ll never know .
ms. paulsen , it &apos;s my understanding that you arranged
mr. specter &apos;s interviews for the position currently filled
by michael ross .
is that correct ?
i assisted in the process , yes .
did you find it suspicious that mr. ross
wasn &apos;t listed on the harvard class ranking from his first year ?
no , i didn &apos;t .
and why is that ?
because i &apos;ve never been on any class ranking ,
and i &apos;m the best legal secretary in the city .
wow , that &apos;s a quippy response , ms. paulsen .
but if you were so good at your job , how would you
allow someone who wasn &apos;t even on the interview list
to get in a room alone with harvey specter ?
i &apos;m sure you &apos;ll recognize this list .
after all , you typed it up .
and it looks like his name isn &apos;t on this one either .
no , he wasn &apos;t on the list , but he was smart enough
to talk to his way in ,
which is what a good lawyer does and exactly
what i was looking for .
how exactly did he talk his way in ?
answer the question , ms. paulsen .
he took someone else &apos;s spot .
you mean he said he was someone else .
you &apos;re under oath , ms. paulsen .
may i remind you that perjury carries a sentence
of up to five years ?
did he say he was someone else ?
he said he was rick sorkin .
ha .
so your first introduction to mr. ross was as an imposter ?
i didn &apos;t say that .
you said he lied about what his name was .
that makes him an imposter .
are you going to recant your testimony ?
don &apos;t look at him .
no , i &apos;m not recanting .
all right .
so now we &apos;ve established that mr. ross is a liar .
and now we &apos;re gonna find out if you &apos;re a liar .
so , ms. paulsen ,
to the best of your knowledge ,
did mike ross go to harvard law school or not ?
i &apos;d like to assert my fifth amendment right .
don &apos;t feel bad , ms. paulsen .
i &apos;m sure others will do the same thing too ...
because ...
the defense cannot produce one person
who can place mike ross at harvard law .
the witness could be excused , your honor .
i think we &apos;ve heard all we need to hear .
defense would like to call jimmy kirkwood to the stand .
objection .
his name was not on the witness list .
rebuttal witness .
she just said we can &apos;t produce someone who places
mike at harvard , and i say we can .
your honor--
mr. specter is within his rights .
mr. kirkwood can take the stand .
how did you know he &apos;d testify ?
i didn &apos;t until just now .
well , when i first met mike , i thought ,
&quot; who is this asshole
&quot; who only ever shows up for tests ? &quot;
cockiest son of a bitch i ever saw .
but then i really got to know mike when we were arguing
over an ethics question in professor gerard &apos;s class .
should a lawyer who &apos;s crossed a line
be given a second chance ?
i didn &apos;t think so , but mike did ,
and that &apos;s when i realized that mike ross has more integrity
and compassion in his little finger
than any other lawyer i &apos;ve ever met .
and if i was on trial for my life ,
there &apos;s no one i &apos;d rather have on my side
than my fellow harvard alum mike ross .
just so we &apos;re 100 % clear ,
was mike ross a student at harvard law school with you ?
yes , he was .
no further questions , your honor .
now we &apos;ve heard enough .
ms. gibbs , i &apos;ll give you 24 hours to prepare for cross .
oh , i don &apos;t need 24 hours , your honor .
mr. kirkwood , isn &apos;t it true that two days ago ,
mr. ross contacted you on the street outside of your office
and the two of you got into a heated argument ?
i have the pictures . would you like to see them ?
yes , it &apos;s true .
and isn &apos;t it also true that mike ross
got your aunt a large settlement several months ago ,
and if he gets convicted , it &apos;s likely
that that settlement gets overturned ?
objection . calls for speculation .
he &apos;s a harvard lawyer . he &apos;s qualified to speculate .
overruled .
no , you &apos;re right .
it &apos;d probably get overturned ,
but if you think that &apos;s why i said what i said ,
then obviously you don &apos;t know me .
so trevor evans could lie because he &apos;s jealous ,
but you wouldn &apos;t lie for your aunt ?
i &apos;m not lying for my aunt .
but you are lying , because a person
who &apos;s telling the truth wouldn &apos;t say they &apos;re lying at all .
objection . testifying .
you honor , i &apos;ve had enough of this witness .
he &apos;s excused .
and the prosecution rests .
donna .
come in .
what can i do for you ?
i &apos;m actually here to see mike .
mike &apos;s not here .
he went to go and see harvey .
look , is this about--
it is about today .
donna , i--
you know , i always talk like nothing can get to me .
well , it did today .
i crumbled up there , and i hurt mike &apos;s case .
and i &apos;m ashamed of myself , and i don &apos;t know what to do .
okay .
here &apos;s what you &apos;re gonna do . it &apos;s okay .
you are going to sit down with me
and have a glass of wine
and relax .
because juries aren &apos;t stupid , and they aren &apos;t allowed
to infer anything from what you said , so they won &apos;t .
harvey , i got to tell you , i think we got &apos; em .
mike , sit down .
what &apos;s going on ?
we had a good day , but it wasn &apos;t enough .
what are you talking about ?
jimmy came through .
mike--
look , i know she landed a punch with him .
and i &apos;m telling you , he wasn &apos;t enough .
harvey , all we need is reasonable doubt .
and if i was on that jury , i wouldn &apos;t have it .
i &apos;d find you guilty .
that &apos;s great . so you just called me over here
to make me want to kill myself ?
i called you here because this is not about doubt .
we need to give them a reason to want to let you go .
and how exactly are we gonna do that ?
by doing what you wanted to do in the first place .
no . now ?
are you kidding me ?
it &apos;s the only way to get you to testify
without taking the stand .
and you said if we had to , we &apos;d put me on the stand .
and you were right .
she &apos;s too good at crossing .
well , it &apos;s a great idea , harvey ; i wish i &apos;d had it .
the only problem is , they &apos;re not gonna let me change
my goddamn lawyer in the middle of a trial !
and i &apos;m telling you we need to figure out
a way to make them .
because if we don &apos;t ...
we &apos;re gonna lose .
you &apos;re not allowed to talk to me .
that &apos;s true ,
but if you don &apos;t tell anyone , then no one &apos;s gonna know ,
and i don &apos;t think you &apos;re gonna want to tell anyone .
okay . what do you want ?
i have to admit that until you got rid of sheila ,
i honestly thought you weren &apos;t part of this whole thing ,
but then i did a little checking ,
and i think i can pinpoint the exact day
you found out about mike ross .
i &apos;m calling jessica .
they let you resign , you found out about mike ,
and you used it to return as a name partner .
and you know what that makes me think about you ?
you &apos;re resourceful , maybe a little sleazy ,
but you didn &apos;t hire that kid in the first place .
i &apos;m not turning on my partners .
you had to blackmail them to get what you deserve .
that &apos;s got to stick in your craw .
go .
i will go , louis .
but you know what else i found out
when i was looking into you ?
you like the ballet .
you like to go mudding .
you enjoy the creature comforts in life ,
but they don &apos;t have comforts like that in prison .
they &apos;re gonna lose this trial .
you know it , i know it , and they know it .
you have one last chance to save yourself .
think about it .
and , uh ...
call me .
before it &apos;s too late .
