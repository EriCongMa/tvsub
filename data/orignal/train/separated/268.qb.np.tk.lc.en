well , you , me , and the cupcakes are ready ,
now , we just need people .
ooh , here we go !
this one looks like she might come in .
yeah , keep walking , ugly !
ugly ? she &apos;s like a supermodel .
did she come in and buy something ?
no .
then , she ugly .
okay , yes , business is slow ,
but we don &apos;t have to drop to that level .
ooh , this guy is definitely coming in .
keep walking , fatty !
and he ugly .
welcome to max &apos;s homemade cupcakes !
hello . how much are your cupcakes ?
$ 4 .
no .
whore .
jinx , you owe me a coke !
we both called an old lady a whore .
i know ! we are in complete sync .
that is so good for business .
i &apos;ll give you $ 3 .
i &apos;m sorry , they &apos;re $ 4 .
there &apos;s no one in here . you &apos;ll take what you get .
i &apos;m in love with that whore .
hello . i &apos;m calling from max &apos;s homemade cupcakes
to acquaint you with our new &quot; mornings with max &apos;s &quot; special .
no , sir , that is not what our special is .
and i haven &apos;t even done that with my boyfriend yet ,
so don &apos;t be rude .
give me that phone .
ya fat , ya ugly , ya fugly .
max , we have got to get more business going .
the money sophie gave us to open the shop
will only cover next month &apos;s rent .
wait , we already have next month &apos;s rent ?
why are we worried ?
we &apos;re doing better than everyone else in america .
well , well , well , if it isn &apos;t prince charming .
but , earl , is prince charming ,
or is he just a diva in purple ?
so psyched . finally got a personalized hello from earl .
he called me prince charming .
i &apos;m in , baby , i am in .
i wouldn &apos;t get too excited .
he probably just forgot your name .
he calls every puerto rican guy that comes in here &quot; la bamba . &quot;
max &apos;s homemade cupcakes .
yes , i &apos;ll hold .
of course we do sugar @-@ free and gluten @-@ free .
i &apos;ll be right back , i just gotta take this call .
i understand , but , like , how diabetic ?
i feel a little sick to my stomach .
why ? you haven &apos;t even eaten here yet .
no , i &apos;m nervous .
i came here to tell caroline something kind of big .
what ? you have a secret family on long island ?
no. you have hep @-@ c ? &quot; d &quot; ?
one of the new heps ?
no .
i don &apos;t have any of the heps .
now , telling her i &apos;m in love with her
is just going to sound boring .
you &apos;re gonna tell her you love her ?
here in the diner ?
why , was the dump closed ?
hey , we need more coffee , la bamba .
andy , this isn &apos;t where you tell someone &quot; i love you . &quot;
this is where you tell someone their sex change looks passable .
what &apos;s the big deal ?
if i feel it , why shouldn &apos;t i say it ?
i think she &apos;d be all over that .
nope . if it didn &apos;t happen to kate hudson
in some stupid romantic comedy ,
then it won &apos;t work for caroline .
sorry , what ?
i left and went into another theater in my mind
while you were talking .
i know , it &apos;s so creepy , but she likes it .
really , if you could arrange for it to rain ,
or run after her to the airport in the rain ,
but somehow end up on top of the empire state building
on valentine &apos;s day , that &apos;d be best .
well , i just sold three dozen cupcakes ,
we just have to mark &quot; no sugar &quot; on one of the boxes .
so what did you want to say to me ?
no , nothing , just came by to say hi .
i gotta go download a couple movies .
hey , oleg . where &apos;s my food ?
cheeseburger with fries , pick @-@ up .
han , you look so tall in the window .
tell me the truth , are you standing on another tiny person ?
no .
on the box .
oleg had to leave .
sophie came back from her trip to poland ,
and he &apos;s worried , &apos; cause she &apos;s very , very depressed .
why , did she see you in that hair net ?
come on , listen , when sophie went to see her new house ,
there was no house .
her polish contractor ripped off her money .
poor sophie . i feel terrible .
i know what it feels like to be ripped off .
i once bought a fendi purse , but when i looked inside ,
it said &quot; rendi . &quot;
what kind of god would let that happen ?
max , i went to a party with that .
we should stop by after work , see how she is ,
and bring her some of her favorite cupcakes .
or you could give her that $ 20,000 she loaned you .
loaned us ? sophie gave us that money as a gift .
not what i hear . pick @-@ up !
and we &apos;re out of spaghetti . there &apos;s no sauce .
no , han , there &apos;s plenty of sauce .
i know , but i can &apos;t reach the shelf .
hey , are we sure that money sophie gave us was a gift ?
yes . she gave it to us to support our dream .
i know when i had money , i gave it out freely ,
and never expected anything in return .
like when i gave my maid that gorgeous rendi .
well , i don &apos;t know about people not expecting stuff back .
one time , a guy bought me a slushy ,
and for the next three weeks , he owned me .
no , he really owned me .
eight days in , i almost got traded to a trucker .
and i wouldn &apos;t even mention her gift .
it will only insult her , and i promise ,
nobody is expecting us to give the money back .
come in , girls . did you bring the check ?
no , because it was a gift @-@ a big @-@ ass gift ,
but we brought our love and we brought cupcakes .
well , i doubt she &apos;ll eat them .
she hasn &apos;t even touched her kapusniak ,
which is the dish traditionally served to polish women
who have been wronged by their contractors .
such a specific culture .
but that &apos;s not the worst thing .
she is so depressed , no sex ,
which is big problem for me ,
because i find depressed women very hot .
a lot of guys do .
why do you think i haven &apos;t paid for a drink in six years ?
i &apos;ll go in and tell her you &apos;re here .
she &apos;s just lying there on the bed , lifeless , hot ...
lifeless , hot ...
the big tease .
sophie , the two girls who you loaned the money to
are here to see you .
it was a gift .
a generous , generous gift , but still a gift .
are we sure about that ?
&apos;cause i was slushy boy &apos;s bitch for three weeks ,
and i did things .
look , max brought you cupcakes ,
your favorite : vanilla with a bacon fat drizzle .
no , i can &apos;t eat when i &apos;ve been betrayed .
what kind again ?
sophie , i am patient man ,
but i am also horny man .
any idea when you will snap out of this ?
oh , why don &apos;t you just unzip and climb on top of me now
and get it over with ?
oh , no .
well , we should be going .
no , girls , stay .
if she &apos;s not even going to put up a fight , what &apos;s the fun ?
are you sure ?
bacon drizzle , little bit of heaven .
no , i don &apos;t want them .
okay , let &apos;s put the cupcakes here ,
in case you change your mind .
is this a gun ?
yes . i &apos;m not going to stab myself to death .
do you know how much this outfit costs ?
sophie , you &apos;re going to get through this .
and by the way , you look amazing in black .
oh , well , no more bright colors for me now .
i &apos;m in mourning .
see ? black bra , black garters ,
and look , black panties .
um , you &apos;re not wearing any panties .
i &apos;m not ?
i &apos;m sorry about that wild mess down there .
sophie , i feel bad you got ripped off .
here are all my tips from tonight : $ 27 .
for eight hours ?
oh , now , i &apos;m depressed for you .
you want to borrow my gun ?
you know what ? i think you just need to eat something ,
and pretty soon , you &apos;ll be back to your old self :
a woman who gives gifts and expects nothing in return ,
&apos;cause that &apos;s what a gift is .
sophie , is that doing anything for you ?
yeah , well , i &apos;m not hating it .
here , this soup smells amazing .
oh , no . i don &apos;t have the energy to eat .
sophie , open your mouth and put this in .
oh , come on . now you &apos;re as bad as oleg .
there . better ?
that &apos;s cold .
sophie , just say the word , and i will rob a bank for you .
sophie , i understand you &apos;re hurting ,
but we &apos;ve already spent most of the money on the shop ,
and business just isn &apos;t good .
it &apos;s not the money .
everybody thinks it &apos;s the money .
it &apos;s more than that .
my lake house was my dream , and i lost my dream .
oh , thank god !
well , i &apos;m glad that &apos;s cleared up .
not about the money .
max , come on , she &apos;s had a shock ,
we should let her sleep .
you girls are so lucky . you still have your dream .
well , sophie , what if you were part of our dream ?
i &apos;m sorry ? whose dream ?
our dream .
your dream ? where &apos;s that cupcake ?
look , sophie &apos;s the only reason we have a shop .
we should make her , like , a partner .
partner !
but you and i are already partners .
i feel like we &apos;re kind of partnered out .
what about a silent partner ?
silent partner ! yeah , i like that .
i &apos;m getting my appetite back ,
and also , my sex drive .
go or stay , girls . either way , i &apos;m going in .
i &apos;m sorry i said sophie could be part of the store .
i just felt bad for her ,
lying there , all in black ,
too sad to even make her junk pretty .
it &apos;s fine .
&quot; silent partner &quot; is just a figurehead role anyway ,
and it &apos;s nice to know you have such a big heart .
it &apos;s not my heart .
what i saw down there changed me .
it looks like something an animal built
to live in for the winter .
wait , what is sophie &apos;s chandelier doing here ?
is this the polish version of a home invasion ?
they break in and leave something tacky ?
good morning , partners .
i didn &apos;t know the dress code , so i went business casual .
look , the chandelier that i bought for my lake house .
oh , now our dreams are together .
sophie , it &apos;s not the look we were going for .
oh , i know . much better , right ?
that is definitely not our style .
it looks like a tim burton movie just spit up in here .
i think it &apos;s kind of pretty .
but what do i know ?
i once spent my last 50 bucks on a frog pinata .
had to have it .
max &apos;s homemade cupcakes .
yes , we &apos;re an upscale bakery , and--
now , we sell hoagies .
oh , no , no , no , sir , we do not sell hoagies .
yes , we do .
how many would you like ? let me get a pen .
what &apos;s happening ?
are we finally gonna trash caroline ?
no , i need your help .
i watched four chick flicks back @-@ to @-@ back ,
then i made a list of possible ways
to tell caroline i love her .
i was gonna make more , but i got my period .
okay , run the choices past me .
whichever one makes me want to hurl the most ,
that &apos;s your winner .
i could play a song for her outside of her apartment ,
but keep in mind how hard it is to find a boom box in 2012 .
yeah , plus , if you do that outside our apartment ,
you &apos;ll be shot .
by me .
okay , what about sharing cocoa and a hot dog
on the ice rink in central park ?
yup , that &apos;s it .
makes me want to take my head off
and throw it into the street .
cool . oh , and , max ,
i think i &apos;m the only straight guy on earth
who knows the difference between dylan mcdermott and
dermott mulroney ,
德蒙特 · 莫罗尼 电影男演员 两者外形与类型十分相似
and that , my friend , is love .
oh , what &apos;s that funky @-@ ass smell ?
do they finally sell pepperoni febreze ?
max , this already isn &apos;t working .
the stinky salami , the gaudy chandelier ?
it &apos;s like a haunted quiznos in here .
hey , i &apos;m sending oleg to queens
to pick up a flat of fresca . yeah .
there &apos;s nothing better with a hoagie
than an ice @-@ cold fresca .
that &apos;s what i wanted !
look ...
they &apos;ll go great with the pickled eggs !
this just went from my dream to a nightmare .
oh , my god , caroline ! it is you !
stacy , no way ! i haven &apos;t seen you since graduation .
we went to wharton together .
this girl is a genius .
always top of the class .
so what are you doing here ?
buying a cupcake on your way to running the world ?
no , i own this shop .
you own this little cupcake shop ?
and many other bigger shops .
this is our new williamsburg location .
and yes , i know , the chandelier is all wrong .
i told the designer , none of our pacific northwest locations
will have the chandeliers .
of course , you &apos;d own a cupcake empire at 25 .
oh , and this is max .
hi .
i just transferred from our boise location .
what &apos;s that horrible smell ?
it &apos;s something called a &quot; hoagie . &quot;
the workers like them . right , max ?
si , gracias por la hoagie .
well , i have to go .
i &apos;m consulting upstairs at bbd &amp; l.
oh , upstairs .
yeah .
always knew you &apos;d land on your feet .
let &apos;s go for drinks , and you &apos;re paying , mogul .
i hope she likes water .
now what am i going to do ? stacy &apos;s in the building .
well , you could move to narnia and run that branch ,
you pathological liar .
max , this is not how i want people to see me ,
or smell me , quite frankly .
we have to get rid of the salami , the chandelier ,
and the sophie .
this is our dream , not hers .
okay , fine , i &apos;ll tell her .
hey , sophie , can we talk to you ?
good news , girls .
now we sell scratchers .
but i have even a better idea .
you two should dress up as big cupcakes
and pass out free samples .
sophie , max has something she wants to say to you .
wait .
girls , i have something to say first .
two days ago , i was on the verge of suicide .
yeah , seriously , i hadn &apos;t eaten all afternoon .
but your generosity with your dream
has given me a reason to get up and get a wax .
yeah .
max , there was something you wanted to say ?
i was going to say--
you look delicious .
i look like honey boo boo &apos;s mom at the prom .
this is so humiliating .
now i know how tyra felt
when she went undercover as that fat person .
please tell me this is our bottom .
well , it &apos;s your bottom .
i went to happy hour once
and woke up naked in the penguin habitat
at the bronx zoo .
and i did things .
hey , girls .
what are you two doing just standing there ?
god gave cupcakes legs for a reason .
you need to hit the streets ,
shake your cake maker , and show people your goods .
hey , don &apos;t look at me , it &apos;s vanilla .
i was looking forward to going up
to complete strangers on the street
and saying &quot; eat me , &quot; but she won &apos;t leave .
well , if you &apos;re not going to go out and get the customers ,
then i &apos;ll have to bring the customers to you .
i gotta do everything around here .
seriously , i can &apos;t believe we &apos;re just standing here
when we could be chasing fat people down the street ,
yelling , &quot; you ate my brother ! &quot;
look at you two .
what i wouldn &apos;t give for a giant glass of milk .
look at you , though .
you look so cute .
no , don &apos;t look at me .
i &apos;m totally embarrassed in this thing .
yes , she &apos;s cute and embarrassed ,
in a larger @-@ than @-@ life , colorful , public setting .
ah , right .
so , caroline , listen , i wanted to--
look , girls , some young professionals .
oh , my god ! she &apos;s bringing stacy .
she can &apos;t see me in this .
i was her valedictorian . take this .
wait .
help me up , max ! help me up !
oh , great . now you &apos;re like my mom .
here , give me your left hand .
okay , give me your right hand .
get up ! get up ! five second rule .
what are you two crazy cakes doing ?
you lost your customers . they ran away .
oh , thank god .
oh , i don &apos;t get it .
you won &apos;t push the hoagies or the pickled eggs .
you must really have a fear of success .
well , at least we missed stacy .
well , you know what else you missed ? andy .
he was about to tell you he loves you .
what ?
just now , in the hall , and at the ice rink .
he &apos;s been trying to tell you all week .
but i &apos;ve been too preoccupied with work ,
like sandra bullock in the proposal .
so he was gonna tell me at the ice rink ?
the one in central park ?
yes , while having cocoa and splitting a hot dog .
oh , my god !
that &apos;s , like , my dream &quot; i love you &quot; scenario .
why didn &apos;t you tell me sooner ?
because when it comes to other people &apos;s creepy love stuff ,
that &apos;s when i &apos;m a silent partner ,
and you need to stop with this creepy rom @-@ com stuff .
life isn &apos;t like a movie .
sometimes you &apos;re not a success right away ,
sometimes you have to just eat it and be a cupcake ,
and sometimes you have to take your &quot; i love you &quot;
whichever way it comes .
you are so right .
i don &apos;t have to wait for the moment to be perfect ,
like it was for reese witherspoon in sweet home alabama .
my life &apos;s not a romantic comedy .
i can do it my own way .
like julia roberts in my best friend &apos;s wedding .
andy , it &apos;s me !
i &apos;ll be right out .
no , this can &apos;t wait any longer .
i don &apos;t need a big romantic comedy moment .
no--
oh , sorry . i thought it was the office !
not the office .
i &apos;m stuck .
oh , i want to go , but i can &apos;t .
and i &apos;ll never be able to go again .
well , i &apos;m on the toilet and you &apos;re in a cupcake .
can &apos;t get creepier than this , so ,
caroline , i love you .
i love you too .
oh , please , push me out .
how &apos;d it go ? was it romantic ?
he told me he loved me on the toilet .
oh , man ! that &apos;s my dream scenario !
i &apos;m only gonna do this for an hour ,
to show you how it &apos;s done ,
and then i &apos;m out .
this is your dream , not mine .
cupcakes ! free cupcakes !
come on , get &apos; em !
get &apos; em while they &apos;re hot !
