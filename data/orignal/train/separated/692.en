My father was an innocent man,
destroyed by powerful people.
The Graysons are behind this, and they're gonna pay.
I've dedicated my life to avenging his death...
Eventually, someone's gonna find you out.
And I won't stop until they've all paid the price.
I've been collecting names of Grayson Global employees.
One of them will be willing to share their account.
Thanks for meeting with me, Ms. Davis.
It's Lydia.
I'm not gonna help you break up their engagement.
Regret will haunt you, if you let Daniel go.
I want to tell you my plan for August 8th--
The day Victoria goes down for the murder
of Emily Thorne.
I'm not asking you to commit to anything.
I just can't commit to Emily,
not when I feel this way about you.
I went to the doctor.
Are you okay?
We're pregnant.
When facing your enemy,
no amount of training can trump nature.
It separates the strong from the weak.
And sometimes it tell us
that surrender is the strongest move of all.
Let her go.
Right there. Very nice.
Big smiles.
Yeah, that's nice, looking at each other.
Beautiful.
Closer.
Right behind her.
Very nice.
Lovely.
We got it!
All right. Next, is the Di Santo,
which we'll be shooting at the stables in 30.
That Lhuillier fits you impeccably, Emily--
like it was made for you.
Well, all of the dresses have been beautiful today so far.
Only 48 hours until the world gets to see
the perfect one you've chosen for your big day.
Now aren't there some questions you should be asking
instead of just gushing over my fiance, Jess?
Of course.
So tell me, boss,
how does a man like Daniel Grayson
take a back seat in all the nuptial preparations?
By admitting I don't know the first thing
about planning a wedding.
Oh, he's being modest.
Daniel actually selected the color scheme, the venue...
the cake.
And what are your plans for the days that follow?
Where will you be residing, for instance?
Or when will you be needing a nursery?
Well--
The wedding's been our main focus.
One thing at a time. All right?
We'll be right out.
I don't know how long I can keep our little secret.
Not that I want to tell a journalist before your parents.
Well, let's just keep it quiet until after the wedding.
I don't want it to overshadow your day.
Besides, I thought you preferred to avoid all this publicity.
I don't know. For some reason, I'm just bursting to tell the world.
Mm. Well, the truth is,
"Voulez" has put so much into this article
that changing it now would...
throw the issue into chaos.
And we can't take that risk.
Emily, I need you in that Di Santo, Please.
Hopefully,
these new accommodations will suit your tastes.
Anything would be better than that motel you caged me in.
I've had handbags bigger than that room.
And where's my per diem?
Just call room service.
I'm not talking carbs.
I'm talking Cartier.
I've told you, you're not to go out in public.
I need to protect my source until my story is finished.
Your story?
You'd still be asking useless questions about Nolan Ross
if I hadn't reached out.
And I'll be grateful if there is, in fact, truth
to the conspiracy theory that David Clarke was framed.
But without telling me who was behind it
and finding me someone who can corroborate your claim,
our story is nothing but a common myth,
and I won't print that.
I'll need a list of people who can back you up,
and their connection to what happened.
No good ever comes from dredging up the past--
especially ours.
Well, as difficult as it may be
for either of us to remember, my dear,
we had some good times.
Oh, that would call into question your definition of "Good."
As you can see, in lieu of a proper muse,
I'm forced to turn to photographs
to rouse my recollection for my memoirs.
Do you care to take a trip with me down memory lane?
Oh, my goodness,
look how beautiful and innocent he was.
Had we even settled on a name yet?
No.
Daniel was still "Baby boy Grayson."
And now he's marrying that charlatan.
Oh... this again.
Listen, after your little stunt at Emily's bridal luncheon,
you are one loosely veiled speech away from the looney bin.
Reel it in, Victoria.
I was showing him the truth.
Just let him be.
Your other son became a murderer after only six months with you.
You know, the time has come for you to stop this foolish interfering.
Trust me.
I have every confidence
that with his heart yearning for another,
our baby boy will put an end to Emily himself.
婚礼主题
Oh, so being busy at work isn't just an excuse?
Look...
Sara, I'm not avoiding you, okay? It's just--
It's been a week.
You know, every day I wear this, I feel worse.
If you're not ready to leave Emily, then...
I'm not gonna wait around. Okay, I'm not that girl.
I'm not asking you to be.
It's just things with Emily are a little...
They're a little more complicated than you know.
Yeah, well, it looks picture-perfect to me.
This is all just show, okay? It's...
"Voulez's" start has been less than ideal.
And a spread like this sells magazines, which I need.
Yeah, well, I need to stop feeling like the other woman.
So make up your damn mind.
Sara, come...
Sara.
There's the blushing bride.
I would offer you a cocktail, if you weren't with child.
Has the package arrived yet?
No, not till tomorrow.
What's wrong?
Daniel's wavering. He's been distant all week.
The baby boom didn't knock him off the fence,
back into your arms?
Unfortunately, no.
He's still in contact with Sara.
I think he's keeping the pregnancy a secret
so she doesn't leave him.
That's the whole reason you played that card
in the first place.
So...
Leak the story.
He'll know it was me.
And I can't risk losing his trust again.
You also can't risk losing him to Sara.
Maybe it's time we start using more drastic measures.
Not yet.
I'm meeting with Victoria tonight
to finalize the seating arrangements.
I guess I'll...
figure out a way to deal with it then.
Did you get what I asked for?
Are you sure about this?
It's not part of her plan.
Yes, I'm sure.
Thank you.
It looks good, Ross.
Now I just need one more thing--
Your advice.
Well, now where to seat Mr. Ross?
Hmm. I would say with your other friends,
but you don't seem to have any.
I'd like to find a place for Nolan at the main table,
seeing as he is walking me down the aisle.
Oh, none for me, thanks.
Oh, don't tell me that you've suddenly become
a bride obsessed with her figure.
The wedding is less than two days away, my dear.
The damage is already done.
No, nothing like that.
You know, Emily, you surprise me.
After learning her fiancé was in the arms of another,
most self-respecting women would call things off.
And many wives would leave their husbands,
and yet, here we are.
Am I to assume that you addressed this with Daniel?
Daniel is going to be my husband
and the father of my children.
I'll address it the way I see fit.
Your ignoring the problem will only make matters worse.
I can assure you.
Victoria?
What the hell?
Lydia?
Don't just stand there. Zip me up.
What in the hell are you doing here?
Giving your wardrobe some much-needed editing.
You all right, dear?
You look like you've seen a ghost.
Well, you've certainly proved resilient before, Lydia.
I don't know why I should be surprised.
I take it you saved her.
I'm beginning to question the wisdom of my mercy.
Emily, would you please excuse us?
Not only is the man of the house absent,
but his clothes are noticeably missing from his closets.
Do I detect trouble in paradise?
We had a deal. You were never to come out of hiding.
Neither were you.
I should have known better than to trust the ice queen.
When I bartered the evidence against Conrad
for Charlotte's safety and was forced to exit that plane,
I didn't have to take you with me, Lydia.
You owe me your life.
Some life.
I'm slinging drinks for honeymooners in Ecuador,
while you're the first lady of New York?
You didn't save me. You got rid of me.
I did disappear.
But my children were menaced again,
and I had no choice.
And after the hell Conrad put me through,
I regret ever having left that plane.
Because of him,
I've become just as much a prisoner of these walls.
Maybe we should switch.
If it's retribution you're seeking,
perhaps you've forgotten who's to blame.
Oh, Victoria.
Still so damn good at pointing that finger of yours.
I'm well aware that Conrad owes me big.
Keep my little drop-in between us...
and maybe I'll go easy on you.
Low returns like these are expected early
in a publication's life.
It took three years for my father
to turn a profit with European "Voulez."
We'll do it in one.
Oh, I have a few surprises up my sleeve, Mr. Sullivan.
I assure you, you won't be disappointed.
Okay, I must go. Thank you. Merci.
So this Mr. Sullivan is the reason you keep canceling on me?
What's he got that I don't?
He buys 16 pages of advertising per issue.
Sure, but can he do this?
Probably.
Just not as well.
That's what I thought.
What's in the bag, Romeo?
Well, three rescheduled dinners worth of food.
I hope you're hungry.
I'm sorry. Last week's been crazy.
Yeah. That's okay.
What is it?
Nothing. I just thought the Stowaway
had a messy filing system.
It's lucky you have an excellent chef, Mr. Porter,
or I'd call Mr. Sullivan back.
Great music.
Thanks.
Charlotte?
Hey, um... can we talk?
Yeah, of course. What's up?
Listen, uh...
I really appreciate everything you've done for me.
But... things aren't working out.
Tell Jack I'm sorry.
Is this because of Daniel?
Am I that obvious?
I still love him, Charlotte.
I know he's getting married in two days.
You're the maid of honor,
and you probably think I'm awful. I--
I don't even know what I'm saying.
I was trying to quit.
And I'm not gonna let you.
I've always thought you two belonged together.
Maybe daniel just needs a little push.
Oh, trust me.
It's too late. He's already made up his mind.
You let me be the judge of that.
Are you sure?
Daniel, she's upstairs with your mother right now.
Yeah, how is that even possible?
It's really quite a story.
I can't believe it.
And I can't believe you're marrying this one.
So I guess that makes us even.
Can you explain this?
We'll talk about it later.
Oh, don't let me keep you.
As much as I love rehashing the past,
a girl needs her beauty rest.
It was lovely seeing you again, Lydia.
Save it.
They may still be falling for that little act of yours,
but not me.
Oh, Lydia.
I think you've pretty much cornered the market on falling,
don't you think?
Daniel.
Are you all right?
Hey, come here.
Yeah, I'm--I'm sure.
Are you sure? I'm calling the doctor.
Daniel, you're overreacting. She's fine.
Mom, she's pregnant.
Come on. You okay?
Sorry, Victoria.
I didn't want you to find out this way,
but... you're gonna be a grandmother.
What could possibly be so important
as to require my presence in your bedroom?
Well, our son is getting married tomorrow.
And since I have no clue as to what color
my date will be wearing,
I don't know if I should go for the pearl or the bone.
Which would keep us from clashing?
No tie in the world could accomplish that.
The bone.
You missed quite a revelation last night.
Did you dig up another selfless deed from Emily's past?
Another selfish act, rather.
Emily announced that she's with child.
That's marvelous.
Don't be ridiculous.
She's lying.
Why?
To trap Daniel into marrying her one day before their wedding?
I'm thrilled.
And may even lead with happy news
of the next Grayson generation...
when I talk with "Time" Magazine.
Oh, they're interested in you?
must be a slow news year.
Well, there's even talk of a cover.
And when exactly did this invitation present itself?
Oh, just this morning.
Well, I must admit That you definitely earned
what's coming to you.
Lydia Davis was my father's secretary.
She betrayed him for a life in the Hamptons,
So... I took it away from her.
But she didn't go down without a fight.
Five storeyes down, to be exact.
Luckily, her tumble
provided us enough time to tie up a loose end.
Loose end?
She found a photo at a Grayson party.
I was in the background.
Pre-Emily Thorne/ Amanda Clarke--
all brunette bangs and bad attitude.
Nolan fixed it before she could prove anything,
but... she still has it out for me.
What do you think she wants this time?
Whatever a pretty blonde who comes to the Hamptons wants--
revenge.
I wouldn't put it past her.
I need you to find out what she's up to
so we can put a stop to it.
I'm on it.
Uh, any tips?
Gird your loins.
And speaking of-- has Daniel come around
to accepting the fruit of his?
I got him to spill the news of my pregnancy
to Victoria last night.
What's next?
Well, we all know Victoria has a difficult time
keeping secrets.
I have a few phone calls to make.
I had a feeling I'd find you here.
Charlotte, what are you doing here?
You always run this trail when you're stressed.
What are you running from now?
Charlotte, come on.
Talk to me, Daniel.
Everything was good with Emily--
really good.
I mean, I had "Voulez." We were finally getting married.
I was happy. And then...
Sara.
The one girl who could throw me for a loop.
I mean, I love Emily,
but the way I feel when I'm with Sara
makes me question everything.
Then maybe you should.
No, no, no. You don't understand, okay?
You don't-- you don't get it.
Danny, it's me--
If I hadn't run into Sara at the bakery
everything would be fine. But...
It's not. I'm not.
Look, I-I gotta run, okay?
I need to talk to you about something, man.
Your talk with Margaux didn't work.
Even though you-- you threw her off the scent,
she's--she's still digging into Conrad.
Is there way that you can...
take control of her computer
and keep track of what she's writing?
Yes. But it's just a bit complicated.
I'd need her, uh--
Her I.P. address?
I don't know whether to be impressed or terrified.
Trust me, going behind Margaux's back
is the last way I want to handle the situation,
but I can't let her get any deeper.
Then tell her the truth.
And become her biggest source?
She's a journalist, Nolan. She'll follow the story.
You don't know that for sure.
Why don't you let her decide?
Can you help me or not?
Thanks again for coming to Dr. Rosen's with me.
Of course.
Oh, my God! Daniel, look!
How did the press find out we were here?
Emily! Emily! Emily!
This is impossible. We only told your mother.
I can't believe her. Oh, my gosh.
Just put-- just put the top up.
Just go. Just drive.
What the hell is wrong with you?!
I told you we wanted to keep the pregnancy news quiet,
and you leaked it anyway. And for what--
An-another shot at Emily?
I did nothing of the sort.
And what makes you so certain that she wasn't behind it?
Come on. What possible reason could she have?
To make certain that you marry her
And not leave for Sara.
What? What are you talking about?
I know about your night in the pied a Terre.
Oh. Well, I didn't sleep with her,
if that's what you're insinuating.
Not that it's any of your business.
No, it's Emily's.
You told Emily?
You're damn right, I did.
You are marrying one girl,
and you're in love with another, Daniel.
No, you don't know a damn thing about who I love.
I think I do, and so does Emily.
And that's why she trapped you into this pregnancy business.
You've completely lost your mind, you know that?
Listen to me, she is a con artist.
She is-- she is going to be my wife,
whether you like it or not! You know why?
Because she is giving me the opportunity
to raise a child the right way--
in a loving home.
Not with a loveless marriage.
Oh, come on.
Daniel, open your eyes!
Stop!
She has deceived you from day one!
Enough! Enough!
This time tomorrow, Emily and I will be married.
You lost. Okay? It's over.
Hello?
Jake?
Conrad Grayson.
Hope I'm not too early.
You're right on time.
My god.
Lydia?
Hello, Conrad.
Is it really you?
Almost as hard to believe as "Time" magazine
wanting you for a cover.
You know, I always harbored a hope when Victoria survived
that you'd done the same.
Really?
You're the one that let me get on that plane.
I'd be dead if it wasn's momentary lapse of evil.
Well, then I've never been more grateful for her
than I am at this moment.
And you look...
like no time has passed.
I'm not falling for this.
We were engaged, Conrad,
and you sent me to my death.
Lydia, I did everything I could to stop you.
I mean, if memory serves, you conjured
a sick mother to get away from me.
But I take the blame for inspiring such a turn, but--
I find that hard to believe.
Believe what you must.
You obviously thought I'd be set against you
to use this ruse to get me here.
But believe me,
honesty would have worked.
I think you should go.
Why?
Oh, I can see you're not done with me yet.
Trust me, Conrad.
When I'm done with you,
you'll know it.
That should be all for today, Ms. Thorne.
Or should I say Mrs. Greysons?
Not yet, Don. Let's see how tomorrow goes.
Thanks.
Hey, don't stress.
It's gonna be the best day of your life.
Yeah, congratulations, Ms. Thorne.
Is it true?
Hey.
Are you really...
Pregnant?
We wanted to tell you first, but...
I don't care about that.
I'm just so happy for you.
And I promise to be a much better aunt
than maid of honor.
What are you talking about?
I just feel like I haven't been very helpful,
to you or Daniel.
But I want you to know that I have your back.
And if you'll let me, your hands and feet.
Ladies?
Hi. Hi, Ms. Thorne.
What is this?
It's the day before your wedding.
You deserve to be pampered.
So you're getting a mani-pedi.
Thank you, Charlotte. I love it.
Hey, we're sisters. It's the least I can do.
Margaux LeMarchal speaking.
Ms. LeMarchal, this is the concierge desk
at the Stella Hotel.
I'm terribly sorry to bother you,
But... A bottle of krug brut was ordered to your guest's room
by a visitor this afternoon.
A visitor?
Yes. Yes, ma'am.
Would you prefer that charged to your room
or to Mr. Grayson's personal account?
What the hell were you doing?
I wanted him to pay, so I was trying to trap him.
And?
I got nothing.
So you put my entire story at risk?
And for what--a few dresses and a quick accouplement?
He's not the man I remembered.
Are you just playing me to reunite with an old flame?
You're of no use to me if I can't trust you.
Consider our arrangement terminated.
This stays with me.
Oh, you don't have much left to cling to,
do you, Ms. Davis?
The time has come for Victoria to pay
the ultimate price.
And I bring a gift to help you do just that.
Ms. Davis will no longer be a problem.
Turns out she was selling her dirty Grayson secrets
to our resident Lois Lane.
Margaux.
But Lydia couldn't help herself.
I caught her meeting with Conrad.
Old habits.
I alerted Margaux to her shifting allegiance.
But once Margaux's dispensed with her, it won't be long
until Lydia's crawling back to Conrad.
Let her.
It will keep Victoria distracted.
Well, it seems that she's, uh, distracted enough,
if you've already got your fingers on that bracelet.
And I'll slip it back into Victoria's closet
before she ever knows about it.
Once it's covered in gunshot residue, of course.
Yes, I'm calling Mr. Harman please.
Well, do you have a new contact number?
What about a forwarding address?
Nothing. I see. Merci.
I despise people interrupting me when I'm working.
Unless, of course, they have a good reason,
and I've got a doozy.
Does this mean you've reconsidered my proposal?
You wish.
No, I stand steadfast by my statement.
You and everyone else.
Perhaps, as we say in the states,
you are barking up the wrong tree.
Unlike the rest of you,
I'm not so easily dissuaded.
The truth is out there,
and I won't stop until I find it.
Do me one favor--
let me give you a lead.
I hope you haven't written the chapter on me yet.
You may have sweet-talked your way past the help,
but if you are here to exact more punishment,
you've clearly forgotten who I am.
Seeing you, I've remembered how much you mean to me.
And I've come to my senses.
I realize I shouldn't have chosen Victoria over you.
I'll never do that again.
It seems we've both made mistakes.
Then let's call it even.
Shall we?
You weren't lying when you said it was complicated.
I never lied to you.
But you didn't tell me that Emily was pregnant.
I didn't know what to say.
Well, now's your chance.
The moment I saw you in the bakery...
all the feelings I once had came rushing back.
And I fell in love with you again.
Sara, Emily's having my baby.
We both know what a broken home
can do to a kid.
You know, I wish I could tell you that I don't understand,
That you're making a mistake, but I can't.
I'm sorry.
This is the way it is.
We're just not meant to be.
Good-bye, Danny.
Sara.
This family is so predictable.
When threatened,
each Grayson has their own retreat,
like a turtle's shell--
Dad and his den,
you and this cupola.
Daniel's running trail.
Where's yours, Charlotte?
And please don't tell me it's that bar.
I'm hoping it'll be my new apartment.
Once this wedding madness is over,
I'm moving out of the stowaway.
It's time I lead my own life, mom,
just like it's time for Daniel to lead his.
What we did with Sara
hurt them both,
and Daniel was better off without us interfering.
We don't know that.
I do.
I saw the pain he was in because of what we did.
I'm done meddling,
and it's time you stopped, too.
It's tradition for a warrior to have a drink of sake
before going into battle.
Now close your eyes. Focus.
When coming to the end of your journey,
it's important to reflect on the start.
How you've changed,
what you've lost,
and what you've gained.
When you and I first met,
we had both lost so much
and faced immense pain.
But out of that pain came something beautiful...
Love.
A love that will always triumph over darkness.
A love that I would lay down my life for.
Amanda Clarke...
Will you marry me?
Yes.
Our last name is gonna be "Ross"?
Yeah. Nolan insisted we be distant cousins
so that he can, you know, come and see us
without attracting any unwanted attention.
His heart is even bigger than his brain.
I'm gonna miss him.
Well, I'll remind you of that sentiment
when he's crashing on our sofa every other month.
Who is it?
It's Daniel.
I should get going. It's getting late.
Here.
It's just, you know,
one more night,
and then we'll never have to spend another apart.
One more night.
Thank you.
There you are.
I'll take two of whatever you like
and a few minutes to talk.
This is a nice surprise.
What's up?
I had an interesting conversation with Nolan.
Oh, yeah?
What about?
That there is more to Conrad than you're letting on.
I don't know what Nolan said, but, hey--
That was the extent of it, actually.
And that the story I'm so desperate to tell
somehow involves you.
And if I care about you as much as he thinks I do,
I should ask you about it.
So here I am.
Don't be mad at Nolan, Jack.
He just wants what's best for you,
as do I.
Please. What is it?
Conrad Grayson is responsible
for both the death of my wife and my brother.
What?
And the secrets that you were looking to unearth
are the reasons why.
I can't believe that, Jack. I've known him all my life.
I've never--
He's a bad man, Margaux,
and he's brought me a lot of pain.
Well, you could've told me that.
I know you.
You're a fighter.
I thought you'd try to make him pay.
And since I've lost everyone who's ever tried, I...
I didn't want to lose you, too.
Look, I don't want to tell you how to live your life.
But if you keep digging,
you'll put yourself in danger.
It's more than that, Jack.
Telling that story would mean letting you go,
and I'm not willing to do that.
There'll be other stories,
but there is only one Jack Porter.
Well, this is it.
Last chance to skip this silly tradition.
It's not silly. It's nice.
The next time you see me,
I'll be walking the aisle in white.
What is it?
I keep wondering why you're not bringing it up.
My mom said she told you about Sara.
I didn't sleep with her.
Okay? I-I was...
confused and--and scared.
The last thing I wanted to do was to hurt you,
and I am sorry.
Say something, please.
Is it over?
Yes.
Yes. I ended it with her because you're the only one I want.
You're the only one I want, too.
I'm all in.
With you...
and the baby.
I'm not going anywhere.
Me neither.
What's all this?
Ah. This is our vast anthology of event photography.
I had them fetched from storage
to provide some inspiration for my memoirs.
And now that my Muse has returned in the flesh...
My cup runneth over.
Would you mind if I...
No. Reminisce to your heart's content.
For tomorrow,
we begin our future.
Everything's in place.
Daniel's on board.
Lydia's preoccupied.
The evidence is ready.
I think we're all set.
And you're engaged to someone who knows the real you.
Well done, cuz.
Couldn't have done it without you.
I know.
Well, I guess I'm gonna have to get a new hobby.
What are your thoughts on spelunking?
Good night, Nolan.
Good evening, Emily.
Victoria.
To what do I owe this visit?
Another empty gift box? Perhaps one for the baby?
Oh, the time has run out for such frivolity.
Your wedding is tomorrow, and the game is over.
I've washed my hands of it.
Instead, I've found a place at the main table for Nolan Ross.
He's welcome to my spot.
I won't be in attendance.
Congratulations, emily.
