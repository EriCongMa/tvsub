gossip girl here--
your one and only source
into the scandalous lives of manhattan &apos;s elite .
blair , don &apos;t fall off the wagon now .
i haven &apos;t !
it &apos;s just your ordinary , run @-@ of @-@ the @-@ mill ex sex ,
fueled by the most common of aphrodisiacs--
mutual loathing and disdain .
relationships with faculty are strictly forbidden .
when i met you , i was running away from someone .
i &apos;m sorry that i ran right into you .
good luck , serena .
hey , dan , i &apos;ll wait outside for you , for however long it takes .
i really miss you . just give me a second chance .
i won &apos;t let you down .
you tried to destroy my friendship with blair ,
my reputation , my academic career .
you failed every time , and now it &apos;s time for you to go .
a friends of ours thinks that we share mutual enemies
on the upper east side , and , well ,
i could really use some help from the inside right now .
what exactly did you have in mind ?
红豆包 安娜喬 range petty 微笑
on the upper east side , the possibilities are endless .
dom or krug ,
winston or cartier ,
tory or stella ,
eventually , even the people with everything
have to choose .
hey , why are you guys eating ?
i thought we were going to sarabeth &apos;s .
uh , we decided we can spread out better here .
there &apos;s more room to work .
on what ? your calculus homework ?
uh , your love life .
it &apos;s a little something called dan versus nate .
we &apos;re here to help .
and we brought protractors .
a venn diagram ?
really ?
you--you seriously expect me to make this monumental decision
with colored pencils and graph paper ?
don &apos;t mock . elliot got an 800 on his math s.a.t.
mm @-@ hmm . probability , set theory .
it &apos;s , uh , basically what they do
when you join an online dating service .
okay , e &apos;s harmony , i will submit to your method .
but just so you know , i did choose .
i called dan right after i broke up with colin .
and nate showed up and said some things that i couldn &apos;t ignore .
and then ?
well , i ... ignored him ,
ran up to my room , and haven &apos;t spoken to either since .
that &apos;s a familiar coping mechanism .
well ... let &apos;s see how you cope with this .
&#91; 《 纽约邮报 》 娱乐专版 &#93;
&quot; why did colin forrester leave columbia students
eager to learn about the psychology of business ?
answer--his funny business with serena van der woodsen . &quot;
mom , you have to call them
and make them print a retraction and an apology .
you know that &apos;s not true .
half of new york saw you kiss him at the ballet .
dean reuther would like to see us in her office .
well , looks like our compatibility worksheet
will have to wait .
hey , serena , it &apos;s me . uh , i saw your thing in the &quot; post . &quot;
just wanted you to know brooklyn is a great place
to avoid nasty looks ...
unless you throw your recycling in the regular trash
or try to open a giant chain store with questionable labor practices ,
but anyway , call me .
i left her the same message ,
only without the lame brooklyn joke .
but you shouldn &apos;t wait by your phone , man .
well , last i checked , the only thing serena wanted from you
was to make some billionaire jealous .
oh ! you mean the same thing she wanted from you ?
why are you even here ? i assume you &apos;re responsible .
i totally understand if you guys are still mad at me
for what happened with serena ,
but obviously , you miss each other .
i &apos;ll take that awkward pause as a &quot; yes . &quot;
don &apos;t think this means
that i &apos;ve been calling out your name in my sleep .
it &apos;s not like i &apos;ve been writing &quot; mrs. nate humphrey &quot;
in my notebook .
there &apos;s nothing like a friendly benefit
to start a day of meetings about getting the empire back on top .
you do thrive in that position .
i &apos;m sure your black and white ball for the hotel association
will remind everyone of that .
and with your glow , anne archibald will beg you
to be the face of her new foundation .
it &apos;s a hormonal response to orgasm , nothing more .
what else could it be ?
what indeed .
too bad it couldn &apos;t get me an 8 : 00 reservation at the lion .
while i love to delay your gratification ,
i can curb your cravings
if you &apos;d care to join me there tonight before my party .
you have a reservation ? tonight ?
i can tell my business associates something came up .
unless you object .
nothing wrong with a lobster potpie between friends .
i &apos;ll see you at 8 : 00 .
dorota ! i need sam brocato
and an assortment of chloe that &apos;s subtle but sexy .
for your meeting with mrs. archibald ?
no , for my dinner with chuck .
and i see your brain trying to
translate the implications from polish , but there are none .
so stop thinking and do .
delucie , it &apos;s chuck bass . i need a favor .
2 for dinner at 8 : 00 .
i wouldn &apos;t ask , but it &apos;s important .
great .
you can at least try to hide your disappointment .
well , i have nothing to hide .
i simply want to put this behind us .
even if i have to wear a scarlet letter
for something i didn &apos;t do ?
dean reuther , i &apos;m sorry you have to disrupt your day
with such trivial matters .
it &apos;s hardly trivial , mrs. humphrey .
i &apos;m sure you saw the wall of paparazzi at the campus gates .
well , i assure you , none of us is interested
in this kind of media attention .
i hope you &apos;ll let our family make it up to you
with an endowment .
maybe you could use it to build a moat around the school ,
keep out the press .
the only thing i &apos;d like from your family
is to withdraw your daughter from our university .
what ? over a gossip column ?
hundreds of parents have called ,
concerned about teachers .
i &apos;m sorry , serena .
i have to look at the bigger picture .
it &apos;s no longer just your education that &apos;s being disrupted .
well , i &apos;m sure you &apos;ve realized that serena was accepted
at other ivy league institutions .
mom , please .
well , getting out of the city
is probably your best course of action .
we can refund her tuition ,
and i am happy to facilitate a transfer .
i think you misunderstood me .
serena chose columbia .
and despite your judgment , she is the victim here .
and i &apos;m sure &quot; the times &quot; would love to do an article
about a dean who tolerates professors in power positions
exploiting female students .
well , i hope you &apos;ll consider my offer .
i swear , i thought i was over serena
until i realized how much juliet had come between us .
i just felt like we had to try again .
is that what you were telling her after the ballet ?
yeah , until you showed up .
i haven &apos;t heard from her since .
nah , me neither . so , look , you and i are friends ,
and we both like the same girl .
we tried pretending that we didn &apos;t .
but we do .
and we tried to act like we don &apos;t care that we &apos;re friends ...
but we do .
that was good . that was good .
so--so what if we both take our best shot ,
and like the gentlemen we are ,
agree to be okay with whoever she picks ?
what are you trying to say ? let the best man win ?
&apos;cause i just did .
i think dean reuther was actually trembling .
you were very impressive .
i was , wasn &apos;t i ?
thank you for believing me . it means a lot .
well , promise me no more surprises .
you know everything , i swear .
jenny . oh ! that &apos;s the kind of surprise i like .
i wish i could say the same .
i &apos;m gonna say hi to eric and elliot .
well , nice to see you , too , serena .
oh , she &apos;s had a rough day .
i thought you weren &apos;t coming in until the holidays ? oh !
mm . jenny has something she needs to tell you .
uh ... yeah .
this girl , juliet sharp , called me in hudson
and asked for my help to take serena down .
now i know serena still hates me ,
so i might have done something like this last year ,
but not now .
well , serena has filled me in , and luckily ,
juliet &apos;s reign is over now that she &apos;s failed
to get serena kicked out of columbia .
well , i don &apos;t know .
um , she said she was gonna leak a story to page six .
yeah , i @-@ i &apos;m sorry .
if i thought she was serious ,
i would &apos;ve come to you sooner .
um , she also said that she knew more
and she wasn &apos;t afraid to use it .
thank you , jenny . you did the right thing .
and i will take it from here .
okay .
well i know you have to get back to m.o.m.a.
and your abstract expressionism day with mom ,
but it &apos;s been nice having you ,
even for a minute .
thanks , dad .
mmm . bye .
yeah , everything &apos;s in place on my end .
vanessa has the boys set , too .
looks like serena will finally get what she deserves .
well , maybe i miss the upper east side after all .
watch out , s.
looks like brooklyn finally has a team again .
and this time , they brought in a ringer .
it is so nice to see you again , anne .
you , too , blair . you know , even though
things didn &apos;t work out with you and nathaniel ,
i &apos;ve remained impressed with you ,
which is why you were the first person i thought of
to replace me as the face of the girls inc . foundation .
i &apos;d be honored to carry on your philanthropic tradition .
but i feel i need to tell you the board is very focused
on the fact that the head of a female empowerment organization
needs to be someone who &apos;s empowered herself .
well , they &apos;re in luck ,
because power isn &apos;t just my mission ,
it &apos;s my mantra .
it &apos;s more ...
your personal relationships that are in question .
i assume you don &apos;t mean nate .
so i took your advice about the relaunch .
after tonight , it will be clear i &apos;m back in the game
with victrola , gimlet , and the empire as my flagship .
yeah , but a black and white ball ?
it &apos;s so hilton--
conrad , not paris .
i take your insult as flattering .
well , don &apos;t .
people aren &apos;t checking into the empire
for a black @-@ tie experience .
they come to live like chuck bass--
no rules , no repercussions .
they still can . the hotel is the same as ever .
but you aren &apos;t .
when you disappeared ,
you seriously damaged your brand ,
and the hotel has paid the price .
people do change .
not that i know if chuck has ,
since i rarely associate with him anymore .
so what do you suggest ?
if you want to rebuild , you need to commit to being
the hedonist everyone loves to hate .
no one wants a soft @-@ hearted has @-@ been
who &apos;s worried about dating blair waldorf .
trust me , a relationship with blair
is the furthest thing from my mind .
people may forgive the choices you &apos;ve made in your past .
but if you want this foundation in your future ,
i &apos;ll need some assurance that charles won &apos;t be a part of it .
he &apos;s not even part of my present .
you were right .
lily has requested a meeting .
trust me , nothing drives a wedge
between mother and daughter
more than lily trying to cover up for serena .
why hide your talents in hudson ?
i didn &apos;t wanna cross any more lines
trying to defend myself against blair . but ...
when you told me they went after vanessa at the ballet ,
i had to help .
blair &apos;s pathological for sure ,
but half of what she does is to protect serena .
and she never pays consequences
or takes responsibility .
which is exactly why we need to
turn everyone against serena ,
so she finally knows what it feels like to be an outsider .
well , i &apos;d say you &apos;re pretty expert at this yourself .
i just like visual aides .
uh , nate and dan are friends again ?
mm @-@ hmm .
great , so we just need to get serena &apos;s phone .
i already did one better .
i replaced her s.i.m. card with a new one ,
and i put all her contacts in
so she can call out ,
but this phone has her actual s.i.m.
so we get all her incoming calls and texts .
and we can send whatever responses we want ,
and she &apos;ll never know
because her phone &apos;s not even missing .
you know , if you stuck around here ,
we would all be working for you in a week .
okay , so you guys wait for incoming calls ,
and i ... am gonna go meet lily .
i &apos;ve been rethinking dinner .
i read a few more reviews ,
and the crowds are big , and the portion are small .
i read the same thing .
why waste our time on mediocrity ?
where exactly did you read that ?
i assume the same place you did .
i didn &apos;t !
i lied because anne archibald doesn &apos;t want
the face of her foundation
to be associated with chuck bass .
what &apos;s your excuse ?
k.c. thinks you &apos;re too good for my bad reputation ,
and it &apos;s hurting business .
well , we can &apos;t very well risk our futures
for some meaningless dinner .
even if it would be wrong to assume we &apos;re anything more
than old acquaintances sharing a side of spinach .
why take the risk ?
i &apos;ll see you at your place . is now too soon ?
don &apos;t look at me like that .
you &apos;re the one who &apos;s black and white and read all over .
how do you think that happened ? a secret relationship .
but chuck and i are not in a relationship .
what are you , a foot fetishist ? they &apos;re done .
b , come on .
you and chuck have way too much history
to interact in a casual way .
i just don &apos;t want to see you get hurt
or lose this opportunity with anne .
i won &apos;t , as long as i keep my heart locked away
and our interactions off the street .
as for your devoted suitors ,
have you finally decided on whom to crush ?
no , and i have feelings for both ,
and i don &apos;t want to hurt either .
i have a whole new appreciation for &quot; big love . &quot;
well , even in utah ,
only the men get to have more than one spouse ,
which , i &apos;ve come to realize , is extremely sexist .
you should add it to the girls inc. agenda .
but seriously , b , what am i supposed to do ?
and please don &apos;t say make a list ,
because eric and elliot already tried that .
lists are for kids .
dilemmas like these require a meditative state .
i find mine by watching dorota feed the ducks .
you can borrow her as long as she &apos;s back by dinner .
thank you , but ducks and dorota couldn &apos;t compare
to the zen of shopping .
so go forth to madison and seek out the perfect dress ,
and then follow your heart to the perfect guy .
okay , sensei . i actually have to get something
for the black and white ball tonight ,
so i have nothing to lose .
but remember , when it comes to chuck , you do .
all right , so it &apos;s decided .
we &apos;ll each invite her on a best date ever ,
something that &apos;s true to who we are ,
shows her why we &apos;re the right guy .
oh , so you &apos;re gonna take to her
to one of those weird movies
that doesn &apos;t make sense even
when you read the subtitles ?
no , i &apos;m gonna take her to frankie &apos;s 457 .
she &apos;ll feel like she discovered something new ,
a place where no one cares
if she &apos;s serena van der woodsen .
aw , dude .
i won already .
why ,
cause you &apos;re gonna go make her watch you play lacrosse ?
she loves lacrosse ,
especially when it &apos;s followed by dinner at per se ,
and everyone we grew up with was talking about
how perfect we are together .
all right , you &apos;re on ,
for tonight , before chuck &apos;s party .
done .
and whoever she says &quot; yes &quot; to is the guy she wants .
never , never to be discussed or debated again .
okay .
hey , don &apos;t worry . i &apos;m not one of those winners
who rubs it in the loser &apos;s face , okay ?
okay ?
seriously , how many times can blair text that
she knows she &apos;s being paranoid
but she just wants to make sure
that serena isn &apos;t going after anne archibald &apos;s foundation ?
well , we should write back and thank her
for giving us exactly the information we needed .
oh , this is perfect .
dan and nate both invited her out tonight .
and serena &apos;s gonna reject both of them ,
but only after she toys with them enough
to make them hate her , at least for tonight .
as much as i find k.c. personally abhorrent .
she &apos;s right about black and white .
it &apos;s decent rather than decadent .
did you have something more devious in mind ?
saints and sinners has a nice feel .
there is something alluring about an angel drawn to the dark side .
or a devil redeemed .
a masquerade .
mmm , where inhibitions can &apos;t help but break free .
i &apos;ll let k.c. and gossip girl know .
how to impress anne with your virtue ?
i could denounce your unseemly party .
at a tasteful dinner , in front of the whole board .
oh , woe is me , indeed , oh , woe is me , indeed
oh , woe is me , indeed
this really is a beautiful friendship .
oh , woe is me , indeed
see , the devil got my eye
my black balenciaga will be perfect
to publicly condemn you .
i love public .
i love condemnation .
i love you .
to my heart so i can &apos;t all make it back ...
of course , no one does black like dior .
i appreciate the tea , mrs. humphrey ,
but i &apos;m not really sure why i &apos;m here .
well , i knew you had a problem with serena
when you tried to keep her out of hamilton house ,
but it &apos;s come to my attention
that you are also responsible for page six .
yes , well , i guess that &apos;s the thing
when you &apos;re not born with a silver spoon in your mouth .
you wanna eat , you have to work .
yes , and it seems
that you &apos;ve made a career out of harassing my daughter .
serena and colin are over .
do not continue to jeopardize her future .
i won &apos;t mention colin &apos;s name again , i swear ...
if only he were the only teacher
serena had an inappropriate relationship with .
i &apos;m not sure what you &apos;re referring to .
oh , i &apos;m pretty sure that you are .
something like that does not go down without a parent knowing .
i mean , boarding school ?
serena was a minor .
anyway , knowing that it &apos;s a pattern ...
might help dean reuther find her grounds for expulsion .
so how much will it take for you to leave my daughter alone ?
oh , i don &apos;t know .
this design is brilliant , and i have nothing like it .
but that one i could wear everywhere .
how is this better than venn diagrams ?
maybe i should get both .
i @-@ i thought the point was to choose .
attention , party people--
bass &apos; black and white has added some fire and ice .
whether you &apos;re a saint or a sinner ,
the afterlife never looked so good .
great . now neither of these will work .
should i be a saint or a sinner ?
no . dan vs. nate was hard enough .
i am not touching good vs. bad ,
serena . we &apos;ll see you later .
we should go as bacchus and sergius .
yes , we should .
thanks , guys .
thank you .
i &apos;m not so sure white &apos;s your color .
what are you doing here ?
i assume you mean , how can a poor girl like me
afford anything in a place like this ?
you only have yourself to blame for colin cutting you off .
luckily , i have a new benefactor .
i think you know her . lily ...
van der woodsen ? bass ? humphrey ?
what is her last name ?
oh , you know what ? i can just look at the check .
my mom already called the &quot; post . &quot;
page six is printing a retraction .
why would she give you anything ?
i guess she didn &apos;t want
the whole world to know you other secret .
what a shame for everyone to find out
what an embarrassment it is to have you as a daughter .
hey , uh , you don &apos;t happen to be at the loft
with a blonde we don &apos;t talk about .
i &apos;m here . serena &apos;s not .
did you need me to leave before she gets here ?
no , no , no . i was expecting her here at the park anyway .
i just ... i thought maybe my loft
was the only place she knew in brooklyn .
thanks anyway .
serena &apos;s not there waiting for me , is she ?
why would she be ?
i thought you scared her off with your heartfelt declarations .
no , she was supposed to meet me at the frick .
i don &apos;t know what happened .
we must &apos;ve had some miscommunication .
they do seem to be your area of expertise .
in fact , you &apos;ve probably said your share
of inappropriate things during intercourse .
so what &apos;d you do ? did you call a girl by another girl &apos;s name ?
talk a little too dirty ?
it &apos;s not funny . i may have uttered
those three little words that change everything .
but she probably didn &apos;t even hear me .
scientifically speaking ,
intense pleasure does dull the other senses .
relax , man .
girls know that when a guy says that during sex .
it doesn &apos;t mean &quot; i love you . &quot;
it means , &quot; i love having sex with you . &quot;
of course .
thanks .
for mrs. archibald and the ladies ,
i ordered petrossian caviar and blini for appetizer .
why would you do that ?
you know mr. chuck loves caviar .
but--but you love , too . e @-@ everyone loves--
okay , fine , dorota .
since you badgered it out of me , yes , it &apos;s true .
chuck said he loved me while in a compromising position .
he did ?
he did .
oh , this is just like in book
when time traveler comes to declare love for lost princess .
yes , but unlike your dirty , long @-@ haired lothario ,
chuck probably didn &apos;t mean it .
he simply blurted it out in the height of passion .
but mr. chuck does not seem like blurter .
well , he &apos;s obviously become one , and i ... did the polite thing
and acted like i didn &apos;t hear .
you didn &apos;t say &quot; i love you &quot; back ?
and be a weak , sniveling , &quot; stand by your man &quot;
who never runs a foundation or anything else ? no !
i am an empowered woman , and i won &apos;t let
three words that were probably meaningless change that .
this is obviously distracting you from your work .
did you pay juliet off ?
uh , bruce , let me call you back .
if you mean , did i ask juliet
to stop leaking information to page six ? the answer is yes .
you never believed that i didn &apos;t sleep with colin , did you ?
you just said that to the dean
so that i could stay at columbia .
i wanted you to be able to move forward
and focus on your future .
what did she even say she has ?
what &apos;s important is that it &apos;s taken care of .
she has nothing because i did nothing .
so you believe her over me ?
you know , you just let yourself get blackmailed for no reason .
can you blame me ?
it &apos;s not like you have a history of great decision making .
how can i when you disapprove of every choice i &apos;ve ever made ?
no matter how hard i try to do the right thing ,
you always just assume the worst .
lobster potpie ,
cheesecake in a jar , and ...
john delucie !
chuck asked me to make sure everything was perfect .
chuck did this ?
so romantic , like in book
when time traveler sends sign of true love from future ,
and princess needs to get to grand ball where he is waiting .
and if she too late , the rift in the time @-@ space continuum
close up forever .
miss blair ?
uh , we have mixed company .
tell anne and the board that i &apos;ve been delayed .
and unless you want to raise ana in poland ,
don &apos;t let them leave before i get back .
where you going ?
mm . straight to hell with all the other sinners .
hey , what are you doing here ?
we agreed to let this go after the text .
yeah , i know , and she texted me that she &apos;d meet me ,
only she stood me up .
i &apos;m guessing she did the same thing to you .
yeah .
what are you guys doing here ? this is really not a good time .
yeah , and obviously you &apos;re not gonna end this . so we are .
you know how we both feel .
you have until midnight to decide .
eric just texted serena to see how she &apos;s doing
after the blow @-@ out with her mom
and to make sure she &apos;s still on for dinner .
now the only one left is blair .
here . give this resume to one of
anne archibald &apos;s foundation board members at dinner .
tell them that serena would like to be considered for the position .
what do i do if blair sees me ?
lie .
looks like the battle between brooklyn and the upper east side
had finally come to a head .
word has it lonely boy and golden boy both declared their love .
they gave cinderena until midnight to decide .
that carolina herrera dress
makes her look like an angel ,
but this decision is demonic ...
i can &apos;t believe it . dan and nate will forgive her anything .
how do we keep her from making a choice ?
we don &apos;t . we make it for her .
take off your clothes and take out your credit card .
and the forces of evil are just getting started .
i should &apos;ve known taking down serena
involved wearing the perfect dress .
well , anytime i can combine styling with revenge ...
plus , this isn &apos;t exactly
my first masquerade party .
i &apos;ll see you inside .
good luck , man .
yeah , you , too .
serena van der woodsen .
go ahead .
thank you .
that should keep serena out long enough
for us to make her life hell .
i got serena &apos;s resume to anne ,
but blair &apos;s not here .
she &apos;s here . i just spotted her .
now you just need to figure out a way
to get the board meeting moved here .
i don &apos;t think these ladies wanna witness
chuck &apos;s eternal damnation .
tell anne that blair &apos;s arranged a special surprise
to show her dedication to girls inc .
and , vanessa ,
you really need to start showing more initiative .
jenny &apos;s carrying you on this thing .
i know .
hey !
serena , have you seen chuck ?
wait !
i know that you don &apos;t think
you my being with him is a good idea ,
but you have bad ideas all the time .
i don &apos;t wanna lose the foundation ,
but what &apos;s wrong with wanting to keep it secret
just long enough to find out how he really feels ?
i didn &apos;t approve of your thing with colin ,
but at least i had the decency to talk to you about it .
well , i didn &apos;t ,
but you should !
i know it &apos;s not my bolognese .
no , rufus . i &apos;m sorry . it &apos;s delicious .
i &apos;m just--i &apos;m just upset about this serena situation .
i thought we &apos;d all moved on .
and serena broke things off with colin .
the &quot; post &quot; is apologizing .
the dean can &apos;t force serena out of school .
and by next semester , this whole thing will be forgotten .
well , it &apos;d be a lot easier
if colin was the first teacher
that serena had been involved with .
really ? someone at constance ?
boarding school .
boarding school ?
serena was just a kid .
serena was never a kid . believe me .
this was after the shepherd wedding ,
pete fairman ...
it didn &apos;t end well .
i was lucky i found a way to handle it .
well , just because it happened then
doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s happening now .
hey . listen , i &apos;m sorry for laying it on the line
like that earlier . it &apos;s just--
serena , you have no idea the hell you &apos;ve put me through .
it is me , right ?
so you ready ?
as hard as it &apos;s gonna be ,
i @-@ i know what i have to do .
hi . uh , eric and serena van der woodsen
and elliot leichter .
go on in .
what was that name again ?
oh , i &apos;m sorry . i thought he told you .
serena van der woodsen .
nice try ,
but she &apos;s already inside .
well , that &apos;s a mistake because i &apos;m her .
sorry . do you have i.d. ?
i didn &apos;t come to rent a car . everyone here knows me .
eric , can you get chuck or k.c. ?
and hurry , please .
i don &apos;t want to keep them waiting .
serena !
hey , there you are .
excellent .
that--that was a ... kiss hello , right ?
not a kiss good @-@ bye ?
i think i might need another to be sure .
are--are you gonna tell nate ?
let him know i &apos;m , uh , i &apos;m sorry .
i mean , not sorry enough to want you to change your mind , but ...
i avoided kc &apos;s prying eyes .
i appreciate that , and you being here half @-@ dressed .
but don &apos;t you have a denouncement to attend ?
dorota &apos;s distracting the board
with delucie &apos;s cavatelli
until i get back .
i heard what you said .
what conversation are you referring to exactly ?
three one @-@ syllable words that , under the circumstances ,
you may or may not have meant .
do you want me to have meant them ?
if they were true , i would want to know .
of course .
people do this irrational thought during sex .
they bark and scream out for god and their mothers .
well ... i should get back to anne .
i meant it , blair ...
with all my heart .
you gonna say something this time ?
i will . i @-@ i mean ...
i do .
you realize we can &apos;t have everything .
anne won &apos;t be the only person
who might think you &apos;re weak for forgiving me .
and you won &apos;t build a business
based on being new york &apos;s bad boy bachelor .
i understand the consequences .
are you willing to pay them ?
serena , what are you doing ? !
looks like saints and sinners
aren &apos;t the only ones battling for souls tonight .
what you say we go up in flames together ?
it &apos;s no surprise c and b succumbed to the dark side .
but how about the boys
from opposite sides of the bridge ?
it &apos;s hard to get word
when they &apos;re both lip @-@ locked with serena van der woodsen .
lucky i have the pictures to prove it .
anne ? i can explain .
i &apos;m not sure how this shows
your dedication to girls inc .
you know , you lost any sympathy i may have had
for your previous choices the moment i saw you
kissing charles in your underwear .
shouldn &apos;t empowered women get to have relationships , too ?
being with chuck doesn &apos;t make me less blair .
i &apos;m sorry , but it does .
the man you &apos;re with may not be a reflection of you ,
but you will always be a reflection of him .
that &apos;s not fair .
maybe not , but the sooner you accept it ,
the easier your decisions will be .
and please tell serena
while i appreciate her interest in the position ,
she &apos;s not the type of girl we &apos;re looking for either .
at least she was polite .
i doubt we &apos;ll have that with kc .
give me a minute . i have to go find serena .
how could i have kissed either of you
when i couldn &apos;t even get into the party ?
so someone dressed exactly like you ,
wearing your perfume ,
just happened to be attracted to both of us ?
i @-@ i don &apos;t know . i @-@ i can &apos;t explain it .
so this mystery person
texted us from paris , too ?
and used us to make some adjunct professor jealous
and stood us up ?
no , i am partially responsible for this .
i came here tonight to tell you how i felt .
doesn &apos;t that count for more than a &quot; gossip girl &quot; blast ?
we can &apos;t keep chasing you in circles .
you didn &apos;t make the choice . we made it for you .
i didn &apos;t do this .
i &apos;m with him . so good @-@ bye , serena .
b , you know i didn &apos;t kiss both of them .
do i ? it &apos;s no worse than what you did to me and chuck .
what ?
i had nothing to do with you coming here in your underwear .
you knew what you had to lose .
i kept trying to figure out why you would expose us .
and then anne archibald told me
that you wanted to be the face of her foundation .
oh , come on . when are you gonna give it up ?
i don &apos;t want everything that you want .
i couldn &apos;t be less interested .
so anne , nate , and dan are all liars ?
that &apos;s a lot of people to blame , even for you .
just admit you did the wrong thing ,
or maybe you don &apos;t even know what that is anymore .
you know , you &apos;re not the first person to say that today ,
so i guess it must be true .
you know , it was a bad choice thinking that you &apos;d be on my side .
not as bad as my believing
that you &apos;d ever be happy for my success .
hey . whoa , serena . hey , don &apos;t run off .
why not ? mom &apos;s not the only one
who still sees me as a messed @-@ up 16 @-@ year @-@ old .
no one can see that i &apos;ve changed . no one cares .
i @-@ i care .
you &apos;re my little brother . you &apos;re not enough .
you &apos;re just in time to hear k.c. tell me
how i &apos;ve destroyed my bad boy business plan
once and for all .
i warned you , but it turns out i was wrong .
this party is so decadent
and in the private rooms ,
frankly , illegal .
the big romantic gesture showed
the hedonist has a heart .
so blair &apos;s the perfect balance ?
with the press this will get ,
you can expect the hotel will be fully booked by monday .
i &apos;m already getting calls for personal appearances .
in fact , i would love to get you some photo ops .
you know , chuck bass &apos; girlfriend at store openings ,
fashion shows , that kind of thing .
call me and we &apos;ll schedule .
it appears the rules are there to be broken .
we can have everything .
no , you can .
it &apos;s me who can &apos;t .
hey , hey . it &apos;s okay . come on . i got you .
in the battle between good and evil ,
score one for the sinners .
hi . sorry .
my friend &apos;s had a little bit too much to drink .
looks like s. could end up the next saintly sacrifice .
pleasant dreams , sweet angel .
i &apos;ll give you the money to start whatever foundation you want .
it won &apos;t change anything . anne &apos;s right .
as long as i &apos;m with you , i &apos;m hillary in the white house ,
and i wanna be hillary secretary of state ,
but with better hair .
then you &apos;ll find another way to show the world
you &apos;re a force to be reckoned with .
we &apos;ll build our futures together .
i followed my heart all last year
and it led me nowhere .
now i need to follow my head .
you don &apos;t need to choose between them .
look at brad and angelina .
they takes turns on top .
yeah , but she won an oscar first .
i &apos;m sorry , but i have to be blair waldorf
before i can be chuck bass &apos; girlfriend .
i love you .
i love you , too .
i don &apos;t expect you to wait .
if two people are meant to be together ,
eventually they &apos;ll find their way back .
do you really believe that ?
i do .
so do i.
still no juliet ?
no . but i gotta get back to hudson
before my luck runs out and i run smack into blair and my dad .
well , it was nice to finally win one for team brooklyn .
you sure you can &apos;t stay and celebrate ?
i can try texting juliet again .
我明白你的意思了 你说的没错
that &apos;s the thing about destiny .
instead of too many choices ,
you suddenly have none .
the prince of darkness finally sees the light ,
only to realize it &apos;s no longer an option ...
and the time for love has come and gone .
well , not to sound like a high school cheerleader ,
but i @-@ i @-@ i &apos;m glad
we were in this together .
you &apos;re not hot enough to be a high school cheerleader ,
but me , too . otherwise , i &apos;d probably be looking
for a reason to blame you .
and you did make a damn good scapegoat .
hey , you wanna go play red dead redemption ?
one ground rule , though . one .
serena van der woodsen does not exist .
perfect .
the rest of us just have to keep moving forward ...
yes , of course . i understand .
she &apos;s over 18 .
y @-@ well , thank you for your call .
that was dean reuther .
your sister just withdrew from columbia .
alienate everybody , drop out of school , run away--
that sounds like serena .
you &apos;re right .
i &apos;m not sure there &apos;s anything we can do anymore .
accept the choice is out of your hands .
it &apos;s up to the fates to decide .
