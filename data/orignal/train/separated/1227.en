Alison DiLaurentis planned and carried out
the murder of Mona Vanderwaal.
Hanna has been arrested.
But we'll figure this out.
No one is gonna believe us.
Getting a little tired of memorializing Mona.
Are you saying that the world's better off without her?
I have done a lot to get that.
I did it to protect the one person
that matters most to me.
You didn't kill anyone.
No.
But I let a lot of things happen that I shouldn't have.
Have you reached a verdict?
Guilty of murder in the first degree.
There is nothing you can do.
It is too late to help her or her friends.
They chose to help the wrong person.
I didn't think I could feel worse after "A" killed Mona.
But the four of us getting arrested for her murder
brings low to a whole new level.
Technically, they think that we're accessories, not killers.
An accessory is a necklace or a handbag,
not a chain gang.
Call it what you want.
We're all going to jail.
"A" wins.
Why do you think they're separating us from Ali?
There's a lady in the laundry.
If you do her work, she gives you information.
Yesterday she told me that the warden received an anonymous tip.
They think the five of us are plotting something big.
What, and they think Ali's the big bad wolf?
But does that make us the little pigs or Little Red?
Doesn't matter.
A wolf can't lead without her pack.
When we get there,
they're probably going to split us up, too.
What's it like, Han?
Do you want me to sugarcoat it or tell you the truth?
Well, if I'm going to get through it,
I need to know what to expect.
The second they slam that door shut, you feel ashamed.
This is crazy. We didn't do anything.
They don't care about that.
They treat you like a criminal,
and it's hard to remember that you're not one.
The first night's the hardest.
You're locked away from everything
and everyone you ever cared about.
And when they turn those lights out,
it is the loneliest feeling you could ever imagine.
Second thought, I could have used a thick coat of sugar.
You can't be ready for how it feels, Em.
It's hard not to give up on hope.
You guys, they can take everything from us,
but they can't take us from each other.
I don't care how far apart from you guys I am,
I will still be with you.
Me, too.
Same here.
I love you, guys.
Love you.
What the hell was that?
We just had an accident.
Yeah, I did in my pants.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Get back. Get back!
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
We think the transport officers were neutralized
with an injection of flunitrazepam.
The date rape drug?
The deputies regained consciousness this morning
with no memory of the incident.
The girls were wrongfully accused to begin with.
And now they're all missing?
Let's get our facts straight.
The incident was an abduction.
Yeah, but who would want to take the girls?
Should we be asking who would or who could?
If Mona was alive...
I keep thinking this feels like that.
No. No.
There's only been one person at the center of any trouble
the girls have gotten into.
You think Alison's behind this?
Alison's a master manipulator,
but she doesn't have access
to what was needed to pull off something this elaborate.
Why these girls?
What would make them somebody's target?
Well, the good news is Tanner wants to keep this
out of the press.
No one knows about this yet.
Wait, not even the other girls' parents?
We have to keep this between us.
We don't want a civilian mob out there
being told to shoot first and ask questions later.
But if they think our daughters are fugitives,
isn't that what Tanner's telling the police to do?
You're damn straight it is.
All units in the vicinity of Whitewood and Stuckey,
possible domestic violence...
Could you just give me one second please?
Now Alison may still be locked up,
but she has access to people.
We both know what she's capable of.
Mom?
Mom!
Hello?
Can anybody hear me?
Aria?
Hanna, Spencer?
Is anybody here?
What the...
JN-49163-B
Please exit your room and follow the lighted pathway.
Oh, my God.
Is everybody okay?
What is this place?
I think this is "A's" house.
More like "A's" dollhouse.
Yeah, and we're the dolls.
Please follow the lighted pathway.
Please follow the lighted pathway.
We heard you, bitch.
Ali, is that you?
Oh, my God!
Mona?
Mona?
I know it's been a while,
but I haven't changed that much, have I?
You guys, it's me...
Alison.
Caleb got into the PD's command center.
And if you cross-check the van's GPS system
with the PD's system, it goes dead right here.
On Route 30, near the railroad crossing.
That's when "A" hacked into the van's computer system
and took remote control of the vehicle.
Okay, so "A" would have needed to be near
to keep the van on the road.
The overpass would have given "A" a clear view
and also cover from the deputies.
Are there any traffic cameras in the area
that you can hack into?
I am one step ahead of you.
Backing up that footage now.
One frame of "A," that's all we need.
I can't believe it's really you.
There has to be another way out.
There is not.
Now come, sit down.
It's tea time.
Tea time?
What is this place?
Do you know where we are?
We're in my living room, Spencer.
This is my house.
Why are you acting like such an imbecile?
Han, it's not like you're gonna gain it
all back by eating one cookie.
You know you want one.
We really thought you were dead.
Thank God for Mrs. Grunwald.
I don't know how I'll ever repay her
for saving my life that night.
I'm so happy to see you guys.
We're really happy to see you too, Mona.
Do not call me that again.
You know how much I loathe that bitch.
It's her hair.
So, Alison...
More tea?
We need to start the game.
What if we don't want to play?
Four chimes means it's game time.
The object of the game is to be ready for your date
by acquiring an outfit.
Then you get to open the door
and find out who your mystery date is.
Like this.
Wait, that's from the Ice Ball.
No. I'm not going to sit here and play this stupid game.
There's something for everyone today.
梦寐以求的一晚 强制性出席
These are invitations to prom.
I think we're playing the game to see
who our prom dates will be.
No, I'm not.
You win. Okay?
You can have us as your precious dolls.
But if Caleb shows up here,
if you do anything to hurt him, I will kill you.
Hanna! No.
You are not Alison.
You're Mona, okay?
And this is not your house.
You're not here alone anymore.
There are five of us,
and one of him, her, it, bitch.
Hanna's right.
Let's find a way to get the hell out of here.
Mona, let's go.
My name is Alison. Alison DiLaurentis.
Mona, let's go!
What is that?
It's trying to warn you.
Guys, I can't take it.
Oh, my God.
Mona! Hurry!
Guys!
It won't stop until you're in your rooms!
It should be coming up.
You can't get to that overpass without passing a camera, right?
What the...
"A" Found a way to override the camera.
"A's" mocking us with a damn cartoon.
Are you okay?
I'll go get you some ice for that.
I don't need ice. I need to find Aria.
And we've got nothing. Nothing!
If I can find the right code,
then maybe I can write a program
that'll pinpoint the source of the hacker's signal.
That's all we need to prove to Tanner
that "A" took control of the van.
We've got 3 minutes. Come on!
Every night the main generator shuts down like clockwork.
It takes exactly 3 minutes for the back-up power to kick in.
I have run for 90 seconds in each direction.
That's the way out, but there's an old silo at the end,
and you have to climb up.
There is a ladder,
but it's about 50 feet to the top.
And you can't get there before the power turns on
and all the doors lock again.
That leads to a big, empty room.
There's nothing there. It's not a way out.
But if you go past it, there's a steel door
at the end of the hall and it's sealed like a vault.
Like a bank vault? What's inside?
I'm dying to know, too, Spencer.
But I've never made it inside.
It's too far to make it back to your room.
What happens if you don't make it back in time?
It leaves you for days without food or water.
It blasts the siren until you'd rather die
than listen to it one more second.
On a loop it plays a recording of the people
that you've left behind, crying at your funeral.
Is my mom okay?
You know you're Mona.
It wanted me to become Alison.
So that's who I am when it's watching.
It thinks it beat me.
But I'm still here.
I'm the one who's winning the game.
Is she okay?
My mom?
I saw her a lot in the beginning.
But there was a trial.
They convicted Ali for your murder.
And they arrested us as accessories.
I didn't think you were wearing that
to make a fashion statement.
Yep, she's Mona.
Your mom never showed up to the courthouse.
We heard that it was all too much for her.
God, Mona, I'm so happy that you're okay.
Did you hear that?
Hear what?
We've got 17 seconds. Run!
Is Spencer ok?
You can drop the whole caring friend act.
We know exactly who and what you are.
I've done some bad things, Mr. Hastings,
but like it or not,
I am Spencer's friend.
You forced our daughter to lie for you.
Now she's in as much trouble as you are.
I was desperate.
And so are we.
Do you know where she is?
Spencer?
No.
Don't you?
Alison, I promise you that guard outside
will not be able to save you if you lie to us tonight.
What happened?
Their van never made it to the penitentiary.
The police think that they escaped.
But we know that's not true.
I don't know where they are.
But I do know who took them.
We're listening.
It's "A."
Any chance of "A" hurting those girls again died with Mona.
Mona was "A."
That's true.
But it all started again
when she was locked up in Radley.
It was the same game, but with a new puppet master.
And the stakes were higher than ever.
This "A" killed my mom and Mona.
Oh, come on.
If you really believe that, then why didn't you go to the police?
Hanna tried, but there wasn't any proof.
There never is.
Why would it start all over again?
It doesn't make any sense.
Mona was sick.
We know that that's why she wanted to hurt the girls.
I'm telling you the truth.
I swear it.
Why be honest now?
I'm going to spend the rest of my life in here.
I don't have anything else to lose.
But you do.
It has a name.
For me?
Would you like me to put it on?
It's all there in black and white.
Somebody cyber-jacked the van and kidnapped the girls.
You put a lot of work into this theory.
It's not a theory, it's the facts.
Yes, I know.
Our analyst gave me
a very similar report this morning.
Take a look.
Dispatch.
Put out an APB for Caleb Rivers.
Yes, ma'am.
What?
You don't happen to know where he is,
do you, Officer Cavanaugh?
No. I--
I haven't seen him for days,
but what does Caleb have to do with this?
These reports do prove that someone
cyber-jacked that vehicle.
And I'm betting that it is Caleb Rivers.
I think he knows where his girlfriend is.
You guys, the blocks in the playroom spelled out a name.
Charles.
Please find your stations.
"Aria Montgomery, music committee."
"Emily Fields and Spencer Hastings,
decorating committee."
"Hanna Marin, food and beverage."
Bite me.
"Alison DiLaurentis, prom queen election committee."
All these songs are from like 7 years ago.
A Night At The Opera.
That was the prom theme the last year that Melissa took Ian.
So "A's" recreating a prom we already had?
Well, if I'm on the election committee,
you can be sure I'll win that crown.
Sort of like old times, huh, Spencer?
Remember when I rigged the election for you
to win class president?
Want to fill some of these out?
I'll help you if you help me.
Sure.
If "A" doesn't mind,
maybe we can all help each other,
starting with these ballots.
We know about "A."
You ok?
So this is going to be our senior prom?
We're decorating with construction paper and tape?
Maybe that's part of our punishment,
to put together the lamest prom ever.
You know, this space is actually pretty awesome.
I'm surprised "A" doesn't have the imagination to see it.
It's a big, ugly room.
Okay, but what if...
what if we use the staircase
to make a grand entrance for Ali to walk down?
We think Gloria Swanson in Sunset Boulevard.
All right, we could rig a bunch of cameras to go off
on a timer as you walk down those steps.
It'd be so easy to take all these copper pipes
and use them for drapery rods.
And we could use old pipes and make beautiful candelabras.
And we could hang wire from the ceiling
and hang shapes to create some beautiful shadows and silhouettes.
That would be A Night At The Opera.
We need to tell the other girls' parents what we know.
Agreed, but we were hoping to have some more answers
before we do that.
I don't understand why you can't take
this information to the police.
Everything we give Tanner
she twists to fit her own theory.
Then let's take our case to the media.
I can call Angela King at the Philadelphia Press.
She owes me a favor.
Mr. Hastings, with what we know about "A,"
that is just not the right move.
What do you know about "A?"
Everything's in those boxes.
And about a dozen more in a storage unit up on the North Highway.
How did we not see this happening again?
Forcing the girls to keep things from you
is what "A" does best.
All right. Well, maybe if we look at all this together...
we might find something that you guys missed.
But before you do that...
"A" didn't just prey on the girls.
Your secrets are in there, too.
And if you decide to open them,
you need to be prepared for those to come out.
No more secrets.
The police are downstairs.
And they want to come up.
They're here for me.
And you're harboring a fugitive.
You can't be here when they find him.
Don't stop looking.
Caleb, wait--
Toby...
He's doing the right thing.
And we need you on the right side of this,
and your boss.
It's Melissa.
Melissa...
V_海斯汀_移动电话987
There's something you need to know.
So "A's" a guy?
I don't know any girls named Charles.
Why would "A" give you a gas mask?
Ali's his favorite.
I think after the prom,
she's the only one he wants to keep.
So our Night At The Opera
is going to turn into a scene from Carrie?
No, we're not going to let that happen.
I know what you're thinking, Spencer,
but I promise you don't have time to make it to that vault.
So have you ever built one?
I haven't needed to build one.
But I've read about it.
Build what?
The stuff Spencer said she needed to decorate.
If it delivers,
we'll have what we need to build a machine
that temporarily shuts off the electricity.
How long is temporarily?
Long enough to get us out of here.
Yeah, we can turn off the power, but what about "A?"
And it's his prom.
There's no way he's not coming.
I hope you're right, Emily.
Because like Hanna said,
there's five of us and one of him.
Good morning. Guten tag. Bom dia.
Please find your stations.
This is not what I was expecting.
So now you're excited?
You're actually going to help "A" decorate this place?
We can use this to make a curtain for Ali's grand entrance.
Well, you're on your own.
Em, we're all in this together.
What are you doing?
Taking a stand.
By sitting?
This isn't my prom. I'm not helping.
Why are you being such a bitch?
I'm being a bitch? Take a look around.
Why are you making this so easy for "A"?
Oh, my God, drapes! Thanks, "A."
I'm so excited, I get to have my senior prom in a dungeon.
You know what? Forget it, Emily.
I don't need your help.
You did that on purpose.
Get over yourself.
Stop,
this is already stressful enough as it is.
Spencer, don't start--
I didn't start anything. The quitter did.
That's what you do, isn't it, Emily?
You quit things.
When things are too much for you,
you just throw in the towel.
I mean, you quit the swim team.
You quit Paige.
You even quit Maya.
Guys!
You, guys!
You guys!
Stop it!
Emily! Come on!
Stop.
Get her off!
Stop. Stop! Stop.
You guys, honestly, I cannot handle this.
Please, can we not do this to each other?
I'm sorry, Spence.
Okay, I know this isn't your fault.
Me, too.
Look, I'm just trying to make the best of a very bad situation.
If you baboons are done fighting,
I could use some help over here.
Then we can all decorate together.
If I knew where they were, I wouldn't be here right now.
I would be with Hanna.
I would like to believe you. But I...
But you don't and you won't. So let's quit wasting time.
You need to charge our client or release him.
You might not know exactly where they are,
but you know more than what you're telling me.
You're right. I know a lot more than you do.
Okay, son, I think it's time we go.
I hacked into your computer system,
and I found the location where you lost the van.
You just admitted to a federal offense.
I think he meant to say if he hacked
into your system he could find the van.
And if he had further access to that system,
he may be able to...
Override the hacker's jamming signal and locate the van.
Those are some big "Ifs."
I think the bigger "Ifs" are what if you're wrong?
What if someone did take the girls?
And because you haven't considered it,
you and your analysts are looking in all the wrong places.
Haven't you asked yourself how four teenagers
could be this good at evading the police?
You're not going to find the answer
investigating the girls
because they're not running from you.
There's no way that Hanna wouldn't call me if she could.
So is everything all set?
Yeah.
We're about as ready as we can be.
Aria,
since you're the photographer,
you should take the pictures.
You know how to work that, right?
Yeah. It's just point and shoot, isn't it?
Yeah, just save it for tonight though,
'cause there's only one first picture.
You know what I mean?
Got it.
Good afternoon.
Guten tag. Boa tarde.
Please follow the lighted pathway
and return to your rooms.
We got this.
Sometimes a hacker leaves a trail
intentionally coded to cover their tracks.
It's smoke and mirrors put there to distract you
while they're actually...
Did you find something?
Rivers?
Caleb?
The thing about coming in through the back door
is the view is entirely different.
40.0508 North,
75.4044 West.
Those are coordinates.
That's where the van is.
Are you sure about this?
Like I said, that's where the van is.
Call it in, Cavanaugh.
Hold the sirens, but have aerial assistance standing by.
Yes, ma'am.
We got a possible location on the missing van.
"A" thought of everything.
Clear!
Fan out and search the perimeter.
And remember, this could be a hostage situation.
So abide protocol.
Am I the only one who has goosebumps?
No.
Where is Mona?
I don't think she's here yet.
I guess that means we're supposed to dance.
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome your prom queen...
Alison DiLaurentis!
Charles!
We have something for you.
You should be standing up here, Charles.
It's what you want, isn't it?
This is your prom, Charles.
You should be crowned the king.
Wait for it.
Now!
Let's go.
Let's get the hell out of here. Let's go.
Hurry. Let's go.
Let's go, let's go, let's go. Go, go!
This is the old Campbell Farm.
We used to bring the girls here to go apple picking.
Lieutenant, over here.
What did you find?
What is this place?
It's "A's" lair.
Hurry up!
Hurry up, darling.
Oh, my God.
If this is your vault,
then these are the things you treasure the most.
You want to say good night to your sister
and give her a little kiss?
What a good boy you are.
Oh, good boys, good boys.
Is that you, Charles?
Spencer?
This is not at all what I thought it would be.
"A" has a soul.
Spencer!
Spencer, where are you?
Hanna! No!
You are not Alison. You're Mona.
And this is not your house, okay?
You're not here alone anymore.
There are five of us
and one of him, her, it, bitch.
My God.
We've searched the entire property.
There's no one here.
Then where is this place?
Let's find a way to get the hell out of here.
Mona, come on.
I'm Alison. Alison DiLaurentis.
For God's sakes, Mona, let's go!
What is that?
Hurry.
Oh, my God.
We're still trapped.
We can climb it. Let's go.
Stop!
