good afternoon , greendale community college .
i am your dean with a few corrections to the fall class catalog .
cosmology should be cosmetology ,
astrology should be astronomy ,
and the students on the cover should be smiling ,
but i suppose that &apos;s a matter of opinion .
whoever is growing a small patch of cannabis behind the gymnasium ,
congratulations . you have won a cruise .
report to security to claim your tickets .
in order to increase awareness of homelessness ,
security has been given binoculars .
in campus news ,
the debate over our library &apos;s pa system continues
with some students suggesting its volume be lowered ,
while others question its very purpose .
more on that story as it unfolds .
that dude makes a lot of announcements .
i like it ,
it makes every ten minutes feel like the beginning of a new scene of a tv show .
of course the illusion only lasts until someone says something they &apos;d never say on tv
like how much their life is like tv . there , it &apos;s gone .
i guess jeff &apos;s running late again .
what a shame . we should get started ...
no no no , i think we should wait for jeff before we start studying .
but maybe when jeff gets here ,
we could talk to him as a group about his tardiness .
come on , don &apos;t use that word around abed .
in any case , if you want me to have a chat with jeff , i &apos;d be happy to do it .
we &apos;ve got a bond going , kind of . sorta like brothers .
i hope your mom didn &apos;t make you take baths together &apos;
cause one of you would &apos;ve been like 30 .
that &apos;s funny .
you know , jeff probably comes late
so he doesn &apos;t have to sit through your tardiness .
sorry . abed .
will you guys have some self respect ?
you &apos;re obsessing over someone who does not give you a second thought .
meanwhile , in guatemala , journalists are being killed by their own government .
maybe you &apos;re jumped a column . what &apos;s happening in guatemala ?
nothing .
journalists are being murdered ?
believe me , every day in that country , people are being killed for speaking out .
the worst part of it is when it &apos;s over ...
spoilers .
it &apos;s gonna be as if it would never even happened .
abed .
real stories ... they don &apos;t have spoilers .
you understand that tv and life are different , right ?
milady .
milord .
baby .
sweetie .
you smell nice . vitamin p.
morning , jeffrey .
people were jazzed to see me too .
word &apos; em up .
word &apos; em everywhere .
good entrance .
that was for you .
thank you .
britta .
hey , jeff .
i think there &apos;s something that the group would like to talk to you about .
actually , there &apos;s nothing ...
okay , if you &apos;re gonna study with people ,
it would be cool of you to show up on time .
were you waiting ?
no .
i just got here .
cause you usually spend the first 20 minutes
talking about your interesting personal lives and your cool emotional problems .
i just feel i never have anything to offer .
no no , truth is my life is emptier than this three @-@ ring binder .
annie , do you have any spanish notes that might fit in there ?
double @-@ spaced . thank you .
so , what &apos;s a guy got to do to get a c around here ?
one @-@ liner .
第一季 第二集
see you later . bye .
you know what today is ?
the two @-@ week anniversary of my horrible first impression .
there &apos;s a card for that ?
not specifically ,
but if you think of grandsons as a metaphor for friendship ,
i think you &apos;ll agree with this transformer here
that it &apos;s time for ours to become a man .
by reading from the torah .
look , jeff .
you &apos;re harmless enough to me cause a life full of ups and downs
has given me douche @-@ ray vision , but those are good people in there ,
and they trust and respect you . watching you exploit them kind bums me out .
exploit them ? they &apos;re my friends .
you want me to bring your car around ?
no , abed .
i don &apos;t want you to bring my car around .
i &apos;ll bring yours around , good guy . you get going , all right .
you &apos;re cute ,
but selfish and narcissistic to the point of near delusion .
she said i was cute .
tell you what , you take her . i have less to prove .
you know , jeff . you can &apos;t pursue people so desperately .
it starts to creep them out .
why don &apos;t we go get a beer ? i &apos;ll give you some advice ,
and we can have what the kids calls a sausage fest .
i &apos;m not much of a sausage guy , pierce . maybe next time .
next time , then .
britta , will you tell us more about guatemala ?
i never went to a real college . i want to be political .
that &apos;s good , you guys should discover that stuff on your own .
but we need your help .
we &apos;ve been living on the wrong side of the looking glass .
you &apos;re like jodie foster or susan sarandon .
you &apos;d rather keep it real than be likeable .
can you at least tell us what to google ?
you could start with this journalist chacata @-@ panecos .
he wrote an article critical of the government , and they killed him .
that &apos;s horrible .
can we have a protest ?
i want to protest the hell out of something .
we could have a candlelight vigil
like lesbians have on the news .
i can make brownies .
brownies ?
every once in a while , a student come up to me and ask ,
&quot; senor chang , why do you teach spanish ? &quot;
they say it just like that .
&quot; why do you teach
spanish ? &quot;
&quot; why you ? &quot;
why not math ?
why not photography ?
why not martial arts ?
i mean , surely it must be in my nature
to instruct you in something
that &apos;s ancient and secret
like building a wall that you can see from outer space .
i &apos;ll tell you why i teach spanish .
it is none of your business , okay ?
now , i don &apos;t want to have any conversations
about what a mysterious and inscrutable man i am .
i am a spanish genius !
in espanol , my nickname is
&quot; el tigre chino &quot; !
&apos;cause my knowledge will bite her face off !
so don &apos;t question senor chang or you &apos;ll get bit .
ya bit .
ya bit !
friday manana , we &apos;ll have conversations with the rest of the class
using some of the phrases we learned in unit one .
you &apos;ll be partnering up in pairs of dos .
so if you look under your desk ,
you &apos;ll find a card with either a picture or a word on it .
for ejemplo , blondie aqui
has a card with a picture of a house on it .
so that means the person with the card with the word casa on it is her partner .
comprende , star @-@ burns ?
okay , see you friday . find your partners . have a great day .
and what do we say at the end of every class ?
hasta luego .
come on , hands ... 90 % of spanish .
hasta luego .
excenlletn , excenlletn .
abed , abed .
you want to trade cards ?
no .
i &apos;ll give you 20 bucks .
no .
50 bucks .
no , i don &apos;t want your money . i want your shirt .
what ?
i &apos;ve had my eye on it since registration first day .
all right , fine . give me your card .
i don &apos;t think you understand . i want to wear it out of here .
thanks .
gracias .
what are the odds ?
are you sure you didn &apos;t adjust the odds ?
i know abed &apos;s been eyeing that shirt for three weeks .
it &apos;s almost like you gave it to him so he would switch cards .
i gave abed my shirt because i &apos;m not selfish ,
which is something i guess you &apos;ll finally discover
while we are working on this .
tomorrow night ? dinner , drinks .
i think that &apos;s something we should discuss with our partners .
see , i did switch cards .
can you believe this ? what are the odds ?
that &apos;s a nice shirt . want to sell it ?
yes .
what &apos;s the moist towelette industry like ?
believe me , it &apos;s nothing like the product .
it &apos;s a hard , dry , large business .
destroyed all my marriages .
of course it didn &apos;t help i can &apos;t have children . i &apos;m not sterile .
in fact , it &apos;s a rare condition they call &quot; hyper @-@ virility . &quot;
apparently my sperm shoot through the egg like bullets .
can you believe that ?
i can &apos;t .
but you can , so that &apos;s fine .
so , the assignment is
to write a spanish conversation using those five phrases .
hemingway &apos;s lemonade .
we don &apos;t need to make it a long evening , we can just ...
what am i ? a piece of garbage to you ?
what ?
no .
got ya . come on ,
let &apos;s have one drink before we work .
to the &quot; empowerage &quot; of words .
to the irony of that sentence .
so what &apos;s up with you , jeffrey ?
seems like you got a burr up your ass or some .
well , i guess that it &apos;s ...
i think it &apos;s britta .
forget britta .
all you have to know about her is her name . what is she , a water filter ?
she &apos;s ugly .
why don &apos;t we start with me saying ...
what are you doing ?
our assignment .
no no no !
this is the first time people gonna see winger and hawthorne together .
we gonna show them we &apos;re a force to be reckoned with .
come on , let &apos;s brainstorm some story ideas .
better yet , before we do that , let &apos;s ask ourselves ...
what is a story ?
oh my god in heaven .
if you like that brownie , you &apos;ll hate what &apos;s up on in guatemala .
tell you that . google it .
raise the truth .
okay , once it gets dark ,
i hand out the candles and we do it &apos;s called a speechless protest .
we put tape over our mouths ,
and gather hand @-@ in @-@ hand in a sea of outraged silence .
star @-@ burns , no .
britta , what &apos;s got into you ?
this is not how you do this .
we know it &apos;s not how you do it cause we &apos;re doing everything .
but this is tacky and lame .
i didn &apos;t mean that .
i didn &apos;t mean that . i &apos;m sorry .
what i meant to say
is that this cause is really personal to me .
are you saying that we &apos;re not allowed to protest ?
britta , you sound like guatemala .
sounds like somebody has a case of
&quot; likes to use french politics to make themselves special ,
&quot; but doesn &apos;t actually ever want to do anything @-@ itis . &quot;
no , i do things .
i went to ...
i don &apos;t do anything .
what can i do ?
you can hang the chacata @-@ panecos pinata .
you guys realize he was beaten to death , right ?
that &apos;s where we got the idea from .
poignant .
all right .
okay , tell me what i &apos;ve got so far .
what we have so far ?
we have something incredibly long ,
and very confusing , and a little homophobic .
and really , really , specifically ,
surprisingly , and gratuitously critical of israel .
it &apos;s called &quot; two conquistadors , &quot; should probably be &quot; dos . &quot;
i mean , it is a spanish class .
which reminds me , the only thing not included in this
are the five phrases required to get me a passing grade .
you &apos;re right . needs more work .
what &apos;re you guys doing ?
i have no idea .
we head to the demonstration .
what ? hippies ?
some cause britta &apos;s into .
a silent protest . lots of candles .
gets the ladies in the mood for social change if you know what i mean .
good chance to put miles on this shirt .
you realize this conversations are due in the morning , don &apos;t you ?
right .
what do you want to do ?
hola , me llamo abed .
hola , me llamo troy .
donde esta la biblioteca ?
la biblioteca esta en la ciudad .
gracias .
hacks .
okay ,
what do we do about the ending of act two ?
i tell you what we &apos;re gonna do .
we gonna take this , and we gonna put it in a museum for crazy people .
then we &apos;re gonna take this ,
and memorize five phrases from it tomorrow morning before class .
good night .
wait a minute .
you &apos;re bailing on our first sausage fest ?
this is your definition of friendship ?
no , this is my definition of you trying way too hard ,
and me finding it harder and harder to stay polite .
now this was a fine enough way to spend an evening devoid of hope ,
but the woman i kind of like
is out there in the moonlight caring about something stupid ,
and this is my chance to show her that
i care enough to act like i care about too .
that &apos;s all you had to say . jeff .
that was it ?
that would &apos;ve been great if i had done that two hours ago !
nice sign .
thanks .
i like what you &apos;ve done with the place .
i think i was a little too harsh on you .
i &apos;m not perfect .
i am . i &apos;d be happy to show you the ropes .
awesome !
look at awesome jeffrey winger .
too awesome for old pierce
with your hip shirts ,
and your gelled hair ,
and your cool
tape over your mouth .
why are you wearing tape over their mouth ?
it &apos;s a protest , pierce .
good .
cause i know what i &apos;d like to protest ...
how much you hurt me .
conflicts like these will ultimately bring us together as an unlikely family .
you have horrible breath right now .
first , you constantly blow me off ,
then you want me to do your homework ,
ok .
then you tell me i &apos;m trying too hard to be your friend
so you have to go .
you have to come out here to pretend
to care about the stupid stuff she cares about .
his words , not mine .
he is paraphrasing .
pierce , i got an idea .
why don &apos;t you get a cup of coffee ,
and hold some waitress hostage with a monologue about your sperm .
i &apos;ll show you some sperm , buddy .
was this your idea ? what the hell ? fire .
i &apos;m not ready to die .
he &apos;s jumped in the fountain .
he &apos;s fine .
have you seen it ?
we did it , girl ... page three .
it &apos;s mostly about pierce , but listen to last paragraph .
&quot; the incident occurred during a protest regarding events in guatemala . &quot;
awareness !
it &apos;s not the school paper .
it &apos;s a real damn paper , there &apos;s a marmaduke in there .
well , it &apos;s more than i ever accomplished .
did you guys know about the ethnic cleansing in burma ?
need to bust out brownie mix .
morning .
morning .
no , i get it . garfield &apos;s wishing me a happy arbor day ,
you &apos;d like a fresh start .
nice try .
it &apos;s actually secretary &apos;s day , and it says i &apos;m sorry
about crashing your protest
with that drunken , self @-@ immolating baby boomer .
we don &apos;t blame you , sweety . pierce has always been on my watch list .
that dude is crazy ... he told me girls have two pee holes .
i sang christmas carols at a nursing home once .
i &apos;ve seen the face of dementia , and last night i saw it again .
you know what he did that &apos;s really crazy ?
he offered me $ 100 to switch cards with him
just so he could be partners with jeff .
i think he thought getting closer to jeff
would bring him respect in the group .
i think he spent his whole life looking out for himself
and he would trade it all for a shot at some kind of family .
hola class .
hola .
time for our presentations .
first up was supposed to be jeff and pierce ,
but pierce explained the situation to me .
apparently there was a falling out ,
things were said , people were betrayed .
jeff , having heard pierce &apos;s side of the story ,
i think the only humane thing to do would be to give you a c
and let pierce do his presentation alone ,
if that sounds fair to you .
that doesn &apos;t sound fair to me at all .
pierce , i understand if you don &apos;t want to be my friend ,
but this thing we &apos;ve created ...
it is bigger than the both of us ,
and it deserves to be done right .
okay , guys .
why are there costumes involved ? these are short conversations ,
they &apos;re not supposed to take ...
your breath away ?
well , tough .
you ready , amigo ?
si
f @-@ minus .
what ?
did you say s ?
so .
that was one of the worst things i have ever seen ,
which i guess makes being a part of it a pretty selfless act ,
so i &apos;m impressed .
how do you know i didn &apos;t do it just to get another shot at you ?
cause a smart guy like you would know that
no woman in that class would be able to look at you
as a sexually viable candidate ever again .
no , i know .
i thought of that .
she looked back .
you did an all right job up there , my friend .
thanks , pierce .
couple of notes , you got this thing you do with your face
when you &apos;re trying to be funny
that forces people to think about &quot; how cool you think you are . &quot;
what ? it &apos;s 2009 .
