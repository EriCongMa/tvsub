yeah .
ok . that face that you are making ...
i don &apos;t know you well enough to know what that means
you know those very happy cheerful people
who have everything .
and when the fact that they have everything comes up ,
they act very humble .
and they say , &quot; i &apos;m just so blessed . &quot;
those people -- you want to punch those people in the face .
yes . i do know those people .
yeah , i &apos;m one of those people now .
okay .
this morning , i was standing on my porch
of my perfect house looking in the window
at my amazing , perfect children
and my amazing , gorgeous husband ,
on the way to my amazing job .
and i thought to myself , &quot; i have everything i &apos;ve ever wanted .
i am just so blessed . &quot;
i really want pummel your face in right now .
right , i would beat myself up .
except i &apos;m too tired from --
were you about to say that you &apos;re exhausted
from all the great sex you &apos;re having ?
i am just so blessed .
i &apos;m gonna walk away from you now .
picture the life you dreamed of living ...
... the person you pictured being with .
picture the job you dreamed you &apos;d have .
i &apos;m a surgeon here at grey @-@ sloan ,
but i like to think of myself first as a teacher .
i train young doctors to become surgeons .
are you living the life you envisioned for yourself ?
are you who you wanted to be ...
you guys , let &apos;s get a picture . come on .
everybody , eyes over there .
one , two , three .
cheese ! cheese ! cheese ! cheese !
... when you grew up ?
i have some loose ends in d.c. ,
so i &apos;ll be flying back and forth for a few weeks .
tie them up , hand them off , and then i &apos;ll be here for good .
and you want to come back full @-@ time ?
that &apos;s the plan .
this is great .
you realize all this has to be approved ?
by whom ?
i &apos;m on the board . i have privileges .
by amelia .
of course . i &apos;ll ask amelia .
i am the head of the department of neurosurgery ,
and that means i operate on ... brains .
cool ! cool ! cool ! cool !
it &apos;s very cool , actually ,
because i fix the big , squishy , slimy computer
that runs your whole body .
if the brain goes , everything goes .
it is the coolest .
and , this is dr. derek shepherd ,
and he &apos;s a member of our board , and , um ...
i &apos;m her brother .
i &apos;m also a neurosurgeon . i work for her .
your sister &apos;s your boss ?
my sister &apos;s my boss .
okay , kids , uh , let &apos;s keep it moving .
thank you , doctors .
oh , sweet !
how hard was that for you to say ?
rolls off the tongue .
it &apos;s not gonna be like it was before .
i &apos;m not gonna angle for your job .
i &apos;m not gonna steal your patients . i just want to work .
you say that now , but i know you , derek .
i know us .
you grew up bossing me around .
i -- i don &apos;t know that this can work .
give me a chance , and i will show you .
i don &apos;t have anything for you today .
i @-@ i @-@ i &apos;m clipping an aneurysm later .
i will let you know .
you &apos;re not gonna make this fun , are you ?
it &apos;s a lot of fun for me .
no , no , no .
ew . super no .
wait , no , he &apos;s cute , i think . you &apos;re going so fast .
he &apos;s 32 and wearing a high @-@ school letterman jacket .
your glory days are over , steve . give it up .
you are so quick to judge .
it &apos;s a skill .
you spend enough time on this thing ,
you can learn everything you need to know
from the first picture .
will -- cares too much about his cars .
mike -- too close with those cats .
theo needs to learn to wear a shirt .
okay , okay , theo is a no @-@ go ,
but maybe your pickiness is keeping you
from going on any real dates .
you need to expand your horizons .
my horizons haven &apos;t been expanded in a very long time .
ugh , gross !
i mean , yes , but gross .
so , i am a plastic surgeon .
i also operate on the ear , nose , and throat .
this is dr. warren .
he is a terrific surgical resident .
and together , we form the plastics posse .
well , he calls us that .
yeah .
but , uh , i do not . - ah , it &apos;s -- it &apos;s what we &apos;re called .
it &apos;s , you know , what they call us .
no , see , they don &apos;t think it &apos;s cool because it &apos;s not .
well , it &apos;s not for them , ben . it &apos;s for us , okay ?
all right , kids , let &apos;s go check out the e.r.
all right . let &apos;s go .
making medicine cool .
huh ? not familiar with the high @-@ five .
all right .
so , i have a teleconference all day ,
so you can hold down the fort for me ?
but i &apos;m not on your service today .
you &apos;re always on my service .
at least in spirit . can i hear it ?
once ? you want to say it ?
no .
no ? thinking about it ?
nope !
plastics posse .
uh , ex @-@ excuse me .
yeah ?
i lost track of my kids .
and i ...
your kids ?
10 of them , fifth graders , varying heights .
oh , the field trip .
yeah , i went to the restroom , and i came out ,
and they &apos;d vanished , so i ...
you &apos;re a terrible chaperone is what you &apos;re saying .
that &apos;s what it looks like , yeah .
i think they &apos;re with dr. webber in the emergency room .
you don &apos;t , uh , happen to know where that is , do you ?
i do . follow me .
okay . thank you .
a trauma is any kind of injury .
so , if you cut yourself or you break your leg skateboarding
or wreck your bike , all of those injuries are called traumas ,
and that &apos;s what we are set up here to treat .
now , for a lot of people ,
the emergency room can be kind of a scary place ,
but it &apos;s actually --
cool . cool . cool .
a police car !
the police ! i need some help over here !
right here , right here , set him down .
kids , let &apos;s move .
we got two guys down .
we couldn &apos;t wait for the medics .
okay , i need a gurney . trauma room is in there .
back up .
page grey , torres . let &apos;s get cardio in here .
brett , they got you now , buddy . all right , you just relax .
you let them take care of you , okay ?
it &apos;s okay . okay , let &apos;s go .
where are they going ? is that policeman gonna die ?
all right , everyone stay calm .
everything &apos;s okay , all right ?
what &apos;s going on ?
multiple gunshot wounds from a robbery still in progress .
sounds like a bloodbath . whoa -- hi , kids .
sorry .
uh , i should probably go with them , right ?
did you get paged ?
no .
then no .
we should just take the kids back to the school .
no , we can &apos;t .
i can &apos;t reach the bus driver , and he &apos;s not due back till 3 : 00 .
is there someplace that we can --
dr. webber , you coming ?
yeah , i &apos;ll be right there .
um , kids , let &apos;s go see the babies .
it &apos;s nice and peaceful up there .
excuse me .
dr. edwards will take you .
i will ?
yeah , it &apos;ll be fine .
make medicine fun .
educate , entertain , inspire .
and keep them away from the scary stuff .
it was a bank robbery .
three suspects held up the bank tellers at gunpoint .
brett and i moved in first ,
but as soon as they saw us , they panicked .
they just started firing ,
hit me right through the side of my vest .
pete , try not to move your neck , okay ?
what are we looking at ?
two gunshot wounds to the upper @-@ left chest cavity .
at least three bullet holes in his left abdomen .
i &apos;m gonna need access .
here , i &apos;m gonna start a subclavian line .
have they brought brett in yet ?
he &apos;s being worked on right next door .
is he okay ?
he took the brunt of it .
two of them were armed .
brett took one of them down ,
then he grabbed the other one .
he ended the thing , even after he was hit .
he &apos;s the only reason i &apos;m standing here right now .
brett saved it .
blood &apos;s filling his chest cavity .
he &apos;ll need bilateral tubes .
betadine .
then take him up right now and start an ex @-@ lap .
pete , we &apos;re gonna cut into your chest
to place a tube that will help you breathe .
even with the pain meds , it &apos;s gonna hurt like hell ,
but it &apos;s the only way .
all right , c @-@ spine &apos;s clear .
i &apos;ll get out of your way .
uh , hey , you &apos;re bleeding quite a bit there .
i &apos;m fine .
no , you got shot in the leg .
come on . let &apos;s get you into a bed .
i need a nurse in here .
i &apos;m right outside , pete , all right ?
dr. hunt , the officer &apos;s mother is here .
richard , can you ?
yeah , go ahead .
we got it .
pete , you ready ?
they said i should speak to a doctor .
mrs. gibson , your son sustained multiple gunshot wounds .
we &apos;re assessing his injuries now ,
and i will update you as soon as we know more .
which one ?
i &apos;m sorry ?
which one of my sons ?
they &apos;re both here .
the gsw to the neck definitely hit the trachea .
and he &apos;s got one to the abdomen .
oh . brett , do not try to talk . we got you .
i need to crike him before he loses his airway .
okay , do it quickly .
i got to get him upstairs
and examine these abdominal injuries .
o.r. two is ready for us
whenever he &apos;s stable enough to transport .
guys , these two cops are brothers ,
and pete &apos;s injuries are pretty severe .
so let &apos;s not let their mother
lose two sons in one day .
move , please !
make way , guys . doctor coming through .
excuse me . excuse me ! excuse me , guys .
move , please .
um , do you think you could
maybe relocate your guys ?
i could try , but they &apos;ll never listen .
is there any update on brett ?
um , it is too early to say , but he &apos;s in good hands .
all right , now this looks like a through @-@ and @-@ through .
you &apos;re missing a chunk of muscle ,
and you have exposed bone fragments .
what ?
uh , no , i &apos;m -- just can &apos;t believe what i &apos;m looking at .
that bad , huh ?
no , no , no . i just mean i can &apos;t believe
that you carried your guy in on this leg .
i didn &apos;t have a choice .
no , of course you didn &apos;t . and you know what ?
you -- you can tell your guys
they can be wherever they need to .
i &apos;m dan . pruitt .
dr. callie torres .
there he is !
coming through !
is that another gunshot victim ?
oh , hey , hey , hey . no , no , no -- easy .
you got to stay off this leg .
multiple gsws to the right abdomen and chest .
okay , trauma three .
get him intubated , put in a central line ,
and send a trauma panel . move !
is he alive ? he &apos;s alive , right ?
do you know him ?
he &apos;s one of the suspects .
he was sitting in the car while the others were in the bank .
i want to know how he turns out .
hey , guys , do you see that one in the back ?
yeah , that &apos;s one of mine .
i operated on him before he was even born .
now he &apos;s two hours old and cute as a button .
a healthy little pop @-@ tart .
mm . pop @-@ tart ?
yeah , a fetus that &apos;s popped .
a baby that &apos;s born from his mother &apos;s womb .
you just ruined pop @-@ tarts for me .
yes ?
what &apos;s a womb ?
oh , boy .
you &apos;re taking at this .
i don &apos;t understand why
&apos;cause i &apos;m usually really good with kids .
i have a question .
go ahead .
is that policeman going to die ?
he was shot in the throat .
that &apos;s why he was gurgling blood like that .
and that means he can &apos;t breathe ,
so isn &apos;t he going to die ?
how we doing , pete ?
thinking of going for a run .
this one -- always the wise guy .
does this remind you of that trip to the e.r.
when i got hit by a pitch ?
you didn &apos;t even try to get out of the way .
nothing changes , right ?
i got to learn to duck .
mom ?
yes ?
remember that potluck we did a couple years ago ?
with all the guys in your backyard ?
when we get out of here , we got to do that again , okay ?
but bigger , m @-@ more people .
we &apos;ll invite these doctors . everybody loved it .
okay . sure , honey .
we were gonna make it an annual thing , remember ?
we never did .
we got to do that --
pete ?
peter ? !
we &apos;re gonna take good care of your boy , ma &apos;am .
we need pierce back in here !
they &apos;ve got him , mrs. gibson . pete &apos;s a tough kid .
what are you doing ?
there &apos;s a trauma .
i didn &apos;t page you .
amelia , i &apos;m here to help you . let me help .
you &apos;re the boss . i &apos;ll do whatever you need .
you want to help ? take my aneurysm .
o.r. four -- go clip it .
and there it is . that pause .
the one that means , &quot; i don &apos;t want the boring aneurysm ,
i want the big , exciting neuro trauma . &quot;
you don &apos;t do second place .
i do now . i &apos;m clipping an aneurysm .
we have an audience out there .
i know . starting cardiac massage .
hang another unit of blood on the rapid infuser .
right away .
come on .
come on , pete . give me something .
give me anything .
i have a heartbeat .
got a pulse .
there he is .
what &apos;s the story ?
traumatic arrest .
down for 14 minutes .
pupils are fixed .
no .
we lost him ?
no corneal reflex , either .
i &apos;ll do a formal exam in six hours ,
but someone needs to prepare the family .
he &apos;s most likely brain dead .
i &apos;m sorry .
we lost him .
pete &apos;s body is still strong ,
but i &apos;m afraid his brain
has been deprived of oxygen for too long .
he won &apos;t wake up ?
no .
i &apos;m afraid he &apos;s brain dead .
mrs. gibson , i am so sorry for your loss .
and brett ?
he &apos;s still in surgery .
and he &apos;s gonna be okay ?
he &apos;s stable now .
we &apos;re taking care of him as best we can .
who would do this to them ?
okay , blood in the abdomen .
possible liver injury .
turn him on three . one , two , three .
no visible wounds on his back .
looks like a bullet &apos;s lodged near his spine .
page neuro ! tell them to meet us in the o.r.
bailey , there &apos;s a cop asking about this --
oh , my god , how old is he , 15 ?
too young to be playing with guns .
this kid was really shooting at cops ?
but he &apos;s the driver , according to the police .
alleged driver .
can i tell him anything ?
tell him he &apos;s still alive , for now .
notify o.r. six we &apos;re on our way up with an emergency ex @-@ lap .
right away .
awesome !
what did i tell you ? pretty cool , right ?
questions ?
me ! me ! me ! i do !
i got a marble stuck in my nose once .
that &apos;s ... not a question .
gross .
are you sure this is okay ?
yeah , it &apos;s totally fine .
we got the nail out .
&quot; we &quot; ? you pulled that nail out of a guy &apos;s head ?
i did .
wow . so , you &apos;re kind of a badass , huh ?
i am .
okay , next slide .
and this is a coffee can in a man &apos;s abdomen .
cool !
that &apos;s disgusting .
okay , now that is ...
that &apos;s definitely not appropriate .
it &apos;s totally fine . we got the can out , too .
s @-@ sure , yeah .
but they &apos;re gonna ask how it got in there .
okay , guys , bus is here . let &apos;s roll out .
what is that ?
it &apos;s a coffee can .
all right . let &apos;s go , guys . come on .
dang , just when we were starting to have fun .
bye ! bye .
hey . hey . i thought amel--
uh , i was looking for the other dr. shepherd .
she &apos;s busy with the trauma .
did you talk to her ?
i did .
and ?
i &apos;m clipping an aneurysm for her .
huh . and you &apos;re good with that ?
what do you mean ?
well , it &apos;s a far cry
from mapping the brain for the president .
she &apos;s been talking to you .
a bit .
i &apos;m good with it . actually , i &apos;m a little nervous .
you sure you want to tell me that ?
no , i mean , it &apos;s a good nervous , uh , good , excited .
i just haven &apos;t operated in months , and ...
it feels really good to be back .
well , we &apos;re glad to have you back .
hey , hunt . we should hang out more .
do you fish ?
never . never have .
you should . we will .
okay .
all right . okay .
the bullet &apos;s nicked the bone , but there &apos;s no cord damage .
i &apos;d say leave it . your call .
mm , this liver &apos;s in bad shape . it &apos;s actually avulsed .
the blood supply &apos;s completely gone .
a kid this young helps commit robbery ?
he &apos;s not much older than tuck .
aw , damn it .
no , there &apos;s no saving this liver .
he &apos;s gonna need a transplant and fast .
so , someone doesn &apos;t get a liver because this shooter gets one ?
he won &apos;t survive without one .
and we don &apos;t know if this boy even had a gun on him .
please .
if he didn &apos;t shoot a cop , he was an accessory to someone who did .
he &apos;ll be tried as an adult .
hey , he &apos;s a patient .
we don &apos;t pay attention to the backstory .
we don &apos;t know anything about him .
we know we lost a cop today .
and we know he chose
to help his friends hold people up at gunpoint .
you do that , you pretty much get the hand you &apos;re dealt .
pack him and aggressively resuscitate .
then leave him here with a scrub nurse .
and you go find his family .
i &apos;ll call unos .
all right .
first things first .
i checked on your partner , brett .
he &apos;s still in surgery .
minimal internal injury .
they &apos;re still working on the trachea repair ,
but it didn &apos;t hit any of the major blood vessels ,
which is really great news .
thank you .
that &apos;s ... thanks .
now you .
you aren &apos;t going to need surgery , just a splint ,
but it does mean that you &apos;ll need to stay off of it
for at least six weeks , maybe eight .
you think that means one week , i can tell .
but it means six . at least , okay ?
after today , you know ,
i think i might want to ride a desk for a while .
after 14 years on the force , this is the first time
i ever had to fire my weapon on duty .
first time we were ever fired at .
well , it sounds like it was a good run .
i &apos;m sorry it ended .
thank you .
any word on the kid ?
uh , no . still in the o.r.
okay .
i just need something good to come out of this day .
abdominal injuries are under control .
i &apos;m ready to close . you about done , kepner ?
almost . then i &apos;ll let wilson close .
thank you , dr. kepner .
okay , update me when you &apos;re done .
he &apos;s de @-@ satting .
what is it ?
uh , it &apos;s not me .
field is clear . there &apos;s no bleeders .
nothing here . tube &apos;s intact . no leaks .
check his pupils .
no response .
oh , damn it . damn it , damn it , brett .
did he throw a clot ?
we won &apos;t know until we get him up to c.t.
page neuro , ask them to meet us post @-@ op .
right away .
we had him .
we had him .
i &apos;m so sorry , mrs. gibson .
brett &apos;s gone .
i knew this could happen .
i &apos;m afraid brett suffered a large stroke during surgery .
unfortunately , it &apos;s not uncommon .
in this case , the damage was very severe ,
and it resulted in brain death .
mrs. gibson , there was nothing anyone could do .
but his hand is still warm in mine .
his heart &apos;s beating . i can see his breath .
i woke up this morning the mother of two perfect children .
happy , proud .
and now ...
i just don &apos;t understand .
very sorry , mrs. gibson .
oh , god .
hey , how &apos;s he doing ?
pressure &apos;s dropping , and he &apos;s oozing from his drains .
well , unos didn &apos;t have anything available .
neither did any of the hospitals here or in oregon .
did you track down his family ?
oh , he &apos;s in the system .
his latest foster parents haven &apos;t seen him
since the night he came to stay with them , though ,
so , uh , they &apos;re not exactly racing down here .
so he &apos;s alone ?
and he &apos;s just gonna die here , alone .
how much time do we have ?
well , without a liver , he &apos;s got ...
hours .
ben , stay with him .
keep his sbp above 100 .
where you going ?
well , i @-@ i @-@ i just can &apos;t go to sleep tonight
knowing i didn &apos;t try absolutely everything .
god , i mean , how did this happen ?
this day started out so great .
&quot; blessed , &quot; i think you said .
now i have to go ask the mom for her son &apos;s organs .
that sucks .
is this how it has to be ?
if i &apos;m that happy , someone else has to be that unhappy ?
i mean , this poor cops &apos; mom lost two sons today .
what ? two sons ?
stroke .
on the table .
oh , god .
okay , you have to tell their commanding officer .
he &apos;s been asking for good news all day .
sure , i &apos;ll go talk to him
as soon as i &apos;m done asking the mom
if we can cut up her hero sons for body parts .
which , what time is it ?
those organs will be dead soon , too .
also , the commanding officer keeps asking
about the kid they brought in .
i think it &apos;s &apos; cause he just wants to hear that he &apos;s dead .
can you blame him ?
i showed a bunch of school kids
that x @-@ ray of a coffee can stuck up some guy &apos;s butt .
riveting .
alex .
read the room , man .
i was just trying to cheer you up .
oh , grey , um , is your patient an organ donor ?
i &apos;m about to go ask her now .
oh , when ? now ?
&apos;cause , you know , there &apos;s a window .
i know , bailey . i know .
and i have a 15 @-@ year @-@ old boy open in the o.r. ,
who needs a liver ,
and unos is coming up empty .
15 @-@ year @-@ old ? you &apos;re not talking about --
i checked your patient , and he &apos;s a perfect match .
and we can do it today ,
if the mother would consider a directed donation .
are you serious ?
okay , all i &apos;m asking is that you bring it up with her .
just ask .
no !
he will not survive without a new liver .
bailey , asking for her sons &apos; organs is hard enough .
now you want me to ask her for organs
to give to the kid that killed her sons ?
okay , take away the story .
right , take away the good guys and bad guys .
it &apos;s a child who needs an organ
and a patient with one to give .
bailey , that woman lost everything today .
i know !
okay , you don &apos;t think i know that ?
but ethically , you have to .
ethically , i &apos;m looking out for the best interest
of my patient and his family .
hey , thanks for walking us out .
you know , you didn &apos;t have to do that .
with your sense of direction , i kind of did .
that &apos;s ...
that is absolutely true .
i know it &apos;s been a drag for you ,
but i really appreciate it .
you really did make it fun , so thank you .
well , thank you .
yeah , so--
where &apos;s julie ?
what ?
i can &apos;t find julie .
she &apos;s not on the bus . have you seen her ?
no .
oh . wait , julie is the one who --
who was asking about the policeman .
that julie .
she was just right here , wasn &apos;t she ?
julie ?
hey , don &apos;t worry . we &apos;ll find her .
we &apos;ll find her , ma &apos;am .
i know this is a difficult time
and it &apos;s the last thing you &apos;d want to think about ,
but you do have a decision to make .
do you know if your sons
would have considered becoming organ donors ?
they were always helping people , even as little boys .
that &apos;s why they wanted to be policemen .
well , brett did .
pete -- he was always a little mixed up .
he just followed brett ,
but then he -- he found his way .
i think that ... that &apos;s what they &apos;d want .
i think they &apos;d want to help .
okay .
there &apos;ll be some paperwork to fill out .
uh , mrs. gibson ?
sure .
it is possible for you to designate
where you want your son &apos;s liver to go .
uh , specifically , i have a young patient --
he &apos;s only 15 -- desperately in need of a liver .
he &apos;s a perfect match with your son brett .
oh , god .
so young . that &apos;s terrible .
and you think brett could help that boy ?
he could .
you could .
15 ? mm .
what happened to him ?
well , he -- mm , was -- was injured in the robbery .
wait , you &apos;re not saying --
okay , mrs. gibson , uh , i @-@ i understand
it &apos;s an impossible question ,
but we need to ask --
no , he -- he murdered my boys .
you have the audacity to walk in here
and ask me to give him my child &apos;s body ,
my child &apos;s blood , so he can live ?
no , he &apos;s not getting anything .
he can go to hell .
grey , well , i had to try for my --
for your patient , i know .
but now that &apos;s dozens of transplant patients
that you just screwed out of a chance .
what happened ?
my daughter &apos;s missing .
i knew we should have gone home immediately .
ma &apos;am , just try and stay calm , okay ?
is she the kind of kid who wanders off ?
no .
no . what if someone took her ?
do you think someone took her ?
now , look -- we took a class picture this morning .
this is her .
this is what she &apos;s wearing .
i &apos;ll send this out to my guys ,
and we &apos;ll track her down , okay ?
edwards , have the paging system call for her .
you know what the girl looks like .
start checking the floors , room by room .
okay .
julie hamilton , julie hamilton ,
please report to ...
and he &apos;s so cute .
and he &apos;s incredible with the kids .
really ? seems like he wouldn &apos;t have lost one , then .
no , no , you should have seen him
when she actually went missing -- he stepped up .
and -- well , he might be a little young for me , though .
well , better than too old .
and can i really date a teacher ?
why not ?
he gets off work at 3 : 00 p.m .. i get off work at 3 : 00 a.m.
when will we have time to --
steph , stop . stop !
this isn &apos;t shirtless cat guy on the internet .
stop looking for reasons not to like the nice , cute guy .
you &apos;re hot for teacher .
let it happen .
i &apos;m gonna let it happen .
is there any hope ?
i &apos;m afraid not .
we &apos;ll observe them for the next six hours ,
but there &apos;s no brain activity at all .
how &apos;s their mom ?
she is going to need all the support you can give her .
thank you .
okay .
what about the kid ?
jared ?
listen , dan , i know you &apos;re angry ,
and i know that you need to know ,
but we can &apos;t talk about a suspect &apos;s condition ,
not legally .
i &apos;m not looking to settle a score , okay ?
i knew this kid .
brett knew this kid .
we put him in juvie .
we got him into the foster system .
we tried .
jared &apos;s one of those kids , you know .
he &apos;s smart . he &apos;s funny .
he &apos;s just susceptible to bad things , bad choices , bad kids .
brett would have called this his moment .
what &apos;s his moment ?
he called it -- he called it the moment --
when a kid would back themselves into a corner ,
when it would hit the fan so bad ,
that there &apos;s no other choice but to turn it around ,
wind up in lockup , or dead .
brett would say , &quot; that &apos;s when you can get them , dan .
that &apos;s when you can turn them around . &quot;
and this would have been it for jared .
and brett would have been here to help .
so , derek &apos;s back .
is that a question ?
no , it &apos;s just ...
and i &apos;m glad , i am , for you and the kids ,
and i don &apos;t want to make this all about me .
it &apos;s just --
he says he wants to come back and just work -- for me .
still not sure what you &apos;re asking .
well , i &apos;m asking should i believe that ?
can i believe that ?
i do .
you do .
yeah , he &apos;s different .
i don &apos;t know how to explain it ,
but ... i think he realizes what makes him happy ,
and he &apos;s choosing it .
and that makes me happy .
i think this is his moment .
grey , what did you call me for ?
&apos;cause if you just want to yell at me some more ...
nope .
i think i just got that kid his liver .
jared is prepped and ready , still in o.r. six .
thank you .
and thank you , officer gibson .
here &apos;s your second chance , jared .
okay , first kidney is out .
julie hamilton , julie hamilton ,
please report to any hospital personnel member immediately .
you see that ?
yeah . that &apos;s really ...
well , there you are .
am i in trouble ?
you know , you &apos;re not really supposed to be up here .
i saw that man in the e.r.
he was bleeding .
yeah , the doctors worked really hard to try to save him .
but he died .
so they &apos;re taking all his parts out ?
he &apos;s a donor ,
so his body is gonna help save lives
of people who need organs to live .
my grandpa had a heart transplant once .
will she give his heart to someone else ?
yes , she will .
i want to do that .
be a donor ?
no .
the doctor .
i want to do what she &apos;s doing .
that &apos;s my wife . see the lead surgeon ?
and right now she &apos;s making sure
that the artery to the kidney
is long enough to attach to someone else .
how did she learn all of that ?
she went to school a lot and practiced .
and she &apos;s just ...
... really great .
i think that &apos;s what i want to be .
feels good , doesn &apos;t it ?
knowing what you want to do next .
thank god , julie !
hey , baby .
that boy &apos;s alive ?
he is .
because of my son ?
that boy and the 37 others that were in the bank today --
37 people got to go home to their families today
because of your sons .
now , i would have called that a pretty good day &apos;s work .
but , grey ...
this is a list of 100 people who all got second chances today
because of your sons .
now , they won &apos;t know who to thank ,
so i would like to say thank you .
they were good boys .
okay , here we are .
i &apos;ll just put on the brakes .
all right .
okay , ready ? one , two , three .
oh . good .
all right , looks good .
use the crutches .
i know you won &apos;t think you need them , but do it .
it &apos;ll heal faster .
thank you , dr. torres .
for everything .
oh , i &apos;m --
i &apos;m so sorry about your friends , officer pruitt .
thanks .
hey , listen , um ...
never mind .
no , no , no . what is it ?
well , it &apos;s just that if today weren &apos;t ...
today .
if it was any other day , like , you know , a regular day ,
i &apos;d ask you if you &apos;d like to have dinner with me .
it &apos;s like -- it &apos;s like i said , you know ,
i just needed something to come out of this day right .
um , well , i will need to see you back here
in , um , 10 days for a follow @-@ up on that leg .
10 days ?

sounds like a plan .
that is a plan .
all right . see you in 10 days .
nick .
dr. edwards .
glad i get the chance to say goodbye .
better make it quick , though .
i &apos;m not letting this kid out of my sight again .
oh , son of a --
wait , wait , hang on . before you run off .
uh , i could be totally off base here ,
but you and i maybe had s--
would you like to maybe hang out sometime ?
wait , really ?
yeah , yeah , i mean -- i mean , you &apos;d really want to ?
yeah . i would .
uh , we could grab a drink or something .
oh , i @-@ i can &apos;t drink . i &apos;m ...
oh , okay . then coffee .
coffee &apos;s great .
yeah , i &apos;m all about the coffee .
perfect .
cool .
well , i &apos;m free friday night .
i @-@ i can &apos;t . friday &apos;s the junior prom .
you chaperone high @-@ school events , too ?
no , i @-@ i go to them .
17 years old ? !
could you maybe not scream it like that ?
oh , my god . i can &apos;t -- i can &apos;t breathe .
i know i told you to expand your horizons ,
but oh , my --
it was his little sister &apos;s class .
he said he was doing this teacher @-@ helper @-@ volunteer thing .
thought it would look good on his college applications .
i &apos;m gonna need many more of these .
thanks for doing this for me .
these two will look as good as they possibly can
before their mother sees them one last time .
though , it &apos;s taking a little longer than i expected .
you okay ?
yeah .
yeah ?
yeah . i &apos;m fine .
this is totally something sloan would &apos;ve done .
really ?
you know , he really did treat me like a son .
passed everything on .
he got such a charge out of it , the plastics posse .
it got a little goofy sometimes , honestly , but ... mm @-@ hmm .
i want to do that .
you know , pass it on to someone , the way he did for me .
whatever .
i don &apos;t know if i &apos;m making any sense .
it makes a lot of sense .
whew . it &apos;s cold out here .
it &apos;s quiet out here .
ever since you &apos;ve been back , you guys have been reconnecting .
vigorously .
you should have built thicker walls .
you okay ?
what do you mean ?
i didn &apos;t want to ask you ,
and i &apos;m not supposed to big @-@ brother you .
and you don &apos;t need me to .
there was a robbery , two shootings ,
and you declared two men dead .
i kept thinking about dad .
i wanted to know if you &apos;re okay .
i &apos;m happy for you .
that you &apos;re back .
that you &apos;re making it work .
that you &apos;re not running .
what do you mean , &quot; running &quot; ?
hey , i am not judging .
we are runners .
i ran from my engagement . you ran from addison .
i think ...
after dad ...
... if something scares us , we sprint fast as we can .
but you turned around this time .
that &apos;s something .
i &apos;m inspired .
open your eyes .
take a good look around you .
did mom tell you i went to go see her ?
no .
wow . how did that go ?
she said i was tired and miserable , which i was .
told me to get it together .
no sympathy .
oh , no , never .
she said , &quot; derek , take a good , hard look at your life .
if it &apos;s not working , shut up and fix it . &quot;
how &apos;s the view ?
do you like what you see ?
amy , i &apos;ve been missing out on everything in my life .
i mean , i &apos;m watching my kids grow up on a computer .
i don &apos;t want to miss my family .
i don &apos;t want to miss another second .
i want to coach soccer , go to ballet recitals .
i don &apos;t need to change the world .
clipping aneurysms , stopping bleeds --
that &apos;s the fun .
that &apos;s changing the world with our hands .
think back again to when you were little .
when did that stop being enough ?
saving someone &apos;s life ?
are you living the life you pictured for yourself ?
that &apos;s more than enough .
i &apos;m glad you &apos;re back .
me too .
i think i &apos;m falling in love with owen hunt .
and i &apos;m really afraid that it &apos;s gonna destroy me .
it wouldn &apos;t be love if it didn &apos;t .
or are you still dreaming of something even bigger ?
