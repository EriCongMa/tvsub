what are you doing ?
shh .
one of the smoke alarms is chirping .
i &apos;m trying to figure out which one it is
so i can change the battery .
well , if anybody can find it it &apos;s you .
you s @-@ sound horrible .
why don &apos;t ... why don &apos;t you go back to bed ?
&apos;cause i &apos;ve got too much to do .
i &apos;ve got to make the ladyfingers for the bake sale ,
and i &apos;ve got to go by the gym --
i left my phone there yesterday .
i &apos;ll do all that .
we &apos;re a team .
when one of us is weak , we lean on the other .
honey , you don &apos;t have to do that stuff .
honey , with all you do for me ,
including going to the gym four times a week
to keep me interested , i got this .
don &apos;t you have houses to show today ?
they ... canceled .
ohh , pumpkin .
are you kidding me ?
it &apos;s ... lucky .
this way i get to stay here and take care of you .
okay .
hey !
hey , mr. and mrs. dunphy .
hey .
is haley ready for school ?
she &apos;s on her way down .
don &apos;t get too close to my wife .
haley told you about that ?
it &apos;s just a dream .
oh , god .
okay , that came from the kitchen .
i @-@ i thought it was in here .
really ?
okay , you wait in here and listen for it .
i &apos;m gonna wait in there .
i mean , it &apos;s the least i can do ...
after ... well , you know .
i &apos;m coming with you .
boy , i wish haley would date some other boys .
what &apos;s that you say , mrs. robinson ?
don &apos;t .
i just feel like she owes it to herself
to see what else is out there .
the way that dylan &apos;s always hanging around here ,
he &apos;s probably gonna try to marry her
the second she turns 18 .
hey , you never know .
maybe those two were meant to be together ...
like we were .
honey , haley and dylan are not us .
no , i think that amount will be fine .
i &apos;m just happy you want lily .
i @-@ i think you &apos;re gonna be very happy with her .
okay . oh !
cam ? did you just sell our baby ?
no , but do you remember that agent we met
that represents child actors ,
the one who said lily might have what it takes
and gave us his card ?
yeah , that i threw away .
that i fished out of the trash ?
that was him on the phone they &apos;re shooting
a children &apos;s @-@ furniture @-@ store commercial today ,
and they want lily !
look , i threw away that card for a reason .
come on , it &apos;ll be fun ,
and lily will be on tv ,
and we can put the money in her college account .
no , let &apos;s just let our daughter
have a normal childhood , huh ?
i think that gay cruise has sailed .
it &apos;s just one commercial .
i don &apos;t like it .
no . no .
oh , what , so that &apos;s it ?
you &apos;re the parent with the final say ?
why is that ? because you make the money ?
it &apos;s not about that , and you know it .
i wouldn &apos;t expect you to understand us .
you &apos;re not theater folk .
neither are you .
you did &quot; godspell &quot;
one summer in a barn .
you &apos;re barn folk .
get used to that jealousy , lily .
ordinary people just don &apos;t understand us .
dennis to shipping and receiving .
dennis to shipping and receiving .
hola , jack .
hey ! what are you guys doing here ?
manny had a doctor &apos;s appointment ,
so we &apos;re gonna catch lunch with jay -- is he there ?
yeah , he &apos;s in back .
okay .
good day , jackson .
good day , manuel .
i see you &apos;re still forklifting .
more like lifting the fork .
man , i was gonna say that joke !
i &apos;m sorry , but i gotta have lunch with my wife today .
i know , baby , but i had to marry her
so she could stay in the country .
oh , no !
where am i gonna find another husband
that wears sweatpants to work ?
resort wear .
maybe last resort .
listen , i &apos;m glad you guys step by for lunch ,
&apos;cause you know what ?
i got to work a little late tonight .
no , not tonight . did you forget our date ?
no ! no . i was kidding !
i had no idea what she was talking about .
gloria @-@ god love her --
likes to celebrate every possible milestone
in our relationship --
day we met ...
our first date --
which i forgot , so we got in a big fight .
now we commemorate the big fight .
i thought we could re @-@ create the day .
do everything that we did the first time .
so romantic .
you know , that &apos;s exactly what i was thinking .
jack is so nice . i think he really likes manny .
what he likes is getting out of work .
wait a minute . is that manny driving ?
is it ?
yeah , it &apos;s him .
ay , my poor papi . two doctors in one day .
mom , i &apos;m fine .
the hospital said i could go back to school .
no , you suffered a traumatic experience .
i barely remember it !
i remember crashing through the wall
and the ambulance ride to the hospital .
that wasn &apos;t an ambulance . i drove you .
then what was that siren ?
that was your mother .
i was not that loud .
cars pulled over , honey .
jay , i &apos;m sorry about your wall .
wasn &apos;t your fault , was jack &apos;s ,
and i &apos;ve already taken care of him .
you killed him ?
you can &apos;t kill people here .
i fired him .
but it was just an accident !
he didn &apos;t mean it !
the guy &apos;s a screw @-@ up .
should have been gone months ago .
can &apos;t we just give him another chance ?
what is this &quot; we &quot; ?
let me explain something to you people .
here in this family , it &apos;s we .
at work , it &apos;s me .
my rules , my decisions ... period .
that &apos;s not fair !
you mad at me , too ?
no . you &apos;re right .
it &apos;s your work .
besides , i can &apos;t be mad at you --
not on our special day .
honey , i was thinking --
with what happened to manny ,
maybe we better postpone our special day
until next weekend .
no . next weekend is the anniversary
of the first time that i cooked for you .
what you doin &apos; , typhoid clairey ?
hey . what are you doing home ?
she caught your cold and had to come home .
i thought we should contain you two
and keep it from spreading through the house .
come here . i &apos;m so sorry .
it &apos;s okay .
hey , did you finish my ladyfingers ?
not yet .
did you pick up my phone from the gym ?
not yet .
is that the smoke detector ? i thought you fixed that .
boy , you &apos;re really starting the sound like your own self .
you know what this reminds me of ?
when you were little
and we used to snuggle and watch soap operas together .
remember that ?
nothing &apos;s changed .
sonya &apos;s still married to that guy .
one second .
the one with the ... bad hairline .
dylan ?
o ... kay .
god , i miss you , too .
oh , it &apos;s just a cold , silly .
you don &apos;t have to conceive of a world without me .
oh , nothing . i &apos;m just in bed with my mom .
stop freaking out . it is not coming true .
uh , mrs. vaughn ? it &apos;s phil dunphy .
it &apos;s about 3 : 30 .
now , i know you said you &apos;d moved on ,
but , um , there &apos;s been a significant price reduction
in the , uh , house in sullivan canyon ,
which i know you loved .
so , uh , if there &apos;s any chance you might reconsider ,
i know you will not be sorry .
i can meet you anytime , so just give me a call .
any -- anytime . i can meet you wherever that ...
... place is that you feel , uh , that would be best .
okay , thank you . bye .
dad ?
hey , buddy !
how are ya ? w @-@ what are you doin &apos; ?
keeping the germs off me .
you care about germs ?
i &apos;ve seen you kiss a pigeon on the mouth .
my class is going to disneyland in two days .
i can &apos;t get mom &apos;s cold .
good plan .
i remember this .
my dad bought it during the cuban missile cisis .
i never got a turn in that . you think maybe later i could --
yeah , maybe .
what are you doing home in the afternoon ?
oh , no big deal .
just had a couple of showings fall through .
again ?
you know what i always say .
sure do .
can &apos;t get back on that horse unless you fall off .
that &apos;s right .
that &apos;s loud .
sorry .
where is that coming from ?
changing the battery in a smoke detector
is what they teach you in man 101,
so , of course , every time i hear that noise ,
all i hear is , &quot; beep beep -- you &apos;re not a man .
beep beep -- you &apos;re not -- &quot;
really ? !
hey , dad . can you open this for me ?
oh . sure , buddy .
what happened ?
i broke a nail .
mitchell ! what &apos;s up ?
what do you -- what do you mean ?
you -- you just sent me an urgent text ,
saying to come right over .
that was from me , i used jay &apos;s phone .
oh , what happened to your face ?
oh , just a little scrape @-@ up .
mitchell , i &apos;d like to engage your legal services
in representing my friend jack
in a wrongful @-@ termination suit .
forget it . he &apos;s not coming back .
don &apos;t take the case , mitchell .
i @-@ i don &apos;t think i was gonna take the case .
fine . then , under the circumstances ,
we have nothing further to talk about .
these will be my last words to you .
knock knock .
who &apos;s there ?
okay , you got me .
i hope you feel clever tricking your kid .
hello , mitch !
hi , gloria .
congratulations !
on what ?
lily &apos;s commercial .
oh , no , no . we turned that down .
are you sure ?
because cam sent me a picture of her in her makeup chair .
uh , sorry . he what ?
oh , it &apos;s so exciting .
you have to remember this day
so that you can celebrate it every year .
okay , folks , we &apos;re about 10 minutes from shooting !
is talent ready ?
yes , uh , she sure is .
did you hear that , lily ? you &apos;re the talent .
isn &apos;t that magical ?
grapes .
and that is a prop .
okay , we &apos;re really gonna hang up this time .
on the count of three .
ready ?
1 , 2 , 3 .
hello ?
i can &apos;t believe he hung up !
i &apos;m calling him back .
hey , give me that .
oh , my god . is that jesse ?
and he &apos;s still married to angie .
you know something else you might find interesting ?
sonya is drinking ,
because she married a buffoon when she was young ,
and now she realizes she &apos;s wasted her entire life .
can you imagine making a mistake like that ?
yeah , that must be ... horrible .
yeah , now she &apos;s just a bitter ghost of a woman ,
filled with resentment .
but that &apos;s what happens when you commit to someone
before you see what else is out there .
seriously ? !
she couldn &apos;t have laid it on thicker .
&quot; ghost of a woman &quot; ? &quot; total buffoon &quot; ?
i &apos;m not an idiot .
she was talking about her and my dad !
yeah , well , maybe sonya and her husband
just need to ... work a little harder .
can he give her those years back ?
i mean , she could have been something .
she could have traveled the world ,
been with fascinating men .
she could have accomplished things .
that &apos;s all she thinks about now ...
every time she looks at him .
is that mom &apos;s apron ?
it &apos;s an apron . it &apos;s unisex .
some of the world &apos;s greatest chefs are men .
but it &apos;s bumped out where the boobs go .
that &apos;s happening more and more .
hadn &apos;t noticed .
mrs. vaughn !
thanks for calling back .
yeah , i was just about to ...
i see . uh , is there anything i can say that will
all right . well , thank you very much .
and if -- o @-@ okay . goodbye .
did you lose another one ?
hey . can &apos;t lose something you never had , right , pal ?
that was the doorbell , dad .
yeah , i know .
so , what happens if people stop buying houses ?
are we all gonna have to get jobs ?
just a little slump , buddy . nothing i can &apos;t handle .
hi , i &apos;m ron .
i work out with claire at the gym .
oh ! yeah . come on in .
i brought her phe back . she forgot it yesterday .
great . thanks .
i &apos;m phil , claire &apos;s husband .
oh . uh claire never mentioned she had a husband .
nice to meet you .
you too .
oh , sorry ! i burnt my ladyfingers .
so quiet .
it &apos;s like christian &quot; silence &quot; reading room .
i &apos;m fine .
so am i.
okay , my two stubborn burros . i &apos;m going out .
manny , be a good boy .
jay ...
mm , i &apos;ll see you later .
i think you know where .
honey ?
you know what i was just thinking ?
you know how when people are in love ,
sometimes they finish each other &apos;s sentences ?
like , um ...
tonight we &apos;re going to ...
have fun !
yes .
when we get to ...
... gether later !
you have no idea where you &apos;re going , do you ?
tell me .
hire jack back .
forget it .
your funeral .
okay , lily , daddy &apos;s gonna be right over here .
okay .
oh , and , um , by the way , if it helps ,
i have a list of things lily can do .
she can blow a kiss , uh , flap her arms like a bird ...
thank you . i &apos;ll ... keep at in mind .
okay . thank you .
cam . cam .
how did you get on theet ?
i walked on . it &apos;s not mgm .
it &apos;s a warehouse behind a mattress store .
i can &apos;t believe you went behind my back .
we agreed --
we didn &apos;t agree on anything .
you agreed .
we don &apos;t have to agree on everything .
i didn &apos;t like the book you bought her last week ,
but i didn &apos;t stop you from reading it to her .
well , what was wrong with it ?
how was it a big day for biscuit , mitchell ? how ?
okay , this isn &apos;t about biscuit .
i know . it &apos;s about our daughter , lily .
no , you want to know the truth ?
i think it &apos;s about you , cam .
i think you &apos;re using our daughter
to fulfill some childhood dream of yours .
okay . parents ...
we &apos;re ready to start rolling .
now , while we &apos;re doing the shoot ,
jim and deb here will be doing
the kids &apos; voice @-@ overs into the mike --
kind of like &quot; look who &apos;s talking . &quot;
oh . that &apos;s great .
there are a lot of important people here ,
so i &apos;m not gonna get mad ,
but i resent the implication that i would do anything
that &apos;s not in the best interest of our daughter .
okay , let &apos;s try a take !
and ... action !
oh , no !
we are lost in a city of high furniture prices !
ohh ! can no one protect us from these high prices ? !
cut ! lighting problem .
one sec .
you can apologize to me anytime you &apos;re ready .
are you kidding me ?
what ?
this commercial -- it &apos;s a big stereotype .
it &apos;s called &quot; ironic . &quot;
no , this is why lily was perfect -- she &apos;s asian .
she &apos;s a prop .
it &apos;s called &quot; niche casting . &quot;
stop telling me what stuff is called !
you &apos;re so blinded by the spotlight ,
you can &apos;t see what &apos;s really going on here !
let &apos;s go again !
all right . here we go .
let &apos;s roll , please !
action !
oh , no ! we are trapped in a city
of high furniture prices !
ohh ! can no one protect us from these high prices ? !
look !
over there !
it &apos;s save @-@ zilla !
he &apos;s knocking down prices on everything
from bibs to cribs !
half off on playpens !
high chairs are low chairs !
excuse me . excuse me .
excuse me ! excuse me . excuse me .
cut !
what &apos;s the problem ?
well , don &apos;t you think this commercial
just might be the teeniest bit racist ?
i mean , um , save @-@ zilla ?
it &apos;s not racist . it &apos;s satire .
no , i know , but maybe ...
maybe we could just tone it down a bit .
maybe not hit the accents so hard ?
this is the commercial you agreed to .
yeah , well , i know . i just ...
i can &apos;t let my daughter do this .
we had an agreement .
well , i also have the best attorney town ,
so do your worst .
and by the way ,
lily is vietnamese , not japanese .
there &apos;s a big difference ,
but you wouldn &apos;t know that ,
because you &apos;re only interested in seeing these children
as interchangeable stereotypes ,
not human beings .
come on , lily .
let &apos;s go .
cam ?
cam , that &apos;s not ...
hi , buddy .
there we go .
going to meet your mother .
figured it out all by myself .
two years ago , we got our marriage license ,
we went to a little hot dog stand .
she said was the most romantic meal
she ever had in her life .
that &apos;s it , isn &apos;t it ?
yeah , that &apos;s it .
get this into your head .
you can give me the cold shoulder the rest of your life .
jack &apos;s not coming back .
see , i could overlook the goofing off ,
but you could have been seriously hurt today .
anybody puts my kid in danger
doesn &apos;t get a second chance ever .
i &apos;ll see you later .
did you just call me your kid ?
oh , geez .
you &apos;ve never said that before .
sure i have .
well , of course you &apos;re my kid .
i mean , what do you think ?
you &apos;re going to the wrong place .
what ?
it &apos;s not your wedding license .
what is it ?
first kiss .
no . just tell me .
i mean , your first kiss with my mom .
my god , you &apos;re right .
thanks !
the pier .
thanks .
but maybe sonya didn &apos;t make a mistake .
maybe she just met her soul mate when she was young .
no , no , no . that never happens .
see , she threw her life away ,
and now she wants out .
okay , let &apos;s cut the crap .
we &apos;re not talking about some character
on a soap opera here , are we ?
no . no , we &apos;re not .
honey , i &apos;m sorry .
i don &apos;t want to hurt your feelings , but ...
i &apos;ve been feeling this way for a really long time ,
and ... can we be honest with each other ?
he &apos;s kind of a doofus .
i guess , but ...
i thought you liked that about him .
no , i never did .
believe me , honey .
there are many better options out there .
like who ?
i don &apos;t know .
off the top of my head , uh ...
how about that cute guy who delivers the pizzas ?
he &apos;s like 18 !
so ?
don &apos;t mind me , ladies .
this is the last one .
i &apos;ve changed the batteries
in every last smoke detector in the house .
hey , dad .
i think i found a place online where i can sell this organ .
can you drive me to the black market ?
i think they mean a different kind of organ , buddy .
sweetie , why are you trying to sell that ?
in case things with dad &apos;s job get even worse .
honestly , i don &apos;t know why
everybody &apos;s making such a big deal .
everything &apos;s fine .
it makes no sense !
i changed every one !
i &apos;m gonna call my dad .
no , we &apos;re not calling anyone !
i can handle this .
i just need the old burglar basher .
is that your college cheerleading baton ?
not when you &apos;re on the business end of it .
guess that one won &apos;t be chirping anymore , will it ?
honey ...
go after him .
oh , no , he just needs to blow off some steam .
how &apos;s that for battery ? !
mom , like it or not ,
you made a commitment ,
and maybe that doesn &apos;t mean anything to you anymore ,
but you owe it to this family to save your marriage
and give it one more try .
what ?
end of the line , smokey joe !
look , dad may be a doofus ,
but he is 10 times better than any pizza @-@ delivery boy .
go to him .
did you --
i just detected your ass gettin &apos; kicked !
okay .
honey ...
thought i forgot about you , didn &apos;t you ?
nope .
phil , no . stop .
i gotta stop the damn chirping .
this isn &apos;t about the noise .
sweetie ...
... you &apos;re having a bad day .
at the end of a bad month .
i know .
you know how scary that is , claire ?
no . no , i don &apos;t ,
because you never tell me the bad stuff .
you only share all the good stuff .
honey , what happened to us being a team ?
right ? we &apos;re supposed to lean on each other .
honey ...
i have faith in you .
i must be catching your cold .
okay .
you know what ?
let &apos;s just get new smoke detectors .
we already changed them out last year .
remember , buddy ? you helped me .
sure did .
wait a minute . what &apos;d you do with the old ones ?
you told me to throw them in the garbage ,
so i put them in the attic to make a robot .
it &apos;s the old ones .
the batteries are dying ,
and we can hear them through the vents .
you did it , buddy !
i &apos;m sorry .
i love you .
i love you .
i did that .
oh . that must be the pizza i ordered .
pizza ? you ordered pizza ?
yeah . i was just sort of in the mood , you know ?
but we had pizza a couple nights ago .
i know , but i had an urge ,
and when you get an urge , you get an urge .
okay , here , i &apos;ll get it !
no , sweetie , i &apos;ve got it .
no , mom . you &apos;re always asking me to do things .
i &apos;ll get it . here , just sit back , relax .
i &apos;ll get the pizza . don &apos;t worry .
i @-@ i ... really -- okay , get the change .
here !
