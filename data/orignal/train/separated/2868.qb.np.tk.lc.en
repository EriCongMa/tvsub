check it out , this is unbelievable !
joey &apos;s been holding his breath for almost four minutes .
you trying to kill me ?
i want to ask you something .
what ?
since i &apos;m moving out , and you &apos;re so beautiful ...
how about i move in with you ?
that would be great , but what do we do about denise ?
who &apos;s denise ?
my roommate .
your roommate ? yes , denise . denise !
what is with the secrecy , phoebe ? what about denise ? she cute ?
how can you have a roommate that we don &apos;t know about ?
because you never listen to what i say.i talk about her all the time . denise !
i &apos;m gonna have an extra room over at my place .
that &apos;s true .
move in with me .
we can stay up late talking , and watch movies .
you know about naked thursdays , right ?
yeah , yeah . i think i &apos;ll find my own place .
hey ! i thought naked thursdays was just our thing , man .
the one with ross &apos; denial
what did rachel say when you told her you were still married to her ?
oh , that.she took it really well .
you didn &apos;t tell her , did you ?
no .
because you &apos;re in love with her .
i am not in love with her . she was upset about having to move out .
if she knew we were still married , she &apos;d have been more upset .
so i comforted her . as a friend .
you &quot; comforted her &quot; ? nothing . i just gave her a hug .
a classic sign of love , the hug .
it &apos;s also a sign of friendship .
not in your case , &quot; lovey loverson . &quot;
it was a hug . okay ?
a simple hug .
i was a friend being a friend to a friend .
use the word &quot; friend &quot; more .
did you , or did you not , smell her hair ?
smell her hair ? what if i did ?
ninety percent of a woman &apos;s pheromones come out of her head .
that &apos;s why women are shorter.so that men will fall in love when they hug them .
come on , ross , you &apos;re a scientist .
i was hugging her as a friend .
it &apos;s not my fault her hair got in my face.she &apos;s got a lot of it , and it smells all ... all ...
coconutty .
what ? it doesn &apos;t mean i have feelings for rachel.maybe it means i have feelings for coconuts .
okay , whatever you say
but be careful . rachel &apos;s not in the same place you are .
if the place you &apos;re referring to is being in love ... she is in the same place as me ,
because i am not in that place .
i didn &apos;t understand that .
maybe that &apos;s because you were speaking the secret language of love .
a guy just called for you .
who was it ?
i don &apos;t know . how about &quot; thanks for taking the message &quot; ?
when you move in ... rachel &apos;s room will be empty .
let &apos;s talk about what to do with it .
i think we should have a beautiful guest room ...
with a mahogany sleigh bed and bedside tables with fresh flowers .
and comment cards so people could tell us how great their stay was .
i really haven &apos;t thought about it that much .
well , i like that idea ... obviously .
i was thinking maybe ... maybe it could be a game room .
you can buy old arcade games ,
like space lnvaders and asteroids for $ 200 . the real ones . the big , big , big ones !
no .
you mean &quot; no &quot; as in : &quot; gee chandler &quot;
&quot; what an interesting idea . let &apos;s discuss it before we reject it . &quot;
i &apos;m sorry.of course i mean that
interesting idea . talk about it , but no .
so that &apos;s it ?
i just don &apos;t think arcade games go in a beautiful guest room ...
the beautiful guest room is gonna be filled with antiques .
which is why asteroids is perfect . it &apos;s the oldest game .
what &apos;s wrong with a beautiful guest room ?
i &apos;m not against it.especially since everybody we know
lives about 30 seconds away .
are you mocking me ?
no , i &apos;m not mocking you or your beautiful guest room .
what &apos;s up
monica and l had a stupid fight .
you &apos;re still moving in together , right ? my ad came out today .
&quot; wanted : female roommate , nonsmoker , nonugly . &quot;
nice .
i figured it &apos;d be more interesting to have a female roommate .
someone i could learn from . someone who &apos;s different than me .
and what &apos;s more different than me , a guy who &apos;s not 19 ...
than a girl who is 19 ?
not just a hatrack , my friend .
phoebe , i have to ask you .. i &apos;m swamped right now .
you &apos;re just staring into space .
i &apos;m trying to move that pencil .
this one ?
lt worked !
phoebe , this whole apartment thing is a nightmare .
anything i can afford comes with a roommate who is a freak . look .
&quot; wanted : female roommate , nonsmoker , nonugly . &quot;
that &apos;s probably some 12 @-@ year @-@ old kid trying to get girls to call .
there &apos;s nothing . this city is full .
wait ! look at this !
&quot; two bedroom , two bath . must be nonsmoker . satan worshipers okay . &quot;
yeah , but it &apos;s on the ground floor .
rach , you still looking for a place ?
yeah , why ?
this guy , warren , from the museum is going on a dig for two years .
he &apos;s got this great place he needs to sublet . you interested ?
great ! i &apos;d love to live at warren &apos;s . i love warren !
oh , wait . is he the guy that asked you for naked pictures of me ?
that doesn &apos;t matter , he won &apos;t be there !
thank you !
don &apos;t thank me .
thank the volcano that erupted thousands of years ago ... killing , but perfectly preserving , an entire civilization .
here &apos;s warren &apos;s number .
this is great . i &apos;m gonna call him right now ! thank you !
okay , you go call him .
i saw it .
what are you talking about ?
i &apos;m talking about what you already know but won &apos;t admit .
you love her again . you re @-@ love her .
i do not re @-@ love her.i can &apos;t believe you won &apos;t just admit it .
promise me you won &apos;t do anything stupid .
we &apos;re just friends now . why would i do anything stupid ?
the apartment is already subletted.it &apos;s hopeless . i &apos;ll never find anything .
you can live with me.-what ?
what ? !
what ?
are you serious ?
i would love to live with you . that &apos;s great . thank you .
i &apos;m just glad i could help you out .
wow , i &apos;m so happy for you guys . this is so , so , not stupid .
ross , you have no idea what this means to me .
i was gonna be homeless . you just saved me . you &apos;re my hero .
hero ? i don &apos;t know . well , all right .
i have to go tell monica what a wonderful brother she has .
oh , please .
you &apos;re gonna say things now , aren &apos;t you ?
no . no , i won &apos;t.but i should tell you this .
the same thing happened to my roommate , denise .
she moved in with a guy who was secretly married to her.he said he didn &apos;t love her , but he really did .
and it just blew up.and that &apos;s how she ended up living with me .
okay , that &apos;s a lie .
you don &apos;t have a roommate .
denise !
no one ever listens to me !
listen , i &apos;m sorry about before . i don &apos;t need a game room .
i only played those games because i couldn &apos;t get girls .
now i can get ..
now i have you .
no , not that i think i have you ... or think of you as property in any sort of way .
i see women .... stop it , chandler .
i &apos;m sorry too .
really ?
yeah . oh , yes .
we can think of something to do with the room together .
great idea . we can easily think of a way for us both to enjoy the room .
totally .
we don &apos;t have to decide now .
good .
let &apos;s think about changes we can make in the living room .
changes ?
we &apos;ll have to move some furniture to make room for my chair .
you &apos;re bringing the barcalounger over here ? is that a problem ?
it &apos;s just that they &apos;re a set and should stay together .
that &apos;s cool . i &apos;ll bring them both over .
you &apos;re taking them away from their home .
i get it . i get nothing . nothing here is mine . everything is yours .
i &apos;ll get up in the morning , put on your clothes and go off to work !
yeah , that &apos;s it . everything will be mine . nothing will be yours .
i &apos;m talking about the barcalounger .
it doesn &apos;t match . where will it go ?
in the game room !
it is not my fault your chairs are incredibly ugly .
that &apos;s fine.i won &apos;t bring the chairs . i won &apos;t bring anything !
i wouldn &apos;t want to ruin the ambiance over here at grandma &apos;s place !
everything on your application looks really good.just one last question .
will your friends be over here , partying and hanging out ?
don &apos;t worry . i &apos;m not a party girl .
don &apos;t just be blurting stuff out.i want you to really think about your answers .
call off the roommate search . hi . i &apos;ll be living here .
ignore him . he &apos;s just some guy who wants the apartment.but he &apos;s not going to get it .
you took down the shower curtain ?
that thing was a hazard !
i &apos;m very safety conscious .
i was just clearing some space for your stuff.thanks.
but listen , monica and chandler had a big fight and they &apos;re not moving in .
what do you mean , not moving in ? they &apos;re still moving in , right ?
no , they just had a big blowout over what to do with my room .
over a stupid room ?
i feel kind of bad for them , but now i don &apos;t have to move in here !
oh , no . yeah , that part &apos;s great .
what &apos;s all this about you guys fighting ?
is this really over a room ? that is so silly .
we can handle this .
apparently not .
and i can &apos;t stand by and watch two people i care about so much be hurt by something that is so silly .
enough of the silliness .
tell her to stop being silly .
okay
two very good points .
i &apos;ve known you both a long time .
and i &apos;ve never seen either of you one @-@ millionth as happy as you &apos;ve been since you got together .
do you really want to throw that all away over a room ?
that is so silly .
what &apos;s more important , love ... or silliness ?
well , we are fond of the silliness.but we also have a soft spot for the love .
love is the best medicine .
that &apos;s &quot; laughter . &quot;
why do you do it ?
i don &apos;t know .
now , chandler , you want to live with monica , right ?
yeah , i do .
and , mon , you want to live with chandler ? yes .
good ! a verbal contract is binding in the state of new york !
so i understand you &apos;re looking for a place ?
no , i &apos;m staying put .
i was going to offer you my apartment .
why ? where you going ?
i don &apos;t know .
rachel
you won &apos;t believe it.monica and chandler are moving in again .
that &apos;s great news , right ? i mean , for them , right ?
but on the bright side , we get to be roommates again .
yeah . you know , about that ....
i really appreciate your offer to let me move in and everything ... but
don &apos;t you think it &apos;ll be weird ?
why ? why would it .... why would it be weird ?
well , you know , because of us.because of our history .
no ! no ,
no ! it would only be weird if we were still in &quot; that place . &quot;
are you still in that place ?
no , not at all .
good . me neither .
so it &apos;s not a problem.we &apos;re just two friends who happen to be roommates .
okay , but eventually you and i will be dating .
really ? we are ?
yeah . i &apos;ll have a boyfriend and you &apos;ll have a girlfriend .
that &apos;d be great .
but if you think it &apos;ll be okay , we &apos;ll just work out a system .
it &apos;ll be like in college . i &apos;ll hang a sign on the door :
&quot; come back later . i &apos;m getting lucky . &quot;
yeah , i didn &apos;t think of that .
so are you sure about this whole moving @-@ in thing ?
it &apos;s a really big step . and what &apos;s the rush ?
that &apos;s very funny .
he &apos;s being silly because he knows we enjoy the silliness .
no , i &apos;m serious . think about it . you move in .
you start fighting over game rooms . next thing you know , you break up .
it was just a stupid fight about a room .
there are no stupid fights !
this isn &apos;t about the room.this is about what the room represents .
and unfortunately , this room could destroy you !
i &apos;m not so worried .
me neither .
fine . it &apos;s your life !
i just don &apos;t want to see you break up.which you will do if you move in together .
but if that &apos;s what you want , there &apos;s nothing i can do .
don &apos;t do it !
you still want to move in together ?
of course .
ross didn &apos;t scare you ? scared me out of wanting to live with him .
i gotta show you something .
okay .
oh , my god ! someone &apos;s killed square man !
the barcalounger can go here .
you can see the tv , and it &apos;s still walking distance to the kitchen.oh , that &apos;s so sweet .
i want to show you something too .
you know those big road signs that say &quot; merge &quot; ?
i thought we could get one of those signs and hang it over our bed .
because that &apos;s you and i together . &quot; merge ! &quot;
i love that !
really ? &quot; no ! &quot;
i found you in my bed how &apos;d you wind up there ?
you are a mystery little black curly hair
little black , little black , little black ... little black curly hair
if you want to receive e @-@ mails about my upcoming shows ... please give me money so i can buy a computer .
where are the other guys ?
well , monica and chandler are occupied .
fighting ?
the other thing .
it &apos;s great they worked things out .
there &apos;s no breaking them up , is there ?
can i borrow the key to your house so i can go make a copy ?
here .
thank you .
are you sure ? once i make a copy , there &apos;s no turning back .
yeah , i &apos;m sure . now get out of here before i change my mind .
you think moving in with rachel is a good idea ?
i &apos;ve been back and forth .
well , maybe you should go back .
she moves in , and before you know it ... you &apos;re right where you don &apos;t want to be , back together
i don &apos;t think so . she &apos;s already talking about dating other guys .
that &apos;s not going to work out .
she &apos;ll come home all weepy ... and you &apos;ll be telling her ,
&quot; oh , that &apos;s okay . you &apos;ll find someone . &quot;
and then , bam ! she finds you !
maybe you &apos;re right .
ross , she is definitely gonna fall in love with you again.is that what you want ?
is that what i want ? yes .
here she comes . i &apos;m gonna make your life much easier .
the place was closed , so i &apos;ll copy it later.or not .
why don &apos;t you move in with me ?
whoa , joey !
look , i know i scared you with that whole naked @-@ thursdays thing ... but
we don &apos;t have to do that .
it would be easier to move across the hall .
unless you &apos;re thinking about naked wednesdays .
thursday &apos;s clearly not good for you . pick a day !
come on in . thanks for coming back .
there &apos;s a lot of people interested in the room.but i &apos;ve narrowed it down ,
and you &apos;re one of the finalists.-great !
before i decide ... i want to be sure our personalities match .
so i made up a little test .
i &apos;ll say a word , and you say the first thing that comes to mind .
i can do that .
okay , here we go .
pillow .
fight .
very good .
&quot; g. &quot; -string ?
excellent !
doggy .
kitten ?
sorry !
