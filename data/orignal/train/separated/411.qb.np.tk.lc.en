19 @-@ year @-@ old kate joyce an honour student
was vacationing at beach with friends
when she disappeared nearly 3 days ago .
atlantic beach detective bob mathias ...
they &apos;ve had suspects in custody the whole time but nothing .
can &apos;t even charge them with anything unless they find her body .
what are the chances of that ?
... but are cooperating with the investigation .
mathias says without a body ...
they &apos;re still in hotch &apos;s office huh ?
it can &apos;t be good .
... are suspected in her disappearance .
authorities only have 12 hours left
to hold the men in custody without an official charge .
jj &apos;s still in there ?
and strauss .
oh again with the dairy ?
i can &apos;t help it . i love dairy .
it &apos;s been like what 20 minutes ?
well 10 more minutes we &apos;re in the air .
i don &apos;t think it &apos;s about the case .
do you know something ?
do i know something ?
she just repeated the question.you always say that &apos;s a sign .
do you know why jj &apos;s in there ?
i have no idea .
what is going on ?
maybe she asked for a raise .
have his blinds ever been closed ?
i have given it thought . i &apos;m not interested .
clearly . you turned down the job twice
without consulting your unit chief .
agent jareau is under no obligation to discuss it with me .
if the pentagon calls one of your team members
you should know about it .
why didn &apos;t you tell agent hotchner
that you turned down the position ?
i never wanted it to get this far because--
because you know it &apos;s a better job .
because i don &apos;t want to leave this one .
you &apos;ve been here for 6 years .
nearly 7 ma &apos;am .
change is good .
and from what i understand there &apos;s less travel with this position .
you could stay home with henry .
excuse me ?
i understand the sacrifices .
i do what i love .
it &apos;s made me a better person a better mother .
any &quot; sacrifices &quot; i have made
have been for my family .
i don &apos;t have a single regret .
we &apos;re all in agreement that agent jareau &apos;s
a valuable part of this team
and it &apos;s understandable why the executive branch
is requesting a transfer .
however if agent jareau respectfully declines their request
there &apos;s no way you can make her go .
no i can &apos;t .
have you looked at the video of the missing girl ?
everyone &apos;s watching it now .
you &apos;re expected in maryland within the hour .
we &apos;ll be there .
thank you .
jj .
pentagon ?
sorry i didn &apos;t tell you .
it &apos;s ok . it &apos;s just-- it &apos;s a big deal .
a liaison for the department of defense--
it &apos;s a major promotion .
are you sure you don &apos;t want this ?
hotch i belong here .
you &apos;d think profilers would cover better than that wouldn &apos;t you ?
you read up on the suspects ?
presents like the typical dominant @-@ submissive
but i doubt it &apos;s that textbook .
well we only got one shot at this .
how long have they been in custody ?
60 hours . we have 12 hours to get a confession or find the body .
syd pearson has a lot of money and connections .
if we let him go we may never see him again .
and barrett ?
he doesn &apos;t have the same resources .
do you think these guys did it ?
the locals do .
they tried to get them to turn against one another
but that didn &apos;t work .
it seems they have a bond that dates back to childhood .
we only have a 30 @-@ minute flight .
that &apos;s not enough time to delve into their histories .
bullet points on the missing woman .
second and third pages are all about the suspects .
garcia we &apos;re gonna need phone records credit card receipts
anything you can find .
yes you &apos;ll have them when you get there .
thank you .
is everything ok ?
what you mean strauss ? don &apos;t !
i know that look . everything is gonna be fine .
jean racine said
&quot; a tragedy need not have blood and death .
it &apos;s enough that it all be filled with that majestic sadness
that is the pleasure of tragedy . &quot;
hey you ok ?
uh yeah . you ?
i just feel kind of sick . excuse me .
i got this offer from the pentagon.i turned it down twice .
i never told hotch or strauss .
and now strauss wants you to take it .
well of course she does .
it &apos;ll make her look good if you get promoted .
i don &apos;t trust her for a second .
you shouldn &apos;t . what does hotch think ?
he knows i don &apos;t want to go .
well then you won &apos;t .
penelope &apos;s pretty freaked out huh ?
you have to ask ?
ok let &apos;s review .
ok . kate joyce 19 years old
was last seen leaving a bar with these two men
sydney pearson and james barrett both 20 years old .
she was reported missing the next morning .
when she didn &apos;t make it to meet her friend .
that was almost 3 days ago .
their story is they dropped kate at the motel
but there were no cameras to confirm that .
and search and rescue &apos;s been all over the island .
dragged the inlet and they found absolutely nothing .
both said they had sex with kate .
they &apos;re claiming it was consensual .
there &apos;s no way to confirm . there &apos;s no body .
i doubt it was consensual .
we &apos;ve got to prove they &apos;re guilty
of more than just being seen with her .
the police weren &apos;t able to find any holes in their stories .
we &apos;re gonna have to break them down psychologically .
morgan i want you and prentiss to lead the interrogation .
dave you and reid start at the bar .
jj kate joyce &apos;s family is still at the station .
still ? for 3 days ?
they never went to the hotel .
i want you to stay with them .
yeah .
they haven &apos;t left .
the mayor personally set them up
with a penthouse suite at the harrison grand
but they won &apos;t go .
they can &apos;t . you &apos;re their only source of information .
to be even a minute away would add to their torture .
i &apos;ve kept them away from the suspects .
now i don &apos;t get why you want them together .
trust me .
you &apos;re from the fbi ?
yes ma &apos;am . jennifer jareau .
jj ?
kate was almost jennifer .
jennifer joyce . we would have called her jj .
would you two like to head to the hotel ?
i &apos;ll come with you .
we &apos;ll have constant contact with my team .
will those boys still be here ?
yes sir .
then so will i.
ok well let &apos;s find a place where we can talk .
come on .
hit the national news yesterday .
a lot of pressure .
the mayor would rather have a great white attacking
than a homicide .
sure . a shark attack makes the mayor a victim .
a killer makes him responsible .
once she got into that car
we have no idea what happened .
well the suspects &apos; stories hold up .
they &apos;ve told them dozens of times without variation .
there &apos;s got to be some truth in them .
syd pearson is a handful .
jimmy barrett is dumber than a box full of rocks .
but they &apos;ve been friends all their lives .
yeah go figure .
there &apos;s gotta be a reason .
well they &apos;ve only been out of their holding cells
to be interrogated or to use the john .
you &apos;ve got video ?
yeah we got cameras in both rooms .
good . we &apos;ll have to rely on nonverbal cues .
that &apos;ll expose their weaknesses .
hey you .
what &apos;d you do with kate ?
calm down man .
i will kill you you understand ?
you understand me ? !
keep them him from me .
barrett avoided conflict .
pearson was provocative .
the blond one &apos;s getting off on this .
well if he knows where kate is
that &apos;s his power .
hey can i get you anything ?
what ?
water ? soda ? are you hungry ?
starving .
anything .
tuggie &apos;s roast beef with fries .
the curly ones .
you got it .
and a beer .
nice try .
what the hell was that ?
just trying to establish some trust .
you gonna ask the other one too ?
no .
in other words you &apos;re not going in there .
not yet .
really ?
you know we don &apos;t have a whole lot of time here .
they &apos;ve been slammed with
the same questions for the last 2 and 1 / 2 days .
we go in there with that strategy we &apos;ll get nowhere .
i don &apos;t get it .
if we go in there now they have all the power .
so what we just wait ?
for a while .
kate joyce comes from a stable family .
she went to good schools got good grades
has good friends .
everything points to her being a total sweetheart .
you don &apos;t think she is ?
i &apos;m sure she is .
but ?
she &apos;s 19 .
everyone agrees--
kate wouldn &apos;t leave with those boys .
but she did .
yeah . but why ?
why would this girl this sweetheart
take such a risk ?
we don &apos;t have many images to go by .
we saw enough to know what happened .
kate joyce and her friends moved around a lot .
the suspects didn &apos;t .
they waited for her .
a sea of opportunity .
why was she drawn to those guys ?
what if she knew them ?
her friends never said that .
she was only here a week .
i think she trusted them .
why ?
she may have been testing her boundaries
but she &apos;s far too cautious to just go off with total strangers .
so she met them before friday night .
look at her .
has she always been a fish ?
we started her out in swim lessons
our second summer down here .
when was that jeff &apos; 95 ?
who &apos;s this ? your son ?
drew .
so they were on the same swim team
but he looks like he &apos;s a few years younger ?
was . he had leukemia .
i &apos;m so sorry .
katie was always very protective of him .
it hit her the hardest .
we should have been here . if we had driven down ...
then she wouldn &apos;t have come .
stop saying that .
it &apos;s the truth . the whole point
was for her to get away .
get away ?
from what patty ? from us ?
i don &apos;t know jeff .
she needed a break .
you shouldn &apos;t have let her come .
she &apos;s 19 years old .
how was i gonna stop her ?
and we said it was ok .
we were wrong .
god don &apos;t you think i know that ? !
i know you &apos;re trying to make sense of this .
trust me there is no logic to any of it .
no . you have no idea
no idea what it &apos;s like .
our children were taken from us !
and there is nothing you can say
that will change that .
you &apos;re right .
it &apos;s natural to want to blame someone .
but right now you really have to hold on to each other .
garcia what have you got ?
oodles of records .
cell phones credit cards
some juicy juvie .
sending details now .
it is safe to say these two have always been in trouble .
when did it start ?
the summer of 2000 .
they were only 10 . what did they do ?
see for yourself .
naughty boys .
shoplifting vandalism
burned a house down .
abandoned building . fireworks .
assault charges were dropped last summer .
well it looks like they bring out the worst in each other .
ready ?
what &apos;s up ?
what &apos;s up ?
my name &apos;s derek morgan .
i &apos;m with the fbi &apos;s behavioral analysis unit .
what did you do ?
oh i had this before friday night .
that &apos;s not what i asked you .
but i know what you &apos;re thinking .
i highly doubt that .
wow . division one lacrosse player .
obviously left @-@ handed .
broke it in 3 places .
ooh . that sucks .
i bet you &apos;re a force .
too bad you didn &apos;t dominate the way they hoped though .
why not ?
i mean what happened ?
were you still hung up on the chapel hill rejection ?
i mean especially after you told everybody that you were gonna go .
i mean damn that &apos;s gotta sting a little bit .
what &apos;s the deal ?
isn &apos;t it all in your little file ?
well let &apos;s see .
my little file says ...
you cheated on your sats
and you had your girlfriend take them for you .
that &apos;s another hard lesson isn &apos;t it ?
you can &apos;t trust anybody to keep their mouth shut .
why haven &apos;t you lawyered up ?
i haven &apos;t done anything wrong .
that is so annoying .
do you know anything about video cameras ?
the battery &apos;s probably dead .
oh .
hey guys . can i get a new uh
battery for the video camera ?
ok .
what is that roast beef ?
did anyone ask you ?
i &apos;m not hungry .
neither was i until i smelled that .
sorry .
ok . um ...
so syd has a lexus .
that &apos;s nice .
did he ever let you drive it ?
no .
yeah he &apos;s kind of a control freak huh ?
i met him . he seems like a jerk .
and it says a lot that he can eat at a time like this .
and he didn &apos;t just get a car .
he got a lexus .
at 16 .
but well i guess that &apos;s what lrbs get .
little rich boys .
his dad &apos;s got a dealership .
do you always defend syd ?
defend him ?
never mind .
so i see you have a boat .
single outboard motor two @-@ stroke engine .
is it fast ?
yeah .
25 ...
30 .
so when did your family move here ?
i don &apos;t remember .
grade school ? middle school ?
fifth grade .
so you were 10 .
that &apos;s the year you met syd .
how does any of this have to do with that girl ?
he never mentions her by name .
why not ?
he &apos;s distancing himself .
depersonalizing the victim .
you want to talk about kate ?
i didn &apos;t know her .
you brought her up .
see the way he shifted his weight and cracked his neck ?
his behavior was consistent until kate was mentioned .
your statement says that you and jimmy first met kate
on friday night .
these are kate &apos;s credit card receipts .
her and her friends rented a jet ski
from jimmy friday morning .
mm @-@ hmm . he gets 100 customers a day .
yeah but come on man .
i doubt they all look like kate now do they ?
isn &apos;t that really why jimmy texted you friday morning ?
woke you up and said hey man
you gotta get down here and see this girl .
and you liked what you saw didn &apos;t you ?
you invite her to the club
and maybe that would have been all right but the problem is
when you and jimmy get together it &apos;s nothing but trouble .
and when you add a girl to that mix
she didn &apos;t stand a chance did she ?
just like kelley graybeal .
who ?
last summer .
she filed a complaint but lucky for you
she dropped all the charges .
look man we could do this for another
i don &apos;t know whatever you got left .
or i could make it ...
real simple for you .
give me a polygraph .
after 65 hours of sitting in here you want a polygraph ?
well that depends .
on what ?
are you gonna ask me the questions ?
&apos;cause i was really hoping
you &apos;d send that pretty one back in here .
you guys hear that ?
barrett just asked for a polygraph .
you &apos;re kidding me . him too ?
i don &apos;t understand why those boys agreed to a polygraph .
they didn &apos;t . they suggested it .
it &apos;s a countermeasure . they &apos;re trying to manage perceptions
trying to prove they don &apos;t have anything to hide .
they know where kate is right now .
well we don &apos;t know that for sure .
all right um ...
why don &apos;t we head to the hotel ok ?
we could go and look at the ocean .
i can &apos;t believe you &apos;re thinking about a view right now .
i &apos;m not .
you just said .
because it calms you .
ok you guys haven &apos;t been outside for days .
you haven &apos;t eaten . you haven &apos;t slept .
you cannot keep going like this .
you go ahead .
we think kate was comfortable with these guys .
how ? their only other encounter was
at the jet ski rental .
the only documented encounter .
garcia &apos;s running her friends &apos; credit cards too .
they could have met someplace else .
i don &apos;t know . she &apos;s a smart girl .
well they &apos;re handsome charming 19 .
you remember 19 ?
she would know better than to be outnumbered .
what if pearson promised to dump jim barrett ?
and what jim retaliated ?
i could work that theory .
when do we get the results ?
any minute .
so what if they didn &apos;t do it ?
then we &apos;re back to nothing ?
one of them knows where kate is .
how can you be sure ?
because an innocent person doesn &apos;t sit quietly for 3 days .
they get angry and defensive .
these guys are going out of their way to appear calm and in control .
they &apos;ve got something to hide .
then why take the polygraph ?
&apos;cause they &apos;re stalling .
serial killers are kings of manipulation .
serial killers ? uh there &apos;s only one potential victim .
serial killing is a qualitative characteristic .
it not just about numbers .
they &apos;ve assaulted at least one girl before .
it was only a matter of time before they did it again .
barrett &apos;s a perfect match for pearson .
his family uprooted from the city
forcing him to adapt to his new surroundings .
he &apos;s eager to fit in and quick to follow .
and pearson &apos;s definitely got the dominant traits .
he &apos;s loud he &apos;s physical he &apos;s smart
he &apos;s charismatic and he &apos;s privileged .
sounds like a peach .
you should talk to him .
love to .
i &apos;ll take you to him .
jj how are the joyces doing ?
they lost their son 3 years ago .
if we can &apos;t find kate ...
if kate knew these boys better than we thought
you might want to dig a little .
dig ?
if the family thinks it could help they may reveal something .
i know . it &apos;s just ...
they shouldn &apos;t have to .
hotch we can &apos;t lose her .
strauss thinks we &apos;re all replaceable .
i went over her head to try to explain that we &apos;re not .
are you the bad cop ?
i &apos;m not a cop .
sydney xavier pearson .
a name like that didn &apos;t come with manners ?
a gentleman walks a lady to the door .
she wasn &apos;t much of a lady .
watch your mouth .
the girl was horny man .
i mean she practically begged me for it .
the son of a bitch passed . that &apos;s a bunch of bull--
how ?
how &apos;d you do it ?
bastard believes his lies are the truth .
takes a few deep breaths and passes .
old @-@ timer &apos;s kind of dramatic isn &apos;t he ?
you know it &apos;s actually much simpler than that .
you see uh
i didn &apos;t actually do anything to her .
you didn &apos;t do anything ? you gave me some pretty graphic details .
oh don &apos;t get me wrong .
my dna is ... all over that girl but uh
that doesn &apos;t mean i killed her .
i got pictures .
what ?
on my cell .
you want to see ?
you &apos;re giving us consent ?
give me this guy &apos;s property ! now !
what the hell was that ?
that was the camera .
no the yelling .
that was agent morgan .
barrett it says here you were half an hour late
to work on saturday morning .
i was hung @-@ over .
hung @-@ over ? that &apos;s nothing new
but being late is .
it looks like you always clock in 10 minutes early
gas up the jet skis get the life vests out .
what happened that morning ?
i just told you . i was hung @-@ over .
got you . hung @-@ over
slept in .
what about friday night
friday after the bar ?
we drove to the inlet .
drove to the inlet .
approximately what time would you say you drove to the inlet ?
2 : 00.2 : 30 .
why would you go to the water at 2 : 00 or 2 : 30 in the morning ?
the boats start coming in .
in the middle of the night the boats start coming in ?
yeah . they fish all night
then they bring in the catch .
then they sell it on the docks
to the restaurants and all that .
syd wanted to show her then he drove her back
dropped her off at the hotel
and the next thing i know it &apos;s morning .
and you slept in ?
my alarm clock &apos;s broken .
broken . your alarm clock &apos;s broken ?
broken .
did it make you upset ?
can you fix the damn camera please ? !
sit down .
how &apos;d you pass it ?
now a gentleman never shares
but ...
see ?
no tears .
now you see how happy she was ?
did kate drink often ?
i told you she &apos;s an athlete .
were you surprised she had a fake i.d. ?
it &apos;s no secret . she liked going out with her friends .
why are you doing this ?
i &apos;m not judging kate .
i want to find her .
what time is it ?
7 : 30 .
it &apos;s almost dark out .
we can &apos;t do this anymore . please just find her .
where is she ?
i don &apos;t know .
where is kate joyce ?
you got a hair or something ?
you know what i don &apos;t get it rossi
what i just can &apos;t wrap my brain around ?
no what &apos;s that ?
how this could have been consensual .
don &apos;t sit down . don &apos;t sit down .
consensual huh ?
what does that look like ?
how do you get a nice girl like kate
to do both of you in the same night ?
she liked it .
what did she like ?
what did she do both of you at once ?
come on you know that .
did you take turns ?
what ?
i mean you said she liked it .
but what ? what did she like ?
you know man .
no i don &apos;t .
is this what you did to her ? hmm ?
you pin her down ?
i told you she liked it .
you held her just like this .
you choked her .
well how long before she tapped out ?
this is exactly what you did to her .
you know what i think syd ?
i think kate didn &apos;t want to fool around with your friend .
so she begged you to take her home .
but you couldn &apos;t diss your boy like that could you ?
so you helped him .
pinned her down in the backseat .
maybe you threw her out in the dirt .
maybe you hit her too hard
she stopped breathing
you were stuck weren &apos;t you ?
it &apos;s not true .
is that what you mean by consensual ?
they sure know how to run out the clock .
yeah . what have we got ?
less than 3 hours .
what do you think ?
well he &apos;s not smart enough to have done this by himself .
he &apos;s always been a follower .
pearson &apos;s charming enough to pick up a good girl
but barrett was just along for the ride .
take a look at the photos .
oh she wasn &apos;t interested in barrett at all .
but he &apos;s the one she met in the morning .
all right . well i &apos;ll keep pushing .
how &apos;s it going in there ?
i wouldn &apos;t be surprised
if morgan turned off the camera in a minute .
i told you agent jareau &apos;s transfer
is an executive decision .
ma &apos;am i &apos;m asking you not to take it out on agent jareau
because i went over your head .
i know this is emotional for you--
it &apos;s not emotional .
it &apos;s a bad decision . she &apos;s a vital member of our team .
i &apos;m afraid it &apos;s a done deal .
that &apos;s unacceptable .
well what do you want me to do aaron
lose my job so she can keep hers ?
and i have no say in this ?
you don &apos;t get it .
they &apos;re not asking you .
they want her back in d.c. now .
what do you think ?
i don &apos;t know .
this kid &apos;s got no shame .
no guilt .
he did horrible things to kate but ...
i don &apos;t think he killed her .
so what are we saying ? the only thing he &apos;s guilty of
is being a scumbag ?
any official charge for that ?
the storm came through and separated the land .
that &apos;s what made the inlet .
huh .
one thing you can trust is the ground beneath you
until one day it all just shifts .
is that some kind of a metaphor ?
you tell me .
it sounds like you &apos;re just trying to make some fancy point .
that &apos;s all .
he &apos;s smarter than you thought .
he never says the word water .
he always talks about the inlet .
well he &apos;s a local kid . he knows the specifics about the island .
he &apos;s getting sloppy .
you think it &apos;s all an act ?
barrett &apos;s never said her name .
he &apos;s fidgety looks like he &apos;s a submissive
but he &apos;s not entirely weak .
he doesn &apos;t have the looks or confidence to pull this off
so he calls syd to seal the deal .
we saw the pictures . kate rejected barrett .
what pictures ?
how does barrett pass a polygraph ?
even if he didn &apos;t kill her ...
he &apos;d have to make sure she &apos;s never found .
he &apos;s got a boat .
the locals checked it .
no sign kate was ever on it .
wouldn &apos;t a boat have gps ?
that &apos;s kate &apos;s phone .
there in the backseat .
kate &apos;s mom has that right now .
you sure ?
yeah . they recovered that from her room .
so she made it back .
kate &apos;s cell phone was left in the car
and then later turned up in her room .
how ?
we figure most of the story &apos;s true .
that &apos;s why they never changed it .
they did drop kate off at the hotel .
pearson took barrett home just like they said .
but then because barrett was rejected
he circled back to punish kate .
well why would she let him in ?
because he had this .
no sign of a struggle in the room .
barrett lured her outside
maybe drugged her took her to his boat .
he was obsessed with the inlet .
he knew the traffic patterns there
when the fishermen were coming in
and tourist charters were going out .
the blood from the catch attracts hundreds of sharks .
it &apos;s a feeding frenzy out there that time of night .
we asked him if he killed her .
he didn &apos;t .
asked where her body is . he doesn &apos;t know .
technically those aren &apos;t lies .
how can you prove this ?
we &apos;ll get them to admit it .
this was after you dropped kate at the motel . agreed ?
yes .
victory picture .
so kate &apos;s gone but her phone is right there .
and ?
we found it in her room . you got any idea how it got there ?
why is the gps on your boat missing ?
it isn &apos;t .
he tossed it after he dumped kate .
who are you ?
this .
this was your ticket into her room .
who is she ?
you said the inlet &apos;s quiet between 4 : 00 and 5 a.m.
that &apos;s when you took kate out right ?
you didn &apos;t want the search party to find her
so you kept going . and going .
you had 6 hours before work .
how far did you get ?
about 75 miles out ?
a full tank on a single outboard motor
will get you 150 miles . at 25 miles per hour
your round trip took just over 6 hours .
which is why you were late for work .
oh you didn &apos;t kill her .
you just left her to die .
that &apos;s why you asked for a polygraph .
you knew you &apos;d pass it .
why did you take kate to the inlet ?
to look at the boats .
come on man you know what happens down there
in the middle of the night .
sharks happen syd .
and they clean up your mess don &apos;t they ?
that &apos;s why you dumped her body out there .
did you dump her ?
no .
no ! what ?
god ...
no i didn &apos;t do that man .
i didn &apos;t--i didn &apos;t-- i mean i didn &apos;t do that .
i think your time &apos;s up .
oh yeah ? well you took away their daughter
their dignity .
you don &apos;t get to win .
we &apos;re going to find her .
you still think she has a chance huh ?
right . thank you .
coast guard &apos;s 70 miles out .
no sign of her .
kate &apos;s an amazing swimmer .
if he didn &apos;t kill her when she hit the water
there &apos;s still a chance .
jj that &apos;s 3 days in the ocean .
i know .
i know .
help ! help ! someone help me !
help !
please help me !
agent hotchner .
they found her hugging a buoy .
she &apos;s alive .
oh she did it .
she held on .
they found her . she &apos;s alive .
you know the first thing she said ?
she &apos;s sorry .
they choked her .
they ...
and she &apos;s sorry .
you saved my life .
i knew it wouldn &apos;t be fair to leave her alone but ...
i didn &apos;t want to live .
it &apos;s my little girl .
and it &apos;s my job to keep her safe and ...
i wasn &apos;t there .
you made her who she is .
she hung on in the middle of the ocean
for days .
that &apos;s strength i &apos;ve never seen before .
i want kate to meet you .
i &apos;d like that .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to think that ...
that your son was watching out for her .
when do i leave ?
the end of the week .
what ?
they wanted you to start tomorrow .
no i--i can &apos;t . i need to train someone .
i &apos;m not replacing you .
no hotch you can &apos;t take this on yourself .
your hands are full .
we &apos;ll figure it out .
i &apos;m hoping i can get you back .
strauss wanted you to fill this out .
exit interview .
are you kidding me ?
she &apos;s big on procedure .
just be honest .
i was hoping i could do something about this .
and i &apos;m sorry i couldn &apos;t .
i know .
how am i supposed to tell them i &apos;m leaving
when i don &apos;t want to go ?
the brass is really really good at taking power away .
it makes them feel like they &apos;re in charge .
that sounds like a profile .
you &apos;re going to be much better off than any of us you know that ?
i &apos;ll miss you .
no .
wait a minute . i thought hotch was supposed to--
it &apos;s above his pay grade .
strauss &apos; too .
they can just take you away ?
so we do nothing ?
it &apos;s done .
it can &apos;t be that simple .
it is .
this job is hard enough .
what are they trying to do bury us ?
you &apos;re too good .
that &apos;s the problem .
it &apos;s true . you &apos;re on everybody &apos;s wish list .
our loss is somebody else &apos;s gain .
they can &apos;t just take you away .
you still here ?
i figured you &apos;d get to me eventually .
you &apos;re leaving ?
you could have told me . i would have done something .
i would have made it impossible for them to let you go .
i would have put something in your file .
it &apos;s not up to me .
or hotch .
don &apos;t they understand that we &apos;re a family ?
that that &apos;s why this works is because we &apos;re a family .
do they even care ?
i don &apos;t know .
i can &apos;t believe ...
ok no that &apos;s--
i &apos;m supposed to say that this is a great opportunity
which it is .
i don &apos;t know the way this place works without you .
you &apos;re like the glue around here
who &apos;s gonna make us feel safe .
there &apos;s plenty of big strong men around .
see that right there ?
your total ignorance of how awesome you are
is one of the 5.000 things i love about you .
i &apos;m still gonna be in the city ok ?
more than normal probably .
sure .
and we &apos;ll make a plan .
breakfast every tuesday .
and life gets in the way .
and what if i only see you on birthdays and holidays ?
i won &apos;t let that happen .
ok .
you better not because i know where to find you .
yeah .
ok .
we &apos;ll walk out together .
uh ... there &apos;s--there &apos;s one more thing
i need to do before i go .
ok .
i &apos;m thankful for my years spent with this family .
for everything we shared
every chance we had to grow .
i &apos;ll take the best of them with me
and lead by their example wherever i go .
a friend told me to be honest with you .
so here it goes .
this isn &apos;t what i want
but i &apos;ll take the high road .
maybe it &apos;s because i look at everything as a lesson .
or because i don &apos;t want to walk around angry .
or maybe it &apos;s because i finally understand .
there are things we don &apos;t want to happen
but have to accept .
things we don &apos;t want to know
but have to learn .
and people we can &apos;t live without
