welcome , everyone . i &apos;m dr. debra radcliffe .
and today i &apos;m going to help you clean out your junk drawer .
of course , i &apos;m talking about an emotional junk drawer
where we store all the pain , fear , anger that shapes us .
who would like to share why they &apos;re here ?
this one didn &apos;t have her glasses at the high @-@ school auction .
thought she was bidding on a home organizer .
and what a lucky mistake .
in colombia , we never get to do things like this .
the only time that i ever went to a seminar
was how to escape the trunk of a car
when your hands are tied behind your back .
all right , everybody . on your feet .
okay . you know , i @-@ i sort of thought
this was a &quot; sit here and listen &quot; kind of a thing .
yeah .
or as i call it , marriage .
where &apos;s my husbands at ?
it &apos;s good to laugh at what makes us most uncomfortable .
but the next three hours will require active participation .
let &apos;s clear a little space for ourselves .
you said this was a 45 @-@ minute talk .
so what ? i was wrong .
what , is there a place that you &apos;d rather be
than connecting with your family ?
you &apos;re really asking this question on football sunday ?
all these men here gave up their football today .
thank you , mitchell , for your sacrifice .
hey , you know what ? i &apos;m missing a farmer &apos;s market to be here ,
so ... yeah , i just made it gayer .
it &apos;s perfectly normal to resist opening your emotional junk drawer .
i address that in chapter one -- &quot; hey , get a handle on it . &quot;
why don &apos;t we start with a fun activity to loosen everyone up ?
i don &apos;t care how loose we get , i &apos;m not spilling my guts
to some table lamp pretending it &apos;s my mother .
and i won &apos;t ask you to , jay .
that kind of silliness gives therapy a bad name .
we are going to play a game called tiger , rock star , bunny .
i got this .
uh , marry the tiger , kill the bunny ?
分别选出嫁娶 食用与杀死的对象
that &apos;s not my game .
when i call out tiger ,
you will become a ferocious tiger .
when i call out rock star ,
you will be ... a major rocker .
and when i call out bunny , you will be --
halfway home . goodbye .
oh , yeah , go ahead ,
but don &apos;t forget that we don &apos;t have a prenup .
aa let &apos;s get started .
tiger !
feel ridiculous . i might need booze for this .
oh , me likey that idea .
we are not cut out for this .
you can &apos;t compare yourself to me .
i was in &quot; cats . &quot;
no one &apos;s comparing themselves to you , cam .
rock star .
looking good , phil .
i won an air @-@ guitar contest in high school .
bet that got you a lot of air girlfriends .
come on , jay . loosen up . it &apos;s fun .
what the hell is that , dad ?
playing an accordion .
supposed to be a rock star .
i think you should do , like , a guitar or something .
i only know how to play the accordion .
pick on mitchell . he &apos;s playing a flute .
at least i hope he is .
so , why did they need you out of the house ?
they said it was some sort of therapy ,
but part of me thinks it &apos;s an intervention for mom .
so , how &apos;s school ?
well , in my newtonian mechanics class ,
we &apos;re learning how to calculate
the velocity of free falling objects in a ...
school &apos;s hard .
so , anyways , um ...
i sort of did something and i need your advice ,
but i don &apos;t want a lot of judgment and criticism .
and you came to me ?
yeah , you &apos;ve always had such a strong sense
of what &apos;s right and wrong .
you always know what--
i have a high @-@ school boy toy .
what ? ! who ?
it &apos;s luke &apos;s dorky friend reuben .
i feel so ashamed .
oh , my god . you should be . isn &apos;t he , like , 8 ?
no , he &apos;s 16 and 3 / 4,
and he has to shave almost every two weeks .
how did you let this happen ? you go to caltech .
you &apos;re surrounded by age @-@ appropriate dorks .
i know , but i was home and still feeling sad
about sanjay breaking up with me ,
and it &apos;s overwhelming here .
there are so many brilliant people ,
and reuben idolizes me .
i guess i just kind of needed that ,
so i let him kiss me ...
and a little bit of this .
i &apos;m so weak . i can &apos;t imagine anything worse .
i hooked up with andy .
what ? !
engaged andy ?
i know . we were all alone at this house
that dad had set up to be sexy--
dad made it sexy for you ? !
no , no , for the buyer , but andy and i were alone ,
a @-@ and suddenly ... bam .
bam ?
&quot; bam &quot; as in sex
or &quot; bam &quot; as in what reuben shouted when he unhooked my bra ?
let &apos;s just leave it at &quot; bam . &quot;
look at us .
i don &apos;t even know what to feel right now .
shame , guilt , fear .
these are just some of the things
we shoved in the back of our junk drawers
when we were young .
this exercise comes from chapter three ,
&quot; scary dreams , expired creams . &quot;
oh , i have both of those .
this may seem unconventional ,
but it helps access painful memories ...
this is nice .
no , it &apos;s not . it &apos;s weird .
you &apos;re so tense today , my little baby .
what are you worried about ?
us looking like idiots .
what ? we &apos;re superstars here .
married the longest , three happy children ,
one with a bright future .
you &apos;re right .
we &apos;re gonna win this thing .
it &apos;s not a competition .
exactly . we have this in the bag .
mitchell and cam fall apart
if they &apos;ve got to pick a restaurant ,
and all gloria ever does is yell at my dad .
yeah , i &apos;d really hate to be your dad right now .
now , tell me everything that you &apos;re thinking .
i &apos;m thinking about all that other stuff we could &apos;ve bid on
at that auction instead of this nonsense .
lunch with larry king . a ride along in a cop car .
i heard they let you tase someone .
jay , this is important .
dr. debra said that this is good for us .
now close your eyes .
why should i close my eyes ?
because i don &apos;t like you looking up at my neck like that .
the other day , i took a selfie from down there
and i thought that i was face timing with my grandmother .
i wemember my mom went into the store
and left me all alone in the back of a twuck .
okay , do you have to do the baby talk ?
i couldn &apos;t pronounce my r &apos;s when i was younger
and the other children made fun of me , mitchell .
it was very twaumatic .
mom ? mommy ? where are you ?
all right , i &apos;m -- i &apos;m starting to lose feeling .
oh , am i squishing your legs ?
no , i meant in our relationship .
all right , we need a game plan here .
my dad and sister are here .
let &apos;s keep a low profile -- light and surfacy .
but aren &apos;t we wasting a great opportunity
to learn more about me ?
we are not gonna be the sideshow gay couple .
okay , nothing too personal .
for god &apos;s sake , no bedroom stuff .
we &apos;re representing a community .
and how are you two doing here ?
we &apos;re very good , very healthy .
very happy .
yes .
cam , would you like to switch positions ?
i &apos;m not allowed to talk about that .
how &apos;s it going here with you two ?
not good . he &apos;s not even trying .
sounds like you &apos;re stuck in that drawer .
sounds like you &apos;re stuck in that metaphor .
what &apos;s holding you back , jay ?
i don &apos;t like to be held like this .
why ? &apos; cause you feel vulnerable ?
i don &apos;t know .
it just ... reminds me of something .
go with that . you &apos;re safe here .
i don &apos;t want to be safe here .
i don &apos;t want to talk about this .
about what ? tell me .
it &apos;s like the time my mom held me like this
when my dog ran away and never came back .
she kept telling me they didn &apos;t know how it got out ,
but i knew .
i left the gate open . it was my fault .
i lost checkers .
i can &apos;t take this .
wait , what -- what just happened ?
i don &apos;t know . i think he &apos;s not used to feeling emotions .
maybe it was too much for him .
no , no , this is good .
some people &apos;s junk drawers are so full ,
it &apos;s a struggle to open them .
w @-@ was he holding his chest ?
se .
something seemed wong .
jay , are you okay ? it &apos;s gloria .
dad . dad , come on .
ay , it &apos;s locked .
d @-@ dad , open up .
hang on , i got a paperclip .
be careful . he &apos;s very raw .
go ! go ! go ! go ! go !
jay !
i &apos;m still sad .
you prefer to hide in the bathroom
than to deal with your emotions !
gloria , what &apos;s the big deal ?
the big deal is that we &apos;re raising a child together ,
and you have a chance
to make him different than those two .
hello .
us ?
i &apos;m sorry . what &apos;s wrong with us ?
i &apos;d take a bullet for you ,
but you two are kind of neurotic .
we &apos;re not neurotic .
do people say that we &apos;re neurotic ?
they don &apos;t say that , do they ?
yes . yes .
all the junk wants to come out of the drawer .
can you feel it ?
i can .
no , jay doesn &apos;t feel anything .
i feel lots of things .
annoyed that i &apos;m missing my game ,
joy that the steelers are winning .
oh , what is the score ?
we &apos;re not gonna talk about football here !
gloria &apos;s right .
we should talk about deeper things
like those awkward years between 14 to 6 .
oh . yes .
when do we get to talk about the dumb things
that our husbands do ?
gloria , thank you . i &apos;m glad you said that .
you &apos;re welcome . at least somebody &apos;s helping .
because that kind of language is counterproductive .
oh , snap .
this next exercise will teach us how to communicate our needs
in a constructive and non @-@ threatening manner .
we do that all the time .
very constructively communicated .
would one of my couples like to help me demonstrate
for the rest of the group ?
yes , we would . we &apos;d love to help .
how is this low profile ?
oh , come on , it &apos;ll fun .
your chair , please , cam .
sure .
face this way .
thank you .
now , i &apos;d like you both to think of a behavior
of your partner &apos;s that you would like to change .
but we &apos;re going to avoid phrases
like &quot; you always &quot; and &quot; you never , &quot;
and instead put it in terms of how we feel .
okay .
mitch , you &apos;ll start .
okay .
sometimes , i wish you wouldn &apos;t wear blue so much
because i feel jealous that you look so good in it .
now , cam , let mitch know if you heard him
and if you feel you can do that .
i did hear that .
okay .
and i will try to wear less blue .
very good . very good .
maybe dig a little deeper in the drawer .
well , sometimes when you don &apos;t use a coaster
with a -- a drink ,
i get anxious because i love our furniture
and we bought it together .
aww , that &apos;s very sweet . i hear that .
and i &apos;m gonna try and use a coaster more .
okay . excellent , both of you .
mitch , keep going .
yeah , so , uh ... sometimes when you leave the room
and you don &apos;t turn off the lights , i just feel --
seriously ? that again ?
surfacy .
well , i told you not to harp on me about the lights .
oh , because this is the first time
that i &apos;m hearing about the coasters .
here we go .
okay , i don &apos;t appreciate the smirking .
i hear you , mitchell ,
and i will try to smirk when you &apos;re not looking .
i feel like if andy weren &apos;t engaged , we &apos;d have a chance .
and if reuben were just a little bit older
and didn &apos;t wear prescription shoes --
it &apos;d still be gross .
i know .
what are we gonna do ?
we should both just end it .
i am not killing myself .
no ! break up with them .
oh , god .
you deserve somebody that isn &apos;t engaged to somebody else .
yeah , and you deserve to be with someone
who didn &apos;t take baths with luke .
i already tried to dump him once .
hopefully it &apos;ll go better this time .
look , i &apos;m sick of hiding our love .
if you &apos;re ashamed of me -- - i am .
then maybe we should break up .
we should .
no , please don &apos;t break up with me .
you &apos;re the -- the smartest ,
most beautiful girl on the planet .
fine .
i &apos;m gonna text andy right now ,
and tell him we need to talk today ,
and you should , too .
i can &apos;t text him .
he lost his phone privileges
until he gets his spanish grade back up ,
but i &apos;ll just go hang around the playground
till his kickball practice is over .
i &apos;m glad we talked .
me too .
this is how we &apos;re gonna stay on track
for the rest of our lives --
by always being there for each other .
he plays kickball ?
equipment manager .
now that we &apos;re learning to communicate constructively ,
let &apos;s put those new skills to use .
thank you .
i want everyone to write down
everything about your partner that drives you crazy .
really ?
the drawers are open . dig in .
sounds a little marriage @-@ endy , doesn &apos;t it ?
i mean , it does , but not for us .
maybe ...
interesting .
phil , there &apos;s nothing that bugs you about claire ?
nope .
not even &quot; me likey &quot; ?
what &apos;s he talking about ?
i have no idea .
he says you say it a lot and it drives him crazy .
phil .
okay , uh , claire . yeah .
i love you .
i know .
but when you use that expression ,
it makes me feel , um ... icky .
but , i mean , i &apos;ve hardly ever even used the expression --
&quot; me likey sushi , me likey &apos; game of thrones &apos; , &quot;
&quot; me likey chardonnay . &quot;
it does hit my ear wrong . but you know what ? forget it .
i &apos;m sorry . i got nothing to complain about .
me lucky .
phil , never apologize for your feelings .
i thought we &apos;re not supposed to say &quot; never . &quot;
good catch , jay . thank you .
as the kids say , it &apos;s going to get real up in here ,
but trust me , after that ,
once i &apos;ve guided you through the extremely specific steps
in deciding what goes back in the drawer
and what gets thrown out ,
you will be the best version of yourselves .
it always works .
don &apos;t say &quot; always . &quot;
thank you .
let &apos;s get writing .
nothing is off @-@ limits .
these are your private thoughts ,
and you are entitled to them .
excuse me .
you think i &apos;m too loud ?
how am i loud ?
well , you take in too much air
and you expel that air with large and sudden bursts .
that &apos;s how .
oh , so you &apos;re saying that i am full of hot air ?
no , i &apos;m saying just the opposite .
none of the air stays in you .
the lights again . now you &apos;ve written it down ?
i &apos;m trying to stick to the small stuff .
oh , well , congratulations .
you nailed it , because that &apos;s real small .
it -- okay , it bothers me , all right ?
i @-@ i &apos;ve asked you very nicely to turn off the lights .
constantly .
it &apos;s like we &apos;re londoners hiding from war planes .
why did you write down &quot; teepee joke &quot; ?
debra said these are my personal and private thoughts .
i love that joke . i tell it all the time . it &apos;s funny .
to you .
okay . listen up , guys .
this guy walks into his shrink &apos;s office and he says ,
&quot; doc , what &apos;s wrong with me ? &quot;
&quot; i &apos;m a teepee . i &apos;m a wigwam . &quot;
and the doc says ,
&quot; that &apos;s your problem . you &apos;re two tents . &quot;
do you get it ? two tents .
that &apos;s bad , claire . that &apos;s really bad .
you made her like that .
if you let her feel things ,
maybe she &apos;ll know what is funny .
don &apos;t care what you people think .
me likey .
what is wrong with &quot; me likey &quot; ?
claire ...
yes .
i love you .
oh , then stop saying it !
it just seems a little childish .
really ?
&apos;cause you &apos;re the one
who can &apos;t stop playing with his pogo stick .
you know what ? maybe you &apos;d be happier
if you played with my pogo stick once in a while .
oh , my god !
what &apos;s sad is they &apos;re actually talking about a pogo stick .
what &apos;s sad is you love electricity more than me .
it &apos;s like we have a deranged second grader
bouncing around the neighborhood .
when did you get so old ? !
i mean , i love you !
all right , cam ,
it &apos;s been a pet peeve of mine since i was a kid ,
and i &apos;ve asked you so many times that when you ignore me ,
it feels a little passive @-@ aggressive .
and when you nag me constantly ,
it feels like i &apos;m talking to my mother .
when i have to nag you ,
it makes me feel like i am your mother ,
which could be why it &apos;s been a month
since we played with each other &apos;s pogo sticks .
oh , my god !
how do you think we feel , mitchell ? !
miss , this is not going the way it should be .
why don &apos;t you tell us how to fix this ?
i &apos;m so sorry . i have to go .
no , no , no !
you have to help us put this back together !
it &apos;s a family emergency .
trust me , it cannot be as bad as this one .
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m sorry !
but i have to go pick up my son
because my idiot ex @-@ husband loaned his car
to his latest tinder whore .
we paid good money for this .
no , it was only $ 84 .
excuse me ?
i would &apos;ve paid more , but nobody else was bidding .
that &apos;s great .
you know what ? i deserve it .
this is what you get for dumbing down 30 years of research
for a trite analogy of a junk drawer .
just because my editor told me
it would get me on the &quot; ellen &quot; show .
you were on &quot; ellen &quot; ?
oh , yeah , yeah .
i danced my way into america &apos;s heart ,
and that &apos;s why i &apos;m stuck here on a sunday afternoon for 80 bucks .
wait . you can &apos;t leave now .
all our junk is out !
that &apos;s a cool shirt . you look nice .
i have to cut you off right there .
the shirt stays on .
i have to hang up on this booty call .
wait , what ?
you and me , this -- this has to stop .
i &apos;m so racked with guilt .
i keep giving money to different charities .
i even fronted a zach braff movie on kickstarter .
andy , slow down .
no , you &apos;re not gonna talk me into it .
i &apos;m even wearing embarrassing underwear just in case .
oh , god , you &apos;re making this so much easier .
look , i texted you to say the same thing .
you did ?
yeah .
i &apos;m trying to be a better person .
and , ironically , you &apos;re one of the reasons why , but ...
a better person does not hook up with an engaged person .
so , what now ?
i don &apos;t know .
we &apos;re still gonna see each other .
you work for , like , half my family .
do i remove you from my calling circle ?
i think that &apos;s between you and your wireless carrier .
i guess that &apos;s that .
it &apos;s not like it &apos;s goodbye forever .
it &apos;s just ...
when we run into each other from now on ,
we keep our clothes on .
yes . totally .
but , you know ...
if things were different --
i know .
bye , haley .
bye .
so , that &apos;s it ? it &apos;s over ?
i can &apos;t believe she just left like that .
great . now what ?
i know what you &apos;re all thinking ,
and , yes , i will take over as group leader .
no one &apos;s thinking that .
i &apos;m the only one with improv experience .
oh , really ?
or was i the only white member of ha ha blacksheep ?
i seem to remember bringing down the hizouse
with such classic characters as a scared tourist ,
quarterback , and bryant gumbel .
i &apos;ll tag you in if i need you . all right , everyone .
this first exercise is called entrances and exits .
let me go first .
i &apos;m leaving to watch the football game .
no , senor ! jay , no .
oh , dear god !
the only reason we stirred all this up
is &apos; cause mrs. magoo here
thought she was bidding on a home organizer .
i knew exactly what i was doing !
i have tried everything .
i just needed a new way to get you to express your feelings
and to allow other people to express theirs .
i need you to be fine
with manny dancing around the living room when he &apos;s happy
and joe crying when he &apos;s sad .
you don &apos;t see the downside to all this ?
no .
mitchell , you want to weigh in here ?
we &apos;re all reliving it .
how about you two ?
you feel good about getting all this stuff out in the open ?
let me just make one thing perfectly clear .
there were two tents .
t @-@ e @-@ n @-@ t @-@ s and t @-@ e-- you &apos;re right .
it &apos;s a horrible joke . but it &apos;s all your fault .
i told you !
for the record , we are just as grossed out
at the thought of you all having sex --
that &apos;s it ! i &apos;m out ! what the hell are we doing ?
dancing around , telling secrets like girls at a slumber party .
i can just imagine my old man with his buddies
sitting at their lawn chairs , laughing their asses off
that i missed a whole day of football
&apos;cause i &apos;m trying to get in touch with my emotions .
these guys didn &apos;t do that crap . these were men !
his best friend tommy ryan
lost half a finger in a sheet metal press .
waited until his shift ended to go to the hospital .
i broke my collar bone in a football game .
there was dad up in the stands giving me the old &quot; be tough . &quot;
so i played two more downs before i passed out .
my date , maryjo klumsky ,
left the senior dance with another guy .
broke my heart .
2 : 00 a.m. at the kitchen table , my old man &apos;s telling me ,
&quot; eat the sandwich and forget about her . &quot;
feelings !
i didn &apos;t even cry at his funeral . you believe that ?
the guy was my whole world .
not a tear .
everybody looking at me like -- like i didn &apos;t love him .
but he knew .
he had to know , right ?
of course he did .
son of a bitch , that felt good getting that out .
i know .
they just won therapy .
hey , it &apos;s me . i broke up with reuben .
i knew he &apos;d be crushed ,
so i did it quickly like ripping off
one of his incredible hulk band @-@ aids .
so , how about you ? did you do it ?
yep . i sure did .
&quot; why do we choose partners so different from ourselves ?
it &apos;s not fate or chance
or cliches like &apos; the heart wants what the heart wants &apos; . &quot;
&quot; we choose our partners because they represent
the unfinished business from our childhood . &quot;
phil .
phil .
&quot; and we choose them
because they manifest the qualities we wish we had . &quot;
i &apos;m afraid i &apos;m not fun enough for you .
yeah .
my sayings aren &apos;t cute , my jokes aren &apos;t funny , and --
and you &apos;re gonna get sick of me once the kids leave
and you realize how truly crazy i am .
really ?
honey , i already know how crazy you are .
&quot; in doing so , in choosing such a challenging partner ,
and working to give them what they need ,
we chart a course for our own growth . &quot;
go to sleep , jay @-@ jay .
i &apos;m telling you , the woman is a genius .
i didn &apos;t feel like going to my grandpa &apos;s house that sunday ,
so i pretended to have a cold .
wouldn &apos;t you know it , a few days later ...
oh , no .
yep . i got the cold .
i thought it was karma , so i hopped on my bike
and i rode straight to my grandpa &apos;s .
i climbed in his lap and i hugged him so hard .
we even shared an ice cream cone .
it &apos;s a memory i &apos;ll always cherish ,
&apos;cause in a crazy coincidence ,
he got a cold too and was dead within a week .
