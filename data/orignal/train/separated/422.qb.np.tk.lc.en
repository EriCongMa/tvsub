i understand , hotch .
take all the time you need .
yeah , yeah , yeah , we &apos;ll be fine .
ok . you , too .
i was hoping i could get a minute .
agent seaver has requested her remedial training be here .
she was only cleared for one case .
that didn &apos;t end the way she had hoped .
i &apos;d say .
she made a mistake .
but she remained calm under pressure .
she just wants to prove herself .
hotch isn &apos;t here to supervise her .
i &apos;ll do it . i &apos;ll be her training agent .
he signed off ?
via email .
but i know you have a history with her .
don &apos;t make me regret this .
thank you .
ma &apos;am .
agent .
have you heard from aaron ?
he sounds like he hadn &apos;t slept .
do you think he &apos;s all right ?
jack &apos;s having some problems .
well , it &apos;s been a year since ...
well , i &apos;m glad he &apos;s finally taking some time off .
this is the only thing that &apos;s pending .
donald sanderson ?
that was 20 years ago .
25 , actually . he &apos;s up for parole .
they &apos;ve asked us to do a risk assessment .
well , i can &apos;t do it , not with aaron gone .
well , who can ?
morgan , can you come in here ?
well , he &apos;s got to meet him today .
the parole board hearing is tomorrow .
now , what was his story ?
junkies randomly attacked his family ?
yes , that &apos;s what he claimed .
he and his son survived .
frankly , i don &apos;t understand
how parole is even a consideration .
well , he &apos;s eligible . they &apos;re overcrowded .
yes , but the physical evidence was shocking .
who could possibly believe he would be innocent ?
that &apos;s not our job .
all we need to see is
how 25 years has changed his life .
ma &apos;am .
is everything all right ?
i need you to take a trip .
who &apos;s this ?
don sanderson .
he &apos;s been in petersburg half his life
and he &apos;s up for parole .
it appears he &apos;s become a model prisoner .
you don &apos;t sound convinced .
i don &apos;t know how someone who kills his wife and daughter
can be rehabilitated .
open 7 .
on the gate .
ssa derek morgan .
bau .
you analyze behavior .
close it .
nobody &apos;s ever believed that i &apos;m innocent .
why would you ?
may i ?
yeah .
i don &apos;t rely solely on physical evidence .
it says here that you were 2 years into your residency when all this happened .
what did you want to specialize in ?
pediatrics .
you haven &apos;t requested parole
in over 18 years .
the system put me in here .
they &apos;re gonna keep me in here .
time &apos;s gone by a little faster since i accepted that .
has the heroin helped you pass the time ?
they found it in your cell 2 years ago .
new regime had to assert power .
you &apos;re saying someone planted it .
it is what it is .
you hadn &apos;t been in solitary since you got here .
gave me a lot of time to think about my son .
your son &apos;s name is joshua ?
i &apos;m sorry , i still don &apos;t understand how you &apos;re ...
can ignore all that evidence .
the prosecution said that i had an acute psychological break ,
that i was a psychopath .
is that what you see ?
psychopaths are masters at hiding what &apos;s inside of them .
is that what you think i &apos;ve done ?
agent , do you have any idea what it &apos;s like
to be accused of something that you didn &apos;t do ?
you went to the infirmary 16 times ,
and not once did you ever try to fight back .
no .
the last time they beat me , they ...
well ...
i--i almost had it .
i mean , i didn &apos;t think that i was gonna make it .
and i was ok with that .
but i was lying there ...
and i had this , uh ...
vision .
see , joshua was , uh , was grown up .
the sun was shining on us .
i--i don &apos;t know where we were .
but i got to tell him
that i didn &apos;t hurt our family .
and that &apos;s what &apos;s kept you going ?
and then i just didn &apos;t want to feel sorry for myself .
i wanted--i wanted to-- to live my life in here
the way that i would have lived it out there
and do things that i got cheated out of with joshua .
is that why you &apos;ve taught men how to read ?
why you started a mentor program ?
you &apos;ve helped ...
41 inmates get their g.e.d.
mr. sanderson , this is the type of evidence i consider .
if you were to gain your freedom ...
what would you do with it ?
i can &apos;t even think about something like that .
but what would you do ?
i would try and find my son ...
and i &apos;d tell him the truth .
based on physical evidence ,
don sanderson has been prosecuted to the full extent of the law .
but ... the way in which he has spent the last 25 years ...
it throws doubt on that conviction .
now , i know that is not the question at hand here today .
i have learned that behavior does not lie .
you all want to know whether or not this man has been reformed .
i believe that he has .
he &apos;s lost everything ,
yet somehow he has still managed to better himself .
more importantly to people around him ,
he &apos;s held on to the only good thing left in his life .
his son .
it &apos;s what defines him .
at this point ,
he &apos;s simply looking ahead .
therefore ,
it is my belief that don sanderson
is not a danger to himself or to society .
goodbye , now .
i , uh , noticed you all drink double shots .
oh , thanks . you do , too ?
this is the first .
i wanted to thank you for having my back .
i hope you have mine .
front page news , eh ?
morgan must not think he did it .
or believes he won &apos;t do it again .
is agent morgan in ?
what do you need , erin ?
metro p.d. sent this an hour ago .
and they want us to take a look ?
no , they want you to take a look .
who &apos;s this ?
the man don sanderson just murdered .
&quot; there is no such thing as part freedom . &quot;
nelson mandela .
why didn &apos;t sanderson just run ?
maybe he wanted to go back to prison .
there are plenty of ways to violate your parole other than homicide .
is morgan ok ?
he just vouched for a man
that turned around and killed someone .
so he &apos;s the one let him out ?
come on , bill , you know it &apos;s never that simple .
oh , you see this all the time , rossi .
guy &apos;s out for a couple of days , he &apos;s gotta get back inside .
then why did he claim self @-@ defense ?
why call the paramedics ?
why attempt cpr to keep him breathing ?
why not just flee the scene ?
he wanted something else .
like what ?
i don &apos;t know yet .
well , he &apos;s predictable , if you ask me .
he broke into this guy &apos;s basement and stabbed him ,
same way he did his wife .
rossi .
he &apos;s coming with us .
get out of the car .
let &apos;s go , move .
you &apos;re welcome to join us .
after i clean up here .
this is not a random act of violence .
there has to be a reason .
anything could have been a weapon .
so he chose to stab him ,
just like he did before .
hello , tommy .
so he dialed 911,
then he performed cpr .
why go through this big fight
and then try and save him .
so the gun wasn &apos;t loaded , but he broke in , took it ,
and waited for wittman to get home ? why ?
i don &apos;t know , love ,
but i do know that your victim
legally purchased that .38
in &apos; 94 , licensed to him .
other than that , no weapons , wives , or children .
the guy was pretty much a loner .
so there &apos;s gotta be some sort of connection .
there isn &apos;t any yet . i &apos;m sorry .
all right . thank you , garcia .
yeah , hey , how is my boy ?
uh , fine .
really ?
no .
the bullets were in the other room ,
but the gun is right here .
maybe killing him was an accident ?
does any of this strike you as hard to believe ?
neighbors confirmed hearing sounds of a confrontation .
yeah , but sanderson was out of prison for what , reid ?
at the time of the murder , 51 hours .
he &apos;s free for 2 days and change ?
what &apos;s the big hurry to find this guy ?
you woke up a free man
and decided to kill tom wittman .
you gotta help us out here . it doesn &apos;t look good for you .
it wasn &apos;t supposed to be like that .
he came at me .
i get it that you don &apos;t trust anyone right now .
but this man is the reason that you &apos;re free .
did you find your son ?
no .
did you even look ?
drive .
how is he ?
clearing his head .
strauss is waiting for you guys to come back .
great . that &apos;s all he needs .
we still don &apos;t know how tom wittman is connected
to don sanderson .
all we know about him is everything morgan went over ,
what he was accused of .
and that he killed tom whitman this morning .
the guy &apos;s not talking .
he doesn &apos;t trust anybody .
if he doesn &apos;t tell us who tom wittman is ,
how are we going to help derek ?
the answer &apos;s in there somewhere .
we just have to find it .
all right , march 10 , 1985,
2 : 30 a.m.
don sanderson was asleep on his couch
because of an argument he had with his wife .
he woke up to her screams .
he ran to the bedroom to find one man stabbing her .
another man struck him from behind , knocking him unconscious .
his wounds were superficial in comparison ,
so it was easy for the prosecution to claim
that sanderson &apos;s wounds were self @-@ inflicted .
and he had just finished his second year of residency
at georgetown , indicating he had the skills to do it to himself .
and his fingerprints were all over the weapon .
so , sanderson comes to , his wife and daughter are dead .
almost dead . he called for help .
sounds familiar .
he said that two men killed his wife ,
but when officers arrived ,
he changed his story . he added a woman .
let me guess . they never found her .
no one ever looked .
so we have 3 people who commit a brutal
double homicide , then never act on it again ?
i don &apos;t know , it seems unlikely .
but nothing like that ever happened after sanderson went to prison .
the question is , how does tom wittman play into this ?
he was a teenager at the time .
strauss .
i want everything from tom wittman &apos;s apartment .
it &apos;s on its way .
do you think wittman was there that night ?
that depends .
on what ?
if you believe sanderson &apos;s story .
my office will handle the press from here on .
that &apos;s unnecessary .
you don &apos;t need any more distractions .
he looks genuinely distraught .
he &apos;s very convincing .
i can see why you fell for it .
i don &apos;t need to remind you
that your reputation &apos;s on the line here .
that &apos;s not what matters to me right now .
it should .
you played me .
i know how this looks .
oh , do you ?
oh , well , please , enlighten me .
how does this look ?
i didn &apos;t do it .
yes , you did !
and now that &apos;s on me .
i bought into your holier @-@ than @-@ thou garbage !
i put a psychotic killer back out on the street ,
and in less than 51 hours you went right back to your old ways .
i didn &apos;t want to .
then why did you ?
because he would have killed me .
no . no .
it &apos;s more than that .
it better be more than that .
why did you go to his house ?
why would you risk your freedom to go after this man ?
this is the rest of tom wittman &apos;s house .
hey , guys . derek said that the sandersons got into an argument
on the night of the murders .
so , i went ahead and did a background check .
there is no history of abuse , domestic calls ,
therapy from the outside in - they were like the perfect family .
nobody &apos;s perfect .
yeah , but married right out of college ,
medical school , 2 kids ,
house on a hill , dog .
pretty damn close . yeah ?
ok , so one night they argue .
he takes the couch ,
leaving the wife and kids upstairs vulnerable .
he claims the offenders broke in through the basement .
there were security bars on the window ,
but they were old and broken .
that was such an obscure fact , though .
it was deemed only someone
with an intimate knowledge of the house
would suggest that as an entry point .
yeah , but that means that 3 people
walked past sanderson while he was sleeping on the couch .
why didn &apos;t he wake up ?
and why would they walk right past him without subduing him ?
it looks like their goal was upstairs .
she had a stuffed animal .
who does that to a 5 @-@ year @-@ old ?
you know , the child was an afterthought .
the overkill was on mrs. sanderson .
that &apos;s an understatement .
he was sending a message .
like what ?
he &apos;s in control . he has all the power .
and he hates her .
you must be exhausted .
doing good time just so you can get out and kill again .
i &apos;m not a murderer .
you are a murderer .
you just stabbed a man to death .
i didn &apos;t have a choice .
he saw me , he panicked , he would have killed me .
i &apos;m telling you , i didn &apos;t have a choice .
he didn &apos;t kill my family .
he was going to lead me to the one who did .
all right .
and if you had gotten to this person
that allegedly killed your family ,
what were you gonna do then .
the same thing you just did to tom wittman ?
no , i &apos;m not a killer .
ok , yes .
yes . there wasn &apos;t a day that i was locked up
where i didn &apos;t hope that whoever took my family &apos;s lives was dead .
i wanted to find him and i wanted to destroy his life
like he did mine .
i wanted him to pay !
why wasn &apos;t tom wittman &apos;s name mentioned at your trial ?
i didn &apos;t even know it until years later .
agent , what i saw
and what happened , that couldn &apos;t have been random .
so what did you do ?
just look at every single person that knew your family ?
yeah .
how ? how did you do that ?
you never once asked for access to your case .
all of it was my memory .
i walked through that night a million times .
tommy was just a kid then , 18 , 19 .
he worked at the corner market
and brought our groceries home .
he and his friend , they would look for any reason
to be near my wife .
i didn &apos;t like that .
carrie told him so and he stopped coming by .
so tom felt abandoned by your wife
and angry at you , so he acted out .
yeah , you see , except ...
that night he said-- he said , &quot; that &apos;s enough . &quot;
see , it &apos;s like he had actual boundaries .
that &apos;s how you narrowed this down ,
to somebody who cared about your wife ?
yeah .
tom--tom , he was just-- he was just--
he was a figure in the dark .
and then i heard his voice .
good morning , mr. sanderson .
and that was familiar .
it took me a long time to place it .
anyway ,
a few years later , i called the market
and tried to find his full name .
thomas gregory wittman .
i had internet privileges once a week ,
and i found his address .
and then what ?
a few days later , that heroin was planted in my cell .
i lost my privileges .
so tom wittman was the only link that you had
to figuring out who was in your house that night ?
and now i &apos;m back to nothing .
not necessarily .
you want to take him back to his house ?
if he can &apos;t figure out who else was there that night ,
there &apos;s no way to prove his story .
all right .
let &apos;s clean him up first .
this used to be a great place to live .
you ready ?
yeah .
no one stays here long , do they ?
you were asleep on the couch ?
in front of the fire .
so it was cold .
yeah .
and pouring down rain .
the tv was on .
what were you watching ?
reruns .
i &apos;d been on rotation for 36 hours .
between that and the rain ,
it took me about just a minute to fall asleep .
what wakes you ?
daddy !
daddy , help me , daddy !
help ! please !
help !
don !
daddy ! daddy , help me !
shut up !
he &apos;s hurting them .
who is ? tom ?
no , the one in the hood .
tom &apos;s saying ...
that &apos;s enough !
my little girl ...
she shouldn &apos;t be seeing this .
turn away , baby . turn away .
i can &apos;t get to her .
shut up !
help me !
no !
no , no , no , no ! you stay away from her !
there &apos;s a woman . there she is .
what does she look like ?
it &apos;s blurry .
here you go .
she gave abby her hippo .
my son .
she had my son .
what is she saying ?
stop it !
that &apos;s enough !
but he won &apos;t . he keeps holding me down .
he &apos;s laughing .
i want to keep him . he &apos;s just a baby .
put it back .
no . no !
they &apos;re fighting .
put it back .
she wants to take my son .
i said put it back !
they could have taken my son .
but she didn &apos;t take your son . he &apos;s safe .
they must have trusted one another .
we need to figure out who tom wittman &apos;s friends were back then .
the woman is the key .
she wanted to take the baby .
yeah . to build their own twisted family .
all right , keep me posted .
ok .
ok , the crazy thing about this
is that nobody turned on one another .
so they have to have a bond .
maybe they &apos;re related .
tom wittman didn &apos;t have any siblings .
it could be childhood friends .
uh , the only marks on his record are from juvie .
he cleaned up after that .
what were his arrests ?
petty stuff .
uh , anything related to breaking and entering ?
credit card schemes , retail robbery .
ok , now , wait .
that was big in the eighties .
one person would work in the store
and the other would use stolen credit cards .
sounds like a team .
yeah . was he arrested with anybody ?
i found tom wittman &apos;s juvie records .
other than him , no one was underage
involved in any of his arrests .
maybe they weren &apos;t the same age .
the woman wanted to keep a kid .
that doesn &apos;t sound like a teenager .
ok , i &apos;m gonna cross @-@ ref the date of wittman &apos;s arrest
with others made on that same day .
retail crimes . shoplifting was very big .
what about a woman who was arrested
from the same department store as tom ?
mary rutka , 22 at the time .
is she from d.c. ?
born and raised .
did she have any children ?
one 19 @-@ year @-@ old son .
morgan , are you back yet ? we may have found the woman .
that &apos;s her .
go .
he &apos;s going down the fire escape !
i need an ambulance and backup
at 751 hindry street , northeast , apartment 402 .
it &apos;s ok . it &apos;s ok . hold on .
hey ! fbi !
it looks like she fought him .
so some guy breaks in here , kills her ,
then runs away .
it &apos;s pretty risky .
he &apos;s hiding something and she was a witness to it .
he &apos;s cleaning up loose ends .
well , it looks like he made a mess to me .
how &apos;d you track her down .
she was arrested with tom wittman a long time ago .
sanderson gets out ,
wittman &apos;s killed , and now mary rutka .
the whole thing &apos;s a house of cards .
he got away with it for 20 years .
he &apos;s not about to get caught now .
any leads ?
nothing more than we saw .
well , he knows you &apos;re onto him .
what do you think he &apos;s gonna do now ?
well , i don &apos;t think he &apos;d trash the place for the hell of it .
i think he was looking for something and we interrupted him .
it makes sense why she survived until now .
what are you guys talking about ?
3 people got away with murder .
how do you make sure no one rats the other out ?
blackmail .
it sounds like we need to profile a dormant killer .
a very lucky one .
he was essentially given a gift--
a patsy in the form of don sanderson ,
and he &apos;ll do anything to protect that story .
when someone has a secret this big , everything becomes a lie .
he &apos;ll most likely be pathological .
so , we &apos;re looking for a liar in d.c.
i thought we were trying to narrow this down .
her son &apos;s 19 years old .
he doesn &apos;t have a bedroom , but she kept all his books .
she &apos;s sentimental .
hey , morgan .
almost there .
ah , sorry .
daddy help you make them ?
yeah ?
yeah .
did josh help you make them ?
yeah , he got the blueberries .
he got the blue-- well , thank you very much .
i love you .
i love you , too .
welcome to the sanderson home .
don &apos;t forget the view .
they look down on everybody .
he sounds jealous .
let &apos;s do this .
shh . you &apos;ll wake them .
garcia , can you isolate these images ?
yeah . which one ?
the one in the hood .
you think it &apos;s him ?
that could be a thousand guys .
i want to see them .
no . i don &apos;t think that &apos;s a good idea .
i wasn &apos;t allowed to have pictures .
for 25 years .
they thought that looking at them would get me off .
i don &apos;t want to forget my family .
see , they &apos;re--
they &apos;re here , and they &apos;re in flashes .
but i can feel them slipping away .
please .
daddy help you make them ?
yeah ?
yeah .
did josh help you make them ?
yeah , he got the blueberries .
he got the blue-- well , thank you very much .
and the butter .
and the butter . were you i charge of the eggs ?
i know you like to break the eggs , right ?
i love you .
i love you , too .
mommy ...
go ahead . go ahead .
ohh ! pancakes .
you guys are too good to me .
what we just watched was ...
debilitating . frenzied .
and documented , but not for a trophy .
it seems to be from wittman &apos;s point of view .
i mean , she &apos;s obviously an accessory .
why not just destroy the evidence ?
because she got something out of it .
her place was way more than she could afford .
she never got married .
and she had a son who went to private school .
do you think it &apos;s his kid ?
that would explain the bond
and why he didn &apos;t get rid of her before today .
you said her place was nice .
if he &apos;s covering his tracks , he &apos;s paying her in cash .
who can afford to do that ?
you want me to find rich and powerful men in d.c. ?
explain to me how to narrow down this list .
start with men who grew up in the district ,
came from nothing .
his ambition will define him .
whoever did this enjoys taking power away .
he &apos;s been way too smart to keep on killing .
so what would satisfy a guy like this ?
well , he &apos;s manipulative but trustworthy .
two other people witnessed
that murder and they never turned on him .
guys , so we have to think of this city
as the unsub &apos;s comfort zone . he didn &apos;t leave for a reason .
a target @-@ rich environment .
the damage he &apos;s done and continues to do
is right here in d.c.
politics ?
i think it &apos;s more intimate than that .
he needs victims who suffer directly from what he &apos;s doing .
ok , i &apos;ll cross the politicians off my list .
look into asset @-@ based lenders ,
uh , big money @-@ making ventures
where people would be left in his wake .
corporate takeovers .
businessman as psychopath ?
they have the same characteristics .
they just use their skills differently .
they both have narcissistic traits ,
such as a grandiose sense of self @-@ importance ,
deceptiveness , lack of remorse .
hard @-@ core businessmen , 36 and counting .
that &apos;s way too many .
we can each take 6 and look for connections .
no , no . wait a minute .
if we had this case 25 years ago ,
what would we have seen ?
how would we fight the physical evidence ?
we &apos;d look at what the unsub did
the moment he arrived at the house .
they broke into the basement .
through a window with rusted @-@ out bars .
garcia , who lived at the house before the sandersons ?
property records ...
well , it hasn &apos;t exchanged too many hands .
the barretts , the kramers , the stanworths .
any of those names on your list of businessmen ?
uh , no . let me look at that longer list .
hold , please . hey , family of james stanworth .
they lost the house in &apos; 82
and then they moved to the outskirts .
he sounded jealous on the tape . that makes sense .
he knew the sandersons
and he would obviously know that house .
there was nothing random about that attack .
a native washingtonian , married with 3 kids .
everything to lose .
what ?
he &apos;s running for congress .
check out his campaign slogan .
&quot; let &apos;s do this . &quot;
he said that on the tape .
this won &apos;t be easy .
you want to arrest james stanworth ?
are you out of your mind ?
he &apos;s got motive .
mary rutka had a tape . she was blackmailing him .
it was a hooded figure .
you can &apos;t prove it was him on that videotape .
he fits the profile , erin .
forgive me , but your profile sounds like a self @-@ made man ,
not the psychopath you claim he is .
we said he &apos;d be destructive .
in 1998 alone , he fired 6,000 people
from one of his companies .
some of those employees took their own lives .
this is the type of power and devastation that he enjoys .
hearsay . slander if you &apos;re not careful .
ma &apos;am , he got into politics to be hard on crime .
he would have access to keep tabs on don sanderson .
and now you &apos;re sounding as paranoid as don sanderson .
you cannot accuse a man
without a shred of physical evidence .
mary rutka had skin under her nails .
maybe she left a mark .
and you cannot arrest a man
based on the possibility of a scratch .
we can &apos;t arrest this man .
that &apos;s what you mean .
don &apos;t pull any punches now , erin .
you don &apos;t understand what the politics are , do you , dave ?
you never have .
no , i do .
i just don &apos;t care .
ma &apos;am , with all due respect ,
we have an innocent man in our custody ,
and the killer is still out there .
it just might be james stanworth .
you don &apos;t have enough proof .
the bau functions without you .
don &apos;t push it .
so there &apos;s nothing we can do ?
this guy &apos;s gonna get away with it ?
no . no , not a chance in hell .
garcia , find me james stanworth right now .
yeah .
another hour passes ,
he &apos;s that much closer to hiding his true self .
mary rutka &apos;s his third victim .
he &apos;s now officially a serial killer .
what do you want to do ?
i want to expose this son of a bitch .
if he did kill mary rutka ,
he &apos;s gonna have cuts on him somewhere .
we match that dna , we got him .
guys , he &apos;s having a fund @-@ raiser at his house in mcan .
when ?
it started an hour ago .
text me the address .
yep .
what if we &apos;re wrong ?
prentiss .
... which is why i insisted they come to d.c. ,
meet the policymakers ,
see that it &apos;s not as simple as signing our names ,
that the problems we &apos;re dealing with are not easy ones ,
that we have to plan not 2 steps ahead ,
but 200 steps .
that it &apos;s not just about what &apos;s in our families &apos; best interests ,
it &apos;s what &apos;s in our nation &apos;s . thank you .
ladies and gentlemen ,
congressman , mr. james stanworth .
you sure have a way with words . it &apos;s mighty impressive .
thank you .
may i help you ?
my name &apos;s derek morgan .
i &apos;m with the fbi .
do your friends here know that you &apos;re a closet psychopath ?
excuse me ?
don sanderson knows .
do you remember him ?
i &apos;m sure you do .
you murdered his entire family
and got him put away for 25 years .
well , agent , if you &apos;ve got anything on me ...
no .
james , it &apos;s not on you ,
it &apos;s inside of you .
killing mary rutka really got you going , didn &apos;t it ?
i &apos;m afraid i don &apos;t know who that is .
jim , what &apos;s going on ?
they were just leaving .
but i don &apos;t understand--
don &apos;t worry .
he &apos;s good at that , isn &apos;t he ? anger .
he &apos;s dismissive by nature . can &apos;t show affection , though , can he ?
you walk on eggshells , you and the children .
jim--
shut up !
here it comes .
where was your husband today around 3 : 00 ?
these are ridiculous fabrications .
it doesn &apos;t matter . we know where he was .
i held the hand of the woman he murdered .
right .
james , whoever did kill mary
left some dna behind ,
under her fingernails .
what &apos;s that ?
well , that would be a cut .
i cut myself on a broken glass .
no . mary rutka did that to you trying to defend herself .
you knew that don sanderson was out after 25 years .
he got to tom wittman ,
and you were afraid that if he got to mary ,
he might find you and bring you down
for what you did to his family all those years ago .
you &apos;re delusional , agent .
you panicked and you killed mary .
i don &apos;t panic .
you did panic .
you &apos;re a killer . it &apos;s what you do .
you destroy people &apos;s lives .
i destroyed no one .
you put a man away for life , you murdered his family ,
and today you killed a woman
who would never betray you ,
i killed no one .
because you panicked . you are a killer .
you are a psychopath . you panicked and--
i don &apos;t panic ! i don &apos;t panic !
there he is .
jim , what &apos;s going on .
call charles .
don &apos;t say another word .
they &apos;ve got nothing .
we found the tape .
james stanworth , you &apos;re under arrest
for the murder of mary rutka .
this is absurd .
you have the right to remain silent .
anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law .
you have the right to speak to an attorney .
if you cannot afford an attorney ...
there hasn &apos;t been a second when i haven &apos;t thought about this .
now it &apos;s here .
how does it feel ?
i &apos;m terrified .
you know , your son has been studying medicine .
he wants to open his own clinic .
it seems to me he &apos;s becoming a lot like his father .
i don &apos;t even know what he looks like .
well , it looks like you &apos;re about to find out .
yes , but i ...
what am i supposed to say to him ?
he knows that you didn &apos;t do it .
that &apos;s all you ever wanted him to know .
yeah .
go .
show him who is dad really is .
oh , my god .
joshua .
&quot; all truths are easy to understand once they are discovered .
the point is to discover them . &quot;
