gossip girl here--
your one and only source
into the scandalous lives of manhattan &apos;s elite .
i made the biggest mistake of my life walking out on you .
i promise to make it up to you ,
because i love you .
you told me you were selling me oxy ,
but those pills were antibiotics .
dad . look , i can explain .
get your things and come with me .
we &apos;re going home , to brooklyn .
if dr. van der woodsen loves your mother
as much as he said he did ,
then maybe there &apos;s something
she should know about rufus .
i want to talk to you about lily .
obviously , i &apos;m not a doctor ,
but there &apos;s something weird about her medicine .
name &apos;s cameron .
blair .
do you want to make that guy who showed up jealous or what ?
i &apos;m game if you are .
i &apos;m game .
new day , new designer .
whether it &apos;s love or war you &apos;re outfitting for ,
thank god for friends and fashion .
that one looks good .
chuck and i played &quot; wuthering heights &quot; in it .
i mean , who starts a courtship during the day anyway ?
humans who venture out in light and aren &apos;t named &quot; bass . &quot;
serena , i have to tell you something .
what &apos;s wrong ?
i &apos;ve never been on a date .
what about chuck ? and nate ?
and chuck . and then nate again .
no , i mean on a real date ,
with someone i didn &apos;t know already
or who was a british lord masquerading as a college student .
b. , obviously , cameron liked you
when he met you at the loft party .
just be yourself and have fun .
and try the marc jacobs .
i have to go .
what &apos;s going on ?
you haven &apos;t lusted after a louboutin all morning .
i just have to get home .
is it lily ?
i think rufus cheated on her .
oh , my god . i &apos;m so sorry .
i didn &apos;t know they even had groupies that old .
they met at the rooftop garden committee .
well , how is your mom taking it ?
she doesn &apos;t know . i told my dad ,
and he thought it would be best if we waited to tell her .
stress isn &apos;t good for her condition .
well , is there anything i can do ?
dorota &apos;s family has polish mob connections .
no . thank you , though .
i &apos;m just hoping rufus will stay away until she gets stronger .
and , b. , i don &apos;t know
if handcuffs are a good idea for a first date .
it &apos;s a good thing you &apos;re not a drug dealer anymore .
that girl you sold lily &apos;s fake oxy to
wanted double what she paid just to give me the bottle back .
so what &apos;d you find out ?
my personal pharmacist is looking into it .
do you trust him to know if they &apos;re bad for lily ?
he appreciates a fine pharmaceutical .
and why are you whispering ?
if it &apos;s a seduction technique , don &apos;t bother .
ew . you wish .
no , i @-@ i &apos;m--i &apos;m grounded again . shocker , i know .
but i &apos;m--i &apos;m not supposed to use the phone .
fine . well , i &apos;ll let you know
when i hear something about the antibiotics .
okay . cool .
you give someone something ?
hmm . only hours and hours of enjoyment .
thank you for that visual .
look , i &apos;m gonna go see serena .
does this mean she &apos;s finally out from under her father &apos;s spell ?
no , serena &apos;s in a good place . i mean , after palm beach ,
she stopped running away or keeping secrets .
i &apos;m glad .
oh , um , say hello to blair for me .
i hope she has a great day .
okay , do not do anything to mess with her date , please .
her date ?
with whom ?
you serious ?
you have all your spies , and you had to get it out of me ?
come on . you finally stopped defiling the pool table
with the entire cast of cirque du soleil .
you got blair into columbia .
why not let things end on a good note ?
look , i need to take this . and don &apos;t worry .
i have more important concerns
than blair &apos;s social life .
hey . so what can you tell me about the pills ?
we went over this . the only exception is schoolwork .
chuck bass is not giving you your homework assignments .
what ? dad , you can &apos;t take it . i didn &apos;t even do anything wrong .
well , it &apos;s nice to know i can spend my last night with vanessa
and come home to my family , fighting like they still live here .
don &apos;t know if you &apos;ve heard , but your sister &apos;s a drug dealer .
was . past tense . and you already grounded me for it .
wait . grounded to the loft ?
lily said she needed some time ,
so it was easier to bring jenny here .
and jenny would much rather be here anyway .
and jenny &apos;s dad thinks it &apos;s time for her to stop arguing
and go do her homework .
and talking about yourselves like you &apos;re not here is helping how ?
you know , i can &apos;t do my homework without my books .
i &apos;ll go to lily &apos;s and bring them back for you .
come with me ?
sure .
yeah , because dan loves being in the middle of these things .
special delivery .
you know , i &apos;m getting awfully spoiled having a doctor in the house .
although i am looking forward to drinking my apple juice straight .
i &apos;m surprised you can even stand the smell of that stuff
after being pregnant with serena .
you &apos;re right .
i did drink an awful lot of it during those months , didn &apos;t i ?
that green apple juice from that place down in the village .
what was it called again ?
i used to make you go all the way downtown to get it for me .
you didn &apos;t make me . i &apos;d go down there right now
if the juice craze wasn &apos;t over .
about that speech ...
d ... don &apos;t ... don &apos;t even say it .
i &apos;m sorry . i just got caught up in the moment ,
and it came out all wrong .
i was hoping that &apos;s what had happened .
and i &apos;m ... i &apos;m just so thrilled to get to know the kids .
you &apos;ve just done such an amazing job , lily .
really . you know , you ... you and rufus .
thank you .
i honestly don &apos;t know
how we &apos;d be getting through all of this without you .
oh , which reminds me ...
those homeopathic remedies are clogging up my humidifier .
want to check it out ?
yeah .
hello ?
you didn &apos;t answer your cell .
you mean my dad didn &apos;t . he took it .
lily &apos;s pills are ivermectin .
they &apos;re great at battling parasites
and african river blindness ,
but lymphoma , not so much .
well , is it dangerous ?
i mean , does she know what she &apos;s taking ?
what we need to find out is who prescribed them and when .
i wish i didn &apos;t rip the label off the bottle .
i don &apos;t remember what it said .
the date and the drug store were still legible ,
which was enough to track down the prescribing doctor .
luckily , pharmacists don &apos;t make enough to turn down bribes .
okay , so what &apos;s next ?
the mission requires an expert ,
someone highly trained
in the art of extorting information .
you &apos;re not seriously gonna use this to try to get back with blair .
my priority is the truth .
if she &apos;s the one who can expose it ...
then you &apos;ll take advantage of that to make sure she doesn &apos;t move on .
all right , i get it .
let &apos;s just hope she &apos;s willing to make herself available .
meet me at the waldorfs &apos; .
but wait . i &apos;m ...
grounded .
hey , lil ?
rufus , i didn &apos;t know you were coming over .
yeah , we &apos;re just picking up jenny &apos;s schoolbooks .
they &apos;re in her old room .
i thought my mom told you she needed some time .
i just want to check in and make sure we &apos;re still on
for that friends of the library thing tonight .
i &apos;m sorry , but if she wanted to talk to you ,
then she would call you back .
you should leave .
serena , does she have a problem seeing me or is it you ?
holland told me what happened .
about the sublet ? i told you already .
i didn &apos;t want your dad living in the same building .
you know it &apos;s not about that .
rufus . what &apos;s going on ?
i honestly don &apos;t know .
um , serena , what did holland tell you ?
why don &apos;t you just leave ?
you know what ? why don &apos;t we call holland ...
and have her tell us herself ?
i don &apos;t know what you want me to say .
well , serena &apos;s under the impression
that you know something about something i did .
i shouldn &apos;t be here .
come on . i have nothing to hide from my family .
just tell them the truth .
rufus and i slept together .
talk about love thy neighbor .
what ?
i &apos;m sorry .
next time , rufus
choose one who knows how to keep a secret .
this is absurd .
mom , i &apos;m sorry . i didn &apos;t want you to find out like this .
serena , this is not your fault .
lily , why don &apos;t you head upstairs , let me handle this ?
thank you , william . i &apos;m gonna take you up on that .
lily .
rufus .
dad .
i &apos;m sorry . i never meant to hurt anyone .
but it &apos;s probaly best now that the truth is out .
expect this isn &apos;t the truth . why would you say that ?
come on , eric . we don &apos;t need to hear this .
rufus , you can &apos;t expect me to stand here
and lie to their faces .
you just did .
you asked me to come up here .
you had to know it was going to happen .
excuse me . holland , right ?
this kind of stress is not good for lily .
please tell her i &apos;m sorry , again .
there &apos;s nothing to be sorry about . nothing happened .
i think you should leave , too , rufus .
you &apos;d love that , wouldn &apos;t you ?
the only place i &apos;m going is to see my wife .
what &apos;d i miss ?
lily , i &apos;m sorry .
i had no idea she was an insane person .
look , i don &apos;t want to discuss this with you .
wait . you actually believe her ?
what does she have to gain ,
standing here , humiliating herself in front of our family ?
i don &apos;t know what the hell &apos;s going on .
i just know she &apos;s lying .
yeah , well , it &apos;d be a lot easier to believe
if you hadn &apos;t left your scarf in her apartment .
we went over this .
i told you , nothing happened that night .
rufus , you , of all people ,
could understand why i might have a doubt .
you didn &apos;t talk to me for weeks after you found
that letter from william .
lily ,
maybe you would do that , but i wouldn &apos;t ,
and i didn &apos;t .
when you &apos;re ready to hear that and talk about it ,
give me a call .
so ... crazy day at the van der woodsens &apos; , huh ?
i just wanted to keep rufus away
until my mom got stronger .
well , you don &apos;t really think he did this , do you ?
why would holland lie about it ?
i don &apos;t know . i don &apos;t even know who she is .
but i do know rufus . i mean , he took me in
when my dad left us with nothing .
he &apos;s a good guy .
they all are , until they aren &apos;t anymore .
i &apos;m just trying to protect my mom .
i get it , okay ? but just give him a chance .
he gave you one when you bailed on brown .
are you really taking his side right now ?
i &apos;m not taking sides .
we &apos;re just talking about it .
well , maybe that &apos;s not such a good idea .
i have to go be with my family .
i still don &apos;t see why we need blair for this .
i mean , don &apos;t you read &quot; gossip girl &quot; ?
extortion &apos;s what i do all day .
this is more than headbands and high school .
the two of you here together ? please tell me
there &apos;s an explanation that doesn &apos;t involve the apocalypse .
we come in peace and with a purpose .
something &apos;s going on with lily &apos;s medication .
we need your mind game mastery to find out what .
who are you , house ?
i &apos;m sure dr. van der woodsen knows what he &apos;s doing .
it &apos;s not van der woodsen . it &apos;s a psychiatrist .
i have an address .
it &apos;s weird , right ?
lily so does not seem like she &apos;s in therapy .
and you so should be .
but as much as i admire the attempt to lure me back
with subversive sleuthing ,
and appreciative as i am of your help with columbia ,
the answer &apos;s no .
blair , i need to find out
why someone doesn &apos;t want lily getting better .
a heartfelt plea as well .
and much more effective than a fatwa .
but you obviously already know that i have a date today .
and nothing you can dangle will make me miss it .
next time ,
don &apos;t bring jenny humphrey .
i &apos;m sorry you had to find out about rufus like that .
i know you two have become close .
you know i &apos;m only concerned with how you &apos;re doing .
i &apos;m not sure . is that too honest ?
no . no , it makes sense .
well , you know , after five marriages ,
the last thing i want to do is
put you and serena through another divorce .
it might sound cold , but they do get easier .
rufus is different , you know ?
he &apos;s been like a father to you .
and i @-@ i love him . but if you think he cheated on you ,
you can &apos;t stay with him because of me .
you have to stay with him because you still love him
and because you think you guys can work through this .
it doesn &apos;t matter who you end up with
as long as you &apos;re still here .
well , thanks for coming with me , man .
it means a lot , you getting involved .
well , hey , my dad would have done this and worse .
all right , and no matter what serena wants to believe ,
there &apos;s no way rufus would hurt lily like that .
does serena know you &apos;re doing this ?
well , i was thinking we &apos;d see what we find out
before i tell her .
you &apos;re on dangerous ground there .
but the only way to clean up this mess , for everyone ,
is to find out the truth .
yeah , well ,
i @-@ i know . that &apos;s why we need the help of an expert .
philosophy of war ?
i &apos;m finally home .
nate ? humphrey ?
please don &apos;t tell me
my mother rehired you as a cater waiter .
i &apos;m dan .
cameron . hey , nate . great game last week .
thanks . sorry to interrupt .
we just need blair &apos;s help with something .
yes , people often drop by with their problems
because they know how supportive i am .
supportive , i.e. scheming .
did ... chuck send you ?
his pill plan didn &apos;t work , so he sent frick and frack
to ruin my date ?
no , blair , this is about my dad and lily .
this woman holland has accused him of ... cheating .
wait a minute .
an artist or a hippie activist , maybe ,
but rooftop garden committee ?
i knew that something wasn &apos;t right when serena told me .
no way would another upper east sider shtup rufus .
my stepfather &apos;s jewish .
blair , we can &apos;t let lily leave rufus .
will you help us ?
exposing scandal on the upper east side ?
show me your world , blair waldorf .
they &apos;d be lost without me .
tell me everything you know about this holland person .
trust me . i live with the van der woodsens .
i learned how to lie .
can i help you ?
we &apos;re here to see dr. kemble .
did you have an appointment ?
well , i work for a troubled teen hotline ,
and i &apos;m really worried that i said some wrong things about
drugs and depression , and was hoping that dr. kemble could
actually give me some advice .
of course . the doctor will be back next week .
next week ...
will be fine . thank you .
and what brings you and your mid @-@ level entourage ?
nothing personal .
we &apos;re looking for holland ,
who claims she slept with rufus .
let me guess--
dr. holland kemble ?
you better hope this doctor gets healed
before someone else gets hurt .
so what exactly am i looking for ?
a bottle of pills , like the one with the oxy--
hopefully , with the label on this time .
or something else that can directly link them to holland .
okay , i will rummage and report .
holland is obviously trying to poison lily so she can
have rufus all to herself . so shakespearean .
yeah . it &apos;s also &quot; fatal attraction . &quot;
i just can &apos;t handle dead bunnies .
maybe i &apos;m stating the obvious here ,
but shouldn &apos;t we just tell lily ?
tell her what ?
&quot; jenny tried to sell your mislabeled meds , which somehow
came from the woman who said she slept with your husband &quot; ?
no , we have to get to holland first .
she &apos;s the one who can connect all the dots ,
and then we go to lily .
holland will be at the library benefit tonight .
i saw it on the calendar .
perfect . public humiliation always helps
when trying to elicit a confession .
we don &apos;t expect you to keep up .
it &apos;s beyond basic rugby strategy .
so hopefully , jenny will find
something we can use as leverage .
exactly , humphrey .
glad to have you aboard this time .
all right . rendezvous at my place .
dress is black @-@ tie . i &apos;ll have tickets .
you guys do this kind of thing a lot ?
oh , yeah . a lot more than you &apos;d think .
last year , georgina pretended to be this rich canadian
to get poppy , but things got all messed up
when she turned her back on jesus .
yeah , but dan doesn &apos;t normally participate .
so that &apos;s your sorry @-@ your @-@ husband-
was @-@ cheating @-@ on @-@ you present-- a juicer ?
trust me . it &apos;ll make your mother smile .
sometimes i wish she would have
let you take us away from here when you wanted to .
tibet sounds pretty good right now .
only if you don &apos;t get typhoid .
besides , wherever you run , things still happen .
all you can do is try to learn from them .
well , as awful as it &apos;s been ,
maybe mom needed this
to see that she wasn &apos;t with the right man .
i &apos;m not gonna take advantage of the situation
to try to get closer to your mother .
well , you have been there throughout her entire sickness .
and this whole thing with rufus could have happened
so that you could finally stop hiding how you really feel .
i feel happy to be out shopping with my daughter ,
and to be able to spend some time
with the people that i love .
including mom .
serena .
good @-@ bye .
why don &apos;t you do something tonight to cheer her up ?
there &apos;s the library benefit . you could invite her .
only if you come , too .
what are you doing here ? no pills to steal in brooklyn ?
i actually came by to get a dress .
if you haven &apos;t destroyed them all already .
i have no interest in your wannabe want not be .
as i &apos;m sure you saw , your stuff is by the front .
and last time i checked , dresses weren &apos;t in the kitchen
near my mom &apos;s medicine .
do you even know what your dad &apos;s prescribing her ?
probably something with high street value
or you wouldn &apos;t be interested .
if you could just stop hating me for , like , one second ,
you &apos;d actually see i was trying to help your family .
yeah , yeah . you and your dad have done wonderful things
for us van der woodsens .
like it &apos;s been such a banner year for the humphreys ?
i would give it all back-- the clothes , the parties ,
the limo rides--just for one day that felt normal .
then why are you still here ?
you &apos;re right .
nothing would make me happier
than to go back to brooklyn forever .
was that jenny leaving ?
were you two fighting over rufus ?
i don &apos;t want you kids in the middle .
that was just jenny .
you know her-- all angst , all the time .
oh , god .
you okay ? do you want me to call dad ?
no , i &apos;m fine . i &apos;m fine physically .
sitting around here is only gonna make you worse .
dad invited us to the library benefit tonight .
why don &apos;t we go with him ?
oh , my god . a juicer ?
don &apos;t tell me ...
a night out with your father is exactly
what the doctor ordered .
i &apos;m sorry your new beau had to abandon our mission .
oh , he had a dinner with his rugby team .
how homoerotic .
you know how i love that .
we have plans to continue our date later .
so are you all ready to make the fat lady sing ?
i &apos;ll settle for making the lying doctor lady confess .
oh , here &apos;s nancy drew now . did you get our proof ?
come on , jenny .
the future of our family is riding on your sleuthing .
i &apos;m sorry . i looked everywhere , but there was nothing .
all right , what now ?
if we don &apos;t have evidence ,
she has no reason to tell us anything .
well , luckily , like every great general ,
i have contingency plans .
archibald ,
it &apos;s time to make use of those family connections .
watch out , lonely boy .
seems your little sister has her own ideas
about your family &apos;s planning .
serena is here . this complicates things .
we have to avoid them seeing us .
s. won &apos;t be on board ,
and we can &apos;t have a blonde bombshell blowing up our plan .
and the plan is we wait for nate and dan to arrive
with some a.m.a. guy
who &apos;s friends with nate &apos;s family ?
the plan is you wait with his ticket .
his name is dr . tabb ,
so pretend you &apos;re well @-@ bred and be polite .
it &apos;ll pay off if you ever need
orthopedic surgery at mount sinai .
like when you stab me in the back .
blair and i will keep our eye on holland .
once our leverage arrives ,
she &apos;ll either tell us the truth
or we tell dr . tabb ,
and he revokes her license .
i need a phone , too . my dad took mine .
don &apos;t worry , little . j.
you &apos;ll be back on park avenue in no time .
what are you doing ?
playing the part .
mnh @-@ mnh .
hi . uh , mount sinai orthopedic ?
please let dr . tabb know that there &apos;s no need to wait .
uh , nate archibald had a change of plans
and won &apos;t be coming in tonight .
thanks .
you know , i have to say , it &apos;s really nice to be here
with someone who doesn &apos;t hate these sort of things .
i have an idea .
i &apos;ve already had it .
dr. kemble , i &apos;ve been dying to get ahold of you .
i &apos;ve wanted to get him to come to therapy for weeks .
dad , what are you doing here ?
serena called me , but i was already on my way .
i figured if my grounded daughter goes missing ,
i just have to wait till the next big party
to know where to find her .
dad , i know you have no reason to believe me ,
but this time i &apos;m actually trying to help you .
jenny , is holland here ? oh , dad .
what &apos;d you say about holland ? is she here ?
the a.m.a. guy wasn &apos;t at the hospital ,
and blair &apos;s not picking up her phone .
if holland &apos;s here , i need to talk to her .
i &apos;ve been trying to reach her all day .
not a good idea .
and you don &apos;t have a ticket .
dad , you &apos;re not even dressed .
serena .
serena .
i know a scheme when i see one .
i assume chuck and blair are here somewhere ?
okay , yeah , they &apos;re looking for holland .
what was i supposed to do ?
i know rufus did not do this .
and you won &apos;t even give him a chance .
why should i ?
he wouldn &apos;t give my dad a chance .
oh , so that &apos;s it ?
anyone who might not like your dad has to go ?
nate , all i asked you to do was support me ,
and instead , you went behind my back .
it &apos;s not like that .
look , i get why everyone else did this .
dan and jenny don &apos;t want to believe that their dad cheated ,
chuck will do anything to get close to blair ,
and blair , as much as she wants to ,
can &apos;t run away from a game .
but you were supposed to be on my side .
as if watching audrey hepburn movies
isn &apos;t manhood @-@ shriveling enough ,
i now have to talk about my feelings ?
those movies are the only romance i have in my life .
he loves his work more than he loves me .
i &apos;m sorry .
i really prefer to see couples in my office .
why don &apos;t you call and make an appointment ?
please . please .
he traded me to his uncle ... for his hotel .
traded you ?
for sex .
please , is it any worse than you tricking me
into kissing a guy just so you can give a speech ?
that &apos;s not the same . he &apos;s kissed guys before .
she slept with jack ... my uncle .
clearly , you both have hurt each other ,
and now neither of you feel safe .
how can we rebuild ?
it &apos;s going to take a lot of hard work
and a lot of time .
are there any trust games involved ?
i &apos;m sorry . i really do have to go .
did i hear talk of games ?
please , just make an appointment .
just one more thing-- that man over there
is on the a.m.a. disciplinary committee .
last time i checked , it was illegal
to prescribe mislabeled medication ,
especially to those who aren &apos;t even your patients .
what ?
you two really are sick .
the person standing with him is waiting for my signal ,
to show him i have proof of what you did to lily humphrey .
just tell us why . are you in love with rufus ?
they say psychiatrists are the craziest ones .
blair ? what the hell is going on ?
would you like to tell him
or would you like dr. disciplinary to do it ?
i only wrote those prescriptions because i owed someone a favor .
the same someone who told you say you slept with me ?
the person you really need
to talk to is william van der woodsen .
where &apos;s will ?
what &apos;s so important , jenny ?
holland &apos;s about to tell them everything ,
if she hasn &apos;t already .
tell who what ?
everyone .
the truth about you and holland working together
to split up my dad and lily .
jenny , i &apos;m sorry.--
i know that you love your father very much
which is why i understand why you did it .
and i don &apos;t blame you for it either . it &apos;s just--
if you &apos;re gonna get out of here , you gotta go right now .
why are you telling me this ?
so you can get your family back ,
and i can get mine .
thanks for your help . i &apos;ll call if i hear about
any cater waiter positions , all right ?
have you seen lily ?
uh , she just left with serena and will .
in this family feud ,
that &apos;s van der woodsen , 1 , humphrey , 0 .
you guys are home early . was that boring ?
action @-@ packed , actually .
your father got a call .
he &apos;s gotta get back to palm beach .
one of my patients has taken a bad turn .
i &apos;ve gotta get down there right away .
and we &apos;re going with him .
you guys get packed .
i &apos;ll arrange for a helicopter to take us to teterboro .
eric , mom needs us right now .
this is our chance to finally be a family .
i &apos;ll , uh ,
i &apos;ll go get my stuff .
nate already tried calling .
there &apos;s no reason to defend your dad .
we &apos;re already packing for palm beach .
i just want my mom to be able to put this behind her .
serena , i &apos;m not calling about my dad .
i &apos;m calling about yours . please don &apos;t hang up .
pl--i @-@ i know how happy you are to have him back ,
but he &apos;s the one who got holland to lie about the affair ,
and he had her prescribe pills for lily , too .
dan , my dad is a doctor .
why would he need holland to give her pills ?
because the pills aren &apos;t helping her illness ,
and he didn &apos;t want them traced back to him .
okay , what you &apos;re saying is just crazy .
any crazier than your whole family leaving town with him tonight ?
i &apos;m gonna go . good @-@ bye .
serena , wait--
you all set ? my bags are downstairs .
yeah , um , you know , i was thinking
maybe we could just wait and , uh , fly out tomorrow .
i wish we could . i &apos;ve got to get to my patient immediately .
are you sure that &apos;s what it &apos;s about ?
people are saying you &apos;re behind this holland thing .
holland ?
um , let me go check on mom .
rufus , what are you doing here ?
i &apos;d like to talk to your mother .
she doesn &apos;t want ...
rufus , what is it ?
the truth , finally .
you want to tell her or should i ?
so serena &apos;s father sends her this letter saying that
he and lily were together when she came to see him ...
hoping it would cause problems between lily and my dad ,
maybe even split &apos; em up .
when that failed , he went to plan &quot; b ... &quot;
getting holland to be friend of rufus .
holland &apos;s husband was leaving her ,
and she was desperate for a friend . but once again ,
rufus and lily proved too solid ,
so on to plan &quot; c . &quot;
there &apos;s a plan &quot; c &quot; ?
oh , i always have a plan &quot; c . &quot;
put yourself in the good doctor &apos;s loafers .
lily comes to him over the summer . she &apos;s actually sick .
he cures her , falls in love , decides to win her back ,
only holland tells him
lily and rufus are copper @-@ bottom .
he thinks , &quot; what can i do to get her to love me ,
the family to accept me ? &quot;
save her life . so the pills he gets from holland ...
... the ones you stole .
antibiotics .
the side effects of which mimic her symptoms .
he cures her again , gets to be the hero ,
and they live happily ever after .
no wonder you admire him .
it &apos;s almost like something you would do .
thank you . it does have the fingerprints of my genius .
the only question now is ...
will lily believe my dad ?
lily , this is absurd . you cannot believe his lies .
should i call holland ? this time she &apos;ll tell the truth .
so you get your mistress to change her
story and ...
hey . is my mom really sick ?
right now that &apos;s all i wanna know .
of course she was sick .
uh , to ... to even imagine that i would prescribe your mother
medication that she didn &apos;t need ? it &apos;s preposterous .
i &apos;ve got the files in my bag .
do you want to see them ?
you don &apos;t have to prove yourself .
apparently , i do .
excuse me .
william .
i didn &apos;t cheat on you , lily .
i would never cheat on you .
rufus .
so she &apos;s not sick ? i just want to be clear .
she &apos;s not sick anymore .
he &apos;s been lying since he got to new york , to all of us .
do you think he &apos;s even coming back ?
yes , of course he is . you heard what he said .
and i &apos;m ... i &apos;m sorry , mom . i don &apos;t want you to be sick .
but dad is not lying to us .
where &apos;s william ?
he @-@ he &apos;s in the lobby downstairs getting his bags .
there &apos;s no one in the lobby .
he &apos;s down there .
serena , the lobby &apos;s empty .
you ... you just must not have seen him . he wouldn &apos;t leave .
he wouldn &apos;t leave me .
let her go .
oh , god .
we should call the police .
all right , well , let &apos;s just give him a minute .
no . if we wait , he &apos;ll be gone for good .
yes , captain lewis ? this is nate archibald .
we met at my grandfather &apos;s this summer .
listen , i need a favor .
what i &apos;d like to know is how did william know to get out of town ?
someone must have tipped him off .
it had to be one of us .
it was me .
what happened ?
it &apos;s true . he left .
i need you to tell me the truth .
when your mother came to me last summer , she was sick .
i cured her .
then i fell in love with her again .
when i came here and saw you and eric ,
i ... i realized how badly i had messed up .
i never wanted to hurt any of you .
i just wanted my family back .
all you needed to do was be here .
i &apos;m sorry , serena .
i just thought unless your mother needed me ...
you weren &apos;t gonna give me a chance .
well , the police are on their way now ,
so you should probably go .
why don &apos;t you come with me ?
i don &apos;t forgive you .
i also don &apos;t need to punish you.so if you just go now ,
i &apos;ll make sure they don &apos;t come after you .
i love you , serena .
i love you , too , dad .
go now .
rufus , i &apos;m sorry i didn &apos;t believe you .
i was just so overwhelmed .
the only thing that matters is i &apos;m not losing you ...
to cancer , to will or anything else .
really ? that &apos;s it ?
dad , she believed you cheated .
she was leaving with her ex @-@ husband .
and you helped make that happen .
you know , you think that william &apos;s the only problem ?
he &apos;s not , dad . you and lily fight all the time .
i mean , one of you thinks the other &apos;s cheating .
you both keep secrets .
jenny , that &apos;s between me and lily .
you know , i wish it was ,
but we all get dragged into it , just like we did today .
when we lived in brooklyn , i might have had
to take the subway to school and make my own clothes ,
but at least our family was happy .
i don &apos;t see what &apos;s so wrong about wanting my life
to go back to normal .
this is where we live .
what needs to get back to normal is you .
if you don &apos;t want to be a part of this family ,
no one is forcing you to stay .
you don &apos;t have to wait with me .
lily is fine , and the sting is over .
you &apos;re not really going to keep up this rugby player facade .
it &apos;s not a facade .
it &apos;s a date , and he &apos;s on his way .
i know you felt it .
we were caught up in a scheme ,
and it was role @-@ play .
it was real .
i know you feel it right now .
it doesn &apos;t change anything .
and holland may be crazy , but she was right .
no matter what i feel or don &apos;t ,
we &apos;re not safe .
i did the most dangerous thing i could
when i said &quot; i love you , &quot;
and it was worth it .
if i got through my fear for you ,
you can get through yours for me .
you have until tomorrow to decide .
what ?
we &apos;re never going to be safe .
so are you brave enough or aren &apos;t you ?
i &apos;ll be waiting at the top of the empire state building .
you can &apos;t &quot; affair to remember &quot; me .
if you &apos;re not there tomorrow ,
at 7 : 01 , i &apos;m closing my heart to you forever .
well , i won &apos;t be there .
how &apos;d the sting go ?
i &apos;d much rather hear about rugby .
fair enough . rugby is a real sport .
football &apos;s for ...
hello ?
hey . i &apos;ve been calling you .
there &apos;s nothing more to say .
i got to my dad before the cops did .
so i guess now you know
why i don &apos;t talk to you about things .
thanks for coming with me .
when are things not complicated
with serena van der woodsen ?
you want to talk about it ?
when the family tree falls ,
we all need a friend to lead us out of the woods ...
or into them .
i didn &apos;t know you &apos;d be here . i live here .
i know . i just thought you &apos;d , um , be with serena or something .
nope .
but careful ...
once darkness descends , true natures emerge ,
and everything is fair game until morning .
