Boy, it must be rough having too much money.
Wait, hold on. Don't lock it yet.
Yeah, there we go.
That makes four.
You're eating all the profits.
How'd you ever even get a license?
'cause I look good in a suit.
How long has the parking lot camera been down?
I have no idea. Isn't that your job?
Finish locking up, would ya?
I'm gonna go check out the camera.
I will not be going home tonight if that thing's busted.
‭Jane!
What is it? What's wrong?
What -- what's wrong? What are you doing here?
I-I was just stopping by.
You were watching us.
No.
How long have you been sneaking in?
It's not sneaking. I have a key.
I understand the nervousness, but this is not a solution.
It's just until we catch him, Maura.
You need to talk to someone.
Melanie has been really helpful.
She's given me a lot of tools
to help me cope with having been abducted.
Every time I feel anxious or scared,
I just write it in my journal.
It's a way of avoiding the onset of P.T.S.D.
So what are you doing up in the middle of the night?
It's a process.
All right, well, we'll see how your therapy goes,
and maybe I'll consider talking to somebody.
Your jacket is so wrinkled.
Quit it!
You could have ironed it.
You have bags under your eyes.
I don't have bags under my eyes. Do -- do I?
Gotcha.
Anyone hungry?
You know, I bet those aren't like the kind my mom makes.
Come on.
Body's back there.
What? Robbery gone bad?
First unit on the scene
talked to the security guard, Jeff Collins.
He said he and the owner, Otis Reynolds,
were closing up for the night.
Should she be back so soon?
W--
Yeah. It's good for her to get into her regular routine.
Keeps her mind focused.
What's with the security cameras?
Collins noticed that
the parking lot camera was malfunctioning.
When he went to check it out,
two masked guys with guns were at the door,
forced their way in.
Do we know how they disabled the cameras?
Wiring appears intact.
We're taking it back to the crime lab.
Collins said Reynolds was trying to lock the safe,
and the bad guys came in and that one started shooting.
Mm, to keep Otis from locking everything up.
Otis took a round to the head.
Is he alive?
Surgeon said it's a miracle he's still alive, but he is.
Our victim has a single close contact gunshot wound
to the chest, no exit wound.
What about the guard?
Took one to the chest and still managed to shoot our dead guy.
The vest saved his life, but he is hurtin'.
He passed out, called 9-1-1 when he came to.
He didn't say anything about the second guy?
No, just that it happened in the blink of an eye.
Well...
If the accomplice is trying to get to the money,
I mean, he -- he would've left a bloody footprint.
Well, maybe the gunplay scared him off.
Yeah.
Hey, can you bag that up and get it to the crime lab?
Maybe our accomplice needed something to calm his nerves.
And that's a lot of dough.
And until the state and federal drug laws
catch up to each other,
little places like this are always gonna have
a lot of cash lying around.
It's a gold rush.
It's a green rush.
And with that much green,
there's always gonna be someone who wants to steal it.
You're tracking airline flights?
No.
This is about not being able to find a link
between Maura's kidnapper, Joe Harris, and Jane.
Since Harris leads us nowhere, I circled back to the hacker
who broke into your sister's bank accounts.
Hoping that he can lead us to whoever's behind all this.
Exactly. This is wingate bouncing.
Hacker's hiding his I.P. address
by bouncing the signal to hundreds of servers.
The only thing I've learned so far
is how badly this guy does not want to be found.
Speaking of found, you got anything on our dead robber?
Theodore "Teddy" White.
35 years old from Charlestown.
Two-bit thief, marijuana dealer.
Did time for both.
He's been caught for almost everything he's ever done.
Someone should've told him to pick another line of work.
Any luck with the other videos we pulled?
No. The Pot Palace parking lot camera was down.
None of the city traffic cameras caught anything,
and I came up empty on private security cameras in the area.
All right, yeah, e-mail Maura and Jane this stuff on White.
I'm gonna start the paperwork on a search warrant.
Maybe we'll have better luck at his apartment.
There once was a man from Kent,
whose name, in fact, was Kent.
Mm, ceiling is eating Kent. Good.
Be happy I'm not wearing the kilt today.
He's fixing the exhaust fan.
What about a call to maintenance?
Oh, that would take a month. Besides, this satisfies
the basic male need to fix things.
For your information,
I once made an air conditioner
of a laptop fan and some ice cubes.
So I've got this, okay?
We'll see.
Look what I found in Teddy White's pocket.
A laser pointer.
And if directed at the camera lens,
the concentrated beam literally blinds the camera
by destroying the C.C.D./C.M.O.S. sensor.
So the camera can't "C-anymore." Get it?
I'm okay!
Ballistics confirmed that Collins' gun killed Teddy White.
Okay.
And all the other bullets came from White's gun.
And there are no prints on the gun either.
Great.
What about the bloody brownie?
Uh, still being processed for D.N.A.,
but more than likely, it's Otis'.
The hospital tox screen
showed high levels of T.H.C. in his blood.
Shocking.
Well, all this talk of brownies
makes me realize I haven't eaten. Lunch?
I can't. I gotta interview a witness.
But I'll catch you later.
Gotta stop meeting like this.
Dr. Kaplan, you say the sweetest things.
No, really. Someday, we have to meet in my office.
People do it all the time.
They call, they make an appointment,
they come in and lie on my couch.
Come and see for yourself.
I-I like this spot.
It affords you a 360-degree view of your surroundings,
and it's not patrolled by Boston cops.
Well, you're a...doctor.
You should know that sunshine is good for you.
And, you know, it's...
Not like I see you every Tuesday at 10:00, so...
12 meetings in 5 years
is enough to constitute a professional relationship.
Next time in my office.
Fine, but I'm not bringing you coffee.
I, uh, read about Dr. Isles' abduction.
I'm guessing that's why you're here.
You find it difficult
to see someone you care about in danger?
Well, yeah. It's -- it's...
hard to see a-a strong woman like Maura,
you know, just...
crippled by fear and anxiety.
It's...
she's starting to lose her confidence.
She's second-guessing herself.
Dr. Isles is not my client. You are.
I'm asking about you.
No, I'm fine.
I-I-I am fine.
Then why'd you want to see me?
You know, I remember when you first called me
to come meet you here.
Those scars were very new.
Yeah, it was, uh...
Right after I caught Hoyt.
Some wounds heal with stitches and a band-aid.
Others require more time.
All of them require a helping hand.
I'm not wounded.
Professor Gray. I read your smackdown of the hackers
who broke into the S.S.A. Computers.
Pissed and fighting for the good guys.
I figured the guy who wrote that article
would help me stop someone from hurting
a cop's family and friends.
What? Oh.
Yes, that was absolutely... horrible.
What is it you wanted me to do again?
I know how this hacker hides.
I just don't know how to find him.
The trick is to find that piece of himself
that every hacker leaves in their work.
A signature.
Where do I find that?
If the hacker's good, you never find it.
And this guy's good.
Professor Gray?
There must be something I can do.
Yes. Yes, there is. Leave this stuff with me.
I thought you said we'd never find his signature.
No, I said you would never find it.
I did not say I couldn't.
It's three broken ribs...
bruised spleen, and some...
major blunt force trauma.
You feel up to looking at a photo?
I'll do whatever I can to help.
You seen him before?
Customer, maybe? Hanging around the parking lot?
No.
I can't believe I just opened the door.
I just let him walk right in and --
Don't blame yourself.
I just came by here to thank you.
The surgeon said getting Otis to the hospital when they did
saved his life.
You saved his life, Jeff.
I didn't mean to interrupt.
I'm Christine Reynolds, Otis's wife.
Sergeant Vince Korsak, Boston homicide.
How is your husband doing?
Still in a coma.
Did you work at the Pot Palace, too?
Yes, I work there.
Mostly bookkeeping at home,
but I work behind the counter two or three days a week.
Have you seen anything strange around the store this week?
Someone hanging around outside?
No.
Were there any problems with employees?
No, we have four... part-timers
and... my husband and me, sergeant.
and Otis wanted it that way --
a small, owner-operated corner store.
Did Otis owe anyone money?
Anyone that might have robbed the store to get it back?
Oh, god, no.
Do you recognize him?
I've never seen him before.
Otis is the most wonderful, peaceful man.
No one would want to hurt him.
Oh! Jane, I was just trying to find you.
What's up?
No, d--
Stay.
Now before you get to your desk,
I just want you to know that, uh...
Martinez.
Martinez is here.
Hi!
So, to what do I owe the pleasure?
I mean -- I mean, not... My pleasure.
I-I mean, everyone's pleased, I'm sure.
He's not. Um...But...
Hola.
Hi.
Mm-kay.
As you all know,
I've been on loan to the D.E.A. task force.
We've been working a series of robberies
along the Massachusetts border.
Small crew hitting
small town, mom-and-pop medical marijuana operations.
Makes sense. Small towns, small police departments.
They don't have the personnel
to handle that kind of operation.
You think your crew hit the Pot Palace?
Possibly. Two masked man enter near closing time
when there were no customers,
grabbing the cash and the marijuana on display.
Our guys were in and out in 35 seconds.
Can we tie Teddy White to these crimes?
Not yet.
This is where we thought they would hit next. Nina?
A small dispensary in Wellesley, right off route 9.
D.E.A.'s already set up on the place.
You guys want in?
Dude, what if I smoke this all up and I don't like it?
Is there, like, some kind of refund policy?
Sure is, dude.
Just return the smoke in this jar,
and we'll totally give you a refund.
That's really cool, dude.
Far out, right?
‭ Yeah!
Yeah, right on, man.
Note to self -- I hate retail.
You look tired.
Well, sitting in a car watching nothing is boring.
You know, I heard about what happened.
How you doing?
I'm all right. I'm just tired.
I've been sleeping on Maura's couch,
trying to keep an eye on things.
Wouldn't surveillance cameras be easier?
Yes, but there's a hacker involved,
and I'm worried about him stealing the signal, so...
You talking to anyone?
You can't be serious.
Hey, why not?
After that incident in Dorchester,
I saw a therapist for a few months.
I was having pretty bad dreams.
I know. I remember.
So?
In my dream,
I chase a killer into a-a crowd of people.
But I can't see any faces.
I-I can't see who's good or who's bad,
and I just keep spinning.
And I just keep circling, and...
And then, I-I don't see the knife until it's too late.
And then I wake up.
What do you think it means?
In the dream, if...
I just had a little more time...
You know? Like, I-I could see his face. I could catch him.
But he's always just out of reach.
It's...
Maybe you need to let someone else carry the ball for a while.
My family is in danger.
You know this guy isn't gonna stop.
Then I guess you're gonna have to find him.
Get ready. They're here.
Boston Police. Drop it or die.
Your partner's dead.
What the hell? When did that happen?
The night you hit the Pot Palace.
Wanna explain the gun in your waistband?
I found that. I didn't want some kid to pick it up.
You're a nice guy, helping out the community like that.
That's why I gave my friend a ride to the store.
Do you know just being a lookout is felony murder?
Do you know that?
Life in prison, no parole.
Look...
I don't know what happened, okay, in that store,
But I-I-I-I didn't hurt anybody.
I'm a thief. A thief. Not a killer, all right?
You tell us what happened inside of Pot Palace.
We talk to the D.A., maybe they knock it down to accessory.
I wasn't in the Pot Palace. I've never been there.
Where were you last night around midnight?
In Brockton,
at the Motel 24 with Todd.
Brockton.
This little place called, uh, uh, 24 Motel.
Uh, Wally and I, we were there all night.
We ordered some pizza, had a little party with some girls.
What are their names?
Jasmine and, um...
Ah. Cinnamon.
Yeah, Cinnamon.
Cinnamon.
You okay?
Yeah, I just need to get some sleep.
For, like, a week or two.
You should let me take Ma home tonight.
All right, spill the beans. What's going on?
She's been taking our mother home every night after her shift.
Well, no wonder you're so tired.
You can't burn your candle at both ends like that.
That's what I told her.
Do you have any useful information,
or are you just trolling the halls, causing problems?
Wally Johnson and Todd Davis' phone records.
They were in the area of all of the out-of-state robberies.
But not the Pot Palace?
I went to Brockton this morning.
Wally and Todd checked into the Motel 24
the night of the robbery,
left the next morning.
Pizza delivery guy I.D.'d 'em from their photos.
So the Pot Palace wasn't them.
Lieutenant Martinez left this for you at the front desk.
Thank you.
睡个好觉
Hey, baby.
Hi, Ma.
What's that?
Wireless cameras.
Paid for by the D.E.A.
Don't touch.
N.S.A. crypto technology prevents anyone from intercepting the signal.
Oh. Does that mean you're gonna start sleeping?
Or are you going to watch cameras all night long?
When I'm not watching, someone else will.
Who?
What?
Jane, this has got to stop.
You are not responsible for me or Maura.
Okay, this is about someone who is trying to hurt,
potentially kill, the people that I love.
Someone that I'm in charge of finding. Okay?
But for all we know, whoever was behind this
could've been scared off when Joe Harris died.
What if he wasn't?
As requested, a random sampling of product from the Pot Palace.
For investigatory purposes only.
I never doubted it.
You say this has to do with some inconsistency?
Well, the government-sanctioned suppliers are required by law
to maintain a specific level of T.H.C. in all their products.
Yet, the bloody brownie I was testing for D.N.A.
had a significantly higher level of T.H.C. than allowed.
Meaning what?
Otis was selling non-sanctioned products in his store?
Well, the discrepancy could be an aberration
in the manufacturing process.
I'll know for sure once I test the T.H.C. levels
in these samples.
When you say "Test,"
Uh, exactly how do you do that?
Well, we do burn it in a controlled environment
with proper ventilation.
It's all very scientific, I promise.
Anything new on Wally and Todd?
Well, no, we have found no connection
between Wally and Todd and Teddy White.
Maybe it's a copycat.
Yeah.
But how does a two-bit loser
who can barely plan a subway ride know how
to disable a security camera with a laser pointer?
Did we find any connection
between Teddy White and the employees at the store?
Not yet, but Nina's still working on it.
We gotta find an accomplice.
Hey, Maura, what's up?
No, I do not have Prince Albert in a can.
Yes, my refrigerator is running.
Where are you?
Are you in the lab?
Y-you know, if you could just stop with the laughing, I...
Why can you not trust atoms?
Because they make up everything.
You've got the fan pushing the smoke in.
You wired the fan wrong.
You wired the fan bong!
You know, just interesting fact --
That might be the biggest bong in history.
Okay. Let's go.
Get up! Get up, get up.
Get up! Get up!
Get out! Get out!
Oh! I'm over here.
The tests that I've been running on the edibles...
Mm-hmm. Oh, I'm so hungry!
What are you doing?
Looking for corn curls.
In my hair?
Yeah.
Corn curls in your curls!
Maura... Focus.
Okay?
Okay.
Tell me about... Hmm.
The tests on the edibles.
On the edibles. Mm-hmm.
Oh, yeah!
Some of Otis' brownies
did not come from his government supplier.
He was gettin' some m.j. from the street.
Word.
I can't. Just...
Oh, you know, I have never told you this before...
Oh, god.
But I love
glazed doughnuts.
Okay! I'll...
I will get you some.
Oh, hey, hey, hey. Shh! Shh! Shh!
Nina, can you send the phone records
from Otis and the Pot Palace over to Martinez, please?
Thanks so much! Bye!
Do you know what a scientist plants in his garden?
No.
A chemistree! A chemistree!
So how's the 420 Gang doing?
Fine, once I got 'em six bags of chips and some fresh air.
Okay, so it's pretty obvious from Maura's report
that Otis is supplementing his brownie inventory.
It's a good plan.
Sell your own home-baked brownies,
cut the government out of it, pocket a bunch of tax-free cash.
Yeah, all he'd need is a street dealer.
And for someone who sells legal marijuana for a living,
how hard could that be to find?
If Otis was stupid enough to burn someone in a deal,
it wouldn't surprise me if that robbery was staged.
Otis is killed, the dispute is resolved,
and it doesn't kick back on the dealer.
I sent the Pot Palace phone records
to Martinez and the D.E.A. like you asked.
He cross-referenced them
against their database of suspected dealers.
They got a hit.
I have never seen an operation this big in Boston.
Say thanks to the modern marvel of advanced hydroponics.
You're mixing up the sativa and the indica with the hybrids.
Who's in charge here?
We are.
All right, well, you --
Can you tell me what the hell is going on here?
Because you're taking, like, all of my product.
Well, it's illegal to grow and sell marijuana.
Not anymore.
It's legal in the state of Massachusetts.
If you have a grower's permit.
Do you have yours handy, Charlie?
No, I -- look, I got a friend. He was gonna get it to me.
Okay, you know what?
No one cares about your weed, all right?
You can discuss that with the D.E.A.
All I care about is murder.
Murder?
Was the robbery at the Pot Palace
a setup to kill Otis Reynolds?
Wait, wait. What are you talking about?
You killing Otis Reynolds
because he stiffed you on a deal.
God, no.
If somebody stiffed me, I just --
I-I wouldn't sell to them again.
Well, that's big of you.
Hey, look around,
I've got plenty of product to cover a loss.
It's not like I'm gonna kill somebody over it.
You sure of that?
Look at me, bro. I mean, do I look like Pablo Escobar?
I mean...
Anyway, it's not -- not the way it was with Otis.
He was -- he was a solid customer.
When's the last time you saw him?
15 years ago.
Otis and I did a little business together
when we were in college.
And then, you know, we drifted apart.
But he called me, like, five months ago.
How did he get your number?
This is the house I grew up in.
And so, like, the number's not changed.
And Otis called 'cause
he wanted to do me business together again.
But he didn't want to meet face-to-face,
so he just left the money at the drop-off,
and I dropped off, you know, the package. Legally.
I'm gonna look around.
Yeah.
Can we trust you with this?
Considering my body weight
and the fact that I am not a regular marijuana smoker,
I do believe that the effects
of the inhalation event have passed.
And given my lack
of a genetic predisposition to addiction,
I don't have any overwhelming desire
to smoke marijuana again.
But I'm not so sure about Kent.
He did seem to enjoy the effects.
Oh, yeah. No, you are the picture of decorum.
Okay, can you test that, please,
and see if that's the same marijuana
that we found in the illegal brownies?
Well, if I can extract plant D.N.A.
from the illegal brownies, then I can compare the two.
If not, all I can test is the same T.H.C. Levels.
And that won't prove conclusively
that the samples are the same.
Angela told me about the cameras.
Yeah?
I don't want them in my house. I don't want to be watched.
Okay, Maura, the cameras aren't --
Jane, stop worrying about us.
It's unhealthy.
Is it as unhealthy as being kidnapped?
Or killed?
My therapist showed me something. It might help you.
Oh, I can hardly wait.
The glass is life.
The rocks are the bad things that happen.
It looks like there's no room left in the glass,
But...
The water
is the good things in life.
And you --we-- need to focus on the good things.
What if somebody takes your glass?
Is it a bad thing that I'm being security-conscious
after everything that's happened?
Maura and your mother aren't cops, Jane.
They don't think they way we do. It's just the way it is.
Oh, speaking of your mother...
What?
Did she ask you to say something to me? What?
No, no, no, not at all.
I was just gonna say I'm at the Robber most nights.
I can give Angela a ride home.
She didn't put you up to this?
On my dogs. It's just my way of watching your back.
Thank you.
Listen, when you drop her off,
you just gonna take a look around --
I got your back.
Okay.
Got the list of everything Charlie Douglas sold to Otis.
From what he bought,
Otis could've baked enough pot brownies to net
at least $250,000 tax-free.
Did you find an extra 250 grand in the pot palace safe?
Nope, all the money in the safe
balanced with the business receipts.
But the records do show a drop in sales
if they're legit brownies.
Which is what we'd expect if Otis was pushing his product
instead of the government's.
Well, Otis owned one of only six dispensaries in Boston.
That's worth millions of dollars even after he paid taxes.
Yeah, so why do something that would cost you your license
or end you up in jail?
Is it possible that Otis wasn't the one
goosing the inventory?
I mean, Charlie said that he hadn't seen him in years.
And Otis wouldn't meet with him face-to-face this time.
You thinking an employee pretending to be Otis
picked up some brownies
and sold 'em at the Pot Palace on his own?
Maybe Otis found out, was gonna turn them in.
That's certainly motive to want him dead.
Anything yet?
No, nothing we don't already know.
Otis did a great job running background checks
on these people before he hired them.
Thank you.
It looks like all of the employees are clean.
No new purchases, no investment accounts.
Jane told us to run checks on all the employees, right?
She did.
Well, the wife, Christine, is also a part-time employee.
Christine Reynolds had one credit card,
but it's been paid off.
Account's been closed since the Pot Palace opened.
Looks like they pay cash for everything now.
What was Christine's maiden name?
Johnson.
Okay.
There it is, at the same bank.
A holiday account for a Christine Johnson.
The account also comes with a free safe deposit box.
$240,000.
Uniforms picked Christine up at her house.
They're bringing her in.
So she was sneaking in the illegal brownies
and selling 'em right under her husband's nose.
It appears so.
Why would she steal from her husband?
Maybe she was leaving him.
Even though his name was the only one on the license,
wouldn't she still have a stake in the profits
if they got divorced?
In an ongoing business,
her stake would be less than half, if that.
Best she could hope for is a decent alimony settlement.
But in an all-cash business, Otis could play with the books,
cut her out of thousands of dollars.
She didn't come up with this on her own.
Someone pretended to be Otis
when they were talking to Charlie.
And this...
This is her protection against Otis being pissed
because she wasn't just leaving him,
She was having an affair.
We didn't find a burner phone
when we searched her house and her car.
No e-mails or love letters on her computer.
Most of the calls from her cell phone
were to and from the Pot Palace.
And there's no connection between Christine
and Teddy White or any of his known associates.
We don't even know whether it was a robbery
or an attempt to kill Otis.
Let's ask her.
Did Otis know you were stealing from him?
Is that why you staged the robbery?
Or did he find out about the affair you were having?
The two of you decided to kill Otis
so you could start a new life, didn't you?
I would never hurt Otis.
I may not love him anymore, but I would never hurt him.
Oh, sure you would, especially if you found out
that he was trying to cut you out of your share of the store.
The store was Otis's dream, not mine.
I don't want part of the store.
You expect us to believe that?
It's the truth.
Then why were you stealing from him?
The money...
was just to get away,
Start a new life.
With who?
Yeah, and run the employee records against the schedule, okay?
Thanks.
What's up?
Uh, so, just wanna let you know
that we've tied Johnson and Davis
to all the other dispensary robberies.
But not the Pot Palace?
No.
So you haven't helped me at all with my murder investigation.
You sleeping any better?
Mm, no.
But thanks for asking.
Maura's allergic to surveillance.
My money's on you, Jane.
Call me if you're up in the middle of the night.
Especially if you're up in the middle of the night.
I'm not gonna do that.
I wish you would.
You're the best, kiddo.
Thanks.
What'd you find?
I ran the schedules of the employees,
and you were right.
Christine didn't need to call her boyfriend
'cause she saw him all the time.
Her schedule overlaps a lot with Jeff Collins, the guard.
Most of their days off match.
And the number of calls from the Pot Palace
to the Reynolds' home were higher
when Otis was working than when he wasn't.
They also correspond to the days that Collins was working.
How much you wanna bet he was calling her
right under Otis' nose?
And...
Yes? Something else? Mm-hmm.
I couldn't find a connection
between Christine and Teddy White,
so I took another look at Jeff Collins.
Right here.
They went to the same gym.
Where's Jane?
Uh, she's a little tied up, asked me to get the results.
Well, uh, there is a significant quantity of gunshot residue
on the inside of the right and left sleeves.
Is the gunpowder the same?
The G.S.R. on both sleeves has the same chemical signature
as the gunpowder from Teddy White's weapon.
Yeah, same as when I ran the first test.
If he held a gun like this, shot himself,
that would explain how gunshot residue
got on both sleeves, right?
Yes, or he could've been involved in a scuffle
with Teddy White, like he said he was.
Jane thinks Jeff Collins shot himself.
Staged the whole thing to look like a hero,
take the suspicion off himself.
Well, I know you don't want to hear this,
but there is no science to confirm that theory.
The only thing I want to confirm right now
is whether or not Christine knew
that Collins was gonna shoot Otis.
Your boyfriend Jeff shot and killed Teddy White,
and he shot your husband in the head.
I don't believe you.
You're just trying to blame him for the robbery
because you can't solve it.
You were in the hospital room
when Jeff said he didn't know Teddy White, remember?
Jeff would never...
Think about it.
He was obsessed with how much money
Otis was making at the dispensary, wasn't he?
And it was his idea to sell the brownies, wasn't it?
And he's the one who called Charlie Douglas
pretending to be Otis, wasn't he?
Did he tell you how screwed you were gonna get?
Did he tell you how Otis would end up with the entire store,
and you'd get stiffed on the alimony?
Did he tell you any of that?
No, no.
Jeff would never hurt Otis.
Okay.
She just can't accept that Jeff set this all up.
You think she was in on it?
I think she loves Jeff,
but I don't think she'd be in on a plan to kill Otis.
Okay, thanks.
Jeff Collins was released from the hospital this morning.
I have a unit standing by Otis's room.
I checked. Collins has three handguns
and two rifles registered to him.
Might not be the kind of guy
to take our suspicions lying down.
I know that you don't wanna believe
that your boyfriend shot and killed your husband.
He wouldn't.
Okay, well, help me prove that.
Call Jeff and tell him
that Otis is gonna make a full recovery.
We moved him, Jeff, put the rifle down.
Do it the easy way. Put the gun down.
I can't believe she set me up.
Christine didn't set you up.
She just couldn't believe you're a murderer.
Tell Christine I'm sorry.
I've never used one of these things before.
This is great!
I mean, is he all right?
Yeah, he's all right.
I swear, Jane, this is the last time I'm gonna show up
unless you have something to say.
You said that last time.
I'm afraid.
Now we're gettin' somewhere.
I'm sorry I took your rocks.
They weren't really my rocks.
They belong to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.
I gave them to Korsak for his turtles.
He is so busted.
I still have the glass.
I shouldn't have played amateur psychiatrist.
It was wrong of me.
It was fine.
I'm only watching you two
because I'm afraid that I can't catch this guy.
I mean, he's been ahead of me every step of the way.
What if I'm just not good enough to catch him?
But what if you are?
