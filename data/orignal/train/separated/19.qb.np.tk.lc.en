the good wife s01e02
an hour ago , i resigned as state &apos;s attorney of cook county .
are you still involved with prostitutes , sir ?
thanks for playing the breadwinner for a while .
it &apos;s not gonna last forever .
i just wanted to say thank you for the opportunity .
glad you could come aboard .
not only are you coming back to the workplace fairly late ,
but you have some very prominent baggage .
but , hey , if she can do it , so can you .
kalinda sharma .
oh , the investigator .
you &apos;re peter florrick &apos;s wife .
that &apos;s right .
last time i was in court was 13 years ago .
wow , i was 12 .
state &apos;s attorney &apos;s here .
i &apos;m glenn childs .
peter blames me for his downfall .
don &apos;t make yourself collateral damage here .
the day you leaked that sex tape
to the pressand forced me to shield my children ,
that was the day i became collateral damage .
you &apos;ve obviously never made a woman angry before .
an hour ago , i resigned as state &apos;s attorney of cook county .
but i do admit to a failure of judgment
in my dealings with these women .
i &apos;ve never abused my office
for sexual favors .
give us time to heal and rebuild their trust ... trust ...
mom , breakfast .
oh , hey , congratulations .
that &apos;s great . your husband &apos;s appeal . it looks like
it looks like he could get out of prison any month now , huh ?
looks like it .
early show had a story on it .
some good stuff on you , too .
did you catch it ?
no , missed it .
yeah , i caught it online .
i can send you the link .
that &apos;s okay .
no , no , no , it &apos;s easy .
so litigation wants me on this new class action .
that &apos;s where i &apos;m headed .
what about you ?
oh , i don &apos;t know .
oh , in here , i guess .
when did you say this was ?
may 15 , four months ago .
do you have anything with the date ?
a parking receipt .
had you ever met mr. mckeon before ?
no .
i &apos;d seen his family on the news .
i heard about their hotels and stuff , but that &apos;s about it .
well , the problem here , christy ,
is that any civil suit could be seen as ...
... opportunistic .
because of their money ?
yes .
i &apos;m sorry ,
but i didn &apos;t choose my rapist .
this kid doesn &apos;t know what she &apos;s in for .
taking on the mckeon family ...
alicia , if you don &apos;t mind ,
we just need to ... - no , it &apos;s all right , stay .
i don &apos;t know about this .
it &apos;s a criminal case , not a civil one .
except the new state &apos;s attorney rejected the charges .
yeah , because it &apos;s got duke lacrosse written all over it .
oh , come on .
what come on ?
put your politics aside , diane .
you &apos;re glenn childs ,
you get this dropped in your lap
a stripper at a bachelor party
accusing the son of the most powerful family in chicago of rape ...
and you don &apos;t think it &apos;s duke lacrosse ⅱ ?
he &apos;s worried about the mckeon family money .
he &apos;s worried about their campaign contributions .
well , i &apos;m worried that we &apos;re overextended .
how many sheffrin @-@ marks deposite do we have left ?
2 / 10 .
2 / 10 .
we need to keep our eye on the ball .
and christy is just gonna look like she &apos;s trying
to make some quick cash from the mckeon family .
do you believe her ?
i believe a lot of things i can &apos;t prove .
all right , here &apos;s what i think .
i know the mckeon family lawyer .
ericcson ?
right ,
william ericcson .
that &apos;s just what we need-- two wills .
the mckeons are gonna want to keep this out of the press ,
even if he didn &apos;t do it .
so my guess is they throw her some cash ,
maybe 50 grand or so to keep her quiet .
mr. ericcson , please .
tell him it &apos;s the other will .
i want you to be at this lunch .
don &apos;t say anything .
just listen and look serious .
i can do that .
how you holding up here ?
i &apos;m holding up .
oh , yeah , how do you know her ?
who ?
christy .
i don &apos;t .
then why did she ask for you to be on the case ?
i don &apos;t know .
ericcson here .
will .
will .
i think you know why i &apos;m calling .

two months ago , peter florrick was sentenced
to ten years for bribery and corruption .
today was the first step toward his release .
he was known in chicago simply as &quot; the hammer . &quot;
he jailed cop @-@ killers , ceos , corrupt politicians ,
until &quot; the hammer &quot; got hammered .
an hour ago , i resigned as state &apos;s attorney of cook county .
within weeks , chicago &apos;s incorruptible state &apos;s attorney
found himself with all the trappings
of a modern american scandal :
a rival with an eye on his job , an embarrassed wife ,
a blushing call girl and an r @-@ rated sex tape .
does she do this for you ?
does she ?
oh , god , please . you are ama ...
hey , ever heard the whole thing ?
no .
you &apos;re the only one who hasn &apos;t .
everything i have on mckeon .
what ? !
i beat you three sets to two .
oh , come on , you don &apos;t even believe that .
this is driving me crazy .
how do i know you ?
me ?
miner , parsons &amp; layton ?
alicia is actually our newest junior associate .
one month in .
will ericcson , alicia florrick .
well , it is very nice to meet you ,
mrs.florrick.
you , too .
i &apos;m rooting for your husband .
i know he has a lot of enemies in this town ,
but i always root for the underdog .
oh , just ignore him .
the only reason someone &apos;s forced out of public office
in america these days is sex .
so let &apos;s talk about lloyd mckeon .
it &apos;s so sad , really .
i remember when you had a respectable firm , will .
one that wouldn &apos;t sink to scurrilous charges like these .
and what charges might those be , will ?
i haven &apos;t said anything yet .
do you think you &apos;re the first firm she &apos;s shopping this lawsuit to ?
there &apos;s nothing there .
even the state &apos;s attorney ... the new state &apos;s attorney ...
thinks there &apos;s nothing there .
and yet
i got you to a settlement lunch on a half hour &apos;s notice .
mrs. florrick , what would you say
to someone bringing unsubstantiated sexual charges
against a public figure just in order to gain an advantage ?
you want to know what i would say ?
i would .
i would say you &apos;re trying to change the subject from rape .
well , i would agree that , as offensive and misguided
as these charges are , the optics
aren &apos;t exactly in our favor .
so we &apos;re willing to make an offer .
it &apos;s nonnegotiable .
you have till end of business day .
mckeon did it .
under a hundred thou , i would &apos;ve said no .
over a hundred thou ...
what about well over ?
if you don &apos;t mind my asking , ms. barbosa ,
why did you request me ?
i saw you on tv .
i thought you &apos;d understand
what it &apos;s like to be misunderstood .
ladies .
sorry about that .
mckeon &apos;s lawyers made a financial offer
that diane and i actually agree on .
a first .
it &apos;s a cash settlement .
$ 450,000 .
you &apos;re kidding .
we don &apos;t have to go to court ?
he just offered that ?
you &apos;ll have to sign a standard confidentiality agreement .
both parties free each other of liability
and agree not to speak to anyone , including the press .
what ?
it &apos;s standard in civil agreements .
i want everybody to know he settled .
can &apos;t we tell the police ?
not if we sign a confidentiality agreement .
mckeon could withdraw the award
and sue you for defamation .
what do you think ?
i think under the cir ...
i think you &apos;re looking for justice , christy .
and sometimes justice comes in a form we don &apos;t expect .
if you take this money , the settlement will be known
to the two people that matter most , you and him .
i &apos;m sorry , no .
he &apos;ll know how much it costs to
rape somebody and get away with it , that &apos;s all ?
this is about him admitting that he did this to me .
she &apos;s right .
okay , ericcson ,
how flexible are you on confidentiality ?
exclude new criminal discovery .
oh , come on , this isn &apos;t ...
you want to go to court , is that it ?
take it as far as pretrial ?
he doesn &apos;t want to go to trial .
look , ericcson ,
you want to make mckeon
the bachelor party rapist ,
be my ...
that &apos;s how you want to play it ?
we just turned down a half million bucks .
feels good , doesn &apos;t it ?
looks like we got a case .
you have to size these things up pretty quickly .
12 clients , stockbroker types , no one out of control .
it was easy .
they paid $ 400 for a 90 @-@ minute ,
two @-@ girl fantasy strip .
two girl ?
who was the other girl ?
maura ...
i @-@ i don &apos;t remember her last name .
that was the only time she worked
quien son estas mujeres ?
mama , deja me en pass , por favor .
sorry .
she insists on being here during all this .
it &apos;s a nightmare .
and mckeon ,
how &apos;d you meet him ?
the groom ?
he offered me another $ 100
for a private lap dance .
when i got in the bedroom , he locked the door .
then he grabbed me .
i tried to get the mace from my bag , tried to shout .
did you tell anyone afterwards ?
maura .
and our driver grant
he was the one who suggested she drive me
to the hospital for the rape exam .
and the service ,
worldwide elite ,
how long did you work for them ?
two years .
and what else did you do there ?
what do you mean ?
i mean , what else did you do there ?
for a year , i was an escort .
didn &apos;t you think that might be important to tell us ?
i haven &apos;t gotten a call in a year .
i was in an abusive relationship .
i needed the money to move out .
when i moved , i stopped working .
but still stripped .
so what &apos;s your point ...
a call girl can &apos;t get raped ?
yeah , that &apos;s my point , thanks .
look , she lied to us . why believe her now ?
&apos;cause she walked away from half a million dollars .
and when did she ever lie to us ?
you know , the more you bond with these clients ,
the less helpful you are .
your stripper was hooking .
why is she my stripper when she does something bad ?
okay , so the point is to prepare for trial
so we don &apos;t actually have to go to trial .
cary , right ?
yes , sir .
nice suit . i got a job for you .
i need you to take alicia &apos;s sheffrin @-@ marks depos for the week .
all right , i &apos;m on it .
this is settlement poker .
no one wants to go to trial ,
but the person who plays the better hand
makes the better deal .
so get me some good cards .
so your first thought is
to come to the state attorney &apos;s office ?
i just need one thing .
and why do i help you with that ?
because you like me .
that still works with people ?
mm @-@ hmm , like a charm .
you never should have quit this place .
i didn &apos;t quit . i was fired .
come on .
you ran a solid rape investigation .
you should be dying to slip us
the witness interviews .
leah ,
could you come outside for a second ?
and you &apos;re telling me your husband
had nothing to do with this ?
mr. childs , my law firm is bringing on
a civil action , that &apos;s all .
designed to embarrass my office
and make it look like i don &apos;t care about a rape victim .
a happy coincidence ?
i understand the need to blame someone
for your husband &apos;s downfall ,
but i didn &apos;t release that sex tape
to hurt you or your family .
i have kids , too .
and you should know i was holding back .
i had more to release about your husband ,
a lot more .
disturbing things ,
but out of compassion , i held back .
mr. childs , if you have something to show me ,
just do it , okay ?
&apos;cause the one thing i don &apos;t have time for
these days is empty threats .
you want something on your stripper ? get a subpoena .
i liked christy .
she was one of my best dancers .
but i have nothing else to add .
i &apos;m sorry .
we just need contact information .
that &apos;s all , ms . avarski ,
for the driver and the stripper .
dancer .
look , i would love ...
because we &apos;d really hate
to subpoena your books and client records .
you &apos;re east indian ?
yeah .
hmm , it &apos;s very popular these days .
contact information .
follow me .
why a @-@ b @-@ c ?
$ 1,500 an hour ,
$ 2,100 and , uh ,
$ 3,100 .
what makes someone more expensive ?
is this about the rape ?
no .
regular clients
and special requests .
requests ?
no condoms
or being dominated or role @-@ playing .
whatever they can &apos;t get at home .
people would really pay $ 3,000 an hour ?
the day rate is
$ 31,000 , dawn to dawn .
so about this rape , can you get me contact information
on this dancer ?
maura ? she quit right afterwards .
left a fake number ,
fake address , fake social .
happens all the time .
what about the driver ? could you help me find him ?
so , mom , where are you , anyway ?
look , i have to work late tonight .
can you ask grandma if she can stay till 10 : 00 ?
sure .
grandma , can you stay till 10 : 00 ?
mom &apos;s working late .
no need to shout , dear .
if she has to , she has to .
grandma can stay .
so , mom , i was talking to grandma ,
and she said she visited dad this weekend ,
and he was saying how much he missed us .
grandma said that ?
i was thinking maybe we should be going there .
you know , visiting him ?
your dad didn &apos;t want you to see him like that in prison .
he was ...
he didn &apos;t want you to worry .
but let me ask him , maybe he &apos;s changed his mind , okay ?
right .
we &apos;ll talk about it when i get home tonight , okay ?
all right , see you tonight .
i trust you &apos;re doing your homework .
five minutes .
we understand you can corroborate christy &apos;s story .
which was ?
that she told you about the rape right after it happened .
look , i like christy , she &apos;s a good tipper ,
but when she drinks , she doesn &apos;t know what the hell
she &apos;s talking about .
but you do .
christy gave the guy a lap dance ,
he paid her , we went home .
nobody said anything about any rape .
i don &apos;t blame christy for trying
to get extra money out of mckeon ,
but , hey , she &apos;s lying .
is that dad ?
i don &apos;t know .
but you &apos;re thinking it , too .
gonna need your help in a minute .
dad told us he made mistakes .
yeah , but not that .
do we tell mom ?
they sent them to mom
to hurt her .
so i say no .
so ?
i don &apos;t know .
do they want to see me ?
oh , zach does , but grace doesn &apos;t ?
she &apos;s hurt .
she thought you were everything .
so two months in , you seem well .
i am . some good guys here .
there &apos;s probably less backstabbing
than the state attorney &apos;s office .
you look good .
it &apos;s like it agrees with you .
so , here &apos;s the thing about childs .
everything he does is a political calculation .
everything he says ...
peter , no .
i don &apos;t want to be used .
alicia , i know you don &apos;t believe me ,
but childs set me up .
and if what i give you can help a rape victim ,
what &apos;s wrong with that ?
how do you know she &apos;s a rape victim , peter ?
i didn &apos;t tell your mom .
daniel told me .
your appellate lawyer ?
he &apos;s the one who referred christy to you .
what &apos;s wrong ?
i &apos;m hard @-@ pressed to think what &apos;s not wrong .
so he what ... ?
i mentioned to daniel
that you were with stern , lockhart ,
and that if he didn &apos;t have time for christy &apos;s case
that maybe you would .
i thought you &apos;d want the work .
you thought it was a good idea
to send me a hooker to represent ?
no , i thought it was a good idea to send you a rape victim .
oh , my god .
you had sex with her .
what ?
you &apos;re using her first name , peter .
you &apos;re saying &quot; christy . &quot;
she &apos;s one of your whores .
oh , alicia , would you stop it ?
when are you gonna stop thinking
that i slept with everyone ?
when are you gonna forgive me , for christ sakes ?
how much did you spend on amber ?
you had sex with her , what ,
ten times , 20 times ?
you don &apos;t want to know the details of what i did .
if you want me to forgive you ,
i need to know what i &apos;m forgiving you for .
so at $ 3,000 a pop , that &apos;s , what , $ 60,000 ?
did you pay her not to use a condom ?
was that extra ?
your trip to houston , did you take her with you ?
you know i didn &apos;t .
i don &apos;t know what i know .
grace &apos;s 12th birthday party , you s ...
you said you had to leave early .
where did you go , peter ?
you answer those questions , and then we will talk about forgiveness .
this is a pretrial hearing ,
so don &apos;t worry about the driver yet .
we just need to win a few motions .
sorry !
don &apos;t worry about it .
it all comes down to the rape kit .
still no luck finding the other stripper .
all we have is a first name , &quot; maura , &quot;
and a general description .
we need to box mckeon in .
there &apos;s only one of two ways
his semen ends up in the raped kid .
consensual sex or rape .
we get him to swear there was no consensual sex .
why would he do that ?
&apos;cause he has a wife .
there you are .
how you doing ?
you nervous ?
no , but maybe i should be .
this is just a pretrial hearing .
state &apos;s attorney &apos;s trying to squash our subpoena ,
so today we just get the ground rules straight ,
in case this thing goes to trial .
kalinda , i need you to get upstairs , get in
the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s office and wait for the subpoena .
i &apos;ll do that .
what ? you don &apos;t have to .
i know . i &apos;ll be back .
you all right ?
yeah , sure , i &apos;m fine .
oh , my god , this is too good .
we got judge abernathy .
he &apos;s our newest judge . he &apos;s so liberal ,
he makes michael moore look like rush limbaugh .
justice may be blind , but judges sure aren &apos;t .
god , ericcson must be pulling his hair out .
all rise for judge abernathy .
oh , please , don &apos;t stand .
everybody sit back down , please .
we &apos;ve got the big room here , don &apos;t we ?
your honor , given the stature of
my client , mr. mckeon ,
and given the fact that this pretrial
hearing has already garnered the attention
of our friends in the press ,
we would ask the court to seal the pretrial filings
and avoid a show trial .
oh , mr. ericcson , i don &apos;t think we need to do all that .
do we ? first amendment issues and all ?
i deny the petition with regret .
mr. gardner ?
yes , your honor .
we have a lot of testimony
focusing on whether there was a consensual act
between mr. mckeon and my client ,
but if mr. mckeon is willing to stipulate
there was , indeed , a consensual sexual act ,
we would forego this testimony .
that &apos;s a good point . mr. ericcson , how do you respond ?
we will stipulate there was no sex of any kind ,
forced or consensual , your honor .
the plaintiff also requests an expedited trial date ,
your honor , a dna sample from mr. mckeon ,
dna results from the rape kit , and the investigative reports
from the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s office .
they have been ... reluctant to furnish them .
thank you , counselor . i will grant all four motions .
mr. , uh ... ericcson ?
ah . i interpret from mr. ericcson &apos;s , uh , gesture
that he acquiesces .
well , i &apos;ll see you all back here ...
let &apos;s see . my docket is clear .
five days ?
how &apos;s that for expedited ?
uh , as a side note , i would like to ask for a moment of silence
for the recent mass killings in darfur .
okay , thank you .
court adjourned .
that was a great start , huh ?
i understand you &apos;re having trouble with the driver .
and you &apos;re boxed in on the rape kit .
you should just settle on our terms .
yeah , right . see you in trial .
may 15 , four months ago .
this one seemed cool .
hey . so you know will ?
12 clients , stockbroker types .
mr. gardner. you two went to school together ?
that &apos;s what they were saying the other night at drinks .
yeah .
so that &apos;s why ?
cary , if you don &apos;t mind ,
i &apos;ve had only a week with this .
you got an expedited trial date
to force the other side to settle ,
and now you guys are the ones suffering .
what are you looking for ?
&quot; tzk industries . &quot;
i ... i &apos;ve seen it somewhere before .
what is tzk industries ?
&quot; tzk industries . &quot;
it &apos;s a furniture supply company .
&quot; supplying elegant furniture to home and business . &quot;
why ? what do you need ?
something to undercut christy &apos;s driver .
it can &apos;t be that easy , can it ?
what ?
so i find this odd , mr. grant .
you were there , and you say there was no rape ?
so either you &apos;re lying
or my client &apos;s lying .
all i know is what i saw .
your honor , request permission to approach the witness .
yes . please . approach .
mr. grant , this is a copy of your wife &apos;s w @-@ 2 .
could you read the name of your wife &apos;s employer , please ?
&quot; tzk industries . &quot;
and tzk industries is a company owned
by the mckeon family to supply furniture to their properties
objection . not in evidence .
well , i think it &apos;s all right for it to be asked ,
mr. ericcson .
i ... actually , sustained .
your honor , you sustained the objection ?
i did . mr. ericcson had a point .
isn &apos;t it an amazing coincidence , mr. grant ,
that after a year of unemployment ,
your wife got a job in june from the mckeon family ,
a month after the bachelor party incident ?
no .
and why is that , mr. grant ?
because my wife and i are divorced .
my wife and i have been separated for a year now ,
so her getting this job has nothing to do with me .
but , sir , wouldn &apos;t you benefit
even if only in the form of lowered spousal support ?
i guess , but i &apos;m not warren buffett .
no further questions , your honor .
i &apos;m sorry . i didn &apos;t see it .
don &apos;t ever let your first chair get undercut like that again .
good news ?
i just got the rape kit results .
state &apos;s attorney wasn &apos;t stonewalling .
they sent it out to a commercial lab and just got it back .
and ?
it &apos;s not mckeon &apos;s dna .
the rape kit came back . it &apos;s not his sperm .
it &apos;s not mckeon &apos;s dna .
grant says you &apos;re lying . mckeon says you &apos;re lying .
i &apos;m not lying . i ...
it &apos;s really not his sperm ?
christy , we need to get the full ...
who else did you have sex with that night ?
no one . i swear .
well , you obviously had sex with someone
because it isn &apos;t his sperm .
so , was it a boyfriend or another client ?
you need to find maura .
we can &apos;t find maura .
you really don &apos;t remember anything
that could help us find her ?
we didn &apos;t talk .
she was on her cell phone
the whole night till her battery ran out .
i &apos;m sorry .
i need to get to class .
not that i mind it , but since when did you become me ?
you didn &apos;t believe her . i did .
maybe she is telling the truth .
christy said the light was flicked out ,
so maybe mckeon was with a friend .
so let &apos;s see if the cops tested the other party @-@ goers .
worth a try .
it &apos;s not just that .
what &apos;s up with your bud , abernathy ?
he &apos;s going out of his way to kill us .
you know how this works . liberal judge gets on the bench ,
doesn &apos;t want to rule from his bias ,
so he bends over backwards the other way .
i thought you said you had some pull with him .
he wanted to be on your glass ceiling committee or whatever it is .
&quot; emily &apos;s list . &quot;
are you suggesting i influence a sitting judge
in some untoward fashion ?
no , just in a toward one .
come on , come to the court ,
let him see your sad little liberal face ...
and contemplate a life without his friends .
will , i &apos;m so sorry .
don &apos;t be . we &apos;re a team .
no apologies .
now what are you doing ?
close the door .
come on , zach . just let it go .
would you shut up and look at this ?
see that ?
it &apos;s called a &quot; specular highlight . &quot;
it &apos;s like a light in the eye reflected in the eye .
see where it is ?
it &apos;s to the left .
and now , look at this .
the lady &apos;s eye . see ?
the dot &apos;s to the right .
okay ...
they &apos;re not in the same picture .
dad &apos;s face was photoshopped into it .
hello ? zach , grace , i &apos;m home .
jackie , i have a request to make .
certainly , dear .
you want the kids to visit peter in prison , you talk to me .
you don &apos;t talk to zach .
when did i talk to zach ?
you told him peter was lonely in prison .
because he is .
just don &apos;t go around me by talking to my kids .
how was work ?
it was crappy .
i thought i &apos;d make breakfast .
for dinner ?
my goodness .
like when you were little .
you don &apos;t have to like it . it &apos;s for me .
so , i want to show you some pictures
of where dad &apos;s staying .
what ?
i want to make sure you know what &apos;s involved
with visiting dad in prison , okay ?
i &apos;ll get that .
so , zach , can you show me how
to get to &quot; google images &quot; on your computer ?
yeah , sure .
what is that ?
nothing . homework .
mom !
someone &apos;s here !
hi . still no maura ?
dna is definitely not from mckeon &apos;s semen .
i was going to the crime lab to see if they ever collected dna
from the other party @-@ goers when ...
you can watch a little tv .
i &apos;ll be right in .
want to do this later ?
no , no , no .
i think i just caught my son checking out porn .
anyway ...
i asked a cop friend
to run the rape kit results through codis .
and they got a hit .
who , the best man ?
manny lyons .
a rapist serving 20 to life in an ohio supermax .
i don &apos;t understand .
you &apos;re in good company .
and he &apos;s a convicted rapist .
christy was raped .
apparently .
i don &apos;t get it .
was he ...
was he at the party ?
well , as far as i can tell , he was in a holding cell
in columbus at the time .
this makes no sense .
we know .
this pile is everything on the manny lyons rape .
this pile , everything on ours .
and we can &apos;t find one thing in common .
no connection with mckeon ?
nope , we checked it .
&quot; manny lyons broke into an upper arlington apartment , &quot;
&quot; held a knife to the neck of a 40 @-@ year @-@ old divorcee , &quot;
&quot; raped her , and stole her car . &quot;
&quot; he was stopped running a traffic light ten miles away . &quot;
&quot; the divorcee identified him in a six @-@ pack photo line @-@ up . &quot;
what ?
they do have one thing in common .
and you were the lab supervisor who worked on analysis 5795--
the rape kit in this case-- professor ?
doctor .
doctor .
and these are your initials , &quot; gg , &quot;
right at the bottom of the report ?
yes , those are mine .
oh , uh , excuse me .
this isn &apos;t 5795. this is 5794 .
the manny lyons case . my mistake .
oh , i see that you ran the analysis on both cases .
given the sequential numbering ,
i imagine that you worked on one right after the other ?
it appears so .
in both cases , the dna matched the same culprit ,
manny lyons , is that correct ?
it is .
so let ...
let me follow the logic here .
manny lyons ...
who never set foot in chicago ...
objection. not in evidence .
i will sustain that .
isn &apos;t it true , dr. girtzman ,
the only connection between manny lyons and christy barbosa
is that you worked on both cases ?
objection . argumentative .
mrs. florrick , this is not a debating society .
sustained .
dr. girtzman ,
would you say
that the standard of a commercial lab is relaxed ?
no. and , uh , your honor ,
may i answer her earlier question ?
personal privilege .
oh , yeah , if you &apos;d like .
we handle an immense backlog of untested rape kits
from crime labs all across the country .
we do so with speed and professionalism ...
and yet isn &apos;t it true , sir ,
that your lab almost lost
its accreditation in 2005 ...
now , that was never proved ! ...
when you cross @-@ contaminated
two dna samples that were out @-@ sourced from a crime lab ...
this is an old slander !
... that you failed to sterilize scissors
that then carried the dna from one sample to the next ?
i don &apos;t have to answer this .
actually , you do , sir .
your honor , given this testimony ,
we move that the rape kit be reexamined
at a second genetic lab .
i think that is an understandable request , mr. ericcson .
your honor , we would stipulate
that mrs. florrick has proven her case .
dr. girtzman cross @-@ contaminated the sample ...
excuse me ?
but we would argue , therefore ,
that is the very reason it cannot be tested again .
you &apos;ve got to be kidding me .
the very fact that it is agreed that the sample is now contaminated
it means it can &apos;t possibly be tested with any authority .
your honor ...
mr. gardner , you argued that the rape kit was contaminated .
you can &apos;t now argue it &apos;s probative .
the plaintiff &apos;s motion for retesting is denied .
your honor ... !
motion is denied .
we &apos;ve got to find that other stripper .
so basically this is a hail mary pass ?
look at you with the sports metaphors .
yeah , i don &apos;t see many other options here .
good evening .
do you have a reservation ?
actually , we have a ... strange request .
we need to get a printout of a phone bill
from four months ago .
the name ?
mckeon .
first name ?
lloyd .
would you liked that e @-@ mailed or a hard copy ?
hard copy .
if i could just see some i.d , mr. mckeon .
um , well , actually can i ask you a question--
rosemary ?
there was a bachelor party here
in may that resulted in a ... a rape .
were you here then ?
i was .
well , the only person we believe who can corroborate
the rape victim &apos;s story was using a cell phone that night .
and we &apos;re thinking she used the bathroom phone
when her battery ran out .
we were hoping to glance at the bill
just to see if there was a number she dialed .
i &apos;ll have to speak to a manager .
nice thought .
if all else fails , try honesty .
i got 20 bucks on deception .
will ?
oh , hey .
what are you doing in north of the loop ?
you know , just seeing how the other half lives .
alicia ,
this is marlena .
nice to meet you .
hi .
ask for a view of the lake .
it &apos;s beautiful at night .
she thinks we &apos;re getting a room .
yep .
now they all think we &apos;re getting a room .
you worried ?
you ?
we could do worse .
i &apos;m having trouble getting my manager .
if you could just wait another minute .
i owe you $ 20 .
okay , christy and maura arrived at 10 : 15 .
right there , 11 : 20 .
out @-@ of @-@ state area code .
hello . you don &apos;t know me ...
were you the other dancer there that night , maura ?
i was , yes .
and your driver , mr. grant ,
what did he tell you
after you took christy to the hospital ?
he told us that the mckeons were very rich ,
and we should all keep our mouths shut .
and that &apos;s why you went back home to michigan ?
yes .
i &apos;m sorry . i was scared .
and to reiterate ,
christy told you about the rape immediately afterward ?
yes . in fact , he followed her out into the parking lot
and he said , &quot; don &apos;t tell anyone . &quot;
&quot; just take the money and shut up . &quot;
no further questions , your honor .
thank you , alicia .
for ... you know .
christy , i &apos;m just curious .
where did you meet my husband ?
your husband ?
i &apos;ve never met your husband .
my mistake .
all rise for judge abernathy .
good afternoon .
i have given this case quite a bit of thought ,
as you can imagine .
you have both argued your case well .
but i find myself judging in favor of the defendant .
without a dna match to the rape kit ,
we have a classic he @-@ said , she @-@ said ,
and as much as my personal sympathies lie with the plaintiff ,
the evidence does not warrant a favorable decision .
judgment in favor of the defense .
are you okay ?
no .
i &apos;m sorry .
i believe you .
this is all i want to say .
i have been falsely accused by a woman
who wanted nothing more than a quick payday .
but every year there are thousands of women
who are abused ,
and i don &apos;t think we should let this false accusation ...
mr. mckeon .
you &apos;re under arrest for the rape of christy barbosa .
wha ... ?
cuff him .
what ?
is this a joke ?
it must be hard to lose , mrs. florrick .
not if it forces you to prosecute .
i &apos;m coming out of this with a criminal case i &apos;ll win ,
and you &apos;re coming out with a loss .
nice job .
lloyd mckeon was arrested today for rape ,
literally seconds after he was cleared in a civil case
for the identical crime .
state &apos;s attorney glenn childs took credit for finding
an untainted sample of dna
that will guarantee mckeon &apos;s conviction in a criminal trial .
childs denied that mckeon &apos;s arrest was a reaction to ...
this is yours ?
yeah .
is he going to jail ?
i think so .
well , then that &apos;s good .
thanks .
good night .
good night .
what do you want me to do ?
i want you to beg .
please ...
oh ... does she do this for you ?
does she ?
oh , god , please ...
you &apos;re amazing ...
what do you want me to do ?
what do you want me to do to you ?
just ... don &apos;t ... stop .
what &apos;ll you give me ?
what &apos;ll you give me not to stop ?
everything .
