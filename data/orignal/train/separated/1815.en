The first 24h after surgery are critical.
Every breath you take, every fluid you make
is meticulously recorded and analyzed...
Celebrated... or mourned.
But what about the next 24 hours?
So you and Cristina are going fishing?
Whose idea was that?
Owen's concerned about leaving Cristina alone,
So when I told him I was going fishing...
Right, but you haven't actually spoken to Cristina?
Actually, I have.
You spoke to her? When?
I called her last night. Well,
Well, she must have been drunk or something,
because she doesn't do the wilderness.
I mean, there aren't even any bathrooms in the wilderness.
Look, I know you're concerned about her,
but I also know that there's nothing else we can do right now.
But you can?
Because if fishing is your big plan to get her back to work
We're not trying to get her back to work.
We just want to make sure she's okay.
Well, she's not okay,
and she's not going to be okay until she gets back to work.
I know Cristina. She needs to work.
Meredith...
Well, I mean, she's not gonna show today.
I mean, she may have agreed to it last night,
but in the cold, hard light of day,
there's no way--
What happens when that first day turns to two...
and weeks turn into months?
Hey, you wanna do it real quick?
Nothing says good morning like shower sex.
Look, I hope you don't take this the wrong way,
because the sex with you has been... great,
but... it just...
it just makes me miss Arizona.
The sex with you just makes me sad.
Oh, no. That came out wrong. Sorry.
No, I get it.
Yeah?
Last night when we were doing it,
I was thinking about Lexie. I was thinking--
I'm gonna need some more consonants?
When we were having sex, you were thinking about Lexie?
Okay, now that's just rude.
Well, you just
said having sex with me makes you sad.
'Cause I'm amazing.
I know.
That's why I suggested the wake-up call.
Just get out.
Seriously. Get out.
Now I'm missing Lexie even more.
What was that?
Nothing.
I am amazing!
Uh, let me give you a hand with that.
Thanks.
Hey. Bye.
Thank you.
What happens when the immediate danger has passed...
when the machines are disconnected...
and the teams of doctors and nurses are gone?
Well, I-I should go.
Cristina.
There are no bathrooms... out there, you know?
I know.
Surgery is when you get saved.
But post-op...
After surgery...
is when you heal.
But what if you don't?
You're removing a gallbladder from someone's mouth.
I mean, no incision, no scar. It's like you were never there.
I-- sorry. I'll stop talking.
You want to do one of these?
Is that a trick question?
The-- the trick is, how bad do you want it?
Um, wh-when I was little, I wanted a pony--
Like, really, really wanted a pony.
This feels a little bit like that.
Good, 'cause I'm having a contest.
Grabbing the gallbladder.
Now each of you is researching a different
protocol aimed at trying to eliminate fistulas,
but it's taking too long.
So this is the incentive.
The person whose protocol leads to the fewest number
of post-operative complication
gets to pull a gallbladder out of a mouth.
There she is.
Beautiful.
All righty.
May I be excused?
I am checking on my patients every two hours, and it's time.
Go ahead.
Uh, may I-- may I be excused, please?
Uh... me, too?
Go.
You're a mad genius.
If I was a genius,
I'd have rid the world of fistulas by now.
Good morning.
Morning.
How's Cristina?
She's fine.
She's fishing.
She's fishing?
Why?
Ask him.
Have you got any better ideas?
No.
No. See ya.
How do I look?
I'm about to propose to my girlfriend.
So besides the gown, and the I.V.,
and the ghostly pallor from being in the hospital for the past week,
What do you think, do I have a shot?
She'd be a fool to say no.
Good luck.
Hey, can either of you use me today?
I'm supposed to be with Stark,
But he wants to work with someone else.
Ouch.
The guy's an ass.
Maybe heartlessness is a peds thing.
No offense, but your girlfriend leaving town really screwed me.
I mean, I'm happy for the children of Malawi and
Yeah, no, you should be worried for them.
Right now she's making them fall in love with her.
"Oh, I'll uncleft your palate,
I'll unherniate your hernia, I'm here for you. I'm yours."
Yeah, and then someplace better will come along...
Mm-hmm. Peru or India-- and suddenly she's all...
"I know I was helping you
and I made you all kinds of promises, but-- "
"But I gotta go."
"yeah, have fun with Stark."
I miss you.
Mark.
What, you're saying you don't miss me?
Pretty much what I'm saying.
You seeing someone?
Yes. His name's Andrew Rabb.
He had a tumor removed from his pancreas three days ago,
and I'm trying to make sure he doesn't develop a fistula.
Go. Cure fistulas. Or fistulae.
Fistulas.
I miss you.
Okay, two minutes out.
So, uh... you ever go fishing with Derek?
I'm a surgical resident.
When would I have time for that?
You get a day off now and then.
I spend my days off here, where she should be.
Meredith...
What are your plans for her for tomorrow,
bowling with Bailey, cooking class?
I'm not sure, but, uh...
bowling with Bailey -- that sounds fun.
Trina Paiz, 27, stable.
Only complaint is a lacerated ear.
Pretty amazing considering she fell 100 feet into a ravine.
Apparently her husband broke her fall.
Jason Paiz, 27
Jason!
Grey, take her to Trauma Two.
Is he okay?
BP 70 palp in the field.
Please.
He has to be okay.
He has to be okay.
Started two large-bore IVS...
Okay, Trina, do you know where you are?
A hospital i-in Seattle.
I...I don't know the name. I'm not from here.
I'm here on my honeymoon.
My God, my husband...
Dr. Hunt is excellent, so he's in good hands.
Do you remember what happened?
We were hiking up this mountain,
and we wanted a picture,
so we handed our camera to some guy.
And...we posed...we kissed.
No, we were kissing, and then...
the next thing I know, I'm looking up at the sky,
and then we're on the ground or...
Jason's on the ground, and I'm on top of him,
and...
Please tell me he's not gonna die.
He can't die.
Wife is stable. Nervous, but --
She should be. His abdomen is distended,
and he has a lot of internal bleeding.
Systolic's 60, Dr. Hunt.
Pressure's dropping.
Let's get him to an O.R. Now.
Watch that line.
Quickly.
All right. Let's move.
Grey, no time to scrub. Come on.
Gown me.
On three. One, two, three.
See if his type and cross is back yet.
In the meantime, get me some FFP
and some factor VII up here.
Drape him.
Good. Okay.
Let's go. 10-blade.
10-blade.
I hope no one is wearing new shoes.
More laps.
Laps! laps!
Grey, I can't see anything.
I'm suctioning.
Suction's too slow. Use your hands. Another suction.
How's his pressure?
79 over 40.
He's like a bucket full of holes.
I'm gonna occlude the aorta at the hiatus
till we can get his pressure back up.
How many units has he gotten?
Three units of O-neg,
one unit A-positive type specific,
and one unit of FFP.
Okay. Let's get some more packs in there.
Let's try and isolate this bleeder
until we figure out what we're dealing with.
Laps. More. Keep 'em coming. More.
More. Quickly. Faster. I don't want to have to keep asking.
Can I make a suggestion?
If you mount the rod holders mid-ship,
we can both reach the rods from either end of the boat.
After you called last night, I did some research.
I didn't want to be anything less than seaworthy.
Well, it's a lake.
Still.
Uh, actually, it's, uh...
it's a great idea.
You may need clip-on mounts to clear the gunwales.
Are you gonna be like this all day?
I can't help it.
I've tried to avoid getting a new hip
because I just didn't want to deal with the recovery, but --
There's no cartilage left, bone spurs.
Our daughter's an orthodontist in Sarasota.
Sheila.
What? They should know that we have
medical people in the family.
We're not just nobodies off the street.
Mr. Cherkovsky, clearly you need a new hip.
Now I've had a lot of success with a new,
minimally invasive technique. Dr. Karev.
Well, she'd use computer guidance
to avoid any excess radiation.
And she'd make a small incision along the muscle...
so we would avoid damaging the hip muscle.
Now I can fit you in this afternoon at 2:00 p.m.
and have you walking out of here by the end of the week.
Why does she have an opening? Why isn't she busier?
What my wife wants to know -- - I- I heard her.
I'm -- I'm standing right here.
Um, actually, I'm just coming off of some leave,
and so my schedule's flexible.
But, uh, I'm the only surgeon in the northwest
doing minimally invasive hip replacements.
Ask her why no else is doing it if it's so great.
Because they can't, and she can.
Tell them you want a second opinion. - Sheila --
No, no, no. You know what? Actually, your wife's right.
It's always a good idea to get another opinion.
Call Dan Miller
and see if he can squeeze them in right now.
Maybe I should mention
that their daughter is an orthodontist.
Yeah, they're gonna meet with Miller,
hear about his 6-week recovery period,
and coming running back. Keep my 2:00 p.m. slot open.
We're gonna be replacing Ron's hip.
Hey, morning, Eli.
Um, did you send Mr. Rabb's sample
of pancreatic fluid to the lab yet?
Not yet.
Uh, I asked for it over an hour ago.
Yeah, I was letting him rest.
He didn't sleep much last night.
Dr. Grey, check out Mrs. Kay.
Day three post-op, no fistula.
Already walking right away, eating right away,
isn't that right, Mrs. Kay?
Can I go back to bed now? I'm tired.
One more lap.
Terrible.
Okay, there is no evidence that shows
getting patients up faster makes any difference at all.
How's it going with your protocol?
It looks like you -- okay-- added just another medicine
to your drug regimen there, huh?
Yeah, I mean,
well, if you call octreotide "just another medicine."
So you're still, uh, sticking with the little list?
Yeah. Standard post-op protocol
with a checklist I've developed for accountability.
Oh, my gosh. So you know what?
When I was little, I- I wanted a pony, too.
And do you know what happened?
I, uh, I worked really hard and I got one.
Mr. Rabb probably can't sleep at night
because you're letting him sleep during the day.
Get the fluid sample now.
Hey. How'd it go?
Hey. Uh, not so well.
Oh. I'm sorry.
Nah, I don't blame her.
I was proposing for all the wrong reasons.
I mean, I liked her and all,
but what I liked most about her was her P.P.O.
You don't have insurance?
Capped out about three operations ago.
I've been charging it on my credit cards.
Do you mind if I look at your chart?
No, go ahead.
Thanks.
I'm warning you, though, it's pretty scary stuff.
Just saying.
You have Von Hippel-Lindau Disease.
And you have been hospitalized for over 200 days in the last three years?
Lot of good memories.
Dr. Webber's your surgeon?
Not for long. They're discharging me today.
You have a pretty dangerous tumor on your adrenal gland.
They're not gonna just throw you out on the street.
You know what? Let me see what I can do.
Look, I don't know how much your fee is, uh, but--
but I know I can't afford it.
I heard you just got married.
How'd you meet your husband?
Uh, we worked together.
There was a no-dating policy at our firm.
Oh, my God.
You're doing great. Keep talking.
He kept asking me out,
and... he's just like that.
You tell him he can't do something,
it just makes him want to do it more.
Sounds like my kinda guy.
And then there was this work bowling party,
and... we were both waiting in line
to return our shoes.
And... he just kissed me.
And then I was like, "Okay, I need to find a new job,"
Because he was a really good kisser.
Is.
He is a really good kisser.
His B.P. is still 70.
With all these lap pads, it should be better by now.
His pelvis and his spleen look clean.
Has to be his liver. Try a pringle maneuver.
Let's see if we can stop this bleeding.- Okay.
Keep going. Okay.
Damn it. Damn it. That's what I was afraid of.
His vena cava is torn. You can let go.
Dr. Hunt, what are we doing?
This is-- this is a lethal injury.
He's on his honeymoon.
Pressure's still dropping. 60 over 40.
Dr. Hunt, what do we do?
Dr. Hunt?
Dr. Hunt, what's your plan?
You have to have a plan. We can't stand here
and do nothing while this guy bleeds out.
If you don't have a plan, then
Okay, 10-blade.
Here you go.
It's a long shot,
but if we crack his chest, put in a shunt,
and bypass the blood flow trying to get to the heart,
it'll give us time to make the repair.
You don't get to talk to me like that in my O.R.
If you can't keep your problems--
our problems-- outside, then you should go.
Bone saw.
What is this? Wait. Don't tell me?
Crankbait-- best used in muddy water.
Oh, I know.
Quiz me.
Is this a spinnerbait?
You know, the fish can hear you.
Did you read about that in your research?
Fishing is supposed to be quiet.
Is this a spinner bait?
I'm not quizzing you. I'm fishing.
You're no fun.
Maybe we should move the boat over to the other side of the lake.
No.
This is a good spot.
For tanning maybe.
Is this typical?
I mean, to go for hours without a bite?
Well, the only thing predictable about fishing
is that it's unpredictable.
Wow. That's deep.
Yeah. Why don't you ponder that for a while...
Quietly?
Okay, I pondered it, but the thing is,
I don't agree with the basic premise.
Okay, assuming a lake has fish in it, which this lake does,
and assuming that you're using the right
baits and lures, which we are,
you should be able to predict getting more bites than, um,
like none an hour.
You know--
Which leads me to believe that the fish are elsewhere,
like-- like over there, or over there, or over there.
Right, and if you were over there,
you would scare them away with your incessant chatter.
Fishing is supposed to be quiet.
And it's supposed to involve catching fish,
which we could do if we moved the boat
to where the fish are-- are-- are sleeping or-- or eating--
Just stop. Stop talking. Stop worrying.
Stop thinking. Stop.
Can we-- can we-- can we just--
can we just try it my way, please?
No.
I can't stop.
I can't turn my mind off.
Yes, you can.
But--
You can. Just fish.
Do it pro bono.
Look, Henry needs long-term medical care,
and the hospital just can't afford to take that on.
Oh, so we do nothing?
No, we treat him with drugs
and we schedule regular follow-ups at the clinic.
Well, you might as well do nothing.
Look, I wish I could treat him. I really do.
But my hands are tied.
That is a load of crap.
I have seen you bend the rules around here.
If I was Bailey or Shepherd,
I'm sure that your hands wouldn't be so tied.
Dr. Altman, that's enough.
I'm sorry.
Cristina Yang is fishing today.
She is one of the most talented surgical residents
I have ever seen,
and she is fishing instead of operating,
and that is partly my fault.
I just want to do something good today.
Make it up, pay it forward-- whatever you want to call it--
I... I just need to do some good.
I'll... set up a meeting with the Review Board.
Thank you.
Look, they met with Dr. Miller three hours ago.
Give it time.
They're not gonna call 'cause they're idiots.
Hey, where are you going?
I'm going up to Miller's office to tell'em what idiots they are.
No, they're gonna call.
All right, now you're just being stubborn.
Yes, I am being stubborn.
I am stubbornly choosing to believe
that sometimes people make sane decisions,
like having minimally invasive surgery when it's available.
I am stubbornly choosing to believe that
not all people are evil and bad
and leave me in airports.
Told ya.
Good. The shunt is in. Secure it inferiorly.
Umbilical tape.
Here you go, doctor.
Uh, now we're gonna fix the I.V.C.
I'm gonna lift the liver only enough for you
to gain access to the tear.
You're gonna let me sew?
Are you questioning my judgment or are you saying thank you?
No, I just... Thank you.
Good. So...
One stitch at a time.
Slow and steady. Ready?
Okay. 3-0 prolene, Boki.
Mm. Anybody want my soup?
It's reminding me of pancreatic fluid.
Oh, mm-hmm. Then I definitely want it.
Sparkle.
That was the name of my pony.
Dr. Kepner, your patient,
Mrs. Hathaway just came into the E.R.
She's in septic shock. C.T. showed a fistula.
Dr. Bailey wants you in O.R. 2 right away.
No. Mrs. Hathaway?
We just discharged her three days ago. She was fine! Hmm.
And then there were two.
Um, Eli, I need another sample of Mr. Rabb's fluid.
Uh, that's gonna be tough. I took the drain out.
You what?
Well, with the drain in,
he can't turn over, which means he has to sleep on his back,
which means he isn't sleeping, so--
Okay,
just call radiology.
We have to put it back in.
I need to be able to see the fluid
to tell if there's an infection.
Well, I can tell by looking at it that it's not infected.
Just call radiology.
Look, if Dr.Bailey
wants it put back in, then I will.
No, she's in surgery.
Well, then it'll have to wait.
Fine. Okay. You know, I'll-- I'll do it myself.
You're not touching that patient.
Excuse me?
You have your list, but I have 12 years of experience
that tells me that putting that drain back in right now
could actually put him at more risk for infection.
12 years, I've been here-- 12 years.
Now you residents, you come and go,
but this is my home, and you are my guest.
And right now, you are no longer welcome.
What's the emergency?
Oh, uh, I need a favor.
A nurse hates me.
You're a resident.
I'm sure all the nurses hate you.
Yes, well, they love you.
I think you love me.
Fine. Okay. Whatever.
Can you please just talk to him,
smooth things over, so that when I go to take
my patient back to radiology and get his drain put back in,
he doesn't make a scene?
Fine. I'll talk to him.
But you gotta meet me at Joe's tonight for a drink.
You are unbelievable.
That's why you love me, 'cause I'm unbelievable.
You and I, we don't work, okay?
We-we've been through this.
One drink.
Fine. One drink.
Oh, God. Okay, there he is.
Eli?
E--
Two drinks.
Fine.
Fine. Stay here.
Eli.
Yeah.
You got a second?
Oh, listen, I don't know what's going on here,
but I know better than to mess with you on your turf,
so do me a solid.
Nod, act as if we're having a big debate here,
'cause Dr. Grey over there,
she agreed to go out with me if I talk to you.
She's bossy.
I know. I dig it.
Mm. What's in it for me?
Seahawks, Sunday, box seats.
Parking?
Of course.
Mm-hmm. Okay.
Unless Dr. Bailey herself orders that drain put back in,
I--
Now mention how highly I think of her.
I don't care if you think
Dr. Grey is the best resident
you've ever seen come through this program.
Mm-hmm. I understand.
And I respect that. Thank you.
Yeah.
Well, I did what I could. What time do you get off?
What?! That's it. You didn't do anything.
See you tonight.
You're going out with Sloan tonight?
One drink, and then you are gonna interrupt us
and tell me that there's a medical emergency.
Well, there might be a medical emergency
if you don't get that drain back in your guy.
I'm just sayin', I guess you can observe
when I'm taking out that gallbladder
through a dude's mouth.
Dr. Hunt, I updated Mrs. Paiz and
and checked your calls.
Uh, Dr. Marshall from N.Y.U. called
about speaking at their conference,
and the lab called with results for your kidney patient.
That it? N- nothing from my wife?
No, that's it.
You ready?
Lifting the liver.
Dr. Miller can't fit Ron in for three weeks,
and we called our daughter in Sarasota,
and she said maybe we should wait,
But Ron wants it, and I-I just want what ron wants,
So, um, tell her, Ron,
tell her we want this 2:00 slot.
Oh, yeah, I wish I could,
but I'm-- I'm already booked.
No-- no, you're not.
Yeah, I am. Yeah. I have that, um...
fused knee thing.
Right, right, the guy with the knee.
Yeah. You know, let me see if I can, uh,
switch some things around.
I'd really appreciate it.
Oh, what if I push that down to later?
No, you're geting that award tonight.
You can't miss that.
Oh, that's right.
Shoot.
Okay, you know what?
I'll do Ron, and then I'll just be late for the dinner.
I am so sick of those awards dinners anyway.
It's like... Waka, waka, waka.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Thanks.
Eli.
Dr. Bailey, have I told you lately
how much I like your eyes?
D-- I am not in the mood. Why did you remove the drain?
Because it was ready to be removed.
Now I have to put the drain back in.
and write you up.
cause that-- you said you were gonna write-- write him up.
Let me handle this, Grey.
Okay, Mr. Rabb is not sleeping, doctor.
That's a problem bec
Okay, I feel for him,
but this protocol isn't just about him.
I don't do protocols. I treat patients.
Eli, save your high-and-mighty routine for someone else.
Now I'm sick of all of these post-op complications.
I hate post-op complications more than you do, Dr. Bailey.
I do. They're time consuming. They're messy.
They make it difficult for me to check up
on my fantasy football team as often as I'd like,
So I make sure that my patients don't get them.
I mean, you know you're happy when I'm working.
And it's not just because of my pretty face.
It's 'cause I'm good at what I do.
Well, think about it. When's the last time you had
a post-op complication with one of my patients? Hmm?
Good work.
I think I can get another stitch in.
We can't risk it. There's too much pull on the liver.
I'm lowering it.
I want to try.
No.
There's not as much blood in the field as before.
He can handle another stitch.
Remove your hand, Dr.Grey.
Just another second.
Don't--
Done. I got it. I-- lower the liver.
Get out of my O.R.
What? I did it. Look. See? He's fine.
I'm not gonna say it again.
No, I just got kicked out of the O.R.
Because I'm just so sick of all of this.
I'm sick of her not talking to me.
I'm sick of you two pretending to be friends.
So put her on the phone.
Well, thank you, Dr.Keller. I think you did the right thing,
coiling the aneurysm rather than clipping it.
Thank you for the update,
and I will check in with you later.
Was that Meredith?
No.
Yes.
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! I think I have a bite.
Oh, my God! What do I-- what do I do? What do I do?!
Oh, my God! What do I do?!
Stay calm. Stay calm. Sit down. Sit down.
Oh, my God! Oh, my God. Okay,
Okay. I'm sitting down.
All right, good.
I didn't read the part where you--
What-- what to do when you catch a fish.
Okay, let it run for a second.
What does that mean?!
What does that mean?!
Stay right there. Sit down.
Okay, okay. Let it-- let the fish run a little.
Let it-- let it--Okay, go. Go, go, go, go, go, go,
Give it some-- just give it some-- there it is.
Okay, okay. Now what?
Give it some line.
Let it go. Easy. Let it--
Yes. Let it tire itself out.
Okay. Easy. Now reel it in.
Reeling it in. Okay. Good, good. Good, good.
See, you're fishing.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! I'm fishing!
I'm fishing! Aah!
You're fishing. Whoa!
Okay.
You're good.
Yeah, well, tell that to Stark.
Stark? Please. You don't need Stark.
You know why?
In a year, everyone's gonna want this surgery...
Except there's only one of me.
Unless... I create another me.
That could be you--
The guy me.
Not as pretty, not as good, but close.
I could teach you if you want.
Screw Stark.
Stark's loss is my gain.
Okay, Ron, here comes your new hip.
Could I talk to you for a second?
Uh, guys, give us the room.
Yes, doctor.
I knew what I was doing.
I knew I could do that second stitch.
And you knew I could do that second stitch.
And if it were anyone else, you would've let them do it.
But because I question how you handle Cristina
You chose to slap me down
and let everybody know who's boss.
You want to know what I think?
I think you're reckless.
I think you're reckless with your own life,
and today, you were reckless with the patient's life.
And I don't care who you are, I don't want that in my O.R.,
and I do not want that around my wife,
who is struggling just to hold on.
Your wife is struggling just to hold on
because you married her
and let it be okay for her to completely fall apart.
What is Cristina gonna do when she gets back
from her fishing trip tonight,
Tomorrow, next week, next month, next year?
Because we'll all be here working,
and Cristina will be... where?
I don't know.
I don't know, but she has the right to figure that out.
You don't know. Well, I know,
because I know Cristina Yang.
And she needs to work,
because surgery is who we are.
You told a guy with a gun to shoot you.
That is who you are.
What the hell does that have to do wi--
You-- you are fearless, and I don't mean that in a good way.
Most people don't tell the guy with the gun to shoot them.
Most people are like Cristina. Most people are afraid.
So what she needs isn't what you need.
She isn't you...
Meredith.
Well, he's right.
His patient records for the past three months
show a post-op complication rate way lower than the norm.
Wait, 12% compared to 42%?
Wow.
Okay, can you two stop being impressed by him?
It's a fluke. He's mean.
Hand me those charts.
I think he's kinda hot.
Can you say that about a nurse?
No.
Oh. Day three.
Day...
Three.
Day three.
Yeah? What?
Day three?
Oh. Oh, oh, oh, okay, deep-- deep breaths.
Deep breaths.
Dr. Bailey?
Ooh, yes. Okay. Okay.
Okay, should we be following her?
A medicalert bracelet?
That's your solution?
If the patient has a hypertensive crisis--
When... When he has a hypertensive crisis...
The paramedics will bring Mr. Burton here,
and we'll treat his emergent condition.
Yeah. That will be too late, he will be dead.
So you're sending him home to die,
but you're okay with it because you're giving him
a bracelet with his name on it.
Um, if we remove the drain on day three instead of day five,
we can reduce the formation of fistulas by 30%.
See, uh, Eli took out a drain when he wasn't supposed to,
and I was gonna write him up because he can't do that,
But he did.
Uh, I'm going to leave the files for you to look at.
Oh. Uh-- oh, I'm sorry.
I'm... Miranda Bailey--
the doctor who cured fistula.
That's right. I said it.
Uh, Jonas Salk-- he cured polio.
Miranda Bailey is going to cure fistula.
Th-th-three. Day three.
28... pounds.
That's one of the biggest we've had this year.
Ah, look at that.
Wow. Nice fish.
Thanks.
You want a picture?
Oh, definitely. Definitely. Take a picture. Come on.
Let's take a picture.
All right. You pick it up,
I'll get the camera.
Oh, my god. How am I supposed to pick it up?
You just pick it up and take it off. You can.
It's very slippery, so be careful.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Hold it up like that. All right?
Ready? Great.
Yes, yes. Oh, God.
Oh, my God. It's totally heavy.
Okay, ready?
Your friend's first time out, huh?
Yeah, first time.
Yeah, she really is something.
Yes, she is. She really is.
Okay. Smile now.
Well, that's okay. We don't need a picture.
Take it.
Let's wait till she's--
Take it now. We're gonna want to remember this.
Oh, my God.
Jason, honey.
We were able to repair the damage,
but the next 24 hours are crucial.
But he can recover, right?
If-- if everything goes okay, he'll fully recover?
We're just focusing on getting Jason through the night.
I know it's hard,
but try not to think too far into the future.
I'm afraid to touch him.
I know right now all you can see
are the machines and the damage,
but he's still there.
Hey, there's my star resident.
Come on. We're drinking. I'm buying.
Oh, dude. Sorry, I can't.
Why not?
Stark ended up hating the guy
who assisted him today
even more than hates me.
Oh, God.
Anyway, there's a midgut volvulus, and I'm gonna assist.
You're going back to Stark?
I mean, the guy's a douche,
and-- and hips are cool,
but you know--
Just go.
I'm still awesome.
I've prescribed alpha blockers
and set you up in our free clinic.
You need anything at all... Call me.
We're gonna see you through this.
Thank you.
Hey.
I tried. I'm sorry. I, uh--
I'll be okay.
Dr. Webber slipped me some free samples,
so I'm good for a while.
Good. Good.
Well, good luck.
I have great medical insurance.
Way to kick a guy when he's down.
I'm saying, I'm-- I'm...
I'm saying that I'll marry you.
That's a really generous offer.
But I can't.
I'm a doctor.
I took an oath,
and I can't leave you now
any more than I could leave you bleeding out in the street.
This is absurd.
You're aware of that?
And you're gonna regret it deeply in the morning.
You're dying.
Henry, you're dying,
and you don't have to, 'cause I can help.
I mean it.
I'll marry you.
I want all post-op drains
removed on day three from now on
unless I tell you otherwise.
Do u know what this means, what you did?
What? What?
I was wondering if you wanted
to go out with me sometime, Dr. Bailey.
I mean, even that shocked,
"Oh, my god a nurse just asked me out.
How the hell do I get out of it?" expression
you got on right now is pretty cute.
Fine,
because you gave me day three.
And because I'm very handsome.
Yeah.
I know I agreed to have a drink with you.
But as I walked here,
I realized how unfair that was.
You know, it's-- it's-- it's unfair to you,
It's unfair to me, because...
Really, nothing has changed.
I- I mean, you're-- you're still
in a very different place in your life than I am,
and-- and you want different--
The goal of any surgery is total recovery...
to come out better than you were before.
Some patients heal quickly and feel immediate relief.
Oh, Lexie. I just got a page.
Bailey wants us back in the I.C.U.
Can you deal with it, please?
Hey.
Hey.
I have 21 pounds of trout.
How was it?
It was good.
For others the healing happens gradually.
And it's not until months or even years later
that you realize,
you don't hurt anymore.
Do you think Cristina's gonna be okay?
Mm. Yeah, I do.
Do you think she's gonna be a surgeon?
Honestly?
I don't know.
So the challenge after any surgery is to be patient.
Mark, did you forget your keys?
Okay, so picture this--
I'm in Africa, and everything's great,
and the people are so nice, and the clinic is amazing,
and I'm doing work that actually feels important.
Like, I can...
I can actually see that I'm making a difference,
but I'm crying, like, constantly.
And then this guy that work with at the clinic
finally asks me what's wrong,
and I say that I miss my girlfriend,
like-- like, I really miss her. So then he asks me
if I want to go back if they could replace me.
And-- and then I open my mouth to say "No..."
but what comes out weirdly instead is "Yes."
And so they did.
And then I came back.
You look really pretty.
But if you can make it through
the first weeks and months...
If you believe that healing is possible...
Then you can get your life back.
But that's a big if.
