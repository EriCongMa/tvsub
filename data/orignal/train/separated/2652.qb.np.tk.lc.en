hi .
breakfast is served .
i got , uh , juice , coffee ,
apple turnovers from pan lourdes ,
and , uh , no pancakes .
okay , great .
uh , let me help you with that .
i got it . i got it .
you shouldn &apos;t be lifting things .
well , my ribs feel better , so i &apos;m fine .
well , i &apos;ll be the judge of that .
let me just take a peek at this --
i prefer the bookish teacher .
well , then you &apos;re in luck , because , uh , i got a job --
a real job -- teaching history
at , uh , shorewood high school in boston .
boston ? you &apos;re gonna move to --
we &apos;re gonna move to boston .
i know -- i know you need , uh , time
to think about everything , and i get that ,
but what happened to you was terrifying .
okay ?
it was like a giant flashing sign from god
that you need to start over somewhere else .
if you don &apos;t want to do it for us ,
then do it ... for our kid .
our -- our kid ?
come here , buddy !
hey , there he is , hudson !
i @-@ i hate to break up this family reunion ,
but i got to go .
i got to check out the campus in , uh , boston .
so i &apos;ll clean this up before i go .
okay .
a teacher ?
there was a lot about our old life that i really liked ...
including you .
wait , wait .
oh , yes .
be safe .
edward weston was an associate of mine .
his murder remains unsolved --
the cause of his burns , a mystery ...
until now .
william dowd , found under the 14th street bridge this morning
sprinkled with burning lead .
uh , the marks and use of lead
are consistent with a medieval device subtly called ...
a lead sprinkler .
the device is used to shower victims with molten lead ,
or in the case of mr. dowd ,
to pour it into his mouth ,
causing serious inner burns and eventual death .
we boring you , donald ?
where &apos;s keen ?
you wouldn &apos;t be here without her if she was okay .
she &apos;s recovering nicely .
that &apos;s a relief .
i &apos;m sure it is .
you confiscated her firearm .
oh , so you think a convicted felon
should be allowed to carry guns .
all the ones i know do .
i see you &apos;ve started without me .
you should be recuperating .
take whatever time you need .
i appreciate that ,
and the cards and flowers and trashy novels --
especially the trashy novels , aram .
thank you .
but i am good .
don &apos;t let me interrupt .
what &apos;s the case ?
the holy vehm --
a vigilante group that operated in the germanic regions of europe
during the middle ages .
the vehmic court was sanctioned by the emperor
and directed by the archbishop to punish sinners .
what sins did these two commit ?
well , in the 15th century ,
the vehm meted out justice for heresy and witchcraft .
but today , who knows ?
during the height of their power ,
they killed thousands .
if i &apos;m correct and the vehm has been resurrected ,
there &apos;s no telling how many victims you &apos;ll be looking at .
aram , see what cold cases you can find
with even a remotely similar m.o.
ressler , navabi , find dowd &apos;s wife .
see what she knows .
what is that ?
some kind of metal ?
it &apos;s lead .
you should be resting .
i &apos;ll have aram order an analysis ,
see if we can trace that lead to a supplier .
i &apos;ve got agents working double time
to find the perps who attacked her .
that won &apos;t be necessary .
here . careful , it &apos;s loaded .
i &apos;m pregnant .
yes .
i &apos;ve known for some time .
how ?
everything .
your body , your skin , a look in your eyes ,
different tastes for different foods ,
nausea , distracted , moody .
yes .
with everything that was happening , i just ...
i mean , i guess i knew ,
but i just couldn &apos;t .
i bought a pregnancy test three weeks ago ,
and i threw it out before i took it .
i mean , i @-@ i was okay facing the cabal ,
but those two red lines --
i just ...
could not handle that .
i assume tom is the father .
i haven &apos;t told him .
he &apos;s still figuring his life out .
there &apos;s a job in boston .
i know you want to believe that our work is done ,
but it &apos;s not .
the addition of a child will make that ...
infinitely more difficult .
what they did to him . who would do such a thing ?
does your husband have any enemies ?
any problems at work ?
none .
william was a kind man and a great father .
he was involved in the community .
when our daughter was in school ...
how many kids do you have ?
one . amy .
there was something she &apos;s not telling us .
20 pictures on their fridge and not one of their daughter ?
you think something happened between them ?
we need to find her , see if she agrees
with the wife about his parenting skills .
i &apos;m guessing the answer &apos;s no .
father , forgive me , for i have sinned .
it &apos;s been a week since my last confession .
since that time , i have killed two men .
well done , my son ,
for you are the tip of his spear .
through your hands , his judgment is witnessed .
let us pray . our father ...
we &apos;ve linked the vehm &apos;s m.o. to a dozen murders .
each victim was subjected to some form of medieval torture .
sam archer was whipped until an artery burst
and he bled to death .
the bruising , fractures , and deep puncture wounds
indicate that joseph gibson &apos;s extremities were crushed
with some device called &quot; the spanish boot . &quot;
none of the victims had a record .
why were they targeted ?
we are not sure .
we &apos;re still going over case files .
sir .
from your wife .
those are beautiful .
my office .
what else do we know ?
they did find william dowd &apos;s daughter
living as lisa neil -- new name , new social .
she &apos;s definitely hiding from something .
or someone . we &apos;re on it .
is this a bad time ?
i thought you &apos;d rolled out .
that &apos;s actually why i &apos;m here .
ressler and i -- are we partners ?
would that be a problem ?
he did fire me .
yes . an appropriate action given the circumstances ,
but one he deeply regrets
and went to great lengths to rectify .
he did .
in a status report submitted to me
after i returned he was quite eloquent
about your value to the task force .
you &apos;re welcome to read it after you question lisa neil .
it &apos;s hard to forgive sometimes .
lisa neil .
yes , is this dr. meyer &apos;s office ?
i have an appointment next week for my son .
i think he &apos;s a threat to himself .
it &apos;s urgent that we see the doctor today .
lisa neil ?
can i help you ?
i &apos;m agent navabi , fbi .
this is agent ressler .
we have some questions for you about your father .
my father died years ago .
you , uh , must be confusing me with somebody else .
someone like amy dowd ?
hello ?
someone there ?
there was no one out front .
my secretary leaves at 5 : 00 .
you must be mr. harris .
yes .
where &apos;s your son ?
i was told the appointment is for him .
oh , it should be , but , you know ,
my wife doesn &apos;t really believe in therapy .
you know , she thinks people like you do more harm than good .
do you , dr. meyer ?
i @-@ i don &apos;t believe so .
why don &apos;t you come in .
tell me what &apos;s going on with your son .
my father was murdered ?
yes .
by people who thought he had , uh , sinned .
it might help us find his killer
if we knew whether that was true or not .
was it ?
yeah .
that &apos;s why i ran away .
so can i ask how you treat the children ?
you know , how it all works .
well , it &apos;s important for me to get a sense of the child ,
so the first few sessions would be one @-@ on @-@ one .
without a parent present ?
for me to gain their trust , it &apos;s best to start out that way .
i was 12 .
i came home from swimming at my friend &apos;s house ,
and i went into the basement to put my suit in the dryer ,
and he was there .
your father .
and someone else .
a boy .
when you &apos;re alone with my son , would you be touching him ?
absolutely not .
i &apos;m not even sure i understand your question .
i mean , would you think about touching him ?
i &apos;m sorry your son is having a hard time ,
but i think you should leave .
oh ... no ! no !
you hurt children .
what are you doing ?
no !
you earn their trust
and then you abuse them .
they said i was crazy .
that i was making it all up .
that my father never raped that little boy .
but i know the truth .
my father was a monster .
whoever killed him did the world a favor .
sooner or later ,
no !
we all pay for our sins .
what are you doing ?
what is this ? !
what are you doing ? !
i paid for mine ...
what are you talking about ! ?
... and it &apos;s time you paid for yours .
oh , we meet again . you must be the new neighbor .
i &apos;m zoe .
liz .
who &apos;s this ?
stanley .
hi , stanley !
hi , stanley .
he &apos;s so cute !
don &apos;t let that fool you . he &apos;s the devil child .
he hasn &apos;t slept the night through since ever .
well , we can stay up together .
i &apos;m expecting a little devil of my own .
oh , really ? that &apos;s amazing .
i mean , besides no sleep , no sex ,
and stretch marks the size of kansas ,
there are really great things about it .
i can &apos;t think of any , but that &apos;s what people say .
look , i &apos;m sure you have a thousand questions .
i &apos;m here , anytime . i &apos;m here all the time .
that &apos;s very nice of you .
i &apos;ll probably take you up on that . thanks .
i thought you were going to boston .
rescheduled for tomorrow .
felt like hanging out .
what &apos;s that ?
something i &apos;ve kept in my wallet
since the day you gave it to me .
is that ...
a hope . a wish .
the child that we were gonna adopt , and that , i hope ...
is the one we &apos;re gonna have .
you found my pro / con list . - pro --
chance for a normal life , family ,
doting husband with rock @-@ hard abs .
really ?
liz ... we &apos;re pregnant .
yeah .
we are .
but before you get too excited --
it &apos;s way too late for that .
i &apos;m thinking about giving the baby up for adoption .
why ? why ?
why would you do that ?
maybe you should take another look at the list .
i mean , there are only three pros
and , maybe , i can probably think of a hundred cons .
i &apos;m a felon .
people hate me . i &apos;m a pariah .
here , in d.c. that is why we have to move .
and the rest ?
dangerous job -- fixable .
unmarried -- totally fixable .
uh , unmarried was never a part of my list .
well , a guy can dream .
can &apos;t he ?
yeah . yeah , they &apos;re -- they &apos;re all fixable , tom ,
except for one --
reddington .
we can get away from him .
his life , my life ,
is so filled with violence and ...
anger and hatred and death .
how can i bring a child into that world ?
my world .
our world , liz .
not his . ours .
this is why i didn &apos;t want to tell you .
i knew you &apos;d be so annoyingly positive .
what , you don &apos;t want to be positive ?
i don &apos;t want to be naive !
just promise me that you &apos;ll keep an open mind . all right ?
about boston and us and ...
the little one .
what ?
i &apos;m pretty sure i put question marks next to your name .
did you ?
yeah .
that &apos;s weird , &apos; cause it looks like you changed your mind .
oh , my god .
i &apos;m a violent man .
i &apos;ve taken on a life that requires it .
i hurt people .
i kill people .
and each time i do , in that moment ,
another part of me dies along with them .
when i was young ,
i romanticized the life of an outlaw ...
bad guys .
that was a long time ago .
raymond .
yes .
the vehm are hunting pedophiles .
william dowd &apos;s daughter confirmed
that &apos;s what her father was .
you just won &apos;t rest , will you ?
i &apos;m pregnant , not sick .
besides , you &apos;re the one who said
there &apos;s a fight coming that can &apos;t be avoided .
tell me about the other victims .
they were never charged with any crimes ,
but hidden in their backgrounds are whispered accusations --
incidents that were swept under the rug .
so your theory is that
someone has reorganized a 15th @-@ century cult
to hunt and kill pedophiles .
it fits the fact pattern .
not all of them .
my associate , mr. weston ,
the man who started us down this road ,
was many things , but a pedophile was not one of them .
i saw his dark side , and it did not involve children .
what did it involve ?
maybe that &apos;s where we should look .
you &apos;re right .
of course .
what ?
of course what ?
thank you , lizzy .
you attacked a pregnant woman ,
broke three of her ribs ,
battered her so badly she was left lying unconscious
in a grocery @-@ store parking lot .
call mr. kaplan from the car .
we need to find gerald sullivan .
so , uh , our metallurgist broke down the lead
that was found on william dowd .
a specific dye was added to deepen the gray scale .
was it traceable ?
to an online company .
they made many sales , but only one stands out --
the st. james shelter .
it &apos;s a halfway house for ex @-@ cons in philadelphia .
they use the lead to make religious jewelry .
could be a location for the vehm .
ressler and i will check it out .
right .
you and ressler .
i know . it &apos;s strange .
but he got me my job back .
did he ?
in the status report he submitted to cooper ,
he lobbied for me .
he didn &apos;t have to , and he did .
well , i can &apos;t imagine it was difficult to write nice things .
i &apos;m glad he did . someone needed to .
where &apos;d everybody go ?
holy ...
damn it .
navabi !
hey , navabi !
you okay ?
yes . thank you for asking .
ressler &apos;s running his prints .
should have an i.d. soon .
he &apos;s a zealot , like my brother .
a true believer who twists the gospel
to justify murder .
i don &apos;t need to know his name to know who he is .
the files you found at st. james
contain detailed accounts of the victims .
the research they did was extensive .
they found details local cops clearly missed .
m.e. finished the autopsies
on the three vehm found at the scene .
says he &apos;s ready for a show @-@ and @-@ tell .
seemed pretty excited about it .
okay . okay , okay -- yes .
i admit , three fully shaved dudes is kind of weird .
it &apos;s not something you see every day , but then ...
well , then there &apos;s something that you almost ... never see .
you &apos;ve never seen a eunuch ?
w @-@ well , no . i ...
i &apos;ve seen a eunuch before .
in fact , i &apos;ve seen more eunuchs than i care to admit .
are they all eunuchs ?
sliced and diced . but the beauty part --
and i use that term advisedly , of course --
is that it &apos;s self @-@ inflicted .
he did this to himself ?
they all did .
yeah ?
prints came back .
the guy &apos;s name is harlan holt .
he served seven years at cumberland for , uh --
get this -- sexual assault of a minor .
so he &apos;s a pedophile .
who got early release by agreeing to castration
to mitigate his deviant desires .
the vehm at the morgue are castrated as well .
so the vehm are pedophiles ,
and their victims are pedophiles .
it &apos;s monsters hunting monsters .
let &apos;s talk about bobby sanders . he was 12 .
you were his teacher . he trusted you ,
and then you exploited that trust .
we know who you are , mr. holt .
my brothers and i are defenders of the innocent .
we subjected ourselves to mutilation
in order to cleanse impure thoughts ,
allowing us to embody god &apos;s will on earth .
we are the protectors of the children .
well , we got the case files that you kept on your victims .
you should tell us about them , these sinners .
william dowd .
hid behind the make @-@ up of a clown .
always chose the weakest child ,
the one who was too scared to tell .
what about arthur shepherd ?
a counselor for children with special needs .
the system did nothing despite an eyewitness .
what do you mean , did nothing ?
was the case thrown out ?
no charges were ever filed .
there &apos;s no justice in your justice system .
so we provide it .
an eyewitness to the abuse of a child with special needs ,
and no charges were filed ? that makes no sense .
case file on shepherd includes the eyewitness account .
how do they have case files ? they &apos;re not cops .
where did they get them ? who did they get them from ?
who took the eyewitness statement ?
a.d.a. in baltimore -- peter levy .
we need to call him ,
see if it ever happened .
i doubt it did .
where are you going with this ?
the vehm are zealots .
they &apos;ll kill anyone they &apos;re told is a pedophile .
what if someone &apos;s telling them
people are pedophiles that aren &apos;t ?
reddington says his friend wasn &apos;t .
what if the person bringing these case reports
is someone with their own agenda
and they &apos;re using the vehm to carry it out ?
my , god .
gerald , burying your business
in the dirt like a dog .
how the mighty have fallen .
what the hell is this ?
a terrible time of year to go camping ,
but i suppose we do what we must
when we &apos;re on the run .
brenda and i were just catching up .
she &apos;s not hungry , but i noticed
you packed some bratwurst and couldn &apos;t resist .
i do love a good cookout .
red ... it &apos;s not what you think .
i think you had weston killed ,
and locke , bosker , hundly .
someone is clearing the playing field , gerald ,
and my money is on you .
locke and bosker ?
they laundered for the cartels .
hundly cleaned cash for the sex trade .
i handled white @-@ collar crime .
i know how the market was divided .
in fact ,
i was impressed by how well you co @-@ existed
with your competitors -- until now .
you got greedy , gerald .
i &apos;m not on the run because i killed my competitors .
i &apos;m on the run because i don &apos;t want to be killed
by the people who did .
red , you know me . you know brenda .
you really think we &apos;d be living in the bentley
if we didn &apos;t have to ?
if you &apos;re not controlling the vehm , then who is ?
i &apos;m a dead man if i say .
i came here for one thing ,
but i &apos;ve decided i &apos;m gonna leave with two .
the first is the name of the person who controls the vehm .
and the second ?
a song , gerald .
i so wanted to be a scout --
tying knots , the pinewood derby ,
and the campfire songs .
oh , those songs .
i keep trying to explain to dembe ,
but i &apos;m no singer .
just one song !
♬ michael , row your boat ashore . ♬
yes !
♬ hallelujah ♬
♬ michael , row the boat ashore . ♬
right ?
♬ hallelujah ♬
♬ sister , help to trim the sails . ♬
♬ hallelujah ♬
♬ sister , help to trim the sails . ♬
that &apos;s enough .
okay , then .
just the name .
that &apos;s impossible .
that file . your file --
it says the eyewitness in the shepherd case
gave his statement to a baltimore a.d.a.
by the name of peter levy .
we called the baltimore district attorney .
there is no peter levy .
once we found out that case was false ,
we ... looked at the others .
jared locke &apos;s victim ?
well , he doesn &apos;t exist .
you were given a screen grab of a model
from a children &apos;s clothing website .
you killed william bosker for molesting his nephew
in akron ohio on june 23rd ?
well , the state department said
that he was living in london at the time .
you &apos;re being manipulated .
we need you to tell us by who .
that &apos;s a trust ...
i can &apos;t betray .
he &apos;s betrayed yours .
why don &apos;t you tell us before someone else is murdered ?
you don &apos;t understand . it &apos;s too late .
what do you mean ? too late ?
we received a new file yesterday .
there &apos;s a benefit at cleveland high school tonight .
okay , you need to tell me who the target is .
think back , harlan . think hard .
i need a name .
james wagner .
i &apos;m gonna ask you one last time .
who gave you these files ?
stop me if you &apos;ve heard this one .
a priest , a eunuch , and a pedophile
walk into a bar ...
excuse me ?
who are you ? what are you doing here ?
i &apos;m here to offer you the sacrament of confession .
i &apos;ll be your father confessor .
i know , the hypocrisy is staggering .
this is james wagner .
we have reason to believe
that there &apos;s an imminent threat on his life .
the principal is gonna speak first .
he &apos;s gonna talk about your charitable donations
and the scholarship program before the big announcement
that the auditorium is being named in your honor .
i need a smoke . i &apos;ll be back in five .
i don &apos;t think you &apos;re supposed to smoke on a school campus .
oh , what are they gonna do , suspend me ?
you know what my problem with religion is ?
man .
like anything that has a potential to be beautiful ,
man will turn it into something ugly .
for every saint , there are two million sinners .
which are you ?
like you , i &apos;m a sinner --
an envious one , i might add ,
as my transgressions are not nearly as divine
as the ones you &apos;ve been guilty of
during the years you &apos;ve been associated
with the vatican bank .
i &apos;m afraid you were misinformed .
i did work with the bank to bring an end
to an unfortunate era of waste and corruption .
generally speaking ,
i &apos;m not a huge fan of the incorruptible ,
but your new pontiff ?
he is not your father &apos;s holy father .
he has an undeniable decency , which you sorely lack .
yes . at his instruction ,
you helped to root out corruption .
so that the vatican bank
would no longer be in the money @-@ laundering business ,
but to paraphrase aristotle , corruption abhors a vacuum .
so you moved right in .
you and your little band of eunuchs .
kudos on that , by the way .
gathering sick men ,
tricking them into thinking they &apos;re killing pedophiles
when , in fact , they &apos;re killing money launderers
whose business you covet ?
the vehm cleanse the world of god &apos;s mistakes .
their other targets are necessary sacrifices
for the good of the holy church .
no sin in murder or money laundering ,
so long as it serves our father here on earth ...
or you .
donald ressler , fbi .
i understand you &apos;re james wagner &apos;s assistant .
i am . i @-@ is something wrong ?
i need to see him right now .
he stepped out .
call him .
he has me hold his phone .
he says it messes up the lines in his suit .
i have nothing to confess to you .
oh , that .
i wasn &apos;t really interested in hearing it .
although i suppose life in the abbey
must be full of intrigue .
what i am interested in is a proposition .
care to hear it ?
you have a job for the vehm ?
i do . one that should appeal to you .
it &apos;s a money launderer --
a formidable player who presents a significant obstacle
to anyone interested in clearing the playing field .
who is it ?
contact the vehm . tell them to meet us here .
i &apos;ll explain everything then . not before .
they &apos;re busy .
the fbi raided their chamber of horrors --
killed one , captured some others .
they &apos;ll talk .
and when they do , they &apos;ll talk about you .
so , my proposition is this .
do what i &apos;m asking , do it now ,
and i &apos;ll make sure you go someplace quiet
where the fbi will never find you .
up here ! around the corner !
what happened ?
i @-@ i i don &apos;t know . i don &apos;t know .
we heard some kind of fight ,
but when we got here , he was alone .
reddington ?
ladies !
what a pleasant surprise .
especially you , agent keen .
i didn &apos;t expect to see you in the field .
well , i am a ... a consultant .
i came to consult with cardinal richards .
are you drinking communion wine ?
yes . god , it &apos;s god @-@ awful .
if they &apos;d only switch to a good burgundy ,
people would be much more devout .
where is the cardinal ?
meeting with congregants .
something about church finances .
what , you &apos;re arresting me for smoking ?
smoking on school grounds is a public health law violation .
i was attacked .
we &apos;re searching for the people who assaulted you .
exactly . yes , those nutjobs assaulted me .
i &apos;m the victim .
today you are .
but the people who victimized you ?
those nutjobs ? they go after two types of people --
pedophiles and money launderers .
i am not a pedophile !
then maybe you launder money .
but thanks to you lighting up ,
i can hold you until we find out .
watch your head , pal .
the vehm are the congregants the cardinal is meeting with .
do they know he deceived them ?
yes .
i &apos;ve done business with a few of the people
they were tricked into killing .
so it was easy enough to provide the details necessary
to show them they &apos;d been terribly misled .
where did they take him ?
i have no idea .
they &apos;re gonna kill him .
probably .
hell hath no fury like a fundamentalist scorned .
女人受轻慢而生的怒火 比地狱里的还可怕
how did you contact the vehm ?
the cardinal did it for me .
he was quite excited about it , actually .
in exchange for the promise to keep the fbi from finding him ,
he agreed to sic the vehm on one last money launderer .
i omitted the fact that the cleaner
he was inviting the vehm to kill was , in fact , himself .
the cardinal took out the others in order to expand his business .
did you take him out to expand yours ?
yes .
to raise capital in preparation for war .
what war ?
ours .
holt just gave us a detailed list
of every member of the vehm .
so it &apos;ll just be a matter of time
before we have them all in custody .
anything on cardinal richards ?
nothing yet , but main justice has confirmed
that he used various charities
to launder profits from offshore gambling , so ...
all in all , i &apos;d say it was a pretty good day .
liz , could you give us a second ?
yeah , of course .
listen , i know i &apos;ve been prickly with you , and i &apos;m sorry .
i read what you wrote about me in the status report ,
and i just wanted to thank you .
i didn &apos;t write about you in the status report .
the report you submitted to cooper .
you lobbied to get my job back .
i don &apos;t know who told you that ,
but , uh , i didn &apos;t lobby cooper to get your job back ,
because i didn &apos;t believe that you should &apos;ve gotten it back .
i see .
i mean , look , it &apos;s nothing personal ,
but with reddington being such a wild card ,
the rest of us need to know where we stand .
i &apos;m not so sure i know with you .
okay , well , it &apos;s nothing personal ,
but ... you sucked in bed .
so , how &apos;d it go ?
the job fell through .
i don &apos;t understand . i thought you already had it .
i did .
reddington .
it doesn &apos;t matter . i &apos;ll figure something else out .
which he &apos;ll find out about and then sabotage ,
especially if it means me going away .
i know you think i &apos;m overreacting ,
but i just want to know that my kid ...
our kid .
i want to know my kid is protected .
he or she will be ... liz , by me .
by us .
look , i have something else lined up , all right ?
it &apos;s just gonna take me some time to get it going .
i do have some say in whether or not
we put our child up for adoption .
if what i &apos;m gonna try falls through ,
if reddington interferes , then maybe you &apos;re right .
maybe i &apos;ll be okay with it , but i &apos;m not ...
right now .
i &apos;ll be back tomorrow . can we talk about it then ?
sure .
i wish you didn &apos;t have to go home to that empty apartment .
i don &apos;t know . i &apos;m kind of into empty .
i get to ...
take my time .
fill it with what i want .
make it my own .
a new start .
okay . you ready ?
yeah .
what are we gonna do with you today ?
what are you doing here ?
i missed you .
yeah , i , uh , dyed my hair to hide .
i don &apos;t need to hide anymore .
lizzy , i misspoke earlier ...
about your child .
i said that having it would be ...
inconvenient .
you got me a couch .
when your mother was pregnant with you ,
it was terribly inconvenient .
the cold war was ending .
our country was ... falling apart .
everything she had ever known ...
she dreaded having a child .
almost aborted it .
not one day of her pregnancy
did she ever think of you as anything but a curse .
and then , from the second you were born ...
there was never a day when she ...
thought you were anything but a blessing .
in my experience ,
there is never a convenient time to have a child .
it certainly isn &apos;t a convenient time for you .
but if in saying that ,
i left you with the impression
that i didn &apos;t think you should have your baby ,
i &apos;m sorry for that ,
because nothing could be further from the truth .
tom .
what i did was for your protection .
taking his job away .
i &apos;m not a threat to your safety , lizzy , or your child &apos;s .
on the contrary , i can guarantee it ,
but i cannot do that if you run away .
you &apos;re the only reason i need protection .
i wish it were that simple .
i think you should leave .
yeah .
oh , i should probably mention ,
i booked a pregnancy massage for you .
she &apos;ll be here at 9 : 00 .
her name &apos;s edwina , she &apos;s a registered nurse ,
and she smells absolutely divine .
i hope it goes with the rest of your stuff .
i &apos;m told it pulls out .
thank you , aram .
you &apos;re welcome .
uh , what ... for , exactly ?
i know it was you who wrote about me in ressler &apos;s report .
that .
too many gerunds ?
he didn &apos;t even know .
what did you do , hack into his computer ?
look , i know it was the wrong thing to do ,
but this task force needs you .
i don &apos;t deserve a friend like you .
maybe not .
you have one .
cardinal richards . they found him .
♬ you know you didn &apos;t understand me ♬
oh , uh , sir , i didn &apos;t-- i didn &apos;t know that--
♬ i didn &apos;t say it was a problem ♬
it &apos;s okay , aram . it &apos;s fine .
are you , uh ...
are you sleeping here ?
charlene and i have separated .
i &apos;m looking for a place .
until i find one ...
♬ before you start to make assumptions ♬
i am so sorry .
yeah .
i am too .
♬ let &apos;s try to cut to the solution ♬
want a drink ?
yeah , i don &apos;t ...
but i do have some limeade in the fridge downstairs ,
along with these cherry turnovers
that agent keen brought in that are ...
amazing .
sharing one ?
♬ you can &apos;t just throw it in the trailer ♬
sure , why not ?
and aram ...
yeah .
if you could keep this between us .
of course .
women .
zoe , it &apos;s your neighbor , liz .
could use some company .
where &apos;s zoe ?
reddington moved her out .
got her a bigger apartment .
why ?
for your security .
we &apos;ll keep a man in this apartment 24 hours a day .
anybody who wants to get you will have to come past us .
nice hair .
