oleg , the people at table two
want to know what &apos;s in the veggie burger .
no . they don &apos;t .
eh . that &apos;s fine .
they wanted refills ,
so i &apos;m probably not gonna go back there anyway .
where &apos;s max ?
this plate has been here so long ,
the salmon is turning into salmonella .
she took a break with the new dishwasher .
max , i thought you slipped out the back .
he did for a minute , but i popped him back in .
this just in , work is so much more fun
when you &apos;re sleeping with a co @-@ worker .
max , that was good .
it was five hail marys good .
i think we made these dishes dirtier .
max , he &apos;s cute ,
but how can you even stay hard with that accent ?
&quot; come here , max . i wanna hump ya a wee bit . &quot;
what can i say , i always had a thing
for the guy on the box of lucky charms .
hey , everybody .
look , i got me a fitbit .
13 , 14 , 15 ...
only 200,000 more steps
before i get a bit more fit for my wedding .
that &apos;s impressive .
i couldn &apos;t even make it through 12 steps .

hey , max .
how &apos;s my maid of honor ?
hey , caroline .
how &apos;s my run @-@ of @-@ the @-@ mill wedding guest ?
i &apos;m doing great . did that sound convincing ?
&apos;cause i &apos;ve been practicing it in the bathroom mirror
for an hour every morning .
i know , i &apos;ve got to stop sitting on the toilet
while you do that .
max , let &apos;s talk bridesmaid dresses .
i don &apos;t care , i &apos;ll wear anything .
i wore a greyhound bus driver &apos;s uniform to my prom .
i was coming straight from work .
well , i have decided to wear
grandma kuchenski &apos;s wedding gown .
yeah , all of the women in my family wore it .
everyone except aunts svetti and letti ,
&apos;cause , well , they &apos;re attached at the abdomen .
there she is .
the hot sauce for my huevos mancheros .
hey , sophie , baby , i got you what you want .
oleg , no one wants hepatitis .
it &apos;s official .
our wedding &apos;s gonna be in the times .
oleg , how are you gonna be in the times ?
the times tends to be picky
and you tend to be more &quot; picky your nose . &quot;
you know , my second wedding made the times .
&apos;cause my first wife showed up and shot me in the leg .
that &apos;s vlanka , my sister .
she &apos;s my other bridesmaid .
yeah , we &apos;re not that close , but i feel bad for her
&apos;cause she &apos;s one of those adults with freckles .
max , you &apos;re going to be in the times !
in the times , wearing god knows what sophie will pick .
i mean , she has a drawer full of diamond tiaras for the gym .
hello , what are you two talking about ?
deciding which tables to ignore ?
we &apos;re talking about sophie &apos;s taste .
oh , bitch , please .
come on .
my morning fiber cookie has better taste than sophie .
girls , vlanka &apos;s out .
she has an attitude and freckles .
yeah . i mean , that &apos;s too far .
so , caroline , congratulations !
you &apos;re my new bridesmaid !
okay , i found a bridesmaid &apos;s dress that i like .
but the only way we can afford it is
if i sell you to that armenian guy on craigslist .
no way .
i get sick of hummus after four bites .
max , we have to take charge of this .
because whatever bridesmaid &apos;s dress sophie picks
is like a tyler perry movie .
但导演奖提名是0次 金酸莓奖则被提名过11次
i don &apos;t have to see it to know it &apos;s gonna be awful .
we &apos;ll find something classy , and beautiful ,
and just shove it down her throat .
who &apos;s shoving what down whom ?
and if you don &apos;t have a story , i do .
john , max and i got roped into being bridesmaids .
stop .
you had me at rope .
you lost me at bridesmaids .
i &apos;ll be at the hostess stand , looking at dresses
and silently wishing for an asteroid
to wipe us off the planet .
if wishes made things happen , we &apos;d been in the middle
of a zombie apocalypse right now .
hey , girls .
my dress just arrived from poland
and i &apos;m bustin &apos; for you to see it .
see it while i eat one of your $ 14 puddings .
sophie , i &apos;ve been looking at color choices ,
and how would you feel about us in a nude ?
max could go nude but
you don &apos;t have the rack to pull it off .
does anyone have a knife ?
max , why do you have a switchblade
to work in a dessert bar ?
my mother always told me to carry protection .
wait &apos; til you see grandma kuchenski &apos;s dress .
they don &apos;t make them like they used to .
you know , forced gypsy labor is illegal now .
here we go .
sophie , was your grandma the crypt keeper ?
what &apos;s going on out here ?
what &apos;s all that white powder in the air ?
i &apos;m trying to run a restaurant , not an 80 &apos;s disco .
oh , put a sock in it .
i &apos;m buying one of your freaking overpriced puddings .
i &apos;d get mad but i &apos;m mildly attracted to you right now .
just mildly ?
i mean , now i &apos;m getting mad .
sorry . wedding drama .
her dress just fell completely to pieces ...
like i &apos;m assuming i &apos;ll do in the near future .
whatever you need bridal ,
go to rosenfeld &apos;s in brooklyn .
that &apos;s where i got my dress when i was broke and straight .
so you weren &apos;t always into women ?
of course i was .
except those three years in scientology .
well , it looks like the three of us
are going to go dress shopping now .
yeah . and you know , i got to go wash my hands
&apos;cause they &apos;re covered in old lady dna .
well , that &apos;s that .
shopping with sophie is like when i worked
in a thai massage parlor .
we are going down .
not if we go before sophie
and hide every ugly bridesmaid &apos;s dress that sophie would like .
if she can &apos;t see them , she can &apos;t make us wear them .
how did you come up with that so fast ?
it &apos;s the same plan i used in 2010
when i was a bridesmaid for chelsea clinton .
bad dress and then her father followed me into the coat room .
look at this place .
it reminds me of that movie .
bridesmaids ?
no , nightmare on elm street .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re worried about , caroline .
i think they &apos;re all quite lovely .
nash , please .
you &apos;re a poor person from ireland .
i &apos;ll ask your opinion when i need to know where to go
to get free leg braces .
you were right , max .
she can be a real &quot; b &quot; sometimes .
i &apos;m sorry , but i don &apos;t even know why he &apos;s here .
bonin &apos; o &apos;brien here ...
is gonna distract the sales lady
while we hide the ugly dresses .
hello , ladies .
same plan .
who &apos;s the lucky bride ?
or should i say , who &apos;s the lucky cradle robber ?
don &apos;t mind me .
it &apos;s just my crazy sense of humor .
oh , the ladies here love it .
the call me &quot; crazy carl . &quot;
&quot; did you hear what crazy carl said ? &quot;
they just love it .
i &apos;m caroline .
this is max and he isn &apos;t the groom .
no , no , no .
he &apos;s single and gay . yes .
so gay , he got kicked out of one direction .
why don &apos;t you two walk off somewhere
and share poignant coming @-@ out stories .
go .
but max--
oh , you heard the women , go .
can do .
ladies , look around , we &apos;ll be back ...
in about a month .
tahiti anyone ?
i &apos;m just crazy carl .
the ladies love it .
bridesmaid &apos;s dresses should be called what they are .
really expensive donations to goodwill .
is this one bad ?
no . that &apos;s a vera wang .
but this is a very wrong .
hide it .
ew . and it &apos;s evil twin .
oh , i didn &apos;t know hazmat suits came with feathers .
oh my god .
this the worst thing i &apos;ve ever seen .
and i &apos;ve seen a prostitute change her tampon on the sidewalk .
who are you calling a prostitute ?
this , we &apos;ve got to hide .
i can &apos;t get this dress off .
just tell it you work at google
and you &apos;re thinking of settling down .
lift it up . lift it up . dump it back there .
stop !
you put butterscotch betty down .
oh , we were just looking for a price tag .
i know what &apos;s going on here .
you &apos;re hiding the good dresses
to make sure no one else can get them
at our annual half @-@ off sale tomorrow .
yeah , that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing .
we &apos;re hiding the good dresses .
in fact , i just caught another sneaky sue .
oh , i &apos;m sophie .
oh , look at the color .
that &apos;s not color . that &apos;s radiation .
that dress is a one of a kind .
meaning there &apos;s only one ?
no , we have two .
and i have two bridesmaids !
i love it when life works out perfect like this .
ladies , our half @-@ off sale will begin in a minute .
look at this place .
there are more desperate women crammed in here
than the splash zone at a kenny chesney concert .
i know . it &apos;s like black friday at walmart
and like black friday , hopefully someone will trample me .
cause thanks to these dresses , my life is over .
max , did you hear me ?
my life is over .
you said that when the chinese food place forgot the duck sauce .
well , i &apos;m sorry , but i had a whole other scenario planned
for my return to the times .
&quot; entrepreneur rises from the ashes . &quot;
now , i &apos;m just going to be in the times ,
looking like a stupid ash .
shoot , girl , just push on through .
i &apos;m pushing , girl . i am pushing .
excuse us .
excuse us .
excuse us .
just go , girl .
i don &apos;t want anybody else to get those two yellow dresses .
max , did you hear that ?
someone has worst taste than sophie .
let them through .
now we just have to hang back here
and let them get to those dresses first .
yay ! my life is good again .
max , caroline , up here .
what was that , like , a second ?
i saved you a space upfront .
come on .
well , it &apos;s over .
as soon as they cut that ribbon ,
sophie &apos;s going to marshawn lynch everyone who
gets in the way of us and those dresses .
there &apos;s only one way out of this .
and you called it earlier .
you have to let them trample you .
i &apos;m serious .
i &apos;m not about to be trampled on purpose .
see if you still feel that way
after i say these next few words :
&quot; pictured from left , caroline channing . &quot;
try to fend off any heels you see heading for my eyes .
attention , ladies .
as you see , i have the big scissors ,
which can only mean it &apos;s time ...
to trim some nose hairs !
that carl is crazy .
the annual bridal sale ...
is now ...
max , hold my hand .
open !
ladies , ladies , one at a time .
well , i may be limping down the aisle ,
but at least i won &apos;t be limping in something swiffer might sell
to dust off ceiling fans .
oh , my god , girl ! here she comes !
here she comes .
my girl , rhonda , had that dress first .
oh , your girl is gonna have to
pry it out of my cold , dead hands .
hey , max , caroline !
try it on !
follow me to the changing room .
i &apos;m never coming out in this dress , i &apos;m scared .
so on the count of one , two ...
maybe it &apos;s not that bad .
it &apos;s bad .
it &apos;s bad .
okay . so you &apos;re telling me ,
versace got murdered ,
but no one &apos;s taken out whoever made these ?
i know .
i feel like tweety bird is gonna sue us
华纳兄弟旗下卡通系列中一角
for copyright infringement .
i feel like we should have giant toilet paper rolls under here .
well , maybe we &apos;ll like these better
when we &apos;re out of this bright light .
max , we are the bright light .
ladies , you forgot the matching hats .
there &apos;s more ?
oh , if anyone finds a xanax , it &apos;s mine .
it was knocked out of my hand by two women duking it out
over a chintz mermaid dress .
oh , now it looks good .
there &apos;s xanax on the loose and i &apos;m just standing here ?
at least if i was high , i &apos;d have an excuse to be wearing this .
here pilly , pilly .
here pilly , pilly , pilly .
girl , for real ,
you look like straight up crap in that dress .
for real .
you white girls can &apos;t pull that color off .
that &apos;s a waste of poppin &apos; lemon yellow .
i know .
i am way too white for this .
she &apos;s also too white to say &quot; turnt up &quot; all the time ,
but that hasn &apos;t stopped her .
this dress was not my choice .
i hate everything about it .
this is a disaster .
this is &quot; dressageddon . &quot;
yeah , but in a good way .
you two don &apos;t want to wear the dresses .
you don &apos;t have to .
but i thought you wanted us to match
the balloons and the ducks .
max , she said we don &apos;t have to wear the dress .
don &apos;t question her !
that &apos;s like questioning a prison guard
when he says you &apos;re free to go .
sophie , are you sure you don &apos;t care ?
oh , yeah . sure .
yeah , they &apos;re all yours , destiny &apos;s child .
this is ten pounds of ugly junk .
reminds me of this bartender , pete , i used to date .
come to think of it , that made me gag , too .
okay . done .
listen , crying in a women &apos;s dressing room ?
whoever it is , girl , big butts are in .
that &apos;s sophie &apos;s cry .
i know , &apos; cause i hear it through the vent
when she watches nashville .
sophie ?
no .
are you okay ?
it &apos;s not me , but i &apos;m okay .
sophie , why are you crying ?
when i heard what you said about the dresses ...
it &apos;s just--
it &apos;s almost , kind of like ,
you think i have bad taste or something .
no .
caroline thinks you have great taste .
she does ?
well , then she should say so .
now .
well , sophie , i think you have your own unique style .
and i think ...
that i didn &apos;t hear the words &quot; great &quot; or &quot; taste . &quot;
sophie , what do you even care what i think ?
just say it !
sophie , i think you have great taste .
you do ?
then , what are we doing sitting here ?
let &apos;s go and get those dresses back !
come on . help me !
those other girls already took them .
what ?
well , at least we don &apos;t have to wear those ugly ,
yellow bridesmaid dresses at the wedding .
yup . now , you only have to wear
ugly , yellow dresses here , every night .
this is the best thing that &apos;s happened to me
since i realized that weird mole on my arm was
just a grape @-@ nut and not cancer .
girls , great news .
you stuffed han in the microwave
and you &apos;re ready to hit power ?
come on . we &apos;ve tried .
you know he doesn &apos;t fit .
the one thing he &apos;s too big for .
no , i got ilia jorbich to be our wedding photographer .
he &apos;s the best photographer at the warsaw times .
well , he &apos;s the only one who still has both arms .
wait , it &apos;s the warsaw times ?
all this time , i &apos;ve been thinking it was the new york times .
new york times ?
this is much more exclusive .
you can only get it in two places .
poland and the deli in new jersey that sells missiles .
this is amazing .
my comeback in the new york times has been preserved .
max , i &apos;m gonna go ahead and smile .
my life is good again .
don &apos;t smile yet , &apos; cause sophie told me
that because you said she had such good taste ,
she &apos;s designing our dresses herself .
what was that , like a second ?
yup . you just went from the best of times
to the warsaw times .
