&quot; don &apos;t dream it &apos;s over &quot;
we teach residents ,
&quot; when you hear hoofbeats , think horses , not zebras . &quot;
wait , i know this is derek shepherd &apos;s phone .
who -- who is this ?
it means that the most obvious answer is usually right .
it keeps doctors from heading down the wrong path .
it helps us stick to the truth . it helps us save lives .
it &apos;s part of what makes me a good surgeon .
when i hear hoofbeats ...
horses .

martin ? martin , i &apos;m here .
i &apos;m his wife .
sally ?
i @-@ i just want some shoes .
ma &apos;am , has he been drinking ?
drinking ? no .
my -- my husband has alzheimer &apos;s .
he has no idea what he &apos;s done .
all i needed was t @-@ to take a shower .
i left martin with the football game on -- he likes football .
but t @-@ the keys .
i always hide the keys . i must have footten .
he would never , ever hurt a soul .
i &apos;m so sorry he hit those people with the car .
your , um , husband has multiple rib fractures ,
and there &apos;s evidence that there &apos;s blood in his belly .
he &apos;s gonna need exploratory surgery
to see how extensive the damage is .
okay . uh , okay . um , thank you .
mrs. davis , we need to ask you some questions .
okay , grey ,
you and i will take care of the pelvic packing .
torres , reduce the femur fracture .
mm @-@ hmm . any word on the driver ?
alzheimer &apos;s . he thinks he &apos;s in a shoe store .
oh , my god . are you okay ?
it &apos;s nothing . it &apos;s fine .
did derek call ?
nope .
he will .
we &apos;ll see .
it &apos;s okay .
you got scanned ? everything checked out okay ?
absolutely .
okay .
let &apos;s go scrub .
okay .
damn it , these pelvic veins are shattered .
more lap pads . see that , grey ?
i see it . i got it . clamp . 3 @-@ 0 silk .
you know what ? i didn &apos;t even kiss her . she kissed me .
so why -- why am i compelled to apologize to arizona ?
suction , edwards . more . lap pads .
i mean , i didn &apos;t do anything wrong .
did i ?
more lap pads . pack it in there .
and why does she have to make it so weird ?
and -- and what is my responsibility here ?
i mean , time has passed .
i can date . she can date .
i want her to date . we can see other people .
arizona was seeing other people
while the two of you were still married .
sorry .
i just meant i think you can do whatever you want .
god knows she did .
the look on his wife &apos;s face -- she felt responsible .
she should feel responsible .
i can &apos;t believe that woman . it &apos;s like criminal negligence .
it &apos;s like going to the movies and leaving your infant at home .
if an infant could start a car and mow down innocent people .
did you , uh , you want me to put a figure @-@ eight stitch in here ?
i mean , i &apos;m not insensitive . i mean , i get that it &apos;s hard .
but , you know , if you can &apos;t be a responsible caregiver ,
then find someone who can .
do you need some water , dr. warren ?
i think dr. warren &apos;s trying to subtly tell you to shut up .
i lost my wife to alzheimer &apos;s .
richard , i &apos;m so sorry . i had no idea .
oh , it &apos;s okay .
you had no way of knowing about her or ...
what ?
it &apos;s nothing . i just ... i wouldn &apos;t wish it on anyone .
there &apos;s some clear fluid oozing from the tear .
uh , give me a 5cc syringe to sample it .
it &apos;s not a big deal . it &apos;s just a cut .
it &apos;s a very deep cut .
it &apos;s not any dizziness it &apos;s or blurred vision ?
i keep telling everyone i feel fine ,
except for the fact that i &apos;m exhausted and ginormous .
you got anything for swollen feet ?
i &apos;d still like to order a head c.t. ,
just to be safe .
so , your husband &apos;s in a punk @-@ rock band ?
yeah . we met at a show .
mm . i used to like punk rock once .
okay .
what ? i did .
i rocked the heavy eyeliner , and i had some t @-@ shirts .
sure you did , robbins .
hey , uh , shepherd , how &apos;s pierce ?
huh ?
her exam .
it &apos;s more of a post @-@ punk scene now .
or proto @-@ punk ? i don &apos;t remember the differ ...
blair ?
we &apos;ve got a seizure . blair !
wilson , grab her arms .
blair . dr. bailey , a little help .
where do you want me ?
help us hold her steady .
push 10 of lorazepam . pupil &apos;s blown on the right .
she was conscious and talking just 10 seconds ago .
walking and talking -- classic extradural hematoma .
how pregnant is she ?
35 weeks . she &apos;s 35 weeks pregnant .
she isn &apos;t responding . start her on phenobarbital .
she needs an airway .
all right , give me a 7 @-@ 0 and a scope .
well , it &apos;s swollen , is the problem .
you likely won &apos;t lose your tongue .
lose my tongue ?
yeah , the bigger problem is , why were you stupid enough
to stick it in there in the first place ?
&apos;cause now your tongue is gonna continue to swell ,
pulling the bottle deeper into your mouth
and cutting off your airway .
and then you &apos;re gonna die .
die ? !
yeah , well , i &apos;m sorry , but you kind of did this to yourself .
dr. kepner , can i see you for a second ?
absolutely .
one sec .
all right , listen , i really just think we need to --
w @-@ what are you doing ?
i thought you wised up .
no , we need to -- we need to talk .
your first day back has already turned into your second ,
and you &apos;re tearing into patients --
i am topless . why are we talking about this ?
april .
what is the matter ?
what &apos;s the matter is that you keep holding me
like this delicate flower that &apos;s gonna break
every time you look at me .
that is what is the matter .
i &apos;m gonna go pull a bottle out of this moron &apos;s mouth .
i will see you at home .
how we doing with that airway ?
i can &apos;t get the tube in . her teeth are gritted .
how long has it been ?
we &apos;re almost at four minutes .
persistent decels . the baby &apos;s in trouble .
the seizures are frying her brain .
arizona , we need to put her under .
okay , okay . push 100 of sux and 20 of etomidate .
oh . she stopped .
oh , thank god .
starting compressions .
paddles !
push one of epi .
come on , blair .
okay , let &apos;s charge to 200 . everybody off .
clear .
still v @-@ fib .
again . charge to 300 .
clear .
arizona .
push another epi -- 360 . clear .
charging again .
arizona .
call it .
time of death -- 23 : 16 .
i don &apos;t -- she was just talking to us .
what happened that fast ?
massive intracranial bleed .
can &apos;t come back from that .
poor thing .
major tranq . jo , you start bagging the patient .
restarting cpr .
wait , what ?
bag the patient .
why ?
shut up and do what i said .
she &apos;s dead . why are we doing cpr ?
we have to keep her blood circulating .
for what ?
look , the mom &apos;s dead ,
but as long as you pump that bag ,
her baby &apos;s still alive .
oh . so --
it &apos;s time to deliver the baby .
right here , right now ?
right here , right now .
somebody page karev 911 . tell him get down here . 10 blade .
wait ! betadine !
we forgot to put betadine on her belly
so that she &apos;s sterile .
don &apos;t need it .
no , we do , because it &apos;s sta--
we don &apos;t need it !
she &apos;s dead , jo . mom &apos;s dead .
there &apos;s nothing left to protect her from .
thank you , doctor .
how &apos;s the father ?
oh , if he makes it through the night ,
he may have a chance .
um ...
does ... maggie know that ellis had alzheimer &apos;s ?
i don &apos;t know . we never talked about it .
don &apos;t you think one of us should tell her ?
i mean , she might want to find out , in case she --
i didn &apos;t want to know for a long time .
well , what changed your mind ?
i just realized not knowing isn &apos;t going to change anything .
it made me feel like i was in control , but i wasn &apos;t .
whatever is gonna happen is gonna happen , no matter what .
dr. webber , uh , the driver , martin davis --
you need to come .
what &apos;s it ?
i &apos;m not sure .
mrs. davis .
what did you do ?
he &apos;s back .
what do you mean ?
he -- he knows who i am , who he is , where he is .
he &apos;s remembering everything i &apos;m telling him .
martin , the poem -- say it again .
sally , hon , you got to let me catch me up , here .
no .
fine .
o lift me from the grass .
i die , i faint , i fail .
let thy love in kisses rain .
on my lips and eyelids pale .
he read it to me when he proposed .
i haven &apos;t heard it in years .
now , will someone please tell me what &apos;s going on ?
you cured him . you brought him back to me .
thank you .
what the hell did we do ?
i have no idea .
say it again .
o lift me from the grass .
i die , i faint , i fail .
let thy love in kisses rain
on my lips and eyelids pale .
my cheek is cold and white , alas !
is your hand cramping ?
yeah .
mine too .
somebody paged me ?
my heart beats loud and fast .
oh , crap .
oh , press it close to thine again .
are you ready ? - yeah .
where it will break at last .
okay . here we go .
the minute the baby &apos;s out , we can stop doing cpr .
he &apos;s out . he &apos;s out .
he &apos;s not crying . arizona ?
i know , not crying . uh , karev , stand by .
bailey , the cord .
okay .
okay .
karev , how is he ? alex ?
do you need some help over there ?
would everybody shut up ?
come on , little guy . come on .
one minute apgar is eight .
he &apos;s okay .
good breath sounds , heart &apos;s strong .
strong lungs , too .
wilson , you can go .
nice save , robbins .
wait , wait , wait , go back .
so , i missed lisa &apos;s wedding and her divorce ?
he was a bum , just like you said .
eh . this is weird .
it &apos;s -- it &apos;s like i stepped into a time machine
and went to the future .
and he &apos;s never had lucid days in the past ? it &apos;s pretty common .
never -- nothing like this .
oh ! toby is in his second year at penn state .
toby ? stupid toby ?
he pulled it together !
how about heidi ? how &apos;s heidi ?
17 and going strong . heidi &apos;s our cat .
five years . this is just ...
this must have been awful for you .
i missed you .
i missed you so much .
i &apos;m pretty confident
dr. webber has not found a cure for alzheimer &apos;s .
i have a suspicion , but i would like to get an mri
and confirm before we jump to any conclusions .
okay .
um , sally told me that i was in a car accident .
was anyone else injured , or --
actually , there was --
well , i know you have a lot of questions .
let &apos;s talk after we have all the answers .
uh , right now , dr . shepherd needs to get that mri .
hey . how &apos;s the baby doing ?
i &apos;d love to have some good news before the dad wakes up .
hi . how &apos;s he doing ?
vitals are stable . he &apos;s hanging in there .
good .
i heard about the mom . you okay ?
yeah . it was ... it was bad .
i &apos;m so sorry .
callie ... um , about earlier .
yeah , that was --
how long has that been going on , exactly ?
it hasn &apos;t .
i mean , that was our first date , and it got cut short ,
so we didn &apos;t even make it to dinner .
yeah , no , so she just skipped right to dessert .
you know what ? let &apos;s not do this .
i &apos;m -- i &apos;m sorry . you know what ?
i probably shouldn &apos;t be saying anything , but i -- ugh .
i feel like i have to .
you don &apos;t .
arizona , i am seeing people . i will kiss them .
i didn &apos;t plan on that happening ,
and i certainly didn &apos;t plan on you seeing that ,
but i do not need to feel bad or apologize .
no , callie , i ...
i &apos;m moving on , and you should , too ,
and it &apos;s kind of not your business
who i see now , or kiss , okay ?
you &apos;re right . godspeed . go ... kiss everyone .
24 @-@ hour monitoring . he needs q1 neurochecks .
use pressors to keep his maps above 60 .
if he &apos;s still stable ,
torres can go back into the pelvis tomorrow .
&quot; if &quot; ?
there &apos;s no guarantee he &apos;ll make it through the night .
so , just to , um , clarify ,
is this dr. torres &apos; patient , officially ,
or yours , or dr. grey &apos;s ?
i @-@ is this about her streak ?
dr. grey has not lost a patient since november .
we are all pulling for her --
well , stop it .
dr. grey .
if this guy dies , his little boy has no parents .
and if he &apos;s lucky enough to pull through this ,
his life isn &apos;t gonna look anything like it did before this .
is that really something we want to brag about or celebrate ?
it has nothing to do with me .
how many since november ?
89 .
wow , grey , that has something to do with you .
don &apos;t kid yourself .
right there .
the swollen ventricles are the clue .
so he doesn &apos;t have alzheimer &apos;s ?
nope .
it &apos;s called normal pressure hydrocephalus , or n.p.h ..
martin had a buildup of cerebrospinal fluid ,
and it placed intense pressure on his brain , as you can see .
the accident caused a tear in the sheath around the spinal cord ,
which released some of this fluid and reduced the pressure .
isn &apos;t the fluid just gonna build up again ?
if we do nothing , yes ,
he &apos;ll go back to the way he was , probably in a matter of hours .
but we &apos;re not gonna do nothing .
the shunt is like a little hose
to keep fluid from building back up again .
then i &apos;ll be okay ?
we &apos;ll want to do some checkups , but ... yes .
you &apos;ll have your husband back .
it &apos;s a miracle .
uh , dr. webber ,
um , the police are asking if now is a good time .
police ? why ? what happened ?
hey . where have you been ?
i don &apos;t know . i just -- i needed some air .
you okay ?
he &apos;s only been alive for two hours ,
and he &apos;s already lost his mom ,
his dad barely survived surgery --
he doesn &apos;t even have a name .
i &apos;m calling him dan .
how are we supposed do this ?
the dead mothers , the motherless babies --
it &apos;s just too freaking hard and sad and messed up .
it sucks , but it &apos;s the job .
really ? really ?
hey , let her go .
come on , don &apos;t you remember what it was like to be a resident
and have all of this death around you ,
be new , terrifying ?
why do you think they care so much about this stupid streak ?
death is scary .
they just want to believe
that there &apos;s somebody out there who can defy it .
geez !
why are you ... lurking in the dark ?
you &apos;re lurking .
i can &apos;t sleep .
i &apos;m wiped .
if you &apos;re gonna keep lurking ,
please don &apos;t stare at me while i sleep .
did you know when arizona cheated on you ,
before she told you ?
what ?
and with george -- did you know it ?
did you have a feeling ?
meredith , what -- what happened ?
i killed a mother -- a pregnant mother .
her baby survived . he &apos;s healthy .
a @-@ and the father is ... stable .
martin , this wasn &apos;t your fault . you weren &apos;t in your right mind .
the police know that .
martin , we have a short window here ,
and it &apos;s closing .
we need to get you up to surgery
if i &apos;m gonna place the shunt in time .
i don &apos;t ...
i don &apos;t think i want it .
mr. davis , without the shunt , you --
i &apos; forget all this . i know .
i &apos;ll forget that i &apos;m a murderer .
no , martin .
martin , you -- think about what you &apos;re saying .
i know you &apos;re upset , but just take a moment , martin .
i don &apos;t need a moment , doc !
marty , don &apos;t . please don &apos;t do this .
i -- i -- i can &apos;t lose you again .
please .
sally . honey .
i don &apos;t remember the last five years .
i lost them .
i come back , i wake up here , to this ?
it &apos;s not my life . it &apos;s not our life .
it &apos;ll never be our life again .
i can &apos;t live with this .
i can &apos;t .
you just let me go . you put me in a home .
don &apos;t look back . you let me rot .
you let me go .
it &apos;s not fair . can &apos;t she just override him ?
martin was very clear . that &apos;s not what he wants .
y-- maybe she can wait
until the fluids build up in his brain again ,
and -- and then she can just make a choice for him .
it &apos;s his decision , warren ,
not his wife &apos;s , not ours .
he &apos;s our patient .
he &apos;s lucid ...
and he &apos;s made his wishes very clear .
now , we may not agree with them , but it &apos;s our job to honor them .
i thought you went home .
no , i was waiting for you .
i can make it home on my own .
i &apos;ve done it lots of times .
stop it , please .
well , stop treating me like some fragile , little --
why wouldn &apos;t you be fragile ?
and why wouldn &apos;t i worry about that ?
it &apos;s been almost two months .
every day , i wake up and remember
and have to fight just to pull my crap together .
so if it &apos;s that hard for me ,
i got to figure it &apos;s way harder for you .
so you know what ? i will watch you .
i will worry about you . i &apos;m not gonna apologize for that .

things are not always what they appear to be .
they &apos;re often an indicator of something bigger going on ,
deep underneath --
symptoms , red flags ,
warning signs ,
things we should pay attention to ,
things we shouldn &apos;t ever ignore ...
i took the first flight . left my keys .

things that could really hurt us ...
