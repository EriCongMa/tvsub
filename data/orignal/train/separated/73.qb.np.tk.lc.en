he could be president .
oh , please , stop .
what ? he &apos;s handsome enough .
he &apos;s certainly tall enough .
oh , peter isn &apos;t even sure if he &apos;s running for governor .
oh , he &apos;ll run for governor .
i don &apos;t know .
he has to decide by next week .
hello , jackie .
alicia .
you have a moment ?
i do .
i haven &apos;t seen you for while , alicia .
how are you ?
why , jackie ? why &apos;d you do it ?
why did i ... do it ?
the house .
the house zach and grace grew up in .
the house i lived in for 13 years .
why did ... i put a down payment on it ?
yes .
i didn &apos;t want to see it go to another family .
you knew i put an offer on it ,
and you didn &apos;t want me to get it .
i @-@ i was visiting a friend in highland park ,
and i saw the &quot; for sale &quot; sign , and ...
i decided to put a down payment on it .
because you just so happened to need a four @-@ bedroom , 3,400 @-@ square @-@ foot @-@ house ?
no , it &apos;s not for me . it &apos;s for peter and the kids .
we struggled for three years , jackie .
we lost our home .
we took zach and grace out of school .
where was all this generosity ...
alicia , i offered you a place in my home ,
i offered you loans ,
and every time you said , &quot; i want to do it on my own . &quot;
well , i don &apos;t have that many years left ,
and i &apos;d like to leave something for my children .
and you &apos;ll live there with them .
what ?
you &apos;re giving peter and the kids the house ,
and you will live there with them .
i don &apos;t know . i @-@ i don &apos;t want to presume .
well , you &apos;re finally getting what you wanted , jackie .
and what is that ?
replacing me .
oh , alicia , i am not replacing you .
you left .
i &apos;m stopping you .
i &apos;m not really sure how you &apos;ll do that .
i &apos;m a lawyer ; watch me .
lindsey ...
megan ...
and pamela .
these three young women
have spent five years in prison , your honor ,
five years , for a murder they did not commit .
excuse me , your honor , that is still unproven .
yes , but what is proven is
that the dna tying these girls to the body was bogus .
again , your honor , an assertion .
yes , but it &apos;s not looking good for you , is it , mr agos ?
this is the fifth case i &apos;ve had through here
due to the malfeasance of the illinois crime lab ,
and i &apos;ve overturned all of them .
but those four cas were built only on dna .
here , there was physical evidence .
the shoe prints of all three of these women
were found in the vicinity of the body .
&apos;cause it was on a trail that they used every day .
and witnesses at the summer camp
testified to them repeatedly bullying ...
rosa torres on the day of her murder , your honor .
it is unfair to discount the totality of that evidence
due to one simple infraction .
&quot; one simple infraction &quot; ?
really ?
the cornerstone of your case was the dna-- the jury was lied to .
not by the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s office
which is why the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s office
should share in our anger at this injustice .
they should be agitating for the immediate release of these women ,
not fighting against it .
okay . thank you , everyone . you can sit down now .
given the egregious nature of these crime lab infractions ,
i have no choice other than to vacate these convictions .
your honor , we would move for an immediate release .
mr. agos , do you intend to proceed on the original charges ?
we do , your honor . and we would oppose bail .
it was denied in the original trial ,
and we see no compelling reason for it to be granted now .
i would agree .
the defendants are held for retrial .
what &apos;s that mean ? i stay inside ?
just for the moment . but this was the big one ,
getting the conviction vacated .
i &apos;m gonna cry .
it &apos;s good , lindsey .
i know ,
it &apos;s just , i don &apos;t think they &apos;ll let me out .
i have this nightmare of this open door .
every time i get close to it , it shuts in my face .
it &apos;s okay .
damn it .
key thing is , we kept them behind bars .
you know what this is , don &apos;t you ?
i &apos;m paying for the sins of the past .
crime lab screws up under childs ...
i have to pay the price .
do we retry ?
they bullied and killed that girl .
not only that ,
i promised the torres family
that i wouldn &apos;t let the killers of their daughter go unpunished .
judge romano seems to be leaning against this .
it &apos;s crime lab fatigue .
offer them an alford plea .
但承认有足够的证据证明其有罪
i &apos;ve got to get this off our ledger .
hello ...
yeah . hold on . cary .
everybody has to sign on though .
if that &apos;s what you want .
hey , alicia , what &apos;s up ?
what ?
she said she bought the house for you and the kids .
she said what ?
this is the first i &apos;ve heard of it .
it &apos;s not that i don &apos;t want you in there , peter ,
it &apos;s just weird being separated
and having the kids wanting to be in the house with you
while i &apos;m on the outs .
yeah .
but ... y @-@ you were thinking of buying the house , too , right ?
well , yeah , because of this condo conversion .
yeah , but then it would &apos;ve been
you in the house with the kids and me on the outs .
um ... you &apos;re right .
i @-@ i &apos;m sorry , we should &apos;ve talked .
okay . well ...
don &apos;t worry , i will speak to jackie .
thank you .
must be odd
working in the same town as your husband .
nope , it isn &apos;t .
what can i help you with , mr. kresteva ?
mike . nice kids .
thanks , mike
eh , it &apos;s just , how do you handle it ,
fighting criminal cases when your husbans on the other side ?
with great delicacy .
i like you , alicia .
you have wit .
thank you .
i didn &apos;t think it ended so well the last time we spoke , mike .
so what is it that you need ?
i thought it ended pretty well .
i never try to make enemies .
whenever i disagre with someone i think :
today i can &apos;t see their side ,
but tomorrow , who knows ?
so y @-@ you see my side ?
well , i &apos;ve come to present you with the report
from our blue ribbon panel .
i recused myself .
yes , but we &apos;ve changed our conclusions .
you convinced us .
we censure the officers for not announcing themselves ,
shooting an unarmed man ,
and possibly even placing a drop gun in his hand .
to cover their tracks .
and it also censures my husband for covering it up ?
well ... yes .
truth is truth , isn &apos;it ?
you wouldn &apos;t have us compromise the truth
out of some misplaced deference to family connections ?
no . so then you understand why i have to recuse myself .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m here .
i &apos;m offering you a chance to write a minority report .
and what would that say ?
whatever you want . whatever your conscience guides you to say .
i think i &apos;ll decline .
mrs. florrick , i know you don &apos;t trust me ,
but i &apos;ve come around to your side .
all tyranny needs to gain a foothold
is for people of good conscience to remain silent ,
so ... don &apos;t remain silent .
michael ?
hello . how are you ?
i &apos;m good , diane .
you look great .
you , too .
now , don &apos;t you dare think about poaching alicia .
we &apos;ve got our hooks into her .
actually , i was here to poacho you . ha !
alicia just asked me in to discuss our blue ribbon panel .
really ? well , i hope that all works out .
i &apos;m sure it will .
anyway , alicia , thank you .
it was most helpful .
and thank you , diane ,
for putting alicia on the panel .
well ... odd that .
yes .
so , uh , cary called , and we have an alford plea .
really ?
yes .
my guess is they &apos;re worried about a lawsuit .
lindsey will need some hand @-@ holding .
we don &apos;t want her to take it ?
oh , no , we just ...
want her to know all the facts .
so , what do i do ?
don &apos;t sleep with other people .
and that will get me elected ?
i &apos;d vote for you .
here &apos;s how people will elect you as illinoi senator .
you &apos;re a woman .
thank you .
there are three other men in the race .
they will split the male vote .
you will win the female vote ,
but ... only if you win the female vote .
meaning ... ?
female voters are traditional .
they don &apos;t like a modern woman .
and that &apos;s why you &apos;re going to stand beside me ,
and by your woman ?
vanessa , that is not what i was saying .
but it &apos;s the point , isn &apos;t it ?
having my ex @-@ husband approving of me
makes me more traditional .
vanessa .
what ?
i &apos;m not saying we have to mean it .
i &apos;m talking about politics .
just politics ?
yes .
what else is there ?
i don &apos;t know .
you tell me .
a what ?
an alford plea .
it &apos;s a form a ...
a guilty plea .
no .
wait , just ... just hear us .
i already said ...
lindsey , listen .
we &apos;ll do whatever you want ,
but with an alford plea ,
you get out .
you acknowledge to the prosecution
that they have enough evidence to convict ,
but you get out .
do they ?
have enough evidence to convict ?
wiout the dna , normally we would say no ,
but you never know for sure what a jury will do .
so if i take this ... plea ...
the state &apos;s attorney agrees to a sentence of time served .
you go free . now . immediately .
really ?
yeah , megan , but there are drawbacks .
you won &apos;t be able to clear your name .
you &apos;ll be a convicted felon for the rest of your life .
and one parole violation , and you &apos;re right back here .
but if i don &apos;t take it , i have to stay here ?
yes . at least until you get a new trial .
and that &apos;s how long ?
i don &apos;t know .
i want you to have a complete picture here , pamela .
the state &apos;s attorney offers this plea
because they are afraid of being sued .
as part of the plea agreement , you have to promise not to sue .
but get out ?
yes . that &apos;s why they do it .
they dingle freedom in front of your eyes to get a guilty plea .
and if i turned down and sued ?
the last crime lab lawsuit against cook county
resulted in a $ 10 million reward .
$ 10 million ?
that &apos;s ...
not a guarantee .
and any award you would get , you would have to split three ways .
do you think i should reject this plea ?
no . we &apos;re just laying out the options .
we have a very good case
against the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s office .
we won a lawsuit last year
on exactly these kind of crime lab missteps .
and it &apos;s important to hold these people responsible .
but ...
we &apos;re not the ones who have to sit in prison for another year .
you have no idea what that kind of money would mean .
my family ...
it would change everything for us .
i guess the question , then , is ...
is it worth it to spend another year in prison
to maybe change everything ?
more or less .
and how long do i have to decide ?
72 hours .
what would you do ?
i have no idea .
so , what do you think ?
i think she needs the money .
who doesn &apos;t ?
a recently released report from an independent police review authority
has found evidence of a cover-
meant to protect a chicago police officer .
this panel investigated the controversial shooting
of an unarmed man on chicago &apos;s el train .
this report ,
exhaustively investigated
by a prestigious blue ribbon panel
that even included the wife of the state &apos;s attorney himself ,
has found a cover @-@ up by local officials ,
including the state &apos;s attorney .
kresteva also dropped a bombshell
that should complicate the ongoing illinois political scene .
i am running for governor of the great state of illinois .
together , we need to stop corruption like this .
we need to stop people like the state &apos;s attorney
from covering up police shootings like this one .
what &apos;s wrong ?
everything .
i was never the best father or husband
or person , really .
but then something happened to me .
my son was diagnosed
as having acute lymphoblastic leukemia ,
and i just woke up ,
like paul on the road to damascus ,
except i was at a bears tailgater
stripped down to my underwear .
damn it . damn it .
what &apos;s wrong ?
i just didn &apos;t see something coming .
have you seen my shoe ?
it &apos;s on your foot .
yeah , the other one .
who &apos;s that ?
the competition .
my competition ?
no , peter &apos;s .
peter &apos;s .
you &apos;re thinking about him , aren &apos;t you .
you &apos;re in bed with me ,
but you &apos;re thinking about him .
you &apos;re joking , right ?
that was a joke ?
come here .
no , i need my shoe .
eli , come here .
oh , my god , look at this , ten messages .
he &apos;s been trying to reach me all morning .
come over here .
you &apos;re referring to peter florrick ,
the state &apos;s attorney ?
this was a mistake , wasn &apos;t it ?
yes .
now go off to your peter .
not without my sh ...
our first date .
now that would be bad enough ,
yeah , this was a mistake .
but then something else happened .
the wife of the state &apos;s attorney ,
alicia florrick , asked me into her office
and told me if i changed this report
and exonerated her husband , that she would sign too .
damn it . damn it !
so , we only get the alford plea
if we all agree .
so , where are we ?
pamela wants to hold out for a civil suit .
oh , i &apos;m sure she does after your sales job .
excuse me , are you accusing me ?
it &apos;s money to you .
it &apos;s a potential $ 10 million law suit ,
and you get 20 % of that .
you can &apos;t get 20 % of freedom .
okay , let &apos;s keep it civil . tommy ?
megan wants to take the plea .
she was beaten up in prison yesterday .
so , here we go with the emotional blackmail .
no , it &apos;s not blackmail . i &apos;m just telling you the facts .
shs being targeted in prison .
and this talk of a civil suit &apos;s just making it worse .
what about your client .
lindsey hasn &apos;t made up her mind yet .
she doesn &apos;t want to admit to something she didn &apos;t do .
exactly .
but she doesn &apos;t want to spend the rest of her life in prison , either .
look , we all know this case is a slam dunk .
the only reason the state attorny is even offering us the alford plea
is because he &apos;s on the run .
you &apos;re married to him , right ? then tell us .
i can &apos;t speak to that .
well , none of us can .
we all know of cases which seemed like slam dunks
and turned out not to be .
okay , so we have three days to figure out whether we have a slam dunk .
i agree .
our clients are looking for assessment of their chances ,
and the prosecution is using our dissention against us .
so let &apos;s use this remaining time to see what case we have , okay ?
you &apos;re on it , right ?
yeah , i put a call into the medical examiner &apos;s office .
oh , and , um ,
kalinda , can i hire you to look into something for me ?
sure , what is it ? just a ...
i think there might be something wrong in a financial arrangement .
okay , sure , whose ?
i will need to know .
my mother @-@ in @-@ law &apos;s .
hey , bum .
callie .
what are you up to here ?
the slumber camp murder ?
yeah , we &apos;re trying to win them some money ,
but what happened to kids today ? they don &apos;t want money .
they want freedom .
you look good suspended .
yep . you got any pointers ?
don &apos;t get rusty .
you &apos;ve been suspended , what , six months , right ?
yep .
i was a year .
addiction . cocaine use .
i didn &apos;t know that .
yeah , some of my best summations were done high .
but don &apos;t i seem calmer these days ?
you do .
so , what are you doing ?
i &apos;m reading a book i wrote .
how is it ?
not good .
oh , sorry .
no , it &apos;s just one more thing i know i can &apos;t do .
i have something you might be interested in .
behind the bar .
it &apos;s a support group for sanctioned lawyers .
disbarment , suspension , drugs ...
sounds exciting .
oh , come on , what are you doing anyway ?
just lying around all day ?
didn &apos;t we almost go out on a date three years ago ?
yeah , you stood me up
i was in rehab .
so , we &apos;ll make this our date .
come on .
what are you doing tomorrow night ?
kalinda , where you been ?
oh , hibernating .
you guys haven &apos;t been too forthcoming lately .
yeah , well.that &apos;s all changing .
we &apos;re all loosening up around here .
really ? why &apos;s that ?
i don &apos;t know , but , uh , your name is no longer dirt .
no , no , no , no , no , no .
into the lab .
no , that way .
what do you need ?
summer camp killing , 2007 .
three girl killers .
oh , yeah , that one . i thought that was getting kicked .
yeah , state &apos;s attorney &apos;s office is considering retrying .
ah , yes , dead horse beaten yet again .
come on .
uh , 16 @-@ year @-@ old girl .
three other girls brought her into the woods .
they stabbed her eight times ,
slashed her carotid .
weapon was never found .
ah , ooh , and look at this .
what ?
a note for you .
asa agos , he &apos;s , uh , one step ahead of you .
-凯里
mm , for the moment .
oh , she was found without her clothes ?
yeah , they thought rape at first--
cops always think rape--
but no semen , no penetration , so they thought
the killer stripped her down to make it look like a rape .
what &apos;s this ?
hypostasis .
lividity caused by the blood after the death .
no , this .
i don &apos;t know .
but no lividy there .
probably something in contact with her body ,
something on the ground .
no .
it &apos;s on the other side of the ankle , too .
oh , my god , you &apos;re right .
you solved it .
alicia florrick askesd me into her office
and told me if i changed this report
and exonerated her husband that she would ...
it &apos;s a lie , eli ; he &apos;s lying .
so , you weren &apos;t on this blue ribbon panel ?
no , i was , but i ...
so , you didn &apos;t meet with him ?
i met with him
i mean , he met with me .
he came here , but he came here
to ask me if i wand to write a minority report , and i said no .
so , all that staff about peter trying to cover up a shooting ,
that &apos;s not true ?
unfortunately , i can &apos;t
say anything about those proceedings because they were confidential .
okay , so that &apos;s it .
wait , eli , you have to put out a statement or something .
saying what ?
saying that it &apos;s not true .
i @-@ i didn &apos;t ask him to stop the report .
why would we do that .
because he &apos;s lying , eli .
alicia ,
people lie , and politicians are just people .
the problem is when you run around putting out statements
saying that people lied ,
it just brings more attention to the lie .
people think there &apos;s something wrong with you
for making such a fuss about it .
people think you lied
because you &apos;re making a fuss about a lie .
that &apos;s crazy .
it &apos;s a 24 @-@ hour news story .
it &apos;ll go away unless we take the bait .
but it &apos;s ...
it makes me look bad , and @-@ and he gets away with it ?
yep .
you have to let it go , alicia .
it &apos;s the big leagues .
you file a few off .
it &apos;s a bicycle clip .
you wear it on your ankle to keep your pants
from getting caught in the bike chain .
which one is this for , my mother @-@ in @-@ law ?
the victim &apos;s body .
something was oppressed against her ankles when she was murdered .
here and here ; that &apos;s why there was no lividity .
but there &apos;s nothing in the police report
that says she was riding a bike that night .
i know .
and yet ...
so , where was she riding it ?
a bicycle ?
there was a chance that rosa rode a bicycle
that night just before she was killed .
but she didn &apos;t have a bike .
i mean , we weren &apos;t allowed to bring anything .
they didn &apos;t want any of us off grounds .
what about the counselors ?
mary jane had a bike .
the counselor in rosa &apos;s cabin , she had a mountain bike .
she was always going off riding .
good , thanks . that &apos;s helpful .
wait .
what about the plea ?
what are pamela and megan gonna do ?
oh , yes .
pamela doesn &apos;t want to take the alford plea ,
but megan does .
megan &apos;s being beaten up in prison .
oh , my god , i &apos;m so sorry .
maybe i should take the plea .
here &apos;s what we &apos;re trying to do , lindsey .
we want to line up the evidence to demonstrate to judge romano
that the state &apos;s attorney has no evidence to hold you to trial .
they &apos;re merely trying to neutralize a civil suit .
if we &apos;re successful , you won &apos;t have to plead guilty .
you &apos;ll just be released .
but you have to do that before the plea expires ?
yes , that &apos;s why we &apos;re pursuing this evidence .
okay , and you want me to sit tight ?
yes , just for a little while longer .
then i will .
tell megan to stay strong .
thank you , alicia .
you still having nightmares ?
no .
so , we have evidence that
the victim , rosa torres , might have ridden a bike
the night she was killed .
i understand that , uh , you had a bike , right ?
yeah . why ?
and you reported it stolen ?
but then you found it , right ?
yeah , a week later . why ?
uh , rosa borrowed it that night , intending to return it ,
but then , she was murdered .
how do you know all this ?
where did you find it ?
what does it matter ?
well , it matters , because lindsey is innocent ,
and my guess is , rosa borrowed your bike that night
to meet someone off the grounds ,
and he or she moved her body back onto the grounds ,
but never knew about the bike .
so , where &apos;d you find it ?
i want complete separation between the legal and the political .
anyway , i think you all get it ,
and with that i need a moment .
alicia , good to see you .
i &apos;m sorry i didn &apos;t say anything about my press conference yesterday .
i didn &apos;t want to let my campaign get in the way of the panel .
so , i invited you to my office ?
you ...
excuse me ?
you said , i invited you to my ofce ,
and tried to get you to change the report about peter ?
yes .
which is a lie .
which part ?
all of it .
first of all , do you want some water , or something to drink ?
no .
and second of all , i &apos;m not ... i &apos;m not sure what you &apos;re disagreeing about .
i &apos;m not disagreeing about anything .
i &apos;m telling you to stop lying about me .
alicia , i &apos;m not lying about anything .
you invited me into your office .
no , i didn &apos;t .
you came to my office .
because you invited me .
and then you asked me to change the report .
no . you came to my office ,
and you asked me if i wanted to write a minority report .
alicia , uh ... i &apos;m sorry . i ...
our memories seem to diverge here .
you invited me into your office ,
and i was stunned when you asked me to change the report .
i asked you if this was covered by confidentiality .
you said , &quot; no . &quot;
otherwise , i never would have mentioned it in my press conference .
what are you talking about ?
you &apos;re lying !
no . i &apos;m not .
how can you pretend that isn &apos;t what happened ?
one second , ginger . i &apos;ll be right out .
you &apos;re gonna lose .
i am ? to whom ?
peter .
no . you know why i won &apos;t ?
because he isn &apos;t gonna enter the race .
he &apos;s too smart . he knows he &apos;s vulnerable .
stop ... lying about me .
alicia ...
don &apos;t pretend what i &apos;m saying isn &apos;t the truth .
i know a lie can travel halfway around the world
while the truth is putting its shoes on .
but still ...
i found it here ,
a week later just leaning there against a tree .
chain broken .
who lives here ?
some people who work in town .
and counselors
a few .
hi , i &apos;m so sorry to bother you .
i was thinking of sending my daughter
to the summer camp up the road .
do you think it &apos;s a good ... ?
hi . uh , my name is kalinda ,
and i was thinking of working as a counselor ...
hi . uh , i was just in the neighborhood ,
and working as an investigator for a reality tv show ,
looking into the slumber camp murder .
really ? i worked at the camp then .
really ?
yeah , rosa was a great girl .
that was a tragedy , what happened .
yeah . must have been tough .
were you guys close ?
thanks
no , just , um ... just the usual
instructor @-@ camper relationip .
you ran a photography program ?
yeah .
i also taught at the community college
before everything went digital .
there was an art form to film .
now everybody just worries about computer bytes .
nobody cares about process anymore .
i loved working at that camp , though .
those kids inspire me .
in @-@ in what way ?
mm , their reverence for nature .
there &apos;s not a lot of reverence anymore .
there she is .
there &apos;s rosa .
nice girl .
i don &apos;t know . he hasn &apos;t decided yet .
which way he &apos;s leaning ?
well , to be honest , peter is leaning
against running for governor .
why ?
he feels the democratic committee is yanking him around .
they promise him a speech at convention ,
then they back down .
it doesn &apos;t help that kresteva has declared .
he &apos;s pretty popular , you know .
i spoke to him .
you ... when ?
today .
you spoke to him about lying . didn &apos;t you ?
you couldn &apos;t help yourself .
and he said , he wasn &apos;t lying , but you misremembered , right ?
yes .
alicia , i am good at my job .
i know what people do .
so when i say , don &apos;t speak to them again ,
please believe me , i know what i speak of .
peter should run .
i know .
he needs your help .
以喜欢昂贵领带而著称
kresteva is dangerous . he &apos;s like blagojevich dangerous .
stop selling , eli . quit while you &apos;re ahead .
okay .
i &apos;m ahead ?
you tell me what you need , and i will think about it .
no kids .
i know .
and there it is .
you didn &apos;t have to say that , alicia .
i know .
i &apos;m not sure if i &apos;m running .
yes . that &apos;s what eli said .
well , kresteva &apos;s no worse than most .
i &apos;m not sure i agree , but either way ,
this isn &apos;t about him .
it &apos;s about you wanting to see me elected ?
peter , we have had our ... issues ,
but i &apos;ve always respected you political abilities .
and i &apos;ve always thought you re better in office than ...
the alternative .
you know , to be honest , alicia ,
i &apos;m finally enjoying what i &apos;m doing here .
maybe that &apos;s why i &apos;m thinking of not running .
okay ... if that &apos;s the reason .
hey . your support means a lot to me .
run , peter .
you &apos;d be a good governor .
that &apos;s when i found out i was disbarred .
i &apos;ve worked ... i worked my life to become a lawyer .
it was everything to me .
this was fun .
there are usually more people .
yup , that &apos;s all this needs .
you know , one of the dangers of not having the law to fall back on ?
coming here with you ?
distractions .
drugs , alcohol , gambling .
anonymous sex with strangers .
it &apos;s a good thing we &apos;re not strangers .
i could prend to be a stranger .
my apartment is ten minutes from here .
i &apos;ll leave first .
if we left ,
he &apos;d be alone .
my address .
mom , how are you ?
good .
oh , i love seeing you here .
seems so ... appropriate .
don &apos;t buy the house , mom .
oh , she talked to you ?
yes , alicia talked to me .
she doesn &apos;t understand .
she thinks i &apos;m doing this to hurt her .
i &apos;m doing this for you and the kids .
i know , and thank you .
now , don &apos;t buy the house .
you know , she wants to buy it .
she wants to live there without you .
mom , it &apos;s not your house .
i put down payment on it .
i &apos;ll lose that .
no , you &apos;ll lose the earnest money at the most .
i can &apos;t afford losing that .
yes , you can . you &apos;ll be fine .
peter , i love you .
you have a good heart , but
you don &apos;t know when people are manipulating you . i do .
alicia is manipulating you .
alicia and i are trying very hard to act like adults .
i need you to butt out .
peter , i @-@ i can &apos;t believe it .
no , listen to me . sit down . listen to me .
do not buy that house .
do you understand me ?
peter , she &apos;s controlling you .
mother !
do you want me in your life ?
yes or no ?
yes .
then stop it .
stop it right now !
call the seller tomorrow , or i will .
do you understand me ?
good .
thanks for coming in .
you think he was having a sexual rationship with her ?
i checked his record .
two years after the murder ,
another camper accused him of sexual harassment .
so you &apos;re saying , rosa took mary jane &apos;s bike
and rode it to this counselor &apos;s house ?
yeah . justin varney , but no one ever knew ,
because the body was found in the woods back near her cabin .
the killer must have dumped it t .
why would he kill her ?
accusations of criminal sexual abuse .
she was 16 , he was 25 .
so , call an emergency hearing , ask for
a reconsideration on bail .
it &apos;s worth a shot .
okay .
i &apos;ll prepare the motion . mm .
no . you take it head @-@ on .
we had problems in our marriage ,
but we &apos;ve worked hard to mend fences .
mend fences ?
do you have a better cliche ?
just a second .
hey , frank . what &apos;s up ?
you tell me .
you saw mike kresteva announce for governor .
i did .
is peter running against him ?
is the democratic committee supporting him ?
you come out for peter , he &apos;ll run .
is that your ex @-@ wife ?
yes . vanessa .
and she &apos;s running for state senate ?
yes .
and you are runnig her campaign ?
consulting . i can do both at the same time ; don &apos;worry .
and what if you can &apos;t ?
what &apos;s up , frank ?
we don &apos;t want her to run .
what about robert mulvey for state senator ?
don &apos;t do this to me , please .
she jumped the line , eli .
we don &apos;t want a woman in the race .
mulvey wins the women &apos;s vote without her ...
then let mulvey compete .
no .
that &apos;s not how this works .
he loses the women &apos;s vote , he loses .
you want us to help peter ,
you drop out of your ex @-@ wife &apos;s campaign .
this is crazy .
no , it &apos;s not .
i can &apos;t do that to her .
yes , you can .
she can run in four years ; help her then .
damn it !
uh ... don &apos;t go getting melodramatic on me , eli .
you don &apos;t care about the state race .
peter &apos;s the ball game .
just tell her you can &apos;t help wh her campaign .
good to see you , eli .
职业 : 摄影师
and what do we have today , counselors ?
they &apos;re here because , your honor
my client and her co @-@ defendants don &apos;t have the luxury of waiting for a trial .
hey , justin varney has an alibi .
he was at a bar with some friends
at the time of the murder .
the timeline could be off ?
yeah , but there &apos;s something else .
that &apos;s a friendship bracelet , the kind teenage girls
give to their boyfriends and keep one for themselves .
and that is megan .
megan gave justin her friendship bracele
justin didn &apos;t do it .
he was dating girls from the camp ,
but he wasn &apos;t at home the night of the murder .
rosa went there to see him , and ...
megan was jealous .
yeah , and megan laid in wait for her .
is cary anywhere near this ?
not yet , but i wouldn &apos;t chance it .
and our client ?
i don &apos;t know ,
i think the only one involved is megan , but ...
their fates are tied .
uh , okay , go show it to diane .
and thanks for the help with my mother @-@ in @-@ law .
yes , jackie . the money for the down payment ,
you borrowed it from zach and grace &apos;s trust ,
and that is ...
what ?
i had a stroke .
you ... oh , come on , jackie .
alicia , i can &apos;t reach peter
please , you need to call him .
i &apos;m in the hospital .
and here we are .
yep , here we are .
have you decided ?
no private lives .
mafia rules ?
we can come after each other but not the families .
nope .
peter , sorry , my one play here is ...
sorry , guys , can you grab the next one ?
thanks .
my one play here is to keep you out of the race .
and how do you keep an ambitious man from running ?
tell him you &apos;ll go after his family
with everything you got .
you &apos;re a real piece of work , aren &apos;t you ?
i try to be .
well , i &apos;m gonna come after you
with everything i &apos;ve got , everything i can find .
sure .
why not .
peter , you enter the race , i can promise you one thing :
you may not regret it , but your wife will .
oh , and ... your phone &apos;s ringing .
hi , alicia .
what ?
i forgive you .
is she all right ?
i don &apos;t know .
mom , i &apos;m sorry , i &apos;m sorry i yelled at you .
it &apos;s gonna be all right .
i &apos;m sorry ?
really ?
i thought i could handle two campaigns at once ,
but i just don &apos;t have the bandwidth to do either well .
so you chose him .
i chose the campaign i was managing not consulting .
i &apos;m sorry .
this is because we slept together , isn &apos;t it ?
no .
i don &apos;t believe you .
look , vanessa , it pains me to do this .
well , i &apos;m so sorry for your pain !
look , i just ...
what ?
i just hope that we can still be friends , because ..
this has been nice .
good @-@ bye , eli .
okay , run this by me again .
hypothetically ...
of course .
if i could convince you
that one of the codefendants was actually guilty but
the other two weren &apos;t ...
that &apos;s a big if .
would you drop the charges against the other two ?
alicia , it &apos;s not my call to make .
i still have a job to protect here .
for the time being , at least .
but i thought you liked the--what did you call it ?
clarity .
well , let &apos;s just say it &apos;s getting murkier by the day .
i &apos;m sorry , alicia , honestly .
you don &apos;t seem happy here , cary .
really ?
here in my cubicle ?
got my family circus cartoons and my ficus .
what more could i want ?
i &apos;ll talk to you .
yeah .
peter , it &apos;s time to do this .
it &apos;s time to decide .
yeah , i know .
which way are you going ?
let &apos;s do it .
good .
we &apos;ll win this .
i don &apos;t know about that , but ...
it &apos;s been decided .
no .
callie ,
all our clients are gonna sit in jail for other year ,
while the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s office devotes every resource they have
to figuring out how to prove them guilty .
do you really think they &apos;re not gonna find this ?
it &apos;s not about what i think , diane--
my client has made up her mind .
then your client needs to be told the facts .
this evidence against megan looks equally bad for all of us .
there &apos;s no way to prove that lindsey and pam
didn &apos;t help megan do this .
we &apos;ll take our chances .
no . you want the money from a lawsuit--
that &apos;s why you &apos;ll take your chances .
oh , grow up .
don &apos;t play the martyr here .
you were just as much into the money as i was .
and what if ... lindsey testifies against your client ?
what ?
it &apos;s a new trial .
cary needs new witnesses to replace the dna evidence .
lindsey would make a good witness .
she &apos;d lie ?
she wants out of prisons ; she &apos;s desperate .
you never know what a desperate person will say .
so i &apos;m wrong to want money ,
but you are not wrong to blackmail ?
that &apos;s right .
how &apos;s that door looking ?
within reach .
you have any idea what you &apos;re gonna do ?
no .
i used to like volleyball .
i wouldn &apos;t mind playing some volleyball .
this is where the nightmare always ended .
lindsey .
oh , my baby !
it &apos;s over . oh , sweetheart !
we &apos;ve had it for far too long in the state of illinois .
it &apos;s the politics of divisiveness and discord ,
personal attacks instead of public achievement ,
negative campaigning instead of positive creation .
and that is why today
i am throwing my cap into the race
and announcing my candidacy for the governor of illinois .
