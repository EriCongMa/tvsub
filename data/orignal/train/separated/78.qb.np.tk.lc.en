your firm is representing bishop , the drug dealer .
we only handle his legitimate business .
i don &apos;t like the fbi coming to me .
we &apos;re taking care of it .
i am thinking about contributing to your campaign .
really ?
i like your wife .
i &apos;m new to town ,
and the government is putting out an rfp
to outsource its tow truck service ,
but they won &apos;t let me bid .
he &apos;s my husband .
is he dangerous , your husband ?
i don &apos;t know .
dad .
yeah . i got your lunch .
you hear anything ?
about what ?
damien &apos;s mom . did she call ?
don &apos;t worry . she &apos;ll call .
did you get the bounce house ?
i got the bounce house .
now go learn to break a brick with your forehead , hmm ?
love you , dad .
yeah ?
thanks .
jackie .
jackie .
what ?
are you okay ?
alicia , hi .
i &apos;ve been looking all over for you .
maddie .
this is jackie florrick .
it &apos;s very nice to finally meet you , mrs. florrick .
why , thank you . and you are ... ?
the money .
then the pleasure is all mine .
do you mind if i steal your daughter @-@ in @-@ law ?
there &apos;s some people i &apos;d like to introduce her to .
alicia &apos;s the belle of the ball .
be my guest .
oh . just one sec , maddie .
belle of the ball ?
hi , diane .
did you ... ?
where ?
3434 lakeview .
i &apos;m sorry to do this to you , but he requested us .
no , that &apos;s all right . um , i &apos;ll be right there .
okay .
you have to take off ?
work .
are we still on for drinks later ?
i wouldn &apos;t miss it .
great .
and if i were you , jimmy v. ,
i would take a breath before i posted anything actionable .
is that your quote ?
what &apos;s the blog ?
pooranarchy.com. all one word .
never heard of it .
you will .
in about one hour because that &apos;s when i &apos;m posting
that a national news magazine is sitting on a story
accusing peter florrick of sleeping with a campaign worker .
okay , give me your number ; i &apos;ll get a quote from the candidate .
hang on .
come here .
okay .
yep .
okay . i &apos;ll call you back .
where &apos;s the candidate ?
take it off ! come on !
where &apos;s the candidate ?
i &apos;m here for mr. bishop .
i &apos;m alicia florrick . lockhart &amp; gardner .
oh , yeah .
lesli rand . cutner &amp; paradini .
ah , you &apos;re mr. bishop &apos;s other law firm .
his primary law firm , yeah .
i didn &apos;t realize he had a primary law firm .
are we gonna be enemies ?
depends .
you &apos;re the lawyers .
why am i telling you this ?
i &apos;m not hearing anything about an arrest , lemond .
we overreact , we set something in motion .
and we underreact and i end up in prison .
what do you think ?
who called you about the arrest ?
my accounting firm .
i had an appointment , and they cancelled ,
saying my accountant , mr. stiglitz ,
had been arrested at his home .
was there any search warrant served at his office ?
no . they would have said .
good .
so at least they don &apos;t have any of his work product .
i &apos;ll have our lawyers cover state and federal bond court .
well , unfortunately , bond hearings take place
the day after an arrest ,
so if there &apos;s anything to worry about , then ...
that &apos;s too late .
meaning my accountant makes a deal .
yes .
we &apos;ve got friends among the cops .
we &apos;ll know something in a few hours .
good .
and since this is probably a drug @-@ related issue ,
do you want us to help cutner &amp; paradini
look through their legal work ?
we &apos;re fine . thank you .
god . i &apos;m surrounded by women .
look , this is why i pay you two law firms a lot of money .
lesli , your job is to keep me and my crew out of jail .
diane , you watch over my legit businesses .
so show your value .
work together and find out why my accountant was arrested ,
and whether i &apos;ll be .
how &apos;s bankruptcy , diane ?
heard you were having rico troubles , lesli .
will , you there ?
yeah , we &apos;re here with bishop .
alicia , dial in too .
we need to get kalinda on this .
yeah , we &apos;re trying to get people in on a saturday .
good . it &apos;s probably the drug business ,
but he wants us to check for issues on the legit side , too .
the dry cleaning ,
the bakeries , the everything .
there &apos;s also an opportunity here .
i know . i sowed some seeds .
his legitimate business brings in what ?
five million a year to us ?
drug business brings in 20 . maybe more .
i thought we wanted to stay away from drugs .
ideally .
but we &apos;re in a tough time .
if we don &apos;t go after cutner &amp; paradini &apos;s business ,
they &apos;ll come after ours .
okay .
we &apos;ll stay in touch .
a possible client ?
yes .
a drug dealer .
we &apos;ve always resisted his illegal business until now .
why ?
drugs are tricky .
you &apos;re more in the public eye .
you &apos;re on the cops &apos; radar .
and your other clients might leave .
no . money respects money .
even more so in a bad economy .
yep . no , she &apos;s out . what do you need , eli ?
i need a ...
uh , when does diane get back ?
not till tonight . what &apos;s the problem ?
i need you to call a blogger
and intimidate him with a cease @-@ and @-@ desist order .
cease and desist from what ?
well , i ...
a story we don &apos;t want out .
what story ?
eli , i can &apos;t do it unless you tell me the story .
peter slept with a campaign worker .
it &apos;s not true .
and a national news magazine decided not to print the story ,
but now this blogger ... jimmy v. ,
wants to do a post about them not printing the story .
okay . what &apos;s his number ?
uh , hold on .
diane and alicia are trying to get a hold of you .
all right . i &apos;ll give them a call .
this is alicia florrick . please leave a message .
kalinda .
i need you in this .
in what ?
it &apos;s the tow truck thing .
this @-@ this guy clearly doesn &apos;t get the concept of a weekend .
he &apos;s been asking about you to try and find out about your vetting .
um , cary ...
what ?
nothing . let &apos;s ... let &apos;s do it .
kalinda , this is nick saverese .
hi .
and gavin wells .
so you &apos;re the one who vetted me .
i am .
kalinda ...
may i ... call you kalinda ?
of course .
so , kalinda ...
he wants me to split this deal with him 50 @-@ 50
and i was just wondering , well , what do you think to that ?
it &apos;s not a deal till you win the bid .
and you don &apos;t win the government bid without me .
yeah , but ...
you &apos;re not doing anything , are you ?
i &apos;m putting up the trucks , the drivers .
what are you doing ?
being black .
well , he helps you with your , uh , your criminal past .
that &apos;s what he contributes .
she &apos;s right .
with your past felony conviction ,
i &apos;m the only reason you &apos;re in the game bidding at all .
yeah .
just let me see if i got this .
you think i should move my business to chicago
and incorporate with him ?
hi , uh ...
would you just hold on one sec ?
mr. sav ... savre ...
okay , just call me nick .
nick .
um , you came to us to vet your options ,
and we did .
we suggested mr. wells , a highly respected businessman
who , due to his status as a minority @-@ owned business
offers you an advantage in the bidding process .
that &apos;s all .
beyond that , um ...
you can do what you want .
please excuse me .
welcome to chicago .
now pay up .
good . i &apos;ll , uh , i &apos;ll check with the accountant &apos;s wife ,
see what she knows .
no , he &apos;s just being a nuisance .
oh , by the way ...
i didn &apos;t tell cary that he was my husband .
it &apos;s just ... complicated .
okay .
i &apos;m heading out now .
so i &apos;m being a nuisance , am i ?
yeah , you are .
who was that on the phone ?
your lesbian girlfriend ?
lana the lesbian fed .
do you know they charge you every time you come here ?
cary gets $ 400 an hour , and i get $ 175 .
wouldn &apos;t it be cheaper if you just gave me a call ?
so your lesbian girlfriend .
she knows that you &apos;re married ?
she &apos;s okay with that ?
nick ...
i have to get to work .
come on , you know me .
i @-@ i don &apos;t mind you working .
you know , i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m open @-@ minded that way ,
but ... i don &apos;t know .
i do mind you sleeping with other women .
i mean , call me old @-@ fashioned .
you &apos;re such an idiot .
that wasn &apos;t even lana on the phone .
it was work .
your voice on that phone was not work .
kalinda .
everything all right ?
yeah .
yeah , it is . sorry .
we &apos;re just having a bit of a disagreement .
kalinda here says that you &apos;re $ 400 an hour ,
and i say you &apos;re $ 450 .
and , uh , i don &apos;t know .
which one is it ?
i don &apos;t know . i don &apos;t read the bills .
kalinda , you good ?
we &apos;re okay .
i &apos;m gonna head out now , so i &apos;ll see you later .
bye .
yeah , see you .
you know what ?
she &apos;s convinced me .
let &apos;s sign that contract with the black guy .
speak .
what ? you &apos;re kidding .
i &apos;m afraid not , mr. v.
it &apos;s called &quot; defamation . &quot;
and you defame my client , peter florrick ,
and we &apos;re more than ready to sue .
so , what do i need to do ?
don &apos;t post . if you do ,
we &apos;re gonna sue you for $ 3 million .
but it &apos;s true , the story was written , and they &apos;re not gonna print it .
you don &apos;t know that , mr. v.
all you know is what was said to you .
and since you &apos;ve done no fact @-@ checking ,
you &apos;re open to a suit .
okay . send me the cease @-@ and @-@ desist order , and i won &apos;t post .
you post , and you lose everything you own .
i know . send me the cease @-@ and @-@ desist .
eli , he &apos;s playing you .
he &apos;s gonna print it either way .
i talked to mrs. stiglitz , your accountant &apos;s wife .
the feds had a search warrant ,
and they took all of his accounting files from his home .
it &apos;s okay . i &apos;ll see if anyone on your crew is talking .
the feds don &apos;t just get it in their heads like that to go digging .
it &apos;s not about your drug business .
it &apos;s about your legit businesses .
oh , that &apos;s interesting .
they took all files from all 20 of your legit businesses
so we don &apos;t know which one is a target .
so , diane , do you need help going through your legal work ?
stop it .
my guess is they &apos;re looking at some small oversight
in one of my gas stations or health clubs to arrest me .
find out what .
and i want you .
yes .
i want you here when the cops come .
i don &apos;t want my son scared .
and i don &apos;t want some accident to befall me during the arrest .
uh , that won &apos;t happen , mr. bishop .
excuse me .
that will happen .
are you okay staying ?
yes . i mean , if it goes longer ,
i &apos;ll need to make some arrangements .
it shouldn &apos;t .
if he &apos;s arrested , it &apos;ll happen soon .
it &apos;s because i &apos;m peter &apos;s wife ?
that &apos;s why he wants me ?
yes . there &apos;s no better babysitter for a kingpin than ...
... the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s wife .
yes .
well , here goes .
and , uh , hardy time liquor ?
that &apos;s darren . darren holts , manager .
any worries there ? any financial irregularities ?
no .
you trust him ?
enough not to turn on me .
but , um , could he get into any legal trouble
that might lead back to you ?
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m ceo . i delegate .
i tried to control everything ,
but six months ago i ended up in chapter 11 .
dad ! dad ! guess what ?
hey , dylan . this is mrs. florrick .
she works with daddy .
so , did you break any bricks with your forehead ?
no , but i talked to damian .
he said he could come .
really ?
oh , would you excuse me ? yes ?
hey , it &apos;s me .
i &apos;m sorry i had to run out on you .
how &apos;s it going ?
good , fine . eli thinks we &apos;ll beat the expectations here .
which is , i guess , what it &apos;s all about .
good .
yes , but we are running into a problem on the article .
nothing yet .
believe it or not , there is a blog
that wants to print a story on the magazine for not running .
it &apos;s a backdoor way for the reporter to get her story out .
she leaks it to a blog ,
the blogger embarrasses the magazine ,
then the magazine ends up printing it , you know ,
the circle of life .
well , it was bound to happen .
you sound okay .
i do . i &apos;m just ... resigned .
i know the feeling .
well , i guess i &apos;ll call the kids and tell them .
oh , right , the kids . thanks . i ...
hey , we &apos;re gonna get through this , okay ?
okay . gotta go .
talk to you later .
would you like to do this later , mr. bishop ?
his eighth birthday party , and no one &apos;s coming .
parents of his friends don &apos;t want them around me .
and my son just thinks i &apos;m his ...
great dad .
i &apos;m sorry . that &apos;s hard .
check dex .
dexter roja . i moved him from one of the crews into management .
might &apos;ve been premature .
do you know how many of the businesses he managed ?
six .
all right , these are the six businesses managed by roja .
good . what &apos;d you find ?
nothing .
but we &apos;ll need a week with these . they &apos;re an accounting nightmare .
well , the cops have the same thing ,
so if we can &apos;t find it , they can &apos;t .
check the footnotes .
that &apos;s where accountants dispose of problems .
you seem to speak from experience , mr. hayden .
22 years as a cpa .
where does an accountant put his mistakes ?
i don &apos;t know . where ?
in the footnotes .
oh . i thought that was a joke .
why would i joke ?
well , you said it the ...
okay , cary , check the footnotes .
do you mind helping ?
i ...
sure .
so what do you call a win , eli ?
uh , the majority of the straw poll votes .
oh , come on . you guys have this hands @-@ down .
i &apos;m hearing you need 95 % of the vote
to keep the other two democrs from being contenders .
oh , my god , only the mainstream media
would take a 90 % landslide and call it a loss .
oh , that &apos;s what we &apos;re expecting ?
a 90 % landslide ?
please remember to cast your ballot .
the poll remains open until 8 : 00 .
huh ? um , i &apos;ll be right back , harv .
what are you standing there for ?
peter , can we talk ?
yeah , excuse me .
of course .
it &apos;s up .
how long ?
till mainstream gets it ?
my guess is the blogger sent out e @-@ mail alerts to all of them .
maybe half an hour .
we &apos;ve got to get our spin straight .
ouch .
now what ?
he mentions the cease @-@ and @-@ desist call from will .
who ?
i couldn &apos;t couldn &apos;t get a hold of diane ,
and i needed to intimidate him right away .
you had ...
you had will gardner send a cease @-@ and @-@ desist order ?
no . because the blogger was going ahead no matter what ,
so we pulled back .
excuse me .
don &apos;t do that , eli .
don &apos;t have will do anything for me .
it was an emergency .
i understand .
just don &apos;t get him involved .
you &apos;re right . i &apos;m sorry .
so we &apos;ll spin this as an attempt to smear you .
we &apos;ll make it a process story about how we address a smear .
no , no . just let it go .
don &apos;t even dignify it with spin .
these things die on their own .
you accusing me of skimming ?
no , no . it &apos;s just that there is a discrepancy in the books ,
and mr. bishop asked us to check in with you
because you &apos;re the manager of his bakery business .
show me .
show me the discrepancy in the books .
show him .
here , this footnote .
there &apos;s a 12 % bump in sales in the first quarter of this year .
we sell to the coffee chains . they expanded .
yes , but if you look here , there was no corresponding rise
in the purchase of flour or high @-@ fructose corn syrup .
so if you were distributing more units ,
your raw materials &apos; costs should be correspondingly higher .
we bought &apos; em last quarter
to hedge against the commodity prices .
no . not according to this spreadsheet
comparing year @-@ to @-@ year purchases .
who are you again ?
clarke hayden .
i work as a trustee at lockhart / gardner .
if you &apos;ll look here in this footnote , you &apos;ll see
there is no increase in the yearly profits either .
so i have to ask you , sir ,
if you had a 12 % rise , where did the surplus go ?
employee benefits .
what employee benefits ?
we bought all the employees memberships to a health club .
so you &apos;re also owned by lemond bishop ?
oh , yeah , but he pretty much lets us do what we want .
and you seemed to have had an increase
in health club memberships in the first quarter .
you usually have 40 to 60 new members .
and this year , you had 300 .
yes , we were thrilled .
right , but what we &apos;re finding odd
is that you &apos;ve only had 30 of the new members use the facilities .
well , here &apos;s the secret about health clubs .
most members like the idea of a health club ,
but they don &apos;t love using it .
but 270 members never showed up , even once .
really ?
yeah .
look . see this footnote here ?
what ?
mr. hayden , what is it ?
people think they can hide .
you know the wondrous thing about numbers ?
you can &apos;t hide .
how dare you ?
you &apos;re laundering money through our legit businesses ?
it &apos;s not your legit business . it &apos;s bishop &apos;s .
and we &apos;re his caretakers .
you &apos;re compromising our legit businesses ,
and you &apos;re not telling us .
your businesses wouldn &apos;t even exist without our business .
how do you think they &apos;re staying afloat ?
with drug money .
i don &apos;t know what &apos;s more startling :
your sanctimony or your hypocrisy .
you had a bigger problem , diane .
your accountant just found a discrepancy
in the health club juice bar ,
and we have nothing to do with that .
there &apos;s nothing wrong with the juice bar .
except that it &apos;s closed and it &apos;s still making money .
according to who ?
an accountant at our firm .
well , he &apos;s wrong .
it &apos;s just the health club making money .
stop lying , dex .
i put you in charge of this place .
you need to explain .
look , when we lost the other two health clubs ,
you said to be entrepreneurial , self @-@ starters .
i was trying something .
what ?
hgh .
i told you no drugs ! not on the legit side !
but it &apos;s not drugs . it &apos;s steroids !
look , i was clearing $ 120,000 a month .
the health club was gonna go under without it .
yeah . everything all right ?
no . there &apos;s some activity at the end of his block .
what do you mean ?
it &apos;s a cable tv van . looks like undercover .
trying very hard not to look like undercover .
okay , hang on .
hi . excuse me !
yes ?
i &apos;m so glad you made it .
i just live right there . come on up .
actually , ma &apos;am , we &apos;re not here for you .
i &apos;m sorry . what do you mean you &apos;re not here for me ?
i called you guys .
you said you were coming .
my wire is sparking really badly . it &apos;s dangerous .
sorry , ma &apos;am . we &apos;re here on another call .
yeah ? which house ?
what house was the call from ?
yeah .
that &apos;s private , ma &apos;am .
it &apos;s private which house you &apos;re going to ? why is that ?
because our work is confidential .
cable tv work is confidential ?
kalinda ! let the man do his work .
oh , lana , still on the lemond bishop track ?
mm @-@ hmm . you still working for drug dealers and pimps ?
yeah , and child pornographers .
is that him there on the phone ?
good old lemond bishop ?
no , it &apos;s my mother .
hi , mom . it &apos;s not the cops . it &apos;s the feds .
and it &apos;s not an arrest . it &apos;s a search warrant .
i just know how you love to know these things .
love you .
move now .
move in now .
go .
how far off are they ?
seconds away .
you going to tell him ?
i don &apos;t know .
he &apos;ll destroy whatever they &apos;re after .
i know .
what ? what was that ?
they &apos;re coming with a search warrant now .
how far ?
down the block now .
we messaged on the game box .
what about other video games ?
just the one .
okay , go get it .
it &apos;s in dylan &apos;s room .
dad ?
mrs. florrick , could you help with dylan ?
this is a federal warrant !
open the door or be subject to arrest !
open the door !
they should be gone soon .
did my dad do something bad ?
he says he didn &apos;t .
the kids talk about him at school .
be sure to check the furnace room and the cellar .
your dad says you go to camp .
what kind of camp is it ?
basketball camp .
are you a bulls fan ?
yeah .
i was there when they won their second championship .
you saw michael jordan ?
yep .
my husband took me there on our first date .
the only problem was ...
i knew nothing about basketball ,
and i had no idea what was going on .
don &apos;t suppose you could tell us what this is about .
we can point you in the right direction .
sorry , ms. lockhart .
the underlying complaint is sealed .
if you have a problem , take it up with a judge .
the game box-- it &apos;s missing .
thanks , kalinda .
i did a head count .
all the agents are fbi .
not a single one of them is from the dea .
which means this isn &apos;t about hgh .
if it were about steroids , there would be a dea .
the feds are giving us nothing
on the basis for this warrant .
the warrant will only be unsealed if they arrest lemond ,
and then it &apos;ll be too late to help him .
doesn &apos;t have to be mr. bishop who &apos;s arrested .
legally , any ...
... any arrest in connection with this search
would be grounds to unseal the warrant .
such as someone obstructing justice
by interfering with the search ?
i have my ballet class tonight .
you &apos;re looking determined .
i &apos;m here because your people filed a franks motion
以验证警方是否虚报搜查理由
to unseal the search warrant .
yes , i heard , but you usually
have more of a sense of humor about these things .
i &apos;m generally not all that smiley when my apartment is sealed off
and i have to crash at my sister &apos;s .
what ?
my apartment was ransacked a few hours ago .
you should remind your fine , upstanding client ,
mr. bishop , that breaking and entering is a crime .
how do you know it was bishop ?
nothing was taken .
no cash , no jewelry , no electronics .
they just tossed the place .
if he was trying to scare me ,
tell him it didn &apos;t work .
anything else ?
no , i &apos;m just glad you &apos;re okay .
thanks for the reassurance .
the arrest of mr. agos
was made during the search , your honor .
under the franks doctrine ,
that is grounds to unseal the warrant ...
the arrest was of one of mr. bishop &apos;s attorneys
who was not a target of the search .
but it was still an arrest .
and mr. agos was released immediately .
your honor ?
oh , i &apos;m here . i just need these sell orders ready
when the market opens monday .
you can &apos;t properly represent your client
without knowing what the warrant was about ,
and agent delaney thinks
that franks doesn &apos;t apply because the man arrested
had no connection to the warrant .
&apos;kay . continue .
mr. agos &apos;s fourth amendment rights against illegal search and seizure
are being egregiously violated .
the warrant is sealed
because mr. bishop is a public threat .
all right . i get it .
what we have here is a legal tie ,
and ties always go to the runner .
agent delaney , i am ordering the warrant unsealed .
tell them what they want to know .
a confidential informant ?
the warrant refers to him or her simply as &quot; c.i. 691 . &quot;
whoever it is has been missing for 72 hours .
the feds were searching your house
for evidence of this informant &apos;s whereabouts .
the good news is that
whatever this informant told the fbi ,
it &apos;s not enough to charge you .
we just need to figure out who it is and fast .
i need your cell phone .
my ... ?
uh , we think his home phone is bugged .
i need to call dex .
oh , crap .
hey , we &apos;re doing great . we got volunteers everywhere .
no , no , no , no . it &apos;s not that . look .
he &apos;s found a way to make it go viral .
that &apos;s ... indira starr ?
no . that is a photoshopped indira starr .
and if there &apos;s one thing the mainstream media likes ,
it &apos;s a visual .
look .
damn it !
you broke into her apartment ?
whose apartment ?
lana delaney .
you broke into a federal agent &apos;s apartment ?
hang on a minute . take a breather .
you know i don &apos;t do things like that anymore .
i &apos;m a changed man .
what are you doing ?
hi , my name is kalinda sharma ,
and i &apos;m at 10497 north damen avenue , apartment 3b .
i think there &apos;s been a break @-@ in .
no , but i haven &apos;t checked the bedroom yet .
would you please send someone ?
all right , thanks , and hurry up , please .
tell &apos; em you made a mistake .
you have 15 minutes .
no .
you have 15 minutes .
oh , my god , i think
i just heard a noise in the bedroom .
well , lookie here .
i think you definitely got termites .
my mistake . it was my husband .
no , i &apos;m fine . thanks .
the problem is ...
okay ...
i only found $ 10,000 .
where &apos;s the rest ... &quot; honey &quot; ?
i can &apos;t have you disrupting my life like this .
&quot; disrupting your life &quot; -- is that what i &apos;m doing ?
so , wh @-@ what do you call what you &apos;ve done to me ?
i haven &apos;t done anything to you .
you made me love you !
i can &apos;t love anyone else , all right ?
i &apos;ve tried .
you are in my head .
nick .
nick .
look , i &apos;m not the same .
you can see that .
you ...
you want me to be what i was .
your girlfriend &apos;s out to screw you .
i was in her apartment .
for you .
not for me .
she &apos;s got photos of you everywhere .
what photos ?
that &apos;s you there .
i don &apos;t know who that is , but ...
she &apos;s got these everywhere .
you need to know who your friends are .
this ... lesbian fed is not your friend .
okay , and you got to stop thinking down here .
get off of me .
don &apos;t ...
they &apos;re looking for a missing c.i. ?
yeah . that &apos;s how the feds got their search warrant .
and we think that &apos;s why they arrested the accountant .
they were shaking every tree .
they &apos;re coming after me .
they &apos;re building their case .
dexter ,
are there any employees
you haven &apos;t seen over the last few days ?
someone who could be the informant ?
maybe someone who didn &apos;t turn up to work ?
okay .
that &apos;s not good .
christina diaz .
she works at fine fitness on the front desk .
damn it .
if the feds ever questioned her , could that cause you trouble ?
possibly .
okay .
i think we just identified our missing c.i.
come on , eli . give me something .
only statement we have is that there is no story here .
here &apos;s what i want for illinois .
i want an illinois that
doesn &apos;t just think in terms of cook county ...
oh . come on . when did the mainstream media
start sucking up to bloggers ?
hi , eli .
troubles ?
no ,
just the normal course of business .
i hear we might get our 95 % .
beat the whole straw poll expectations game .
... access to better healthcare .
and we need ...
here comes the line .
to protect a woman &apos;s right to choose .
not bad , huh ?
i saw it , eli .
saw what ?
i &apos;m gonna call you back .
my friends are asking me what i think ,
which puts me in a very awkward position .
it &apos;s all smoke .
the story was killed because we proved indira starr lied .
there &apos;s physical evidence .
i can call our investigator over here to lay it all out for you .
my friends don &apos;t like this stuff .
they can swallow the fact
that there are no women in the race ,
but this just rubs it in their face .
well , i can assure ...
your friends ...
that it is a lie .
i want an illinois where every citizen ,
man and woman ,
young and old , can realize their dreams ...
what else does christina know ?
she knows about the hgh .
she was helping you sell ?
yeah .
did you talk with her about any other part of mr. bishop &apos;s business ?
i would never do that .
but you trusted her enough to run your hgh .
yeah . she was discreet .
you know , she never gave me any trouble .
were you sleeping with her ?
mrs. florrick asked you a question .
yeah , look , i liked her .
i knew you would think it was stupid .
when was the last time you talked to christina ?
just a few days ago , after work .
and you weren &apos;t curious that she didn &apos;t show up for three days ?
nah , she does that once in a while .
to get away from her boyfriend , um ...
noah something . he comes by fine fitness .
he always waits for her on his motorcycle .
every couple of weeks she just takes a break .
out of town ?
no . um ...
she has a ... another place ,
in logan square .
was there anything more on the lemond bishop case ?
we won the franks hearing .
found out it &apos;s about a missing c.i.
c.i. ?
confidential informant .
ah . of course .
any more need for accounting work on it ?
no , no , i think it &apos;s moved on .
maybe i should stay in case .
no , no , i @-@ i don &apos;t think you have to .
oh . okay .
i enjoyed it .
helping .
you were great .
the way that you told that guy ,
&quot; if you had a 12 % rise , what &apos;d you do with the surplus &quot; &quot;
he didn &apos;t like that , did he ?
no , he thought you were gonna mess him up .
you should talk to family law , mr. hayden .
they always have some probate issues involving accounting .
no . that &apos;s not why i &apos;m here .
you &apos;re here ... to help us get out of debt .
that &apos;s helping us .
true .
the best way to fend off
the story is to change the story ,
and the only way to do that is by winning big .
okay , go .
ms. starr .
miss hayward .
thanks for agreeing to see me .
of course .
uh , maddie , what is going on here ?
this young lady called my office , said she wanted to talk .
and you agreed ?
i just made a public statement in support of peter .
i &apos;d like to make sure i didn &apos;t make a fool of myself .
the woman is a consummate liar .
well , then you have nothing to worry about .
hee @-@ haw ! everybody vote !
dexter thinks there &apos;s a hideaway key by the front door ,
a magnet under the mailbox .
okay , great . got it .
be careful .
always .
she &apos;s dead ?
it appears so .
look , given the enclosed space and temperature ,
it &apos;s likely the body &apos;s been decomposing
faster than normal .
what about this boyfriend , this noah ?
noah mayfield .
he &apos;s a sound engineer at a recording studio on 16th ,
and he rides a motorcycle .
so that &apos;s who you saw ?
i don &apos;t know ,
but it &apos;s likely .
the question is ,
do we make an anonymous call
and let the feds know about the car ?
we don &apos;t know what this christina woman
gave the feds on lemond .
if we alert them to the body ,
we risk getting him arrested .
she &apos;ll be found eventually .
if it comes out
later ... that we had knowledge of this
and we didn &apos;t report it ,
they can use it against him at trial .
i &apos;m not gonna tell anyone .
how will it get out later ?
this is beyond risky .
i &apos;ve done time before .
but that was before dylan .
you &apos;ll make bail .
no . i won &apos;t .
i need you to draw up a guardian arrangement .
you have someone in mind ?
my sister .
she hates me ... but loves dylan .
i &apos;ll draw it up .
call the feds .
tell them about the body .
okay , sounds good . i &apos;ll talk to you .
too bad about your boy .
my &quot; boy &quot; ?
i didn &apos;t mean it that way .
what &apos;s wrong ?
you &apos;re being surly .
what is it you want ?
we found christina diaz &apos;s body .
we got an anonymous tip ,
and we found her body in the trunk of her car .
we done ?
we have evidence linking him to the murder ,
and judge etts just signed an arrest warrant .
we prefer mr. bishop turn himself in .
kalinda .
yes ?
listen ...
it &apos;s work .
don &apos;t let it get in the way .
in the way of what ?
of us .
but there isn &apos;t any us .
there never was any us .
peter ! peter ! peter ! peter ! peter !
ninety @-@ six percent .
you set a new record for an illinois straw poll .
acavello has announced he &apos;s dropping out ;
staub is huddled with his people .
he &apos;ll be gone by breakfast .
peter , we did what we needed to do .
you did .
you and maddie hayward .
let &apos;s keep her close ;
we need more allies like her !
peter ...
springfield is this close .
peter ! peter ! peter ! peter ! peter !
this is an agreement
naming your sister as dylan &apos;s guardian
until such time as your release .
sorry to interrupt .
we just heard from the federal agents .
they &apos;ll be here any minute .
my sister &apos;s still an hour away .
i &apos;ll wait with dylan until she gets here .
do you have any instructions you &apos;d like me to pass on to her ?
dylan &apos;s a heavy sleeper .
you have to give him three wake @-@ up calls .
okay .
and the kid never ... checks his pelling or punctuation .
she &apos;s gonna have to stay on top of him
when he does his homework .
okay .
hello ?
alicia , it &apos;s maddie hayward .
i hope i &apos;m not calling too late .
no , not at all .
are you at peter &apos;s celebration ?
um , i have a dilemma ,
and i &apos;d like to talk with you .
of course .
i &apos;m not going to be able to support peter &apos;s candidacy anymore .
i ...
i @-@ i don &apos;t understand . he won tonight .
he &apos;s the only candidate left .
i know , um , but this indira starr business has ,
uh ... forced me to reevaluate .
it didn &apos;t happen , maddie .
the woman lied .
i @-@ i would like ...
for us to try and @-@ and ... remain friends .
i @-@ i think that you and i are ...
simpatico .
is that possible ?
staying friends ?
sure .
well ... i &apos;d like to try .
uh , so why don &apos;t i give you your space .
i &apos;ll check in with you in a few days , okay ?
good night , alicia .
* lewis collins *
* took a trip out west *
&quot; and when he returned &quot;
&quot; little delia had gone to rest &quot;

&quot; that &apos;s the sad thing with life &quot;

&quot; just as other folks arrive &quot;
hi , dylan . why don &apos;t you show me all the toys in your room ,
okay , sweetheart ? i &apos;d love to see them .
&quot; and when the people heard &quot;
&quot; that delia was dead &quot;
&quot; all of them gentlemen &quot;
&quot; they dressed in red &quot;
&quot; the angels laid her away &quot;
it &apos;s time to go . open the door .
&quot; angels laid her away &quot;
&quot; they laid her six feet under the clay *
lemond bishop , you &apos;re under arrest .
you have the right to ...
