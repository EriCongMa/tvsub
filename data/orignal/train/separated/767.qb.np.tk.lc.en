okay , gas , electric , and cable
comes out to $ 219.34 .
jessica ?
do you have anything to contribute ?
here we go .
they &apos;re not all legal tenders ,
but they have value , like ...
sure .
that &apos;s $ 5.00 .
$ 5.00 .
library card .
library &apos;s not just for books any more .
library card .
also , you can check out compact discs .
what else ? this is a fortune .
um , yeah .
&quot; you are lucky and success . &quot; how ironic .
that &apos;s going right to the gas company . &quot; paid in full . &quot;
jess , we can &apos;t keep covering for you .
yes . i understand .
it &apos;s just that , um ...
recently i went through a , uh , life change
where i was fired .
maybe i can borrow
the money from my good friend ... winston ?
you know , i really wish i could , jess , but , uh ...
i &apos;m a single man now , so basically i have to be able to
trick women into thinking that i can buy them stuff .
okay !
here is my share ...
to the penny .
yeah ! i &apos;m not the poorest !
second poorest . now you &apos;re the poorest .
that &apos;s gotta be rock bottom .
yeah , i got it .
you know what ? i &apos;m shutting off the gas
until you can get me the money .
what ?
what are you talking about ?
don &apos;t scapegoat me .
i just gave you my money .
that &apos;s called tough love , all right ?
no more handouts .
now , what are you going to do about it ?
how are you gonna pay the gas bill ?
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;ve got an idea .
get a job .
the school year &apos;s already started .
i have a lot of decisions to make
as far as my resume is concerned .
i have to choose a font ,
spacing , columns ...
okay , just update your resume , you ninny .
did you call me a ninny ?
yeah , i called you a ninny ,
&apos;cause you &apos;re acting like a ninny , you ninny !
don &apos;t call me a ninny , i &apos;m pmsing !
ah ! why would you ... yucky !
no , no , no .
i don &apos;t want to hear it .
it hurts .
i feel like i &apos;ve laid a million eggs
and they &apos;re all hatching .
i feel like i want to murder someone ,
and also i want soft pretzels .
you know what ? i feel the same way .
shut up ! shut up , you !
&apos;cause i don &apos;t want to hear it !
i &apos;ve had it !
if any of you cross me ,
i &apos;m gonna kick the testicles clean off your body !
clean off ! you &apos;ll look like ken dolls down there .
because that &apos;s where i &apos;m at right now .
now which one of you guys
wants to tell me to get a job ?
who wants to look me in the face
and tell me to get a job ?
whatever .
&quot; whatever ? &quot;
what does that mean , huh ?
whatever .
it better mean , &quot; whatever you say , jess . &quot;
i don &apos;t think it &apos;s fair that women have an excuse
once a month to act irrationally angry
when the rest of us have to keep it together all the time .
you &apos;re irrationally angry 365 days a year , nick .
what are you talking about ?
i will push if i want to push !
come on !
i hate doors !
really ? well , that &apos;s just your personal opinion ,
&apos;cause i don &apos;t have anger issues .
you guys think i have anger issues ?
well , i mean , i wouldn &apos;t exactly call it an issue .
an issue is something you can fix .
been that way since i can remember .
this is some watered @-@ down nonsense .
you &apos;re some no @-@ good shysters !
on an unrelated note , i &apos;ve just decided to take a walk .
fine ! leave !
now , if you &apos;ll excuse me , gentlemen ,
i &apos;m gonna go get a job , like it &apos;s my ...
job ?
shut up !
please don &apos;t do that , sir . please .
i would love to sit by myself right now .
there &apos;s something real creepy about you , pal .
you want to get weird ? let &apos;s get weird .
you got a nice face .
anger problem ?
living with them ? are you kidding me ?
it &apos;s frustrating .
it &apos;s like ... just get a job .
i like your hat .
i like how it &apos;s not a team or a logo ,
it &apos;s just blue .
would you rather be covered in fish scales or feathers ?
scales ?
wow , you weirdo .
you want to see me jump really high ?
i &apos;m afraid of dying , man .
who am i ? !
the enemy is en @-@ e @-@ my .
the enemy is the inner me .
can you understand a word i &apos;m saying ?
you just nod at everything .
i need to change .
and you &apos;ve showed me that .
i have an anger problem .
thank you .
can i get a hug ?
i &apos;ve got a story for you guys . ooh .
i met someone at work .
emma sharpe .
divisional vp of all north america .
wh @-@ what are you doing in the break room ?
this break room is in north america , isn &apos;t it ?
sure .
that means i &apos;m the vice president of it .
i am the vice president of everything in north america .
that sounds like ... sexual harassment .
robby , there &apos;s a fine line between sexual harassment
and something awesome .
i thought you hated your co @-@ workers .
you said they were a bunch of ...
pant @-@ suited corporate she @-@ hulks ?
yeah , i know what i said .
emma is the craziest woman to ever hit on me .
schmidt , you &apos;re such a nice guy .
thank you .
what you deserve is a girl who respects you .
you know ? a nice girl .
i &apos;m not into the nice thing , robby . doesn &apos;t do it for me .
well , that &apos;s what i thought , too .
yeah .
you know , until i found , uh ... this one right here .
you mean cece ?
you think that i &apos;m ... nice ?
no .
i think you &apos;re the nicest .
robby !
yes , the man just left .
and he turned off the gas .
yeah , i &apos;m refusing to pay my gas bill
as a matter of principle .
you &apos;d like me to take the survey ?
of course i &apos;ll take the survey .
schmidt ?
yeah , hold on .
can i share some thing with you , man to man ?
oh , i &apos;m ...
you have to promise me you will not laugh .
look , i &apos;m ... you &apos;re not talking to nick , here .
you &apos;re talking to schmidt .
schmidt , i think i &apos;m getting my period .
okay .
this is a real thing , okay ? i looked it up on the internet .
it &apos;s called , uh , &quot; sympathy pms , &quot; right ?
now , apparently this is an affliction
that men suffer from all the time .
right on .
i don &apos;t know how it happened , man ,
but somehow , i got on that woman &apos;s cycle of menstruation ...
and i got that menstruation inside of me .
winston !
men can &apos;t get their periods .
where would they put the tampon ?
hey ! are you calling me stupid ?
you &apos;re the one that &apos;s stupid , okay ?
you jack @-@ faced butthole !
who &apos;s the jack @-@ faced butthole
who turned off the hot water ? !
witch ! what have you done to my body ?
shut up , you !
why is there no hot water ? !
oh , i &apos;m sorry , jess .
if you don &apos;t pay , you don &apos;t play .
you also don &apos;t shower .
are you serious ?
thank you , denise .
hey , great buddies .
ow , my skin !
okay .
roommates ... hey , buddy .
don &apos;t poke me .
something wonderful happened to me today ,
and i am no longer angry . it &apos;s gone .
oh , shut up , nick .
so let me get this straight :
nothing at all &apos;s going to set you off ?
that &apos;s right .
nothing &apos;s gonna get to me ,
&apos;cause it &apos;s a new nick miller .
awesome . hey , winston , tell him what you have .
sympathy pms . it &apos;s a real thing , i looked it up .
sympathy pms ? what &apos;s that ?
no !
pms is mine !
stop stealing my stuff , winston .
you &apos;re telling me you &apos;re having
a pre @-@ menstrual something right now ?
yes .
okay .
it &apos;s like a character in a judy blume novel .
no ! you can &apos;t have my menzies .
he &apos;s got her menzies .
no part of this conversation
is making me want to boil over with rage .
i feel really good , guys .
hey , gang , why is the water so cold ?
schmidt turned off the hot water ,
because it &apos;s not enough that i have to go on an interview
with the red devil in my belly ,
i also have to go unshowered .
so let me get this straight :
there &apos;s no hot water in the whole house ?
yeah .
seems strange .
maybe a cold shower will wake you up
to some harsh financial realities , jessica day .
you don &apos;t control my heat , theodore p. gasbag .
this is good !
we got a lot of feelings going around .
a lot of anger .
and you . you ...
you &apos;re suddenly calm ?
yeah .
really ?
it feels like a fat man &apos;s sitting on my uterus .
i hear that .
gonna go to the store !
does anybody want anything ? !
thank you , denise .
hey , you wanted to see me ?
shut the door .
quick reflexes . good .
i am going to devour you .
you see that contract ?
oh , the thick one ?
with all those tabbies ?
do me on it .
pick that up .
did you just ask me to pick it up to see me bend over ?
no .
oh , wait , i &apos;m doing it .
stand up .
what is this thing ?
you &apos;re gonna have to sign it before anything can happen between us .
&quot; party a absolves party b
&quot; of any psychological trauma ,
whether temporary , permanent , future or imagined . &quot;
after we do what we do , you &apos;re gonna want to talk .
i can &apos;t allow that .
the less risk i incur , the more i can focus on
creating a viable sexual experience for both of us .
you &apos;re gonna want to sign it .
&quot; possible exposure to lead paint . &quot;
do i have a latex allergy ?
that &apos;s very important .
&quot; guaranteed mercury poisoning &quot; ?
is this real ?
you have till week &apos;s end to sign it .
what is your name ? !
i can &apos;t keep thinking of you as my magical best friend with no name .
joe . tommy .
louis . tran .
is it tran ?
what a crazy guess !
beautiful name . fits you perfectly .
my roommates are killing me .
fine , you &apos;re right .
okay , i like them , all right ?
i hate myself . is that what you want me to say ?
why do you always have to make everything so simple ? !
how do you just get it ?
how do i become you ?
show me the way , man . i &apos;ll do anything .
all right , man , i &apos;m in .
you lead , my man .
all right , whatever is about to happen &apos;s gonna happen .
jessica day ?
so why do you want to teach adults ?
i think it &apos;s really inspiring that these people have chosen
to go back to school , you know ,
that they want to read to kill a mockingbird ,
that they want ...
i named my dog boo after ...
after boo radley ?
exactly .
that &apos;s amazing .
oh , my god .
she was a puppy .
she &apos;s so cute .
i know .
such a cutie .
this cup is so tiny .
so cute .
sorry , how did she fit in the cup ?
i just don &apos;t understand .
just physically , how did she get so small ?
i &apos;m sorry , um ...
i &apos;m sorry , i got this ...
i don &apos;t know what &apos;s wrong .
so weird .
never happens to me .
she &apos;s really cute .
yes , she was .
did she die ?
it &apos;s fine .
it &apos;s been two years .
puppy ...
in a ...
cup .
so ...
we &apos;re both dog people , right ?
schmidt , am i nice ?
no .
thank you .
nobody thinks i &apos;m a nice girl , okay ?
i &apos;m the mistake .
ah , robby .
midwestern heart , midwestern body .
i &apos;m the one who messes things up .
i agree with you .
i feel like he doesn &apos;t even know me .
you &apos;re getting your smell all over the comforter .
oh , my god .
took me months to get rid of that heavenly curry smell .
what happens when he realizes he was wrong about me the entire time ?
he &apos;s just gonna run away .
i would , i would never run away from you .
but if i did , i would run way faster than robby .
&apos;cause he &apos;s slow .
and i &apos;m fast .
maybe i &apos;m just not meant for a functional relationship .
you know me , schmidt .
you don &apos;t ever have to be nice around me .
i &apos;m not scared of you .
i mean , i &apos;m bad .
i do ...
i do bad things .
i don &apos;t think you &apos;re a nice girl .
think you &apos;re the worst .
no .
no ... ?
no . i can &apos;t do this to robby .
but you &apos;re a bad person . we discussed that .
you &apos;re a bad person , i &apos;m a bad person .
yep .
we can totally do this . no qualms .
i have a qualm . i have a qualm .
you don &apos;t have a qualm .
we sold our qualms ,
and we used the profits to buy perfect bodies .
robby is right .
i &apos;m nice .
i &apos;m not nice , all right ?
and i like robby , but that is doing nothing right now
from stopping me from wanting to kiss you .
stop , stop , stop , stop .
but i @-@ i don &apos;t want to stop .
i really don &apos;t .
i will never stop wanting to kiss you .
i am a monster .
i got to go .
yeah , sure . have fun .
thank you . i really needed this .
and i ...
i &apos;m a monster .
okay .
what is this place ?
what are you ... ?
what would you like ?
what does this mean ?
let &apos;s not do this .
let &apos;s not take off our clothes .
let &apos;s go back to the park where it was good ...
what do i know ?
we &apos;re taking our pants off ?
okay . keep those underwear on , am i right ?
yeah .
stay on . underwear good .
why are you cradling me like a baby , friend ?
this is not how guys of my generation hang out .
this is a moment that got away from me , man .
oh , that &apos;s my butt .
this is intimate .
how did you know ?
you are a huge baby .
yeah , i am .
i am a huge baby .
forget it , i &apos;m done .
i &apos;m not getting a teaching job .
just can &apos;t go back out there , you know ?
oh , i feel you , jess .
i took a sick day .
i just stayed at home and did a watercolor of mountains .
so you gonna get this , like , every month ?
i mean , it &apos;s a possibility from all the information
that i &apos;ve read on the internet .
that women like you
are the alpha .
what ?
you &apos;re like the powerful moon , and all the women in your life
are just latched on to your cycle .
in my case , grown @-@ ass man .
oh , yeah , good news .
the gang &apos;s all here .
guys just pms @-@ ing ?
not in the mood today .
don &apos;t really feel like being yelled at ,
so what i &apos;m gonna do is go ahead and leave ,
because right now i &apos;m feeling very fragile .
i understand .
what &apos;s wrong with you ?
i &apos;m no longer angry !
all the anger that used to be inside of me is gone !
it &apos;s gone , it &apos;s gone !
this is the worst thing i &apos;ve ever seen .
what is wrong with you ?
no .
period &apos;s got you down ?
that is such a raw deal .
want me to get you a sanitary napkin ?
okay , i won &apos;t get that .
but you &apos;re okay with pads or tampons
or whatever it is that you &apos;re using ?
tell me about your day , please .
i want to get into your universe .
let &apos;s rap it out . go .
floor is yours , pal .
talk , talk , talk .
i want to listen .
no .
30 seconds of direct eye contact ?
stop it , nick . please , stop .
in three seconds , i &apos;ll be silent .
one , two ...
i bombed all my interviews .
what ? what happened ?
i was sabotaged by my baby box ,
which means i &apos;m never gonna trust anything that comes out of it .
so that rules out a family .
i know just the thing you need .
come with me .
welcome to the wonderful world of water massage .
you are a piece of seaweed .
you are totally happy .
i don &apos;t mean to touch your boobs !
you &apos;re touching my boobs !
i don &apos;t mean to touch your boobs !
fail , fail , fail .
the next move is ...
oh , my ... !
relaxing is important . relaxing is important .
relax !
oh , no .
what are you trying to do ? !
kill me ? !
it worked for me .
i was trying to help you .
i &apos;ve been watching you doubt yourself for months .
i &apos;m not doubting myself .
you &apos;re doubting yourself , jess .
no , nick , it &apos;s pms .
it &apos;s not pms .
you got knocked down .
it &apos;s time to get back up .
and get up long enough for one of these bozos to hire you .
i believe in you .
so does that guy .
think you can do that ?
and if you don &apos;t , i &apos;m gonna water massage you again .
can you do that ?
yes .
can you do that ?
yes !
jessica day ?

weren &apos;t you here the other day ?
weren &apos;t you here the other day ?
yes , i was .
well , i signed it . please note the added provision .
in any autobiographical account of my life ,
you want to be referred to as moises perdue .
non @-@ negotiable .
but you &apos;re fine with the rest of it ?
look , i &apos;m a depraved freak ,
and i want to wander into your narnia of sexual terror
and emerge like a freshly birthed calf .
put your hands out .
let &apos;s do this .
are you ready ?
i &apos;m ready . all right .
oh , yeah .
okay .
interesting technique .
hold tight .
i mean , i could totally get out of this .
what , have you never bound somebody before ?
i got to start over .
this your first time ?
are you rejecting me ?
no , i-- no .
i mean ...
because legally ... you can &apos;t .
now take off your pants .
okay .

nevertheless , we are gathered here today to celebrate
the reemployment of jessica f. day .
not my middle initial .
who will once again
be in the classroom , molding the minds of children .
