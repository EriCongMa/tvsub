yeah , and it feels like you spent two weeks on it .
i have to give this speech tomorrow .
so rewrite it .
they didn &apos;t ask you because you &apos;re an expert
on opt @-@ out moms .
they asked you because you were an opt @-@ out mom .
clarke , where are you ?
in traffic .
new york is the city of endless possibilities .

uh ... rayna hecht wants to meet right now .
what ? why ?
clarke , we &apos;re not ready .
we are ready . just tell her about the firm .
she doesn &apos;t care about our size .
she wants to go someplace with a future .
she &apos;d down in the lounge . she &apos;s waiting right now .
we got to go .
cary , listen to me .
she brings a full portfolio of clients with her .
over $ 60 million a year in billing . we need her .
she is the very definition of a rainmaker .
what ? clarke ...
can you turn down your tv ?
i &apos;m trying , but the mayor
won &apos;t stop talking .
but i guarantee you ...
rayna hecht is a rainmaker .
we need her . every firm in chicago ...
new york is the city
of endless possibilities .
it &apos;s a different adventure ... - and he &apos;s back .
i can &apos;t hear you , all right ?
i &apos;m gonna have to call you back . bye .
why am i having so much trouble with this speech ?
look , look , look .
it &apos;s the keynote speech at the aba
and you &apos;re trying to impress people . don &apos;t .
they don &apos;t want to hear facts and figures ...
they want to hear your story .
you went from an opt @-@ out mom to the partner in a law firm
in four years .
that &apos;s your speech .
thanks .
there .
every lawyer is after her .
great .
can you believe this ?
i &apos;ll be honest .
i like you guys . i do .
and i do intend to decide in the next 48 hours .
but i want a partnership that i can believe in .
i &apos;m leaving hartley &amp; jenner because of the indictments .
if you &apos;re worried about my suspension a few years ago ,
that &apos;s past , and i &apos;m a better lawyer for it .
good pitch .
thanks .
okay , well , let me get my little ducks in a row ,
and we &apos;ll talk .
thank you , ms. hecht .
thank you .
so , you &apos;re a big firm now ...
making a presence at the aba ?
out shaking the trees , just like you .
good luck with the keynote tomorrow .
don &apos;t let him get in your head .
ms. hecht , hello .
i &apos;m cary agos . alicia florrick .
hey . i &apos;m sorry if i don &apos;t sit down ,
but i need to make a few calls .
why don &apos;t we do this another time ? good to meet you .
what happened ?
we lost our slot .
she &apos;ll vet us .
we &apos;re good .
no one &apos;s under indictment .
damian .
he &apos;s not under indictment .
well , we want her .
$ 60 million in client billing .
you coming ?
uh , no , i &apos;ll see you later .
lot of lawyers at this thing , huh ?
do you have a minute ?
no .
i can take my time , mr. gardner .
i was on the blagojevich case .
we always knew that sooner or later the lawyers would talk .
they want to talk ; they need to talk .
they know that attorney @-@ client privilege only gets them so far .
earplugs , please .
the problem you have , mr. gardner ,
is that voter fraud is an ongoing crime , a conspiracy .
if you &apos;re protecting the governor , you &apos;re just as guilty .
that &apos;s why you &apos;ll talk .
the governor is not your friend .
no one ... no judge or disciplinary body ...
will blame you for breaking attorney @-@ client privilege .
you can &apos;t freeze me out , mr. gardner .
i &apos;m an agent of the office of public integrity .
i have subpoena power .
i &apos;m sorry , i can &apos;t hear you .
i &apos;ll get on with clarke , see if we can set up another time .
okay , and i will get on with robyn
and have her look into her background .
no , no , no , you go back to your room and you work on your speech .
cary , it &apos;ll only take a minute ...
alicia ...
you &apos;re procrastinating .
go back to your room and work on your keynote .
okay ? remember , personal stories .
robyn , what are you doing ?
just ... write anything down .
mrs. alicia florrick .
hi . i &apos;m lorainne joy .
thank you for coming in .
oh , thank you for inviting me in , ms. joy .
how could i not ?
your name just sort of popped out at me .
oh , my god , your husband .
if my husband did that to me ...
look , i don &apos;t know what i would do .
thank you .
no , i know what i would do .
i would ... probably scratch his eyes out .
that &apos;s what i would do .
oh ... you don &apos;t need to give me a resume .
just tell me about yourself .
when did you last practice law ?
well , officially ...
13 years ago .
but ... i helped advise on a lot of cases .
on your husband &apos;s cases ?
yes .
uh @-@ huh . well , good .
listen , here &apos;s the thing ... alicia .
we don &apos;t really have any positions available
at the moment .
i know ... the position we have
is for starting associate .
oh , well , i &apos;m ... i &apos;m open for that .
no . that wouldn &apos;t really be appropriate .
you know , we make a big play
for the ivy league pool for that , so ...
alicia florrick .
when can you start ?
what ? when can i ... start work ?
yes . you want to work here ?
i do . uh , um , now .
i &apos;m ... tomorrow , if you &apos;d like .
good . uh , come on back in ,
and i &apos;ll assign you a desk .
yeah !
it doesn &apos;t officially show till wednesday .
how much ?
well , i warned you you &apos;d fall in love with it .
it &apos;s not really in your range .
i have a job now .
my range has changed . how many rooms ?
three . two baths and a maid &apos;s .
i love the light . the windows are great .
i have a three- bedroom on 5th .
it &apos;s half this rent .
i like this .
i &apos;m ... i &apos;m sorry . what ?
it &apos;s a paralegal job .
mr. acocella , i &apos;m sorry , but ...
i ... i @-@ i thought it was an associate position .
yes , i know , but it &apos;s
more of an internship .
mr. acocella , i made plans based on that understanding .
i made ... financial outlays ...
i &apos;m sorry .
i ... told the partners .
they were worried about your last name .
they don &apos;t want you here as an associate .
i need a paycheck .
i &apos;m sorry .
marina , it &apos;s alicia .
the apartment ...
is there any way to get out of the lease ?
hello .
yeah . uh , i @-@ i forgot . i &apos;ll be right down .
what is the key to litigation ?
what is it ?
who was that man by the elevator ?
what man ?
have we stopped trusting each other ?
nelson dubeck .
office of public integrity .
they &apos;re pursuing a case against ...
the governor .
the ballot box ?
why you and not me ?
there &apos;s a surveillance tape .
smoking gun . i took it to peter florrick .
what are you going to do ?
unfortunately , mr. pling
couldn &apos;t make it because of the hurricane
i don &apos;t know .
but another litigator has agreed to step in .
please welcome a new voice to this aba meeting ,
elizabeth , uh ... elsbeth
tascioni .
sorry .
hello . whoa .
sorry .
okay .
okay . um , what is my approach ...
to litigation ? well ...
no . will , no .
okay ...
sorry . i want everybody to close their eyes
and picture a pillow ,
a big pillow , the size of this room ,
and you &apos;re lying in the middle of it .
now , take off your shoes .
then i &apos;ll give a brief introduction ,
and you &apos;ll enter from that wing over there .
you sure there &apos;ll be this many people ?
oh , yes . we &apos;ve had great interest in your keynote .
now , is there anything you &apos;ll need tomorrow ?
a speech .
no , i meant ... bottled water ?
alicia .
we have a reprieve with rayna hecht .
it &apos;s clarke .
hello ? mr. hayden ?
i can &apos;t hear you .
alicia ? hello ?
if fashion &apos;s your thing , you &apos;ll find
the best shopping in the world ,
soho , chelsea , greenwich village ...
how &apos;s that ?
better .
i just talked with rayna hecht .
she wanted to apologize for her abruptness .
she didn &apos;t know you were you .
i was me ?
the governor &apos;s wife .
she &apos;s coming to your keynote .
she can &apos;t wait to hear what you &apos;ll say .
the speech . did he tell you
that the speech matters ?
you need to do a good job with your keynote .
she wants to wait to decide whether to meet
until after the keynote .
and that &apos;s the most i &apos;ve ever said &quot; keynote &quot; in my entire life .
so how &apos;s the speech coming ?
alicia ? hello ?
clarke ? where are you ?
okay , clarke , i @-@ i can &apos;t hear .
where are you ?
alicia florrick .
i haven &apos;t seen you since georgetown .
another life ago . you work here ?
in this building ? no . on madison . what about you ?
i just got a job .
you did ? really ? where ?
wells &amp; brolin .
that &apos;s a good firm . congratulations .
thanks .
nice shoes .
a baby threw up on my shoes .
you going to the garage ?
yes . you ?
uh , deposition .
it was nice seeing you .
and , hey , uh ...
i &apos;m sorry about all that crap with your husband .
thanks . it &apos;ll die down .
it will .
call me sometime .
stern , lockhart &amp; gardner .
hey . you got top billing .
mm , i &apos;m an impressive person .
i never doubted it for a minute .
it was good seeing you .
you , too .
oh , thank you so much .
i love bears .
um , can i just have one hug ? okay ?
you dirty jew .
excuse me ?
you dirty stinking jew .
did you just call me a dirty stinking jew ?
what , are you deaf ?
oh , my god .
elsbeth , thanks for meeting me out here .
there &apos;s too many lawyers at the hotel .
did you hear that ? that bear just called me a dirty jew .
what ?
that bear there .
he said i was a dirty stinking jew .
watch out ! that bear is ...
anti @-@ semitic !
elsbeth , look ,
ab @-@ about my situation .
i &apos;ve been subpoenaed by nelson dubeck ,
the office of public integrity , and he &apos;s using it to pressure me
to get to peter florrick .
but it would mean breaking attorney @-@ client privilege .
right .
if you testify against governor florrick ,
you risk disbarment .
but if you don &apos;t , you risk contempt of court .
right .
not good .
it &apos;s that one percent doctrine .
hey , watch out for that bear !
the what ?
one percent .
if you &apos;re even one percent vulnerable , you &apos;re vulnerable .
who got you this video ?
kalinda .
good . good .
i &apos;ll call her . i like kalinda .
hey . are you with that bear ?
because i think someone needs to talk to him .
s @-@ so you &apos;ll represent me on this ?
this dubeck guy , he &apos;s at the hotel ?
yes .
good . okay , yes . okay .
i &apos;m feeling a bit vulnerable , but i &apos;m gonna use it .
yeah .
kalinda , it &apos;s will . how are things there ?
pass it here .
uh ... yeah , they &apos;re fine .
things are different when the lawyers are gone .
kalinda , we need your help on something .
this is elsbeth .
kalinda .
kalinda , hi . oh , i miss you .
i miss you , too , elsbeth .
can you look into someone named nelson dubeck ?
he &apos;s with the office of public integrity .
anything you can find , dirt or past arrests .
maybe he has a drinking problem .
i am not a dirty stinking jew !
但它毕竟存在过
is there any way ...
to delay the lease ?
okay .
no , i &apos;ll ...
i &apos;ll figure something out .
you can always live with me .
oh . thank you so much , jackie .
but this is a good school district .
you don &apos;t need to worry about a good school district .
hold on . alicia &apos;s here .
okay , give us a minute .
that was robyn . she has an instinct on rayna hecht .
how &apos;s the speech going ?
mr. hayden , you got out of your taxi .
yes , i decided to walk .
it was only 15 blocks .
so , robyn thinks hecht isn &apos;t leaving her firm
because of the indictments .
or just because of the indictments .
what then ?
the firm has ten senior partners
and hecht was the only woman .
a boys &apos; club .
so she probably wants a more woman @-@ friendly firm .
okay .
so just ...
just play up the feminism angle in your keynote .
frame your story as one of female empowerment .
okay . thanks . i need to , um ... write .
and i &apos;ve been talking up the keynote .
a lot of potential clients are excited about it .
okay .
let &apos;s let the master at it .
you &apos;ll be great .
mr. gardner .
i just wanted to say ...
i &apos;m a worthy lawyer who needs a job .
women are underrepresented in this business ,
and i shouldn &apos;t be overlooked just ...
hello , will ? it &apos;s alicia .
do you have a minute ?
no , really ?
you did not .
i don &apos;t look anything like those photos anymore .
well , um ...
you said i should call if i got a chance , so ...
this is me calling .
what are you wearing that for ?
you weren &apos;t even here .
don &apos;t change the subject .
it &apos;s business @-@ like .
you spent $ 300 on it .
well , that &apos;s what a good dress costs .
your husband is wasting away in prison
and you &apos;re trying to seduce your way into a job .
your son is the one who put me here .
i have two kids .
what am i supposed to do ?
no .
you like nice things .
so go be a whore .
i did- did do that .
so ...
that covers me up to last june .
now about you ?
oh , well ...
there &apos;s not much to say .
i &apos;m a mother , a wife
and now a disgraced spouse .
i &apos;m sorry .
no , no , no , no , that ... that wasn &apos;t self @-@ pity ,
that was me trying to make light of it .
i think i &apos;ve lost my touch .
no , the touch is still there .
and now you have a new job ?
unfortunately , it was a paralegal job .
voluntary .
you &apos;re kidding .
yeah ... no .
i was , um , misinformed .
have you thought about working here ?
is there an opening here ?
well ... we could .
i haven &apos;t worked in 13 years .
are you saying you &apos;re rusty ?
no !
no .
i &apos;m good .
you &apos;ve always been good .
will , i ... i &apos;m ...
my connection with my husband hurts me .
why are you trying to dissuade me now ?
i don &apos;t know .
because i &apos;m making no sense .
we &apos;ve all got a past that could hurt us .
don &apos;t let yours hurt you .
you here for the job ?
i think i am .
you ?
yup .
cary .
excuse me .
what did you think of me when you first met me ?
is this about your speech , or more procrastinating ?
speech .
i liked you .
you did not .
do you even remember where it was ?
yeah , in reception .
waiting for our interviews .
i thought you were gonna get it .
and i wasn &apos;t .
i thought you were a cocky new associate .
i was a cocky new associate .
and i thought you were entitled .
i was a little entitled .
poor . but entitled .
can you be both ?
oh , yeah . so ...
who would you hire if we had to hire someone today ?
you .
yeah , me , too .
you &apos;re supposed to say me .
no , no .
and you wouldn &apos;t hire yourself , either .
you &apos;re right . i hate that about myself .
no .
it &apos;s smart .
so why did will hire you ?
because you &apos;re a slut .
what ?
nothing . i need to finish .
okay .
good luck .
thank you , kalinda ,
that is great .
uh , good @-@ bye , ka ... uh , kalinda .
i don &apos;t know .
yeah , i got ... i got to go , someone &apos;s here .
uh , hello ?
elsbeth tascioni . how are you ?
i &apos;m good . do i know you ?
oh , no .
but you &apos;re nelson dubeck from the office of public integrity .
you helped prosecute rod blagojevich .
i did . do you need something ?
yeah , i need you to leave will gardner alone
or i &apos;ll sue you for harassment .
mr. gardner should consider how seriously i take this .
take what ?
he acquired a videotape
of a stuffed ballot box .
he brought that videotape to the governor @-@ elect .
and he attempted to show it to him .
what videotape ?
what is that ?
that is a videotape of three men taking a ballot box
into a polling place .
no , it looks like a ... gif .
or is a &quot; jif &quot; ?
gif .
have you ever seen the gif of that bear , uh ,
falling onto a trampoline and then bouncing into a pool ?
it is so funny , but i was surprised to find out
that the pool was ... faked .
all digitally futzed with .
if you &apos;re suggesting that
this videotape was in any way manipulated ...
oh , eight bits per pixel makes a gif highly manipulatable ... ble .
i hope you have the original ,
because otherwise i &apos;m gonna object
to the jif being admitted into court .
the governor &apos;s guilty .
how do you know that ?
he &apos;s the governor of illinois .
and ...
you think they &apos;re all corrupt ?
no , they just happen to be all corrupt .
so it doesn &apos;t matter what the facts are ,
you &apos;ll prosecute peter florrick for the crime of voter fraud ?
peter florrick spent six months in prison . he &apos;s a criminal .
who was exonerated .
no , his case was dismissed .
so you &apos;re out to get him .
i &apos;m out to get a criminal .
even if there &apos;s no proof ?
i &apos;ll find the proof .
this is elsbeth tascioni recording
nelson dubeck in the lobby
of the harrington plaza at ...
11 : : 33 p.m.
i &apos;d erase that , ma &apos;am .
you did not have my permission to make that recording ,
and without that permission you are subject to prosecution .
oh , no , not in new york .
two @-@ party consent is the law in illinois , s
but this is new york .
one @-@ party consent is enough here
and i am one party .
and i give my consent .
i suggest you leave mr. gardner alone , sir .
he &apos;s a nice man .
he has no part in your vendetta against governor florrick .
by the way ,
you should look into an anti @-@ semitic
costumed furry bear in times square .
very few lawyers can reach their prime
after a decade as a mother in suburbia ,
but alicia florrick is ...
special .
row four , far left .
great .
remember , say it loud and with a smile .
people will believe whatever you tell them .
oh , and , uh , rayna hecht is here .
it would help our cause if you could dazzle her .
... alicia florrick .
the governor &apos;s guilty .
how do you know that ?
he &apos;s the governor of illinois .
you got him to say that ?
i didn &apos;t get him to say anything .
he wanted to say it .
if he comes after you , we &apos;ll use it .
but he &apos;s not coming after me .
i don &apos;t think so . not with what he has .
oh , you &apos;re a lifesaver .
no , no , no .
i &apos;m just , um ...
got to go .
i prepared by looking in a mirror .
it was the only interview i could still get .
when you &apos;re sitting across the desk
from someone who can hire you ,
you feel every one of those 13 years .
but , luckily , i had a very good interviewer .
he asked me if i was up to it ,
coming back to the workplace .
the interviewer pointed out that i was
arguing against myself .
i should stop ...
pointing out reasons why i shouldn &apos;t be hired .
what did i learn from this ?
use everything you have
to get the job .
and don &apos;t feel entitled .
will gardner .
just hear me out .
the hiring committee has voted .
yeah , but we shouldn &apos;t penalize her .
her face is on the news 24 @-@ 7 .
every political blog is writing about her .
wait , she wasn &apos;t the one who slept with the hookers .
were you involved with this woman ?
what ?
you never push for associate hires .
she was my friend .
and ... the smartest person in our class .
give me something i can sell to the other partners .
there &apos;s a lawyer i &apos;m trying to bring on board ,
but i &apos;m getting some push back .
i need you to put a dossier together on her .
okay . who is she ?
alicia florrick .
peter florrick &apos;s wife ?
yeah . why ?
nothing .
of course , the advantage of being a woman opting back in
is that no one ever questioned
why you opted out in the first place .
women are cut little slack on this .
men , even less .
i looked into alicia florrick .
i spoke to her old firm .
she managed to win a couple dozen cases
before taking her maternity leave .
even managed to bring in some small clients .
but ?
they were about to fire her .
they thought she wasn &apos;t tough enough .
she never knew , but they said
she lacked a killer instinct .
what do you want me to do with this ?
bury it .
the one upside to a scandal or a tragedy in your life
is that it is the best kind of wake @-@ up call .
would i have done it any differently if i were a man ?
would i have ...
uh , would i have done ...
i mean , uh ...
uh , would i have felt differently if i were a man ?
what &apos;s going on ?
lindler just launched a hostile takeover of mrg pharmaceuticals .
everybody wants to get in on it .
excuse me .
the answer is i would never do it differently .
the key is to raise your profile .
opt @-@ out moms are held to a higher standard
than anyone else .
we ... have to work harder .
we have to make up for lost time .
uh , is there any other ... ?
it was across the street .
i &apos;m almost finished . i won &apos;t bother you .
scotch , no ice .
they only have beer .
beer .
it &apos;s hard to get drunk on beer .
mm , you just got to try harder .
yeah , yeah .
she doesn &apos;t like me , and i don &apos;t give a flying crap .
flying crap .
go to hell . is that better ?
you &apos;re in a bad mood .
i just had 300 people walk out on me .
it looked like 400 .
why do you hate me ?
well , i don &apos;t like you .
hate &apos;s probably too strong .
why ?
are you serious ?
because of that ?
three weeks . three weeks you were scheming .
that wasn &apos;t my fault .
i wanted to leave right away .
with our clients .
wow . it just never ends .
don &apos;t ask the question if you don &apos;t want the answer .
what ?
we could never make it work .
you &apos;re linking two things together i never did .
thanks a lot .
you want to say &quot; bitch , &quot; say &quot; bitch &quot; &quot;
bitch .
so ,
you &apos;re saying that if i were any other partner leaving ,
you would hate me the way you do ?
i &apos;m saying , if you were any other partner ,
i &apos;d be as unhappy and competitive as i am now .
i don &apos;t believe you .
that &apos;s your right .
you &apos;re enjoying your pain too much .
so ,
you &apos;re gonna fight me on every client , every case ?
i will be your competitor .
you &apos;re up for it .
you &apos;re a big girl .
okay .
i guess it &apos;s something .
mm . it &apos;s something .
yes .
where are you ? can you talk ?
i &apos;m in the coffee shop across the street .
and no .
someone &apos;s sitting near you ?
yes .
rayna hecht was impressed with your speech .
she wants to meet .
uh ... when ?
now . she &apos;s leaving early tomorrow .
now ?
i @-@ i &apos;ve had a few .
few ?
nothing . uh , where ?
in the lounge . she wants to have a quick drink with us .
great .
a meeting ?
a very important meeting .
how to destroy our competitors .
good . i expect no less .
may the best man win .
mr. gardner ?
yes ?
we &apos;ve never met . jim moody .
i used to work ...
i know who you are .
i need five minutes of your time .
no .
please .
look , this guy from justice , dubeck ...
he &apos;s turning the screws on me .
listen to me .
you and i are both witnesses in a grand jury hearing .
legally , we cannot talk to each other .
i just want to make sure you and i are telling the same story .
did you hear what i just said ?
i only did what eli gold told me to do that night .
i don &apos;t care .
you stay the hell away from me , or i &apos;ll call security .
five minutes isn &apos;t much time ,
so just keep it all bullet points .
i &apos;ll talk about firm culture , and alicia ...
i will handle women @-@ friendly policies ,
and crapital structure .
our what ?
capital structure .
you said &quot; crapital . &quot;
no , i didn &apos;t .
mrs. florrick ,
are you inebriated ?
i &apos;ll be fine .
oh , dear god .
okay , all right . well , let @-@ let us just talk ,
and then , you just go ahead ...
hello . oh , don &apos;t get up .
don &apos;t get up . please .
i &apos;m so sorry for blowing you off earlier .
and don &apos;t say i didn &apos;t , because i did .
ah , mrs. florrick . hello .
hello .
powerful speech .
and i &apos;m sorry so many of our colleagues had to miss it .
thank you .
so we wanted to talk about our firm . we &apos;re just
getting started , but we read your article ...
i &apos;ll be honest .
i like you guys . i do .
and i do intend to decide within the next 48 hours .
and i &apos;m interested in your firm because you
have female partners .
yes , we try not to discriminate ,
in promotion at all .
good .
were you unhappy at lockhart / gardner ?
oh , i ... um , i was happy up to a point .
they ... uh , let me grow .
they let me ...
... learn .
and then , i had to put what i learned on its feet .

well , to a grand jury ,
it &apos;s going to look like two witnesses conspiring to
cover up election fraud .
that &apos;s ten years in federal prison .
you can &apos;t be serious .
the best part , ms. tascioni , is
this is the original surveillance video .
the chain of custody is perfect and unimpeachable in court .
