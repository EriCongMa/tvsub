infections are like sleeping monsters .
you can &apos;t see them .
you can &apos;t feel them .
but ...
you must do everything in your power ...
to contain them .
because when the monsters wake up ...
they &apos;re out of control .
bailey , you shouldn &apos;t be here .
how is seth lepik ?
the computer says access restricted .
they won &apos;t even let me check on my own patients .
they swabbed my nose .
they &apos;re swabbing everyone &apos;s noses .
well , are they sitting everybody down for interviews ?
&apos;cause they think i did something wrong .
now i think it &apos;s the grafts .
i narrowed it down to--
look , bailey ,
they &apos;ve isolated the strain of staph in your patients .
now they need to find out how it spread .
your job is to cooperate .
i &apos;ve got seth .
now go answer their questions .
please .
we are throwing bailey under the bus .
come on . that is not what we &apos;re doing .
no , it seems like that &apos;s exactly what we &apos;re doing .
two of our patients are dead of the same post @-@ op infection .
a third one &apos;s barely hanging on . it was time .
we get the c.d.c. in here and figure this thing out .
by treating bailey like a criminal ?
she hasn &apos;t done anything .
i hope that you &apos;re right .
truth is , we don &apos;t know that yet .
c.d.c. is simply asking us
to temporarily freeze bailey &apos;s files .
oh , come on .
and that we not discuss this investigation with her .
so today , just keep your distance .
that is ridiculous .
also i think now &apos;s the time to put out a statement .
no , no .
no . whoa . whoa . about what ?
i mean , we don &apos;t even know
if bailey &apos;s the source of this thing .
if one of ours is at fault
and we just sit on this information ,
we look like we &apos;re trying to cover something up .
the only way to let the public know
that we can be objective is by being transparent .
vote ?
i &apos;m just saying ,
people should learn the news from us .
there &apos;s no news .
okay , vote ?
there &apos;s no news yet .
vote . all in favor of no press release .
okay . no press release . no statement . clear ?
watch it , members only .
promise me you &apos;ll be nice .
these guys are trying to take down bailey .
they don &apos;t deserve nice .
no , not to the c.d.c. to jason .
i &apos;m nice to jason .
two minutes ago , you said , &quot; hey , i have
a surgery today with your d @-@ bag boyfriend . &quot;
yeah , but i said it with a smile .
fine . i won &apos;t call the guy a d @-@ bag .
at least not to his face , anyway .
i &apos;m moving in with him .
so what do you think ?
i think it &apos;s great .
really ?
no . i think the guy is a douche bag
who you &apos;ve known for about two minutes ,
and that makes you an idiot for moving in with him .
alex--
i &apos;ll be nice !
i &apos;m gonna rock this corner kick .
later , i promise .
right now i have a surprise for you .
look who &apos;s here .
grandma !
oh , ethan .
as you can see ,
there aren &apos;t any residual effects from the surgery .
so ... i can go home ?
well , i &apos;d like to keep an eye on you for another few days .
well , we can handle a few more days .
right , buddy ?
hey , grandma , do you want to see dad ?
i can take you .
oh , uh , is that ...
can--can he--
sure , sure .
he sees his dad every day . he chats up a storm .
he told him all about you coming to visit .
dad &apos;s still unconscious .
that &apos;s because his brain is resting .
it &apos;s not uncommon after a trauma
for a person not to wake up right away .
and speaking of paul , i &apos;d like to see him , too .
if that &apos;s all right ?
ethan , do you feel up to
pushing your mom around in a wheelchair ?
oh , yeah .
murphy ?
i &apos;m not supposed to talk to you about this .
dr. bailey .
come in .
tell me there is
someone down here that i can help .
it &apos;s five against one with the board today ,
and i need a victory .
bed three . femur &apos;s broken . i &apos;m sending him up to angio .
okay .
alert the press .
see what i mean ?
you all right ?
matthew dumped me .
because i lied to him about my virginity
like you told me to .
that &apos;s not--
i lied because i had something to lie about .
april , hold on a second--
you took my ...
i shouldn &apos;t have let you , but i did , and now he &apos;s gone .
i &apos;m not board certified , i &apos;m not a virgin ,
and everything i care about has been ruined because of you .
so you know what ? thank you . thanks for that .
six against one .
help ! yeah , help ! we need some help over here !
what happened ?
god , i &apos;m gonna pass out .
we lost some fingers .
a lot of fingers .
we--we had a tug @-@ of @-@ war .
with what , razor wire ?
even better . clothesline .
does anybody have the severed fingers ?
yeah , i got &apos; em . i got &apos; em .
whoa ! that &apos;s a lot of fingers .
yeah , i counted six .
oh , no , five . this one &apos;s a turkey dog .
&quot; sleeping monster &quot;
i would thank you
to take me through each operation .
well , i mean , if you &apos;re looking for the source ,
look at the grafts .
i used the same ones on each patient .
this part of our investigation
concerns your interaction with the infected patients
in the operating room , to the best of your memory .
i &apos;d never used this brand before .
i remember not recognizing the company .
uh , dortmund or something--
dr. bailey ,
we &apos;ve looked at the grafts .
it &apos;s not the grafts .
may i begin ?
oh , i was expecting a probing .
that &apos;s really more of a gentle swabbing .
speaking of probing ,
i &apos;ve decided to have the baby naturally ,
but i know the second i start to scream ,
derek is gonna have them pump me full of drugs ,
so i &apos;m gonna need you there in my corner .
yeah . uh , i &apos;m not gonna do that .
uh , when babies come out , people poop on the table .
cristina--
uh , no .
karev . can you make it fast ?
peckwell &apos;s h.l.h.s. mom is gonna be admitted .
we gotta go walk her through the procedure .
she wants me to watch her give birth .
you &apos;re gonna poop on the table .
i am not .
you are . almost everybody does .
okay , so i poop on the table .
it &apos;s part of the miracle of life .
it &apos;s nasty .
did i ask you to watch me give birth ?
no .
cristina ?
we have been friends a long time .
you want to know how ?
by not watching each other poop .
holla .
well , the good news is , these wounds look salvageable .
i wasn &apos;t even gonna play , but my brother al insisted .
and then we were losing , and al was all ...
&quot; wrap your hands with the rope ... &quot;
then i ... did .
what are you doing ?
uh , i just need to identify whose fingers are whose .
that looks like a pretty good match .
yeah , except for the red nail polish .
yes .
that &apos;s my sister @-@ in @-@ law &apos;s . jane , good news .
your manicure &apos;s intact .
hi , jane . i &apos;m dr. avery .
you mind if i take a look here ?
how &apos;s my daughter-- frances ?
tony , how &apos;s frankie ?
it &apos;s bad , honey .
the bone &apos;s still sticking out .
this is all gigantor &apos;s fault .
what &apos;s he doing at our reunion anyway ?
he &apos;s not even related . he &apos;s uncle tony &apos;s weird friend .
i didn &apos;t mean to pull so hard .
lay off gunnar , cash . it &apos;s not his fault .
he didn &apos;t suggest to play tug @-@ of @-@ war with a clothesline .
you want to blame somebody , blame your uncle al .
okay , kellers , i &apos;m back
and i &apos;m armed with french fries .
huh ? any takers ?
we can &apos;t eat , al .
we &apos;re just about to get our fingers reattached .
okay , uh ... anybody cold ?
i @-@ i can find blankets .
stop , al ! just stop !
nobody &apos;s hungry or thirsty or wants to run a relay race !
reunion &apos;s over .
okay , frankie . i &apos;m gonna need to get some x @-@ rays .
you gonna be okay being away from your family
for a little while ?
yes , please .
yeah . okay .
dr. hunt says it &apos;s good to talk to him , too .
hey , babe .
i gotta be honest with ya . you &apos;ve looked better .
me ? well ...
i haven &apos;t looked this good since that summer
that we went to the river and i got that stomach bug
and i lost , like , 15 pounds .
you &apos;re missing it .
stop it .
it &apos;s not funny .
none of this is funny .
my son is dying .
he &apos;s--he &apos;s not dying .
we are a long way off from that .
i know that this may look bad , but you--
it should be me .
hey , ethie .
um , why don &apos;t we give grandma
a little one @-@ on @-@ one time with pop ?
you want to take me for a spin ?
i think that &apos;s a great idea .
go on . give her the nickel tour . all right ?
can i hold him after he &apos;s born ?
just for a minute .
uh , he &apos;s gonna need to go right into surgery .
your baby has hypoplastic left heart syndrome
and an intact atrial septum
that is causing a restriction to blood flow .
he &apos;s fine when he &apos;s in utero , but once he &apos;s out ...
the condition is fatal .
which means he won &apos;t be getting enough oxygen .
we &apos;ll let you hold him when he &apos;s stable ,
after his surgery .
okay , so we &apos;ll do the c @-@ section ,
and then we &apos;ll have 60 minutes to get him to the cath lab
and perform the operation to open his septum .
and if you don &apos;t make it in time , he could die ?
no , we can do the c @-@ section in the cath lab .
it &apos;ll give us more time .
deliver in one room and operate in the other .
can you do that ?
i don &apos;t see why not .
there are about a thousand reasons why not .
you know , people have babies all over the place--
taxi cabs , high school bathrooms .
if we don &apos;t have to waste time
moving the kid from one floor to another ,
why should we ?
because you don &apos;t do c @-@ sections in cath labs .
oh , karev , back me up .
i &apos;m with peckwell .
not my name , but okay .
this whole situation is high risk .
if something goes wrong ,
we don &apos;t have the tools on hand to deal with it .
are your tools glued to the floor ?
bring them with you .
okay , we have an opportunity here
to do something new
and badass .
i mean , don &apos;t you want to be the badass
who delivers the kid in a cath lab ?
who does that ?
nobody ... but you .
okay .
okay , i &apos;m in .
all right . karev , you with peckwell ?
myers . dr. jason myers .
nobody cares . karev ? all right .
sounds like one nasty tug @-@ of @-@ war .
it was the height of idiocy ,
which is saying a lot for my family .
i &apos;m a journalist .
i cover the sophomore beat for my school paper .
and they chose me to edit
the spring supplement this weekend ,
but my parents told me
i had to go to this stupid reunion ,
that it was more important to pretend
not to hate people i hate .
and now my hand is ruined and my career is over .
whoa . whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa .
your hand is going to be just fine .
i will see to that .
okay ? and ...
you have lots of time to worry about your career .
okay ?
okay .
all right . so do you have any questions before we start ?
just one . someone took my cell phone .
can i get that back ?
sure . right after the scan .
and i have a follow @-@ up . what &apos;s the c.d.c. doing here ?
okay , we &apos;re gonna lie down now .
good . all right . try to stay still . try to stay still .
thank you .
okay , beginning with joyce .
joyce basche--i placed an a.v. graft for hemodialysis .
take me through that .
i made an incision
over the radial artery and basilic vein--
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m going to ask you to go back a little further .
did you scrub ?
did i scrub ?
for how long did you scrub , roughly ?
4 minutes , 36 seconds , exactly .
you &apos;re sure about that ?
i am .
i used &quot; think , &quot; the aretha franklin song .
i run it in my head . it &apos;s 2 minutes , 18 seconds .
hospital protocol is a 4 @-@ minute scrub ,
so i go through it twice .
and the scrub nurse who handed you your instruments--
that was ?
fran . she was right across from me .
well , now the graft is in place ,
and you secure .
i did a standard vascular anastomosis with running prolene .
i checked for leaks . there were none .
and you closed or dr. murphy ?
wait . the doppler .
i ... confirmed good flow with the doppler .
then i closed .
and it--it went perfectly .
all right . anything else you remember ?
i remember saying , &quot; that went perfectly . &quot;
all right . let &apos;s move on to seth lepik .
i got this .
what the hell &apos;s going on ?
these guys won &apos;t tell us anything .
sir--
i want my son outta here .
i want him transferred to another hospital right now .
i understand . i &apos;ll have to tell you ,
moving seth now would put him
at greater risk for more complications .
if we &apos;re hoping to avoid another surgery--
you &apos;re damn right , we are .
you &apos;re not touching my son again .
see what you can do to arrange a transfer .
hey , myers set up for the c @-@ section in the cath lab .
we need to run through the steps of the procedure .
look at you . &quot; myers . &quot;
you say it like he isn &apos;t nailing your girlfriend .
she &apos;s not my girlfriend .
whatever . you love her .
she &apos;s my friend .
you sound stupid when you say that .
she &apos;s moving in with the guy .
what am i supposed to do ?
beat him up .
no . i &apos;m gonna try to be nice to him and get along
so i don &apos;t lose my friend .
or you could punch him and take back your girl .
hi , frankie .
hey , have you found my phone yet ?
uh , not yet . so this is dr. robbins .
she &apos;s gonna assist me in surgery .
now your hand was pretty badly crushed ...
from the trampling ,
so it &apos;s gonna mean an extensive surgery
to repair these bones here and here
and fixate these .
oh , my god .
it &apos;s gonna be okay , though , right ?
i mean , she &apos;s gonna be able to , you know , use her hand ?
oh , that &apos;s the goal .
sweetie , i &apos;m gonna go tell your mom you &apos;re gonna be okay .
okay .
okay .
it &apos;s worse than we thought , honey .
all right , so do you have any questions
before we take you up ?
no .
okay .
actually , i do have one .
um , the c.d.c. is investigating dr. bailey
because several of her patients died , right ?
uh , um , who told you about dr. bailey ?
i asked an orderly . oh , shoot .
i mean , i can &apos;t reveal my sources .
but you just confirmed it for me ,
so you can be my second source .
oh , no , i didn &apos;t .
that &apos;s dr. robbins ?
what are you doing ?
checking bailey &apos;s post @-@ ops .
i thought richard was taking care of bailey &apos;s patients .
just seth lepik , the infected guy . i took the rest .
bailey &apos;s patients are all turning up with staph .
you &apos;re pregnant . why take the risk ?
because i &apos;m looking out for bailey .
and i &apos;m trying to look out for you .
this is why i need cristina in the room .
what room ?
the delivery room .
wait . what ?
hey . hey , hey , hey .
on @-@ call room , you and me ?
oh , i wish .
uh , but i have an atrial septostomy with karev .
oh . but after i save a baby &apos;s life ,
i &apos;m gonna need to celebrate .
okay . well , find me .
oh . how , uh , is the grandma ?
uh , she &apos;s sweet , but useless .
rachel &apos;s doing better , though , so at least ethan &apos;s got her .
mm . paul &apos;s gonna wake up .
i &apos;ve been doing serial neuro exams .
i have a good feeling .
spoken like a true scientist .
mmm . thank you .
thank you for having a good feeling .
anytime .
oh , mer asked me to be at her birth
and watch her poop on a table .
you have to do that .
can &apos;t i just show up after
when everyone has control of their bowels ?
watching a baby be born is like seeing god in person .
spoken like a true scientist .
i used scissors to shorten the graft to fit .
took about a centimeter off .
i remember mr. lepik had deep vessels .
um , so i asked fran for more retraction .
i &apos;m sorry . fran ?
you named linda
as your scrub nurse on mr. lepik &apos;s surgery .
yes . yes , right . sorry .
then i finished the graft , and i closed .
well , what about the leak ?
according to mr. lepik &apos;s chart ,
there was a small leak on the venous side .
yes . lepik .
yes . uh , he had a leak .
um , and i put in an interrupted stitch .
you remember that ?
yes , i remember .
i irrigated with antibiotic solution
to avoid infection , then i closed .
you closed ? that &apos;s important .
i did . i closed .
you &apos;re sure ? because your--
did you put the cap on the toothpaste ?
sorry ?
i assumed you brushed your teeth this morning .
so did you put the cap back on the toothpaste or didn &apos;t you ?
or can you be sure ?
because when you do a thing every single day--
dr. bailey , we &apos;re talking about the lives of two people .
what , you don &apos;t think i know that ? d @-@ don &apos;t insult me .
these are my patients who died .
you think i don &apos;t know that far , far better than you ?
so again , uh , are you sure you closed ?
can i take a break , please ?
there &apos;s only a little more to , uh ...
do .
hey . is your interview over ?
we &apos;re ... on a break . wait . wait .
aren &apos;t you supposed to be avoiding me like the plague ?
come on . what can i do to help ?
anything ?
i just want to know how seth lepik is .
i &apos;d like to see his chart ,
but they locked me out of the system .
dr. grey .
she wants to check on her patients .
what do you think she &apos;s gonna do , alter their charts ?
that &apos;s what the c.d.c. is gonna think , yes .
well , maybe you called them too soon .
i am thinking of the bigger picture here .
she &apos;s part of that picture .
we need to stand by our doctors .
even if she &apos;s at fault ? we stand by her then ?
she &apos;s not .
but we should cross that bridge when we get to it .
we &apos;re kind of at that bridge .
uh , excuse me , uh , dr. avery ?
yes .
sorry to bug you , but i was just kind of wondering ,
is there , uh ,
any update on my family ...
or their fingers ?
mom ? mom !
somebody help my mom ! mom ?
what &apos;s wrong ? what &apos;s going on ? she needs some help .
uh , ma &apos;am ?
hey , what &apos;s your mom &apos;s name ?
rachel .
dr. bailey , step away from the patient , now .
okay , let &apos;s clear the wheelchair and the tables .
i got it .
make room .
okay , lay her down . all right . all right .
call a code .
mom !
page dr. shepherd , stat .
yes , doctor . okay .
okay , amelie , here we go .
scalpel .
it &apos;s gonna be okay , honey .
but what if it &apos;s not ?
shh .
no ! stop .
i can &apos;t do this .
not right now .
his heart is okay now .
and you all know that when he comes out ,
it &apos;s going to stop working .
i &apos;m not ready for him to die .
amelie , honey--
no . look at me . look in my eyes .
you have to do this .
your baby &apos;s life depends on it ,
and you are wasting time .
we &apos;re all here .
we &apos;re all doing our best to save your baby &apos;s life .
breathe with me .
okay . one more time . one more time .
you can do this .
right ?
right .
she &apos;s ready .
just confirm what i have so far .
there &apos;s some kind of an infection
going on in the hospital linked to dr. bailey .
you don &apos;t even have to say anything .
you can just nod if i &apos;m close .
let it go , woodward .
who &apos;s woodward ?
uh , you should know that .
you should give me back my phone .
you &apos;re denying my second amendment right .
wait . you want a gun now ?
duh . first . i meant first amendment , obviously .
look , there &apos;s this girl named k.k.
who wrote an article about some bird
that everyone thought was extinct but living in her backyard .
it got picked up by the a.p. ,
and now she &apos;s a stringer for the &quot; times . &quot;
this is a real story .
i mean , i have an opportunity here to be awesome .
why don &apos;t you count backwards from ten ?
mm @-@ hmm . okay ?
ten ...
nine ...
you &apos;re obstructing the free press .
what &apos;s after nine ?
eight ...
seven ...
what are we gonna do when she wakes up ,
roll her up in a rug and stick her in the trunk of a car ?
is he okay ? is he alive ?
he &apos;s beautiful .
thank you .
i got him .
please save my baby !
let &apos;s move , people .
coming through ! clear the way !
shepherd ?
her pupil &apos;s blown . she &apos;s re @-@ hemorrhaged .
i need to get her to an o.r.
what the hell happened ?
i &apos;ll let you know when i know .
okay , let &apos;s go .
check her breath .
i &apos;ll see you up there .
she &apos;s gonna be okay .
we &apos;ve got her and we &apos;re gonna take care of you .
hey , hey . room 10 @-@ 24 .
she &apos;s gonna take you to your grandma .
wait for me there .
come on . this way .
what is it ?
he &apos;s dropped his pressure .
i can &apos;t hear breath sounds on the right .
okay , run fluids wide open .
get me a chest tube tray , fast .
right away , doctor .
in the vena cava .
what is the oxygen saturation ?
35 .
inside the right atrium .
nobody move . nobody breathe .
oh , seth .
oh , dear god .
chest tube , now . hold on .
perforating the septum .
why isn &apos;t the blood going through ?
because i &apos;m not through . just give me a minute .
now i &apos;m through .
man , i &apos;m good .
so my mom &apos;s dead ?
yes .
but dr. shepherd said she was getting better this morning .
yes , but there was something going on in her brain that was ...
sudden
and couldn &apos;t be prevented .
there was no way of knowing that this was going to happen .
mm . could it have been the ice cream ?
like a brain freeze ?
no . no .
ethan ...
there was nothing anyone could have done to have stopped this .
well ... i need to go now to my grandma .
she needs someone to hold her hand .
i &apos;m so sorry .
all right , deedee and jane &apos;s surgeries both went very well .
ohh . they &apos;ll be in recovery soon .
cash is still in surgery ,
and dr. torres is in with frankie now .
her fractures were complicated , but hopefully , with therapy ,
she &apos;ll regain full use of her hand .
therapy ?
how much therapy ?
well , that &apos;s hard to say now , tony .
but it could be anywhere from six months to a year .
you hear that ?
a year of physical therapy , al .
and then she might get full use back . might .
let &apos;s look at the bright side now--
the bright side ? everyone is mangled .
well , not frankie .
she got lucky .
she &apos;s still got all her digits , tone .
her hand was crushed !
i know . i @-@ i @-@ it &apos;s horrible . i @-@ i know it . and ...
and i &apos;m sorry , but , hey , well ,
well ... we &apos;re all here for you .
and , uh ... that &apos;s why we &apos;re a family , right ...
for stuff like this ?
hey . come on , huh ?
mr. keller .
let me get a look here . you all right ?
i think i broke my hand .
he &apos;s not stabilizing .
he needs surgery immediately .
no , not in this cesspool .
an ambulance is coming for him .
no , he &apos;s too unstable to transfer .
i &apos;m canceling all--
you guys have some infection running rampant .
it &apos;s not safe .
it &apos;s not the hospital . it &apos;s one doctor .
the infection came from one doctor and one doctor alone .
she &apos;s been isolated ,
and the infection has been contained .
i &apos;ve been tested . i &apos;m clean .
the o.r. has been tested . it &apos;s clean .
if we don &apos;t go right now , your son &apos;s gonna die .
do what you have to .
save my son .
you cleared to scrub in ?
yes , sir . they cleared me this morning .
okay , prep him .
so bailey did do something wrong .
of course not .
i only said that to get their kid into surgery ,
and if you repeat it , i &apos;ll have your ass fired
before you finish talking , you understand ?
baby &apos;s looking good .
heart function &apos;s hypokinetic but improving .
yang says that &apos;s to be expected .
that yang &apos;s a piece of work .
yeah . well , try living with her .
listen , man , i appreciate your work today .
i think this thing with jo got us off on a bad foot .
she cares a lot about you .
we &apos;re friends . that &apos;s all .
all right .
all right .
i had a messed @-@ up childhood , too .
i was a foster kid like her . it was crappy .
but i didn &apos;t have it near as bad as jo did .
i was never homeless , never had to live in my car .
but she &apos;s , uh , really turned it around for herself .
and i just , uh ...
i want the best for her , that &apos;s all .
yeah , okay .
yeah . thanks for today .
every year , it keeps on getting
harder and harder to plan these things
and to get everyone to come .
why do it ? doesn &apos;t seem like they appreciate it much .
they &apos;re all that i have .
i almost got married a few times ,
but i always messed it up .
my family is tony and jane and deedee and cash and ...
everybody else out there .
and i &apos;m just meant to be , uh ...
annoying uncle al .
well , you &apos;ll think of something for next year .
i mean , you just gotta ...
just gotta keep trying .
do i have the staph strain ?
i &apos;d like to start again with seth lepik , please .
i made a small transverse incision ,
minimal blood loss .
i deepened the incision into the subcutaneous tissue ,
asked for retraction .
b.p. was good . all vitals were good .
b.p. &apos; s 90 over 60 and falling .
more laps .
there you go .
suction .
you tested me for staph .
can i get those results , please ?

our investigation has determined the presence
of methicillin @-@ resistant staphylococcus aureus usa600 .
bailey--
oh , dr. bailey , you should not be here right now .
this is about me .
i &apos;d like to hear it .
that &apos;s your call .
we have a protocol for a reason .
okay , we vote .
she stays .
staph aureus usa600
is an antibiotic @-@ resistant infection
with a range of symptoms
from simple skin rashes
to fatal sepsis .
we have traced the source of the infection to one doctor .
dr. miranda bailey .
is a carrier of mrsa usa600 .
but the real culprit here is the gloves .
records show the surgical gloves
in use at the time of outbreak , march 15,
shipped from the manufacturer hemming synthetics , incorporated .
we switched
to hemming &apos;s gloves when pegasus was here .
our testing reveals manufacturing defects .
microscopic tears in the gloves , which facilitated
the transmission of staph usa600
to dr. bailey &apos;s patients .
it is the c.d.c. &apos; s determination ,
were it not for the defective gloves ,
the patients in question would not have been infected .
as for dr. bailey ,
we recommend eradication measures
before she can go back to any kind of patient care .
all right .
thank god .
best possible outcome .
here are copies of our report .
the c.d.c. thanks you for your time and cooperation .
and please feel free to call my office
if you have any questions .
thank you .
what &apos;s this ?
it &apos;s a press release .
we &apos;re putting it out in the morning ,
which means you have 12 hours to scoop the &quot; times &quot;
or the a.p. or whatever .
be awesome .
wait . i have a question .
one .
and i have a follow @-@ up .
turns out bailey &apos;s not at fault . defective gloves .
i heard . that &apos;s great .
you know what ?
i spent my entire day getting treated like the bad guy .
i &apos;m not gonna do this with you anymore .
you want to feel guilty about what we did ?
go ahead .
just leave me out of it .
i didn &apos;t force you to do anything .
i &apos;m sorry that you &apos;re hurt . okay ?
i &apos;m sorry that matthew broke up with you .
as far as us sleeping together ,
i &apos;m never gonna be sorry about that .
april ?

where were you when my patient was alive ,
when i could &apos;ve helped him ?

and i protected you .

and i stood by you .
i expected the same from you .
i deserved it . i earned it .
but all you cared about ...
