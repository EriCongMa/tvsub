nick ! your house guest is urinating in the bathroom
tony the tiger style .
naked with a kerchief ?
what ?
naked with a kerchief .
no , what do you call top , no pants ?
oh , that &apos;s like a winnie the pooh or a paddington .
honey the smacks frog .
there &apos;s a donald the duck .
i guess pretty much any kind of bear except for yogi
&apos;cause that &apos;s naked with a tie .
alvin , simon , theodore .
i saw his entire butt .
look , dirk &apos;s a good guy .
he was my roommate when i was in law school .
smartest guy i know .
so , he &apos;s a lawyer ?
no , he &apos;s not a lawyer , but he does have a law degree ,
a business degree , and a master &apos;s in agriculture .
he &apos;s kind of like a degree collector .
he &apos;s got his phd in poetry , so ...
that sucks for poems .
how &apos;d it go with fancyman ?
it was an amazing first date ,
except for one awkward part at the end .
i don &apos;t go on dates very often .
guys my age always want to skip the date
and just go right for the gold ,
which i don &apos;t give them
because i &apos;m stingy with my gold .
unless they dig for it .
i haven &apos;t even gotten to the awkward part yet .
black sedan ?
uh , yeah .
what ?
so , he patted me on the back .
i thought i &apos;d at least get a front pat .
what ?
look , he probably just got nervous .
no , russell &apos;s never nervous .
that &apos;s the worst answer .
winston , what do you think ?
oh , thank god .
hey , what &apos;s up , baby ?
hey , is that shelby ?
what was that ?
that was a cat sound .
oh , because you did the whip , we should &apos;ve ...
guys !
it should have been the other way around .
okay , i &apos;m just gonna ask cece .
but next time you guys want advice about girls ,
don &apos;t come crawling to me .
you got it .
that sounds good .
no , that was a joke .
i love it when you guys ask me stuff .
it makes me feel really important .
and i love it ...
&quot; one shade the more , one ray the less . &quot;
&quot; had half impaired the nameless grace . &quot;
are you wearing a ladies &apos; scarf ?
come to my lecture tomorrow night .
absolutely not .
she &apos;s missing out , my man .
hey , schmidt ?
yeah ?
mind if i borrow your car to take shelby to the airport ?
i don &apos;t have a car , winston .
hey , schmidt , uh , you mind if i use the , uh ,
&quot; man @-@ bulance &quot; ?
the man @-@ bulance is resting .
he needs to get ready for the corporate team @-@ building retreat on monday .
that &apos;s cool . i &apos;m sure the man @-@ bulance couldn &apos;t handle
all of shelby &apos;s luggage anyway .
what the hell is wrong with you , winston ?
the man @-@ bulance could fit the luggage of nine shelbys .
it has the towing capacity of a thousand shelbys .
you know what ? here you go , winston .
there you go .
enjoy luxury .
all good , man . i got your second set , so thank you .
how &apos;d you get my second set of keys ?
hey , someone left your door open .
someone left your face beautiful .
who is that ?
apparently , his name is dirk .
sorry , dirk , i &apos;m seeing somebody .
but should that stop you from seeing this ?
yeah ! that &apos;s awesome .
does he keep you happy ?
he does what he &apos;s told .
so you &apos;re the boss and he &apos;s your little secretary ?
you &apos;re a sex @-@ cretary ?
i am definitely the boss .
sex @-@ cretary , he just made that up .
i hate bachelorette parties .
i have , like 50 different penis items in my carry @-@ on .
this plane goes down ,
there &apos;s gonna be some sharks doing some really weird stuff .
sharks ? i thought you were going to vegas ?
no , i &apos;m going to mexico . i thought i told you that .
well , if you don &apos;t want me to go ,
i don &apos;t have to go .
no , no , no , no , no , no , i want you to go .
it &apos;ll be good , you know ?
we spent the last five nights together .
i mean , you know , we both could use some space .
right .
did i say something wrong ?
what ?
i &apos;m sorry . i couldn &apos;t hear you across all the space .
great news , um , jess is taking a shower .
okay , i just need , like , a good , solid ten minutes .
eat this granola bar first .
i want to try something called the horse trough .
no , cece .
i &apos;m not having sex with you right now .
i have to get everybody in the company &apos;s name
into a version of &quot; we didn &apos;t start the fire . &quot;
totally fine . what do you need , like , 20 minutes ?
cece , this ... okay , this is real work
for my real boss who is not you .
oh , i get what &apos;s happening here .
it &apos;s &apos; cause ponytail called you a &quot; sex receptionist . &quot;
a sex receptionist answers calls all day .
a sex @-@ cretary does scheduling , light filing ,
basically runs the office .
so , first of all ,
thank you for the demotion .
and second of all , i quit .
so , i &apos;ll see you tonight .
did you not hear anything i just said ?
oh , no , i totally heard you loud and clear , but
do you know who didn &apos;t happen to hear you ?
what are you doing ?
don &apos;t @-@ don &apos;t @-@ don &apos;t involve them .
oh , my ...
they just didn &apos;t hear .
don &apos;t bring them into this .
don &apos;t tell me .
tell them .
damn it .
i guess , uh , harold , kumar ,
i love ... i love you both .
all the zany adventures we &apos;ve had .
but we can &apos;t go to white castle today .
just can &apos;t do it .
you &apos;re serious about this ?
cece ?
is schmidt bothering you ?
this is not over . okay ?
was it like a caress or like a ... like a pat ?
no , like a pat . it was distinctly a pat ,
and it was actually kind of hot .
the man knows how to pat a back .
at any point during the night , did you do your kermit the frog imitation ?
maybe .
once or twice .
no , stop , it freaks me out and you know .
well , what do i do ?
i really , really want to see him again , like , badly .
you just call him .
i can &apos;t .
he &apos;s too sophisticated .
he told me he &apos;d run with the bulls ,
and i quote ,
&quot; not the touristy bulls in pamplona . &quot;
big deal . just call him .
schmidt says the moment a woman touches a phone ,
she loses her power unless she &apos;s sexting ,
in which case , she gains a half power .
okay , well , that &apos;s schmidt just talking ...
i mean , what does schmidt know ?
look , all the guys that you live with-- boys .
you &apos;ve only dated boys .
russell is a grown man ,
and i bet he likes women
who know what they want and ask for it .
he has a hot air balloon in a hangar in palm springs .
okay , sweetheart , you are sophisticated .
you &apos;ve just got to pick up the phone ,
and you ask him out for dinner .
you know what ? you &apos;re right . i am sophisticated .
i &apos;m gonna do this .
what is that ?
it &apos;s a phone .
oh , god .
and thus ends our journey through the words of time .
from dylan thomas to bob dylan ,
from dylan to dylan .
they &apos;re both named dylan .
watch him bring it home , man .
do i have to ?
&quot; we have to rage . &quot;
&quot; rage against the dying of the light . &quot;
&quot; and when the light is no longer bright . &quot;
&quot; don &apos;t think twice , it &apos;s all right . &quot;
it &apos;s over .
smartest guy i know .
professor ?
professor ?
yeah ?
we wanted to remind you about
the post @-@ lecture wine and cheese event .
a soiree , eh ?
super classy .
crackers , bubbles , crab , hummus .
yeah , i @-@ i e @-@ mailed you about that . that was me .
oh , sometimes when i get a really long e @-@ mail ...
i don &apos;t read it .
bye .
oh , mommy .
all right , dirk , what about deb ?
you guys having problems or something ?
no , no , no , everything &apos;s fine .
she left me and moved out of the house .
i guess it was &quot; too hard to support me . &quot;
&quot; financially . &quot;
it &apos;s all fine ; her leaving has allowed me to realize
the one thing that was missing in my life .
scarves ?
undergraduate ladies .
you see , girls our age , what do they want ?
they want us to wed them , sire their children .
they want you to have a @-@ a bedframe .
right , yeah .
they want you to eat off plates ,
but girls in college
all they want you to do
is tell them that their photography has potential .
yeah , but don &apos;t they want to hang out wth guys their own age ?
have you hung out with a 20 @-@ year @-@ old dude lately ?
trust me , they are setting the bar very , very low .
right .
they haven &apos;t even gone through their gay phase yet .
hey , man , i &apos;m gonna give shelby a call really quick .
just want to check on her , see if everything &apos;s all right .
sounds good , man .
what , dude , relax , okay ?
i just said we &apos;re gonna give each other space ,
doesn &apos;t mean i can &apos;t call her , right ,
to see if anything funny happened on the plane .
you know what &quot; space &quot; means , right ?
that &apos;s space to have sex with other people .
no , space means you go to mexico ,
and you do not have sex with other people .
watch this .
nick , don &apos;t give my any space .
you got it , my man .
see , this makes it pretty hard
for you and i to have sex right now , doesn &apos;t it ?
now , nick , i want you to give me some space .
you got it .
all this space allows me opportunity
to have as much sex as we want .
smartest guy i know .
see how much sex we could be having ?
that @-@ that does ...
get out of my way , bookworms !
you ready to make love to some college chicks ?
when &apos;s the last time you had mono ?
i don &apos;t know .
tomorrow , you &apos;re gonna say yesterday .
i have that team @-@ building research you asked for , mr. schmidt .
what ... are you wearing ?
i don &apos;t ... i don &apos;t know .
i mean , i found this at the lost and found at the gym .
i &apos;m not really sure how sexy a sex @-@ cretary is supposed to be .
i &apos;ve never had to do this .
i &apos;ve never had to seduce somebody before .
if you &apos;re gonna seduce me ,
don &apos;t dress up like my aunt frieda at seder .
come on , okay ?
i will do anything , and i &apos;ll do it anywhere .
all right ?
even fantasy location ...
number three ?
okay .
how good are the beatles ?
beatles are the best .
were you so upset when they broke up ?
i would have been , but i was one .
well , you &apos;re not one anymore .
how &apos;s your prostate ?
i had my breast exam last week ,
and , like , they &apos;re fine .
it &apos;s just boob in there ,
but we have to be careful .
our bodies are decaying .
are you okay ?
you seem strange .
why didn &apos;t we kiss the other night ?
sorry .
i &apos;m sorry .
no , it &apos;s fine .
what ?
hey , i ...
is everything okay ?
oh . i got to go .
this ought to take care of the dinner .
yeah .
okay ?
oh , i cannot believe i almost left without , um ...
here , there &apos;s cab fare .
get home safe .
baby , look , i don &apos;t want space , okay ?
i don &apos;t want anyone to have space .
i want to be standing right in front of you .
i want the air that you breathe
to be the air coming directly from out of my mouth .
i want to just be passing air back and forth
between each other until it &apos;s mostly carbon dioxide
and then we both pass out and die .
no flights tonight .
hey , schmidt , do you mind if i borrow your car again ?
&quot; of course you can , winston . you &apos;re so great . &quot;
thank you !
hey , my name &apos;s nicholas .
nick , nick .
buddy , nobody ever regretted throwing an after party .
oh , i do .
dirk , i feel so old here .
is calling a girl &quot; shorty &quot; still cool ?
we just got to find your angle with these college girls .
your hook , your panty @-@ melter .
usually , my hook is that it &apos;s closing time , and i &apos;m there .
you were a panty @-@ melting icon in law school .
if panties were snowmen ,
you were march , bro .
don &apos;t @-@ don &apos;t do this .
skyler , miriam ,
come over here for a second .
don &apos;t humiliate me , dirk .
how cool is my friend , nick ?
are you a professor , too ?
no , no , no , i &apos;m a bartender .
30 years old ,
i don &apos;t have health insurance .
you know how to make drinks ?
panty @-@ melter .
do i know how to make drinks , did you say ?
yeah , like alcoholic drinks ?
yeah , i do that professionally .
you could get me drunk professionally ?
are you a cop ?
sometimes .
do you have identification on you ?
i gotta call jenna
and tell her i &apos;m making out with a bartender .
five nights a week .
jess , you made it to the party !
what &apos;s going on ?
why is the cast of the social network in our apartment ?
dirk is a genius !
20 @-@ year @-@ old girls-- they think i &apos;m awesome !
and look at &apos; em !
they don &apos;t know what saved by the bell is
and they &apos;ve never felt pain .
i &apos;m skyler &apos;s fancyman !
can you believe it ?
where &apos;s your fancyman ? where is he ?
i don &apos;t know . it was horrible .
he left and gave me $ 100
for a cab !
you know what ?
i &apos;m gonna use the remaining 90
to get out of here and start a new life .
it &apos;s been nice knowing you .
i &apos;m gonna die alone !
oh , no !
i am so , so sad right now .
my heart hurts !
you want nick to make you a bayberry breeze ?
&apos;cause he is so smart .
so smart .
yes , i do . yes , i do !
this .
i &apos;m not happy ! 30 sucks !
weird party move .
it &apos;s been two hours .
this is officially crazy .
also , i have to go to the bathroom .
just pee yourself .
so you &apos;d rather sit in my urine
for the rest of the car ride
than admit to winston that we &apos;re sleeping together ?
yep , absolutely . don &apos;t even have to think about it .
i don &apos;t want to ruin what we have , okay ?
because if people find out ,
they &apos;re gonna have a lot of questions ,
like , &quot; cece , why are you sleeping with him ? &quot;
and , &quot; seriously , why ? &quot;
you think we have something to ruin ?
earlier , i was dressed as a sex @-@ cretary .
and i was wearing shoulder pads .
so i obviously
must like sleeping with you .
a secre @-@ tarty .
shut ... up .
this is pretty great .
i &apos;m freezing , by the way .
i &apos;m so cold .
how are you not freezing ?
do your brown skin retain heat ?
take out your tampon and drink , trevor !
the flip queen has spoken !
chug ! chug ! chug ! chug ! chug !
chug ! chug ! chug ! chug !
shelby .
babe , i don &apos;t want space .
neither do i !
that &apos;s why i &apos;m at your apartment .
i got on a plane . i wanted to see you .
what ? !
babe , look , i &apos;m in mexico . i came to see you .
are you serious ?
i miss you , shelby .
you &apos;re so sexy , girl .
in or out of the wig .
i don &apos;t care . shelby .
you make me so feel brave , babe ,
and i &apos;ve never felt like this about anybody else before .
i love you .
and i carry your soul @-@ song with me wherever i go .
i love you , too .
i &apos;m coming back , baby . no space !
are you traveling with any non @-@ us citizens ?
you actually catch people with that line ?
no , sir , just me and my american heart ...
full of love .
then how do you explain ...
this ?
i can &apos;t ... sir .
no one in the entire world can explain that .
i am so tall !
i feel like a chinese basketball player .
russell ?
hey , jess .
i &apos;m not jess .
i &apos;m her cousin ... sylvia .
are you doing okay ?
i want a donut .
then let &apos;s get you a donut .
please ?
i want to talk to you ... alone .
well , this is a fun group .
can you drop me off at my dorm ?
it &apos;s called hamilton .
i &apos;d like to vomit now .
god !
i &apos;ve never jumped out of a moving car before !
that was bad @-@ ass !
hey , uh , kiddo .
okay .
nick , that &apos;s the road .
what &apos;s up ?
you want the woods .
i want the woods . you &apos;re smart , russ .
come here .
hey , it was nothing .
you &apos;re okay , russ .
okay , we can hug some more later .
this isn &apos;t her , you know .
she &apos;s not like us .
she &apos;s one of the good ones .
time to make the puke , russell .
so listen , man , it &apos;s @-@ it &apos;s really important to us
that our completely equal sexual relationship
where neither one of us has the upper hand ,
uh , remain a secret , and while i respect the fact that
you listen to wicked while you &apos;re alone ,
i could use that information against you
at any point in time .
by the way , there &apos;s a stop sign , like , right up ...
is that a stop sign ?
well , you &apos;d probably want to slow down ...
oh , my god .
maybe it &apos;s a go sign .
i don &apos;t think it &apos;s a go sign .
because if somebody like you
is sleeping with someone like her ,
then maybe the whole damn world is upside down !
it &apos;s just what i &apos;m thinking .
and i want to talk to you .
i want to have a chance to explain .
that &apos;s okay . i understand .
i just ... i thought
you wanted a sophisticated lady , but now i realize that
you like dating younger girls &apos; cause we think you &apos;re cool .
and you know what ?
it &apos;s working because ...
i think you &apos;re a hotty with a body .
i got to tell you , i didn &apos;t ask you out
because you &apos;re younger than me .
i asked you out because i like you .
but i @-@ i &apos;ve forgotten really how ... how to do this , you know .
i haven &apos;t dated since 1989 ...
when i took her to the picture show in my buggy .
1989 was , my friend ,
the year that i learned to use the toaster by myself .
the text i got at dinner was from my ex @-@ wife .
sarah &apos;s with her this weekend .
i didn &apos;t pack her inhaler .
she was having an asthma attack .
is sarah okay ?
yeah .
yeah . thanks . i @-@ i ...
i just feel like i should have explained .
and i really wanted to kiss you
the other night .
really ?
i wanted to do more than kiss you .
i &apos;d like to do you , at some point .
like , you know , really ,
really give it to you good .
uh , but i &apos;ve forgotten how to tell
whether it &apos;s the right moment .
i was nervous .
you were nervous ?
nick was right .
he can be really wise sometimes .
oh , my god , it &apos;s happening !
it &apos;s coming ! i think i &apos;m dying !
i feel scared and excited !
what do you think ?
what do i think of what ?
do you think now is the right moment ?
i think so .
good .
get out of me , you poison !
is that your hand ?
no .
that &apos;s my hand .
oh my god !
you are welcome .
get out of here dirk .
where are you guys ?
hello ?
where are you guys ?
could i walk down to the mountains ?
when does the hill became a mountain ? it just happened .
i &apos;m so cold .
who is that ?
oh my god ! dirk is dead .
dirk is dead !
