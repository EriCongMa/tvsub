Good afternoon, Greendale community college.
I am your dean with a few corrections to the fall class catalog.
Cosmology should be cosmetology,
astrology should be astronomy,
and the students on the cover should be smiling,
but I suppose that's a matter of opinion.
Whoever is growing a small patch of cannabis behind the gymnasium,
congratulations. You have won a cruise.
Report to security to claim your tickets.
In order to increase awareness of homelessness,
security has been given binoculars.
In campus news,
the debate over our library's PA system continues
with some students suggesting its volume be lowered,
while others question its very purpose.
More on that story as it unfolds.
That dude makes a lot of announcements.
I like it,
it makes every ten minutes feel like the beginning of a new scene of a tv show.
Of course the illusion only lasts until someone says something they'd never say on tv
like how much their life is like tv. There, it's gone.
I guess Jeff's running late again.
What a shame. We should get started...
No no no, I think we should wait for Jeff before we start studying.
But maybe when Jeff gets here,
we could talk to him as a group about his tardiness.
Come on, don't use that word around Abed.
In any case, if you want me to have a chat with Jeff, I'd be happy to do it.
We've got a bond going, kind of. Sorta like brothers.
I hope your mom didn't make you take baths together '
cause one of you would've been like 30.
That's funny.
You know, Jeff probably comes late
so he doesn't have to sit through your tardiness.
Sorry. Abed.
Will you guys have some self respect?
You're obsessing over someone who does not give you a second thought.
Meanwhile, in Guatemala, journalists are being killed by their own government.
Maybe you're jumped a column. What's happening in Guatemala?
Nothing.
Journalists are being murdered?
Believe me, every day in that country, people are being killed for speaking out.
The worst part of it is when it's over...
Spoilers.
It's gonna be as if it would never even happened.
Abed.
Real stories... They don't have spoilers.
You understand that tv and life are different, right?
Milady.
Milord.
Baby.
Sweetie.
You smell nice. Vitamin P.
Morning, Jeffrey.
People were jazzed to see me too.
Word 'em up.
Word 'em everywhere.
Good entrance.
That was for you.
Thank you.
Britta.
Hey, Jeff.
I think there's something that the group would like to talk to you about.
Actually, there's nothing...
Okay, if you're gonna study with people,
it would be cool of you to show up on time.
Were you waiting?
No.
I just got here.
Cause you usually spend the first 20 minutes
talking about your interesting personal lives and your cool emotional problems.
I just feel I never have anything to offer.
No no, truth is my life is emptier than this three-ring binder.
Annie, do you have any Spanish notes that might fit in there?
Double-spaced. Thank you.
So, what's a guy got to do to get a C around here?
One-liner.
第一季 第二集
See you later. Bye.
You know what today is?
The two-week anniversary of my horrible first impression.
There's a card for that?
Not specifically,
but if you think of grandsons as a metaphor for friendship,
I think you'll agree with this transformer here
that it's time for ours to become a man.
By reading from the Torah.
Look, Jeff.
You're harmless enough to me cause a life full of ups and downs
has given me douche-ray vision, but those are good people in there,
and they trust and respect you. Watching you exploit them kind bums me out.
Exploit them? They're my friends.
You want me to bring your car around?
No, Abed.
I don't want you to bring my car around.
I'll bring yours around, good guy. You get going, all right.
You're cute,
but selfish and narcissistic to the point of near delusion.
She said I was cute.
Tell you what, you take her. I have less to prove.
You know, Jeff. You can't pursue people so desperately.
It starts to creep them out.
Why don't we go get a beer? I'll give you some advice,
and we can have what the kids calls a sausage fest.
I'm not much of a sausage guy, Pierce. Maybe next time.
Next time, then.
Britta, will you tell us more about Guatemala?
I never went to a real college. I want to be political.
That's good, you guys should discover that stuff on your own.
But we need your help.
We've been living on the wrong side of the looking glass.
You're like Jodie Foster or Susan Sarandon.
You'd rather keep it real than be likeable.
Can you at least tell us what to google?
You could start with this journalist Chacata-Panecos.
He wrote an article critical of the government, and they killed him.
That's horrible.
Can we have a protest?
I want to protest the hell out of something.
We could have a candlelight vigil
like lesbians have on the news.
I can make brownies.
Brownies?
Every once in a while, a student come up to me and ask,
"Senor Chang, why do you teach Spanish?"
They say it just like that.
"Why do you teach
Spanish?"
"Why you?"
Why not math?
Why not photography?
Why not martial arts?
I mean, surely it must be in my nature
to instruct you in something
that's ancient and secret
like building a wall that you can see from outer space.
I'll tell you why I teach Spanish.
It is none of your business, okay?
Now, I don't want to have any conversations
about what a mysterious and inscrutable man I am.
I am a Spanish genius!
In Espanol, my nickname is
"El tigre chino"!
'Cause my knowledge will bite her face off!
So don't question Senor Chang or you'll get bit.
Ya bit.
Ya bit!
Friday manana, we'll have conversations with the rest of the class
using some of the phrases we learned in unit one.
You'll be partnering up in pairs of dos.
So if you look under your desk,
you'll find a card with either a picture or a word on it.
For ejemplo, blondie aqui
has a card with a picture of a house on it.
So that means the person with the card with the word casa on it is her partner.
Comprende, Star-Burns?
Okay, see you Friday. Find your partners. Have a great day.
And what do we say at the end of every class?
Hasta luego.
Come on, hands... 90% of Spanish.
Hasta luego.
Excenlletn, excenlletn.
Abed, Abed.
You want to trade cards?
No.
I'll give you 20 bucks.
No.
50 bucks.
No, I don't want your money. I want Your shirt.
What?
I've had my eye on it since registration first day.
All right, fine. Give me your card.
I don't think you understand. I want to wear it out of here.
Thanks.
Gracias.
What are the odds?
Are you sure you didn't adjust the odds?
I know Abed's been eyeing that shirt for three weeks.
It's almost like you gave it to him so he would switch cards.
I gave Abed my shirt because I'm not selfish,
which is something I guess you'll finally discover
while we are working on this.
Tomorrow night? Dinner, drinks.
I think that's something we should discuss with our partners.
See, I did switch cards.
Can you believe this? What are the odds?
That's a nice shirt. Want to sell it?
Yes.
What's the moist towelette industry like?
Believe me, it's nothing like the product.
It's a hard, dry, large business.
Destroyed all my marriages.
Of course it didn't help I can't have children. I'm not sterile.
In fact, it's a rare condition they call "hyper-virility."
Apparently my sperm shoot through the egg like bullets.
Can you believe that?
I can't.
But you can, so that's fine.
So, the assignment is
to write a Spanish conversation using those five phrases.
Hemingway's lemonade.
We don't need to make it a long evening, we can just...
What am I? A piece of garbage to you?
What?
No.
Got ya. Come on,
let's have one drink before we work.
To the "empowerage" of words.
To the irony of that sentence.
So what's up with you, Jeffrey?
Seems like you got a burr up your ass or some.
Well, I guess that it's...
I think it's Britta.
Forget Britta.
All you have to know about her is her name. What is she, a water filter?
She's ugly.
Why don't we start with me saying...
What are you doing?
Our assignment.
No no no!
This is the first time people gonna see Winger and Hawthorne together.
We gonna show them we're a force to be reckoned with.
Come on, let's brainstorm some story ideas.
Better yet, before we do that, let's ask ourselves...
What is a story?
Oh my God in heaven.
If you like that brownie, you'll hate what's up on in Guatemala.
Tell you that. Google it.
Raise the truth.
Okay, once it gets dark,
I hand out the candles and we do it's called a speechless protest.
We put tape over our mouths,
and gather hand-in-hand in a sea of outraged silence.
Star-Burns, no.
Britta, what's got into you?
This is not how you do this.
We know it's not how you do it cause we're doing everything.
But this is tacky and lame.
I didn't mean that.
I didn't mean that. I'm sorry.
What I meant to say
is that this cause is really personal to me.
Are you saying that we're not allowed to protest?
Britta, you sound like Guatemala.
Sounds like somebody has a case of
"likes to use French politics to make themselves special,
"but doesn't actually ever want to do anything-itis."
No, I do things.
I went to...
I don't do anything.
What can I do?
You can hang the Chacata-Panecos pinata.
You guys realize he was beaten to death, right?
That's where we got the idea from.
Poignant.
All right.
Okay, tell me what I've got so far.
What we have so far?
We have something incredibly long,
and very confusing, and a little homophobic.
And really, really, specifically,
surprisingly, and gratuitously critical of Israel.
It's called "two conquistadors," should probably be "dos."
I mean, it is a Spanish class.
Which reminds me, the only thing not included in this
are the five phrases required to get me a passing grade.
You're right. Needs more work.
What're you guys doing?
I have no idea.
We head to the demonstration.
What? Hippies?
Some cause Britta's into.
A silent protest. Lots of candles.
Gets the ladies in the mood for social change if you know what I mean.
Good chance to put miles on this shirt.
You realize this conversations are due in the morning, don't you?
Right.
What do you want to do?
Hola, me llamo Abed.
Hola, me llamo Troy.
Donde esta la biblioteca?
La biblioteca esta en la ciudad.
Gracias.
Hacks.
Okay,
what do we do about the ending of act two?
I tell you what we're gonna do.
We gonna take this, and we gonna put it in a museum for crazy people.
Then we're gonna take this,
and memorize five phrases from it tomorrow morning before class.
Good night.
Wait a minute.
You're bailing on our first sausage fest?
This is your definition of friendship?
No, this is my definition of you trying way too hard,
and me finding it harder and harder to stay polite.
Now this was a fine enough way to spend an evening devoid of hope,
but the woman I kind of like
is out there in the moonlight caring about something stupid,
and this is my chance to show her that
I care enough to act like I care about too.
That's all you had to say. Jeff.
That was it?
That would've been great if I had done that two hours ago!
Nice sign.
Thanks.
I like what you've done with the place.
I think I was a little too harsh on you.
I'm not perfect.
I am. I'd be happy to show you the ropes.
Awesome!
Look at awesome Jeffrey Winger.
Too awesome for old Pierce
with your hip shirts,
and your gelled hair,
and your cool
tape over your mouth.
Why are you wearing tape over their mouth?
It's a protest, Pierce.
Good.
Cause I know what I'd like to protest...
How much you hurt me.
Conflicts like these will ultimately bring us together as an unlikely family.
You have horrible breath right now.
First, you constantly blow me off,
then you want me to do your homework,
Ok.
then you tell me I'm trying too hard to be your friend
so you have to go.
You have to come out here to pretend
to care about the stupid stuff she cares about.
His words, not mine.
He is paraphrasing.
Pierce, I got an idea.
Why don't you get a cup of coffee,
and hold some waitress hostage with a monologue about your sperm.
I'll show you some sperm, buddy.
Was this your idea? What the hell? Fire.
I'm not ready to die.
He's jumped in the fountain.
He's fine.
Have you seen it?
We did it, girl... Page three.
It's mostly about Pierce, but listen to last paragraph.
"The incident occurred during a protest regarding events in Guatemala."
Awareness!
It's not the school paper.
It's a real damn paper, there's a Marmaduke in there.
Well, it's more than I ever accomplished.
Did you guys know about the ethnic cleansing in Burma?
Need to bust out brownie mix.
Morning.
Morning.
No, I get it. Garfield's wishing me a happy Arbor Day,
you'd like a fresh start.
Nice try.
It's actually secretary's day, and it says I'm sorry
about crashing your protest
with that drunken, self-immolating baby boomer.
We don't blame you, sweety. Pierce has always been on my watch list.
That dude is crazy... He told me girls have two pee holes.
I sang Christmas carols at a nursing home once.
I've seen the face of dementia, and last night I saw it again.
You know what he did that's really crazy?
He offered me $100 to switch cards with him
just so he could be partners with Jeff.
I think he thought getting closer to Jeff
would bring him respect in the group.
I think he spent his whole life looking out for himself
and he would trade it all for a shot at some kind of family.
Hola class.
Hola.
Time for our presentations.
First up was supposed to be Jeff and Pierce,
but Pierce explained the situation to me.
Apparently there was a falling out,
things were said, people were betrayed.
Jeff, having heard Pierce's side of the story,
I think the only humane thing to do would be to give you a C
and let Pierce do his presentation alone,
if that sounds fair to you.
That doesn't sound fair to me at all.
Pierce, I understand if you don't want to be my friend,
but this thing we've created...
It is bigger than the both of us,
and it deserves to be done right.
Okay, guys.
Why are there costumes involved? These are short conversations,
they're not supposed to take...
Your breath away?
Well, tough.
You ready, amigo?
Si
F-minus.
What?
Did you say S?
So.
That was one of the worst things I have ever seen,
which I guess makes being a part of it a pretty selfless act,
so I'm impressed.
How do you know I didn't do it just to get another shot at you?
Cause a smart guy like you would know that
no woman in that class would be able to look at you
as a sexually viable candidate ever again.
No, I know.
I thought of that.
She looked back.
You did an all right job up there, my friend.
Thanks, Pierce.
Couple of notes, you got this thing you do with your face
when you're trying to be funny
that forces people to think about "how cool you think you are."
What? It's 2009.
