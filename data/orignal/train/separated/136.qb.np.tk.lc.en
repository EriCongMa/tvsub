oh , my god , that is so sultry ,
that is so essence of new orleans .
okay , mom , so what happened with your scam ?
oh , i don &apos;t want to talk about it .
that &apos;s the only reason we &apos;re here .
well , until about four minutes ago.- how much did you lose ?
i don &apos;t know . about $ 100,000 .
what ? you said $ 30,000 .
well , look , i didn &apos;t ask him to lose it .
he was going to invest it . and then i get ...
this letter .
gino davidson ?
yeah , yeah , what &apos;s ...
i mean , what &apos;s wrong with that ?
you know , it &apos;s very racist of you to think
there &apos;s something wrong with that name .
i thought david lee was investing for you .
did he connect you with this guy ?
no , not really .
didn &apos;t i say ?
yeah , but i didn &apos;t know how much to believe you .
you know , he can hear you , right ?
jason , this is my family .
my mother , veronica , and my brother , owen .
hi . nice to meet you .
i should get going .
no ! no !
have a bagel . we &apos;re hav-- we &apos;re having bagels .
it is sunday , right ?
yes . lot people want to see you , alicia .
you &apos;re popular .
well , jason has a very busy sunday ...
oh , no , no , no , no , no , no .
he &apos;s not leaving without a bagel , are you ? come on .
sure .
go get your door , we &apos;ll be fine .
we tried calling .
it &apos;s sunday .
i know .
this is mike tascioni .
and this is tom .
do you have a little water ?
who is it ?
it &apos;s not peter , is it ?
that would be awkward .
what is your mother doing here ?
nice apartment .
thanks .
eli , can we do this--
whatever this is-- another time ?
i wish we could .
mike is peter &apos;s new lawyer ,
and the grand jury starts tomorrow .
we think you &apos;ll be called .
did you get a subpoena ?
no .
well , you will .
but we need to ask a favor .
we want the grand jurors to see you there
as they enter and leave .
it &apos;ll make a difference if they see your support .
it &apos;ll humanize peter .
who did your interior design ?
the colors are really good .
tascioni ? are you ...
elsbeth &apos;s ex @-@ husband .
yes .
well , come on in .
we have bagels .
really ?
tom loves bagels .
it &apos;s all about the orgasm .
naomi wolf called it the goddess array .
thanks ...
mom .
you all right ?
i &apos;m great .
oh , hey ... jason .
eli .
here we are again .
so why isn &apos;t anybody at church ?
what do you mean ?
it &apos;s sunday .
we &apos;re all here .
and not at church .
that &apos;s a good point .
i go to church sunday nights .
really ?
yeah .
greek orthodox . why ?
well , i would imagine that would come as a surprise
to my daughter .
my money &apos;s on peter .
not funny .
okay . i &apos;ll get that .
alicia florrick ?
would you believe no ?
you &apos;ve been served .
come on in !
we &apos;ve got bagels !
okay !
eli gold . how are you ?
good . do i know you ?
you don &apos;t . connor fox . i &apos;m from l.a.
i &apos;m prosecuting your client .
my client ? governor florrick ?
so you &apos;re admitting you are prosecuting him .
well , i &apos;m here in a grand jury room
with 16 upstanding citizens thinking about it .
maybe you &apos;d like to tell me what you &apos;re thinking
of prosecuting him for .
what would be the fun in that ?
it &apos;s our only element of surprise , isn &apos;t it ?
you have to figure out , of all the dozens of cookie jars
governor florrick has his hand in , which one we &apos;ve caught .
hello .
hello . mike tascioni .
and you &apos;re ...
peter florrick &apos;s lawyer .
well , that &apos;s an ...
interesting way to go .
nice dog .
thank you . his name is tom .
oh . hello , tom . hey , buddy .
is he a service dog ?
yes .
good to know .
so , what are we doing here ?
lawyering by loitering ?
yes .
really ?
yes , since you won &apos;t tell us why you &apos;re targeting the governor ,
we &apos;re going to question the witnesses as they leave .
they won &apos;t talk to you .
then we &apos;ll time the duration of each witness &apos; questioning
to determine which witnesses
you &apos;re bringing as smoke screens and ...
which go to the heart of the case .
mike , mike , i don &apos;t think it &apos;s a good idea to ...
and why won &apos;t i just stretch out the amount of time
i question the smoke screens ?
because you can &apos;t .
try stretching out ten minutes &apos; worth of questions to one hour .
seems doable .
yes , if you don &apos;t mind
angering your grand jury by wasting their time .
hello , mrs. florrick .
hello .
i didn &apos;t think your subpoena was for today .
it isn &apos;t .
we wanted your jurors to see her out here supporting her husband .
well , that is a strategy .
oh , and here they come .
thanks . come on in , guys .
you sure you don &apos;t mind being here all day , mrs. florrick ,
to support your husband ?
no , not at all .
it &apos;s not gonna make a difference .
hello ? david , yes .
is my mother there ?
hi , alicia . i &apos;m here .
we &apos;ve already discussed that veronica made a mistake
going out on her own with this investment .
yes , i &apos;ve been properly spanked .
and i &apos;m asking our investigator
to step in to look into this investor &apos;s scam .
ooh , the investigator .
okay . i &apos;ll be right back .
hey , mom ?
did david just step out ?
yes , he did .
owen &apos;s here .
owen ? why is owen there ?
uh , because i &apos;m supposedly good at math .
yes , everyone blames me .
i guess i need a minder now .
moi .
okay , look , guys , i don &apos;t want my
workmates to know about my personal life ,
so can we not mention jason at my house ?
alicia , please , i &apos;m not a dummy .
we already discussed it . oh , here @-@ here he is now .
ah . this must be our investigator .
hey , jason . hi .
alicia just , uh , told us your name , jason .
wasn &apos;t that right , alicia ?
yes .
hello .
you &apos;ve been the victim of a pyramid scheme ?
is that alicia ?
yes .
we should talk to her now .
alicia , do you mind ?
uh , we have to talk to you a minute about firm business .
okay .
what are you doing ? your office .
no , your office .
diane will see us in my office .
yes . and that &apos;s what we want .
alicia , we &apos;re worried diane is making a power play for the firm .
yes , i &apos;ve heard about your concern , cary ,
but i think it &apos;s just paranoia .
diane hasn &apos;t reached out to you to join her ?
join her in what ?
in an all @-@ female partnership .
look , you &apos;re the one who brought me into the firm , cary .
i &apos;m a nonequity partner . i don &apos;t mean anything .
it &apos;s not about your position .
it &apos;s about your connections and your last name .
we think that diane might try to use you
as a lure to female @-@ leaning clients .
are you hearing this from diane ?
no . we &apos;re hearing it from clients .
and you &apos;re not denying it .
then i &apos;m denying it .
diane hasn &apos;t approached me .
she &apos;s lying .
then what do we do ?
put her on the hot seat .
tell her if diane approaches her , she has to talk to us .
still there ?
okay , but she hasn &apos;t approached me .
okay , guys , uh , i have to go . but , yes ,
i &apos;ll let you know if diane approaches me .
eli .
don &apos;t tell me you made a deal .
alicia , hello .
ruth . you made a deal .
eli , this isn &apos;t the place .
oh , yes , this is the place .
this is exactly the place .
do you know what this does to my resume ?
i &apos;m being subpoenaed . the last thing i need
is to be testifying against a client .
which is what you &apos;re doing ?
i &apos;m answering questions , eli .
same as you . same as anyone .
hi . mike tascioni .
and this is tom .
hello .
she made a deal .
i didn &apos;t make a deal .
we &apos;re ready for you , ms. eastman .
you testify against peter , no one will ever hire you again
and you know it .
how can she hurt us ?
in ways i can &apos;t even imagine .
who is it ?
i &apos;m looking for gino davidson .
hey . i &apos;m gino .
should i know what this is about ?
does the name veronica loy ring a bell ?
oh , geez ...
i like veronica .
she always sat in the front row of my class .
what class ?
fire cycle . i teach monday , wednesdays ,
and some fridays to pay the rent ,
while i day @-@ trade and study up for my series 7 .
so you day @-@ traded away veronica &apos;s $ 100,000 ?
no . is that what she told you ?
no . she told me you promised to double her money .
no way , man . i did the opposite of promise her .
i told her it was a high risk investment .
what was ?
i have a cousin that got in early
on riverboat casinos , made a killing .
so when he told me he was gonna do a second round ,
i put a little of my own money in .
risk capital . part of a ...
smart asset allocation .
i mentioned it to veronica . she said she wanted in .
but that didn &apos;t pan out ?
let &apos;s just say i &apos;m not gonna
be hanging up my bike shorts anytime soon .
i was very clear with veronica about what she was getting into .
look , i &apos;m telling you the truth .
hey . i &apos;m sorry you got saddled with all of this .
uh , it &apos;s all right . but this guy seems to be telling the truth .
he &apos;s an idiot but not necessarily a con man .
so you &apos;re asking if my mother is dumb enough
to give $ 100,000 to an idiot ?
not dumb enough . just whether ...
yes , well , she is .
all right , well ,
i @-@ i don &apos;t really think there &apos;s an issue here then .
it &apos;s not a madoff situation .
it &apos;s just a bad investment .
okay . i &apos;ll talk to my mom .
no , don &apos;t worry about it . you know what ,
i got to tell david lee , so i &apos;ll talk to her .
how are you doing , by the way ?
good .
wait , which subject ?
our lost weekend .
good .
i needed to clear my head .
and we didn &apos;t even drink .
we didn &apos;t .
sex is a good replacement for tequila .
it can be .
i wish you were here right now .
where &apos;s here ?
handicapped bathroom in the federal building .
you know , i think i wrote a penthouse letter
about something like that .
okay . i &apos;d better go . take care .
an example of what you mean by that .
they &apos;re not clean and pure .
no one is suggesting governor florrick is pure .
i did my due diligence
before joining . that wasn &apos;t surprising .
perhaps not to you .
a grand jury might be surprised to learn
some of these things about governor florrick .
what things about governor florrick ?
let &apos;s turn to the events of november . you were ...
i ...
eli , can i talk to you for a minute ?
sure .
do you mind ?
i &apos;m a lawyer . and mike is a lawyer .
i can &apos;t get too involved in ... this .
wh @-@ what is this ?
uh ... alicia ...
alicia , this is ...
shut up .
i think bringing me in
implies something very smart about ...
is this the grand jury ?
i can &apos;t say anything .
i &apos;m a lawyer , and i &apos;ve been subpoenaed .
but i am hearing the grand jury room ?
you found this on your own .
it &apos;s not illegal for you to listen .
it is illegal for me .
oh , my god , you &apos;re great .
good @-@ bye .
eli gold , bless his heart ...
... now is the time to put it in the ...
no , no , can &apos;t .
all right , so put it over there , huh ?
yeah , we got a lot of work to do .
how many of these things do we got to do ... ?
we got to fix that ...
... might have acquired a quick infusion of cash .
he did .
and did lloyd garber provide that money ?
he bundled it for us , yes .
and you had struggles with eli gold , too , didn &apos;t you ?
eli gold had some issues with me
because i replaced him as campaign manager .
well , let &apos;s talk about eli gold for a second .
candidates don &apos;t come into your life like newborn babies .
they &apos;re not clean and pure . certainly not peter florrick .
my question was
whether you ever heard him agree to a quid pro quo .
every candidate gets asked favors .
comes with the territory .
but i never saw or heard governor florrick cross a line .
good lord .
thank you , ms. eastman .
let &apos;s turn to the question of donuts .
okay . which one ?
lloyd garber .
he was one of governor florrick &apos;s top donors , yes ?
yes , that is true .
in fact , wasn &apos;t lloyd garber the single largest donor
to governor florrick &apos;s presidential campaign ?
yes , he donated money , organized fund @-@ raisers .
and they had conversations you weren &apos;t privy to ?
of course . donors on that level get a lot of access .
did governor florrick ever mention a falling out or
a period of friction ?
with mr. garber ? no .
did mr. garber mention it ?
no .
just to be clear ,
he never mentioned any trouble in 2012 ?
i never heard of any .
he didn &apos;t mention peter
prosecuting his illegitimate ...
that would be no . i don &apos;t know anything about that .
uh @-@ huh . but you would expect that situation
to drive a wedge between mr. garber and governor florrick .
he wasn &apos;t governor florrick at that time .
yes , of course . state &apos;s attorney florrick .
you would expect support to be cut off ...
but it wasn &apos;t .
in fact , mr. garber started bundling even larger amounts .
it &apos;s occupied ! try the next one !
damn it !
okay , i have something to tell you ,
and i can &apos;t tell you how i know it .
why ?
i just can &apos;t . mike !
why ?
you &apos;re both lawyers , i &apos;m not , but it is my understanding
that what they &apos;re discussing in that room
is an event that took place in 2012 .
that &apos;s very specific .
what event in 2012 ?
i &apos;m not sure , but i know
it has to do with lloyd garber .
so we think this is about corrupt fund @-@ raising practices ?
yes .
is there anything there ?
i don &apos;t know .
i know what i did . i ... don &apos;t know what peter did .
mrs. florrick ?
i don &apos;t know . you &apos;d have to talk to peter .
and we have no hint as to what this event is in 2012 ?
well , maybe you can go and find out more , eli .
oh , right . uh , yes .
think there &apos;s something here that i don &apos;t want to know about ?
i think you might be right .
is it illegal or unethical ?
i ... don &apos;t know anymore .
mrs. florrick .
oh , mister ... is it still hlavin ?
sure . just to keep things easy .
mr. hlavin .
and are we admitting we &apos;re an fbi agent today ?
why not ?
mr. tascioni ,
this is roland hlavin . he &apos;s an fbi agent
who keeps things interesting .
nice to meet you .
i guess you &apos;re the next witness .
i think i am .
and do you know what this is all about ?
i think it &apos;s a grand jury investigation .
and it &apos;s focusing on 2012 ?
what ?
2012 . that &apos;s what this is about , right ?
what are you talking about ?
the events in 2012 with lloyd garber .
it was completely innocent .
who told you this has anything to do with 2012 ?
where &apos;d you hear that ? did connor say something ?
he did .
and you should tell him that we &apos;re prepared to show
that this is a witch hunt ?
even the payoff ?
yes , even the payoff .
okay , great . bring your worst .
nice to meet you .
nicely done .
is there a payoff ?
i have no idea .
you &apos;ll need to refute it in your testimony .
what is eli doing ?
we have to get an investigator on this .
that would be good . do you have someone in mind ?
unfortunately , you weren &apos;t cheated , veronica .
says him .
yes , but also , those papers that you signed .
but if i was cheated , those papers shouldn &apos;t count .
you weren &apos;t cheated , mom .
i was .
i mean , they make the print so small ,
and they trick you with the language .
and i mean , who reads all that ?
you invested in a riverboat casino ?
he said that the only person who comes out ahead in gambling
is the house .
you don &apos;t believe me , do you ?
but he cheated me .
this is just like that last time , mom .
that guy who got you to give him your social security number ?
he said you were in trouble .
i couldn &apos;t get a hold of you .
so the money &apos;s gone ?
well , pretty much . you still have some investment money .
not enough to pay off mom &apos;s mortgage ?
we &apos;ll see .
i did nothing wrong here .
i was cheated .
this other guy that got her social security number--
when was that ?
last year .
we worked it out . he never got any money .
do you remember the month ?
why ?
i need to check out something .
is it something that will get her money back ?
i don &apos;t know .
february ? around my birthday .
hey .
hi . i was just coming to talk to you .
where you going ?
to find your mother .
okay , not what i expected .
do you have a minute ?
yeah .
would you be offended if i said i want to take you right now ?
no .
so , anyway ,
um , are you still freelance ?
i am . what do you need ?
it &apos;s not for me .
i hope this isn &apos;t too weird for you .
it &apos;s for your husband .
how did you know ?
that look on your face .
well , we think this grand jury investigation is about something
that happened in 2012 involving lloyd garber .
that &apos;s all we know .
can you find out more ?
i can try .
and this is okay with you ?
it &apos;s just work .
hey , and what &apos;s going on with my mom ?
i thought that was over .
it was .
but i just found out she &apos;s on the sucker &apos;s list .
it &apos;s a list of people that have fallen for scams .
con men trade and sell them .
so , she was cheated ?
it &apos;s possible ,
but the con man covered his tracks ,
so , we have to create new ones .
here , let me help you .
oh , god .
okay , i &apos;d like to turn ...
strike that .
was there a task force in place
to investigate governor florrick ?
no . this began as an investigation into corruption
in the cook county judiciary .
well , without compromising your other investigation ,
tell us what turned your attention to governor florrick .
well , it started as a chance comment by an informant .
and what was that ?
we were working undercover at the time
when a judge we had turned told us about a case ...
hey , what are they doing with the drywall here ?
what &apos;d you say ?
what are they doing with the drywall here ?
i don &apos;t know . they haven &apos;t said anything about it .
what do we do ? just leave it ?
i would .
they always get pissed if we think for ourselves .
i know , but check this out .
and in this context , what does certain mean ?
well , you can &apos;t just go on the testimony of
one guy you &apos;ve already rolled up .
what about this ? huh ? what about this ?
hey , hold on a second !
hold on a second !
oh , come on . come on !
wait . what ?
i &apos;m not sure if this is the right wall .
are we on the right wall here ?
v @-@ lock .
he &apos;s gonna take another ten hours ...
are you certain that was a result of corruption ?
governor florrick committed a crime then ?
yes . it &apos;s extremely unlikely it was a coincidence .
that &apos;s not how politics works ,
not how chicago works .
no , no . this is the right wall .
are you sure ?
yeah .
it &apos;s about v @-@ lock .
v ... ?
lock . this investigation is about v @-@ lock .
what &apos;s v @-@ lock ?
i have no idea .
sorry , i wish i could help , but just don &apos;t know how .
give my mom her money back .
i lost $ 80,000 myself .
it was everything that i saved .
you lost her $ 100,000 .
it wasn &apos;t even hers to invest .
owen , he already told me .
mom , i don &apos;t care what he told you ...
it was a risky investment .
i told her .
owen , i told you .
this isn &apos;t going to work .
we &apos;ll just invest it somewhere else .
all right , fine , we &apos;ll call him .
wait , invest what somewhere else ?
oh . oh , that &apos;s all right .
it &apos;s just that we need a more certain investment .
i have more certain investments .
veronica , i told you , this was one of the riskiest ,
with the highest yield .
yeah , but since she lost half her savings ,
she needs a higher yield .
wait , so how much do you have to invest ?
my husband &apos;s pension .
$ 90,000 .
but we need a certain investment .
i have some options .
listen ...
how &apos;d it go ?
i think i was pretty damn convincing .
my husband &apos;s pension .
i &apos;ve got to invest it .
he bit ?
hard .
hello ?
hey , alicia .
oh , tell her what we did .
actually , we have another issue .
we think this grand jury investigation
might have something to do with v @-@ lock .
v @-@ what ? what is that ?
v @-@ lock . we don &apos;t know what it is .
how was it used ?
i don &apos;t know . just the issue is v @-@ lock .
what about state of illinois v. lock .
that sounds interesting .
we need to look into if there is a people v. lock .
all right , i &apos;m on it .
aren &apos;t you going to tell her what we did ?
we kicked ass , alicia .
i &apos;m so glad .
i @-@ i have to go .
do you have a minute , alicia ?
sure .
uh , it &apos;s been a bit of a ride , hasn &apos;t it ?
i know we &apos;ve had some tense moments , but ...
i &apos;m very glad you &apos;re back home .
i am , too .
good .
things are finally settling down .
cary thinks you want to take over the firm
with female partners .
is that true ?
no .
a year ago you asked me ,
why not make it an all @-@ female firm ?
i know .
but you &apos;ve changed your mind ?
i have become , uh ,
more temperate .
but what is it that you want ?
i want to be of use .
no , you don &apos;t , alicia .
i &apos;ve watched you over the years .
you hide your ambition under a bushel ,
but it is a very bright lamp .
i was very happy on my own .
i &apos;m very happy here .
you may be suspicious of me ,
but all i want is to be of use .
i &apos;m not suspicious of you .
i want to join forces with you .
uh , could you give us a minute ?
i &apos;ve been working with cary now as a fellow name @-@ partner
for a year .
he &apos;s learned a lot , i respect him a great deal ,
but he is no will gardner .
he doesn &apos;t pretend to be .
you don &apos;t either , but you fill his shoes .
you can slice an opponent to shreds ,
smiling the whole time ,
and they come back , thanking you .
i want someone i can work across from who ...
who i can respect , who i think can outrace me .
cary is not that person .
and anyone who &apos;s not that person is holding us back .
so you &apos;re a woman ,
i &apos;m a woman .
what are you proposing ?
i &apos;m proposing that we work together , that &apos;s all .
to push cary out ?
to buy him out ... eventually .
this is not about a take over .
this is a way to sharpen our advantage .
there will be a winnowing among law firms in chicago .
it &apos;s happening already .
we need to make ourselves even more relevant .
you and i can do that .
what do you say ?
shall we eat ?
i need a word .
yes .
who was richard locke ?
the people v. locke .
you were the prosecutor .
i was on the team , but i rode the bench .
matan was lead . why ?
was it a murder trial ?
yeah . the kid , richard locke ,
was accused of murdering his girlfriend &apos;s ex .
he claimed it was an accident .
was it ?
unclear . the case ended in a mistrial . why ?
was there anything unusual about the case ?
well , the defendant , locke , was young , working class ,
but he had an amazing defense team .
who paid for that ?
we didn &apos;t do a source of funds ,
but there was a rumor that his father
was someone who mattered .
are you going to tell me what this is about ?
is there any chance his father was ... ?
no , we have to stop talking .
you &apos;ll be subpoenaed about what i just asked ,
and i will be about what you said ,
so i am ending this .
oh , hey , i &apos;m heading out . what &apos;s up ?
sorry , i gotta rush off .
i &apos;d love to talk .
how about later tonight ?
now . now &apos;s good .
why , what do you need ?
so how would this deal work ?
if mom pays you the $ 90,000 , how is it more secure ?
because it &apos;s government guaranteed .
that &apos;s like uncle sam insuring your cash .
and we can still get a 14 % yield ?
that &apos;s the beauty of it .
really ?
the beauty of it .
that &apos;s illegal-- illinois is a two party state .
you can &apos;t use that in a court of law .
i don &apos;t plan on using it in a court of law .
then how do you plan on using it ?
that depends on where veronica &apos;s money is .
i don &apos;t understand .
is it always like this here ?
pretty much .
diane thinks the firm needs to be defined .
it needs an identity .
she &apos;s not wrong .
all @-@ service firms tend to do too much .
no one knows what they &apos;re about .
so an all @-@ women firm .
does anybody want an all @-@ women firm ?
an all @-@ women partner firm .
some people do .
some people think they know what they &apos;re buying into
with a female lawyer .
softer .
more hand @-@ holding .
i know , but what do you think ?
do we get paid more money ?
i would .
oh , great .
you probably would , too .
i like cary .
i like cary , too .
but ...
but what ?
no , it just seems like you were going to add a but .
no , it &apos;s just , before i left here ,
jason wanted me to be name partner .
jason ?
i mean , will .
that was weird .
will .
so , jason , huh ?
what ?
jason .
you having a good time together ?
we &apos;re just ... nothing .
so what do you think i should do ?
do i go with diane ?
or ...
do i tell cary and david lee
that she approached me ?
tell cary .
really ?
really .
okay .
i &apos;m turning my brain off .
i &apos;m going home .
you want to get a drink ?
no , i &apos;m too tired .
next time .
long day .
mmm ... let &apos;s make it longer .
thank you for helping out today .
mmm , no problem .
damn it .
just ignore it .
alicia , it &apos;s your mom !
oh , come on .
it &apos;s not for you . it &apos;s for jason .
i want to thank him .
that &apos;s my mom .
get inside !
don &apos;t let him in !
alicia ?
