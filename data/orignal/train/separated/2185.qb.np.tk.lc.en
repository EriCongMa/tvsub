i got you . i got you , sweetie .
it &apos;s gonna be all right . it &apos;s all right .
been a few weeks now since the last one .
beginning to think maybe she &apos;s ready to get past it ,
but last night , man , it just ...
it was awful .
another nightmare , huh ?
yeah .
the whole thing-- the abduction ...
and being locked up in a cage ...
and watching ian die and ...
it just plays over and over on a loop in her head .
and she can &apos;t ... it just never ends .
that son of a bitch ian , man .
he really got under my daughter &apos;s skin .
she can &apos;t shake it .
yeah .
we both know what it &apos;s like not to want to close your eyes .
only cure for that though is time .
this is killing me .
i feel utterly helpless .
every night , i pray to god to take this thing off of her
and put it on me &apos; cause i can handle it .
this is my little girl .
she shouldn &apos;t have to carry this .
you know what though , lou ? let me tell you something .
you &apos;re doing the only thing you can do .
you &apos;re being there for samantha .
knowing she &apos;s got a father that loves her
and will do whatever it takes to keep her safe ...
that &apos;s exactly what she needs right now .
fool !
you &apos;ve fallen right into my trap !
without you to protect them ,
the people of earth will perish !
you better get in there and help save gotham .
carpool &apos;s gonna be here in ten minutes .
all right , you two warriors ! let me see this !
let &apos;s go , supermen .
to school !
capes down , brush your teeth ,
grab your backpacks .
i really appreciate you rearranging your day like this .
i know it &apos;s a pain .
comes with the territory when
you are married to a real superhero .
i &apos;ll make it up to you tonight .
i promise .
you always do .
i ...
not negotiable .
you have a long day of surgery ahead .
love you .
i love you , too .
i wish you could babysit me every day , poppy .
i wish i could , too , kiddo .
are you gonna be here after school ?
oh , you better believe it .
um , your parents get home around dinner time , eh ?
what do you say we take them to j.j. dolan &apos;s for some pizza ?
cool .
we &apos;re gonna have fun , poppy .
we sure will .
be a good boy .
you , too .
is the patient prepped ?
yes .
okay , go ahead and place an a line and a central line
before he goes into the o.r.
copy that .
yes , and then we can put the ventricular drain
to stabilize the intracranial bleeding .
how far out are you ?
i &apos;ll be up in a minute .
i &apos;m pulling into the garage now .
dig deep . you got this .
keep breathing . okay ?
just a little further .
all right , push yourself now . push yourself .
straight away , push yourself .
go , grace ! go !
go ! push yourself , grace !
that &apos;s it .
that right there is what we call
a six @-@ minute , 18 @-@ second mile .
that president &apos;s physical fitness medal is in the bag .
you hear me ?
good , &apos; cause i didn &apos;t do so hot last year .
forget about last year .
this year &apos;s gonna be different .
thanks for helping me , uncle steve .
danno says the only thing he hates
more than swimming is running .
don &apos;t worry about danno .
you know , it scares me to think
what that guy &apos;s gonna be like
when he actually is a grumpy old man .
i know .
that looks just like your car , uncle steve .
because it is my car .
listen to me , you don &apos;t ... you don &apos;t move from this spot .
okay ? you don &apos;t talk to anybody ...
okay , i won &apos;t .
don &apos;t move , all right ?
i won &apos;t , i won &apos;t . i promise . go !
son of a bitch !
son of a bitch .
mcgarrett .
all right , i &apos;m on the way .
hey . hey , hey , hey , hey ! don &apos;t hang up .
i need to report a stolen car .
it &apos;s mine .
let me ask you a question .
okay ? at what point
did you think that it was a good idea to leave
my innocent 12 @-@ year @-@ old daughter alone
in a ... in a deserted street by herself ?
when did you think that was okay ?
good morning . i &apos;m fine .
how are you though ?
no .
no , no , no , no . don &apos;t do that , okay ?
answer the question .
what ?
it &apos;s not like i left her in the middle of makaha .
oh , right , right .
because deviants and nutjobs
and psychopaths , they only hunt victims
in @-@ in high @-@ crime neighborhoods . is that right ?
she was never in any danger , danny .
i left for , like , not even five minutes .
okay ? i mean ...
you &apos;re overreacting like usual .
excu ... i &apos;m overreacting ?
yeah , you &apos;re over ...
i &apos;m sorry i don &apos;t obsess
over every possible worst @-@ case scenario in life .
no , no . you obsess over a death trap on wheels .
you know what ? that car is a classic .
mind yourself .
oh , please .
with the sales pitch . it &apos;s a classic piece of junk , that car .
you know what that car means to me .
do you not ?
all right , don &apos;t do that , okay ?
you do something wrong ,
and then somehow you turn it around and i &apos;m the bad guy .
you are the bad guy .
you can &apos;t see how you &apos;re the bad guy in this ?
no , i don &apos;t .
you guys still seeing that therapist ?
all right , you need a few more sessions .
our victim &apos;s name is dr. christine dupont .
she &apos;s a chief neurosurgeon on staff here .
she was called in this morning on her day off
to perform an emergency surgery .
not only did the shooter
know the doctor &apos;s schedule ,
he also knew the entire hospital security system layout .
he managed to get in and out of here
without once getting his mug picked up on camera .
commander , you might want to take a look at this .
fell out of the doctor &apos;s clothing .
it looks like a through @-@ and @-@ through .
copper @-@ jacketed .
probably nine @-@ millimeter semi @-@ auto .
no shell casings found at the scene .
shooter must have policed his own brass .
this was a well @-@ planned hit .
who puts a hit out on a brain surgeon ?
this might explain it .
dr. dupont was brought in to operate on paul delano .
who in the hell is that ?
he &apos;s a , um , organized crime guy
that we have a bad history with .
he was brought in this morning from halawa prison ,
and according to the warden , he went to the infirmary
last night complaining of a severe headache .
the cat scan showed a slow @-@ leaking brain aneurysm ,
but because of the delicate location of the hemorrhage ,
dr. dupont was the best chance they had
of saving delano &apos;s life .
looks like somebody didn &apos;t want that to happen .
gang intel in halawa has an informant in general pop
who says that delano has been bragging about
running his o.c. operations from inside the prison .
well , the easiest place to get him would have been from inside ,
so that kind of rules out other inmates .
mm @-@ hmm . and the prison ward here is well protected .
taking out a surgeon from the parking garage
was a much easier play .
you know , could be a rival crew on the outside
looking to take out some competition .
yeah , or it could &apos;ve been one of delano &apos;s crew
trying to move up the chain of command .
anyway , this guy &apos;s got no shortage of enemies .
so that info on our vic coming in
to perform a surgery on her day off ,
that had to come from someone on the hospital staff
or someone inside delano &apos;s inner circle .
yep , i agree with you .
that &apos;s the only way that hit could have been
pulled off as quickly as it was .
mm @-@ hmm . i had hpd put a protection detail
on the surgeon who came in to replace dr. dupont .
well , well , well .
if it isn &apos;t lieutenant chin ho kelly ,
as i live and breathe .
yeah , well , hopefully , that won &apos;t be for too much longer .
how &apos;s what &apos;s left of the family ?
keep talking , all right ?
i &apos;m gonna do these nice people a favor and open up
that big head of yours before you get in the o.r.
what &apos;s going on here ?
this man &apos;s about to go into surgery .
doc , i &apos;d like you to meet two of my dearest of friends .
this is steve mcgarrett and chin ho kelly .
they &apos;re two of five @-@ o &apos;s finest .
my brother murdered kelly &apos;s wife two years ago ,
he &apos;s still sore about it .
go figure .
hey , doc , we &apos;re gonna need another minute with this guy .
he doesn &apos;t have another minute .
this man needs an operation now or he could die .
in that case , we need five more .
if you delay him , and he dies ,
that &apos;s murder .
i think it &apos;s best if you wait outside .
right now , let &apos;s go .
i like your style , boys .
as charming as ever .
what &apos;d i just tell you before ?
i told you to shut up , all right ?
your surgeon
was assassinated in the parking lot this morning .
we think it was to take you out by proxy .
now you pay attention !
are you serious ?
do you actually think we want to be here talking to you ?
wh @-@ who do you think is behind it ?
well , that was my next question for you .
i mean , you &apos;re the one who &apos;s been
shooting your mouth off in halawa ,
talking about running your shop from the inside .
why don &apos;t we start with the people
who have more to gain from seeing you dead than alive .
present company excluded .
all right . all right .
the only thing i &apos;ve been running the joint is my mouth .
i &apos;m broke ,
and there &apos;s no organization left .
but as long as those animals
think that i got some kind of juice on the outside ,
that &apos;s what keeps me alive in that hellhole .
now , this lady doc ,
i understand she was my best shot at getting out of here alive .
if i knew who was trying to whack me , i would tell you ,
but not because i like you .
because if i have to go back to halawa ,
i &apos;m not gonna be that hard to find .
your minute &apos;s up .
this is absolutely outrageous .
you know , kelly ,
if i do happen to make it out ,
i would be very , very interested
in seeing you again on the outside sometime .
you know where to find me .
oh , you bet your ass i do .
uh , but , uh ...
should i not make it ,
i &apos;ll be sure to say hello to your wife for you .
who would want to kill christine ?
well , at first we believed it was to prevent her
from operating on a convict who had a lot of enemies .
but we &apos;ve since found out that &apos;s not the case .
it just doesn &apos;t make any sense .
did you notice any unusual behavior
from your wife recently ?
uh , she stayed late at the office
a couple of nights last week .
she said she had to check on some ...
something personal for a patient .
did she happen to say what that is ?
mr. dupont , are you sure that
your wife didn &apos;t mention anything about this ?
even the smallest thing can be important .
no .
i @-@ i &apos;m sorry .
w @-@ with two kids and both of us working full @-@ time ,
we barely saw each other during the week ,
and when we did , we @-@ we really
tried not to talk shop .
she was gonna fill me in this weekend .
w @-@ we had plans to take the boys to the beach .
what do i tell them ?
recognize this theme ?
i didn &apos;t think so .
it &apos;s &quot; merry widow &quot;
from alfred hitchcock &apos;s
shadow of a doubt ,
written by dimitri tiomkin , 1943 .
considered one of the greatest psychological thrillers of all time .
ah , very nice , very nice .
is that why we were here , max , for movie trivia ?
just setting the mood .
oh , that &apos;s nice .
this man was brought in from the icu
of the kuakini medical center last night
for a routine clinical autopsy .
he was recently diagnosed with terminal brain cancer
while incarcerated in the oahu correctional .
they deemed the tumor to be inoperable ,
so they sent him to the icu last week
for end @-@ of @-@ life care .
okay , that &apos;s a good story , max .
what does it have to do with her murder ?
ah , in usual form , detective ,
you &apos;ve managed to trample on the punch line .
as i was about to say , before i was so rudely interrupted ,
was that dr. dupont was also mr. tahni &apos;s surgeon .
okay , well , i &apos;m sure , max ,
that she operated on many patients .
tahni had a brain tumor .
she &apos;s a neurosurgeon .
that &apos;s what neurosurgeons do .
yes , that is correct .
but what we have here is more than just coincidence .
in fact , hitchcock himself would have been amused
at the strange confluence of circumstances .
really ? why is that ?
because cancer didn &apos;t kill mr. tahni .
it was murder .
behold .
as you can see by the ruptured blood vessel in the sclera ,
mr. tahni died of asphyxiation .
the cotton fibers that i recovered
from the trachea and lungs tells me
that he was most likely smothered to death by a pillow .
all right , so the night before
dr. dupont gets taken out in the parking lot ,
someone sneaks into the icu
and takes out one of her patients .
that can &apos;t be a coincidence .
these murders are connected , right ?
okay , but why kill a man who has less than a week to live ?
son of a bitch .
it &apos;s not that bad , mcgarrett .
it &apos;s not that bad ?
there &apos;s no wheels on my car .
there &apos;s no physical damage other than parts missing ,
and those are all replaceable .
they &apos;re not replaceable .
everything on this car except for the windshield
is original from the factory ,
just like the day my dad brought it home .
there &apos;s a homeless encampment on the beach not far from here .
maybe somebody saw something .
listen , i want any spare units canvassing the area
for anybody who may have seen somebody driving her , all right ?
i don &apos;t care what you got to do .
we got to find this guy .
you may also want to look at this .
whoever &apos;s been stripping the car
left their tools behind .
i &apos;m thinking they &apos;ll probably be back for more .
you know what ? leave it just where it is .
duke , i want around @-@ the @-@ clock surveillance on it .
contact auto crime .
have them canvass the area
for all the body shops around here ,
see if we can find the jackass selling my parts .
will do .
you want me to get csu down here to process first ?
no , it &apos;s just gonna attract unnecessary attention .
what is all that ?
this is a vintage automobile survival kit .
what is he doing ?
not needing csu .
bingo .
pua , run these prints through afis .
see if we get a hit .
right away .
well , tahni wasn &apos;t gonna win any citizenship awards ,
that &apos;s for sure .
this guy spent 40 of his 55 years on this planet
in some type of correctional facility .
at age 14,
he spent two years at the wailea reform school for boys
after committing multiple burglaries .
at age 16 , one month out of wailea ,
he committed a home invasion robbery and murdered
the homeowner in the process .
that earned him a life sentence at oahu correctional .
prison records say that he hasn &apos;t had contact
with the outside world in several years now .
how &apos;d he do inside ?
model prisoner , kept to himself .
doesn &apos;t sound like the kind of guy who &apos;s had too many enemies .
yeah , well , neither did dr. dupont ,
but we @-@ we know they both had at least one , right ?
hey , so i did a data pull
on dr. dupont &apos;s hospital desktop computer
to see what she was working on after hours .
so , she &apos;s doing internet searches
on five different people .
all she had to go on were their names .
she could only find information on one person .
walter russell .
so , he was never convicted of a crime ,
but he was charged
with felony official misconduct back in &apos; 75 when he was a warden
of the wailea reform school .
wait a minute , &apos; 75 ?
russell was a warden while tahni was there .
well , state investigators were called in
after complaints of kids being abused
and living under horrible conditions .
so , it wasn &apos;t enough to russell to trial ,
but he was forced to resign .
and a year later , the school was shut down for good .
so , tahni &apos;s on his deathbed .
he &apos;s got no one ,
and dr. dupont is the first person
to even treat the guy like a human being in years ,
so he has his come @-@ to @-@ jesus moment
before he finally checks out for good .
he decides to spill the beans about something that happened
in reform school back in the day .
and the doctor reaches out to russell ,
not realizing he &apos;s involved ,
and russell clips them both .
that &apos;s a theory .
it &apos;s more than that , actually ,
&apos;cause dr. dupont placed a call from her cell phone
to russell &apos;s house two days ago ,
and they talked for a few minutes .
yeah , the cell phone that was never found at the crime scene .
her husband said she kept it with her all the time .
well , that means whoever killed her
took that cell phone trying to cover their tracks .
fong pinged the phone .
it &apos;s been turned off .
well , i have the carrier pulling
files and records from the cloud .
all right , give me a last known address on russell .
let &apos;s dig a little deeper into these other four names
that dr. dupont was researching .
maybe russell wasn &apos;t acting alone .
how bad is your car ?
it &apos;s bad .
scale of one to ten ?
don &apos;t do this .
what am i doing ?
don &apos;t trivialize my suffering .
what ? i &apos;m gauging the damage of that piece of junk car of yours .
you just did it again . you just did it again .
all right .
talk about something else .
let &apos;s talk about something that you are more familiar with .
like , uh , child endangerment , let &apos;s talk about that .
okay .
i wouldn &apos;t have left your daughter
if you &apos;d have been doing your job as a father .
how about that ?
wow , okay . i don &apos;t like to run .
all right ?
who doesn &apos;t like to run ?
i said i don &apos;t like to run .
it &apos;s a rhetorical question .
what is that ? i hate it when you do that . what is that ?
you would have hated this more .
ah , i see .
you &apos;re welcome .
lou ,
i got a booby trap .
this guy doesn &apos;t like company .
copy that .
you &apos;re not kidding .
drop the gun .
my man , just relax .
shut up .
you are trespassing , sir .
yes , technically , you &apos;re right .
but i &apos;m a cop .
so that cancels your no visitors policy .
what are you doing here , cop ?
i just want to ask you a few questions , mr. russell .
just some questions .
oh , it &apos;s the lady doctor .
that &apos;s what this is about , right ?
she should have just left it alone .
it was none of her business . it was none of her business !
did i tell you they ruined my life , huh ?
they ruined it .
but that wasn &apos;t enough for her , no .
wasn &apos;t enough !
not for her .
she couldn &apos;t just let it sit .
she had to hurt me , huh ?
she loved to hurt .
you didn &apos;t come alone , did you ?
how many ?
enough to make sure that when this thing ends ,
you get dragged out of here in a body bag .
make them go away .
gentlemen !
gentlemen , let &apos;s just step back .
mr. russell just wants to talk .
so everybody chill .
let &apos;s hear what he &apos;s got to say .
you make them go away .
wait , wait , wait , wait .
what are you doing ?
you &apos;re welcome . again .
one , two , three . lift .
you know , for some very strange reason--
i don &apos;t know why-- this whole thing
reminds me of an easter egg hunt that we had at steve &apos;s .
i could not find , uh , this egg that i hid for grace .
well , in this case , the consequences
seem slightly more dire .
hey .
yeah .
&quot; chlorprozamine . &quot;
so russell was either bipolar ,
schizophrenic or both .
either way , the guy was off his meds .
this bottle hasn &apos;t been touched .
prescription was filled a few months ago .
well , he seemed pretty sane rambling about dr. dupont
when he had that shotgun leveled at your head .
well , he was ready for us .
whatever dupont was digging around for , he knew what it was .
all right , look , these were two well @-@ planned murders .
a guy in his mental state , living the way he did ,
there &apos;s no way he had the capacity to pull them off .
so hpd just spoke to one of the neighbors up the block .
she went driving by earlier this morning
and saw russell working in the yard
about the same time that the doc was murdered .
all right , look ,
we need to dig deeper into russell &apos;s life .
but if he didn &apos;t pull the trigger on dr. dupont ,
i bet he knew who did .
kono , what do you got ?
dr. dupont used a voice memo app on her phone
to record patient notes .
i recovered those audio files from the cloud .
most of it is just doctor @-@ patient related stuff ,
but about a week ago ,
she recorded this conversation between her and tahni .
i was born nothing ,
and i &apos;m gonna die nothing .
that &apos;s not true , mr. tahni .
you might have made some bad choices in life ,
but everybody &apos;s life has meaning .
no .
no , i &apos;m a bad person , doc .
i &apos;ve done some horrible things .
most of my life ,
i didn &apos;t give a damn about nobody .
but i liked those four boys i told you about .
they looked out for me .
they wasn &apos;t rotten like most of us in there .
they steal is all .
mostly &apos; cause they didn &apos;t have nothing
and no family to keep them right .
i &apos;m sorry , mr. tahni , but i don &apos;t understand
why you &apos;re telling me all this .
or why you want me to record our conversation .
for proof .
proof of what ?
i never had nobody i could trust .
you can trust me .
did something happen to those boys ?
i &apos;m pretty sure they were murdered .
the four boys that he &apos;s talking about
are the same four names that dr. dupont was researching .
exactly .
they were all juvenile offenders locked up with tahni
in the wailea reform school back in the &apos; 70s .
according to the tapes , the four boys escaped from the school
back in june of 1974 .
they stole a car
that was belonging to one of the guards ,
and then they burglarized a bunch of homes
on the other side of the island .
the car was recovered ,
but the boys were supposedly never found .
what do you mean , &quot; supposedly &quot; ?
well , the night after they escaped ,
tahni woke up to some noise outside his window .
shut up and keep moving .
he saw the boys being led across the yard , shackled ,
into a basement dungeon that the guards used
as solitary confinement .
they were being led there by a guard
that tahni only knew his name is &quot; huhu . &quot;
&quot; angry . &quot;
a story about a prison guard named &quot; angry &quot;
does not end well .
it doesn &apos;t .
at first , tahni didn &apos;t think much
of the boys being led to solitary .
it was just normal punishment .
but then a few nights later , he overheard an argument
between huhu and another man
that he thought could have been russell .
well , what if someone saw you bringing them back ?
trust me , no one did .
what do we say if the family comes around
asking about them ?
they won &apos;t . and even they did ,
they escaped .
simple as that .
you can &apos;t just make four boys disappear .
i already did .
tahni never saw those boys again .
this guy ,
alex mackey , was the one that everyone called huhu .
he was the guard on duty the night the boys escaped .
it was his car that they stole .
and he was the last one to see those boys alive .
sounds like he was the first one to see them dead , too .
yeah . it actually gets better .
so , after the school shut down ,
mackey went to work at kuakini medical center
as a maintenance man for the next 36 years until he retired
in 2011 .
okay , that explains
how he , uh , knew his way around the hospital
and had access to dr. dupont &apos;s schedule .
there &apos;s no public record
of any of those boys
beyond the night they escaped from the school .
it &apos;s like they just dropped off
the face of the earth after that night .
all right , so tahni heard russell say ,
&quot; you can &apos;t just make four kids disappear . &quot;
there &apos;s a chance their bodies never left those grounds .
busy day .
murder in the morning , school pickups
in the afternoon .
poppy !
hey , kiddo , how was school ?
alex mackey .
alex mackey , come with me .
what are you doing ?
take it easy .
come on .
not in front of the kids . that &apos;s my grandson .
that &apos;s your grandson ? hey , look at me .
there &apos;s two kids up at diamond head right now ,
and their mother &apos;s not
coming home for dinner , you son of a bitch .
now come on . come on , huhu .
so , you are a very special , special tough guy , right ?
i mean , you go after , uh , an innocent mother ,
a respected doctor ,
bunch of defenseless kids ,
guy with cancer on his deathbed .
you ever go after anybody who actually
could defend themselves ?
you would be my first .
okay .
why don &apos;t you do yourself a favor , alex ,
make it easy on yourself .
we know what you did . we know why you did it .
we just want to know where , that &apos;s all .
it &apos;s over , you understand ? where are the bodies ?
it &apos;s not over .
you got nothing on me .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m here , isn &apos;t it ?
you got no witnesses ,
no proof that i killed the doctor ,
that @-@ that punk murderer ,
those kids-- nothing .
go ahead , search my house ,
search my car , search whatever you like .
you won &apos;t find nothing .
look , i don &apos;t think you understand something , okay ?
that woman that you murdered ,
she &apos;s no different than your daughter , okay ?
she &apos;s got a husband ,
she has kids the same age as your grandson .
that &apos;s a very sad story , detective .
sounds like she owed it to those kids
to mind her own damn business .
maybe she &apos;d be alive if she still did .
yeah , kono , what do you got ?
is that right ?
no , that &apos;s great . listen .
call me back when you confirm , okay ?
you should hang on to that attitude as long as you can , pal ,
&apos;cause i &apos;m pretty sure the next call i get is , uh ...
is gonna wipe that stupid smirk
off your face for a very long time .
let me see you for a sec .
your thief came back to the car this morning .
there was a chase .
we caught him hiding at the homeless encampment
near the beach .
the prints from the marquis were a match .
what &apos;s your name ?
nahele .
i have to call your parents , all right ?
my mom is dead and my dad is in prison .
when &apos;s the last time you had something to eat ?
i don &apos;t know .
get him some food , some new clothes .
yes , commander .
i &apos;m sorry .
i @-@ i &apos;ve never stolen anything before .
it &apos;s just that
i was so hungry .
it &apos;s all right . just take it easy .
it &apos;s all right .
how long you been on the street ?
a few months .
they tried to put me in one of those homes after my mom died ,
but i couldn &apos;t stay there .
so i ran away .
hey , boss .
you need to see this .
all right .
get him fed and get him cleaned up ,
and then , uh , just keep him here until i get back .
copy that .
commander , after a thorough examination ,
i &apos;ve determined that each of our young victims
were suffering from acute dehydration and starvation
in the days leading up to and at the time of their deaths .
take a look at this .
the week they disappeared was
one of the hottest on record for oahu .
daytime temps hovered in the mid @-@ 90s for five straight days .
and ...
this is the basement that the school used as solitary confinement .
the same one that tahni saw the boys being led into
the night they returned .
no windows , no ventilation .
must have been unbearable down there .
in that kind of heat ,
left in a poorly ventilated space , without food or water
for a significant amount of time would be
equivalent to leaving an infant in a car
with a rolled @-@ up window in the middle of the summer .
as a result of all these findings ,
i &apos;m listing the official cause of death
as homicide .
place sucks , huh ?
enjoy it &apos; cause it &apos;s , uh , the ritz @-@ carlton
compared to where you &apos;re going .
see , we found those boys up at that school .
we also found enough evidence
to throw your sorry ass in halawa
for the rest of your life .
you didn &apos;t even have the decency to take the shackles
off those kids before you buried them .
huhu ?
we &apos;re not bluffing .
nobody gave a rat &apos;s ass about those kids .
nobody !
but that nosy doctor couldn &apos;t leave it alone .
it was over .
forgotten about ! done !
no , you &apos;re wrong , actually .
you see , tahni remembered , and for the first time
in his miserable life , he decided to do something good .
piece of garbage .
useless , worthless punk .
you know the world is a better place without those kids .
you know it is !
i don &apos;t know ... i don &apos;t know about that , but what i do know
is that you are going to die in prison ,
a &quot; useless , worthless punk &quot;
that i &apos;m pretty sure nobody cares about .
i &apos;m done .
thanks , pua .
you know what that is ?
that &apos;s a criminal complaint for felony grand larceny auto ,
charging you with the theft of my car .
i @-@ i understand , sir . and ...
when i get out of jail ,
promise i &apos;ll pay you back ...
hold on , hold on . i &apos;m not done .
the only thing missing from this is my signature .
i &apos;m gonna make you the deal of a lifetime .
all right ?
this is what &apos;s gonna happen .
first , we &apos;re gonna go to all the body shops ,
get back all the parts you sold off .
and then you and me ,
we &apos;re gonna put my car back together exactly the way it was
before you took it .
as long as you keep your nose clean ,
this complaint stays in my drawer , unsigned .
you understand ?
yes . thank you .
don &apos;t thank me yet .
i got eyes and ears all over this island .
if i hear one incident , you step out of line
one time for the smallest thing , i don &apos;t care what it is ,
i &apos;m gonna find you .
and i &apos;m not gonna be the nice guy sitting across the desk
from you today . do you understand ?
yes . thank you .
this is your second chance , nahele , all right ?
could be ... could be your last chance .
don &apos;t blow it , buddy . take advantage of it .
i will , sir . i promise . i won &apos;t let you down .
you &apos;ll see .
all right .
yeah , girl power .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m talking about .
you should be really proud , grace . that &apos;s a very big deal .
believe it or not ,
i was a former recipient .
really ? wow . you should call ripley &apos;s if that &apos;s true .
hey , guys , i got some bad news .
delano has been officially released from the icu
and is expected to make a full recovery .
well , we can still hope for stomach cancer .
ooh , that &apos;s cold , cuz .
i &apos;d settle for a shiv in the lunch line .
what &apos;s a shiv ?
hey . look who &apos;s sporting the hardware .

in her age group on the entire island .

i would &apos;ve done anything in the world
to keep that stuff from happening to you .
i &apos;m afraid there &apos;s nothing i can do to change that now .
the only thing that can change now
is you .
and that &apos;s gonna take time .
just like your body had to heal ,
your mind has to heal , too ,
and ... you might have another bad night or two .
i &apos;m not gonna promise you you &apos;re gonna forget
all about this one day ,
but i can promise you it &apos;s gonna get easier .
you know , i can promise you that we will get through this ...
as a family .

me and you .
and i want you to know
that whether i &apos;m in the next room or not ,
i &apos;m always there for you , little mama .
