Does anybody recognize this?
Is there anything on the back?
Yeah, number 1.
That's "A"'s cell phone.
Spence, your sister's "A."
It's been Melissa all along.
What were you doing in Alison's bedroom?
I'd be careful, Spence.
I got fired today.
What are you gonna do?
Probably head up to my folks' place for a while.
When will you be back?
If I can't teach in this town, what's left?
Maya and I got in a fight the other night at the party,
and I haven't talked to her since.
I've been thinking a lot about us.
It's a little late for that, isn't it?
How do you have this?
Garrett asked me to keep it safe for him,
but I think the police should have it.
You're under arrest.
For what?
The murder of Alison Dilaurentis.
One week after his arrest,
Reynolds pled not guilty to the charge
of Alison DiLaurentis's murder.
However, prosecutors remain confident with their case.
Rosewood P.D.'s working theory
is that Reynolds became a police officer
to destroy evidence that linked him to the murder scene.
Investigators received a break in the case
when that document was recovered.
That must be page 5 of Ali's autopsy report.
Garrett took it, but somebody gave it back.
My mom is friends with the prosecutor.
That somebody... was Jenna.
Can we finally put Ali to rest now?
Or is two down and two to go?
Ian's dead, Garrett's in jail.
Melissa and Jenna were in Ali's room that night too.
They may not have killed Ali
but they're definitely guilty of something.
Love gone wrong.
What are you talking about?
I knew Ian didn't kill Alison,
and you four can keep a secret,
but you don't have the constitution for murder.
Are you gonna eat that?
Thanks.
I know how Jenna Marshall went blind,
and so did Garrett.
If he killed Alison,
it's because he thought she deserved it.
Is this peanut butter?
Toffee.
Mm. It is good.
Thanks.
She definitely knows about the Jenna thing.
"You still have something that belongs to me.
Bring it, or one of you leaves in a body bag. 'A.'"
"A" has to be talking about her phone.
You still have it locked in your closet, right?
Yes.
I don't know about you guys,
But "A" talking about body bags makes me very nervous.
Guys, it was a messenger.
Something for each of us.
"A" wants to play hide-and-seek.
"Be there when the clock strikes midnight."
Spence?
Hide-and-seek was my favorite game with Melissa.
You wanna know why?
I always won.
She was in that kitchen eating frozen yogurt,
basically just telling us that she was "A."
And now she wants to kill one of us.
Parties and body bags go together
like drinking and driving.
Guys, I don't trust Melissa
as far as I can throw her and Ian's fetus,
But let's not forget that Jenna also knows about the Jenna thing.
Ian's fetus? Em, that's disgusting.
Look, "A" is all-knowing, all right?
It's like a genius on steroids.
The only person I know that's smarter than Spencer
is her sister.
Um, I take offense.
Melissa did score higher on the Wechsler Scale,
But when you take into account my scores and the Flynn Effect,
combined with real-life accomplishments,
the gap in our I.Q.S is virtually nonexistent.
Um... What are you doing with Ali's bag?
I'm giving "A" back her phone over my dead body,
which means that we have until midnight tomorrow
to unmask this bitch once and for all,
and this bag has brought us closer to the truth
than we've ever gotten.
You think there's something in there we missed?
We need to go through it again, all of us,
with a fresh pair of eyes.
But with Melissa at home, I...
No, forget my place.
My mom is still hot on the "A" trail.
Look, let's just meet after school.
I have an idea for a great costume.
Oh, you are going to the Masquerade Mash?
Me too. Can you believe blind Jenna's going?
A week ago, that would have made me a no-show,
but since she dumped Noel Kahn for seeing-eye Toby--
Sorry, Spencer.
[法语]
I love this vintage shop a few towns over.
We should all go after school and get our costumes together!
I would love to, but, um,
I have to take my sister to an ultrasound.
My mom's coming back tomorrow,
so I have some house stuff.
Yeah, and vintage is my middle name,but..
I gotta get to class.
That leaves us.
Look, I am so sorry, Mona,
but I have to study with Caleb after school.
So it's just me... again.
"Tristan and Isolde"?
"Abelard and Heloise"?
This is too cute.
Fitz is a sucker for a tragic love story.
I so didn't mean that how it sounded.
Have you heard from him?
Yeah, he checks in.
Everything he thought he wanted, he's lost because of me.
Guys, I-I think that it might be over this time.
Really over.
Great.
Now Mona knows I lied about where I am.
And Caleb is with her...
so he's gonna ask me why I ditched her.
You know, I am lying to everyone I care about.
I don't even know why I started lying to begin with.
You're lying because you
don't want the people that you care about
to end up like Dr. Sullivan--
Here one day and gone the next.
Hanna, do you mind?
It's... kind of sacred ground.
It is?
Man! You sure can keep a secret.
Hey, Em, can you grab my computer?
What is it, Spence?
Could you look up Dougherty's landing?
It's a tiny airstrip off of highway 30.
Is it close to anything?
No, it's in the middle of nowhere.
Wait... What did that postcard say?
Um... "Meets 30."
"The lost woods resort.
Find us where Greenview meets 30."
Duncan said that he flew Ali to an airfield
the day she disappeared.
This has to be where she went.
Maybe Room One?
Are you sure this is right?
This is Greenview.
What was that?
I-I don't know. A deer, I think.
Maybe we should go back.
No! Okay, we didn't come this far to give up.
Careful, Spence.
What is that?
What would Ali be doing up here?
She wasn't bagging a deer, that's for sure.
Are you checking in?
I was surprised when you girls pulled up.
People don't come here much any more,
since they built the interstate.
It doesn't bother me, though.
I like the quiet.
Sign here.
Welcome to the Lost Woods Resort...
Mary Smith.
Um, is Room One available?
How'd you know about Room One?
Sorry?
It's got the hottest water on the property.
It's perfect for a night like this.
Oh, o-our friend, the one who told us about this place,
she stayed in Room One.
Maybe you remember her--
Vivian Darkbloom?
Name doesn't ring a bell.
Besides, I learned a long time ago
not to tell tales about folks who stay here.
You check into the Lost Woods
because you don't want to be found.
Ununh! Damn it!
Are you okay?
Hanna, come on!
I'm... not exactly sure what we're looking for.
Ali left Ian to come up here for a reason.
What was it?
Love how they call this place a resort.
Do you think that Ali came here to hide something?
Or do you think that she came here to hide,
from "A"?
We need to get into the office.
Was Ali here alone,
or did she come with somebody?
Is he still there?
I think that he left.
I'm just dying to get a look at that registration book.
Wait, really?
You're gonna come with me?
Does it look like those two are moving?
I'm cold.
Okay, no, I'm colder than she is.
You're little,
but you're big.
Is it just me, or is she staring at us?
Come on.
I can't believe you're taking a shower in this place.
It's gross.
God, Emily, I'm covered in mud.
Hello? Maya?
Can you hear me?
Ali checked into Room One
as Vivian Darkbloom the morning
before she went missing.
Are--are there any other names in here that we know?
Emily?
Ali stayed here twice,
and the first time was the day she was supposed to
be meeting "A" in Brookhaven.
Coincidence? I doubt it.
Seriously?
She still didn't call back?
My mom's not even home yet, and I'm lying to her.
She thinks I'm staying at your house.
Oh, that works, 'cause my mom thinks that I stayed at yours.
We're not stealing that, are we?
No. We'll go put it back.
We?
Spencer, you are not gonna make me
crawl through that window again, are you?
I'll do it, I just need you to stand guard.
Come on, we're "Team Sparia."
What's wrong?
Caleb can't take me to the masquerade party anymore.
His mom's flying in tonight.
My costume needed a date.
What's your costume?
I wanted to be Juliet, since Bridget Woo beat me out
for the part in the 6th grade.
Looking back, I think I wanted to be Romeo.
So, will you go to the party with me?
I'll be your date...
but I'm not dressing like a dude.
Harold's back.
Let's go before he realizes we touched his stuff!
Spencer.
Have you heard anything?
What might have caused the fire?
Just that it wasn't an accident.
How is Jenna?
She seems fine.
Are you gonna be bringing her to the masquerade party?
No.
Jenna found a way to forgive me.
Do you think that you will ever be able to?
I have work to do.
Look, you have every right to hate me, okay,
but you don't have to be that guy.
You don't have to be the guy that won't let anybody in.
Dr. Sullivan?
I've thought about this moment so many times,
wondering what I would say to you if I saw you again.
They're all gonna be at the party.
You know what you need to do.
This is the perfect place for "A" to hide.
Where was Melissa when you left?
In her pajamas, curled up on the couch.
We have three hours
to find out who "A" is before "A" finds us.
We all still agree, right?
No matter what happens at midnight,
we stick together, and we are not giving up that phone.
That's four against one. I like those odds.
Should we split up and look around?
None of us have dates, so...
Let's meet back here in an hour,
and keep your phones close.
I know who you are.
Caleb?
You must have me confused with somebody else.
My name's Romeo.
I thought you were spending the night with your mom.
I'm gonna see her tomorrow.
And I wanted to surprise you.
I'm surprised.
I can't take all the credit.
Mona helped me pick out the costume.
Wait-- Mona, you did this?
Call me guilty.
You know, I'm sorry for yesterday.
From now on, I promise, no more secrets, okay?
You'll tell me about it later.
Now, go dance with your sizzling hot toddy
before he melts the room.
I love you, Mona.
I love you, too.
I have to admit...
You had me fooled.
But I've got you figured out.
Do tell.
I don't know why you hide behind that layer of superficial bitch,
but you are a great friend to Hanna.
That means more to me than you'll ever know.
Thanks to Alison, I went years without any friends.
We never stood up to her.
I'm sorry for that.
I quit thinking about that stuff a long time ago.
But it's funny-- today I just couldn't get her out of my mind.
I took Caleb to that store I was talking about yesterday.
It's a tiny place. Thank you.
You'd never find it if you didn't know it was there.
It's in Brookhaven.
I know Brookhaven.
It's the last place I saw Ali alive,
about a week before she went missing.
Alison?
Crap.
I can't believe you're here.
It's kind of like we're shopping together.
Alison?
Why are you dressed like that?
What's going on?
Is it some sort of a game?
Mona, can I tell you a secret?
For real?
It's for real, and for keeps.
I can't believe you're talking to me.
Yeah, well...
I-I'm watching someone.
Who?
Mona, this isn't a game.
Just pretend like you don't know me and take off, okay?
Wow. The Ali D. needs something
from Mona Vanderwaal.
What's it worth to you?
What do you want?
To be popular.
I left her a message that night,
But then she went all M.I.A. on us,
And she never called me.
Did you see who Alison was watching?
Do you mean who she was spying on?
No, it was probably just some guy she had a crush on.
"A" wasn't watching Ali in Brookhaven.
Ali was watching "A."
Okay, wait.
If this is "A" code,
I didn't get the handbook.
Look, Ali checked into a motel the day before she went missing.
She didn't go there to hide from "A."
I think she followed "A" there.
Hello?
No matter how hard I try...
I can't stay away from you.
Keep your friends close, Em.
Spencer, where are you?
That's what Ali was doing,
Keeping her enemies even closer.
I'm on my way back to the motel right now.
Now?
Yes!
When we checked into the motel, there was a key
for every room available except for room two.
Room two hasn't been booked since before Ali went missing.
Don't you get it, Em?
Nobody checks into room two because it's been rented,
and Ali checked into the room next door
because she was spying on "A."
Spencer, don't go out there alone. Wait for us.
No, I don't want us all to leave.
We can't tip "A" off.
And besides, I'm not alone. I'm with Mona.
Okay, you've got two hours to get back here.
Okay.
It's kind of you to take the time to sit with me.
It must get lonely out here.
I find myself talking to these stuffed creatures.
Well, I guess you really only have to worry
if they start to talk back to you.
What's that supposed to mean?
It was a joke.
Um... thank you,
for the tea.
You haven't finished.
What's wrong?
This is our first dance.
I want to see you.
Emily.
Oh, my god.
Spencer, what is this place?
This is "A's" lair.
I'm sorry about the other night.
Just forget about it.
That's the thing--
I don't want to forget about it.
We have a connection. You can't deny that.
We did. But I...
I get it. I messed it up.
You weren't ready, and that's okay.
I wish I'd fought harder for you.
I'm sorry, Paige.
I didn't tell you so you'd be sorry.
I just want to be honest.
And I care about you.
So I'll be here for you, for whatever you need.
I think what I need right now is a friend.
Then it's official. We're friends.
That makes me happy.
Spencer?
This has to be "A's" costume.
I'll call Hanna.
"A's" dressed as the black swan.
Who is that?
Gum?
Uh, no, thanks.
Okay.
Why aren't they calling us back?
This is Ali's diary.
Melissa was the black swan at a charity ball
in Philly last year.
You don't think she'd do anything
to try and hurt you, do you?
Why would you ask me that?
Well, I just thought that's what you meant.
Melissa's the black swan. Maybe she's "A."
Actually, can I have that gum now?
Sure.
You know, I think I have more in the car,
so I'll be right back, okay?
There she is.
Who is that?
I can't tell from here.
Tall, size two.
I hate her already.
It's Lucas.
They're all together.
Come on.
Cashmere sweaters.
I found the gum.
You didn't call Hanna, did you?
Because you're "A."
Congratulations, Spencer.
You figured it out.
She's leaving! Hurry!
It's locked!
I'm calling Spencer.
This phone is a piece of crap.
I'll call her.
That's weird.
What?
Here.
Your phone is set to record every time it's turned on.
I had to get you out there alone, so we could talk.
Okay.
Just slow down, okay? Let's talk.
You had to earn it--
The right to be a part of it.
You didn't see Ali in Brookhaven.
She saw you, didn't she?
You just made that story up.
We're in this together now.
I admire you, Spencer.
That's why you get to decide how this ends, tonight.
You can join the "A" Team, or you can disappear.
You...you almost killed Hanna.
She's my friend.
I thought she was your friend too.
It's easier to forgive an enemy than it is
to forgive a friend.
Oh, my god. It's Mona.
How did you do it?
How could you be everywhere?
You were always one step ahead of us.
You're not the only genius in this car.
You bitches underestimated me.
You're never gonna make it to lookout point
if you don't slow down.
They're going to lookout point.
I know a shortcut. Come on.
Hanna.
Mona's "A."
Come on.
Is this some kind of payback?
Because we let Ali treat you like that?
I am so over Ali. I told you.
She was never my friend, but Hanna was.
And you bitches took her from me.
This is about betrayal?
It's not about betrayal, Spencer, it's about revenge!
You deserved everything you got!
You stole my only friend.
Mona, she's still your friend!
Okay.
So what's the plan?
I mean, "A" always has a plan, right?
Yes. She does.
What happens if I don't join the team?
Melissa doesn't have your dad's gun. I do.
When Ali left, it pulled you guys apart.
It'll be the same if you go away.
No, it won't.
Hanna, stop! Hanna!
Hanna, stop! Hanna!
Hanna! Hanna!
Get up!
Spencer!
Dr. Sullivan?
Are you all okay?
We tried to find you.
What did she do to you? Where have you been?
She threatened my son.
I didn't think I had a choice.
I needed to leave. I'm so very sorry.
Hanna...
Hanna, it's all right. You're safe now.
I can't believe this.
She was my friend.
It's over, Aria.
She's alive!
She was living in a perpetual state of hyper reality.
The adrenaline rush that accompanied
her feelings of empowerment
and her high level of intelligence
fueled Mona's ability
to be seemingly all-knowing and omnipresent.
Will she always be like this?
With therapy and the right medications,
people with these personality disorders
can get better.
I know they're watching me.
I don't look bad, considering.
I like this lipstick.
What's it called? Toffee Tango?
They think it's over.
Loser Mona's going to the nuthouse,
and those precious liars are going home to sleep
with their windows open and their doors unlocked.
Don't they know that's what we want?
I never thought I'd find the strength to come back here,
but your friend showed up, and he was very convincing.
I help people push through their fears,
but he helped me push through mine.
Wait, our friend?
Pretending not to love you
was the hardest thing I've ever done.
You gonna be okay at home tonight?
I know Mona's "A."
I just keep seeing that faceless person in the black hoodie.
Let's sleep at my place.
My mom will be thrilled to have a reason to cook.
That sounds like old times.
Honey, they found a body.
They think it's-- it's Maya.
Mona, you have a visitor.
