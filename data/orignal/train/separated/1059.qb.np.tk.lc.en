i don &apos;t even know who attacked me .
dennis flynn . we think he killed ellen .
i was undercover with the flynn organization .
they were a local crime family
with some p.d. on the payroll .
ballistics matched flynn &apos;s gun to ellen &apos;s murder weapon .
so we got him .
somebody else got him , too .
flynn was being escorted to a transport car
when he was stabbed to death by a prisoner with a shiv .
neal , if they can get to flynn like this ...
ellen said that whatever &apos;s in that pendant
is the key to finding the evidence box .
how do we do it ?
well , i &apos;m listed as her next of kin ,
so it &apos;ll be sent to me .
great . once we have the key --
once i have the key .
neal , we need to talk .
what &apos;s up ?
as you know ,
a few hours after we arrested dennis flynn , jr . ,
he was shivved on the way to the bus .
no suspects .
do we know why he was transferred ?
senator terrence pratt ordered the transfer .
wanted him in d.c.
why would a senator from maryland
care where flynn served time ?
because before he ran for public office ,
he was a police captain in d.c.
the same time my dad and ellen were on the force .
he &apos;s got to be one of the dirty cops ellen was investigating .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m thinking . he &apos;s the one .
he had access to notice
when sam or ellen &apos;s names popped up on the databases .
if he was on the flynns &apos; payroll when he was a cop ,
they have a common enemy .
pratt reaches out to flynn ,
tells him he knows where he can find
the people who took down his family .
flynn kills ellen and goes after my dad ,
but we grab flynn .
pratt &apos;s worried that he &apos;s gonna talk ,
so he orders the transfer and has him murdered .
it &apos;s a good theory .
pratt &apos;s gonna be in manhattan this week .
i &apos;m gonna invite him into the offices
so he can tell me what he knows about the flynns .
i like it .
think he &apos;ll come ?
i would , just to see what you know .
the marshals finally came through .
a life packed up and inventoried .
ellen certainly didn &apos;t leave much behind .
well , she knew she was being uprooted .
she only held onto things with sentimental value .
or something that could tear the lid off a dirty police division .
that &apos;s the key .
i &apos;ve never seen anything like it .
it &apos;s in two pieces .
how do we find the evidence box it opens ?
if i use bureau resources , pratt will know .
so we let mozzie run with the key .
want to rephrase ?
if anyone can find what this unlocks , it &apos;s him .
all right , but i don &apos;t want mozzie alone on this .
he doesn &apos;t play well with others .
which hand ?
it doesn &apos;t matter . i know i &apos;m gonna be wrong .
i only have two .
where &apos;s the key , quantico ?
the left .
i use my trigger thumbs to switch the key between hands .
yeah , you got me .
i can &apos;t work with this .
he has no visual acuity .
mozzie , tell us about the key .
well , the two @-@ part design makes it unique .
the heavy corrosion masks its true identity .
this , uh , muscled excess baggage here
will only hinder my path of discovery .
come on .
okay . suit jones can ride along --
provided he can keep up .
not gonna be a problem .
the key stays with jones at all time .
neal .
peter .
moz .
jones .
good . we have a meeting with a senator .
good luck .
ok . give me the key .
not a chance , tiny .
senator , this is special agent peter burke
and his consultant , neal caffrey .
i appreciate your coming , senator .
how could i say no to law enforcement ?
senator , the ozone meeting confirmed ,
and there will be national press at the penner lunch .
kyle runs my calendar like an airstrip at andrews ,
so we &apos;ll need to keep this brief .
it was an honor to meet you , senator .
thank you .
i &apos;ll get right to it .
dennis flynn , you know the family .
of course , from my days on metro p.d.
we were hoping for some insight .
well , when i was a cop in d.c. , my department cracked down
on an earlier generation of the flynn family .
is that why you requested dennis flynn &apos;s transfer ?
well , that family did a lot of damage to my state .
i wanted to send a clear message to my voters
that i &apos;d tie up loose ends .
well , it &apos;s unfortunate flynn died before we could question --
any idea who wanted him killed ?
well , clearly , he had enemies .
i &apos;m not surprised it ended that way .
but with a father like his ... kid never stood a chance .
neal , would you help diana with the ramirez file ?
it &apos;s due today .
of course .
mr. caffrey , is it ?
you and agent burke have done a great service
taking a ruthless criminal off the street ,
and i want to thank you for that .
that &apos;s what we do , sir .
senator pratt &apos;s office .
hey , it &apos;s george from bloomberg &apos;s .
the mayor heard pratt &apos;s in town .
why aren &apos;t we on the books ?
let me see what we can do .
listen , i got another call . can you hold ?
hey . want some more ?
yeah . all right .
thank you .
bye .
bye .
give me the good news , kyle .
we can do 4 : 30 .
yeah , that &apos;s not gonna work .
that &apos;s all we &apos;ve got .
well , give us a heads up next time .
i read up on the d.c. flynns .
seems their downfall hinged on the word of a dirty cop--
james bennett .
detective bennett was tragic .
he turned state evidence on the flynns .
he did .
you knew him well ?
yes , i was his captain .
did everything i could for jimmy bennett .
ultimately , he was a lost cause .
well , he came prepared .
yeah , he knows we &apos;re onto him .
we woke a giant , neal .
good news is i got a look at his itinerary .
we &apos;ll know where he &apos;s gonna be when he &apos;s in new york .
excellent . pratt wants us to back down .
what do you want ?
justice .
you ready to take down a giant ?
grab your slingshot .
hey , honey . how &apos;s the planning going ?
this party will be the first time
the author appears without a burka ,
and what does the publisher want ? belly dancing .
that seems sort of contrary .
yeah , it undermines the whole important message of the book ,
and he wants me to compromise ?
don &apos;t .
you dig in your heels .
you look him straight in the eye
and tell him you &apos;re gonna do it your way .
you know , you &apos;re like a hot deepak chopra .
really ?
i &apos;ll take that . hot deepak .
it &apos;s late . expecting someone ?
yeah , hughes . work @-@ related .
what kind of work stuff means a house call from your boss ?
decades of cover @-@ ups , organized crime , two murders ?
now , this is much bigger than caffrey and his father .
it &apos;s public corruption , reese .
we need to take out pratt .
he &apos;s got juice .
i know .
you got a plan ?
i want to start by putting taps on him while he &apos;s in new york .
this stays small .
you , me , and my team .
you have a judge you can trust ?
i &apos;ll handle it .
you know , but pratt &apos;s on the crime and terrorism subcommittee .
he &apos;ll figure it out . you won &apos;t have much time .
be careful , peter . he can hurt you .
i will .
reese went out the back .
he said to tell you good night .
&quot; dig your heels in . you know what &apos;s right &quot; ?
is that advice for me or for you ?
you heard us out there ?
didn &apos;t even need a warrant .
you said pratt could hurt you .
i have to go after him , el . it &apos;s my job .
is this about you helping neal and his father
or arresting the bad guy ?
it &apos;s about both .
just don &apos;t get in so deep that you can &apos;t get out .
i won &apos;t . i promise .
now ...
you come to bed with this hot deepak chopra .
our warrant came through .
pratt &apos;s in manhattan for just 48 hours .
now &apos;s our shot to go all &quot; big brother &quot; on him .
well , thanks to caffrey &apos;s snooping ,
we know what pratt &apos;s day looks like .
he starts here .
kensington barbershop ?
known for their luxury shaves .
how much does that run him ?
probably $ 200 , plus tip .
$ 200 ? ! that covers my grooming for the year .
you &apos;ve never had a traditional shave ?
no .
oh , warm towel , hot lather ,
single @-@ edged blade stropped to surgical perfection .
i &apos;ll stick to my disposable blades and a can of barbasol .
anyway , while the senator &apos;s wrapped in hot towels ,
we can plant a bug on him .
well , i talked to the owner .
he was not happy , but he agreed to let us take over the shop .
good . pratt knows what neal and i look like .
diana , how are you with a straight razor ?
better than sweeney todd .
just to your left a little bit .
senator pratt , welcome . i &apos;m dierdre .
hello , dierdre .
may i take your briefcase and jacket , sir ?
thank you .
it is such an honor to have you .
oh , thank you very much .
nigel here will get you comfortable
while i put these away .
great .
all right , pratt &apos;s phone isn &apos;t in his pocket .
and it &apos;s not in here .
damn it . it &apos;s on him . what do we do ?
we could try giving him a manicure .
i &apos;ll put a compress on his eyes so he can &apos;t see .
and i &apos;ll switch out the sim card .
how much is a manicure ?
you don &apos;t want to know .
feeling comfy ?
very .
look at your hands ! you , sir , need a manicure .
manicure , huh ?
you bite you nails .
you got me .
shall i ?
let &apos;s do it .
all right .
close your eyes .
there you go .
i &apos;ll hang onto that .
oh , it &apos;s , uh -- it &apos;s kind of tough to work around .
come on , you &apos;re the pro . you &apos;ll figure it out .
okay .
i &apos;m just gonna soak your hand .
there you go .
and the other one .
sorry .
i got it . there you go .
sorry about that .
okay . soak the other one .
there you go .
this is pratt .
senator terrence pratt ?
yeah .
oh , uh , i represent p.a.n.e.o. --
people for the awareness of near @-@ earth objects .
are we talking asteroids ?
among other things .
what &apos;s your stance on impact monitoring .
my voters prefer if i focus on issues
that impact their daily lives .
your voters will know impact
once 2014 az5 annihilates their condos .
think about that while you &apos;re sipping your cocoa tonight .
okay .
how do these nutjobs get my number ?
i &apos;ll just dry that off for you .
there you go .
thank you , dierdre .
you &apos;re welcome .
tracking chip &apos;s in place .
camera and audio are in the briefcase .
okay .
say cheese .
camembert .
i hope pratt &apos;s ready for his close @-@ up .
yep .
how &apos;s pratt &apos;s day going ?
he &apos;s sticking close to his itinerary .
he made one unscheduled stop at a construction site in midtown .
oh , briefcase cam . nice .
that &apos;s cole edwards ,
one of the city &apos;s biggest real @-@ estate developers .
he &apos;s responsible for some of the ugliest skyscrapers
i &apos;ve ever seen .
edwards is also one of pratt &apos;s major campaign donors .
i &apos;m pulling old line off this project .
you sure ?
&apos;cause once i get things lined up ,
it &apos;s gonna be a real moneymaker .
yeah , well , there &apos;ll be other things .
have we got a problem , terry ?
i &apos;ll take care of it .
what would be the reason
pratt would keep a meeting with his biggest donor a secret ?
construction &apos;s rife with corruption .
we need to look into old line .
get started . i &apos;ll hit city planning .
if the project they &apos;re discussing isn &apos;t above @-@ board ,
it could be our way into pratt .
you know , i &apos;d go with you ,
but mozzie and i have an appointment with , uh ...
... &quot; the keymaster . &quot;
you ever think you &apos;d say that out loud ?
i &apos;ll let you know how deep the rabbit hole goes .
keymaster ? your guy &apos;s a hoarder .
oh , zimmer chaos .
i use him on the rare occasion i hit a wall
of the lock @-@ and @-@ key variety .
be forewarned , though .
every transaction with him involves a riddle .
a riddle ?
imminently solvable .
so your guy &apos;s weird and annoying .
perhaps , but the answer to his riddle
is his fee for his expertise about the key .
so you guys work a barter system .
well , the last time i had an exchange with zimmer ,
he paid me with a pair of houdini &apos;s handcuffs .
yeah , he should have paid you with his straightjacket .
oh , already have one , wing tips .
of course you do .
ah , mozzie , last time i saw you , you left in cuffs .
on my own terms , of course .
who &apos;s this ?
my intern .
let &apos;s talk about this key .
what &apos;s this unlock ?
patience , intern .
you need something from me ...
i must have something from you .
okay , drop your riddle , zimmer .
you guys are serious ?
rome , roam , a basket takes him far from home .
in the desert , he ... is the son .
the fee for my services is the answer .
okay , uh , basket , rome , desert , scary baby .
ah , it &apos;s s @-@ o @-@ n , not s @-@ u @-@ n . thank you , sunday school .
obviously --
9 : 00 a.m. tomorrow .
if you want my help ... bring the answer .
tomorrow ? what do -- what ? it &apos;s -- it &apos;s easy .
it &apos;s moses , right ?
seriously ? it &apos;s never that simple .
what , so we &apos;re leaving already ?
we just got here !
jones , keep up .
come , intern .
all right , so old line is pratt &apos;s corporation .
he uses it to invest in private ventures
when he wants his name kept out of it .
a lot of these investments
fall under edwards &apos; commercial real @-@ estate empire .
yeah , pratt sends a lot of money edwards &apos; way .
yeah , and it &apos;s not all his own .
pratt &apos;s voting record shows he supported federal funds
for edwards &apos; building sites , corporate tax breaks .
oh , all the good stuff .
so , pratt helps edwards &apos; business .
edwards donates money back to pratt .
yeah , politics since the beginning of time .
nothing illegal about it .
yeah , and they know it &apos;s not , so why are they meeting in secret .
i &apos;m gonna check in with peter .
neal .
hey , we think pratt and edwards are working a quid pro quo ,
but we haven &apos;t found enough to move on .
i did .
on my way back to the office .
so we can put the edwards files under a microscope .
what the --
oh , damn .
what &apos;s going on ?
i don &apos;t have brakes .
what ?
what ?
my brakes -- i don &apos;t have my brakes .
come on ! come on !
peter ?
peter ?
how is he ?
oh , um , i don &apos;t -- i don &apos;t know yet .
he &apos;s unconscious . his arm &apos;s hurt .
he has a concussion , but we don &apos;t know how bad .
i &apos;m so sorry .
oh , um , the emt gave me these .
they were in the car with him .
thanks .
how are you doing ?
diana , could i -- could i talk to neal alone ?
of course .
um , i &apos;ll take these back to the office .
keep me posted , okay ?
i will .
they said it was low brake fluid ,
but the bureau maintains its cars .
we &apos;ll find out what happened .
here &apos;s what happened .
peter went after a u.s. senator ,
but someone wants him to stop .
it &apos;s possible .
you and i both know it &apos;s more than that .
what are you saying ?
i &apos;m saying that it &apos;s about you and your father .
peter would do anything to help you .
and this is what he gets ?
do you know what it felt like to have somebody
in brooks brothers and a poker face
tell you that your husband &apos;s been in an accident ?
pratt &apos;s corrupt , and peter &apos;s not gonna back down .
nor should he .
i need your help .
tell me what you want me to do .
i know you and he were looking into something off @-@ book .
what was it ?
we were looking into a key that ellen left behind .
no more &quot; we . &quot;
i don &apos;t want the next call i get to be from the morgue .
you look into this key without him .
i can &apos;t lie to peter .
if you have to lie to his face to keep him safe ,
you damn well lie to his face .
well , obviously , my liver is a write @-@ off ,
but my acupuncturist will testify
to the virginal state of my spleen .
that &apos;s very generous , moz , but peter doesn &apos;t need your spleen .
you make any headway on zimmer &apos;s riddle .
no , and i am staring down the barrel
of a 9 a.m. deadline .
so we still have time to freeze the fbi out .
my instinct from the beginning !
i know . i know .
why the change of heart ?
neal ?
elizabeth asked me .
look , pratt already destroyed my family .
i &apos;m not gonna let it happen to hers .
peter &apos;s got enough to handle going after pratt .
we track the key on our own .
okay .
diana , hey .
caffrey , i think i know what peter found .
be right there .
whenever a builder alters plans to a site ,
he has to file one of these change orders
with city planning .
these are all from edwards &apos; projects .
these are all for changes in materials used for construction .
multiple change orders is a red flag for fraud .
wait a second .
look at where the ink bled
and the date on the change order underneath it .
january 21 , 2010 .
so they stamped it and filed it away before the ink was dry .
yeah , but not in 2010 .
oh , hey -- i was drinking that .
don &apos;t worry . i keep my hands clean .
yeah , i need an fbi file from the same year .
see , the fbi stamp &apos;s less pigmented .
there &apos;s no sheen .
that &apos;s how three @-@ year @-@ old ink should look .
it shouldn &apos;t smear .
these change orders were stamped recently and re @-@ filed .
looks like we found a way to get to pratt .
i could do it again if you want to see .
no .
okay .
tell me why edwards would file change orders retroactively .
he got nervous when pratt paid him a visit
and decided to cover his tracks
in case anyone else checked up on him .
which we did .
his original plans always use more expensive materials
than the ones on the change orders .
and we think he &apos;s swapping in cheaper materials ,
paying off the right people , and skimming millions .
even if you get him , how are you gonna link it to senator pratt ?
edwards has a couple of high rises
in midtown under construction .
one stalled out . he fired his architect .
he &apos;s looking for a new one .
and i bet you always wanted to be an architect , right , caffrey ?
i hook edwards on a pillar of power and prestige ,
sell him on materials , and if we &apos;re right about his m.o. ,
we get him for fraud .
then we have the leverage we need to flip him on pratt .
backstop the hell out of our new architect , berrigan .
and run the design by our engineers .
make sure the damn thing won &apos;t fall down .
and caffrey , don &apos;t stand under any cranes .
yes , sir .
so far , this investigation
has put my best agent in the hospital .
we &apos;ll make sure it wasn &apos;t for nothing .
&quot; the higher the building , the lower the morals . &quot;
when &apos;d you make a mold of the key ?
oh , please . the moment you handed it to me .
backup in case the bureau took it away .
now my copy will mislead agent jones .
nice , moz .
yeah , but this riddle is driving me crazy .
let &apos;s go over it again .
rome , roam ,
a basket took him far from home .
in the desert , he is the son .
he &apos;s clearly talking about moses .
but zimmer &apos;s riddles always point to his payment .
maybe he wants you to part the hudson .
wait .
what ?
what does the word &quot; moses &quot; mean
in the original archaic hebrew ?
it means &quot; son . &quot;
he wants my son .
he wants barty .
no , moz , you can &apos;t .
i insist .
you risked your bond with the suit .
he , in turn , sacrificed himself for you .
it is time for me to pay the price .
i &apos;ll see him on thursday .
hey , how &apos;d you get up here ?
you can &apos;t walk in here without an appointment .
i &apos;m here to write your name on the manhattan skyline ,
mr. edwards .
and you &apos;re gonna thank me for it .
get off my property now .
mr. edwards , that building -- like your others --
is going to fall short of greatness .
oh , that &apos;s an excellent pitch .
insult me . my buildings are great .
maybe in size and number , but are they true landmarks ?
are they mentioned in the same breath
as the empire state or rockefeller center ?
that building can be your legacy .
the edwards city tower --
a monument with the promise of nowhere to go but up .
wait . you set this up ? where the hell is my security ?
william grey .
never heard of you .
oh , i &apos;ve been working abroad -- the emirates , mostly .
you &apos;re welcome to check my credentials .
oh , thanks . i definitely will .
you &apos;ll note the western european influence --
geometric , unornamented , powerful .
honesty and clarity on 70 floors .
damn it .
the roofing is inspired by the great pyramid of giza ,
eldest of the seven ancient wonders of the world .
what &apos;s the framework at the top ?
bronze @-@ toned i @-@ beams .
why hide the strength that supports the structure ?
my assistant . excuse me .
yes .
pratt &apos;s just arrived .
he sees you , this op &apos;s blown .
can you push the meeting ?
i &apos;ll try to stall him .
all right , well , try hard .
problem ?
nothing my assistant can &apos;t handle .
frank lloyd wright once said
that &quot; architecture is that great living spirit which ,
from generation to generation ... &quot;
senator pratt .
it &apos;s dierdre from the barbershop .
dierdre from the barbershop .
what are you doing here ?
oh , i live in the neighborhood .
you know , this must be fate .
when you touched my hand yesterday ,
i felt a connection .
i &apos;m not a big believer in fate .
oh , well , i &apos;m not a stalker
i &apos;m a stylist .
but more importantly , i could be your stylist .
my stylist ?
yeah , you live on camera . all those photo ops .
someone &apos;s got to make sure you look perfect .
i &apos;ll think about it .
oh , that &apos;s great because , you know ,
i cut hair for a living , and you cut ribbons , so --
i &apos;ll think about it .
okay .
we have everything we need to move forward --
blueprints , computer modeling .
i &apos;m impressed .
all right , now , if we do move forward ,
i insist we use the right materials .
the i @-@ beams need to be american standard , wide flanges .
bronze @-@ toned , as well ?
yeah .
expensive .
we can use h @-@ beams .
no , they don &apos;t have the same strength over time .
you been to the colosseum lately ?
the romans didn &apos;t skimp .
i won &apos;t skimp , either .
i &apos;m glad you snuck up here .
my pleasure .
now , if you &apos;ll excuse me , i have a busy day ahead of me .
you know how to reach me .
hi , hon .
word got out you had a new swiss army toy .
naturally , i had to have him .
okay , you know what ? you &apos;ve got your weird baby .
now it &apos;s our turn .
okay , now , if you don &apos;t come up with anything ,
barty goes home with me .
nickel @-@ plated brass . heavy rust .
bluish patina on the exposed surfaces .
i &apos;d say this key was forged , maybe ...
a decade ago .
hey , i answered your riddle . i want more .
uh , okay , this here , it could be a manufacturer &apos;s logo .
no logo . just a scratch , that &apos;s all .
that &apos;s it ?
i sacrificed my firstborn for this ?
i made no promises .
i &apos;m going back to the bureau .
you tell caffrey the riddler didn &apos;t have anything for us .
okay . bye .
yep .
the real key , please .
you caught the switch ?
what do you take me for ?
heavy corrosion .
i need to see what &apos;s underneath .
i have a solution .
so , what kind of key is that ?
it &apos;s something special .
neal , the keymaster came through .
interesting developments afoot .
i got some great information .
care to catch me up ?
thanks for setting me up .
ah , just glad you &apos;re okay .
i know how much you hate being out of the loop .
speaking of , the little guy tried to pull one over on me .
what do you mean ?
he swapped the real key with the fake one .
sneaky son of a gun thought i didn &apos;t see it ,
but i caught the trigger thumb this time .
ended up badging zimmer .
he was so fascinated with the real key ,
he made a mold of it .
i had him make me a copy .
you think neal told mozzie to make the swap ?
yes . i &apos;m sure caffrey knows about it .
i heard peter was up .
he is .
listen , about yesterday --
you don &apos;t need to apologize .
i wasn &apos;t . i meant every word of it .
i understand .
then you know what you have to do .
hey , you two .
hey . we interrupting ?
just leaving .
thanks for stopping by .
absolutely .
you look good !
oh , yeah . the miracle of the jell @-@ o diet .
neal comes bearing gifts .
oh . here .
here you go .
set this here .
&quot; beer of the month &quot; club .
yeah , i figured lifting a few pints
could be good rehabilitation for you .
yeah . thank you . thank you .
and what is this ?
it &apos;s , um --
a sling ?
yeah .
there &apos;s a fake arm in it . mozzie &apos;s gift ?
oh , he thought you could use a sling ,
and the arm &apos;s good for gaming tables in atlantic city .
it &apos;s very thoughtful .
so , jones told me about the keymaster .
turned out to be a dead end ?
yeah , he didn &apos;t give us anything .
but , you know , there &apos;s always another angle .
yeah .
you know , i @-@ i want to get back to work as soon as possible ,
and i -- i still need a little more rest .
of course .
he just lied to me , right to my face .
he didn &apos;t even grace me with his slippery avoidance techniques .
he lied to my face .
hey , diana .
city signed off on your building .
seems edwards and pratt have more pull
with the planner &apos;s office than we thought .
edwards should call his supplier soon .
great .
we &apos;ll have an agent by the phone to intercept the call .
hey , when that happens ,
can you route the call to the hospital ?
oh . got you .
i want the bronze rounds , 5 @-@ 10 model .
confirming , that &apos;s the h @-@ beams ?
that &apos;s what i said .
sorry , i &apos;m new here .
well , you might be temporary , too .
tell gary i need all this delivered first thing tomorrow .
otherwise , it &apos;s on you .
got it . thanks for your business , mr. edwards .
have an unpleasant day .
i &apos;m sorry . did you say &quot; unpleasant &quot; ?
permit approved by the city was for american standard i @-@ beams .
but you ordered cheaper goods
without approval from the planner &apos;s office .
that &apos;s a violation of building codes .
it also gives us what we need to subpoena
all of your personal bank accounts and records .
we got edwards .
excellent .
i &apos;ll be heading home as soon as i &apos;m discharged .
keep me posted .
of course .
you shuffled a lot of money around , mr. edwards .
we compared your company accounts to your own .
found some discrepancies .
probably an accounting mistake .
no .
by subbing in lower @-@ grade materials ,
you saved almost $ 150 million .
i filed the change reports .
our lab ran ink tests .
they were stamped less than a week ago .
you were never gonna report those savings to your investors .
multiple counts of bank and wire fraud .
one to five on each count , and you &apos;re looking at 25 years .
but there &apos;s a chance we can make a deal here .
what kind of deal ?
i &apos;m interested in senator pratt .
provide us with evidence you gave him kickbacks ,
and the prosecutor will know how cooperative you are .
there &apos;s also the matter of attempted murder of a federal agent .
you rigged agent burke &apos;s car to malfunction .
if you had any proof , you would have led with that .
he &apos;s taking his chances on a lenient judge .
no , he &apos;s hoping his loyalty gets back to pratt .
he &apos;s betting on him to pull strings .
it &apos;s a dead end .
i &apos;m profoundly disappointed in cole edwards .
i &apos;d had my suspicions .
i visited the fbi several days ago .
after my visit ...
pratt cuts edwards loose
and then takes credit for the bureau &apos;s win .
... today &apos;s disheartening results .
public corruption is something i cannot tolerate .
thank you .
honey .
well , look at this .
well , this can &apos;t be good .
senator pratt !
we need to talk .
edward said you are back
and you threw him under the bus .
my stance on public corruption -- is a joke ,
especially when you &apos;re at the heart of it .
that &apos;s a serious accusation .
i &apos;m aware of your situation , mr. caffrey ,
your background , your father .
what about my father ?
keep it together , neal .
you accuse me of corruption when , in fact ,
it was james bennett who was the real stain on metro p.d. --
a criminal posing as a cop .
i &apos;m sure you , of all people , can appreciate the irony .
oh , i will .
soon .
you destroyed my family 30 years ago .
i &apos;m not gonna let you do it again .
whatever you &apos;re hiding , i &apos;m gonna find it .
i &apos;m not sure about that .
your division at the fbi is undergoing restructuring
as of today .
what does he mean ?
jones , what &apos;s going on ?
what ? when ?
they &apos;re forcing you out .
pratt made calls to the attorney general .
an hour later , the director phoned me
and put early retirement on the table .
this is ridiculous .
it wasn &apos;t a choice .
a.g. made it clear .
my pension was at risk if i didn &apos;t cooperate .
you &apos;re not going anywhere .
it &apos;s the best offer i &apos;m gonna get .
and i can walk out with my head up .
reese , i did this .
this isn &apos;t about you , peter .
i signed off on the op . i knew the risks .
pratt can &apos;t get away with this .
then don &apos;t let him .
if anyone can get the bastard , it &apos;s you .
no one could ever ask for a better team
than i found in you .
thank you , sir .
thank you for your service , caffrey .
thank you , sir .
you &apos;re a real son of a bitch , neal .
but you &apos;re the best damn son of a bitch i &apos;ve ever seen .
thanks .
i could say the same for you , reese .
take care of peter .
i will .
hughes is gone ?
thanks to pratt .
we took out his biggest donor , he retaliated .
are you sure about this ?
going after pratt , for me , it &apos;s personal .
for you ...
it &apos;s personal , too .
i believe in this system , and if someone &apos;s polluting it ,
it &apos;s our job to set things right .
the senator knows we &apos;re coming .
good , because i &apos;m gonna find every dirty deal ,
every crime or cover @-@ up he &apos;s been a part of .
that &apos;s what i do .
that &apos;s what you do .
ellen must have made it when she first moved to new york .
what if it unlocks nothing ?
keys don &apos;t have existential crises .
what ? the keymaster came through ?
well , he did give me another riddle .
what did he say ?
when is a key not a key ? when it &apos;s a guide .
a guide ?
ridges on keys are numerically coded by width and height .
maybe they &apos;re coordinates .
the shapes , they look familiar .
look at the silhouette .
what does that remind you of ?
um , an o.c.d. &apos; s nightmare of assorted boxes ?
it &apos;s a cityscape , moz .
not this one .
no , but manhattan has the best skyline in the world .
these are buildings .
if we match these shapes up from the right vantage point ...
it &apos;s going to point us somewhere .
it &apos;s a map . pratt doesn &apos;t know about this .
neither does peter .
neal thinks he &apos;s in the lead here ...
but i &apos;m with him .
