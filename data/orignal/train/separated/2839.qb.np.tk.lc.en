it is true what they say : pregnant bellies look like a drum .
i &apos;m so pregnant that my guitar doesn &apos;t fit anymore .
so i &apos;m going to play my songs on this drum.it sounds really cool !
listen , listen .
smelly cat , smelly cat , what are they feeding you ?
that sounds great !
i know ! and i &apos;ve only been playing for an hour .
what are you doing here ?
i came to ask you a big favor .
don &apos;t tell me you want to keep more stuff in my uterus .
okay . now , see .
i want to name the girl baby leslie .
and frank wants to name one of the boy babies ... frank jr . , jr .
wouldn &apos;t that be frank lll ? don &apos;t get me started .
anyway , since there are three babies ... and we both got to put our names in
... we would be truly honored if you would name the other boy baby .
that &apos;s so nice !
cougar .
think about it .
the one with rachel &apos;s new dress
i left a bra drying in there .
will your son think it &apos;s yours and be traumatized ?
mommy can have a wife . daddy can have a bra .
it &apos;s time to go.see , that clock &apos;s a little fast .
we still have 17 minutes .
what can we do in 17 minutes ... twice ?
well , that &apos;s ambitious .
you can ignore that.that &apos;s your son .
believe me , when he &apos;s older , he &apos;ll understand .
i &apos;ll be right there .
this is carol and susan .
it &apos;s so nice to finally meet you .
you too .
susan will be in london next week .
i &apos;ve never been there .
i &apos;ll show you around .
great !
also , i was hoping to catch a show . any suggestions ?
there &apos;s tons of terrific stuff.i &apos;ll go with you .
look at you two bonding .
making us late for the airport .
are you all right ?
it &apos;s just us getting along is difficult for him ...
... because he doesn &apos;t like me .
come on . that &apos;s .... it &apos;s true .
how did we lose ?
do we have a baby name yet ?
no . it &apos;s so hard ! i went through this book and found nothing .
i want a name that &apos;s really strong and confident.you know ? like ... exxon !
it certainly worked for that valdez kid .
you want a strong name ? how about the hulk ?
i &apos;m not sure about hulk , but i like a name starting with &quot; the . &quot;
you want a good name , go with joey .
joey &apos;s your pal , your buddy .
where is everybody ? they &apos;re hanging out with joey !
if you &apos;re going to name him joey , you should name him chandler .
chandler &apos;s funny , sophisticated , and very lovable ...
... once you get to know him .
joey &apos;s lovable too .
but with joey , if you need him , he &apos;ll be there .
chandler will be there too . he might be a little late ...
... but he &apos;ll be there . and he &apos;ll bring you cold soda ...
... if what you need him for is that you &apos;re really hot .
what do you say ?
i like the idea of naming him after someone i love .
joey and chandler are both great names .
all right , i don &apos;t.maybe i &apos;ll just name him the hulk .
i shouldn &apos;t have mentioned it . i wanted to name my kid that .
if you hoped to sleep with joshua , which one would you wear ?
it creeps me out choosing other people &apos;s sex clothes .
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m just so excited.i &apos;ve been waiting for months .
i got my hair colored.i got new sheets . i &apos;m making him a very fancy meal .
what am i making him , by the way ?
a frisee salad with goat cheese and pine nuts ...
... wild rice , roasted asparagus and salmon en croute .
i thought i was making him filet mignon .
you decided to make salmon because you had some left over .
then you realized if you bitched , then you would stop cooking ...
... and you would have to make your famous baked potato and diet coke .
i really get crabby when i cook .
why go through all this trouble ? he &apos;s a guy .
you &apos;d serve the potato and he &apos;d still want to have sex with you .
that is not how i operate .
we &apos;ve got to get a new game .
so emily called last night .
and now you &apos;re giving me the message ?
turns out that emily is just crazy about susan .
they &apos;re going to the theater together .
they &apos;re going to dinner .
they &apos;re going horseback riding !
god , susan is so fun !
look , this is just a little too familiar .
for six months before carol and i split up ...
... all i heard was , &quot; my friend susan is so smart .
my friend susan is so funny . my friend susan is so great . &quot;
you think something could happen between emily and susan ?
hey , they &apos;re going to the gym together !
two women ... stretching !
they take a steam , things get playful . didn &apos;t you see personal best ?
no , but i &apos;m gonna !
hi ! you &apos;re crazy .
emily is straight .
how do you know ? we thought carol was straight .
yeah , definitely . i don &apos;t like the name ross .
what a weird way to kick me when i &apos;m down !
no , i meant for the baby .
what &apos;s wrong with ross ?
something like this would never happen to the hulk , you know .
that &apos;s not true .
in the incredible hulk , number 72 , dr. bruce banner found ....
you know .... never mind . my girlfriend &apos;s a lesbian .
i &apos;m definitely going to go with either joey or chandler .
you gotta pick joey ! name one famous person named chandler .
raymond chandler .
someone you didn &apos;t make up .
there are no famous joeys . except for ... joey buttafucco .
yeah , that guy really hurt us .
how about a compromise then ? what if it &apos;s ...
... chan @-@ no @-@ ey ?
joey ? think about it . he &apos;ll never be president .
there will never be a president joey .
i didn &apos;t want to bring this up .
chandler is the stupidest name i &apos;ve heard in my life !
it &apos;s not a name ! it &apos;s barely even a word .
it &apos;s like chandelier but it &apos;s not !
then , you put it together with bing and forget about it .
it &apos;s a stupid , stupid , non @-@ name !
you &apos;re right . i have a horrible , horrible name .
i &apos;m sorry , man . i &apos;m sorry .
so i guess it &apos;s joey then .
this is so nice . thank you for doing this .
please ! cooking soothes me .
so dig in !
it all looks so good .
oh , my god .
i know . my god , this rice is so i am so good !
behind you .
they used to live here , and sometimes they migrate back over .
is there some way that they could not be here ? farm birds really kind of freak me out !
here we go .
there you go !
hey ! how &apos;d you do that ?
all gone .
so , farm birds , huh ?
it &apos;s my only weird thing , i swear .
i would have told you . i didn &apos;t know that they &apos;d be here .
can i serve you a little ... what ?
nothing.it &apos;s just that i know that they &apos;re still out there .
they &apos;re across the hall . that &apos;s two doors away .
it &apos;ll take them a long time to peck their way back over here .
that &apos;s not funny .
would you feel better if we went someplace else ? we could pack this stuff up and go to your apartment .
they &apos;re working on it . it &apos;s a mess .
i &apos;m staying at my parents &apos; house . we could go there .
they &apos;re out of town .
it &apos;s a huge place , and it &apos;s got this gorgeous view.it &apos;d be very romantic .
what do you say ?
yeah , that works .
they can smell the fear .
how &apos;s ben ?
i asked if he wanted to eat . he said no .
i asked if he wanted to sleep . he said no .
i asked what he wanted to do . he said no .
so he &apos;s sweeping .
any word from susan ?
she said she &apos;s having so much fun with emily .
by the by , did it ever occur to you that ...
... maybe they might be having a little too much fun ?
what &apos;s too much fun ?
the kind of fun you and susan had when we were married .
oh , my god ! you are so paranoid .
am l ? am l ?
susan is in a loving , committed relationship .
carol , so were we .
just imagine for a moment ...
... that susan meets someone , and they hit it off .
they &apos;re coming back from the theater , and they stop at a pub for drinks .
they &apos;re laughing.someone innocently touches someone else .
there &apos;s electricity.it &apos;s new . it &apos;s exciting .
are you saying there isn &apos;t the slightest possibility ... of something happening ?
maybe .
oh , my god ! i didn &apos;t really believe it until you just said it !
none of the other kids believed me , but i swear that duck pushed me .
this place is fabulous !
this is the downstairs living room .
there &apos;s two living rooms ?
growing up here , this place must have been a real babe magnet .
it would have been , but my parents just moved here .
you should know this place is a real babe magnet .
want to make out ?
why don &apos;t i put the food in the fridge ... and we can eat it later ?
that sounds like a plan .
is there a place that i could go freshen up ?
just down the hall and second door to your left .
hi , darling .
what are you doing here ?
we cut the trip short .
france sucks !
this may be a little weird , but i &apos;ve got a date here .
say no more.we &apos;ll grab some food , go upstairs and be out of your hair .
that &apos;d be great . so you didn &apos;t get to ltaly ? yep . sucks !
hi , you !
oh , my god ! i know . i can do more than cook .
i like her . she seems smart .
rachel , my parents .
so nice to meet you .
joshua , that $ 500 was for groceries .
what , this ? oh , no . that &apos;s not what it is .
okay , i work in fashion .
and this is a real dress , actually.they &apos;re wearing it in milan .
part of my job is to wear the clothes and see how people respond .
then i report back to my superiors at bloomingdale &apos;s .
obviously , in this case ... i am going to report back :
&quot; u.s.a. not ready . &quot;
maybe in l.a.
there you go !
have you kids eaten yet ?
we were going to do that after .
i mean , next .
why don &apos;t we all get something to eat ?
no use wasting this baby just lying around the house .
so we &apos;ll go eat.you &apos;ll wear that .
we &apos;ll be eating and , of course , you &apos;ll be wearing that .
i am sorry about what i said .
nope , you &apos;re right . it is a ridiculous name !
it &apos;s not bad.yes , it is !
from now on , i have no first name .
you &apos;re just bing ?
i have no name .
so what are we supposed to call you ?
okay , for now , temporarily , you can call me ...
... clint .
no way are you cool enough to pull off &quot; clint . &quot;
what name am l cool enough to pull off ?
gene .
it &apos;s clint.it &apos;s clint !
bye , gene .
it &apos;s clint !
what &apos;s up with gene ?
you wore your nightie to dinner ?
the best part was when the waiter spilled water down my back .
i jumped up and my boob popped out .
it &apos;s all right . i got nice boobs .
i just picked up a message from emily .
she and susan are going to a poetry reading together .
so ?
so ? poetry ?
susan &apos;s gay.they &apos;re being gay together !
emily &apos;s straight.oh , wake up !
carol really messed you up .
excuse me ? she turned you into this untrusting , crazy , jealous ... sycophant !
so i don &apos;t know what &quot; sycophant &quot; means , but the rest is right .
what are you talking about ? i am not a crazy , jealous person .
she &apos;s right .
when we were together , you got upset about mark , and there was nothing .
this makes sense.it does not !
sure it does
in high school , you weren &apos;t jealous at all ... even though all your girlfriends cheated on you .
so up until &apos; 92 , &apos; 93 , he was very trusting .
then &apos; 94 hit , carol left him , and bam ! paranoid city !
absolutely ! this is so fun !
this is not fun !
all we &apos;re trying to say is ... don &apos;t let what happened with carol ruin what you &apos;ve got with emily .
the &apos; 92 ross wouldn &apos;t .
i still think i was right about that mark thing .
well , you know what ? i hope emily is a lesbian .
drumroll .
all right .
help ! am i a mark or a john ?
you &apos;re not tall enough to be a mark .
but you might make a good barney .
look , i am serious.tomorrow at 3 : 30 , i &apos;m going to the courthouse .
you &apos;re going through with this ?
this name has held me back my entire life .
it &apos;s why kids picked on me and why i never do well with women .
so tomorrow , i &apos;ll either be mark johnson or john markson .
you &apos;ve got problems because of you , not your name !
this has got to stop ! chandler is a great name .
in fact ....
i &apos;m sorry , i know you wanted me to name the baby joey .
i &apos;m going to name the baby chandler .
really ? but you have to keep the name too .
okay , thanks !
you want to hug it out ?
i &apos;m going to go tell frank and alice right now !
bye , pheebs !
nice luggage .
i was going to say .
i missed you too .
thanks , i had a great time .
so did l .
