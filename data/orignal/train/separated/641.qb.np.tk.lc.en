i &apos;m in possession of the only thing
that could one day exonerate you ...
a full confession of my own .
&quot; vito splendido &quot; made me an offer ,
and i &apos;m thinking about taking it .
jack encouraged me to go .
i think it &apos;s odd that he &apos;s trying to push you to leave
now that emily &apos;s single .
you &apos;re trying to manipulate me .
no , i &apos;m just trying to get you to open your eyes .
daniel and i forced my father out of &quot; voulez . &quot;
if there was any way i could extricate you
from this new battle with victoria , i would .
it &apos;s time i put something to bed .
pascal , i &apos;ve got victoria &apos;s trump card .
i received your gift .
i will never betray you again .
the letter &apos;s not enough to incriminate the graysons ,
but pascal has a piece of the puzzle that i don &apos;t .
aiden .
&quot; twm &quot; is trevor warren mathis .
pascal was talking about my father .
as children , we flinch at the sight of blood ,
not yet realizing it means family , loyalty ,
and is the essence of life .
but for all its virtue ...
father ?
... there is the unavoidable reality
that blood is often the child of pain ...
... and a violent reminder that anything can be taken away
in the blink of an eye .
no !
you all right ?
yeah .
yeah , i @-@ i &apos;m fine .
thinking about the past doesn &apos;t make for restful sleep .
you know , i just want to march next door
and ask that bastard what he did to my father ,
but i know that would put pascal on alert .
well , especially since he and victoria
are already conspiring against me .
come on . i made some coffee .
nolan hacked into my father &apos;s phone and employment records ,
even looked into the police investigation after his arrest .
nothing can link him to pascal or anybody
in the days leading up to his murder , so ...
that letter &apos;s still a mystery .
well , then ...
maybe we should talk about that time ...
since we have nothing else to go on .
oh , what &apos;s there to talk about ?
we thought my sister had run away .
and while we &apos;re reeling from that , flight 197 happened .
uh , the police came &apos; round ,
asking questions about who put the bomb on the plane .
and when my father shot himself ,
it just confirmed what everybody thought .
that he was a terrorist .
which i thought myself for many years ...
until i found out colleen had been kidnapped
and he was forced to do what he did ...
which just made his suicide even more shameful .
he took the coward &apos;s way out . she needed a hero .
well , there is one more thing we could try .
but i can &apos;t do it alone .
whatever you need .
morning .
waking up to you these past few mornings ...
i &apos;ve missed feeling like this .
you were wasted on conrad .
it was a mistake .
marrying for all the wrong reasons
resulted in such misery , hmm .
let me deal with emily .
no . i will .
i &apos;ll come back .
yes ?
mr. grayson is here for you , mr. lemarchal .
look , i get why you &apos;re mad , okay ,
but this silent treatment &apos;s lasted three days .
and now that i &apos;m back at &quot; voulez , &quot;
i want you there , too .
you used me to turn margaux against jack .
i just tried to get you both to see the light about that guy .
i &apos;m sorry for the way i did it , all right ?
just so you know , your little plan didn &apos;t work .
i &apos;m helping jack with his move .
char , i &apos;m not making this up , okay ?
you know how tight he is with emily .
tell me you &apos;ve never wondered what their connection is .
i don &apos;t care .
carl &apos;s my nephew .
and jack has never been anything but nice to me .
and what if you &apos;re blindly defending the man
who &apos;s helping emily demolish this family ?
could you ever forgive yourself ?
ah , i sense the stench of romance is in the air .
i won &apos;t talk about her .
that &apos;s not victoria i was referencing .
well , it seems that the only kindness you &apos;ll grant me
after i gave you leverage to get into her bed
is to keep her out of this conversation .
i owe you nothing , okay ?
you can look me in the eye
and tell me that you &apos;re reneging on our deal
instead of hiding out and playing house .
and while you nurse the wounds of your new loss ,
i &apos;m already breaking in to the south american market .
you wouldn &apos;t know where to begin .
alberto loya jumped at the mention of my name ...
much like people once did at the mention of yours .
our business is done .
hello , mother .
aiden .
this is emily ... my fiancee .
it was my late husband &apos;s grandmother &apos;s .
i &apos;ve loved it ever since he put it on my finger .
and have you set a date ?
no . no , not yet .
oh , it &apos;s so dark in here . you never open the curtains .
no . people still talk .
oh , well , i -- i doubt that .
is that why i haven &apos;t seen you in eight years ?
well , emily , uh , made me realize
i &apos;ve not been dealing with everything that happened , so ...
that &apos;s -- that &apos;s why we &apos;re here , yeah ?
then maybe you can help him understand
why this subject is best left alone , emily .
mum , well ... maybe it would be good to talk ,
you know , help -- help deal with things and --
and -- and you , too , you know ?
um ... i mean , you &apos;ve --
you &apos;ve been holing yourself up in here --
this is my life .
you wanted out . you got out .
i knew we shouldn &apos;t have come here .
i don &apos;t want to cause her any more pain , emily .
yeah , but if we can find what the connection was
between pascal and your father ,
then maybe we could take some of that pain away .
guess who &apos;s the proud owner of a 30 @-@ year mortgage .
we can move in whenever we want .
congratulations , jack .
i &apos;m sorry i wasn &apos;t there .
no worries .
hey , kid .
you just got yourself a yard .
we should celebrate .
hello ?
no , i didn &apos;t know .
i &apos;m on my way , yes .
i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s okay , babe .
go ahead .
don &apos;t forget your keys .
that &apos;s right . let &apos;s get you out of the sun .
there you go . there you go .
what &apos;s wrong , jack ?
margaux &apos;s first move was re @-@ hiring daniel grayson .
his first move was trying to split us up
by telling her that i had feelings for emily .
if a woman falls for that ...
she must think there &apos;s something to it .
rudy .
rudy , my competitors read your feed ,
so , no spoiler alerts , but trust me --
this launch is gonna be beyond redic .
the program is called myclone ,
and it &apos;ll have you talking to yourself in no time .
are you romancing the blogosphere ?
see , techies love it when you call .
it makes them feel so ... retro .
and speaking of ,
my lawyer sent over our business contract --
old @-@ school hard copies .
i still can &apos;t believe
we are going into business together .
well , believe it , partner .
partner ?
yo , why does this say that
you plan to own 70 % of the company ?
the program won &apos;t be market @-@ ready
until i iron it out , and , uh ,
i &apos;m assuming all the financial risk here , so ...
you have plenty of bank . investing in this --
it doesn &apos;t put you in the poorhouse ,
but it does put you back on top , right ?
excuse me ? - your last idea --
if memory serves , it landed you on my cellblock .
and before that , was i even born yet ?
that &apos;s a low blow , i mean , even for you .
look , any other investor
would ask for much more and care a lot less .
well , maybe i should find out for myself .
i got your message .
what &apos;s so urgent it couldn &apos;t wait ?
i &apos;ll be back .
why is my brother in miami to negotiate a deal
as important as increasing our stake in the americas ?
i was right here .
well , i &apos;ve decided to step down in two years .
i think it &apos;s time for me to enjoy other things .
i sent gideon &apos; cause he is to take over .
you &apos;re grooming him to run things ?
he has shown loyalty and determination .
you pulled away at every turn .
i got into the best schools on merit ,
worked from the bottom up at our competitors ,
and approached you only when i was ready .
that &apos;s why i asked to launch &quot; voulez &quot; in the states .
this has never been my final stop .
then why make plans to become
a part @-@ time wife and stepmother , huh ?
of course you can &apos;t comprehend a woman
who can work and have a life .
that &apos;s why you came back for victoria .
i imagine she &apos;s sitting at home waiting for you .
i have work to do .
it &apos;s been far too long .
what a surprise , albeit an honor ,
to receive a visit from the queen herself .
you look well , mason .
and you still lie elegantly , victoria .
my skin is sallow and my wit squandered ,
though i take solace knowing that
i walk in the shackled footsteps of the greats --
cervantes , wilde , voltaire ,
all imprisoned as i.
now , to what do i owe this pleasure ?
emily thorne --
she &apos;s been sniffing around my family &apos;s history .
and as i take a step back , i can &apos;t help but notice
her ties to one thing in particular .
i can &apos;t imagine what .
now , you &apos;re the premier expert on the subject .
did emily &apos;s name ever come up in your research ?
i will say this .
i was very interested in emily at one point .
what was the genesis of your suspicion ?
if you think i &apos;m going to spill my secrets for nothing ,
your hubris is as offensive
as my former cellmate &apos;s grooming habits .
oh , well , what would our visit be
without a hint of the mercenary ?
what do you want ?
a brunch of lobster benedict and a gibson
at bella monica &apos;s ...
as free man by , say ...
end of the month ?
oh , i &apos;d love a table by the window ...
if you can swing it .
guard !
all right , let &apos;s go , treadwell .
oh , did i wake you ?
no , no , i was just gonna grab a glass of water .
i don &apos;t sleep most nights , so i clean .
i &apos;m sorry about today .
aiden &apos;s just looking for closure .
you &apos;re marrying a man with the broken heart
of a 12 @-@ year @-@ old boy .
and i don &apos;t know how to help you heal it .
well , that &apos;s ... sort of what bonded us .
my father died when i was young , too .
i &apos;m sorry to hear that , emily ...
though try to imagine such a loss made worse by scandal .
trevor and aiden were so close .
spent hours in the shed doing all sorts of projects .
after that plane crash ,
trevor shut him out and hid back there alone .
he must have felt so abandoned .
still , at least he defended his father ,
even though his classmates called him a murderer .
and what did he get in return ?
the honor of finding trevor dead .
aiden found him ?
i never knew .
everything changed so quickly --
his sister running away , his father taking his life ,
and me trying to wrap my head around
that version of a stranger i married .
i &apos;m glad he &apos;s found a little piece of happiness with you .
i can only hope the same for colleen .
your daughter ?
i know it &apos;s been years ...
but i hope the life she ran away to is a happy one .
i am flattered , mr. grayson , but ...
my negotiations with pascal and lemarchal media
are too far along .
we are in final talks .
your south american media conglomerate
is the belle of the ball , and yet your friend pascal
didn &apos;t deem you worthy to meet in person .
he had pressing business in new york .
he &apos;s a busy man .
well , that business is screwing my ex @-@ wife .
and he &apos;s also screwing you
by not giving you full disclosure .
within two years , you &apos;ll be doing business
with his kid , not pascal .
where did you hear this ?
i overheard gideon throwing his new title around with the concierge .
specious bravado has been the kid &apos;s calling card since he was 15 ...
whereas ...
this is mine .
call me optimistic , but ...
welcome to grayson media .
oh , i can feel the anger from here .
my father is stepping down
and handing over the company to my idiot brother .
which one ? not -- not gideon ?
i &apos;m sure he has his reasons .
well , they &apos;re obvious .
he &apos;s a man . i &apos;m not .
and while gideon &apos;s only learned how to use the corporate card ,
i &apos;ve studied every single deal pascal has ever made .
i &apos;ve built a successful business ,
but yet the only thing that man sees
is me throwing my life away for jack .
don &apos;t let him get to you . okay ? he &apos;s not worth it .
no , you &apos;re right .
you &apos;re right .
this is gonna bruise .
i &apos;m sorry . i didn &apos;t mean for you to see this side of me .
i kind of like it .
i &apos;ll get you some ice , okay ?
yeah . thank you .
jack .
what a nice surprise .
you okay ?
yeah , my father -- he makes me so angry .
what did he do ?
no , forget about it .
why ? &apos; cause daniel talked you down ?
yeah . i saw that .
daniel and i are friends .
i don &apos;t like jealous men .
i &apos;ll see you later .
hello ?
bad time ?
no contact -- that was our agreement .
when exactly do you intend to keep up your end of the deal ?
when i &apos;m finished .
you were almost killed after a marriage
i can only imagine was supposed to
have a very different honeymoon .
i could have been stuck in here forever ,
spotting a guy named little shiv on the bench press .
i want to renegotiate .
you have no leverage .
ah , but i do .
i had a visitor .
we gabbed about old times ,
laughed about a certain juvie girl .
what do you want ?
to know how you intend to keep your promise to me .
show me your hand within 24 hours ,
or i &apos;ll show my visitor mine .
ticktock goes the clarke .
mason knows who you are ?
yes , and he threatened to expose me ,
so i shut him down .
oh , and she &apos;s being delicate .
you framed mason for crimes he didn &apos;t commit
and then forced him to confess to them .
why would he agree to that ?
&apos;cause he &apos;s a celeb author with only one best seller .
she promised him the exclusive rights to her story of revenge .
now victoria is tempting him .
i &apos;m worried he &apos;ll talk .
so , ems , what do we do ? you &apos;re in jolly ole .
we can &apos;t exactly traipse in there .
they record every conversation .
no . no , they don &apos;t .
no . they don &apos;t
jack .
i &apos;m not gonna let this hack railroad you , emily , okay ?
hey , i heard there was a new homeowner in town .
charlie , taking a break from distracting my juvenile ,
who , once again , has gone delinquent .
yes , nolan , i thought i &apos;d see my nephew
and maybe the new house .
carl &apos;s out with stevie ,
and i can &apos;t -- i can &apos;t leave right now .
well , if you &apos;re starting to pack ,
i &apos;ve got some boxes in the car .
i &apos;m , uh -- i &apos;m sorry , charlotte ,
but , um , we &apos;re kind of busy right now .
was that emily ?
and who &apos;s trying to railroad her ?
i &apos;ll , uh -- i &apos;ll have to call you later .
thanks for the boxes .
yeah , sure .
what happened ? my mom stand you up ?
she &apos;s late .
the great pascal lemarchal
wrapped around a woman &apos;s finger .
i could say the same .
my daughter fires you ,
and you run back at the first opportunity .
you &apos;re totally oblivious
to what an amazing daughter you have , aren &apos;t you ?
i give her credit where it &apos;s due .
no , you don &apos;t .
no , y @-@ you &apos;ve got her pigeonholed at this magazine
when she &apos;s capable of so much more .
you were always so fond of her .
yeah , i still am ...
as my business partner .
she &apos;s got a boyfriend , remember ?
it &apos;s hard to recall since she never brings him around .
i met him briefly at the opera .
yeah , and i &apos;m sure he seemed like a --
a real nice guy .
isn &apos;t he ?
what i do know is that
she &apos;s always wanted your love and respect .
and i just hope that she &apos;s not
settling for something less than she deserves
because you never told her that she was worthy .
all right . see you around .
when i heard i had new counsel ,
i &apos;d never imagined i &apos;d rate the one and only stevie grayson .
have we met before ?
no . but i certainly dined on your reputation
when i was a young journalist
covering nightlife for the daily news .
your antics inspired the poetry of prose .
and your antics earned you a life sentence .
well , at least you still have the bite of a stiff drink .
now , since i &apos;m sure you &apos;re presenting as my lawyer
so this conversation can &apos;t be recorded ,
my burning question is , for whose team are you playing ?
i &apos;m here to help emily follow through
on the promise amanda clarke made to you .
emily ? wow .
she &apos;s such a devoted friend .
this is a motion to set aside your conviction .
you &apos;ll be out in a few months .
ms. thorne has also transferred funds
into your canteen account for sundries .
sundries ?
i &apos;m looking for a lot more
than some salve to brighten my complexion .
it &apos;s the only option .
is it ?
tell ms. thorne ...
i &apos;m going with what &apos;s behind door &quot; g. &quot;
no !
no , father !
no . no , father .
aiden ?
you know , i ...
i haven &apos;t been back in here ...
since ...
you know , every time i &apos;d , uh , look out my bedroom window
and see our code on the door ,
i &apos;d just hate him a little bit more .
&quot; boys only . &quot;
yeah , we &apos;d devised this -- this code
where you &apos;d just write the bottom halves of letters and ...
silly , really .
he made me feel like we were
sharing some -- some great secret ...
when , in fact ,
he was the one keeping secrets from us .
well , you &apos;re keeping some , too .
aiden , you have to tell your mom that colleen is dead .
i can &apos;t .
i couldn &apos;t bring myself to tell her
when i thought that she &apos;d been kidnapped .
my mother &apos;s hope for her children is all she has left .
i can &apos;t take that away from her .
but you could offer her something different --
some answers about the man that she loved .
you &apos;re not gonna leave this , are you ?
have i ever ?
what is it ?
i &apos;ve never seen this before ,
and i &apos;d know because this table
is the last thing my father and i worked on .
&quot; oscar chapman . &quot;
who is that ?
i don &apos;t know .
but my father obviously wanted me to .
whatever you &apos;re holding over mason treadwell , let it go .
we need him out of jail .
oh , the man confessed ... to murder
and sabotaging the government plane you boarded
in the desperate attempt to turn state &apos;s evidence ,
and , lest we forget his most heinous sin ,
trying to frame me for it all ...
on my wedding day .
which is why you had him put away .
i assure you , i did nothing of the sort .
or is this lunacy
a ruse to enter my suite ?
oh , what &apos;s the matter ? french grass not greener ?
were we not bound by our sins , i would be nowhere near you .
emily &apos;s interested in flight 197 .
and i think mason knows why .
oh , he knows nothing but how to spin a tale .
and as long as emily is your enemy ,
well , she &apos;s an ally to me .
hello ?
yes .
are you sure ?
thank you .
guess who visited mason in jail today .
stevie .
it seems like your ex @-@ wife is up to her old tricks .
and if she &apos;s working for emily , god help her .
it was good to meet you .
i wish you only happiness .
thank you , mrs. mathis .
i &apos;ll be outside .
yeah .
she &apos;s a lovely girl .
yeah .
yeah , she is .
mum , please sit down .
i need to talk to you .
i @-@ i haven &apos;t been honest with you .
emily and i ...
we aren &apos;t together .
i needed someone to come with me ,
and she was the only person that i would have by my side .
why lie to me ?
i just ... wanted to give you some happy news after my absence .
i &apos;m sorry .
i understood when you left home at 16 .
life here was horrible .
and you kept in touch as well as young men do .
but when you disappeared just like your sister ,
i wondered what i &apos;d done wrong .
colleen didn &apos;t run away , mum .
some men took her .
and they promised that they &apos;d bring her back
if dad planted a bomb on the plane .
eight years ago ,
i tracked down the men who had taken her ,
and i found her .
i &apos;m sorry , mum .
she &apos;s gone .
and what about the men ?
also dead .
good .
i never let myself believe your father was a monster .
i &apos;m sorry .
you snuck out .
what about nolan ?
aren &apos;t you worried about jeopardizing your partnership ?
i think you mean internship .
he tried to get me to sign a totally bogus contract .
but why would he do that ?
&apos;cause he knows myclone is next @-@ gentwitter level ,
and he wants to get his name trending .
i thought we were tight ,
but it seems the only person that guy jumps for in a minute &apos;s notice
is that blond girl ... emily .
and i know they &apos;ve never even
ever .
though she has many men at her beck and call ,
including my friend jack .
porter , right ?
yeah .
yeah , nolan had me help him the day i got here ...
some file @-@ decoding emergency at a law firm .
jack .
yeah .
so , they have their little gang , and i guess i &apos;m not a part of .
tell me about it .
actually , i know someone who can help you .
who ?
my brother .
i had you when i was 19 .
i didn &apos;t know how to be a father .
instead of raising you , i raised an empire .
and our relationship suffered .
and it was easier to have a connection with your sons .
no . it &apos;s just , by my second marriage ,
i was a better father .
margaux .
my awkwardness with you ,
it &apos;s because of my regret .
what is this ?
my 5 @-@ year plan for the company .
we should be further along with new media acquisitions .
you &apos;re being too lax .
and your position on the dst deal last year ...
that was a mistake .
a mistake .
i would &apos;ve handled it differently , papa .
then tell me .
oscar chapman was a free lance reporter based in london ,
worked for lemarchal media in &apos; 93
died in a car accident .
it &apos;s another dead end .
don &apos;t lose hope yet .
well , why not ?
this whole thing &apos;s been a waste of time .
you know that &apos;s not true .
you reconnected with your mother .
yeah . yeah , you &apos;re right .
i can &apos;t believe you &apos;ve been carrying all of that .
emily ... thank you .
i know you have a crisis here with victoria closing in ,
but ...
you stayed by me , so ...
we &apos;ve always been there for each other .
i &apos;ve missed you , too .
open the gate !
now !
what the hell kind of game are you playing ?
i assume this visit isn &apos;t an overdue &quot; thank you &quot;
for signing over the deed to grayson manor .
you never gave a damn about that house .
you &apos;ve been after my family from the start .
what &apos;s your interest in mason treadwell ?
my clients are none of your concern .
oh , i thought you &apos;d clam up ...
so i brought along an old friend .
there was a time when the smell alone
was enough to make you sloppy and so , so chatty .
get the hell out of my room .
i probably should ...
... since anyone you try to take into your confidence
ends up deceased .
or didn &apos;t you know that mason treadwell
was found dead in his cell tonight ?
what ?
you meddled where you shouldn &apos;t ,
with no concern for the consequence .
you may be sober , but you still can &apos;t think clearly .
watch your back , stevie ...
and those of the people you love .
if my , uh , high @-@ school french serves ,
allow me to answer . your son was busy
blatantly trading your name for favors
and acting like his ascension was a fait accompli .
he wasn &apos;t to share that .
mm . dommage .
well , since he &apos;s already botched that task ,
allow me to congratulate you on your retirement ...
though announcing it so early is quite the gamble .
i mean , imagine the panic , the rebel through your company ,
making it easy for vultures to swoop in and feast .
and you are one of them .
ah , foul of me , perhaps ,
but your loyal deal was my first carcass .
the acquisition will be announced in the &quot; journal &quot; tomorrow .
daniel .
my father is grooming me to take over the lemarchal empire .
really ?
so i wanted to pop by and thank you .
i didn &apos;t do anything .
you &apos;ve been a good friend ...
beside me for the whole ride .
since i was a 16 @-@ year @-@ old girl
complaining about her father .
until right now , tonight .
yeah .
you know , you were always special .
that &apos;s why i challenged you
to every impossible ski slope when we were kids .
you just -- you just kept winning .
yeah .
we &apos;ll make a great team , daniel .
and if i &apos;m going to run the company ,
i &apos;ll need greatness by my side .
so ...
come on , let &apos;s celebrate then .
hey . you haven &apos;t been answering your call--
what &apos;s going on ?
i ...
i heard mason died in ... in ...
i &apos;m in over my head here .
this damn place , jack . i &apos;m sorry .
don &apos;t apologize .
you have nothing to do with what happened to mason .
i thought i was helping , and i --
and i ended up hurting someone .
god , i never wanted you to see me like this .
i want you to -- i want you to go .
just go please .
i &apos;m getting you out of here .
no . oh , no .
no , i don &apos;t --
jack .
i don &apos;t want to be the first bad memory in your new house .
you won &apos;t be .
i &apos;m taking you home to l.a. , okay ?
come with me .
please come with me , and we could start over .
and you could bring emily
&apos;cause she has to stop this .
she can &apos;t .
this is everything to her .
and i &apos;m --
i &apos;m coming back here to help her finish .
maybe daniel &apos;s right .
you love emily , don &apos;t you ?
i miss you .
it &apos;s been an eventful few days .
yeah , i agree .
conrad has decided to declare war .
well , then , so have i.
i ran stevie grayson out of town ,
and now it &apos;s time to test my theory about emily thorne .
seems we &apos;re both at war .
we have reservations .
we &apos;re not going to dinner .
what ? no . get me out . i &apos;ll be dead .
get me out of here !
nolan ross .
and you said you didn &apos;t need sundries .
god , your skin . you just look so alive .
all credit due to emily &apos;s face cream ,
which contained a japanese herb
that makes the body mimic death for 12 hours .
what the hell ?
we &apos;re outside of the gates ?
well , that was your request , right ?
cash and a new identity .
my private jet will whisk you away to the maldives ,
where emily has provided you with the perfect writer &apos;s retreat --
a bungalow off the grid .
which makes me a part of one of ms. thorne &apos;s infamous plans
in a story that she &apos;s obviously still very committed to finish .
we need to know that we have your allegiance .
i only bartered with victoria
because , frankly , i &apos;d lost faith .
but ...
consider me reborn . dead in a way , maybe .
you know , i never thought i would say this , but ...
it &apos;s good to see you , mason .
and what shall we talk about
in our soon to be resumed ride to the field ?
oh , well , i &apos;ve got a few questions about another dead reporter .
ever heard of a oscar chapman ?
hey , nolan .
what ?
yeah , i &apos;ll tell him .
okay , bye .
what ? has mason been neutralized ?
he &apos;s in the air .
but before he left ,
he told nolan that oscar chapman faked his own death .
you don &apos;t think he just wants us chasing loose tails ?
what , and further delay his magnum opus ? no way .
the man who might know pascal &apos;s connection could still be alive .
then we better pray we can find him .
