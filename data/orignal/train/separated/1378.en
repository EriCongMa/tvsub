I love a good nor'easter.
I would love to meet the person who installed this roof.
What are you doing here so early?
Traffic's terrible.
Maura, headquarters is, like, less than a mile away.
Well, I was reviewing protocols for Hope's clinics,
and I was hoping to drop them off before work.
And...VoilÃ .
For you for tomorrow night.
Tomorrow night? What's tomorrow night?
Oh, no. You are not getting out of it.
Getting out of what?
The minuteman mystery writers conference.
You promised.
Yes! That's tomorrow night. Fantastic.
It'll be fun.
You know, there's a panel discussion on dramatic theory.
And I really believe that the insight
of professional writers will improve my understanding
of internal structure better.
I haven't decided yet whether or not aristotle's "Poetics" or --
What if it gets rained out?
It's inside.
Oh, great! Rizzoli.
Isles.
Jennie tate, 32.
What is a patient doing in here?
And frankly, where the hell is here?
Here is a new cancer wing.
Whole building's been closed for four months for renovation.
Jennie was an overnight chemotherapy patient
in the adjoining building.
A nurse came in and changed her iv at 3:45 this morning.
When she looked in on her again at 6:45, Jennie was gone.
Right around the time the workers found her.
She may have been exercising.
You know, a recent article In the "Journal of oncology"suggests
that moderate exercise Can improve the effects of chemotherapy.
Any reports of her going for a walk?
No.
Any cameras?
No cameras, and no one saw her leave the ward.
We have lights coming.
The impalement appears to be the only injury.
You know, she may have fallen, but I can't be sure until I --
until you perform the autopsy.
Very funny, but true.
What's with the white rose? Was she carrying that?
No one I interviewed mentioned it.
Find out if there were roses in Jennie's room.
If there were, find out who sent 'em.
Jane.
Frankie said Jennie didn't have flowers in her room.
What about the other patients?
No flowers.
So where'd this white rose come from?
Push the button.
Push the button. Push the button.
Why?
"cause he's right behind me.
Who?
Who?
Him!
Oh! Hey. Wait.
uh, sorry.
You're running from him because he invited you to a concert?
Yes. I went to his house for what he called "The big game."
Do you know he does taxidermy?
Taxidermy?
Oh, yeah. Little mice.
He even has a favorite -- st. Kilda.
All right, well, I mean, you know, that's...
Odd, but harmless.
He dresses them up in seasonal costumes.
Skiing, surfing, leaf raking.
Back to the game. Sox?
The national shinty championships.
Kent was wearing a jersey and a kilt.
Well, special occasional, championship and all.
Yeah. That's -- that's normal.
He had one for me.
A jersey?
I wish.
At least he didn't have one for his mouse.
Wrong again, friend.
Oh, yeah.
Come on.
Detective Rizzoli, there's a woman here with information
about the homicide at the hospital.
Okay. Um, where is she? The interview room?
Interrogation room. Interview room's flooded.
All right, thanks.
Samantha Caspary?
Hi. I'm detective Rizzoli. This is sergeant --
what can you tell me about the murder at the Mallon hospital?
...Detective Korsak.
Was she a patient?
Where was the body found? Was she thrown from the roof?
Are you a relative or a friend?
What? No. No, no.
So, what is your interest in this case?
So sorry. I tend to get carried away.
I'm in town for the mystery writers conference.
So you're a writer.
Yes, which is why when I heard about your case,
I just had to come in.
Okay. Um...
We don't do interviews.
So I'll, uh, get an officer and he'll escort you...
But I can help you...
...To the front.
...If you just tell me about the case.
Uh, I think you're a little bit confused.
We ask the questions.
How is it exactly you think you can help us?
I know who did it.
You do.
The victim was impaled, right?
And the killer left flowers behind.
Just cut to the chase, ms. Caspary.
You are looking for a ghost.
As the story goes, Hannah Rose was a patient at the hospital.
Angered by her untimely death,
she came back as a ghost and killed several people.
How many is several?
I don't know.
I heard the story secondhand.
Actually, it might've been third-hand
on a visit to the U.S. long time ago.
And I was told that the doctor who was treating the patients
was found impaled on an iron post.
Multiple murders, a ghost killer --
Sounds like something I would've heard about,
but I haven't.
Nobody has,
which is why it's too much of a coincidence
to be...coincidence.
Okay, I'll have someone look into the story.
Great.
I can't find anything in writing,
and the Mallon hospital
won't let me anywhere near their archives.
So you thought you'd come to us
and we'd look in the archives for you?
Well, I must confess, I was rather hoping
that my information would help you,
and you would return the favor.
Anything helpful from the Caspary woman?
Oh, yeah, if we're looking for the headless horseman
or if we're gonna take a ride in the mystery machine?
No.
Okay, what have we got so far?
Well, Jennie Tate was a data entry clerk
with an insurance company.
Now because of her illness,
she was on extended sick leave for the last six months.
Husband?
Charles. He's an actuary with the same company.
Co-worker said they were good, hard-working people.
What about the hospital?
No threats or any other violent incidents.
Nina's still running background on the employees.
Will you have Nina check the other patients
in Jennie's chemotherapy group?
Yeah.
All right.
Those archives could hold the key to a fascinating story.
That might be true, but this is a homicide investigation...
Hi. You looking for me?
No.
You've got Samantha Caspary.
Samantha Caspary, potential crazy person.
Oh, no, no, no. She is an author with a PHD from Oxford.
Wrote a captivating best-selling biography on Dr. Joseph Bell.
The Scottish lecturer
who was the inspiration for Sherlock Holmes.
If I say, "Wow, I'd really love to read that,"
Can we talk about the case?
Jennie Tate was in partial remission.
Her cancer was responding to a rather new combination of drugs.
Did the drugs cause her death?
The drug levels in her blood
were well below fatal toxicity levels.
Also, there was no evidence of sexual assault.
And the degree of blunt force trauma
is consistent with a fall.
What about that giant piece of iron bar sticking out of her chest?
Did that have anything to do with her death?
Well, technically, that was the instrumentality,
but the cause of death was drowning.
The bar pierced her pulmonary artery,
her lungs filled with blood, and she drowned.
Could this have been an accident?
Well, those drugs do produce a mild state of disorientation.
So it seemed possible, until I noticed this.
These small lacerations couldn't be seen earlier
because they didn't bleed.
These are from the rose.
Yes.
So our killer watched Jennie die
and then pressed her hand around the rose.
It's not an accident or a ghost.
Excuse me. Dr. Isles?
Yes.
I'm Santha Caspary.
I know who you are. It is a pleasure to meet you.
I've always wanted to meet you.
I do hope I'm not being too forward,
but do you have time for a coffee?
I really don't.
Of course. You must be so busy.
It's just that I have read so many of your forensic papers.
Really?
Oh, yes.
Your paper on the effect of immersion on the rate of decay
could've been a short story.
Do you do any other kind of writing?
Well, I have written a few short stories
for my creative writing class.
Aha. Well, I'm here for the writers conference.
Maybe we could meet for dinner or drinks?
I could pick your brain, and you can show me your short stories.
I'd love that.
Ultrasound to radiology...
Our killer used this building's history to cover a murder.
I cannot understand how people believe in ghosts.
They're just trying to deal with the finality of death.
Probably understand it a lot more
if they saw what we saw every day.
Oh, that might be too much understanding.
But I don't think it's crazy
to believe in a certain life force
that doesn't die with a physical body.
Oh, I didn't know you and Kiki joined a cult.
That's pretty strong words for someone who followed
the departed Barry Frost all over town.
I just saw him 'cause I wanted to see him.
Or maybe it's that energy I'm talking about.
We've all felt it one time or another,
whether we want to admit it or not.
I miss him.
Me, too.
Jennie Tate was part of a cancer drug program
that Mallon hospital recently agreed to underwrite.
We understand that she was in remission.
She was one of our first success stories.
And we all feel terrible about the incident.
It wasn't an incident, Ms. Najafi. It was a homicide.
A homicide?
Yes. What did you think happened?
I don't know, a-a terrible accident.
We're gonna need Jennie's medical records,
The hospital security log, list of all employees.
I need to call our legal department.
While you're at it, could you tell them we also need
their records of any lawsuits pending,
any threats against the hospital or staff?
Anything that would make the hospital a target for revenge.
Wait. You think this could have something to do
with the hospital?
We do.
Are you familiar with the hateful Hannah story?
One of our senior board members told me that ridiculous tale.
Can we speak to him, please?
He's no longer with us.
Do you know where we can find him?
I'm sorry. I mean, he died.
Like I said, he was a senio board member.
Does anybody else know the story?
I hope not. It could ruin our hospital.
Really? A ghost story?
Please stop saying "Ghost."
In 1905, that story nearly caused
the financial ruin of this hospital.
That was a long time ago, Ms. Najafi.
People will come back to a hospital
if they get an infection, sergeant.
In fact, it's expected.
But no one will come to a haunted hospital.
We'll be discreet, but we have to check out every lead,
even if it involves a story none of us believes.
Yes?
A nurse heard screams coming from the renovation site.
Our security guard won't go near it.
To the right?
Shit!
Jane.
Russell Morgan, the oncologist in Jennie Tate's treatment.
If someone wanted Dr. Morgan and Jennie Tate dead,
there are easier ways.
Why the elaborate scheme?
To throw suspicion off themselves,
like blaming cousin Larry.
Except ghosts don't exists.
True, which probably means someone's trying to get back
at the hospital for some reason we haven't discovered yet.
Hey, the construction on the new wing
is three months behind schedule.
Well, the contract might've had a penalty for late completion.
Which would be invalid if the hospital contributed
to the delays because of, oh, I don't know,
a murder investigation?
I'll look into it first thing in the morning.
Hey, Frankie, why don't you and I stay
On Jennie Tate and Dr. Morgan?
Can you ask Nina to check for any malpractice lawsuits?
Maybe somebody was unhappy with the care they received.
Why don't you just tell Kent you don't want to go?
It's not that easy.
Kent has this way of making me feel bad.
Then go. It's just a couple hours.
Will you go with me?
No.
You see how easy that was?
Okay. Maura is done with Dr. Morgan's autopsy.
Hey, what do you think about this Samantha Caspary?
Our nosy writer?
A few ghost murders would be good for future book sales.
Yeah, but why walk in here and tell us about
the ghost stories if she's the one behind it all?
Maybe the creepy he from the deep told her to do it,
Or maybe she's just dumber than we think she is.
She gave us an alibi.
She said she was on the train from New York arriving at 7:30.
We're still confirming it.
But telling a lie that specific would be really dumb.
Were you in the room with her...
Okay, I'm gonna see Maura.
Oh, good.
I wanted to give you the autopsy results before I left.
Okay.
Overdose.
Well, there was a needle mark on the back of his neck,
which was the injection site for the same cancer drugs
that he was using on his patients.
His heart stopped within seconds of being injected.
Who would have access to those drugs?
I requested an inventory from the hospital,
But in the meantime, I'm running tests on another theory.
You're not gonna tell me the theory, are you?
No, not until the tests are complete.
Oh, Maura!
I've got to go. I'm having drinks with Samantha.
Samantha? The woman that thinks that ghosts murder people?
Well, she doesn't really think that.
I mean, she's just tracking an interesting story.
Okay, 'cause she doesn't seem very...
What?
Sane.
Well, if she's not crazy, she's up to something.
All right, well, I'll be careful.
I love it.
I sense a "but" coming.
No "but."
I have read published authors
whose first drafts aren't this polished.
Really?
Yes, really.
Have you ever thought about trying something longer?
A novel, perhaps?
I have.
I would love to put you in touch with my editors.
Dessert for my favorite medical examiner and her friend.
Double chocolate lava cake. And is that Vintage Port?
Well, if vintage means
sitting on the shelf for a really long time?
This is Angela, Detective Rizzoli's mother.
Samantha's in town for the writer's conference.
How do you do?
Pleasure to meet you.
I can see where the detective gets her beauty.
Oh, I like her.
Writer?
Yes. Yes.
Maura's a writer.
I write. There's a difference.
Hounds are calling.
Are you always this modest?
No.
But let's talk about you.
You know, I am amazed at the attention to detail in your stories.
How do you get your inspiration?
Research, research, research.
When I wrote "The Detective Doctor of Edinburgh,"
I moved to Edinburgh.
So that I could be completely immersed in his world.
I wanted to write about Joseph Bell,
so I learned everything I possibly could
about his father, et cetera.
Like hateful Hannah.
That ghost story isn't real.
Something happened, and people attached a ghost to it.
I might never know why, but, oh, well.
We can't always have the answers to our questions, can we?
I look forward to reading your first novel.
Thank you. Oh, keep the change.
This storm doesn't let up soon, I'm buying a bigger boat.
Oh, thank you.
Any luck running down the fired employees?
Uh, yeah. They all alibied up. Uh, what about the contractor?
Oh, he's not our killer.
Guy pays a 15% penalty for every day over the finish date,
Regardless of the reason.
Pretty steep.
And three accidents and two murders
won't help him keep his crew together either.
What about Samantha Caspary?
Conductor saw her on the train
the time of Jennie Tate's murder.
All right, I'll tell Maura.
Oh, no bother. I told her.
She asked me to do a more in-depth background check on her.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah, she said she wanted to address your concerns.
You can relax. Caspary's legit.
Okay. Frankie's got something.
Come on, Paddington. Let's go find him.
You looking for me?
Yeah. Take a look at this.
We searched through all the legal actions filed against
the Mallon Hospital in the last five years.
You find anything? - Oh, the usual patient complaints --
insurance coverages, food, rude nurses.
No one with an ax to grind. No credible threats.
So what am I supposed to be looking at?
This.
So I couldn't find anyone with a good reason
to hurt Jennie Tate or Dr. Morgan.
But we did find a lot of calls between the two of them
over the last couple of months.
Nothing unusual there. He was her doctor.
That's what we thought, too.
Then we noticed that her husband, Charles,
never called Dr. Morgan...
Until...
the night of his wife's murder.
Could be he was concerned about his wife.
Or maybe he just found out about this.
The state road motel?
This is the guest log from three months ago.
Dr. Morgan and Jennie Tate...
...stayed at the same hotel on the same night.
What are the odds of that?
Pretty damn good if they were having an affair.
Just a few things we need to clear up.
Okay.
When did you find out your wife was having an affair?
What? An -- an affair?
I don't hear you denying it.
What the hell are you talking about?
She -- she had cancer, for god's sake.
That's not the point.
That's enough.
Where were you the night your wife died?
At home until the detectives came
to tell me Jennie was dead.
Was there anyone there? Someone who can verify that?
No.
Did you go back to the hospital at any point?
No.
Why'd you call Dr. Morgan that night?
To check on Jennie.
Are you sure it wasn't to confront him
about screwing your wife?
You think my wife was having an affair with Dr. Morgan?
They spent the weekend together in New Hampshire.
It happens. The doctor/patient relationship --
It's a strong bond.
I knew about this. It's not what you think.
Tell me what I should think, Charles.
Local hospitals wouldn't approve the use of a new drug cocktail.
Too much liability, they said.
So Dr. Morgan treated Jennie at a private clinic
in new Hampshire.
Until...
Until Mallon Hospital agreed
to let him give the drugs to his patients.
You were right about one thing, detectives.
My wife did love Dr. Morgan.
So did I. He was saving her.
I have no idea why they were killed,
and it seems like you don't either, so...
Unless I'm under arrest...
We worked Charles Tate pretty hard,
a guy who just lost his wife.
I really hate that part of the job.
So his story checked out?
Yep. Back to square one.
All right, well,
the contractor had no motive.
None of the hospital employees held any grudges.
Charles Tate didn't do it.
Yeah, so it's...It's gotta be about the hospital.
Who would want to shut down a hospital?
Well, whoever it is may have enough of the cancer drugs
to kill at least three more people.
The drugs that killed Dr. Morgan were from Jennie's IV bag?
Yes, and by my calculations,
there's still 150ccs missing from the bag.
That's enough to kill three people?
Well, in a measured amount such as an IV drip,
it's completely safe, but in a concentrated dose,
it could result in immediate death.
I'll call the hospital and have them keep an eye
on Dr. Morgan's other patients.
So the rose, the impalement...
Somebody has to know the details of this ghost story.
Didn't Samantha Caspary mention something
about hospital archives?
I could send a C.S.R.U. team down there.
Okay.
If somebody did go through the files from the early 1900s,
there may be trace evidence.
You know, I might ask Samantha Caspary to join me.
Why?
Well, if there's no trace evidence,
it still might make sense to go through the documents.
And her PHD was in the evolution of baptism
in the English medieval church.
Which means that she's gone through thousands
of ancient records to build and test her theory.
Oh. So you're saying that she has good research skills
and she's not allergic to dust.
Exactly. And it wouldn't be the first time I've enlisted
an expert's opinion.
You okay with this?
Sure, as long as she signs a nondisclosure agreement.
Even if they find something, she won't be able to use it.
All right.
Done.
This part of the archive
contain medical records from before 1920.
If someone's been in here recently,
my team will know about it.
Thank you so much for including me.
We're finished in here. No fresh latents.
I doubt anyone's been near those shelves in 20 years.
Thank you. I'll see you back at the lab.
So... I suppose that's it.
Well, I've been thinking about what you said.
The story behind the story?
Exactly.
Maybe there is something to the Hannah Rose case
that relates to the present-day murders.
But there's no way to really know
unless we go through these files.
Are you serious?
I brought gloves.
Frankie?
What's going on?
I'm trying to avoid Kent.
Well, if you keep dripping on my bar,
you can avoid him outside.
Why are you avoiding him?
He wants me to go to a concert with him.
Nice. What concert?
That's just it. I don't know.
I don't want to spend an entire night
listening to bagpipes and harps.
Guy's weird.
Oh, come on. We're all a little weird.
Well, you don't know the half of it.
Well, I know he's the new kid in town.
He got here a year ago.
And probably doesn't have a lot of friends, Frankie.
That's on him.
You could be nice to him.
Yeah. That's what Nina said.
Good advice. You should listen to her.
You remember how I became den mother for the cub scouts?
Yeah. You loved it.
No, I did not love it.
I did that so that at least once a week
you would have some friends.
Get out. No way.
Frankie, you were a very shy boy.
You had a hard time making friends.
you needed a little help.
How is that helping?
All these years, I thought those guys were really my friends.
They became your friends once they got to know you.
You just needed a chance.
So you think I should tell Kent to join the cub scouts?
Kent gave you a generous offer.
Go. Enjoy it.
You wouldn't be saying that if you had to go.
I would, too.
Now you came here to eat or complain?
Tuna melt?
Yeah.
Fascinating.
When I was researching Dr. Bell,
I read a great deal about autopsies from this period.
But to actually hold an autopsy book...
You'd be surprised how little protocols have changed.
You know, I haven't found anything pertaining
to this murder/suicide case. Have you?
Imagine if the people who wrote these reports
knew that we'd be studying them over a hundred years later.
What would they make
of all the advances in medicine and treatments?
That's where the imagination of the novelist
can help fill in the gaps.
Do you ever think about how people of the future
will look at the work you do?
Samantha, what are you doing?
You were right to be suspicious about Samantha.
She said all those nice things about my writing
just so I'd trust her.
Oh, come on. That can't be true.
Oh. It's so obvious.
I caught her trying to remove files.
She just used me to get access to the archives.
What'd she try to take?
A list of the patients that died in 1905.
She wanted to research the families
and see if they knew anything about hateful Hannah.
I'll have Nina run the names on the list,
but that list is over a hundred years old.
I doubt it has anything to do with our case.
I just feel so foolish.
I... allowed the flattery to cloud my reason.
So you're human like the rest of us?
Well, the archives were illuminating, though.
Yeah?
According to the records,
Hannah Rose died of typhoid fever.
Her doctor was looking for a cure,
trying various treatments on several patients,
But none were successful and all the patients died.
What happened to the doctor?
Well, after his patients died, he committed suicide.
But there is no mention of a ghost or roses
anywhere in the archives.
Well, the administrator knew all about it.
I mean, she told us about a ghost story
that nearly destroyed the hospital.
Well, it was 1905.
People more readily accepted the supernatural.
And all those deaths all at once and a suicide,
it would be fertile ground for a ghost story.
I would think that a murderous ghost haunting a hospital
would be somewhat newsworthy.
I agree.
But Samantha said she couldn't find any accounts of the story.
And are we going to believe her on that one?
Well, if she had found something,
she wouldn't have come to us.
Well, somehow, the killer knows all about it
because they had to throw in the rose
to connect it to Hannah Rose.
Where would they find her name?
Not from the hospital archives.
Those records had been undisturbed for many years.
Well, with that many deaths and a suicide,
somebody had to have reported on it.
If we can't find the article,
then that means somebody stole it.
No, that's two z's. R-i-z-z-o-l-i.
I'm Frankie Rizzoli Junior.
My father is Frank Rizzoli Senior.
You know, this is, like,
the third time this has happened.
Can't you make a note on the file or something?
No, no, no, yeah. Whatever. I understand.
Thank you for your help.
Everything okay?
My father's having financial problems.
Somehow his creditors keep getting my number.
That's annoying.
Yeah.
It's always something with him, you know?
Maybe it's just a part of being a Rizzoli.
If I have a son,
he's probably gonna have to clean up my messes.
Don't do that.
What?
Don't put yourself down like that.
You're not like your father. You know that, right?
Yeah, I was just joking.
But I'm not. I knew him. And I know you.
And I know what you've grown into the past few years.
You're a good man and a fine detective.
Thank you.
So maybe it's time to just stop.
Stop what?
Stop being Frankie Junior. You're not a kid anymore.
Well, I've always been Frankie Junior.
Doesn't mean you always have to be...Frank.
Kent's looking for you again.
Well, he's a hard guy to avoid.
Then maybe you shouldn't avoid him.
I'll call him. I promise.
I bet you'll have a good time.
Sure.
And maybe after the concert,
you guys could sign up for cub scouts.
I'm gonna disown my mother.
That won't stop her from telling me
all the cute Frankie Junior stories.
Did you find anything
in the historical document room at the library, scout?
Actually, I did.
Turns out a lot of pages were cut out
of the original editions of "The Dispatch" from 1905.
These are the names of people who looked at newspapers
from the early 1900s over the last two months.
Any, uh, security cameras in that area of the library?
No. Apparently, they use all their money for white cotton gloves.
This is interesting.
Joseph Mason. Why is he so special?
He died two years ago,
but checked into the library last month.
There you are. I've been looking for you everywhere.
Oh! Wow, yeah.
I've been, uh... I was just about to call you.
I'd love to come. I would love to come, yeah.
What is it? Is it bagpipes or -- or the clear shark?
Clear...
Oh, you mean -- you mean clarsach? God, no.
You're not into harp music, are you?
No, no. I just thought that, you know, you...
Yes!
This is so cool.
Um, hey, hey, I, uh,
I gotta go canvass a building for witnesses.
You got time for a ride-along?
Really?
Yeah!
You sure?
Come on.
Oh, that'd be grand. I just need to get my bag from downstairs.
All right.
I've got an extra ticket for tonight
if you know anyone else who wants to come along.
Oh, I know just the person.
Any leads on who might be using the Mason library card?
Frankie talked to an old-timer who knew Mason.
Remembered him as being very frail,
but he had a caregiver who lived next door -- Margery Cannon.
Margery died six months ago of cancer,
and her husband died 20 years before that.
I'm getting really tired of all our leads being dead people.
All right.
There were no Margery Cannon admitted to the Mallon Hospital.
Maybe she was at a different hospital.
She died at St. Mary's.
"Survived by her devoted stepson, James Miller."
James Miller. James...
Can you pull the list of employees
at the Mallon Hospital, please?
Yeah. James Miller. Maintenance department.
A maintenance guy could move around the hospital
and never raise an eyebrow.
Yeah, let's go talk to him.
Also, uh, could you call the hospital, please,
and see if Margery Cannon was in Dr. Morgan's drug trials?
Yeah.
Thanks.
Ms. Najafi is unavailable, but she left this for you.
Margery's application to Dr. Morgan's program was denied.
Her form of cancer couldn't be treated with his drugs.
So James Miller came to work every day
and watched people in the program being cured
while his stepmom died.
So his revenge wasn't just against the hospital,
but also Dr. Morgan.
And Jennie Tate was just collateral damage.
Um, could we see James Miller's personnel file, please?
I'm sorry, detective,
but Ms. Najafi is the only person
who has access to those files. She's out.
Out where?
The construction foreman called,
said there was some kind of problem.
There's nobody on the site at this hour.
Thank you.
Stop! Aah!
No, please!
No, please.
James, no! Don't!
Don't do it.
Please help me.
Stay back.
It is not her fault that your stepmom is dead.
Yes, it is.
No, it's not. It's not anybody's fault.
They turned her away. They could've helped her.
It's all their fault.
The treatment wouldn't help her cancer.
You don't know that.
James, listen to me.
Margery would not have wanted this.
She helped people. She took care of people.
She would not want somebody else to die.
No! No! Aah!
I got her! I got her! Go!
She all right?
She's responding to the antitoxin.
Miller never had a chance to give her the whole syringe.
It's not a ghost.
Thanks.
Don't think about it.
Yeah.
Let's go.
Maura?
Hello.
I'm so glad you still came to the conference.
What I did was... unforgivable.
Well, I'm not going to lie.
For a person of your ability to do such a thing,
it was surprising and disappointing.
The blank page can make you a little crazy sometimes.
But I should not have violated your trust,
and for that, I am deeply ashamed.
Will you allow me to make it up to you?
May I introduce you to some people?
That's not necessary.
No, no. I-I want to.
I meant what I said. You're a wonderful writer.
And these people might be able to help you.
Please?
Okay.
Where's Detective Rizzoli?
I thought she was coming here with you tonight.
Yeah, she's just running a few minutes late.
She had to shoot someone.
I only shoot people in the line of duty.
Mostly.
Um, we're fine.
Samantha, in fact, has kindly offered to introduce us
to some of the wonderful writers here.
Wow. How kind.
Jane.
What?
Point taken.
Tess! Tess. Come and meet my friends.
This is Tess.
Hi. Jane Rizzoli.
Ah. She's a detective with the Boston Police Department.
Oh. And is that dress official police issue?
Uh, yes.
Actually, you should see when my brother wears it.
It's even more fabulous.
And this is Dr. Maura Isles.
She's the chief medical examiner.
It is a pleasure to meet you.
Oh, you two are gonna be the most popular people
in the room tonight.
You know, no one loves hearing about murder and mayhem
more than mystery writers.
Absolutely. Shall we?
Yes?
Yes.
Such a pleasure to meet you.
Well, I wanna...
Find me every seven minutes.
Ooh. This looks promising.
It's a one-week writer's retreat in the Adirondacks.
And all vegan, no TV, no internet.
No, thank you.
We should both do it.
Do you really hate me that much?
You should write a book, too.
Maura, that might be the worst idea you've ever had.
Why? You have so many great stories.
Great.
Then you tell them, and I'll wait for the books on tape.
Well, thanks for coming, anyway.
Yes, the refreshments were refreshing.
Frankie told me to meet him here after the concert.
Oh. Uh, well, they are not...
Oh, my God. ...- Here.
That was amazing!
I mean, the -- the pyro and the -- the makeup, right?
Oh, my God. We had so much fun.
Friends of yours?
Uh, yeah. We made lots of friends.
Where's Kent?
Ah! We're gonna rock this place all night!
Whoo, yeah! Drinks are on me, guys!
It's better than the kilt.
Guys, what a gig!
We were there, right up the front.
He was looking at me. Aah!
And I was like, "Aah!"
Right? - Right, and then --
It was so cool!
Whiskeys all around,
all around, everybody here.
Yes!
