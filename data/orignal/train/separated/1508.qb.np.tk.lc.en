okay . i &apos;m taking off .
where are you going ?
i thought we were going to give a chicken
the best day of its life .
i hate that we keep rescheduling that ,
but being a realtor man means working on sundays ,
like priests and lesley stahl .
good luck out there , honey .
we &apos;re all counting on you .
just got to make it through this commute .
i &apos;ll call when i get there .
i &apos;m there !
菲尔 · 邓菲
have a great day !
i am handling the sale of our neighbor jerry &apos;s house .
he &apos;s selling it and moving into a bachelor pad
now that he &apos;s officially divorced .
which is great !
well , i don &apos;t know about &quot; great . &quot;
i mean , you can come and go as you please , i suppose ,
and maybe see what &apos;s up with the u.p.s. girl
who &apos;s always asking if you work out , or --
it &apos;s great because we have the rare opportunity
to choose our new neighbors .
while still looking out
for my client &apos;s best interests , of course .
winkwink .
i &apos;m in kind of in a delicate spot --
stuck between my wife and the guy next door ,
but i &apos;m pretty sure i can satisfy them both simultaneously .
okay . that &apos;s them . that &apos;s them .
everybody look like you &apos;re gardening .
luke , grab that little hoe .
uh , i -- i don &apos;t think that &apos;s what she meant .
is it ?
okay , why are we doing this ?
this is their third visit , and we want to look good .
what &apos;s so great about them ?
they &apos;re very well @-@ liked in their neighborhood ,
they have very polite children ,
and they are sophisticated .
the husband is a huge wine collector .
oh , there it is .
all right , this is it . this is it .
okay , look sharp .
luke , what &apos;s on your face ?
i don &apos;t know . what color is it ?
why isn &apos;t it coming off ?
this feels like a panic move .
hey ... again . hello .
morning .
hello .
just doing a little family gardening .
see ya .
it &apos;s peanut butter , by the way .
we ran out of peanut butter two days ago .
holy cow . it works !
what is he doing ?
he &apos;s putting socks in a soda box and pulling them out .
oh , no .
this is like when my grandmother
started combing her hair with a cactus .
jay , jay , who is the president ?
i will be when they see this .
check this out .
what &apos;s my biggest problem in the bedroom ?
oh , thank god .
it &apos;s that i &apos;m always wearing the same socks
because they &apos;re always up front .
but this bad boy stores and rotates your socks .
it &apos;s gonna revolutionize the closet industry .
what an exciting time to be alive .
i &apos;m gonna get my lawyer on the horn ,
try to lock the name down .
check this --
&quot; sock it to me . &quot;
how about &quot; soxbox ? &quot;
gloria , please .
i &apos;m selling a lifestyle here .
uh , mom , we &apos;re gonna go head out by the pool .
no , no , no , wait . say hello .
jay , this is sophie .
hello .
hi , mr. pritchett .
what &apos;s that ? some sort of sock dispenser ?
bingo ! i &apos;m in the closet business .
and this is a crude prototype of my new invention .
what a great idea .
you rotate your socks
so you don &apos;t keep wearing the same ones .
that &apos;s exactly right .
i call it &quot; sock it to me . &quot;
that &apos;s so clever .
it &apos;s funny , and it tells you what it does .
imagine it in walnut .
what &apos;s happening ?
i -- i am so sorry that he &apos;s boring you .
no , i like this sort of stuff .
my grandpa earl &apos;s in the closet business , too .
wait , wait . earl ?
not -- not earl chambers .
yeah , he owns closets , closets , closets ...
closets . yeah .
i know your grandpa .
it was 1980 .
earl and i had just formed our company , closet @-@ fornia .
business was great , high @-@ end clients ,
maybe a celebrity or two .
i shouldn &apos;t name names . anyway ...
came to work one day ,
and earl &apos;s desk had been cleared out .
he had badmouthed me to half our rolodex .
it was devastating .
i had to start all over .
well , what the hell ?
it was larry hagman .
heck of a guy .
heart as big as his hat .
hey , you &apos;re back already ?
how was the birthday party ?
i rode a unicorn .
yes , you did .
all by your lonesome .
it wasn &apos;t a real unicorn .
thank you .
i &apos;m gonna go and do homework .
don &apos;t knock unless it &apos;s an actual emergency .
not a spider .
ms. plank gave her homework on the weekend ?
she &apos;s 7 .
i know . the woman is insane .
but listen .
i heard something in the glitter @-@ tattoo line .
what ?
there &apos;s an opening in miss sparrow &apos;s class .
oh , my god ! cam , that &apos;s amazing .
we got to get her in .
i know . we &apos;re going in first thing tomorrow .
let &apos;s see it .
two dolphins that form a heart .
there are two second @-@ grade teachers at lily &apos;s school --
miss sparrow ,
who makes learning fun and adventurous .
and then there &apos;s lily &apos;s teacher , mrs. plank ,
who is stressing lily out .
let &apos;s see , sweetie .
good job .
oh , no ! i spelled &quot; tadpole &quot; wrong !
oh , well , now , that &apos;s just one mistake .
mrs. plank doesn &apos;t tolerate mistakes !
okay .
all right .
i call mrs. plank &quot; mrs. crank . &quot;
because , you know ,
i have the courage to say what others won &apos;t .
behind her back .
and i also helped the previous owners
install a brand @-@ new tankless water heater a year ago ,
but did they show any gratitude ?
nope !
because it &apos;s a &quot; tankless &quot; job .
yes !
please move in .
we can riff like this all the time .
so , what do ya think ? do you still love it ?
absolutely .
i can just see filling this yard with flowers .
just like we &apos;re pretending to do .
by the way , i love those shoes .
oh , thanks .
george &apos;s firm does p.r. for about 10 shoe brands .
if we end up living here ,
trust me , you &apos;ll be swimming in shoes .
i &apos;ve had that dream .
speaking of dreams , what do you think ?
you guys ready to pull the trigger ?
i think we are .
that &apos;s great !
yes !
i &apos;m a size 6 !
not since i fell off the roof
while they were delivering our trampoline
have things come together so beautifully .
菲尔 · 邓菲
see you soon !
we did it .
we are gonna have the best neighbors ever !
what &apos;s that noise ?
cool !
i don &apos;t want to see a stupid house .
hey , how &apos; bout you shut up and not embarrass us ?
how &apos; bout you both shut up ?
i &apos;m sick of listening to you .
hey , don &apos;t talk to your dad like that ,
or you can go live with your boyfriend .
he &apos;s not my boyfriend .
i just make out with him
so i don &apos;t have to take his class again .
we should go say hi .
no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no .
phil , shut it down .
i &apos;m trying ! what are these things made of ?
come on .
dude ...
i love this place .
me too , baby .
i always wanted a spanish house .
it &apos;ll be like living at an el torito .
oh ! your family .
hey , you the neighbors ? you like living here ? !
what ? i &apos;m so sorry .
it &apos;s so hard to hear over all that freeway noise , right ?
hey , then no one &apos;s gonna complain
when i &apos;m revving my cars , my bike , or my lady .
i &apos;m ronnie lafontaine .
and this hot lady right here is my wife , amber .
and these two little hellraisers are tammy and ronnie jr .
hey , hot stuff .
m @-@ m @-@ m @-@ me ?
um ... hello .
damn , this neighborhood &apos;s sweet .
yeah , it &apos;s close to my work , too .
wh-- uh , what is your line of work , ronnie ?
well , i &apos;m basically a doctor .
oh , stop being modest .
he owns , like , a buttload of medical @-@ weed dispensaries .
ah , that &apos;s where i kno-- oh , hello ?
honey , you look a little nauseous .
yeah . yeah , a little .
hey , i got something for that .
all good .
how could you bring her to my home ?
she &apos;s the granddaughter of my worst enemy .
i had no idea who she was .
i met her in my theater group .
i &apos;m caesar , and she &apos;s concubine # 3 .
it was bound to happen .
earl chambers is a liar and a backstabber
who betrayed me and never apologized .
jay , please . it &apos;s just closets .
i wish it was just closets .
i respect those guys .
damn it , she saw the sock it to me !
so what ?
if she can remember how it works ,
she &apos;s gonna tell earl all about it .
if she can remember how it works ?
you put the sock in a box .
even joe could have thought of that .
what else did you discuss with her ?
did you mention
we &apos;ve been experimenting with lighted hanging rods ?
i don &apos;t have a great rap with girls ,
but it &apos;s better than that .
well , you &apos;re gonna use it with someone else
&apos;cause i forbid you to see her .
what ?
that &apos;s not fair .
what &apos;s not fair is me picking up the pieces of my life
while earl gets to be an extra on &quot; dallas &quot; !
hey , dunphy .
just checking out this tree .
oh , yeah ,
it &apos;s really messy , right ?
and it makes the house so dark .
but the -- the rats love it , so ...
yeah , no worries . i &apos;m gonna cut it down .
i don &apos;t want all this sap all over my lawn couch .
well , i wouldn &apos;t fire up your chainsaw just yet , ronnie .
it &apos;s a very competitive market .
is there another buyer ?
i really shouldn &apos;t say .
is this -- is this one of those realtor tricks ?
no .
where you &apos;re trying to get me to raise my offer ?
oh , no .
well , it &apos;s working .
all right . i &apos;ll throw in another 50 grand .
what ? ! that &apos;s a terrible idea !
i &apos;m not losing the house .
i had the best sex of my life in there .
when ? !
excuse me , ms. crank .
plank . ms. plank ?
yes ?
hi . i-- oh . a frowny @-@ face stamp .
i didn &apos;t know they made those .
i had to special order it from germany .
may i help you ?
uh , well , we &apos;re lily &apos;s parents .
is there a problem ?
not so much a problem , no .
no , more of an opportunity for you to ...
lighten your workload .
maybe turn that frowny @-@ face stamp upside down .
let me guess--
you &apos;ve heard there &apos;s
an opening in young ms. sparrow &apos;s classroom .
what ?
miss who ?
is this-- do you--
an opening ?
no .
oh , i &apos;m sorry .
forgive me for jumping to conclusions .
by all means , tell me why you &apos;re here .
well , we-- we &apos;ve just , uh , stopped by ,
uh , in the neighborhood to
say hello .
say hi . hi .
and , also , um ...
about this opening in miss sparrow &apos;s class
that you suggested for lily .
is that something that you would ...
that you would think would be a good idea ?
parents are not allowed
to choose their children &apos;s teachers .
no , and , of course ,
i would never suggest special treatment for lily
even if she is a -- a former orphan and minority
丑角
and-- and daughter of two gay men .
that &apos;s a big load on those little shoulders .
are you suggesting that your daughter is at a disadvantage
because she &apos;s being raised by gay parents ?
is it working ?
okay . you know what ?
look . uh , we just don &apos;t think that lily responds
to your , uh , teaching methods ,
and we think she would be happier in miss sparrow &apos;s class .
we would all be happier
in that new @-@ age drum circle she calls a classroom .
okay , well , we didn &apos;t mean to offend you .
we &apos;re not saying you &apos;re any worse than her .
she .
ma &apos;am ?
&quot; than she . &quot;
that &apos;s proper english .
it &apos;s too bad lily won &apos;t learn it .
so she can go .
as far as i &apos;m concerned , she &apos;s gone already .
one more child left behind .
okay , you know what ? no . lily will be fine ,
&apos;cause she &apos;s gonna have the chance to thrive
in a more supportive environment .
yeah , you don &apos;t need to worry about she .
this place is a great idea , gloria .
did i ever tell you
this is where i first tried pretzel bread ?
hello , jay .
hello , earl .
i invited him
so that you two finally can bury the machete .
well , this scumbag already buried it in my back .
you son of a bitch !
no ! no ! no ! no !
stop it ! sit down !
this is crazy .
you two need to be friends .
you &apos;re the only two people in the world
that care so much about closets .
this is silly !
i guess those angled shelves
that display all your precious shoes are silly .
or the rotating tie rack
that helps a brain surgeon save valuable seconds ,
and , just maybe , a life .
you fought me every step of the way on that .
because the technology wasn &apos;t there yet .
people were gonna get hurt !
if you would open your ears -- - enough !
you two are acting like two little boys .
so i &apos;m gonna have to handle this
how my mother handled my two brothers .
it &apos;s either you two work this out ...
... or you kill each other .
when reefer madness raised his offer ,
we invited the thompsons over
to try to convince them to raise theirs .
we wanted to show them
that the best thing about that house
is its location .
it &apos;s dunphy @-@ adjacent .
that was so much fun .
we &apos;ll hear from you soon , huh ?
you sure will .
sooner than you think .
all right .
okay , bye .
drive safe .
see ya .
nailed it .
are they gone ?
they are , but don &apos;t you worry .
we are gonna see a lot more of those two soon .
oh , and hearing from them even sooner .
it looks like someone didn &apos;t get their &quot; phil &quot; of dunphy .
no .
what ?
they pulled their offer .
why ? what happened ?
you pervs probably freaked &apos; em out .
what do you mean , &quot; pervs &quot; ?
it &apos;s short for perverts .
you guys were throwing yourselves at them all night long .
what can i say ? that &apos;s shoe business .
whoa , no guns allowed in this house .
let &apos;s off that top , lisa .
let &apos;s ... let &apos;s top that off , lisa .
phil .
so , this has been fun .
it &apos;ll be even more fun when you guys move in .
well , even if we raise our offer ,
who knows if we &apos;ll get the house ?
fortunately ,
you are getting into bed with the right people .
nothing inappropriate , of course .
wink , wink .
but just so there &apos;s no misunderstanding ,
we want you .
why didn &apos;t you stop us ?
hey , i don &apos;t know what you guys are into .
oh , my god . what are we gonna do ?
oh , relax .
i &apos;m sure you guys will find a couple
that wants to get with you .
i &apos;m here because she says you want to apologize .
you &apos;re the one that owes the apology to me .
oh , yeah ?
closetcon , 1998 .
you sabotaged my booth .
that thing collapsed because it was cheap
and bought in the orient -- like your wife .
how many times do i have to tell people --
you only pay for the meeting .
the feelings have to be real !
just keep your granddaughter out of my house .
for all i know , you sent her over there to spy on me !
sophie ? what is she doing at your house ?
dating my kid .
mitchell ? he &apos;s got to be 40 years old .
and don &apos;t you know that -- oh , i get to do this .
mitchell is gay .
shut up .
my stepson , manny .
she &apos;s dating one of you ?
my little , sweet sophie ?
that &apos;s right .
my boy &apos;s dating her .
he &apos;s dating her real good .
well , i &apos;m gonna put an end to it .
great idea , earl .
&apos;cause girls love take advice
from their grandfathers about boys .
i banged your ex @-@ wife !
if you banged dede , i do owe you an apology .
lily , it &apos;s daddies . can we talk to you ?
all right . where &apos;s the spider ?
no , no , no , it &apos;s -- it &apos;s not that .
now , listen , we have some good news .
we -- we know you &apos;ve been stressed out at school ,
so daddy and i went down there today ,
and we got you into ...
miss sparrow &apos;s class !
really ?
i thought you were setting me up .
but i want to stay with mrs. plank .
but why ? miss -- miss sparrow &apos;s so fun and creative .
yeah , today , she gave us yarn ,
and we did whatever we wanted .
i don &apos;t want to play with yarn .
i want to read and learn math .
we do math .
really ? what &apos;s 2 plus 7 ?
27 .
no . no , it &apos;s 9 .
but that &apos;s an honest mistake , sweetheart .
okay , what does blue and yellow make ?
blellow .
you need to fix this .
i could not sleep all night
thinking about those obnoxious people
living next door to us .
especially that boy with the ripped jeans and the long hair
and those blue eyes who called me hot .
me ? hot ? what ?
phil , you know a bad neighbor can ruin your whole life .
you remember my friend juliet from yoga class ?
we went to her brother &apos;s restaurant .
adult braces .
nope .
black .
juliet . how is she ?
miserable .
these awful people moved in next door to her ,
and she feels like she &apos;s trapped in her house .
she has to run to her car every morning .
that explains those calves .
phil .
what am i supposed to do ?
i have one offer , and it &apos;s way above asking .
well , i don &apos;t know .
maybe , isn &apos;t it possible
that jerry never even sees this offer ?
things do go missing all the time .
i &apos;m legally bound to present all offers .
wink , wink .
stop doing that .
withholding information would be a violation
of the realtor &apos;s oath .
which you wrote .
well , i also wrote my own wedding vows .
i guess i should break those , too ?
phil .
what am i saying ?
i &apos;ll never send you to bed without a hug .
manny up yet ?
he &apos;s getting dressed . why ?
he was asleep when i got home last night .
and i want to talk to him about the sophie @-@ earl situation .
are you going to start again ?
i am tired of hearing you rant
about the crazy closet world .
why would i rant about crazy closet world ?
those lunatics priced themselves out of business years ago .
manny ? !
two minutes ! i &apos;m fixing my costume !
if he wants to date this girl ,
it &apos;s none of your business .
that &apos;s exactly what i was gonna tell him .
where &apos;s jay ?
what the hell are you doing here ?
this thing between us is getting out of control .
we got to put an end to it right now .
as long as you own up to what you did 30 years ago .
if apologizing
is gonna keep your no @-@ good son away from my sophie , then --
he &apos;s not a no @-@ good !
yes , he is . he &apos;s a walking hormone .
now , let &apos;s hear this apology .
fine .
i was under a lot of pressure back then , and -
okay , keep in mind i &apos;m not in makeup yet ,
but do these sandals make my legs look thick ?
&apos;cause i -- i could lower the hem .
aw , geez .
who &apos;s that ?
that &apos;s , uh , the maid &apos;s son .
not now , gomez !
jay , what are you doing ? !
letting the man speak !
i &apos;m sorry , i didn &apos;t know we had any company .
hi . i &apos;m manny .
you &apos;re manny ?
you said you were under pressure ...
this is the big stud
who &apos;s been groping my sophie ?
sir , i promise you
there &apos;s nothing untoward between me and sophie .
you know what , kid ?
i believe you .
and you should .
he &apos;s the sweetest boy in the whole world !
no , he &apos;s not !
pritchett , i wish i had a number @-@ 10 mirror
so you could see the look on your face right now .
hey , this is nice .
i think i am gonna call it the &quot; sock &apos; n &apos; roll . &quot;
the hell you are .
damn ! that &apos;s a good name .
hey , phil . come on in .
hey , jerry .
well , look at this bachelor pad .
yeah .
and what a fun neighborhood you live in .
h @-@ hey , you locked up your car , right ?
i definitely did , yeah .
good .
hey , you want some tea ?
this is my only pot ,
so it might be a little macaroni @-@ and @-@ cheesy .
i &apos;m good . i &apos;m cutting carbs .
so , did you , uh , get a chance to look over that offer ?
yeah , it &apos;s great .
i can finally move into a better place ,
maybe get that colonoscopy
my doctor &apos;s been pushing for .
what if i told you
there &apos;s an even better offer coming ?
there is ?
there sure might be !
tomorrow , someone could show up and offer way more .
but , phil , this is above asking .
why don &apos;t you want me to take it ?
oh , just a bad feeling .
are you not telling me something ?
nope , that &apos;s just the f-- the bad feeling .
good , because you &apos;re the only one
i can trust these days .
damn it !
these new buyers just seem like terrible people .
i know it &apos;s selfish , but we just --
we don &apos;t want them living next door to us .
no , i get it .
the guys on the other side of this wall ,
they like to get drunk and play with their nail gun .
oh , that &apos;s ... crazy .
listen , phil .
you &apos;ve always been a great neighbor and a good friend .
i think i can hold out a little longer on the offer .
are you sure ?
yeah .
i think of this old pickle jar as being half full .
hot !
i can &apos;t have anything nice .
not the wall !
on my honor , i promise to
aid in man &apos;s quest for shelter ,
to recognize i &apos;m not just in the business of houses --
i &apos;m in the business of dreams in the shape of houses .
hey ! careful with that !
it &apos;s art .
i can &apos;t believe this is happening .
who knows ?
maybe we &apos;ll end up loving &apos; em .
yeah . maybe .
to disclose all illegal additions ,
shoddy construction , murders , and ghosts ...
are we wrong
or is there some tension between the four of us ?
uh , maybe a little .
maybe a little .
i told ya .
yeah .
all right . well ...
we &apos;re up for it whenever you are .
wink , wink .
... and to put my clients &apos; needs before my own .
and mine .
someone needs her bedtime hug early .
yep . come here .
hi , ms. plank .
hey , ms. plank .
well , well , well , if it isn &apos;t mary ann and ginger .
that &apos;s hilarious .
玛丽安可爱亲切 小姜性感迷人
okay . &apos; cause --
yeah . oh .
oh , that &apos;s funny .
and while
while we &apos;re laughing about things ,
uh , this is funny , too .
it seems that we forgot to talk to lily
before coming in to see you .
and -- and she made it very clear in no uncertain terms
that she loves you ,
and she wants to stay in your class .
how -- how great is that ?
i will take lily back ...
... if you are able to tell me
the object of this sentence --
oh , gosh .
&quot; lily &apos;s parents were wrong about mrs. plank . &quot;
do you know it ?
i -- i -- i think that the object is to humiliate us ?
correct . see ?
