well , here it is . my last tip .
only $ 2 .
and to think , i held in a fart for those cheap bastards .
this night sucks .
we don &apos;t even have enough to buy supplies for tomorrow .
we &apos;ll just have to go to that store where everything &apos;s free .
oh , good . they &apos;re open .
and we have to sneak all this stuff out .
han &apos;s staying late to do inventory .
damn it , why does he always have to be so asian ?
let &apos;s see , what do we need for our cupcake shop ?
eggs , sugar .
a stripper pole ?
do you want to make money or not ?
how are we gonna hide these eggs ?
you could put some of those &quot; grade a large &quot;
where there &apos;s &quot; grade a itty @-@ bitties . &quot;
rude , but i don &apos;t hate it .
i can probably fit four to six in each .
so positive !
i love that you &apos;re a &quot; cup &apos;s half full &quot; kind of person .
so come here often ?
this is my first time .
well , you &apos;re very pretty .
oh , thank you .
heads up . han &apos;s coming your way .
should i fake a stroke ?
and p.s. , if i don &apos;t get up in three minutes ,
it &apos;s a real one .
no , i &apos;ll deal with him .
you keep going .
keep it up , and we &apos;ll finally have an answer
to the question &quot; what comes first ?
the chicken or the oleg ? &quot;
here you go .
i just found the greatest thing online .
the ultrasound of the kim and kanye baby
where someone photoshopped a &quot; 666 &quot;
on its little baby butt ?
wait , this kid &apos;s half kardashian .
its big baby butt .
wow , that baby &apos;s already famous for doing nothing ...
just like its mom .
no , what i found is a site where we can apply
for a small business grant .
there &apos;s a couple of categories : women @-@ owned business--
no thanks . i &apos;ve been to jail .
i was already owned by a woman .
there &apos;s also a minority @-@ owned category .
you don &apos;t know who your father is ,
and you do have an exotic look .
any chance he could be native american ?
yes , in fact , i think his name was
chief running away .
wait .
maybe we don &apos;t even need your father .
we are white ,
which according to the last presidential election ,
is the new minority .
so now all we need is a letter of recommendation
from someone who owns another start @-@ up business .
i was thinking of a recommendation
from candy andy &apos;s sweets and treats .
i &apos;ve already written it , so he just has to sign it .
will you ask andy ? i can &apos;t , he &apos;s my ex .
and i &apos;m saving up my favor
for a booty call on a cold night .
i hate asking men for things .
favors , last names , to stop .
excuse me , could i get some more sweet &apos;n low ?
why don &apos;t you look in your purse ?
it &apos;s where i saw you put them .
i &apos;m so embarrassed .
don &apos;t be .
i wasn &apos;t when i stole them last night .
what did andy say ?
he &apos;s gone .
for lunch ?
forever .
the man is gone .
his store is empty .
oh , my god , this is so sad .
i know . there goes the candy .
and my booty call .
he didn &apos;t even leave a note ?
or a razzle ?
forget the candy .
are we not gonna talk about the fact
that my ex @-@ boyfriend left without so much as a peep ?
great . now i want peeps .
hey , max .
is today the day we &apos;re gonna get married ?
sure , amir .
&apos;cause my dream in life is to be detained
for four hours on our honeymoon flight .
max , you do know i was born in this country , right ?
you were born here ? how old are you ?
about zero dark thirty ?
yeah , you were born in a walmart , right ?
where do you think the expression
&quot; clean up on aisle 12 &quot; comes from ?
hey , caroline ,
you bummed you drove your boyfriend out of town ?
for the record , i did not chase andy away .
we ended our relationship well .
right , that &apos;s why i helped him move out
in the middle of the night .
man , you messed that up .
so self @-@ involved .
coming in a little hot , amir .
yeah , guns ablazin &apos; . if i was allowed to carry them .
oh , amir . you &apos;re the bomb .
look at us .
we &apos;re like homeland , if it was a rom @-@ com .
you don &apos;t have to read it , han .
it &apos;s just a standard letter of recommendation .
don &apos;t be a bitch . just sign it .
i &apos;m not comfortable putting my name
on a document i haven &apos;t read .
i understand , but don &apos;t be a bitch .
just sign it .
&quot; max &apos;s homemade cupcakes is
an up @-@ and @-@ coming powerhouse business . &quot;
i can &apos;t sign this .
this has more lies than my okcupid profile .
don &apos;t be a bitch . just sign it .
that one &apos;s on me , girls .
if i sign this , it &apos;s lying .
i could get deported .
and i &apos;m one home inspection away from a poodle adoption .
a poodle ? that &apos;s cool .
you can share sweaters .
hurry up , bitch .
the deadline to mail that is tonight .
well , if you just wanted to steamroll someone ,
why didn &apos;t you get your boyfriend , andy , to sign it ?
they split .
he left last night without a peep .
damn it , now i &apos;m thinking about those peeps again .
oh , i was worried you two wouldn &apos;t make it .
you always have your mind on business ,
and andy was such an easy spirit .
i think you mean &quot; free spirit . &quot;
easy spirit is a shoe worn by people
whose spirits have died .
i have two pairs .
okay , fine . give it back .
i &apos;ll find someone else with a business .
what about sophie ? she owns a small business ,
and she loves to give ,
not as much as she loves to receive .
i &apos;m not so sure sophie &apos;s cleaning business
is totally , well , legal .
i mean , when we worked for her ,
on the memo line of our paycheck ,
she wrote &quot; colonoscopy . &quot;
and for the record , sophie &apos;s cleaning business
is totally legit .
her organ @-@ trading might not be .
forget it , caroline .
we might deport you ourselves .
all we need is a fedex box .
um , caroline . come over here .
i think i can help you with that .
thanks , earl , but you don &apos;t have a small business .
the size of my business has never been in question .
and i may not have a business ,
but ...
han lee does .
max , look . earl forged han &apos;s signature .
that &apos;s what his signature looks like .
when i forge it , i just draw a picture of hello kitty .
you want to know your future ?
no , no thanks .
you sure ?
i have a message about your love life .
$ 10 .
are you asleep ?
max ? max , i really need to talk .
oh , just come in and get it over with .
everybody else does .
max , i &apos;m sorry , but i really need to talk .
i went to the fortune teller near the diner ,
and she told me that i &apos;d never find love in my life .
fortune @-@ telling &apos;s a scam .
&quot; you &apos;ll never find a man , your moon &apos;s in uranus ,
no man will ever be in uranus . &quot;
i could &apos;ve told you that the second day i met you .
please , max , just listen for five minutes .
come over here . i &apos;ll make you some tea .
tea ? who am i , pippa middleton ?
toast me an eggo waffle and maybe i &apos;m listening .
well , we were saving that waffle
for a special occasion , but okay .
chestnut , we &apos;re eating your birthday waffle now .
i don &apos;t know why i &apos;m pissing him off .
he &apos;s gonna be the only man in my life .
i can &apos;t believe you blew $ 10 on a psychic .
why didn &apos;t you just buy a skinnygirl margarita
like all the other lonely white chicks ?
i spent $ 50 .
i bought a crystal that protects me from bad juju .
hey ! there &apos;s no reason to get anti @-@ semitic .
you spent money on crystal you can &apos;t snort ?
what is wrong with you ?
i freaked out . i didn &apos;t want it to be true .
is it true , max ?
am i never gonna find love ?
was andy my one chance ?
did i screw it up because i wanted success ?
was everyone right ?
that is a lot of questions for one waffle .
and where is that waffle ?
you &apos;re a bad waitress at home too .
who could that be ?
i don &apos;t know . let me consult the spirits .
who is it ?
it &apos;s sophie .
yeah , it &apos;s me ,
the shady lady with the illegal business .
yeah , and caroline , you owe me an apology
or i will take out these hoops ,
and we will get into it , girl .
yeah , and i warn you ,
i did some extreme fighting in warsaw .
extreme fighting ? that &apos;s awesome .
yeah , they would throw a big hunk of cheese in a trough
and let all the village girls just go at it .
sorry , sophie .
it just seemed like a better business decision
to go with the forgery .
what is that ?
is that a waffle ?
okay ! you are forgiven .
damn it . i didn &apos;t even get a bite .
i &apos;m awake and sober for nothing .
sophie , do you believe in psychics ?
oh , no . that &apos;s all fake .
you know , i knew a family of gypsy psychics
who couldn &apos;t even predict
that they would all die in a barn fire .
hey , girls . sorry to interrupt ,
but sophie promised to rub antifungal cream
on my thick , yellow toenails .
oleg , come over here .
i &apos;ll do it in between bites .
this is what you &apos;re afraid you &apos;re missing ?
because this is a relationship .
seriously , max .
that &apos;s something i really want .
and now i &apos;m never gonna have it .
get in there , baby . i have two feet .
interesting .
she &apos;s a psychic , but she needs a bell
to tell her someone &apos;s here .
max , please don &apos;t make me do this .
i don &apos;t want to hear any more bad things .
nothing bad &apos;s gonna happen .
she &apos;s gonna tell you
you have a bright , love @-@ filled future
or i &apos;m gonna kick her in the crystal balls .
hello , girls .
i &apos;ll tell you your future as soon as i finish eating .
it &apos;ll only take a minute .
since i quit smoking , i eat like a prisoner .
come , sit , ruminate on your wishes and dreams .
well , my wish is that you give my friend her money back ,
and my dream is that
i &apos;m a backup dancer for missy elliott .
great . a wise @-@ ass .
do you want to know your future or not ?
um , you already told me my future .
that &apos;s why we &apos;re here .
you said i &apos;d never find love .
when did i say that ?
and you , tough guy , don &apos;t say ,
&quot; well , you &apos;re the psychic . &quot;
maybe she is a psychic , because i am a tough guy
and i was gonna say that .
you know , it &apos;s hard to remember .
i see a lot of sad , single girls .
but looking at you right now ,
it makes sense .
and here .
take your phony crystal back .
and i &apos;m not so sure this is a real crystal .
it looks like one of those vegan deodorant things .
and we want our money .
oh , okay . what just happened ?
i put a curse on you .
max , you said nothing bad was gonna happen !
well , i &apos;m not a psychic , and neither is she .
laugh , buster .
nothing in life will go your way ,
and you will live under a dark cloud .
will this dark cloud merge
with the current dark cloud above me
or fly alongside of it ?
look , we don &apos;t want to trouble you ,
but if you could remove the curse
and possibly that noodle on your blouse ...
oh , no . did you just--
cursed you too .
tell you what .
i &apos;ll lift both curses for 50,
or else your whole life
will come crashing down all around you .
the only way i &apos;m giving a strange woman 50 bucks
is if i &apos;m walking out of here with a genital piercing .
i do that as well .
don &apos;t believe in curses , never have .
not since jennifer martin told me
i was going to hell for sleeping with her boyfriend .
but i didn &apos;t .
i just ended up going to homecoming with him .
max , we have to go back and pay her .
our lives are hard enough .
we don &apos;t need things to come crashing down around us .
relax . nothing &apos;s coming crashing down around us .
don &apos;t jump , paul !
paul , don &apos;t jump !
paul ? who &apos;s paul ?
and what is he doing on the roof ?
okay .
that was paul &apos;s life that came crashing down ,
not ours .
max , i think we all know that
i &apos;m a highly educated woman
who doesn &apos;t really believe in curses ,
but i am putting every penny we make tonight
in the &quot; lift the curse &quot; fund .
and i &apos;m gonna tell you one more time ,
we &apos;re not spending another 50 bucks
on some stupid curse .
a body fell from the sky !
paul got a bad batch of shrooms .
it had nothing to do with the curse .
everyone knows you don &apos;t take psychedelics
above the second floor .
poor amateur bastard .
and we need our money for essentials , like food
and the penguin statue i saw at the dollar store .
the one that says &quot; chill out . &quot;
so chill out .
caroline , i feel bad about
not signing your letter of recommendation .
so i wrote one myself and signed it .
here .
that &apos;s so nice of you .
&quot; the extremely hardworking caroline channing ,
who has devoted her life to business
and nothing and no one else . &quot;
han , this is supposed to be about getting a loan ,
not being alone .
i totally get it , girl .
i &apos;m alone as well .
we have our eyes on the prize ,
so our beds are empty .
but occasionally , i pay for it .
did han just intimate
that he occasionally gets a hooker ?
lucky bastard .
he probably gets a child &apos;s discount .
max , look . the future &apos;s already happening .
even in han &apos;s letter , i &apos;m alone .
the only chance for a love life i have now
is going halfsies on a hooker with han .
we have to reverse the curse now .
news flash : everybody is cursed .
you lost your money last year .
literally nothing good has ever happened to me .
han hasn &apos;t grown since the fourth grade .
oleg &apos;s toenails look like fritos .
and earl was born black
at the eighth or ninth @-@ worst time
to be a black man in america .
look around , it &apos;s the valley of the damned .
name one person who isn &apos;t cursed .
hey , guys !
i just found a $ 100 bill on the sidewalk !
drinks for everyone !
max , pop open the fancy brandy .
&quot; fancy brandy &quot; is gonna be my stripper name
if you ever let me put in that pole .
sophie , guess what ?
we went back to that psychic to complain ,
and she put a curse on us .
oh . you &apos;re cursed ?
but it &apos;s stupid , like you said , right ?
yeah , yeah . that &apos;s stupid .
yeah .
did she mention me ?
no .
she just cursed us and said
our whole lives would come crashing down around us .
and 30 , 40 , 50 .
the curse is lifted .
oh , i don &apos;t think you got me . what about my curse ?
talk about phoning it in .
couldn &apos;t you wave a feather or spin your head
or throw up or something ?
that &apos;s extra .
you know what ? i &apos;m in a good mood tonight .
i got through the whole day on 15 cigarettes
and one sheet cake .
i &apos;m gonna give tough guy a free reading here .
oh , free , as in the $ 50 you just shook us down for ?
should never have quit . okay .
future coming right at you .
i see that you will have a happy life .
me , happy ?
all right , get your hat , mother . we &apos;re leaving .
and i see a large sum of money coming your way .
over $ 10,000 .
max , it &apos;s the grant .
we applied for $ 12,000 . is that it ?
sure .
and in spite of your bad childhood ...
she knew you had a bad childhood .
come on , every childhood is bad .
you &apos;re stupid . you can &apos;t reach stuff .
it &apos;s rough .
in spite of it ,
i see great love and children in your future .
max .
me ? no , wait .
you must be picking up on her vibes .
check again .
no , great love and children
will be part of your future .
she will die alone .
okay , well , that &apos;s all i can take .
i &apos;m not gonna sit here and wait for the other paul to fall .
let &apos;s go , max .
no , no , no , no .
no , no . wait .
she obviously got it wrong . didn &apos;t you ?
nope . still dying alone ...
with nothing but her great success .
i &apos;m sorry , i &apos;m sorry . what ?
i see great success in your future .
you do ? oh , thank god .
i &apos;m gonna have success ? how big a success ?
oh , honey , it &apos;s so big ,
you won &apos;t even know you &apos;re alone .
all right , go .
may you live a long and healthy life .
and put on your hat and gloves .
i &apos;m predicting snow .
it &apos;s not going to snow .
at most , it &apos;s gonna rain 30 @-@ year @-@ old dudes .
maybe she isn &apos;t so psychic .
stop fighting it , max .
you &apos;re gonna find love and be happy ,
and i &apos;m gonna be successful .
you hear that , new york ?
i &apos;m gonna be successful and alone !
and robbed and raped if you keep calling that out .
and it all started when i dropped
that grant application into that mailbox
that those guys are unbolting and taking away .
what &apos;s going on ?
it &apos;s called emails .
we &apos;re getting rid of this . no one mails anything anymore .
yes , they do . i did yesterday .
and our $ 12,000 depends on it .
sorry , doll .
this box has been out of commission for a week .
according to a psychic , her box is gonna be
out of commission forever .
we had to tell him .
you expect me to lie to a city employee ?
so i guess we &apos;re not getting that grant .
the psychic was wrong .
maybe nothing she said is gonna come true .
i told you , it &apos;s a scam .
max , look .
it &apos;s snowing .
and she predicted snow .
oh , crap ! am i gonna have kids ?
so she was right on snow , but not on the money .
so what is it ?
am i or am i not gonna die old and alone ?
why are we even talking about this ?
we &apos;re probably not gonna make it through the winter .
if you die first ,
i am totally eating you .
oh . i know .
and besides ,
no one person can get it all .
you &apos;re right .
no one person can , but what about two ?
you &apos;ll have the love and the kids
and i &apos;ll have success .
maybe we can share , like we share our tips
or that wheat thin we found in your pillowcase .
are you asking to bang my great love ?
which is fine with me , becaue i &apos;m already bored
and sleeping with his poker buddy .
in fact , let &apos;s switch .
you can have my great love , and i &apos;ll die alone .
max , you don &apos;t want to die alone .
i am dying to die alone .
