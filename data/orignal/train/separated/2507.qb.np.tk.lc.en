第二十三季 第十四集
史上最无意义的里程碑
昨天的食物 明天的价格
why , you little ... !
good evening . it is with great sadness i inform you
that america and china have declared war ,
and a massive nuclear attack is expected
to reach our shores within the hour .
that &apos;s the sort of hypothetical emergency .
today &apos;s disaster preparedness drill is designed
to get us ready for .
all springfielders should now move off the streets
and inside their homes .
please avoid the superstitious panic
which marked the recent lunar eclipse .
sorry , dad . i was afraid the dragon
wouldn &apos;t cough the moon back up .
you idjit ! the dragon always coughs the moon back up !
i know it &apos;s futile ,
but i must again point out there is no dragon .
then why am i paying $ 800 a year
in dragon insurance ?
again , i maintain that money would be
better spent on car insurance .
lisa , everyone knows dragons do not attack cars .
geez , pick up a book .
i pick up books like you pick up beers !
then you have a serious reading problem .
now remember , this is only a drill .
ah ! the missiles really are coming !
the so @-@ called drill is just a way to get you into shelters
without causing total chaos !
is what i would say , if this weren &apos;t a drill .
this is not a drill !
now we &apos;re supposed to stay down
in our storm cellar for three hours .
so do your farting now .
homie , what if that was the last thing you ever said ?
don &apos;t worry . my last words will be
&quot; i can outrun that lion . &quot;
all right , everybody in .
all right , who &apos;s the wisenheimer
that &apos;s been eating the powdered food ?
not me .
two can play at that game .
i can do this ! i can do this !
boy , i told you an hour ago ,
stop that !
but bunkerball is keeping us sane !
do we really have to sit here the whole time ?
i mean , if we went out now ,
it might be cool to see the town empty .
yeah , i could sneak into the school and write whatever
i want on the chalkboard !
i could see a planetarium show
without the secondhand marijuana !
and i can drive drunk while i &apos;m actually sober !
it &apos;s fun , but not as fun .
that &apos;s odd .
why are all those cars parked at city hall ?
ay caramba !
if i didn &apos;t know better ,
i &apos;d say it &apos;s a town meeting .
not without us , it isn &apos;t . pull over .
餐饮服务
welcome to this secret meeting ,
made possible by the fake disaster drill .
and a special thanks for the hard work
of the mystery and secrecy committee .
we have names , you know .
quit complaining ! you only meet once a month !
yes , but the meetings last eight hours !
shut up ! shut up !
this is the most fun i have !
and now for the reason we are here .
what &apos;s going on ?
why is there a picture of us ?
this isn &apos;t good .
oh , honey , why must you always assume
that a huge picture of us
at a secret meeting we weren &apos;t told about is a bad thing ?
the results are in : this town has voted unanimously
to get rid of springfield &apos;s unending nightmare :
the simpsons .
they &apos;re here ! the monsters are here !
moe , it &apos;s me , marge .
i &apos;m your friend .
the monster queen is coming on to me !
why would you want to banish us from springfield ?
yeah .
we &apos;re like family to you .
i &apos;m talking to you , headphone @-@ bus @-@ driver guy .
i &apos;ll have you know i &apos;m also a hair donor !
salma hayek wore me to the oscars !
this is not about who wore whose hair where .
we are here to banish the simpsons ,
although we are not pleased to be doing so .
i am !
me , too .
i feel like a kid at christmas !
i believe you know my position .
i know we &apos;re all happy .
i &apos;m just trying to spare their feelings .
those freaks have no feelings !
even baby never cry !
she &apos;s a freak !
what baby does that ? !
why would an entire town go to all this fuss
to get rid of one family ?
what have we done that &apos;s so terrible ?
i &apos;m glad you asked .
the simple fact is the city is going broke
cleaning up after homer &apos;s drunken shenanigans ...
we won ! whoo @-@ hoo !
homer , that is not banishment @-@ hearing behavior !
... bart &apos;s pranks , which dwindle in humor
as they rise in destruction ...
... and lisa &apos;s environmental initiatives ...
if i may speak .
we &apos;re not monsters .
we &apos;re just people .
people who love each other and love this town ,
the only place we &apos;ve ever called home .
thank you .
marge , you are a sweet woman
and you make us see your family in a more forgiving light .
thank you .
which is why you &apos;re the worst simpson of all !
huh ? !
yeah , yeah !
now , now , now just a second here .
now , i know we &apos;re not perfect .
but , uh , i believe it was sammy hagar who said ...
silence !
d &apos;oh !
that was an &quot; inside me &quot; bone !
make way for captain coolerhead !
now , i like a good old @-@ fashioned witch trial
as much as the next person ,
but i do not think we should be so quick
to judge our long @-@ time neighbors .
not so fast , flanders .
we knew you &apos;d be the voice of mercy ,
and we &apos;re prepared to answer your concerns .
any other objections ?
i withdraw my ... diddily .
oh ... i always thought &quot; tarred and feathered &quot;
由乐观者俱乐部赞助
was just a figure of speech .
good luck patching potholes and stuffing pillows now !
simpson , in accordance with article six ,
section two of the town charter ...
wait ! if you banish us ,
you shall be cursed with a thousand @-@ year drought .
i mean , a thousand @-@ year flood !
d &apos;oh ! i mean , a thousand years of perfect weather .
just get out .
* i &apos;m a rolling stone *
* all alone and lost *
* for a life of sin *
* i have paid the cost ... *
oh , that was the last springfield radio station .
now we just get shelbyville talk radio .
if you see a simpson ,
do not try to reason with it .
just kill it and turn in the pelt for a free soda .
soda , eh ?
dad , where are we going ?
do we have a plan ?
oh , let &apos;s face it .
i &apos;m the one that &apos;s brought this fate upon us .
and there &apos;s only one way out--
i &apos;ve gotta man up .
okay , manning up ...
manning up .
manning ...
oh , girling down !
girling down !
hey , henrietta hippo , i &apos;ve got to drain the inchworm .
fine .
please , put that down .
i just got started .
not you . him !
you best get back where you belong .
please , sir , we &apos;ve been thrown out of a place
we &apos;ve always called home .
we just want to live out our lives in peace .
rejected by society , huh ?
well , why didn &apos;t you say so ?
welcome to the off @-@ the @-@ grid unincorporated settlement
we proudly call &quot; the outlands . &quot;
we &apos;ve found a new home .
when god shuts a door , he opens a window .
oh , i wouldn &apos;t be openin &apos; no windows .
coyotes will take your baby .
人口 : 与你无关
eh , i &apos;m sick of watching fox .
let &apos;s get some fresh air .
i got the atvs right out back .
should i get my helmet ?
helmet ? that &apos;s springfield talk .
is there gas in these ?
springfield talk !
well , how are we supposed to get fuel ?
private plane crashes .
ah , smell that unpolluted air !
you know , i &apos;m glad we &apos;re in exile .
yep , i never realized how much i hated
every single one of my friends and relatives .
i don &apos;t think this place is so great .
i &apos;m trying to make the best of things ,
but i &apos;m worried maggie is falling in with a bad crowd .
必有一伤
i miss our home , and i want to go back .
it &apos;s not perfect here ,
but it is close to nature
and if you have an axe to grind ,
wikileaks is right over there .
how &apos;re you doin &apos; , mr. assange ?
that &apos;s my personal information ,
and you have no right to know about it .
hey , but we &apos;re neighbors .
would you like to come over for a movie sometime ?
is it iraqi journalists being murdered ?
don &apos;t be ridiculous .
it &apos;s an afghan wedding being bombed .
well i &apos;ve got a really big secret for you .
i &apos;m not wearing any underwear .
you know , you should really get out less .
he &apos;s no ned flanders .
and i miss the springfield sign
and how every street is a dead end .
god help me , i even miss helen lovejoy
criticizing my brownies .
hey , baby , banned forever
doesn &apos;t mean you can &apos;t go back sometimes .
yes , it does .
pipe down , boy !
i &apos;m sneaking you back into springfield .
oh , smithers ?
homie , these disguises won &apos;t fool anyone .
pish tosh , smithers , and fiddle @-@ dee @-@ dee !
heh @-@ heh , nailed it .
hold it right there .
mr. burns , you might catch a cold out this late .
you want my jacket ?
here , let me warm my gun up for you .
excellent !
yeah , it wouldn &apos;t be you if you didn &apos;t say &quot; excellent . &quot;
you know what &apos;s great about you , marge ?
after all these years , you can still shinny up the donut
and then pull me up after you .
look ! a shooting star !
you ever wonder if there are donut shops on other planets ?
on a night like tonight ,
i have to believe there are .
strike ! whoo @-@ hoo !
want to make out over the foul line ?
ever since the day we met .
the old homestead .
remember when we moved in
and i talked like this ?
eh , there &apos;s no sex like fugitive sex .
home sweet squat .
yeah . this place is awesome ,
but it &apos;s not puppy @-@ safe .
and my little guy &apos;s coming home tomorrow .
someone &apos;s downstairs !
shh . i think i heard a pair of underpants
being picked up off the ground .
big ones .
it &apos;s them !
bart &apos;s mom and the fat guy !
let &apos;s turn them in !
not so fast .
this case was already cracked
by the last person you &apos;d expect :
the chief of police !
you really thought you could fool me
with that burns and smithers getup .
i mean , i &apos;m not the sharpest pencil in the ... pencil thing ,
but i &apos;m least as smart as a cat .
right , lou ?
uh , what breed , chief ?
i mean , i saw an abyssinian once
who could change channels .
eh , that is pretty smart .
all right , you caught us .
what are you gonna do about it ,
throw us out of town again ?
crucify them !
and screw the boulder in tight !
make them write monologue jokes !
cancel their subscription to the opera !
we hate opera !
then get them a subscription to the opera !
no ... !
i say shoot &apos; em !
now , hold on just a minute .
nobody said anything about shooting .
i did , just now .
that &apos;s right , you did . well , all right .
okay .
don &apos;t even bother shooting us .
we &apos;ve found a new place that we love ,
a place that may not have indoor plumbing ,
but it &apos;s got something we treasure more .
yeah ! non @-@ jerks !
maybe he &apos;s right--
we are jerks .
you want i should spray some of my jerk off on you ?
jerk指蠢蛋
uh ... it &apos;s okay .
in our new community ,
people accept others for who they are .
i thought i wanted to come back to my house ,
but instead ,
i &apos;m going to go back to my home .
well , bah to them !
let &apos;s go , smithers .
getting a little clingy , aren &apos;t we ?
oh , all right .
that &apos;s all it took ?
i just had to ask ?
well , i &apos;ve tightened the bolt .
i think we &apos;re good .
you sure this is a good idea ?
this is the outlands , boy .
ideas aren &apos;t good or bad ,
they &apos;re just free .
power on !
i was wrong-- there are bad ideas !
there are terrible ideas !
now i &apos;m over here !
i &apos;m on it .
lenny lenford .
you &apos;re a long way from your bar stool .
i &apos;m ... i &apos;m here as a friend ,
looking for a better way of life .
hey , lenny . welcome aboard .
now , i got to warn you ,
if you find a little black thing on your pillow ,
it won &apos;t be a mint .
i don &apos;t mind-- i want a fresh start ,
and so does carl .
get her off ! get her off !
let her slice off the tip of your ear ,
and she &apos;ll go right to sleep .
no .
that &apos;s not a choice you get to make .
ooh , this is pretty tasty .
yup . and i like how it &apos;s dissolving a hole in the cup .
hey , guys !
what can i getcha ?
forget it ! we don &apos;t need some big @-@ city bartender
charging us an arm and a leg for something
we can do ourselves .
sure , sure , i understand .
but if you change your minds ,
i &apos;ll be here in this cave .
i got a funny feeling our paradise
is about to get ruined by unwanted guests .
i probably shouldn &apos;t have given this place five stars on yelp .
well , i rented that plane .
吸毒和射击的好去处
oh , that tears it .
i am not comfortable being this close to medical care .
out of here .
what are you doing here ?
i , uh , heard everything was going great
in your new eden , with one flaw :
you lack a corrupt city government .
true , true .
and a school system that teaches to the tests ,
sneaks the kids the answers and still fails .
stop ! stop !
this is everything we put behind us .
you can &apos;t leave civilization , marge !
humanity is an inexorable upward march !
or was till the year 2000 .
well , i did miss a few things about the grid ...
like everything !
maureen dowd , we &apos;ve got a lot of catching up to do .
亲爱的奥巴马
i &apos;m sure someone will come back and tell me where they went .
if i go inside , they might not find me .
* we &apos;ll meet again *
* don &apos;t know where *
* don &apos;t know when *
* but i know *
* we &apos;ll meet again *
* some sunny day ... *
