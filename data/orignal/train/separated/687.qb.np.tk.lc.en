revenge s02e15
helen &apos;s no longer with us ,
but your orders remain .
deliver the program in its finished form ,
or your father dies .
i need proof that you haven &apos;t killed him already .
check the fingerprint .
no .
hey , jack , nice day for a sail , huh ?
amanda stole my computer ,
so i thought she could threaten conrad
into selling back the stowaway .
nate got nothing .
i &apos;ll see to it that girl can never come after me again .
go . let &apos;s go .
jack ! i love you , jack .
no . amanda .
you have to get him to a hospital .
i can &apos;t leave amanda .
my necklace .
amanda , no !
emily , get down !
take care of jack and my baby .
in its purest form ,
an act of retribution provides symmetry ...
the rendering of payment for crimes against the innocent .
but the danger of retaliation lies in furthering the cycle of violence .
still , it &apos;s a risk that must be met ...
when the greater offense is to allow the guilty to go unpunished .
ems , slow down . take a breath .
i took a breath , and now amanda &apos;s dead .
look , nate had every reason to go after jack and amanda .
we do not know that the graysons ordered this .
don &apos;t you dare defend them .
all i &apos;m asking you to do is press pause .
terrible things are happening to the people you care about .
i know that &apos;s not what you wanted when you started this .
i didn &apos;t start this , nolan . they did .
and if you don &apos;t understand that yet ,
i don &apos;t need you by my side .
whoa , whoa , wait . so what , you &apos;re gonna just
march over there and shoot the graysons ?
i need to get to the hospital .
ems , we have to wait
till someone calls us about jack ,
otherwise , they will know that we were the ones
that pulled him out of the water .
you need to slow down and rest .
and as far as me sticking by your side ,
i think you know by now ,
i &apos;m not going anywhere .
then don &apos;t ever tell me to let go
or to ease up or to forgive ,
not when i am standing here covered in the blood
of one of the only people that i ever loved .
where the hell have you been ?
amanda &apos;s dead .
what ? how ?
emily .
give her a minute .
oh , my god .
i &apos;m so sorry .
don &apos;t be .
you &apos;ve given me the one thing i thought i &apos;d never have ...
a real family .
you &apos;ve reached nate . you know what to do .
damn it .
where the hell is he ?
was that trask ? what did he say ?
no , it wasn &apos;t trask . he hasn &apos;t made contact .
so we have no idea if the initiative
is buying our story about amanda clarke ?
our story happens to be the truth .
the computer she threatened me with
is as real as the jeopardy we &apos;re in
as long as it remains out there .
then nothing &apos;s changed .
after all the plotting , scheming , and murder ,
this family &apos;s in as much danger as ever .
no , we don &apos;t know that either .
i mean , no news in this case could very well be good news .
they got him through surgery , and they took the bullet out ,
but that &apos;s all they &apos;ll tell me on the phone .
charlotte , what &apos;s happened ?
jack &apos;s been shot .
oh , my god .
mom , i need you to watch carl .
no , of course . where &apos;s amanda ?
we don &apos;t know . she hasn &apos;t checked in at the hospital ,
and she &apos;s not answering her phone .
i have to go .
all part of the plan ?
exactly how much blood are you two comfortable with ?
&apos;cause i just hit my limit .
one way or another , i &apos;m shutting these barbarians down .
daniel , wait .
answer it .
yes ?
we were able to recover ms.crowley &apos;s phone
and her scarf and a great deal of blood .
uh , and was it amanda clarke ?
we &apos;re reserving judgment till we locate her .
and the computer ?
still at large , assuming it exists at all .
my inspection of ms. clarke &apos;s premises was incomplete .
mr. trask , there &apos;s something we need to discuss face @-@ to @-@ face .
we &apos;ll come to you .
what have they done ?
it &apos;s what i &apos;ve done .
more to the point , it &apos;s what one nate ryan has done .
who the hell is nate ryan ?
so just to recap ...
amanda &apos;s dead , jack could be dying ,
padma &apos;s father &apos;s being tortured ,
and the only way to keep him from being killed outright
is to hand over a potentially lethal computer program
that only i can complete .
am i missing anything ?
no .
why do i get the feeling this isn &apos;t what takeda had in mind
when he handed you your revenge degrees ?
this is not the time to lose faith .
when exactly is the time , aiden ?
i have never seen her like this before .
i don &apos;t know if emily &apos;s in control anymore .
it &apos;s gotta stop .
this can &apos;t stop .
emily &apos;s need for revenge is all she has left right now .
you take that away , and i promise you ,
we will lose her , too .
charlotte just called .
jack &apos;s out of surgery . i &apos;m going over there .
what do you need me to do ?
continue hunting down the initiative .
now that conrad &apos;s running for governor ,
he &apos;ll be forced to vacate his seat on grayson global &apos;s board ,
which means that you can get closer to daniel
and finally get rid of helen crowley .
i think someone may have already beat me to that .
the phone &apos;s been disconnected ,
and padma &apos;s already been assigned a new contact .
then see if you can find out what happened to her .
what , you think it &apos;s the graysons ?
who else ?
are you coming , nolan ?
go .
how is he ?
well , he &apos;s lucky to be alive .
the doctor said , 2 millimeters to the left ,
it would &apos;ve gone through his liver .
do they know what happened ?
yeah , the coast guard found jack &apos;s boat
at the bottom of long island sound along with nate ryan &apos;s body .
and there &apos;s still no word on amanda .
i &apos;m so sorry .
i &apos;m gonna go home and check on carl .
uh , carl &apos;s at grayson manor ?
i couldn &apos;t get the a. c. fixed last night at the bar ,
and when victoria saw how overheated the baby was ,
she offered a room .
i need coffee . can you guys just keep an eye on him ?
victoria just pops in to the stowaway ,
last night of all nights ?
that &apos;s quite a coincidence .
i told you , the graysons are behind all of this .
and they &apos;re gonna pay .
this is an unusual choice of venue .
it doesn &apos;t offer much security .
for you or for me ?
the last meeting you called with one of our operatives ,
she vanished without a trace .
we told you that we didn &apos;t have anything to do with it .
yes .
according to you , she fell prey to one angry little girl
who , as serendipity would have it , has now disappeared herself .
i &apos;m sure you know by now
that what happened on that boat was no accident .
a low @-@ level criminal named nate ryan
had a vendetta against the groom ,
and apparently sought to terrorize
the both of them on their honeymoon .
how do you know all this ?
because he called me from the boat .
tricked me into confirming the existence of the computer .
to what end ?
financial reward .
in a plea for their lives ,
ms. clarke offered all the evidence against us as ransom .
so we should expect the computer to be raised with the wreckage ?
unfortunately , we &apos;re not experts in marine salvage , mr. trask .
i &apos;m sure the tides have a mind of their own .
all your problems wrapped up with a pretty bow .
not all of them .
and not as long as you continue to exploit our son
as proxy to whatever it is you &apos;re planning .
something you &apos;d do well to remember .
i don &apos;t think he bought your story .
well , assuming ms. clarke has indeed met her fate ,
there &apos;s only one person alive who can refute it .
jack porter .
mr. grayson ,
there &apos;s a mr. trask on line two for you .
says he &apos;s the new liaison for helen crowley &apos;s investment group .
put him through .
mr. trask , daniel grayson .
i understand you &apos;ll be taking over for helen crowley .
so far as a woman like helen can be replaced .
i trust she &apos;s all right .
she &apos;s moved on to greener pastures ,
though she always spoke quite highly of you ,
which is why we &apos;ve elected to keep our business at grayson global .
well , i @-@ i appreciate that .
if you &apos;ll check your inbox , you &apos;ll find a purchase request .
the sooner you &apos;re able to make these trades , the better .
well , i &apos;ll have a look this afternoon .
wonderful . we &apos;ll be in touch .
i see you &apos;re taking your coffee irish this morning .
what do you want , mathis ?
i want another bite at the apple .
back when you became c. e. o. , you told me
you &apos;d keep me in mind in the unlikely event
that a seat opened up on your board of directors .
now it seems that that unlikely event
is your father &apos;s play for the governor &apos;s mansion .
yeah , well , i wouldn &apos;t count on the success of that campaign .
successful or not ,
the fact remains that there &apos;s now an open seat on your board .
and you still want it .
i &apos;d like to think that i earned it .
if you recall , i was the one that brought you nolcorp .
and without that deal ,
you may not have been able to steer this company
back on the path toward profitability .
i think we &apos;ve managed to stay on that path just fine without you .
i assume you &apos;re referencing stonehaven .
there &apos;s a lot of money in disaster relief .
and it would appear that that deal
is working out rather well for both of us .
and how &apos;s that ?
well , when i learned that you &apos;d made
a priority of acquiring stonehaven
i took it upon myself to dissuade your competition
from outbidding you .
i &apos;m sorry . you spoke to prosser ?
yeah , i even flew myself out to los angeles on my own dime .
feel free to call him to confirm .
why would you do that ?
in advance of this opportunity .
look , i didn &apos;t want to appear meddling ,
only to be ready when the time was right .
look , we make one hell of a team .
you deal me back in , and i swear , the sky &apos;s the limit .
terrible thing that &apos;s happened .
the name &apos;s trask .
i &apos;m investigating the incident on the boat .
you are ?
emily thorne , the child &apos;s godmother .
you looking for something ?
uh , i just came by to get jack some clothes .
what exactly are you looking for ?
mrs. porter is as yet unaccounted for ,
as is the ship &apos;s dinghy .
can you think of any reason
why she might have wanted to disappear ?
disappear ? no , no .
amanda was happier than she &apos;s ever been .
you &apos;ll have to forgive me . i get paid to be suspicious .
yeah .
i see .
let me know when you have a positive i. d.
did something happen ?
i &apos;m sorry to tell you , ms. thorne ,
the coast guard just identified another victim .
female this time .
amanda &apos;s family is on their way over to identify the body now .
what family ?
her sister .
did you kill amanda clarke ?
good morning to you , too , ms. davenport .
that &apos;s why you chose yesterday
to announce your gubernatorial run , isn &apos;t it ?
you needed an audience for your alibi .
that &apos;s ridiculous .
horrific , some might say .
i know that you met with nate ryan
while jack and amanda were getting married .
i had to tell him the waterfront deal was off .
i had no idea it would result in all this carnage .
i don &apos;t believe you .
oh , well , then believe what you must .
and while you &apos;re busy pointing fingers ,
bear in mind that not only were you an active participant
in all my recent interactions with mr. ryan and mr. porter ,
you are actually the architect of the deal ,
not to mention a material witness
to amanda &apos;s treachery against me .
i had no issue with amanda .
what happened to her is a tragedy .
that &apos;s a sentiment i intend to echo at
the press conference you &apos;re about to arrange ,
unless of course this is your roundabout way
of tendering your resignation .
didn &apos;t think so .
how &apos;s jack ?
oh , the doctors say he could wake up at any time .
you okay ?
not exactly .
your deadline is imminent , ms. lahari .
fail to meet it , there will be consequences .
okay , look , don &apos;t panic .
not until we know if ...
what they sent you truly belongs to your father .
when will that be ?
look , i &apos;ll interface immigration
and check your father &apos;s fingerprint .
i &apos;m not handing over that program
until we know that your father is alive .
i know i betrayed you .
but you &apos;re the only person who can save him .
i &apos;m running out of time .
did--do you still have helen &apos;s number ?
it &apos;s been disconnected .
well , give it to me anyway .
she probably met that creepy voice mail guy somewhere .
her phone records might tell us where she was last .
you should get back to nolcorp .
they might be watching .
i &apos;ll meet you at the office , okay ?
is jack okay ?
he &apos;s still unconscious . declan &apos;s with him .
emily , i think you were right .
the graysons killed helen crowley .
what did you find out ?
well , the last two places her phone was used
were grayson manor
and then the stowaway the next day--
a place helen had no reason to be .
but victoria did .
my god , she was framing amanda
so the initiative would go after her and not them .
like father , like daughter ?
hey , any luck finding that computer ?
no . no .
but i don &apos;t think amanda would risk hiding it
anywhere near carl or jack .
i gotta go .
健康服务部下属部门
victoria .
emily .
where &apos;s charlotte ?
she insisted on going in there alone .
she &apos;s brave ...
like her sister .
well , there are moments in a person &apos;s life
that change you forever .
and i fear
that this is one of them for charlotte .
especially since she and her sister
had grown so attached .
you try to protect your children from all pain .
but to not be able to stop
what &apos;s going on behind those steel doors ...
you must feel so helpless .
mom .
oh , sweetheart .
baby , i &apos;ve got you . it &apos;s okay .
i &apos;m here . i &apos;m here .
i know you technically have free rein over this place ,
but believe me when i tell you ,
you do not want to mess with me , not today .
i &apos;m sorry about jack and amanda .
i @-@ i just heard .
i know you didn &apos;t come all the way across town
to deliver your half @-@ hearted condolences .
what do you want ?
you never sent me the report i asked for
detailing your abandoned r &amp; d.
yeah . guess i kind of forgot about it .
no , see , i don &apos;t think you did .
i think you don &apos;t want me to know about carrion ,
and you &apos;d rather get fired than tell me what it does .
let &apos;s see if you &apos;re right . fire me .
nolan ,
if i find out you &apos;ve done anything
other than destroy that program ,
i won &apos;t just fire you .
i will cripple you with lawsuits
and make sure you never write another line of code again .
you got it ?
control , alt , delete .
got it .
sweetheart , are you all right ?
how &apos;s little carl ?
perfect .
i keep checking to see if something &apos;s changed ,
if somehow he knows his mother &apos;s ... gone , but--
he &apos;s too little .
he couldn &apos;t possibly understand .
he will one day .
do you remember grandma grayson &apos;s funeral ?
until today ,
she was the only dead body i &apos;d ever seen .
and she was so beautiful .
but seeing amanda lying there ,
i wanted to just say it wasn &apos;t her
so i could pretend it wasn &apos;t true .
she had a very hard life .
not everybody &apos;s as lucky as we are .
the other thing i remember
about grandma grayson &apos;s funeral ...
were the hundreds of people
who came to pay their respects .
i can &apos;t find anyone outside of montauk
to invite to amanda &apos;s service .
her mom seems to have just ...
disappeared into thin air ,
and when i called the state
to see if they could help me find her foster family ,
they said i needed a court order to release the records .
well , maybe it &apos;s for the best .
amanda left that life behind when she came to town ,
and i fear that if you go down that road ,
you &apos;ll find nothing but pain .
需要和你谈谈 能在城里碰面吗
oh , darling , it &apos;s your brother .
nolan ross , life &apos;s pawn .
how can i help ?
i &apos;ve retraced every step amanda made .
the computer &apos;s nowhere to be found .
well , nothing &apos;s pinged on my end ,
so no one &apos;s turned the computer on ,
which means the graysons don &apos;t have it either .
and they may be losing daniel , too .
what do you mean ?
well , he came over here in person
to tell me to destroy carrion .
threatened to break my digital kneecaps
if i didn &apos;t comply .
he &apos;s having a crisis of conscience .
or maybe he &apos;s just freaked out
to realize he &apos;s actually got one .
problem is , mine &apos;s sending up red flags .
because of padma &apos;s father .
like i said , i &apos;m life &apos;s pawn .
i just have to figure out who &apos;s moving me next .
any word on jack ?
uh , no , not yet . i was about to head over .
firewall . i &apos;ll meet you there .
i heard they found amanda .
charlotte made the i.d.
is she all right ?
no .
no , she &apos;s not .
and what &apos;s worse ...
is victoria is using amanda &apos;s death
to get close to charlotte again .
without that love ... victoria would have nothing .
well , you &apos;ve always known how to destroy the woman .
her children .
how did i get so far off track ?
declan , hi .
okay . i &apos;ll be right there .
jack &apos;s coming too .
dec.
yeah , jack . i &apos;m here .
emily . where , where &apos;s amanda ?
is she okay ? where &apos;s carl ?
he &apos;s fine . he &apos;s with charlotte .
and amanda ?
emily ?
jack ...
she &apos;s gone .
oh , no , no , no .
i am so very sorry for your loss , mr. porter .
this isn &apos;t a good time .
no , i want to talk to him .
alone .
apologies , jack .
i assure you , it wasn &apos;t my intent to ,
uh , interrupt you in your hour of grief .
you can stop pretending . i know why you &apos;re really here .
the administrator just told me
you offered to pay my hospital bill .
well , you &apos;ve been misinformed .
i didn &apos;t offer . i insisted .
one of the last things you need to be grappling with right now
is a steep financial blow .
you &apos;re very generous .
tragedy has a way of bringing out our better angels .
and , uh , you know , in spite of our strained history ,
amanda was , um ...
family ,
as are you and your son .
listen , i take it as a personal failure
that i didn &apos;t recognize nate ryan was using me
to injure you .
well , you did the right thing in the end .
i just wish i could look him in the eye ...
and ask why ?
why did amanda have to pay for the sins of my father ?
son ...
just cherish the beautiful memories
you have of your wife
and keep them alive for baby carl .
i don &apos;t know how i can ever repay you .
well , he &apos;s , uh , he &apos;s doing quite well
given the circumstances .
sadly , i don &apos;t think
we &apos;re ever gonna know exactly what happened on that boat .
you know , i &apos;m gonna need some signatures from you .
jack , what are you doing ?
you just got out of surgery .
whoa , jack .
just lay back down .
i gotta get outta here and finish what amanda started
before it &apos;s too late .
too late for what ? what-- what are you talking about ?
the real reason amanda came back to the hamptons
is the graysons framed her father .
everything she needs to expose them
is on some computer she stole from conrad .
that &apos;s why they murdered her .
i gotta find it before grayson does .
just tell us where it is and we &apos;ll find it for you .
i don &apos;t know where it is . that &apos;s the thing .
look , you ca--you can &apos;t tell anyone about this ,
especially the police .
we won &apos;t , but you are much safer here ,
especially if what you say is true .
if you don &apos;t help me get out of here ,
i will walk out myself .
okay , listen , we will arrange for help at the stowaway ,
but it &apos;s gonna take some time .
just don &apos;t do anything until we come for you .
i &apos;ve been looking into the crash of flight 197 .
what exactly for ?
the companies that profited in the wake of the attack .
guess who owns a controlling stake
in the security systems manufacturer
for every major airport in the world .
grayson global .
everything we have is blood money .
and until i figure out
what nightmare they &apos;re planning for us next ,
i &apos;m done taking their orders .
daniel , now is not the time to raise red flags .
now if you want to rid our family
of these parasites for good ,
you have to do it surgically .
what , like the way you and dad cut them out 20 years ago ?
no . they can &apos;t force me to do anything .
yes , they can .
they &apos;ll just send someone in helen &apos;s stead .
i &apos;ll bet that you &apos;ve already had an unexpected encounter .
yeah .
two .
one from a man named trask
asking me to step up their foreign investments .
and the other ?
aiden mathis .
he claims to have helped sour jason prosser on stonehaven .
then he &apos;s one of them .
or he was just having my back ,
paving his way into the company like he said .
well , there &apos;s one way to find out .
give helen &apos;s accounts to him .
ask aiden to execute the trades .
and if he &apos;s one of the initiative ,
there &apos;s no way he &apos;s going to put his footprints
all over those financial records .
and if he does ?
then he &apos;ll have earned your trust ...
and mine .
thanks for all this .
don &apos;t worry . i &apos;m sending grayson the bill .
did you find anything ?
i turned this place upside down .
if amanda really did steal conrad &apos;s computer ,
it &apos;s definitely not here .
maybe they already retrieved it .
maybe that &apos;s why grayson &apos;s being so nice .
emily ...
i need to ask you something .
yeah . anything .
i know it &apos;s short notice with the funeral , but ...
would you give the eulogy ?
jack , i @-@ i ...
i don &apos;t know .
please .
i &apos;d--i &apos;d do it myself , but ...
after everything i learned on the boat--
the vendetta , the gun , the computer--
i &apos;m just not even sure i ... really ever knew her .
of course you did .
she was your wife , and she adored you .
the evidence is all around you .
there is no doubt in my mind
that amanda &apos;s love for you was real .
she would &apos;ve done anything for you .
except tell me the truth .
i need to be alone .
okay .
if you need anything , i &apos;m here .
charlotte ?
oh . sorry .
i just wanted to come and--and check in
and see how you were doing .
i haven &apos;t heard from you in a couple of days .
i guess i &apos;m more private than the rest of my family .
i heard your dad &apos;s ...
making a statement today .
i know , of all days .
i feel like i was just getting to know her .
i still had so many questions .
she had this whole past i knew nothing about .
and i hate that there will only be a few people
coming to her funeral .
it &apos;s all the people that mattered to her .
that &apos;s all that counts .
i guess you &apos;re right .
she just deserved such a fuller life .
well , i just wanted to check in .
i &apos;ll see you at the service .
emily .
she was lucky to have a friend like you .
你还在找阿曼达 · 克拉克的继兄吗
mathis , it &apos;s grayson .
morning . i hope it &apos;s good news .
uh , you tell me .
i &apos;m planning to present you
to the board for vetting at the next meeting .
that &apos;s not good news . that &apos;s fantastic news .
first i &apos;d like to showcase your value
by having you capitalize on some opportunities abroad .
happy to .
all right . let me know when you &apos;ve made the trades .
emily .
daniel , hi .
um ... i &apos;ve been meaning to call or stop by .
oh , you &apos;re busy . it &apos;s okay .
i &apos;m ... so sorry ... about everything .
do you think you &apos;ll be coming to the funeral ?
i know it &apos;d mean a lot to charlotte and ...
to me , too .
yeah . i &apos;ll be there .
good .
thanks .
the great state of new york
is built on the strength of its community .
the heart of the state is its populous .
to govern it all is to govern for all .
so when one of us is lost ,
it alters the state , the city , the citizen .
i invite you all to join me in mourning the loss
of amanda clarke ,
a life sadly cut short decades before her time .
a victim of circumstance ,
amanda led a troubled early life
but persevered through monumental odds
and created a loving family of her own .
she leaves behind her loving husband jack ,
her young son carl ...
and her half sister , my daughter charlotte .
and as my family mourns her loss ,
we cherish her memory .
hey , nolan . you watching this ?
someone turned on your computer .
tell me it &apos;s not at grayson manor .
worse . .. it &apos;s at the stowaway .
as new yorkers , as human beings ,
and , of course , as porters .
jack ...
my condolences .
thank you for your kind words , mr. grayson .
i &apos;m sure wherever amanda is right now ,
she &apos;s watching .. and smiling .
no , jack .
i saw you on tv . i &apos;m sure it wasn &apos;t easy
watching conrad capitalize on all this .
here . let me help you .
thank you .
i remember when amanda first moved in here .
she said it was the first place that ever felt like home .
except for her father &apos;s cottage ,
which ... now belongs to you .
you gonna put that in your eulogy ?
no .
what about your time together in juvie ?
i always wondered
how you got so close so fast .
did she pick you up from allenwood like she promised ?
it was in the duffel bag with the computer she was hiding ,
or you were both hiding as far as i know .
jack--
on top of all the misery ,
to find out that you were lying to me , too ?
you didn &apos;t just know each other . you were like sisters .
it was a part of my past
i didn &apos;t want anyone to know about .
why ? didn &apos;t want to tarnish your perfect image ?
the same reason you didn &apos;t tell me
what was happening with the ryan brothers--
pride , self @-@ preservation .
what else didn &apos;t you tell me out of self @-@ preservation ?
that amanda loved you from the moment that she met you .
and none of that ever stopped ,
not in the foster homes , not in juvie .
none of that was a lie .
did you know about her plan for the graysons ?
jack , this was so--
actually , you know what ? i don &apos;t want to hear it , emily .
you &apos;re carl &apos;s godmother . if you knew ,
i can &apos;t believe you would let amanda put herself ,
all of us , in that kind of danger .
jack , i am so sorry about everything .
i don &apos;t have time for this .
i gotta bury my wife in an hour .
please ...
just go .
shouldn &apos;t you be at the funeral ?
i &apos;m leaving in a few minutes .
i &apos;ve been up ...
all night working on carrion ,
finishing it .
the fingerprint matched your father &apos;s immigration file .
one funeral &apos;s enough for today .
i just hope there aren &apos;t countless more
coming down the pike .
i can &apos;t tell you what to do , padma .
but when they make contact ,
keep in mind
that the people that took your dad
don &apos;t have the best track record
when it comes to fulfilling their end of the bargain .
death is a thief .
it takes and keeps all that a person is ...
that a person was .
and when death takes from us
someone as extraordinary as amanda ,
it takes with it not just her past ,
but who she was to us every day .
amanda was special .
but she never had it easy .
a childhood torn from her ...
a rough adolescence ,
and a damning identity that was thrust upon her ,
which she bore with dignity
until she made herself a new name--
amanda porter ...
we can trust aiden . he made the trades .
a name that was her own ,
free from the binds of history ...
looking forward with a man who loved her for ...
all of her strengths ...
and all of her weaknesses .
amanda , all of us here today have embraced you ,
and we love you .
we will protect ...
the husband and child that you leave behind ,
the sister that you were just getting to know .
and we will greet every new day as a gift ,
approaching it with the same bravery
and determination
with which you lived your entire life .
thank you for coming ,
your whole family . you didn &apos;t have to do that .
well , we all wanted to , son .
i was , uh , hoping i could come by
and visit you next week .
maybe talk about finding a way to honor amanda .
our door is always open .
always .
i &apos;m sorry .
i don &apos;t know if he &apos;ll ever forgive me .
he &apos;ll come around .
i wanted to tell him the truth .
he deserves that .
someday , maybe .
right now , regardless of how he feels ,
you can &apos;t take amanda away from him again .
nolan .
you think you can come back to the bar with me ?
i got some computer problems i need your help with .
of course .
yes .
the boy knows nothing .
it was a lovely speech .
unfortunately ,
despite their best efforts ,
david and his daughter were plagued by darkness .
at least he wasn &apos;t here to see her go .
to lose a child like that ...
no one should have to bear that kind of loss .
grayson .
back in your hands where it belongs ,
for you to do with as you wish .
what are you doing ?
protecting jack like i said i would .
the evidence on that laptop
could send the graysons away for lifetimes .
the kind of punishment i came here for
had nothing to do with prison .
that computer was never part of the plan .
it only clouded my judgment .
so back to basics ?
no more distractions .
grace , can you come here ?
what time have you got ?
7 : 40 , why ?
this clock &apos;s running slow .
you mind taking it to the shop ?
no problem .
if you like it , you can keep it .
my watch works just fine .
did you know her well ?
very .
the amanda clarke i knew was a survivor .
never thought i &apos;d find her here .
how did you know her ?
she burned our house down .
who are you ?
i &apos;m her brother .
