the graysons murdered my father
tell her about the white @-@ haired man .
there was a man who visited grayson
the morning your father died .
this feeling comes along once or twice in a lifetime ,
if we &apos;re lucky .
i want full immunity in exchange for the information
i &apos;m about to give you .
this is agent mcgowen of the s.e.c.
come down to the federal building
and answer some questions .
would you like to comment on the allegations of corruption ?
my father is the victim of a witch hunt .
conrad confessed everything to daniel .
he could &apos;ve come clean .
he could &apos;ve ended the whole thing .
what are you gonna do now ?
i &apos;m gonna track down the man who killed my father .
they say grief occurs in five stages .
first , there &apos;s denial ...
followed by anger .
then comes bargaining ...
and depression .
hey , did you know
that amanda turned 10 this summer ?
whatever happens with your investigation ,
can you make sure that a copy of this interview gets to her ?
i guess i just want amanda to know that ...
not every day is a terrible one .
your dad had a good day today , sweetheart .
i hope you did , too .
i love you .
for most , the final stage of grief
is acceptance .
but for me ...
grief is a life sentence without clemency .
i will never accept and i will never forgive ,
not even after the man who killed my father
lies dead at my feet .
agent mcgowen canceled his one @-@ on @-@ one interview .
what do you think that means ?
it means their fishing expedition
came up empty .
well , that &apos;s good news .
chances are , mcgowen is just gonna head for deeper waters .
so what do we do in the meantime ?
we keep the p.r. machine running overtime
to mitigate the damage they &apos;ve already caused .
ashley &apos;s plans to tie your wedding
into rehabilitating our corporate image
is a very good one .
just make sure emily &apos;s on board with that .
and ... we need to ensure
that the outstanding loose ends from your trial
remain tied up ,
mainly ... that jack porter
keeps his version of the events of that night to himself .
i &apos;ve got a plan for that .
good . get on it , son .
daniel ...
i can &apos;t tell you
how much your loyalty through this challenging time
means to me .
family first , like you said .
but when we &apos;re through this ,
i wanna hold you to the promise you made me .
100 % transparency from here on out .
are you watching ?
yeah .
what do you think daniel meant about his plan for jack ?
i don &apos;t know what he &apos;s capable of anymore .
business as usual , i see .
what the hell are you doing here ?
the feds are all over me .
precisely the reason for my visit .
emily ...
you &apos;ve become , as they say in your profession ,
a bad asset .
look , i understand your employers are nervous ,
but i assure you ...
i have all of this handled .
i &apos;m afraid your word isn &apos;t going to satisfy the initiative .
well , what else can i possibly offer ?
that question is being addressed as we speak .
handsome family .
you must be very proud .
my god , ems ...
it &apos;s him .
emily , are you there ?
i &apos;m here .
what are you gonna do ?
i &apos;m gonna create a reason for them to meet again .
and then i &apos;m gonna track the white @-@ haired man
to wherever he &apos;s hiding .
and then ?
you already know the answer to that .
第一季第二十一集
you feeling any better ?
your headache last night--
i can &apos;t remember you being sick the whole time i &apos;ve known you .
well , we haven &apos;t known each other all that long ,
have we ?
emily , what &apos;s going on ? talk to me .
what ever happened to paris ...
eloping , just the two of us ?
that was before everything .
all right , grayson global has a massive image problem ,
and since i &apos;m the one who &apos;s largely responsible ,
i feel like it &apos;s my job to fix it .
by making our wedding a big , public spectacle ?
look , ashley and i are cutting out early today
so she can pitch us her ideas .
a big , splashy wedding ,
one of your parents &apos; events--
it &apos;s not exactly me or you the last time i checked .
last time i checked , you were practically pushing me
to claim my father &apos;s mantle at the company .
look , ashley &apos;s put a lot of work into this ,
and it may not be you or even me ,
but given what my family &apos;s been through ,
can we just sit down with her for five minutes ?
please .
of course i can .
i love you .
have a good run .
dr. clemons is here .
should we find somewhere else to do this ?
not if you &apos;re comfortable in here .
i &apos;d hate to interrupt the progress you &apos;re making .
it &apos;s ironic , right ?
daniel goes free ,
and now i &apos;m the one basically under house arrest .
打开
no school , no father ,
no friends , no declan .
in terms of school ,
i &apos;ve already spoken to the dean ,
and you will be starting again next week .
and as for declan ,
do not forget that his lies
are what put you here in the first place .
his and yours .
speaking of which ,
dr. clemons wants to do a family therapy session tonight .
that is never going to happen .
why , because you and dad despise each other ?
dr. clemons says
the only way i can overcome my anger issues
is to learn to forgive ,
which will be a whole lot easier to do
if you and dad do the same .
ready to get started ?
yes , why don &apos;t you , charlotte ?
we &apos;ll talk about this later , hmm ?
mrs. grayson .
agent mcgowen ,
why isn &apos;t my ex @-@ husband in prison ?
because we haven &apos;t found any physical evidence of
a conspiracy to frame david clarke .
well , then you haven &apos;t looked hard enough .
before conrad &apos;s head of security was murdered ,
he told me that he had personally amassed enough evidence
to put everyone involved in jail for good .
now have you searched his manhattan apartment ?
our warrant is restricted to the corporate offices .
and the prosecutor can &apos;t build a federal case on your word alone .
well , he won &apos;t have to .
you and your team are obviously incapable of
finding the proof that you need ,
but i assure you that i &apos;m more than capable .
i &apos;m determined .
do you think i don &apos;t see right through this ?
see through what , porter ?
it &apos;s a check , not a shoe bomb .
it &apos;s blood money .
it &apos;s to keep me quiet about your parents
framing their personal thug for tyler &apos;s murder .
you &apos;re wrong .
the guy was a drifter .
he had no ties to my parents
other than the fact that he was blackmailing them .
they were victims of his , too .
really ?
come on , buddy . drink some water .
okay , look , i get you don &apos;t trust me .
i &apos;m trying to fix that ...
still not feeling well , sammy ?
for emily &apos;s sake .
she told me how invested in haiti you are ,
and i know my trial threw off your plans
to get down there and help .
i also know you have this bar and your brother
and a girl somewhere out there that you care about .
and i just thought this money might help you ...
do some good in the world ...
any way you choose to use it .
i see you &apos;ve been redecorating .
i find your choice of fine art in the foyer
to be very inspired .
yeah , well , the de kooning has a sentimental value .
ah . you look good , conrad .
and you look like a demonic succubus .
you think i didn &apos;t know that
you were the one who sicced the s.e.c. on me ?
i &apos;ve done no such thing .
if you go down ,
you &apos;ll only bring me down with you .
you &apos;ve already told me that a thousand times .
you can trust me , i &apos;m not gonna go down without a fight .
well , as strained as things have been between us ,
you know i wouldn &apos;t want that , conrad .
well , then i assume you &apos;re here
to return the key to the apartment .
no , charlotte &apos;s the reason i &apos;m here .
her addiction counselor has called for
a family therapy session this evening .
now how shall i report back ?
oh , you can tell her ,
i wouldn &apos;t miss that for the world .
that &apos;s not for you .
hello , victoria .
lydia .
ever the opportunist , i see .
what &apos;s she doing here ?
what she does best--
using her children as a wedge issue for ...
what is it exactly that you came here for , dear ?
oh , well , then ,
please allow me to invite you to leave .
so this is where you live .
yep , it &apos;s home sweet home .
cool .
my uncle owns a cop bar .
i spent nearly every night there growing up
before my mom won the slimy rich husband lottery .
yeah ?
you , uh , you want to go a round of shuffleboard ?
i @-@ i think we should just plow through this econ project .
it &apos;ll take me two seconds to kick your ass .
look , kind of something i used to do with my ex .
oh , right , the , uh , pill head .
charlotte &apos;s not a pill head .
she &apos;s been through a lot .
yeah , well , who hasn &apos;t been through a lot ?
i just moved here from yonkers ,
which , for the record , is ten times harder
to get out of your system than oxy .
it &apos;s a joke , declan .
sorry for trying to make you laugh .
yeah , i &apos;m not in much of a laughing mood these days .
getting that .
clearly , you don &apos;t want to be here ,
and neither do i , so , uh ,
let &apos;s just get this over with .
what on god &apos;s green earth am i encrypting ?
home video .
of you and daniel ...
sleeping .
mm . i need you to e @-@ mail an anonymous copy to conrad .
okay .
this is getting kinkier and creepier by the moment .
may i ask what you hope to gain by this ?
conrad will see it as a threat .
he &apos;ll think the white @-@ haired man is spying on his son ,
and he &apos;ll be forced to reach out to him .
you may be a lot of things--
black belt in karate , impeccable dresser ,
and a certified sociopath--
but you &apos;re not a killer .
you don &apos;t know what i am or what i &apos;m capable of .
and you don &apos;t know what he &apos;s capable of , ems .
who &apos;s to say he won &apos;t kill you first ?
that &apos;s a risk i &apos;m willing to take .
send it .
i see my credit cards got some exercise this morning .
oh , nothing &apos;s better than the second floor of bendel &apos;s .
sounds like you &apos;ve had a pleasant day .
monique lhuillier offered to design a wedding dress for me .
seems someone gave her the impression
we &apos;re headed for the altar .
victoria playing one of her little games , no doubt .
not that it &apos;s the worst idea .
they do say third time &apos;s the charm .
you really know how to sweep a girl off her feet .
i &apos;m gonna have to call you back .
okay .
yes ?
yeah , i got your message , you son of a bitch .
there &apos;s a restaurant at the corner of 7th avenue
and 10th in brooklyn . you be there at 5 : 00,
or i unleash a contingency plan of my own .
emily .
where are you headed off to in such a rush ?
i have to go get ready .
i &apos;ve got my monthly meeting with the landmark committee .
not today you don &apos;t . we got a wedding to plan .
i &apos;m so sorry . i &apos;m gonna have to reschedule .
emily , i cleared my afternoon for this .
you knew that .
i &apos;m sure the landmark committee can survive a month without you .
but unfortunately ,
my epic plans for your wedding may not .
i promise ,
i &apos;ll make my presentation as painless as possible .
杰克 · 波特 一百万美元
$ 1 million ?
jack ...
you must really have them worried .
the graysons are the last people i want to be indebted to ,
but if emily &apos;s already planning on joining &apos; em ...
look , i @-@ i was thinking
i could start a charity with the money .
maybe it &apos;s something she and i could do together .
you still care about her , don &apos;t you ?
we both do , don &apos;t we ?
i care about you .
that &apos;s why you have to cash this ,
&apos;cause if you don &apos;t ,
they may find a more ...
permanent way of keeping you quiet .
oh . gotta take this .
nolcorp japan .
konnichiwa .
if you meant what you said
when you promised to help avenge my father ,
then i &apos;m asking you to prove it to me right now .
ems ... calm down . breathe .
i can &apos;t . i &apos;m stuck here with daniel ,
and i &apos;m not gonna make it to the city on time .
in-- in time for what ?
the video worked .
conrad &apos;s meeting the white @-@ haired man
at a restaurant at 5 : 00 .
this might be my last chance to track him down
before he disappears again .
i need you to go there and follow him home ,
find out where he lives .
ems , what &apos;s going on ?
i &apos;m just , uh , letting the committee know
that i won &apos;t make it on time .
yes , absolutely .
the meeting should go on without me .
that &apos;s right . it &apos;s the corner
of 7th ave. and 10th street in brooklyn .
i &apos;ll call you later .
oh , well , we &apos;re getting a little ahead of ourselves ,
aren &apos;t we ?
i &apos;m calling conrad .
we used to be such good friends , lydia .
what happened ?
you held me hostage at grayson manor
after your attack dog threw me off the roof of my own apartment .
well , you certainly have a knack
for landing on your feet , now don &apos;t you ?
what are you doing here , victoria ?
conrad &apos;s finished with you , and so am i.
i am giving you a lifeline .
the question is , are you wise enough to accept it ?
i learned that lesson already .
fool me twice , shame on me , right ?
well , in this case , the shame is on all of us .
after all these years ,
the government is quietly building a case against conrad
and his role in the downing of that plane ,
not to mention what happened to david clarke .
and given that you perjured yourself
all those years ago in federal court ,
they &apos;re going to be coming after you , too .
you did this , didn &apos;t you ?
well , let &apos;s just say , i got the ball rolling .
and i had the good fortune to secure myself immunity
in exchange for my cooperation .
and as your friend ,
i &apos;ve asked them to grant you the same courtesy .
i couldn &apos;t help but notice the de kooning
the last time i was here .
conrad had it relocated from his office .
he said it was the most important piece in his collection .
it isn &apos;t worth the canvas it &apos;s painted on ,
and he knows it .
i don &apos;t understand .
it &apos;s a forgery .
i know because i had it commissioned ,
and i passed it off on him .
that &apos;s how we met .
the question is ...
why would conrad hold on to something
that he knows has little value whatsoever ?
other than you , of course .
obviously , we &apos;re not talking william and kate territory ,
but you are considered american royalty .
well , daniel is .
your heritage is still a little bit of a mystery , emily .
but in this case , that &apos;s a good thing .
we can spin the fairy tale any way we want .
emily .
you know where i stand .
i &apos;m a very private person . always have been .
you can have an intimate wedding
and still generate plenty of public interest ,
not to mention press opportunities .
front page of the sunday style sections ...
like i said , i got your threat , loud and clear .
you &apos;re the only one issuing threats here .
contingency plan ?
that &apos;s right .
names , dates , video recordings , bank transactions ,
the original hard drive from david clarke &apos;s computer--
every piece of evidence from the first day
you darkened my door 20 years ago
straight through to the prison murder of lee moran last month .
it &apos;s quite a dossier .
mutually assured destruction .
damn right .
if you ever threaten to harm my son ,
his fiancee , or anyone in my family ever again ,
i detonate .
i never threatened your son .
i &apos;m not gonna play this game with you .
whatever the hell &apos;s going on , you stay away from my family ,
or i &apos;m gonna expose you and your employers to everyone .
do you understand ?
that &apos;s it .
daniel , what are you doing ?
who &apos;s so important that you can &apos;t be present with me
on this for five minutes without exchanging texts ?
it &apos;s none of your business .
and none of this is me .
have you forgotten who i am , who you &apos;re marrying ?
have you ? i &apos;m a grayson , emily .
there are certain pressures and expectations placed upon me ,
upon us .
maybe you &apos;ve forgotten the family you &apos;re marrying into .
trust me , daniel .
i couldn &apos;t forget your family if i tried .
i &apos;m done .
ashley--
please don &apos;t say you &apos;re sorry . you so clearly are not .
hey , dec , you seen sammy ?
no , i thought he was with you .
did you check upstairs ?
i checked everywhere .
who &apos;s sammy ?
my brother &apos;s dog .
it &apos;s freezing out there .
you didn &apos;t let him out and then forget , did you ?
no , no , in fact , i &apos;ve had a hard time
getting him to go out at all these past couple days .
i &apos;m gonna go look for him .
give me a call if he shows up , okay ?
yeah .
screw the presentation .
if you want to go look for him , let &apos;s do it .
i finally got rid of ashley and daniel .
tell me you didn &apos;t lose him .
i &apos;ve got an address .
he &apos;s there now .
thank you , nolan .
once you turn this corner , emily ,
everything changes .
are you certain you want to do this ?
it &apos;s the only thing i &apos;m certain of anymore .
text me the address .
i &apos;m working on a solution .
first i have to identify who &apos;s threatening grayson &apos;s family .
this isn &apos;t some nosy fed we &apos;re dealing with .
someone &apos;s on to us .
be right there !
can i help you ?
uh , yeah , i &apos;m here about
the , uh , cable outages in the neighborhood .
i didn &apos;t know there was a problem with my cable .
oh , yeah .
the brownouts fried all the boxes on your block .
you didn &apos;t notice the lights flickering ?
come on in .
he couldn &apos;t let you do it .
where is he ?
he wouldn &apos;t say .
clearly , whatever it is you &apos;re planning tonight ,
it &apos;s not the answer .
hey , i wonder what your father would think of this ?
he &apos;d probably wonder how his little girl
got to such a point .
alone . that &apos;s how i got here .
but you &apos;re not alone .
nolan intervened so that you wouldn &apos;t make
a life @-@ altering mistake .
it &apos;s not his job to protect me .
no , that was your mother and father &apos;s .
what i remember about my mother
is that she was sick my entire childhood
until she died ,
and as for my father , well ,
we both know what happened there .
you are so strong @-@ willed ,
just like david was .
death comes on its own .
there &apos;s no need in hastening it .
tell that to the people
who were on the plane when it exploded .
there might be a time and a place for kindness and fairness ,
but this is definitely not one of them .
good @-@ bye , carole .
this , uh , clock shows official u.s. time , which , uh ,
i can see might be of interest to you .
or not .
sorry for the inconvenience .
one more thing before you go .
do you have a card ?
so i can talk to your supervisor ...
to tell him how ...
happy i am with the service .
coming to fix a problem i didn &apos;t even know i had .
um , you know , uh ...
i don &apos;t .
we &apos;re practically , uh , a paperless company .
you know , trying to offset our carbon footprint .
uh , we do have a web site
where you can submit a form .
i &apos;ll do that , burt .
what &apos;s your last name ?
uh , simmons .
have a good evening .
you , too , burt .
lydia ...
what &apos;s happened ?
victoria ...
i came home , and she was here ,
tearing your painting into pieces .
she said you were hiding evidence
that could destroy us all .
i @-@ i tried to stop her , but i couldn &apos;t .
that woman is a monster , conrad .
you knew what this meant to me .
i can &apos;t believe you would betray me with the one thing .
i didn &apos;t betray you , ems .
i &apos;m giving you options .
now at least you can gather intel on the guy .
find out who he is .
you listen to me , nolan .
how about you listen to me for once ?
hello ?
sammy ?
sammy , hey , buddy .
sammy !
jack .
emily , hey .
sammy &apos;s here .
thank god .
i can &apos;t believe i didn &apos;t think to look there .
is he okay ?
jack , i think you better hurry .
it &apos;s okay , buddy .
mrs. grayson , why don &apos;t you go first ?
dear charlotte ,
i like that you &apos;re taking your counseling seriously ,
but i need you to stop demonizing me
and lionizing your father .
both of you .
good .
who &apos;d like to go next ?
i &apos;ll go .
glad you could join us , mr. grayson .
so what game are we playing ?
we &apos;re playing &quot; i like but i need . &quot;
it &apos;s fun . you &apos;ll see .
just sit--
that &apos;s all right , doc . i &apos;ve got this from here .
daniel ...
i like very much
that you &apos;ve made the family business your own ,
and all i really need from you
is your continued loyalty through the rough days ahead .
charlotte , i like that you &apos;ve taken control
of this problem ,
and i need you to promise me that you &apos;ll stay on this track .
victoria , you know , believe it or not ,
i actually like your spirit of self @-@ preservation .
always have , in fact .
and i thoroughly appreciate how much you have challenged me
at every turn throughout the course
of our spectacular failure of a marriage ...
oh , mr. grayson , that &apos;s not--
because it has taught me how to see ...
right through you .
and as for what i need from you , well , by gosh ,
all i really need is for you to come to your anemic senses
and return everything you just stole from me .
and , conrad ,
i like that you suspect me , predictable as you are ,
but i need you to know
that others have been betraying you as well ,
even while warming your bed .
mom ,
what have you done now ?
nothing i wouldn &apos;t do again .
this is hopeless .
nothing in this house is ever gonna change .
the only way out of it is to leave .
bravo , conrad .
that display of yours should go miles
towards helping charlotte &apos;s recovery .
i can get him into the truck , take him back to the stowaway .
he used up all his energy getting here .
i think this is where he wants to be .
even after all these years ...
he &apos;s home .
you know , every day ...
every day &apos;s been a gift .
i was starting to think he was gonna live forever .
i can &apos;t do it .
i don &apos;t know if i have it in me
to say good @-@ bye to him .
sammy ...
sammy , thank you .
thank you for being such a good friend ...
such a good listener .
and thank you for making me smile ...
every day , even on the worst of &apos; em .
thank you for teaching me about loyalty ...
and friendship .
thank you for teaching me how to love .
oh , sammy , thank you , thank you , thank you .
thank you , thank you . thank you .
sammy .
are you licking daddy ?
oh , yeah , that &apos;s great .
oh , sammy .
it &apos;s okay . it &apos;s okay .
you go on now , okay ?
you go play .
you go play .
we &apos;re right here .
come on .
who splashes someone with ice @-@ cold slush
and just drives off ?
a trucker from yonkers .
well , look , let &apos;s get you dry .
um , i got towels in the bathroom .
but one second .
here .
um , do you have any pictures of your dog ?
we can take the poster boards
from that presentation we &apos;re gonna fail
and put them to good use .
good idea .
declan .
oh , what are you doing here ? are you okay ?
they &apos;re awful , declan ...
my entire family .
look , i &apos;m ...
i &apos;m so sorry for pulling your tuition .
i &apos;ll cash in one of my savings bonds--
actually , i got it covered .
or nolan does . i mean , the guy &apos;s got a ... heart
as big as his checkbook .
see ?
someone else appreciates how good you are .
can i stay with you tonight ?
are all your t @-@ shirts deep v &apos;s ?
you &apos;d do great with the girls back home in yonkers .
wow . you work fast .
oh , charlotte , it &apos;s not what you think it is .
yonkers , huh ?
didn &apos;t even need the trashy tee to figure that one out .
what did you just say ?
because i &apos;m pretty sure you don &apos;t know
the first thing about my life .
you , on the other hand , are a walking tabloid .
everyone has things in their past
they don &apos;t want people to know about .
right , declan ?
are you really so blinded by your hatred for dad
that you &apos;ve lost sight of me and charlotte ?
i have always had both of your best interests at heart .
your father is guilty of heinous crimes , daniel .
and what about you ?
i know the whole story , so you can quit playing innocent .
dad told me everything .
i don &apos;t know what lies he told you ,
but you would do well to remember
that there are three sides to every story .
oh , and which one did you sell to the feds ?
you go through with destroying dad ,
and you &apos;re dead to me .
he was a really good friend .
so were you .
oh , jack , i &apos;m so sorry .
i &apos;m so sorry .
i &apos;m so sorry .
i think that should be it .
i &apos;ll go get him .
are you okay ?
it &apos;s just nice , having somebody with me .
i always thought it would be amanda .
now it feels like the only part of me
left hanging on to her is gonna be buried with him .
maybe sammy knew it was time for you to let go .
maybe that &apos;s why he jumped up on you in the park that day ...
why he kept running over to your house .
he was leading me to you .
emily ...
what are we gonna do now ?
i don &apos;t know .
you &apos;re late .
relax .
i &apos;m going to agree to your ultimatum .
my devotion to you trumps everything , daniel .
i only hope that i can repair the damage i &apos;ve caused .
this is the evidence i was planning on turning over .
now your father had it stashed away for years as insurance
because he &apos;s not the only one it incriminates .
what you choose to do it with it ...
is entirely up to you .
yes , daniel ?
mom buckled . she gave me the evidence .
it &apos;s right here in my briefcase .
good work , son .
bring it to me in the morning .
dec ...
i got some bad news .
sammy ?
he &apos;s gone .
i was just gonna call you .
oh , to yell at me again for saving your life ?
no .
to thank you .
i &apos;m starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel .
if i had gone through with it today ...
there &apos;d be no light ...
ever .
but now ...
we have got eyes inside his house .
you shoulda seen me , ems .
i hacked into an electrical grid ,
jammed a satellite , and ...
paid off a cable guy .
you &apos;d have been proud .
i am proud .
you &apos;re a good friend .
i gotta go .
they say grief occurs in five stages .
first , there &apos;s denial .
emily ?
followed by anger .
daniel , i &apos;m so sorry .
oh , babe , i , uh ...
then comes bargaining , depression ,
and acceptance .
come on . let &apos;s go to bed .
but grief is a merciless master .
just when you think you &apos;re free ...
you realize , you never stood a chance .
