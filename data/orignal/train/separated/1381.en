Tessa, honey, you home?
Oh, she wanted to stay at Kimmy's one more night.
Parents aren't nearly as cool as Kimmy.
Mm, not a chance.
We having a red or a white?
A pink.
Raul the towel boy taught me his secret cocktail recipe.
It's on my phone.
Raul with the muscles?
When were you mixing cocktails with him?
Right after my husband
decided to cut our Mexican vacation short
so he could make a business meeting.
You think I'm jealous, but I'm not.
I know you love this dad bod.
I do.
Now, slice me a lemon.
Yes, ma'am.
You think Raul would go all the way into the kitchen
to get you a lemon?
Thanks, sweetie.
Gonna have to be a lime, hon.
That's fine.
Thank heaven for tiny miracles, huh?
If Banyan hadn't left his blood on that cutting board,
we wouldn't be starting the trial today
and he wouldn't be looking
at a long sentence for robbery and homicide.
Witness list?
Yep.
M.E. Report confirming Banyan's blood on the cutting board?
Yep.
Initial response report indicating
that Hammonds' side door was open?
Yes.
Search warrant for Banyan's apartment?
Yep. Fat lot of good it did us.
No knife, no red emeralds.
Oh, maybe Nina can provide us
with some up to the minute good news?
Sorry, I double checked with NCIC,
and all the local pawn shop records.
Unfortunately, the red emeralds
stolen from the house haven't turned up.
Finding them after two years was a long shot.
Thanks for making the calls.
Thanks.
So, we have no murder weapon,
and without the gems, we have no motive.
There's no chance we're gonna lose this case, are we?
Oh, we've won cases with less than DNA on a cutting board.
I'm just glad we have this.
We have to meet Banyan's lawyer
at the evidence warehouse in five minutes.
Rizzoli.
What do you mean it's gone?
I have no idea what happened.
After you checked out the cutting board
for trial prep last week,
I put it right back where it belonged.
And nobody's checked it out since?
No. Other than you,
it's been in the same spot for two years.
Then when the defense sent their request
to review the evidence,
I made myself a little note
to have it ready first thing this morning.
So, as soon as defense made the request, it disappears?
Yeah. Here we are.
B572.
No cutting board.
Did you check the adjacent boxes?
Yes.
Okay, we need to search every box in here.
There's four floors of evidence.
I really don't have the manpower for that.
You will.
Thanks.
We got to call Banyan's lawyer and tell him it's gone.
The lawyer's gonna move to dismiss the case.
Hey, ma. It come yet?
Honey, you have the strangest shopping habits.
You opened it?
What if it was private?
You had it shipped to a bar!
So Nina wouldn't see it.
She likes magic shows.
Thought I'd learn a few tricks, surprise her.
You're such a sweet, sweet boy.
Awesome.
Rizzoli.
What?
All right, I'm there.
Sorry, ma. I got to go.
Work.
Of course it's work.
My kids always work.
Bye!
Bye!
Is it possible that someone from your office
got the cutting board?
I'm afraid not.
And there's no other physical evidence
that ties Banyan to the scene?
No, but here's what we have.
We have the swab that we used to retrieve Banyan's DNA.
We have photos of the cutting board from the crime scene
and in the lab, and DNA documentation proving
that it was Banyan's blood.
The defense won't be able to dispute chain of custody.
It's a hail Mary,
but it might be enough to put in front of a judge.
"Hail Mary" is such an odd phrase.
You know, when it was coined in 1975 --
Maura, Jane go court now.
Thanks. Bye.
Along with the photographs and lab report,
the sworn testimony of Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Maura Isles
should be more than enough to proceed.
Your Honor, defense simply can't run its own forensic analysis
on a series of photographs.
If the people can't produce the cutting board for our review,
this case needs to be dismissed.
Counselors, approach the bench.
Jane?
Yeah.
What's going on?
Tessa, something happened, okay?
But we're -- we're working on it. Okay?
Detective Rizzoli.
Just hang tight.
I've been told there's a problem with evidence management.
Uh, yes, Your Honor.
We, um -- we're working hard to produce the physical evidence
that the defense has asked for.
we just need some more time.
I sympathize with your predicament, Detective,
but without evidence, this case cannot go to trial.
As it is 4:00 P.M. Friday, you have until 9:00 A.M. Monday
to find this evidence,
or else I'll be forced to grant defense's motion to dismiss.
Next case.
Banyan did this.
I don't know how he did it, but he did it.
Well, we better get going,
'cause we've only got 65 hours to undo it.
We've already finished with rows 1 through 8.
You can check rows 9 through 11 down there.
Any luck?
No cutting board in the first two sections.
We got 10 more sections to search on this floor.
Any evidence missing from any other cases?
It's definitely looking like a targeted job.
Did you speak to the evidence officers who were on duty?
None of them saw any suspicious activity.
Banyan could've paid one of them off.
I ran background checks on all employees
with access to the evidence room.
All of them long-term employees, no apparent financial motive,
no apparent ties to Banyan.
So, if it's not an inside job,
someone from the outside broke in.
Only way in is the way we came.
What's up?
Banyan got someone to break in and steal the cutting board.
Trying to figure out how they might've got in.
Is this the only point of entry?
Yeah. To be granted access,
you have to enter a six-digit code
that's changed every week.
Yeah, and I'm sure the system logs in the date
and time of everyone's entry.
Yeah. Those records are already on their way.
Okay.
Tell me about the security system.
The evidence officer we spoke to
said they recently upgraded the facility.
Beside the keypad they put in a new climate-control system
and additional security cameras.
Get the footage from the last week.
We need to review that.
If the cutting board was only taken in the last day or two,
maybe it's still out there.
It's a good thing Ming's Palace is open all night.
Okay, what are we looking at?
Left side is a list of every date and time
that someone entered the evidence room.
And the right side is different
security camera feeds from the warehouse.
We're going through to see if we can identify the thief.
Oh, right there, right there! Bottom right.
Blow that up.
Back it up.
Now enhance it.
There's the code, clear as day.
Nina, is this camera system closed circuit?
Yes, but sometimes these systems have a remote login function
so that supervisors can check in.
If our thief could log in remotely, he could get the code.
Hang on.
Most of these logins look like warehouse supervisors,
but this one's anonymous.
That's how our crooks got the code.
Is there any way to trace that login?
Yes, but it could take more time than we have.
Okay, well, we know when they got the code,
so let's just look for it every time it was used going forward.
Hey, um, can I have the honey walnut shrimp?
Uh, yeah.
Thanks.
There's no shrimp.
There's a lot of honey, a lot of walnuts.
Hey, wait, someone just blacked out the camera
covering the entrance to the evidence room.
Could they have gotten into the building
from another room down there?
Well, the only rooms down there are the maintenance room
and the evidence room.
They're made of concrete. No way in.
We need to look at all of Banyan's associates,
figure out who's smart enough to pull this off.
CSRU didn't find any physical evidence at the warehouse.
So, our thief got in and out without a trace?
Yeah, and no prints on the evidence box,
but we will do a full battery of tests.
Thank you.
Kent? What are you working on?
Oh, I, uh...
I found him in the pond by my house this morning.
Is it sick?
Yeah.
Won't even take any water,
not even this fancy stuff with added electrolytes and vitamins.
I got you a few liters I stuck on your desk.
Thank you.
Yeah, you're both healing. You ladies deserve the best.
Was the pond you found it in dirty?
Aren't all ponds?
Well, if the water was polluted, a duck can contract botulism.
Oh, of course.
Good one, Sergeant.
When I was a kid, my aunt had a place up on Lake Winnipesaukee.
I used to feed the ducks.
We may have some antitoxin on hand.
Or you can just give it water with Epsom salt.
Right. Old wives' remedy.
The old wives are the ones
that gave me the bread to feed the ducks.
You know, you two are alike.
Both animal lovers.
I don't think we're alike.
No, me neither.
Call me if you get something.
I'm thinking of calling her Mary, as in Mary Stuart.
As in Mary, Queen of Scots?
She deserves a royal name, don't you think?
Such a regal creature.
Well, except Mary Stuart was executed by her cousin,
Queen Elizabeth.
So, maybe she should have the name
of a queen that wasn't beheaded.
Well, I'm not gonna call her Elizabeth.
No English queen is a queen to me.
Billy Mags was arrested with Banyan in the '90s,
but he's doing a 20-year bit at Walpole.
"Whitey" McCormick was hanging his hat
"白人"
at Souza-Baranowski for the last year.
Well, Jones got in trouble with the law in Mexico.
Finch has been dead for two years.
Frankie, what's going on with the prison logs?
And the ball magically melds with the cup.
Frankie!
What?
I'm on hold. They're taking forever to pull the logs.
Moving at a snail's pace.
No.
I saw the second ball hit the table before the cup dropped.
You did not.
Yeah.
No, yeah, I'm still here.
Are you sure?
All right, thank you very much.
So, apparently the only person who visited Banyan in prison
is his 82-year-old mother.
No friends, barely any family.
Who the hell is helping Banyan?
Pizza and Chinese, eh?
Yeah, it was a long night.
And there was a shrimp deficiency.
I did a particle trace analysis on the empty evidence box.
Found traces of urea-formaldehyde foam.
Which is used for what?
It's an insulation most commonly found
in old commercial buildings.
Like the evidence warehouse.
Yeah, except the only place we found it
was on the evidence box.
Well, that means that the thief must have left it on the box
when he opened it to steal the cutting board.
Didn't you say something about a climate system?
Yeah, they installed it six months ago
for better temperature and humidity control.
To install a new system,
wouldn't you need to cut through walls?
Yes, you would.
Yes, you would. Thank you.
You're... welcome.
All these vents required a cut through the wall
and the interior insulation.
Hey, Korsak, look at this.
You see the insulation?
That vent look bigger than the other ones?
Yeah.
It's magnetized.
Guess we know how they got into the building.
So, the thief built a tunnel
from outside to the maintenance room,
walked across the hall,
entered the entrance code to the evidence room,
and stole our cutting board.
Seems like something out of "Ocean's 11."
Or "12." Or "13."
Somebody's been planning this for a long time.
Six months at least,
since they installed the climate-control system.
Whoever's helping Banyan was on that crew.
Yeah. I already got a list from the contractor.
50 people altogether.
Well, we better start digging.
We only have 41 hours left.
Dig fast.
Hi, I got your text. You found something?
Yes. CSRU found several hairs in that tunnel.
DNA analysis shows they belong to a Caucasian woman.
Okay, well, that'll help narrow our search
for the construction crew.
Thanks, Maura.
You look tired.
Jane, are you sure you don't want to lie down,
take a little power nap, maybe 20 minutes?
I don't have 20 minutes.
I'm serious.
Sleep deprivation could cause cognitive dysfunction,
memory problems, even hallucinations.
You should tell the octopus in the corner to stop waving at me.
Yeah.
Good girl.
Okay, this is the weirdest thing
I've seen in the last week and a half.
I'm sorry.
She's sick.
I couldn't very well leave her in the lab, could I?
You have to take her back!
Somebody might call the Health Department on me.‬
The rights of nursing mothers should not be infringed upon
in the commonwealth.
What?
All right, well, I know it's not the same thing,
but surely the same principle applies.
Okay, now I'm more worried about you than I am the duck.
Even though she's kind of sweet.
Isn't she?
Hello.
Yes, say hello, Cleopatra. That's a good girl, yeah.
Fancy name.
Yeah, Egyptian queen of the desert.
Beloved by all.
I learned in my G.E.D. Class that, uh,
her brother tried to overthrow her, so she had him killed.
Oh, right. So, maybe not Cleopatra, then.‬
What?
Okay, so the food's ready,
and that's so nice of you to bring it to them.
Thank you.
Well, I guess we're just not as slammed
down in the M.E.'s office as they are upstairs.
By the way, do you see, uh, Frankie and Nina a bit?
How's that going?
I guess you're gonna have to ask them.
We keep it strictly professional at work.
Yeah. I can see.
Hmm, fair point.
Do you mind if I break her a wee bite off,
see if she's hungry?
Oh, no, not that one.
Why not?
Duck a l'orange.
Hey there. It's okay.
Yeah.
There were only four Caucasian women
on the construction crew
that installed the climate-control system.
One of them, Ashley Marks,
was hired two weeks before the job
and quit immediately after.
That's more than a little suspicious.
Turns out she's a licensed heating
and cleaning service tech, but in Chicago.
Could she have been in town working?
Sure, if she hadn't been severely injured
in an accident three years ago.
According to these disability records,
she hasn't worked since.
This also popped up in the search.
Who's Donna Marks?
Ashley's sister.
She had several run-ins with the law back in Chicago.
She could've used her sister's work I.D.
since she's been living here for six months.
She could be the one helping Banyan.
Is there anything linking them?
E-mails, cellphone records, love letters?
I'm looking, but nothing so far.
All right.
Hey, will you text me her address?
It's already in your phone.
Sounds like she's home.
We got a runner!
Boston police!
Boston police!
All right, get down! Get down.
You're under arrest.
What'd you do with the cutting board, Donna?
I found it.
You destroyed evidence
that could've convicted a double murderer.
Do you have any idea how much trouble you're in?
What I can't figure out is why you did it.
You don't seem to know Steve Banyan.
There's no correspondence between the two of you at all.
There's no e-mails, no texts, no phone calls, nothing.
You only moved to Boston six months ago.
Banyan's been locked up for two years.
Why would you do something like this for a complete stranger?
Maybe it felt like a thrill.
Yeah, you brought quite the rap sheet with you from Chicago.
Assault and battery, prostitution --
Yeah, I know. I was there.
What I don't see there
is any higher education or technical training.
So?
So you have no technical knowledge
to bypass a security system.
If you don't think I did it, then let me go.
No, no, no. We know you did it. We have your DNA.
What we want to know is who planned it.
I don't know what you're talking about.‬
You know that if you give us a name,
we can talk to the D.A. about reducing your sentence.
Understand this, Donna.
Whoever planned this risked your ass, not theirs.
You really want to stand up for somebody like that?
It's a pretty ring.
Yes, it is.
Tell me you have good news.
It appears she burned it, doused it in lighter fluid,
and then she burned it again.
No traces of DNA.
from the victim's kitchen.
So, you're telling me
that the only piece of evidence we have against Banyan --
Exists only in photographs and test results.
But you know that she broke in and she stole it,
so can't you use that?
No, not without a connection between Banyan and Donna,
which we don't have.
So, what are you gonna do?
Keep digging, I guess.
Well, I do have an extra set of clothes in my office
if you'd like to dig in a fresh shirt.
At this point, it'd be a public service.‬
This ring belonged to Donna.
What kind of stone is that?
It's too light to be a sapphire or blue topaz.
My off-the-cuff assessment might be a blue benitoite.
Extremely rare.
Rare like red emeralds that were stolen from the Hammond house?
Well, depends on clarity and color,
but stones like this could go for $20,000 each.
Are you thinking that Donna and Banyan pulled another job?
Maybe.
Or maybe it was Donna and the guy she's working for.
Who's that?
I don't know yet.
Here we go.
Come on.
Looks like a radioactive booger.
Okay, this is citrine. It's very fashionable.
Also has the added benefit of being visible from space.
You can't see it from space.
I don't think.
Morning, Holiday.
Is it morning? I'm losing track.
Walk with me.
Donna had a rare gemstone on her person --
blue benitoite.
Search for thefts involving that stone.
Okay.
I'd expand my search outside of Boston.
We're looking for Donna's accomplice.
Whoever she's protecting will connect back to Banyan.
Any cities you want me to focus on?
Well, Chicago's Donna's hometown.
How is this gonna help?
It might not,
but if we can find who Banyan was working with,
maybe we can get him to turn on Banyan
in exchange for special treatment.
Got it.
I'll meet you in BRIC.‬
I got to take this to Kent.
What, he can't fetch his own coffee?
This isn't coffee.
I must be delusional from lack of sleep this weekend.
Things are moving.
They're wormies for the wee duck.
Wormies?
‭What would you call them?‬
Disgusting?
I'll see you in BRIC.
Hi.
Hi, what's up?
I just put on a fresh pot.
Should be ready soon.
I'm trying to do the coin-through-the-hand trick.
No, you're not.
Okay, give me the coin.
What?
Give me the coin.
You're doing it all wrong.
You have to make it look effortless, okay?
‭Seamless. Cup your hands.‬
Like that?
Yeah, exactly.‬
Ready? One, two, three.
What?!
That was amazing!
Yes, I know.
How'd you learn that?
Do you remember when we were little
I always got to go to bed an hour after you?
Yeah.
Well, that's because Mom and Dad
and I were up having really fun magic parties.
I always knew you guys were doing awesome stuff without me.
We were.
They also paid me 100 bucks for every trick I learned.
Okay. You're joking.
No, I'm not.
You're joking.
Come on, Nina's got something for us.
Seriously, you're joking, right?
No.
What do you mean? You are joking about that.
Okay, what do we got?
Three unsolved gem thefts in the Chicago area.
All private residences in wealthy suburbs.
No arrests were made.
Jadeite and musgravite in Glencoe,
painite in Lake Forest,
and your blue benitoite in Highland Park.
Okay, whoever Donna is working for
has to have his hand in all of these.
Did the Chicago departments connect these robberies?
No, but I called and let them know.
Maybe it's not just Chicago.
You think he hit other cities?
Well, he's got Donna in Chicago, Banyan in Boston.
I'll widen the search nationwide.
Okay.
I know.
Well, it's just so... bright.
I think my pupils are still adjusting.
It's citrine.
You know, technically I think that's a jewel tone.
You know, technically I think you're Ma's daughter.
Here we go.
Five more cities.
Total of eight more places.
We're gonna need case files for all of them.
And 2.1/2 more weeks to go through them.
We talked to cops on all eight other gem thefts.
The pattern's the same as our victim's.
In every case, the thieves stole distinctive stones
from wealthy gem collectors,
and they all got through high-end security systems.
Canton, Ohio, was the only other case besides ours
where the victims were home.
They were also murdered. Amy and Sam Reichart.
Eight thefts with two additional murders.
How did we not see this two years ago?
We had no reason to look for it.
They were all out of our jurisdiction,
and we had an open and shut case.
The Cleveland cops are calling the case the Houdini whodunit.
And why's that?
Because they have no idea how the thieves got in or out.
What about the other locations?
Entry point was unclear for all the other cases,
except for Canton.
The front door was open.
So, we have no idea how they got in or out,
but they left the door open in the homes
where they murdered someone?
What if Banyan was already in the house
when the Hammonds got home?
And killing them is what forced him to leave through a door?
Exactly. He deviated from his original plan.
Which was what?
Go out the same way he came in.
Which was how?
I don't know, but the evidence warehouse,
they came in through the vent,
so maybe there's something we missed.
Kent!
And your friend.
Still here.
Yeah.
Rihanna and I have just been out shopping.
Rihanna?
Oh, yeah, the Queen of Barbados.
That's the reason I got some bling.
Well, I got something for you, too.
Does it sparkle?
Ha, ha, very funny.
It's a new restorative yoga clinic
that's opened up next door to the pet store.
Yeah, Rihanna was feeling so much better after a little exercise,
I thought that maybe you could you know.
Thank you. I'll check it out.
So, does this mean she's fully recovered?
Yeah.
Better than ever, aren't you, Rihanna?
Well, you know what this means.
Yep.
I am the duck whisperer.
"A" -- you need more human friends.
And "B" -- she's ready to go home.
Yeah.
I guess you're right.
I guess I just got a little bit attached.
Oh, I know it's hard.
But sooner or later, you have to let go.
Bye, Rihanna.
What does she know?
Exactly. That's what I thought. Come on.
Hey, Nina!
Angela.
Hi. Jane and Frankie are out on a case.
Oh, that's okay. I was just bringing in
some reinforcements for everybody.
Ah, thank you.
We ran right through the last batch.
Italian is my favorite.
Is that right?
Frankie's been teaching me to cook.
We did chicken parm last week.
Well...
that's a first.
Is that right?
Well, he only cooks for me on Mother's Day.
Maybe I'll get him to work on that.
You two seem to have a lot in common, don't you?
Well, we have a few differences.
I love the opera.
Oh, opera, no.
He was brought up on Motown.
No way.
Well, that would explain
why I could never get him to a show with me.
Yeah, he'd much rather be at any game, any sport.
He can have them.
Oh, tell me about it.
Frankie Sr. used to get us Bruins tickets.
Front row, blue line.
Anybody who got checked into the boards,
Frankie would cheer!
I would scream.
‭You had front-row tickets?‬
Well, his father used to say,
"I know a guy who knows a guy."
Can I tell you a little secret?
Okay.
I don't think Frankie will ever be as good of a cook as you.
Does he think he will be?
He thinks he's close.
Well, other than a healthy sense of delusion,
he's a great son.
Yeah.
He really is a great guy.
I haven't been back here since Mom and Dad were...
Hey, Tessa.
Why don't you go back to your aunt's house.
Okay? We can lock up when we're done.
I really wanted to help.
And you have.
Detective Rizzoli's in the squad car outside.
Why don't you let him take you home.
Okay.
Thank you.
There's the A/C vent.
That can't be more than 10 inches wide.
Nobody getting through there.
No.
All right, let's search the rest of the house.
Hey, court's first thing tomorrow.
Did you see her face?
We can't leave until we find something
that keeps that bastard in jail.
Korsak!
Look at this.
The frame's a little scratched,
but there doesn't seem to be any other signs of tampering.
All the screws are intact.
Thanks. His buddy was meticulous.
He could've had him just replace everything as he went.
Except look here.
The sheathing's sticking out.
Right, so if the seal was broken,
that would explain the condensation on the table,
the water mark on the rug.
When we photographed the crime scene,
they wouldn't have been here,
but two years of rain and snow, there you go.
I just got off the phone with Nina.
All the other robbery sites had skylights.
And they're not usually meant to be open,
so they wouldn't be wired to the security system.
Hey, guys, I know I've not been to the gym in a while, but...
there's no way one man could've lifted that down on his own.
No, you're right. Somebody was here with him.
Banyan and his partner pulled this job together.
Whose blood is that?
You're sure that's blood?
It's a little eroded and oxidized, but yeah.
We always thought that Banyan cut his hand
on a knife on the cutting board.
He could've done it right there.
If that's Banyan's blood, we can lock him up for good.
If it's his partner's blood,
he could walk out of the courthouse today.
How long's it take to get DNA results?
As soon as we get a swab to the lab, best bet's an hour.
It's 8:02. Court starts at 9:00.
That's cutting it close.
Hi, this is Detective Jane Rizzoli.
I need to speak to the District Attorney, please.
Yes, immediately.
Thank you.
Are the people seriously standing before me
asking for another continuance?
Your Honor, if I may,
the police department just needs a little more time.
This is outrageous, Your Honor.
We had a deal.
Sorry, Sergeant.
Ms. Stanwick, Mr. Dayton is correct.
Defense's motion is granted.
This case is hereby dismissed without prejudice.
Mr. Banyan, you're free to go.
What the hell's going on here?
My client would like to go home.
I thought I was a free man.
Yeah, we wanted you to think that.
Mr. Banyan had a partner.
He orchestrated multiple robbery-homicides across the country.
And he had Donna Marks break into the evidence warehouse
and destroy the cutting board.
Okay, well, who is this mystery partner?
That's what we need to know.
And we needed you to look like a free man
so we could draw your partner out.
My charges have been dismissed.
About that.
We found new evidence that'll put you away for good.
You left a little DNA on the skylight at the Hammonds' house.
Well, you can't charge me again.
而基于辩方合法权利撤销的案子可再审
That's double jeopardy.
I dismissed the case without prejudice.
Which means I can re-file charges any time.
If you tell us who this guy is,
the D.A. will consider the possibility of parole
on your life sentence.
Come on, Steve. We get it.
You kept your mouth shut 'cause he said he would get you out.
He's not gonna destroy your evidence twice.
We will get him with or without you,
so you have only one choice,
and that's if you ever want to see a sunset again.
I told you I'd come through for you.
I told you I'd keep my mouth shut.
Check the trunk.
Boston police! Get out of the car!
Now, now, now!
Shit!
Boston P.D.!
Freeze!
Stay down!
Stay down! Stay down!
Don't move.
Hands behind your back.
You want to come talk about it?
I'm fine.
I've got wine.
Oh, well, that changes everything, then, doesn't it?
Take a seat.
I don't know why I feel like this over a silly duck.
An adorable duck.
When I put her back in the pond, she just swam away,
not even so much as a "thank you" quack.
You think you know someone.
Well, that's right.
Make fun of me, why don't you?
I was just trying to make you laugh.
Well, this'll definitely help.
Cheers.
Cheers.
Well, I think you should be proud
that you got the duck healthy enough to go home.
I just hope the duck thinks so.
I know it sounds ridiculous, but...
It just hurts to think that she doesn't need me anymore.
When she swam away, I...
I think I even called out her name.
Not so much as a look back.
She may not have responded because
she was actually a he.
What are you talking about? Female mallards are brown.
So are males this time of year. They're in molt.
They only sprout colorful plumage during mating season.
Let me say what Rihanna should have.
Thank you for helping her get through
this really awful time.
She couldn't have gotten through it without you.
You took wonderful care of her.
And she should've told you sooner.
Rihanna does seem a little bit ridiculous now‬
in the light of things.
Thank you... for saying that.
I think the duck would've also added that
I'm a very handsome chap.
Yeah, don't push it.
You're starting to look like Grandma
with those bags under your eyes.
I'm too tired to be insulted.
And tonight I sleep for a week.
I think the record for sleep deprivation is about 19 days.
Hold up. This is something
that you don't know the exact factoid on?
Wow, maybe the both of you are sleep deprived.
Well, the "Guinness Book of World Records"
no longer keeps statistics on this subject
for fear that those competing for the title
would suffer ill effects.
Sometimes I think you're actually a robot.
I do know how to do the robot.
No, you don't.
Yeah, I do. You taught me.
Not like that.
Like this?
No.‬
You're hurting me.
I have a little surprise for you.
Yeah?‬
So, your mom was telling me
how much you love the Bruins.
Oh, of course.
Bruins tickets? Front row?
How did you get these?
Oh, I know a guy who knows a guy.
Well, thank you.
I have a little surprise for you, too.
Oh. Okay.
You got something right there.
Oh, what's that?
It's a coin.
Look. Boom.
Aww. Look at him. He's putting on a show for her.
Does that mean that they're getting serious?
Oh, definitely.
Yeah, Ma, 'cause it goes first base,
second base, third base, magic tricks.

Okay.

Okay. Open your hand.

You are the Fabulous Freakie!
Well, I learned everything I know from
the Jazzy Jane.
Is that right?
How did you learn, Jane?
Well, she won't tell me.
I learned from my high school boyfriend Johnny.
Was he cute?
Very cute.
You showed me his photo.
It was the two of you at the beach, remember?
It doesn't look like he had any clothes...
Really?
No.
So whatever happened to Johnny?
He pulled a real disappearing act.
Did you say disappearing act?
No, I did not.
Oh, I think I know that trick.
No, you really don't.
Okay.
Okay.
Now you see me.
Now...
you still see me.
See, there was supposed to be more smoke.
So what?
So you could like run out the door and disappear?
I mean it's not like there's a trap door here.
Okay, fine, you know what? Do it again.
Okay.
This time really run out the back door and disappear.
Nina, tickets.
No, you will not take these tickets.
We are... you are not gonna take these tickets.
Please do the trick again.
I'm not gonna...
You're so good at it. Please.
