well , look who &apos;s here ?
ana and i work in the program together .
i got 60 days , clean .
i don &apos;t ...
let &apos;s just go somewhere and talk , ok ?
so she can lie to me again ?
we got a letter from ana .
she wants to see the twins to make amends .
did she really send you a letter , asking if she could see us ?
yes , she did .
well , i want to see her .
my dad won &apos;t let me sleep
over at your house because he thinks you &apos;re gay .
i know you &apos;re not . i have to do what he says .
you made it seem like you just
found out so jesus would miss his team dinner .
that &apos;s not true . i was upset ...
yeah , that emma was going to be there .
i didn &apos;t get the principal job .
the woman who got it isn &apos;t even really an educator .
she &apos;s corporate .
what &apos;s going on with you ?
is it wyatt ?
we &apos;re kind of taking a break .
you having trouble being with wyatt ?
you &apos;ve gotta get some help .
we &apos;ve gotta convince the neighbors
that having us here is actually a good thing .
hence , community day .
everyone out ! out of the house !
so would you like a drink or anything ?
i can ... water or iced tea .
i can make you an arnold palmer .
no , thanks .
i have to get to work . i was just dropped by
to see how it &apos;s going , with girls united .
well , it &apos;s not really going anywhere .
i mean , no one wants to rent to a group home .
couldn &apos;t you buy a house ?
yeah , if i won the lottery .
hey , how &apos;d you get my address ?
oh , um , you can pretty much
find out where anyone lives on the internet .
well , this is it . what do you think ?
i think i &apos;d give you an unacceptable .
so , um , what about the county ?
can &apos;t they help you find you a house ?
right now they &apos;re threatening to revoke my license .
why ?
because one of my girls
nearly burned a house while we were in it .
that wasn &apos;t your fault .
no , but it &apos;s my responsibility .
there was underground stuff going on
that we should have told you about .
well , you know what ? maybe it &apos;s all for the best .
why do you say that ?
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m tired , callie .
she can &apos;t just give up .
you blame her ?
county &apos;s always breakin &apos; her balls over things
like loose toilet seats
when other group homes are barely feedin &apos; the kids .
and you know most the girls ,
they all about attitude , not gratitude .
what if we , like , organize a fund @-@ raiser ?
like a bake sale ? you know how much a house cost ?
too bad one of us doesn &apos;t know somebody rich .
i &apos;m not asking robert for money .
ok . you know , if it wasn &apos;t for sophia ,
i &apos;m not even sure we &apos;d have a relationship at all .
what ?
speak of the devil .
excuse me .
so , i probably should have called .
it &apos;s ok .
no , i promised i wouldn &apos;t show up , without your mom &apos;s knowing .
but i wanted you to hear this from me , first .
she &apos;s been here a lot on school nights
we &apos;re studying .
yeah , right .
brandon gets to rehearse on school nights .
hey , leave me outta this .
hayley &apos;s going through a hard time ,
her parents are getting divorced .
boy , has she milked that one .
i thought she was your friend .
she is . it &apos;s just when it comes to guys
she can be like super needy .
oh , i &apos;ll tell her you said so .
you better not .
connor can be kinda needy . it &apos;s not just girls .
sorry .
hey , you got slammed , huh ?
like five minutes before my shift was supposed to end .
thought we were giving away food .
let me make your plate .
no , it &apos;s ok .
why can &apos;t i get a job ?
you can when you &apos;re 16 .
all right , so i have some news , everyone .
the new principal starts tomorrow .
have you met her ?
not yet .
it should have been you .
no sour grapes .
i hope she &apos;s nice .
she can &apos;t be worse than snatchez .
what did you call her ?
uh , i have some news , too .
good , i hope .
robert quinn has offered to have a fund @-@ raiser
at his house for girls united .
wow , that &apos;s generous .
so , you asked him for help ?
well , i asked for rita .
that was a nice thing to do .
yeah , so it &apos;s this saturday .
wow , that &apos;s fast .
yeah , robert thinks they can pull it together .
can we help ?
you know , maybe ... do you think the band would play ?
really ?
you guys are great .
yeah . i have to ask everyone .
what can we do ?
just come .
can i invite hayley ?
no .
it &apos;s mostly just gonna be their friends .
we &apos;ll , all be there .
and i have some other news , too .
robert signed the abandonment papers . so i can get adopted .
talk about burying the lead !
that &apos;s great .
oh , my goodness .
oh , our baby !
that &apos;s good news .
* you mean everything to me *
* i give it all away *
* if you say you &apos;ll stay *
* true love isn &apos;t just a dream *
* so shake me wake me *
* and make it all reality *
so , you know , it &apos;s a work in progress .
but it &apos;s got that 80 &apos;s sound you were talking about .
i like it .
it &apos;s sweet .
sweet ?
you know me , i &apos;m not really a one true love kinda girl .
it &apos;s a little ... soft , for me .
i &apos;ll re @-@ write it then .
i like the melody .
yeah , no , the lyrics , so i &apos;ll &quot; edge &quot; it up a bit .
we should work on the set for this weekend .
sorry , i gotta bounce .
but we need to rehearse more .
well , i can &apos;t cancel , i have a date .
i &apos;m free the rest of the week .
yeah , i &apos;m good . we &apos;ll have jasper , too .
all right .
later .
what ?
dude .
lou has a history , with boys in the band .
she blows through them like the wind .
but there &apos;s nothing going on .
yet .
look , the other guys were no loss
but we &apos;ve got great chemistry . i don &apos;t want any drama .
me either . don &apos;t worry .
so , like , how many guys ?
so , have you guys talked about ana ?
if you &apos;re sure you want to see her , we &apos;ll arrange it .
she &apos;s just gonna cry and say how hard she &apos;s tried
but nothing ever works because everyone &apos;s against her .
you don &apos;t know what she &apos;s gonna say .
i know she &apos;s the reason that mom got shot .
and i know she knew it when she showed up at the women &apos;s shelter
and acted like she needed my help
when really she just wanted more money for drugs .
ok , well , you don &apos;t have to see her .
don &apos;t worry , i &apos;m not .
i &apos;m done . can i go do my homework ?
yeah , ok , go ahead .
you didn &apos;t take out the garbage !
honey , i know , just ...
fine . i &apos;ll do it .
it &apos;s hard not to resents ana .
she got to have her babies and she didn &apos;t take care of them .
it &apos;s not fair .
i know .
i &apos;m totally unqualifie for this job .
i know that &apos;s what you &apos;re thinking .
no , i wasn &apos;t ...
that &apos;s what i &apos;d be thinking .
and i &apos;d resent the fact that
they hired someone with a business background
instead of an experienced educator , like youself .
well , i &apos;m sure they had their reasons .
they think you can run a school like a business .
i think they &apos;re wrong . i can make anchor beach solvent .
but i can &apos;t make it a good school , without you .
i &apos;m giving you complete authority over curriculum .
we &apos;ll share administrative tasks
and i &apos;ll focus primarily on budget and finance .
i would like to find the funds to
reinstate the music and arts and school club programs .
and athletics .
we don &apos;t want to lose students because we don &apos;t offer team sports .
agreed .
good . we &apos;re on the same page .
oh , hi , jude , come on in .
this is our new principal , ms. porter .
this is my son , jude .
oh , nice to meet you .
nice to meet you .
and you can call me monte .
well , i &apos;m gonna go get settled in .
great .
hey , buddy , what &apos;s going on ?
i need to talk to you about connor .
so it &apos;s gonna be a casual garden party .
we &apos;ve invited mostly friends .
it &apos;s short notice , but we expect a nice turn out .
well , if there &apos;s anything i can do , please let me know .
i think it would nice if you spoke .
ok .
and callie , we thought you could introduce her ?
sure .
maybe you could bring some of the girls ,
so they could share their stories with the guests ?
hmm . you know , it would be difficult
to get the girls in juvenile detention sprung for the day .
but actually , cole and kiara are in group homes ,
so that shouldn &apos;t be a problem .
and daphne .
oh yeah , daphne as well .
uh , there &apos;s also something else we need to discuss .
when our friends ask us what our connection is with girls united ,
and with you , callie , what should we say ?
we think it should be up to you . what we tell people .
and whatever you decide is ok with us .
um ... i think , if you could
just tell people we &apos;re friends or something .
i can &apos;t tell people you &apos;re my sister ?
honey , callie &apos;s going to be surrounded by a lot of strangers ...
what about when they say how much we look alike ?
everybody always says something .
we smile and thank them for the compliment .
and we respect callie &apos;s privacy .
so , should i come by early saturday morning to help set up ?
sure .
why don &apos;t you sleep over , friday night ?
then you &apos;ll be here and we can get ready together .
you &apos;re welcome , of course .
yeah , sure . that would be fun .
you think i hit my son in the face ?
is that what you told them ?
no .
i was trying to give him a spanking
and he ran away from me , into a door jam .
that &apos;s what i said .
ok , so why am i here ?
connor , would you mind stepping out so we can talk to your dad ?
mr. stevens , do you think it &apos;s appropriate
to spank a thirteen year old boy ?
i think it &apos;s none of your damn business .
and quite frankly , this is all your fault .
my fault ?
yeah .
you were the chaperone on the seventh grade camping trip ,
and allowed our sons to spend the night in a tent together
without my permission .
why is that a problem ?
because her son is gay .
which i have no problem with ...
clearly you do ...
really ? would you allow a boy and
a girl to share a tent ? no . you wouldn &apos;t .
my son has not defined his sexuality in any way .
the point is , connor knows the rules .
whose rules ?
mine , my rules , for my son .
and he violated them , ok ? and i punished him .
do you know the definition of bullying ?
connor doesn &apos;t bully your son .
making threats , spreading rumors ,
attacking someone physically or verbally
or excluding someone from a group on purpose .
connor stands up for jude .
i &apos;m not talking about connor .
i &apos;m talking about you . you are the bully .
i told him his dad would be angry if we shared a tent .
i &apos;m partly to blame . i ...
i knew he didn &apos;t want connor spending the night here ,
but i guess ...
i just think he &apos;s wrong and ridiculous .
maybe we shouldn &apos;t be friends .
no , that is not the answer .
so , do you think it &apos;s true , that he didn &apos;t hit connor ?
i don &apos;t think he hit him in the face .
look , i don &apos;t want you to worry .
ok ?
i &apos;m dealing with this .
ok , go up and do your homework .
maybe they shouldn &apos;t be friends .
what ? why would you say that ?
there are other kids in his grade
who have parents who are progressive and kind .
so the bully wins and connor suffers .
he &apos;s already suffering .
and maybe trying to educate his dad is just making things worse .
well , sometimes it &apos;s my job
to educate the parents as well as the kids .
and he &apos;s practically the only friend that jude has .
yeah , which isn &apos;t great . jude needs more friends .
when have you ever backed down from a fight ?
let &apos;s say this was another kid at school .
what would you tell his parents ?
that if we didn &apos;t stand up to bullies and try to educate people
we wouldn &apos;t have civil rights and marriage equality .
ok . how &apos;s the new principal ?
more supportive than you .
i &apos;m in here !
i just need to grab some nail polish .
nice look .
take the nail polish and get out .
hmm , what do you think ? cherry red or mint green ?
i don &apos;t care . take them all .
seriously , what is with that towel ?
on my god ! moms are going to kill you !
not if you don &apos;t tell them .
oh , i &apos;m telling them .
no . no ! no ! no ! no ! no !
what do you want , huh ?
what do you want to keep your mouth shut ?
i know you want something .
hey . uh , come on in .
considering what &apos;s happened , i &apos;d like to be present .
it &apos;s fine .
i &apos;ll be in the other room .
ok , sit down .
you changed your hair .
oh , uh , yeah .
it nice .
so , stef , i want to thank you and lena
for allowing me to do this .
it was their choice .
well , thank you .
i don &apos;t really know exactly where to start .
i , um ...
i ... i made an inventory .
it &apos;s what they call it in aa .
it &apos;s basically just a list of all the terrible things i did to you
and ways i let you down when you were little and recently .
it &apos;s long .
it &apos;s too long .
i think what i ...
... what i really want to say ...
... what i &apos;m most ashamed of ...
... is that i loved getting high more than i loved you .
and it wasn &apos;t because you weren &apos;t lovable .
you were beautiful children
who just got a really raw deal with me as your mother .
i &apos;m just so grateful that god found you two great moms
who could love you and take care of you the way i should have .
what we do in these cases is to write a letter to the district
as well as the state department of education .
for students engaged in bullying . we &apos;re talking about a parent .
who is spreading rumors and participating in exclusion .
we don &apos;t know that he &apos;s told anyone but his son and ...
me , in your presence ...
that he believes jude is gay .
he didn &apos;t say &quot; believes . &quot; he said &quot; is . &quot;
he also said he doesn &apos;t have a problem with it .
he won &apos;t allow his son to share a tent with jude
during a school supervised trip .
but they weren &apos;t supervised , in the tent .
what are you suggesting ?
i &apos;m not suggesting anything .
none of the boys or girls were supervised in their tents .
and jude has not said he &apos;s gay .
and no one has the right to label anyone .
i agree . and we don &apos;t have the right to label the parent as a bully
because he has rules about who he allows his son to socialize with
and under what conditions .
i disagree .
as a parent you have that right .
but as vice principal of this school it &apos;s a conflict of interest
for you to use your position to retaliate .
retaliate ?
that &apos;s how it could be construed .
and we can &apos;t afford to get sued .
how about i just use my position as a parent then ?
you should have asked me what happened .
i did . you wouldn &apos;t talk about it .
i didn &apos;t want to tell you that my dad still ...
... spanks me .
i &apos;m sorry .
i just ...
i know what it &apos;s like to get hit
and feel like you can &apos;t tell anyone .
you didn &apos;t tell your mom what we did ?
did you ?
no .
so is there anything you want to say to me ?
it &apos;s ok , you can tell me how you feel .
you can be honest .
mariana ?
i know you , i know you must have something you want to say to me .
you don &apos;t know me . you don &apos;t know anything about me .
you want me to be honest ? i feel nothing .
i look at you and you &apos;re nothing .
you &apos;re just a very sad stranger .
i &apos;m done . i &apos;ll wait outside .
don &apos;t cry .
she didn &apos;t mean to hurt your feelings .
don &apos;t do that .
what ?
don &apos;t try to take care of me . you always used to do that .
no matter how long i left you alone ,
to go get high ...
mariana , she would always get angry with me but you ...
you would never stay mad at me ,
&apos;cause i &apos;d cry
and you &apos;d try to make me feel better .
that was not your job then and it &apos;s not your job now .
you ok ?
you told me dna doesn &apos;t make a family .
it doesn &apos;t .
then why did you want a baby ?
i ... i wanted ...
a real daughter .
honey , you are my real daughter .
but i &apos;ll always be adopted .
and ana will always be my birth mother .
i hate that i come from her .
why couldn &apos;t i come from you ?
oh , my baby .
i wish with all my heart that i could have carried you inside me .
sometimes i ...
... i feel guilty that i wasn &apos;t
there for you from the moment you were born .
but i realized something
when i lost frankie ?
was that you only carry a baby in your belly for nine months .
but you carry your child in your heart forever .
that &apos;s the only place that it counts .
you do come from me .
and from mom .
and giving birth to you ,
that wouldn &apos;t have made me love you any more than i do .
are you sure ?
would it make you love me more ?
no . that &apos;s crazy .
ok .
so , how about we both stop acting crazy , huh ?
come here .
i love you .
i love you .
will you help me with something tomorrow ?
anything .
hi . how is she ?
she &apos;s fine .
how are you ?
i quit my job today .
* you mean absolutely nothing to me *
* you are just like the boys before and yet they will be more *
* your heart stops but i am a super nova *
* take in , break in and burn in up the galaxy *
you &apos;re an ass .
i re @-@ wrote it so , you know , you could relate to it .
and this is who you think i am ?
it &apos;s kinda how you advertise .
did mat tell you i have a history of screwing guys in the band ?
he just said to be careful .
because i &apos;m a cold @-@ hearted bitch .
because i don &apos;t believe in prince charming or happily ever after
or &quot; i can &apos;t live without you . &quot;
i think ...
you know what mat didn &apos;t mention
was that one of those guys turned out to be a coke head
and the other one was a crazy jealous freak .
he just doesn &apos;t want anything to happen .
well , neither do you . so what &apos;s the issue ?
i really like sia .
and fall in an apple , like llewyn davis
do you listen to them ?
yeah , kinda . they &apos;re sort of depressing .
i like music that &apos;s about something .
is brandon &apos;s band good ?
yeah , they &apos;re awesome .
so , like the guy you told me about , before wyatt ,
the one you loved , was it brandon ?
why do you say that ?
your eyes light up when you talk about him .
well , that &apos;s because he &apos;s my best friend .
and my brother , soon .
you know , robert signed the papers ?
what about wyatt ?
i don &apos;t know about wyatt right now .
did you guys break up ?
i &apos;m not sure .
why do you call our dad robert ?
i guess , because donald is my dad .
is it true ?
he killed your mom in a car accident ?
well , he was driving .
and he went to jail ?
he was drinking , so , yeah . but he &apos;s out now .
so why aren &apos;t you and jude with him ?
you know , he &apos;s just ... he can &apos;t take care of us .
our dad can take care of you .
i &apos;m getting adopted by lena and stef .
will we still be friends ?
of course , yeah .
we &apos;ll always be sisters .
we should probably get some sleep .
you should probably know , the guest room ,
it &apos;s haunted .
i &apos;m kidding .
but if you want , you can sleep in here .
ok .
but sometimes , i wake up and see this woman
standing at the end of my bed .
stop it !
where did you get these ?
rita told me about the pictures you took
of some of the girls , that helped them get foster families .
and , you know , these are really great photos .
you &apos;re talented .
thank you .
and for doing this . it means a lot .
hello ?
oh , wow , this is beautiful .
oh , my gosh , it &apos;s only been one night , but we missed you .
i missed you , too .
oh , my gosh , your hair is back .
well , it was never really gone .
no , i missed brunette mariana .
yeah , i did too .
you just wanted to be the only blonde in the house .
you watch it .
so , rita and the girls are downstairs
by the pool where everything &apos;s kind of happening .
they have a pool ? can i live here ?
hey hey , what &apos;s so important ?
hayley &apos;s sort of freaking out .
oh . why ?
she wanted me to blow this off today to take care of her .
i gotta take care of myself sometimes , you know ?
yeah , i do know .
it was so good to meet you .
i wouldn &apos;t mind living here .
we &apos;ll be lucky to still
live where we do now that you quit your job .
you must be lena . i &apos;m jill .
hi . it &apos;s nice to finally meet you both .
i &apos;m robert . thanks for coming .
well , thank you for what you &apos;re doing for callie and for girls united .
it &apos;s our pleasure .
and , uh , thank you , for signing the papers .
of course . i just want callie to be happy .
well , we love her very much .
yes , i can see that .
how soon do you think before you can adopt her ?
well , we have to get a court date , but a couple weeks , probably .
well , it looks like most everyone &apos;s here .
yes , uh , let &apos;s get this party started .
let &apos;s do it .
could i have everyone &apos;s attention , please ?
thank you all for coming , on such short notice .
i guess now we know who our real friends are .
jill and i , we recently
heard about girls united through a friend .
and we were very impressed
by what this group home does for at @-@ risk girls ,
providing a safe and ...
you know , you look a lot like a girl i know .
really ?
unfortunately , they had
a fire recently and they lost their house .
and that &apos;s really why we &apos;re here today , it &apos;s to help raise money
so that they can get a new home .
she &apos;s a blonde .
who is ?
the girl you look like .
is she pretty ?
not as pretty as you .
but i &apos;ve always been into brunettes .
... enjoy someone &apos;s little sister .
one , two , three ...
they &apos;re really good .
yeah .
listen , thanks , for all this ,
for what you did for , well , for not only girls united
but for having my back , for not letting me give up .
it &apos;s really robert we should thank .
but i know it wasn &apos;t easy for you , to ask him to do this .
oh , he signed the papers . so i can get adopted .
that &apos;s great .
and he &apos;s not making me sign the , uh ,
liability waiver , whatever .
right , yeah .
so he said that he trusts that i don &apos;t want anything from him .
and why ? why don &apos;t you want anything from him ?
like money ?
no .
like a relationship .
i mean , it &apos;s quite obvious , callie , he loves you .
he barely knows me .
oh , now come on .
it doesn &apos;t take very long to love you , callie .
you &apos;re pretty amazing , you are .
you &apos;re kind , you &apos;ve got a compassionate heart .
and besides , you &apos;re his daughter .
so .
so he never had the chance to be a father to you and ,
i mean , it &apos;s pretty clear that he wants to be .
if you &apos;ll let him .
i just ... i really can &apos;t figure out why you wouldn &apos;t .
i &apos;m just saying that maybe it &apos;s
not too late to get back the job you have and love .
and what about jude ? who fights for him ?
i do . it &apos;s not a conflict of interest for me to write a letter .
frankly , i think that there &apos;s some grey area here , lena .
so you agree with monte ?
i &apos;m not saying that ...
hey . i didn &apos;t know you were coming .
yeah , i wanted to make a donation .
oh , that &apos;s nice .
you should check out the silent auction .
yeah ?
but don &apos;t you dare outbid me on that trip to puerto rico .
like that &apos;s gonna happen .
excuse me . i need something to drink .
so , how are the kids ? after meeting with ana ?
they &apos;re ok . they &apos;re ok .
at the moment , i &apos;m a little bit more concerned about my wife .
why ? what &apos;s going on ?
she quit her job .
what ? why ?
not for the reason that she thinks .
in my opinion , i think she lost the principal job and the baby .
and she wants control over something and sometimes ...
the only control you have is to quit .
thank you . thanks for listening .
uh , we &apos;re gonna go ahead and turn it over to the people
you really came to hear from . callie ?
hi . my name &apos;s callie .
and i ... i was at girls united .
at first , i didn &apos;t think i belonged there , no one does .
but rita , the amazing woman that runs the whole thing ,
she ... she doesn &apos;t let
you get away with your ... bad word deleted .
not because she &apos;s a hard ass , which she is ,
but because she cares .
she really cares about every girl that walks through her door .
and it &apos;s because of her and the other girls
and my wonderful brother and foster family ,
that i finally believed i could have faith in my future .
rita , you are the heart and soul of girls united .
you work tirelessly for not much money
and not a lot of gratitude .
but thank you for not giving up .
you &apos;ve given me the courage
to embrace everything that i am .
and to not be afraid of accepting love .
so i want to acknowledge robert quinn ...
for not only being a really nice guy
but for being my father .
it &apos;s a long story .
we only really found out about each other recently .
but i &apos;m really grateful to have him in my life now .
so thank you , robert and thank you jill
and my sister , sophia
for being so kind to me .
and now , rita ?
hi , everyone , i &apos;m rita hendricks .
i met most of you at this amazing event .
i really don &apos;t know what to say .
we thought girls united was over but , i don &apos;t know ,
love can move mountains , make miracles
and maybe just get us a new house .
i &apos;ll never forget this night and , um ...
... we all thank you , very much .
come here .
ok . ok . what &apos;d you have to tell me ?
it &apos;s not too late !
what &apos;s not ?
for us to be a family .
sophia , i &apos;m getting adopted by the fosters .
dad didn &apos;t sign the papers .
i mean , he did but they didn &apos;t actually ever get sent
because i took them out of the mail and i ripped them up .
so are you ok ?
that callie acknowledged robert and sophia ?
yeah . are you ?
i think so .
yeah .
did you quit your job because of me ?
how did you know about that ?
i overheard . sorry .
is it my fault ?
no .
no .
no , i quit my job because someone has to stand up to bullying .
i &apos;m your mom first , and i care more
about defending you than i do about keeping my job .
you shouldn &apos;t , defend me .
why not ?
because we did do something on the camping trip that was ...
... wrong , i guess .
dad , please listen , ok , i just thought
if she had more time that she would see we &apos;re a family .
the fosters are my family .
you just told everyone we are .
sophia , let me talk to callie alone , ok ?
i &apos;m trying not to be mad at her .
i think she &apos;s just ...
gotten attached to you .
yeah , we all have .
so how long do you think until you can get new copies ?
i can &apos;t .
i can &apos;t sign the papers , again .
signing them the first time ,
was the hardest thing that i have ever done .
and after hearing you today , say that ... i &apos;m your father ...
i can &apos;t abandon you . i know it &apos;s what you want .
i love you .
i don &apos;t love you .
and i will never live in this house with you .
and i will never call you my father again .
wait , callie ...
no , you promised me !
i know . i do , i want you to be happy .
i won &apos;t be happy . i &apos;m never going to be happy .
i &apos;m so sorry , ok ? i just want you to be with us .
i &apos;m your sister .
no , you &apos;re not . you &apos;re a spoiled little brat .
hey , callie ? what &apos;s going on ?
robert &apos;s not letting me get adopted .
i thought he signed the papers ?
i can &apos;t believe how stupid i am .
i knew i couldn &apos;t trust him . i can &apos;t trust anything .
and i knew this was gonna happen , brandon , i knew it .
come here , come here , sit down with me .
take some breaths . ok , just take some deep breaths .
no matter what , they can &apos;t make you live with them .
we &apos;ll still be your family .
i &apos;m never getting adopted .
you don &apos;t know that .
yes i do .
if robert doesn &apos;t sign the papers .
maybe this is the way it &apos;s supposed to be ,
maybe this is the way it was always supposed to be .
i gave up so much to be adopted .
