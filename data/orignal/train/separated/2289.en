第十二集
What must I do to enact this curse?
You need to sacrifice the heart of the thing you love most.
I'm sorry.
This isn't fair to Killian.
Gold tricked him. I'm getting him back.
You're going to Hell?
The Underworld.
Hook, I will find you.
I will always find you.
Hey, Emma.
Neal?
Yeah.
It's really great to see you.
Where are we? Am I dreaming?
No.
If this were a dream, there'd be, like,
talking doughnuts or something weird like that.
Think of this as a long-distance call from an old friend.
It's really you.
How's our son?
Great. He...
misses his dad.
He's growing up.
I bet.
Is this the Underworld?
I was on my way to the Underworld.
Yeah, I know that's where you're headed.
That's kind of why I'm here.
Don't go, Emma.
Once you get there, it is not an easy place to get out of.
I know you're trying to save Hook.
But trust me on this.
This won't end the way you think it will.
I would have come after you, too.
I didn't know I could do this.
You couldn't have.
I'm not there. I'm not in limbo.
Does that mean...
that Hook is there?
I can get him?
Yeah, he's there.
Then help me.
I can split my heart and give it to him.
It could work.
The Underworld's for people with unfinished business,
and that isn't me.
That's why I'm not there.
Where are you?
Someplace.
Someplace where I'm happy.
I only came here because I care about you, Emma.
Stop what you're doing before it's too late.
I can't.
I figured.
But I had to try.
Neal.
I love you, Emma.
I always have, and I always will.
Neal?
Emma.
Are you okay?
Yeah, you passed out.
Yeah. I'm fine.
Good. Because we're here.
I don't think we're in Maine anymore.
How is this possible?
How does the Underworld look like Storybrooke?
Your questions are pointless.
All that matters is, all these people in this Underworld
are dead and trapped
because they have unfinished business.
Cruella.
That's right.
And she's here because of you.
And I imagine there are many here because of all of us.
Let's not lollygag.
Split up. We'll cover more ground.
Agreed.
The sooner we get out of here, the better.
Greetings, my subjects.
Your Majesty.
Happy birthday, my Queen.
Blueberry.
Not bad.
But I prefer apple.
Luckily for you, I'm not here for the pie.
The present I want, none of you have.
But you will get it for me --
Snow White's heart on a plate.
I know she's been here.
And if someone doesn't start talking...
Wait.
I think I can help you.
I can tell you where Snow White is.
Then tell me.
I want something in return.
How's this for a deal?
Tell me, and I'll kill you quickly
instead of slowly.
Tell me where that wretched girl is.
Behind you.
I'm right here, Regina, and I won't let you hurt anyone else.
I wouldn't do that if I were you.
We've got you surrounded.
So, what do you say?
Shall we end this ridiculous conflict?
You're lucky it's my birthday
and I'm feeling benevolent.
Is this really the way you want to spend today?
Perhaps it's time for a change.
Perhaps it's time to
give up on revenge and move on.
I will never give up.
Not until Snow White's heart
is in one of these boxes.
I know you loved Daniel,
but if anyone is to blame, it's your mother.
She ripped out his heart
so you would become the merciless queen
that she always wanted.
Don't let her win.
Don't let her control you.
Mother does not control me.
I banished her to Wonderland, remember?
Until you give up this quest for vengeance,
Cora will always have a hold on you.
Your Majesty.
She's here.
Thank you for bringing me this information.
Now tell me -- How's my daughter?
Is that -- I know you.
Aren't you Snow White?
Can you imagine?
Uh, well, what can I get you?
Do you like gingerbread or children?
Kidding.
But the -- the gingerbread's actually not bad.
I'm looking for a friend.
He would have gotten here recently.
Uh, dark hair, a hook for a hand.
Captain Hook.
You know him?
No, no.
But your description's pretty complete.
David.
You changed. What happened? Is everything okay?
Everything's fine.
Good, because I'm not.
This place is creeping me out.
I see why my brother likes you.
James.
Indeed.
So, Snow White's in town.
I'm guessing that means my brother is, too.
All right.
When you see ol' Dave,
tell him there's a new sheriff in town.
Was that...my brother?
Yeah.
Mom. Dad.
You find anything?
There's no sign of him at the park or the town hall.
This is hopeless.
We don't even know if Hook's here.
What if he has no unfinished business?
He died a Dark One, Miss Swan.
Trust me, he's here.
Look, I'm finished being a team player.
If you want things done, let me do them my way.
I may have something down here that can help us.
Henry.
No luck yet, Mom?
Not yet.
What's that?
I was just checking the rooms.
Room eight.
That was your dad's.
You're looking for him?
I wanted to let him know I was okay.
He knows, kid. He knows.
How can you be sure?
I just am.
He's in a better place, I promise.
It's uncanny.
It's so similar, yet so...off.
Well, when I conjured Storybrooke,
it was with the Dark Curse.
Whoever created that curse,
looks like this is where they got their inspiration.
Or vice versa.
What is it? What's wrong?
You.
You've been following us.
Why?
Someone wants to see you.
I hate her pasty complexion...
her insufferable sincerity...
and her puny army of sweaty little child-beasts.
I believe they're dwarfs.
I don't care what they are. They're disgusting.
And I asked to be alone, Daddy.
So if you've come here to talk about Mother again,
I'm not interested.
I just want this birthday to be over.
Mirror, Mirror on the wall,
we must do something about my daughter.
How can I be of service?
I need you to summon...
...her.
I'm sorry. No.
I don't have a death wish.
If you care for my daughter at all, you will do what I ask.
As you wish.
Hello, Henry.
Cora, are aware of what day it is?
Of course. I'm well aware it's our daughter's birthday.
Let me guess -- She's wasting it
tormenting herself over Snow White.
You have to talk to her.
She listens to you.
Tell her to let go of this feud.
She doesn't need to let it go.
She needs to finish it.
If Regina won't be happy
until she crushes Snow White's heart,
then we must help her do just that.
This was a terrible idea.
Where do you think you're going?
To talk to Snow White.
Goodbye, Cora.
I don't need your help.
No.
But Regina does.
Mother.
You're here.
Yes.
I had hoped you were okay.
I know, darling.
I know.
But I do have unfinished business.
And that would be you.
You don't have to worry about me.
I'll always worry about you.
I want you to be happy.
Then help me find Hook and get out of here.
It's too dangerous.
You need to leave -- now.
I promised my friends I would help.
Your friends.
Your family.
They're what's holding you back.
Sweetheart, you must do what's best for you.
I am.
No, you're not.
And if you won't, I'll see to it that you do.
It wasn't easy,
but I've arranged for a boat to take you home.
It departs in one hour.
Take Henry, take your thief,
and go before it's too late.
Mother...
I can't.
You must.
I know it's hard to -- to put aside all suspicion
after how I raised you, but, Regina...
do you remember the last thing I said to you
before I died?
That I would have been enough.
You would have been.
It just took me too long to realize it.
Don't make the same mistake.
Go.
What would happened if I stayed?
Sometimes a mother has to do what's best for her child,
even if it's reprehensible.
Are you threatening me?
Oh, no.
No, of course not. I never.
But there's something I have to show you.
Mother...
where are we?
What are you doing?
Showing you your fate if you don't return to Storybrooke.
You...
You killed him.
"Killed" is, um, a relative term down here.
This Underworld...
most can only leave it in two ways --
to a better place or a worse one.
But you, my sweet daughter, have another option.
However, not for long.
Go home, or there will be a cost.
Someone will suffer.
Who?
Your father.
The Underworld?
I'll only be gone for a day.
Just long enough to retrieve Hook.
I-I don't understand. Why you?
Because, Belle, I'm the only who's been there.
Plus, my blood can summon the ferry.
Just come back to me.
I always do.
Looking for something?
Peter Pan.
I certainly wasn't looking for you.
Oh, come on, son. Don't be like that.
Aren't you glad to see your dear old father?
Just because you, uh, sired me,
that doesn't make you my father.
Step aside.
Keep looking for as long as you like.
But down here, this is my shop.
And you won't find anything unless I want you to.
Be careful with your threats.
Or what? You'll kill me again?
Maybe it's time to put the past behind us.
This is what you're looking for, right?
Go on.
Take it.
How generous.
How many strings are attached?
No strings.
Rumple, I meant what I said before I died.
I -- I do want to start over.
Never gonna happen.
I sent you here for a reason.
I miss the world above -- the tastes, the smells.
Sorry.
You can't go back.
Not unless I trade places with a living soul.
And those people you came down with...
they are not your friends.
And they are living...
for now.
Maybe one of them doesn't make the trip back,
but your dear old dad does.
Not interested.
Not yet.
But...
this one's on the house for today.
A gesture of goodwill...
from a father to his son.
She'll really do that?
She'll throw your father, her husband, into the fire?
Of course she will.
She thinks she's giving me my best chance.
I can't let my father suffer because of me.
Regina, it's all right.
No, it's not.
He's here because I killed him.
The only way I've been able to deal with that
is by imaging he went to a better place, but...
he didn't.
Maybe I should get on that boat.
Yes, you should.
Absolutely not.
We're not leaving until we find Hook together.
It's dangerous here.
Which is why we're not leaving you alone.
Perhaps I can cut through this little family squabble.
What the hell is that?
This is the way to find your deceased pirate.
The Ale of Seonaidh from the land of DunBroch.
That's a mouthful.
It lets you communicate with the dead.
Pour this over Hook's grave,
and we can stop guessing where he is and simply ask him.
You're saying Hook has a grave here in the Underworld?
Everyone down here has a grave.
You'll find the cemetery right where you remember it.
Well, if this works, we could find Hook before the boat leaves.
We could all get out of here together.
A fine idea. I suggest you all get moving.
No way.
You're coming with us.
You can do this part on your own.
There's a boat that's leaving soon.
You want to find Hook? Fine.
But I have no interest in exploring this world further.
You can meet me there.
But that's entirely up to you.
Emma.
There's no time to argue.
If there's even a chance that will work,
we have to risk it.
I got your message.
Are you alone?
Alone and unarmed, as promised.
Well, I'm alone, but I don't go anywhere unarmed.
Sorry.
I'm here because I care about my daughter.
And if the war continues, it will destroy the kingdom,
but more importantly, her soul.
Snow White.
You see?
The only way to truly achieve peace
is through war.
Cora.
How -- how are you here?
Why, because of you, Henry dear.
You played with magic you didn't understand.
And I never let a good mistake go to waste.
Please, I beg you.
Don't do this.
Now...
forget this ever happened
and go enjoy your last few hours.
Come along, Henry.
Regina needs her birthday present.
All right.
Let's do this.
You okay?
I just hope he is.
Killian.
Killian, we're here to help you.
We just can't find you. Where are you?
Emma...
the spell's not steady. He can't hear you.
Just tell us where you are.
Something's happening.
It's not holding.
Talk to us.
Talk to me.
Killian!
He doesn't know we came for him.
We -- he doesn't know we're here.
He doesn't know that I care.
Yes, he does. And, Emma, we will find him.
Will we?
Did you not just see that?
He's in pain. He's suffering.
And look at this place.
We have half an hour.
You have half an hour.
Cora has a boat coming.
You have to take it, or we might all be stuck here.
If she can arrange a way out, so can we --
after we find Hook.
We are not giving up on you.
Regina.
They're staying, but you should go.
No. I-I...
Take Robin and Henry...
because if you don't,
whatever your father is going to face --
it probably looks a lot like what...
Hook is facing.
So, it's settled.
Get them out of here.
Get yourself out of here.
Make a wish! Make a wish!
What did you wish?
That you were amusing, jester.
And it didn't come true.
Let's wind this up.
I've had enough revelry.
Oh, don't go yet.
Mother.
How did you get out of wonderland?
Where's Daddy?
Did you do something?
Oh, I lost track of him hours ago
when I had him wrap...
this.
Happy birthday, darling.
I don't want anything from you.
Oh, you'll want this.
I did what no one else could do, Regina.
I've brought you your revenge.
Snow White's beating heart.
Really?
Crush it,
and she dies at last.
You don't believe me.
Let me show you.
Bring the magic mirror.
Show us Snow White.
To my stepmother!
May she spend the rest of her birthdays searching for me.
To the queen!
To the queen!
To the queen!
Snow.
Someone switched the hearts.
Who?
You gave Snow White her heart back.
I had to for your own good.
How could you say that?
She'd be dead right now, and all this would be over.
Don't you want me to be happy?
Of course, but not like this.
If you crush her heart,
you could be dark forever, Regina.
You'll be just like her -- your mother.
That's what she wants.
Please. Please, Regina.
Please, you have to listen to me. You can be happy.
Killing Snow White
is the only way I will ever be happy.
I'm sorry you think that.
You betrayed me, daddy.
And you know what that means.
Do what you will, dear.
It matters not, because Snow White lives.
And now so does your chance at redemption.
Whatever happens to me was worth it.
This box is as empty as your pursuit.
I pray it stays that way.
It won't.
Until Snow White dies,
I will never be what you want...
let along what I want.
And this box
was made to hold something precious.
And that's exactly what's it's going to do.
Don't worry, daddy.
You're safe in here.
I just can't let you stop me.
But I would never do anything to hurt you.
Regina, please.
Don't.
No!
Regina.
Daddy.
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
It's okay, dear. It's okay.
It's okay. It's okay.
Is it?
Am I really forgiven?
Of course.
I love you no matter what.
That's what fathers do.
I'm not sure they do.
I think you're very special.
I don't understand how you can be so good.
Oh, I'm not perfect.
I have many regrets.
I don't even know which one is keeping me in this place.
Well, it doesn't matter.
Your suffering will not get any worse.
I'm going to see to it.
No, Regina.
That's I came to tell you.
Your mother is using me to get you to leave.
But I want you to stay.
You've got a job to do --
helping Snow White, your friends.
They need you. They need your strength.
You finally put vengeance aside to be a hero.
I'm not gonna stand in the way of that.
But mother's going to send you someplace worse.
I-I-I can't cause you pain again.
Mother made her decision.
We both know we can't change her mind.
But she's given you a way out.
Both of us.
When you tore my heart out,
it was driven by the worst motives.
But if you stay, you spread hope.
That's the best thing anyone can do.
Let your old man see you doing the right thing.
Then I truly will not have died in vain.
Where's your father run off to?
I still owe him a thank you
for spoiling your birthday surprise.
I've already dealt with him.
Say hello to daddy.
You've impressed me, sweetheart.
You know...
daddy may have been wrong to ruin my revenge,
but he was right about you.
When are you going to get it in that thick head
that I do everything for you?
Especially the things you can't do...
like Snow's heart.
How long have you been trying to get it?
Because it only took me a day.
And it only took you an hour to lose it.
When I get my revenge, it will be my victory.
You won't be around to steal it away.
You don't have the power to push me back to wonderland.
I don't need it.
There's someone who'd be happy to lend a hand.
Hello again, Cora.
Ready for your trip?
Don't do this!
It's done.
I've already cast a spell
to seal this portal once you're through.
Not even I can reopen it.
And you'll be out of my life forever.
Without me, you'll fail.
And even worse, you'll be alone.
Better alone than with you.
You think you're better alone?
Let's see how you really feel.
No!
Daddy!
you always have me.
Let him go, mother.
You should be on that boat.
I can't turn my back on those I love.
I know that seems like the right choice,
but life doesn't work that way.
I implore you, leave this place.
No, Regina. Stay here.
Help your friends. She's trying to bait you.
I didn't come back just to help my friends.
I came back to help everyone.
That's not possible.
You have to trust me.
Let him go.
Oh, please listen to reason. Listen to me.
Either way, my time in the Underworld is done.
Yours can be, too.
Just do what I say.
Henry, stand back.
Please don't force my hand. I don't want to do this.
Then don't.
I'm sorry.
No!
One day, you'll understand.
Daddy!
I'm so sorry.
Daddy?
Stop. Stay there.
I'm okay.
What's happening?
I don't know.
There's...
something down here.
It's so...
It's beautiful.
It's where I belong.
I know what my unfinished business was now.
It was you.
Me?
For so long, I let your mother
get in the way of who you really are.
It was the biggest regret of my life.
But now...
you're free of her.
And I've never been more proud.
Hi.
Is that...
This is your grandson --
Henry.
Thank you, grandpa...
for believing in her like I do.
Thank you, Henry...
for being there when I couldn't.
You take good care of her.
It's time for me to go.
Daddy, no.
I love you, Regina.
Never forget...
who you really are.
Okay.
Tell me your father's okay.
He's better than okay.
He's in a better place now.
Wait. That means everyone here...
can be saved.
Every soul in this town has unfinished business.
And chances are, for a lot of them, we're that business.
You've all deluded yourself
if you think these people are worth your time.
They're not the dearly departed.
They are dead, wretched souls,
and I want no part of it.
What you want doesn't matter.
I wasn't bluffing -- I'm happy to tell Belle
about your return to Dark One-ness.
Our agreement was to find your pirate
and get the hell out of here.
If you want to distract yourself
with this other asinine pursuit,
be my guest.
I'm out.
So...
who's ready for "Operation Firebird"?
Is that what we're calling it?
You referring to the mythological bird
or the muscle car?
Did you hear that, Cora?
The music?
Yes.
But I've never been very fond of the violin.
I wouldn't expect a miller's daughter
to appreciate a virtuoso like Paganini,
but, no, I didn't mean the music.
I was talking about the clock.
Did you hear that little tick up there?
It was the sound of your incompetence.
Why do you want my daughter gone?
What threat could she pose to you?
Ah. Tick, tick, tick.
You see, each clock tick
means a soul has left my domain.
Do I look like I like to lose anything?
I did what you asked.
I didn't want to. I...
I jeopardized my relationship with her.
Yes, because you thought
you could get her to do what I wanted,
which you couldn't.
If it makes you feel any better
she's going to regret her decision.
Don't threaten her.
Or me.
Now...
I want what I was promised.
Ah. Really, Cora.
I'm surprised you care so much about Regina...
especially after what you did to your other daughter.
How do you know about Zelena?
Oh, I know about everything.
Including why you gave her up.
All so you could claw your way out of a miserable peasant life.
Which suggests the perfect punishment.
Look at that.
A miller's daughter once again.
Hurry now, Cora.
You-- you have flour to deliver.
That's what they do at mills, isn't it?
I never paid much attention.
It seems like such dull work.
No.
No, you... promised you'd save us.
Just...
And you promised not to fail.
Something to think about for eternity.
