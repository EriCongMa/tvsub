This cream is a miracle.
My fine lines and sagging skin are gone.
I look like a different person.
Hey! Bro!
Thanks for the referral.
Painting the Smith house today.
Hey, it's me.
Heads up.
Someone's got eyes on us.
I need to come in.
Synalock. May I help you?
He's on a conference call, but he should be off in a few minutes.
Mr. Werner's not available. Can I have him return?
Thank you.
What?
You changed your hair.
No. Not really.
Hey. Just give me a second.
What do I have this morning?
Ok, move London to 12:30
And reschedule lunch with Caldwell.
So, what's going on?
I don't know. You tell me.
Don't shoot!
It's today?
I can't. I've got a big meeting.
Fine. Put her on.
Hi, sweetheart.
I know.
Ok. Well, mom's gonna record the pageant.
I know. I wish I could be there, too.
Ok. Break a leg, honey.
Hey, good morning.
Oh, look at you spoiling me. Thank you.
Where's yours?
Oh, I quit caffeine.
Trying to relax more.
Well, don't relax too much.
You got 10 hours of takedown
and arrest procedure training to recertify.
Since when?
Since the hearing.
Am I the only one?
Prentiss, you've been away.
Oh, yeah. I guess I can't complain.
Well, especially not to your trainer.
Oh! You're doing it?
Don't get too excited. I'm about to put you
through the wringer. You can believe that.
Workplace massacre this morning
At Synalock incorporated.
That's in Charlottesville,
which is practically our own backyard.
That's a high body count.
Yeah, 8 victims in total.
All employees, including the CEO.
5 were shot, 3 were stabbed to death.
A gun and a knife. That's highly unusual.
It could be two killers.
That would be the first time for a workplace killing.
Their business is internet security for corporations.
They didn't have video surveillance?
They just moved into a new building.
They didn't have time to set up their system yet.
How is it no one heard or saw anything?
This killer was prepared.
Highly organized. This was premeditated.
He kept his emotions contained.
Pretty hard to do for the typical workplace killer
who's mentally ill or outraged about some perceived injustice.
The high body count Indicates a hell of a lot of rage.
One employee, John Owen, was MIA.
Local P.D. Haven't been able to locate him yet.
Any unhappy clients?
Or a domestic situation among the employees?
Don't know, but your friendly neighborhood genius girl
Will find out.
Bottom line is a mass killing
is a classic show of force.
It's a way to become known.
Which is why suicide, often by cop, is usually part of the plan.
So where's the unsub?
He has a reason to stay hidden.
He's not finished yet.
"Men are not prisoners of fate,
But prisoners of their own minds."
Franklin D. Roosevelt.
Agent Hotchner? I'm trooper long
From the Bureau of Crime Investigation.
Appreciate you coming so quickly.
Absolutely. These are agents Rossi and Jareau and dr. Reid.
So a Fed Ex carrier called it in?
At 8:03, on his early route.
No one expect to go to work and never come home,
But today at Synalock,
A new company providing internet security...
After the news broke, half the town called in sick.
Understandable.
The media's in a frenzy.
A press briefing from you guys would calm them down.
Of course. As soon as we make our assessment.
So what do we know about the missing employee so far?
Apparently he's a programmer.
We have an unconfirmed report
of a neighbor seeing his car near his home this morning.
You said the CEO's office was ransacked?
Yes. Adam Werner's office.
JJ.
This is the first victim we found,
Nathan Munz.
The position of the body suggests
He was one of the last ones killed.
He tried to escape and almost made it to the exit.
Jane Burney and Winia Dev were here.
Jane tried to run, Vinia didn't.
How do you know?
She's half under her desk,
Which means she tried to hide and the unsub found her.
So these 3 were stabbed and the rest were shot to death.
Have you considered two killers?
Yes, but the bloody footprints
all seem to come from the same pair of shoes.
Given the violence, if there were a second killer,
He'd be hard-pressed to get away without leaving tracks.
If there was only one unsub,
He used his gun first, emptied his magazine,
Didn't have a replacement, and resorted to using his knife.
He'd have to be physically fight or at least intimidating enough
to subdue so many people.
If this were highly premeditated,
He would have brought enough ammunition to kill everyone.
Unless he had a single target.
He killed the rest of them because they were witnesses.
We need to figure out who his first victim was.
These are contracts Synalock had.
What was the unsub looking for?
Maybe he was a client searching for his own contract
to hide any connection to Synalock after the murders.
Ah, everything's digital these days,
though. The hard copy's just a backup.
So the unsub's looking for an object, an old record,
Something not on a computer.
Huh. Rossi, check this out.
So, uh, Werner was worried enough about his safety to be armed.
And he didn't have time to go for his gun
or didn't perceive the threat to be immediate.
or keeping a gun around was out of force of habit.
He was a veteran.
A naval officer by the looks of it.
A decorated one at that.
He was awarded the navy cross in 2000.
Something else used to be here.
Another picture frame.
Blood splatter overlay patterns
Indicate victim number 3 was over here.
Victim number 2 right here.
And finally victim number one right here.
Adam Werner was killed first?
Looks that way.
Which means the unsub made
it all the way in here without alarming anyone.
He wasn't threatening.
That's why Werner didn't pull the gun we found in his office.
He could have been the missing employee.
He may have taken that photo from his office if he was in it.
Why would an employee
be interested in Synalock's contracts?
Maybe this is about one client.
He could be after specific company information.
He had another motive besides killing.
Hello.
Dad, it's me.
Hey, Luke. Your mother and I were just talking about you.
Dad, listen to me. Has anyone called you,
asked you any questions?
About what?
About me.
No. What's this about?
There's a situation.
What sort of situation?
I'll tell you about it when I see you.
In the meantime, don't answer your phone or your door, ok?
Why?
I'm on my way there now.
You've reached Jenna. Leave a message.
Hey, it's Luke.
Uh, look, I know you don't want to hear from me.
But something's come up and I need to know
That you and Ally are safe, ok?
Call me. Bye.
It was clean and fast.
He sliced through the left carotid and abdominal aorta,
Major arteries that would bleed out quickly.
Killed with an economy of motion.
Yes. And all 3 stab victims had similar wounds.
What about the shooting victims?
They all took two .45s to the chest,
Except for Adam Werner.
He took 4 body shots and one to the head,
Execution style.
Definite overkill.
Somebody was angry with the boss.
Somebody with hunting skills.
Or a law enforcement background?
Thank you.
Mom? Dad?
Hey, Luke.
There you are. Mother's upstairs.
She was worried that something happened.
It's good to see you, buddy.
Dad?
What have you done to my father?
What are you talking about? I'm right here.
I'm right here.
What's wrong?
Is this about the mission?
What mission?
What's wrong with you?
What have you done to my father?
Talk to me, little genie.
Well, since you know how to rub my lamp,
Your wish is my command.
I checked the Synalock client list,
And the defense intelligence agency is new to them,
So there really isn't anything to report,
And everyone else is crazy happy with their service.
No complaints logged online?
Zero. I'm talking every high-tech blog,
Every chat room, glowing accolades.
No one had anything contrary to say about Synalock.
Any employees have a history of domestic disturbances or stalkers?
Not that I'd violate privacy laws to check, she says,
But the answer is no.
So Synalock is clean.
Mm-hmm. As a whistle.
Which reminds me...
You know how to whistle, don't you?
You just put your lips together
and blow.
I love it when you talk old movies. Later, baby girl.
With all the overkill on Werner,
There's got to be a personal connection.
We've located John Owen, the missing employee.
He's been at a doctor who convention in San Diego since Saturday.
It was a scheduled vacation.
Lucky guy.
I'll say. That's supposed to be an awesome convention.
So if it wasn't someone connected to the workplace, Who is it?
You know, given the precision of the kills,
It could be someone with a military background.
Or a professional hired by a business competitor.
A hit man would just kill Werner.
Killing the entire office seems unprofessional.
Werner was a navy veteran.
He had D.I.A. Contracts. He had close ties to the military.
It could be someone from his past harboring an old grudge.
Trooper, issue a be on the lookout to law enforcement
for a physically fit male in his 30s to 40s, possibly a veteran.
He appears nonthreatening and blends in easily.
He's armed and extremely dangerous.
He most likely will kill again,
Either himself or others, very soon.
What do you know about Dorado Falls?
Nothing. Is this because of Jenna?
What did you do to Jenna?
Luke, please, stop this, I'm begging you,
Your mother, her heart is weak.
Whatever's wrong, we'll help you.
This is your last chance.
You tell me where Mark and Mary Dolan are.
I'm Mark Dolan. I'm your father.
For the love of god! Please, Luke,
We're your parents.
Luke...
Luke, please! For the love of god, please.
Please, Luke! I'm Mark Dolan! I'm your father!
For god's sake!
Are we sure the unsub is their son?
Luke dolan called Synalock early this morning.
Garcia confirmed it.
Know many 60-year-olds with a boom box?
Trying to mask the sound of the gunshots?
Could be. Or he was torturing them with sound.
Why were they bound and gagged in the closet?
Why not just kill them right away?
Maybe he was trying to get information from them.
About what?
Go ahead, Garcia, you're on speaker.
Ok, Luke Dolan was in the same navy unit
as our CEO Adam Werner. That would be the 212th.
They were both communication clerks at camp patriot in Kuwait.
I'm sending all this information to your emails now.
Any other family?
He has a wife, Jenna. They've been separated for years.
She lives in Bethesda with her 8-year-old daughter.
We need to bring her for protective custody and to interview her.
Send local P.D. And have our nearest unit meet them.
Done and done.
Ok, it looks like he served 13 years,
Honorable discharge in 2005.
And now a vp of a biotech company.
He was never a synalock employee.
So, what happened to this guy?
He was separated from his wife about a year ago,
But that's a bit far back to be a trigger.
Well, he's unstable.
He's on a rampage of some kind.
What if mentally he was reliving a combat situation?
It could be post-traumatic stress.
Everybody could look like an enemy.
Prentiss, this was a close-knit family.
Look at them. They couldn't have been more proud of their son.
How bad would his disorder have to be
to make him kill his own parents?
Post-traumatic stress disorder rarely turns people into killers,
But soldiers with PTSD
have been known to strangle their wives in bed
While having flashbacks or nightmares,
believing they're on the battlefield.
In 2005, an iraqi war vet assaulted two people in las vegas,
Believing them to be enemy combatants.
So Dolan's having a sustained flashback.
Pathological disassociation
is one of the markers of complex PTSD,
Although Dolan has been stateside for 6 years.
An escalation of the symptoms is possible,
But it would be rare for them to appear out of nowhere.
Well, he seems to have made a successful transition to civilian life.
Well, at least on paper it does.
We should find out if he's had any symptoms since he left the navy.
It could have been the catalyst for the separation.
I'll have Garcia check his records.
Hotch, Dolan's been going through this.
Look, old mementos and journals from his days in the service.
He didn't come here just to kill his parents.
He came to get something.
He's on some sort of mission.
The car's washed, spotless inside,
There's no paint separation or rust.
This accident was recent.
I agree.
The navy's in his blood.
He would never let that go without getting it fixed immediately.
It might have triggered his condition.
I'll have Garcia run the plates, check for any recent accidents.
So, Dolan left his sedan and didn't take the parents' car.
He was smart enough to know it'd be tracked.
He's either on foot or he's stolen another vehicle.
If he's capable of doing this,
he's rational and clear-thinking enough
to evade his perceived enemies.
So despite any mental incapacity,
He's still performing at a high level.
Just got word from the local PD at the wife and daughters' house.
Dolan's unpredictable when he's on a rampage.
We need to go wide. We need to get the profile to the press.
Luke Dolan is a navy veteran
We believe is suffering from PTSD.
A recent trauma may have triggered this.
He is experiencing pathological disassociation
And may believe he's in a combat situation.
What this means is, to him,
Everyone is a potential enemy.
Do not underestimate him.
Despite his mental state, he has extreme survival skills.
Right now, we believe he's within a 250-mile radius of Roanoke.
He is armed and extremely dangerous.
It is important that you do not approach this man.
He believes that he is on a mission,
And if threatened, he will kill.
So if you see him, stay away
And notify the authorities.
Sir. Sir!
All units, suspect is a navey veteran...
Sir, excuse me. Sir, I need you to stop right there.
14, WHAT'S YOUR STATUS?
This is 14, shutting down linley road now.
Sir, this road's closed. You'll have to turn around.
What's going on, officer?
Official police matter, sir.
One thing that's been bothering me
Is the first victim, Adam Werner,
was given the navy cross in 2000.
We weren't at war.
Exactly.
You have to show extreme sacrifice,
Risk life and limb to win the second-highest medal of valor.
So what did he do during peacetime to deserve it?
Sir, Garcia discovered part
of Dolan's military records were encrypted.
I just got the complete file from the pentagon.
He wasn't a clerk. He was a navy seal.
Let me guess. Adam Werner was, too.
Yeah. Werner was the seal team leader, Dolan was his number 2.
Their unit was part of JSOC.
They were involved in over 20 highly classified missions.
Which missions were in 2000?
Uh, only one.
Operation Dorado Falls.
See what you can find out about it.
Will do.
Definitely. That changes the profile.
How so?
Navy seals are screened carefully for vulnerability to PTSD.
They're resistant to it.
So why would a trained navy seal kill his commanding officer
And his own parents?
I don't know, but it's gonna be a lot harder to find him.
Very few people on this planet are capable of stopping him.
Luke Dolan just evaded a roadblock near his wife's house.
They searched the surrounding area. There's no sign of him.
Did you notice any recent changes in Luke's behavior?
I saw him Friday afternoon when he dropped Ally off. He was fine.
Did he ever mention Dorado Falls?
No. What is that?
A mission he was on.
He didn't share that part of his life with me.
Luke was always very good at compartmentalizing.
Is that why you two separated?
He's a good man and a wonderful father,
But I always felt he was more married to the navy than me.
You weren't a priority to him?
Somebody once told me all navy seals had a bolt hole,
A secret location outside the country
Where they had another identity and bank account set up.
And I asked Luke about it once and he didn't deny it.
The fact of the matter is, he was ready to leave in an instant.
He had an exit strategy.
Yeah. That didn't include us.
Is daddy gonna be ok?
Oh, honey, come here.
Ok, so it turns out 6:20 Friday night
Dolan got in a car accident in Bethesda.
That must have been after he dropped off his daughter.
He suffered minor injuries, he refused medical treatment.
Well, his wife said he was fine when he left her.
What was his mental state after the accident?
Normal. Field sobriety test came up negative.
That wouldn't rule out drug use.
I'd consider schizophrenia,
Except he's the wrong age for the first psychotic break.
It could be an aneurysm or a brain tumor.
Well, one thing's for sure. He's having a mental breakdown,
But what are the specific features of it?
He's not living in a past time and place,
he's living in the present,
With the capacity and intelligence to evade law enforcement.
Honey, grab me a soda, will you?
Honey, the movie's starting. You're missing Robert Mitchum.
You want her to live? Tell me where my family is.
He took my husband. Boyd was bleeding and he dragged him out.
Mrs. Milgram--
Is someone from the army helping?
Ma'am, listen to me. The
FBI is in charge of looking for your husband,
But I need you to try to remember what Luke Dolan said.
I can't. It was gibberish.
Yes, you can. Just close your eyes.
I can't.
Ma'am, I believe that you can.
Just listen to the sound of my voice and you'll be fine.
Just try. Close your eyes.
There you go.
Just relax and breathe.
Very good.
Now, what were you doing
Before he broke into your house?
I was in the kitchen. I was pouring a drink for my husband.
He takes me to the living room and ties me up.
What does he say?
Where are my real parents?
He asks where his real parents are.
How the hell should I know? I don't even know you.
Don't play dumb. You replaced them.
Does he think your husband did something to them?
He says, "You replaced them."
The replacements are dead.
Does he mention Dorado Falls?
Yes.
This is about Dorado Falls, isn't it?
And gaslighting.
Dorado Falls?
You're gaslighting me 'cause of the mission.
The mission? Who's your commanding officer?
You won't get away with this.
Where are you keeping Jenna and Ally?
Where's my family?
He was calm until he asked about his family.
Then he hits Boyd with the gun.
All of the Milgrams' cars are still here,
So he must have taken the general in whatever vehicle he came in.
He talked about gaslighting.
He thinks someone's trying to purposely distort his reality.
He said his parents had been replaced.
He just sounds delusional.
You know, he might have capgras syndrome.
It's a delusional disorder in
which one believes that their friends and loved ones
Have been replaced by imposters.
Sort of like "Invasion of the body snatchers."
It typically involves only one sense, such as sight.
Basically, the neural connection between the visual cortex
And the emotional center of the brain becomes severed,
So that looking at a loved one doesn't elicit
The same emotional response one would expect.
So you think they're an imposter.
And the interesting thing
is that the auditory connection remains intact,
So that if they were to hear a loved one speak and not see them,
They'd think that they were real.
What causes this syndrome?
It's unknown in 60% of the cases,
But the rest have an organic cause,
Such as tumor or head trauma.
He was in a car accident Friday.
People with delusional disorders
Don't all become killers, though.
True, but Dolan's background as a navy seal,
His knowledge of secret missions, plus capgras syndrome,
Could result in extreme paranoia. It's the perfect storm.
Is there a cure for this?
Unfortunately, no.
Although medications have helped in a few cases.
So this guy's stuck with it.
He's not killing for the thrill of it,
He does it because he believes he has no other choice.
He murdered his best friend and his parents
Because he believed they were imposters.
So if he were to see his wife and daughter,
The results would be deadly.
Dolan kidnapped the general and didn't kill his wife
Because he had never met them before.
There might be another reason.
He wants contact.
I don't know what you think you're gonna gain by your actions,
But I do know this-- you swore an oath to defend this country
And behave with moral rectitude.
Were you thinking of morals
when you gave the go-ahead on Dorado Falls?
I told you, that wasn't me.
You're a liar.
This country's at war, and Dorado Falls
is nothing but a speck on the radar.
No one even remembers.
I remember.
What are you gonna do with me?
I'll trade you for my wife and child.
And if that doesn't work?
I'll kill you.
You're not a navy seal, you're a disgrace--
国防情报局
How close are you to getting Dolan?
Our primary goal right now is the safe recovery of the general.
This is highly classified information, Agent Jareau.
Can't the BAU do this on their own?
We could. But your help would speed things up.
You're smart enough to see the upside, I'm sure.
You help and it goes well, you get your ticket punched.
You don't and it goes south, well,
the weather's not too bad outside the Beltway.
It's all in there.
You know why Dolan's so worried about this mission?
I have no idea.
Were there complications?
Every mission has complications.
But there's no blowback on this one, I can assure you of that.
Ok.
It just--I can't understand
why Luke would do all these awful things.
What's happening to him?
We think his car accident
Triggered a delusional disorder.
Oh, my god.
We need to know who Luke was closest to.
His father.
Hello.
Is this lieutenant Luke Dolan?
Who is this?
Sergeant Major David Rossi,
United states marine corps, retired.
Who told you to call me?
I volunteered to call you.
I knew your dad, Mark.
We were in boot camp together at Parris island.
He's a good man.
Still triangulating a location. Hold on.
Hold on.
Now, we can talk,
But first I need to know that general Milgram is safe.
He's alive, if that's what you mean.
What's up with the music?
I have no idea.
Why did you kidnap the general?
For leverage to get my family back.
Do you think we're holding them?
I saw you take my wife and child.
What have you got, Garcia?
Getting closer.
We're in the warehouse district. Stand by.
Please, stand by.
Got it! 3352 spring street.
Let's go.
Release the general and then we can talk about your family.
He's innocent.
So you think.
Luke, do you think your father would approve
of what you're doing?
I just want my family back.
Besides, I didn't start this.
Start what?
Dorado Falls.
Why don't you tell us your side of the story?
You first.
All right.
Dorado Falls was the name of a boat off the coast of Cape Town.
It was owned by a South African Diplomat
Who was selling nuclear secrets to Iran.
So what's the big secret?
There isn't one. Don't get me wrong,
Lives were lost, but there's been far worse missions.
His mind chose Dorado Falls to build a conspiracy around.
This can't be it.
Garcia, it's an empty lot with a cell phone repeater.
Give me a rundown on the buildings in the area
And the years that they were built.
All over it like cat hair on a sofa.
Btw, I can usually locate a cell phone within 3 meters,
But sometimes there are circumstances beyond my control,
Like physical barriers blocking a signal,
Not being in the satellite's direct line of sight,
Which bounces the signal to a repeater.
Garcia, tell me you've got something.
Oh, sorry. Yes, I have something.
There is a hotel built in '74 that is scheduled for demo,
And there is a warehouse scheduled
for loft conversion that was built in 1928.
All right, walls were thicker in the twenties.
What's the address of the building?
More GPS signal interference. Exact address is...
291 hope street.
291 hope.
Intel failed to identify... two children aboard the boat.
There was a chance to abort,
But we were given orders to go ahead.
Someone in the D.I.A. Made that final call.
I never knew it was Milgram until now.
Sometimes collateral damage can't be avoided.
You know, people that sit in offices always think that.
This is Red Echo. We have unwanted targets.
Permission to abort.
Negative, Red Echo. The operation is a go.
I repeat, the operation is a go.
You had to shoot those kids, didn't you?
They saw us. They would have blown the mission.
They were witnesses.
Just like everyone at Synalock.
Someone wants revenge.
We've always known that our own government
might disavow us.
They tried to buy adam with the Navy Cross, but it didn't work,
So they've replaced him with an imposter.
And now they're taking my family one by one.
Listen, Jenna and Ally are safe.
You expect me to believe that?
I know they're coming after me.
I'll make you an offer.
You let Milgram go and I'll take his place.
I don't want you, I want my family.
The people who have them
will not negotiate unless Milgram is freed.
But you need insurance. I get that.
Let me take his place.
Why would you do that?
Because I'm not just a guy behind a desk.
I was a marine with boots on the ground, just like you.
I know what you've been through.
I want you to get your family back.
All right.
Where's Hotch and Morgan?
The spring street address didn't pan out.
They're searching the warehouse right now.
Luke, I need your exact address.
All clear. Clear.
We got the general.
He's still alive.
Guys, get him out of here.
Now, where the hell is Dolan?
Yeah, he used the radio to mask the sound of his movements.
We're on the move.
This was all part of his plan
to find out who was holding his wife and daughter.
But you never said you were FBI.
He saw the number I called from.
He'd recognize an FBI prefix.
So, what, he's on his way here to Quantico?
I know the head space he's in.
He feels all alone right now.
There is no risk he won't take.
As a navy seal, he did training here. He knows this place.
All right, alert the guard gates and secure the building.
Entry and exit through one door only.
An FBI police officer was just found shot to death
In the academy parking structure.
He's already here.
Dolan's photo's already been sent on all internal servers.
He's probably changed his appearance already.
And he's got 13 floors to hide on.
We should make a general P.A. Announcement.
No. He believes he's on a rescue mission that he can pull off.
As long as he thinks that, he'll stay calm.
I've got hundreds of employees in here
And you want me to do nothing?
Nothing overt.
Have your teams quietly search and seal off each floor.
Garcia, I need you on the building's operations computer.
Ready and able, sir.
Dolan's got a police radio.
I want all alerts sent through a secure tactical channel.
I can talk to him. He won't hurt me.
We can't take that risk.
You'll be safe in here.
I don't see him.
He knows how to be invisible.
I got him. He used the dead officer's I.D.
to enter the 7th floor.
Seal it off. Nobody in or out.
Navy seals never start a mission without an exfiltration plan.
Check the exterior and elevator shafts for riggings.
Turning exterior cameras now.
A member of the seal team said Dolan's an expert in explosives,
Disabling and building them.
Also be on the lookout for explosives.
Hello?
Is this sergeant major Rossi?
Yes. I was hoping you'd call, Luke.
Where are you?
Right behind you.
Ok, ok easy, easy.
Oh, my god. Oh, my god.
All right. Luke,
You don't want to be aiming that around.
Snipers have the building covered.
You're in the crosshairs right now, I can guarantee that.
Windows are bulletproof.
High-density lexan, right?
I'm the one you want.
You can let my team go.
I'll trade you. Give me my wife and daughter.
You have 3 minutes to decide.
Is he for real? He'll blow us all up, himself included?
Start an evacuation.
Can we evacuate everyone in 3 minutes?
Prentiss, I need his wife in here.
No one is seeking revenge here.
You've created this conspiracy in your own mind.
You took my family.
To protect them from you after you murdered your own parents.
They were imposters. You have my real parents.
Your real parents are dead.
Spence--
You want to know what's really going on?
You were in a car accident 3 nights ago
And you suffered a head trauma.
If I don't see Jenna and Ally now...
We're all gonna die.
Luke?
Can you hear me?
I need you to stop what you're doing.
We're fine.
Me and Ally are safe.
Luke, you have to let those people go.
The terms haven't changed.
You don't believe that's her?
I've been through this before.
You have one minute.
Daddy? Why are you doing this?
Mommy says you don't feel good.
Maybe you need to lie down.
I'm scared, daddy.
I just want to go home.
Jenna, can you talk to him about something personal,
Something that only the two of you would know about?
Do you remember our honeymoon,
When you woke me up at night
And you took me up that mountain
That you'd hiked years before?
We watched the sun rise.
It was magical.
And you said
That as much as you loved this spot,
You loved me even more.
Do you believe it's her now?
Your eyes and your mind are playing a trick on you.
When you see your family, you think that they're imposters,
But it's all caused by an illness.
You're sick, luke. It's not your fault.
I love you, daddy.
We both do.
Come on, now, Luke,
You don't need that gun.
None of us want to hurt you. You are a hero to this country.
Please let us help you.
I want to see Jenna.
Then you have to do as I ask.
Put your weapon down
And close your eyes.
Luke, you have to close your eyes.
Why?
Because you need to know that your wife is real
And your eyes will trick you.
Please, Luke.
Close your eyes or we will never be together again.
Close your eyes.
Ok. They're afraid you might hurt me,
So they're gonna handcuff you.
And then I'm going to come out,
But you have to keep your eyes closed.
I'm right here, baby.
Promise me you'll keep your eyes closed.
Is that you?
Is that really you?
Everything's gonna be ok.
But we have to go to the hospital now, ok?
First Jenna's gonna cover up your eyes.
Daddy! Daddy, where are you going?
No! No! JJ, let me have him.
Daddy!
Get him out of here! No! No!
Get him out of here!
No!
No!

"We die alone.
"Only through our love and friendship

That we're not alone."
Orson Welles.
No, I didn't mandate it.
Uh, is everything all right? You ok?
Oh, yeah. I'm good.
It's all in a day's work, right?
I'll see you in the morning.
Good night.
Uh, Hotch didn't order my takedown recertification.
Do you want to tell me what's really going on?
I just thought we both could use a refresher.
You mean you thought I could use it.
You're nervous about me being back.
Emily...
What...you think I'm gonna mess up the team's rhythm.
I get it. But just come out and say it.
Morgan.
Ok, fine.
Yes, I am nervous.
But not about you.
About me.
Emily, I thought I lost you,
And I blamed myself.
Now, you're back, but I don't want to be worried
About losing you again and get distracted.
So you wanted some reassurance.
Yeah, something like that.
Morgan, I cannot imagine what you went through.
It was 7 months of hell.
How can I make it up to you?
I will do whatever it takes.
Just give me 10 hour of training.
Ok, you got it.
Shooting range on sundays.
I'm there.
And my morning coffee
And a neck rub every day.
