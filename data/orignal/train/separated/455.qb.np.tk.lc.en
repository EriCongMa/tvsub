perrenials
blessed are the leaves , the forest
the air that we breath ,
each day help me realize that the oneness that
nurtures , strengthens , and invigorates .
allow me to honor you each morning
as you honor all of your creatures .
accept these humble offerings , and give me the strength to ...
who are you ?
where did you come from ?
it &apos;s been a long time , petty .
i bet you didn &apos;t think i track you down .
my name isn &apos;t pe ...
what are you talking about ?
no , no .
wait ! what are you doing ?
lay down on your stomach .
please , i &apos;m only ...
your stomach .
don &apos;t do this .
i &apos;m just a humble servent ...
what is it you call yourself now ?
floressa ?
you ... you &apos;re making a mistake !
yes ! ok , i changed my name to floressa
when i came here , but before that i wasn &apos;t petty .
i was nina , i was nina skinner from ...
bite that . bite down . there .
i always wondered
what spencer reid &apos;s grocery list looked like .
it &apos;s actually rieman &apos;s hypothesis .
which is ?
it &apos;s a mathematical conjecture from the 19th century
that states that the riemann @-@ zeta function zeroes
all lie on the critical line .
yeah , i get it .
i noodle it from time to time .
it sort of helps me unwind , you know ?
well , since we &apos;re on the subject of unwinding ,
how &apos;d your date go ?
uh , had to cancel at the last minute .
oh ? you did or she did ?
um , sort of both did .
but ... it &apos;s fine . i talked to her this morning
and things are good .
round table &apos;s about to start . we should probably get going .
what have we got ?
nothing good . ok , anyone who &apos;s wandered through
a museum in italy knows that a chisel and a hammer
in the right hands can be a beautiful thing .
but michelangelo this is not , my friends .
ok , floressa , aka nina skinner ,
was found yesterday ,
murdered on the grounds of church of the first dawn , in alabama .
two days earlier , 100 miles away ,
charlie clayton was taken from his home
in gulfport , mississippi ,
he was brought to the woods , he was also murdered .
chisels to the brain .
and a lot of creepy @-@ crawlers .
forensics ?
mm @-@ mmm . neither crime scene yielded much results
because of too many bugs and critters .
the choice and placement of the chisel is very specific .
maybe the unsub symbolically is destroying
the thoughts and memories of the victims .
it looks like they were facedown
when the chisel went in . remorse ?
could be the killer knew the victims ,
didn &apos;t want to see their faces when he was killing them .
was their a connection between clayton and floressa ?
nothing &apos;s been found yet .
so right now , method of execution and regional proximity
are the only two things linking them .
it could be a spree killer on the move .
a spree killer who &apos;s careful and meticulous
and covers his tracks .
we &apos;ve got a mobile unsub with a significant head start .
we can &apos;t afford to be playing catch @-@ up .
wheels up in 30 .
i have never yet heard of a murderer
who was not afraid of a ghost .
john philpot curran .
these first two victims couldn &apos;t be more different .
ethnicity , gender , age , social and economic background .
both were born and raised in the deep south . but that &apos;s it .
garcia , you said that the last victim ,
floressa , changed her name ?
yeah . her name was nina skinner and she changed it
when she joined church of the first dawn 6 years ago .
what do we know about this church ?
is it a legitimate religion ?
ah , it &apos;s more like religious adjacent .
it appears to be a hodgepodge of a bunch of different
religious beliefs plucked from here and there .
and floressa lived on the grounds of the church ?
yes . she and 15 other women .
it sounds like a convent .
you know , it sort of is .
the residents had to take the same kinds of vows
as nuns--celibacy , poverty ,
days spent in quiet contemplation .
i would not be a good candidate for admission , in other words .
garcia , did the compound allow outsiders ?
not usually , but it appears that once or twice a year
they do let in non @-@ members for like a week @-@ long retreat .
are these non @-@ members men and women ?
apparently so .
garcia , compile a list of guests
for these retreats for the last year , please .
will do .
it says here that the first victim , charlie clayton ,
was a seventh day adventist .
could this be someone harboring a grudge against religion ?
or the opposite .
both victims gravitated toward non @-@ mainstream faiths .
this could be a zealot wanting to punish those
who deviate from strict orthodox beliefs .
blake , you and reid go see the medical examine .
morgan and rossi , drive to mississippi
and see what you can find out about the first victim .
jj and i will go to the compound and see where floressa was killed .
how long have you been head of the church ?
35 years .
i founded it .
and floressa joined 6 years ago ?
yes .
how much contact would she have had with the outside world ?
none . the women who are custodians of the faith
turn themselves over to it completely .
and the people you allow for the week @-@ long retreats ,
would floressa have interacted with them ?
no . guests are housed in a separate area .
we provide them a quiet space for contemplation .
did this man ever go to any of your retreats ?
no . i &apos;ve never seen him before .
this is where it happened .
i still can &apos;t believe it .
is there any sort of screening process before you accept a resident
studying the faith like floressa ?
i don &apos;t understand .
like a background check ?
the killer may have known her before she came here .
and if she &apos;d had a troubled past ,
she might have seen this as a refuge .
floressa was a woman of deep and sincere faith .
there was no need for us to investigate her previous life .
if a holy sanctuary isn &apos;t immune from
a horrible act like this , what is ?
uh , let me guess .
she don &apos;t know nothin &apos; about nothin &apos; .
practically a direct quote .
how did you know that ?
oh , it &apos;s a busy enough street .
broad daylight .
house is fully exposed .
either this unsub is really , really good ,
or this is the worst neighborhood watch program .
i already told the regular police i didn &apos;t see anything .
well , that &apos;s a shame .
oh , by the way ,
we couldn &apos;t help but notice all of these , uh , empty jars .
i find &apos; em in the garbage cans and turn &apos; em in for money .
sanitized ?
my third wife , she always said i was part bloodhound .
all of those jars , they smell of ... disinfectant .
i can vouch for the bloodhound part .
he sniffed out your mailbox .
converted whiskey jars hold their scent .
as do converted moonshine jugs .
only thing is , making moonshine is against the law ,
so maybe my friend &apos;s nose here is wrong this time .
well , a weird guy came over when i was out front
and started talking to me , that &apos;s all .
asked about charlie .
asking what ?
just wanted to make sure that is where he lived .
kept calling him taylor , though .
taylor ?
so maybe charlie wasn &apos;t who he was looking for .
oh , it was . this guy described charlie to a &quot; t. &quot;
the guy you talked to , you remember what he looked like ?
sure . heh . you might have the nose , but i got the eyes .
in my line of work , you &apos;d best not forget a face .
put on another shirt .
we &apos;re going for a ride .
chisel severed the brain stem .
clean , quick , right on the money .
death was instantaneous .
were there any drugs in her system ?
nope . tox screen was clean .
yet she seemed totally compliant .
to control her , the unsub must have been armed .
any evidence of torture or sexual abuse ?
none .
except for the chisel in her head ,
the victim was in tip @-@ top shape .
did find some wood residue in the teeth ,
back molars , both sides of the mouth .
killer might have somehow used the stick as a gag ?
it says here there was excessive insect infestation ?
sure was .
and the wrong kind and in the wrong place .
what do you mean ?
the victim was only dead a few hours .
there should have been adult flies and unhatched eggs , maybe .
certainly not third @-@ instar larvae .
and the maggots were all over the place .
flies don &apos;t lay their eggs around the food source ,
they squirt &apos; em out right there in the blood and guts .
and icing on the cake--
i found a composite of animal hair mixed in with the larvae--
turns out to be skunk .
were these inconsistencies present
in the first victim , the one from mississippi ?
don &apos;t know about the animal hair , but yeah .
gulfport m.e. found the exact same thing at his crime scene--
the mass insect infestation not consistent with
the early stage of decomposition .
this unsub is bringing fly larvae to the crime scene with him .
our unsub is skilled at avoiding detection .
a man in this environment would have stood out .
have garcia check for male maintenance workers , any city employees
that might have access to this part of the compound .
what have you got , morgan ?
hey , we found a neighbor who not only saw the unsub ,
but he spoke with him , too .
the day of the murder ?
yeah . unsub was trying to make sure of charlie clayton &apos;s address ,
but kept referring to the victim as taylor .
neighbor give enough of a description to get a sketch ?
yeah , i got it right here in my hands .
it &apos;s a damn good one , too .
i &apos;ll text it right over .
top that off for you ?
need a menu ?
no . but thanks for asking , carol .
you &apos;ve got the wrong gal .
i &apos;m brianna .
i don &apos;t think so .
recognize me yet ?
i made it easy for you .
so just coffee , then ?
the sign up there says i get a free dessert if it &apos;s my birthday .
uh @-@ huh . and today happens to be your birthday ?
yes , ma &apos;am .
well , i &apos;m gonna need some i.d. to verify that .
i have no reason to lie to you , carol .
especially about the day a person was born .
it &apos;s the most important day there is .
you of all people should realize that .
molly &apos;s not gonna like that you did that .
it shut the guy up , didn &apos;t it ?
seriously , how come all the weirdoes
always sit in my section instead of yours ?
oh , i don &apos;t know . maybe you have that special something .
yeah , right ?
next job i get is gonna be at a fire lookout station
way up in the mountains .
no dealing with the public at all .
a dead skunk ?
no . why ?
skunk hair was found in the larvae
at floressa &apos;s crime scene .
thought maybe there was one laying around nearby .
i would have sniffed it out had there been one .
here &apos;s the police sketch .
this guy &apos;s brazen .
chatting with the neighbor about the person he &apos;s on his way to murder .
he &apos;s too calm to be on a spree .
something else is motivating him .
ok , great . thanks .
two for two . gulfport m.e.
also found animal hair on the first victim &apos;s larvae--
raccoon--and charlie clayton
had wood residue in his teeth just like floressa .
russell smith .
who ?
a serial killer who was active in this part of the country
from 1967 to 1987 .
i remember .
smith was a sexual sadist who murdered 8 prostitutes
before being killed in a police shootout .
and he had his victims bite
down on a block of wood before he killed them .
good night , chris .
good night , brianna .
oh , my god .
bite down--hard .
a chisel rit in the skull .
20 years on the job , you think you &apos;ve seen it all .
the rest of the team should be here within the hour .
sheriff mitchell , agent rossi .
we &apos;re getting you folks set up over at the county sheriff &apos;s office .
thank you .
you the one that found her ?
yes , sir .
i was making my rounds about 4 : 00 in the morning .
i &apos;ve never seen anything like it .
the blood . bugs all over the place .
doors and windows open
when you discovered the body ?
no , sir . i checked .
found this in the car .
bite marks .
the co @-@ worker &apos;s ready for you .
yeah , that &apos;s him .
you know who he is ?
no , not yet .
there was a cut on his jaw , though .
he had a bandage ,
but it was bloody .
fresh blood , like it had just happened .
when he left , did he get into a car or ...
i didn &apos;t see him go .
i just thought he was like , you know ,
homeless guy or something ,
he wanted free food .
he asked for food ?
yeah . he said it was his birthday .
he got really weird and intense
when brianna asked him for his i.d.
how so ?
well , he went on and on about
how nobody would ever lie about the day they were born .
i mean , brianna gave him the pie anyway .
did this man at any point refer to brianna by another name ?
yeah . i completely forgot about that .
he called her carol .
ok .
well , we appreciate all your help , ms. carson .
if you can remember anything else ,
please , give us a call .
so the unsub recognizes his victims ,
but he calls them by a different name .
what &apos;s that about ?
the guy &apos;s schizophrenic , maybe .
no , the killings are too organized and methodical .
these people are probably surrogates .
garcia can &apos;t find any
late @-@ blooming russell smith wannabes out there .
at least nobody on law enforcement radar .
you know , using a stick as a gag maybe have simply
been a convenience at the first two crime scenes .
the unsub was in the forest and they were handy .
but he specifically brought a stick with him
to the most recent crime scene .
it &apos;s a ritual that mirrors russell smith &apos;s very closely .
also , there &apos;s something strange about the fly larvae
that was found in the car .
you mean besides the fact that there was fly larvae in the car .
well , that , and is was laid by lucilia mexicana flies .
meaning what ?
it &apos;s a species unique
to the southwestern united states
and the dry desert climates of latin america .
there &apos;s no way it would be found along the gulf coast
unless it was brought here .
i think i know what &apos;s going on .
enlighten us .
dna from the maggot stomach crop
at both crime scenes
revealed not only skunk and raccoon meat ,
but traces of engine oil .
i think this unsub is seeding his victims
with aged maggots reared on animal remains .
road kill .
can i help you ?
i &apos;m looking for ted .
sorry . you must have the wrong house .
kyle .
are you ok ?
you must be ted &apos;s wife .
oh , my god !
no . stop right there .
so far , the unsub &apos;s
not trying hard to hide anything from us .
what if december 11th actually is his birthday .
like he told the waitress ?
the unsub &apos;s in his mid @-@ to @-@ late 20s
it means he was born between 1987 and 1992 .
reid , get garcia on it .
tell her to narrow the search
to those with a criminal background
who live in the southwestern united states ,
someone with a history
of vandalizing churches or religious shrines
and someone who &apos;s also worked with
or is at least familiar with insects .
who are you ?
how do you know ted ?
you mean your husband ?
we &apos;ve known each other for years and years .
ten years .
how old are you ?
where is he ?
my husband is dead .
what ?
he died of--of cancer .
you &apos;re lying .
i &apos;m not .
i live here alone now .
i rent rooms to college students
to help with expenses .
i &apos;m going to give you one last chance to tell the truth .
and i mean it better be the truth .
when did he die ?
it was a long time ago .
i need to know exactly when .
1999 .
it was may 12 , 1999 .
morning or night ?
what ?
morning or night ?
night . it was night .
what difference does it make ?
where ? at home ?
no , at the hospital .
which one ?
tell me which hospital !
escambia memorial !
do you have any idea how many people are born on earth every day ?
358,197 approximately .
i did not like the answer to that question .
my point-- even if narrowed way , way down ,
none of these fit the profile of our unsub .
if december 11th really is his birthday ,
he &apos;s kept his nose clean so far .
the unsub told brianna that there was no more important day
in one &apos;s life than the day you were born .
it has to somehow be part of his methodology .
how about the birthdays of russell smith &apos;s earlier victims ,
the 8 prostitutes ?
you could be right . anniversary kills .
selecting victims who share the same birthdays as those who went before .
what is it , hotch ?
the new wound on the unsub &apos;s jaw ...
it wasn &apos;t there when he spoke to the neighbor in gulfport ,
and there &apos;s no evidence
that any of the victims put up resistance .
well , it could be an accident . accidents do happen .
or it was an interim victim
we don &apos;t know about yet who did fight back .
garcia , can you find a file photo of russell smith ?
yeah .
i &apos;m sending these pictures to your monitors right now .
our unsub &apos;s wound was self @-@ inflicted .
he &apos;s not trying to emulate russell smith .
he &apos;s trying to turn himself into russell smith .
you &apos;ve all been given copies of the sketch of the suspect .
they need to be distributed to
all law enforcement officials in the tri @-@ state area .
all of the unsub &apos;s kills so far
have been in different cities and different states .
we don &apos;t have to worry about flushing him out .
he &apos;s operating in the open
with confidence bordering on arrogance .
we don &apos;t know why , but he &apos;s been leaving
large amounts of insects behind at his crime scenes .
normally , that would be a forensic countermeasure ,
artificially accelerating infestation of the corpse .
or symbolically to degrade and humiliate the victims .
but these larvae are serving some other purpose to the unsub .
it &apos;s like an obsession .
they are an essential component to his kills .
we believe he &apos;s slowly
turning himself into the image of russell smith ,
an alabama serial killer
who &apos;s been dead for nearly 25 years .
the unsub recently cut himself on the jaw
to replicate a similar scar on smith .
and he may continue to alter his appearance .
russell smith had several distinctive scorpion tattoos .
parlors in the region should be notified to be on the lookout
for customers requesting these tattoos .
curiously , the unsub seems
to know precisely who he &apos;s looking for ,
but he refers to his victims by a different name .
which means he &apos;s either delusional or he &apos;s using these victims
as substitutes for someone else . surrogates .
the larvae he &apos;s depositing at the crime scenes
are indigenous to the southwestern united states .
so be on the lookout for suspicious vehicles
with either arizona , nevada ,
or new mexico license plates .
russell smith preyed exclusively on prostitutes
and killed infrequently .
8 victims in 20 @-@ year period .
but this unsub is killing
at a rate of one victim every other day ,
and he &apos;s targeting ordinary citizens .
no one is safe .
through all the birthdays ,
no match between old and new victims .
it looks like we &apos;ve been going down the wrong road .
it may have been the right road in the wrong direction .
garcia , what do the initials t.l. stand for ?
t.l. that would be
taylor lynn .
the unsub kept calling clayton taylor
and brianna carol .
when did smith kill carol hansen ?
i need an exact date .
killed ? that would be march 28 , 1979 .
that &apos;s it . the murder date of the original victim
matches the birthdate of the new one .
garcia ?
i &apos;m all over it . ok .
taylor lynn grover ,
killed february 5 , 1985 .
were any of smith &apos;s original victims killed
the day floressa was born ?
yes . patty johnson .
she was smith &apos;s first victim .
she was murdered on october 9 , 1967 .
what do you want to bet
our killer thought floressa was named patty ?
so this unsub thinks his new victims
are smith &apos;s old victims .
garcia , what about locations ?
where did patty johnson ,
taylor lynn grover , and carol hansen die ?
ok . ok . hold on . give me a sec .
they were all murdered in alabama . in order--
mobile , birmingham , gadsden .
and where were floressa , clayton , and brianna born ?
also in order-- mobile , birmingham ...
and , oh , my god , gadsden .
exact same places , exact same dates .
that &apos;s it . patty , taylor , and carol
were all killed only to be born to live again .
this is about reincarnation .
what are you going to do to me ?
so , this killer believes that smith &apos;s victims didn &apos;t really die ,
but hopped into a newborn life and kept on living .
exactly . reincarnated as floressa ,
charlie clayton , and brianna .
so what &apos;s he doing now , killing them all over again ?
that &apos;s how it looks .
but ... he believes in reincarnation , right ?
who &apos;s to say that these new victims
haven &apos;t just jumped into somebody else &apos;s body ,
the way he believes they did the first time ?
well , maybe in his mind they already have .
see , a fundamental tenet of reincarnation
is that you can come back in any life form , not just human .
that would explain the larvae .
this unsub is introducing a newly hatched life form
next to the victims as he kills them .
it &apos;s a new life form waiting right there ,
ready to receive the spirit of the one that just died .
he thinks that the people he &apos;s killing get reincarnated as flies ?
he &apos;s making sure they don &apos;t come back in human form again .
ensuring that this death ends the cycle .
if he believes it about the victims ,
he must believe it about himself .
garcia , can you find out
exactly where and when russell smith died ,
and then see who was born in the same place at the same time ?
russell smith died january 19 , 1988 .
tuscaloosa . shot .
taken to hobson regional medical center .
willie kestler .
born exact same day , exact same hospital .
do you have an address for kestler ?
it is ... it &apos;s not local .
uh , 3088 lakehawk street ,
apartment 5 , chandler , arizona .
you got a photo ?
i &apos;m sending it to you now .
that &apos;s our guy .
does kestler have a vehicle ?
mm @-@ hmm . he &apos;s the registered owner of a ford bronco ,
1989 , green ,
arizona license plate maq3586 .
sheriff , put out an apb to
all law enforcement within a 200 @-@ mile radius .
i &apos;m on it .
thanks , garcia .
how come you &apos;re doing this ?
it &apos;s that voice in your head .
the one you can &apos;t figure out .
i don &apos;t have a voice in my head .
you do .
maybe it &apos;s not as loud for you as it was for me .
for a long time i didn &apos;t understand .
it was like ...
there was me ...
then there was another me .
then a few years ago ,
right before he died ,
my grandpa told me something that made it all clear .
it was about what happened to me the day i was born .
i was supposed to be born two weeks before .
but i wouldn &apos;t come .
and then when i did ...
things got all ... tangled up inside .
they had to rip my mama open to get me out .
but that was ok .
i had to wait to be born for a reason .
there was a man who got shot that very day .
a killer .
russell smith .
you can &apos;t explain things like this .
it just happens .
it happened to me .
it could happen to you .
my mama died when i was 5 years old
and i had to go live with that bastard .
old man used to smack me around all the time .
no reason .
just mean .
my grandpa always said i had the devil inside me .
the soul of a killer .
that &apos;s crazy .
no .
it wasn &apos;t crazy at all .
after i heard that story , it all made sense .
the voice in my head .
the two mes .
there was only ever one real me all the time .
russell smith .
that &apos;s who i am .
that &apos;s who i &apos;ve always been .
what have you got , garcia ?
chandler p.d. says kestler &apos;s apartment is empty ,
but they found stacks and stacks of books about reincarnation .
all right . do the math with each of smith &apos;s other 5 victims .
find out who was born
the same place at the same time that each was murdered .
that &apos;s who kestler will be going after next .
yes , sir . but this is gonna take a while .
please put on your hat of patience .
hurry .
yeah .
we need to take a ride now .
don &apos;t hurt me . please .
it &apos;s not that i want to .
maybe i am russell smith .
but it didn &apos;t mean i had to be a killer again .
what are you talking about ?
i mean , the whole point of reincarnation
is that you &apos;re supposed to come back
and be better than you were before .
work on your karma .
what i &apos;m doing now ,
it &apos;s self @-@ defense .
one of you found out where i was ,
and you tried to come and cut off my brakes and kill me .
so i had to find you .
all 8 of you .
and then i &apos;ll be done .
oh , let me go .
i promise i won &apos;t tell anybody .
you &apos;re gonna scream your head off , aren &apos;t you ?
as soon as we open the door ,
you &apos;re gonna make a run for it .
no .
i don &apos;t believe you .
no ...
maybe we should just do this right here .
no . no , don &apos;t .
no ...
bad , bad news .
what is it ?
there are 22 possible people
our unsub could be going after ,
and they are scattered everywhere .
i mean everywhere .
nova scotia to hawaii to pennsylvania--
any in the pensacola area ?
no .
there &apos;s a ted sissler ,
who was born the same day in the same place
as one of the older victims from pensacola ,
but he died 13 years ago .
well , that &apos;s good , then , right ?
one less person he &apos;s gonna want to hunt down and kill .
no , that &apos;s bad .
sheriff , check to see if any 13 @-@ year @-@ olds
went missing in the last 24 hours ,
and if ted sissler has any family in the area ,
put them into protective custody immediately .
so , kestler has no criminal record ,
but he has been on the chandler p.d. padar recently .
why ?
3 months ago ,
he was injured in a solo car crash .
claims someone cut his brake lines
and he wanted the police to figure out who did it .
and ?
investigation turned up no evidence of foul play .
but the police said kestler was obsessed over it .
he kept showing up for weeks saying someone was after him .
well , that must have been the trigger .
reincarnation cuts both ways .
kestler thought smith &apos;s old victims
were coming back to get him .
he &apos;s a psychopath .
aidan donahue , 13 years old .
parents said he never came home from school today .
kestler &apos;s car was spotted at a downtown motel .
let &apos;s go .
come here .
no . no , no ...
aidan , it &apos;s all right . we &apos;re the fbi .
we &apos;re the good guys . are you ok ?
the man that was here , where did he go ?
i don &apos;t know .
he just ... took off .
did he say where he was going ?
no . only that this wasn &apos;t over .
he was gonna come back .
here ? he was gonna come back here to this room ?
no . the guy was crazy .
he said he was coming back in 20 years .
he &apos;d come back and get me in 20 years .
i think i know where he &apos;s going .
can i help you ?
yes . i &apos;m looking for the delivery rooms .
is your wife having a baby ?
yes .
patient &apos;s name ?
just tell me where they are .
sir , only family members are allowed back in the delivery area .
now .
sir , i &apos;m going to have to ask you to leave .
attention .
all hospital personnel and visitors immediately
proceed to the nearest exit in an orderly fashion .
repeat--leave the building immediately .
do not interfere with law enforcement .
it &apos;s gonna be ok .
just breathe .
only authorized personnel may transport patients .
repeat--only authorized personnel may transport patients .
you can &apos;t be in here .
the baby .
where is it ?
get out .
get out .
put the baby down and drop your weapon .
willie kestler , it &apos;s over .
there &apos;s nowhere to run .
no !

yesterday while we were in florida ,
a body was found in the desert
outside las cruces , new mexico .

with its mouth sewn shut ,
like the silencer .

that &apos;s how it looks .
this is now an active case ,
