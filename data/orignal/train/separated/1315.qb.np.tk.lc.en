okay .
egg whites for you , doc ,
and house special for you , hon .
thanks ... hon .
at ...
okay . you know what ?
at work , make normal pancakes .
i &apos;d love bunny pancakes .
do not encourage her .
so we &apos;re clear -- no zoo @-@ animal shapes at work .
rabbits are not zoo animals .
well , except for the washington pygmy ,
which is being bred in captivity .
talk about breeding --
i could make bunny pancakes for grandchildren .
mom .
you know what that means .
drop a fork , expect a female visitor .
are you still menstruating , mrs. rizzoli ?
w-- maura ! god . no .
other kind of visitor -- the person kind .
she &apos;s very superstitious , my mother .
she believes in all that stuff about cats and umbrellas
and ladders .
had me convinced i was gonna paralyze her
if i stepped on a crack .
step on a crack , break your mother &apos;s back .
you believed that ?
i was 5 .
don &apos;t you have other customers ?
oh , my god . what is she doing here ?
who &apos;s that ?
frankie &apos;s ex .
oh . looks like your mother likes her .
uh , no .
that would be her &quot; i can &apos;t stand you &quot; hug .
but she way too polite
to call her the word that rhymes with &quot; witch . &quot;
&quot; bitch &quot; ?
jane ?
look who i found !
theresa , how , uh , how you doing ?
jane .
long time .
what are you doing here at ... boston police headquarters ?
just moved back to town .
and you just thought you &apos;d pop by the police department ?
job application .
ah . you &apos;re being fingerprinted ?
it &apos;s mandatory for everyone applying .
sure . sure .
especially for people who have other people co @-@ sign a car loan
and then default on that loan .
good seeing you , too , jane .
see you around .
wow . you just gave her your &quot; i can &apos;t stand you &quot; hug .
sheesh . uncomfortable .
you want uncomfortable ?
try paying off theresa &apos;s car loan
while she skips town and leaves you holding the bag .
well , perhaps you should &apos;ve had her fingerprinted first .
no . not me .
frankie . it &apos;s the love of his life .
he &apos;s very symmetrical .
excuse me ?
well , studies have shown that women
who have symmetrical facial features
are the most attractive to men .
you &apos;re not helping .
rizzoli .
okay . i &apos;ll be right there .
yummy .
theresa &apos;s back to get her manipulative claws in frankie .
maybe she came by to pay back the car loan .
people change .
oh , yeah . that &apos;s it .
maybe she added seven years of interest .
what have we got ?
fire investigators think it was set in the middle of the night .
did u find an i.d. ?
no .
he can &apos;t even --
he can &apos;t even tell if it &apos;s male or female .
why don &apos;t you get a closer look there ?
mnh @-@ mnh .
it &apos;s interesting .
might have to do a full autopsy before i can tell the gender .
i don &apos;t know . this is definitely male .
oh , no .
the less @-@ pronounced supraorbital ridges indicate female .
yes ! okay . so our victim &apos;s definitely female .
that is not fair .
so an accelerant was used .
not gasoline . lighter fluid , maybe ?
variation on pugilistic pose indicates
that her wrists and her ankles were bound .
i think she died right here . there &apos;s no sign of drag marks .
think she was alive when she was set on fire ?
i know , i know . you need time and endless tests .
one thing &apos;s for sure --
we &apos;re not gonna get any fingerprints .
pine scent .
it &apos;s right where a jacket pocket would be .
think she was wearing air freshener ?
no . i think it might be amber .
what &apos;s the shiny thing ?
fixed @-@ bearing prosthesis .
it &apos;s a titanium joint .
it &apos;s a knee replacement .
we don &apos;t need fingerprints . we got a serial number .
thanks .
manufacturer shipped the knee joint
to a boston orthopedic group .
they &apos;re checking patient records .
should have a name any second .
we &apos;re i.d. &apos; ing our victim by her knee replacement .
cool .
so , how &apos;s everything ?
good .
anything ... new today ?
nope . not a thing .
was she here to see you ?
who ?
you know who .
you guys want some privacy ? i can --
what , you mean because my sister is butting into my business ?
i knew it . you were meeting with theresa
if you guys are gonna fight right now --
she was here getting fingerprinted for a job .
and it &apos;s none of your business .
did she pay you back for that camry ?
also not your business .
you bought a car for a chick ?
mm @-@ hmm .
dumb , bro .
excuse me , bro .
we had to scrape him off the ceiling
every time hurricane theresa blew into his life .
oh , you want to go there . fine .
let &apos;s talk about steve sanner .
who &apos;s steve sanner ?
no one .
oh , she was nuts about him .
she started wearing dresses .
you should &apos;ve heard her on the phone .
&quot; hi . steve ? i &apos;m , like , good . you ? &quot;
oop . hello .
implant belonged to helen downey , 43 .
she &apos;s got a license but no car .
she lived in hyde park . that &apos;s close to where we found her .
let &apos;s go check it out .
&quot; bro . &quot;
car ?
you need to put your shoulder into it .
please . show me .
that &apos;s a new guy &apos;s job .
i &apos;ve been the new guy for two years .
i will tell you when you &apos;re not the new guy anymore .
there &apos;s no sign of struggle , so helen wasn &apos;t taken by force .
what is that smell ?
kitty litter box . needs changing .
kitty !
kitty ! kitty ! kitty ! kitty ! kitty !
kitty !
pretty little kitty @-@ kitty .
oh , no . i don &apos;t like black cats .
it &apos;s not a black thing .
it &apos;s just -- it &apos;s your cat baby talk .
hello ... worthington .
you &apos;re a good boy .
poor guy .
she painted his nails pink ?
oh , they &apos;re nail caps .
keep you from tearing the furniture .
that , to me , says that worthington was an inside cat .
&quot; epicurean cat . &quot; pampered , too .
oh , yeah .
oh , this cat &apos;s hungry .
he &apos;s been alone for at least 24 hours .
it &apos;s walking distance to the clearing where we found her .
so maybe helen knew her killer and met him there .
not much of a social butterfly , that helen .
didn &apos;t do much entertaining .
box of historical records . this goes back to --
man , look at this .
1690 . looks original .
she kept everything .
piles of mail , too .
i &apos;ll get crime scene response to box it up and bring it in .
where does this go ? it &apos;s locked .
hey , new guy .
if i end up on disability , it &apos;s on you .
korsak , that looks like disability .
oh , this reminds me of &quot; the devil &apos;s rejects . &quot;
you ever see that one ?
i hate horror films .
haven &apos;t you got enough on your mind ?
hm . you &apos;re missing out .
ever see , uh , &quot; zombies invade boston &quot; ?
how is it you can &apos;t look at a dead body
but you can watch zombies chew their own arms off ?
hi , maura .
crime lab identified the substance in helen &apos;s pocket .
fossilized tree resin -- amber .
okay . that &apos;s great . but i &apos;m a little busy right now .
oh , you got to see this .
can you see what we &apos;re looking at ?
that table looks like an altar .
that looks like a human skull .
i have helen &apos;s cause of death .
what was it ?
did she die by curse ?
no .
i found soot lining her airway , edema in her lung tissue .
maura , is it possible
that helen downey was burned at the stake ?
why ?
because i think helen downey was a witch .
it &apos;s blood , right ?
i don &apos;t know yet .
well , why did you rush all the way over here
if you &apos;re gonna take as long as you take in your lab ?
can you hover somewhere else ?
somebody did get a visitor today .
look at all these weird things .
i had these crazy wiccan neighbors .
aggressive bunch . they took all the parking spaces .
do you think helen was a wiccan witch ?
wicca is a neo @-@ pagan religion .
its practitioners use white magic to bring about good .
this altar doesn &apos;t look like it &apos;s up to anything good .
i agree .
it suggests a darker , more traditional form of witchcraft .
i don &apos;t even want to know how you know that .
phenolphthalein test indicates is blood .
human ?
this is an altar , not a crime lab .
these bones have holes in them .
perforations .
it is from an articulated skeleton .
connected -- like for a science classroom .
yes . it &apos;s perfectly legal . you can buy it on ebay .
yeah , but you can &apos;t buy bowls of blood on ebay .
well , those who practice the dark arts
give blood to use in spells .
again , never tell me how you know this .
black is used to cast an evil spell .
is that hair and fingernails ?
mm . a love spell .
helen never heard of online dating ?
what &apos;s this for ?
amber . it &apos;s used to ward off disease .
that &apos;s the same stuff that we found on helen .
okay . what is she doing to this guy ?
angelica root .
it &apos;s used for protection .
so we &apos;ve got evil , healing , love , and protection .
adds up to one weird victim .
you had to take a witch &apos;s cat .
i &apos;m fostering baretta till he can find a loving home .
baretta .
didn &apos;t want to go through life as worthington .
mm . he tell you that ?
what else he tell you ?
he eats saute chicken livers , like down pillows ?
leave him alone . he &apos;s the sweetest cat in the world .
helen collected genealogies .
look at these family trees .
john proctor . william hobbs .
this is incredible . look at the date -- 1692 .
that &apos;s when the salem witch trials began .
maybe helen was descended from witches .
take any history at southie high ?
puritans persecuted anybody who was different .
yeah . witchcraft was a felony punishable by death .
oh , okay . this is cool , too .
it &apos;s a deed of trust from the land where we found helen &apos;s body .
it &apos;s been modified , but the original date is 1680 .
the land where helen was killed
belonged to her family for centuries .
three acres in hyde park . what &apos;s that worth ?
a lot .
she could &apos;ve used the money , too .
letters from her landlord . she was behind in her rent .
helen was a descendant of william and mary warrick .
wow . early settlers of salem .
land was passed to her through all these generations .
slaves came with it back in the day .
good times in colonial boston .
hey , women were considered property .
what are you looking at me for ?
i don &apos;t even have a cleaning lady .
what &apos;s with the registered letters ?
all from the same guy .
real estate agent . robert cranston .
cranston .
hi . i &apos;m robert cranston . and if you ...
hey , that &apos;s the guy that &apos;s getting the evil curse
in helen &apos;s basement .
he &apos;s also a real estate developer
who &apos;s been buying up all the land around helen &apos;s property .
what for ?
he &apos;s building a monster mall there .
he offered helen $ 3 million for her land .
so he owns all the parcels except helen &apos;s .
lone holdout .
looks like helen kept him from building his mall .
that cost him .
do you have her will yet ?
no .
okay .
she &apos;s not married . no will .
maybe cranston can &apos;t get her land unless he kills her
and buys it from the estate .
well , that would be an offer she couldn &apos;t refuse .
we appreciate you coming in .
i don &apos;t have a lot of time .
we &apos;re going to need to know where you were saturday --
day and nighttime .
i was in worcester , at the grand @-@ opening celebration
of my newest gated community .
and then i was asleep at my hotel .
check . you &apos;ll see .
could you turn that off , please ?
it &apos;s business .
i do a lot of it .
did you ever meet with helen downey ?
once . that was enough . she &apos;s nuts .
&apos;cause she wouldn &apos;t sell her property to you ?
i offered her $ 3 million for that weed patch --
double what it was worth .
she said it was sacred .
why did she think it was sacred ?
something to do with her ancestors , witches .
who knows ? whack job .
we &apos;re investigating helen downey &apos;s murder .
am i under arrest ?
no .
then i know both my rights and my way out .
too bad we can &apos;t hold him for being a sleazebag .
guy that rich wouldn &apos;t dirty his own hands .
yeah . probably not . he &apos;d hire somebody .
i &apos;ll check out his alibi ,
run background checks on his employees .
the blood in the bowl didn &apos;t belong to helen .
any chance we &apos;ll get a dna hit ?
possibly .
i &apos;m still waiting on the results
from the fingernails and hair from the altar .
did you find anything to confirm that helen was crazy ?
korsak said that the real estate developer claims
she was a nut bar .
you know , the genetics of mental illnesses
are much more complex than the genetics
of many of the rare , single @-@ gene diseases .
&quot; yes &quot; or &quot; no &quot; -- perfectly good answers .
no .
i &apos;m going as fast as i can .
three sandwiches . big lunch .
yeah . i &apos;m meeting some people .
is that why you &apos;re wearing all that cologne ?
it &apos;s quite lovely .
hints of orange blended with notes of cedar and ...
... verbena .
yeah . thanks .
ma , i got to run .
okay .
see ya . bye .
enjoy !
where &apos;s he off to ?
a picnic at the public gardens .
is it with theresa ?
oh , i hope not .
i mean , how could he not remember
how much pain she put me through ?
you ?
ma , he was depressed for months when she found a new guy
and dumped him on his ass -- again .
i remember .
that can be quite serious .
broken heart syndrome ,
also known as stress cardiomyopathy .
it can cause rapid and severe heart @-@ muscle weakness .
oh , my god .
you got to do something .
you see him ?
no .
it &apos;s hot , and i smell like a french fry .
that &apos;s because we &apos;re direct sunlight .
i know that , 007 . that &apos;s why i &apos;m hot .
you feel that . ventilation fan .
magic .
no .
solar panels on the roof of my car .
they automatically generate enough electricity
to cool us off .
how green .
isn &apos;t it ?
does it get rid of french @-@ fry smell ?
how is it that you can &apos;t lie
but you can talk me into spying on my brother ?
we &apos;re not spying . we &apos;re not .
we are gathering data to test a hypothesis ,
which is the first step of scientific inquiry .
nice try .
we -- you and i -- are snooping , meddling .
we are sticking our noses where they do not belong .
oh , my god .
i just turned into my mother .
hypothesis confirmed --
i would recognize that cheap dye job anywhere .
it &apos;s korsak .
rizzoli .
and isles .
we found helen downey &apos;s will .
she left her land to three people .
they all live in old salem .
sending you the photos now .
see the goofball with all the piercings ?
yeah .
grayson bennett , 33 .
who &apos;s the beautiful one with the lip stud ?
sage molette , 29 .
and the young one is sabrina scott .
sabrina is a very old welsh name .
it &apos;s also a name of the teenage witch .
all three of them work at the spellbox .
oh , that &apos;s an occult store .
what , you shop there ?
i &apos;ve bought gifts .
got to go .
hi . what are you doing here ?
you followed me .
we did .
but we &apos;re just testing a hypothesis .
we are not snooping .
oh , really ? what &apos;s your hypothesis ?
if i meet theresa for lunch ,
it &apos;s your business ?
no , we were trying to determine
whether you &apos;re getting back together .
please stop talking .
hypotheses require rigorous testing . it &apos;s --
you want to know what i &apos;m doing here ?
no .
fine .
this is my daughter .
lily , say hi to your aunt jane .
hi .
hello .
you want a french fry ?
no . my mom says they make you look fat .
lily is adorable . she looks like frankie .
yeah . she &apos;s really cute .
and innocent , unlike her mother .
my gut says theresa &apos;s broke
and she &apos;s using her kid to get frankie back .
paternity is very easy to check .
oh , sure , maura .
i &apos;ll just ask lily for a little saliva .
we got a lot of work to do . let &apos;s get to salem .
they call it &quot; city of peace &quot; now .
that &apos;s very nice of them ,
since they put 19 innocent people to death
in the witch trials .
what ? salem was my favorite field trip .
i &apos;ve been there six times .
i can &apos;t believe she &apos;s gone .
what was your relationship to helen downey ?
we were members of the same coven .
make sure to get the names of the other nine .
what ?
&quot; coven . &quot;
it &apos;s the middle english word for &quot; convent . &quot;
it &apos;s an assembly of 13 witches .
are there 13 members of your coven ?
only four .
but helen was working on building our membership .
we &apos;re hereditary witches .
that means -- - six field trips .
i got this .
okay .
that means you inherited your practices
and rituals and magic from ancestors .
that explains all the genealogy
stuff we found at helen &apos;s .
mm @-@ hmm .
would it surprise you to know
that helen named the three of you in her will ?
no . we were her family .
and yet there &apos;s only a photo of you on her altar .
seems she was attempting a love spell .
were you ever involved with helen ?
yes .
but i realized for our coven to function ...
... each of our lives had to be equally intertwined .
did you all intertwine in helen &apos;s basement ?
we performed rituals . yes .
okay .
we &apos;re gonna need to collect dna samples from you .
i &apos;m gonna need to swab the inside of your mouths ,
if that &apos;s all right .
also , do any of you recognize this man ?
it &apos;s the reverend william scott .
scott ?
that &apos;s your last name , isn &apos;t it ?
is he your father ?
yes .
were you aware
that helen had cast a protective spell against him ?
my father wasn &apos;t happy that i had joined .
did your father ever make any threats against helen ?
he would never hurt anyone . he &apos;s a man of god .
man of god .
same men who &apos;ve persecuted us for hundreds of years .
do you know of anyone that would want helen dead ?
you know what ?
why don &apos;t we ask helen ?
because helen &apos;s dead .
i think he means a seance .
we &apos;ll have one tonight --
at her home .
you &apos;re welcome to attend .
seance ?
what ever happened to the good old @-@ fashioned interrogation ?
come on . it &apos;ll be fun .
like traveling to borneo .
investigative work is not supposed to be fun .
that &apos;s why they call it &quot; work . &quot;
borneo ? really ?
well , my work is fun .
you think frankie told your mom ?
no way .
did you hear the good news ? i &apos;m a grandmother .
isn &apos;t it wonderful ?
okay .
ma , slow down , all right ?
isn &apos;t she adorable ?
she uses a napkin and she chews with her mouth closed .
unlike her mother .
listen , lily can &apos;t help it
her mother is a bit --
a @-@ a bit flaky .
look , let &apos;s let bygones be bygones .
it &apos;s very healthy to move past old grievances .
no one asked you .
and i &apos;m not ready to withdraw my grievances against theresa .
dr. isles ...
could i possibly trouble you
to host a little family get @-@ together ?
no .
of course .
thank you .
what was that ?
hospitality ?
no , ms. buttinsky . it was butting in .
got helen &apos;s phone records .
sabrina &apos;s father , the reverend ,
called her hundreds of times in the last six months .
so he was harassing helen .
helen convinced my daughter she had
inherited mystical powers .
how &apos;d she do that ?
helen found sabrina ,
showed her our family ancestry .
my daughter didn &apos;t know we are related to sarah good .
the sarah good --
who was put to death for witchcraft in 1692 ?
you don &apos;t believe your ancestor was a witch , do you ?
i know that sarah good was a devil worshiper .
that &apos;s what helen was , too .
she made my daughter reject her faith and her family .
that must &apos;ve made you angry .
yes .
and it also broke my heart .
in her restraining order ,
sabrina said you tried to abduct her .
i hired a deprogrammer .
i was trying to get her away
from those that were leading her astray .
can you blame me ?
only if you killed helen downey .
as god as my witness , i did not .
well , don &apos;t go anywhere .
we may need to speak to you again .
okay . let &apos;s put someone on him 24 / 7 .
guy gives me the creeps , too .
ugh . what is she doing ?
a feeding ritual .
in the hua society of new guinea ,
feeding and sexual intercourse
are believed to transfer the vital essence , nu .
i &apos;m leaving if sexual intercourse is next .
i &apos;m not .
me either .
we call upon the powers that be
to open a doorway to the other side
and allow us to conjure , stir ,
and summon the spirit of helen downey .
i don &apos;t like this .
it &apos;s okay .
if you get scared , you can hold my hand .
helen ... are you with us ?
&quot; fig . &quot;
ooh . spooky .
i just had one in your honor , helen .
she loved figs .
no kidding .
no , maura . no kidding .
helen , do you know who killed you ?
yes .
how reliable is that thing ?
i am your vessel .
tell me -- who killed you , helen ?
my killer ... is near !
helen said the killer is near .
really ? &quot; helen said &quot; ?
well , you &apos;re right . that sounded a little silly .
a little .
i don &apos;t suppose you &apos;ve heard of the ideomotor effect .
sure . that &apos;s when idiots pretend to talk to the dead .
unconscious muscular actions in response to a thought or idea .
it could be why the board moved .
fake . phony .
like theresa ,
who i now get to watch chew with her mouth open ,
thanks to you .
okay . it &apos;s heavy .
okay !
frankie , you get to do the honors .
you sure ?
yeah .
okay .
ma &apos;s never let anybody but pop cut the meat before .
well , now that frankie &apos;s a father .
we don &apos;t know that , maura .
so , how &apos;d the job interview go ?
good .
they said they &apos;d let me know by the end of the week .
so , uh , you looking into the food @-@ service industries ?
i haven &apos;t worked in a fast @-@ food restaurant in years .
i &apos;m in medicine now .
medicine ? really ?
i &apos;m a nurse -- oh . nurse &apos;s aide .
oh , wow . that &apos;s great .
so you , like , change sheets
and empty bedpans -- that sort of stuff ?
i &apos;m getting certified .
that &apos;s wonderful .
i &apos;m sure you &apos;re a very nurturing person .
yeah , that &apos;s -- that &apos;s what we &apos;ve always said about her .
isn &apos;t that right , mom ?
we sure did .
would you like a potato ?
so , uh , what brings you back to boston ?
i wanted my daughter to have some stability .
be around family , you know ?
of course . family is the --
how are your parents ?
jane ?
thank you .
wow . lily , my goodness . you are so grown @-@ up .
how old are you ?
seven .
seven ?
you are almost as old as your mommy &apos;s camry .
jane , come help me in the kitchen .
i &apos;m not finished .
this will just take a second .
hey , frankie , get me some more wine .
uh , lily , would -- would you like some more milk ?
yes , please .
i &apos;ll get it for you , baby .
she is so well @-@ mannered .
that &apos;s the mother of my child .
you sure about that ?
she &apos;s always taken advantage of you , lied to you --
cheated on you .
will you stop ?
no !
i can &apos;t stand to see this happen again --
not to you and not to that little girl .
lily is not some car you can buy with theresa .
she deserves to know the truth , frankie , and so do you .
you are really lucky there &apos;s company around .
frankie . come -- come here !
yeah , frost . what &apos;s up ?
what ? when ?
all right . we &apos;ll be right there .
what &apos;s the matter ?
we got to go . another witch got attacked .
get your purse .
what ?
get your purse .
oh , my god . i &apos;m going straight to hell .
i &apos;m stealing the sippy cup .
go to the car . go .
we know what happened ?
sabrina was alone ,
closing out the register , when she was attacked .
was it a robbery ?
don &apos;t think so . the money &apos;s still there .
she was lucky .
weren &apos;t for that sculpture ,
she &apos;d have been crushed to death .
i want to talk to her .
she &apos;s pretty shook up .
okay .
hi , sabrina .
you remember me ? i &apos;m detective rizzoli .
i &apos;m a doctor . i can check her out .
hi , sabrina .
can you follow my light with your eyes ?
can you tell us what happened ?
i ...
i don &apos;t know .
do you remember how the bookcase fell over ?
someone pushed it onto me .
did you see who that was ?
no .
i heard a voice .
was it a male or a female voice ?
what did the voice say ?
&quot; thou shalt not suffer a witch to live . &quot;
she needs a cat scan .
this bookcase weighs hundreds of pounds .
somebody strong must have pushed it on her .
question is , how &apos;d they get in ?
door was locked . police officers had to break in .
helen the witch is burned alive .
sabrina almost gets crushed to death .
maybe this is a witch @-@ hunt .
i think it &apos;s a real estate hunt .
look what i found by the cash register .
our sleazebag real estate agent stopped by .
well , you said helen &apos;s will divided her land evenly
between the three coven members .
you think cranston was trying to get all three to sell ?
if he was , my money &apos;s on grayson .
sabrina and sage don &apos;t pee without his permission .
he had the motive , the muscle , and the keys to this place .
let &apos;s go find him .
hey . new guy .
boston police !
korsak .
you &apos;re the only other one with a key to the spellbox .
where did you go after the scenes ?
no , it &apos;s not me .
i didn &apos;t do this .
i was in needham teaching a candle @-@ making class .
sabrina &apos;s dead , isn &apos;t she ?
no .
she &apos;s in the hospital .
they &apos;re trying to kill us .
it &apos;s as it was before --
burning , pressing ... drowning .
all means of execution for witches .
there aren &apos;t any witches .
i &apos;m scared .
i &apos;m so scared .
real estate developer has got a solid alibi .
what about the reverend ?
police officer says he never left his house .
we don &apos;t have enough to hold her .
you &apos;re free to go .
no . no . please .
can i please stay here ?
that &apos;s a first .
suspect who wants to spend the night .
i &apos;m so afraid . please .
maybe we put her up in a hotel until all this is over .
what about my cats ?
can &apos;t leave your cats .
you live in salem , right ?
we &apos;ll escort you home .
we &apos;ll notify salem police to increase patrol presence
in your neighborhood .
thank you .
what makes people put all those holes in their heads
and in their ... ugh !
tongue and both nipples ?
it &apos;s nothing new , though .
roman centurions used to attach their capes
to their nipple piercings .
okay . that &apos;s good .
perimortem bruising around his face , his neck , and his chest .
he was forcibly drowned ?
yes .
and there &apos;s skin and blood under his fingernails .
he &apos;s trying to loosen his attacker &apos;s grip .
we might have our killer &apos;s dna .
i &apos;ll process it .
hey , you wouldn &apos;t happen to have a solvent
that will dissolve the glue on baretta &apos;s plastic claws , huh ?
well , they &apos;re designed to fall off eventually ,
but i can try slicing the caps off with my scalpel .
no !
well , i won &apos;t hurt him .
okay .
i don &apos;t suppose anybody is gonna
adopt him with pink claws .
where is it , maura ?
where &apos;s the princess cup ?
i should go .
w @-@ well , let me cut the caps off first .
never mind . pink &apos;s nice .
i know jane took lily &apos;s cup .
where is it ?
don &apos;t be mad at jane .
she just did it because she loves you .
what &apos;s your excuse ?
well , i have a bigger purse .
and access to superior paternity testing .
oh , yeah ? well , guess what .
i &apos;m getting my own paternity test .
and if lily turns out to be mine ,
i @-@ i &apos;m gonna be the dad that she deserves .
and janie &apos;s just gonna have to accept it .
that &apos;s very admirable , frankie .
clearly , theresa needs a good guy like you in her life .
well , i &apos;m never getting back with theresa .
it &apos;s about lily now .
ma ?
oh , i must &apos;ve gotten lost .
uh , what &apos;s that behind your back ?
nothing .
oh , dr. isles is working . i &apos;d better come back .
that &apos;s ok .
i can still talk while i analyze stomach contents .
what &apos;s this in the bag ?
you got to be kidding me .
i &apos;m sorry , frankie . i have to know for your sake .
i have to talk to jane .
just got a breakthrough in this case .
but you &apos;re welcome to stay here and finish this argument .
gee , thanks .
jane .
remember the figs that
sage fed grayson at the scene ?
yes . put me off of fig newtons for life .
they &apos;re still in his stomach .
signs of mastication ,
but very little enzymatic or acid activity .
so ... he was dead before they had time to digest .
welll , the scene was at 6 : 00 .
the figs were in his stomach
for no longer than an hour before he was killed .
you &apos;re saying grayson was killed before sabrina was attacked .
yes . and you found skin and blood under his fingernails .
dna back ?
not yet .
our killer will have defensive wounds .
well , it wasn &apos;t sage . she didn &apos;t have a mark on her .
frost , can you pull up a picture of sabrina ?
sabrina had abrasions on her face .
yeah , but i didn &apos;t see her arms . she was wearing long sleeves .
i got crime @-@ scene photos from salem p.d.
look at sabrina &apos;s hands .
okay . could those gouges be from grayson &apos;s fingernails ?
it &apos;s possible .
so sabrina ... could &apos;ve killed grayson
and then staged her own attack at the spellbox .
how ? grayson was held underwater .
yeah , and those bookshelves weighed hundreds of pounds .
crime @-@ lab results are back
from the blood in the bowl at the altar .
all right , helen &apos;s attempt at a healing spell --
who was she trying to heal ?
sabrina &apos;s blood was in the bowl .
anything in sabrina &apos;s tox screen ?
i mean , drugs could explain the superhuman strength .
if she was on pcp , that would explain it .
no . there &apos;s no drugs in her system .
well , something was wrong with sabrina .
because helen was trying to heal her .
yeah .
jane , i think you &apos;re right .
sabrina &apos;s dna results show that chromosome 8 and 13
are at 8p22 @-@ p21 and 13q .
later that same day ...
many of those accused of witchcraft
were suffering from mental disorders .
no ! you mean they weren &apos;t really witches ?
sabrina scott was descended from sarah good .
yes , who was one of the first women put to death in salem .
and sarah good was probably suffering from schizophrenia .
which can be inherited , right ?
yes . and it usually strikes in early adulthood .
it &apos;s characterized by hallucinations ,
delusions , bizarre behavior .
oh , god . like -- like thinking you &apos;re a witch .
sabrina does have the genetic markers for the disease .
you know , i &apos;ve arrested schizophrenics
in the middle of a psychotic break .
they are crazy strong and -- and out of control ,
like being on pcp .
hi . yeah . this is detective jane rizzoli .
i need to put a security detail on sabrina scott , please .
w @-@ when ?
okay . thank you .
sabrina checked out of the hospital a.m.a.
against medical advice ?
we got find sabrina before she gets to sage .
all right , korsak , thanks a lot .
sabrina &apos;s not at her apartment , she &apos;s not at the store ,
and she &apos;s not at her father &apos;s house .
all right .
that was salem police . they can &apos;t find sage either .
well , sabrina &apos;s taken out two members of her coven .
she &apos;s not gonna stop until she finds sage .
think , guys . where would she be ?
well , what probably caused her schizophrenic break
is this conflict between her adoption of witchcraft
and her religious upbringing .
okay . that &apos;s a &quot; why , &quot; not a &quot; where . &quot;
she heard scripture during her attack at the store .
that &apos;s it .
the voices in her head are telling her
to go back to her old faith .
thou shalt not suffer a witch to live .
kill her . evil shall be punished .
do it ! evil must be destroyed .
sabrina , stop !
stop . put the gas can down , okay ?
no ! do not try to stop me .
we must die by fire .
put the torch down , all right ? you don &apos;t have to do this .
all she perceives is a threat .
she &apos;s in the middle of a psychotic break .
i &apos;m not gonna let her kill sage .
distract her . talk to her .
sabrina ?
sabrina ?
death to witches .
don &apos;t think that you need to punish sage
the way that you punished helen .
helen was a devil worshiper !
grayson worshiped satan .
they were the dark ones -- witches .
she must die
sage is evil .
a devil worshiper !
she must die . - no . sabrina --
yes ! she is ! no .
you aren &apos;t evil .
die .
sabrina !
please help me .
i have sinned !
it &apos;s okay .
it &apos;s all right . it &apos;s all right . it &apos;s all right .
poor sabrina .
they took her to bridgewater .
at least doctors there will keep her stabilized ,
keep her from having psychotic episodes .
it was sad .
schizophrenia is a terrible illness .
better than being burned at the stake
or drowned in your bathtub .
what the hell happened to you ?
nothing .
those look like cat scratches .
baretta got a little uptight
when i took the caps off .
oh , the sweetest cat in the world ?
how many stitches , ace ventura ?
six .
didn &apos;t hurt .
what you eating ? humble pie ?
i deserve that .
i &apos;m sorry , okay ? i &apos;m a jerk .
yeah , you are .
lily &apos;s a -- she &apos;s a nice girl .
and i &apos;m gonna be a great aunt , okay ?
i promise .
nope . you won &apos;t be .
got the paternity test back .
lily &apos;s not my daughter .
i &apos;m sorry , frankie .
yeah . you know what ?
so am i.
you &apos;ll make a really good father someday .
yeah . someday .
that &apos;s too bad .
i was really looking forward to holidays with theresa .
what are we gonna do about ma ?
she like cats ?
oh , don &apos;t even think about it .
baretta is very sweet .
okay . it &apos;s your house .
come here . sit down .
let me buy you a beer .
