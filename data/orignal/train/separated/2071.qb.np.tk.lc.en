your execution date has been set .
when ?
30 days .
you said you were gonna find maria .
you have one week to find a witness .
after that , his execution date is set in stone .
we found the guy who &apos;s been feeding sutter his information .
phillip allen . i know .
he came by to cut a deal two hours ago ,
so i gave him one .
no you goddamn didn &apos;t .
relax .
as far as the sec is concerned , mike lead directly
to the witness who &apos;s gonna put that piece of shit away
for the rest of his life .
you have a small window to come clean with the sec
and save yourself .
i would never turn on my own father .
i didn &apos;t take this deal for that son of a bitch .
i took it for my wife .
and if you ever contact her again without my blessing ,
i swear to god , i will beat the shit out of you .
jim rogers found your missing witness .
she died three years ago .
you &apos;re informing on your roommate .
i know it , and if you don &apos;t get me out of here soon ,
your bunkmate &apos;s gonna know it , too .
they pulled mike &apos;s deal .
goddamn it , i drove that guy to you !
if i tell them that ,
they &apos;re gonna know what we did .
sean , please , there &apos;s got to be
another way to make this happen .
i &apos;m sorry , harvey , there isn &apos;t .
jessica , can i talk to you for a second ?
harvey , can it wait ?
i just got some bad news about our death row case .
no , it can &apos;t .
cahill just pulled mike &apos;s deal .
what ?
i thought he was a man of his word .
he &apos;s saying it wasn &apos;t him .
it was his superiors , but what difference does it make ?
it makes all the difference in the world ,
because if it &apos;s him , you can go over his head .
i go over his head ,
everybody knows we &apos;re in on this thing together .
so what you &apos;re telling me is ,
not only are they pulling mike &apos;s deal ,
but you &apos;re going to lose this case for nothing ?
yeah .
i guess that &apos;s what i &apos;m telling you .
then you &apos;re not gonna like what i have to say .
but if mike &apos;s not getting out ,
you might as well win .
what ?
harvey , we &apos;re in the middle of building ourselves back up .
you lose this case , we take it in the knee .
jessica , the guy is guilty .
and you &apos;re his goddamn lawyer .
and you took this case .
and i never would have taken it
if it wasn &apos;t to get mike out .
well , you did take it .
and if it &apos;s just gonna kick us back down the mountain ,
then i don &apos;t care what it takes .
you win that goddamn case .
we &apos;re gathered to hear the united states
versus william sutter on the charges of insider trading .
is the prosecution prepared to deliver its opening statement ?
we are , your honor .
ladies and gentlemen of the jury ,
william sutter has been earning outrageous returns
for decades .
now , i &apos;m sure the defense is going to try to
convince you mr. sutter trades with his gut
or his instinct or some mysterious explanation
that is impossible to verify .
but that isn &apos;t how he makes his money .
and we can prove it .
we have a witness that can document giving
inside information to william sutter time
and time again over the last ten years .
and when we present that witness to you ,
you &apos;ll be leaping out of your chair to convict
that man beyond a reasonable doubt .
mr. specter .
what the hell witness is he talking about ?
didn &apos;t it have to be in discovery ?
it sure as hell did .
what &apos;re you gonna do about it ?
i &apos;m gonna stop it dead in its tracks .
mr. specter ,
is the defense ready to deliver its opening statement ?
no , your honor , but we are ready to request
an immediate three @-@ day delay of these proceedings .
on what grounds ?
the prosecution knows what grounds ,
because he just violated the rules of discovery .
your honor ,
i have absolutely no idea what he &apos;s talking about .
yes , you do because you just introduced a witness
into your opening statement
and this is the first i &apos;m hearing about it .
it &apos;s the first you &apos;re hearing about it
because the witness just came forward yesterday .
i &apos;m sorry , did the internet go down ?
did you go over the limit on your friends and family plan ?
because we &apos;re required to be notified
and i don &apos;t even know what this person &apos;s name is .
his name is phillip allen and he &apos;s prepared
to put that man behind bars where he belongs .
mr. cahill , that &apos;s enough .
your honor , we need three days to depose this witness .
this is ridiculous .
they &apos;ve lost , they know it , and they &apos;re just trying to stall .
then you should have thought of that before you decided
to drop this bomb in my courtroom .
mr. specter , you have three days .
i wasn &apos;t expecting you so soon .
we have some news we wanted to give you in person .
we found maria gomez .
leonard , she died three years ago .
what does that mean ?
it means that we have five more days to find
something we can use to get your case re @-@ opened .
that sounds like a polite way of telling me that in 30 days ,
i &apos;m gone .
and what if there was a way to get us more than five days ?
let &apos;s take it .
you have the right to have a family member
present at your execution .
if you have a relative that &apos;s sick ,
who needs time to get better to travel ,
we can petition the court for a delay
and they have to grant it .
the woman who raised me , my aunt harriet .
she has ms.
but that &apos;s not gonna do us any good ,
because she doesn &apos;t want anything to do with me .
she never came to visit you ?
she thinks i &apos;m guilty .
says i brought shame on the family .
even if you did , you need her now .
she has to see that .
i reached out to her , rachel ,
a thousand times my first years here .
i wrote her that there &apos;s nothing i needed
more than to know that i had her support .
she didn &apos;t give it to me then , and ...
she &apos;s not gonna give it to me now .
well , maybe if she could see that
two women like us believe in you ,
then she &apos;ll be able to believe in you , too .
if you can make that happen ,
that would mean the world to me .
then we &apos;ll make that happen .
that was nice work in there .
think it was good enough to get us a mistrial ?
mistrial ?
you &apos;re lucky they didn &apos;t find you guilty after that .
what the hell are you talking about ?
enough bullshit , william .
this isn &apos;t the sec asking anymore , this is me .
who the hell is phillip allen
and what the hell is he gonna tell them ?
he &apos;s an investment banker , used to work for me .
he &apos;s not gonna tell them shit about me
because he doesn &apos;t know shit about me .
then why were you so surprised when they said they had him ?
because he can tell them about my daughter .
i get it .
he gives inside information to her ,
so if this goes down ,
she goes down instead of you .
no one &apos;s going down .
&apos;cause they can &apos;t prove
she told me what he told her .
which means , if you do your job ,
we both get off .
william , you &apos;re taking a huge risk .
what the hell you think i hired a gunslinger like you for ?
so stop telling me i can &apos;t win
and go ahead and start winning .
第六季 第八集
you keep eating eggs every morning ,
you &apos;re gonna have a heart attack .
didn &apos;t you hear ?
they &apos;re good for you now .
what happens five years from now
when they become bad for you again ?
worried something &apos;s gonna happen to me ?
i &apos;m worried i &apos;m gonna have to deal with another roommate .
took me long enough to get used to you .
kevin ...
i &apos;m sorry .
water under the bridge .
all right ? you had my best interest in mind .
you want some bacon ?
man , that &apos;s always gonna be good for you .
amen to that , brother .
look who it is . frick and frack .
we &apos;re in the middle of a conversation , gallo .
oh , i bet you are .
mike here &apos;s an excellent listener , isn &apos;t he , kevin ?
what do you want ?
nothing .
it &apos;s just nice to see you guys are such good friends .
nice to know you can trust each other .
i only wish i could trust that
mike here was really working on getting me out on parole .
we are working on it .
well , you &apos;re running out of time .
would you listen to me , gallo ?
no , there &apos;s no listening !
you got until 6 : 00 tonight to get harvey down here
or after that ,
i &apos;m gonna schedule a little hearing of my own .
can i help you ?
i hope so .
my name &apos;s rachel zane .
and i &apos;m a lawyer working on your nephew &apos;s case .
my nephew &apos;s case was over a long time ago .
and thank god for that .
ma &apos;am .
i &apos;m here because we believe
leonard was wrongly convicted of those murders .
well , that &apos;s what they all say , isn &apos;t it ?
but just because he suckered you ,
doesn &apos;t mean he &apos;s gonna sucker me .
he didn &apos;t sucker anyone .
i looked at the evidence and i got to know the man .
so you got proof he didn &apos;t do it ?
we &apos;re working on it .
but if we can &apos;t find a way to push back the execution ,
then in 30 days it won &apos;t matter anymore .
what do you want from me ?
i want you to ask the court for a delay
so you can be with him at his execution .
i &apos;m not gonna watch him die .
ms. deon , please .
you raised him .
i raised leonard from when he was 14 to 17 .
i took him in , i loved him ,
he was no good then and he &apos;s no good now .
well , if that &apos;s the case ,
you don &apos;t have to be at the execution .
but if you could sign this request
that says you &apos;re too infirm to travel this month ,
it will at least give him the chance to prove you wrong .
i &apos;ll sign your letter .
but i &apos;m not watching him die .
thank you .
there you are .
i &apos;ve been on pins and needles all morning .
how was dinner ?
it was a complete and total shit show , donna .
louis , what happened ?
what happened was ,
i found out the woman of my dreams is spoken for .
she &apos;s married ?
she might as well be .
she has this long @-@ term boyfriend who lives in california
and they have this arrangement where they see other people .
and even though it was the most wonderful night of my life ,
i &apos;m moving on .
i don &apos;t understand .
the most wonderful night of your life ?
why did you even stay through dinner ?
because she gave me some line about being the only person
she &apos;d ever done this with .
but now that i think about it ,
what the hell difference does that make ?
i think it makes all the difference in the world .
what &apos;re you talking about ?
louis , if you &apos;re really the only man
she &apos;s ever done this with ,
then that means you &apos;ve got something
that this other man doesn &apos;t have .
how could you know that ?
they &apos;ve been together three years .
i can &apos;t compete with that .
because when you &apos;re happy ,
you don &apos;t go looking somewhere else .
donna--
louis , i told you i broke up with mitchell ,
but i didn &apos;t tell you why .
he wanted to see other people .
he wanted to move in with me .
and when he asked me , i started picturing a life with him .
and that &apos;s when i knew he wasn &apos;t the right one for me .
how can i know i &apos;m the one for her ?
you can &apos;t .
but you &apos;ll never know if you don &apos;t fight for her .
harvey specter &apos;s office .
you have a call from danbury federal prison .
do you accept--
yes .
donna , it &apos;s me , i need to talk to him .
i don &apos;t have him , mike , he &apos;s in court .
i don &apos;t care where he is .
i need to know what &apos;s going on with gallo &apos;s parole hearing .
nothing &apos;s going on .
what the hell do you mean &quot; nothing &apos;s going on &quot; ?
harvey was hoping that you were gonna be out of there
before he had to go through with it .
goddamn it , donna ,
gallo knows about me and cahill .
if he doesn &apos;t see some progress by the end of the day ,
he &apos;s gonna tell kevin .
mike , harvey didn &apos;t want you to know this yet , but ...
there is no you and cahill .
what ?
cahill pulled your deal .
what the hell are you talking about ?
his superiors said
you didn &apos;t hold up your end of the bargain .
that is bullshit !
i &apos;ve been busting my ass to hold up my end of the bargain .
i know that and harvey knows that ,
and he &apos;s trying to get your deal back .
well , you tell him that while he &apos;s getting around
to making cahill honor his goddamn word ,
maybe he could take just a minute to honor his word
and get gallo his goddamn parole hearing .
i got it .
she signed it ?
she did , and an affidavit from her doctor , too .
all right , i &apos;ll go to court and make this happen .
you start going back through every piece of evidence we have
because this gives us some breathing room
to find something , but we have to deliver .
jessica ...
look , rachel ,
i know you want to go to court with me ,
but we don &apos;t have the time--
no , that &apos;s not it .
well , then what is it ?
she signed the request , but ...
she wouldn &apos;t actually agree to be there with him if--
rachel .
it &apos;s not our job to reunite him with his family
if it comes to it .
it is our job to make sure it doesn &apos;t come to it .
i meant she doesn &apos;t want to come
because she thinks that he did it .
and if we can &apos;t convince his own aunt that he &apos;s innocent ,
how are we gonna convince 12 strangers ?
right now , i &apos;d rather focus on the fact that
we &apos;re getting the man another 30 days to save his life .
mike , sit down .
i need to talk to you .
you needed to talk to me yesterday
when cahill decided to pull my deal .
he &apos;s saying it was the people above him .
and i didn &apos;t want to tell you about it
until i figured out how to get it back .
yeah , well the amount of things you &apos;re not telling me
are really starting to pile up .
i know you found out about gallo .
i &apos;m sorry .
but i give you my word , it &apos;s being taken care of .
oh , like my deal was being taken care of ?
listen to me .
i &apos;m gonna neutralize phillip allen
so you still have a chance to walk out of here .
but that &apos;s not gonna happen if you don &apos;t get jill miller
to testify against her father .
goddamn it , harvey , i &apos;ve been down that road .
jill &apos;s not gonna go for it and neither is kevin .
well , then you better figure out a way to make him ,
because once i blow phillip allen out of the water ,
the next person up on cahill &apos;s hit list is kevin &apos;s wife .
hello ?
hey , tara .
it &apos;s me , louis litt .
i know who you are , louis ,
you don &apos;t have to use your last name .
well , i don &apos;t like to be presumptuous .
i mean , you can have another man--i mean--
you can have another louis in your life .
speaking of other men , louis .
i &apos;m glad you called back .
i had an amazing time the other night ,
but i wasn &apos;t sure you were okay with
what i told you about me having a--
oh , please , tara , it &apos;s 2016 .
if a man can &apos;t be okay with his woman seeing other men ,
then what was susan b. anthony even fighting for ?
well in that case , louis litt ,
how &apos;d you like to go out tonight ?
tonight ?
i &apos;d love to .
then tell me where to be ,
and i &apos;ll meet you there at 7 : 00 p.m. sharp .
okay .
jessica pearson in court .
i haven &apos;t seen that in a while .
i like to get back in the ring from time to time .
so what giant companies are you merging today ?
behemoth steel and global everything ?
that was tuesday .
today , i am here to save a man &apos;s life .
we took over an innocence project case .
innocence project ?
so what &apos;re you trying to do , rehabilitate your firm &apos;s image ?
what i &apos;m trying to do is help a man get justice .
and if doing that helps my firm look good , even better .
fair enough .
how have you been , jeff ?
i &apos;ve been good .
listen , i know we talked about me looking you up
when this whole mess was over , but ...
i want you to know--
it &apos;s okay , jessica .
i understand .
no .
what i mean is , it &apos;s not over .
i &apos;m still in it .
you really are fighting to rehabilitate your image ,
aren &apos;t you ?
i am .
it was good to see you , jessica .
it &apos;s good to see you too , jeff .
what &apos;re you doing here , sean ?
i &apos;m here to protect my star witness .
he &apos;s got his own attorney for that .
i don &apos;t care .
and we &apos;re here for you to get your discovery ,
not lecture me on procedure .
i &apos;m here to demonstrate how mr. allen &apos;s
cross examination &apos;s gonna go ,
now sit the hell down .
mr. allen , what exactly are you getting in return
for your testimony against my client ?
he &apos;s getting immunity for the crimes he committed .
are you gonna answer for him when he &apos;s on the stand , too ?
what were those crimes ?
i gave william sutter inside information
over the course of a decade .
and how , exactly , did you do that ?
when my bank was hired to review a transaction
and i determined it was going through ,
i &apos;d call jill miller
and i &apos;d give her the relevant names of the parties .
jill miller ? i &apos;m confused .
you told the sec
that you were feeding william sutter inside information .
we had an understanding .
understood by who ?
william sutter .
did you ever have a specific conversation with mr. sutter ?
i mean , when was the last time
you were even in the same room ?
jill said that he understood .
bullshit , you can &apos;t testify william understood anything .
it &apos;s called hearsay .
it &apos;s called the truth .
i don &apos;t give a shit what you call it ,
if you don &apos;t have proof , the jury can never hear it .
do you have proof ?
oh , i don &apos;t believe this , you don &apos;t have a paper trail .
i have the phone records .
i mean to sutter .
she &apos;s his goddamn daughter !
yeah , and every murderer has a father , too ,
doesn &apos;t mean they &apos;re in on the crime .
save your metaphors for the trial , harvey .
we don &apos;t need them here .
i don &apos;t need to save anything for trial
because you made a deal with this man for nothing ,
you handed me my best witness ,
and this deposition &apos;s over .
you son of a bitch . how dare you ?
how dare i what , sean ?
defend my own client ?
bullshit , you weren &apos;t trying to defend your client .
you were trying to ruin my case
&apos;cause you &apos;re pissed off about mike .
i sure as hell am .
we had a deal and you broke it .
so now i &apos;m breaking it , too .
well , you know what , harvey ?
i don &apos;t care what you &apos;re breaking ,
&apos;cause phillip allen gets me the daughter
and that gets me right back to sutter .
good , &apos; cause that &apos;s exactly what i &apos;d expect you to do .
oh , i get it .
you weren &apos;t trying to win this thing .
you just wanted to discredit phillip allen
so i &apos;d have no choice but to reinstate mike &apos;s deal .
you &apos;re damn right that &apos;s what i wanted .
so instead of getting mad at me
for doing what you should have done in the first place ,
why don &apos;t you start turning up the heat
so mike can get this goddamn woman
to turn on her father ?
kevin .
oh , good , you &apos;re here .
you can help .
i know you made me promise not to bring this up again--
mike , i told you--
listen to me .
i just talked to harvey .
a man named phillip allen has come forward and he &apos;s gonna--
wait , you talked to harvey ?
listen , this guy cut a deal with cahill .
all right ? that means he knows all about it .
what do you want from me ?
i want you to convince her that this is it .
she has a one @-@ time chance of getting immunity
if she turns on her father now .
how the hell do you even know this cahill guy &apos;ll do that ?
because i know how bad he wants sutter ,
and offering jill a deal is the best way to make that happen .
or he promises her a deal , then takes it away .
and no one &apos;s kissing my kids good night
for the next two years .
harvey wouldn &apos;t let that happen .
he &apos;s william &apos;s lawyer .
he &apos;s not selling out his own client .
you &apos;re his client , too .
only to protect the guy who &apos;s paying his bills .
he doesn &apos;t give a shit about me .
maybe not , but he does give a shit about me !
what &apos;re you-- what &apos;re you saying ?
i &apos;m saying that offering jill a deal
doesn &apos;t just get her out of prison .
it gets me out , too .
you &apos;ve been informing on me , mike ?
yes .
get the hell out of my sight , you traitor piece of shit .
kevin , listen , i &apos;m only telling you this
so that you &apos;ll see--
see what ? how full of shit you are ?
telling me you grew up without a mom and dad
just to gain my trust--
that is not why i did that .
and i just told you the truth
so that you trust that i care about you .
bullshit , &apos; cause here you are ,
willing to leave two little kids all alone
just to get your goddamn freedom .
kevin , i &apos;m sorry--
no , you &apos;re not .
but you &apos;re about to be .
come on , fight ! fight back , you traitor !
fight me back !
you have to listen to me !
come on , fight !
this isn &apos;t done , mike !
get him out of here now !
no , no , no--
get him to solitary now !
no , not solitary ! it &apos;s my fault , it &apos;s my fault !
you don &apos;t have to do this !
ross , ross !
another word , and you &apos;re going to solitary , too .
harvey specter .
you have a call from danbury federal prison .
do you accept the charges ?
yes .
harvey .
mike , good .
i did my part and i took care of phillip allen .
tell me you did yours and got kevin to talk to his wife .
i tried .
instead , i got him put in solitary .
what ? how the hell did that happen ?
i told him i was informing on him
and then he started beating the shit out of me .
are you kidding me ? why would you do that ?
because lying wasn &apos;t getting it done
and i &apos;m living on borrowed time ,
so i thought i might as well tell him , anyway .
then you better figure out a way to get him out of there ,
because we need to get jill to turn on sutter
before cahill gets her to .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m calling you .
i already have a way , i just need to know
you did that other thing you were supposed to do .
i need to know you got gallo his parole hearing .
let &apos;s get to it .
what happened ?
good news .
the court granted our motion .
they pushed your execution back a month .
i don &apos;t believe it .
you convinced my aunt i didn &apos;t kill those people ?
no , leonard , i didn &apos;t .
i don &apos;t understand .
you said that she had to agree to be there for me .
she agreed to sign the papers .
but she &apos;s not gonna come .
goddamn it .
leonard , don &apos;t take your eye off the ball .
this was about buying us time .
take my eye off the ball ?
do you even give a shit about me ?
of course we do .
yeah , i know you do .
but i want to know if she cares
whether i live or die .
i just got your execution pushed back .
that &apos;s not what i asked you .
you didn &apos;t even go see her , did you ?
i have a firm to run .
and only one of us needed to get her signature .
but two of you could &apos;ve helped convince her
that i &apos;m innocent .
don &apos;t you get it ?
the woman who raised me wants nothing to do with me .
leonard , i know you &apos;re disappointed .
but it &apos;s not my job
to repair your relationship with your aunt .
it &apos;s my job to get you out of here .
i ain &apos;t never getting out of here !
don &apos;t you understand that ?
so you go play your game with the courts .
but whether it &apos;s 30 days or 60 days , it doesn &apos;t matter ,
&apos;cause i &apos;m gonna die in here , lady .
the one thing i asked you to do , you didn &apos;t .
you didn &apos;t even care enough to try .
just get out .
you better be here to tell me i have a hearing .
that &apos;s exactly what i &apos;m here to tell you .
but you &apos;re not gonna have anything
unless you do something for me .
bullshit . wasn &apos;t part of the deal .
i don &apos;t give a shit .
i &apos;m tired of you threatening me ,
so if you even want a chance of getting out of here early ,
you &apos;re gonna do something for me .
and by the way ,
it &apos;s too late to tell kevin that i &apos;ve been informing on him .
i already did .
what do you want ?
i need you to get him out of solitary .
you &apos;re kidding me , right ?
i can &apos;t do that
that &apos;s bullshit .
you switched into my cell the first night and ever since ,
you &apos;ve been bragging about everything that you can do in here ,
so how about you stop telling me that you can &apos;t do it ,
and just tell me whether or not you will .
all right , mikey .
i &apos;ll get your ticket to freedom out of solitary for you .
but if you get out of here and i don &apos;t ,
you should know , i can get to you
just as easily out there as i can in here .
and when i say &quot; get to you , &quot;
you got to remember what i did
to make harvey put me away in the first place .
do you want to talk about what happened at the prison ?
no , rachel , i don &apos;t .
because whether leonard believes me or not ,
i really do have a firm to run .
i know you do .
then you know i have ten other things to do
before i get out of here tonight .
then i will leave it alone .
but for what it &apos;s worth , you were there for me
when the victim &apos;s father lashed out at me .
and so ,
if you want to talk about it with someone ,
i just want you to know that i &apos;m here for you , too .
i appreciate that , rachel .
but right now , i &apos;d rather you spend your time
finding something to get leonard bailey out .
i will .
hello ?
hi , jeff , it &apos;s me .
how would you like to have dinner with me tonight ?
i would love to , jessica .
just name the place .
what ?
nothing .
i just haven &apos;t been in this place since i was here with you .
i remembered how much you liked it .
so how come you decided to call me ?
you said you were still in it .
you told me once
that you think maybe things happen for a reason .
you mean running into me today ?
i mean after i ran into you .
i was pretty much accused of being cold ,
heartless , and uncaring .
and i can take it when it &apos;s lawyers saying that about me .
but this was from the man whose life i &apos;m trying to save .
and you wanted to be with someone
who knows a different side of you .
i thought i wanted to be with someone
who knows that &apos;s not a side of me at all .
jessica , i told you i loved you once .
and when i said that ,
i meant that one of the things that i love about you
is your ability to push emotion aside
and knock the shit out of people .
so you think i &apos;m cold , but you love that about me ?
i &apos;m saying that &apos;s one of the things that i love about you .
the other thing is that in your heart ,
you &apos;re not cold at all .
what do you say after dinner , you take me home ?
i say ...
i think that we should take it slow this time .
listen , i know you hate me right now ,
but right this second ,
we are on the same side .
i know .
you do ?
yeah .
&apos;cause they just let me out of solitary ,
and i went to call jill .
i was gonna tell her everything ,
but before i got a chance to do that ...
she told me she was indicted .
kevin , i &apos;m so sorry .
i don &apos;t need sorrys , mike .
i need to find a way to keep my wife out of prison .
then let me help you .
you can help me .
but it can &apos;t be by trying to get her to turn on him ,
because i &apos;m telling you ,
there is no way in hell she &apos;s gonna do that .
you really think she &apos;s willing to go to prison for him , too ?
look , the night i found out about her and her father ,
i asked her how she could have gotten involved
in something like this .
turns out , she found out
his whole place was a ponzi scheme .
she flipped out on him
and he gave her some bullshit sob story
about how the returns were running dry .
he told her that if she got inside information for him ,
one time , it &apos;d keep them from losing eveverything .
and the next thing she knew , it was too late to stop .
yeah , he tricked her .
and when i tried to tell her that ,
get her to quit with me , you know what she said ?
she said she &apos;d never do that .
because no matter what he did with the business ,
she knew he was willing to run into a burning building for her .
so she was willing to do the same for him .
kevin , i need you to let me use your cell phone .
i need you to trust me .
harvey specter &apos;s office .
donna , it &apos;s me .
i need your help and i don &apos;t have much time .
what do you need ?
i think i have a plan to get jill to talk .
mike , shouldn &apos;t you be telling harvey about this ?
i &apos;m calling him next .
but whatever we do , we are not gonna be able
to get her to talk unless you first get her to listen .
hey tara , i know i called four minutes ago
and i know you said 7 : 00 p.m. sharp ,
but now i &apos;m thinking you said 7 : 00 p.m. short .
and i don &apos;t know exactly why that would be ,
uh , but it &apos;s 7 : 12 , and i &apos;m just wondering what--
hello ?
goddamn it .
louis .
i just saw you called two times .
i &apos;m so sorry i &apos;m late .
tara , please .
there &apos;s no need to apologize .
i had them hold the reservation for 15 minutes ,
and it &apos;s only been 13 minutes , so i &apos;m sure it &apos;ll be fine .
thank you , louis .
the litt party is ready .
awesomeness , i &apos;ll have a table for you as soon as one &apos;s ready .
as soon as one &apos;s ready ?
i asked you to hold our reservation for 15 minutes
and it &apos;s only been 13 minutes , you hipster douche bag .
excuse me , sir , is everything okay ?
no , everything is not okay ,
this asshole gave away my table .
hey , man , it &apos;s all good . i &apos;ll get you another table .
&quot; hey , man , &quot; it &apos;s all bad .
i don &apos;t want another table . i want the one i reserved .
so why don &apos;t you tell those people that you gave them
something that belongs to someone else ,
&apos;cause i &apos;m not going to share the most exquisite table
on the planet with another man .
louis .
this isn &apos;t gonna work .
louis--louis . please talk to me .
look , i know i said i &apos;d be okay with this ,
but i &apos;m not okay .
because the whole time i couldn &apos;t reach you ,
i kept thinking that you were on the phone with him
and laughing with him and loving him .
and as long as you have another man ,
i &apos;m always gonna think that you &apos;re with him ,
thinking about him--
louis ? that &apos;s--
let me finish .
you are the most riveting woman i &apos;ve ever met .
you &apos;ve cast a spell on me .
and i would never tell you how to live your life .
but i will not share you with another man .
and i don &apos;t understand why any man would .
i want you , and i want all of you .
but if i can &apos;t have that--
louis ?
take me home .
here , let me help you with that .
oh , would you ?
of course .
us redheads have to stick together .
thank you .
you &apos;re welcome , jill .
who are you ?
i &apos;m the woman who tricked you into going to danbury .
i have nothing to say to you .
please , i came here in person because i don &apos;t want to
trick you again .
then say whatever it is you &apos;re here to say .
i &apos;m here to tell you about my father .
he committed a crime years ago , and before he did ,
he tried to get me to put my toe in the water with him .
i said no , but i almost said yes ,
because i loved him .
and i knew he was a good man .
what do you want from me ?
same thing that i wanted the last time .
i want you to visit your husband in prison tomorrow .
and i want you to keep an open mind .
louis , i knew you were passionate ,
but i had no idea how passionate .
that was magic .
yeah , i take pride in my work .
well , you should .
well , in that case , there &apos;s another show starting
in about 15 minutes .
okay , you know what that means , don &apos;t you ?
you &apos;re gonna be exhausted ,
which means you &apos;re gonna have to spend the night .
well , then what do you say we make the whole day of it , too ?
what exactly do you have in mind ?
there &apos;s a dress rehearsal of the &quot; barber of seville &quot;
at the met tomorrow and i could get us in as patrons .
louis ...
i would love to .
william , we need to talk .
i &apos;m here , just like you asked .
they indicted your daughter .
i know . she told me .
and i told you , you were playing a dangerous game
using her to shield you .
jill &apos;s a big girl .
she can take care of herself .
take care of herself , or take care of you ?
are you accusing me of something ?
i &apos;m not accusing you , i &apos;m telling you ,
you need to wake the hell up .
what did you just say to me ?
do you know what cahill &apos;s gonna do once jill &apos;s arraigned ?
he &apos;s gonna sit her down for as long as it takes
until she cuts a deal to give you up .
she would never do that .
you have no idea what she &apos;ll do when they get her
into that room .
and i &apos;m telling you , if my loser of
a son @-@ in @-@ law didn &apos;t cave , then jill sure as hell won &apos;t .
listen to me , goddamn it .
this isn &apos;t gonna be what it was like it was with kevin .
what do you want from me , harvey ?
i want you to give me authorization
to cut you both a deal .
you turn yourself in , you get maybe three years ,
and you keep her out .
why the hell would i do that ?
because if she turns on you , you &apos;re gonna be getting
a hell of a lot more .
i &apos;m not cutting a deal .
and you think if you &apos;re willing to do this
to your own daughter , she won &apos;t be willing to do it to you ?
jill &apos;s a young woman , i &apos;m an old man .
she does a few years , it hardly makes a dent .
when she gets out , she can still play tennis
and go to pilates and do all the things
i always gave her the money to do .
you knew it might come to this , didn &apos;t you ?
i love my daughter , harvey ,
but she &apos;d be nothing without me .
and she knows if she does this for me ,
she &apos;ll be taken care of for the rest of her life .
so that &apos;s it ? no deal ?
no deal .
i &apos;m sorry , jill .
i want to cut a deal .
are you sure ?
yes .
can you do that for me ?
no , i can &apos;t .
why not ?
because he represents your father .
but i don &apos;t .
so i can .
tara , i didn &apos;t think today could get any better ,
but whatever you did to that water pressure
is thing of beauty . i haven &apos;t felt this fresh
and clean since--
louis , i have to talk to you .
what is it ?
joshua called .
he &apos;s coming to town tomorrow for two days .
but after last night , i thought it was over
between the two of you ?
louis ...
we &apos;ve been together for years . i can &apos;t just not see him .
so you &apos;re gonna break up with him ?
i don &apos;t know .
welcome to danbury , sean .
you know you &apos;re taking a big risk that someone &apos;s gonna
recognize me and figure out that you &apos;re up to something .
well , i &apos;d be taking an even bigger risk
if i didn &apos;t hand this to you personally .
you &apos;re not gonna weasel out of my deal again .
what is this ?
that is an iron clad agreement between your office
and jill miller .
you &apos;re representing jill miller now ?
yes , i am .
does she know that you &apos;re not a lawyer ?
she does .
and she &apos;s okay with it because i &apos;m also the guy
who &apos;s keeping her out of prison .
let me save you the trouble of reading that .
it says that she &apos;s gonna testify against her father ,
pleads no contest , and receives full immunity .
but it also says that you acknowledge that
i brought her to you .
well , then i better bring it to my office and sign it .
oh , and for what it &apos;s worth ,
i didn &apos;t try to weasel out of your deal .
i did everything i could to keep it in place .
well , now it &apos;s back in place .
because i just gave you everything that you need .
no , mike , you didn &apos;t give me everything yet .
because what i still need is william sutter behind bars .
what the hell did you do ?
nice to see you , william . can i get you a drink ?
you think i wouldn &apos;t find out that you recorded me
and played it for my daughter ?
i didn &apos;t play it for her .
i played it for my other client , kevin miller .
jill just happened to be there when i did .
and now she &apos;s turning on me .
then i guess it turns out she didn &apos;t want to wait five years
to play more tennis like you thought .
goddamn it ,
you broke attorney @-@ client privilege .
i didn &apos;t break anything , william .
because like i just told you , kevin &apos;s my client too ,
and i had an obligation to share the facts with him .
so instead of attacking me , you should be thanking me .
because i went to cahill and cut you the best deal
you &apos;re ever gonna get .
why would you do this to me ?
you did this to yourself , william .
you had me represent both you and kevin ,
which means i had to choose between two clients .
and you said it , yourself .
you &apos;re an old man , and they &apos;re a young couple ,
and i chose them over you .
i didn &apos;t have you represent us both .
it was your idea .
i guess it was , wasn &apos;t it ?
you son of a bitch .
you set me up !
and i &apos;m gonna make sure the world knows it .
you can tell the world anything you want , william .
but you &apos;ve got no proof and you &apos;ll be telling it
from behind bars .
either way , i suggest you sign this deal ,
&apos;cause it &apos;s the best you &apos;re ever gonna get .
jessica .
what &apos;re you doing here ?
i had a great time last night .
and i was going to call you about going out again next week
because i know you want to take it slow .
but then i found out that you want to take it slow
because you may not be here much longer .
how &apos;d you find out ?
they called for a reference .
and what &apos;d you tell them ?
i said them they &apos;d be lucky to have you .
thank you .
why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
because i wasn &apos;t sure i was gonna take it .
but now you are .
jessica , if i thought there would be a chance
in the world that you would come with me , i would &apos;ve asked you .
but we both know that &apos;s not gonna happen .
because you told me it &apos;s not over yet ,
but what you meant is that it &apos;s never gonna be over .
it &apos;s my firm , jeff .
it &apos;s the thing i spent my whole life building .
and i &apos;m not judging you for it .
you are who you are ,
and i love who you are .
but i &apos;ve been thinking about going back to chicago
for a long time now , and as much as seeing you again
makes me want to stay here ...
this is something i have to do .
like i said .
they &apos;re lucky to have you .
it &apos;s done .
sutter took the deal .
jill &apos;s safe .
thank god .
i &apos;m , uh ...
i &apos;m sorry that jill had to hear what she heard .
it was the only way , man .
besides , you didn &apos;t say it .
no , but i did know what i was doing
when i agreed to inform on you .
i &apos;m sorry .
you didn &apos;t deserve any of that .
hey , look , when we first met ,
i let gallo in here .
and that was as much a betrayal as what you did to me .
yeah , but you didn &apos;t know me .
i knew you .
what , are you trying to make me hate you ?
no .
it &apos;s just that i &apos;m getting out and you &apos;re not .
no , i &apos;m not .
but you kept my wife out of prison ,
and as far as i &apos;m concerned , that makes us square .
thank you , kevin .
where you going ?
me ?
i &apos;m gonna give you a few minutes to enjoy the fact
that you &apos;re getting out .
and to call rachel and tell her .
donna , i &apos;m on to something .
i just need one second to write it down .
what is it ? what &apos;re you so happy about ?
i think i just figured out a way
to get leonard bailey &apos;s case reopened .
rachel , this is amazing .
come on , get your things .
we can talk about it on the way out .
because we &apos;re going to celebrate .
no , it &apos;s good news , but i &apos;m not ready to celebrate .
yes , you are .
because i &apos;m not talking about your case .
rachel , harvey and mike did it .
mike &apos;s getting out .
what ?
you heard me .
they did it .
sutter &apos;s going away , which means mike &apos;s coming home .
oh , my god .
oh , god .
come on , let &apos;s go have some fun
while you &apos;re still single .
it &apos;s mike .
hello ?
hey , it &apos;s me .
i know it &apos;s you .
it &apos;s over .
i &apos;m coming home .
i just heard .
god , i love you so much .
i love you , too .
