Now from these experiments
A few factors became evident.
One was the realization
That serial killers have been with us
Since the dawn of man.
Please let him go.
Take whatever you want take anything
But please let my son go.
My name is professor James Fallon.
I'm a scientist-- neuroscientist--
And I study the human brain.
It is a complex and sometimes lethal machine.
In a blind experiment colleagues sent me
70 MRI brain scans
And I had no idea who these brains belonged to.
Some were normals some were schizophrenics
And some were killers.
I analyzed all of them
5 of which I determined were the brains of psychopaths.
And it turned out that indeed
These 5 were the brains of serial killers
Some of whom you know.
In studies such as these
One looks at the biological factors...
That is the genetics and also the brain pathology.
The 5 brains we identified
All had damage to the orbital cortex
Which is right above the eyes.
Now high-risk allele of the monoamine oxidase A
The MAOA gene
May also be present in these people
And that's key.
Now under the effects of the high-risk gene
The brain of the psychopath was bathed
In way too much serotonin during fetal development.
As an adult
This brain is now numb
The first dangerous elements are now in place.
The damage is done.
Now this is a recipe for catastrophe.
So when the fetus reaches the day of labor
The potential serial killer is born.
Mom!
Mom!
Hey how was your weekend?
Uh scary yet informative. Was the whole family killed?
Hudson this is Dr. Spencer Reid.
Field Agent Anne Hudson.
The uh father is serving in Iraq.
3 nights ago the cops found his family buried over there.
Buried?
The neighbors heard the dog barking came over
And he was scratching at the grave.
Lucy their oldest child she's still in her swimsuit.
What does the father know?
Some of it. He was on patrol.
Took his unit a couple of days to reach him.
He arrives today.
Last year the Williams family
Was killed and found exactly the same way.
They lived in Newport News.
The father Dan williams was also serving overseas.
Now the police are overwhelmed
And getting serious heat from the military.
We need some answers fast.
As do the media.
They're already calling this the work of a serial killer.
They're right. It is.
But why bury them?
I mean it can't be to hide the bodies.
It's a sign of remorse.
And when they're done being remorseful
This will happen again.
"Man usually avoids attributing cleverness to somebody else
Unless it's an enemy."
Albert Einstein.
No sign of a struggle.
Unsub holds a gun to one of her kids' head.
What can she do?
Footprints belong to Paul.
Somehow he managed to get away.
Mom gets it first then the youngest.
He hides in the master bedroom
The unsub finds him and shoots him.
And carries him out to the backyard.
But not the mother. She's dragged out.
It's quick and proficient.
For the mother and the boys maybe.
But Lucy's drowned and not shot.
Why the change in M.O.?
F-22 raptor.
Yeah. It's about to get way louder and much busier.
Tomorrow is Langley's 50th anniversary air show.
The father of the first family killed--Dan Williams
Where is he now?
He put in for another tour of Iraq.
An I.E.D. Killed him 2 months ago.
Whoever did this
Knew both fathers were serving overseas.
Laura Downey's wedding rings are missing.
Any other valuables?
We'll have to ask the husband.
From the Williams home
Only jewelry and watches were missing.
The unsub only took what he can carry
Which means he's most likely on foot.
There was a photo on the wall in the kitchen.
I'd like to see it.
Sure.
There's no sign of sexual assault
In the Williams case. What about Lucy?
Nothing on the coroner's report.
Multiple suspects?
The mother was dragged out of the house.
If it had been multiple suspects
They probably would have carried her.
He knew the father was absent
Therefore the dominant threat was absent.
So we could be looking for a single suspect.
No sign of forced entry.
No need. Lucy was in the pool
Back door was open. The unsub walked right in.
That means Lucy probably died last.
In both cases the girls were suffocated
And not shot. I don't think it's a coincidence.
Hey Garcia. You're on speaker.
We just got a call
From Virginia Super Max prison.
One of the inmates there
Has received 2 envelopes in the last 2 days.
First envelope had clippings of the Newport News killings.
Second envelope had media clippings of the Downey family.
In the second envelope was a note saying
"Look at what I've done " and both pieces of mail
Have been signed by "an admirer."
Who's the inmate?
That's the part that...
Karl Arnold.
The fox
The fox
He's back.
Ok thanks.
Family annihilator absent father wedding rings.
It's similar.
To what?
4 years ago karl arnold aka the fox
Killed 8 families.
Just like this case he took wedding rings
Only he took them as trophies.
He'd hide in the bushes outside the homes.
And I watched them... For a number of days.
Always at night.
Saw how they lived...
How they loved.
I would keep them apart until the last night.
Then I would bring them one by one
Down to the basement
The youngest first.
The father last.
Why Karl?
So he could see what happens...to families
When the head of household isn't strong.
Wives wither...
Children perish.
So we're working with a copycat here?
It's too early to assume anything.
It could bias the profile.
Not to mention the police the media and the military
would jump all over it.
Until we're positive none of this information leaves the 7 of us.
Hotch you gave evidence at Arnold's trial.
I think you should go see him.
I'd like to take Prentiss with me.
Let's go.
Have Garcia check on all of Arnold's
prison correspondence and visitors for the last 4 years.
Ok.
Captain Joseph Downey has arrived back at the station.
Captain Downey please sit.
Thank you I'm fine.
Tell me everything.
At around 9:30.3 nights ago
Your neighbors called police when...
I'm sorry.
Sir.
We believe it was the work of a serial killer.
I'm sorry. My neighbors uh Jack and Penny...
Captain Downey...
Your family was murdered.
All of them.
Is there someone you'd like us to call?
Uh call um... no no. I uh...
I'd like to go home now.
Captain Downey. Captain Downey. Captain D...
Ok.
Ok.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
So why wait a year to send Karl a note
Unless they were communicating the whole time?
That's the first thing we need to find out.
But Karl has a big ego.
He's gonna want to answer a question with a question.
He's trying to gain the advantage of me by asking
why I'm not wearing my wedding ring.
And then he will turn his attention to you.
So that's why you brought me along.
Your presence will throw him off guard.
Then he's gonna want to describe to you in graphic detail
every sexual act he committed with the families.
To freak me out?
To pull you into his fantasy.
Control open on 16.
Keep your eyes forward.
More than anything he's going to want
to see the images of the children.
We can't give him that.
We have to give him something
or we'll get nothing from him.
Come on!
Isn't that uh...
Garrett Pain. That's reinforced glass.
Easy for you to say. He tore apart 14 women.
Open on 15.
Whoa baby!
Hello Karl.
Agent Hotchner.
I wasn't informed you were bring in a uh...
They just said two agents.
This is agent...
I know all about you.
If this unsub's copying the fox
Then we profile him like the fox.
Karl Arnold worked as a psychologist's assistant right?
Yeah. Which made it easy for him to watch target
And learn about the victims from a distance.
Yeah it also made him hard to find.
Like the fox our man here found a way to hide in plain sight.
But he's pulling from 2 completely different units.
Williams a medic Downey an army captain.
Someone knew of that military connection.
Both families were attacked within a
month of the fathers being deployed.
Gave them time to settle in
get comfortable that the fathers weren't there.
And once inside the home the fox would live with the families
and then become the father.
But not this unsub.
He just walked in and dispensed with the family.
Living with them wasn't part of the fantasy.
Agent Rossi.
The picture you requested.
Thanks to you we pulled some prints off it.
And all the prints were on Lucy.
The bullet hit the father dead center.
The prints match that of the Newport news killings.
It's the same killer.
Family annihilators like the fox they start with one victim.
And once they feel capable
They move on to a second victim.
They don't start with entire families.
There are more victims. We just haven't found them yet.
Karl it appears you have a fan.
Admirer.
Not a fan.
Big difference. Right?
Is this the first time you've
been contacted by your admirer?
I have many fans.
Even my own website.
Don't you?
You'd be astounded at some of the questions they ask.
I make a log of all of them. Would you like to read some?
I would love to.
You'd love to?
Yes.
Here.
Look.
Maybe later.
Your admirer is taking wedding rings just like you.
But maybe not for the same reason.
Like how you took all of mine.
You took mine.
But I see... You lost yours.
8 rings 4 families.
Or was it one ring for each family?
How'd you come to lose your ring?
Wait don't tell me.
A casualty of the job.
My job is what put you in here.
True.
But then it's the children who suffer most. Wouldn't you agree?
You'd know more about that than me.
Which is why you came to me.
I can help you with that agent Hotchner.
I certainly can.
But I'll need to see those photos.
May I?
A word?
Is there a problem Emily?
There's no problem Karl.
We cannot show him these.
These images will be his undoing and our way in.
But they're not just images.
That's exactly what they are.
We can't use Lucy like that.
It's a tradeoff we have to make.
So we are using a dead 12-year-old girl in a bathing suit
as a bargaining chip? For what?
To him it's not just a photograph.
It's much much more and we need to know what.
Look I'm...
I've never done this before.
And you don't have to now.
Yes I do.
All right. When I feel he's ready to talk
I'll leave the room.
You get him talking.
Whatever he does whatever you feel
Just stay on script.
We need to know why he killed those families.
He's had a smattering of visits
A couple of whack jobs contact him
But nothing as direct as this admirer person.
How are we doing on the prints on the picture?
Oh. I'm still running them.
How are you holding up?
Military families they always fear the worst.
They know their men may not return
But this--
To see a father lose so much.
I wish I had something for you.
I truly cannot find a damn thing that connects these families.
Geographically both of them
Are thousands of miles away from their family.
Communication's all they had--
Emails phone calls letters.
But that's military communication.
Even between families
It requires a kind of juice I'm not allowed to use.
Come on. You hacked into the FBI database.
And they gave me a job.
And I like my job.
And I like my life.
All right I'll make some inquiries.
Ok. Do that. Take care.
So Lucy dies last alone.
This by itself doesn't really mean anything
But when we look again at the Williams file
We notice that the majority of the foreign fingerprints
Came from Karen Williams' room
Which means the unsub spent most
of his time in there with Karen.
Then he must have separated her from the rest of the family.
Lucy Downey was already in the pool.
That much was done for the unsub.
Then this unsub is driven by some other kind of compulsion
Some other need.
Hotch was right. This isn't a coincidence.
It's a possible signature.
Sir I know that but two families have died.
No I realize this breaks protocol but--
No all we want is to stop this from happening again.
Sir I promise you agent Garcia is the best we have.
Ok. Thank you.
We need to look at each of the victims as a hub
With lives outside of their own families.
Well each one of them has their own
connections outside the family.
School friends tutors business colleagues.
And each one of these people
Are considered access points back to the family.
That could take weeks.
Well you have time.
From remorse to the desire to kill again
The unsub will go through a gamut of emotions.
Could be another year before unsub feels the desire to kill again.
As horrific as these crimes are
This city doesn't have the resources
to commit that amount of time.
We have full access to all military records for the fathers.
Well now at least
We have access to the main hub between families.
The dads.
All right well let's find out what connects them.
Stand up.
You want to see don't you?
Very much.
We're gonna show you.
This is the home of the Downey family.
There were 3 children.
How old are the children?
12.9 and 4. A girl and two boys.
Where were they found?
Over there.
Buried.
Interesting.
Laura the mother and the two boys were killed in the house.
The daughter?
This is where the mother and the youngest son were killed.
The other boy was shot in the bedroom closet.
Where's the father?
Overseas.
The killer knows this.
He knows everything about this family
And he watches their every move
To be sure he achieves what he needs.
You have no idea how he knows the father is gone
Or how he targets these families
And the how.That's the key.
The how...
Is why he...
Was able to catch me.
You watched the families for days.
Weeks.
I got to know them.
But not your guy. He doesn't need weeks.
If he did he'd stay longer.
Why?
So he can enjoy them.
But what I don't understand--
Is why he didn't separate the children.
Exactly.
That way you have more control. No room for error.
Why he didn't put the boys in separate rooms and say
If you cry...
I'll have to kill mommy.
Tell me...
How did the girl die?
She was drowned.
Yet the others were shot.
May I see her?
What's so special about the girl?
To suffocate her.
To feel the life leave her body
Means everything to the man who did this.
To you maybe but not to this killer.
Not in the same way.
All I did was show them how weak fathers could be.
That's all.
Every child you killed you abused physically.
For this man there is no sexual gratification.
At least I spared the fathers the grief of living.
Please...
Please don't do this.
Come on. Let's get you cleaned up.
Dani! Didn't I tell you to always lock the door!
Nick cleats off!
Dani! where are you?
Dani?
Mom?
Please don't--
Please...
Mom...
The girl was suffocated not shot right?
Yes.
Just like the other two.
Her name is Dani. She's 14.
And the father?
Afghanistan.
Does this rule out remorse?
Yes it does.
So what is it now?
The escalation between kills
Indicates a major psychological break.
How is it escalated?
The timeframe between kills
Has gone from a year to just 3 days.
For the unsub something has dramatically changed.
Some kind of major external stressor forced this unsub
Into feeling the need to kill again without any remorse.
Mirror neurons and stressors
Relating to the unsub's past
May have triggered this
The strongest of which is smell.
That sound.
The Williams were killed a year ago.
Were there any military maneuvers
going on at Langley at that time?
The annual air show but nothing as big as this.
He's killed again hasn't he?
Luckily for me.
Luckily?
Now we're alone.
You stated that the families don't know the killer. Why?
Now we wait right? You and I
See if my...Admirer contacts me.
He will.
Yours was one of the first cases I studied.
Really?
I've been fascinated ever since.
With what?
You.
And now...
You want to know what I did...to the children.
Don't you?
Yes.
I can show you.
I can show you exactly what I did to them.
Tell me.
Children are so precious.
So clean.
But they need guidance.
Especially the girls.
Why?
Girls have much more to lose... than boys.
It's a fact the female body can handle pain much better.
What did you do to them?
I showed them
What men...
Their fathers and brothers...
Are capable of.
And what is that?
You sure you want to know?
Yes.
Morgan if the Langley air show is the stressor
Then Karl's admirer doesn't fit the profile.
A psychopath suffering a major psychological break
Doesn't brag about it Hotch.
There was nothing you could have done
That would have saved that family today.
Well that's if I'm right about the profile.
I think you are.
Karl's admirer doesn't have
anything to do with these killings.
Well either way we need to know who is.
Hotch I want you to stay with him and find out
So we can stop this son of a bitch.
I plan to.
Once I killed the children
It always amazed me
How little...the father fought the inevitable.
Which was what?
Dying.
I'm trolling through the williams' emails
Satellite phone calls land line phone calls
Family photos their life all of it.
What about the Downeys?
They're up next and there's a ton to go through.
Fingerprints Garcia?
Zip.
They're--they-- there's nothing here.
I'm sorry folks.
Garcia widen the search.
Morgan I already did. Vicap combines every database
In this country. We're as wide as we can go.
Abuse can have a long-term effect on any child's brain
But for the abused child who has the high-risk gene
And the orbital cortex damage
The combination is devastating.
All right this air show is military.
These fathers are all soldiers
fighting a war on foreign soil.
We know that none of these graves are a sign of remorse.
Hey guys. Look at these graves.
What are they reminiscent of?
Mass graves.
Exactly. Which would indicate
The unsub experienced early pubescent
3-dimentional mirror neurons
Reflecting events similar to the one they're creating.
I think this unsub was born into conflict.
But where was he born into conflict?
When was the last time we saw anything
like mass graves in the U.S.?
We haven't. Not in our lifetimes.
Not within our borders.
Vicap is national not international.
Garcia international databases?
Interpol is the biggest.
If they did it they're in it.
It's pretty obvious that he's done this before
But the question is where and why.
Karl I never thought that you'd be this honest.
It takes a good woman
To make an honest man.
And anyway let's face it--
She's prettier than you.
Karl do you know why you killed all those families?
I've already told you why.
No you told me how not why.
And the reasons why in this case
Are very different than they were for you.
They're very very different.
And as you so eloquently have been
pointing out to Agent Prentiss
All of your motivations were about sex.
Motivations you learned from your father.
You really have done your research on me
I'm flattered.
You're also filled with feelings
Of extreme self-hatred.
It must be distracting working with someone so beautiful.
You forced those men to watch their children die
And here's why Karl.
Here's why you are what you are.
What I would do to you.
By killing the fathers last
You were killing your own father
And ultimately yourself
Over and over again.
This isn't over agent hotchner.
At least not for you.
Wait Hotch.
For Karl it's all about the fathers.
In this case it's all about the girls.
They die last.
They're laid out last. None of them are shot.
None of them show any signs of sexual motive.
What if we applied that logic to these killings?
That's something we hadn't considered.
Why would we? It's so rare.
What is?
The killer's a woman.
A woman?
I'll let Morgan know.
Karl just now you said
That this wasn't over for me.
What did you mean by that?
He's just getting warmed up.
It's just...
You don't see it.
But you will.
All right we'll work it in right now.
Prentiss thinks the unsub might be a woman.
That's why we couldn't find a sexual motive.
Wherever she's from her father's a military man.
Derek I've got a hit.
Interpol.
2 hits. 3 hits.
3 crime scenes. 3 different cities.
The first--Zagreb 1998.
A woman and her 8-month-old baby are both killed.
And then 2 years later
The same prints show up in Modena Italy
Then 2007 London England young couple both shot.
You were right. She's killed before.
Zagreb is the capital city of Croatia.
Is that significant?
Between 1991 and '95 they fought
A bitter battle for independence.
Serbian forces tried to ethnically cleanse
Over 40.000 Bosnian Muslims.
Then at some point within the last 2 years she moved to America.
She's on the run.
And ran right into a city
Filled with military families.
The only mass graves reminiscent
of the ones the unsubs created
Were found all over Bosnia after the war
But none of them rival that of Srebrenica.
Dutch U.N. forces created a safe haven for refugees.
Then in 1995 Bosnian Serb forces surrounded the town.
A psychopath born in the middle of that conflict--
That's not a good mix.
She's exacting her life experiences onto the victims.
You think this woman was there?
Well think about it. Langley's filling up with civilians
And military vehicles just like Srebrenica.
Can you determine her age?
Based on victimology
Each of these girls is no older than 15.
The Balkan war lasted between '93 and '95
So if the girls represent the unsub
She's somewhere in her late 20s.
How did Srebrenica end?
It was a massacre.
I don't think this woman has anything to do with Karl.
I encouraged him.
I flirted with him.
Made it personal.
Getting intimate with a killer is...
So different.
It's what we do.
Yeah. But...
There's no fixing how I feel right now is there?
No.
But it helped the case.
And you did what you had to.
Agent Hotchner.
Before you go
There's one final thing I'd like to share with you.
Let's just get this over with.
This unsub is armed and suffering
A major psychological break
And she will not hesitate to kill again.
She's white and in her 20s.
We believe she came to the U.S. A few years ago.
She's likely on foot.
She could be Eastern European.
She may speak little to no english.
Now if you manage to apprehend or corner her
Do not underestimate this woman.
She will try to fight her way out.
The Downeys live less than a mile from the Foresters
Which means she's somewhere in this area.
I see something.
Wait.
Wait a minute. Could it be?
They're all connected to the same site.
Every media outlet is being informed
Of the clear and present danger to the public.
Thank you very much.
Ok guys I really have got something.
All of these photos every one of them
Was uploaded to a user website called Photobug.
Photobug?
Yeah. Members can upload photos videos email
Webcam chats. I use it all the time.
Every one of these families extensively used this site
For months even years.
All these family photos were printed by Photobug.
Isn't it protected?
Not from the people who run it.
It's a great way for military families to keep in touch.
And a perfect way to target a family
Without anybody's knowledge.
They outsource work to people all over the country.
So I took your profile
Hacked into their employee database
Came up with this list of potentials
One of which is a match that screams homicidal bitch.
Her name's Miranda Dracar she was an orphan
Born in Sarajevo during 1982.
She was adopted by a family in Srebrenica.
Let's go.
Clear.
Clear.
The Foresters.
Morgan.
The unsub's next victim.
He's a marine.
USMC first battalion engineer.
Jennifer call your contact.
Sir I'm gonna need access to every piece of data
on U.S. Marine sergeant young.
It may save his family.
Why are you always so slow? We're late. Come on.
I am I am.
So you think you found my admirer.
A woman.
No. We found the killer.
With my help of course.
Your admirer is exactly like
everyone who contacts you--lost.
My love your guy is far from lost.
We're done.
So is he.
"look at what I have done."
It's quite brilliant you know?
We will find whoever sent you that.
No agent Hotchner I rather think
He's already found you.
Morgan?
I'm all right.
I'm all right.
Hotch.
Hotch.
I can't believe you can't see what he's doing.
What is going on?
He's torturing him.
Who?
It's great to see you squirm agent hotchner.
Foyet.
