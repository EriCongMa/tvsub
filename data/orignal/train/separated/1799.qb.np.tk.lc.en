i had a bad night and i cried like a girl .
i &apos;m over it . you need to get over it , too .
i &apos;m retaking my intern test .
you and i are more than just roommates .
yeah , we &apos;re friends . i mean , right now , you &apos;re probably
one of my best friends .
best friends .
you &apos;re the only woman i &apos;ve ever kissed .
so you &apos;re freaking out , too ?
a lot of therapy time .
well , derek &apos;s moved in . and we &apos;ve taken it to the next level .
i am happy .
in 6500 b.c. ,
some guy looked at his sick friend and said ,
&quot; i have an idea . why don &apos;t i drill a hole in your skull ?
it &apos;ll make you feel better . &quot;
and thus , surgery was born .
uh , where &apos;s mer ?
she &apos;s not here .
so you &apos;re just in there by yourself ?
i &apos;m not ... i &apos;m ... i &apos;m waiting for her .
oh . love the outfit .
what do you want ?
i need cash .
i ordered a pizza , and alex owes me 20 bucks ,
but he &apos;s not speaking to me because i saw him crying
over his crazy girlfriend .
and there was a minute a week ago
that i actually thought he was gonna be a human being ,
and now he won &apos;t open the door .
run into the bathroom . just go . go !
karev .
give me a $ 20 .
that was so awesome . you &apos;re pretty cool .
not that i didn &apos;t think you were cool before ,
but , you know , i did not .
i kinda just thought you were all hair and , you know . ah .
now , cool . you want to share some pizza ?
it takes a certain brand of crazy
to come up with an idea like drilling into somebody &apos;s skull .
but surgeons have always been a confident bunch .
unh @-@ unh @-@ unh . your clothes , your room .
the living room will not be a dumping ground
like the old place was .
did you not hear her ?
okay . she kinda scares me .
&apos;cause she &apos;s scary .
callie needs a new best friend .
not bad , right ?
it &apos;s great .
we usually know what we &apos;re doing ,
and when we don &apos;t , we still act like we do .
we walk boldly into undiscovered country ,
plant a flag and start ordering people around .
do you want to go on a date with me ?
it &apos;s invigorating and terrifying .
like a &quot; date &quot; date ?
yeah , you know , a restaurant candlelight , bottle of wine--
at the end of the night , i try to take your clothes off ?
ooh . okay , that &apos;s ... that would be a date .
hey . you &apos;re ...
naked and waiting for you .
you keep a diary ?
have i not known that all this time ,
that you keep a diary ?
no , i @-@ i @-@ i don &apos;t .
i , uh--
aw , don &apos;t be shy . i think it &apos;s cute .
it &apos;s not mine .
i won &apos;t read it . whose is it ?
your mother &apos;s .
it was in a big box full of old issues
of &quot; the new england journal of medicine . &quot;
did you read it ?
no .
i brought it up here for you .
why were you going through her things ?
i was trying to find space for my clothes .
your closet is full .
i have to , um , shower .
i &apos;ve been hauling cristina &apos;s boxes .
you haven &apos;t read any of it ?
no , what if i &apos;m in it ?
i don &apos;t want to hear what she thought of me .
i &apos;ve heard enough of that already .
what &apos;s worse , if you &apos;re in it or you &apos;re not in it ?
i don &apos;t know . but i mean , see , why is he in the study
rooting around in closets ...
trying to dig up my mother &apos;s ghost ?
i think &apos; cause you invited him .
apparently some people thought i was kidding last week
when i announced that nobody was going to get to hang out
on their favorite specialty anymore .
i wasn &apos;t . junior residents don &apos;t specialize .
so all the requests to send you back
to that place where your true heart lives can end now .
dr. bailey makes the assignments .
do not , and i repeat , do not harangue her .
look , o &apos;malley , i made a call .
they don &apos;t have your score yet . if i knew , i would tell you .
you passed .
we &apos;re gonna go to joe &apos;s tonight and we &apos;re gonna celebrate .
i &apos;m gonna buy you a beer and all the peanuts you can eat .
what if i didn &apos;t pass ?
well , then i &apos;m still buying you a beer .
beer for losers .
grey , you &apos;re on cardio with hahn today .
oh , but ...
stevens and karev , pit .
oh , come on .
that &apos;s not ... the chief wants us to have a change .
that &apos;s not a change .
i &apos;m always stuck in the pit with alex .
when the chief said don &apos;t harangue dr. bailey ,
what do you think he meant ? yang , clinic .
what ? what ? no .
no . no , no , wait , wait .
the clinic is mine . i say how it &apos;s staffed .
yeah , yeah .
she &apos;ll just ruin it .
yeah , i will . i &apos;ll @-@ i &apos;ll ruin it .
just let me do it .
no , you will not . you will do what i say .
and since yang couldn &apos;t be bothered to show up
at the clinic since it opened ,
think of it as a new frontier in her training .
sorry .
oh , oh , oh , my god . you &apos;re totally not sorry .
you &apos;re psyched . you got hahn . if you &apos;re not , you should be .
well , she &apos;s terrifying . and you have given her
unrealistic expectations as to what a resident should know .
just stay on top of the material , and don &apos;t get
all warm and fuzzy with the patients . she hates that .
okay .
if you have any questions , just come and ask me .
i &apos;ll be in the clinic putting band @-@ aids on stupid whiners
who don &apos;t have the balls to get real injuries .
one through four , let &apos;s go . come on .
i didn &apos;t read the diary .
i just found it and put it on the table .
i would &apos;ve read it .
every time i actually do something
to move into the house , she freaks out .
what are you gonna do with the trailer ?
no .
come on .
this is a very real possibility she kickes me out in a week .
i &apos;m not letting go of the trailer ..
sutures , fecal impaction and more sutures .
she &apos;ll do it .
what do you mean , she &apos;ll do it ?
you &apos;re good at boring , stupid crap .
you &apos;re like a specialist .
hi , i &apos;m dr. stevens .
looks like you need some stitches . what happened ?
i have a cut .
how &apos;d you get it ?
i threw a remote at him , okay ? it &apos;s no big secret .
i threw it at him because all he can do is watch television
or fall asleep like a dead person .
honey
don &apos;t &quot; honey &quot; me . i &apos;m divorcing you .
as soon as you stop bleeding from your head ,
we &apos;re going to a lawyer .
you ever been to europe ?
nope . someday .
don &apos;t wait until you &apos;re retired
and you can &apos;t be bothered to look out the window .
6 @-@ month trip across the world ...
i &apos;ve been waiting for it for 15 years ...
he slept through the whole thing .
marianne ...
six continents .
i worked for 30 years . i was very tired .
well , i &apos;m tired , too ,
of being married to somebody with no interest in the world ,
so everybody &apos;s tired . i &apos;m gonna go get some coffee .
i assume this is going to take forever .
probably .
does your mouth always do that , move to the side like that ?
like what ? huh .
mind if i run some tests ?
whatever you want .
great .
i may be wrong about this , but i think mr. grandy
has a major neuro thing going on .
so get him stitched up and then get him up for a c.t. , okay ?
okay .
oh , give me that .
give it .
mr. grandy , uh , i &apos;m dr. karev ,
and i will be taking you up for your c.t. today .

come on , kiddo , get down .
i &apos;m not doing it .
one , two ...
counting doesn &apos;t work .

three .
i think this is all gonna be okay if we just-- promise me no surgery .
promise me no surgery .
o--i--we--
we can &apos;t really do that .
evacuate . evacuate .
evacuate .
this is an emergency .
evacuate .
do we have this kid under control ,
or do i have to call social services ?
he won &apos;t do anything like that again .
he &apos;d better not . the damn ceiling fell last week .
i don &apos;t need a series of false alarms .
this place looks ridiculous enough already .
keep the ankle biter under control .
i &apos;ll sedate him if i have to .
good , and bone up on your pulmonary autografts .
i don &apos;t want to spend the day bathed in your ignorance
as well as your incompetence .
oh , she hates me .
what do you mean , we &apos;ll sedate him if we have to ?
i was just trying not to be warm and fuzzy .
i don &apos;t mean sedate him , i just mean babysit him .
it &apos;s your last day as an intern .
just think of how happy you &apos;ll be to move on .
i &apos;m gonna be in the o.r. till 7 : 00 .
is 8 : 00 too late for dinner ?
no , but if you need to reschedule or cancel--
come on . are you kidding ?
i made a reservation at canto .
i even gamed out an outfit .
we are doing this .
so hahn is doing a ross procedure ,
and she thinks i &apos;m a moron . well ,
first of all , it &apos;s called a pulmonary autograft
she likes the technical names . okay , tell her you &apos;re excited
to watch her harvest the pulmonary valve
using her septal @-@ sparing technique .
if you cut too much of the septal muscle ,
the patient won &apos;t be able to come off pump . none of that is in the book .
it &apos;s the key to the case . it &apos;ll make you sound like
you &apos;ve been around the block once or twice . perfect .
i can &apos;t believe i am giving you all my best stuff
you totally don &apos;t deserve it . uh , dr . yang .
mrs. borsokowski needs your loving attention .
redness , itching , inflammation--a rash .
you &apos;re giving me a rash ?
no , she &apos;s the mean one . i don &apos;t want her .
o @-@ okay .
all right . what do we got ?
take a look . the thing &apos;s bigger than a baseball .
it &apos;s right behind his eyes .
this should be fun . page stevens .
she left the guy with me .
she gave you the case ?
yeah , well , izzie felt bad for me .
you know , figured this would cheer me up .
in that case , you &apos;re gonna help me pull this thing out .
hey , duncan .
we &apos;re gonna put an i.v. in your arm real quick ,
and then you can go back to your playing , okay ? what is it ?
oh , it &apos;s a little tube we put in your arm . no .
duncan-- no , it &apos;s gonna hurt .
come on , kiddo . it &apos;s not gonna hurt . no , it &apos;s gonna hurt .
it &apos;s a needle . it &apos;s gonna hurt .
but it &apos;s only for , what , three seconds ?
i don &apos;t believe you .
you don &apos;t believe me ?
do you want me to prove it to you ?
i &apos;ll prove it . i &apos;ll have dr . grey put one in me .
this is a tourniquet ,
and , uh , you wrap it around your arm
so that your vein pops out .
see ? like that ?
so now the needle--
that &apos;s the part that &apos;s gonna hurt .
that goes in ,
and that &apos;s--yeah .
hurting . that hurts .
it hurts and ...
it doesn &apos;t hurt any more .
and now that stuff goes into here .
doesn &apos;t hurt at all .
okay , i &apos;ll do it .
okay . then i &apos;ll go get another i.v. kit .
okay . okay .
you &apos;re really good at this .
oh , i was an airplane guy , too , when i was his age .
us airplane guys ,
i think we just like to know how things work .
i &apos;m sorry about the alarm .
i know .
move !
they have the nerve to be indignant
about how they &apos;re not allowed
to be on their specialties anymore .
they don &apos;t have specialties .
they should be grateful they &apos;re even allowed in the--
are you listening to me ?
i &apos;m going on a date with erica hahn .
and , uh , that &apos;s awkward
&apos;cause , uh ...
she &apos;s a colleague and because she &apos;s an attending
and because she &apos;s a she .
and , uh , there &apos;s been kissing ,
but , uh , no touching .
and what if i &apos;m not into it ?
what if i &apos;m horrible
at all that &apos;s tough ... south ...
of the border ?
&apos;cause i &apos;ve never been south of the border
with a female .
i mean , i--i &apos;ve never even been over the , uh ,
northern mountains , you know what i &apos;m saying ?
we &apos;re gonna pretend this didn &apos;t happen .
mr. grandy ? what are you doing in here ?
they admitted me .
my new doctor , dr . karev ,
said i have a huge tumor in my head .
have you seen my wife ?
your new doctor ?
somebody paged me ?
oh , i have a patient with tenderness and erythema
extending from her upper chest to her left arm .
i &apos;m thinking she needs irrigation and debridement .
she said you may have to amputate my arm .
no . that &apos;s a simple rash .
( 以前有个病人得食肉菌 杨总想截肢 )
it &apos;s probably dermatitis . no , no , no , but look how the skin is denuded .
it could be surgical , right ? it &apos;s possible-- it &apos;s
a rash . if it &apos;s dry , wet it . if it &apos;s wet , dry it
go to derm , get a tube of cerave cream ,
and don &apos;t ever page me to hustle a surgery again .
it was supposed to be done yesterday , done .
so exactly why did i walk into my o.r.
and still see a massive , gaping hole
in where the ceiling was supposed to be ?
if you see karev , get an 18 @-@ gauge needle
and shove it in his throat . i have cultivated a look
that says i &apos;m not interested in your personal problems .
can you morons not read that look ,
or have i lost the hang of it ? because people are telling me
a lot of personal problems today .
i don &apos;t give a crap about your crushing workload
or your baffling love life or your carpal tunnel syndrome .
all i care about is mrs . carrucci ,
a 92 @-@ year @-@ old woman who no one can seem to find .
i &apos;m dr . pepman . can i help you ?
where can i get some cerave cream ?
our nurses look like they &apos;re tied up ,
but if you don &apos;t mind waiting , i can get it for you myself .
would you like some water with raspberries while you wait ?
yeah , sure .
chris .
don &apos;t mind chris .
he &apos;s our massage therapist .
your ... uh , what ?
our hands do such delicate work ,
it &apos;s important that they stay healthy .
so we have chris on staff to work on us
when we have a spare moment .
every attending gets their hands massaged at work ?
no .
the dermatology attendings have another therapist .
chris just works on the residents .
you &apos;re a resent ?
first year ,
and loving it .
so i &apos;ll make an incision ear to ear
then peel down the face . and i &apos;ll crack open his forehead ,
pull the tumour right out .
close to his optic nerve .
somebody twitches , and this guy &apos;s blind .
which one of your roommates will be assisting ? karev .
great .
dr. shepherd , i want back on this case . mm @-@ hmm .
this is my patient . alex stole him from me .
remember when i was telling you that-- dr . stevens , let &apos;s be clear .
in this hospital , i am not your roommate .
i don &apos;t give a crap about your personal problems .
i have a resident . i don &apos;t need another one . dr. shepherd .
yes ? patient &apos;s in his room
if you want to go over the procedure with him . great .
you son of a bitch .
go cry to somebody who cares .
this is my case . it isn &apos;t fair .
surgery &apos;s like the wild west .
you didn &apos;t get your claim in montana from the bank .
you got it &apos; cause you put a fence around it
and shot the ass off anyone who walked by .
karev &apos;s a cowboy . you &apos;re not .
we &apos;re gonna transect the great arteries
at the sinotubular ridge ,
use the autograft to replace the aortic root ,
and then attach a pulmonary homograft .
are you going to use the septal @-@ sparing technique
for the pulmonary autograft ? yes , why do you ask ?
well , because if we cut too much of the septal muscle ,
we won &apos;t be able to take the patient off pump , right ?
right .
great . i &apos;ve always wanted to see a septal @-@ sparing technique .
do you know how to reanastomose the coronary arteries
back on to the aorta ? i do .
well , i &apos;ll let you sew part of it in .
gonna be in there . might as well get your hands dirty .
great . thanks , dr . hahn .
you &apos;re going to hell &apos; cause you &apos;re a liar .
was it obvious ?
unfortunately , no .
what ?
what happened ? look .
you paged me 9 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 .
i &apos;m in the middle of studying for hahn &apos;s pulmonary autograft ,
and i don &apos;t see an emergency . no , no , no .
they &apos;re residents .
that one ... baked a 7 @-@ layer cake
for that one &apos;s birthday , from scratch .
oh , and that one , that one &apos;s , uh , girlfriend ...
is taking him skiing this weekend .
oh , but this one &apos;s the best .
okay , this one gets to leave to go get a facial .
and she told her attending , and her attending was happy
&apos;cause they have to have facials .
they &apos;re dermatologists .
i mean ... oh , my god .
the hospital has hired someone to rub them ...
full @-@ time .
i bet their boyfriends don &apos;t go digging around
in their closets without asking . never .
ooh . i told hahn i knew how to do
a coronary artery reanastomosis .
you don &apos;t .
i know . i looked it up , but the kid &apos;s 8 .
he &apos;s got tiny little arteries . okay , you know what ?
um , snag me some of those grapes there ,
and i &apos;ll teach you .
oh , and then find dr . daisy pepman .
ask her for a suture kit and a 7 @-@ 0 polypropylene . dr. daisy pepman ?
she &apos;s a resident . she pours fruity drinks .
&apos;cause she has time for that kind of thing .
and i like saying her name .
so is that hyphenated , or did her parents
name her daisy-- no , no . hey , no--no mocking
there is no mocking in derm ...
only warmth and light .
you all right mrs paley ?
you want to know what duncan &apos;s doing ?
packing to leave
and i can &apos;t stop him
i suck at this
i &apos;m tired and i &apos;m fried

how to be the mom of a kid with heart failure
nobody teaches that

we just need to up our game a little bit can i try ?
oh go for it
a base ball ?
which is why you were so lethargic .
why slept through most of our trip breath ?

you were supposed to give me the benefit of the doubt , not throw electronics at me .
mrs grandy , this is a massive tumour
and the area is hard to reach.and we want to talk about this to your wife .

60 % of her skin sloughed off i &apos;m surprised she didn &apos;t crash
when she got out of bed this morning dr sloan didn &apos;t catch it
when he was down here for a consult ?
oh he may have been distracted by the fact
i told him it was necrotizing fasciitis
that would do it

isn &apos;t gonna help matters o &apos;malley
dr hahn has a thorascopic lung resection in an hour
three tiny incisions no blood nothing scary and what &apos;s that gonna do ?
it &apos;s gonna show him the room the people the instruments
someone under anesthesia who &apos;s still alive .
pinning him down and doping him up is
it &apos;s gonna be traumatic for him and it &apos;s
showing him how it works is such an easy fix
you can &apos;t see can you ?
nope
i don &apos;t want to go in there
scared ?
well there &apos;s not gonna be any blood
nothing gross nothing scary
it &apos;s just three tiny cuts
that are so small you can barely see them
the first time that i went in there
in that room i was scared
but that room
is the most magical room in the world
only the finest doctors get to go in there
and a lot of the great ones
they &apos;re not even allowed to touch anything
they can just watch
i &apos;m pretty good so i &apos;m still a watcher
the people that work in there , they &apos;re just
they &apos;re the best the very best
it &apos;s the safest place you &apos;ll ever be in
in your entire life

you can tell dr. yang
she &apos;s a better teacher than i would &apos;ve thought .
sorry .
save it .
if your colleagues know more than you do ,
milk &apos; em for all they &apos;re worth .
but you lie to me again about your experience ,
and the next heart you see will be your own
as i cut it out of your chest with a steak knife .
mrs. grandy ?
your husband is in recovery .
it was a tough procedure ,
but overall , it went really well .
he &apos;s gonna be okay , mrs. grandy .
he is never gonna forgive me .
he was sick , and i told him he was lazy and boring .
he was sick . you didn &apos;t know .
well , i &apos;m his wife . i should &apos;ve known .
he was ...
people are terrible to the people they love sometimes .
they &apos;re mean .
you were both going through a really hard time ,
and you took it out on one another .
it isn &apos;t fun , but it is what people do .
that doesn &apos;t make you the worst wife in the world .
it just makes you ... a person who made a mistake .
i miss anything good ?
you &apos;re gonna love is .
the redhead just gave the short one a case
because she thought he &apos;d find it interesting--
we could transfer maybe we &apos;d be happier
we &apos;d die of boredom
we &apos;d die with great skin hmm
i had the biggest derm emergency
that exists today ,
and it was fun for about a minute ,
&apos;cause a woman almost died , but then we saved her .
and all she needed was a stupid biopsy i tore a guy &apos;s face off
i reattached a coronary artery
i hate you both
we are not happy , glowy people
yeah
we gotta get outta here
yeah yeah

hey joe can i get another vodka tonic ?
george passed his exam
tool
ah just the people i was looking for
joe i want to buy these two a drink . you are the best roommate ever .
i am just to be clear
you two ever pull that crap on one of my cases again ,
i will have you thrown out of the program
you know what joe ?
i &apos;ll just take my drink at the table
i @-@ i know okay ? i know i &apos;m being an ass
i can &apos;t help it .
i &apos;m pissed off all the time , so much , i can &apos;t even breathe .
but you can &apos;t be pissed at a crazy chick
for losing her mind ,
so there &apos;s nobody else to be pissed at except you .
nobody else
we need to have rules
what ?
rules we--we need rules
about how we &apos;re gonna deal with the motherland .
because it &apos;s undiscovered country
and maybe
maybe it &apos;ll be the best vacation
either of us has ever had ,
but it &apos;s mysterious
and dark
and there should be rules
oh and and an embassy
and a safe word .
i &apos;m sorry .
what the hell are you talking about ?
below the
below the mason @-@ dixon line
of your pants
i &apos;m not sure i &apos;m ready to go there
me neither
there &apos;s lots of undiscovered territory
above the belt .
uh , we can take it slow .
maybe ... just ...
first base ?
okay .
whew . okay . thank you .
sorry .
here , finish my wine .
i &apos;m gonna look at the menu
while you let your blood pressure drop back down to normal .
erica .
maybe second base , too .
i could always move back to the trailer .
no , i want you here .
i mean , i may not always be so graceful about it ,
but ... i want you here .
you need a place for your things .
it &apos;s not an unreasonable request .
you can use this as your den or your office or whatever .
it &apos;s your mom &apos;s den .
but she isn &apos;t here .
you are .
what about you ?
you need someplace ,
someplace you can get away to .
well , i can always go to cristina &apos;s or whatever .
i think i have a better idea .
we like to think we &apos;re fearless ,
eager to explore unknown lands and soak up new experiences ,
but the fact is , we &apos;re always terrified .
maybe the terror is part of the attraction .
some people go to horror movies .
we cut things open , dive into dark waters .
&quot; october 13 , 1977 .
i haven &apos;t slept in three days . &quot;
and at the end of the day ,
isn &apos;t that what you &apos;d rather hear about
if you &apos;ve got one drink and one friend and 45 minutes ?
smooth rides make for boring stories .
a little calamity ... that &apos;s worth talking about .
