they want me in d.c. ?
the job &apos;s yours .
i can &apos;t leave until i know the whole truth ,
until i really know
what happened to david siegel that day .
i &apos;d like to request a book for study .
mosconi claimed that the greatest wealth in the world
was within its pages .
you &apos;re gonna steal it for me .
there &apos;s something you should know about me .
i &apos;m not an fbi agent . i &apos;m a criminal informant .
all the pages held hidden symbols ,
culminating with a picture of an idol .
this is the idol of sita .
the idol had eyes made out of rare diamonds .
the hope diamond-- we &apos;re looking for its twin .
it &apos;s a forgery . it &apos;s a good one .
the initials c.h.-- curtis hagen .
we &apos;re going after the dutchman again .
hagen .
i found this in hagen &apos;s wallet .
hagen was watching someone all day and taking notes .
it could be whoever shot him .
that &apos;s the same block where we found siegel &apos;s body .
neal , who &apos;s listed in apartment three ?
wait . electronic trip wire .
someone has been studying you .
not just me .
this is everyone who &apos;s in my division .
whoever murdered siegel also framed hagen .
probably killed him as well .
this is rebecca &apos;s apartment .
who is she , neal ?
let me guess-- she never invited you over .
it &apos;s outside my radius .
i bet that &apos;s why she chose it . who is this woman ?
i have no idea .
we have to leave , right now .
she doesn &apos;t know we were here , and we need to keep it that way .
i &apos;m staying here .
and then what , you &apos;ll confront her ,
convince her to tell you everything ?
or you could bring her in , question her .
on what grounds ?
i don &apos;t have a warrant or hard evidence .
we don &apos;t know what we &apos;re dealing with here .
we leave , regroup , and figure out what to do .
siegel died six blocks from here .
somehow , he must have been onto rebecca .
talk , now .
i told you--
hagen was threatening her .
at least i thought he was .
instead , he was working with her .
siegel must have found out about it and followed her here .
she sees siegel , realizes her cover &apos;s blown ,
shoots him on the way back to his car .
she killed him .
neal , we will not let her get away with this ,
but you need to tell me everything .
i mean everything .
hagen was looking for a lost treasure
that mosconi hid a hundred years ago .
the same mosconi from the gershon exhibit ?
where i met rebecca .
i approached her for information on mosconi ...
exactly like hagen wanted me to .
they played me from the start .
what &apos;s so valuable that they went through all this ?
the lost twin to the hope diamond .
the motion detector at the door
is an electronic trip wire .
it &apos;s a custom job , from all appearances .
the windows are wired too . it &apos;s professional work .
we don &apos;t know much about this woman ,
rebecca lowe ,
but as of now , she &apos;s the prime suspect
in the murders of curtis hagen and agent david siegel .
neal , you want to give us a minute ?
i &apos;m fine .
come on , caffrey ,
grab a cup of coffee with me .
she was my girlfriend , all right ?
peter , i appreciate you trying to protect me ,
but i can handle this .
i know what you &apos;re thinking ,
and i want you to stay away from this .
you said it yourself-- she can &apos;t know we were there .
if i don &apos;t act like everything &apos;s normal ,
she &apos;ll get suspicious .
okay , but we use it to our advantage .
while you &apos;re keeping her occupied ,
we &apos;ll search her home .
she was so sweet and thoughtful ...
so normal .
we were supposed to go shopping next week .
well , it &apos;s safe to say that &apos;s canceled .
i kind of feel duped , and i barely know her .
i can only imagine what neal must be feeling .
i &apos;m just worried whether he can keep up appearances .
don &apos;t you feel bad for him ?
i do , but ...
he lied to her about who he was too .
you know , hon , you should be a little more understanding .
you know , what i understand is that a life of lies
catches up to you , and it did for neal .
hey , find anything ?
oh , a dusty earring behind your dresser ,
predating rebecca , but no bugs .
cubic zirconia--
could explain the lack of follow @-@ up .
as oscar wilde said ,
&quot; a woman &apos;s face is her work of fiction . &quot;
well , everything about her was fiction , moz .
if it &apos;s any consolation ,
i didn &apos;t see it coming , and i vetted her .
that worked out well .
she had us all fooled , and that &apos;s not easy to do .
the truth is ...
i was excited about someone for the first time in a while .
i know you cared about her .
i cared about the person she pretended to be .
if only it were that easy .
it has to be .
we &apos;re having lunch tomorrow
while the f.b.i raids her apartment .
if rebecca killed hagen , there &apos;s a chance--
that she has the blackmail video , yeah .
rebecca .
this is unexpected .
i couldn &apos;t wait until lunch .
hope you don &apos;t mind .
why would i ?
what &apos;s the surprise ?
for my hero .
nothing says &quot; thanks for saving my life &quot;
like vanilla bombolini .
you okay ?
no , i &apos;m not .
i shouldn &apos;t have left you alone yesterday ,
after everything you went through .
it &apos;s okay . really , i ...
i needed some time alone .
well , i should have been there .
but no time like the present to make up for it .
what are you doing ?
calling the f.b.i ...
to let &apos; em know i &apos;ll be late .
morning .
hang on , hang on , hang on .
neal , talk to me .
morning , peter .
what &apos;s wrong ?
listen ...
i &apos;m gonna be a little late . rebecca &apos;s not feeling well .
i &apos;m gonna make her some chicken soup .
she &apos;s there now ?
okay , you caught me .
i ordered it from 2nd avenue deli .
are you okay ?
oh , peter says hi . - feel better .
uh , tell him i say hi .
rebecca says hi .
we &apos;ll head to her place now .
i see i &apos;ve come down with something .
it &apos;ll buy us a little time together .
you are an awfully good liar , mr. caffrey .
should i be worried ?
no more lies . i promise .
with that in mind ,
there &apos;s something you should know .
what &apos;s that ?
curtis hagen , the man who kidnapped you--
he &apos;s dead .
what happened ?
he was shot by a sniper , killed instantly .
that &apos;s horrible .
he did kidnap you .
still , no one deserves that .
any idea who shot him ?
i was hoping you could tell me .
did you see who was holding you ?
they might have been involved .
no .
he only spoke once or twice ,
his voice was muffled , he wore a mask .
i &apos;m sorry .
what ?
just admiring you .
it &apos;s impressive how well you &apos;ve handled everything .
peter , do you want us to scan all the rare @-@ book research ?
i mean , she &apos;s got drawers of it .
yeah , photocopy and replace everything .
she has an entire folder on neal &apos;s childhood .
i mean , we don &apos;t even have that kind of intel on him .
make an extra copy .
yeah .
i know you had to destroy the codex ,
but yesterday you said there was still a way .
what did you mean by that ?
i shouldn &apos;t have said anything . i ...
i can &apos;t involve you in it anymore .
neal , this all leads to the twin of the hope diamond .
we can &apos;t stop now . we &apos;re so close to finding it .
you were kidnapped because of the codex .
i can &apos;t let that happen again .
this can &apos;t be halfway .
we can &apos;t be halfway .
if i &apos;m gonna be in your life ,
it has to include this part of it .
well , then maybe it &apos;s time i step
away from that part of my life .
what ?
come on , you don &apos;t actually think you could do that .
if it came to that ...
to us ...
yeah , i could .
i got to say-- it &apos;s kind of weird seeing my life
summed up in a file .
and , damn , she is thorough .
anything you want to admit to before it goes into evidence ?
there &apos;s nothing illegal about having
three different profiles on okcupid , all right ?
this has gone too far .
what &apos;d you find ?
i &apos;ve got to get my wife out of the city .
正门
i have to go .
what &apos;s wrong ?
i forgot a doctor &apos;s appointment .
i &apos;m sorry .
wait .
we need to finish talking about this .
oh , we will . um , dinner ? tomorrow ?
rebecca--
yeah ?
i think i &apos;m falling in love with you .
neal , i @-@ i @-@ i don &apos;t know what to say .
you don &apos;t-- you don &apos;t have to say anything .
i just-- i needed you to know .
dinner ...
tomorrow .
yeah , i &apos;ll see you then .
bye .
you sure you don &apos;t want to stay ?
i can &apos;t .
that one goes on the top file .
how much time do we have ?
not much . she &apos;s on her way there now .
i stalled her as long as i could .
someone tripped the sensor . meet me back at the office .
almost done-- ten more minutes .
make it five .
be right back .
where you going ?
i saw a chinese place down the street .
gonna check out their menu .
外卖菜单
外卖菜单
正门
good . you &apos;re here .
you guys were able to set everything up on time ?
yep , we have full video and audio of her apartment .
just in time to watch her pack .
you think she &apos;s onto us ?
no , my menu trick worked .
she hasn &apos;t looked for bugs or cameras ,
so i don &apos;t think she knows we were there .
she &apos;s calling someone .
let it go to voice mail . jones , turn up the volume .
peter--
we &apos;re gonna hear it eventually .
hey , neal , it &apos;s me .
um , look , i &apos;ve been thinking
a lot about what we talked about earlier ,
what you said to me , and , um ...
i love you too .
i can &apos;t believe i just said that into your voice mail .
i--
i guess i just couldn &apos;t wait to tell you .
okay , i &apos;m gonna hang up before i embarrass myself worse ,
but , um , i &apos;ll see you tomorrow .
so you told her you loved her ?
i had to buy you guys some time .
the question is , what angle is she playing ?
that &apos;s why she was packing .
you think she &apos;s moving on to her next target ?
i think you &apos;re the only target she cares about .
yeah , she &apos;s packing up everything
from before she became rebecca .
because she wants to stay as rebecca .
neal , i think she meant what she said .
she &apos;s in love with you .
she profiled my exes to
handcraft a persona i would fall for ...
building the perfect girlfriend .
i think she built it a little too well--
fell for her own con .
you really think she would have thrown it all away
and settled down with me ?
it explains why hagen turned on her .
he lost control .
and it also explains why she turned on him .
maybe she got a read on me and decided to play along .
okay , let &apos;s assume you &apos;re right .
what reason would she have for telling you she loves you ?
keep me around , help with the diamond .
it &apos;s a possibility , and in that case ,
she still has no idea we &apos;re onto her .
or i &apos;m right , and she means it ,
and we can use it against her .
you know , your relationships
aren &apos;t the only ones that are under her microscope .
you have to get elizabeth out of town .
already did-
sent her to bruce &apos;s in washington
until it &apos;s settled .
so let &apos;s settle it .
what are you thinking ?
if she &apos;s fallen for you or not , she needs you .
we know that much .
so let &apos;s see what she does
when we threaten to take you away .
thanks for coming in on such short notice .
i , uh--i hope we didn &apos;t mess up your day .
there &apos;s not much to mess with . i still don &apos;t have a job .
oh , well , i bet you &apos;re wondering why you &apos;re here .
i &apos;m assuming it has something to do
with the gershon museum robbery .
is there new information ?
this isn &apos;t about the museum .
oh . now i &apos;m wondering why i &apos;m here .
it &apos;s about neal caffrey .
what about him ?
we have reason to believe
that he &apos;s been engaged in illegal activities
behind our back for some time now .
what kind of illegal activities ?
does this man look familiar to you ?
n @-@ no , who is he ?
his name is curtis hagen .
has neal ever mentioned that name ?
i don &apos;t believe so . why ?
he was murdered yesterday .
neal caffrey is our prime suspect .
you see what she just did ?
pretended not to know hagen ?
her fake concern
to the news that i &apos;m a murder suspect .
nah , looked like real concern to me .
it was real , but it wasn &apos;t for me .
it &apos;s almost impossible not to react
to unpredictable news in some way .
a good con knows how to turn those tells into an advantage .
you play poker ?
ah , i host the occasional friday night game .
you &apos;ll never be invited , no offense .
in poker , it &apos;s too obvious to act calm
when you &apos;re nervous .
but when you see that fourth ace drop ...
the blood pressure spikes .
yeah .
a good player knows you can &apos;t control that ,
but you can hide its meaning .
she &apos;s hiding her own concern of getting caught
by acting concerned about me .
or maybe you want her to be lying .
i mean , it would be easier , wouldn &apos;t it ?
neal isn &apos;t here today , is he ?
no , we assigned him to another case across town
so that we have the opportunity
to interview his known acquaintances .
i &apos;m--i &apos;m sorry , this is just a lot to process .
i know neal . he &apos;s not a murderer .
no , no , he wouldn &apos;t get his own hands dirty ,
but he &apos;s not above hiring others .
there &apos;s a lot you don &apos;t know about neal caffrey .
he &apos;s told me about his criminal past ,
but he says that &apos;s all behind him now .
he says that a lot .
neal had a history with this man .
he also had a strong motive to want him dead .
which is ?
i &apos;m afraid i can &apos;t say .
so what am i supposed to do ?
if i were you , i &apos;d keep my distance .
i think that went well .
she should consider a second career on broadway .
yeah , so should you , peter .
i think i sold a complete distrust of neal pretty well .
all right , we showed our hand .
there &apos;s no way she &apos;s sticking around
after the fbi calls her in about a murder she committed .
she &apos;s gonna run .
unless she has a reason to stay .
it &apos;s her . madison square park , one hour .
i &apos;ll assemble the team .
all agents maintain position until my word .
rebecca &apos;s in the park now , sending caffrey .
hey . i got here as fast as i could .
you okay ?
walk with me .
how &apos;s the audio ?
five by five .
as long as neal keeps the pen pointed in the right direction .
rebecca , what &apos;s going on ? you &apos;re starting to worry me .
i was called into the fbi this morning .
what ?
they were asking about hagen .
neal , i had to warn you .
they think you hired someone to kill him .
me ? that &apos;s insane . that ...
i didn &apos;t do it . you have to believe me .
what are you gonna do ?
i have to run .
he &apos;s good .
two can play at that game .
run ? neal , there has to be another way .
the feds could have followed you here , all right ?
they didn &apos;t . i made sure of it .
you wouldn &apos;t know it if they ...
trust me , i would .
i can &apos;t trust anyone right now .
look , i hate to say it , but this is good @-@ bye .
i can go with you .
living on the run isn &apos;t a life for someone like you .
you &apos;re not that kind of girl .
maybe i &apos;m not the girl you think i am .
neal , there &apos;s something that i have to tell you ...
about who i really am .
something &apos;s wrong .
let &apos;s see if caffrey can save it .
that &apos;s what all this is about , isn &apos;t it ?
i have to hand it to you -- almost worked .
what are you talking about ?
letting me make the decision to come clean to you --
that was very clever .
rebecca , you &apos;re not making any sense right now . what --
i didn &apos;t see the feds earlier . i must be slipping .
if there are feds here , they &apos;re here for me .
they think i &apos;m the one who killed hagen , come on .
there &apos;s no more point in lying , neal .
we &apos;ve been made . we got to grab her .
but we don &apos;t have anything on her .
if we don &apos;t go , she &apos;s gonna run .
you &apos;re right .
on my signal .
let &apos;s start telling the truth .
did you kill siegel ?
where &apos;s my diamond ?
tell me if you killed siegel , i &apos;ll give you the location .
we &apos;re done playing games , neal .
i was gonna give everything up for you .
i don &apos;t know what i was thinking .
jones , cut her off . move in now . move in .
come here !
go ! go ! i got him .
all agents head towards north exit !
suspect headed west on fifth !
all units , subject heading south
on fifth avenue in taxi number 86z5 .
we &apos;ve coordinated with nypd and state police .
all eyes are on train stations , buses , airports .
there is no way she &apos;s leaving this island .
we need to go back to her apartment .
we made copies of everything there .
but we only had time for a quick search .
we looked in the bag she dropped .
nothing in it but a burner phone and some cash .
where are we on the cab ?
we got the license number ,
but it was already found . ditched on 13th and broadway .
check all traffic cams and surveillance within a half mile .
already on it .
now that our cover is blown ,
let &apos;s tear her apartment apart .
maybe we can find something that tells us
who we &apos;re dealing with .
excellent .
pull up all the floorboards
and check for any hollow spots on the ceiling .
make sure you take the back off ,
check between the cardboard backing and the picture .
talked to the landlord .
said she was a loner -- never had anyone over .
any references ?
he didn &apos;t bother to check .
she paid six months cash up front .
six months .
she even knew how long it would take .
you think i deserve this , don &apos;t you ?
no one deserves this .
i always prided myself
on being one step ahead of everyone .
always the con man , never the con .
look how far it &apos;s gotten me .
maybe there &apos;s a lesson to be learned in that .
shot fired ! everybody down !
peter ?
yeah ?
we scoured the area-- so far , no sign of her ,
but we &apos;ve got units canvassing the neighborhood .
what about where the shot came from ?
it looks like a rooftop from across the way .
she didn &apos;t leave anything behind .
how is he ?
he &apos;s all right . keep looking .
well ?
i &apos;m fine .
this is unnecessary .
just sit still .
she ruined my jacket .
yeah , and we &apos;re gonna make her pay for that ,
but you &apos;re going home .
i told you , i &apos;m fine .
she shot you .
she shot at me .
she hit hagen square in the heart .
she doesn &apos;t miss .
if she wanted to kill me , i &apos;d be dead .
fine . it was a warning shot ,
and i &apos;m taking the warning .
why take the shot in that moment ?
maybe you looked especially smug .
or maybe we were close to something
she didn &apos;t want us to find .
you had just finished searching this area .
about to turn ...
the radiator isn &apos;t an ideal place to hide something .
once the winter comes , everything inside it would be destroyed .
but she only paid for six months .
she wasn &apos;t planning on seeing the winter .
there &apos;s a seam here .
it &apos;s her go @-@ bag .
with this , she could go anywhere .
without it , she &apos;s stuck .
we &apos;ve got her trapped .
jones is running every alias we have on her through the system .
i &apos;m hopeful something will ping ,
give us some clues to who she is .
you don &apos;t seem very optimistic .
we still can &apos;t prove she took a shot at you ,
and we didn &apos;t get a confession at the park .
the most we can get on her is stalking
and possession of fake i.d.s.
we need more proof
than siegel &apos;s cooper 3 connection .
that &apos;s true .
he was standing outside her building .
then he walked to his car ,
where she got a jump on him .
yeah , she tossed siegel &apos;s gun and badge in the trash ,
but she wouldn &apos;t be so careless with her own gun .
what &apos;s the best way to get rid of it ?
drop the gun in the river .
but it &apos;d take 30 minutes to get there by foot .
that &apos;s too far to carry a weapon
that could get her life behind bars .
mm , she wouldn &apos;t have hailed a cab--too close to the scene .
on the video , she was headed north .
towards her home .
did you find any equipment that could have melted the gun down ?
unless you count her hot plate , no .
all right .
so either she ditched the gun in the sewer grate
and kept moving ...
we checked all of them .
or she went home , waited for the heat to die down ,
then disposed of it .
eh , it could be anywhere .
what ?
it was raining the day siegel died , right ?
right .
what ?
what if she hid it somewhere where it would never be found ?
this is dappled .
the day this was set , it was raining .
she could &apos;ve tossed the gun in here , smoothed it over ,
and no one would ever know .
construction should have been done months ago .
i never would have thought of it .
thank god for bureaucracy .
x @-@ rays showed something metal ,
but with all that rebar in there ,
it &apos;s hard to tell what it is .
let &apos;s hope you &apos;re right .
otherwise , the city &apos;s gonna be pretty pissed at you .
the ballistics were a match ,
and we found a fingerprint on one of the bullets inside .
it matched rebecca &apos;s .
now we just have to find her .
well , we &apos;re one step closer . one of her passports pinged .
with who ?
mi5 . i sent you the file .
mi5 is serious business . how &apos;d she get on their radar ?
she was one of their agents .
her real name is rachel turner .
her father was american colonel in the u.s. army .
her mother was british .
she moved around her whole life ,
constantly uprooted , starting over ,
never learned to form attachments ,
but got very good at faking them .
she was a perfect shot ,
great at developing underground contacts .
turns out she used those contacts
to sell confidential information .
that &apos;s when she went underground .
every time they get close to her ,
she reinvents herself and disappears .
not this time .
you were right .
i &apos;m not sure about what , but i like to hear that .
rebecca fell in love with me .
yeah .
it should be comforting .
it means what we had was somehow still real .
but it &apos;s not .
i wanted it to be .
and she &apos;s a murderer .
you didn &apos;t know who she really was .
if i &apos;m the only thing she &apos;s staying for ,
let &apos;s use it .
no . i &apos;m not using you as bait .
you already did .
when she didn &apos;t know the truth .
now she does , and need i remind you , she shot at you .
i &apos;m still here .
let &apos;s keep it that way .
go home , neal .
i &apos;ll call you if i hear anything .
hey , this is rebecca .
sorry i missed your call .
leave a message .
i know you have hagen &apos;s blackmail on me ,
and i have something you want--
the location of the diamond .
let &apos;s talk .
this is ridiculous .
indian food is traditionally enjoyed on the floor .
i &apos;m not gonna hide in my own home .
you have an ex with a sniper rifle , neal .
bare minimum--we have to stay low and avoid windows ,
which is no easy task with this open @-@ concept design .
i offered her a trade--
the location of the diamond
in exchange for hagen &apos;s blackmail video .
we don &apos;t have the location , neal .
what we have is a nearly indecipherable equation
locked up in the steel trap of my mind .
but she doesn &apos;t know that .
hand me the gobi . i &apos;m stress @-@ eating .
it was the only way to draw her out .
so best @-@ case scenario--
you meet with her , she brings the video .
the feds show up , arrest her , and find the video .
all the blackmail hagen has on me is exposed ,
and i go back to jail .
that &apos;s the best @-@ case scenario .
worst @-@ case--she discovers i don &apos;t know the location ,
realizes i &apos;m trying to pull one over on her ...
and i find myself reciting proust over your grave .
looks like i need to find a third scenario .
yeah .
should i be brushing up on my proust ?
no f.b.i outside ?
you know i don &apos;t want the bureau
to get ahold of that video .
regardless , as long as you &apos;re on that anklet ,
i &apos;d rather not linger .
where &apos;s my diamond ?
location &apos;s in here .
your turn .
giving up millions and millions of dollars
for this one little video .
you must really want it .
looks like we both got what we wanted .
come with me . let &apos;s get the diamond together .
why would i do that ?
because you want to be with me ,
and you know i want the same thing .
i know you want that diamond .
it stopped being just about the diamond a long time ago .
we can have everything we want .
there &apos;s nothing in our way anymore .
except that i can &apos;t possibly believe you .
take it .
i don &apos;t care anymore .
just come with me .
the f.b.i is on the way .
you called the feds ?
you killed my new handler .
don &apos;t make me do this , neal .
too late .
it &apos;s over .
you &apos;re an idiot .
we could have had everything .
it wouldn &apos;t have been real .
you &apos;re a con man .
you could have convinced yourself ,
but instead , you choose to stay shackled .
and yet , still freer than you . -
you &apos;re always running from one identity to the next
because you can &apos;t face the truth .
what &apos;s that ?
that you hate who you really are .
and i can see why .
you know me so well ,
you know i never turn up without a way out .
actually , there are three ways out--
through the south window or one of two doors .
you &apos;ve always underestimated me .
there &apos;s a fourth way .
hold it right there !
f.b.i ! stop right there ! stop right there !
put your weapon on the ground !
now !
oh , look ...
somebody already beat me to it .
now you know why i didn &apos;t mention the fourth way .
rachel turner , you are under arrest for murder .
i gave you strict instructions not to bait her .
it worked , didn &apos;t it ?
how &apos;d you know she wasn &apos;t gonna shoot you ?
rachel turner has been officially charged
with the murder of agent david siegel .
i guess that &apos;s what they call closure .
look at it this way--
the next lucky woman who comes along
is gonna seem like a million bucks .
either that , or every relationship after this
is gonna seem really boring .
well , there &apos;s a lot of room between really boring
and someone taking a shot at you .
it takes a damn good agent to help solve his own murder .
something else i should tell you .
i &apos;m not sure i &apos;m up for another surprise right now .
i don &apos;t think this will come as a huge shock to you .
you &apos;re going to washington .
they want me as a section chief in d.c.
well , it &apos;s been a long time coming .
you deserve it .
uh , the job starts in two weeks .
two weeks ? wow .
yeah .
hard to imagine not working here anymore .
yeah . poor jones . what &apos;s he gonna do ?
well , i &apos;m hopeful that he will keep you out of trouble .
in light of recent events ,
i &apos;m not sure that &apos;s the best idea .
you helped bring in siegel &apos;s killer .
that &apos;s the only thing you should feel responsible for .
if anyone sees it differently , they should come talk to me .
she got what she deserved . you , my friend , did not .
not yet ...
but the game &apos;s not over .
you want to go after the diamond ?
well , look on the bright side .
now we don &apos;t have to split it three ways .
are you sure you &apos;re ready ?
there &apos;s no reason to wait .
peter &apos;s on his way to d.c. rebecca &apos;s behind bars .
wow . it took me longer
to get over my favorite barista moving to brooklyn .
i &apos;m guessing millions of dollars in treasure
would have helped speed up your recovery .
considerably .
so we have an equation to solve .
moz ?
i must summon the equation from the depths of my mind .
i require total silence and a sprig of rosemary .
rosemary ?
it stimulates the brain .
well , i don &apos;t have any rosemary .
then total silence will do .
i really appreciate the opportunity , bruce .
yeah , you bet . oh , i can &apos;t wait to get started .
bruce , i have to run . el just got home .
i appreciate you keeping an eye on her .
thanks , bye .
so good to be home .
good to have you home .
really good .
how &apos;s neal doing ?
pretty shook up .
did he learn something from it ?
well , i &apos;m afraid to say it , hon , but maybe .
well , for the better ?
we &apos;ll see .
are we celebrating ?
siegel &apos;s case is closed .
rebecca is behind bars ,
and the burkes are going to washington .
is it official ?
it is . i just spoke to bruce .
i &apos;m so proud of you .
well , this is actually perfect timing ,
&apos;cause , um , i have some news of my own .
when we first started talking about washington ,
i reached out to the national gallery .
they just called me and offered me a position .
what ? fantastic .
i can &apos;t believe you didn &apos;t tell me .
well , i didn &apos;t want to get my hopes up .
you know , i thought it was a long shot .
to us ...
and to our new life .
we &apos;re really doing this , aren &apos;t we ?
yeah , i think we are .
you okay ?
yeah , it &apos;s just , uh--
it &apos;s finally hitting me , you know .
we &apos;re gonna be packing up this whole house
and walking out that front door .
yeah .
it &apos;s gonna be tough to leave .
yeah .
but then again , there will be a new door we can go through ...
at the national gallery .
and the f.b.i headquarters .
to new doors .
hello ?
do you accept a collect call
from the metropolitan correctional facility ?
inmate ...
rachel turner .
do you accept a collect call
from the metropolitan correctional facility ?
