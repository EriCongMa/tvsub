No free refills. Got it?
Give me another breakfast special. Two eggs over easy.
Everything okay?
Oh, you haven't touched your bacon.
That's bacon?
Who knew?
Well, it's turkey bacon. It's got a lot less fat in it.
Try it. It's good.
You got any ketchup?
Hey! Do you see the sign? No outside drinks!
Easy, stanley.
Sorry.
He made me throw mine away, too.
Would you like a cappuccino on the house?
No, thanks. I had enough coffee.
Rizzoli!
Where's the big tub of cream cheese?
It had mold on it.
So scrape it off! You think I'm made of money?
Sir, are you all right?
Mr. Stanley, call for help!
All you had to do was open the cafe.
What did you do to him?
Nothing! Call 911!
Sergeant! Get in here and help!
What going on?
He just fell over. I don't know what to do.
Get the CPR mask.
We need an ambulance at 3 Schroeder Plaza.
Oh. So you come faster if it's a cop?
Keep people out of the cafe.
No, it's a fat guy.
Oh, god.
He is dead.
Drink.
Thank you.
Instant?
You served me instant?
I'm so tired, you're lucky I didn't serve you drano.
Ugh! God.
Where's the baby?
Tommy took the last shift.
Why would people have more than one of these?
How'd you get him to stop crying?
I did this for two hours. My arms are wrecked.
He'd be better if he was breast-fed.
Don't look at me.
Newborns need a lot of human contact to properly attach.
Take him out of the car seat.
No, he was almost falling asleep.
Okay.
Come here.
Hello. How good.
His name's Mario.
No, you can't name him Mario!
Why not? It's latin. It means "Manly."
Yeah. So there.
Hey, Maura, you ready to swab me?
What -- do you two want some privacy?
I'm gonna find out if he's my kid today.
Let's do this.
Wait -- is this gonna hurt?
Oh, my god. Tommy, it's a giant cotton swab.
Open.
Okay.
Okay, now it's Mario's turn.
You're not a mario.
He looks just like you, Tommy.
We should name him T.J., for "Tommy Jr."
It's weird that she's so good with babies.
Yeah. It is a little surprising.
Wasn't it wonderful
the way we tag-teamed the feedings all night?
You know, baby elephants are raised
by the female relatives in the herd --
The aunts, the sisters, grandmothers.
Don't repeat this 'cause I'll deny it,
but I wish we were elephants
so we could keep him.
Maybe me and Lydia could share him.
No, Lydia abandoned him.
Well, technically, she didn't abandon him.
She left him with family.
Which is why I can't arrest her.
Maybe she was just scared.
Wow! One hand! Can I try?
No!
That doesn't make any sense.
"Suspicious death at the Division 1 Cafe"?
I hope ma's all right.
It's going straight to voicemail.
Maura, come on. We've got to go.
But I'm in my robe, and you're in your mother's pajamas.
Yeah, so, we'll change in the car. Come on.
Wait -- w-what do I do with him?
Use two hands.
W-- I -- alone?
Jane.
Wait. I can't. Jane?
Two hands.
Jane!
You sure you're okay?
He was enjoying his breakfast special,
And, boom -- he just drops dead.
How's the baby?
He's fine.
You're sure you've never seen this person before?
No, never.
You don't think it's something he ate here
that got him sick, do you?
Botulinum causes death in 2 to 10 hours.
Hey, you heard her -- we never saw him before.
He brought whatever killed him with him.
How'd he die?
I'm not sure.
The hemoptysis suggests all kinds of causes.
We don't even serve hemoptysis.
Hemoptysis simply means he coughed up blood.
His credit cards, cash, photo of this boy.
Hey, Korsak, look at this.
What the hell?
Victim had my name and phone number in his wallet.
Do you recognize him?
No.
Phil Taylor, 45.
Worked at Jericho pharmaceutical supplies.
I'd like to test the food he was eating.
Okay. Hey, ma, where's his plate?
I, uh... I don't know.
Stanley, where's the dead guy's last meal?
Why are you asking me? Do I look like a busboy?
Jane, he ordered the breakfast special.
A-and he didn't eat the turkey bacon.
Oh, but wait.
He asked for ketchup.
Thank you, ma. That's very helpful.
Mr. Stanley? Are you okay?
Check on him. Make sure he isn't faking.
I'll call the paramedics back.
Are you feeling any discomfort or tightness in your chest?
Maybe some.
Okay, ma, this is serious.
It's a suspicious death.
The food that you gave the dead guy is evidence.
You think Stanley could have gotten rid of it?
Oh, he wouldn't do that, Jane.
I hope not, 'cause if he did, he's going to jail.
Oh. Oh, thank god, bro. Thanks for coming.
I got to get back to work. Is the baby okay?
Yeah. I-I think so.
Ythink so?
I fell asleep on the couch.
H-he was sleeping on my chest, and...
Frankie, he rolled off.
Oh, my god. Did he hit his head?
No, he landed on a pillow.
Oh, Tommy.
I know! What if he can never ride a bike now?
God, I can't be a dad!
What?
And now he hates me!
Oh, crap.
What if the neighbors called social services?
Calm down, would you?
Lydia?
Hey, Tommy.
Oh! I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Oh, Tommy Jr.
Oh, I love you so much.
"Tommy Jr."?
I wanted to call him Mario.
Can you forgive me? Can you forgive mommy?
Looks like he does.
You think?
Lydia, you abandoned that baby.
According to my probation officer,
all she did was leave him with his father.
You the father?
No.
How about you?
I might be.
Okay. Now we're getting somewhere.
Can't just leave a baby on a doorstep
and then waltz back in when you feel like it.
Did he get frostbite?
What?! No, but he --
Paperboy hit him with a paper?
Raccoons chew his little arms off?
No.
Okay, then. There you go. He wasn't abused.
Let's go, Lydia.
Wait -- wait a minute! Frankie, do something!
Will you arrest her?!
Not Lydia, though.
I can't. There's no legal grounds.
We can't prove abuse.
Technically, all she did is leave him with family.
So, move -- unless you're gonna shoot us.
I'm sorry.
I thought he might be better off with the Rizzolis.
But I...I can't.
I can't. He's my baby.
Well, he might be my baby, too.
You know, I-I was up all night with him, taking care of him.
Hey, leave her alone. She's been up bawling all night.
Now, come on, Lydia.
And don't think you're getting out of child support.
I'm sorry for all the trouble.
We're just gonna go.
Cuckoo birds are brood parasites.
You desperately need some sleep.
I'm thinking of creative child-rearing solutions.
Okay, what do cuckoo birds do?
They lay their eggs in a host bird's nest,
and then they let that bird raise the babies.
However, they first destroy the host bird's eggs.
So, all we'll need to do
is sneak into some nice family's home,
drop off T.J., and get rid of the other kids.
Maybe elephants are a better example.
Ooh. Very nice.
Barely digested stomach contents.
Mm-hmm. What is it -- eggs?
Good for you! Yes!
Can you tell what that is?
Only if there's a prize.
Pancake.
Excellent.
I wonder what this is.
Smell it.
I'm good.
It's a mint leaf.
And this is chocolate.
And this could be whipped cream.
Maybe from a milkshake?
No, it was a coffee drink -- likely frozen.
But ma doesn't serve frozen, chocolate, minty cappuccinos.
"Frappuccino"
is a portmanteau of "Frappe" And "Cappuccino."
Do you ever worry that you'll sound pretentious?
No.
What about "Tank"?
Oh, my god. It's gonna be a long day.
Another portmanteau.
"Tommy" plus "Frank" equals "Tank."
Hang on. We're being interrupted by something relevant.
Hello, Susie.
Uh, hello, detective.
The victim's tox screen.
This is strange.
Phil Taylor had extremely high levels of warfarin in his blood.
What's warfarin?
An anticoagulant.
Which Mr. Taylor's medical records
indicate that he wasn't taking.
Warfarin is also used in rat poison.
When's the last time
we had someone commit suicide by rat poison?
Never.
Well, I think we have ourselves a homicide.
Start in the kitchen first.
Okay.
Oh. Where do you think you're going?
So, you weren't actually having a heart attack, huh?
It was gas pains.
Sorry to disappoint you.
Okay, this is now a crime scene,
so I need the both of you out of the cafe
so we can collect evidence, please.
Was he murdered?
He was poisoned.
Ohh, how awful!
I found this on a food-prep counter.
So? Where there's food, there's rats!
It contains warfarin.
Okay, that's rat poison, Stanley,
and that's what killed your customer.
So if any of that ended up in his food,
you'll be charged with negligent homicide. Let's go.
No, I'm an innocent man, unjustly accused!
And I need a statement. One from you, too, ma.
You're not under arrest, so Sergeant Korsak will take yours.
Let's go.
I have the right to remain silent!
Anything I say can and will be used against me.
Yeah, keep talking, Stanley.
I love a reason to arrest you.
You'll be hearing from my lawyer!
Okay. Nice talking to you, too.
You think this is the end of this abusive use of power,
you got another think coming, Rizzoli!
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I thought he was gonna start shouting "Attica!"
Sure does a lot of protesting
for a guy who knows nothing about a missing breakfast.
Okay, so, what do we know about our victim?
He was single, he lived alone.
But he had a son?
No. According to his family, that's not his kid.
They don't know who it is
or why his photo was in Phil's wallet.
Well, that's weird.
Victim was a big pharmaceutical executive.
Lost his job five years ago.
Was doing temp work for a pharmaceutical distributor.
And you have no idea why he had your number, Korsak?
Nope.
Notepaper was from St. Avitus.
They have an A.A. meeting almost every day.
There was one at 6:00 A.M. this morning.
Well, that's right nearby.
Maybe he came in early
and had breakfast while he waited for you.
Jane, can I talk to you?
Yeah.
Hey, Frost, come on. Let's go check out St. Avitus.
What's the matter?
Lydia took the baby.
Hi. My name's Larry. I'm an alcoholic.
Hi, Larry.
I spent so many nights in the drunk tank,
I thought I'd save some money and get my law degree.
It turned my life around.
Now I'm "Larry the Cadillac lawyer."
Got my office in the trunk of my car.
So, if you slip and fall, you can come and find me --
and my caddie.
Thanks for letting me share.
Five-minute coffee break, okay?
Recognize anyone?
She looks familiar, but...I can't place her.
Vince!
Great seeing you, too.
Oh, come on, Vinnie.
You really don't recognize me?
I...know we know each other.
We did.
Oh, god.
Detective Frost, this is my first wife, Dana.
Oh, hi. Wow.
Uh, how do you forget your wife?
Oh, it's okay. It's been a while.
40 years.
And we were only married for three weeks.
Well, it was a year, actually,
but I spent most of it in Vietnam.
I still owe you an apology.
No need. It was so long ago.
Dana, we need your help.
Phil.
Is he in trouble?
He's dead.
How?
We don't know yet.
He was just here this morning.
He comes here almost every day.
My name and number were in his wallet.
Did you give them to him?
Yes.
I talk about you sometimes.
Let it go, Dana. I have.
Why did you give him my number?
He said he needed a cop he could trust.
But he didn't say why.
Do you know who this is?
I have no idea. No.
Was Phil close with anyone here?
No. Not really.
Oh, wait. Wait.
He had just started hanging out with a woman.
I don't know her name.
Can you give us a description?
Mm, 40s, blond...
tall, thin, unhappy.
That's really all I know.
Thanks.
Good to see you.
You too.
Oh, yeah, really good.
Hey, what was your name, again?
No, I understand.
Thanks for your help, Dan.
Okay. That was the A.D.A.
It's what I thought --
As his mother, Lydia has a legal claim.
She holds all the cards.
What about Tommy?
We didn't get the paternity test back yet.
A relative can file a motion for temporary guardianship.
Okay.
But it's a three-month wait for a hearing.
Which means T.J. goes into foster care.
We can't do that to him.
Lydia does seem a bit hapless, but she doesn't seem evil.
I mean, I don't like her,
but T.J.'s definitely better off with her
than being bounced around in the system.
Frankie, you don't think she'd hurt him, do you?
No way -- I wouldn't have let her take him
if I thought something was gonna happen to him.
Well, what about Lydia's mother?
Lydia said that she doesn't like babies.
Maybe we should try to get him.
What? You would like to raise T.J.?
Sort of, yeah.
I mean, not full time. Just...some of the time.
I don't know! We should tell ma.
Well, Tommy wants to tell her
once he gets the paternity-test results.
Stomach-contents results
came back positive for high levels of warfarin.
Which means that the portal of entry
is the food that he ate.
Okay, so we need to get that food.
Frankie, will you get the CSRU techs,
go through the garbage?
Ma said the victim had a breakfast special.
You want me to look for
his scrambled eggs and half-eaten pancakes?
Are you kidding me?
It doesn't look like she is.
Please?!
The culprit could also be the coffee,
although the cafe doesn't serve chocolate-mint coffee.
Okay, so put a disposable coffee cup
on your treasure-hunt list.
Thank you!
Okay, is that why you moved the bookshelf?
So you could see all the dead bodies come in?
Yes. Isn't it convenient?
Oh, yes. I'm forgetting all my troubles.
I'm sorry. I don't recall your name.
Alex. Alex Simmons.
I haven't been doing many shifts lately --
not since I started medical school.
Wonderful. Congratulations.
Thank you. It's a lot of work,
but it's what I always wanted to do.
Dr. Isles, is that
a Casandra Strickenberg?
Uh, why, yes, it is.
How did you know?
Her giveaway is the trapunto effect in the appliqus.
Love the hand-stitching. Such gorgeous fabric.
With an eye like that,
maybe you should've considered fashion design.
Actually, I love to sew.
I'm lucky -- great fine motor skills.
I also knit, crotchet, and bead.
Bead?
Yeah.
Cool.
So, Alex, why don't you tell us about the victim?
Lucy Cox, 32.
Found dead in her apartment in Dorchester.
No signs of visible trauma.
Bloody mucus.
I'll have to do a gram stain for the sputum.
The paramedics note how long she was ill?
A week?
Neighbor said she was at home from work with a bad cough.
Significant pleural effusion.
Splinter hemorrhages.
Oh, no.
I'm gonna tell you both something very frightening,
but I don't want either of you to panic, all right?
Maura, what is it?
Hold your breath and move as fast as you can to the crime lab.
We have a code red.
Go now!
Come on. I'm asking you to list the possibilities.
All right? That's not guessing.
Jane, try to stay calm.
I'm calm.
It's my imagination that's hysterical.
Is it ebola or leprosy or die-before-lunch syndrome?
Ebola is a possibility.
So is sars, anthrax, dengue fever,
west nile virus, drug-resistant tuberculosis...
I'm Captain Green, incident commander.
I need to know your level of exposure.
Limited physical contact, possible aspiration.
Remove your clothing. Place it in these bags.
Shower with the decontamination soap.
Change into the tyvek suit.
Ohh. I've only worn this Casandra Strickenberg once.
Oh, how awful.
Yeah, it's a real tragedy.
You need to take a decontamination shower.
Wh--
Where's the stall?
Well, now is no time to be modest, Jane.
The longer you delay,
the more chance you have of becoming infected.
Well, this is awkward.
Sorry. Medical school.
I'm exhausted. It's killing me.
But --
What?!
You want your tyvek now?
Yeah. I can't wait to wear it.
I would also like about a hundred more of these tiny towels.
Okay.
I am officially offended.
This is interesting.
Wha--
What? That Alex fell asleep while I was naked?
He's obviously not into women.
No, I'm talking to an official from the CDC.
No reports of any hemorrhagic viruses
anywhere in Massachusetts.
That's great news.
But there's an outbreak of bacterial meningitis in Boston.
Is that treatable?
Yes.
There's a gram stain test coming back soon.
Alex! Are you okay?
I'm fine, babe.
Oh. So he's not into women?
Hello? I'm the one that has to supervise him.
I did a striptease in front of my morgue tech.
Oh, no worries. He wasn't watching.
I didn't know you two were together.
We've been keeping it a secret.
I hope that's okay.
There's no policy in place about dating coworkers.
oh, yeah, no. You can shower in front of them.
You guys okay?
We're fine. Thank you.
Yes, we're fine. Just peachy.
I love being Jane the bubble girl.
Frankie, you didn't tell ma about me or the baby, right?
You kidding me?
Did you find the food?
No. I'm sorry.
Bring me up to speed on the case.
Jane, it can wait.
Susie, is that the gram stain test?
It's bacterial meningitis, Dr. Isles.
Oh, that's wonderful.
Yay?
You are free to go.
Yes! Whoo!
Thank you. That's...far enough.
Thank you.
Captain Green, you didn't by any chance happen to keep
the Casandra Strickenberg, did you?
My skirt.
Ah. It was just about to be autoclaved.
I stopped them.
Oh, thank you.
Good job.
Yes. What a relief.
Welcome back.
You think it's weird for a guy not to recognize his ex-wife?
Not if he's had a head injury.
That explains so many things.
Stop, would you? It's almost 40 years ago.
She looked different.
Oh! Okay. I get it now.
She doubled in size.
Where's Detective Cooper?
The drug unit borrowed her back.
For how long?
Mm. A while.
Riley must be bummed.
Jane!
I found it.
You found what?
Okay, you know how Mr. Stanley
has a "No outside drinks" policy?
I have not memorized the caffe's penal code, no.
Well, I remembered the dead man told me
Mr. Stanley made him throw out his coffee.
And I found his
mint-chocolate fro-cap in the lobby garbage.
Ma, this -- this is great.
Okay, Maura's got something.
What the heck?
It's Dana. She wants to talk about Phil's murder.
I've really been wrestling with myself.
A.A. works because
everything you say is safe.
It can't be repeated.
Dana, Phil Taylor was murdered.
It's possible the killer
was someone he met at one of those meetings.
Phil said he ruined a life.
Whose life? Did he say?
A little boy's.
When he shared last night,
he said he was finally ready for justice to take its course.
Do you think maybe he was coming here to turn himself in to me?
I don't know.
He was scared.
Dana, exactly what did he say?
He said he had blood on his hands,
that he made another terrible mistake --
worse than the boy.
He said he couldn't live with himself
until he made it right.
That's all he said.
Any idea how long he'd been coming to meetings?
We just gave him his five-year chip.
Thanks. That helps a lot.
Vince.
I'm really sorry I didn't wait for you.
It's my biggest regret.
A lot of guys got "Dear John" letters.
It's okay, Dana.
I'm glad you got help, straightened your life out.
It's safe.
It is so clean in here,
you can eat off the tables.
Let's not, Maura.
Bacterial meningitis doesn't survive its host's death.
Results on the contents of the coffee cup.
It tested positive for high levels of warfarin.
Thank you.
Alex is very nice.
Yeah, he said the same about you.
He couldn't believe how
comfortable you were being naked around him.
Really? He noticed?
This might be a little too much information for my boss,
but we met at a nudist retreat.
If you want to join us sometime, that would be...
Well, many illnesses can be improved with nudity
and some vitamin D.
Psoriasis, for instance.
Is there hiking?
Hiking?
Well, less likely to contract Lyme disease if you're not wearing any clothing.
Thank you. That sounds heavenly, Susie.
We'll let you know.
Really?
Aren't you the one that was worried
about stripping in front of your morgue tech?
Well, now that I know he's a nudist...
Results, please.
The cup tested positive for warfarin.
That is how our victim was poisoned.
Too bad. I was really hoping to arrest Stanley.
Not today.
Okay, so, Phil guzzles rat poison in his fro-cap.
I'm guessing he didn't taste it
because of all the chocolate and the mint?
1,500 calories in a mint fro-cap?
No wonder he has so much adipose tissue.
50 Boston Joe's in the city.
Which one sold him his fro-cap?
Phil must have been talking about this boy.
Why else would he have this photo in his wallet?
Well, he started going to A.A. five years ago.
Right about the time he lost that big pharmaceutical gig.
Maybe his company knew something.
Frost, did you check Phil's driving record?
Yeah. It was clean.
Looks about 8 years old.
Maybe we try running hit-and-runs over the last five years.
Look for one that involves a young boy.
Okay.
So, Vince, how'd it go with Dana?
What's that supposed to mean?
It means, did you remember her?
Oh. Yeah.
We made love on the interview-room table.
Why would you put that image inside my head?
Okay, here we go --
Hit-and-run five years ago on Phil's block.
The victim was an 8-year-old boy --
Jimmy Flores.
Look at the newspaper photo.
What happened to Jimmy?
He was paralyzed.
Was Phil ever a person of interest in the hit-and-run?
Pulling up the police report.
Police interviewed Phil once.
Says his lawyer was with him.
Lawyer told police Phil's car was stolen.
Jane, uh --
Tommy wants us to meet at your apartment after work.
Frankie, we're in the middle of a homicide.
Fine.
Then don't blame me
when you're investigating Tommy homicide tomorrow.
You probably should go.
Okay. I will be there.
Thank you.
So, Phil confesses to having blood on his hands
and needing to make something right.
And the next day, he's dead. So, what did he mean?
Let's start with his fro-cap.
There's a Boston Joe's right next to St. Avitus.
Go. I'll keep digging.
Take Korsak.
He needs a minty fro-cap after working up a sweat
with that wife he couldn't remember.
Dana dumped you when you were in Vietnam?
She met somebody.
Okay, that's terrible.
And I'm glad she doubled in size.
Hi. Can I help you?
Hi. Boston homicide. Do you recognize this man?
Oh, sure. That's "Five-pump minty extra."
Five pumps with extra chocolate.
Was he in here early this morning?
He's here early every day.
Did you see "Five-pump" with anyone?
Yeah -- "Double-tall, nonfat, no-foam latte."
And what does "Double-tall, nonfat" look like?
Tall, skinny blonde. Sourpuss.
Dana mentioned a woman
that Phil hung out with at A.A. meetings --
Blond, tall, thin, unhappy.
Yeah, she's always complaining.
Says she can taste caramel in her latte,
so she has me make it again 'cause she doesn't do sugar.
So explain to me why she was pouring all that sugar in today.
Did she take "Five-pump minty's" drink, too?
I think so.
Excuse me.
I have a triple-tall, no-foam, extra-whip,
half-chocolate, half-caramel fro-cap at the bar.
I'm guessing that wasn't sugar that "Double-tall" was pouring into
"Five-pump minty's" fro-cap.
Ma, I'm so sorry.
I just don't understand.
We just can't walk away from that baby.
I talked to Lydia.
Is she gonna share custody?
No, she says she can't forgive herself for abandoning Mario.
"Mario"? You named him Mario?
Ma!
Lydia named him Thomas Sparks Jr.
"T.J."
The paternity test came back.
And?
He's mine.
Tommy's a baby daddy.
I-I told you what I did.
I mean, I can't be a father to him.
He almost got killed.
Oh, Tommy.
He rolled off your chest.
I dropped you once.
Oh, my god!
Is that what happened to him?
What's that supposed to mean?
I was rocking him, and I fell asleep.
You were fine.
You, uh... bumped your lip.
I cried. You cried.
And look -- it's all okay.
Tommy, it's all right, okay?
We'll all help you.
Yeah. Come on, Tommy. Man up.
Lydia's mom says they're coming after you
for child support, anyway.
Well, I'm gonna pay child support.
I'm no dead beat dad.
Okay, good.
But I don't have a steady job,
and Lydia and I aren't a couple.
Tommy, we want T.J. In our lives.
So do I.
All right.
So you fight for joint custody.
Tommy...
There's another way to do this.
Well, if she says she has a plan, she has a plan.
Yeah, but I think we all know about my mother's planning.
That's where Tommy got his "Planning" Abilities.
Oh, if it doesn't work out,
you can always use defense condition one.
Um, I-it's much cooler if you say "Defcon one."
Def...Con...One.
Much cooler.
Morning, sweetheart.
Morning, Ma.
Morning, Stanley.
Arrest me.
What's the charge --
Felony or misdemeanor asshole-ish-ness?
Jane!
Stay out of this, Rizzoli.
Felony.
I need to confess,
and I'd prefer to do it in the proper surroundings.
Oh, I can't wait to hear what you have to say.
Yeah, let's go -- upstairs.
That camera better be on,
because I don't want you twisting my words.
I'm old enough to remember the Watergate tapes.
Talk. We're in the middle of a murder investigation.
I did it!
You killed Phil Taylor?
I hid key evidence in a homicide investigation.
I should be punished to the full extent of the law.
You took the food?
Where is it?
Why did you take it?
I panicked!
I didn't want the cafe to be blamed,
so I grabbed it.
And then, when it became a murder --
No, this is very serious, Stanley.
I hope you have a very, very good legal team.
Division 1 cafe was my life's work.
You people are...
You're family.
No kidding? Family?
Just like in a real family,
you don't always like all your relatives.
Yeah, I know exactly what you mean.
God, I wish there was something we could charge him with.
What?
You're free to go.
I am?
Yeah.
Yeah, on one condition.
Two conditions.
You give Mrs. Rizzoli a raise.
And you stop calling her "Rizzoli!"
This is from the doorway into the Boston Joe's.
Okay, that's Phil.
Yeah, and see the woman?
Yeah. Who's she?
I'll see what I can do with facial recognition.
Okay, I'd like to know what they're arguing about, too.
No help there. No audio.
Hey, Frankie?
Yeah?
Come in here.
Frankie can read lips.
Really?
Yeah, he spent a lot of time on the bench
when he started little league -- reading coaches' lips.
I got really good at it.
Got good at benchwarming, too, huh?
Tell him.
Tell me what?
Aw, doesn't matter.
Yes, it does!
He was an amazing ballplayer,
and he was on his way to the professionals.
Wow. I'm sorry.
Blew out my arm. Thrower's elbow.
So, what do you need?
Tell us what he's saying.
Uh, okay.
He's saying... "I didn't sign up for this."
Didn't sign up for what?
Looks like he's saying,
"I didn't know men in tights would kill people."
A-mazing.
How does he do it?
Wait. No.
"I didn't know mennonites would kill people."
Well, there's a mennonite killer out there.
Not helping, Frost.
Whoa. This is.
Got a hit on facial recognition.
Alice Vanderbilt.
Let's go pick her up.
Alice has a nice house.
It's in foreclosure.
Hey, guys.
That's car exhaust.
Engine's running.
I need an ambulance at 1429 pinecrest drive.
She's dead.
She's dead.
Cause of death is carbon monoxide poisoning.
Okay, Alice's fingerprints were on
the car keys, the hose, the doors.
It's a suicide, isn't it?
Yes.
All right, so maybe we're looking at a murder-suicide.
Phil and Alice, they hook up at A.A.
Phil dumps her. She kills him.
Hello, Alex.
Dr. Isles.
Hey, Susie said you might be joining us camping.
Huh? No. I can't.
My skin burns so easily.
It does not.
So, Alex, what do we have here?
Victim -- Brian Radcliff, 31.
I think it might be another case of bacterial meningitis.
I think you might be right.
The cdc is reporting more cases of meningitis in Boston.
Meningitis. Oh, my god.
Frankie wasn't saying "Men in tights"or "Mennonites."
Jane?
Jane?
Right there.
He's saying, "I didn't know meningitis would kill people."
That's why he wanted to talk to me.
I'm still not getting how the mennonites in tights
killed the people with meningitis --
or what that has to do with you, Korsak.
Yeah, me either.
You got me. Let's go through it again.
Phil Taylor was a big pharmaceutical executive,
gets fired, takes a crap job distributing pharmaceuticals.
Alice Vanderbilt was a quality-control lab tech
at Rampvex pharmaceutical industries.
Alice had an M.D.?
Maybe that's how she was able to afford that nice house.
That's in foreclosure.
Her bio says she was a successful anesthesiologist
before she closed her practice.
To become a lab tech?
What did Alice do?
Is her medical license still current?
No. She hasn't renewed it since 2009.
But she keeps an open application on file.
Okay.
Did our two victims with meningitis
have any connection to each other?
Both were young professionals
who worked in the financial district.
I found a needle-puncture wound with a contusion
on the right bicep of the man who died of meningitis.
So you're saying he was injected? With what?
A flu vaccine.
Okay, wait a minute. This is starting to make sense.
Does Rampvex manufacture flu vaccines?
Yeah.
So, maybe Alice contaminated the flu vaccines.
And Phil distributed them.
But why would you infect people with bacterial meningitis?
It's treatable.
Same reason somebody tainted tylenol -- create fear?
No, I don't think so.
Maura, why would two healthy,
young professionals die if it's a treatable illness?
Well, they only died because they had underlying problems --
compromised immune systems.
Otherwise, it would've just made them very ill.
Pain and suffering -- plus, they can't work,
all because of a bad flu vaccine?
And Rampvex, the manufacturer, has deep pockets?
But who's gonna sue?
Neither of our two dead victims were married.
Oh, you're worth a lot more ill or gravely injured than dead
when you're single.
So, Phil and Alice created their own class-action lawsuit.
But they were the bad guys. They couldn't file the lawsuit.
They could if they had one more partner --
a lawyer.
Hey, Frost, is Phil's lawyer's name
in the hit-and-run report?
No.
But Alice's medical-license application lists her lawyer.
What do you know?
It's a lawyer we've met, Frost.
Hi. My name's Larry.
Hi, Larry.
And I'm an alcoholic.
Why don't you tell them the truth, Larry?
You came here to troll for clients.
Hey, I'm in the middle of my share.
What is going on?
Larry here isn't actually an alcoholic.
He just likes taking advantage of people
who are trying to make their lives better.
What the hell?
You met Phil and Alice here
and came up with a great scheme.
Hand over the keys to that big Cadillac outside.
We need to have a look at your "office."
Let me see a warrant.
Let me see the keys.
It's like Christmas.
Hey, those are private mementos.
"Did a bad flu vaccine give you meningitis?
Larry the lawyer can help."
Yeah.
Helped two young, innocent people into an early grave.
Let's see what's in Phil's file.
You think that's from the night he ran over Jimmy Flores?
Oh, you are sentimental.
You kept the license plate from Phil's "stolen" Car.
What mementos did you save from Alice?
No, he handled Alice's malpractice suit
after her drinking killed a few of her patients.
Hey, I was trying to help my clients. They were desperate.
Yeah, desperate to get their livelihoods back.
Too bad your scheme went a little haywire
when you and Alice realized Phil had a conscience.
Yeah, Alice had one, too -- she killed herself
when people started dying from your tainted vaccine.
This looks like a lot number for the bad vaccine.
It's such a good thing
that you lawyers keep such tidy records.
I'll call Public Health, make sure they seize them.
You're under arrest for murder
and conspiracy to commit murder, Mr. Bukowski.
Hello.
Hi.
Nice to finally meet you in person.
I don't know how to apologize enough
for all that I've put you through.
What about me?
You too.
Okay. Let's start fresh.
We are so glad that you could join us for dinner.
Yeah, what are we having? I don't like spicy.
Think you're gonna like being called "grandma"?
By Tommy Jr.?
Yeah. I think I'm gonna like it.
I like getting another shot at this.
Yeah, I didn't do so bad with Lydia, did I?
This baby provides us an opportunity
to, uh...start new.
Yeah.
Can we get you something to drink?
Water for me.
Which one of you is the doctor?
I am.
I need that stuff -- uh, makes you sick if you drink.
Antabuse. I can write you a prescription.
Can you believe it?
All because of this little guy.
If you get tired or you need to go to the bathroom or anything,
I'd be happy to hold Tommy Jr.
Oh -- "T.J."
Here.
He likes it when you mush him against your breasts.
I bet he does. I still like that.
Tommy.
What?
What do you do for a living?
Lots of things.
Yeah. That means you don't do nothing.
Oh, well. Least your ma's nice.
Tommy's a good guy.
Yeah. He is.
And I just want to say... I'm here for T.J.
We all are.
Oh, my gosh.
You said you wanted the baby to be around family.
For better or for worse, we're family.
You're not getting out of child support.
Mom.
Shall we sit down and eat?
I never turn down a free meal.
So, you ever been to opening day at Fenway?
Every year.
Yeah?
Think how much fun we're gonna have
at Thanksgiving and Christmas and New Year's.
T.J.'s gonna be a Red Sox fan.
Oh, I'd like to teach him how to fence.
If you do, I will teach him how to sew and knit and bead.
Really? I want to take classes with you.
Stop.
What? It'd be so fun.
Can we please just get through this meal?
Who's hungry?
I don't like spicy.
