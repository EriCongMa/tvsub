goodbye , derek .
right , meredith .
what do we got ?
katie bryce , 15 @-@ year @-@ old female ,
new onset seizures ,
katie belongs to the new attending now , dr. shepherd .
it &apos;s a subarachnoid hemorrhage .
she &apos;s bleeding into her brain .
you earned the right
to follow her case through to the finish .
i will discover that i am not just the other dr. shepherd .
i &apos;m the wrong dr. shepherd .
i &apos;m just not ready to forgive you yet .
looking sharp . got a hot date ?
yeah , something like that .
when we &apos;re alone ,
she &apos;s so -- - she &apos;s a wildcat , huh ?
richard .
pierce .
do you really want this ?
this is one of the simpler divorces i &apos;ve seen .
you just signed divorce papers ,
and you don &apos;t want a drink ?
what are you -- what are you , pregnant ?
i think i am .
&quot; any day where no one died is a good day . &quot;
someone said that once .
wait . it was me . i said it .
any day you wake up ...
... and your body &apos;s still moving ...
is a good day .
keys . where are my keys ?
did you check in your jacket pockets ?
you can start over .
found them !
you can forget your past mistakes .
you can make a new start ...
live every day like it &apos;s your last .
all that crap they put on pillows and car bumpers ...
sorry .
... it &apos;s all true .
guys !
you &apos;re alive .
respect that .
not everybody is .
this room is full of dead people .
i know it &apos;s easy to forget , but come on .
something happened to them --
a mistake , a disease , a stupid twist of fate .
they left their bodies here
for us to learn from , to become better .
let &apos;s have a little respect .
time of death -- 8 : 12 .
keps , call the plumber , would you ?
sure .
did he really just call the morgue &quot; the plumber &quot; ?
oh , yeah .
that &apos;s something we say over there .
they circle the drain , then they clog it .
&quot; call the plumber . &quot;
hunt &apos;s right . we hate that guy .
hey , you got a minute ?
hi , yeah . what &apos;s up ?
listen , i just got our last joint cellphone bill ,
and i &apos;m pretty sure they still charged your card ,
so i just want to write you a check .
it &apos;s fine .
no , no , no . you shouldn &apos;t have to --
no , seriously , jackson . it &apos;s fine .
if you &apos;re sure ...
this one &apos;s on me .
okay .
you have to tell him .
why ?
&quot; why &quot; ?
so he &apos;ll come back to me ?
he doesn &apos;t want to be married .
a baby wasn &apos;t gonna change that . it shouldn &apos;t change that .
because it &apos;s his baby . because he --
i know . i know .
but i am happy for the first time in a year .
and as soon as i tell him ,
everything &apos;s gonna get all complicated .
and for right now
obviously , obviously i &apos;m going to tell him ...
when i &apos;m ready .
you &apos;re only wearing one boot .
i know . i was late .
and i couldn &apos;t find the other one .
amelia .
you think i &apos;m bootless &apos; cause i &apos;m drunk .
it &apos;s fine . i &apos;m not drunk .
i just got my 60 @-@ day chip .
i am bootless because i had sex with owen ,
and his stupid trailer is very dark .
and i was very late because of the sex ,
which was so great .
so i just thought , &quot; screw it . &quot;
i may not know where my boot is , but it &apos;s gonna be a great day .
i hate you .
don &apos;t hate .
i haven &apos;t had sex in days .
deluca and i almost got caught by webber .
by webber ?
so we had to cool it in the hospital .
and he &apos;s never got time .
interns never have any freaking time .
so i never have sex .
i know where all my boots are .
why me ?
i don &apos;t know .
webber just said he wanted you today .
every year , webber singles out one intern to be his guy .
my first year here , it was me .
he called us the big dogs .
okay , well , why me , though ?
are you complaining right now ? because this is an honor .
you have been anointed .
webber is on top of his own service .
you just listen and learn from a master .
you have got the golden ticket , my friend .
dr. webber . here &apos;s your guy .
good morning , sir .
i &apos;m , uh -- i &apos;m really excited to --
you look tired .
a late night ?
no , sir , i --
i have a consult with robbins .
great . let &apos;s get started .
okay . you can do rounds on my post @-@ ops .
i &apos;ve got a stack of intern applications on my desk
that need filing .
3316 needs her drain checked ,
and 1242 could use a rectal exam .
okay .
you know , actually deluca .
yes , sir .
what &apos;s this ?
dry cleaning . address is on the card .
edwards !
morning .
uh , pit &apos;s called for a consult .
i rounded on all of your post @-@ ops .
four aneurysm repairs , all doing fine .
mr. klein is awake and responsive .
what &apos;s the matter with you ?
nothing .
edwards .
it &apos;s all good .
it is a great day ,
and you are bringing me down , edwards .
spill it .
it &apos;s like we &apos;re in a rut of clipping aneurysms
&apos;cause that is all we do .
it would be nice to throw a glioma in there
once in a while .
you &apos;re hoping for someone to have a brain tumor ?
just to mix it up a little .
because you &apos;re bored of aneurysms .
i &apos;m not complaining . i &apos;m just --
you are .
but i &apos;ll tell you what , if you are so bored ,
the next aneurysm that walks through that door ,
you will clip it yourself .
wh-- are you serious ?
are you serious ? !
okay , we &apos;ll take you up for a scan ,
and then we &apos;ll figure out what &apos;s going on .
yeah , sit tight . don &apos;t worry .
her baby &apos;s fine .
yeah , i &apos;m betting it &apos;s an appendicitis .
yeah .
so , how &apos;d it go ?
uh , you left the bar with the girl in the jean jacket .
i would have put you with crop @-@ top .
she looked smart .
i mean , so how was it ? uh , did you hit it off ?
oh , um , it was fine .
fine ?
yeah .
fine .
fine ?
patient &apos;s 25,
complaining of new @-@ onset headache ,
transient numbness on the left side .
she passed out in gymnastics practice .
do you know what i &apos;m thinking ?
you &apos;re thinking it &apos;s an aneurysm .
i &apos;m thinking it &apos;s my aneurysm .
it could be a tumor .
don &apos;t say that .
this morning , you were praying for a tumor .
katie .
who are you ? i asked for dr. shepherd .
and here i am .
no , you &apos;re not . dr. shepherd is a guy .
look , i was here before years ago .
my first year . my first day .
subarachnoid hemorrhage . you &apos;re katie bryce .
i.v. lost en route ,
started grand mal seizing as we descended .
all right , get her on her side .
and i didn &apos;t get stuck with someone this clueless ,
and that was , like , a nurse .
oh , my god .
they still let you be a doctor here ?
so , let me get this straight .
i had a thing . you guys fixed it .
now the symptoms are back and worse .
i mean , i &apos;m not having seizures yet ,
but i keep going numb , and my head --
well ...
we &apos;re not exactly sure what we &apos;re dealing with , katie .
i was going to say your prelim neuro looks good .
the symptoms are different from last time .
for the record ,
i don &apos;t want to go through that again .
you shaved my head .
i was , like , an ug @-@ mo troll for weeks
until i could get extensions going .
did you guys screw this up last time ?
found it .
it &apos;s so old it &apos;s not even in the computer .
webber had to s @-@ show me the archive room .
you still doing pageants , katie ?
what was it , rhythmic gymnastics ?
nope . stopped those .
pageants got me a full ride
to u.w. , though .
and now i coach gymnastics .
two of my girls are olympic qualifiers .
impressive .
no offense , but are you gonna be operating on me ?
dr. grey is not a neurosurgeon .
good . i mean , she was kind of a train wreck .
she kept getting me lost .
it was my first day .
hey , katie bryce is back .
katie who ?
katie bryce .
day one of my internship -- mystery seizures ,
cristina and i solved it ,
derek operated .
it was my first surgery , bailey .
how do you not remember this ?
you were an intern , grey .
you weren &apos;t even a person to me yet .
okay . so , what do you think it is ?
a re @-@ bleed or -- - i don &apos;t know yet .
it feels like a tumor .
could be a re @-@ bleed or the clip slipped .
well , i watched derek place the clip .
the clip didn &apos;t slip .
meredith , clips slip .
yeah , i &apos;ll get her to c.t.
order an angio , too , based on her history .
meredith .
what ?
she &apos;s my patient . she came back .
she was derek &apos;s patient . now she &apos;s mine .
oh , katie bryce !
uh , when derek had all of the interns
chasing their tail for the answer ...
yes !
... and he was chasing your tail ?
yes .
i &apos;m gonna stay with you on this .
mer , i have it .
my name is on the chart . i need to make sure that we --
i will update you .
i &apos;m gonna go discharge a cancer patient .
i will be back .
counting the minutes .
daphne .
you hitting the books ?
yeah , i have to . i have finals on monday .
physics . i loved physics .
yeah . it would have been easier when i was 20 .
well , but you &apos;re starting over .
it &apos;s impressive . starting over is hard .
string theory is harder .
but i pass this ,
i graduate in june ... with honors .
okay . you want to tell her how she did here ?
flying colors .
all your follow @-@ up labs came back clear .
dr. grey got all the mets off your liver .
no recurrence . so ...
so , after 10 months ...
say it .
you &apos;re cancer @-@ free .
yes !
thank you ! thank you so much !
of course .
oh , man .
okay , so , now are you going to call david ?
you &apos;re a nag .
i kicked your cancer . we had a deal .
i need another month .
one more month , and i get my diploma .
also , one more round of chemo ,
and then they take my headphone jack out .
and then i will .
how long &apos;s the redness been there ?
i don &apos;t know . a week .
all right , put the books down .
i need to take a look at that .
damn it ! i was almost out of here .
so ... the ring ... is in your drawer .
yeah .
what are you gonna do with it ?
well , what do you mean ? it &apos;s in my drawer .
are you gonna take it back ?
do you want me to take it back ?
well , it was -- it was probably expensive . - it was .
and , uh , it &apos;s not doing anyone any good in your drawer .
yeah , well , i didn &apos;t buy it for the drawer .
look , you didn &apos;t say yes or no .
is this no ?
is that what you &apos;re saying ?
no .
&quot; no , &quot; like , &quot; no &quot; ?
or , &quot; no , &quot; like , &quot; not no &quot; ?
i @-@ i ...
i don &apos;t know .
this was great !
the scans back on our appendix yet ?
robbins , we &apos;ve been at this for a while .
what ?
i have facilitated in the introduction
of over a dozen women for you .
i mean , i &apos;m invested in this project .
so when the results we &apos;re getting are &quot; fine , &quot;
we can do better than that .
um , it was -- it was better than fine .
it was , uh
you don &apos;t want to hear about this .
no , no , no , i think feedback is crucial to our success .
that way we can course @-@ correct if need be .
it was way better than fine .
uh , it turns out that she &apos;s in real estate
and an insanely good kisser .
and she , uh --
i mean , she knows her way around the neighborhood .
oh , oh , where &apos;d you go ?
everywhere .
if you know what i &apos;m saying .
from the hills to the low country
and all around downtown .
i get -- yeah , yeah .
oh , my go-- i &apos;m sorry .
i got carried away .
no , no , i @-@ i asked .
thought that you wanted to know .
i asked .
scans are ready .
i rounded on your post @-@ ops , got your labs back ,
filed the intern applications , and picked up your dry cleaning .
they got the stain out of your purple sweater .
excellent .
yeah , so , you were right about the appendicitis .
all right , deluca ,
you can go get my surgery transcriptions .
yes , sir .
hey , what &apos;s wrong with you ?
me ? oh , i &apos;m fine .
i just ... never got time to eat today .
richard .
don &apos;t kill the interns .
deluca , go eat .
quickly .
thank you .
did you know 8 % of all repaired aneurysm patients
had a recurrence ?
it &apos;s gonna be a tumor .
statistics say aneurysm .
her symptoms say tumor .
and if it is an aneurysm , you said i could clip it .
you said it &apos;s a great day .
and i agree with you . it is a great day . i feel great .
uh , so i will clip it , right ?
hush .
crap . it &apos;s a tumor .
no . it &apos;s an aneurysm .
that &apos;s -- that &apos;s an aneurysm ? i &apos;ve never seen one that big .
yeah , i don &apos;t want to clip that .
neither do i.
it does look infected .
it might be superficial , but it needs to come out .
lidocaine .
you should have come in sooner .
i have a history paper due on wednesday .
i &apos;m supposed to blow that off ?
plus two jobs .
i only fight cancer on the weekends .
so , there might be some blood , but you can look away .
oh , please , you guys have poked and prodded me forever now .
oh , my god , that &apos;s a lot of blood .
let &apos;s page cardio .
it &apos;s okay .
that doesn &apos;t look okay .
i know . i know . it &apos;s scary .
daphne , look at me .
you &apos;re okay .
that &apos;s normal ? all that blood ?
let &apos;s hang ffp , platelets ,
one gram of txa , and cross @-@ match her .
where is cardio ?
riggs is coming .
ugh . riggs .
yes . &quot; ugh . riggs &quot; is here .
daphne , right ? what do we got ?
daphne &apos;s portacath got infected , and when i removed it --
it was a gusher , it looks like .
all right , i &apos;ll book an o.r.
no .
daphne , i &apos;ve given you
some medicine to help your blood clot ,
so i &apos;m just going to apply pressure
and wait for it to work .
well , i think we should move her ,
get a good look at the vessels .
well , i &apos;m hoping it just resolves itself here
so we don &apos;t have to open her up and make it worse .
so you &apos;re just gonna keep holding pressure ?
that &apos;s the plan . katie bryce .
oh , you need to be somewhere ? i can do it .
are you leaving ?
no , no , i &apos;m here .
it &apos;s just holding pressure .
she &apos;s my patient .
she &apos;s sort of my patient now .
it &apos;s a cardiac case .
you can wait if you like .
all right . we &apos;ll wait a little while , and we &apos;ll see .
blake , you need repeat coags every 30 minutes .
and push my chole and cover my post @-@ ops .
and get an update on shepherd &apos;s patient katie bryce .
dr. shepherd . absolutely .
speak .
dr. grey was wondering if --
yeah , tell her she &apos;s off the hook .
it had nothing to do with the old case .
your original repair is fine .
okay , great .
this is new .
it was a frontal lobe aneurysm --
the biggest one i have ever seen .
how big ?
like ...
this isn &apos;t charades , blake . i need to see it .
she just wants to look at the scans .
then why doesn &apos;t she come here and look at the --
she &apos;s busy with a patient .
you know what ? so am i.
tell her i don &apos;t have time to give her computer access .
tell her she doesn &apos;t need to see the scan .
absolutely .
that &apos;s a monster .
what &apos;s her approach ?
is she going to clip it or do a primary repair ?
i don &apos;t think she &apos;s gone that far yet .
well , find out !
tell her if she wants to talk to me ,
she can come down here and talk to me
and not keep sending her mole .
tell her , &quot; thank you , meredith ,
for the overwhelming vote of confidence ,
but i will use the approach i deem necessary , &quot;
and if she doesn &apos;t trust me ,
she can come down here and clip this thing herself .
and also , you can tell her to ...
yeah , i don &apos;t want to do this anymore .
what is your problem with shepherd ?
mind your business .
i don &apos;t think she likes you very much .
oh , you picked up on that , huh ?
all right . all right .
go tell shepherd ...
tell her to not screw it up .
i think she gets that .
all right , a little more lidocaine .
ooh , maybe sailing .
maybe i should get a boat .
ah , that &apos;s too much upkeep .
well , i need something , all right ?
i feel like , you know , it &apos;s a new chapter .
start something new .
i need something that i can --
what about golf ?
nah , i think it &apos;s too cliche , though --
golfing doctors .
what did you do with your ring ?
a little lighter . a little lighter .
um , i didn &apos;t know what to do with it ,
so it &apos;s just in a drawer .
right . it goes in a drawer .
and if she didn &apos;t say yes or no --
i mean , april -- i mean , she &apos;s , like , fine .
it &apos;s like she &apos;s better than fine .
you &apos;d think that she was the one
that was pushing for the damn divorce .
sloan always wanted me to try golf .
i never liked golf .
love golf .
just don &apos;t try hockey .
jo doesn &apos;t know what she wants .
neither does amelia .
one day , she wants to stop things cold ,
the next , she never wants it to stop .
if it keeps going like this -- - it &apos;s all a lot of upkeep .
if she didn &apos;t want a ring on her finger ,
why does she care what i do with it ?
because it &apos;s just sitting in that drawer
like a loaded gun .
and every time we have sex or a fight ,
he could just pull it out and point it at me .
do you even want the ring ?
i don &apos;t want it ... right now .
grey and shepherd are gonna kill each other ,
and i &apos;m going to die in the crossfire .
grey needs to chill &apos; cause it &apos;s not even her case .
shepherd could cut her some slack .
it was her case .
it was supposed to be my case .
do you think i should tell him to take it back ?
jo , you already did .
if you wanted it , you &apos;d be wearing it .
i mean , are you doing all right ?
&apos;cause after arizona and i got divorced ,
it felt like my insides were ripped out of me .
no . i @-@ i @-@ i mean -- uh , yeah , it was awful .
it was amicable , i guess is the word .
civil and polite and awful .
but , um , no .
i , uh -- i feel good .
i feel really good .
you got divorced really different from how i did .
hey , man , you got to take this , okay ?
no , no , just take it . just -- here .
you &apos;re exhausted . you &apos;re not too exhausted , right ?
no . no . no .
okay .
no ! no !
ohh , it &apos;s webber .
it &apos;s webber ?
yeah , he &apos;s made me his guy now ,
which apparently means
relentless pages and endless scut .
webber has singled you out ?
yeah , anointed me , apparently .
oh , okay . he knows about us .
no .
why would he make me his guy , though ?
i don &apos;t know . um , he &apos;s my father .
he &apos;s your what ?
yeah , maybe he doesn &apos;t know .
you said your folks are from boston .
yeah , yeah , he &apos;s my biological father .
maggie , he &apos;s your father ? !
uh , maybe it &apos;s just a coincidence .
oh , i &apos;m so screwed !
no , no , um , i &apos;ll ask him . i &apos;ll find out .
no , maggie . i told him you were a wildcat .
what ? ! why ? ! why would you do that ? !
webber &apos;s your father ? !
ah , what do you have ?
mitral valve .
i got cross .
what about ?
no , i mean my -- my intern .
i got cross today .
he &apos;s pretty good .
a little green .
who have you got ?
uh , deluca .
oh , you like him ?
i &apos;ve only worked with him a couple times .
yeah , he &apos;s an intern .
you know , he shows potential .
he &apos;s calm in surgery . steady .
yeah , he &apos;s got great hands .
i beg your pardon ?
in the o.r. &apos; cause he was an e.m.t.
i @-@ i heard ...
i think . i guess .
um , yeah , i think i heard that , too .
yeah . yeah .
he &apos;s a great roommate . dependable . quiet .
what ?
deluca .
right .
so , um , yeah , have fun with him today .
or , uh ... have a good ...
yeah .
bye .
yeah . bye .
yeah .
and these are the consent forms . there you go .
and this is a new one ?
yes .
and this one &apos;s bigger .
it &apos;s a very thin , fragile balloon .
even the tiniest disturbance
- walking around -- could pop it .
and if it pops , i die ?
why does this keep happening ?
you &apos;re predisposed to aneurysms .
it &apos;s just something that --
dr. shepherd fixed the last one .
i know .
the other dr. shepherd .
he knew how to fix it .
your first aneurysm was very difficult to diagnose ,
but it was easy to solve .
this one ...
it &apos;s very risky .
are you saying you can &apos;t do it ?
i &apos;m saying that i will do my very best .
katie .
we have to try .
otherwise ...
i know . i just ...
are you as good as your brother ?
are you better than him ?
camera scope seems jittery .
hold the damn thing still , deluca .
sorry , sir . i &apos;m trying .
&quot; great hands . &quot;
so , are you gonna be seeing &quot; jean jacket &quot; again ?
mm , no . not her again .
she was fun , but a little crazy .
&quot; hoop earrings , &quot; maybe . she was funny .
tonight is , um , oh , &quot; artisanal soap . &quot;
remember her ?
you said she was ditzy .
yeah , she was .
but she smelled like lilacs everywhere .
robbins , how many women are you seeing ?
mm , not that many . right , deluca ?
hmm ? oh , i don &apos;t know .
i mean , who &apos;s counting ?
how would you know ? you &apos;re never there .
mr. secret lover spends every night
at his girlfriend &apos;s place .
that &apos;s -- that &apos;s not true .
i told you . he &apos;s the best roommate .
he has a girlfriend with her own place
and clearly a crazy sex drive .
is that the ileum just above the --
that &apos;s what that is .
oh , yeah .
he brought her to our place once .
oh , my goodness .
i thought he was killing her in there .
she &apos;s a screamer .
all right , that &apos;s enough !
can we focus on the base of the appendix , please ?
here &apos;s her latest lab results .
do you want me to book an o.r. now ?
septicemia .
pseudomonas . pcr positive times two .
i can go in , try to get local control ,
maybe subclavian repair .
yeah , but she &apos;s got a possible d @-@ dimer
with s.i.r.s. brewing .
we may have to .
i &apos;m worried she may not withstand g.a. , though .
do you want to dumb it down a little ?
okay , daphne , your portacath got infected ,
and it &apos;s caused sepsis .
a big infection all over ,
which can cause your organs to fail .
if i take my hands off and you &apos;re not bleeding , we &apos;re good .
and if i do bleed ?
then i have to take you into the o.r.
and try to stop the bleeding .
but if dr. grey &apos;s right ,
the surgery could make you worse .
i should have come in sooner .
do you want to call david now ?
no . i screwed up again .
who &apos;s david ? your husband ?
david is my son .
he was my son .
i made a bad choice .
i made lots of bad choices .
i chose ... all sorts of things over him .
i left him .
that was a long time ago .
six years .
he &apos;s 20 now . he &apos;s in college .
he has another mother now .
and i &apos;m just a mess .
you &apos;re not . not anymore .
call him .
yeah .
when i &apos;ve cleaned up my act , you know ?
i want to have my diploma .
i want to show him that i can be someone he can be proud of .
seems to me that you already are .
yeah , and then i got cancer .
and that is not your fault .
daphne , you have earned this .
i have watched you become a completely different person .
and he deserves to know you .
please call him .
no .
i &apos;m not going back to him with more problems .
okay . are you ready to take a look now ?
let &apos;s just wait a little while longer just to be sure .
hey , you paged ? what &apos;s that ?
this was derek &apos;s ?
yeah .
but that &apos;s not why i paged .
i , uh , left a boot at your place this morning .
yeah , yeah , i brought it in .
it was wrong of me to come over last night .
i should not be starting anything new .
not now .
okay , here we go .
no , i screw everything up .
i don &apos;t want you to be one of those things . i ...
listen , what else have you screwed up ?
are you kidding me ?
i nuked my relationship with meredith .
i got kicked out of my place .
i drank .
60 days ago . and you &apos;re doing great .
yeah .
i hit 60 days for the fourth time in my life .
ever since , i have been avoiding big cases like the plague .
i have just been doing aneurysm repairs
until i know i &apos;m ready .
and then today ,
i get this woman with a live grenade in her head
who happens to be derek and meredith &apos;s surgical love @-@ child ,
and i get to screw this up now , too .
i ...
i think i &apos;m gonna kill this girl .
okay , you want to know what i think ?
i think if there were
any other surgeons &apos; name on this old chart ,
you wouldn &apos;t be thinking twice about this .
meredith doesn &apos;t think i can do it .
who cares what she thinks ?
meredith is not a neurosurgeon .
and she certainly isn &apos;t you .
why are you giving a second to what she thinks ?
you &apos;re the one who has to do it , amelia .

it &apos;s a beautiful night to save lives .
let &apos;s have some fun .
i told the morgue she &apos;s coming .
nurse &apos;s station .
you called the morgue &quot; the plumber . &quot;
it &apos;s habit .
it &apos;s different over there .
you work on people who ...
it &apos;s part of their job to get hurt and die .
you never have to call the families .
someone else does that .
it makes you ...
yeah , i &apos;m trying to break that habit .
why did you come here ?
what happened with owen &apos;s sister ?
you &apos;re a friend of owen hunt &apos;s .
i figured he would have told you .
he said you put her in a helicopter ,
and it crashed .
all right , meg and i were working in a field unit .
we needed to transport a patient .
there was only room on the chopper for one of us .
it was gonna be an ugly ride ,
unprotected airspace .
so i said i was gonna go .
meg said it was her patient .
i told her no .
and we fought , and finally ...
i mean , it was her patient .
i would have done the same thing if it was mine .
so i couldn &apos;t tell her no .
and the helicopter ...
never got there .
no one knows what happened .
just ... disappeared .
no trace .
so he thinks you should have been on that helicopter .
i don &apos;t go asking about your dead husband , do i ?
oh . well ...

someone like you deserves someone very special --
a quality person .
and i worry that if you
squander your heart
with all of these many , many more frivolous --
the thing about being my wingman is you can &apos;t also be my dad .
richard , i owe you .
i &apos;m too young and too fun
to spend the rest of my life alone .
and i was -- i was too scared to try ,
but you helped me remember what it was like
when i was open and confident and fun and a little ... slutty .
you helped me be slutty again .
well , i &apos;m not sure i &apos;d phrase it like that .
you helped me fly .
so ... good job .
thank you .
i got to fly now .

congratulations .
we &apos;re not starting something new .
i don &apos;t accept that .
if it were new , i wouldn &apos;t have your boot .
now , if you want to start over ,
forget all that , start fresh ,
if that &apos;s easier for you , then we can do that , too .
however you want to do it . but let &apos;s -- let &apos;s do it .
just like new ?
yep . square one .
what are you doing ?
i barely know you .
at least ask me out on a date first .
we can start over . every day .
we get second chances ...
just be prepared . she may look a little --
i know .
i mean , i haven &apos;t seen her in six years .
... to become who we always wanted to be .
we can leave our past behind .
you sure you &apos;re ready for this ?
or we can learn from it .
and honor it .
hi , david .
we can decide it &apos;s never too late to change .
these people don &apos;t have that chance .
they left it to you .
they let you learn from them .
so let &apos;s say thank you .
and not screw it up .
