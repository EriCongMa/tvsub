there is a town in maine ...
i &apos;d like a room .
welcome to storybrooke .
where every storybook character you &apos;ve ever known ...
is trapped between two worlds ...
an evil queen sent a bunch of fairy tale characters here .
and now they don &apos;t remember who they are .
victims of a powerful curse ...
everything you love , everything all of you love ,
will be taken from you .
only one knows the truth ,
and only one can break her spell .
it &apos;s your destiny .
you &apos;re gonna bring back the happy endings .
you enjoy your stay .
do not despair , my dear . you will attend that ball .
who are you ?
i &apos;m your fairy godmother ,
and i &apos;m here to change your life , cinderella .
but ... my stepmother told me that i couldn &apos;t go .
she forbade me to leave .
your stepmother doesn &apos;t have this .
this wand has the power to take you to your ball ,
to your prince , and to ...
what ?
what did you do ?
now , now .
i got what i wanted .
there &apos;s no need to be frightened .
no need ? you just killed my fairy godmother .
she was trying to help me .
was she ?
do you know what this is ?
pure magic .
pure evil .
trust me . i &apos;ve done you a favor .
all magic comes with a price .
go on back to your life and thank your lucky stars
you &apos;ve still got something to go back to .
my life ...
it &apos;s wretched .
then change it .
you can &apos;t handle this .
wait . please wait .
i can handle it .
please . i will do anything
to get out of here . anything .
anything ?
do you know how to use that wand , mr ...
rumplestiltskin .
and , yes , of course i do .
then help me .
well , if i do ,
and you can indeed shoulder the , uh ...
consequences ,
then you &apos;ll owe me a favor .
name it . what do you want ?
something precious .
but i have nothing .
oh , but you will .
with this wish
will come riches more than you know .
i care nothing for riches . i &apos;ll give you anything you want .
just get me out of here .
now we &apos;re talking .
well , how does it work ?
fear not .
my needs are small ,
and all you have to do is sign on the dotted line .
do we have a deal ?
yes . yes . thank you .
there .
glass ?
every story needs a memorable detail .
let &apos;s see how they fit , shall we ?
now have a good time , but be sure to watch the clock .
are you sure we can be out in the open ?
enough sneaking around .
if your mom has a problem with me
walking you to a school bus ,
i am more than happy to have that chat .
you &apos;re brave .
you &apos;ll need that for operation cobra .
speaking of , do you think we need code names ?
isn &apos;t &quot; cobra &quot; our code name ?
that &apos;s the mission . i mean us .
i need something to call you .
well , you can just call me &quot; emma &quot; for now .
okay , well , then i &apos;ll see you later , emma .
what &apos;s with the siren ?
it &apos;s so hard to get your attention .
all right , well , you got it . are you arresting me again ?
i &apos;m thanking you ...
for your help finding that coma patient .
we all owe you a debt of gratitude .
well , what do i get--
a commendation ? key to the city ?
how about a job ? i could use a deputy .
thank you , but i have a job .
as a bail bonds person ,
there &apos;s not much of that going on here .
i don &apos;t see a lot of sheriffing going on around here , either .
well , here &apos;s your chance to see it up close .
there &apos;s dental .
why don &apos;t you think about it and stay a while ?
thank you .
how was your walk with henry ?
that &apos;s right . i know everything ...
but relax . i don &apos;t mind .
you don &apos;t ?
no ,
because you no longer worry me , ms. swan .
you see , i did a little digging into who you are ,
and what i found out was quite soothing .
it all comes down to the number seven .
seven ?
it &apos;s the number of addresses you &apos;ve had in the last decade .
your longest stint anywhere was two years .
really , what did you enjoy
so much about tallahassee ?
if you were wonding , i did find a place here in town .
i know , with ms. blanchard .
how long is your lease ?
oh , wait . you don &apos;t have one .
you see my point ?
in order for something to grow , ms. swan , it needs roots ,
and you don &apos;t have any .
people don &apos;t change .
they only fool themselve into believing they can .
you don &apos;t know me .
no , i think i do .
all i ask is ,
as you carry on your transient life ,
you think of henry and what &apos;s best for him ,
perhaps consider a clean break ,
it &apos;s gonna happen anyway .
enjoy your cocoa .
ohh . really ?
do you have a laundry i can use ?
oh , no , no , no , no , no ...
you okay ?
the sheets , they &apos;re ... uh ... they &apos;re pink .
you tried bleach ?
last night i felt contractions ,
the doctor said that the baby can come any day now .
so ... that &apos;s great .
it &apos;s just that , um ,
when the--when the baby comes ...
no one thinks that i can do this .
no one thinks i can do anything .
maybe they &apos;re right .
screw them .
what ?
screw them . how old are you ?
19 .
i was 18 .
when you-- when you had a kid ?
yeah . i know what it &apos;s like .
everyone loves to tell you
what you can and can &apos;t do ,
especially with a kid , but ultimately ,
whatever you &apos;re considering doing ... or giving up ...
the choice is yours .
it &apos;s not exactly what you might think it is .
it never is .
people are gonna tell you who you are your whole life .
you just gotta punch back and say ,
&quot; no , this is who i am . &quot;
you want people to look at you differently ? make them .
you want to change things ,
you &apos;re gonna have to go out there and change them yourself ,
because there are no fairy godmothers in this world .
ashley .
what are you doing ?
changing my life .
i know you think otherwise ,
but i don &apos;t enjoy these saturday city council meetings .
sometimes they &apos;re just unavoidable .
now ... you know the rules ?
yes on homework , no on tv , and stay inside .
good boy .
under no circumstance do you leave this house .
you mean don &apos;t see my mom .
she &apos;s not your mother .
she &apos;s just a woman passing through .
now do as i say , or there will be consequences .
i &apos;ll be back at 5 : 00 sharp .
i &apos;m so glad my stuff is here .
oh , thanks .
so that &apos;s all your stuff ?
what do you mean ?
is the rest in storage ?
no , this is all of it .
i &apos;m ... not sentimental .
well , it must make things easier when you have to move .
ms. blanchard , is ms. swan here ?
hi . my name is mr. gold .
we met briefly on your arrival .
i remember .
good . i have a proposition for you , ms. swan .
i , uh , i need your help . i &apos;m looking for someone .
really ? um ...
you know what ? i &apos;m gonna go jump i @-@ in the bath .
i have a photo .
her name is , uh , ashley boyd ,
and she &apos;s taken something quite valuable of mine .
so why don &apos;t you just call the police ?
because , uh ...
she &apos;s a confused young woman .
she &apos;s pregnant , alone , and scared .
i don &apos;t want to ruin this young girl &apos;s life ,
but i just want my property returned .
and what is it ?
well , one of the advantages of you not being the police
is discretion .
let &apos;s just say it &apos;s a precious object and leave it at that .
when did you see her last ?
last night . that &apos;s-- that &apos;s how i got this .
it &apos;s so unlike her .
she was quite wound up ,
rambling on and on about changing her life .
i have no idea what got into her .
ms. swan , please just help me find her .
my only other choice is the police ,
and i don &apos;t think anyone wants to see
that baby born in jail , now do they ?
no , of course not .
so you &apos;ll help me then ?
i will help her .
grand .
hey , emma , i was thinking we--
hey , henry . how are you ?
okay .
good .
give my regards to your mother ,
and , um , good luck , ms. swan .
do you know who that is ?
yeah , of course i do .
who ? &apos; cause i &apos;m still trying to figure it out .
oh , i meant in reality .
is that ... all you brought ?
henry , what are you doing here ?
my mom &apos;s gone till 5 : 00 . i thought we could hang out .
aw , kid , i wish i could , but there &apos;s something i gotta do .
please let me help .
no , no . it could be dangerous .
the pregnant maid is dangerous ?
she assaulted mr. gold .
cool .
this isn &apos;t a game . she &apos;s desperate .
how do you know ?
because i know .
well , then let &apos;s find her .
oh , no , no , no . there is no &quot; let &apos;s . &quot;
you cannot come with me .
then i &apos;ll look for her myself .
then i &apos;ll find you , and i &apos;ll bring you back .
then you wouldn &apos;t be helping the maid .
i am just trying to be responsible here .
and i &apos;m just trying to spend time with you .
oh , that is really not fair .
so the maid-- what &apos;s her story ?
what &apos;s wrong ?
nothing .
every year when i was growing up ,
i used to watch these fireworks from afar .
and i knew what they meant .
something special was happening at the palace ...
now they &apos;re for me ,
for our wedding .
i &apos;m so happy you could come .
son .
thank you , father .
my dear ella ,
we are thrilled to have you join our family ,
and i hope our family will soon be growing .
my darling .
congratulations , ella . you two are gonna be very happy .
why , thank you , james .
ella , dear .
oh ! sorry .
this is truly a night for celebration .
do you realize what an inspiration you are to everyone ?
all i did was get married .
all you did was show that anyone can change her life .
i &apos;m proud of you .
i &apos;m proud of you , too .
you . what are you doing here ?
i just wanted to make sure you were happy
with your end of the bargain--
you know ,
true love , riches , happy endings .
did you get everything you desired ?
yes . yes , i did . now what do you want ?
what &apos;s your price ? my jewels ? the ring ?
no , no , dear . keep your baubles .
what i want is something you don &apos;t yet possess ,
but something i know is ... coming ...
your firstborn .
what are you doing ?
i thought you were hunting .
i was , but the weather wasn &apos;t agreeing ,
so we came back early .
are we going somewhere ?
you &apos;re going somewhere .
something &apos;s happened .
what ?
i &apos;m pregnant .
ella , that &apos;s wonderful .
why are you upset ? this is what we wanted .
there &apos;s something else .
when we met that night at the ball ...
it wasn &apos;t my fairy godmother who sent me .
it was rumplestiltskin .
i made a deal with him for this life .
i was stupid .
i didn &apos;t understand the price of magic ,
so i promised him something .
what did you promise him ?
he tricked me .
i thought that he &apos;d want our gold or jewels .
what was it ?
our baby ?
i &apos;m so sorry ,
and now i &apos;m gonna lose it all--
my life and ... you .
no .
i don &apos;t care what that imp said .
magic may have brought us together ,
but it didn &apos;t create this love .
but i made a deal .
i can &apos;t break that . he &apos;s too powerful .
then the answer is simple .
we make another deal .
so this boyfriend of hers--
you don &apos;t think he was involved in her disappearance ?
uh , that would mean he was involved with her at all ,
which he isn &apos;t .
he left her in the lurch right after they found out
they were expecting .
hasn &apos;t spoken to her since . like i said , he &apos;s a--
hey , hey , hey ! billy , be careful .
you almost shattered my wolf thing , billy .
it &apos;s good luck .
i &apos;m sorry , ruby , but , look , it &apos;s fine .
um , ruby , what about her family ?
oh , um , she &apos;s got a stepmom and two stepsisters
that she doesn &apos;t talk to .
wait . a stepmom , stepsisters , and she &apos;s a maid ?
henry , not now .
look , i don &apos;t know what you &apos;ve heard , but it &apos;s wrong .
everyone thinks she &apos;s not ready to have this kid ,
but she &apos;s trying-- taking night classes ,
trying to better herself ,
trying to get her life together .
can you understand that ?
i think so .
then maybe you should just stay out of it .
she &apos;s been through enough already .
i &apos;ve been through it , too , ruby , and i can help her .
then try her ex .
where can i find him ?
he lives with his dad .
can i help you ?
sean herman ?
yeah . who are you ?
i &apos;m emma swan . i &apos;m ...
i &apos;m looking for ashley boyd .
she &apos;s in trouble .
i just thought maybe she came to see you .
my son doesn &apos;t have anything to do with that girl anymore ,
so whatever trouble she &apos;s in , i am sorry for ,
but there &apos;s nothing we can do to help you .
you &apos;re the reason he broke up with her .
absolutely . i &apos;m not gonna let my son
throw away his entire life over a mistake .
so you just told him to leave her ?
well , what are they going to do , raise the child
in the backseat of a car ?
some people only have the backseat of a car .
well , they &apos;re to be pitied .
i &apos;m not letting that happen to my son .
dad , maybe we should help her look .
it &apos;s a waste , sean .
sean , if you want to come , come .
stop letting other people make decisions for you .
if ashley runs away with this baby ,
she &apos;s gonna be in some serious trouble .
she &apos;s running away with the baby ?
yes .
sean , inside .
now .
look , believe me ...
if i knew where she was , i would tell you .
i went to a lot of trouble to get her that deal .
deal ? what are you talking about ?
you don &apos;t know ? ashley agreed to give up the child ,
and she &apos;s being paid very well to do so .
she sold the baby ?
oh , you make it sound so crass .
i found someone who &apos;s going to find that child
a good and proper home .
and who are you to judge
whether ashley is capable of providing that ?
look at her . she &apos;s a teenager ,
and she &apos;s never shown any evidence of being responsible .
how could she possibly know how to be a mother ?
maybe she &apos;s changing her life .
everybody says that . now , look , i found someone
who &apos;s going to pay ashley extremely well ,
someone who &apos;s going to see to it that everybody &apos;s happy .
mr. gold .
well , isn &apos;t that why you were hired ,
to bring him the baby ?
you can &apos;t make her double @-@ cross gold .
no one &apos;s ever broken a deal with him .
happy to be the first .
if ashley wants to have this baby , she should have it .
anyone who wants to be a mother should damn well
be allowed to be one .
why didn &apos;t you tell me she sold the baby ?
because i didn &apos;t think it was important .
really , considering that &apos;s why she &apos;s running away ?
look , ashley &apos;s my friend .
i don &apos;t like the idea of people judging her .
ruby , where &apos;s your car ?
you didn &apos;t send me to sean to find her .
you sent me there to give her a head start .
look , i &apos;m only trying to help her .
yeah , so am i.
ashley &apos;s in more trouble than you know , ruby .
where is she ? don &apos;t make her deal with gold without me .
i can &apos;t talk in front of him . he &apos;s the mayor &apos;s kid .
hey , i &apos;m on your side .
henry ... i need to find this woman ,
and in order to do that , i need you to go home , okay ?
so please listen to me , seriously .
she &apos;s not gonna tell me anything if you &apos;re around .
okay .
thank you .
she left town . said she was gonna try boston .
thought she could disappear there .
how long ago did she leave ?
about a half an hour .
what &apos;d she tell you ?
henry , what the hell ?
i am going to boston . you can &apos;t come with me .
you can &apos;t go to boston .
she can &apos;t leave .
bad things happen to anyone that does .
i don &apos;t have time to argue with you over the curse .
i &apos;ve got to get you home .
we have to stop her before she gets hurt .
we &apos;re wasting time .
if you drop me off , you &apos;ll never catch up to her .
henry ...
then mr. gold will call the police ,
and he &apos;ll have her sent to jail .
buckle up .
ashley , what did you get yourself into ?
why are we down here ?
we need a place to keep him .
rumplestiltskin is the most dangerous man
in all the realms .
he needs his own special prison ,
so we converted the mines to hold him .
but how will we get him here ?
he &apos;s eluded all forever .
his strength is also his weakness--his deals .
he can &apos;t resist making them , and we already know
who he wants to deal with next--you .
we &apos;ve sent word with one of snow &apos;s bluebirds .
he &apos;s accepted a meeting with you .
you &apos;re going to tell him that doc heard something
with his stethoscope-- two heartbeats .
you &apos;re going to tell him it &apos;s twins .
and if he wants both , which he will ,
you propose a new deal .
grumpy .
a quill ? i @-@ i don &apos;t understand .
the blue fairy casts a spell on it .
whoever signs with this will be frozen ,
their magic made impotent .
all you must do is to get him to sign the contract .
ella , this man is a scourge .
you are doing the entire land a service .
should we even use magic ?
isn &apos;t that what &apos;s causing these problems to begin with ?
what if this magic also has a price ?
then i will pay it .
i will do whatever is needed
to save you and our child .
let &apos;s go .
i hope you like it .
a lot of dwarf blood went into it .
you sure this will work ?
once he &apos;s in there , he &apos;ll never get out .
you &apos;ll be safe .
we can do this , ella .
okay .
let &apos;s get him .
i told you .
it &apos;s her car .
ashley ?
my baby .
it &apos;s coming .
is the baby really coming ?
oh , yeah . don &apos;t worry . the hospital isn &apos;t that far .
no . no , no , no . take me to boston .
i can &apos;t go back there . oh , no .
we don &apos;t have four hours . trust me . i know .
no , i can &apos;t go back there . please .
he &apos;s gonna take my baby .
i won &apos;t let that happen .
but do you know what you &apos;re asking for if you keep this child ?
are you really ready ?
yeah .
are you sure ? because i wasn &apos;t .
you weren &apos;t ?
nope . if you want to give this kid its best chance ,
it &apos;s gonna be with someone who &apos;s ready .
so know what that means .
your whole life is gonna change , and once you decide
that it &apos;s yours , this running away can &apos;t happen .
you have to grow up , and you can &apos;t ever leave .
understand ?
yes .
i want my baby .
well , well , well .
you &apos;re starting to show .
a little bird told me you wanted to speak .
yes .
i &apos;d like to alter the bargain .
that &apos;s not what i do .
but i think you &apos;ll want to .
i &apos;m having twins .
is that so ?
let &apos;s have a look .
and you would , what , give up both ?
why is that ? i wonder .
my husband--he &apos;s ...
he &apos;s having a hard time . our kingdom is poor .
we &apos;re losing money . our crops are dying .
we can &apos;t support ourselves or our people .
and you would trade your other child for ...
comfort ?
i can always have more children ,
but i can &apos;t make crops grow where the soil is dead .
in exchange for our other child ,
you will see to it that our land is once again fertile .
i think it &apos;s more than fair .
yes !
yes , yes .
it is , if what you &apos;re saying is true .
it is , and all you have to do
is sign on the dotted line .
what a lovely quill !
wherever did you get it ?
it &apos;s from our castle .
you know , the only way to stop me is through magic .
i &apos;m not trying to stop you .
of course you &apos;re not , because as we all know ,
all magic comes with a price ,
and if you were to use it to , say ... imprison me ,
then your debt to me would only grow ,
and we wouldn &apos;t want that now , would we ?
just sign the contract , please .
are you sure you &apos;re happy with this new arrangement ?
then so it shall be .
thomas !
no one breaks deals with me , deary .
no one .
no matter where you are , no matter what land you find yourself in ...
i assure you , i will have your baby .
you know , emma , you &apos;re different .
what &apos;s that ?
you &apos;re the only one who can do it .
break the curse ?
yes , i know . you keep telling me that .
no . leave .
you &apos;re the only one who can leave storybrooke .
you left and came and found me in boston .
but i came back . i &apos;m 10 .
i had no choice , but if anyone else tried to go ,
bad things would happen .
anyone except ... me ?
you &apos;re the savior . you can do whatever you want .
you can go .
ms. swan , the baby is a healthy 6 @-@ pound girl ,
and the mother is doing fine .
what lovely news . excellent work , ms. swan .
thank you for bringing me my merchandise .
did we really win ?
yes . i told you we would .
i was so afraid .
i was so afraid that we &apos;d fail , that ...
i &apos;d have to go back to that life , that ...
that terrible life . i was ...
i was afraid that i would lose you
and that nothing would have changed .
as long as i &apos;m alive , you will never go back to that life .
now ... how is our little alexandra ?
alexandra ?
did i not mention that i picked out a name ?
a name ? that &apos;s more like a prison sentence .
well , i like it .
men . you really know nothing of ch--
ella , what is it ?
oh , it &apos;s--it &apos;s the baby .
something &apos;s wrong .
no , no . it can &apos;t be . it &apos;s too soon .
it must be the stress , the excitement .
oh , i &apos;m dizzy .
sit . sit .
i &apos;ll go get you water .
okay .
thomas , it &apos;s okay !
it &apos;s passed .
thomas ?
thomas ?
thomas ? !
what did you do ?
ella , what &apos;s wrong ?
your highness , what happened ?
what did you do to my thomas ?
i haven &apos;t done anything .
in case you haven &apos;t noticed , i &apos;ve been otherwise engaged .
something &apos;s happened to him . you know ! tell me !
i have no idea , deary ,
but i did warn you .
all magic comes at a price .
it looks like someone has just paid .
don &apos;t listen to him . we &apos;ll find thomas .
no , you won &apos;t .
until that debt is paid , until that baby is mine ,
you &apos;re never gonna see him again ,
in this world or the next , cinderella .
i will have that baby !
well , well .
must be my lucky day .
care for a cup , ms. swan ?
a baby ? that &apos;s your merchandise ?
why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
well , because at the time , you didn &apos;t need to know .
really ? or you thought i wouldn &apos;t take the job ?
on the contrary ,
i thought it would be more effective if you found out yourself .
after seeing ashley &apos;s hard life ,
i thought it would make sense ... to you .
i mean , if anyone could understand the reasons
behind giving up a baby , i assumed it would be you .
you &apos;re not getting that kid .
actually , we have an agreement ,
and my agreements are always honored .
if not , i &apos;m going to have to involve the police ,
and that baby is going to end up in the system ,
and that would be a pity .
you didn &apos;t enjoy your time in the system , did you , emma ?
that &apos;s not gonna happen .
i like your confidence .
charming , but all i have to do is press charges .
she did , after all , break into my shop .
let me guess . to steal a contract .
who knows what she was after ?
you know , no jury in the world will put a woman in jail
whose only reason for breaking and entering was to keep her child .
i &apos;m willing to roll the dice that contract doesn &apos;t stand up .
are you ?
not to mention what might come out about you in the process .
somehow i suspect there is more to you than a simple pawnbroker .
you really want to start that fight ?
i like you , ms. swan . you &apos;re not afraid of me ,
and that &apos;s either cocky or presumptuous .
either way , i &apos;d rather have you on my side .
so she can keep the baby ?
not just yet .
there &apos;s still the matter of my agreement with ms. boyd .
tear it up .
that &apos;s not what i do .
you see , contracts , deals--
well , they &apos;re the very foundation of all civilized existence ,
so i put it to you now .
if you want ashley to have that baby ,
are you willing to make a deal with me ?
what do you want ?
oh , i don &apos;t know just yet .
you &apos;ll owe me a favor .
deal .
what &apos;s her name ?
alexandra .
that &apos;s pretty .
thank you for getting me here .
mr. gold was outside .
i took care of it . she &apos;s yours .
she is ?
but what did you do ?
made a deal with him .
thank you .
thank you .
kid , it &apos;s almost 5 : 00 .
we gotta get you home .
i have to go .
henry &apos;s expecting me home at 5 : 00 ...
but i &apos;ll see you again ...
at the next council meeting .
oh , and don &apos;t forget ,
you left your socks under the bed .
&quot; pumpkin . &quot; my code name .
i was thinking , in honor of cinderella--
pumpkin .
you got a better one in mind ?
yep .
well ?
i &apos;m not sure you &apos;re ready yet .
henry !
about what you said at the hospital
about me being able to leave ...
yeah ?
see you tomorrow .
henry ?
henry ?
what did i tell you ?
do not ...
leave your shoes lying around on the stairs .
someone could get hurt .
is that her ?
sean .
i am so sorry . i never should have left you .
you &apos;re back ?
yeah , i &apos;m back .
here . i got her a present .
i don &apos;t know if they &apos;re gonna fit .
they &apos;re perfect .
hello ?
graham , it &apos;s emma .
i was thinking ...
maybe some roots wouldn &apos;t be so bad .
that deputy job still open ?
absolutely .
