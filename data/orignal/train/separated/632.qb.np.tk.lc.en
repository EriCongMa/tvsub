i &apos;m taking the shot .
no , no !
we don &apos;t know if padma &apos;s still alive .
we were hoping to involve you
with the campaign in a more official capacity .
they tape their meetings .
been holding on to it in case grayson came after me .
i &apos;ve given some thought to your offer . i accept .
this just came for you . it &apos;s marked &quot; urgent . &quot;
you &apos;ve been keeping something from me , mason .
a very lonely 16 @-@ year @-@ old girl
surrendered her firstborn son .
victoria .
she has another son .
all too often , we mask truth in artifice ...
concealing ourselves for fear of losing the ones we love ...
康拉德 · 格雷森
or prolonging a deception for those we wish to expose .
描述一个影响了你的人 以及他是如何做到的
we hide behind that which brings us comfort
from pain and sadness ...
or use it to repel a truth too devastating to accept .
durand .
well , you &apos;ll notice i left &quot; detective &quot; off there
since you haven &apos;t found padma yet .
you &apos;re lucky i even call you back , ross .
why ?
&apos;cause i really thought that we mended fences
after you misguidedly
questioned me in her disappearance .
i don &apos;t know . what was it , six weeks ago ?
that was routine . telling you every day
we have no new leads isn &apos;t .
so unless you have something new , i got a job to do .
i wish i did .
like i told you ,
it &apos;s the first 48 hours that matter the most ,
and we &apos;re--
968 hours past that .
right . got it .
how long have you been here ?
i &apos;m worried about you .
after i lost padma ,
i found this .
she says that she &apos;s lucky that i didn &apos;t abandon her
after everything that happened .
she said she &apos;d wait for me forever .
she &apos;s somewhere ...
out there , ems , waiting for me .
nolan--
look , i have to believe it .
you know , even if every alley
that i run down is a dead end .
and every time i try to help with padma ,
amanda , or ...
even the white @-@ haired man last year , i ... fail .
don &apos;t forget that you saved jack &apos;s life .
已回城 需要见一面
wow . start your reveng @-@ ines .
that &apos;s him , right on cue .
look , i know he &apos;s getting in deep with the graysons .
so ... what do you two have brewing ?
i had nothing to do with that .
jack still won &apos;t let me in .
nolan , your friends need you .
you can &apos;t keep hiding away in this cave .
and if we &apos;re gonna find padma ,
i think i have a good idea . you just need to trust me .
ah , the r.s.v.p.s to the grayson masquerade ...
each one a person
who &apos;ll pretend to be your friend for the night .
you know , try as you might ,
you are not gonna ruin my good mood for the day ,
or my ball , which , if memory serves ,
we had to cancel last year due to your murder charge .
yeah , don &apos;t remind me .
lisi miller can &apos;t make it .
it appears she &apos;s headed
for a friend &apos;s &quot; destination divorce , &quot;
whatever that is .
but sloane hanover &apos;s going to be there .
she &apos;s dying to see you .
you &apos;re dying to set me up .
well , it has been over six weeks since
your failed reconciliation attempt with emily .
yes , based on a threat from the initiative .
the picture and the bullets , remember ?
you know i &apos;d never risk emily &apos;s life ,
no matter how much i want her by my side .
well , all the more reason not to hold out hope .
regardless , i &apos;m looking forward to tonight .
the women will come , whether i bid them or not .
like you &apos;ve ever approved of any girl i &apos;ve chosen myself .
for good reason .
conrad &apos;s at the stowaway .
shouldn &apos;t you be there as well ?
yes , but these r.s.v.p.s came to campaign headquarters .
i thought you &apos;d appreciate it if i dropped them off .
ah , the lovely people who &apos;ve bought their way in .
and apparently one who &apos;s been waiting
40 years for the honor .
in addition to the charming message ,
it &apos;s postmarked 1973 .
so either someone &apos;s having a good halloween laugh ,
or the postal service really has outdone itself .
the nausea you &apos;ve been feeling
and the dizziness-- they &apos;re symptoms of pregnancy .
you &apos;re between seven and eight weeks along .
is the baby &apos;s father still in the picture ?
would you like to call your parents ?
i don &apos;t live with them .
you have a choice ahead of you--
one that &apos;s going to affect the rest of your life .
you &apos;re right .
this is just a seasonal trifle ,
not unlike yourself .
so did you get through to nolan ?
i hope so .
i &apos;m worried about him .
i &apos;ve never seen him in such a state .
yeah , that my misjudgment placed him in .
you can &apos;t carry this burden alone , aiden .
i had a hand in this .
well , i was there when padma was taken , emily , not you .
there &apos;s still the smallest chance that she &apos;s alive .
i promised nolan we &apos;d try to find her .
yeah , but in order to do that ,
we have to draw out trask .
and now he &apos;s in possession of carrion ,
he &apos;s gonna lay in wait . we &apos;ve lost our leverage .
not entirely .
we still have one card left to play .
torpedo the initiative &apos;s investments ?
i mean , it &apos;s risky . daniel could fire me .
and then we &apos;ve both lost access to daniel .
it &apos;s now or never , aiden .
i owe it to nolan .
yeah , we both do .
so what &apos;s the occasion ?
well , i know that victoria got the r.s.v.p.
now i just need to make sure she takes it seriously .
i &apos;m just sorry you won &apos;t be at the ball to see your handiwork .
i wouldn &apos;t strike me off your dance card just yet .
how do you plan to protect local business if your platform
includes coastal redistricting and development ?
uh , these people are townies .
are there any of them smart enough to ask that ?
believe it or not , yes .
but to ensure that none of them lobs a grenade ,
i had them presubmit their questions
so you would be prepared , so ...
so a body can &apos;t stand without a healthy backbone .
when i &apos;m elected , i &apos;ll maintain
the working @-@ class stake in ownership
and distribute dividends at all levels .
don &apos;t say &quot; working class . &quot;
i mean , governor &apos;s a job , too .
some of these people aren &apos;t working .
say , uh , say &quot; your . &quot;
i plan to maintain your stake in ownership .
mr. jack porter , everyone ,
the voice of the populace , the voice of reason ,
and the man who helped me close the gap to 4 points .
knock this out of the park ,
and stoddard won &apos;t know what hit him .
make anyone with a mic
feel like they &apos;re the only person in the room .
tap your inner clinton .
i can manage that .
but your inner clinton taps nothing , not anymore .
right , ms. davenport ?
thank god evan won &apos;t be at the masquerade tonight .
nothing could hide those beady eyes .
but you &apos;ll be there , won &apos;t you , jack ?
yeah .
could help us get another cover ,
like the one on the &quot; post &quot; this morning .
i took the liberty of buying masks for you and your brother .
wouldn &apos;t miss it .
conrad , you know , with such a late surge ,
we are ripe for an october surprise .
victoria received a suspicious r.s.v.p. this morning .
it said &quot; expect the unexpected . &quot;
and it was postmarked 1973,
which just happens to be the year your opponent
won his first seat on the community board .
stoddard is trying to rattle us before this event .
which is why we will be in your ear during the q &amp; a.
jack will be there to personalize your responses ,
and i &apos;ll be at the ready in case anyone goes off book .
and , conrad ...
hmm ?
wear a tie .
people want to be able to relate to you ,
not feel like you &apos;re actually related to them .
you are deceptively brilliant .
i learned from the best .
you meant victoria , didn &apos;t you ?
yeah .
ahh .
did you pour all of trask &apos;s funds
into euro @-@ union securities ?
everyone was shorting , and i thought they were wrong .
no , no , no , no , you weren &apos;t thinking .
i have to believe that .
otherwise , you &apos;re trying to destroy my company .
i was taking a gamble , daniel .
that &apos;s the nature of business .
easy to say when your name
isn &apos;t on the damn building .
let me speak to the client .
okay , i &apos;ll accept the blame
and assure him this won &apos;t happen next time .
if we have a next time .
hello ?
emily , it worked .
trask showed .
jack ?
in here .
i &apos;m gone a few weeks .
and you &apos;ve already replaced me with a new b.f.f.
so how do i become a member of this ...
unholy alliance ?
boom . you &apos;re in .
where you been hiding ?
you haven &apos;t returned any of my calls .
before we get into that saga ,
why don &apos;t you tell me yours ?
has conny really converted you into a true believer ?
because , uh , last we spoke ,
you were hell @-@ bent on carrying out amanda &apos;s wishes .
oh , i still am .
but conrad has me coaching him through an earwig
for this town hall meeting .
i wanted to use that opportunity to ...
trip him up .
trip him up ? how ?
that &apos;s where you come in .
nate secretly recorded conrad
practically signing off on amanda &apos;s murder .
let &apos;s say somebody was able to remove
this leverage you &apos;re talking about .
i got it from kenny when i confronted him
about the boat .
can you help me ?
show me the earwig .
victoria ?
apologies for the intrusion .
an intrusion is gracing my foyer unannounced .
i don &apos;t think i have a word for what this is .
you can call it a peace offering .
i was here for charlotte and realized
that i hadn &apos;t seen you in weeks and ...
to ask--
well , hope , actually--
that my invitation to the ball tonight got lost in the mail .
you want to attend ?
it is the event of the season .
well , i &apos;m afraid that no invitation was lost
because none was sent .
daniel has moved on .
and maybe you should , too .
this isn &apos;t about daniel .
well , it may be halloween ,
but certain ghosts are best left outside .
it &apos;s funny .
the last time you spoke of ghosts
was at amanda &apos;s funeral .
how you wanted to protect your children so ...
you don &apos;t outlive them .
did i say that ?
you put it more elegantly , of course .
you said that losing a child
goes against the natural order of things .
well ...
it &apos;s no secret that i &apos;ll do anything for my children .
well , have a lovely evening , victoria .
i &apos;m sorry to miss it .
bold move you made today .
it will have repercussions .
my colleague got ahead of himself .
and you , it would seem .
listen , i &apos;ll get your money back , mr. trask .
there &apos;s no need to hurt anyone , all right ?
why should i do such a thing ?
maybe to back up a threat .
like the one you made to me and my girlfriend .
since you seem to know who we are ,
you should understand that
we don &apos;t threaten in two dimensions .
we act in three .
right , and when you do , you rain down destruction .
whatever horror stories your parents have told you , daniel ,
we &apos;ve evolved .
the world is busy destroying itself .
the real money is in helping rebuild it ,
which is why we &apos;re liquidating our assets in grayson global ,
effectively immediately .
listen , that &apos;s an overreaction .
i can get mathis in line .
i don &apos;t think you can .
there &apos;s more to him than you know .
why ? what &apos;s he up to ?
today ?
opening the door for us to leave your company
and part as gentlemen .
but tomorrow ? he &apos;s your problem .
well , then it &apos;s been a pleasure
doing business with you , mr. trask .
i &apos;m glad you know when to take the win .
daniel .
emily ,
hi .
it &apos;s so good to hear your voice .
is now a good time ?
for what , exactly ?
i haven &apos;t heard from you in six weeks .
i know . i &apos;m--i &apos;m sorry .
but it was all for your protection .
i assumed you were doing it for me .
what changed ?
i took the win .
i want to celebrate with you tonight at the masquerade .
daniel , your mother made it very clear to me
that she didn &apos;t want me there .
well ... i guess we &apos;re lucky her disapproval
will be stuffed behind a mask .
listen , i &apos;m already in the city ,
so i &apos;ll see you there ?
it &apos;s a date .
charlotte , that &apos;s a look i know well .
standing in the present ,
but living in the past .
i was just thinking about amanda .
i just can &apos;t believe she &apos;s gone .
that is something i understand more than you could know .
these just arrived for you , mrs. grayson .
do you want them displayed ?
you can set them on the table , marta . thank you .
black roses ? freaky .
who sent them ?
你亲爱的儿子
they &apos;re just from the florist ,
thanking us for our business .
it &apos;s one rose short .
well , let &apos;s not overlook the thoughtful intent .
a symbol of dying love ?
seems more disturbing than thoughtful .
confirmed .
all funds should be transferred immediately .
accelerate to phase two .
take lexington .
it &apos;s faster this time of day .
unless you know a more direct route to padma lahari .
which my health care plan supports .
i mean , my heart &apos;s with your grandmother , miss dailey ,
and everyone living with alzheimer &apos;s .
i know that she values you there by her bedside ,
teaching her the world as i &apos;m sure she taught you .
i mean , we &apos;re nothing without our families .
and yours is lucky to have two such strong women .
i thank you , eileen , for your question .
mr. grayson ,
this is tom mullen .
uh , mr. mullen ...
tom mullen is the owner of tom &apos;s crab shack .
before you fire away ,
i just want to thank you for the best crab cakes
this town has to offer .
and i &apos;m certainly gonna have
some flown to albany if i ever get homesick .
well , thank you , mr. grayson .
amanda porter was a friend of mine .
and i know we all miss her .
yeah .
so my question is ,
when the truth about jury tampering
in her father &apos;s trial came out ,
you vowed to take action .
what &apos;s your plan , or are you gonna allow the government
to sweep david clarke under the rug again ?
where the hell did that question come from ?
now look , uh ...
let &apos;s say somebody was able
to remove this leverage you &apos;re talking about .
is the deal back on ?
as it stands , mr. ryan ,
that &apos;s a purely hypothetical question .
tom , look ,
i speak for my late wife when i say
i personally asked conrad not to--
no , i &apos;ll--i &apos;ll answer . i &apos;ll answer , jack .
tom , when i &apos;m elected ,
i fully intend to reopen that case .
and if judicial impropriety is proven ,
i will take every appropriate measure
to secure a presidential pardon for david clarke .
next question , please .
i can &apos;t believe that you dragged david clarke
into the conversation one week before the election .
well , i was double tapped with a rogue question .
i gave the only answer i knew would stop their next salvo .
&quot; their &quot; ?
i thought you believed that kenny ryan
was behind the stunt .
yeah , i did .
until i found this .
ashley mentioned that you &apos;d received
a disquieting correspondence this morning ,
and i &apos;m assuming that this was accompanied
by the bouquet of black roses
i found in the garbage downstairs .
&quot; from your loving son . &quot;
well , we can be certain that that &apos;s not daniel .
and here i thought i knew all the skeletons
in your closet by name .
it &apos;s nothing , conrad .
three words that never quell doubt .
victoria , we are this close
from actually having a shot at winning ,
so i &apos;m asking you ...
please .
i was pregnant once .
my mother &apos;s boyfriend-- he ...
victoria , i &apos;m glad you &apos;re here .
so you can take care of it for me ,
and no one will ever know ?
it was the worst time of my life ...
that someone has obviously chosen to haunt me with .
could it be him ?
suffice it to say , that &apos;s not possible .
so the pregnancy was terminated ?
then we &apos;re--we will make it through this ,
victoria , together .
and trust me , i &apos;m gonna ferret out the guilty party .
thank you for understanding , conrad .
i try to keep the ghosts out ...
but they always force their way back in .
i ask again ,
what impact does this chippy &apos;s existence have on anything ?
if you had a conscience , you &apos;d know .
we &apos;re both killers , mr. mathis .
let &apos;s not pretend otherwise .
she got what she wanted .
she &apos;s with her father now .
joined him earlier today .
well , you kept her alive for six weeks .
in preparation for what ?
you &apos;ll know in time . everything has its purpose--
girlfriends , little sisters who love their heroin .
even motion detectors ... can illuminate a room .
and do the same for the authorities ,
which is why , in a few moments ,
the police will find you standing over one dead body .
or if you should choose to pull that trigger , two .
i &apos;m not gonna shoot you .
this is for padma ...
and our fathers ...
and colleen .
they say that life is defined by the roles we play .
and if you &apos;ve joined us this hallowed evening ,
it can only mean that you &apos;ve played them well .
so tonight leave your identities at the door ,
let our spirits inspire yours ,
and may your ornate facades lead you to intrigue .
and as your hosts
and future first lady and governor of this great state ...
let the masquerade commence .
would you say this projects electability ?
more so than the man behind it .
is it possible i wasn &apos;t clear when we spoke earlier ?
actually , it turns out that daniel asked me to be his date .
but if it bothers you , victoria ,
you can pretend that i left emily thorne at the door .
to a lovely evening .
thank you for helping jack tonight
and for making my father &apos;s case a campaign promise .
i can &apos;t believe conrad grayson just got my vote .
well , i know you &apos;ve got all your moves mapped out ,
but i saw a chance , and i took it .
i hope that &apos;s okay .
it &apos;s more than okay , nolan .
thank you .
who knew the porter brothers could pull off masks ?
that &apos;s exactly what i want to do is pull this thing off .
sometimes self @-@ deception can be therapeutic .
so can free grub . who &apos;s coming with me ?
can &apos;t have champagne wishes without caviar dreams .
i heard about what you did for amanda today .
it was really wonderful .
just looking for justice where it &apos;s due .
are you okay ?
yeah . i &apos;m okay . thank you .
there she is .
i &apos;m glad you joined me tonight .
you , too , porter , and thank you
for all you &apos;ve done on my father &apos;s behalf .
somehow , you got him electable and out of my way .
but if you don &apos;t mind ,
emily and i have six weeks to catch up on , so ...
no , no . no , no .
look , david clarke isn &apos;t even a first @-@ term concern .
no , ensuring that your taxes don &apos;t go up is .
yeah , thanks . thanks , scott .
don &apos;t worry . it &apos;s nonalcoholic .
i &apos;ll be totally alert when we get the polling tomorrow .
my assumption is that you were sober this afternoon ,
and now i &apos;m missing the masquerade to field calls
from anxious supporters .
someone &apos;s got nate &apos;s tapes ,
either kenny or jack porter--
neither of whom possesses the sophistication for such a ploy .
to say nothing of the fact that jack actually came to my defense .
or maybe it &apos;s someone who canvassed for stoddard
when he was in college .
namely , your campaign manager evan spradlin ,
who we know paid kenny off in exchange for his silence .
you know , the sound ...
of you shilling these self @-@ serving theories
reminds me of your protestations of bewilderment
in the wake of the mothers and daughters united event last year .
so either you &apos;re the fox in the hen house ,
or you &apos;re desperately bad at protecting it .
then fire me .
what , this late in the campaign ?
i will say that once i &apos;m elected ,
you can add this to your long list of jobs that you can &apos;t handle .
i didn &apos;t mean to startle you , mrs. grayson .
sloane , it &apos;s so nice to see a friendly face .
i &apos;m so glad you accepted my invitation .
i was , too ,
until i saw danny back on the arm of the ice queen .
well , i always thought the two of you were a much better fit .
give them a few days . they &apos;ll have parted ways again .
then i guess you haven &apos;t seen it .
reunited and it feels so good
excuse me .
&quot; page six . &quot; is this your idea of a joke ?
do you realize the perilous implications of being together ?
you mean the threat ?
yes , daniel , i do .
do you honestly believe that woman is worth your life ?
well , luckily , that &apos;s not a choice i have to make .
and i do believe these are yours .
feel free to use one for each of your two faces .
where have you been ? what happened with trask ?
he &apos;s at the bottom of the east river .
he killed colleen ... and padma .
well , well . every opera needs its phantom .
nolan , we should , uh , we should take a walk outside .
why ?
padma ?
nolan , i &apos;m so sorry .
six weeks of holding out hope .
i &apos;m such an idiot .
nolan , please stop .
these people-- they just ...
she got dragged into this because of me .
i am to blame .
no , you &apos;re not .
yes , i am , and so are you and everyone else that let this happen !
you &apos;re right . i &apos;m sorry .
i ju-- i loved her .
she loved you .
she &apos;s gone .
em , she &apos;s gone .
you ... you need ... you have to get back in there .
no , this doesn &apos;t matter anymore .
yes ... ems , it does .
i &apos;m not leaving you alone , nolan .
i love you , too .
i just ... i have to deal with this on my own .
i &apos;ll be okay . i , uh , i promise .
couldn &apos;t they at least have made it a real costume party ?
like you wouldn &apos;t have still slutted it up ?
no , you moron . just to rattle these corpses ,
i would &apos;ve come as amanda clarke .
though i guess that is slutting it up .
truth .
is it also true that the baby only survived the fall
&apos;cause she was rocking a tequila placenta ?
shut up , regina .
sorry , harlot . i &apos;m kidding .
i mean , everyone knows that drugs made amanda think she could fly .
charlotte ! what just happened ?
you okay ?
hey , no , no . you guys gotta go . now . go .
what happened ? are you okay ?
you wouldn &apos;t believe what they were saying .
those two aren &apos;t worth it . you gotta let it go .
i want to , but i can &apos;t .
come here .
i didn &apos;t know if you &apos;d be coming back or not .
believe it or not , nolan forced me .
well , he knows you as well as you him .
are you ready for this ?
i will be .
so you and daniel are back together .
not officially . he was just my way in tonight .
well , he may disagree with you .
your picture &apos;s on &quot; page six . &quot;
daniel &apos;s clever .
there &apos;s no turning back once you go public .
daniel .
i bumped into emily on my way in ,
and naturally i inferred that you two got back together ,
which she confirmed , so congratulations .
well , at least you had good instincts about something today , right ?
just kidding , mathis .
i hope this isn &apos;t too awkward for you .
no , all is fair in love and war , as they say .
so can i get either of you a cocktail ?
oh , we &apos;re good , but help yourself .
my family spared no expense .
thank you .
ruling with a velvet fist ?
i &apos;m not letting him out of my sight
until i know what he &apos;s up to .
hey , enough work talk .
tonight ... you &apos;re all i care about .
refill , please .
thank you for having me , mrs. grayson .
it &apos;s a lovely party . everybody seems to be having a great time .
i heard charlotte hit somebody .
must be that blue @-@ collar influence
her father &apos;s so keen to embrace .
mr. grayson did a remarkable job at the town hall meeting today .
you mean by endorsing the quest for david clarke &apos;s pardon ?
well , that would be a victory for your late wife .
there &apos;s no victory for amanda .
she &apos;s gone ,
which is why my child &apos;s being raised without a mother .
you realize the decision you make is permanent .
victoria , are you okay ?
well , we actually got a small bump
in the liberal enclaves from this david clarke thing .
one can infer that they really do value justice above all .
who has the polling from the northern districts ?
uh , yeah . you took a hit .
i wasn &apos;t aware that you were working from home today .
well , i wanted to be here for you , my dear .
excuse us .
and keep making those calls .
someone &apos;s responsible for what happened yesterday .
i want a name .
you feeling better ?
yes , thank you .
coffee ?
tea ? muffin ?
you may need your strength while you &apos;re explaining
what could possibly have happened to you last night
that you wound up unconscious on the ballroom floor .
i was upset
because our son has once again put his life on the line
and our daughter has been throwing punches at party guests .
and after you browbeat me
into reliving memories that were best laid to rest ,
it &apos;s no wonder i fainted .
or could it be that
you &apos;ve lied to me about the pregnancy
you claim to have terminated ?
you want proof ?
i want something i can believe .
fine . i &apos;ll give it to you ,
but you will never speak of this again .
i didn &apos;t hear from you
so i assume you were either with nolan or daniel .
i talked to nolan .
he said he made it through the night okay .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m here .
i hate that it has to be this way .
you hate it ?
well , if it were up to me , i &apos;d put a bullet in his head .
well , it &apos;s not up to you .
clearly .
and you know that daniel is not my focus .
victoria is .
you can &apos;t be jealous of somebody that i don &apos;t even care about--
i &apos;m not jealous , emily . i &apos;m disgusted .
but i &apos;m gonna deal with it the best i can .
well , like it or not , you &apos;re gonna have to deal with daniel .
trask must have said something ,
because he &apos;s looking into your past .
i &apos;ve done my due diligence .
you can &apos;t erase your father , aiden .
and if daniel turns to the falcon , he could learn everything .
now i &apos;ve killed trask ,
he &apos;s our only way of finding out what phase two is .
well , then we have to get to him before daniel does .
right .
or it could threaten my time in the hamptons .
i &apos;m tracking victoria &apos;s cell phone signal .
looks like we &apos;re all heading into the city .
yeah .
but separately .
i got your text . what &apos;d you want to talk about ?
i &apos;ll see you in a second , buddy , okay ?
be right back .
i heard the way conrad talked to you at the party .
just a bad day on the campaign trail .
i doubt that .
have they ever treated you well ?
charlotte told me the graysons banished you ,
and you had to come back on your own . is that true ?
so ?
so i think that we &apos;re in this for the same thing--
to get what we can from conrad
before we take him down .
the only reason you &apos;d suspect kenny ryan of what happened yesterday
is if you knew what nate did to my wife for conrad &apos;s benefit .
you played the tape ? you placed the question ?
and you know why i did ?
because when he becomes governor , where does it end ?
i need ... your help .
and i know you &apos;re not one of them .
and what happened with amanda--
you have to know that i was not involved .
we wouldn &apos;t be standing here if you were .
so you with me ?
destroying evidence ?
when we questioned you , you claimed to know nothing .
after seeing ... this , it &apos;s hard to believe ,
especially when the coroner said she died yesterday .
yesterday ?
i spoke to you in the morning .
your colleagues say that you left there soon after . where &apos;d you go ?
i &apos;m not saying a word .
thank you for seeing me , sister .
you realize that the decision you make is permanent
and that a vow is sacrosanct .
once taken , i shall never break it .
i do , sister .
then i promise to find your son the best possible home
and never to tell him who his mother is .
you forgot the last promise .
i didn &apos;t .
i want you to be sure .
then i promise never to tell you what becomes of him .
i kept those promises , victoria ,
even when he came for you those years ago .
and he hasn &apos;t come again .
when you saw him , did he seem happy ?
he was a young man looking for his mother ,
which is a quest of hope .
so take from that what you will .
thank you , sister .
for everything .
what can i do for you , my dear ?
sister , i need your help .
i &apos;m pregnant
and i have nowhere else to go .
