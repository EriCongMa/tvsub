here you go .
thank you .
&quot; say , rachel ...
... i was wondering if you &apos;d go to a movie with me sometime ...
... as my lover . &quot;
too out there .
&quot; maybe you &apos;d like to have dinner with me sometime ...
... as my lover . &quot;
all right , let &apos;s go shopping .
l got a positive balance on my credit card l want to use before citibank goes under .
good idea . good idea .
before we go , there &apos;s something i need to say .
i &apos;ve kind of had this crush on you .
since you were with ross , i didn &apos;t do anything about it .
now that you &apos;re not , i &apos;d really like to ask you out sometime .
so that &apos;s what i &apos;m doing ...
... now .
i dropped a cup .
the one with the tiny t @-@ shirt
so within a few years , voice recognition ...
... will be standard on any computer .
you know , so you could be , like , &quot; wash my car . &quot; &quot; clean my room . &quot;
it won &apos;t be able to do any of those things , but it &apos;ll understand .
wow . would it be able to recognize my voice if l talked like this ?
oh , yeah. lt &apos;ll understand you , but it &apos;s gonna make fun of you .
oh , this was so great .
yeah , it was .
all right , then .
bye .
hello , people who do not live here .
i gave you a key for emergencies .
we were out of doritos .
hey , how &apos;d the date go with mr. millionaire ?
&quot; mr. millionaire . new , from snooty playthings .
third wife sold separately . &quot;
he &apos;s great . we have such a good time together .
he &apos;s so funny and so sweet . and i &apos;m not attracted to him at all !
still ?
it &apos;s driving me crazy . in every other way , he &apos;s the perfect guy .
he has everything . plus , he actually has everything .
life @-@ sized lmperial storm troopers from sharper lmage ?
two .
can joey and i put them on and fight ?
oh , mommy ! oh , daddy ! i am a big old baddy
oh , mommy ! oh , daddy ! i am a big old baddy
i guess he must &apos;ve gotten the part in that play .
either that , or gloria estefan was right .
eventually , the rhythm is going to get you .
joe , how &apos;s it going ?
good .
so you &apos;re playing adrianne ?
yes . are you one of the retarded cousins ?
no . i &apos;m playing your husband , victor . i &apos;m joey tribbiani .
hi . nice to meet you . kate miller .
so the play &apos;s pretty great , huh ?
oh , yeah . i love jennifer banberry &apos;s work .
she &apos;s so incisive when it comes to deconstructing the middle class .
oh , forget about it . she rocks !
where do i know you from ?
dr. drake ramoray ?
days of our lives ?
voted most datable neurosurgeon by teen beat ? .
no , that &apos;s not it .
so you &apos;re a soap actor .
this must be exciting for you , being in a real play .
hey , i &apos;ve done plays before . i &apos;m a serious actor .
that infomercial !
for the milk @-@ carton @-@ spout thing !
you &apos;re the guy who doesn &apos;t know how to pour milk !
i actually can pour milk . but i got you believing that i couldn &apos;t .
now , see , that &apos;s acting .
right . at the end , you choked on a cookie .
that was real .
i cannot believe mark asked you out .
i know .
what are you gonna tell him ?
i told him i would think about it , but i &apos;m gonna tell him no .
i think i &apos;d say no to anybody right now .
but it was so strange . i mean , i &apos;m standing there ...
... with this charming , cute guy who &apos;s asking me to go out with him ...
... which i &apos;m allowed to do ...
... and i felt guilty , like i &apos;d be cheating on ross or something .
wow . so , okay , maybe that means ...
... you &apos;re not over ross yet and you have issues with your father .
i don &apos;t have issues with my father .
so it &apos;s just the ross thing .
i hate this woman ! i hate her !
she told everyone about that infomercial ...
... and now they all keep asking me to open their drinks !
and whenever i can &apos;t do it , they &apos;re all , like , laughing at me !
so rachel called .
wants to see me .
going over in a minute .
what do you think she wants ?
maybe the crazy fog has lifted ...
... and she realizes that life without me ...
... sucks .
it &apos;s possible . you are very lovable . i &apos;d miss you if i broke up with you .
just trying to be supportive .
be supportive like a guy .
if i broke up with you , i &apos;d miss you .
you wanted to see me ?
here &apos;s a box of your stuff .
it &apos;s just hats and a shirt and cd &apos;s . just stuff that you &apos;ve left here .
what are you doing ? are you trying to hurt me or something ?
it just seems that , you know , it &apos;s time we move on .
i mean , don &apos;t you think ?
yes , i do .
good .
i really do .
this was a gift .
you got that for free from the museum gift shop .
it &apos;s still a gift .
i got it from the &quot; gift &quot; shop .
okay ! all right ! give me the mug ! i &apos;ll keep the mug !
don &apos;t do me any favors .
in fact ...
... where &apos;s the rest of my stuff ? like my ....
this book is mine !
and that t @-@ shirt you sleep in ? i &apos;d like that back too . yes , i do .
you know how much i love that t @-@ shirt . you never even wear that t @-@ shirt .
i &apos;m just trying to help you &quot; move on . &quot;
oh , you are a petty man .
you are a petty , petty ...
petty ... - ... petty , petty ...
... small .... - ... small ....
you are so just doing this out of spite .
i &apos;m gonna wear this all the time ! i love this shirt !
you haven &apos;t worn it since you were 15 ! it doesn &apos;t even fit you anymore !
if you don &apos;t mind , i &apos;m gonna take the rest of my stuff ...
... and &quot; relax ... &quot;
... in my favorite shirt .
you have a pleasant evening .
so you &apos;re , like , a zillionaire .
and you &apos;re our age . you &apos;re our age .
you know what ? you should buy a state ...
... and then just name it after yourself .
like , &quot; pete dakota &quot; ?
or &quot; mississi @-@ pete . &quot;
i got it : &quot; pete chicago . &quot;
that &apos;s not a state , joe .
oh , and &quot; mississi @-@ pete &quot; is ?
i gotta go .
i &apos;ll see you guys later .
you &apos;re our age .
so are we on for tomorrow ?
absolutely .
now , get out of here , you !
okay , i &apos;m running out of places i can touch him .
is something wrong with me ?
why am i only attracted to guys with no future ?
either they &apos;re too old , or they &apos;re too young .
or they &apos;re a big misogynist jerk poet like julio .
who , by the way , l &apos;m still attracted to .
and there &apos;s pete , who &apos;s crazy about me ...
... and he &apos;s absolutely perfect , and there &apos;s zip going on !
does it sound like something &apos;s wrong with me ?
yeah , kind of .
happy ? is that what i &apos;m supposed to be , vic ?
happy ?
why don &apos;t you tell me what you &apos;re supposed to be ?
because i sure as hell can &apos;t figure it out !
i talk to you , and nothing !
you look at me , and it &apos;s nothing !
nothing .
tasty .
i &apos;m really starting to feel like you guys have a history . it &apos;s nice .
i have a question about this scene .
i don &apos;t understand why adrianne &apos;s attracted to victor .
peel the onion .
first of all , he &apos;s good @-@ looking .
my character needs a bit more of a reason than that .
hey , how about this one ? it says so in the script !
i don &apos;t know why my character likes you either .
i mean , it says in the script that you &apos;re a bitch .
lt doesn &apos;t say that in the script .
lt does in mine .
i can blow @-@ dry it , gel it . it doesn &apos;t matter .
i still wind up with this little ...
... cowlick @-@ y thing on the middle part of my head . it &apos;s so annoying .
does it bug you ?
you bug me .
is there any chance you didn &apos;t see that ?
ross , you gotta stop , okay ?
you can &apos;t stare through the peephole for three hours .
you &apos;re gonna get peep @-@ eye .
i knew it . i knew it . i always knew she liked him .
she &apos;d say no , but here we are . we just broke up , first thing she does !
you didn &apos;t &quot; just break up . &quot;
it &apos;s been , like , three weeks !
you slept with somebody three hours after you thought you broke up .
i mean , bullets have left guns slower .
here they come ! here they
if she kisses him good night , i &apos;ll kill myself .
i can &apos;t watch .
come on . date over ! date over !
here we go . she &apos;s going in .
she &apos;s going in .
wait ! he &apos;s going in !
he &apos;s going in !
the door &apos;s closed ! i can &apos;t see anything with the door closed !
and the inventor of the door rests happily in his grave .
i have to do something . i have to stop it !
stop what ?
i don &apos;t know .
but i have a feeling my being there will do it .
look , this guy is bad news , chandler.l can sense he &apos;s an operator .
rachel wouldn &apos;t date an operator .
they only make 20 grand a year and they have to work nights .
i &apos;ll go over and i will borrow something !
juice ! i need juice !
you can &apos;t !
they must be stopped !
i am your friend ...
... and i won &apos;t let you do this !
you are surprisingly strong !
i need juice ! people need juice !
look , man ....
people need juice !
listen to me !
she &apos;s moving on . if it &apos;s not this guy , it &apos;s gonna be somebody else .
and unless you &apos;re thinking about subletting my peephole ...
... you &apos;ll have to get used to the fact that it &apos;s over !
okay , man ? it &apos;s over .
it &apos;s just i miss her so much .
i know .
i know .
ls it just me , or did &quot; subletting my peephole &quot; sound kind of dirty ?
why do your coffee mugs have numbers ?
oh , that &apos;s so monica can keep track .
so if one of them &apos;s missing , she can be like , &quot; where &apos;s number 27 ? &quot;
you know what ?
no , and i don &apos;t think i &apos;m gonna want to .
i can &apos;t do this .
that &apos;s what i didn &apos;t want to know .
oh , i &apos;m just doing this for the wrong reasons , you know ?
i &apos;m doing it to get back at ross .
i &apos;m sorry . it &apos;s not very fair to you .
fair , shmair . you know ?
you wanna get back at ross , i am here for you .
really .
i say we get back at him right here on this couch . right here !
oh , my god .
i &apos;m sorry about this .
that &apos;s okay .
you sure ?
i can just go home and get back at him by myself .
and should become the penicillin of the 2.1st century .
and so today , this hospital is about to take major steps ...
... toward leading that revolution .
can i ask you something ?
where are we ?
well , with all these doctors and nurses ...
... i &apos;m gonna say , &quot; midget rodeo . &quot;
just tell me the truth .
you know , i don &apos;t think i told you this ...
... but i just recently got out of a serious relationship .
oh , right . wasn &apos;t that a year ago ?
so i did tell you .
that &apos;s not really the thing .
i &apos;m just in a place in my life where i need to focus on me .
do you know what i mean ?
oh , i know .
i so want to be attracted to you .
but you &apos;re not . okay . good .
i &apos;m sorry .
you know what ? don &apos;t be .
don &apos;t be , because it &apos;s not so bad .
it &apos;s not ?
yeah . i know i &apos;m no jon bon jovi .
or someone you find attractive .
i just think , you know ...
... that you might end up feeling differently .
i don &apos;t want this to come out wrong ...
... but you &apos;re awfully confident for a guy i said i wasn &apos;t attracted to .
stupidly charming , isn &apos;t it ?
you wanna get something to eat ? this place is kind of depressing .
now the man who made all of this possible , mr. peter becker .
one second .
i don &apos;t think this town is big enough for the both of us to relax in .
draw !
i wasn &apos;t doing anything .
what did she do now ?
just because she went to yale , she thinks she &apos;s the greatest actress ...
... since sliced bread .
ah , sliced bread . a wonderful lady macbeth .
i hate her . i hate her with her &quot; oh , i &apos;m so talented ... &quot;
... and &quot; oh , i &apos;m so pretty , &quot; and &quot; oh , i smell so good . &quot;
i think somebody has a crush on somebody .
can we please try and stay focused on my problem here ?
i &apos;m talking about you , you big , big freak .
you &apos;re out of your mind !
you &apos;ve done nothing but talk about her for 48 hours .
if you were in school , you &apos;d be pulling her pigtails and pushing her down now .
then how come i keep thinking about her ...
... in all these sexual scenarios and stuff ?
happy ? is that what i &apos;m supposed to be , vic ? happy ?
why don &apos;t you tell me what you &apos;re supposed to be , huh ?
because i sure as hell can &apos;t figure it out .
i talk to you , and it &apos;s nothing .
you look at me , and nothing .
nothing .
you guys make me fly !
high !
okay , we &apos;re gonna pick it up here , tomorrow .
well , that was ....
better ?
yeah , it was definitely ...
... an improvement .
good night .
kate .
you forgot your shoes .
i &apos;m probably gonna need those , huh ?
hey , listen ...
... you feel like getting a cup of coffee ?
kate ...
... you ready to go ?
very nice . very nice .
see you tomorrow ?
yeah . sure .
right .
good night .
why isn &apos;t it &quot; spiderman &quot; ?
like goldman , silverman ?
because it &apos;s not his last name .
it isn &apos;t ?
it &apos;s not , like ...
... phil spiderman .
he &apos;s a spider- ...
... man .
you know , like , goldman is a last name .
but there &apos;s no gold man .
there should be a gold man !
how was work ?
oh , great .
although i did sit down where there wasn &apos;t a chair .
by the way , ross dropped by a box of your stuff .
oh . well , i guess i had that one coming .
i &apos;m just gonna throw it out . it &apos;s probably just shampoo and
something wrong ?
no . nothing .
so what kind of powers would &quot; gold man &quot; have ?
okay . well , he would turn things to gold .
and things that are already gold ?
his work is done .
okay , l have a friend , jimmy tupperman , what would his powers be ?
tupper man .
he would keep criminals fresh until the police came .
let &apos;s play my game .
all right , you yellow @-@ bellied , lily @-@ livered
