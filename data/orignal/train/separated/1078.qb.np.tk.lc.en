the hope diamond . we &apos;re looking for its twin .
they want me in d.c. ?
the job &apos;s yours .
when we first started talking about washington ,
i reached out to the national gallery .
they just called me and offered me a position .
i made a call to bruce in washington .
he &apos;s meeting with the fbi director to put your release in motion .
you asked me to trust you .
you can trust me .
who is she , neal ?
her real name is rachel turner , mi5 .
neal , she &apos;s in love with you .
we found it .
rebecca !
don &apos;t come any closer .
where are you going ?
he &apos;s gone , and he &apos;s not coming back .
every law enforcement officer in new york
is headed here right now .
you have to stop running .
the fbi director won &apos;t release you
&apos;cause you &apos;re such a big asset .
the bureau doesn &apos;t want to lose you .
and now you don &apos;t want to go to d.c.
it &apos;s all bureaucracy , el .
i &apos;ll commute back and forth .
i want my freedom .
give me a week , and we &apos;ll be back in business .
why are you following me ? who are you ?
i &apos;m about to become the last person on earth who knows where you are .
all clear .
turn over every mattress .
check behind every frame .
doesn &apos;t look like a man who planned to leave .
neal wouldn &apos;t have left any clues .
he and mozzie should be long gone by now .
i know it &apos;s not a perfect resemblance ,
but we ca--
this looks like a bad time .
i &apos;ll come back later .
stay right where you are , mozzie .
i can explain , suit .
i &apos;m so very lonely .
you &apos;re gonna tell me where he is .
i know all your interrogation techniques , suit .
i &apos;m never gonna crack .
i &apos;m also aided by the fact that i have no idea
what you &apos;re talking about .
we both know neal ran .
of course we do .
now , where exactly do we know he ran to ?
that &apos;s what you &apos;re gonna tell me .
the answer , dear suit , is that he didn &apos;t run .
and the evidence is right in front of you .
you ?
he wouldn &apos;t run without me ,
ergo ...
we found the anklet .
it was in the back of a truck headed to pennsylvania .
thanks , jones .
ergo ?
12 : 52 p.m. , neal cut his anklet .
he &apos;s gone .
you &apos;re gonna tell me where he went .
whoa , whoa , whoa , 12 : 52 p.m. today ?
that &apos;s right .
that &apos;s impossible .
i was with him minutes before .
we were talking about ...
the future .
i bet you were .
i saw the body double .
the fbi betrayed him .
what else would you expect ?
you &apos;re not helping your case .
we wouldn &apos;t do it like this .
if we ever ran , it would be a well @-@ crafted plan--
no loose ends--
together .
suit , you know something doesn &apos;t feel right about this .
i promise you , neal didn &apos;t run ...
which means someone must have taken him .
thank you .
excuse me ?
i was gonna run , but , you know ,
figuring out how to dodge the fbi ,
get rid of the anklet ,
find an untraceable place to lay low--
that takes time .
instead , you took care of it already , so thank you .
this is the best thing that could have happened to me .
you know you &apos;re cuffed to a chair , right ?
i do , but i won &apos;t be once you realize
the opportunity in front of you .
yeah , she said you were good .
rebecca .
well , she didn &apos;t have any friends ,
no one she trusted .
she told you about me , she needed you .
you &apos;re the guy in the helicopter .
rebecca reached out to me--
a cut of the diamond for a way out of town .
and you really thought rebecca would give that to you ?
i don &apos;t think either of us expected the other
to keep up our end of the bargain .
now i don &apos;t have to .
you want the whole thing for yourself .
and you are going to get it for me .
getting a little tired of how happy you are .
the fbi has the diamond .
but you work for the fbi .
she told me that too .
you can get it from them .
and what &apos;s the value of it then ?
no one &apos;s gonna touch something that hot .
you can &apos;t sell it .
who says i want to ?
this isn &apos;t a conversation .
more of a &quot; you do what i say ,
or i push you down the elevator shaft . &quot;
you keep checking your watch .
you &apos;re playing calm , but you &apos;re sweating .
and instead of threatening me in increments--
fingers , toes , that kind of thing--
you &apos;re going straight for the drop .
you &apos;re on a clock .
question is , whose clock are you on ?
yeah .
prisoner should be here any minute , boss .
thanks , diana .
how are you holding up ?
i &apos;m torn between being afraid mozzie &apos;s right
and hoping he is .
what do you think ?
i think mozzie would rather be anywhere but here ,
and the fact that he &apos;s still around says a lot .
does he know who we &apos;re bringing in ?
no .
we need to keep it that way .
don &apos;t use our own listening devices on us .
it &apos;s rude .
well , someone has to do something .
this is the problem with bureaucracy .
it takes far too long to discover the truth--
i believe you .
then why are we standing here ?
we have to find who took him .
we will .
you go home .
you let me know if you hear anything
from your side of the world .
what ?
you want me to leave .
very much so .
which is why i should stay .
mozzie .
what are you hiding from me ?
of course . it was rebecca .
she has the most reason to hurt neal .
which is why we &apos;re gonna talk to her .
excellent . i &apos;ll lead the interrogation .
you aren &apos;t going anywhere near her .
she tried to kill you .
which is why i will be a properly motivated bad cop .
no .
there &apos;s too much on the line .
peter , you need me .
mozzie , you need to trust me .
tell woodford i need more time .
i know i--
no .
i &apos;ll have it .
no more talking .
you &apos;re going to get me that diamond .
you don &apos;t need it .
or maybe i just cut my losses .
okay , you &apos;re trying to join the pink panthers .
look , i heard you mention woodford .
he &apos;s rumored to be the head of the pink panthers ,
the greatest thieves of our time .
to join the group , you need a heist as an offering .
i think you told them you &apos;d deliver the diamond .
then you understand my problem .
i met with the panthers . i saw their faces .
now i either join them or die .
there &apos;s always another way .
what , i steal something else ?
no . we steal something else .
neal &apos;s been kidnapped .
well , if you think i did it ,
you &apos;ve got far too much faith in me .
i don &apos;t think you did it ,
but you may know who grabbed him .
you &apos;re gonna tell me who it is you &apos;re smiling about .
for the right price .
you want us to let you go ?
get an anklet ? help us find neal ?
i &apos;d settle for a room with a view in a low @-@ security prison ,
but if you &apos;re offering ...
i &apos;m not .
here &apos;s what i &apos;m offering ...
nothing .
so why would i help you ?
my wife is moving to washington--
left today , actually .
congratulations ?
she &apos;s moving there , and i &apos;m staying here .
it &apos;s gonna be hard on us .
it &apos;s my fault .
she got a job in washington
because i was being transferred there ,
but then i decided to stay .
cold feet ?
neal .
he was supposed to get a deal for his freedom .
it fell through . i stayed .
so you chose neal over your wife .
i chose to do what &apos;s right .
so that &apos;s your angle here ?
you want me to do what &apos;s right ?
you have no sense of right or wrong .
i know that .
so what &apos;s this all about , agent burke ?
you may be a cold , calculating murderer ,
but i know you love neal .
both of us would do whatever it takes
for the people we love .
and deep down ,
i think you realize this may be all your fault ,
but it doesn &apos;t have to be .
there &apos;s still time to save neal .
so no deals .
i will , however , offer you an opportunity .
i &apos;ll fix this for you ...
but you need to give me a name .
whatever the heist is needs to impress woodford
even more than the diamond .
that &apos;s not an easy task .
how much time do we have ?
24 hours--
not enough time to scout a location
and prep for a heist .
unless it &apos;s somewhere you &apos;ve already scouted .
is woodford here in new york ?
either my plan works ,
or i fall down this elevator shaft .
it doesn &apos;t hurt to tell me .
he &apos;s here .
working out of the kessman building .
you think robbing the head of the pink panthers
will get me in ? are you insane ?
you promised something incredible ,
to prove you &apos;re as good as they are , and you failed .
now you have to show you &apos;re better than them .
you have to rob the robbers .
why should i trust you ?
i meant what i said earlier .
i need to leave town .
if rebecca contacted you ,
it means you can provide a way out .
i can .
then this is a simple business arrangement .
i help you , you help me .
all right , how about a gesture of faith ?
it &apos;d have to be a hell of a gesture .
any minute now , the fbi is gonna storm into this building .
we need to be out of here before they do .
they &apos;ll never find this place .
you did a great job of getting off the grid ,
but peter burke is leading the investigation .
he &apos;ll find me .
we &apos;re lucky he isn &apos;t already here .
look , if i wanted to go back to that life , i &apos;d stall ,
buy my time with promises and lies
until burke breaks down that door .
but i don &apos;t want to go back .
your options are prison , death , or trusting me .
what &apos;s it gonna be ?
fbi ! go , go , go , go , go !
fbi !
go ! go !
go , go !
back &apos;s clear .
clear !
damn it .
partners ?
someone was just here .
not of their own free will .
rebecca said she made contact with a man named boothe .
jones is running background on him now .
you think he wanted the diamond ?
if it was him , i &apos;d guess so .
hey , hey , hey , i &apos;m with the band .
it &apos;s all right . let him in .
see , i told you .
vindication .
if you &apos;d listened to me sooner , suit--
there &apos;s no evidence yet .
we &apos;re running some tests to see if neal was here .
if his captor was any good , he &apos;d have wiped everything down .
maybe not everything .
what do you see ?
wood shavings .
why would there be wood shavings ?
he didn &apos;t make them trying to set himself free .
neal knew you &apos;d find this place .
kessman .
kessman building , downtown .
that could be where they took neal .
it &apos;s not the kind of place you take a captive .
it &apos;s the kind of place you rob .
the kessman building--
the offices are owned by a who &apos;s who
of the overly rich and powerful .
why would neal lead us there ?
jones , what do we have on the suspect ?
jim boothe-- he &apos;s a thief for hire .
a couple of high @-@ profile smash @-@ and @-@ grabs in europe ,
a ruby heist from the burj khalifa in dubai .
usually works alone .
so we have a thief not known for kidnapping
and a building that &apos;s more target than safe house .
what am i missing here ?
this is usually where neal says something .
look where that &apos;s gotten him .
neal knows where he &apos;s headed ...
not typical of a captive .
you think they &apos;re working together ?
i &apos;m saying he may have adapted to the situation at hand .
so boothe wants a treasure he can &apos;t get .
neal redirects him to something he can .
who in this building would have that something ?
it &apos;s target @-@ rich .
there are over 60 tenants in the building .
it could be any one of them .
yeah .
all right , if we can &apos;t narrow it down to who ,
let &apos;s figure out how he &apos;s getting in .
how would you break in ?
nice try .
i know a trap when i see one .
look , mozzie , it &apos;s not a trap .
i tell you how i &apos;d do it ,
then you arrest me for intent to commit a crime .
aren &apos;t you a lawyer ?
you do know that isn &apos;t how it works , right ?
what &apos;s the security like ?
it &apos;s top @-@ notch-- guards at all entrance points ,
thermal i.d. and corneal scanners
to activate the elevators .
for this to work , woodford can &apos;t know you &apos;re going in .
that means we can &apos;t con our way up .
if the lobby &apos;s impregnable ...
that means i &apos;d go in through the roof .
yeah , but you &apos;d still need to get past the elevators .
security &apos;s focused on keeping people
from getting up , but elevators have to go down .
fire code is a thief &apos;s best friend .
so we wait for night and make our move .
no . day .
when everyone can see us ?
well , at night , security &apos;s on high alert .
during the day , they won &apos;t be patrolling the offices .
motion sensors will be off .
so how do we get to the roof ?
pull a man on wire .
in 1974 , philippe petit used a bow and arrow
to shoot a cable between the world trade center towers .
then he tightrope walked across it .
but today &apos;s security has a man on every rooftop .
we &apos;d never make it .
so then what ?
i &apos;d need a faster option .
bring up the image of the building .
please .
can you zoom into the left image ?
ah , bingo .
shoot an arrow from that building
past the kessman to the building on the other side .
then it &apos;s just a simple zip line down ,
drop onto the roof , and i &apos;m in ?
that &apos;s right .
and i &apos;ll keep an eye on the rooftop guard
from the second building .
one problem .
i don &apos;t have the equipment for something like that .
i know just the guy .
what &apos;s his name ?
i can &apos;t tell you that .
why not ?
neal told us to go to the kessman building ,
not to rat out a trusted ally .
mozzie , right now we &apos;re following bread crumbs .
we need to get ahead of this
so we know what we &apos;re dealing with .
neal led us to the building . he has a plan .
and i don &apos;t work by neal &apos;s plans .
suit !
no , mozzie , no more excuses !
if you want me to keep neal alive ,
you &apos;re gonna give me that name .
fat charlie .
his name is fat charlie .
and you &apos;re gonna take me to him .
i get it now .
what &apos;s that ?
why neal likes working with you .
with every new case , he gets to think
of how he would commit the crime .
he gets the thrill of invention without the threat of jail time .
maybe i &apos;ll put an anklet on you next .
i would gnaw my leg off .
oh , listen ...
fat charlie is kind of a tricky guy to deal with ,
so you should really let me take the lead , okay ?
by all means .
mozzie , what do you need ?
you fat charlie ?
yeah .
really ?
yeah . who the hell are you ?
here &apos;s the deal--
disappear for 24 hours , don &apos;t tell a single person ,
and i &apos;ll forget i ever saw this place .
go .
what the hell was that ?
we don &apos;t have time to protect your relationships .
uh , ignoring that , that was fat charlie .
what happens when boothe and neal come looking for him ?
boothe , i &apos;d like you to meet ...
an old friend of mine .
hello , neal .
you &apos;re fat charlie ?
i am .
where &apos;s the rest of you ?
never heard that one before .
who &apos;s this guy ?
someone new i &apos;m working with .
it &apos;s good to see you .
you know i &apos;m always here for you .
how can i help ?
what &apos;s happening now ?
peter &apos;s giving neal an opportunity to pass a message--
if boothe has backup , hidden gun ,
anything we need to know before we move in .
neal has a plan .
we &apos;re interrupting it .
what if he doesn &apos;t want peter moving in ?
he &apos;d need a damn good reason not to .
oh , you care to make a wager on it ?
what ?
if i &apos;m right
and peter lets neal continue with his plan ,
i get to ask you a single question
that you must answer honestly .
deal .
and if i &apos;m right , you never set foot in this van again .
easiest bet i ever made .
let me take a look .
all right .
we &apos;re good .
all right .
bunker buster arrow , primer cord ...
are you sure ?
about what ?
primer cord .
you know that stuff &apos;s highly combustible ?
that &apos;s exactly why we need it .
it &apos;s worth the risk .
i &apos;ll get what you need .
all right , you win .
so what &apos;s the question ?
oh , that &apos;s the trick of it .
i didn &apos;t specify when i was going to ask .
the pink panthers--
the most dangerous gang of thieves in the world .
over the past 20 years , they &apos;ve stolen a total
of $ 1.2 billion worth of diamonds , gems ,
and other valuables .
no law enforcement agency
has ever come close to catching them .
this is alan woodford ...
long suspected to be the leader of the group .
he &apos;s also an owner of an office
at the kessman building .
i think neal plans to infiltrate the gang .
by robbing them ?
intel says that the panthers have an audition process .
that would make for quite an audition .
hell of a way to get yourself killed too .
it &apos;s not without its dangers ,
but neal could have walked away from fat charlie &apos;s .
he didn &apos;t .
can i say what we &apos;re all probably thinking ?
i mean , are we sure neal &apos;s not auditioning
to join the group for real ?
mozzie as much as admitted they were planning to run .
the fbi reneged on a deal with him .
i hate to say it , but he &apos;s pretty motivated to turn against us .
it &apos;s a risk , i know .
but for now , we trust neal .
that &apos;s it .
go home . get some rest .
big day tomorrow .
standard i.d. photo is ready .
i &apos;m watching the roof .
they have a single guard with an electronic checkpoint .
he needs to tap in every five minutes or an alarm sounds .
that gives us a small window .
smile .
why do you want to join the panthers ?
you said it .
they &apos;re the greatest thieves of our time .
but you &apos;ve worked with rebecca before .
that means you &apos;re good .
you don &apos;t need them .
no one in the panthers needs anyone .
that &apos;s the beauty of it .
i looked at each one of them ,
and i knew they were capable of almost anything ,
but if we could all work together ,
you &apos;d get the kind of score you only dream about .
if everyone doesn &apos;t betray each other .
that &apos;s half the fun , isn &apos;t it ?
otherwise , why would i be working with you ?
when you met with him before , was it in woodford &apos;s office ?
yeah . how do you think i know where it is ?
what ?
the exit plan is based on you walking out the front door .
if they see my face , they &apos;ll know i was there .
we can figure out a disguise ,
something to pass the facial scanners .
no , it won &apos;t work .
you &apos;ve never been in the building .
no . that &apos;s not what i signed up for .
you want to get out of town ...
then you need to go in there for me .
no , it &apos;s okay , hon .
i &apos;m so busy with what &apos;s going on ,
i wouldn &apos;t even be able to see you if you were here .
tell me about d.c.
well , there &apos;s not much to tell yet .
i mean , today was all paperwork and orientation ...
oh , and a drug test .
oh , yeah .
well , you know , one look at you ,
and they knew you were trouble .
well , unless pinot noir shows up on my blood test ,
i think i &apos;m gonna pass .
hon , are you sure you don &apos;t want me to come home ?
don &apos;t worry . i &apos;m fine .
satchmo and i are bonding .
my boys . i &apos;m jealous .
i should run , hon .
i &apos;ve got an early @-@ morning meeting .
i love you .
i love you .
don &apos;t shoot .
i &apos;m armed only with comfort food .
mozzie , what the hell are you doing here ?
mrs. suit asked me to make sure you eat something
not made out of green clovers and purple horseshoes .
less magically delicious .
she knows me too well .
next time , just use the front door .
it &apos;s there for a reason .
i &apos;m not eating crickets .
oh , nor should you .
that &apos;s mine .
ah . thank you .
sure .
join me ?
really ?
please .
oh , i have wine .
too bad .
thanks .
likewise .
van &apos;s set up and ready to go .
tac team &apos;s on standby .
all right , i &apos;ll meet you there .
are you worried about him ?
no .
just want to see it with my own eyes .
why does it always have to be heights ?
all right , i see the guard .
he &apos;s going into the building .
i &apos;m in position .
stop screwing around , caffrey .
caffrey , you &apos;re running out of time .
my travel broke .
i &apos;m supposed to meet with the panthers
in two hours , caffrey .
figure something out , now .
guard &apos;s about to come around the bend , caffrey .
now or never .
caffrey , i see the guard .
he kept touching things .
if you don &apos;t want your equipment modified
for maximum accuracy--
we don &apos;t .
boothe was likely acting
as a spotter from the building neal hit with the arrow .
we &apos;re locking it down now .
great . take a team and search every floor
that has a view of the kessman building &apos;s roof .
time to bring in boothe .
i &apos;m on it .
don &apos;t make any deals with him ,
no matter how innocent they sound .
are you sure neal wants you going there ?
i &apos;d say the arrow pointing at it is a pretty big clue .
uh , we may have a different problem now .
woodford .
if he goes into his office , neal &apos;s trapped .
本杰明 · 艾普斯坦
德里克 · 赫夫曼
马修 · 弗里德
i could go in and flash my badge .
all that will do is let him know something &apos;s up .
walking in on neal in his office will do that too .
yeah , what does a guy like that come down to the lobby for ?
something he cares about .
what if we pose as an incoming business
that might be able to lure him down ?
mozzie , you stay--
where did he go ?
what is he up to ?
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m gonna kill him .
what is it ?
i &apos;ll be down right away .
what &apos;s happened ? where is he ?
right there .
is that from my car ?
oh , so you admit you own the car that hit me ?
when ?
just now !
my car is parked .
terribly .
my poor bike ran right into it .
there are laws about how far you can park from the curb
for a reason .
you know what ? i guess we &apos;ll , uh , just call it even .
you &apos;re joking .
that &apos;s thousands of dollars worth of damage .
uh , my bike is totally destroyed .
i can no longer work .
it &apos;s hard to be a bike messenger
without a bike , old chap .
it &apos;s fine .
let &apos;s call it even .
apology accepted , guvna .
looks like it worked .
jones , you get him ?
all right .
boothe was already gone .
he must be rendezvousing with neal .
neal did what boothe wanted .
which means he &apos;s expendable .
did it work ?
in and out with no one the wiser .
now it &apos;s time to get what i want .
i &apos;ll give you the same exit plan
i was gonna give rebecca .
i had a feeling it might go this way .
thank you .
not this again .
because of you , i get to join the pink panthers .
what did you do ?
freeze ! fbi !
stay on the ground !
guy has a gun on you , and you heckle him .
i knew you guys were coming .
it seemed like a good way to buy time .
did you think i ran ?
no .
i figured it was something like this .
really ?
really .
so , the pink panthers .
i may have just auditioned to join them .
here you go .
thank you .
how much do you think they &apos;re worth to the fbi ?
quite a bit .
you really think you can infiltrate them ?
i do , but i have conditions .
i thought you might .
i want a contract .
pink panthers for my freedom .
it has to be ironclad . no wiggle room from the fbi .
i need to know it &apos;s real this time .
you deserve to .
i will make sure that happens .
uh , forgetting something ?
there &apos;s somewhere i need to be first .
mr. woodford ?
boothe is here to see you .
send him in .
well , you &apos;re not the man i was expecting .
no , i &apos;m not .
i &apos;m the man about to take his spot in the pink panthers .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
get him out of here .
check your safe .
this way .
not the dummy one in your desk ,
the real one behind the fake mondrian .
wait .
who told you about it ?
no one . i saw it myself .
there &apos;s no way you &apos;ve been in this room before .
you almost had me , kid .
look , i don &apos;t know what your game is--
look closer .
尼尔 · 卡夫瑞
尼尔 · 卡夫瑞
if i really was who you think i am ,
i could have you killed for this .
you could ...
or you could acknowledge the skill involved ,
skill you need for your team .
i know the pink panthers are looking for one more member ,
and i know boothe failed his audition .
oh , and how do you know that ?
because i &apos;m the reason he failed .
my name is neal caffrey , and i want in .
how &apos;d it go ?
well , i think i passed the first test .
we &apos;ll see if woodford calls .
glad you made it back in time .
we &apos;ve been keeping rebecca in holding ,
and the marshals are about to take her back to prison .
may i ?
yep .
i was wondering if i was going to get to see you .
i &apos;m told i have you to thank for my rescue .
and for getting grabbed in the first place .
call it even ?
i wish i could .
yeah .
i guess my list of sins is a little too long .
why &apos;d you help me ?
people like us--
we live on borrowed time .
we either end up behind bars
or dead .
there &apos;s always another way .
no .
there isn &apos;t .
it catches up to you eventually .
this is as close as we can get to a happy ending , i think ...
being able to do some good before the end .
stand up for me , ma &apos;am .
spend your time well , neal .
before you know it , it &apos;ll be gone .
you okay ?
yeah .
no .
no , i &apos;m not . you know , i ...
i look at her , and i want to see a stranger
who did terrible things , but ...
all i can see is the girl i fell for .
good .
just remember her that way .
after all , that &apos;s who saved you today .
&quot; before the end . &quot;
what &apos;s that ?
she was saying good @-@ bye .
she grabbed his gun . i didn &apos;t have any choice .
hey , hon .
el .
what are you doing here ?
i , uh ...
i just had to come home .
oh , you failed your drug test , didn &apos;t you ?
sort of .
when they took my blood , they found something unexpected .
honey , tell me everything is okay .
more than okay .
i &apos;m pregnant .
you &apos;re pregnant ?
mm @-@ hmm .
we &apos;re pregnant .
yeah .
she made a choice .
for her , it was better to risk almost certain death
than go back to jail .
some birds can &apos;t be caged .
i doubt i &apos;d be that brave if the time came .
is that bravery ?
there &apos;s always another way .
i &apos;ve lived my life on the idea .
that &apos;s what we tell ourselves .
the greatest lies a con man tells are to himself .
but if we are being honest , she &apos;s right .
we &apos;re on borrowed time .
our sins catch up to us all eventually .
maybe not .
i offered peter a deal ...
the pink panthers for my freedom .
while you were kidnapped , i walked in your shoes .
i sat in the fbi ,
felt the camaraderie .
it &apos;s compelling .
it &apos;s also an illusion .
we are who we are ,
as are they .
they promised you freedom before .
what makes you think this time they &apos;ll deliver ?
who says that &apos;s all i &apos;m after ?
