over 68 million americans
leave the safety of our borders every year .
if danger strikes ,
the fbi &apos;s international response team
is called into action .
oh , you guys go ahead . i think i &apos;m going to walk back .
you &apos;re crazy .
you &apos;re like over a mile from your apartment .
are we forgetting my three @-@ mile morning jogs ?
despite what the french think ,
all americans aren &apos;t fat and lazy .
sam , are you sure ? it &apos;s kind of late .
ladies , we &apos;re in paris .
it &apos;s a beautiful night , and you want to squeeze yourself
onto a subway train with a car full of des étrangers ?
somebody has watched &quot; moulin rouge ! &quot; way too many times !
come on ! who &apos;s coming with me ?
sam , i love your bohemian soul and all ,
but my soles are hurting like hell .
no way i &apos;m walking across town in these shoes .
quel dommage .
damn it .
mademoiselle , ça va ?
ça va , merci .
i just completely forgot how to say , &quot; i broke my heel . &quot;
&quot; je cassé mon talon . &quot;
of course , you speak english .
un peu . uh , may i help you , miss ?
no , i &apos;m good .
thank you . merci .
well , you sure i can &apos;t offer you a ride ?
i can take you anywhere you like .
samantha wade .
elementary @-@ school teacher from nashville , tennessee ,
found this morning by two of her friends .
murdered and staged in the apartment she &apos;d been leasing
for the past three weeks .
due to the brutal and provocative nature of samantha wade &apos;s murder ,
our ambassador and the french foreign minister
have requested the i.r.t. &apos; s assistance
in the homicide investigation .
and given that about two million americans visit paris per year ,
not to mention an additional 50,000 on work visas ,
i &apos;d bet they &apos;d also like us
to draw up a threat assessment to u.s. citizens .
well , there &apos;s nothing more threatening than this .
what are these things in her eyes ?
french investigators have identified them as timber scribes .
bladed instruments used by land surveyors to inscribe trees .
not exactly your go @-@ to murder weapon .
especially in an urban environment .
these tools are really old -- pre @-@ world war i.
no prints , so they &apos;re not gonna help us narrow down
our unsub &apos;s current occupation .
yeah , but these scribes
aren &apos;t exactly the murder weapons , either .
i mean , even from these photos ,
you can see that the ocular injuries aren &apos;t her cause of death .
but i don &apos;t see an official autopsy report here , monty .
the autopsy is being performed by the paris coroner
as you guys sail over the atlantic .
it says here that late last night ,
samantha had dinner with the same two friends
who found her this morning -- sheila martin and renee alston .
according to them ,
she chose to walk home while they took the metro train .
yeah , and that was around 12 : 30 a.m. local time .
so samantha could have easily been followed home .
sure .
but there were not signs of forced entry into her apartment .
so it &apos;s possible that she knew or was familiar with her attacker .
except that the french investigators
are interviewing all of her known friends and associates ,
including sheila and renee .
everybody &apos;s alibi is checking out .
which means samantha &apos;s assailant might have presented in a way
that felt comfortable to her .
well , safe enough to open the door .
well , there &apos;s also this french saying ,
se mettre le doigt dans l &apos;oeil ,
which means to put your finger in your eye .
it &apos;s the french equivalent of putting your foot in your mouth .
as in to make a mistake .
a mistake that , obviously ,
someone felt samantha had to pay for .
got to be more to it .
i mean , this staging is so extreme .
it &apos;s like he &apos;s pictured it in his mind &apos;s eye for a while ,
and now he &apos;s bringing it to life .
well , if that &apos;s the case , jack ,
all of this preparation and effort ,
he &apos;s definitely got a taste for it now .
just a sec !
qui est @-@ ce ?
pardon me , mademoiselle .
you left something behind .
no , please !
第一季 第五集
&quot; the bonds between ourselves and another person
exist only in our minds . &quot;
marcel proust .
you must be from the fbi , no ?
yes , we are .
i &apos;m unit chief jack garrett .
these are supervisory special agents
seger , jarvis , and simmons .
and you are ?
commissaire pierre clement ,
lead inspector , police judiciaire .
if you would follow me , please .
i &apos;m not fluent in these joint operations ,
so you must forgive me if i don &apos;t appreciate having ,
how you say , my hand held .
commissaire clement , we are not here to hold your hand ,
just lend our expertise and experience .
bien sûr .
during your flight , another woman was found --
staged in her apartment .
instead of mutilating the eyes , he cut off her head .
took it with him .
another american woman ?
oui .
we have made an identification .
bianca lewis , 37 years old ,
work visa says she was employed as a publicist .
living in paris for about 18 months .
is there any connection
between bianca lewis and samantha wade ?
none that my inspectors have been able to establish thus far .
we &apos;ll follow up with victimology back home .
but right now , all we know is samantha was a tourist
and bianca was a temporary non @-@ immigrant worker .
still , female american
- both staying in the 18th arrondissement .
montmartre --
part of the right bank in the northern section of city .
hey , guys , take a look at this .
somebody has been seriously over @-@ sharing with the press .
well , that would be me , mademoiselle .
in my experience , sharing with our journalists
often has a way of ... shaking the fruit out of the tree .
and smacking you on the head , right ?
let &apos;s just say that your faith in the press corps
is a little stronger than ours .
so , i &apos;ve arranged for you to work out of this room .
and copies of all our reports
will be made available as soon as we --
actually , i &apos;ll need to visit the bianca lewis crime scene
with agent simmons here .
i &apos;ll also need agent jarvis to review the autopsy findings
while agent seger looks over the evidence
collected at the samantha wade scene .
anything else you require , sir ?
no , that &apos;s it .
for now .
très bien .
let &apos;s get to work .
just like at samantha &apos;s apartment .
bianca &apos;s body was posed
in the same area of the room as samantha &apos;s ,
the same sitting position ...
with all the violence concentrated right here .
everything else looks pretty undisturbed .
like bianca had just come home from grocery shopping .
these bags are pretty full , though .
maybe somebody helped her carry them up the stairs .
what are you thinking , jack ?
no arterial spray .
he killed her before he removed her head .
postmortem mutilation .
it &apos;s like what mae said about samantha &apos;s eyes .
you think he took the head as a trophy ?
it &apos;s hard to say .
maybe he thought in this case ,
having a severed head lying around
would just confuse his message .
well , i &apos;m confused .
we have one woman with gouged eyes ,
another with no head .
what the hell &apos;s he trying to say ,
besides , &quot; i &apos;m a sick , misogynistic son of a bitch &quot; ?
the staging at both scenes was deliberate , complicated .
it would have taken a lot of time .
and yet our unsub had no fear of
interruption or distraction .
because you think that he knew
they were staying in these apartments alone .
which would suggest that
even if samantha and bianca didn &apos;t know each other ,
they might have known the unsub .
except he &apos;s completely objectified his victims .
it &apos;s a lot harder to objectify someone
you &apos;ve had a relationship with ...
rather than a stranger .
so how do you get to know someone
without really knowing them ?
all righty .
three years of college french , don &apos;t fail me now .
okay .
&quot; the sharp @-@ force injury to each eye occurred ... &quot;
&quot; postmortem . &quot; good call , jarvis .
&quot; with samantha &apos;s cause de décès
actually being étranglement . &quot;
strangulation , broken hyoid bone .
while bianca &apos;s cause of death is ...
also étranglement , wow .
okay , &quot; avant la mort ... &quot;
&quot; antemortem contusions suggest manual strangulation
prior to the crude disarticulation of the head . &quot;
hold on .
&quot; also recovered a fragment of metal ,
possibly a piece of l &apos;arme du crime . &quot;
the murder weapon .
oh , way to bury the lead , guys .
weird .
quoi de neuf , mon cher ami ?
hey , i need you to run some evidence for me .
okay , but you do know that the french
pretty much invented forensic science , right ?
yeah . give or take a hundred years .
i &apos;m just saying that they &apos;ve got a pretty good crime lab
right there in paris .
so the coroner was able to recover
a piece of the murder weapon from bianca &apos;s body ,
and i know that they &apos;re gonna mass @-@ spec
the you @-@ know @-@ what out of it .
but there is this weird piece of this symbol on it .
these curvy , wavy lines look like i got some work to do .
so samantha had dinner with her friends
here in the 10th arrondissement .
and then she walked back
to her apartment here in the 18th .
we have yet to determine the precise route ,
so a broad search of cctv footage
has turned up nothing yet .
however ...
it would appear she arrived home ,
and then some time later ,
she invited the intruder inside the premises .
that &apos;s a very long way to walk in those heels .
that &apos;s what her friends thought , too .
one of the heels is broken .
snapped off in the struggle with her assailant , to be sure .
are you sure ?
did you see this residue ?
i did not personally process the victim &apos;s clothes , no .
but i &apos;m not sure how gravel would be probative .
it &apos;s not gravel .
do you see how it sort of shimmers in the light ?
this is epoxy mortar .
it &apos;s used to set , among other things , cobblestones --
like the ones in some of your famous little streets around here .
agent seger , those cobblestone streets
are hundreds of years old .
exactly . that &apos;s why people travel
all over the world to walk on them .
the dirty little secret is some of those stones
are not nearly as old as advertised .
bien sûr , they require maintenance .
and some of them even need to be replaced .
that &apos;s where the epoxy mortar comes in .
48 hours ago , samantha took a walk
on a freshly paved cobblestone street ,
somewhere between the restaurant and her apartment .
that &apos;s when she broke her heel .
and she walked home from there .
but she didn &apos;t .
look at the autopsy photos of her feet .
there &apos;s no scratches , no dirt --
nothing to suggest that she walked barefoot anywhere .
she got a ride back to her apartment .
i suppose she could have hailed a taxi .
exactly .
from a street that had had recent road work done .
and if we &apos;re lucky , some sort of surveillance camera .
putting mae &apos;s metal fragment aside ,
i found the street that you &apos;re looking for , clara --
right , but commissaire clement said
that there were no cctv cameras nearby .
he is correct .
however , there &apos;s an american bank
on a nearby corner with a camera that captured this .
they were kind enough to send me the security @-@ camera footage .
that &apos;s not a taxi .
is that the best image we have of the driver ?
i am afraid so .
oh , it doesn &apos;t look like she knows this guy .
yeah , it &apos;s so weird .
i mean , not only does she get into a car with a stranger ,
but she gets into the backseat .
there &apos;s no record of samantha requesting a ride @-@ share .
what if it was a gypsy cab ?
gypsy cab in paris ?
hold on .
wait . what &apos;s that right there --
hanging from the rearview mirror ?
it looks like a hackney horse .
which is a recent symbol for gypsy cabs in the city .
and that &apos;s how you get to know someone without knowing them .
our unsub drives a gypsy cab .
makes perfect sense -- he needs a way to learn
if his prospective victims are american , living alone .
this way , he gets to interview them .
it &apos;s kind of like &quot; taxicab confessions . &quot;
i mean , taxi @-@ cab drivers and bartenders --
they &apos;re always the strangers
that we feel the most comfortable confiding in .
because they are shared intimacies
we want to believe are fleeting
and don &apos;t have a lasting impact .
at least we have the image of the vehicle .
this partial license @-@ plate number won &apos;t get us very far .
it won &apos;t get us anywhere .
those plates are stolen .
and i got to be honest , it &apos;s not gonna be that easy
tracking down this one particular vehicle .
there &apos;s at least 25,000 of them registered in paris alone .
well , we can start by having the local police
sweep the 18th arrondissement .
well , that &apos;s a start , but our unsub &apos;s hunting ground
is gonna expand wherever he can find a vulnerable american woman .
and with 2 victims in less than 48 hours ,
he &apos;s already hunting for his next victim right now .
hey , hey . bonjour .
uh , je veux que vous me chassez ...
sorry . pardon .
um , peux tu --
oh , it &apos;s all right , mademoiselle . i do speak english .
oh ! seriously ?
that &apos;s awesome .
i can take you anywhere you like .
how about 17 rue de foss ?
where are you from , then ?
san diego , california .
and what brings you to paris ?
a music internship -- i play piano .
in the cafe where you work , i presume ?
no , i just need some extra cash .
and it &apos;s helping me improve my french .
so , uh , 17 rue de foss .
that is not a hostel or hotel .
no , yeah , i &apos;m staying with a friend .
ah . a boyfriend ?
i wish .
you must have a special boyfriend ,
a beautiful butterfly like you .
oh , not so much .
and , uh ...
how are you getting along with this friend you &apos;re staying with ?
you know what ?
um , do you mind just letting me out up at the corner up here ?
but we &apos;re not at your apartment .
no , i know , that &apos;s okay . just right up here .
no , it &apos;s not . it &apos;s not safe here .
okay , look , françois , i want out now !
you let me out right now , or i &apos;m sending this to the cops .
do you hear me ?
what the hell are you doing ? !
katherine barker , 25 .
a music intern from san diego , california .
she was discovered in an alley in the 2nd arrondissement .
he literally tore out her heart and stuck it in her hands .
looks like she suffered compound fractures to her legs
and her pelvis .
and that tells me that he tore her heart out
after he ran her over .
but why change the pattern here ?
why stage the body in an alley , not her own apartment ?
because katherine fought back .
she tried to get away .
these abrasions on her face , along her legs --
it &apos;s road rash ,
i &apos;d say from jumping out of a moving vehicle .
so now we &apos;re looking at 3 victims
in the span of 72 hours .
and given that our unsub
needs to find an american woman in a foreign city ,
it &apos;s as if he doesn &apos;t have a cooling @-@ off period .
i think it &apos;s time we speak to the public about what we know .
offer them a warning
to avoid contact with the driver of this gypsy cab ,
implore them to notify us immediately if they should see him .
that strategy cuts both ways .
&quot; cuts both ways &quot; -- what do you mean ?
no doubt a warning will protect the public in the near term .
what we &apos;re concerned with is if we &apos;re not able
to apprehend the unsub immediately afterwards ,
then he might respond by abandoning the car .
and right now , as long as he feels comfortable
behind that wheel , then we have a chance of catching him .
but if he ditches that car ,
not only will it make it harder for us to track him down ,
it will force him - to alter his m.o. even further .
so you &apos;re telling me i &apos;m damned if i do , damned if i don &apos;t .
we need more time .
letting the unsub know what we know right now
is really a nuclear option .
i will wait then -- until morning .
then we sound the alarms .
so what did i tell you , mae ?
the french ran a radiocarbon dating on the metal fragment
that was recovered from bianca lewis &apos; body .
turns out to be an iron composite
that was smelted down into what is essentially a hand saw --
some time in the late 19th century .
well , i &apos;m gonna go out on a limb and say
this probably won &apos;t help us narrow down our unsub &apos;s identity .
maybe , but it did help me identify
those weird wavy lines etched into the fragment .
now , because the timber scribes and the hand saw
are both very old and very french ,
i did some digging and discovered a logo
for a once @-@ renowned wood @-@ craftsman company out of marseilles .
le lion de l &apos;eau .
company was founded by the boulanger family in 1880 .
it remained family @-@ owned until it was sold in 1987 .
and whatever happened after that to either the company
or the boulanger family was not uploaded for digital posterity .
so what are we thinking ?
if our unsub &apos;s weapons of choice
can be loosely traced back to this company ,
then is he a possible relative of the boulanger family ?
or a subsidiary that acquired some of the company &apos;s assets .
your guess is as good as mine .
we don &apos;t have time for guesswork .
we need to be able to provide clement and his people
with a workable profile ,
otherwise he &apos;s gonna release the information we have
to the public .
so let &apos;s go over it again .
okay , we &apos;re looking for someone who is criminally sophisticated ,
strong , patient , which suggests to me an older male ,
probably in his 40s .
hunting for the right victim takes time ,
so it doesn &apos;t look like he has a job .
unless the gypsy @-@ cab thing is legit
and he &apos;s only striking when the victim is the right type .
yeah , and based on his staging of the bodies
at the last crime scene ,
it appears to me that katherine , bianca , and samantha
are all surrogates for our unsub &apos;s true target ,
and their murders are probably a means
to build his courage and confidence
in order to commit the ultimate act .
so somewhere out there is an american woman
who broke this guy &apos;s heart .
or rejected him or - committed some perceived slight
that he now feels that he has to redress --
in the most brutal way possible .
jack ?
clement is dropping the bomb .
you were right .
he abandoned his vehicle in entrepôt ...
the 10th arrondissement .
he left nothing behind for us .
i know you believe
i have altered this monster &apos;s behavior unpredictably .
but i would like to believe i stalled his progress .
he will most certainly need another car
in order to maintain his deceit .
if he maintains his deceit .
he could just go into a tailspin --
you need to double down .
call in reinforcements if you have to .
your department needs to show overwhelming force
on the streets of paris tonight
and every night until we catch this man .
this unsub needs to feel your breath
on the back of his neck at all times ,
and every american woman out there who could be his next victim
needs to feel like there &apos;s a cop on every corner
who &apos;s there to protect them .
i will do what i can .
all right , we need to focus on a possible connection
between our unsub and the boulanger family
or this craftsman company in marseilles .
and we need to find some way to get our hands on hard copies
of all those records and histories .
all right , i &apos;m on it .
mademoiselle , do you speak english ?
english ?
yes .
are you american , by chance ?
her name is alexandra lafayette .
her husband came home last night and startled an intruder ,
who escaped .
but that &apos;s when he found her .
she &apos;s french ?
my inspectors - didn &apos;t immediately connect her
with the american women until they saw this .
looks like a butterfly .
i don &apos;t understand .
he filled her stomach full of dead butterflies .
yeah , but it doesn &apos;t look like any kind of butterfly
i &apos;ve ever seen before .
he didn &apos;t take the time to stage her body at the scene .
as i said , madame lafayette &apos;s husband walked in on him .
yeah , but how did he not
know that she was living with her husband ?
i mean , do you think that he didn &apos;t have a chance to ask her ?
or maybe he no longer cares .
why wouldn &apos;t he care ?
it &apos;s a terrible risk .
because maybe he doesn &apos;t have time to care
if his victims are american or french .
and now any vulnerable woman will do .
he has to finish what he started before it &apos;s too late .
too late for what , mademoiselle ?
well , for one thing , he knows that we &apos;re on to him .
and it &apos;s just a matter of time before we shut him down , right ?
right , but i think there &apos;s
something else applying pressure to him ,
forcing him to accelerate his mission ,
it &apos;s statement .
and this time , it &apos;s his butterflies in the stomach .
that is what he was trying to say .
i think we &apos;ve been looking at these murders
like they &apos;re just rehearsals .
but maybe they &apos;re the main event .
how do you figure ?
i think our visceral reaction to the brutality here
is keeping us from seeing the scene
from the unsub &apos;s point of view .
i have butterflies in my stomach .
i have my heart in my hands .
i lost my head .
and i am blinded by love .
this is not love .
this is vicious and cruel .
yes , but , you see ,
they aren &apos;t either of those things to our unsub .
to him , these crime scenes are a way
for him to try and express himself .
yeah , and you think that he &apos;s trying to express himself
to this idealized american woman ?
i do .
i think he is trying to tell her how she makes him feel .
it &apos;s like a series of sick , twisted valentines &apos; .
so you don &apos;t think she &apos;s a target .
i think she &apos;s the object of his affections ,
and he will try and reach out to her for sure .
but if and when she rejects his affections ...
he will feel betrayed by love
and ultimately lash out on her .
let us presume you &apos;re correct , agent seger .
if we can &apos;t find this man ,
perhaps we find this woman .
i just don &apos;t know if she will be any easier to find than him .
yeah , but let &apos;s not forget about these guys here .
i mean ...
something tells me that this butterfly effect may just --
how did you say it , commissaire clement ?
shake the fruit out of the tree ?
say hello to my little friend .
udaspes folus -- a.k.a. the grass demon butterfly .
not only does he not normally reside in your intestines ,
but he &apos;s a non @-@ native to the european continent .
he prefers india and southeast asia .
so our unsub either gets hold of these demon butterflies
by importing them or stealing them .
let &apos;s go with what &apos;s behind door number two .
import records show a delivery was made to the paris area
about nine months ago , to maison des papillons ,
which is literally &quot; house o &apos; butterflies . &quot;
then about a week ago , a trespassing charge was filed
and then dropped
against a 42 @-@ year @-@ old man named paul mossier .
wait a second . that name sounds familiar .
that last name -- mossier .
when i followed up with the boulanger family
and what &apos;s become - of the le lion de l &apos;eau company ,
there was a dispute over inheritance
that was filed 20 years ago by killian mossier .
could be an uncle - on madame boulanger &apos;s side .
i &apos;m not big on coincidence .
yeah , right .
and if paul is connected to the family ,
then that &apos;s how he gets the murder weapons .
monty , what else can you tell us
about this paul mossier ?
he &apos;s got a bit of a record
dating back the last several years .
various assaults , disorderly conduct .
then it says here that following
an attempted assault on a police officer ,
paul mossier was remanded to a psychiatric hospital .
he &apos;s supposed to be an in @-@ patient
at l &apos;institut du pinel .
clara and i will check it out ...
while you two stay here and try to identify
the american woman who &apos;s the focus of our unsub &apos;s attention .
bonjour .
bonjour .
je suis l &apos;officier seger .
c &apos;est l &apos;unité du chef garrett .
nous sommes du fbi .
nous aimerions parler avec monsieur paul mossier .
excuse me .
you are looking for paul ?
that &apos;s right . and you are ?
dr. alain gilles ,
clinical director of behavioral health .
is paul mossier a patient here ?
i &apos;m sorry , but , uh , why does the fbi want to speak to him ?
his name &apos;s come up with regards to an ongoing investigation .
you think he has something to do
with the american women who have been murdered .
we need to speak to him .
paul was released from our supervision
over two weeks ago .
when he was remanded to this facility ,
what was his diagnosis ?
i &apos;m truly not at liberty to share those details with you .
were you his primary therapist ?
yes , myself and dr. bernard .
but to be honest ,
paul showed the greatest signs of improvement
over the last months
while working with one of our volunteers .
she , uh , used art therapy .
is this her ?
yes . her name is amy wallace .
amy &apos;s an american , isn &apos;t she ?
yes , she is .
may we speak with her ?
unfortunately , she is no longer here .
she left about a month ago .
did she see this before she left ?
no .
paul took her absence very hard .
he comes from a family of craftsmen ,
but due to his struggles with mental health ,
they rejected him .
amy was probably the first person
to help him realize his potential .
but this hospital felt comfortable releasing him
despite his known aggressive tendencies
and this suggestion of a violent fantasy ?
it &apos;s not - what i would have preferred ,
but paul had improved enough
that we could no longer hold him involuntarily .
do you know if paul tried to contact amy after his release ?
as a matter of fact , he did , yes .
he asked for her address .
and that &apos;s when someone mentioned that she had gotten engaged
and that she was returning to the united states .
but you don &apos;t know if or when she returned to the u.s. ?
no , i do not , i &apos;m sorry .
thank you , doctor .
sure .
thank you .
we need to find amy wallace -- now .
paul ?
bonjour , amy .
i didn &apos;t know you knew where i lived .
well , i apologize for not calling
before dropping by like this .
no , it &apos;s fine . i ...
just thought you were the movers .
they &apos;re already an hour late ,
and i &apos;m moving back home .
but it &apos;s really good to see you .
it &apos;s really good to see you , too .
sorry i haven &apos;t had a chance to visit .
it &apos;s been a busy time .
well ...
i &apos;m no longer a patient at the hospital .
wonderful .
and you &apos;re still working on the things we were focused on ?
oh , yes , i have .
i @-@ i need to show you something .
okay .
uh , but , uh , it &apos;s not here .
so i need to take you -- to see it .
paul , like i said , i can &apos;t leave .
i &apos;m still waiting for the movers .
i ...
i &apos;ve been working really hard , amy .
please ...
come ...
with me .
okay .
let me just grab my coat .
okay .
paul , stop , stop !
please .
i &apos;m not going to hurt you .
i promise .
we &apos;re just playing le jeu d &apos;évanouissement
it &apos;s a fainting game .
good night , my love .
my inspectors have searched the building and outer perimeter .
there &apos;s no sign of paul mossier or amy wallace .
no sign of a struggle .
i &apos;m not surprised .
if we &apos;re right , at this moment ,
paul &apos;s intention is not to hurt amy ,
but to try and impress her with what he &apos;s done .
so he would have incapacitated her
in order to transport her someplace
he feels safe and comfortable .
i cannot believe his intention is not to kill her .
she could already be dead
and he &apos;s taken her body somewhere to pose it .
believe it or not , paul &apos;s actually trying to woo amy ,
which means we have time , but you are right .
eventually , amy will see what paul has done ,
and she will absolutely reject him .
and that &apos;s when he kills her .
the question is , where did he take her ?
simmons , what do you got ?
2 : 37 p.m. ,
alexandra lafayette called for roadside assistance .
when the tow @-@ truck driver finally showed up ,
he sees another tow truck hauling away
appears to be alexandra &apos;s vehicle .
that was under the bridge near the rue de l &apos;etoile ,
and monty &apos;s got a hook up to the cctv cameras
at the intersection running both north and south of there .
let me patch you in , boss .
i was able to spot our unsub &apos;s new ride , which is a tow truck ,
and he &apos;s clearly got alexandra &apos;s car hooked up to it .
he &apos;s heading northbound on the rue d &apos;etoile .
but i ran all the cctv footage .
i lost them heading north @-@ northeast
toward the tremblay @-@ en @-@ france .
i don &apos;t think he &apos;d take her completely out of the city , jack .
that &apos;s a pretty industrial area . it &apos;s a good place to lay low .
but there &apos;s no record of a paul mossier
owning or leasing property out in that area .
well , it &apos;s got to be connected
to killian mossier somehow .
mae and i will check the records again .
we need to set up a command post out near the airport .
paul ? where am i ?
no !
that &apos;s why i need you to see everything i &apos;ve done , okay ?
here . here .
according to those files you scanned for me ,
the mossier clan is like some withering bastard branch
of the boulanger family tree .
but the mossiers -- or what &apos;s left of them --
they held title to five separate holdings
on the outskirts of paris .
from meaux all the way to plaisir .
jack and clara are getting pretty close
to that one property in villepinte .
we have lost our sense of history .
they are calling me the butcher of paris .
that name was given to marcel petiot .
he was a doctor who killed 23 people
during world war ii .
he was a butcher .
and moi ?
i am ... an artiste .
i took flesh and bone and made them , uh ...
transcendent .
but none of this would be possible without you .
you are my muse , amy .
because of you , i am transcendent .
you &apos;ve always been special , paul .
but i couldn &apos;t see that before you .
i know .
you know ...
when i was a little boy ,
my father tried to teach me how to carve the wood .
he got frustrated
and burned my hand with his cigarette .
told me i was not his blood .
i ... i am so sorry .
will you please let me go , paul ?
i can &apos;t .
yes , you can .
no , no , amy .
without you , i am nothing .
i love you , amy .
je t &apos;aime .
you understand what i &apos;ve done , don &apos;t you ?
i do .
how do you like it ?
jack , the french national police
have detained killian mossier in toulouse .
he has confirmed that his nephew has taken possession
of the property you &apos;re heading to now .
does he know if his nephew
has stockpiled any other weapons ?
he knows that his nephew &apos;s crazy .
i ...
i can &apos;t believe you did that .
all those women , paul ?
oh . je suis désolé .
oh , sorry ?
you &apos;re disgusting .
you &apos;re sick .
you &apos;ve always been sick .
tu est ...
une salope ...
... sans coeur !
i &apos;m sorry , amy .
put it down , paul !
now !
you know what ?
this is one time - that i am kind of okay with
the mechanical delay on the jet .
this is a beautiful city .
yes , it is .
it &apos;s hard sometimes to appreciate the beauty .
yeah , - we got to find it -- somehow .
otherwise , i don &apos;t think we could do the job we need to do .
yeah , even the darkest night will end , and the sun will rise .
to beauty --
wherever we may find it .
