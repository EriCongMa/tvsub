yes , i promise i &apos;ll call you as soon as i get the results .
yes , i am aware that hospitals are a hotbed of infection .
thank you , manny .
a couple of weeks ago , i had a minor heart incident .
i am fine .
but just to be safe , i &apos;m having an angiogram ,
which is when they inject a dye
to make sure there &apos;s no blockage .
it &apos;s--it &apos;s no big deal .
we &apos;re not worried .
no .
if something were to happen , which it &apos;s not ...
not gonna .
i would turn our bedroom into a shrine to claire .
and this room into a hall of magic .
luke , please stop taking appliances apart .
i &apos;m making something .
you &apos;re unmaking something .
&apos;cause i &apos;m giving my notice today .
wait . what ?
but wouldn &apos;t we rather have toast that &apos;s already buttered ?
i love that you &apos;re asking these kind of questions .
if only the springs were stronger ,
the toast would be catapulted into the pool of butter .
really strong springs ,
like the ones in your mattress ?
you &apos;re unbelievable .
what do you mean you &apos;re quitting ?
your manager just started letting you
open and close the store .
it &apos;s boring .
and jennifer said that i could get a job at the jewelry store .
honey , you need to learn to stick with things .
you just got the big keys .
where &apos;s the coffeepot ?
oh , you mean the soon @-@ to @-@ be coffee bot ?
luke !
i need caffeine today .
you can have juice .
how late were you at that party last night ?
oh , please . she snuck in at 10 : 00
and spent all night reading under the covers with a flashlight .
alex , what have i told you
about staying out past your curfew ?
i need to do it more often .
exactly .
you need to learn to have some fun .
you are going on that spring break trip with nicole .
no ! no , i can &apos;t .
i have to study for the p.s.a.t.s.
luke ! phil , talk to your children .
all right . everybody listen up .
haley , you &apos;re not quitting .
you &apos;re resigning . it sounds better .
no .
alex , you have all of spring break
to lock yourself in your room and study .
no , no , no , no , no .
and , luke , coffee bot is a non @-@ starter .
but i do like the idea
of popcorn kernels in the pancake batter ...
so they self @-@ flip .
stop talking !
step away from the children .
manny ?
i am telling you how handsome you are .
oh . well , next time , tell me in english
so i don &apos;t miss it .
you &apos;re forgetting all your spanish . you never practice .
perdoname , mami , soy embarazada .
you just told me that you &apos;re pregnant .
congratulations . you &apos;re glowing .
really ? that &apos;s what you &apos;re wearing ?
really ? that &apos;s how you talk to your meal ticket ?
besides , those snobs don &apos;t care what i wear ,
as long as i bring my checkbook .
today i have an interview with the dryden academy .
it &apos;s only the most prestigious prep school around .
their school song has 36 verses ,
and i know all of &apos; em .
settle in .
and the reason you &apos;re not bringing him ?
he says that i make him nervous ,
that i care too much .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m not even allowed to bring him to his haircuts anymore .
i never went to private school .
hell , i never even finished college ,
and look at me . that danish i just ate cost 6 bucks .
i didn &apos;t even blink .
i &apos;ve always felt out of place in public school ,
like a lone petunia in an onion patch .
you felt out of place ?
let me tell you something about your prep school buddies .
when i was younger , i had a job
checking coats at a country club .
these smug rich kids used to waltz in there
and throw their coats at me like i was nothing .
that was before your high @-@ tech fabrics .
they weighed a ton .
you see that scar ?
the one you got in the war ?
that &apos;s what i tell people .
i caught the scalloped edge of a burberry duffel coat toggle .
still not sure there isn &apos;t a piece in there .
kids will always want to quit
when things get hard if you let &apos; em .
this is a girl who was kicked out of college .
the least she can do is stick it out at a little--
phil ?
sorry .
look , all we can do is give haley the time
to find out who she is .
or we could save that time ,
and i could tell her who she is .
let me know how that works out .
excuse me ?
oh , sorry , but my tv doesn &apos;t work ,
and you &apos;re all i &apos;ve got .
i &apos;m norman .
good to meet you , norman .
what are you in for ?
triple bypass .
awesome .
and it sounded like you were agreeing with my parenting style ,
so , please , continue .
well , i &apos;ve raised three kids ,
and the main thing i learned is
you have to let them be who they are .
thank you , norman .
just because he &apos;s behind a curtain doesn &apos;t make him a wizard .
dad , i made you this necklace .
it &apos;s good for healing .
there &apos;s no scientific evidence to back that up , dad .
i married a doctor .
i have three degrees .
girls , where &apos;s your little brother ?
he didn &apos;t get his arm stuck in a vending machine again , did he ?
are you getting this ?
yes . they sound just like our kids ,
and they all got together to visit their dad ...
who apparently did a pretty good job raising them .
please . he sounds like an old hippie .
a wise , insightful , old hippie .
a jeff bridges hippie .
hey , dad .
there he is !
look at that sharp suit .
oh , my god , luke gets huge .
you &apos;ve seen this .
i wore it to angela &apos;s wedding .
yeah . it &apos;s just like the one i had made for my little jonathan .
okay , mrs. dunphy .
time for your prep .
okay .
see what happens when parents get out of the way ?
weddings , babies , sharp suits .
you might want to wheel her by the burn unit .
she just got scorched .
wait . you made a suit for jonathan ?
he &apos;s a cat .
he &apos;s a hairless stray . he needs the suit for warmth .
you know , that thing .
all of your husbands eventually stop feeling for you .
i did not come here to be insulted .
i came here for dad .
dad , i need $ 500 .
how can you need money ? you have four divorce settlements .
yeah , sorry i &apos;m not some sad , lonely exorcist .
archivist . i &apos;m an archivist .
ugh . this arguing .
i might as well have just stayed in court .
please be a lawyer . please be a lawyer .
how &apos;d it go ?
i got probation plus time served .
suck it !
well , maybe now you &apos;ll stop
siphoning electricity off the grid with a meat hook .
hey , look at me for a second .
when you die alone in your bed ,
jonathan &apos;s going to eat you .
yep .
lily ! time for girls &apos; day !
we &apos;ve always tried to make sure that
lily has a feminine influence in her life .
because i &apos;m sure it is so difficult for her
to be around so much masculine energy all the time .
yeah , and recently , uh ,
she &apos;s been asking a lot of questions about the female body .
and ...
uh , we are not exactly experts ,
so we d--just sit on &apos; em .
we decided to call in the big guns .
hola .
hi , gloria !
lily is so excited for girls &apos; day .
yeah , but don &apos;t keep her all afternoon .
you know how we miss her . mm @-@ hmm .
okay .
when am i going to get real boobs ?
okay , so we &apos;ll see you whenever .
absolutely . you know , just have a really great time .
vamos , mami , vamos .
so we &apos;ll do a little shopping ,
we can have our pretty nails done ...
and our pretty hair .
do you think that &apos;s fun ?
yeah !
and you know what the best part of having a girls &apos; day is ?
that you can ask me anything you want .
did you know i &apos;m gay ?
this is lucky .
at 2 : 00 , the school &apos;s award @-@ winning bell players
will be performing a medley of civil war drinking songs .
what do they call that ? unhappy hour ?
interesting .
this was an all @-@ boys academy when it was established in 1901 .
thank god they went away from that tradition , huh ?
yeah . i bet the place is one giant orgy now .
jay , please .
hey , do you want to grab a coat ?
grab your own coat , college boy .
uh , i meant for you .
they want us all to wear a school blazer for the tour ,
get the whole dryden experience .
right . i @-@ i &apos;m sorry , buddy .
hello , parents , perspective norsemen . welcome .
our tour will begin this direction
with a view of our renowned equestrian center .
it took me right back to 40 years ago--
candy @-@ ass preppies with too many privileges .
you know what i hated most about those guys ?
they all had these little noses .
what is that ?
to your left , the world @-@ class campbell observatory .
now , of course , if it &apos;s stars of the hollywood kind that you like ,
our award @-@ winning theater is just here ,
where this june
ms. nicole kidman will be appearing in &quot; picnic . &quot;
okay , gun to my head ,
maybe i was a tiny bit jealous of those guys back then ,
with their cars and their fancy hair products--
your brylcreems and your vo5s .
we &apos;ll now take a short break , where you &apos;re free to explore
the treasures of our rare book library .
you know what was a rare book in my school library ?
one that didn &apos;t have genitals drawn all over it .
who am i kidding ?
i wanted what those kids had then ,
and 40 years later , i still wanted it .
manny , write down what they said about the library .
they &apos;re liable to ask you about that in the interview .
and get the lead out . we don &apos;t want to miss the bell players .
excuse me !
but she &apos;s so young .
do you really think that she already--
i knew when i was 5 .
everybody knew when you were 5 .
not true .
not everyone knew until
i threw myself my second 5th birthday party .
come on , lily is not gay .
it &apos;s probably just a phase .
oh , my god . did i just say that ?
do not tell anyone i just said that .
i got my sweater . can i go now ?
here . yeah , sweetie . have a seat .
oh . imagine if this was a hay bale ,
and she was wearing a prairie skirt .
it would be a total flashback .
stay with us .
um , so gloria was telling us about something that you said .
something about you being gay ?
what about it ?
okay , very aggressive . just saying .
um , w @-@ we &apos;re--we &apos;re just wondering , you know ,
why did you say that ?
because i &apos;m gay .
but why do you think you &apos;re gay , sweetie ?
we &apos;re learning about it in school .
my friend aldo &apos;s parents are italian ,
so he &apos;s italian .
and you and daddy are gay , so i &apos;m gay .
first of all , adorable .
but that &apos;s not how it works .
when aldo &apos;s talking about him being italian ,
he &apos;s talking about his heritage .
yeah , and that &apos;s a totally different thing than being gay .
see , heritage is , uh ...
well , it &apos;s something that you &apos;re born with ,
and--oh , my god . what &apos;s wrong with me ?
and with respect to your heritage , you &apos;re not gay .
you &apos;re vietnamese .
what &apos;s that ?
well , vietnam is a beautiful country ,
and it &apos;s near china .
uh , it--it &apos;s known for , uh ...
its--its farms , with all of the , uh ...
uh , water buffalos .
water buffalo .
and ... bikes . lily , there are bikes everywhere .
there are so many bikes .
so many bikes .
people are biking around . and , uh ...
and then--and they &apos;re wearing hats .
hats . they have these beautiful sun hats .
that swoop .
can i go and play now ?
please . go . yes . yes , gosh . would ya ?
love for you to .
is that all you know about her culture ?
no . i mean , w @-@ we &apos;re-- we &apos;re saving
some of the things until she gets older to tell her about .
i @-@ i wanna say the windmills and the tulips ?
don &apos;t .
no wonder she has so many questions .
she doesn &apos;t know who she is .
well , i guess we kind of dropped the ball .
you know what ? forget the pretty nails .
we are all going to a vietnamese restaurant ,
and we are gonna give her a taste of her culture .
which one is the best restaurant around here ?
i wanna say saigon .
there &apos;s little , um ...
you know nothing .
i &apos;ll look in the jelp .
thank you .
you &apos;re welcome .
hey , we should go . mom &apos;s gonna be here soon .
why don &apos;t you stay and say hello ?
she &apos;d love to see you .
why ? so she can tell me how to live my life ?
yeah , i &apos;ve got my probation officer for that .
we &apos;ll see her on her birthday . when &apos;s the next important one ?
i know it &apos;s none of my business , but ...
is &apos;t possible that your mom doesn &apos;t want you to make certain mistakes
&apos;cause she cares ?
oh , my god . you sound just like her .
let &apos;s roll .
haley , you are not quitting your job .
where is this coming from ?
it &apos;s coming from the future-- your future--
and it ain &apos;t pretty .
i don &apos;t understand . in the future , i &apos;m not pretty ?
no , you &apos;ll hold up okay . but this path you &apos;re on ,
flitting from one thing to the next ,
it ends in a pile of ex @-@ husbands and nicotine fingers .
can i talk now , dad ?
no !
hello ?
alex ? you don &apos;t have to go on that trip with nicole .
you can study as much as you want .
just know that i love you .
okay .
listen to me , haley . you are dangerously close
to getting on a path you can &apos;t get off of .
dad , stop yelling .
mom , stop crying . i know i &apos;m not a big nerd .
here , mom wants to talk to you .
dad wants to talk to you .
hello ?
hello ?
alex , book down ,
run a brush through your hair .
you &apos;re going on that trip with your friend .
what ?
haley , i love you .
if you don &apos;t want to work in that store ,
i &apos;ll help you find something you like better .
is this reverse psychiatry ?
no , honey . actually , nothing is .
i just want you to be happy .
mom , you &apos;re freaking me out .
why is everyone screaming ?
here !
here !
this is luke .
why are mom and dad acting so cracy ?
i don &apos;t know , but it &apos;s creepy .
something &apos;s going on .
do you think it has to do with mom &apos;s heart thing ?
like it &apos;s more serious than they &apos;re saying ?
we have to go to the hospital .
oh , my god ! oh , my god !
okay , everybody , calm down .
here &apos;s what we know .
mom had to go to the hospital for a simple procedure .
then mom and dad start calling us , acting weird .
open your eyes , people .
they &apos;ve been kidnapped .
well , now that the tour &apos;s over , we can probably take these off .
i don &apos;t see the rush .
and you gotta be mentally sharp for your interview .
how you feeling ?
pretty good .
you know , parents are allowed to sit in ,
but if you don &apos;t feel like it ...
are you kidding me ? i wouldn &apos;t miss it .
this is where it all starts .
sure seems like you &apos;ve come around on this place , jay .
how could i not ? this place is unbelievable .
i &apos;m already picturing those jerks at the club
seeing my son walk in wearing a dryden jacket .
manny delgado ?
i @-@ i guess what i &apos;m trying to say is ,
i like books for reading them .
you care to elaborate ?
indeed .
did you ever see one of those slow @-@ motion movies
where they destroy an old casino ,
and it just implodes ?
that .
so who are your favorite authors ?
that &apos;s a long list .
i &apos;d probably have to start with ...
go ahead . hard as you can .
so good .
i want a cheeseburger .
but this is a special soup called pho .
you told me not to say that word .
it is delicious . this is the food of your people .
can i get you anything else ?
actually , um , we &apos;re just trying to teach our daughter
about your country .
and as i &apos;m saying that , i &apos;m hoping you &apos;re from vietnam .
i was born there .
uh , so was lily .
oh . it &apos;s a beautiful country .
um , my family still lives there .
i hate vietnam !
lily , honey , we don &apos;t hate .
i hate vietnam .
okay , um , we need just a second .
lily , that was rude .
i wanna go home .
no . it &apos;s important that you celebrate the culture of your ancestors .
you are vietnamese .
no , i &apos;m not . i &apos;m gay ! i &apos;m gay !
honey , no , you &apos;re not gay . you are just confused .
oh , my god . what is wrong with me ? it &apos;s like i ...
oh , please . we have tons of lesbian friends .
odd that you would reference our friends and not us .
i know . i know .
also gay .
we should just go .
no , nobody &apos;s going anywhere
until she finishes the whole soup !
no , gloria , it &apos;s fine .
we don &apos;t wanna push her . no , no , no , it &apos;s not fine .
that &apos;s the problem with this country .
nobody cares where they come from .
they just want cheeseburgers and prep school ,
and they have forgotten about colombia !
okay , i can &apos;t help but feel
that maybe you &apos;re bringing something to the table
that &apos;s possibly , uh , not at all about lily .
i think you &apos;re right .
it &apos;s just that i feel like i &apos;m losing my children to america .
they &apos;re just going to grow up
and become boring old white people .
uh , most of our friends are white , actually .
uh ... okay , can everybody just calm down
and go back to their own conversations ?
just ... thank you .
hey . hey , what &apos;s going on with you ?
manny has forgotten most of his spanish ,
and joe--i &apos;m sure he &apos;s not even going to learn it .
i know this is silly , but i just don &apos;t like
feeling like i &apos;m so different from the rest of my family .
oh , honey .
it feels so lonely , yes .
oh , wait just a second .
lily , is that why you want to be gay ,
to be more like your daddies ?
oh , honey . no , the three of us are a family
even though we come from different places .
you know , you were born in vietnam ,
and i grew up in a city ,
and even though he never talks about it ,
your daddy grew up on a farm .
yeah .
the point is , is that we &apos;re a family
because we love each other .
okay .
and you know what ?
you just caused a scene in a restaurant ...
and you can &apos;t get any more like your daddies than that .
maybe i &apos;ll just take manny and joe
to colombia this summer .
i think that &apos;s a great idea .
i really think that keeping in touch with your heritage
only enriches our culture .
absolutely . i think we would all be better off
if people would go back to where they came from .
i ...
i &apos;ll pull the car around .
yes .
all i can think about are the good times i had with mom .
who &apos;s gonna walk me down the aisle ?
stop spinning out .
there &apos;s no point in imagining some horrible future .
hey , buddy .
you made it .
you &apos;re in heaven .
that &apos;s not funny .
okay .
knock , knock .
don &apos;t bother . she &apos;s not in the mood for jokes .
your results are great .
minimal plaque . your heart is strong .
thank you . that &apos;s such good news .
well , keep taking your medication ,
you &apos;ll outlive all of us .
thanks .
honey , you nailed it .
you weren &apos;t worried , were you ?
no .
me , neither .
i wasn &apos;t done with that .
me , neither .
god , do you soak your hair in cigarettes ?
do you wash your clothes in tears ?
i have to get home . my roommate needs these shoes .
weirdos .
luke , don &apos;t be so mean . i can &apos;t take it today .
i may be your sort of mom now ...
and i &apos;m practically a child myself .
okay , let &apos;s calm down .
mom could be fine .
oh , come on . they wouldn &apos;t be freaking out if they were fine .
right , &apos; cause mom and dad never freak out over nothing .
they don &apos;t . they &apos;re perfect .
remember the time when dad was switching jobs ,
and mom threw away all of our junk food ?
that was completely different .
no , no , actually , it &apos;s not .
they don &apos;t know how to deal with their stuff ,
so they obsess over us .
maybe that &apos;s all this is , right ?
i can &apos;t believe how relieved i am .
me , too . i &apos;m just texting the kids .
it &apos;s like at a certain age , &quot; it &apos;s probably nothing &quot;
becomes &quot; it &apos;s probably nothing . &quot;
like they add italics at 40 .
well , the good news is ...
these situations just bring us closer and closer together .
by the way , you did a great job of keeping your cool .
well , i didn &apos;t want to scare the kids .
you did a pretty good job yourself .
thanks .
i have a secret .
what &apos;s that ?
we &apos;re pretty good at this parenting thing .
i think we are .
kiss me .
i &apos;m gonna try .
&quot; mom ok &quot; ? !
you guys are the worst parents ever .
it &apos;s the same every time !
one of you guys goes through something stressful ,
and instead of dealing with it , you freak out on us .
&quot; quit your job , &quot; &quot; don &apos;t quit your job &quot; ?
&quot; read more , &quot; &quot; read less &quot; ?
be better at being adults !
come on , luke . let &apos;s go !
you &apos;re not my mom anymore , but okay !
save the judgey looks for another 15 years .
what the hell happened in there ?
i don &apos;t know . i &apos;ve never choked like that before .
you think it &apos;s a definite no ?
well , you pointed to a picture of the dean &apos;s son
and asked when she &apos;s due .
right .
sorry i let you down , jay .
me ?
i saw how much it meant to you .
it &apos;s like i was on the football field .
you were up in the stands , all proud of me , rooting me on .
i &apos;m not used to that . i just whiffed .
that &apos;s not even the right sport .
why am i trying to blame you ?
probably &apos; cause you should be . sit down .
i think i put some stuff on you that ...
is about some guys 40 years ago
with tiny noses and perfect hair .
you &apos;re losing me .
there &apos;s only thing i want you to understand .
if today was the first time
you &apos;ve felt that i was proud of you ,
then i should be apologizing ,
&apos;cause i &apos;m proud of you every day .
thanks , jay .
let &apos;s go .
did i really bet him
i could fit his whole cell phone in my mouth ?
forget about that guy . you &apos;re never gonna see him again .
i &apos;m not sure about that .
wait here .
kernels in ?
check .
on the right side only ?
check .
you know this is the last of our batter , right ?
our backs are against the wall .
last chance at mastering the self @-@ flipping pancake .
you mean &quot; popcake . &quot;
i was thinking &quot; flipjack . &quot;
oh , of course !
it &apos;s okay .
okay .
this is the one . i feel it .
if this works , centuries from now ,
someone &apos;s gonna dig one of these things up
and wonder what the heck it is .
5 ... 4 ...
3 ... 2 ...
flip !
flip , damn you !
it &apos;s over .
no , it &apos;s not !
it &apos;s over !
it &apos;s all right .
we left it all out there on the griddle .
we live to fight another day .
yeah . i guess .
i can &apos;t believe we wasted all that batter .
ah , i guess you can &apos;t make an omelet
without breaking a few eggs . am i right ?
or can we ?
