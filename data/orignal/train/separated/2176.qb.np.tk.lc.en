keep reeling it in , babe , you almost got it .
a little help would be nice , babe .
no way , you &apos;re doing great .
oh ! if this thing pulls me in ,
you aren &apos;t getting any
for the rest of our honeymoon .
what the hell was that ?
i don &apos;t know , man ,
but a piece of it hit the boat .
looks like some kind of metal .
oh , my god .
my job is not leaving anybody behind .
freddie , you hit ?
i &apos;m fine . keep moving .
tell my daughter ... her daddy loved her .
get the hell out of here , you stubborn son of a bitch !
thanks for coming .
i &apos;m glad you called .
i &apos;ve been thinking a lot about our last conversation .
how you wanted to know what brought me back to hawaii .
well , a month ago , i would &apos;ve told you it was ...
to find the man who killed my father .
i realized it was about more than that .
i lost somebody .
somebody really close to me .
he , um ... he gave his life to save mine .
what was his name ?
his name was freddie hart .
he was a team guy .
we went through buds together .
we always had each other &apos;s back .
he was my brother .
more than anything else in this world ,
freddie wanted to be a father . that was it .
he would &apos;ve been a great father , too .
anyway , after he died , um ...
the navy didn &apos;t feel the same .
when the governor offered me five @-@ o ,
i jumped at it .
you ran away .
yeah .
we think that distance is gonna make things better ,
and for a while it kind of does .
but sooner or later , it catches up to you that ...
the real problem you &apos;re having is all up here .
you sleeping ?
when was the last time you had a good night &apos;s sleep ?
well ...
like i said , i &apos;m glad you called .
thanks .
you better get going , man . you got a big day ahead of you .
yeah .
try not to have too much fun today .
爱你的妈妈
ma .
in here .
i made you lunch .
really ? that &apos;s very nice .
tuna salad .
that &apos;s nice , with the pickles and the celery
and the carrots and everything .
yes , and a whole lot of mama love .
it , uh ... it brings back some memories , uh ...
that one time you , uh ...
you sold my entire baseball card collection
at the garage sale .
you made me ... you made me tuna salad .
and then , uh ... you said we were gonna
go see gremlins , and then , uh , we made a left
and we went to the dentist and you got me braces .
you made me tuna salad , just like this .
i feel like every time you , um ...
you do something that you feel guilty about ,
you make me a tuna salad , so i have to ask ,
is , uh , something coming ? or what @-@ what &apos;s going on ?
no , nothing .
no ?
no , i just ... i @-@ i am invading your space
by being here , and i just wanted
to do something nice for you .
for my son .
okay .
okay , that &apos;s me . i got to go .
i &apos;ll see you later , all right , sweetheart ?
where , uh ... where are you going ?
what &apos;s going on ?
i &apos;m going to do that thing .
what , uh ... what thing ?
you know that thing that i asked you
to do with me but you said that you couldn &apos;t do ?
no , no , no . i don &apos;t know .
clara ?
yes , captain .
oh , call me lou .
lou grover .
all right , lou .
all right . what , uh ...
what are you doing here , lou ?
mcgarrett didn &apos;t tell you ?
no . tell me what ?
well , remember when i asked you
if i could see what you do
and you said that i couldn &apos;t ?
oh , that &apos;s the thing .
yeah . go on a stakeout .
which i said was a terrible idea .
right .
so i called your friend steve and he said
that he thought it was perfectly fine ,
so he arranged for me to go
on a ride @-@ along with this very nice gentleman .
a ride @-@ along ?
yeah .
so , we &apos;ll see you later .
okay .
okay . let &apos;s go .
all this here you &apos;re doing ,
that &apos;s between you and mcgarrett .
just stop for one second , okay ?
all i am saying is that a heads @-@ up
would &apos;ve been nice . okay ?
that &apos;s all .
you &apos;re so worked up about this .
oh , oh , okay , listen , um , i know this may seem like
a foreign concept to you , but the idea of my mother
being in harm &apos;s way-- it does not sit well with me .
you got to give her more credit , danny .
i mean , she survived you .
you &apos;re not a good friend .
in fact , you &apos;re no longer my friend .
i &apos;m done . good run .
it &apos;s been fun .
you &apos;re just mad
because she went behind your back .
it &apos;s got nothing to do with me .
i am mad because she has all these secret agendas .
okay , i mean she &apos;s always been very impulsive ,
but this is just goofy ; it &apos;s crazy .
thank goodness you &apos;re being levelheaded about it .
you know what ? go ahead , walk ahead of me .
i don &apos;t want to talk to you anymore .
walk ahead of you ?
please do .
hey , heard your mom &apos;s going on a ride @-@ along today .
oh , that &apos;s nice . everybody knows but me .
pay no attention to him .
he woke up on the wrong side of life .
what do we got here ?
we got three vics .
a couple of honeymooners took a fishing charter this morning .
coast guard found their bodies
along with the boat &apos;s captain about an hour ago .
c.o.d. &apos; s multiple gunshot wounds .
no witnesses so far .
oh , we &apos;re not exactly sure what that is yet .
coast guard was responding to reports
of a fiery object falling into the ocean
when they found the boat .
akualele .
it was a falling star ?
yeah , we &apos;re thinking that the damage was caused by whatever fell .
stop . go back .
fiery object ?
wait a minute .
if it wasn &apos;t a falling star , what was it ?
still trying to figure that out .
we reached out to the navy ,
but nothing came across their radar this morning ,
and coast guard didn &apos;t find any other debris .
looks like carbon graphite .
that &apos;s what a comet &apos;s made of , right ?
no , danny , that &apos;s not what a comet &apos;s made of .
okay . so , uh , something falls from the sky ,
our three victims end up with bullets .
i &apos;m assuming this is not a coincidence , hmm ?
hey , max .
after a preliminary examination , i was able to determine
that the time of death is approximately two hours ago .
all victims have multiple gunshot wounds .
many of them through and through .
csu was able to recover several of these .
it &apos;s a 7.62 slug .
csu determined them to be type m43s .
chinese and russian military use that type of ammo .
we could be looking at a foreign shooter .
all right , kono , notify the coast guard .
see if they can run gps on this fishing vessel .
find out where it was two hours ago .
i want divers searching a one @-@ mile radius from wherever that spot is .
if we can find the rest of this thing ,
maybe we can figure out what it is .
yeah , you got it .
yeah . mcgarrett .
don &apos;t make any sudden moves , commander .
just be cool
and turn slowly to your left .
jerry , what are you doing here ?
i heard about your shooting
and the falling object on my police scanner .
let me guess , it &apos;s carbon graphite ?
stealth technology ?
i &apos;ll take it by the dead air that that &apos;s a yes .
hey , let him through .
he &apos;s all right .
what &apos;s going on ?
looks like jerry knows something .
this should be good .
my boys .
i missed you guys .
reunion hug . bring it in .
all right , jerry .
sweet .
the band &apos;s back together .
jerry , focus .
what do you know about this ?
gentlemen , the black unicorn has landed in our backyard .
black uni ... another ancient treasure ?
not a sequel , scully .
it &apos;s way better .
what &apos;s a black unicorn ?
a chinese spy satellite .
last year , the boys in beijing
launched two weather satellites on the same day ,
but witnesses on the ground reported seeing a third object
being sent into space around the same time .
the black unicorn .
exactly .
appreciate the save .
anyhow , the black unicorn
is a stealthy next @-@ gen electro @-@ optical
and audio reconnaissance orbiter .
it makes our kh @-@ 12s
look like they &apos;re on training wheels .
will you speak english for me , please ?
with this thing , we got no secrets .
nsa can &apos;t do anything about it ,
&apos;cause they aren &apos;t even sure it exists .
and china , they denied ever building it .
but ... six months ago ,
the unicorn &apos;s schematics were leaked .
obviously , i got my paws on &apos; em .
a few days ago , i picked up some chatter
that , due to a malfunction ,
it was coming down somewhere in the pacific .
okay , so that means that if our vic saw this thing go down ,
that could be the reason they &apos;re dead .
i don &apos;t want to piss off 1.3 billion people , but ...
your victims must have seen the black unicorn ,
and somebody wanted to make sure they didn &apos;t live to tell about it .
okay , i got a question .
whatever he &apos;s talking about sounds like an international incident .
so if he knows about it ,
don &apos;t you think somebody else knows about it ?
it &apos;s a fair question .
but jerry is one for one .
if he &apos;s right ,
it &apos;s a secret worth killing for .
sorry , commander , i think it &apos;s more than a reach
to say this came from a chinese spy satellite .
i understand , sir--
i &apos;m just asking for you to look into it .
well , i can assure you that won &apos;t be necessary .
not only does our government track
every satellite launched across the globe ,
but we know months in advance if one &apos;s coming down .
i &apos;m certain all you &apos;re looking at here is nothing but space junk .
space junk ? you think we &apos;re gonna buy that ?
that &apos;s the black unicorn , and you know it .
who the hell do you think you &apos;re talking to , son ?
all due respect , sir ,
i got three dead bodies , and you and i both know
they weren &apos;t killed over space junk .
i wish i could help with your investigation , commander .
now , if you don &apos;t mind , i ...
i have another appointment .
it &apos;ll wait .
excuse me ?
you didn &apos;t look up from that photograph
when you told us it was space junk , sir .
i think you &apos;re lying .
i think you know exactly what it is .
now , you listen to me .
i &apos;m not gonna sit here and be called a liar .
i suggest you get out of here .
focus on your murder investigation .
yes , sir .
if i find out my victims were killed over this ...
sir , you can be damn sure
i &apos;m gonna be focusing on a lot more than their murders .
you have a very nice office .
that was awesome .
we totally stuck it to him .
you didn &apos;t give him my last name , did you ?
&apos;cause that would put me on the list ,
and i don &apos;t want to be on that list .
hey , jerry , you still got those black unicorn schematics ?
sure . safe and sound in my dungeon of truth .
okay , i need you to go get them .
if we can match that piece that we found to those schematics ,
we &apos;ll know for sure it &apos;s the black unicorn .
that &apos;ll give us our motive .
you got it , partner .
too soon ?
little bit .
postmortem microbial deterioration activates
the buildup of metabolic gases
that , combined with the decomposition of dermal tissue slippage ,
causes the body to rise up to the surface ,
which is one of the main reasons
disposing a weighted body into the ocean
isn &apos;t a recommended means
for one trying to get away with murder .
yes , well ,
dr. bergman , that certainly was an education .
mrs. williams , it was truly a pleasure to meet you .
it is quite unfortunate that detective williams
did not inherit your sparkling disposition .
well , thank you ... i think , thank you .
enjoy the rest of your day .
do you have any idea what he just said ?
not a damn clue .
shall we ?
yes . let &apos;s .
so , captain ,
i really appreciate you showing me around .
no problem .
well ... but i &apos;m a little old for a babysitter .
i mean , i loved going to the police museum ,
and the m.e. was riveting .
but i was kind of hoping for something ,
you know , a little more adventurous .
well , i hate to disappoint , but ,
me taking you into the middle of a dangerous situation ...
that &apos;s not gonna happen ?
you know that &apos;s not gonna happen .
not even , like , a sketchy donut shop or something ?
i see where that boy of yours gets his bite .
what about you , you got any kids ?
yeah , i got two teenagers .
mm , yeah , i raised four of them .
i think the teenage years are the hardest .
everybody was always slamming their doors ,
telling me how i ruined their lives ...
well , see , i don &apos;t have that problem anymore .
no ?
i told my daughter
next time she slams her door , it &apos;s coming off .
ooh . big mistake .
she can &apos;t pay the mortgage .
my house , my rules .
we only had one rule in our house ,
and that was : love each other .
and how did that work out ?
one is a fugitive .
he &apos;s a very nice fugitive .
the other one is divorced
and living on an island as far away from his parents
as he can possibly get .
and my two girls , well , they are ...
they &apos;re a whole another story .
right .
but they got love .
yeah .
right . yeah .
i mean , in hindsight , maybe a few rules
wouldn &apos;t have been so bad .
my husband and i , we agreed on a softer touch
than we had when we were growing up .
i get it .
so , you and danny &apos;s father , you think there &apos;s any chance
that the two of you will be able to work things out ?
i don &apos;t know . i &apos;ve been here for two weeks , and ...
he hasn &apos;t called .
after 38 years of marriage ,
if he can &apos;t pick up the phone ,
then what &apos;s the point ?
well , come on , now .
you know men , we &apos;re stubborn s.o.b. &apos; s .
we &apos;d rather eat glass than admit we &apos;re wrong about something .
that &apos;s very true .
clara , you know , i think you &apos;re right .
it &apos;s been a little boring .
but i got just the thing for you .
i know exactly where to take you .
oh , you do ?
hey , how &apos;d it go with the navy ?
they &apos;re stonewalling .
i got more of the same with nsa and homeland .
what about the coast guard ?
they find anything ?
nothing on the ocean floor
or the surrounding waters . but we caught a break .
csu found a cell phone on the charter
belonging to the newlyweds .
it was damaged by a bullet , but fong was able to recover video .
looks like our vic got an image of the shooter .
ran it through facial recognition .
didn &apos;t get any hits , but take a look at what &apos;s behind him .
salvage equipment and divers .
no wonder the coast guard didn &apos;t find anything .
okay , so china knew this satellite was coming down .
they came in to retrieve it and cover it up .
our vics were wrong place , wrong time .
you know , there aren &apos;t many places on the island
that rent boats with salvage equipment .
kono and i will track it down .
so , i just got off with the consulate general
of the people &apos;s republic of china .
they denied any knowledge of the satellite .
oh , no surprise there .
look , if our shooter is a chinese spy ,
maybe naval intelligence has him on their radar .
catherine , reach out to your sources .
see if they can help us i.d. him , okay , off the record .
got it .
looks like jerry was two for two .
mom ?
turn around .
i don &apos;t know anything .
the satellite schematics .
schematics ? what schematics ?
the @-@ the black unicorn schematics !
of course i have those . should &apos;ve been more specific .
i didn &apos;t realize that &apos;s what you were referring to .
they &apos;re right over here .
yeah , here they are .
mcgarrett , it &apos;s jerry . you better come quick .
i think i bagged a live one .
姓名 凯伦 · 周
jerry .
what the hell &apos;s going on , jerry ?
two words : take down .
actually , four : totally awesome take down .
she was packing this .
it &apos;s a type 92 pistol ,
standard issue , chinese military .
but no wallet or i.d.
how do you know that ?
i frisked her .
how many times you do that ?
i got her prints , too .
had one of my contacts run it .
i.d. came back as a karen chou , grad student here on a visa .
yeah , right .
my name is steve mcgarrett . i &apos;m with five @-@ o ,
but you , uh ... you probably already know that .
i &apos;ll tell you what we know :
we know that your government sent you to recover their satellite .
okay ? so spare me any denials .
i got three innocent people who are dead .
you &apos;re gonna tell me the names
of all the people on that boat with you ,
starting with this guy .
i had nothing to do with those murders .
the man &apos;s picture you have , his name is quan lung .
he &apos;s a traitor to my country .
my name is zi chen .
mss .
chinese cia . cool .
i &apos;ll just be right here if you need me .
i was sent with a team to stop quan
and cover up the satellite &apos;s existence ,
but he beat us to it .
by the time we got where it hit the water ,
the people were already dead .
quan was gone .
he &apos;s after the intel on that satellite .
the onboard hard drive holds
key u.s. military positions at sea :
submarine deployments , training exercises .
information he plans to sell to one of your enemies .
if he succeeds ,
the united states will be vulnerable to an attack .
danny , you stay with her .
i &apos;m gonna have dhs come pick her up .
you &apos;re not going to be able to stop him on your own .
i have a lead
on quan &apos;s base of operations here on the island .
an address .
i can help you catch him .
but only if we work together .
just hang in there .
it &apos;s almost over .
you , too .
how &apos;s adam doing ?
not good . his deposition &apos;s today .
he and his attorneys are meeting with the p.a.
he has to give a statement about michael &apos;s death .
well , it &apos;s just red tape , cuz .
everybody knows it was self @-@ defense .
yeah , that doesn &apos;t mean it makes it any easier on him .
aloha .
hey . can i help you ?
yeah . wonder if you can help us out here .
this guy .
do you recognize him ?
yeah ...
yeah . he came by , uh , earlier today .
rented a boat with a credit card .
said he was going treasure hunting .
it &apos;s our guy .
yeah .
when did he return the boat ?
a few hours ago .
did he find any treasure ?
he had something with him , but i don &apos;t know what it was .
jerry , catherine &apos;s on her way over . bring her up to speed .
okay ? get in .
ask her to have her source at navy intel run zi chen .
see if they can verify what she told us .
catherine ? nice .
i got to go freshen up .
what &apos;s with the face ?
you don &apos;t see how ... incredibly insane this is ?
she gave us an address . we &apos;re gonna go check it out .
right . she gave us an address . that &apos;s my point .
i mean , how do you know she &apos;s not setting us up ?
how can i know that until we check it out ?
see , that @-@ that ... you just want to flip a coin and see ?
it &apos;s insane . please . use your brain , okay ?
she &apos;s a @-@ a chinese spy . okay ?
she tried to kill jerry .
she &apos;s potentially responsible for the ...
death of our three victims , and you just believe her
because she said she &apos;s innocent ? &quot; i &apos;m innocent . &quot; i ...
you bel ... i don &apos;t get it .
you &apos;re still mad at me about your mom , aren &apos;t you ?
there &apos;s no helping you . at all .
be careful now . there &apos;s a crowd .
all right , watch .
whoa ! hey , whoa . what &apos;re you doing ?
you almost took that old lady &apos;s head off .
well , i &apos;m sorry . i thought she had a glock 9 behind her bag .
a glock 9 ?
yeah . you didn &apos;t think i was paying attention
at the museum , did you ?
oops !
what do you mean , &quot; oops &quot; ?
oh ! i got him . oh !
good , good , good , good .
all right , kev , moment of truth , how &apos;d we do ?
lou , you scored in the 98th percentile .
show @-@ off . how did i do ?
bottom third .
but if there was a metric for looking good in tac gear ,
you &apos;d lead all comers .
i tell you what ,
if you ever want to come back by , give it another try ,
give me a call .
okay .
thank you , kevin .
i think i just got hit on .
i believe you did . yeah .
this is the address .
take your seat .
let me see your hands . hands .
should we , uh , call for backup ?
backup ?
you &apos;re my backup .
last time you said that , i got shot in the shoulder .
could &apos;ve been worse .
clandestine meeting with a top secret government agent ?
bucket meet list .
should we pretend to be a couple ?
uh ... you know what ?
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s gonna be necessary , jerry .
what about aliases ?
do you use one ? should i ?
i ... well ... here she is .
vicki .
thank you so much for meeting me .
this is jerry .
nice to meet you , jerry .
you , too .
oh ! so , we &apos;re just gonna do this out here in the open .
don &apos;t mind him .
intel on zi chen and quan lung .
really , really appreciate this . thank you .
after istanbul , i owe you .
it &apos;s good to see you , cath .
you , too .
may i ?
knock yourself out .
it &apos;s my team .
they must have moved on the house .
quan killed them .
it &apos;s a good thing you were at jerry &apos;s , right ?
these were not just people i worked with .
they were my friends .
that &apos;s it .
hard drive &apos;s gone .
c4 , looks like he was making a bomb .
a bomb ?
that &apos;s good . what &apos;s he making it for ?
wait , wait ! don &apos;t touch !
nobody move .
danny ?
we got to get out of here .
let &apos;s clear all the houses next door .
get the bomb guys suited up and get them in there .
hi , ma .
are you okay ?
yes , i &apos;m okay . i &apos;m fine .
this doesn &apos;t happen all the time , does it ?
no , this never happens .
yeah , you &apos;re a really bad liar .
ma , you can &apos;t , uh ... you can &apos;t be here .
buddy , hey , do me a favor .
oh , come on .
uh , show her your police car , all right ?
ma , it &apos;s not safe . please ? you got to go .
i &apos;ve seen a police car .
i understand . see another one .
what the hell &apos;s the matter with you ?
i asked her to stay in the car .
what do you want me to do ?
clear !
okay , we &apos;re all clear in there .
so , i figure we ought to get you guys
a five @-@ o grover signal .
that way , you can just throw it up in the sky when you need me .
oh , trust me , nobody wants to see your name in lights .
yeah , and nobody on the planet wants to see you in tights .
oh , i &apos;ll settle for just a cape .
a cape ? okay , batman .
please take care of my mom .
please ?
like she was my own .
thank you .
now do you believe me ?
quan knew i &apos;d come here .
he rigged their bodies to make sure i wouldn &apos;t stop him .
all right , well , now that he thinks you &apos;re dead ,
we got the advantage , don &apos;t we ?
yeah , catherine , what do you got ?
no , no . thanks .
got something you want to tell us ?
do you have something you want to tell us ? !
you see , her and quan , they didn &apos;t just work together .
isn &apos;t that right ?
isn &apos;t that right ? tell him .
quan and i were engaged .
really ?
now , if i told you about our relationship ,
i knew you would never trust me .
that &apos;s correct . i didn &apos;t trust you before .
that bomb was meant for me .
see , that usually happens after the marriage , no ?
yeah , i know how it looks .
but i &apos;m telling you the truth .
quan betrayed me .
now , he was always talking about the hypocrisy in china .
a socialist state making billions off the west
while our people got hungry .
but i knew he was really talking about himself .
two months ago , he learned the satellite was coming down .
told me we could retrieve it .
sell the information .
with that money , we could leave china .
now , he said he was doing it for us .
but i told him i would never betray our country .
okay , so why didn &apos;t you turn him in ?
i never thought he would really do it .
then he disappeared a week ago , and i knew .
mss holds me responsible .
it was my duty to stop this from happening , and i didn &apos;t .
if i don &apos;t stop him , they &apos;ll charge me with treason .
and they won &apos;t just go after me ; they &apos;ll go after my family .
tell us how to find him .
i need access to a computer .
why ?
72 hours ago , we intercepted a communication
between quan and an unknown ip address in chechnya .
mss thinks a terrorist organization
is trying to buy the satellite data
to launch an attack against the u.s.
and you thought you &apos;d just , uh , hang on to that information ,
that little bit of intel as a bargaining chip ?
chin .
steve , we tried the credit card that quan used to rent the boat .
he had dinner at a hotel in kahala last night .
and he wasn &apos;t alone .
who was he with ?
a hotel guest by the name of umar basayev .
a waiter i.d. &apos; d both of them .
we checked him out .
he &apos;s a chechen businessman .
he flew into oahu 48 hours ago .
okay , good . he &apos;s our buyer . where is he now ?
front desk said he left just before we showed up .
but here &apos;s the thing .
he hasn &apos;t checked out .
fine . stay on the hotel .
we &apos;ll keep working on the location of the buy .
copy that .
your intel on the chechen connection &apos;s good .
you believe me ?
yeah , for now . come on .
let &apos;s go .
i thought that i wanted to know what daniel does for a living ,
and now i kind of wish that i didn &apos;t .
you sound like my wife .
she shares the exact same sentiment .
here we go , crime fighters .
you got heaven all in garlic sauce .
you won &apos;t find grinz like that on the jersey shore .
it looks fantastic , smells great .
tell me something , auntie .
that boy of yours--
how come he didn &apos;t inherit your beautiful smile ?
food and flattery .
i have just became a regular .
mission accomplished .
well , that &apos;s the second time you &apos;ve been hit on today .
oh , he was just being sweet .
i don &apos;t know .
don &apos;t sell yourself short .
lou , i just want to thank you so much for today .
i mean , i asked you for an adventure ,
and you sure gave me one .
it was fun . i had a good time , too , clara .
oh , sorry .
hello ?
oh . hi .
yeah , coffee ?
sure . i &apos;m free later .
okay . okay . bye @-@ bye .
that was kevin from the shooting place .
oh . he just asked me out .
on a date ?
i wonder how he got my number .
you mind passing the hot sauce , clara ?
so , i dug into umar basayev ,
and , uh , on the surface , he appears to be pretty clean ,
but his business-- importing rugs
from all over the middle east to russia--
has been the subject of multiple investigations .
in 2011 , his organization was linked to an al @-@ qaeda front ,
but there was never any evidence to make it stick .
so , you show us the communication he sent to quan .
mss e @-@ mail server ?
any chance you &apos;d share your password ?
sorry about the whole stun gun thing .
in fairness , i thought you were there to kill me .
here it is .
look at that .
we got &quot; proof of data . &quot;
&quot; 3 : 00 p.m. at the tailor . &quot;
we should have no problem finding him now .
all right , it &apos;s 2 : 45 .
you said mss intel went over this ?
what was their takeaway ?
we ran it through analysis , found nothing embedded .
research came back
with 84 tailor @-@ related businesses on the island .
what if ...
tailor isn &apos;t a profession , but a person ?
there &apos;s an arcade downtown .
the owner , mikel taylor ,
is a real scary russian dude .
definitely ex @-@ kgb .
looks like mikel taylor &apos;s
been on the fbi watch list since the &apos; 70s .
if this is our guy ,
he &apos;s got to be brokering the deal .
where downtown is this arcade ?
queen street .
catherine , notify grover ,
have swat meet us on site .
and please , uh ,
tell him to leave my mom at home .
got it .
let &apos;s go .
all right .
get in .
get in .
i want to go in .
give me your hands .
quan would rather die than surrender to you .
i &apos;m expecting that .
lou , what do we know ?
well , shop &apos;s closed .
i got thermal that confirms at least seven possible
bad guys inside .
where &apos;s my mom ?
she &apos;s in a van tacking up .
that &apos;s funny .
relax . she &apos;s with
a friend of mine , kevin , from hpd .
he &apos;ll get her home safe . don &apos;t worry .
let &apos;s go .
who &apos;s kevin ?
five @-@ o !
he &apos;s got the hard drive !
danny , i need an ambulance ,
alleyway off queen and alakea .
i spoke to the dod ,
and they reached out to the chinese ambassador .
we &apos;ve arranged for you
and the bodies of your team to be returned home .
and the hard drive ?
we tried to retrieve the intel ,
but it &apos;s been destroyed .
you should take it .
that &apos;s proof your mission was a success .
you didn &apos;t have to help me .
no , i didn &apos;t , but i know what it &apos;s like to serve my country .
he didn &apos;t give you a choice .
in my culture , respect is a virtue .
you have mine , commander mcgarrett .
thank you .
he &apos;s at the third bench , 100 yards up .
sorry about the runaround earlier .
nothing personal .
catherine rollins recovered the intel .
it &apos;s all there .
what about the hard drive ?
erased .
i returned it to agent chen .
and she believed we were unable to retrieve the data ?
that &apos;s correct .
you &apos;ve done your country a great service , commander .
we now know what the enemy knows ,
and we can adjust accordingly .
job well done .
three innocent people lost their lives over this one .
make it count .
what &apos;s going on , jerry ?
i can &apos;t go back home .
why not ?
i stun @-@ gunned a chinese spy in my mom &apos;s basement .
i could be facing some serious retaliation .
jerry , the threat &apos;s been neutralized .
you &apos;re completely safe .
you have no idea how this works , do you ?
i need to lie low for a while .
i sent my mom to her sister &apos;s , and i ...
thought i &apos;d stay with you .
you know , just till this dies down .
okay .
sweet .
we &apos;re going over some ground rules first , jerry .
whatever you say , roomie .
what are you doing up ?
&quot; what am i doing up ? &quot; is that a joke ?
you didn &apos;t have to wait up for me , you know .
i know , i know , but ...
as strange as it is for me to say the words ,
&quot; my mother &apos;s on a date , &quot;
when my mother &apos;s on a date , i @-@ i wait up .
well , i appreciate that , sweetheart ,
but it really wasn &apos;t a big deal .
what , was he a jerk ?
no , not at all . here .
&apos;cause if he was , i &apos;ll find him
and bounce his head off the sidewalk .
daniel , he was really a perfect gentleman .
okay .
what &apos;s with the ice cream ?
at first , i thought it would be really exciting
to be on a date with another man .
and don &apos;t get me wrong-- it was nice to have somebody
look at me that way again , you know ?
but it was strange
and kind of weird .
yeah .
yeah , well , i know why .
because it wasn &apos;t ... it wasn &apos;t with pop , you know ?
yeah , i know .
you want to watch a movie ?
yeah .
yeah , come on .
