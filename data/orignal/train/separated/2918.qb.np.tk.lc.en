oh , my god , you cleaned ! look at these floors !
you did the windows ! i have been begging you for months ! and you did , you cleaned .
and nagging works !
no , i didn &apos;t actually do this .
oh , no . was i cleaning in my sleep again ?
no , it wasn &apos;t you .
well , then , who ?
i got a maid . yay !
i hope by &quot; maid &quot; you mean &quot; mistress &quot; because if some other woman was cleaning ..
now , honey , i know you don &apos;t like to relinquish control .
&quot; relinquish &quot; is just a fancy word for &quot; lose . &quot;
she &apos;s nice , and she mentioned that she adored the way you arranged the sponges .
did she really say that ?
yes , i distinctly remember because i thought it was a joke .
now , just give her a chance , okay ?
fine , i can do it .
what &apos;s the matter ?
usually when i &apos;m this anxious , i clean .
the.one.with.the.stain
whose cell phone is that ? it &apos;s just so annoying . everywhere you go .
i think it &apos;s coming from your bag .
i never get calls !
hello ?
hi , it &apos;s eric , from the halloween party . ursula &apos;s fiance .
oh , my god , eric , hi ! wait , how &apos;d you get this number ?
i have a friend who &apos;s a cop , and he got it for me .
wow . what an incredible violation and wonderful surprise !
listen , i just .. i thought you should know i broke up with ursula .
oh , you did ? he did it , he did it !
what did he do ?
i &apos;m talking !
anyway , i was wondering if you were the sort of person who eats lunch ?
are you asking me out ?
because it &apos;d be kind of weird since you just broke up with my sister .
yeah , okay . i &apos;m sorry . bye .
no , no . wait ! i was just saying that so you &apos;d think i was a good person .
fight for me .
i won &apos;t take &quot; no &quot; for an answer .
not great , but we can work on it at lunch .
i can be at your apartment in two hours .
great . how do you know where i live ?
i &apos;ve got friends too .
okay , bye .
oh , my god , i &apos;m going out with eric !
this day is really gonna be so much better than i thought it was gonna be .
oh , ross , i can &apos;t make lunch .
so apparently i &apos;m available for lunch .
i can &apos;t . i &apos;m busy . i &apos;m apartment hunting .
you &apos;re moving ?
i can &apos;t live with joey once the baby comes .
i don &apos;t want my child &apos;s first words to be , &quot; how you doing ? &quot;
so does joey know you &apos;re moving ?
i haven &apos;t discussed it with him , but i know he &apos;ll be relieved .
last week , he brought this girl over , and i talked to her about morning sickness .
then i showed her pictures from my pregnancy book .
that &apos;s not really porn ?
not so much .
i heard in the elevator this morning that a woman in my building died .
oh , my god . was she old ? does she have a view ?
i don &apos;t know , but how great would that be ? you living in my building ?
i could take care of the baby , i could come over whenever i want ..
with your permission .
that really would be great . well , can we see it ?
maybe we shouldn &apos;t . i mean , if she just died this morning .
yeah . no . no , you &apos;re right .
shall we ?
yeah .
yes ?
hi . i &apos;m ross geller . i live in the building .
and i &apos;m rachel , an admirer of the building .
i heard about mrs. verhoeven passing away , and i am so sorry for your loss .
she didn &apos;t pass away .
what ?
my mother &apos;s still alive .
oh , thank god !
it looked like we were gonna lose her this morning , but she &apos;s a tough old bird .
are you close with her ?
of course . she and i would talk all the time ..
in the laundry room .
you speak dutch ?
you know , i would , but it &apos;s just too painful .
so she &apos;s really not dead .
no . she &apos;s hanging in there .
could you tell me , is she hanging in in a one @-@ bedroom or a two ?
mrs. bing , this tile cleaner is incredible . where did you get it ?
oh , well .. i make it myself .
it &apos;s two parts ammonia and one part lemon juice . the secret ingredient is ..
you know what ? we just met .
okay . i &apos;m gonna go get the clothes from the laundry room now .
when i come back , i &apos;ll clean behind the refrigerator .
i love her .
i &apos;ll be back in a minute .
okay .
see ? i told you .
she stole my jeans !
what ?
i &apos;ve been looking for them all week , and she is wearing them .
so she stole your pants and then came back and wore them in front of you ?
don &apos;t you see ? it &apos;s the perfect crime !
she must have been planning this for years !
i &apos;ll prove it to you , okay .
i dropped a pen in my lap , and it left an ink stain on the crotch .
when she comes back , i will find it and show you that stain !
isn &apos;t it possible the company that sold the jeans made more than just the one pair ?
i guess .
shouldn &apos;t we give her the benefit of the doubt before we snoop around her crotch ?
fine . i &apos;m just glad i didn &apos;t give her my secret ingredient .
out of curiosity , what is your secret ingredient ?
yeah .
hi .
come in . i &apos;m so glad you &apos;re here .
yeah . me too .
not in the shaky , angry way that you are , though .
sorry . i just saw ursula . i had to get the engagement ring back .
just seeing her brought it all back .
all the lies , the way she used me .
i just .. i get so angry , just looking at her ..
face .
yeah . yeah .
i &apos;m sorry . it &apos;s just , when i look at you ..
i see her .
and when i see her , i get a little bit angry .
so where do you wanna eat ?
not that i &apos;m not enjoying watching you flip out .
sorry .
maybe this is too weird .
wait .
there &apos;s only a problem when i look at you .
i got it . i got it .
no , don &apos;t tear out your eyes !
i was just gonna take out my lenses .
oh , yeah . try that .
so is that better ?
not really .
you &apos;re blurry , but you still look like ursula . you &apos;re &quot; blursula . &quot;
okay , wait . maybe ..
if i just don &apos;t look at you for a while .
see ? it works . i &apos;m not angry at all anymore . this is a great date !
yeah , not so much .
it &apos;s kind of hard to have a conversation .
oh , no . sure , we can have a conversation .
tell me a little something about yourself .
oh , me ?
look , eric , turn around .
i like you , but it shouldn &apos;t be this hard . this is our first date .
first dates are supposed to be about excitement and electricity and ..
&quot; he just touched my hand , did he mean to ? &quot; and first kisses ..
second kisses .
thanks for the coffee , or :
yeah , we &apos;re done .
hey , ross . you wanna go see that new lmax movie on tide pools ?
really ?
no .
but i got knicks tickets for you , me and chandler .
sweet !
and then afterwards , we can go to a strip joint .
really ?
no .
all right , let &apos;s go .
i have to stop by my place .
to tape the game ? you do this every time . you &apos;re not gonna be on tv !
no , i have to see if this apartment became available .
you &apos;re switching apartments ?
it &apos;s not for me , it &apos;s for rachel .
she has an apartment .
when the baby comes , she &apos;s gonna move .
she is ?
yeah .
you didn &apos;t expect her to live there with the baby ?
i didn &apos;t really think about it .
hey , gunther , you &apos;re an ezel .
damn it !
nice jeans .
oh , thanks .
i like your top .
oh . you &apos;re not getting it .
what happened ?
oh . i fell asleep !
i was thinking about taking my lunch break .
will you do the top of the cabinets ? that &apos;ll work up your appetite for lunch .
all right .
hello .
what &apos;s going on ?
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;ve never had a maid before . is this not okay ?
i don &apos;t understand .
why was your head just between my legs ?
that &apos;s a fair question .
well , my head was between your legs ..
because i find you very attractive .
are you coming onto me ?
apparently .
hey .
hey .
how was the game ?
it was okay . i ate way too much .
i was talking to ross , and he said you were looking for a new place .
yeah . hopefully across the street . if certain dutch people would just let go .
i was kind of hoping you &apos;d stay .
joey , i have to go . there &apos;s no room for a baby here .
no room ? it &apos;s a baby . it &apos;s , like , this big .
you could put it over here .
or we could put it right here . it &apos;s cute , right ?
or put it over here . you wouldn &apos;t even notice it .
&quot; where &apos;s the baby ? &quot; &quot; oh , it &apos;s right over .. &quot;
honey , it &apos;s not just a matter of where you put it .
a baby changes everything . they cry all the time .
imagine bringing home some girl and trying to score with a screaming baby .
i could use a challenge . it &apos;s getting pretty easy .
it &apos;s so sweet that you want me to stay , but i can &apos;t .
it would disrupt your entire life .
it &apos;s just .. i love living with you so much .
i wish things didn &apos;t have to change .
i know .
you know , i blame ross for this .
i do too , a little bit .
i &apos;m gonna miss you .
you &apos;re the hottest roommate i ever had .
oh , no , i have to go . i have a massage appointment .
no , stay here . we &apos;ll keep doing this . i &apos;ll pay you .
no , i &apos;ve gotten in trouble for that before .
i &apos;ll see you later ?
absolutely .
i love the way you kiss .
really ? that &apos;s the thing i &apos;m worst at ! you &apos;ll see .
hey .
hey . i think brenda needs a raise .
how come ?
because i put my head between her legs .
to see her pants ?
they &apos;re my pants !
are you sure ? did you see the stain ?
no . i was getting into position , and then everything went dark .
she is not stealing from us , okay . will you let this go ?
fine .
she &apos;s wearing my bra !
oh , dear god !
my pink , flowered bra ! i recognize the strap !
yet you don &apos;t recognize that you &apos;re crazy ?
here &apos;s the plan . i &apos;m going to leave , and you &apos;re gonna look at brenda &apos;s bra .
here &apos;s another plan . no .
i would do it , but she thinks i &apos;m attracted to her .
why ?
did you not hear where my head was ?
we &apos;re a team . we &apos;re in this together .
i fear a jury will see it the same way .
do this for me . i catch you looking at women &apos;s breasts all the time .
you see that ?
do you see this ?
all right , yes . okay . i get your point .
but if it &apos;s not her bra , will you just let the woman clean ?
yes . you &apos;ll know it &apos;s mine because on the right cup , there &apos;s a very noticeable rip .
you need new clothes .
hi . how is she ?
it &apos;s not looking good .
well , i brought her some bloemen .
that &apos;s so sweet . would you like to say goodbye ? it would mean a lot to her .
oh , i don &apos;t know that it would .
well , her memory is pretty much gone .
all right , then .
hey !
welcome back .
shall we pick up from where we left off ?
i &apos;m still tired from this afternoon .
why ?
the sex .
what sex ?
our sex .
we didn &apos;t have sex .
if i didn &apos;t have sex with you , i had sex with somebody that looked like ..
you had sex with ursula ?
a little bit .
she walked in , i thought she was you and i kissed her and ..
you didn &apos;t notice different clothes ?
i was just so excited to see you .
this is too weird .
no , it &apos;s not . i don &apos;t wanna lose you .
it &apos;s like i was saying to ursula when i was making love ..
yeah . it &apos;s too weird .
so i guess this is it .
yeah .
maybe it &apos;s for the best .
you smell just like her .
yeah , so do you .
what are you doing ?
i &apos;m leaning .
this is where i lean .
okay .
brenda , a bee !
what ?
it &apos;s flown into your blouse , and you better undo your buttons lest it sting you .
i think i know what &apos;s going on here .
you do ?
look , i know it must be hard that your wife is a lesbian ..
but it &apos;s wrong . you &apos;re married .
i totally understand .
okay , good .
could i just see your bra ?
hi .
where &apos;d you get those jeans ?
you gave them to me .
no , i didn &apos;t !
all right , i took them .
i figured it &apos;d be okay because you &apos;ve got a big ink stain on the crotch .
oh , no ! did you take my bra too ?
what bra ?
the pink one with the flowers .
you mean the one you &apos;re wearing ?
i quit !
sounds about right .
what is this ?
this is just to give you an idea .
we can put screens here so that the baby has privacy ..
and maybe a mobile over the crib ..
and here &apos;s a baby monitor which , till the baby comes , we can use as walkie @-@ talkies .
you &apos;re so sweet !
oh , my god ! and you gave the baby hugsy !
that &apos;s really just to show where the baby would go .
why don &apos;t i hold on to him so there &apos;s no confusion .
joey , the baby is gonna be crying . it &apos;s gonna be loud .
i &apos;m loud .
it &apos;s gonna be up all night .
i &apos;m up all night .
it &apos;s gonna poop .
hello !
what about all the women ?
if i &apos;m bringing home a woman who can &apos;t stand a baby ..
then maybe i don &apos;t wanna be with that woman .
or maybe we &apos;ll do it in the bathroom of the club !
but i won &apos;t say stuff like that around the baby .
joey , are you sure ?
yeah . look , i know sometimes it &apos;ll be hard , okay ..
but it &apos;ll also be really , really great .
please , rachel , i really want you to stay .
i want me to stay too . thank you .
joey , look at this crib . it &apos;s so cute .
i know . i found it on the street .
are you .. ? really ? this is in such good condition .
whoa ! what &apos;s under the cover ?
i don &apos;t know .
it &apos;s moving .
it &apos;s got a tail ! get it out of here !
okay !
well , the old lady died . and how do i know ?
because her dying wish was for one last kiss .
and because i &apos;m such a strong , strapping alleenstaande ..
i had to carry her body to the lobby .
you know , and she was not a slight woman .
but i don &apos;t care , because you got the apartment . yes !
yeah . i think i &apos;m gonna stay here .
isn &apos;t that great ?
