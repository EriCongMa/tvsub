so , you &apos;re the governor &apos;s wife , yeah ?
yup .
your husband &apos;s the fella that slept with all those prostitutes ?
yes .
hey , i &apos;m all for forgiveness .
you know , confession ... best thing god ever invented .
actually , i was talking to me ma last night ...
do you want me to read this ?
yeah . sorry .
here . something to play with .
what &apos;s the problem ?
the holiday party .
mr. hayden , could you do me a favor ?
just look this over .
it &apos;s my exit deal from lockhart @-@ gardner .
just see if there are any hidden land mines .
certainly .
thank you .
let &apos;s bring alicia into this .
we have sent out 800 invitations for friday night ,
and we &apos;ve gotten 30 yeses back .
for the holiday party ? 30 yeses ?
yeah , we &apos;re trying to figure out what to do .
we didn &apos;t want to ask you this ,
but ... we need you to invite your husband .
oh , come on , guys , we can &apos;t keep going back to that well .
if the governor comes , there will be a jump in the rsvps .
maybe people are just late rsvping .
let &apos;s just wait another day .
no , the problem is
another firm decided to throw a party that night .
lockhart @-@ gardner ?
yeah .
they &apos;re still trying to starve us . okay .
i &apos;ll make a call , but i &apos;m not promising anything .
okay , thank you .
who &apos;s ... matthew ashbaugh ?
what ?
who &apos;s matthew ashbaugh ?
a ... a client . why ?
special pains are being made to segregate
your interests from his .
you can &apos;t get rid of me , alicia .
i &apos;m always here .
he &apos;s dead .
are his cases dead ?
i don &apos;t know . uh , some might be .
well , this contract attempts to exclude you from any benefits .
hello ?
hello , mrs. ashbaugh ,
this is alicia florrick ... i don &apos;t know if you remember me .
i used to represent your husband .
hello ?
what do you want ?
uh , is this a bad time ?
what do you want ?
um , well , there are some cases , y @-@ your husband &apos;s cases ,
still unresolved , and i &apos;ve since left lockhart @-@ gardner ,
and i was wondering if they were settled to your satisfaction .
you &apos;re not getting his money .
i &apos;m n ... i &apos;m not ... um , what do you mean ?
there already is a will , and if you make a big deal of this ,
i swear i &apos;ll sue you for everything you have .
you &apos;re not getting paid enough , alicia .
tell your friend will that .
my friend ?
will .
gardner .
i thought you meant my will .
your ... what ?
my last will and testament .
you &apos;re a bit slow today , aren &apos;t you ?
mm . i think it &apos;s the music .
can we please turn it down a little ?
and give the nsa a respite ? no .
if it &apos;s driving you crazy , just think what it &apos;s doing to them .
did you find out ?
about matthew ashbaugh .
oh , uh , not yet .
i think it might have something to do with his estate .
that makes sense .
mrs. florrick ,
your husband &apos;s on the line .
robyn .
do me a favor .
you see that man over there ?
ask him if you can record the negotiations .
tell him that you made a mistake and you were supposed to
do it from the beginning and i &apos;m mad at you .
cool .
peter , hi . is everything all right ?
no . why did you wait till today to invite me
to your party on friday ?
it &apos;s a mistake .
we &apos;ve had some arguments around here about imposing on you .
who called you ?
nobody called me .
it was an e @-@ mail invite .
by the way , it wasn &apos;t an imposition .
although i do have to go to dinner with my mother on friday .
oh , okay , peter ,
it &apos;s fine .
no , listen , i really want to go .
mind if i bring mother along ? i think she &apos;d love it .
jackie ?
yeah . can you call her ?
she doesn &apos;t think you like her .
okay .
uh , i got to go . i &apos;ll see you on friday .
you can &apos;t agree to a party without seeing the guest list .
oh , yes , i can . i just did .
no , alicia represents some clients
you do not want to end up in a photo with .
it &apos;ll look bad .
eli , you do what you do .
okay ? but i &apos;m going to my wife &apos;s holiday party .
so , are we ...
are we signing this , or what ?
just a few questions .
if i sign this , i get my capital contribution ?
yes .
and this contract will have no impact on any profit
participation earned during my employment at lockhart @-@ gardner ?
uh , this contract has nothing to do with profit participation .
so , it will have no impact ...
that would follow . it would follow that this contract
will have no impact ... of any profit participation
during my time at lockhart @-@ gardner .
no .
nice try .
that &apos;s yours , this is mine .
what &apos;s wrong ?
nothing &apos;s wrong .
very nice talking to you , robyn ...
and alicia . bye @-@ bye .
that might be all we need . play it back .
what ?
i had it on smacktalk .
so , are we ... are we signing this , or what ?
just a few questions .
if i sign this , i get my capital contribution ?
yes .
uh , my nephews , they were playing with it .
... will have no impact
on any profit participation earned ...
so it will have no impact ?
it does that when you push the farting button .
and you pushed
the farting button ?
not on purpose .
... profit participation during ...
mrs. florrick ?
yes ?
this is ... a bit of a surprise .
uh , you haven &apos;t signed the exit contract ?
no , not yet . why ?
i called an old acquaintance in probate court
about mr. ashbaugh &apos;s estate .
a contending will has been discovered .
okay .
there were two beneficiaries .
the smile train , a charity .
it &apos;s been bequeathed $ 12 million .
and you have been bequeathed the rest .
how much is the rest ?
$ 12 million .

oh , hello , alicia , hello .
i @-@ i &apos;m sorry , i have a phone now .
it &apos;s very confusing .
how are the kids ?
great . jackie , actually ...
i wanted to invite you to a party .
a party ?
really ?
yes .
um , this friday .
for my law firm ; it &apos;s a holiday party .
oh , well ,
i &apos;m honored , alicia ,
but peter and i have dinner plans .
i invited peter , too .
i would love it if you both could come .
how wonderful !
thank you , alicia .
holiday decorations , jackie .
not christmas , not jesus .
holiday .
i have a hanukkah , too .
so ...
you &apos;re following me .
yeah .
will was worried why i was at florrick @-@ agos .
i explained to him that i was there negotiating
alicia florrick &apos;s exit package .
good to know .
maybe i can help you .
what do you need to know ?
how involved you are with your old clients .
i &apos;m not involved .
they &apos;re criminals , and i &apos;m a lawyer .
of course .
thanks .
check out the highlighted name .
what &apos;s this ?
this is the guest list for alicia florrick &apos;s party .
the one peter is attending .
&quot; colin sweeney ... &quot;
who ... oh !
yes .
the wife @-@ killer .
the white o.j.
one of alicia &apos;s clients .
well , you should tell peter .
i did .
he &apos;s still going .
oh , that &apos;s unfortunate .
marilyn , you need to tell him
it &apos;s an ethics issue .
it &apos;s not an ethics issue , it &apos;s a publicity issue .
that &apos;s not my business .
but it &apos;s your business that ...
what is that ?
it &apos;s a pregnancy sound system .
it soothes the baby .
the baby has to listen to that all day ?
eli , there are no ethical issues here .
wait . when peter was state &apos;s attorney ,
he offered sweeney a deal ...
early release in return for wearing a wire .
that &apos;s an ethics violation .
okay , but it &apos;s too late to change peter &apos;s mind .
once he says &quot; no , &quot; he doesn &apos;t reverse himself .
then what ?
alicia .
okay , this seems to be a matter of two wills .
yes , your honor . our client , lila ashbaugh ,
is the true beneficiary of her husband &apos;s estate ...
not after a second will was discovered
in a safety deposit box , your honor .
a will , we believe , is invalid ,
and we ask for emergency relief .
this second will was drawn up one year later ,
and 16 months before mr. ashbaugh died .
yes , but it was drawn up in magic marker .
it could be drawn up in crayon . it &apos;s still valid ...
could have been , but it was drawn up in magic marker ...
you should know that . it &apos;s still valid , mr. gardner .
ladies , gentlemen , yes , i know.i know .
other judges let their lawyers run
free and wild , but in my court ,
my probate court , where i have been assigned ,
you will bridle yourselves .
now , one will bequeaths the $ 24 million
in personal property to mrs. ashbaugh .
and the other will ...
the later will .
the other will ,
uh , bequeaths the assets
to the smile train charity and ...
alicia florrick .
well , hello , ms. florrick .
your honor .
it seems to be your lucky day .
the wife of a governor
and a $ 12 million inheritance .
well , it &apos;s an odd day anyway .
now , it seems to be our duty to decide
which will is valid , is that correct ?
yes , your honor , and to that end , we have a witness .
paula gidfar .
i was the witness to matty &apos;s will .
matty ?
as in matthew ashbaugh ?
yes , matthew .
hmm . and this is your signature on the will
with a little happy face over the &quot; i &quot; ?
written in magic marker ?
yes .
it &apos;s all that we had .
um , just before matthew left , we couldn &apos;t find a pen .
do you work as a notary , miss gidfar ?
do i ?
no .
are you in the legal profession ?
uh @-@ uh .
the reason i ask is , mr. ashbaugh seemed to trust you
with the witnessing of such an important document .
your honor , we would concede that miss gidfar works
in the sex trade as an escort .
oh , no . he &apos;s ruined my presentation .
and we would also agree that her profession
doesn &apos;t matter , because it &apos;s still ...
blah , blah , blah . do you mind ... ?
it &apos;s an associate of mine .
really ?
what kind of associate ?
why , are you jealous ?
heart @-@ stricken .
paula &apos;s a very close associate ,
very talented .
and she reviews all your ... contracts ?
and how much did matty pay you
for the night in question , miss gidfar ?
$ 5,000 .
and what does $ 5,000 buy ?
do we really need to go there , counselor ?
there is a point , your honor .
miss gidfar ?
$ 5,000 ?
it buys you the 9 : 00 to 9 : 00 ...
9 : : 00 p.m. to 9 : 00 a.m. , anything you want .
anything meaning sexually , but not just sexually ?
yes . uh ,
some men want to cry all night and be held .
some want dinner dates , some breakfast , you know .
matty
wanted a signature .
well , that and an enema .
yes , thank you .
your honor ,
a paid witness is an invalid witness ,
and miss gidfar was obviously paid .
for sex .
no , no , for everything .
she just said $ 5,000 covers everything ,
including the witnessing of this will .
ergo she was paid .
ergo @-@ ergo this will is invalid . thank you .
you cross .
what ?
you handle the cross .
counselors , anything , or should we move on ?
good , counselor .
we &apos;re ready for you .
counselor ?
yes . i ...
this , uh , all @-@ service contract with mr. ashbaugh ...
could you speak up , counselor ?
this all @-@ service contract ... - too loud .
have you usually contracted
in this manner with mr. ashbaugh ?
in what manner ? you mean , the all @-@ nighter ?
yes .
yes .
yes .
oh , good . &quot; yes . &quot;
and have you witnessed other contracts for mr. ashbaugh ?
have i ?
oh , a few , yes .
i see .
uh , did you , uh , witness
the lockhart @-@ gardner retainer agreement ?
come on , your honor . this isn &apos;t about our retainer agreement .
this is about a will .
is that an objection ?
yeah , it is . objection .
uh , counselor ,
do you have a counterargument ?
yes , i do . i very much do ,
your honor .
it is , uh , an argument about ...
many things .
oh . specifically , if @-@ if this will is invalid ,
then the identically witnessed
lockhart @-@ gardner retainer agreement is invalid , too .
i think that &apos;s probably true ,
but you &apos;re still left with an invalid will .
anything further , counselor ?
actually , your honor , uh , just one brief thought .
if you &apos;ll indulge me .
i will .
miss ...
sorry , i forgot your name .
gidfar .
okay .
you testified earlier that you ...
just before mr. ashbaugh left ,
he had trouble finding a pen ?
yes .
and what time did he leave ?
nine thirty . he had to get to work .
and he had contracted you for a &quot; 9 : 00 @-@ to @-@ 9 : 00 , &quot; you said ?
yeah . $ 5,000 .
so your service to him was over at 9 : 00 a.m. ?
oh , yes . oh , i see where you &apos;re going .
what time did you witness the contract ?
after nine .
so you were not being paid
under his all @-@ service contract at that point ?
that &apos;s right ,
i wasn &apos;t .
and so i wasn &apos;t being paid to witness his will .
thank you , ma &apos;am .
oh . uh , nothing further , your honor .
having fun ?
i thought you were gonna go fast .
want to try the highway ?
it &apos;s up to you . i &apos;m just your tail .
when i lose you , just , you know ,
give me a call , and i &apos;ll slow down , all right ?
kalinda , you need to go out with me .
sure . when ?
no , i &apos;m serious . just the two of us .
me mom loves the indians .
what makes you think i &apos;m indian ?
okay , the highway &apos;s just ahead of you . ready ?
oh , no , kalinda ...
you &apos;re driving too fast , love .
going a little fast there , aren &apos;t you , speed racer ?
detective , i &apos;m a licensed private investigator
in pursuit of a suspect .
really ? what suspect ?
hi @-@ ya , jenna , how &apos;s it going ?
damian , you were right , she was following you .
yeah . but don &apos;t go too hard on her .
she meant well .
ma &apos;am , please step out of the car .
come on .
what ? 90 miles in a 45 zone ?
it &apos;s reckless driving ,
aggravated fleeing of a peace officer .
it &apos;s a felony . get out of the car ; you &apos;re under arrest .
hello , i &apos;m here for my daughter , alicia florrick .
hi . uh , she &apos;s at court right now ,
but she should be back in about an hour .
oh . excuse me .
hello .
oh , veronica , how are you ?
it &apos;s jackie .
oh , yes . jackie .
how are you ?
oh , i &apos;m very well , thank you .
i &apos;m at peter &apos;s governor &apos;s offices ,
and they &apos;re very impressive .
i &apos;m glad . what do you need , jackie ?
well , i was just wondering
when you &apos;ll be at alicia &apos;s party .
i was hoping to meet up with you there .
you know , the holiday party on friday
at alicia &apos;s new firm .
veronica ?
according to its date , this will was
drawn up 16 months prior to your husband &apos;s death .
could you comment on your husband &apos;s mental state at that time ?
objection . improper expert opinion .
sustained .
was your husband having difficulty at baugh tech ,
the company he formed ?
he was .
the new york board was attempting
to have him removed for cause .
and what was that cause ?
mental incapacity .
my husband was being deposed
by the board for acting erratically .
that &apos;s why we need to prep you for your deposition tomorrow .
it &apos;s power .
what is power , sir ?
insanity .
so you &apos;re saying your eccentricity is a put @-@ on ?
yes .
throwing off the equilibrium of your opponent .
i have a saying over my desk :
&quot; play the fox . play the fox . &quot;
and your husband never expressed any interest in drafting a new will ?
that is correct .
nothing further , your honor .
just a few questions .
mr. hayden , one thing .
what do they have ?
something from the weekend we were out there with ashbaugh .
what did your husband have written over his desk ?
what ?
your husband had a motto written over his desk .
do you recall what does this motto say ?
and if so , did your husband always ...
it &apos;s power .
so you &apos;re saying your eccentricity is a put @-@ on ?
yes .
throwing off your opponent &apos;s equilibrium .
i have a saying over my desk :
&quot; always play the fox .
they &apos;ll never know you &apos;re the sanest man in the room . &quot;
did your husband often pretend to be crazy
to throw off his opponents ?
not back then , no .
not when he was writing up this stupid will .
and did your husband &apos;s board of directors rule that
your husband was of unsound mind ?
no .
nothing further , your honor .
okay , i am ready to rule .
we lost .
given that we have
conflicting testimony regarding
mr. ashbaugh &apos;s sanity ...
lack of testamentary capacity is
a well @-@ recognized basis for invalidate ...
... therefore i have no choice but to consider
both wills valid , given the laws of illinois ...
your honor , um ... before you rule ,
we have another witness we &apos;d like to call .
i have ruled that mr. ashbaugh was of sound mind .
yes , and we accept your ruling ,
but there is the matter of undue influence .
undue influence on the deceased ?
yes , we contend he was encouraged to draw up a new will
by his lawyer , alicia florrick .
your honor , this is offensive .
we ask for a leave of the court to question mrs. florrick .
you have already ruled , your honor !
your honor , this is for emergency relief .
this is ridiculous ...
it is
within our rights to call another witness ...
that &apos;s enough !
it &apos;s almost 5 : 00 now .
we will take this up tomorrow morning
with your new witness .
what does he got ?
a whole lot of anger .
mr. gardner will argue you seduced mr. ashbaugh .
yes .
are you ready for it ?
i will be .
oh , thank god you &apos;re here .
what now ?
we got some more rsvps .
good . how many ?
835 .
i &apos;m sorry , did you just say ... ?
yeah , 835 people said yes .
we can &apos;t fit 835 people
in our offices .
i know .
you sent out a press release about peter ?
no , we @-@ we sent out an e @-@ mail alert
to our invitees , that &apos;s all .
cary ?
when did we stop acting together ?
we are acting together .
as soon as i agree to call peter ,
you &apos;re sending him an e @-@ mail .
as soon as i ...
the party &apos;s tomorrow night .
then come to me .
what did i do to you ?
did i hurt you in some way ?
mom , what are you talking about ?
you invited jackie ?
not me , your own mother ?
mom , it &apos;s not a real party .
it &apos;s a business party .
jackie calls me out of the blue and lords it over me .
and i &apos;m just standing there like an idiot .
&quot; what party ? &quot;
alicia , do you have a minute ?
mom , it was an oversight .
i meant to ask you tonight to come .
you were ? you &apos;re sure ?
you &apos;re not just saying that ?
i am not just saying that .
would you come to the party tomorrow night ?
can i bring someone ?
sure .
that would be great .
i know exactly what i &apos;m gonna wear .
i bought it last week .
okay , mom , i &apos;m gonna get back to work now .
alicia .
we have a small issue .
of course . is it about the holiday party ?
yes . how did you know ?
alicia , we can &apos;t let peter be in the same room
as colin sweeney .
it &apos;s not just
that mr. sweeney has an unseemly past .
it &apos;s an ethical question .
it might seem like a quid pro quo for his plea bargain .
what ?
do you hear that ?
it &apos;s my pregnancy sound system .
it soothes the baby .
he doesn &apos;t like chopin very much ,
but he really , really ...
alicia , will you speak to sweeney ?
no .
you won &apos;t ? why not ?
because i won &apos;t disinvite a client .
alicia , this is not a small issue .
i know . you should tell peter .
and my guess is you already told peter
and he &apos;s coming anyway .
but i &apos;m not disinviting a guest .
so , uh , what &apos;s the plan ?
my plan ?
reading .
for how long ?
see that bus back there ?
takes arrestees to court for their bond hearings .
and you &apos;re waiting till it leaves ?
yup .
so i &apos;m gonna be stuck in holding overnight ?
yup .
because damian asked you to ?
yup .
why ?
because i owe him .
what do you owe him ?
wow . you can &apos;t turn it off , can you ?
just stop being an investigator for , like , ten minutes .
will that help me ?
sure .
okay .
charm me .
what ?
you want out of your cuffs ? turn on the charm .
i don &apos;t do charm .
okay , then sit tight .
what do you call a boomerang that doesn &apos;t come back ?
what ?
a stick .
mrs. florrick ,
how long have you been mr. ashbaugh &apos;s attorney ?
around two years .
right up until his death .
and in all that time ,
did mr. ashbaugh ever threaten to fire you as his attorney ?
no , not to my knowledge .
really ?
are you certain of that ?
i &apos;m not certain of anything .
but if mr. gardner has something more specific
he &apos;d like to ask .
and in all that time ,
did mr. ashbaugh ever threaten to fire you as his attorney ?
no , i mean ...
are you talking about the thing two years ago ?
yes , the &quot; thing &quot; two years ago .
tell me about this ...
did mr. ashbaugh express worries about your representation
in a meeting in his new york apartment
on september 23 , 2011 ?
they &apos;re out to get me .
matthew , if you say that in this deposition , it will sound crazy .
if i don &apos;t say in this deposition ,
then they &apos;ll get away with it .
i have enemies .
yes , and your enemies will cheer if you say this .
trust me , matthew , please .
stop saying my name like that .
i &apos;m not 12 years old .
yes , sir , i ...
matthew .
listen to me .
you &apos;re a smart man whose words are easily twisted .
people don &apos;t see as deeply as you do .
and they &apos;ll use the surface of your words ...
stop it , alicia .
are you married or aren &apos;t you ?
are you married , alicia ?
and after he asked you that , did he threaten to fire you ?
yes .
and why did he threaten that ?
i don &apos;t know .
but later that night , didn &apos;t you say
that mr. ashbaugh was in love with you ?
do you want me to repeat the question ?
no .
i was joking when i said that .
you were joking that mr. ashbaugh was
in love with you and would do anything you asked ?
you &apos;re saying that was a joke ?
don &apos;t worry , i can get him to change his mind .
how ?
he cares about me .
you &apos;ve got him wrapped around your finger , is that it ?
i have my ways .
this is crazy romantic .
this is the happiest i &apos;ve ever been .
mrs. florrick , you knew he was in love with you ,
and you used it to get your way ?
may i remind you that you are under oath ?
i didn &apos;t intentionally use him .
not intentionally ? i see .
so it &apos;s just the way you are with men ?
no .
i cared for him . i liked him .
and so it was all right to use him ?
you make things sound so simple .
i &apos;m married .
you always use that , don &apos;t you ?
&quot; married . &quot;
you &apos;re conveniently married when you want to be .
that &apos;s not fair .
i loved you .
you made me believe that
so that you could steal my clients .
no .
will .
you stop it !
i don &apos;t like it when you &apos;re weak .
come back to bed .
you &apos;re working too hard .
and i have a tough witness tomorrow .
let it go .
i &apos;m here now .
good news . donna brazile wants to meet .
why ?
why do you think ?
2016 .
no .
yes .
peter , it &apos;s not just the presidency they &apos;re looking for .
it &apos;s the vice presidency .
biden won &apos;t be hillary &apos;s .
hillary won &apos;t be biden &apos;s .
they &apos;re looking for new talent .
or a stalking horse .
so ? the horse goes lame .
the stalking horse becomes the horse .
who &apos;s the horse ?
i don &apos;t know , whatever you meant .
the point is , she wants to meet .
great . when ?
that &apos;s the problem .
she &apos;s in town this friday .
during alicia &apos;s party .
eli , you know that i want ...
i know . i know . but she &apos;ll understand .
alicia will understand .
this is about your future , peter .
you &apos;re not trying to pull something over on me , are you ?
yes , i &apos;m arranging a meeting with donna brazile
to keep you from going to alicia &apos;s party .
that makes sense .

no , i &apos;ll do it .
used to be a beat cop ?
uh , yeah .
for five years .
still got the holster scars ?
both hips .
you like your bersa ?

yeah .
it &apos;s light .
it &apos;s like a kid &apos;s toy .
you should try the smith &amp; wesson m &amp; p.
same size .
mmm , i never liked the grip .
you want to find out about damian , don &apos;t you ?
that &apos;s why you &apos;re here .
yeah .
it &apos;s too bad i like damian more than i like you .
well , wait till you get to know me better .
no , no . alicia , i &apos;m very excited to come to your holiday party .
jackie , i &apos;m heading into court right now .
what can i help you with ?
well , i was talking to your mother ,
and she said she was bringing a guest ,
and i would love to bring a friend .
let me take it .
no , i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m good .
good morning , mrs. florrick .
good morning to you .
how long have you been mr. ashbaugh &apos;s attorney ?
oh , about two years .
and did mr. ashbaugh ever threaten to fire you
as his attorney over those two years ?
yes .
and when was this ?
september 23 , 2011 .
could you explain the circumstances ?
yes .
you and i were at his apartment in new york city
prepping him for his testimony .
and was there anything about that night ...
actually , i wasn &apos;t finished .
do you want me to finish ?
please .
he was being removed from the board of one of the companies
he had created .
mr. ashbaugh thought that he should be allowed to testify
to some of the concerns he had over the board members .
we argued that was not essential to the facts .
and did you change his mind ?
yes , i did .
and did you claim that mr. ashbaugh was in love with you ?
mrs. florrick ?
i did claim that .
and did you suggest that you ...
could use his love to ...
manipulate him ?
i said it was a possibility .
and did you manipulate him into signing off on his will ?
yes .
your honor . may i have a minute to consult with my client ?
no , counselor .
i think she &apos;s doing fine .
continue .
and this manipulation ,
in your opinion , did it constitute undue influence ?
unfortunately , i think it did .
and was there anyone else involved with this manipulation ?
yes .
there was ?
who ?
david lee .
david lee was involved with this will ?
no .
the other one .
thank you , mrs. florrick .
whoa , wait a minute . i don &apos;t think mrs. florrick was finished .
no , i don &apos;t think she was , either .
what @-@ what do you mean by &quot; the other one &quot; ?
do you mean the other will ?
yes . david lee is lockhart @-@ gardner &apos;s lawyer
in family law .
he asked me to use my influence with mr. ashbaugh
to get him to sign this will .
you mean the will benefitting mrs. ashbaugh .
yes .
mr. ashbaugh was delaying .
mr. lee asked me to ...
&quot; prime the pump , &quot; i believe were his words .
okay .
anything further , counselor ?
not for the moment .
it &apos;s good to see you again , donna .
you know , eli thinks that this is about 2016 .
is he right ?
well , he &apos;s partially right .
we &apos;re gonna see who &apos;s suiting up
and who &apos;s sitting on the sidelines .
well , we &apos;re ...
w @-@ would you like us to be suiting up ?
well , it depends . would you consider ?
oh . excuse me .
go ahead , take it .
it &apos;s my mom .
well , now you have to take it .
no . no , he really doesn &apos;t .
come on . it &apos;s his mom , eli .
thanks , donna .
hi , mom .
uh ... no , i &apos;m sorry , i can &apos;t make it . i &apos;m in a meeting .
sorry . yeah .
all right . good @-@ bye .
do you have to be someplace ?
no . no , we &apos;re just ...
actually , yes .
my wife &apos;s party .
but i &apos;ve occupied your time .
donna ...
do you want to go to a party ?
those are magical words .
hello ?
i can &apos;t hear you . hello ?
yes , alicia .
alicia , we &apos;re ... we &apos;re coming now .
to your party .
eli ?
yes . we are coming to your party .
peter and ... donna brazile .
did ... did you just say donna brazile
is coming to my party ?
yes . yes , i know . we have lost all shreds of sanity .
but i just wanted to know ...
please , god ... is colin sweeney there ?
be of good cheer , eli .
colin sweeney couldn &apos;t make it .
his flight got delayed in san francisco .
oh , thank god !
thank your christian jesus god .
merry christmas , eli .
so , are we millionaires yet ?
only in the love we have for each other .
can we buy anything with that ?
well , you can always ...
what ?
eli &apos;s not gonna be happy .
why ? who is it ?
an old client .
lemond bishop .
the top drug dealer in chicago .
sometimes i think of you as mom ,
and other times just as this interesting person
who lives at our house .
be right back .
excuse me .
cary !
what &apos;s lemond bishop doing here ?
oh , he came ? that &apos;s great . where ?
you invited him ?
no , i did .
i thought you wanted him as a client .
oh , god .
because we don &apos;t actually have
a national religion in america , jackie .
that should have no impact on office decorations .
out of sensitivity .
veronica , i don &apos;t want to offend you ,
but you really should think about drinking less .
oh , really ? why is that ?
cause you &apos;re raising your voice .
well , maybe you should drink a little more ,
and that might kill that bug up your ass .
could you deal with that ?
thanks .
florrick @-@ agos &amp; associates .
oh . i expected to get cary .
i &apos;ll have him call you back .
no , that &apos;s all right .
uh , there &apos;s been a ...
something &apos;s happened .
we discovered another safety @-@ deposit box
belonging to mr. ashbaugh .
okay .
there were four more wills in it ,
leaving all his money to four other women .
this seems to be something ashbaugh does .
did .
so it looks like all five will be found invalid .
anything else ?
no .
well , thanks for calling .
you &apos;re welcome .
happy holidays .
i usually vote republican ,
but i couldn &apos;t resist voting for you .
yeah , uh , here , let &apos;s find alicia . donna ...
i @-@ i would love some time to talk to you , sir .
about some charity ideas .
sounds good .
hey , cary , congratulations .
is that who i think it was ?
yeah , just keep moving .
donna , i &apos;d like you to meet alicia .
lemond freaking bishop ?
it was news to me , too , eli .
this is terrific .
thank you for coming .
donna , i &apos;d like you to meet my wife alicia .
pleasure to meet you .
likewise . thank you so much for coming .
