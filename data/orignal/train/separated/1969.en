I love you.
I love everything about you.
I get to change lives! That's the dream!
Fine, I don't want to go to Africa.
I found out that I'm pregnant with Mark's baby.
Are you in or are you out?
I'm in.
Oh, my God!
Callie! Callie!
I choose you to be the one with whom I spend my life.
I can't keep doing this alone, Arizona.
I thought we were past the hard stuff.
We have a child!
I know!
How could you do this? I don't want to fix us anymore.
This is Penny.
Callie's moving to New York.
And she's trying to take Sofia with her.
You hired a lawyer.
You started this.
There's this Bible story.
Two women both claim to be the mother of the same child.
My client is prepared to offer scheduled visitation
every other weekend.
King Solomon had to choose.
That is ridiculous, and she knows it.
Sofia cannot take a six-hour flight by herself twice a month.
That would be a hard no.
Hold, please.
Two mothers. Only one gets the kid.
We knew they'd shoot that down.
They are shooting everything down
because they're being unreasonable.
They have the luxury of being unreasonable right now.
We have less than 12 hours to try to settle.
Their witness lineup is better, and they know it.
We have Richard Webber.
Ok--
Maybe we should put April on the stand.
Kepner? No.
We're not calling a witness you just fired as a patient.
But she's seen me with Sofia more than anyone,
and she's a good person. She'll tell the truth.
No, she's a wild card. It's too risky.
Webber's good.
He better be.
What is your client prepared to offer as an alternative?
Solomon came up with a plan. He proposed a 50/50 split.
Visitation rights for Dr. Robbins
on school breaks and summers.
That puts us right back where we started.
Literally. He offered to chop the kid in half.
It's a reasonable compromise.
Yeah, well, you can take your compromise
and shove it up your -- - Oh, no. You know what?
You can --
Arizona, look at me.
We are at an impasse here.
If we don't settle, if we go to trial,
you risk losing it all.
Only one of you is walking out of that court
with sole custody.
I am painfully aware of that.
Then I urge you to consider their offer.
Their offer is insulting.
And last time I checked, you work for me.
That would be a hard no.
Hold.
It all ends if one mom relinquishes her custody.
Gamble.
We're here.
Or else they both stand their ground.
We'll see you in court.
And the kid gets torn apart.
Hi, Sofia!
Mer will be down in a second.
I'm so sorry about this.
Please. It's the best way to spend a day off.
I'm thinking pancakes for breakfast.
With chocolate chips?
Crazytown!
Let's do it.
Does, Sofia know anything about
what her mommies are doing today?
Nope.
We're gonna talk to her after we know exactly what's happening.
You ready?
Come here.
Come here. I'm gonna miss you so much.
You know what?
Mama loves you so, so much.
I will see you again before you know it.
I know.
You're hugging me too tight.
You're hugging me too long.
Callie, we have to go. We don't want to be late.
Come on. Come on.
Come on. Come on.
Okay.
Let's go find Zola!
She's gonna be fine.
She's with Maggie. Okay, come on.
Come on.
It's gonna be okay.
This one is deeper than I would like.
I'll stitch it up. You have to go.
Is the baby okay?
Let's take a look.
Jenny?
Tara.
I heard you fell.
On some dishes.
I was washing them and got soapy water all over the floor.
Then I slipped.
I told her I would do them later.
She's nesting, I think.
Mom, cut it out.
There is the baby's heartbeat -- nice and steady --
and the baby's active, which is exactly what you want.
I fell really hard. Are you sure?
The baby looks great,
but I see some free fluid in your abdomen.
It might be bleeding. Or amniotic fluid.
Jenny, I'm gonna have to take you up and have a look.
Surgery?
No.
No surgery. I don't want to go through that again.
It's nothing. I'm gonna make a small incision,
put a scope in there, make sure everything's all right.
You'll be there, right?
I'm -- I'm sorry.
Actually, I wish I could. Today I can't.
Dr. Russo will monitor the baby.
He's the OB on call, and he's great.
I will be there, though. I'm happy to.
Don't you need to get going?
Yeah. I will check in later.
Russo's good, but he can be a little old-school,
just so you know.
All right. Go.
Okay.
I can't believe you dumped Kyle with a note.
Brutal.
Yeah, not my finest moment.
That's like dumping someone by text, only in 1980.
Remind me why you broke up with him at all?
You know why.
I know.
It's just that he's so hot
and he's into you and he plays guitar,
and he's sick, so you always know where he is.
I know. You had to choose between doctor and girlfriend.
You made the right choice.
Thank you.
However, there are countless other brains to cut into
but a limited number of butts like his.
Keep your eyes on your own butt.
Well, I, uh, ground the beans myself.
Thanks. Let's go.
Wait, wait.
We have a few minutes.
How you feeling?
Robbins.
It'll be tough, but right now, you have to look past the pain
to what you'll have when they're done.
"At the end, you'll have a baby."
That's what I tell all the laboring moms.
You're not drinking.
Okay.
We're here today to determine
a custody modification of a minor
between two divorced parents,
Arizona Robbins and Calliope Torres.
The trial's witness pool is unusual
in that it'll be shared by both parents.
The parties have stipulated to call each witness once,
at which time,
each side will have a chance to examine that witness.
If you're testifying, remember --
this is not a popularity contest.
You are not choosing sides.
We're all on the same side --
the side of a 6-year-old child.
Dr. Torres, Dr. Robbins,
custody hearings are, without exception,
very difficult on all parties involved,
your daughter included.
Things said here will undoubtedly be harsh
and cannot be unsaid.
I ask this of parents before I begin any custody hearing.
Are you both sure you want to proceed?
Yes, Your Honor. I'm sure.
Dr. Torres.
I'm sure, Your Honor.
Then this court is now in session
to determine sole physical custody
of Sofia Robbin Sloan Torres.
Torres and I worked together on a pro bono project
building prosthetics for injured vets.
And that's a very meaningful project for you
because you're a vet yourself.
Is that correct?
Yes, I served as a surgeon in the Army.
Charity work and the vet card.
That's smart.
Yeah, it's not good for Robbins.
What was the connection for Dr. Torres?
Well, she just cares.
While she didn't serve,
she's always been willing to pitch in, to help.
She's a very empathetic person.
Big-hearted.
Has Dr. Torres discussed her move to New York with you?
She has.
Did you feel it was a sudden move?
Um, well, not for her. I mean, it was sudden
because Dr. Blake's schedule determined the move,
but for Callie, no.
This is who she is.
She gets thrown a situation -- it doesn't daunt her.
It inspires her.
I've seen it time and time again in the O.R.
She just jumps in.
And this is no different.
She's found a great school for Sofia,
and she's making the best of a tough situation with grace.
It's something I admire about her.
No further questions at this time.
You live with Dr. Robbins, don't you?
I rent a room in her house.
I bet you never expected to be living with a 6-year-old.
Yeah, sure. I wasn't, uh, thrilled
to be living with a kid, uh,
till I started living with one.
I had never been around a lot of kids before,
but Sofia's a blast.
She's so smart and hilarious.
I mean, she and her mom are just laughing all the time.
The place is so happy.
Sofia makes the place happy.
We see so much dark stuff every day at work.
It's -- It's really nice to come home to a happy kid.
So, would you say you love Sofia?
I -- I have come to. Yes.
Oh, that's nice.
And how long have you known Sofia now?
Well, we met a few months ago.
Oh, and how well would you say you've gotten to know Sofia
in the few months that you've spent together, Dr. Blake?
Very well.
Very well. That's good.
That's, uh, very good.
What's her favorite color?
Blue.
Her favorite toy?
Objection. Irrelevant. This isn't a quiz show.
I'm trying to establish the nature
of Dr. Blake's relationship with Sofia.
I'll allow it.
Her favorite toy is Astronaut Barbie.
Her favorite cereal is Whole Grain O's.
Her favorite animal is a unicorn.
Her favorite sea creature is a mermaid.
And her bedtime is 8:30.
And her favorite thing to do in the morning
is pick out her outfit.
You can ask me anything you want.
5mm scope.
So, why aren't you there?
In court?
Why aren't you there?
I've seen enough people fighting over kids.
I've had enough of fighting over my own,
and mine's not even born yet.
Well, there's the free fluid.
Suction irrigator, please.
How are we looking here, Dr. Karev?
Uh, well, that's not blood.
Oh, no.
Looks like amniotic fluid.
Show me the uterine fundus, please.
Damn it. Uterus is perforated.
Let me have a look there.
Thank you.
Getting fluid in her abdomen.
This pregnancy has just become non-viable.
This baby's barely viable outside that womb.
It's only 24 weeks.
You can repair it, can't you?
I can try.
Throw in a plasma patch, hope for the best.
"Hope for the best?"
It's experimental,
but if we want to prolong this pregnancy --
Of course we do.
Then a patch is the way to go.
Five seconds ago, you wanted to deliver.
Now you're confident in a plasma patch?
Dr. Karev, I am the OB on call here.
You are a peds surgeon.
If I say that a patch is best, a patch is best.
Kepner?
If it keeps the baby in,
I vote for the patch.
Stay in your lane, Dr. Karev.
Prep albumin polymers, please.
I'll update the mom.
How'd it go? How's Jenny?
Well, she's still in surgery but doing great.
We located the source of the leak,
and Dr. Russo's repairing it right now.
And the baby?
The baby is healthy and still in utero,
which is what we want.
It's too little to be born, right?
It wouldn't be ideal.
I-I need you to sign one more form
for Dr. Russo's repair.
It seems like I was just here
signing these for Jenny's last surgery.
I just had a feeling.
I said goodbye.
I left for work.
I was two blocks away
and I had an awful, just sick feeling.
I turned around, I drove home, and there she was --
on the floor, blood everywhere.
I just had a terrible feeling
that something was really wrong.
It's a good thing you did.
And your work schedule will be pretty grueling, I'd imagine.
Actually, it's a research fellowship,
so it will be far more predictable
than a surgery resident's schedule.
Oh, I see.
What was Sofia wearing this morning?
What?
What was she wearing today?
I -- I don't know.
You didn't see her this morning?
No, I-I did.
I just, uh --
I can't, um, recall exactly what it --
Objection. Relevance.
Moving on.
What grade is Sofia in?
Second.
No, first.
She's in first grade.
I have to go, and this is getting hard to watch.
Are you sure?
Yes.
Because you didn't sound sure,
and you keep saying this is a child that you know,
a child that you're gonna soon co-parent.
I-I-I can see - how you might not remember...
...what color tutu she wore to school today,
but to not even know what grade she's in --
So many objections.
Badgering, irrelevant --
Sustained.
I'm sorry.
I don't mean to belabor the point,
but you said it yourself.
You've only known Sofia a few months, so --
No, that is not what I meant.
But that is what you said.
All right, Counselor.
I know what grade she's in.
I do.
I do.
No further questions, Your Honor.
Maybe it wasn't that bad.
That was really, really bad.
Oh, God.
But it doesn't kill us. Not yet.
I can't believe Arizona let them pull that slimy bull--
It was a smart move, and it worked.
But we've got smarter moves.
Let me put Dr. Grey on the stand tomorrow,
and she's gonna close strong.
Look confident.
You're the Chief of Surgery.
Doctors Torres and Robbins report to you.
That is correct.
And for those of us who aren't surgeons,
Dr. Torres operates on bones
while Dr. Robbins operates on babies.
Is that correct?
Well, fetuses and babies. Yes.
How does the schedule of an orthopedic surgeon
compare to that of a fetal surgeon?
It varies day to day.
I see, but in your opinion,
which specialty has more unscheduled surgeries?
Ortho or fetal?
There's really no comparison.
But Dr. Robbins' schedule is dictated
by the unpredictable nature of childbirth, is it not?
Objection. Speculation.
She can't do that.
You can't do that.
I asked if Dr. Robbins' schedule
is dictated by the unpredictable nature of childbirth.
Objection. Speculation.
Your Honor, I'm asking an expert witness her opinion.
It's only speculation if counsel is calling into question
the expertise of this witness as Chief.
Overruled. Counselor, proceed.
Dr. Robbins' schedule is unpredictable,
wouldn't you say?
It can be, yes. Any surgeon's --
Sure, but how many unscheduled emergency procedures
did Dr. Robbins log over the past six months?
I have no idea.
I would like to introduce into evidence Document 2C.
Take a look. This might refresh your memory.
What is that report, Doctor?
This is a list of - emergency procedures performed
by Dr. Robbins and Dr. Torres for the past six months.
And according to that document,
how many emergency procedures
did Dr. Torres log in the past six months?
27.
27.
And how many did Dr. Robbins log?
92.
92.
Now, even for a surgeon,
wouldn't you call that kind of schedule grueling?
You can say that. I wouldn't.
I would say it's wildly successful,
but then, I would never put
a woman's success in the con column.
What about her daughter, though?
92.
92 times she dropped everything,
Sofia included, to go to a job.
Would you ask that if she were a man?
92 times she chose work over her child.
Your Honor --
92 times Dr. Robbins was saving babies,
saving parents from losing their own children!
No further questions.
Don't get discouraged.
They're trying to turn your strength into weakness.
This court is adjourned until tomorrow.
No, over here.
Right up against the bed.
God, Mom. Just go home to sleep.
This is so embarrassing.
I'm sorry. She's a nightmare.
That's right. I'm everybody's nightmare.
Can I have another blanket, please?
Sure.
How's everyone feeling?
I hear you're sleeping over tonight.
Thank God you're back.
She's nicer to me when you're around.
Surgery went well?
Yeah. Russo did a plasma patch.
Yeah, that's a good call.
This baby needs more time.
Okay, listen. I'm sorry that I wasn't here for the surgery,
but I'll be checking in later, okay?
I told you. Kepner and I have Jenny handled.
She's doing fine. The baby's good.
Everyone's stable.
Um, where's Russo?
I need to look at a post-op ultrasound
to make sure the leak is sealed.
Should you be here?
Shouldn't you be at home getting ready for court or something?
No. I shouldn't be here.
I should be at home fixing my daughter ice cream
and reading her "Charlotte's Web."
So could you please page Russo
so I can look at the ultrasounds
and get the hell out of here?
Okay.
Thank you.
It's an impossible situation.
A break-up is tough enough as it is,
but with a kid in the mix...
I can't even imagine.
I mean, just because you're not
the parent who gave birth to the kid
doesn't make the kid any less yours.
Biology or not,
no parent ever fought to stick around for me.
It was a horrible mistake.
The custody battle?
Me breaking up with Kyle.
I told you that.
Who's Kyle?
He was a once-in-a-lifetime butt.
I said that, too.
I'm calling him.
Mm, the -- the drunk-dial.
It's a bad idea.
I'm not drunk.
Steph, look at me.
You have 10 more seconds to talk about him,
and then no more Kyle talk.
I said that to you.
I know.
10, 9...
Shut up. I'm calling him.
And it is not drunk-dialing, sir.
It is me undoing my mistake.
Okay. - I --
Give it back.
No.
You are a good friend.
I know.
So, what were you thinking?
Okay, um...
When the baby's born --
Starting Day 1, huh?
I would like to be in the room for the birth.
Um, so if that makes you uncomfortable --
No, not at all.
Really?
Yeah.
Yeah, I want you there.
Okay. Um...
Well, when the baby's on a feeding schedule,
whenever that happens, then I'm thinking weekends?
You don't want to split the week?
I do. Yes.
But when the baby's older,
we may need to switch to every other week.
I've read that that is just -- - Easier on the child.
Yeah, I-I read that, too.
But I want Easter.
It's important to me.
I go to church, and you -- - Worship the Easter Bunny.
Right.
Now, are we talking Easter egg hunts
or just church?
Yeah, of course there will be an Easter egg hunt.
All right, then Easter's all yours.
Uh, and you can have the Super Bowl and Halloween.
Mm. Sure.
Okay, now, what about, uh, Christmas?
We switch off.
We switch off. We, uh, make a plan.
We respect the plan.
We don't fight.
Yeah, we don't fight.
Okay, sweetie.
Yeah, no, it's past your bedtime.
Okay. Hey.
I love you.
Okay. No, no, no.
No, I don't want to talk to Mommy, okay?
Okay, bye --
I feel gross.
I feel gross. Court covered me in a layer of gross
no amount of wine can wash away.
Tequila?
Mnh-mnh.
You know, you don't have to stay.
I'll be fine alone till Penny gets home.
Oh. That won't be for hours.
I buried her in scut and post-ops.
I'll call you a cab.
Go home and see your kids.
My kids are asleep.
They're with Maggie and Amelia.
What if last night was our last night?
Stop. Don't do that.
I am doing this all wrong.
Mark used to say that.
You know...
...when the kids were babies,
he used to call me all the time when Sofia would cry
or she got soap in her eye
and he didn't know what to do.
He called you? He had two moms!
Yeah, but the two of you were so on top of it,
he didn't want you to know.
So he swore me to secrecy.
He would hate this.
So much.
He would find it unacceptable.
I lie awake every night
thinking maybe I started something I shouldn't have.
I shouldn't have to choose between the person that I love
and the person I love.
I hope you don't have to.
I tried... not to love Penny, Mer.
I tried.
So hard.
I know. This all sucks.
Come on, Sofia, honey.
You had a really good time with her yesterday, okay?
Unh-unh.
Yes! You did.
You built forts and it was really fun.
Morning! Come on in!
I don't want to.
I'm sorry. It's been a really rough morning.
She woke up really early
and then she didn't have breakfast, so --
That's okay. We will make waffles, or --
I'm going with you.
I -- Oh, I can't. I can't. Mommy can't today.
I'm running late, and you're here to play with Zola,
but I will be back just as soon as I can.
No.
I'm sorry.
I-I'm sorry. I love you.
I hate you.
Okay, let's go find Zola.
She'll be fine.
Hey. How's Jenny doing?
She did okay overnight,
but her mean pressure is trending down.
I don't like it.
What does Russo say?
Russo says to watch and wait,
but I'm thinking about texting Arizona.
Arizona doesn't have all the answers.
She has more answers than Russo.
And you're just pissy because she fired you as a patient.
Shut up. She's got enough on her plate today.
Okay, look. - If Russo says watch and wait,
I say we watch and wait.
Any evidence of fetal distress on the monitor,
just let me know, okay?
And Dr. Torres and Sofia couldn't possibly be any closer.
So, you've seen them together frequently over the years.
All the time.
They went to the same daycare
and now - they're at the same school.
Sofia's actually at my house right now.
And what about Dr. Blake?
In your estimation, how does she get along with Sofia?
Great. Sofia loves Penny.
She's a great kid like that.
She's very open to new people as long as they're good people,
and Penny is a very good person.
Thank you, Dr. Grey.
It's your witness, Ms. Gamble.
You mentioned that Sofia is at your house today, Dr. Grey.
She is.
It must be nice for you and Dr. Torres
to have daughters around the same age.
And they get along, right?
It is very nice.
They love playing together.
So, who's watching your daughters
right now while you're here?
Their Aunt Amelia.
You recently lost your husband.
Is that correct?
I did.
My sincerest condolences.
Thank you.
So, you're a single parent.
I am.
And Callie's a single parent.
Is that a question, or --
So you two must help each other out a lot --
two single parents.
Callie drops Sofia off at your place sometimes
when she has to work or when she has plans
or when she needs a night off. Correct?
A "Night off"?
Being a mom isn't a job.
We don't punch in and punch out.
There are no nights off.
We are both single parents.
That's not a dirty word.
But we do need help getting our kids to where they need to be
with all of their limbs intact.
So we lean on each other.
That's not a sign of weakness or bad parenting,
if that's where you're going with this.
It takes a village, and we have a village.
Here in Seattle.
What?
The village you just mentioned --
the seamless support system these mothers built,
this essential network.
It's all here in Seattle.
Sofia's friends and her school, her teachers --
her home is here in Seattle.
That's what Sofia would be leaving.
Is that what you're saying?
No. I was saying --
No further questions, Your Honor.
Dr. Robbins was already a brilliant pediatric surgeon,
but since she's completed her fellowship,
I've watched her turn into
one of the most renowned fetal surgeons in the country.
A child would be lucky to have her as a role model parent.
No further questions, Your Honor.
Dr. Webber, you work with Dr. Robbins -- is that correct?
Uh, yes, that's correct.
Would you say there's overlap between your specialties?
Yes, there is.
So, you two have gotten close over the years.
Professionally.
We have. Yes.
Are you a trivia buff?
Yes.
So, you and Dr. Robbins have enjoyed trivia nights together.
That's correct, yes.
You go and play, drink,
and flirt with women -- is that correct?
No, it isn't. I'm married and I don't drink.
So Dr. Robbins did all the drinking and flirting.
You just went for the trivia?
That's an over-simplified --
It's a yes or no question, Dr. Webber.
Yes.
You're good at trivia?
Sure.
Don't be modest.
How many times do you think you and Dr. Robbins have won
over the past, oh, let's say six months?
I wasn't counting.
The bar was. They kept a running tally.
Does this piece of evidence, Document 3C,
refresh your recollection?
You've won 25 times in the past six months.
That's 25 nights Dr. Robbins was out drinking with you,
not including the times you lost.
Where was Sofia during those evenings?
I don't know.
I'm sorry. I didn't -- I didn't quite catch that.
I said I wasn't privy to her childcare schedule.
I would like to introduce into evidence Document 4C.
It is a transcript of text messages
from Dr. Robbins to Dr. Torres
asking her to take Sofia unexpectedly.
Callie and I swap all the time.
We have very flexible schedules.
Could you please tell the court the tally at the bottom?
Dr. Webber?
34.
34.
She asked Dr. Torres to switch with her 34 times.
We know she was out with you at least 25 times.
And that's in addition to the previously mentioned
92 times Dr. Robbins was unavailable
to parent her own child due to her professional demands.
Now, let's just pause and think about this for a minute.
There are only 180 days in six months' time,
and so far, we've counted approximately 150 times
in which Dr. Robbins shirked her duties.
150 out of 180.
Objection. Badgering the witness.
Calls for speculation.
Sustained.
Your Honor, we'd like to request a short recess.
So, Callie's okay slut-shaming me now?
Don't let them rattle you.
They're making it sound like a working mom is a bad mom.
I mean, we just lost in there, right?
'Cause they made me sound like
I was a selfish, irresponsible, sex-crazed --
Arizona. -I don't --
Stop.
You have your chance right now.
They tried to rewrite the story.
Now's your chance to set it straight.
You need to get up there, tell them the truth.
Judge Kane is smart.
She'll know the truth when she hears it.
You tell the truth, and you will win this.
When Sofia was born, how did that day start for you?
I was in a car accident.
Can you tell us what you remember about the accident?
I don't remember much, but I remember --
I remember waking up on the hood of the car
and I was covered in glass.
I was, um, barely --
I'm so sorry.
Take all the time you need.
I was barely conscious, um,
and the only thing that I could feel was just pain all over.
I could have died on the hood of that car.
And I wanted to give up.
But...I couldn't because I was pregnant with Sofia.
And if I died...she died.
So...I had to fight...
to stay alive, for my daughter's sake.
Being a mother is the reason I'm still alive today.
Jenny, your BP's borderline low,
but otherwise, your cardiac evaluation is good.
So, she's cleared for surgery.
Surgery. What surgery?
What happened?
Dr. Russo says we have to deliver.
Jenny's still leaking amniotic fluid,
which means we're out of time.
We need to do a C-section, deliver this baby.
Right now? I-It's too early, right?
It's not ideal, but there may be no choice.
Please don't. Not yet.
I don't want my baby to die.
Honey, everything is gonna be fine.
Can I see you outside?
If that baby comes out now --
It has to.
The fetal heart rate's already showing decreased variability.
Well, what can we do?
I can deliver, then you do what you can for the baby.
It's hard to keep those babies alive. The odds suck.
Compromised lungs, high risk of brain bleeds.
It's the only option left.
It's what we're doing.
So, I just lied to my daughter, and I will go back in there
and keep telling her that she'll be okay no matter what,
but to do that, I need to know that you have done
everything in your power to make this okay.
Can you tell me that?
Tell me that you have done everything you can
to keep my baby and grandchild alive.
Robbins wouldn't deliver.
Do you have another option?
Then I'll see you in surgery.
Is Robbins an option?
No.
Dr. Robbins, you were with Dr. Torres
before she was pregnant.
Yes.
Were you together when she got pregnant?
No.
So her pregnancy was not an agreement
you entered into together, correct?
No.
It was an agreement she entered into
with Dr. Mark Sloan, correct?
They agreed after the fact,
but, yes, Mark was Sofia's father.
Callie and I were together.
We were a couple before the pregnancy
and then after Sofia was conceived.
So, you became part of the parenting plan later, correct?
Just to be clear,
Dr. Sloan and Dr. Torres were Sofia's parents
and then you came around.
No, I didn't "Come around."
I'm Sofia's mother. I legally adopted her.
She doesn't want to go there.
No, she doesn't.
Her last names are Sloan and Torres.
I'm gonna have to stop you before you continue
for your own sake.
You're not going to imply that I'm any less Sofia's mother
because we don't share the same DNA.
Dr. Robbins, excuse me.
Because that would be offensive. It would be offensive
to anyone in the room who has an adopted child
or is an adopted child, and for you to say that --
Dr. Robbins --
I chose to be Sofia's mother!
It did not fall into my lap.
There was a choice, and I could stay or I could run,
and I chose motherhood.
And it was the best choice that I ever made.
I'm -- I'm -- I'm so sorry.
I'm a doctor, and I-I have to answer my phone, so I'm sorry.
I'm -- I'm so sorry.
Thank you.
Somewhere more important to be?
Actually, yes.
Excuse me?
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I love my child, and I want her with me,
but I know that, no matter how this ends,
she'll survive.
She'll be healthy and safe
and well-taken care of and loved.
Because...
we are her mothers.
But there's a child at the hospital who will not survive
unless I am there, so I have to --
I have to -- I have to go.
I am through the uterine wall.
More suction, please.
Vitals are holding.
Why isn't he stopping? Did you ask him to stop?
Yes. But he's insisting on taking the baby out.
Is he into the uterus?
Yes.
Well, did he cut the cord?
No, but he's close.
Tell him not to. Damn it!
I did.
Okay, everyone.
Change of plans.
Dr. Russo, please stop what you're doing.
Excuse me?
Hi, Tara. Hi, Jenny.
You're doing great, okay? Hey, Karev.
Cord's intact.
Beautiful.
Dr. Russo. I said stop. Now, please.
Robbins, I've almost completed the C-section.
But you won't be finishing it.
Someone tell me what's going on right now.
Um, Tara and Jenny, I am going to put that baby back in there
so it can cook a little bit more.
How's that sound to you?
You can do that?
It's not too late?
It is too late.
She's already lost most of the amniotic fluid.
There's not enough left.
I'm going to fill the depleted uterus with Lactated Ringer's,
and the baby's gonna be fine.
Warren, how's she doing?
Pressure's holding steady, but we should hurry.
Okay. Mom, I need your consent.
Dr. Robbins can give the baby more time.
Every additional week this baby stays inside,
the better the chances of its survival.
Mom?
We trust Dr. Robbins.
Okay. Uh, Dr. Russo, thank you for your help.
Please scrub out.
Unbelievable.
Okay, Jenny.
We're gonna put you out for now, all right?
Tara, you want to say hi to your grandbaby?
What is it?
It's a girl.
You have a daughter.
Is she pretty?
She's beautiful. She looks just like you did.
Okay. We need to say goodbye to her now.
Goodbye for now.
Goodbye, little girl.
No matter what the judge decides,
I know that you're a good mom, too.
And I just want you to know this doesn't change that.
The things that you let them say about me --
I would never have done that to you.
Never.
I'm sorry. The judge is ready for you.
All rise and come to order.
Honorable Judge Madeline Kane presiding.
Please be seated.
I've taken all testimony
and evidence in this matter under submission.
And after careful consideration, my ruling is as follows.
I hereby grant sole physical custody
of Sofia Robbin Sloan Torres to...
Oh. Have you heard anything?
No, not yet.
Robbins said she'd text as soon as the judge decided.
Torres, too.
This sucks.
What the hell?
Give him a stat CT with contrast.
What happened? Why wasn't I paged?
Why would you care?
He passed out. Possible meningitis.
She's not my doctor.
I don't want her here.
Get her out of here.
Wilson.
No, don't. I'm --
I'm going.
I'm going.
If you're wondering how the Solomon story ends...
Did you get all your things from upstairs, Sofia?
Your books and everything?
...spoiler alert --
the true mom would rather give her baby up
than have it ripped in two.
Hi, sweetie.
But what happens when there are two true mothers?
How the hell did this happen?
How?
How the hell did this happen?
That's a no-win situation.
Mommy.
Can we go home now?
Yeah. We sure can.
Let's go home.
That is an entirely different story.
