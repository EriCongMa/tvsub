j @-@ serve has stolen millions
of dollars of intellectual property .
this civil suit can &apos;t proceed
until the criminal case has been resolved .
if you help us beat the feds ,
we can pick up where we left off .
you &apos;re serious ?
yes .
what choice do you have ?
turning to god .
what role has god
played in your life , senator kirk ?
pastor , they say there are no atheists in foxholes .
after my stroke , i was in a very , very deep , uh , foxhole .
hmm . so @-@ so you think you &apos;ve become more religious ?
i &apos;ve become more respectful of other people &apos;s faiths .
i &apos;ve heard you you go home every friday from the senate
to spend the jewish sabbath with your family .
i go home every friday to be with my family .
we &apos;re members of congregation beth elohim .
it &apos;s where i feel at home in the heart of brooklyn .
so , i have to do that ?
if you want to get elected .
i thought it was a mistake to talk about religion .
it is except for pastor jeremiah &apos;s interview .
you run for office in chicago , you have to kiss the ring .
these political rules keep changing
whenever you want them to .
yes , but you &apos;re on record saying you &apos;re an atheist , alicia .
and voters don &apos;t vote for atheists .
so , you need to take this opportunity to say
that you &apos;ve changed .
changed to what ?
to someone who isn &apos;t an atheist .
and if i don &apos;t say that ?
then you &apos;ll lose .
and if i say it &apos;s none of their business ?
it is their business .
my lack of religion is their business ?
yes , you &apos;re asking them to vote for you
so they deserve to know who you are .
i &apos;m an atheist .
they deserve to know who we want them to think you are .
i &apos;m your body woman .
i &apos;m sorry ?
i &apos;m your body woman ?
i didn &apos;t know what it was either .
it &apos;s like your personal assistant .
i stick to you , making sure you &apos;re on time ,
get on calls and your food isn &apos;t poisoned .
i &apos;m marissa . eli &apos;s daughter .
oh , right . hi .
i actually don &apos;t think i need a body woman .
yes , you do .
dad would be upset if you said no
&apos;cause i &apos;m supposed to spy for him .
but i &apos;m not a very good spy . so don &apos;t worry .
excuse me . i &apos;m gonna ...
hello ?
alicia , where are you ?
um , where am i ?
yes , you &apos;re not here .
uh , elsbeth , where are you ?
the fbi .
we &apos;re meeting with perotti about the trade secret case .
tomorrow .
no , today .
yes , today until they called and said tomorrow .
and they called everyone but me ?
elsbeth , i have to go .
i &apos;ll see you in court tomorrow .
this department considers this ...
i am a busy woman , mr. perotti .
i have more things to do with my time
than to come here like a ,
like a woman dragged here out of her day .
how are you , elsbeth ?
if you want to have lunch with me , call my office .
but don &apos;t pretend it &apos;s about business ,
then call everybody else not to show up ,
so it &apos;ll just be me showing up .
i don &apos;t like that tie .
i &apos;ll change it . camryn ?
did you call ms. tascioni and mrs. florrick last night
and say i had to cancel ?
yes , sir . i got ms. tascioni &apos;s secretary .
fantasia .
i &apos;m gonna go .
so , i could ask you to lunch ?
i only said that as an example .
is this case about me ?
elsbeth , your client plagiarized their software
from another company .
they did not .
and even if they did , they sell farting apps .
they sell jumping grasshopper apps .
and encryption software .
why is the federal government suddenly so interested
in protecting the code of a grasshopper app ?
because the code was plagiarized from a defense contractor .
you &apos;re making that up .
i &apos;m not .
well , you &apos;re still gonna lose .
alicia florrick is on my side .
you expected to divide and conquer us .
but it &apos;s gonna be hard to do with both of us battling you .
elsbeth , what are you doing ?
i &apos;m marshalling my forces . i &apos;m ...
the way you &apos;re walking . what @-@ what is that ?
you &apos;re scared of sidewalk grates .
no . what ? !
yes ! the way you &apos;re walking .
you were avoiding the grates .
no !
oh , my god ! you &apos;re so adorable . come here .
walk with me .
no , i &apos;m fine .
come on .
stop it ! stop it ! stop that !
these things can support 10,000 pounds .
i could be carrying a humvee
and i would still ... oh !
that was mean .
what do you smell like ? it &apos;s beautiful .
baby lotion .
baby lotion .
i &apos;m wearing old spice .
have lunch with me .
no .
i have to go .
this case is wrong .
and you need to stop it .
lockhart / gardner / canning , please hold .
lockhart / gardner / canning ,
would you mind holding , please ?
this is lockhart / gardner / canning ...
family is important to this firm .
i realize it &apos;s an old fashioned thing to say
because we live in cynical times ,
but we treat our clients like they &apos;re family .
we &apos;re highly accessible , which is why i give them my cell ...
son of a bitch !
we &apos;re being evicted .
how is that even possible ?
diane still sub @-@ leases to us .
when will died she became the primary lease @-@ holder .
so , what does she want-- money ?
no . she wants us out so she can move in . look .
i have a friend at osha .
jacques cousteau &apos;s son ?
what ?
at ... osha ?
see if we can set her up as an absentee landlord .
yes , we can load up on all the osha infractions .
&quot; handrails or ramps .
&quot; $ 120,000 for installation .
&quot; handicapped restroom stall .
&quot; 98,000 .
&quot; warped reception floor .
$ 333,000 . &quot;
and you &apos;re wondering if we should pay ?
yes , the total is $ 650,000 .
i don &apos;t understand .
can &apos;t we evict them without paying ?
yes . but then they &apos;ll sue .
the question is do we take the hit ?
no , the question is why are we moving at all ?
cary , we already voted .
alicia , we are ending up right back where we started .
yes , but we will still be us .
we won &apos;t be lockhart / gardner .
the whole point of starting our own firm
was so that we can build something on our own .
and if we weren &apos;t financially in a hole ,
we might be able to do more with our infrastructure .
come on . i didn &apos;t ask you to bail me out .
cary , i wasn &apos;t talking about bail .
you may not need to pay .
what do you mean ? alicia , cary , hold on . hold on !
all rise !
i have to go anyway .
i &apos;ll call you later .
canning has real estate .
my guess is he &apos;ll have just as many osha issues on his property .
good . see what you can find out .
let &apos;s hold off on discussing this
until kalinda can find out more .
cary , where are you ?
five dollars .
ivy core-- the five ivy league law schools .
every time someone does work , it &apos;s five dollars .
let &apos;s go .
pay up .
my name is nils landrusyshym .
that &apos;s spelled the usual way .
it &apos;s l @-@ a @-@ n @-@ d @-@ r @-@ u @-@ s-
y @-@ s @-@ h @-@ y @-@ m .
i &apos;m an app designer at j @-@ serve .
and before that you worked at qzo systems .
is that correct , mr. landrusyshym ?
you pronounced my name right . thanks , man .
well , that &apos;s because i listen .
objection .
mr. perotti is trying to endear himself to the witness .
in my opinion .
what ?
you have to say &quot; in my opinion . &quot;
are you hazing me ?
in my opinion , your honor .
sustained .
uh , i &apos;m sor ... uh , what was the objection ?
what am i doing wrong ?
don &apos;t endear yourself to the witness .
okay . thank you , ms. tascioni .
mrs.
&quot; mrs. &quot; ?
you &apos;re married ?
i was . i &apos;m divorced .
i didn &apos;t know that .
you didn &apos;t ask .
excuse me , counselors .
we &apos;re in the middle of questioning here .
oh , sorry .
um , what was the question ?
uh , before j @-@ serve , did he work at qzo systems ?
you may answer , mr. landroo @-@ shim @-@ shum .
yes , i did .
and qzo is a contractor
for the united states department of defense , isn &apos;t it ?
yup .
if you &apos;re ever looking for a tracking or a monitoring system ,
they &apos;re your go @-@ to .
mr. landrusyshym , what is that ?
those are lines of code . from the delcheck app .
code that you wrote ?
uh , yeah .
a nils landrusyshym original .
camilla , the app that he was working on--
did you sell that as part of the package to china ?
yes . why ?
and what is that ?
uh , that looks like the same code .
it is , in fact .
this is identical code used by your former employer qzo .
code which you also wrote .
you used the same code in each company &apos;s product .
your honor , objection .
the ausa , in our opinion ,
is not being upfront about the real charges .
i &apos;m not sure what the defense is talking about , your honor .
your ... honor ?
in your opinion .
uh , in my opinion , your honor .
i would agree , ms. florrick .
what is the issue here ?
this is a trojan horse prosecution , your honor .
the ausa , in our opinion ,
has no intention of trying our client ,
camilla vargas , on trade secret charges .
china ? !
mr. perotti intends to bring economic espionage charges
against our client , in my opinion ,
and he has disguised his true intentions
to get our witnesses on the record .
is that true , mr. perotti ?
your honor ...
answer the question ,
ausa ?
camilla vargas was ceo of j @-@ serve
when they sold proprietary software
from a defense contractor to a chinese company .
a civil chinese company .
a civil chinese company with ties to the chinese government .
that encryption software designed for our defense
is now in the hands of the chinese .
and those responsible at j @-@ serve are now subject
to charges of economic espionage ,
with a minimum sentence of ten to 15 years
in a federal penitentiary .
oh , my god .
so , yes , i would like to amend the charge
to economic espionage .
in my opinion .
第六季 第六集
how do you stop a lawyer from drowning ?
shoot him before he hits the water .
you really do know them all !
so , what &apos;s the name of your firm ?
florrick @-@ agos .
right , right . the governor &apos;s wife . yeah .
good firm ?
yeah , yeah . we have our days .
i heard one of the partners got in trouble .
arrested or something .
yeah .
cary agos .
right . what &apos;s he like ?
he is a good guy .
ah , you are , you are looking at him .
really ?
thank you . okay . tonight . 8 : 00 p.m.
castro interviews first . you second .
what do i say ?
you walk back the atheism .
yes , but how ?
you don &apos;t need to bring me coffee , marissa .
it &apos;s not coffee , it &apos;s milk .
dad says you should use the courthouse shooting .
it made you decide to change your life .
no , i &apos;m not gonna use that . why milk ?
why not ?
&quot; recently ,
&quot; i &apos;ve realized my negativity toward religion was based on
seeing the hypocrisy among the ultra @-@ conservative . &quot;
what is that ?
it &apos;s a quote . for you .
&quot; but then i realized there is great warmth and beauty
in a higher being . &quot;
&quot; realized &quot; ? what is she , eight ?
she just &quot; realized ... &quot;
whoa . excuse me .
the body woman isn &apos;t supposed to talk so much .
oh , uh , i guess i &apos;m not supposed to have an opinion .
how about that book by barbara ehrenreich ?
why don &apos;t you say you &apos;ve read it
and you got to thinking about god in a new way ?
sort of a ... epiphany .
they don &apos;t want to hear about epiphanies .
they &apos;re like orthodox jews .
they want to know if you &apos;re in their column .
who are you calling ?
hello ? grace , it &apos;s mom .
religion is in my life again .
so , you &apos;re the felon ?
that &apos;s me , the hardened criminal .
you heading out ?
i was . back to lockup .
so harvard to holding .
sounds like a book .
a short one .
three days behind bars-- that doesn &apos;t give you much material .
no gang rape ?
no .
strangely enough , not .
well , that &apos;s too bad .
&apos;cause that would &apos;ve been a turn @-@ on .
is that baby lotion ?
it &apos;s not enough to show that the codes are similar .
to prove economic espionage , they need to show that you knew
the chinese company was going to give it to the government .
good . because i didn &apos;t .
okay , i &apos;ll cross @-@ examine .
why ?
the ausa has a thing for me .
i think i can distract him .
all rise .
edwin fong .
owner and managing partner
of the fong consulting group .
mr. fong ,
you are the one who brokered the sale of the app in question
between j @-@ serve and the baowen group ?
i did . j @-@ serve was eager to make a bigger push into china .
i connected them with mr. baowen .
so you worked closely with camilla vargas
when she was ceo ?
the defendant ?
for three years , yes .
she was the one who hired my firm .
okay .
and did you keep ms. vargas in the loop
during the app negotiations ?
i did . i had to .
she wanted to know every detail .
and did she , uh ...
did the defendant ... uh , did , um ...
ms. vargas .
right . ms. vargas .
did she ... did , uh ...
uh , strike that .
did you ask her whether
mr. baowen &apos;s company was connected to the chinese government ?
yes . and i told her yes .
that &apos;s a lie .
so she knew this app--
this stolen app-- would make its way to the chinese ?
objection , your honor .
calls for speculation , in my opinion .
yes . sustained .
mr. perotti ?
yes , your honor .
oh , i &apos;m good . i &apos;m good .
no further ...
questions .
mr. fong , is camilla vargas a bitch ?
objection , your honor . that calls for an opinion .
actually , your honor , i &apos;m just quoting mr. fong
from last week &apos;s trial .
&quot; i advised j @-@ serve
&quot; that china is a patriarchal society .
&quot; and having a brash and bitchy
female ceo was problematic . &quot;
didn &apos;t you say that , mr. fong ?
yes , but just to be clear ,
i put air @-@ quotes around &quot; bitchy . &quot;
so you were quoting
someone who called her bitchy ?
no .
and , um , wasn &apos;t it your opinion that ms. vargas
be left out of the negotiations ?
didn &apos;t you testify to that ?
is that a &quot; yes , &quot; mr. fong ?
yes .
in fact , you went over her head
to the board of directors ,
and kept key information away from ms. vargas .
mr. fong ?
yes .
nothing further .
it &apos;s odd , being back .
it &apos;s like being behind enemy lines .
looks good .
oh , yeah .
good evening .
and to you as well .
may i offer you something to drink ?
um , no , we &apos;re fine .
any more pleasantries or shall we start ?
how is your health , mr. canning ?
well , i &apos;m on a list for kidney transplants .
i &apos;m sorry .
oh , don &apos;t be .
at least i &apos;m on the list .
and , uh , i feel kind of ghoulish ,
waiting for someone to die and give me a kidney .
well , i really , um ...
i hope things work out .
thank you .
i don &apos;t suppose one of those folders holds
a check for $ 550,000 ?
44 brewer street . 1530 carpenter avenue .
220 lonsdale road .
what ?
those are my buildings .
they &apos;re @-@ they &apos;re using the same
osha complaints against me
that i used against them .
yes , there are a dozen violations
of the americans with disabilities act .
total cost to repair is $ 1.6 million .
if you drop
the osha charges against me ,
we won &apos;t push these against you .
okay .
louis .
no , they @-@ they have us .
we won &apos;t report your violations .
you have my word .
well , thank you .
and , uh , again , i &apos;m very sorry
about your health issues .
let me know if i can do anything .
well , there is something .
so we went back to the amendment
to the lease agreement . page 24,
paragraph 18c .
it requires your physical presence
on the premises , diane .
and your physical presence ended
when you walked out . four weeks ago ?
four weeks , two days .
since you &apos;re in violation of this lease
and no longer have any legal hold on the property ...
you can &apos;t evict us .
but , diane ,
thank you for your concern .
do you want to drop this ?
what do you mean ?
well , there is a way to beat them .
how ? i haven &apos;t been here for four weeks .
i remember having that amendment inserted
when i thought that will would push me out .
it doesn &apos;t require your personal presence .
it just requires a partner
from florrick @-@ agos to be an occupant .
who ?
no .
yep .
and how do you pray ?
with acts ?
with any other mnemonic device ?
acts . that &apos;s from the bible ?
no , um ... acts .
adoration , confession ,
thanksgiving and supplication .
it &apos;s to remind you how to pray :
not just to ask for things .
but , mom , you don &apos;t need to know all this .
i know , i just want to feel comfortable .
it &apos;s like opening arguments in court .
i know i won &apos;t use it all ,
but it makes me confident .
are you going to say that you believe in god ?
no .
are you going to say that you &apos;re an atheist ?
no .
then what are you gonna say ?
i don &apos;t know .
that i think i &apos;m struggling with it ?
are you ?
no .
maybe . i don &apos;t know .
you want some help with that ?
i can &apos;t believe in god , grace .
i know .
why not ?
i don &apos;t feel it the way you do .
i don &apos;t feel the need .
then what &apos;s the struggle ?
politics .
okay .
you don &apos;t judge me ?
no .
i love you .
hold on , hold on . gotta get my keys .
oh , damn .
what ?
mr. agos . good evening .
ms. grubick .
you &apos;ve been drinking , mr. agos .
i have .
which is my right .
it is . any drugs ?
not yet . but the night is young .
no , she &apos;s joking .
no , i &apos;m not .
who is this , cary ?
i am mr. agos &apos;s pretrial services officer .
my job is to make certain
mr. agos lives up to the dictates of his bail .
i wish you called , ms. grubick .
well , when i spot @-@ check , i don &apos;t call .
where &apos;s your bathroom ?
through there .
which of you drove home ?
neither . we were too inebriated .
good .
how many bedrooms ?
one .
did you take a taxi ?
no , we got an uber .
oh , good , an uber car .
can i see ?
see ... ?
the , uh , record on your iphone .
you don &apos;t have to show her anything !
i &apos;m not lying .
i didn &apos;t think you were .
cary , you &apos;re obviously
severely inebriated .
you weren &apos;t at work all day .
your immediate superior didn &apos;t know where you were .
i was at a harvard mixer .
your companion says you &apos;re planning to use drugs .
she was joking .
all i &apos;m asking
is to see the uber trip on your iphone
to confirm that you were not driving .
click on the uber app for me , please ?
thank you .
what ?
cary , i &apos;m going to have to call officers ,
place you under arrest .
what ? why ?
you went over the state line .
you were in indiana .
oh , come on .
are you kidding me ?
no .
the terms of your bail were quite explicit .
you are confined to illinois .
it was a half @-@ mile into indiana .
yeah , and i told you
to take this more seriously .
the court takes this very seriously .
hello , yes .
this is , uh , pso 12 @-@ 385 .
i need an officer .
please , ms. grubick . i made a mistake .
i wasn &apos;t thinking about where i was going .
1313 barbary court .
no rush .
thank you .
this is stupid .
three ... two ... one .
and now , turning to god ...
now why do you say &quot; uh @-@ oh &quot; ?
i think you &apos;re preparing
to pull a quote from my past .
that &apos;s fine , she &apos;s doing fine .
you &apos;re making me nervous .
oh , i have to go get her .
well , a matter of fact , uh ...
two years ago , you went on the record
and declared that you were an atheist .
now , do you still believe that ?
do i believe that i &apos;m an atheist ?
you were quite insistent at the time .
that sounds like me .
my life has gone through a lot of changes over the years .
you &apos;re speaking of the scandal ?
yes , and everything .
if you had asked me six years ago where i would be today ,
it would not be running for state &apos;s attorney .
yes , life is humbling .
it is that .
and with each passing month ,
i find my dogmatism decreasing .
i don &apos;t understand .
well , i can &apos;t say for certain
that god doesn &apos;t exist .
ugh , say it positively , not negatively .
okay . so you &apos;re not not an atheist .
i &apos;m sorry , that &apos;s my inner @-@ lawyer coming out .
i &apos;m listening .
if it &apos;s one thing i hate it &apos;s when people don &apos;t listen .
so , i &apos;m open .
to people who talk about god ?
yes . recently ,
i have looked for answers outside of myself .
is this due to the shooting in the courthouse
last year of your law partner ?
i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s probably still difficult
for you to talk about that .
it is .
good , good .
there &apos;s never a way to prepare for death .
no .
and god sometimes fills the void .
you were talking about listening to people
who share their love of god .
now , is one of those people your daughter , grace ?
i understand that she &apos;s become a christian , herself ,
over the last couple of years .
yes , it is not just the politicians
who have good research interns .
has grace talked to you ?
yes .
and shared her witness ?
well , she &apos;s talked to me about god .
you love your daughter very much , don &apos;t you ?
yes .
i know you &apos;re uncomfortable talking about christ
and grace sharing her faith journey ,
but she must have had some kind of impact on your thinking ?
yes , she has .
mrs. florrick .
yes , that &apos;s it .
i know you don &apos;t pray , not yet .
but i want to pray with you .
and i &apos;m sure grace is praying at this very moment for you , too .
god , thank you for alicia &apos;s honesty tonight ...
that went well .
i was in israel for a couple years .
everybody there talks about god .
like he &apos;s some uncle hiding in the attic .
drives you crazy .
do you believe in god ?
yeah , but even i don &apos;t like talking about it .
i don &apos;t like pretending to be someone i &apos;m not
when i &apos;m being interviewed .
really ? you &apos;re good at it .
your honor , it was one quarter of a mile outside of illinois .
it doesn &apos;t matter if it was one mile or a hundred miles .
yes , it does .
this is the kind of minutia that makes the law insane .
cary drove ten minutes from his home to a harvard get @-@ together .
the route just happened to take him outside of the state .
yes , and i just acted as asa on five bail hearings
where the bail was revoked due to similarly picayune reasons .
and the only reason that we &apos;re debating this is
because mr. agos went to a harvard mixer , and he &apos;s white .
this is not a race issue .
oh , it is , actually .
your honor ...
no !
i talk now .
there was a man just in here in tears ,
but i had to revoke his bail
because he went to his child &apos;s birthday .
so , yeah , i agree mr. agos ,
it is a minor offense ,
but the law is the law .
now , how long will it take you to finish your report ,
miss , uh ... lucy ? i mean , miss ...
you .
24 hours .
good , advise me on how to modify the bail restrictions ,
and then i &apos;ll make my decision .
that &apos;s it .
good morning .
morning .
what &apos;s up ?
not much , why ?
have you heard this song i heard on the radio ?
&quot; call me maybe &quot; ?
yeah .
i like it .
is it popular ?
it ... it was , a few years ago .
guess i &apos;m late to everything .
i just , i can &apos;t get it out of my head .
* hey , i just met you *
* and this is crazy ... *
you &apos;re good , right ?
oh , yeah .
me ?
oh , yeah .
stanley pronovost .
i &apos;m an analyst in the cia &apos;s
directorate of science and technology .
mr. pronovost , are you familiar with the delcheck app
designed by j @-@ serve , the defendant &apos;s company ?
yes .
and have you analyzed the app &apos;s decryption code ?
i have .
now , have you seen this decryption code anywhere else ?
yes , last month .
kid on my staff came across a program out of beijing
with the exact same code .
and to whom did this program belong ?
the mss , china &apos;s cia .
and how could the mss use this program ?
it &apos;d be like a swiss army knife for hackers .
they could break into almost any database .
banks , brokerage houses .
even stock exchanges .
you want me ?
this is a young firm , with young partners .
you bring experience , wisdom .
you have a lot to teach people , howard .
well , this is ... bit out of the blue .
well , when one is pursuing excellence ,
does timing really matter ?
the last time someone tried to woo me was 1958 .
farrow &amp; mcdaniel .
good thing i said no-- they went belly up in &apos; 59 .
well , if you &apos;d said yes , maybe they &apos;d still be around .
want more money .
howard ,
you know this isn &apos;t about money for somebody like you .
come on , it &apos;s about being in court .
it &apos;s about the rush of cross @-@ examination .
canning and david lee , they won &apos;t let you argue in court .
they don &apos;t believe in you .
we do .
okay , so you want any app sold to the chinese ?
we think the feds are overreaching here .
the chinese could &apos;ve gotten the encryption code
from any civilian @-@ purchased app .
okay , i &apos;m on it , um ...
how &apos;s cary doing ?
how &apos;s he ... ?
what ?
why ? what do you mean ?
the spot @-@ check last night .
i haven &apos;t seen him here .
uh ... what ?
he was re @-@ arrested last night .
miss sharma ?
yep .
i &apos;m joy grubick .
i &apos;m mr. agos &apos;s pretrial services officer .
you have a few minutes to talk ?
so ... yes !
you are the firm &apos;s private investigator ?
yes , i am .
and before that , you held a similar position
with lockhart / gardner .
or was it lockhart / gardner / canning ? wait , no , um ...
both of them . and , yes , i worked there .
yes .
uh , do you work closely with mr. agos ?
yes .
and does your relationship extend to the personal ?
we &apos;re friends .
in 2012 , uh ...
you were arrested ...
for harassing a juror .
well , the charge was dropped .
but you were arrested ?
yeah .
2011 ? yes , &apos; 11 .
you were the subject of a grand jury hearing
for the beating of a witness ,
a psychologist named dr. booth ?
well , there was no indictment .
i &apos;d never met dr. booth .
so , have you worked for mr. agos
on any of the lemond bishop cases ?
yes , for alicia florrick and diane lockhart .
so , i &apos;m assuming that , uh ...
you have regular interaction with , uh , mr. bishop ?
had .
he &apos;s no longer a client .
oh .
uh ... well , what about mr. bishop &apos;s employees ?
might you interact with them ?
of his legitimate businesses , yes .
you have an opinion ...
on whether mr. agos is fit for further bail release ?
i do .
he &apos;s the most honest person i know .
and his re @-@ arrest is a testament
to the inadequacies of the cook county system , not of cary agos .
it &apos;s not what you think .
fantasia !
she &apos;s gone , she let me in .
you need to go .
i couldn &apos;t stand it when you said you were married in court .
well , i was married .
i wanted to yell right there .
why ?
&apos;cause ...
i looked at you .
oh , i really need to work out more .
no , i used to be a lot skinnier .
you are the most beautiful woman i &apos;ve ever met .
this is wrong . we &apos;re in court together .
baby lotion .
dear god .
i couldn &apos;t get the smell of you out of my mind .
damn your old spice to hell .
thank you , god , for all your blessings .
thank you for tonight and for being with friends .
and for stimulating conversation .
and for your great word .
we &apos;re especially thankful tonight for grace .
she has done something extraordinary in the last 24 hours , jesus .
she has reached her mother .
her mom is finally listening to her .
her mom , whose heart was hardened ,
has finally come around .
so i want us all to take grace &apos;s example
and never give up on our loved ones .
thank you , grace .
in jesus &apos; name we pray . amen .
amen .
so what did you say , grace , that made your mom listen ?
um , well , you know , she &apos;s still struggling .
we all are .
the important thing is she opened the door even an inch .
and you opened that door .
hello , gentlemen .
how &apos;d you get past reception ?
i let them in .
what now , diane ?
i &apos;m here about my lease .
page 24 , paragraph 18d .
you think just showing up counts as physical presence ?
there &apos;s not a court in the land ...
actually , no . we &apos;re talking about paragraph 18d .
if the leaseholder is unable to be physically on the premises ,
said obligation may be fulfilled by his or her proxy .
say hello to his or her proxy .
you hired him ?
it &apos;s your final eviction notice .
you have 24 hours .
my physical presence and i will be in my office ,
should you need me .
hi .
kalinda , anything on the other apps ?
hi , kalinda .
it &apos;s elsbeth , too .
hi , elsbeth .
no , um , nothing with any kind of decryption code .
but , in 2002 , the same chinese company
bought a firewall program
from a boston firm by the name of cunneyworth dunlap .
cunneyworth ? what is that ?
it &apos;s a cia front company .
you &apos;re kidding .
no . they had to close shop
cia特工 因遭报复被曝光身份
a few months later after their name appeared
in news stories about the valerie plame affair .
okay , well , we can argue double standard ,
that the u.s. government did the same thing
they &apos;re accusing j @-@ serve of .
do you have any documentation ?
i &apos;m trying to get my hands on an invoice ,
but it &apos;s gonna take some time .
we &apos;ll ask for a further delay .
okay .
no .
yes , elsbeth ?
no .
i think there might be another way .
what other way ?
i &apos;ve got his buttons .
are you all right ?
yeah . why ?
i heard about last night .
yeah . 800 yards into indiana , and i &apos;m a felon again .
well , we &apos;re here for you , cary .
i know we &apos;ve had our differences about work ,
but anything you need , we &apos;re here .
i think it &apos;s best i take a break from work .
no .
alicia , they &apos;re coming after me ,
and whatever i do , i &apos;m an anvil here .
no .
we do this together .
okay .
after further interviews , this officer concludes
that the bail infraction was inadvertent .
but the officer also concludes that mr. agos has been
casual in his conformity to judicial rulings .
therefore , we advise further restrictions on bail .
what restrictions ?
ankle monitoring bracelet and a 9 : 00 curfew .
your honor , lawyer hours
would make this highly impractical .
that &apos;s unfortunate . i don &apos;t care .
what else , ms. grubick ?
no contact with the firm investigator
kalinda sharma .
i &apos;m sorry , what ?
uh , 725 ilcs 185
prohibits interaction with anyone considered dangerous .
why is she dangerous ?
prior arrests ,
a grand jury charge and contact with lemond bishop .
this is unacceptable , your honor . ms. sharma is
an integral part of the operation of mr. agos &apos;s firm .
yes , and kalinda sharma works closely on mr. agos &apos;s cases ,
as well as being a social , uh , acquaintance ,
but my report advises that the court &apos;s rulings are paramount .
asa polmar , do you agree with these added restrictions ?
we do , your honor .
all right .
the bail is approved ,
but only with these further restrictions applying .
and if you break the rules again , young man ,
your bail will be revoked ,
and you &apos;ll spend the rest of your time until trial behind bars .
hi .
hi .
here are your buttons .
oh . thank you . oh , and here ...
is one of yours i found in my hair this morning .
that song &apos;s been in my head .
actually , i &apos;m here for work .
oh .
one of our investigators , kalinda sharma ,
found an invoice from a cia shell company
that sold firewall software
to everyone &apos;s favorite chinese company .
i think the judge would love to hear how the justice department
is selectively prosecuting us .
mm . i take it you have an original invoice as proof .
i do indeed .
how do i know you &apos;re not faking ?
that was evidence !
yes .
and now it &apos;s gone .
what you just did is illegal .
no , what you think i just did was illegal .
you just dropped it in your shredder .
yes . i &apos;m sorry .
so ... last night didn &apos;t matter to you ?
it did .
but work is work .
so you are fully aware that you just destroyed evidence ,
assistant united states attorney josh perotti ,
9 : 47 a.m.
nice try , elsbeth .
but that recording is inadmissible .
it requires two @-@ party consent .
well , then you need to spend more time in illinois
and less in d.c. , because this state &apos;s supreme court
recently struck down the two @-@ party consent law .
i only need one party .
and that &apos;s me .
and i , oh ... i consent .
so ... call me .
maybe .
are you sure about this , mr. perotti ?
yes , your honor .
we are withdrawing all charges
against j @-@ serve and camilla vargas .
the justice department considers this matter closed .
okay , then .
this was a supreme waste of time .
in your opinion ?
thank you , both .
now we can go back to suing you for $ 23 million .
oh , i can &apos;t wait .
see you in court .
you shouldn &apos;t have done it .
you shouldn &apos;t have either .
are you heading out ?
yeah , back to d.c.
bye , elsbeth .
good @-@ bye , josh .
you &apos;ve got to be kidding me .
well , the first order of business is replacing that .
they removed the &quot; f , &quot; the &quot; a , &quot; and the &quot; l. &quot;
subtle .
well , cary says he &apos;s fine with david lee &apos;s office ,
so i guess this is you and me .
no , take mine .
no , diane .
i could use a fresh start .
you take my office .
i won &apos;t hear of it .
