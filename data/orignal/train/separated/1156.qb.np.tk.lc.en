well , i spoke to hanna &apos;s mom
and she said that she could look after you .
look at the card .
what fun !
two little liars under one roof .
you are making it so easy .
a
sorry to interrupt , but it &apos;s about mike .
how was the dinner party ?
it was fine ...
till the cops showed up to let us know that our son
had been arrested for breaking and entering .
i see you doing sketchy stuff and i worry about you .
you already know more about me than anybody else .
so why can &apos;t we just keep it where it is ?
a hockey stick ?
part of one .
and it was buried ?
i thought it was some old junk till your dad saw it .
you can &apos;t burn that .
i can do whatever i want with junk i find on my property .
please .
stop it !
look , from now on , i need to figure out how to be happy ,
and i &apos;d like to do that here .
so who &apos;s jason ?
ali &apos;s brother .
no , i know that , i just didn &apos;t know he was friends of the family .
things are a little tense right now between me and isabel .
no , you &apos;re staying here because you &apos;re still in love with mom .
we &apos;ve turned a corner .
stop using me as an excuse .
you took things from emily . you broke into spencer &apos;s house .
you stole from a blind girl .
i got that from garrett reynolds &apos; apartment .
do the police know what kind of weapon the killer used on alison ?
that would all be in the coroner &apos;s report .
so it would say what she was hit with ?
ali &apos;s killer is dead .
it was just the two of you , sitting in garrett &apos;s car ?
i didn &apos;t know where else to meet him .
it wasn &apos;t like i could ask him that stuff down at the precinct .
how did you get away from him ?
when you sent me that text ,
i told him it was from my mom . she wanted me home asap .
am i still shaking ? i &apos;m still shaking .
yeah , we &apos;re all shaking . can you turn on the heat ?
you could make a slushy back here .
guys , why would jenna give him that lantern ?
you don &apos;t know that she gave it to him .
what do you think ,
he bought it at the blind artists &apos; crafts fair ?
of course she gave it to him .
the question is , when did they become buddies ?
and why ?
spencer , they grew up across the street from each other .
his parents still live in that house .
maybe he &apos;s just bringing raw meat to jenna &apos;s cat .
toby lives there , too , and they don &apos;t have a cat .
then maybe he was bringing over raw meat for jenna .
here comes em .
who &apos;s living in her house now ?
some losers who can &apos;t figure out the alarm system .
they &apos;ve tripped it like three times .
the security company keeps calling her mom in texas .
everything okay ?
yeah , it &apos;s fine .
it &apos;s just so weird to walk in there and see other people &apos;s stuff .
hey , why don &apos;t you tell &apos; em
to lay off the alarm for a couple of days ?
i &apos;m guessing they don &apos;t feel safe .
well , they will now .
i &apos;m sure aria &apos;s parents
are gonna have mike on lockdown till he turns 18 .
you did not just say that , hanna .
what ? i &apos;m not judging .
i &apos;m just guessing that your little brother
will find another hobby besides breaking and entering .
still talking .
guys , look , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on with my brother .
if i knew , you would know .
emily ?
isn &apos;t that garrett &apos;s car ?
i think it is .
where &apos;s he going ?
to his parents &apos; , i guess .
oh , my god . he &apos;s going into jenna &apos;s house .
is toby home ?
no , he went to go get his parents from the airport ,
and i thought he said jenna went with him .
he &apos;s going inside .
he just walked in .
can you walk any softer ?
please , jenna can &apos;t hear us . she &apos;s blind .
you ...
you know what i mean .
jeez , give it a rest , em .
i need to work on my core .
no , you don &apos;t . you were doing sit @-@ ups in your sleep last night .
i didn &apos;t sleep .
yeah , me neither .
but why bother when you can have a nightmare
just by parking in front of the cavanaugh house ?
i still can &apos;t believe it &apos;s garrett .
that &apos;s who jenna was buying that lingerie for .
i don &apos;t wanna talk about it . it &apos;s too early .
here , hydrate .
oh , not that much . i have to watch my sugar intake .
watch mine , &apos; cause i &apos;m about to have a big ass bowl &apos;s cocoa puffs .
are you always like this before a meet ?
it &apos;s not just a meet . the scout from danby &apos;s coming .
this could be my last chance turn the lie around before it gets worse .
em , you only lied to your parents .
isn &apos;t that enough .
look , i &apos;m just saying , they &apos;re in texas now .
maybe the more time that goes by--
they &apos;ll forget ? it &apos;s another zip code , hanna ,
not a parallel universe .
can you pass me my bag ?
em , didn &apos;t you get that yesterday ?
you &apos;ve used a lot .
it works .
good morning .
is there enough coffee for , uh ...
well , i would &apos;ve made more if i knew that you ...
the decision to stay over was spur of the moment .
your mom and i stretched happy hour until the whole night
and she didn &apos;t want me to drive .
yeah , dad , you don &apos;t have to explain .
you used to live here , remember ?
morning . come join the party .
i thought you said you didn &apos;t have to be anywhere
until 10 you were gonna sleep in .
yeah , well , internal alarm clock .
some things you just can &apos;t turn off .
what &apos;s this ?
yesterday &apos;s mail . when i came home last night .
thanks , emily .
this is yours .
fancy .
who lives in baltimore ?
my dad .
i don &apos;t remember sending that .
you didn &apos;t .
it &apos;s from isabel .
you &apos;re getting married in six weeks .
save the date .
hello , spencer .
hi .
uh , may i come in ?
yeah , sure .
what are you doing here ?
i was hoping to see melissa . is she here ?
no , she &apos;s back in philadelphia .
she hasn &apos;t really been back much since the funeral .
yeah , i was hoping to attend ,
but i hadn &apos;t seen your parents
since they asked me to disappear .
so i figured my presence might be more inciting than comforting .
so you came all this way to drop off a plant ?
wasn &apos;t actually out of my way .
i just started a rotation at rosewood community .
you &apos;re back here ?
for six months .
i applied there as my number one choice
when i was engaged to your sister .
it just came through .
somebody up there has a divine sense of irony .
are the parents home ?
they &apos;re not .
um , have you ever done an autopsy ?
sorry ?
it &apos;s just this project that i have to do for school .
i need to know if a doctor can look at a head wound
and know exactly what the weapon was that caused it .
who does the autopsies down at rosewood community ?
the hospital &apos;s pathologist .
where would he keep his records ?
in the morgue where i might nap today
if i don &apos;t get a coffee .
do you mind i have one ? i &apos;m knackered .
i &apos;m sorry , i really need to get to school .
all right , well , let me take you .
we could stop for something on the way .
you didn &apos;t come all this way to see melissa , did you ?
why don &apos;t we continue this over coffee ?
wren . i have a boyfriend now .
fine . how about tea ?
so what does your mom want ? i mean ,
if your dad ditches isabel , would she--
we &apos;ll figure it out .
they . them . they &apos;ll figure it out .
what time is your meet ?
three @-@ thirty .
but i &apos;m practicing during lunch .
and if i can get out of sixth period early ...
em , easy . you &apos;re already wearing more pain cream than clothes .
just save some mojo for the race .
what &apos;s wrong ?
who &apos;s he with ?
another satisfied customer , i guess .
why don &apos;t you go inside . i &apos;ll catch up with you later .
caleb ?
hey , sorry to interrupt ,
but you might not wanna be doing this on the street .
hey , ryan . ryan , wait up .
no , let him go .
you cannot be doing business .
hey , you know what , hanna ?
no more lectures on going legit .
i &apos;m not trading up for a paper hat at benny &apos;s burgers .
this is how i make my money . get over it .
hey there .
what &apos;s going on ? why are you here ?
it &apos;s my turn to teach the driver &apos;s ed class .
i &apos;m hoping i can scare kids into
watching the road instead of their cell phones .
funny , right ?
yeah , that &apos;s actually really funny .
i have to go to class .
spencer , we never finished
our conversation last night . you ran off .
i just have a lot of drama going on at my house .
is everything okay ?
it &apos;s fine .
you had a lot of questions and some strong ideas
about weapons and head wounds--
i know . i can get like that .
i &apos;m really sorry if i bothered you .
you seemed pretty distraught .
no . no , not really .
it was just something that i read in biology
got me thinking about ali &apos;s autopsy ,
but like you said , the case is closed .
so there &apos;s really nothing to worry about .
i really have to go to class .
what &apos;s up , mike ?
hey .
so is it true ?
what ?
is smash @-@ and @-@ grab your new sport ?
what &apos;s the deal , man ?
what , are you trying on new personalities or something ?
this week you &apos;re gonna be gangster ,
and next week you &apos;re crackhead ?
bite me . mike--
back off !
hey !
don &apos;t you guys have a class to get to ?
can i speak to you for a moment ?
later .
hey . i saw you race by my building .
i didn &apos;t even realize you were coming to campus today .
oh , i had to . if i don &apos;t finish this thing ,
it doesn &apos;t get fired till next friday .
hmm . and here i was hoping you &apos;d be at the potter &apos;s wheel
so i could wrap my arms around you and hum unchained melody .
i &apos;ve seen that movie . it ends sadly .
well , we could give it a happy ending .
can we do this later ?
yeah .
uh , how &apos;re things at home ?
sucky .
look , kids do stupid things .
probably one of mike &apos;s friends put him up to it .
he &apos;s broken into other houses , too .
jason caught him breaking into his house a few weeks ago .
jason ? as in ali &apos;s @-@ brother-
who @-@ sat @-@ next @-@ to @-@ me-
at @-@ the @-@ dinner @-@ that @-@ never @-@ happened @-@ jason ?
is that what you two were talking about the other night ?
yeah .
is this yours , too ? it &apos;s amazing .
jenna made that .
wow . she &apos;s talented .
so how &apos;re things shaping up between you guys ?
she dropped the class .
yeah , but before she left ,
did you guys find a way ...
no . she left
before i had the chance .
aria , why didn &apos;t you tell
me what was going on ? with your brother .
i didn &apos;t tell anybody .
it &apos;s embarrassing .
i get it . but you don &apos;t have to be embarrassed with me .
about anything .
maybe you could stop by my place later ...
sure .
i will call you .
bye .
so should i be worried about you and this jason guy ?
what ? no . no .
dad ?
how ? what ?
i wanted to surprise you after the meet .
is mom with you ?
no , she &apos;s still in texas .
i had to be in delaware for a training seminar
and they cancelled all the flights back .
some huge storm down there .
so i figured i could either sit in the airport in bethesda
or in the stands in rosewood .
you drove all the way up here ?
well , your mom said it was an important meet .
she said that you told her
that the scout from danby college is coming .
i did ?
oh , right , i did , yeah .
i &apos;m looking forward to meeting him .
what &apos;s his name again ? rabin ?
dad , i wish i &apos;d known .
don &apos;t worry , all right ?
i know you have your whole pre @-@ race routine ,
so i &apos;m not gonna hold you up . go .
but if you hear somebody screaming
in the stands like a crazy person , that &apos;s me .
go get &apos; em .
emily ?
l31 requesting a rescue ambulance unit at rosewood high school !
you &apos;re gonna be okay .
oh , god ! oh !
how can i have an ulcer ?
i thought i just pulled a muscle .
they &apos;re caused by stress , hon .
all right , and let &apos;s face it .
you leaving home , your ma moving .
well , you &apos;ve had your fair share .
what am i supposed to do now ? when can i swim again ?
that &apos;s off the table for the moment .
em , emmy , listen to me . listen to me .
if you &apos;re stressing about the danby scholarship ,
i want you to let it go , okay ?
they &apos;re not going to
withdraw the offer because you had a setback .
you don &apos;t know that .
i know that you need to rest .
you need to listen to the doctor .
i need to swim .
hey , you will , babe .
you will ... when you &apos;re ready .
do you want me to talk to this scout ?
do you have the number--
no , don &apos;t call him . i &apos;ll do it .
i don &apos;t mind . or get your ma to do it .
no , i don &apos;t wanna say anything
till i know when i can swim again , okay ?
okay . okay .
aren &apos;t ulcers something old people get ?
get that look off your face . you &apos;re gonna freak her out .
her ? what about me ? i &apos;m having déjà vu .
i spent a week in this place .
if i see another bowl of green jello ,
i &apos;m gonna puke on your shoes .
oh , god . i &apos;m gonna walk behind you .
is that aria ?
caleb . i &apos;ll just call him back later .
what &apos;s going on ?
han , are you and caleb ...
we &apos;re fine . there &apos;s just stuff going on .
like what ?
like an undercover cop
in a car following him .
why ?
i don &apos;t wanna talk about it .
you have to . you &apos;re in an elevator .
where else are you gonna go ?
does he know about the cop ?
no . i haven &apos;t told him .
why not ?
because i &apos;m still thinking things through .
what is there to think through ?
if i tell him ,
he might run , okay ?
i &apos;m not ready to lose him again .
yeah , and if the cops are really after him ,
you &apos;re gonna lose him anyway .
hey . did you just get home ?
i thought you were gonna come by the hotel
so we could grab some dinner .
i haven &apos;t had a chance .
hanna came by the bank to borrow my car .
emily is in the hospital .
what ? why ? what happened ?
she collapsed at school .
i just got an update-- it &apos;s an ulcer .
she &apos;s gonna be okay . her dad &apos;s there .
wow . poor kid .
do you want me to run you down there ?
or we could stay in , get some food .
tom ...
you should go home .
i don &apos;t want to have another meal
like breakfast this morning .
this ... i don &apos;t know what this is .
but i probably shouldn &apos;t have let you stay last night .
it &apos;s confusing to hanna , to you , to me .
it &apos;s not fair to anybody .
you &apos;re getting married ,
as the mailman so promptly reminded us this morning .
ashley .
tom , i need to be with a man who &apos;s sure of what he wants .
that was never you .
so all those muscle spasms and the pain--
that &apos;s all coming from your stomach ?
yeah , but ulcers can heal .
it &apos;s not forever , em .
yeah , but she &apos;s got a hole--
yes , there &apos;s a hole in her stomach .
moving on . where &apos;d your dad go ?
he went to the house to talk to the new tenants .
guys , i have to deal with this . i can &apos;t keep lying to him .
i guess not , not if it &apos;s eating holes in your stomach .
moving on !
hey , i &apos;m sorry . i got here as soon as i could .
i had to escape family court in my living room .
mike on trial ?
yeah , but the defendant didn &apos;t even show up .
i got your fav .
oh , she can &apos;t drink coffee .
yeah , she &apos;s got a hole in her stomach .
i &apos;ll trade it in for an herbal tea ,
unless you want us all here when your dad gets back .
she &apos;s not telling her dad .
if he finds out that the letter is fake ,
he &apos;s gonna move her to texas .
if she doesn &apos;t tell him , she &apos;s not gonna get any better .
but she doesn &apos;t have to
make up her mind right this second , okay ?
she already has .
i &apos;m telling him the truth .
it &apos;s the third floor .
you &apos;re looking for your friend emily , right ?
yeah . how did you know that she was here ?
i saw her name on the admittance chart .
they rushed her into the e.r. ,
but she &apos;s stabilized .
looks like we &apos;re going for a ride .
so how is she ? have you seen emily ?
i haven &apos;t , but she &apos;s in good hands .
i &apos;ll be popping in soon enough on rounds .
spencer , you want the third floor .
what is down there ?
kitchen , laundry , radiology ,
pathology , the morgue .
emily has a much better view .
what makes you think they know ?
last night , spencer was hammering
me with questions about the murder weapon .
whether the coroner could
tell if it was used by a man or a woman .
what did you say ?
nothing .
didn &apos;t get a chance to say anything .
she cut me off and ran home .
but then when i saw her again this morning ,
suddenly it was off her radar .
she &apos;s playing you .
i don &apos;t think so .
do they know about jason ?
i &apos;m not sure .
but they &apos;re definitely questioning
whether ian killed her .
we need to take care of this .
emily ?
oh , hi .
i thought spencer was up here .
she just went down to the cafeteria to get some soup .
what , our food ? willingly ?
how &apos;re you feeling ?
hungry . weak . scared .
are you my doctor now ?
no . just checking in .
so the good news is , the meds are working
and your stomach &apos;s on the road to recovery .
although i probably wouldn &apos;t celebrate
this weekend with a take @-@ out curry .
is there bad news ?
there is bad news .
look , emily , i know you swim competitively .
and i know the pressure
every athlete &apos;s under , to perform at their best ,
to constantly break their own records .
wait , i thought swimming didn &apos;t cause the ulcer .
it didn &apos;t , but your panels came back
with high levels of hgh in your bloodstream .
human growth hormone ? i &apos;ve never taken that .
emily , if you &apos;re using a
performance @-@ enhancing drug or any kind of steroid ,
it &apos;s going to show up in your tests .
and you need to know the perils of what you &apos;re doing .
i &apos;m not doing anything !
this is insane ! your test is wrong !
emily , these tests don &apos;t lie . and i did check twice .
i &apos;m here as a friend .
i asked your attending if i could speak to you first .
have you told my dad about this ?
i haven &apos;t . but you &apos;re a minor so he will have to know .
no , you can &apos;t . please . don &apos;t tell him this .
i could get kicked off the team ,
it &apos;d ruin any chance of a scholarship .
slow down .
please .
i &apos;ll take the test again . just don &apos;t tell my parents .
i &apos;ll speak to your attending . see what i can do .
caleb , get in !
what &apos;s going on ?
just hurry up ! get in !
i thought you wanted to catch a movie .
close the door !
or we can just be in one .
why are you dressed like that ?
psst . hey , in here .
spencer , what the hell ?
shh . talk later . you need to change .
why are you wearing
come on !
i hope that &apos;s homework you &apos;re doing .
it is .
so you wanna tell me what happened at school today
with your friend chaz ?
he &apos;s not my friend .
really ? since when ?
since i don &apos;t wanna talk about it .
okay , how about we talk about
why you didn &apos;t show up this afternoon .
ignoring this will not make it go away .
and the pirellis may not be pressing charges ,
but that doesn &apos;t mean you &apos;re off the hook with us .
we have no idea why you would break in to their house .
what is this all about ? what were you looking for ?
i wasn &apos;t looking for anything .
well , then you went through an awful lot of trouble
to get yourself in trouble .
mike , what is going on ?
i said i don &apos;t wanna talk about it !
and i said we have to !
so once again we &apos;re back on your schedule ?
should i hurry up and talk fast before you move out again ?
what is this place ?
it belongs to spencer &apos;s family .
i &apos;m guessing so does most of pennsylvania .
do they know we &apos;re here ?
nope .
so we &apos;re breaking in .
we &apos;re borrowing it . is this kindling ?
mm , not unless we wanna burn the couch .
can i help ?
so are you gonna lose the scarf and shades at some point ,
or did you bring a costume for me , too ?
caleb , there &apos;s someone following you .
what ?
i think it &apos;s a cop .
he drives a dark grey camaro .
and i &apos;ve seen him around town a lot lately .
he &apos;s definitely watching you .
you haven &apos;t noticed him ?
no .
but then again , i guess i kinda stopped looking .
have you been followed before ?
does this have to do with the stuff you did in allentown ?
maybe .
look , i &apos;ve already told you way more than you need to know .
what does he want ?
i mean , if he wants to arrest you , what &apos;s he waiting for ?
what does he think you did ?
i don &apos;t know .
but if he has a question to ask me ,
he needs to come up and ask me .
i &apos;m not hiding .
well , maybe you should be .
your business isn &apos;t exactly in the yellow pages .
this is why you brought me here ?
i thought it might be safer here .
i don &apos;t wanna hide .
hanna , i &apos;ll deal with this .
by leaving town again ?
this time ? no , i won &apos;t .
you say that now , but you will .
hanna ...
i am not going anywhere .
but if you do , can i come with you ?
i &apos;ll pack really fast .
seriously , you know that i &apos;m good at camping .
oh , uh , can you leave that ? i haven &apos;t eaten yet .
sure .
thank you .
your pain cream ?
a is in your medicine cabinets too ? this has to be a new record .
how long has this been in your system ?
did it damage any organs ?
forget my organs ! it &apos;s on my medical chart !
it &apos;s ruined my life ! i can never swim again !
emily , medical records are private .
not from your parents !
what &apos;re you gonna tell your dad ?
i &apos;m gonna tell him to get me out of here .
take me to texas . i &apos;m done .
it can &apos;t get worse than this .
emily , remember , &quot; a &quot; tried to plow down hanna with a car .
is that supposed to make me feel better ?
i &apos;m just saying that &quot; a &quot;
tried to take one of us down and it didn &apos;t work .
spencer , &quot; a &quot; is taking us down . one at a time .
aria &apos;s probably next .
can we all go to texas ?
no ! stop it !
we &apos;re not giving in to this freak !
look , we are this close to finding out what happened to alison .
and if &quot; a &quot; is the one that killed her-
and ian .
yeah , and then &quot; a &quot; is gonna be the one to leave rosewood , not us .
hi . sorry to interrupt .
no worries .
uh , we actually just have to get back to work .
when did you two start volunteering for the hospital ?
today &apos;s actually our first day . we &apos;re still on hour one .
we &apos;ll take this for you .
see you later .
bye .
how &apos;s everything at the house ?
good .
i found the manual to the alarm system , changed the password .
but i told them ,
&quot; you &apos;re in rosewood , you can relax . &quot;
it &apos;s mostly for show anyway .
you feel any better ?
yeah , a little .
dad , um , i &apos;ve been thinking--
so have i. and i called ma .
this whole scholarship thing-
it &apos;s not worth it , emmy .
we don &apos;t want you driving yourself to more ulcers or worse .
the hell with danby .
you swim because you love to .
or don &apos;t .
dad--
baby , we can find another way to pay for college .
and i know that there are dozens of schools out there
that would be thrilled to have you , in or out of the pool .
we just want you to be happy , baby .
that &apos;s it .
oh , it &apos;s freezing in here .
yeah , be thankful for that .
aria , hey , focus .
i can &apos;t do this .
no , you &apos;re not doing anything , okay ?
i am . just watch the door .
what is that ? cookies ?
how can anybody eat cookies in here ?
they stay fresh .
okay , there &apos;s gotta be some kind of system .
here , this is it .
they &apos;ve got autopsies in here dating back to 2007 .
okay , d ...
dehaven , delmore ,
dilaurentis . alison .
hi , honey . how &apos;s emily ?
she &apos;s good . she &apos;s coming home tomorrow , i think .
what are you doing ?
cleaning .
you &apos;re tossing everything you bought for dad . where is he ?
he went back home . he &apos;s gonna call you .
well , what happened ?
it was time for him to go .
did you guys have a fight ?
no .
well , then why would he go back to isabel ?
because he loves her and he &apos;s going to marry her .
no , he doesn &apos;t .
he &apos;s been fighting with her .
he wants to be with you .
hanna ...
no .
i saw the two of you act like you were on a honeymoon ,
sipping wine on the patio , slow dancing , laughing .
i heard you . he slept over last night !
yes , he did .
and i realized this morning
that my week of magical thinking is over .
why ? what did he do wrong ?
you were the one who said , &quot; things change , people grow . &quot;
they do .
i have .
i &apos;m not sure that your father has .
i started to know what isabel
must &apos;ve felt like when he was still married to me .
who cares about isabel ?
honey , i &apos;m not going to lie to you .
your father and i were both ... indulging in a fantasy .
but that &apos;s all it was .
he &apos;s made a commitment to somebody else .
well , he can un @-@ commit !
do you wanna be with him or not ?
because i thought that &apos;s what you wanted !
no , i don &apos;t .
i &apos;m sorry . i know that &apos;s not what you wanna hear .
do you understand any of this ? &quot; occipital fontanelle &quot; ?
it &apos;s this part of your skull .
look who i &apos;m talking to .
were you pre @-@ med in pre @-@ school ?
no , there &apos;s a lot in here that i don &apos;t understand .
oh , wait , wait , wait , here is the summary page .
&quot; the impact on the posterior of the victim &apos;s cranium ... &quot;
back of her head .
&quot; indicates she was facing away from the assailant . &quot;
they got her from behind . she was ambushed .
or running away .
trying to escape .
&quot; the cranium was displaced inward upon impact ... &quot;
what does that mean ?
it means she was hit so hard ,
they dented her skull .
&quot; and the weapon was most likely a curved , blunt edge . &quot;
like a field hockey stick .
yeah , like the one that ali borrowed from me ?
the one that jason most likely buried in my backyard .
just keep reading .
what ? what does it say ?
there was dirt in her lungs .
what do you mean ?
it means that she was breathing in dirt when she died .
that the blow to her head isn &apos;t what killed her .
i don &apos;t understand .
aria ...
alison was buried alive .
hey ! stop !
is there a problem ?
yeah , there &apos;s a problem .
you stalking caleb is a problem .
he knows why you &apos;re here .
really ?
yeah , and he &apos;s not going back .
he &apos;s finally got his life together
and you &apos;re not gonna pull it apart .
i don &apos;t know who you are or what you want ,
but there are people in this town who love him and will protect him .
so i don &apos;t think you &apos;re gonna get
what you want by spying on him .
so get lost .
you took this ?
we &apos;re gonna give it back .
just look at the summary page .

aria doesn &apos;t want to hear this ,
but jason is looking worse and worse .
is there anything i can do ?
no . no , we &apos;re just here keeping her company .
so you think you &apos;re going straight home from here ?
i mean , if you &apos;re up for company ,
you could stop by my place .
you need to get that ?
what ? no . no , it &apos;s just my dad .
ah , i should probably get home after this .
they &apos;re pretty worried .
oh . okay .
another night ?
of course . just tell me when .
i &apos;m telling you , he knows i &apos;m tailing him .
i &apos;m sorry , but it looks like he doesn &apos;t want to see you .
