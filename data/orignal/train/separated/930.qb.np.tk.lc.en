bree &apos;s affair with her contractor broke new ground .
perhaps we could make you dinner .
like a date ?
i can &apos;t wait till i ow up so i can have beautiful things .
gaby doted on her biological daughter grace .
looking who &apos;s missing her big sister .
lynette had too much on her hands .
get me a nanny .
susan found that keeping her new job a secret ...
my partners ... are not gonna eat the cost .
$ 9,000 ?
was going to be expensive .
but her secret had already been discovered .
emma graham was an ordinary woman .
and like most ordinary women ,
she had an extraordinary dream .
she wanted her husband to know she was more than just a wife .
she wanted her daughter to know
she was more than just a mother .
she wanted her neighbors to know
she was more than just the woman who lived next door .
so emma made a decision
to turn her dream into reality .
i wanna do a cabaret show .
i &apos;ll need a band , orchestrations ,
and sound equipment , and you are gonna pay for all of it .
and that is how emma graham &apos;s friends and neighbors came to gather
at the smokehouse lounge two weeks later .
they would soon learn
emma graham wasn &apos;t so ordinary after all .
yes , emma &apos;s dream of sharing her talent
had finally come true .
unfortunately , the high note that ended the evening ...
did not come from emma .
i &apos;m gonna kill you !
you whore !
okay , ladies , please !
my nose , my nose . aah !
she knew what she was doing was wrong .
she knew it was very dangerous .
she knew the risks if people found out .
but susan delfino was determined
to get back to wisteria lane ,
and that is how her world began to fall apart .
hi . i &apos;m tanya .
thank you for choosing to spend time with me .
i &apos;m all yours for the next hour .
how about we start
by getting to know each other a little better ?
show me your jugs .
aren &apos;t you ... a frisky little ... ooh !
i see some dirt under the coffee table .
would you like me to vacuum ?
sure , right after you take out those tots and shake &apos; em .
slow down .
we &apos;ve got , um ...
59 more minutes together .
and , uh ...
isn &apos;t it sexier to warm each other up
with some ... naughty talk first ?
i have to listen to my old lady &apos;s
blah @-@ blah @-@ blah all day long .
lose the top so i can see those money @-@ makers .
what , are you reading from a boob thesaurus ?
come on .
isn &apos;t there some romantic fantasy
you &apos;d like to share with me ?
okay .
are you lactating ?
oh , pig !
you never do that .
you never pull the plug on a session !
the guy was a total perv
who clearly had serious mother issues .
you cost us a major client .
and god forbid he starts talking about this at work .
we could lose the whole city council !
i &apos;m sorry .
i lost my nerve .
susan , i can &apos;t keep giving you chances like this .
va @-@ va @-@ va @-@ broom .
oh , you want a private session with tanya .
i &apos;m sorry . that &apos;s not gonna happen .
she doesn &apos;t work for me anymore .
oh , once again , i am so sorry .
i forgot that french restaurant was so formal .
next time , i will pick a place with fewer forks .
yeah , thanks again for helping me out with that .
well , i ... i had a lot of fun .
good night .
keith ?
did you really have a lot of fun ?
yeah . why do you ask ?
well , because it &apos;s our third date , and you just
kissed me like you were saying good night to your aunt .
i &apos;m trying to treat you like a lady .
oh , that &apos;s sweet .
now knock it off .
three times ?
in one night .
oh , my god . three times is my entire september .
i just had the nicest chat with grace .
she said the cutest thing .
bree had sex three times last night .
oh , screw my story . tell me everything .
the sex was amazing .
it was like ... oh , how to describe it ?
an opera .
you fell asleep during it ?
i &apos;m telling you , making love to a man in his 30s--
it &apos;s like--oh , the--the sun shines brighter ,
the grass looks greener , food tastes better .
okay , we get it . you had sex three times .
three !
oh , hey , look . renee &apos;s back from new york .
oh , god , you invited her ?
what , now you don &apos;t like renee ?
i know she &apos;s your friend ,
but isn &apos;t she kind of a self @-@ absorbed ,
narcissistic diva ?
good point . we already have one of those .
drop the drugstore champagne , ladies ,
and make way for the real stuff .
we are celebrating !
what &apos;s the occasion ?
oh , my divorce settlement .
i just soaked my ex for ... well , a whole lot of these .
i thought there was a prenup .
yep , there was , but no prenup is a match
for the legal team of grind &apos;em ,
screw &apos;em , and rothenberg .
that was iced tea .
well , i just made it fun .
now i wanna have you all over for dinner tonight .
i &apos;ve got two more cases of champagne ,
a truckload of caviar , and a pile of money
to roll around naked in . what do you say ?
if there &apos;s more of this , i am definitely there .
great . how about you , bree ?
oh , i wish i could , but i have a date .
i need to carbo @-@ load .
i &apos;ve gotta pass , too . we still haven &apos;t found a nanny ,
and so tom &apos;s working late , so i have to go--
yawn . susan .
i would , but it &apos;s macaroni and coupon clipping night
at my house .
yawn and sad . well , i guess it &apos;s just you and me .
gaby and renee .
that is great .
we were just talking about how much you two have in common .
weren &apos;t we , gabs ?
thanks so much . your baby &apos;s really cute .
it was nice meeting you . we &apos;ll let you know .
thanks .
well ? any luck finding a nanny ?
no . i &apos;ve interviewed eight girls .
they &apos;re all either too inexperienced
or too expensive .
hmm . what about the one with the boobs ?
and that &apos;s why we &apos;re not hiring her .
well , don &apos;t give up yet ,
because i found us one more applicant .
you did ? you took the initiative ?
why so surprised ?
our christmas lights are still up from last year .
and not only is she punctual , she &apos;s early .
who is it ?
um , let me put it this way .
lynette , remember how you always used to hate yams ?
but then you gave them a second chance
and they weren &apos;t so bad . and over time ,
you realized , &quot; i like yams . yams are great . &quot;
well , sometimes , lynette , people are like yams .
what &apos;d you do ?
are you insane ?
i was talking to her last night .
i @-@ i mentioned we might need help , and she volunteered .
you get it .
tommy !
mom !
why couldn &apos;t she have been a yam ?
okay , so this tina--
was that the first time he cheated on you ?
uh , i don &apos;t know . you hear stories .
there was this thing during the all @-@ star game--
pictures of doug in the tabloids with a cocktail waitress .
but then he came back with a bulgari bracelet ,
so we never talked about it .
god , being married to a pro athlete--
it must be a nightmare .
well , sounds like you are well rid of him .
you know , i feel like you get me , gaby .
and you know why ? because ...
we &apos;re both extremely beautiful .
god bless you for having the courage to say that .
only someone who looks like us
can understand what a burden it can be .
actually , it &apos;s pretty awesome .
oh , you know , sometimes i drive fast on purpose
just to see if i can flirt my way out of a ticket .
amateur hour .
i got a bank manager to shave a point off our mortgage
by bending over to pick up a pencil .
to this day , carlos calls it my million @-@ dollar ass .
wait . i can top that .
yesterday these babies earned me a cool $ 8 million .
what do you mean ?
well , i wore a lut dress to my settlement hearing ,
and afterwards , doug &apos;s lawyer came to my hotel
to renegotiate .
you slept with him ? you &apos;re awful .
i know .
i shouldn &apos;t have told you that .
keep it to yourself .
oh , honey , i won &apos;t tell anyone .
um ... i don &apos;t know you well enough .
you &apos;ve gotta give me some dirt on you .
i can &apos;t think of anything .
really ? nothing ?
like , say ... plastic surgery ?
what ?
honey , a scalpel has never touched this body .
maybe not the body ...
but that nose is a dr . brotski .
i &apos;d know his work anywhere .
how dare you . i am insulted .
okay , fine . i was 19 . it was just a little bump .
that &apos;s what they all say .
did you have a deviated septum , too ?
don &apos;t tell anyone . carlos knows ,
but if the girls find out , i &apos;d never hear the end of it .
of course . you can trust me .
i &apos;m beautiful .
that &apos;s true .
good morning .
good morning , sweetheart . mwah .
still not speaking to you .
your breakfast will be ready in a minute .
you want coffee . i &apos;ll get it .
your scrambled eggs are ready .
oh , mom , i was hoping for your french toast .
she made you eggs , tom . eat them .
no , it &apos;s no problem . you read your paper ,
and i &apos;ll fix it right up , rodney .
uh , tommy , mom .
oh , didn &apos;t i say that ?
oh , it &apos;s just that you look so much like your father .
oh , gosh , what now ?
oh , let me get her .
it &apos;s what i &apos;m here for .
would you look at that ?
my mother is on top of it ,
and you get to sit and have coffee with the man
that you kicked three times &quot; in your sleep &quot; last night .
look , i can take your mother in small doses ,
but her living here every day--
you know , i never got what this thing is
you have with her . i mean , you say you love her .
she &apos;s great with the kids . what &apos;s your beef ?
okay , you really wanna know what it is ?
yeah .
okay . i can &apos;t stand the person she turns you into .
you become this neanderthal ...
pfft . while she &apos;s tripping over her apron strings
to serve you . so she likes to dote on me ,
and i don &apos;t mind the attention . what &apos;s the big deal ?
false alarm . she &apos;s fine .
thank you .
oh , and by the way ...
more coffee .
yes .
right away .
just know if you ever
hold your coffee cup up to me ,
you will be tapping it with a stump .
mike . i was gonna call you . i was talking to paul young .
he and the new missus are really enjoying the house .
are they ?
yeah , and paul was wondering if you would be interested
in selling the place .
he &apos;s willing to make a very generous offer .
lee , i never kicked your ass
for renting our house to that guy
&apos;cause you didn &apos;t know our history , but now you do .
so i gotta wonder , are you an idiot ?
i &apos;m sorry . paul wanted me to ask .
susan and i are working really hard to save money .
you tell paul that the day his lease is up ,
we &apos;re moving home .
hello ?
hey , it &apos;s me . i just ran into mike .
did you ask him about the house ? yeah .
he wasn &apos;t interested .
did you tell him i &apos;m willing to pay above market value ?
i could have , but i didn &apos;t want to get punched .
you disappoint me , lee .
there are other houses , paul .
no . i need this one .
fortunately , i have another way to handle this .
your deposit should clear on monday ,
and this will be your balance .
wait . this isn &apos;t right .
we should have a lot more money in here .
yes . the silver bracelet that you cleaned last year
that belonged to my grandmother .
what do you think it &apos;s worth ?
okay . um ...
yeah , i &apos;ll come by tomorrow .
hi . here &apos;s that gold necklace you lent me .
what do you need it for ? you guys going on a fancy date ?
no . i just , uh ...
just needed it back .
you okay ?
you want to talk about something ?
i can &apos;t .
um ... i &apos;m gonna-- i &apos;m gonna find you a tissue .
susan , i was just at the bank .
we &apos;re missing $ 9,000 from our checking account .
you went to the bank ?
what the hell &apos;s going on ? did you take that money out ?
yes .
susan ?
susan , what happened to that money ?
she lent it to me .
w @-@ we had some bills from paige &apos;s birth
that weren &apos;t covered by insurance ,
and susan very kindly offered to help us out .
that &apos;s right .
and she &apos;s gonna pay it back by ... by friday .
with interest .
or not ... because , i mean , we &apos;re friends ,
so ... why would you charge us interest ?
i gotta get back to work ...
in case any of our other friends need money .
thank you so much .
you &apos;re so welcome .
anything you wanna tell me ?
yeah .
but promise you won &apos;t yell ?
you did porn on the internet ? !
no , it was just cleaning in lingerie .
i--there--i was never naked . there was no sex .
well , unless the guys were watching for cleaning tips ,
it &apos;s porn . susan ! how could you do this ? !
look , i feel bad enough already .
well , you should ! what if mike finds out ? or your kids ?
hey , it is really easy for you to come down here
from your 5 @-@ bedroom house in the suburbs and criticize me .
i am not on wisteria lane anymore .
look at what mike and i are trying to climb out of !
we can &apos;t even afford hot lunches for m.j. at school ,
so just think about that next time you wanna judge me .
okay .
done judging . back to being a friend .
i &apos;m sorry you had to do that .
me , too .
doug , what are you doing here ?
i had to see you .
well , i &apos;d invite you in , but it &apos;s late and i hate you .
baby , i flew all this way . at least hear me out .
if it &apos;s about the settlement ,
you &apos;re wasting your breath .
i miss you .
well , how does tina feel about that ?
that was a stupid mistake , and it &apos;s over .
i know i screwed up ...
big this time .
give me another chance .
i &apos;m sorry , doug , but i &apos;m actually happy here .
i &apos;m getting a fresh start , making new friends .
come on . can &apos;t be happy here in mayberry .
you were made for manhattan .
oh , by the way . cartier called .
they miss you , too .
oh , doug , don &apos;t do this to me .
think about everything we had together .
i want it back .
don &apos;t you ?
oh , i can &apos;t stop thinking about that play .
what do you think the angel represented
when he flew down in the middle of the night ?
i don &apos;t know . i was too busy looking for the wires .
so , are you , uh , in the mood for some dessert ?
totally .
i think the angel symbolized hope
or a @-@ a second chance at redemption , perhaps .
&apos;course , another interpretation , i suppose ,
could be--
oh , my .
when you said &quot; dessert , &quot; i just assumed ...
well , there &apos;s no two ways to interpret that .
ohh ! that was incredible .
where did you learn to do that , and why the hell am i asking ?
don &apos;t tell me . mmm .
oh , let &apos;s just say you inspire me .
well , that &apos;ll teach me
to let you walk behind me up the stairs .
what is that ?
i guess inspiration struck again .
please tell me you &apos;re here to stab me .
what ?
nothing . come on in .
what &apos;s that ?
crudites .
aren &apos;t they supposed to be sliced and peeled ?
i &apos;m too tired .
please get that away from me .
i guess someone was with keith last night .
were you once , twice , three times not a lady ?
it &apos;s not funny . six hours we had sex .
i feel like the holland tunnel .
honey , why don &apos;t you just tell him
you need a little break ?
because he &apos;s young .
if i turn down a roll in the hay , he &apos;s gonna think i &apos;m an old woman .
you just said &quot; roll in the hay . &quot; i think that ship has sailed .
ohh ! well , i better figure out how to slow him down
before this john wayne walk becomes permanent . coming !
come on in .
hey , girls .
you are just in time .
i mixed up a signature drink in honor of your divorce .
i wouldn &apos;t pour that just yet .
i &apos;m starting to rethink this whole divorce thing .
doug showed up last night .
he flew in from new york ?
i know . he said it &apos;s over with tina .
he wants me back .
and he gave me this .
oh , doug screws up a lot ,
but his apologies are always the 4th of july .
wow . tom &apos;s apologies are more like arbor day .
but he cheated on you .
okay . a guy who has women throwing themselves at him
in every city .
meanwhile , we had ten great years ,
and he loved me and cared for me and i think i should
give him another chance .
am i crazy ?
well , you have invested ten years in the marriage .
no one goes that long without a few bumps in the road .
okay , then . i &apos;m doing it .
are you insane ?
the man dumped you for another woman .
well , he apologized . can &apos;t i forgive him ?
why ? because he gave you a stupid ring ?
he &apos;s buying you off again . open your eyes .
hey . it &apos;s my marriage anyway .
why don &apos;t you just keep your fake nose out of it ?
what does she mean , fake ?
gabrielle solis , did you have a nose job ?
hello ! we &apos;re talking about trampy mctrinket !
after all these years of you
bragging about your natural beauty ?
oh , i never brag .
you once called your face proo god &apos;s existence .
you said i was a fraud for wearing a padded swimsuit .
and now we find out you &apos;ve had plastic surgery .
ooh ! that changes everything .
no , it doesn &apos;t . it wasn &apos;t plastic surgery .
it was corrective rhinoplasty for a deviated ...
you will regret this .
oh , gaby , come on ! we &apos;re kidding !
don &apos;t get your nose out of joint .
&lt; i &gt; bree van de kamp had a problem . &lt; / i &gt;
her boyfriend &apos;s sexual appetite was proving to be exhausting .
and then out of the blue , bree came up with a solution .
since keith &apos;s demands were overwhelming her ,
why not make some overwhelming demands of her own ?
wow . there &apos;s a lot of work here .
i guess i could get it done by friday .
oh , no , i &apos;m gonna need it sooner than that .
certainly by tonight .
hey , allison made you
your favorite cookies for your trip .
macaroons ? !
oatmeal raisin .
oh . those were my dad &apos;s favorites .
maybe you can trade them with the boy next to you on the plane for his snack .
make fun , but you have to admit ,
she &apos;s been great with the baby .
she has been great . you were right . i was wrong .
oh , if only these were macaroons .
this would be the best day of my life .
call me when you land .
see you , babe .
ah . so can i help with the lasagna ?
actually , the boys said they wanted meatloaf ,
so i switched the menu . now sit .
all right .
so tom was telling me about you going back to work .
i must say , i don &apos;t understand that .
well , that &apos;s ...
okay .
what are you doing ?
i &apos;m out of milk .
well , your grandmother is not here to serve you .
i don &apos;t mind , dear .
see ? she wants to .
soda , gram ?
make it two .
boys !
penny , i have to get the meat , so you get the sodas .
uh ... why ?
why ? we have to take care of our men .
penny , sit .
you boys want a drink , get up and get it .
they had such a long day ,
classes and then their after @-@ school sports .
allison , in this house , the women don &apos;t wait on the men .
the men get off their asses and help themselves .
when did it become a sin to take care of your family ?
oh , you modern women . you just plop out a baby ,
and then you can &apos;t wait to get back to your silly careers .
i took care of my boys .
when my husband came home ,
there was a hot meal waiting for him on the table .
he never wanted for anything .
yeah , and how did that work out for you ?
he had an affair and left .
damn it .
i didn &apos;t realize you were still here .
have you been working this whole time ?
you said to get it all done today .
so if there is nothing else ,
i would like to go home and slip into a coma .
why don &apos;t you spend the night here ?
i &apos;d hate to see you out there driving
when you &apos;re so exhausted .
you are exhausted , right ?
totally .
every part of my body hurts .
then stay .
sleep here .
in the morning , i will make you ...
belgian waffles .
that will be my special thank you
for all of your hard work .
what are you doing ?
i thought of another way you could thank me .
you said every part of your body was sore .
one part &apos;s doing okay .
okay !
that &apos;s it !
what &apos;s wrong ?
i can &apos;t do it ! i can no longer keep up
with you and your woody woodpecker sex drive !
what ?
i @-@ i &apos;m just gonna say it , okay ?
i &apos;m older than you .
i don &apos;t have your stamina , and i can &apos;t keep up .
you-- you can &apos;t keep up ?
i &apos;m dating a woman who talks to waiters in french
and wants to discuss a play &apos;s
symbolism during halftime .
intermission .
you see ? you &apos;re ten times smarter than me .
that &apos;s why i keep sexing you up .
i &apos;m trying to keep you interested .
make no mistake . i am interested .
i love when i am prattling on about the meaning of the angel ,
you notice the wires .
you have your own way of seeing the world ,
and it &apos;s fun and down @-@ to @-@ earth
and everything i &apos;m not .
so you &apos;re saying you like me how i am ?
wow . i hadn &apos;t thought of that .
yes .
very much .
now put that thing away
and let &apos;s get some rest .
hi . who are you ?
oh , i &apos;m jenny . i &apos;m the new nanny .
ah ! isn &apos;t it great ?
i offered her a little more money , and she took the job .
she &apos;s the one with the boobs . remember ?
yeah .
you &apos;re welcome .
lynette , can i--can i talk to you upstairs for a minute ?
okay .
i &apos;ll be right up .
oh . okay .
so ...
great news about jen , huh ?
yeah .
i just fired her .
what ? you had no right to do that .
and you had no right
to make my mother feel unwelcomed in my house .
she just wanted to be a part of this family .
tom , i love your mother ,
and if this were 1955,
i would be so on board with her parenting techniques ,
but i will not let her raise our children
to turn out like ...
whoa , whoa . finish that sentence . t @-@ turn out like me ?
no . no , i didn &apos;t say that ! i--
but we--let &apos;s be honest .
when we first met ,
you thought there were only two roles for women--
making a cake or jumping out of one .
i &apos;m sorry . i just don &apos;t want her here .
for our entire marriage ,
you have been the one to make the decisions .
&quot; i &apos;m going back to work . &quot; &quot; i &apos;m hiring a nanny . &quot;
this time , i am making the decision . she stays .
okay , boys and girls , gather up your supplies and put them away .
see you tomorrow .
maxine , i can &apos;t talk now .
i &apos;m at work .
look , i know i fired you ,
but if you like ,
i &apos;m willing to offer you , uh , another chance .
why ?
well , this guy keeps calling .
he really wants a private session with you ,
and he &apos;s starting to offer some serious money .
come on . what do you say ?
how serious are we talking ?
thank you so much for coming .
i cannot tell you what it means to me .
yeah , yeah . are you gonna be singing any songs
about a woman who &apos;s a backstabbing bitch ?
we are really looking forward to it , emma .
good luck .
thanks .
would you get over it already ?
why don &apos;t we go sit down with our friends ?
no !
i &apos;m sick of lynette making those
cyrano de bergerac jokes ,
whoever she was .
he . and , baby , they are just teasing you .
well , it &apos;s not funny . my thing was my natural beauty .
like susan &apos;s an artist . lynette &apos;s a great businesswoman .
bree &apos;s the perfect homemaker .
i was the beautiful one .
now i &apos;m just the plastic one .
and there &apos;s the woman who &apos;s to blame .
man , i &apos;d love to smack that smile right off her face--
which , by the way , has been pulled so tight ,
it would probably smack me back .
i forgot what it was like walking into a room on your arm .
i like it .
baby , i think you are the one they were staring at .
ah . well , this doesn &apos;t hurt .
hey , gaby .
i didn &apos;t nose you &apos;d be here .
okay , i don &apos;t know what you heard , but it &apos;s all crap .
don &apos;t lie .
that &apos;ll make it grow again .
tell doug perry it &apos;s on the house .
i &apos;ll do it .
it &apos;s on the house .
oh , by the way , she slept with your lawyer .
enjoy the show .
is that true ?
well ...
the thing about that is ...
ladies and gentlemen ,
the smokehouse lounge is proud to present
emma graham .
whoo , emma !
a word . aah !
hey ! hey ! hey ! hey ! get the claws off the versace !
why the hell would you tell him that ?
well , you know me and my big nose ...
this is my marriage we &apos;re talking about !
this trumps your stupid nose !
whatever . they &apos;re both fake !
oh , what do you know ?
you &apos;re nothing but a boring housewife ...
shut up !
whose life is so pathetic , you gotta crap all over mine !
i &apos;m pathetic ? ! hey , what do you call
a girl who sleeps with a guy for $ 8 million ? !
get off ! uhh ! aah !
i &apos;m gonna kill you !
you whore ! uhh ! get off me !
okay , ladies , please .
i will never forgive you for this !
sure you will . i &apos;ll just buy you a sapphire ring .
oh , you like my ring ?
well , get ready to smell it !
oh , my god , my nose !
my nose ! my nose !
didn &apos;t think i &apos;d hear from you again .
look , i &apos;ve been thinking about everything that &apos;s happened .
you slept with someone . i slept with someone .
maybe we should just call it even .
really ?
yeah .
i mean , that &apos;s what we both want , right ?
thank you , dear .
i am so sorry for saying those things about your husband .
i appreciate that .
and i &apos;m sorry if i ... crossed some sort of line .
it just felt so nice to feel useful again .
you are useful , and i really need you here ,
especially when i go back to work .
you know ,
the kitchen is my favorite room in the house .
the family sits together here .
you get to cook for them and make them happy .
and i just don &apos;t understand
why you would ever want to give all that up to go out there .
it &apos;s just who i am .
mom ? the baby &apos;s crying .
oh . well , she &apos;s probably hungry .
ooh . yummy .
i &apos;m so sorry . what &apos;s your name again ?
i &apos;m penny .
and do you live here ?
i &apos;m not really used to apologizing ...
but here are some chocolates .
i haven &apos;t touched a carb since 1985,
but thank you .
believe it or not ,
i was actually on my way over to apologize to you .
i don &apos;t know what came over me .
look , i still feel you deserve better than that guy .
but i had no right to screw with your marriage . it &apos;s your life .
doug called this morning .
he said he still wants me back ...
and i said no .
seriously ?
he said we could pretend it never happened ,
and i thought of all the things
i pretended never happened over the years .
you were right , gaby . i needed to open my eyes .
okay , well , before i take credit for this ,
are you sure this is what you want ?
yes .
and thank you . out of all the women ,
you were the only one who had the guts to tell me the truth .
you &apos;re a real friend ,
and i &apos;ll take that over a sapphire ring any day .
you &apos;re keeping the ring , right ?
oh , hell , yeah .
hello ?
is anyone there ?
are you shy , too ?
well , that &apos;s okay . so am i.
why don &apos;t you start with just , uh ,
telling me your name ?
i think you know my name .
i &apos;m still here , susan .
i &apos;m glad you put your robe on .
i hate to see you debasing yourself .
what do you want ?
i &apos;d like your house ,
and i &apos;m willing to pay a very fair price for it .
yeah , mike told me about that .
it &apos;s not for sale .
susan , it seems to me a lot of things are for sale--
your body , your honor ,
your reputation .
the house would seem to be the smallest of those things .
are you threatening me ?
i &apos;m simply saying it would be terribly unfortunate
if anyone were to find out what i already know .
i mean ... i was shocked .
i can only imagine
what your husband and son would think .
you son of a bitch .
it &apos;s a lot to take in , i know .
why don &apos;t you take a couple of days to think about it ?
i &apos;d hate for you to feel that i was ... pressuring you .
he knew what he was doing was wrong .
he knew it was very dangerous .
he knew the risks if people found out .
but paul young wanted to punish those who had betrayed him .
so he had a plan that would set neighbor against neighbor
and friend against friend .
