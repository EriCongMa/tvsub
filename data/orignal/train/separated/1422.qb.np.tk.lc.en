how could we don &apos;t have the same number of containers and lids ?
why would they ever get separated ?
built @-@ up resentment , money issues ,
met a younger lid .
mom , where &apos;s my science homework ?
uh , it &apos;s over there on the table .
so , alex , honey , what &apos;s going on ?
anything exciting ?
no .
any boys ?
no .
i &apos;m feeling a little bit disconnected
from alex right now .
last week , i picked up her cellphone ,
thinking it was mine .
and i accidentally read a few flirty text messages
that were probably from a boy in her class ,
which is fine .
or they &apos;re from a drifter .
come on , isn &apos;t there something
you want to share with your mommers ?
yeah . don &apos;t call yourself &quot; mommers . &quot;
he blew his lid when she tried to contain him .
okay . what do you think ?
i like it .
but you don &apos;t love it .
no , i do . i love it .
as much as you loved the other one ?
ooh .
okay . mm .
the house is on fire . i only have time to grab one shirt .
which one do i take ?
the correct answer is take lily .
after that .
uh , okay , the blue one .
because the gray one washes me out .
no , no . cam , you -- you can &apos;t go wrong here .
everything you &apos;ve tried on looks great .
i love you in both of them .
oh , you &apos;re so nice to me .
mitchell has a problem with public displays of affection .
um , i remember once at a new year &apos;s eve party ,
stroke of midnight , he high @-@ fived me .
two problems with that --
one , gays don &apos;t high @-@ five .
two , gays don &apos;t high @-@ five .
i &apos;m home !
mmm , what smells so good ?
i &apos;m making chunchullo , a traditional colombian dish ,
for dinner with the family tonight .
chunchullo .
what is that -- like , uh , tacos ?
yes , like tacos .
no , it isn &apos;t .
it &apos;s the small intestine of a pig .
oh , geez .
why can &apos;t we eat regular food like normal people ?
i told you , jay .
my grandmother , who rests in peace ,
has been coming to me in my dreams ,
telling me that i &apos;m losing touch with my roots .
see , this is awkward ,
because my dead uncle joe told me to have steak tonight .
no , no , no , jay . have some respect .
my grandmother can hear you .
what do you mean , she can hear us ?
well , in our culture ,
we believe that the dead are all around us .
she &apos;s right , manny .
she could be right here ,
her bony fingers reaching out from the grave .
yeah , keep it up , jay .
there &apos;s already one dead person in this room .
you want to make it two ?
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;ve got a printer to install .
oh , gloria , have your grandmother
run me up an iced tea in about 10 minutes .
yeah , she has a better chance of making that work than you !
why don &apos;t you save us the stomping and the swearing and call phil ?
he &apos;s good at that stuff .
better than me ?
phil &apos;s not better than me at anything ,
except maybe making that stupid sound with his mouth .
a what , what
you spit on me .
haley , honey , um , i need you to do something for me .
ugh . mom , my arm hurts .
why don &apos;t you find out what it is
before you start making up excuses to get out of it ?
okay , what is it ?
i need you to talk to your sister .
i think that there &apos;s something going on with her and a boy .
so ?
so , i am your mother , and it is my job to make sure
that you girls don &apos;t get involved with a predator .
okay , mom , stop watching &quot; dateline . &quot;
and why can &apos;t you just talk to her ?
i have tried to talk to her .
i -- she won &apos;t talk to me . you know that .
that &apos;s because you get so weird every time a boy comes near us .
i @-@ i just don &apos;t want you girls to --
to make the same mistakes that you did ?
no !
no .
mom , i &apos;m not an idiot .
i pick up on things .
and i don &apos;t think that you were the good girl
you pretend you were .
wow . that is so untrue .
i was a very good girl . mm .
your kids don &apos;t need to know
they need to know who you wish you were ,
and they need to try to live up to that person .
they &apos;re gonna fall short ,
but better they fall short of the fake you
than the real you .
which is why we don &apos;t hide anything .
that &apos;s the opposite of what i just said .
i was not listening .
i &apos;ll say it again -- i love you in paisley .
oh , let me lock the door and draw the curtains .
what does that mean ?
it doesn &apos;t mean anything .
good .
you know exactly what it means .
you won &apos;t kiss me in front of other people
because you &apos;re ashamed of who you are .
and , yes ... i went there .
okay , you can &apos;t say , &quot; yes , i went there , &quot;
when you go there all the time .
and , by the way , i &apos;m the one who makes speeches on airplanes
every time someone looks at us weird .
i &apos;m the one who gives my dad hell
when he refers to you as my &quot; friend . &quot;
that &apos;s different . that &apos;s confrontation .
but you know what takes real strength ?
whining ?
affection .
oh , this is insane .
buying a shirt -- it &apos;s not a kiss @-@ worthy moment .
oh , i didn &apos;t know there was an official list .
please , tell us -- what is on the list ?
i &apos;ll tell you what &apos;s not on the list --
finding jalapeno @-@ stuffed olives ,
making the light on maple ,
every time we see a v.w.
you don &apos;t like &quot; kiss @-@ buggy &quot; ?
it &apos;s not a real game !
it -- it &apos;s just another way for you to be needy .
i -- and i don &apos;t appreciate you making me feel bad
because i can &apos;t live up to your impossible standards .
nobody kisses at a bowling alley !
i almost got a turkey !
&quot; yello &quot; ?
oh , hey , jay . just a sec . i &apos;ll go get claire .
oh , actually , it &apos;s you i &apos;m calling .
what was that ?
the cat . there &apos;s a cat . what &apos;s up ?
well , gloria &apos;s been missing her grandmother .
i &apos;ve been trying to get this old picture of her printed ,
but i can &apos;t get this new printer to --
i &apos;ll be right there .
luke , grandpa needs us !
hells yes , i was glad to get the call .
jay &apos;s always around here fixing things ,
cracking jokes about my &quot; delicate hands &quot;
or my gag response to the smell of paint .
look who needs me now
mr. hot @-@ dog fingers who can &apos;t press &quot; print &quot;
without hitting three extra keys .
yeah !
you &apos;re in my house now , jay !
t @-@ technically , we &apos;ll be in his house ,
but we &apos;ll be in my area ...
of his house .
so , i hear you have a boyfriend .
no , i don &apos;t .
who is he ?
i &apos;m not talking to you about this .
oh , come on .
you &apos;re finally interesting . just tell me .
he &apos;s not my boyfriend .
it &apos;s jeremy reed .
it &apos;s -- he &apos;s just this boy that i --
love ?
no !
well , have you guys kissed yet ?
no !
well , what are you waiting for ?
i &apos;m not waiting . i &apos;m 13 .
and you &apos;ve never kiss boy ?
how old were you ?
like 11 .
and it was beautiful .
i was in jackson kaner &apos;s carpeted garage .
11 ?
yeah .
so you better get on it ,
or else he &apos;s gonna think you &apos;re a lesbian .
he &apos;s not going to think i &apos;m a lesbian .
i thought you were .
you totally have the sandals for it .
let &apos;s see this bad boy .
oh , a p @-@ 750 . nice unit .
i would have sprung for the 840,
but i get it --
not everyone can handle that kind of horsepower .
i thought maybe the cordless phone was interfering ,
so i unplugged it .
good idea . maybe we should run downstairs
and unplug the toaster while we &apos;re at it .
oh , snap , dad .
toaster .
we &apos;re kidding .
a cordless phone is 5.8 gigahertz . this is wi @-@ fi .
it &apos;s a totally different spectrum .
walk with me ?
here &apos;s a little trick that i &apos;ve found pretty useful with claire .
the computer and the printer must talk , talk , talk
command @-@ p &quot; makes the picture walk , walk , walk &quot;
how come it &apos;s not working ?
it should be .
okay .
uh , that should be printing .
so ...
hey , phil , i &apos;m gonna get a beer , beer , beer
before i hit you in the head , head , head .
hey . what are you doing here ?
hi , jeremy . i want to ask you something .
sure , ask
wait , don &apos;t talk yet .
here is the thing .
we &apos;ve texting for a while , and it &apos;s been nice ,
but i feel like it &apos;s leading to something else ,
and i don &apos;t know if you do or not ,
but i guess what i &apos;m trying to say is ,
i &apos;m just a girl standing in front of a boy
asking for him to like her .
oh , god , that &apos;s from &quot; notting hill . &quot;
so dorky . but a really underrated movie .
what &apos;s happening ?
i &apos;m not a lesbian .
i would like for you to kiss me .
oh , i love watching you stir .
then i will stop .
what ? are you still mad at me ?
yes . you have to apologize for making fun of my culture , my beliefs ,
my chunchullo , my abuela .
i &apos;m sorry .
if you think your grandmother &apos;s here with us ,
i respect that .
now , come here .
oh , grandma ! where &apos;d you come from ?
we &apos;re gonna have to get you a little bell .
enough , jay !
my culture is very important to me !
i &apos;ve been working all day to share it with your family tonight ,
and all you do is mock me !
just go !
honey , i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m just teasing you .
instead of being the comedian , why don &apos;t you help me ?
what do you need ?
slap the chicken .
do what ?
in colombia , when you cook in honor of the departed ,
you have to scare death away from the food
to protect the people that are gonna eat it .
slap it and yell .
that &apos;s the nuttiest --
jay !
calm down .
give me the chicken .
here we go .
that &apos;s not scaring anything away .
when my grandfather used to cook ,
the whole house would shake .
louder .
higher .
louder !
higher ! louder ! there !
i made all that up .
that is not a real custom in colombia .
we &apos;re not lunatics .
but you mess with us , and we mess with you .
that &apos;s the custom .
louder !
hey , honey . where &apos;d you go ?
nowhere . just for a bike ride .
oh , my god ! puh @-@ lease tell me this text is wrong !
did you really just go over to that kid &apos;s house
and try and kiss him in front of a million people ? !
alex , did you do that ?
you got a text ?
oh , yeah . everybody knows .
do you know how embarrassing this is for me ? !
this is all your fault !
you &apos;re the one who said i had to kiss him or i was a lesbian !
haley ! did you say that to her ? !
oh , don &apos;t turn this on me . look at her shoes !
ugh ! i &apos;m never going back to school now .
no , sweetheart . yes , you are . you are going back to school .
but listen to me-- just because a boy sends you flirty texts .
doesn &apos;t mean that
you have to text him back
what ? ! you read my texts ? !
i ...
you read her texts ? !
that &apos;s why you made me talk to her ? !
you made her talk to me ? !
i kind of feel like we &apos;re spinning out here a little bit .
look , alex , the important thing here
is that you have to be very careful how you behave around boys
because it is so easy to get a reputation .
well , i &apos;m sorry i &apos;m not a perfect little good girl like you were !
were you ?
were you ? !
i highly doubt it !
don &apos;t be such a chicken . there &apos;s no ghost in here .
i &apos;m telling you , my mom said her dead grander was in the house .
she said she felt her here this morning ...
in this room .
maybe your mom &apos;s mentally ill .
who puts a router ... in the attic ?
did she have a limp and a cane ?
ghost of manny &apos;s great @-@ grandma ,
if that &apos;s really you ,
show yourself !
that &apos;s her !
come on !
why ? !
why ? ! !
hi , grandpa.- how we doing , girls ?
mom ruined my life today .
i didn &apos;t ruin your life . i was
don &apos;t even talk to me !
i didn &apos;t even want to come here .
well , okay .
snacks and and sodas are in the living room ,
but don &apos;t fill up -- we &apos;ve got intestines coming .
uh , dad , if you &apos;re looking for your shoes ,
i think i know where they are .
this happens to be a colombian custom --
walking in the footsteps of the ancestors , blah , blah , blah .
beats slapping the chicken .
here , i brought you a drink .
oh , wait a minute --
sip it first .
i &apos;m not mad at you .
i thought about it , and maybe you &apos;re right .
i can be a little needy sometimes .
oh , well , i @-@ i appreciate that .
and you &apos;re probably not entirely off base .
i mean , lord knows i @-@ i &apos;ve got my quirks .
and i @-@ i &apos;m not the most demonstrative guy around ,
but i &apos;m -- i &apos;m working on it .
and i &apos;m gonna help you with it .
good .
just don &apos;t give up on me .
never .
okay , everybody , let &apos;s gather around !
jay , come here .
tonight we dine on the traditional colombian recipes
of my abuela , my grandmother .
and even though she &apos;s no longer with me ,
i am very happy because i have all of you .
to ana @-@ maria rosa de la immaculada jimenez morales .
to ana @-@ maria rosa ...
that was beautiful , gloria ,
just like my mitchell .
just slipped right off there .
ay , cameron , what happened ?
one moment you were there ,
the next , only shoes .
i &apos;ll tell you what happened --
mitchell is embarrassed to kiss me
in front of other people .
no , you ambushed me !
oh , cam , come on .
don &apos;t take it personally .
when mitchell was in high school ,
he was dating this girl -- robin schier .
he would never kiss her , either .
that &apos;s because i was gay .
what &apos;s your excuse now ?
ay , cameron , it &apos;s not mitch &apos;s fault .
he gets it from his father .
jay doesn &apos;t like the lovey @-@ dovey in public , either .
i can &apos;t believe you &apos;re coming at me right now .
i &apos;m standing here with shoes around my neck .
and for the better part of a half @-@ hour ,
i screamed the death out of your meat .
now , what do you want from me ?
don &apos;t you see ?
it &apos;s because of you
that your son cannot kiss his own lover .
don &apos;t say &quot; lover . &quot;
we don &apos;t like &quot; lover . &quot;
can we just eat ?
no . tell mitch
that it &apos;s okay to kiss cam in front of you .
why is that something we have to do ?
we don &apos;t .
of course we don &apos;t .
oh , i &apos;m sorry that i don &apos;t want to make out with you
in front of my whole family .
no need to apologize .
oh , gloria is right .
dad , you being so emotionally closed off
makes it very difficult for your children to show affection .
really ?
yes .
you had trouble showing affection in public places ?
yes ! - you ? -yes .
was that before or after
you were delivered to my door in a squad car ,
wearing nothing but your underwear and a police blanket ?
oh , my god . what ? you were arrested ?
awesome !
not awesome .
and i wasn &apos;t arrested .
your grandfather was just telling a joke .
it was just a joke . i got a million of &apos; em .
dad .
i did it !
it &apos;s printing !
i had to download new firmware , install new drivers ,
change your encryption , and replace an ethernet cable
in a 100 @-@ degree attic ,
while dodging particularly aggressive spiders ,
but i did it !
thanks .
oh . okay . i guess that &apos;s it .
what ? what &apos;s it ?
wake up , dummy .
this is what we &apos;re talking about .
this guy &apos;s been working like an imbecile all day for you .
people need something else -- kisses , hugs .
what , for fixing a printer ?
oh , it &apos;s fine . it was only four hours .
i tipped over a paint can and threw up a little ,
but i think -- i think &quot; thanks &quot; about covers it .
well , what &apos;s wrong with &quot; thanks &quot; ?
it &apos;s pretty much the bare minimum , dad .
jay , for god &apos;s sakes , just say something .
you want me to say something ?
how about &quot; you &apos;re welcome &quot; ?
how about &quot; i &apos;m -- i &apos;m so happy to be here for you all
so i can take the blame for all your crap . &quot;
i don &apos;t do this ,
i never did that .
trust me , i gave you twice
as much as my father ever gave me .
the man kissed me one time in my entire life .
he came up behind me , kissed me on the back of the head ,
said , &quot; goodnight , becky . &quot;
he thought i was my sister .
wait a minute .
when was the last time you kissed mitch ?
what does that have to do with anything ?
mitch , when was the last time he kissed you ?
i @-@ i don &apos;t remember .
it wasn &apos;t that long ago .
i was 12 .
12 ? this is the problem !
jay &apos;s dad doesn &apos;t kiss jay ,
so jay doe &apos;t kiss mitch , and mitch is uptight .
okay , okay , &quot; uptight &quot; was really not on the table .
this is more about kissing .
jay , kiss your son . he &apos;s a mess .
oh , come on , now .
we don &apos;t have to do that . it &apos;s ...
yes , you do . - no . - come on .
come on , do it . you &apos;re in front of your grandchildren .
all right , all right ! shut up !
mitch , get over here .
w @-@ what , now ? well , i feel weird now .
don &apos;t be coy .
what are you waiting for , a box of chocolates ?
let &apos;s do this .
that &apos;s the sweetest thing i &apos;ve ever seen .
all right , and now because i never want to hear this again .
you .
not you .
oh , daddy , i love you .
let &apos;s go eat chunchullo !
you know it &apos;s made of pig intestines , right ?
alex , wait .
what ?
i want to talk to you .
mom , i don &apos;t want another lecture .
it &apos;s not a lecture . i want to tell you something .
honey , i know exactly how you &apos;re feeling .
no , you don &apos;t .
okay , the -- the joke that grandpa told tonight ?
that -- that happened .
that ... that was true .
so , you were arrested naked ?
i wasn &apos;t naked !
and i was not arrested per se .
i was driven home one night by the police
because my boyfriend and i
had gone swimming in somebody &apos;s pool ,
and we didn &apos;t have bathing suits and -- blah , blah , blah .
the details aren &apos;t important .
what matters is that everybody at school was talking about it .
and i thought i would die .
but it passed .
i swear .
and now , honey , i &apos;m -- i &apos;m glad it happened .
i &apos;ve got a funny story to tell at dinner parties .
so , how long did it take before you thought it was funny ?
oh , god ...
10 , 15 years .
great . what do i do about tomorrow ?
i don &apos;t think you have to worry about that .
go , go , go .
in colombia , we kiss for everything ,
because a kiss can mean so many different things .
there &apos;s no ghost in here , is there ?
not a chance .
sleep easy , kid .
it can be the start of something new .
it can be how we say , &quot; this is the person that i love . &quot;
so who &apos;s a better kisser , me or your dad ?
ew .
it can be romantic .
just so you know , if my friends weren &apos;t there ,
i would &apos;ve said yes .
so , if you still want to ...
if it &apos;s okay ...
maybe we should hang out more first .
this is only the second conversation we &apos;ve had
that wasn &apos;t by text .
it can also be worth waiting for .
jay , what is this ?
just another nice thing i did for you
while you made a fool of me .
manny let me in on your little tricks .
you feel bad now ?
no . i feel good .
that one is definitely my favorite .
phil , you really don &apos;t have to do this .
no . i @-@ i can do it . i wanna do it .
it &apos;s silly to pay someone else just to do something --
oh , no ! oh !
oh , wait ! no , no , don &apos;t spill it !
sweetie , don &apos;t spill that !
oh , that &apos;s on me !
careful ! oh , gosh !
okay , get up . you &apos;re fine .
get it off !
okay , i got it .
i got it . got it off . got it off .
oh , the face !
not the face !
oh , the face !
all right ,
i &apos;ll pull it down ! you &apos;re good !
all right , i &apos;m gonna have to
it &apos;s on me .
i &apos;ll cut it off .
good idea .
