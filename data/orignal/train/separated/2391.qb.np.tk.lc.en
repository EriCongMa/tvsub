mystic falls ... i was born here .
this is my home .
and mine .
and mine .
for centuries , supernatural creatures have lived among us .
they were vampires , werewolves , doppelgangers ...
witches .
and even hybrids .
there are those who protect them .
the sheriff has a vampire for a daughter .
and our lovely mayor has a son who is half @-@ vampire , half @-@ werewolf .
and those who want them dead .
they &apos;re our friends ...
our enemies ...
the ones we love .
and the ones we &apos;ve lost .
matt , look out !
and then there &apos;s me .
i &apos;m human ...
at least i was .
stefan ... hey .
i &apos;m right here .
you &apos;ve been in and out for hours .
wh--what happened ?
you were in an accident .
oh , my god .
matt , is he-
alive ?
ask stefan , the hero .
he &apos;s fine .
thank you .
i thought that i-- how did you ...
save you ? he didn &apos;t .
when jeremy brought you to the hospital before all of this happened ,
your injuries were worse than anyone knew .
meredith fell made a choice .
she used damon &apos;s blood to heal you .
and when rebekah ran matt &apos;s truck off the road ,
you had vampire blood in your system , elena .
oh , my god .
does--does that mean that i ...
am i dead ?
no .
no , no , no !
that--that wasn &apos;t supposed to happen !
maybe it doesn &apos;t have to . i talked to bonnie .
she said she &apos;s stronger than ever .
there might be something she can do to help you .
no , the only thing that &apos;s going to help
is for you to feed and complete the transition .
we have all day before she has to feed , damon .
that &apos;s a day to exhaust every possible way out of this .
there is no way out of it !
we all know the drill-- you feed or you die .
there is no door number three .
i was ready to die .
i was supposed to die , i don &apos;t--
i don &apos;t want-- i can &apos;t be a vampire !
if there &apos;s something that bonnie can do , we have to try it .
we will . we &apos;ll try everything .
it &apos;s your choice , elena .
as always .
way to get her hopes up for something
that &apos;s never happened in the history of vampirism .
know what ? you weren &apos;t there the day elena looked me in the eye
and told me she absolutely never wanted this .
then you shouldn &apos;t have let her die .
i never meant for her to die .
she asked me to help matt first and i did .
and now the world has one more quarterback .
bravo , brother .
i made a choice
that i will regret for the rest of my life .
now let me try to fix it .
jer !
are you ok ?
i watched vickie go through this .
she was a mess . her emotions were all over the place .
all of these old memories came flooding back .
i &apos;m fine . i &apos;m not vickie .
no , you &apos;re not . you &apos;re you .
you act like everything &apos;s ok
so no one worries about you , but you need help .
i said i &apos;m fine , ok ?
i--i &apos;m sorry , i ...
have you talked to bonnie ?
yeah .
she said when i was shot ,
she made some plea to the witch spirits to bring me back .
and they listened .
yeah , but the consequences were horrible .
and what could be more horrible than you turning into a vampire ?
i need my sister .
not another one of them .
we &apos;re going to find a way out of this .
everything &apos;s going to be ok .
i hope so .
it &apos;s beautiful , isn &apos;t it ?
what is that doing here , klaus ?
the deal we made with tyler was that
you &apos;d leave his body and jump into someone else &apos;s
the first chance you got .
yes .
when i assumed i &apos;d be a pile of ash .
but apparently fate and oxygen intervened , and there i am .
put me back .
i can &apos;t right now .
your history teacher outed
tyler and caroline to the council .
they &apos;re on the war path and this body &apos;s vulnerable .
i have to help elena before she has to feed .
elena &apos;s dead and no longer my concern .
you &apos;re forgetting who just saved your life .
you &apos;re forgetting i can rip your tongue out !
now put ... me ... back .
if i can keep elena human ,
you &apos;ll still have an endless blood supply to make your hybrids .
isn &apos;t that what you really want ?
same rules apply .
no one knows . no one .
do you understand me , bonnie ?
pastor young . to what do we owe the honor ?
and don &apos;t tell me it &apos;s your blood pressure again .
honestly , dr. fell , i wish it were .
blood bank &apos;s in the basement . one of you sweep the rooms .
what are you doing ?
adding a few security measures .
the blood in this place has a habit of flying off the shelves .
who gave you that authority ?
the council .
they &apos;ve entrusted me to secure the town .
and unlike some of our founding families ,
i don &apos;t have conflicting interests .
what is that supposed to mean ?
alaric saltzman told us everything , meredith .
probably time to start looking for a new job .
elena doesn &apos;t want to be a vampire .
she doesn &apos;t want to be dead , and now she &apos;s not .
this isn &apos;t your fault , matt .
this is all my fault . i was driving .
i was saved . she &apos;s a vampire because of me !
shh ! cool it on the &quot; v &quot; word . i &apos;m a fugitive , remember ?
i &apos;m supposed to be halfway to florida by now .
if the council &apos;s after you , then why are you here ?
because i don &apos;t know where to go .
tyler &apos;s dead , and everything &apos;s different now .
and i--
can i help you ?
sorry .
all good here .
what &apos;s going on ?
we just need to ask you a few questions about your son .
you can &apos;t arrest me . i &apos;m the mayor of this town .
not anymore , you &apos;re not .
sorry , liz .
you &apos;re not going to work today .
what are you talking about ?
what &apos;s going on ?
they &apos;re taking your badge .
you &apos;re not fit to protect us anymore .
you have no idea what you &apos;re up against .
on the contrary , liz . i &apos;ve already taken your deputies .
we &apos;ve got the entire town &apos;s supply of vervain ,
including the stash found in the salvatore house .
we &apos;re making our move .
mom ! hey .
caroline , where are you ? and tell me it &apos;s far away .
where am i ? good question .
uh , just a whole lot of boring highways .
why ? is everything ok ?
oh ! caroline , what &apos;s going on ? !
it &apos;s disgusting .
no , it &apos;s , um ...
it &apos;s disgusting .
yeah , i &apos;m going to puke .
i never thought i &apos;d be saying this ,
but i can &apos;t stop thinking about blood .
i should have saved you first .
you shouldn &apos;t be going through this right now .
no , if you had saved me , then matt would be dead .
what do you think i &apos;d be going through then ?
stefan , listen to me .
you did the right thing .
you did what you always do-- you respected my choice .
and what am i supposed to do
if bonnie can &apos;t figure out a way to help you , huh ?
because then you &apos;ll have another choice to make--
either let yourself die , or be a vampire .
well , then we &apos;ll cross that bridge when we come to it .
oh , my god . did--
did i just say ,
&quot; cross that bridge &quot; ?
you &apos;re laughing .
i &apos;m pretty sure you don &apos;t actually think that &apos;s funny .
i ...
i can &apos;t stop , though .
your emotions are a bit heightened today .
a lot heightened .
it &apos;s ok .
it &apos;s ok .
i &apos;m sorry , i ...
listen to me .
no matter what happens ,
i &apos;m here for you .
i can help you .
yeah , i--i--
why don &apos;t you go back upstairs where it &apos;s dark .
i &apos;ll clean up .
i thought you left .
cute pjs .
i &apos;m tired , damon .
i brought you this .
i thought that was gone .
thank you .
i just have to say something .
why do you have to say it with my necklace ?
because what i &apos;m about to say is ...
probably the most selfish thing i &apos;ve ever said in my life .
damon , don &apos;t go there .
no , i just have to say it once .
you just need to hear it .
i love you , elena .
and it &apos;s because i love you that ...
i can &apos;t be selfish with you .
and why you can &apos;t know this .
i don &apos;t deserve you .
but my brother does .
god , i wish you didn &apos;t have to forget this .
but you do .
you should know better than to sneak up on a lady .
good advice . have you seen one ?
tragic about elena .
not to make the gray cloud grayer ,
but does matt even have automobile insurance ?
stefan !
elena , don &apos;t move .
ah , you incessant woman .
hey , mom . what &apos;s up ?
tyler , thank god . are you ok ?
fine . why ? what &apos;s going on ?
pastor young had me arrested this morning .
the council grilled me on your whereabouts .
tyler , don &apos;t tell me where you are .
the less i know , the better .
mom , i &apos;m ok . relax .
you didn &apos;t answer your phone , honey .
i was so scared that you were with caroline .
why ?
what happened to caroline ?
the council took her .
what do you mean , they took her ?
vervain ropes .
looks like alaric outed us all to the council .
the council ...
what exactly do they think they can do to me ?
what the hell happened ? !
tyler ?
i &apos;m harder to kill than you think .
you &apos;re alive ? !
tyler , you &apos;re alive !
no time . come on . we have to go .
wait , what about me ?
keep &apos; em busy , little sister .
that &apos;s impossible !
they &apos;re gone .
whoever nailed rebekah took them , too .
please tell me you have something . anything .
i can &apos;t . the council locked carol and me out of our offices .
files , computers , everything .
so the mayor and the sheriff
never contemplated a back @-@ up plan , liz ?
damon , relax .
when caroline called to say she got away ,
did she know where they were planning to take her ?
no , just that she was in some van
in the middle of nowhere
and she managed to escape .
perfect . we &apos;ve narrowed it down to nowhere .
hey . is elena here ?
in what world are you the one that gets to live ? !
damon , stop ! it wasn &apos;t his fault !
let him go , damon . now .
still want to be a writer ?
i remember how you &apos;d read your short stories
to my daughter when you &apos;d baby @-@ sit .
she still loves writing because of you .
why did you bring me here ?
my deputies can watch out for us here .
no vampires have been invited in .
look , elena ,
i know it sounds crazy ,
but years ago it was your parents who were advocating
having an emergency plan for this .
i never thought we &apos;d actually have to use it .
elena ?
are you ok ?
where &apos;s stefan ?
where he can &apos;t hurt you .
he would never hurt me .
you have no idea what you &apos;re talking about .
well , i know that where you go ,
salvatore vampires seem to follow .
you hungry ?
no .
so we &apos;ll hold stefan
until damon comes searching for you two .
and we &apos;ll use rebekah
to lure her siblings back into town .
you &apos;ll give us the white oak stake ,
and then ...
we will exterminate the entire vampire race for good .
something wrong ?
elena , are you ok ?
yeah .
no , i &apos;ve got to get out of here .
get her !
i never thought i &apos;d see you again !
i don &apos;t get it . how are you alive ?
this is going to sound incredible , but ...
easy , love .
wrong time , wrong place , wrong equipment .
you &apos;re miraculously alive . we &apos;re fugitives on the run .
all signs point to hot hybrid vampire sex .
did you just call me &quot; love &quot; ?
i don &apos;t know , love .
did i ?
what the hell did you do to tyler ?
that &apos;s what i enjoy about you .
so much more than a pretty face .
oh , my god . you &apos;re klaus !
you &apos;re disgusting !
and you &apos;re a glorious kisser .
listen ...
i didn &apos;t have to risk exposure to come save you .
oh , you do one semi @-@ decent thing and now you &apos;re my hero ?
ugh ! i need to go sanitize your mouth .
your mouth was all over me .
i was an innocent victim .
put tyler back .
gladly .
then maybe i &apos;ll take you up on your offer
of hot hybrid sex .
the spirits aren &apos;t listening .
well , is that it ? is that all we can do ?
there &apos;s something else i could try .
what ? do it .
if the witches won &apos;t help me save elena ,
then maybe i could go to
the other side and bring her back myself .
the other side ? the other side &apos;s for dead people .
she &apos;s still in transition .
not fully dead , not fully alive .
what if her spirit still exists on both sides ?
even if it does , how can you get there ? you &apos;re not dead .
no . no , bonnie !
i was able to stop
your heart to stop klaus &apos; .
i &apos;ll do the same thing to myself .
witches have free reign on the other side .
i will find elena and i will bring her back with me .
assuming you wake up !
i &apos;m stronger now . i found a new source of power .
a new source of power ? !
what kind of powers can let you kill yourself
and bring someone back with you from the dead ?
do you want elena back or not ?
with your vervain and alaric &apos;s weapons ,
they could be anywhere .
come on , guys , think .
it takes a lot to hold a vampire .
reinforced steel , iron doors .
the pastor has a cattle ranch .
those pens could easily be modified .
it &apos;s remote , it &apos;s secluded .
well , guess what .
looks like you get a chance to prove how sorry you really are .
let &apos;s go .
i thought i killed you .
where am i ?
they thought you were a vampire
so they stuck you in here with us .
where &apos;s stefan ?
elena , i &apos;m right here . are you ok ?
stefan ...
i need to feed .
i see what &apos;s going on here .
you died with vampire blood in your system
and you didn &apos;t feed
and now you &apos;re locked up in here
without a drop of human blood in sight .
that is a problem .
just ignore her .
has anyone done the math , or shall i ?
i &apos;d say you &apos;ve got less than three hours to feed
before i get to watch you die all over again .
my day just got a whole lot better .
bonnie ...
bonnie , open your eyes .
bonnie , i can &apos;t let you do this .
you &apos;re dying !
what the hell is that ? !
bonnie , no !
hey ! bonnie !
bonnie , wake up !
bonnie , wake up !
elena ...
come back .
come back , elena .
stefan ?
stefan , something &apos;s happening .
you &apos;re going home .
no .
grams ? what are you doing ?
you can &apos;t be in here .
you stay away from this sort of darkness .
elena needs me .
she is not your problem to solve .
now go . before they try to keep you here .
grams ? please !
this magic is dark , bonnie .
it is not nature &apos;s plan . touch it again ,
and the spirits will unleash their anger
in ways that will make you suffer .
stay away .
go !
bonnie , wake up !
wake up ! come on .
bonnie , open your eyes .
ha ! you &apos;re awake !
you &apos;re alive .
i couldn &apos;t do it .
it didn &apos;t work .
stefan ?
what happened ?
i &apos;m out of time .
i need blood .
i &apos;m dying .
anyone ! hey !
will you shut up ?
you think we &apos;re afraid of you ?
you want more vervain ?
keep it down .
listen to me .
elena &apos;s going to die if you don &apos;t let her out of here .
sorry . not my problem .
she &apos;s innocent . let her out .
let her out !
stop !
i said , let her out !
she said she &apos;s not strong enough .
you were strong enough to put me in here .
surely you &apos;re strong enough to get me out .
i upset the spirits trying to save elena .
i can &apos;t use that kind of magic again . it &apos;s too dangerous .
bonnie , do the bloody spell !
she said she can &apos;t , ok ?
we &apos;ll just wait a few days
until you &apos;re strong enough to do it
with traditional magic . right , bonnie ?
what are you doing ?
ripping tyler &apos;s heart out . i &apos;ll jump into someone else .
maybe you .
oh , my god .
oh , my god , stop , stop !
he &apos;s bluffing . he needs a witch to do that .
what makes you think i don &apos;t have one ?
or ten ? pick , bonnie !
you or tyler !
stop ! please ! you &apos;re killing him !
fine , i &apos;ll do it ! just stop .
good .
let &apos;s begin .
elena .
are you still with me ?
yeah .
yeah , i &apos;m here .
i &apos;m ok .
no , you &apos;re not .
i can hear your breathing .
damon was right .
you should have fed this morning .
i &apos;m so sorry .
don &apos;t be .
you had hope .
that &apos;s all i ever wanted you to have .
and you had it .
i love you so much .
do you know why i was even on that bridge ?
i was coming back for you , stefan .
i had to choose , and ...
i picked you .
because i love you .
no matter what happens ...
it &apos;s the best choice i ever made .
god ... it sucks i can &apos;t see you right now .
i &apos;m smiling .
me , too .
so , what , we just storm the place
with zero weapons ?
no , we don &apos;t need weapons .
just bait .
anybody home ?
there &apos;s a big , bad vampire out here .
let him go , the boy &apos;s innocent .
well , that &apos;s the point .
give me stefan and elena , he &apos;s all yours .
come on , pastor . you know i &apos;ll kill him .
i want to kill him .
go away .
you are not invited in ! and i &apos;m not coming out .
this is black magic . she shouldn &apos;t be doing this .
tyler ...
caroline .
tyler !
bonnie , what are you doing ?
i warned you , child .
i warned you to stay away .
bonnie , it works . stop .
what &apos;s happening ? let me go !
i can &apos;t .
let me go !
bonnie , what &apos;s happening ?
i can &apos;t let her go !
bonnie , stop the spell !
you made your choice .
now they &apos;re taking it out on me .
i &apos;m sorry , grams !
they can &apos;t do this to you !
please ! don &apos;t do this to her !
bonnie , stop !
no ! no ! no !
oh , my god !
what have i done ? ! what do i do ? !
you &apos;re ok , you &apos;re ok .
what did i do ? !
i got this .
bring the other one in .
excuse me !
hello , sir ?
i thought i told you to shut up .
here &apos;s the thing-- my family , we-- we have money .
castles , apartments , jewelry .
just name your price and let me out .
i &apos;d much rather watch you die .
elena . elena !
go ahead and kill me .
you can &apos;t possibly hate me more than i hate myself .
oh , yes , i can .
it should have been you .
leave him alone !
just stop ! stop saving me .
what the hell is your problem ?
what do you want me to say , thank you ?
because honestly , i wish you &apos;d just let me drown .
what , you think you were my first choice ?
elena &apos;s a vampire because of me .
i have to live with that every day for the rest of my life .
no , no , you don &apos;t have to live with that ,
you get to live with that .
because elena put your life before her own .
so every morning when you get out of bed ,
you sure as hell better earn it .
you were going to kill him .
yep . the guy just won &apos;t die .
it was my choice to save him .
why aren &apos;t you seeing that ?
it &apos;s a little hard to keep track of all your choices lately , elena .
i remember everything .
one of the highlights of my transition ...
remembering everything
that you compelled me to forget .
like how you and i met first .
we were strangers .
and you told me you wanted me to get everything i wanted from life .
damon , why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
would it have made a difference ?
i didn &apos;t think so .
you asked me to make a choice , damon .
so i did .
if you &apos;re going to be mad ,
then take it out on me , not on stefan
or matt or anyone else . me .
are we done here ?
if it had been you at the bridge last night
and not stefan ,
and i begged you to save matt--
i would have saved you . in a heartbeat , no question .
that &apos;s what i thought .
then matt would be dead
because you couldn &apos;t let go .
matt would be dead !
but you wouldn &apos;t be .
and you would have gotten to grow up .
and had the life that you wanted ; the life that you deserve .
and i know that i didn &apos;t used to get that , but i do now .
and i wanted that for you , elena .
and i would have gladly have given it to you
and let matt die because i am that selfish .
but you knew that already .
the first night we met &apos;s not all you remember .
how dare you save caroline over me !
&quot; hello , brother , i thought you were dead .
so pleased you &apos;re not . &quot;
you left me .
i only had time to save one of you
and you can &apos;t be killed .
rest assured , i had a worse day than you .
i think it &apos;s time for us to move on , find some more werewolves .
so you can create your hybrid family ?
you don &apos;t know anything about family !
well , i know how easily they can be silenced with a dagger .
no !
drop them .
i mourned you !
my heart broke thinking i &apos;d never see you again !
put the blood down , rebekah , there &apos;s a good girl .
it &apos;s always been me ! not finn .
not elijah , not kol , me .
i loved you through everything and you don &apos;t even care .
drop it !
you want your family ?
here &apos;s your family .
you know something , rebekah , you were right .
i don &apos;t care .
from this moment on , you &apos;re not my family ,
you &apos;re not my sister .
you are nothing .
the whole council knows who we are now .
everything &apos;s about to change .
yeah , i &apos;m sure damon has a revenge plan cooked up .
we &apos;ll figure out a way to deal with it .
stefan , you don &apos;t have to convince me
that everything &apos;s going to be ok .
i know .
wish i could , though .
wish i could just tell you that you &apos;ll never feel pain .
that you &apos;ll never crave blood .
but you will .
it will be the worst thing that you &apos;ve ever lived through .
but i &apos;ll get to live .
i &apos;ll be a sister and a friend , and ...
i &apos;ll be with you .
forever .
if i want .
i &apos;m going to get through this .
just like we get through everything ,
one day at a time .
we should get inside before sunrise .
bonnie made this for you yesterday .
just in case .
daylight ring ?
one day at a time , right ?
folks , by now you know that the vampires have escaped .
and it won &apos;t be long before they retaliate against us .
but fear not .
for i have been chosen to lead us in a movement .
what are you talking about ?
hear me , loved ones .
soon we &apos;ll be free to pass through the gates ...
and we &apos;ll all reunite in eternity .
seriously , pastor , what &apos;s going on here ?
friends ...
