i start chemo tonight . it &apos;s lymphoma .
how &apos;s your daughter taking it ?
you haven &apos;t told her .
i &apos;ve never met anyone like you .
i &apos;m leaving .
where are you going ?
los angeles .
have you talked to emily ?
she loves you .
i told her i wouldn &apos;t wait .
the only thing stopping you from choosing jack is you .
i don &apos;t deserve him !
but you deserve me ?
ben , i &apos;m sorry .
jack &apos;s flight leaves in 20 minutes .
what are you doing here , mason ? we had a deal .
yes , we did .
everything changed .
everything but you .
i can &apos;t get ahold of victoria , and i &apos;m worried about her .
something is not right with her .
mrs. grayson , what do you plan to do ?
something amanda clarke
never had the courage to do herself ...
end this .
this area is off limits , ma &apos;am .
amanda !
amanda , oh . thank god you &apos;re okay .
i just got home . i saw the flames .
i was so worried about you .
i &apos;m fine .
i &apos;m fine .
i just can &apos;t believe this .
what the hell happened ? !
well , too soon to tell , ms. clarke .
think it was arson ?
anything &apos;s possible .
investigators will be on site within the hour .
anyone else home at the time ? a housekeeper , a friend ?
no , thank god . the house is empty .
i &apos;m very sorry for the loss , ma &apos;am . pardon me .
all these years , i thought about watching it burn .
i never imagined it would be mine when it did .
there &apos;s nothing else you can do here tonight .
let &apos;s just hope that it was an accident .
you stay with me now . come on , amanda .
let &apos;s go home .
yeah .
morning , sleepyhead .
morning .
what &apos;s all this ?
well , i was up early .
figured i &apos;d scramble you a few eggs .
no big deal .
well , you should be careful .
a guy could get used to this ,
and a guy could really get used to last night .
is that so ?
you know ... healthy breakfast ,
it &apos;s , uh ... it &apos;s just one way to start the day .
i , um ...
i can think of a few others .
i love that idea , but this will have to suffice .
some of us have to get ready for work .
buzzkill .
well , can &apos;t blame a guy for trying .
bon appetit .
geez , ems , what &apos;s with all the ...
louise ?
did you hear about the fire at grayson manor ?
of course .
well , tell me i shouldn &apos;t be worried .
about what ?
i tried calling
victoria several times , but she hasn &apos;t answered .
how odd . she promised she would call me today .
but i still haven &apos;t heard from her , either .
well , we both know she hasn &apos;t been herself lately .
and with everything that emily &apos;s done to her ...
you don &apos;t think she had anything to do with that fire , do you ?
no . don &apos;t be ridiculous .
that was nothing more than karma catching up with emily .
it &apos;s about time .
as for victoria , if i haven &apos;t heard from her by lunch ,
i &apos;ll go to the penthouse and make sure she &apos;s okay .
what is that ?
i don &apos;t know , but it &apos;s victoria &apos;s handwriting .
and the landscape of the hamptons will never be the same .
that was always our goal .
how can you not be a little upset by this ?
this is your home .
this house belonged to emily thorne ,
not amanda clarke .
and it was never a home . it was part of a plan .
yeah , a plan that almost blew up in your face , literally .
thank god that you went to go stop jack ,
and i &apos;m guessing from his absence
that one of two things happened .
i was too late .
i &apos;m so glad it was door number one .
that ... t @-@ that means that you can talk to him
and tell him how you really feel ,
and if ever there was a sign from god
to be free and move on ...
i can &apos;t . not yet .
i may have missed jack , but ... i ran into an old friend .
rather he ran into me .
mason treadwell .
what ?
crazy capote is back .
i thought you had exiled him to the maldives .
can &apos;t anybody follow a simple revenge plan ?
oh , right .
you didn &apos;t when you revealed yourself as amanda .
he was furious that i backed out of our deal
for him to write my story .
well , what does he want now ?
for you to give him the old david clarke ?
clear his name so he can resurrect himself ?
i was called about the fire
before i could explain to him that that can &apos;t happen .
but i &apos;m meeting with him today to shut him down .
we &apos;ve got a body over here !
what ?
&quot; my dearest margaux ,
i write to you today filled with sadness .
and i &apos;m afraid i will be passing that sorrow onto you .
for that , i am sorry .
but as i now find my name synonymous with hatred ,
it &apos;s an identity i can no longer bear .
i &apos;ve lost the will to fight , as the pain runs too deep .
i &apos;m afraid that leaves only one option
that may seem drastic to you .
body &apos;s too badly burned to identify .
but we found this near the deceased .
any idea who it belongs to ?
i &apos;ve decided to end my life .
know that my heart is full of love for you now and forever .
eternally yours ...
victoria grayson .
第四季第二十一集
so , what caused the fire ?
i don &apos;t know yet , but ...
what ?
they found a body in the debris .
i can &apos;t believe i &apos;m about to say this , but ...
they think it might have been victoria .
the coroner &apos;s trying to confirm right now .
that can &apos;t be .
i know .
they found the engagement ring pascal gave her ,
but ... what if she planted it there
to make it look like someone killed her ?
that &apos;s certainly in line with something victoria would do .
i mean , this whole thing could be a hoax .
but it &apos;s not .
the remains were too burnt for dna ,
so all we had to go on were the teeth we recovered .
but the coroner checked her dental records .
it &apos;s definitely victoria grayson .
after ... all the years of pain that she &apos;s caused our family .
and she tried to cause more by killing me .
and failed .
actually , you &apos;re wrong .
we got a call from margaux lemarchal .
victoria left a suicide note .
she wanted to die in grayson manor .
yeah , that house was a symbol
of everything the grayson name stood for ...
wealth , power , status .
she simply wanted to die in the place she cherished most .
and to take back what i had taken from her .
i &apos;m here because i have one question .
how did she bypass your security ?
i &apos;ve seen behind the curtain , remember ?
so has she .
she managed to steal some information from us .
nolan &apos;s specs on my alarm
must have been among the things she got .
well , at least this war &apos;s over between you two .
i &apos;ll be in touch if we have any follow @-@ up .
uh , thanks for letting us know .
i really appreciate ...
i was just doing my job .
i was dispatched to the scene . that &apos;s all .
ben , it doesn &apos;t need to be like this .
doesn &apos;t it ? you made your choice .
oh , i like that .
you have to build that one taller . good job .
you know , i was just thinking about how great it &apos;ll be
to do this in the middle of winter .
not that i won &apos;t have my own less impressive place by then .
you know you can stay as long as you want .
careful what you offer . i just might take you up on it .
oh , i &apos;m counting on it .
i still can &apos;t believe i have you both out here .
after i tried to convince you last year ,
i had to reconcile myself
to the fact that it would never happen .
jack , i &apos;m so proud of you .
i &apos;m glad you decided to put the past behind you .
yeah , it just feels right , you know ?
fresh start &apos;s exactly what we needed .
now i &apos;m just gonna have to compete with actors
for bartending jobs .
at least until i get on my own feet again , you know ?
hey , buddy .
jack , you &apos;re gonna want to see this .
here amid the rubble from last night &apos;s blaze
at what was known as grayson manor .
east coast society circles are abuzz this morning
with news that hampton socialite victoria grayson
was a casualty in the deadly explosion .
oh , my god .
the house belonged to the grayson family
for more than two decades
before being purchased by emily thorne ,
who just last week revealed herself to be amanda clarke .
there was a long history of tragedy , heartache , and scandal
among these ruins .
just six weeks ago , daniel grayson ...
i thought you &apos;d want to know right away .
ding dong , the bitch is dead .
victoria grayson has actually taken her last breath .
it &apos;s hard to believe , but ...
coroner confirmed it .
and she lit the match herself ?
i got to say i did not see that coming .
a guilty conscience can be a powerful thing .
so ...
what does the world sans victoria grayson even look like ?
revenge @-@ free .
and i didn &apos;t even have to snap her neck .
i still can &apos;t believe you didn &apos;t hear the explosion .
well , i was entertaining ... a guest .
we were making our own noise .
tony ?
emily , i think ...
i think i &apos;m falling for him .
i know . i know .
what would you say if i asked him on a little vacay ?
somewhere far from the hamptons .
too soon ?
no , i &apos;d say go for it .
don &apos;t hold back , nolan .
that &apos;s what i did with jack , and look where it got me .
and i have a private jet at your beck and call ...
if you want to fix that .
and i will .
but first i have to deal with mason ,
and knowing him , i &apos;m probably gonna need your help ...
so don &apos;t pack your bags just yet .
i had to fly in disguise and in economy to get here .
sit with the common man , catch the common cold .
i &apos;m not happy about it ,
nor am i happy about your being late , ms. clarke .
well , i had a few problems to deal with .
ah , yes .
yes , i heard your house went up in flames .
tragic . gee , i wonder how that feels .
look , mason ... - the good news is that your biggest problem
died in that fire ,
though i always thought victoria would first burn in hell ,
not in the hamptons .
but now it &apos;s time to focus on me
and clearing me of killing gordon murphy
before i , too , become a white @-@ haired man .
things have changed .
when i made that promise ,
i was planning on taking the blame for you
and running away from here forever .
still a great plan .
don &apos;t give up on yourself .
look , i &apos;m not gonna put myself at risk .
my father is alive now .
i finally have the chance to be happy , to ...
try to have the life i always wanted .
well , who knew that a side effect of happiness is naivety ?
i want the life i deserve .
then name the place , and i &apos;ll set it up .
i &apos;ll get you a new identity , everything that you want .
has amanda clarke forgotten
emily thorne already dangled that rancid carrot ?
you think i was happy in the maldives ?
it &apos;s sinking into the ocean , for god &apos;s sake .
oh , and have i mentioned
that while water rose above my ankles ,
i started writing another tome ?
i &apos;m calling it &quot; one big lie : the amanda clarke story . &quot;
it &apos;ll be your word against mine .
think about it .
a book written by a dead man .
people will eat that up .
it &apos;s sure to blow the lid off this good @-@ girl image
you tricked people into believing .
at the very least , it &apos;ll open up a police inquiry .
it &apos;ll haunt you the rest of your days
and destroy whatever norman rockwell life
you think you &apos;re going to have with your father .
you have two days to clear my name ,
or i send the first 50 pages to publishers ,
newspapers , and homeland security .
your move , amanda .
jackie boy .
hey , thought i &apos;d give you at least 24 hours
without any hamptons drama .
it &apos;s kind of hard to avoid when it &apos;s all over the news .
don &apos;t worry .
all things considered , ems is doing okay .
i &apos;m not calling about how she &apos;s doing .
i &apos;m calling about what she did .
they &apos;re saying that victoria committed suicide .
but please tell me that this isn &apos;t just
some sort of poetic end to emily &apos;s revenge plan ,
that she &apos;s not that far gone .
no , of course not . no , vickie did herself in .
and she left a note and her chompers behind as evidence .
besides , you know ems would never go death squad on anyone .
i &apos;m not sure what i know anymore .
well , our favorite ex @-@ revenger
just walked through the door .
want me to give her your regards ?
i have to go . i &apos;ll be in touch .
was that jack ?
yeah . well ... he had to run .
you know , carl was crying .
you don &apos;t have to lie , nolan .
i know why he &apos;s angry with me , and ... i &apos;m gonna fix it .
but first , i need your help .
is there any way to create some kind of pre @-@ dated paper trail
from conrad grayson to his lawyer ?
something that proves that conrad killed gordon murphy
and framed mason for it ?
so , our pal wouldn &apos;t take no for an answer ?
well , yeah , i mean ,
i could create a mountain of phony documents ,
but what makes you think the u.s. attorney &apos;s office
wouldn &apos;t be slightly suspicious about where they came from ?
leave that to me .
carl &apos;s down for his nap .
thanks .
i still can &apos;t fathom the idea that victoria &apos;s gone .
that woman changed the course of my life .
she stole my husband . she ... drove me to drink .
she ran me out of town .
you &apos;re not the only person whose life she destroyed .
how is emily , anyway ?
is she responsible for this ?
carl &apos;s bedroom is right upstairs .
i couldn &apos;t help but overhear your conversation with nolan .
he said that her hands are clean .
why do you have to know ?
i worry that emily still has a hold on you .
you don &apos;t have to .
i &apos;m not going back to the hamptons .
there &apos;s nothing for me there .
not anymore .
mrs. grayson must have been
in a lot of pain to do such a thing .
terrible tragedy .
my condolences on the loss of your home .
well , strangely , that &apos;s what brings me here today .
i was salvaging some of my belongings from the wreckage ,
and i stumbled upon ...
a hidden compartment in the floor of my den .
i would never have seen it had it not been for the fire .
and inside of it ...
was this fireproof box ...
filled with documents belonging to conrad grayson .
there &apos;s no end to that guy &apos;s secrets .
well , i &apos;m no lawyer , but it seems that conrad was up to
way more than this office was even aware of .
i figured you &apos;d want to see these .
thank you , ms. clarke . we &apos;ll investigate further .
the d.o.j. takes anything regarding mr. grayson
very seriously .
just trying to do my part .
it &apos;s done .
i &apos;m pleased to hear that .
you won &apos;t be in hiding much longer .
the u.s. attorney is holding proof
that conrad killed gordon murphy and framed you for it .
i smell a posthumous pardon , don &apos;t you ?
in the meantime , stay out of sight .
oh , not to worry . i &apos;ve become a master at playing dead .
i &apos;ll contact you when it &apos;s time
for your official resurrection .
oh , i anxiously await your call .
you were right .
being here in victoria &apos;s home around her belongings ,
it does help a little .
how did i miss this ?
i knew she was in a dark place , but ...
the pain she must have been in
to do something like that to herself .
it &apos;s not your fault .
besides , i &apos;m still not entirely convinced .
i &apos;ve been in and out of mental institutions for most of my life ,
and i know suicidal tendencies when i see them .
she didn &apos;t show any of the usual signs .
oh , louise .
it &apos;s normal to look for answers at a time like this .
but we read her note .
she was resolute in her decision .
was she , though ?
i mean , i saw the date book on her desk ,
and she scheduled a mani / pedi for next week .
now , why would someone with a death wish
worry about their cuticles ?
just doesn &apos;t make any sense .
death rarely does .
i &apos;ll get us a refill .
margaux ! come quick !
someone forced this door open .
oh , my god , there is blood .
i think someone broke in here and attacked victoria .
we need to call the police .
i knew it .
this wasn &apos;t a suicide at all .
this was murder .
hey , is nolan here ?
should have been here an hour ago .
you monster !
you killed victoria on the same spot her son died .
how could you ?
louise , i know you &apos;re broken up
and you &apos;re trying to pass the blame ,
but i had nothing to do with this .
victoria &apos;s death was ruled a suicide by the police . it &apos;s over .
oh , that &apos;s yesterday &apos;s news .
now they &apos;re calling it murder .
and with my help , it &apos;s only a matter of time
until they prove you &apos;re the one that attacked her in that garage .
this again ? let it go , louise . it wasn &apos;t me .
but that wasn &apos;t enough for you , was it ?
you had to go and kill her !
you are crazy .
this is nothing but fabrications and lies . i &apos;m leaving .
huh , i wonder who that could be .
hamptons &apos; finest , perhaps .
not as crazy as you thought i was .
you will pay dearly for what you &apos;ve done ,
and i will be the first on the stand to testify to it .
hi .
i just , uh , got called into the police station .
apparently , victoria &apos;s death is now considered a homicide .
yeah , they called me in , too .
i think they &apos;re just covering their bases .
dad , is there something you &apos;re not telling me ?
what do you mean ?
if there is a reason for an investigation ,
we are the prime suspects .
and i can &apos;t have anything bad happen to you right now .
nothing bad is gonna happen .
i promise .
where were you last night ?
i was working on my boat .
by myself .
please tell me someone saw you .
a passerby on the pier , anyone ?
i believe you , but the police might not .
i was , uh , below deck fixing the alternator the whole time .
come on .
let &apos;s get going .
seeing you like that ,
definitely thinking somewhere tropical .
what do you mean ?
i &apos;m considering taking a much @-@ needed vacation ,
and ... pina coladas for two
sound a lot more exciting than pina coladas for one .
really ?
i know it &apos;s crazy @-@ fast for us to be travel mates .
it &apos;s almost like i &apos;m asking you to shack up or something ,
which i &apos;m not ... i mean , at least not yet .
i don &apos;t know . maybe someday ...
okay .
and i &apos;m gonna shut up now .
you &apos;re cute when you &apos;re nervous .
then i must be the cutest guy you &apos;ve ever seen .
well , as it happens , i also like you ...
a lot .
and i can &apos;t think of a better way to spend my vacation days
than relaxing on a beach with you .
aw . work . i got to go .
there is one caveat , though .
i &apos;m more of a tequila guy .
but i &apos;m confident we can work past our differences .
you worried about your dad ?
of course i &apos;m not .
good .
because we need to focus on you for the moment .
do you really think i blew up my house to kill victoria ?
well , there was certainly no love lost
between the two of you , and it &apos;s pretty clear
that someone overpowered her in her penthouse .
and when would i have done that ?
the last person to see her was ms. lemarchal
early in the evening , which gives you time .
and if not you , i &apos;m sure one of your band of merry men
could have taken care of it ,
much like you all covered up daniel &apos;s death .
so , where were you around 8 : 00 the night of the explosion ?
i was with you at my house .
and after that ?
you know where i was .
are you really gonna make this personal ?
the sooner you answer the question ,
the sooner we can move on .
i went to the airport .
and did you catch jack ?
is that relevant ?
it is if he &apos;s your alibi .
i missed him . - his plane had already taken off .
so , no one can actually corroborate
that you went to the airport .
this is gonna be hard to believe .
mason treadwell can .
the mason treadwell who died in prison last year ?
so , a corpse is your alibi in the murder of your sworn enemy ?
no , look , he showed up at the airport .
believe me , i was just as stunned as you are .
i &apos;ll call him right now .
please , knock yourself out .
the number you have reached has been disconnected .
please check the number and dial again .
dead man didn &apos;t pay his phone bill ?
i &apos;ll find him .
i hope you do .
but in the meantime , did anyone else see you with mason ?
jimmy hoffa ? amelia earhart ?
come on , ben . no .
look , i saw him again yesterday . he &apos;s keeping a low profile .
we ... we talked in my car .
great . give me your keys .
if what you &apos;re saying is true , then you should have no problem
with me checking your car for mason &apos;s fingerprints .
fine .
can i go now ?
you can leave the room .
just don &apos;t leave town .
what are you doing here ?
i was called back for questioning .
parently when you leave town
the night someone you openly hate is killed ,
it looks a little suspicious .
they already talk to you ?
well , when someone you openly hate dies in your house ,
also a little suspicious .
jack , i had nothing to do with it .
i wasn &apos;t gonna ...
no , you were .
i don &apos;t blame you .
it &apos;s just this whole thing , it &apos;s ...
it &apos;s hard to imagine .
you know , when i heard about the fire ...
i &apos;m just ... glad you weren &apos;t home .
why didn &apos;t you say goodbye ?
mr. porter . they &apos;re ready for you .
i should ...
jack .
come by the beach house later .
please . i need to talk to you .
as soon as i &apos;m done here ,
i &apos;m on the next flight back to l.a.
goodbye , amanda .
did you follow up on david clarke &apos;s alibi ?
yeah , it checks out .
spoke to a doctor who confirmed he was at suffolk memorial .
and there he is .
margarita for you , sir .
pina coladas for me .
to our differences .
too much salt . i should have asked .
it &apos;s not that . it &apos;s just ...
i can &apos;t go on a trip with you .
because the drinks are so good here ,
why leave the beach club ?
a few months ago ,
i started adoption proceedings
through the foster @-@ care system .
i was told it could take months , maybe even years ,
which is why i hadn &apos;t told you yet
and why i thought i could go on vacation .
but ...
i found out today i &apos;m getting a baby .
that &apos;s exciting . i @-@ i mean , congratulations .
thank you .
soon ?
yeah . like ... in two days .
i have so much to do , i don &apos;t even know where to start .
okay , we &apos;re not leaving town .
we &apos;ll drive into the city ,
and we will stock up on all the swag a single dad needs .
that &apos;s what i need to talk to you about , nolan .
the thing this single dad needs is to be single .
i would love for us to work , but becoming a dad ...
i &apos;ve wanted this for a long time .
and while it both excites me and terrifies me ,
it &apos;s something i know i need to give 100 % to ,
and , in doing so ,
our relationship would get short @-@ changed ,
you will be short @-@ changed .
no , no , no , no , no .
okay ..
tony ...
despite appearances ...
i can be pretty low @-@ maintenance .
i promise .
i &apos;m sorry , nolan .
it wouldn &apos;t be fair to you or to me or to my little boy .
well , i wish i &apos;d met you a year ago .
me too .
goodbye , nolan .
bye .
the car picked us up around 7 : 00 .
okay , i &apos;m gonna need - the name of the car service
and that plane &apos;s tail number .
i get that the timing of my departure seems curious .
a guy lives here his whole life .
spur of the moment , moves to california
minutes before grayson manor goes up in flames .
yeah .
i could have answered these questions over the phone .
but we both know those calls are recorded .
so , what did you really want to ask me ?
did you help her ?
of course not .
look , i &apos;m doing you a favor by keeping this off the record
because you and i both know
that you have helped emily cover up things in the past .
i need you to be honest with me here .
well , then let me be clear .
i had absolutely nothing to do with victoria grayson &apos;s death .
i was with my family the entire night .
and has emily said anything to you about what happened ?
look , the only time i &apos;ve spoken with emily recently
was a few minutes ago when she assured me
she had nothing to do with this .
now , let me ask you a question off the record .
isn &apos;t this a conflict of interest ?
you working on a case that involves your girlfriend ?
you don &apos;t know ?
know what ?
we broke up the night you left .
she ran to the airport to stop you .
you won , porter .
she chose you .
amanda .
what are you doing here ?
dr. fogel , chief of oncology .
that &apos;s who corroborated your story the other night .
why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
the other day when you came by my house
and told me that everything was over
and that there were no more battles to be fought ,
i saw a look in your eye
that i haven &apos;t seen since i &apos;ve been back ,
since ... since you were a girl .
and i wasn &apos;t able to destroy that .
you don &apos;t have to protect me .
i know i don &apos;t have to . but i want to .
look , it &apos;s a form of lymphoma .
the good news is they got it early ,
and i &apos;m getting cutting @-@ edge treatment .
everything &apos;s gonna be fine .
how are you feeling ?
oh , you know , i &apos;m okay .
tired , but i &apos;m okay .
well , better now that you know .
sorry i kept it from you .
we &apos;re in this together now . that &apos;s all that matters .
all right .
what do you say we have a movie night ?
i &apos;ll go get some popcorn , and , uh , we &apos;ll meet at the house .
sounds perfect .
how &apos;s it coming ?
we are just about done , detective .
you find any clean prints ?
a bunch .
we &apos;ll run them through afisí , see if we get a hit .
also , found a few strands of hair with follicular tags .
great . check everything .
what &apos;s that stage of grief
where you want to throttle someone ?
i can &apos;t be sure .
i &apos;m starting to feel as if that &apos;s my baseline .
i feel so helpless .
we &apos;re just sitting here like lame ducks
wallowing in our grief while she goes on with her life .
did you give your statement to the police ?
yes .
i told them victoria feared for her safety .
but amanda , she &apos;s ... slippery .
she didn &apos;t even bat an eye when i accused her
of killing victoria , and i know she did it .
i have to do something .
oh , i &apos;m one step ahead of you .
what is all this ?
something i should have done weeks ago .
victoria came to me asking to use my media outlets
in her case against amanda , but i refused .
something i will always regret .
margaux .
now , this won &apos;t bring victoria back .
but i &apos;ll be damned - if i don &apos;t use every resource
at my disposal to make this right .
hello ?
the wheels of justice move swiftly .
i just received a news alert that my name has been cleared .
well done , amanda .
i have been calling and calling . where the hell are you ?
oh , just following orders . staying out of sight .
remember , innocence aside ,
in the eyes of the world , i &apos;m still six feet under .
well , i &apos;m gonna need to resurrect you as soon as possible .
you &apos;re my alibi the night victoria died .
ooh . tough break .
&apos;cause i have no intention of seeing you again .
ever .
consider it payback for all the hell you put me through .
how does it feel to have the louboutin on the other foot ?
i know you , mason .
sooner or later , you will get tired
of whatever rock you &apos;re living under
and your ego won &apos;t be able to resist the urge
to announce your glorious return to the living .
don &apos;t hold your breath , unless you have
a victoria grayson @-@ level death wish , that is .
and speaking of our dearly departed ,
victoria had one final request before killing herself .
she asked me to pass along a message to you .
that &apos;s right .
after your scintillating tv tell @-@ all ,
i reached out to the one person
who &apos;d been screwed harder than me .
see you never , amanda .
hello , amanda .
i &apos;m sending you this message
to tell you that i &apos;m ending your game of revenge .
by the time you receive this ,
i &apos;ll no longer be among the living .
but i would be remiss if i didn &apos;t thank you
for that brilliant idea i found on that flash drive of yours .
just as you were planning on making it appear
as if i had murdered you on your farcical wedding night ,
i &apos;m going to make it appear
as if you murdered me in your own home .
the only difference ...
you never actually had the guts to kill yourself .
but i do .
so i suppose that makes me the victor in our little game ,
but then who &apos;s keeping score ?
enjoy your life in prison , my dear .
may you suffer greatly .
hold it right there .
ben , listen to me .
amanda clarke , you &apos;re under arrest
for the murder of victoria grayson .
victoria set me up . we just have to find mason treadwell .
the mason treadwell you claim was in your car ?
his fingerprints were nowhere to be found .
that &apos;s impossible .
but we did find hair follicles and traces of blood
belonging to victoria grayson .
what ?
cuff her .
you have the right to remain silent .
anything you say can and will
be used against you in a court of law .
mason put that stuff in there . he was working with victoria !
let me reiterate you have the right to remain silent .
i recommend you do so .
she planned this , ben . i didn &apos;t do it !
can &apos;t you see ? ! i didn &apos;t do this !
please find mason !
emily . what &apos;s happened ?
jack .
i didn &apos;t do it .
she planned this .
that bitch set me up !
i &apos;m innocent .
