look , i am the one who is suffering here .
oh , yes , tell us your troubles .
i am handling all of will &apos;s cases ,
and now we &apos;ve lost caitlin , too .
look , we put someone else into will &apos;s seat , that &apos;s what we do .
excuse me . i &apos;m sitting right here .
there is no &quot; will &apos;s seat &quot; &quot;
you &apos;re not here as a lawyer .
you might as well not be here at all .
that is not the subject of this discussion .
someone spoke to the bar disciplinary board .
someone said will was here working on cases .
now , i &apos;m not going to do anything so dramatic
as to ask , &quot; who was it ? &quot;
but i will say this . if you have an issue
with the way we &apos;re running this firm , you come to me .
you do not stab will in the back .
you don &apos;t lie to the disciplinary board ...
wait a minute . wait a minute .
look , i know nobody wants to respond
because we don &apos;t want to look like judases ,
but will is working on cases .
no , i &apos;m updating associates on the background of my cases .
what ? !
oh , come on .
you call me an ethical midget ?
just a minute ! wait a minute !
we disagree with each other , we keep it in @-@ house !
you want to backstab someone , do it right here .
okay , i disagree . there .
and i urge the equity partners to replace will until such time ...
then marshal the equity partner votes , and call a meeting .
are we done here ?
no .
alicia &apos;s asked for a raise .
i am advocating a ten percent bump .
no , you have a dozen third @-@ year associates
who will be asking for the same exact thing .
then we lose her .
and how do you know that ?
because he &apos;s got a dog in the fight .
we only want alicia because of her ties to her husband .
no , we want her because she &apos;s good .
we &apos;re gonna take your word for it ?
look , look , we all know we &apos;re gonna compromise .
can we just compromise ?
who do you think leaked it ?
could be any one of them .
good thing they don &apos;t like each other , or i &apos;d be dead .
where you headed ?
court .
why ? you don &apos;t have a case today .
diane lockhart .
l @-@ o @-@ c @-@ k @-@ h @-@ a @-@ r @-@ t .
and can you describe what happened , ms. lockhart ?
yes . i was walking from my car
when i saw you in the lobby ,
serving a subpoena to that man .
and did you hear me announce myself ?
ah , yes . i heard you say ,
&quot; mr. dobbs , you have been served . &quot;
then what happened ?
in your own words , ms. lockhart .
uh , well , uh , that man tried to punch you ,
and then you threw him against the wall .
in a manly fashion ?
yes , i would say so .
he says i threw the first punch . that &apos;s why he &apos;s suing me .
uh , that is not what i observed .
you two know each other . that &apos;s why she &apos;s saying that .
do you and i know each other , ms. lockhart ?
uh , well , you served me with a subpoena ,
so i guess to that extent , we know each other .
thank you , ms. lockhart .
your presence here in small @-@ claims court is a breath of fresh air .
objection .
overruled .
and i will ask you to proceed , mrs. florrick .
so the video was taken from the back of the snowmobile ?
uh , yes , my @-@ my wife was taking it .
that &apos;s just her cell phone camera .
and that &apos;s you driving ?
yes . up at the rollins savanna forest preserve .
then what happened ?
the snowmobile-- it just started changing directions .
okay , grant , slow down .
were you steering it toward the trees ?
no .
what are you doing ? !
the steering column locked , and i ...
it &apos;s not funny . stop .
i couldn &apos;t budge it .
please slow down !
grant , slow down ! please !
and what happened to your wife ?
she was in a coma for a week ,
and then she ...
she ... she didn &apos;t make it .
and that &apos;s why you &apos;re suing snow plain ,
the makers of your snowmobile ?
yes . uh , i &apos;ve never sued anyone in my life .
never had much use for the courts .
my @-@ my parents told me ,
&quot; if you have a problem with someone , then , you say it to his face , &quot;
but my wife ...
she was the best thing in my life .
okay , let me interrupt right there .
mrs. florrick , mr. hines ,
why don &apos;t you come up here , and we &apos;ll talk ?
here &apos;s the deal .
first of all , good morning to you all .
good morning .
we &apos;re going into chambers
for a bench @-@ supervised negotiation .
your honor , that &apos;s not necessary .
counselor hines , it is .
your case here is obviously to delay until mr. duverney gives up .
that &apos;s not true !
and i &apos;m not gonna be a party to that .
there are no real legal issues to dispute ,
so here is my order .
marshal your settlement arguments and meet me
in chambers in one hour . understood ?
yes , your honor .
i think i might try my hand at this lawyering .
very impressive .
so i have to thank you .
there &apos;s an art show , or something other , near here .
you &apos;re not really into art ?
no , but i don &apos;t actively dislike it .
i &apos;m sorry , but i have to head back to work .
but you do have to have lunch .
actually , i think someone &apos;s waiting for you ?
okay , then , tonight .
i &apos;ll call you .
you thinking of buying ?
i don &apos;t know what i &apos;m thinking .
everything &apos;s so expensive these days .
well , you know one thing i learned is , life is short .
you get a chance to bring yourself some pleasure ,
you should do it .
even if i had the money , i ... i don &apos;t know .
it &apos;s my old house .
doesn &apos;t make sense to go backwards .
hmm . look at me .
i &apos;d give anything to go backward .
mrs. florric , the judge is ready for you now .
here we go .
what is it about glasses ?
i seem to walk into a room , and they disappear .
your honor , this is not just about one suit .
this is about the class action
that lockhart &amp; gardner has in the wings ...
no , it is about one suit . we &apos;re asking for $ 5 million
for pain and suffering , loss of spousal support ...
you know , i used to carry around three or four pair of glasses .
at the end of the day ,
i was like a drunk looking for bottles . ugh !
you &apos;re paying , mr. hines .
by the evidence i &apos;ve seen , you &apos;re paying .
the only question is , how much ?
but you haven &apos;t seen this evidence .
what is it ?
grant duverney &apos;s medical report .
from 2009 . before the accident .
yes , but after his career as a professional hockey player .
what does that have to do with anything ?
modified comparative negligence .
if your client contributed to the accident--
in fact-- if he contributed more than 50 % to the accident--
then he can &apos;t sue us .
you &apos;re saying that he &apos;s responsible for his wife &apos;s death ?
i &apos;m saying , given his mental capacity
after 86 games as a professional hockey player--
body checks and fights--
he had no business getting on that snowmobile .
your honor , this ... is despicable .
and yet legal , counselor .
you &apos;re saying , counselor hines ,
that the plaintiff caused his own accident
by steering into a tree ?
i &apos;m saying , it contributed .
the plaintiff &apos;s apparent condition--
chronic traumatic encephalopathy--
was more than 50 % of the problem .
okay .
i &apos;ll be ordering an independent neurological evaluation on mr. duverney .
we &apos;ll see where that takes us .
basically , we &apos;re in trouble .
how can we be in trouble ? we were in negotiations on this .
they &apos;re going after his hockey career .
and judge rigby is giving them some rope .
so there &apos;s truth in their charges ?
grant played 86 games as a pro hockey player ,
and in his 86th start , he was in a fight on the ice ,
and ended up in the hospital .
he never played again . his motor functions were impaired .
so , there might be truth .
and how did we not see this coming ?
do you have a minute ?
so , this was my case .
yes .
and supposedly , a winner .
which it still is ,
but i have some strategic information
i could ... share with you .
if it weren &apos;t for the restrictions of your suspension ?
yes , which , as i understand it ,
prevents me from talking about future strategy , but not ...
past . that would be updating ?
which is within my rights .
yet , we seem to be in here whispering .
consulting .
what do you got ?
bring hockey into it .
into our case ?
yes . their defense is based on modified comparative negligence .
if our client is responsible for 50 % of his accident ,
he loses , but ...
if professional hockey is responsible for his injuries ,
then he can collect .
and this is your suggested strategy ?
it is .
well , diane ,
this is a mistake .
hockey will never pay .
to pay would be to open up themselves
to hundreds of lawsuits from former players .
it &apos;s part of the strategy . pull hockey into this .
they &apos;ll want to bury it quickly and quietly .
we found our deep pocket .
yes , and in addition , the aphl lawyers will delay .
so we &apos;ll get a three @-@ month continuance to build our case .
you want me on it ?
um , i do , but a low priority .
and , alicia , do you have a moment ?
yes .
so , we want to keep you happy here , alicia .
we value all your hard work these past few months .
thank you .
given that , the equity partners have agreed
on paper to a bump in your pay .
great .
uh , yes , but we want to be clear .
there are 11 other third @-@ year associates ,
so , we can &apos;t afford an across @-@ the @-@ board raise .
i understand .
so , here &apos;s what we &apos;re offering .
i know , it &apos;s not as much as you think you deserve ,
but take it as a demonstration of our confidence in your future .
thought you might want something .
no , thanks .
you don &apos;t know who &apos;s leaking
to the disciplinary board about me , do you ?
no . you want me to look ?
no . just if you hear anything .
you in trouble ?
sticking to the letter of the law .
you gonna leave me here with two beers ?
you &apos;ll find somebody .
what &apos;s up ?
you want a beer ?
no . thanks .
you &apos;re sure ?
it &apos;s open .
kalinda , i ...
i &apos;m sorry .
i can &apos;t help it . i want to move on , but i ...
yeah , i ... i get it .
look , we &apos;re working together .
that &apos;s good enough , isn &apos;t it ?
yeah .
it &apos;s just not easy for me ...
it &apos;s okay , alicia .
i get it .
i &apos;m louis canning , your honor .
i &apos;ll be representing the interests
of the all professional hockey league .
welcome , mr. canning .
you saw the amended complaint ?
i did , your honor ,
and a baroque piece of work it is .
baroque , and yet ,
if snow plain insists
on a modified comparative negligence defense ,
i see no other option than to offer the plaintiff
a chance to combine charges of negligence .
darn .
yes , your honor ,
we accept the modified complaint .
then i expect you &apos;ll be asking for an extension ?
oh , no , no , we &apos;re ready to go .
right now .
in fact , we welcome the chance
to defend the honor of professional hockey .
he thinks you &apos;re not prepared .
excuse me , will , you can &apos;t be saying anything .
we need to move quickly on all fronts .
i &apos;ll get on with kalinda .
that &apos;s cameron raker , minnesota &apos;s enforcer .
you just had to expect this .
a lot of bad blood between these two teams .
oh , my !
raker landed one square on .
he &apos;s flat on ...
there was a criminal battery investigation in 2009,
but charges were never brought .
it would be helpful to get that investigation .
i &apos;m on it .
good , and will has a friend
who &apos;s a top neurologist at northwestern .
a dr. wedd , he specializes in sports injuries .
he &apos;s agreed to testify as to
how team doctors mishandled grant .
i &apos;ll prep him .
great .
mr. canning thinks he &apos;s caught us off guard .
let &apos;s show him he hasn &apos;t , hmm ?
hi , marina , i &apos;ve decided against the house .
i just don &apos;t have the money for the down payment .
yes , i &apos;ll call if anything changes ,
but i don &apos;t think it will .
this is me in reporter mode .
ah , very impreivive . how was london ?
london @-@ y ?
how was here ?
you &apos;re looking pretty casual today .
a lot has happened .
i &apos;m gonna be taping this , if that &apos;s all right .
it is , but i don &apos;t have much to say .
sporting news has me covering this hockey lawsuit .
i &apos;m just wondering , are you crazy ?
going up against hockey ?
here &apos;s the problem , miss linnata .
it was my suit ,
but i &apos;ve had a little legal trouble of my own ,
and i &apos;ve been suspended from practicing law for six months .
you ?
really ?
what happened ?
i cut some corners .
i &apos;m a corner @-@ cutter .
ah , so this is a 12 @-@ step program ?
yes , step three , admitting my faults .
i had to hand off the case to other fine lawyers here ,
so you probably want to ask julius cain
whether he &apos;s crazy to go after hockey .
and who &apos;s the other lawyer ?
what ?
you said there were two lawyers .
who &apos;s the other lawyer ?
alicia florrick .
oh ... yes .
alicia . how is she doing ?
good .
good .
i &apos;m so glad for her .
well , it &apos;s good seeing you , will .
you &apos;re looking good .
thank you . you are , too .
good luck with your other nine steps .
the league ended up suspending cameron raker
for the rest of the season ,
so the state &apos;s attorney at the time ,
peter florrick ,
thought it wasn &apos;t worth pursuing .
but what was the charge gonna be ?
i mean , why was this treated different
than any other fight on the ice ?
well , the concussion was severe ,
and we were looking into it being a premeditated hit .
raker targeted our client ?
the whole team targeted your client .
any chance i could see the investigative report on that ?
or just a peek ?
funny that you &apos;ve been sent here and not kalinda .
i volunteered .
really ?
why ?
i don &apos;t know .
how are you doing ?
well , i &apos;m not in the deputy &apos;s office .
yes , i , um ... i wasn &apos;t gonna say anything .
things have changed . self @-@ inflicted wound .
are you safe ?
nobody &apos;s told me otherwise ,
and that usually means no .
thank you .
cameron raker .
i am a professional ice hockey left @-@ winger .
and you &apos;re the team &apos;s enforcer ?
objection , your honor , that &apos;s not an official hockey position .
mrs. florrick is just using the term to bias these proceedings .
i don &apos;t understand , what &apos;s the bias ?
well , an enforcer is someone on a hockey team who responds
to supposedly dirty plays from the opposing team
by attacking aggressively ...
and thank you , mrs. florrick , for that biased definition .
well , do you want me to explain the bias or not ?
okay , thank you .
i am enlightened without bias .
mr. raker ,
what is the official title for your position ?
uh , left wing .
okay , that &apos;s what we &apos;ll call it from now on .
left wing .
and i ...
mr. raker ...
in your capacity as a left @-@ winger ,
did your coach ever ask you to violently respond to a dirty play ?
he asked me to check offenders who crossed the line , you know ?
and has he ever asked you to take a player out ?
if you mean &quot; out &quot; by checking those offenders legally ,
then yes .
that &apos;s christian lund , your teammate ,
the star player under contract for 6.3 million ?
yeah .
i &apos;m sorry ,
i &apos;ve got to come closer ; i can &apos;t see .
oh , certainly , your honor .
and who is that who took out your star player ?
him .
oh , devastating hit by duverney on lund .
and the best man on the ice is taken down by a fourth @-@ liner .
was your team outraged by this hit , mr. raker ?
i wouldn &apos;t say we were outraged . we were concerned .
lund is pretty important to us .
but did you see this postgame interview ?
you hit us like that , it &apos;s not over .
we &apos;ve got your number , duverney .
we &apos;ll see you in february .
nope , didn &apos;t see it .
but isn &apos;t that your jersey , mr. raker ,
in the background within earshot of this interview ?
looks like it . i @-@ i don &apos;t remember .
and by , &quot; we &apos;ll see you in february , &quot;
did your coach mean the next time
you were playing against my client &apos;s team ?
i don &apos;t know , could have meant anything , really .
but didn &apos;t it mean this game on february 15 ?
i don &apos;t know .
maybe . i guess .
we &apos;ve got a problem here .
no , it &apos;s your neurologist friend at northwestern ,
dr. wedd , the one we want to hire for the trial .
he says he &apos;s never heard of you .
he what ?
yeah , he said he was too busy to talk ,
and then he just rushed out of the office .
you know what i think ?
yeah , &apos; cause i &apos;m thinking it , too .
canning got to him .
paid him off .
do we have a second @-@ best option ?
no , not for hockey impact studies .
you may have another play .
given that i can &apos;t suggest new legal strategy ,
i think you &apos;ll know what i &apos;m about to say .
find out if canning paid him off ,
and see if we can prove fraud .
obviously , i can &apos;t comment ,
but it sounds like you &apos;re in movement .
i am . following your neurologist friend
see if he &apos;s going to meet up with canning .
obviously , i can &apos;t comment .
i will keep you in the loop .
not at my urging .
bye .
okay , let me know when you find out more .
back to our old ways , are we ?
and what ways might those be ?
paying off our neurological expert .
are you happy at lockhart &amp; gardner , mrs. florrick ?
i am happy .
you don &apos;t look happy . uh @-@ huh .
why are you second chair to julius when you &apos;re doing all the heavy lifting ?
because julius is an equity partner .
and you &apos;re not ; why is that ?
okay . here &apos;s the problem .
i see how we treat lawyers who are poached .
they &apos;re the first ones out the door .
they &apos;re the ones we don &apos;t trust ,
and that is why i will not be poached .
the problem at lockhart &amp; gardner is they treat it like a family .
they treat loyalty as an absolute good .
and it &apos;s not ?
at home it is ;
at work it &apos;s talent and professionalism that matter .
that &apos;s why i don &apos;t hold a grudge .
you come and work for me ,
you &apos;ll be judged on the value of your work and only your work .
let me make you an offer .
no .
afraid mommy and daddy at lockhart &amp; gardner might get upset ?
i &apos;ll see you in court .
see you in court .
and , dr. rubich , as the team doctor ,
you were the first to assess grant &apos;s injuries ?
yes , i examided grant in the dressing room right after the fight .
and you tested him for symptoms of concussion ?
yes .
how long was the examination ?
about 15 minutes .
and then you cleared him to get back into the game ?
he seemed fine .
he , uh , even made a pretty hard check in the last minute .
saved the team a goal .
and yet , three days later ,
he was in the hospital and never played again .
yes , that &apos;s my understanding .
when you conducted my client &apos;s exit physical ,
what did you write in the file in regard to head injuries ?
i didn &apos;t write anything .
i saw no need to .
dr. rubich , what &apos;s a baseline test ?
it &apos;s a neuro @-@ psychological test we run on players
before the start of the season .
in the event they suffer a head injury during a game ,
we can determine if it &apos;s a concussion
by comparing the results .
and did you perform those tests on grant duverney
after he was knocked down by cameron raker ?
yes , and the results were identical with the baseline .
there were no signs of brain trauma .
so , in other words , you did your job ?
yes .
thank you , doctor .
we need our neurologist .
kalinda thinks he &apos;ll meet with canning after court .
hello ?
diane ?
kalinda ?
yeah ,
guess who our neurologist is with ?
canning ?
no , not canning .
frank michael thomas .
what , the actor ?
and the lawyer .
i don &apos;t understand , what does he have to do with hockey ?
i have no idea , but i thought
you should come down and talk to him .
no , i can &apos;t right now .
um , just take some pictures and ...
uh , yeah , just do what you normally do .
i &apos;ll talk to you .
just call alicia and will .
hello , jack .
shall i assume you &apos;re 40 minutes late
because of australian standard time ?
i wish it were the case .
i also wish you won &apos;t hate me
when i tell you i have a complication .
another time , diane , i promise .
just tell me you don &apos;t hate me .
i don &apos;t hate you .
go uncomplicate your complication .
you &apos;ve reached the personal voice mail of kurt mcveigh .
i &apos;m unavailable right ...
can i have the check , please ?
yes ?
oh , i &apos;m sorry . i , uh ...
i @-@ is this ... ?
are you here to see kurt ?
uh , yes .
i hope i &apos;m not , uh ...
no , come in .
diane .
hello .
and surprise .
after what , a year ?
did you just happen to be in the neighborhood ?
no . uh , but i think
i should call the cab back and return to mine .
good @-@ bye .
it &apos;s a 40 @-@ mile drive .
and that &apos;s when i found my voice .
acting is all about the voice .
well , will gardner .
how you doing ? good , sir .
till i found you stole our neurologist .
really ?
i didn &apos;t realize he was in a position to be stolen .
nice to meet you , ladies .
so you &apos;re working for louis canning now ?
nope .
you &apos;re suing hockey ?
yep .
class action , seven players .
head injuries ?
yep .
aphl &apos;s been mishandling head injuries
ever since the first time they strapped a metal blade
to the underside of a boot .
i &apos;m hoping to make it right for these players .
then join us .
pool our resources .
make the league fight a multifront war .
well , i appreciate the offer , but , uh , my answer &apos;s got to be :
not a chance in hell .
louis canning is using your case
to establish legal precedent before i file mine .
whupping you makes it easier for him to fight me .
which is why he was prepared and so eager to rush to court .
yep . well , good luck .
hockey will be fighting you to the last man .
and you &apos;re going to lose .
you &apos;re going to lose bad .
at least we &apos;re offering a choice .
unlike your socialist , fascist campaign ,
ours is a horse race . with four hobbled horses .
not too hobbled to beat your man , obama .
did you think we were going to listen
to the gray hairs , hand it to romney ?
bloody battle &apos;s healthy-- fires people up .
yes , particularly billionaires
putting down payments on candidates .
ah , the highland park liberal .
cries foul about the evil republican super pacs
as she writes a check to obama &apos;s .
shall we drink to your allegedly non @-@ activist supreme court ?
right . scalia , alito , the rest of the big , scary five .
four . we &apos;re wearing kennedy down .
all part of our clever highland park liberal plan .
well , i would love to stay and keep proving you wrong ,
but i &apos;ve got an early forensics class ,
and my instructor here gets surly
if we &apos;re late , so ...
it was nice meeting you , diane .
and you , miranda . keep breathing that fire .
see you tomorrow , kurt .
yeah .
oh , she &apos;s wonderful .
crack shot , too .
crime labs will be climbing all over each other to hire her .
so she &apos;s your ...
protege ?
you could call her that .
well , you two certainly are of , uh , like minds .
except i like a good argument .
consensus is less ...
interesting .
hello .
is this a regular thing ?
dropping in on men you haven &apos;t seen in a year ?
i could use some direction here .
wh- what exactly is this ?
it &apos;s me missing you .
and hoping you feel likewise .
the real estate lady called .
she thinks that they &apos;ll take ten percent down .
what ?
the real estate lady should not be telling you that .
she &apos;s calling here because she wants
to get you two excited about the house .
no , she was just being nice .
i &apos;ll talk to her . she should not be calling here .
you &apos;re really trying to make it work , huh ?
i don &apos;t know .
i- i knew they &apos;d come after me .
i was a marked man .
because of your check in that first game on their star ,
christian lund ?
yes .
cameron raker was six @-@ foot @-@ three , 225 pounds .
how big were you , grant ?
five @-@ eleven , 190 .
yet , when he goaded you ,
you fought him .
i had no choice .
if ... if i hadn &apos;t fought ,
they would have gone after one of our star players .
how can you be so sure ?
&apos;cause we would have done the same thing .
it &apos;s ... it &apos;s the game .
no further questions .
first , let me start by saying
how sorry i am about your recent medical developments .
if i can offer some advice from personal experience :
one day at a time .
thank you .
so this baseline test the doctor gave you
at the start of the season-- did you fake yours ?
did- did i ... ?
i &apos;m- i- i don &apos;t ... i &apos;m not sure i understand ...
weren &apos;t you told by a teammate to fake the test ?
you know , tap on the keyboard a little slower
or mix up the numbers on the test grid .
that way , if you suffered a head injury during a game ,
the team doctors would see similar results
and clear you to play .
objection .
hearsay .
my apologies , your honor .
i should have submitted this
evidence deposition from one anthony murillo ,
who was mr. duverney &apos;s roommate during his rookie season .
mr. duverney , one more time .
did you fake your baseline test ?
yes .
so , if you hadn &apos;t faked your test ,
they would have been able to diagnose you and treat you properly .
objection-- beyond the witness &apos;s expertise .
withdrawn . no ... no further questions , your honor .
grant , why did you fake your baseline test ?
for the same reason a lot of players do :
i was afraid of losing my job .
what are you doing right now ?
diane has me on something . what do you need ?
how quickly can you upload a video online ?
no fingerprints .
mrs. florrick .
my driver is still at the dentist .
can i get a lift ?
how much flexibility is there ?
well , we offer telecommuting .
and then there &apos;s day care at work .
no , uh , i have an issue .
my apartment has gone condo ,
and i have the possibility of purchasing a house .
and you need money for the down payment ?
yes , and a consistent higher level in pay .
i have private tuition , and i &apos;m trying to save for college .
i &apos;ll work up an offer .
no . no , i &apos;m fine .
clearly , you &apos;re not fine , or we wouldn &apos;t be sitting here .
mr. canning , seriously , i &apos;m fine .
all right , let &apos;s leave it at this .
i &apos;ll work up an offer .
you &apos;ll think about it .
we &apos;ll talk on the phone later .
and that &apos;s it-- no pressure .
nobody &apos;s doing anything wrong here , alicia .
this is how america works .
so you &apos;re familiar with this web site ?
yes . rinkfights.com.
it &apos;s not sanctioned for our league .
well , then , you &apos;re aware that it lets fans vote
on who will win the fight ,
that the players actually have fight cards
with win @-@ loss records ?
yes .
as aphl &apos;s chief administrative officer ,
you have the final say over league copyright issues ,
correct ?
i do .
the clips the web site plays are game broadcasts .
do you grant them permission to use these ?
absolutely not .
as i said , this is not an aphl @-@ sanctioned web site .
let &apos;s talk about another web site that uses your clips .
this is a recent boston @-@ detroit game .
it was posted online yesterday by an employee of our firm .
do you know how long it took the webmaster
to receivea cease and desist order from your office ?
no .
two hours , and
in the eight years since rinkfights.com has been online ,
how many cease and desist letters have you issued them ?
none .
is that because you encourage fans &apos; enthusiasm for fights ?
no , of course not .
then why aren &apos;t you removing these fight videos ?
well , i guess we &apos;ll start .
thank you for the encouragement .
and thank you for that damaging testimony .
objection .
sustained
i think we should all have a little sit @-@ down .
about ?
me help you win this thing .
the truth-- are you in bed with him ?
am i in bed with him ?
yeah . that &apos;s what i &apos;ve been hearing from unnamed sources .
i can neither confirm nor deny
that we have any formal agreement with frank michael thomas .
and you don &apos;t think suits like yours and mr. thomas &apos;s
will hurt the sport of ice hockey ?
no . is fighting essential to the sport of ice hockey ?
some think it &apos;s a safety valve .
without it , you &apos;d see a lot more sticks swinging out there .
not in college hockey .
not in the olympics . you would get ejected .
but aren &apos;t the stakes a little higher in the pros ?
players &apos; livelihoods are on the line .
then why are there no real fights
during the championship series ?
sounds like your closing argument .
thanks .
no problem .
if you need any more , you should talk to julius .
so you were in london , right ?
setting up your magazine &apos;s operation for the olympics ?
yes .
how was it ?
rainy .
you slept with will after i left town , didn &apos;t you ?
i promise you he didn &apos;t tell me .
will didn &apos;t put up much of a fight
when i told him about the london offer .
and then i e @-@ mailed him right after i got there , but no response .
i chalked it up to his being so busy ,
but will never not responds .
i knew you two had history , so ...
two plus two .
i think that &apos;s a conversation you should have with will .
you &apos;re right .
inappropriate of me .
you know , for the record ,
it wasn &apos;t over between will and i
when i left for london .
then you slept with him , and it was over .
we appreciate the change of heart .
we could use whatever help you can give us .
shouldn &apos;t we wait for ms. lockhart
before getting to brass tacks ?
i understood she was gonna be a part of this .
diane got pulled away on another case .
but we &apos;ll bring her up to speed .
so be it .
don &apos;t look at this as a benevolent gesture--
i just think you folks did a hell of a job in court today ,
and it looks like helping you might actually help me after all .
um , i &apos;m sorry , would you excuse me , please ?
of course .
now , you just promise me this--
when you use this against louis canning ,
try to draw blood .
we &apos;re adding a witness , dr. andrea wedd .
and you &apos;re telling me in accordance to court rules .
very honorable of you .
dr. wedd is a neurologist ...
who has repeatedly lambasted the league
for its approach to head injuries .
i &apos;ve read all his articles .
he has a unique gift for repeating himself .
what dr. wedd is testifying to isn &apos;t in any of his articles .
really ?
dr. wedd approached the league with a rigorous protocol
for evaluating and treating players with head injuries--
one that wouldn &apos;t scare players into faking baseline tests .
had the league not dismissed dr. wedd so quickly ,
grant duverney would have been properly diagnosed and treated .
i can show you the rejection e @-@ mail
that dr. wedd received from the league vp .
it &apos;s a quick read .
i &apos;ll run it by the league ,
see what they want to do .
one more thing .
you have 24 hours .
fishing ?
at horsetail lake .
it &apos;s an easy drive from the city .
we &apos;d make it a day trip .
kurt , have we met ?
i &apos;ll do all the baiting .
oh , would you have it any other way ?
we pack a lunch , we rent a boat ,
and we breathe something other than car exhaust for a few hours ,
and the good news for you--
cell phone coverage .
hold on a second .
you don &apos;t hate me , right ?
uh , jack ?
uh , hello .
i said i &apos;d take you out some other time ,
so i &apos;m calling to find out that other time .
uh ... when do you have in mind ?
i was thinking friday night .
unwind after work .
i , uh ... can you hold on a second ?
kurt ?
no , jack .
oh , hold on a second .
who &apos;s kurt ?
he &apos;s j ... he &apos;s just a @-@ a business associate .
uh , i @-@ i will be right back , uh ...
jack .
jack . hold on .
hello ?
look , if horsetail lake doesn &apos;t cut it for you , then ...
no , no , no . it sounds fun .
when were you ... thinking ?
saturday morning . pick you up at 8 : 00 .
perfect . i will see you then . bye .
still there ?
yep .
friday night sounds good .
it &apos;s pretty darn hard being on the outside looking in , huh ?
i &apos;m just sitting here watching the wheels turn round and round .
what do you need , eli ?
i did not leak to the disciplinary board .
but you &apos;re gonna tell me who did ?
i can tell you my suspicions .
david lee .
yup .
that &apos;s funny .
david lee was in here yesterday
saying you leaked it .
he did not .
he did .
no .
no , you &apos;re playing us against each other .
as long as we &apos;re fighting each other ,
you &apos;re safe .
i don &apos;t think i &apos;ll ever be ... safe .
it &apos;s good talking to you , eli .
excuse me , diane ?
uh , yes , alicia ?
i have received a formal job offer from louis canning .
from canning ?
he approached me several months ago and i declined ,
but he &apos;s been persistent .
and you &apos;re considering it ?
i &apos;d like to stay , but his offer ...
would go a long way to helping me cover a mortgage payment .
it wasn &apos;t louis canning who gave you a chance
after 13 years away from the law .
this is his offer .
if i stay at the firm , it has to be more .
you &apos;ll give me till the end of the week ?
no .
i can &apos;t .
yep , everybody changes .
end of the week , alicia ,
or you can clean out your desk right now .
you &apos;ve heard nothing ?
no text , no e @-@ mail , nothing .
i would &apos;ve thought canning would want to end this ,
keep the league from getting skewered in court .
fine , put dr. wedd on the stand .
mr. cain ,
do you have a minute ?
can it wait until after court ?
there is no court .
i just spoke to judge rigby .
the snow plain corporation has reevaluated its position
on the original case .
we &apos;re now prepared to settle .
w @-@ well , we &apos;re way beyond that point , mr. hines .
the only acceptable number is the full $ 5 million .
good . because that &apos;s what we &apos;re offering .
talk to your client and let me know .
what just happened ?
i think we just won .
no ! no , no , no , no !
no bonus !
she just won a case .
alicia did not win a case-- she was handed a settlement .
which we wouldn &apos;t have gotten but for her performance .
oh , forgive me , miyagi , i forgot who was guiding alicia .
and since when do you have a problem
with winning money for clients ?
oh , who cares about the client ! will !
tell them how disastrous it would be if alicia walks .
i don &apos;t care what she &apos;s paid .
i just can &apos;t afford to lose another body right now .
look , we all know the issue .
why don &apos;t we just put it to a vote .
all those in favor ...
no .
she &apos;s getting her bonus .
i &apos;m invoking managing @-@ partner prerogative .
you can &apos;t be serious .
mm , what are we talking about ?
the firm &apos;s bylaws allow the managing partner to act unilaterally .
under extenuating circumstances .
we must have missed the memo .
apparently , we &apos;re now stalin &amp; associates .
well , if it means alicia sticks around ,
i second it .
you can &apos;t second it .
the matter is closed .
any other business ?
you just stuck your neck out for a third @-@ year associate .
your suspension has left us exposed .
i stuck my neck out for the future of this firm .
i &apos;m not sure what time i can get out tonight .
but thank you very much , mr. canning .
is something wrong ?
you used me .
no .
the firm made it attractive for me to stay .
it was unexpected .
unexpected as a knife in the back .
y ... you should still be pleased .
you did well for your client .
whatever deal you cut with snow plain
deflects any liability away from the league .
no , i &apos;m pleased--
because i needed to smoke frank michael thomas out ,
find out what he had for his class action .
and thanks to your good lawyering , now i know ,
and i &apos;ll be ready for him .
so i guess what i want to say to you , alicia ,
is thank you .
thank you .
anything you have would be really helpful .
okay . okay , good .
thanks .
the other day when you brought the beer ,
i wasn &apos;t ...
it &apos;s all right .
they were warm , anyway .
look , i can &apos;t go back to the way it was before .
there &apos;s just been too much .
i know .
but ...
i &apos;d like to try to make it work .
it &apos;s just that everything ...
it has to be ...
on the table .
i can &apos;t be the only one being forthcoming .
i can &apos;t be the only one being honest .
can .... you do that ?
yeah .
okay .
