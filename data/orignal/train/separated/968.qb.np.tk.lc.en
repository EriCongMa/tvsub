desperate housewives s06e02
previously on desperate housewives ...
it was a joyous occasion until ...
did i miss anything ?
i &apos;m asking you nicely to leave .
if you don &apos;t , i will drag you out of this church myself .
i don &apos;t love these babies .
lynette struggled with her pregnancy .
stop saying that .
gaby made a commitment ...
i am now officially your guardian .
and bree ...
i &apos;m married .
to a man who &apos;s blackmailing you .
jumped in with both feet .
i think we could be happy here ,
right , danny ?
new neighbors ...
would you like to go to a movie sometime ?
moved in .
look , danny , please let me explain .
go to hell .
what &apos;s gotten into that kid ?
he &apos;s a teenager .
go look for him .
and evil made an appearance on wisteria lane .
the first time karen mccluskey saw roy bender ,
she did something she didn &apos;t expect to do .
she smiled .
the next time they met ,
roy did something he didn &apos;t expect to do .
he smiled back .
after a week of sly flirtations ,
karen and roy did something no one expected them to do .
and they did it twice .
with each passing day ,
karen began to feel something she hadn &apos;t felt in years ,
and she realized she needed to know
if roy was feeling the same way .
has it been an hour yet ?
14 minutes .
come on . your doctor said you need to walk an hour a day .
the little snot nose--
i &apos;d like to drop dead just to piss him off .
don &apos;t even joke about that .
i like having you around . i like it a lot .
you remember to put the seat down .
you can drive at night .
a girl could get used to that .
how many minutes has it been now ?
i &apos;m trying to tell you how i feel , roy .
i didn &apos;t expect this .
i always thought that ...
you just get one big love in this lifetime ,
and that was my husband gilbert .
and after he died , i figured the rest of my life
was about making meatloaf for one .
then you come along and ...
i love you , roy .
isn &apos;t there anything you wanna say to me ?
you know how i feel .
a woman needs to hear the words .
all right .
here we go .
what the hell ? !
oh , my god !
are you all right ? !
we gotta call 9 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 !
for a moment , mrs. mccluskey didn &apos;t move .
and whether it was her boyfriend &apos;s discovery
of julie mayer
or her realization
that he wasn &apos;t going to say the words
she desperately needed to hear ,
karen mccluskey suddenly felt the urge to ...
ten minutes earlier
it was a shame what happened that day ,
considering how nicely the morning had begun .
one neighbor was out reading the sports section ,
delighted to see that his team had won .
a child was playing with her new doll ,
thrilled to discover just how durable it was .
and a woman was walking with the man she adored ,
determined to say she loved him for the very first time .
yes , up until the screaming started ,
people thought it was going to be a wonderful day .
oh , good . you &apos;re up .
uh , yeah .
good mornin &apos; .
good morning .
did you go to sleep with a breath mint in your mouth ?
this is our first morning
waking up as husband and wife again .
i wanted it to be perfect .
well , it couldn &apos;t be more perfect .
mmm ... yes , it could .
here &apos;s a breath mint for you .
did we really get married last night ?
either that , or we paid a lot of money
to watch our friends get drunk .
come here , mrs. delfino .
all right .
we have a honeymoon to get started .
hey , whatcha doin &apos; ?
uh , nothing , sweetie .
why don &apos;t you go play in your room for ten minutes ?
ten ?
i wanna play in here .
okay .
of course you can .
in fact , i can &apos;t think of a better way
to start our new life together--
all of us here , julie &apos;s home .
you know , the last couple years ,
when i used to think about what i needed to be happy ,
this was it .
this was the picture i had in my head .
hey , danny . it &apos;s ana .
did you get my message about going to the mall later ?
oh , okay . that &apos;s cool . um , how about tomorrow ?
yeah , me too . the mall blows .
well , give me a call if you wanna hang .
shot you down , huh ?
i could get danny bolen anytime i want .
okay . well , let me know if you need any help .
not that i need your help , but ...
what do you got ?
here &apos;s the secret to landing a guy
you have to ignore them .
you are the one who ends the conversation .
you are the one too busy to get together .
and ?
and that &apos;s it . trust me , it works .
how do you think i played this one ?
you did not play me .
like a fiddle .
you know how many runway shows he sat through
before i would even look at him ? six .
it wasn &apos;t that many .
six .
and when he finally asked me out , i said , &quot; okay . &quot;
but then at the last minute ,
i backed out , saying i didn &apos;t feel well .
you weren &apos;t really sick ?
god , no .
i had a pedicure and then went to sardi &apos;s for drinks .
after that , he was my slave .
i rented a yacht that day !
really ? that &apos;s hilarious .
a week later , he gave me this .
i lost that deposit !
eat your waffles ! i &apos;m teaching !
look at you .
i know . martha friggin &apos; stewart , eh ?
hey , ana . yeah . i &apos;m-- i &apos;m not much of a @-@ a mall guy .
yeah .
but , uh , i &apos;ll see you around , okay ?
yep . mornin &apos; .
where were you last night ?
out .
yeah , where &quot; out &quot; ?
i drove around lookin &apos; for you .
i couldn &apos;t sleep . i went a lot of places .
happy now ?
hey ! don &apos;t be a wiseass .
we were worried about you .
nick , go take your shower .
go .
12 oranges for a half a cup of juice ? that &apos;s worth it .
no , thanks .
okay , so we &apos;re sticking with the moody teenager thing , huh ?
come on . what &apos;d you do last night ?
i already told dad .
i went out .
danny , it &apos;s me .
what did i do when peter spadaro
pushed you off the swing set in first grade , huh ?
i threw a slushee in his mom &apos;s face .
clearly , i have your back . talk to me .
i went out drinking .
there &apos;s nothing else to do here , mom .
look ...
i know this move has been hard on you ,
but try to make the best of it , okay ?
trust me , it takes a lot more effort to be unhappy .
okay .
thanks for being honest .
and that &apos;s for drinking .
mom , was that you throwing up
in the bathroom this morning ?
uh ... yeah . i was just feeling a little nauseous .
mm , sick in the morning .
if you weren &apos;t so old ,
i &apos;d say you were pregnant .
okay , guys ,
here &apos;s the deal .
i had some bad seafood last night .
at the wedding ? we had chicken .
i mean after that .
i went out to get gas , and i had ...
clams .
i don &apos;t even remember where i ate them .
i just remember seeing this sign that said &quot; clams , &quot;
and i thought ,
&quot; ooh , i haven &apos;t had clams for a while . &quot;
so i went in and had clams ,
but they were bad ,
which is why i was throwing up .
well , my point was , next time , please flush .
and i &apos;m done with my oatmeal .
what ?
we said we weren &apos;t gonna tell the kids
until after the first trimester .
that &apos;s next friday .
wow , you actually know the day .
wow , you &apos;re really into this .
well , someone has to be .
i &apos;m not telling anybody until we &apos;re absolutely sure
everything &apos;s okay .
really ?
are you sure that &apos;s the only reason you &apos;re not telling them ?
i can &apos;t open my eyes all the way . who is it ?
did someone have too much wine at the wedding ?
i don &apos;t know . i was too drunk to notice .
i &apos;m sorry to bother you . i &apos;m just looking for bree .
oh , she &apos;s not here .
oh . where &apos;d she go ?
i don &apos;t know .
i just woke up , and she was already gone .
she &apos;s not in the test kitchen ?
no . i just wanted to let her know i &apos;m taking the morning off .
oh. well , i &apos;m sure she &apos;ll understand ,
given all you &apos;ve been through .
what do you mean ?
well , you know , mike and susan getting married .
oh , i &apos;m not upset about that .
really ?
oh . good . i &apos;m glad .
i mean , it &apos;s not as if it &apos;s gonna last .
excuse me ?
oh , mike doesn &apos;t really love susan .
he just feels sorry for her .
he &apos;ll be back .
my thoughts exactly .
that ... was amazing .
yeah .
who knew you were such a wild woman ?
i &apos;m not . i &apos;ve never done this before .
well , you are a fast learner .
no .
i mean , sex for me has always had to have
an emotional , romantic or even spiritual dimension .
i can see now you can take all of that away and it &apos;s still ...
marvelous recreation .
the best there is .
except , of course , when you actually tried to--
i &apos;m sorry .
i mean , really .
well , some people like it .
you &apos;ve done this a lot , haven &apos;t you ?
you don &apos;t stay this good by skipping practice .
god , you &apos;re a pig . kiss me .
hold that thought .
well , that &apos;s weird . it &apos;s mike .
hello ?
hey , karl , listen .
there &apos;s no easy way to say this ,
but something &apos;s happened to julie .
i mean , she was just lying there .
what if we hadn &apos;t found her in time ?
thank god you did .
how could this happen ?
i mean , julie &apos;s , like , the nicest girl in the world .
i know . who &apos;d want to hurt her ?
okay , i gotta go .
we &apos;ll call you from the hospital
as soon as we hear anything .
tell susan and mike we &apos;ll take good care of m.j.
this is insane .
how could someone strangle julie ?
i know , and on our property . it could &apos;ve been me .
i &apos;ve never had much upper body strength .
i &apos;d love to say he means well , but ...
what are you looking at ?
well , this horrible thing happened .
we &apos;re all out here trying to make sense of it .
where are they ?
oh , they were out here ...
for a minute .
you know , when you think about it ,
how much do we even know about these people ?
not much . they &apos;re from new york . they have a son ...
danny , who i saw
coming out of a movie the other night with julie .
seriously ? like a date ?
sure looked that way .
you know , when women are attacked ,
the police look at the husbands or the boyfriends first .
maybe it &apos;s time that we get to know our new neighbors .
okay , they are all looking at our place ,
and i do not think they are admiring our azaleas .
why are they staring at us ?
oh , let &apos;s see . uh , we &apos;re the new people on the block ,
mrs. mccluskey saw you fightin &apos; with julie ,
and , uh , this morning , she turns up almost dead .
what , are you kidding me ?
i had nothing to do with that .
i like julie .
then what were you fightin &apos; about ?
nothin &apos; . it &apos;s personal .
you &apos;re not gettin &apos; how serious this is .
if that old lady talks to the cops ,
we got problems .
okay , okay . danny ,
just tell me where you went
when you were drinking last night .
i keep trying to remember .
i ... i think i was at the park .
i drove by the park . you weren &apos;t there .
i drank a lot , okay ? it &apos;s a little fuzzy .
that &apos;s great , danny , you know ?
that &apos;s really great .
all right , if anybody asks ,
let &apos;s just say he was home with us .
no , because if anybody saw him out ,
we &apos;re done .
maybe the old lady won &apos;t talk to the cops .
uh , maybe i won &apos;t need an alibi .
danny , people are already lookin &apos; over here !
maybe that is because we are hiding in our house
like guilty people .
now i am going to make susan and mike a manicott &apos; .
and then we are going to get out there
and start hugging people .
the cops are going door @-@ to @-@ door asking questions .
won &apos;t be long before they &apos;re here .
what am i gonna tell them , huh ?
the truth--
that you saw that bolen kid fighting with julie .
well , it was just a couple of words .
they &apos;re kids . they argue . if i start pointing fingers ...
you &apos;re just telling &apos; em what you know .
what if i &apos;m wrong ?
i can &apos;t have another family on this street hating me .
who hates you ?
oh , the gay guys . i &apos;ve said stuff .
listen to me .
you know you &apos;ve gotta do the right thing .
yeah .
but you don &apos;t have to do it alone .
i &apos;m gonna be right here with ya . and ...
there was something i wanted to say before ,
and i didn &apos;t get the chance .
if you got hit by a bus ,
i &apos;d really miss you .
that &apos;s it ?
okay .
you &apos;re showering alone tonight .
all right , i love you .
there .
i said it .
do you mean it , or is that just your beta @-@ blockers talkin &apos; ?
we &apos;ll find out in an hour .
so you can &apos;t think of anyone
who would want to hurt your daughter ?
no , i told you .
she &apos;s a great kid . everybody
loves her . where &apos;s the doctor ?
he &apos;ll be here as soon as he can .
was she dating anyone ?
no .
you sure ?
yes , i &apos;m sure . if she was dating somebody , i would know .
he said he would be here .
mrs. delfino , i know how difficult this is for you .
really ? has your daughter been attacked ?
hey , um , you know what ?
how about we do this after she talks to the doctor ?
okay .
oh ! susan ! how is she ?
we don &apos;t know yet . uh , nobody &apos;s talking to us .
do you need somebody to take care of m.j. ?
uh , bob and lee are watching him . thanks .
mrs. delfino ?
dr. hill , what is going on ?
she &apos;s still unconscious .
i &apos;d like to run some tests
to make sure there &apos;s no internal bleeding .
what kind of tests ?
blood work , some x @-@ rays .
um , can--can we go with you ?
of course .
can i talk to you ?
uh , we really need to move here .
i @-@ i @-@ i don &apos;t think you should give her an x @-@ ray .
lynette , just let him do his job .
julie &apos;s pregnant .
what ?
she might be . she &apos;s not sure .
what are you talking about ?
she told me .
it &apos;s no problem . i can give her an m.r.i.
there &apos;s no radiation , so it &apos;s safer for the baby .
hey , guys . what &apos;s up ?
uh , we &apos;re just taking some food over to mike and susan &apos;s .
you know , we feel so awful about what happened .
nick , you talk to the guys .
i &apos;m gonna get this over there
while it &apos;s still hot , okay ?
okay .
so , nick , after what happened to julie ,
we &apos;re thinking of starting up a neighborhood watch .
are you interested ?
yeah. yeah , yeah , of course .
great .
danny must be pretty shaken up .
he &apos;s--he &apos;s pretty close with julie , isn &apos;t he ?
i think we &apos;re all pretty shaken up .
weren &apos;t they , uh , dating , though ?
no , no , just friends .
uh , she was helpin &apos; him with some tutoring .
really ?
yeah .
&apos;cause some people saw them at the movies together .
like i said , just friends .
so this neighborhood watch thing--
is there , uh , gonna be a meeting ?
yeah , we &apos;ll let you know .
is this--is this really about the neighborhood watch ?
&apos;cause it seems like the only one you &apos;re watching is my kid .
honey !
it &apos;s your mother .
we &apos;re done .
right , guys ?
thanks , hon .
that , uh , didn &apos;t look like it was going so good .
yeah , they were asking about danny .
it &apos;s like you said they would .
then it is time to get our son an alibi .
katherine .
i saw you drive in .
uh , yeah , i just wanted to come home and take a shower
before i head back to the hospital .
look , i know things have been ... awkward lately .
but i heard about julie , and i wanted to do something .
thank you .
i know susan will appreciate it .
so ... how is julie ?
yeah , we don &apos;t know . they &apos;re still doing tests .
oh , god . i can &apos;t imagine what you &apos;re going through .
you have to stay strong , mike .
uh ... katherine ?
whoa , wait , wait . what are you doing ?
just letting you know i &apos;m here for you .
anytime .
come on in .
ana , there are two detectives here
who wanna ask you some questions .
what about ?
we &apos;re investigating the julie mayer assault .
where were you last night at approximately 11 o &apos;clock ?
oh , i can answer that . she was in her room .
we have a very strict 10 p.m. curfew .
actually , i was out .
what ? i saw you go into your room .
yeah , and then i climbed down
the trellis and i met a friend .
can i borrow your mace ?
please , ma &apos;am .
my tax dollars pay for it . i should get to use it .
who was the friend you met ?
danny bolen .
wait , danny bolen ?
as in the guy who blew you off this morning ?
yes. he &apos;s a friend . i want him to be more than a friend .
mr. bolen said that you stopped by a liquor store .
no. no , no . she &apos;s 16 . she doesn &apos;t drink .
yeah , we bought some beer .
how about a taser ? you guys must carry a taser .
can anybody verify your whereabouts ?
danny .
okay .
thanks for your time .
you know why kids are like this now ?
because you people won &apos;t let us hit them anymore .
if i find this bastard before the cops do ,
he won &apos;t need a trial
&apos;cause i &apos;ll kill him with my bare hands .
look , i know you &apos;re mad .
i don &apos;t want to hear anger in this room .
we need to stay positive for julie &apos;s sake .
do we even have a clue who did this ?
a jealous boyfriend , maybe ?
was she even seeing anyone ?
no , not that i know of .
hi . is this a bad time ?
no , no. come on in .
oh , how is she ?
still unconscious .
we &apos;re waiting for the test results .
karl .
bree .
you know , i need to talk to lynette .
i &apos;ll be back in ten minutes .
she must never ever know i slept with you .
bree , my daughter was attacked .
i &apos;ve got more to worry about
than susan getting mad at us .
of course . i &apos;m sorry .
look , i know we said we &apos;d get together this week ,
but till this all gets sorted out ,
i @-@ i need a little time .
i completely understand .
i do want to see you again .
really .
just not now .
okay .
dad ?
so what did they say ?
the doctors still don &apos;t know .
but she &apos;s not pregnant .
i &apos;m so sorry about that . i just had to say something .
what made you think that she might be ?
she told me .
a few days ago ,
i was out in my yard .
i was upset .
julie saw me and asked me what was wrong .
we started talking about stuff , and ...
it just came out .
th--and you didn &apos;t just ...
just immediately pick up the phone and call me ?
she asked me not to .
so who &apos;s the guy ?
i don &apos;t know .
she didn &apos;t say ?
all she said was she &apos;d gotten involved with someone
and that it was complicated .
complicated ? and that &apos;s the word she used ?
yeah .
because ... &quot; complicated &quot; means &quot; trouble , &quot;
so you knew that she was in trouble ,
and you chose not to come to me ?
like i said , julie asked me not to .
you are my friend , not hers .
after everything we &apos;ve been through ,
i cannot believe you would betray me like that .
that &apos;s not fair .
lynette , my daughter is hooked up to a machine ,
and a guy who is complicating her life--
a guy that i didn &apos;t even know about--
might &apos;ve put her there ,
so i don &apos;t need to be fair .
rreggie .
thanks for coming so quickly .
no problem , mrs. solis .
how are those two little precious ones ?
what ?
oh , my kids .
oh , you threw me off with &quot; precious . &quot;
they &apos;re the least of my problems .
we &apos;ve taken in a teenager .
ooh. sorry to hear it .
yeah , she &apos;s been using this to sneak out at night .
that &apos;s why i want you to take it down .
she climbed down this trellis ?
yeah , that &apos;s what she said .
okay . it &apos;s just that it &apos;s pretty beat up .
i wouldn &apos;t have thought
it could hold much more than those roses .
but then again , why would she lie ?
i &apos;ll get my tools .
i &apos;m telling you , she opened her eyes
for at least 10 or 15 seconds .
she called me &quot; dad . &quot;
i believe you .
well , what does it mean ?
well , in layman &apos;s terms ,
drifting in and out of consciousness
is better than fully comatose .
our main concern is the intracranial swelling .
in fact , if she wakes up ,
we may choose to induce coma .
well , why would you do that ?
the swelling will heal faster if she &apos;s unconscious .
but i &apos;m confident she &apos;ll recover .
thank god . i should find susan .
good lord . they need me in the e.r.
um , before you go , one quick question .
when julie wakes up ,
will she remember what she saw or heard
during the brief moment she was awake ?
i don &apos;t see why not .
but people in comas dream , don &apos;t they ?
she could wake up thinking she saw something odd
when really it was just a bizarre dream .
not very likely .
her brain is swollen . that has to cause hallucinations .
i once thought lauren bacall was in my bedroom ,
and that was just a high fever .
ma &apos;am , there &apos;s been a bus crash .
i need to go .
oh , i &apos;m sorry .
uh , talk to your friend .
you may be surprised what she remembers .
liar !
what ?
there is no way you crawled down that trellis ,
because i just tried to ,
and it collapsed on top of me .
what &apos;s your answer to that ?
i don &apos;t know .
pull back on the carbs and try again in two weeks ?
wh--
ana , this is serious .
why would you lie to the cops ?
did danny ask you to cover up for him ?
i &apos;m not covering up anything .
danny didn &apos;t do it .
well , the police think he did .
you don &apos;t know this kid .
i know him better than the cops .
you &apos;re just mad because i didn &apos;t take your advice .
what are you talking about ?
you told me to play hard to get ,
which is totally lame .
i figured out a way to make him owe me .
aiding and abetting ?
this is your solution on how to land a guy ?
who are you calling ?
the police .
no !
julie mayer is lying in a hospital bed right now ,
and danny might have put her there .
you &apos;re telling the truth .
bree , you &apos;re back .
i brought you your favorite biscotti .
aw , you are so sweet .
and i hear julie &apos;s doing better .
much better .
she &apos;s just sedated now .
the doctors are very optimistic .
oh , my , that is good news .
you know , i wanted to tell you again
how much i enjoyed your wedding ,
especially the part where you and katherine made peace .
well , i &apos;m glad someone enjoyed that .
but you are friends again , right ?
i mean , you said all those lovely things to her
in the church .
yeah , but it wasn &apos;t enough for katherine .
you know , i don &apos;t know where she gets off
being the injured party .
she took mike from me first .
but you and mike were divorced at the time .
and--and katherine was very lonely .
okay , rule number one of the female code--
never sleep with your friend &apos;s ex @-@ husband .
well , uh , perhaps she should &apos;ve seen
that you still had feelings for mike .
it would &apos;ve been different if she &apos;d slept with ...
oh , let &apos;s say for instance , karl .
karl ? oh , yeah , like that would ever happen .
no , katherine &apos;s a lady .
she &apos;s not one of those dumb skanks
that would fall for karl &apos;s come @-@ ons .
so you agree it would be different ?
much different .
worse .
worse ? why worse ?
because karl hurt me . he cheated and lied .
i mean , any friend who would know all that
and sleep with him anyway ?
i would never talk to her again .
i don &apos;t blame you for defending katherine .
but ...
i just don &apos;t need a friend like her in my life ,
especially when i have a friend like you .
orson . come in .
uh , i &apos;m getting everybody to sign a get well card .
we &apos;re sending it over to julie .
oh , that &apos;s nice .
i suppose i should sign it somewhere inconspicuous ,
given recent events .
i suppose .
by the way ,
this morning when i said
that mike and susan wouldn &apos;t last ?
i know you thought i was crazy .
no .
i didn &apos;t think that ...
exactly .
well , f.y.i. ,
i stopped by their house today with a casserole .
mike was there ... alone .
let &apos;s just say he was grateful .
very grateful .
why wouldn &apos;t he be ?
god , you have no ear for innuendo at all !
he made a pass at me .
with julie in the hospital and his marriage one day old ?
well ...
it may be the first day , but ..
he &apos;s clearing having second thoughts .
oh , and ..
please don &apos;t tell bree .
i &apos;d hate for this to get back to susan .
hey .
hey .
i hear julie opened her eyes . that &apos;s great .
yes . yes , it is .
i &apos;m sorry you &apos;re mad at me .
yeah , i &apos;m not mad .
i just can &apos;t understand
why she went to you instead of me .
that day that julie found me crying
the reason she opened up to me was because i told her that ...
and no one else can know about this ...
i &apos;m pregnant .
you are ?
that &apos;s amazing .
wait . why were you crying ?
oh ... pfft .
let &apos;s see. uh , i &apos;m in my 40s ,
my husband is back in school ,
i &apos;m the sole breadwinner ,
i don &apos;t know how
i &apos;m gonna do this whole baby thing again ,
and ...
also because ...
what ?
because i can &apos;t quiet that one voice in my mind
that keeps saying ...
maybe i shouldn &apos;t .
oh , honey .
yeah .
lynette , uh ...
you can do whatever you think it is you need to do .
yeah .
i know .
lucky me .
it &apos;s weird . everybody talks about a kid being a gift .
it &apos;s the only gift where you puke for nine months
before you receive it and then scream the day it arrives .
that &apos;s true .
but they are a gift , lynette .
i know that because ...
i spent the last few hours thinking that i was ...
gonna lose mine .
i realized that i would ...
trade everything i own ,
i would give everything i ever will have ,
for just one more day as julie &apos;s mom .
but i &apos;m not telling you what you should do .
actually , you are .
and i &apos;m glad you did .
i had some briefs to finish ,
but i &apos;d rather work here than at the office .
hey , bree. you &apos;re still here ?
oh , she &apos;s kept me company all day . is she a saint or what ?
mm . hey , lee . thanks for calling me back .
uh , i &apos;m just checking on m.j.
this has been the longest day of my life .
i thought i needed some time to myself .
i was wrong .
i @-@ i need you .
i booked our room at the motel .
here &apos;s the key .
if you could come by , even for just an hour ...
well , it would mean a lot to me .
please .
i @-@ i don &apos;t want to be alone tonight .
neither do i.
hey , gaby . hey , you got a minute ?
oh , i think i know why you &apos;re here ,
and believe me , i am as ticked off as you are .
angie ...
no , no , no , no .
danny should &apos;ve never kept your niece out so late .
when i found out , i kicked him so hard ,
he &apos;s still trying to get the shoe out of his butt .
it &apos;ll never happen again .
it never happened at all .
what ?
ana wasn &apos;t with danny last night .
she never left the house .
what are you talking about ?
she snuck out . danny bought her beer .
they both fessed up .
ana was lying .
well , why would she lie ?
because your son told her to .
well , maybe she was changing her tune
&apos;cause she didn &apos;t want to get in trouble with you .
no. no ! she &apos;s covering for danny .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re implying , but he &apos;s a good kid .
your niece is the one
that &apos;s been hounding him day and night .
hey , i &apos;m just trying to be nice here .
i &apos;m giving you a heads up that ana &apos;s taking her story back .
whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa. let &apos;s slow down here , okay ?
can i at least talk to the girl
before she goes pointin &apos; fingers ?
too late . she &apos;s talking to the police right now .
baby , i screwed up .
what happened ?
i never should &apos;ve told you
to ask that girl for an alibi .
did she talk to the cops ?
yeah , which means they should be here any second .
but i didn &apos;t do anything . i ...
we don &apos;t have time for that . you &apos;re a suspect .
they have the right to question you .
mum ...
just listen to me .
tell &apos;em you will not waive your miranda rights .
and we will have a lawyer down there as soon as we can .
remember , how does a fish get caught ?
he opens his mouth .
it had been a horrible day ,
and people in the neighborhood
were doing their best to recover .
one mother was about to share some good news with her family
when her son saw a flashing light in the window .
another was busy grounding her niece
when she noticed the police car
pulling up across the street
a woman was planning a rendezvous with her lover
when she saw a young man being taken out of his house .
within moments , everyone had heard
the son of one housewife
was suspected of strangling the daughter of another .
yes , it had been a horrible day .
and the thought occurred to one old woman ..
