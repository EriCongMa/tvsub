i &apos;m dying of old age .
good @-@ bye .
you &apos;re katherine pierce .
suck it up .
i was 21051 .
you were an augustine vampire ?
i &apos;m sure augustine will be thrilled to have you back .
that &apos;s my dad .
grayson gilbert was one of the best doctors the augustines ever had .
elena . wake up .
what the hell is going on ?
i &apos;ve been here before .
believe it or not , i made a friend .
my name &apos;s enzo .
you have to tell me how you got out of here .
damon , now !
i &apos;m sorry , enzo .
damon , please .
i turned off my emotions .
i let my friend die .
welcome .
i &apos;m 12144 .
my name is enzo .
slick hands , cowboy .
come on !
oh , my god !
um , don &apos;t turn around .
what are you doing ?
um , just don &apos;t turn around .
where are you going ?
uh , everything &apos;s fine .
go back to bed .
what the hell happened to you ?
ditto .
elena &apos;s not here by any chance , is she ?
i haven &apos;t seen her ,
not that i &apos;ve been looking .
stef , you awake ?
you know , he hasn &apos;t seen her either .
i know because we were together
all night .
look . i &apos;ve had a really crappy couple days , ok ?
if you &apos;re implying what i think you &apos;re implying--
why ? what were you thinking ?
that our hot , naked bodies collided
in one unforgettable night of passion ?
i &apos;m gonna barf .
great . then my work here is done .
too @-@ do @-@ loo .
subject 83182 appears conscious .
where am i ?
why ? look familiar ?
what is that thing ?
what are you doing to me ?
83182 commences prep for blood dialysis .
count from 10 .
9 , 8 , 7,
6 , 5 ...
where the hell you been ?
aw , you know , being held against my will , shot in the head ,
now i can &apos;t find elena .
how was your evening ?
anything out of the ordinary happen ?
wait a minute . what do you mean you can &apos;t find elena ?
i mean , she &apos;s not picking up her phone ,
she &apos;s not in her dorm , she &apos;s nowhere in this house ,
which leads me to believe
that dr . creepy ken doll has her somewhere .
are you talking about the whitmore bio teacher ?
yeah , the one that operated on vampires
during business hours , yeah , that one .
put your hero hair on , stefan . let &apos;s go get elena .
you just said you don &apos;t know where she is .
i don &apos;t , which means we &apos;re gonna have to find us some leverage .
so come on .
pop quiz . so your girlfriend &apos;s taken by a mad scientist .
now do you : &quot; a , &quot; get a new girlfriend ;
&quot; b , &quot; call the police ;
or &quot; c , &quot; kill someone close to that mad scientist ?
sit .
4.1 pints drained .
83182 still shows signs of consciousness .
note that 15 years ago subject 12144
faded into unconsciousness after losing 2.9 pints .
evolution or luck ?
mystery for another day .
what are you doing to me ?
what are these tubes ?
let me go !
relax . i plan to once i &apos;m through with you .
my friends are gonna find me .
your heroic vampire friends ?
did you know aaron whitmore spent
his entire life thinking his family was haunted
by some death curse ?
turns out that curse was your boyfriend
systematically killing every member on his family tree .
i &apos;m curious . how does one justify that in her mind ?
and this , holding people against their will ,
torturing them ?
how do you justify that ?
science .
&quot; june 25 , 1999 . incredible findings today .
&quot; after enduring 3,000 volts of electricity ,
the subject continues to have a heartbeat .
&quot; june 26 . more success .
&quot; subject was exposed to 4,000 volts today .
&quot; seizing continues after electrocution .
flesh remains hot to the touch . &quot;
you &apos;re a monster .
this isn &apos;t my journal , elena .
these are the hand @-@ written medical findings of dr. grayson gilbert ,
your father .
what ?
everything i &apos;m doing to you
i learned from him .
i have no idea where wes took her .
well , they &apos;re not at his lab ,
so where else could he hide a vampire ?
i &apos;m sorry . am i supposed to know who you are ?
that &apos;s my brother stefan ,
but i &apos;d watch your tone with him
because he &apos;s kind of in the midst of a psychotic break .
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m what ?
oh , come on . you don &apos;t think i know about you and katherine ?
oh , i see . you &apos;re jealous .
more like disturbed .
see ? he &apos;s off his rocker ,
he &apos;s losing his mind ,
teetering on the brink of insanity .
how are you not dead ? i shot you .
well , because you went for the head .
you got to go for the heart .
go for the heart next time .
now where &apos;s elena ?
i have no idea .
all that wes told me was to go about my life as usual .
well , you &apos;re gonna call wes ,
and you &apos;re gonna tell him that if he doesn &apos;t give us elena
the next experiment that he conducts
is gonna be sewing your arms back on .
this is my dad &apos;s clinic .
we &apos;re in the basement .
was your dad &apos;s clinic .
then your town council burned a whole bunch of vampires down here .
now it &apos;s just a condemned building in mystic falls
where no one will find us .
aaron , hey .
do you have elena ?
aaron , what &apos;s wrong ?
uh , stefan and damon salvatore are gonna kill me
unless you give them elena .
damon salvatore is locked in an impenetrable
and inescapable fortified cell .
or he &apos;s in front of me imagining what my kidney would taste like .
fine . meet you in my classroom .
once i see you &apos;re safe ,
tell them i &apos;ll give them elena .
enzo ...
enzo , wake up .
when was the last time you were out in civilization ?
what &apos;s that ?
an insurance policy .
guarantees you &apos;ll come back to me .
i &apos;m giving you the day off .
you and damon have some catching up to do .
i don &apos;t hear you counting .
3 , 4 , 5 , 6 .
good try .
good try ? that was horrible , matt .
come on . i &apos;m paying you to make me hot again ,
whip me into shape ,
and prolong this death thing as long as possible .
yeah , that will happen .
what did you say ?
no . seriously . i didn &apos;t hear you .
oh , god . i &apos;m going deaf . i &apos;m going deaf .
my entire body is falling apart .
i can &apos;t breathe . i can &apos;t breathe .
wa--water ! give me some water . faster .
deep breaths .
if you &apos;re so anxious not to be dead ,
why don &apos;t you just have a vampire turn you ?
tried that .
every time i ingest vampire blood ,
my body rejects it .
who is that ? i can &apos;t see .
it &apos;s nadia . i told her you were here .
&quot; dear nadia , sorry i had to kill your boyfriend ,
but it was the motherly thing to do .
suicide , however , not very motherly of me . &quot;
great . so , um , stefan obviously gave you my suicide note .
what &apos;s your point ?
damn !
that &apos;s for trying to kill yourself without saying good @-@ bye .
you want to give me a little back story as to how you know one another ?
aaron is aaron whitmore ,
and he comes from a very long line of vampire @-@ probing , blood @-@ testing ,
organ @-@ removing freaks
called augustine .
why do you know this ?
because i was their test subject in the fifties .
what do you mean test subject ?
meaning i donated my body to science
except i was alive
and it was against my will .
wait . hold on a minute .
how do i not know about this ?
don &apos;t get all guilt @-@ ridden , stefan , on me .
we were on the outs back then ,
and by the time it was over , you know ,
it was over .
why don &apos;t you finish the rest of the story , damon ?
i don &apos;t recall saying that you could talk .
did i say that he could talk ?
i don &apos;t remember anything .
i didn &apos;t think so .
i get it now .
if i was living here ,
i &apos;d want to kill myself , too .
it was a moment of weakness .
i &apos;m over it .
in a moment of weakness , you eat chocolate or kiss the wrong boy .
you don &apos;t jump off a clock tower .
do you see this ? this is raw kale .
in what universe would i put this inside of my body
unless i actually wanted to live another day .
ok . then what changed your mind ?
it &apos;s not so much a matter of what
as it is who .
can i ask you something
absentee mother to mildly abusive daughter ?
i &apos;m listening .
do you think after all the horrible things that i &apos;ve done
it would be possible to be forgiven ?
of course i do .
that &apos;s actually why i &apos;m here .
i may have an idea that will keep you alive longer .
i &apos;m listening .
when did you meet my dad ?
he was working with augustine
to turn vampire blood into a magical cure @-@ all
to fight disease , cure cancer ,
save the world .
do you know if he ever brought a vampire down here ?
i remember coming down here as a kid .
there was something about this place that always creeped me out .
wes , i saw enzo when i woke up .
i know he &apos;s alive .
where is he ?
he &apos;s on a little day trip .
apparently he has some unresolved business with your boyfriend .
what did you do ?
what did you do ?
what did you do ?
which one is it ?
it &apos;s right here .
21051 .
enzo !
it &apos;s been a while , mate .
who the hell are you ?
lorenzo ...
but my friends call me enzo .
ah . kidding . i don &apos;t have any friends .
enzo &apos;s another augustine vampire .
our cells were next to each other .
so we &apos;re here to meet somebody-- wes maxfield .
you know him ?
that &apos;s your first question for me ?
not &quot; how are you ?
how &apos;d you survive in that fire i left you to die in &quot; ?
uh , does somebody want to tell me what the hell is going on here ?
i &apos;d love to . have a seat .
been waiting 70 years to tell my story .
enzo is the augustine vampire .
he killed my roommate megan , didn &apos;t he ?
conserve your energy .
i &apos;ve drained enough blood to start phase two .
let me guess .
you &apos;re not gonna tell me what phase two is , are you ?
if it works , you &apos;ll be the first one to know .
why did megan have a picture of my dad on her cell phone ?
maybe because her parents helped fund your father &apos;s projects .
they knew about augustine , too ?
well , no . all they knew was
that your dad had an unregulated compound
that could cure most injuries .
vampire blood .
exactly , but as megan grew up ,
she got suspicious , enrolled at whitmore ,
roomed with dr. gilbert &apos;s daughter ,
and she went to a party at whitmore house
and put her nose where it didn &apos;t belong .
she found enzo in his cell .
and being clueless to what a starving vampire
will do around fresh human blood ,
i &apos;m guessing she got too close .
aaron .
where &apos;s elena ?
who &apos;s this ?
we have aaron , and we &apos;re trying to decide how to kill him .
funny . i have elena ,
and i &apos;m wondering how she &apos;ll function without her cerebral cortex .
touch him , and you &apos;ll never see her again .
that threat works both ways .
damon and i had been locked in those cells for years ,
tortured , beaten , humiliated ,
but we weren &apos;t gonna let them break us , no .
we decided if we were going to escape we needed to work together .
we needed each other .
he &apos;s not sending her .
tragic . can i continue my story now , please ?
doesn &apos;t he know we have aaron ?
he doesn &apos;t care . he &apos;s willing to risk it .
what ? let me talk to him ! he &apos;ll listen to me .
what part of &quot; he doesn &apos;t care , or you are not registering . &quot;
where were we ?
ah , right .
i was telling my story ,
and you were all politely listening .
so i &apos;d given damon all of my blood ration
so he &apos;d have the strength to escape
and save me in the process .
our plan began perfectly , didn &apos;t it ?
i was waiting in the cage for him to release me ,
waiting for my friend , my cellmate ,
the only soul with whom i &apos;d connected with
in all those years of captivity .
then a fire starts , burns out of control ,
but damon just can &apos;t get the damn cage open .
he looks me in the eye
as if he doesn &apos;t even recognize me ,
turns around , saves himself ,
leaving me to die .
well , you didn &apos;t die obviously .
no . unfortunately i lived .
i was spared by one of the scientists
so i could spend another 50 years
on a table being opened and closed .
now that we &apos;ve all been acquainted ,
i &apos;m gonna go find something to wet my whistle .
you didn &apos;t tell me about him .
it was the 1950s .
i &apos;m supposed to remember every moment of my life ?
do you want to kill aaron , or should i ?
this guy was your cellmate for 5 years ,
you left him to die , he comes back ,
and you &apos;re completely unfazed ?
fine . i will .
whoa , whoa , whoa . hold on , hold on , hold on .
wes gave me a bunch of files on my family history .
they &apos;re in my dorm , ok ?
maybe there &apos;s something in there you need ,
a name , i mean , another lab .
that &apos;s a timely revelation .
yeah . well , you know , he &apos;s not gonna help me ,
so why should i help him ?
i don &apos;t like you , i don &apos;t like your family ,
i don &apos;t like you messing with my relationship .
if you &apos;re lying , i &apos;m gonna take my thumbs ,
and i &apos;m gonna gouge out your sad little eyes
out of your sad little head !
ah . it &apos;s frightening what you can find on campus these days .
knock yourself out . we &apos;re going with plan &quot; b. &quot;
damon &apos;s not .
damon &apos;s staying right here .
he knows all my secrets ,
so he knows how ornery i can get when i don &apos;t get my way .
call me if you find anything ,
kill him if you don &apos;t .
let &apos;s go .
you didn &apos;t just propose spirit possession with a straight face ?
you said my grandfather was a traveler ,
which means your father was a traveler .
therefore , you are a traveler .
we just need to find one who can teach you
how to do the passenger spell .
hang on . i &apos;m hardly a traveler , ok ?
my father banned us from doing traveler magic .
he said it was the devil &apos;s work
or something dramatic that terrified us ,
and then i became a vampire
and never thought about it again .
but it &apos;s in your blood ,
which means you have the ability
to keep living inside someone else &apos;s body .
gregor was a traveler .
he put his spirit inside matt
so that even after his body died he lived on .
yes ! he lived on in a busboy .
good idea , nadia .
let &apos;s put my essence in some nobody .
thing is , stefan actually likes this body .
what are you talking about ?
stefan and i may have rekindled an old flame last night .
i see .
so when you asked me about forgiveness ,
you were asking about him , not me ?
look . maybe i don &apos;t want to die
a sad , lonely 538 @-@ year @-@ old .
if i have to bow out ,
knowing that stefan still cares might not be the worst way to go .
no . you had it right the first time .
go kill yourself , see if anyone misses you .
what about cricket ?
that ever become a thing here ?
no .
oh , shame . fun sport .
not that i can play .
took up drawing for a while .
of course i had no pencil , so i &apos;d just prick my finger
and paint the cell wall with my blood .
what do you want ?
you want me to feel guilty ?
i couldn &apos;t save you .
now where &apos;s elena ?
what &apos;s wrong with you ?
wes injected me with poison
that will stop my heart .
i &apos;ll desiccate if i don &apos;t return for the antidote .
all the more reason to tell me where he is .
look . you get the antidote , i &apos;ll save my girlfriend ,
we &apos;ll kill wes together .
did you even think about it after you left ,
the experiments , the cell ,
or did you just go out and live your merry life to its fullest ?
look at me .
if you go back , we go back together .
we finish this for good .
come on .
you &apos;re not gonna see your girl again , damon ,
because i want the antidote ,
and wes told me not to come back
until you were dead .
i imagine you just broke your clavicle .
probably a few lumbar and thoracic vertebrae .
it &apos;s funny what you learn about your body
when it &apos;s taken apart like a bloody
automobile right before your eyes !
i &apos;m not gonna fight you , enzo .
what are you gonna do then , run ?
you &apos;re good at that .
i want to find my girlfriend .
while you were out running wild ,
i had one single thought ,
that i &apos;d have the pleasure of killing you .
enzo , look at me .
bloody poison !
where is she ? where &apos;s elena ?
tell me where she is !
or what ? !
you never see her again ?
it might be good for you to know what it &apos;s like
to miss someone for the next 60 years .
enzo , look at me . hey !
enzo ! where is she ? where is she ?
enzo , hey .
all the files of my family history are in here .
hurry up .
is this all a lie , huh ?
if you want me to kill you ,
i will kill you .
do not test me .
do it . i &apos;m dead already .
damon &apos;s been planning my death since before i was born .
what are you talking about ?
damon left out the best part of the augustine story ,
the part after he escaped .
talk .
it wasn &apos;t enough for damon to kill the doctors who tortured him .
he had to torture their families
and their future families .
he spent the last 60 years killing
every one of my relatives .
except he &apos;s a psychopath .
he leaves one alive so that they can continue the family line
so that he can destroy future generations of innocent people .
so go ahead and do it , kill me
because i don &apos;t want to give damon the satisfaction ,
so do it .
do it !
you know , not all of us are like my brother .
stefan ?
this is everything wes gave me on augustine .
i saw elena &apos;s last name on a few pages .
maybe it will help .
you &apos;re not supposed to be down here .
basement &apos;s a kid @-@ free zone , remember ?
i heard someone screaming .
oh , it &apos;s ok . everything &apos;s fine .
in fact , today &apos;s a good day , elena .
why ?
daddy &apos;s gonna save a little girl &apos;s life .
she &apos;s just about the same age as you .
pretty cool , huh ?
all right . get out of here .
doctor &apos;s orders .
ok , dad .
good news . the sample cells mutated .
my compound worked .
i don &apos;t follow .
you kicked me out of bio , remember ?
you &apos;ve heard of pavlov ?
conditioned his dog to salivate at the sound of a bell .
this compound is like that bell ,
except instead of a ding your body will salivate
at the smell of vampire blood .
oh , my god .
that &apos;s what you did to jesse .
you turned him into some rabid vampire ,
who only wanted to feed on other vampires .
jesse was a fantastic case study ,
but he took too long to condition .
and considering the size of the vampire population ,
a single @-@ dose injection is much more efficient .
yeah , but he couldn &apos;t stop feeding .
he tried to kill damon .
exactly . vampires are now one shot away
from craving their own kind .
and you &apos;re about to be patient zero .
what ? no .
no , you can &apos;t do that to me .
you &apos;ll turn me into a ripper .
i know .
subject 83182 prepped for compound injection .
no . please . you can &apos;t do this to me .
you &apos;ll be doing the world a favor , elena .
i might not be able to kill vampires ...
no ! let me go !
but you will .
no .
elena !
stefan !
it &apos;s out of here .
oh , god . ohh .
i &apos;m here . stefan .
come here .
oh . you &apos;re ok . i got you .
i got you . i got you . i got you .
get me out of here .
come on .
wait , wait ...
look . we &apos;re closing , so ...
we met on a little patio like this , remember ?
the twinkling lights , music .
that was a fun night .
yeah . i &apos;d kind of rather just put us , um , behind us .
fine . will do .
but i need you to hold on to this for me .
the travelers &apos; knife ?
no way . i just got rid of that thing .
it &apos;s not about you .
i &apos;m leaving mystic falls ,
and i need to know it &apos;s safe .
why , and why do people want it ?
i thought i could convince katherine to live a little longer .
i was wrong .
but if she changes her mind ,
she will need this .
that &apos;s all you need to know .
well , she won &apos;t .
because katherine cares about katherine .
and only katherine .
if she doesn &apos;t want to do something , then she won &apos;t .
i spent 500 years searching for her .
i finally find her only to lose her all over again .
i don &apos;t know if i should hate her for giving up
or be at her side when she dies .
listen .
i get the whole crappy parenting tihing .
my mom kind of sucked .
she was selfish , and she drank too much
and never really thought about how it would affect me .
then you know what it &apos;s like to hold on to the hope
that maybe just once
she &apos;ll do what you want .
if she changes her mind ,
the knife will be with me .
oh . never mind .
what did you do now ?
well , i injected you with a bunch of these
that say , &quot; antidote . &quot;
and apparently , one of them worked .
if this is some attempt to make amends , it &apos;s a bit pathetic , mate .
i don &apos;t care about amends , mate .
my girlfriend &apos;s safe , so technically , i &apos;m not suffering ,
and it &apos;d really suck if you desiccated in vain ...
and i &apos;m gonna tell you my side of the story .
you asked me if i thought about you after i escaped ,
and answer is no .
and i sure as hell don &apos;t feel guilty about leaving you
because in order for me to save myself and leave you ,
i had to shut off my humanity , damn it ,
so i flipped the switch ,
and then i felt nothing ,
no remorse , no regret , no pain .
and now what do you feel ,
remorse , regret , pain ?
even if i forgave you , damon .
would that make you less of a horrible person ?
damn it !
we &apos;re even , enzo .
you were the most important person in my life ,
and you ruined me ,
but that &apos;s just who you are ,
that &apos;s who you &apos;ll always be ...
a monster .
it &apos;s weird . even as a kid ,
there was something about that basement that creeped me out .
sure you want to give yourself nightmares reading that thing ?
and i remember my dad talking about this little girl .
i think he was talking about my roommate megan .
look . &quot; january 1999 . saw megan king today .
&quot; megan is 7 years old .
&quot; she suffers from a congenital heart defect
&quot; with a life expectancy of two months .
&quot; a single injection of vampire blood
appears to be an effective life @-@ saving solution . &quot;
that &apos;s why megan had a picture of my dad on her phone--
because he saved her life .
a hundred pages of horrific torture ,
and you find the one happy passage .
my dad used his research to save people , damon ,
children , families .
yeah . and dissected vampires along the way .
news flash , elena . you are a vampire .
i mean , do you honestly think that he would
sit here and see you as anything more ?
i don &apos;t know .
he was my dad . i can &apos;t not defend him .
no . i know you can &apos;t
because you do it for me all the time .
i &apos;m not defending you .
i &apos;m not defending your decision to kill aaron &apos;s entire family ,
to go out of town and kill the aunt while we were still together .
so why are you still here ?
i &apos;m bad , elena , i am bad for you ,
so why wouldn &apos;t you have run away from me as far as humanly possible ?
because i love you , damon , because i chose you ,
and because i stand by my choice .
well , now i &apos;m choosing ,
and i &apos;m choosing to let you go .
what ?
no , damon .
i am choosing to not have to think
about how you must feel every time some ghost
from my past comes into our life .
i &apos;m choosing to relieve you
of having to defend me for every awful thing i &apos;ve ever done .
stop acting like i &apos;m perfect .
damon , i &apos;ve done horrible things , too .
you think i &apos;m gonna stand here and judge you
after i find out that you &apos;ve been tortured for 5 years ?
stop defending me !
i won &apos;t change who i am .
i can &apos;t ...
but i refuse to change you .
can i come in , or are you gonna freak out and run away again ?
i &apos;m getting wrinkles .
katherine pierce &apos;s chickens come home to roost
in the form of wrinkles .
it &apos;s kind of brilliant .
what &apos;s the opposite of funny ?
oh , right . not funny .
hmm . so what are you , uh , doing in my room ?
i want to talk about last night .
ok .
so talk .
well , um , it was a long day ,
we had a moment , and we got swept up in it .
did you memorize that from ...
a textbook or something ?
katherine , what do you expect ?
you want me just forget everything
that you &apos;ve put me through for the last 147 years ?
i &apos;m dying , stefan .
i know you are , and i &apos;m sure that
you will figure a way out of it .
no . i mean , it &apos;s for real this time .
look at me . i &apos;m dying .
what does someone have to go through
to get a little redemption around here ?
147 years is a long time to forgive
in one night .
one night ...
an eternity ...
you &apos;d never look at me the way you look at elena , would you ?
good night , stefan .
i &apos;m sorry that you &apos;re dying .
trust me .
i am , too .
wes ? wes ?
aaron ?
what the hell is this place , huh ?
it &apos;s one of augustine &apos;s research labs .
do you really think that you &apos;re helping people with this vampire crap ?
you sold me out !
you used my life as a bargaining chip .
aaron , i &apos;m sorry .
i never want to see you again .
get the hell out of my life .
aaron .
aaron !
so do we have a deal ?
you &apos;ll find me a traveler that will teach me how to do do the spell ?
i guess this means you want to live .
i &apos;m a survivor .
staying alive is my specialty .
mm @-@ hmm . assuming of course it &apos;s on your terms .
clearly stefan inspired some profound thinking .
i think stefan believes that a part of me can still be redeemed .
and what do you think ?
is he right ?
hello ?
katherine ?
