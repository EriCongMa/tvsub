maura , sweetheart .
good morning , angela .
how you doing ?
oh , i don &apos;t know .
i don &apos;t know .
go ahead , maura . let it out .
i &apos;ll get us some coffee .
a tragic accident like that ...
you never really see it coming .
i am worried about jane .
her and barry were so close , and ...
well , with the pregnancy and all those hormones --
jane doesn &apos;t know that you know
and she hasn &apos;t told anyone else , so you need to just --
i know . keep my trap shut . i will .
doesn &apos;t mean that a mother can &apos;t worry .
she &apos;s always been so good about sympathizing with others .
but when it comes to her own feelings ,
she bottles everything up .
she needs to let it out .
so do you .
you need a good cry , a big cry .
we will . in time .
dabda .
gesundheit ?
the stages of grief .
denial , anger , bargaining ,
depression , acceptance .
it &apos;s from elisabeth kubler @-@ ross &apos; seminal work
in the mid @-@ 20th century .
though current research shows that yearning
is actually a more accurate expression of the final --
okay . that all sounds great .
when &apos;s the crying start ?
hey . good morning , ma .
hi , honey .
thanks for letting me stay over last night .
no problem . i didn &apos;t want to be alone , either .
where you going ?
to the station .
don &apos;t you think it would be better
to stay home and feel your feelings ?
ma , he loved his work .
he wouldn &apos;t want me to just curl up and stop doing mine .
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s what your mom &apos;s suggesting .
maybe -- maybe you can sit down , have a cup of coffee ?
real coffee .
i can make us all some breakfast .
i &apos;ll take the coffee .
thanks .
see you later .
wasn &apos;t that your vase ?
yep .
denial .
check .
good morning .
what are you doing here ?
i have dealt with hundreds of homicides
and the grieving relatives that go with them .
i can deal with this .
really ?
because you had coffee in your pencil holder .
it &apos;s not a pencil holder . maura was messing with me .
go home .
no .
maybe i wasn &apos;t clear . i &apos;m ordering you to go home .
you &apos;re ordering me ?
yes .
we don &apos;t have a case we &apos;re working on .
i &apos;m the sergeant detective of this squad .
and i have the authority to send you home if i think you &apos;re not --
if you think that i am gonna let you pull rank on me ,
it &apos;s not -- - jane ?
mrs. frost .
i &apos;m sorry to interrupt .
i ... i just didn &apos;t know where else to go .
i &apos;m so sorry .
and then the funeral director
started asking me all these questions
like did i want a viewing ,
should barry wear his uniform ,
what kind of music should they play .
and i realized ... i don &apos;t know .
how could you ?
a couple of years ago , barry sat me down
and had me tell him what i wanted at my service .
it never dawned on me to ask about his .
he was just so young .
would you like us to take care of the service for you ?
i couldn &apos;t ask you to do that .
you didn &apos;t ask . i volunteered .
even his father can &apos;t get here .
h @-@ he &apos;s on a ship doing a support mission
in the middle of the pacific .
so ... it would mean so much if you could help .
we &apos;d be honored .
and of course we &apos;ll , uh , keep you in the loop
on all the preparations .
nobody knew my son better than you all did ,
so whatever you decide , i know it will be perfect .
just what barry would have wanted .
well , now you got a reason to go home .
vince , come on .
please don &apos;t pull rank on me now , okay ?
i know your heart is in the right ...
gun !
put your weapon down .
put it down .
help me .
we &apos;ll help you as soon as you give us that gun .
what &apos;s your name ?
i @-@ i don &apos;t know .
okay . what kind of help do you need ?
i killed someone .
who ?
i don &apos;t know that , either .
well , i guess we got a case now .
how did you get here ?
i , um ... i walked by
the deli , dry cleaner ,
and then i saw a policeman walk in here ,
so i @-@ i followed him .
how about before that ?
i @-@ i don &apos;t know .
what city are we in ?
boston .
what &apos;s your favorite baseball team ?
red sox .
you said you killed someone .
did that happen in the day or the night ?
i @-@ i don &apos;t -- i don &apos;t know .
we just need it high enough
so i can remove her clothes in private .
that was very considerate .
i &apos;d hate to have to testify on why we undressed her
in front of the entire boston police force .
doctor ?
uh , after we &apos;ve collected the clothing ,
take the tarp to evidence and make sure
we process everything that fell off .
amanda &apos;s gonna remove your clothes and your shoes .
and we have scrubs and shoes for you to put on .
if you &apos;re cold , i can give you a reflective blanket .
o @-@ okay .
i &apos;m not going home .
planning a funeral takes a lot of time .
she might have committed a murder or not .
he would have wanted me to stay on the job
and figure out what happened .
have you noticed that you won &apos;t say his name ?
barry frost .
there . you happy , dr. freud ?
well , freud actually believed that
everything was related to some repressed sexual desire .
i do not think that is the reason
that you will not say detective frost &apos;s name .
i have to figure out who she is . i will talk to you later .
probably shouldn &apos;t have said that .
all his years on the force ,
he &apos;s entitled to the pomp and circumstance ,
even if he didn &apos;t die in the line of duty .
hey . i heard about frost .
it &apos;s a real shame . he was a good man .
yeah . he was .
thanks .
look , i know everybody means well ,
but that &apos;s gonna be real tough to do 200 times today .
and , yes , of course he deserves it .
frost deserves a cop &apos;s funeral .
but if we go full pageant , then it becomes a photo op .
if it becomes a photo op , then everyone shows up --
the cardinal , the mayor .
frost hated the mayor .
he wrote in bill &quot; spaceman &quot; lee
instead of voting for him .
exactly .
let &apos;s keep what frost liked and ditch what he hated .
so no to the mayor and ...
yes to bagpipes .
how did he feel about &quot; danny boy &quot; ?
yes to bagpipes , no to &quot; danny boy . &quot;
you be in charge of the music .
i don &apos;t know anything about music .
you want to do the eulogy ?
you &apos;re good with music .
hey , i volunteered for pictures .
oh , i &apos;m no good at pictures , either .
well , why don &apos;t you just let me know
when you decide what you &apos;re least bad at ?
hey , jane .
your woman &apos;s fingerprints are a bust .
she wasn &apos;t in the database .
but her gun was recently fired .
any dead bodies lying in the street
that are in need of a suspect to go with them ?
wouldn &apos;t that be convenient ?
well , missing @-@ persons &apos; reports matching her description ?
no .
uninvestigated gunshots
anywhere in the greater boston area ?
oh , come on .
we all know she &apos;s faking amnesia to set up
a mental @-@ incapacitation defense for a murder trial .
probably .
but she was covered in blood and had no visible injuries .
i mean , based on volume alone , someone is dead
or going to be soon if we don &apos;t find them .
no shots . at least not that shot alert picked up .
okay . let &apos;s get her picture to all roll calls ,
see if we can track her in the homeland security cameras .
you all know roger wise ,
the department grief counselor .
i was very sorry to hear about detective frost .
i &apos;m here to help any way i can .
so , i can &apos;t force any of you to talk to roger
about this tragic auto accident .
but i can force you to sit with him for 30 minutes ,
talk about anything you like .
so , who &apos;s first ?
i @-@ i got to distribute the photo .
i got to check out the cameras .
i &apos;ll , uh ...
thanks for volunteering , detective .
takes a strong man to open up about his feelings .
dr. maura isles initiating the examination of ...
i @-@ i don &apos;t want to call you &quot; jane doe &quot;
because that &apos;s what i call the other women
who end up on this table who are ...
less alive than you .
so , based on the flounce hem of your skirt
and the elasticity of your skin ,
i &apos;d say you &apos;re in your mid @-@ 20s .
the most popular baby name 25 years ago was jessica .
okay .
maura isles initiating the examination
of jessica doe , female caucasian .
approximate age is 25 .
i &apos;m sorry to be talking as if you weren &apos;t here .
it &apos;s okay .
you &apos;re trying to help me , right ?
well , i &apos;m ...
i &apos;m trying to find out what happened to you .
i &apos;m going to take scrapings to see if there &apos;s
any tissues underneath your fingernails .
so , you like the red sox ?
do you have a favorite player ?
dustin pedroia .
most defensive runs saved at his position over the last three years .
he &apos;s got a nice smile .
yes , he does .
when i was at bcu ,
my roommate took me to a game ,
and it was the best hot dog i ever had .
it &apos;s the mustard .
i didn &apos;t know that .
been to a game recently ?
i don &apos;t know .
it &apos;s okay .
i am going to floss your teeth .
if you could just open your mouth for me , please .
i wonder what &apos;s in that mustard .
camera tracks her down tremont to columbus .
then she heads onto the bike path , southwest corridor ,
and that &apos;s it &apos; cause the cameras stop .
okay . well , i got a hit on the gun registration .
the owner reported it stolen three years ago
and doesn &apos;t know our woman .
i finished my live autopsy .
well , technically it can &apos;t be an autopsy because that is ,
by definition , an examination of a body after death .
although i could be using the word in the spirit of autopsia ,
from the greek , meaning &quot; to see with one &apos;s own eyes . &quot;
anyway . jessica ...
who &apos;s jessica ?
the woman from the lobby .
no , korsak . maura &apos;s named her .
now we &apos;ll never be able to give her back .
the blood on her clothes was from a single subject ,
likely male , type a @-@ negative .
okay . probably caucasian .
in boston , yes .
and in honolulu ?
well , over a 60 % chance that the subject would be polynesian .
do you make this stuff up &apos; cause you know we can &apos;t check it ?
yes .
no . i &apos;m not that fanciful .
jessica also had traces of methylenedioxy on her skirt .
perfect ,
that narrows our search down to 2,000 ecstasy dealers
and about a bajillion ecstasy users .
i also have a possible explanation for her amnesia .
she might be in a dissociative fugue state .
is that greek for &quot; faking it ? &quot;
&apos;cause that &apos;s what we think right now .
a fugue state is a very rare condition that occurs
when someone experiences a trauma so severe
that they block parts of their consciousness related to it .
a bad thing happens and they forget
anything that might remind them of the bad thing .
yes .
jessica doesn &apos;t remember who she is
because it &apos;s directly connected to the traumatic event .
but she remembers that she likes the red sox
because it &apos;s not .
there &apos;s my vase .
okay , assuming
we thought this was real ... which we do not ...
how do we get her to snap out of it ?
i would suggest taking her to familiar places
and seeing if anything triggers any memories .
great plan , but because of her probably fake amnesia ,
we don &apos;t know anything about her .
well , she did have a firstpark ticket in her pocket
and candy @-@ coated fennel seed in her teeth .
those are digestives often found in indian restaurants .
so firstpark garages near indian restaurants .
does the phrase &quot; wild goose chase &quot; mean anything to you ?
yes , but ...
at least we get to try delicious digestives
all over the city .
bye , maura . bye , jane .
all right . how about that ? it &apos;s called taste of tandoor .
no .
how many stops do we have left ?
two . the next restaurant is on emerson .
firstpark garage is around the corner .
oh . what do we do when those turn up nothing ?
call dispatch , have them put her picture up on the website .
nothing ? none of this looks familiar to you ?
no .
i &apos;m sorry .
y @-@ you had to
have been to at least one of these places .
i mean , what about abe &amp; louie &apos;s ?
everybody in boston &apos;s eaten there .
no . over there . across the street .
wait . korsak , stop .
stop ! stop the car !
oh , my gosh ! look out for that car !
what ? ! are you crazy ? !
thanks .
i feel so stupid .
no need .
it just seemed so real .
i mean , i could have sworn he was standing right there .
at the beginning of my career ,
i was first on the scene at an auto accident .
older guy ran into a telephone pole .
the m.e. at the time thought he might have
had a heart attack and died at the wheel .
and the man had a smile on his face
like he died without a care in the world .
for months after that ,
i saw the guy all over boston --
sitting on a park bench , once at fenway park .
did that really happen
or are you just telling me that to make me feel better ?
i swear to god . the mind does funny things .
do you think frost made us stop ?
uh , i don &apos;t believe in that stuff . do you ?
no , but i think if i were dead
and you were here with frost ,
he might have believed it .
i mean , if she &apos;s running a con ,
does she actually think she &apos;s gonna get away with it ?
i &apos;ve said it before .
criminals are generally very , very stupid .
okay , listen .
i want to believe that what you &apos;re saying is real --
that you don &apos;t remember who you are , all right ?
and most days , i wouldn &apos;t be able to do that .
but today i &apos;m gonna try , okay ?
but if you don &apos;t remember something ...
... i can &apos;t help you .
whoa . whoa , whoa . what ? d @-@ do you have children ?
i @-@ i don &apos;t think so .
okay . uh , does it have something to do with kids ?
are you a teacher ?
yes !
okay . okay .
maybe he &apos;s helping us solve this after all .
any luck ?
it would help if teachers in massachusetts
had fingerprints on file . i &apos;ll hop in my time machine
and go back and let the union know your preference .
w @-@ without a name , i &apos;m having to call up individual schools .
and i &apos;m making a list of absent teachers .
and i &apos;m pulling up footage from schools nearby
to see if she wandered out of one of them .
it &apos;s gonna take a while to finish it all .
i get it . fingerprints on file would be a lot easier .
where &apos;s jane ?
it was a long day . i sent her home .
and she listened ?
i suppose it &apos;s possible she &apos;s sitting downstairs in the lobby .
how &apos;s it coming with the music for the funeral ?
oh , i &apos;ve eliminated many , many choices .
so nowhere .
basically .
lunch sucked today .
what did you do ?
i sat at my desk and ...
wondered where frost would have wanted to go .
what did you decide ?
i -- i wasn &apos;t hungry .
oh , hell .
i &apos;m headed home .
well , you &apos;re welcome to spend the night again if you &apos;d like .
no , thanks . i &apos;d rather be alone .
no offense .
none taken . how are you holding up ?
i &apos;m tired .
well , the development of the placenta
is one of the most energetically intense parts
of the first trimester -- that could be the reason .
or it could be that one of my best friends just died .
yes . that could be it , too .
i saw him on the street today .
i &apos;m sorry .
i mean , i didn &apos;t .
i thought i saw him on the street today .
that &apos;s called an anomalous experience .
it &apos;s -- it &apos;s perfectly normal .
as is crying .
how do you know i haven &apos;t cried yet ?
because you would have said , &quot; i had a good cry
and it didn &apos;t help , &quot; or something like that .
how are you doing ?
i think i &apos;ve moved through denial and anger .
i &apos;m ready to move into bargaining
and i &apos;ll have a good cry when i get to depression .
can &apos;t plan a cry , maura .
i &apos;m not planning it .
i &apos;m just narrowing down the window of its arrival .
and it occurred to me today that --
that we need to talk about our last wishes .
no , we don &apos;t .
i want to be buried at sea .
no . i hate boats .
and i &apos;d have to go to city hall
and get all kinds of permits .
uh , no . just pick something more landlocked .
jane , i want to return
to the primordial soup that spawned us all .
but nothing fancy --
a small group of friends and family , a cello .
we &apos;re on a boat , maura .
and a cello is officially fancy .
well , there would only be one .
and it should play bach &apos;s suite in &quot; g &quot; major .
and then everyone can toast me with a nice bottle of champagne
before you throw me overboard .
so , what do you want ?
i want to die one day before you
so i don &apos;t have to go out on a boat .
i &apos;ll see you tomorrow .
hey , ma . what are you doing here ?
making dinner .
i really appreciate it ,
but , uh , i &apos;m not that hungry .
then you &apos;ll eat just a little bit .
i just want to go to bed , ma .
you got to eat , jane . even if you &apos;re sad .
come on .
why are you still here ?
for jane .
yeah , i figured the more progress we make ,
the less she &apos;ll have to worry about the case .
what about you ?
same thing .
come on ! please ?
okay , well , t @-@ the next time you ask me for a favor ...
i &apos;ll ... probably help you out because i &apos;m a decent guy .
but i will not be nice about it !
what &apos;s going on ?
well , we didn &apos;t get anywhere with the local teachers &apos; unions .
and then it dawns on me .
maybe our woman doesn &apos;t work in the public school .
so i called a bunch of private schools near indian restaurants .
you know who she is ?
lily greene .
uh , she teaches at red tree preschool .
only i can &apos;t find a judge to sign a search warrant .
i walked in at the right moment .
that just happens to be my specialty .
good night .
have a good shift , todd .
oh , you have a nice evening , too .
uh , dr. isles ?
i @-@ i heard about detective frost .
i &apos;m sorry . i know the two of you were close .
thank you , todd .
he was a nice guy -- a @-@ a really nice guy .
yes . he was .
good morning .
shh !
what ?
oh . what is she doing here ?
watching me .
before we go to the station ,
can we stop and get some breakfast ?
we &apos;re not going to the station .
we &apos;re going to lily greene &apos;s apartment .
oh . i &apos;m so hungry . who &apos;s lily greene ?
you know , miss &quot; i have blood all over me and i don &apos;t know who i am . &quot;
so you found out who she is . that &apos;s great .
what did she say when you told her ?
well , we haven &apos;t told her yet .
i mean , we &apos;ve got one shot at a confession .
so if we open the door to her apartment
and there &apos;s a dead body in there ,
it kind of makes it a little difficult
for her to keep faking amnesia --
if that &apos;s what she &apos;s doing .
okay , so crime scene , then breakfast .
why didn &apos;t you eat a muffin before you left the house ?
there &apos;s no nutrition in a muffin .
there &apos;s no nutrition in gum .
well , i like juicy fruit .
clear .
clear .
can i come in now ?
yeah .
just seems that we &apos;re one body short of an actual crime scene .
well , there &apos;s been a crime .
just not one requiring an autopsy .
it &apos;s a very thorough search .
yeah , which begs the question , what were they looking for ?
found some money wrappers . about $ 2,000 worth .
i can fast @-@ track them for drug residue .
looks like there &apos;s a mr. lily greene .
i pulled up her cellphone records
as soon as we got the warrant .
she made a lot of calls to a guy named toby warren .
okay . let &apos;s get a warrant out for him , too .
thanks .
barista gave me the usual .
i didn &apos;t have the heart to give it back .
what are you doing ?
the part of the job that frost would normally do
and a lot slower than he would normally do it .
so far , lily greene seems like a stand @-@ up citizen .
there &apos;s not even a parking ticket .
and all i got on toby warren is that he &apos;s been
collecting unemployment for the past 18 months .
maybe she got tired of supporting him .
he trashed the apartment
looking for extra money to soften his landing .
she tracked him down , ended the relationship .
i feel sorry for kiki if this is how
you think you should end a relationship .
i &apos;m not dating kiki . she &apos;s my life coach .
how about i take over ... that
and you go get some fresh air ?
i can keep hitting the button .
that &apos;s probably a good idea .
my condolences .
how are you doing ?
if i get up at the funeral and just say nothing ,
will you nod your head
like i &apos;m doing something deep and meaningful ?
i absolutely will .
did you find anything at toby warren &apos;s apartment ?
not toby warren , if that &apos;s what you mean .
you have a &quot; but &quot; to go along with that unhelpful information ?
his cellphone &apos;s been pinging off the same tower for 24 hours .
i had his service provider turn on his gps .
is that your way of telling me to get off my ass ?
come on .
we got one bullet embedded in the wood here .
hey , frankie . our gun may have been discharged twice .
let &apos;s see if we can find that other bullet .
will do .
thanks .
based on this wound and that bullet ,
he was kneeling when he died .
it &apos;s an execution .
so , the bullet entered in his parietal bone
right above the lambdoid suture
and it exited through the right common carotid artery .
in order for her to be covered in arterial spray
on that part of her clothes ...
she &apos;d had to have been kneeling
right next to him when he was shot .
that &apos;s certainly something i &apos;d want to forget .
but to create that angle and this entry wound ,
the bullet fired at at least
15 degrees from perpendicular
and at a distance of greater than 18 inches .
mm @-@ hmm , so that means she would have to shoot across his body .
that can &apos;t be done .
no . not unless her arms are four feet long .
so , either she &apos;s elastic girl
or lily greene didn &apos;t kill toby warren .
well , i &apos;m gonna go out on a limb
and eliminate your elastigirl theory .
hey , doc ? i got a round blood drop on the floor here .
and no way that &apos;s splatter from toby warren , right ?
that definitely didn &apos;t come from toby &apos;s wounds .
i don &apos;t know where the second bullet is ,
but it looks like it hit someone .
well , what if the tissue that you found under lily &apos;s fingernails
were from her fighting the killer ?
it could be that &apos;s how she ended up with the gun .
jane , this one &apos;s smeared .
looks like they stepped in it .
judging from the stride , looks like they were running .
okay . so ... someone shoots toby .
lily ends up with the gun , shoots that person ,
and he or she runs away .
those are the facts as we currently know them .
just because lily didn &apos;t shoot toby
doesn &apos;t mean she wasn &apos;t involved in whatever got him shot .
is that your gut ?
no .
no , my gut says that whoever ran away
is our killer and that lily greene is
a completely innocent schoolteacher
who just had the worst night of her life .
would you like a cup of coffee ?
it won &apos;t taste very good , but it &apos;ll be warm .
no , thank you . did you find out who i am ?
we did . your name is lily greene .
um , you &apos;re a preschool teacher .
does any of that sound familiar ?
not really .
okay .
we think we have an idea of what happened to you .
you do ?
lily ...
do you recognize this man ?
no , i s @-@ swear i &apos;ll make this right .
if you just give me a chance . i promise .
i &apos;ll do anything . it won &apos;t happen again .
i didn &apos;t think -- i mean , i didn &apos;t know .
no . no , no , no . no .
okay . i @-@ i know this is hard .
i don &apos;t want to talk anymore .
lily ... you &apos;re safe .
whatever happened , you &apos;re safe now .
and pretending that it didn &apos;t happen --
it &apos;s not gonna change anything .
please !
don &apos;t . i swear i &apos;ll fix this .
i can . if you just give me a chance , i promise .
toby .
i &apos;m so sorry , sweetie . he &apos;s dead .
tell me what you remember .
no , he was a good man .
i think he just lost his way , you know ?
i do .
i do . what happened ?
a couple nights ago , toby told me
that in college he used to sell drugs
and that he started again when he lost his job .
he needed to pay his bills so he took some money .
and the man he was dealing for found out ,
said he had to give it back .
toby told me he was in trouble .
i lent him everything i had .
it wasn &apos;t all he owed , but we thought ,
you know , if we just showed good faith ...
but ... it didn &apos;t matter .
we &apos;ll make him pay for this , lily . just help me find him .
his name is kyle .
that &apos;s all i know .
that &apos;s enough .
we &apos;ll find him . i promise .
hi .
did you pick out music for the funeral yet ?
i got it narrowed down to about 20 choices .
which is only slightly better than no choices .
where are you with the pictures ?
done .
did you know that he had a wall full of albums ?
guy loved music . makes sense he &apos;d have a lot of cds .
not cds .
vinyl .
it was on the turntable .
it &apos;s probably the last thing he listened to
before he left on vacation .
thought it might help you out .
detective frost had good taste .
and just like that ,
i &apos;ve narrowed my choices down to one .
thanks , frankie .
frankie , you sure this is a solid lead ?
everybody going in and out of this place
looks more moonshine than ecstasy .
the drugs guys don &apos;t know kyle , but they &apos;ve heard his name
and they say this is where
most of the ecstasy in boston passes through .
why haven &apos;t they moved on it yet ?
oh , the usual reason .
waiting for bigger fish to swim by .
are you searching through my car ?
no .
was he this annoying as a kid ?
so much more so .
i can hear you !
are you ready ?
you mean the funeral ?
my mom took the food because she said
she knew what frost would want .
maura took the flowers &apos; cause she said
none of us knew anything about flowers .
you say you &apos;re good with the music .
his mom got the minister . i --
i got nothing .
every time i think about the eulogy , i just ...
all i picture is frost laughing at me .
it -- it --
it really messes with my concentration , you know ?
it ... maybe you just need to have a good cry , loosen yourself up .
i really wish that all of you --
is that him ?
yep .
frankie , that &apos;s our guy .
so we can &apos;t take him out until we &apos;re away from here .
yeah , we know . and you make sure you put
korsak &apos;s candy back in its hiding place .
i didn &apos;t find any candy .
i don &apos;t have candy .
let me see your hands !
damn .
stop !
freeze !
look at that .
i bet that matches the skin we found
under lily greene &apos;s fingernails .
congratulations , kyle .
you &apos;re under arrest for the murder of toby warren .
the front desk said that
your father was down here waiting for you .
dad .
wait . detective rizzoli .
thank you .
you &apos;re welcome .
you know , if you hadn &apos;t worked so hard ,
i would have never remembered .
i &apos;m very sorry for your loss .
i &apos;m very sorry for yours .
we shouldn &apos;t be here today .
barry frost was too young
and too good for us to be here today .
but yet , here we are .
i &apos;ve been given the incredible honor
of talking about how much we all loved barry .
and i could say &quot; a lot &quot; and go sit down ,
but it wouldn &apos;t do him justice .
barry was ...
... so many things to so many people .
... a son ...
... a cop ...
... a friend .
i met barry when he joined homicide .
and he was so nervous because
parts of the job didn &apos;t really agree with him ,
but he didn &apos;t let that stand in his way .
he just wanted to be the best cop that he could be .
he wanted to work harder , be smarter ,
try new things , and push himself .
and i admired
the passion that he brought to his work .
i will miss him as my partner .
and i will -- and i will miss him as my friend .
but as i was preparing this eulogy ,
i realized that i didn &apos;t want to
just think about what we &apos;ve lost .
i wanted to find something that we could hold on to .
so i started thinking about barry
and -- and what i really loved about him .
and -- and one idea kept coming to mind .
i really loved how he made me laugh .
and i will miss that infectious smile
and the joy that he brought to every day .
so , in this moment when it feels like there is none ,
here is the good news .
death may have taken barry ,
but it can &apos;t take our memories of him .
those wonderful and perfect
and beautiful memories .
those , thank god , are ours to keep .
maura , i &apos;m gonna be okay .
yes .
no , no . i &apos;m -- really , i &apos;m going right to bed .
i know that you would come over and stay with me , yes .
you know you &apos;re a good friend , right ?
okay . i &apos;ll see you tomorrow .
