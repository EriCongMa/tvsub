the press has named him the prince of darkness .
the dark is his signature
and we &apos;ll find that he &apos;s always killed this way .
he shows up during a blackout
he robs he kills he leaves a witness .
he got away with it for 26 years . why did he come back ?
joe and sylvia spicer were killed .
those are my parents .
why is he doing this ?
he keeps a survivor so they &apos;ll never forget him
but with you it goes beyond that .
he believes he turned you into the city &apos;s hero .
and he wants that recognition .
he wants everyone to know what he &apos;s done .
is that your daughter ? where is she ?
she &apos;s with my sister .
that &apos;s morgan on the other line .
we &apos;re gonna need him at kristin &apos;s house .
let &apos;s get over there .
this is about you .
there &apos;s no history at your sister &apos;s place .
he probably took them to santa monica
to your old house .
it &apos;s only a matter of time before the cell phone reception goes .
we lost morgan .
reid ? great .
put the gun down or she dies .
no pick it up ! pick it up !
on your knees .
don &apos;t do it ! spicer don &apos;t do this ! don &apos;t !
no !
what is wrong with you ? !
no !
we will find you you sick son of a bitch .
is that another promise ?
please please ... aah !
ellie i will find you !
this is what you &apos;re all afraid of .
the power grid is overloaded and gone completely down
plunging los angeles county into near @-@ total darkness .
city officials are unable or unwilling
to speculate on when the lights might be back on .
between the blackout and the prince of darkness
running around out there they advise locking doors tight
and staying very alert .
as one official said off the record
it &apos;s going to be a long long night .
help me ! help me !
he &apos;s coming !
please let me in . let me in .
let me in !
stop !
she &apos;s a child .
let me in !
ok i &apos;ll call-- look i &apos;ll call the police .
there &apos;s no time !
do not let her in the house .
spicer &apos;s sister &apos;s not in her apartment .
the building manager said she left hours ago .
morgan and spicer ?
no one &apos;s been in or out since the power went down .
morgan said they were coming here right ?
and he was a lot closer than any of us .
something must have changed .
the cells are down .
now how the hell do you find them ?
what would cause morgan to change his mind like that
when he knows he can &apos;t tell us ?
the unsub had spicer &apos;s sister and daughter .
morgan knew he didn &apos;t have a lot of time .
so his first guess had to be right .
the unsub attacked spicer
specifically through his family .
how long has spicer &apos;s sister lived here ?
6 @-@ 7 months .
well that &apos;s why they didn &apos;t come here .
if the unsub wants to hurt spicer
he &apos;ll do it someplace that means something to him .
morgan must have realized the same thing .
the unsub and spicer do share one place in common .
santa monica .
where he killed his parents .
let &apos;s go .
this is kurzbard in major crimes .
i need a priority response .
kristin .
kristin . kristin .
kristin .
it &apos;s getting harder to breathe .
just try to slow your breathing . just slow everything down .
we have to get her back .
she &apos;s just a baby .
look at me .
kristin look at me .
i need you to tell me everything
that you remember about the guy who took ellie .
i don &apos;t want to remember .
i know . kristin i know you don &apos;t
but right now i really need you to try .
ellie needs it .
my team is going to find us .
they &apos;re gonna go to your apartment where we said we were going .
when they see that we &apos;re not there
they &apos;re gonna figure out where we are the same way i did .
and when they do we will bring ellie home
but in order to do that
i &apos;m gonna need you to think .
is matt ...
is he dead ?
kristin please just try to focus on remembering .
ok .
this guy
has been traveling all over the country .
how ?
how did he bring you here ?
in an rv .
an old ...
filthy rv .
hungry ?
ellie ?
don &apos;t worry .
you &apos;ll get used to it .
you let me get away on purpose didn &apos;t you ?
so that they &apos;d open their door .
we &apos;re gonna make a great team .
spicer ?
kurz we got here as fast as we could .
what about kristin ?
she was beaten and sexually assaulted .
she &apos;s out in the ambulance .
and you already know the bad guy took ellie with him .
one more thing--there was another couple murdered
a mile from here an hour ago .
we &apos;ve got a team there
but we &apos;re pretty sure it was the same guy .
where &apos;s matt ?
ah ! damn it . just put a bandage on it
and leave me alone .
how is he ?
it &apos;s nothing hotch .
he needs a cat scan stitches
and a lot of rest .
she &apos;s right morgan .
guys i &apos;m not going to any hospital
until we find that little girl .
now please just put a bandage on it .
morgan what &apos;s the notebook ?
i asked the sister to tell me everything
she could remember about the unsub .
and what &apos;s her condition ?
it &apos;s bad .
i &apos;ll go check on her .
hold on a second fellas .
kristin i &apos;m agent prentiss .
i work with agent morgan .
is it ok if i ride along with you ?
if you &apos;re coming we need to go now .
thank you .
ok we &apos;re good .
how many cops are there in l.a. ?
city or county ?
you actually know the answer .
i know both answers .
it &apos;s white and extremely dirty .
a very old rv .
with a male white in his fifties
accompanied by an 8 @-@ year @-@ old girl .
derek ...
i &apos;m all right .
you don &apos;t look all right .
reid drop it . sorry .
the local bureau office found us these satellite phones .
it should bypass any outage problems on the ground .
good .
any word on ellie ?
i was just--
it &apos;s not you .
between the blackout and the prince of darkness
running around out there be advised to lock your ...
i forgot something .
put the mask back on .
i forgot the radio .
what ?
he listens to his car radio constantly .
the news . he would stop
whenever he would hear something about him--
the radio--he listens--
ok i got it .
he listens to the radio .
put the mask on .
something else .
the other agent-- you have to tell him .
i made him promise ...
garcia .
baby boy you all good ?
listen i need you to run something for me .
you really had us worried . and by &quot; us &quot; i mean me .
i didn &apos;t know where you were--
now garcia .
ok .
all right i &apos;m looking for an old rv .
partial california plates--michael @-@ david @-@ 3 .
that &apos;s all she was able to get .
the victim thinks it may have been
the first 3 letters of the plate but she &apos;s not sure .
yes sir .
all right call me back on this number
as soon as you get a bite .
you know she really needs to be more professional sometimes .
she gets the job done every time .
i told him hotch .
i told him that we should wait for backup
but he wouldn &apos;t listen to me .
we split up and he headed around back
before i could stop him .
morgan sometimes when it comes to family
common sense and procedure go out the window .
we do the best you can .
this unsub raped the aunt
and then beat her for no reason .
she didn &apos;t resist man
and he still pistol @-@ whipped her until her ribs were crushed .
he killed spicer while he was on his knees .
he was unarmed .
this guy &apos;s a pure psychopath .
i want this guy .
we &apos;ll get him .
well we better do it fast .
taking ellie was like a game to him .
the sick bastard thought it was funny .
he &apos;s gonna get pissed off at her man .
she &apos;s nothing but a little girl .
she &apos;s gonna show him fear .
and when she does ...
he &apos;s gonna kill her .
... new permits which provide a sense
of future home construction fell 3.5 ...
we &apos;re not a team .
you got us in .
we did it together .
but i--i didn &apos;t know .
and if i didn &apos;t know we aren &apos;t a team .
yet .
why do you have to kill people ?
my dad says people who hurt other people are cowards
that they never hurt somebody who can protect themselves .
so how would he explain
what happened to him tonight ?
he let you go so that you wouldn &apos;t hurt me .
that doesn &apos;t make you brave .
he let me go ?
to save me .
you &apos;re really not like him at all .
get back
come here .
come here !
should we kill him ?
what ?
no !
you see ellie ?
we are a team .
you just decided to let that man live .
except the question isn &apos;t why do i kill people
the question is why i don &apos;t kill everybody .
i decide who dies
but mostly
i decide who lives .
i &apos;m like ...
god .
and now you are too .
... from l.a. police . they &apos;re now saying
that the prince of darkness may be in an older white rv
making its way around los angeles tonight .
police are advising that anyone seeing
a dirty poorly maintained white rv
contact them immediately
and do not under any circumstances ...
uh @-@ oh .
approach it .
what are you doing ?
even god finds that sometimes
people just have bad luck .
calling someone ?
just calling triple @-@ a .
i got a flat .
just uh trying to get it fixed .
no wait--ohh !
police are also saying that the prince of darkness
may now be traveling with a young girl
an 8 @-@ year @-@ old girl as a hostage .
she &apos;s described as having long brown hair .
police add that you should
notify authorities immediately if you spot her .
all right what we have is an unsub
in complete behavioral chaos .
meaning ?
serial offenders especially long @-@ term successful ones
don &apos;t just suddenly change what they do or how they do it .
going after a high @-@ risk target like a police detective
and then all of a sudden abducting a child
is fairly unheard of .
fairly ?
sometimes they devolve
as they know we &apos;re getting closer to them
and their time &apos;s running out .
but this unsub doesn &apos;t appear to be devolving .
devolution generally means loss of control .
they find it harder and harder
to keep the outside world from noticing them .
i think he &apos;s becoming more controlled .
he spent a lifetime murdering seemingly random victims
then out of nowhere sought out spicer
recreated his parents &apos; murder lured him into a trap
killed him and took his daughter .
the behavioral spectrum is alarmingly different .
yeah garcia .
hi . i want to have better news mon ami
but there are zero rvs in the state of california
with m @-@ d @-@ 3 in that order on the plate . i &apos;m sorry .
sorry &apos;s not helping anybody . i need results .
garcia &apos;s got nothing on the partial plate .
maybe kristin &apos;s wrong .
it &apos;s not surprising
considering her situation at the time .
so how the hell are we supposed to find this guy ?
we can contact him .
... lasers and other technology so sophisticated
images will depict individual telephone poles and boulders .
images will help determine erosion and sea @-@ level changes
and also provide critical information from flood ...
kristin remembered in the ambulance
that the unsub listens to news radio incessantly .
he would even stop assaulting her
if the broadcaster said anything about the prince of darkness .
makes sense for a narcissist .
oh no .
what is it ?
the lapd just put all the information they have out to the press .
what do you mean ?
a spokesperson at the crime scene
was talking about the rv and about ellie .
so this guy knows exactly what we know .
that might force him to dump the rv .
or kill--
no i don &apos;t think so .
why not rossi ?
well he could have killed you and the sister .
he didn &apos;t . he kept you alive .
he can &apos;t be surprised that we know what he &apos;s driving
and that he has a hostage .
but how many news radio stations are there in los angeles ?
i don &apos;t know 20 or so .
we can &apos;t just guess which one he listens to .
what about the emergency alert system ?
it would be a way to
communicate over all the stations simultaneously .
how do we do that ?
i don &apos;t really know . how hard could it be to work out ?
is this your son &apos;s bicycle ?
what the hell ...
i--i may have run it over .
what &apos;d you do back over it again ?
actually twice .
honey ? what was that ?
ellie .
paul ?
you see ellie ?
bicycles mean kids
and kids mean parents who are easy to control .
so go get the boy .
bring him to the parents &apos; room .
paul !
what are you gonna do ?
i have a widow to comfort .
go on .
i am acutely aware that this is an unusual request .
it &apos;s an unusual situation .
then i need to speak to your boss .
no i &apos;m not calling back . transfer me .
uh yes who--who &apos;s this ?
uh and what &apos;s your title sir ?
ok uh i &apos;m agent jennifer jareau the communications liaison
for the fbi &apos;s behavioral analysisi unit .
i need access to the emergency alert system in los angeles
and i was directed to your office .
yeah the emergency alert system .
get the boy in the closet .
what ?
do it !
now !
it &apos;ll be ok i promise .
don &apos;t close the door all the way .
what are you doing ?
i got the boy and i got the clothes .
so ?
so you said if i did what you told me
then you &apos;d let them live .
really . go in the bathroom and close the door .
damn it !
he has a brother .
i told him to tell the neighbors to call the police
and then tell the next house
and the next house and the next house .
you know he &apos;s probably told the whole block by now .
can &apos;t kill them all can you ?
i can try .
come on .
kristin wanted me to tell you
she &apos;s sorry she made you promise her brother .
she said it wasn &apos;t fair .
you want to tell me what she made you promise ?
that i wouldn &apos;t let anything happen to ellie .
well she &apos;s right . that &apos;s not fair .
how is anything we handle out here fair ?
every time they put me on hold
i get one layer higher on homeland security .
the e.a.s. is coordinated by the fcc fema
and the national weather service .
it &apos;s a bureaucratic pile of steaming--
um ma &apos;am ?
yes ?
thank you for holding .
yes
i &apos;m with the fbi . we &apos;re here in los angeles .
a boy just woke up his neighbors .
said he escaped from the prince of darkness .
what ?
he said they &apos;re still in his house right now .
they ?
there &apos;s a girl with him .
let me know .
yeah .
we got you man !
there he is !
that &apos;s him !
get in there .
keys .
always by the door .
come on .
go on .
go on ! get in the car !
go on !
what &apos;s the matter scared ?
shut up .
the neighbors all banded together and came after him
but he was already in the car .
ballsy neighbors .
california has its moments .
the first units all got here within 4 minutes of the call .
local watch commander locked down a 5 @-@ square @-@ mile grid
and there &apos;s an apb on the car .
we believe they never made it out of the area .
tell your officers not to approach him if they spot him .
he &apos;s getting desperate .
won &apos;t be easy with a cop @-@ killer .
then you &apos;d better ask them
how they &apos;d feel about getting that cop &apos;s daughter killed .
he cut her hair .
i swear to god when i get my hands on this son of a--
it actually might be good .
why disguise somebody you &apos;re gonna kill ?
here &apos;s how he stays awake all night .
look at this article on spicer .
we already know he was obsessed
with all the attention spicer was getting .
yeah but look what &apos;s underlined 3 times .
&quot; 8 @-@ year @-@ old ellie bright happy child . &quot;
this one &apos;s just ...
special .
&quot; i don &apos;t normally take to kids
but this one &apos;s just special . &quot;
what ?
that &apos;s what he said back at the house .
ellie was his target all along not spicer .
yes . yes i &apos;m still here .
yep i &apos;m always gonna be here .
ok . my name is jennifer--
no . do you know what ?
i &apos;m not going to explain this entire thing again
to another mid @-@ level bureaucrat
who can &apos;t give me a sufficient answer .
put someone on the damn phone who can authorize what i need .
he wasn &apos;t after spicer .
we were just coming to the same conclusion .
it doesn &apos;t make sense he hasn &apos;t killed the girl
if she wasn &apos;t what he was after .
he disguised her to keep her .
look at this . there &apos;s a stack of them in the rv .
reid &apos;s reading them all right now .
so we profiled his obsession with spicer
was over not getting credit for his law enforcement career .
but maybe it &apos;s the daughter he &apos;s not getting credit for .
he thinks he &apos;s responsible for her .
well she wouldn &apos;t even be here
if he hadn &apos;t allowed spicer to live 25 years ago .
a bastardized version of a grandparent .
that &apos;s a pretty twisted delusion .
well it only has to make sense to him .
and when a delusion like that crashes it crashes hard .
hey guys .
the murders we found in orange county in 1985
they might not have been his first .
why did you do this ? we were gonna be a--
i told you .
we &apos;re not a team .
not a team ?
we were going to--
i was nice to you .
the lights are back on
just in time for morning of course .
in other news the noose is
getting tighter around the prince of darkness .
the lapd believe they &apos;ve narrowed down
the area of the city he &apos;s in .
yes . i &apos;m--
yes ma &apos;am .
uh yes madame secretary .
i &apos;m so sorry to bother you this early but it &apos;s very--
oh you have . fully briefed great .
um--yeah of course . i &apos;m writing down the number
right now .
great .
thank you so much madame secretary .
yeah yeah i will let you know how it goes .
great . thank you .
hotchner .
we have access to the local emergency alert system .
the secretary personally set it up herself .
it &apos;s in the city command center .
good . get an lpad unit to take you over there
get the system up and running
and i need you to start talking to him immediately .
excuse me ?
it &apos;s gonna take me too long to get there from here .
i need you to talk to him jj .
me ?
i &apos;ll give you some strategies .
the unsub may still be in this area
and if he surfaces we need to be close .
i &apos;m not a hostage negotiator .
i &apos;m sorry . you are today .
dr. reid you &apos;re on your own cellular .
yeah . the power came back here a few minutes ago .
how &apos;s my main man doing ?
on the completely safe assumption
that you &apos;re not talking about me
let &apos;s just say i wouldn &apos;t want to be this unsub
when morgan finally gets his hands on him .
that bad huh ?
has he ever yelled at you before ?
touche .
how can i be of service ?
how far back can you go with your records garcia ?
how far back you talkin &apos; ?
uh a murder investigation from 1968 .
this is the room .
so what do i do ?
flip that switch when you &apos;re ready
and you &apos;ll cut into every signal on the radio bands am and fm .
that &apos;s it ?
it &apos;s made to be easy .
ok . thank you .
jj .
i &apos;m here .
we &apos;re gathering some background information
on flynn that could be very helpful .
just sit tight for a minute .
ok .
you ok ?
hotch ...
what if i mess up ?
don &apos;t worry . you won &apos;t .
i &apos;ll call you right back .
now ...
get inside .
get inside and don &apos;t come out until i call for you !
already ?
do you doubt it ?
yeah i &apos;ll put you on speaker .
ok . let me preface this by saying
that a 40 @-@ year @-@ old murder in a suburb of los angeles
is an absurdly impossible request .
having said that yours truly
happens to know that the pollack library at cal state--
garcia .
yes sir sorry uh ...
anyway this murder was quite the scandal .
for southern california in the sixties that &apos;s saying something .
ok i don &apos;t know who was talking right then
but ... word .
so nora flynn was a prostitute and a drug addict
living in a desert community just outside of los angeles .
it appears bikers were her stock in trade rough bikers
and one fateful day she and her client
were murdered by her 13 @-@ year @-@ old son billy .
shot to death .
the customer ironically named john
was able to tell the police before he died
that billy made him beg for his life and then shot him anyway .
that &apos;s him .
and he was convicted but ...
right . he &apos;s a juvenile .
so at 18 he was released in 1973
never heard from again .
oh he was heard from .
and he never released a statement
as to why he killed them
although it does appear his childhood was horrific .
i &apos;m sending you a picture
of him on the day he was released to your pdas .
make sure you send the files to jj .
of course my liege .
garcia bids you ad--
garcia wait a minute .
hey .
hey back .
baby girl i &apos;m sorry for taking your head off .
oh darling our love is a rock .
no bad day can come between us .
word .
come home safe .
i &apos;ll leave a light on .
hotch .
jj listen .
the most important thing is that you build rapport with him .
uh rapport . ok .
i &apos;m asking you to do one of the hardest things
that anybody in our position ever has to do .
i need you to empathize with him . sympathize .
don &apos;t judge the things he &apos;s done .
garcia &apos;s sending you a file on him and his childhood .
look it over . it &apos;ll help .
if he hears that you care about him
that &apos;s how you &apos;re gonna get him to care about ellie .
he has to understand that he &apos;s putting her through the same pain
he went through as a child .
uh ok .
but it has to be his decision
because power is all @-@ important to him .
power ? ok .
you &apos;re gonna be fine .
just talk to him .
all right .
go over the file and start when you &apos;re ready .
oh wait . you &apos;re gonna be on the line right ?
i &apos;ll be listening .
and the heat wave continues to be the top story in the southland
with temperatures expected to top 105 degrees
and excessive heat ...
come on billy i bought you from your mama .
this man paid good money .
mom ! no !
do as you &apos;re told !
mom ! make him stop !
i &apos;ll be gentle billy . don &apos;t worry .
no !
billy ?
billy flynn ?
did you--
who &apos;s billy flynn ?
mr. flynn i-- i don &apos;t know for sure
that you can hear me but--
my name is jennifer jareau .
i--i work for the fbi as a communications liaison
for the--the behavioral uh ...
ok . mr. flynn i--
i--i want to talk to you about letting ellie spicer go .
i mean i want to ask you to .
uh see i &apos;m not a hostage negotiator uh
i &apos;ve never done anything like this at all ever
but um sometimes circumstances it &apos;s ...
look ...
you can tell i &apos;m not a hostage negotiator .
but i am a mother .
and i ...
i know what your mother did to you when you were little .
what she was
what she made you watch what she let men do to you
and it makes me so ...
it &apos;s just not fair .
and no one-- no one can make that better .
i wish i could . i do . but ...
if i--if i could somehow go back there
and you know make what was happening to you stop
if i could just ...
you know pick you up and just tell you
that it &apos;ll all be ok .
that &apos;s what moms are supposed to do .
they &apos;re not supposed to be the cause of your pain
they &apos;re supposed to make it go away .
they &apos;re supposed to hold you
and tell you everything is gonna be all right .
they &apos;re supposed to tell you that thunder is angels bowling
and that it &apos;s ok to be afraid of the dark
and that it &apos;s not silly to think there might be monsters in your closet
and that it &apos;s ok that if you want to climb in bed with them just this once
&apos;cause it &apos;s scary in the room all alone .
they &apos;re supposed to say it &apos;s ok to be afraid
and not be the thing you &apos;re afraid of .
but most importantly
they &apos;re supposed to love you no matter what .
what happened to you isn &apos;t fair it &apos;s not right
but um ...
i &apos;m supposed to empathize with you .
sympathize . understand .
but i can &apos;t .
that--that would be a lie .
the truth is i don &apos;t understand what you &apos;ve done .
i don &apos;t sympathize with you killing people all these years .
and i especially don &apos;t understand you taking ellie .
what i can do is tell you what a mother should tell you
that you can &apos;t take away your pain
by hurting someone else .
that it doesn &apos;t make all the nights
you went to bed scared and alone
any better if you scare someone else
the way you &apos;re scaring ellie .
what happened to you it isn &apos;t fair .
but what you &apos;re doing to her isn &apos;t fair either
and if anyone should understand what that feels like
it &apos;s you .
you have the power .
you can do what you want to do .
but for once
you can choose to use that power
to do for ellie what should have been done for you .
you can choose letting her go .
you can choose teaching her
that yes there are monsters
and it &apos;s ok to be afraid of them .
but it &apos;s not ok to let them win .
and it &apos;s not ok to be one .
agent prentiss .
yes . hello doctor .
yes sir .
thank you .
both of kristin &apos;s lungs collapsed .
she died a few minutes ago .
ellie &apos;s got no one now .
kurzbard .
he let her go .
where ?
he got out of the car and he just let her go .
she &apos;s in a house about 6 blocks from here .
where is he now ?
he &apos;s in another house up the street .
jj . i don &apos;t know if you know . he let her go .
you did it .
we have swat on the way kurz .
and an hpt team .
yeah but they &apos;ll be a while .
we had a phone sent in with a direct line to this one
but so far--
he &apos;s watching us .
this is detective kurzbard lapd .
he wants to talk to you .
what ?
he wants me to come in .
morgan .
i know this guy hotch .
he didn &apos;t kill me before he &apos;s not gonna kill me this time .
no .
i believe in my original profile .
he will not hurt me unless i show him fear .
listen ...
when you needed us we were there for you .
this one is mine .
you sure ?
as i &apos;ve ever been .
in here agent .
it &apos;s over flynn .
5 years ago
i would have just killed you right there in that bedroom .
you couldn &apos;t .
couldn &apos;t ?
i &apos;m not afraid of you .
you really think that matters that much to me ?
then shoot me .
go ahead . shoot me .
you can &apos;t do it .
i study guys like you for a living .
i know more about you than you know about yourself .
well you may not be afraid but they are .
you point that gun at them and i will kill you
and that is another promise .
my mother used to dance with me .
you know who cyd charisse was ?
she kind of looked like her .
put the gun down and get up .
when i shot her ...
she looked at me with such ...
she was ...
i think relieved .
i think i helped her escape .
was that really true or did i just imagine it
to make killing her easier to live with ?
did i help her escape ?
did i ...
set her free ?
is that what you think you &apos;ve been doing all these years
helping people ?
well no i suppose not .
do you believe in heaven ?
this is your last chance .
you think i might see her there ?
maybe get a second chance ?
i &apos;d really like that .
&quot; a family is a place where minds come in contact with one another .
&quot; if these minds love one another
&quot; the home will be as beautiful as a flower garden .
&quot; but if these minds get out of harmony with one another
it is like a storm that plays havoc with the garden . &quot;
