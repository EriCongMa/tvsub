it &apos;s the perfect hideaway--
an empty bed and breakfast ,
i think we should go check it out .
are you stopping ?
no .
i &apos;m not doing anything .
the engine stopped working .
maggie is trying to prevent me from seeing malcolm .
i didn &apos;t know that you wanted that .
sorry .
maybe we should give this a little more time .
i &apos;m officer holbrooke .
my partner and i are investigating the murders of officer reynolds
and detective wilden .
we could have this place .
it could be our secret .
look , i took pictures of some of the stories in ali &apos;s journal
before &quot; a &quot; got it .
ali wants to meet me tonight .
well , you &apos;re not going alone .
that &apos;s the only way she &apos;ll meet me .
did you tell anyone about this ?
i can &apos;t believe you followed me here .
she can trust you but not the rest of us ?
she &apos;s trying to divide us .
you &apos;re doing a really good job of that all on your own .
i &apos;m sorry .
don &apos;t !
well , i missed , like , half the movie .
that dude that was sitting in front of us
kept making sales calls .
sales calls ? i thought he was breaking up with somebody .
he was . his car .
i swear , if spencer was there ,
she would &apos;ve pegged him with her jelly beans .
okay , i &apos;m sorry .
but seriously . you cannot hold onto this .
spencer was just trying to protect you .
no , she was trying to control the situation .
like she always does .
emily , look , she thought that you were making a mistake .
i did . by trusting her .
em ...
no , i was this close
to finding out from alison
what happened that night she disappeared .
and now we &apos;ll never hear from her again .
mike ?
what the hell is this ?
dad said i could have a few friends over .
this is not a &quot; few friends . &quot;
aria , chill .
no , i &apos;m not &quot; chillin &apos; &quot; !
dad left me in charge for the weekend ,
and i don &apos;t wanna spend the next two days
peeling pepperoni off the walls .
uh , hello ?
this is somebody &apos;s desk .
move it !
okay , people are still eating .
well , tell them it &apos;s take @-@ out . i &apos;m going upstairs , okay ?
you have ten minutes to clear all this people out of here .
all right ?
come on , em .
yeah ?
hey , in ali &apos;s story about her date with an older guy ,
are they talking about
&quot; novels and travel &quot; or &quot; shovels and gravel &quot; ?
i &apos;m trying to piece this together .
her handwriting is so sloppy .
it &apos;s like doing mad libs in reverse .
but ali on a date with a mystery dude ,
it seems kind of important .
okay , well , the &quot; mystery dude &quot;
we should be focusing on is patterson .
patterson ? isn &apos;t that that kid in world history
who &apos;s always sniffing his fingers ?
no , james patterson , the author .
this guy just gets the criminal mind .
okay , first of all ,
when were you interested in anybody born before 1989 ?
think about it .
the person who tried to kill alison
dumped some random into a hole
and tried to make her look like ali .
maybe we shouldn &apos;t refer to the dead girl as a &quot; random . &quot;
look , if we follow the trail of &quot; a &quot; &apos; s cover @-@ up ,
it could lead us right back to &quot; a. &quot;
spencer , this guy &apos;s a genius .
it &apos;s the third book of his i &apos;ve read this week .
is travis reading them to you ?
no . i &apos;m not seeing him anymore .
i decided not to rush into anything .
wait , so you stayed home to read a book
instead of going to that chick @-@ flick with aria and emily ?
well , i wasn &apos;t invited .
why ?
why ?
because emily is so pissed at you
that she &apos;s pissed at me for not being pissed at you .
where is your dad anyway ?
he &apos;s teaching in syracuse .
i swear , the next time he &apos;s out of town ,
i am so staying at your place .
hello there .
what are you doing here ?
using the restroom facilities .
i don &apos;t have a toilet in my bedroom , mona .
what are you doing in my house ?
i was invited here .
by mike .
mike invited you ?
here ? why ?
this may come as a shock to you , emily ,
but some people don &apos;t tuck &apos; n roll every time i walk into a room .
love your wallpaper , by the way .
it &apos;s so you .
mike .
what &apos;s up ?
can you come in for a sec ?
look , i promise i &apos;m not trying to be a hard @-@ ass , okay ?
we just-- we haven &apos;t really had a chance to talk about last night .
i &apos;ll finish cleaning after school .
wait .
what &apos;s the deal with mona ?
uh , we met in a group at school .
and we have a lot of friends in common .
what group ?
it &apos;s a discussion group .
in the counseling center .
we meet up after school and talk about stuff .
like what ? terror @-@ tactics ?
mr. fazelli knows mona &apos;s past .
fazelli retired .
there &apos;s a new counselor and he &apos;s actually cool .
well , i &apos;m not cool with you cozying up to someone
who spent junior year torturing me .
i mean , seriously . was mona here to poop or snoop ?
all right , i &apos;ve gotta go .
mona is a very dangerous person , mike .
she wasn &apos;t sent to radley for spa treatments .
are you finished ?
mona broke up our parents , all right ?
she &apos;s the one who wrote to mom about dad and meredith .
our parents broke themselves up , aria .
maybe it &apos;s time you let go of that and stop judging .
how am i ...
people make mistakes , okay ?
i &apos;ve done a lot of crap that i &apos;m not real proud of myself .
and i &apos;m sure someone &apos;s standing right now in another bedroom ,
talking smack about me .
there &apos;s no comparison .
mona tried to destroy our family .
well , if you &apos;ve forgiven dad ,
why can &apos;t you forgive the messenger ?
hey , sweetie .
i went and i spoke with the mechanic myself .
did he say why it stopped ?
well , he said it was some kind of computer glitch .
but i drove it home and it runs fine .
dad , it was working fine that night .
then suddenly the gps had , like ,
a stroke or something and the engine stopped .
well , he said something probably triggered the anti @-@ theft device
and shut it down from a remote location .
baby , you &apos;re just driving it to school .
i think if you stay close , it &apos;ll be fine .
i &apos;ll take my bike .
you know , um ...
i would &apos;ve taken a temporary furlough sooner
if i &apos;d known how shaken up you were about things .
i &apos;m not shaken up .
emily , a car plowed into the living room ,
almost killing you and your ma .
and the fact that the police don &apos;t know who was driving ...
it has nothing to do with the accident .
well , something &apos;s not right .
you &apos;re not eating , you &apos;re acting jumpy .
it &apos;s called senior year , okay ?
i don &apos;t know what school i &apos;m going to .
there &apos;s a lot of questions .
i &apos;ll get through it .
okay . i &apos;d still like you to drive to school .
they say it &apos;s gonna rain later .
i &apos;m taking my bike . thanks .
so what exactly was the problem ?
the landlord &apos;s being a jerk because i broke the lease .
he &apos;s withholding my deposit till i give back all the keys .
maybe i could pick up malcolm early
while you deal with the landlord .
malcolm &apos;s not here . he &apos;s at home .
as in seattle ?
yes , as in seattle . that &apos;s home .
i thought you were bringing him back .
i changed my mind .
i &apos;m just here to deal with the lease
and ship back some boxes i left in storage .
so , what &apos;re you saying , maggie ?
that i &apos;m not gonna have a connection to malcolm
unless it &apos;s through an attorney ?
oh , um ... i &apos;ll just come back later .
no , we &apos;re done . i was just leaving .
i &apos;m sorry , i didn &apos;t know that she was here .
no , that &apos;s okay . that was not going to a good place .
how can she talk to you like that after everything that she &apos;s--
flying off the handle isn &apos;t gonna help anything , aria .
people get what they deserve .
eventually .
that &apos;s a keeper .
if you like that series ,
you should really check out some of the swedish authors .
for some reason ,
they do meatballs and crime novels better than anyone else .
i hate their meatballs .
i ... i really came over to apologize .
my job , it isn &apos;t easy .
but it is especially hard when you realize
that you &apos;ve turned innocent people
into collateral damage during an investigation .
what i &apos;m trying to say is ,
i hope that you and your mom are okay .
we &apos;re okay .
good .
here .
get this .
you won &apos;t regret it .
em , i just got your text .
what did your dad say ?
it &apos;s what he didn &apos;t say .
&quot; a &quot; killed my car in the woods last week .
what &apos;s next ?
we don &apos;t know that for sure . we need more proof .
do we ? come to the brew later .
you can watch &quot; a &quot; program
the cappuccino machine to melt my face off .
emily .
no , i don &apos;t even feel safe in my own house anymore !
look , if &quot; a &quot; did hack into your car ,
wouldn &apos;t he own up to it by now ?
the sociopathic mind feeds on intricate patterns .
hanna , please stop reading . you &apos;re not a detective .
every rock you turn over gets picked up and hurled at alison .
you can pass that on to spencer , too .
can you please bury the hatchet with her ?
i &apos;m sick of taking sides .
no one &apos;s asked you to .
em , i &apos;ve been through this with my parents , okay ?
it sucks and nobody wins .
um , emily , can i please just say one thing ?
okay , stop .
what &apos;re you up to ?
excuse me ?
drop the cougar @-@ crap
and tell me why you &apos;re after a 10th grader .
what turns you on ?
the fact that he shares my dna
or that you have full access to my bedroom ?
okay . jesse warned me that this would happen .
who &apos;s jesse ?
the new guidance counselor that &apos;s the best thing
that &apos;s happened to this friggin &apos; school
since we got a coffee cart .
he sees through the bull and he has a gift
of bringing together people who need each other .
oh , so you &apos;re gonna tell me
that jesse made this little love @-@ connection ?
mona , when it comes to me and my friends ,
you always have an agenda .
no , you and your friends are the ones with the agenda , aria .
after i helped hanna &apos;s mom get out of jail ,
i was burned off like a wart .
that &apos;s not exactly what happened .
really ? then tell me . what happened ?
why was i iced out after the charges were dropped ?
why did the inner circle squeeze me out again ?
right .
well , i &apos;m tired of being yoyo &apos;ed ,
and i am hanging out with a different crowd now .
so suck it up , aria .
oh , hey , andrew .
ladies first .
oh , no , it &apos;s fine . i &apos;ll come back later .
wait up , killer .
wanna quiz each other on the way to class ?
quiz each other for what ?
you serious ?
did you space on the physics test ?
oh , my god . oh , my god !
i &apos;ll take that as a &quot; yes . &quot;
um ... yeah , i &apos;m just gonna wing it .
this isn &apos;t winging material .
i &apos;ve been up all night cramming .
if you &apos;ve been up all night , how come you don &apos;t look like ...
me ?
sleep is overrated .
okay .
um ... you know what ? actually , could you cover for me ?
and then if you &apos;re not too busy after school ,
maybe you could come by and give me your physics notes .
yeah .
thanks .
mr. fitz ?
you wanted to see me ?
yes , i did .
please come in .
and close the door .
where &apos;s my book ? okay , it was right here .
please tell me you didn &apos;t throw it away .
i &apos;m on the last two pages !
thank you .
last two pages , huh ? i &apos;m impressed .
oh , well , i always read the endings first .
what ? of a mystery ? that &apos;s crazy .
no , it &apos;s not .
how else am i supposed to know what clues to look for ?
all right , go back .
you &apos;ve gotta read the middle . it &apos;s the big twist .
you &apos;re missing the best part of the book .
well , so far , all i &apos;m missing
is a reindeer sighting
and a canoe trip down a fjord .
what ? how do you say it ?
you were close .
all right , so what &apos;s the twist ?
no way , uh @-@ uh .
i &apos;m not into giving spoilers .
oh , come on . you owe me .
all right .
all i &apos;ll say is that it has to do with the dental records .
the ones they used to i.d. the body ?
it always comes down to teeth , doesn &apos;t it ?
hi . are you jesse ?
i am . did we schedule an appointment ?
no , i was just dropping by to--
oh , well , let &apos;s not talk in the doorway . please , come in .
okay .
what &apos;s your name ?
aria montgomery . i &apos;m mike &apos;s sister .
wow . mr. fazelli is definitely gone .
do you miss him ?
what ? oh , no .
he was kinda old school .
his head sweat a lot .
like a cheese .
aria , please . have a seat .
i was just a little curious about mike &apos;s group .
can anyone join or did you handpick the students yourself ?
it &apos;s open to everyone .
i did reach out to certain individuals
who i know have been through some rough patches .
why ?
well , it &apos;s just ...
my little brother has , um ...
he &apos;s befriended this certain individual who &apos;s bad news .
bad news ?
yeah .
can you be more specific ?
you &apos;re referring to mona .
well , at least you agree .
i didn &apos;t say i agreed . but i made an educated guess .
so how can i help you ?
look , how do i say this without sounding rude ?
try .
mona &apos;s the devil .
and i would really , really appreciate it
if you didn &apos;t encourage them being together .
sounds like you still have some unresolved issues with mona .
if i started , we &apos;d be here till friday .
well , let &apos;s start on tuesday .
sounds like you could really benefit from joining our group .
oh , no , you don &apos;t understand . this isn &apos;t about me .
aria , it &apos;s a safe place .
it &apos;s a place where you can explore your anger .
i &apos;m not angry !
i &apos;m just concerned .
and this individual &apos;s history supports it .
well , i don &apos;t discourage friendships .
if two students bond ,
it &apos;s because they &apos;ve found common ground .
right .
okay , well , thanks for hearing me out .
any time .
mr. fitz ?
mr. fields , emily didn &apos;t tell me you were back in town .
i asked my c.o. for a little personal time .
given all the things
that have been happening here on the home front .
yes , well , it &apos;s been
an eventful couple of months for emily .
has it affected her schoolwork ?
i don &apos;t think so .
i mean , senior year can be quite--
rough , yeah , that &apos;s what she says .
honestly , i think it &apos;s something more than that .
staying at the dilaurentis house , that may &apos;ve been a mistake .
my wife tells me that alison &apos;s mother , well ...
she acts as if her daughter is gonna walk through the door again .
and emily stayed and slept in her dead friend &apos;s bedroom ,
and i think it took a toll on her .
yes , well , i imagine it would .
how can i help ?
well , you seem to be one
of the few teachers she feels connected to .
i think she really trusts you .
and , well , i &apos;m wondering if you might be able to
help get her back on track .
well , i could give her some sort of extra @-@ curricular project .
something she can really throw herself into after school .
i think that might do her a world of good .
well , i &apos;m happy to be here for her .
i do appreciate it .
take care .
you , too .
so one misconception is that a net force is required to
keep a body in motion ,
when in fact it &apos;s needed to change
whatever current state of motion the body is in .
did you get that ?
uh , yeah , i think i did .
nice room . lot of ribbons .
jumping , dressage ...
all these medals from riding ?
yeah .
i &apos;ve got everything in here but the horse .
how many hours would you say you studied for this ? in a row ?
i don &apos;t know , like , seven .
so you &apos;re gonna need to know a lot about newton for this .
andrew ...
i didn &apos;t ask you here to study , andrew .
you didn &apos;t ?
i &apos;ve been watching you .
you have ?
you &apos;re the captain of the decathlon team ,
you &apos;re a starting forward , and summa cum laude .
it &apos;s time to share , andrew .
okay .
i &apos;m just ... i &apos;m not interested in your notes , okay ?
i want some of your study aid .
you know , the kind with the childproof cap ?
i need to stay up for a while .
i don &apos;t have any of that .
andrew , come on .
i &apos;m your study @-@ buddy for , like , three classes .
plus , once i showed you my side boob .
i have a legit prescription . i can give you a few but ...
i just need enough to get through the week .
i knew something was up .
what ?
since when does spencer hastings trust anyone &apos;s notes
but her own ?
why &apos;d you come here then ?
i don &apos;t know . i thought maybe you were done with that carpenter .
thanks .
dad ?
oh , my god ! i &apos;m sorry ! i &apos;m sorry !
are you all right ? it &apos;s okay . it &apos;s okay .
&quot; we &apos;re at a college bar .
the hart and huntsman .
he likes to take me there .
but he doesn &apos;t like to call them &apos; dates . &apos; &quot;
so what do you think about my stories ?
&quot; you have a strong voice . &quot;
but ... ?
&quot; but nothing .
it &apos;s only gonna get more distinctive as you grow up . &quot;
grow up ?
&quot; you know what i mean . mature . &quot;
so you don &apos;t think that i &apos;m mature enough ?
&quot; i didn &apos;t say that .
i just think all great literature boils down to two themes :
love and death . &quot;
whatever .
i don &apos;t know why i &apos;m taking advice
from someone who doesn &apos;t know how to order .
who eats boysenberry pie with beer ?
&quot; don &apos;t knock it till you try it . &quot;
i should write a story about you .
maybe i &apos;ll write one about this moment ... right now .
you &apos;re lucky my mom finished her box of chardonnay .
do you know how loud you were ?
you weren &apos;t answering your phone .
spencer , do you know what time it is ?
no , i never went to bed .
it &apos;s four .
look , who cares , okay ?
i finally got a lead . it &apos;s the hart and huntsman .
what ?
it &apos;s this pub .
it &apos;s a bar outside of hollis college ,
where ali &apos;s mystery man took her for pie and beer .
do you wanna come with me ?
now ? i &apos;m not wearing any underwear .
no , after fifth period .
no . no , i can &apos;t . i scheduled a cleaning at the dentist .
you &apos;re gonna pass up finding the person
who &apos;s after ali to get your plaque scraped ?
spence , don &apos;t you get it ? ali went to the same dentist .
the police used dental records to prove that body was alison &apos;s ,
and we know it wasn &apos;t .
so someone switched the x @-@ rays
to match whoever was in that grave .
okay .
if i find out who was in that office
after they found the body ,
we &apos;re that much closer to finding out who &quot; a &quot; is .
so you think that &quot; a &quot; went in there as a patient ?
it &apos;s better than breaking in .
and i know where they keep those records .
i used to file them .
okay .
okay , so you go to the dentist , and i &apos;ll go to the pub .
should we update aria and emily about any of this ?
no , emily will lose it
if she thinks that we &apos;re hunting down clues again .
i don &apos;t think i can make her any angrier than she already is .
spence , this isn &apos;t forever .
once we find out who &quot; a &quot; is , all will be forgiven .
yeah .
hey there .
oh , hi .
um , it &apos;s okay if i park here , right ?
well , it depends .
how long do you plan on staying ?
just as long as it takes me to mail this .
then that &apos;s it ?
then you &apos;re out of here for good ?
i think so . why ?
you know how badly ezra wanted to see malcolm .
so coming up here without him was a really nasty thing to do .
aria , it &apos;s really none of your business .
oh , really ?
well , it sure was when you asked me
not to tell ezra that malcolm was his kid .
if you &apos;ll excuse me ...
no .
no , there is no excuse
for someone to lie about something like that
and screw up someone &apos;s life .
and if you count malcolm , that &apos;s two people .
i didn &apos;t realize that you and mr. fitz were still so close .
he &apos;s lucky to have a student who &apos;s so protective of him .
well , mr. fitz is too much of a gentleman
to kick you to the curb .
but somebody needs to .
i &apos;m guessing that you &apos;ve done some lying yourself
when it comes to mr. fitz .
yeah , but it &apos;s not the kind that includes blackmailing his family
into paying for a three bedroom house and a fancy summer camp .
well , that &apos;s rich , coming from a kid
who maintains her grade point average
by sleeping with her teacher .
oh , my god . i &apos;m sorry .
just leave it .
you ran away ?
no . i walked . fast .
i basically just made things worse for ezra .
she &apos;ll make sure that he never sees malcolm ever again .
it &apos;s not like he asked you to confront her .
it happened in the moment .
it doesn &apos;t even matter . once she tells him--
aria , you were acting as his friend , okay ?
he &apos;s not gonna be that mad .
plus , it &apos;s not like you &apos;re still seeing him .
all right , well , if i skip his class ,
will you cover for me ?
just in case he asks .
i &apos;ll try . i &apos;ll be seeing fitz out of class , too .
my dad drafted me to co @-@ direct the spring play with him .
what ? why ?
my dad thinks i &apos;m a basket @-@ case .
because you won &apos;t drive your car ?
because i tried to stab him with scissors .
your dad ? what--
i gotta go .
sean &apos;s coming home from boarding school soon .
he made quite a splash there .
especially with the ladies .
looks like i missed out .
you have a loose filling in number 29 .
dr. ackard &apos;s gonna have to take a look at that .
today ? how long is that gonna take ?
why ? are you in a rush ?
no .
tooth decay leads to heart disease , hanna .
didn &apos;t you learn that when you worked here ?
yeah . yeah , i know .
well , then i &apos;m just gonna go back to the waiting room .
oh , no , you &apos;re fine right here , hon. just sit tight .
mr. fitz ?
hey . spencer , uh ...
sorry , i didn &apos;t mean to interrupt . i just ...
no , it &apos;s okay .
i just didn &apos;t expect to see you in this setting .
have you been here before ?
no . no , i never have .
that looks good . what is it ?
boysenberry .
or actually it might be blackberry .
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m going off a recommendation from the waitress .
oh , excuse me , could i actually cancel the rest of my order ?
i didn &apos;t realize how late it was
and i actually need to get going .
no problem .
great .
sorry to run out on you . are you meeting someone here ?
yeah , i am .
great . well , it was great running into you .
try the pie . it &apos;s pretty great .
yeah .
yeah , so i &apos;ve heard .
hey , it &apos;s me .
i was just wondering if maggie had called .
look , i didn &apos;t mean to go off on her like that .
she &apos;s probably already called her lawyer and told her
that you &apos;re involved with some violent psychotic freak .
i don &apos;t know what came over me .
i think i &apos;m just so angry and ...
just call me when you can .
or not .
bye .
okay , hanna ...
dr. ackard , it looks like hanna marin couldn &apos;t wait .
so i &apos;ll call her tomorrow to schedule a follow @-@ up .
she was the last on the books , so i &apos;m going to head out .
i &apos;ll see you in the morning .
thank you .
how &apos;s it going ?
hey . good .
been at it for a while over there , huh ?
yeah , it &apos;s a history paper , so there &apos;s a lot of reading .
i wanted to ask you ,
have you given any more thought to joining our group ?
um ... no .
look , jesse , i &apos;m not totally clueless .
i know that there &apos;s some things that i need to work through .
i just need an outlet , like ...
roller derby ?
you have a group for that , too ?
no , but i got basketball .
saturday morning pick @-@ up games .
i &apos;ll pass .
fair enough .
well , i want you to know
i &apos;m always available for a one @-@ on @-@ one meeting .
my door is always open .
all right .
thank you .
i just ...
i really don &apos;t want to lose my brother .
would you like to sit down ?
what ? no . no , i gotta go .
thanks .
hey , dr. ackard . you know ,
i think it &apos;s really great that sean &apos;s coming back .
i feel bad that we lost touch .
i hope he &apos;s not mad at me for--
what &apos;s this ?
he already paid for it , so i figured why not ?
but if anyone asks , i checked your i.d.
boysenberry pie and beer ? that &apos;s what he ordered ?
i know , kinda gross , right ?
yeah . thanks .
so what do you think about my stories ?
you have a very strong voice .
but ... ?
but nothing .
it &apos;s just going to get more distinctive as you grow up .
grow up ?
you know what i mean .
more ... mature .
oh . so you don &apos;t think that i &apos;m mature enough ?
no , i never said that .
i just think that all great literature boils down to two themes :
love and death .
whatever .
i don &apos;t know why i &apos;m taking advice
from someone who doesn &apos;t know how to order .
who eats boysenberry pie with beer ?
do not knock it until you try it .
i should write a story about you .
maybe i &apos;ll even write one about this moment ...
right now .
mr. fitz ?
mr. fitz , is that you ?
dad ?
dad , are you there ?
i need you to come to the school and pick me up .
mr. fitz isn &apos;t here ,
and i don &apos;t want to be here by myself because--
anyway , as soon as you get this message ,
please come to the school and pick me up immediately .
i &apos;m here . i &apos;m in the back hall .
dad ! dad , i &apos;m up here !
dad ! come on !
dad , i &apos;m up here !
